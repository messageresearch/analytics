[0:00] spoke out the judgment of this man in
[0:02] the story you know the story where he
[0:03] just spoke the judge and he said this
[0:05] man needs to be killed that was the
[0:07] judgment
[0:08] but when when david
[0:10] offered that judgment call he didn't
[0:13] realize if he's putting judgment back on
[0:15] himself because he was the one that was
[0:16] doing it
[0:18] so
[0:19] we learned a lot of lessons from this so
[0:20] i just want to pick it up here this
[0:21] morning in verse 7 and nathan said to
[0:24] david thou art the man
[0:26] thus saith the lord god of israel i
[0:27] anointed thee king over israel i
[0:29] delivered thee out of the hand of saul
[0:31] and i gave thee thy master's house and
[0:33] thy masters wives into thy bosom and
[0:36] gave thee the house of israel of judah
[0:38] and if that had been too little i would
[0:41] moreover have given unto thee such and
[0:43] such things
[0:44] wherefore hast thou despise the
[0:46] commandment of the lord to do evil in
[0:47] his sight
[0:49] thou has killed uriah the hittite with
[0:51] the sword and has taken his wife to be
[0:54] thy wife and has slain him with the
[0:56] sword of the children of ammon
[1:00] and um
[1:01] we realized then that the uriah was
[1:03] killed because you know he took his wife
[1:05] and then he had uriah killed on the uh
[1:07] out in the war so you know that story
[1:09] you're familiar with that
[1:11] god speaking back to him so now watch
[1:13] now the judgments come from god verse 10
[1:16] now therefore the sword shall never
[1:18] depart from thine house david the sword
[1:21] will never depart from thine house
[1:23] because thou has despised me and has
[1:25] taken the wife of uriah the hittite to
[1:28] be thy wife
[1:29] thus saith the lord behold i will raise
[1:31] up evil against so now the judgments
[1:33] continue i will raise up evil against
[1:36] thee out of thine own house and i will
[1:38] take thy wives before thine eyes and
[1:40] give them unto thy neighbor and he shall
[1:43] lie with thy wives in the sight of this
[1:46] son
[1:47] for thou didst it secretly
[1:50] so part of the pronouncement here is
[1:52] that god was not pleased that something
[1:54] was done secretly
[1:57] you never do anything secretly god knows
[2:00] all things
[2:01] but as a king now he did something
[2:04] secret did not do it openly but whatever
[2:06] is done secretly if you're a son and
[2:08] daughter of god it will be revealed
[2:10] openly someday
[2:11] for thou this secretly but i will do
[2:14] this thing before all israel and before
[2:16] the son
[2:18] and david said unto nathan i have sinned
[2:20] against the lord and nathan said unto
[2:22] david the lord also hath put away thy
[2:26] sin
[2:28] thou shalt not die now here's where
[2:30] grace comes in
[2:32] aren't you glad when grace comes in
[2:36] because david repented he says i the
[2:38] lord hath put away thy sin david and
[2:41] thou shalt not die he should have died
[2:44] he deserved to die but thou shalt not
[2:47] die how be it because by thy deed thou
[2:49] has given great occasion to the enemies
[2:51] of the lord to blaspheme the child also
[2:54] that is born unto thee shall surely die
[2:57] so bathsheba was pregnant and so then in
[3:00] the next few verses then david starts to
[3:02] appeal to god even though he's been
[3:04] forgiven he starts to appeal to god in
[3:06] fasting and prayer that the child should
[3:08] live that child should live and then you
[3:10] know the story that god says no it would
[3:12] die he pronounced it so we want to get
[3:15] into this this morning and i pray that
[3:17] the lord will give us an anointing and a
[3:19] spirit there's so many blessings and
[3:23] instruction from this
[3:24] but we just want to take it piece by
[3:26] piece and i pray that you'll have an
[3:28] open heart
[3:29] heavenly father bless your word it's
[3:32] already been spoken it's already been
[3:34] done and it will not return void lord it
[3:37] will bring forth a bride in this age in
[3:40] this satan's eden lord we pray you'll
[3:42] bless every heart from different
[3:44] backgrounds and different places
[3:46] even this week maybe they've been
[3:48] through different trials and temptations
[3:50] lord
[3:51] but you have a word for us lord to live
[3:53] by and man shall not live by bread alone
[3:56] but by every word that proceeds from the
[3:58] mouth of god lord may i stand in my
[4:01] office this morning that it's just to
[4:03] simply feed the sheep of god may the
[4:06] hungry ones be fed this morning i pray
[4:09] and i ask it in the name of jesus christ
[4:11] amen and amen god bless you why don't
[4:13] you shake somebody's hand again as
[4:14] you're seated
[4:16] and we appreciate
[4:21] you standing for the word of god
[4:28] i had been referring to
[4:32] the story a few chapters later i had
[4:34] been referring to the story of amnon
[4:37] a little bit in second samuel chapter 13
[4:41] and we know that the story of amnon is a
[4:44] very tragic a very terrible story
[4:47] of rape in the bible
[4:49] and
[4:50] i would say that it's even more terrible
[4:53] that story is even more terrible to see
[4:56] something like this happen in the royal
[4:58] family of israel
[5:00] it's it wouldn't be expected that we
[5:03] would see a story like this
[5:05] in the bible but we we know we would see
[5:08] it maybe in the heathen and in the
[5:10] unbelieving nations but when we have a
[5:12] story like amnon come up amongst the
[5:15] royal family of israel the king of
[5:17] israel that god elected
[5:19] that's kind of unexpected um
[5:22] that this would come out of the very
[5:24] people that are to be upholding the
[5:27] moral laws of god and the commandments
[5:29] of god and the law of moses it's just
[5:32] unexpected
[5:33] and yet yet it happened just the same
[5:38] the bible didn't hide it
[5:40] and thus god did not hide the story
[5:44] god didn't hide the story god left it in
[5:47] his word they recorded it and yet it's
[5:50] here and so if god didn't hide it we
[5:52] don't hide it if god doesn't hide it we
[5:55] don't ignore it and everything god
[5:58] places in this bible is for our
[6:00] instruction for our revelation and for
[6:02] our good if he left something in there
[6:05] then it's to our benefit can you say man
[6:08] although we want to deny it we won't say
[6:10] no that stuff never happens and you know
[6:12] we we want to go those directions and
[6:14] yet god god somehow leaves this in and
[6:18] so when he leaves it in there must be
[6:20] lessons for us in it and so we cannot in
[6:23] this age overlook the mystery of christ
[6:25] and redemption in every part of this
[6:28] bible how many know the prophet of god
[6:31] said that if you don't find christ in
[6:33] every scripture of this bible you need
[6:36] to go back and read it again
[6:38] we as the bride must catch the mystery
[6:40] that's in this bible we must catch the
[6:43] mystery that's in our history can you
[6:45] say amen we must catch the redemption in
[6:48] every scripture because that's what it
[6:50] was written for there's a redemption to
[6:52] god's people can you say amen
[6:54] and so we we see then that that if we
[6:57] miss christ in this then we must go back
[6:59] and read it again ii timothy chapter 3
[7:02] and verse 16 says all scripture is given
[7:06] by inspiration of god how many has read
[7:08] that scripture before all scripture
[7:10] there's not one verse that's left out
[7:13] there's not filler scriptures
[7:15] all scripture is given by inspiration of
[7:19] god and is profitable to us
[7:22] for doctrine for reproof for correction
[7:26] for instruction in righteousness there's
[7:29] not one scripture left out not any
[7:31] scriptures to be ignored everything has
[7:34] value to it can you say amen and god
[7:37] blessed us with the full word of god and
[7:39] not only the full word of god when man
[7:41] tampered with it and put veils over it
[7:44] god in the last day says i'll take all
[7:46] the veils off of that bible and my bride
[7:49] will see it the way she should see it
[7:52] and that's why she'll become a spiritual
[7:54] powerhouse because no devil when you're
[7:56] in the word and the word is in you there
[7:58] isn't any devil can stop that process
[8:02] you're under the power of redemption can
[8:03] you say amen how many raise your head
[8:05] i'm under the power of redemption god
[8:07] has redeemed me and that redemptive
[8:09] power can only go in one direction and
[8:11] that's up can you say about
[8:13] hallelujah
[8:16] so all scripture is to be studied and to
[8:18] be of value if you're not in your bible
[8:20] you should be in your bible
[8:22] you should become familiar with the
[8:24] scriptures
[8:25] see sometimes i read certain parts and
[8:27] it's just so technical keep reading it
[8:30] keep praying with it
[8:32] sometimes i read it and the devil tells
[8:34] me and it is the devil telling you
[8:35] that's not relevant every part of it is
[8:37] relevant relevant somehow can you say
[8:40] amen
[8:41] and and so now
[8:42] we should read it and especially the
[8:44] scriptures that hold the mystery for our
[8:46] day because there's particular
[8:48] scriptures that hold a mystery in them
[8:50] for our time that we live in
[8:53] there's certain scriptures that are very
[8:55] important to the bride because they hold
[8:57] the mystery for our day
[8:59] and david david in the bible coming to
[9:02] his throne
[9:03] finally after so many years under saul
[9:06] and all the transition happening within
[9:07] the message finally david who was the
[9:10] one that was supposed to be god's choice
[9:11] for a king finally david comes to his
[9:14] throne through the help of gentile
[9:17] warriors and that's all a mystery for
[9:19] our day david was placed on the throne
[9:22] through the help of gentile warriors
[9:24] which is a type of the bride of jesus
[9:26] christ gentile warriors that said we
[9:29] believe in you david you're going to be
[9:30] on the throne someday and we're going to
[9:32] fight until we put you on the
[9:34] throne glory be to god
[9:38] but look at the story now look at this
[9:40] in this it had a change of events that
[9:42] we didn't expect david came to his
[9:44] throne through the help of gentile
[9:46] warriors everybody's happy he's on the
[9:49] throne
[9:50] and then
[9:52] all of his enemies were subdued around
[9:54] him
[9:55] he had victory over all of his enemies
[9:57] they were subdued and so you would think
[10:00] that was it it's done it's come to its
[10:02] glory the message has come to its glory
[10:05] but then
[10:06] something started in second samuel
[10:08] chapter 11 and the story takes another
[10:11] turn for the next several chapters the
[10:14] story the glory of him being on the
[10:16] throne the glory of all this coming into
[10:19] place and god sending a prophet and then
[10:21] put a king on the throne and all this
[10:23] seems like it's all ready to go and then
[10:26] the whole story takes a turn when david
[10:28] sins
[10:32] and it's it's a it's a it's a turn of
[10:34] events that was not expected can you say
[10:37] man
[10:39] i'm going to say to you this morning
[10:40] there are some directions and things
[10:42] that the message has went not the
[10:44] message itself but the movement of the
[10:45] message
[10:46] it took turns that we didn't expect can
[10:48] you say amen things have happened that
[10:51] we didn't expect to happen within the
[10:53] message and in our ranks it took a turn
[10:55] and nevertheless always remember this
[10:58] and this is from wednesday night brother
[10:59] gideon and that is no matter what
[11:01] happens god has victory in mind in the
[11:05] end for the bride he's got victory in
[11:07] mind all the time for your life for the
[11:10] bride he's got the victory in mind at
[11:12] the end can i get an amen this morning
[11:15] so brother gideon preached on removing
[11:17] the hindrances and so when in hindrance
[11:19] comes like aiken ache and taking uh two
[11:22] things ache and messed up the ache and
[11:25] stopped the battle of a.i he ruined a
[11:28] battle that they should have won because
[11:30] you know what he did he stole he it was
[11:32] about money and it was about clothes
[11:40] babylonian clothing
[11:43] come on people say amen
[11:45] well how did all of israel start to lose
[11:48] their victory
[11:49] money
[11:51] and clothes from babylon
[11:53] is the thing that brought them down and
[11:56] they couldn't have full victory which is
[11:58] what our brother gideon preached to us
[12:00] god has to remove the hindrances you
[12:02] have to remove the hindrances you got to
[12:05] search it out and find that gold and
[12:07] find those things in your tent and bring
[12:09] them out and they stoned all of akin and
[12:11] his family because why victory is
[12:14] important to god and you can't have full
[12:16] victory when you keep the hindrances in
[12:18] your life i'm not re-preaching gideon's
[12:20] message he preached it good enough but i
[12:22] was so excited to know that god's
[12:24] standing there saying i know israel did
[12:26] this and he didn't say a consent he said
[12:28] all of israel sinned and he says i know
[12:31] this has happened this is little this is
[12:33] a glitch this is it i don't like it i'm
[12:35] angry about this and they can't victory
[12:37] but listen god's saying how can i get
[12:40] this dealt with so i can get the people
[12:43] back to ahai
[12:47] in other words he says oh you blew it so
[12:49] now just try some other cities you won't
[12:51] get a i know he took them right back to
[12:54] ai again when god dealt with the
[12:57] hindrance and the hindrance was gone and
[12:59] the sin was out of the camp he directed
[13:02] them right back you're gonna get the
[13:04] victory over ai
[13:06] that's the same god that i served this
[13:08] morning i don't care what happens in our
[13:11] life i don't care what hindrance is i
[13:13] don't care what pain sorrow
[13:15] mistakes sin can you say man if you're a
[13:18] son and daughter of god
[13:20] god has your victory in mind
[13:23] even when you don't have your victory in
[13:25] mind god's got your victory in mine
[13:31] and they were going to go back to a.i
[13:34] ai
[13:35] artificial intelligence
[13:41] because why that one has got to be
[13:44] conquered
[13:45] anybody waking up this morning this
[13:48] world is full of artificial intelligence
[13:50] we're affected by it but that no devil
[13:53] is going to take the social media and
[13:55] artificial intelligence and we're not
[13:57] going to back down that's something
[13:58] that's got to be conquered in a
[14:00] believer's life oh i can't get enough
[14:02] amens this morning you know it's the
[14:04] truth
[14:05] those cities speak of our victories
[14:08] today
[14:13] hallelujah
[14:16] with the story of david now
[14:18] it takes another turn
[14:20] unexpected and trouble
[14:23] trouble hit
[14:24] the house of david for several chapters
[14:26] as a matter of fact he said you're never
[14:28] going to see the sword depart from your
[14:30] house
[14:31] now
[14:32] i'll get to this at the end
[14:35] if i have enough breath left
[14:38] i'm excited this morning this is an
[14:40] anger this is
[14:42] excitement we have a strange way of
[14:45] expressing it but it's excitement
[14:49] but
[14:50] this is my title this morning
[14:52] accepting troubles
[14:54] but embracing grace
[14:59] because where i want to go with this is
[15:00] sometimes
[15:02] when we make a mistake
[15:05] and god comes in our life and begins to
[15:07] bring
[15:08] because we reap what we saw
[15:11] and he brings the judgments
[15:13] sometimes the judgments we want we want
[15:15] god to affect all of the situation by
[15:18] grace and i can tell you in david's
[15:21] situation he didn't he didn't i should
[15:24] say this in his eyes he didn't give
[15:27] every situation grace but he gave david
[15:30] grace
[15:32] he spared david's life
[15:35] but there were other things that he
[15:36] dealt with the rest of his life
[15:40] and we would say
[15:41] selfishly well that's not my god and
[15:45] god he should be able to get rid of all
[15:47] of this that's our perfect world that we
[15:49] want
[15:50] in a perfect world god should have done
[15:52] this and god should have done that and
[15:53] god and so we bring our own judgments to
[15:55] how god should a judge how much grace he
[15:57] should have gave me let me tell you
[15:59] something i'm preaching my final
[16:00] conclusion here is that we we don't
[16:02] deserve anything from god and any grace
[16:06] that he gives us we don't embrace and
[16:08] say thank god for your grace
[16:10] thank god that i'm still living this
[16:12] morning thank god that i'm still
[16:14] breathing this morning thank god that my
[16:16] family is healthy this morning thank god
[16:18] that i have a desire to serve god thank
[16:21] god that i love this message you think
[16:23] you gave yourself the love for this
[16:25] message in this word you didn't even
[16:27] give that to yourself god created that
[16:29] love within you
[16:32] people say well he didn't give grace in
[16:33] this area he didn't give me this and he
[16:35] didn't give me that and he didn't spare
[16:37] my child why when do we start navigating
[16:40] navigating god's grace we should be
[16:42] grateful
[16:44] for the grace he gives us
[16:46] and when he offers judgment in the rest
[16:48] of the situation we should be thankful
[16:51] for that too
[16:55] but why i don't understand a god like
[16:56] that we don't have to understand all of
[16:58] it
[16:59] why did this happen why did this happen
[17:01] we got some we got some spiritual heroes
[17:03] in this church that it's the grace of
[17:05] god they're sitting here after losing a
[17:07] loved one after losing to either cancer
[17:10] or some other situation it's the grace
[17:12] of god they're even sitting here
[17:13] believing this word anymore because if
[17:15] they went the direction of everybody
[17:17] else their mind would say there's no god
[17:21] but because there's something rooted on
[17:22] the inside that says i'm not going to
[17:24] sit around and try to interpret god i'm
[17:26] going to love him with all my heart and
[17:28] any grace he gives me
[17:30] any unanswered questions
[17:33] blessed be the name of the lord any
[17:35] unanswered questions if i don't get the
[17:37] answers today i'm going to a heaven and
[17:40] i'm going to get all the answers someday
[17:42] every question will be answered and
[17:45] probably most of them you will say oh
[17:48] god thank you that you didn't give me
[17:51] what i was asking for
[17:55] isn't there a song by the isaacs
[17:58] that says something somebody says thank
[17:59] you lord for the things you didn't give
[18:02] me
[18:05] that's maturity
[18:07] thank you lord for the things you didn't
[18:09] give me
[18:10] because when you get to the end of the
[18:12] road you see
[18:13] he's in control
[18:15] he knows the reasons why
[18:18] i just feel like
[18:19] just sitting and crying a while this
[18:22] morning
[18:23] the glory of the lord is filling me so
[18:25] much i don't feel like preaching
[18:26] i just feel like saying thank you lord
[18:30] i don't deserve any of this
[18:33] i don't deserve that my children
[18:36] would love god i don't deserve it could
[18:38] go another direction if it does i pray i
[18:41] have the grace to go through it i don't
[18:42] know
[18:43] but i am so thankful
[18:45] for the grace he's given me
[18:48] lord let me let you know this morning
[18:50] if i've ever was arrogant or proud which
[18:52] i have been and i take things for
[18:54] granted i want to let you know and i'm
[18:56] not doing this for a show this morning
[18:57] i'm telling god
[18:59] forgive me
[19:01] for not being more thankful
[19:03] for your grace
[19:05] because grace is unmerited favor
[19:12] and we might not get all the things we
[19:14] want in life
[19:15] god never promised that
[19:18] he never promised that the cross would
[19:20] not be heavy
[19:23] but if he gives me any of his grace i'll
[19:25] take it i'll embrace it
[19:27] i'm thankful for it
[19:29] and one of the grace that he'll give the
[19:31] bride is rapturing grace
[19:33] to get out of this world
[19:35] because you won't do it by your good
[19:36] works you won't do it by being a better
[19:38] message believer you won't do it by how
[19:40] many quotes you know you won't make this
[19:42] rapture because you're got a a a good
[19:45] attendance record to all the camps
[19:48] it's rapturing grace that will make it
[19:50] to the other side
[19:52] that's why we'll be shouting so much
[19:54] because we know we couldn't have got
[19:56] there
[19:57] except for the grace of god
[20:01] i got to get back up here and preach
[20:03] let's say praise the lord
[20:05] let's rejoice
[20:06] let's give god glory thank you lord for
[20:08] your grace
[20:09] [Applause]
[20:16] hallelujah
[20:18] and so
[20:19] internal trouble trouble in the house of
[20:21] david now
[20:22] because of his sin
[20:24] family trouble
[20:27] sexual sins
[20:29] and many other troubles came to the
[20:31] house of david not just with david's
[20:33] sexual sin but sexual sin became a part
[20:36] of
[20:37] the house of david
[20:39] and i'm not blaming david for that
[20:42] but it has to the commentators and the
[20:44] different ones who write about it
[20:46] they're careful sometimes to attach
[20:48] amnon's sin to david
[20:50] but
[20:51] you can't do that
[20:53] but
[20:54] there's something to be learned
[20:56] about sexual sin
[20:59] that sexual sin no matter how private
[21:02] and undisclosed or it doesn't get out
[21:05] sexual sin has a way
[21:08] of affecting the household
[21:10] down the road
[21:13] and this scripture proves that
[21:15] you don't have to raise your hand say
[21:16] amen to that yes i just want you to chew
[21:18] on it
[21:20] sexual sin in particular has a way of
[21:24] causing
[21:25] residual troubles especially secret
[21:28] sins i can talk of this openly today
[21:32] because i'm not 50 years ago in a
[21:34] generation i'm in 2022
[21:36] and i deal with families that have
[21:38] sexual abuse i deal with families that
[21:41] have been abused uncles and aunts that
[21:43] have molested children at five years old
[21:45] we're not in a we're not in
[21:48] we're not in kansas anymore we're
[21:51] we're not into
[21:53] we're not in 1965.
[21:55] god didn't call me to preach in 1965
[21:59] god called me for such a time as this
[22:01] and if satan can glorify sin and hide
[22:04] sin i can get up in your talk openly
[22:07] respectfully about how sexual sin and
[22:10] pornography can kill a family
[22:16] i'm so mad at the devil
[22:18] that the lord willing
[22:20] i didn't want to announce this today but
[22:21] this winter i'm going to have a night
[22:23] here and i'm inviting any brother who
[22:26] wants to come any brother any brother
[22:28] even from the community and we're going
[22:29] to sit with our bibles and we're going
[22:31] to sit and we're going to study it
[22:33] because to me sons of god do not need to
[22:35] be ignorant of satan's devices in this
[22:37] hour we're going to expose it with the
[22:40] knowledge of god and keep exposing it
[22:43] until we see some sons of god stronger
[22:46] can you say amen by the holy ghost
[22:49] and conscious conscious of what the
[22:52] littlest thing can do to our families
[22:54] when we dabble in it
[22:56] listen friends i got a phone and i get
[22:58] apps and stuff like this like like i
[23:00] told you last sunday i can't wait till i
[23:01] can throw my phone away i hate my phone
[23:04] in the rapture it'll stay here and i'll
[23:06] go there i love it
[23:08] i got a weather app because you know
[23:10] when you get older you're concerned
[23:12] every moment about the weather
[23:17] i don't know why it becomes so important
[23:18] it's just like it helps you function in
[23:20] your day
[23:21] for us old people if it's raining
[23:24] praise the lord i'm staying in bed today
[23:28] praise the lord i don't want to go john
[23:30] and these slack to dudes and go to work
[23:32] all day i don't have to go do it it's
[23:34] raining boys we're not working today
[23:36] it's raining
[23:37] you know i got that app
[23:39] and
[23:40] every
[23:41] there's ads that come underneath the
[23:43] weather app
[23:45] for women's intimates
[23:47] women's underwear the new bikinis that
[23:49] are coming out
[23:50] there's hardly anything else advertised
[23:53] but underneath my weather app what does
[23:56] that have to do
[23:57] with weather
[24:00] well it's it's satan
[24:03] and i'm a son of god
[24:05] and that satan
[24:07] that now takes that
[24:09] uses it
[24:11] so you got i don't even know if there's
[24:13] any tech guys here that can help me take
[24:15] it off i'm sure there's a way but i
[24:17] don't know how to do it i can't stand it
[24:19] it's and you know
[24:22] the temptation is there it can't be
[24:24] wrong just to tap on that thing and just
[24:27] see what's going on
[24:29] my one brother was at communion here and
[24:31] testified that he wanted to buy
[24:32] something for his wife and so he looked
[24:34] in the magazine of jcpenney looking
[24:36] through the the
[24:37] women's stuff and so that's how it
[24:40] started looking for the looking for
[24:41] something for his wife and then all of a
[24:42] sudden now you're looking at everything
[24:44] else
[24:45] it always has a place to start
[24:49] i should have a lot more amens from the
[24:51] sisters right now
[24:55] all right
[24:58] i guess you don't want to sit there and
[25:00] say by your husband
[25:01] amen preach it brother
[25:06] just kick him under the chair or
[25:08] something
[25:15] i don't know i
[25:16] i'm just saying that
[25:18] like
[25:19] like
[25:20] god said to esther mark i said sir
[25:23] could it be that god's raised you up for
[25:25] such a time as this
[25:27] i'm going to put that in my office on a
[25:29] big
[25:29] big sign
[25:31] could it be god's raised you up the
[25:33] ministry for this time not for 1965
[25:36] for such a time as this so if if satan
[25:39] has glorified sexual sin and made it so
[25:42] accessible i'm going to talk about it to
[25:44] you brothers and sisters and you young
[25:46] people openly plainly respectfully but
[25:49] openly play you're going to hear me talk
[25:50] about it because i'm on an all-out
[25:52] attack against the enemy
[26:00] praise god
[26:01] so now
[26:02] years now years of trouble is going to
[26:04] come sexual sins
[26:06] in david's house and he started it now
[26:08] all these things you heard of the
[26:09] heathen nations some of the same
[26:12] incidences happened in their own camp in
[26:15] our own camp
[26:16] for years we heard it in the heathens
[26:18] but now we hear it in our own camp we
[26:20] hear it david it's in it's in the royal
[26:22] family many years of trouble in david's
[26:25] house came from it
[26:27] so i don't want the story to end there
[26:28] i'm just going to quickly say and go
[26:30] back to david here but i'm going to
[26:31] quickly say to you in the story it ends
[26:34] in a victory because many years after a
[26:36] lot of trouble in david's house
[26:38] if it's a type of the bride today and i
[26:40] believe it is then praise the lord jesus
[26:43] that wasn't the end because the next
[26:45] generation raised up under solomon
[26:47] restoration came a temple was built and
[26:50] guess what god came down and responded
[26:52] back and filled the temple so much with
[26:55] his glory that the minister couldn't
[26:57] even speak
[26:59] i'm telling you people being defeated
[27:01] people under a cloud people underneath
[27:04] uh
[27:05] habits and things
[27:06] god is going to deliver this bride from
[27:08] every one of them and god's got your
[27:10] victory in mind can you say amen and
[27:12] this bride god's going to fill his
[27:14] temples with his glory at the end of
[27:16] this thing and take him in a rapture
[27:22] that's how the story ends
[27:24] is it ended in the glory of god coming
[27:26] down in the temple i don't care how much
[27:28] troubles david's house has solomon
[27:30] raised up
[27:33] and then our prophet proclaims
[27:35] a greater than solomon is here
[27:39] somebody say praise the lord
[27:41] a greater than solomon he was
[27:43] proclaiming
[27:45] don't worry about your troubles don't
[27:46] worry about being in satan's eden a
[27:48] greater than solomon is here now
[27:51] and that means god's going to fill his
[27:53] temples with the glory of god
[27:56] praise the lord god's going to send
[27:58] revival again how many believe revival
[28:01] it's not a national revival but it's the
[28:03] bride's revival can you say amen
[28:05] amen after all that happened and they
[28:07] didn't deserve the glory of god come
[28:09] they didn't deserve all after all the
[28:11] sexual sin they didn't deserve the glory
[28:13] of god coming down in solomon's day they
[28:15] didn't deserve it none of us deserve any
[28:16] of it but god has victory in mind for
[28:19] his people and he will come and we know
[28:22] that the people will reap some bad
[28:24] harvest because of decisions they make
[28:26] but how
[28:27] god says they're reaping because i have
[28:30] a law of sowing and reaping god says in
[28:33] my people today they're reaping
[28:36] there's a law of harvest they're reaping
[28:37] a harvest from bad decisions that they
[28:40] made but god doesn't stay there he says
[28:43] i know they're reaping a harvest but how
[28:46] can i get them to a final victory
[28:51] i love it
[28:53] now
[28:55] and there's some pretty difficult things
[28:57] that happen sometimes within our ranks
[29:00] more things that i would probably like
[29:02] to see
[29:04] troubles internally
[29:06] but god somebody sang a song in the
[29:08] night of worship called god gets the
[29:09] final say
[29:12] in your trials in your mistakes
[29:15] god gets the final saying
[29:17] and i would rather hem him have the
[29:19] final say in my life
[29:22] god will get the final say but anyone
[29:24] who says we ignore certain stories uh we
[29:27] don't preach on those certain stories
[29:29] that when the people of god were in
[29:30] trouble or uh
[29:32] that happens in the ranks of god we're
[29:34] we're gonna ignore that that's going on
[29:36] the that story doesn't apply to us the
[29:38] bride we're the bride
[29:41] those stories don't apply to us
[29:43] well that's a message pride
[29:51] i say it's a message pride to ignore
[29:54] certain things and say that never
[29:55] happens among us
[29:58] the same devil that came in the house of
[30:01] david
[30:02] is working against us today
[30:06] so let's quit pretending
[30:10] let's quit pretending
[30:13] and let's be filled with the spirit
[30:16] and go against this enemy
[30:19] individually and collectively let's
[30:21] stand full of the holy ghost and go
[30:23] against this enemy
[30:25] that's what i say can you say amen
[30:28] so
[30:28] you can be in denial and you can cover
[30:31] up but we learn
[30:33] all this from the bible we learn from
[30:35] all the bible we learn from the whole
[30:36] story of david's trouble and i will call
[30:39] this david's sin the kind of the back
[30:41] story of amnon and the back story is
[30:44] events that led up to amnon events that
[30:46] led up and so we know as i've been
[30:49] speaking about amnon there's several
[30:50] reasons that he got where he was at that
[30:52] he could become so possessed of the
[30:54] enemy
[30:55] so possessed of devils and lustful
[30:57] demons that he actually uh
[31:00] raped a girl
[31:02] and took him in the bible now
[31:05] it's it's amazing and so there's several
[31:06] reasons he got there i spoke about the
[31:08] mind
[31:09] a mind his mind must have been turned
[31:12] over to
[31:13] other thoughts so much he couldn't have
[31:15] got there amnon couldn't have got there
[31:18] with his mind being completely uh
[31:20] controlled by another spirit
[31:22] and then there's another message i want
[31:24] to get into lord willing he the next
[31:26] scripture in ammon says he had a friend
[31:28] amnon had a friend it was a bad friend
[31:30] it was a bad friend so he had the wrong
[31:33] friend if you have the wrong friend it's
[31:35] going to influence your life i don't
[31:37] know why we even call some people
[31:39] friends when they keep weakening us
[31:41] spiritually that's not your friends your
[31:43] friends are the ones that draw you
[31:45] closer to god
[31:47] i got this online friend and oh we have
[31:49] a nice relationship and they're a
[31:51] complete unbeliever that's really not
[31:53] your friend it might be your enemy
[31:57] but admin had a friend and that's how he
[31:59] got there too
[32:00] so all the events leading up to it but
[32:02] there's several reasons that amnon got
[32:04] there but you see now but the one i want
[32:07] to talk about today is the king's sin
[32:10] because we might not say it's not say
[32:12] it's not related but the dad the king
[32:16] what david did
[32:18] what david did and you can disagree with
[32:20] me that's fine but i believe what david
[32:22] did
[32:23] set a tone
[32:25] in the family and in the kingdom
[32:28] because nobody knew about this before
[32:30] and now god says i'm going to blast it
[32:31] all over that our king that our king
[32:33] took a woman that wasn't his and had
[32:36] sexual relations with her and then
[32:38] killed the husband all of this word got
[32:40] out and so if you don't think that has
[32:41] an effect on people's minds
[32:44] our king our god called king our man
[32:47] that's in leadership our leader
[32:51] you see we think it's the sin is bad and
[32:53] the sin is terrible it was terrible but
[32:55] what satan does with the sin
[32:57] is sometimes worth because it's a lack
[33:00] of trust in the people again
[33:02] and not only that if it's not dealt with
[33:05] then we realize it sets a precedence
[33:07] kind of like with esther and the king
[33:09] and the the king said go tell vashtai to
[33:13] did i want her to come and do something
[33:14] in the banquet and bashed i said no i
[33:17] refuse to come and so now the king says
[33:20] if we let that go and all the rulers
[33:22] said if we let that go then all the
[33:24] women of the land are going to say
[33:27] say no to their husbands when they ask
[33:29] them to do something when they ask for a
[33:31] sandwich and all the women are saying no
[33:36] it it has a trickle-down effect
[33:42] fathers husbands young men
[33:45] listen to me today
[33:47] sometimes your little decisions
[33:50] can have a trickle-down effect
[33:54] to children for many generations now
[33:57] listen i believe god has the power to
[34:00] break curses in families
[34:03] and i could preach another sermon on
[34:04] that and you'd probably be more excited
[34:06] about it than what i'm preaching today
[34:09] but god can break curses in families
[34:12] but i can still preach if that curse
[34:14] isn't broke then little decisions that
[34:17] david made and different ones make you
[34:19] think you can do it privately but it's
[34:21] going to have an effect
[34:23] it's going to trickle down
[34:25] it will spill over and then you look at
[34:27] your sons and daughters sometimes you
[34:29] say why are they that way well you don't
[34:32] just say well it's because they don't
[34:33] have the holy ghost it's all on them
[34:35] it's not always on all of them it's poor
[34:38] decisions that we made
[34:41] and trust me friends you don't have to
[34:42] say amended with all this as long as you
[34:44] chew on it that's fine it's nice to get
[34:46] amens but i know these subjects are
[34:48] tedious to talk about i'm not wanting to
[34:50] bring you brothers down or your sisters
[34:52] down but i want to speak openly and
[34:54] honestly that we life is life and when
[34:57] you make decisions privately sometimes
[34:59] sexual
[35:00] temptation decisions and you fall and
[35:02] you do things like that you think you're
[35:04] hiding it but it has a trickle-down
[35:06] effect in sexual things in the family
[35:11] i'm not wanting you to take all the
[35:12] blame
[35:14] but i want you to do what david did and
[35:16] he took the blame and brought it to god
[35:19] and god forgave him
[35:20] but he had trouble in his house
[35:24] because of it
[35:27] so
[35:30] david set the tone for the family a
[35:32] little bit here
[35:34] sexual sin and passions
[35:39] sexual sin and passions for those things
[35:44] with david
[35:45] we're lifted way too high
[35:48] in importance
[35:52] i'm going to read a quote from the
[35:54] prophet in a minute that will show
[35:57] brother ram speaks of his pace his
[35:59] passions
[36:00] and his passions david's passions
[36:03] were all of a sudden placed more
[36:06] important
[36:08] than his family the kingdom
[36:12] at a moment's time
[36:14] he placed his sexual temptation and his
[36:17] passions the most important thing in
[36:20] that private moment
[36:23] and i'm here to say when the devil in
[36:25] satan's eden starts to get us doing that
[36:28] it's only destruction coming from it
[36:32] you see that's the thing is that god
[36:34] made us the way we are i tell young
[36:36] people this
[36:38] you shouldn't feel
[36:40] that you've sinned because you have an
[36:42] attraction to the opposite sex
[36:45] god gave you that
[36:47] it's normal it's natural
[36:49] in the message thirst brother abraham
[36:51] said it's normal for us to want to
[36:52] fellowship with a mate and have
[36:54] fellowship and to be married and things
[36:56] like this god gave you a natural thirst
[36:59] within you to be married and all those
[37:01] things he puts within our body to
[37:04] fulfill our fulfill ourselves with
[37:06] another person with the right person
[37:08] after we're married it's all natural
[37:09] there's no sin in that
[37:11] the marriage bed is undefiled
[37:16] and maybe because satan knows that
[37:17] scripture because how many knows he
[37:19] knows the scripture too maybe because he
[37:21] knows the scripture and i'm going to
[37:22] teach it as a pastor and our youth
[37:24] leaders are going to teach it and
[37:25] everybody's going to teach it he knows
[37:26] that the marriage is undefiled so satan
[37:28] says well then i need to defile their
[37:31] minds and defile them before they would
[37:33] get married
[37:35] that they even hardly can have a natural
[37:37] normal marriage because their mind's
[37:38] been so defiled by porganography and
[37:41] romantic books
[37:42] their minds have been messed with satan
[37:44] does that can you say amen to take the
[37:46] purity and innocence of a young child
[37:49] even at five years old teaching about
[37:51] lesbians in our public school system god
[37:54] have mercy on this nation what are we
[37:56] doing to our children
[37:59] never should see things you should never
[38:00] see it at 16 years old
[38:03] you should keep your life under the
[38:04] grace of god god i'll
[38:06] help me to preserve my mind my not my
[38:09] mind is not a garbage can help me to not
[38:11] look help me to turn my head and keep
[38:13] myself from my wife or my husband as
[38:15] best i can lord when i make a mistake
[38:17] god forgive me never let me look at that
[38:20] again because you blessed the marriage
[38:22] bed undefiled there's no sin in that and
[38:26] there's no sin that you have an
[38:27] attraction to the opposite sex you get
[38:29] about 12 11 12 13 years old and you
[38:32] start thinking about them when you were
[38:33] eight years old guys never think of
[38:35] girls they don't need girls girls are
[38:37] not necessary
[38:39] they wish it was a whole earth full of
[38:41] guys not girls we don't need them
[38:45] and then their bodies change and at 13
[38:48] they become aware of the opposite sex
[38:50] and they and then you ask them do we
[38:52] need girls yeah we need girls
[38:56] everything changes what happened to you
[38:59] even the voice changes
[39:01] dad
[39:04] your whole body changes
[39:06] and now
[39:07] and everything about that every young
[39:10] people you listen
[39:11] everything about that change in your
[39:12] body is not sin
[39:16] it's normal
[39:20] and god says i know about that i know
[39:22] and i'm going to bless them with a a
[39:24] godly husband and wife someday and
[39:26] they'll be able to according first
[39:27] corinthians 7 have their own wife and
[39:29] they'll be able to fulfill that sexual
[39:31] desire so if you'll give yourself to my
[39:33] word i'll prepare a husband for you and
[39:36] you can fulfill that properly instead of
[39:39] cheapening it
[39:40] like the world does
[39:42] instead of playing around with it on
[39:43] your own in the backseat of a car
[39:49] you got yourself out of the will of god
[39:56] trying to think of
[39:58] the thought that i was bringing up just
[39:59] now
[40:01] god
[40:02] gave you these things naturally so in
[40:04] romans 1 a couple weeks ago romans 1
[40:07] all of a sudden when they begin to turn
[40:08] to sin then all of a sudden this thing
[40:10] came in
[40:11] that was beyond natural affection
[40:14] and women turned in lust towards one
[40:16] another and men that's the final result
[40:19] of sexual things not being put under the
[40:22] holy ghost
[40:24] that's the fun and we're there we are
[40:26] there we are at the full manifestation
[40:28] of sodom and gomorrah where there's not
[40:31] too much time left we're there we're
[40:33] living in sodom can you say amen
[40:36] that's why i said a few weeks ago when i
[40:37] talked about what the ladies should wear
[40:38] why in the world are you bucking up
[40:40] against something when god gave us those
[40:42] things because of this sodom spirit he
[40:45] gave you sisters what to wear and what
[40:46] was modest
[40:49] to counter the sodom spirit coming to
[40:51] your children
[40:55] but normal natural desires get changed
[40:58] can you say amen
[40:59] and david
[41:01] david kind of started this because
[41:05] the
[41:06] natural things and sexual sins and
[41:08] passions for those things were lifted
[41:10] way too of importance
[41:14] so i'm going to expose some things here
[41:16] this morning that were the beginning of
[41:18] david's trouble you speed ahead three
[41:21] chapters
[41:22] and you got a young boy in his kingdom
[41:24] his his son one of his sons
[41:28] so possessed
[41:29] that he would rape his own half-sister
[41:34] how do you get there
[41:36] it's when your passions and your sexual
[41:39] temptations get lifted above
[41:41] family
[41:43] get lifted above everything else
[41:45] sometimes an addiction is lifted above
[41:47] eating because it is an addiction it's
[41:49] lifted above everything and that night
[41:51] that's what david did you may not want
[41:52] me to hear king david talked about like
[41:54] this that's exactly what happened that
[41:56] night here's a man who stood in the
[41:59] palaces of god as king
[42:01] and gave himself over
[42:03] to a private secret thought that said no
[42:07] one will find out and he lifted the
[42:10] passions he felt
[42:12] so high
[42:14] that he did not think about family he
[42:16] didn't think of the repercussions
[42:18] he didn't know
[42:19] tamar was i think 13 years old
[42:23] he had no idea that his decision could
[42:26] affect tamar just a few years later
[42:30] i'll tell you brothers we better be
[42:31] conscious of the decisions we make
[42:36] it's not just going to affect you it's
[42:38] going to affect your wife
[42:40] it's going to affect your family
[42:44] brother paul why don't you be bold
[42:47] quit beating around the bush
[42:51] i say that sarcastically
[42:54] why don't you just come right out and
[42:55] say it well i'm gonna come right out and
[42:56] say it
[43:00] two things in our satan's eden things
[43:03] done in secret while we're relaxing
[43:07] and unnatural passions and affections
[43:09] those two things are the things that we
[43:11] fight against
[43:12] more than anything else
[43:14] both are big traps in the time we live
[43:16] in but even worse
[43:18] you can have unnatural passions lifted
[43:21] up above important things in life you
[43:23] can have things done secretly while
[43:25] you're relaxing but they're worse today
[43:27] because these two things are magnified
[43:31] and fueled in other words the gas is
[43:33] poured on them a hundred times by media
[43:36] and by the devices that we have so you
[43:39] may have the problem that you lift up
[43:41] sexual temptation and you lift up your
[43:44] passions high above every other normal
[43:46] thing in life you might start to get
[43:48] unnatural affections and and start to
[43:50] believe in ideas you might lift it up
[43:52] but now if you feed on any of things of
[43:55] the devices of this age it multiplies it
[43:57] by a hundred times
[44:00] no wonder we have this problem
[44:03] because you could have 200 years ago a
[44:06] boy that has a problem it was very rare
[44:08] but he has a problem with the spirit of
[44:09] homosexuality you have a problem with
[44:11] someone raping somebody or something
[44:13] like that 200 years ago but you didn't
[44:14] have the social media and you didn't
[44:16] have the
[44:17] the sex saturated media that we have
[44:20] today so you take a spirit of lust and
[44:23] put it and you're going to feed on that
[44:25] stuff too i'll tell you without the holy
[44:27] ghost your chances are overcoming almost
[44:30] nothing in this hour
[44:33] i'm trying to make you awake to it that
[44:35] we have to realize that if we didn't
[44:37] have the fourth dimension
[44:40] so easily accessible in our hands it
[44:42] would not be as bad but we do have the
[44:44] fourth dimension brought to us in the
[44:46] last hundred years more than we've ever
[44:48] had and the fifth dimension you got to
[44:50] realize that now the fourth dimension
[44:53] how many would agree until tv came out
[44:55] it wasn't until this last generation
[44:57] that the fourth it was always there but
[44:59] now we have the fourth dimension brought
[45:01] into a tube brought into whatever it is
[45:03] brought into our phones satan in the
[45:05] last days used technology to bring the
[45:07] fourth dimension so we can see it
[45:10] that's your generation
[45:13] now on your phone you can see anything
[45:15] so now as i said whenever it was in the
[45:17] last few services is that now satan says
[45:19] from the fifth dimension of demonic
[45:21] realms he takes the fifth dimension and
[45:23] it spills over into the fourth dimension
[45:25] of television then if we feed on it that
[45:28] all those demons spill over from the
[45:30] fourth dimension into the first three
[45:32] dimensions that we live on
[45:34] and mostly it fills your mind
[45:40] i'm not getting satan compliments but he
[45:42] certainly knows what he's doing
[45:45] and he's smarter than some believers
[45:47] i'm so glad this isn't based upon smarts
[45:51] because i couldn't go up against the
[45:52] devil but it is based upon a revelation
[45:54] the lord gives the bride
[45:57] when that drops in your heart some of
[45:58] the things this morning if it would drop
[46:00] in your heart by revelation i'll tell
[46:01] you it'll affect your life and say i'm
[46:03] not a statistic i'm not to fall like the
[46:05] rest of the world i'm a daughter of god
[46:07] i'm a son of god i'm 16 years old and
[46:10] i'm not going to feed on that trash
[46:12] i'm gonna stand as a son of god when i
[46:15] make a mistake i'm gonna ask god's
[46:17] forgiveness and i'm gonna stand against
[46:18] this
[46:20] god give us men and girls and women
[46:23] that'll stand with the truth in this
[46:25] hour
[46:28] full of the holy ghost
[46:30] if it didn't now so now
[46:32] i've got to move on here
[46:34] so our world
[46:36] is fashioned
[46:37] to two things our world and our social
[46:39] media and our television it's fashion
[46:43] you say well i don't watch any
[46:44] television i don't watch i don't watch
[46:46] that stuff on my phone well you better
[46:48] keep your eyes off the billboards
[46:51] there's not anywhere you can go without
[46:52] it
[46:53] look at what people are wearing at
[46:54] walmart
[46:57] in the checkout line
[46:59] so i never watch all that stuff well you
[47:02] better turn your head in walmart
[47:04] it's very interesting outfits in walmart
[47:07] i don't know why that is
[47:11] interesting people
[47:15] this is a statement i wanted to make
[47:17] our world right now is fashion
[47:21] to teach us to hide sin
[47:25] and it also exploits sexual lust
[47:28] that's the world you live in
[47:30] it's not just sexual lust is there and
[47:32] you heightened people did that before
[47:33] david did it but now it's heightened in
[47:36] its fashion
[47:37] to increase and pour
[47:40] gas on a fire because
[47:42] sexual passions is a fire in the book of
[47:45] proverbs how many knows it's a fire
[47:48] can a man touch fire and not be burnt
[47:50] and he's talking about the strange woman
[47:52] he's talking about prostitutes he's
[47:54] talking about looking at the wrong woman
[47:55] and he says can a man touch bring fire
[47:58] into his bosom which is a reference to
[48:00] by the way to sex
[48:03] can a man bring fire and not be burnt by
[48:06] it
[48:07] no
[48:09] we learned that lesson when we were two
[48:10] years old i thought
[48:12] if you touch fire you get burnt
[48:18] now a controlled fire
[48:20] is a wonderful thing
[48:22] in marriage
[48:26] a controlled fire this fall when we have
[48:28] a bonfire and have the young people over
[48:30] and it's controlled and not burning down
[48:32] my woods
[48:34] it's a beautiful thing you got that you
[48:36] got you got your sweatshirt on
[48:38] you got the s'mores going the chocolate
[48:40] the hershey chocolate with the
[48:42] marshmallow i like to burn them quite a
[48:45] bit
[48:46] you stuff that on a graham cracker you
[48:48] put that together
[48:50] it's just it's and it's all done by a
[48:52] controlled fire controlled fires a
[48:54] fireplace sitting by a fireplace in your
[48:56] house it's relaxing it's peaceful
[48:58] there's nothing wrong with the fire
[49:01] it's just when it gets out of control
[49:06] there's nothing wrong with your passions
[49:07] it's just when they're put in the wrong
[49:09] place
[49:12] a fire a fire uncontrolled can destroy
[49:16] everything precious to you you do know
[49:19] that right
[49:20] if if your home catches something and
[49:22] you don't catch it it'll destroy
[49:24] everything precious to you
[49:26] and i'm saying that today that sexual
[49:30] sin and temptation that's not put under
[49:32] the control of the holy ghost will
[49:35] eventually destroy your entire life
[49:39] take your family away from
[49:44] i get a greater amen this morning
[49:46] it's not easy to talk about these things
[49:48] but i give the glory to god
[49:51] and the outcome to god
[49:52] you know what i want to see i want to
[49:54] see young men rise young husbands rise
[49:56] to the occasion you know i'd like to see
[49:59] it's no service if there's no repentance
[50:01] i'd like to see young people go home and
[50:04] take the trash off their phones i'd like
[50:06] to see fathers that are privately
[50:09] sitting repent to their wives and say
[50:11] hun i've got to confess something to you
[50:13] i'd like to see more confession i'll
[50:15] tell you if we have confession in
[50:17] bringing it on the table no matter what
[50:19] the outcome bring it on the table i'd
[50:21] love to see that it doesn't have to be
[50:22] in this service but i pray it would be
[50:24] because if we have that kind of
[50:25] confession we've got the devil on the
[50:27] run and victory is on the way
[50:34] that's what burns me is we have all
[50:36] these great services and wonder woman
[50:37] shout and dance and i i'm for every bit
[50:39] of it but listen if there's no substance
[50:42] to that if there's no repentance if
[50:44] there's no change in our lives it
[50:46] doesn't mean anything we need repentance
[50:48] to say god i'm wrong you're right set me
[50:51] on the right track lord
[50:56] so all this fourth dimension has moved
[50:58] us into a mindset and lifestyle hiding
[51:00] private worlds
[51:01] and heightened emphasis
[51:03] on sex excuse me older ones if if i just
[51:07] say that too
[51:08] blatantly i know 60 years ago we used
[51:11] the term family relations brother
[51:12] branham used that
[51:13] but they hear this term all the time
[51:18] this generation moves us into a mindset
[51:20] and lifestyle to hide in our private
[51:22] worlds
[51:25] and also to heighten the emphasis
[51:28] on sex
[51:29] unnatural and normal
[51:31] taking something that's a normal part of
[51:33] life a normal part of our bodies but
[51:36] making it everything our world is
[51:38] fashioned to hide sin and to exploit
[51:40] sexual lust and that's not good
[51:43] and the house begins to be
[51:46] invaded
[51:47] by the enemy if we open the doors to
[51:50] this
[51:50] can i get an amen
[51:53] even girls today
[51:55] privately looking at things that they
[51:56] shouldn't look at used to be more guys
[51:58] but girls are doing it
[52:02] i can't come into your home young girls
[52:05] and look at what you're doing look at
[52:06] what you're watching
[52:08] i can't do that some of you are too old
[52:09] for me to do that i wouldn't want to do
[52:11] that anyway because i don't want to be
[52:12] your holy ghost
[52:14] i'm not here to be your holy ghost i'm
[52:16] here to guide you and say that thing's
[52:18] going to destroy your life it's going to
[52:20] destroy your mind
[52:23] our house the last few months has been
[52:25] invaded by moths
[52:28] is that the way you say it moths moth a
[52:30] moth hundreds thousands of them coming
[52:33] out
[52:35] and they just are everywhere and we're
[52:38] asking in
[52:39] but the thing is they're they're
[52:40] breeding somewhere but they're breeding
[52:43] in secret
[52:45] they're hiding
[52:46] we don't know where they're breeding do
[52:48] we get in we have looked we have climbed
[52:50] places and we do not know where these
[52:52] moths are bringing but they're
[52:54] irritating but i've realized through
[52:56] this sermon this morning those little
[52:58] nasty things are doing this in private
[53:05] and when you can't find where they're
[53:07] privately breeding
[53:09] you're going to keep having a problem of
[53:11] them buzzing around your house that's
[53:12] what we deal with is buzzing buzzing
[53:15] around the house and so if you come into
[53:17] my house you're often going to see me
[53:18] going
[53:22] i did it in front of solomon the other
[53:24] night he thought i was praising him for
[53:26] something he did
[53:27] he said i was clapping for him
[53:31] i guess you don't get enough praise
[53:35] [Laughter]
[53:42] and and we can do that for a week and we
[53:44] still have them coming out in droves
[53:46] thousands of them if anybody can help us
[53:48] matter of fact me saying that we're
[53:49] going to get help when i talked about
[53:51] crab grass a few weeks ago i got
[53:53] response how to deal with my crab grass
[53:55] what mixture to put in i say praise the
[53:57] lord thank you for the help now i'm
[53:58] going to get all kinds of things how to
[53:59] deal with moths in the house
[54:02] tell you me and my wife we need all the
[54:04] help we can get
[54:06] we might have to move out the moth take
[54:07] over
[54:08] but it's all happening here's my point
[54:11] where nobody sees it's in the dark
[54:20] turn turn let's see where this starts
[54:22] second samuel 11
[54:25] and it came to pass
[54:27] after the year
[54:31] was expired at the time when kings go
[54:34] forth to battle
[54:36] that david sent joab and his servants
[54:40] with him
[54:41] and all israel
[54:43] and they destroyed the children of ammon
[54:46] and besieged reba
[54:48] but david tarried still at jerusalem
[54:54] now we have
[54:57] this the whole household is of david's
[55:00] going to be affected the sword would
[55:02] never
[55:03] depart from his house
[55:05] family killing family members
[55:09] and this is where it all starts
[55:11] to preach another hour just on this and
[55:13] preachers have
[55:15] when kings
[55:16] are supposed to be engaging in battle
[55:20] they choose to let everybody else battle
[55:23] and they take a vacation
[55:30] and they stay home privately to relax i
[55:33] fought every year david was a warrior he
[55:35] knew how to fight he knew how to battle
[55:38] but the one one year he decided when
[55:40] it's time it's time to go it's like we
[55:42] don't know why he decided but he decided
[55:44] you guys you go this year i'm gonna
[55:47] relax i'm gonna take a little break from
[55:49] all this and it says to all of us
[55:52] friends that in the hour we live in
[55:54] especially every christian
[55:57] boy girl whoever you are
[55:59] we are never
[56:01] ever to take a break from this battle
[56:07] there are no vacations
[56:10] from this battle
[56:12] you say well i'm going on vacation to
[56:14] florida don't take a vacation from god
[56:17] don't take a vacation from the devil
[56:18] you'll probably fight hunter down there
[56:21] i'm taking a vacation from wearing
[56:23] anything modest i'm going to florida
[56:24] don't take a vacation from what you
[56:26] believe
[56:27] [Applause]
[56:29] there are no vacations to a christian
[56:32] every day we must be engaged in this
[56:34] battle and it's a battle of the mind and
[56:36] if we don't stay engaged in this battle
[56:39] the satan will take advantage of us can
[56:42] you say amen david decided for some
[56:44] reason i'm staying home this year i just
[56:47] need to relax i got me a new hot tub
[56:49] i've got my stuff set up here and i this
[56:52] is great i got a i've got a a a a deck
[56:55] out here built and i got a patio and i'm
[56:57] going out and so he's there all of the
[56:59] men are fighting all the other believers
[57:01] around the world are fighting in the
[57:03] battle and he decides to stay back with
[57:05] his computer
[57:10] so he's on his computer
[57:12] and nobody's around he sends his
[57:14] servants away nobody's around so he
[57:16] reads and then with all that in his mind
[57:18] all of a sudden now he's i'm just
[57:19] relaxing i'm just relaxing walks out on
[57:22] his new patio on his new deck this is
[57:24] nice this is composite this is the new
[57:26] stuff that'll last forever
[57:31] everybody's gone and he and so now he
[57:34] he looks over
[57:36] and bathsheba is taking a bath
[57:39] on the other deck
[57:42] in a moment's time
[57:44] he doesn't think about family
[57:46] he's not thinking of tamar
[57:49] he's not thinking of his position he's
[57:51] not thinking of the blessing of the lord
[57:53] he's not thinking of how good he has it
[57:57] he's not thinking that the lord said
[57:59] i'll fight your battle so when he went
[58:00] and fought battles and destroyed the
[58:02] enemy it really wasn't david's power it
[58:04] was god's power and he's ready in a
[58:06] moment's time to jeopardize all of that
[58:09] anointing in battle
[58:12] for his passions
[58:14] so now i don't have to tell the rest
[58:16] story you know how it is she's she's not
[58:18] she's scantily dressed if not we're not
[58:20] wearing anything
[58:21] and
[58:22] the prophet said she's just as guilty as
[58:24] david was
[58:26] she shouldn't have been out doing that
[58:31] takes her
[58:33] then she gets pregnant then he tries to
[58:36] hide it
[58:38] then he has her husband killed what was
[58:41] his name
[58:42] uriah
[58:44] and
[58:46] brother rem says when i get to the other
[58:48] side
[58:49] there's one fella i want to shake his
[58:50] hand
[58:52] it wasn't david
[58:56] i want to shake david's hand too
[58:58] he said i want to shake brother uriah's
[59:00] hand a gentile warrior
[59:02] who fought
[59:03] that was not fair
[59:05] what happened to him
[59:09] but if brother branham says he's gonna
[59:10] be on the other side
[59:12] i don't care if things happen in life
[59:14] that are unfair to us
[59:17] god's going to correct it all on the
[59:18] other side
[59:21] and i believe that man will be rewarded
[59:24] big time
[59:26] by another believer's mistake
[59:28] by another believer's passions out of
[59:30] control it affected uriah and said i'd
[59:32] like to shake his hand saying god bless
[59:35] you brother
[59:36] he was a hero in brother branham's eyes
[59:40] verse two that's only verse one but he
[59:42] took a break relaxed what time is it
[59:44] here
[59:48] and it came to pass
[59:50] in the evening tide
[59:53] you notice it wasn't in
[59:56] the morning or the afternoon
[59:58] it was in the dark
[1:00:00] it was in the evening if you don't think
[1:00:02] that says something about today
[1:00:05] that most and even the prophet referred
[1:00:07] to demon power coming out
[1:00:09] in the evenings creatures like spiders
[1:00:12] and all these things come out they
[1:00:14] thrive on darkness
[1:00:17] that's why i appreciate the song this
[1:00:19] morning
[1:00:20] because we're living in darkness but god
[1:00:22] has sent us the light can you say man
[1:00:24] i'm preaching light to you this
[1:00:26] morning we have deliverance from
[1:00:28] darkness
[1:00:31] but it's the evening that most of this
[1:00:34] dabbling on the computer takes place
[1:00:37] it's private it's in the evening evening
[1:00:39] time david rose office bed and walked
[1:00:42] upon the roof of the king's house and
[1:00:44] from the roof he saw a woman washing
[1:00:45] herself and the woman was very beautiful
[1:00:47] and it was very beautiful to look upon
[1:00:50] it's amazing now all of a sudden
[1:00:52] everything gets trashed
[1:00:54] and then so you you know the story
[1:00:58] most preachers preach on that but now
[1:01:01] now
[1:01:02] in chapter 12
[1:01:05] is where grace steps in
[1:01:07] god sends him a prophet he tells a story
[1:01:09] about the the little
[1:01:12] uh if you go to chapter 12 i won't read
[1:01:14] the whole thing
[1:01:15] but he gives them a parable the rich man
[1:01:17] and exceeding many flocks and herds he
[1:01:19] had a rich man verse three but the poor
[1:01:20] man had nothing saved one little you
[1:01:22] lamb which he had brought and nourished
[1:01:24] up and grew it up together with him and
[1:01:26] with his children it did eat of his own
[1:01:27] meat and drank his own cup and laying
[1:01:29] his bosom and was unto him as a daughter
[1:01:31] and there came a traveler unto the rich
[1:01:32] man and he spare
[1:01:34] to take of his own flock in his own herd
[1:01:36] to dress for the wafering man that was
[1:01:37] come unto him but took the poor man's
[1:01:39] lamb dressed it for the man that was
[1:01:41] come to him and david's anger was
[1:01:44] greatly kindled against the man
[1:01:47] and he said to nathan as the lord liveth
[1:01:49] the man that hath done this thing shall
[1:01:51] surely die
[1:01:53] the bread says he pronounced his own
[1:01:55] judgment
[1:01:59] so i'd like to make a comment about
[1:02:01] anger
[1:02:03] sometimes
[1:02:05] anger is innocent we get angry at things
[1:02:08] anger is an emotion within us
[1:02:10] it's it's not that you have anger that
[1:02:12] it's but it's what you do with your
[1:02:14] anger i know none of you have ever you
[1:02:17] hardly ever get angry
[1:02:19] but
[1:02:20] this anger to me is tied
[1:02:23] to condemnation
[1:02:26] and to the sexual sin that he did
[1:02:28] because in my short 35 years of
[1:02:31] pastoring
[1:02:32] in my short years i have watched some
[1:02:35] man that's bound by sexual addiction
[1:02:40] become more angry
[1:02:42] become more defensive when he's
[1:02:44] corrected
[1:02:46] he becomes more prideful
[1:02:49] and
[1:02:53] he becomes more critical of other
[1:02:55] people's sins
[1:02:59] i'm just telling you that's what i've
[1:03:00] learned
[1:03:01] the characteristics of anger and
[1:03:03] defensiveness and pride and being very
[1:03:06] critical of others pops up when
[1:03:09] someone's hiding sexual sin sometimes
[1:03:12] they become a legalist and they're
[1:03:14] requiring the law by everybody else
[1:03:17] it's because they're hiding something
[1:03:21] and they're the harshest at somebody
[1:03:23] else's sexual sin
[1:03:27] isn't that
[1:03:28] amazing so he's angry
[1:03:31] he's defensive he's and he's pride and
[1:03:34] he's being critical of others related to
[1:03:36] someone's sinning so this guy this guy
[1:03:38] took the other ewe lamb and he shouldn't
[1:03:40] have done that and so now david's
[1:03:42] pointing out this is wrong this is wrong
[1:03:45] for people to do and he's critical of
[1:03:46] others and these are the characteristics
[1:03:48] that come many times from sexual sin
[1:03:51] when the judgments come down is
[1:03:53] everybody still listening this morning i
[1:03:55] was just checking i'll be done here in
[1:03:56] just a minute but
[1:03:59] too many times when someone else sins
[1:04:02] they're the quickest to bring out the
[1:04:04] quotes
[1:04:09] when their wife makes a mistake they got
[1:04:10] all the quotes for it
[1:04:13] and they're going to hold them to the
[1:04:15] quotes
[1:04:22] and it's because there's condemnation
[1:04:24] already there in david and he's going to
[1:04:26] be exposed by the prophet and so now he
[1:04:28] comes down harsh the harshest judgment
[1:04:31] what he didn't realize is that judgment
[1:04:33] he gave was going to be his own judgment
[1:04:35] so now my text when all the judgments
[1:04:37] start coming down now he will be the all
[1:04:40] the judgments and i got to get to these
[1:04:41] final points because i got my time here
[1:04:43] he will be forgiven of god thanks be to
[1:04:47] god for the grace of god that he will be
[1:04:49] forgiven of this terrible sin
[1:04:51] how many is grateful for the grace of
[1:04:53] god
[1:04:54] david would be forgiven and his life
[1:04:56] would be spared but his house will have
[1:04:59] trouble for many years down the road
[1:05:02] there'll be a sword in his home there'll
[1:05:04] be trouble in his families there'll be
[1:05:06] sexual troubles pop up in his families
[1:05:08] and grace says though you will not die
[1:05:11] that's grace you will not die you know i
[1:05:13] think we should learn from this this
[1:05:15] morning saints of god that that there
[1:05:18] should be a sensitivity to sin
[1:05:21] sexual sin has consequences like no
[1:05:24] other
[1:05:25] and it should make us say lord cover me
[1:05:28] with your blood in this generation keep
[1:05:32] me pure why because it can have a
[1:05:34] devastating impact on those that i love
[1:05:38] in my family and my life
[1:05:44] here's what the prophet said about it
[1:05:48] when david did that evil thing his own
[1:05:50] judgment should have killed him
[1:05:52] when that prophet came up there he
[1:05:53] thought he was it was hid david thought
[1:05:55] it was hid when that prophet come up
[1:05:56] there and stood before him he said david
[1:05:58] is everything going right said
[1:06:00] everything's fine
[1:06:02] i'm fine i'm fine prophet said a lot of
[1:06:06] people say this and they're bound by
[1:06:07] habits and bound by addictions and if
[1:06:09] you're asking how you doing
[1:06:12] everything's good
[1:06:14] the first step
[1:06:16] is to start being honest don't say
[1:06:18] you're doing good when you're doing bad
[1:06:21] you're bound by something then say i
[1:06:24] know the lord can help me say positive
[1:06:26] things but don't you dare hide and say
[1:06:28] when the prophet nathan said david how
[1:06:30] you doing i'm fine i'm fine the
[1:06:33] kingdom's glorious praise be to god
[1:06:43] when the prophet came david's
[1:06:45] everything's going right said everything
[1:06:47] is
[1:06:48] fine
[1:06:49] david in his high robes and his big
[1:06:52] crown and he had job out there his great
[1:06:54] general and all the fighting going on he
[1:06:55] was keeping all the enemies off the bore
[1:06:57] lines and things somebody else was doing
[1:06:59] his battle for him everything was going
[1:07:00] right he had a baby by this bathsheba
[1:07:02] and the poor little uriah go out there
[1:07:04] and had joab to stand by his side until
[1:07:06] he withdrew from him
[1:07:08] and the boy died when the sun went down
[1:07:09] with the battle knife and his hand blood
[1:07:11] on his shield where he had stood for
[1:07:13] israel yet a proselyte he was a
[1:07:15] proselyte to the children he was he he
[1:07:17] was to their religion then when joab
[1:07:19] come back and told him that david uriah
[1:07:21] died david thought everything's all
[1:07:23] right now i've got his wife and
[1:07:25] everything will be all right got a baby
[1:07:26] but the baby took sick the baby started
[1:07:29] dying
[1:07:30] and he'd done everything he could to
[1:07:31] save that baby's life perhaps every
[1:07:33] doctor come no good
[1:07:35] finally the baby died they was afraid to
[1:07:37] tell david and the baby was dead and he
[1:07:39] died and then he thought everything was
[1:07:40] hid so he comforted bathsheba he had
[1:07:43] already taken her for his wife after all
[1:07:45] those other wives i wanted to stop there
[1:07:46] making him he's got all kinds of wives
[1:07:48] god's blessed them with all kinds of
[1:07:50] wives that's why i say having all those
[1:07:52] wives
[1:07:53] to be be fulfilled in in all the ways he
[1:07:57] lifts his passions
[1:07:59] all that's not good enough
[1:08:01] i want this woman that's on the computer
[1:08:06] you can't that's not a right mental mind
[1:08:09] that's thinking
[1:08:11] that's the devil that's entered in
[1:08:13] can i get an amen
[1:08:15] because brother branham says he says god
[1:08:17] he's taken for his he had already taken
[1:08:19] for his wife after all those wives now
[1:08:21] he wants bathsheba this old prophet old
[1:08:23] ball-headed fellow stomped in old nathan
[1:08:25] out of the wilderness sat down said
[1:08:27] david how's everything going said fine
[1:08:29] fine o prophet of god live forever
[1:08:32] hallelujah
[1:08:35] oh he was just he thought everything was
[1:08:37] fine he thought he could hide it but you
[1:08:40] can't hide from god he knows what you're
[1:08:42] thinking right now
[1:08:44] he knows your thoughts for he's god that
[1:08:46] that holy spirit that's in the building
[1:08:48] this morning how many believe the holy
[1:08:50] spirit's in the building this morning
[1:08:52] it's in the buildings and knows your
[1:08:53] thoughts who you are where you come from
[1:08:56] what you've done for jesus christ is the
[1:08:58] same yesterday today and forever
[1:09:01] god had revealed to that old that
[1:09:02] prophet he said david there's a rich man
[1:09:04] lived on the side of the road he had a
[1:09:06] whole lot of sheep oh he was very rich
[1:09:08] and a man lived on the side of the road
[1:09:10] was poor he had one lamb he treated it
[1:09:12] like a daughter he fed it out of the
[1:09:13] same spoon he fed with he ate with he
[1:09:15] slept with the lamb everything was just
[1:09:17] it was just a daughter like a daughter
[1:09:19] to him god had revealed and one day a
[1:09:21] visitor came so instead of the rich man
[1:09:23] taking one of his own sheep and making
[1:09:24] feasts with the visitor well instead of
[1:09:26] that he went over and took the poor
[1:09:28] man's lamb and by force took the lamb
[1:09:30] and slayed it and made a feast
[1:09:32] now that was david's now that was
[1:09:35] david's passions now notice he takes the
[1:09:37] story
[1:09:38] of the man taking the ulam that didn't
[1:09:40] belong to him and brother brahms.com
[1:09:43] that was david's
[1:09:46] passions because he's taking a wife
[1:09:49] that's not his
[1:09:51] in the name of his passions i'm king i
[1:09:53] can do it in the name of his pride in
[1:09:56] the name of his passions he had 500
[1:09:58] wives when he's seen you i his wife
[1:09:59] instead of taking one of the 500 wives
[1:10:00] to ops and satisfy his passions he went
[1:10:03] took took this other man's wife then
[1:10:06] killed uriah when she became a mother
[1:10:07] david didn't know what he was doing why
[1:10:09] david was ready to pronounce judgment
[1:10:12] that's the way we are we can always oh
[1:10:15] boy i need another hour to preach we can
[1:10:18] always judge the other fellow
[1:10:22] but when it comes to us oh that's
[1:10:25] different stay right there
[1:10:28] we are professionals
[1:10:31] at finding the quotes
[1:10:33] for everybody else
[1:10:41] we are fruit inspectors
[1:10:45] and we are so good at inspecting
[1:10:47] everybody else's fruit from their lives
[1:10:51] but god didn't make us fruit inspectors
[1:10:54] he said you shall know them by their
[1:10:55] fruits
[1:10:57] but he didn't say you are my fruit
[1:11:00] inspectors
[1:11:02] he didn't say that
[1:11:04] and brother branham is right we always
[1:11:06] are so easy to judge someone else
[1:11:10] but we need to look in the mirror
[1:11:12] that's what david did and david not only
[1:11:15] said you know what that guy gets killed
[1:11:17] that's it and he by doing that he was
[1:11:19] the man he pronounced his own judgment i
[1:11:21] want to say to you this morning
[1:11:22] sometimes we pronounce our judgment and
[1:11:24] i thank god for the grace of god because
[1:11:26] when we pronounce it on ourselves
[1:11:28] because we do that i deserve to die i'm
[1:11:30] going to do this i'm going to quit doing
[1:11:31] this i'm going to i'm going to in my
[1:11:32] life i'm going to do this that's our own
[1:11:34] judgment but thank god for his grace
[1:11:37] his judgment is sufficient can you say
[1:11:39] amen his grace is sufficient his
[1:11:42] whatever he comes as a conclusion i'll
[1:11:44] take it even over my own judgment
[1:11:48] even what i think of myself and what
[1:11:49] i've concluded in myself i'll take god's
[1:11:51] any day
[1:11:55] david said the man will pay for his life
[1:11:57] that old prophet then eyes narrowed down
[1:12:00] said david sure you'll not die watch
[1:12:02] grace there go to work right quick the
[1:12:04] spirit struck the prophet saved david's
[1:12:06] life grace notice the the title of the
[1:12:09] sermon up there the message of grace and
[1:12:11] here he's talking about it the spirit
[1:12:13] struck the servant david's life grace
[1:12:15] surely you'll not die but the sword will
[1:12:18] not leave your house till it's
[1:12:20] thoroughly purged your heart
[1:12:22] for you are that rich man oh it was
[1:12:25] different then wasn't it i want you to
[1:12:26] notice what he said just go back just
[1:12:28] you'll not die but the sword will not
[1:12:31] leave your house till it's thoroughly
[1:12:33] purged your heart when i read that i
[1:12:34] said that's my life
[1:12:38] i'm going to end this now is there
[1:12:39] another let me read the rest of it i'm
[1:12:41] going to end this because i know
[1:12:42] what saved david when his own judgment
[1:12:44] said the man will die he'll he'll pay to
[1:12:46] the uttermost he'll pay for his life and
[1:12:48] the prophet said surely grace shall not
[1:12:50] die you'll not die david grace has saved
[1:12:51] you it was grace to david that saved him
[1:12:53] oh my if it hadn't been for grace where
[1:12:57] would we all be
[1:13:01] it's just it it's nothing complicated
[1:13:02] about it it's unmerited favor and i
[1:13:05] believe everyone under the sound of my
[1:13:07] voice i believe is under that grace and
[1:13:09] you should lift your hand and say
[1:13:11] i didn't deserve it grace is something
[1:13:13] you don't deserve but he gave me it
[1:13:14] anyhow
[1:13:16] he gave me it anyhow
[1:13:19] and he's he's he's he's saying there
[1:13:22] about david
[1:13:25] the sword's going to be in your house
[1:13:27] there's going to be sexual problems come
[1:13:29] up
[1:13:31] but you're
[1:13:32] i'm giving grace to you you deserve to
[1:13:34] die but i'm giving you your life you
[1:13:36] know what david i believe he was
[1:13:38] grateful
[1:13:40] you know friends i'm going to speak from
[1:13:41] my heart now just about 10 minutes
[1:13:44] there's a lot of troubles that can come
[1:13:46] in our life
[1:13:48] and some of them
[1:13:50] we can't ever correct
[1:13:54] if king david had a a word from god that
[1:13:57] said you're going to have trouble in
[1:13:59] certain areas in your house throughout
[1:14:01] generations then how do we get off with
[1:14:03] that we're going to have things happen
[1:14:06] that we won't
[1:14:07] be able to correct
[1:14:09] even when we ask god
[1:14:16] you say well i don't want to live with
[1:14:17] all those things well you created most
[1:14:19] of them
[1:14:21] don't blame someone else
[1:14:24] but there are certain things i learned
[1:14:25] from the scriptures that there's trouble
[1:14:26] sometimes and you reap what you sow
[1:14:29] but that doesn't mean god didn't give me
[1:14:31] his grace
[1:14:34] and so we shouldn't say but i thought
[1:14:36] his grace
[1:14:38] would just fix all of these things and
[1:14:42] sometimes he does
[1:14:43] but sometimes he doesn't
[1:14:45] but it's not our interpretation of god's
[1:14:47] grace
[1:14:48] give me this lord and give me that and
[1:14:50] seal it up over here and give me that
[1:14:52] give me correct this and it's all your
[1:14:54] problems you're wanting him to correct
[1:14:56] do this do this and sometimes god says
[1:14:59] here's here's my judgment
[1:15:00] i'm giving you grace and i'm leaving
[1:15:02] things in your life that should have
[1:15:04] been taken from you but i'm giving you
[1:15:06] those things by my grace
[1:15:08] but there's some other things that are
[1:15:09] going to always be with you how many
[1:15:11] knows when you get a wound you get a
[1:15:13] scar and the scar's there for life
[1:15:16] that works physically it works
[1:15:18] emotionally too
[1:15:20] but god gives us grace to heal our
[1:15:21] wounds
[1:15:24] though the scars are always there
[1:15:26] but i want to close this by saying that
[1:15:30] we shouldn't interpret to god what his
[1:15:32] grace should be we should be satisfied
[1:15:36] with what grace he gives us
[1:15:41] and if you you think well david's life
[1:15:43] was spared by the grace of god and i
[1:15:45] know david was very grateful that
[1:15:47] because he knew he was a dead man he
[1:15:48] should have died for what he did should
[1:15:50] have been taken out he should have been
[1:15:51] taken out of his position
[1:15:54] he should have died but if we take it
[1:15:56] spiritually now
[1:15:58] all that you've been through
[1:16:00] all that you've done all the mistakes
[1:16:02] that you've made and some of you even
[1:16:04] still paying for it a bit
[1:16:06] just by the fruit that's come from it
[1:16:09] and yet
[1:16:10] if we're talking about
[1:16:12] a spiritual life
[1:16:14] there's some reason you're here this
[1:16:16] morning and something in you
[1:16:19] has not been killed
[1:16:24] because god could have killed for the
[1:16:26] things you've done could have killed
[1:16:27] your spiritual life that you'd never
[1:16:29] want to say amen never want to dock in
[1:16:30] the door of the church never want to be
[1:16:32] in my own gospel preaching never have
[1:16:34] anything in here to say man or desire
[1:16:36] god or hunger for god he could have
[1:16:38] killed that in you because god gave that
[1:16:39] to you
[1:16:42] but let's lift our hands and say thank
[1:16:44] you lord it's still here
[1:16:47] his graces is still here
[1:16:50] so god that god gave him grace in that
[1:16:52] and i'm closing i promise you i'm
[1:16:54] closing i'm closing to say
[1:16:57] that he may not have fixed all the
[1:16:59] trouble that would come
[1:17:02] but
[1:17:04] he changed david
[1:17:07] he took david's anger
[1:17:11] he took away david's defensiveness
[1:17:15] and he took away his critical spirit
[1:17:19] because a few chapters later he's with
[1:17:21] his
[1:17:22] soldiers
[1:17:23] and shimayi comes up and starts to cuss
[1:17:26] at him
[1:17:27] and his soldiers though you can't just
[1:17:29] respect the king like that i'll take
[1:17:30] your head off right now let me add them
[1:17:32] david and dave said no no no god told
[1:17:35] him to do that
[1:17:38] did anybody notice
[1:17:40] the defensiveness is gone
[1:17:42] the anger is gone
[1:17:44] the critical spirit is gone
[1:17:51] and that was god's grace too
[1:17:55] he not only spared his life and his
[1:17:58] spiritual life because he still loved to
[1:18:00] go to the house of god
[1:18:01] he still had a passion for god
[1:18:04] he not only got rid of that
[1:18:06] excuse me nobody who kept that but he
[1:18:09] got rid of his anger
[1:18:11] a story there's stories that come later
[1:18:13] you can see david's been changed
[1:18:15] and it looks like in the bible he
[1:18:17] doesn't deal with things but it's not
[1:18:18] that he doesn't deal with things you
[1:18:19] could say that but it's that he has more
[1:18:21] grace in his heart and i will say to you
[1:18:24] when you've had a revelation of the
[1:18:25] grace that's been given to you
[1:18:28] it kills your criticalness of other
[1:18:31] people
[1:18:34] when grace floods your heart and you see
[1:18:36] what he's done
[1:18:38] you're not a legalistic critical person
[1:18:41] to criticize
[1:18:43] and be a fruit inspector for everybody
[1:18:45] else
[1:18:47] shimmy ice is cursing them
[1:18:48] you're not nothing just going at him
[1:18:52] joab says let me adam like a good deacon
[1:19:02] david said no he's a changed man
[1:19:05] he's lost his defenses he's lost his
[1:19:07] criticalness he's lost
[1:19:09] a lot of his anger it doesn't mean he
[1:19:10] probably don't get angry enough but
[1:19:11] towards someone else like that god
[1:19:13] softened him and so
[1:19:16] he lost some things
[1:19:19] but through it all he didn't lose some
[1:19:21] other things
[1:19:23] doesn't the song say that brother kenny
[1:19:26] i lost a lot of things but i never lost
[1:19:29] my hope
[1:19:31] i never lost my joy
[1:19:33] i never lost my praise
[1:19:39] [Applause]
[1:19:48] he fasted
[1:19:51] he sought god please save this child
[1:19:54] please lord and god come says and then
[1:19:56] he struck the child and they come and
[1:19:57] told him david besought the lord the
[1:19:59] child david fasted went in and lay all
[1:20:01] night god please kind of like with paul
[1:20:03] seeking god about his his problem that
[1:20:06] he had i think it was a blindness
[1:20:07] problem he saw god three times about it
[1:20:10] god did not answer god did not give him
[1:20:12] that
[1:20:14] and it was to keep him humble
[1:20:17] lest he should be exalted god allows
[1:20:19] some things in our life to keep us
[1:20:20] humble
[1:20:23] i'm not talking about spirits binding us
[1:20:25] god delivers from spirits but sometimes
[1:20:27] he leaves things in our lives to keep us
[1:20:29] humble
[1:20:30] sometimes he gives us children to keep
[1:20:32] us humble
[1:20:36] raya i love you i love to tell this

[1:21:57] he ain't that good
[1:22:05] if you have pride
[1:22:08] just have kids
[1:22:11] they'll humble you
[1:22:14] this is my last scripture when he finds
[1:22:16] out that god did not answer his prayer
[1:22:20] and the child died and the elders of his
[1:22:22] house rose and went with him to raise up
[1:22:24] from the earth but he would not neither
[1:22:25] would he eat bread with him so while
[1:22:26] he's fasting he wouldn't even rise up to
[1:22:28] eat anything he fasted he was in
[1:22:30] he was seeking god about this baby i
[1:22:32] want this baby
[1:22:34] came to pass on the seventh day that the
[1:22:35] child died and the servants of david
[1:22:37] feared to tell him that the child was
[1:22:39] dead for they said behold while the
[1:22:42] child was yet alive we spake unto him
[1:22:44] and he would not hearken to our voice
[1:22:45] now will he then
[1:22:48] how will he then decks himself if we
[1:22:49] tell him that the child is dead but when
[1:22:51] david saw that this certain servants
[1:22:52] whispered david perceived that the child
[1:22:54] was dead therefore david said unto his
[1:22:56] servants is the child dead
[1:22:58] and they said
[1:22:59] it's dead
[1:23:03] then david
[1:23:04] arose from the earth
[1:23:06] and washed and anointed himself
[1:23:10] and changed his apparel and came into
[1:23:14] the house of lord and worshipped
[1:23:20] oh i don't know how to bring this last
[1:23:22] thought god i hope you can they can
[1:23:25] catch it
[1:23:27] you have that you know at that point
[1:23:28] he's willing in his attitude to say
[1:23:31] i'm thankful for the grace you've given
[1:23:33] me
[1:23:35] and i'm accepting
[1:23:38] i'm accepting
[1:23:39] the trouble
[1:23:41] and my heart being hurt you've taken
[1:23:43] this child i'm accepting the
[1:23:46] trouble but i'm embracing your grace
[1:23:51] you know what i'm going to do with the
[1:23:52] trouble

[1:23:59] to church
[1:24:02] quit hanging around all those message
[1:24:04] people i'm tired of this i'm finished
[1:24:07] it's not david it shows something's
[1:24:09] happened to him
[1:24:12] god made something happen to
[1:24:14] us because when he found out god didn't
[1:24:17] answer his prayer
[1:24:19] he washed himself
[1:24:20] he got anointed he put on the right
[1:24:23] music
[1:24:26] he changed the atmosphere in that home
[1:24:29] and he went to the house of god and he
[1:24:31] worships reminds me of another guy job
