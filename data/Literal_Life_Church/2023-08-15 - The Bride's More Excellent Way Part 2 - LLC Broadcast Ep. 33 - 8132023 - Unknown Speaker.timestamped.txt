[3:43] [Music]
[3:57] First Corinthians 12 and 31 is just one
[3:59] scripture and we'll continue talking
[4:01] about the more excellent way the bride's
[4:04] more excellent way and Paul mentions it
[4:07] in the Bible here first Corinthians 12
[4:08] and verse 31 he says but covet earnestly
[4:12] the best gifts and the reason that Paul
[4:14] mentions the gifts of the Spirit is
[4:17] because he's just spent several chapters
[4:20] talking about the gifts and not just
[4:22] talking about gifts that work in the
[4:24] church but he's actually correcting how
[4:26] they were using them and making sure
[4:27] they're in order and making sure it
[4:29] doesn't get off track and there's
[4:31] another reason Paul corrects it is that
[4:33] we tend to when we have the gifts we
[4:35] tend to get just a bit carnal with them
[4:36] in that we lean on something the gifts
[4:39] more than they do more than The Giver of
[4:42] the gifts and that's car that's human
[4:45] tendency is that when you have a gift if
[4:47] you have a big display of Miracles and
[4:49] signs and wonders which Our God can do
[4:51] we've had here in the church cancer
[4:54] healed we've had testimony is around the
[4:57] world of the Dead being raised you say
[4:59] well my I don't ever hear that well it's
[5:01] happening because Jesus Christ is the
[5:03] same yesterday today and forever he's
[5:05] able to do everything he's ever done
[5:07] before he's able to do it this morning
[5:09] again so you can imagine now your habit
[5:11] that you have you think you'll never
[5:13] overcome nothing is too hard for the
[5:15] Lord
[5:16] if he can heal the sick he can raise the
[5:18] dead still then God can do anything this
[5:20] morning and so you see then that that
[5:23] Paul is not only talking about coveting
[5:26] the best gifts he's never eliminating
[5:28] the gifts but there's a tendency in
[5:30] human beings to gravitate towards the
[5:32] visible and to the manifestations and to
[5:35] the healings and the physical things and
[5:37] we get you know excited rah-rah about it
[5:39] but our tendency is to cling to seeing
[5:43] the gifts
[5:44] and not have a relationship with The
[5:46] Giver
[5:48] and and not have the substance of what
[5:51] the giver wants to bring from our lives
[5:54] and what he wants to bring from our
[5:55] lives is not just Miracles and signs and
[5:58] wonders and signs following life he's
[6:00] wanting to bring Holy Ghost manifested
[6:03] Divine love
[6:06] from our lives and this is what Paul
[6:08] refers to now as he says covet earnestly
[6:11] the best gifts all you Corinthians yet
[6:14] show I unto you a more excellent way
[6:18] and then he takes the next chapter and
[6:20] he begins to explain the more excellent
[6:23] way and that's what we're going to by
[6:24] the grace of God do this morning so
[6:25] here's I want to begin with something uh
[6:28] that William Branham said the first
[6:31] quote here and and he's referring to
[6:33] this scripture Paul talking up to the
[6:36] Corinthians about the more excellent way
[6:37] and I just the reason I brought it into
[6:40] our PowerPoint is I wanted to bring some
[6:42] of the quotes in this PowerPoint and
[6:44] also I wanted to bring this in a
[6:46] teaching because today the Lord willing
[6:48] I want to break down the more excellent
[6:49] way I want to break down the attributes
[6:51] of this love and in order to do that I
[6:54] just want to open it with just this
[6:56] quote and William Branham was a had a
[6:58] powerful Ministry in the 50s and 60s and
[7:01] we believe that he fulfilled scripture
[7:02] even to bring us back to Bible faith if
[7:04] you're interested in hearing more of
[7:06] that which certainly would share anyone
[7:07] here would share more of that with you
[7:09] but I'm going to read from what
[7:11] something he said in a sermon and it's
[7:13] just a powerful thing and as he refers
[7:16] to Paul correcting the Corinthians he
[7:18] says listen at that Stern old Apostle
[7:21] drive it into this Sensational church
[7:24] now he taught he called the Corinthians
[7:26] a sensational church and that means they
[7:28] were more about sensation than they were
[7:30] substance and he said listen to this old
[7:33] uh Stern old Apostle drive it into this
[7:36] Sensational Church who is basing their
[7:38] hopes upon sensation now this is Sunday
[7:41] school this is a place of Correction
[7:42] this is a place of teaching and woe unto
[7:45] the man that will stand in the pulpit
[7:47] and mislead brother it's time that we've
[7:49] made you're compared with scripture
[7:51] that's right and though I bestow all my
[7:53] goods to feed the poor Paul said though
[7:55] I give my body to be burned and have not
[7:58] charity it prevaileth me nothing see all
[8:00] your good works all your good deeds all
[8:04] the spiritual things you have all the
[8:06] gifts you have all the sensations you
[8:08] have all the joy you have all the peace
[8:10] you have has nothing at all to do with
[8:12] it to begin with think of that just a
[8:14] moment and think of the churches today
[8:16] our great churches Presbytery Aryan
[8:19] Methodist Baptists and denominational
[8:21] they think because they say I Believe
[8:24] come in put your name on the book and
[8:27] that settles it that settles it how far
[8:29] they're off and so there is dealing with
[8:31] just coming and putting your name on a
[8:33] book and that's good enough then he goes
[8:35] into the Pentecostals in the next one he
[8:37] says our Pentecostal people think well
[8:39] because they got a little sensation they
[8:42] felt good they spoke with tongues they
[8:44] got a blood in their hand oil in their
[8:45] face or something we got it we got it oh
[8:48] 10 million miles off you get it see how
[8:51] the devil as the God of this world has
[8:53] blinded the eyes of those and they just
[8:55] go right on living like that listen for
[8:58] although I bestow all my goods to feed
[9:00] the poor though I give my body to be
[9:03] burned and have not charity I am nothing
[9:05] look at all those gifts all those good
[9:08] things I feed the poor I got a good
[9:10] heart about me I do this I do that I go
[9:13] to church I speak with tongues I
[9:15] prophecy I prophesy I heal the sick I
[9:18] preach the gospel I do these things Paul
[9:21] said Still Still I am nothing all those
[9:25] things can be carnally impersonated
[9:29] the devil can imitate all of these good
[9:31] works and that's why when you come to
[9:34] the Lord and come to the message of the
[9:36] last days it's not just books and tapes
[9:38] and good works and wearing the right
[9:40] dress and wearing the right clothes can
[9:42] you say man you've got to have the
[9:44] substance of the Holy Ghost living in
[9:46] you
[9:47] or and because why do you have to have
[9:50] Holy Ghost love why do you have to have
[9:52] the substance of the Holy Ghost because
[9:53] true Holy Ghost love cannot be imitated
[9:56] cannot be impersonated but all these
[9:59] gifts they can be impersonated
[10:01] so if you just had the gift Satan can
[10:03] impersonate them now once again Paul's
[10:05] not dumping out the gifts he's not
[10:07] dumping out going to church he's not
[10:09] dumping out the tongues and
[10:11] interpretation he's not saying any of
[10:12] that he's just saying that if you live
[10:15] on that and don't have the substance and
[10:17] have not charity it doesn't mean
[10:19] anything you could put your name on the
[10:21] church book and say I'm fine that's all
[10:23] I need to do that's the intellectual
[10:25] side as long as I believe all the
[10:26] mysteries of the Bible that's fine all
[10:28] the Mysteries revealed and then he
[10:30] swings in the rest of the quote to the
[10:31] other side and Pentecost will say
[10:33] because I shouted because I smoke in
[10:35] tongues because I had a sensation I'm
[10:37] fine I'm good and Paul all the way back
[10:40] 2 000 years ago is saying you can swing
[10:42] either way and not have the right thing
[10:45] this right is called to find this more
[10:48] excellent way my Hunger is that I find
[10:51] this more excellent way
[10:53] more so than a gift more than preaching
[10:56] more than singing more than doing good
[10:58] works I want to find this more excellent
[11:00] way because Paul preached it and I
[11:02] believe at the end time is when this
[11:04] bride comes into that atmosphere to
[11:06] manifest Divine love
[11:09] so we shouldn't leave on just live on
[11:12] just what we do as good works and so now
[11:14] Paul he's going to break things down in
[11:17] the most beautiful words I believe about
[11:18] agape love that's ever been said I
[11:21] believe he's going to be begin to
[11:22] express what is this in First
[11:25] Corinthians 13 and many of you have read
[11:27] it probably everybody's read it and see
[11:29] and so what is what this what is Paul's
[11:31] going to bring is the evidence of this
[11:34] mature Capstone love and what it looks
[11:37] like in our everyday life what it looks
[11:39] like in a Christian's life he's going to
[11:42] begin to break down the attributes of
[11:45] this Capstone love and what it looks
[11:47] like in our life and most of it is
[11:50] manifested towards others
[11:53] we know we love God can you say man but
[11:57] it's it's when we what we're expressing
[12:00] in Christ is not meant just to express
[12:03] to God but it's to be expressed and
[12:05] manifested to everyone else
[12:08] and also it's to be expressed to very
[12:11] difficult situations meeting up with
[12:14] difficult people and a lot of times you
[12:17] think you're thinking of somebody
[12:18] outside the boss or something or the
[12:19] lady who who uh drove by you and got mad
[12:22] at you because you you stayed too long
[12:24] at the red light because you were
[12:26] texting and she comes by and gives you
[12:29] the wrong finger and all that stuff you
[12:31] see but you think it's people like that
[12:33] we need to love that person anyway but
[12:35] the greatest challenge is the people we
[12:37] live with every day
[12:39] because we know them so well and they
[12:41] they know how to get our gizzard they
[12:43] know how to say the right things
[12:47] so this comes down to everyday life so
[12:50] we're going to talk about
[12:52] there's 15 characteristics
[12:55] in this love and I don't want you to
[12:58] read them as if this is some type of
[12:59] code to live by or sometimes if I can
[13:02] just do this and get the what would
[13:04] Jesus do bracelet and if I can be more
[13:06] like him and imitate these things don't
[13:09] approach these things this way because
[13:11] Divine love is not something that we put
[13:13] on
[13:14] it only comes by him who is Love by the
[13:17] Holy Ghost but when we have the Holy
[13:20] Ghost if we'll break down our walls and
[13:23] are Prejudiced and all the things and
[13:25] our hurts from the past and be free this
[13:28] is what comes out of Capstone love
[13:32] love is patient
[13:35] love divine love is kind
[13:40] love
[13:41] is not jealous
[13:45] love does not brag or boast
[13:49] this Divine capsule love is not proud or
[13:52] arrogant this Divine love is not rude to
[13:56] anybody
[13:58] love is not
[14:01] self-seeking
[14:03] love is not easily provoked to anger
[14:09] Divine Capstone love does not keep a
[14:12] record of others wrongs
[14:16] Divine Capstone love does not rejoice
[14:19] with injustices or iniquity
[14:23] it doesn't gloat or get happy over some
[14:26] injustice that's done and they got what
[14:28] come what's coming to them they did they
[14:31] do not rejoice with injustices or
[14:33] iniquity love rejoices in something it
[14:36] rejoices when truth prevails
[14:39] love bears and protects things that's
[14:43] what Bears all things means it means to
[14:45] protect things love protects things love
[14:47] bears all things we're going to find out
[14:48] the meaning of that it's hard for me not
[14:50] to go into the meetings right now but I
[14:52] just want you to see them all love bears
[14:54] and protects all things and remember now
[14:56] I'm not making this up when Paul said
[14:58] I'm going to show you a more excellent
[14:59] way this is the more excellent way
[15:03] love bears and protects love love
[15:06] believes the best of things first
[15:10] love always has hope for all things and
[15:14] love endures and holds up during
[15:17] difficulties
[15:19] I'm going to break these things down and
[15:21] I've been breaking them down looking at
[15:23] the Greek words for these words looking
[15:26] the Amplified looking through different
[15:28] things
[15:30] researching it and I don't want just
[15:33] man's opinion but I want to know what
[15:35] these words mean when he says love is
[15:38] patient and that's the first one love
[15:41] is patient
[15:43] the scripture says now we exhort your
[15:46] brother and warn them that are unruly
[15:47] Comfort the feeble-minded support the
[15:49] weak
[15:50] be patient toward all men
[15:53] and the Amplified we earnestly urge you
[15:55] Believers admonish those who are out of
[15:57] line the undisciplined the unruly the
[15:59] disorderly admonish those ones give them
[16:02] a slight rebuke because they're out of
[16:04] line they're undisciplined they're
[16:05] unruly give them a slight rebuke
[16:07] do that to those who are unruly
[16:09] encourage the timid those who lack
[16:11] spiritual courage courage encourage the
[16:14] timid help the spiritually weak
[16:18] these are things that we want to do as
[16:20] Christians be patient with everyone
[16:24] always controlling your temper
[16:28] so
[16:30] when we look at this word patient
[16:33] it means that It suffers long it never
[16:35] gives up it is slow to lose its patience
[16:39] it does not demonstrate irritations or
[16:43] reflect anger or have a quick temper I'm
[16:46] going to say that again it does not
[16:48] demonstrate irritations or reflect anger
[16:51] or have a quick temper and as I said
[16:55] these things are really tested in the
[16:56] people we live around every day more
[16:58] than anybody else
[17:00] the Greek word for patient comes from
[17:03] two words meaning long tempered long
[17:05] tempered that's in the Greek if you're
[17:07] patient you're slow to anger you endure
[17:10] personal wrongs without retaliating if
[17:14] you bear with others imperfections false
[17:16] differences you bear with other people's
[17:19] imperfections faults and differences you
[17:21] give them time to change room to make
[17:24] mistakes without coming down hard too
[17:26] quickly on them
[17:28] do you do that men with your wife and
[17:30] children he's asking some questions as a
[17:32] pastor here do you do that with others
[17:34] do you do that with your wife and
[17:35] children at home you you give them time
[17:38] to change room to make mistakes without
[17:40] coming down hard
[17:43] you bear with other imperfections faults
[17:45] and reminding you of the scripture he
[17:48] said be patient with everyone always
[17:50] always controlling your temper so this
[17:53] patience it goes further just just
[17:56] little human patience it's divine love
[17:58] patience
[18:00] it's his patience Express and you know
[18:03] the reason you know the best place we
[18:04] can see it God's Divine patience with
[18:08] you
[18:11] all this originates in God can you say
[18:14] Amen how much patience has he had with
[18:16] you how many times should he have lost
[18:19] his temper over you
[18:22] but when this flows from the very throat
[18:24] of God through the Bride of Jesus Christ
[18:26] there's a patience that goes beyond just
[18:28] human patience
[18:30] can you say Amen
[18:32] and it goes beyond here's here's an
[18:34] example of it going Beyond in the late
[18:36] 1500s Dr Thomas Cooper edited a
[18:39] dictionary with the addition of 33 000
[18:41] words and many other improvements to the
[18:43] dictionary he had already been
[18:45] collecting materials for eight years
[18:46] eight years he did this when his wife a
[18:49] rather difficult woman went into his
[18:51] study one day while he was gone and
[18:53] burned all of his notes under the
[18:56] pretense of fearing that he would kill
[18:58] himself studying too much
[19:01] she burned everything eight years of
[19:03] work a pile of Ashes Dr Cooper came home
[19:06] saw the destruction asked who had done
[19:08] it his wife told him boldly that she had
[19:11] done it the patient man heaved a deep
[19:13] sigh
[19:16] and said oh Dinah Dinah thou has given a
[19:20] world of trouble
[19:23] thou has given a world of trouble that's
[19:25] the way they said it back in back then
[19:27] thou
[19:28] Dinah Dinah
[19:30] you have given thou have given a world
[19:33] of trouble
[19:34] that's all he said
[19:36] then he quietly sat down
[19:39] to another eight years
[19:41] of hard labor
[19:42] to replace the notes
[19:44] which she had destroyed
[19:47] that was it
[19:50] next time you think you've arrived at
[19:52] being patient
[19:54] I'll read that story to you again
[19:58] the next one is love is kind
[20:01] love is kind be kind one to another
[20:04] tenderhearted forgiving one another even
[20:08] as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven
[20:11] you
[20:12] in the Amplified it says be kind and
[20:14] helpful to one another tenderhearted
[20:17] compassionate understanding forgiving
[20:20] one another readily and freely just as
[20:23] God in Christ also forgave you so the
[20:26] first thing that we see about the
[20:28] kindness of divine love kindness being
[20:30] expressed to one another it is closely
[20:33] related to forgiveness
[20:37] the word forgiveness is mentioned with
[20:39] kindness because really you can't
[20:41] manifest true kindness towards someone
[20:44] unless you're forgiving to someone
[20:47] it's when we're not kind is that when
[20:49] we're not being forgiving we haven't
[20:51] forgiven them for something we're
[20:53] holding a grudge of something they did
[20:55] to US 10 years ago they're never going
[20:57] to be in in my eyes the same they did
[20:59] this that's it that's an unforgiving
[21:01] Spirit that'll bind you did you realize
[21:04] it's not binding them it's binding you
[21:06] be kind and helpful to one another
[21:08] tenderhearted not hard-hearted
[21:12] tenderness tenderhearted may the Lord
[21:15] Jesus I pray this morning take the
[21:17] harshness out of my heart towards people
[21:21] take the hard bitter years of things and
[21:24] then when somebody does a similar thing
[21:26] to me my heart becomes hard again oh God
[21:29] deliver me from that give me a tender
[21:31] heart towards everybody no matter what
[21:34] they've done past present or future the
[21:37] only thing that's going to come out of
[21:39] this vessel is kindness towards that
[21:41] person it's the kindness tender heart
[21:43] and gentle has ability
[21:45] to soothe hurt feelings
[21:48] to calm and upset person to help quietly
[21:51] in practical ways and the reason I'm
[21:52] saying this is the Greek word comes from
[21:54] a word meaning useful this is the
[21:58] kindness in the Greek word is useful
[22:00] a kind person is disposed to be helpful
[22:04] instead of instead instead of being not
[22:06] helpful if you got a bad attitude
[22:08] towards them that's not helping the
[22:10] matter
[22:12] if you're gossiping about him that's not
[22:14] helping people
[22:15] but kindness becomes useful how can I
[22:17] become useful to see a result of this
[22:21] kind person is disposed to be helpful he
[22:23] seeks out needs and looks for
[22:25] opportunities to meet those needs
[22:27] without repayment he is tender and
[22:31] forgiving when he or she is wronged he
[22:36] expresses kindness this kindness
[22:38] responds with kindness to people that
[22:42] are being harsh towards you
[22:43] Bible says in the Old Testament a soft
[22:46] answer turns away Wrath
[22:50] a soft kind answer it turns away Wrath
[22:56] and so be kind to one another tender
[22:58] heart and forgiven it's tied to
[22:59] forgiveness in fact forgiveness is the
[23:01] spirit that would actually make a person
[23:03] be more kind forgiveness there needs to
[23:06] be more talk about forgiveness God's
[23:09] forgiveness God's love of forgiveness
[23:10] it's hard to forgive others when we
[23:13] haven't really realized the complete
[23:15] forgiveness God has given us
[23:17] it starts with us before we can give it
[23:21] out you have to examine yourself
[23:24] how much has God forgiven you
[23:27] and if some of you think well he hasn't
[23:30] had to forgive me for a lot because I
[23:32] haven't really done a lot bad
[23:40] so you're looking at the other person
[23:42] and they're bad that's really bad but
[23:45] your bad isn't that bad
[23:49] who put you in charge of terming
[23:52] determining what was bad
[23:53] my Bible says he that's guilty of the
[23:56] least is guilty of the whole
[23:58] we got level smoking and drugs and
[24:00] drinking and all this and we got bad
[24:02] that's really bad that's bad but in
[24:03] God's books I can go back there to
[24:05] Psalms or Proverbs somewhere it is he
[24:07] says the seven things that God hates and
[24:09] there wasn't any smoking and drinking in
[24:11] there it was one who sows Discord among
[24:14] the Brethren it was one who has hatred
[24:16] in their heart
[24:18] that's the things God hates
[24:21] so who determines what's bad
[24:24] and if you're saying my bad is not as
[24:27] bad as bad this guy's bad bad's bad
[24:32] you already have something bad you have
[24:34] pride you have a religious spirit
[24:36] you think you're better than everybody
[24:39] you never find the Forgiveness that you
[24:42] need to forgive somebody else unless you
[24:44] look at yourself first
[24:47] because whatever they did
[24:50] you without God are capable of doing the
[24:53] very same thing
[24:56] I didn't expect to say this this morning
[24:57] but I'm saying it you without any of God
[25:00] in your life are capable of doing
[25:02] everything that person that's so bad
[25:04] that you think and you can't forgive
[25:05] you're capable of it
[25:07] you would do it without any restraints
[25:10] you would have done the same thing you
[25:11] would have looked at the same thing you
[25:13] would have committed adultery the same
[25:15] way
[25:18] now we start to come into feeling
[25:20] unworthy before God and then grateful to
[25:24] God that the only way that I worry
[25:26] Worthy is because of Calvary because
[25:30] before that person stuck a needle in his
[25:33] arm before that person got addicted to
[25:34] pornography before that person become an
[25:37] alcoholic
[25:38] before they did any of that they were
[25:41] already a sinner
[25:43] unacceptable to God
[25:48] so don't give me these levels of
[25:49] different things
[25:52] that say Lord
[25:54] I realize you've really forgiven me of a
[25:58] lot
[25:59] forgiveness is tied to kindness if you
[26:01] have something in your heart to forgive
[26:04] you're going to be more kind to people
[26:08] can we do one more today
[26:10] love
[26:12] is not jealous
[26:15] love is not jealous
[26:17] so before I read the scriptures it says
[26:20] here
[26:20] about jealousy now
[26:23] the word means
[26:26] it leans in the Greek to an eagerly
[26:28] desire and is used both positively and
[26:31] negatively in your Bible jealousy in the
[26:33] negative senses related to Greed and
[26:35] selfishness the jealous person wants
[26:37] what others have he wants things for
[26:39] himself he is too selfish to applaud
[26:41] others success
[26:44] James says now we're in the Book of
[26:46] James jealousy is often the source of
[26:48] quarrels and conflicts
[26:52] by James 4 2 from Winston Wars and
[26:54] fightings among you come they not of
[26:56] your own lust
[26:58] so so
[26:59] um jealousy
[27:01] most the time is the source of arguments
[27:06] and quarrels and fussing Dwight Moody
[27:09] said I'd rather win souls than win
[27:11] arguments it's a good feeling to Wagon
[27:14] win an argument to argue to get okay and
[27:16] you won at the end that's why we do it
[27:19] there's a jealousy to to want to win I'm
[27:21] going to win I'm going to win what if we
[27:23] were just to let that go and release and
[27:25] release that jealousy and release all
[27:26] that back and there'd be less arguments
[27:28] there will be less fusses less fightings
[27:31] less Wars
[27:34] see Lord kill all the jealousy in me I
[27:37] don't want to have any jealousy and if
[27:39] we kill the jealousy we kill the
[27:41] arguments we kill more of the tension
[27:43] what kind of homes would we have if we
[27:46] say Lord take the jealousy in my heart
[27:49] and Lord Purge it by the holy spirit
[27:52] this to me is the Revival of the Bride
[27:56] this is the Capstone love she comes into
[28:00] the whole culmination of the entire
[28:02] message that you believe all culminates
[28:03] I believe in this Capstone love and
[28:06] living it every day by the Holy Ghost
