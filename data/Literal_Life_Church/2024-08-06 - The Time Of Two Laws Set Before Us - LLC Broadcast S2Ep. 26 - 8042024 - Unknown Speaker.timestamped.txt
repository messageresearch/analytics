[3:15] Clos
[3:18] day walking close to
[3:24] me let it
[3:26] be dear Lord let it
[3:33] be let it
[3:36] be dear Lord let it
[3:41] be let it
[3:47] be Deuteronomy chapter 30 and verse 15
[3:50] and
[3:52] 16 see I have set before thee this day
[3:56] life and good and death and evil in that
[4:01] I command thee this day to love the Lord
[4:04] thy God to walk in his ways and to keep
[4:08] his Commandments and his statutes and
[4:10] his judgments that thou mayest live and
[4:13] multiply and the Lord thy God shall
[4:15] bless thee in the land whether thou
[4:17] goest to possess it you probably read
[4:20] these in Sunday school and you've read
[4:21] them maybe many times but I would like
[4:24] you to look at the the order that God is
[4:26] calling for towards the end of Israel's
[4:29] journey and Moses is getting ready to go
[4:31] off the scene this is the end of
[4:33] Deuteronomy and uh this he he's saying
[4:36] when we come to the end here before
[4:38] going in the promised land there's
[4:40] there's two things set before you two
[4:42] things set before you there's two laws
[4:45] there's two choices that you would have
[4:48] to make and that's between life and
[4:50] death and so then but I want you to
[4:52] notice the already says I command these
[4:54] day to love the Lord thy God to walk in
[4:56] his ways that's first before he says
[4:59] keep his
[5:01] Commandments notice the order it doesn't
[5:04] say keep his Commandments and then you
[5:06] will love me it says to love me
[5:09] first notice the order love me because
[5:12] that's priority because if if you don't
[5:15] when one is without the other you have a
[5:17] message of God that is not complete and
[5:19] will not lead to its fullness when you
[5:21] have keeping the Commandments without a
[5:24] passion and life and love for the one
[5:27] who gave us the Commandments then we
[5:29] begin to when we have one without the
[5:31] other the Commandments without the love
[5:34] and the W and walking in his ways and
[5:37] when we have the love and some Churches
[5:40] try to ditch the Commandments and ditch
[5:42] the principles of God and say it's only
[5:44] about love no we want both but I can
[5:46] tell you when one is without the other
[5:48] when you have Commandments without this
[5:51] life without this love without knowing
[5:55] him who gave us the Commandments then
[5:57] our message of God is not complete and
[6:00] it will not not lead us to the fullness
[6:03] of what he gave us I'd also add in verse
[6:06] 19 and 20 where it says that again I
[6:08] call Heaven and Earth to record this day
[6:10] against you that I have set before you
[6:12] life and death blessing and cursing
[6:15] therefore choose life that both thou and
[6:18] thy seed may live may live that thou
[6:21] mayest love the Lord thy God that thou
[6:23] mayest obey his voice and that thou
[6:25] mayest cleave unto him for he is thy
[6:31] life and the length of thy days that
[6:34] thou mayest dwell in the land which the
[6:35] Lord swear to thy fathers to Abraham to
[6:37] Isaac and to Jacob to give them when we
[6:39] come to Moses saying I've set these two
[6:42] things before you if that time back then
[6:45] is like our time then I really believe
[6:47] that we're living in a time that two
[6:49] laws is set before the people and uh you
[6:52] know let me just say something about
[6:54] laws um laws are laws are a good thing
[6:58] um if laws are abused then we find that
[7:01] we uh those that understand laws in our
[7:05] land that's the simplest way to explain
[7:07] to our children we're thankful for some
[7:09] of the laws that we have um there are uh
[7:12] government officials that I believe that
[7:14] are abusing uh making new laws that
[7:17] don't fit certain things in common sense
[7:20] and just common decency and common uh
[7:23] just what a man is and what a woman and
[7:25] different things but I think that's
[7:26] abuse of it and that's what always
[7:27] happens is there's an abuse use of the
[7:29] laws but some of our laws were given for
[7:32] a good motive they're good given for our
[7:34] protection and laws themselves can be a
[7:37] a motivator or the the thing that we
[7:40] live by a law is something that we live
[7:42] by and some laws you're living by this
[7:44] you say I don't live by any laws well
[7:45] yeah you do you're hopefully going to
[7:47] stop at a stop sign and hopefully you're
[7:49] going to obey the laws of the land so
[7:51] you you live by some of them all people
[7:53] say I don't live by any law it's really
[7:55] only what they're talking about is Bible
[7:56] law that's what they don't live by but
[7:58] you have to live by other laws and there
[8:00] are laws of nature there's a laws of
[8:02] gravity and you're under that law this
[8:04] morning or you would be flying and
[8:05] floating around the
[8:07] room laws are there and there are powers
[8:09] that are there and uh we we are under
[8:12] those some of those laws and some of
[8:14] them uh there's a a motive law is a
[8:17] motivator that we live by it's a power
[8:20] that pushes us uh but we must know the
[8:23] purpose of the one who is behind it I
[8:25] just give a little example one time when
[8:27] my children were little and they must
[8:29] must have got a little afraid sometimes
[8:31] when Daddy would get pulled over
[8:33] sometimes you know you got little kids
[8:34] and they're scared to death and they're
[8:35] wondering why the police is coming up to
[8:37] the door one time we were coming across
[8:39] the border and we were trying to bring
[8:41] another vehicle that I'd purchased from
[8:42] a sister there in Windsor and uh so I I
[8:45] knew I had to go through and check
[8:46] everything and I had the paperwork but
[8:48] oh man when they seen me there those
[8:50] police got around me pulled me to side
[8:52] there's police all over the car I had
[8:53] all my children in the car I think I
[8:56] scared them because one time I was going
[8:58] down through Sylvania here I said to the
[9:00] kids kids hey you know why do we wear
[9:02] seat belts because so the police don't
[9:06] catch
[9:07] us and I realized then I was a failure
[9:09] as a parent I have failed I realized
[9:13] that quite a bit even off later lately
[9:15] is I realized I was a failure because I
[9:17] did not teach them the reason why we
[9:20] wear the seat belts they should have
[9:22] been saying if I would have been the
[9:23] right parent and taught them right they
[9:25] would have said it's for my protection
[9:28] it's because that we might have an
[9:30] accident and I could get killed you see
[9:33] but they said because the police might
[9:35] catch us what a terrible
[9:39] Dad no it's it's there are things that
[9:43] are the people who pass the law this is
[9:46] the way you can look at it and I'm just
[9:48] going to speak from my heart this
[9:49] morning I I pray that it'll be a
[9:51] blessing to you and so when you go back
[9:53] to a law there there's people who pass
[9:56] the laws even for a seat Bel in many of
[9:59] the laws
[10:00] and the people who pass that law you can
[10:02] look at it this way they must have cared
[10:04] for me they must have cared for life
[10:06] they must have cared for my life to make
[10:08] that law there are other laws that are
[10:10] not that that way they're just to make
[10:12] things more inconvenient for us I'm
[10:14] convinced of that as well but there are
[10:16] some laws with the right motive behind
[10:19] it can you say am man there are some
[10:22] laws with the right motive there's some
[10:24] things that are said that have the right
[10:27] author behind it and the right person
[10:29] and they love and they care for my life
[10:32] and that's why they're writing the law
[10:34] now friends I don't believe putting God
[10:36] in a place of his laws about man God is
[10:39] not man and I can tell you safely that
[10:43] anything God sends from his throne for
[10:45] his people is for their
[10:49] good when you trust God that way you
[10:51] know he had to send it for some reason
[10:54] even if I don't understand it God had to
[10:58] send these things for my good because he
[11:01] loved me but when we look at it as an
[11:03] inconvenience or we don't trust the one
[11:06] who sinned it and we say they just sent
[11:08] this seat Bel law to make my life more
[11:10] inconvenient when you look at it that
[11:12] way that's the way you're going to look
[11:13] at it but if you can go back to the
[11:15] author and see somebody cared for Life
[11:19] somebody cared for my life so I will do
[11:23] it and because there's a reason behind
[11:26] it the love behind it not that I might
[11:29] get caught so how many of how much of
[11:33] the
[11:34] message do we follow and
[11:37] live because we might get caught you
[11:40] know fear is a motivator but it's not
[11:42] the best motivator so so you see now I
[11:46] want you to look at some things today
[11:47] and some things you will know maybe some
[11:49] things you won't know but this is what
[11:51] the Lord has given me and I feel to
[11:52] bring it this morning and and see I'm
[11:54] not more perfect because I wear my seat
[11:57] belt every time there are some people
[11:59] people who think that they're more
[12:00] perfect because they wear their seat Bel
[12:02] every time I'm not more perfect because
[12:05] of that but I'm more safe because I made
[12:07] a personal decision to put that seat
[12:10] belt on it's in relation to who I carec
[12:15] that I care so so we know that the
[12:17] person who wrote the law cares for my
[12:19] life and now we come back in response in
[12:22] relation to I do this because I care now
[12:26] the person who wrote it cares but now I
[12:29] care because someone else cared for me I
[12:32] care to do it because someone else cared
[12:35] for
[12:36] me I care to observe this I care to do
[12:39] this and this goes back to what the
[12:41] prophet said he says we don't do these
[12:43] things out of Duty we do it out as our
[12:45] love back to him we love him can you say
[12:49] Amen we do it out of respect and
[12:51] appreciation for the grace that he has
[12:53] given us we do things in reflection and
[12:56] and response in love I care because
[12:59] someone cared for me can you say Amen so
[13:02] now I'm still feeling led to stay in
[13:04] this time frame of Israel after 40 years
[13:07] and God said you remember at the first
[13:08] of Deuteronomy he said something there
[13:11] that we had been preaching on it's time
[13:13] that you get off of this mountain you've
[13:14] circled this mountain long enough you
[13:16] circuit it for 40 years and it's time to
[13:19] turn northward that's what he said it's
[13:21] time to turn northward because this and
[13:24] because this type is perfectly speaking
[13:26] of our time right now I am pulling some
[13:29] uh more nuggets out of it and going back
[13:31] into this area to feed on this because
[13:34] we realize there's so much importance to
[13:36] this call that God said to Israel you
[13:39] have come out of Egypt but now you've
[13:41] been wandering for 40 years in this
[13:43] message and it's time for you to stop
[13:46] that and it's time for you to move
[13:49] northward which northward met as the map
[13:52] I showed you northward met it's time to
[13:54] move into the full
[13:55] promise it's time to move in to to the
[13:59] full promise how many would raise your
[14:00] hand and say I believe it's time in my
[14:02] life to move to the full promise not a
[14:05] portion of it but to the full promise
[14:08] that's my desire so if that's the call
[14:11] then what is it that they were to come
[14:13] out of in order to go in they came out
[14:15] of Egypt but now what do they have to
[14:17] come out of now they moved out of the
[14:20] World when they moved out of Egypt Egypt
[14:21] is a type of the world and God comes and
[14:24] you I've got many sitting here that was
[14:26] living in all kinds of sin and different
[14:28] things and they didn't have that uh New
[14:30] Birth they didn't have they didn't know
[14:32] there was life available to them and so
[14:34] something happened to them and they were
[14:36] called by the message of the Lord Christ
[14:39] saying come out of that bondage come out
[14:41] of the world come out of all those
[14:43] things and so we see that happened
[14:45] individually in every life and it has to
[14:48] happen in every life but you see now
[14:50] there's something about when we go along
[14:52] with the Lord many years that he he
[14:54] calls to go to the higher calling even
[14:57] though I can look back and say well 20
[14:59] years ago he called me to this but
[15:01] things in the middle you see things in
[15:03] the midst of time Satan can still work
[15:06] to try to bind you and try to get you
[15:09] stuck somewhere I like to say to people
[15:11] what's your hurdles why' you quit what
[15:14] what's going on can I help you over your
[15:16] hurdles can we talk about it we can talk
[15:18] about anything but can I help you as a
[15:20] minister to get over your hurdles
[15:22] because it's not them it's not other
[15:24] people it's the enemy that causes you to
[15:27] get discouraged
[15:30] if you don't get anything else this
[15:31] morning know this one thing that's one
[15:33] thing they had to come out of is that
[15:35] the 40 after 40 years the message had
[15:38] become a lot of discouragement things
[15:41] that are
[15:43] discouraging if you don't get nothing
[15:45] else God's calling us out of all the
[15:47] discouragement no wonder no wonder
[15:50] Joshua the first chapter in Joshua he
[15:52] says Be Strong be courageous it's time
[15:56] to stand up and have courage why is he
[15:59] saying that because they had lived with
[16:01] so much
[16:03] discouragement around the group of the
[16:05] message after 40 years there were other
[16:08] things restricting their worship you
[16:09] remember they come out of bondage and
[16:11] boy Pharaoh was controlling them and uh
[16:15] they come out of pharaoh and not only
[16:17] did God deliver him from pharaoh and
[16:18] that kind of bondage he washed the whole
[16:20] Army in the Red Sea and no wonder they
[16:23] danced and shouted when you feel free
[16:26] from your
[16:27] pharaohs you don't have to have a
[16:30] seminar on worship you're going to come
[16:32] and worship God you feel free in your
[16:35] spirit can I get an
[16:37] amen you feel free in your spirit
[16:40] because God has taken care of your enemy
[16:43] God has drowned your pharoh in the Red
[16:45] Sea can you say Amen why don't you lift
[16:47] your hand and say I need God to drown my
[16:50] Pharaoh in the Red Sea he can do it
[16:52] again can you say amen and when you do
[16:55] you feel free in your spirit you feel
[16:57] like something is lifted from you I'm no
[17:00] longer under the thumb of pharaoh to
[17:02] make me do what I don't want to do I
[17:04] feel free to serve the Lord I feel free
[17:06] to Worship the Lord I feel free to shout
[17:08] I feel free to dance can you say amen I
[17:11] feel free in the Holy Spirit nothing is
[17:14] quenching the spirit in my life anymore
[17:16] I can free I Can Be Me In
[17:19] Christ that's where I want to be but
[17:21] guess what guess what Satan knows that
[17:24] freedom and after 40 years some of the
[17:26] people had come under bondage again so
[17:29] if you're in bondage again you need
[17:31] another setting free can I get an amen
[17:34] you need another setting free because
[17:36] the the at the end of the day is are you
[17:38] free are you free to worship are you
[17:40] free in your spirit are you free by the
[17:43] Holy Spirit and are you living the
[17:44] Commandments by love and by the Holy
[17:48] Spirit there is no other way to live his
[17:52] Commandments oh what a miserable journey
[17:55] to live as Commandments without the Holy
[17:57] Spirit life in you what a miserable
[18:01] life glory be to God so they were free
[18:06] to worship and then after 40 years there
[18:09] was other things restricting their
[18:10] worship something developed that would
[18:12] put them in bondage again they received
[18:14] the law but if they made are you
[18:17] listening they received the law on Mount
[18:20] on the mount God brought the law the 10
[18:22] commandments they receive the law but if
[18:25] they made that law more important than
[18:28] love grace mercy and the one the leading
[18:32] of the Holy Spirit and the one that gave
[18:35] the law if may they made that law more
[18:38] important than love than Grace than
[18:41] Mercy than the leading of the spirit and
[18:44] the one who was leading them if they
[18:46] made that law more
[18:48] important it was going to be death for
[18:52] them the same law that was meant to
[18:55] bring life would bring death now I'm
[18:58] writing the scripture cuz Paul picks it
[19:00] up in the New Testament we'll read the
[19:01] scripture in a minute Paul picks it up
[19:02] he's calling the law it's death without
[19:04] the spirit of Life to Live it it's
[19:07] death the law is death it has to have
[19:12] life in you God sends something as he's
[19:16] done in
[19:17] many uh slots throughout the ages if you
[19:20] read your Bible you can you can tell and
[19:23] even history shows when everything got
[19:25] bad God sends something to his people
[19:27] God sends a messenger God sends a
[19:30] message and God sends something and
[19:33] human nature is to make it something
[19:36] different than what God sent it
[19:39] for now we might as well just be real
[19:42] honest here this morning the people can
[19:44] turn it into something that God never in
[19:47] intended for it to it to
[19:51] be God send something and we make it
[19:53] something else then we say thank you God
[19:57] you know thank you for sending your
[19:59] message I'll take it from
[20:02] here that's what they did for 40 years
[20:06] you gave us the law you gave us but now
[20:08] all of us this fussing over the law now
[20:11] all this I'm better than you and you're
[20:13] better and I'm living it closer to you
[20:15] and and uh but quote battles and but
[20:18] Moses said this over here but here's a
[20:20] quote from Moses over here and all of
[20:22] this carnality and all this stuff just
[20:25] comes out of this and it's like they're
[20:27] saying thank you God for sending this we
[20:30] got it from
[20:32] here failing to really be led by the
[20:34] Holy Spirit who sent the law I'm here to
[20:37] say that Grace and His Holy Spirit and
[20:39] love is to continue to lead us for the
[20:42] finish of this
[20:44] journey not just the
[20:47] start amen
[20:50] so praise the Lord that we have
[20:52] something praise the Lord that God sends
[20:54] something and then you know once people
[20:56] they start say God thank you for sending
[20:58] this I'll take it from here I'll break
[21:00] it down from here I'll tell everybody
[21:02] from here then it's got truth in it and
[21:05] so then because we got truth we got
[21:07] truth let's see who can memorize it the
[21:10] best let's see who can know the best
[21:12] quotes from Moses let's show how
[21:14] everyone else is wrong and we're right
[21:16] with the message that we have let's show
[21:18] others how more knowledgeable we are or
[21:21] how better dressed we are we've got the
[21:23] best dress code and we start showing off
[21:26] with the truth that he gave us we start
[21:29] developing a pride with the truth that
[21:31] he gave us can you say am man there are
[21:33] people in the world today who uh were
[21:36] the the they were the most extreme
[21:38] legalistic versions of the truth that we
[21:41] have and I had them in my church they're
[21:44] not even they're not even around today
[21:46] they they have no some of them are
[21:48] atheists but when they were here with me
[21:51] they were some of the most rigid
[21:53] legalistic had their kids on the front
[21:55] row and if their kid dozed off they
[21:57] slapped them in the head and so they
[21:59] would wake up oh that was so funny they
[22:02] said they had it down and their kids
[22:03] were perfect and they were dressed
[22:05] perfect and they look perfect and I'm
[22:07] serious if they dozed off the mom just
[22:10] go ahead sister Jane you probably
[22:11] slapped them in the head wake
[22:15] up and nobody who could dressed as
[22:17] perfect as them and no they were the
[22:19] perfect example supposedly of what this
[22:23] message
[22:24] is and that's because over time in the
[22:27] message you have two
[22:30] laws right you have two laws and you
[22:33] have a choose a choice you choose life
[22:36] of this message or you choose just the
[22:39] law which is death and today they're
[22:42] spiritually
[22:44] dead there's no
[22:46] life oh they have they're living but I
[22:49] mean spiritual life it's gone it's gone
[22:52] because when every person will make the
[22:56] choice to choose the life of this or to
[23:02] choose death we think okay these
[23:06] scripture we read in Sunday school
[23:07] choose life or choose death choose a
[23:10] blessing choose a cursing and we think
[23:12] that was out when people in the world
[23:13] come and choose the life no this is
[23:15] people that he's saying to this after
[23:18] watching the prophet for 40 years
[23:20] they've got a choice now what are you
[23:22] going to choose are you going to choose
[23:24] the life within you or you're going to
[23:26] choose just the law is this okay don't
[23:30] answer that this is the truth we've got
[23:32] it let's see who can memorize it the
[23:33] best let's show how everyone is wrong
[23:35] and we're right let's show others more
[23:36] knowledge we're more knowledge we're
[23:38] better dressed and and so then then we
[23:41] have Exodus 19 going back now at the
[23:43] beginning of the journey Exodus 19 where
[23:46] the Prophet said that Israel made their
[23:48] fatal mistake what was that fatal
[23:50] mistake they chose law over
[23:53] Grace now the law you can't dump out the
[23:55] law Jesus said I come not to destroy the
[23:58] law there's many churches today that are
[24:00] just destroying the law we only need
[24:02] Grace but no you don't understand no God
[24:05] sent the things but he never sent it to
[24:07] be lived out without the Holy Ghost
[24:09] without life and so now we don't dump
[24:12] out the law but he said in Exodus 19 can
[24:15] you get your Bible and open it let's go
[24:17] back and look what he said it uh excuse
[24:19] me yeah Exodus 19 this is what it all
[24:21] began and he said in these scriptures
[24:24] not Genesis Exodus 19 I want you to read
[24:27] this with me this when they began the
[24:30] journey and verse three and Moses went
[24:33] up to God and the Lord called unto him
[24:34] out of the mountain saying Thou shalt
[24:36] thou say to the house of Jacob and tell
[24:38] the children of Israel ye have seen what
[24:40] I did unto the Egyptians and how I bear
[24:42] you on Eagle wings and brought you unto
[24:44] my South notice what he says where was
[24:47] he bringing them where did God set why
[24:49] did I destroy Pharaoh where am I
[24:51] bringing you I'm bringing you to
[24:54] myself this is about a relationship now
[24:56] therefore if you obey my voice indeed
[24:58] keep my commandment then you shall be a
[25:00] peculiar treasure unto me above all
[25:02] people for all the Earth is mine and you
[25:04] shall be unto me a kingdom of priests
[25:06] and a holy nation these are the words
[25:08] which thou speak unto the children of
[25:09] Israel and Moses came and called for the
[25:11] Elders of the people and laid before the
[25:13] faces all these words which the Lord
[25:15] commanded and all the people answered
[25:17] together and said all that the Lord hath
[25:19] spoken we will do and Moses returned the
[25:22] words of the people unto the Lord
[25:24] they're making a promise they can't
[25:26] keep there is no hint in their
[25:29] confession to do this that Lord I still
[25:32] need you to lead me I need your grace
[25:35] and I want to follow you the author that
[25:37] wrote this there's no words in this it's
[25:39] just okay you gave it to me I'm going to
[25:42] go do it tell me what I need to do and I
[25:43] promise you I do it that's a promise
[25:45] they couldn't keep not without life what
[25:49] they should have been saying I love you
[25:50] Lord and I need you I can't do this
[25:53] without you and your leadership and the
[25:55] Holy Spirit leading my life and if I can
[25:57] just stay close to you then I know by
[25:59] your grace I'll be able to follow these
[26:02] boundaries and follow these strings by
[26:04] your grace I'll do it unmar and favor
[26:06] there's no humility to say I just want
[26:09] to love you I just want to follow you I
[26:12] just want to be near you and this
[26:14] wonderful word that you've given me to
[26:17] live will be lived by you when I love
[26:22] you is anybody getting it this
[26:25] morning they should have said I love you
[26:27] Lord with all my heart soul mind and
[26:30] strength I see your ways I see the way
[26:32] that you are I'm impressed with the way
[26:34] that you are matter of fact some of
[26:36] God's more character was coming out in
[26:38] these Commandments of how a person can
[26:40] live with God inside Thou shalt not
[26:42] commit adultery Thou shalt not uh steal
[26:45] Thou shalt not think and it it it wasn't
[26:47] necessarily it should have been
[26:48] shouldn't have been worded Thou shalt
[26:50] not it should have been worded that this
[26:52] is how a Believer will live when they
[26:55] got God living in their heart they won't
[26:58] do these things because life is
[27:01] motivating them most of Christianity has
[27:05] Twisted even the Ten Commandments to
[27:08] make it if you live by that by the law
[27:11] you'll make
[27:13] it and that's not
[27:16] true you live by it because of love you
[27:20] live by it because the author who sent
[27:22] it he cared for you and now you care
[27:25] about him but it's all that mode of how
[27:28] many of the Ten Commandments did I Live
[27:30] this week and I was up to about eight
[27:33] and a
[27:34] half last week doing pretty good Lord
[27:39] give me credit for eight and a
[27:41] half who taught us that
[27:43] way let me tell you something in your
[27:46] human
[27:47] weakness you could fail all 10 of
[27:50] them then where you at with God does his
[27:53] love stop does his Mercy stop does his
[27:56] grace stop no it can't it's when you as
[28:00] he said he said love him and cling to
[28:03] him it's when you're clinging to him and
