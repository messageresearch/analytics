[0:00] chapter 40
[0:01] and
[0:03] a passage of scripture that is quoted
[0:05] many times Isaiah 40 talking about us
[0:09] renewing our strength and mounting up
[0:10] his wings as Eagles I know we know that
[0:12] from the song and many sermons that's
[0:15] been preached on it so we are
[0:17] appreciative of these things but I just
[0:20] wanted to elaborate on that tonight and
[0:23] speak about young men and women renewing
[0:26] their strength
[0:28] young men and young women renewing their
[0:31] strength so the scripture starts here in
[0:33] verse 28 hast thou not known
[0:36] has thou not heard that the Everlasting
[0:38] God the Lord the creator of the ends of
[0:41] the Earth faith not nor is neither is
[0:44] weary and aren't you glad tonight that
[0:47] our God doesn't faint he doesn't get
[0:49] weary he doesn't get weak he's never
[0:52] weak he's strong because when we get
[0:55] weak he is strong can you say Amen when
[0:58] we have where we're fainting when we're
[1:00] having when we're that way then we know
[1:02] that our the creator of heavens and
[1:04] earth does not do that there is no
[1:06] searching of his understanding verse 29
[1:08] he giveth power to the faint and to them
[1:11] that have no might he increaseth
[1:14] strength even the youth shall faint and
[1:18] be weary and even the young men shall
[1:21] utterly fall
[1:23] but they that wait upon the Lord shall
[1:26] renew their strength
[1:28] they shall Mount up with wings as Eagles
[1:33] so if it's about eagles we ought to perk
[1:36] up our attention because we're Eagles
[1:39] I mean he's an eagle here tonight and it
[1:42] was the end time to have to give the
[1:43] story about the chicken and the chicken
[1:45] the Barnyard and the eagle getting
[1:47] misplaced there and he never felt
[1:49] comfortable we know the story and so it
[1:51] took Mama evil to come above and scream
[1:54] and then he knew who he was and once he
[1:56] was able to fly then he could fly and
[1:58] get in his category so to speak that we
[2:01] are not just we're not called to be
[2:03] chickens but Eagles and the other
[2:04] scripture says wheresoever the carcass
[2:06] is and the end time there were the
[2:07] Eagles be gathered together so when
[2:10] something perks up when we when we hear
[2:13] the term the Eagles and they shall Mount
[2:15] up with wings as eagles they shall run
[2:18] and not be weary and they shall walk and
[2:21] not fade heavenly father bless your word
[2:24] as we do a study tonight and I pray that
[2:27] you anoint us that you make us bold in
[2:29] your spirit Lord and father we break
[2:31] things down so that we understand in
[2:33] this teaching uh the kind of lives that
[2:35] we can live that manifest strength in
[2:38] this hour and especially I see our youth
[2:41] so we commit this subject to you and we
[2:42] pray you'll bless it tonight in Jesus
[2:44] name amen unless you may be seated
[2:49] and from the text we see that this
[2:53] speaks of an extreme weariness that's
[2:56] taking place I actually believe that
[2:57] this could be prophecy for our day
[2:59] because we we realize that it's uh if
[3:03] you go and study the whole chapter then
[3:06] you see that they were given to Idols in
[3:08] verse 18 so it was a nation that's given
[3:10] to very much Idols when you have Idols
[3:12] you have images of the mind you have
[3:15] things take place where people are
[3:16] distracted from God and the true worship
[3:19] of God so this whole theme is is really
[3:22] related to the end time because we
[3:24] realize that we we are the ones that
[3:27] have would have the opportunity or the
[3:29] under the conditions to faint or to get
[3:32] weak or to get wore out and possibly
[3:34] even or to entertain thoughts of giving
[3:36] up that's how the devil wants us to
[3:38] think that we get weary and there's
[3:41] another scripture that says in the New
[3:42] Testament be you not weary in well-doing
[3:45] for in due season you shall reap if you
[3:47] faint not but we realize sometimes we
[3:50] get weak under the conditions and so
[3:53] there there's a there's a weakness that
[3:55] comes our our generation is marked by
[3:58] weakness and adultery Jesus said a
[4:01] wicked an adulterous generation brother
[4:03] Branham quoted it a weak an adulterous
[4:05] generation how many know that we're in a
[4:07] weak generation
[4:08] and by weakness it's not physically weak
[4:11] as such even though we know that the
[4:13] foods that we eat are breaking down our
[4:15] bodies and we're not as strong a people
[4:16] physically as we used to be but it's I
[4:19] when I think of weakness of this
[4:20] generation I don't think I think of weak
[4:22] Minds
[4:23] I think of weak minds I think of Minds
[4:25] that can't think Common Sense anymore I
[4:28] think of things that aren't strong the
[4:30] world thinks of strong and strength and
[4:32] men that are physically strong and maybe
[4:35] now women that are physically strong
[4:37] they think of strength and weakness in
[4:39] terms of that but it's not what about a
[4:41] strength in the mind what about strength
[4:43] in the Lord what about strength in your
[4:45] thinking can you say Amen what about
[4:47] remaining strong and so when the the
[4:49] whole world has got us in a weak
[4:51] condition a weak and adulterous and
[4:53] incidentally that's tied together
[4:54] weakness and uh an adulterous generation
[4:58] is sexual things and sexual perversion
[5:00] are tied to the weakness because when we
[5:03] are weak in the Lord then we're more
[5:04] vulnerable to sexual temptation
[5:08] so a weak and awaken an adulterous
[5:10] duration it all goes together when we're
[5:12] not strong spiritually we will be
[5:14] tempted with many times with sexual
[5:16] things that's why he called it a weak
[5:17] and adulterous generation but you see
[5:20] now when we have extreme weakness we
[5:22] have a fainting we have giving up and
[5:25] this this word when it speaks awareness
[5:27] it's an exhaustion exhaustion it's a
[5:30] depleting this age depletes our strength
[5:32] from us it's a weakening of our spirit
[5:34] many times and it's all related to the
[5:37] spirit and mind not physical but the
[5:40] spirit and the mind weak Minds weak
[5:43] thinkers not strong in Godly thinking or
[5:46] Godly principles that's the age that we
[5:49] live in
[5:50] and so much could be said about that
[5:52] that's not my subject tonight but I want
[5:55] to hone in on how it's going through
[5:57] this and saying when men are weak and
[5:59] this generation is weak he giveth power
[6:02] verse 29 to the faint and to them that
[6:04] have no might he increases strength who
[6:07] does it like brother Danny said last
[6:09] weekend it's not by our own abilities
[6:12] it's not by what we can offer but our
[6:14] strength is in the Lord
[6:17] and thankfully he provides strength when
[6:19] we are weak as a matter of fact when
[6:21] we're weaked and that's when he becomes
[6:23] strong
[6:24] he's the source of our strength and so
[6:26] if we go to the source then what are we
[6:28] going to be we're going to be strong
[6:30] we're going to be strong in our thinking
[6:31] we're going to strong in our minds we're
[6:33] going to be strong in our Spirits we're
[6:35] going to be strong in our soul God's
[6:37] calling a people to be strong in the
[6:38] Lord not weak in the Lord
[6:41] and so but he provides it but right in
[6:44] the middle of this he said even the
[6:46] young people shall faint
[6:49] and be weary
[6:52] and the young men shall utterly fall now
[6:55] that's interesting because when you have
[6:57] young men
[6:58] and you young people that are getting
[7:01] weary and faint it's talking about
[7:03] spiritually now
[7:04] um that's interesting because young
[7:06] people are known for their energy
[7:09] they got a lot of it I mean my my
[7:11] granddaughter they're living with us now
[7:14] and she goes from eight in the morning
[7:17] till about nine at night full steam
[7:19] ahead no naps nothing
[7:22] singing all day
[7:25] and playing all day and has and does not
[7:28] slow down and I'm going I don't know if
[7:31] I can keep up with this or not
[7:33] she goes constantly and so then they
[7:36] grow and they get in their teenage years
[7:38] and you know everything gets going and
[7:40] they've got energy and they've got all
[7:42] these things but here now look at our
[7:43] generation where it used to be older
[7:45] people that was suicidal used to be
[7:47] older people that was in depression now
[7:49] the last 10 15 years we deal with young
[7:51] people in a state of depression we deal
[7:53] with young people considering suicide so
[7:57] now the Devils come in and this
[7:58] weariness and this giving up Spirit
[8:00] comes to the youth and that's really bad
[8:03] when our young people are getting that
[8:04] way
[8:05] it gets you know the devil's really
[8:07] trying to take us when he takes the
[8:09] young hearts that should be excited
[8:11] about life they should be an energetic
[8:13] about life and looking forward to the
[8:15] future and you find a lot of them
[8:17] they're they're afraid of the future
[8:18] they're scared of what's going to take
[8:20] place next it should never be that way
[8:23] the excitement in their eyes the the
[8:25] excitement about the future what does
[8:28] God have for me and the energy and all
[8:31] that should be there and yet they're
[8:32] becoming depressed and of course I could
[8:34] elaborate how what encourages that
[8:36] depression with social media and all of
[8:38] it but that's what they become they
[8:39] become weary our young youth shall
[8:42] become faint and shall be weary and then
[8:45] they have the same promises every one of
[8:47] this a everyone in this age but they
[8:50] that wait upon the Lord they that pursue
[8:54] the Lord they that are looking towards
[8:57] the Lord
[8:58] they that have a Pursuit towards God
[9:01] they're going to find a place to renew
[9:05] their strength
[9:07] glory be to God there's a place tonight
[9:09] to renew your strength there's there's a
[9:12] there's a heart of God that's provided
[9:14] something for this hour that when you're
[9:16] weary in spirit when that Devil's
[9:18] telling you to give up there's a place
[9:20] we can go and set your wings can you say
[9:22] amen and you feel a renewal in the Lord
[9:26] oh my so you know being my subject is
[9:29] for the young people then we thank God
[9:31] that there's a promise that our strength
[9:34] young people if you're listening there's
[9:36] a promise that your strength can be
[9:38] renewed too
[9:40] we will have a source in this new
[9:42] generation and the youth will have that
[9:44] Source too
[9:46] I want to say that we need young people
[9:48] today that are strong
[9:51] in fact there's a calling going out
[9:55] during this in the middle of of Satan's
[9:58] Eden there's a calling going out to the
[10:00] new generation right now through the
[10:01] preaching there's a calling going out
[10:03] how many believe that
[10:05] there's a calling in the middle of
[10:07] Satan's Eden the vision of God is to
[10:09] have young people and what's he calling
[10:11] for he's calling for strong young people
[10:13] he's calling for young people their
[10:15] strength in their minds calling for
[10:17] young people that are strong in their
[10:19] hearts strong in their convictions so
[10:22] strong in their protective boundaries
[10:24] away from the enemy strong girls who can
[10:27] resist a weak Boy
[10:30] he's calling for strong boys that can
[10:33] resist a weak girl
[10:36] strong girls that know how to say no to
[10:39] the wrong type of boy strong boys that
[10:41] know how to say no he when when you talk
[10:43] to boys they always think that they're
[10:45] strong related to their muscle uh build
[10:48] up and their tone but God give us strong
[10:51] boys who stand for the convictions of
[10:53] the word that can say no to Temptation
[10:56] that strength in this hour you're just a
[10:59] statistic if you're just strong in your
[11:01] in your muscles can you say amen and go
[11:04] ahead and do that it's it's great and
[11:06] you know that's work your muscles do all
[11:08] that but listen Solomon said he said uh
[11:11] something about a man that could take
[11:13] and Conquer a whole city he said but his
[11:16] Spirit he can't conquer
[11:19] so he can Flex his muscles and say I've
[11:22] conquered that whole city with the sword
[11:24] in the Army and then he can turn around
[11:25] and he don't have enough strength to
[11:27] ward off the wrong kind of woman
[11:30] and Samson was that way
[11:32] [Music]
[11:33] when the anointing would come on him
[11:35] he'd pick up the fence of a city he
[11:37] would you know he could do anything but
[11:40] a woman that's where his weakness was
[11:42] and it weakened him until she cut his
[11:44] hair and found the source of his
[11:46] strength
[11:47] a woman did that found the source of
[11:50] restraint cut his strength off and so he
[11:53] might have been such a mighty man but
[11:55] what his strength today strength is
[11:57] young men and young women that can stand
[11:59] for their convictions strength is young
[12:01] girls who can stand against the wrong
[12:03] guy and say no strength is young guys
[12:05] who can say no to the Temptations on the
[12:08] internet
[12:10] there's a calling going out to young
[12:12] people today that would be strong young
[12:14] young people and let it be said that
[12:17] strength that does not come as brother
[12:19] Danny was saying this past weekend
[12:20] strength does not come from your ability
[12:23] it comes from the Lord
[12:26] strength does not come from your own
[12:28] mental exercise it comes from the Lord
[12:30] there's a source in the Lord as we wait
[12:33] on him as we look to him as we pursue
[12:37] God then we find the source of strength
[12:40] and the renewal of strength if you're
[12:43] weak there's a call for young men first
[12:45] John 2 14 says I have written unto you
[12:48] young men
[12:50] because ye are strong
[12:53] and the word of God abideth in you he's
[12:56] not talking about old man he's talking
[12:58] about the young man
[12:59] what's God's vision for
[13:02] young boys and young men what's God's
[13:04] Vision that you're strong
[13:08] why do you have to preach this because
[13:09] we got a bunch of weak Lily livered men
[13:13] stand for any convictions
[13:16] they're they're turned into one another
[13:18] instead of a woman and they're they're
[13:20] just you you hear them talk and they
[13:23] sound like a woman and and they they
[13:24] have no vision anymore they don't even
[13:26] know who they are anymore Lily liver no
[13:29] backbone can't even stand up and put
[13:31] their wife in order
[13:33] we live in a generation with men with no
[13:35] backbone whatsoever there's a calling
[13:38] for young men and he says I've written a
[13:40] human because you are strong the vision
[13:42] for young men is that they be strong and
[13:45] the word of God would abide in them and
[13:48] you have overcome the will of wicked one
[13:50] that's the men that God wants to write
[13:51] to that's the men that God wants
[13:54] strong in the word the words abiding you
[13:56] and you have overcome the wicked God
[13:58] give us young men that are overcoming
[14:00] the wicked one
[14:03] come on people say amen can you believe
[14:05] that that's the vision see well what
[14:07] about a woman well look here in Proverbs
[14:09] 31 10.
[14:11] proverbs 31 10 says who can find a
[14:14] virtuous woman for her price is Farber
[14:17] Ruby's skipping along to verse 17. she
[14:20] girneth her loins with strength
[14:25] and strengtheneth her arms now that's
[14:29] not a bodybuilder either don't use that
[14:31] scripture for bodybuilding for women
[14:34] no let's talk about spiritually let's
[14:37] talk about character that God wants
[14:39] strong women of God
[14:42] strong women that know where they stand
[14:44] and know their convictions and know
[14:45] their principles
[14:47] he said she girders are loads of
[14:48] strength of string and arms and then
[14:49] later in verse 25 strength and honor
[14:52] strength and honor are her clothing and
[14:55] she shall rejoice in time to come
[14:57] everything reeks everything comes from
[15:01] her is a strong woman of God it's
[15:03] strength even her clothing speaks of
[15:06] strength not him modesty but strength in
[15:09] the Lord
[15:10] modesty in the Lord a beautiful woman
[15:12] they don't have to dress like an Amish
[15:14] or something I'm not knocking the Amish
[15:15] but her clothing even says I'm strong in
[15:18] the Lord
[15:20] I'm not weak I'm not so I'm making my
[15:23] body cheap to someone else showing parts
[15:25] of my body showing a little more leg and
[15:27] all this stuff that's weakness
[15:28] everybody's doing that but the woman of
[15:31] proverbs 31 she's not only strong and
[15:33] she's not only uh virtuous and she's not
[15:35] only taking care of the things of her
[15:38] household and doing all these things but
[15:40] yet she's her loins are Gert with
[15:41] strength she strengthened her arms and
[15:44] strength and honor are in her clothing
[15:46] and she shall rejoice in time to come
[15:51] Hallelujah I don't have this scripture
[15:54] up there but I thought this was
[15:55] interesting as I found hundreds of
[15:57] scriptures related to this I can't read
[15:59] them all tonight this is about parents
[16:03] Ezra 9 12.
[16:05] says now therefore give Not Your
[16:07] Daughters unto their sons that's the
[16:09] heathen
[16:10] don't give your daughters unto their
[16:12] sons neither Take Your Daughters unto
[16:14] your sons nor seek their peace or their
[16:17] wealth forever that ye may be strong and
[16:21] eat the good of the land and leave us
[16:23] for inheritance for your children
[16:24] forever did you hear what that just said
[16:27] who you give your daughters and sons to
[16:30] will either weaken you or strengthen you
[16:34] parents heads up heads up don't be weak
[16:38] when it comes who you give your sons and
[16:40] daughters to and by the way you do give
[16:42] them away
[16:44] but if you start getting weak in who
[16:46] they're giving away to and give them to
[16:47] the Heathen you're not going to be
[16:48] strong it's going to weaken Generations
[16:51] so you pray about it with them
[16:54] this is a serious thing this is a sober
[16:56] thing well I fell in love well praise
[16:59] the Lord I believe in love but I believe
[17:01] love has a lot more to it than just a
[17:03] feeling
[17:06] he says to the parents don't give your
[17:08] daughters to their sons don't give your
[17:10] sons to their daughters that ye may be
[17:13] strong families
[17:15] strong in the Lord eat the good of the
[17:17] how many want to eat the good of the
[17:19] land
[17:20] and leave an inheritance to your
[17:21] children forever that's not a physical
[17:23] inheritance that's a spiritual
[17:25] inheritance
[17:28] I'm going to go to the story in first
[17:29] Samuel chapter 3 13 now I don't know how
[17:32] far I'll get tonight I suppose that if I
[17:34] don't get too far into it we'll pick it
[17:36] up and finish it on Sunday so you may
[17:38] get a teaching on Sunday as well
[17:40] finishing is up because I intend to
[17:42] finish the subject
[17:44] but the story of amnon and Tamar in
[17:49] First Corinthians 13 and a few a year or
[17:51] so ago I dealt with this and I didn't I
[17:54] didn't cover it all because as I kept
[17:55] reading it there was so much more in
[17:57] there and there's so much that young
[17:59] people can learn out of this story it's
[18:01] a tragic story it's a terrible story
[18:04] it's not unbelievers it's Believers
[18:06] within the kingdom of God it's it's
[18:08] terrible the story of amnon and Tamar is
[18:11] a terrible story it's but it's in the
[18:13] Bible for some reason and every time we
[18:15] have something in the Bible it's for our
[18:17] admonition it's far in for our
[18:20] instruction
[18:21] everyone in brother branham's mistakes
[18:23] uh in his early life I better be careful
[18:26] saying that
[18:29] I said every one of brother Brown's
[18:31] mistakes in his early life
[18:34] because he said he made mistakes
[18:36] he said I trust as I share my life
[18:39] testimony that these will be stepping
[18:42] stones along the way for the young
[18:44] people to see and to be able to learn
[18:46] from those things that you don't say
[18:48] make the same mistakes
[18:50] so first Samuel chapter 13 is a is a is
[18:55] a it's a it's a story and it's a there's
[18:58] so much young people can learn from this
[19:00] story it's so relevant for today because
[19:03] in our time love
[19:06] is not understood
[19:09] true love genuine love even the love for
[19:13] a man for a wife has been misconstrued
[19:17] it's been Twisted it's been perverted
[19:20] and where has it been perverted in the
[19:22] minds of the young people to where today
[19:24] they don't know when you when I say love
[19:27] and they say love it could mean two
[19:29] different things they're thinking about
[19:31] because the generation has
[19:33] uh uh tampered with the meaning of love
[19:37] and so it's uh love this is so important
[19:41] for today because love is misunderstood
[19:43] love is not understood love is Twisted
[19:46] it's perverted and another thing that's
[19:48] uh messed up and not understood is
[19:50] strength as I just spoke of strength is
[19:52] interpreted as I said in physical
[19:54] strength or what um Peyton Manning or uh
[19:58] Thomas Tom Brady could do in football
[20:00] and we look into our heroes for strength
[20:03] and their and the the
[20:05] you know there was a little uh
[20:07] documentary on Tiger Woods that we were
[20:10] looking at when we come home and uh from
[20:13] Ireland and I just I wanted to go
[20:16] through it and see and such a rise and
[20:18] such a tragic story because the push
[20:20] from his father to push him to the very
[20:22] top and he came to the very top golfer
[20:25] in the world and then to watch as he
[20:28] wasn't addressing things in his life
[20:29] than to watch him fall and have to go he
[20:32] went into sexual addiction and he had to
[20:34] go to different therapies for that and
[20:36] then he was in drug therapy and just
[20:39] this his life was all messed up and but
[20:41] yet you got this great Fame and this
[20:43] great strength and nobody could beat him
[20:45] and the world Praises them and lifts
[20:48] them up
[20:49] because the world's Twisted about what's
[20:52] strong
[20:53] but inside he wasn't strong
[20:56] his Spirit wasn't strong so we got to be
[20:59] real careful that we don't take the
[21:00] world's view of what strong is
[21:03] what strength is
[21:07] so
[21:07] [Music]
[21:09] there's some points that we're going to
[21:10] bring out of the story just now as we
[21:12] read it and I might just quickly read
[21:13] through some of it and then I'll go back
[21:15] and make the points and we'll have it up
[21:17] on the PowerPoint tonight and we'll see
[21:20] how many of these we get through
[21:22] but out of this story I've narrowed it
[21:26] down to Five Points of weakness that the
[21:28] young people should look for and Five
[21:30] Points of strength because what you find
[21:32] is Tamar
[21:34] despite the fact that she was alone with
[21:37] uh amnon not necessarily by her own
[21:39] choice but eventually she was alone with
[21:41] them despite her strong responses to
[21:44] this
[21:45] terrible boy despite her strong response
[21:48] but I I I hope I'll get to meet Tamar
[21:51] someday and compliment her because she
[21:54] had things taken away from her it wasn't
[21:56] fair to her
[21:58] but but if you look at her responses
[22:00] about five responses to this boy before
[22:03] the incident happened you will find she
[22:06] had convictions there but because she
[22:08] was in a uh an awkward spot of being
[22:11] alone then her virginity was taken away
[22:14] from her
[22:15] but under normal circumstances these
[22:17] type of strong responses I compliment
[22:20] for because you don't find many girls
[22:21] that's just strong to tell these boys
[22:23] and it's right in the scripture and I
[22:25] think the young people especially the
[22:27] young girls can learn from her
[22:30] convictions and what she said to this
[22:31] boy because you may not need to say it
[22:33] alone with them you may have to but if
[22:36] you got the wrong boy you shouldn't be
[22:37] alone with them anyway
[22:39] but if you're today's alone is not just
[22:42] alone in a car or somewhere else today's
[22:45] alone is on texting that's a loan
[22:51] and
[22:52] I hope that our young girls can get the
[22:54] strength to have these responses
[22:57] to the wrong type of boy in his texting
[23:03] so it says here in Chapter 13 First
[23:06] Corinth the first Samuel not First
[23:08] Corinthians I'm in the Old Testament
[23:09] first Samuel did I say 13.
[23:14] okay well it'd really be a good idea
[23:17] if I go over the second Samuel
[23:21] and it'd be a good idea if I put second
[23:23] Samuel in my notes too that would help
[23:28] all right
[23:30] second Samuel 13 and it came to pass
[23:33] after this that Absalom the son of David
[23:36] had a fair sister whose name was Tamar
[23:39] and amnon the son of David
[23:42] loved her oh
[23:48] so beautiful
[23:50] oh
[23:52] I tell you if you stopped with that
[23:55] verse quit reading I didn't tell you to
[23:56] go any further yet
[23:57] if you stop with that verse this would
[24:00] have been a normal love story
[24:02] she was fair and he loved her and all
[24:05] you can do is just go oh
[24:08] so nice the baby's trying to do it right
[24:11] there oh
[24:14] but now you get to see what this love
[24:18] really was
[24:20] okay if you'd have stopped at that
[24:22] scripture then you wouldn't have read
[24:23] the story right or his mind right or the
[24:26] whole purpose because he's calling it
[24:28] love
[24:30] and amnon was so vexed what what's going
[24:34] on here
[24:35] amnon was so vexed so I wanted to stop
[24:38] on the first point here and am I doing
[24:40] this up here now
[24:41] all right so I'll take it from here I'll
[24:43] take it here I'll take it from here guys
[24:50] this boy is calling this love but he
[24:53] proves it has nothing to do with love
[24:57] at every turn he proves
[25:00] he's using the term love but everything
[25:03] he does there's no love in it so my
[25:06] first point to the young people to learn
[25:07] love what is love love has honor
[25:14] love has respect
[25:17] love has obedience to God and to
[25:20] authorities
[25:23] love is rooted in truth not lies
[25:29] and does it sneak around
[25:32] Love Goes deeper than sexual or natural
[25:36] attraction
[25:38] infatuation is a real thing you can be
[25:41] infatuated and then infatuation can turn
[25:44] to Obsession that's what it did with
[25:46] amnon just an infatuation with their
[25:48] beauty turned to ABS into an obsession
[25:50] with her obsession is not love
[25:54] a lustful obsession is not love so the
[25:57] first thing you have to learn about this
[25:59] story he's calling it love but
[26:01] everything he does from this point in
[26:03] his fruits to his life shows it's not
[26:05] love and the young people need to know
[26:07] how do I know it's true love brother
[26:08] Paul I may be attracted she may be
[26:11] pretty he may be handsome he may be good
[26:14] looking great wonderful but when you
[26:17] start using the term love don't think
[26:19] that just looks is love
[26:22] don't think that just attraction is love
[26:26] don't think that physical attraction to
[26:28] her body I must love her because I'm
[26:30] attracted to her body Love Goes deeper
[26:33] than that
[26:36] because the problem with an attraction
[26:37] to a body and you're calling it love
[26:40] your body is made that it can be
[26:43] attracted to the next girl that's pretty
[26:45] as well
[26:47] so there's no committedness in that
[26:49] because you could be attracted to her
[26:51] beauty and say I think I really love her
[26:53] I do love her but a week later your body
[26:56] can be just as attracted to another
[26:57] woman
[26:59] come on now say Amen
[27:01] so no no no you're dealing with an
[27:03] attraction you're doing and so now love
[27:05] young people you're writing it down or
[27:07] you're putting in your mind love has
[27:09] honor to it and if it doesn't have honor
[27:11] it's not true love love has respect for
[27:13] that other individual love has respect
[27:16] and obedience to God and authorities
[27:17] love is rooted in truth love is not
[27:20] rooted in lies or sneaking around that's
[27:22] not love love goes deeper than sexual or
[27:25] natural attraction
[27:28] so if you're going to go about it you've
[27:30] got to know what love is you got to know
[27:32] what love is and if you start using the
[27:34] term which I love you is Loosely used
[27:37] very quickly in all kinds of situations
[27:40] I encourage my kids and our young people
[27:43] I love to talk to young people we're
[27:45] still doing it here brother Kyle brother
[27:47] Brandon brother Boaz whoever's helped us
[27:49] through the years we we keep laying
[27:52] these things into the young people
[27:53] because we feel it's our duty but we're
[27:55] going to let you know what true love is
[27:56] we're going to let you know how to go a
[27:58] bit about courtship we're going to keep
[28:00] saying it and we're going to actually
[28:01] say it even more in the generation we
[28:04] live in
[28:05] when your kids grow up in this church
[28:07] get ready because they're going to hear
[28:09] good solid teaching on it whether they
[28:11] get a hold of her or not is up to them
[28:12] but they're going to hear it because I
[28:15] feel I love to talk about uh next week
[28:17] when I go I love to go to youth camps
[28:18] and talk about it as much as I can I
[28:20] can't go very much today but it's an
[28:22] exciting thing to go talk about and one
[28:24] of the things is that do you understand
[28:26] what love is and we're finding more and
[28:28] more that the term is so weakened that
[28:31] they're using it right away after a few
[28:34] days
[28:35] uh I love you
[28:39] mom
[28:40] with nothing to back it up
[28:44] not a thing to back up that love
[28:48] I love you can we pee together sexually
[28:50] love has honor
[28:53] love has respect boy girl you don't
[28:56] respect them so you don't have love for
[28:58] them what you're reading is love has
[29:01] nothing to do with love
[29:05] so remember that first point and then he
[29:08] thinks he's in love but the Bible says
[29:10] he was vexed
[29:12] so you kind of wonder why is this what's
[29:15] going on here that he he was vexed that
[29:18] he felt sick for his sister Tamar for
[29:20] she was a virgin and so we'll stop right
[29:22] there because the he says he loves her
[29:25] but he's vexed to me that's an oxymoron
[29:28] I mean you're not in love and vexed
[29:30] because vexation means annoyed at
[29:33] somebody frustrated worried it's the
[29:37] cause of trouble vexation trouble
[29:40] Afflicted in some places in the
[29:42] Scripture it returns to him being vexed
[29:45] with the Devil
[29:47] it's tied to Demons Solomon uses the
[29:50] term quite a bit in Ecclesiastes quite a
[29:51] bit vexation of spirit he said I've got
[29:54] all the riches of the world but I've
[29:55] seen he said life is Vanity life is
[29:58] Vanity and vexation of spirit life
[30:01] without God is vexation of spirit
[30:04] it's constant worry it's a lack of peace
[30:07] it's attention it's demonic power
[30:10] holding attention that's being vexed and
[30:13] so his love he was vexed all the time
[30:15] and he fell sick this is what amnon did
[30:17] he had no peace in it his vexation even
[30:20] turned into physically being sick some
[30:23] young people become so emotionally and
[30:26] physically fragile over a relationship
[30:28] they become suicidal if they break up
[30:31] with me I'm crashing or the parents
[30:34] think they're going to crash
[30:36] I can tell you that relationship is
[30:38] based on the wrong thing
[30:40] because it's their their relationship is
[30:43] not in the Lord because if they're based
[30:45] by the Holy Ghost and the Lord they can
[30:47] break up and they're not going to crash
[30:49] and be suicidal because their first
[30:51] relationship is the Lord can I get an
[30:53] amen tonight if if they can crash and be
[30:57] suicidal from an Earthly relationship
[30:59] I've got to have this boy I gotta have
[31:00] this girl there's something wrong in
[31:02] their spirit and that is not love and
[31:04] don't you ever parents don't you parents
[31:05] ever call that love
[31:08] that's emotional fragile over a
[31:11] relationship they become suicidal
[31:13] sometimes infatuation can turn into
[31:15] Obsession and with amnon it had turned
[31:17] into a session
[31:19] and so the second point I want to make
[31:21] to you young people is being vexed in
[31:25] your spirit for the opposite sex is
[31:27] never of God
[31:30] provides peace
[31:33] if the relationship is right
[31:36] there's no condemnation there's no guilt
[31:41] a pastor tell me he says the reason I
[31:43] teach the young people I teach them
[31:45] basically this guilt-free living
[31:49] in Jesus Christ
[31:50] because everything you go do and sneaky
[31:53] and sin guilt goes with it so you got to
[31:56] sin but then you got guilt too and the
[31:58] devil jumps on the guilt and you'll be
[32:00] condemned for years unless you bring it
[32:02] to the cross and true repentance he's
[32:04] going to Badger you for years with that
[32:05] guilt so guilt-free living is like stay
[32:08] in the boundaries and the confines of
[32:10] God's weight and word in his protection
[32:12] why so you can ward off the guilt that
[32:15] comes in your life
[32:16] be in vexed in your spirit for the
[32:18] opposite sex is never of God God
[32:21] provides peace if a relationship is
[32:24] right one of the scriptures I use early
[32:26] on in my relationship with with a girl
[32:29] that I had proverbs 10 22 and I used it
[32:32] I used it with my wife the blessing of
[32:35] the Lord they don't have this up here
[32:37] I'll put it up maybe Sunday the blessing
[32:40] of the Lord it maketh Rich how many
[32:42] wants to be under the blessing of the
[32:43] Lord
[32:44] just half of us all right okay it's fine
[32:47] the blessing of the Lord maketh rich
[32:50] and he addeth no sorrow with it
[32:58] if you want the blessings of the Lord in
[32:59] your relationship
[33:01] if it's of the Lord and he's blessing it
[33:02] he addeth no sorrow with it there's no
[33:05] lack of peace and vexation of spirit
[33:07] there's no Obsession there's no I gotta
[33:10] make this happen there's none of that
[33:11] that's not love that's vexation of the
[33:14] spirit that's a get the job done as
[33:16] quickly as possible
[33:20] all right so remember that one be being
[33:23] vaccine your spirit for the opposite sex
[33:24] is not of God God provides peace if a
[33:27] relationship is right all you older
[33:29] people say amen anyway you know this is
[33:30] truth anyway even this though some of
[33:33] the things apply to us
[33:35] can you say man some of these things
[33:36] apply to married people
[33:39] principles of God's word are for all of
[33:41] us can you say Amen
[33:44] so here's the next thing in the
[33:46] Scripture it says that he was he was uh
[33:50] Vex he felt sick for his sister Tamar
[33:54] for she was a virgin and amnon thought
[33:57] it hard for him to do anything to her
[34:00] stop
[34:02] it was hard to get to her
[34:04] because he wanted to do something to her
[34:08] he asked the question why what kind of
[34:11] mind is wanting to do something to her
[34:15] but he can't because she's around the
[34:17] hedges of her protection
[34:20] so now the mind's going to try to think
[34:22] of a way to get around the boundaries of
[34:25] protection what kind of mind is that
[34:27] it's not of God
[34:32] so it's the part of his frustration he
[34:34] could not get to her he had come to a
[34:37] place that he wanted to get to her and
[34:38] do something to her his mind had reached
[34:40] a point that he wanted to do something
[34:42] to her sexually he was vexed with a
[34:45] lustful eye and a heart towards Tamar
[34:47] but the pitiful thing is he's seen it
[34:50] was hard to get to her it was
[34:53] frustrating it was annoying I can't I
[34:55] want to do something to her and I can't
[34:57] get to her and was looking for ways to
[35:00] get around this huge protective
[35:02] boundaries Godly things in place in
[35:07] Tamar's life normal things that protect
[35:10] our lives can I say it that the word of
[35:13] God is Not only given us Doctrine but is
[35:16] get us give us tons of boundaries and
[35:20] protection to keep our life safe from
[35:23] the temptation of the enemy and where
[35:26] are they at they're laying in this Bible
[35:29] and God gave them to you
[35:31] you live in a world that ignores all of
[35:33] them says they're not important I say
[35:35] they're still important today
[35:38] children of Israel people today whoever
[35:40] it is God says in that generation I'll
[35:42] not only reveal truths of Doctrine but
[35:44] I'm going to give my people some
[35:46] guidelines to live by
[35:48] because they're going to live in this
[35:49] present world
[35:51] and he said my desire is that you live
[35:54] soberly and godly in this present world
[35:59] didn't he say he says a man will be
[36:02] tempted but with every temptation
[36:05] I will make a way of Escape
[36:09] you ought to hold on to that promise and
[36:11] you ought to hold on to the way that he
[36:13] helps you escape the Temptation when he
[36:16] gives it to you
[36:18] and for me most of it is being in the
[36:19] word of God so now if you're in the word
[36:22] he says with every temptation
[36:25] temptation is common to man he says but
[36:27] I promise you in every Temptation
[36:29] there's going to be something come to
[36:30] you there's going to be a scripture come
[36:32] to you there's going to be something
[36:33] planted in you
[36:35] I'll Make A Way and that's your way out
[36:37] a lot of people don't take the the
[36:38] ticket out
[36:40] they ignore it they ignore even if
[36:42] they're healing a voice saying well
[36:43] brother Paul taught that or I read that
[36:45] in the Bible I've been taught this since
[36:46] my youth this and it's all coming up and
[36:48] it's screaming sometimes it's screaming
[36:50] at you if you haven't squelched those
[36:51] voices
[36:52] and still young people will override it
[36:55] and say I want this lustful thing
[36:58] God has put boundaries in place and he
[37:00] put that around Tamar and Hamden was
[37:03] trying to think of a way to gather when
[37:04] we start allowing our minds to think in
[37:06] ways to bust down the fences God has put
[37:09] up with his word we're on Dangerous
[37:11] Ground
[37:14] I said when we let our minds start
[37:17] thinking of ways to bust down the fences
[37:20] that God has put up with his word we're
[37:23] on Dangerous Ground
[37:28] it's not a very shouting service tonight
[37:31] we're not going to be doing a Victory
[37:32] lap probably not
[37:35] but it is every bit the truth
[37:38] it is every bit the truth when our minds
[37:40] start to think of ways to bust down the
[37:42] fences God has put up his word or on
[37:43] dangerous crown
[37:46] and then you hear I don't like the
[37:48] boundaries anymore I don't like that
[37:49] that I can't have her
[37:51] it's so hard to do what we want to do
[37:53] and everybody's making it so hard we
[37:55] just want to do this and everybody's
[37:57] making it so hard it's a hard way to
[37:59] live this way of the message it's too
[38:00] hard I can't do it I feel restricted by
[38:03] the boundaries I can't get what I want
[38:04] well there's the problem right there
[38:06] it's what you want I can't get what I
[38:08] want I can't wear what I want in this
[38:09] message I can't even wear what I want
[38:11] because because of what the message says
[38:13] and it goes It goes on this this reveals
[38:16] what is in this guy's mind and sisters
[38:20] young girls listen to me and young guys
[38:22] with girls nobody could see what was in
[38:26] amnon's mind we don't see what the
[38:29] thinking process is that boy that you
[38:31] see or that girl that you see we only
[38:33] see the physical first
[38:39] so we judge them physically then we get
[38:42] to know them we judge their personality
[38:43] I kind of like their personality it
[38:45] takes a while to see what's in that mind
[38:48] young girls you ought to wait a long
[38:51] time to see because it won't take you
[38:53] too long it'll start spilling out what
[38:56] mind what does this guy think about
[38:58] because as a man thinketh
[39:01] so is he
[39:04] so if you judge the first week in town
[39:05] you love him the first week
[39:07] guy if you're judged by you're just
[39:09] judged quickly I love her you know I
[39:11] love her I love her right you don't know
[39:12] what that's in in that girl's mind
[39:14] you don't know her
[39:16] so I'm encouraging young people young
[39:18] guys and young girls I'm encouraging you
[39:20] that's why we encourage taking time
[39:22] because you don't know what's in their
[39:23] mind yet you don't know if they have the
[39:25] Holy Ghost until you know that they have
[39:27] the Holy Ghost and when you know they
[39:29] have the Holy Ghost then you start to
[39:31] know what's in their mind because uh
[39:33] what they've been feeding on it's going
[39:35] to come out
[39:36] this came out what amnon had been
[39:39] feeding on came out
[39:41] in a bad a bad a
[39:43] and I think girls and guys should look
[39:45] because nobody can see what's in that
[39:48] person's mind guys and girls look past
[39:49] the physical and the Winsome Looks To
[39:53] Die For and he's so hot and she's so hot
[39:56] and
[39:57] wait and see over time
[40:01] and you will see what's in their mind
[40:02] and heart who he really is
[40:07] and who she really is so my third point
[40:10] to you any boy
[40:13] any boy or girl who is trying to push
[40:15] back god-given boundaries and protection
[40:19] is not to be trusted
[40:23] if you could take this girls
[40:26] and
[40:27] get you a magic marker and write it on
[40:30] your purse or something I don't know
[40:33] even this one any boy or girl who's
[40:34] trying to push back the god-given
[40:37] boundaries that's been laid in your
[40:38] hearts for all these years
[40:40] push back the boundaries and get around
[40:42] the protections that's a boy not to be
[40:44] trusted that's a girl not to be trusted
[40:52] so the next point is that
[40:57] he thought it hard for her to get to
[40:58] verse three but you don't have to go to
[41:00] the scriptures if you're reading along
[41:02] with me the next thing the next point I
[41:03] want to make
[41:04] is but amnon had a friend
[41:08] whose name was Jonah dab
[41:12] the son of shimia David's brother and
[41:15] Jonah dab
[41:16] it wasn't just a friend but was a very
[41:19] subtle man
[41:20] interesting word that comes from the
[41:23] fall in the Garden of Eden that the
[41:25] serpent was more subtle than any beast
[41:28] of the field
[41:29] and so this Jonah dab
[41:32] somehow became the friend of amnon and
[41:35] he was subtle
[41:37] wrong kind of friend to have
[41:41] animal not only had a mind that was
[41:44] perverted and messed up he also chose
[41:46] the wrong type of friend young people
[41:48] are you listening
[41:50] if you got a mind that's messed up and
[41:52] then you choose the wrong friends of
[41:53] course if your mind is messed up you're
[41:55] going to choose the wrong friends
[41:56] uh you got a double whammy going against
[42:00] you Amna not only had a mind perverted
[42:02] and messed up he also chose the wrong
[42:04] friend I think the definition of a
[42:06] friend today has been watered down
[42:14] you got a lot of friends on social media
[42:17] that you don't even know
[42:19] how did that become friends we don't
[42:21] even know him
[42:24] I think the definition of friend has
[42:26] been watered down we make choices now to
[42:28] follow somebody and we don't even know
[42:30] them we follow them I'm going to follow
[42:31] them and follow them
[42:34] we befriend someone to follow them and
[42:37] then we friend them and then we unfriend
[42:39] them and then we block someone and then
[42:42] we follow people that we don't know we
[42:44] follow an influencer I'm going to join
[42:46] them I'm going to follow them be a
[42:48] follower of them no check of their life
[42:50] or anything else you don't even know
[42:52] them Harley from Sam and you're
[42:54] following them on the Internet
[42:58] it's all based upon whatever you feel of
[43:00] the time and when when you get lost in
[43:02] all this true meaning of what a real
[43:04] friendship is now you choose the wrong
[43:06] friends you don't choose the correct
[43:08] type of friend young people are you
[43:10] listening
[43:11] and the top people to follow on Tic Tac
[43:14] are called influencers
[43:16] and uh
[43:18] they're the most popular they're the
[43:19] most and so relationships then I've said
[43:22] before become really shallow these days
[43:24] social networks like Facebook Twitter
[43:26] Instagram
[43:28] make regular users more shallow and less
[43:30] moral this is what the psychologists say
[43:33] these all make the users of it more
[43:36] shallow in their friendships and less
[43:38] moral than what they were before how can
[43:41] so you do that well it's happening we
[43:43] got the fruit there it makes young
[43:45] people less moral than they were before
[43:48] according to a new study by
[43:50] psychologists because social media sites
[43:52] often lead to fast and short responses
[43:55] it is a it is a killing the art of
[43:58] reflective thought researchers said you
[44:01] don't think about it you just choose
[44:02] that friend you follow them and whatever
[44:04] they're doing you're just obsessed with
[44:06] it and you go into it betrayal is
[44:08] everywhere there's more friends but
[44:10] there are more shallow friendships
[44:11] there's less deep relationship trust is
[44:14] broken Satan exploits our Satan exploits
[44:17] our pure desire and thirst for friends
[44:19] and points us to the wrong friends you
[44:22] have a thirst in you to have friends you
[44:24] have a desire to have true friends but
[44:26] Satan exploits that and puts you on
[44:29] there to people to make your friends or
[44:31] sometimes even within a church that's
[44:33] not the right friend and so he exploits
[44:35] your desire for a true right friend and
[44:38] you settle for second best and you form
[44:41] a friendship with the wrong one
[44:45] I want to say that because of petrayum
[44:47] because of loneliness in young people's
[44:49] lives people feel their desire for
[44:52] friendship and social media and games
[44:53] and other things and choosing not
[44:56] choosing the right friends they escape
[44:57] into movies and phones and books they
[45:00] don't really need people anymore they
[45:01] don't need to be face to face with
[45:03] anymore they don't need to be in the
[45:05] word anymore hours are spent playing
[45:07] video games hours are spent on the phone
[45:09] that becomes your friend almost uh and
[45:13] marriages have been lost because of that
[45:14] I know marriages that have ended because
[45:16] someone else becomes their friend on the
[45:18] internet because their wife is not their
[45:20] friend anymore
[45:23] animals become more important than the
[45:25] people in their lives oh I shouldn't
[45:27] have said that
[45:30] one Minister that you know and I think
[45:32] he said it was at our church years ago
[45:34] he was a latchkey kid he came home and
[45:35] his mom was never home until later he
[45:38] became lonely as ever and he says that
[45:40] home he says home became his video games
[45:43] Holmes became pornography because he
[45:45] didn't have a home he had a house but A
[45:48] House Is Not a Home and he didn't have
[45:49] that relationship with his parents in a
[45:51] relationship with his siblings and he
[45:53] didn't have that thing to come home to
[45:55] to make it a home if we don't have a
[45:57] good home to come home to then
[45:58] pornography becomes our home the wrong
[46:01] friendships becomes our home
[46:03] oh
[46:05] if you pour yourself into that it
[46:07] becomes subtle and you're filling a need
[46:09] for True friendships with the wrong
[46:11] friends I wonder if it becomes subtle a
[46:13] subtle friend like amnon subtle friend
[46:15] here uh and and so this is how the path
[46:18] that we go down so here we pick up amnon
[46:21] wondering if we can answer why a boy in
[46:24] a royal family would carry out such an
[46:26] act as this with Tamar
[46:33] amnon's mind was given over to
[46:36] standards against what he had been
[46:39] taught
[46:41] the story is very revealing to show that
[46:44] with the slow decline in his thinking
[46:47] through whatever he was feeding on
[46:50] top of that he has a friend in his life
[46:52] and becomes a subtle friend
[46:55] and amnon could never go around the
[46:57] barriers to have this girl that he
[46:58] wanted
[46:59] but he finally made it through and the
[47:01] whole incident would not could have been
[47:04] stopped but it wasn't
[47:05] he could have got on right track you
[47:07] know what amnon could have got on the
[47:09] right track and get his mind cleared up
[47:11] if he'd been around the right friends
[47:14] the story would have read different
[47:17] his mind was messed up but if he got
[47:19] around the presence of God
[47:21] good people good older people some good
[47:23] young people and the right kind of
[47:26] friends this may not have happened
[47:28] but a combination of two of them it was
[47:31] just it created the wrong situation
[47:34] amen I need to pass some of this and get
[47:36] down to it here
[47:42] James chapter 4 says from whence come
[47:44] Wars and fightings among you come they
[47:47] not hints even of your lusts were war in
[47:49] your that war in your members ye lost
[47:51] and have not ye kill and desire to have
[47:53] and cannot obtain you fight and War yet
[47:57] you have not because ye ask not ye asked
[48:00] and receive not because you ask a mess
[48:01] that you may consume it upon your lust
[48:04] ye adulterers and adulteresses know ye
[48:06] not that the Friendship of the world is
[48:10] enmity with God
[48:13] whosoever there shall whosoever
[48:15] therefore young people listen to me
[48:18] whoever therefore will be a friend of
[48:21] the world is the enemy of God
[48:25] you can't have the best of both worlds
[48:28] you can't keep wrong friendships and be
[48:31] in relationship with God
[48:34] it doesn't work that way
[48:37] so in order to have the right friends
[48:39] you must know how subtle your enemy is
[48:41] and that you must choose the right
[48:43] friends Point number four out of this
[48:46] lesson you must purpose that you can
[48:48] never have a close intimate relationship
[48:50] with someone who rejects your Christ or
[48:54] the convictions and principles you live
[48:56] by
[48:57] if they reject them they are really
[49:00] rejecting you
[49:02] maybe it hasn't happened yet
[49:04] but
[49:06] I got to tell you you know the story
[49:09] the moment this was over
[49:11] his love changed to anger
[49:15] and he ditched her out of the room
[49:19] hated her
[49:21] which which doesn't mean he loved her
[49:23] because how can you love her and then
[49:24] you hate her after the moment that you
[49:27] get and fulfilled your lust honor
[49:31] so you must purpose young people that
[49:33] you can never have a close intimate
[49:35] relationship with someone who rejects
[49:38] your Christ or convictions and
[49:39] principles you live by you should never
[49:42] have a close friendship like that
[49:43] acquaintances be cordial be nice but
[49:47] never form bonds with somebody who
[49:49] rejects your Christ or disrespect your
[49:51] Christ or disrespects your convictions I
[49:54] had some friends in school but they
[49:55] respected my convictions
[49:58] but the devil works on somebody and you
[50:00] form a close relationship with somebody
[50:02] who's mocking your convictions and
[50:03] trying to get you to wiggle around them
[50:06] that is not friendship that's not the
[50:07] friends that God has provided for you
[50:11] brother Brian says friendship is a gift
[50:13] from God
[50:14] so do you want God's gifts to you or do
[50:16] you want your own friends that you've
[50:18] chosen I want God's gifts to me and
[50:21] guess what you may have very few in this
[50:23] life
[50:24] but I would rather have few
[50:27] than to have too many wrong ones
[50:30] in my loneliness I would rather have
[50:33] few friendships that are solid
[50:36] and feel a bit lonely sometimes
[50:39] than to have many that are wrong
[50:42] the last point is
[50:44] amnon and his friend conceived the plan
[50:47] to draw Tamar out of her protected world
[50:49] out of the protection and headship of
[50:52] her parents into being in a place alone
[50:54] with him
[50:55] into amnon's private world and I wish I
[50:58] had another hour to preach on this we'll
[51:00] pick it up Sunday again
[51:02] he drew her out in other words a girl
[51:04] can draw a girl can woo somebody out of
[51:09] their world not just physically but he
[51:11] can woo you out of the world of
[51:12] protection that you used to around the
[51:14] grace of God around the things of God
[51:17] the wrong girl can woo a guy out of that
[51:20] draw her by her looks or whatever her
[51:23] you know you go into Proverbs that
[51:24] describes perfectly her attire of a
[51:27] harlot any way she does you know I've
[51:28] I've decked my bed with tapestry she
[51:31] changed her whole bed and it's all a
[51:33] fantasy it's like Disney World that's
[51:35] not the way her bed normally looks
[51:38] but she changes it all because that's a
[51:40] fantasy I've done all this for you come
[51:42] into my and so uh a girl can woo
[51:46] somebody and a guy can lose somebody by
[51:49] a lot of different ways and if they're
[51:52] willing you out of the protection and
[51:54] boundaries God has provided for you and
[51:56] he this boy he he wound her into his
[51:59] private world something should be said
[52:01] before I close about this being a danger
[52:05] zone
[52:06] your private world
[52:11] never ever in history have a people been
[52:16] able to be drawn into their own private
[52:19] World outside of any accountability or
[52:22] any eyes to watch you never before in
[52:26] history do we have the ability to do
[52:28] that like we do now
[52:30] no zero accountability and zero eyes to
[52:34] watch what you're doing
[52:37] well I'm an adult I can do that I can go
[52:40] to an adult place
[52:42] principles of the word don't change for
[52:44] a 60 year old and a 16 year old
[52:48] they don't change
[52:51] and and so now never in history has
[52:54] there been such a moving into your
[52:56] private world it's none of your business
[52:58] this is what I can look at I have a
[53:01] right I have an American right and the
[53:03] whole scriptures again it against it
[53:05] because we realize that first of all
[53:09] there's no place that we can live that
[53:12] God doesn't see us
[53:13] how stupid to think that you have your
[53:16] own private World guess what you don't
[53:18] have a private world you don't have a
[53:21] place where all I see
[53:23] I always can't see
[53:24] there is an eye watching you
[53:28] so accountability to God and
[53:30] accountability to eyes and
[53:31] accountability to boundaries is the
[53:34] scriptural way the Nev That Never Ends
[53:37] I'm 57 I don't want that to end and if
[53:39] it ever would it's it's a weakening if
[53:42] we change that principle I don't want
[53:44] that accountability to ever end I've
[53:46] lived with accountability man I've I
[53:48] want more accountability in my life I
[53:50] want to call people and run things
[53:52] across them I don't live in my own
[53:54] private world I want to be submissive he
[53:56] said pastors congregations submit
[53:59] yourself to your pastor Pastor submit
[54:01] yourself to your congregation I want
[54:03] another accountable in all things that
[54:05] we do here okay that's I want to
[54:07] continue to live that way I want to live
[54:09] that way anymore because that's the way
[54:10] the Bible tells us to live and there's
[54:12] no age that stops that
[54:15] it's all right it's all right you can be
[54:17] quiet that's fine
[54:18] the private world of and say this before
[54:21] I get to my final fifth Point there's
[54:23] five more points and I'm saving them for
[54:25] Sunday aren't you glad to hear it I'm
[54:27] only doing five tonight
[54:28] try to come back Sunday if you want if
[54:30] you don't you know but I'm gonna get I'm
[54:32] gonna get to these other five points and
[54:34] they are more positive strengths than
[54:36] weaknesses all right the other five the
[54:38] positive things that Tamar is offering
[54:40] up to this boy
[54:41] all right and so now I want to get to
[54:44] the fifth point but I'm saying this that
[54:47] in the private world of texting and
[54:49] Instagram and many others give young
[54:53] people and adults places that they can
[54:56] say things
[55:00] watch things
[55:02] hear things that they would never
[55:04] normally say or look at in front of
[55:08] others
[55:11] so it can't be of God
[55:12] can't be of God
[55:15] what does it do it's it's what Satan has
[55:18] brought to weaken you
[55:21] to weaken you in your private world
[55:24] so private world is not of God
[55:26] because why it weakens you
[55:30] God's calling and young people to be
[55:32] strong
[55:34] strong in convictions
[55:36] strong in what they stand for strong in
[55:38] the Holy Ghost young girls that are
[55:40] strong in their conventions strong in
[55:41] the Holy Ghost filled with the holy
[55:43] spirit that the word is is a guidance to
[55:47] their life it's not just some Sunday
[55:48] morning thing but the word is guiding
[55:50] their lives God is calling young people
[55:53] to be strong
[55:55] in the midst of Satan's Eden the texting
[55:57] and all these other things I have to say
[55:59] it again brings Youth and adults in
[56:02] places they can say things watch things
[56:05] and hear things that they never would
[56:06] normally say in front of others
[56:09] him up sometimes I see an Instagram or
[56:11] something like that and go wow did they
[56:14] actually say that did they post that did
[56:16] they wear that
[56:17] they'd never wear that at church and
[56:19] they go to my church
[56:23] and so then we might as well say that uh
[56:26] it encourages a boy or girl to get
[56:30] really good at living in Two Worlds
[56:34] because you got your private world and
[56:36] then you got your church life world
[56:39] so is it right to be living in Two
[56:41] Worlds absolutely not
[56:43] you're living in Two Worlds you're
[56:44] two-faced book
[56:48] you're being two different people
[56:52] you're a person to everybody at church
[56:55] but privately you're a completely
[56:56] different person
[57:00] this is what the world encourages this
[57:01] is the World by the way it's the wisdom
[57:03] of the world it gives you permission to
[57:05] be that way to put on something to
[57:07] somebody else but I think we should be
[57:09] who we are and if you want to be like
[57:11] the world I'm not encouraging you to do
[57:13] that I'm encouraging not to be two
[57:15] people
[57:16] can I get an amen tonight I'm standing
[57:19] here as a gospel Minister don't do both
[57:21] don't be lukewarm get in or get out can
[57:23] you say man I'm encouraging you to don't
[57:26] ever be two people don't be lukewarm
[57:28] don't be something at church you put on
[57:30] something holy but your heart is not in
[57:32] it don't be what Jesus said my they
[57:34] honor honorary with my lit their lips
[57:36] but their heart is far from me no if
[57:38] you're gonna do this sell out Lock Stock
[57:41] and Barrel through repentance and say
[57:43] I'm all in I believe this I'm not two
[57:45] people what you see in church is what
[57:47] you see in my bedroom what you see here
[57:49] is what you see at home
[57:52] can I get an amen I'm not two people
[57:55] this is who I am
[57:58] culture provides us a place to be two
[58:02] different worlds so Tamar was drawn out
[58:06] of her world of boundaries and
[58:07] protections to a world alone with her
[58:09] what time is it 8 8 22.
[58:13] all right
[58:14] Tamar was Drew out of her world
[58:17] and her boundaries and her protections
[58:19] to a world all alone with him and I have
[58:22] never
[58:23] been fond of guys or girls being alone
[58:26] together until they have matured and
[58:29] grown into a courtship a little while
[58:31] that's been my principle now I don't
[58:33] have any
[58:33] straight things from the message on that
[58:35] but I do have bib Bible here
[58:38] I do have the Hebrew law
[58:42] that says that
[58:46] two people should not be alone together
[58:48] in a room alone
[58:50] and that was the law that was married
[58:52] people should never be in the room alone
[58:55] not that they would do anything but the
[58:57] temptation to do something
[58:59] so you just put the law there don't be
[59:01] together alone in a room
[59:03] when this rate took place David enhanced
[59:08] the law and said two single young people
[59:11] from here on out should not be alone
[59:14] him and the priests changed it for this
[59:16] incident
[59:17] just expanded it
[59:19] so I made a I'm going to expand it just
[59:22] a little bit more and I say until
[59:24] they've matured or come into their
[59:26] courtship a little while and we see
[59:28] where their hearts are I don't encourage
[59:30] my kids to be alone with the opposite
[59:33] sex under any circumstances
[59:36] there's a time it'll come
[59:40] it will come but never just within right
[59:44] away no it's like you know it's not a
[59:47] good thing
[59:48] why it has proved to be dangerous ground
[59:50] and thousands of incidences if not
[59:53] millions in fact with kids
[59:55] it's happened to pretty decent kids
[59:58] pretty decent kids
[1:00:00] and all they did was go out too long
[1:00:02] alone together and decent kids
[1:00:04] found that their flesh took over and
[1:00:06] they messed up
[1:00:08] amen
[1:00:10] so they did fine in a group but too much
[1:00:14] alone opened the doors they didn't have
[1:00:16] the Holy Ghost didn't have strong
[1:00:18] convictions to keep things holy and just
[1:00:21] went South
[1:00:24] most parents tonight
[1:00:26] most parents tonight should be in
[1:00:29] agreement with with me
[1:00:32] if you grew up in the world I have a lot
[1:00:34] of appearances to open the world and
[1:00:36] they didn't do everything right they
[1:00:38] didn't know about the word and some of
[1:00:39] me in the group The Message made
[1:00:41] mistakes but then when they hear this
[1:00:42] preachers a lot of parents are saying
[1:00:44] preach it brother Bo preach it preaching
[1:00:47] barefisted tell it like it is and by the
[1:00:50] way I'm doing that tonight
[1:00:52] preaching parents just right behind we
[1:00:55] wish we could have heard this don't stop
[1:00:58] preaching it but it's amazing how some
[1:01:01] parents even when they messed up when
[1:01:04] they were young
[1:01:06] won't stand behind you
[1:01:09] and the guidelines from the message are
[1:01:11] devalued
[1:01:13] they're not important they're not
[1:01:15] relevant anymore
[1:01:18] brother Brown got towards the end of his
[1:01:19] ministry and started to say things that
[1:01:21] like science has proved that the sex
[1:01:24] glands your sex glands the same sex
[1:01:27] glands are in the lips
[1:01:29] so when you kiss a girl before marriage
[1:01:31] you potentially commit adultery with her
[1:01:33] start to say that 64-65 so don't kiss
[1:01:36] her he said till you're at the altar
[1:01:37] until you marry her
[1:01:39] he laid that in there a lot of people
[1:01:42] were following the message for years and
[1:01:43] had already kissed you know and it's
[1:01:45] like he's making adjustments kind of
[1:01:47] like David making that enhancement of
[1:01:49] the law saying hey we need this in place
[1:01:50] let me ask you a question he said that
[1:01:52] in 64-65 introduced that totally new oh
[1:01:56] boy that's the legalism that's just
[1:01:57] we're not doing that but let me ask you
[1:02:00] this question in the world you live in
[1:02:02] now was that a good principle to put in
[1:02:04] place for the young people
[1:02:08] it's exactly God breathing in the mouth
[1:02:11] of a prophet through the mouth of a
[1:02:12] prophet it's saying my young people are
[1:02:15] going to need some standards
[1:02:17] in this Satan's Eden so I'll breathe
[1:02:21] through my prophet and say
[1:02:23] don't touch her sexually and don't kiss
[1:02:26] her until your wedding day
[1:02:29] yeah when you raise your hand say we
[1:02:30] needed that
[1:02:32] 99 of the world is going to reject that
[1:02:34] and laugh at me tonight if they get it
[1:02:36] hear it they're going to laugh
[1:02:38] unfortunately some message people are
[1:02:39] going to laugh I've heard it said that
[1:02:41] somebody said well is that really
[1:02:42] reality to expect that the kids and
[1:02:44] times we live in
[1:02:46] God have mercy on you for saying that
[1:02:49] yeah it's a reality it's not your
[1:02:51] reality it's the reality of the word of
[1:02:52] God
[1:02:54] yes it's still real reality it's the
[1:02:56] word of God it's the message of the hour
[1:02:58] and we teach it and preach it here
[1:03:01] maybe God give us young people that will
[1:03:02] follow it can you say Amen the
[1:03:04] guidelines for the message are devalued
[1:03:06] in in so many ways but but we're
[1:03:08] preaching those things so my last point
[1:03:10] and number five and we'll bring it to a
[1:03:12] close tonight any guy or girl that draws
[1:03:14] someone else away from accountability
[1:03:16] and protection
[1:03:18] into being alone too much is not the
[1:03:21] right guy or the girl for you
[1:03:24] this applies even to private messages in
[1:03:28] private messages if he's drawing you out
[1:03:30] of the protection of your what you
[1:03:33] believe and what you stood for or for
[1:03:36] your what your church stands for or what
[1:03:38] your your parents is dead or any guy or
[1:03:40] girl that's not the right guy a girl for
[1:03:42] you
[1:03:43] it's not
[1:03:45] and this applies even to private
[1:03:48] messages can you say Amen
[1:03:50] praise the Lord
[1:03:52] so hey even the youth will become weak
[1:03:56] and faint
[1:03:58] but they that wait on the Lord even the
[1:04:00] youth
[1:04:01] the ones who wait on the Lord shall
[1:04:03] renew their strength
[1:04:05] they shall Mount up as wings as an eagle
[1:04:09] can you say Amen they shall run and not
[1:04:11] be worried they shall walk God give us
[1:04:13] young people that'll run and not be
[1:04:15] weary
[1:04:16] walk and not faint God give us young
[1:04:18] people that's strong God give us a
[1:04:20] church that's strong in the Holy Ghost
[1:04:22] and in the principles of of the word
[1:04:26] notice what happens within seconds of
[1:04:28] being alone
[1:04:30] with a guy like the mind and lustful
[1:04:32] Spirit of amnon within seconds of being
[1:04:34] a once he was in that place he could do
[1:04:37] whatever he wanted to because that's why
[1:04:38] I say when I go into the five things of
[1:04:41] the strength of Tamar
[1:04:43] when he began to force her his her
[1:04:46] responses were the right responses and I
[1:04:49] want to get into those responses they
[1:04:50] were the right responses but I tell you
[1:04:52] even the strength of responses didn't
[1:04:55] work because he was alone
[1:04:58] you see so that's why I've emphasized
[1:05:01] tonight when you're drawn away alone
[1:05:02] into the world without accountability
[1:05:04] that's when you really set yourself up
[1:05:07] for tremendous compromising of all
[1:05:10] convictions and dishonor and disrespect
[1:05:14] and all of that comes when you've placed
[1:05:16] yourself alone with somebody how many
[1:05:19] married brothers and married sisters can
[1:05:21] say the same thing the rules still apply
[1:05:23] for us too no doubt about it no doubt
[1:05:26] about it we live in the same world the
[1:05:28] young people do
[1:05:29] and so these things is God's word that
[1:05:31] he's given us that we can renew our
[1:05:34] strength by these things when we become
[1:05:36] weak in these areas we we look to the
[1:05:39] Lord to renew our strength that we
[1:05:41] become strong young people strong
[1:05:43] marriages how many would raise your
[1:05:45] hands say I want my marriage to be
[1:05:46] stronger not weaker the devil's trying
[1:05:49] to weaken your marriage but I want my
[1:05:50] marriage to be stronger I want my life
[1:05:53] and the Holy Ghost to be stronger I want
[1:05:55] to go to the next level higher with the
[1:05:57] Lord how many young people raise you I
[1:05:59] want to be a stronger young girl
[1:06:01] the right responses to the wrong guy
[1:06:03] amen I believe your heart is pure
[1:06:06] tonight and want those things well
[1:06:07] praise the Lord we'll we'll finish this
[1:06:09] unless the Lord leads me another
[1:06:10] Direction we'll finish this on Sunday
[1:06:12] hopefully you'll come back and I believe
[1:06:15] it'll be good can we stand together and
[1:06:17] pray
[1:06:18] thank you for studying the word with me
[1:06:19] tonight
[1:06:20] God bless you
[1:06:23] Heavenly Father
[1:06:25] Lord I just wanted to share my heart
[1:06:27] tonight in a teaching to the young
[1:06:29] people
[1:06:31] but really all of us Lord as we see the
[1:06:35] weakening brother Danny read that
[1:06:37] scripture of of the our enemy Satan as
[1:06:41] he was exposed in Isaiah
[1:06:44] and when he looked at him he said is
[1:06:47] this the man that caused all the nations
[1:06:49] to tremble and thus weaken the Nations
[1:06:51] is this the one all those years that we
[1:06:54] can look at that Lord It's you're
[1:06:55] showing us that the devil's job is to
[1:06:57] weaken the people and weaken the Nations
[1:07:00] and weaken families and weakened
[1:07:03] convictions and take this message and
[1:07:04] devalue it Lord this message was exactly
[1:07:09] what this generation needed it was just
[1:07:12] what the doctor ordered Lord God I want
[1:07:14] to preach it more than I've ever
[1:07:16] preached it before and I know there's
[1:07:19] influences Lord to devalue it and take
[1:07:21] away from it and and say well just pick
[1:07:24] and choose what we want of it oh God I
[1:07:27] respect it Lord and what you breathe
[1:07:29] through your Prophet to bring us back to
[1:07:31] scriptural ways I want to live it and
[1:07:36] Proclaim it with all of my heart
[1:07:40] I pray for the young people here I pray
[1:07:43] for the young people next week at the
[1:07:45] Youth Camp that's why I taught these
[1:07:46] things tonight Lord I just want to get
[1:07:48] familiar with the subject my heart is to
[1:07:51] teach them Lord if you give it around
[1:07:52] the world wherever they would listen uh
[1:07:55] Lord when we when we train the youth
[1:07:58] we're training for the future
[1:08:00] I pray they'd get a hold of it tonight I
[1:08:02] pray there be a young girl a young guy
[1:08:04] say God dropped this word in my heart
[1:08:09] drop it deeply in there Lord so that in
[1:08:12] the hour of Temptation I've prayed up
[1:08:14] I'm ready I know how to go against the
[1:08:17] enemy I know what his voice is give us
[1:08:20] young people like that give us adults
[1:08:21] and families like that Lord
[1:08:23] that's your promise for this hour we
[1:08:26] thank you for this teaching in the word

[1:08:29] people's lives we pray we ask in Jesus
