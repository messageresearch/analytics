[7:55] [Music]
[8:01] what a wonderful name it is
[8:10] [Music]
[8:14] oh what a wonderful name it is
[8:18] oh nothing compares to this
[8:23] what a wonderful name
[8:27] the name of
[8:30] Jesus
[8:33] Acts chapter 4 and verse 32
[8:36] and the multitude of them that believed
[8:39] were of one heart and of one soul
[8:43] neither said any of them that ought of
[8:46] what things which he possessed was his
[8:48] own but they had all things common and
[8:52] with great power gave the apostles
[8:54] witness of the resurrection of the Lord
[8:56] Jesus and great grace was upon them all
[9:00] neither was any of them that lacked for
[9:03] as many as were possessors of lands or
[9:05] houses sold them and brought the prices
[9:08] of things that were sold and laid them
[9:09] down at the apostles feet and
[9:11] distribution was made unto every man
[9:13] according as he had need and Joseph who
[9:17] was by who by the apostles was surname
[9:19] Barnabas which is being interpreted the
[9:22] son of consolation a levite of the
[9:24] country of Cyprus having land sold it
[9:27] and brought the money and laid it at the
[9:30] apostles feet I want to emphasize verse
[9:33] 32 today as under my text and subject I
[9:37] want to emphasize that this is where the
[9:39] people of God were after
[9:41] the Redemption and the Holy Ghost had
[9:44] come this is the state of mind this is
[9:47] the state of heart is that they were of
[9:49] one heart and of one Soul this is what
[9:52] the Holy Ghost does
[9:54] if you go back to Acts 2 I'll go ahead
[9:56] and read this I'll refer to it later
[9:58] Acts 2 it says a lot of the same thing
[10:01] after writing Acts 2 after the Holy
[10:03] Ghost fell then he Peter directs the
[10:06] people and then it comes down and it
[10:08] says verse 41 Acts 2 41 then they gladly
[10:12] they that gladly received his word how
[10:16] many want to gladly receive his word
[10:17] today
[10:18] them that gladly received his word were
[10:21] baptized and the same day that was added
[10:23] unto them three thousand souls and they
[10:26] continued steadfastly in the apostles
[10:28] Doctrine and fellowship and in Breaking
[10:31] of bread and in prayers and fear Came
[10:35] Upon every soul and Many Wonders and
[10:38] signs were done by the apostles and all
[10:42] that believed were together and had all
[10:46] things common
[10:49] just a few weeks ago we were on a
[10:51] subject of uh relationships after the
[10:55] fall relationships after the fall and we
[10:57] were
[10:58] delving into after everything fell when
[11:02] mankind fell then we know that it wasn't
[11:04] just that they'd fallen in sin but
[11:06] everything in relationships began to
[11:08] fall number one their relationship with
[11:11] God was broken and their Oneness with
[11:14] God was broken and that was the worst
[11:18] tragedy but not just their their
[11:20] relationship with God was broken and
[11:22] became strained and there was a wall
[11:24] between them and God not only the
[11:26] relationship with God but also their
[11:28] relationship with one another in their
[11:30] marriage and from that point on
[11:32] relationships were broken because of the
[11:35] fall of sin and so we elaborated on that
[11:38] talked about the relationships that took
[11:40] place and some of the attributes of
[11:42] Fallen relationships and Fallen things
[11:44] when man is away from God and when man
[11:46] is broken from God and away from God
[11:49] then we realize then he can't be right
[11:51] he can't be what should be life is never
[11:54] correct life is never what it should be
[11:56] when we're not in relationship with God
[11:59] and so we elaborate on that but today I
[12:01] want to pick up the series again as I
[12:04] have just a little unfinished business
[12:05] to talk about because we don't want to
[12:07] leave man after the fall but we want to
[12:10] call talk about relationships after
[12:13] Redemption relationships after
[12:16] Redemption and we want to pick this up
[12:18] again today we we do have some things to
[12:21] look at what this was looking like of of
[12:25] the power of God in people's lives after
[12:28] Calvary after the resurrection and after
[12:31] they were filled with the Holy Ghost and
[12:33] that that we can praise the Lord this
[12:35] morning that the Oneness that was broken
[12:37] at Eden was completely redeemed and
[12:40] restored and begin to express itself
[12:43] after they begin to come out of the
[12:45] upper room everything that was lost in
[12:48] Eden was restored and they come out of
[12:51] that Upper Room with all the power
[12:53] laying within them that had been lost in
[12:56] the Garden of Eden can you say Amen tell
[12:57] you when we have life
[12:59] and when we have what they had in the
[13:02] book of Acts when we have Oneness
[13:05] I'm happy
[13:10] I love church order but Church order
[13:12] without life
[13:13] I don't want that
[13:16] that's getting something that's that's
[13:17] the cart before the horse you have to
[13:19] have the life of Pentecost the life of
[13:22] God the Oneness the relationship with
[13:25] the Lord first
[13:26] it has to be a relationship with the
[13:29] Lord
[13:31] I want the life of what happened in
[13:33] those people I want the Oneness can you
[13:34] say amen I want the relationship that
[13:36] they had with God I want the
[13:38] relationship that they had with one
[13:40] another after Redemption this is what it
[13:42] looks like and it starts right away in
[13:45] our text and says they are of one mind
[13:48] and one heart and brother Brown says
[13:50] that's the Oneness it was pure one mind
[13:52] and one heart and all of a sudden so I'm
[13:55] just going to start elaborating on these
[13:57] these attributes of what it looked like
[13:59] in in um in the days of the book of Acts
[14:06] we have the supernatural manifested
[14:09] we have the life of God in the people we
[14:11] had Oneness
[14:13] we had all those things happening but
[14:15] quite often the supernatural gets
[14:17] emphasized
[14:18] more than the Oneness
[14:21] and quite often I've heard preachers
[14:23] many times
[14:24] bring it down to where that's the full
[14:26] Vindication of the Bride if we have the
[14:30] supernatural working among us and we
[14:32] have prophecies and we have all this
[14:34] going on that's the Vindication that
[14:36] we're the bride and I just want to
[14:37] remind everybody that that's not the
[14:40] full Vindication of the Bride
[14:42] we should always have that God should
[14:44] always be dealing with us our young
[14:46] people need to see the power of God in
[14:48] the Supernatural God but it's not the
[14:51] final Vindication of we the bride
[14:53] because God can honor faith and they can
[14:56] have the supernatural happen out there
[14:58] you can't put God in a box
[15:02] I might lose some of you right here but
[15:04] I'm going to just plunge on ahead you
[15:06] cannot isolate that to being the only
[15:08] Vindication of the Bride it's part of it
[15:10] but it's not the final Vindication they
[15:12] have healings there they have prayer
[15:14] lines they have results
[15:17] because it's our God that does it and he
[15:19] honors faith
[15:21] and I want to remind us as well that
[15:24] before the Oneness of Pentecost came in
[15:26] the Holy Ghost Jesus had already given
[15:30] his disciples power without the Holy
[15:33] Ghost in their soul
[15:35] to pray for the sick and to cast out
[15:38] devils
[15:43] you did remember that right that they
[15:46] had that power
[15:48] to cast out Devils before they had the
[15:51] Holy Ghost but they had no power for
[15:54] Oneness
[15:55] they had Now power to come in Oneness
[15:57] with God they had no power to come in
[15:59] Oneness with one another there was
[16:01] nothing there they couldn't even become
[16:02] one with Christ I'll read a quote in a
[16:04] minute they couldn't even become
[16:05] completely one with Christ they couldn't
[16:07] get on the same page with them they
[16:09] didn't understand why he was leaving
[16:10] they didn't understand the word there
[16:12] was hardly any Revelation there can you
[16:14] say Amen but they could cast out Devils
[16:16] because we know when they came back they
[16:18] rejoiced that even the devils are
[16:20] subject to us
[16:22] without the Holy Ghost
[16:27] so don't make that the final Vindication
[16:30] of the Bride that this is the bride
[16:34] because she can cast out Devils because
[16:36] they were doing that before and you
[16:38] remember the other incident when they
[16:40] come back rejoicing he said don't
[16:42] Rejoice because the devils are subject
[16:44] to you don't just be shouting because
[16:46] devils are being cast out
[16:50] the reason for your worship should not
[16:52] only be prophecies and casting out the
[16:55] devil he said don't Rejoice because the
[16:58] devils are subject Rejoice because your
[17:01] names are written in the Lamb's Book of
[17:03] Life that's our worship
[17:05] here's another thing that that happened
[17:07] that said what they owned
[17:10] all of a sudden something huge changed
[17:12] with the Holy Ghost and with Oneness
[17:15] what they owned they did no longer say
[17:18] this is mine
[17:21] what's mine is mine and what's yours and
[17:24] yours yours is yours
[17:26] let me say it again
[17:28] what's mine is mine I own it what's
[17:32] yours is yours
[17:34] keep it separate leave me alone
[17:36] I have my life you have your life
[17:44] all that gets washed away
[17:48] now I might lose some of you
[17:51] I'm talking about what the book of Acts
[17:53] did in the church to bring Oneness and
[17:56] to bring relationship
[17:59] and it burned out
[18:01] this this isn't this is mine and these
[18:05] are divided this is my stuff that's your
[18:07] stuff and then we can fight over it and
[18:10] then even siblings can say but that's
[18:11] mine and we bring it to the court of mom
[18:13] and dad to settle whose it really is
[18:16] all comes from a fall in nature
[18:21] it speaks of children it speaks of
[18:23] immaturity so it speaks of immaturity
[18:25] say this is mine it speaks of immaturity
[18:28] that's in adults sometimes
[18:32] to act like children
[18:34] and say this is mine
[18:38] this is all mine
[18:40] so it's an attribute of children even if
[18:42] they're adults and I'm here to tell you
[18:45] the the change of the Holy Ghost and
[18:48] Redemption begin to change this is my
[18:51] thing this is mine and so now it's it's
[18:55] now that they begin to consider
[18:58] it common property in other words for
[19:02] the use of all
[19:04] I want to emphasize that this it's not
[19:07] just about property it's not just about
[19:08] what you own but it became common the
[19:11] word common is that
[19:12] you're and you remember as we elaborated
[19:16] on the fall in the beginning
[19:18] the first thing they did after the Falls
[19:20] begin to blame each other
[19:21] they begin to act alone as separate
[19:24] entities Eve began to act alone Adam
[19:26] began to act alone and they begin
[19:29] fighting for themselves to protect their
[19:31] their own selves and blame somebody else
[19:34] and become very selfish they never were
[19:36] that way before but the fall brought in
[19:38] selfishness
[19:40] the fall broke relationships and you
[19:42] cannot have you cannot have decent
[19:44] relationship with selfishness involved
[19:46] you can't have a right marriage with
[19:48] selfishness you got it in your mind this
[19:50] I'm marrying this person they're going
[19:51] to meet all my needs all the needs that
[19:53] I want they're gonna have she gonna do
[19:54] it just this way and you're just on the
[19:57] wrong track buster
[20:00] you know it's to lay down your lives to
[20:03] one another it's saying I'm entering
[20:05] this marriage how can I make their life
[20:07] better how can I meet their needs
[20:10] that's a Christian marriage
[20:13] amen because that came after Redemption
[20:16] and we will get into that what marriage
[20:18] looks like after Redemption we will get
[20:19] into that not today but they considered
[20:22] it common property for the use of all
[20:24] and and after the fall they were blaming
[20:26] one another standing alone in separate
[20:27] entities before they were one with one
[20:29] another Adam was saying this is bone of
[20:31] my bone Flesh of My Flesh she's one with
[20:34] me if she does this I'm a part of her
[20:36] she's a part of me and it's all Oneness
[20:38] after the fall he's saying the woman did
[20:40] this you did it he's protecting himself
[20:43] it came from the fall it comes in our
[20:46] fallen nature
[20:48] and and blaming one another and then he
[20:51] comes to the woman and she blames The
[20:53] Serpent and and so but you see in this
[20:56] book of Acts church friends it was no
[20:58] more it's whatever is mine is theirs
[21:01] whatever happens to them happens to me
[21:04] if there's a need if there's a burden
[21:07] then I have a need and I have a burden
[21:09] if there's a a a a something that's
[21:12] happened to them then it's happened to
[21:14] me because I am one with them we are
[21:17] together in this we have all things
[21:18] common it wasn't just possessions but it
[21:21] was the Holy Spirit amongst the people
[21:23] that there was no big eyes or little use
[21:27] or better people or better dress people
[21:29] or rich or poor see that's the world we
[21:32] live in it's categories of people it's
[21:35] categories the rich the poor the
[21:37] preppies the the Uglies the good
[21:39] lookings it's it's separated us all none
[21:42] of that belongs in the body of Christ
[21:43] it's all things are common and we're all
[21:47] saved by grace they lost us whatever
[21:50] happens to them happens to me because
[21:52] this other person next next if they
[21:55] didn't have churches yet so the event in
[21:56] houses this pretty person sitting on the
[21:58] couch next to my next to me now I'm not
[22:01] trying to look them look at them in the
[22:03] chair and examine where they came from
[22:05] and put them in a category and they're
[22:08] sitting there in that chair and we're
[22:10] sitting there in the same house and and
[22:12] so they're no more were they looking
[22:14] back and said look at what he wears and
[22:16] look at where all this stuff and judging
[22:18] him by the outside I wonder where he
[22:20] comes from and then he starts to share
[22:21] and we prejudge them that was washed
[22:25] away friends washed away
[22:27] because they were together they had all
[22:29] things in common and if he has the Holy
[22:32] Spirit he's just as much a part of God
[22:34] as I'm a part of God
[22:42] I'm not above him because I'm the pastor
[22:45] this young man got baptized last year
[22:47] God has transforming his life I'm no
[22:49] better as a pastor I'm a brother in
[22:51] Christ to this man and he has the same
[22:53] inheritance on the other side as I have
[22:56] the same inheritance
[22:58] so so life our life is shared our
[23:00] possessions it strains that this is
[23:03] brought up
[23:04] uh they didn't view people as being rich
[23:07] and poor anymore
[23:08] whether they were or not it's kind of
[23:10] strange because you would think back in
[23:11] that time most the people were poor more
[23:13] likely they were but there were some
[23:14] rich people
[23:15] um different ones they were rich and it
[23:18] speaks here of of uh
[23:20] Barnabas probably being a richer man
[23:23] selling some of his lands to go to the
[23:25] needs of the people and so there were
[23:27] some rich but more likely it was a lot
[23:29] of it poor so whether or not they were
[23:31] poor or not
[23:33] possessions must have a way of putting
[23:37] people in categories of better or worse
[23:42] possessions
[23:45] can possess us
[23:51] and I read a quote a couple weeks ago or
[23:53] maybe it was last Sunday I'm starting to
[23:55] forget from Sunday to Sunday but you
[23:57] know he said you have a family come into
[23:59] the Lord and they're blessed and they're
[24:01] having family prayer together and
[24:03] they're excited they got life and I'm
[24:04] paraphrasing but he goes on there doing
[24:06] fine and then God gives them a little
[24:07] money God blesses their business and
[24:09] they get this and they get that they get
[24:11] a new car they get a new house they move
[24:14] up he gets a promotion and so all of a
[24:16] sudden if they're not careful now all of
[24:18] a sudden the family prayer goes the life
[24:20] of God goes Church goes everything gets
[24:22] to be laid aside and anybody could do it
[24:25] possessions have a way of possessing us
[24:28] maybe that's why they're mentioned in
[24:30] the book of Acts whether you have a lot
[24:31] of them or whether you don't have a lot
[24:33] of them when the Holy Ghost came to
[24:35] these people possessions were not the
[24:38] most important things so much so they
[24:40] said I'm going to let go of this because
[24:42] there's a need over here I'm going to
[24:43] sell this and I'm going to give the
[24:45] money to help this need
[24:48] that's when it's sacrificial giving
[24:50] possessions have a way of putting people
[24:52] in categories of Better or Worse levels
[24:55] of success we live in a world of levels
[24:57] of success and degrees and and and we
[25:00] measure a person based upon degrees or
[25:03] houses or lands or the kind of car they
[25:07] drive or success that they've been we
[25:09] measure People based upon their gifts
[25:11] that they have we measure people upon
[25:13] their better looks that they have
[25:16] and this is not based upon looks or
[25:19] gifts or successes it's all washed away
[25:24] can you say Amen
[25:27] so they let loose of relation they let
[25:29] loose of all relationships based upon
[25:31] status or position let loose of pride of
[25:33] selfishness they sold things sometimes
[25:35] you have to let go of something that
[25:37] you're holding on to so dearly they sold
[25:39] it maybe that's a good thing the Holy
[25:41] Ghost made them do that many times they
[25:42] just sold it got rid of it they're tied
[25:44] to something you ever seen somebody just
[25:46] so so obsessed and tied to something
[25:48] some possession that they have they're
[25:50] just that's it that's the ultimate that
[25:52] might be something you need to pray
[25:53] about and look at because you should
[25:54] never be that tied to something for
[25:57] status can you say Amen
[25:59] Supply someone else's needs sometimes so
[26:02] in conclusion in this part god purged
[26:04] the hearts in the book of Acts he purged
[26:07] the hearts of self-focused self-pride
[26:10] true and brought True Fellowship and
[26:13] love that could work amongst the people
[26:15] in relationships why because no one was
[26:19] better than the other they all had been
[26:22] promoted by the Holy Ghost they had all
[26:25] been promoted
[26:27] they had all received a promotion to
[26:30] Sons of Abraham
[26:32] can I get an amen they had all come into
[26:35] sons of Abraham and thus become
[26:37] spiritual millionaires they were all
[26:40] treated as the royalty of Heaven look at
[26:44] that acts 2. look what it says
[26:46] they continued steadfastly in the
[26:49] apostles Doctrine
[26:52] continued still this is this is a
[26:55] relationship with God after Redemption
[26:57] they continued steadfastly
[27:01] consistently staying around it continued
[27:04] step this is the relationship they have
[27:06] with God it wasn't a one-nighter
[27:09] it wasn't every week at church this is a
[27:12] daily continued
[27:15] steadfast in the word in the apostles
[27:19] Doctrine and why were they doing it
[27:21] because they had relations that they
[27:23] were connected with the Lord in their
[27:25] souls can you say amen and when you're
[27:27] connected with the Lord you're hungry I
[27:29] got to hear more of the word I want to
[27:30] know more of the word I want to stay in
[27:32] fellowship with the word and I want to
[27:34] be steadfast I want to be consistent I
[27:37] want to continually be doing it today we
[27:39] have no consistency in things people are
[27:41] in and out they're up and down they're
[27:43] in and out of this and that they can't
[27:45] stay committed to something they can't
[27:47] stay committed to jobs many times they
[27:49] can't be consistent and some people can
[27:51] be ever committed to their jobs to be
[27:53] there every morning on time but you're
[27:56] not consistent with the Lord in your
[27:58] relationship these people were so
[28:01] changed that they loved the Lord so much
[28:03] they continued steadfastly in a
[28:06] relationship with the Lord thank you for
