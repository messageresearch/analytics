========================================

with the love of the Lord and happy to be here with you this weekend let's give God our best this morning happy birthday sister Olivia sister Olivia goes to our assembly and I'm not one to bring everyone's attention upon one person but it's sister Olivia's birthday and I thought it might be good to say happy birthday God bless you Sister everybody love the Lord all right let's turn in our Bibles to First John chapter 1. first John chapter one I'm also happy to have my family with me you don't always get that privilege traveling but I'm just happy to have them all with me today first John chapter one I'm sorry I'm just a bit hoarse I I should be able to pull through here in a few minutes first John chapter 1 verse 1. everybody there that which that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon our hands have handled which means felt after the word of life for the life was manifested that we have seen it and bear Witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye Also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ I would like to preach this morning on the heart of God and I would like to subtitle this morning acting upon the commission and if you have a need from the Lord let's just it just want to show the Lord by the raising of the hand as we just pray together Heavenly Father we certainly appreciate your spirit Lord that has been in these meetings we appreciate your word Lord and the strong confidence that you have placed I pray Lord God that you'll move amongst us one again once again and Lord as we are so needy and Lord I know father the meetings have been a real blessing for us all but we're asking Lord for those that need a breakthrough this morning Lord God that you would grant that I pray that you'll Lift Every discouraged heart I pray Lord God that you'll heal every broken spirit I pray Lord God you'll make yourself real to those that have never met you in the power of your Resurrection I pray Lord that you'll take over this service and Lord you will make yourself known Lord by your power stretch forth your hand to heal and to manifest your word father we welcome you we open our hearts we welcome you here Lord speak to us father we ask that you answer from heaven in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you thank you so much you can have your seeds and brother Branham said that the Cry of the human heart in all ages have been to see God how many can say Amen when Moses met God in the burning bush he said what is your name that I might go back and tell Israel who you are you know what would you name yourself how would you identify yourself and that's when the Lord had spoken I am that I am and and brother Branham said that it pleases God to reveal himself it pleases God to show himself so when you're hungry for God that's the kind of condition you need to be in in a church meeting like this and God reveals himself in many ways in many forms he revealed himself in a pillar of fire he revealed himself in a cloud he revealed himself in a whirlwind he reveals himself in many ways but it is the same God every time when no matter what form he is in he never changes his character and when God revealed himself in a pillar of fire or a pill or a cloud God was not trying to reveal physical attributes but rather manifest his characteristics no man that say what I'm trying to express is it wasn't the fire that he wanted the people to focus on it was what was in the fire it wasn't the Whirlwind that God wanted us to look at it was what was in the Whirlwind and God has sent us a message in this hour and it wasn't a five-foot Kentuckian that God wanted us to look at it was God that was being revealed to the people because God is a spirit and no man has seen God at any time and so God is revealing his characteristics his attributes and so Moses cried Lord Show Me Your Glory how many hearts cry Lord Show Me Your Glory and the Lord said that you can't see me and live he said but he put Moses in the cleft of The Rock and he said when he passed by he saw at the offering he saw the back parts of a man and when he passed by God descended in a cloud and he stood there and proclaimed the name of the Lord and the Lord passed by him and proclaimed the Lord God merciful and gracious and long-suffering Hallelujah an abundant in Mercy and Grace and goodness and Truth keeping Mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin Hallelujah but by no means clearing the guilty see God was revealing what was in him God's morphe he changes his mask from one form to another but yet his character is the same and the Bible said that Spirit became flesh and that's what John said that which was from the beginning our eyes have seen it we have looked upon and our hands have handled him we have felt him the word of life see God had to become flesh in order to pay our penalty the spirit God the Eternal one who never had a beginning or an end had to change his form to pay our penalty for sin now our minds are finite meaning they're limited and God can only reveal so much to us because there's only so much we can comprehend like I've I'm sure that every one of you have tried to think of living forever your mind can't even do it eventually you come to an end you can't imagine what it would be to live forever and ever see so God reveals himself in little pieces to us so our peanut brains don't pop see so God revealed himself in the pillar of fire and then the Whirlwind and theophories and in the prophets in Abraham and in Joshua and David God is revealed in those characters but then God revealed his fullness in Jesus Christ which was the expression of God to man can you say Amen the Bible said no man has seen God at any time but the son has declared him the Bible said that Jesus was the express image of God's person he was the expression of the word he was the expression of all that God is Hallelujah and we can understand him when he became one of us I want you to think of that now brother Branham you know we know that he revealed the mind of God in this age but today I don't want to talk about the back parts of God's mind I want to talk about God's heart because God brother Branham said I used to think God was angry with me and that his son loved me and then I learned that Jesus was the very heart of God he was manifesting God's nature and his love that's why I said when you see me you see the father Hallelujah and now a man's Works declare his character no matter what you say your Works tell you who you are right isn't that right and so Christ declared God's character by his Works he said if you don't believe me believe the works for they testify now Jesus was the expression of God's heart to man and he expressed it in so many ways because human beings you know he we have certain ways so contrary to God and they found a little Harlot woman caught in the very Act of adultery and you would look at her and you'd criticize her and say you know how many families have you busted up what a vile woman you are they pulled up stones and they were going to Stone her according to the law of Moses and Jesus was in the right place at the right time I believe God's timing is perfect and I believe everyone in this building is not here by chance but it is the right place and the right time and everyone's attention like wolves was going to destroy this woman and Jesus caught their attention and he was a he was a high profile figure and they said now what do you say we do with this woman you're unorthodox in all your ways and he said what does your law say they said stoner and Jesus says something amazing he said those without sin cast the first stone see sin is not drinking and smoking pot and and crousing and committing adultery that's the fruits of sin sin is unbelief and the Pharisees were not guilty of carousing and drinking but they were unbelievers and that's what condemned them and one by one the spirit began to convict them and they dropped their stones I wonder what God made them remember he knelt down and began to ride in the sand we have no idea what he wrote but I wonder what happened to make them so condemned that they dropped their rocks and walked away and he looked at the woman he said woman where are your accusers she said I have none he said neither do I accuse thee go sin no more he gave he's a god of Second Chances you don't have to be defeated all your life because you made mistakes he is the god of Second Chances but you're gonna have to reach out and take a hold of the long arm of his grace it was God's heart that done that the woman was guilty and you and I are guilty but it's the heart of God that is reaching for us Hallelujah I think of the the man that was the Bible said that he's he had um he was a leper and back then they were totally outcast totally rejected and from society I mean they thought it was contagious so they were ousted from Israel and they lived his lepers they'd throw to him moldy bread and so they can't be touched they can't be loved and people are repulsed by them it's a type of sin and they had to cry uncleared I cleaned and let everyone know that they were a leper and when nobody would have anything to do with them Jesus passing by a leper looked at him and began to cry said what do you need I want to be clean and there's many a people that can put on a religious show but their heart is leprous and their life cries unclean unclean unclean but if the Lord was manifested in a physical body this morning and he would say what would you have would you be as smart as that leper it says I want to be cleaned I want my heart clean before God's he did not fear him he touched him and I often think what it felt like for a man who have not felt physical touch in years when he touched him when he would take a person that's just totally Outcast and take him in his arms and he speaks the word be clean and he was healed at that moment that was the heart of God it wasn't the doctrine that made him God it wasn't the church that made him God it was the heart the works the expression of God's love he cared for those that could not help themselves I'm talking about God the revelation of God because every one of us are like that leper every one of us is like that woman caught in adultery I believe I'm Sanctified living I believe in a holy life and I believe God gives us the power to do it but every one of us at one time was like that leper and when God speaks me clean he'll take your heart he'll overhaul it he'll cleanse your heart he'll cleanse your mind he'll cleanse your life there is a power in this gospel God didn't come down from heaven and hang on a cross so the church would be reduced to Doctrine he gave his life that you could come out of the pit of despair and your helpless condition and make you alive again he takes the dead and makes them live he takes the Blind and makes them see how many believe in that kind of gospel when Adam had sinned Adam had covered himself with a fig Leaf to hide from God God did not accept it brother Benham said because botany life can't have no feeling but when God sacrificed the lamb it bleeded it bleeded it shook and it died bearing the sins it was something that had feeling in it and I believe our word Our Gospel that we believe in ought to have feeling in it and I believe our meetings ought to have feeling in it then we've got to put something in in order to get something out Heaven Ain't gonna be full of statues Heaven is going to be a living breathing holy Society a civilization of faith [Applause] I don't want fig leaves I want to come Redemption by Blood I want a religion with Felix that's why the Bible said he can be touched stay touched he can be touched by the feeling God knows your sorrows he can be touched by your heart we serve a God that wants to embrace he wants to embrace you take God in his word touch means a place to put oneself in someone else's shoes it means to have compassion and the Bible said God became a man and he suffered he said God could not suffer in the spirit so he become flesh to feel the pain of sickness feel the temptation to feel the temptation of want to feel the temptation of hunger and to feel the power of death that he might take it upon himself and be the right kind of intercessor Hallelujah he bore our infirmities he carried it brother Branham said he said on a rock after a healing campaign and he grown with headache the only way and I'm quoting the prophet the only way God can be expressed it's through love God did not express himself through popular movements he had no place to lay his head no shining movement he did not express himself in Doctrine the only way God can reveal himself it's through love the Bible tells us that he suffered being able to sakower or sympathize with those that are tempted he knows our ups and our Downs our ends and our outs and your Temptation gets so great you can hardly stand it he knows how to sympathize with you he said sir he loves you he'll come after you he'll knock on your heart every backslider in the building he's coming after you he's knocking on your heart he's trying to make himself real to you his love to every Mortal on the face of the Earth it could not be expressed God became flesh that he may feel compassion is feeling for others it is of the Lord's mercies that we're not consumed and that his compassions faileth not how many knows that God reveals himself in compassion and when he when he loosed Israel from their bondage it was an expression of the attribute of God of compassion when he hung on the cross to loose the human race it was an expression of God's compassion I'm talking about who God is today the Bible said Jesus went forth and saw the multitude and he was moved with compassion and healed their sick so this is the ministry of Jesus Christ but when Jesus died and raised again he had Sanctified a church that he may continue his work so the love that flowed from God came down on the day of Pentecost and it was the love of God that flowed from Pentecost and it started right away at the gator beautiful when Peter who at one time wanted to call fire down on a city that would not accept them he was walking by the gate of beautiful and he sees a man who was born from his mother's womb a crippled and the Bible said they made eye contact alums for the poor arms for the poor and Peter looked and when he made eye contact you you've seen that they're like oh goody goody I got a soft heart and Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None no not one of you guys again but such as I have give I Thee he grabbed a hold of him he was a copper wire of the love of God he was a conductor of the compassion of God and the power of God fell through Peter and lifted that man who never walked on his legs and he went leaping and praising God give God a chance let the electric power of God fall in your heart and see if I don't send you rejoicing from your sins Peter not so much as even prayed over him because Peter had a commission and brother Brenham said the compassion that was in Christ is now in the heart of Peter and he didn't have to pray he was commissioned this was the commission of the church is to bring my love into the world foreign Jesus looked over at the people they were like sheep not having a shepherd and the Bible said he had compassion upon them and he said you pray that God will send laborers into the Harvest and you know that that very next chapter the Bible said was the first commission he called his twelve and he gave them power over unclean spirits and to heal the sick and to cast out devils see the compassion of God was raising up a church that would carry on his heart the very last words that came off our Lord's lips because you shall lay your hands upon the sick and they shall recover that was the last Commission I Marvel at the heart of God when you really know you can never know God till you know his character because you can interpret the Bible a million ways but you must know his character brother random said it direct quote that God opened the seals to reveal his character and nature that's why his meetings was Deliverance and healing is because it was the heart of God the gospel many people use the Bible to wage war against others and to cut others down that's not God's business it's the devil's business [Music] Jesus did not waste his time in the synagogues he was out bringing salvation to a people that wanted it it was for the Pharisees if they wanted it for the hungry Jesus said I did not they said why you eat with Sinners he said I I have not come to heal those that are well see they did not know their own need see but it was the harlots and the tax collectors they knew their need they knew they were unworthy they knew they wanted something real and something that the Pharisees could not give them so they were swarming around him the sick were coming to him he was like like bugs on a light but everyone that touched that light was changed and rivers of virtue was flowing from him they didn't need a long a council meeting all they had to do was touch and they were changed we don't need a long service just let God pass through this building and all you got to do is touch it just say Lord come thy my way come by my way and just touch him as he passes by change your thinking it'll change your attitude it'll change your perspective it'll change your heart brother Branham said rivers of virtue flowed from him but then he poured his Spirit back into the church and brother Branham said rivers of virtue ought to flow from the body of Christ you can over emphasize and under emphasize anything but we're talking about the true Revelation the word was made manifest and we felt we touched him I touched him I knew him as a man knows his friend this is the purpose of the great spirit becoming flesh God has commissioned this church to open the prison doors he commanded he said he said the works that I do you shall do also and these signs shall follow them that believe now brother Branham said we have not done what he commanded us to do he said we have done everything but what he told us he never told us to build hospitals he never said build schools he said we have taken another road he said he never said build seminaries he said preach the gospel heal the sick cast out Devils freely you have received freely give he said we have adopted schools and education and emotions and denominations has brought barriers and Jesus gave the church power he said but we're afraid to act opponent back around 1958 brother Branham he had got a phone call from a Mexican man from California and his baby was it was just an infant he was dying of cancer and he asked if brother Brandon would come and brother Branham said that he he was just Divine Providence he picked up the phone and the spirit of the Lord said go and he said my baby's not yet four months and it's dying with cancer something told him to go and he he went there he said the man had little finished wife very sweet woman and he said he went to the hospital he said nurses were there the child was four months old malignant tumors over the Jaws he said it swole way out and he said the doctors tried to operate and they cut deep scars all over the child and he said it it run up its into its tongue the cancer and he said the tongue was you know sticking out of its mouth swollen he said it had turned black and he said it shut off its breathing from its nostrils and the swelling and he said so they had to cut a hole in its throat and he said it was a little whistle he called it him he said it was in little splints and he said he was sitting there they were draining the cancer out of it and he said we went to the bed and his daddy said Ricky your daddy's little boy and he said the little baby hurt his daddy's voice and he he got excited even in that condition by knowing his daddy's voice he got excited and brother Branham looked at it and said God how could you stand it he said I can't believe that you could sit and enjoy something like this and he goes Lord what would you do the Fountain of all Mercy what would you do if you were here he said they had a wrap around its head because they didn't want his head to split open he said Lord what would you do everybody listening amen he said something spoke to me and said but I'm waiting to see what you will do for I have given Authority to my church he said what will you do with my word brother Branham said yes Lord you have commissioned your church he said I he said I prayed over the baby and said I place the blood of Jesus Christ between Satan and this child and he said I pray over it in the name of Jesus Christ and within a few minutes the swelling started going down and God delivered that baby completely he didn't need a vision he didn't need a lightning Flash he needed to act upon the commission that God had given him the word commission means the act of committing or entrusting a sacred charge or Duty that God has given us a duty and he is looking for us to fulfill what he told us to do God sent the church to bring Deliverance to the captives and brother Branham said you've got to act you've got to do something he said now when you will take God in his promise and know that it's God's promise and act upon it you will see the mighty miracles of god return back to the Church of the Living God go ye into all the world and preach the gospel and act upon your commission these signs shall follow them that believe God is waiting for us to take the gospel into the world he said in Matthew 24 I think verse 14 he said my gospel shall go all around the world and then the end shall come brother Branham said the end cannot come until we do what God commanded us to do go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature we are waiting on God and God is waiting on us to do what he told us to he's longing to return he said but he's depending upon his church brother Brenham said it's actually God's heart that is pulsating in his church this church ought to feel the heartthrob of God for a world that's dying a world that's collapsing a world that's blind and naked and don't know it and God's heart is still beating while there's blood on The Mercy Seat this church ought to be the very heartbeat of God for the lost and the sick and the dog The Works that I do ye shall do also he said now that's Healing The Sick raising the dead opening the eyes of the blind he said you'll do these things if you believe me he said but not only heal the Sick by prayer and cast out Devils but impart eternal life the Holy Ghost is coming and given into the hands of the church to impart that's what Calvary meant took and stooped to men and women and lifted them the Sons and Daughters of God and imparted Life to them wow wow Hallelujah Luke chapter 10 you'll see Jesus commanded the seventy to go out and he was teaching them how to go out and preach the gospel and it was in that chapter that a religious man come and said Master how can I have eternal life he said what does he said love thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul and all thy might and you live he said and love your neighbors yourself and he said on this you'll live he said and you know to justify himself in a religious manner but who is my neighbor and Jesus went right into a parable he said there was a man that was traveling from Jerusalem to to Jericho now Jerusalem was on a mountain and Jericho was in the valley and you know if you know your Bible said Jericho was a cursed City so this man was on a road from top to bottom from glory to a curse he was backsliding and brother Branham said the road between Jerusalem and Jericho represents the road to hell and this man was backsliding from Jerusalem and in his journey he got robbed and beaten by thieves and he said that the man was laying there and he said rest ashore if you go on that road from Jerusalem to Jericho you will meet them the man sitting there were just twitters and jitters and here comes a priest and the priest is whistling having a good day on his breakfast with the Brit bishop and he sees him and he goes he tiptoed across the other side and he went around him then come a levite he was on his way to choir practice and he's seen him and he he moved over to the other side of the street then come a Samaritan now this Samaritan is not a part of our church no they they'd act like they have the same God we do but you know this Samaritan is really not you don't waste your time with Samaritans but this man he didn't cross the street the Bible said he looked upon him and had compassion and the man run to his Aid even in a backslidden state even on his wrong his Road the wrong way he went there and he had compassion for that man now the man is laying there beaten by thieves the Bible said he was half dead that means that you are dead spiritually but you're still alive there are many people in the church that are that conditioned they're half dead and the Bible said he went to him and he began to pour oil and wine into his wounds he started a healing campaign he begins to minister to that man he began to to pour in help with that man the Bible said that he laid him upon his own Beast and he brought him down to the end and it was there The Innkeeper was to watch over him and brother Branham said he gave two pence which represented salvation and healing and said if there's anything else that he needs the Holy Ghost is going to supply it he said the end was the church that we catch the people out on the streets and in backslidden conditions and along the highways and God has a church somewhere that he has predestinated to be a hospital to be a place where God can bring healing to the body and the soul and the spirit a place of man can revive a place a man can come back from the dead and get a new start in life a place that a young person can meet God and change them in the power of his resurrection I believe that's what our church ought to be I believe they're not to to be anything else but houses of the Great Commission that sends lied out into a dark world and that even in the presence of God people will be changed since that I have never seen anything like that years ago I was preaching at a church and somehow it happened a lot back in those days I had I had a man in my car I didn't know him I don't even know how he ended up with me and I was going to preach a meeting and uh his brother brother Ray's I was a young evangelist then and uh I brought him to the meeting I don't know him from Adam and it was just a special meeting the Lord just poured himself the man hopped in my car we're driving an hour and a half back to Defiance he said I have done everything there is to do but I have never felt what I felt in that building I said that was the Holy Spirit I never seen him again I dropped him off and I never seen him again but the spirit of God Is A Healer the spirit of God is our living reality and I believe that we should not just push the back slit away but try to bring him to the hospital and I I believe that it more than words I believe those are the kind that God is seeking to men he he a physician don't look for someone healthy a physician needs a job and we give God a good employment by all the headaches and Sorrows we bring but he is a good physician and there is nothing too hard for God there's no addiction there's no devil that is too big God can heal it God can heal drug addicts heroin addicts people that have given up God Is Bigger yeah God Is Bigger Than every devil that holds people bound God Saves hippies people that are hopeless you know there's worse Devils than that brother Branham said the worst devil there is is a religious one and God cares for them too God would love to heal that man that is self-righteous and right in his own eyes and and criticize it sometimes the people that claim to be the most spiritual are the most shallow human beings on the face of the Earth but God wants to heal us a lot of times that's just a lie to make yourself feel that you're Justified just like that man but who is my neighbor and when it came down to expressing The Compassion of Christ they're dodging the issue God has raised up the church to be a Powerhouse that will heal the sick that will heal the spirit that will heal the broken heart that amend the confusion of mind that'll take the people that have lost their confidence in the church and restore it to a true faith in God I realize I'm the righteous or as bold as a lion I know that I'm anointed by the tribe of Judah right now but may it find its place in your heart brother Branham said we ought to live in a consoling atmosphere that people love to be around love is a powerful thing we got this little puppy named Curly bear I mean it literally thrives on love it's like can't you get enough well can you can you get enough the Lord wants us to be that way I can't wait to get to church streaming don't do it for me I've got to get into the presence of God I want in the presence of my people I want to be in presence of the king the Healer Hallelujah and you that have children you know that you keep Band-Aids in stock because at any time they're going to skin knees they're going to skin elbows so it's not I was healed when I was saved every day we need a physician we need Neosporin because we get in bumps and bruises and we get in Things We Don't Belong you just come to Daddy's house he'll put neurosporin on it and he'll cover it up he'll slap you on the bottom and say get back out and play amen how many appreciate our Lord the Bible said he makes Angel spirits and flames of fire ministering Spirits or Angels they're angels for guidance and protection and brother Branham said when you receive the Holy Spirit God places you in a body as a ministering spirit all right come on Hallelujah we all have a Ministry the Great Commission is not on brother Paul alone the Great Commission was given to Believers not pastors these signs follow the Believers and this burden is packed upon the shoulders we need more than just preachers we need workers we need prayer warriors we need people with passion to bring them in we need recruits we need an army ministering spirits to minister to those that are dying and lost God brings you from a life of sin to a life of service how many believe that brother Branham said we are angels angel means messenger we are angels of the Covenant we are angels of good news that there is hope for you brother There's Hope for you sister he said we are angels of the Resurrection amen how many want to be a ministering Spirit sent from the presence of God to minister hope to those that feel like they can't make it another hour brother Branham said just show somebody you care he said a healing goes a long way he said God heals by understanding God heals by love he said just someone that's upset show them you love him and he said God will heal them by that he said just a little love just a little care just a smile to go out of your way a little kind word goes a long way I appreciate you brother I appreciate you keep on sister I saw how hard you worked in the kitchen this weekend God bless you and reward you and fill you appreciate your sacrifice brother we are the body of Christ we are the hands the ministering part of the body the head ain't the ministering part the hands are right God working through you to bring Salvation to a Dying World isn't that wonderful and brother Branham said now God wants to anoint us with sympathy he said an expression of his sympathy will pour over our hearts that's been born of a spirit to reflect in the church the love of God oh sure but you've got a feel for the person you remember the story of Paul Rader he was a Christian he loved the Lord and one morning he got up and he said his wife went Crossways then I know everyone hears beyond that but just so you get the idea so Paul Rader struggling in this area this morning and he said they they she wanted to go somewhere he didn't want to go and she she got her feelings hurt and he said so he grabbed this briefcase and he said they had just a tradition she would walk him to the door she would open the door and he would kiss her and say goodbye she'd say goodbye and he would walk out to the end of the pathway and he would wave by and just he would wave by and he would go on to work he said well this day even though he hurt her feelings he said they went through the same routine and many a times people's heart is so far from what God is doing but they're going through the routine and coming to church even for years it can happen May God heal you today so she went right through the routine and she opened the door he kissed her she kissed him he walked out to the street he's bye bye he starts down and the Lord spoke to him and said what if something was going to happen today and she would never see her again and it really got to him and he turned and he went quickly back to the door and he opened the door and when he did he said he heard some snubbing and she's down there on the floor crying he said I picked her up he said I kissed her he said I walked out the door said bye she said bye and he said I walked away he said brother Branham you know what the difference was he said what was it he said this time it had feeling in it when God sent this message to restore us back he is restoring us to a heartfelt religion not just another church but a living organism this is something different than anything on the face of the Earth it is to be a power that has struck the Earth Jesus had no place to lay his head he had no church but the whole Heavens was his Parish and God's church is to fulfill his work and destroy the works of the devil how many say Lord I want feeling in what I believe I think it'd be good just to really give God a great Embrace this morning God wants action More Than Words the Bible says let love be without hypocrisy let love be indeed and Truth the only way you can ever express God is through love brother Branham said My Success in praying for the sick is that I enter into the fellowship of their sufferings so he's not casual he actually takes time to enter into it brother Branham said that when cross-eyed children would come into the prayer lines God never refused him and the reason was because when Sharon Rose his own daughter was dying her eyes severely crossed she suffered so bad her eyes was totally crossed and he said her little leg was jerking and she died in that condition since that time when he would see a cross-eyed child he would go back to that experience which would touch his heart and he said sometimes God has to squeeze and crush the flower to get the perfume out of it sometimes our trials we think are so bad is actually God trying to bring an attribute our sufferings everything will work for the good to them that love the Lord how many believe that like the little boy when the storm came he was upstairs and the Thunder bang bang Mama come up here and she rushed up there Mama come sleep with me she said honey honey we believe in God God protects us from Storm he said but sleep with me she said honey I don't we're going to rebuke this fear we're not going to accept this fear God is protecting us but come sleep with me she said honey God protects us she he said I believe in God but sometimes I want a god with skin on it we could not know God in spirit form so God loved us and came down and became flesh so he could be felt and when he went off the Earth he did not leave but he poured his Spirit into his charge that this world would experience god with skin on it Hallelujah Hallelujah God always worked through his body everybody loved the Lord preach the gospel to all the world and then the end shall come how many say Lord Make Me A ministering spirit Lord Make Me an Angel of Mercy make me an angel of Light brother Graham said now go in the name of the Lord every one of you into the highways and the hedges and the byways and claim the gospel and go out you women into the neighborhood go to the hospitals and pray for the sick believe it and exercise your faith wow wow he is challenging us to believe his word and step out on the Great Commission exercise your faith in God our job is to believe how easy is that God's job is to do the healing and healing passes through his body and God imparts life through his body he uses by the preaching of the word how shall they hear without a preacher God needs hands he needs willing hearts he's looking for a people that'll sell out Lock Stock and Barrel and give back to God what he gave because love is an exchange you can't love a statue you marry a wife you give and you take you give and you take God has a bride and he's given but he wants love back he wants obedience back God wants a relationship you can have relationship with a Doctrine he's got to be a person a person that you could talk to a person you can walk with I'll be with you always even to the end of the world Hallelujah when the preacher preaches the word of God the Holy Spirit begins to move over the congregation and anoint the people with faith you feel your heart raising up to take God at his word now these are not brother Craig's words these are Christ's words I give you power To Tread upon the head of scorpions and nothing by any means shall harm you is that the word of Our Lord the commission of God was you drive out the enemy we have a commission to cast out evil to cast out Devils to drive out cancer we are not the Healer we only point to the Healer and we are the representation of God's heart on Earth I've seen him save so many beyond what I can count I've seen him heal the sick we all have but we need him today we need him to manifest like never before as the world grows darker the church ought to grow brighter and God is calling us to rise to our feet in a world of perversion in a world that tries to confuse genders and bring confusion on the minds of the people we ought to stand up and say we are Sons and Daughters of God and there's a hope for this Dying World don't you Hunker back God will defend his own word we are not going to bow to your Idols we're not going to bow to your your liberal devils God made man God made woman he has the last word Hallelujah and we believe his word the gospel brings freedom it sets the captive free it breaks cigarette addiction it breaks pornography addiction you don't have to lay your hands on the preacher the preacher lays hands on you you need God to lay his hands on you and he can do that right now [Applause] but you've got to make a choice God is active now he's waiting for you to act Hallelujah just believe him Hallelujah gospel opens the prison doors I'm just curious the Lord brought me out of the world and something got a hold of me beyond me I've not gotten over it and that was when I was 23 years old how many here did God open the prison doors and you how many come out of a prison cell show me raise your hands how many know it was the hand of almighty God that did it a man a leopard cannot change its spots neither Ethiopian their skin and neither can a man that's born in sin become righteous it takes God to make a man righteous and if God can open prison doors for all these people God will open the prison door for anyone that asks he did not die in vain and I'm challenging the young people you may have been raised sheltered but knowing god is another story and God loves you like he loves The Sinner come out of that prison cell for that bondage and be free in Christ [Applause] I always tell my wife we're the Christians we can't expect other people to live we we got to live it and if there's only one in the world God let it be me I know young people have seen disappointments and church splits and all kinds of fanaticism that's only what surrounds the gospel but Christ there's no fault in him and we have something real it is the word of almighty God I believe with all my heart that God who looked upon the people with compassion I believe he looks upon this meeting and that's my prayer Lord look upon us with compassion look upon our needs there are complexes we can't get Beyond there are hurts that we cannot rise above but just ask God to help you you got to be willing to lay it down in order to be healed you say I just can't break through maybe there's sin in your life God will not hear sin separates you from God you say but if I confess it I it will be bad for me it'll be hell for you but the bible promises if you confess your sins God is faithful to forgive and cleanse of all unrighteousness I don't care what you have done give God a chance about in faith and give God a chance and see if he don't change your heart though your sins be a Scarlet it'll be as white as wool come on young people get right with God Lord manifest Your Love move Among Us Lord move in US with a compassion from a man that came from Jerusalem to Jericho and there may be tons that just don't have time because life is busy but God let me be a good samaritan let me be the man that comes and begin to pour oil and wine and bring healing to a broken person who deserved it and we did too but God's compassion he comes into a meeting and he begins to heal old burdens old grudges things that just stay there for years I think we need to push the walls down I really do I think if we want a Revival I think we need to start by taking a step we've never taken before I've been to the altar that ain't what I'm talking about I'm talking about taking a step from your stronghold many times we're in prison not because it is because of our own self we put ourselves there we actually put ourselves in bondage that's why Jesus said go sin no more we put ourselves there by believing our own life we create a world around us and we we believe that life that's what the world is doing but Christ wants to break that and give you his mind which is his word I want to thank God's thoughts my thoughts wrecked my life your thoughts are wreck your life God's thoughts only put you on a path and it gets gooder and gooder hallelujah how many like to start a new year and a new just a new breath of fresh air and say God breathing me Lord touch me like you did the leper I haven't had a Revival in my heart for a long time lord would you come by and touch me let Rivers a virtue Flow by the power of the Holy Spirit and Lord let me let touch my heart touch my mind touch my spirit bring back a love for the word of God again bring back a Revival Lord let my songs come from my soul I'm going to say Lord I want to touch let us raise to our feet let's stand to our feet Lord I want to touch Lord pass by me I want to feel you I need a god with skin on it I need something more than religion more than Doctrine more than church I appreciate it but I need more than church I need a god with skin on it [Applause] Hallelujah not an emotion but from the depths of our hearts I'm hungry for you Lord more of the forget your mistakes Lord I need more of you forget the past I need more of you I'm going to take a step I'm going to confess something I'm gonna go where I've not gone before it'll break the addiction it'll break the power over your life only unbelief can hold you but you got to take a step let's bow our heads in a word of prayer Heavenly Father dear God I know that you are here and Lord I hear your voice calling [Music] and Lord I pray Lord start here at the pulpit start with me Lord come by and touch my heart [Music] go buy brother Paul and cross the platform of the musicians Lord pass by that front row that second row Lord go down Lord start working your way back start moving upon the hearts and I pray Lord God one by one drive away the Accuser drive away those who that were wanting to Stone and condemn but Lord May hope flood the people's hearts drive away our enemy Lord open the prison doors set the captive free Lord touch their hearts and bring change forever Lord

help us to be ministering Angels ministering Spirits from the presence of God Lord Empower us use our hands use our feet use our voices use our life not to express Doctrine but to express your love to

[Music] that's our desire this morning praise the Lord the word of God is Rich to us I can only think of the parable of Jesus who gave the invitation he said in the parable there was an invitation for the wedding supper to go out they sent out the invitations and the first group the first poll they begin to make excuse I can't come I've married a wife I bought a piece of land and so the the leader of the home he just said we'll just put out another call second poll we'll just call those to come the second ones and he said my my house is still not full and then this last poll the last poll let me just say this for believers that know the message shame of a shame on us if we make the third poll only Doctrine [Music] it's so much more than that so in this Parable the third poll is not go out the third poll is compelling them to come in and you can't compel them unless you're convinced and have the heart of God yourself hearing recognizing and then acting on the word and the third Point says you know what go out into the highways and hedges and the third post compel them to come in compel them to come in you know the Devil Makes Us afraid to say something I might offend that person don't offend them but don't hold back from sharing the compassion and Love Of Christ with them not in this hour judgment is getting ready to strike this Earth can you say Amen this morning when I get up and I look at look at the news on my my little phone there the headline and there's yesterday and today there's all kinds of Lights mysterious lights that's the way mysterious lights all over California okay so listen I'm not interpreting anything but some of us Believers know sightings they can't explain but we're investigating angels for judgment we're very close and here is the true heart and love of God where in The Bride of Jesus Christ compel them to come in say this before I I close we have every strings this weekend but we've received this morning our commit we we've been reminded of our commission and it's not here to make money it's not for a better career it's not for a new business God bless us if we do it but you better do it for the motive how can I reach more for Jesus Christ how can I give the compassion of God [Applause] [Music] it's it's it means nothing it's it's our houses and lands if anybody in this earth it should be Believers saying I'll do my duties and responsibilities I'll plan for the future but I want to live as if the Lord's coming right now and I want to compel them to come in the third poll is to compel them to come in because we have the fountain do you know the last scripture of the Bible just before the last you know what it says the spirit and the bride say come It's the final call [Music] and it's not coming from Jesus Christ of Nazareth 2000 years ago it's covered from the spirit of Christ but where it's coming the bride is saying it thirst come [Music] come to a church not a church but there's a fountain open in the House of David I'm drinking from that Fountain there's a fountain open say I'm not a witness sir I don't know what to say God did God he wants laborers in his kingdom he doesn't he didn't call just preachers he called laborers just that knows where the fountain is I know where the fountain is I can't remember all my scriptures I can't remember all the things that that was said in the meetings this weekend but I know where the fountain is because I'm drinking from it [Music] Steve come I'll show you [Music] come on us if we make it a Doctrine people can't be saved by a Doctrine people can't be impressed by another denominational slant on things it has to be the reality of a living God living in us and reaching out and it's not just to the world I'm praying for some Even in our own assembly that God would just love you and break through your walls and barriers young person you're not alone God is here speaking to you and he's loving wanting to break through in your heart

blessing has been handed back into the hands of every son and daughter of God Lord we thank we're thankful that the love of God produces faith that we could step out claim what is ours in Jesus Christ
