Your Ways Are Higher Than Mine

Verse 1:
It's not what I prayed for
It's not what I wanted
It's not something I understand
My circumstances seem so confusing
I'm placing it all in Your hands

Chorus:
Your ways are higher than mine
I want mountains to move
You want me to climb
So I'm gonna trust Your work, Your will, and Your time
Your ways are higher than mine

Verse 2:
One day I'm sure
I will look back and marvel
At how You knew best all along
You see from Heaven
You know it's the hard times
That make my face steady and strong

Bridge:
When I start to doubt, help me believe
Somewhere, so far above me

Written by Rachel Mccutcheon
