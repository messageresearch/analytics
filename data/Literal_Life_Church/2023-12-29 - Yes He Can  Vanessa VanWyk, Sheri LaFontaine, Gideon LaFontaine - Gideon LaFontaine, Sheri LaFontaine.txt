Yes He Can

Lyrics:
Verse 1
Sometimes I wonder, is He faithful?
Does He see me in my trouble?
Does He understand?
Sometimes I question if He's able
Can He rescue, can He save me
Again and again?
But when I look back

Chorus
Did He move every mountain?
Did He part every sea?
Yes, He did
So yes, He can, oh
Did He defeat the darkness?
Did He deliver me?
Yes, He did
So yes, He can
Whoa, yes, He did
So yes, He can

Verse 2
'Cause sometimes those voices try to tell me
I'm forgotten, and I've fallen
Too far from His hands
But I know what kind of God He is
And I'm trusting in His promises
I'm believing and I'm singing
Yes, He can
Whoa

Bridge
'Cause I've seen too much, now I can't deny
He's come through every single time
From the beginning until the end
He did, He will, He can
Now, ooh

Written by Jeff Pardo,  Logan Cain, Madison Cain Jonson, and Taylor Cain Matz
