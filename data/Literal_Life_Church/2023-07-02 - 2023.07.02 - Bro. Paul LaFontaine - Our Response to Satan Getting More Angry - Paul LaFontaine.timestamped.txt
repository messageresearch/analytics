[0:00] Nehemiah we're going to read from
[0:02] Nehemiah
[0:03] chapter 4 Nehemiah chapter 4. thank you
[0:06] for giving me time to just
[0:09] share those things from my heart
[0:11] Nehemiah chapter 4 and verse 1. we're
[0:14] going to read through verse 17 I'll try
[0:17] to read rapidly but I just want you to
[0:19] catch the theme here in the time when
[0:22] they were rebuilding they'd finished the
[0:24] temple and now they were rebuilding the
[0:26] walls of protection around the temple
[0:28] which ended up being the the finish
[0:30] building the walls was the finishing
[0:32] part and I'm always attracted to these
[0:35] scriptures that they were finishing the
[0:37] work because we live in a day that we're
[0:39] in the finish of the work of God how
[0:42] many know that God's Building a building
[0:43] a spiritual building and you're you're
[0:46] that habitation it's not about this
[0:48] building it's about your building being
[0:49] a temple for the Lord and he's finishing
[0:52] that now we're in the finished work of
[0:54] God building his temples and his Temple
[0:57] and now this final stage was building
[0:59] the wall but we find here that when they
[1:02] were in that final stage they got some
[1:05] opposition from the enemy and that's
[1:07] what I want to read about here this
[1:08] morning Nehemiah chapter 4 but it came
[1:11] to pass
[1:11] that when Samuel had heard that we build
[1:14] the wall he was Wrath he was angry and
[1:17] took great indignation and mocked the
[1:21] Jews and he spake before his brother and
[1:23] in the army of Samaria and said what do
[1:25] these feeble Jews well they fortify
[1:27] themselves will they sacrifice will they
[1:30] make an end in a day will they revive
[1:32] the stones out of the heaps of the
[1:34] rubbish which are burned well
[1:36] spiritually speaking yes they will
[1:38] revive and take all the stones that the
[1:41] temple was destroyed and they will be
[1:43] used to revive and bring a Revival and
[1:46] put all that back together the answer is
[1:48] yes that's what we're doing now tobiah
[1:51] and the the ammonite was by him and he
[1:54] said even that which they build if a fox
[1:58] go up he shall even break down their
[1:59] stone wall hear o Our God this Nehemiah
[2:03] asking God now for we are despised and
[2:06] turned their reproach upon their own
[2:07] head and give them for a prey in the
[2:10] land of captivity and cover not their
[2:13] iniquity and let not their sin be
[2:15] blotted out from before thee for they
[2:16] have provoked thee to anger before the
[2:19] Builder so built we the wall and all the
[2:22] wall was joined together unto the half
[2:24] thereof for the people had a mind to
[2:28] work so now the people would not be and
[2:31] Nehemiah had to encourage them don't be
[2:34] distracted by the anger of the enemy
[2:38] keep your mind on what we're doing
[2:42] we're in a building project and we're
[2:44] finished in this building but Satan
[2:46] would like in his anger to stop that to
[2:49] discourage us and Nehemiah says we're
[2:51] going to pray we're going to continue
[2:53] and we're going to the people were of a
[2:56] mind to get back to the work that we're
[2:58] doing
[2:59] but it came to pass that when Samuel and
[3:02] tobiah and the Arabians and the amorites
[3:04] and the astodites heard that the walls
[3:06] of Jerusalem were made up and that the
[3:08] breaches began to be stopped then they
[3:11] were very raw so before their wrath and
[3:13] now they're very Roth Wednesday night I
[3:15] said why is the devil becoming even more
[3:18] angry
[3:20] now they're very Roth at this this work
[3:22] is continuing they're getting a
[3:25] revelation of what to do and they're
[3:26] doing it can you say amen and conspired
[3:29] all of them together to come to fight
[3:30] against Jerusalem and to hinder it so
[3:33] now they're going to gather and they're
[3:35] going to fight against this here's
[3:37] nehemiah's response nevertheless we made
[3:41] our prayer unto God and set a watch
[3:44] against them day and night because of
[3:46] them listen there are some incidences
[3:48] today that
[3:50] we don't have the answers for many times
[3:53] and so we have to go to prayer
[3:57] fervent prayer
[3:59] his response is that you know what we're
[4:01] going to pray and we're not going to
[4:03] stop praying because the devil would
[4:05] like us to stop praying but we're not
[4:07] going to stop praying and sometimes
[4:09] that's the only thing we have left to do
[4:12] but we're going to bring a fervent
[4:13] prayer in faith for every need
[4:17] and Judah said the strength of the Bears
[4:19] of the burns is decayed and there is
[4:21] much rubbish so that we are not able to
[4:23] build the wall verse 13. therefore said
[4:25] I in the lower places behind the wall
[4:27] and on the higher places I even set the
[4:30] people after their families with their
[4:32] swords their Spears and their bows and I
[4:35] looked and Rose up and said unto the
[4:36] Nobles into the rulers and to the rest
[4:38] of the people be not ye afraid of them
[4:41] remember the Lord which is great and
[4:43] terrible and fight for your brethren
[4:45] your sons your daughters your wives your
[4:49] houses
[4:51] blessed be the name of the Lord don't be
[4:53] intimidated by the anger of the enemy
[4:55] can you say Amen we're going to pray and
[4:58] we're going to continue to fight not
[5:00] just for us but for our sons and
[5:02] daughters as well
[5:04] and it came to pass when our enemies
[5:06] heard that it was known unto us and God
[5:08] had brought their counsel to not God
[5:11] stepped in and brought their counsel to
[5:14] not that they couldn't even fight
[5:17] when that happened then they that we
[5:20] returned all of us to the wall
[5:23] even one unto his work back to the job
[5:27] back to our Focus back to God's
[5:30] achievement can you say Amen
[5:32] because why vengeance is mine saith the
[5:35] Lord let God take care of your problems
[5:39] we pray and we get back to the work of
[5:41] the Lord and it came to pass from that
[5:43] time forth that half of my servants
[5:46] wrought in the work and the other half
[5:47] of them held both their Spears the
[5:49] Shields and the bows and uh
[5:52] habardians and the rulers behind all the
[5:54] house of Judah they which build it on
[5:56] the wall and they that bear burdens with
[5:58] those that laided everyone with one of
[6:01] his hands everyone with one of his hands
[6:03] wrought in the work and with the other
[6:05] hand held a weapon every Everybody
[6:07] anybody ever see a picture like that
[6:09] with one hand they're building the wall
[6:11] the other hand they got a weapon for
[6:13] protection
[6:15] for the builders everyone had a sword
[6:17] girded by his side and so build it and
[6:19] he that sounded the trumpet was by me
[6:21] praise the Lord we'll just stop right
[6:23] there there's so much here in fact I
[6:25] already preached my sermon so we could
[6:26] close now
[6:28] we could shout for an hour
[6:31] praise the Lord
[6:32] we don't have to be afraid can you say
[6:34] Amen let's pray I want to speak on our
[6:37] response to Satan getting more angry
[6:42] father we pray you'll bless your word
[6:44] this morning we pray that the anointing
[6:46] of God would fall on me and upon my lips
[6:48] Lord and I am feeble Within Myself I
[6:51] tell you that all the time I I don't
[6:54] know why you chose me for this work to
[6:56] Shepherd your people but lord I can't
[6:58] get away from the calling and so I offer
[7:00] up not myself but I offer the word
[7:02] before the people I offer your promise
[7:04] to anoint their faith this morning I
[7:07] pray to reach out and stand and I pray
[7:09] that you'll bless every need that's
[7:11] under the sound of our voice wherever it
[7:13] may be I pray that you'll bless each one
[7:15] with the word today as we commit the
[7:17] service to you in the name of the Lord
[7:19] Jesus Christ we ask it amen God bless
[7:22] you may be seated
[7:25] how many know that Satan is getting
[7:27] angry and getting even more Angry all
[7:29] the time
[7:30] we are seeing Satan's Fury
[7:33] Unleashed like never before we've been
[7:36] in conversations with Believers saying
[7:38] it just seems like there's an increase
[7:40] of the devil doing his work and he's
[7:42] very angry and his anger is increasing
[7:45] towards Believers and as we spoke
[7:48] Wednesday night the main reason is that
[7:51] there is a people in the last days
[7:52] that's becoming one with the head Jesus
[7:55] Christ because the head Christ has
[7:58] returned to us his full headship has
[8:00] returned to us we can't become one with
[8:02] our husband until he is present here and
[8:06] then we can become one with him he the
[8:08] word Christ has returned to us in the
[8:11] last days the full word Christ has
[8:13] returned to us and it's not just your
[8:15] Bibles it's the person of Christ and
[8:18] when the bride gets a revelation that
[8:19] his headship is here then they know
[8:21] they're the only ones on Earth that it's
[8:23] time for me to submit to it it's time
[8:25] for me to come under that headship and
[8:27] become one with that head I mentioned
[8:29] Wednesday night about a wedding if a
[8:31] bride was there and all the wedding
[8:33] party everybody showed up but the
[8:34] husband didn't show it up you couldn't
[8:36] have a wedding and so everybody's
[8:37] waiting you know and then maybe uh he
[8:40] maybe he's a bit late and so then he
[8:42] shows up he comes back to the back of
[8:43] the building somebody sends a notice to
[8:45] the front and tells the bride he's in
[8:47] the house he's in the building he's here
[8:50] and great joy settles on her because
[8:52] he's the husband's an out you can't
[8:54] proceed with the wedding without the
[8:55] husband
[8:57] and so when she gets the word he's in
[9:00] the house great joy comes because the
[9:02] wedding can continue there can be a
[9:04] wedding I want to tell you in the last
[9:05] days ahead Christ has returned to us in
[9:08] the form of the word can you say amen
[9:10] and when he's here the body can become
[9:13] one with the head she can become one in
[9:15] a marriage and then we go to a marriage
[9:17] supper of the Lamb
[9:19] so now the head Christ is here we have
[9:22] the mind of Christ but even greater than
[9:24] that there's a body coming one with it
[9:26] and they're manifesting Christ through
[9:29] her Christ is manifesting that he's here
[9:32] through the body in the last days and
[9:35] this is what Satan is howling about I'll
[9:37] read some quotes in a few minutes or
[9:39] minutes where he says in Christ the
[9:41] mystery the prophet says he says that
[9:43] that this is what Satan is howling about
[9:45] this is what Satan is so angry about
[9:48] Christ is here the headgem is here the
[9:51] bodies become Wing one with it there's a
[9:53] Vindication he is here and so he keeps
[9:55] saying this is what Satan is angry about
[9:58] as I said Wednesday night it's not your
[10:00] personality that Satan doesn't like it's
[10:03] not that you God would bless you or you
[10:05] don't have a lot of things that has
[10:06] nothing to do with Satan's anger it's
[10:08] when a Believer is becoming one in a
[10:11] marriage with Christ the word that's
[10:13] what he how's about that's what he gets
[10:16] angry when he begins to see the life
[10:18] flowing through body members and it's
[10:21] manifesting the same way it did two
[10:23] thousand years ago Satan begins to get
[10:25] angry
[10:27] now the climax comes in and gets even
[10:29] more Angry the bride has been laying in
[10:32] the presence of the Sun for many years
[10:35] now and she's maturing into manifested
[10:38] sons of God
[10:39] and you that know your Bible know that
[10:41] this last days is when it says all
[10:44] creation is waiting for the
[10:46] manifestation of the sons of God
[10:49] well we can't manifest anything until
[10:51] he's here
[10:53] I know we meet him in the air there's
[10:54] the physical return of Jesus Christ
[10:56] there's a coming of the Lord that we're
[10:58] still looking forward to but he comes
[11:00] because we have to become one with his
[11:02] headship he has to have the preeminence
[11:04] in the bride's life and there's no other
[11:06] group of people in the face either they
[11:08] accept those elected ones those that are
[11:10] Holy Ghost people that are coming one
[11:13] with this word and she's doing it and
[11:16] Satan is howling at it he doesn't like
[11:18] it because they're maturing into these
[11:21] manifested sons of God and that is
[11:23] happening now by the power of God not by
[11:27] intellect not by Mysteries not just
[11:29] knowing the Mysteries not by head
[11:31] knowledge not by understanding it up
[11:33] here but there's a power in it that's
[11:35] manifesting through his people
[11:38] preaching Satan can't stop that
[11:44] no intellectual mind can stop what's
[11:47] already been put in motion
[11:49] in the cycle of the seventh seal which
[11:51] is the coming of the Lord he said we're
[11:53] in the cycle of it already and once
[11:56] that's put into motion Satan can't stop
[11:58] it no matter no matter what he does he
[12:00] can't stop it no matter what what
[12:02] fighting he does there's no demon in
[12:05] hell can stop what God has put into
[12:07] motion
[12:08] he couldn't stop at the turn the first
[12:10] time when Christ came the first time
[12:12] when things were set in motion and that
[12:14] that that young 15 year old girl
[12:17] believed the word and something happened
[12:19] inside of her and and a supernatural uh
[12:23] uh seed was planted inside of her which
[12:25] was Christ by her believing there isn't
[12:28] one Herod there isn't one Spirit there
[12:31] isn't one demon there's no political
[12:33] system that could stop that child from
[12:36] being born
[12:38] Paul says I travail until Christ be
[12:41] formed in you and once he's formed
[12:43] inside you it's going to begin
[12:44] manifesting and there's nothing Satan
[12:47] can do to stop it
[12:50] it's good you can't stop it can't stop
[12:54] this power it's always been about
[12:56] getting angry at our Revelation I forgot
[12:59] something Wednesday night and I woke up
[13:01] before in the morning I said you forgot
[13:02] to say this you forgot to complete that
[13:04] point so thankfully I have another
[13:06] another service to complete it
[13:09] I was trying to give the example from
[13:11] the very beginning of the garden Satan's
[13:13] trouble and his anger was rooted in the
[13:15] Revelation that Believers had
[13:18] he became jealous and resentful towards
[13:20] it so I went through this thing and how
[13:22] Cain brought this and said this is what
[13:25] God wants this is where I'm going to
[13:26] worship Abel brought a bloody Sacrifice
[13:29] by Revelation but I forgot to end it
[13:32] that that's where Cain got so angry at
[13:34] Abel that he actually killed him
[13:37] he murdered them
[13:39] that's how angry people be can become
[13:42] under the spirit of Satan at another
[13:45] believer
[13:48] don't take it personal if you've got a
[13:51] revelation from God and you're acting
[13:53] that out by Revelation not into that you
[13:56] should expect that some are going to get
[13:59] upset about it
[14:00] you can expect to be persecuted
[14:03] can you say Amen so here that began in
[14:06] the garden and all the way through there
[14:08] was tension all the way through there
[14:10] was tension and the tension between the
[14:12] cap of Satan and the camp of God was
[14:14] usually this God God's people were
[14:16] living out of Revelation by a mystery
[14:18] they caught by Revelation they're living
[14:20] it out uh there's a comment there in
[14:22] Christ the mystery God revealed the
[14:24] people of the Old Testament he says they
[14:26] were they they didn't know what they
[14:28] were doing they only knew they were LED
[14:30] of God to do something I love that
[14:32] statement they didn't know what they
[14:34] were living out in the Old Testament but
[14:36] they were in the vision of God living
[14:37] out a type and Shadow of Christ they
[14:39] didn't know what they were doing but
[14:41] they only knew they were LED of God to
[14:43] do something
[14:45] that's the way we are today we can't
[14:47] explain everything we're doing when
[14:49] you're doing it by Revelation you can't
[14:50] explain it all up here but you're living
[14:52] it out can you say amen and Satan's
[14:55] going where's this coming from it's
[14:56] coming from a revelation that Satan
[14:58] can't get his grubby mitts on
[15:02] Hallelujah and so now here we come Satan
[15:06] getting angry more angry and uh did you
[15:09] ever have somebody get mad at you and
[15:14] more mad and more ad and just more and
[15:16] more more mad and it just keeps
[15:18] festering against you
[15:21] and you weren't doing anything
[15:22] intentional to make them mad now if
[15:25] you're doing something intentional
[15:28] I'm talking about a person now
[15:30] because the devil
[15:31] I like to make you mad
[15:34] intentionally
[15:36] but not a not a not a motive of Just In
[15:38] My Own Strength but if this word if it
[15:41] bothers him to keep preaching all the
[15:43] message and all the counsel of his word
[15:45] if that bothers Satan then I'm going to
[15:49] keep preaching it
[15:51] amen if that makes him more Angry then
[15:53] I'm going to keep doing it I'm going to
[15:55] keep building this wall I'm going to
[15:56] keep doing I'm going to keep believing
[15:57] it but did you ever anybody ever have
[16:00] somebody just they're just angry with
[16:01] you and getting more and more angry but
[16:03] you didn't do anything intentional to to
[16:05] to receive that type of anger towards
[16:07] yourself and uh this is how it is
[16:10] sometimes is that you're not really
[16:12] doing anything necessarily out of the
[16:15] ordinary but just living the life and
[16:17] believing and uh uh you know when
[16:20] someone is mad at you and becomes more
[16:22] angry at you and you haven't done
[16:24] anything intentionally to bring it then
[16:27] you got to look and say I don't have the
[16:29] problem here
[16:31] that person has a problem
[16:34] they come to you with built up angers I
[16:37] just I can't believe you did this then
[16:39] they go off on you and you're going my
[16:40] goodness chill out a little bit what did
[16:43] I do and if I did something I want to
[16:45] apologize for it a lot of people don't
[16:46] come and tell you what you did wrong I
[16:49] think we should be adults in Christ and
[16:51] brothers and if you got something to get
[16:52] somebody the Bible says to go tell them
[16:56] but the investor in their anger then
[16:58] they're so angry at you they lash out at
[17:00] you and they've never even talk about
[17:01] you don't even know what you've done
[17:03] and so the problem is not with you then
[17:05] you have to release that because they've
[17:08] got the problem
[17:10] they've got the problem with their anger
[17:14] this is the devil is that I can safely
[17:17] say that he's the one with the problem
[17:21] brother Wallace I'm not the one with the
[17:24] problem I have the Lord the devil's the
[17:27] one that's got the problem with the word
[17:28] of God and a problem with my revelation
[17:31] and so I'm not going to live under his
[17:33] guilt I'm not going to live under his
[17:35] threatening can you say Amen I'm not
[17:37] going to live under this devil is
[17:38] becoming more Angry in these last days
[17:40] before this Rapture I'm not going to be
[17:42] affected by that I want to lose sleep
[17:45] over that can you I'm not going to be
[17:46] intimidated by the report of the enemy
[17:49] can you say Amen his anger is not going
[17:51] to bother me
[17:53] because he's the one with the problem
[18:00] I say to all of you and those those are
[18:02] listening in the Toledo area and the
[18:03] broadcast what Toledo needs in all this
[18:06] area in this Michigan area what what
[18:08] this area needs is thousands of lived
[18:10] voices the Thunder of God centering out
[18:13] in sweetness and Holiness and Purity and
[18:16] undefiled lives walking around in the
[18:19] Earth today without a blemish real
[18:21] Christians that's thundering out against
[18:23] the enemy the devil don't care how loud
[18:25] you can holler the devil don't care how
[18:28] you can jump and how much you can do
[18:29] this or shout but What Hurts The Devil
[18:32] is to see that Sanctified holy life
[18:35] consecrate into God if you say anything
[18:38] to them call them anything you want
[18:40] they're just as sweet as they can be and
[18:42] they move right on oh my that throws
[18:45] them away that's the Thunder that shakes
[18:48] the devil
[18:49] Hallelujah that's what the kingdom of
[18:51] God needs that's what this area needs
[18:54] that's what the world needs it's not
[18:56] your personality it's when someone gets
[18:58] a revelation and they're living a
[19:00] Sanctified life with that revelation
[19:02] that's what makes the enemy mad
[19:05] Thunders out against the enemy he hates
[19:08] a confession of faith Satan hates a
[19:10] confession of faith when it's dark and
[19:13] there's no hope he can't stand a
[19:15] confession of faith Satan hates that
[19:18] but the Believers are going to do it
[19:21] Believers are going to say Lord anoint
[19:22] my faith
[19:24] I have faith given to me by God but
[19:26] anointed make it Revelation faith
[19:29] because this is the thunder that comes
[19:31] out against the enemy so now I want to
[19:34] move along and say another reason that
[19:35] Satan is mad and I know this is simple
[19:37] but another reason that Satan is getting
[19:40] more angry now is because I believe his
[19:43] days are numbered
[19:46] I believe his days are numbered
[19:49] and I'm I'm wondering if lately Satan is
[19:52] trying to take his final swing right now
[19:57] the final punch the the final because
[20:00] he's so weak he hardly has anything left
[20:02] after fighting the bride for six
[20:04] thousand years he hardly has anything so
[20:06] he's going to take the final swing that
[20:08] he has the final punch that he has
[20:10] because he has nothing left and he knows
[20:13] that his days are numbered and it's in
[20:15] these final days that he gets angry it's
[20:19] when the time came listen now it's when
[20:22] the time came for the Deliverance that
[20:25] that is when Pharaoh got more angry with
[20:28] God's people when it was time for their
[20:30] Deliverance Pharaoh got more angry
[20:34] shouldn't that say something to us we're
[20:37] close to Deliverance so what's going to
[20:39] happen the devil's going to get more
[20:41] angry at you now you can look at it and
[20:43] say I'm scared of her no don't be scared
[20:44] him just say my my homecoming is very
[20:47] very soon here let them get angry
[20:49] because it's probably all through the
[20:51] scripture every time he got more Angry
[20:53] it was time for the people of God's
[20:55] Deliverance to get out of here
[20:58] Pharaoh increases the pressure Pharaoh
[21:00] increases then when they he said he let
[21:02] him go then he got more mad and he
[21:04] turned on them and he came with an all
[21:06] Pharaoh's Army he kept his anger
[21:08] increase more and more all the time it's
[21:11] because the time of Deliverance was at
[21:13] hand Speed Ahead 2000 years it's when
[21:16] Christ was about to be born that the
[21:19] Bible says that Herod got Roth he began
[21:22] to kill the children he began to take
[21:24] extra measures to kill the children
[21:26] because the Bible says he got more wrath
[21:28] about this thing why the time of Christ
[21:31] being delivered was at hand
[21:36] I look at the lgbtq if I'm saying it
[21:40] right XYZ
[21:43] chanting in their parades were coming
[21:46] for your children
[21:50] Satan has become more Wrath
[21:53] a home that is chosen to apply the token
[21:57] and live a Sanctified life
[21:59] and those children are under that
[22:01] headship and Direction and obedient to
[22:03] it
[22:04] I've been studying that Passover night
[22:07] some stuff Charles Spurgeon said I'll
[22:09] probably read it in a few weeks Charles
[22:11] Spurgeon elaborates on this Passover and
[22:14] says it's it's not just that Christ paid
[22:16] for us but look at them in that evening
[22:18] because the the CR what happened was is
[22:21] the death angel was coming to the home
[22:23] into the firstborn and God gives them a
[22:25] token to apply to the door of the blood
[22:27] to the door on display but then he says
[22:30] be in your home there and they begin to
[22:32] Rejoice because it was a Passover Lamb
[22:35] unleavened bread they ate together was a
[22:37] Passover which means that Death Angel
[22:40] would pass over their house and without
[22:44] the blood without the word which the
[22:46] bleeding word is that benefits of the
[22:48] Lamb without that he won't pass over our
[22:51] house we have no protection against
[22:54] homosexuality for our children we have
[22:56] no protection outside of the token Holy
[22:59] Ghost can you say Amen don't try to do
[23:01] it in your own intellect try to try to
[23:03] hold your kids back pray with them and
[23:05] apply their token to your home
[23:07] can't I don't have enough amens in this
[23:09] this morning you know this is reality
[23:11] he's coming for your children we have
[23:14] nothing but the token of the blood of
[23:16] Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost
[23:19] and they were rejoicing because they
[23:21] heard that Death Angel pass all the
[23:23] houses and go to different ones and the
[23:25] screams and cries as firstborns would
[23:27] die but in their home their firstborn
[23:29] was still that means it passed over and
[23:32] Christ Our Passover land went to Calvary
[23:34] you don't have to go to judgment you
[23:36] don't have to be judged for your sins
[23:38] your mistakes are under the blood of
[23:40] Jesus Christ jobs that's going to pass
[23:42] over your life and you ought to rejoice
[23:44] in that this morning
[23:46] [Applause]
[23:49] Hallelujah
[23:52] it was it was coming the enemy the death
[23:54] angel for the children
[23:56] coming for the children
[23:58] Herod was Roth coming for the children a
[24:00] lot more could be said about that I want
[24:02] to show you his time is short out of
[24:04] Revelations 12 verse 1. notice this this
[24:08] is a little bit lengthy reading as well
[24:09] but look at this I know you've studied
[24:11] this before but look how real it is and
[24:13] there appeared a great Wonder in heaven
[24:15] a woman clothed with the sun and the
[24:16] moon under her feet upon her head a
[24:18] crown 12 stars and she being with child
[24:21] child cried travailing in birth and pain
[24:24] to be delivered so right now we have a
[24:27] vision that John is having of a woman
[24:30] the Jews and they're getting ready to be
[24:33] delivered to that man-child and this
[24:35] happens first of all to Christ coming
[24:37] and then Herod becomes wrath but then
[24:40] second of all is Christ being formed in
[24:42] the bride so it's just spiritual
[24:43] happening and she being with child cried
[24:47] travailing and birth and pain to be
[24:48] delivered and there appeared another
[24:49] Wonder in heaven and behold a great red
[24:52] dragon having seven heads and ten horns
[24:54] and seven crowns upon his head and his
[24:56] tail drew a third part of the stars of
[24:58] Heaven and did cast them into the Earth
[25:00] and the dragon stood before the woman
[25:02] which was ready to be delivered for to
[25:04] devour her child as soon as it was born
[25:07] this is our devil this is his anger this
[25:11] is his agenda when Christ is being
[25:15] formed inside of a people and ready to
[25:18] be delivered that's when he becomes more
[25:20] angry
[25:23] she brought forth a man-child who was to
[25:26] rule all nations with a rod of iron and
[25:28] her child was caught up into God into
[25:30] his throne the devil missed him he
[25:33] couldn't get him and the woman fled Into
[25:34] the Wilderness where she had the place
[25:36] repaired of God that they should feed
[25:37] her there are three thousand two hundred
[25:39] and three score days all that types into
[25:42] eventually the gospel spreading and
[25:45] coming over to America which was a Haven
[25:47] for the church to come to in that time
[25:49] she had no safe place in Europe anymore
[25:52] so she came over here so she could be
[25:54] protected for a Time the United States
[25:56] was that haven for them to come to
[26:00] well she wouldn't be prosecuted by the
[26:02] church of England and also the Catholic
[26:04] church so she come over for a season to
[26:06] be here now Speed Ahead of our country
[26:09] now look where we're at now and
[26:10] everything turns around
[26:12] and now we have the same devil that's
[26:14] going to go after an economical Council
[26:16] go after ones go after that that true
[26:20] faith of Pentecost in the people he's
[26:22] going to go after that in our same
[26:24] country of America
[26:26] because it's the Dragon
[26:28] then then he sees the vision and there
[26:30] was a war in heaven Michael and his
[26:32] angels fought against the dragon and the
[26:34] dragon fought and his angels because
[26:36] there's been a war going on ever since
[26:38] Christ was born actually actually ever
[26:41] since the beginning there's been a war
[26:42] going on but when Christ was born and he
[26:45] didn't grab that man child and stop that
[26:47] because he couldn't stop it now there's
[26:48] been war in heaven for 2000 years and he
[26:51] Satan prevailed not neither was there
[26:53] Place found any more in heaven and that
[26:55] great Dragon was cast out that old
[26:58] serpent called the devil and Satan was
[27:00] deceive of the whole world he was cast
[27:02] out into the Earth and his angels were
[27:04] cast out with him and I Heard a Voice
[27:07] Now notice now he's fighting in the
[27:09] other dimension he's fighting constantly
[27:11] fighting Believers and fighting the
[27:12] faith of the Believers but now notice
[27:15] the change he's cast out of the Heavenly
[27:17] Dimension to Earth and the same things
[27:20] happens the only reason he could be cast
[27:22] out of Heaven to the Earth is because
[27:24] the bride's
[27:26] being delivered
[27:30] and his angels were cast out with him
[27:32] and I heard a loud voice saying now is
[27:35] salvation come salvation and strength in
[27:37] the Kingdom of our God and the power of
[27:39] His Christ for the accuser of our
[27:42] Brethren is cast down which accused them
[27:45] before our God day and night and they
[27:48] overcame him by the blood of the lamb
[27:50] and by the word of their testimony and
[27:52] they love not their lives unto death I
[27:54] say praise the Lord I say we need to
[27:57] hear testimonies more and more and more
[28:01] I say we need to overcome by the blood
[28:03] of the lamb and by our testimony
[28:06] I want to hear the testimonies text them
[28:09] to me send them to me because we're in
[28:11] an hour we need to hear the testimony of
[28:13] what the Lord is doing it'll make the
[28:15] devil angry but we're going to make him
[28:17] angry because what we're not going to
[28:19] stop testifying of what God is doing in
[28:21] this last minute
[28:24] if we don't testify of God's work then
[28:26] we're going to hear all the gossip and
[28:28] the persecution and the negative of the
[28:31] even this church
[28:34] it's good preacher negative travels
[28:37] faster than positive
[28:39] somehow with our cell phones and with
[28:42] our what we tell our children and our
[28:44] families and the gossip and it's mostly
[28:46] all negative and it just passes along
[28:48] passes along that's why sometimes it
[28:50] takes a while when you come together
[28:52] just if you'll yield yourself I didn't
[28:55] intend on saying this but we live in a
[28:57] dark time and then you hear all the
[28:58] stuff this and the messages going on
[29:01] this family and the church don't like me
[29:02] and oh
[29:04] and that's why it's hard for the song
[29:06] leader to just get you in the spirit of
[29:09] God that's his job
[29:11] because you're all down and depressed
[29:13] sometimes when I start preaching it
[29:14] takes a while for you to come on into
[29:16] the Same Spirit I'm in
[29:18] I don't blame you for that but listen
[29:20] try some Services where you come all
[29:22] prayed up ready to go
[29:25] and you you spend Saturday go to bed a
[29:29] little early praying and spend Saturday
[29:30] maybe talking about the testimony and
[29:32] the positive things that are going on
[29:34] the things God is doing the devil
[29:36] doesn't like that and he his gossiping
[29:39] Spirits tend to run away and other
[29:41] people will run away if you start
[29:42] talking like that because that's not
[29:44] their language positive is not their
[29:46] language talking about the kingdom of
[29:48] God and the good things are it's not the
[29:50] devil's language gossip is this language
[29:51] negative is his language persecution
[29:54] accusing Elders is his language
[29:57] you start doing it in Satan flees like
[30:00] my dad in the car one day
[30:02] devil telling them you're you're not
[30:04] even
[30:05] a believer
[30:07] depressing and putting them down and
[30:09] speaking to them my dad got so upset he
[30:11] said I can't believe you come in this
[30:13] car like this and start talking to me
[30:14] like that
[30:16] so well you're not even going to make it
[30:20] and he started responding to that we
[30:22] said if you want to have a conversation
[30:23] I'm going to start talking back to you
[30:25] I am a Son of God I've been washed by
[30:27] the blood of the lamb and he just said
[30:29] lay that laid it all out and he says
[30:31] Satan guess what I am going to make it
[30:32] in a rapture
[30:34] and the whole atmosphere in the car
[30:36] chains and Satan just Scurry It Off
[30:39] don't let him talk to you
[30:41] don't let the gossips
[30:43] [Applause]
[30:46] it's tough and say if that's where
[30:48] you go ahead and do it I've got a work
[30:50] to do in the kingdom of God God is doing
[30:53] great things and I'm going to stick with
[30:54] that word
[30:57] trying to help you out
[30:59] it's the negative that travels faster
[31:01] than the positive but I believe these
[31:03] people are testifying of the glory of
[31:05] God not only overcoming but the
[31:07] testimonies the word of their testimony
[31:09] is the way they overcome and they love
[31:11] not their lives under the desk and death
[31:12] I got to finish this now and therefore
[31:14] Rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell on
[31:16] the earth woe to the inhabitants of the
[31:18] earth of the sea for the Devils come
[31:20] down unto you having great wrath because
[31:23] he knoweth that he hath but a short time
[31:32] ah see
[31:35] so what in in this knowing that is time
[31:38] and short what's the response it says
[31:41] that having great Wrath
[31:44] uh fairy I'm getting mad and why is it
[31:48] he knows that his time is shorts
[31:54] I know when this is this is when the
[31:55] bride goes up in a Rapture and he's cast
[31:57] to earth oh you don't want to be on
[31:59] earth during tribulation because the
[32:02] full theory of judgment and Satan's
[32:04] wrath and you know he wanted to take it
[32:06] out on the bride but God takes the bride
[32:07] in a Rapture he's going to take it out
[32:09] on the foolish virgins he's going to
[32:11] take it out of the Kingdom he's going to
[32:12] take it out because he's just so angry I
[32:16] lost I didn't win and I'm just gonna
[32:18] take it out on everybody
[32:21] but he's feeling that way now because he
[32:23] knows his time is short
[32:26] I'm preaching to you this morning but
[32:28] I'm preaching to the devil too
[32:30] because he's here in the service did you
[32:32] know he goes to church pretty faithful
[32:34] more faithful than some of you
[32:37] he's here every service so if he's here
[32:39] devil I might as well preach to you too
[32:42] your days are numbered get angry all you
[32:45] want to you can't stop Christ being
[32:47] formed in the people
[32:49] there is not a thing that you can do to
[32:52] stop it
[32:53] you can bring sicknesses you can
[32:55] threaten us you can scare us Satan you
[32:58] can do a lot of things to a Believer
[33:00] matter of fact tomorrow we may not know
[33:02] the next thing that you would try to do
[33:04] but Satan we are not afraid we are not
[33:07] afraid of what you would bring us
[33:09] because the Revelation in my heart you
[33:13] can't take that away
[33:16] glory be to God I feel like doing a
[33:19] victory march
[33:21] Hallelujah we haven't had one in a while
[33:23] we may just have one at the end of this
[33:25] service of victory march and that that's
[33:27] things the devil doesn't like as well
[33:30] get back up here and get on your notes
[33:33] brother Paul
[33:35] I'm walking a little slow today because
[33:36] I scraped my toe pretty bad
[33:39] so might as well be honest about it
[33:41] that's why I'm walking a little slow and
[33:43] Catering to that toe
[33:51] so going back to a few quotes here from
[33:53] Wednesday night just not all of them but
[33:55] just a few
[33:56] if you guys want to pull that now
[33:58] say so now just going back to that theme
[34:01] that it's it's what he housed at is the
[34:04] Revelation that the people of God are
[34:06] catching in the end time not saying well
[34:09] glory to God we shout hallelujah we sing
[34:11] that ain't it I'm a missionary what he's
[34:13] saying is that that's not what Satan
[34:15] how's that that's not what Satan get
[34:16] angry gets angry at we believe in that
[34:19] I feel like shouting even right now and
[34:21] I might do some of it but that's not
[34:23] really what Satan gets really angry at
[34:26] he said I'm a missioner I've been seven
[34:28] times practically around the world see
[34:29] I've seen heathens devils and everything
[34:31] else dance and Shout I've seen all kinds
[34:33] of fleshly manifestations that's carnal
[34:35] but I'm talking about the headship of
[34:38] Christ
[34:41] notice being personally identified by
[34:45] the original headship we have the answer
[34:47] to the to the devil's question amen
[34:50] glory we have the answer to the devil's
[34:53] question he Christ is risen and has paid
[34:56] the price and raised up the head or the
[34:58] body the devil can't stand it that's the
[35:00] reason these ecumenical kingdoms are
[35:02] setting up that's the reason they're all
[35:04] coming into what they're doing now the
[35:06] devil that's the reason he's howling the
[35:08] way he is his wickedness his scheme has
[35:11] been uncovered by the Risen resurrected
[35:14] Christ in the headship over his body
[35:17] you think I'm beside myself I'm not
[35:20] we've got the devil's answer not me that
[35:23] liveth but Christ the word living in me
[35:27] so Satan's question that's why I was
[35:29] asking what's he saying the devil's
[35:31] question we've got the answer to the
[35:32] devil's question it's got to be related
[35:34] to Bringing doubts about is this real
[35:38] is this just a cult
[35:40] is is he really here
[35:43] the people of God say his headship is
[35:46] returned again and so his question are
[35:49] you really the one are you the bride
[35:51] receiving it but you see now if it's him
[35:53] and he's living his life through you the
[35:56] resurrected risen Christ and that
[35:59] Vindication is there living it out of
[36:01] your life that is the Vindication can
[36:03] you say amen and so if he has a question
[36:05] that's the answer to his question it's
[36:08] happening it's happening in me and I
[36:11] don't have to intellectually try to go
[36:13] go to bat with you to try to prove it
[36:15] any other way it will speak for itself
[36:18] in the bride's life
[36:24] we've got the devil's answer not me that
[36:27] liveth but Christ the word live within
[36:28] me it's not my idea it's his power not
[36:31] my idea it's his word that's why when
[36:33] you go at it intellectually with
[36:35] somebody that's a whole different ball
[36:37] game because this isn't based in
[36:39] intellectualism
[36:40] this that's why I like my daughter's
[36:42] song there uh here I stand
[36:45] his truth is what I follow it will still
[36:49] be true tomorrow what I believe is not
[36:52] the work of any man not even William
[36:54] Branham it's not the work of a man this
[36:58] is Christ the headship coming back into
[37:01] my life
[37:02] his truth is what I follow it'll still
[37:04] be true tomorrow what I believe is not
[37:07] the works of any man
[37:09] his kingdom can't be shaken
[37:11] on this solid foundation While others
[37:15] fall here I stand
[37:17] wonderful song Praise the Lord
[37:20] amen what I believe is not the works of
[37:22] any man it's not my idea it's his word
[37:26] he promised that here it is that's the
[37:29] answer to double questions he promised
[37:31] that he'd send a message and restore the
[37:33] word back to us and Satan here it is
[37:36] for 20 30 40 50 years seeing the
[37:39] manifestation of seeing the dead race if
[37:41] you're going on those things God will
[37:43] show himself the dead raised the blind
[37:45] eyes open the the cancer healed we've
[37:47] seen it identified over and over and
[37:49] over and over against and then not just
[37:52] that the character being molded in The
[37:54] Bride of Christ's character in her
[37:56] seeing the same Works in her this is
[37:59] happening and and that's what you tell
[38:01] the devil is that here it is it's
[38:03] happening it's manifesting don't look at
[38:06] the borderline Believers don't look at
[38:08] the carnal ones are not all in yet
[38:11] Satan would love to look at those and
[38:13] say well yeah this isn't the real thing
[38:15] no no no you better look at the people
[38:17] that have caught a revelation of this
[38:19] and you're seeing it in their lives
[38:22] devil you better look at them but he
[38:23] always wants to point to the borderline
[38:24] Believers they're not all in
[38:28] oh God help me
[38:31] Jesus described people like this as they
[38:34] honor me with their lips but their heart
[38:37] is far from me
[38:39] there's some people and their heart is
[38:40] not in this message sometimes even
[38:42] intending a message church only God
[38:44] knows where your heart is and he does
[38:46] know where your heart is but if you were
[38:48] to unveil it and peel back layers you
[38:49] see their lips are complementary and
[38:52] saying all the right things they need to
[38:54] see maybe they grew up in the message
[38:55] they know how to say all the right
[38:56] things in the message language
[38:59] but their heart is way far away from
[39:01] their heart being in this thing
[39:03] so I would encourage you it's
[39:05] manifesting time
[39:07] if you love the Lord get your heart
[39:09] where your mouth is
[39:14] it's time to get your heart where your
[39:16] mouth is don't be a pretender don't be a
[39:19] message believer just by wearing the
[39:21] right dress get your heart in this thing
[39:27] put your money where your mouth is I
[39:29] think that's a statement put your heart
[39:32] where your mouth is stop complimenting
[39:34] it and pretending and your heart if you
[39:37] were is not I just encourage you through
[39:40] a just a convicting thought this morning
[39:42] make sure your heart is in this thing
[39:47] I can't I can't
[39:49] take you in a Rapture on my coattail I
[39:52] can preach the word I can lead you into
[39:54] it but don't don't let your heart be if
[39:57] it were true your heart's away I I'm not
[39:59] believing this thing that's something to
[40:01] really hit the Altar and pray about
[40:04] I can't do that for you
[40:06] but Jesus said there are people whose
[40:09] lips honor me
[40:10] but because he can see that my their
[40:12] heart is far from Christ the word
[40:18] so he goes on to say and I'm finishing
[40:19] this up now he said it would be here
[40:21] here it is we got his answer
[40:23] we have Satan's answer God is
[40:25] vindicating himself God has proved
[40:26] himself to his promise in this day
[40:27] Hallelujah the headship is here amen
[40:30] Christ the Risen Lord is here in the
[40:31] same power of his resurrection that he
[40:33] ever was how many believe that today
[40:35] Christ is here with the same power as
[40:37] his resurrection that ever was before
[40:39] it's here now manifesting himself
[40:42] there's the devil's answer
[40:45] is there another one there
[40:51] no okay I'm done
[40:55] so he keeps you see both those
[40:57] statements keep popping up in Christ's
[40:59] mystery this is what Satan's howling at
[41:01] this is the answer to the devil's
[41:03] question this is what he's angry at this
[41:06] is the answer to the devil's question we
[41:07] have the answer to the devil's question
[41:09] it's possible that he in his anger
[41:13] is bringing questions and raising doubts
[41:16] and questions for you
[41:18] I wonder if that's the only thing and
[41:20] weapon that Satan has left
[41:23] just thinking out loud
[41:25] in front of a hundred and 20 people
[41:29] I wonder if he's getting more angry and
[41:31] the only thing is left to do is to raise
[41:34] questions that's his weapon
[41:37] is this real
[41:39] is this of man
[41:42] are you really the bride
[41:46] is this really him
[41:48] is this message to manifest Christ in
[41:51] the last days is it really
[41:53] we have the answer not because we say it
[41:56] but because we live in it
[41:59] the head the Holy Ghost is flowing
[42:03] through the body doing the same works
[42:06] and she stands unmovable in that
[42:08] Revelation that is him yes it's him if I
[42:11] were to answer the devil's question yes
[42:13] this is him this is not a man this is
[42:16] not William Bradham this is him Christ
[42:19] Our Lord doing this work by the Holy
[42:22] Ghost he is the head Satan this is your
[42:25] answer yes it is him he is the head here
[42:29] he is proving himself we are responding
[42:32] by saying the Risen Lord is here in the
[42:35] same power of his resurrection that he
[42:37] ever was manifesting himself
[42:42] that might need to be your answer
[42:44] tomorrow morning when he fights you
[42:47] it's pretty long but I can say it again
[42:50] our response is to say the Risen Lord is
[42:53] here in the same power of his
[42:55] resurrection that he ever was
[42:56] manifesting himself
[43:03] if the devil's question is is it really
[43:05] him yes it is this is him
[43:07] you're in trouble devil
[43:11] you know it's manifesting time
[43:14] what's in people is spilling out
[43:16] sometimes after 20 30 years things come
[43:18] out you never realize we're there the
[43:21] confession of their mouth is one thing
[43:22] but their heart is far from this message
[43:24] then it comes out what they are and all
[43:27] the words the world it's a coming out
[43:28] like all the perverts and coming out but
[43:31] there's another thing coming out
[43:33] manifested sons of God
[43:37] and they're saying Satan we're not
[43:40] bowing we're not bending and we're not
[43:44] burning
[43:46] like the Hebrew children I'm not going
[43:48] to bend I'm not going to Bow and I'm not
[43:50] going to burn
[43:52] I'm not going to stop praying even
[43:55] though I'm intimidated the prayers don't
[43:57] work somebody
[44:00] can I say this quote without it a a
[44:02] shallow person they would lose faith in
[44:04] this but I'm only quoting because a
[44:06] prophet who watched hundreds of
[44:08] thousands of Miracles and God manifest
[44:10] himself
[44:12] he said if I prayed for 20 000 people
[44:17] and they didn't get well they died the
[44:19] next morning
[44:20] he said I'd go back the next night and
[44:22] pray for another 20 000 people because
[44:24] this is not my word this is his word and
[44:28] my duty is to believe it
[44:32] is that a I can you can only say that to
[44:34] mature Believers because majorably
[44:36] mature Believers are saying to Satan
[44:37] listen I'm here for the duration of this
[44:40] thing I'm applying my faith that all
[44:42] things are possible with God
[44:45] I'm not going to believe the doctor's
[44:46] report I'm going to believe his report
[44:48] that's my duty I stand in his army I'm
[44:52] not wishy-washy that if he doesn't
[44:53] answer my prayer then I I may question
[44:56] this entire message no no no I'm here to
[44:58] stay whatever God does whatever is will
[45:01] but I believe he's able to heal the
[45:04] worst cancer I believe he's able to do
[45:07] what he said he would do
[45:09] that's my stance I'm not moving I'm not
[45:12] changing
[45:15] this is where I stand
[45:17] and the devil's going to know it every
[45:18] day
[45:20] I'm not going to stop praying I'm not
[45:21] going to stop believing I'm not going to
[45:23] be wishy-washy I'm not going to exit the
[45:26] very life of this word because some
[45:29] prayer may look like it doesn't get
[45:31] answered
[45:33] I love that lyric just get ready to sing
[45:35] that with my daughter
[45:37] Gabby
[45:40] I love you more by The Isaacs and it
[45:42] says
[45:44] it's not your fault Lord
[45:48] I won't blame you
[45:51] even though to me it looks like you
[45:53] didn't come through
[45:55] you must have known that I would get
[45:57] closer to you through this and the
[46:00] course says through it all I love you
[46:02] more now
[46:05] he doesn't always give us what we want
[46:07] but if it brings us to a deeper love for
[46:09] him
[46:10] he loves that
[46:12] is that okay to say to mature Believers
[46:14] this morning
[46:20] now
[46:21] in Jerusalem when these people gathered
[46:24] and
[46:25] the Persian king had given permission to
[46:28] Ezra and Nehemiah to go
[46:31] and rebuild the Temple and also rebuild
[46:33] the walls a Persian king
[46:35] release them and let them go back and to
[46:37] be able to build it and when they came
[46:40] back you know they realized you realize
[46:42] there was people there that didn't go
[46:44] down to Babylon there was a mixture of
[46:45] people there in Jerusalem there's such a
[46:48] mixture of all kinds of people once they
[46:50] got there for this final work of
[46:52] building the Temple rebuilding it
[46:53] rebuilding the walls uh the Heathen was
[46:56] there and some Jews that were there
[46:58] mixed with the Heathen they let their
[47:00] kids marry heathens and so because when
[47:03] you mix marriages like that you have a
[47:05] lot of different influences you have a
[47:06] lot of different
[47:07] mixed things the Jews that mixed with
[47:10] the other nations that were there and
[47:12] some of them worshiped Jehovah God but
[47:14] some of them were mixed up in idolatry
[47:15] so it was just a mixture but in the
[47:18] middle of all this in Jerusalem now was
[47:20] this people
[47:21] understorable under Ezra and under
[47:24] Nehemiah that caught the vision of this
[47:27] rebuilding and caught the vision that
[47:29] this God's behind this and the Persian
[47:32] king has given us permission to come
[47:34] back even help them a little bit
[47:35] financially to go back and read build
[47:37] the temple talk about God being in
[47:39] charge of worldly Kings
[47:43] it's like brother Ron said they're I
[47:45] think Saturday night it's not the
[47:47] presidents that control Our Lives
[47:50] it's not even them controlling their own
[47:52] lives it's God that's controlling what's
[47:54] going on
[47:55] praise the Lord and and so uh they had
[47:59] influences there but you see now these
[48:01] people caught the vision of God and this
[48:03] King had sent them back rebuild the
[48:05] Temple rebuilding the temple has to do
[48:07] with this restoration of Malachi 4 5 and
[48:10] 6 that in the end time I'll restore the
[48:12] faith and Pentecost I'll restore the
[48:14] truths that were lost I restore the
[48:16] faith that's in the people I restore
[48:18] them back to Pentecost again in the end
[48:20] time under Malachi 4 who was a a type of
[48:23] a a a zerubbabel zoruba was the type of
[48:26] Malachi four five and six in the
[48:28] rebuilding he'd come back and bring the
[48:29] word back to the people bring the true
[48:31] experience of the baptism the Holy Ghost
[48:33] back to the people again they would be
[48:35] restored that's the rebuilding of the
[48:36] temple today because we are his dimple
[48:39] we are his Stones can you say them out
[48:41] so now this rebuilding is that and
[48:43] there's only a small amount of people
[48:44] caught the vision of why we go to church
[48:49] cultivision of Why We Gather cultivision
[48:51] of why we're here but others didn't
[48:53] catch it and guess what the other ones
[48:55] that didn't catch it are going to start
[48:56] persecuting now and getting angry at
[48:59] those that are starting to rebuild the
[49:01] Temple and build these walls
[49:02] there's an increased anger and there's
[49:05] really no explanation why they got angry
[49:07] if there's Jews there even if they're
[49:08] mixed they actually should be rejoicing
[49:10] that the work of rebuilding the temple
[49:13] they should be shouting and rejoicing
[49:15] just like all the rest it's strange why
[49:18] are they becoming angry at their
[49:20] brothers building the work of the Lord
[49:24] I don't have the answer to that except
[49:25] for Satan always gets upset of the
[49:28] promised word of the age and to rebuild
[49:31] that Temple was the promised word of the
[49:33] age and Satan always is mad at that
[49:38] so they begin working by the vision and
[49:40] by what God told them to do they said
[49:42] this is God's Temple and and so now but
[49:45] but we must go deeper than just the
[49:47] temple we must build the walls I got a
[49:49] little sermon on that is that the
[49:51] finished work is not just the temple was
[49:53] rebuilt and the faith is restored back
[49:55] to Pentecost but the walls are the
[49:57] protection in place
[49:59] David said it when he repented Lord God
[50:02] forgive me
[50:05] apply the hyssop to my life his adultery
[50:07] that he did it's in Psalms where he
[50:10] repents I forget the psalm now but he
[50:12] repents and in his repentance the last
[50:14] thing he says he says build the walls of
[50:16] Jerusalem
[50:17] so it's not just being forgiven it's not
[50:21] just being restored it's not just coming
[50:23] from the world and your life being
[50:25] changed and you become a temple of God
[50:27] by the Holy Ghost but the final stage is
[50:30] him saying Lord build the walls of
[50:32] Jerusalem if you had a city and a temple
[50:35] without any walls the enemy could try to
[50:37] get in so when Christians go deeper in
[50:39] their lives they're not just have they
[50:42] don't just have the Holy Ghost they're
[50:43] not just a temple of the Holy Ghost but
[50:45] they say God let me go deeper and let me
[50:48] build walls of protection that the devil
[50:51] doesn't know how to get in
[50:53] that's where you find this Prophet
[50:55] saying that I'm so glad a man can live
[50:58] so close to God the desert devil doesn't
[51:00] know how to get in and doesn't have a
[51:02] place to get in
[51:04] so the walls were important and that
[51:06] this is the final stages let's build the
[51:09] walls let's do this they caught the
[51:11] final Vision let's go deeper I don't
[51:14] know what you're doing but the people of
[51:16] God say I want to go deeper take me
[51:18] deeper
[51:20] not everybody had that vision
[51:23] that did not stir some people up like it
[51:26] stirred some of the Believers up
[51:28] some were adversaries and guess what
[51:30] they never give a reason why they're
[51:33] becoming angry and adversary to it they
[51:35] were just the first thing they did is
[51:37] they began to mock it they begin to mock
[51:39] the people of God and they said lies
[51:41] against it the people of God had to work
[51:44] in the middle of being mocked and put
[51:47] down
[51:49] so I'm bringing this to a close in a
[51:52] minute what's our response to this anger
[51:55] because if you haven't experienced it
[51:57] yet
[51:59] then I say to you
[52:01] maybe you're not living close enough to
[52:03] the Lord
[52:04] because if you're really saying Lord I
[52:06] want to be filled with the spirit every
[52:08] day and I want to be living close to you
[52:11] get ready
[52:14] now some years I'm running off I don't
[52:16] want to do that
[52:19] but there's got to be reasons for that
[52:21] if you're living and standing for this
[52:24] message
[52:25] not the Intel not intellectually but by
[52:28] the whole ghost we're standing and we're
[52:30] believing this is Christ's headship
[52:32] returned to us
[52:33] get ready
[52:35] I can't believe it hasn't happened to
[52:36] you yet I can ask her to show hands but
[52:39] the devil's anger is increasing against
[52:41] me
[52:43] he's trying to strike my family
[52:46] he's trying to strike
[52:49] he's taken a final swing
[52:52] but I'm not afraid
[52:58] so they're mocking the people of God
[53:00] number two notice they never formed an
[53:02] army and fought against samblet and
[53:04] tobiah
[53:05] it just kept building oh there's an army
[53:08] being formed we got to they did get
[53:10] their swords together for protection but
[53:12] it's not they say we're going to go off
[53:13] of the building now and we're going to
[53:15] start fighting they didn't even do that
[53:16] they just kept building God will fight
[53:18] our battles God will step in for us and
[53:20] that's what he did they they stopped
[53:22] they said we're not going to do it it
[53:23] was just a threat isn't that like the
[53:25] Devil he's just a threat
[53:27] it's just to scare you I'm gonna do this
[53:30] if you keep going this way I'm going to
[53:31] do this but yet you got a bigger God
[53:33] that steps in and says no you're not
[53:36] going to do that
[53:37] Hallelujah
[53:39] vengeance is mine saith the Lord leave
[53:41] the Vengeance to him as our brother
[53:43] preached last Sunday this is a time of
[53:46] war and God has an Armory and he'll pull
[53:48] out all the weapons he needs
[53:51] and you might be one of those weapons if
[53:52] he needs you be available to him God
[53:54] you're pulling on me to be faith for
[53:56] someone else who needs Faith I'll be
[53:58] that weapon that you pull out and use
[53:59] but God is a man of war and you our
[54:02] captain is the Lord if he asks us to
[54:04] fight that's one thing but ultimately if
[54:07] Satan starts to gloat if Satan starts to
[54:09] threaten if he starts to make you afraid
[54:12] then that's really all he wants to do is
[54:13] to make you afraid but we should not be
[54:16] afraid you you should say Satan God is
[54:19] my captain of this Army and if you're
[54:21] having trouble with me then your habit
[54:23] you're going to get in trouble with my
[54:25] God
[54:27] glory be to God
[54:29] your problem is it with me Satan you you
[54:31] touched me you touch not my anointed and
[54:35] do my prophets no harm
[54:37] God said don't touch my anointed or I'll
[54:40] step in I've removed armies I've opened
[54:42] up Red Seas I've done what I have to do
[54:45] because he says don't touch my anointed
[54:49] you don't have to fight the battle
[54:51] yourself brother and sister this morning
[54:54] we're not fighting alone
[54:56] we have a captain
[54:58] and you know they didn't form an army
[55:00] and fight against Samuel they just kept
[55:02] building they kept focused I think
[55:03] that's nice simple answer to you today
[55:05] just stay focused on the word of God
[55:07] stay in it every day
[55:10] become a prayer Warrior say well I don't
[55:12] have a position in the church let me
[55:15] give you a position
[55:16] become a prayer Warrior like brother Jim
[55:19] back here
[55:20] and sister Julie I know they are I
[55:23] couldn't I've got about I don't know I I
[55:25] know a lot of you pray for me but
[55:26] there's some prayer warriors that know
[55:28] how to bombard heaven
[55:31] and I could not make it keep him
[55:32] preaching unless I had them behind me
[55:36] say I don't have a position why don't
[55:38] you become a silent prayer Warrior and
[55:40] know how to bombard heaven
[55:43] greatest position you take and there's
[55:45] some there's some opportunities
[55:46] available there's some slots open
[55:49] because we're going to need more prayer
[55:51] with what's coming up than ever before
[55:53] what do you need in the church brother
[55:55] Paul you need somebody to wash the
[55:56] toilets well we might but we need Holy
[55:59] Ghost filled prayer warriors more than
[56:01] anything else
[56:02] [Applause]
[56:04] I need people to stop worrying about the
[56:07] fusses in the church I need people to
[56:09] get filled with the spirit and get ready
[56:11] for what's coming ahead
[56:15] that's what we need in the church
[56:18] Hallelujah they stayed focused they they
[56:21] just dealt there with that contrary
[56:23] spirit always laying there it's always
[56:25] there it always will be there at
[56:27] contrary Spirit but stay focused on the
[56:29] work of the Lord samblet means sin and
[56:31] tobiah means Jehovah is good which is
[56:33] really strange samblet means sin and
[56:36] tobiah means Jehovah is good these two
[56:38] influences con are contrary to the
[56:41] deeper walk of the Lord in you sin is
[56:44] your is contrary and someone who just
[56:46] wants to see Jehovah as a good God
[56:50] not a God of War
[56:52] not a god of overcoming but just a good
[56:56] God
[56:57] brother Paul why can't you just I bring
[56:59] visitors here why can't you just be nice
[57:04] he's a good God just preach the good
[57:07] things
[57:12] he is a good god
[57:14] I believe that
[57:16] but he's a man of war
[57:18] he's a man of Justice
[57:21] he's a man that tells the truth
[57:24] Christ is one who tells us Christ is the
[57:27] very essence of Truth so if you get
[57:28] around Christ you're going to hear truth
[57:30] might take the very height off you but
[57:33] you're going to hear truth not just that
[57:35] he's a good God you're a good boy you're
[57:37] a good little boy you're okay
[57:38] everybody's they're doing you wrong
[57:40] you're a victim of everybody I'm not
[57:42] going to continue to make you a victim
[57:43] because victims victims that are getting
[57:46] the Holy Ghost are rising above
[57:47] victimhood today is that anybody can do
[57:50] anything they want you that's their
[57:52] problem I'm going to go on serving the
[57:53] lord I will not encourage your victim
[57:56] ism
[57:57] the government will
[58:00] but Christ doesn't
[58:01] I've been done wrong by every church
[58:03] I've been to brother Paul
[58:09] and I'm thinking this one's going to do
[58:11] me wrong just like all the rest of them
[58:14] victim
[58:17] time to grow up
[58:19] trying to become a warrior
[58:22] time to get back on building the kingdom
[58:24] and the walls and this finishing work
[58:26] there's so much to do for the kingdom of
[58:28] God and that's why these fusses even
[58:30] around our ranks and in the message and
[58:31] who the greatest preacher is and all the
[58:33] greatest revivals just I want to stay
[58:35] out of it because I got a work to do
[58:37] here we got something to do here you've
[58:39] got something to do quit getting online
[58:42] and doing all the fusses there's a work
[58:44] to do here
[58:46] I'm not going to have a two-hour
[58:47] conversation with somebody who's trying
[58:49] to to to to
[58:51] de-establish everything that's in me
[58:53] saying amen and try to de-establish that
[58:55] I've got too much to do for the kingdom
[58:57] to do that
[59:02] I respect you I'll shake your hand I
[59:05] respect you whatever you want to believe
[59:07] that's fine because I have a right to
[59:08] believe whatever I believe but don't
[59:10] waste my time when I know there's good
[59:13] things to do for the kingdom of God
[59:21] trying to find the reason why tobiah and
[59:24] Sam Billet were contrary as Samuel and
[59:27] Tobias had positions maybe maybe they
[59:30] were jealous that the king never gave
[59:32] them positions in this I don't know why
[59:34] they were so angry
[59:37] but
[59:40] they were grieved that someone was
[59:42] seeking the welfare of the Jews maybe
[59:44] they could have been jealous could be
[59:46] they were not put in charge of it and
[59:48] Samuel and tobiah why didn't this King
[59:51] who's our King put us in charge of this
[59:53] work maybe they were jealous of that
[59:57] we were not informed
[1:00:02] maybe they were mad because I was not
[1:00:05] informed of this myself
[1:00:07] we didn't vote on that
[1:00:12] I don't know
[1:00:13] but they got the angry of the devil
[1:00:15] against the wrong people
[1:00:17] the people that are trying to do the
[1:00:19] final work of the Lord
[1:00:21] you can be angry at a lot of people but
[1:00:23] don't be angry at those
[1:00:27] don't be angry at the preachers that
[1:00:28] preached the
[1:00:30] clear gospel in the message and with
[1:00:32] without holding back that's not the
[1:00:34] person to make your children angry at
[1:00:37] everybody listening this morning
[1:00:39] he's not your enemy he's your friend
[1:00:42] I'm not your enemy I'm your friend
[1:00:47] I'm not perfect I don't do everything
[1:00:49] just right and I don't make all the
[1:00:51] administrative decisions that you may
[1:00:52] agree with I'm sorry about that but
[1:00:55] there's a bigger calling there's a
[1:00:56] bigger office here
[1:00:58] can you say man and if you if you
[1:01:01] respect it
[1:01:02] brother Brown says God's ordained for
[1:01:05] that Pastor to lead you through to the
[1:01:06] other side
[1:01:08] so the office is that you don't want to
[1:01:10] make that office and the leadership of
[1:01:12] that church and everybody your enemy in
[1:01:15] your eyes of your children you don't
[1:01:17] want to do that there's a lot of people
[1:01:18] to warn them against but it's not the
[1:01:21] True Church of God
[1:01:24] be angry at something else be angry at
[1:01:26] the Devil
[1:01:31] these are not in my notes it's just my
[1:01:33] heart
[1:01:37] they could have been jealous the facts
[1:01:39] are if you develop a resentment and
[1:01:42] brother Stephen preached on that last
[1:01:43] year last week brother Steve Caruso
[1:01:46] mentioned resentment and bitterness if
[1:01:48] you develop a resentment no matter how
[1:01:51] right you are
[1:01:52] you keep that resentment and bitterness
[1:01:55] you're on your way out
[1:01:57] God can't bless you if you're filled
[1:02:00] with resentment and bitterness
[1:02:03] and wrath and wrath and anger and built
[1:02:05] up
[1:02:06] God can't use you for the work of the
[1:02:08] Lord
[1:02:10] so they became Roth at this work of God
[1:02:13] they misread what was being done so they
[1:02:16] laughed at them they pronounced doom on
[1:02:17] that they they said they will go no
[1:02:19] farther this isn't this is nothing this
[1:02:21] is a cult movement it's all going to
[1:02:23] fizzle out
[1:02:26] and their response was from Nehemiah
[1:02:28] listen this is God's work
[1:02:30] if it is God's work he will prosper it
[1:02:33] if it's not God's work it won't
[1:02:36] if you're called to this
[1:02:38] and you have a part in it that's fine
[1:02:40] otherwise leave us alone let us build
[1:02:44] his response was not the same as they
[1:02:46] were dishing out mocking slinging mud
[1:02:49] back at them defending themselves it
[1:02:51] doesn't do any good to fight argument
[1:02:53] with argument
[1:02:55] it doesn't do any good to sling mud to
[1:02:57] the ones who are singing mud at you
[1:02:59] what Nehemiah said listen if you don't
[1:03:01] call to this that's fine God bless you
[1:03:03] we'll be brothers Sling all the money
[1:03:05] you want but I'm not going to sling mud
[1:03:07] back at you I'm not going to defend
[1:03:08] myself God has given me my commission
[1:03:11] can you say Amen there's a work of God
[1:03:14] to do and we want to do it leave us
[1:03:15] alone and let us do this work can you
[1:03:18] say Amen this morning
[1:03:20] the next time
[1:03:22] they said nothing back to them
[1:03:25] and you have to read this in the story I
[1:03:26] read most of it you just read these
[1:03:28] these efforts to to be angry and to stop
[1:03:31] the work of God the next time they made
[1:03:33] an effort nothing was said back Nehemiah
[1:03:36] said we're just going to pray
[1:03:38] and sometimes that's what that's how you
[1:03:41] respond
[1:03:42] there is no response I'm I'm going to
[1:03:45] pray
[1:03:46] has everybody learned that today
[1:03:52] you got to have faith in your prayer
[1:03:53] brother and sister
[1:03:55] the effectual prayer of a righteous man
[1:03:57] availeth much
[1:03:59] and then then the prophet said well you
[1:04:01] feel unworthy to pray well Elijah was a
[1:04:03] man subject to like passions as we are
[1:04:05] he was really like us as a human but God
[1:04:08] heard his prayer so righteousness is not
[1:04:11] based upon your righteousness that I
[1:04:12] that I haven't made any mistakes so I
[1:04:14] have a right to pray pray for anyone no
[1:04:16] no it's it's that your righteousness is
[1:04:18] in what he did for you at the cross it's
[1:04:21] in Christ and so with that you are
[1:04:23] worthy you do have a right to pray you
[1:04:25] do have a right for ask for anything no
[1:04:27] matter how high it is you have a right
[1:04:29] to ask for it
[1:04:31] don't underestimate the power of your
[1:04:33] prayer before the Lord the effectual
[1:04:35] fervent prayer Avail as much can you
[1:04:37] saith man amen and so now we see then
[1:04:40] that we're gonna uh form an Harmony and
[1:04:43] their response was to protect but not to
[1:04:45] fight back I got to get through this now
[1:04:46] I realize I'm going over time to protect
[1:04:48] with a sword in one hand but not the
[1:04:51] building in another hand
[1:04:53] why did they do that
[1:04:55] because I think it's wrong to let
[1:04:57] someone try to destroy what God has
[1:04:59] built in you refuse to let the adversary
[1:05:02] destroy what he's built in you and me we
[1:05:05] will not let them bring our spirit down
[1:05:07] with guilt and mocking or their anger
[1:05:10] can you say Amen
[1:05:12] that this in me is not destructible
[1:05:15] because God put it in me I'm not uh I'm
[1:05:19] not in a cult someone that says that
[1:05:21] it's just a crazy conclusion so you
[1:05:24] protect yourself from those voices with
[1:05:27] a sword in one hand and building this
[1:05:30] this temple in another hand this walls
[1:05:33] but if you spend hours forming a fight
[1:05:35] against them then the building stops the
[1:05:37] finishing work stops the work of the
[1:05:39] Lord stops let's stay on the work of the
[1:05:41] Lord can you say Amen let's not let
[1:05:43] anything distract us from the work of
[1:05:45] the Lord
[1:05:46] the last effort I don't know if you read
[1:05:48] your Bible I didn't read it this morning
[1:05:49] but it's in there the last effort they
[1:05:52] gave to come against the work of the
[1:05:54] Lord was they called
[1:05:57] Nehemiah samuelit and Nehemiah and said
[1:06:00] could we get together in the village
[1:06:03] and I like the word this way can we just
[1:06:06] have a coffee and talk
[1:06:13] try every means
[1:06:15] I mean this is the same guy who was
[1:06:17] putting together an army to fight
[1:06:18] against them this is the same guy that
[1:06:21] mocked him him and Tobi the same guy who
[1:06:23] gossiped against them the same one now
[1:06:25] says can we have coffee and just talk
[1:06:28] you know what Nehemiah said no we can't
[1:06:34] people get quiet
[1:06:39] but I've had to tell some people
[1:06:40] sometimes it seems impolite say you know
[1:06:43] I'd love to fellowship around the word
[1:06:44] but when the motive is there and I can
[1:06:47] see it
[1:06:48] Nehemiah said I'll read it to you no I
[1:06:52] won't be able to go
[1:06:54] he says oh I'm in Revelations and not
[1:06:57] Nehemiah
[1:06:58] you got to hear his response to this
[1:07:01] he says samblet and geisham said unto
[1:07:04] him saying come and let us meet together
[1:07:05] in some one of these Villages at
[1:07:07] Starbucks
[1:07:13] let's meet at Starbucks and just discuss
[1:07:16] this now this is the same guy that
[1:07:17] wanted to destroy you
[1:07:20] let's have a coffee at Starbucks it
[1:07:23] doesn't say that
[1:07:25] but they thought but they thought to do
[1:07:27] me Mischief so now he's calling it
[1:07:29] mischief
[1:07:30] and I sent Messengers to them saying I
[1:07:34] am doing a great work
[1:07:36] so that I cannot come down to Starbucks
[1:07:40] [Applause]
[1:07:44] why should the work cease
[1:07:47] while I leave it and come to Starbucks
[1:07:50] with you
[1:07:55] that seems harsh that seems but listen
[1:07:57] if someone's got a sincere heart and
[1:08:00] want a fellowship around the world and
[1:08:01] sincere questions I'm all there
[1:08:04] but when there's a track record that
[1:08:06] shows listen I'm not going to be drawn
[1:08:09] away from the work of the Lord and
[1:08:10] people's lives that I need to pour
[1:08:12] myself into
[1:08:19] yet they sent unto me four times an
[1:08:23] invitation to Starbucks
[1:08:27] and I answered them after the same
[1:08:30] manner
[1:08:34] the devil is becoming more and more
[1:08:36] angry
[1:08:37] and when he they have the swords
[1:08:40] and God backed them off
[1:08:44] and the people of God had the swords
[1:08:45] they kept working on the Lord he got
[1:08:47] more angry and said they're not going to
[1:08:49] stop they're not going to stop doing
[1:08:50] what they're doing and he became more
[1:08:52] festering and more angry or angry until
[1:08:55] he tried other means and everything and
[1:08:58] as I said at the beginning
[1:09:00] after a while you have to say this is
[1:09:02] not a problem with me as much as it is
[1:09:04] it's a problem with their anger
[1:09:07] and they need to resolve their anger
[1:09:09] if you have anger this morning you
[1:09:11] better resolve your anger
[1:09:14] you better bring that to the to the
[1:09:16] cross
[1:09:18] because the devil will use that he'll
[1:09:19] take his anger with your anger and it's
[1:09:22] not good
[1:09:24] so we release it forgive we let it go
[1:09:27] because I want to be doing the work of
[1:09:28] the Lord I don't want to spend my whole
[1:09:30] life in anger I don't want to spend my
[1:09:31] whole life participating in coming
[1:09:34] against the word of God I want to be the
[1:09:36] ones that's in the army of God
[1:09:38] identifying myself I'm all in I'm part
[1:09:40] of the army of the Lord I'm part of the
[1:09:42] solution not the problem
[1:09:45] part of the solution and part of the
[1:09:47] Kingdom I'm part of what God's trying to
[1:09:49] achieve here I want to be a part of that
[1:09:51] the old lady she's at the end of the
[1:09:53] line with all the soldiers with their
[1:09:54] guns and he the the the commander comes
[1:09:58] down and sees them all perfect in order
[1:09:59] and Grandma's down Grandma's down at the
[1:10:01] end with her broom and her dress and at
[1:10:04] the end with her broom and standing at
[1:10:06] attention like the rest of the soldiers
[1:10:08] what are you doing here
[1:10:12] you can't fight with these men you can't
[1:10:15] do that I know but I just wanted to let
[1:10:18] all you know whose side I'm on
[1:10:23] amen
[1:10:26] sometimes you can't tell which side
[1:10:29] people are on
[1:10:30] but we ought to make a bold statement
[1:10:32] whose side we're on I'm on the Lord's
[1:10:34] Side I'm for the work of the Lord we're
[1:10:37] finishing this work brother Wallace
[1:10:39] we're finishing this work didn't Jesus
[1:10:41] say it my meat is to finish the work of
[1:10:44] the Lord that he gave me to do and I'm
[1:10:46] going to here to finish the job I like
[1:10:49] what brother Tim Pruitt said Friday
[1:10:50] night he was talking about the building
[1:10:52] all these other things and the
[1:10:53] dedication of that building and we're
[1:10:55] the temples of God wonderful message and
[1:10:57] he says he says Saints he said God gave
[1:10:59] us this work to finish then let's finish
[1:11:01] it let's finish this work
[1:11:03] let's get it done can you say man praise
[1:11:06] be to God
[1:11:07] our response to Satan's anger is that
[1:11:10] I'm going to keep praying
[1:11:12] our response to Satan's anger is that
[1:11:15] I'm going to keep loving our response to
[1:11:18] Satan's anger is not more anger but our
[1:11:20] response that I believe this message
[1:11:21] with all my heart our response to
[1:11:24] Satan's anger is to say I don't have
[1:11:26] time to spend countless hours doubting
[1:11:28] this message I've got a work to do here
[1:11:30] and I'm going to stay on the wall I'm
[1:11:32] going to keep building I'm going to keep
[1:11:34] praying my children onto the Holy Ghost
[1:11:35] I'm going to keep loving can you say
[1:11:37] Amen I'm going to keep applying the
[1:11:39] token I'm going to keep him in the word
[1:11:41] of God I'm going to grab my Bible every
[1:11:43] day and read my Bible and pray because
[1:11:44] the prophet said you want to get closer
[1:11:46] to God read my Bible and pray my
[1:11:49] response to Satan's anger is that I'm
[1:11:50] going to be in the word more and in my
[1:11:52] phone less
[1:11:54] Hallelujah
[1:11:56] my response to the devil's anger is I'm
[1:11:59] going to be on the in the word more
[1:12:01] instead of on my computer more
[1:12:03] that's my response to the devil
[1:12:07] I'm going to participate in good
[1:12:09] Fellowship
[1:12:11] positive Fellowship
[1:12:13] instead of the wrong kind
[1:12:15] that's my response to Satan's anger and
[1:12:17] to say he gave me this revelation
[1:12:21] Satan can't take it away
[1:12:25] he gave me this and Satan can't take it
[1:12:28] away I don't know where you feel you are
[1:12:30] today in the Lord
[1:12:31] but I'm going to give that most of you
[1:12:34] are sitting here because something has
[1:12:36] been deposited in your heart that you
[1:12:38] know had to come from God
[1:12:40] you may not feel like you're all where
[1:12:42] you need to be
[1:12:43] but
[1:12:44] if you can say that something is in your
[1:12:48] heart that's come from God and not
[1:12:49] yourself and he deposited in there even
[1:12:52] it was 20 years ago even it was the last
[1:12:54] week if you can say that then you have
[1:12:56] enough response to the devil to say
[1:12:59] you didn't give that to me
[1:13:02] and Satan you can't take it away
[1:13:06] amen come on brother Kenny
[1:13:11] you didn't give it to me and you can't
[1:13:13] take it away and what God has joined
[1:13:16] together let no man put asunder
[1:13:20] this Union this headship and this bride
[1:13:23] in this body is a work of the Lord you
[1:13:25] know what it says later in Nehemiah even
[1:13:28] sambalit and tobiah and the enemies come
[1:13:31] back later and said they said this they
[1:13:34] had to confess this is a work that's
[1:13:36] been wrought in God
[1:13:39] they said that and one day even the
[1:13:42] enemy is going to testify I was fighting
[1:13:45] against the wrong thing because this was
[1:13:47] not wrought in those people this wasn't
[1:13:49] me this isn't brother branham's message
[1:13:52] this was a work wrought in God and it's
[1:13:55] proved it you say Vindication it's been
[1:13:57] Vindicated but the final Vindication is
[1:13:59] coming more and more and the Bible says
[1:14:02] someday every knee shall bow and every
[1:14:07] tongue will have to confess that Jesus
[1:14:09] is Lord
[1:14:11] every one of them they had to say this
[1:14:14] work was wrought in God
[1:14:17] read it this week in your Bible it's
[1:14:19] wonderful to see that the enemy will
[1:14:21] someday have to testify
[1:14:24] this is not
[1:14:26] wrought in God I've got a revelation of
[1:14:29] predestination
[1:14:31] I've got a revelation God is my father
[1:14:33] sister Sharon wrote this song years ago
[1:14:40] I've got a rest let's Stand Together
[1:14:43] Worship the Lord
[1:14:44] [Music]
[1:14:49] got a
[1:14:51] revelation God is my father
[1:14:55] [Music]
[1:14:57] I know where
[1:14:59] I came from tells me where

[1:16:24] Satan can't move a man with a true
[1:16:26] revelation
[1:16:27] I like that brother sister Wallace here
[1:16:29] look at their lives and faithful
[1:16:31] faithful
[1:16:33] since before I was born
[1:16:36] faithful to the Lord they know what the
[1:16:38] power of the Holy Ghost can do
[1:16:40] no they know what a Believer surrendered
[1:16:42] to the Lord what it means and the devil
[1:16:44] today would like to say well the the day
[1:16:46] has changed it's a different time
[1:16:49] different age you know modern no no no
[1:16:51] no Holy Ghost is still the same someone
[1:16:53] filled with it acts the same way and
[1:16:56] they're going to come to adoption
[1:16:57] they're going to come to their place and
[1:16:59] that's the person the devil is afraid of
[1:17:02] that's the young person the devil's
[1:17:03] afraid of he's not afraid of you for
[1:17:06] anything he's afraid when you get filled
[1:17:07] with the spirit of God before we pray
[1:17:10] today you have to look at your life and
[1:17:11] say God knows
[1:17:14] exactly where I'm at right now
[1:17:17] if my heart is far from him God knows
[1:17:20] that
[1:17:21] if your heart is close it doesn't matter
[1:17:22] where you're at what you've been through
[1:17:24] you have to rest and start here God
[1:17:27] knows where I'm at but he also knows
[1:17:30] where to get me from where where I'm at
[1:17:33] to the next place so that I love him
[1:17:36] more I may believe that today
[1:17:38] how many believe God knows where you're
[1:17:40] at and he doesn't condemn you where
[1:17:41] you're at he convicts you probably a lot
[1:17:43] of you felt conviction today but he
[1:17:45] doesn't condemn you but he knows where
[1:17:47] you're at okay
[1:17:49] he knows if there's bitterness whatever
[1:17:51] he knows but he also how many raisins he
[1:17:53] knows how to get me from where I'm at to
[1:17:55] being closer to him if you know that you
[1:17:57] can speak to him today yourself I don't
[1:18:00] have to pray that prayer for you father
[1:18:02] I pray that you will anoint and bless
[1:18:04] the ears that I've heard this morning
[1:18:07] and if there is a person whose lips are
[1:18:10] confessing you but their heart is a long
[1:18:13] ways away for whatever reason I pray
[1:18:15] that you'll love them by the word of
