[0:00] i'm a title
[0:02] my preaching of this sermon
[0:05] the vision
[0:07] the vision not the vision
[0:10] the vision
[0:12] because i know where there's no vision
[0:14] there's a division
[0:17] so proverbs 29 18
[0:21] where there is no vision
[0:24] the people perish
[0:28] but that
[0:29] but he that keeps the law happy
[0:32] is he
[0:34] i'd like to see what the niv
[0:37] it says
[0:39] the new international
[0:41] version
[0:42] where there is no
[0:44] revelation
[0:49] i want that to soak in a little bit but
[0:51] there's no revelation
[0:53] people have no restraint
[0:56] why
[0:57] because
[0:58] if there's no vision you're blind
[1:01] people that don't know where they're
[1:02] going
[1:03] they go everywhere
[1:05] if you don't have a target to hit you
[1:07] can shoot anywhere you want to
[1:09] and you can hit everybody
[1:11] on the way too
[1:14] if you don't have a objective
[1:16] you don't have a goal
[1:19] so where you gonna go
[1:20] any way you like to
[1:23] so
[1:24] there's no restraint but bless is the
[1:26] man who
[1:28] he says
[1:30] his wisdom and instruction
[1:33] this is what brother branham says in the
[1:34] disposition of the seven eight churches
[1:38] he says
[1:39] no man knows
[1:40] the things of god
[1:42] so we're going to have revelation
[1:43] because nobody knows
[1:46] he says nobody knows the things of god
[1:48] save
[1:49] the spirit of god and he
[1:52] to whom the spirit of god
[1:54] reveals
[1:56] so he decides who
[1:58] he wants to rebuild things
[2:00] that is his prerogative
[2:03] so we need to call on god
[2:06] for revelation more
[2:08] than anything else in
[2:11] the
[2:12] world
[2:16] and the bride loves revelation
[2:18] and we need it
[2:20] it's not a 40 years ago but i had a
[2:22] revelation
[2:23] what about today
[2:26] because revelation is a vision
[2:29] so every day you have to be from glory
[2:32] to glory you're moving towards the
[2:34] vision but it has to be by revelation
[2:38] that you're moving towards the vision
[2:41] it is not something that we just figure
[2:42] out
[2:44] but today i'm going to do this
[2:46] you know this is a good day to go to
[2:47] church
[2:48] well you know that's you know humanly
[2:51] speaking
[2:52] you cannot make yourself come to church
[2:55] if god don't give you the revelation and
[2:56] the desire to come to church you won't
[2:58] come to church
[3:00] because
[3:02] god would not share his glory with no
[3:04] human being
[3:06] it is all him or nothing
[3:09] he says
[3:10] revelation more than anything else
[3:12] we have accepted the bible
[3:15] we have accepted the great truth
[3:18] but still it's not real
[3:21] i want you to think about those words
[3:23] what i'm
[3:24] preaching real
[3:26] to most people because the revelation
[3:29] but the spirit is not there
[3:33] so we have
[3:35] the bible says we have people
[3:37] that have a form
[3:39] of godliness
[3:41] you know this law a lot of churches
[3:43] today they have a form of godliness even
[3:46] in the message
[3:48] nothing wrong with the form the former
[3:50] godliness is okay
[3:53] it has to be
[3:55] because the bible says jesus said it
[3:56] will be so close
[3:58] so close that if it was possible it will
[4:01] deceive the very elect
[4:05] the form of godliness is real close so
[4:08] close
[4:09] that by your naked eye you can decide
[4:12] which way to go unless
[4:14] by the spirit of god you are led
[4:18] so the form of godliness
[4:21] is
[4:23] so close
[4:25] so therefore
[4:27] what's the difference
[4:29] the bible said
[4:30] the form of godliness denying the power
[4:35] of the what
[4:37] of the spirit
[4:39] they have
[4:41] are worshipping god
[4:43] they're praying to god they're reading
[4:45] the bible
[4:46] they're doing everything you do they're
[4:47] casting out demons people are getting
[4:49] healed miracles supernaturals that all
[4:52] happen in idea
[4:54] see the same form of godliness
[4:57] however they don't have the power
[5:01] to change
[5:03] they don't have the power for that word
[5:05] that they're preaching
[5:06] to change them to the world
[5:11] so that's why we need revelation
[5:14] you come to church and without
[5:15] revelation
[5:16] it becomes it becomes a verse
[5:19] when i was a baptist that's what i did
[5:22] i can't quote you all the verses they
[5:24] help me that they show me how to testify
[5:27] and what to memorize you know
[5:30] when i go and witness to people
[5:32] but that was just word
[5:35] that was just word
[5:36] it was no life into it
[5:39] because the word without the spirit
[5:41] is not life is dead in
[5:44] actuality the bible said the word by
[5:46] himself will it kill it
[5:50] if you the letter the word by himself
[5:53] will kill you
[5:55] so i don't want to be sitting down there
[5:57] it's coming out of the pulpit i don't
[5:59] want to be alive but it's killing me why
[6:02] because no spirit
[6:05] the spirit has to give you the
[6:06] revelation of that word
[6:08] or we come in and we go out the same way
[6:11] even worse
[6:12] because we pick up a few spirits
[6:15] in the way
[6:17] he says
[6:19] we have accepted the bible we have
[6:21] accepted the great truth but it still is
[6:23] not real
[6:25] to most people because the revelation by
[6:28] the spirit is not there
[6:32] it says
[6:33] the word has
[6:34] not been
[6:36] quickened
[6:38] see
[6:40] says the bible says in ii corinthians 5
[6:43] 21 that we have become
[6:46] the righteousness of god by our union
[6:49] with jesus christ did you get it
[6:52] it says
[6:53] that we are
[6:54] the very righteousness of god
[6:58] himself
[7:00] by
[7:01] by being in christ it says that jesus
[7:05] he jesus became sin for us
[7:08] it does not said he became sinful
[7:11] but becomes sin
[7:13] for us that by our union with him we
[7:16] might become
[7:17] the righteousness of god
[7:21] if we accept the fact
[7:23] and we must
[7:24] that he literally became seen for us
[7:28] by his substitution for us then
[7:31] we must also accept the fact that we by
[7:34] our our union with him have become the
[7:38] very
[7:39] righteousness of god
[7:42] you cannot have it both ways
[7:44] he forgave my sin
[7:46] yeah but you god in flesh
[7:49] it is his heartiness
[7:52] to reject one is to reject the other one
[7:56] to accept one is to accept the other one
[7:59] now
[8:00] we know that the bible says that it
[8:03] cannot be denying but the revelation
[8:07] it is missing
[8:09] the revelation is always missing
[8:12] the spirit that come and quicken
[8:14] that word in our bodies
[8:16] in the meantime we just sit there yeah
[8:18] yeah and that's fine
[8:20] when we are a child we are like a child
[8:22] and we have to grow
[8:24] don't be impatient with those people
[8:25] don't be impatient with people that are
[8:27] less immature they have to go through
[8:29] through childhood training
[8:32] but once they mature
[8:34] god will lead them the same way like you
[8:36] you have to
[8:38] tolerate you know you that 40 50 years
[8:41] tolerate
[8:42] the one that just came in
[8:44] because sooner or later he went up like
[8:45] you i'm even better i know not better
[8:50] but the revelation is missing
[8:52] it's not real to the majority of god
[8:55] children's whoa
[8:58] see how important is revelation
[9:01] without a revelation you can have a
[9:02] vision
[9:04] god has to show you a vision
[9:06] this morning
[9:07] it is just a good verse in the bible
[9:09] that's all
[9:10] and that's what they have at the
[9:11] denomination
[9:13] they got good word
[9:15] but that's all
[9:17] but we need to have
[9:20] it made what
[9:21] alive quicken
[9:24] and that takes revelation
[9:28] so righteousness
[9:30] i am the righteousness of god
[9:33] in a broad
[9:34] sense it is the state of him
[9:38] who is
[9:40] as he act to be
[9:43] potentially i am
[9:46] in his eyes what i act to be
[9:49] see that's what i'm looking at
[9:51] i'm not looking at this guy that made me
[9:53] fall
[9:54] and looking what i ought to be
[9:58] because that is what i am this is not
[10:00] what i am
[10:02] the vision said that's what i am
[10:06] because is a condition acceptable and
[10:09] approved god approved me already in
[10:11] christ
[10:12] i don't need your acceptance
[10:15] i already been accepted
[10:17] you cannot put me in you're going to
[10:18] take me out
[10:20] because i already been accepted
[10:24] and this morning i don't need your
[10:25] approval on this preaching
[10:27] because you already accepted it
[10:30] so do you approve it or not it has
[10:31] nothing to do with anything
[10:35] but it's good that you will accept it
[10:37] too
[10:38] if you come from him
[10:41] now
[10:41] definition
[10:44] kind of
[10:45] simple definition i don't like to get
[10:47] bogged down because i know i cannot get
[10:49] out then
[10:50] i don't want to get myself too deep
[10:53] so i keep
[10:55] the act
[10:56] of power
[10:59] or of anticipating
[11:03] that which will or
[11:06] may come to be
[11:08] the righteousness of god that's what i
[11:11] want that's what i got that's what i
[11:13] want to be
[11:15] but
[11:18] a definition of a vision
[11:21] is the power
[11:23] to anticipate
[11:25] see some time
[11:27] i asked my children
[11:29] and even young people what did you want
[11:31] to be
[11:32] oh ain't got no idea i said you almost
[11:34] graduated
[11:36] do you have your mind made up you have a
[11:37] course you have traced that
[11:39] do you have a desire no so how can you
[11:42] become something
[11:44] that you don't know what it is that you
[11:45] want to become
[11:47] see no anticipation that don't mean
[11:49] they're going to stay there on these
[11:50] days
[11:52] you know something clicks
[11:54] ah
[11:55] now you have a vision
[11:57] i'm anticipating to be an engineer or
[12:00] whatever
[12:02] see anticipation
[12:04] of what you want to become
[12:07] and what you and i want to become is the
[12:09] righteousness
[12:10] of god
[12:12] brother branham
[12:14] define vision this way
[12:17] a vision is just
[12:19] many people ask me
[12:21] this is 56408 okay
[12:24] but the problem
[12:26] it is material that you look at
[12:29] it says or it is just impressing your
[12:31] mind
[12:32] something that you imagine he says no
[12:35] no
[12:36] is material
[12:39] wow
[12:41] it's just as real remember about
[12:43] revelations rio is just as real
[12:46] as i am looking right now to you
[12:49] so i can almost touch it probably it's
[12:52] so tangible that i almost can't just
[12:54] grab it
[12:56] it says
[12:58] now
[12:59] now
[13:00] how that happened is done by
[13:02] the sovereign grace of god
[13:05] he has nothing
[13:06] to do with it and you and i have nothing
[13:09] to do with that
[13:11] he says his friends about the the light
[13:14] the hand over the room
[13:16] and he's been like that
[13:18] all the time
[13:19] i want to show you guys vision here
[13:22] so you can understand a little bit more
[13:24] where i'm going with this
[13:26] masterpiece
[13:30] masterpiece
[13:32] the perfect image
[13:35] that god man god man that's the perfect
[13:38] image that god had in his mind
[13:41] and morphe
[13:43] and you know what a morphe is it's just
[13:45] a form
[13:47] it's an impression it's a copy
[13:49] see it's an appearance
[13:51] it looked like it
[13:54] you know i was looking at this
[13:56] and it made sense
[13:58] when god took on a form like with
[14:01] abraham
[14:02] he took on a form a human form
[14:05] but that human form he created it right
[14:07] there
[14:09] it wasn't born in the belly of a woman
[14:11] it wasn't you know it doesn't grow
[14:14] ate you know from the ground
[14:16] fed the cells
[14:18] and whatever was in the ground that
[14:19] becomes that
[14:21] no
[14:22] right away
[14:23] he is a human being melchizedek when he
[14:26] made abraham
[14:28] again you know
[14:31] that was just the form
[14:33] of what jesus christ was going to be
[14:35] later on
[14:36] however that wasn't the real thing
[14:40] it was a form
[14:41] because that body
[14:43] was still like this body
[14:45] that was
[14:46] made up there quickly perfect boom
[14:49] this body was done made that way
[14:52] so that was the difference that was a
[14:54] that was a an impression
[14:57] that was going to be
[14:59] later on
[15:01] now think about it because that's what a
[15:02] vision is
[15:04] he has changed from the supernatural
[15:09] so he got his
[15:10] supernatural and he went to the vision
[15:14] see
[15:16] and then the vision was projected
[15:19] that image
[15:21] that he had in his mind
[15:24] became a vision and then it was what
[15:28] projected
[15:29] and jesus christ was born
[15:32] same thing with you and i
[15:34] you were in his mind
[15:36] or the supernatural
[15:38] but you didn't stay there
[15:41] you became the vision then
[15:43] and then once you become the vision the
[15:45] revelation of what god one tended to be
[15:48] then
[15:49] you are manifested
[15:52] in that flesh
[15:53] but it was already seen
[15:55] before the foundation of the world
[15:58] your beginning
[15:59] you had any
[16:01] no beginning
[16:02] and he saw your end
[16:05] he saw the vision
[16:07] he saw everything
[16:09] see
[16:10] and that image was meeting
[16:12] that the supernatural
[16:14] god
[16:15] could taste of the feeling of death
[16:18] you cannot kill god
[16:20] god is a spirit so how can god taste of
[16:23] that
[16:24] taste it he says not that he was dead
[16:28] see but the body could die jesus body
[16:31] died
[16:32] and he tasted in that body
[16:34] of the death
[16:37] god then
[16:38] in the cross jesus said it is finished
[16:41] and he healed
[16:43] the spirit that was god
[16:45] but the body stayed in the cross
[16:48] you will see him again when he comes
[16:49] back
[16:50] you will not see that body
[16:52] nobody die
[16:55] this body is going to die
[16:57] this is not eli that you're going to see
[16:59] when the change of you know body will
[17:02] come
[17:03] i have a more perfect body than this one
[17:06] and my wife said hallelujah upper
[17:11] because i told her you know
[17:13] that i was
[17:16] perfect she don't believe me but one of
[17:19] these says she's going to believe me
[17:21] i will be perfect
[17:23] the way that god anticipated that us was
[17:26] going to be
[17:29] a morphe
[17:31] so the same thing
[17:32] with the churches i used the scriptures
[17:35] in
[17:35] in second titles three
[17:38] you know five
[17:39] having a form of godliness
[17:42] is a form
[17:44] they're trying to copy they're trying to
[17:46] look like but it's not real
[17:49] this is not real
[17:51] ah that body that i have over that
[17:53] that's why waiting for me is more real
[17:55] than this
[17:56] you see they're having a form of
[17:58] godliness
[17:59] but it's not real
[18:01] because they don't have the power to
[18:02] make that to project it to manifest it
[18:06] so
[18:10] in hebrew
[18:13] uh let's see
[18:15] let me give you another vision that's
[18:16] god let me give you jesus vision
[18:20] hebrew 12 too
[18:22] because i'm trying to show you if god
[18:24] had to have a vision
[18:26] and jesus had to have a vision
[18:28] you have to have one
[18:30] you cannot escape without one
[18:32] you're gonna go through through life
[18:35] through the literally look like in the
[18:36] tulips picnics it just won't work
[18:39] because you won't get
[18:40] nowhere you're wasting time
[18:43] listen
[18:45] looking unto jesus
[18:47] the author and finisher of our faith
[18:52] who for the joy
[18:54] that was said
[18:55] before him
[18:58] endure the cross
[19:01] for the joy that was the vision the
[19:03] bride
[19:04] for that vision of her
[19:07] he endured the cross
[19:09] when he was in the cross i was in his
[19:12] mind
[19:14] you you was in his mind
[19:18] that's why he endured the cross
[19:19] because he was in hessemania he says
[19:22] he was human father
[19:26] can
[19:27] can we have another way to do this
[19:29] can this cause
[19:30] cup will pass it's another way
[19:36] but that vision
[19:38] kept him on track
[19:41] he knew
[19:42] but he kept him in track
[19:44] to do
[19:45] what he needed to do because that was a
[19:47] revelation
[19:49] to him
[19:50] that was a vision that he could not go
[19:53] dva left
[19:55] or right
[19:57] but he tried
[20:00] he tried
[20:01] so he got had a vision
[20:04] and jesus had a vision
[20:07] so
[20:08] in matthew
[20:11] 26 39
[20:13] i just read you this one i quoted
[20:16] when jesus went to pray
[20:19] if it's possible let this cup cup pass
[20:22] from me nevertheless
[20:24] not me but you will see that's what a
[20:26] vision will keep you
[20:28] will keep you to make the right choices
[20:32] without a vision you just make you got
[20:33] one choice
[20:34] whatever the devil wants to pull you
[20:36] through
[20:37] but when you have a vision you keep you
[20:39] on track your life keeps going moving
[20:42] forward the devil will try to deviate
[20:44] you from left to right but that vision
[20:47] of who you are
[20:48] what you are
[20:50] you make a decision based on that
[20:53] so you have to have a vision
[20:55] because no other way you can decide
[20:58] what's left or what right unless you
[21:00] know what's
[21:01] straight ahead
[21:04] so you stay
[21:05] you stay in that journey
[21:07] moving forward
[21:09] it says
[21:15] you know jesus could have a wife
[21:18] it was rightful he has right to have a
[21:21] family children's
[21:23] to have a job to have a car everything
[21:25] that you have he had a right to
[21:27] but he said i will sanctify myself for
[21:29] her
[21:31] and we're not going to sanctify
[21:32] ourselves for for him
[21:38] sanctify you mean
[21:40] you just leave
[21:41] the world alone don't conform to the
[21:44] world
[21:45] but be transformed
[21:48] to that image
[21:51] i'm kind of going ahead of me but
[21:53] enoch
[21:55] he walked
[21:56] and he hey brother
[21:58] brother paul i'm glad that he didn't run
[22:00] i cannot run any longer
[22:02] i lost my breath
[22:04] but the bible said he walked
[22:06] so don't do not to run
[22:10] okay you can relax
[22:13] and take it easy in this journey
[22:16] you know you know step out of time
[22:17] brother i remember faster than you and i
[22:19] passed you don't worry about it
[22:22] because the first kid there is not the
[22:24] winner
[22:26] it's just your mentality
[22:28] you're not competing against anybody
[22:30] that's the problem with with christians
[22:32] we compare ourselves with everybody
[22:35] you don't need to you compare yourself
[22:37] with god word
[22:39] forget where that guy is at
[22:41] he has to do the same you do
[22:44] so you don't compress you know you keep
[22:46] walking
[22:47] you know and satan throw you in the left
[22:49] and throw you in the right and pick you
[22:51] in the front on the back and everywhere
[22:53] and you just ignore and you just keep
[22:54] walking
[22:57] you keep walking towards that vision
[23:00] you can walk into a division and you
[23:02] know walk
[23:04] walk
[23:04] until he took his last step and he
[23:07] became
[23:08] the vision
[23:12] that must have been tremendous can you
[23:13] imagine
[23:14] i cannot even imagine it
[23:17] going from time one more step
[23:20] and then suddenly
[23:23] something changed
[23:28] one of these days as we continue walking
[23:31] you want to walk towards the vision
[23:35] because you need to become
[23:37] the vision you need to step up
[23:39] on that vision
[23:41] so it's important that you have what
[23:47] you
[23:48] know i keep thinking about that day
[23:52] i cannot even imagine we can't i mean
[23:54] this is too limited you know we are
[23:56] finite people
[23:57] we're trying to figure out infinite
[23:59] things that we don't even know but
[24:01] but we do our best with what we have
[24:04] so i was thinking
[24:06] one of these days
[24:08] the wife and i are going to take a straw
[24:11] you know
[24:12] and suddenly jump
[24:16] and i'm gonna look at her
[24:18] and i'm gonna say oh my goodness
[24:21] where were you being all these years
[24:23] [Laughter]
[24:25] i was looking for you
[24:28] when were you hitting ah
[24:31] and she's going to look at me and say
[24:32] well
[24:33] husband so we are
[24:36] you look better than
[24:38] than before that i met you
[24:41] and then we're going to look in the
[24:42] mirror and say wow
[24:44] my
[24:46] see that's what's gonna happen that's
[24:48] what i'm looking towards i'm looking to
[24:50] step into that vision
[24:54] i die before i get there doesn't matter
[24:58] if i die listen this you need to listen
[25:00] to this
[25:01] paul or his group died
[25:04] at throughout the seven churches
[25:05] everybody died but when they went down
[25:08] in the ground
[25:09] they went down with an
[25:13] that's anticipation
[25:14] paul says not that i already apprehended
[25:16] not that already there damn that already
[25:18] perfect but i'm moving towards the goal
[25:22] so i moved toward the goal
[25:24] and if i die if i fall there
[25:27] i die without anticipation
[25:29] so when the lord comes and quick me
[25:32] yes there's no you know upgrading or
[25:35] there's not trying to remember what
[25:37] where i was before that and after that i
[25:40] already know it's just
[25:42] my anticipation
[25:44] and all those that they died 2000 years
[25:46] ago
[25:47] they died with an anticipation
[25:49] and when they come back it's still going
[25:51] to be there
[25:52] they just can't move
[25:54] they're just going to become that
[25:55] anticipation
[25:57] but you have to
[25:58] you know if we go the way of the grave
[26:01] we have to have a vision
[26:04] and death
[26:05] death
[26:06] cannot even separate me
[26:09] from the love of god
[26:11] there's nothing not even a weapon can be
[26:14] created to destroy me and separate me
[26:16] from the my anticipation
[26:19] there's no weapon form
[26:21] satan
[26:23] you lost god you win
[26:26] you know
[26:29] satan is is a
[26:31] good enemy i mean
[26:34] i mean but
[26:35] next time he comes around you you tell
[26:37] them hey
[26:38] satan you know what
[26:41] i heard
[26:42] that everything that was created
[26:44] has to die
[26:46] wink wink
[26:50] so far as i know your time
[26:53] is near
[26:55] but wait wait satan how hold on this is
[26:57] islaming for you satan
[27:00] i was not created
[27:03] i was in the mind of god
[27:05] before the foundation of the world so if
[27:08] i got eternal life i was in god i cannot
[27:11] die more than god can die
[27:19] so you tell satan satan
[27:21] i'll tell you something i'm gonna give
[27:23] you a
[27:24] a little
[27:26] thing in what's gonna happen in the
[27:27] future
[27:28] i said i will be
[27:31] in the kicking team that is to kick you
[27:33] in that hole
[27:34] in that day
[27:36] when your days are numbered and i'm
[27:38] going to be there
[27:40] part of that
[27:43] he won't like that
[27:45] but that's right
[27:47] he created too many problems i need to
[27:49] create some from him now
[27:52] so
[27:53] you know you're the master
[27:55] of your choices
[27:58] we're gonna go to that in a minute
[28:01] not satan you're the master of your
[28:03] choices
[28:04] you know you want to be happy
[28:06] this morning
[28:07] it's your choice
[28:09] i cannot make you happy
[28:12] i cannot do anything for you
[28:15] it is your choice you want to be sad
[28:18] your choice you want to be happy your
[28:20] choice
[28:22] you want to be healed your choice
[28:25] i can pray for you all i want but it's
[28:27] your choice do you want the healing
[28:30] you have choices
[28:32] he has not taken away the choices
[28:35] but i'm glad that because we got him we
[28:37] can make the right choices
[28:39] when the time comes
[28:42] okay you don't have to pay for that that
[28:43] was free
[28:46] for the earnest expectation let's go
[28:48] about
[28:49] my vision
[28:51] we saw god we saw jesus now your vision
[28:54] for the earnest expectation of the
[28:56] creature
[28:57] waited
[28:58] waited
[29:00] for the manifestation of the sons of god
[29:02] it's getting a little warm here
[29:04] i'm glad i took the other one off there
[29:07] you you wore me
[29:10] but i'm not sweating
[29:12] i'm not sweaty
[29:14] so
[29:15] first corinthians 13 11 says
[29:18] when i was a child i speak like a child
[29:21] i understood as a child
[29:23] thought
[29:24] as a child but when i became a man
[29:26] i put away
[29:28] child distance
[29:30] you know that's the worst
[29:32] the worst you can see a 40 year old baby
[29:35] crying in church
[29:38] i mean that's kind of too far right
[29:41] when you're a man you grow
[29:43] and you leave all that stuff
[29:45] this is what brother brown says ladies
[29:47] and gents
[29:49] he is the true witness now
[29:51] this word true
[29:53] is the same word as we saw back there
[29:56] in revelation 3 7. you recall that it
[30:00] does not mean true as in a constant
[30:03] as in contrast with false
[30:06] it has a richer deeper
[30:08] by far meaning
[30:11] like that it says
[30:13] it says
[30:16] eat express
[30:18] perfect
[30:20] realization
[30:22] in contrast with partial
[30:25] realization
[30:27] we are living in a partial
[30:29] realization
[30:33] you only can see what it's going to be
[30:35] but it's not here yet i'm not having
[30:37] change
[30:38] i'm still moving towards my change
[30:42] see
[30:43] so what you're seeing is just partial
[30:46] but it would come the day
[30:48] that will express the perfect
[30:51] that what you see impartially right now
[30:54] it will become that
[30:57] see
[30:58] it says partial realization
[31:01] it says
[31:03] hallelujah we have been looking through
[31:04] a glass darkly you know
[31:07] he said but soon it will be
[31:10] face
[31:11] to face i will be known
[31:13] as he knew me
[31:15] right now it's kind of
[31:17] well i see i see you look like you must
[31:20] be you you talk you smell like you it
[31:23] must be you rely yes but there's
[31:25] something that is me
[31:27] that is going to be the realization
[31:29] of that word
[31:31] you don't see it yet
[31:33] i'm not there yet
[31:34] but just wait a little longer
[31:37] and this
[31:38] will be they realize
[31:40] what god had in his mind this is he says
[31:43] we have been looking through the glass
[31:44] diary but soon as you will be face to
[31:46] face we have been going from glory to
[31:48] glory
[31:50] you come to church
[31:51] because you need to grow
[31:53] from glory to glory what is the glory of
[31:56] god is character
[31:58] what are you doing that's growing in the
[32:00] character
[32:01] you know his character
[32:03] but if you don't come to church what
[32:05] happened
[32:06] well at least listen at the tape
[32:08] you know it won't be the same effect
[32:10] being in here
[32:12] like coming to church sorry
[32:15] you cannot
[32:16] duplicate
[32:18] the spirit of god in the machine that's
[32:20] right
[32:23] but you can listen another word at least
[32:26] i got my
[32:27] my meta make it real to you by
[32:29] revealing it to you
[32:31] perfect realization complete realization
[32:35] we have we have been looking through a
[32:37] glass darkly
[32:38] but soon it will be face to face and
[32:41] those times are here
[32:43] this is not the end time this is the end
[32:45] of the end time we are that close
[32:48] and the closer we get to the vision
[32:51] the closer you're going to see him
[32:53] face to face
[32:55] you're going to get a glimpse
[32:57] you know of him
[32:59] as you walk
[33:00] and the more you walk and the closer you
[33:02] walk
[33:03] you're going to start seeing him clear
[33:05] and the more clear you see his word at
[33:07] him the more clear you see yourself
[33:11] in him
[33:13] he says
[33:14] faith we have been going from glory to
[33:16] glory but soon you will write glory in
[33:19] the right glory
[33:20] like king not glory to glory to glory to
[33:23] glory until glory god we going out of
[33:26] here
[33:28] my brother asked me
[33:30] yesterday i think it was he says
[33:32] how are you feeling
[33:34] ah so far so good
[33:37] and
[33:38] he says well let me tell you
[33:40] a joke about that
[33:42] okay
[33:43] this guy
[33:44] went up in the building hi
[33:47] and he jumped
[33:48] and he was going down somebody yelled at
[33:50] him
[33:51] how's it going what's so far so good
[33:56] i said well
[33:58] thank you brother that's your
[33:59] interpretation
[34:02] mine is
[34:03] so far so good but i'm not going down
[34:06] and going up
[34:07] [Applause]
[34:10] and not hitting the ground
[34:12] heavenly places
[34:14] so so far so good but see there's more
[34:17] to come the better year has to come this
[34:20] is so far so good departure realization
[34:23] but one of these days
[34:24] hey i'm gonna get there
[34:27] and i'll be complete
[34:30] hallelujah
[34:31] [Applause]
[34:33] so don't lose your hope
[34:35] don't lose your enthusiasm
[34:37] for the coming of the lord
[34:40] again
[34:42] it says we have been going from glory to
[34:44] glory but soon it will run right into
[34:46] the glory see you become the vision you
[34:50] walk right into the vision
[34:52] you have to keep it always
[34:54] in front of you because that's what you
[34:56] want to become
[34:57] and then you can deal with the life the
[34:59] left and the right and all the things
[35:01] that come to you that are trying to pull
[35:03] you out no
[35:04] i know where i'm going
[35:06] and i'm gonna stay with the gates of god
[35:09] this is where i'm going
[35:11] i don't care if they were fall
[35:13] that's my goal
[35:16] it says i don't care nobody want to come
[35:18] with me
[35:19] that's my goal
[35:21] i don't believe sometimes
[35:24] and i'm not saying this i'm not
[35:25] criticizing not judging anybody
[35:29] but some people after 30 years in this
[35:31] message
[35:32] do you think they had a vision
[35:35] i think they had a television but not a
[35:37] vision
[35:42] because if they had a vision you would
[35:44] never fall
[35:45] jesus didn't fall
[35:48] he was concentrated focused on the
[35:50] vision
[35:51] so i don't think they never had a vision
[35:52] they had an agenda
[35:54] but they never had a vision
[35:57] we had couples in our church
[35:59] not not
[36:01] past years but
[36:02] you know a few years back
[36:05] they come to church families
[36:07] they sit there with us for years and
[36:09] years suddenly they disappear
[36:12] and i wonder what happened then later on
[36:14] i hear
[36:15] she divorced him
[36:17] kids are in the street
[36:20] and i said
[36:22] something is wrong
[36:23] that's not god
[36:25] god cannot light me
[36:27] he cannot like he says you know i will
[36:30] finish the work that i started
[36:34] that's what and i'm you know holding to
[36:36] that
[36:38] i committed on to him because i know
[36:40] that he started the work he will finish
[36:41] it
[36:43] so what happened
[36:45] well keep saying there was no vision
[36:47] and it was no revelation
[36:49] however they sat down there for so many
[36:51] years
[36:52] but it was words verses
[36:56] it was bible it was never
[36:58] a revelation
[37:03] says
[37:04] it says from greater glory
[37:07] right into the glory and his glory
[37:10] capital
[37:12] and his glory
[37:14] will shine
[37:16] now i want you to i want to stop him you
[37:18] know
[37:21] there's no way you're getting closer to
[37:23] him
[37:24] every day in this journey
[37:26] and you're growing towards that
[37:29] and you won't shine it
[37:32] the
[37:33] the
[37:35] you know
[37:36] the way i can tell
[37:38] that you are getting closer is the way
[37:40] you act
[37:42] because the closer you get
[37:44] you should be sweet tough
[37:48] sweeter than the day before said the sun
[37:51] so the closer you get to that you must
[37:53] shine
[37:56] and people will look at you saying i
[37:57] don't understand
[37:58] chaos two years called me died
[38:03] but you're not worried about it
[38:06] see the darkness is pressing in mondays
[38:08] and darkness but you and i we shine
[38:12] because the darkness cannot put
[38:14] the light out
[38:16] we can put the darkness but not the
[38:18] light
[38:20] so the closest you get there
[38:22] he must shine
[38:24] a burst that is a asaya 360
[38:28] uh arise
[38:30] and shine
[38:32] yeah that your light
[38:34] has come
[38:36] the closer you get
[38:38] the more light
[38:40] you cannot be the same
[38:41] if you're telling me you are getting
[38:43] closer
[38:44] and closer closer
[38:48] something got to change
[38:51] if you're getting closer to that
[38:52] something
[38:53] must change
[38:55] because god do not lie
[38:58] it's wonderful
[39:00] my wife said get closer get closer you
[39:02] need to change
[39:04] you know
[39:05] sometimes i i'm sorry sometimes
[39:08] i just lose it sometimes
[39:10] you know
[39:12] and uh sometimes you push the wrong
[39:14] buttons and i and i come out
[39:17] and i had to apologize
[39:19] i'm not there yet
[39:21] i'm just partially but i'm i'm gonna get
[39:22] there
[39:24] because it's
[39:25] god is gonna have you push the button
[39:27] until this button don't work anymore
[39:34] you know
[39:35] when the tempo was built
[39:38] it was no noise
[39:40] it was the tools once the rock was cut
[39:43] out there somewhere and brought to the
[39:45] temple they put them together and you
[39:47] know how they feed them
[39:52] until there was no
[39:54] gap
[39:56] perfectly
[39:58] and that's what's happening in church
[40:00] [Applause]
[40:01] see paul paul and me we come together
[40:04] and we talk
[40:05] and you come to church and the word
[40:07] and your wife or your husband your
[40:09] brother tell you something that you
[40:12] didn't like
[40:14] and you had to either by your tone or
[40:15] say something
[40:17] but that is
[40:18] listen if you have never been
[40:20] disappointed you will
[40:23] as long as you display in this flesh
[40:24] you're going to say you're sorry but
[40:26] that is part of the
[40:29] and it's not the outside people that are
[40:31] going to do that
[40:33] it's in the temple
[40:36] see i'm going to rob myself and get my
[40:38] brother my brain against me
[40:40] until we can feed
[40:42] because we're not living here until we
[40:43] can feed
[40:45] god did not create a temple that is
[40:47] crooked with cracks and water go through
[40:50] and we don't know
[40:52] it is sealed completely
[40:55] and this body is going to be tight
[40:58] it will be so tight that satan cannot
[41:00] even
[41:01] enter in
[41:03] we want to come to the point says now
[41:06] everything looks good and you got a
[41:07] worshipping and everything
[41:09] fine but it's going to come today
[41:11] that satan will infiltrate
[41:14] you know he would send somebody he had
[41:16] to use a body
[41:18] he says when he do that
[41:20] the closest you can get to each other
[41:23] that's what you want to do
[41:25] because you don't want satan in between
[41:27] you and your brother
[41:29] so when satan comes with some gossip
[41:31] i don't care who we're going to use to
[41:33] gossip
[41:35] and i don't have nobody in mind
[41:37] but if the shoe feed just squirt it
[41:43] god said
[41:45] 17
[41:46] 16 i hate but the last one
[41:49] is an abomination
[41:50] those that so what
[41:53] discord
[41:55] not in church
[41:56] if somebody trying to fill your ear with
[41:58] trash
[41:59] tell them this is not a trash trashcan
[42:01] [Applause]
[42:02] [Music]
[42:04] because i know what's going to happen if
[42:06] i hear that stuff
[42:07] you know i had a brother one time i love
[42:09] that brother
[42:11] he said to me
[42:12] i gotta tell you something about swalson
[42:15] some brother at church i was new in the
[42:17] message anyway
[42:19] so he figured you know i would not know
[42:21] the difference
[42:22] but anyway he says
[42:25] i want to tell you what happened to that
[42:26] brother and i said
[42:28] ho ho stop let me ask you a question
[42:33] if that's going to affect the way i'm
[42:35] looking at him now
[42:37] probably okay i don't want to know
[42:40] you know why
[42:41] because when you hear god said you like
[42:44] it or not it's going to affect the way
[42:45] you look at that sister and that brother
[42:48] because when you look at her now you're
[42:50] thinking about what you were saw
[42:52] so don't accept any trash
[42:54] because that is the devil
[42:57] don't lend your ears
[43:00] to trash
[43:02] stay
[43:03] just honing each other when you come to
[43:06] surrey home home home
[43:09] and let all that impurity
[43:12] out
[43:14] well again free i don't know who needed
[43:17] that
[43:18] but that we are we are complete with him
[43:21] the truth he would not lie to us about
[43:24] that see but one day will be be changed
[43:29] are we in the same place
[43:36] i don't know we
[43:41] uh
[43:41] that's good enough
[43:45] he says it is wonderful we are
[43:46] completing him that is true he will not
[43:49] lie to us that's what i was talking
[43:50] about he says we will put immortality it
[43:53] will be a change one of these days we
[43:55] will be
[43:56] all swallow swallow up
[43:59] in life
[44:01] it says then
[44:03] we will realize
[44:06] realization whenever you realize now who
[44:09] you are and what you are one of these
[44:11] days you will realization of that
[44:13] but you have to keep it fresh in your
[44:15] mind that's why you come to church you
[44:17] want to keep it afresh this is what god
[44:19] said this is who i am this is what i was
[44:22] supposed to do
[44:24] you have to be afraid every day
[44:26] because satan will
[44:28] will try to steal it from you
[44:32] put immortality proverbs
[44:34] 29 18. i want to give you another
[44:36] version
[44:37] then the living
[44:39] translation he says
[44:42] when people do not accept divine
[44:44] guidance
[44:47] they run wow
[44:50] that's bad to come to church and don't
[44:51] listen to the word coming out of the
[44:53] pulpit
[44:54] you go out there and you wrong wow
[44:57] but whosoevers obey the law it's joyful
[45:03] let me make a
[45:05] quick statement here
[45:08] there are some people that will not to
[45:09] come to church they believe not coming
[45:11] to church
[45:12] and those people who are
[45:14] the pandemic have made it real nice
[45:18] now they have excuse not to come to
[45:20] church
[45:22] before the pandemic
[45:24] they had excuses
[45:26] well not excuses they had reasons why
[45:30] but now with the pandemic
[45:32] oh brother i think i have a little
[45:34] nose running i'm gonna stay home
[45:37] the reason is you need welcome to i mean
[45:39] if you sick stay home no that's not what
[45:41] i'm saying
[45:42] but there's some people that are using
[45:44] excuses the pandemic
[45:46] and we knew that two years ago when it
[45:48] started and then the preachers had to be
[45:51] streaming they didn't want to bro the
[45:53] dog didn't want to my pastor because he
[45:55] knew what was going to happen he already
[45:57] saw it he said now people get adjusted
[45:59] they sit in there with their pajamas and
[46:01] popcorn and watch them
[46:02] oh come on don't tell me that you don't
[46:04] do that
[46:07] don't come on
[46:12] you don't put your best clothes
[46:13] three-piece suit and sit down in your
[46:14] living room
[46:20] okay we're here anyway
[46:22] so
[46:25] you know you cannot recreate
[46:27] what happened in here
[46:29] a while ago the the presence of god fell
[46:32] and people scream
[46:34] and people yell and the atmosphere
[46:36] change you cannot do in the living room
[46:39] you know why
[46:41] this is god program
[46:44] that wasn't brother paul decided but
[46:46] this is what we're going to have church
[46:47] instead is that we're going to do this
[46:48] no
[46:50] church is god program
[46:53] it's not us
[46:55] now because every church is autonomous
[46:58] we don't have cookie cutters everybody
[46:59] got to do the same thing
[47:01] you know we have certain variations
[47:04] but this is god's program
[47:06] to shape you to form you
[47:09] to his image
[47:10] by taking the word
[47:12] and
[47:13] you know taking all that out that is
[47:15] undisturbed that god don't like on your
[47:17] life
[47:18] you know like a masterpiece cheap chip
[47:21] chip and when we preach the gospel you
[47:23] know
[47:25] start shaping
[47:27] you don't get that at home
[47:29] because at home something is missing
[47:32] it's not the same thing
[47:34] okay
[47:36] i can chase
[47:38] only one thousand at home watching on my
[47:41] streaming
[47:42] how many people we have here
[47:45] thousands
[47:46] so not that was gonna come to that door
[47:49] because there's more walls
[47:50] than you have in the living room
[47:52] so there's more power here to chase
[47:55] these demons and the sprays away so god
[47:58] can do a work on you
[48:02] well that's my take off anyway
[48:04] it says having a form of godliness but
[48:07] denying the power thereof
[48:10] a person
[48:12] with no vision is blind
[48:14] period
[48:17] jesus says let the blind lead the blind
[48:22] in this message pastors know the
[48:23] denomination they have no vision
[48:26] it's a blind lead in the blind and you
[48:27] know what's going to happen
[48:29] they fall in the hole
[48:31] because that's all the target they have
[48:33] no target
[48:35] so a person that is blind
[48:37] you know at the end of the street i see
[48:39] him gonna assist it they got a little
[48:41] you know
[48:42] so they walk by feelings
[48:45] we don't walk by feeling we walk by
[48:47] but they go by feeling you know i feel i
[48:49] feel i feel get out of the way i feel
[48:51] afraid
[48:53] you're in my way
[48:55] and when you do that
[48:58] you are prone to
[48:59] to me perhaps you know because you don't
[49:02] know what is idea you're blind
[49:04] you don't see the obstacles
[49:07] you cannot prepare
[49:09] prepare for what you cannot even know
[49:11] what to prepare for because you don't
[49:13] see it
[49:14] at war you have to know what your enemy
[49:16] what you see what he do how he dress how
[49:18] he fight
[49:19] in football the same thing they look at
[49:21] the tape they look at the tape they look
[49:22] at the taste
[49:24] so they can prepare you cannot prepare
[49:26] if you don't know
[49:27] what you're getting
[49:28] into you can do the best but you're
[49:31] going to fail
[49:33] because you don't know what's coming at
[49:35] you
[49:36] see
[49:37] so
[49:38] they cannot anticipate
[49:41] so you cannot prepare
[49:43] see
[49:46] you cannot focus
[49:48] on anything
[49:49] you're blind
[49:50] you can focus
[49:52] so
[49:54] a vision a lack of a lack of vision or
[49:57] purpose
[49:58] see
[49:59] results
[50:00] in people that are not prepared
[50:02] unprepared
[50:03] and we still got people in churches
[50:05] sitting for years
[50:07] and they're not prepared
[50:09] because they have no vision
[50:13] they have an agenda but they got no
[50:14] vision
[50:16] because
[50:18] if we all have the same vision that is
[50:19] the same vision for you and me
[50:22] for this body it's the same vision
[50:25] so if it's the same vision it should be
[50:26] not division
[50:28] right
[50:30] if it's the same vision we come to the
[50:32] vision and we unite together
[50:34] on that vision
[50:36] and if you're not uniting
[50:38] on that vision
[50:40] you are
[50:42] disuniting
[50:44] amen
[50:46] so it is important
[50:47] because a vision
[50:49] if you don't have a vision people
[50:51] tend to drift away
[50:53] that's why we have people in church one
[50:55] year and then they go on the next
[50:58] i'm not talking about those that lived
[51:00] because work and had to move no not
[51:02] talking about that
[51:04] see
[51:05] drifting alone
[51:07] in the christian journey and then you
[51:08] wonder what what happened to swansea
[51:11] what
[51:13] you know what i call them hitchhikers
[51:17] yeah they go from church to jersey
[51:19] psyche
[51:21] he's shocked that's why brother brown
[51:22] calls him i got a quote
[51:24] the hitchhike no i got a quote for you
[51:26] if you want to hitchhiking from church
[51:28] to church
[51:29] because they don't know what they want
[51:31] they don't even know what they look what
[51:32] they want so they go from church to
[51:34] church maybe that pastor maybe that
[51:36] pastor maybe that pastor no
[51:38] it's not the pastor it's not the church
[51:40] it is you
[51:43] because you left here with a problem and
[51:45] when you get there the problem goes when
[51:47] we do you
[51:48] and maybe when you got there everything
[51:50] was perfect no no more when you get
[51:52] there
[51:55] because you're going to start all over
[51:56] again the posture is greener in the
[51:58] other side
[51:59] no it's not
[52:01] i tried that don't work i need to move
[52:04] on
[52:05] philippians 3 1
[52:09] not as i i had already attained it
[52:12] either were already perfect
[52:15] but i follow after i follow after
[52:19] ambition it says if that i may apprehend
[52:22] it that which also i am apprehended in
[52:27] christ see it's not you
[52:29] it's not you that what took hold of you
[52:34] jesus christ that was two whole of your
[52:36] heart
[52:37] is the same one that you're trying to
[52:39] get hold to
[52:41] you get hold to that don't let it go you
[52:43] don't have to he won't let you go
[52:45] but it's not you trying
[52:47] it is him pulling you through you just
[52:50] had to eat yourself
[52:52] you had to commit
[52:53] you had to discipline yourself
[52:56] it says i'm jumping ahead again
[52:59] it says
[53:02] philippians 3 13 he says
[53:04] brother and sister i do not consider
[53:06] myself yet
[53:08] to have taken hold of it yet
[53:10] maybe don't look what i ought to be
[53:12] right now but watch your brother it
[53:14] might not look like i would have to be
[53:17] but one of these days it will
[53:19] he says i will surprise a lot of people
[53:21] one of these days
[53:23] rayman says
[53:24] you're going to be surprised that day
[53:26] who made it and who didn't
[53:29] because sometimes we like to judge by
[53:31] by seeing the cover of the book
[53:34] but you don't know who
[53:35] it's going to who's not
[53:37] you need to worry about yourself
[53:39] and let everyone let your light shine so
[53:42] somebody can follow
[53:44] he said brother and sister says
[53:46] i don't consider myself yet
[53:48] there yet
[53:49] but i'm on my way
[53:51] philippians 3 14 i press store
[53:54] that's what we need to do press store
[53:56] every day just press toward the mark
[53:58] it says the goal
[54:00] to win the prize for which god has
[54:02] called me
[54:04] in heaven word you see
[54:07] and going how it goes so far so far so
[54:09] good
[54:11] so far seemed so good
[54:13] so far so good
[54:15] i pursue
[54:17] i pursue that
[54:18] you know that's an aggressive we're
[54:20] pursuing
[54:21] you know
[54:23] my wife
[54:25] she pursued me
[54:28] until she got what she wanted
[54:34] i'll tell you the testimony one of these
[54:40] i'm gonna pay for this
[54:44] let me conclude now that i'm ahead let
[54:46] me conclude
[54:49] a vision
[54:50] it's a powerful anticipation yeah you
[54:52] know what i'm talking about kenny
[54:54] a vision
[54:56] so i won't be by myself in this this
[54:58] thing a vision is a powerful
[55:01] anticipation so if i'm out you out we
[55:03] all got together at least
[55:06] okay better stop
[55:10] a vision is a powerful anticipation of
[55:12] who
[55:13] you are to be
[55:15] a vision creates
[55:17] consistent
[55:18] discipline you know why we don't have
[55:20] people discipline in church and they
[55:22] come and they don't come and they go and
[55:23] they don't go
[55:25] no vision
[55:26] no vision no discipline
[55:29] that's right
[55:30] and you wonder why someone come one day
[55:32] don't come the other day no i understand
[55:34] that some people live too far
[55:36] i understand that i'm not getting on
[55:37] that but if you're in town
[55:40] and you're healthy
[55:41] come and praise the lord for because you
[55:43] don't even
[55:44] why would you stay home
[55:46] that's what i'm talking about you're
[55:47] sick you're sick i'm not talking about
[55:49] that so
[55:50] a vision creates consistent discipline
[55:52] and consistent discipline will lead to
[55:55] desire
[55:56] you know what people are not discharged
[55:58] to come to church
[55:59] because they are not
[56:00] disciplined god is not going to give you
[56:02] this heart if he knows that you're not
[56:04] going to do it
[56:05] if you don't discipline yourself to come
[56:07] and come in good when it's bad when it's
[56:11] ugly
[56:12] god will not give you an option
[56:14] when you come to church god will give
[56:16] you a desire
[56:18] to come to church and when you're in
[56:19] church they give you an auction
[56:22] but it depends on the choice
[56:24] that you make
[56:26] because when i was time why you want me
[56:28] to give you this hour when you don't
[56:30] want to go
[56:32] show me first that you want to go
[56:34] and that's how god works
[56:37] you want the holy spirit
[56:39] you have to desire the holy spirit how
[56:41] much
[56:42] more than than your own life
[56:44] because when you do that he will give it
[56:46] to you
[56:48] but
[56:49] how much do you care
[56:50] he cares but how much do we care
[56:54] he says discipline that lead to desire
[56:57] and desire becomes a devotion
[57:01] see once you hear once you decided
[57:04] when you make your mind i have decided
[57:06] to follow jesus snow storm
[57:10] call
[57:12] that's not gonna even stop me to be here
[57:13] this morning
[57:15] because this is the place i'd rather be
[57:18] see i think i was called like esther
[57:22] this is my time
[57:25] god call you this is the end time it's
[57:27] your time you know that god is going to
[57:29] do something that he had never done
[57:30] before
[57:32] and you are the one that are going to
[57:34] show that
[57:36] you're going to be raptured
[57:38] you're going to be changed in a twinkle
[57:41] you know that has not been done yet
[57:43] that is new and you are the generation
[57:46] that had to do that
[57:48] and those seven six edges are waiting on
[57:51] you
[57:52] see because they are not complete
[57:55] without you
[57:56] so they're counting on you
[57:58] that you will change so they can come
[57:59] back
[58:01] if you don't change they ain't not
[58:02] coming back
[58:04] but we are not going to disappoint them
[58:05] god is not going to disappoint them he's
[58:08] going to finish our work
[58:10] when you try to discipline yourself
[58:12] you train
[58:15] and you're trying to act according to
[58:17] your goal to your vision
[58:19] if i was going to go to olympics to do
[58:21] whatever run or run
[58:23] i will that's my vision to win the
[58:25] olympic by running this race so i will
[58:29] discipline myself do everything that i
[58:31] need to
[58:33] so i can
[58:34] fulfill my vision
[58:38] see
[58:38] so you discipline yourself you train
[58:40] yourself don't indulge in a lot of
[58:42] sweets if you're running
[58:44] carbons okay if you're going to burn
[58:46] them fine you need a lot of carbs
[58:49] but you stay away
[58:51] from the things that are not good to you
[58:54] when you're training
[58:56] you discipline yourself
[58:58] you sleep
[58:59] you rest
[59:01] you work
[59:02] you have a good attitude
[59:06] because you if you have an attitude
[59:08] like you're not going to win then why
[59:10] run
[59:12] paul says not everybody's going to win
[59:15] but you need to run a race like you're
[59:17] gonna win
[59:18] that's a mental attitude
[59:20] because i'll tell you what 80 20
[59:23] of a race is physical or 50
[59:26] but mentally it's the other 50 percent
[59:28] you can be
[59:29] tip top shape
[59:32] but your mind can make you fall
[59:35] you need a mind that is ready and
[59:37] prepared
[59:39] as well as your body
[59:41] now this is what the bible said
[59:45] it says
[59:46] work
[59:49] how he says work
[59:51] do not
[59:53] i got to remember that scripture
[59:58] later
[1:00:01] i had a senior moment later
[1:00:05] i can claim that
[1:00:08] oh work
[1:00:10] prophet
[1:00:11] leader
[1:00:12] thank you somebody was thinking about so
[1:00:14] i picked her up
[1:00:16] no you laugh but it's true
[1:00:18] proximity something about proximity
[1:00:20] you know that i can sit down in my car
[1:00:22] my wife in the other side
[1:00:24] and i'm driving and i'm thinking i want
[1:00:25] a juicy hamburger when i get to phoenix
[1:00:28] before we take the airplane or whatever
[1:00:31] and i'm thinking so hard
[1:00:32] and she says do you want to stop in
[1:00:34] babylon get a hamburger
[1:00:36] but that wasn't her
[1:00:38] proximity
[1:00:39] you know when you get next to each other
[1:00:42] you can kind of
[1:00:43] oh i didn't know you were thinking that
[1:00:46] you pick up this is you know a thought
[1:00:48] is a spirit
[1:00:50] because the bible said
[1:00:51] the word is spirit so when you get a
[1:00:54] spirit on you
[1:00:55] come on listen
[1:00:57] this is not this is not
[1:00:59] rocket science
[1:01:01] when somebody has a bad spirit you
[1:01:02] detect it right away
[1:01:04] when somebody is mean
[1:01:06] and somebody's jealous or somebody just
[1:01:09] completely
[1:01:10] wants to harm you you feel it right away
[1:01:12] in fact don't take too long
[1:01:15] she's against me i don't i don't even
[1:01:17] near her
[1:01:18] she has a bad spirit but what about a
[1:01:21] good spirit
[1:01:23] don't tell me you can send satan's
[1:01:25] spirit and you cannot send god's spirit
[1:01:28] when you get next to a nice garlic
[1:01:30] brother or sister
[1:01:33] okay
[1:01:34] i was there so anyway
[1:01:37] so discipline
[1:01:38] run the race
[1:01:40] you know
[1:01:41] with a mental attitude
[1:01:43] that you're gonna get there
[1:01:45] regardless i'm not worrying about who's
[1:01:47] in my side who behind me who's in front
[1:01:50] of me my focus is on the goal
[1:01:54] he says hebrew 12 1
[1:01:57] therefore seeing we also are going to
[1:02:01] pass without about
[1:02:02] we saw great clout or witnesses let us
[1:02:05] lay aside every way listen this is the
[1:02:08] time
[1:02:08] we cannot be bogged down tied down we
[1:02:10] need to let go we need to tell it go and
[1:02:12] we need to let god
[1:02:14] it's not time to get
[1:02:16] conforming to the world or get tied up
[1:02:18] with anything you know we need to
[1:02:21] let go
[1:02:23] and let's move towards god
[1:02:25] if something is bothering you
[1:02:28] it doesn't matter take that weight
[1:02:30] caster paul says
[1:02:32] leave everything behind and move forward
[1:02:35] make your things right with god and move
[1:02:37] forward don't let that stop you to reach
[1:02:39] your goal
[1:02:41] laid aside sin which does so easily
[1:02:44] beset us
[1:02:45] and let us run with passion the race
[1:02:48] that is set before me
[1:02:51] that takes discipline
[1:02:53] discipline ask any musicians
[1:02:56] that takes i know because i'm just kind
[1:02:59] of a partial
[1:03:01] musician
[1:03:02] kenny's a complete one
[1:03:05] i'm a partial i pick on kenny because
[1:03:07] he's my
[1:03:08] son-in-law so
[1:03:10] i cannot pick on you i don't know you
[1:03:12] will
[1:03:13] you might get mad at
[1:03:14] me and anyway the only thing he can do
[1:03:17] just send me back to tucson
[1:03:22] anyway i'm just trying to pick on him so
[1:03:25] he can send me two to son
[1:03:27] anyway
[1:03:28] you know
[1:03:31] i'm just a partial musician but
[1:03:33] it takes a lot of discipline
[1:03:36] to be a musician
[1:03:38] to be anything it takes discipline
[1:03:40] but i don't know how people put all the
[1:03:42] energy
[1:03:43] and effort into that
[1:03:45] and maybe to become something when we
[1:03:48] had to put the same effort and energy to
[1:03:50] become what we who we are and what we
[1:03:53] are to be it takes the same or even more
[1:03:56] effort
[1:03:57] to become me
[1:03:59] not this the me that is inside me
[1:04:02] okay now
[1:04:04] then desire
[1:04:07] creates devotion
[1:04:09] once you have a desire
[1:04:11] nobody can keep you away from church
[1:04:14] not even
[1:04:16] the devil and all his demons in hell
[1:04:19] can keep you from church
[1:04:21] see
[1:04:22] i want to finish because time is
[1:04:25] of the essence
[1:04:27] my goodness one o'clock okay let me read
[1:04:29] this it's kind of lengthy but let me i
[1:04:32] won't make no comments i just read
[1:04:33] through it uh revelation chapter five
[1:04:36] now
[1:04:40] revelation chapter um i mean a quote
[1:04:43] i want you to read it with me so i don't
[1:04:45] have to explain
[1:04:49] do i missed it on my notes or something
[1:04:52] yeah i do that a lot
[1:04:56] okay
[1:04:58] i start reading
[1:05:00] now notice
[1:05:01] it was
[1:05:03] it was a lamb redeemer
[1:05:05] and lamb redeemer just like the first
[1:05:08] god never can change
[1:05:11] listen if god had a thought about you
[1:05:14] then
[1:05:16] it's staying still the same thought
[1:05:19] today
[1:05:20] and forever now you and i like a brother
[1:05:23] from germany you know brother brennan
[1:05:25] had those seven mountains up and down
[1:05:29] you might have a change of mind about
[1:05:31] things
[1:05:32] and you might go into the valleys and
[1:05:34] sometimes you're going glory glory
[1:05:36] hallelujah sometimes well me and you
[1:05:38] know
[1:05:39] but you're going through all those
[1:05:41] changes
[1:05:42] but god never change
[1:05:45] he's still the same yesterday today and
[1:05:48] forever
[1:05:49] so when you go to your changes it's
[1:05:51] because god is working on you
[1:05:53] but god
[1:05:54] never
[1:05:55] changed
[1:05:57] he says amen
[1:05:59] the first redeemer was a lamb in the
[1:06:01] garden of eden
[1:06:02] it was the lamb that got offered
[1:06:04] and here it is again plum over the
[1:06:08] revelation it is again the lamb
[1:06:10] lamb there the lamb over here
[1:06:13] to redeem what
[1:06:15] the falling condition and the fallen
[1:06:18] inheritance
[1:06:19] not only me but my inheritance
[1:06:22] to redeem what it belongs to me
[1:06:25] it says
[1:06:26] of a fallen race of people
[1:06:29] islam comes back to redeem like our like
[1:06:33] ours was at the beginning so whatever i
[1:06:36] had at the beginning that i lost it
[1:06:38] because i fell
[1:06:40] the redeemer the lamb came to redeem all
[1:06:42] that for me
[1:06:44] anything that's redeemed is something
[1:06:47] that
[1:06:48] that's been lost
[1:06:49] okay thank you brother
[1:06:52] it is it is something that being lost
[1:06:54] and then it is being brought back again
[1:06:57] so you were here in his mind he had a
[1:06:59] picture of you he took a picture of the
[1:07:01] family
[1:07:02] and that picture has never changed when
[1:07:04] he comes over here will be the same
[1:07:06] picture
[1:07:07] it doesn't matter what happened here
[1:07:10] that is so he in his mind
[1:07:13] that is vision
[1:07:14] it says
[1:07:16] and redeem what he says anything that is
[1:07:19] redeemed is something that has fallen
[1:07:21] it's something that being lost and then
[1:07:23] it is being brought back again
[1:07:25] what does he bring back to us
[1:07:27] islam
[1:07:28] everything
[1:07:30] that we had
[1:07:31] at the beginning
[1:07:33] glory to god
[1:07:35] so you haven't lost anything yet and you
[1:07:38] won't lose anything yet
[1:07:40] satan don't put one on you listen here
[1:07:42] we go
[1:07:43] it's a vision
[1:07:44] what did we have at the beginning
[1:07:46] eternal life
[1:07:49] we were heirs of the world
[1:07:52] we had life
[1:07:54] we never had to die
[1:07:56] we never had to be sick we never had to
[1:07:59] get old
[1:08:00] thank god we never had to be worried
[1:08:03] there was no funerals no grave no evil
[1:08:06] not dead no gray hairs no two shoulders
[1:08:09] no morning no crying oh man i want to
[1:08:12] get there
[1:08:15] here we suffer and we fight a lot
[1:08:18] that's your vision that's who you are
[1:08:21] eternal with the eternal
[1:08:26] it says
[1:08:27] walk about
[1:08:28] it says
[1:08:30] we had life eternal
[1:08:32] i must keep this one here 94 and now
[1:08:35] nature itself is groaning
[1:08:38] it's growing waiting for what
[1:08:41] for the manifestations
[1:08:43] of the sons of god for the sons of god
[1:08:47] to be one manifested
[1:08:51] and we have
[1:08:52] to earnest and we have the earnest of
[1:08:54] our salvation now
[1:08:57] and can take a brother that is dying
[1:09:00] with cancer now listen
[1:09:02] now
[1:09:04] so this is what gets a little bit
[1:09:07] grace for some people
[1:09:09] listen
[1:09:10] when we get there we are
[1:09:12] completely changed i'm not need no
[1:09:14] healing
[1:09:15] but do i need heal i'm complete
[1:09:18] i'm not going to need to die i don't
[1:09:20] what do i need there
[1:09:22] nothing
[1:09:23] i'm done
[1:09:24] but that don't mean
[1:09:26] that you don't need that now
[1:09:29] so what he's saying is you don't have to
[1:09:31] wait there to start practicing what you
[1:09:33] already are
[1:09:36] you say
[1:09:37] it's a brother with cancer he says
[1:09:42] and stand by that little breath of
[1:09:44] redemption
[1:09:45] and pray the prayers of faith over him
[1:09:48] and that's what the brother was
[1:09:50] preaching
[1:09:51] prayer
[1:09:52] he says
[1:09:54] prayer of faith over him that turns a
[1:09:56] shadow of a man back to what to a
[1:09:59] healthy man again
[1:10:00] what will we do when our full possession
[1:10:03] comes
[1:10:04] partially
[1:10:06] partially we can do
[1:10:08] what we
[1:10:09] supposed to do
[1:10:11] there
[1:10:12] here
[1:10:13] you know i'm i need it right now
[1:10:16] i need it right now people are depressed
[1:10:19] people are sick afflicted people are
[1:10:21] dying i don't need it there
[1:10:24] i need it right now um because the fact
[1:10:26] that it's mine and i'm walking towards
[1:10:29] is to shine
[1:10:31] as i get closer and closer those things
[1:10:34] should be happening in the congregation
[1:10:37] you know why because it's not going to
[1:10:39] be a show any longer
[1:10:41] but i say it's not going to be a show
[1:10:43] so the things that are happening day and
[1:10:45] day and day and day and there
[1:10:48] and that's why you need to testify
[1:10:50] because i don't know what's going on
[1:10:51] there until you tell me
[1:10:54] see because sometimes you come to church
[1:10:56] and you come to church
[1:10:58] why nothing is happening in church
[1:11:01] this is more than the nomination but
[1:11:02] that show
[1:11:04] to get money
[1:11:05] to build a kingdom
[1:11:08] but here because we are sons and
[1:11:09] daughters of god and we humble we don't
[1:11:12] like to let the left
[1:11:14] know what the right is doing and we
[1:11:16] don't want to give no glory to anybody
[1:11:18] but him we kind of like to keep it to
[1:11:21] ourselves like mary she kept a lot of
[1:11:23] things
[1:11:24] but you know in her
[1:11:27] but
[1:11:27] because it's not going to be a show
[1:11:29] things are happening
[1:11:31] that show that the presence of god is
[1:11:33] here
[1:11:34] but you need to testify
[1:11:36] to the rest of it so we know that
[1:11:38] god is a work
[1:11:40] and his presence is in this place
[1:11:43] he says
[1:11:44] and pray the prayer of faith over him
[1:11:46] and that shadow of man back to a healthy
[1:11:49] man again what will we do when our full
[1:11:52] possession comes but i don't want to get
[1:11:54] to my full position to pray for myself i
[1:11:57] don't need it
[1:11:58] i need it right now
[1:12:00] and if you are that close
[1:12:02] you should be shining now
[1:12:06] nature knows that
[1:12:07] nature's growing groaning and we are
[1:12:09] groaning with it nature is waiting for
[1:12:12] the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:12:16] that that you are there
[1:12:18] you still hear the same
[1:12:20] partially so you are now
[1:12:24] that's what the bible said you are now
[1:12:27] the sons of god
[1:12:29] not that you are going to be
[1:12:31] you are now
[1:12:34] and all that is in you
[1:12:36] partially
[1:12:38] and one of these days is gonna bloom
[1:12:40] completely
[1:12:41] and the closer you get
[1:12:43] the better it gets
[1:12:45] it says because we're gonna see the
[1:12:47] presence of god so strong in our
[1:12:50] churches but it's not going to be a show
[1:12:52] the national file he says
[1:12:54] because the nature was cursed with his
[1:12:56] master
[1:12:57] when his master was cursed
[1:13:00] the nature of
[1:13:01] the nature fell with the master i like
[1:13:04] it
[1:13:05] says but when the kingsman even came
[1:13:08] hallelujah and reading back the man
[1:13:11] that the master
[1:13:12] you're not talking about christ or god
[1:13:14] the master
[1:13:16] he says over the nature
[1:13:20] then all nature is waiting for
[1:13:23] the main
[1:13:24] master
[1:13:27] what do we do
[1:13:29] it says
[1:13:31] in case you missed it
[1:13:33] you are the master
[1:13:35] when i was feeling
[1:13:37] you are the master of your choices
[1:13:40] satan is not the master of you
[1:13:43] it's not the boss of you
[1:13:45] but you got to be proven that you are
[1:13:48] the master of this earth
[1:13:50] god is the master of heavens on earth
[1:13:52] but you was put here
[1:13:55] to show
[1:13:56] god
[1:13:58] you see rabbi says the only place that
[1:14:00] people want to see god today is where
[1:14:03] in
[1:14:04] you in you in you
[1:14:06] see they're looking for god
[1:14:09] and you got it
[1:14:11] see and we need to manifest
[1:14:13] god
[1:14:15] it says
[1:14:17] what do we do
[1:14:18] then we take the axe and sleep
[1:14:20] our hands chop the tree down
[1:14:23] if we want to if we want to but that day
[1:14:26] we won't do that she's talking about
[1:14:28] abraham
[1:14:29] and her leader brian
[1:14:31] when he was in the garden she said i
[1:14:33] don't like that tree there adam can you
[1:14:35] move it here and he just poked it and we
[1:14:38] went
[1:14:39] so we don't have to do that anymore not
[1:14:40] there
[1:14:42] i need it here
[1:14:44] i need to speak
[1:14:45] you know let it be the will in heaven
[1:14:47] let it be done in earth
[1:14:49] god knows the will in heaven is complete
[1:14:51] we know what he wants he knows what he
[1:14:54] has calling us he knows you know the
[1:14:56] purpose you have been called
[1:14:58] but you have to voice it
[1:15:00] in this side of time
[1:15:03] he already is completed in heaven
[1:15:06] but then he needs someone to believe it
[1:15:09] and give it a voice
[1:15:13] so
[1:15:14] when you want something just voice his
[1:15:16] will
[1:15:17] that's all that's easy spoken word
[1:15:22] we do that okay all nature is waiting
[1:15:24] for the master see
[1:15:26] and the master is the sons of god here
[1:15:28] we go that was given this earth
[1:15:31] you are in control of this earth
[1:15:34] not satan
[1:15:37] i mean they got their own team going but
[1:15:38] that's 13
[1:15:40] that's not my thing
[1:15:42] but see i got a leader
[1:15:44] world
[1:15:45] you know bravo says you have enough
[1:15:47] faith you can create a world and go on
[1:15:50] what
[1:15:51] believing it well
[1:15:52] i don't think we need to do that but
[1:15:55] what he's trying to illustrate is
[1:15:57] that you can create your own atmosphere
[1:15:59] around you
[1:16:01] your own world
[1:16:02] so anybody come in contact with your
[1:16:04] atmosphere huh you change
[1:16:08] see you create your own atmosphere
[1:16:10] brother brandon got in the house and
[1:16:12] meet on them and the kids were running
[1:16:14] and kicking them you know how it is
[1:16:16] your mother's and you're almost loosing
[1:16:18] it and then he comes in and first thing
[1:16:21] he do he gets next to her
[1:16:23] and they start doing dishes and how was
[1:16:25] your day and
[1:16:26] and he tried to change her mind
[1:16:29] you know because if she stayed in that
[1:16:30] mind you cannot change
[1:16:32] the mind has to change
[1:16:34] so she brings it from all that situation
[1:16:37] and start talking to her so she can kind
[1:16:39] of
[1:16:40] you know don't focus on that
[1:16:42] and after a while the atmosphere changes
[1:16:45] the whole thing changes why
[1:16:48] that is you you are the master
[1:16:51] of your own
[1:16:52] little world
[1:16:55] and you can change it anytime
[1:16:57] you want to
[1:16:59] you don't like the way somebody's doing
[1:17:01] something don't go and change them
[1:17:03] that won't work you're not here to
[1:17:05] change me and i'm not going to change
[1:17:07] you but if i change my arm of fear
[1:17:09] i might be able for you to walk in it
[1:17:16] when the work is finished
[1:17:18] we all
[1:17:20] we have all things again praise the lord
[1:17:23] we we
[1:17:25] restore
[1:17:26] redeem
[1:17:27] restore
[1:17:28] and complete
[1:17:30] that's the vision
[1:17:33] but i don't have to wait there to
[1:17:34] believe that i already believe that i
[1:17:36] have all things
[1:17:38] in jesus christ
[1:17:41] we have all things again what kind of a
[1:17:43] thing we have
[1:17:44] power
[1:17:46] we have eternal life
[1:17:48] we have eternal health
[1:17:49] we have eternal youth we have eternal
[1:17:52] power
[1:17:53] all all we just eternal with eternal
[1:17:58] we are coming to be eternal walking into
[1:18:00] the eternal with eternal life
[1:18:03] it says
[1:18:05] we are waiting
[1:18:07] for that time to come
[1:18:09] waiting
[1:18:10] and
[1:18:10] groaning i got one more call but i must
[1:18:13] stop here
[1:18:15] you can stand for me please
[1:18:24] musician you can come to
[1:18:32] again a vision
[1:18:34] a vision is necessary
[1:18:37] and i hope that this morning if you had
[1:18:40] one that i refreshed
[1:18:42] the vision for you
[1:18:44] the reason i feel so good when i come
[1:18:46] here because my vision is your past your
[1:18:48] vision
[1:18:50] where you think we can get along now i
[1:18:52] didn't say i agree with everything he do
[1:18:54] and he don't agree with everything i do
[1:18:56] i've been married to my wife for some
[1:18:57] years and i still don't agree with some
[1:18:58] things
[1:18:59] so how can you explain me to agree with
[1:19:01] him in all things
[1:19:02] that's not what i said
[1:19:04] i said we have the same
[1:19:07] vision
[1:19:08] we had the same vision of the spanish
[1:19:10] translation
[1:19:12] that's why we can come together and do
[1:19:14] what we do because we have a vision and
[1:19:16] we can come into that vision
[1:19:18] and you we can unite
[1:19:20] in that vision
[1:19:22] but it has to come from god
[1:19:24] and you know it comes from god when you
[1:19:26] can unite
[1:19:28] and get the work done
[1:19:31] amen
[1:19:32] a vision and if you never had a vision
[1:19:35] it's a good time to get one
[1:19:38] it is time
[1:19:39] if you never thought about it the way i
[1:19:41] brought it to you
[1:19:43] it is time
[1:19:45] to get focused
[1:19:46] to get a vision of who you are
[1:19:49] what you are
[1:19:50] what you are to be and start working
[1:19:52] towards that
[1:19:54] and like i said
[1:19:56] once you do that
[1:19:58] the rest is easy discipline yourself
[1:20:01] there will be frustrations that will be
[1:20:03] up and down but you won't give up you
[1:20:06] get up and you continue towards the
[1:20:08] vision
[1:20:09] and god will then give you the
[1:20:11] desire
[1:20:13] because you cannot make yourself
[1:20:14] dishearten anything you know that
[1:20:16] you know that you cannot even make sir
[1:20:18] desperate
[1:20:19] if god don't make you desperate you stay
[1:20:21] there
[1:20:23] so
[1:20:24] once you prove that you want to
[1:20:26] discipline this is what i want to do
[1:20:28] lord that's
[1:20:29] mary said be unto me that is it be unto
[1:20:32] me and i'm gonna do whatever i can
[1:20:35] you know physically
[1:20:37] to get there
[1:20:38] so help me lord
[1:20:40] so he will give you a desire an option
[1:20:43] to keep moving
[1:20:44] and then
[1:20:45] when you keep moving
[1:20:47] you start getting
[1:20:48] you create a devotion
[1:20:50] for god
[1:20:52] you know what i mean i don't have to beg
[1:20:53] for you to come to church and worship
[1:20:55] god
[1:20:57] you want to worship god
[1:20:59] you know that brother brown said one of
[1:21:01] these days the stores people will be
[1:21:03] making the line i haven't seen that yet
[1:21:06] so he has to come in line that is so
[1:21:07] much devotion
[1:21:10] that people will line up in the door
[1:21:11] waiting for the deacon to open the
[1:21:13] deacon is late anyway
[1:21:15] sometimes
[1:21:17] i haven't seen lines in the door have
[1:21:19] you
[1:21:20] no
[1:21:21] maybe we need more devotion
[1:21:24] maybe we need let god create more
[1:21:27] desire
[1:21:29] strong desire
[1:21:31] for the things of god
[1:21:33] and then
[1:21:35] you can become
[1:21:37] very
[1:21:38] very
[1:21:39] emerge
[1:21:40] devotion you come to church and now you
[1:21:43] want to be a church
[1:21:45] the only reason you're here
[1:21:47] is because you love god
[1:21:49] i cannot make you come to church
[1:21:52] i cannot force you i cannot push you
[1:21:55] if you don't love god that's all it is
[1:21:57] to it but a devotion for god creates a
[1:22:00] love such a great love
[1:22:03] that you want to be
[1:22:04] where he's at
[1:22:06] hallelujah let us pray
[1:22:08] father
