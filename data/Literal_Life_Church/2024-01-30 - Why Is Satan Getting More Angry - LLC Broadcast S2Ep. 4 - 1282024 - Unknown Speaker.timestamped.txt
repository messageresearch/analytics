[8:10] Daniel chapter 3 and verse 16 if we
[8:13] could read together before we're seated
[8:16] Shadrach mesach and abedo answered and
[8:19] said to the king oh Nebuchadnezzar we
[8:21] are not careful to answer thee in this
[8:23] matter if it be so our God whom we serve
[8:26] is able to Deliver Us From The Burning
[8:28] fiery furnace and he will deliver us out
[8:30] of thine hand O King but if not be it
[8:33] known unto thee Oh King that we will not
[8:35] serve thy Gods nor worship the golden
[8:37] image which thou H has set up then then
[8:41] was Nebuchadnezzar full of Fury and the
[8:45] form of his Visage was changed against
[8:48] Shadrach Meshach and abedo therefore he
[8:51] spake and commanded that they should
[8:54] heat the furnace one seven times more
[8:57] than it won't to be Heat heed 2 Timothy
[9:01] chapter 3 in the New Testament we add
[9:03] some scriptures here to the the text and
[9:06] the context 2 Timothy chapter
[9:10] 3 verse
[9:12] 12 yay in all that will live Godly in
[9:16] Christ Jesus shall suffer
[9:22] persecution but evil men and seducers
[9:25] shall wax worse and worse deceiving and
[9:30] being deceived evil men and seducers
[9:33] shall wax worse and worse doesn't say
[9:37] that it it it will get better and better
[9:40] as you have many years as a
[9:42] Christian um if you're living Godly in
[9:45] Christ Jesus then the spirits and the
[9:48] the forces against you will get worse
[9:50] and
[9:51] worse evil men and seducers shall wax
[9:54] worse and worse deceiving and being
[9:56] deceived and I want to speak a little
[9:58] bit tonight in in the service on why is
[10:00] s Satan getting more angry it's one
[10:03] thing if we know about Christ Jesus of
[10:06] 2000 years ago in our stories from
[10:08] Sunday school and we see the four
[10:11] gospels and we see he lived 33 years and
[10:13] we see his fleshly days here on Earth
[10:16] but it's another thing that God drops a
[10:18] revelation of who Christ really is and
[10:21] actually the new birth is the revelation
[10:24] of Jesus Christ personally to you not
[10:27] just the church receives it not just
[10:29] just uh a group that receives it but
[10:31] it's personally to you the new birth is
[10:34] a revelation of Christ personally to you
[10:37] and when that Revelation comes listen I
[10:39] can tell you it's not just that you
[10:41] understand Jesus in the four gospels
[10:43] Christ becomes real and personal to you
[10:46] and so that that TI that title is is an
[10:48] announcement it's it's what is happening
[10:50] now secretly and we're just not talking
[10:54] about his life here on Earth but who he
[10:56] is is revealed in the day in its
[10:58] fullness in this day day it in its
[11:00] fullness Christ will be revealed in his
[11:02] fullness and who is he revealing it to
[11:06] he's revealing it to his body his people
[11:09] because we are the body of Christ if the
[11:13] body of Christ is without the head then
[11:15] she's not really the body of Christ how
[11:18] many believe tonight and I'm just laying
[11:19] in some foundational statements that I
[11:21] know you will at least nod to an amen
[11:24] would be nice but if you nod to it how
[11:25] many you believe Christ is the head of
[11:28] the church he's the head he's the if we
[11:31] want to call it he's the brains he's the
[11:33] he's the one that directs just like your
[11:34] body your head if you cut your head off
[11:36] your finished the body has no function
[11:38] without the head and so Christ is the
[11:40] head of the body the body has nothing
[11:42] can't be nourished can't be filled can't
[11:45] can't move can you say Amen without the
[11:47] head and so now in the end time we see
[11:51] Paul and Colossians saying the head that
[11:53] he is the head and by him and through
[11:55] him consist all things and she is the
[11:58] body but the the head must be connected
[12:00] in a union with the body and through
[12:03] denominational ages of 2,000 years
[12:06] denominational ideas has so destroyed
[12:10] the word of God and taken away from the
[12:11] word of God that you take away from the
[12:14] husband Christ and the body has become
[12:16] detached from the
[12:18] head but in the end time the head
[12:21] returns and reveals himself and when the
[12:24] head comes back and the body catches it
[12:26] she becomes one with him for a rapture
[12:30] so that's the prophecy for the end time
[12:32] and so it's him who's revealing himself
[12:34] to his body his people that's what's
[12:36] happening right now spiritually that's
[12:38] what's happening we can talk about
[12:40] what's happening in the news we can take
[12:42] prophecy and and bring all these things
[12:44] but what spiritually happened is the
[12:46] bride has recognizing her headship
[12:50] Christ has returned you say well he's
[12:53] returned uh not in a physical body yet
[12:56] but because that's when we meet him in
[12:57] the air but Christ Christ has returned
[12:59] in the fullness of his word why has he
[13:02] done that because he's the head and the
[13:04] body's got to connect with it before
[13:06] Rapture and so when she recognizes her
[13:08] headship her true headship and her
[13:10] headship is not a denominational head
[13:12] her headship is not a church her
[13:15] headquarters is not somewhere here on
[13:18] Earth she's recognizing her true
[13:21] headship which is Christ the word and
[13:25] that is what's happening in True
[13:26] Believers she's recognizing her head
[13:29] Christ is here he is my head I'm
[13:31] becoming one with him and his word is
[13:33] coming through him that I'm truly his
[13:35] body let me say it this way Christ is
[13:38] the head of the
[13:39] body and the body at the end time
[13:42] recognizes that this is our this is our
[13:45] head Christ that's come back to us the
[13:47] word has come back to us again through
[13:49] denominational ideas he's restored the
[13:51] full word back to us and thus Christ our
[13:54] head is back and it's revealed to her
[13:56] this is him this is the one we seen
[13:59] 2,000 years ago this is the true Christ
[14:01] revealed and when she recognizes my head
[14:04] is here this is Christ she Embraces it
[14:06] she becomes one with it by the Holy
[14:08] Ghost and when she does she becomes his
[14:11] hands and his feet on
[14:14] Earth where's Jesus he's in his people
[14:17] what's the final manifestation to this
[14:20] world of Christ not Jesus in the air but
[14:24] Jesus in his
[14:26] body can you say Amen we meet him in the
[14:29] air but when the word comes back
[14:32] according to Revelations 1 he sets his
[14:34] foot upon the Land and Sea Christ that
[14:36] Covenant angel that rainbow Angel that's
[14:38] Christ there and when he comes down and
[14:39] descends that's not a physical return
[14:42] the physical return is to meet him in
[14:44] the air in a Rapture that this is a word
[14:46] returning of Christ the full word
[14:48] because that's who how many let me step
[14:50] back a bit how many know that Christ is
[14:53] not just the physical body that was here
[14:55] 2,000 years ago Christ is the word right
[14:59] he's the person of the
[15:02] word John 1 And1 in the beginning was
[15:05] the word Matthew starts out the birth of
[15:07] Jesus in the story L Mark Luke tells
[15:10] about the the beginnings being the birth
[15:12] of Christ John starts it with with the
[15:15] eagle anointing on John he starts the
[15:17] whole Beginnings not at the birth of
[15:20] Christ but to tell who this Christ
[15:22] really was and that was in the beginning
[15:24] was the word and the Word was with God
[15:27] and the Word was God
[15:29] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[15:32] Among Us that's John's Eagle Eye
[15:35] describing what this birth of Christ was
[15:38] who is he well he was a Healer who is he
[15:42] he's a counselor he's a princip please
[15:45] but if you miss the part that he is the
[15:47] word revealed in every
[15:49] generation that is Christ when Christ
[15:52] Reveals His word to any generation
[15:54] that's a revealing of Christ and when he
[15:56] brings the word to that generation
[15:57] that's Christ revealing ring himself
[15:59] Jesus is the word Christ is the word can
[16:04] you say Amen so she comes under this
[16:07] headship she forsakes all o others uh
[16:10] all the other man's ideas she leaves she
[16:13] exits you find this in the Book of
[16:15] Revelations where babylon's there
[16:18] Babylon is a is means religious
[16:21] confusion and the world is full of
[16:23] religious confusion especially in
[16:25] Christianity and the call to the bride
[16:29] at the last days is to come out of her
[16:31] my people her come out of come out of
[16:35] that system come out of that Babylonian
[16:38] religious confusion and come to where
[16:40] come back to the word praise the Lord
[16:44] come back to the true headship and
[16:46] there's a people it won't be a church
[16:48] doing it won't be this church it's a
[16:50] it's individuals coming back to the word
[16:52] and she comes back forsakes all the
[16:54] other men's ideas forsaking all others
[16:56] like a wife does when she stands in a
[16:58] wedding and she makes a commitment to
[17:00] that one man the bride makes a
[17:02] commitment to one man Jesus Christ all
[17:04] others I forsake all others it's like
[17:06] she takes a vow can you say am man it's
[17:08] a more it's a more serious vow than what
[17:10] the girls and the guys take at the altar
[17:12] that's serious but the one you take to
[17:14] Christ uh I'll serve you for richer for
[17:17] poor in sickness and in health I'm not
[17:20] going to leave you I'm committed to you
[17:21] and forsaking all others as long as I
[17:24] shall live that's the commitment we make
[17:26] to our headship Jesus Christ praise the
[17:28] Lord so she does it and when she does
[17:31] when she does that the bride now in this
[17:33] hour it sets her in a Rapture condition
[17:36] to be restored Back to Eden praise the
[17:38] Lord so now now you see now I said that
[17:44] because it gives the roots of the root
[17:47] of Satan's
[17:49] anger the root of Satan's anger is not
[17:52] that just he don't like you but the root
[17:55] of Satan's anger is this bride becoming
[17:58] one with her head Christ can you say
[18:01] Amen when you are becoming one and
[18:04] bringing your life through the word and
[18:06] giving him the preeminence in your life
[18:09] and making him number one in your life
[18:11] when he he hates that more than anything
[18:13] because Satan has learned something and
[18:15] you know I feel very confident tonight
[18:17] if I don't get a lot of amens I'm going
[18:19] to give the devil a black eye tonight I
[18:21] don't care because he does not like me
[18:23] preaching like this cuz this is what's
[18:25] happening now I'm going to tell you
[18:27] what's making saying Satan angry from
[18:30] the beginning but he's also getting
[18:32] becoming more Angry as we get closer to
[18:35] this Union and this oness in this
[18:36] Rapture he's getting more Angry that's
[18:39] why the prophet took the Rapture text in
[18:40] Psalms 27 though a host should be
[18:42] encamped around me I will not fear hide
[18:46] me in thy Pavilion Lord praise the Lord
[18:49] why because as the everything
[18:51] intensifies and once intensifying oh
[18:53] world the world's the politics
[18:55] everything's intensifying everything's
[18:57] Under Pressure but why isn't Under
[18:58] Pressure we're coming to the end of
[19:00] prophecies being fulfilled in the people
[19:03] of God the body of Christ she's coming
[19:05] to that moment where she's letting this
[19:07] word go through her and Satan can see
[19:09] some of the results of it and he's
[19:11] getting more angry at your life if
[19:13] you're the one bringing your life
[19:15] through the word and your family through
[19:16] the word he's becoming more angry at
[19:18] your family he's not going to walk away
[19:21] he's going to stand there more angry at
[19:23] you Satan can't move a man with a
[19:27] revelation
[19:31] he can mess with your spirit he can
[19:33] depress you he can discourage you he can
[19:37] speak to your mind but one day that's
[19:39] going to be over too he can accuse you
[19:41] you're not a son of God look at the M
[19:43] mistakes you made he can say your spirit
[19:45] can get low sometimes you can get
[19:48] physically sick in the body but then God
[19:50] can heal you can you say amen he can
[19:52] tamper with the outer two Realms of
[19:55] spirit and flesh because those two
[19:56] aren't born again
[19:59] but he can't get to the Revelation that
[20:02] God has deposited in your
[20:06] heart this is what makes Satan so angry
[20:10] it helps us to be a mature adopted
[20:13] Sons when you have that situation where
[20:16] all that live in Godly in Christ Jesus
[20:18] and take a stand and have a revelation
[20:21] shall suffer persecution and when it
[20:23] comes you stand surefooted and you still
[20:26] confident because that person angry with
[20:29] me it's not the person it's the devil
[20:31] doesn't like what I have remember I
[20:34] talked about a few weeks ago the Devils
[20:36] learned this that the people get get a
[20:38] revelation and they act upon it
[20:41] from from
[20:44] uh
[20:46] able all the way through to the bride
[20:48] today Satan has learned that the people
[20:50] that get a revelation God bypasses Satan
[20:53] gives it to them even when they weren't
[20:54] worthy of it and Satan hates when they
[20:57] get a revelation
[20:59] from Abel how did Abel bring a blood
[21:02] sacrifice and King brought
[21:05] fruits one thing
[21:08] Revelation he caught a revelation there
[21:10] nobody there was no Bible there was no
[21:13] teaching on it there was no seminars on
[21:16] it got a revelation from God that it was
[21:20] blood that we fell by and now it takes
[21:23] blood to get us back so I'm bringing
[21:25] this bloody animal I'm SL slitting I'm
[21:27] going to slit his throat I'm going to
[21:28] let the blood come all over all of it
[21:30] and and Cain is over here on this side
[21:33] and he says I think it's good fruits in
[21:35] our lives if that God honors good fruits
[21:37] and so he makes this beautiful table
[21:39] with all kinds of lush fruits on it
[21:41] God's going to be impressed with all of
[21:43] my good fruits makes it beautiful and
[21:46] Abel is over here and he don't know but
[21:48] just by Revelation he just does it and
[21:50] there's this big bloody table with a
[21:52] bloody animal around it and they both
[21:54] begin to worship and God says I accept
[21:57] Abels and I re reject
[22:01] Kings and the only difference was God
[22:04] dropped a revelation this is what you
[22:06] bring in
[22:07] worship not your own
[22:09] fruits not some flowery
[22:13] altar blood we needed blood we needed a
[22:17] sacrifice for our sins the only one
[22:19] provided place to worship God is under
[22:21] the shed blood of Jesus
[22:23] Christ no other place to worship Satan
[22:26] is not angry at borderline Believers
[22:28] Satan is not angry at
[22:30] compromisers Satan's not angry at the
[22:32] person who shouts Satan's not angry but
[22:35] you start living the life and you by a
[22:37] revelation you start living the life of
[22:39] Christ that's when Satan becomes more
[22:40] angry at you Satan is not howling of
[22:43] those things but he is getting more and
[22:45] more angry at the sons of God somebody
[22:48] is letting that word come through their
[22:49] lives and they are becoming with the
[22:51] word more and more he's getting his
[22:53] rightful position Christ is getting his
[22:56] rightful position in first first place
[22:58] in their lives and every question of
[23:00] life gets addressed by the word first
[23:03] because he is her or his head he's my
[23:07] head the word is my head it's not
[23:09] because of your personality it's not
[23:11] because you go to church Satan's not
[23:13] angry at you because you attend
[23:15] church that doesn't make there's
[23:18] hundreds of people thousands around the
[23:19] world that attend church some of them
[23:21] more faithful than
[23:23] you it's not that Satan's angry because
[23:26] you come to church and I'm really glad
[23:28] you're here tonight many come from
[23:29] distances an hour and a half away
[23:31] sometimes longer here tonight in the
[23:32] service God bless you some listening
[23:34] from many places God bless you but
[23:37] that's not what Satan is angry with you
[23:39] about it's the Revelation that you hold
[23:42] it's your dedication to come under God's
[23:44] headship it's your submission because
[23:46] only the bride will be submissive to
[23:47] this word the rest Rebel and say I'm not
[23:49] going to do that I'm going to pick and
[23:50] choose what I want out of the message
[23:52] she's not doing that she's saying I
[23:53] value it all I want
[23:55] it she becomes one with it
[23:58] you know why the king got mad you know
[24:00] why the king got mad and got in a fury
[24:03] about the Hebrews it's because of how
[24:05] they answered saying we are not going to
[24:07] Bow God can Deliver Us from the fire if
[24:10] you put us in there but we are not going
[24:12] to Bow if God doesn't Deliver us we if
[24:15] God if God delivers us praise be to God
[24:18] but if you throw us in there and God
[24:20] doesn't Deliver us we want to let you
[24:21] know we're still not bowing to this
[24:24] image praise the Lord they took a stand
[24:27] why did take a stand because they had
[24:29] the revelation of the true headship and
[24:31] Nebuchadnezzar was asking them to come
[24:32] under a different
[24:34] headship it was pressur to come under a
[24:37] different headship and worship a
[24:38] different image or worship a different
[24:40] thing just like the image of the beast
[24:42] of the last days he wants you to come
[24:44] under the Antichrist spirit and worship
[24:45] something different a new version of
[24:47] Jesus Christ a new version of
[24:48] Christianity but they said no we're not
[24:51] doing that we're not worship and so they
[24:53] would not bow to be swayed to worship at
[24:56] that image at the feet of that that
[24:57] image that everybody wanted them to and
[25:00] this is what made Satan angry it was
[25:03] their revelation of who to worship it's
[25:06] their revelation of TR who the true king
[25:08] was can you say Amen they refused to do
[25:11] it even if they died God raises up a
[25:14] people that are not afraid to die for
[25:16] this gospel God raises up young people
[25:18] that are not afraid to stand for the
[25:20] word of
[25:22] God and hold that Revelation in their
[25:25] heart he and then he goes heat up the
[25:27] furnace heat things up out of his Fury
[25:30] make it harder on him make it more scary
[25:32] and he thought by saying you know what
[25:34] I'm going to do I'm going to heat this
[25:35] up seven times hotter and he thought
[25:37] he's looking for a reaction from him and
[25:39] they're still
[25:41] just whatever you need to
[25:44] do but I'm going to heat it seven times
[25:50] harder whatever you need to do it's kind
[25:54] of like Jesus said to Judas you're
[25:57] delaying this thing whatever you need to
[25:58] do go do it
[26:00] quickly if you're going to try to cause
[26:02] a stir in the church don't wait go ahead
[26:05] and do it manifest what's in your heart
[26:07] get it done that's what he said to Jesus
[26:09] whatever you need to do do it quickly
[26:11] let's get it over
[26:12] with heat it up seven times why don't
[26:15] you try 14 times
[26:17] hotter because it doesn't matter in
[26:19] light of my Revelation it doesn't matter
[26:21] heat it up before the Rapture let it
[26:23] heat up all it wants
[26:25] to and why am I not afraid not because I
[26:28] have the intellectual fortitude to stand
[26:30] here and save young people and save
[26:32] people's lives from the onslaught of the
[26:34] sexual perversion and everything and the
[26:36] immodest of the immodesty of this age I
[26:39] don't have nothing in me to keep people
[26:41] back from that but I've got a word and a
[26:43] holy ghost that'll keep people from it
[26:45] and I'm going to keep preaching it cuz
[26:47] that's our hope it's the token that kept
[26:49] the death angel
[26:50] away it's the token applied to the home
[26:53] in the front post of the door it's the
[26:55] Holy Ghost the token is the Holy Ghost
[26:57] and I've I've got that to preach to you
[26:59] and that'll be your protection in this

[27:03] reason that Satan is getting more and
