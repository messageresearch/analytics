[1:10] with his word Judges chapter 13 and I
[1:13] just want to begin reading here we're
[1:16] going to just begin reading here at
[1:17] verse one and read a few verses I'm
[1:19] going to minister to you tonight on
[1:21] something that the Lord just quickened
[1:24] to my heart even right before just there
[1:25] in the back office and uh just wanting
[1:28] to wait on him and be obedient to the
[1:30] Holy Spirit you believe that Lord has
[1:32] all things in control even the little
[1:35] small details you know the Lord is in
[1:37] the small little details go read The
[1:39] Book of Leviticus when God tells Moses
[1:41] how to build the Tabernacle it wasn't
[1:43] generic it wasn't just build me a
[1:45] building build something nice build
[1:46] something beautiful but God was very
[1:49] detailed specific
[1:51] engineered exactly the way I've don't
[1:54] deviate Moses from any part of it build
[1:57] it exactly as you see it the colors the
[2:00] jewels the the vessels the how the the
[2:02] measurements down to the very inch to
[2:05] the centimeter you know what that tells
[2:07] me about God God's not generic and
[2:09] there's not just a generic way that Lit
[2:12] pleases the Lord but I believe that that
[2:14] God is very specific he's got a specific
[2:17] card and I believe the Lord's in the
[2:18] smallest details of our life even in the
[2:21] simple things and so tonight we just
[2:24] want to minister to you something very
[2:26] simple upon our heart and I'm going to
[2:28] title this the value of the spirit
[2:31] the value of the spirit verse 1 of
[2:35] Judges chapter 13.
[2:37] and the children of Israel did Evil
[2:39] again in the sight of the Lord and the
[2:42] Lord delivered them into the hand of the
[2:43] Philistines 40 years
[2:46] verse 3 and the angel of the Lord
[2:48] appeared unto the woman and said unto
[2:50] her behold now Thou Art Barren
[2:52] embarrassed not but Thou shalt conceive
[2:55] and bear a son
[2:56] now therefore beware now therefore
[2:59] beware I pray thee and drink not wine
[3:01] nor strong drink and eat not any unclean
[3:05] thing for the Lo Thou shalt conceive and
[3:09] bear a son and no razor shall come on
[3:12] his head for the child shall be a
[3:14] Nazarite unto God notice this
[3:18] from the womb
[3:21] so in other words God's purpose for your
[3:23] life didn't begin when you gave your
[3:26] heart to the Lord or when you caught the
[3:28] revelation of the message
[3:30] but God's purpose for you actually
[3:33] started before you ever breathed your
[3:35] first breath
[3:37] and he made a promise and he had a
[3:39] vision and he has a plan and long before
[3:42] you ever came to be or ever came to your
[3:44] first struggle God already charted your
[3:48] course
[3:49] from the Cradle to the Grave
[3:52] how many Believers we have here that
[3:54] would believe that
[3:55] for low than that the child should be a
[3:57] Nazareth unto God from the womb and he
[4:00] shall begin to deliver Israel out of the
[4:02] hand of the Philistines the woman came
[4:05] and told her husband saying a man of God
[4:07] came unto me and his countenance was
[4:09] like the countenance of an angel of God
[4:12] very terrible which is our English word
[4:14] and actually the word there is awesome
[4:16] but I asked him not when she was neither
[4:19] told me his name
[4:20] but he said unto me behold and she
[4:23] repeats the words but notice what this
[4:26] mother says here behold Thou shalt
[4:28] conceive and bear a son and now drink no
[4:31] wine nor strong drink nor eat any
[4:33] unclean thing for the child shall be a
[4:36] Nazarite to God from the womb to the day
[4:40] of his death how powerful is the purpose
[4:44] of God when God purposes something in a
[4:46] life
[4:47] and so much that God's purpose never
[4:50] left Samson's life even though Samson
[4:53] left God's purpose
[4:56] notice here then the manoaan treated the
[4:58] Lord and said oh my Lord let the man of
[5:01] God which thou did Sin come again unto
[5:03] us and teach us what we shall do unto
[5:05] the child that shall be born God hearken
[5:08] to the voice of minoan the angel of God
[5:10] came again unto the woman as she sat in
[5:13] the field but Manoa her husband was not
[5:15] with her
[5:17] let's just bow our heads together maybe
[5:19] if you have something upon your heart
[5:20] that you just want us to pray about
[5:22] maybe here tonight before you just want
[5:24] to raise the hand and say Lord come and
[5:26] meet my need you just want to hold that
[5:27] hand up to the Lord right now
[5:29] Lord Jesus father you see our hands Lord
[5:32] that are up my hands both Lord right now
[5:35] God I just at this moment Lord there's
[5:38] nothing in me Lord Jesus I think of
[5:41] myself standing here
[5:43] Lord and who am I God just nobody
[5:47] Lord and have nothing in myself Lord
[5:50] that I could give anybody Lord that
[5:53] would be of any kind of Eternal benefit
[5:55] Lord I can say like David what is man
[5:58] that thou art mindful of him the son of
[6:00] man that thou visiteth him
[6:03] Lord I just right now God surrender my
[6:05] vessel Lord the words that I've have
[6:08] upon my heart the thoughts Lord Jesus
[6:12] father and I come subservient now Lord
[6:14] to your spirit believing Lord that it's
[6:18] in this place
[6:19] Lord a place father that's been
[6:21] energized by singing and by Worship in
[6:24] my father a spirit of Faith Lord that is
[6:27] in this building
[6:28] God I pray Lord that you would come down
[6:30] reach down lord to every hand that's
[6:33] went up behind those hands Lord is a
[6:35] need that's represented and I pray God
[6:37] that you would come and meet the
[6:38] expectation of that Heart Lord you know
[6:41] what we have need of long before we can
[6:43] even ask and God I didn't even know I
[6:45] would be preaching this here today Lord
[6:48] I'm not prepared for say Lord as I would
[6:51] want to be but I've just obeyed you Lord
[6:53] and I pray God that you would come and
[6:55] use my vessel Lord as I would just open
[6:57] my mouth father I pray that you would
[6:59] use me Lord as a weapon of warfare to
[7:02] tear the devil's Kingdom down
[7:04] may it be Lord granted to each heart
[7:06] each mother and father and young person
[7:08] oh the light Lord that's here Grant it
[7:10] to us now Lord in Jesus Christ's name
[7:12] amen amen you can be seated
[7:23] it's an amazing scripture you read here
[7:25] in judges and we're just going to read
[7:27] just a few uh more portions of scripture
[7:30] here and then come to a thought but I
[7:33] would just like to minister to you here
[7:35] just for a moment on the value of the
[7:38] spirit it's a powerful thing when you
[7:41] think of the life of Samson and you
[7:43] think of the purpose that God had placed
[7:45] in his life even before Samson was born
[7:49] God had already predetermined a purpose
[7:52] in his life and he had already long
[7:54] before he was born God had already had
[7:57] the gifts that he was going to pour in
[8:00] this man's life he comes to his mother
[8:01] and father and he makes them a covenant
[8:04] a promise and says you're going to
[8:06] conceive you know Israel had been in
[8:08] backslidden in sin and the Bible says
[8:11] that they were oppressed by the
[8:12] Philistines but the reason the
[8:14] Philistines were oppressing them is
[8:16] because a lifestyle of running from God
[8:19] and Disobedience to the Lord had brought
[8:21] the Philistines upon their life and now
[8:24] God was going to bring them a savior
[8:27] this is the word that the Bible uses for
[8:29] judges in fact if you read that what the
[8:32] Bible the Jewish Bible That's the word
[8:34] that it uses is that these were judges
[8:36] not in judicial terms of a judge who
[8:38] presides over a case but actually the
[8:41] word is savior that God would begin to
[8:44] save them from their oppressors it's the
[8:47] same word we use from for Jesus is that
[8:49] he would be the Savior but he wasn't
[8:52] just coming to deliver us from
[8:53] oppressors but from sin the real
[8:56] oppressor of humanity but Samson was a
[8:59] savior he was his this was the purpose
[9:02] of his life that God had long before he
[9:05] came to to be and God had already
[9:07] purposed something it already planned it
[9:09] already uh orchestrated or you could say
[9:12] he charted it out from the cradle all
[9:15] the way to the grave and God said I'm
[9:17] going to anoint this man's life I'm
[9:20] gonna I'm gonna have a special purpose
[9:22] for this man's life and I've already got
[9:25] all of the junctures and all of the
[9:27] crossroads and all of the decisions I've
[9:29] already got them all mapped out and you
[9:31] know long before you ever come to a
[9:34] decision God already has a place and has
[9:37] a way for you to take God already has a
[9:41] perfect will and a perfect plan he's not
[9:43] aimlessly in heaven trying to figure
[9:45] your life out and just up there randomly
[9:48] and I wonder what they'll come out to be
[9:50] and I wonder what kind of value I could
[9:52] get out of their life and I I wonder
[9:54] what kind of a purpose I could bring
[9:56] from them but I believe that God puts
[9:58] you in a place specifically in a state
[10:00] in a city and a school and a family and
[10:03] a church and a condition and maybe a
[10:06] hard circumstance that you don't even
[10:08] understand but let me just preach to you
[10:10] for a moment and say you're equipped for
[10:13] the job that God has in your life
[10:15] whether you feel equipped tonight or you
[10:17] feel you don't have the instructions
[10:19] brother Bynum said and why Christ speak
[10:21] God a man God puts in a man the
[10:24] equipment for his life he's born with
[10:27] the equipment already inside of him
[10:31] and so there's nothing that happens in
[10:33] our life that makes God nervous there's
[10:35] nothing that gives him stress or or
[10:37] worry or anxiety he's never
[10:40] second-guessing his purpose that he
[10:42] placed in your life
[10:44] you notice even all the way through
[10:45] Samson's life no matter where he went
[10:47] God never second guess the decision he
[10:50] made to pick Samson he never second
[10:53] guessed the decision to pick David he
[10:55] never when David Fell with Bathsheba at
[10:57] God never second guessed or thought I
[10:59] made a mistake or or there's been some
[11:01] catastrophe that's happening oh I've got
[11:03] to abort my first plan but let me just
[11:05] say this God already gave you the the
[11:09] answer to your problem the solution is
[11:12] already here tonight
[11:15] and he's not out there worried and
[11:17] wondering and stressful and worried
[11:19] about how it's happening I don't care
[11:20] what event you want to give me tonight
[11:22] world events who's in the White House
[11:25] who's going to be in the White House
[11:26] listen it's not Kim Schumann votes or
[11:29] people's votes that puts a leader over a
[11:31] country or over a nation
[11:35] but God said I raise up a nation and I'd
[11:38] bring down a nation I'll raise up a
[11:40] leader and I'll bring down a leader to
[11:41] accomplish his purposes
[11:43] even brother Branham in the message
[11:45] countdown begins to say that even Meta
[11:47] Even science has achieved great
[11:49] achievements but did you know brother
[11:51] random said even the all the
[11:53] achievements man has ever accomplished
[11:55] God was the one who put it in the heart
[11:57] of mankind to accomplish that
[11:59] achievement
[12:01] he takes the horse and buggy and he says
[12:04] it was a great achievement by man now I
[12:06] don't understand how the horse and buggy
[12:08] or I'm sorry not the the the the the the
[12:10] you know the horse and buggy with a
[12:12] buggy with wheels and you say my
[12:14] goodness you know what that's that's a
[12:15] that's an achievement a will is an
[12:17] achievement well to God it was a great
[12:19] achievement
[12:22] that man learns to transport himself and
[12:24] he says then God goes further and and he
[12:26] says and then man discovers the
[12:27] automobile and the combustion engine and
[12:30] he says but notice each time man was
[12:32] achieving something it was only
[12:34] representing that God was wanting to
[12:37] release something to his church and so
[12:40] man would understand combustion engines
[12:43] and man would understand a flight and
[12:46] and travel by air and then they would
[12:48] they would they would understand they
[12:50] would they would discover the astronaut
[12:52] age but brother Branham said all those
[12:54] were measured by something God was doing
[12:56] come on you know the message it was
[12:58] something God was doing in his church
[13:00] that's why the prophet says just about
[13:02] the time the Wright brothers were taking
[13:03] flight and getting up off the ground
[13:05] there was a little group of people in
[13:07] Azusa Street in California that was
[13:10] starting to spiritually come out of this
[13:12] Dimension and move up into the upper
[13:15] atmospheres
[13:16] and so you see nothing happens
[13:19] that takes God off guard
[13:22] my of that Revelation would ever drop
[13:25] into your heart and do you some good
[13:26] here tonight do you realize nothing ever
[13:29] happens nothing ever stresses him out
[13:32] for God actually it's already taken
[13:35] place
[13:36] that from the beginning to the end
[13:38] history is just God's story we break it
[13:42] up and say it's his story that's exactly
[13:44] what it is the prophet of God would call
[13:46] it a drama
[13:47] and so there's actors to that drama
[13:49] there's people that play certain parts
[13:51] to that drama and God already Anointed
[13:54] The Evil and he already anointed evil
[13:56] leaders he anointed Pharaoh he anoints
[13:58] uh evil Nations he anoints Good Men He
[14:00] anoints bad men they're all controlled
[14:03] by his purpose
[14:07] sorry man
[14:08] and so nothing happens for God that
[14:11] takes him off guard it's like watching a
[14:14] rerun
[14:18] it's like watching a rerun for God
[14:21] everything's already taken place the
[14:23] lamb was slain before the foundation of
[14:25] the world that's why God never gets
[14:28] discouraged when you get discouraged
[14:30] that's why God never loses faith when
[14:32] you lose Faith because he already knows
[14:34] in the end it doesn't matter what it
[14:36] looks like right now
[14:37] [Applause]
[14:39] in the end they're going to be an
[14:40] overcomer
[14:41] it's like watching a ball game you ever
[14:43] watched your family been with the person
[14:45] who's watching their favorite team you
[14:47] know and they get so wrapped up into a
[14:49] sport and wrapped up into their you know
[14:51] their Champion whoever it is uh you know
[14:53] whether it's I don't care what sport you
[14:55] like here in football or basketball or
[14:58] no matter what it is and they get so
[15:00] wrapped up in that team or that person
[15:02] or that whoever it is that they're they
[15:04] get so stressed out
[15:06] the further uh Victory and the further
[15:09] that team goes in the tournament the
[15:11] more the stress level goes up and higher
[15:14] if they would have lost in the first
[15:15] round I would be okay
[15:18] but now it's getting closer now we're
[15:20] down to the semifinals and and boy when
[15:23] it comes to the final I don't care
[15:24] what's what what it is man you know some
[15:27] of those people they can't even be in
[15:28] the room to watch the game
[15:32] they're so stressed out the biggest most
[15:34] moments that the most highest you know
[15:37] most what would be the most exciting
[15:39] crescendos
[15:40] and and the most excited moments and
[15:43] they can't even watch it I don't even
[15:44] want to see it just turn it off
[15:47] and they'll walk out of the room I've
[15:49] been with them before I was at a
[15:50] restaurant one time ordering some
[15:51] takeout food and man I walked in that
[15:53] place and it was dead silent I was like
[15:55] what in the world is going on there's
[15:56] there you know I don't know what's
[15:58] happening a restaurant that's usually
[15:59] loud and and you know shaking the walls
[16:01] are usually shaking and it's dead silent
[16:03] and I walk in there and I realize
[16:05] there's TV screens and everybody's just
[16:07] glued to this big college football game
[16:09] I don't even know who it was it was a
[16:11] big championship game and you can just
[16:13] feel the tension and the stress and
[16:15] before you know it people are getting up
[16:17] walking out I don't even want to see it
[16:18] I don't even want to watch it I just
[16:20] walked out of there I thought wait
[16:21] here's your team they've made it to the
[16:22] final moment here's the big game here's
[16:24] the big moments the fourth quarter
[16:26] there's only a minute left and you don't
[16:28] even want to watch it
[16:30] they're under so much stress they're
[16:33] under so much anxiety
[16:35] but you ever watch that same game with
[16:37] the man who's watching the rerun of the
[16:39] game where his team won
[16:43] it's a completely different atmosphere
[16:46] it's a completely different feeling
[16:47] because he already knows what's happened
[16:49] he already knows in the end his team won
[16:53] the game anyways oh friends if you could
[16:56] ever get a revelation of the backside of
[16:58] the book
[16:59] that in the end you've already won your
[17:02] team already won the game that means it
[17:05] doesn't matter when he fumbles the ball
[17:06] it doesn't matter what happens in my
[17:08] life God's put a purpose in my life
[17:11] so it done my present condition doesn't
[17:14] matter
[17:17] because in the end I'm gonna win
[17:20] can you say Amen tonight
[17:24] so Samson's Samson's life is Anointed
[17:28] long before he ever comes mom before he
[17:31] ever breathes his first breath he's
[17:33] already got a perfect course a perfect a
[17:36] perfect uh a charted course that God's
[17:39] already made for him
[17:42] you know life is an amazing thing from
[17:44] the Cradle to the Grave
[17:47] and let me say it this way life is an
[17:49] array of choices
[17:51] you have choices that are large and then
[17:55] you have choices that are smaller
[17:57] and Samson's life was a life that was
[17:59] made up of some big decisions and some
[18:02] very small decisions
[18:05] and ultimately it was Samson's choice
[18:09] on what he valued or what he considered
[18:13] important and that would be what he
[18:15] prioritized in his life you know you
[18:18] will always prioritize what you consider
[18:21] valuable
[18:24] can we be practical here for a moment
[18:27] you will always prioritize or put
[18:30] emphasis on the things that you consider
[18:33] to be valuable to you
[18:36] and you know if a certain person values
[18:38] a certain thing and maybe you don't
[18:40] share that same value it's sort of like
[18:43] art you know I don't I don't value art I
[18:45] don't understand art I guess Modern Art
[18:47] that's when you understand it is when
[18:49] you don't understand it I think brother
[18:51] Paul
[18:52] but I don't I don't understand art but
[18:54] you take a person who understands and
[18:56] they value that and I look at some
[18:58] pieces of artwork and it's shocking that
[19:01] the price and here's people that are
[19:03] bidding it at you know an auction and
[19:06] and the price is going from five to
[19:08] seven to ten thousand dollars and twenty
[19:10] thousand I'm thinking oh it's just a
[19:13] painting that a certain person painted
[19:15] and and it doesn't make sense it's just
[19:17] a blob of of colors and to me it doesn't
[19:20] look like nothing
[19:21] but do you know that a person who values
[19:24] that they can see the value in it and
[19:27] they'll give they'll give money that
[19:29] they'll they'll they'll go on a search
[19:30] they'll they they hold that place in
[19:33] high regard and high esteem because they
[19:35] value it
[19:39] and so Samson's priorities were
[19:42] controlled by his values values are such
[19:45] an important thing in our life
[19:48] and so his life starts out in Judges 13
[19:51] you can read it here and and we're just
[19:54] going to turn if you had your Bible turn
[19:55] there with me and we're just going to
[19:56] read a couple paraphrase a few things
[19:58] but go through this maybe
[20:01] uh
[20:03] uh slowly so let's just read here she
[20:05] conceives and has a son
[20:07] and the woman Bears son and called his
[20:09] name Samson and the child grew and the
[20:10] Lord blessed him and the spirit of the
[20:12] Lord began to move him at times in the
[20:14] camp of Dan between Zora now notice so
[20:17] it's very evident and very clear that
[20:20] there was a season in Samson's life
[20:23] there was a a time frame where the
[20:26] spirit of the Lord was moving upon
[20:28] Samson's heart
[20:30] ever so there was a time in his life
[20:32] where he valued the spirit of God he
[20:35] valued the gift that God had placed in
[20:37] his life and he operated under that
[20:39] anointing that God had placed upon him
[20:42] so we know that they're from the
[20:44] scripture that and the Bible does it and
[20:46] judges it doesn't cover every little
[20:48] detail and we don't really know how many
[20:49] years elapsed unless the Bible tells us
[20:52] that we don't know the time frame of how
[20:54] much time elapsed between chapter 13 and
[20:56] chapter 14. but we do know that there
[20:59] came a point in Samson's life where he's
[21:01] he's making decisions he's making
[21:04] choices and from the time that you're
[21:06] you're very young you begin to make
[21:08] choices in your life and you have
[21:11] responsibilities and and choices are so
[21:14] important
[21:15] so important the choices that we decide
[21:18] the things that we decide every decision
[21:21] and whether it's a large one or a small
[21:24] one ultimately it's every choice in our
[21:28] life
[21:29] that holds a certain consequence
[21:34] and and whether that's a good
[21:36] consequence or a a bad consequence
[21:39] even the things that we listen to and
[21:42] the friends that we choose and the the
[21:45] things that we allow to enter into our
[21:47] homes or into our lives into our minds
[21:50] and the very little things I'm getting
[21:53] down just to the very small things that
[21:55] we choose where we choose to live what
[21:57] church we go to where we choose
[21:59] employment we have to make these
[22:01] decisions
[22:03] what we choose to do with our time
[22:07] you see brother Brandon says God cannot
[22:09] push us through some kind of little pipe
[22:10] and put us on the other end and and then
[22:12] say blessed is he that overcometh
[22:14] brother Adam says what kind of
[22:16] overcoming would that be you didn't
[22:17] overcome anything if it has pushed you
[22:19] through a little pipe on the other side
[22:21] and just pushed you through but the
[22:22] prophet says but you've got to make the
[22:25] decision for yourself
[22:29] you see there there Comes A Time in your
[22:31] life when God is not going to no longer
[22:33] push you he's no longer going to unction
[22:36] you he's no longer going to press you
[22:39] he's going to leave the decision to you
[22:41] to make the choice
[22:44] reminder of brother Brandon's Vision
[22:45] over his life through Danny Henry and
[22:47] the prophecy that's spoken out and it
[22:49] says because you chose the harder way
[22:54] and it was the path of your choosing
[22:57] and he says behold it's my way there's a
[23:01] great portion of Heaven
[23:04] not on Earth
[23:08] because sometimes the choices that we
[23:10] make don't bring Heaven to Earth
[23:13] oftentimes they bring discouragement and
[23:16] Torah and sometimes in our life they
[23:18] bring great adversity
[23:25] and so in the larger Grand picture
[23:29] what we find is after you look and you
[23:31] see a trajectory and you see a graft of
[23:34] the from the beginning to the end and
[23:37] and what you find when you sort of zoom
[23:39] out from the grand picture of life
[23:42] or zoom in you find rather that you see
[23:45] a life that was made up of a choice
[23:47] after Choice after Choice after Choice
[23:49] and then those small choices turn into a
[23:53] pattern
[23:55] and then that pattern leads to a certain
[23:58] trajectory
[23:59] maybe an ebb and flow in a life and
[24:02] ultimately your final destination
[24:06] of where you end up in life
[24:10] or eternity will simply be the result of
[24:14] choices you made
[24:19] and so you can look at your life now and
[24:22] you can understand that you've arrived
[24:25] at the spot where you're at now whether
[24:28] you whether whether you like it or you
[24:30] don't like it whether it's good or bad
[24:32] whether it's peaceful or stressful
[24:35] whether it's joyful or sad you've
[24:38] arrived at the place in your life
[24:41] and you're ultimately your destination
[24:43] and where you've arrived is based upon
[24:45] the choices you've made very natural I'm
[24:48] I'm speaking here for a moment very
[24:51] natural choices I'm not talking about
[24:53] ethereal things and spiritual things
[24:55] even per se but you know sometimes
[24:58] serving the lord is not some great
[25:00] ethereal kind of you know thing
[25:02] that's just you know overflowing all the
[25:05] time with Jitter sometimes serving the
[25:07] lord is a very natural simple it's the
[25:10] very little simple things
[25:12] that you choose to do when you don't
[25:15] want to do it
[25:20] and so Samson learns this as the Bible
[25:23] said God anoints his life now we know
[25:26] that he wasn't filled with the Holy
[25:28] Ghost uh in the sense of how that we're
[25:31] filled but he was filled very much like
[25:32] other men even David in Psalms 51 when
[25:35] he prays I pray that your Holy Spirit
[25:36] not depart from men you have even John
[25:39] who was filled with the holy ghost from
[25:41] uh you know his uh but but the Bible
[25:43] says in John chapter 7 it speaks of the
[25:46] spirit and it says he that believeth
[25:48] after me shall out of his belly flow
[25:51] rivers of Living Water and if you read
[25:53] in your your Bible in parentheses it
[25:55] says but he spoke of the spirit which
[25:58] had not yet been given so we know that
[26:01] the difference between a man like Samson
[26:03] or a man like David or a man like Noah a
[26:06] man like Jonah these men were Anointed
[26:09] with the spirit of God that there was an
[26:12] anointing that came over upon their life
[26:14] this was the Breath of God this is what
[26:17] the word for breath means or spirit
[26:19] means in the the Bible it actually means
[26:22] the the word is ruach which is the wind
[26:25] or the breath and man that God breathed
[26:29] into his nostrils of the breath of life
[26:32] and Man became a living Soul so this was
[26:34] the enabling power it was the enabling
[26:37] force it was the the spirit of God that
[26:41] that was going to enable them to do
[26:43] things that no other man could do or to
[26:46] be things that no other man could be
[26:49] that's what anointed prophets of God it
[26:51] was the very ruach the spirit the breath
[26:54] of the Living God job speaks of it and
[26:56] says the breath the ruach of God is in
[26:59] my nostrils you can you can read this
[27:01] and it goes all the way through the
[27:02] Bible it was it was the life of God or
[27:05] in essence it was the spirit or the
[27:07] anointing of God that was upon Samson
[27:10] you say then what was the difference
[27:11] between Jesus and Samson the difference
[27:13] was is that Samson had just a portion of
[27:17] that of of that Spirit where Jesus was
[27:19] the fullness
[27:21] of the godhead bodily so Jesus was going
[27:25] to be all that Samson and David and
[27:27] Jacob and Joseph and all of the Mighty
[27:30] Men of God he was going to be all of
[27:33] those in one man
[27:35] the Bible would say this way he had the
[27:37] spirit without measure
[27:43] but Samson we know has the spirit of God
[27:45] anointing his life and and so he's he's
[27:49] filled he's filled with the spirit of
[27:52] God from the very from his birth and
[27:55] and it is a very special thing I just
[27:59] saw him obeying the Holy Spirit here
[28:00] tonight and trying to be sensitive to
[28:02] his to the unction of the Holy Ghost let
[28:05] me just say this it's a very special
[28:06] thing when God fills you with the spirit
[28:10] it's a very special thing when God
[28:12] anoints your life
[28:14] and when God anoints the gift that he's
[28:16] placed in you and I don't care what
[28:18] capacity you serve whether it's a mother
[28:21] to a child let me just say that's a gift
[28:23] that God anoints in your life and it's a
[28:26] very powerful thing when God anoints
[28:29] don't take that for granted don't let it
[28:31] become common
[28:34] but it's a very special thing when God
[28:36] anoints Samson's life
[28:39] and then the Bible says he's going to
[28:41] begin to deliver Israel out of the hand
[28:44] of their oppressors
[28:46] and so we know God's people the Bible
[28:48] says we're under oppression and so
[28:50] Samson's going to come there and he's an
[28:52] anointed vessel he's a consecrated
[28:55] vessel
[28:57] this is what the hair the Nazarite vow
[29:00] spoke of that the hair was was would be
[29:03] called the crown of consecration
[29:07] and it was just an outward that what the
[29:10] power was not in necessarily the outward
[29:13] uh external substance or appearance
[29:17] but the outward appearance was only the
[29:21] representation of a heart that was
[29:24] dedicated or consecrated
[29:27] to the Lord
[29:29] that is what anointing is
[29:33] you see an anointing is not just a
[29:36] feeling that comes over your body an
[29:38] anointing actually in the Bible it is
[29:40] the word Schumann and and it's actually
[29:43] simply the very most simple definition
[29:45] of the word anointing is to smear or to
[29:49] rub with oil
[29:51] just what it means to smear or to rub
[29:55] what does it mean when you would anoint
[29:57] a man you were taking anointing oil and
[30:01] you were anointing that man they would
[30:03] take a king who was going to be anointed
[30:04] to lead a nation and a prophet like
[30:07] Samuel would come over David and he
[30:09] would pour that anointing and that
[30:12] anointing would then come from that the
[30:14] promise of that purpose and it would
[30:16] anoint that man's life so you say
[30:18] brother Matt what was the anointing the
[30:20] anointing was simply the transfer of
[30:24] God's purpose to a life
[30:29] let me say that again the anointing and
[30:31] anointing were is just a transfer of a
[30:37] promise of Jesus that's why we pray for
[30:40] you and when the Bible says in the Book
[30:41] of James let them let the Elders of the
[30:43] church they have those that are sick
[30:44] amongst you let them be Anointed with
[30:46] oil what are we doing when we anoint you
[30:48] with oil there's nothing special about
[30:50] the oil there's not so that you can get
[30:52] oily or have oil on your head but we are
[30:55] representing a promise of Jesus and that
[31:00] anointing is to transfer that from the
[31:02] mouth of Jesus to the pages of a Bible
[31:05] to the faith inside your heart and that
[31:07] promise comes into your body
[31:09] [Music]
[31:11] and so do you realize when a man was
[31:13] anointed he was literally baptized
[31:17] with the purpose from Jehovah
[31:22] that's why we sing the song I am not my
[31:24] own I'm bought with the price
[31:26] so God when God anoints a life he's
[31:29] claiming that he's taken his purpose
[31:31] he's taken his his anointing with his
[31:34] which is his purpose and he anoints that
[31:38] man's life
[31:42] and so that that anointing would come
[31:44] over Samson and it was a power it was it
[31:48] was a supernatural a supernatural
[31:52] strength that would come over this man's
[31:55] life that's why it means what it meant
[31:57] when he was born a Nazarite unto God in
[32:01] other words it wasn't going to be a vow
[32:03] that he took as a Nazarite vow but Jesus
[32:06] was born the same way John the Baptist
[32:08] the same they were a Nazarite unto God
[32:11] they were consecrated holy dedicated for
[32:14] the purposes of God in other words you
[32:17] say brother Matt what does that mean it
[32:19] means it's a person who says Lord I am
[32:22] making myself available
[32:24] I am making my body my vessel my mind my
[32:28] mouth my words I want you to know Holy
[32:31] Spirit I'm making myself available
[32:37] and so that that Nazarite was available
[32:39] for God to use
[32:42] oh I just want to say Lord I want to
[32:44] make myself available
[32:46] I want you to know Lord I'm I'm emptying
[32:49] myself
[32:50] and I want to become available to your
[32:52] spirit amen
[32:54] and when you make yourself available to
[32:57] the Holy Ghost you've got to completely
[32:59] let go of all of your preconceived ideas
[33:02] let go of all your Ambitions let go of
[33:05] all of your goals and your dreams and
[33:07] your plans
[33:08] you see when you want to be anointed of
[33:11] God and the spirit of God comes upon
[33:13] your life you've got to be annoying
[33:15] you've got to be available to the Holy
[33:17] Spirit to use
[33:19] and many times your plans and your
[33:21] dreams and your Ambitions conflict with
[33:23] what God is wanting
[33:27] and so God God visits this man and he
[33:30] and he's he has many victories that
[33:33] tonight we can read about
[33:36] and so God is saying to Samson I've laid
[33:39] out to Manoa I've laid out the
[33:42] blueprints
[33:43] for his life even before he was born
[33:46] I've laid out the path of charted the
[33:48] course
[33:50] and it was my plan it was his plan it
[33:52] was his calling it was his anointing
[33:55] that God seen from the beginning
[33:59] all the way to the end
[34:03] and he never lost the vision of that
[34:08] purpose
[34:11] are you hearing me or tonight Church
[34:13] no matter where Samson went
[34:16] God never lost the vision for Samson's
[34:23] and we know the scripture very well and
[34:25] I think it's a Jeremiah 29 and it says
[34:27] for I know the thoughts that thou has
[34:29] that I have for you thoughts of not of
[34:31] evil but thoughts of good and to bring
[34:34] you to and expected end this is where it
[34:38] expected means an anointed or
[34:40] consecrated in or a pre-purpose
[34:42] predestinated plan God is saying I know
[34:45] the thoughts here's the thoughts I've
[34:47] had towards you not of evil but to bring
[34:49] you to an expected end
[34:54] I've got a purpose for your life I've
[34:56] raised rose you up for such a time as
[34:58] this
[35:00] and what the Bible is saying is that God
[35:02] charts the course of every life with
[35:04] specific details purposes instructions
[35:07] and equipment for the job even Pharaoh
[35:11] was raised up for a purpose whether it
[35:13] was evil or whether it was good Judas
[35:15] was raised up for a purpose and let me
[35:17] just preach her and say God's family is
[35:19] raised up for a purpose listen to me
[35:21] Church there are people that fulfill the
[35:23] Church of lady asea that's lukewarm and
[35:25] cold and formal and Powerless and but
[35:28] let me just preach and say that's not
[35:30] your scripture that's not your anointing
[35:33] you are not the code formal Church of
[35:35] the end time we are the Overcomers of
[35:37] ladies here
[35:39] and there is an anointing upon the word
[35:41] of God to bring that to pass in your
[35:43] life
[35:45] and so he purposed it
[35:48] he rose him up for this purpose
[35:51] and anointed him
[35:53] and that was so powerful you would think
[35:57] that just the anointing of Jehovah
[36:00] would be enough
[36:02] for a man's life
[36:04] you would think that the anointing of
[36:06] the Holy Ghost that could take a man and
[36:08] give him some Supernatural strength that
[36:11] would be enough to bring Samson from the
[36:15] cradle all the way to the vision that
[36:17] God had of him surely brother Matt
[36:19] Samson's life was a life that was so
[36:21] anointed
[36:23] that he never deviated from the purpose
[36:26] or plan of God
[36:27] oh no
[36:28] but do you see even with all of that
[36:30] powerful purpose man is still made up of
[36:33] memory conscience reasoning imaginations
[36:35] affections
[36:37] and he has something so powerful that
[36:40] God gave him
[36:41] something called choice
[36:47] the ability to choose for your self
[36:55] to choose to make a decision
[36:58] to decide
[37:02] God gives man free moral agency
[37:07] judges 14 we'll just go through it very
[37:08] quickly and he says and Samson went down
[37:11] to Timnath saw a lot woman and Tim Nath
[37:13] of the daughter of the Philistines and
[37:15] came and told up and told his father
[37:16] mother said I've seen a woman and Tim
[37:17] nothing of the daughter of the
[37:18] Philistines now therefore get her for me
[37:21] to wife boy imagine if your children
[37:23] told you that Mom
[37:26] then his father and his mother said unto
[37:28] him is there never a woman among the
[37:31] daughters of thy Brethren are among all
[37:34] my people that thou goest and take a
[37:36] wife of the uncircumcised Felicity
[37:39] and Samson said unto his father get her
[37:43] for me for she pleasesth me well
[37:51] now I'm going to show you something so
[37:53] powerful
[37:55] because to any
[37:57] believer
[37:58] you would you would you would it would
[38:01] be no different than Manoa you'd be no
[38:04] different than this mother and father
[38:06] and to say I listen son is there not a
[38:09] Believer here's they're not is they're
[38:11] not someone here
[38:13] amongst your own people that you've got
[38:15] to go take a wife of the Philistines
[38:17] listen it was never God's perfect will
[38:19] for Samson to take a wife outside of
[38:22] God's chosen elected People Israel it is
[38:25] never God's perfect will never
[38:31] but notice what the Bible says here in
[38:33] this the Bible says word verse 4 but his
[38:36] father and mother knew not that it was
[38:39] of the Lord
[38:42] so you mean God takes things that makes
[38:44] no sense to us
[38:48] and God says actually I'm using this for
[38:51] a certain purpose in a certain special
[38:52] mission that you have no idea about and
[38:55] if I told you you wouldn't understand it
[38:56] anyway so I'm going to keep it from you
[38:59] why couldn't God have said Manoa down
[39:01] and said no manila listen don't say that
[39:02] it's actually me but God never tells him
[39:05] that he keeps it from him
[39:08] they didn't know it was of the Lord
[39:10] because he sought an occasion upon the
[39:12] Philistines so notice this we know the
[39:14] story that Samson goes down to this
[39:16] woman we know that the chaos that ensues
[39:19] and the collateral damage and there's
[39:20] men that are murdered and the whole
[39:22] house has destroyed him and and and we
[39:25] we can we can move on from that he comes
[39:27] from there and we come to Judges chapter
[39:29] 16. just turn over in your Bible just a
[39:32] couple of scriptures Judges chapter six
[39:34] and I won't belong here tonight then
[39:36] when Samson to Gaza and saw there a
[39:39] harlot and went in unto her and told it
[39:41] was told the Gazette sand Samson has
[39:43] come hither they could passed him and
[39:45] laid weight for him all night in the
[39:46] gate of the city and were quiet all the
[39:48] night saying in the morning when it is
[39:50] day we shall kill him and Samson lay
[39:53] till midnight
[39:55] and arose at midnight and took the doors
[39:58] of the Gate of the sitting the two posts
[40:00] and went with him bar and all and put
[40:02] them upon his shoulders and carried them
[40:04] up to the top of a hill that is before
[40:06] Hebron
[40:07] and it came to pass afterward that he
[40:09] loved a woman in the valley of sorek
[40:11] whose name was Delilah
[40:13] so you notice what you see here from the
[40:15] little preview of The Bible just a
[40:17] little bit of Samson's life you notice
[40:19] this pattern of of making the wrong
[40:21] decision
[40:23] and all the while there's Liars in
[40:26] weight
[40:27] ing to destroy him the whole time
[40:30] even you just read about it there with
[40:32] this woman in Gaza that there's there's
[40:34] liars and weight and they're just
[40:36] waiting for the moment they're waiting
[40:38] for the moment
[40:40] Samson moves on from there he lays to
[40:42] midnight we don't know what went through
[40:44] Samson's mind they're laying on his bed
[40:46] that night could maybe value and start
[40:48] to look at his life and start to take
[40:50] inventory of all of the decisions and
[40:53] all of the harm and all of the chaos
[40:55] that sin had brought him
[40:56] and the Bible says he rose up at
[40:58] midnight and he's good he has a great
[41:01] Victory and there's a great Victory and
[41:03] Triumph and then the spirit of the Lord
[41:05] comes upon him and and he comes from
[41:07] that you know that most dangerous spot
[41:09] you can be in that most dangerous cycle
[41:13] you can be in
[41:17] where the Holy Spirit brings such
[41:19] conviction to your life and he gets your
[41:22] attention and you begin to survey your
[41:24] own life and you repent and you say Lord
[41:25] I'm sorry
[41:27] but the word never really takes real
[41:30] effect down it moves down maybe to the
[41:32] conscience and the memory maybe moves to
[41:34] an emotional realm but it never goes
[41:37] down into that Soul where real Faith or
[41:39] doubt really the real you is down inside
[41:42] of that soul and so you find Samson just
[41:44] coming out of those tears and going
[41:46] right back into the lap of another
[41:48] harlot
[41:50] and he goes on this cycle of sin and
[41:54] repentance and sin and repentance and
[41:56] sin and repentance and sin and
[41:58] repentance
[42:00] just a cycle and a cycle you know it's
[42:02] actually very typified in Samson's life
[42:04] you have on a on a one single man scale
[42:07] of actually a representation of what the
[42:10] entire Book of Judges was
[42:13] it was just a cycle of repentance
[42:16] and sin
[42:18] and repentance and sin
[42:21] Penance and sin
[42:23] and actually if you read the Book of
[42:25] Judges it happens seven times
[42:28] and God would sin to deliver and under
[42:30] that deliverer they would repent and the
[42:33] Bible says it this way all the days the
[42:35] people lived holy unto the Lord all the
[42:38] days of the judge
[42:41] but when the judge died the people went
[42:44] back
[42:45] to the parasites and Hittites and
[42:47] jebusites
[42:49] the Bible would say it that way it would
[42:50] say as long as the as the judge was
[42:53] alive the people served the Lord
[42:56] and as long as he was there notice that
[42:58] you notice what's so important there's
[43:00] certain anchor points in certain
[43:02] people's life and it's amazing sometimes
[43:04] when you dissect and you really pull
[43:06] back the layers of what's really holding
[43:09] people to the truth
[43:11] you want to know where a person's anchor
[43:14] really is start removing some of those
[43:16] anchor points
[43:18] and watch what happens to their life
[43:21] and you watched it over and over again
[43:23] if a Grandpa or Grandma or maybe some
[43:25] Pastor in it the Grandpa's a pastor and
[43:28] they're in church from the time they're
[43:29] young and they're alone you know loving
[43:31] the Lord serving the lord believing the
[43:33] message believing the truth
[43:35] but you know if that person's never
[43:37] anchored if it if his anchor and his
[43:40] faith is resting upon that one single
[43:42] individual then what happens when you
[43:45] uproot and that Grandpa passes away or
[43:47] that church falls away and then you
[43:49] remove that Anchor Point from their life
[43:51] and they become like a boat floating
[43:54] down the tide
[43:57] and that Anchor Point when it's removed
[44:00] from his life from their life when that
[44:02] judge would die it seemed like as long
[44:04] as that judge was there the people
[44:06] served the Lord they came close to the
[44:08] Lord
[44:09] but then that man would die and then the
[44:11] Bible says Israel would slide back down
[44:13] into City and seven times they come to
[44:15] this cycle of death
[44:18] and Samson's life is really just
[44:20] typifying a representative
[44:24] of the condition of God's family
[44:28] and Samson goes and he goes further than
[44:30] that to Delilah
[44:32] and and hear the entire time the parents
[44:34] are there and they're pleading with
[44:36] Samson and and they're they're they're
[44:37] trying to get his attention
[44:39] I don't know why I'm preaching this here
[44:41] tonight and we're so obeying the Lord so
[44:42] just stay with me here I believe it's
[44:44] for somebody maybe someone that's here
[44:45] tonight that won't be here tomorrow I
[44:47] don't know I'll leave that up to the
[44:48] Lord the Lord does this does his job and
[44:50] he does it well
[44:53] and then this mother and father trying
[44:56] so hard to get his attention pastor's
[44:58] trying the deacons are trying the church
[45:00] is trying you know here was the problem
[45:02] with Samson is all Samson's scene was
[45:05] Mom and Dad
[45:08] what he couldn't see was that Mom and
[45:11] Dad were actually vessels of Mercy
[45:15] they were vessels of Mercy they were
[45:18] roadblocks
[45:19] these these were hazard signs that God
[45:22] had put in Samson's life turn around do
[45:25] not enter go the other way and flashing
[45:28] lights to say that you're going the
[45:29] wrong direction do not enter wrong way
[45:33] and he put barricade but all Samson
[45:35] could see was mom that's just mom
[45:37] telling me and that's just that that's
[45:39] just the pastor and he just leans a
[45:41] little bit legalistic and that's the
[45:43] only reason he's even saying those kind
[45:44] of things I got this figured out and I
[45:46] can go my own way and I it's all right
[45:48] it'll all be good
[45:50] and he doesn't realize that those are
[45:52] vessels of Mercy
[45:55] trying to say turn around stop thinking
[45:57] that way bring that thought captive to
[46:00] the Holy Ghost stop thinking your
[46:02] thoughts will eventually develop your
[46:05] habits and your habits will develop your
[46:07] character and your character would
[46:09] determine where you go in life
[46:13] and all they can see was mom and dad you
[46:16] didn't know it was a barricade stop
[46:19] don't enter Road closed
[46:24] you know how many people would get in
[46:26] their vehicle and just go through
[46:27] barricade after barricade after
[46:29] barricade him Road closed and flashing
[46:31] lights and do not enter and you just go
[46:34] barreling through all of those and
[46:35] busting out signs and going down the
[46:37] road who would do that
[46:39] but do you realize this is oftentimes
[46:41] what believers do when God sends warning
[46:44] after warning after warning after
[46:46] warning
[46:47] and we just go through it and through it
[46:49] and through it and through it and
[46:50] through it
[46:55] and his life eventually takes a turn as
[46:57] we know and his eyes are put out
[47:00] and he
[47:02] he's he's blind and he's shaved we we
[47:06] won't cover the whole life of Sampson
[47:08] here tonight I'm preaching to you on the
[47:10] value of the spirit I want you to turn
[47:12] to Genesis chapter 28 if you had your
[47:14] Bible we're just going to look at one
[47:16] more man let's look at Genesis chapter
[47:18] 28.
[47:29] I'm just going to read here starting at
[47:31] verse 13 and behold the Lord stood above
[47:33] it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham
[47:35] my father and of the god of Isaac and
[47:38] the land wherein thou liest to thee will
[47:40] I give it unto thy seed and thy seed
[47:42] shall be as the dust of the earth and
[47:44] thou shalt spread abroad to the West now
[47:46] let's just move on down here to verse
[47:48] 16. uh verse 15. I'm sorry and behold
[47:51] notice this promise of god notice this
[47:53] is powerful and behold I am with thee
[48:01] that's a powerful thing
[48:03] that Jehovah is saying to Jacob behold I
[48:07] am with thee
[48:08] and I will keep thee and all the places
[48:14] the decisions the choices when you need
[48:18] to go right I'm going to tell you to go
[48:19] right when you need to go left I'll tell
[48:21] you to go left when you need to turn
[48:23] around notice Jacob I'm going to be with
[48:25] you at all the Junctions
[48:28] from the days of your adolescence to the
[48:31] days of young married life to the days
[48:33] of odor and your children are teenagers
[48:35] to the time of raising small children to
[48:37] the time of grandparents all the way
[48:39] from the Cradle to the Grave I want you
[48:41] to know my promise Jacob is a covenant I
[48:45] will be with you
[48:47] amen
[48:49] and all the places
[48:52] whether thou go
[48:54] I'm going to stay right
[48:56] beside you
[48:59] and Jacob
[49:02] you're going to go a lot of places the
[49:04] Lord never told you to go
[49:08] you're going to go around a lot of roads
[49:09] that God never told you to go down but I
[49:12] want you to know my promise I'm going to
[49:14] be with you no matter where
[49:17] you go
[49:20] I'll be with you in all the good times
[49:21] all the bad times the times of Sorrow
[49:23] the times I've laughter the times of Joy
[49:25] the times of pain I'm going to be right
[49:28] beside you this is how powerful the
[49:31] promise of God is in your life
[49:37] that no matter where you go I will be
[49:40] with you Jacob
[49:44] and we'll bring you listen to the
[49:46] promise again to this land
[49:48] I will bring you I will bring you for I
[49:52] will not leave thee
[49:56] until I have done that which I have
[50:01] spoken to the of
[50:05] Jacob a woke out of the sleep
[50:07] and he said this is a powerful thing the
[50:10] Bible says and he said surely the Lord
[50:12] is in this place and I knew it not
[50:16] and he anoints a stone and he takes oil
[50:18] and he begins to pour oil over this
[50:21] Stone and he and then Jacob Ray rose up
[50:23] early in the morning the Bible says and
[50:25] he put it had a stone for his pillows
[50:28] and poured oil and he called the name of
[50:29] the place Bethel
[50:32] but the name of the city was called
[50:33] loose so anoints this place this is a
[50:36] place of dedication of consecration it's
[50:39] a very special place in his life
[50:41] so vivid is the dream that Jacob wakes
[50:45] up out of his sleep and and he doesn't
[50:47] know what to do he's just beside himself
[50:49] and he just knows that the Lord had done
[50:51] something so special it takes oil he
[50:53] takes the stone there's nothing special
[50:55] about the stone per se it had been there
[50:57] the night before but now God had visited
[51:00] this place and now to that place he
[51:02] dedicates it he memorializes it
[51:06] you say oh you're just being emotional
[51:08] Jacob you're just getting all worked up
[51:09] listen to me later on in your Bible
[51:11] you'll read that God points back at this
[51:13] Stone and noticed what Jacob did to that
[51:16] stone when he anointed it with oil you
[51:18] think God doesn't see when you take a
[51:19] stand and make a move for God you think
[51:21] the Holy Spirit doesn't recognize that
[51:24] and Mark that down in your life
[51:28] and Jacob wakes up he anoints the Sony
[51:31] calls this name of this place Bethel and
[51:33] he says this is something special it's a
[51:36] special place it's a special Memorial no
[51:39] the stone could serve could it could
[51:41] have that anointing or that place or
[51:42] that atmosphere it was something
[51:44] remarkable to Jacob
[51:47] you know why because it was a reminder
[51:49] of something that he valued
[51:54] it was a reminder it was valuable to him
[51:57] that the Holy Spirit
[51:59] had had moved upon him and so he pours
[52:02] this oil
[52:03] and he says I'm going to serve you Lord
[52:05] I'm going to go from this moment and
[52:06] from this day Lord I'm going to serve
[52:09] you I'm going to walk with you and God
[52:11] you can say at this point had anointed
[52:13] his life
[52:15] but I want you to consider something
[52:16] though anointed though a vision though a
[52:20] purpose though a though a mighty
[52:21] experience
[52:23] that this man Jacob had
[52:26] the same man
[52:28] takes his family all of his children
[52:32] and he brings them to Rock Bottom
[52:37] complete shambles and chaos
[52:42] say how would a man under such an
[52:45] anointing under such a power of God and
[52:49] here God Appears to him at Bethel
[52:52] and he appears supernaturally in a dream
[52:54] and he sees a ladder reaching from
[52:56] Heaven to Earth and angels of sinning
[52:58] and descending him sees the Lord and the
[53:00] Lord speaks and says I'm With You Jacob
[53:03] I'm with you in all the places you go
[53:06] and I'll bring you again to this land
[53:07] that I've promised
[53:09] I'll again bring it to I'll bring you to
[53:11] this place and so God you know you
[53:14] notice what God was doing God was
[53:17] joining himself to Jacob
[53:20] he was attaching his promise
[53:22] unconditionally
[53:25] over his life
[53:27] he was adjoining listen you think God
[53:29] didn't know what Jacob was going to do
[53:31] you think God didn't know where Jacob
[53:33] was going to go you think God didn't
[53:35] know the mistakes that this man would
[53:37] made no God knew every single one of
[53:38] them but let me say his promise was
[53:41] greater than all of his mistakes his
[53:44] promise was greater than all of his
[53:46] difficulties I said his promise that he
[53:48] placed over his life it wasn't going to
[53:51] matter where Jacob went
[53:53] God said I'll bring you back to the
[53:56] place
[53:57] that I promised
[54:00] I know that's so simple but I think it's
[54:02] so powerful
[54:04] I will bring you back here I'm joining
[54:07] myself to you Jacob
[54:11] Jacob wakes up surely the Lord is in
[54:13] this place I knew it not
[54:15] how awesome is this place this is none
[54:17] other than the house of God and this is
[54:20] the Gate of Heaven
[54:23] and then we go from that moment he makes
[54:26] a decision I'll follow the lord we go
[54:30] from that moment and that experience
[54:33] and we go 20 long
[54:36] years
[54:38] time elapses
[54:41] elapses
[54:43] so fast
[54:46] time just goes by like that
[54:49] and they're this big and you're that
[54:51] small and then suddenly they're this
[54:53] pick
[54:54] and overnight it just seems how where
[54:57] did time go what happened
[55:00] but all through all of that all of those
[55:02] years and all of those months down to
[55:03] the weeks down to the days down to the
[55:05] hours down to the minutes there was a
[55:07] choice and a decision and a choice and a
[55:09] decision and things in life were
[55:11] becoming valuable
[55:13] and things in life were losing value
[55:16] and things were becoming more important
[55:19] than other things
[55:23] 20 long years
[55:25] of trial and years of sorrow years of
[55:29] grief and years of trouble you say where
[55:31] was God through all of those years
[55:32] brother Matt that Jacob was backslidden
[55:34] and through all of those years that it
[55:36] seemed like Jacob just was completely
[55:38] lost where was God right beside him
[55:46] after leaving Bethel Jacob settles down
[55:49] and he's forgotten completely the glory
[55:51] of this first experience with the Lord
[55:54] he'd become cold and backslitting and
[55:57] carnal and lustful and and so God in
[56:00] Genesis 31 notice this in Genesis 31 if
[56:03] you have your Bible just follow closely
[56:05] with me Genesis chapter 31 I'll give you
[56:08] just a minute for those that are using a
[56:10] Bible to give you just a minute to get
[56:11] to that in Genesis 31 it's powerful if
[56:14] you read it Genesis chapter 31 and
[56:17] notice here what God says to Jacob and
[56:20] and God says here in verse 13. now this
[56:22] is after all of the years 20 long years
[56:26] and here God comes to Jacob and he says
[56:29] I am the god of Bethel
[56:34] I am the god of Bethel but you're not in
[56:37] Bethel Lord he's not in Bethel he long
[56:40] ago long time before had left Bethel
[56:43] he's miles away from that experience but
[56:46] notice God never would identify himself
[56:49] with Jacob's life out of the will of God
[56:52] God can say I am not the god of your sin
[56:56] I am not the god of your backsliding I
[56:59] am the god of Bethel
[57:03] where thou anointest aha so God seem
[57:07] where thou anoint is the pillar where
[57:09] thou vow to vow unto me
[57:12] now arise
[57:14] get thee out from this land and return
[57:17] into the land of thy kindred
[57:20] what do you got to do Jacob get up
[57:23] go back come back to the word Jacob you
[57:27] don't need to make a big deal out of it
[57:28] don't make a big fuss out of it don't
[57:30] let the devil complicate it and make it
[57:32] so yeah complicated all you got to do is
[57:35] turn around and go the other way give
[57:37] back to the word of God Jacob go back to
[57:40] Bethel
[57:43] get up go back
[57:46] in other words Jacob remember you
[57:48] anointed a stone that was a special
[57:51] experience remember how I moved upon you
[57:54] remember how I spoke to you remember
[57:56] that moment don't forget it lest you
[57:58] forget how many times do you see that in
[58:00] the Bible that the children of Israel
[58:03] forget the ways of the Lord and God
[58:05] would call their mind back to remember
[58:06] and say say remember
[58:10] memories a powerful thing you'll either
[58:12] the devil either use it to destroy you
[58:14] or God will use it to reignite your
[58:17] faith
[58:19] remember remember Jacob remember where
[58:23] you came from that's what brother random
[58:26] says in the Ephesian Church age and he
[58:28] talks about that Ephesian church that
[58:29] had left their first love and brother
[58:31] Brandon says evidently something had
[58:34] left their minds
[58:35] they had forgotten the glory and The
[58:38] Wonder of their message
[58:42] remember Jacob go back get up remember
[58:47] all of your promises
[58:51] remember all of your vows
[58:54] that you vowed to me
[58:56] go back to the altar go back to Bethel
[59:00] Jacob there's no power in this there's
[59:03] no victory in this nothing can happen
[59:06] until you come back
[59:10] I want you to notice that powerful
[59:13] principle God will never do anything in
[59:15] your life while you're outside living
[59:18] outside of the will of God outside him
[59:22] backslid and outside of the glory of God
[59:24] God can never operate until you're
[59:27] willing to come back first
[59:33] you say then surely surely brother Matt
[59:35] Genesis 31 we're going to read
[59:38] the next verse chapter 34 and it's going
[59:41] to say Jacob packed up his family got
[59:43] his camels loaded him up and he went
[59:45] back to Bethel
[59:47] no I wish I could read that but that's
[59:49] not what it says
[59:51] instead Jacob in Genesis 33 settles down
[59:54] and shechem
[59:56] and shechem the word in Hebrew you know
[59:59] what it means it means two things going
[1:00:02] back not back to Bethel
[1:00:05] for backsliding
[1:00:07] that's what Beth that's what shechem
[1:00:09] means and it means a place
[1:00:11] of burdens
[1:00:14] do you want to know
[1:00:16] what it means
[1:00:19] when you're disobedient to the Lord
[1:00:21] and you disobey the Lord and you go
[1:00:23] somewhere he told you not to go
[1:00:26] do you know what you want to know what
[1:00:27] place we come to we come to the place of
[1:00:30] Burden
[1:00:32] and we lose blessing
[1:00:35] and we get burdened
[1:00:37] you know there's a powerful thing when
[1:00:39] you live under the blessing of God so
[1:00:42] powerful that you know when it's gone
[1:00:46] hello
[1:00:48] so powerful that you know when the
[1:00:51] blessing of God is gone
[1:00:54] and Jacob didn't have to look he could
[1:00:56] kid himself but he knew that something
[1:00:58] was gone something was missing and in
[1:01:01] shechem we know the trouble he gets into
[1:01:03] and his house is Dishonored his
[1:01:06] daughters raped and and the the the the
[1:01:08] brothers come and and there's murder in
[1:01:11] there there's just complete chaos
[1:01:14] and then God it just it becomes a place
[1:01:17] for Jacob because of the choices he
[1:01:19] makes becomes such a place of Burden for
[1:01:22] Jacob
[1:01:25] and yet do you know that not one time
[1:01:28] did he relate his trouble to being out
[1:01:31] of God's will
[1:01:33] to be in a place of of of Burden because
[1:01:37] he had disobeyed the Lord no he's very
[1:01:40] much like me
[1:01:42] very much like you the last person that
[1:01:45] we turn to the last thing we do is to
[1:01:49] look introspectively at our own life
[1:01:52] and the first thing we do is blame the
[1:01:54] pastor blame mombling Dad blame this
[1:01:57] thing that happened in her life the last
[1:01:59] thing we do is turn the light down on
[1:02:01] our soul
[1:02:03] and say maybe maybe I need to consider
[1:02:06] my ways
[1:02:13] and he blames could blame everything in
[1:02:15] life
[1:02:17] and God comes to Jacob I want you to
[1:02:19] notice this
[1:02:21] let me just say this here for a moment
[1:02:23] had I been God
[1:02:25] because I won't put you there you may
[1:02:27] not like it I'll just put myself there
[1:02:28] had I been God I can promise you when I
[1:02:31] came back after all of the times I've
[1:02:33] tried all the trouble I've went through
[1:02:35] after all of the times I've tried to get
[1:02:37] his attention after all the times I've
[1:02:39] given him mercy and give it him Grace
[1:02:40] man I would have wanted to give Jacob a
[1:02:43] real lick and a real talking to
[1:02:45] to say my goodness Jacob What's it gonna

[1:03:39] never spoken those words to me he's
[1:03:42] never given up on me he's never lost
[1:03:45] faith in me in fact quite the opposite
[1:03:47] it seems the more I fell him the more
[1:03:50] mercy and Grace that I receive that's
[1:03:53] why their song says it's a Amazing Grace
[1:03:55] you say amazing brother Matt more

[1:04:07] but he continues to move he continues to
[1:04:10] speak he continues to preach he

[1:04:42] God says get it through your head I'm
[1:04:44] never going to give up on you
[1:04:47] I'm going to keep pushing and praying
[1:04:50] and pressing until you believe

[1:05:00] I'm never gonna give up I'm never gonna
[1:05:03] walk away
[1:05:04] I'm never gonna call it quits
[1:05:10] I'm so glad that's the Jesus I serve
[1:05:15] God instead of chastising him in Genesis
[1:05:19] 33 Genesis sorry 35. instead of
[1:05:23] chastising him look at the words
[1:05:26] of Jehovah to disobedient servant
[1:05:31] whose life
[1:05:32] was a mess
[1:05:34] God speaks to this man in Genesis 35.
[1:05:38] very first verse God said unto Jacob
[1:05:43] arise
[1:05:46] arise
[1:05:49] hold on God no no no no no no you must
[1:05:52] have not seen what I see
[1:05:54] are you surely you've got to address
[1:05:55] that you got to you got to say something
[1:05:58] about that Lord surely you're not just
[1:06:00] going to skip over all of it surely Lord
[1:06:02] Lord you've got to bring it up you got
[1:06:03] to say something no God never even makes
[1:06:05] a mention
[1:06:08] he just simply gives him the same word
[1:06:11] he's always gave him
[1:06:14] did you hear me he gives him the same
[1:06:16] word that he's always gave him
[1:06:19] he preaches the same message that he's
[1:06:21] always preached to him he gives him the
[1:06:24] same words that he's already gave listen
[1:06:26] God's word never changes it's still the
[1:06:29] same message it's still the same power
[1:06:31] it's still the same anointing arise
[1:06:33] Jacob go up to Bethel
[1:06:37] I'm going to say the same thing I've
[1:06:39] told you from the very first time you
[1:06:40] made a mistake
[1:06:47] 12 hair and make their an altar unto God
[1:06:53] that appeared unto thee when thou fledst
[1:06:56] from the face of Esau thy brother
[1:07:00] get up Jacob get up Jacob
[1:07:04] how am I gonna figure all this out what
[1:07:06] am I going to do Lord I've came to such
[1:07:07] a place of failure what have I got to do
[1:07:10] Lord to get back just get up child
[1:07:15] that's all you gotta do get up child
[1:07:20] sometimes we get in a rut in our life
[1:07:22] and that rut lasts for years and it
[1:07:24] might have started to something in her
[1:07:26] life that something happened and then
[1:07:28] you get bitter in your heart or you
[1:07:30] maybe someone hurts your do you get a
[1:07:32] pain or a hurt from something or
[1:07:33] somebody or some circumstance and then
[1:07:35] you begin to get distant then years go
[1:07:37] upon years and you forget even the
[1:07:39] reason why you're why you why you feel
[1:07:41] the apathy that you feel you can't even
[1:07:43] explain you're just in a Rutter and the
[1:07:46] devil just pours on and makes it more
[1:07:48] difficult and more complicated almost to
[1:07:50] a Chasm that you you can't even cross
[1:07:52] them it just is impossible for you to to
[1:07:55] get back to God let me just give you the
[1:07:56] simple message of of the Holy Spirit
[1:07:59] here tonight you don't have to do
[1:08:01] anything except get up on your feet and
[1:08:04] say God I'm coming back to the altar I'm
[1:08:07] coming back to Bethel I'm coming back to
[1:08:09] dedication
[1:08:14] all you got to do is come back
[1:08:19] like the little woman in the prayer line
[1:08:21] who comes up to brother Brandon is so
[1:08:22] frantic and worried about her life you
[1:08:24] know brother Brandon I've made so many
[1:08:26] mistakes and I'm so disa sister brother
[1:08:28] Brandon just begins to discern her heart
[1:08:30] he says you you want to get back to the
[1:08:31] Lord you want to get right with the lord
[1:08:33] it's not yes brother yes I just want to
[1:08:35] get back and just so worked up and
[1:08:37] brother Brandon says you're back
[1:08:41] notice just like that there's no there's
[1:08:43] no great there's no great kind of egg a
[1:08:45] thing that she has to go through you've
[1:08:47] got a desire to get back with God God
[1:08:49] never left you you might have left him
[1:08:51] you might have walked away but God
[1:08:53] stayed right beside you he was there
[1:08:55] through every decision through every
[1:08:57] Crossroad their every Junction
[1:09:01] you want to get back with God you're
[1:09:02] back right now
[1:09:07] rise Jacob
[1:09:09] come back
[1:09:15] you know what Jacob did that time
[1:09:18] he gathers up all his idols
[1:09:22] all of his family
[1:09:24] he gets where he takes all of his idols
[1:09:26] and he casts them the Bible says gets
[1:09:27] rid of all of them it cleans everything
[1:09:29] he cleans his entire house Jacob said
[1:09:32] unto his household and all that were
[1:09:34] with him put away the strange gods that
[1:09:36] are among you and be clean and change
[1:09:39] your garments
[1:09:41] God can do something so powerful with
[1:09:44] just simple repentance with just simple
[1:09:46] a real genuine true repentance to say
[1:09:50] God I Repent of my thinking I Repent of
[1:09:53] the ways I've thought before I Repent of
[1:09:55] yesterday I want to be new I want Mercy
[1:09:58] to be new to my whole family what have I
[1:10:00] got to do brother Matt cast out all of
[1:10:02] your Idols throw away all of your gar
[1:10:04] all of your dirty garments and repent
[1:10:06] unto God and come back to the Bethel
[1:10:08] come back to the altar
[1:10:13] doesn't have to be complicated
[1:10:15] only we make it complicated
[1:10:18] we allow the devil to distort and twist
[1:10:20] our mind and bring so much guilt and so
[1:10:23] much condemnation listen God never
[1:10:25] condemns you he might bring conviction
[1:10:27] on your life but he's never there
[1:10:28] condemning you and mocking your life
[1:10:30] he's always there wanting you to come
[1:10:33] back
[1:10:37] and Jacob throws it all away
[1:10:39] all of his ideas
[1:10:42] you know what that's really what real
[1:10:44] repentance really is
[1:10:47] repentance is not a prayer that you pray
[1:10:49] did you know that
[1:10:51] repentance is not a prayer
[1:10:54] come on
[1:10:55] repentance is not words that you do so
[1:10:58] many people think they've repented
[1:11:00] you know like like the man at the bull
[1:11:02] of Bethesda who had been there 38 years
[1:11:04] 37 years an invalid and he's laying
[1:11:07] there at the pool of Bethesda and the
[1:11:10] Bible says that Jesus compasses
[1:11:12] everybody as brother Adam takes us so
[1:11:14] beautifully passes everybody in that
[1:11:16] crowd and comes to this one man who had
[1:11:18] a need
[1:11:19] and he's laying there 37 years you know
[1:11:21] you say brother man that's so
[1:11:23] unfortunate this man was there for third
[1:11:24] 38 whatever it was 38 years uh they're
[1:11:28] they're in the pool of Bethesda and he's
[1:11:29] laying there on a mat and he can't walk
[1:11:31] he can't get up he has no man to pick
[1:11:32] him up and put him in the water and you
[1:11:34] know what's so what's so amazing you say
[1:11:36] that's so pitiful that that happened
[1:11:38] what bad circumstances and Miss sure no
[1:11:40] no no after Jesus heals this man he says
[1:11:42] now go and sin no more so what does it
[1:11:46] tell you what put this man in this
[1:11:48] condition sin
[1:11:50] because sin is destructive to your body
[1:11:53] your mind and your soul
[1:11:56] it doesn't just destroy your soul it
[1:11:58] destroys your mind and destroys your
[1:12:00] spirit it'll make you someone you never
[1:12:03] wanted to become
[1:12:06] and he's laying there 30 some odd years
[1:12:08] an invalid can't get up Jesus comes to
[1:12:11] him and Jesus asks him a very the man
[1:12:14] gives his story you know every time I I
[1:12:18] I you know I've come yeah there's the
[1:12:19] Jesus walks up to him and he just ask
[1:12:22] him a simple question
[1:12:24] will thou be made whole
[1:12:29] very simple just cuts right to the chase
[1:12:33] in other words this is the question do
[1:12:35] you want to be
[1:12:37] made home
[1:12:40] and the man responds and says well every
[1:12:42] year and the angel of the Lord comes to
[1:12:44] stir the waters and I have no man to
[1:12:47] pick me up and put me in the water and
[1:12:48] people get enough ahead of me and in
[1:12:50] front of me and I could never get in
[1:12:52] there and he gives this entire story
[1:12:53] this long story of all of us and Jesus
[1:12:56] just you know what Jesus never responds
[1:12:58] go read your Bible he never replies to
[1:13:01] the man's long sob story
[1:13:03] he just simply asks the same question
[1:13:06] again
[1:13:08] will you be made whole
[1:13:13] amen you say why brother Matt you see so
[1:13:16] many people hate the consequences of sin
[1:13:20] the drunk the alcoholic loves his
[1:13:23] alcohol but he hates that it joins his
[1:13:26] marriage it ruins his job he loses his
[1:13:29] license he drives a moped no one likes
[1:13:32] to drive a moped nobody and an alcohol
[1:13:35] they hate what they hate what the the
[1:13:37] the torment that sin brings to their
[1:13:39] life
[1:13:41] that drug addict he loves the drugs but
[1:13:43] he hates what drugs does to him
[1:13:48] you notice there's a very big difference
[1:13:51] between hating the consequence of sin
[1:13:54] and hating the sin
[1:13:58] and true repentance is not notice Jesus
[1:14:01] never said hey bud man does your back
[1:14:04] hurt
[1:14:06] I can imagine laying there you know
[1:14:08] buddy I mean goodness gracious you got
[1:14:10] to be in a lot of pain yeah I'm in so
[1:14:13] much pain I mean goodness I can imagine
[1:14:15] you got bed sores although oh buddy I
[1:14:17] feel so sharp notice Jesus never asks
[1:14:19] any of that
[1:14:21] you know that alcohol really ruins your
[1:14:23] life that's so terrible and really you
[1:14:25] hate that yeah I hate I hate what it's
[1:14:26] done to me listen everybody hates the
[1:14:29] consequence of sin
[1:14:31] but Jesus wasn't asking him do you want
[1:14:34] to be free of all the trouble that the
[1:14:36] sin has caused you he asked a very
[1:14:38] simple question do you want to be free
[1:14:40] from the sin and there's a big
[1:14:43] difference in wanting the symptoms and
[1:14:45] saying God I I don't just hate the
[1:14:47] trouble I want to be clean from the sin
[1:14:50] I want the addiction I'm on my mind to
[1:14:52] be pure my body to be holy
[1:14:56] I want to be this is what real
[1:14:58] repentance is
[1:15:00] when you hate
[1:15:02] sin and you say I desire Holiness a
[1:15:07] hunger for righteousness
[1:15:09] I want the Holy Ghost not because I'm
[1:15:11] tired of all the trouble in the world
[1:15:13] but because I want the righteousness of
[1:15:15] God to clothe and robe me and take my
[1:15:18] filthiness away take my take all of my
[1:15:21] dirtiness away from my mind from my
[1:15:24] mouth from my thoughts I want to be
[1:15:25] clean
[1:15:30] you ever get that way
[1:15:32] to where you just don't like you
[1:15:38] can we be honest here tonight
[1:15:40] you ever get to the place to where you
[1:15:41] look in the mirror and you say I had
[1:15:43] sometimes I just hate myself I hate who
[1:15:45] I hate who I can become I hate when I
[1:15:48] have a temper I hate when I'm angry I
[1:15:49] hate when I get a bitterness or jealous
[1:15:51] here you say what is that that's the
[1:15:54] Holy Ghost Inside of You
[1:15:58] and so Jacob says I want to throw it all
[1:16:00] away
[1:16:01] the Bible says he takes us everything
[1:16:05] and he gathers his family
[1:16:07] and he goes back
[1:16:09] to Bethel
[1:16:15] and you know what happens at Bethel
[1:16:18] Jacob's restored
[1:16:21] chicken's healed
[1:16:23] Jacob's made whole
[1:16:27] and he washes away
[1:16:30] something so powerful about repentance
[1:16:32] it washes away all of the past
[1:16:36] all of the stress all of the trouble all
[1:16:39] of the guilt all of everything behind
[1:16:41] you you leave it all behind you and
[1:16:44] Jacob washes it all away
[1:16:49] and he comes back to that place
[1:16:55] God says very powerful scripture
[1:16:59] and I'm just going to close right here
[1:17:01] just as maybe the musicians could come
[1:17:03] we're going to close it's eight o'clock
[1:17:06] something so powerful
[1:17:09] in the book of Isaiah
[1:17:12] notice what he says here
[1:17:14] can a woman
[1:17:17] forget her suckling child
[1:17:20] that she should not have compassion on
[1:17:22] the son of her womb
[1:17:24] yes
[1:17:27] they may forget
[1:17:29] yet I
[1:17:31] do not forget
[1:17:35] behold I have Graven thee
[1:17:38] upon the palms of my hands
[1:17:43] and thy walls are continually
[1:17:47] before me
[1:17:49] this word for walls when he says thy
[1:17:52] walls are continually before me is the
[1:17:55] word Shoma
[1:17:57] which literally means to be joined to a
[1:18:00] wall it's the same as a brick mason who
[1:18:03] would lay a brick to another brick and
[1:18:05] it takes mortar he lays the brick to
[1:18:08] another brick and he's joined and it
[1:18:10] becomes one whole wall do you know this
[1:18:12] is what the promise of God that God
[1:18:14] makes in Isaiah and he says can a woman
[1:18:17] forget yea they may forget but I can't
[1:18:20] forget you you say how Lord why can't
[1:18:22] you forgive me because you've got to
[1:18:24] understand child I've joined myself to
[1:18:28] you
[1:18:29] I'm part of you I've interlaced
[1:18:33] when you're in prison I'm in prison
[1:18:36] in other words when you when you when
[1:18:39] you when you're crying I'm crying when
[1:18:41] you hurt I hurt let me give you the New
[1:18:43] Testament language he's a high priest
[1:18:46] who can be touched by the feelings of
[1:18:50] your infirmities
[1:18:52] I want you to stand to your feet tonight
[1:18:54] and I want you to raise a hand and say
[1:18:55] Lord God would you be touched could you
[1:18:58] buy your head with me and raise those
[1:18:59] hands and say Lord would you be touched
[1:19:02] by the filling
[1:19:04] of my infirmity here tonight
[1:19:08] you know he's a high priest
[1:19:10] who can be touched
[1:19:13] and maybe you're here tonight
[1:19:16] you've heard this sermon that the Lord
[1:19:18] just
[1:19:20] I believe gave for somebody here
[1:19:31] and I preached to you on the value
[1:19:34] of the spirit
[1:19:36] maybe you came to a place and you're
[1:19:40] here tonight and you say Lord I I can
[1:19:43] take inventory
[1:19:44] here under this little simple sermon
[1:19:48] and say Lord I've realized
[1:19:50] I've not always valued
[1:19:52] the right things in my life
[1:19:55] I've not always put enough value and
[1:19:58] I've allowed maybe the devil or maybe
