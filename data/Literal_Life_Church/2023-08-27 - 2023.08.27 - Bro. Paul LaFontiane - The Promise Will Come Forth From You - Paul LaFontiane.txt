gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you Lord that you're able to turn on the light Lord as we reach to you Lord Jesus for each of these requests Lord Jesus we've put names to him Lord you know who each and every one of them is Lord Lord we know that you went to the Cross you paid the price Your Love projected to us Lord when you decide that you would die for us we honor that today Lord Jesus in every day of our life Lord but we just lay these requests on our hearts and read before us Lord before you Lord Jesus because you can take care of these things and Lord we want to set them aside and just put them to you Lord let you take care of that that we may step aside now and listen to your Eternal Word Lord Jesus sometimes these thoughts bog us down lord and it's hard to pay

within so glad to your grace Lord God's Grace Grace that is greater than all are sin amen how many would raise your hand and say you know the grace of God unmerited favor amen amen we heard about that last Sunday such a wonderful message that uh we heard from brother Chris and very powerful very uh spoke to me quite a bit and I'll thank all of us the levels of forgiveness that he delved into if you haven't heard that message you should listen to last Sunday it's just such a wonderful challenge to us all from the word of God I just still I listened to it again yesterday and I just was very awed by how deep this forgiveness and grace of God goes and it's got to trickle down into our lives as well towards one another praise the Lord just wanted to make a few nonsense I wanted to say first before the announcements uh sister Kelly I really enjoyed that I was surprised all of us hearing her sing it's like wow but that really ministered we really appreciate it very much it's a great song and it's perfect for the Lord's supper tonight as well that's how deep that this Calvary calvary's blood goes for every experience in life whatever is the deepest wrong that somebody has been done calvary's calvary's love will reach to it can you say Amen praise the Lord there's a concert this Friday in the youth Hall back there in front on Friday if you want to attend that this is a fellow that sings uh religion isn't working anymore I've sung that people thought I wrote it but I didn't write it and he's coming in to sing a few of those songs and I'm sure you'll enjoy him Joseph uh haberdank back in the youth Hall we're going to start usually in the fall I start some in between classes and we did some last fall as the kids go to school that I like to go to school too so I start setting up some different subjects to talk about particularly to the men but also we'll be doing some other ones through the winter here so on the Thursday nights and the Friday nights excuse me the Thursday nights in September and in October we'll be going through the men's bible study courageous and working through that and has some really good things in it scriptural things and Powerful things for True God Godly men and so we'll be studying that together those who want to come are welcome to come and having you set a time yet I suppose Boaz or someone can help me with is at seven do we set a time somewhere around seven o'clock if we need to make at 7 30 to make it easier on Brothers to come after work we will do that but we're going to be going through that the month of September and October on Thursday nights courageous Bible study for men amen if you'd stand let's go to Genesis chapter 15 Genesis chapter 15. reading in the Blessed word of God in Genesis chapter 15 if you would read with me after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward and Abraham said Lord God What wilt thou give me seeing I go childless and the steward of my house is this aleiser of dismascus and Abram said behold to me thou Hast given no seed and lo one born in mine house is mine air so he's pointing to a leiser I've got servants here I've got a great servant a loser of others but I have no heir of my own and remember he's kind of reminding god of the promise that he would have a son himself I don't know why you have to remind God of his promise because he remembers his promise it just hasn't happened yet but he's kind of wondering what's going on here and and so maybe pointing a little bit to is my servant I don't have an heir he's asking the question this is how God answers them and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this a loser and these others this shall not be thine air but he that shall come forth out of thine own bows shall be thy near he had to remind him the promise said it would come from you not through someone else and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the Stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be talking about blowing your mind God likes to blow our minds you want to see your future you want to see how far my promise can go look to the stars and try to count them and that's how your seed will be and he believed in the Lord and he counted it God counted it to him for righteousness he believed it and God said you're righteous before me because he believed and he said unto him I am the Lord that brought thee out of the UR of Charities to give me this land to inherit it and he said Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it and he said unto him take me a heifer of three years old and a shego of three years old and a ram of three years old and a turtle dove and a young pigeon and he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst and laid each piece one against another but the birds divided he not he laid out the perfect pure sacrifice of worship because altar has to do with worship the right sacrifices on the worship that God has asked for now he's getting ready to worship and ask God to answer by fire the sacrifice is perfect next first look at this and when the fouls came down upon the carcasses Abram drove them away he actually had to keep chewing the wrong thing getting on the sacrifice and I just got to believe that the sons of Abram have to do the same thing amen father bless your word today I humbly tell you Lord and I mean this as I tell you often I don't know why you called me for this I feel unqualified many times Lord but I know your word is true I know you put a gift in me and I know I'm speaking to Believers in seed of God seeds of Abraham Lord I know I'm speaking to them that your word will not return void and it'll have its place in the people's lives that's what we're doing here this morning and I pray father that every wrong would be made right every question would be answered everything Lord that we don't have in our own strength that your strength would come from the word of God Lord that you'll keep our spirit right in a receptive Spirit not only today in the service but for the Lord's supper tonight we pray father you'll clean our hearts and make us one with you and we ask it in Jesus name amen God bless you may be seated whenever we explore Abraham's life we find a wealth of riches and Revelation because Abraham's life and what happened to him is related to us because we are the children of Abraham not only uh the the Jews are children of Abraham naturally but we are the children of Abraham spiritually how many believe that you're a a son of Abraham this morning and so now we are his faith children we are actually from the Royal Seed of Abraham because the Royal Faith seed actually was Jesus Christ and so we our lineage is in that we are from the Royal Seed of Abraham coming from Jesus Christ that is our true identity so whenever we look at Abraham's life we say it's so important to us because whatever happened in Abraham happens in The Bride especially at the last days it happens in his seat as well and so we realize that at the beginning of Abraham's life in Genesis chapter 12 is when God called him he said I'm calling you out of your Kindred I'm calling y'all your idolatry and I'm I'm giving you a promise you'll be the father of many nations all that began to happen in Genesis 12 and he did come out he obeyed the call of God he come out from his Kindred left his family left everything and then not only did he leave and act upon that to come out of all that but an unbelievable promise was given to Abraham that he would be the father of many nations because this was unbelievable because he couldn't have children but God took a man that couldn't have children and said you're going to have enough Heritage here and you're going to have heirs and it's going to grow until the stars that are in heaven talk about the god of impossibilities praise the Lord so he got his call in Genesis 12 but what he did not know is how long it would take for the promise to come to pass God did not tell him that but he had the promise he believed the promise but there we know there were times that the promise took so long that it's written in the Bible that that that Abraham and especially his wife Sarah they begin with to have slight doubts about it and they begin to wonder how is this because of the time frames of the promise coming to pass and he had to learn you got to hold on to the promise incidentally in the New Testament none of that weakest is written of it's only the strength of Abraham it's only his positive testimony oh I hope today that's written to me not my mistakes let them be washed in the blood of the Lamb not my thoughts of doubt about things but let it be that I stand in a confession for my heart I believe it with all my heart let that be my testimony but you see now God was had a long time before he brought the promise to be fulfilled even though God was speaking to him along the way and it wasn't every day that he spoke to him but he would speak to him in this he would speak like he did here in a vision he would speak in a dream he would every once in a while reaffirm and revisit Abraham to affirm what the promise to reconfirm the promise and it's a good thing God does that with us every now and then can you say man you may not feel his presence every day but every once in a while in a service or when you're by yourself God comes and his presence comes near and he reaffirms his promise to you Hallelujah because he did it Abraham he'll do it to us that way as well so God is speaking to him different ways not every day but periodic times God would revisit him confirming the same promise it's coming it's coming I said it and then as uh brother Billy Paul used to say he said he said it I believe it and that settles it well that's the way it's got it he said it I believe it and that settles it and we I may not see the full thing yet but it settles it because it settled in My Heart by a revelation how many know that faith is a revelation it's not just intellectually believing it but something dropped in Abraham's heart and he believed it so uh but I wanted to say I find it interesting that this in this chapter he reminds God as if God needs to be reminded that God I have no Heir so now we're in chapter 15. he's come through a different incidence he's delivered a lot and you can just read his story but now in in 15 he's he's coming back to God because the Lord comes to him in a vision and he speaks to God as if God needs a reminder Lord do you remember I have no Heir here I have a servant at leisure and this uh this pressure of waiting till God does it has moved into his thinking the pressure of the long wait before the promise is fulfilled is a pressure if we're going to be honest enough that enters into US sometimes when this when is this thing going to be wrapped up when is the end of his promise when is the final Vindication because I like to say God's Vindicated this word God's Vindicated this message but the final Vindication is still coming because he's going to show the whole world this message was true this was my prophet and he's going to vindicate the whole thing everybody's Gonna Know the devil's going to know can you say man the whole world the Bible says that all every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord they'll have to say this was truth this is what he said but he's going to do that but you see now I find it interesting that he's saying Lord I have no Heir and then in his thinking he gets to the place that you know I'm reminding you that I'm the father of many nations and maybe it's Elisa I got a good servant here uh and then later the next chapter his wife encourages them to go to Hagar and that produces Ishmael and Ishmael is a reflection of the human efforts to try to produce it's a slightly doubted promise and even though something is slightly doubted the promise is slightly doubted and it has fruits like Ishmael that come from it we slightly doubt and we're going to have fruits come from that just a slight doubt makes fruits come from it but God never ever endorsed or blessed the fruit that was produced in a slight doubt foreign he received Ishmael as Abraham's son he received him sent him and his wife laid her away with gifts means that the blessings and and all the stuff that goes around the Holy Ghost move of God can come on anybody can you say Amen but there's a difference in that the seed shall not be aired with the shock that's God's law the seed shall not be aired with the shock and if it's the shock if it's something holding the seed but it's not the seed yet we can't say well we'll just go with the shot no the seed shall not be aired with a shock I told you you would have a son it's going to come for you through your own loins it's going to come out of you you don't choose somebody else like a loser you don't do that you don't doubt it it's got to be believed 100 percent to see the Promise come to pass and I will bring it to pass God says praise be to his name so now Ishmael reflects the human efforts to try to produce the promise with human efforts God has to speak clear to him and this is what I want you to get more than anything this morning God has to remind him but he has to speak something very clear the promise cannot be impersonated the promise cannot be copied the promise can be not worked up or produced in your own strength leave it alone don't mess with it can you say Amen This Promise came from me and the way it's going to come to pass is going to come from me don't try to impersonate it don't try to produce an end smell don't try to work it up come on people don't get nervous about it's not happening it's not happening so try to work something up yourself leave it alone believe with all your heart I will bring this to pass the way that I want to bring it to pass Hallelujah So This Promise cannot be impersonated copied or worked up so I find something out of this this is this this is a devil that you are aware of his work is to try to impersonate the real thing before it comes I mean Say Amen that's the enemy's work to try to impersonate the real thing before it comes is there's a reference to the other prophets calling themselves with the spirit of Elijah other than John the Baptist but John the Baptist was sent from God but there were other men they rose up and they said they got the spirit of Elijah because that was the promise for the hour so Satan's jumping out there and saying I'm Elijah and I'm Elijah even in the last days and under the Pentecostal Azusa Street we had Elijah's right up we still have Elijah's we still have prophets right up and that's fine I'm respectful to that but listen God chose one and I want to find out who that one is it's not because you say you have the spirit of Elijah God put the spirit of Elijah on you and you're the one the devil has a work to try to impersonate the real thing before it comes but I want you to get this point that it can't be lived through someone else let me be simple young people you can't get in on your parents coattails you can't say their Heirs of this thing you can't say there so I'm going to get in and so I'm going to come up some other way and say no no no though what what God is saying to Abraham you're trying to come up and go through someone else through this promise but I'm saying to you that it's going to come out of you yeah it's going this promise is going to be fulfilled in you notice how God always is personalizing it because we feel doubt about ourselves we feel the promises coming we we question we get doubts about whether we have something we have all that but you see now God has to remind us no everything I'm doing in this age is related to you it will come out of you it's not going to just because a preacher is preaching it over the pulpit and you're part of the message no everything of the promise and the Mystery from this hour is going to be can I say it Christ in you the hope of glory and because it's worded that way it's never in a group it's never in a movement it's not a worldwide thing it's Christ in you the hope of glory This Promise of this hour will happen and come out of you Gabriella Hannah brother Joe Holden This Promise will come through you why do we have to be reminded Abraham had to be reminded of it so we have to be reminded of it so that we don't try to go through the mystery can't be fulfilled by another person than you Abraham Eliza was a great servant the promise could not be fulfilled in a Leisure can you say Amen there are great Servants of the Lord there are great preachers there are Mighty gifts Even in our own ranks there are Mighty gifts but I want to remind everybody Abraham is trying to point to the servant we have Servants of Christ but the air it's not that they're a servant The Heir The Inheritance the promise will come through individuals it's going to come through you so don't have your dependence on a preacher don't have your dependence on a great preacher the promise of the messes of the hour will be fulfilled through individuals through your life and if preachers come and go if people come and go if families Fall by the wayside that's why you got to look at what God's doing in you everybody might fall to the Wayside but it's not to everybody can you say Amen you say this is my promise and if nobody else is living it I know it's going to come out of me somebody say praise the Lord this morning ready Hallelujah and so it's not a servant Abraham I'm still revisiting you to confirm my promise to you you can't depend on them you can't depend on servants you can't depend on them and see your part fulfilled but Abraham I'm visiting you to confirm the promise but you need to know it'll come out of you from the inside out it can't live through someone else it's got to come out of you so I've been asking people lately I've been a little bit bold to ask them just asked a young man the other day and uh and so I've been asking them and they'll say things like I've been I've been wanting to get back to church I've been wanting to do this I've been wanting to get this right in my life and I've been asking them I'm going to ask you and I want you to ask the honesty is this is this I want to get back in church what are you coming for are you coming because you miss your friends are you coming because we have a good volleyball team come on are you coming because the potluck food is pretty good are you coming because we got a big church are you coming because you like the music you better check why you're coming because I'm asking these questions because if you can say that I've missed the word I've missed the presence of God I miss being there I was getting fed and now I know I'm starving and now I'm coming if you can answer honestly that I came back because I'm starving and I want to hear the word that's a good reason to come back because not it's not about friends at the end of the day it's not about the social thing in a church oh I wish I could preach this for a while the core of why we attend this assembly is not all the other stuff that goes with it not Sunday school all that where that's all ministries of this church we thank God for it but if you had all that and not catch the core of what God is speaking to us last Sunday the Lord spoke so directly to this congregation did you catch it did you miss it because the core we have nothing except we have this message to preach this church is unstable without the stability of the word of God that's been put in place and if you can't make it a priority that this is the core where I bring my family to sit here and to teach my children to sit here and take this hour hopefully not an hour and a half hopefully an hour hopefully brother oh it's only an hour but if I can't take this hour and completely focus and give my life and say I want to receive What the Lord Has for me your life will become shaky help me Lord and you'll be concerned about all the gossip in the church and all the things and everything else about the church and whether they're making administrative decisions right you'll be distracted by the core of who we are I'll tell you as a pastor I can't stand administrative stuff I never liked doing any of it I wish we could just come to church play the tambourine and the piano Worship the Lord and hear the word and that's it can't have a church this big without having an administration of people helping you in different departments and different Ministries you have to have it but I don't like I like just this right here I like just this is the core of what we are if we didn't have a tambourine I could still have church if we didn't have the excellent playing of these musicians we got the very best I believe we've got the very best God has blessed us with if we didn't have any of that we can still have church why are you saying that why are you saying that because all this is Ministries it's all ministering to you these guys are dedicated they pray and they give their gift to God they're dedicated to you and to this assembly so it's not a bad thing but I'm just saying I'm trying to get you back why do we come the core is the word the core is because we will go nowhere without receiving the the foundation and the the completion of the adoption of where this word is taking us I'm asking the Lord help me not to be mean but to be direct I asked him some people do you do you come with your friends did you wear did you do the right thing or did you start wearing the right thing because you're you're dad is the pastor or your dad is the deacon or is it coming out of you from the depths of you it's a huge question and I just don't mind saying it because I know I love them to say it find out if it's this is what he's saying to Abraham I want to remind you this promise will come from the depths of your bowels in you not anybody else and so you can't copy another man's Spirit I've been reading some of the quotes about uh brother Brian referring to the congregation uh picking up on the pastor's spirit and I've just balanced it out by saying he said that the pastor uh can jerk his head a certain way and the rest of the congregation does it the same way then he says Pastor be can be so starchy he said the church acts the same way the point is is that you take someone else's Spirit ex and not the holy spirit for yourself and we get into the rush of a movement and everything and everybody's doing something if you're doing it because somebody else is doing it that's a big deal because you shouldn't do it because someone else is doing it worship should be spontaneous praise in the Holy Ghost worship should be stimulation of Revelation you don't have to work up worship I've never had to work it up this morning I preached the word and stimulation of Revelation automatically spontaneously happens if you're in the word you're going to get excited about what I preach and you may not death you may sit there and just weep over the word that's your way of worshiping that's your way of worshiping all right praise the Lord can't copy another man's Spirit you can't emotionally try to duplicate what others are doing you can't put on a show and act like you have the Holy Ghost the promise is to you and it will come forth from you and only you how many knows the promise of the Holy Ghost is to you and to your children he says those words he didn't say the promises to your children the promises to your church his first words this promise of the Holy Ghost is unto you you and to your children so I'll take that promise I'm going to keep praying I'm going to give my children to the Lord because in the promise it's not only for me but you can pray for your children as well and don't stop praying for him can you say Amen they didn't get the right thing whatever it is don't stop praying for them hold on to that promise and to many as far of even as the many as the Lord Our God shall call but I like it it starts the promises unto you why that's personal you can't copy you can't put on a show the problem is unto you it'll come forth from you the mystery of Christ is in you is the hope of glory blending in is not the way can you say Amen blending in with the group is not the way comparing your experience with another's experience is not the way God gives everyone an experience and and it's the same Holy Ghost but it's a different experience it's different how God brings you and forms you I can tell you last Sunday and we might have to cut this part out I don't know but I can tell you there's no way a man could preach that anointed of a message and speak from his the depths of his heart unless and I know this of what he's been through the last three or four years of his life because you see seed thing God bless sister Kelly she knows she just went through it God allows almost getting killed in a car wreck a few weeks ago and also a shooter if she'd have been there she'd have been shot with her with her uh employee or the other employee had to go to the funeral this week or last week right testing time but you know what God just forms things to bring out just the right ding of the Bell in your life God will take a pastor through things for 15 20 years and it might end up in one sermon that's how committed God is to your lives he'll form that man Until It Breaks off into one sermon all those trials for one sermon and you weren't there oh I'm making the point if God is committed to you that way then we should be committed to him sloppy commitment it's a time we live in it's just sloppy commitment but God is really committed to us can you say Amen so now can't take another man's spirit in verses 5 and 6 I got to move along here uh verses five and six are mind-blowing if you read it again chapter 15 5 6 and he brought him forth and said look now toward heaven and tell the Stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto them so shall thy seed be my Boingo I want you to see the power of this Abraham I want you to see where this message is going this promise is going look up and count the Stars try to count them that's the potency of This Promise Abraham I'm going to do it you're not going to do it I'm going to do it matter of fact I'm giving you the promise I'm giving you the promise I'm making a covenant with myself over your life this is the Abraham Covenant it wasn't between the people and him it was God making swearing by himself is the Covenant it's a good thing it doesn't deal with you it's god making his own Covenant over your life the Grace Covenant I'm going to give you a promise I'm going to give you a covenant I'm going to give you a sacrifice to confirm I'm going to give you all these things and now I'm going to show you where all this is going look to the stars and try to count them and guess what your Heir from your own loins what's going to come out of your life try to count them in the stars because that's what's coming from you that's the potency of this promise I'm going to do it you're not going to do it I'm going to do it as you believe me probably most of us in this church and online are living way below what the promise can do in US but every once in a while God comes on and tells us where's this go where is this going in your life and you have to reach out and believe it I know where I'm at today you say I know what my past is and actually you got to get past your past but every once in a while God shows you you know what I have in you this is where it can go I can't even have a baby I can't even have a baby and he's telling me my heirs my children my family will grow more than the Stars God likes to blow our minds God likes to build our faith God likes to challenge our faith are you going to believe that and guess what there's the next scripture and Abraham believed he said all right I got a revelation of this because it wasn't just in his intellectual God dropped a revelation he said you know what my seed will be as the Stars that's what you said I don't see it yet but guess what Lord I'm going to tell you 100 that ain't nothing but the truth yeah that but the truth I believe it with all my heart and guess what the next scripture says and God said because you believe that way he you are righteous before my eyes I just took all the debts and all the sin out of your account and cleared it wiped it clean and the only way that I can see you from here on out is righteous before my eyes because he had works because he did something no he believed by revelation I don't see my my seed yet I don't see where it's going but I believe my seed's going to go that far I believe this promise in me of the Holy Ghost is going to go that far in my life I see the potential of where this can go I'm not there yet but I see the potential and I believe I'm gonna be a full matured adopted son of God a pillar in the house of God and he put it on his account clear paid in full righteous before my eyes and Satan can never have access to the account I should close and we that our names remember I've creased on the motive for our worship is not that the devils are subject to us but that our names are written in the last book of life that ought to make us Shout that he has the power not only to speak your future in front of you but to say because you believe this way your account has righteousness I can never look at you except righteous before my eyes did Abraham deserve that no he didn't but it's unmerited Grace then Abraham asked for an Evidence that's common to us Lord what's the evidence of the Holy Ghost what's the evidence that I have it Lord is there some way that I will know that I shall inherit it it's hard to believe Abraham's asking for that but it's like us as human beings can I know the evidence of the Holy Ghost can I know the evidence I have it then it's going to can I have something you know what God gives them a blood sacrifice and that means he just wants us to keep looking at the sacrifice he shows him his future he asks him to believe it but then when he asks for can can you he ask whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it he want an extra confirmation all he gives is a blood sacrifice and you worship you come and worship me every day you come and worship me at this perfect sacrifice and I will come and answer by fire I will confirm all this but I need you to worship now it becomes about worship and I think it's interesting I'm having time to get into this now I promise we won't be long today but I I can I have just a few more minutes because this is this is really good I can't pass this part up even though I got another probably 25 messages the rest of the year pastors have that right but we like to preach it all in one service and get it done but you see uh when when he was there and and so now God points him to this right sacrifice lays it out God lays out these these different ones that type Christ if you study your Bible the the turtle dove the the she-goat three years old all these things type perfectly of Christ laid there he split up he didn't split up the birds I don't believe but he split up the other animals blood's all over there and so God points him to a sacrifice the right sacrifice of blood so in the meantime his worship can be right to stay here and worship under this pure sacrifice and I will answer completely and he did come and answer later in in a dream or a vision he'd come back and there was a light that come and a furnace that come and passed between those two pieces confirming to Abraham you can read it later but until then he set the right sacrifice how many believe this morning we have the right sacrifice how many believe it's a perfect sacrifice how many believe without it we're lost and he wants us to worship under that sacrifice there's no other place to worship where my God accepts the worship that under the shed blood of Jesus Christ that's it it's simple it's not any more complicated than that and the message came to remind us of that sacrifice oh Hallelujah the message came to push back all the fouls and all the traditions and all the Creeds that was messing with the pure sacrifice once he gets all that out of the way we can worship freely we can worship purely Hallelujah so in this time of worship to being right you stay here and worship under this pure sacrifice notice God gave the promise God gave a covenant God gave the sacrifice let me raise your hands we're blessed with the same thing we've got a promise of this hour to be fulfilled we've got a Covenant of Grace over our lives we heard about last Sunday and we've got the right sacrifice we got everything that we need to worship Him freely and purely and then my final subject is out of verse 11 perfect promise the pure Covenant the pure sacrifice and verse 11 speaks volumes because guess what Abraham had to drive away fouls from trying to taint the sacrifice I just believe that if Abraham had to do that and we're Abraham's seed we have to do it as well and I'm going to say some things this morning that are relation to this that I've been wanting to say the lord gave me the scripture a couple months ago and now I'm just getting to it I just was struggling yesterday said Lord what do you want me to speak I don't want to speak my own mind I want to speak you give me something fresh had to wait till tomorrow last night till about six seven o'clock I stayed in all day I didn't go I was supposed to take some paint cans to the recycle completely forgot it because I started studying at eight in the morning stayed all day and I I couldn't get the mind of the Lord until finally something struck through about six seven o'clock and he spoke to my heart and he led me back to this scripture I thank the Lord for speaking to me when I was a young Minister and I went to Brother Lonnie to Europe I don't know if I ever told you this but I got the greatest lesson for a young minister I wrote her brother Lonnie I went to the trip just to carry his bags for the rap just to carry his bags because I knew nobody knows asked me to preach because well I was young in Europe they didn't use young ministers then they didn't believe in them now they do and they're having me and brother rap which I'm so glad in in Holland at a family camp in no in November second week in November so guess they're having young ministers now rap they changed when I was around young ministers they didn't believe in them it had to be older seniors and so I don't know why I said that but anyway I was there right in the car and I got in the car because this other Pastor from Norway brother Ryerson was sitting in the seat he rode to church with us so we're sitting there beloney and them and I got in the car and they let me do a youth meeting that morning I was preaching a youth meeting I had studied all night getting ready for it and we get in the car and the car's quiet and sister Ryerson she looked over to me in like a glow on her face and she you could tell she had been praying for the service herself very Godly woman had reached just the levels of just a walk with the Lord that I I so loved that and desire that and she looked over at me and she goes hath the Lord spoken to you this morning brother Paul I don't know if you knew her brother Stephen but hath the Lord spoken to you this morning brother Paul you talk about a challenging question and I got more wisdom as a young Minister because it was like it was like she was saying if the Lord hasn't spoken to you I'm not even sure I want to go to church [Applause] because she had grown like this isn't about you just putting things together as a sermon and preaching sermon and trying to impress everybody hath the Lord spoken to you brother Paul talk about a seminary I learned a lot and that's what my desire has been three years I don't want to preach sermons I don't want to be the greatest preacher in the message I don't want to compete I don't want to fight I have nothing to do with that I just want to find the mind of the Lord and preach it to my people it's just that simple and that's why the Lord spoke to me I like to say that not to make myself spiritual but you wait on the Lord you labor in the Lord I would love for some of you instead of some of the other things you do Saturday night oh boy do I need to get on this I would like you to prepare your hearts instead of watching a bunch of movies or whatever you do and this that and the other maybe settle down Saturday and join in prayer with me that there might be somebody that needs the Holy Ghost there might be somebody in these Deliverance I'm praying that God deals with the minister this morning and I'm going to come pray it up for the service instead maybe you gossiped about everything that's going on and made it normal in your life I think we should become spiritual and prayer warriors that we should start joining in with the rest of the body of Christ and maybe I'll ask you hath the Lord spoken to you this morning people of God so Abraham he's got to drive away the fowls from the sacrifice there will always be an enemy that's trying to taint our worship as a matter of fact he's at the point of worship he's at the point he's he's there around the sacrifice and the worship to imitate it to misdirect it because if it's the right sacrifice and it's the right worshiper with the right heart a lot of powerful things can happen right there so we have an enemy by this type that's flying around coming down and Abraham has to keep he has to keep shoeing this stuff away from the sacrifice to keep it simple to keep it pure amen there will always be an enemy trying to attain our worship trying to defile our worship and I think it should be pure I think it should be simple I think it should be sincere and if anything else comes around I got some stuff Wednesday night talk about uh uh a minister saying Spurgeon and he elaborates on this and he's just elaborating on all the thoughts that come to us while we're in church I'm gonna read something to you it's powerful evil thoughts and thoughts of business and when you come in you got to shoot all that stuff away so you can worship freely it's powerful I want to read it praise the Lord but you know what we have to keep this off of our sacrifice you know I'm always looking for a little cue especially yesterday on what to preach you know and I remember yesterday morning something triggered in my heart something one of my daughters said and I wouldn't say the name and I want to embarrass him but they said something really stuck with me and it's related to this subject a little bit I'm always like I'm always looking for a little cue for a sermon maybe that's why people are nervous to be around me foreign but uh this subject opened up a little bit because my daughter said just and not not bitter but I'm so tired of all the drama and the stuff and the fighting that goes on in our ranks in the message I don't want to hear any of it she said I just want to stay simple serving the lord and I've spoken from the heart and brother Chris addressed it he said the unbeliever May hesitate coming if he gets online or if he comes in and sees there's nothing but Division and device of things being said the lack of love and respect they might not even come and he said what a shame they would even darken the door because they've already concluded they don't know the doctrines we believe they don't know they don't even know the prophet we believe they don't they're going to base it upon the Harmony and the unity and the love and the respect they see amongst the people not a device of spirit I think he was right Paul Harvey I'm trying to track this down but I was told by a reputable Minister one time that Paul Harvey who was a radio host in the nation he's passed away now he was presented with the message and he was presented with um what the group that believes the message of the last days through the prophet William Branham and he he so he he looked into it and this was his comment Paul Harvey about it he said don't worry about that group they're no threat to anything because there's so much division among them that they can't even get it together among themselves now I don't like to say things like that because I don't like to present in a negative I like to talk about the positive because there's more positive going on than there is negative I don't like to say that because people take that yeah that's right and they become negative themselves and you know there's been even people say because all that you know I'm ditching the message when you don't know what the message is because it's not that it's the message of Christ for the last days to bring us back to Bible faith that's the message but I don't want to be too negative but here's a man saying it's no threat because there's just so much going on in so many different doctrines and things so I only say that to say that was the rules great statement by my daughter because I get the same thing and so uh when you hear that I could get angry I could close in my shell uh I I I I could have take a certain attitude towards that I don't want that but I do want to reflect what my daughter said that I really want to keep this simple what the message is and I just don't want to part be part of any fighting I want to just serve god with sincerely sincerity and godly fear and just let him speak to me through the message and keep it simple and keep the fouls off the sacrifice Hallelujah I have to realize there's a true thing that God sent it's a pure word it's a pure message it's a pure promise it's a strong Covenant the person of our Lord Jesus Christ who we love has been revealed through this message I'm answering a question here it's his word it's God's word this message brought me closer to the person of Christ and it revealed more of him it's not any more complicated than that you say the message is Christ the message revealed Jesus Christ the person of Christ pull up Hagee eye 1 and verse 13. I love this scripture if you wanted to know if the term the message is in the Bible yes it is Hagee eye 1 and verse 13. hege I one verse 13. then spake haggai the Lord's messenger in the Lord's message oh I liked it anyway then spake hagai the prophet the Lord's messenger in the Lord's message unto the people saying I Am with You saith the Lord so here we have the messenger and the message that's what we have in the last days but I want to remind everybody whose is it it's the Lord's it's the Lord's messenger and those are really two different things even though they're coordinated together but they're two things especially when the messenger goes off the scene the emphasis is not in the messenger's life as much it's on the message that he brought you see you understand but they both come from the lord it's this is not William branham's message this is not my message this is actually the message the Lord Jesus Christ this is Christ and he sent the messenger and he sent the message this is why the devil fights against this more than anything else this shout to be a Vindication and Confirmation to us why is it that this thing has fought against so much has come against so much and there's so much fighting going on around it and there's so much doubt now he's not the messenger of somebody else there's some why is there so much controversy for all these years around this messenger and around this message it could be the reason that it's the Lord's did you ever think it's the Lord's and that's why the devil is fighting it so much so if we know that we're not going to get rid of it we're not going to get rid of the controversy but we are going to be part of shoeing the fowls away that complicated is anybody on board with me there's anybody picking up what I'm laying down we are part of shoeing these fouls that try to pervert the sacrifice and pervert our worship and get us off to one side of fanaticism or one side to starchism I'm telling you I want the middle of the road of this word said the powers in the middle of the road the powers in the middle of the road not to one side he says you come to the Lord and he says over time he said the devil will try to take you off into fanaticism or take you off into starchism and intellectualism but he says the real power of God is right in the middle of the road I want to stay in the middle of the road I want to worship freely with all my heart and I want to be taught as a son and daughter a Son of God the principles of God praise the Lord because it is from the Lord there will be a lot of imbalances and fanaticism because the devil even knows it's the Lord's messenger and message in fact it should be assigned to us that it is right it's so misused and so attacked I don't believe other prophets and I don't believe other ministers even Billy Graham or any of the prominent Ministers of that generation are attacked like this messenger has been attacked but I'm like my father Abraham chewing the files off this keep it pure and simple the fowls what are we shooting off why are we shooting off the table of sacrifice the fowls the fouses files of worldliness you're creeping in get off of there and remember I was taught this as a young Minister worship worship is more than just raising our hands in church worship is your everyday life worship before God it's your life that you live I want to remind everybody of that it's not just you clap your hands and you sang loud in church worship is so much deeper than that it's keeping the the fowls of worldliness preachers Don't Preach on modesty and clothes and movies every once in a while if we don't say it every once in a while then then the files are going to take over somebody's got to say it if he doesn't talk about music the wrong kind of music if I'm asking you to join me because ministers true ministers do this they're shoeing the files off the sacrifice my worship can't be tainted with Christian rock music and country music and rock and roll music and Christian rock My Worship can't be tainted because that's tainted worship that's tainted worship even for our own assembly I have no problem correcting I rarely have to correct it because I see the heart of the musicians but if there's a boundary or something is something overrides the true pure worship and it goes too far I'm all over it become the bad guy sometimes I rarely have to do it thank the Lord here but I'm willing to do it because everywhere worship's going on the devil's there to taint it come on you don't think the devil's around music around worship of music Satan trying to taint music change it to a performance change it to celebrities to take the Purity and the sincerity out of worship I'm always at my post to watch something sneak in I think we need the balance of free worship and borrowing from what others do too much borrowing from others who don't have the absolutes that we have everything is not okay music is not immoral I mean by that is that people say that music by itself without words music is immoral there's no morality or immorality with it that's not true music by itself can have an immoral spirit with it so you keep this let me get off of that you you're shooing away all the wrong doctrines that's come around the message the deity doctrine that makes brother Branham Jesus Christ the doctrines that say we're already in the millennium you're in the Millennium already I'm in the millennium I'm very disappointed I'm shooting that one away that's tainted and you use quotes to prove it but I don't want to hear your quotes that's a foul trying to make this thing complicated from the Simplicity of this sacrifice can you say man doctrinal fouls competition legalism coming off the message come on say amen that's exact ly and we've had a lot of it people say there's they're not supposed to be doing that and I say well where's it at where show me where it's at and they say well it's somewhere well show me where it's at because I want to preach that to my whole congregation and they're all going to be doing that I better know that it's there there's a lot of things years ago that people quoted I don't know for the kins here today but we love to go over this because he was in the early years in the message and we always bring up those things that was quoted across the pulpit somebody does yes brother Brandon said this brother and you go find it you can't find it you need to wear this and and that was legalism coming from a Holiness background attaching itself to this message no no don't add your stuff to it don't add or take away I believe what he said and I believe everything's important that he said but don't add to it you just chew it away I shoe way legalism I shoe away formalism intellectualism I believe in the moving of the spirit of God some people don't think I believe that I believe with all my heart we've had it here for 35 years we're going to keep doing it preach the word you want to shout dance if you want to whatever you need to do but if you get excited about the word and God changed in your life worship as the Lord it dictates to you I don't want formalism I want I don't want just quotes I don't want you coming and bringing your iPad like I got and just going through all the quotes and checking me and making sure that I'm saying everything right and I say something wrong then you go nope not in here this is about the Holy Spirit working in our lives it's not about intellectually understanding all the quotes and scriptures formalism intellectualism extreme emotionalism we're shooting those fouls off bitterness yeah anger we got some Angry Birds that come around playing some Angry Birds some of you older ones don't know what I'm talking about get some Angry Birds around the sacrifice there's angry people I'm shooting those anger Spirits away disrespect Pride of the message I'm shooting it away get rid of that Pride that says we're the only ones that have truth and we're the only ones that's right you ought to Rejoice what God is doing wherever it's at my wife showed me a testimony of a black man that was baptized in an Apostolic Church the other day he was completely blind had been blind for a long time when he come out by to being baptized in the name of Jesus Christ his eyes were open and they began to shout Hallelujah that didn't happen in our own ranks but God did it God did it and I Rejoice on what God does wherever it may be they might not preach the full truth they might do that but I'm not going to label them whatever God does in a life we ought to celebrate it can you say man you never get that Pride to belittle somebody get behind me this morning this is hard to preach but I'm tired of the The Pride that comes around that we've got a a monopoly on truth and we're the only ones that's right and I don't like that Pride can you say Amen we need humility in the Holy Ghost we need the true sincere look at this message and what it is and to manifest what it really is chew away the fowls of unforgiving spirits and Hate I always wonder why I was years ago there was a boy that come to a youth meeting and he was jumping on top of one of the girls or she on top of him I can't remember now but I was all over that I said that's not what we do around here there's not some people offended about about it I said I'm supposed to leave that alone when he's acting inappropriately I always feel bad about these things but I realize now scripture hits it's the pastor keeping the fouls away I didn't tell him to leave I just said don't do that again but he left he's not serving the lord today because he couldn't take correction but I'm not going to let that go by and I've had to do tons of these things you don't realize sometimes what has to be just just brought back in place so we can enjoy even this sanctuary we don't bring coffees in here we dedicate this place as holy unto the Lord we worship in here we're not going to have lunch in here but if I didn't shoo that away because of the modern Church some of you would be bringing your coffees eventually and asking if you can bring them in you don't think that's true it's true somebody's got to shoot that far away the worship needs to stay pure and simple before God untainted it's not that coffee's evil boy I'd really be in trouble if I preach that man I'd have a bunch of people leaving my church and I'd leave myself [Applause] what am I doing when I have to speak up and correct our young boys for inappropriate foolish sexual talk in the youth group I'm shooting the fouls away you don't start that in here stop I don't know where you learned that stop talking like that stop texting people like that somebody's got to do it I I wish me to be more people help me the files away from the sacrifice I love him this morning I love you I got to end this now and I'm going to go now into a little bit of not right now but I'm going to go from this point into worship and into the evidence of the Holy Ghost there's many subjects that break from here and I want to go into those things and talk about them clearly and plainly but I think that we need to we're in a time where we want to bring pure we're coming to communion tonight Paul said eat the bread of sincerity and Truth unleavened bread of sincerity and Truth you'll find in this message I had communion that's the last thing brother Bram says before he leaves this Earth as a car accident the Lord takes him his last sentence is let's just be reverent when you come let us be just as reverent as we know how to come this is a great message this isn't a break lord it's a great promise it's a great sacrifice this is this is wonderful let's keep it pure let's brush all the fly the fouls away from it let's keep our worship Simple Pure and free untainted before him Stand Together holy holy holy holy holy holy Lord God Almighty as we lift our hands in worship and we magnify your name holy holy holy holy holy
