[Music] monster [Music] High [Music] [Music] she is don't help me [Music] [Music] please [Applause] [Music] I've never lost I never lost my praise [Music] is still here [Music] thank you [Music] Lord Lord Jesus [Music] Christ [Music] Genesis chapter 3 and verse 14 and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou has done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt out go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel I want to read that part again because it's a very interesting one scripture in between all the curses of God in between the Judgment of God because whenever there's sin there has to be judgment so as he's handing out the Judgment in the middle of all this is a prophecy of redemption and it says I will put enmity between the thee in the woman between thy scene and Herzing it shall bruise there's a prophecy it shall bruise thy head and speak into the servant and thou shalt bruise his heel unto the woman he said said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and in thy conception and sorrow thou shall bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee and unto Adam he said because Thou Art hearken unto the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree of which I have commanded these things Thou shalt not eat of it and cursed as the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it was thou taken for Dost thou art and unto dust shalt thou return in the last few Services we showed the fall in the garden and the Oneness that was broke with God and then the Oneness that was broke with one another and we know that all the relationships were destroyed from their relationship with God and all the way down to the home and uh so we have elaborated on that but in this service we want to take a bit of a turn we want to take a transition and we want to move from talking about the the results of the fall and what took place and begin to look at what God would do and how he would do it to reverse all of this to change all of this and to to redeem his sons out of this mess that we got ourselves in or Adam and Eve got us in so how would God reverse it it's very important that we know that it's very important that we know how God's Redemption takes place it's important that we know it's the power of it how powerful it is because it had to be pretty powerful to Deliver Us from the state that we're in uh but it's very important we know how God chose and the reason is is because man can always come up with ideas to try to redeem himself out of this state that he's in and because of that we want to make crystal clear God's way of redemption God's chosen way of redemption because that's the only way that we can get back to God God's way of redemption is the only way back men can try different ways they can give they can give themselves to Public Service they can live their whole life in public service but if they have the guilt and sin of sin on their soul then God has a way to take care of that and release it and forgive them they can't take care of that on their own there are certain problems that we have that we cannot take care of on our own we are helpless and only God can do it and when the fall took place then God began to begin to lay out his Plan of Redemption and as you know God allowed in the greater mystery of it all God allowed this to happen God didn't create this but God allowed this fall to take place in order for his bigger Plan of Redemption to unfold and that his attributes would be displayed because some of God cannot be expressed in perfection when we think of God we think of perfection but some of the attributes of God cannot be expressed and come out unless there's an imperfection unless there's a fall unless there's a mistake unless there's someone who's fallen and can't get up can you say Amen there are some attributes of of God and particularly the the entire work of redemption could not be expressed until man had fallen so there's a certain part of this that he allowed to take place so that more of his attributes could be expressed can you say Amen so so now some of God could not be expressed so now we see then that man was in a place who uh that he could never pull himself out of he could not help himself it's it's like the song says win nothing else could help Love Lifted Me I love that lyric when nothing else could help you get in States there's nothing else that can help you except God accept his love and it's very important we know that in this proud generation because we have so many things to fix things we have so many we have access to so much that can fix things and we try to fix everything but we need to be humble and realize there's certain things that you cannot fix there's certain things in life and actually the more things you turn over to God he'll fix it the right way but we have to humbly admit there's certain things I can't do it Lord I don't want to offer any help to it I don't want to after any assistance I can't do it if it's going to get done I yield to do you because there are certain problems that only God can take care of that's humility can you say Amen I was Sinking Deep in sin so far from the shore all these lyrics I was sinking and it was this this this depth of Sin from the garden it was so lodged in the spirit of man in other words this fall was just not a mistake this was not just a mistake this was huge to where this sin lodged in man's Spirit can you say Amen so that he didn't just have problems because we read the problems of relationship that come from the fall he had problems and man had problems ever since the fall there's always been problems he's saying to Adam there under Adam's curse he'd curse the ground he couldn't curse Adam because he was the son of God so he cursed the ground so you're going to work by the sweater of your brow you're you're going to have thorns and thistles grow up in your garden yeah he that's under the curse and there it is and we're still dealing with that crabgrass we're still dealing with the Thorns can you say Matt so he's dishing out all these things and he's he's giving it what what Adam but so Adam had problems because of the Fall Adam had to work by the sweat of his brow because of the Fall we're still dealing with Allah but I want to just say I'm not talking about today so much the problems as I'm talking about the problem singular because there was one problem with Adam and everyone after him that was so deep and so ingrained in his nature there wasn't anything that he could do to fix it it was so deep it was so ingrained it went right to into his Spirit right into his nature and Only God and let me say this only God knew the depth of the fall in the garden Only God know how knew how deep it was I don't believe Adam knew how deep it was I don't believe Eve knew Cain certainly didn't know and everywhere from there they didn't realize the depth of what took place it wasn't just a mistake that Satan himself came and injected himself into the human race lodged his own nature in the spirit and the soul of man that's pretty deep only God knew the depth of the Fall I don't even think I'm sometimes I wonder when people don't cry out for the Holy Ghost in their lives and really get a deep experience with God maybe they don't understand how deep the serpent nature is rooted within us because if they really understood you know we're always looking for the good things we do we always looking to Pat ourselves in the back we are but but man in his nature when he's born there's a problem can you say amen and you can be good and you can give and you can help people and you can be a a a decent person in society and my kids are good people praise the Lord I'd rather have good people on the Earth than bad people I love that but that doesn't deal with the problem the problem goes deeper in our nature and only God can deal with that problem you need to know there's one problem that that trumps all problems and that's the nature that we're born with and if we go our whole lives and deal with our problems even with the Lord but ignore the problem then we're missing something what's what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul if we can ignore the one problem so I got I struggle in this and I do this and I I put this on and I wear this on my ears and I do this and I struggle with this and okay okay but you see now see that's all that's all just uh that's symptoms let's not talk about the symptoms I mean I could lay it down the line and show you the the dress code that comes right from the Bible for you sisters and brothers sometimes I do it but I could lay it out just as crystal clear some of you still wouldn't follow it but I could lay it out and you could line up with it and I would appreciate that praise the Lord but listen that doesn't deal with a deeper problem it's pretty exciting now to read our text because right in the middle of the curses right in the middle of the curses and the judgments being handed out there's a strong bold Proclamation from our god of redemption already it's the first little section of scripture that prophesies of redemption and he does it right in the middle of the curses being handed out I love that there's a strong bold statement guess who he's speaking it to he's speaking it to the serpent he's saying something to the serpent I see what you've done I've observed what you've done I know this goes deeper than man can ever help himself and now I have to lay out curses on you on Adam and on Eve I have to because God's a God of Justice there has to be a payment can you say man there has to be something take place to to when we make when even we make a mistake there has if you're in God's world there has to be some type of punishment for it there has to be a response about it you don't just get off scot-free when you make a mistake come on people listen these are simple things I'm if you do something sin has to have a response sin has to be taken care of you're going to own up to it you don't get off scot-free if you do something privately with yourself and you think nobody sees you there'll be a there'll be something that will come as the fruit that comes from that because that's the way life Works can you say that's the way God's kingdom work is works as well but in the middle of the curses in the middle of the judgments being handed out there's a strong Proclamation from God uh that goes directly to the serpent in the middle of justice is Mercy being predicted in the middle of the judgments of God being handed out God puts in Mercy for his sons and daughters it's not all cursed it's not a job and they're going to come underneath it and it's going to happen it's going to happen for thousands of years but God just laced in their puts in there but say sir but uh Satan I say Satan because he cursed the serpent to the ground became a snake but he's still speaking to this to Satan and he said I want to let you know I see the problem they don't even see it I see the fall I see what's done it goes deep but I want to let you know I'm going to deal with some with it someday and Satan I'm going to deal with you and I'm gonna do it my own way and when I do it it's going to be permanent and God says God says you may strike at the heel even of my people you'll strike at the heel of this seat at Calvary but I will crush your head through Christ [Applause] is God saying he's going to deal with it yeah he's going to deal with it and by the way we're post Calvary now so he's already dealt with it at Calvary he's already crushed the head of the serpent all he can do is is Bluff with you all he can do is threaten you all he can do is bully you he has no power over what God said that you are he has no power this morning he's a bluff can you say amen he he he is a he is my dad used to say he got his teeth taken out of calvary and all he can do is gum you to death I want you to notice now when he comes into his power of redemption and you're already responding saying my my my my my this is powerful this isn't just a Band-Aid on the problem he's going to deal with the problem of sin and he is going to make it so permanent his sons and daughters look at them they're hiding they're scared they're walking with their tail between the legs Adam and Eve hiding in the bushes bullied by the enemy speaking in shame speaking in guilt come on read your Bible there they are hiding guilt shame and they're scared and they're and they're they're blaming one another and they're trying to Dish it off and they're doing they're all a lot of sorts their minds are just gone here and they're walking with their tail between like scared and bullied by the enemy but I want to say that's not with God he's not scared he's not bullied by the enemy can you say man he says I know my son and daughter have failed but I'm making something crystal clear to you serpent I will deal with this and then I will deal with you so right there he proclaimed that my people will come to the powerful work of my Redemption there's nothing Satan can ever do it begins the Prophecies of redemption dealing with his people all the way till we come to the the birth of Christ and that seed and we'll get to that in just a minute the powerful work of redemption he wasn't just going to put a Band-Aid on your problem this goes deeper than just putting a Band-Aid on your serpent nature that you're born with goes deeper than just you know I can fix this I can fix this you ever seen people I can fix this leave it alone don't worry about it I can fix this we can fix everything you can't fix that nature that you're born with but God says I'm not only going to fix it I'm going to crush his head so today I want to get specific about the powerful work of redemption and how deep it goes you know it's often that Bible terms get used through the years and they lose their meaning I think Redemption has lost its meaning a little bit we have to know how powerful God has provided a way of redemption for you Redemption has lost its it's been watered down and somebody now is redeemed because they come and shake the preacher's hand or they come to a church and they enjoy the youth group and now I've been redeemed no no no no no no no no Redemption is a process and Redemption God handles it and it's a deep deep work that takes place in you it's it's a long lasting work and you say amen and by the way it had a sacrifice with it because you don't have the Redemption of this deep problem without a huge sacrifice and guess what you didn't have to make that yourself Christ made it for you that Eve we know the cause of the Fall Eve disbelieved the word eve reason with the serpent and she left the word she was off on just one percent of it 99 of what was true as one percent lie and she believed the Lie Part she she reasoned with the serpent and that's how we know that's how the fall took place when you get away from the word then then it becomes chaos that's what happened in the garden and then we have all this trouble today even six thousand years later because Eve left the word every hospital every prison do you realize it was one word that Eve doubted listen to this now it was one word that Eve doubted and that caused all the trouble one spoken of word of God Eve doubted to be the truth and the greatest thing that I've been thinking about as the greatest problem that came from the Paul Paul is that every man was born with the nature of we would love to have perfect children and I know some people when they have babies think their children are perfect but none of them are perfect they're flawed and you can have Grace for them because you were born flawed you weren't born perfect so can you imagine how deep this problem goes is that um we could safely say that we are a born loser because you know I'm going to turn this around to positive in a minute and it can't get but positive when you talk about Calvary but all of us no matter how rich a family we were born in no matter if our dad was a preacher no matter if our dad was a deacon no matter how good where we're at now all of that we have to admit we're all born with the same nature and God had to deal with it and some may go way into sin and some may do little private sins but guess what we're all guilty we're all born with something we can't help all your best men that you look out in the face of the Earth and that's why all the best men all the most perfect people you can think of still we can't help one another out of this pit because we're all born with the same nature they looked in Revelations 5 who's worthy to take the book who's worthy to deal with this problem if somebody doesn't take this book of Redemption all creation is lost they look through the whole earth and couldn't find anybody worthy of the best people even even all the good people in the Old Testament and the Patriarchs we look up to none of them was worthy why because they were born just like us somebody that's born like you can't help you we cling to people we cling to family relationship and it's fine we clean and we become codependent on other people they can help me they've helped and we lean on it too much what we need to do is lean on the Lord we stand alone with the Lord and say Lord you deal with me internally let me not depend on someone else because no one can pull us out of the pit of this myri clay except the hand of Jesus Christ grabbing our hand and pulling us out the first part of redemption though the first part of it is paying the price the Kinsmen Redeemer a Boaz Redemption is all through the Book of Ruth if you want to read it Boaz you had to have three things he had to be able to pay the price to redeem Ruth he had to be willing to pay the price can you say amen and he had to be a Kinsmen Redeemer three things Christ became our Kinsmen Redeemer he became us he had to be willing to pay the price and he said in the garden not my will but thine be done but then he had to be able to bring the right price to redeem you and I'm here to tell you this morning there had to be a debt that's the first part of redemption there had to be a sacrifice to meet the dead and he went to Calvary nobody knew what he was doing nobody knew he was going to deal with the problem and when Jesus come up 12 years old or that he knew his commission and he knew in three and a half years he was headed right for that sacrifice that's why he was there nobody knew that matter of fact his disciples were so dumb to it at the end they're trying to keep it from happening can you imagine he's going to deal with their problem of sin he's they're trying to keep him from going that's how man can't understand when God deals with the problem let him deal with it don't question him don't say oh no Lord don't go from us and don't know do you realize Peter and you what you're doing he's headed and he's headed right there his commission is I'm going to pay the price this is the moment that I'm gonna he's gonna bruise my heel but I'm gonna crush his head from my people I'm going to save my sons and daughters I'm going to release their debt from them you you owed every bit of the sin that you owed every bit of that you've done you should pay for everything that you've done can I get people to raise your hands this morning it should come back on you but somebody walk the way the Via Dolorosa called the way of Calvary and he kept going and he kept going and he kept going because he knew what he was doing I'm I'm going to take care of the debt I'm going to write the check thank you for watching our message today if you would like
