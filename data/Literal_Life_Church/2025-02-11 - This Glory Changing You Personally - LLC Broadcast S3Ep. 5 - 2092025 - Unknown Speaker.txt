I'm calling you Jes Jesus trust you Jesus love you I'm calling [Music] youus done it before here we are Lord jus J I'm calling you we need you [Music] Jesus Deuteronomy 30 and verse 11 if you read with me for this commandment which I command thee this day it is not hidden from thee neither is it far off now wonder why he had to say that this commandment and this word that's come from God from Heaven to his people it's not far from you why would he have to say that because people begin to feel like it's a far off it's unreachable how many has ever felt like that I just feel like I'm a I'm aloner and this is the things that's being preached is it's unreachable to me God see how many you ever felt like God is just so far away from me and so this word that he said he's given he said I I want to let you know that it's not hidden it's not hidden and neither is it far off goes on to say it is not in heaven it is not in heaven that thou should us say who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it you don't have to do that who's going to go up to heaven and bring it down because that had already happened here when God sent his word through Moses and brought the word to the people then he says neither is it beyond the sea that thou should us say who shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it so the theme is is that don't let the devil tell you that it's so far away from you God has brought it close and it's closer to you than you think in other words my theme today God does not want these things to be distant from you he wants to bring it personal to you how close is it verse 14 but the word is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth M and in thy heart that's pretty close and if it's not there today then he's letting you know that's where he wants us to be he wants the word to be in your mouth and in your heart it's nigh thee in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou mayest do it I have one more scripture in the New Testament in 2 Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 18 but we all with open face beholding as in a GL last the glory of the Lord this also speaks of a pretty close relationship it's not distance it's open face it's face to face can you say Amen we all with open face beholding is in the glass the glory of the Lord what happens are changed into the same image from glory to glory notice it doesn't say a one-time event of being changed one night at an altar but we are constantly changed as we're looking in his face we're constantly changed from glory to glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord I believe in change I believe we can keep changing and it's by staying with our face in the face of Jesus Christ people think that they're more connected today because of social media they think that I'm more connected with people than I ever have been in my life because of social media I want to let you know that's not completely a true connection that's not a face-to-face connection and actually culture trains us to be that way that we start to believe that that's a connection and people con are convinced that they're more connected than they've ever been with social media but we're not really connected we're actually less connected than we've ever been relationships are suffering and relationships are going AR because we think that we're connected because we're on our phone connected with the whole world but you're not really connected it's really deceiving us into thinking that we're connected when we're when we're by ourselves we're we're by ourselves with our phone and we we're deceived into thinking that we're we're connected that way uh and and it's it's it's that somehow that we're connected to the cyber world so we're connected and none of it is fa to face so that that can teach us that because we are at church uh sometimes we feel like we're personally corrected connected to Christ just because we're at church doesn't mean we're connected this morning I might say some things that offend you but just give me a chance here and just think about it because I like to talk about what's really real there could be a possibility that you could be in church but not be connected and culture has kind of made us that way to where we we have a slot and we do something it's got to be pretty quick I have a hard time preaching for an hour an hour and a half because we're we we're in a generation of add attention and deficit disorder we've been taught to have everything quick and so we've got it done we've got a certain time for church we got to get going and so it's difficult we see now we're being taught to be that way we're being cultured into that way and as I've said before it doesn't work with the Bible or the scripture because it the Bible says be still and know that I'm God be still and know God how many want to know God this morning you're going to have to learn how to be still to take some time and listen to his voice the Bible says they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength anybody want to have new Strength this morning well it doesn't come quick we have to wait upon the Lord so all this culture that we get is completely contrary with connecting with this Christ I think ought to tell the truth about it because we all fall under this uh cultural wave that we're in so we just because we're in church doesn't mean we're connected because we have a Bible app on our phone does not mean we're connected that you're connected with your friends from camp on your phone doesn't mean you're connected does not mean you're connected with Christ and and and we we went from you know I was thinking last night we've gone from Deep face- tace conversations spiritual conversation you know when we didn't have our phones before and didn't have all this we went from Deep face-to-face conversations we then we went to texting and then we moved to FaceTime what is that face time it's not really FaceTime we move to FaceTime then we move to chats just chats and everybody everybody notice how we're moving now from something that's lengthy and a meaningful deep conversation I only have time for just a chat go ahead go ahead and be quiet if you want to culture is moving us into this and that wasn't enough you know that's next Snapchat not just a chat but it has to be a Snapchat it has to be quicker because I don't have time I just want to have flash a picture show me what you're doing I'll show you what I'm doing I'm on to the next thing Snapchat in this world there's an attack on time for relationships because relationships take time let's start with our relationship with the Lord relationships take time and we're being robbed of our time for things that really don't matter but what's what's suffering relationship our relationship with the Lord is we're not connecting with the Lord like we should we're not connecting with our children like we should we're not connecting with our families we don't have to do it and and and it comes as I said to to a Snapchat these these them these names that they give stuff really say something sometimes and we don't pick up on it but it's it's really saying where we're going can you imagine a Snapchat my wife H me up this week with it I was begging her please don't don't put that on my phone but some of the family pictures come up on there and I've had it for a week and I'm when I get home today I'm asking her to take it off I'm sick and tired of it it's not how I want to function cuz I feel this nervousness already these alerts coming every few minutes just from my family I won't let anybody else on there just from just about what do we have t 10 family members now I don't know what it is and it's just like bang bang bang bang please honey please take it off of my phone I can't keep up with my taex so I stepping back I'm not being critical if you have that you're still a Christian Maybe but but listen you know we can laugh about it but we have to be Discerning Christians we can't just swallow all this like the rest of the world does right because their relationships are hurting we have the Lord to call on for relationships but their relationships are really the highest divorce rate we ever had people with all kinds of abuse all kinds of things there's no connection whatsoever fathers to children and marriages and all these other things and you're going to tell me that that doesn't have uh that doesn't have a association with it that somehow it's teaching us that the relationship I don't have the time to put into it I'm on to the next thing don't tell me it's not related it is related and we need to be Discerning Christians can you say Amen in this world there's an attack on time for relationship and the same people who are incredibly connected to the whole world on their phone are the same ones sometimes saying they've never been more lonely oh tell the truth brother Paul the same ones that say they're more connected than they've ever been are experiencing loneliness and some of them depression now how can you be connected with everybody around the world and have that well some other reasons for depressions come but I can tell you sometimes they scientifically is associated with social media more depressed people than we've ever had but they say they're connected it's because it's not a true connection and I wonder if all of this makes us very shallow people instead of the deep people we should be I can guarantee you Christ is not wanting a Snapchat chat relationship with you every now and then a quick prayer hey bro help me out I'm in need of help in this situation God does not want a Snapchat response from you God's wanting relationship with you God's wanting time with you can you say Amen lel' haris sang a song years ago and I've always been moved by the lyric he said in the verse there he was just waiting in our old familiar place an empty spot beside him where once I used to wait to be filled with strength and wisdom for the battles of the day I would have passed him by again if I didn't hear him say and the course goes I miss my time with you those moments together I need to be with you each day and it hurts me when you say you're too busy busy trying to serve me busy trying to serve the Lord but how can you serve me the Lord says when your spirit's empty there's a longing in my heart wanting more than just part of you it's true God says I miss my time with you second verse says what will I have to offer how can I truly care my efforts have no meaning when your presence isn't there that's right but you'll provide the power if I take time to pray I'll stay right here beside you and you'll never have to say I miss my time with you those moments together I need to be with you each day and it hurts me when you say you're too busy busy trying to serve me my heart is longing for more than just a part of you it's true God says I miss my time with you I just wish I could continue on in this because this is where we're at God has called us to the deepest relationship you know I refer to a term called the third poll and if you don't understand that on the broadcast or here today when I return when I refer to the third poll of Jesus ministry which is repeated again in the last days God had different levels and Jesus had different levels of a his ministry number one was a first part and it was healing last Sunday the brother John he brought it up and showed us that we are a three-part being and so the first poll dealt with physically in other words we're a body we're a spirit we're a soul the second part was our spirit and that was the second pole that was discernment Jesus healed the sick and then he discerned the thoughts and the intents of the heart but there was a third part it's the deepest place that Christ could go that third pole that third area it takes us deeper into a personal you know what the third pole is it's a personal it's a personal relationship with him it's a personal experience with the supernatural God and it's not just the one time at the altar event it's a constant change from glory to glory that's as we're close to him face to face how many this morning want a face to-face relationship with Christ how many would like to exit some of these things that we're so bought into that's making us everything has to be quick and and puff potatoes and quick this and fast food and going in and out we've got to realize listen this is doing damage to the way we look at God and the way we look at relationships how many wants a FaceTime relationship with God a real FaceTime and not a Snapchat I don't want to have just a Snapchat every morning with my Lord I want to take my Bible I want to look to the word I say Lord this is more important than anything else in my life you may not have time in the morning with your job but there has to be time that you not only spend with him but you have time to communicate with him and he has time to communicate with you every day through the day David said said blessed be the name of the Lord who daily Loth us with his benefits Jesus said give us this day our daily bread this isn't in every camp meeting you go back and get the Holy Ghost again every camp meeting you go through the prayer line again this is something more eternal than that it's something more consistent than that this isn't giving us this Daily Bread every year at camp or every Sunday at church give us this day our daily bread let me communicate with with him daily can you say Amen because the glory of God is wanting to change you personally and he gave unto Moses when he had made an end of communing with him on Mount Si two tables of testimony tables of stone written with the Finger of God verse chapter 32 and when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mountain the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron I'm going to read real quickly because I want to read a lot of this they gathered Aaron and said unto him up make us Gods which shall go before us for with as for this Moses the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt we what not what has become of him and Aaron said unto them break off the Golden Earrings which are in the ears of your wives of your sons and your daughters and bring them unto me and all the people break off the Golden Earrings and that were in their ears and brought them an A and and he received them at their hand and fashioned it with a Graven tool having it then mol uh made into a molten calf and they said these be thy Gods o Israel which brought thee out of the land of Egypt and when Aaron saw it he built an altar before it and Aaron made Proclamation and said tomorrow is a feast to the Lord I want everybody to notice it was God that chose a prophet to bring them out of Egypt and here the people said nah we don't need a prophet we'll come up off our own way here's the gods that brought us out of Egypt they rose up early in the morning and offered burn offerings and brought peace offerings and the people sat down to eat and to drink and Rose up to play it become a heathenistic sexual perversion even yeah amen I tell you you leave the word of God you open yourself to all kinds of spirits you serve other Idols you leave this word you leave the stability of a good church preaching the balance of the word of God you open your family to all kinds of spirits you'll serve other gods and the Lord said unto Moses go get thee down for thy people which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt they have corrupted themselves they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them they have made them a molten calf and have worshiped it and have sacrificed there unto and said these be thy Gods oh Israel which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt and the Lord said unto Moses he's still in the mountain I have seen this people and the Lord said unto Moses Moses up there and God said I have seen this people and behold it is a stiff necked people now friends the point I'm making is that this glorious event that God himself is going to descend in a mountain and bring his word to the people but that's not the end he's got a people to deal with that are stiff necked so the message isn't over until he deals with our stick stiff nakedness so this glory is going to have to go deeper than just having the tablets because the people's hearts aren't in a condition yet that glory in the word in the the opening of the word has to become personal to the people to deal with their hearts stiff necked Moses they're stiff necked which is means they're they're rebellious and they dig their heels in and I imagine if you think of a stick neck person they're not moving at all this is what God described as his people and the condition now therefore verse 10 let me alone that my wrath wrath May Wax Hot against them this is God speaking and that I might consume them and I will make of the a great nation he says I'll just destroy all of them this how angry God got I'll destroy all of them and I'll start over again that's God speaking and Moses besought the Lord his God and said Lord why do thy wrath Wax Hot against thy people Moses being a type of Christ had to remind God but this is your people which thou Hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with Mighty hand wherefore should the Egyptians speak and say for Mischief did he bring them out to slay them in the mountains to consume them from the face of the Earth turn from thy Fierce wrath and repent of this evil against thy people remember Abraham Isaac and Israel thy servants to whom thou swearest by thine own self Moses reminding God of all this history and said unto them I will multiply your seeds Lord remember your promise I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven and all this land that I have spoken of I I will give unto your seed and they shall inherit it forever and the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people and why did the Lord have to repent of this thought of evil to destroy his people cuz Mo Moses said this is your people I don't want to remind you this morning listen if you're a child of God then you can come under the judgments of God there's no way for God to completely send you to hell if you're a born again believer God may get even angry with you but you are his people you're his son you're his daughter and in this case Moses had to say but Lord look what the world's going to say I want to remind you this is your people and I don't care how much stiff necked they are I don't care how much their heart would wander away from you it doesn't matter how low they would go your Redemption has to pull them out because they're your people thank you for watching our service today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our website literall life. church and if you
