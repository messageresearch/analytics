so we're looking forward to april that's what we have planned ahead if you want to get those dates and set that time aside i know it'll be a a good time in the lord we're very very excited about it and uh the ministers we have several in our hearts to bring in this year um god has a fivefold ministry and we have many here in the church we're blessed with and we have also many around the world there's no way to get them all in but we just pray about it we feel led to have these brothers here coming up so we want to be able to just enjoy the good word of god from the different gifts god has provided for us god bless you let's just go to the word this morning and we're going to read three verses of scripture in psalms uh verse chapter one and verse one and you'll find this as the first section in your new devotional there and um i thought it was uh inspiring to start the year and i just want to speak today and preach a bit on the uh some new year's new year's revelations and i trust it'll be a blessing to you i trust you'll be encouraged and you'd be listening in i believe there'll be some things that'll be encouragement to you this morning and you give me your amens i'll feel them here and uh that would be great praise the lord so psalms chapter one and verse one blessed is the man blessed means that he's favored of god he's happy he's uh he's a blessed man of god blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful now we could say that he's not a blessed man if he chooses to walk in the council of the ungodly if he chooses to stand in the way of sinners nor if he chooses to sit in the seat of the scornful then we could say he's not really a blessed man he may be blessed financially or other ways but in god's eyes he's not blessed because he chooses to position himself to these influences so but the man who chooses and the woman that chooses to be away from these influences and under the influence of god then he's a blessed man goes on to say but his delight is in the law of the lord his delight his passion is in the word of god and in his law doth he meditate day and night day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper now friends that's a pretty powerful set of scriptures here and i believe it's a blessing to see whatever he doeth shall prosper praise the lord father may you bless the word today may the word go out to every heart lord and every soul that's hungry for you and i pray that lord you'll just direct our words to be to give a word in season for these lovely group of people who are listening in today god bless them lord for just falling after the guidelines of the deacons and we're we don't want to have to do this but father we know that you can touch hearts and anoint this word and i pray you'll do so lord people's lives may they just be changed by the word of god lord may we approach this year with such a fervor and a desire and a revival in our hearts lord with such a positive confession lord that you are in control and lord that no outside circumstances lord can ever depress us we're too blessed to be depressed we're too anointed to be disappointed i pray father that you'll lift us above the shadows and you encourage every art that's listening in today and even in the archive we just give it to you may you bless your word in jesus name amen praise the lord amen now i i just believe that these three scriptures and three verses here this morning in it we find a greater revelation than what we realize and in these scriptures that we read i believe that there is a great revelation of the place that a christian can live every day to be an overcomer how many want to be an overcomer that's what we're called to be in laodicea we're called to be over every age had overcomers and we're called to be an overcomer not just a survivor but an overcomer in this laodicean age and so i believe we have some keys and revelations here that gives us the keys to christian lives living every day being an overcomer to be uh insulated from the world uh to be isolated from the influences that come in our minds and i want to elaborate on that in our thought life and there's some different things here this morning because we can be insulated by the holy ghost we can be isolated from the influences of the mind and letting them to lodge within our thinking in our thought life and so we are we in the scripture here are typed as a tree and if you know your bible you know that that trees are a type of a man and trees are a type of christ because in the beginning in the genesis we find that god talks about the trees that's in the garden but we know that not all those trees were literal trees some of them were literal trees and some of them represented trees which trees represent man but also trees represented christ and in the garden we have the tree of life in the garden we have the tree of knowledge of good and evil and actually incidentally those trees end up being symbolic that the tree of life in the garden was a person the tree of knowledge and good and evil was a person so you can't look at it just through a carnal eyes when you look at the book of genesis but we find in the beginning god is speaking about trees in the garden and they were not all literal trees and then if you move to the middle of the bible we see that the tree of life was a person that we eat of in the middle of the bible jesus was saying i am the bread of the life i am the way of life i am the tree of life in john 15 he refers to himself as the vine and you are the branches so so jesus is saying you are connected to this tree of life you are the branches to this tree of life i'm the vine you are the branches and any and we're in not engrafted but we're part of this tree so my theme is that the reason that he speaks about in psalms 1 is a tree a man is like a tree planted by the rivers of living water because men type trees and and we can even bear the fruit of something of the world or we can be connected to the tree of life and your life becomes a tree of life your life bears fruit of christ can you say amen praise the lord so then we see that at the end time then we give the middle of the bible the beginning of the bible but at the end time the prophet comes and preaches the bride tree and he says the bride tree that was in the in the early church got destroyed and the leaves fell off and uh and it and satan ate it down to the very almost to the roots but he said in the end time i will restore saith the lord what's god restoring he's restoring a bride tree and he has done that and he's almost finished with his restoration so all of these types type the bride and type you as an individual as a tree that is to bear the fruit not of your own life and your own selfish desires but to bear the fruit of christ in our lives how many want to bear the fruit of christ and the word that he gives us is there's a reason he gives this word not just that you intellectually accept it but you actually become a tree that's bearing the fruit in your generation in your season so now we see that the reason the prophet preached bride tree the bride is this tree collectively the bride is this tree but you are a tree individually and you're called to bear the fruit of the message of your day just laying some foundational points so we understand where we're going so then we see that when it says that he shall bear his fruit in his season it's him that we bear and when it says in his season his fruit in his season there is a fruit for a particular season not for another day there's a word for every day there's a word to manifest that's god's fruit for that day not the fruit we're not bearing the fruit of luther's day we're not bearing the fruit of wesley's day but in the season we're not even bearing the fruit of pentecost people often emphasize these different things and they're trying to produce the fruit of luther's day trying to produce the fruit of wesley's day and sanctification all that is part of the word but then you have people emphasizing that we're supposed to see the fruit of pentecost we're moved beyond that although we have all that restoration we're not emphasizing let me see the fruits of of azusa street and pentecost no no no we've moved beyond because we're in a different season we're in a different time and this scripture says this man of god this brother and sister of god this believer whether man or woman if they're a believer they'll bear his fruit in his season not their own fruit not the fruit of another season but the message fruits for this day the word of this day the word of this hour the fruits of the message i'll tell you let god see the fruits of this message coming from our lives not some type of baptist creed fruit not just a something like that but the fruit for this season god sent his word for this season and we are the trees that bear the fruit for the fruit for the season for the for the for the godliness for the word that he wanted to proclaim for this hour and i'm just excited about i believe that we're called to bear the fruit of the message of our day thank god for ones who are bearing the fruit that they have but don't get stuck in just bearing the fruit of pentecost we're beyond that we're beyond that people get get sticky when you say we're beyond pentecost but we are the brother brahman says the word that fell on the day of pentecost the word that fell on the day of pentecost will not work for this day we're under a different word we're inspired by a different word the last day's message so we're not just to bear the fruit of something back then but even more so today the fruit of spirit-filled lives personal revival in our lives that's what god's called us to it's his fruit that we bear in his season can you say praise the lord amen i can hear you saying it there so now to summarize just this foundation that i lay laying here this is a believer who's been planted in the right place beside the flowing rivers and waters of god this is a believer i'm summarizing now what i'm going to preach the rest of the time and then so but don't just hear the summary and then turn off the computer don't do that you should hear the rest of it but i'm summarizing that these three scriptures say that this is a believer who's been planted in the right place beside the flowing waters of god his life is planted in the right place his roots are going in the right place in the right position he has shut off all wrong influences he has one main passion in his life and that's the word of god and he is prospering both naturally and spiritually because it says whatsoever this man does is gonna prosper praise god i don't want the world's prosperity i don't want the success of the world remember he said to joshua if you'll follow these things joshua 1 he said thou shalt have good success not just success but you'll have good success in the year 2022 i want to ask you do you want the success of the world do you want the money of the world do you want what they call success or do you want good success and good success is when you and your family are following the word of god obedient to the word of god serving him with god in in the passion for the word and then you have not just success but good success not just prosperity but good prosperity god's prosperity god's blessing in your life hallelujah praise me to god so this is a believer that's been planted in the right place has shut off all wrong influences has one main passion in the word and is prospering both naturally and spiritually we're talking about your spiritual life your tree i asked you today where is your tree planted what influence are you under right now you better take a look at that for you for the year 2022 what influence is your mind under what influence is your thought life under where are you planted and what influence are you under you know planting and caring for plants and trees is actually an art and some people are actually gifted with it but then some people can learn i just bought my daughter uh some plant books my daughter and mariah for christmas i bought her because she's interested in learning more about planting i think she's really good at it good at it already she's really good at flowers and such but she wants to learn more because it's an actual art this guy i have no green thumb my thumbs are not green at all i do not do good at planning and matter of fact my wife gets on me because i'm usually with the roundup around trying to get the weeds around things and a few times i've sprayed some really good plants and that doesn't go over well with the wife so you know i just attack the weeds but if i get into the planting thing that thing is not going to thrive under me i'm just not gifted at it but we know the simple fact that a tree and a plant we know that i know this is simple today but i pray that you'll apply it to your lives a tree or a plant cannot thrive if it's planted in the wrong atmosphere your life no matter how much love of god you have no no matter how much you're lining up with the outside of the message no matter how much you're going to a message church or wherever you go to church your life is a tree and where you're planted every day spiritually will determine your thriving as a as a tree of the lord it has everything to do with it you can't say no that has nothing to do with it and what i feed on has nothing to do with it then you're denying what nature says unless a tree is planted in the right place it will not thrive you're divine denying all of nature and you're saying that my life doesn't apply to that no he's he typed your life in psalms 1 as a tree and a man or a woman's life has to be planted close to the rivers of water for moisture can you say that for the right atmosphere can you say amen and if it's not there it's not going to be a thriving tree the wrong atmosphere and if it's there if it's planted in the wrong place it will not reach its full potential and i think there are believers who sometimes are not planted in the right place or positioned just right yet now i've watched this for years um i'm going to remind you something that brother branham said i'm trying to stay within my range here the pulpit not walk around the church because we don't have enough camera people here we just have one so i don't want to make their job harder but so i'm trying to be good up here but i'm excited today i'm excited about the word but but let me just remind you if you never heard brother brahm say this but he said israel was a good vine but she was planted in the wrong place and when he was referring to that he met when they were in egypt for 400 years israel was a good vine she was just planted in the wrong place israel was a good vine she was a good plant but israel could never thrive in egypt israel no matter how good a plant no matter how what she had predestinated in her she could never reach her full potential she was a good vine but she could never reach it while she was in egypt and that's why god comes and said let my people go i've got to get them you're not born to be here under bondage you're born to live in the promised land and that's the same with your life you're not born to be in certain atmosphere that's why a lot of you a lot of you have come from other churches and other denominations and things because you were a good vine but you were planted in the wrong place no don't disrespect to the to the different denominations and things but there's a calling today that's gone out it comes from revelations come out of her my people don't partake of the plagues all of that is of a religious nature and somehow somebody feels the call i've got to come out of this limited version of christ and i've got to come to the full truth and so you're a miniature good vine seed of god god's own children comes out of that come out of my heart my people and the reason they have to come out is they can't thrive spiritually under that atmosphere israel was a good vine but she was planted in the wrong place and i find sometimes people are tremendous people tremendously love god want to grow in god i find teenagers they want to grow they they want to they want to balance they want guidelines they want to hear practical truth teach to them they want the right atmosphere sometimes in our church for years and they end up backsliding or they end up this because why they're a good vine but they're planted in the wrong church they're planting so there was an exodus to come out of wrong atmospheres to come to the right type of atmosphere why so i can grow so i can thrive can you say amen they were planted in the wrong place so there was a whole 2 million of them in egypt planted the wrong place but you do realize when they come into the wilderness for 40 years when they went into the promised land there were some that stayed in the wilderness and there were some that weren't called to go into the promised land when they went in there and said we're well able to take it josh josh and caleb but there was only two that went in either two million there was only two that went in there's only a few that were called and so i'm just saying this to say that now there there was only ones called some state in the wilderness some were just called to stay there they were planted fine there but some could not stay in the wilderness they were to go on and be planted within their promised land and that's where they begin to thrive under the joshua commission is where believers that's the only place they'll thrive those that are spiritual know what i'm talking about you know the word that changed from the moses commission to the joshua there's a change in this message from the prophet to the promise from the prophet to the prophecy amen there's been a change in this message to go from the prophet moses the prophet of this day into the prophecy which is our individual inheritance and what christ has given us and many people that are staying in churches that the emphasis is the prophet are dying spiritually because you haven't come into your promised land yet i say that respectfully i say that with all respect to this message of the hour that god has sent us but there are influences to try to send us back to listening and looking at those things and just looking at what happened in the past but we're moving on and people are drying up and dying because why you're in the wrong atmosphere you're planted in the wrong place you're meant for more you have more potentials praise the lord you've got more potentials in your life but it might be that you're just planted in the wrong place god bless you my christian friend i pray god will lead your heart that if you're in the wrong spot that you take your life and plant it in an atmosphere that you can grow glory be to god and then there was a small group that was planted in the wrong place in the wilderness they never could thrive but once caleb and joshua cru that crew were planted in the promised land they began to thrive bear the fruit of god the thing that god was finally looking for and that was faith to take the land under the joshua commission we're under the joshua commission today you have been you have to be planted in the right place to thrive even the church that you attend can make you grow and thrive in this word or shrivel up and die even the local church that you attend can either make you grow in the word and faith in the word in your position in the word or you can sit there and dry up and shrivel and die you better pray about what you need in your life so through the message coming in the last days i've been saying this last couple sundays we didn't just receive books and tapes we received a kingdom and so i want to make a couple statements about the kingdom we received a kingdom so now the word of god and what god sends his kingdom when he came 2000 years ago i said in that baby they didn't know what they were receiving but they were receiving a whole new kingdom the kingdom of god was coming through that baby it wasn't just a little baby but the whole kingdom of god was coming to earth again and so now when god sends his message in the last days especially we receive a kingdom which cannot be removed we received a kingdom we didn't receive do's and don'ts we didn't receive just another law we didn't receive a code to live by we didn't receive another movement to make another denomination and make another thing that i'm a part of this movement we receive the kingdom of god to earth the message is the kingdom of god restored to us and his kingdom is already here his kingdom is already here and supposed to be in our hearts and his kingdom it's spiritually another realm and so now i'm jumping ahead to say his kingdom is a spiritually another realm to live in and you can live in the world of this kingdom now or you can live on the outside of it every day it's a kingdom it's an atmosphere it's a sphere it's a it's a it's it's we can live in it i'm going to get to some quotes in a minute that'll show that but you see now we can live in the world of his kingdom or we can live outside of it it's your choice we can live outside of it influenced by ungodly people by sinners by critical people or influenced by borderline believers in the message even but sometimes you can be in the message but not positioned in the kingdom of this message i'm going to say that again sometimes you can be around the message but you're not positioned in the kingdom of this message sometimes you're in the movement but you have to be you're living in the kingdom because this is a kingdom i'm going to get to the quote in a minute it says jesus lived in a world to himself while he was walking around the world and sinners everything else he lived in a world to himself what was that world it was the kingdom of god he was living in that every day and that's what we're called to live in a kingdom to ourselves can you say amen praise the lord so now it's a kingdom we must live in position in the kingdom of this message not just the message but in the kingdom in his spiritual atmosphere in the inner veil can you say amen and in the message perfect faith without which i'll refer to some things here he brother branham is pointing us in the message perfectly notice the title not just any faith now not just a limited faith but perfect faith he's pointing us to perfect faith he's pointing us to more faith perfect faith so what we should desire is more faith how many raise your hands i need more faith yes and so it's interesting though in this message of perfect faith he's going to point us to a life of perfect faith but it's interesting that he did not point us to get that he didn't point us to more fasting he didn't point us to more prayer can't find it he didn't point us to a certain amount of time that we have to spend in the word every day can't find it now are all those things important of course because you see you have to those things help us to be in the atmosphere of god they help us to read the word we come into his atmosphere helps us to get revelation and then is it important to fast of course it's important to fast it is important to pray of course should we pray more of course we should but it never should be a thing and he never pointed us that this i'm gonna read to you what he said that brings us into more perfect faith and it wasn't fasting it wasn't more prayer i'll tell you in this day we can't pray enough but there's no rules i told a sister this the other day just trying to encourage her that we don't have any rules set to us to how much time every day we should spend in the word thankfully because i'd never be able to properly to measure up to it god doesn't send out a bunch of rules you have to send this amount of time and if we were to pay a tithe of our time it would be about two hours and 40 minutes a day 24-hour day how many of you are spending 2 hours and 40 minutes a day specifically in prayer or reading the word so we're glad that there's not some set of rules this is a thing that's built on passion i want to be with the lord i want to fellowship with him and if we get into this catholic mode of you have to do a certain amount of thing and you have to do penance we don't believe in penance here we don't believe in paying back for our sins we don't be of certain measures i messed up and made a mistake so i need to spend extra time in the bible today we don't believe in that stuff god doesn't set those rules so in perfect faith he doesn't point to more fasting and more prayer and all although we should do those things but how do we get to a more perfect faith how do we come to perfect faith he doesn't mention incidentally he doesn't mention in that message that we should push play more he doesn't mention that you would think in the message perfect faith he would say we need to push the tapes we need to push play more and that's how we'll come into more perfect faith he doesn't mention that even though that we know that that laying within the message god gave us we believe there's rapturing faith in there and that we should push play and that we should read the word of god but when he's talking about perfect faith i'm going to give you some of the things and it's not specifically what we do to push play these things i'll give you the things he talked about because in that message he doesn't bring that up if we push play all at the same time at a perfect hour of the day listen not once in this message perfect faith did he mention to just that that we'll come to more perfect faith by having house meetings and listening to the tapes together he doesn't see that praise the lord don't hate me but i'm just trying to point you if we have a message called perfect faith then why wasn't the emphasis that's how we'll all come to it no no i'll give you the things that he said that you read the message you listen to it what he says how we come to perfect faith gather together gather in fellowship for prayer but you could do all that and still not come to perfect faith you could do all that and not come to rapturing faith in fact if i jump right to the end and and uh you guys don't have that this particular quote i jumped right at the end of perfect faith i have some other ones but you don't have that one up here if you jump to the end of perfect faith you know what it comes down to at the end of it is knowing how much god loves us and that love reaches back to him he says that creates a perfect faith okay it wasn't our how much we spend in the word it was knowing how much that god loves us has an effect on us and that love because love produces more faith faith and love work together like faith like uh works and faith he says and when we were sinners alienated without god in the world in the muck of mud as i talked about this morning god come to us god sought you never you never saw god no man can come to me except the father draws him first and god came down in that muck what were you and you and sought you out and brought you out that ought to create a perfect love look what you was and look what you are are you listening this morning he's he's showing us the channel to be in the path in order to come to realizing more perfect faith and that is is that look what god look what you was and look what you are i shared this with a sister the other day years ago we had a new couple come in the church and god transformed their lives it was so tremendous he serves at a deacon and another church a faithful couple to this message filled with the holy spirit and when she first come to the lord in our assembly we went we attended a certain camp meeting and i didn't intend on sharing this but i trust it'll be a blessing to you but i knew as a pastor as though meetings went on she began to be troubled and never seen her try to see joy in her heart join her eyes her husband and her had been set free from so many things but through the week she started to get burdened she was crying she come to you she said i'm just so burned i just don't know if i have the holy ghost i don't think i have anything and she's going on and she and and i say this respectfully but through some of the preaching it actually left the impression and it took everything away from her that god had already given her if you if you do this you don't have the holy ghost if you do this we have to we have to make sure we're on the word on those things cause she become defeated and so god just led me at that very moment as a pastor to just share this with her i said sister i said look in your you and your husband's lives the last three months only three months they'd come to the lord i said look at the change look at the transformation look how you've come from the things of the world you've come to god and you've come to this end time message look at the transformation i said sis who did that work in the last three months in your life and she said it has to be the holy spirit and i said sis if you know that this isn't some intellectual thing that the holy spirit's done that much work then you can have confidence that if you're lacking something if you still need something holy spirit stay with what god is giving you be thankful and stay in that flow because if you do lack something god is going to provide everything that you're lacking and i would rather instruct people that way than to have people constantly living in a constant fear that somehow i just don't have it now there's some people of course that don't have it and if you look enough to the word of god it's going to show you you lack something you need to hunger for more of god and you don't have the new birth yet but i don't like this of taking certain things of sanctification different things and that brings people under bondage i think when you're planted by the rivers of living water when your life is planted in the right place and you stay there and you're away from the influences you set yourself as a candidate to receive all that god has for you and if you're lacking the holy ghost there's things you can do to obey him and stay close to him he's gonna give you it's god's not standing back saying oh i just hold it back from him i'll hold the holy ghost back i keep god's not playing games like that god's not god's looking for a hunger in your heart and and jesus refers to it he says a father when he sees his child needs something would he not give that to his child when they ever have a need and he said so much more is the father wanting to give the holy ghost to his children god's not trying to hold it back from you you set yourself from the right atmosphere and you show your hunger to god say god i need more of you he'll finish the work in you he'll steal you by the holy ghost so but look at this love look at this love look at the time right now 1209. no don't look at the time i got plenty of time look at the perfect love he says what were you i pray you're listening to me so he says that look at your life uh he says he said no man can come to me except the father draws him first and god came down in that muck what you were and sought you out and brought you out that ought to create a perfect love look what you was and then look what you are what did that somebody that loves you can't you have faith in what you are what did that somebody that loves you can't you have faith in what he's promised you then real genuine love will create a confidence in his word he caught me when i was nothing i'm still nothing but i'm in his hand you see he caught me he loved me when i was unlovable he loved you when he was unlovable but he changed me just like the colored sister that said one time in her testimony she said i'm not what i ought to be and i'm not what i want to be then i'm not what i used to be and she knowed she had come from somewhere something happened and that's the way it is if god when i was an alien from him so loved me till he stooped down to get me and pick me up that gives me confidence that he wants to use me he's got a purpose in doing it he's seen something in me he's seen something in you he had a reason to save you look at the people that's unsaved today look at the millions he could have took beside you but he took you amen no one can take your place amen you're in god's economy no one can do it that's his love to you then won't your love reach back to him and there's a love affair no matter what the situation is its circumstances is governed by this love that creates faith that god loves you listen now that the subject is perfect faith how do we get to it to know that god loves you and that you love god and you love one another and that brings faith he didn't say fast for 40 days you've got to have a revelation to know how much god loves you and then that love reaches back to him and that love governs every situation in life i'll read it later perfect faith masters every circumstance that's why we need to live in perfect faith but where does it come where does it start a perfect love a genuine love knowing that god loves us knowing that he's called us knowing that he has whatever we need and this governs and and that god loves you you love god you love one another and that brings faith a revelation of the love of god loving him back is the creator of this perfect faith in our lives it's rooted in the love of god not in works not in just wearing the right thing not in doing perfect things no we need a perfect faith and that doesn't necessarily necessarily mean doing perfect things it's a life that loves him and others more than anything and what he pointed to in the beginning of the message then is a position so now i'm going to the beginning of perfect faith with some other things he points to to bring this perfect faith well he refers to jesus and jesus jesus had perfect faith because he knew his position he was positioned right because he knew his position and this created perfect faith so uh so so now what he pointed to was our position knowing our position then many times in the message brother branham read ephesians 1 that has the term he's blessed us together in heavenly places so now you have our text that says this man this blessed man this godly man is planted in the right place beside the rivers of water then uh ephesians 1 says we're we're in we're heavenly places it's our position and brother bram says no what is the heavenly places it's the believer's position in christ it's knowing your position that brings perfect faith heavenly places are not a feeling or a sensation even though i felt the feeling of god i felt his presence i felt it in my flesh i felt it in my soul my spirit but heavenly places is not just a feeling or that type of atmosphere it's the believer's place and position in christ heavenly places is your position and so all this is about where you're planting your position then in psalms 92 12 he said the righteous shall flourish like the palm tree he shall grow like a cedar in lebanon those that be planted in the house of the lord shall flourish in the courts of our god i don't know if they have that scripture but psalms 92 12 the righteous shall flourish like a palm tree he shall grow like a cedar in lebanon those that be planted in the house of the lord shall flourish in the courts of our god they shall shall still bring forth fruit in old age they shall be fat and flourishing this goes right with psalms 1. it's those that are planted you have to be planted in the right place you have to know your position heavenly places in christ so many scriptures point to this position being in the right place being planted in the right place that's what perfect faith that's the perfect faith that we're called to you can have your faith built up temporary by testimonies a preacher can give testimonies and build faith that was our faith was built by brother baby sharing testimonies of god's supernatural power you can have your faith built up temporary by testimonies or by hearing the word faith coming by hearing the word all those things are wonderful but i'm talking about staying in your position and not having a temporary faith but a perfect faith that is stable that is planted when you use the word planted that means it's planted the roots are down it's there it's not rooting it up and moving constantly you can't spiritually do that and thrive well i'm kind of tired of this so i'm just going to do this for a few years and you root yourself up and no the the the plant has to be in one place and stay in that place this is the faith that i'm talking about knowing your position being planted in your position staying there not up and down but planted perfect faith and it's related to your position he says in the message perfect faith if you have those quote now remember they had the word he's talking about the disciples the word was laid flesh and the word told them i give you power amen just checking is the streaming working better now with everybody everything's clear okay good praise lord we have this recorded correctly here so if you want to go back to the first part if it was stumbling around you can listen to it on the archive later i'm glad it's working though i can preach another hour right no just kidding we'll try to wrap it up we can wrap the rest of the rest up with wednesday night but i'm glad it's working for you we'll just try to find a few points here and and try wrapping up but listen i pray it's encouraging your heart for this coming year we want that perfect faith but we have to see what it is that puts us in a position to be living in that every day remember the disciples they had the word and the word was flesh then and the word told them i give you power amen i give you power and they had the power but the disciples they didn't have the faith to operate the word that was in them see what i mean but jesus had it he was the word he had faith that that what he said would happen he said oh bring him here how long will i suffer you he had faith with his power how did he he said i can do nothing of myself why jesus he relied upon what he was he relied in knowing that he was the word and he had faith in god who made him the word he was god and they was in him and that give him faith because he understood his huh what gave him faith because he understood his position and that position didn't change he lived in the realm of perfect faith because he knew where he stood in his position with god that creates faith and you stay in that you don't let thoughts of the enemy try to make you doubt that position it's not a movable position god calls you to it you're planted in it and it never changes that's the kind of life we got to live but you see now when he's saying the disciples didn't have this perfect faith he had it the distinction was listen he said the disciples had power jesus had given him power and they had the word he was their word made flesh they had the word made flesh and they had the power but they didn't have the individual faith to move the power how many message believers maybe are we talking about today that have the word have the message have the power available but they don't know their position they're uprooting their you know they're they're not planted in the right place they don't know their position i tell you i'm praying for a stability in the saints of god i'm praying for an adoption a stability a maturity i'm praying i'm looking for the character of the kingdom to come in the people not of this wishy-washy and one day you're saved and one day you're doubting you're saved let's find a stability in the word of god and know who we are that's when we can fight devils when we know our position and the disciples had power they had the word but they didn't have the faith to move the power jesus had perfect faith and he had it because he knew his position in the word and moving down the quote quickly and so he understood his position he know what he was because the scripture had said he was this and here every scripture tied in to prove that he was exactly what the scripture said he would be and he knew what he was therefore he relied upon what god had made him and if he did that then can't we rely upon what god has made us as believers these signs shall follow them that believe how many believe that this morning these signs shall follow the we don't follow the signs but the signs follow us that really truly believe this word we believe in our position in the word thus the signs will follow that's what he said about us them that believe that's me my name's in there paul lafontaine is in there them that believe i'm one of those i'm one of them amen he had faith in what he was and if you are a believer you have faith in what you are you are a believer and if you've got faith in god the bible says over here if our hearts condemn us then we can of faith but if our hearts don't condemn us then we can have faith we have confidence towards god i'm jumping ahead to the next quote now see he knew who he was therefore he had faith faith could produce when he knowed what he was now if he if you abide in me and my word in you then you know who you are ask what you will it'll be given to you wouldn't that be wonderful tonight if everybody come in that prayer line listen to this now because this is interesting in in this message perfect faith at the beginning he actually says why are you coming in the prayer line if you have perfect faith why don't you just believe in there why are you coming in the prayer line he actually he actually challenges the people that if you had perfect faith you wouldn't have to come in that prayer line i'm not that's not my quote that's what he said and yet later on the message he says if you come to the prayer line he's referring to coming through a prayer line okay but this is how you should come in the prayer line not of course not out of fear and not out of imagination because he said at the beginning of this message he said the faith i'm preaching to you tonight is not an imaginative to faith it's not just presuming something no it's an anchored that faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen god has showed me i'm going to be healed amen so now he refers so he's not against prayer lines but he's challenged and so many times people start to lean on prayer lines people start to lean if that happens if this preacher prays for me your faith needs to rise and elevate to a place that in your seat or in your home even right now god bless you faith strikes your heart through the word of god being praised i know who i am i know i'm a child of god every sin is underneath the blood and every promise in the book is mine you can have that right in your home right now you don't have to come through a prayer line and sometimes i just get concerned about pushing that again that that's the ultimate thing but here he says if you come he says wouldn't that be wonderful tonight if everybody come in that prayer line and say because he's got i think he's going to have one at the end of the service here's what you say i am a christian i have no condemnation i know that my heart condemns me not and something tells me that tonight's the end of my suffering that you're going to do it lord you're going to do it you'll go away here with something no matter how much now listen to what he says now so that's the way to approach it that's the faith to have that's how you come in a prayer line i know i'm a christian i know every sin is underneath the blood i have confidence there's not one thought satan can put in my mind that i don't deserve this healing that's not even you know there's a fella giglio and he just put out a book and he says he's saying what why uh remember giglio is the one who did the the universe some of the videos we watched of him doing the universe he just put out a book and he says why do you why do you let the enemy sit at your table and he takes the scripture in psalms 23 the lord is my shepherd i shall not want and then he ends that scripture of course you know what it says thou lord the shepherd you've prepared a table for me in the presence of mine enemies and he said he was saying now me if i was preparing a table for my people i'd do it in the presence of the king i would do it in god's presence i don't want to be around the enemy but god says i'll prepare you a table in the presence of thine enemies my what a powerful thing and it relates back of course to the mind and he was saying why are you letting the enemy or others a place at your table think about it why are you letting the enemy a place in you he doesn't belong at your table he doesn't belong in your thought life his thoughts are not considered you walk through that prayer line and say satan say you don't deserve this your thoughts satan aren't even considered i'm a christian god has promised this every sin is under the blood i stand here with confidence and i believe tonight god's going to do something for me that's the way to approach it didn't he say boldness before the throne of god humility but yet boldness we know who we are thou prepares the table in the presence of my enemies i could pre i preach on that a little bit wednesday night our thought life is meant to be a table of fellowship and our souls with god and god alone but you let others come to the table when they don't belong at the table you let other thoughts come and they don't even belong you got to cast them out casting down imagination in every high thing that exalteth itself above the knowledge of god he says then you're going to do you're going away with something no matter how much you come in emote now listen no matter how much you come in emotion now he's coming you come to the prayer line with just emotion a lot of people do this no matter how much you come in emotion how much you do it it won't work until that perfect faith has manifested and identified itself in you as a substance and when it's there there's nothing's going to shake you from it two approaches to a prayer line coming emotion an emotion will never do any good it's got to come by confident faith and then this last part says but jesus lived in a world that no one knew about known about he was an odd person he lived in a world of perfect faith and a perfect god in which he was if he lived in perfect faith of a christian to what we are we'd be a mystic to the world the people wouldn't understand you you'd walk in the spirit what the spirit said you would do what what it forbid you would you would do not do then the people begin to say you'd be a mystic person to them that's the way it is to all believers they're a mystic the people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves jesus lived in a world that nobody else could touch the disciples couldn't understand it when he spoke to them they they say this and they said that said and they said why you talking riddles we don't understand this how can this be see they wasn't in the world that he lived in i'm going to tell you believers congregation that same world that jesus lived in that same kingdom he lived in while he was standing there you're called to live in that kingdom you're called to live in that world to yourself psalms 1 1-3 expresses where that man is living where he's planted he's living in a world to himself uninfluenced by the council of the ungodly uninfluenced not in the way of sinners not in the seat of the scornful he's away from all that and he's planted by the rivers of living water you live in a world to yourself of perfect amen look what he says now he says and so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith i mean substance faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in christ there now you're getting into bride material you see you're getting into rapturing condition hallelujah that's what we want that means for each one of us not just the pastor deacons trustees that means for the laity every individual walks in a world with god alone you're baptized into his what into a kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and god you see he gives the orders you pack them out whatever he says there's not a shadow of doubt nowhere you walk right on if the lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it and that's the friends that's the the friends that's what psalms 1 is talking about he's living in a world planted by the rivers of water and there's no council of the ungolli that can talk them out of it there's no google can talk them out of it there's no influence by ones who've left the message could ever talk you out if you're planted in that place nobody can talk you out of it if you can be talked into something talk to into something you can be talked out of it this is deeper than that now you're coming into he says now nobody in the world can talk you out of it you go right on just the same you're going coming into perfect faith perfect perfection that cannot fail that fail faith never fails and the last quote says now notice another thing perfect faith is the master of all circumstances perfect faith masters i would ask you to lift your hand if you want this how many would like to live in a kingdom and a world every day this year that it masters every circumstance that comes your way i don't care if it's cancer i don't care if you don't know what's going to pay the bills next week i don't care if it's emotional i don't care if it's depression i don't care if it's panic attacks that you can live in a world that i know how to deal with this i've got a god that can deal with this perfect faith masters every circumstance how many raise your hand said i'd like to live in a world like that because i can't master every circumstance i can't do it in myself there's things that's out of my control but i tell you there's things that's in my control because i have god living in me but it's all about where you're positioned and planted and let me finish this when you believe anything do anything you've got faith in what you're doing no matter what the circumstance is that don't have one thing to do with it see it masters that circumstance now now i wanted to get into the practical side of our text and we might have to leave some of this for for wednesday night now what are we at twenty to one so let me try to find a place to wrap it up i hope this is a blessing to you i hope it's an encouragement how about build your faith i hope you set you in a path to come to a life of perfect faith why do you want to live another year in fear why do you want to live another year just not knowing who you are why do you want to continue to live on the fence about things why don't you be all in lock stock and barrel and i say god plant my life my tree plant my spiritual life right besides the rivers of water and lord let me shut out the things of the world and let me live there this year every day what a what a goal what a new year's revelation i'm just going to quickly make this simple as possible why is this man in psalms 1 blessed prospering thriving why is he thriving why is he prospering it's where he's positioned himself first thing in his mind he is not open to just any influence number one when you take the council of the ungodly you think this doesn't fit with social media and all the access we have to all the new wisdom of the world and all the thoughts that come across your mind every day and across your phone and this applies the counsel the example of the ungodly is set before us all the time advice everybody wants to give their advice and everybody's an expert everybody has the final word fauci biden trump the cdc act as if they have the final word and people get on with their opinions and they act as if they have the final word of it your opinion is not the final word my opinion is not the final word on it and so this whole thing of the council of the ungodly a believer says now wait a minute i'm going to close i'm going to have and this is the term brother braham says in perfect faith he he he gives a deaf ear a deaf ear to the other voices that's the term brother bram says a deaf ear you know the deaf ear is and this is you know children when they you hey johnny you know hey you know and they they show a deaf ear to mom and dad they intentionally do it so it can be done right that shows children show us that you can give a deaf ear and you're not really deaf but he says you give a deaf ear to the other voices and this believer in psalms 1 gives a deaf ear to the advice and counsel of anyone that's ungodly i'm getting practical now why are you given a place at the table to weigh in in your life from the council of the ungodly they have no example in their life they're not growing in the lord they're going backwards and you're giving a place at your table and your thought life to the council of the ungodly he's not following their advice he's not following their example he's not get living on google to google information for the decision he makes i don't make my decisions just based upon a google search i'm not following the dating habits of the the show friends that i watch all the time a believer is not looking to his cues to how to date just dirty shows that bring sex and things so dirty believers not following the dating habits of the show friends or jerry seinfeld or the big bang theory i only mention these very few things is because you say that doesn't have an influence on my life if i watch it but i'm here i already say it does have an influence and it's the council it's teaching you the counsel of the ungodly and you're watching it and listening to it say a lot more about it but he doesn't listen to the counsel of the ungodly i don't live on the advice of people who have left the message and formed their own life with what they want of the bible and what they want of the message if they want any of it i don't live on the advice of those people i don't look at the example of those people if this is some of your influence you will never grow to more faith this blessed believer is not influenced by those things he doesn't walk in the path of sinners to be in the path it's just to be around them it doesn't stand in the path of says he's standing he's around them he's watching what they're doing he's standing in the path he's not necessarily following them but he's just standing in the path watching what they're doing the path of sinners is that where your life is you're going to a message church but you're really just standing in the path of sinners on the internet and everybody else you're just standing there watching what do they do what fun are they having you're standing in the path of sinners you may not be going down the path but just standing there watching what they're doing not necessarily following but just standing watching what they do all day it's feeding on what they're doing i wonder what they're doing i wonder what's why but it's so much fun watching them do it just standing them watching them on their path which incidentally leads to a path to hell you don't want to watch people that aren't about to help nor in the seat of the scornful you know what i cannot take two minutes and talk about the seat of the scornful the mockers the scoffers the complainers the critical moping all the time finding what's wrong finding what's negative you associate yourself with people like that all the time you're not going to be positive about your walk with the lord you're not going to be positive so let's just leave this to wednesday night because i don't want to take two minutes on that part we need to talk about people that stand in the way of sinners we need to talk about people that dwell on the council of the ungodly and now you're sitting in the seat and this is you were standing in the way of sinners but now you're sitting in the seat of the scornful and if you don't think believers can sit there brother bram said himself i was sitting in the seat of the scornful one time when some pentecostals came into his church and they began to dance in his own church and he had a baptist background and that just didn't work he sat there he said i sat in the seat of the scornful criticizing these people getting out of order in church he was in the seat of the scornful so i want to elaborate on that of being around negative people and being around backsliders and being around people that are constantly negative that's not going to help you my brother that's not going to help your life they might even be in this church but it's not going to help you to stay around them if you can say an encouraging word and try to pull them out of it but most of the time you can't pull them out of it because they're just negative but you're not going to be in good shape if you hang around just those people all the time amen you're not going to be positive you're not going to have faith you're going to be confident in what god is doing you're not going to be a kingdom living in the kingdom when you're around the seat of the scornful and they just sit and criticize and they're they're constantly looking at things all the time from that perspective those people are not going to do you any good you're not going to prosper being around people like that may that be part of your new year's resolution revelation may that be part of your desire lord let me distance myself from influences that's plaguing my mind making me negative let me sit myself plant myself in the right place let's talk about that a little bit more in the next service let me jump ahead and say this blessed and happy and favored man or woman of god have intentionally positioned themselves away from people like that away from influences like that they have to in order to live in the kingdom and his passion his delight is in the word of god above anything else it's exciting to them they can't wait to get to church they can't wait to hear the word from the church they can't wait to open their bible they can't wait to read it it's not just reading it it's a passion for it this is this man in psalms 1. can you say amen and he doesn't let things get lodged in his mind it says he's not only not only does he have a passion for the law of god in the word of god but in that law he meditates day and night this is what he allows himself to think about all the time this is what he meditates about so i don't have a choice in some things i don't have control over some things but i want to tell everybody here i and you have control over our thought life see the devil's conviction you don't oh the devil is just bringing all these thoughts now you have control over you can replace good thoughts with wrong thoughts and you have to decide between what's imagination with satan's thoughts coming to you and quickly dismiss them not giving them a place at the table and say i'm going to replace it with perfect thoughts with good thoughts with wholesome thoughts think on these things and so i'm meditating on the word meditating what i heard sunday i'm not telling you what i heard wednesday night i read this yesterday in the bible just meditating on that this is the guy this is the brother this is the believer who's prospering it's a believer who's spiritually in a revival because he's not influenced by everything around him he switches out his thoughts back to the word he's thinking his thinking is directed his thought life is directed there are many things we don't have control over but he has control over what this man has control over what he thinks about praise the lord amen so much more here and i'm going to close it down you believe god has something for you this year you believe god has something deeper for you this this message is not just for a select few it's if you'll take a hold of it it's for you it's for you to live and revival it's for you to live in perfect faith brother brown wouldn't preach unless there have been a people that live in perfect faith a world to themselves unhindered by the things that's going on around him around them the world the conditions the the fear the the the pandemic the pandemic of fear the politicians who lie the lack of trust because if they're a politician ninety ninety percent of the time they're lying through their teeth they say one thing when they want a certain political agenda and the next time they say something completely opposite it angers me sometimes but listen i want to live out of that world sometimes people are so politically influenced more than what they realize because they're watching too much of the news but that's not the world we're called to live in we have a kingdom we're called to live in that kingdom we're called to keep our thoughts on that kingdom look at this fella look at your first devotion there that we sent as a gift to you gave us a gift to you if you haven't got it then we'll send it to you look at that first one and he talks about those just read that first one for the first of the year and then brother braham says in 1957 i think when the church gets real cold this is on the back of your devotional we gave you and i'm closing on this i think when the church gets real cold and indifferent god's sheep ought to kindle excuse me god she's about to kind of hollow up together and pray for each other and the warmth of good christian fellowship oh it means so much david spoke of it in the first psalm blessed is the man that seth not in the seat of the scornful standeth in the way of sinners but his delight is in the law of the lord and in the law doth he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree that's planted by the river water and his leaves shall not wither whatsoever he doeth it shall prosper i say blessed be the name of the lord that's my promise today if that's where i can live under this message that god has sent then i i want to live there i i didn't bring my goals up here and this afternoon i was supposed to talk about some goals with you and maybe we'll have a chance to do that at another time but i wish i had him to read something but i can tell you the main one that i wrote down is that i want to live in that world to myself and not be as affected by the voices and the negative the things that's around me i want to live in that inner world with the lord i want to live that perfect faith i don't want to keep losing sleep over things that really shouldn't have that much value to me i want to pray about things instead of worry about things i want to take it to the throne of god in prayer things that are emergencies we take it to god as we did today together for the needs of the congregation just got a request here christian slack that has a fever now so we're just going to pray for him and then there was another prayer request i believe that came in yeah solomon wanted to pray for lily as well who's not feeling well so if you would just stand there in your home and we'll go to prayer again and we're going to we're not going to worry we're not going to fear we have no fear i can tell you that though fear is being promoted i know that our leadership has said and i'm not afraid to say it because they've quoted themselves they said this will be a winner of death but i'm here to say to you if you lived in this place if you lived in this place in psalms 1 this will not be a winner of death it'll be a winter of life i'm here to not just predict but to tell you i can almost guarantee if you live in this place it'll be a winter of life and whatever comes my way if i get sick if i get covered if whatever happens if i should die did you know that really you're not going to die because christians don't die i'm helping some of you in your fear of death do you know that christians don't die do you know that they're anchored with the holy ghost that christians don't die did we forget that do you forget that paul says for me to live as christ and to die is actually gain if that don't deal with our fears i don't know what does you know why the world is under fear because they don't have that hope they don't have that revelation but i'm preaching to you new year's revelations and the revelations if to me to live is christ to die is gain its happiness its contentment its peace both ways we'll pray you out of any sickness there isn't any sickness too big for god we'll pray you out of it but i don't have any fear of death and this is not the winner of death this is not the winter of severe sickness i'm not claiming that this is the winter of life
