========================================

if you stand one more time we're going to read in joshua chapter 11. if you would read with me the text that we read last sunday we wanted to finish a few thoughts from that text joshua chapter 11. i certainly feel his presence here this morning amen i want to read here just one verse and verse 15 as the lord commanded moses his servant so did moses command joshua and so did joshua he left nothing undone of all the lord commanded moses if you turn with me in ephesians in the new testament which is where i want to preach out of today i want to bring it from the old testament to the new testament as we realize that brother branham said that our joshua chapter our joshua commission is in the book of ephesians that's our inheritance spiritually speaking ephesians chapter 1 and verse 18 the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints so now the book of joshua is the physical inheritance of israel and now here is our spiritual inheritance did you know you have a spiritual inheritance and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also it that which is to come and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church i want to read verse 22 again and hath put all things and i'd like you to remember back in joshua right where joshua left nothing undone all things that goes right with this because christ allows us to put all things under everybody say all things joshua left nothing undone and in our inheritance christ allows us to put all things under our feet and put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all and if he says his body is the fullness of him then we're part of that body there's christ living within us we are the fullness and so where is he putting the devil under his feet it's through the body of christ amen father bless your word we pray that you will anoint us we certainly are glad to know father that you're you're near us this morning we feel and sent you here i want to say thank you for the life of brother gary so many years he's serving this assembly and lord thank you lord that you chose father that he could go to his reward and in his days of suffering here in his mind battle as it was lord and i just pray father that you encourage his brother and sisters two brothers and his sister and all the family this morning as they grieve his loss and you pray you would encourage them lord and just in the coming days just be with them lord and all those who have lost their loved ones recently lord we pray that you will be a friend to the ones who need comfort we thank you lord in jesus name amen god bless you may be seated i sense in joshua a leader in a great commander in general of the army him being a type of the holy ghost that joshua is a good type in this way first that he's not afraid joshua was not afraid joshua was not afraid to go and root out the enemy in places maybe that he was hidden so i want to this morning take this a little bit deeper because if we just continue to talk about the old testament and what joshua did and him taking the land we can rejoice over that but we don't want to miss that it's all a shadow and type of your spiritual life right now and if we come to church and just rejoice over what happened in joshua it's not good enough we have to look at what it's saying to us and what it means especially when we know our land and our book and our inheritance has been given back to us when the seals were taken off in the last days this is a wonderful thing calvary purchased it but then the land came in the last days and gave it back to us again but joshua we can learn from was not afraid i want to take this deeper today and talk about things that are left undone talk about things that are left in our lives sometimes that uh we we ignore and and and yet if we ignore some things it may be an area that god wants us to overcome in its land that has been taken away from us and if we ignore it or we leave it undone we can't live to our full potential as a christian and so joshua's not afraid though and we can learn something is that we can't be afraid to go to the areas of our life that are uh not taken yet land that is not taken yet uh in in joshua in a few weeks we'll talk about it if we get to it but there's a scripture two or three chapters later after they had rested from the battle for a while then god says to joshua rised up again because he said there's still very much land to possess it's hard to believe that they battled that hard and then they rested and god says no there's still land to possess be up and going it's time to go so there's still land and in our lives if there's still land to possess we can't be afraid to go take those lands to take that part joshua wasn't afraid to root out the enemy joshua wasn't afraid to expose the enemy joshua was not afraid to go to the enemy if he be hidden somewhere he wasn't afraid and so may we all get that type of faith in our heart this morning to say i will not be afraid to root out the enemy if he's cheating me or taking something from me that's my spiritual inheritance i won't be afraid of them but the truth is about human beings sometimes we're afraid of certain areas we're afraid to talk about certain areas there are areas of our hearts sometimes that we've left alone for years and sometimes we just leave it alone but you see you you have to be willing to say i'm not afraid of anything because i will live in greater victory if i possess this part that the devil has used so many times i can't be afraid to possess that part too believers and bringing up what i did last sunday believers will not cast aside parts that they don't want or they don't want to follow real believers will rise up and they don't want to just cast aside and leave something undone as we said last sunday believers don't want to do it and believers say if it's important to god it's important to them if if god says that i can uh live victorious in this particular area whatever it is in my conversation in my thought life and if he says i can i'm going to keep claiming that until i get it can you say man i'm going to keep approaching that and especially if the enemy's trying to use something if it's important to god then it's important to the to believers to say it's in my inheritance everything in this bible particularly in the book of ephesians if you if we look at it like we look at it today our inheritance it is not just the soul that we possess but there are parts of our spirit and our body that are talked about in the bible and so we can't leave those parts out god wants us to have our vessel victorious before him can you say amen and uh and so believers don't want to leave anything out i want to thank as i was thinking about this these things i want to thank the women many of the women of our congregation i want to thank the older women for many of the older women for not leaving the modest parts of the word for not leaving them out or leaving them undone so i'm coming down real practical to say it's not just what we have on our soul but it's everything in the bible and the message that get to all of that they're trying but just taking care of them and just being a mother and loving them that is to be praised because you know what you're doing you're saying that part of the word will not be left undone i'm bringing that because that's part of my inheritance too that's part of my position can you say amen people want a position and mother's in the adoption series brother braham says we find our place in christ in the word but he says then what are you a farmer you're a mechanic whatever it is and he says you mothers with children that's a position in christ that you're fulfilling it's part of what god gave you and you're doing it well god bless you for doing it we are not it's not going unnoticed because you are saying to the world this is important because it's important to god and you're loving them and giving yourself to them every day until someday they're on their own and you can sit and have your coffee all morning long or go to cracker bell with your husband every friday night like we do there's a day coming sis we'll all change and the whole house will be quiet not a single thing move not even wait a minute getting into christmas poems now there's a day coming but guess what now your attention's not on a big career and leaving the home this that and the other god bless you for giving your attention to your family and children god bless you and we we thank you for it [Applause] god bless the young men that are leading their families and bringing them to church and teaching them the word of god and having that influence in life god bless you you're to be praised this morning god bless the young people that are not leaving things undone the young people we have some young people here that are rarities in this world they're just rare who who say that you know it's not the god's word says it's part of my inheritance not to fornicate or be with someone or touch one another physically before marriage or kiss one another until the wedding day that's part of my spiritual inheritance and there's some young people saying that's part of my inheritance and guess what i'm sticking with it i'm not leaving that part undone the rest of the world says it's not important i'm saying it's important we have young people sitting here that says it's important to god it's important to me we're going to do it praise the lord let's give them a hand too god bless you there's believers do not leave anything undone it's it's not just and to the mothers i mentioned and to the young people and the young married men and the young single men they're they're doing it and it's and it's not they're not just doing it because there's a quote necessarily they might know all the quotes and they might not know all the quotes but they're doing it you see they're leaving nothing undone they might not know all the things but but something in them is saying this is what i want to do and i want to fight for what god said is mine if i have a spiritual life as a young man i want to fight for that and it's a battle you don't think it's a battle for sisters to wear what they wear in the world they live in you don't think it's a battle with social media when other people calling themselves christians and sometimes message believers taking on the makeup and all these other things you don't think that's a battle an influence on a young one when that says well that's you got to do that to be pretty it's an absolute lie you don't have to do that to be pretty but it's a battle but guess what there's some saying listen but what does god's word say i want to be pleasing to the lord i want to be pleasing to my husband and so they're not looking for the cues there and many times they don't know all the quotes you don't have to know all the quotes and make this a religion you just got to say lord what is your will what is your will what's in your word i don't want to leave anything undone and i want to fight for what's mine can you say amen these are those under the joshua commission these are believers under the joshua commission and it is a fight but they are winning and some you know i know some have given up that fight and they still want to claim parts of the message the parts that they want but this group is to be thanked this morning and god gets glory in their lives because they want to leave nothing undone so want to tie together this morning all things under your feet and joshua leaving nothing undone it means completion it means joshua wanted to complete this he means he does not want to leave anything out there's a land there and there's an inheritance and i want all of it i want to possess that land i want to take that land for me and if nobody else does it i want to take that land and so we this breaks down to our inheritance in jesus christ it's easy to speak of joshua but we have to get down real plain about how we can leave certain things out and certain things undone and neglect certain things and we have to make this word applicable uh or we just don't we don't want to get to a place where we don't see this spiritual truth in this inheritance and the seals being revealed is not a part of our everyday battle in everyday life in our everyday victory can you say amen i want to remind you of a scripture i read last sunday in luke 11 42 but woe unto you pharisees for ye titheman and rue in all manner of herbs and passover judgment and the love of god these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone there's that word undone and so jesus said to the religious people you're doing something you're leaving lesser things undone and there are important things and you're leaving them alone you're you're ignoring them did you ever notice that the pharisees emphasized outward things like paying their tithes or what they wore how loud their prayers were and the love of god and judgment and things that are inward things they're leaving those things undone and religion will lean you towards outward things and leave inward things undone i'm taking my time because i want this to sink in real deep this i am preaching the joshua commission because you have a spiritual land and all of us have not conquered all of it yet we need to possess all of it and and so religion jesus is pointing out something about all pharisees and all ages is that they'll lean towards putting emphasis on things they think are important and leave little things undone but they're not little things they're important things they're inward things the love of god these things when people preach the message and leave the love of god out there's something desperately wrong with that that's a phariseeism can you say amen if there's no genuine victory in divine love then we're not preaching the message right it has to be rooted in divine love everything that you administer as a parent or as a pastor or whatever quote that you have that's going to get across to the people anything that you have that's the truth it must become from the root and the motive of divine love you need a victory in divine love before you apply the quotes i didn't mention it last sunday but the token is preached for years apply the token apply the token get this out of your house kick this out kick the tv out kick these other things and so so many years that's what was preached what to kick out and then he says apply it to your family and later they don't read the quote later that says when you go apply it apply it with such love that you believe it's going to get results i know a lot of homes and daddies that went in and applied it but there was no love when they applied it i know a lot of preachers that have preached this message and there was no love when they applied it there was no divine love there's no victory of divine love in that man's life to read the quotes to the people and if we do that it gets to be a religion can you say amen it turns into just making the people do something i believe the quotes with all of my heart but this thing according to first corinthians 13 must be rooted in divine love paul said if i have faith to move remove mountains he says and though i understand all the mysteries it means absolutely nothing without divine love this has to be rooted in a victory in divine love first and you get that through the filling of the holy ghost it's not just this worldly love you know mamzy pansy thing it's the holy ghost love it's christ and you get him on the inside and that's the motive for everything well here's a quote here's what i need to do but you do it out of love you don't do it because you're going to go to hell say i better do that my daddy taught me to do that my mommy told you i better do that and thank god for people who respect it even when they don't understand it they do it out of respect for their parents god will bless you for that sometimes people do out of respect for the pastor god bless you for that i appreciate that that's a good thing god will bless you for that but the motive needs to be the holy ghost love on the inside and the pharisees religion whatever age it is including in our ranks sometimes we make the message a religion because we emphasize the outside parts i should be getting a bigger amen than that because you know it's true i'm not dumping out or leaving undone any of the outside parts but if it goes with the motive without divine love it comes under pharisee and so when i read the book that says joshua that says he left nothing undone of all the land to be conquered i want to get specific here and say to you that i see when i read that because i bring it into my own life i see that i'm a three-part being and i see that i see that i need a hook to put my we got all this money in this place and no money for a hook just lay it over here i guess you know you get all this and you complain you know you complain that you don't have a little hook how spoiled we can get i thank god for what god has provided for us supernaturally amen sometimes you have to stick to take a moment because it's all still surreal to me it's it's i feel very humbled by all this and i don't want to emphasize the building and talk about all that as much but every once in a while you got to say boy we we didn't deserve all this but god really blessed us didn't he amen so quit talking about and just preach brother paul amen so you know religion will lean you and so when i see joshua saying he left nothing undone i see myself and i say all of us are a three part being we're not just a soul the reason i say this is because some people think that once the soul is saved and the soul is filled with the holy ghost that's it but you're leaving other parts undone and joshua didn't leave anything undone as a matter of fact the greatest battle is when we have a spirit and a mind and emotions and these things that the the biggest battle is when when god really comes in by the holy ghost and fills you in the soul level the desire for the world is gone there's a change in your life i heard someone say even a couple sundays ago something happened to them right in the service while the word was being preached and there was just a release of of all all things praise god he's still he's still doing the work friends don't think we had to wait to the altar call he can fill you right now he can fill you right now if you surrender say i'm ready to give up everything for christ it's all about him now just have a yielding heart that way god is moving can you say amen but we're a three-part being so when someone gets filled with the holy ghost there's two other parts that satan is left with to really damage and to really work in and we can't say as christians those parts aren't important we have to say that's land that we want to possess if you're still in ephesians chapter 2 because this is our inheritance chapter now encourage you to read the whole book of ephesians because he says in chapter 2 and verse 21 ephesians 2 and 21 in whom all the buildings fitly framed together growing unto a holy temple unto the lord now who's he talking about he's talking about the body of christ we're the temple but he's talking about your temple too other places in scripture he says that we're the temple of the holy ghost not just our soul but all of us we are a temple of the holy ghost all of your temple so does what you wear count yeah it counts right because this whole temple is the lord it's not just your soul see i got god in my soul but you know here he's smoking this cigarette now it doesn't work that way this is a building this is a holy temple unto the lord in whom we also are building together for a habitation of god through the spirit so in our inheritance now it's not just that we possess our soul or god possesses our soul but this whole temple becomes possessed by the lord and we take our land can you say amen if satan is trying to belittle us or take us in a certain area of our life we are a three-part being and it's not just the soul it's the whole temple of god in my short years on earth i see some things emphasized many times the glorious state of the soul and we've come to truth about that like no other people we preach it here we believe god has really revealed what the believer stands in as far as his standing with god being completely cleared in court and stands as a virtuous believer by the blood of jesus christ right now not coming someday you're not working your way into that you in your soul level you have been if you have the holy ghost you've passed judgment you won't stand at judge of the day you've passed from death unto life you are have been justified you have been sanctified you have been glorified and already sit in heavenly places with christ in the soul level boy that blows some people away that's the truth you're not trying to work your way towards that your soul is already in the presence of god amen that's the one and we preach that here but the problem is what i've seen is people so much preach the the the standing of their soul so many conventions preach so much about it but the other stuff is left undone and we then then eventually not everywhere but you get a pride which we can all get this that now that we're sealed in and we're predestinated before the foundation of the world and everything's cool everything's right case era i am as good as in the rapture i don't have to work my way to a rapture praise the lord what are you doing i'm just sitting here at the altar waiting for the rapture the problem with that you lose your fight you get a little loose and the devil says wow what a pride there i'm just gonna wreak havoc on this guy with temptation i'm just gonna bombard him i'm gonna get in his mind i'm gonna send him voices i'm gonna discourage i'm gonna do everything i can to cause him to make mistakes and everything because because this guy thinks it's all in the bag he's not going to fight me in any other area you don't think the devil's that smart i'll give him credit he's smart there is sometimes that he's real dumb like when he crucified the lord shouldn't have done that shouldn't have done it you never stop that now the devil is smart sometimes smarter than you is that you leave a larry in a hilaria an area uncovered or under you know this is not under the lord's headship he says okay i'll take it you let your mind wander nobody can see what you're thinking you let your mind wander mind water says okay there's all kinds of thoughts of all kinds of lustful things or whatever it is and depression and all kinds of fearful thoughts of what's possibly coming because you're leaving that un you say that's that's an un that's not no the bible says think on these things the bible is can you say man it's all the land that we possess and if the devil gets in we kick him out he and he will get in can you say he'll get in your thinking we don't talk about it often but i'll tell you a man is a man and the devil will really try to use images and things to get in the mind of a man we don't talk about it very much but you should talk about it with the lord you should get a good confident friend and you say we're going i'm going to i want to win this battle i don't want this private battle to go on and the devil's getting the best of me and you certainly don't want to say this that's up to me that's my oh my that's nobody that's nobody's business ah now the devil's got you in a piece of land that he's squatting on and you can't be free to worship the lord because you're bound by sexual demons so i'm starting to really relax now in the service and this may get very very personal because i'm not afraid of the devil and to talk about it there is some land in your life and you can't yield that land to the enemy you have to fight for it many times it's not your soul in most cases it's not the soul of people it's the emphasis in the message many times in other places has been the state of your soul that's where we have the movement of justification come out of luther's day and that swing from justification to sanctification because the way that in another restoration if it hadn't brought up the truth of sanctification then in justification people start doing any living any kind of life and say i'm going to heaven i'm justified luther preached it justified by faith justified by the lord and it's not nothing that i do so i don't have to do anything when it swings that way like it has sometimes in the message it's all about the predestination but there's nothing preached about the devil's binding people's lives in their hearts in their minds in their spirit there's nothing preached about it and we're in a battle now the soul is sealed in but we're in a battle to get to take all of our land brother boaz all the land everything not to leave anything undone is anybody understanding what i'm saying so we see that but we must take every part and not leave the mind or the heart or the spirit and so i have a quote here in power of transformation if you have the first quote there brother paul now that now that we have been we we tend to stop short of things okay but look what brother brahm says here now that we have been saved as we are and that we have been filled with the holy ghost as we have now now does anybody recognize a progression here now that we've been saved now we've been filled with the spirit that's it we're in we're done no now that we have saved now we've been filled holy as now now we want the mind that was in christ to be in us that we might be transformed changed transformed from the natural things of life and be brought in to do the perfect will of god by transformation of god's spirit by his word can you say amen praise the lord that explains it explains what i'm preaching better than i can preach and that is that now that we've been saved now that we've been filled with the holy ghost now we let the mind of christ that he changes us from the natural things of life i don't think he's talking about eating and natural things like that he's talking about a natural life mindset of things of the world or things that that are that we have in our thinking that needs to be purged out that we learn to think like god thinks so this is where we grow and this is where the land that we take is that lord if there's some natural things alive i want to be changed and transformed he goes on in the adoption message a little bit further he talks about back in 1960 and the possession that the promise that was given to the church this is the next quote and the possession that the promise that was given to the church is not a natural land but a spiritual land for we are a royal priesthood a holy nation then in this royal priesthood holy nation particular people peculiar people called out elected chosen set aside then all the world is dead on the outside and we are led by the spirit sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit of god not by man but by the spirit all in love the whole thing is bundled up now this has been tried to be taught on many times and no doubt what great theologians have struck it a lot deeper than what i could but the thing i want to try to get to you is this that a man that is in christ with the holy ghost can bear with a man when he's wrong long-suffering gentle patient he's sweet humble faithful filled with the spirit never negative always positive he's a different person i'm so glad that brother brahm says those things you know what it does it convicts all of us that we still have land to possess he just talked about the inheritance the spiritual land for people and guess what he's not talking about the soul he's talking about what the holy ghost in the soul starts to do right if he didn't just said you're saved you're predestinated it's done you're in the soul but he didn't he starts to talk about that a man that has this is long suffering is gentle he can bear with a man when he's wrong can you bear with somebody when they're wrong that's a good question can you bear with somebody when they're dead wrong or do you got to continue proving that they are wrong until they get on their knees and in sackcloth and ashes repent before you i was wrong until i hear those words i was a lot of people can't say that i was i was they can't say it well until you say it i'm not forgiving you i'm not bearing with you you're just wrong and i'm waiting for that but the holy ghost can bear with a person that's wrong you know why you can bear with it because you're wrong sometimes can i get an amen if you're taking an inheritance then it's part of this it's he can bear with a man that's wrong he can long suffering gentle patient he's sweet humble faithful filled with the spirit never negative always positive i could stop and preach a whole sermon to all of us about never being negative but to be positive just give me a minute and i'll think about whether i want to do it or not right now there's some land that i need to possess because we way too negative we speak way too negative we find the thing that's wrong and complain and criticize the negative things and we're always negative and we miss speaking about the positive amen he's never negative always positive he's a he's a different person praise the lord so in pointing to our book of ephesians here it's a very special book if you have your bibles open this is a very special book because brother brahma says ephesians parallels joshua so as joshua takes the people and they take their land what is talked about in ephesians is our spiritual inheritance it starts out with our position that we are in heavenly places in christ with all things under our feet because of christ what a revelation that is but as we come along in the book of ephesians we realize it's not all about the soul it's not all about being in a position in christ it's not affecting our everyday life and our our character it's not all about the soul if brother brahman says if he a man can bear with a man who's wrong that's more than just a soul that's that that man is it's how that man is acting towards others that's part of your land how that man is thinking towards others that's part of taking your land our thought life every day is part of taking our land our treatment of other people is part of taking our land it's not just that we have doctrine in this message and we have all the seals and we have all this thing and that's what we talk about and it's liberated the soul and all it's it's not just that's not a part the word opening the seals making off brought us as an entrance into this spiritual life it's the entrance into it but that of itself that i know what the first seal is doesn't guarantee that i'm living a character that's expressing jesus christ if it is a true revelation it brings you to your spiritual inheritance and you see your name in the book of life it's not just brother branham's name it's not just all the reformers it's not just your mom and dad but you see your name and your part in the book of life this is me this is my identity here's my land somebody showed me my land and now i'm gonna go fight for it and get it nobody else fights for your land except you teenager nobody else fights for your land not even your parents you get a grit about you say god's given me something he's given me a great rich heritage here or an inheritance and i'm gonna fight for it as a teenager i'm gonna fight for what's mine amen so we have it but we sometimes say it's just the soul but it's it's all of these things you know when i was a teenager i looked in the bible first corinthians 7 different places i said what is the position of a believer teenager what's the position what's he do and so i've not only studied that but i i've read it in youth meetings for years because i'm trying to point to their position in the scripture this is you this is your land you're going to be married someday and that's not going to be your land anymore you're going to be in the land of marriage it's a whole different land and he's got all the scriptures that have to do with marriage you're not in that land your position your position in christ is to be a holy ghost filled single young person taking all of your land what's it mean well oh boy we start talking about it you come into your early teens and you struggle with this your hormones are racing and all these like what do i do with these hormones how do i do this how do i give it to the lord how do i balance between normal affections and infatuations towards the opposite sex that's god made you like that and dividing that between temptation and yielding to temptation and thinking wrong thoughts that's a battle for a young person but it's not nothing god didn't know about because he put stuff in there to help you now you can be like most people in this world say i don't want that i don't care what the inheritance there is i'm going to deal with this my own way you you're in a statistic in the rest of the world but there's a few young people to rise up and say what's my position in my land in the scripture what can i fight for amen so it's about other things it's about your position in christ but it's are you fighting for the things of yours now if you have your ephesians bible and i know how quick you guys could stay with me in the scripture now open it up if you would ephesians chapter 4 and verse 19. it says verse 18 says having the understanding darken being alienated from the life of god well verse 17 helps us out here i'm going to do a little teaching here and then we'll find a place to to close but everybody's still with me right listen close now because we're getting real practical this is our inheritance book now ephesians okay you can't dump this out can't leave this stuff undone and if you're not living it today you ought to just say lord it's part of my land i'm not there yet but i'm going to start fighting for this this is mine this i say or therefore and testify in the lord that he henceforth walk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind the emptiness of the mind so as christians we don't walk in this emptiness of mine that the rest of gentiles and people walk in we fill our minds with something and we don't fill our minds with all kinds of things of the world we don't fill our minds with all kinds of trash and you know that's why their minds are empty having understanding dark and being alienated from the life of god through their ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediest now what i see in that scripture is that they have gone past feeling okay the born-again soul will have feeling and sensitivity to what's wrong because their past feeling but our land is to not be past feeling and everybody's grown enough to learn i hope that i'll if you only feed on movies and music of the world and you're hardly ever in the word you're going to get a numbness towards this guy preaching towards things of the lord even your parents talking about it because why all that stuff desensitizes you that you're not sensitive to the holy spirit anymore some people are so hard they can't even be moved the presence of god is right there and they can't even be moved by it because they're full of all kinds of movies and everything else all the time i'm not against watching a good wholesome movie that's not there's nothing wrong with that but i'm talking about who's somebody who's that's their life and their ins they come they're not sensitive anymore they've lost feeling that's why you have a guy sitting there for hours he's left his job and everything he might still be with his mom in the video in the basement playing videos but some of them been married they lose their jobs don't give attention to their wife don't want to provide for their wife don't want to eat anything he's addicted to video games and he's past feeling he doesn't even have feeling anymore for his wife praise the lord their past feeling but a person that's born again has a birth in their soul will have feeling and they'll be sensitive to what's wrong if we lose the sensitivity to what's wrong and right we're in a dangerous spot we're like the other gentiles so part of our land part of our land is i'm just stopping for a minute i'm just thinking about this part of the land that we possess as a christian is to have true feeling and sensitivity to the holy spirit part of our land are you going to fight for it today and you may be a person here who's lost feeling for that maybe a preacher has hurt you or whatever's happened you've lost your sensitivity that you've got your walls all up and you're all blocked towards everything you might come to church but your walls are all up because you've lost your feeling for the holy spirit something's hurt your feeling the bible says there's people that their conscience are seared with an iron they don't even have a conscience anymore you see but our our land that god gives us is we have a sensitivity to the holy spirit and i think it's a sensitivity to other people now we're not compromisers but we have to have a love and a feeling we're not brother braham said back in the 50s he says people are losing the fearling feelings they don't even know who their neighbors are they don't even greet one another when they go down the street they lose normal feeling and doesn't it say their the spirit that will come in the last days is is uh heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god truce breakers false accusers incontinent despisers of those that are good and i keep mentioning them because i'm trying to get to the one that i want to preach on and that who being past feeling is that it no there's something about feeling there where they lose the sensitivity and feeling without here it is without natural affection there's no more natural affection the extreme of that is the homosexuals that's not a natural affection that's a perversion that's an abomination but that's the extreme of it but it starts by losing our feelings lose our feelings for others losing our heart that we can't sit down and have a heart-to-heart conversation about the lord or about where you're at or about what your troubles you're having or help me pray with me we lose that and we become cold towards people because we've lost trust in people we've lost trust in preachers we've lost trust in churches we've lost trust in god sometimes come on friends i i told you i'd be honest this is realities and if you live in this culture everything's designed to make you insensitive in your heart and cold bible says in the last days prophecy in luke the love of many will grow cold and the only fine place you find genuinely real love heart feeling love and the true divine holy ghost love is in the elect that's what he said it's all gone so we're praying and saying wait a minute satan's not going to take it from us i want a sensitivity to the moving of the holy spirit i want my children to see me and i want them to be they know when the presence of god is so strong and so near that they're not going to get up and start walking out and try to push it off they say this is right where i want to be right now and if it moves me to tears it changes my let it do what it wants to do let my child weep in the presence of god i want my children to come to me and feel open to share their heart and not feel distant from me but we become cold and and we push one another away part of our land is retaining our feelings the gentiles our past feeling but retaining our feelings and not just just our emotional human feelings but the feeling of god inside for other people a real compassion for people brother paul i wish you'd preach the message i am preaching the message i'm preaching our inheritance i didn't realize until i got into this i could take a sermon on each of these but if you come down verse 23 says and be renewed in the spirit of your mind i thought our inheritance was all about our soul if it's all about the soul that when why is paul saying that we we be renewed in the spirit of our mind pretty important verse 25 says put away all lying speak every man truth with his neighbor if it's all about the soul our inheritance that's our only land then why is he instructing us not to lie especially as christians we don't lie we don't on our taxes we just twist the twist things a little bit when we tell somebody else the story and add to it or take away from it part of our land that we inherit and take and fight for is i want to speak the truth in love all of you are in the workforce can anybody raise their hand testify we're in a world that people cannot tell the truth they lie all the time i can't tell if they're telling the truth or not we got politicians we've got presidents probably on both sides that have done some lying that's why there's no trust when people lie there's no trust right we have people that are lying to us that's why there's no trust so there's got to be a people rise up more and more and say we're going to be a people of truth we're going to speak the truth whether it's the word truth or whatever it is we're going to be people of the truth this is my land it's not just about the soul oh boy if it's all about the soul why does verse 26 say if you got it open be ye angry and sin not let the not the sun go down upon the wrath paul don't don't talk about our anger everybody gets anger everybody gets the their nose out of joint gets mad for years that uncle jed if it's all just about the soul or land then why is he talking about anger must be part of our land to possess because as satan gets on that land and keeps you angry there's other things that comes from you being angry things begin to break down so he's saying resolve through the holy spirit resolve our anger by the end of the day resolve it take it to the lord in prayer oh what peace we often forfeit take it to the lord in prayer bring it to his throne say god i'm very upset of what this person has done i i don't understand why he would say that or do that what she would say or do that but lord i'm leaving it at the altar tonight because this is bigger than me and i don't want it to fester in my spirit i don't want the devil to get a hold of it my emotions do not belong to the devil to exploit my emotions belong to you tonight lord and i lay my anger at your feet somebody say praise the lord it's part of our land if it's all about the soul then why does paul say in our inheritance chapter verse 20 eight let him that stole steel no more but rather let him labor working with his hands a thing which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth why'd you have to talk about that because part of a christian's land i believe is not stealing but laboring and being able to give why does he say if it's all about the verse 29 let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth corrupt is is old and it's stale and it's i'm thinking of other words right now but you have to study that word corrupt communication it's not positive it's corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace to the ears this is part of our land that's what you have to fight for and some of you have to fight for that more than others for some of you it's a harder fight to not let corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth because it's happening it just it's become so natural to you it just spills out the negative spills out before the positive the corruptness and the old and you can be talking to somebody and you bring up some things from 20 years ago and it just spills out as if it just happened i'm guilty of it anybody else like that but to some people this fight will be harder than other people but whatever your land is as satan's taken you've got to fight for it i see this now i see this maybe this morning you see it but maybe another thing through the words i see it it's been exposed lord i'm going to start fighting for this help me i'm going to lay this at the altar i'm going to start fighting for this land that is better have better communication coming out of my mouth if it's all about the soul then why does paul bring up in verse 31 let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from me with all manners how many years are we going to have christians professing the message and the holy ghost and they're bitter people they hold on to their bareness how long are you going to go that way you're missing some land that's yours and that is to dissolve that bitterness by the cross and the forgiveness of jesus christ and say i'm going to take back this land and i'm not going to be a bitter person anymore somebody say praise the lord it's not all about the soul it's the bitterness gets in your spirit and clamor and evil speaking let it be put away gossip let it be put away from you that might be your issue that the devil's taking that land for years and you just become a professional gospel and give yourself permission to talk about anything and you ought to say no i don't want to speak evil of others i'm taking back this land and let god do with him whatever he does but what you're going to hear out of my mouth is a positive thing i'm going to give that person the benefit of the doubt and when someone hears me speak of them i'm going to say let's pray for them you're taking your land instead of what you learned from your parents or what you learned from your past church that gossip is normal and we just talk and say anything that we want to say i'm here to say instruct you as a pastor we don't give ourselves permission to say anything we want to say we bring this tongue unto the holy spirit say god help me to stay the right and when i say it out of place let me ask forgiveness for it make it right bitterness is important that we get over that and we grow out of it can you say amen what about 32 that says and be kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god for christ's sake has forgiven you why is kindness to others important i thought it was just the soul kindness forgiving some people have become so hard on their walls up they can't even be around anybody anymore especially the church people they got their walls up there's a t-shirt in the display in the store the other day it said i thought it was quite comical when the t-shirt said when this covet is over i still want some people to stay away from me so i sent it to my kids and there's certain family members that i'd like to get him that t-shirt i thought it was funny there's certain people i just would rather just continue this on stay away from me it's how we get sometimes especially ones that we don't like there's some people that don't like hardly anybody i'm good brother paul to get out of my car come in this church enjoy your preaching and get back in my car and go because i love the lord but i can't stand people i understand you can do that for a while but if you if you come in and hear the preaching you're probably going to hear you can't always be that way i'm going to preach the bible and it says things like our land is to be forgiving and to be kind and to be courteous well people in the world can do that yeah i know well they're doing better than you i guess but i think it's part of our land as a christian not just the seals but being kind and forgiving to people who have wronged us you got your walls up today no matter what people have done you got walls up towards god you got the walls up to the gospel or you got walls up to people you know we we have people that can be around everybody else in their life except church people except this church they block this church and they can be around everybody else i don't know why it is but a person like that's got to hit the altar and come to the cross of christ you'll never get that out of the cross you can't be selective like that well they hurt me well then we overcome the people and say lord i've got to find within your calvary my land is to find the forgiveness for people who have hurt me not really a shouting service this morning is it not hanging from the lights i could go on and on verse chapter 5 and verse 1 says be there for followers of god walk in love as christ also loved us hath forgiven himself for us an offering and sacrifice fit for sweet smelling savior but fornication and uncleanness and covenants let it be not be once named among you is become insane neither filleth filthiness nor follow foolish talking or jesting which are not convenient but rather give them i thought it was all about the soul no it's in it's about fornication right it's about filthy talk filthy jesting filthy things it's not just so it has to do with your body too right filthy talk filthy foolish dirty jokes playing those dirty jokes on your phone all the time letting it pass by and being around fornicators the bible says just everybody listen the bible says have no fellowship with phone or caters whether they be in the church or out of the church you should study the bible and you're fellowshipping with them some people they can't fellowship around the church people can fellowship around fornicators bible says don't have any company it's our land is about the company we keep the bible says it it's not just about your soul it's not just about your love for the lord that he gave you but so much more could be said about fornicating spirits and adulterous spirits and if you hang around that long enough it may influence you that's why the bible says don't keep a lot of company with that because those spirits tend to influence you i'm trying to help that person well praise the lord that's good okay just don't forget the scriptures that part of your land is to not accompany yourself with fornicators so you know hey it goes on with more here for this you know that no hormone or unclean person nor covetous man who is an idolater hath any inheritance in the kingdom of god it's about our inheritance so these things just don't work it's not just about the soul it's about the body it's about the spirit it's about where the devil can take the land and this is our inheritance chapter should i just mention before we bring this to a close should i mention chapter 5 and verse 21 submitting yourselves one to another should i go on that part of our land is submitting ourselves to one another am i going to submit to nobody my boss i told them that years ago and they're anybody i'm going to submit to should i go into the next scripture that says wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord can i preach that this is our inheritance and if you're a sister in christ with the holy ghost you're looking at that saying this is my land this is my land and i'm going to fight for it it might be harder on some sisters than others but this is part of my land if god said it he didn't say it for something mean he said it for a good thing and then i wouldn't leave it undone for you sisters to take 30 23 and say the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church he's the savior body therefore as the church is subject in the christ so let the wives be to every husband no let the wives be subject to every man no unto their own husbands i should have gotten amen sisters from that husbands love your wife jesus christ also loved the church and gave himself forth love your wives as christ this is it's in our inheritance chapter brothers it's part of your land are you going to fight for it can you say amen why submit yourself to husbands it's not all about the soul there's more land to possess and we think our spiritual life it's it's it's just certain things but it's not just certain things it's all that it speaks of in the word of god that is our land nobody else is fighting for it but believers will fight for and say this is something that's mined i don't have it yet but this is mine and i'm leaving nothing undone can you say amen it's become so evident to me especially lately in this last political thing of this year and all the other stuff that's happened there's something in humans that want to fight for something there's something about them they like to join a fight take sides to protest something and that spirit is prevalent and it just it becomes a work of the flesh that's called variance how many knows what variance is a work of the flesh and a work of the flesh is is to be different to be poor some to be disagreeable to take the opposite side just the f for the sake of an argument there are some people that do that because they have a work of the flesh variants that's working in them and in the world they work by that work of the flesh all the time they're taking it just to take the opposite side i don't think everybody's like that but i do think too many people even in the message are influenced by this thing we got to take a side we got to protest something we got to fight for something we got to join a cause and we gotta fight we had to take a side there's so much of it we get pulled into it in social media and i said wednesday night we are not called to take sides with either political side to fight for that we're not called for that but i will tell you this morning we have something to fight for why do you make that your fight let's make this our fight to fight for the land that god has given us to fight for our spiritual life if you talk all the energy and the protests and all these things and used it and channeled it to say god what is my land and my inheritance and i want all of it and i'm gonna fight for it if you took all the energy and put it out i'll tell you some things that happen in your life can you say amen if we're going to protest something let's protest what the devil's doing in our lives if we're going to stand to get something let's stand against how the devil is wreaking havoc in our minds can you say man if we're going to have a cause let's fight for the cause of jesus christ and his word if we're going to choose sides let's choose sides with the lord's side let's fight for our inheritance let's fight it's been given to us now so let's fight for it now get up and fight for the things that are yours if you read it in the word say god that's mine every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line i'm trusting in his love divine because every promise in the book is mine can you say amen if you want to join a cause join that cause if you want to fight if you want to protest don't partake in their protest out there but partake of this protest i'm protesting any kind of demon or devil that's trying to come against me and take my land this out here in this world i'm gonna keep reminding you and wednesday night i apologize to do it while everybody's here today i'll do it again publicly is that last year i feel like i need to apologize because i was a little bit influenced by all the news that i was watching and i was influenced a certain way and if that spilled over in the pulpit i want to publicly apologize and say that's wrong for a minister to do we may talk about what's happening in the news we might match it with the prophecy and incidentally i'm pretty excited today because i've seen a sixth vision fulfilled that a prophet seen many years ago can you say man the very color the very the color of her dress was described in the prophecy and for some of you who are waiting around there's only one part of that all six have been fulfilled there's only one left can you say man you better get the holy ghost and get ready for the coming of the lord but i am excited to see the prophecies fulfilled that's what i need to preach and show that in politics but i apologize if i leaned a certain way because i did because of what i was listening to and feeding on join a fight join a cause and i want to remind you both parties are corrupt you can't trust any of these men you don't have to say amen but you can't trust any of that system you don't know whether you're getting the truth or not but i have a thing you can trust this morning and it's not even me it's the word of god can you say man you can trust that you want to put your faith in a candidate or or something going on out there why don't you push to trust in a man that in the 1940s or whatever had seven visions six of them is fulfilled can you say man the seventh one is we don't know how close it is but why don't you push and tr your trust in something like that i can have confidence that god has spoken god knows what's going on and if you're going to fight for something i wish somebody would fight for these things in ephesians fight for loving your wife better fight for tearing down your walls in your heart fight for love again fight for forgiveness fight to establish new friends i make a call to you that are not in church maybe because you're sick but you're just distant from the congregation i'm encouraging you to get up and fight against the devil who's cheating you out of fellowship fight say god give me the forgiveness so i can establish new friends in the gospel brother brahm says in this last quote oh my how i like that the believer's promise you say what's that i know you've been sitting quite a while you can go ahead and stand as long as you listen to me preach this quote go ahead and stand as long as you say amen to this oh my how i like that the believer's promise you say what's that got to do with us to every believer the believer's promise is eternal life the believer's promise is life joy peace long-sunkering suffering gentleness patience fruits of the spirit divine healing a dozen things i got wrote down here nearly that is your possession it doesn't belong to the world it belongs to believers it belongs to you but you cannot have it until you fight for it it's yours everything that's seen every temporal thing that's seen belongs to me god give it to me because through christ he gave it to me and things unseen because belongs to me amen i like that and what you can see like divine healing somewhere like that that's good we appreciate that but the unseen as well everything's seen everything unseen in christ it belongs to me he purchased it at calvary can you say amen i'm an heir of divine healing i'm an heir of joy i've got a right to be happy the devil told you you don't really have a right to be happy with all that's happened and all that you have done i say tell them what brother graham said here the word says you have a right to be happy it's proud of your land can you say man so what makes you so happy i've got a right to be how do you know because i'm an heir to it amen now i feel religious yes i'm an heir to the happiness i'm an heir to joy i'm an heir to peace i'm an heir to eternal life i'm an heir to the holy spirit amen i'm an heir to every evidence that it's god amen amen amen say amen to the word of god
