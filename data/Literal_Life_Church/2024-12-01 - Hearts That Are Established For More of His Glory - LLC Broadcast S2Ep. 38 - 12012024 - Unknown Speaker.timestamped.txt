[3:42] Psalms
[3:44] 112 and verse starting at verse one
[3:49] praise ye the Lord blessed is the man
[3:51] that fearth the Lord that delighteth
[3:54] greatly in his Commandments his seed
[3:57] shall be Mighty upon Earth notice the
[4:00] the promises and the things that come
[4:02] from a man that fearth the Lord and
[4:04] delighteth greatly in his Commandments
[4:06] and I don't want to boast this morning
[4:08] but I I really feel this blessed because
[4:10] I'm starting to see some of these things
[4:12] come to pass in my life just simply
[4:15] because as a young man I fell in love
[4:17] with the Lord I fell in love with his
[4:19] word and I can tell you there's there's
[4:22] no greater thing I greatly Delight in
[4:24] and that's the word of God and his
[4:26] Commandments his seed shall be Mighty
[4:28] upon the Earth the gener generation of
[4:30] the upright shall be blessed wealth and
[4:32] riches shall be in his house and his
[4:35] righteousness endureth forever unto the
[4:38] upright there ariseth light in the
[4:40] darkness he is gracious and full of
[4:42] compassion and righteous a good man
[4:44] showeth favor and lendeth he will guide
[4:47] his affairs with discretion surely he
[4:51] shall not be moved forever the righteous
[4:54] shall be an everlasting remembrance he
[4:57] shall not be afraid of evil Tidings I
[5:00] don't know if you know what that means
[5:02] but it actually means in our in our
[5:04] everyday terms here he shall not be
[5:07] afraid this blessed man shall not be
[5:09] afraid of bad
[5:12] news because that's the problem with bad
[5:14] news is that we get
[5:16] fearful sometimes we can get fearful of
[5:18] stuff that hasn't even happened yet
[5:21] that's the way the devil works but he's
[5:23] standing in such a place and such a
[5:25] position in the Lord that he he is not
[5:28] afraid of bad news and bad things that
[5:30] would come his way his heart is fixed
[5:33] it's fastened it's because it's trusting
[5:36] in the Lord his heart is fixed that's
[5:39] the part I want you to concentrate in
[5:41] his heart is fixed it's not up and down
[5:44] it's not like a roller coaster it's not
[5:46] everywhere it's not in and out it's not
[5:49] believing one day and not believing the
[5:51] next it's actually fixed it's set
[5:55] because he's trusting the Lord his heart
[5:57] is established he shall not be afraid
[6:00] until he see his desire upon his enemies
[6:03] he hath dispersed he hath given to the
[6:05] poor his righteousness endureth forever
[6:08] his horn shall be exalted with honor the
[6:11] wicked shall see it and be grieved he
[6:12] shall Nash with his teeth and melt away
[6:15] the desire of the wicked Shall Perish
[6:17] and I'm just going to remind you uh
[6:20] verse 7 and 8 he shall not be afraid of
[6:22] evil Tidings his heart is fixed trusting
[6:24] the Lord his heart is established how
[6:28] many this morning want to say Lord
[6:30] establish my heart establish my heart
[6:33] now in 1 Peter chapter 5 I want to link
[6:36] this in and may not get to all of this
[6:39] today but I have next Sunday as well so
[6:41] we'll just try to split this up but in
[6:44] in 1 Peter chapter 5 and verse uh
[6:49] 10 but the God of all Grace who hath
[6:52] called us unto his eternal glory by
[6:56] Christ Jesus I want to stop right there
[6:58] do you know what the Lord is called you
[7:00] to he's called you to to glory amen
[7:03] we're called to
[7:05] Glory he's called us un his eternal
[7:07] glory by Christ Jesus after that you
[7:10] have suffered a while make you perfect
[7:14] establish strengthen settle you to him
[7:18] be glory and Dominion forever and ever
[7:20] so after you've went through trials
[7:22] after you've suffered a while it'll make
[7:25] you perfect establish you strengthen you
[7:27] settle you how do you how many want to
[7:29] be settled this morning and all of this
[7:32] is the precursor all of this is the
[7:33] pre-work of the Lord to bring us to more
[7:36] Glory so I want to speak on hearts that
[7:38] are established for more of his glory
[7:40] that's what we're called to for more of
[7:42] his glory now when I looked at Psalms
[7:46] chap 1112 here I was greatly blessed to
[7:48] read this to see this very blessed man
[7:51] of God who feared the Lord and uh that
[7:55] uh that attribute that was in him and
[7:57] all these attributes got my attention
[7:59] but particularly the one that said that
[8:01] his heart was fixed and it was
[8:04] established he had a heart that was
[8:07] fixed uh it was fastened fixed means
[8:10] fastened it means it's positioned it's
[8:13] not jumping around but it's got a he's
[8:15] got a heart that's fixed and the reason
[8:18] why he's so blessed and there's more
[8:19] glory and prosperity coming in his life
[8:22] is because he's got his heart lined up
[8:25] with God's Commandments number one but
[8:28] remember when we're born and again his
[8:30] Commandments and his word is within our
[8:32] soul so now I want to bring this out
[8:34] this morning that our hearts have to be
[8:37] in line with what's in our soul see why
[8:41] do you say that I thought the heart was
[8:43] the soul there's too many places in the
[8:44] scripture that to tell us and I've been
[8:46] speaking on this the last few weeks
[8:48] talking about our heart a little bit
[8:50] because our heart our heart are the seed
[8:52] of our emotions our spirit memory
[8:55] conscience and all that that's a
[8:57] different thing than our soul we are
[8:59] three three part being can you say Amen
[9:01] matter of fact Jesus separated this so
[9:03] I'm not unscriptural this morning Jesus
[9:05] separated this as he quoted from Moses
[9:08] Moses told the people when you serve the
[9:10] Lord when you love me love me with all
[9:13] your heart soul mind and strength you're
[9:17] not just your soul but you have your
[9:19] heart you have your mind you have your
[9:21] strength and God says when you love me
[9:24] don't just love me with your soul love
[9:26] me with all of you love me with your
[9:29] heart that shows us that the heart the
[9:32] heart can be different than what's going
[9:34] on in the soul how many knows I preached
[9:36] this the last few weeks the heart can
[9:38] have condemnation on it but God doesn't
[9:41] condemn us in our soul there's therefore
[9:43] no condemnation to them which are in
[9:45] Christ Jesus so you can see the
[9:48] importance now that you live a life of
[9:50] this as this man does here that not only
[9:53] is your soul fixed is your soul settled
[9:56] it's settled that I I believe I'm a
[9:58] believe I know I'm a believer it's as
[10:00] good as done I'm going to Heaven someday
[10:02] I don't fear death can you say Amen my
[10:05] soul is settled but now it's important
[10:08] to get your heart just as
[10:11] fixed and line your heart up with where
[10:14] your soul
[10:16] is that you have a heart that's
[10:18] established because as you've been
[10:20] learning the soul you know where you are
[10:22] in God you can say Amen to that but you
[10:25] see your heart uh is not something that
[10:28] you follow your heart has to follow
[10:30] what's in the
[10:32] soul can you say Amen you get it now
[10:35] your heart is not something to follow
[10:37] the the the worldly songs say follow
[10:39] your heart they tell our young people
[10:40] follow their heart no no no no we don't
[10:42] follow our heart the heart is deceitful
[10:44] Above All Things the heart can be uh
[10:47] feel like it's saved one day and feel
[10:49] like it's lost the next the heart can
[10:51] fall in love with somebody one day and
[10:53] the next say they can't stand
[10:55] them come on now you know that's true
[10:58] you got to Heart yourself
[11:00] and if you depended on where your heart
[11:01] or emotions were every day I'll tell you
[11:04] you you'd never know where you stood and
[11:06] that's why it's important to get now our
[11:08] hearts in line with what's in our soul
[11:11] get our hearts in line with the what the
[11:13] word says about us what the word where
[11:16] he where are we we positioned as a son
[11:19] and daughter of God can you say Amen
[11:22] praise the Lord so now we see then
[11:24] separating the heart conditions
[11:26] sometimes and Jesus said that love me
[11:28] with all your heart soul mind and
[11:31] strength to with all of you with
[11:33] everything that you are you should love
[11:35] him not just with your soul so when
[11:38] we've been separating and preaching on
[11:40] the heart we've been separating that
[11:41] heart condition sometimes from your soul
[11:44] your heart can be up and down your heart
[11:46] can hold grudges for many years your
[11:49] heart and I'm talking about Christians
[11:51] your heart can hold a grudge for many
[11:53] years how many remember my teaching on
[11:55] it there was a young man in the prayer
[11:57] line and he says he's come to the prayer
[11:58] line for for two things and that's to
[12:00] Deliverance of a smoking habit and next
[12:03] thing he said you've held a grudge
[12:04] towards a family member since you were a
[12:06] little boy that long he held a grudge so
[12:09] now here he is coming for more of the
[12:11] Lord but you see now you can't come
[12:13] without saying I've got to address this
[12:15] Grudge because I can't fully come to the
[12:18] Lord free until I deal with what's in my
[12:21] heart sir so so now it can have grudges
[12:25] it can have hurt the heart can have pain
[12:27] for years all all this while still
[12:30] sometimes in church sometimes with a
[12:32] with the true spirit of God it's hard
[12:34] for us to believe but someone can have
[12:36] the true spirit of God and still have
[12:39] something in their heart that's not
[12:40] quite right but you see now I'm taking
[12:42] this to the next level because this man
[12:44] in Psalms
[12:46] chapter2 it's not just that his soul is
[12:48] a fixed but his heart is AIX his heart
[12:52] is fixed on something it's it's it's
[12:55] it's settled can you say man it's
[12:57] established and it's not his heart it's
[13:00] not that his heart is following every
[13:03] whim that no his heart is following one
[13:05] thing it's what the soul says it's what
[13:08] the word says so now if you can imagine
[13:10] that that I'm I'm the soul and I'm going
[13:13] in a certain direction and I'm
[13:15] confessing the word and the Soul's going
[13:17] forward by the way this is the soul this
[13:19] is me the soul it's going forward all
[13:21] the time it's going it's confessing the
[13:23] word that word drops in your heart it's
[13:26] going forward I know who I am I know
[13:28] where I belong along I know where I'm
[13:30] going it says the same thing as Jesus
[13:32] said I know where I came from thus I
[13:34] know where I'm going these are kind of
[13:36] statements that come from the soul level
[13:39] but you see now your heart is a
[13:41] different thing and so now as you're
[13:43] going forward then you got to get your
[13:45] heart right behind you brother Jason get
[13:47] you're you're my heart okay you get
[13:50] right behind me right behind me and so
[13:52] you cannot be going with the soul and
[13:55] the heart is just going everywhere and
[13:57] running down the aisle and going this
[13:58] way and looking that way yes I knew you
[14:01] would do that very well you can't have
[14:03] that going on or you're going to be a
[14:05] mess as a Christian the soul is heading
[14:07] the direction and so you tell that heart
[14:10] where to go can you say Amen that heart
[14:13] must follow what's in your
[14:16] soul you say well I don't know if that
[14:18] can happen well then you don't believe
[14:20] Christianity because he said love God
[14:22] with all your heart soul mind and
[14:24] strength that love that's in your soul
[14:26] say I love the Lord Brother Paul
[14:27] everybody loves the Lord and True
[14:29] Believers love the Lord but you can't
[14:30] just love them from your soul you got to
[14:32] love them from your mind you got to love
[14:34] them from your heart and that heart I'm
[14:36] not done with you yet that heart has to
[14:38] follow in every footstep the same way as
[14:42] your soul is going every day you want a
[14:45] scripture I wish above all things that
[14:48] you would be in health and prosper as
[14:51] your soul is
[14:53] [Applause]
[14:55] prospering I wish that you're you would
[14:58] be a healthy
[14:59] uh Christian in all ways and that you
[15:02] would Prosper nothing against Prosperity
[15:04] but it's only as your soul prospers
[15:06] don't pursue Prosperity if your Soul's
[15:09] not in the right place don't pursue the
[15:11] world's prosperity and get your heart
[15:13] rate without the Holy Ghost you got to
[15:15] have the Holy Ghost but when you have
[15:17] the Holy Ghost you've been converted you
[15:19] know where you're going it's never weak
[15:21] it's strong and it's going in a certain
[15:23] direction and it goes the same way it
[15:25] has to follow you're not following your
[15:28] heart your heart is following where your
[15:30] soul is going got your hands up I want
[15:34] you to do just like the soul says it
[15:36] just like
[15:39] this
[15:41] amen God Amen very good you're coming
[15:46] along my heart's coming along with My
[15:48] Soul praise the Lord do I need to get a
[15:52] beer like this and
[15:54] everything appreciate you buddy thank
[15:56] you my dad used to say had a little joke
[15:59] when he went in restaurants he made fun
[16:01] of some of the waitresses and waiters
[16:02] cuz they'd say okay I got your table
[16:05] Walk This Way please and my dad would
[16:07] start walking exactly like the
[16:10] waitress sometimes it was
[16:12] embarrassing cuz they walked a lot of
[16:14] different
[16:15] ways just thought I'd add that in that
[16:18] was funny wasn't I like Walk This Way
[16:20] please and I watch Dad just walk and he
[16:22] was going like whatever way that
[16:23] waitress would walk he's walk I said dad
[16:25] what are you doing what are you
[16:27] doing but it's to illustrate
[16:29] R the heart the rest of your life your
[16:33] private life needs to be in step and
[16:37] aligned with where your Soul's going but
[16:40] you've got to clean that heart out and
[16:42] get it in line with where your soul
[16:46] is because a Believer must learn they
[16:48] cannot ignore what's going on in their
[16:50] heart in fact today I would say that the
[16:52] heart must be aligned with what is
[16:54] happening in the soul it must follow it
[16:57] it cannot be left to itself the heart
[16:59] and emotions cannot be left to
[17:01] themselves I appreciate all your
[17:03] comments and how much you enjoy the word
[17:05] I love to get it it's very appreciative
[17:07] but if your heart is still locked up
[17:09] we're not moving into a greater glory
[17:11] that he's called you to if your heart is
[17:14] still locked
[17:15] up you can't say Amen in your soul and
[17:18] then go back home and cling to your
[17:20] habits and the bondage of your
[17:23] heart I'm not here to put anybody in put
[17:26] anybody out I'm not here to say whether
[17:27] you have the Holy Ghost or you you don't
[17:29] have the GL you have to know that for
[17:30] yourself I'm not so sure I like
[17:33] ministers that were saying whether you
[17:34] got it or not I think we should be
[17:36] careful of that you have to know for
[17:38] yourself but if you know you got it and
[17:41] you know that you you were changed on
[17:42] the inside you hold on to that and it's
[17:44] anchored it's settled that's why Jesus
[17:46] said come unto me all you that are weary
[17:49] and are heavy laden and I will give rest
[17:52] for your soul where the soul the soul
[17:54] has to have rest first in other words
[17:57] you have laid down the strugg to try to
[17:59] gain entrance into heaven Yourself by
[18:01] your good works you lay all that down
[18:03] when the Holy Ghost comes you are at
[18:05] rest I've made it because he went to
[18:08] Calvary for me he took care of my sins
[18:11] my soul is complete in a Sabbath an
[18:14] eternal
[18:15] Sabbath maybe I should preach where the
[18:17] Soul's at first on now so you can see
[18:20] where it's at so your heart can follow
[18:22] the soul is in an eternal Rest by the
[18:25] Holy Ghost it's in an eternal Sabbath
[18:28] the work is finished it is done I am
[18:32] saved Sanctified and filled with the
[18:34] Holy Ghost
[18:36] Hall it's not tossed about by every wind
[18:39] of Doctrine but the heart can do
[18:42] that the heart can be tossed about with
[18:45] fear the heart can hear the word from
[18:47] the doctor and all of a sudden fear
[18:49] grips your
[18:50] heart and I'm not saying that's not real
[18:52] don't deny that you don't have those
[18:54] feelings but you got to bring that heart
[18:55] right back in line with the word of God
[18:58] I know that's what the doctor says but
[19:00] my soul says I am healed by the grace of
[19:03] God what's the soul saying what's the
[19:05] word saying and then you got to give it
[19:07] time to see how God will bring that
[19:09] healing because he may not bring it
[19:10] instantaneously but all the while your
[19:12] heart has to be in
[19:14] line with where your soul is going
[19:17] praise the Lord so now we we we can't
[19:21] follow all the Preaching Online or here
[19:24] at church and say amen and then follow
[19:26] our heart all week you can't follow the
[19:28] heart the heart has to be trained to
[19:31] follow where our soul is
[19:34] going say well the body's not going to
[19:36] uh inherit the Rapture I know that
[19:39] understand that but this body will come
[19:41] so in tune and so
[19:44] filled with the spirit of God that it'll
[19:48] be so consumed by it someday that it
[19:51] can't take the glory of God anymore and
[19:54] you have to take your new
[19:55] body see we limit how much the Holy
[19:58] Ghost fill all of this body fill this
[20:00] mind I should I don't think we should
[20:02] ever limit that praise the Lord so we
[20:06] must have the same security and
[20:10] stability in our hearts as is with our
[20:13] within our souls this this man in the
[20:16] text says that he guides his affairs
[20:20] with
[20:21] discretion this man guides his Affairs
[20:24] his Affairs don't guide him can I get an
[20:28] amen
[20:30] amen Adam ruled and Reign Over this
[20:34] Earth Adam controlled things Adam
[20:37] controlled his environment but when he
[20:39] fell his environment controlled him
[20:43] that's the fall of Man but when
[20:45] Redemption came through Calvary to begin
[20:48] the process of bringing back Sons Back
[20:50] to Eden again what were coming back to
[20:53] every day in our lives is a control can
[20:56] you say Amen not that things control us
[20:59] not that our emotions control us not
[21:02] that our finances control us but we as a
[21:05] Son of God control our finances we
[21:08] control our emotions can you say Amen by
[21:11] the Holy
[21:13] Ghost Hallelujah his Affairs don't guide
[21:16] him he guides his affairs with
[21:18] discretion oh I want to live that way
[21:22] more his heart is lined up with his soul
[21:25] the Bible says I wish above all things
[21:26] that you prosper and be in health as
[21:28] your soul prosper
[21:29] the soul that has crossed into let's
[21:31] talk about the soul again a minute the
[21:33] soul that has crossed into eternal life
[21:35] by the Holy Ghost is at complete rest it
[21:37] has no condemnation it's already passed
[21:40] into eternal life it's already glorified
[21:42] you know the Bible says that it's
[21:43] already glorified sitting in Heavenly
[21:46] places already that's your soul it's
[21:49] already sitting positioned as a Believer
[21:51] sitting in Heavenly places in
[21:54] Christ that's your soul with the Holy
[21:57] Ghost position secure
[22:01] sealed fixed which means fast and
[22:04] securely in its position by the way in
[22:08] the soul there's no fear of death at all
[22:11] so you have to pray about that because
[22:13] if you have this huge fear of death in
[22:16] your soul level that means things aren't
[22:19] settled with your salvation
[22:22] right because when salvation comes and
[22:25] you have accepted your pardon and your
[22:27] soul has passed from death un life and
[22:29] it's been converted what comes with with
[22:31] that is the security that you don't fear
[22:36] death you don't fear death at all Paul
[22:43] stated from his standing in the soul and
[22:46] you will state this as well when you
[22:48] have the standing in your soul death
[22:51] where is your sting grave this is the
[22:54] soul speaking can you say Amen death
[22:57] where is your sting grave where is your
[23:00] Victory I am completely unafraid to go
[23:04] to the Grave I'm completely unafraid if
[23:06] it's my time to go today if I drop dead
[23:09] in a heart attack today I am completely
[23:12] unafraid I'm ready to
[23:16] go my soul says that where's the sting
[23:19] because Paul where you get that from uh
[23:23] Satan had his Stinger taken out at
[23:26] Calvary he had his sting of death taken
[23:28] out of Calvary God just took it and
[23:31] plucked that Stinger of death out and
[23:33] now all he can do is Buzz around your
[23:37] head what about this is and it's there's
[23:40] no Stinger Paul said where's your
[23:42] stinging you lost your Stinger at
[23:44] Calvary where's the sting of death it's
[23:47] gone right I don't have any fear of
[23:49] death
[23:50] amen I don't have any fear of the
[23:53] Grave where is your sting I don't fear
[23:57] the grave I don't fear this is this is
[23:59] the state of the Soul can you say Amen
[24:02] Paul had another one he says for me to
[24:04] live as Christ and for me to die is
[24:08] gain it's actually better it's an
[24:13] upgrade how many likes an
[24:15] upgrade death for a Christian is not
[24:18] death it's an upgrade and I'm telling
[24:20] you it's a huge upgrade and it's the
[24:22] best retirement you could ever get there
[24:25] is no better retirement plan than the ho
[24:28] ghost I'm here to tell you there's no
[24:30] upgrade like the holy ghost that you're
[24:32] going to get someday can I get an amen
[24:35] can I get a shout in the camp that's
[24:37] what your soul says for me to live is
[24:41] Christ so until I die I have Christ I
[24:44] can make it but for me to die it's an
[24:47] upgrade it's a gain that's why I'm not
[24:50] afraid of it it's a win-win situation if
[24:53] you have that fear this morning of death
[24:55] and are not come to that rest in your
[24:57] soul I'm not rebuking you I'm just
[25:00] saying you need to come to that rest in
[25:02] your soul that your sins are forgiven
[25:05] that you've been Justified and the only
[25:07] way he looks at you is through the blood
[25:09] and you can say I've passed from death
[25:11] and judgment already in eternal life
[25:13] already passed from life I'm not afraid
[25:15] of death you can have that Christ today
[25:18] by asking him in sincerity I want to
[25:21] know that this rest is upon my soul
[25:24] level you can know that today I wouldn't
[25:26] leave here till you had it you got this
[25:27] huge fear death that I I'm going to be
[25:29] condemned by God you can bring that
[25:31] condemnation to him this morning and
[25:33] that'll be settled he he became me that
[25:36] I could become him he took the Stinger
[25:38] of death death is only just a a a
[25:42] transfer room for believers can you say
[25:44] Amen when you give your heart to the
[25:46] Lord then then your life is a hunger to
[25:48] get that heart cleared up and that heart
[25:52] cleaned and that heart settled and that
[25:55] heart lined up and secure cured like the
[25:59] soul is that's right fixed my heart is
[26:04] fixed is mentioned three times in the
[26:05] Bible David says it Lord my heart is
[26:08] fixed so I will give praise to the Lord
[26:10] Lord my heart is secured it's fastened
[26:13] my heart is set on the
[26:15] goal my heart is not up and down my
[26:18] heart has been fixed in line with my
[26:21] soul and what your word says some other
[26:24] examples to show us the difference in
[26:25] the heart and the soul I want to bring
[26:27] this one up there's some stuff I'm going
[26:29] to skip this morning and get to it next
[26:30] Sunday but I want to bring this up
[26:32] because this brings the difference in
[26:33] the heart and the Soul can you imagine
[26:35] Jesus quoted Isaiah 29 and verse 13
[26:39] where it says wherefore the Lord said
[26:42] for as much as this people draw near me
[26:45] with their mouth and with their lips do
[26:48] honor me but have removed their heart
[26:52] far from
[26:54] me and their fear toward me is taught by
[26:57] The Pri recept to men this isn't the
[26:59] fear of the Lord of the man in Psalms
[27:01] 1112 you know the difference in the fear
[27:03] of the Lord and the fear of man the fear
[27:05] of the Lord is a respect it's an honor
[27:06] for his word but it's not fearful being
[27:09] afraid that I'm going to be condemned at
[27:11] judgment that's not it no we don't live
[27:13] with that all the time but the fear of
[27:15] men when it's taught from you then it
[27:17] causes men to do this to remove their
[27:20] can you imagine somebody can let me say
[27:24] it the way the prophet said it for as
[27:26] much as the people they draw near me
[27:28] with their mouth and with their lips
[27:31] they even honor
[27:32] me but their heart is far from me how in
[27:36] the world can that happen now I know
[27:39] this is an extreme case but it's an
[27:41] example that somebody can be so well at
[27:44] honoring the Lord and nobody really
[27:46] really knows except God that heart can
[27:48] be so distant from the Lord I know it's
[27:52] convicting I know I'm preaching hard but
[27:54] listen I'm just saying to you may we all
[27:57] just get this desire this week Lord Line
[28:00] This Heart up with where my soul is Line
