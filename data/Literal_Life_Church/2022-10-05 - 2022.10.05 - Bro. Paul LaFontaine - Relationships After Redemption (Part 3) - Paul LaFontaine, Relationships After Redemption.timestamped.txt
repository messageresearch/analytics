[0:00] song nobody else knows it but me and
[0:01] Sherry but I should sing songs that
[0:04] everybody knows I guess but praise the
[0:05] Lord God's good anyhow amen and I just
[0:09] wanted to say that brother Ted Daniels
[0:11] let's remember him in prayer when he
[0:13] read that tonight he sent me a testimony
[0:15] a couple days ago and I'm not going to
[0:16] steal his Thunder he may want to share
[0:18] this Sunday but you know about I guess
[0:21] it was maybe a year ago I was really
[0:22] lord gave me just a real special prayer
[0:25] and Faith for Sister Janice who's losing
[0:27] her eyesight but she got the best report
[0:30] since she's been a young girl she got
[0:32] the best report from the doctor a few
[0:33] days ago that her eyesight is returning
[0:36] and improving very well so maybe he can
[0:40] amen
[0:43] he can give the details of it what we
[0:45] rejoice in the Lord in that and I wasn't
[0:47] going to back down and keep believing
[0:49] the Lord's going to restore all of her
[0:51] sight to it she's doing much better
[0:52] praise the Lord God is good we're going
[0:55] to Let's study in Romans chapter 12
[0:56] tonight and continue in the series a
[0:58] little bit in relationships after
[1:00] Redemption and let's just take our
[1:03] portion out of just a little study
[1:04] tonight in Romans chapter 12 and some
[1:08] really really good things in here in
[1:09] relation to our series and we don't want
[1:12] to skip it I think it's the next place
[1:13] after the book of Acts that we could
[1:15] talk about what relationships look like
[1:18] after
[1:20] after he redeemed us at Calvary and paid
[1:22] the price filled what's with the Holy
[1:25] Ghost and we have the book of Acts and
[1:26] all the mighty acts that took place
[1:28] through the Believers because of the
[1:30] Oneness of God being restored but then
[1:33] we realized we've been speaking about
[1:35] Not only was the relationship with God
[1:37] restored but the relationship with one
[1:39] another was restored as well and so we
[1:43] have another window here in scripture
[1:44] here in Romans 12 that I think it
[1:46] expresses it good after we come through
[1:48] all of the teaching in Romans concerning
[1:51] justification and where a Believer
[1:53] stands and the contrast or I shouldn't
[1:56] say the contrast but Abraham believing
[1:58] it was accounted under righteousness and
[2:00] seeing what that righteousness is then
[2:01] towards the end as often Paul does in in
[2:05] some of his books that he gets to what
[2:07] does this look like this teaching this
[2:09] Doctrine this this truth what does it
[2:12] look like in an everyday setting with
[2:14] your interaction your with your life
[2:16] with Believers with people of the world
[2:18] what does Christianity look like and I'm
[2:21] always one that leans so well I want to
[2:22] see what it looks like I want to do that
[2:24] I want to be that and so there's another
[2:26] window up so let's study this together
[2:28] tonight if you don't mind Romans 12 and
[2:30] verse 1. I beseech you therefore
[2:32] Brethren by the mercies of God that ye
[2:34] presents your bodies a Living Sacrifice
[2:36] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[2:39] reasonable service and be not conformed
[2:41] to this world but be transformed by the
[2:43] renewing of your mind she may prove what
[2:46] is that good and acceptable and perfect
[2:48] will of God for I say through the grace
[2:50] given unto me to every man that is among
[2:53] you not to think of himself more highly
[2:56] than he ought to think but to think
[2:58] soberly according as God hath dealt to
[3:01] every man The Measure of Faith so when
[3:04] we come together to the body of Christ
[3:05] we cannot have that thought that I'm
[3:08] better than everybody else we actually
[3:09] got to have a deeper thought and that is
[3:11] that Christ has deposited a portion of
[3:14] himself and everyone that you're looking
[3:16] at
[3:17] that should change our attitude right
[3:20] that God has given a measure to each one
[3:22] and so there is no one higher than the
[3:24] others especially if I've got God in Me
[3:26] and You Got God in you we look at it
[3:29] that it's all God it's a measure of God
[3:31] so there's no Lesser God can you say
[3:33] Amen in the person next to you so that's
[3:35] the way we got to look at it for as we
[3:38] have many members in the one body and
[3:39] all members have not the same office so
[3:42] we being many are one body in Christ and
[3:44] everyone members of another
[3:46] having then gifts differing according to
[3:49] the grace that is given to us whether
[3:50] prophecy let us prophesy according to
[3:52] the proportion of Faith or Ministry let
[3:54] us wait on our ministry or he that
[3:56] teacheth on teaching or he that
[3:58] exhorteth on the exhortation he that
[4:00] giveth let him do it with Simplicity he
[4:03] that ruleth with diligence he that
[4:05] showeth Mercy with cheerfulness let love
[4:08] be without the stimulation abhor that
[4:11] which is evil cleave to that which is
[4:12] good be kindly affection one to another
[4:15] with Brotherly Love in honor preferring
[4:17] one another not slothful in business
[4:19] fervent in spirit serving the lord
[4:21] rejoicing in Hope patience and
[4:23] tribulation continuing instant in prayer
[4:25] Distributing to the necessity of the
[4:28] Saints given to hospitality bless them
[4:31] which persecute you bless and curse not
[4:33] rejoice with them that do rejoice and
[4:35] weep with them that we be of the same
[4:37] mind one toward another mind not high
[4:39] things but condescend to Men of lowest
[4:41] State be not wise in your own conceits
[4:43] recompense no man evil for evil provide
[4:46] things honest in the sight of all men if
[4:49] it be possible as such is life in you
[4:51] live peaceably with all men dearly
[4:55] beloved avenge not yourself but rather
[4:57] give place under wrath for it is written
[4:59] venge is mine I will repay saith the
[5:02] Lord therefore if any if thine enemy
[5:05] hunger feed him if he thirsts give him a
[5:08] drink for in doing so Thou shalt Heap
[5:11] coals of fire on his head be not
[5:13] overcome of evil but overcome evil with
[5:17] good there's a lot of things in there
[5:20] you can't live all that except you have
[5:22] the Holy Ghost that's for sure amen
[5:24] father thank you for this evening bless
[5:26] us and anoint us with your words father
[5:28] as we teach this together tonight we
[5:30] just gather around your word give us
[5:32] those Eternal things within us Lord that
[5:35] we can live them out each day we commit
[5:37] it to you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[5:38] Christ amen God bless you may be seated
[5:41] tonight
[5:42] so we're going to continue speaking
[5:45] about relationships after Redemption
[5:47] this will be part three and this will be
[5:50] a little bit more of a teaching tonight
[5:51] knowing that it is Romans 12 and just to
[5:54] break it down just a little bit so we
[5:57] are in speaking about relationships with
[5:59] others and we know that the most
[6:01] important relationship that was restored
[6:03] after Calvary is the relationship
[6:05] between God and man what they lost in
[6:08] the Garden of Eden was restored back and
[6:10] so that was the most important God in
[6:12] man and then we see the fruits in the
[6:14] book of Acts of men so coming back into
[6:17] Oneness with God that they took note
[6:19] that the men had been with Jesus it
[6:21] wasn't just they had been with Jesus
[6:22] they had Jesus living in them and they
[6:24] had become so one with God that someone
[6:26] walking in the shadow of Peter was
[6:29] healed can you say Amen now that's not
[6:31] Peter that's something else has happened
[6:33] to Peter and all the book of Acts really
[6:36] shows what the fruits are to God coming
[6:40] back and complete Oneness with man again
[6:42] and so but now then we we have the
[6:45] interactions with other people in
[6:47] talking about relationship with that and
[6:49] what that looks like now in life after
[6:51] God after God corrects the sin problem
[6:54] from the Fallen Eden after God corrects
[6:58] how many to believe that God corrected
[6:59] God completely corrected the sin problem
[7:02] in our nature God corrects it in his own
[7:05] way and remember the reason there was
[7:08] trouble in interacting with others in
[7:11] expressions of hatred and jealousy and
[7:15] anger and killing and persecuting and
[7:19] making fun of and breaking off Oneness
[7:22] with one another and marriages and all
[7:25] this began to come after the fall we
[7:27] never seen that before but the reason
[7:29] that we had all those attributes come
[7:31] forth is because the Oneness was broke
[7:33] in the beginning so all that remember
[7:36] all that jealousy all that hatred none
[7:39] of these things originated in God the
[7:41] the persecuting the making fun of other
[7:43] people being sarcastic putting other
[7:45] people down and then breaking Oneness
[7:47] with other people and shunning other
[7:49] people all these attributes and fruits
[7:51] come from the sin in the beginning and I
[7:55] want to say this that really it can
[7:57] never be right with others it can never
[8:00] be perfectly right with others unless
[8:02] God deals with that Fallen nature
[8:05] let me just say something about help in
[8:09] this world we we have the world is a
[8:12] world has some pretty good things these
[8:14] days for a good marriage and uh helping
[8:18] the family and helping anger issues you
[8:21] can go to anger management classes and
[8:23] it may it may help and it's just like
[8:26] with medicine the world has this all
[8:28] these medicines and brother Brown never
[8:31] put those medicines down he never he
[8:33] gave all the glory to God so science
[8:35] advances and we don't agree with them if
[8:38] they put God aside but we don't put God
[8:39] aside but we're thankful there's so many
[8:41] self-help things to help you and so if
[8:44] God gets the healing but he uses a
[8:46] medicine to do it for a while or
[8:48] whatever we give God glory for it this
[8:50] world is full of pretty good things now
[8:52] after six thousand years and even though
[8:55] it's off the tree of knowledge of men
[8:56] developing it there's some pretty good
[8:58] stuff to help the family to help
[9:00] marriages and different things I I
[9:02] listen I'm not going to ever be critical
[9:04] of something thing whatever it is helps
[9:07] a marriage get better I'm not going to
[9:09] be critical it helps your anger get
[9:11] better
[9:13] I say praise the lord we need less
[9:15] people anger in this angry in this world
[9:17] but you see now all of those things
[9:19] though they help in a great way
[9:22] um all of it will never be as pure and
[9:27] as original as when God deals with the
[9:30] sinful nature of a man
[9:33] can I say it that way none of that will
[9:35] ever be as pure or as original as what
[9:38] they had in the garden when you have
[9:39] Oneness with God when the god in man's
[9:42] nature is the same and that's living
[9:44] within him and living out your
[9:46] relationships are going to be the best
[9:48] that they can ever be back then just
[9:50] simply by Nature by the nature being
[9:52] right and when the nature of sin came in
[9:55] then none of these relationships can be
[9:58] perfectly right although we have a lot
[10:00] of self-help we have a lot of things and
[10:03] uh I I I only against that if it becomes
[10:07] an alternative to God that's where we're
[10:09] against it we thank God for every good
[10:12] thing that can help somebody I'm not
[10:13] going to condemn but some marriage
[10:15] counselor helps a marriage get to be a
[10:17] better marriage I say praise the Lord
[10:19] for that we don't want to get arrogant
[10:21] and proud and say you know we're the
[10:23] only ones that have the answer here God
[10:25] has the answer but God may use someone
[10:28] else can you say Amen to do it so that's
[10:30] my attitude towards those things but we
[10:32] never want want any of those things to
[10:34] be an alternative for not receiving the
[10:36] change of nature because none of those
[10:38] things will bring it in such an original
[10:40] form and a pure form from the very soul
[10:44] of us God changing and getting ready to
[10:46] sin in our nature that's when you're
[10:48] talking relationships are going to get
[10:50] really good
[10:52] they should
[10:53] because you're dealing with it from a
[10:55] nature on the inside
[10:57] amen Amen brother Paul
[11:00] so now Paul picks it up here in the Book
[11:03] of Romans and some of these issues in
[11:06] the scripture some of these things I get
[11:07] on it's hard to hold back preaching but
[11:09] I would just like to do teaching tonight
[11:12] it's hard to hold back and not preach
[11:13] them
[11:14] so I'm going to be a Treacher
[11:17] that's what they call it
[11:20] so Paul brings it in Romans now after
[11:23] the book of Acts we find Romans comes up
[11:26] and at the end of the book of Romans
[11:27] here in Romans chapter 12. it's it's I
[11:31] want to delve into it because the first
[11:33] time that Paul mentions the term we
[11:38] should present our bodies this term a
[11:40] Living Sacrifice now nobody had ever
[11:43] heard that term before it's the first
[11:45] time it's been under revelation of God
[11:46] Paul introduces us speaking I wonder
[11:49] some of the Saints are saying wow never
[11:51] heard that before and it might have been
[11:53] a little confusing at first to realize
[11:55] they only knew one sacrifice that was
[11:58] done and that was at Calvary and they
[12:00] celebrated that and they worshiped under
[12:01] it and they knew they could have never
[12:04] been where they're at by the Holy Ghost
[12:05] except Christ made the sacrifice in
[12:07] Calvary and how many knows he does that
[12:09] once and for all it took care of all sin
[12:12] at Calvary one sacrifice once and for
[12:15] all it was over so they believed that
[12:16] they they got together and had the
[12:18] Lord's Supper quite frequently now never
[12:20] forgetting what the Lord did for his
[12:22] sacrifice so when Paul brings up this
[12:25] term we should present our bodies
[12:28] he didn't say a sacrifice again he
[12:30] didn't say we're going to die again but
[12:32] he actually called it a Living Sacrifice
[12:35] a Living Sacrifice so there's a mystery
[12:39] in the suffering of Christ that we will
[12:42] live out that will not be dealing with
[12:44] sin in the nature of sin but we will
[12:47] that's quite a deep term a Living
[12:49] Sacrifice and they as they were familiar
[12:52] with Christ's sacrifice but but it does
[12:55] not eliminate us entering into
[12:58] sufferings and a surrender in our life
[13:01] and our bodies that glorify and continue
[13:04] to glorify God
[13:07] you think about it a minute
[13:09] these are sinborne bodies God brings us
[13:12] the Holy Ghost and puts it actually
[13:15] justifies a man sanctifies them in his
[13:18] soul now Justified sanctifies them
[13:22] glorify him he's already glorified
[13:25] in a soul level
[13:27] he's already seated in Heavenly places
[13:29] in Jesus Christ in his soul
[13:31] already entered into heavy places and
[13:34] you put that now in a sinborn body that
[13:37] can never be born again
[13:40] now the battle starts
[13:43] now the battle starts and so now you put
[13:46] it in a sinborne body who doesn't know
[13:48] the ways of God doesn't want the ways of
[13:50] God will never want it and you got this
[13:52] Holy Ghost down on the inside okay
[13:54] friends there's a there's a new sheriff
[13:56] in town
[13:58] there's a new headship here there's a
[14:00] new King sitting on the throne everybody
[14:02] get an order now because this body is
[14:05] going to come under subjection to the
[14:07] king that's sitting on the throne
[14:09] there's a new sheriff in town There's a
[14:10] new king and so now you're all going to
[14:12] come under subjection this you may do it
[14:15] quickly or you may take years to do it
[14:17] but you're all going to bring because
[14:19] this this this brother or sister is
[14:22] saying I want to live by the Holy Ghost
[14:24] I want to live in the spirit and if
[14:26] they're saying things like that and
[14:27] moving into it now this body realizes oh
[14:30] my goodness they're surrendering they're
[14:32] yielding I've got to bring this whole
[14:34] body under subjection to what the word
[14:37] says
[14:38] and but it's not an easy thing
[14:41] because this flesh will never be born
[14:43] again like it is in the soul this flesh
[14:46] shall never be glorified right it'll
[14:48] never come to that state where the soul
[14:50] is so thus we come we come to the real
[14:53] battle sometimes of a Christian every
[14:55] day and so now Paul introduces we should
[14:59] become a liberty it means when I say it
[15:01] again that knowing what Christ did for
[15:04] us does not eliminate us entering into
[15:08] sufferings
[15:09] and surrendering in our life and
[15:12] surrendering our bodies that they would
[15:15] glorify God you think about this now
[15:17] this is what point I wanted to get to
[15:18] think about how much Glory it's going to
[15:20] bring to God that he would actually so
[15:22] consume by the Holy Spirit a sin-born
[15:25] body that a body that doesn't ever want
[15:28] to serve the Lord or have the desire to
[15:30] do it comes under subjection to God and
[15:33] ends its life with bringing glory all to
[15:37] God
[15:37] not smoking and drinking and glorifying
[15:40] the devil and glorifying sin and the
[15:42] songs of the world there's going to be
[15:44] plenty of lives do that but there's
[15:46] going to be some lives that have those
[15:48] sin-borne bodies and have the potential
[15:50] to do all that and they're going to end
[15:52] up bringing complete glory to almighty
[15:54] God I want to be one of those I want my
[15:58] body to bring glorified glory glory to
[16:00] God
[16:01] amen so now we enter into sufferings in
[16:05] the surrender in our life nobody else is
[16:06] entering into that but this Living
[16:07] Sacrifice so and I want to say this is
[16:10] not to be forced
[16:11] we willingly come and present ourselves
[16:14] Paul said to present yourselves he
[16:16] didn't say I'm going to come and get you
[16:18] and present you you present yourself you
[16:21] you bring your life up to God as a
[16:23] Living Sacrifice like Isaac did to
[16:26] Abraham that day a little boy he he was
[16:29] a type of Christ let me believe Isaac
[16:30] was a type of Christ he was going to
[16:32] become a sacrifice and he willingly
[16:34] stepped up to come up on the altar
[16:36] because his dad uh it was being so
[16:39] surrendered and so obedient to God so
[16:42] completely I trust you he said take your
[16:45] son your only son from from your wife
[16:49] Sarah and from you came came from you
[16:51] take him and put him up and sacrifice
[16:54] them to me and and Abraham's just you
[16:57] talk about a complete trust in God he's
[16:59] got a complete trust all right I'm doing
[17:01] it and tells his son Isaac get up in the
[17:03] Altar and because of Daddy's trust in
[17:06] God Isaac also have the same trust in
[17:09] God to get up willingly and offer
[17:12] himself willingly just like Jesus did at
[17:15] Calvary he willingly he had he had his
[17:18] own will he said if it be possible let
[17:21] this cup pass from me he could have
[17:22] turned it down but he willingly
[17:24] presented himself to all the authorities
[17:27] that day he knew what they were going to
[17:29] do to him and he presented himself he
[17:32] wasn't being forced to go to the cross
[17:36] but he willingly did it
[17:38] and this is what it looks like in us too
[17:41] that we will only come we're not forced
[17:43] to do it he to get us surrender and
[17:46] Abraham did not have to chase Isaac the
[17:49] rest of his life to get him to surrender
[17:51] he didn't have to chase him around the
[17:53] the desert Come On Son get up here come
[17:56] on and he's chasing her you got to do
[17:57] this God said do it you have to chase
[17:59] Isaac there's no scripture for that
[18:01] he willingly presented his body
[18:05] to his father praise the Lord he trusted
[18:08] God like his father trusted and he got
[18:11] up
[18:12] all right everybody's quiet he got up on
[18:15] the dentist chair
[18:18] next last Wednesday night listen to it
[18:21] the son
[18:23] willingly got up on the dentist chair
[18:25] because Dad said it's gonna be okay
[18:33] this is going to be for your good
[18:36] he willingly got up because he had the
[18:38] same trust daddy the dentist is going to
[18:41] help you you're going to go through some
[18:43] pain but in the long run it's going to
[18:45] be good and he trusts the the father's
[18:47] trust the son how many wants the same
[18:49] trust that Christ had going to Calvary
[18:52] amen you got to trust God you got to
[18:55] trust God so he willingly he comes up
[18:57] and he he he Abraham didn't have to
[18:59] chase him but he willingly gets up into
[19:01] the dentist chair it's going to be for
[19:03] your good there is no resistance to the
[19:07] king
[19:08] like vashti had
[19:13] that took an Esther there's no
[19:15] resistance to the king
[19:16] but vashti had a resistance to the king
[19:19] so there has to be a willingness there
[19:21] has to be a surrender there has to be a
[19:24] trust
[19:26] so praise the Lord
[19:28] he willingly offered and this is what
[19:30] Paul said that you present yours present
[19:33] your bodies present you present
[19:36] you present your bodies a Living
[19:38] Sacrifice
[19:40] holy unto God which is your if you have
[19:42] your Bible still open if you have it up
[19:43] there you can read it but I'm just going
[19:44] to clip along here in these scriptures
[19:46] I'm just breaking these down tonight so
[19:48] we understand a little better so now
[19:50] it's amazing that in in this chapter he
[19:53] deals with the relationship with others
[19:54] most of this chapter in Romans 12 deals
[19:57] with uh interacting with the body of
[19:59] Christ interacting with others and even
[20:01] mentions uh there picking it up talking
[20:04] about bless them which persecute you so
[20:07] that's relationship that's the ones that
[20:09] are you're around that's persecuting you
[20:12] um there he mentions recompense no evil
[20:15] no man evil for evil don't try to find
[20:17] me here I'm all over the place in Romans
[20:19] here right now but uh avenge not
[20:22] yourself so you have that tendency to
[20:24] want to they did me wrong I'm going to
[20:26] get them back
[20:27] and God says lead the Vengeance to me
[20:30] then Jesus's mind say the Lord so this
[20:32] is about relationships
[20:34] it's about interacting with not just
[20:35] Believers but people
[20:38] so what's amazing to me is the entire
[20:40] Romans 12 the entire thing has the theme
[20:44] of relationships with other people and
[20:47] he starts the theme with offering
[20:50] yourself as a Living Sacrifice
[20:54] and that teaches us that relationships
[20:57] will call on this thing of sacrifice all
[21:02] the time
[21:04] good the reason he presents presents
[21:06] your body as a Living Sacrifice and then
[21:08] he talks about relationship with us
[21:09] because if you're going to have good
[21:11] relationships and you're going to have
[21:12] right relationships you will and never
[21:14] eliminate sacrificing yourself
[21:17] you're listening marriages you're never
[21:19] going to eliminate sacrifice in your own
[21:22] wants and wishes sometimes and
[21:23] sacrificing yourself to make that
[21:25] relationship work in the marriage
[21:27] there's going to be sacrifice involved
[21:29] that's why people sixty percent bail out
[21:31] and get a divorce now because why I
[21:34] don't have to sacrifice I'm not going to
[21:35] do this and I I married her for this or
[21:37] I married him for that all the
[21:40] christ-like sacrifices eliminated and
[21:42] you can never do that with relationships
[21:44] friendships marriages families brothers
[21:48] and sisters whatever it is Paul says
[21:51] before he talks about these
[21:52] relationships present your body a Living
[21:55] Sacrifice because it will be you
[21:58] sacrificing yourself to make the
[22:00] relationships correct
[22:02] is that okay
[22:04] so now he teaches he starts it off with
[22:07] that in verse 2
[22:09] and be not TR conformed to this world
[22:11] but be transformed by the renewing of
[22:14] your mind that ye may prove what is that
[22:15] good and acceptable and perfect will of
[22:17] God so right away in the second verse
[22:19] and this is one of the best places to
[22:21] express a lot of what I believe on
[22:23] something and that is when he says that
[22:26] to be not conform this word but be ye
[22:27] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[22:30] those two words speak to me I don't know
[22:33] if they do to you but they speak to me
[22:35] transformed is a is a change by the
[22:39] renewing of your mind both those words
[22:41] tell me this is not just one night in an
[22:44] altar and everything's done in an altar
[22:46] can you say man this is the growth to
[22:49] maturity
[22:50] this is so God begins his work in you
[22:53] you become a Living Sacrifice because if
[22:56] there wasn't more to do why would Paul
[22:58] teach on you presenting your body as a
[23:00] Living Sacrifice it's done at Calvary
[23:02] it's done it's over I'm as good and in
[23:04] heaven good as in in heaven remember
[23:06] that guy talked to him a long time I I
[23:08] was at a concert and went back and
[23:09] around I don't know if he was singing or
[23:11] what but he's in the back of a van there
[23:13] in the back backstage and he's smoking a
[23:15] cigarette and I knew that he got up
[23:17] there and talked all about God and I
[23:18] said what are you doing there you know
[23:19] and he was a I think a Baptist man he
[23:22] said I'm perfectly fine I'm saved
[23:24] Sanctified gonna go to Heaven someday be
[23:27] with my Lord someday instead of smoking
[23:29] a cigarette I said I'm sorry sir that
[23:30] that just that doesn't work but I just
[23:32] left it alone because that's how he's
[23:33] been taught that's how he looks at it
[23:36] that there's there's hardly any
[23:37] surrender in the body when you come down
[23:40] to Romans 12 and he says no it's not
[23:42] over just at Calvary from here on out we
[23:45] start surrendering ourselves more and
[23:47] more so this is a growth this is not one
[23:49] night in an altar and it's all done I'm
[23:52] headed in a Rapture and I basically can
[23:54] treat other people the way that I want
[23:56] to treat them I can basically keep my
[23:58] anger and resentment toward somebody it
[24:00] doesn't matter that's not what Paul's
[24:02] saying and he's saying we're being
[24:04] transformed we're being renewed in our
[24:07] minds can you say Amen
[24:10] so uh and I love this because it's in
[24:14] this word of transformation a changing
[24:16] of the mind and the prophet brings it in
[24:19] for some messages on called The Power of
[24:22] transformation in 1965 and he reads this
[24:26] same scripture Romans 12. remember it's
[24:28] the end of 65 and this is how he
[24:31] introduces the subject remember the
[24:32] subject is going to be a seed when
[24:34] you're talking about a seed he lays in
[24:35] the seed be transformed by the renew of
[24:37] your mind now you that you're a seed
[24:40] then that seed is going to go through a
[24:42] process through the right water through
[24:45] the right environment that seed has to
[24:47] grow
[24:49] that seed will be if if God
[24:52] predestinated that seed to be something
[24:55] no matter what seed it is it's the
[24:58] potential is all in that seed when it's
[25:02] there I put up some apples to you some
[25:04] apple seeds one day and all the
[25:06] potential for some 12 000 apples from
[25:09] one seed all those apples lay in that
[25:11] one seed all the potential lays there
[25:13] but you can't see it yet what it's got
[25:15] to be supplanted it becomes a Seedling
[25:17] it comes up there's no apples yet it
[25:19] grows out of the ground there's no
[25:20] apples yet it grows up a tree there's no
[25:22] apples yet it grows up into branches
[25:25] there's no apples yet and now all of a
[25:27] sudden something pops out of the
[25:28] branches and you get to see what it was
[25:30] meant for the fruit of it
[25:32] that didn't happen overnight
[25:36] that seed began to transform Itself by a
[25:40] predestinated plan if you're a seed of
[25:42] God here tonight all the potential of
[25:44] God already lays within you
[25:47] is that what the word teaches
[25:49] it and I taught it to the brothers the
[25:52] potentials that the potentials of Christ
[25:54] taught to the brothers last weekend or
[25:57] two weekends ago at the men's meeting
[25:58] Brothers you know all those apples and
[26:01] I'll go ahead and tell the story because
[26:03] if you many of you weren't there of
[26:05] course I brought up a whole basket of
[26:07] apples in front of them and they had to
[26:09] get rid of them so I just started
[26:11] throwing apples at the brothers
[26:13] right in that conference room I hit the
[26:16] ceiling and one cracked and spilled over
[26:18] a guy that was bald
[26:20] it didn't work out so well but I just
[26:22] told him I'm not a polished preacher who
[26:24] has a bunch of PowerPoints I said this
[26:26] is my visual and I started throwing
[26:28] apples at him so they would remember and
[26:30] I guarantee you they won't ever forget
[26:31] an apple being splattered down on
[26:33] somebody it'll never forget that that's
[26:36] my visuals started throwing them out
[26:38] throwing a Gideon but you know what it's
[26:40] to get the point across if that's true
[26:43] in the natural it's certainly true in
[26:44] the spiritual you have potentials laying
[26:46] within you but they don't come out
[26:48] overnight
[26:50] they don't come out one night in an
[26:52] altar they come out as you go through
[26:54] the sufferings and the surrendering with
[26:56] Christ as you go through that then more
[26:59] of those that fruit comes out
[27:01] so this is the way I believe it and so
[27:03] this is a a quote a paragraph if you
[27:07] guys have it that I have read as soon as
[27:10] he reads the scriptures this is what
[27:11] brother Graham said and I've read this
[27:12] quote over and over for years now that
[27:15] this he says as soon as he reads the
[27:17] scripture now that we have been saved as
[27:20] we are and that we have been filled with
[27:22] the Holy Ghost as we have now now we
[27:25] want the mind that was in Christ to be
[27:29] in us that we might be transformed from
[27:33] the Natural Things of life and be
[27:35] brought into the perf what's that that's
[27:39] a growth
[27:40] that we be brought into the perfect will
[27:44] of God by transformation of God's spirit
[27:48] by his word now my subject is the power
[27:51] of transforming transformation
[27:53] I've read that over and over again for
[27:56] years because why it it speaks of a
[27:59] growth it doesn't speak of a one-time
[28:01] event
[28:03] when your Nature's change it's a
[28:04] moment's event
[28:06] filled with the Holy Ghost but now we
[28:08] get to see if the real thing is there as
[28:11] you surrender to him we get to be able
[28:13] to see uh and it's kind of like bringing
[28:16] up Isaac running because you know you
[28:19] got to present yourself God wants you to
[28:21] present yourself but there are some
[28:22] people that right away Lord here I am
[28:25] all of me I remember my dad laying his
[28:27] watching as billfold on the altar my
[28:29] money's yours my time is yours he laid
[28:32] it all and boy did he have surrender mom
[28:34] and I were having breakfast this morning
[28:35] and you know we talked about the good
[28:37] jobs that he had in the factories up
[28:39] here in Michigan opportunities and when
[28:41] God kept calling to the ministry he laid
[28:43] it all aside went into full-time
[28:45] Ministry and God blessed that because he
[28:47] obeyed the will of God
[28:49] amen but you see now there's some people
[28:53] that just right away
[28:55] all right I'm all yours Lord do what
[28:57] with me what you want but there might be
[28:59] some Isaacs that are running through the
[29:01] desert
[29:03] and they know they need to come and
[29:04] present themselves but it's years
[29:05] sometimes before because they're trying
[29:08] to get around that full surrender and if
[29:10] they're son and daughter of God you can
[29:11] run but you can't hide
[29:14] you better off to say okay I'm here I'm
[29:17] Yours Lord what do you want to do with
[29:19] me
[29:20] this thing doesn't get by without a
[29:21] complete surrender can you say Amen can
[29:24] I hear you say Amen online
[29:26] how about online amen you're not going
[29:29] to get around this Joseph what came in
[29:31] as Christ came in charge of the entire
[29:34] land Joseph in the Bible and
[29:39] so God anointed him by a dream
[29:43] to get all the Harvest and start packing
[29:45] it in all these big vaults and these big
[29:48] things because God showed him was going
[29:50] to be a famine in the land well the
[29:52] famine actually ended up driving
[29:54] everybody to Egypt to be under Joseph's
[29:58] leadership
[30:00] so the famine came and more people came
[30:02] dependent on him even his own family his
[30:05] dad and his brothers now they're
[30:06] completely dependent on him and then
[30:09] this came and then a drought and then
[30:10] they had no money then they had to sell
[30:12] their cattle and they were they were
[30:13] they were left with nothing why God's
[30:16] teaching that at the end of the day
[30:18] every knee shall bow and every tongue
[30:22] shall confess someday that he is Lord
[30:24] how many knows the Bible says that
[30:26] so you can come harder you come easy or
[30:30] you can you know go through tribulation
[30:32] but you see now every man is going to
[30:35] confess he's Lord someday
[30:37] and praise the Lord I like that so now
[30:40] he said now to to be brought into the
[30:43] perfect will of God by that quote be
[30:46] brought into the perfect will of God by
[30:48] so to be brought into his perfect will
[30:50] by God changing Us by changing our
[30:53] thinking and so we got just hints of
[30:56] this here is something here that we
[30:58] could say you could have the Holy Ghost
[31:00] but not be in his perfect will
[31:04] just because of your stinking thinking
[31:10] because he brother Brahm says he says
[31:13] transform from the Natural Things of
[31:14] life so it must be when we first come to
[31:17] the Lord and even get a genuine New
[31:18] Birth we're so naturally minded it's
[31:21] going to take God a long time to purge
[31:23] our minds on the way we think can you
[31:26] say Amen so that's where the
[31:28] transformation comes in Paul's the one
[31:30] who said it how do we transform brother
[31:31] Paul how are we transport Paul how are
[31:33] we transformed how we do it by the
[31:35] renewing of our minds God has to change
[31:38] our thinking about stuff because we're
[31:40] thinking about the natural things of
[31:41] life we need to be transformed so we can
[31:43] finally come in and delivered the
[31:45] perfect will of God so that tells me a
[31:48] person can be born again but not being
[31:50] his perfect will because of their
[31:52] stinking thinking because of the way
[31:54] they think and their stubbornness
[31:55] whatever it is they think about a
[31:57] certain way think about the natural
[31:59] things of life it's in the fight for
[32:01] years for it until God shows them
[32:03] something in the word say you need to
[32:04] quit fighting for prevent possessions
[32:06] you need to quit wearing yourself out
[32:09] running a business so bad and not
[32:11] putting God first you need to stop that
[32:13] and that Don's them oh my goodness I'm
[32:15] doing wrong I could be in his perfect
[32:17] will
[32:18] yeah you see and so I asked this tonight
[32:20] who's willing to say Lord I want to be
[32:23] not in your permissive will but your
[32:25] perfect will I want to be there
[32:28] praise the Lord
[32:30] the next verse says this and this is
[32:33] what all the verse in the Amplified so
[32:35] you can put it up there sister Genie but
[32:37] this is the Amplified so and do not be
[32:39] conformed to this world any longer with
[32:41] its superficial values and Customs but
[32:43] be transformed and progressively changed
[32:46] as you mature spiritually by the
[32:48] renewing of your mind focusing on Godly
[32:51] values and ethical attitudes so that you
[32:53] may prove to yourself for yourselves
[32:55] what the will of God is that which is
[32:57] good and acceptable and perfect in his
[33:00] plan and purpose for you how many you
[33:03] want to find his purpose for you right
[33:06] so we're transformed by the renew our
[33:07] mind and the the end result to that is
[33:09] not just to surrender but we start to
[33:11] fulfill his purpose for our lives what
[33:14] he wants to accomplish what his
[33:16] achievement is can you say Amen so and
[33:19] then it says verse 3 now for by the
[33:22] grace of God given to me I say to every
[33:25] one of you not to think more highly of
[33:28] himself and of his importance and his
[33:32] ability
[33:33] not to think more highly of himself of
[33:36] his own importance or ability that he
[33:38] ought to that he ought to think but to
[33:41] think
[33:42] um
[33:42] so as to have sound judgment as God has
[33:47] a portion to each a degree of faith and
[33:50] a purpose designed for service so now we
[33:54] start to come into relationship and he's
[33:57] saying that here's something through the
[33:59] grace was given to me here's a
[34:01] revelation given to me every man among
[34:03] you should not think of himself more
[34:05] highly than he ought to think why that
[34:08] that's not relationships after
[34:10] Redemption
[34:12] that actually originates in Lucifer
[34:16] to actually think in his mind when he
[34:18] comes into the atmosphere of God can you
[34:21] imagine this now he's allowed into the
[34:23] atmospheres of God he's one of the high
[34:25] Angels right hand man of God and Lucifer
[34:28] gets lifted up and all the time he's
[34:30] coming into the presence of the Lord
[34:32] he's got this thought I want to be
[34:35] worshiped like that
[34:37] I want to be acknowledged I am better
[34:41] than all these angels and I actually can
[34:44] see myself being in the high position
[34:46] above God he's thinking this
[34:50] and very later he carries it out that
[34:53] originates in Satan that's not
[34:56] relationships under Redemption
[34:59] humility is under Redemption can you say
[35:01] amen and the way he says it here is that
[35:04] uh he he's uh if you're going to have
[35:08] right relationships in the body of
[35:10] Christ you can't have a man or woman
[35:12] coming Among Us thinking of themselves
[35:15] more highly than they ought to think
[35:19] um coming with an heir about you
[35:22] or your nose in the air
[35:25] that you're better
[35:26] when you coming in with that air about
[35:29] you will not work
[35:31] in relationships what I find is
[35:33] interesting and don't work with the
[35:35] church but then they go out to the world
[35:38] and they're going to be resisted as well
[35:41] they might get along with people a
[35:42] little bit better but eventually you'll
[35:44] see find a track record of a person
[35:46] that's all about themselves that all
[35:49] along the way relationships broke
[35:51] relationships broke because every
[35:52] atmosphere he goes into he thinks of
[35:54] himself more highly than he ought to
[35:56] think
[35:57] loses jobs he you know I know fellas
[36:00] that every time they go into a job this
[36:03] is like 30 years ago every time they go
[36:05] into a new job within days they're
[36:07] telling me that they can run the company
[36:09] better than the owner that's had it for
[36:10] 30 years
[36:12] and they got all new ideas about how
[36:14] they if they change this and if they do
[36:16] this this would be right and I always
[36:17] want to tell them you know you only just
[36:20] just be humble and do what the boss
[36:22] tells you to do
[36:27] and if the boss invites you in asking
[36:29] for your ideas praise the Lord then give
[36:31] them but they leave they leave they
[36:35] leave because they have a mindset they
[36:37] think of themselves more highly than
[36:38] everybody their gifts are a special gift
[36:41] from God and nobody knows what they know
[36:43] and so everybody needs to come to them
[36:46] and ask for advice and they go from job
[36:48] to job and they have a track record of
[36:50] doing that so even in the world it
[36:52] doesn't work but for certainly in the
[36:53] body of Christ you can't come with an
[36:55] heir about you that your family's better
[36:57] or that you're better with your nose in
[36:59] the air uh you know it won't work around
[37:03] the presence of the Lord hey I've been
[37:06] around I know more than a lot of you you
[37:10] all need me
[37:12] I hope you can acknowledge my gifts that
[37:14] I have and my expertise I'm really good
[37:17] if you don't see how good I am I may
[37:19] have to just move on eventually that's
[37:21] where you see sometimes people go quite
[37:23] often from church to church and the
[37:26] church all okay I'm saying it the church
[37:29] when people go from church to church the
[37:31] church and the church Administration
[37:33] always is the problem
[37:37] in some cases they're that way but when
[37:39] you have a track record and it's always
[37:41] the church became the problem the church
[37:43] did us wrong
[37:45] it's time to look in the mirror
[37:47] something wrong
[37:49] because it can't be every Church
[37:52] something definitely wrong with that so
[37:54] A lot of times if they don't acknowledge
[37:56] my gifts they don't acknowledge my
[37:57] expertise I'm good I know I'm good I
[38:00] know
[38:02] if you don't see how good I am I may
[38:04] have to move on and I need to move on on
[38:06] this subject I guess I've got something
[38:08] here that really is Head and Shoulders
[38:11] above all the others in this
[38:12] congregation I know we think people come
[38:15] in and feel they can never measure up
[38:17] everyone you think well most people come
[38:19] in they think they never measure up to
[38:20] everybody they're below everyone that's
[38:23] really rare most the time it's Pride
[38:25] that comes and we have a lot of
[38:27] know-it-alls that got it figured out
[38:29] already
[38:30] I remember a preacher I won't say his
[38:33] name but you know after a lot of years
[38:35] he said you know some of you have moved
[38:37] here thinking that God sent you here to
[38:39] correct me as the pastor but he said I
[38:42] want to let you know God sent you here
[38:44] not for you to correct me but for me to
[38:46] correct you
[38:48] I've never said that
[38:50] that's pretty bold
[38:52] I've thought it
[38:56] because people come with already I got
[38:58] everything I need to correct this the
[39:00] quotes and he's off here and everything
[39:02] and that just the entrance to that just
[39:04] doesn't sit well with me
[39:06] or with anybody you have to come in
[39:08] humbly and I'm going to get to the the
[39:10] kernel of such a powerful truth that
[39:13] Paul gives us here but let me finish
[39:15] this when you you see now uh when you
[39:18] come with that attitude you got it all
[39:19] figured out it's not the right entrance
[39:21] and Paul's going to be deal what is he
[39:23] dealing with relationships
[39:25] relationship that thinking that says
[39:28] that I I'm thinking a little bit higher
[39:30] than I ought to think of myself it's
[39:32] none of this works and the way to
[39:34] approach it is to think soberly and
[39:36] sound Paul says knowing this
[39:39] here's here's the Rev I'll go ahead and
[39:40] give the revelation of it everyone
[39:42] that's around you look around you right
[39:45] now in this congregation look around you
[39:47] everyone that's around you
[39:49] God has deposited a measure of himself
[39:53] within them
[39:58] and you need to look at it that way or
[40:01] relationships with people in the body
[40:03] will always turn bad
[40:07] every person you say well I don't know
[40:09] who has a birth and I don't listen no we
[40:11] don't know that okay we have
[40:13] characteristics we can see but we don't
[40:15] have a right to put them in a category
[40:16] and say where they're at we're supposed
[40:19] to look at it that when we come in we
[40:21] don't think more highly than we think of
[40:24] ourselves but think soberly that God has
[40:27] dealt Every Man a measure
[40:31] and so if that's true then when I look
[40:33] at everybody then I'm saying not highly
[40:35] enough I'm saying they have a portion
[40:38] within themselves here's humility
[40:40] everybody has something within them that
[40:44] I need
[40:46] that's humility
[40:47] and don't get hung up on their
[40:49] personality if there's a measure of
[40:50] Christ in them you need that measure of
[40:52] Christ
[40:53] you need it then no no I'm so sufficient
[40:55] I know enough I know that person no ever
[40:58] he says God has dealt with every man
[41:00] let's just take that for a minute how
[41:02] many just would just say I want to
[41:04] believe and when I walk around that God
[41:06] has doubt we know that's the truth that
[41:08] people wouldn't be sitting here unless
[41:10] God has dealt with every man and woman
[41:12] here there's something God's done in
[41:14] their life no matter how small God has
[41:16] dealt with them and it may not be the
[41:18] way God dealt with you and they may not
[41:20] have as much knowledge of you as the
[41:22] message they might just barely be around
[41:25] the message and not know all the years
[41:27] of things that you've heard over the
[41:29] pulpit but we're never supposed to look
[41:31] at them as less but something that we
[41:34] need in the body of Christ there's a
[41:36] measure of Christ that we need there
[41:37] instead of we don't need them instead of
[41:40] they don't know very much
[41:43] I'm watching this sister be baptized
[41:45] last Sunday that I'm rejoicing in as she
[41:48] comes and hears the word of God I'm
[41:50] watching a transformation take place in
[41:52] her life and it's a joy that's seeing
[41:54] the glory of God in people and it's
[41:56] happened to so many Through The Years
[41:58] here with all the church politics and
[42:01] all the stuff that goes on get your eyes
[42:02] off of that and look at the glory of God
[42:04] taking somebody with you it's amazing to
[42:06] me and I don't know if she's listening
[42:08] tonight she had to go to Florida there
[42:09] her husband to fix their house and such
[42:12] but my I'm just seeing how God I have
[42:15] never had to go to her and talk to her
[42:18] personally about you know this and what
[42:20] to wear I've never had to do that
[42:24] God
[42:25] there's no resistance
[42:28] God changes the life
[42:30] God does it and God has dealt with every
[42:33] man don't belittle how God has dealt
[42:36] with everybody
[42:37] not only has he dealt with each one
[42:41] but he says he's dealt to every man a
[42:44] Measure of Faith
[42:47] so when you look at someone you should
[42:49] think God has deposited I would love
[42:51] tonight for you if you don't get
[42:52] anything else to get this so when you
[42:53] come around the people of God you look
[42:56] at every one of them say God
[42:58] Mighty the mighty super Supernatural God
[43:00] has deposited something in that person
[43:02] that I need and I am better with it than
[43:06] I am without it
[43:10] instead of thoughts like I'm just better
[43:12] that's all there is to it
[43:15] remember this is your thinking
[43:18] this is what people think people never
[43:20] come and say things like
[43:22] um I'm more High than the rest
[43:25] I just want to let everybody they never
[43:27] say that Paul says for a man not to
[43:31] think himself
[43:33] more highly
[43:36] people never speak I'm better than you
[43:38] it'd be a pretty extreme person that
[43:40] just basically says Brandon I'm better
[43:41] than you
[43:42] you just need to know it it's usually
[43:44] what people are thinking but God knows
[43:46] what you're thinking
[43:48] so it's what people are thinking instead
[43:50] of the thoughts like I'm just better
[43:53] and it's in your thinking no one ever
[43:55] says the words but I'm just better than
[43:57] all of you it shows in their actions but
[43:59] it's in their thinking and that won't
[44:00] work in Christ's like relationships can
[44:04] you say Amen
[44:06] the next verse says
[44:09] I mean that's that's powerful we should
[44:10] we could just stop right there and pray
[44:12] about it
[44:13] when you come amongst the body of Christ
[44:16] let's look at everyone as they have a
[44:19] deposit and a Measure of Faith they have
[44:21] something within them that we need
[44:25] let's not get into this measuring you
[44:27] know we could talk a lot about preachers
[44:28] thinking how effective their gift is
[44:31] and the ones that think that they're
[44:33] supreme or they're Superior or they're
[44:37] are probably not as great as
[44:40] they think they are
[44:43] because for sheep humility is the thing
[44:47] today that speaks more than anything
[44:50] humbling yourself so we get up you know
[44:53] and we get these things going on amongst
[44:55] preachers and I think we should grow
[44:58] beyond that and recognize it's not just
[45:01] the preachers they have gifts of the
[45:02] fivefold ministry but I have a I have a
[45:05] deeper gift in me that's than to preach
[45:08] of a pastor I have a gift of a pastor
[45:10] he's given me
[45:12] God gave it to me I didn't get I didn't
[45:13] go training for it God gave it to me
[45:15] okay but I have a deeper gift with me
[45:17] and a measure of Christ that that lays
[45:19] aside the gift for singing writing songs
[45:22] preaching I have a measure of Christ
[45:24] within me and that's the most important
[45:26] one
[45:28] right but I don't have a measure of
[45:30] Christ that's better than yours
[45:34] right
[45:37] amen
[45:40] I in my gifts to preach I may be able to
[45:43] preach better than brother Tom
[45:45] but I can't lead a sports team like him
[45:47] that is for sure
[45:50] I'd be too wore out first of all
[45:53] but nobody can lead us Sports and kids
[45:55] in sports like brother Tom I wouldn't
[45:57] even touch it he you see and so that
[45:59] means that means we each have an
[46:01] individual gifts that we are he may not
[46:03] be able to write a song but I can't do
[46:05] some of the things that he does those
[46:07] are gifts that God gives us but as far
[46:09] as the measure of Christ it's the same
[46:13] and people need to be treated that way
[46:16] amen
[46:18] the next verse says in verse 4
[46:23] . well let's finish this so he goes on
[46:25] with the subject for as we have many
[46:26] members in one body and all members have
[46:29] not the same office so we being many are
[46:31] one body in Christ and everyone
[46:33] remembers one of another he picks up the
[46:35] same subject in First Corinthians we
[46:37] know that when he talks about a natural
[46:38] body spiritual body we being many are
[46:41] one body in Christ and everyone members
[46:42] of One Another We're members of one
[46:44] another having them gifts differing
[46:46] according to the grace that is given to
[46:48] us whether prophecy let us prophesy
[46:50] according to the proportion of Faith or
[46:52] Ministry let us wait on our ministering
[46:54] or he that teacheth on teaching or he
[46:56] that exhorteth on exhortation he that
[46:58] giveth let him do it with simplicity so
[47:00] it's listing a bunch of things here and
[47:02] there really slats within the body that
[47:05] someone that someone gets I Minister on
[47:07] these things before and broke every one
[47:09] of them down because you'll see this in
[47:11] the body that there's different bents in
[47:13] somebody and they'll slowly find that
[47:15] bent in the body of Christ and begin
[47:16] doing that person just gifted at giving
[47:18] giving giving and doing things and you
[47:21] know volunteering and different things
[47:22] they don't do it because they're told
[47:24] they just start doing it because they're
[47:26] gifted to that in the body of Christ
[47:27] that measure God gave him them of Christ
[47:30] in them has a certain bent to it
[47:33] right
[47:34] so if everybody finds their place then
[47:36] once everybody finds their place then
[47:37] everybody respects listen I can't do
[47:40] what that person does like them but I'm
[47:41] going to support them get behind them we
[47:43] want to see all those gifts working in
[47:44] the church we have a lovely group of
[47:46] people here the people have found many
[47:48] have found their gifts they're finding
[47:50] gifts and it works in continuity helps
[47:52] me as a pastor a lot assistant pastor
[47:54] it's just a wonderful group that we have
[47:56] here of different ones finding their
[47:58] little niche as it was
[48:01] and some of that may not be here visible
[48:03] for every service like the video people
[48:06] and the audio people some of it may be
[48:08] gifted to as an exhortation to somebody
[48:10] outside of a service they're given an
[48:12] exhortation to somebody God gave them a
[48:14] dream to give to somebody so there's a
[48:16] lot work of the Holy Spirit going on not
[48:17] just in the services
[48:19] amen
[48:21] he that ruleth with diligent he that
[48:23] showeth Mercy with cheerfulness so you
[48:24] can study that on your own it just shows
[48:25] the variety of different ways God uses
[48:28] different ones and we need to respect
[48:29] that we need to don't think that need to
[48:31] think that our gift is better or at a
[48:33] better level we don't need to think that
[48:35] way matter of fact the one that comes to
[48:37] higher popularity needs to become more
[48:39] of a servant all along and more humble
[48:41] verse 9 is what I want to get to before
[48:43] we close tonight
[48:45] and I won't be long let love be without
[48:48] dissimulation
[48:50] abhor that which is evil cleave to that
[48:53] which is good so I want to concentrate
[48:55] on this Let Your Love be without
[48:58] dissimulation
[49:00] what does dissimulation mean I'm glad
[49:03] you asked
[49:05] dissimulation means hypocrisy
[49:08] when you love when you express love
[49:11] always have it without hypocrisy
[49:16] don't express it with anything tainted
[49:19] to it so you can imagine now Redemption
[49:22] relationships after Redemption is a pure
[49:25] love Fountain fountain flowing from God
[49:27] flowing into us and when we express that
[49:30] love it doesn't need to come through our
[49:32] mind and come through our prejudice and
[49:34] it doesn't need to be selective it
[49:36] doesn't need to come through any filters
[49:38] no the love of God comes out from the
[49:40] Fountain of God coming out of us and
[49:42] needs to be with no hypocrisy in it it
[49:45] needs to be real can you say Amen love
[49:48] one another without hypocrisy this is
[49:51] what the Holy Ghost brings
[49:53] relationships without phoniness without
[49:57] hiding and without being Too Faced
[50:02] brother Burley calls it to Facebook not
[50:05] Facebook to Facebook and he says that
[50:08] because people will be two-faced there's
[50:10] something in church there's somebody in
[50:12] church different than what they post
[50:14] online sometimes they're two-faced is
[50:16] this the same person I don't know so
[50:18] that's what he calls it so anyway uh but
[50:21] hiding relationship without phonies
[50:23] without hiding without being Too Faced
[50:25] This is Love Without dissimulation love
[50:28] when expressed must be pure and from the
[50:32] pure Fountain of God it cannot have any
[50:35] carnal editions or agendas with it
[50:39] the love of God
[50:41] as is expressed cannot have carnal
[50:44] additions to it or agendas or taken away
[50:47] from it it can't have racism
[50:52] love on his best can have cannot have
[50:54] racism in it it can have Prejudice in it
[50:58] it can't be selective
[51:01] is anybody hear what I'm saying tonight
[51:03] Paul's teaching not mine Let Your Love
[51:06] be without any phoniness or any
[51:08] taintedness any agendas not the
[51:11] selective thing loving certain ones and
[51:12] not loving the other it can't be with
[51:15] hypocrisy mixed with it it can't be just
[51:18] a pass of hate
[51:23] it can't be sloppy agape
[51:29] everybody's tired tonight so I have to
[51:30] let my jokes linger a while till you
[51:33] catch it
[51:34] can't be sloppy Agape it can't be
[51:37] passive hate it's got to be real genuine
[51:41] untainted pure love expressed to
[51:47] everyone
[51:50] unrestrained
[51:52] no hypocrisy not being Too Faced
[51:55] one writer says so when the Apostle Paul
[51:57] tells us to walk in love that is without
[51:59] dissimulation he means this and this is
[52:01] the way he worded the scripture if you
[52:03] are going to say you love someone
[52:05] then make sure you really love them
[52:10] don't give an impression that isn't true
[52:13] don't say one thing and then do another
[52:16] your love should be without hypocrisy so
[52:20] don't be phony when it comes to the
[52:23] subject of love
[52:25] the pure love of God doesn't need your
[52:28] tainted things added to it in your
[52:30] history your past of people doing you
[52:32] wrong that's the thing is we we put that
[52:34] on the new person we just met we take
[52:37] all of our past people that's hurt us
[52:39] and now we're going to be restricted
[52:40] because this person is bearing the blunt
[52:42] of everything that you've been through
[52:44] before that's not fair can you say Amen
[52:46] when we express the love of God that
[52:49] person deserves all of it expressed to
[52:50] them
[52:52] without being selective
[52:54] so I like the way he words it there and
[52:56] he goes on to say let me ask you a
[52:58] question as I bring this to a close
[52:59] tonight let me ask you a question have
[53:01] you ever been to faced with people who
[53:04] thought you were their friend
[53:07] did you say one thing to them but later
[53:09] talk behind their backs has anybody ever
[53:12] done that
[53:15] did you do exactly the same thing that
[53:17] someone else is doing to you right now
[53:19] is it possible that you are reaping what
[53:22] you have sown
[53:25] instead of getting bitter and
[53:28] hard-hearted towards someone who has
[53:30] acted hypocritically in his friendship
[53:32] with you learn from this experience make
[53:36] a decision that you will not be phony or
[53:39] hypocritical in your relationships the
[53:42] way this person has been to you
[53:44] meanwhile make sure you forgive those
[53:47] who have wronged you let it go and do
[53:50] your best to overlook their
[53:52] inconsistencies
[53:55] the Lord will probably deal with them
[53:57] about their actions so if they come to
[54:00] you in Repentance let them know that
[54:03] they are forgiven
[54:06] but most importantly let this be a time
[54:09] when you decide that you will not be
[54:12] guilty of giving a false impression to a
[54:17] friend let
[54:19] Your Love be real
[54:22] don't be a phony
[54:29] as I'm closing I read this
[54:32] by Brother Branham I like real love
[54:35] genuine love something that you can feel
[54:39] Paul Rader said one time brother Billy I
[54:41] was leaving my wife one morning said we
[54:43] were sitting at the table and I got up
[54:44] kind of on the wrong side of the bed and
[54:46] I'd said something to her I know that
[54:47] hurt her feelings and I said I never
[54:49] apologized and he said she said Paul
[54:52] will you go with me somewhere tonight
[54:53] and he said I can't he said I can't do
[54:56] it and just went on like that and said I
[54:58] was just in a meeting and had stirred I
[55:00] mean had me all stirred and I had to go
[55:02] to the office said you know how a fella
[55:04] gets said I I went out the door and I
[55:06] said she always met me at the door and
[55:07] kissed me goodbye said she was standing
[55:09] there when I kissed her I said goodbye
[55:11] and said she said goodbye and said I
[55:13] walked out on the end of the gate and
[55:15] said when I close the gate and looked
[55:16] back said she always waved her goodbye
[55:19] at me and I said I turned around and
[55:21] looked and I said goodbye and she said
[55:23] goodbye and said when I went on down the
[55:26] street I began to think about it
[55:29] said my how can I stand it said what if
[55:33] something happened to me today
[55:35] that's my sweetheart
[55:37] said I look I said something I ought on
[55:40] to said his heart got to swelling big
[55:43] turned around run back in real quick
[55:46] jerk the door open and looked around he
[55:48] heard somebody crying
[55:50] she was standing behind the door crying
[55:51] and said he looked around grabbed her by
[55:54] the shoulder pulled her around kissed
[55:57] her as big as he could like that walked
[55:59] out and shut the door went out the gate
[56:01] and said goodbye and she said goodbye he
[56:03] said just like she did the other time
[56:05] but the last time had feeling in it
[56:11] so that's the way it is about knowing
[56:13] Christ you can know him
[56:15] but as they're feeling a real a feeling
[56:18] of real love feeling a real Fellowship
[56:22] that's the way that's the secret to
[56:26] success that's the way it's a real
[56:29] genuine love that's just not put on
[56:32] that's not put on it's real and God
[56:35] knows it's real and so does Satan know
[56:38] it's real when you love the Lord with a
[56:41] real genuine love
[56:45] amen let's Stand Together
[56:50] precious Lord we thank you for this
[56:52] study tonight
[56:54] Lord we're always
[56:55] bringing our hearts to you to say I want
[56:58] to live that way I want to live the way
[56:59] that you want me to live not by duty but
[57:03] by the flowing Waters of divine love
[57:05] that comes from the soul
[57:08] now you mentioned it said in the great
[57:10] day of the feast out of man shall come
[57:12] flowing rivers of Living Water shall
[57:15] come out of him in that day
[57:17] and that's when the Holy Ghost will come
[57:19] because all these fountains that come
[57:20] from heaven now will be in the soul of
[57:22] Believers and everything that's pure and
[57:25] every good thing of God in every bit of
[57:28] the Divine love is going to flow through
[57:30] a group of people
[57:31] not from a book not from a tape
[57:34] not from a phone and not from a church
[57:38] that's going to flow from individuals
[57:41] so Lord Paul teaches us tonight that's
[57:44] still so relevant today that we should
[57:46] present our bodies a Living Sacrifice to
[57:49] you Lord willingly offer up and say it's
[57:52] a sacrifice and I'm going to give that
[57:54] sacrifice so that my relationship with
[57:57] you and my relationship with others
[57:59] would be better Lord
[58:01] then comes in the middle and says Let
[58:03] Your Love if you're going to express
[58:04] love Let It Love Without be without any
[58:07] hypocrisy with any without any phoniness
[58:10] without any racism or selective God help
[58:14] it to be purged of that and let it to be
[58:16] just pure just the way that you loved us
[58:19] and Lord let it have feeling in it as
[58:22] the prophet said let it not just be
[58:23] words I love you I love you I love you
[58:25] but let there be a great amount of
[58:27] flowing love that comes from the I love
[58:29] you
[58:30] great amount of feeling in it that we
[58:32] mean it when we say we love you when we
[58:35] say we love someone else let it be the
[58:38] expression of a real true meaning and
[58:41] feeling behind it granted Lord as we
[58:45] seek you in all things and seek to
[58:48] follow you each day
[58:50] we ask it in Jesus name amen
