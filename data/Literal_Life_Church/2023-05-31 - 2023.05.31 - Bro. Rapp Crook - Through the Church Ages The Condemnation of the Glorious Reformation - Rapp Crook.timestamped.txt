[0:00] just Brandon
[0:02] um
[0:03] my computer battery is kind of go I
[0:06] could use a my cord will be in the
[0:08] middle pocket of my backpack
[0:11] it seems like computers are like people
[0:13] the older they get the shorter the
[0:15] batteries last
[0:18] a couple weeks ago I took a school trip
[0:19] to Washington DC and I had 6 14 and 15
[0:23] year old guys in my hotel room and I
[0:26] thought hey one day we walked 20 000
[0:28] steps we saw everything you could see
[0:30] and I thought man these guys are going
[0:31] to sleep well tonight
[0:34] but they were still going at nine
[0:36] o'clock in the evening but man it's
[0:37] clear who's young and who's not and I
[0:40] was not
[0:42] let's get this set up real quick
[0:46] on setting here this is the Korean War
[0:49] Memorial that we saw while we were in DC
[0:52] and that's always an important place to
[0:54] visit
[1:05] there we go
[1:12] looks like we're in business
[1:25] still here
[1:28] we have it
[1:31] all right
[1:33] Revelation chapter 3 and verses 1
[1:36] through 6 is what we'll look at
[1:39] unto the angel of the church in Sardis
[1:42] right these things sat here they have
[1:44] the seven spirits of God
[1:47] and the Seven Stars I Know Thy works
[1:49] that thou Hast the name that thou livest
[1:52] and art dead Be watchful and strengthen
[1:55] the things which remain that are ready
[1:58] to die for I have not found thy works
[2:01] perfect before God
[2:04] remember therefore how thou Hast
[2:06] received and heard and hold fast and
[2:09] repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch
[2:12] I will come on thee as a thief and thou
[2:14] shalt not know what hour I will come
[2:16] upon thee
[2:18] thou Hast a few names even in Sardis
[2:20] which have not defiled their garments
[2:23] and they shall walk with me in white for
[2:25] they are worthy
[2:27] he could overcometh the same shall be
[2:29] clothed in white raiment and I will not
[2:31] blot out his name out of the book of
[2:33] life that will confess his name before
[2:35] my father and before his angels he that
[2:38] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[2:40] saith under the churches
[2:43] let's pray
[2:44] Heavenly Father we just ask your
[2:45] blessing upon our short little study
[2:48] this evening Lord I pray that you would
[2:50] help us to see how you worked in the
[2:52] past now you're working today and what
[2:53] your plan might even be in our lives
[2:55] father I pray that you would move in
[2:57] each one of our hearts father I pray you
[2:59] would answer questions that perhaps are
[3:02] on asked perhaps or aren't even since we
[3:04] can have questions aren't even quite
[3:06] sure how to phrase them yet Lord but I
[3:07] just pray that you would move on each
[3:08] one of our hearts oh God establish us
[3:11] and settle Us in the faith I pray in
[3:12] Jesus name amen God bless you may be
[3:15] seated
[3:18] um this evening we're going to start off
[3:19] I was kind of wasn't quite sure how to
[3:21] take this as probably the last uh
[3:24] service I'll be able to take until uh
[3:26] later on in the summer so I have a
[3:28] Hiatus probably almost two months and I
[3:30] thought hey should I take one session
[3:32] just kind of review everything we've
[3:33] we've done so far or start on with the
[3:35] sardisian age and I'm going to do the
[3:37] the latter we'll start off looking at
[3:40] the church age of of Sardis this is uh
[3:43] one that's familiar to us in the sense
[3:45] that the church age messenger the Sardis
[3:48] is one of the best known of them and
[3:49] that's a Martin Luther
[3:52] we can look back and historians look
[3:54] back at this time period and uh call it
[3:57] the Reformation how he goes up and they
[3:59] have the Protestant movement protesting
[4:01] uh Roman Catholicism and the abuses of
[4:04] power of the Catholic church had and
[4:07] um this time period some of the the men
[4:10] that God used in this time period
[4:12] whether it be Luther or Calvin or
[4:14] zwingli there are a number of men that
[4:16] God used we can look back and almost
[4:18] lionize them these are this real men of
[4:21] God and they were and uh and what the
[4:24] work they accomplished and you can look
[4:26] back and things can seem much more nice
[4:30] and neat than they actually were I can
[4:33] remember when I was reading through the
[4:34] church age book
[4:35] um preparing for the Sunday School
[4:36] classes uh a year and a half ago
[4:40] brother branham's going through this
[4:43] section in Revelation chapter three and
[4:45] you know Book of Revelation chapter 1
[4:47] says this is a book of Prophecy
[4:49] um John's looking uh cry Jesus is
[4:51] showing John how the New Testament
[4:53] Church is going to be going for the next
[4:55] couple thousand years it's a book of
[4:58] Prophecy
[4:59] and
[5:00] the way Revelation 3 describes this time
[5:03] period is much different than you would
[5:05] hear it described in a lot of church
[5:07] histories
[5:09] um
[5:11] in this case um brother branham's kind
[5:14] of summarizing here from Revelation 3 it
[5:16] says here indeed's a very strange thing
[5:18] in every age to this point the spirit
[5:21] has first of all praised the true
[5:22] believers
[5:24] and we've seen that we look at the
[5:25] message of the Ephesian age the the
[5:27] smyrnian ages there's these they're
[5:29] doing really well here doing really well
[5:31] here and really well here then we come
[5:33] to the age that we know a lot about all
[5:35] the great Reformation movement and
[5:38] there's hardly any phrase at all in
[5:41] Revelation chapter 3.
[5:43] all he's doing is basically denouncing
[5:46] um there's he's not just he's not
[5:48] praising the Believers just denouncing
[5:51] um the sin and the age he says but in
[5:53] this period there is evidently such
[5:55] wanton disregard for the Lord and his
[5:57] word that the entire message to this
[6:00] fifth age rings with condemnation
[6:03] if you look at verse 1 again he says I
[6:06] Know Thy Works thou has to name that
[6:08] they'll livest and are dead
[6:10] there's not a whole lot of roses to go
[6:12] with those Thorns Be watchful strengthen
[6:15] the things which remain that are ready
[6:17] to die
[6:18] this doesn't seem like this is a really
[6:20] successful age but this is how God is
[6:23] describing it and brother Brandon
[6:26] continues that the sardisian age was
[6:28] chaotic it was unfulfilled it was split
[6:32] scores of ways and God rebuked it almost
[6:35] in its entirety
[6:36] it was weak sickly ready to die it was
[6:40] not the Glorious era that carnal-minded
[6:43] Protestant historians have tried to make
[6:45] it be I was kind of shocked when I read
[6:48] this but the more you kind of meditate
[6:50] on it it's like wow this is this is true
[6:53] it was cankered blighted denuded of leaf
[6:56] and bearing of fruit except for some
[6:58] deformed and wormy fruit that was fast
[7:00] dropping
[7:02] to the ground
[7:03] so
[7:05] um to Evangelical Christians and to me
[7:07] as well the age of the Reformation
[7:09] seemed like an age of great victories
[7:11] for the faith and there were victories
[7:13] we won't underestimate those but we
[7:15] don't need to make them more than they
[7:16] were either
[7:17] was led by Mighty Men of God
[7:19] but Revelation 3 doesn't have a whole
[7:22] lot of positive to say about that and
[7:25] why is that
[7:27] I just want to talk about this evening
[7:28] and I have a my short answer if we're
[7:31] tired this evening read the short answer
[7:33] then you can take a nap every now on the
[7:35] service and you'll have the core of the
[7:37] of the message here but in the sardisian
[7:39] age God began the process of pulling the
[7:43] church out of the darkness and the areas
[7:45] they'd sunk into in the thyatiron age in
[7:47] the me and age this age of Sardis was an
[7:51] age of beginning but much was left
[7:53] uncompleted
[7:55] so the important lesson for us to take
[7:57] out of this is that we should never
[7:59] mistake a beginning work of God for his
[8:03] perfect plan
[8:04] this was a starting point
[8:07] but whenever God starts something it's
[8:09] easy to stop there and say look what
[8:11] Luther did and we'll stop right here
[8:13] but we never stop we just continue on
[8:16] and that is that is the mistake that was
[8:18] made it's a similar mistake that the
[8:20] Elders of Israel made as they looked
[8:23] what the amazing work that God did on
[8:25] Mount Sinai with with with Moses he's
[8:28] beginning his work of pulling the people
[8:31] out of Hedonism and teaching them how to
[8:34] please him that's what God was doing
[8:36] with the work of Moses but the Jewish
[8:38] rabbis stopped right there we're not
[8:40] going to go any further that was just
[8:42] the beginning point but as you see
[8:44] Christ was coming to fulfill it and
[8:46] showed them much more but they stopped
[8:48] there and that's a similar mistake that
[8:51] we can make we say look what God did in
[8:52] the Reformation we'll stop there but no
[8:54] it was just the beginning process more
[8:57] was still to come for those who would
[8:59] have ears to hear what the spirit would
[9:02] say in the future ages
[9:04] so we'll start first by noticing
[9:07] um
[9:09] God says I Know Thy works
[9:14] that's not usually the best way for a
[9:17] conversation between teacher and student
[9:19] to start when the Teacher Calls the
[9:21] student in Memphis I know what you've
[9:23] been up to I know your works because our
[9:27] works are generally not the best of
[9:29] things Galatians 5 19 says the works of
[9:32] the flesh the flesh has Works they're
[9:35] manifest which are these we'll just
[9:36] leave them as dot dot dot because the
[9:38] works of the flesh are bad
[9:40] God sees the works of the flesh and and
[9:44] it's and there's a lot of carnality in
[9:46] this age because it had been an age I
[9:48] mean this this church that God is
[9:50] speaking to in the 1516 early 1700s
[9:54] they've been they've known nothing but
[9:56] the carnality of the Catholic Church the
[9:58] carnality of men and it's hard to break
[10:01] away from that you've been focused on on
[10:03] men for so long even when God uses
[10:06] another man you'll tend to focus on him
[10:08] to your own detriment
[10:10] and it's hard to break that that habit
[10:12] The Works of the flesh were manifest we
[10:15] don't want God to know our work so much
[10:17] we want them to see the fruit of the
[10:19] spirit and that's he's seeing the works
[10:21] of their flesh you've seen the works of
[10:22] the flesh carnal Works manifest in this
[10:24] age but what's missing is the fruit of
[10:27] the spirit in the age
[10:29] because there's a lot of we could call
[10:32] it like inborn patterns that are just
[10:34] kind of keep going here what were these
[10:37] works that came up before the Lord and
[10:38] caused his displeasure well you know
[10:40] brother Branham says each age lapped
[10:42] over into the next stage so we have a
[10:44] continuation of the works of the fourth
[10:46] age going into the fifth some of this
[10:49] these learned behaviors as it were
[10:51] they're just continuing on what are
[10:53] these where the random lists them on
[10:55] page 281 of the church age book
[10:57] Holy Spirit leadership has been long ago
[11:00] in the pergaman age superseded by human
[11:02] hierarchy
[11:04] and that is that's that's a habit that's
[11:07] that's a behavior that really doesn't
[11:09] get put aside in the sardisian age
[11:13] you've got another hierarchy that gets
[11:15] set up to combat the old hierarchy but
[11:17] you don't you don't get under pure Holy
[11:20] Spirit leadership remember last time we
[11:22] talked about that woman Jezebel and how
[11:25] Jezebel married Ahab and taught him and
[11:28] the rest of Israel to sin and then they
[11:30] had a daughter athaliah who married into
[11:33] the more righteous Kingdom of Judah and
[11:36] she does the very same thing
[11:38] and that that's the pattern you see here
[11:40] Jezebel religion was in the Catholic
[11:43] Church
[11:44] and then what comes out of the Catholic
[11:46] Church there are these daughter churches
[11:48] that have these same kinds of habits
[11:51] that are that are that are teaching the
[11:54] people to uh to follow aside
[11:57] the pure word in its free benefits are
[12:00] displaced by Creeds and Dogma that
[12:02] happens gradually Luther certainly
[12:04] preaches justification by faith alone
[12:09] but gradually that you're going to have
[12:10] to be part of our church or by somebody
[12:12] or something else or something else gets
[12:14] added to that
[12:16] thirdly religion liturgy all these
[12:19] things replace
[12:20] spirits-filled worship the gifts of the
[12:23] Spirit this is how it was in pergamus
[12:25] thy attire and these things you're still
[12:27] kind of bleed over
[12:28] a work has definitely started but to say
[12:31] this is God's perfect restoration no
[12:33] it's not God still has more to come
[12:35] and Mary was uh
[12:38] she was elevated I think almost to a
[12:40] position of the godhead and the in the
[12:43] thyatiron age the pope of course so last
[12:45] time had taken the it was the vicar
[12:47] serving in the place of Christ and you
[12:51] don't want it to take place where where
[12:53] people are identifying more with the men
[12:55] of God than they are with God himself
[12:57] and that's that's one of these learned
[13:00] behaviors that's continuing into the age
[13:03] that the works are are are are still
[13:06] tripping them up as it were
[13:08] and like we've said at the beginning of
[13:11] each age God is revealing himself in a
[13:13] certain attribute that's really
[13:14] necessary to the age and in Revelation 3
[13:17] 1 he identifies himself these things
[13:19] saith he that hath the seven spirits of
[13:22] God and the Seven Stars so he's
[13:26] transporting us back to the vision of
[13:28] the seven candlesticks and the Seven
[13:30] Stars in Revelation chapter one well who
[13:33] has the seven spirits of God it's one
[13:34] God speaking he'll be speaking in
[13:36] different ways the Seven Stars are the
[13:38] Angels of the seven churches and even as
[13:41] it's it's the the Temptation is to be
[13:43] focusing so much on the star on on on
[13:46] the messenger that you can make an idol
[13:48] out of it
[13:49] but he's starting at the very beginning
[13:51] don't do that it's not the messenger
[13:53] it's it's it's it's it's the god who's
[13:56] holding the messenger in his hands don't
[13:58] don't lose sight of that and because
[14:01] that was that was the Achilles heel of
[14:04] this age they were God was God was you
[14:07] he was using so many different men to
[14:09] disturb revivals and then they would
[14:12] people would would fall into the same
[14:13] old patterns and they'd start looking at
[14:15] the man instead of the god that was
[14:18] using him and I would start killing the
[14:20] Revival right away
[14:21] and I just kind of I was writing today I
[14:24] thought
[14:25] a star is meant to guide us to the dark
[14:27] that we don't look at the star
[14:30] if you think about if you have a dark
[14:31] room and you have a flashlight you don't
[14:33] look at the flashlights beam that's
[14:35] going to Blind you you look at the light
[14:37] the flashlight casts and you walk in
[14:40] that light without being without just
[14:42] focusing on the beam if you look at the
[14:44] flashlight itself you're going to be
[14:46] blinded you're going to stumble and fall
[14:47] and that's what happens if you look just
[14:49] at the star and not follow the God who
[14:52] has the Seven Stars in his hand so
[14:54] that's why this introduction so
[14:56] important because he's speaking right to
[14:58] the weakness the Achilles heel of this
[15:00] age
[15:01] and successive ages and um in this age
[15:06] there was a dependency upon politics I
[15:10] mean if you've there's a there's a great
[15:12] film from the 1950s I think it is on
[15:14] Martin Luther and many many my might
[15:17] have seen it but it shows how uh he's
[15:20] just he's this little known Monk and uh
[15:23] I think in in Saxony he's he's a he had
[15:25] this college of Wittenberg and if it
[15:28] weren't for the protection of this Duke
[15:29] Frederick it seemed like Luther wouldn't
[15:31] have a chance he's so he the the the the
[15:34] political powers are helping protect
[15:37] um the the different reformers but you
[15:39] can you see quickly there's a dependence
[15:42] on politics and politics is getting
[15:44] mixed up there are a lot of folks in
[15:46] this religious Reformation they were
[15:48] just glad that through the politics of
[15:50] romoff and pay fewer taxes this is all
[15:53] intermeshed together
[15:55] remember the brand name says God raised
[15:57] up many Mighty Men of which Luther was
[15:59] but one Calvin as wingler were two other
[16:02] luminaries and beside these were many
[16:04] many more
[16:05] who are not so well known
[16:07] however though all this was not in vain
[16:09] the mighty work of God was actually
[16:12] hindered by these very men
[16:16] and one of the reasons is um they um
[16:20] they didn't oppose the church State
[16:22] marriage of the Nicene Council to
[16:24] actually Foster that Union there was a
[16:26] dependency sometimes upon politics upon
[16:28] becoming a new state Church
[16:33] um the defense of the Gospel by the
[16:35] state was welcomed
[16:37] even though there was no word for it and
[16:40] then if you I I haven't I left out the
[16:43] next part of it and brother Brown says
[16:45] we can see the wrath of man praising God
[16:47] in such events as King Henry VII of
[16:50] England taking up the Reformation
[16:51] rejecting papal Authority now when King
[16:55] Charles took the the crown under the
[16:58] thing one of the titles he took on
[17:00] himself was the defender of the faith
[17:02] which he before is that he wouldn't take
[17:04] that title because he didn't believe in
[17:06] a faith or the faith but it's ironic
[17:09] that how did the king of England get
[17:10] this title defender of the faith the
[17:12] pope gave it to him
[17:14] because Henry VIII wrote this big tract
[17:17] against Luther and the pope was so
[17:19] impressed Pope Leo the tenth hey I'm
[17:22] making King Henry VII the defender of
[17:24] the faith now until they went to King
[17:27] Henry's head and say I can ask the pope
[17:29] to kind of help me arrange my marriage
[17:30] situation get a divorce and the pope
[17:32] said no so then the English church broke
[17:36] away not for any revelation of the from
[17:39] the word of God is because the king
[17:40] wanted the divorce this is the wrath of
[17:43] man actually praises the righteousness
[17:45] of God it was no repentance by the king
[17:48] but this this carnal step God uses a lot
[17:52] of I mean Bible translations came out of
[17:54] the king the King James version comes
[17:56] out of it in later years William Tyndale
[17:58] writes his uh translates his Bible there
[18:01] are a lot of things coming out of this
[18:02] that wasn't all because of spiritual
[18:04] religious
[18:05] or reasons
[18:08] um
[18:09] in spite of Luther's constant teaching
[18:13] against outside interference in local
[18:15] church matters he was not able to clear
[18:17] men's minds of the bishop Archbishop
[18:19] concept of church government it was a
[18:21] beginning
[18:22] but it wasn't the complete work
[18:24] thus the church took one step in the
[18:27] right direction but still remained
[18:29] Shackled so in short order she was again
[18:31] imprisoned in the same dejin whence she
[18:35] had attempted to escape
[18:38] so it was um it's not the the Glorious
[18:41] story it can be made out to be it was a
[18:44] it was a beginning point that God was
[18:46] was working with them on
[18:49] and the and um Revelation 3 1 God that
[18:52] describes after he says I know your
[18:54] Works he says you have a name that you
[18:56] live and are dead if you kind of think
[18:59] about this as this is a this is a
[19:01] paradox it's like the combination of two
[19:04] things that you wouldn't really expect
[19:06] to be together how can this be and it's
[19:08] kind of one of these intriguing
[19:09] statements that help makes you Plumb and
[19:12] think about what's what's going on well
[19:15] if you take the name of Christ you're
[19:18] going to be alive because acts 4 12 says
[19:21] there's salvation there's there's
[19:22] salvation no other name there's no other
[19:25] name under Heaven among men or by you
[19:27] must be saved so if you've got Christ's
[19:29] name you're certainly going to be alive
[19:32] there's one God one mediator between God
[19:34] and men if you've got if you're if
[19:36] you're in contact with Jesus you're
[19:38] gonna be in contact with God because
[19:40] that's the way to God
[19:42] so if they've got the name that they
[19:44] that they're living
[19:46] but they're dead they don't have
[19:47] Christ's name but if they had Christ and
[19:49] they'd be living and they would be fully
[19:50] alive so there's there's a different
[19:52] name
[19:54] and we could say people were getting
[19:56] tied to their leaders instead of to
[19:59] Christ
[20:00] and they made their own names great
[20:04] instead of making God's name great and
[20:07] that continues to be an Achilles heel up
[20:10] to today that we don't want to be tied
[20:13] to our leader we want to be tied to to
[20:15] to to to the Lord himself there's no you
[20:19] can have the the greatest Pastor in the
[20:21] world but he is no replacement for Jesus
[20:24] Christ and we get in trouble when we
[20:26] when we we want to appreciate and evalue
[20:29] the gifts God gives us
[20:31] but remember
[20:33] they're just stars in God's hand
[20:38] you know when we talk about a name that
[20:40] they'll livest and they're dead this
[20:42] concept is repeated somewhere else in
[20:43] Revelation we remember last time we
[20:46] talked about the the Beast that that
[20:48] woman Jezebel was riding in Revelation
[20:50] chapter 17. and John is carried away in
[20:53] the spirit to look at this beast and he
[20:55] sees a woman sitting Upon A Scarlet
[20:57] colored Beast full of Dames of blasphemy
[21:01] having seven heads and ten horns
[21:04] names of blasphemy are going to be
[21:06] another way of saying you have a name
[21:08] that you're living yet you're dead these
[21:12] two ideas are going to be similar
[21:14] and what it is
[21:16] um you're taking a name like a church
[21:20] name or a human Leader's name and you're
[21:22] identifying with that and that's not
[21:26] going to give you a new birth give you a
[21:28] new life and when you're actually saying
[21:30] hey I'm and you're you're saying I'm I'm
[21:33] following Christ
[21:35] under some other name and you're living
[21:37] wherever you want you're actually
[21:38] blaspheming Christ's name because you're
[21:41] living a different life than the life
[21:43] that he would give
[21:45] then the message all things this is in
[21:48] the bottom of page two
[21:51] um brother Graham talks about this
[21:54] God wants to perform his word by his
[21:57] power and when the church denies his
[21:59] power how can he perform and vindicate
[22:01] his word when the church explains the
[22:04] way and says it's for some other day and
[22:06] something how can God who wants to
[22:08] fulfill this word and performance word
[22:09] among the people when the people are
[22:11] denying that he even does it
[22:13] yes they go through all the rituals see
[22:15] but he says here's what happened God
[22:18] wants to perform by the Holy Ghost and
[22:20] vindicate his word
[22:22] and the church wants to perform
[22:25] I thought that was really neatly neatly
[22:27] phrased God wants to perform his word
[22:29] Vindicated but the church just wants to
[22:31] give me the stage give me a mic let me
[22:34] sing I will perform and I want to be I
[22:37] want people to be looking to me be I
[22:40] want to attracting to me just let me
[22:42] perform
[22:43] and that still happens that God wants to
[22:45] perform this word but the church just
[22:47] wants to perform
[22:48] and then they they bask in the phrase
[22:51] after their performance but that is not
[22:53] Christianity Christianity is when God
[22:56] performs his word in US vindicating his
[22:59] promises but the church just wants to
[23:02] perform they have to deny the Holy Ghost
[23:04] they want to perform to make a big
[23:07] organization what else to bring
[23:08] membership no matter what you have to
[23:11] baptize Sinners drunkards Bootleggers
[23:13] anything else and take them into the
[23:15] body of the church
[23:17] no wonder Revelation 17 said this old
[23:21] prostitute woman that had a bunch of
[23:23] daughters that she was full of names or
[23:25] Blasphemous names people who join
[23:27] churches and call that got salvation
[23:30] it's a blasphemy that cheapens salvation
[23:34] it's kind of like uh
[23:36] um people look look at church membership
[23:39] like gym membership
[23:41] you pay your dues and but you never have
[23:45] to go
[23:46] you just I'm a member of the local YMCA
[23:49] I I go every now and then so I can talk
[23:53] the talk of being sore and that kind of
[23:55] thing but it hasn't really changed my
[23:57] life I'm a card caring member of the
[23:59] YMCA but I can eat what I want I do what
[24:02] I want and I'm still I've got my gym
[24:04] pass
[24:05] that's how people look at hey I'm saved
[24:08] because I got my name in the book I'm a
[24:10] part I can fellowship with people like
[24:12] that but God wants to change us he wants
[24:15] to transform us that's what it's about
[24:18] people who join churches and call that
[24:19] got salvation it's a blasphemy it
[24:22] cheapens what God actually is doing
[24:23] she's got 900 something different
[24:25] organizations in there plenty of
[24:27] Blasphemous names I guess I'm a
[24:29] Christian I'm a I'm the Lutheran version
[24:31] I'm the I'm the Wesleyan version I'm
[24:34] this version the Pentecostal version I
[24:36] think brother Brandon would probably say
[24:37] today this or that message Camp version
[24:39] but we don't want any other name than
[24:42] his name we don't want to be focusing on
[24:44] anybody else that will make God has no
[24:46] big preachers little preachers they're
[24:48] all stars in his hands but we don't look
[24:50] at the star we look at the one who's
[24:51] holding them that's that's what we're
[24:53] getting to so they got away by some
[24:55] man-made tradition they got away from
[24:58] the true worship
[25:00] and that is how we get to a Blasphemous
[25:03] name where we're and brother Branham
[25:06] talks about it in different messages
[25:07] there's actually a sermon called
[25:08] Blasphemous names
[25:10] um another might happen in the notes is
[25:12] from return in Jubilee
[25:13] and um
[25:15] brother Brandon's speaking again from
[25:17] Revelation chapter 17 he says the King
[25:19] James puts it she had names of blasphemy
[25:22] and uh
[25:24] it says that means to me I don't know if
[25:26] I'm wrong but God forgive me it means
[25:28] churches took on the names of
[25:29] Christianity yet live like the world act
[25:33] like the world through the things of the
[25:35] world has brought a disgrace upon the
[25:37] True Church of the Living God and they
[25:40] join those it says you might join the
[25:42] Methodist Lodge Presbyterian Lodge
[25:44] Pentecostal Lodge but you can't join the
[25:46] church you have to be born into the
[25:48] church by the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[25:51] and that's uh that's a supernatural um
[25:54] Supernatural event in one's life
[25:58] and The Only Name that a Christian can
[26:00] take on is Jesus Christ we can't take on
[26:03] any other name we try to take on any
[26:05] other name we're taking a name that we
[26:08] live but we're dead because no other
[26:10] power is able to transform us from the
[26:12] inside out and sustain us all through
[26:15] life's journey
[26:17] and then there's a there's a there's a
[26:19] principle that uh that brother Brandon
[26:21] makes clear throughout the message that
[26:24] we we take on Jesus Christ's name but
[26:26] also it's only in his name that God will
[26:30] meet man
[26:31] God has and he has a a message he
[26:34] preaches in 1965 in Jeffersonville God's
[26:37] only provided place of worship where he
[26:40] explains he might preach it a few
[26:41] different places but the principle is
[26:43] God meets us where he wants to meet us
[26:47] it's not us to decide where we want to
[26:49] worship God or how we want to worship
[26:50] God God tells us you want to meet me
[26:52] here's where you meet me and um
[26:55] Deuteronomy 16 establishes pretty
[26:58] concisely Thou shalt therefore sacrifice
[27:00] the Passover unto the Lord thy God of
[27:02] the flock and the herd in the place
[27:04] which the Lord shall choose to place his
[27:07] name there
[27:08] you couldn't sacrifice anywhere you
[27:11] couldn't sacrifice in your backyard you
[27:13] couldn't sacrifice you could find this
[27:15] beautiful this beautiful over Scenic
[27:17] overlooked this would be I I could if I
[27:20] could just sacrifice here this is
[27:22] beautiful I always feel so close to God
[27:24] here in nature why can I sacrifice here
[27:26] no you couldn't the heathens could build
[27:28] they they'd have Groves and altars
[27:30] wherever they wanted to but God says no
[27:32] you worship me in one place in one place
[27:36] only that's where I've placed my name
[27:37] nowhere else it was a big deal to God
[27:40] let me go a couple chapters before in
[27:43] Deuteronomy 14
[27:45] um God said Moses was writing you will
[27:47] truly tithe all the increase of your
[27:49] seed that the field bringeth forth year
[27:52] by year
[27:53] and thou shalt eat before the Lord thy
[27:56] God in the place which he shall choose
[27:59] to place his name there this is the
[28:02] tithe of your corn the wine your oil the
[28:04] first things of your herds and flocks
[28:07] that you may learn to fear the lord thy
[28:09] God always
[28:11] but he recognizes what if you live
[28:14] a hundred miles from the Tabernacle it's
[28:17] a big deal to take all of your flocks
[28:19] and herds there God says that's fine
[28:22] turn those things into money
[28:25] sell you sell what you want to sacrifice
[28:26] sell them take the money then once you
[28:29] get to the place where God's chosen to
[28:31] place his name you can buy something to
[28:33] sacrifice there and you can make the
[28:35] sacrifice there so he's saying it's
[28:38] really important to me that you come the
[28:40] place where I ask you to come and if
[28:42] it's inconvenient for you here's
[28:43] something you can do turn your crops
[28:46] turn your whatever you want to offer
[28:47] into money come buy whatever you want to
[28:50] offer do it there the important place is
[28:52] you come or I ask you to come
[28:54] and you know what we can say why does
[28:56] God have to be so picky we could all say
[28:58] hey if you love God especially you say
[29:00] you love God
[29:01] why not just worship Him worry ask you
[29:03] to worship Him and how he asks you to
[29:05] worship him because he's God after all
[29:08] he's the one who has he's the one who
[29:10] puts it on us to do something and not
[29:13] the other way around
[29:15] we sacrifice to God where he chooses to
[29:19] place his name and it's the importance
[29:21] of offering those sacrifices in the
[29:24] right place
[29:26] and it is in this in this scripture
[29:28] where you got those three verses and
[29:30] each of these three verses from 23-25 in
[29:33] the place that God shall choose to place
[29:35] his name every verse is there it's
[29:37] emphasized we want to worship God where
[29:40] he is
[29:43] so we can try to be worshiping God in
[29:45] the place where he's not
[29:48] that's not how God wants us to worship
[29:49] him where is God moving in our lives
[29:52] what what channel is he is he using to
[29:55] move there that's where we want to be in
[29:56] worship
[29:58] um for him
[29:59] brother bran talks about this principle
[30:01] in this message God's chosen place of
[30:03] worship he does now notice not one word
[30:06] of the Shadows fail and he's preaching
[30:07] from this these these texts in
[30:09] Deuteronomy these are types and shadows
[30:12] of the Old Testament why was that so
[30:14] important brother Graham's going to
[30:15] explain that now not one word of the
[30:17] Shadows fail he's both Christ is both
[30:20] the word of God and the name of God he
[30:23] was the word made flesh he was the word
[30:25] of God the Lamb of God the name of God
[30:27] he was God that's what he was the Chosen
[30:30] and only place of worship to God
[30:34] and God refuses any other place besides
[30:37] in Jesus Christ you cannot worship him
[30:40] anywhere so the scribes and Pharisees
[30:42] they had an elaborous system
[30:45] that they said Moses set this up we're
[30:47] worshiping where God wants us to worship
[30:50] but the place of worship at that time
[30:53] was not the temple anymore the place of
[30:55] worship was in Jesus Christ he was the
[30:59] word made flesh all those sacrifices
[31:01] could have been offered there even on
[31:04] the day of Pentecost
[31:05] there was a there was sacrifice they
[31:08] were supposed to be offered on the day
[31:09] of Pentecost I just like to to dramatize
[31:12] it for myself there are 120 people in an
[31:15] upper room
[31:16] and they're worshiping and praying that
[31:19] morning in Jerusalem at the very same
[31:22] time that the priest is leading this
[31:25] calf out this Bullock out and he's
[31:29] laying this block on the Altar and he's
[31:31] he's he's slicing its throat and killing
[31:34] it which sacrifice is God accepting
[31:38] though no fire comes down no Spirits
[31:41] Falls as this priest is offering this
[31:44] this this Bullock the sacrifice that God
[31:46] was wanting was a broken and contrite
[31:48] spirit up in that upper room they were
[31:51] doing exactly a Christ they said that's
[31:53] where the fire fell because that's where
[31:55] Jesus Christ was they were worshiping
[31:57] where God had placed his name
[32:00] and the same way today I mean there can
[32:02] be all kinds of places today where they
[32:06] where people can be proclaiming we're
[32:07] worshiping God but like I I've showed in
[32:11] previous sermons I mean
[32:13] these are denominational leaders who are
[32:15] also saying people are worshiping in
[32:17] churches they're basically worshiping
[32:19] their version of the American dream with
[32:21] the name of Christ in front of it
[32:23] they're really just worshiping
[32:24] themselves they like this middle class
[32:27] life where they can feel good about
[32:28] doing whatever they want to do and
[32:31] that's basically the doctrine of Balaam
[32:33] but not Balaam was really good at making
[32:35] people feel good about doing what they
[32:38] wanted to do
[32:39] they could lift whatever they wanted and
[32:41] bail them said you'll be fine
[32:43] and that's the kind of doctrine that is
[32:45] writ large today and that's the name of
[32:48] blasphemy we're we're saying we're
[32:50] worshiping God when we're doing
[32:51] everything how we want to do it and
[32:54] we're really just worshiping
[32:56] the one who's in the in the temple of
[32:58] God setting himself up as he is God
[33:00] that's the Antichrist
[33:02] there's only one place to worship God
[33:04] and that's as we're following revealed
[33:07] scripture we have to continue saying
[33:08] what the spirit set into the churches we
[33:10] want to have an ear to that and not stop
[33:12] us he continues speaking when they keep
[33:14] on listening and following that whole
[33:17] way
[33:25] and on page four
[33:28] from that same message God's chosen
[33:31] place of worship
[33:36] God refuses any other place besides in
[33:39] Jesus Christ you cannot worship him
[33:41] anywhere
[33:43] Jesus said I'm the way the truth and the
[33:45] life no man can come to God except by me
[33:47] I am the door to the Sheepfold all
[33:49] without our thieves he is the only
[33:51] approach he is the door the way the
[33:54] truth life all the theory is everything
[33:56] is tied to Jesus Christ the Old
[33:58] Testament is tied to him the New
[34:00] Testament is tied to him the church
[34:02] today is tied to him by the word of his
[34:04] commandment there is not another place
[34:06] or another name or anywhere where God
[34:09] ever promised to me to man only in Jesus
[34:12] Christ his chosen place of worship
[34:15] he was the word made flesh and God is
[34:18] still a God who wants to be tangible to
[34:20] us he still made flesh today and that is
[34:25] it's very easy to look back and say ah
[34:27] Jesus Christ died on the cross that was
[34:29] the word made flesh but he is still a
[34:31] God who wants to be made flesh in our
[34:34] lives today and and the Crux of the
[34:36] matter is will we follow God as he's
[34:37] made flesh today
[34:39] it is made flesh today
[34:42] now in the um in the 17th century there
[34:45] was a leader of a uh of a movement
[34:47] called the Czech Brethren and his name
[34:50] was Jan
[34:52] um Amos comenius and uh
[34:56] I I came across his name last year as I
[34:58] was reading the church age book I'd
[34:59] never heard of him before um brother
[35:01] Brennan
[35:02] um
[35:03] quote from him at length before comenius
[35:06] died he wrote a a pamphlet called one
[35:09] thing needful you can actually find it I
[35:11] have a link on the on and and the notes
[35:15] and he dies 1670 so if he's writing this
[35:18] is the last thing that he writes I mean
[35:21] Luther writes his 95 Theses in 1517. so
[35:24] he's he's living in the middle of the
[35:26] reformation and he's able then to kind
[35:29] of see what's what's what have been the
[35:31] fruits of this
[35:33] and brother Brandon like I said he
[35:34] quotes him at length and I want to kind
[35:37] of highlight some of the things that
[35:38] comenius says
[35:40] um he was um
[35:43] he he was associated with the Moravian
[35:46] Church which is uh actually a group of
[35:49] Believers that was doing missionary work
[35:52] also in the in the 13 colonies John
[35:55] Wesley and Charles West were doing
[35:56] missionary work in in Georgia which was
[35:58] a penal colony at the time in his West
[36:00] so it comes back across the United
[36:02] across the Atlantic going back to
[36:04] England the the ships going through this
[36:07] terrible storm in the west he does not
[36:08] have Assurance of his salvation he's
[36:11] Amazed by these Christians here on the
[36:13] ship who were praying seeing Psalms and
[36:15] they had peace and these people were
[36:17] moravians
[36:19] so this is a a link with uh comenius but
[36:23] communist writes this tract one thing
[36:25] needful
[36:26] and he surveys the the what have been
[36:28] the fruits of the Reformation he says
[36:29] the great number of teachers
[36:31] is the reason of the multitudes of sects
[36:34] for which we shall soon have no names
[36:36] left
[36:37] each Church reckons itself as the true
[36:40] one or at least as the purest truest
[36:42] part of it all among themselves they
[36:44] persecute each other with the bitterest
[36:46] hatred
[36:48] out of the Bible they Forge their
[36:50] different Creeds and these are their
[36:52] fortresses and bull works by which they
[36:54] entrench themselves and resist all
[36:56] attacks
[36:57] so you can see you're and we have to
[37:00] watch out ourselves and if we're study
[37:01] in the Bible say oh yeah this is the
[37:03] verse I'll use that against that brother
[37:05] this is the verse that's the answer the
[37:08] answer that'll put her in their place
[37:09] this is the verse that shows I'm right
[37:11] that's the wrong way to approach the
[37:14] word the word of God is never a fortress
[37:16] or bulwark for ourselves that's a great
[37:18] misuse of the word of God when we
[37:21] approach God through his Lord help me to
[37:23] be more Godly
[37:25] that's that's that's what we should
[37:27] always approach the word but you see
[37:29] this is a very he's looking at the
[37:32] Reformation from within the Reformation
[37:34] they say this is a bunch of carnality
[37:39] he says to this Labyrinth of sex and
[37:42] various confessions another belongs the
[37:46] love of disputation
[37:49] what is attained by it
[37:52] has a single learned Strife ever been
[37:55] settled never their number has only been
[38:00] increased
[38:01] and you can think about that sometimes
[38:03] folks when you've got
[38:05] doing these long scripture studies or
[38:07] quote studies and nobody in the message
[38:10] has studied this but how many angels can
[38:12] dance on the tip of a pen right the and
[38:14] he tried he tried to he tried to make
[38:16] you make mountains of bull Hills
[38:18] and how many times has that gone on I
[38:21] think this is the document determined
[38:22] whether somebody's in or out
[38:24] and this this is this is the question
[38:25] people always go back to that's not how
[38:28] we approach the word it's and when we
[38:31] and I was doing some meditation recently
[38:34] on on questions because you know we
[38:37] we've heard that teachers tell us
[38:39] there's there's no stupid questions
[38:41] right so people if you've got a question
[38:43] ask a question because there's no such
[38:44] thing as a stupid question
[38:47] I was reading though recently and um
[38:49] Paul does say something that's
[38:52] not quite Kosher for teachers today
[38:56] he says in the second Timothy 2 verse 23
[39:00] says but foolish and non-learned
[39:03] questions avoid
[39:06] so that we might not say there's any
[39:07] stupid questions but Paul says there are
[39:10] foolish questions
[39:12] and what is the attributes of a foolish
[39:14] question it says foolish unloaded
[39:17] questions avoid knowing that they do
[39:19] gender strifes
[39:21] so if the fruit of the question is just
[39:23] more and more Strife arguing back and
[39:25] forth
[39:27] I'd avoid that question drop it because
[39:29] that's a that's a foolish question
[39:32] verse 24 the servant of the Lord must
[39:35] not strive but be gentle unto all men
[39:38] apt to teach patience
[39:41] in meekness instructing those that
[39:44] oppose themselves
[39:46] if God pair Adventure will give them
[39:48] repentance to the acknowledging of the
[39:50] truth and that they may recover
[39:51] themselves out of the snare of the devil
[39:54] what was the snare of the devil the
[39:56] snare of the devil was this foolish
[39:58] question
[40:00] I think yeah just a question I'm going
[40:02] to go to I'm going to take a look at it
[40:03] spend some time on it be careful if it's
[40:04] a foolish question it's a snare of the
[40:06] devil a Godly question is one a good
[40:09] question is one that will lead you to
[40:11] Godliness
[40:12] but there's that that that that is it's
[40:15] a question that they can establish us
[40:17] firmer in the faith that'll that'll
[40:19] that'll help us know better how we can
[40:21] be more Godly but the foolish question
[40:22] is it's going to Puff us up with with
[40:24] pride with some arrogance that we know
[40:27] it better somebody else is is is
[40:29] different avoid those kinds of questions
[40:30] because those are not of God and those
[40:33] foolish questions become a snare of the
[40:35] devil
[40:36] and if you look back how did the fall
[40:38] start
[40:39] it started with a foolish question
[40:44] did God really say
[40:46] you should not eat the tree did God
[40:50] really say that
[40:51] the devil asked this question what was
[40:54] his motive that his motive was not to
[40:56] find out what did God say he didn't care
[40:57] what God said he knew what God Said that
[40:59] wasn't his motive
[41:01] so if that if a question is sometimes a
[41:04] nice mask to hide back some some subtle
[41:08] motive because Eve she didn't have the
[41:10] discernment to know this was a foolish
[41:12] question she deals with it she listens
[41:15] to it she handles it in the four too
[41:17] long if she finds that she's ensnared by
[41:20] this question
[41:21] so it's good to have discernment what
[41:23] why didn't you go to Adam with the
[41:25] question
[41:26] because a foolish question is one that
[41:28] you kind of just mull on mull on mull on
[41:30] yourself and it's taking
[41:32] she probably Googled the question she
[41:35] probably did all kinds of things with
[41:36] the question but she didn't go to God
[41:38] with the question
[41:39] because a foolish question is going to
[41:41] keep you right it's going to do
[41:43] everything it can to keep you from keep
[41:45] you from God himself and how many times
[41:47] is that foolish questions keep us away
[41:50] from our Bibles
[41:51] take us to every single Source except
[41:54] our Bible
[41:55] because the spirit behind the question
[41:57] is a spirit to ensnare us and not to
[42:01] draw us closer to God
[42:03] and convenience is saying to this
[42:05] Labyrinth of sex and various confessions
[42:08] belong something else a love of
[42:10] disputation this love of disputation is
[42:12] going to be chopping up this this body
[42:15] of Christ and all these different
[42:16] branches and everything like this a
[42:17] labyrinth is a maze
[42:19] and look at this and it's it's a
[42:22] confusing mess
[42:25] but he says Satan is the greatest
[42:27] sophist uh someone who argues plays with
[42:30] words and Satan has never been overcome
[42:33] in The Strife of words
[42:35] never so we don't fight Satan with
[42:38] argument we fight him with prayer we
[42:41] fight him with the word but you're not
[42:42] going to out argue Satan
[42:45] and this is a one that I didn't have
[42:48] space in all the slides to include this
[42:50] but in Divine service communities
[42:52] criticism of the Reformation movement
[42:54] this it says in Divine service the words
[42:57] of men are usually heard more than the
[43:00] word of God
[43:01] and our foolish questions how often is
[43:04] the word of God really what's being
[43:06] exalted
[43:07] or something else each one Chatters as
[43:09] he pleases or kills time I learned
[43:12] disquisitions in disproving the views of
[43:15] others but of the new birth and how a
[43:17] man must be changed into the likeness of
[43:19] Christ to become partakers of the divine
[43:22] nature scarcely anything is said
[43:26] of the power of the keys the church has
[43:28] almost lost the power of binding only
[43:30] the power of loosening Remains the
[43:32] sacraments given as symbols of unity of
[43:34] love and our life and Christ happened
[43:36] made the occasion of bitterest conflict
[43:39] a cause of mutual hatred a center of
[43:42] sectarianism
[43:43] in short Christendom has become a
[43:47] labyrinth
[43:48] the faith has been split into a thousand
[43:51] little parts
[43:52] and you're made a heretic if there's one
[43:55] of those little parts that you do not
[43:57] accept you don't believe my Revelation
[43:59] on this little thing we can't have
[44:01] Fellowship but believe this
[44:04] we're we're missing we're missing the
[44:06] main thing then
[44:11] what can help
[44:13] only the one thing needs for return to
[44:16] Christ looking to Christ as the only
[44:19] leader walking in his footsteps setting
[44:22] us aside all other ways until we all
[44:24] reach the goal and have come to the
[44:27] unity of the faith
[44:30] amen he says so now Noah still
[44:33] Christendom
[44:35] sorry um as the Heavenly Master Built
[44:38] everything on the ground of the
[44:39] scriptures so should we leave all
[44:40] particularities of our special
[44:42] confessions and be satisfied with the
[44:44] revealed word of God which belongs to us
[44:46] all
[44:47] with the Bible in our hand communist
[44:49] rights we should cry I believe what God
[44:51] has revealed in this book I will
[44:53] obediently keep his commands I hope that
[44:55] which he has promised Christians give
[44:57] ear there is only one life but death
[45:00] comes to us in a thousand forms there is
[45:02] only one Christ but a thousand
[45:05] antichrists
[45:07] the one thing needs for return to Christ
[45:10] I just thought he just and he just
[45:12] phrases this does it expresses it so so
[45:15] well
[45:17] um
[45:17] and there just like in the early Church
[45:20] in the book of uh First Corinthians we
[45:22] have to beware this uh mentality I'm of
[45:25] Paul I'm of Apollos I'm of cephas that's
[45:28] how the faith gets split up into all
[45:30] these little little fiefdoms it was that
[45:32] way in Corinthians it was that way in
[45:34] the Reformation it can be that way it's
[45:36] still today beware
[45:39] brother Branham continues to say in page
[45:42] 284 and 85 of the church age book he
[45:45] says uh this era gave tremendous growth
[45:48] to the denominational Spirit if the
[45:51] Corinthian attitude of I am of Paul I
[45:53] have Stevens was ever exhibited it was
[45:55] now there were lutherans hussites
[45:57] zwingliites
[45:59] Etc such fragmentation of the body was
[46:01] deplorable they were living a name but
[46:04] were dead certainly they were dead they
[46:06] died the minute they organized the great
[46:09] groups organized and tied themselves in
[46:11] matchmented the state that did it they
[46:14] were finished
[46:16] then it goes on and says they're living
[46:18] their own name talking about
[46:20] denominations even today they're living
[46:22] their own name and not the name of the
[46:24] Lord Jesus Christ is that's easily seen
[46:26] for every church is known by the way it
[46:28] worships but never known by the power of
[46:30] God
[46:31] what is it that we that identifies
[46:33] churches the way they worship
[46:36] but that's really not how one should
[46:38] identify us it should be God's power
[46:40] moving within us because we can make
[46:43] the the the things that we use to
[46:46] characterize one another can be such
[46:48] minor things
[46:50] and we can miss miss the main thing if
[46:53] we focus on the on those little things
[46:59] and then one of brother Graham's final
[47:01] comments on this age
[47:03] actually I'm not missing one here oops
[47:08] he says I cannot press upon you too
[47:10] strongly that this age though it brought
[47:13] the Reformation was most sternly rebuked
[47:16] by God instead of being praised because
[47:18] it's sowed the seed of denomination that
[47:21] organized right back to the Harlot and
[47:23] that's the pro that's the pattern we saw
[47:25] in the Old Testament last a couple weeks
[47:26] ago Jezebel with an athalaya going over
[47:29] into Judah teaching idolatry to the
[47:32] kingdom of Judah and the kingdom starts
[47:34] going on downhill after that
[47:36] when the move away from the Catholic
[47:38] Church took place it was not truly
[47:40] spiritual as a whole but was more
[47:41] political
[47:43] and most of the people took up with
[47:44] protestantism because they hated the
[47:46] Roman system of political and financial
[47:48] bondage
[47:49] thus instead of this being a great
[47:51] spiritual move with all the earmarks of
[47:53] Holy Spirit influence is when God used
[47:55] purely spiritual means to accomplish his
[47:58] ends at Pentecost it was indeed a work
[48:00] where in the wrath of man praised God
[48:03] so here you see people were doing their
[48:05] own thing it was permissive will of God
[48:07] but it was still God's purpose to
[48:09] accomplish his work so yes King Henry
[48:11] VII he got his wives but even his
[48:14] carnality would not prevent God from
[48:16] starting his work and and God did indeed
[48:19] begin it and then the jezebelie brother
[48:22] Graham says the Jezebel Lafayette tire
[48:23] was in no mood to give up her hold upon
[48:26] the people and thus we see her daughter
[48:28] athaliah raise her head in the sardisian
[48:30] age with the hopes that she would be
[48:31] able to strangle the true seed by her
[48:34] schemes of organization
[48:37] so the the key Point here is that we
[48:41] should never mistake the beginning of
[48:43] God's work for his completed work so on
[48:46] Mount Sinai with the law God met the
[48:49] people of Israel where they were
[48:52] he met him where they were and if you
[48:54] look at the laws that they that God that
[48:57] he had to talk about he didn't talk
[48:59] about all kinds of strange relationships
[49:03] even bestiality is mentioned there on
[49:05] the law well why because these people
[49:07] were coming out of pagans if they they
[49:08] needed taught about everything
[49:11] he met them where they were
[49:13] but he's gradually bringing them
[49:15] bringing them bringing until he himself
[49:16] becomes made flesh to take them further
[49:19] and that's what they they said no no no
[49:21] we're going to stay right where you
[49:22] started but the beginning work of God is
[49:25] never the perfect work of God
[49:27] yet because the church leaders the
[49:30] rabbis mistook the first work of God the
[49:32] laws has completed in perfect work they
[49:35] missed God's ultimate goal for them
[49:38] the Holy Spirit God's spirit in them and
[49:41] similarly brother Branham calls the
[49:43] sardisian age the Reformation age an
[49:45] unfulfilled age it was the starting
[49:47] point but it was far from being the
[49:50] complete restoration itself the complete
[49:53] restoration was still to come for those
[49:55] who would have ears to hear what the
[49:57] spirit says to the church is we have to
[49:58] continue to follow God as he reveals
[50:01] himself further
[50:02] so in Revelation 3 2
[50:06] John writes be a watchful strength in
[50:08] the things which remain that are ready
[50:10] to die for I have not found my works
[50:13] perfect before God
[50:16] where the Bram says do you know what the
[50:18] meaning of not perfect really is it's
[50:20] unfulfilled
[50:21] this age was an unfulfilled age it was
[50:24] just the start of getting back
[50:27] it had started out in the doctrine of
[50:29] salvation which meant salvation was all
[50:31] of God and oh how Luther preached the
[50:33] sovereignty of God and election he knew
[50:36] it was all of Grace he separated the
[50:38] church from rule by ecclesiastical
[50:40] hierarchy he tore down the idols he cast
[50:43] out the compassion of the priest he
[50:44] denounced the pope it was wonderfully
[50:46] good as he started but God had said 1500
[50:49] years before to John on the Isle of
[50:51] Patmos Luther you're going to start
[50:53] things but your age will see it all
[50:55] unfulfilled I'm leaving that to later
[50:59] and the devil couldn't stop Luther
[51:01] but the devil does try to stop is to get
[51:03] us from going further than Luther he
[51:06] wants to keep us at this unfulfilled
[51:08] part
[51:10] this was an unfulfilled age an age of
[51:13] reformation but that's how God wanted it
[51:16] and every age is asked basically to do
[51:19] the same thing will you follow what
[51:20] God's doing now
[51:23] and that's the test
[51:25] so it was started then but he's
[51:26] continuing even up to now will we follow
[51:29] what God is revealing now
[51:33] and I just say a really great place to
[51:36] start is if we believe truly
[51:40] that Malachi 4 talks about Elijah the
[51:43] prophet coming before the great and
[51:45] Dreadful day of the Lord if we if we
[51:46] believe that
[51:48] will we crack open the book sometime
[51:51] and read it
[51:53] young folk young people we're out of
[51:55] school now and we can say but all
[51:57] sincerity during the school year I just
[52:00] don't have time
[52:02] we can't say that tomorrow morning
[52:04] we don't have to go to school tomorrow
[52:05] morning we don't have homework tomorrow
[52:07] morning
[52:08] I just encourage you crack open a book
[52:11] because if we really say God has done
[52:14] this
[52:17] let Brethren let us not
[52:19] take a more Earnest heed
[52:21] don't forget the things we've heard
[52:23] unless we should let them slip take time
[52:25] put Roots down into what God has done
[52:28] today
[52:29] Jesus says if you continue in my word
[52:34] then you're my disciples indeed
[52:36] so if someone starts has an experience
[52:39] with God at some Revival in the street
[52:41] corner in some church there's nothing
[52:43] about the message but God starts to work
[52:45] there great God can start a work
[52:48] anywhere we can't be to say that God the
[52:51] only me God can only starts thinking
[52:52] here no God's gonna start anywhere
[52:55] but this truth continues to be revealed
[52:57] and unfolded hey walk into it walk into
[53:01] it if you continue in my word then are
[53:03] you my disciples indeed and then you
[53:06] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[53:09] make you free so don't make the mistake
[53:13] brother Brandon
[53:14] um it sounds like in the church age book
[53:16] it sounds like in Revelation chapter 3
[53:18] that this period of reformation is being
[53:20] just push the size like no but you know
[53:24] what it is we also still today people
[53:27] are looking at the Seven Stars in Christ
[53:29] ten and all they see are the is is is
[53:31] the star
[53:32] and they can be if you just look at the
[53:34] light you'll be blinded but walk in that
[53:36] light and then you'll continue to go
[53:38] further on to whatever light God has
[53:40] further for us there is more so I'd say
[53:43] the season you go from church tomorrow
[53:45] morning when you get up crack open your
[53:47] Bible crack open a message book and
[53:50] spend some time see if the spirit of God
[53:52] will still speak to our hearts today
[53:55] amen let's pray
[53:58] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[54:00] goodness and your grace to us Lord
[54:03] Lord I Thank you for what you did
[54:05] through Luther and Calvin and zwingli
[54:08] and through comenius all these men are
[54:10] just reading about communities life how
[54:13] he had to leave the Czech Republic free
[54:15] flee persecution there lost a wife and
[54:17] two children and just had a very
[54:20] difficult uh
[54:22] difficult time with all the persecution
[54:23] there Lord
[54:25] those men sacrificed a lot and made and
[54:28] made and made stands for truth Lord
[54:31] I pray oh God that we would
[54:33] follow what they taught and then keep on
[54:36] moving on because there's it's not just
[54:38] a star it's the hand that's holding the
[54:40] star we want to be holding that hand
[54:42] walking in that light Lord all the way
[54:44] home oh God
[54:46] father I pray that you would speak to
[54:48] our hearts father Lord I pray that you
[54:50] would
[54:51] father free us from any foolish
[54:53] questions that might have ensnared our
[54:56] thoughts and stared our minds o God lord
[54:58] I pray that we'd push those foolish
[55:00] questions aside the distract us and take
[55:02] us anywhere but your word
[55:04] oh if even just gone straight to Adam
[55:06] has been a totally different story
[55:09] and how many times can we say if I just
[55:10] gone straight to Adam I'd just gone
[55:13] straight to the word in a different
[55:14] story Lord help us to do that father I
[55:17] pray we would establish us and settle us
[55:19] Lord and I pray fathers each one might
[55:21] tomorrow morning or even this evening
[55:23] open the book
[55:25] pray in them hear what your voice has to
[55:28] say that we might actually hear your
[55:30] voice speaking to our own hearts Lord
[55:32] and that would be with Revelation o God
[55:34] that we might see something we've never
[55:36] seen before because there's spirit in
[55:39] the word for the day
[55:40] Lord I pray to you
[55:42] moving us draw us closer you o God I
[55:45] pray in Jesus name
[55:47] amen amen
[55:52] speak my
