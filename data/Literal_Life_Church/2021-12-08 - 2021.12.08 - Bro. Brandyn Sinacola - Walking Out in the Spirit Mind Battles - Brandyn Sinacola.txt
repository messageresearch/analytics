TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter 8 and verse 15 and while you're turning there just a quick reminder of the potluck the sunday after service and then the christmas play at 5 p.m and sister sharon sent out a schedule for some um rehearsals and things for the kids so if you can make that and also if you didn't sign up for something and you'd like to sign up for something you can get with sister kendall text or talk to her tonight we had a good turnout after sunday so just want to thank you for that jumping on board and um just get with her if you want to bring something and she can let you know it's lacking and also we got an announcement for that came in tonight an apology from brother danny ratliff for being so late but um ben siebolt from lima ohio will be there saturday at 5 p.m and then also at 10 30 a.m on sunday so he went on to wanted to support those that meeting if we could are you happy to be a christian amen romans 8 15 to verse 17 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children than heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be we suffer with him that we may all may also may be also glorified together and then if you would first timothy 1 and verse 7. i'm sorry second timothy 1 and verse 7. for god hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind let's just pray one more time father bless your word bless your people i pray that all the cares of life god would be lifted now and that they would be fed something from you not from me lord but from you in jesus christ's name amen amen you can be seated i appreciate you coming out tonight i'm going to read a couple more places if you don't have to turn there first peter 5 and verse 6 and i'm just reading a lot to lay a foundation but maybe just refer to these real quick again in a minute and then get get to our thought tonight first peter 5. verse 6 humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he careth for you be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the grace but the god of all grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by christ jesus after that he ye have suffered a while so he just promised you that there's going to be suffering in this life after you have suffered for a while make you perfect establish you strengthen you and settle you those are those are some pretty powerful terms in this day that we live in that you could be settled to him be glory and dominion forever and ever amen i'm not going to turn there in my bible i got it here on my screen ephesians 6 10 starting at verse 10 finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places jump into verse 16 above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation something to cover your mind and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints and for me the utterance may be given unto me that i may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel so that the preaching of the word is going to be an important tool for you for which i'm an ambassador in bonds that therein i may speak boldly as i ought to speak and i want to talk tonight just continue a little bit down the path of of walking after the spirit and if i could maybe subtitle this that call it mind battles and i've just been listening to the different testimonies sunday night which i i just really enjoyed um hearing the the personal victories and and the people's lives and and you know i'm sure that there were many who didn't get up and speak them and i'm sure that there were many who were sitting there who thought well i don't have anything that i've got a personal victory on right now but you might not have something that you can get up and testify now but you will amen so i encourage you tonight to just hang on hold tight hear what i have to say keep coming keep pressing the battle and i pray god give you strength amen and be encouraged by his word so we we all deal with mind battles and and uh a lot of them from what i from what i was picking up on and sometimes it's just when the lord deals with the minister's heart he'll he'll start hearing everything kind of through that vein that channel so um you know as as the ones were given their testimony what i kept hearing was satan was attacking my mind and i kept hearing satan's attacking my mind and then brother paul gets up and he preaches on sunday and in condemnation well where is condemnation that's a battle in the mind that's satan attacking your mind trying to condemn you getting you to think that you're doing wrong or getting you to think that you're you're you're too far gone you're you're out of it's not truth amen if it was truth it would resonate from the inward man but it's not here it's up here and it might cloud the waters that that could touch your soul that your soul would speak back and say no that's not the truth and satan's voice can cloud that up and and stop that channel up because the mind gets so heavy and so thickened with the enemy's voice so we we all deal with mind battles so if we if we raised our hands and looked around everybody would have their hand raised so i i say that to say you know in in the mind battles and things satan will make you feel isolated and alone but you're not alone and you're not isolated everybody around you has either gone through a mind battle going through a mind battle or getting ready to go into a mind battle it's just it's it's the it's you know we think testing trials as something you know your car getting scratched or losing your wallet or you know something physical outward that you're going to experience a sickness or something but that's not always the case usually and actually probably in every instance that you go through in an outward trial there's something inward that goes with it and the inward is actually what would would cause you more harm than the outward amen are you awake tonight sometimes the mind battles are greater than others sometimes it's great in a in a certain season of life than other times so there might be a certain person who's who's maybe bet a specific way their their personality is a certain way and they just they lean more towards the mind battles the the battles are heavier on them they they can't uh maybe tolerate the mind battles as easy as somebody else but it might just be what that mind battle is because you might be maybe even critical of somebody but that's just because the mind battle hasn't touched the area in your life where you would act the same way so sometimes it's a season for a woman it's often um like a a change of life a menopause or or uh postpartum sisters say man i guess come on brothers you can say men too just don't don't say it to uh expressly but honest to goodness the prophet said that men can reach a certain life time in life and it's almost like a like a menopause for men and i've seen it i've seen it where the man gets almost into a we we would call it a midlife crisis and and maybe you know he can't afford to go by the sports car or something but we do some crazy things too get into a hobby that we have no clue what we're doing but by golly we're going to do it and put our mind to it but it's it's these certain seasons of life and and and the thing that i don't like okay and this is i i get i i have a lot of righteous anger right now at the devil because what i don't like is during those times in those seasons how how he can affect us in such a negative way to make us think that we're losing our mind that and that's a terrible feeling to feel and and if you've never felt it just pray for grace because it you just it's it's you can't grasp you can't hold a thought you can't grasp onto things you can't you just you feel like you're losing control of everything and you can't you you can't go through a normal day you can't i for some reason my wife was saying maybe the the effects of the stuff they gave me during surgery haven't worn off yet because twice not once but twice i ordered something online had it sent to kohl's went to pennies and signed in sitting in the curbside pickup and i'm sitting there watching people going in and out and bringing other people's stuff and i'm sitting there and i'm telling you what i had no clue that i was in the wrong spot i was wondering why in the world and so this lady comes out and she's asking you know did you guys sign in the app i said yeah i signed in in the app and i just happened to look down and something finally clicked and i said kohl's and i said you know what um i figured it out so then i go to the other store and because i took so long i had to go inside and get it i was just trying to save time i don't care about going in so that was the first time then i realized i ordered the wrong thing the wrong the wrong shirt so i took them back and i i ordered from again kohl's but i get out of my car and i walk in i walk into pennies this time and i'm standing in line and i walk up and i hold my phone out and she's she scans it and doesn't do nothing and she scans it and doesn't do nothing and she she takes my phone and she's looking at it and she goes oh um you got to go to kohl's and so i just said i like you guys better and then i had to walk out and go back to kohl's but i i'm telling you i i afterwards though and it wasn't a great mind battle i laughed it off but in those moments i thought there was absolutely no trigger that i was in the wrong place or anything and and i i just i had a thought i'm losing my mind and you're thinking that too but whatever that was worth but you know in letting off the pressure brother branham says that we're in a nervous neurotic age and he said that the doctors don't have the answer for it and and it's and this is something that i've experienced too just in in dealing with different ones or knowing some different stories as is he says that the doctors don't have the answers they just give you a tranquilizer and and it's just they're just as nervous as you are and they give you medication and he said he called it a tranquilizer what's a tranquilizer do it kind of numbs you puts you to sleep kind of it you you know you see they shoot them at animals and then the animals go down they're not bad they're still awake but they can't really move they they're the the fight uh nature that's in that animal goes away they kind of lay there there's nothing they can do and now i want to bring a good balance on this because i'm not saying quit taking the medicine if you're taking it if you're on medication if the doctor puts you on medication don't leave the service and say brother brandon said i can stop taking my medicine that's not what i'm saying but we have to we i i want to point you tonight to the source of a cure because these medications they they you know the prophet spoke real highly of medicine and medical science and he said you know he went to the doctors and he had friends who were doctors and i was listening to a message the other day and he said if you don't have a medical journal you should get one because there's there's all kinds of fascinating things in there and you might learn something about yourself and you know have a better quality of life but he's you know they they give you a medicine and it really does numb you and it it you lose you lose feeling it it might make you sleep more and and it actually takes certain elements of your personality which are a positive thing and it takes them out we um there's somebody i know and and i was kind of laughing with her a little bit the other day because um i walked in and you know her smile was what i remembered it to be and i said boy that was the most sincere smile that i've seen out of you in a long time nobody here okay so don't be wondering and i said that was the most pure smile that i've seen on your face in a long time and you know she's just like oh really you know i didn't know there was a difference and i and i said yeah so we got to talking about the medication she was on that that we knew she was taking and uh you know it just it takes certain elements of of you know her bubbly personality in it and it numbed them it took him out so you know she said what she said was helping her focus we were all seeing was like a blank like she's not there and it's sad you know that she needed the medicine to help her at the time but you feel bad because of all the effects of it are you with me so far but what i'm getting at is is it's a nervous age and and the nervous age and the tension in things it weighs on our minds and it affects our minds and and and then the devil just starts wreaking havoc on that and using it as a tool to give you mind battles and make you feel like you're going crazy i was reading today because i i you know i had those certain thoughts about the medication and and mental health and things and so i went and i and i just did a little just real brief research and they even say you know the the the medication they give you it can improve symptoms but it can't cure you so it's masking the problem so what i'm interested in is seeing the problem be dealt with so again like i said don't quit taking the medication if you're on medication it's helping you but what we need is for christ to come on the scene and you need christ to come in and like ephesians 6 said giving us our armor and our weapons for spiritual warfare so it's it's it's not a carnal warfare it's not somebody that you can lay your hands on and fight and argue with them it's it's spiritual warfare and it says and and paul was writing in ephesians and he and he wrote to pray always in the spirit and in the scriptures we read romans 8 and in another spot we read last time says the spirit helps our infirmities and praise when we don't know what to pray for so when you feel like you're you're losing your mind when you feel that nervous tension when you feel like everything is crumbling around you there's there's a right channel to get into to get help to actually go and and get the cure for the problem to affect what is actually going on inside of you because it's it's not it's not uh uh what the medical science would call a you know you you have bipolar or you know schizophrenic or just whatever they might deem that you have that's not the actual thing that's that's a medical name for a spiritual demon so what we want to deal with is the spiritual demon and i want to give you some things tonight to help with that first of all first peter said the god of all grace the god of all grace will establish you and strengthen you and settle you so i'm just going to keep pointing you to christ tonight that he's the answer that it's god's grace god give you grace in those times god give you the spirit of joy god give you the spirit of contentment because there might be a lot of things going on in your mind that's just you're not content you're running to and fro and you're you're looking at everybody else and get off social media first of all stay off social media if you struggle it's just that simple you're not going to miss anything in anybody else's life it's it's it's not really that important you can talk to them if they live miles away give them a call share pictures that's fine text a picture call him though find out how crazy life really is because a picture can paint a thousand words but it can paint a thousand positive words when all the negative is actually outside the frame of the picture like one of my daughter's closets she was showing me how clean the room was and i just happened to open the curtain and i said is this how you cleaned your room and it was a deer in the headlights looks good on the outside but you got to dig a little bit everybody's got dirty laundry everybody's got a sink full of dirty dishes okay so go to the right source you know we get we get down and when the mind battle is on and the pressure is on we want to release and we want to just shut the mind down and that's why entertainment and things is so appealing because it you just you shut down for 30 minutes or however long it is your mind just it just kind of puts you into neutral and you can just not think and and laugh or whatever it is and there's nothing wrong with that but if you're turning to that all the time you're not dealing with the source of the problem again it's just like taking a pill called entertainment amen you're just going to keep turning to it but it's not going to actually fix the problem that that is causing you to feel that way there's no lasting comfort in it amen in the greatest battle ever fought the prophet said it's the greatest battle ever fought is in the mind because that's where decisions are made so why am i this way why are we built this way why why do you have mind metals why is it such a why is between the ears such a horrible place sometimes that's because that's where decisions are made christ we we know these things i'm just stirring up your memory okay you know these things you've been taught well but it's it's the pressure in things and god is after the soul the inward man and satan said okay but i want to fight in the mind because if i can get them to doubt then that keeps it from getting to the soul where god wants to be so that's why that's that's the reason that's the why i just i thought maybe if we knew why we had the mind battle that would be helpful mind battles i was thinking about today's youth what a target they are for the enemy because if he can start putting scars in them at a young age that could last with them throughout their lifetime that could that could maybe keep them from making a decision to serve christ not not forever because if you're god you will come but maybe he could delay it as much as possible and and heap up the baggage that you're going to bring when you do come to christ and then when you do come to christ you're going to feel unworthy and that's going to make it last longer that you see the vicious cycle of the enemy so today's youth and you know they're dealing with things that i never i didn't have to deal with in school i thought i had it pretty bad but i watched today and it i mean satan has just pulled he's he's pulled out all the stops he's not holding back punches anymore he's trying to attack their minds he's he's you know really after him used to i think i said it here i read something you know used to for pornography you had to you had to work to go find it now you have to work not to see it why because satan is trying to pollute that mind while it's pure before it has a hope of of knowing anything better the way that god intended it to be it leaves them damaged scarred and hinders their faith are you still with me isaiah 60 1-3 and i just want especially the young people but everybody to know tonight that it's it's there's nothing wrong with you there's absolutely nothing wrong with you this is the battle that we face this is the enemy we fight every day he he's the accuser of the brethren day and night right verse verse 1 arise shine for thy light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth in gross darkness the people gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee and the gentiles shall come to thy light and kings to the brightness of thy rising so there's a gross darkness among us today and it's on the there's there's darkness around us but then there's gross darkness on the people and that includes you but i i want you to catch on to the hope tonight that's in christ that his light is going to shine upon you his light will pierce the darkness of your mind of your mental battles his light is going to pierce it amen and he's he's going to give you hope when you're distraught he's going to give you healing when your body's sick i think one of the worst things is is these these sicknesses that that last for a long time you know and then the devil will start working on someone saying well it's your faith but maybe god just needs you to get more out of that trial maybe it's not so much your faith maybe it's what god has in store for you to establish you and to make you feel secure on the other side of the trial amen so catch catch the things that that the scripture is saying the grace the god of all grace the light that he'll shine upon you in the midst of all these things of the gross darkness of the mind battles i don't think i sent these quotes to you uh isabelle but this first one i'll just read it but there is a pressure on the people today and that pressure has no limitation or any denominational lines well i'm in the message i don't have mind battles you're lying it has no limitations it has no age line it has no respect of person it's on young and old good and bad it's on everybody pressure he said that's right it's it's a time and in that rushing and speeding it gets you to a nervous tension the wife say something a little contrary you want to fly off temper husbands say something you'll pat your foot and tell them to get in the room see well now husband i don't want no words with you go out there wife oh i'm so nervous see why what's the matter see all this together this tension builds up then the results of it is uh he says saying something you didn't mean to say all this pressure all the mind battle all the the tension you know in in studying this i found myself you know you just you you carry the burden for the service and things and and that that's a it's a it's a privilege but it's a pressure too there's some pressure that goes with it and you feel that pressure and then you feel like all the other things you got to do they they decided to change the system we work in on monday and it's just been a mess and things and so all this pressure build up and i thank god because as i'm studying this i start recognizing something said and my initial inside reaction is is knee-jerk you know say something back or react this way and i thank the lord because because i've been studying this i could catch that and i could say no i'm not going to respond that way because i know what's happening i'm under pressure right now and it's built up and if i'm not careful it's going to spill out of my mouth and it's going to cause more harm than it is good see the devil i was thinking about this the devil wants to build up pressure to where you blow off the handle you know something you can take a steam engine and you could pack that thing so full of steam that it'll explode but you see it it does need just enough pressure from the steam to move forward so we have pressure in our lives i believe to move us forward really there's there's a pressure that god allows on us because it drives us to him or it should and if you don't drive to him you're going to drive to something else and blow up so god will just say okay we'll patch that we'll put a little more steam you get going forward he puts on the pressure and he's standing there just waiting for you to come to him to let off the pressure to to regulate that just right we need christ we need the the master conductor amen sunday mornings we just let that go because everybody knows what we're saying sunday mornings hurry and get to church frantic finding everything get everyone to the car without one going out the other door and going back inside no stay in the car i'm the only one i guess that deals with this amen brandon amen thanks brother by the time you get to church you're a nervous wreck and then poor gideon's up here trying to lead songs and he's wondering why everyone's so tight on him and then maybe this isn't gideon's mind battle but just as an example to show that how this just unravels and it spreads so gideon's up here trying to lead songs the minister's up here trying to preach and you're you're all locked up because you've been in a hurry and and the steam's all blown up and and you're just you're all just blown up and you know you just you don't got no more energy left you just you sit down in your seat and made it praise the lord i'm here that's what counts right is that we're in church and then poor gideon and poor ministers up here and we're trying to trudge and we're trying to we're trying to get through and and then satan starts working on our minds you thought you had a gift joke's on you you know i mean it's just and you say well brother well come on be real we're all human beings right but you know you see but i'm just saying and it spreads you know dad blows up at wife and the kids on the way to church and squelches the spirit there and then you know brother paul said it many times pulling the parking lot bless god we're going to have good service forgive me let's go into church spirit's already squelched it's life it's life right but it's just the things that that build up pressure in us people know that we're at the end why is there gross darkness on the people well one this nation rejected christ and they know that we're at the end even if they don't know that we're at the end they know we're at the end they might not be able to explain it like you and i can they don't they don't have the understanding that we do but we're at the coming of the lord something is fixing to happen and it causes people to be nervous prophet talked about a a deer you know eating or a lamb and it's and it's eaten and it's it's calm and it's serene and then all of a sudden it starts getting twitchy and it's and it's nervous and it keeps looking up and its ears keep going back and things and and it's because there's a predator coming up something's fixing to happen they don't know what it is they don't know where the lion's at but it's it's causing a nervous tension there's there's there's a sense in people that they know something's going wrong and the devil knows it too he knows his time is short so he turns up the heat on us now i want to give a couple examples satan brought jesus a battle in his mind of doubts or he tried to of who he was i think one of our greatest battles that we fight is is knowing who we are in christ but satan jesus went through that same mind battle because when satan came and tempted him in the wilderness in the desert he said if you really are the son of god do this if you are he didn't come and say you know what you're the son of god do this if if you really are if you really are a son and daughter of god if you really are a christian then you wouldn't be doing that if you really were then you'd be doing this you see the mind battle and jesus had to go through that same mind battle and overcome it by what the word did you know that satan gave jesus suicidal thoughts i should just leave that there satan gave jesus suicidal thoughts he took him up i think it was the third temptation on the highest point of the temple and told him to jump off can you imagine that how bold satan is and can you imagine if you've had those thoughts that jesus had them too that you're not the only person listen i'm i'm trying to bring you comfort tonight and i pray this is it's wednesday and we're all tired the maniac of gadira he needed jesus to come his way that was the source they tried medical science tried everything that they had knowledge to at the time even to binding him in chains that should hold a man who was being harmful to himself but the demons were so great on legion that he was breaking the chains medical science had no hold on this man but when jesus came the man received his deliverance the woman at the well had something in her spirit that locked her up and made her run after men she wasn't able to settle down and sit still her her her adulteries built up within her and and made her nervous drove her to do things she didn't want to be doing she wasn't able to settle down and sit still she wasn't able to be content seemingly she was afraid of something these are just my thoughts okay maybe afraid of commitment maybe afraid of giving her heart fully to someone so her answer her own answer was to run from it but she was running from the thing that she had a longing in her heart for was a desire for relationship in a safe relationship a consistent relationship somebody that would love her for for who she is and not for what they were getting out of the relationship but she and herself didn't know how to get it can you imagine just put yourself in her shoes for a minute the mind battles that this woman had had to go through not something deep down not really wanting to be what she was but not knowing how to get an escape out of it and and and that's just how we we get into situations sometimes often times i think it was james wrote off drawn away of your own lust but sometimes satan just ensnares you he he's a trickster he puts a little trap out there for you and you get ensnared by it but then when you get ensnared by it you don't know how to get out of it you feel stuck you feel nobody else is going through this nobody else is going to know what i'm going through nobody else has ever experienced this before when the bible says there's nothing new under the sun and i think it also says there's no temptation but what's common to man paraphrasing a little bit there so this woman didn't know she was locked in this in this unfortunate world to herself in her own mind but then jesus came that was the answer the people thought they had the answer well let's put shame on her maybe if we shame her she'll get out of this situation she'll realize what she's doing is wrong we'll put her going to the well at a different time than everyone else you know this was man's concoctions of how to deal with this woman's heart but then jesus came along and jesus dealt with the heart issue the prophet of our day was a neurotic what a pressure to be under to be a leader to be sensitive to god and his people at every moment god wanted to use you god wants to use us but imagine the pressure knowing maybe not fully knowing what was going on but knowing what was going on knowing what his position was in this age as god unfolded it that pressure the neurotic that it would it would just build up the pressure until he said that's why he had to go hunting get away from people so that they weren't pulling on the spirit on the gift get away get out enjoy nature enjoy god what did he say he'd go do more than hunting is just get alone with god what was the prophet's answer for the neurotic state that he felt get alone with god are you catching this tonight so this this kept burning on my heart i'm almost done do you have those quotes did you get them i see you a thumbs up hold up monitors go ahead and pull that first one up so i'm going to read through this and then i'm just going to maybe i'll comment on it after that she had two lovely daughters and she married a fine man a brother huff and he was a millwright he'd had it one of his fingers and thumbs cut off a very nice brother and they had two they had twins and another girl making three children and the twins were staunch christians they were ube people but they really believed god and so they won little one little girl going to school she got a complex watch this now watch this scenario the girls tell her well why don't you smoke like we do you think you're better than we are why don't you go to dances now they didn't go to dances nor neither did they smoke or drink and they made fun of the healthier girl she could just say hump let them jump in a river i'm the one serving christ they don't want to let them go ahead so that's one personality okay but the other one she began to think well maybe i could do something and she built a complex and got nervous she went insane she's 18 years old a genius only 18 years old and this is the situation that brother branham's dealing with she one of those perfectionists gotta watch it myself she even teaches opera and plays overtures and teaches music at 18 years old see just a real smart girl look at the the qualities that god put in her and satan's trying to take that and so she a real good christian and they couldn't understand it they was country people way back out in the country and the other girls would talk about her so this is another spot actually so what we just read was after the prophet had wet and dealt with the the situation and then this is before and the other girls would talk about her you know the two girls and tell them how they were what part of life they were missing and how they should live like the rest of the girls and one girl was able to just to override it this other one had a complex and she felt real bad about it and just kept going away and drifting further back and is worrying about it and finally she's she's got a mental breakdown and she's in an insane ward this is just skipping through the quotes here now the girl there's no physical break in the girl there's no physical she's perfectly healthy but it's so hard to explain and it really cannot be explained what it is her spirit has wandered now you got to catch her spirit and bring it back to the place see and she just a little they raised those children to serve the lord and put them in school and they were really grounded in christ not to do the things that's wrong but there it went now what i'm catching from this was i was reading it is the one girl could just blow it off i'm a christian i'm serving christ i'm going forward with god but this other girl had a different personality okay she had a different personality and the pressure was just too much for and so what i'm reading in between the lines catching here is that she gave in and started out and doing the things that they were telling her she should be doing to have a good time and then that brings the con that brings condemnation conviction right condemnation and then she gets stuck in that and it makes you nervous condemnation will make you nervous satan will make you nervous by condemning you and then she just she gets to worrying about it but maybe she's in that tailspin of not knowing how to get out of it and so she just gets worrying so much until she has a mental breakdown a nervous breakdown so uh where are we at so now this is another situation he tells of look just a few moments ago and gazed back to a little boy had the very same thing exactly and at we we went there one night a brother writes in oroville as the boy's name was just a com a complete break and he you know when he tried to run out run me out of the house as good of a friend as orville and i are just real like i'd be his father i married his father and mother together and he's just jump up and scream get out of here get out of here get out of here see so brother bradham said it wasn't no longer the boy he was he was dealing with the the boy had a nervous breakdown he had a he had a mental break this wasn't he was acting out of the ordinary now what we had to do there was go out into the line of spirit and catch that boy's spirit see a lot of grief watch these things go back a lot of grief had come to his little heart he's young and he had seen a lot and just brought him right back to the place where he should be you see in a few days he was all right now that's the same thing you got to do on this this other case i have seen it and i know that it's true but now i request you all to pray now that god will help me to find this little girl out into a place where she don't know where she's at then bring her back to her place that avenue comes through faith she can't have faith for herself she don't know where she's at or anything see it's got to take our faith here now you have these two situations and it's grief piled up on these young hearts and that grief became overwhelming for them and they didn't know what to do with it and it just it got them so worried and nervous that it broke them up it broke their mind had a nervous breakdown took on complexes and things but you watched the answer in each situation with the girl brother branham said he's the holy spirit revealed to him she was just blank staring at him said she looked beautiful big big eyes and things but she was just looking at him empty and he said when the holy spirit came on the scene it went back into her spirit and caught her and brought her back to herself and he the the gal's name was margaret and he said margaret you always wanted to marry a preacher since you were a little girl we don't i don't understand these things fully but brother branham had to take her the holy spirit not brother branham the holy spirit who's still alive today had to take that young girl back to a time when she was pure before she had gotten tainted by the things of the world before back when she had a pure desire that was really her she really wanted to grow up and marry a minister and the spirit took her back to that spot because it was truth inside of her heart so what am i i'm trying to get to you tonight is the answer for these mind battles and things you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free to get into the spirit to walk after the spirit not after the flesh is how we keep from breaking up to to to run after god you say well you're making you know i'm not trying to make something spiritual out of natural things but if you have an ailment in your body you need healing what's the answer go to prayer be obedient to the word come forward let us lay hands on you anoint you with oil because the the bible says that the prayer of faith shall save the sick amen you you turn to the word i just want to make sure i say this all right so we're almost there almost done so i just want to comment a couple more things so you watch the two different personalities in these nature of those girls and maybe as babies you know because you can watch little kids and you can pick up on things and their personality as as they start getting older maybe as babies one was a leader and the other more of a follower one cares what others think they're more shy or timid maybe they want to fit in you know country people they he said they're country people they might not have had a lot so they want to fit in so they see all the other things that the other the other kids have to one it's no big deal who cares but to the other it meant something looking for acceptance doesn't want to hurt anyone's feelings maybe a peacemaker then he said she was a perfectionist she was nervous she she she worried you know a perfectionist can be good in one sense but then in the other you you it makes you worry you do get nervous just by having that quality trait in you but i just thought it was interesting the spirit wonders and you got to catch the spirit bring it back so in summary of how we overcome these things you with me just a couple more minutes we take our burdens to him and let off the pressure through prayer like brother tony was preaching take it to the lord and leave it there have yet when's the last time that that you really spent some time in prayer and the thing that's been bothering you and that you feel that pressure building up when's the last time that you just knelt before god and and let it out or does the neurotic age have us so busy we can't find time for that what's another way to overcome these mind battles to get into his presence i'm going to say it's important to come to church but you have a right as a christian to pull his presence down when you're not at church too now we balance those things out because now somebody's thinking well then what do i got to come to church for if i can bring his presence down at home will you stay out of church for a while and let me know how that goes get in his presence doubts when you're having doubts of who you are i love the scripture in romans because it says when you have doubts of who you are get into his presence and hear his word because the inward man the spirit that he's that christ has placed in you something answers back to the word that's being preached and says amen so you think you know man i don't i don't have i don't have the holy ghost i'm not a christian i i'm on the verge of leaving i i've sent away my day of grace but then when the when the words coming forward and you hear the preacher say but that you haven't sinned away your day of grace if there's something on the inside that that still desires god then you haven't send your day a way of grace and something on the inside of you says amen now listen to me i've had it mind battle and the preaching of the word goes forward and your spirit is saying amen to every word that's being preached you feel encouraged you feel you feel power of the spirit and minutes later those thoughts come right back and you start feeling you start losing those feelings that came over you when the inward man was saying amen you know what you do think back to two minutes ago when you know that you said amen on the inside amen amen we're a three-part being body and spirit are the inlets to the soul and the soul is the is the inner is where the inner man is the soul is either where faith or word outlie and i and this never really took hold when i'm listening to the greatest battle ever fought until i was listening to it this time and the prophet was explaining and these are just my own words to try to condense and simplify what we have to do is remove all of the senses you got to get all the senses out of the picture forget how you're feeling right now just let the word come down that channel of your thoughts and meet your soul where free will is because then when it meets the free will and that inward man says amen that's accepting the word get rid of all the senses and just let let let the word meet your soul for a little bit amen and choose the word it's j it's that simple choose the word if you have sickness the prophet said commit your case to god and go on as if it was all over don't dwell on it the best that you can we can turn it over and over and over in our minds and get nervous it's got to be cancer i am going to die i say that kind of jokingly but you know those are real thoughts for for me i i lean too far the other way where i not that i go where i'm looking for death how do you say that without it sounding so bad but paul said for me to live as christ but to die is gain when when you know that when that you have a body waiting already on the other side there becomes a longing there then then you can start singing beulah land i'm longing for you i'm i'm homesick because there's something on the inside that knows that this is not the real thing amen you can stand to your feet i pray something tonight was a help to you i can promise you i don't get up just to be heard and i wonder just um if the musicians want to play something soft and if you want to bow your head sometimes it's easier to lift your hands with knowing everybody's heads are bowed and eyes are closed and if you just want to lift up your hand and and say not to me but to god and say lord i i need to let off the pressure the pressure's getting too great amen god bless you my hands are raised too the pressure is just too great i feel like i'm i feel like i'm coming apart at the seams i wonder i wonder if you could just picture yourself coming before god just now and and get out of your mind don't don't let this be a picture of god on a a great big throne that you come and you're so tiny in front of [Music] think of this as is jesus [Music] and he kneels down because you're kneeling down in the altar of your heart [Music] and you're just saying lord i can't i don't know how much more i can take and jesus kneels down beside you and wraps his arms around you and pulls you up to his chest [Music] and for just a moment let it be just you and god forget the pressures of life if something keeps coming to your mind right now it keeps you just brother brandon i can't get my mind to settle why don't you tell god about it right now let christ have that give it to him tell him tell him about it jesus just wraps his arms around you and hugs you real tight you know maybe maybe you've never had a tight hug but just just picture a tight hug wrapping you in his arms and he just whispers sweetly i care i care give it to him heavenly father we come before you lord and lord sometimes god we know that you're simple god you hide yourself in simplicity and you reveal yourself in simplicity and so we know that the answers are simple but sometimes lord it seems so hard it's so hard to release our cares to you sometimes sometimes it's just the way that we're bent it's the it's the way that our personality is or the way that we're natured but father you made us that way and you made us that way for a purpose so help us lord we just ask for your help god when we can't give it to you fully we don't know how we don't know what that looks like [Music] father help us lord help us to let it go and i pray jesus love every heart god love every heart in here love them god until they just give it to you bless each one now in jesus christ's name amen amen if you need prayer i'm happy to pray with you but why don't you just you can be dismissed if you got to go but why don't you just just give it a few minutes and in the busyness of the day and the busyness of life why don't you just close your eyes and lift your hands and just just have a moment with the lord just take take the time your bed will be there when you get home just take a few minutes and just just let yourself just let god bathe you in his presence amen god bless you tonight
