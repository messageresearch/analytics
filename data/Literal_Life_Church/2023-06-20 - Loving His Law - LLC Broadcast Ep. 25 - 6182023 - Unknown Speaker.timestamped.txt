[7:16] [Music]
[7:25] thou has dealt well with thy servant O
[7:28] Lord according to Thy word teach me good
[7:31] judgment and knowledge for I have
[7:33] believed thy Commandments before I was
[7:35] afflicted I went astray
[7:38] before I was afflicted I went astray but
[7:40] now have I kept Thy word thou art good
[7:43] and do us good teach me thy statues the
[7:47] proud have forged a lie against me but I
[7:49] will keep thy precepts with my whole
[7:52] heart their heart is as fat as Greece
[7:54] but I Delight in thy law it is good for
[7:58] me that I have been Afflicted that I
[8:01] might learn thy statues look at the good
[8:03] that comes out of being Afflicted going
[8:06] through things that's a pretty strong
[8:08] word being Afflicted he said it's good
[8:11] for me to be afflicted because what I
[8:13] learn out of it is your statues
[8:15] the law of thy mouth is better unto me
[8:17] than a thousands of gold and silver
[8:20] 97
[8:22] skip to verse 97.
[8:24] oh how I love thy law it is my
[8:29] meditation all the day
[8:31] oh how I love that's what I'd like to
[8:33] title this tonight loving his law
[8:37] because law and the the the talk about
[8:40] the law of God
[8:42] has a bad connotation to it
[8:46] right and Satan's done that has a bad
[8:48] connotation but here's a man of God
[8:51] especially after he had sinned now he's
[8:54] saying Lord I love thy law
[8:57] I love the law of God I love the
[9:00] precepts of God there's not too many
[9:02] people say that but he's come to a place
[9:04] that I want to come to Lord I love thy
[9:06] law
[9:07] you'd have to understand the power
[9:09] behind God's law in order to say that
[9:13] I love thy law you don't have your
[9:15] people saying it you don't hear too many
[9:18] people that are Lawless saying it I love
[9:20] the law they want to get rid of
[9:22] policemen and be a lawless nation and
[9:25] sometimes you have teeny teenagers
[9:27] you'll never hear them saying I love the
[9:30] rules of this house
[9:31] I love the laws of this home you rarely
[9:35] hear it saying you don't hear people
[9:36] saying concerning the laws of God but
[9:38] David's saying it Lord I love thy law it
[9:41] is my meditation all the Day verse 113
[9:44] if you would
[9:45] 113 I hate vain thoughts but thy law do
[9:50] I love
[9:52] verse 163.
[9:55] verse 163.
[9:58] I hate and abhor lying but thy law do I
[10:03] love in verse 165 great peace have they
[10:07] which love thy law
[10:11] how many want peace tonight
[10:13] great peace have they that love thy law
[10:16] and nothing shall offend them now this
[10:19] Psalm 119 is set apart in very special
[10:24] uh in itself because of it keeps having
[10:28] a theme to it and the theme is in all uh
[10:33] 176 verses of it that's the amazing
[10:35] thing if you read it the theme runs
[10:37] through all uh 176 verses it's I believe
[10:41] I think it's the longest you'll have to
[10:43] correct me if I'm wrong but I think it's
[10:45] the longest Psalm that's in the Book of
[10:47] Psalms and it's the 119th Psalm but
[10:50] what's interesting is about it it has a
[10:52] theme in every verse and we're going to
[10:54] talk about this really the theme is
[10:56] loving his law loving his precepts
[10:58] David's saying I love your Commandments
[11:00] and so you correct me on this as well if
[11:04] you read it through I could only find
[11:06] two verses that don't mention these
[11:10] things every verse besides two and I
[11:13] mean it now coming correct me if you
[11:15] find me wrong okay that's fine I only
[11:17] found two verses that didn't have these
[11:19] things in every verse his his law his
[11:23] word his precepts his testimonies his
[11:27] Commandments his judgments and his
[11:30] statutes are in every verse but two
[11:33] so I think we know the theme
[11:37] and that is he has come to a place that
[11:40] he loves his law he loves his precepts
[11:43] he loves his Commandments everything
[11:45] that's come from God he's in love with
[11:47] him and he's not running from them he's
[11:49] not questioning them
[11:51] he's come into the world that this is
[11:53] the only world to live in is God's
[11:55] precepts God's quotes God's what do you
[11:58] ever want to whatever you want to call
[12:00] him they're quotes from God and they
[12:02] come through God's prophets there's
[12:04] quotes of Moses that's the quotes of the
[12:06] prophet and so he's living on all the
[12:08] quotes and he's valuing all the quotes
[12:10] he's saying this all has meaning to me
[12:12] and I I'm not running from it I'm not
[12:14] resisting it I'm not bucking up against
[12:17] it I may want to understand some of them
[12:19] more but there's one thing for sure I
[12:21] have learned I love your law so all
[12:25] these things are what God spoke to his
[12:28] people through his Prophet all these
[12:31] things are things God spoke to his
[12:33] people through his Prophet back at that
[12:35] time and I don't know if he had uh had
[12:39] this strong love for them before he
[12:41] broke the law himself how many eurasians
[12:43] say David broke the law himself David
[12:45] brought broke the thing that thou shall
[12:48] not commit adultery and he was with
[12:50] another woman that was not his his wife
[12:53] and not taken as his wife so he broke
[12:55] that so I don't know if David come into
[12:57] this deeper love for the law of God
[12:59] after he made a mistake a lot of times
[13:01] we do if we're really broken and we're
[13:04] real sincere about our sin then we
[13:06] develop a deeper love for what we
[13:09] ignored in other words he had to trample
[13:11] upon a bunch of precepts as a king he
[13:14] had to ignore and say this doesn't apply
[13:16] to me and it's not important he had to
[13:19] make it less important in order to
[13:21] commit adultery with Bathsheba he had to
[13:24] trample upon or he didn't forget because
[13:27] he knew but he had to say you know what
[13:29] I'm I'm taking a vacation
[13:32] I'm taking a vacation from certain laws
[13:35] of God because I want this woman
[13:38] sometimes after we make a mistake and we
[13:41] defy and go against God's law we pay for
[13:44] it because how many know David paid for
[13:45] it we can pay there's something but
[13:48] there's something good that we get out
[13:50] of it can you say man and that is maybe
[13:52] what David got was such this deep deep
[13:56] love for the law of God I don't want to
[13:59] ever ever resist it again I don't want
[14:02] to trample upon it these things are not
[14:05] just words in a book they're just not
[14:07] words in the tablet but God gave them to
[14:10] me to protect me
[14:13] God gave them to me to keep me guarded
[14:16] from the things that I would get into
[14:18] and now I'm not looking for ways around
[14:20] them I love them
[14:23] all I know is that his life was 100
[14:26] percent trustworthy of what God said
[14:28] there's not an ounce of question or
[14:32] resistance in David he's basically
[14:34] saying
[14:35] I may not have been all in before but
[14:37] I'm all in now I love your precepts I
[14:40] love your law so this this life of David
[14:44] that he come into it would be another
[14:46] extreme of what we see in the world
[14:48] today this would be the Other Extreme of
[14:50] what we see in the world because the
[14:51] world is mocking the precepts of God the
[14:54] world is saying it's out of date the
[14:56] world is saying it doesn't work world
[14:58] the world says many in the world say
[15:00] there you know there is no God number
[15:02] one but then a lot of them are saying if
[15:04] this is God this has no value anymore
[15:06] that's crazy stuff that's stupid stuff
[15:08] so this is if you have that extreme that
[15:11] you live in in the world that there's no
[15:12] value for the precepts of God in other
[15:14] words God says something and they decide
[15:17] whether it's relevant or not and they
[15:19] dump it out that's the world we live in
[15:21] I think David is the Other Extreme of
[15:24] the world we live in and that is he's
[15:26] not just in between but he's actually
[15:28] saying they're saying I hate God's laws
[15:30] I don't need God's laws I don't need to
[15:33] live my life according to God's word and
[15:35] David's saying I can't live without the
[15:37] laws of God I can't function without the
[15:41] precepts of God the littlest little
[15:43] detail on how to live I need it to live
[15:46] by but here I love the law and guess
[15:49] what this is David's saying this before
[15:51] Calvary so before the possibility is the
[15:54] holy spirit coming in in an image
[15:56] individual and living the law by the
[15:59] spirit this is before the spirit is on
[16:01] the soul yet this is before Calvary this
[16:04] is this is way before there's any
[16:06] possibility of of the laws being written
[16:09] in the heart or in the Soul by the Holy
[16:12] Ghost before that David's already saying
[16:15] I love it I want to live by it
[16:17] that's amazing friends because we got
[16:19] the blessing of calvary
[16:21] we've got the blessing of living a holy
[16:23] ghost life the amen are on the inside
[16:26] that in the soul when the flesh even
[16:29] says I don't want it the soul says amen
[16:31] Lord I want it I desire thy laws I want
[16:34] your word I want what your Prophet said
[16:36] I want it I want it it was sent for me
[16:39] it's not sent for everybody
[16:42] it's that's the reality of it I wish the
[16:45] whole world could receive it but it's
[16:47] not sent for everybody I want the love
[16:49] of God in my heart that I know that it's
[16:51] set for me and I want to embrace it I
[16:53] want to take all of it can you say amen
[16:55] and so they had nothing to live it by
[16:57] the spirit but David loves it anyway he
[17:00] Embraces it David changes his attitude
[17:02] towards the statues and precepts of God
[17:05] his mind had changed to love them and
[17:08] not to try to get around them because
[17:10] human nature and the serpent nature is
[17:13] to get around the laws of God but you
[17:17] see now God breathes on a generation to
[17:20] give us precepts and principles that are
[17:23] meant for the generation as well that's
[17:25] just the way I believe it because the
[17:27] people in Moses they would have had to
[17:29] believe the same thing the people that
[17:31] Nathan's they would have had to believe
[17:32] the same thing the people in Isaiah and
[17:34] Jeremiah because there were other
[17:36] prophets and some of them would have
[17:37] said no you know what I'm sticking with
[17:39] what he said back there but yet Jeremiah
[17:41] it was addressed forcing the children of
[17:43] Israel going into idols and different
[17:45] things so now he had to address what was
[17:47] going on for the day can you say amen
[17:49] and so you couldn't say well I'm going
[17:51] to believe this prophet and not this one
[17:53] no because God's breathing on a
[17:55] generation saying I love my people that
[17:57] I may give some precepts for them to be
[18:00] able to understand for their day
[18:02] in their own language you ought to thank
[18:04] God it's in English for you
[18:06] a lot of countries don't have that don't
[18:08] have as they have so much access but God
[18:10] breathed on this generation
[18:12] God
[18:13] brought his word to our generation
[18:17] and it's more up to date I think I said
[18:18] this Sunday I preached this Sunday and I
[18:20] don't have
[18:22] as many here but I'm going to preach
[18:24] anyway tonight
[18:25] this word is more up to date than
[18:28] anything I've found
[18:29] it's more up to date than it ever was
[18:31] it's more relevant than it ever has been
[18:33] he gave us his word and he's put
[18:35] Protections in place and you start
[18:37] playing with them then you're going to
[18:39] have you're going to open yourself up to
[18:41] Spirits in your home in your mind in
[18:44] your life God's put Protections in place
[18:46] Mr said Luther Martin Luther said this
[18:49] if you preach the gospel with all of its
[18:52] aspects with the exception of dealing
[18:55] with the issues specifically for your
[18:57] time you are not preaching the gospel at
[19:01] all
[19:03] because the convictions of the Gospel
[19:05] the gospel is the good news when you
[19:08] preach Redemption when you preach it's
[19:10] for your age too and when you preach it
[19:12] you're going to be blasting out and
[19:14] warning people of The Temptations of the
[19:17] age
[19:18] but you're not just going to keep
[19:19] preaching The Temptations and keep
[19:21] preaching that this world is all dirty
[19:23] and the spirits are there you're going
[19:25] to bring around a hope in Calvary and
[19:27] the good news I've got an atonement for
[19:29] you I've got an answer for you it hasn't
[19:31] changed since Calvary I don't care how
[19:34] bad the modern day gets his blood is
[19:37] powerful enough to change a life his
[19:40] blood reaches to the deepest Mirey clay
[19:42] his blood has the answer for any
[19:44] depression his blood has the answer from
[19:47] any mental breakdown can you say mine
[19:49] his power is there for us he gave it to
[19:52] us we just have to receive it
[19:55] now Josh McDonald says some things here
[19:57] a couple things about the principles of
[19:59] God and then we'll just bring it to a
[20:00] close two teenagers
[20:02] bored on a hot summer night
[20:05] remember that a neighbor has a backyard
[20:08] pool
[20:09] they also remember that the neighbors
[20:11] are on vacation they decide to sneak
[20:13] over to enjoy a refreshing swim they
[20:15] giggle as they clamor over the tall
[20:16] backyard fence willfully ignoring the
[20:20] posted signs no trespassing and no
[20:23] swimming
[20:24] the girl cautiously makes her way across
[20:27] the unlit backyard as her boyfriend
[20:28] races to the diving board with one hard
[20:31] bounce
[20:33] he hits his body he throws his body high
[20:36] into the air the girl's laugh turns to a
[20:39] shriek as she reaches the pool's Edge
[20:41] and realizes there is no water in that
[20:44] pool
[20:46] the impact of the boy's dive snaps his
[20:49] neck instantly paralyzing him for life
[20:55] so Josh McDowell makes the comment the
[20:57] homeowners didn't post the warnings to
[20:58] make to take the fun
[21:01] from the boy's life
[21:04] but to protect those who are around the
[21:06] pool
[21:08] in choosing to disregard the posted
[21:11] warnings he moved himself into a
[21:15] dangerous spot
[21:19] I say it again in choosing because it's
[21:21] a choice everybody right
[21:24] when God has his precepts in front of us
[21:26] and the world wisdom of the world it's a
[21:28] choice it's a choice after what I preach
[21:30] Sunday it's a choice
[21:32] got to choose
[21:34] and in choosing to disregard posted
[21:37] warnings because as I preached Sunday
[21:39] some things are not you have you've
[21:41] sinned already but this has the
[21:44] potential to lead you into sin this is a
[21:46] warning sign this is something be
[21:48] careful this that could lead in this
[21:50] direction can you say Amen they ignored
[21:52] and by choosing to disregard posted
[21:54] warnings I think the message has a lot
[21:57] of posted warnings for us in doing that
[22:00] he this kid moved himself into Danger
[22:03] and so he's like this young man we often
[22:05] don't see the looming dangers or we
[22:08] minimize the consequences of stepping
[22:10] into sin how much can it hurt
[22:12] we ask ourselves
[22:15] unfortunately you and I have a very
[22:17] limited perspective
[22:19] God on the other hand sees every
[22:22] possible scenario
[22:24] and their resulting joys
[22:27] and sorrows
[22:29] we have a very limited perspective
[22:32] but God has the greatest perspective
[22:35] and God sees every possible scenario and
[22:41] the resulting Joys and sorrows
[22:44] George you should say Joys or Sorrows
[22:46] because the scenarios could be joys or
[22:49] could be Sorrows God sees all that he
[22:52] sees the scenarios
[22:55] he says have you ever entered one of
[22:56] those corn mazes
[22:58] and they're having those now I don't
[23:00] know if you've been through a corn maze
[23:01] yet
[23:02] but at every Junction in a corn maze
[23:05] you're saying should I turn right should
[23:07] I turn left perhaps and you're trying to
[23:09] figure out the corn means okay trying to
[23:11] go through it and with every Wrong Turn
[23:13] and Dead End you get more confused about
[23:15] where you are in the maze
[23:18] and the location of the correct path
[23:19] leading to the exit if you only had a
[23:22] bird's eye view it would be a lot easier
[23:25] can you say Amen if you had a guide a
[23:28] trustworthy Source perch the top of a
[23:31] real high ladder you'd have help in
[23:33] making the right choices to successfully
[23:36] navigate the maze in life we can
[23:39] consistently make right choices and
[23:41] enjoy much good in life by following
[23:44] God's guidelines and God's boundaries
[23:48] can you say Amen
[23:51] he has a much taller ladder he's looking
[23:53] from a much taller place
[23:56] and he sees this maze how many would
[23:58] agree we're in a maze of this world how
[24:00] many would agree that the young people
[24:02] were in her maze a corn maze trying to
[24:05] navigate which direction to go
[24:08] it was way worse than it was 20 years
[24:10] ago way worse than it was 10 years ago
[24:13] it's a corn maze
[24:15] how wonderful it would be and how
[24:17] wonderful it is I can tell you tonight
[24:19] we've got a god with a bird's eye view
[24:23] let's take it further we got a guy with
[24:25] an we got a god with an eagle's View
[24:28] because God the Great Eagle is looking
[24:31] from the top and he can see go this way
[24:33] go this way go this way and this will
[24:35] get you out of this world and bring you
[24:37] to a rapture I said it'll bring you to a
[24:40] rapture this word this word is not just
[24:44] to keep us holy Christians it's to bring
[24:47] us to a rapture
[24:50] do you believe that
[24:52] he's he's he's saying God says it this
[24:55] way do you believe that I love you and
[24:57] want to bless you with provision and
[24:59] protection then commit to my boundaries
[25:01] they are good they are for your good
[25:03] because I am good
[25:05] from God's Eternal perspective God does
[25:07] life with us asking
[25:10] do you want to avoid heartache in your
[25:12] life follow my priesthoods don't deviate
[25:15] you want to avoid addiction
[25:17] follow my precepts don't deviate you
[25:20] want to be successful in business follow
[25:23] my precepts don't deviate from it you
[25:25] want to experience true meaningful love
[25:30] follow my precepts and don't deviate
[25:33] from them
[25:34] you might have to wait for genuine real
[25:37] love but don't ever go away from his
[25:39] precepts
[25:43] but sometimes we get in our heads that
[25:44] we know better than God
[25:47] so we make willful choices outside of
[25:49] his boundaries and then must suffer the
[25:50] consequences so we should spend time
[25:53] reflecting in our life and how choosing
[25:55] to live with God's boundaries has
[25:57] protected you but also look at the times
[25:58] you willfully Step Beyond his umbrella
[26:01] of protection and had to endure the
[26:02] Fallout here's the thing about Sin the
[26:05] repercussions aren't always immediately
[26:07] evident sometimes we think we've gotten
[26:09] away with it but sin eventually demands
[26:11] our payment unless we each come to
[26:14] understand and this is important unless
[26:16] we each come to understand God loves me
[26:18] and I can trust him
[26:21] we will never walk through life
[26:23] dependent on the character of God to
[26:25] make the right choices
[26:27] I'm going to say it again I'm not you
[26:29] see this is before you can talk about
[26:31] dress you can talk about boundaries you
[26:33] can talk about rules all you want to but
[26:37] something has to drop deeper and this is
[26:39] what d That's what I said about David he
[26:42] said I love thy law
[26:45] David's not saying I have to do this
[26:48] he's saying I love it he come to a place
[26:51] I love it I love your precepts the more
[26:54] the more detail that God's made it for
[26:56] me the better I embrace it I love it I
[26:58] haven't I'm not bucking up against it
[27:01] when I read that quote of Moses when I
[27:04] read that quote of the Prophet Nathan
[27:06] when I read that thing I'm all over it
[27:09] I'm saying Lord you said that for a
[27:12] reason and I would never dump that out
[27:14] there's got to be a reason that you said
[27:16] it
[27:17] I love it because of this unless we come
[27:21] to understand that God loves me and I
[27:25] can trust him
[27:26] don't mess with God's boundaries
[27:31] don't mess with God's precepts it
[27:35] if God said it I believe it that settles
[27:38] it I love his law
[27:40] I love his word Lord I want you to know
[27:45] tonight I may not understand every
[27:47] detail of this word but I want him to
[27:49] know I love this word I trust this word
