========================================

i appreciate brother paul long time friend been a good many years amen ecclesiastes chapter nine 13 to verse 18. he said this wisdom have i seen also under the sun and it seemed great unto me there was a city and a few men within it and there came a great king against it and besieged it and built great bull works against it and that was found in a poor wise man and by his wisdom delivered the city yet no man remembereth that same poor man then he said i wisdom is better than strength nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised and his words are not heard the words of wise men are heard and quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools wisdom is better than weapons of war but one center destroys much good amen you must be seated i would like to uh uh give a title uh the pressures of a besiege the pressures of a besiege amen now the word besiege is a very interesting word and it got a lot of meanings to it and one that's interesting to me well which we know a besieged means a place with armed forces in order to capture it by force to surrender and lay a siege to it and it also means it also means surround with armed forces they say the army besieged the castle then it also means to press with a request it means that also so other words we can go through different scriptures in the bible and it gives different examples about a besiege and how things happen but the pressures i i want you to catch what i'm trying to minister this morning it's the pressure what a bc causes people to do and how it makes them act and sometimes people don't know how they realizing why they're acting certain way until they can just stop a moment and just stop just say hold on a minute because when things are happening rapidly in your life a lot of times we don't think we just act we just start moving and then coming to conclusions and all kinds of stuff and and then a lot of times it's wrong now uh in the besiege it's a terrible thing but i find in the bible the children of israel besieged people and also the people besieged them it depends on what happened and god uh allowed moses which we want to turn to deuteronomy 28 god allowed moses to write things about a besiege to the children of israel and it hasn't happened yet because in deuteronomy a lot of things that moses would tell them they haven't even done it yet but it's prophecy later on it actually happens so we're going to see in deuteronomy how that moses is going to begin to explain things about what the besieged do and then later on they actually start fulfilling those things now one thing about the siege when the enemy surrounds the city he he don't he he blocks every gate that's the purpose he don't want nothing coming in don't want nothing going out he blocks every gate that's the first thing he don't even throw a weapon he don't even use a weapon the main thing is to block the gates so what they'll do which the def one definition of that word is a seat means to sit there so what the enemy would do to the city he would just sit there while they're on the inside and his purpose is for them to run resources he wants them to run out of resources run out of food and then it makes his battle easy once he knows that they're got no more food and they don't done everything they can he just say all right guys let's just go ahead and take it over and then they're so weak they can't even fight back and then in many cases once they get so weak they just surrender because also in the besieged it means to press with requests in other words the enemy would be on the outside we have requests if you just surrender just surrender don't fight back just come on out to us and we want to be over you you'll be fine you see that's how the enemy is he does a lot of people like that see a lot of people give in to pressure they get tired they just say well i'm just tired then they just give up don't fight back no more that's exactly how the devil works he wants you to get tired you know parents sometimes get so tired battling with the children and they give up on the child then they let them just go do anything they want to do say i'm just tired just go just go then the devil won what he done he had besieged that parent sat there with pressure and then they just give up we don't supposed to give up there supposed to be no retreat no surrender can we say amen but that's what the enemy does now let me just read this the the prophet said in the message letting off the pressure he said i thought this and letting off this thing everybody is just becoming a neurotic age everybody is built up haven't got no time and that builds up to a place that it breaks up things you know i hear people always say it just ain't enough time in the day i'm sorry it's still 24 hours in the day time is still the same it's us don't got so busy to it seem like an eight months time but that clock's still gonna flip around 24 hours so you can't blame it on time but he says here that builds up to a place it breaks up things pressure breaks up things and those things you can put any title you want on it family friendship relationship homes churches it breaks up things it causes people to have hard feelings when they snap them off say things you don't mean to say that's what pressure does see when you don't know how to deal with pressure you're going to do things you regret it happens all the time so you have to learn how to deal with pressure and i'll tell you i don't been through a life of pressure and uh and i know i can't get away from it i learned how to deal with it because i know who i am i'm a son of god and i know it's for a reason now this is me and i always say this because people got their own ideas but this is me i don't never ask god why i just don't i don't i don't say why why are you doing this why i don't do that whenever i go through something i i just say what are you trying to show me i want to catch what he's trying to show me or what he's wanting me to see that's that's what i do because i know it's something he wants me to see yeah because wise can lead up to doubts i'm questioning god that's what it could lead to and he says now everybody he now he said now everybody is guilty of it i am guilty you're all guilty now this the prophet saying that we're all guilty amen i asked the church the other day i said how many of you ever been used by the devil raise your hand some of them didn't raise their hand i said you were just used by the devil dead because you didn't raise your hand amen because you know and people just don't don't want to be honest in these day and time i just like being honest honestly just honest you know praise the lord he says everybody is guilty i'm guilty you're all guilty we do things under pressure that we don't otherwise he said there's an excess pressure built up today i believe before i go any further i might say this i believe it's the enemy coming down and pressing i believe it's the devil see the closer we get to the rapture it'll be more pressure it will have to be that way because the devil uses these things to bring distractions to keep you from the right attractions that's that's what how the enemy operates he want to throw you all focus he want to throw you off balance but you know when it comes to the end of the day every individual will have to see them things in their own life it's easy to point out something in somebody else's life but i think we need to just consider and look at ourselves can we say amen that's just the way it should be he said we know the coming of the lord is at hand the bible said in the last days the devil would go about like a rowing lion and you think he and if he could get you under pressure hurrying running over something you will make decisions that you wouldn't make if you sit down and think it over can we say man how you ever have somebody get mad at you when they ask you something then you say wait a minute they said why are you taking your time we need to know now you need to do something now you don't have people do you like that they want to rush you see when people try to rush you they it's a good sign too that they unstable in their own life so now they want to put that pressure on you to make you make a quick hasty decision about things amen but we we shouldn't do those things but this is the pressure age that we in it could cause those things if we just don't stop for a moment and just think that's right now the pressures of a besiege we're going to get back to ecclesiastes in a moment now turn with me to deuteronomy chapter 28. i'm seeing pressure today on so many different levels in ministries one thing in ministry there's battles amongst ministers because somebody done said something about you you didn't like it or whatever the worst thing a minister could ever do is bring that to the pulpit and preach his personal battle to his congregation the worst thing you could ever do you know your pastor i knew he wouldn't well let me just use myself i can cause my church to get mad at somebody by the way i preach and then i could be the person that's wrong i can say i can talk to my church you know these brothers saying certain certain things about me and blah blah blah and the congregation go talk about my pastor make no sense but you really don't know what they said and you're already getting mad what they could be saying about me could be true but i'm projecting it to the congregation what they saying about me but it could be true what they're saying about me so when somebody tell me this one said this about me and this this this i say what did they say i don't be like whoa about you see when you get real close to friends and buddies and friendship you automatically get mad at whoever mad at your friend but that's not christianity i want to know what the facts are what is the truth because sometimes you know say well brother what are they saying about you i said tell me what they said about y'all i might not like you then just tell me what did they say and then everybody said well they said they said this this this did you do it well yeah i swear i feel the same way about you that they feel about you because what you did is wrong so i like to know what is it but we like to jump to conclusions on things because the association we have with the person the word of god don't work that way the word of god it fits every situation it is not prejudiced it means exactly what it says that's why when it comes to the word of god if you love god you're going to love god if he says something bad about you you're still going to love him a lot of people love the gospel as long as they're hearing things that they want to hear but when it comes to correction and rebuke that's when people really get offended that's when you really find out where their relationship really is with the lord god is never wrong he's always right can we say praise the lord so the bible is a prophecy the bible is a book of prophecy that's exactly what it is and everything is controlled by prophecy what has already been spoken is being refilled be fulfilled again that's why solomon said there's nothing new under the sun that's why we got all of this word we got the bible we got the message everything we need to know it lies in the bible this is our resources now in deuteronomy chapter 28 verse 1 it said it shall come to pass if thou hearken diligently unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe and do all his commandments which i command thee this day that the lord thy god would set thee on high above all the nations of the earth and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god you know when people don't understand the nature of god they miss they just can't misunderstand what god is saying god is not a god just want to say i want to bless you and curse you he just don't throw things out there god has a reason for everything that he says for instance uh you would find even in the book of deuteronomy i can't remember what chapter it is moses i think it's chapter 31 somewhere around now moses told the children of israel all these years god had you out here in the wilderness he said it's to prove you and to try you and to humble you so god allowed all these incidents now you go back and read that scripture he said you remember when the children of israel said they was hungry god knew they was going to be hungry because moses told them he suffered you to be hungry god let them be hungry just to see how they're going to respond and what they're going to do god was doing all of the testing so god let you and me literally go through things so he can see how you're going to respond and how you're going to react to it that's why i don't think it's strange when something happens god is testing you and me because he has to do that can we say amen testing trials is not to break us down it's actually the builders up if you look at it the right way so he said blessed shalt thou be in the city blessed shalt thou be in the field blessed shall i be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground fruited like cow on the increase of thy kind in the flocks of thy sheep god has given blessings and these blessings rely on keeping my commandments so he let them get hungry and then he fed them bread and so forth and fed the manna god done that for a reason but if you notice the key thing when he gave them the matter then he gave commandments you can only pick so much up for this day and then that's it then he's saying don't leave none for the next day he started giving that's see the manner was the food but his word was the commandments how to go get it when to go get it how much to go get it that's what the test was what's so much the food it was his word that's why the scripture said god was trying to show that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god see all of that was a test and it's the exact same thing today today god want to see god ain't worrying about the test god is a god is not afraid to put his saints in prison god got no problem put you in jail letting you go to jail he ain't got no problem with that he's well known for putting believers in some strange places because god is not worried about that situation he have that confidence in that believer they're going to keep my word can we say praise the lord he allowed paul i mean carnal minds say what kind of god is this put people in jail let them go to jail be such a loving god why are you going to let you go to jail why are you going to let you get sawed asunder if he's such a loving god what kind of god is this because god is not afraid to put his believers through trials he could have stopped him from going in the fiery furnace but he didn't he let him walk right in it but he was actually waiting in there for him so god is not afraid to let you go through trial really it's showing his confidence that he has in you job had no idea that god and the devil was talking to each other but joe was going through this pain but god was letting the devil know do whatever you want this is a good one here and joe didn't have a clue because if joe would have had a clue process lord why in the world you gonna let me go through this and you told the devil i was perfect god told the devil job is perfect then all right give me some trials and we say i want to be perfect i want to be mature trials come with that praise the lord let's jump down to verse 52. i'm cause if you have you have to read that whole chapter to catch what's going on but i want to jump to verse 52 because verse 52 we get to the place when god tell them when you don't keep my word this is what i'm gonna let the enemy do to you he gonna let them know if you don't keep my word the enemy is gonna be able to do this to you notice he says now this is what i want you to catch he said he shall be seized thee excuse me in all thy gates into the high high and fence wall come down wherein thou trusted now moses is talking to them but where are the fences where are the gates see the temple wasn't even built yet but god let them know this is going to come to pass this is what's going to happen to you if you don't keep my word see this is a prophecy now they probably like what are you talking about most fences and walls and gates what are you talking about you see in the bible when they build a city the first thing they build is the walls not the city they build the walls because the wall represents the protection that goes around it so that the enemy can't get in see so he's this is a prophecy and he says he shall besiege thee and all thy gates into the high and fenced walls come down worrying thou trusters he's saying worry and i trusted because long as they know them fences is out there and the enemy is out there they trusting in the wall that's all he ain't going to get over that wall we were in the bottom because he got to get over the wall but you remember never connecting them thought the exact same thing they was trusting in their walls the prophet god talked about but the enemy came up under the wall and that's how he got him so moses said you trusting in your walls and all this stuff is just like america what's she saying she trusted in the armed forces and all of these things she's relaxing oh you let ukraine try to come near us we now all of this is prophecy because what's going to happen to america is going to happen just like in the book of jeremiah jeremiah told them told the children of israel when the king of babylon come to you he's done him try to fight him is cause your weapons won't work it ain't gonna work even though you got good weapons they won't work because prophecy make them not work so god controls every thing so he let them know he shall besiege thee and all thy gates throughout all thy land with the lord thy god giveth thee now he's showing what the enemy is going to do notice all thy gates that means he's going to stand in front of every one of them so they can't get out and nothing can come in that's the tactic of the enemy but now what he's visiting to do now is start talking about the pressures because of you in the besiege what pressure is going to make you do now notice right here it's now i want y'all to think about this moses talking to people i know they think he's crazy because it didn't happen yet but it did happen later on look what he gonna say the pressure going to make you do verse 53 thou shalt eat the fruit of thy own body the flesh of thy sons and thy daughters with the lord that god hath given thee in the siege and in this straightness worth thy enemy shall be stretched deep now i'm pretty sure they said moses you you really don't lost it we're gonna eat our own children come on moses this is prophecy he said but this when the enemy sees you this is what you're going to end up doing you see we understand what happened even when titus we understand through history they did eat one another's children but these things happen in the bible times too so but that is not even humanly right where somebody would eat their own child but it happened because in that siege that pressure got so bad see what happened when the enemy was out there as long as they had some resources that's all we all good everything is fine but they kept eating and they kept eating and they kept eating you remember it just happened in the book of kings they got the they got to eating their horses and they started doing everything when the syrians had surrounded them exact same thing that happened but then when all of the resources started going out they were starving so bad and depression was so bad they looked at junior could you imagine the pressure on the parents husband and wife talking we starving well we got these kids here no no time go by we starving then all of a sudden which one of these children caused the most problem we'll take that one first now naturally we won't do that but pressure can be so bad spiritually you'll eat your children you start doing it spiritually eating one another causing pressure all right let me just keep going i want you to watch how i make people change listen to verse 56 the tender and the delicate woman among you which would not adventure to set the soul of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness her eye shall be evil towards her husband what this is talking about a humble sister quiet by nature y'all met people like that oh they're just so sweet and quiet just to be in their presence but the bible telling us that delicate tender sister pressure will make her change too sometimes as a pastor somebody might be like well you know that sister done such and such can you be like are we talking about the same sister yeah and yo she's so nice i i have to disagree i don't see that i don't see no but pressure pressure huh sometimes people be see when you don't act right around your children but you can only act right around adults and church people when somebody's giving you a compliment but your children really know how you live and it was like oh that precious brother he's just such a man of god and gender and kind and the family be like we looking at two different people it's that this sister this tender sister would make her look even at her own husband pressure make a change because the devil doesn't gotta seek somewhere in her life and he won't move now he's making her great character i know this ain't a popular sermon this morning i know you'd rather hear the seals or you'd rather hear the trumpets and all of these good things which is wonderful but you ain't got character that don't mean nothing it don't what that song you just saying religion doesn't work anymore but revelation does and character praise the lord amen notice it said her eye shall be evil towards the husband of her bosom towards her son towards her daughter now pressure in the sea caused individuals to attack their own family from within listen verse 57 toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet to other children which she shall bear for she shall eat them for want of things secretly in the siege and straightness wherein thy enemy shall distress thee and thy gates that's what when the devil to put a besiege around you he'll cause you to go against people speak think evil think bad and it all because the results of pressure that's why you have to take that time say wait a minute see i'm the type of person whenever i'm going through something i stay away from people because i don't want to offend nobody i go deal with me i have to deal with me my family we've been taught very well when i come home if something don't went wrong pressure when i walk in the door my wife can just look when she'll know she was just saying nothing and i just go through chain clothes turn around walk right back outside and i can walk around my yard and think just think man don't even say nothing go out there then come back then when i get the problem solved i go back in the house hey hey how you doing facebook because i don't dealt with me but today you're all right excuse me sir but that breaker cut that's what happens then start devouring it's something i say all the time in this message and it's come to family life and a lot of things we're all a bunch of historians we can always say you remember you did that you remember you said that you remember that you remember you remember you've been bringing up history that goes to show you really didn't forgive because when you really forgive something you're not going to bring it back up but that besiege that pressure can cause all of that he said thou would not observe to do all the words of the law that are written in this book that thou mayest fear the glorious and fearful name the lord thy god he just let him know when the enemy comes around you besiege you this is what you're going to do this is what's going to happen you see we're in satan's eden surrounded by a wall of laodicea and we're living in the midst of it but we got resources to feed from to eat from to keep us strong to be able to fight because the enemy want to keep you and get you to starve because once you starve and you ain't if you ain't studying fasting laying in this word of god i'm here to tell you you're going to be sticky you're going to be a fault finder you're going to be a blamer and you'll never look at yourself and the problem literally sometimes it's just you and me because when you look in the word of god and when you study the word of god god's going to show you up he'll show you your bad about you he'll show you the good about you that's the god that we have can we say amen turn me to first samuel chapter 23 ain't gonna be wrong brother paul this uh this pressure it just even when you could do good to someone pressure can cause them to even go against you yet you even done good if i can remember the scripture i want to show you something in the morning but i'll i'll keep thinking about it as we go but i want to go to in deuteronomy i mean first samuel 23 verse 1. watch this right here this is the time saul is chasing david trying to kill david and all so forth he said then they told david saying behold the philistines fight against cali and they rob the threshing floors saul will come on the scene later therefore david inquired of the lord saying shall i go and smite these philistines and the lord said unto david go and smite the philistines and save collide in other words it's not even david fight but he going down there and helped them in cali he asked him lord shall i go help him he's go go help him save him save him from the philistines and david man said unto him behold we'd be afraid here in judah how much more than if we come to calais against the armies of the philistines and david inquired the lord yet again and the lord answering to him said arise go down to kalau for i will deliver the philistines in thy hands that same god speaks today but we can just go to him as we would just listen say lord what do you want me to do i believe if we be patient enough he'll speak in here directly and tell you exactly what to do verse 5. david said so david and his men went to collab and fought with the philistine and brought away their cattle smoked them with the slaughter so david saved the inhabitants of kilau when it came to pass when a.b atha the son of emily fled to david to collab that he came down with an epar in his hand and it was told saul that david was come to callow and saul said god had delivered him in my hand for he is shut in by entering into a town that has gates and bars see saul knew once david is in there he can't come out it got bars around and now i got him but look how a religious evil spirit can talk about saying god did it saul got an evil spirit on him now he's saying the lord don't gave me david see when you're dealing with religious demons religious spirit they talk and say god said god said but yet they're just as wrong as they can be that's the deceitfulness of this age and he says here verse 9. no i'm sorry and salt verse 8 and saul called all the people together to war to go down to callow to besiege david and his men see they're going to be sieged again and david knew that saul secretly practiced mischief against him he said to abraham to the priest praying heather to the ephod then said david oh lord god of israel i like david's attitude he consulted god first what to do he shouldn't now if he would have been in that relationship with the lord like he should have done he would have done it with bathsheba see he didn't seek the lord because they were his own personal lusts something he wanted to do so a lot of times people say they don't seek god when they got something they already going to do it anyway they ain't going to seek the lord but we should seek him in all things amen i can feel my preacher coming on now notice what he says here verse 10 then said david oh lord god is your thy servant has certainly heard that saul seeketh to come to kalau to destroy the city for my sake he said will the man of color deliver me up in his hand will saul come down as thy servant hath heard oh lord god of israel i beseech thee tell thy servant and the lord said he will come down then david said david will the man the collage deliver me up and my man into the hand of saul and the lord said they will deliver thee up why david don't save them but now they hear saul is coming the pressure going to get on them they say david i'm sorry buddy you sure did help us out but there he is all he hiding right there pressure makes you turn on the people that even try to help you and we don't understand it's a time i just why what pressure don't hit them to them act that way can we say praise the lord i want to go back to ecclesiastes now chapter nine a lot of things happening now around the message it's a result of pressure people responding wrong way because of pressure especially when somebody feel like they when you know kind of touch their pride they really want to fight back and say things it shouldn't be that way can we say praise the lord that's why even even in family life you know a lot of times people tell me they say brother you just preach on family stuff too much you know i said what was wrong with that we're the family of god what's wrong with that because if you got towards homes you're going to have a tour of church because the strengths of the family is what make the church that's why you need some some sign you got some family struggling but they can see a family that's strong and really holding the line that'll influence them that's a good that that brings a good influence encouraging somebody else but if we're all tore up that's a pretty bad situation to be in can you say man let it be a situation like two drowning man asking each other for help and both of them drowning help me it won't work like that somebody got to stay above these things friends and i believe we as the bride of jesus christ don't get caught up into what's going on we get caught up in the words and now let me look differently let me think differently let me not get caught up into this because it's very easy to do i don't get caught up into the minister associations of the message today i don't get caught up with a certain group i like being independent i like being who i am i can go preach wherever i want to go preach or wherever i feel led by god grace that's when i if he tell me go preach for three people i can still go pray you know you got some preacher they don't really want to preach unless it's a special meeting if it ain't a special meeting you call and say hey brother i wonder what you doing this weekend i mean i can get you come by pre-trial oh is it a special meeting yeah every church service is a special meeting then let me know it's something in your ministry you need some dying you need god to kill you a little bit more that's right just think in the besiege they start eating one another and pressure causes people to do that rip each other down cuddy people just say all kind of bad things all because of pressure i was talking about paul you know it's people we're talking about the holy ghost there are some things that brother burnham said about the holy ghost don't do and if you really really want to get so so so technical what you say who got it right whoa whoa he started talking about one place and the message was the holy ghost and you hear these other people saying things about you and stuff like that he start talking about the holy ghost yeah you ain't gonna revile back you ain't gonna want to go go back at them but look at me to do that somebody say something about it oh i'm gonna say something get them back now if i want to take the quote say well according what prophets there you ain't got the holy ghost but i don't do that because i know we die daily we die as we grow that's correct but when you look at things a certain way you want to put somebody in your little circle in your little ball and they need to act the way you want them to act it don't work like that i want to i want to be just the way god wants me to be but the enemy when he's around them when he get a sense they don't run out of resources then they start knocking the gates down the man that can try to hold the gates but no strength the enemy just pushed the gate and they just fall back with it and the enemy just walks in and triumphs because nobody has no strength to fight because all of the resources are gone but it's that city when the enemy is out there if that city we had a secret resources and inside where they never went out the enemy could be out there thinking it's time to go get them now but didn't know it was a secret supplier in there when that enemy hit that gate and when he bounced in there guess what strong warriors are right there waiting on them and wear them out and be like retreat i thought they were starving i thought they were dead man they still strong they almost got something in there it's a hidden resource i'm here to tell you that's what the bride has she has a resource the word of god that never runs out and i want to show you where it comes from in ecclesiastes 9 this wisdom chapter 9 verse 13 what we read this wisdom have i seen under the sun and it seemed great unto me there was a little city few men within it and there came a great king against it and we seized it and built great bull works against it what this is talking about when the enemy besieged the city then he start building bull walks you know if you look at weaponry in the bible times they have big old weapons that throw stones that are not gates down they had big old logs where they could bump the gates so the enemy should be sitting out there building this billionaire getting all his weapons his battlements set up and they can look over the fence what are they doing no that this time you really didn't want the watchman telling you the truth to watch me say they building some big old great thing it from the looks of it guys it throw rocks they'd be like oh pulling the confidence down then they said watch me one of the night he gets up there it's some kind of spiky thing they got and it looked like it could really rip through a gate that's what i'm seeing guys oh but the watchman's got to report the truth got to report the truth that's what they do he sets around the city built great bull works against it getting all his weapons set up because he said this city is done i'm going to take over the inhabitants the city and all but what this this case while they was doing that it said verse 15. now that was found in it in the poor wise man he by his wisdom delivered the city yet no man remembered that same poor man whoever this wise man was how he delivered the city he didn't do it by weapons so in other words it was some words he was able to tell them to help them overcome what the enemy was trying to do this man here what i'm reading to you actually is this entire gospel let's look at it again verse 14 it said there was a little city i would like to put in there there was a little bride and they sent a few man within it fear not little flock a few in the bride and there came a great king and against it in this satan's eden and received it with facebook besieged it with the internet besieged it with tick tock but besieged it with instagram because that's what the best results in all of these things what the devil would have built around all of us to bring us into a besiege are you with me but notice verse 15 that was founded in a poor wise man from the hills of kentucky poor wise man weighing boring in the backside of kentucky in the log cabin wise but where did his wisdom come from listen to the scripture by his wisdom delivered the bride amen not his wisdom but the wisdom god gave him to deliver the bride god sent this message this is our resources regardless how much the devil don't created things or cause things if you keep feasting upon this word of god that besiege is not gonna make you devour somebody going to make you devour the enemy not your brother not your sister [Applause] but listen to what he says he said but no man remember that poor man's message anymore the very message god sent to deliver the bride now you got people want to go against the message but god sent it for deliverance they don't want to consult the message no more don't want nobody's talking about prophet no more no nobody want to say anything oh we don't we just need the bible now we don't need the message no more that's a lie we need both of them we need it all this message comes so god bride can become out of this besiege not let it influence you but you overcome it this is the pattern of today and it eat the fat we run out of resources we got all resources that's what the prophet god told the prophet start the food we got everything we need laying here but you got to eat it just so you can maintain strength for every war every battle that you faced verse 16 then said our wisdom is better than strength nevertheless the poor man's message is despised the message to many is despised too many they despised this message but yet at the time when they were believing it it was causing them to overcome but now because of personal things in their life they want to do and the word is contrary so now they got to despise the message to justify their own personal desire and his words are not heard isn't it a shame they don't got that bad today now i don't have to say brother branham said every time i quote something i have to do that if you study the message you're knowing somebody preaching the message it's bad the categories we get now if you don't say brother branham enough you're not preaching the message that's sad that's really really sad it really is i got no problems somebody saying brother banner said or the prophet said or they don't even say it at all they just keep they preach the real real word they don't bother me long as they're preaching the revealed word i'm good but then i don't want nobody to tell me i can't say his name i can't say the prophet that's not going to happen if i feel led to say it i'm going to say it if i feel it not to say it i'm not going to say it what does that matter long as the word is being preached the revelation that god hath gave him in this hour but all of these now because of pressure things been set in categories now who's really preaching the message and who's not really preaching the message and that is wrong like well i'm preaching now i'm not jumping i'm not screaming i'm not running but sometimes at my church you might think somebody don't pull gas on me lit me on fire you'll be screaming and kicking sometimes i preach just like that sometimes i don't i preach just like this then you get the other light he ain't lively today i'm just as live as i ever been you go by whatever god wants to do whatever god wants to say and you fall under that anointing right now i don't feel like jumping and kicking if i try to do it it won't work skipping y'all gonna be like is he mad cause he's not fitting the anointing what god want me to present this morning you have to be led by the spirit what to say when to say god how do you want me what you want me to do lord but now people want to predict the way a sermon or service should be no it shouldn't be like that friend it's whatever he wants to do i respect every ministry i don't categorize nobody i just respect every god call ministry because i want to because i know that it's a gift of god that is called to feed my soul i was sitting in the minister's meeting some people are saying sharp now you know oh that's good oh yeah i think one brother said one simple thing like a bomb explode he just raised his hand said a few things it was good whoa he didn't even raise his voice so you got to get caught up in not our own spirit get caught up in the holy spirit i never forget many times when i didn't have the message on tape just reading books sometimes you can read a book you start just coming out of your cloak look at what he's saying then when you finally get the tape would have been ain't even screaming and you like whoa whoa so you don't assume he was jumping and kicking but he is all right what is the anointing the anointing is to know what to say and when to say it that's a quote praise the lord brother brandon said the greatest anointing that was on any human being it was the lord jesus christ he said when he took the book he found a place written of him he said then when he read it he sat down he said that was the greatest anointing of any human being so the anointing is it's not something outwardly it's something that's lined up with the authority of god and it falls right in the channel the way god said because you know you can say one word it could mean more than saying a thousand words you can just say one so the pressures today brothers and sisters let us just think about our ways do like david as i sat and i thought upon my ways then he said i turned my feet into thy testimonies could i guarantee you when you yourself is under a lot of pressure whoever you around if you are careful you'll influence them and your pressure will fall on them and they'll start taking your thoughts and i always take that back to saul when saul was chasing david the army of god was chasing david and they didn't know why they was chasing david because they had fell upon the saw spirit trying to kill david but then the bible said when saul died when saul died the very one that was trying to chase david down now they come back to david after saul died and then they told david you were the one that led us in and out in the beginning then the same man that was trying to kill him now they telling david that why could they tell david that now because the anointing the influence that it was only was now broken now they can see david for who he was to go study the message one man's influence into another them things are true the prophet bring things out falling upon the different people's influences i want to be influenced by the holy spirit that's what i want to be influenced by and the beautiful thing about that story when there was undersaw fighting with him fighting for him all of those damn things you got to go all the way back to uh joshua each one of those tribes had gotten their inheritance they had gotten their position they had gotten their place in the land each one of them established but when they asked for a king fell upon the saul's anointing that's what messed them up that's what messed them up because all of that fighting they was doing was not for the lord they were doing it for saul because all used them and then david anointed to be the king one thing when god anoints something or have a position for you something for you to do in your life you don't have to prove it you don't have to fight for a position god will make sure you get it david knew the throne belonged to him but he never fought for it even when his sons wanted he didn't fight for it because he knew if god said it i supposed to be the king he said it through that prophet if god said god will bring that to pass and look what david went through one thing about david yes he was knowing it to be the king but he wasn't knowing it to sit on the throne no i mean he didn't he was anointed to be the king but he didn't had a character to sit on the throne that's why he went through all that with saul and everything prepare him for the throne that's why when god got something ordained for your life he gonna take you through all sorts of things in life to prepare you for it instead of just putting you there he's going to prepare you for it and when he when he takes you through them things and then you're ready he said this is my son this is my daughter now the character fits or the predestinated calling that i have for that's how god do things and what's so beautiful they would saw trying to kill david but when saul died david took those same men took their gifts the bible said all of them came to david and the bible said they came to make david king when saul died all those gifts came together to make david king see the administration had to change see that's what this message is all about to take us from under a denominational influence see what david did when they came back under david it put all the gifts in the right place and they fought to make david king that's what the message came from because in the denominations in the pentecostal them was true gifts of god but they was killing the cause of christ bringing a reproach to the gospel so when god put us up under this administration of malachi 4 same gifts but it took them to give god the glory that's why any minister i don't care who he is if he's preaching to lift up himself something is wrong we should preach christ so that people can feel closer be drawn closer to the lord and farther away from themselves i like what the prophet of god said in the message what is the holy ghost he said whatever he was telling people how to receive the holy ghost hang around and stay around and then he said however long it takes for you to die just stay around so you can get the holy ghost and today people just don't want to die to them saying oh i die daily friend i get rebuked sometimes he says how do you know god loves you i said oh oh i know he loves me is how do you know i said man he whips me so bad he tears me up when i think wrong he convicts me oh man he just really beats me pretty good he said what i said yeah that's how i know he loves me what son of mine that i have i don't chase it and it's love god bless you i'm a god bless you it's a lot to be saved but i think i don't say it enough because my heart is burdened on so many things that happen today but it's a simple solution stop and check yourself check yourself pressure upon our young people to fit into a crowd want to be with this little group pressure then drop standard just to fit in no this will be siege that's a besieged can we say amen and i have to deal with these things myself you know my own church and uh it's just a lot of pressure coming from every hand i'll tell you you remember when they asked the prophet to say do you is tv a curse he replied back he said i'll agree with you he said but it's what the person do with it he said it could have been a blessing so all these things facebook and these things can be blessings can be cursed it depends who the individual is what they're doing with it and then you get some preachers they pretty much put you in hell if you're on facebook i don't do that but i will challenge the individual what are you doing with it what are you watching how far are you doing with this stuff is it pulling you let me tell you something friend every time you wake up in the morning and you reach over the first time you grab is your phone something wrong facebook good morning facebook then at nighttime good night facebook fam that facebook become your family your church your minister that's addiction sorry oh yeah it's an addiction games are addictions people get attitudes when they play games playing your little game on your phone somebody say something to you what send me that that's a spirit man that's a spirit and they could have something very very important to tell you but your game to get to another level in your game is more important than that and the hurt that it brings to children wait child walk away then when they get a little game he said hey hey guys let's go outside i'm gonna play my game put that game down you're gonna spend time with the family right now put it down but you get away that's parent abuse that's what it is parent abuse oh okay praise the lord you reap what you sow then when your children get big move out get married you call them hey uh mama can i call you back uh something wrong i just got to call you back mama okay you hang up mama go they do to you what you did they did then three hours passed they finished their game they called you back mom what the what you wanted never mind now all this stuff consumes our time and then we gotta find time to pray i don't know what's wrong with people when they come to you and say i really need you to pray for me and uh it's uh it's pretty rough they just want you to pray but when you start trying to analyze the problem they get mad what's going on well this this what happened so uh you've been studying and praying and how much that's how much it's not not much you've been so busy ain't had time to do that so well that's your problem you ain't even praying for yourself you want me to wait for magic one to fix your problem now when you're the problem i got to say this you know in family life children especially when you got two three kids when they get older one of them might lose fellowship with mom and dad and they know it they don't make them mad they know they can't ask them for nothing they know that because they know they can't you know what they do like they'll find a favorite child i say go ask dad can we go sleep somewhere so okay because they know they ain't got fellowship with mom and dad they won't do it so they'll get another sibling to do it because they know there's no fellowship that's why sometimes when people ask me to pray for them i i find out why because a lot of times they don't lost fellowship with the lord and they see you still in fellowship here and they want you would you intercede for me we're supposed to be the interceders it's exactly right you looking interesting like the prophet god let's look at type in speaking conditions he mentioned a couple of times he's when when you go to the lord if you in speaking conditions with him in other words no condemnation in your heart you know you can go straight to him because god want to talk to you he want to listen but you can't go to him in any kind of way you just can't do it that's why the first thing we need to do when we approach the lord if there's something you ought to fellowship with him you need to start with repentance father forgive me i need to talk lord i don't do this i've been this i've been thinking this lord i don't like it it's not me i need to talk then you'll feel his presence start coming he said now we can talk but are you doing all kind of things lord i need you to listen i got a situation i need you to take care of me he don't even hear it but that's why people treat you we can't treat god like an errand boy we have to approach him the right way can we say praise the lord i better quit uh god bless you but this is what was on my heart this morning because pressure is on every hand but we got to know how to let off that pressure and sometimes it takes a moment just to stop say lord help me i need to talk amen my uh even my son who's your marriage i know he's on a lot of pressure sometimes here's another thing people can be so under pressure so bad but try to get you to think they're not you can just see through that they try to cite their mind of everything is okay you could just see through it i listen to my son say the thing cause he got to make some decisions oh i'm good i figure it out yeah i'm good at it man i'm just saying all he needs to do is say dad i need help but you know what i have to do just let it keep dragging on till he can get to the place real life hey hey pop i need it can you do something for me all right don't don't don't don't you know i don't like people to you know sometimes people like to throw things at you to get you to guess what they want you to they trying to say to you i don't like that tell me hello just tell me let's get down to the nitty-gritty what's the problem family life husband but let's get to it so tell me wow she he well he hasn't who about you what about you what about you brother how you treating your life or do you feel you got some kind of uh high calling you deserve higher than her i see all of one hello you're one you work together in a marriage if you can't work together they're gonna eventually split you gotta work together and that togetherness is not your mind only where y'all come together you often have the same mind going in the same direction can we say man for the right cause the selfishness today ruins marriages because one got a goal our own personal goal and this one got a personal goal it won't work but isn't it beautiful when they can talk about their goals and they help each other with the goal working together that's beautiful because it's all it's the so we can stable lives to family we want our children to be stable that's what it should be but that selfishness and i see it a lot and it ruined marriages it's bad amen god bless you let's get the lord bless you for fine
