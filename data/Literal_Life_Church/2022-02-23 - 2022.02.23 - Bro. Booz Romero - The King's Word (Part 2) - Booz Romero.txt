========================================

never will kind of the lord kind of will never be caught caught as a surprise amen um but we're we're again it is good to be in the house of the lord and um we're just trying to open my file here but it seems that it doesn't want to open or something happen but let me see if i can try it up there you go it's here you know you have your notes and everything is written in there and then all of a sudden something happens and nothing is coming up but you know praise the lord amen so um you know um what we can say tonight is you know the word of god is so perfect that a human cannot understand how the lord inspire all those books without having a contradiction against each other you know uh as we mentioned last last wednesday you know we were talking about 12 gates and then the prophet of god taught us that 12 is a number of foundations it's a number of kind of establishing something it's a number of uh you know when you're going to build a house you need good foundations say man and then through the bible we see that there there were the 12 children of israel you know there was the the establishment for for the jewish nation and then there were two apostles so that was establishment for for the gospel that needed to come every and everything was coming you know in number 12. then if you also go in reading the book of uh in uh at the beginning of the bible when they were um crossing the jordan river like there was uh uh joshua was telling them that they needed to set uh um uh like like a memorial and in that memorial there were 12 stones as well so what is all this talking about that the lord kind of he doesn't make mistakes and what whatever the lord does in our lives or whatever the lord has written in the scriptures is perfect so now when we look at this city when we look that there is a new jerusalem that is coming that has descended john is seeing a perfect city as we were saying last west last last wednesday uh john was seeing a perfect city with per with beautiful colors stones and everything and then he saw that it was 12 12 gates and then in on each a gate there were 12 a angel see man so that's why if somebody tells me that the bible is is not it's not the word of god or or if that it is not perfect i will tell them i i beg your pardon you're wrong because go back and read the scriptures and you'll see that christ is in the in his word amen so before we go there um you know the prophet of god uh he went up to one one time he was uh went up to the mountain and and you know he knew he knew everything he knew when how to go and go hunting and everything but there was this one specific uh instance that he went up to the mountain and and then when he was there like all of a sudden there was this a heavy fog that kind of fell on that mountain so all of a sudden he was like well i know my way back home he was so sure that he knew his way back home so there was maybe a little bit of something that he needed to check in his heart and that was the gate of humility amen so he he was like you know i know my way back home and i know how to uh i i know how to hunt and i know that i just take the way back and i'm gonna be i'm gonna make it back but then all of a sudden like uh he has started you know going in circles and going in circles and the indians will indians will call that the indian march in other words you start here and then you go go around and you go you're gonna get to the same place so it was the prophet of god you know he he was someone that was very close to the lord and then all of a sudden he was like i know the way you know i was reading he was like yeah i know the way i know the way i know the way but the more we bring ourselves first the more we're going to get lost that's why the the the the importance of recognizing when we are making mistakes lord i'm wrong and you're right please come in correct amen so there was like going in circles circle circles and circles and then all of a sudden he remembered you know a few uh or he was thinking before you know as i'm here i can i can survive like i know everything but i he he was thinking about his wife thinking about his son and then he was like but i know that they may die because they don't know they don't know how to hunt or they don't know how how to uh things like that like the survival things but then uh he was worried about it he was like so now what what is going to happen what am i gonna do if if i don't go down they're gonna die but then all of a sudden you know there there was a a a point or an instance where he realized you know lord then he he was having that specific thought god is my present help in the time of trouble god is my present help in the time of trouble and it was that was just coming to his mind coming to his mind coming to his mind and then all of a sudden he's like you lord you are my present help in the time of trouble so when he realized that he was wrong is when the lord can come and help him so that's the same thing for us you know talking about all these gates and things is like when we realize that it should be less of us and more of him then is when we are going to be helped so all of a sudden then he realized you know or he remember that film like in the summer of that specific year he had helped a yeah you know kind of to install some telephone wire so he knew that if he will find that telephone wire that means that he could go back home and then all of a sudden he just lift up his hands and said you know what lord i surrender lord this gate i can put it there this gate of humility now i'm checking it and i'm thinking i'm lacking there some lore so all of a sudden then he lifts up his hands and then he realized you know lord if i find that telephone wire i know that this is gonna be my way back home so once he found it then he's like i'm not gonna let this go because i know sorry all of a sudden he found that line that or that telephone wire that was gonna bring him back home so then he said you know what this is my time i can go now back home so how much more for us tonight that when we surrender to christ and when we lift up our hands and say lord my humility my testimony my salvation your word that needs to dwell in me lord i need your help i surrender tonight because i know that the the more that i surrender the more as the song says the more you're gonna take control of my life and the more i'm gonna see results in my life the more i'm gonna see changes in my life i was thinking you know if we go here you know we have this sorry we have this ship gate the fish gate the old gate the valley gate the dung gate and then we stop in the fountain gate so these are kind of a lot of people they stay there a lot of people stay in salvation a lot of people say and i just have to testify a lot of people they just say in in in their own experience a lot of people stay in humility a lot of people are staying the dong gate and a lot of people stay in the fountain gate but there's more there's there are more things that the lord wants to come and restore there are more things that the lord had already paid a ransom for you amen so that's why you know when when we surrender it's not going to be just six it's not gonna be your seven or ten or or eleven it's gonna be twelve the lord is going to build a foundation in your life but you need to go back and repair everything as we were saying last wednesday nehemiah had a heart had a desire in his heart that he wanted to see that city he wanted to see that wall repair he wanted to see the gates he wanted to see the locks he wanted to see everything repair and when there is a desire when somebody has a desire to repair something if it is a desire that is coming from the presence of the presence of god he is going to provide all the materials and and learn this tonight he's going to provide everything he's going to give you all the provisions that you need to all be an overcomer everything you're not going to be a survivor every day now you're going to be a victor it is time for us to change our attitude that we come to church or that we live our day by day as survivors the lord has provided us tools that we can be overcomers every day that when somebody tells us how are you doing you say i'm doing great by by god's grace when they asked that that woman how is everything going and she was like everything is fine and she had a son that was laying dead in her house but her faith was looking beyond death her face was looking beyond what human side can see her face was looking at the promise that her face was looking at the word that that prophet had a prophet elijah had and he had a word of restoration he had a word of resurrection we have received the same thing and we can live victorious lives tonight how many believe that amen so we just don't want to stay here and and what's the reason that we put these like like kind of arrows going around because this is a cycle these are things that you have to be checking in your life every day lord where am i in my humility where am i am i taking off all the trash out of my mind every day because remember the don gate he was like the dog would have to go through there but he didn't have to stay there he had to go through by that gate but then they it had to keep going onward to where it was supposed to be placed amen now the next gate that we have here is the water gate what is the water gate it's moreover the methane dwalt in office onto the place over against the water gate toward the east and the tower that laid out what is this these gates represent the revelation of his word and how it is how important it is the revelation that can never be over emphasized you know the fountain gate will always lead you to the watergate the holy spirit will always bring bring you to the revelation of the word because when you receive the holy spirit it cannot say something against on of what was already written in this book that's the revelation of his word the bible says that without faith it is impossible to please god and we can say without revelation it is impossible to please god and i can tell you ask the lord to show himself more and more through the revelation of his word that's why somebody asked the prophet of god you tell me how can i be closer to christ and the answer was not you you don't have to push play or he didn't say you have to push play and obey no you say read your bible and pray why because the more you read the more god is going to open his word we believe we say that we're bible believers if i ask you today did you take your bible and read something from there look what the prophet of god says the bible has the answer because the bible is the revelation of jesus christ being revealed since the foundation of the world he has been rebuilt he has been revealed in the form of prophets he has been revealed in the form of kings he has been revealed in the form of law givers because that's what he is he's a king he's a prophet and he's a law and he is god he is the same yesterday today and forever christ is the mystery of god that has been revealed to us in our day this is not a god of history that we kind of just look back at the god of story you know this is a god of a present time amen what is this why because the bible plainly declares his full coming and he comes in full revelation of the word and each generation reveals him in the full revelation that is loaded for that time but this then generation must reveal jesus christ if you're here because you are here you have to reveal jesus christ what does he mean to you tonight if he means something what does he mean to you this generation that's the revelation of him that has promised in the world it must be revealed to this generation there won't be any other generation this is a generation that is that you'll be seeing a changing in their bodies and i can tell you i'm a witness of that the lord have come and changed my mind the lord had come and changed the way i think the lord have come and changed the way i approach things isn't that something related to the changing of my mind in my body sometimes we go like so in the future that we say you know what then my my athletes are gonna be changed that's true that is coming but what change is lord doing in your life tonight if nothing is happening in your life i invite you to say lord something needs to happen in my life tonight i cannot stay like this anymore i cannot be living in sin anymore like this it has to be a cry in your heart lord i want to rebuild i want to be someone that you can use a revelation of who you are amen john said because god is able to these stones of these stones to raise to raise children unto abraham don't think that to say that within yourself we have abraham to our father but god is able of these stones to to raise children to abraham how many how many had a sonny heart and the lord has raised them tonight that's that's a fulfillment of that scripture of that when jesus was telling those people colossians 1 26 and 27 it says even the mystery and that's the beauty of the of the gospel is very simple yet is very deep even the mystery which have been hit from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints what is this to whom god will make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory churches that you say with god the father the dispensation as a father that's great or people stay with god emmanuel jesus with us or christ with us but i thought i like that but i want more lord what is your desire lord i want you you are the hope of my my life you are the hope of glory lord that's what i want tonight christ in you the hope of glory everything as we we always quote that quote from brother branham that says everything that was in the father was poured to jesus and everything that was in christ now where is it then we have to bring fruits of that amen how many has that desire in their hearts you can say lord that's what i want for my life prophet of god says let the bible read us here tonight see the truth let them see the malachi 4. what is malachi 4 that this is and this is that this anointing is supposed to come and he's supposed to restore back again that faith that the fathers once sinned the revelation of god in christ that's what he wants for my life may they see the revelation of god in human beings not just letter not how much you can read not how much you can't you can talk but may they see christ through your life christ manifested in the flesh of his church walking among us that's a prayer he's a granted lord how many say yes lord that's what i want for my life i want to manifest who you are now just the asberry paul was preaching not just the the legal lesson or idolatry no no we can take those two and they can they can come to a balance and then that's christ what kind of a revelation would that be it would be the revelation of his living after being crucified for 1900 years and he's raised from the dead and is alive with us he will be revealed i think he says the word don't need any interpretation when it is doing it itself revealing christ in the promise of the age that's exactly what will come on the sin is he is it here or not is christ being revealed himself through us or not is christ in me the hope of glory or not this gate is revelation of who christ is but more than that is who am i in christ you know in nehemiah chapter 8 verse 8 it says so they read in the book in the law of god distinctly and gave the sense and caused them to understand the reading what happened why were they able to understand the reading because everything was ready everything was repaired so they were able to understand what was written in the book of the uh of the law of moses because before that kind of it would have brought condemnation instead of conviction to this to their hearts and all the people went their way to eat and drink and to send portions and to make a great mirth and that's make great joy make up a fist why because the world was open to them how much more now that the world has been open to you tonight that you that's why why am i gonna be oppressed because of the attacks of the enemy when the world has been open to me and whatever come comes my way i know that the lord is going to take care of it and even more listen to this because they had understood the words that were declared unto them because will it be fair that you would be reading something and wouldn't be understanding a word it wouldn't be fair but once they received the word once they knew that everything was in its place then when they started reading the book when they were reading from an open book what happened they were rejoicing because now they were able their eyes were open they were able to understand everything and it is not just to have an intellectual understanding because a lot of people stay there oh this is that i can bring it down now to my heart lord how am i gonna express yourself today the opening of the word will place a desire in the people to say amen to the word and to worship god the opening of the word will place you in your position as what as a believer one more thing the opening of the word will show you where you come from the opening of the word will show you who you are the opening of the word will show you what is your purpose on earth and even something greater than that not just that but the opening of the word also will show you where you are going that's why you need to read your bible you need to listen to the tapes you need to come to church if you want to understand where you're going if you want to understand what's my purpose here what am i doing here am i just here just a church goer no lord i want i want to understand where i come from i and then the prophet of god says that we come from the mind of god it says you know does it the thoughts of god are eternal and they are real in other words this is not something that just happened out of the blue as we say this is then the prophet of god says they are not simply like a man without a blueprint that he has grown up in which one day will be translated into into substance and form no they are very already real and they are eternal and they are part of god and who are those that are already eternal and they are part of god where do i come from who am i what is my purpose here then it will show me show you where you're going so where are you going tonight i can say reveal yourself more and more every day lord may people can see that you are living in an earthly vessel isn't that your desire that when people see they can see like christ is walking there like that person has a different anointing that that person has something different wouldn't that be your desire tonight to say lord i want that i want that people when they they can come and approach me without being afraid that i'm going to give them a bad response or i'm going to be all grumpy amen but the lord doesn't just leave us there then after the watergate there is something more there is more in the word of god then now he brings us to the horse gate what is this nehemiah 3 28 from above the horse gate repair the priest every everyone over against his house and in the book of job chapter 39 verse 19 ins it says has thou given the horse strength has outlawed his neck with thunder what is a horse in the scriptures it represents a power it is a beast it represents a power in this gate it represents the quickening power that word that you receive that revelation that you receive is not it is you know you can receive a seed but if that seed is not quickened it wouldn't do anything but that seed needs to be quickened that seed needs to be revived that seed needs to receive the light amen is the mechanics and the dynamics in you enoch's mechanics became his dynamics what is your mechanics and your dynamics today you know the prophet of god says he was not only the mechanics but god's word he was the dynamics to prove that he was the mechanics then the the the he will do those the natural things but he also was the human part and he also was the divine part so that has to be the same thing has to be in us that that is the horse gate that's the quickening power in our lives and he you know the bride has to comfort because it is part of him in other words it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others has spoken of the bride the bride cannot produce something different than what he is because if that is then the bride is not part of him and i like this party look what it says here she is flesh of his flesh bone of his phones life of his life power of his power and even more than that she is him so if you are god if you are part of god tonight how are you supposed to live how are you supposed to conduct yourself are you going to be just like you know tired and just kicking the the can and uh just another day or will you be like you know lord whatever comes my way like i'm in your hands i know i know where you have brought me from i know what what purpose i'm fulfilling here lord if it is a purpose that you want do you wanna heal me then i'm gonna i'm fulfilling the purpose that you are the healer if i'm in need lord i'm fulfilling the purpose that you are the provider when we just complain you will say well brother boaz is because you are not going through things so if you will ask me are you going through things yes i am but we are not going to be oppressed by the enemy's attacks we cannot be like that all our lives we i posted something and i was very interesting you know brother paul was reading a quote from corey tem tim boom or whatever so she was saying like the worry will uh kind of draws or will kind of take the strength from your from the day isn't that right it can sorry the word god will take away the strength of the day but like why why wouldn't you enjoy your day today amen what is the quickening power what is that quickening power doing in my life when the word is being preached it is a word preaching to the word because there if there is a seed in your heart then that word has to say amen to that word amen the very dynamics of his word that is still a small voice that was inside of elijah or that came to elijah you know the seed must wait for the appointed time what was and i was talking to the youth on friday what was i still a small voice and when it came to elijah it was not a it came like an earthquake an earthquake came and god wasn't there and then the whirlwind came and god wasn't there and then why when that still small voice came to elijah why he was able to recognize that and i was telling the youth you know because when somebody is whispering to you that doesn't mean that that person is meters or a feet away from you that means that person is right next to you so that is what was happening with elijah he was able to recognize the lord's voice because the lord was right besides him beside him so when you're able to hear the voice of god be take heart and be confident that he's just right right beside you he is right he's right beside you seek him with all your heart and mind daily the prophet of god says if you want to hear from god what do you have to do you have to read your bible you have he says if you want to hear the voice of god you have to be in the word people is like it's because god is has forsaken me no the lord has not forsaken you is because you have drifted away from him romans 8 11 it says and if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the deal from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead he shall also quicken your moral bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you in other words for you in order for you to be quick and there has to be something in you that need that is supposed to be quick and that's the gate of the quickening power so that's why everyday lord is that quickening power in my life is your holy spirit in my life so that when you come and talk to me i'm a receptor of what you're saying amen after that weekend in power is in you now he brings us to another gate gate fish gate all gate valley gate long gate fountain gate watergate horse game we're gonna end soon here okay now he brings us to the easter gate what is the easter gate after after them prepare sadok the sum of emir over against his house after him repair also shemaya the son of shen shanaya the keeper of the east gate so they went and repaired the escape what is east gate or the easter gate this gate is the revelation of his coming why because matthew 24 27 it says for as lightning cometh out of the east and shine it even on to the west so shall also be so social out so the coming of the son of man be there it is that's why and if you go to like the ones that were in israel they are waiting for their messiah to come through a gate and i was reading specifically that gate that when uh they they kind of occupy the city kind of the other nations they block the gate because they were like if their messiah is coming there is a prophecy that has to be fulfilled so we don't want the prophecy to be fulfilled but guess what that prophet is prophecy is going to be fulfilled because he's coming through the eastern easter gate and for us what is this this is the revelation of his coming many times we speak about the seals and what is this at the end you know the seventh seal is bringing christ down to earth that is what the seventh seal is because when there was when the opening of the seven seal happened there was silence in heaven all the worship they stopped in heaven and why did either stop in heaven if it is stopping in heaven then where is christ where is christ now he was descending and i can tell you we're not longer waiting for for he he's coming for sure he's coming in a physical way but we have seen his appearing 1963 he descended that's what we have this picture that's what happened there but we're waiting to leave these dimensions because god is already here that's what we're saying that he is not like he's good that he's above us he's good that he's with us but i want him to beat me and if he is in me what does that mean that he is already here isn't that simple then the prophet in the message the rapture he says but to the church the bride the rapture is a revelation to her it has to be revealed to her in other words a personal revelation of his coming is found at this gate remember the rapture is a revelation to the heart of the believer you must repair and open this gate so you can see his coming amen now we go to another gate number 10. so he come through the east gate that's the revelation of his coming and then now we go to the mythcat gate after him prepare malka malkaya the goldsmith song onto the place of the nephilims and of the merchants over against the gate mythcat and to the going up of the corner in other versions and i think it's verse 2 32 it's talking about that he is going not not going up to the corner but he's talking about an upper room i don't know why he's there but he was there amen so this is the inspection gate this is the verification gate this is the gate of the appointed time this is the gate of adoption time amen and i was reading about this gate and this is the gate that led to the mount of olives what happened in the mount of olives is where gethsemane was and is also jesus he had to come to the mount of through this gate and then when he goes to the mount of olives you know he was very in gethsemane before before he went uh to the cross and also what in the book of acts it talks that he went back to these uh to to get to the mount of olives so he had to go through this gate in other words he had to be verified he had to be tested to make sure that he was the christ that his will was broken when he said father let not my will be but that will be done in other words when he was verified he was found perfect that's why every time you can go back to this gate lord a verification time it's a testing time his adoption time is a it's a it's an appointed time now notice here when jesus was baptized matthew 3 17 it says in law a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased that's it but now after this was brother i was preaching on sunday when adoption time came and jesus transfigured himself before peter james and john three words were added i'm not only dwelling in him but now he says well yeah well he had spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased he repeats the same words but he doesn't stay there he's like hear ye him there was a change in dispensation now you can hear him because he's an adopted son amen the son and we can say this the son in nothing differs from his master until they appoint it appointed time what was in this instance it was the appointed time to christ to show himself to them that it was not only the prophets or not only the law moses it was not only elijah the prophet no it was our everything about him everything about jesus and now he's telling us hear he him in other words now he is an adopted son galatians 4 1. now i say that the heir as long as he is a child deferred nothing from a servant though he be lord of all but he's under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father that's what we were saying like there has to be a gate where somebody has to be appointed where somebody has to be adopted even so when we were children we were in bondage under the elements of he of the world but when the fullness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that where under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because we are sons god has sent for the spirit of his son on into your hearts crying father father abba father that's us now he's sent he's telling us that when we go through this gate we are going to be adopted and are we in an adoption process yes we are so every day we can go and say lord how is my my adoption gate going verification time when when the tutor will come and check the sun and they're like you know what [Music] his thoughts today were not the best you know he just say a white lie today brother paul said one time he's like he just cheated on his taxes this year give to caesar what is to caesar it's an adoption time it's an appointment appointed time what is unappointed time is like a specific date a specific hour that is that option when they somebody's going to be adopted they said the court day and and that child is looking forward for that adoption because he's like you know that this day this hour this is in this specific location i'm gonna be receiving a name that's in the natural how much more us he's given us his word that now we have received we are in that appointed time in the days of the voice of the seven angel but he didn't stay there now he's like prophesying and speak again john who is he talking there about and he's now he's talking about us that's the appointed time for us i will say now you have to go and take the book and read the book it will be sweet in your mouth but then it's going to be bitter in your belly but if it is bitter it's going to bring good things amen an appointed time now you can say father father now you're not that far from me because your your third or your holy spirit now is checking my heart and now he can give a testimony today he obey your word today he went to church today he had a good heart do your work today he was able to produce the fruits that you want him to produce amen and i like this quote from from the prophet possessing the enemy's gates it says was only a few years later when the trials come and the church got all shook up and it's so easy for a congregation of people to do when something something doesn't seem to happen the way that it is supposed to be but god makes it that way god brings tensions into the church every son that cometh to god must be tried and proven and tested he let sickness strikes you he lets diseases come in you to test you and to prove you to show the world that you are truly the seed of abraham i lord i that sounds i ouch but a mentally work but he permitted by his own will he permits disasters how many have experienced at disasters and thanks lord at work at home in the kids school he permits the friends to turn against you he permits all these things and turns the devil loose to tempt you and he will do all but take your life he can do everything but he cannot take your life that's what he told satan when satan was before before him he's like you give him everything he has everything but he said well just you can take everything but you cannot touch the his life you cannot touch the wine you cannot touch the oil he could turn your he will throw you on a bit of affliction he will turn your neighbors against you he could turn your church the church against you he can do most most anything and it is god's will for him to do it but we are thought that it is more precious than gold to us in if we can say it this way what's going on what's happening here he's letting these trials is this these uh uh beating if we can say that way why because he wants to see where we are standing he wants to see how we are going to react and when you react the right way gets the i can say i can say that there is victory and i have experienced that not long ago i was talking to brother brandon about it there was victory there and i can say that i was going through that inspection gate and i pass he will allow us to go through situations to show that we are gold but i can say oh lord as many times i have to as i have to be inspected pass me by the filter of your word that's what we need every day pass yourself through the filter of the word if you're if you are lacking something you say lord help me help me help me go back lord help me go back in and restore the things that needs to be that needs to be restored then the baptism of the holy spirit will always open a way you know when you receive the holy spirit it does we wouldn't say just like that you have to encounter you have to meet the very person of jesus christ what is next after we go we're going through that verification gate now we're going through something else now we've got we're going through the efrain gate what is this so the people went forth and brought them and made themselves boots and every one upon the roof of his house and in the courts and in the courts of the house of god and in the street of the watergate and in the street of the gate of ephraim what is this this is the gate of double portion this is the gate of double fruitfulness after you have been adopted you are given the birth right amen as we're talking that child when he goes to the courthouse after he he he he came out without a name but when he goes out and you know he belongs to the state but after he's adopted now the child has a name now the child has a family and the scripture says that we have received his name and is as the the the name that is above all names and that all the families of this earth can receive that name and that is the name that is above all names the name of our lord jesus christ so this is where you are receiving a double portion look at what caleb said he says caleb was a faithful dog and he was a gentile he had a different spirit he wasn't looking at the problems he was looking at the promise and he was like you know what give me my mountain i i i my strength you know i was 40 days 40 years old and that was my strength but now i'm 80 and i have the same strength i have the same willingness to keep serving the lord now look at elijah he got a local portion why why elijah got out of the whole portion he told elijah you i want a double portion of your spirit and elijah told him if you see me when i'm taking from you then you're gonna get a double portion and what was that double portion he he he saw uh elijah leaving so that was a portion of rapture and also he crossed the jordan so that was a portion of what of resurrection that was his double portion he saw rapture he saw the rapture and he saw the resurrection when you go through this skate you have to receive double portions how many won a double portion tonight and the and the birthright belongs to us by the election of god you know ephraim became the firstborn by election and what happened in israel stretched out his right hand and laid upon ephraim's head who was the younger in his left hand upon manessa's head and guiding his hands willingly but for manis it was manasseh was the firstborn and then verse 20 he says and he blessed them that day saying in this show israel blessed saying god make thee us a frame in us and he said ephraim before menace why the prophet of god says from the jews the oldest the first chosen of god through the cross come to the blessing but come the blessing back to who to the gentiles he cross it and here we are back to the gentiles to to get the bride blessing come through the cross that's why we have to go to the cross from the jew to the gentiles rejected they rejected the cross therefore he got the gentile bride when god went to the gentiles he blended keep lining the eyes of the jews you know i was i was thinking if you have like like a visual here when when uh naomi was there and ruth was there and then when boaz went to ruth the gentile he he was kind of blind in their the eyes of all all of them and he kind of was blind in them and then he was telling rude okay go ahead go ahead pass it go go for it go for it and that's what he did for us he blinded the the eyes of of the gentle people or i mean the jewish people why so because we needed to come he crossed the blessing he said god crossed my hands taking it from the older son the law and put it over on christ and and and through that come through the cross come the change of the birthright amen to the younger son was that third well it was his election in christ is the mystery of god reveal and he was put on a tree of disgrace of course is that is he that hang on a tree because of become a curse for the human race and now he brings forth he didn't just stay there he just went to the to the cross in vain he went to the cross because there had to be somebody else that needed to come and that was when he was crossing that blessing that blessing was for us and it came through this gate and he brings forth what a bright tree which will be the tree of life restored back to him as a husband and wife in the garden of eden her glory to god by the same word and the same god made manifest in husband and wife the same bride the tree the same bright tree back again and he doesn't stay just there we're gonna go to the last one miff cut gate a friend gate double portion now we we're going to the prison gate and from above the gate of ephraim and above the old gate and above the fish gate in the tower the tower of hanonel and the tower of maya even onto the ship gate and they stood still in the prison gate what is this gate you have become a prisoner of christ once you become his you are no longer your own you are his love slave lord pass me through this gate as many times as you want because i'm no longer on my own now i'm yours hundred percent more thousand percent and paul talking to philemon he says paul a prisoner of jesus christ and timothy our brother unto philemon our dearly beloved and fellow laborer but now paul is like you know what i've gone through this gate and now i'm a prisoner of christ amen then in the book of psalms 102 18-21 it says this shall be written for the right generations to come and the people who shall be created shall praise the lord this is a psalmist is prophesying something of a people that shall come a generation that is to come which where is that generation that generation shall praise the lord for he had looked down from the height of his sanctuary from heaven did the lord behold the earth to hear the groaning of the prisoner so if you're a prisoner of christ he's hearing your groaning not just there to lose those that are appointed to death the the the one that was the hated one now became the beloved one to declare the name of the lord in zion and his praise in jerusalem amen now zechariah chapter 9 verse 12 turn you to the stronghold ye prisoners of hope even today do i declare that i will render double unto thee or that i will restore everything you know and what as we were talking last wednesday this is the work of the lord that's why he says i will this i will restore i will go and i will go and to prepare a place he's talking about the i am i will go i will do it i have started a good work in your life and i will finish the work in the day of the lord what is all of this the ship gate praise the lord everything is in there for us to put in practice may we check every gate every lock every bar we must make sure everything is restored this is not a 12-step process this is a cycle that at any time we can go back and check the condition of our hearts gates if you can go back and you know david when he in the psalm he's talking restore unto me the joy of my salvation in other words you know his game was there but he needed some repair he needed some restoration so which gate for you tonight will be like lord it needs some painting it needs some refurbish he's gonna hurt but he's praise the lord for that we can put it this way the process of redemption has started in you before the foundation of the world and as we started with the ship gate where we spoke about the salvation and the sacrifice he made for us and then he brought us to the fish gate what is that where the lord wants us to give testimony that he is alive but he didn't leave us there then we went to the old gate and where he wants us to have that old pentecostal experience the real one that can come and change our lives then he sent us back to the valley gate and what is the valley gate that demand from us humility to be exalted as he was exalted then he brought us to the don gate from where all worldliness must go by but not stay there then he brought us to the fountain gate which is the holy spirit coming and sealing our lives until the day of our redemption and then we went to the watergate that is a that is the importance of revelation in our lives without faith it is impossible to please god and then after giving us revelation he brings us to the horse gate and what is the horse gate is the quickening power quickening that seed that he has already placed in our hearts and he didn't leave us there now he wants us to understand and now he wants us to brings us to the easter gate where we can see him face to face and then he brings us to the verification gate where is the time for us to do inspection in in our lives then the gate of ephraim where he has chosen the gentiles and giving them a double portion them that what the jews rejected he gave it to us and finally he makes us prisoners of his love in the prison gate amen how many are grateful that he didn't leave anything out lord if i need humility if if i need more of your word if i need more of your holy spirit if i need to share my testimony with someone lord may it be so amen let's bow our heads and let's pray the musicians can come this time heavenly father once again thank you for your word thank you for your children that we're so attentive to your word lord thank you for this time this
