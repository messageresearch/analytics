[0:00] chapter 2 and verse 21
[0:02] and the lord god calls the deep sleep to
[0:04] fall upon adam and he slept and he took
[0:06] one of his ribs and closed up the flesh
[0:09] instead thereof
[0:11] and the rib which the lord god had taken
[0:14] from man made he a woman and brought her
[0:17] unto the man so god did all of this and
[0:20] then he separated into them into two
[0:21] vessels they started out as one spirit
[0:25] created in the image of god which god's
[0:26] a spirit so man was a spirit man first
[0:30] and then chapter two then he
[0:32] he breathes the breath of life into a
[0:35] vessel uh adam and both the feminine
[0:38] both adam and eve were in that one
[0:39] vessel then he made him a vessel so that
[0:41] was the next stage and now he takes
[0:43] something out of adam a rib out of adam
[0:45] and he makes a second vessel so now you
[0:47] have the same the same spirit masculine
[0:50] and feminine and also part of the nature
[0:52] of god and now you have two vessels
[0:55] though but still one and notice what god
[0:57] does this and then he brings this woman
[0:58] to the man after after this sleep and he
[1:01] performs surgery on him and
[1:03] and and brings this one now he brings
[1:05] the woman and now adam's going to speak
[1:07] and adam said this is now bone of my
[1:10] bones and flesh of my flesh
[1:12] she shall be called woman because she
[1:15] was taken out of man
[1:17] therefore shall a man leave his father
[1:19] and his mother and shall cleave unto his
[1:21] wife and they shall be one flesh now
[1:24] this is an interesting way to look at it
[1:26] because
[1:27] we know that they're standing there now
[1:29] as two vessels so we could say in our
[1:32] minds
[1:32] no they're not one flesh they're two two
[1:35] vessels
[1:37] but the oneness is so strong and they're
[1:39] still of one spirit that the conclusion
[1:41] to god and the conclusion to adam is
[1:44] they're still one flesh
[1:47] and i want you to catch something in
[1:48] this in speaking about relationships
[1:51] because if we catch this
[1:53] then the way that we look at one another
[1:56] will be changed
[2:00] and they were both naked the man and his
[2:01] wife and were not ashamed i'd like to
[2:03] bring in the new testament in second
[2:05] corinthians
[2:06] chapter 5
[2:19] second corinthians chapter 5 and verse
[2:21] 14
[2:23] for the love of christ constraineth us
[2:27] because we thus judge that if one died
[2:30] for all
[2:31] then we're all dead
[2:34] spiritually speaking now uh we we we see
[2:37] what paul's saying that there's the love
[2:39] of christ is motivating us and he's
[2:42] really going to be talking about how we
[2:43] look at one another how we look at
[2:45] others the love of christ constraineth
[2:48] us because we thus judge if one if one
[2:51] died for all then we're all dead how
[2:53] many know we're all in the same state we
[2:55] all need the lord and then when he went
[2:57] to death then we could die to ourself we
[3:00] all die to ourself and the new man comes
[3:02] to life if that happens within the holy
[3:04] ghost filled believers then we have if
[3:06] god looks at it that way we have to look
[3:09] at it that way that we've all died to
[3:12] our old man in christ and the new man is
[3:15] living in this brother or sister i'm
[3:17] looking at if we look at the old man if
[3:20] we keep looking at the flesh we'll be
[3:22] stumbled
[3:24] god's not stumbled at looking at us he
[3:26] can overlook our flesh he looked beyond
[3:28] our faults and seen our need
[3:31] i'm glad god's not looking at my flesh
[3:33] today
[3:34] but if god's looking at us that way and
[3:37] you remember brother bram said he's
[3:38] looking through the blood
[3:40] when he sees you he can only see you
[3:42] through the blood
[3:44] so if god's looking at us that way then
[3:46] we have to begin to see and this is what
[3:47] he talks about whether uh he says
[3:50] uh
[3:51] and they excuse me if one died for all
[3:53] then we're all dead and that he died for
[3:55] all that they would which live should
[3:57] not henceforth live unto themselves but
[4:00] unto him which died for them and rose
[4:01] again wherefore henceforth from now on
[4:04] from henceforth no we no man
[4:08] after the flesh
[4:11] he's picking up the original principle
[4:15] that he could look at two vessels adam
[4:16] could look at her as a different vessel
[4:18] now but he still said she's she's one
[4:20] flesh with me it's still one flesh
[4:22] and he didn't even look at the flesh
[4:24] he's looking at we're one in spirit
[4:26] okay so and and so wherefore henceforth
[4:30] know we
[4:31] no man after the flesh yea though we
[4:34] know have known christ after the flesh
[4:36] yet now henceforth know we him no more
[4:39] so he's fulfilled his fleshly body days
[4:41] three and a half years on earth 33 years
[4:43] on earth so we don't even know christ
[4:45] and you remember brother brahm said in
[4:46] christ the mystery he said paul
[4:48] knew
[4:50] paul knew jesus in a deeper way by the
[4:52] mystery of christ even greater than the
[4:54] disciples paul never seen jesus in the
[4:56] flesh we would think all the disciples
[4:58] they got a higher position they were
[5:00] with them and fished with them in the
[5:01] flesh but he said paul actually had a
[5:03] greater revelation or a greater view of
[5:06] christ and he never seen him in the
[5:07] flesh
[5:08] so we move to this mystery of what
[5:11] it's not that you see what's going on in
[5:13] the flesh but you see the mystery behind
[5:16] it
[5:17] let me finish this wherefore henceforth
[5:19] know we know man after the flesh yea
[5:21] though we know
[5:22] we have known christ after us yet now
[5:24] henceforth know we him no more therefore
[5:28] if any man be in christ he is a new
[5:31] creature
[5:32] old things are passed away and behold
[5:35] all things
[5:37] are become new
[5:38] praise the lord father thank you for
[5:40] your word may you blessed and anointed
[5:41] today may i lose myself lord into your
[5:44] anointing i pray in jesus name amen god
[5:48] bless you may be seated
[5:54] now i'm taking some points out of
[5:58] this small section here in the time
[6:02] just before the fall if you were looking
[6:04] in your bibles if you're still looking
[6:06] it's in genesis 3 where the serpent
[6:08] comes in
[6:10] and eve is alone without her husband
[6:13] and the serpent comes in
[6:15] and he begins
[6:16] reasoning with her and then we know the
[6:18] fall there's a lot of preachers that
[6:19] preach on the fall where we fell from
[6:22] and it's important to see where we fell
[6:24] but i was going to concentrate in the
[6:25] scriptures just before the fall so i
[6:27] want to title this the relationship
[6:29] before the fall the relationship before
[6:31] the fall just before satan moved in all
[6:34] of us are aware of what the fall has
[6:36] brought us brother brandt went so far as
[6:38] to say every hospital every ambulance
[6:40] that you hear
[6:42] is all come back to
[6:44] a woman reasoning with the serpent with
[6:46] the word and everything fell because she
[6:48] fell from the word
[6:49] the state that we've been in for 6 000
[6:51] years all became
[6:53] from a woman reasoning with the word and
[6:55] satan attacking her when her husband
[6:57] wasn't present satan attacking her and
[6:59] coming and now she everything has come
[7:01] from the fall so we're familiar with
[7:03] those things but i'm just going to talk
[7:04] a little bit about this section and
[7:06] brother branham refers to this and so i
[7:09] want to speak of this because i believe
[7:11] that this state that they were in
[7:14] just before the fall speaks of our walk
[7:17] with the lord right now
[7:19] and that is that calvary has opened up
[7:22] the way
[7:24] back into relationship to god all the
[7:26] relationship we lost in the garden of
[7:28] eden
[7:29] calvary has opened the way to bring us
[7:31] back into relationship again
[7:34] and these are foundational statements
[7:35] many of you know them but i'm assuming
[7:37] maybe many don't because i i need you to
[7:39] catch the foundation i want to tell you
[7:41] again that everything that the fall
[7:43] brought in the beginning calvary has the
[7:46] power to restore us back to all of it
[7:48] again god is taking us back to eden
[7:51] again and he's not stopping halfway with
[7:54] you he's taking us all the way back
[7:56] before the fall he's reversing all
[7:58] everything can you say man so if you've
[8:00] got broken relationships and you've got
[8:02] broken things and you've come from
[8:03] baggage in your family and all kinds of
[8:06] divorce and everything like that that's
[8:08] all as a result of the fall can you say
[8:10] man but i'm here to tell you in our soul
[8:12] level and then god bringing us back to
[8:14] new bodies the power of calvary is
[8:17] restoring us back to everything that has
[8:19] been lost
[8:22] amen so that is calvary and so christ
[8:24] died and he made a way to come back into
[8:27] union
[8:28] by the holy ghost and that is the only
[8:31] way and the only basis for coming back
[8:34] into relationship with god can you say
[8:36] amen the only basis into coming back in
[8:39] a relationship with god is not just
[8:41] calvary because calvary took care of our
[8:44] sins so that we could receive the spirit
[8:46] of god it is only by receiving the holy
[8:49] ghost that we come into contact and
[8:51] relationship with god that we lost in
[8:54] the garden it's not by religion it's not
[8:56] by do's and don'ts it's not by what you
[8:59] wear it's not by some denomination it's
[9:02] not by shaking the preacher's hand it's
[9:04] not by doing good works there's only one
[9:06] thing that would bring us back into
[9:08] relationship that adam and eve lost and
[9:10] that's that we receive his spirit and
[9:13] his nature in our soul
[9:16] that is the only way back in the
[9:18] relationship now i know people can say
[9:20] well i talk to the lord i love the lord
[9:21] it's interesting on the street if you
[9:23] ask somebody if they love christ most
[9:25] people will say yes there's no evidence
[9:27] in their life they don't love the word
[9:29] they're not they're not ever around the
[9:30] word but if you just said i love the i
[9:32] love oh sure i love the lord do you pray
[9:35] of course i pray but you see now that's
[9:37] not the relationship adam and eve have
[9:39] had there's there's a relationship
[9:41] that's a oneness by nature that you come
[9:44] back into that is not just a religion
[9:46] that you pray and you hope god answers
[9:49] back this is a god that answers back can
[9:51] you say amen and one of the ways he
[9:54] answers you back is to fill you with the
[9:56] holy spirit that you have the same
[9:58] desire that is in this bible to live the
[10:01] word
[10:04] and there's no bucking up against it
[10:06] there's no rebellion in your soul
[10:07] there's no desire says i want part of
[10:09] this and i want that's what people do is
[10:11] micromanage parts of the message brother
[10:13] i want this i went no all that's going
[10:15] with the holy ghost and down here it
[10:16] says i'm ready to submit to the word of
[10:19] god i'm ready because i love him because
[10:21] i want him i i love him so much
[10:26] the only way the only grounds of
[10:28] fellowship that god has ever laid down
[10:30] for himself in his church is the oneness
[10:33] of himself in the people that's the only
[10:35] grounds of fellowship and the only way
[10:37] that you can have those grounds is by a
[10:40] union to be united with him forever and
[10:43] that union takes place
[10:45] by
[10:46] the
[10:47] filling
[10:48] of the holy ghost
[10:50] everybody in agreement
[10:51] not by religion not because you go to a
[10:53] message church
[10:56] you only come back in contact with an
[10:58] eden relationship by the true holy ghost
[11:03] so now it's by spirit that we're joined
[11:05] together in this union
[11:07] no other way
[11:09] to be in oneness with god there is no
[11:11] other way you can try other ways you can
[11:13] try works you can try mental discipline
[11:17] you can try vowels
[11:19] the catholic church makes vows of
[11:20] poverty the catholic church has penance
[11:23] they're the first one who begin to
[11:24] develop ways to try to get in
[11:26] relationship with god through works you
[11:28] do penance uh you do you you you pray
[11:31] the rosary
[11:32] you take vows of poverty
[11:35] and that's why luther was so distraught
[11:37] because he tried all of his life to do
[11:38] this he was if you watch the movie or
[11:40] study his life he'd become distraught
[11:43] mother teresa was the same way if you
[11:45] watch her doc read her diaries now which
[11:48] is available this is a woman that
[11:49] actually died without peace and without
[11:52] settled in god and she's a hero as far
[11:55] as what she did in india and places with
[11:57] how she served and all of her life she
[12:00] served as that was the way her entrance
[12:02] and relationship with god but if you
[12:04] read her diaries she's a he's a dying
[12:06] woman and she's a woman who never ever
[12:08] felt satisfied and made contact with god
[12:11] now i'm not putting her out of heaven i
[12:13] wouldn't do that i don't have a right to
[12:14] do that what i'm saying to you is that
[12:16] you can do all the works and be a hero
[12:18] in good works and still not come back to
[12:21] that relationship of eden there's only
[12:23] one way that it comes the true holy
[12:25] spirit his nature comes in your nature
[12:28] your old nature dies and now he's living
[12:31] on the inside it's the only way back.
[12:34] it's not psychology it's not through 10
[12:37] steps to getting better it's not through
[12:39] any of that now i believe that there are
[12:40] certain things that can help people i'm
[12:42] different than some preachers that i
[12:43] believe that you there's certain things
[12:45] that help people i'm not against
[12:46] anything that helps somebody
[12:48] whether it's a physical doctor or an
[12:50] emotional doctor i'm not against it
[12:52] because with the end of the day if they
[12:54] help a person if they help a young boy a
[12:56] young girl they help you in some way to
[12:58] help you through things if some
[13:00] medicines help you i'm not against that
[13:02] because at the end of the day i'm going
[13:03] to give the glory to god but i'm not
[13:05] going to accuse somebody and be against
[13:07] doctors and psychologists that would
[13:10] help somebody and if you read the
[13:11] message you'll find brother branham's
[13:13] attitude is the same way but i want to
[13:15] make it clear there is no psychology of
[13:18] any doctor that it will ever replace
[13:20] the new birth in the holy ghost and the
[13:22] change of your desires
[13:27] that's what you need to pray for for
[13:28] your children
[13:31] not that oh they're a good person i hope
[13:32] there'll be a better place hope they
[13:34] make it church you need to pray that
[13:35] they have a conversion
[13:37] will they love the lord i'm not talking
[13:38] about loving the lord i'm talking about
[13:39] a conversion the new birth that by the
[13:42] way jesus said ye must be born again
[13:46] so you know and
[13:48] every person individually has to cut
[13:50] brother brahman says that it takes a
[13:52] sword of faith to cut away unbelief he
[13:54] said if you want healing you cut away
[13:56] the unbelief and take your healing if
[13:57] you want salvation there's a certain
[13:59] cutting away we got two young people
[14:01] here today you know why they've come to
[14:02] baptism they had to take a little their
[14:05] young their young lives seven nine years
[14:07] old their young lives somehow god moved
[14:10] on their heart and somehow even at their
[14:11] young age had to cut away the unbelief
[14:14] in order to say i want to be saved i
[14:16] want god's salvation for me
[14:18] can you imagine and some of us adults
[14:20] can't even do that but children had to
[14:23] take some part of the sword of faith and
[14:25] cut away that hindrance that says
[14:27] that'll keep them away their whole life
[14:29] i don't need to do it i'm not i'm not
[14:30] like everybody else i don't want it
[14:32] whatever fear you got they had to cut it
[14:34] away you needed to cut it away today
[14:36] because when you cut away all the
[14:37] unbelief then you say i want god's
[14:39] salvation for me
[14:41] somebody say praise the lord this
[14:43] morning so now vows of poverty penance
[14:47] seminary study of the study of the
[14:49] mysteries because you even in this
[14:51] message could study all the mysteries of
[14:54] the bible in this message and still not
[14:56] have the real thing
[14:57] i've listened to preachers that could
[14:58] astound that just astounded me how they
[15:01] could preach the mysteries of this
[15:02] message and today they're not even
[15:04] serving the lord
[15:06] it's because first corinthians says
[15:07] though i understand all mysteries and
[15:10] have not the real thing i am nothing
[15:12] [Applause]
[15:16] so it's not it's not studying all the
[15:18] mysteries and becoming intellectual and
[15:20] know all the quotes it's
[15:22] at the end of the day it's not about
[15:23] that
[15:25] it's about a new birth it's about
[15:27] relationship can you say man
[15:30] and religion is a far cry from
[15:32] relationship
[15:34] religion is a far cry from relationship
[15:39] it's it's not that i love god i talk to
[15:42] god he's done miracles for me
[15:45] it's by the experience of the holy ghost
[15:47] coming into you by nature and changing
[15:49] your nature the only way to love and to
[15:52] live his word is through the holy ghost
[15:56] because the other way
[15:58] is miserable
[16:00] you try to take the principles of god
[16:02] and the principles of this message and
[16:04] you try to live them without the holy
[16:06] ghost
[16:08] that's a miserable life you think the
[16:09] guy out in the bar is living a miserable
[16:11] life
[16:12] no it's more miserable to try to live
[16:14] this word without the nature of the
[16:17] spirit
[16:18] that's why people exit they leave the
[16:20] message whatever because they've been
[16:21] trying so hard trying i'm trying to do
[16:23] this right i'm trying to do this right
[16:24] and yet if you haven't asked deeply
[16:26] enough the lord i forget while all i
[16:28] have to do i'm going to have one prayer
[16:30] i'm going to stay here and keep seeking
[16:32] what i need by the holy ghost until you
[16:34] change me lord you're going to be like
[16:36] jacob with that angel can you say amen
[16:38] i'm not letting you go until you change
[16:40] me
[16:43] that's the prayer that you need
[16:45] and i'm not speaking to everybody in
[16:46] that i know some of you have the holy
[16:48] spirit in your life and you'll see the
[16:50] evidence of that by
[16:52] obeying and saying amen to the word of
[16:54] god you'll see the fruit of it but i'm
[16:55] challenging you this morning not to make
[16:58] you afraid of it but i'm challenging you
[17:00] don't try to get back in a relationship
[17:03] with god by just nodding at the word of
[17:06] just going to brother paul's church i
[17:08] won't let you be deceived like that go
[17:10] before god and say god give me what i
[17:13] need to change my nature
[17:16] give my children what they need
[17:19] and quit playing all these games to
[17:21] justify them i'm not justifying my
[17:23] children i love them i will never not
[17:25] accept them but at the same time they
[17:28] need what i got at 16 years old they
[17:30] need a personal relationship with jesus
[17:32] christ
[17:33] by the holy ghost
[17:35] they need a new birth
[17:38] so i encourage you to seek it whatever
[17:40] age you are here this morning because
[17:42] religion is not relationship
[17:47] religion is not relationship
[17:49] it's a miserable life to try to live
[17:51] this without the nature of god within
[17:52] you as i said
[17:54] we have been restored to this type of
[17:56] oneness again
[17:58] all believers with the true holy spirit
[18:00] in them
[18:02] here's here's one that you can remember
[18:03] this week how many is a believer this
[18:05] morning
[18:07] all believers with this true holy ghost
[18:09] in them
[18:11] have in their soul have fully been
[18:13] restored back to eden in a soul level
[18:20] and now in a soul level you still got
[18:22] this flesh to bring under subjection
[18:24] but in their soul you're not working
[18:26] your way back to eden if you've got the
[18:28] holy ghost you're already back to eden
[18:31] already because you're already in
[18:33] fellowship with him sin has been removed
[18:35] from the your nature the nature of sin
[18:38] the conscience of sin has been removed
[18:40] at the control tower and now the nature
[18:42] of god is there and that's how you have
[18:45] true fellowship and relationship with
[18:47] him can you say amen you are already
[18:49] back to eden
[18:52] you've already arrived back at that
[18:54] relationship already
[18:56] you're not working your way back you're
[18:58] back
[19:02] that's powerful i could preach on that
[19:03] little while
[19:05] you can become a new creation inside the
[19:07] nature and conscience of sin is dead but
[19:09] we are similar with the man and the
[19:11] woman just before the fall
[19:13] as i refer back to it again they were
[19:15] one with god and one with one another
[19:17] but they were in two different vessels
[19:19] right now
[19:21] we don't have our full restoration in
[19:23] our body yet
[19:25] so i want to take some points here out
[19:26] of oneness if you guys have pulled those
[19:28] quotes up i want to take some points out
[19:29] of them one must say oneness message
[19:31] wonderful message and it's very long and
[19:34] and so i listened to it all the way
[19:36] through and i'm going to be taking some
[19:37] points from this the oneness
[19:39] the oneness
[19:40] now the first man and the first woman in
[19:42] the garden of eden was perfect in
[19:43] harmony with god so much that god could
[19:46] come down at any time he desired and
[19:49] talk lip to ear with adam and eve now
[19:51] that is perfect oneness god see there's
[19:54] no walls there's no sin there's nothing
[19:56] breaking the relationship there's no
[19:58] condemnation none of that and so that's
[20:00] why it's a perfect harmony now that is a
[20:02] perfect oneness god in his creation
[20:04] god's speaking lip to ear with adam and
[20:06] eve and they were so perfect in harmony
[20:07] with god till they were one with god
[20:12] god and his family was one any man and
[20:15] his family a correct good noble obedient
[20:18] family is one with one another any
[20:20] family and if there's something in the
[20:21] family that moves them apart
[20:24] obviously that can happen if there's
[20:26] something in the family that can move
[20:27] them apart then it's not right the
[20:29] family is broken somewhere they should
[20:30] all be one father so he's saying the
[20:32] best case scenario in in a family that's
[20:35] following the word and following the
[20:37] holy ghost and the parents have the holy
[20:38] ghost the best case scenario is that
[20:41] they're walking in harmony and the
[20:43] family is not broken they should all be
[20:45] one father with mother mother with
[20:46] father children with a parent parent
[20:48] with children all in agreement now the
[20:50] world has made us cynical to say that
[20:52] can oh boy that can't happen today that
[20:54] hasn't happened for 10 years in my
[20:56] family well there's probably a reason
[20:57] for that because he's given us the best
[20:59] case scenario if you become one with god
[21:01] then you have the potential to be one in
[21:03] your family
[21:04] you have the potential to have a good
[21:06] oneness in your marriage can you say
[21:07] amen don't ever let the devil tell you
[21:10] and settle for second best that it's
[21:12] gonna be this way forever submit
[21:14] yourself to the holy ghost can you say
[21:16] amen and he says the family should be
[21:18] one with one another
[21:21] amen
[21:22] but he says go back to that one he says
[21:24] that is there something that moves them
[21:26] apart now that's what we've got to
[21:28] notice because there are some things
[21:29] that try to move us apart
[21:31] there are things that move us apart
[21:33] there are things that get into our home
[21:35] there are things that get in between
[21:38] sometimes people get in between and
[21:40] break relationship of a marriage
[21:42] their oneness and all of a sudden some
[21:44] family member gets in between and
[21:45] they're divided
[21:47] whatever it is it's not the person it's
[21:48] the devil can you say man but but you
[21:51] say it's never right for them to be
[21:52] broken up it's never right for them to
[21:54] have a lack of oneness next next quote
[21:57] and when you see that you'll see one
[21:58] lovely picture that's god's purpose and
[22:00] his purpose as father supreme was to be
[22:03] one with his family earthly family adam
[22:06] and eve and the only way that they could
[22:07] be one with the family or with god was
[22:10] because god's nature was in them that's
[22:13] what i just preached to you the only way
[22:14] to be one with god is his nature is in
[22:17] you
[22:18] it's the only way
[22:20] every other thing is a religion
[22:22] but his nature sets up
[22:25] ownership and
[22:27] is in the control tower
[22:29] amen and if you'll notice how that eve
[22:31] was united with adam she became part of
[22:33] him god did you notice in genesis 1 27
[22:37] he created male and female created he
[22:39] them now the man both male and female
[22:41] when it come to being in the spirit of
[22:42] feminist and masculine then then god
[22:44] took from his side a rib so before
[22:47] masculine and feminine are in the same
[22:50] spirit and they're in the same vessel
[22:51] than with adam
[22:53] next quote
[22:54] did you notice the body part
[22:57] was a byproduct
[22:58] but not the spirit so when he took this
[23:02] rib out and made another vessel of the
[23:04] woman she was a byproduct but they and
[23:07] that made her different that made her
[23:10] separate
[23:11] but never were they separated in spirit
[23:15] it's just a key point to relationships
[23:17] friends
[23:19] because we've had 6 000 years here
[23:23] after the fall
[23:24] of of seeing of being taught
[23:28] to judge
[23:30] by the flesh
[23:34] you don't think that influences us when
[23:35] we get married and become a family and
[23:38] clashes come and the differences of men
[23:39] and women come and
[23:41] and then somebody doesn't have the holy
[23:42] ghost so they got sin they're dealing
[23:44] with in life they got the nature of sin
[23:46] you don't think that all these brings
[23:47] clashes
[23:49] it does and we are taught we are taught
[23:53] by
[23:54] hollywood we're taught by the system of
[23:56] this world to judge people according to
[23:59] what you see
[24:02] and there are quirks about them and into
[24:05] these days they make fun of the quirks
[24:07] you go through high school they're going
[24:09] to take little funny things like your
[24:11] ears being big and your freckles
[24:13] whatever it is it's so cruel all of a
[24:15] sudden they're going to capitalize on it
[24:17] they're going to put you in a certain
[24:18] category
[24:20] like a redhead
[24:23] us redheads hannah us redheads has
[24:25] suffered
[24:27] terribly through our lives
[24:30] us freckle face people have suffered
[24:32] terrible the persecution
[24:36] the trial
[24:39] we live in a world that judges people
[24:42] by what they see in the flesh
[24:46] i read something this morning that and
[24:48] some writers said he said he said what a
[24:51] world we live in he says now
[24:53] we're i'm going to get to the word honor
[24:54] here in a minute honor
[24:57] do we live in a world where they honor
[24:59] the poor
[25:02] we honor the rich
[25:05] the rich people get honor whether they
[25:06] deserve it or not just because they're
[25:08] rich
[25:09] they wear the right clothes
[25:12] do we honor the people that are
[25:13] unpopular in this world no we honor the
[25:16] movie stars
[25:17] we honor the sports stars
[25:20] we lift them up and praise them and a
[25:22] lot of them most of them are just
[25:25] frankly dirty living people most of the
[25:28] hollywood stars if not all
[25:31] you know some of the this trial that's
[25:32] going on and these things if you watch
[25:34] it some of the stuff the way these
[25:35] people live
[25:37] it's just animals it's absolute animals
[25:39] but these are the people that put out
[25:41] the movies that's leading the whole
[25:43] nation and leading our teenagers and we
[25:45] praise them and we give them awards
[25:48] they walk up during the wards and slap
[25:50] somebody because they get their temper
[25:52] up they're still justified
[25:55] they're animals
[25:59] they live like animals and the reason is
[26:02] is not to judge them but they don't have
[26:04] the holy ghost and when you don't have
[26:06] the holy ghost brother bram says you
[26:07] become an animal you become like a man
[26:10] will rape another woman because he don't
[26:12] have the holy ghost he's it liv he
[26:14] treats her like an animal
[26:16] because he's an animal
[26:18] so six thousand years of this of judging
[26:20] according to the flesh judging according
[26:23] how much money we don't honor the poor
[26:24] but i can tell you that the bible says
[26:27] as we come into the new testament paul
[26:29] speaks about the body of christ and you
[26:30] know what he says he says the one that's
[26:32] in the body of christ that's dishonor or
[26:35] least likely to succeed or the least
[26:37] among us that's the one that we should
[26:39] be honoring
[26:42] the world doesn't function that way
[26:46] that's the one we should honor the one
[26:48] that doesn't have the money
[26:50] doesn't have the prestige
[26:51] doesn't have the right clothes
[26:53] doesn't have very much money
[26:57] praise the lord okay so did you notice
[27:00] the body part was a byproduct but not
[27:02] the spirit the body part of the woman
[27:03] was a byproduct after the creation had
[27:05] been finished
[27:06] god took the side of adam a rib and made
[27:09] a woman but not the spirit the spirit
[27:11] was a part of adam for he was both male
[27:13] and female speaking spiritually both
[27:14] masculine and feminist
[27:16] now don't you see that great picture we
[27:18] in flesh now he goes to us we in flesh
[27:22] are different
[27:23] we're like a byproduct a created being
[27:25] by holy wedlock but in spirit now he's
[27:28] talking about those with the holy ghost
[27:29] but in spirit we are sons and daughters
[27:33] not some other spirit but the spirit of
[27:36] the living god
[27:39] now if he says that i believe it's the
[27:41] truth can you say amen but we have to
[27:43] look at it that way
[27:46] because if we don't we'll still judge
[27:48] one another after the flesh
[27:52] next one
[27:54] and that's what the correct union is and
[27:56] that's what the correct union of the
[27:57] church is spirit of his spirit word of
[28:00] his words never deviating from the word
[28:01] the real true believer will not
[28:03] compromise on any word remember it was
[28:05] just one word that eve compromised on
[28:07] one word but the true believer won't
[28:09] compromise on any word
[28:11] i'll hold the sword of faith with in
[28:12] faith rather the sword of the word and
[28:14] claim every divine promise god made
[28:16] that's it they were he's talking about
[28:18] adam and eve before the fall now that's
[28:20] why i'm preaching this adame just before
[28:22] the fall they were god's examples to us
[28:25] what we should be them ever present
[28:28] never falling when never failing when
[28:31] they spoke god answered he watched them
[28:34] daily night when they lay down to sleep
[28:36] he watched over them
[28:38] in the daytime he guided them fed them
[28:40] loved them commune with them constantly
[28:42] all the time they were in god's image
[28:44] and god was in them that's what makes a
[28:46] fellowship that's what makes the union
[28:47] it's god in his church that's the union
[28:49] much could be said got many places to go
[28:52] united with him is eternal
[28:55] and the only way we can unite with him
[28:57] is to come every bit of his word that's
[28:59] right take every promise and believe it
[29:01] so so friends this is following him
[29:04] it's following his word now what you
[29:06] don't know you see that's different but
[29:09] when he shows you his word and there's a
[29:10] promise laying there of salvation
[29:12] there's a promise laying there of
[29:14] healing there's something in his word
[29:15] you're not running from it you're taking
[29:17] the sword of faith i'm cutting every bit
[29:19] of unbelief that i feel in my head in my
[29:21] heart because i'm wanting that promise
[29:24] so you say believe every word believe
[29:26] every word believe what he shows you
[29:28] there's the promise he showed it to me
[29:30] cut away the devils that are telling you
[29:32] to stay back cut away the devils or tell
[29:34] you i don't need to give my heart to god
[29:36] i don't need to yield him you cut it
[29:38] away say no i want it now you're
[29:40] bringing yourself look what brother
[29:41] braham says here now eve was united
[29:43] until she broke one word doubt in one
[29:45] word that separator every word man shall
[29:47] not live by bread alone but by every
[29:48] word look at this now
[29:50] so we can be in god united because adam
[29:52] and eve before the fall before the
[29:54] disbelieving word was an example of what
[29:57] we could be in him to be united with him
[30:01] his life to be separated from his death
[30:03] now if we follow his commandments
[30:06] so now he's talking about following to
[30:08] me following is somebody walking out
[30:11] ahead showing me the path and i'm
[30:14] following
[30:16] you know i may not be down here yet
[30:20] but i'm i'm whatever he's showing me in
[30:22] the promises of word i'm following it
[30:26] now look what he says now if we follow
[30:28] his commands we know we make mistakes
[30:31] but you mustn't look at that
[30:33] especially now after the fall of sin and
[30:36] we're in sin born bodies
[30:39] we gonna make mistakes
[30:42] and anybody who says they don't
[30:45] gotta they have one mistake and that's a
[30:47] lying problem
[30:50] kind of like parents who say but my kids
[30:52] they never lie
[30:53] well yeah they do because you just lied
[30:56] all right
[30:57] it's not your mistakes because you're
[30:59] always going to have them but you see
[31:01] it's following his rules
[31:03] is following his word
[31:05] following what he said to do
[31:07] stumble and falling doesn't have one
[31:10] thing to do with it a real true servant
[31:13] if he'll stumble he'll get up again if
[31:16] he wobbles god pulls him right back in
[31:18] the path as long as he's in the path of
[31:22] duty
[31:23] so to me this doesn't say perfection yet
[31:26] it says i'm following the word i'm not
[31:28] rebellious saying i ain't doing that i
[31:31] ain't doing that i don't need salvation
[31:32] i'm different than everybody else i'm
[31:34] resisting it that's not following the
[31:36] word but it's what he shows you i'm i'm
[31:38] ready to follow it i'm i'm walking in
[31:40] the path of duty and under that look
[31:43] what he says next under that path of
[31:44] duty but if he's off the path of duty
[31:47] god's not obligated to him but as long
[31:49] as he's in the path of duty god's
[31:52] obligated to him
[31:56] knowing that he's a just man or a woman
[31:58] he's obligated to that person as long as
[32:01] they're in the path of duty
[32:05] i want to live a life
[32:07] where i come under some type of
[32:08] protection
[32:10] that god's obligated to me
[32:13] even when i make a mistake and ask
[32:15] forgiveness because i'm on the path
[32:18] headed towards him
[32:21] god's obligated me friends god's
[32:23] obligated to you
[32:24] you're following that word and walking
[32:26] in the path of duty not out here
[32:27] dabbling in the things of the world and
[32:29] going the opposite when you know what
[32:30] the word says to do
[32:32] god's not obligated to you're losing
[32:34] your protection that's why sometimes
[32:35] people they dabble in worldly things
[32:37] privately and think it's not going to
[32:38] affect them it's not going to affect
[32:40] their family so they're doing it
[32:41] privately thinking this is my own deal i
[32:43] can do my own thing no you watch things
[32:45] happen in your family unconsciously
[32:48] because you're not in the path of duty
[32:49] you're not following him and you watch
[32:51] that start to unravel in your children
[32:54] and it passes it on to other generations
[32:57] you think you're just yourself no
[32:59] things pass on to your children
[33:02] you got rebellion in there and you
[33:03] haven't overcome it then then watch the
[33:06] path of the children
[33:08] not always in every situation but these
[33:10] things trickle down and so you can't
[33:12] privately hold something that you know
[33:14] is against this word you know it and
[33:16] you're you're going to privately go the
[33:18] opposite direction
[33:19] you're going to feel the fruits come
[33:21] from that
[33:23] you're going to start seeing fruits come
[33:25] from that
[33:26] it's better you own up to it yourself i
[33:28] don't know where my children are
[33:30] but i got to get myself straightened out
[33:31] here
[33:33] come on parents let me hear you say amen
[33:36] amen you can blame your children you can
[33:37] blame the preacher you can bring the
[33:39] church you can blame everybody else but
[33:41] you need to be singing it's a me it's a
[33:43] me it's a meal lord standing in the need
[33:45] of prayer
[33:46] because if you start with that
[33:48] i believe god will start to you honor
[33:50] god honor his word honor his servants
[33:55] then you'll watch that sometimes it
[33:56] takes years you'll watch that honor
[33:58] begin to trickle down to your children
[34:03] all right praise the lord
[34:05] still love me
[34:07] all right so that's the end of that
[34:08] quote as long as i love that god's
[34:11] obligated to me
[34:13] i'm holding on to that
[34:15] he's obligated to you when you're on the
[34:17] path of duty even making some mistakes
[34:19] sometimes don't justify your mistakes
[34:22] don't keep doing something in a pattern
[34:24] that you keep just saying well god will
[34:26] forgive me no no no i'm not talking
[34:27] about that i'm talking about you make a
[34:29] mistake
[34:30] it's not a willful thing i'm just doing
[34:31] this no but you make a mistake god
[34:34] forgive me i didn't mean to do that you
[34:35] get back on the path of duty god is
[34:38] obligated to you
[34:41] praise the lord
[34:42] so now
[34:44] and it's not just
[34:45] let me just move on here
[34:48] it's you had it's not just you believing
[34:50] the word but you're heading in its
[34:51] direction not the opposite direction not
[34:53] rebellion not i'm not going to do that
[34:56] i'm going to feed and taste on these
[34:58] things privately when the war the word
[35:00] warns you and you know what's wrong with
[35:02] the word
[35:03] while you're on the word journey he is
[35:04] obligated to you to protect you to
[35:06] forgive you but if you're going in the
[35:08] other direction you lose relationship
[35:10] with god god is not obligated to you now
[35:13] here's some points from the text
[35:15] in genesis 2.
[35:18] they were one in spirit
[35:21] and god called their name adam okay
[35:25] second then god breathed into
[35:28] a vessel in genesis 2
[35:31] verse 7 and the lord formed man of the
[35:34] dust of the ground and breathed into his
[35:35] nostrils the breath of life the man
[35:37] became a living soul so now he becomes a
[35:39] vessel he was spirit man first
[35:42] with adam and eve inside him now he's a
[35:45] flesh man with one vessel but the spirit
[35:49] is all one with masculine and feminine
[35:52] inside of it still
[35:54] all right
[35:55] so then
[35:57] then god
[35:59] comes down and says in genesis 2
[36:02] he still called at him
[36:04] then
[36:04] he says it's not good for man to be
[36:06] alone i'll make him a helpmate
[36:08] right
[36:10] and then he
[36:12] he then god
[36:14] causes a sleep to come on adam
[36:16] and he takes the rib out
[36:18] he takes as many ministers have said i
[36:20] don't mean to repeat but it's a good
[36:21] thing to repeat you know he didn't take
[36:23] apart out of adam's foot
[36:28] to make the woman
[36:30] or the brain can you say man
[36:33] but something right real close to his
[36:35] heart
[36:37] did you ever notice they took that spear
[36:39] and pierced right up there under jesus
[36:41] and water and blood came out because the
[36:43] spirit in that was going to come back on
[36:45] the day of pentecost
[36:47] this would be the second eve coming back
[36:49] that's one with the second adam
[36:52] by what by spirit
[36:55] took that rib right something very close
[36:57] to his heart and he forms this
[37:00] beautiful beautiful
[37:02] feminine part in a different vessel
[37:05] looked different
[37:06] even acted different and a few weeks ago
[37:09] i went into the differences and and i'm
[37:11] not going to get into that day today
[37:13] again but you just i the lord keeps
[37:16] bringing me back to this
[37:18] this this situation or this oneness just
[37:21] before the fall because
[37:23] it's close to us in that we deal with
[37:25] different vessels
[37:27] with different personalities
[37:29] and different backgrounds
[37:32] and we can judge people based upon
[37:34] fleshly things
[37:37] and miss
[37:38] that we are one
[37:44] he takes her out and he goes over there
[37:46] and wakes adam up
[37:48] and then he comes and brings eve over
[37:50] and bible says he brought eve to adam
[37:53] and he's waking up and he's rubbing his
[37:54] eyes you know and he's looking and
[37:57] and uh
[37:58] brother ramp said some wonderful things
[37:59] about this first moment that adam sees
[38:03] she wasn't even called eve yet
[38:05] but this first moment
[38:07] where
[38:08] he's rubbing his eyes and he opens up
[38:10] and he sees
[38:12] this
[38:13] beautiful
[38:14] other vessel
[38:16] that god gave him
[38:18] and there's some there look there's
[38:20] something there looking at the flesh
[38:21] because he was he was overwhelmed but we
[38:23] have to be careful that we don't become
[38:26] fleshy too much in that that he was
[38:27] overwhelmed just by the flesh because
[38:30] his words that come out of his mouth
[38:32] was not
[38:34] like some people make it very fleshly
[38:36] like it was all remember there's a holy
[38:38] veil on their eyes
[38:41] so the nakedness and the physical
[38:44] was not noticed yet
[38:47] some people get married
[38:51] only on physical
[38:54] attraction
[38:57] bad foundation
[38:59] terrible foundation
[39:01] and some people have got married that
[39:02] way and god shows them what true oneness
[39:05] is later and they come to a real oneness
[39:07] in marriage it can happen but the best
[39:09] foundation is that you understand by
[39:11] revelation what oneness is what love is
[39:14] what christian marriage is
[39:17] before you even have a girlfriend
[39:21] he comes up and god brought it and then
[39:23] now notice now
[39:25] now god just once he brings eve
[39:30] up to him
[39:31] notice it's not a response of the flesh
[39:36] it's a response of oneness
[39:41] right
[39:42] brings her up there
[39:43] and if it had been fleshed like the
[39:45] world says i heard preacher saying
[39:46] something about
[39:47] that's how she got her name is the first
[39:49] thing adam says
[39:51] whoa
[39:52] man
[39:57] that's not in the bible
[39:59] so he's a man and that's how she got
[40:01] woman is oh man
[40:06] please don't be offended i there's
[40:07] another preacher who said it not me
[40:13] that's you know that's the type of
[40:14] response when you've been living on
[40:16] hollywood your whole life
[40:18] whoa sister wow
[40:20] yeah
[40:22] i like what you got going on all these
[40:23] other statements and it's all flesh
[40:27] you don't have to know the personality
[40:28] you don't have to know the character of
[40:29] a woman just judged all by body and
[40:32] flesh and
[40:34] sleep with them the first night
[40:36] it's all fleshly no oneness no unity
[40:41] no character
[40:43] but adam's got the glory of god on him
[40:45] remember i said the glory of god brings
[40:47] oneness it's a revelation of oneness
[40:49] he's got the glory of god and that's why
[40:51] he can look at her different
[40:53] so he comes up and brother branham
[40:54] explains it first time he sees her you
[40:56] know and and the hebrew writers take
[40:59] this word
[41:00] bone of my bone flesh my flesh and it's
[41:02] actually they say it was a song
[41:04] it was a song so he's he's so
[41:06] overwhelmed by the first time he sees
[41:08] eve it's like he's
[41:11] honey you knew i was going to use you as
[41:12] an example today danny
[41:22] he is so overwhelmed the first time his
[41:24] eyes
[41:25] she's got a gingham dress on today and
[41:27] the whole thing
[41:29] he's so overwhelmed by this that he just
[41:32] becomes a songwriter
[41:36] never says he was before but now he
[41:38] comes he's a songwriter he's just so
[41:39] overwhelmed and i think there was some
[41:41] romance involved there
[41:43] you know and he yes he just blurts out
[41:46] this and the hebrew writer says just
[41:47] it's the most affectionate romantic i'm
[41:50] going to get into the deeper things of
[41:51] what he meant by bone and bone flesh but
[41:53] when he utters that it's a song
[41:55] he looks at her and it's not a fleshly
[41:57] thing
[41:58] it's it's she first words she
[42:04] he just sings let me think of something
[42:05] here
[42:11] you
[42:13] are flesh of my flesh
[42:17] bone of my bone
[42:20] there's no one closer
[42:23] you
[42:24] are flushing my flesh oh
[42:32] there's no one closer and he just goes
[42:35] on and on and then he says you shall be
[42:38] called
[42:39] woman because you came from me
[42:43] and then he says this is your three
[42:44] things you're bone of my bone your flesh
[42:47] and my flesh
[42:49] out you should be called woman because
[42:51] you came from the man
[42:53] and then he says and the two
[42:56] are one flesh
[42:58] that's all oneness
[43:00] that's all revelation of oneness
[43:03] even the vessel is different
[43:05] and if he was a man he had to notice she
[43:07] was pretty brother brown said she was a
[43:08] pretty one he said he grabs her hand and
[43:10] starts walking through the garden there
[43:12] is no death there is no sorrow there's
[43:14] nothing between them and they start
[43:16] walking he's got this beautiful wife
[43:18] that he's looking at and they're walking
[43:20] through that garden and she says
[43:22] something like you know
[43:24] that's not quite where it should be
[43:26] kind of like a woman when she's in the
[43:27] house
[43:31] different nature i don't like that there
[43:34] i don't like that table
[43:37] josiah
[43:38] that don't fit anymore
[43:41] so at the garage sale yesterday
[43:43] i bought the table off the man because
[43:45] the wife nuked it that's going that's
[43:47] one of his bachelor days
[43:52] got you covered i'm buying that for you
[43:53] bud
[43:54] just wait and see if my wife accepts it
[43:56] in our home
[44:00] we were laughing at the in the office
[44:02] that you josiah because
[44:03] somebody said to you when you're a
[44:05] bachelor you're buying all this nice
[44:06] stuff and they said you're spending too
[44:08] much money because your wife when you
[44:10] get married someday she's going to have
[44:12] you get rid of all of it
[44:15] i'm glad sister ashley's not in here
[44:16] right now
[44:20] she his brother said she's she said i
[44:22] like this is he and he just speaks and
[44:24] changes that river and changes where
[44:26] that's at
[44:27] see this moves this mountain and just
[44:30] but the harmony the fellowship i got to
[44:32] get back up here to my notes because i
[44:33] want to read some things about this bone
[44:35] of my bone flesh of my it's pretty
[44:37] romantic but there's some deeper meaning
[44:40] to it and brother brahm says i think
[44:42] adam and eve was the most perfect couple
[44:43] that ever walked on earth i could see
[44:45] adam and his not as great shoulders like
[44:47] barn doors but a perfect built man eve
[44:50] beautiful the most beautiful woman i can
[44:52] see her now she woke up after the
[44:54] operation from adam and he looked at her
[44:56] her beautiful hair hanging down her back
[44:58] her eyes sparkle with stars above adam
[45:00] touching her by the flesh and said she's
[45:02] flesh in my flesh and bone of my bone
[45:05] beautiful never to fade out those lips
[45:10] those lips
[45:12] they wouldn't have to use this here
[45:14] manic here or what the stuff you put on
[45:16] your face now to make themself look
[45:19] pretty
[45:20] sin caused you to do that
[45:22] god made you perfect
[45:25] hello
[45:28] said your name shall be a woman you came
[45:29] out of me i want you to notice something
[45:32] here now i'm just going to sit on this
[45:33] just a minute still got time
[45:37] i want you to notice the surprise
[45:40] the honor
[45:42] the respect the praise
[45:45] the love
[45:47] the word honor in hebrew
[45:50] is surprising it is the word kavadh
[45:54] which is the word for glory
[45:57] it means to be weighty in one respect
[46:00] that is bearing a burden of a weighty
[46:01] issue glory
[46:03] the word kavadh also means to be
[46:05] important we are to always recognize
[46:09] the importance and this rabbi refers to
[46:12] the word honor it's throughout the bible
[46:13] but it has a it's a deeper meaning than
[46:15] what we think
[46:16] and he refers to the children should
[46:19] honor their father and mother it's one
[46:21] of the commandments
[46:22] and even in that he says we are to
[46:24] always recognize listen to this now we
[46:27] are to always recognize the importance
[46:29] of our parents
[46:31] no matter how good or bad they are
[46:34] they have a connection to us and we
[46:36] recognize they're important to us
[46:41] so when god used honor for honoring
[46:43] parents
[46:44] under our fallen condition that means
[46:46] they won't do everything perfect
[46:50] but we never ever dishonor them
[46:54] even though they've acted imperfect
[47:00] dishonor is never
[47:03] should never be tolerated it should
[47:05] never be justified
[47:08] in the body of christ
[47:10] among preachers
[47:13] in your marriage
[47:16] disrespect and dishonor
[47:20] should never be justified
[47:22] in a christian home
[47:26] speaking words of dishonor speaking
[47:28] words of belittling i've even heard some
[47:31] cussing out their kids
[47:33] and then they go to church
[47:36] i'm sorry
[47:37] it doesn't work that way in the kingdom
[47:39] of god
[47:40] honor should be there
[47:43] always
[47:45] no matter how you feel about their flesh
[47:47] no matter how much they meet irritating
[47:49] you no matter how he's saying this rabbi
[47:51] is saying that that honor your father
[47:53] and mother
[47:54] you may not feel like you love them
[47:56] sometimes because the love has not been
[47:58] in many parents many situations many of
[48:01] you come from and sometimes our own
[48:03] parents
[48:04] you don't feel loved you were abandoned
[48:06] there's a lot of broken situations but
[48:08] you see now god says honor doesn't
[48:10] change
[48:12] you don't have to tolerate if they're
[48:13] abusing you have to tolerate that but
[48:15] you should always retain so if that's
[48:17] true in the word honor then we have this
[48:19] coming from adam to the first time he
[48:21] sees his wife such surprise
[48:24] such honor and even honor weighty glory
[48:28] even in that i it it it has a deeper
[48:31] word like
[48:32] you're in all and i believe adam was in
[48:35] awe
[48:36] and it expressed there's something about
[48:38] when you have an awe about something and
[48:41] you you look at something that you honor
[48:43] and respect and this is important and
[48:45] this is supreme
[48:46] they see it in your eyes i think eve
[48:49] seen it in adam's eyes the surprise the
[48:52] honor the respect you are bone in my
[48:54] bone you're flesh to my flesh
[48:56] you're part of me
[49:00] there's nev there's no disrespect there
[49:02] there's no dishonor there
[49:07] this should be happening
[49:09] in the kingdom of god
[49:11] another word one writer said it's just
[49:13] and if you go deeper it's just you're
[49:15] standing at all it's like surprises it
[49:17] takes your breath away i think eve took
[49:19] adam's breath away
[49:23] and he brings this down to a when we
[49:26] first meet people a lot of times or we
[49:28] meet somebody that we think is important
[49:30] and they walk in the room and you don't
[49:32] you didn't realize they're going to walk
[49:33] in
[49:36] wow
[49:38] brother bob
[49:40] it's you
[49:44] he walks in the room
[49:46] brother bob
[49:49] it's you
[49:52] i can't believe you're in my presence i
[49:54] can't believe you're here
[49:56] this is awesome no yeah i'm talking to
[49:58] you
[50:00] this
[50:01] this is
[50:02] this is amazing just to be around you
[50:06] one of the words for honor goes back to
[50:08] that it says
[50:09] you're standing on problem is
[50:11] a lot of times when we meet people the
[50:12] first time that's the way we act
[50:14] but when we get to know him
[50:18] all the all is gone
[50:22] it's kind of like that woman at the
[50:23] airport it's terrible to show
[50:25] you know i'm not a dog lover but
[50:27] i have all these stories she comes to
[50:28] the airport she gets off the plane i
[50:30] watch her outside by the car her husband
[50:31] picks her up
[50:33] and
[50:34] the dog's in the car and the dog's there
[50:37] and
[50:38] she can't wait to get to that dog
[50:40] not her husband that dog that's in the
[50:42] car
[50:45] and her husband comes around and grabs
[50:46] her luggage and she goes hello george
[50:49] and grabs that dog and
[50:52] punchy boogie
[50:57] hello george
[50:59] yeah stick it in the car and this dog's
[51:01] getting all the
[51:03] honor
[51:09] and i said
[51:10] we're living in a crazy world
[51:13] i guarantee you if that man got that
[51:16] kind of response from his wife
[51:18] he'd be a different man
[51:21] never mind the dog oh george george i
[51:24] miss you so much you're the greatest man
[51:26] in the face
[51:27] i love you i love you
[51:32] i'm telling you
[51:34] that would do something to a man
[51:39] you know we gotta get all these
[51:40] self-helps and all these other things
[51:42] but if a woman responds to a man
[51:44] correctly you're gonna change that man
[51:47] and it's simply called honor and respect
[51:49] and if you don't have godly honor and
[51:52] respect and this all to your children
[51:55] that they see that they you're happy to
[51:58] have them around
[51:59] that the wife sees he's happy to have me
[52:01] in his life that the husband sees she's
[52:04] happy that i'm around that i've made it
[52:06] home from work
[52:08] if this could continue not just when we
[52:11] first meet them
[52:14] but if this could be something in our
[52:15] homes and families
[52:18] then a lot of times when you have honor
[52:20] respect let me say to you young people
[52:22] if you don't have honor
[52:24] if you're going to be physical with that
[52:25] girl or that guy you do not honor that
[52:27] girl or that guy
[52:29] there's no honor
[52:30] there and you need to repent of dishonor
[52:34] if you don't have honor and you don't
[52:36] have respect
[52:37] and you don't have the lord
[52:39] you don't have any basis for a marriage
[52:44] amen brother paul tell it like it is
[52:49] praise the lord
[52:54] so
[52:56] it's this initial meeting of adam that
[52:57] has such honor and it continues no
[53:00] matter what the flesh is remember the
[53:02] rabbi
[53:03] it's continuing he says this honor is
[53:05] continuing in a state of high esteem and
[53:08] all it's continuing in this state of
[53:11] honoring somebody now it gets hard when
[53:13] somebody does you wrong
[53:16] somebody that has
[53:18] really done you dastardly wrong
[53:20] it gets hard when some people have
[53:22] treated you or said bad words to you
[53:23] wrong words to you a husband has treated
[53:25] you wrong a wife that's treated you
[53:27] wrong children that have rebelled
[53:29] against you this the test comes now
[53:32] but we must always remain
[53:35] in a high esteem of respect
[53:39] see people don't think that you can't
[53:41] honor and respect and still disagree you
[53:43] can disagree with the direction a child
[53:46] is going
[53:47] but we never have a right to dishonor
[53:49] them
[53:50] or disrespect them
[53:54] we're trying to help our relationships
[53:57] trying to help our relationships i hope
[53:59] you're listening
[54:01] so no longer under one vessel the glory
[54:04] of god is in adam because the glory of
[54:05] god is still in adam he could never see
[54:07] her any other way than one he seen she
[54:09] was flesh but he looked at them as if
[54:11] there's still one flesh there is no
[54:13] disrespect here there's no dishonoring
[54:16] there's no in your face yelling in her
[54:18] face there's none of that that all came
[54:20] from the fallen brother i'll tell you
[54:22] you go back and read the scripture i
[54:23] read a couple weeks ago she is heirs
[54:26] together of the life of god and if you
[54:29] dishonor her if you do not treat her
[54:32] right
[54:33] god will not hear your prayers
[54:37] i quoting the bible
[54:40] so don't think this is just a new
[54:41] testament old testament thing this is
[54:42] the new testament as well
[54:44] it was the fall
[54:45] it was the fall that brought disrespect
[54:49] dishonor
[54:51] blaming one another
[54:54] it was the pride of the fall that
[54:56] brought in the possibility of a divorce
[54:59] brought in adultery can you say man
[55:01] brought in disrespect brought in abuse
[55:04] it was the fall that brought all that in
[55:06] can you say amen
[55:07] it was the hardness of heart that wasn't
[55:09] in adam and eve before but now there's
[55:11] hardness of heart and jesus said some of
[55:13] the divorces happen just because of the
[55:15] hardness of your heart they're trying to
[55:17] blame everybody else and a lot of times
[55:18] in divorce you're blaming one another
[55:20] and you have legitimate things to say
[55:22] but jesus said
[55:23] when hearts become hard that's why moses
[55:26] had to give you a writing of divorcement
[55:30] we never had that until after the fall
[55:34] but we're a people
[55:35] that by the power of the blood of the
[55:37] lamb and the power of the resurrected
[55:39] christ are being restored
[55:42] back to oneness
[55:44] with god
[55:45] with one another in relationships can
[55:48] you say man
[55:49] and don't you worry about that stubborn
[55:51] husband or that stubborn wife or that or
[55:54] that stubborn child don't you dwell on
[55:56] that you hold your heart by faith and
[55:59] say lord let me grow and honor and
[56:01] respect the best way that i can don't be
[56:04] abused you don't have to tolerate all
[56:06] this abuse and everything but just keep
[56:08] the honor keep the respect and keep
[56:10] praying for that individual who needs a
[56:13] new birth can you say amen that god
[56:15] would show them you keep praying can you
[56:17] say amen because god will honor your
[56:19] honor
[56:22] i should have got a bigger amen than
[56:23] that do you believe that
[56:25] god will honor you and respect you in
[56:27] difficult situations if you'll offer
[56:30] honor and respect
[56:32] don't be abused
[56:33] but you hold that esteem there
[56:35] continually
[56:37] and let god do the work
[56:39] is this helping anybody this morning
[56:42] there's no disrespect there it's only
[56:44] honor it was the fall that caused men
[56:47] and women disrespect honor prejudice it
[56:50] was the fall that brought prejudice it's
[56:51] the fall that brought racism
[56:54] can you say amen
[56:55] it was the fall that brought a woman is
[56:57] a lesser class human being than a man i
[56:59] know she was the weaker vessel and after
[57:01] the fall she had to be put under the
[57:03] man's headship but god did it to protect
[57:05] her she was she was a vessel that could
[57:07] be vulnerable to the enemy
[57:10] come on inviso admit it and it was when
[57:13] she was alone with the serpent without
[57:14] her husband there then she'd become
[57:16] reasoning with the serpent and
[57:17] everything began to unravel can you say
[57:20] amen so so i understand that but i'm
[57:22] telling you after calvary we have the
[57:24] revelation she is the weaker vessel but
[57:27] by spirit she is one with the husband
[57:30] that's why when sarah lied to elohim
[57:34] god could not kill her because she was
[57:36] under the lordship and the headship of
[57:38] her husband so much
[57:40] god could not kill her because he'd have
[57:42] to kill abraham and he wasn't going to
[57:44] kill his son abraham she was protected
[57:47] because of her honor of her husband
[57:50] she made a mistake
[57:52] she was wrong for what she did she was
[57:54] wrong for several things
[57:56] she manipulated the hagar brought her in
[57:59] there trying to make the promise come to
[58:01] pass she did several things that she
[58:03] shouldn't do but god's grace was over
[58:05] her because there's something in there
[58:07] she come under her husband's headship
[58:09] so after the fall
[58:11] he had to put her there for a protection
[58:13] a lot of people would say even this
[58:15] message she's a lesser
[58:16] individual and you know she's
[58:19] you know and god put her in her place
[58:22] and well but the place he gave her was a
[58:25] place of protection
[58:28] you're reading it wrong can you say that
[58:30] she shall be saved in childbearing and
[58:32] and all these things there's there was a
[58:34] place for her because why god does not
[58:36] break the unity of the man and woman
[58:39] like he don't break the unity of the
[58:40] bride of christ in christ it can't be
[58:42] broken what god has joined together no
[58:44] man can put asunder
[58:46] so god puts a protection in place for
[58:48] the woman and her vulnerability
[58:50] but
[58:52] don't forget
[58:53] in spirit
[58:55] brother
[58:56] she's one
[59:00] she's not a weaker vessel in spirit
[59:02] matter of fact some women they'll grow
[59:04] in faith
[59:06] sometimes before their husband does
[59:09] he still needs a new birth and doing
[59:11] stuff and the woman's growing in faith
[59:12] and then he comes later happens
[59:14] sometimes
[59:15] so by spirit those are different we make
[59:17] differences in flesh but by spirit
[59:20] she should be treated as one
[59:24] one rabbi said the bone of my bone flesh
[59:27] of my flesh he said this phase this
[59:29] phrase excuse me bonobo my bone flesh my
[59:32] flesh this phrase is a sign of equality
[59:35] we are one
[59:37] we are connected we are equal we're made
[59:40] in the image of god we are of the same
[59:42] bone and flesh but our bodies are more
[59:44] than just a bag of bones
[59:46] we are made by god and that's pretty
[59:49] amazing we are connected to each other
[59:51] by bone and flesh and for those who have
[59:54] cemented a relationship with yahweh
[59:56] we are bound together by god's spirit
[1:00:00] his breath that rabbi says his breath
[1:00:02] god's spirit
[1:00:05] we are one we're not some separate
[1:00:07] entity as a christian
[1:00:09] we are one and have the same spirit as
[1:00:11] him
[1:00:13] oh i can hear the second adam say the
[1:00:15] first adam says
[1:00:17] woman
[1:00:19] we're one flesh you're born of my bone
[1:00:21] flesh in my flesh he sings the song i
[1:00:23] can hear the second adam speak through
[1:00:26] his prophet paul and say in ephesians 5
[1:00:29] husbands love your wives even as christ
[1:00:32] also loved the church and gave himself
[1:00:34] forward that he might sanctify and
[1:00:36] cleanse it with the washing of the water
[1:00:38] by the word that he might present it to
[1:00:40] himself a glorious church not having
[1:00:43] spot or wrinkle or any such thing but
[1:00:45] that it should be holy and without
[1:00:47] blemish so ought men to love their wives
[1:00:50] as their own bodies he that loveth his
[1:00:53] wife loveth himself why because you see
[1:00:56] yourself is not two entities but you see
[1:00:59] yourself as one
[1:01:04] for we are members of his body of his
[1:01:05] flesh and of his bones now he says he
[1:01:08] says
[1:01:09] for this cause
[1:01:12] shall a man leave his father shall join
[1:01:14] his wife and they too shall be one flesh
[1:01:16] this is a great mystery but i speak
[1:01:18] concerning christ and the church the
[1:01:21] second adam spoke about his wife he
[1:01:24] spoke again i can hear the second adam
[1:01:26] speak through his prophet of the last
[1:01:28] days and say the words i no longer call
[1:01:31] you church
[1:01:32] i call you bride i can hear the second
[1:01:35] adam speak to his prophet of the last
[1:01:37] days in the message uniting time and
[1:01:40] sign when he says everything's uniting
[1:01:43] communism's uniting the world council is
[1:01:45] uniting the churches will unite because
[1:01:47] it's a uniting sign israel is uniting
[1:01:50] but he says the greatest thing is the
[1:01:52] church the bride is uniting with christ
[1:01:56] can you say amen this is the day of
[1:01:58] union that we know we're one with him
[1:02:02] that's why he preaches invisible union
[1:02:04] of the bride of jesus christ and christ
[1:02:07] why is he bringing those themes it's our
[1:02:08] second adam telling us again
[1:02:11] there's an invisible union taking place
[1:02:13] uh you're not a separate entity you're
[1:02:15] not a christian that's just a with a
[1:02:17] religion trying to follow the lord no no
[1:02:19] no no you're one in spirit with me
[1:02:22] that's why i can say amen to this bible
[1:02:24] and this message
[1:02:25] because i'm one in spirit with the
[1:02:26] husband
[1:02:29] the author that wrote it can you say
[1:02:31] amen
[1:02:32] when you know the author
[1:02:34] i met the man
[1:02:36] who wrote the book
[1:02:39] used to be a song i met him i met the
[1:02:42] man
[1:02:43] who wrote the book and so i read it
[1:02:45] naturally
[1:02:46] and while reading it i learned that it
[1:02:48] was written just for me
[1:02:51] the bible is the greatest book it's
[1:02:54] words i highly treasure
[1:02:57] the bible is the greatest book
[1:02:59] since i met the author
[1:03:04] it's about relationship friends
[1:03:06] and when you meet the author you don't
[1:03:08] have trouble with his book
[1:03:11] when you meet the author you don't have
[1:03:12] trouble with his prophets
[1:03:15] uniting together there's an invisible
[1:03:17] union
[1:03:18] there's a movement
[1:03:19] within our ranks even
[1:03:22] that's the traits of the has the traits
[1:03:23] of denomination in it i need this
[1:03:25] respectfully but i'm going to be honest
[1:03:28] there are movements in pockets in this
[1:03:29] message movement that has the traits of
[1:03:32] denomination in it more than what we
[1:03:34] realize
[1:03:36] it's because people only label a sign on
[1:03:38] the door denomination
[1:03:40] but they don't understand it's a spirit
[1:03:43] and on some of our pockets there's an
[1:03:45] organizational denominational spirit
[1:03:47] that is creeped in
[1:03:49] this message will never denominate i
[1:03:51] know the core of it will never done you
[1:03:53] can't denominate god
[1:03:56] but just like all the history men can
[1:03:57] take the message break it up do all this
[1:04:00] stuff to it make a religion out of it
[1:04:02] make a code of ethics out of it make
[1:04:04] this a men do that can you say that and
[1:04:06] we have a denominational spirit in our
[1:04:09] midst
[1:04:10] sometimes and people don't pick up on it
[1:04:13] but i want to proclaim with all of my
[1:04:15] heart this message in this word is never
[1:04:18] about religion it's about relationship
[1:04:22] it's about relationship
[1:04:25] it's to restore relationship with our
[1:04:28] god that we can walk in the cool of the
[1:04:30] evening and have fellowship unhindered
[1:04:33] with him again
[1:04:34] and it also is to restore relationships
[1:04:37] in your marriages and your families
[1:04:42] if it doesn't it doesn't have enough
[1:04:43] power to it i believe it has enough
[1:04:44] power to do it
[1:04:46] keep believing can you say amen
[1:04:50] he only sees christ i've got to find a
[1:04:52] place to end here my conclusion is adam
[1:04:55] could not look at eve
[1:04:58] any other way
[1:04:59] except as being part of him
[1:05:03] just like god can't look at you any
[1:05:04] other way
[1:05:05] he can't see you any other way except
[1:05:07] part of him
[1:05:09] that's why he protects you that's how
[1:05:10] he's watched over you your ups and downs
[1:05:12] and in and out and backslid for years
[1:05:14] and
[1:05:15] he but he can't look at you any other
[1:05:17] way than his daughter or his
[1:05:20] son i said at the beginning are you glad
[1:05:23] doesn't god doesn't look at you
[1:05:24] according to the flesh
[1:05:26] i'm so glad he doesn't look at you that
[1:05:28] way
[1:05:30] he says you're bone of my bone you're
[1:05:32] flesh in my flesh
[1:05:33] you're a spirit of my spirit your life
[1:05:36] of my life
[1:05:39] and so here's my other text as i close
[1:05:41] today it was in
[1:05:44] i forget where it was at second
[1:05:46] corinthians 5 as paul picks it up
[1:05:48] towards the end and i'm going to read it
[1:05:50] in the amplified you guys can put it up
[1:05:51] in the
[1:05:52] king james but i'm going to read this in
[1:05:54] the amplified
[1:05:57] for the love of christ controls us and
[1:06:00] compels us how many want the love of
[1:06:02] christ controlling you and compelling
[1:06:04] you
[1:06:06] because we have concluded this
[1:06:09] that one died for all therefore all died
[1:06:13] and he died for all so that all those
[1:06:16] who live would no longer live for
[1:06:18] themselves
[1:06:20] but for him who died and was raised for
[1:06:23] their sake and here's the conclusion so
[1:06:26] from now on
[1:06:28] so from now on
[1:06:30] we regard no one
[1:06:32] from a human standpoint
[1:06:36] from now on how many would raise i said
[1:06:38] god help me i need help in this
[1:06:42] because god views it this way from now
[1:06:46] on we regard no one from a human point
[1:06:49] of view and that's according to worldly
[1:06:52] standards and values
[1:06:55] we've been taught the worldly standards
[1:06:56] how to view somebody how to judge
[1:06:57] somebody
[1:07:01] but from now on
[1:07:03] from henceforth
[1:07:05] no we no man
[1:07:07] after the flesh
[1:07:09] can you say amen
[1:07:11] next sunday i want to get into 10
[1:07:14] factors that
[1:07:16] we're always making distinctions in the
[1:07:17] flesh
[1:07:19] we judge on appearance we judge on
[1:07:21] ability we judge on age
[1:07:23] we judge on the friends a person has
[1:07:26] we judge on race we judge on gender we
[1:07:29] judge on the work and accomplishments
[1:07:31] we judge on
[1:07:33] home
[1:07:34] we judge on the family
[1:07:35] family origin somebody comes from
[1:07:38] and we judge on someone's experience
[1:07:42] all of those things
[1:07:45] are not what we're supposed to judge
[1:07:46] somebody on
[1:07:50] it's all worldly judgment
[1:07:52] and we
[1:07:53] we we conclude about somebody based upon
[1:07:56] all those things because we've been
[1:07:57] taught to
[1:07:58] we conclude on all these fleshly we're
[1:08:02] not supposed to live in the flesh we're
[1:08:04] supposed to live in the spirit we're
[1:08:05] supposed to see by the spirit
[1:08:09] you want to hear a good message it's
[1:08:10] called discernment of spirit brother
[1:08:12] bran preached it and i can't believe
[1:08:14] what he says in there he says don't put
[1:08:16] down
[1:08:16] the baptist man don't put down
[1:08:19] the methodist man
[1:08:21] if you have discernment a spirit
[1:08:24] you discern what their motive is
[1:08:27] and if their motive is right in the
[1:08:29] kingdom of god don't you dare speak
[1:08:31] against that
[1:08:34] well we've got a lot of lack of
[1:08:35] discernment in the message
[1:08:38] because we just say if they're in that
[1:08:40] then there can't be no god there there
[1:08:42] can't be anything there that's not how
[1:08:44] brother brahman said discern we
[1:08:46] discerned by the spirit
[1:08:49] and brother brahm said something i'm
[1:08:50] still not done
[1:08:52] the man didn't say that i said that but
[1:08:54] brother brahms said he said when god
[1:08:56] pulls his change out of his pocket
[1:08:59] there's quarters in there when you pull
[1:09:00] change out there's quarters in there
[1:09:02] there's pennies in there there's nickels
[1:09:04] in there
[1:09:05] but it all has value
[1:09:08] you see we're always trying to get a
[1:09:10] quarter type level or a silver dollar
[1:09:12] level
[1:09:13] out of a penny
[1:09:16] and we're critical of them
[1:09:19] and we lose sleep over them why can't
[1:09:20] they do
[1:09:21] can't they be better
[1:09:23] well they might be only called to be a
[1:09:25] penny
[1:09:27] but i don't have a right to put them out
[1:09:29] of god's kingdom
[1:09:32] because they're only going to produce at
[1:09:34] the level the value that god has given
[1:09:35] them now i believe god's powerful enough
[1:09:37] that he can make a penny a quarter
[1:09:39] but i'm not big enough to do that
[1:09:42] i'm just the vessel i'm just the
[1:09:43] preacher to preach the word but i pray
[1:09:45] people rise higher but i'm it's wrong
[1:09:47] for me to condemn the pennies can you
[1:09:49] say man you know
[1:09:50] he said abraham was a silver dollar
[1:09:53] lot was a penny he said take a hundred
[1:09:56] pennies hundred lots to make an abraham
[1:09:59] now i know that looks like you're billy
[1:10:00] we're not villaining we're just saying
[1:10:02] he said in that message discernment of
[1:10:04] spirit he said
[1:10:06] don't
[1:10:07] judge a man
[1:10:09] by
[1:10:10] what he's part of
[1:10:11] or all that you're discerned by his
[1:10:14] spirit
[1:10:16] okay
[1:10:19] if he's not in all the word and he's
[1:10:22] be careful which direction you go with
[1:10:24] it
[1:10:25] you gotta discern
[1:10:26] where's their heart
[1:10:28] where's their motive we know if they're
[1:10:30] all caught up in a denomination and it's
[1:10:32] not the real thing and it's not the holy
[1:10:34] ghost we understand yes and so we just
[1:10:36] pray for that person but we still don't
[1:10:38] have a right to dishonor there was a
[1:10:41] statement made here that says they don't
[1:10:43] have nothing out there
[1:10:47] and i might have to cut this out but
[1:10:48] there was a preacher that made a
[1:10:49] statement here across the pulpit they
[1:10:51] don't have nothing out there
[1:10:54] i i don't believe in that it's right for
[1:10:56] us to say that
[1:10:58] okay
[1:10:59] i want to be careful which direction
[1:11:01] that goes and i know the brother meant
[1:11:03] it right
[1:11:04] but but i don't find that kind of
[1:11:06] expression coming from the prophet
[1:11:11] blast the systems of denominations blast
[1:11:13] preach the holy ghost to your people
[1:11:15] blast the jezebels can you say amen
[1:11:18] correct the jezebels who keep brother
[1:11:20] bram says a woman that puts a lot of
[1:11:22] makeup on shows she's empty inside these
[1:11:24] are truths that we hold this is exactly
[1:11:27] right
[1:11:28] and i'm going to preach them
[1:11:30] but personally we don't have a right to
[1:11:33] judge where a person's heart is at
[1:11:36] and brother madam's attitude you read it
[1:11:38] all the way to 65 he's going into places
[1:11:41] and preaching at places and he knows
[1:11:43] they're they're rejecting and heading
[1:11:45] out the door and leaving this word
[1:11:47] but his pulpit manner
[1:11:50] is praising what god has done in their
[1:11:53] lives
[1:11:55] you talk about honor
[1:11:58] one of the things that most affected me
[1:12:02] is when i watched
[1:12:04] after amy simple mcpherson angelus
[1:12:07] temple she's the head of it and the
[1:12:08] preacher of it and amy simple fearsome
[1:12:10] was a great healing evangelist a woman
[1:12:13] preacher
[1:12:15] and after she was gone
[1:12:17] this this has affected me and you go
[1:12:19] ahead and label me what you want to but
[1:12:20] this affected me he goes and he's asked
[1:12:22] to preach at her church and he spends
[1:12:25] 5 or 10 minutes
[1:12:27] honoring
[1:12:28] what god did in this woman's life and
[1:12:31] i'm going
[1:12:33] what
[1:12:35] she's wrong
[1:12:36] she's dead wrong
[1:12:38] and anybody who has the authority to
[1:12:39] correct it right there he has the
[1:12:41] authority to create right in her own
[1:12:42] church
[1:12:44] bless god
[1:12:47] you know why i got that attitude because
[1:12:49] i learned it from several preachers
[1:12:55] this doesn't represent some of the
[1:12:56] preachers that i've heard who would have
[1:12:58] went in and blasted the whole thing to
[1:13:00] kingdom come
[1:13:03] but he's praising her for five minutes
[1:13:05] said i went down and visited the grave
[1:13:06] and took my hat off and prayed and i
[1:13:08] thank god for her life
[1:13:13] you see it's not just the mysteries that
[1:13:15] i learned studying the message all these
[1:13:17] years it's the character of christ and
[1:13:20] the honor
[1:13:25] let's stand together
[1:13:28] an honor
[1:13:29] and respect
[1:13:31] is to be maintained from christians
[1:13:34] no matter what situation another person
[1:13:38] is in
[1:13:39] no matter how they would be treating you
[1:13:42] honor and respect is never to stop
[1:13:47] praise the lord you love him this
[1:13:48] morning
[1:13:49] lay your hands on somebody let's prank
