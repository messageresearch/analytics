[0:00] hi everybody Pastor Paul LaFontaine and
[0:02] literal Life Church in Petersburg
[0:04] Michigan would like to invite you to
[0:06] take the next half hour and enjoy some
[0:08] time in the word of God if you're hungry
[0:11] for more of Christ we believe you can be
[0:13] fed and we pray that you'll be blessed
[0:16] visit our website for more information
[0:18] at
[0:19] literallife.church may God bless you my
[0:21] friend and may the music and message
[0:23] encourage you today
[0:25] [Music]
[0:30] waking up another heavy heart and
[0:35] burdens I can't bear
[0:39] does anybody care
[0:46] see anymore
[0:49] [Music]
[0:59] so close when I'm in prayer
[1:04] that's when I close my eyes
[1:07] take some time to relax
[1:12] that he was always there
[1:15] the truth is he never
[1:18] [Music]
[1:20] that is what the spirit says
[1:23] [Music]
[1:47] and so much is on my mind
[1:52] [Music]
[1:57] don't deserve
[1:58] [Applause]
[2:00] this you know you know love you best
[2:03] open up so he can breathe again and put
[2:09] the storm to rain
[2:12] that's when I close my eyes I take some
[2:17] time and
[2:19] realize that he was always there
[2:24] truth is
[2:28] what the spirit says
[2:31] [Music]
[2:37] [Music]
[2:49] [Music]
[2:57] [Music]
[3:04] that's when I close my eyes and take
[3:08] some time and relax
[3:12] that he was always there
[3:15] and Truth is
[3:20] what the spirit says
[3:23] and I believe it's so I never have to be
[3:29] alone
[3:33] oh
[3:35] I never have to be alone
[3:46] then shall he sit upon the throne of his
[3:49] glory and before him shall be gathered
[3:52] all nations and he shall separate them
[3:54] one from another
[3:56] as a Shepherd divideth his sheep from
[3:58] the goats and he shall set the sheep on
[4:01] his right hand but the goats on the left
[4:04] then shall the king say unto them
[4:06] on his right hand Come Ye blessed of my
[4:10] father inherit the Kingdom prepared for
[4:13] you from the foundation of the world
[4:15] for I have a hungered hungered and ye
[4:18] gave me meat I was thirsty and you gave
[4:22] me drink I was a stranger and you took
[4:25] me in now notice Jesus is using this
[4:28] he's using the word I and as if he was
[4:32] the one that's hungered he's the ones
[4:34] that's thirsty in these conditions he's
[4:37] saying I was hungered you gave me me I
[4:39] was thirsty and you gave me a drink I
[4:42] was a stranger and you took me in naked
[4:44] and ye clothed me I was sick and you
[4:47] visited me I was in prison and you came
[4:50] unto me then shall the righteous answer
[4:53] him saying Lord when Saul we thee a
[4:57] hundred hungered and fed thee or thirsty
[4:59] and gave thee drink
[5:00] when saw we thee a stranger and took
[5:03] thee in or naked in clothe thee or when
[5:06] saw we thee sick or in prison and came
[5:09] unto thee and the King shall answer and
[5:12] say unto them verily I say unto you in
[5:15] so much as ye have done it unto one of
[5:18] the least of these my brethren
[5:22] ye have done it unto me after Sunday we
[5:26] we're very blessed to be able to see
[5:30] Mary Magdalene and to see the the
[5:34] special place that God gave Mary
[5:37] Magdalene
[5:38] and that special calling or that special
[5:41] place that he gave her kind of surprised
[5:44] us all I never looked at it that way
[5:45] maybe you had before but we were very
[5:48] blessed and very surprised to see who it
[5:51] was
[5:52] the least likely person at the end at
[5:57] the very closing hours of Jesus Earthly
[6:00] journey and just before the the
[6:02] Resurrection the least likely person at
[6:05] the end got to got the first view of his
[6:09] glory in the Resurrection the least
[6:11] likely person
[6:12] and uh it's not because that Mary
[6:15] Magdalene was better or it's not because
[6:18] she had a good past because she did not
[6:21] have a good past
[6:23] it's not because that she had done
[6:25] anything better than the disciples it's
[6:27] not because of any of her Merit it's not
[6:30] because of any of her background uh it
[6:33] wasn't because any of that it was just
[6:35] God's grace and God's mercy but it
[6:37] teaches us something that God is not a
[6:40] god of position and rank and how much
[6:43] you do or how little you do or we how
[6:47] many know that this gospel is not based
[6:50] upon how many works you do to gain
[6:52] entrance into the kingdom and God
[6:54] doesn't judge you according to your
[6:56] Works can you say man uh uh God does not
[7:00] look at things that way and this is an
[7:01] example that surprised us to see her to
[7:04] be able to view the glory of God as the
[7:06] first one in the resurrection not
[7:08] because she was better or she had a
[7:10] great past but I believe it was because
[7:12] she was just simply focused on the right
[7:15] thing
[7:16] Mary Magdalene in the closing hours of
[7:19] Jesus life was focused on the right
[7:22] thing and incidentally the other
[7:23] disciples were not focused on the right
[7:25] thing they were focused on their
[7:28] carnality they were focused on losing
[7:30] Jesus they weren't focused on the
[7:32] promise and I don't know how much
[7:34] Revelation that Mary had but she had
[7:36] enough of her that she wanted to stay
[7:38] close to the Lord stay close to his body
[7:40] even though he had already passed on as
[7:42] what we know it it was a lifeless body
[7:45] but she she was focused on the right
[7:47] thing and she was faithful to the right
[7:50] thing and she was staying close to the
[7:53] right thing I wonder if God looks at it
[7:55] that way it's not so much that we have a
[7:57] lot of Works to bring to him but that we
[7:59] in this closing hours and how many
[8:02] believe were in the closing hours of
[8:04] time
[8:04] that we would be focused on the correct
[8:07] thing that we would be faithful to the
[8:10] right thing that we would stay close to
[8:13] the right thing
[8:14] and to not judge ourselves someone was
[8:17] asking for prayer last week is that they
[8:19] continually be be beat up by the enemy
[8:21] and beat themselves up that I'm not
[8:23] doing enough and I don't seem to be
[8:25] enough doing enough to please the Lord
[8:26] and the devil's always doing that but in
[8:29] when it comes to God's grace friends God
[8:31] is not judging by our works but I wonder
[8:34] if it's just as simple as Mary Magdalene
[8:36] she just basically focused on the right
[8:38] thing at the right hour she was focused
[8:41] on the right thing how many would raise
[8:43] your hand this morning say God in these
[8:45] closing seconds of time don't let me be
[8:48] diverted by anything of this world don't
[8:50] let me try to work my way into heaven
[8:52] but Lord let me just be focused on the
[8:55] right thing and let me be faithful and
[8:57] consistent
[8:59] to you Lord
[9:01] even when it looks like the Lord's gone
[9:03] and it looks hopeless let me be faithful
[9:06] anyway can I get an amen even though it
[9:08] looks like that's why the other
[9:09] disciples they're disappointed I'm going
[9:11] back to my career I'm going back to this
[9:14] but there was something about hers even
[9:16] though his body was dead I'm gonna stay
[9:18] faithful to him I'm gonna stay close to
[9:21] him
[9:22] even though
[9:23] tragedy has happened in my life I'm
[9:25] gonna stay consistent with the Lord I'm
[9:28] gonna can you say my I'm gonna stay
[9:30] coming to church I'm gonna stay close to
[9:32] him
[9:33] even though I might not feel him right
[9:35] now I'm gonna stay close to him
[9:38] because when Jesus body was dead he
[9:40] couldn't touch her like he used to he
[9:42] couldn't lay his hands on her like like
[9:44] he used to it was a lifeless body but
[9:46] nevertheless something in her said
[9:48] listen he raised me up one day there was
[9:51] something in him that raised me out of
[9:52] my dirty life it raised me something
[9:55] Raised Me Up there's something about
[9:57] this man and even though he's dead I
[10:01] know there's resurrection power in that
[10:06] I want to stay close to the right thing
[10:08] like she did can you say Amen
[10:10] because if it could raise and raise her
[10:12] life out of sin that he could do more so
[10:15] the least of the followers of Jesus
[10:18] got written
[10:20] in the story of the Resurrection the
[10:22] least of the followers of Jesus
[10:25] got written in the story
[10:28] of the Resurrection I'll tell you don't
[10:30] let my name be in anything else
[10:33] except for let it be in the closing
[10:35] hours at Resurrection time let my name
[10:38] be attached to that and let me be in
[10:40] that Resurrection
[10:43] my name don't have to be in lights
[10:45] they're not anyway but my name don't
[10:47] have to go I don't care I don't have to
[10:48] be invited to another convention I'm
[10:51] perfectly happy just to preach the
[10:52] gospel here to my own people this
[10:54] morning and serve the Lord I am so happy
[10:57] to be here and just feeling this
[10:59] presence with you
[11:01] I don't need my name out I don't even
[11:03] know I just want my name attached to the
[11:05] Lord
[11:07] I want to be close to him
[11:10] so it's it's it's she was chosen the
[11:13] least of the followers how many of you
[11:14] kids or how many of you adults
[11:16] experience uh when the team got chosen
[11:19] brother Tom was just talking about this
[11:21] the other day when the team is lined up
[11:23] there and all the people are lined up
[11:25] and you're going to choose him it's kind
[11:27] of the worst way to do it to choose him
[11:30] out because somebody always ends up the
[11:32] last one
[11:33] and you can't help but judge there's a
[11:36] reason that they were chosen last
[11:39] they just don't have what it takes they
[11:41] don't have the talent so how many would
[11:43] say I'm one of those because I'm raising
[11:45] my hand right away I was the young
[11:47] redhead that was chosen last most the
[11:50] time so there's three or four of us come
[11:52] on be honest now
[11:54] and there's nothing worse than that
[11:56] feeling is that that that coach or that
[11:58] person goes through I'll take you and
[12:00] then the other team says I'll take you
[12:02] and I'll choose you I'll choose you and
[12:03] it's just going down and you're looking
[12:05] around going and it's becoming more
[12:07] lonely all the time
[12:10] and all of a sudden you're the last one
[12:12] there and you're you're chosen you are
[12:15] chosen but you're the last one chosen
[12:18] it's not fun
[12:21] but it's terrible but but the surprise
[12:25] in God's choosing
[12:28] is he picks the least
[12:31] first
[12:33] in God's kingdom he and I can show you
[12:36] other examples in scripture he he seems
[12:38] to choose the least uh the the least
[12:41] that would have the credibility for it
[12:43] or that would have the background for it
[12:45] or that would have what what they need
[12:47] for it that's when you're playing
[12:49] baseball or volleyball these different
[12:50] things you're being judged about your
[12:53] talent and so you're the last one to get
[12:54] chosen because you don't have what it
[12:56] takes like the other ones have and the
[12:58] coaches are choosing based upon I got to
[12:59] get this done so I'm choosing the very
[13:01] best of the best based on that but when
[13:03] we come into the kingdom of God then God
[13:05] looks at character God looks at what he
[13:07] needs God looks at somebody teachable
[13:09] and you can take somebody you don't have
[13:11] a clue about volleyball and you can
[13:13] start teaching them all of a sudden
[13:14] within a few months they can Excel
[13:16] everybody else in volleyball and
[13:18] surprise everybody but in the Kingdom he
[13:21] chooses even even though you would think
[13:24] think like you're the worst player
[13:26] even though you would think like you're
[13:28] the worst Christian
[13:30] the thing about it is is that this coach
[13:33] he sees your potential he sees what you
[13:37] will become
[13:39] and so
[13:41] we find this in other places in the
[13:43] Bible
[13:44] um related to the end time and I'm going
[13:47] to reference a couple of them today
[13:48] related to the end times related to the
[13:50] last closing hours we see very other
[13:53] examples where of God's choosing and
[13:56] also we see the least of the Brethren
[13:58] that's kind of my theme this morning
[13:59] finding him and the least of the
[14:01] brethren we find that at the end there's
[14:04] a choosing there's a there's a choosing
[14:06] the least of the brother of God
[14:07] emphasizing that and we find other
[14:09] places related to the end and so one of
[14:12] the one of them I'll reference right now
[14:14] and that's the parable of the wedding
[14:15] invitation given by the King Jesus talks
[14:18] about there was a king he sent out
[14:20] invitations to a wedding feast and so we
[14:23] we find that the who was chosen first as
[14:26] the normal people to be chosen the
[14:28] normal ones that get would get an
[14:30] invitation to this wedding and this
[14:31] wedding feast and so he sends out the
[14:33] invitation it's how Jesus said there was
[14:35] invitations that went out to the normal
[14:37] people and all of a sudden the normal
[14:40] people begin to make excuses
[14:43] it says I I too busy I can't come I've
[14:46] got this to do and I've got that to do
[14:48] and an invitation has come to this great
[14:49] way and it's a great privilege and honor
[14:52] to be invited to this king's Feast but
[14:54] and it used to be an honor to some of
[14:56] these people it used to be an honor to
[14:58] be invited to this King this is pretty
[15:00] important and so it used to be top
[15:02] priority but something happened in their
[15:05] lives that it's not a priority anymore I
[15:07] can take it or leave it it's at the
[15:09] bottom of the list now because their
[15:11] lives have become busy their life had
[15:14] become so busy where the invitation to
[15:17] the king's Feast was not quite as at the
[15:20] top of the priority as it used to be so
[15:23] the Bible says they all with one Accord
[15:25] begin to make excuses I have bought a
[15:29] piece of land I need to go view that I
[15:31] need to look at the closing papers I
[15:33] need to view that I just I can't make it
[15:35] I can't come I've got this another one
[15:38] says I've purchased a cow a big cow and
[15:41] I'm that's gonna bring beef for my
[15:42] family and it's going to be great for me
[15:44] and I've got to go and I've got that
[15:46] appointment set at that date so I'm not
[15:48] going to be able to make that invitation
[15:50] and they made an excuse of that and this
[15:52] is the subject now is is your life
[15:54] Worthy is your life deserving of the
[15:56] invitation is your life responding
[15:59] that's worthy of the imitation you're
[16:01] getting
[16:03] the third one made an excuse I have
[16:05] married a wife
[16:08] and he's really the only one that had
[16:11] an inch of a
[16:13] value to his excuse
[16:15] just kidding so you can see
[16:18] those three things kind of cover all the
[16:21] stuff that we can be distracted by
[16:24] a wife
[16:26] the busyness of
[16:28] getting the cow the business the
[16:30] purchase of a piece of land
[16:32] but in all that is perfectly fine okay
[16:37] but when it makes you turn down the
[16:39] invitation that's another story
[16:42] these parables are for the end time
[16:45] because why we're headed to a marriage
[16:47] feast
[16:49] he invites you to a feast a wedding
[16:50] feast and so now we've come to the word
[16:52] the full opening of the word he's
[16:54] invited you to a feast he's invited you
[16:56] to the full word and then there's a
[16:58] marriage supper of the Lamb this every
[17:00] time I preach I'm giving an invitation
[17:02] to you to come to this wedding feast
[17:05] every time I preach and it's a calling
[17:07] to you can you say Amen every time we
[17:09] meet together every time God you get in
[17:11] the word of God God is calling you he's
[17:13] inviting you can you say amen and so
[17:16] then what we have happened I've got to
[17:18] move along this story I've got a lot of
[17:19] hay on my fort today but you see now
[17:21] what happened is that the king said if
[17:23] they won't come he says I want you to go
[17:25] out I want you to get the lame the hall
[17:27] the sick all the ones out there that you
[17:30] can find and I want you to invite them
[17:32] those people to the wedding Feast
[17:34] because the rest of them wouldn't come
[17:36] so I want you to go out and get others
[17:38] that surprise surprise they wouldn't
[17:40] normally be invited to the feast but the
[17:43] king says I'm going to invite them
[17:45] because of the excuses of other people
[17:47] he said now I want you to go out into
[17:50] the highways into the byways I just want
[17:53] you to go out and make the invitation to
[17:55] them so a servants they go out and at
[17:58] least the least expected to be invited
[18:01] now God at the end time starts to call
[18:05] them
[18:06] because a bunch of others turned it down
[18:08] many
[18:10] every service you're being invited to
[18:12] the marriage supper of the Lamb
[18:14] some feel they don't need it that
[18:17] they're different they're under a
[18:18] different category
[18:20] all this is fine Brother Paul but I'm
[18:22] under different rules
[18:23] I don't need to RSVP
[18:26] to this
[18:28] oh yes you do
[18:31] so they made excuses
[18:33] and God begins to fill it it still was
[18:36] not enough so God says I want you to
[18:37] call and I want you to call and and all
[18:41] the the other people that rejected him
[18:43] all of a sudden these others from the
[18:45] highways and byways begin to come
[18:49] a reference another scripture of first
[18:51] Samuel 22 and verse 2 and these are the
[18:54] people in David's rejection who's a type
[18:57] of Christ in David's rejection as a king
[18:59] when all the normal people the normal
[19:01] Israel rejected him as king then this is
[19:05] what it says about the people that
[19:06] gather around him and everyone that was
[19:09] in distress and everyone that was in
[19:12] debt and everyone that was discontented
[19:15] gathered themselves together unto David
[19:18] and he became a captain over them and
[19:22] there were with him about 400 men
[19:30] First Corinthians 1 26 says for you see
[19:34] your calling Brethren how that many wise
[19:36] men after the flesh not many mighty not
[19:39] many noble are called
[19:41] but God hath chosen the foolish things
[19:45] of the world to confound the wise and
[19:48] God had chosen the weak things of the
[19:50] world to confound the things which are
[19:52] Mighty and base things of the world and
[19:55] things which are despised hath God
[19:58] chosen
[20:00] yea and things which are not to bring to
[20:03] not things that are that no flesh I'm
[20:06] going back to verse 27 but God hath
[20:08] chosen the foolish things in verse 26
[20:10] for you see your calling Brethren how
[20:13] that not many wise men after the flesh
[20:15] so in other words in our view of who
[20:17] should be called it's different than
[20:18] what God would choose not you said not
[20:21] many wise men after the flesh not many
[20:22] mighty not many noble are called and
[20:25] then you jump to the end verse 28 base
[20:28] things of the world things which are
[20:29] despised hath God chosen yea and things
[20:32] which are not to bring in not things
[20:34] that are that no flesh should glory in
[20:37] his presence
[20:39] there there is a a word of the Lord I
[20:42] believe for you today to realize that at
[20:44] the end at the end no flesh no talents
[20:48] no gifts no position will glory or take
[20:52] any Glory away from him he will choose
[20:56] based upon who he chooses and it will
[20:59] bring Glory only to him
[21:04] but who he chooses is a surprise to us
[21:08] sometimes
[21:10] it'll be by Revelation that they catch
[21:12] the parable the disciples ask him one
[21:14] day and says why do you speak in
[21:15] Parables and he gave the reason he says
[21:17] because I speak in Parables on some
[21:19] things because it is given to you to
[21:21] know the Mysteries so it's given to a
[21:24] certain group to catch it by Revelation
[21:26] so he doesn't throw it out there real
[21:27] plane he throws it in a parable because
[21:29] it can't come by just intellectual
[21:32] learning
[21:34] especially this mystery it cannot it
[21:37] will not come by intellectual so those
[21:39] are beating yourself up I don't have
[21:41] another knowledge of the scripture I'm
[21:42] not getting enough keep feeding on it
[21:44] keep reading on it can you say Amen but
[21:46] don't you ever judge yourself by how
[21:48] much you have knowledge of this because
[21:50] especially this mystery will not be
[21:53] based upon some intellectual capacity
[21:55] that you have it will be a soul
[21:58] Revelation once God thinks Rapture and
[22:02] the bride connects with that thought
[22:03] it's a done deal
[22:09] oh my glory be to God
[22:11] it's not based upon theological learning
[22:14] how much you know the message
[22:16] don't stop studying the message don't
[22:18] stop studying your Bible
[22:19] because it's good to get those things in
[22:21] your mind that can drop to your heart
[22:24] but he hides it because this will not be
[22:26] something that will be how much
[22:27] intellect you get through it this will
[22:29] be something different so he he puts it
[22:32] in Parables it's given unto you to know
[22:34] the mysteries of the Kingdom it's given
[22:36] but it's not given to some so that may
[22:39] be unfair to you but that's just the way
[22:41] it is because if God left it up to
[22:43] intellectual knowledge then anybody that
[22:46] was smarter than you could catch these
[22:48] things but it's not based upon intellect
[22:50] it's based upon Revelation and he's
[22:53] because if he didn't do that then a
[22:55] smarter person than you would make it in
[22:58] the Rapture before you you might not
[23:00] even make it it was based upon intellect
[23:02] as I've said if it was based upon who
[23:04] was smart probably not a lot of you
[23:07] would make it in the Rapture it was
[23:08] based upon those who are good looking I
[23:12] wouldn't even make it
[23:15] and you that are laughing wouldn't have
[23:16] made it either
[23:19] thank God this isn't based upon what
[23:22] clothes I wear or how beautiful I look
[23:24] or how much intellect I have or how
[23:27] disciplined into my life thank God this
[23:30] is not based upon how disciplined in I
[23:32] am in my Christian walk thank God it's
[23:34] not based upon that thank God I find one
[23:37] of the most confusing things that Satan
[23:38] still confusing people over is the new
[23:40] birth
[23:41] and the Holy Ghost
[23:44] I I want people to be able to understand
[23:47] because Satan does his job
[23:49] to confuse people about it God is not
[23:53] the author of confusion
[23:56] that there's such even till today
[23:59] such different Slants on the new birth
[24:04] and what the Holy Ghost is and the
[24:06] evidence sometimes people preachers will
[24:08] preach and if you do this then you'll
[24:10] then you have the Holy Ghost and it
[24:11] becomes a sanctification thing and we
[24:13] need to preach the balanced word of God
[24:17] for the people's sake for the young
[24:19] people's sake
[24:21] how many want to know what the Holy
[24:22] Ghost is
[24:23] how many want the holy ghost in your
[24:25] life without a shadow of a doubt God
[24:27] bless you God bless you I mean you pray
[24:29] you'd say Lord and you got evidences of
[24:32] you in your life praise the Lord say God
[24:34] and then you that have it say I want
[24:36] more of it see the thing is friends God
[24:38] doesn't just make it confusing to us
[24:40] that we're always in this I'm lacking
[24:42] I'm lacking I'm lacking no it's just
[24:43] whatever we do like just keep going
[24:46] before God and say Lord whatever I lack
[24:48] fill me with it
[24:50] if it is the holy spirit fill me with it
[24:52] let me be obedient to you
[24:55] make me ready Lord we're living in a
[24:58] time that people are coming and there's
[25:01] there's situations people share with me
[25:03] that I'm overwhelmed sometimes to the
[25:06] the the damage that Satan has done to
[25:09] the emotions and the people's lives
[25:11] there isn't anybody even sitting here
[25:14] that's had a perfect background had a
[25:17] perfect family
[25:19] spoke on betrayal there isn't anybody
[25:22] that hasn't been betrayed by somebody
[25:24] you will be betrayed but it's not about
[25:26] that it's about what you're going to do
[25:28] with it
[25:30] but we're having broken people come to
[25:32] us and guess what I'm one of them you're
[25:34] one of them and the quicker we can quit
[25:36] judging people on the other side and say
[25:38] I'm coming broken they're coming broken
[25:42] the quicker we can see what our calling
[25:44] is
[25:47] these people are coming naked and
[25:49] destitute and bound by addictions and
[25:51] bound by things and under depression
[25:55] can't beat somebody up from that but I
[25:58] can tell you this I can tell you this if
[26:00] that's who's coming if that's the last
[26:02] group there's a there's a there's a
[26:05] bride
[26:07] who has eternal life
[26:12] she has the answer
[26:15] and there isn't any addiction there
[26:17] isn't anything that you went through in
[26:19] your past or present there is anything
[26:21] plague in your mind that is too big for
[26:25] the message that I'm preaching and the
[26:26] power of God that's available there
[26:28] isn't anything too big for it to do we
[26:30] need to let God do what he wants to do
[26:33] and not pull it our way just let God do
[26:37] what he wants to do let him do his work
[26:39] and that might be a very exuberant
[26:41] emotional service but it might be just a
[26:43] quiet service when God dropped some real
[26:46] solid bombs on the enemy can you say man
[26:49] and some Revelations Into the Heart of
[26:52] the people that overcoming power is
[26:54] going to make them stand their sons and
[26:55] doctors
[26:57] of God don't ever stop entering into
[26:58] worship remember the Bible says the
[27:00] sacrifice of praise
[27:02] so you need to come and bring the sacred
[27:03] it's the sacrifice work out all that
[27:05] tiredness and work out all that thing
[27:07] all the week has been a rough week you
[27:09] come and the song leaders gotta come you
[27:12] know he's singing and pulling sometimes
[27:14] he shouldn't have to do that you should
[27:15] say this is my time to Worship the Lord
[27:17] and you should enter in sometimes you
[27:20] shout sometimes a person just sits and
[27:22] cries sometimes they just Ponder don't
[27:24] look to the next person and try to copy
[27:26] the next person just yield to the Lord
[27:28] and worship him we don't have to work
[27:31] anything up because eternal life is
[27:33] working through the word of God and the
[27:34] new birth of the people and he can come
[27:36] and deliver somebody in a moment's time
[27:39] without any emotion involved
[27:41] I'll say this too that we must be
[27:43] careful how we misdirect our young
[27:44] people sometimes because someone who's
[27:46] crying for God might think that if I get
[27:49] it I have to get it like that person
[27:51] over there that's just screaming and
[27:54] shouting they may be getting the genuine
[27:56] thing but you should never feel like I
[27:58] have to do that in order to get
[28:00] something real we have to be so careful
[28:03] of that because he got sincere Hearts
