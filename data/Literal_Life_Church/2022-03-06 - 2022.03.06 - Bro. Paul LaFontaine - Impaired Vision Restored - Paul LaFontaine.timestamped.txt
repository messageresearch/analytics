[0:00] and verse 22
[0:04] and he cometh to bethesda
[0:08] and they bring a blind man unto him and
[0:10] besought him to touch him
[0:13] and he took the blind man by the hand
[0:16] and he led him out of the town
[0:19] and when he had spit on his eyes and put
[0:22] his hands upon him
[0:25] he asked him if he saw ought so we know
[0:28] there was another incident where jesus
[0:31] spit on some mud and clay and put it in
[0:33] the eyes
[0:34] and i don't know all the science behind
[0:36] this and i don't know i would have to
[0:38] research it to see what was happening
[0:40] but it doesn't matter how the lord does
[0:42] it
[0:43] as long as it gets the results
[0:47] okay that seems
[0:48] kind of dirty to do something like that
[0:51] but this is what he did he spit in the
[0:53] man's eyes and then he touched his eyes
[0:55] and then he asked him i want you to
[0:57] notice now he asked him if he saw all
[0:59] and he looked up and he said
[1:01] i see men as trees walking
[1:04] so his his vision had cleared up a bit
[1:08] but it wasn't perfectly clear yet it
[1:12] just was
[1:13] it was still impaired
[1:15] and so he's seen more but he's seen men
[1:18] as trees
[1:19] and after that he put his hands again
[1:22] upon his eyes
[1:24] and made him look up
[1:26] and he was restored
[1:28] and saw every man
[1:31] clearly
[1:33] and we can say amen
[1:35] i'd like to speak this morning on
[1:38] impaired vision
[1:39] restored
[1:43] heavenly father
[1:45] we are
[1:46] standing dependent on you this morning
[1:50] and there's only one great one among us
[1:52] lord and that's you
[1:54] we're aware that you're here among us
[1:56] and we we welcome you
[1:58] we've invited you but it's not just that
[2:00] we invite you we welcome you
[2:03] lord you have your place in our hearts
[2:05] today you have your sway with us we
[2:08] trust you lord that you will give us
[2:11] a word from you that would be beneficial
[2:14] to help us
[2:15] along this journey
[2:17] lord because you know all things there
[2:19] isn't anything hidden from you you know
[2:22] our background you know our trials you
[2:24] know wherever we've been
[2:26] we know what god is to this place today
[2:30] and lord because of that we can trust
[2:32] you as a mighty god
[2:34] that if you know our past so clearly
[2:38] then you must know our future too
[2:42] and lord we remember in the prayer lines
[2:44] of the prophet where
[2:46] by vision you could take a man and he
[2:48] could see a person in the doctor's
[2:51] office and a person
[2:53] when they were a child and
[2:54] different incidences that there was no
[2:56] way that a man could know that but you
[2:58] knew it you knew every incident
[3:00] everything and you showed the prophet by
[3:02] vision
[3:04] and lord often the prophet would say
[3:06] don't you think that the god that knows
[3:08] your past and can tell me those things
[3:10] is the same god
[3:11] that knows your future
[3:13] and sees you healed in the name of the
[3:16] lord jesus christ so lord it it it just
[3:20] settles our hearts this morning and we
[3:21] pray that you'll take us that you'll
[3:23] move upon us lord and it shall teach us
[3:25] your ways
[3:26] lord may it be more than an intellectual
[3:28] exercise
[3:30] but lord may lives be transformed by
[3:32] your holy spirit that's here
[3:34] lord
[3:36] may barriers be broken down
[3:38] lord may deliverance come to all of us
[3:41] lord
[3:42] for we need your help at this time
[3:45] lord if someone's feeling shaky from the
[3:47] times that we live in i pray that the
[3:49] peace that passes all understanding
[3:52] would come to their hearts today
[3:54] lord we remember our ukrainian brothers
[3:57] and sisters the russian brothers and
[3:58] sisters all the ukrainian people all of
[4:01] that country lord we remember in prayer
[4:05] lord you hand would guide it we know
[4:08] that prophecy is no doubt being
[4:09] fulfilled but lord watch over
[4:12] put your people into your wings lord i
[4:14] pray and bring this them through this we
[4:17] commit them to you we commit our lives
[4:19] to you and we're glad to be here
[4:21] fellowshipping together
[4:23] to be in the right place at the right
[4:25] time
[4:26] in jesus name we ask him amen amen shake
[4:29] somebody's hand and before you're seated
[4:31] and greet them in the name of the lord
[4:35] amen
[4:40] this
[4:43] text about jesus healing a blind man
[4:48] at this particular part
[4:52] about jesus
[4:54] touching him again it just moves me
[4:58] to see that
[5:01] jesus
[5:02] would not leave
[5:04] this man
[5:06] with a partial vision
[5:08] there's something about jesus that
[5:12] and you know this the scripture that
[5:14] says
[5:15] he
[5:16] who hath begun a good work in you
[5:18] will be faithful to complete the work
[5:21] and what i find is if there's a lot of
[5:24] stuff in between that
[5:27] then god can pick it up again and god
[5:29] when he all he has to do is touch the
[5:31] situation again can you say man
[5:36] but it moves me that he he touched him
[5:38] again and so we could safely say that if
[5:42] you're not fully restored
[5:44] jesus can touch you again
[5:47] if your heart was touched by jesus as a
[5:50] child
[5:51] he can touch you again
[5:54] if you had a good beginning with the
[5:56] lord
[5:57] and a lot of stuff has happened since
[5:59] then i'm here to tell you this morning
[6:02] he can touch you again
[6:03] [Applause]
[6:05] if you had eyesight to see clearly maybe
[6:08] when you were young and you got blinded
[6:10] by the things of the world or blinded by
[6:13] false teaching or blinded by anything
[6:15] else if you had good eyesight but
[6:17] something happened to blind you i'm here
[6:20] to tell you he christ can touch your
[6:22] eyes again
[6:24] how many believe that this morning
[6:25] [Applause]
[6:29] it's the eyes it's the eyes in this
[6:31] incident that he was touching because of
[6:33] the blindness of this man it's the eyes
[6:35] he was touching and i want you to ponder
[6:37] that it was the eyes because the eyes in
[6:39] the scripture have a lot of references
[6:41] of course when he came he was physically
[6:43] healing blindness but the eyes
[6:46] the one scripture says is the gate to
[6:48] the soul the eyes is a very important
[6:50] thing not just naturally but also
[6:53] spiritually as well and most the time in
[6:54] scripture when he speaks of the eyes
[6:56] he's speaking of a spiritual perception
[6:59] to be able to see christ clearly to be
[7:01] able to see prophecy clary uh
[7:03] you know there's a message called
[7:05] moderate events made clear by prophecy
[7:09] that means god wants to make it clear
[7:11] spiritually to you what's happening in
[7:13] world events today god makes wants to
[7:15] make it clear it may not be clear to
[7:18] politicians but to believers it's clear
[7:22] we look this is our glasses we look
[7:24] through the eyes of the word can you say
[7:26] amen that's why we're not afraid this
[7:28] morning that's not why that's why we're
[7:30] not scared can you say about that's why
[7:32] we're at peace because we're not looking
[7:33] through the eyes of politicians and
[7:35] trying to figure it out we're looking
[7:37] through a word that's already prophesied
[7:39] things to take place
[7:41] spiritual eyesight is an important thing
[7:43] and so now here jesus opens up the
[7:45] blinded eyes and i wanted to ask you do
[7:48] you believe that jesus can do this again
[7:50] do you believe that jesus can open up
[7:53] the blinded eyes
[7:56] he did it back then and nobody has a
[7:58] right to say he can't do it again
[8:00] we have people suffering in the church
[8:02] with some blindness i'm still believing
[8:04] god's going to open their eyes
[8:06] i believe if he could do it then he can
[8:07] do it now
[8:09] but you see now we see that's we we
[8:11] believe that he can do that i've
[8:13] actually seen it as a young child i was
[8:15] in a service and god blessed me to be
[8:17] able to see a man who went blind and uh
[8:20] some of the people in this assembly were
[8:21] there if that service i was just a boy
[8:23] but i'm so glad god will allow me to see
[8:25] i know this can happen i believe god can
[8:27] do it i believe he can raise the dead i
[8:29] believe he can heal cancer i believe he
[8:31] can heal any disease i believe god can
[8:33] do anything still today i believe god is
[8:36] able and there's nothing impossible for
[8:38] god to do he hasn't changed
[8:40] but you see now when i was a little boy
[8:42] there was a man that went blind in the
[8:43] church i don't know how long he had been
[8:45] completely blind but i was privileged to
[8:47] see the minister lay hands on him that
[8:49] he struck a dance there and he shouted
[8:52] around the entire building
[8:54] quite a few times that afternoon his
[8:56] eyes were completely open and i was i
[8:58] was down in the front when the minister
[9:00] said i was as a young boy looking up i
[9:02] watched his eyes come open and him take
[9:05] off and run around the church i can tell
[9:06] you god can heal the blinded eyes
[9:10] i'm so
[9:11] glad but you know blessed is he who's
[9:13] not seeing yet believes blessed is he if
[9:15] you haven't seen that god wants you to
[9:17] believe anyway
[9:19] he's able to do it but i want to say
[9:21] this this morning the worst kind of
[9:23] blindness is spiritual blindness
[9:27] i said the worst blindness is spiritual
[9:30] blindness
[9:32] the worst kind of blindness is spiritual
[9:34] blindness or to be spiritually
[9:37] your vision spiritually impaired
[9:40] by something that you can't see clearly
[9:43] and more importantly you can't see
[9:45] christ clearly
[9:48] you can't see christ clearly
[9:50] and if you have that condition i i
[9:53] believe jesus can touch your eyes just
[9:55] as he touched this man's eyes if you if
[9:58] your spiritual vision is impaired i
[10:00] believe god can touch your eyes and you
[10:02] can see everything clear and the best
[10:04] thing you can see claire is to see jesus
[10:07] and it's amazing now that this man he
[10:09] had a touch he had the the spit that
[10:12] come in his eyes and jesus rubbed his
[10:14] eyes and then jesus touched him and he
[10:17] could see better but it wasn't totally
[10:19] clear yet
[10:21] and he said that he's seen men jesus
[10:24] said how's your eyes now how is your
[10:25] vision now
[10:27] and he said i can see a little better
[10:29] because i can see but the men
[10:31] looked like trees
[10:34] and
[10:36] the lord said well
[10:38] it's not completely done yet
[10:42] the lord didn't walk away and leave him
[10:44] with a fuzzy vision
[10:48] and he won't do that this morning
[10:52] praise the lord
[10:54] he didn't say well that's that's that's
[10:56] that's going to be if that's good enough
[10:58] he didn't say that's good enough he said
[11:00] i need to touch this man again because
[11:02] god's interested in him having a a
[11:04] completely clear vision and so he's seen
[11:06] men because because
[11:09] first of all this might just be
[11:10] practical but seeing men as trees is not
[11:13] normal
[11:16] okay
[11:16] you don't want to leave a man like that
[11:18] where he's seeing men as trees
[11:20] if he sees them as trees
[11:23] just if he sees men just like trees
[11:27] he might chop him down someday
[11:32] i wonder
[11:33] if impaired vision
[11:37] causes us not to see
[11:39] people
[11:40] right amen
[11:43] amen
[11:46] i wonder if impaired vision
[11:49] either from our past
[11:51] or from our past hurts our past pains i
[11:56] wonder if it can impair how we look at
[11:59] people
[12:02] i wonder if it causes us to not see
[12:04] people right
[12:05] and even see people within the church
[12:08] correctly
[12:11] i'm prepared for to get quiet right now
[12:14] as i talk about these things
[12:16] i wonder if is that that why we get so
[12:20] incredibly angry at people sometimes
[12:23] i wonder if that's why when someone does
[12:25] you wrong
[12:27] and you say you never you're never or
[12:29] ever going to speak to them again i know
[12:32] none of you have ever said that before
[12:33] but there are people that say they did
[12:35] me wrong they're finished that's done
[12:38] i'm never going to speak to them again
[12:40] i wonder if it causes
[12:42] it it's the cause that you don't see
[12:45] them as flawed human beings with a soul
[12:49] like you but you see them as something
[12:51] other than that this man seen men as
[12:53] trees and i'm trying to show that that's
[12:56] a type i wonder if impaired vision
[12:58] causes us not to see people right
[13:04] to not see them as a flawed human being
[13:07] with a soul
[13:08] like you because you're a flawed human
[13:11] being
[13:13] amen
[13:15] only by the grace of god in his blood
[13:17] that we can call ourselves perfect
[13:19] it's only through his eyes can you say
[13:21] amen
[13:22] and i'm interested in seeing myself
[13:24] through his eyes not the eyes of you not
[13:26] the eyes of myself but through god's
[13:28] vision and it's only through the blood
[13:30] of jesus christ that brother adam says
[13:33] when he looks at you he doesn't see your
[13:35] past he doesn't see what you've done he
[13:37] doesn't see your flaws he sees you
[13:39] through the blood of jesus christ and
[13:41] that's the only way he can see you
[13:42] perfect
[13:45] that's a clear vision can you say amen
[13:48] hallelujah
[13:50] and that's why the first time that jesus
[13:52] looked to somebody
[13:54] through
[13:55] his eyes with blood coming down the
[13:57] first time he looked at somebody through
[14:00] the blood
[14:01] he said
[14:03] you'll be saved today
[14:06] because he said remember me when you
[14:07] come into paradise and he said today
[14:10] you'll be with me in paradise
[14:12] never been baptized never had a chance
[14:14] to do all that that's how powerful it is
[14:16] when jesus looks through his blood
[14:19] that's how he sees the individual
[14:23] amen
[14:24] and i believe friends that we don't see
[14:26] people right sometimes and we don't see
[14:28] them as uh the way we should see them
[14:31] because of impaired visions we we see
[14:34] them we don't see them as faulty a
[14:36] flawed human being with a soul and if we
[14:38] don't see them correctly then we see
[14:40] people i don't know as monsters or or
[14:42] robots he's seen him as trees but we see
[14:45] people as monsters the person who did
[14:47] remo wrong or robots or morons or
[14:51] jerks i don't know what terms you have
[14:53] for it or just some tree to cut down
[14:55] eventually
[14:57] and so i would say to you that our
[14:59] vision is impaired our vision is clouded
[15:02] can you say a man
[15:03] and not only and i'll speak of this not
[15:05] only as our vision impaired of christ
[15:07] sometimes but because our vision of
[15:10] christ is impaired we don't see him
[15:12] right then we don't see other people
[15:14] right now i'm going to just read a
[15:15] couple things to you because in the
[15:17] message standing in the gap um
[15:20] brother branham our prophet went through
[15:22] something after during the seals and
[15:24] just after that and he didn't bring it
[15:26] out clearly and confess it until
[15:28] standing in the gap and by cause confess
[15:30] i mean he was being honest about
[15:32] something he was going through
[15:33] internally and that is he built up a
[15:35] complex he said
[15:36] people he was preaching things the
[15:38] people weren't listening to him they
[15:39] were continuing on getting worse and
[15:40] worse when he went into certain areas
[15:42] but he kept preaching but it was
[15:43] building a complex that he said you know
[15:45] what i'm tired of this you know what i
[15:47] did something in him was was giving up
[15:49] something made his complex say i'm just
[15:51] not going to go anymore i'm going to
[15:52] give up i'm going to go up north i'm
[15:53] going to become a trapper i'm getting
[15:55] ready to leave i won't tell my wife
[15:56] we'll just do it at the top of the hat
[15:57] we'll jump in the car and go i'm
[15:58] finished with ministry and all this was
[16:00] building up because because he had built
[16:03] up a complex and when he comes to stand
[16:05] in the gap he confesses that god had to
[16:08] correct him about his feeling of the
[16:10] people god had to correct him because
[16:12] i'll say it this way he was not viewing
[16:15] these rebellious people correctly
[16:17] he could not help them if he viewed them
[16:20] the wrong way
[16:24] amen and he says in that message if you
[16:26] guys pull up the quote and these
[16:28] rickey's and ricketts because that's
[16:30] what he called them these ricky's and
[16:31] raketas that have so sassed the words
[16:34] and i've called them ricky and ricketta
[16:36] god give me to understand i shouldn't do
[16:38] that because that's many of them are
[16:40] still his children
[16:42] they can't help because they act so much
[16:44] different some of these old cold formal
[16:47] churches has got them that spirit upon
[16:49] them and they're in much they're in much
[16:52] in prison as israel was in prison just
[16:54] as much as moses went down to deliver
[16:56] them from slavery human beings that love
[16:59] jesus christ would serve him if they
[17:02] only know what to serve him by and
[17:04] they're in bondage under
[17:06] denominationalism that tells them don't
[17:08] do this and don't do that and what he
[17:10] means by that is it's just a religion
[17:12] don't do this don't do this and you're
[17:14] fine come to church sign shake the
[17:16] preacher's hand sign our membership card
[17:19] dress yourself up with some holiness
[17:21] churches if we can just get them dressed
[17:22] up on the outside and make them wear the
[17:24] right thing then you're a member you're
[17:25] good everything's fine that's religion
[17:27] that's not the power of the holy ghost
[17:29] come on i should get more amens to that
[17:31] it's denominationalism that says if you
[17:34] do this and do this and don't do this
[17:35] and know this you're saved it's fine
[17:37] you're going in a rapture i say that's a
[17:38] lie we don't want religion we want the
[17:41] power of the holy spirit to change our
[17:43] desires
[17:47] we're not about making the message even
[17:49] a religion here
[17:51] even though god has given us more
[17:53] specifics how a believer should live but
[17:55] it has to come through true salvation a
[17:58] heart that says i need you i can't go
[18:00] anywhere else i cry out i humble my
[18:03] pride god forgive me of my sins and
[18:05] start with salvation and then say lord
[18:08] after i'm baptized fill me with the holy
[18:10] spirit
[18:13] there isn't no back door to all of this
[18:18] there isn't no i was raised in it and
[18:20] then i'm okay because i'm raised in it
[18:21] there isn't anything like that
[18:25] to come up some other way and say i'm
[18:27] okay because my parents were in the
[18:28] message you need salvation you need a a
[18:32] a experience with christ yourself and
[18:34] you need the holy spirit and that'll
[18:36] change your desires towards the things
[18:38] of god in the word you'll be in the word
[18:39] because you crave the word of god
[18:42] and the things of the world become
[18:44] strangely dim when you're seeing jesus
[18:46] right
[18:48] am i being real with you amen
[18:52] they they take these souls and they're
[18:54] in slavery because denomination that
[18:56] tells them don't do this and don't do
[18:57] that but the call of god must come the
[19:00] call in a person's life must come
[19:03] through him becoming real to the person
[19:09] there was another place he says here at
[19:11] standing in the gap and i wanted his
[19:13] prayer at the end
[19:15] god bless you each one
[19:16] and we hope to see you again real soon
[19:18] till then will you do this one favor for
[19:21] me now both here and on the tapes also
[19:23] my brother pray that god will place into
[19:26] my heart that something that i lost out
[19:29] there in that complex it's so easy to
[19:33] build a complex
[19:35] later on he says yeah
[19:37] don't lose the feeling of the people
[19:40] he's admitting
[19:42] that even as a holy ghost believer even
[19:44] as a prophet
[19:46] he had lost his feeling
[19:48] for the people
[19:53] and i think if a prophet can go through
[19:55] that and god have to correct him
[19:57] and he gets impaired vision because he's
[19:59] not seeing these people right
[20:01] if a prophet went through that i know
[20:03] that we do
[20:06] come on come on all you holy people
[20:08] raise your hand
[20:09] i know that we do it if a prophet can do
[20:12] it
[20:12] i'm not here to belittle the prophet or
[20:15] put him down i'm gonna say he's real
[20:16] about his mistakes he's real about what
[20:18] he goes through and even a believer can
[20:20] get impaired vision and not see people
[20:23] right
[20:25] he's seen people men as trees just trees
[20:28] but they're not trees and i love this
[20:30] last statement in his he said don't lose
[20:32] the feeling of people see you must
[20:33] remember they're not made out of stock
[20:36] sawdust they are flesh and blood human
[20:39] beings and a soul amen
[20:42] amen
[20:43] can i go further amen so not seeing
[20:46] things as well as god would like to you
[20:49] to see people is an important thing to
[20:51] god god touched his eyes and he looked
[20:53] at those ricky rickies different than he
[20:56] ever looked at him before he had more
[20:58] grace in his heart he had more prayer in
[20:59] his heart he had more uh a ministry in
[21:02] his heart to say i'm looking at these
[21:04] people wrong and it's making him
[21:05] withdraw himself because he's not
[21:08] looking at him they're just ricky's they
[21:10] they've sown their last seed they're
[21:11] finished and none of us have a right to
[21:14] say anybody's finished not even a
[21:16] prophet
[21:19] his attitude had changed he's still a
[21:21] believer but his attitude his vision had
[21:23] become impaired and it's like these guys
[21:25] are just rebellious and they i come and
[21:27] preach the word and they do the opposite
[21:29] they get worse and worse every year that
[21:30] i come and his heart began to just kind
[21:33] of write him off
[21:34] amen amen his vision become impaired
[21:39] god and his grace had to come
[21:43] do correction surgery
[21:46] on his eyesight
[21:48] amen
[21:49] amen
[21:51] seeing things right seeing god's people
[21:54] right
[21:55] seeing jesus right is crucial
[22:00] it's easy to see where the prophet was
[22:02] corrected on this but what about us what
[22:04] about our impaired vision of people this
[22:06] morning
[22:07] we think sometimes we're so much better
[22:09] than everyone else
[22:11] the bible says everyone is righteous in
[22:13] their own eyes
[22:16] everyone is doing good it's interesting
[22:18] when we give our testimony and give our
[22:20] where we're at we most of the time come
[22:22] out smelling like a rose
[22:24] not that bad of a person i'm not that
[22:26] you see but we need people to be honest
[22:28] about where they're at
[22:29] the same is honest god is honest about
[22:32] us can you say amen he'll give us the
[22:34] true diagnosis and when you get to the
[22:36] truth then you can be free because the
[22:37] bible says ye shall know the truth and
[22:39] the truth will set you free if you cover
[22:41] over and say i'm a good person on the
[22:43] inside i would do this and i would give
[22:45] to the ukrainians and i would do that
[22:47] and i would do that but i'm not going to
[22:49] talk to those other believers in my own
[22:50] church but i'll give to all these other
[22:52] needs strangers that you don't know
[22:54] praise the lord god bless you for it but
[22:56] it's interesting to me that you would
[22:57] give to strangers like that and can't
[22:59] even fellowship with your own
[23:00] congregation
[23:01] [Applause]
[23:03] can't have communion with your own local
[23:05] congregation
[23:08] i'll go on and read some more he says in
[23:10] another place here uh in a message here
[23:13] on the road not long ago coming up from
[23:14] a trip in the mountains someone was said
[23:16] here take these glasses and look over
[23:18] here a certain thing well i picked up
[23:20] the glasses i saw three or four
[23:21] different objects now you see i know
[23:24] that there was something wrong with that
[23:25] see now this antelope standing in the
[23:27] field there seemed to be three or four
[23:28] of them standing there but what it was
[23:30] the antelope was just perfectly one
[23:32] antelope
[23:33] the the glass was all right what i had
[23:35] to do was to draw that focus till i got
[23:38] all three of the antelopes into one and
[23:41] made one antelope see later on he says
[23:43] we don't need an organization i have
[23:45] nothing against them but the damage that
[23:47] they do to pull people out and separate
[23:49] brotherhood and things but we only need
[23:52] to look at one thing and that's our
[23:54] substitute that's right that substitute
[23:56] is jesus christ
[23:58] in this message he goes back to cain and
[24:00] abel he talks about wars he talks about
[24:02] jealousy how all this started was a
[24:04] jealousy from cain to abel because abel
[24:07] had the right sacrifice cain did not
[24:09] have the right one and jealousy started
[24:11] up and that's how he killed him and
[24:12] murdered him all wars start with
[24:14] jealousy all wars come because there's
[24:16] something wrong in the heart of man
[24:19] and he says that happened because abel
[24:21] had the right sacrifice it was a blood
[24:23] sacrifice it wasn't something he
[24:24] concocted himself he said that's our
[24:27] problem today that's why we have
[24:28] division today that's why we have fusses
[24:30] with one another that's why we have
[24:32] things that and men just draw inside
[24:33] themselves that's why we have
[24:35] denominations that's why the devil's
[24:36] always trying to fight to divide the
[24:38] people of god and it all starts with
[24:40] jealousies and not seeing jesus right
[24:43] not seeing our sacrifice at calvary and
[24:46] if we would all focus to one thing
[24:48] seeing jesus right then all that
[24:50] division starts to go away
[24:52] [Music]
[24:54] we knew we don't need an organization i
[24:55] have nothing against that the damage
[24:57] that you do to pull people out and
[24:58] separate brotherhood and things but we
[25:00] only need to look at one thing and
[25:02] that's our substitute that's right and
[25:03] that substitute is jesus christ aren't
[25:05] you glad you got a substitute this
[25:07] morning
[25:08] and then today you see how we twist it
[25:09] out in organizations and they say the
[25:11] mess of this is having a revival of
[25:12] course that don't mean the baptist
[25:14] that's the methodist and they're having
[25:16] a revival and so forth and they cut the
[25:17] other fella out all the time but we
[25:20] don't want to see it that way we want to
[25:22] keep pulling that focus till we find out
[25:25] that there's one god when you see three
[25:27] of them out there you better focus the
[25:28] glass a little better you're seeing
[25:30] something wrong you better bring it in
[25:32] and find out that there's one god over
[25:35] us all and he's the god of the human
[25:38] race
[25:39] and he if he's if he's got it all he's
[25:43] interested in every human being because
[25:45] it's his creation
[25:47] and he's interested in the children he's
[25:50] interested in the old age and the middle
[25:52] age he's interested in the color in the
[25:54] colors of us the white the brown the
[25:56] black the yellow and the different
[25:57] shades of our skin from the country that
[25:59] we come from of our forefather he's
[26:01] interested in all of us he's just not
[26:03] interested in the jews alone or the
[26:05] yellow race or black race of white rice
[26:07] whatever it is he's interested in the
[26:09] whole human race and trying to get the
[26:12] human race to focus his word down to one
[26:15] thing and say
[26:18] there's no racism in the spirit of the
[26:20] lord amen
[26:21] there's no prejudice in the spirit of
[26:23] the lord
[26:24] can you say amen
[26:26] there's no looking at some man that has
[26:28] a soul and looking down on him
[26:31] he has the potential
[26:33] to receive god
[26:36] and that's the way we should look at him
[26:40] and we would say well he'll never
[26:42] receive it
[26:43] they left so they they shot their last
[26:46] while they're finished
[26:48] we don't have a right to say that
[26:50] because my god is real
[26:53] your god is real
[26:56] don't write them off and say that's
[26:58] that's you know i don't have to
[27:00] uh minister to that person because
[27:01] they're they
[27:03] we can't do that we have to see it right
[27:05] and he's interested in the whole
[27:07] human race
[27:12] all lives matter
[27:14] amen
[27:15] amen
[27:17] all souls matter to god
[27:27] praise the lord
[27:28] that's what man has tried to do down
[27:30] through the years is trying to get the
[27:32] other fella out of the way when we ought
[27:34] to bring try to be bringing the other
[27:36] fella in the way with him and be a
[27:38] brother you see instead of trying to say
[27:40] oh that little group just rake them out
[27:42] and this over here oh well they are this
[27:44] and that and we label people we put
[27:46] people in categories and we label them
[27:49] out and and all this is be coming
[27:51] because we're not focused to see jesus
[27:54] right
[27:55] i know this might be a simple message to
[27:57] some of you believers but i'm doing it
[27:59] anyway because it's still a problem even
[28:03] in some of our ranks
[28:04] if there's problems like we have
[28:06] sometimes it's because you're not seeing
[28:08] jesus right
[28:11] and this message reveals jesus christ
[28:13] it's so that we can see jesus not
[28:16] through the lens of a denominational
[28:17] creed and dogma but to see jesus clearly
[28:20] and when we see him clearly without the
[28:22] without the cloudiness of our past
[28:24] without the cloudiness of how somebody
[28:26] has hurt us but we say lord forgive me
[28:28] and let me forgive them as they forgive
[28:31] me and get past it lay it down just let
[28:33] me see jesus and when you see him
[28:36] clearly you see everybody else more
[28:38] clear
[28:38] [Applause]
[28:41] hallelujah
[28:50] we should hope bring the whole thing to
[28:52] one solid picture and that's jesus
[28:53] christ can you say amen
[28:56] i'm still reading from there we should
[28:57] bring the whole thing to one solid
[29:00] picture
[29:01] and that is jesus christ you guys still
[29:03] have that quote
[29:04] leave it up if you would
[29:07] it goes on to say a little thing and i
[29:09] always like to read this i know it's a
[29:11] little lengthy but i want you to look at
[29:12] this next next paragraph it starts with
[29:15] a young lady last night if you guys
[29:16] could pull that up
[29:18] a young lady last night in an interview
[29:21] she said she said a minister's and it
[29:23] was a minister's daughter had some kind
[29:24] of a little love affair
[29:26] and she had lost her mind about it she'd
[29:28] gone
[29:30] a breakdown had a nervous breakdown
[29:32] very beautiful young woman about 23
[29:34] years old it was a spiritual heart
[29:36] trouble her lover had run off and
[29:39] married some other woman
[29:40] and yet she was still in love and this
[29:42] boy telling her that he was
[29:45] in love yet with her he'd already
[29:47] married somebody else he's
[29:49] playing playing along with her too
[29:51] and his father had caused it
[29:53] and i said oh nonsense he didn't have to
[29:56] marry that other girl he did it because
[29:58] he failed to have the right kind of love
[30:00] for you
[30:01] that's exactly but see being all wound
[30:05] up into that
[30:06] the girl sat there in such a stoop she's
[30:09] in an insane institution
[30:11] over a love affair that failed
[30:15] if if someone's going mental like that
[30:17] then that can't be true love
[30:21] something wrong
[30:22] she's in a mental state
[30:24] and he failed he says no
[30:27] i wish you guys could get that up maybe
[30:29] we lost that but
[30:31] you see being all the girl all wound up
[30:33] into that the girl is in such a stoop
[30:35] like and she said oh
[30:37] i know johnny loves me i know he loves
[30:39] me he's already married to another woman
[30:41] i know she's just holding on to that
[30:44] and the way brother bryan explained to
[30:46] see that's all
[30:48] she could see
[30:52] this
[30:53] trial this
[30:55] broken love affair
[30:57] impaired her vision it's a christian
[31:00] girl in church
[31:02] it's a kid grow up in crit in church
[31:04] and a love affair and a so-called love
[31:06] affair the thing that wasn't right so
[31:08] affected her spirit and impaired her
[31:10] vision that the only thing she could see
[31:13] is this lie that he loves me he still
[31:15] loves me he still loves me and she's
[31:17] being led along like a carrot on a stick
[31:22] into something that wasn't true at all
[31:24] she's so consumed by it she's lost her
[31:26] vision of jesus
[31:28] she's lost her vision of jesus
[31:31] and so being all wound up in that he
[31:33] failed to find where i'm at here
[31:37] she said he said that's all she could
[31:39] see
[31:40] she lived in that one little world
[31:43] by
[31:44] herself she had formed herself in there
[31:48] that's some of the most powerful
[31:51] words
[31:55] i don't
[31:57] preach psychology
[32:00] as any alternative for the gospel
[32:03] but god knows human beings
[32:08] and
[32:09] the way he says this that she when she
[32:12] kept in that mindset and she only seen
[32:15] that one thing it formed herself all by
[32:18] herself it formed herself into this
[32:21] bondage she wasn't seeing things right
[32:23] anymore
[32:25] and she formed herself in there and i'll
[32:28] tell you people get so formed and so
[32:30] bounded into this the only way they see
[32:32] things the only they never get past it
[32:34] and some things are so deep it just
[32:36] takes
[32:37] the power and love and grace of god to
[32:39] reach down and say grab my hand
[32:44] grab my hand because you're not seeing
[32:45] things right now
[32:47] and i'll pull you up here so you can see
[32:50] things more clearly
[32:52] how many has ever had god do that for
[32:54] you
[32:55] see the testimonies amen yes
[32:58] because our vision gets impaired
[32:59] sometimes this was so serious he's there
[33:02] and so now
[33:04] he for she formed herself in there and
[33:07] she lived in that little world by
[33:09] herself interesting this is so typical
[33:12] of so many of us when we get into a
[33:14] world all to ourself
[33:16] and we form ourselves in this thing
[33:18] that's all we can see
[33:21] we just see that and it ruins us for
[33:24] life because we can't see nothing else
[33:33] and i took a hold of her hand
[33:35] i said listen to me
[33:37] and the lord showed a vision you see
[33:39] that she knowed i know nothing about and
[33:41] he said it to you that's something that
[33:43] had taken place some transaction between
[33:46] the two of them and when that was said
[33:48] then that snapped her right quick
[33:52] so by a vision something
[33:55] she knew that he wouldn't have known
[33:56] about
[33:57] the lord says it through him
[34:00] and that jolted her
[34:02] it shook her
[34:04] sometimes we need a jolt
[34:06] sometimes we need god to shake us
[34:09] can i get an amen this morning
[34:11] and it's god's grace to shake us
[34:13] and wake us up because our vision is
[34:14] impaired we're starting to see things
[34:16] and we're starting to get cloudy and
[34:18] everything's looking bad and the church
[34:20] is looking bad and everything and
[34:22] sometimes god needs to shake us i pray
[34:24] god would shake us this morning
[34:27] jolt us
[34:29] because if we're not coming to church to
[34:31] see jesus we're coming for the wrong
[34:32] reason
[34:37] and here's and i have to slow down and
[34:39] just read this here's how he says it now
[34:42] he said now
[34:44] she snapped right quick and i said while
[34:46] you're out here out of there so she's
[34:48] like she comes out of this world he says
[34:50] while you're out of there look to
[34:52] calvary
[34:54] there you're going out there and you
[34:56] started to drink and a minister's
[34:58] daughter a pentecostal minister's
[35:00] daughter and doing things that you're
[35:01] doing trying to drown that sorrow man
[35:04] she's with insane she's out going
[35:06] against what she's been taught she's out
[35:08] drinking because people do that to drown
[35:10] their sorrows instead of turning to the
[35:11] lord
[35:12] it's a no-brainer we know why people do
[35:14] that right
[35:15] you know don't accuse people of doing
[35:17] that because that's the only
[35:19] satisfaction they have
[35:22] because they haven't learned about the
[35:23] true satisfaction in christ yet
[35:26] that's why they turn to those things
[35:28] and
[35:29] so
[35:30] he says you you're drowning your sorrow
[35:32] the man and somebody that don't care a
[35:34] snap of their finger for you and i said
[35:36] look younger calvary girl that's the
[35:38] only way back we've got to get ourselves
[35:41] focused to whether we live or die sink
[35:44] or drown it's calvary christ that's the
[35:47] thing that god wants us to come back to
[35:49] and men in the focus of god's word
[35:51] instead of bringing it together and
[35:52] making it say one thing that god makes
[35:54] us say we look at the natural side later
[35:56] on he says we won't have nothing to do
[35:58] with the rest of them
[36:00] i'm not going to fellowship with them we
[36:01] won't have anything to do with it and
[36:03] that see that's the first thing is
[36:04] presented instead of focusing in to know
[36:06] that it's brotherly love that we should
[36:08] have one for another and to understand
[36:10] one another and to love one another and
[36:12] to worship with one another
[36:14] they degrade a man because of his
[36:16] clothes that he wears or the education
[36:19] that he has or the color of his skin or
[36:22] something like that can anybody see that
[36:24] the prophet is fagging the problems in
[36:26] this nation right now in the 1960s they
[36:28] bring up racism now that spirit raises
[36:31] up again that's the problem the problem
[36:32] is racism i'll tell you the problem goes
[36:34] much deeper than that
[36:36] can you say man
[36:38] every human being without god has the
[36:40] potential to be racist to murder to do
[36:43] all these things wrong it's not one
[36:46] race or one color another that has that
[36:48] more than others no friend it's the
[36:50] problem with god not being in the heart
[36:51] of that man
[36:53] and that's why when i come into junior
[36:55] high school and i realized there was the
[36:57] preppies and they're the ones that
[36:58] weren't there weren't the preppies and
[37:00] guess what i wasn't a preppy i tried to
[37:02] go to kmart and buy a cheap alligator
[37:05] shirt because everybody was wearing
[37:06] alligators then i couldn't afford them
[37:08] at dillard's so i came i found my answer
[37:11] i found a shirt with an alligator on it
[37:14] it wasn't the real brand but i thought i
[37:16] could get by with it
[37:19] dad i gotta have that shirt i got that
[37:21] shirt i wore it
[37:22] because why there was so much of this
[37:25] spirit of putting down if you got a
[37:28] little funny ears or funny nose or your
[37:30] different color and all this and it
[37:32] wasn't just one race or one group that
[37:34] was doing it it was everywhere because
[37:36] why man without god will look at other
[37:38] human beings and belittle them and put
[37:40] them down and find your i don't have to
[37:43] be around you
[37:44] the first time i experienced it i was
[37:46] pretty sheltered until then i realized
[37:48] wow this is how the world functions
[37:51] maybe that's why i got a heart then
[37:53] for the one who wasn't a preppy
[37:56] because i wasn't crappy i wore that
[37:59] alligator shirt
[38:00] and they still
[38:01] put me down because they knew it came
[38:03] from kmart
[38:05] i knew right away
[38:07] i tried my hardest to be accepted i
[38:09] tried to get the right clothes
[38:11] and i'm doing it all because that's
[38:12] what's in the heart of man is put people
[38:14] into categories
[38:16] it's just upon how good-looking you are
[38:19] and how much money you have and what
[38:21] neighborhood you live in and i can deal
[38:23] with that out there but when that starts
[38:25] to come into church i just start to get
[38:27] real righteous ignition
[38:30] you can't fellowship with somebody
[38:32] because of what they wear or because
[38:34] they act a little quirky
[38:37] they're a little nerdy
[38:40] amen
[38:42] i think it's sad there's only one answer
[38:44] for it when you see the blood of jesus
[38:46] christ it washes all that away
[38:50] when you see christ right you see human
[38:52] beings right amen
[38:53] you see the way god sees them can you
[38:55] say amen
[38:57] so i experienced that there but i get so
[38:59] upset when i see it creep in
[39:02] to the church
[39:04] i tell you friends
[39:08] i stand with
[39:10] every
[39:11] believer here this morning no matter how
[39:14] quirky they are
[39:16] no matter what they've been through
[39:18] no matter what past they've had no
[39:21] matter what they're wearing
[39:23] amen
[39:27] amen
[39:29] if they're loving god and trying
[39:32] i stand with them
[39:34] don't you dare put them down
[39:42] amen
[39:43] we don't have nothing to do with the
[39:44] rest of them that's like the first thing
[39:46] is presented
[39:47] instead of focusing on brotherly love we
[39:49] should have one for another to
[39:50] understand one another to love one
[39:51] another to worship with one another they
[39:53] did great a man becomes close he wears
[39:54] and the education he has the color of
[39:56] his skin or something like that or that
[39:58] therefore it separates people and men
[40:00] take off of that it never gives i love
[40:02] this statement too it never gives the
[40:04] inward man a chance to operate when
[40:06] you're seeing things right you're
[40:07] operating every day from the inward man
[40:10] not this right here
[40:11] not your not your head
[40:13] that those quotes are in victory day if
[40:15] you want to read them
[40:16] a few weeks ago i preached on peter
[40:18] james and john being welcomed up to the
[40:20] mountain with jesus
[40:22] when they got up there they seen moses
[40:24] and elijah there talking with jesus
[40:27] and then i'll just summarize real
[40:28] quickly you can go back and listen if
[40:30] you want but it was really effective to
[40:32] me to be able to see that when
[40:35] after it it showed the disciples that
[40:38] moses and elijah moses represented the
[40:40] law elijah represented the prophets and
[40:43] all the law and all the prophets
[40:45] revealed a mystery and that's jesus
[40:46] christ the mystery christ
[40:48] so you couldn't see jesus right without
[40:50] knowing that the mystery of him is
[40:52] revealed in the law and the prophets
[40:53] don't dump out the law don't dump out
[40:55] the prophets
[40:56] but when it was all over with
[40:58] okay
[41:00] and peter wanted to build tabernacles
[41:02] and this is exciting we'll build three
[41:03] type of girls no no no no he's quickly
[41:05] interrupted no no we're not going to
[41:07] build three places of worship here and
[41:09] then as soon as he said that moses and
[41:11] elijah fade away and the only thing they
[41:13] could see is jesus
[41:17] every person needs that experience
[41:21] and even if you read the word for years
[41:23] and read your bible and read the message
[41:25] at the end of it all if you don't see
[41:27] more of jesus
[41:29] because you see this all fade away
[41:31] someday once jesus is revealed to you
[41:34] can you say mom this reveals jesus
[41:36] christ but once you see jesus it's an
[41:38] experience it's an experience it's not
[41:40] an intellectual conception of jesus
[41:44] it's meeting him and the only seeing
[41:46] jesus and i said something in that
[41:48] service i want to say again it's come to
[41:50] back to me and it's become even more
[41:53] real and i've said it already today i'm
[41:55] going to say it again when we see jesus
[41:57] right it's the answer to all things
[42:02] it's the deliverance for all things we
[42:05] live in a world of psychology we live in
[42:07] the world the problem i have with
[42:08] psychology is not that they can't
[42:10] diagnose a human being they've had six
[42:12] thousand years to diagnose a human being
[42:14] they get pretty good at it they can peg
[42:16] a human being in his nature how he
[42:18] thinks his behavior from his thinking
[42:19] they can peg it pretty good
[42:22] god can peg it more than anybody
[42:25] but the one problem i have with
[42:26] psychology is they think they have the
[42:28] answer to correct man amen they didn't
[42:31] create man so they don't have the answer
[42:35] it takes
[42:36] the power and reality of the lord jesus
[42:39] christ to come on the scene to change a
[42:41] man
[42:43] how many can say amen to that
[42:46] and so it it it's it's when we see jesus
[42:49] right it brings deliverance when we see
[42:50] jesus right it's the answer to all
[42:52] things there's no way we can be let me
[42:55] say it this way and and please uh know
[42:57] that i love you this morning and i'm
[42:58] being straight but please know if
[43:01] there's no way we can be looking at him
[43:04] correctly and have division
[43:09] there's no way we can be looking at
[43:11] jesus right and have strife and have
[43:13] habits and have jealousy and have
[43:15] bitterness and anger and pride those
[43:17] things in our humanness are going to pop
[43:19] up but when we keep looking at jesus
[43:21] then that's not the prominent thing can
[43:23] you say man there's no way we can be
[43:25] looking at jesus right and see other
[43:26] human beings the wrong way we've got to
[43:29] see it through jesus eyes and if you see
[43:31] him right with clear vision it makes you
[43:34] broken down and know that you're nothing
[43:36] without him
[43:38] paul said i know nothing except christ
[43:41] and him crucified
[43:44] i'm looking at one thing christ and him
[43:46] crucified that's it it's everything and
[43:48] that's the way that i know him and when
[43:50] i know him then i know that i can look
[43:52] at life right i can look at other people
[43:54] right i can look at the word right i can
[43:57] look at everything the right way
[44:00] it's just that simple this morning can
[44:02] you say man
[44:04] there's a story of a man that was
[44:05] painting i might have been michelangelo
[44:07] i can't remember who it was
[44:09] but
[44:09] i wanted to get the story i couldn't
[44:11] find it but i read it years ago
[44:13] and he got to the place it might have
[44:15] been the lord's supper he was painting
[44:16] but he got the place of painting the
[44:18] face of jesus
[44:20] and he said he walked away
[44:22] and he tried for days sometimes into
[44:24] months to come back to the face of jesus
[44:26] and he couldn't do it he broke down
[44:28] every time he looked into his face and
[44:30] tried to paint it
[44:31] he said no man
[44:32] that looks truly into the face of jesus
[44:35] can ever be the same again
[44:38] and that's just a painting
[44:40] how about the reality of seeing him
[44:42] in all of his glory
[44:44] through the word
[44:47] it changes you it changes your outlook
[44:50] changes your perspective can you say
[44:52] that
[45:00] tight skirts and see through blouses
[45:04] painted toes and fingernails all
[45:06] different colors and eyeliner and makeup
[45:08] caked on
[45:13] you're not seeing jesus correctly
[45:16] yet your vision is impaired
[45:20] by the fashions of this world
[45:23] and you lost your vision of true beauty
[45:26] when you get a vision of what god says
[45:28] true beauty is
[45:30] you don't need to manufacture it
[45:35] can i have a few more amends to that
[45:37] you're a gamer
[45:40] you're tied to that video game screen
[45:42] like a slave
[45:44] it's all right boy i know it's okay
[45:47] but i'm gonna tell you
[45:49] if you're a slave to that you just don't
[45:50] see jesus right yet
[45:54] never get the result you never get that
[45:55] result from seeing him right your
[45:58] passion your satisfaction
[46:00] your trust in life life changes when you
[46:04] see jesus correctly you want to know
[46:05] what the message is the message was to
[46:07] restore the word
[46:09] all the word
[46:11] god sent it through a prophet to restore
[46:12] all the word to us for what reason so we
[46:14] can see jesus right
[46:17] and look into his face
[46:19] how many knows the scripture in
[46:20] corinthians it says when we look into
[46:22] him face to face clearly without any
[46:25] veils
[46:26] without any
[46:27] impaired vision
[46:28] we're changed from glory to glory
[46:32] to glory amen
[46:34] it's not being a church mentor it's
[46:36] remember it's seeing him right
[46:39] i woke up early here a couple days ago
[46:41] about three in the morning and they got
[46:42] to thinking about this subject of the
[46:45] vision impaired
[46:47] i don't know why i kept imagining a
[46:49] parent
[46:50] who
[46:52] got their kids sitting down and they
[46:53] don't understand yet that the kid has a
[46:55] vision problem
[46:57] you might have done this with your kids
[46:58] if you don't understand they have a
[46:59] vision problem then you're requiring
[47:01] certain things of them to see certain
[47:03] things
[47:04] becca and i had my dog first daughter
[47:06] amariah and so she had something how she
[47:10] processed things in her mind and so
[47:12] early on in her school days we were
[47:13] pretty rough on her we'll admit that and
[47:16] so then we went six months to a year and
[47:18] she just wasn't getting it and we were
[47:19] being a bit hard on her and
[47:22] so then we took her to someone to see
[47:24] someone realize she has she has this
[47:26] thing and the way she processes things
[47:28] and looks at and once we knew that first
[47:30] of all we made changes to how she
[47:32] learned and also
[47:34] we
[47:35] we recognized what we were doing wrong
[47:38] we apologized to her
[47:40] because we didn't realize there was a
[47:41] there was a bit of a different way she
[47:43] was possibly processing it i thought of
[47:45] a young boy or a young girl and i just
[47:47] kept imagining somebody just slapping
[47:49] him in the head saying tell me what you
[47:51] see tell me what you see why can't you
[47:53] see that's a drum set why can't you see
[47:56] slapping them on the head i don't know
[47:57] why i had that am i just slapping them
[47:59] and then just god convicted me is that
[48:01] you can't slap people on the head
[48:04] if their spiritual vision is impaired
[48:09] god help me
[48:12] because all that needs to happen is god
[48:14] supernaturally change
[48:17] and take that vision apparently and
[48:19] change it
[48:20] and they can see it clearly and then
[48:22] it's over
[48:24] it's over
[48:25] but how harsh would it be to beat
[48:27] someone and keep trying to do that and
[48:29] god just moved about it that that's
[48:32] and that's maybe why i'm preaching a
[48:33] little bit about it this morning as long
[48:36] as you will listen to me this morning um
[48:39] you know i believe that and that's just
[48:41] that it's just like your vision may be
[48:43] impaired about jesus i don't know where
[48:45] you're at today but your vision may be
[48:47] imperative maybe you're sitting here and
[48:49] and you come to my church and you just
[48:52] don't see everything just right
[48:54] i tell you
[48:56] god so moved me by this
[48:58] that's what actually keeps me preaching
[49:02] i would give up
[49:03] i would go do something different and i
[49:05] don't have a degree so i'd probably be
[49:07] at mcdonald's deck
[49:11] my wife would have to support
[49:14] me what keeps me going is because
[49:18] i've got some corrective things in the
[49:20] word here
[49:22] that if you need corrective surgery i'm
[49:24] going to keep preaching them so your
[49:25] vision can be corrected
[49:30] i thought about the natural vision and
[49:32] eyes that get bad sometimes isn't it
[49:34] interesting that
[49:35] you know eyes
[49:37] get bad eyesight for most people gets
[49:40] bad but your eyesight gets bad over time
[49:43] if you're in here and you're 40 50 60
[49:45] years old and you still have perfect
[49:47] vision you ought to raise your hand and
[49:48] say thank you lord
[49:50] but most time it what happens is that
[49:53] impaired visions happens now some kids
[49:55] get glasses right away a lot of times it
[49:57] happens over time over years right and
[50:00] your vision becomes worse and comes
[50:02] worse and i remember as a kid
[50:05] i had perfect vision
[50:06] until i was 40. perfect vision and i was
[50:10] blessed but i wanted to wear glasses
[50:11] because they were cool
[50:14] so i kept having my dad take me to the
[50:16] doctor
[50:17] hoping that i have an impaired vision
[50:20] because i already had my glasses picked
[50:22] out
[50:25] preppy glasses
[50:29] finally i just gave up you know i've got
[50:32] thank you lord i got perfect vision
[50:35] and then 40 years old hit how many has
[50:37] ever passed 40 years
[50:38] old everything almost right on my
[50:42] birthday
[50:44] and i'm going
[50:46] i'm reading
[50:47] almost on my birthday the very day and
[50:50] i'm reading and it's it's it's a little
[50:53] blurred
[50:55] it wasn't my birthday just right on the
[50:57] very day it changes
[50:58] and then at 45
[51:00] other things changed
[51:02] 50
[51:03] more things change i won't even tell you
[51:05] about some things that change
[51:08] is it type is it a type of the spiritual
[51:11] that
[51:12] even for believers if we're not careful
[51:14] it's over the years of going through
[51:16] hurts and pains and the struggle to be a
[51:18] christian
[51:20] that our vision gets impaired
[51:23] come on now
[51:24] it's a type of the naturalist that it
[51:26] happens over so many years
[51:29] and it kept getting worse and so what i
[51:31] did was and you know the thing is is
[51:32] that i go back in every year every two
[51:35] years and i i can't find my classes now
[51:39] they usually say well they're on your
[51:41] head
[51:43] but you i go in every couple years to
[51:46] to walmart
[51:48] because i'm a member of the first church
[51:50] of walmart
[51:52] any other members here
[51:55] so i go in and the thing is every year
[51:57] you know he does this test and
[51:59] everything
[52:00] and it's just every year there's a
[52:01] little bit it's a little bit worse a
[52:02] little better that's why i had to change
[52:03] my glasses it doesn't say the same it
[52:05] gets a little worse a lot worse
[52:07] and i asked i said is this going to keep
[52:09] happening and what i always think what
[52:12] kind of glasses are am i going to be
[52:13] wearing at 70 years old
[52:16] how are they going to look like the
[52:18] bottoms of a bottle
[52:20] a coke bottle
[52:22] how many how many in here has glasses
[52:24] pretty thick
[52:26] who has real thick glasses
[52:28] give me your glasses brother quinlan
[52:33] not to embarrass you but
[52:35] okay i'll embarrass you then
[52:38] wow
[52:41] these are pretty thick
[52:44] whew
[52:46] pretty thick glasses i've seen thicker
[52:48] but this is pretty thick
[52:50] brother quinlan uh
[52:52] ike um
[52:54] the government may be interested in
[52:56] these things you know these are pretty
[52:57] thick strap them to the bottom of a
[53:00] satellite plane
[53:03] use them in ukraine
[53:05] but you know it just it keeps getting
[53:08] worse and worse and worse and i wonder
[53:09] how and so then but the thing is is i
[53:12] thank god
[53:14] that i have something to go because then
[53:16] i go through this process
[53:18] of
[53:19] sitting in there in the chair and they
[53:21] got these machines and they bring them
[53:22] in front of you first they let you read
[53:23] the letters on the wall and every time i
[53:26] go and do it he has these slides that he
[53:28] puts in front of it and he asks you the
[53:30] question this is it okay can you read
[53:33] that line
[53:34] and the year before i might be able to
[53:35] read it now it's all now it's all blurry
[53:38] there's different impaired vision
[53:39] there's some near side of some
[53:40] farsighted some cloudy there's a lot of
[53:43] different impairment to vision
[53:45] and spiritually there's a lot of
[53:47] different reasons why people
[53:49] get their vision impaired
[53:52] a lot of times it's pat their past and
[53:54] they view everything now
[53:57] through the the lens of their past
[54:00] am i telling the truth
[54:03] and
[54:04] so i look at that machine and he's asked
[54:07] me the questions
[54:09] do you see that can you read that can
[54:11] you read it
[54:14] and i'll read it the year before and now
[54:16] i can't read it so then he takes those
[54:18] little slides and he just keeps going
[54:20] keeps going
[54:22] and then i can read it and then i can
[54:23] read it and then i can read it and it
[54:25] gets clearer and gets clearer and i
[54:28] don't know why i was thinking about that
[54:29] a few mornings ago i just thought that's
[54:31] what the lord
[54:32] in his grace does for us
[54:34] amen amen remember science advances in
[54:37] things that's a type of the spiritual
[54:38] that's happening and through the lens of
[54:40] the message of the hour he just could
[54:42] put anything can you see it now
[54:46] and just like it was a process for you
[54:47] to get in pair vision and it took years
[54:50] it's a process then that he takes
[54:54] to keep putting the right lens in front
[54:55] of you
[54:56] until you can see it clearly
[54:59] that's why i personally believe it's
[55:01] whatever whatever you want to feel i
[55:03] believe most of our growth in the lord
[55:04] happens after we get the holy ghost
[55:08] we're not a perfect person as soon as we
[55:10] get the holy ghost when they entered the
[55:12] promised land a type of the holy ghost
[55:15] when they entered they hadn't overcome
[55:16] anything
[55:19] no yet preachers different ways but
[55:21] that's the way i believe it you need the
[55:22] holy spirit in your life to change your
[55:24] desires you can have it this morning i
[55:26] believe if you surrender your heart but
[55:28] then you begin your battle and the lord
[55:30] begins a growth that you don't see
[55:31] things clearly yet but through the word
[55:34] through gospel ministers he's going to
[55:36] take like that doctor because it's dr
[55:37] jesus can you say amen what do they call
[55:39] a guy that does your eyes like that
[55:41] optometrist god's the great optometrist
[55:45] god's the great counselor how many
[55:46] believe that
[55:49] and he just keeps doing it
[55:51] and i can read the whole line it gets
[55:54] better it gets better it's good i see it
[55:56] i see it i see it
[55:59] that's what he's doing in the bride of
[56:00] jesus christ
[56:02] and i would
[56:04] i would
[56:05] get around that atmosphere just as soon
[56:07] as you could
[56:09] i would get where the gospel is being
[56:11] preached in the message of the hour with
[56:13] the opening of this word through the
[56:14] seven seals i'd stay right there because
[56:17] i'm safe to say all of us have developed
[56:20] some type of impaired vision of some
[56:22] kind
[56:23] amen
[56:24] all of us
[56:26] and we're going to have some more
[56:28] heartaches if we don't see jesus right
[56:32] if you look up here and see me he's just
[56:34] a man you're not looking at me right i
[56:36] yield my gift and pray
[56:38] before the lord to get his word for the
[56:40] people then i have to step out of the
[56:42] way but you have to do that when you
[56:44] come and hear me preach
[56:46] you have to look at me right
[56:48] now that this is the lord speaking to
[56:50] you can you say amen
[56:52] and he takes all
[56:54] the blurry vision can you say amen
[56:58] he takes that and it comes clearer and
[57:00] clearer and clearer and clearer and i
[57:02] can read it better and i can read it
[57:04] better and god takes
[57:06] and does the same thing with us and that
[57:08] doctor just makes it now we're ready to
[57:11] provide you for some glasses that fits
[57:14] that so you can see clearly
[57:16] then i walk out and they charge me four
[57:17] hundred dollars
[57:21] you can try to keep viewing things
[57:23] through your own eyesight
[57:25] through your old glasses
[57:28] through your rose colored glasses
[57:31] through the glasses of your past
[57:34] or you can get up in the chair and say
[57:35] lord start restoring my eyesight
[57:40] the answer can you say amen
[57:42] it was a slow process to lose the
[57:44] clarity in your vision so it's a slow
[57:46] process to restore it back again
[57:49] one lens at a time can you say amen
[57:52] read that to me now now read it and put
[57:54] together now read it read that to me now
[57:56] it's kind of like staying in the word of
[57:57] god i tell young people you might read
[57:59] some sections you don't have a clue
[58:01] what's being said keep reading it keep
[58:03] praying can you say man because this
[58:05] reveals jesus christ and from my
[58:07] experience i read something years ago i
[58:09] didn't see and now i see it crystal
[58:12] clear i know what the lord means by it
[58:15] because this is a mystery being revealed
[58:17] and it's not trying to understand it up
[58:19] here so much as it becomes a revelation
[58:21] to us and we see jesus more
[58:26] clearly
[58:27] when you have impaired vision
[58:30] and you only see men as trees jesus says
[58:34] i'm not done with you yet
[58:37] he can touch your eyes this morning
[58:41] jesus is here
[58:43] to touch your eyes
[58:46] how many believe that
[58:48] if he did it physically to somebody he
[58:50] can do it to us spiritually he loves you
[58:52] this morning
[58:53] he has a care for you he knows your life
[58:55] inside it out
[58:57] and whatever has happened at the
[58:58] beginning if you were as crystal clear
[59:00] as an eight nine year old boy or girl
[59:02] and i find that happens god
[59:04] supernaturally does something in their
[59:05] life and they know jesus is real and it
[59:08] just becomes so real to him back then
[59:11] and sometimes if you don't go on with
[59:12] the lord then you get sidetracked
[59:15] so you have a clear vision and it's
[59:17] simplicity and it's the heart of a child
[59:19] a lot of times it's the simplicity of a
[59:21] child
[59:22] i love my grandbaby i really do not just
[59:24] because
[59:25] grandparents normally love grandbabies
[59:27] but
[59:28] i just look at her and i see innocence i
[59:30] see simplicity
[59:32] i see i have a picture of her just
[59:33] raising her hands in church and she
[59:35] probably don't even know all that she's
[59:36] doing but she's just raising her hands
[59:38] and she's so pure and art she doesn't
[59:41] play adult games that all of us do
[59:45] and guile in their heart to play little
[59:47] games with one another it's just an
[59:49] innocence
[59:51] tire of adult kings
[59:53] and by mean that i mean just the little
[59:56] bitterness and games we play with one
[59:58] another
[59:59] and i i want to be that innocent
[1:00:01] child-like heart again
[1:00:03] amen
[1:00:05] so you have that the beginning and then
[1:00:06] life just gets in the way and troubles
[1:00:09] gets in the way
[1:00:11] all the stuff happens in between and
[1:00:13] your vision becomes clouded and you're
[1:00:15] not seeing jesus right you're not seeing
[1:00:17] other people right that's why brother
[1:00:18] brown says oh he says i don't want to
[1:00:20] die an old cranky
[1:00:22] man i'm paraphrasing but he says just a
[1:00:25] you know begrudging just a harsh bitter
[1:00:29] because life has brought you so many
[1:00:30] disappointments you just become more and
[1:00:32] more bitter about life he said oh god
[1:00:34] don't crown my life with just being a
[1:00:36] crabby old man that's what i said
[1:00:40] but crown my life with the glory of god
[1:00:43] let me end this better than the way i
[1:00:45] began it
[1:00:47] jesus said you're not seeing it right
[1:00:49] yet he didn't run away he didn't say
[1:00:51] that was enough he touched his eyes
[1:00:53] again and he could see everything
[1:00:55] clearly and probably the first thing
[1:00:57] he'd seen was jesus
[1:01:00] how many want to see jesus right
[1:01:04] you see jesus right it's the answer to
[1:01:06] your marriage problems
[1:01:12] when you see jesus right it's the answer
[1:01:14] to your domestic problems
[1:01:17] when you see jesus right it's the answer
[1:01:19] to your healing
[1:01:21] when you see jesus right it's the answer
[1:01:23] to you being washed with forgiveness in
[1:01:25] your heart towards other people
[1:01:27] it's everything
[1:01:30] lord don't let me lose my vision of you
[1:01:33] let it be cleared by the holy spirit
[1:01:36] this morning
[1:01:37] there's an old song that says don't lose
[1:01:40] your vision
[1:01:42] of jesus
[1:01:45] keep your eyes
[1:01:48] ever
[1:01:49] on
[1:01:50] him i just forgot the words
[1:01:56] many friends
[1:01:59] and dear loved ones
[1:02:01] have lost their way
[1:02:03] they have lost
[1:02:05] their vision
[1:02:07] of him
[1:02:10] don't lose
[1:02:12] your vision
[1:02:14] of jesus
[1:02:18] keep your eyes
[1:02:27] many friends
[1:02:29] [Music]
[1:02:34] their way
[1:02:37] they've lost
[1:02:42] [Music]
[1:02:49] your vision
[1:02:52] of jesus
[1:02:56] keep your eyes
[1:03:01] [Music]
[1:03:12] have lost
[1:03:14] their
[1:03:20] [Music]
[1:03:25] just lay your hands on somebody next to
[1:03:27] you
[1:03:30] may those be the hands of jesus that
[1:03:32] touched the eyes
[1:03:33] the blind man
[1:03:35] can only see men as trees
[1:03:38] vision hadn't become clear
[1:03:42] that same jesus is here
[1:03:44] it doesn't take anything but just a
[1:03:46] simple heart just a simple heart
