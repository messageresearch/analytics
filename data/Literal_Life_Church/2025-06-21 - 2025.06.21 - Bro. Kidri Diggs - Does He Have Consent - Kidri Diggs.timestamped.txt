[22:21] uh, the Lightener sisters come up right
[22:23] after this one. The more that I
[22:26] surrender,
[22:29] the lighter
[22:31] my Lord.
[22:34] The more that I release my cares, the
[22:40] more you take control.
[22:45] And the more that I can humble myself,

[24:49] Words that tell me I'm no good. Chapters
[24:54] that defined me for so long.
[24:59] But the hands of grace and endless love
[25:03] dusted off and picked me up. Told my
[25:07] heart that hope is never gone.
[25:11] God is in this story.
[25:15] God is in the details.
[25:18] Even in the broken parts, he holds my
[25:22] heart. He never fails. When I'm at my
[25:26] weakest,
[25:28] I will trust in Jesus.
[25:31] Always in the highs and lows. The one
[25:35] who goes before me, God is in this
[25:40] story.
[25:42] [Music]
[25:46] So if the storm you're walking through
[25:49] feels like it's too much and you wonder
[25:53] if he even cares at all.

[26:02] promised he won't let you go. Your song
[26:06] of healings written in the scars.

[26:17] Even in the broken parts, he holds my
[26:21] heart. He never fails. When I'm at my
[26:25] weakest,
[26:26] I will trust in Jesus.
[26:30] Always in the highs and lows, the one
[26:33] who goes before me. God is in this
[26:38] story.
[26:42] like addiction. If it is like disease,
[26:47] he's the one who feels a prisoner. He's
[26:50] the healer of the peace. If it is like
[26:55] depression, if it is broken home, he's
[27:00] the one who holds your sorrow. He won't
[27:04] leave you here alone.
[27:07] Oh,
[27:09] God is in this story.
[27:12] God is in the details.
[27:15] Even in the broken parts, he holds my
[27:19] heart. He never fails. And when I'm at
[27:23] my weakest,
[27:25] I will trust in Jesus.

[35:17] Just one touch. Can you say amen? And I
[35:20] believe you're in the right place if you

[35:25] tonight if you yield to him. He can
[35:27] touch your life and then you'll never be
[35:29] the same again. So many can lift their
[35:31] hands and testify that somebody can sing
[35:33] with our sister tonight because you know
[35:36] it to be true. But when he puts his hand
[35:39] upon a life, things are never the same.

[35:44] Praise the Lord. I love the Lord
[35:46] tonight. I appreciate all of his
[35:47] goodness to us. And I've been praying in
[35:49] my heart today in the last days that the
[35:52] Lord would just give us something
[35:54] special from his word. I need him to
[35:57] give something. How many would raise
[35:59] your hand say, "Lord, give me something
[36:01] specific to my life tonight." How many
[36:03] knows God can do that? He can speak
[36:06] something specific. And probably most of
[36:08] us tonight, we need some answers. But
[36:10] you know what? If you don't need
[36:12] anything else, you need a refreshing in
[36:14] the Holy Ghost.
[36:16] He said he'd give us times of refreshing
[36:18] in the Holy Ghost. That's not just a
[36:20] feeling. That's not just a sensation,
[36:23] but something that just generates in our
[36:26] soul. And I want him to do that tonight
[36:28] for me and give give his grace to us. I
[36:30] don't know this before brother Dixs
[36:32] comes tonight. Back to that song. I
[36:34] don't know if we've done it. Haven't
[36:35] done it in a couple years. Key of C. Do
[36:37] you have that Jesus dropped the charges?
[36:39] I just wanted to tell the devil tonight
[36:41] Jesus dropped all the charges. And I
[36:44] don't those of the choir members that
[36:46] are out there, make sure you sing it as
[36:48] if you're up here singing cuz I need
[36:49] your help. But I like to sing this one
[36:51] together because uh God has certainly
[36:55] cleared the bride. Can you say amen?
[36:58] He's cleared the bride of all charges.
[37:02] Praise the Lord. Sing it with me.
[37:05] I was guilty
[37:08] of the charges
[37:11] to man disgrace.
[37:14] Oh, but Jesus
[37:16] with a special love
[37:19] save me by his grace.
[37:22] He pleaded
[37:24] and he pleaded.
[37:26] [Music]
[37:27] He pleaded my
[37:31] Jesus char.
[37:35] [Music]
[37:48] I live in sin too long.

[39:41] stands in that position. See, we don't
[39:44] look at the the state that we're in. We
[39:46] look at our standing.
[39:48] Can you say amen? Amen. The preacher's
[39:51] already here, so I better give it to
[39:52] Brother Diggs. That's for sure. You
[39:54] don't look at the state. You look at
[39:56] your standing with the Lord. Amen. The
[39:58] state will be different than your
[40:00] standing. But your state will never be
[40:03] stronger than your standing with the
[40:04] Lord. Amen. Amen. And you stand before
[40:07] him, not guilty. Amen. He's dropped all
[40:10] the charges. Praise the Lord. I'm
[40:11] excited for the word tonight. We welcome
[40:13] all of our visitors here. God bless you.
[40:15] And I can feel your kindred spirit.
[40:17] You're hungry for the word of God. We
[40:19] pray he'll give us a specific word
[40:20] tonight. as we worship in our hearts,
[40:22] not only through the songs, but when the
[40:25] word comes forth, we worship with our
[40:27] hearts responding with our amens. You
[40:29] know, Brother Diggs, if you don't say
[40:31] amen, he'll hold up a sign. He did it
[40:33] last time he was here. But let's let
[40:36] let's not let him hold up that sign
[40:37] tonight. Let's get behind it with a our
[40:39] amens, our heart. Say, Lord, speak to me
[40:42] tonight. Give me something, Lord, rich
[40:44] in my heart. And we're happy to have
[40:46] also Brother Homer Legoria, good friend
[40:49] of ours. Both these brothers are
[40:50] friends. and we're happy to have him
[40:52] back. It's been six, five years since my
[40:54] dad's memorial and he spoke that Sunday
[40:56] morning. Such comforting words to the
[40:58] church and family after losing my dad
[41:00] and such a wonderful service. It's been
[41:02] way too long. So, he'll be with us in
[41:04] the morning uh 10:30 Sunday school and
[41:06] then we have the regular service at 11.
[41:08] You're all welcome to come back.
[41:09] Tomorrow night's a tri-state youth
[41:11] meeting. Brother Diggs will speak for
[41:12] that as well at 5 at 5 o'clock. Sure
[41:15] appreciate you singing that song like a
[41:18] choir with me. Jesus dropped the
[41:19] charges. You all did good. You all
[41:22] should be a part of the choir. It
[41:23] sounded so good. Praise the Lord. God
[41:26] bless you. Amen. Let's sing together.
[41:29] Let's rejoice in the Lord. That song
[41:31] paid in full. Paid in full. Give me a
[41:33] key for that. And brother Davis can
[41:35] come.
[41:36] Paid in full by the blood of the lamb.
[41:44] Oh yes. Oh. Free from sin. free to live,
[41:50] but now I am.
[41:55] And it reads on the page where my sins
[42:01] were written down
[42:04] [Music]
[42:05] for by the blood of the lamb. Sing it
[42:10] with all your heart tonight. Oh
[42:15] by the blood of the
[42:23] heat.
[42:26] [Music]
[42:48] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[42:51] Good to be in the house of the Lord
[42:52] tonight.
[42:54] Amen. It's good to be up here in Toledo
[42:56] again, you know, with precious people,
[42:59] you know, that we love and appreciate.
[43:01] Amen. Appreciate all of you. Appreciate
[43:03] Brother Paul. Amen. It's always a
[43:06] blessing being on the side. Amen. Just
[43:09] uh fellowshipping with saints of like
[43:11] precious faith. Amen. And I know that
[43:14] you didn't come because of me, but you
[43:16] come to hear from God. Amen. Yes, sir.
[43:18] Amen.
[43:20] You know, a lot of times it's not
[43:23] uh us waiting on God. God is waiting on
[43:26] us.
[43:27] You know, so we are fulfilling a promise
[43:30] right now in this building. So wherever
[43:32] two or three are gathered, he's also in
[43:35] the midst. Amen. So we thank God for all
[43:38] that he's doing. Amen. Let's just bow,
[43:40] have a word of prayer. Amen. It's good.
[43:44] I got some of my family with me. Not
[43:46] everybody, but some of them, you know,
[43:47] they travel with me. So good to have
[43:49] them, too. Let's just pray and we'll get
[43:51] into the word of God. Amen. If you have
[43:53] unspoken requests, acknowledge the Lord
[43:55] by uplift the hand. Lord God, Father, we
[43:57] lift our hands to you, Lord, in faith.
[44:00] Lord, knowing that you see, all you
[44:01] hear, all you know, all concerning us,
[44:03] Lord, and Lord, your thoughts concerning
[44:06] us, Lord, are not thoughts of evil,
[44:08] Lord, but Lord, the thoughts of grace
[44:10] and peace and mercy, Lord, that you're
[44:12] given us, Lord, that you even planned in
[44:14] our lives before the foundation of the
[44:16] world. So, Lord, we're recipients of
[44:19] that, Lord. We're recipients of the
[44:22] fornowledge of God, Lord. that no matter
[44:24] what the enemy may try, whatever he may
[44:26] plan, he cannot stop the plan of God in
[44:30] each and every individual's life. So
[44:32] Lord, we just pray that you see that
[44:34] prayer, answer that prayer, Lord,
[44:36] according to your grace and mercy,
[44:38] according to your perfect will, Lord,
[44:40] and we pray that you would bless the
[44:41] services, Lord, this weekend, Lord.
[44:43] Bless brother Homer, Lord, and the
[44:45] inspiration you've given him, Lord, and
[44:47] Brother Paul as he leads the flock and
[44:49] all the different governments of the
[44:51] church, Lord. We just thank you, Lord.
[44:54] Lord, and we want to receive you in a
[44:56] greater measure in our lives, Lord.
[44:58] Lord, forgive us for our sins and
[45:00] trespasses. In the wonderful name of
[45:02] Jesus Christ, we pray. The church say,
[45:03] "Amen."
[45:05] Amen. If you have your Bibles, let's
[45:08] turn to um St. John chapter 5.
[45:14] St. John chapter 5.
[45:17] And then we're going to go to um
[45:20] Hebrews 11.
[45:29] St. John chapter 5
[45:34] then Hebrews 11.
[45:40] If you have it, say amen.
[45:44] Bible says
[45:46] Jesus went up to Jerusalem. Now there is
[45:49] at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool
[45:54] which is called in the Hebrew tongue
[45:56] Bethesda
[45:58] having five porches. In these lay a
[46:01] great multitude of impotent folk of
[46:03] blind halt withered waiting for the
[46:06] moving of the water. For an angel went
[46:09] down at a certain season into the pool
[46:13] and troubled the water. Whosoever then
[46:16] first
[46:18] Whosoever then first after the troubling
[46:21] of the water stepped in was made whole
[46:25] of whatsoever disease he had. And a
[46:28] certain man was there which had an
[46:31] infirmity 30 and 8 years. When Jesus saw
[46:35] him lie, and knew that he had been now a
[46:40] long time, in that case, he saith unto
[46:43] him, "Will thou be made whole?" Amen.
[46:47] Let's go to Hebrews 11
[46:51] and we just want to read verse 4 out of
[46:54] here.
[46:55] Hebrews 11 and verse 4.
[47:00] The Bible says,
[47:03] now let's drop, let's drop down to verse
[47:04] six.
[47:06] It says, "But without faith it is
[47:08] impossible to please him. For he that
[47:11] cometh to God must believe that he is
[47:15] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[47:19] diligently seek him." Amen. May the Lord
[47:22] have a bless reading of his word. You
[47:23] can have your seats.
[47:26] You know, I I think when we read the
[47:28] scripture, we can identify, you know,
[47:31] like key words like
[47:34] faith and impossible.
[47:36] But I think the key in the scripture is
[47:38] realizing that he is.
[47:41] You know, we should have faith to
[47:43] believe that God is whatever we need him
[47:47] to be. Amen.
[47:48] You know, and I want to say tonight that
[47:52] God is whatever we need him to be
[47:55] tonight, you know, according to his
[47:57] grace and mercy. But tonight, by the
[48:00] grace of God, my subject is, does he
[48:03] have consent?
[48:05] Does he have consent? And you know,
[48:08] that's that's like in the form of a
[48:10] question. And you're probably thinking
[48:13] like, where is Brother Diggs going with
[48:15] this consent thing? You know, consent is
[48:18] needed in a lot of things we do, but I
[48:22] want to I want to take it from a a a
[48:24] spiritual point of view tonight. You
[48:26] know, uh normally like when when when
[48:30] preachers preach at another church, I
[48:32] just can't come to Paul's church on a
[48:34] Sunday or brother Homer's church and
[48:36] say, "I'm preaching today." No, I got to
[48:39] get consent. You know, I got to get uh
[48:42] if if you want to use, for a lack of a
[48:44] better term, permission.
[48:46] I have to get permission. Why? Because
[48:49] they're the shepherd of those sheep.
[48:51] Amen. And for me to come in, even as an
[48:54] evangelist called by God, I still have
[48:56] to have consent. And you know, and
[48:59] sometimes even when you get there,
[49:03] even when you get there and get in the
[49:05] pull pit, you know, uh Paul, different
[49:08] brothers, they'll say, you know, uh take
[49:10] your liberty.
[49:15] What they're doing is they're giving the
[49:16] minister consent to be himself.
[49:19] Hallelujah. You know, so they say, "Hey,
[49:22] you know, uh, be what you are. You have
[49:25] consent."
[49:26] You know, but a lot of times they tell
[49:28] me, "Obey God."
[49:32] Cuz giving me consent means I can be who
[49:35] I am. Hallelujah. And sometimes me being
[49:39] who I am is just maybe a little too
[49:41] radical for some people. So they tell
[49:43] me, "Brother, obey God." Now,
[49:47] hallelujah. But when we think of
[49:49] consent, what is consent? I I just love
[49:51] the word, the framing of this word
[49:53] consent.
[49:55] You know, it says consent to permit,
[49:59] approve or agree, comply or yield. Amen.
[50:03] Now, we're going from a spiritual point
[50:05] of view. And when we look here in the
[50:07] Bible, we just read the story of the man
[50:11] uh uh who was whatever his sickness was.
[50:13] The Bible don't really say what his
[50:15] sickness was. It say he had an infirmity
[50:18] for 38 years. So he still could move.
[50:21] Even when the prophet talked about this,
[50:23] he said you don't quite know what he was
[50:25] in different places, but he had enough
[50:27] strength to get up and try to get to the
[50:29] pool, but he just couldn't get there
[50:32] fast enough. So for 38 years, I don't
[50:35] know how long he may have been sitting
[50:36] at that pool, but it says he had an
[50:39] infirmity for 38 years. Now I want to
[50:42] say this.
[50:44] Oh my let let me let me let me come back
[50:46] to that.
[50:48] Hallelujah. But uh to permit and
[50:51] approve. Hallelujah. You know that they
[50:54] had a a movement uh a couple years back.
[50:57] They called it the MeToo movement.
[51:00] And we know this movement was all about
[51:03] consent.
[51:04] You know, things that happened maybe 20,
[51:07] 30 years ago, uh, somebody was taken
[51:09] advantage of and now they come out and
[51:12] say, "Well, I didn't give them consent
[51:14] to do that to me." And then, uh,
[51:17] depending on what it was and how it
[51:19] happened, charges, some people went to
[51:21] jail, all kind of things happened. Why?
[51:23] Because they didn't have consent.
[51:26] And you know, when we look at uh this
[51:28] story right here, this man who was sick
[51:31] with an infirmity over 38 years, and
[51:34] every time he tried to be uh uh get rid
[51:37] of it or get in the pool, he somebody
[51:40] would step in his place. Now, he wasn't
[51:42] giving consent.
[51:45] He just wasn't fast enough.
[51:50] But then here comes Jesus.
[51:52] Now before we get to the conversation
[51:54] with him in Jesus, let's go back to
[51:58] without faith it is impossible to please
[52:00] him.
[52:01] But anyone that that that comes to God,
[52:04] we must first believe that he is. So I
[52:07] want you to understand something. When
[52:09] this imitate man, hallelujah, came in
[52:12] the presence of God, he was already a
[52:15] savior.
[52:17] He was already a healer. He was already
[52:20] a deliverer. Hallelujah. Every attribute
[52:24] that he was, he was in that moment.
[52:28] Hallelujah. It didn't take a work up. It
[52:31] didn't take something special for this
[52:33] man to do. Jesus was already everything
[52:36] he needed in that moment.
[52:40] Hallelujah. But this man had to realize
[52:44] whether or not he is.
[52:47] Hallelujah.
[52:49] But look church, he Jesus
[52:52] uh and I and I and I say it like that
[52:54] for you and I. Whatever you need
[52:57] tonight, hallelujah, he's already that.
[53:04] We don't have to have uh 45 minutes of
[53:07] preaching for you to be delivered.
[53:11] Once you realize he is and accept it,
[53:14] you give God consent
[53:17] to heal you or deliver you or or restore
[53:20] your joy or whatever it is. Hallelujah.
[53:23] Once you give God permission to be God,
[53:26] God moves into action.
[53:30] But the problem is we don't give him
[53:33] consent.
[53:36] Amen.
[53:40] You know, I was listening to the message
[53:44] door in a door, doors of the heart,
[53:46] whichever one it was. And the prophet
[53:49] started talking about the different
[53:50] doors of the heart. And you know, and I
[53:52] have these quotes, but I just feeling
[53:54] led to kind of keep it moving a little
[53:56] bit. And he says, he says, "What we'll
[53:59] do is we'll accept God as our savior.
[54:02] Come on now. Talk to me, church. We'll
[54:06] accept God as our savior. He is my
[54:08] savior. Amen. But he said a lot of
[54:10] times, hallelujah, we'll keep the door
[54:13] closed to him being Lord.
[54:16] We give him consent to save us from our
[54:19] wrongs, but we doesn't give him consent
[54:21] to rule over us. That's right.
[54:25] Rule over our thoughts, rule over our
[54:28] habits, rule over everything that we
[54:31] are.
[54:33] What about giving God that kind of
[54:34] consent? When you want to stay home and
[54:37] there's something pushing you, say, "Go
[54:39] to church."
[54:44] Hallelujah.
[54:46] As we're preaching, I want you to
[54:49] examine yourself spiritually.
[54:53] Not only and I'm not saying in a
[54:55] negative way because what I'm saying is
[54:57] whatever you need, God is already that.
[55:03] Hallelujah. And I love how the prophets
[55:06] say what we say, you know, one one of my
[55:07] things I like to I like to deal with
[55:09] because, you know, I I love talking
[55:11] about faith and preaching about faith
[55:13] and things like that and, you know,
[55:15] we'll say, uh, Lord, Lord, increase my
[55:18] faith. Give me more faith. He can't do
[55:21] it.
[55:23] Very good. Can't do it. He's already
[55:26] given you everything you need.
[55:28] Hallelujah. You have to believe that he
[55:30] is. Remember, he called Abraham the
[55:34] father of faith. And Abraham didn't even
[55:37] believe it yet. But did that change
[55:39] God's mind? No. He had to go through all
[55:42] the motions to become that in which he
[55:44] was for himself.
[55:47] God never wavered. God never doubted.
[55:50] Hallelujah. When Abraham went down there
[55:52] and gave up Sarah, he in God's mind, he
[55:55] was still the father of faith. Yeah.
[55:58] Yes, sir. See, so the problem in in in
[56:01] in our lives and what happens is not
[56:04] with God, it's with us.
[56:08] Hallelujah.
[56:10] And you know, that's what I love about
[56:12] God. God will speak a word into your
[56:15] life knowing you don't believe it yet.
[56:20] Hallelujah.
[56:22] He'll say you're a bride when all of us
[56:24] are in the world.
[56:27] Hallelujah. He sent forth the prophet
[56:30] with an end time word and none of us
[56:32] never even heard it before.
[56:34] But that's what Hallelujah. That's how
[56:36] God operates. He puts us in position so
[56:40] that we can see who he is. God loves to
[56:43] reveal himself to us. Hallelujah. But a
[56:47] lot of times God is trying to do things
[56:49] in our lives and we don't give him
[56:52] spiritual consent. Yes, the prophets say
[56:55] that uh we'll allow him to be uh uh
[56:59] savior but not lord. We allow him to be
[57:02] healer but not lord and all these other
[57:04] different things. You know what we want
[57:07] tonight is whatever area, whatever door
[57:10] concerning God and your growth, we want
[57:13] to give God consent to walk through that
[57:15] door.
[57:19] Hallelujah. Cuz remember, think about
[57:22] this.
[57:23] What if we get out of church tonight and
[57:26] somehow
[57:28] I got your keys and I drive back to the
[57:30] hotel?
[57:33] You're going to call me a brother D.
[57:34] What are you doing?
[57:37] I love you, but why did you take my car?
[57:41] You didn't give me consent.
[57:44] So, I look like I'm crazy if I'm doing
[57:48] something without your permission.
[57:51] Now, I say that to say this. That's what
[57:53] the devil is doing.
[57:56] He's getting in your car without your
[57:58] permission. He's getting in your family
[58:01] without your permission. He's getting on
[58:04] your job without your permission. He's
[58:06] even gotten in some of our bodies
[58:09] without our permission.
[58:12] Very true. Or has he gotten consent?
[58:19] Cuz
[58:22] remember when it comes to God and the
[58:24] believer, the devil can't do nothing
[58:27] except first he gets consent.
[58:31] Remember he went to Joe. God he the
[58:33] devil was minding his business and and
[58:36] Joe the devil is walking hanging around
[58:38] the church.
[58:41] He can hang around the church but he's
[58:43] powerless unless he got somebody to use.
[58:48] He can come to church tonight, but he
[58:51] can't do nothing in this service unless
[58:54] somebody gives him consent.
[58:58] Spiritual consent
[59:01] now.
[59:03] He'll just be hanging out there saying,
[59:04] "I want somebody let me in. Somebody let
[59:07] me in. I want to do something. Let me
[59:09] in." The only way he could mess up the
[59:12] service if somebody yields to him.
[59:16] Yeah.
[59:19] Cuz God comes and he says, "Uh, Satan,
[59:21] what you doing?" He says, "Hey, I'm
[59:23] walking to and fro." And then God points
[59:25] you out and say, "Have you considered my
[59:27] servant?"
[59:29] And listen to the devil's response. He
[59:31] said, "Yes, I have, but you got a hedge
[59:34] around him. I can't get to him without
[59:36] your permission."
[59:40] So sometimes God gives the devil
[59:43] consent.
[59:49] Oh my why am I going through this? Why
[59:52] is this happening?
[59:54] Everything is not the devil.
[59:58] Sometimes it's God making you a better
[1:00:00] person.
[1:00:01] Sometimes it's God awakening things that
[1:00:04] were lying dormant in you that was
[1:00:06] supposed to be quickened. Hallelujah.
[1:00:09] Job was a or God testified about him. He
[1:00:12] said he's a righteous man. There's
[1:00:13] nothing like him in all the earth. God
[1:00:15] had a a a testimony service concerning
[1:00:18] Job. But that trial brought out
[1:00:20] something in Job. Hallelujah. That was
[1:00:23] hiding there all that time.
[1:00:27] So God even let the enemy have consent.
[1:00:31] He will. The prophet of God says it like
[1:00:33] this. God will allow it.
[1:00:37] Why? To bring out more of who he is.
[1:00:41] Woo. That's why we had a fall so that
[1:00:44] God could bring out more of who he is.
[1:00:49] Are you with me?
[1:00:52] Listen,
[1:00:55] I'm going to change gears a little bit.
[1:00:56] Let's beat up on the enemy a little bit.
[1:00:59] Listen,
[1:01:03] Satan is only as strong as you make him.
[1:01:06] Amen.
[1:01:09] Whatever you want to call him, the
[1:01:10] devil, Lucifer, the dragon, whatever.
[1:01:12] He's only as strong as you make him. Or
[1:01:16] you let him be.
[1:01:19] Think about that. Hallelujah. The only
[1:01:23] power he has is your consent.
[1:01:27] Again, what is consent? To permit.
[1:01:31] How many of us have permitted ourselves
[1:01:33] to be sick?
[1:01:38] When God is already the healer,
[1:01:42] he says approve or agree. How many of us
[1:01:45] agree with the enemy sometimes
[1:01:50] I think
[1:01:53] I think I'm coming down with you
[1:01:55] certainly are.
[1:01:57] You certainly are. The prophet of God
[1:02:00] said it's a thought first.
[1:02:05] It's a thought first and then once it
[1:02:07] comes out of your mouth, I believe such
[1:02:10] and such is coming over me, you give
[1:02:12] that spirit consent to enter into your
[1:02:15] body. Think about it. That's why the
[1:02:18] word of God says cast down imagination.
[1:02:23] The Bible says re resist the devil.
[1:02:26] Hallelujah. See, we have the ability to
[1:02:29] tell the devil spiritually and naturally
[1:02:32] no.
[1:02:34] No, I'm not going to be sick. No, I'm
[1:02:38] not going to be depressed. No.
[1:02:44] Hallelujah.
[1:02:45] And I hope this is uh uh for some of you
[1:02:49] who are are are are
[1:02:51] deep
[1:02:53] elementary tonight
[1:02:56] because a lot of times we miss God
[1:02:58] because we looking for something way out
[1:03:00] here. Oh yeah, preacher. And my and my
[1:03:02] pastor like to say we overreaching the
[1:03:04] thing that we need and it's right there
[1:03:06] in our face.
[1:03:09] It's right there. Your deliverance is
[1:03:11] right here in your face tonight.
[1:03:13] Hallelujah.
[1:03:15] It's to whomever which side you wants to
[1:03:17] give or you want to permit.
[1:03:22] Hallelujah.
[1:03:24] Amen. Like we was riding. We was riding.
[1:03:28] We was talking about different things
[1:03:30] the other day. And brother Homer made a
[1:03:32] statement
[1:03:34] cuz cuz you know he's up in age. He's
[1:03:35] one of our season pillars. And he made a
[1:03:38] statement. He said, "I refuse to go out
[1:03:39] with dementia."
[1:03:42] He said, "I" he said, "I ain't going out
[1:03:44] like that." Said, "I ain't going out
[1:03:46] like that. I ain't going out with a loss
[1:03:48] of memory and all that stuff." He said,
[1:03:49] "I rather the Lord take me than for me
[1:03:51] to be walking around, what am I to do
[1:03:53] today?"
[1:03:55] See, he's already cast that spirit down.
[1:03:59] Hallelujah. So if dementia tries to run,
[1:04:02] Hallelujah. Come his way. Come all the
[1:04:05] way down to Alabama.
[1:04:07] Is I think it's coming from my way. I
[1:04:10] think it's the Lincolnington exit.
[1:04:12] Hallelujah. Come down to the Lincoln
[1:04:14] exit. Say, "Oh, I'm going down there
[1:04:15] where Homer at." There's a There's a
[1:04:18] spiritual angel that'll stop him and
[1:04:21] tell him, "You don't have consent."
[1:04:25] Hallelujah. You don't have consent,
[1:04:27] church. You say, "Bro, what are you
[1:04:29] talking about?" is scriptural.
[1:04:30] Hallelujah. When the death angel started
[1:04:33] to ride, hallelujah. Every house that
[1:04:35] had the blood, death didn't have
[1:04:37] consent. So when the angel the death
[1:04:40] angel tried to step in that house,
[1:04:42] hallelujah, there was an angel there.
[1:04:45] There was an angel standing at every
[1:04:47] door where the blood was applied. So the
[1:04:50] death angel couldn't come in. Why?
[1:04:52] Because the angel of life was there.
[1:04:55] Because the blood was written over that
[1:04:57] house. Amen.
[1:05:00] Death doesn't have consent to take a
[1:05:02] child in my house. Why? Because of the
[1:05:05] blood.
[1:05:08] Think about that. See, I think I think
[1:05:10] what we're missing, what the message of
[1:05:13] the hour has been doing all this time is
[1:05:16] not producing more spiritual knowledge,
[1:05:18] but what it's been doing is putting us
[1:05:20] back in position.
[1:05:23] Hallelujah.
[1:05:25] Cuz the capping off of the bride is her
[1:05:27] adoption.
[1:05:29] Hallelujah.
[1:05:33] It ain't so much as us knowing what
[1:05:36] brother Brandham said, but it's being in
[1:05:39] position to fulfill what he said.
[1:05:42] Hallelujah.
[1:05:44] But look,
[1:05:46] when we think about
[1:05:48] the enemy and how he operates,
[1:05:51] see, that's why certain certain stuff I
[1:05:54] don't do because I know I know the devil
[1:05:56] don't like me. You know,
[1:06:00] Josh, that's why I ain't get down this
[1:06:01] morning because, you know, the enemy
[1:06:03] probably want to try to do something
[1:06:04] crazy
[1:06:06] and then I won't be able to preach
[1:06:07] tonight.
[1:06:09] So, I'm very I'm very aware of
[1:06:12] Hallelujah. You know, the prophet of God
[1:06:14] say the enemy studies us.
[1:06:17] Hallelujah. He watches your life. He
[1:06:20] watches what you read. He watches what
[1:06:21] you listen to. Hallelujah. He watches
[1:06:23] how it affects you. And all he's doing
[1:06:26] is waiting for an opportunity.
[1:06:28] Hallelujah. For you to give him consent
[1:06:30] where he can take that thing to the next
[1:06:32] level.
[1:06:36] Hallelujah.
[1:06:38] Listen, I love this quote. This is out
[1:06:39] of one of my favorite messages,
[1:06:42] the fundamental foundation of faith. Are
[1:06:44] you with me?
[1:06:46] Y'all doing real good. I just leave my
[1:06:48] sign. I just leave it over here tonight.
[1:06:50] Y'all doing real good by the grace of
[1:06:52] God. Hallelujah. I I should have had one
[1:06:55] tonight and say hallelujah
[1:06:58] cuz we doing real good tonight, Brandon.
[1:07:00] Praise God.
[1:07:02] Listen what the prophet of God says. He
[1:07:04] says and and and as I'm reading this, I
[1:07:07] want you to listen and see
[1:07:10] sometimes how simple your battles are.
[1:07:14] Hallelujah. I want you to know tonight,
[1:07:18] you are in control.
[1:07:23] The devil's not in control. You are in
[1:07:25] control. You make God who he is. You
[1:07:30] make him savior. You make him Lord. You
[1:07:32] make him deliverer.
[1:07:34] [Applause]
[1:07:36] It's according to your need that God can
[1:07:38] be that attribute.
[1:07:41] [Applause]
[1:07:43] Hallelujah. I don't know about you, but
[1:07:45] I need you. I need him.
[1:07:47] Hallelujah. I need Jehovah Gyra.
[1:07:50] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Some of us need
[1:07:53] Jehovah Rafa tonight. But you make him
[1:07:56] that. Your need makes him that. Now,
[1:07:58] will you give him consent to be that in
[1:08:00] your life? Hallelujah. Me needing him as
[1:08:03] Jehovah John ain't me getting four or
[1:08:06] five jobs, but it's me believing that
[1:08:08] he's a provider.
[1:08:11] [Music]
[1:08:13] And him being Jehovah Rafa is not about
[1:08:16] you connecting with a good doctor.
[1:08:20] But it's allowing him to be your healer,
[1:08:22] which he's already is.
[1:08:26] Now, I'm not speaking against doctors,
[1:08:28] but you know what I mean.
[1:08:30] Hallelujah. Some of us, we'd rather get
[1:08:33] the prescription
[1:08:35] before we get the prayer.
[1:08:37] Because we, you know why we do that? We
[1:08:39] feel more safe with the prescription.
[1:08:45] Because if something happens, you can
[1:08:46] blame it on the doctor.
[1:08:50] But if you pray about it and nothing
[1:08:52] happens, then you got to get down and
[1:08:54] mean business with God.
[1:08:56] See, so the easy way out is put it on
[1:08:58] the doctor.
[1:09:01] But I think God is calling us to step up
[1:09:04] higher and have a more intimate
[1:09:06] relationship with him. Hallelujah.
[1:09:10] Listen, listen what the prophet of God
[1:09:11] says. This is in the fundamental
[1:09:13] foundation.
[1:09:15] He says now Satan
[1:09:18] by the laws of sin sin has a law.
[1:09:23] He said by the law the laws of sin and
[1:09:26] death makes everything that sin and
[1:09:28] death bought operate
[1:09:32] my there's a law hallelujah within sin
[1:09:36] and death that'll operate in your life
[1:09:38] if you give it consent. That's right.
[1:09:44] He says, "And Satan sends a cancer." And
[1:09:47] listen what happens. The man recognizes
[1:09:51] it, receives it.
[1:09:55] The devil sends cancer, you recognize
[1:09:58] it. And receiving it is you giving it
[1:10:01] consent.
[1:10:04] What if the devil sends the cancer, you
[1:10:06] recognize it, and you say, "By stripes
[1:10:08] I'm healed." Amen. Amen.
[1:10:12] Hallelujah. What are you doing then?
[1:10:14] There's only two spirits you can give
[1:10:16] permission to. Same channel. Hallelujah.
[1:10:20] The channel of cancer comes. You can
[1:10:22] either receive it. Hallelujah. By the
[1:10:24] way of the spirit, by the laws of God or
[1:10:27] by the laws of sin. Hallelujah.
[1:10:31] And look, when it comes, Hallelujah. He
[1:10:33] says, he says Satan sends uh cancer. He
[1:10:37] said the man recognizes it, receives it.
[1:10:40] Satan sends heartache. We recognize it
[1:10:42] and receive it.
[1:10:46] So I say tonight, if you're depressed,
[1:10:50] it's because you received the spirit.
[1:10:54] You gave that spirit consent.
[1:10:56] Hallelujah.
[1:10:58] To bring you down.
[1:11:01] You don't have to be that way.
[1:11:05] What if depression comes? Hallelujah.
[1:11:08] You say the joy of the Lord is my
[1:11:11] strength.
[1:11:13] See, there's a channel you can receive.
[1:11:15] There's a channel you can you can put
[1:11:17] the the word of consent in. You can give
[1:11:20] consent for God to move or you can give
[1:11:22] consent for the devil to move. It's up
[1:11:24] to you on how you want to live life.
[1:11:30] Everybody with me? Yes. Listen. He says
[1:11:33] whatever the devil says, he says we
[1:11:35] recognize it and then we receive it. And
[1:11:39] then that law, hallelujah, of whatever
[1:11:41] you receive operates in your life.
[1:11:48] He said, and this is what I love. He
[1:11:50] says, "And if Satan by his power can
[1:11:53] make his laws work in man, how much more
[1:11:56] God?"
[1:11:59] I got about three amens on that one.
[1:12:03] You see what I'm saying? We'll recognize
[1:12:06] what the devil is doing and we'll amen
[1:12:08] it. But then when it comes to the things
[1:12:10] of God, it's like we ponder over it.
[1:12:14] Can you really, Lord? Goodness.
[1:12:19] We we we we we we we turn into
[1:12:21] mannequins and we start saying instead
[1:12:22] of saying yes Lord, we say
[1:12:31] church, the things of God
[1:12:35] can operate in our life just as easy
[1:12:40] as the laws of sin and death.
[1:12:43] But it's up to you whether you'll give
[1:12:45] it consent or not. I like Hallelujah.
[1:12:48] Super Rebecca. I got a I got a quote
[1:12:49] where the prophet of God says. He says,
[1:12:51] "Hallelujah. Receiving Hallelujah." He
[1:12:54] said, "Be things are are just as easy to
[1:12:57] receive as small things."
[1:13:02] Hallelujah. But how many of us go to God
[1:13:05] giving God consent to be a big God?
[1:13:10] We'll go to God. Y'all know me. We'll go
[1:13:12] to God say, "Lord, you know, I just need
[1:13:14] me a little car to get to work." And
[1:13:15] that what you get a little piece of junk
[1:13:19] cuz that what you asked for.
[1:13:23] Well, you say, "Lord, I need me
[1:13:24] something nice.
[1:13:27] Lord, Lord, I know you you are God. You
[1:13:31] want to count on a thousand hills."
[1:13:33] Hallelujah. You created the worlds.
[1:13:35] Lord, I know you can just bless me with
[1:13:37] a 20 25 Honda.
[1:13:43] Hallelujah.
[1:13:48] Y'all know, y'all know I wanted to say
[1:13:50] Maserati, but I'mma give y'all a break
[1:13:51] on that one.
[1:13:54] Hallelujah.
[1:13:55] But that's what I believe. I believe God
[1:13:57] can do it. I believe I believe that my
[1:14:00] God h I give him consent to be the
[1:14:03] biggest he want to be in my life. The
[1:14:05] prophet of God said, "How could we ever
[1:14:07] think we can exhaust God?"
[1:14:09] He say it's like having a spoon taking
[1:14:11] some water out of the ocean and you're
[1:14:13] like, "Oh, I didn't talk too much."
[1:14:21] Listen.
[1:14:24] He says, "And if Satan by his spirit can
[1:14:28] make his laws work in man, how much more
[1:14:30] of God
[1:14:32] with his power make his laws work in
[1:14:35] man?" Can I get an amen, church? He
[1:14:37] says, "If Satan can make his laws be
[1:14:40] sure," listen, he said, "You can make
[1:14:41] his laws be be sure." Some people go to
[1:14:44] the doctor and the doctor say, "Well, I
[1:14:46] don't see nothing." You'll be like, "You
[1:14:47] can't. I'm going to get a second
[1:14:48] opinion.
[1:14:50] I want this sickness bad.
[1:15:02] I don't know about you. I go to the
[1:15:04] doctor, they don't tell me they see
[1:15:05] nothing." I'm like, "Praise God. don't
[1:15:07] go on. I don't care how my body feel.
[1:15:09] Praise God. You don't see nothing.
[1:15:11] Normally, they don't see nothing. It's
[1:15:13] the devil waiting to get consent.
[1:15:17] That's why the pain is still there
[1:15:19] because he's waiting for you to accept
[1:15:21] it. And once you accept it, the next
[1:15:23] time you go take that X-ray, that lump
[1:15:25] will be there
[1:15:28] cuz you gave it permission to become
[1:15:30] visible.
[1:15:32] Oh, Jesus Christ.
[1:15:35] My I hope you're understanding me
[1:15:37] tonight, church. Hallelujah. Satan is a
[1:15:40] tool in God's hands, and all he can do
[1:15:43] is what we allow him to do.
[1:15:49] Now, I say that about Satan, but it's
[1:15:51] also the same about God. Very
[1:15:55] good. That's why he made us free more
[1:15:58] agents
[1:15:59] because he's not going to make us do
[1:16:02] anything, which he could.
[1:16:05] He could at the drop of a dime. He could
[1:16:07] make us do anything. But then because
[1:16:10] God is a lover, he's like, "No, he wants
[1:16:12] consent.
[1:16:14] He wants to know that you really
[1:16:16] understand who he is." Hallelujah. He
[1:16:19] wants you. He wants to know that you're
[1:16:21] really in love with him. And you give
[1:16:23] him consent to to to sit on the throne
[1:16:26] of your heart. You give him consent to
[1:16:28] control the battleground of your mind.
[1:16:32] You give him consent to live through you
[1:16:34] with the power of the Holy Ghost. Yes,
[1:16:36] Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:16:39] Thank you, Lord.
[1:16:41] Hallelujah.
[1:16:44] Praise the Lord. And I'm going back and
[1:16:46] forth because I want you to realize that
[1:16:49] tonight in your life, you've given
[1:16:52] consent to one of those spirits.
[1:16:55] Thank you, Lord.
[1:16:58] Say, "The devil made me do it." No, he
[1:17:00] didn't.
[1:17:02] The devil saying you made him do it.
[1:17:08] He run back to God said, "Why your
[1:17:10] people keep lying on lying on me? Only
[1:17:12] thing I'm doing is what they ask me to
[1:17:14] do.
[1:17:20] Are you with me?
[1:17:23] If Satan can make his laws be sure and
[1:17:26] us recognize it, how much more are God
[1:17:30] through his children to make his laws be
[1:17:33] recognized among his people of divine
[1:17:36] healing, revelation, power, gifts,
[1:17:38] manifestation of the spirit.
[1:17:41] What he's saying is everything that God
[1:17:43] is and we can recognize what the enemy
[1:17:45] does in his flesh, we should also be
[1:17:47] able to recognize what God is doing in
[1:17:49] our spirit and receive it.
[1:17:55] They that come to God must first believe
[1:17:57] that he is.
[1:18:01] He is tonight, church. Hallelujah. If
[1:18:04] you don't remember anything tonight when
[1:18:06] you walk out of here, get in your car on
[1:18:08] the way home, I want you to say to
[1:18:10] yourself, "God is."
[1:18:12] God is. Get in the mirror and say, "God
[1:18:15] is." As you eating your food, God is. As
[1:18:18] you're putting on your clothes, God is.
[1:18:22] When you walk in the bank, say, "God
[1:18:24] is." When you walk to the doctor, say,
[1:18:26] "God is."
[1:18:29] Yes, Lord. He's a rewarder. Amen. Thank
[1:18:34] you, Lord.
[1:18:36] Thank you, Lord.
[1:18:39] The saddest thing I see is,
[1:18:45] and I I don't just want to limit it to
[1:18:47] the message, but the saddest thing I see
[1:18:49] is in church, all the revelation we have
[1:18:54] concerning God that's been revealed in
[1:18:56] our day, and people be sitting right in
[1:18:58] church with no joy.
[1:19:02] It's just become a religious show up.
[1:19:07] Lord, all the things that God has done,
[1:19:09] all that's been revealed. I challenge
[1:19:11] you, church, you want you want to feel a
[1:19:13] little uncction about yourself, go back
[1:19:15] and listen to the fundamental foundation
[1:19:16] of of of a faith
[1:19:19] where the prophet begins to talk about
[1:19:21] when God created man, he created him
[1:19:23] superior.
[1:19:26] He created him to control, have
[1:19:28] dominion. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's
[1:19:31] how God created us. You say, "Well,
[1:19:34] brother D, I don't feel like that."
[1:19:35] That's because you're receiving the
[1:19:36] attribute of sin.
[1:19:39] Sin was the only thing that changed
[1:19:41] that. But then Jesus Christ came.
[1:19:44] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Gave his life,
[1:19:46] death, burial, resurrection, and he took
[1:19:49] that power away.
[1:19:51] He took the power of sin away, and he
[1:19:53] put us back in the place to be children
[1:19:56] of God again.
[1:19:59] So when you accept him as your savior,
[1:20:01] as your lord, you give God consent,
[1:20:04] hallelujah, to put you back in Eden
[1:20:06] again.
[1:20:12] Hallelujah.
[1:20:16] You know what? I'm to a place
[1:20:19] where I'm not worried about what
[1:20:20] somebody else is doing. I just want to
[1:20:23] make sure I'm where I supposed to be.
[1:20:25] Amen. I ain't worried about who come to
[1:20:27] church and who don't come to church.
[1:20:29] Long as when I come here, my log is lit.
[1:20:34] Lit. Somebody say it with me. Lit.
[1:20:37] When we come to the house of God, we
[1:20:39] want to be.
[1:20:46] That's right. The Bible said, "Oh, let
[1:20:48] me stop. I'm going to another message.
[1:20:50] Let me stop."
[1:20:51] Hallelujah.
[1:20:54] Listen.
[1:20:55] Everybody all right?
[1:20:58] He says, "When Jesus knocked at my
[1:21:00] heart, I let him in." Well, that's good.
[1:21:04] But when he comes into your heart, did
[1:21:07] you welcome him to your entire being?
[1:21:14] That mean God, you can have me and do
[1:21:16] whatever you will. That's the reason why
[1:21:18] a lot of people don't want the Holy
[1:21:19] Ghost because the Holy Ghost, the only
[1:21:22] way you can have it is is is if it
[1:21:25] dominates you.
[1:21:30] Hallelujah. Because it's the life of
[1:21:33] Christ and too many of us don't want to
[1:21:35] be dominated. That's why we got this
[1:21:36] thing going around. You hear people say,
[1:21:38] you know, you ask somebody and say, "Are
[1:21:40] you a church boy? Are you religious?"
[1:21:41] No, I'm spiritual. Huh?
[1:21:44] How you going to have religion?
[1:21:47] How you going to be spiritual without
[1:21:48] any kind of order of religion?
[1:21:52] But people will say they spiritual so
[1:21:54] they can still live in sin and do
[1:21:56] whatever they want to do. But then
[1:21:57] they'll say, "I pray. I believe in God."
[1:21:59] But do you live for him?
[1:22:02] That's the difference. If you're really
[1:22:05] spiritual, you'll give your life to live
[1:22:07] for him. Hallelujah. Don't give me all
[1:22:10] this. I'm spiritual and you still out
[1:22:12] there doing all the stuff in the world
[1:22:13] that you would do without even knowing
[1:22:15] God.
[1:22:19] I'm spiritual. Yeah, you spiritual. All
[1:22:21] right.
[1:22:27] There's many people that will welcome
[1:22:29] Jesus in as savior, but can he be your
[1:22:33] lord? Lord is ownership.
[1:22:38] You know, and some of us, and I'm not
[1:22:40] fussing, some of us our own pride won't
[1:22:43] let our own pride won't let God have
[1:22:46] ownership.
[1:22:50] It's like a husband walk up to his wife
[1:22:52] and say, "Honey, you know I own you,
[1:22:53] don't you?" No, you don't either. You
[1:22:55] don't own me. My daddy don't even own
[1:22:58] Nobody own me. You right. Nobody.
[1:23:01] Nobody.
[1:23:03] You out there all by yourself, nobody.
[1:23:09] But what if Jesus comes and says, "Hey,
[1:23:11] I want ownership."
[1:23:13] You say, "Okay, God, I accept you as
[1:23:15] savior." He said, "No, I'm not not just
[1:23:17] savior. I want your heart.
[1:23:20] I want your mind. I want your ears and
[1:23:23] your eyes. Everything spiritually that
[1:23:25] you can connect with, I want that to be
[1:23:28] mine.
[1:23:30] Hallelujah. That's ownership.
[1:23:36] Yeah, we done been baptized.
[1:23:40] Come to church and we are the
[1:23:43] generation.
[1:23:45] We are the converation.
[1:23:49] Yeah. We get up, we sing, sing nice
[1:23:51] spiritual anointed songs. But is God
[1:23:54] sitting there?
[1:23:57] Does he have ownership? is that song of
[1:24:00] revelation.
[1:24:04] Hallelujah.
[1:24:06] And Paul know I love his music.
[1:24:10] Hallelujah.
[1:24:12] Listen.
[1:24:16] He said the Lord has complete control.
[1:24:19] You would
[1:24:22] plentilally welcome him to keep you out
[1:24:25] of hell and torment. Amen.
[1:24:28] We all would accept a God like that
[1:24:30] that'll keep me out of hell.
[1:24:32] But living for God has to be bigger than
[1:24:34] that.
[1:24:37] You just scared of going to hell. That's
[1:24:39] all. Come on. You got to be bigger than
[1:24:40] that. Hallelujah. There's a lot of
[1:24:43] people out there scared of going to
[1:24:44] hell, but they won't live for God. They
[1:24:46] won't serve for God. Hallelujah. That's
[1:24:48] why things happen. They get in car
[1:24:50] crashes. They get sick. They get healed.
[1:24:52] and they go back to doing whatever they
[1:24:54] was doing
[1:24:56] because they'll accept him as a healer,
[1:24:58] as a savior, as a deliverer, but they
[1:25:00] won't let him have ownership. They don't
[1:25:02] give him full consent.
[1:25:10] He said, "You, oh my." He said, "The
[1:25:13] Lord had complete control. Would you
[1:25:16] would you keep him out of hell or
[1:25:17] torment?" He said you would welcome him
[1:25:19] as your savior but as but are you
[1:25:21] willing to welcome him as your lord and
[1:25:23] take over your full take over full
[1:25:26] control in the heart there's little
[1:25:28] doors hallelujah like in the house if I
[1:25:32] come to your house to visit you and
[1:25:34] welcome you and you say brother Brandham
[1:25:36] I give you like this the house and all
[1:25:38] that's within it but then you take me by
[1:25:41] the hand and you say you see this door I
[1:25:45] don't want you going in pray. Come on
[1:25:48] now. See, that doesn't mean you have
[1:25:49] full complete consent of the house. I'm
[1:25:52] restricted. Is God restricted tonight?
[1:25:55] Is he restricted in your heart? Is he
[1:25:58] restricted in your mind? Is he
[1:26:00] restricted? Hallelujah. In your habits,
[1:26:05] or does he have full consent?
[1:26:07] That's right.
[1:26:11] What I'm saying is if God doesn't have
[1:26:14] full power and consent, that means
[1:26:16] you've given it to the enemy.
[1:26:24] He said, "And you see this place now,
[1:26:26] don't go in there and this place, don't
[1:26:29] go in there. Then I'm just partially
[1:26:32] welcome." My Is God partially welcome
[1:26:35] tonight in your spirit?
[1:26:37] He said, "And that's the way people
[1:26:39] usually receive the Lord as partially
[1:26:42] welcome, but he wants to come in and be
[1:26:46] welcome."
[1:26:48] Amen. And we examine ourselves tonight
[1:26:51] and we say, "God, does God really have
[1:26:54] full reign over my being?
[1:26:57] Does he have full consent?" Hallelujah.
[1:27:02] Consent, permit. Hallelujah. Have we
[1:27:05] permitted God to have ownership?
[1:27:08] Have you approved it?
[1:27:11] No, I ain't doing that. I belong to God.
[1:27:15] Hallelujah. Or agree. And that's the
[1:27:17] thing about it right there. Hallelujah.
[1:27:20] A lot of times we don't give full
[1:27:22] consent is because we're not agreeing
[1:27:25] with it.
[1:27:28] I'mma put this out there. I'm going to
[1:27:30] say it. I'mma stump on the devil's head.
[1:27:32] There's nothing wrong with the message.
[1:27:34] Amen. The thing is people spiritually
[1:27:37] didn't agree with it.
[1:27:40] Things in their heart didn't agree with
[1:27:42] it. Things in their lifestyle didn't
[1:27:45] agree with it. See, I'll put it in a
[1:27:48] nutshell. The reason why people have a
[1:27:50] problem with the which is the message is
[1:27:52] what the revelation of Jesus Christ. The
[1:27:55] reason why people have a problem with it
[1:27:57] is because they don't agree with Christ
[1:27:59] having full dominion and reign over
[1:28:01] their lives.
[1:28:03] And the message of the hour, hallelujah,
[1:28:06] don't give consent for you. Hallelujah.
[1:28:08] To say you holy and then walk around on
[1:28:11] the beach with a song.
[1:28:15] It's true.
[1:28:16] Hallelujah.
[1:28:18] And that's the reason why we have
[1:28:20] Hallelujah. People saying, "Well, I'm
[1:28:22] free. I'm this." Yeah, you're free
[1:28:23] because you can be what you want to be
[1:28:25] now.
[1:28:28] Hallelujah.
[1:28:30] Hallelujah.
[1:28:34] Oh my. And I love this part. The word
[1:28:38] consent also means to comply.
[1:28:42] I'll get in step with it.
[1:28:45] As much as it may be hard for me, God,
[1:28:48] I'mma surrender this part of my life to
[1:28:50] you. I'm going to let you take over it.
[1:28:53] God, I will comply. No matter how out of
[1:28:57] step I might be, Lord, I want to get in
[1:28:59] step.
[1:29:01] I will comply. I will give myself to you
[1:29:05] that you can take control of this human
[1:29:08] machine and make it do what you want it
[1:29:10] to do. I will comply.
[1:29:13] Like they say in the military, sir. Yes,
[1:29:15] sir.
[1:29:18] That's what we ought to be doing
[1:29:19] spiritually when it comes to God. And he
[1:29:21] says, "Hey, hey, you've been doing this.
[1:29:24] You've been on social media long enough.
[1:29:25] Now it's time to go pray, sir." Yes,
[1:29:27] sir.
[1:29:29] You've been watching this a little too
[1:29:31] long. Now it's time to give me some
[1:29:32] praise. Sir, yes, sir. You've gave me 40
[1:29:36] hours on the job. Now it's time to go to
[1:29:38] church and participate. Say yes, sir.
[1:29:46] No matter how mad them soldiers might
[1:29:48] be, they still got to stay in step.
[1:29:52] They could be under their breath. My my
[1:29:54] sergeant make me mad. Make me sick. I
[1:29:56] can't let them down here. Get on my
[1:29:58] nerves.
[1:30:01] Get on my You always messing with me.
[1:30:04] I'm so sick of marching, but he don't
[1:30:06] stop marching.
[1:30:09] He's giving consent
[1:30:12] to be a part of that army.
[1:30:16] So, he has to comply with everything
[1:30:18] about that army. You've given consent to
[1:30:22] be a part of the army of the Lord. So
[1:30:24] you've got to comply,
[1:30:29] sir. Yes, sir.
[1:30:32] Now, the young people going to remember
[1:30:33] that one,
[1:30:36] honey, did you clean your room, sir?
[1:30:38] Yes, sir.
[1:30:41] Did you do your homework, sir? Yes, sir.
[1:30:45] [Laughter]
[1:30:47] Hallelujah. Don't get nervous. I'm about
[1:30:50] to close.
[1:30:52] Let's go back.
[1:30:54] So hopefully we understand what consent
[1:30:56] is. Let me let me let me let me read you
[1:30:59] something else.
[1:31:01] Listen,
[1:31:06] I want to see the people of God free.
[1:31:11] I don't preach for fame or fortune.
[1:31:14] Hallelujah. But I pray God use the gift
[1:31:17] to bring his people closer.
[1:31:20] Amen. that when we speak, I've given God
[1:31:23] so much consent that you don't see me,
[1:31:25] you see him. Hallelujah. That when you
[1:31:28] hear Hallelujah, what I'm saying, when
[1:31:31] it's repeated back into your
[1:31:33] consciousness and you hear your voice,
[1:31:34] but you hear God telling you to do it.
[1:31:36] That's right. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:31:39] But when I when I when I when I think
[1:31:41] about it, church, and I think about the
[1:31:44] yielding to the spirit, Hallelujah. It's
[1:31:47] not as hard as we make it to be.
[1:31:51] It's just the fact that you yielding
[1:31:53] yourself and say, "Lord, here am I."
[1:31:58] Look,
[1:32:01] oh, I love this, brother Paul. It ain't
[1:32:03] up to me to prove that God is a
[1:32:07] provider.
[1:32:10] That's who he is. I give him consent to
[1:32:13] prove it.
[1:32:15] Hallelujah. It ain't up to you to prove
[1:32:17] that God is a healer. Amen. It's up to
[1:32:20] God to prove that because he called
[1:32:22] himself the healer. Hallelujah. It ain't
[1:32:25] up to us to prove hallelujah. God's joy,
[1:32:28] God's peace, everything about God. No,
[1:32:30] we give him consent. God be that to me.
[1:32:33] So, it's up to God to prove who he is.
[1:32:35] His reputation is on the line.
[1:32:39] And we have to ask ourselves, how many
[1:32:41] of us really think God will fail you if
[1:32:44] his reputation is on the line?
[1:32:46] [Applause]
[1:32:48] Good preaching. Yes, sir.
[1:32:56] Listen,
[1:32:57] I want you to catch this.
[1:33:00] One thing I love talking about is
[1:33:01] confession.
[1:33:04] Confession is a powerful tool given to
[1:33:06] the believer.
[1:33:09] Love is powerful. Faith is powerful. But
[1:33:11] confession,
[1:33:14] confession strips the devil from any
[1:33:16] power he may have ever had over you.
[1:33:19] Once you confess it and say, "God, I
[1:33:20] give it to you. Satan is done.
[1:33:23] He have no more cons." You say, "Oh,
[1:33:25] brother D, I smoked last night." You
[1:33:27] say, "Lord, I want you to take this away
[1:33:30] from me.
[1:33:32] I'm sick of these cigarettes. I'm
[1:33:34] sicker.
[1:33:39] Please don't turn the blood hound loose.
[1:33:44] If you got a problem with a little
[1:33:45] cigarette tonight, you can be delivered.
[1:33:48] And it's not according to me, but it's
[1:33:50] according to your consent.
[1:33:52] That's right. Because there's people
[1:33:54] here who's giving God consent to deliver
[1:33:57] them from that and they're delivered.
[1:34:00] Hallelujah. So I say that tonight that
[1:34:03] he is
[1:34:06] still the same.
[1:34:09] He didn't change.
[1:34:12] Oh my. Listen, let me read this to you.
[1:34:16] He says, "And I said, now this is a
[1:34:18] story where the prophet is talking about
[1:34:19] the woman who committed adultery and she
[1:34:22] wanted to take that to her grave." You
[1:34:24] know, her husband was in the military
[1:34:25] and she said, "Uh, I'm taking it to the
[1:34:27] grave." And keep in mind, she was a
[1:34:29] Sunday school teacher.
[1:34:33] coming to church, being used of God,
[1:34:36] breaking bread, bringing a Bible open
[1:34:38] with a secret inside.
[1:34:43] A secret so near and dear to her heart.
[1:34:47] It was killing her.
[1:34:50] I don't want I don't need to keep a
[1:34:51] secret that bad where I got to die for
[1:34:53] it. Don't tell me nothing.
[1:34:58] Listen,
[1:35:02] you know, she came to brother said,
[1:35:03] "Bro, I'm dying and this and that. I
[1:35:05] don't know what's happening. You know, I
[1:35:06] need prayer." So, finally, God gave him
[1:35:08] the vision and everything. He said,
[1:35:09] "Hey, you commit you committed adultery
[1:35:12] with your husband while he was overseas.
[1:35:13] You need to go tell me." She said, "Ah,
[1:35:14] no. No, I can't do it. I can't do it. I
[1:35:17] can't do it. What about my children?
[1:35:19] What about my marriage? What about What
[1:35:21] about What about She wasn't giving God
[1:35:23] consent, right?
[1:35:25] Yes, she wanted healing and healing was
[1:35:30] there, but she wasn't willing to receive
[1:35:32] it by the way of confession.
[1:35:40] God wants to do it for you, but are you
[1:35:43] willing to let him do it?
[1:35:46] There are certain laws and certain
[1:35:48] avenues and ways that we must go to see
[1:35:51] God be who he is.
[1:35:53] You got to give God consent
[1:35:56] because if you don't, the devil is still
[1:35:58] there.
[1:36:01] Listen, I'll read it. He says, he said,
[1:36:04] and I say I said that's up to them. I
[1:36:06] don't know. But I said, you never know.
[1:36:09] No matter how much you stream, scream,
[1:36:13] how loud you scream,
[1:36:15] how much you pray,
[1:36:17] that devil's got a legal right to stay
[1:36:21] there.
[1:36:27] and think about what you're going
[1:36:28] through and ask yourself, does the devil
[1:36:32] have a legal right
[1:36:35] to stay in my life doing what he's doing
[1:36:38] right now? Whatever your problem is,
[1:36:40] does he have a legal right?
[1:36:44] The only way he will have a legal right
[1:36:46] is if you haven't given God consent.
[1:36:50] you haven't made your confession to the
[1:36:52] Lord.
[1:36:55] That's the only way the devil can stay
[1:36:57] there.
[1:36:58] That's the only way you can remain his
[1:37:00] property by spiritual law.
[1:37:05] Listen,
[1:37:07] he said that devil's got a legal right
[1:37:09] to stay there and he will stay there,
[1:37:11] too. That's right. He's got a right to
[1:37:14] stay to stay there. Not only that, but
[1:37:17] if you supposed to have done something
[1:37:20] and didn't do it, he has a legal right
[1:37:23] of disobedience.
[1:37:31] And we wonder why we come to church and
[1:37:33] can't get into the service and and just
[1:37:36] don't feel like the spirit moving. Maybe
[1:37:38] you were supposed to do something and
[1:37:39] didn't do it. And that spirit of
[1:37:41] disobedience is on you. And Satan got a
[1:37:44] right to hover over you
[1:37:49] from a spirit of disobedience.
[1:37:51] Now, I want you to understand something
[1:37:54] tonight. This is not calling you out.
[1:37:58] This is deliverance.
[1:38:03] This is stripping Satan from all his
[1:38:04] power. Exactly. Taking away his consent.
[1:38:08] taking away his right to stay in your
[1:38:10] life in sickness and and and and in
[1:38:13] health or whatever else in mind,
[1:38:16] whatever you're troubled in. Hallelujah.
[1:38:18] What we're doing is exposing his tactics
[1:38:20] that you can be free and let God be who
[1:38:23] he is in your life.
[1:38:33] He said he has a legal right of
[1:38:35] disobedience. So there's what it is.
[1:38:38] Hallelujah. Combing that person, you'll
[1:38:41] find out just where the cause is. Then
[1:38:44] you know where to start for the cure.
[1:38:49] Confession is your cure.
[1:38:52] Hallelujah. He said, then you know where
[1:38:54] to start for the cure. See, it's
[1:38:57] unconfessed sins many times. So you so
[1:39:01] you watch what you say. Stumping this
[1:39:03] one out and stumping that one out. See,
[1:39:06] that's right. See, faith will move, but
[1:39:09] not when he's got a legal right.
[1:39:13] You say, "Lord, why you ain't answering
[1:39:14] my prayer?" Maybe Satan has a legal
[1:39:17] right.
[1:39:22] You've given somebody consent.
[1:39:29] Satan. Oh my. This This be blowing me
[1:39:31] away when brother Brown be saying stuff
[1:39:33] like this. He says, "Satan knows his
[1:39:35] rights."
[1:39:39] See, we don't even think about it like
[1:39:41] that. We just say, "Oh, oh, um, the
[1:39:43] Bible say, thou shalt not steal.
[1:39:46] Thou shall not lie. Thou shall not
[1:39:48] commit adultery." It's bigger than that.
[1:39:53] Hallelujah.
[1:39:55] These laws that we operate in naturally
[1:39:58] and spiritually, Hallelujah. It gives
[1:40:00] the enemy a right to stay there, right?
[1:40:04] And he'll be right there smiling at God
[1:40:05] knowing he God can't touch him cuz he
[1:40:08] doesn't have consent. Brother B say he
[1:40:11] knows his rights and he'll stay right
[1:40:13] there.
[1:40:15] Exactly. That's why he said when the
[1:40:18] house is garnished and all washed up,
[1:40:20] he'll be kicked out. Yeah. You can come
[1:40:22] up here and pray. We'll pray about it.
[1:40:24] Hallelujah. And because of who we are as
[1:40:27] men of God, we can come up here and pray
[1:40:29] and push that demon out your life. But
[1:40:31] if you haven't confessed your sins,
[1:40:33] you've given him consent to return.
[1:40:38] He say he'll walk in a dry place and he
[1:40:40] say, "You know what? I'm going back to
[1:40:42] my house
[1:40:44] cuz you never confessed that you didn't
[1:40:46] want him there." Wow.
[1:40:53] And I know I I
[1:40:58] let me say this, yield to the spirit
[1:41:01] cuz I know right now we're in the realm
[1:41:02] of demonology
[1:41:05] and we're dealing with spirits. So don't
[1:41:08] look at me and hold on to that evil
[1:41:10] spirit.
[1:41:13] God is trying to set you free. Amen.
[1:41:16] Hallelujah.
[1:41:19] And I can feel them here. I can Oh my I
[1:41:22] can feel the spirits in here tightening
[1:41:23] up trying to get you just to look at the
[1:41:25] preacher when God is saying, "No, I'm
[1:41:28] here.
[1:41:30] Give me consent. To kick the devil out
[1:41:33] your house.
[1:41:36] Hallelujah.
[1:41:39] What we do, we we instead of going free,
[1:41:43] we think about certain terms of of of
[1:41:46] the natural laws like if I go ask for
[1:41:48] prayer, I'm going to be embarrassed.
[1:41:51] It'd be even much more embarrassing with
[1:41:53] the devil sitting in your life, taking
[1:41:54] over your life, destroying your life
[1:41:57] when you could have just said, "God, set
[1:41:58] me free.
[1:42:07] Let me say this.
[1:42:10] Are we good for time? Let me see.
[1:42:15] Praise God. I got about three people say
[1:42:17] keep preaching.
[1:42:20] We ain't been in church two hours yet.
[1:42:22] I remember one time
[1:42:25] before I became a full-time evangelist
[1:42:28] and God was trying to get me there and I
[1:42:30] didn't really understand,
[1:42:32] you know,
[1:42:34] what he wanted from me. So, I kept
[1:42:37] working my job and he kept giving me
[1:42:39] signs to quit, people talking to me,
[1:42:41] saying stuff. I thought you was
[1:42:43] full-time. All these things, you know.
[1:42:46] So, what started to happen to me was I
[1:42:48] was a truck driver. Y'all heard his
[1:42:49] testimony. I was a truck driver. So
[1:42:51] every time I get in the truck, my eyes
[1:42:54] would get heavy where they wouldn't stay
[1:42:56] open and I couldn't drive. So I pull
[1:42:59] over. I said, "Well, I must be getting
[1:43:00] enough sleep." So I try to sit there 15
[1:43:03] minutes and wasn't sleepy.
[1:43:05] So I scraped my eyes open, drive for the
[1:43:07] rest of me, make it home. And it got
[1:43:10] worse and worse.
[1:43:14] Why did it get worse? Because I wasn't
[1:43:16] giving the right spirit consent.
[1:43:19] Hallelujah. So look, finally I I tell my
[1:43:23] boss, uh,
[1:43:26] and be careful what you call people cuz
[1:43:27] they'll manifest the words out of your
[1:43:29] mouth. I used to call my boss Pharaoh.
[1:43:34] And I say, Pharaoh,
[1:43:37] I'm going to the I'm going to the eye
[1:43:39] doctor tomorrow. He said, "You will
[1:43:41] not."
[1:43:43] He's going to operate like what I call
[1:43:45] him, Pharaoh. Not even realize. He said,
[1:43:47] "You will not. If you go to the high
[1:43:50] dollar, you going to be looking for
[1:43:51] another job. I'm like, huh? It didn't
[1:43:54] even make any sense. I'm driving your
[1:43:57] truck with 70,000 lbs on it and you
[1:44:00] don't want me to see
[1:44:04] any sense. But he's just being Pharaoh.
[1:44:08] Wow.
[1:44:10] But he's a tool in God's hands. Because
[1:44:13] my confession was, God, I'm not gonna
[1:44:16] quit. I'm not just going to quit my job.
[1:44:19] You going to have to do something. Don't
[1:44:21] make deals with God.
[1:44:26] Don't Don't Don't try to be all
[1:44:27] spiritual. Make deals with God. Cuz one
[1:44:29] thing about it, God going to keep his
[1:44:31] end of the bargain. And you don't get to
[1:44:34] choose how he's going to make that deal
[1:44:36] come to pass.
[1:44:38] You might feel like you got cheated.
[1:44:43] But you going to do what he want you to
[1:44:44] do. I said, "Lord, I ain't gonna quit,
[1:44:46] but you got to do something." Next thing
[1:44:48] you know, my eyes wouldn't stay open.
[1:44:53] Tell Pharaoh, "I'mma quit." He said,
[1:44:55] "You quit." He, "No." I said, "I'm going
[1:44:57] to the eye doctor." He said, "You go to
[1:44:58] the eye doctor, you'll be looking for
[1:44:59] another job." I like, "Man, that don't
[1:45:02] make no sense. That man going to fire me
[1:45:04] for going to no eye doctor."
[1:45:06] So, I go to the eye doctor.
[1:45:09] Come back the next day, still with no
[1:45:12] solution.
[1:45:14] went to one doctor. He looked at me, did
[1:45:18] all the tests,
[1:45:20] sit down, cross his legs, look at, I do
[1:45:24] not know.
[1:45:26] I do I do I do not know.
[1:45:29] Sometimes you be looking for natural
[1:45:31] answers and it's something spiritual
[1:45:32] taking place. That's true.
[1:45:36] But you know, most of the time doctors
[1:45:38] don't like to be defeated. So he still
[1:45:39] prescribed me something.
[1:45:42] I do not know that'll be $60
[1:45:46] in a prescription. And it is it is so
[1:45:48] crazy what he prescribed. I go to the I
[1:45:51] go to the CVS to get the prescription. I
[1:45:53] get the prescription. It's some nasal
[1:45:55] spray.
[1:45:57] What does that have to do with my eyes?
[1:46:02] Sometimes we look for natural solutions
[1:46:05] from men and it's just don't it just
[1:46:09] ain't going to work.
[1:46:11] The wisdom of man is foolishness to God.
[1:46:15] So you know what? I I got to get in and
[1:46:18] I kept it. And I used to wake up in the
[1:46:20] morning and get in the mirror and say,
[1:46:21] "I do not know."
[1:46:25] But then after that, church, hallelujah,
[1:46:28] God be to like I said, I went back and
[1:46:32] like the man said, I was fired.
[1:46:36] And God let it linger on and linger on.
[1:46:38] And the reason why he let it linger, I
[1:46:40] probably was like that for a month. My
[1:46:41] eyes completely closed. I couldn't
[1:46:43] drive. I couldn't do nothing.
[1:46:47] Couldn't do nothing. I could I could
[1:46:49] stretch my eyes open like this,
[1:46:53] get where I'm going, close my eyes. But
[1:46:56] you can't drive no two hour, three hour
[1:46:58] like you can't you can't drive like
[1:47:00] that. You ain't that strong.
[1:47:03] So anyway, make a long story short, and
[1:47:06] I realized after all of it, after I went
[1:47:08] through it, that God allow it to go that
[1:47:11] long because he knew if I would have got
[1:47:13] my healing like that, I would have went
[1:47:14] and got another job.
[1:47:18] But then church, uh, one day
[1:47:22] you can ask Brother Smiley this. I went
[1:47:24] to go preach with brother Smiley. He
[1:47:26] said, "Hey, come on down here. Make a
[1:47:27] long story short." I said, I said, "I
[1:47:29] can't do it." He said, "What you mean?"
[1:47:30] I said, "Something wrong with my eyes?"
[1:47:32] say, "Man, I got meeting scheduled. You
[1:47:33] better come home."
[1:47:36] And you know, a lot of times people
[1:47:38] can't see or understand what you're
[1:47:40] going through. You know, and people in
[1:47:42] the church be like, "Man, uh, getting
[1:47:44] your quotes about faith and all this."
[1:47:45] He like, "Yeah, leave me alone.
[1:47:49] You understand what I'm going through."
[1:47:51] So, I get all the way down to Okchobee
[1:47:54] and get out the car. Hallelujah. Me and
[1:47:56] my family, I didn't do the driving. My
[1:47:58] wife did all the driving. And then at
[1:48:00] that time, Hallelujah. get out the car.
[1:48:01] Brother Smile said he saw me. He told me
[1:48:04] this. He said he saw me. Check me in.
[1:48:06] Ran to his house and started praying
[1:48:10] cuz I walking around like a zombie. Eyes
[1:48:12] closed. He ain't got
[1:48:15] now. You probably was thinking how we
[1:48:16] going to have meeting. This man ain't
[1:48:18] got his eyes open. But I didn't.
[1:48:23] But one key thing about it God kept
[1:48:25] showing me was every time I tried to
[1:48:27] read my Bible, my eyes stayed open. Wow.
[1:48:33] So that night I came out to preach and
[1:48:36] brother Smiley said, "Holly, everybody
[1:48:38] all right?" Brother Smiley said, "Hey,
[1:48:40] brother D's going through something with
[1:48:41] his eyes." Now all this brother Smiley
[1:48:43] saw it. Brother Jack was there. Brother
[1:48:44] Wesco, all these all these brothers saw
[1:48:47] this testimony. So you can ask them if
[1:48:48] you don't believe it. He said, "Brother
[1:48:51] De's going through something with his
[1:48:52] eyes." He said, "But one thing he don't
[1:48:55] need is no sympathy." Wow. He said, "We
[1:48:58] need a move of God." Right? So, he
[1:49:01] called me out and I stretched my eyes
[1:49:04] over,
[1:49:06] walked out,
[1:49:09] got on the pull pit,
[1:49:12] started reading my Bible, and my eyes
[1:49:15] stayed open, and I preach like I'm doing
[1:49:17] right now. Ran around the place. I had a
[1:49:20] good time. Praise God. Woo! Everything
[1:49:23] was good. I felt like I was healed. And
[1:49:25] as soon as I finished preaching, they
[1:49:27] closed. Wow. Wow.
[1:49:32] My my
[1:49:34] So one day I still didn't understand
[1:49:36] what was going on. But then I start
[1:49:38] putting it together. Whenever I'm doing
[1:49:41] something concerning the ministry, my
[1:49:42] eyes are open. Whenever I try to provide
[1:49:45] for myself, my eyes are closed.
[1:49:50] So one day I got up that morning. And I
[1:49:54] open my eyes, put my face in my Bible, I
[1:49:57] say, "Lord, you knew about this before
[1:49:59] the foundation of the world. Now
[1:50:01] confession time.
[1:50:04] Lord, if you want me to go fulltime in
[1:50:07] the ministry, I accept it today."
[1:50:10] That was the last time my eyes closed
[1:50:12] like that.
[1:50:20] Just a simple confession.
[1:50:23] But a lot of times we don't confess
[1:50:24] because we worried about all the other
[1:50:25] things that come behind it. You know, I
[1:50:28] was worried about my finances and
[1:50:30] providing for the family and all these
[1:50:31] things. The first meeting I went and
[1:50:34] preached, God confirmed that he was my
[1:50:35] provider.
[1:50:37] Cuz I'm thinking about that 40hour
[1:50:39] check. Lord, I need this. So, I preached
[1:50:41] for a brother and he blessed me beyond
[1:50:42] blessings. He He just said he just felt
[1:50:44] led to do it. Wow.
[1:50:47] And it was God confirming, hallelujah,
[1:50:49] that you have made the you've given the
[1:50:52] right one consent.
[1:50:55] Hallelujah. Trust me tonight, if you
[1:50:58] ever give God consent, he will show you
[1:51:00] you've made the right decision.
[1:51:05] But if you don't, the devil will stay
[1:51:07] there.
[1:51:12] And he knew. God knew. Hallelujah. As
[1:51:15] long as I didn't make a confession about
[1:51:18] recepting or receiving what he's had for
[1:51:20] me, the enemy had a right to stay there.
[1:51:25] That's right.
[1:51:27] Now, I'mma close.
[1:51:34] Let me finish reading this.
[1:51:37] Faith will move, but not when he's got a
[1:51:39] legal right. Satan knows what his rights
[1:51:42] is and what he hasn't got a right to.
[1:51:47] That's right. Clean yourself up before
[1:51:50] God and come before him pure and holy.
[1:51:53] Ask then.
[1:51:57] And I'm sure we all got things that we
[1:51:58] want God to do.
[1:52:00] And sometimes it's clear and sometimes
[1:52:02] it's not.
[1:52:04] But the question is, who have you given
[1:52:06] consent to?
[1:52:08] Amen.
[1:52:10] There's a lot of things about God I
[1:52:12] don't understand, but I'm willing to let
[1:52:14] him have dominion.
[1:52:17] I'm willing to let him be Lord.
[1:52:20] There are plenty of times where I don't
[1:52:21] feel like going out and preaching, but I
[1:52:23] I I give myself away to him. I give him
[1:52:27] consent. And you know, Hallelujah.
[1:52:29] Whether you realize it or not.
[1:52:31] Hallelujah. When you give God consent,
[1:52:34] you give God hallelujah the permission
[1:52:37] to bless you.
[1:52:39] That's because he says all things work
[1:52:42] together for what? Good.
[1:52:45] Amen.
[1:52:47] Oh my.
[1:52:50] I'mma close with John five.
[1:52:55] John chapter 5. The man at the pool of
[1:52:58] Bethesda.
[1:53:02] Oh my.
[1:53:12] Say he had a infirmity 38 years.
[1:53:17] He could see the moving of the water. He
[1:53:20] knew it was something special going on,
[1:53:23] but he just couldn't get there in time.
[1:53:26] Can you imagine watching that? Can you
[1:53:29] imagine coming to church and seeing the
[1:53:32] spirit move
[1:53:34] and it pass you by?
[1:53:40] You say, "This one shouted.
[1:53:42] This one raised their hand. This one
[1:53:44] cried. This one sat there in reverence,
[1:53:46] but I didn't feel nothing."
[1:53:52] That's how this man was. He was watching
[1:53:55] people be healed. Can you imagine? He
[1:53:57] was about to put his foot in and
[1:53:59] somebody say,
[1:54:01] "Look next time."
[1:54:05] And get out whole. He see somebody maybe
[1:54:08] with a with a limp or something. Like
[1:54:10] again, the prophet God said, "It don't
[1:54:11] say exactly what his sickness was. He
[1:54:13] just lived with it for 38 years." And he
[1:54:16] was strong enough to try to get up and
[1:54:18] get there, but he wasn't fast enough.
[1:54:21] He said somebody would always jump in
[1:54:23] before him. Imagine that, church. You
[1:54:25] can see the spirit moving, but you can't
[1:54:27] get blessed by it. You know the blessing
[1:54:31] is there, but it's something hindering
[1:54:33] you. Don't be that person tonight.
[1:54:37] Come on, Burke. Kenny, come on.
[1:54:40] This man, he gets there. Hallelujah. He
[1:54:45] sees that the water's troubled like it's
[1:54:47] always been. and he makes his way and
[1:54:49] somebody jumps in and he goes back to
[1:54:53] what he is living under the consent of
[1:54:57] sickness.
[1:55:00] Think about how many times he may have
[1:55:02] said, "Man, I was just that close."
[1:55:06] Another year come, "Man, I was just that
[1:55:08] close."
[1:55:10] But then one year,
[1:55:13] the angel troubles the water. He don't
[1:55:16] make it, but Jesus walks around.
[1:55:20] The Bible say Jesus sees him. And I love
[1:55:23] how the prophet of God say he walks past
[1:55:26] everybody else. It was sick people all
[1:55:29] over the place. It said it was it was uh
[1:55:32] uh those who were blind and lame and uh
[1:55:35] uh different diseases and sicknesses and
[1:55:37] Jesus walked past everybody just to get
[1:55:39] to him.
[1:55:41] My could you be that person tonight?
[1:55:47] But look, we're talking about consent.
[1:55:51] Jesus
[1:55:53] comes up to him
[1:55:55] after the water is troubled and
[1:55:57] everything
[1:55:59] and he asks the man a question. Jesus
[1:56:01] wants consent. Yes.
[1:56:05] He wants consent tonight.
[1:56:08] He knew the man's condition,
[1:56:10] but he wanted the man to allow him to be
[1:56:14] who he is.
[1:56:17] He asked me say, "Will thou be made
[1:56:19] whole?"
[1:56:21] Woo.
[1:56:23] Jesus asked me, "Was he already a
[1:56:25] healer?" Yes, he was. Was he already a
[1:56:28] deliverer? Yes, he was. Did he had the
[1:56:30] power to cast out any demon? Yes, he
[1:56:33] could. Yes. But he want us to realize he
[1:56:38] can do it.
[1:56:40] Yes, sir. He wants you to give him
[1:56:42] consent and drive the devil out. He
[1:56:45] asked the man, "Will thou be made
[1:56:47] whole?" Listen to his response.
[1:56:51] The immortant
[1:56:56] man answered him, "Sir, I have no man."
[1:57:00] Jesus didn't ask him that.
[1:57:02] He asked him, "Will thou be made whole?"
[1:57:06] Don't think about any excuses tonight.
[1:57:08] Answer the question.
[1:57:11] Don't look at your condition. Answer the
[1:57:14] question. He says, "I have no man when
[1:57:17] the water is troubled to put me into the
[1:57:20] pool." Jesus didn't ask him that. Stop
[1:57:24] making excuses. Yes.
[1:57:28] Well, this brother in the message hurt
[1:57:30] me. You know, this pastor hurt me. He
[1:57:34] didn't ask you that. Will you be made
[1:57:37] whole tonight?
[1:57:41] I'm the only one in my family in the
[1:57:43] message. He didn't ask you that. Right.
[1:57:48] Will you be made whole? Stop making
[1:57:51] excuses. Stop blaming on everybody else.
[1:57:54] Do you want to go? Do you want to be
[1:57:55] free from it or not?
[1:57:59] Listen, he says, "I ain't got nobody to
[1:58:00] put me in the pool." He says, "But while
[1:58:02] I am coming, another step down before
[1:58:05] me." Jesus already knew that. That's why
[1:58:08] he asked him, "Would you be made whole?"
[1:58:10] Who do who does who does this man think
[1:58:14] was sending the angel?
[1:58:19] He knew what was taking place.
[1:58:21] God already knew what was taking place.
[1:58:26] We don't have to be all super spiritual
[1:58:28] with God.
[1:58:31] He already knows. Will you allow him to
[1:58:35] be what you need him to be?
[1:58:44] He says, "But while I'm coming another
[1:58:46] step down before me," Jesus said unto
[1:58:49] him, "Rise,
[1:58:51] take up thy bed, and walk." And
[1:58:53] immediately
[1:58:55] the man was made whole and took up his
[1:58:58] bed and walked on the same day was the
[1:59:01] Sabbath.
[1:59:04] As soon as he allowed God to be God,
[1:59:07] yes, he was made whole.
[1:59:12] As soon as he gave God consent,
[1:59:17] his trouble of 38 years,
[1:59:20] how long has that thing been troubling
[1:59:22] you?
[1:59:24] 38 years
[1:59:26] delivered just like that.
[1:59:30] I was in a prayer line one time. A
[1:59:32] sister came up. She said, "Brother De,"
[1:59:33] a sister came up. Brother D said,
[1:59:35] "Brother De, I've been smoking weed for
[1:59:37] 10 years.
[1:59:40] I ain't know.
[1:59:43] The pastor didn't know.
[1:59:45] But she was the word came forth and she
[1:59:47] was making her confession. But what she
[1:59:49] was doing was she was kicking that devil
[1:59:51] out.
[1:59:53] And the husband comes and he say he
[1:59:54] says, "Oh, brother, she she does it, you
[1:59:58] know, for a illness or sickness." I
[2:00:00] wanted to say in the name of get out of
[2:00:05] I want to lay hands on him because he's
[2:00:07] making excuses for the habit. That's it.
[2:00:11] Don't let your loved ones get in the way
[2:00:12] of your deliverance.
[2:00:16] When family comes to be delivered, don't
[2:00:18] you make excuses for your baby.
[2:00:22] Let them go. Oh my. Let them come to
[2:00:25] God.
[2:00:27] But this man, hallelujah, this sister,
[2:00:30] she comes up and she makes her
[2:00:31] confession. She says, "I've been smoking
[2:00:32] weed for 10 years." And her husband
[2:00:34] starts making excuses. Well, brother
[2:00:36] this and that and she's using it for,
[2:00:39] you know, medical reason. I said, man,
[2:00:40] hey, I say, hey, stop that. Don't do
[2:00:42] that. Better yet, you go sit down.
[2:00:45] We don't need you up here to pray. You
[2:00:46] go sit down.
[2:00:49] That's why I'm not a pastor. I'm just
[2:00:51] kind of rude sometimes.
[2:00:57] I ain't arrogant. I just don't have time
[2:00:58] for no foolishness.
[2:01:01] We come to cast out a demon and you want
[2:01:03] it, you want it to stay, man. Just go
[2:01:04] sit down. sit down. We'll deal with you
[2:01:07] later.
[2:01:09] But she she she was making her
[2:01:11] confession. While she was doing it, she
[2:01:12] was crying because she knew the power
[2:01:16] that we had over her. That's it. She
[2:01:20] knew she wasn't using it for the right
[2:01:22] reason. She knew it was now an
[2:01:24] addiction, right? And she wanted
[2:01:27] deliverance.
[2:01:28] And church, we started to praying.
[2:01:31] Hallelujah.
[2:01:33] She didn't do a backwards flip or front
[2:01:34] flip. She didn't scream to the top of
[2:01:37] her lungs. She just raised her hands.
[2:01:39] And you know what she did? She received
[2:01:42] it.
[2:01:44] [Laughter]
[2:01:47] He said, "What happens if we recognize
[2:01:50] God and receive it?
[2:01:53] You will get, hallelujah, the results of
[2:01:56] receiving God just as you would,
[2:01:58] Hallelujah. Recognizing the enemy and
[2:02:01] receiving it, you'll get the results of
[2:02:02] sin and death. What about tonight? If we
[2:02:05] recognize God and receive it,
[2:02:09] she lifted her hands, raised her hands,
[2:02:10] and hallelujah. The testimony came back.
[2:02:13] Hallelujah. She said, "Brother De, I
[2:02:14] can't even remember what it tastes
[2:02:16] like." Hallelujah. G, it's completely
[2:02:19] gone. I have no more craving for it.
[2:02:23] Hallelujah. That's when you know you're
[2:02:25] delivered. There's no more craving for
[2:02:28] it. That's real sanctification
[2:02:32] when the want to is gone.
[2:02:36] You if you one of them people say you
[2:02:38] was delivered and you running off every
[2:02:40] time you get around I can't I
[2:02:45] can't be around that.
[2:02:48] Might still have a little power over
[2:02:49] you.
[2:02:51] When God delivers you, he delivers you.
[2:02:54] Now, I ain't saying tempt yourself, but
[2:02:56] what I'm saying is when you're
[2:02:58] delivered, you're not running from the
[2:03:00] devil.
[2:03:02] You're standing your ground.
[2:03:07] But this man, once he gave God consent,
[2:03:11] he received what God always was
[2:03:16] without the excuses he was making. So,
[2:03:19] if you ask yourself tonight, who have
[2:03:22] you given consent to?
[2:03:26] Who have you given the authority to live
[2:03:28] in your life
[2:03:30] to reign and have dominion?
[2:03:33] Is it God
[2:03:37] or is your spiritual house still a
[2:03:39] playground for the enemy?
[2:03:46] Let's pray.
[2:03:50] Here
[2:04:04] I am to worship.
[2:04:07] Here I am to bow down. Here I am to say
[2:04:15] that you're my God.
[2:04:20] You're all together lovely,
[2:04:26] all together
[2:04:28] worthy,
[2:04:30] all together
[2:04:32] wonderful
[2:04:35] to me.
[2:04:39] Here I am to worship.
[2:04:44] Here I am to bow down. Here I am to say
[2:04:52] that you're my God.
[2:04:57] You're all together

[2:05:05] worthy,
[2:05:07] allto together
[2:05:10] wonderful
[2:05:12] to me.
[2:05:17] Here I am to work worship. Here I am.
[2:05:25] Bow down. Here I am. Say that you're my
[2:05:32] God.
[2:05:34] You're all together lovely.
[2:05:40] All together,
[2:05:44] all together
[2:05:46] wonderful
[2:05:50] to me.
[2:05:53] [Music]
[2:05:58] [Music]
[2:06:10] Let's bow our heads.
[2:06:13] [Music]
[2:06:17] Keep keep playing that right there,
[2:06:18] brother.
[2:06:21] Now, tonight, we've already challenged
[2:06:23] the enemy.
[2:06:24] [Music]
[2:06:27] We've challenged the enemy
[2:06:30] and exposed his whereabouts.
[2:06:34] Now, it's up to you
[2:06:37] to kick the enemy out of your house.
[2:06:41] Whatever your struggle is, whatever
[2:06:43] situation is.
[2:06:46] You have to say to it right now,
[2:06:49] you have to speak to it right now.
[2:06:53] Get it out your house.
[2:06:57] You got the power to shut the door on
[2:06:59] the devil and give God consent to be
[2:07:03] your deliverer.
[2:07:05] Will you give him consent to take up
[2:07:08] that space where the enemy has been?
[2:07:10] Will you give him consent? Don't be
[2:07:12] religious tonight. Be honest with
[2:07:14] yourself. We're not going to drag it
[2:07:16] out, but be honest with yourself. It
[2:07:19] don't take a long big prayer line for
[2:07:22] you to get what you need. All it take is
[2:07:25] you acknowledging that God is
[2:07:30] as the spirit is moving right now.
[2:07:36] Speak to that thing in your life and
[2:07:38] tell it to go.
[2:07:40] [Music]
[2:07:42] speak to it and denounce his power
[2:07:44] tonight. Whatever it may be, I don't
[2:07:47] have to know. You don't have to tell me.
[2:07:49] Tell God.
[2:07:53] Tell God. Let the spirit move tonight.
[2:07:57] Will you be free? Will you go free? Will
[2:07:59] you give God spiritual consent?
[2:08:02] Hallelujah. To restore your joy.
[2:08:07] I want you to denounce the spirit of
[2:08:11] disobedience tonight.
[2:08:13] I want you to denounce depression
[2:08:16] tonight.
[2:08:18] Sadness and loneliness.
[2:08:20] We got so much to be happy for.
[2:08:24] Don't let the enemy do that to you.
[2:08:29] And if you're fighting a sickness,
[2:08:31] it can be dealt with tonight.
[2:08:34] Before
[2:08:37] you got that sickness, God was already a
[2:08:39] healer.
[2:08:42] Will you let him be who he is? Will you
[2:08:44] give him consent tonight?
[2:08:49] God is God and there's none like him in
[2:08:53] all the earth.
[2:08:56] Lord Jesus, Father, you see your people,
[2:08:59] Lord, and you know each and every need
[2:09:01] in this place.
[2:09:03] Lord, you know the struggles of life.
[2:09:06] Lord, you know the troubles in the mind,
[2:09:09] the heart, and the body, Lord.
[2:09:11] But now we call upon you, Lord, to be
[2:09:15] all that that you are, Lord.
[2:09:18] Not only to be our savior, not only to
[2:09:21] be our healer or deliverer. Lord, we
[2:09:24] want you to have ownership.
[2:09:26] You take control of this vessel. Lord,
[2:09:28] you step aboard my boat and you grab the
[2:09:32] oars and direct me into the direction
[2:09:34] you want me to go. Can you give God that
[2:09:38] spiritual consent tonight to take
[2:09:41] control of your thoughts, to take
[2:09:43] control of your habits and all your ways
[2:09:46] and say, God, I give myself away
[2:09:49] to your will and to your purpose.
[2:09:53] Lord, only you knows.
[2:09:56] And Lord, we wouldn't say these things
[2:09:58] if these spirits wasn't present because
[2:10:01] you don't waste your time.
[2:10:06] But we bind the enemy right now in the
[2:10:08] name of Jesus Christ.
[2:10:11] In the name of Jesus Christ, we speak
[2:10:13] healing in the building.
[2:10:16] We speak deliverance in the building.
[2:10:19] Lord, all that you are, be that to your
[2:10:21] people tonight.
[2:10:25] The prophet said, "Recognize it and
[2:10:28] receive it."
[2:10:30] Recognize who he is and receive it.
[2:10:34] Receive it.
[2:10:36] Receive it tonight.
[2:10:39] Receive it tonight.
[2:10:42] Receive it in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:10:47] Here I am to worship.
[2:10:51] Here I am to bow down. Here I am to say
[2:11:00] that you're my God.
[2:11:05] You're all together love.
[2:11:10] Allto together
[2:11:12] worthy.
[2:11:15] All together
[2:11:17] wonderful
[2:11:18] [Music]

[2:11:23] God? Here I am to you lift your hands to
[2:11:27] God and say, "Here I am. Here I am to
[2:11:30] bow down. Here I am to say that you're
[2:11:38] my God.
[2:11:41] You're all to give. You're lovely.
[2:11:49] You're so worthy.
[2:11:53] You're wonderful
[2:11:56] to me.
[2:11:59] [Applause]
[2:12:00] Here I am to worship. Here I am.
[2:12:08] Bow down
[2:12:11] to say that you're my God. All together
[2:12:18] you're all together
[2:12:21] lovely.
[2:12:24] [Music]
[2:12:26] You're so worthy.
[2:12:30] You're wonderful
[2:12:33] to me.
[2:12:37] Here I am to worship.
[2:12:42] Here I am to bow. Sing it with me. Here
[2:12:47] I am to say that you're my God.
[2:12:54] [Music]
[2:12:56] All together
[2:12:58] lovey.
[2:13:00] All together
[2:13:03] worthy.
[2:13:05] All together
[2:13:09] fall to me.
[2:13:14] Here I am to worship together
[2:13:20] and to bow down.
[2:13:23] Here I am to say that you're my God.
[2:13:31] You're all together
[2:13:34] lovely.
[2:13:36] [Music]
[2:13:40] Oh Jesus. Jesus. Jesus.
[2:13:45] [Music]
[2:13:49] I give myself away.
[2:13:55] Can you lift your hand and surrender all
[2:13:57] tonight? Well, I give myself away
[2:14:03] so you
[2:14:05] can use. Oh, I give myself away,
[2:14:14] Lord Jesus.
[2:14:16] I give myself away
[2:14:21] so you
[2:14:23] could live. My life is not mine. Oh, my
[2:14:28] life is not my own.
[2:14:33] You I belong.
[2:14:38] [Music]
[2:14:40] Do you really mean it tonight? Do you
[2:14:41] really mean it?
[2:14:43] My life is not my own. My life is not
[2:14:48] [Music]
[2:14:50] to you. I belong.
[2:14:55] I give myself
[2:14:57] I give myself to you well. I give myself
[2:15:04] away
[2:15:06] all of my heart for everything that I
[2:15:08] am.
[2:15:10] Oh, I give my
[2:15:13] Lord. There is no secret places that we
[2:15:15] don't yield to you tonight. There is no
[2:15:18] place that we don't give you consent to
[2:15:20] come. Lord,
[2:15:23] there is no doors of our heart, Lord,
[2:15:24] that we wouldn't give you tonight, Lord.
[2:15:27] [Music]
[2:15:32] So you
[2:15:35] can use it when my life is not. Oh, my
[2:15:40] life is not.
[2:15:42] [Music]
[2:15:45] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:15:48] Yeah. I give myself.
[2:15:51] I give myself
[2:15:54] to you. My
[2:15:58] life
[2:16:02] you
[2:16:06] I give myself
[2:16:09] I give myself
[2:16:11] to you.
[2:16:15] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The Lord has
[2:16:18] certainly
[2:16:20] answered in a wonderful way tonight to
[2:16:22] our lives and our hearts.
[2:16:25] And uh I didn't realize
[2:16:30] until tonight how many limitations
[2:16:33] and restrictions
[2:16:35] that we put on God and we never believe.
[2:16:38] That's the conviction that I sense from
[2:16:40] the service tonight and I'll take the
[2:16:42] correction. We ourselves can put
[2:16:44] restrictions on God. It's funny about us
[2:16:47] though. We'll pray, we want something,
[2:16:49] want something greater. We want to be
[2:16:51] God to make God greater in our lives.
[2:16:54] But sometimes it's us restricting him
[2:16:56] being greater. Sometimes it's just
[2:16:58] answering the question. Just answer the
[2:17:01] question. Jesus said, "Wilt thou be made
[2:17:03] whole?"
[2:17:05] Just answer the question. Don't give
[2:17:07] excuses. Don't No, just answer it. Do
[2:17:10] you want to be well? And that's always
[2:17:11] asking, "Do you want to be healed? Do
[2:17:13] you want to be well? Do you want to be
[2:17:14] delivered? Do you want me to take
[2:17:16] control of this certain part of your
[2:17:18] heart or are you going to keep the door
[2:17:20] locked?
[2:17:21] And when brother Braden preached that, I
[2:17:23] don't think any of us knew that
[2:17:26] Revelations 3 says Christ was on the
[2:17:28] outside knocking trying to get in. He
[2:17:30] reads that text, but none of us realize
[2:17:32] when it comes to this house here, we can
[2:17:34] open the first door to the front door
[2:17:36] and we can say we want Jesus as our
[2:17:38] savior, but there's a lot of other rooms
[2:17:41] in our lives. Can you say amen? There's
[2:17:43] a lot of other doors in this house. And
[2:17:46] tonight, we can come expecting something
[2:17:48] in this church building, but when God
[2:17:50] comes on the scene, it's about where
[2:17:52] this heart is. That's what he's
[2:17:53] concerned with. Do we give him the
[2:17:56] permission and consent to be a bigger
[2:17:58] God? I tell you tonight, Lord, I want to
[2:18:00] give you full permission and full sway
[2:18:02] and full surrender to be bigger in my
[2:18:05] life than what you are now. To be the
[2:18:08] greater God. He's already greater, but I
[2:18:10] give him permission to be greater in my
[2:18:12] life. And God, if I'm putting any
[2:18:14] restrictions, if I'm trying to handle
[2:18:16] something myself, and this is an area
[2:18:18] that I'm controlling, maybe you're a
[2:18:20] control freak. No, no, no. I'm going to
[2:18:22] give it to him. I'm going to turn it
[2:18:24] over to him. I'm going to surrender it
[2:18:26] right now to him. That's what I heard
[2:18:29] from the ser. I said, the Lord's
[2:18:30] speaking to us. Is there any place in
[2:18:32] our heart that we're not given consent?
[2:18:34] I'll tell you, that's why we can't see
[2:18:36] more of God in our lives. It's not
[2:18:38] because he's not who he is. It's not
[2:18:40] because he can't do it. Not because
[2:18:42] there's not nor more freedom down the
[2:18:44] road. We can even say amen to that. But
[2:18:46] tonight, he tells us just answer the
[2:18:48] question. Do you want to be more free?
[2:18:51] Just answer the question. Do you want to
[2:18:52] be well? Just answer the question. Do
[2:18:55] you want your marriage to be better?
[2:18:57] Just answer the question. How far along
[2:18:59] do you want to be with the Lord or do
[2:19:01] you want to restrict it with your own
[2:19:02] restraints? And if we just answer the
[2:19:05] question, he's ready and willing to step
[2:19:08] in. My heart has been ministered to
[2:19:10] tonight. You almost don't want to close
[2:19:12] a service like this because you just I
[2:19:14] just see that milky feeling. The Holy
[2:19:16] Spirit is really strong here tonight in
[2:19:19] this service. You ought to say just lift
[2:19:21] your hand. Say, "Lord, I consent. I give
[2:19:23] you permission. I surrender.
[2:19:26] I surrender." Don't make it a song, but
[2:19:29] say, "I surrender.
[2:19:34] Oh, I
[2:19:38] surrender.
[2:19:42] Make it more than a song. Lord, I
[2:19:45] surrender my life.
[2:19:50] I give it all to you.
[2:19:56] Oh yes, Lord. I
[2:20:00] surrender. I don't want you to just be
[2:20:02] my savior, Lord. I want you to be Lord.
[2:20:05] I want you to be complete.
[2:20:07] Living, Lord, on the control tower,
[2:20:09] living in this house, Lord.
[2:20:12] Jesus,
[2:20:14] I surrender my life.
[2:20:19] Oh, I give it all to you.
[2:20:24] Can we sing these verses before you go
[2:20:26] tonight? Think about it now. Make it
[2:20:28] your prayer.

[2:20:38] is
[2:20:40] right.

[2:25:35] we'll give you the consent, Lord, if you
[2:25:38] if we when we do, we release
