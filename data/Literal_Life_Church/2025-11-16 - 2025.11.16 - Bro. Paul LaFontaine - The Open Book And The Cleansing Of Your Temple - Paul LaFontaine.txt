Oh, I lift my hand, bow my knee in worship at your throne. I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord, right now. Hallelujah. Amen. We recognize our dependence, total dependence on him this morning. And he is truly the great one among us. He's the one who wants to make himself known more to you. As he does that, then we know ourselves more, know our purpose, his will for our lives as he reveals more of himself. And that's what we desire him to do this morning. God bless you all in Christian fellowship. May the Lord bless the word in our time and breaking bread together today and appreciate the atmosphere that you've created and inviting our Lord to be among us and uh whatever doubts or whatever fears or whatever you've been through I believe uh there's presence of someone among us today that knows all about it &gt;&gt; and he's he's he's got the answer. It's not not that he got the has the answer. He is the answer. &gt;&gt; He is the answer. I just like to I forget to do this sometimes but I greet the people who are listening different places and some a part of our assembly some not. Um I was with a a young wonderful sister from South Korea last weekend at the youth camp and she listens in faithfully from South Korea. So I greet you sis if you're listening this morning and many others that said that they listen in sometimes and uh so we appreciate them. A couple weeks ago, we had John and Karen Edwards here from upstate New York, and they'll be coming here once a month. And uh so we greet them as well this morning. Any others who are listening, God bless you, and may uh it's not it's not like being here, but it's a second best thing, I guess. So, we pray that God will bless you and grow you in the Lord. Have some upcoming meetings next weekend, and uh we have uh brother Chris Kathy is stopping by this Wednesday. We'll have him. And then there's a couple fellowship Saturday. I'm not sure if we've already have the deadline for that, but maybe if you let Miriam know and you talk to me, I'll get you in if you're late. U but I think it's Saturday. We're meeting at 5, I believe it is there at 5:00 p.m. It's a nice time of fellowship and each of our congregation gets to invite one other couple if they want. Brother Jeremy Shriner will be with us for that and also Sunday morning. He's from Amarillo, Texas. And uh you enjoy his ministry. We had him last year at the winter youth retreat. Praise the Lord. I want to welcome brother Kyle, sister Carrie Wyart with us this morning and Josiah Koli and all their families and whoever whoever else is visiting. God bless you each one. I had some good fellowship the other day with brother Kyle around the word of God and uh he was here a couple years ago with young people and I told him I appreciated his spirit and uh so I just I've enjoyed his fellowship so much. Amen. I think that's it. So, if you wouldn't mind turning this morning in your Bibles to uh First Kings, and we're going to read together again in the story of Josiah and to go into that again, we've been speaking on that. And uh we're going to read second Kings and then we'll read in the New Testament as well. Are you happy to be in the h the Lord's house this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Certainly feel his presence. God bless you each one. I hope I didn't miss uh any of the announcements. I know Gideon made some there. Second Kings chapter, excuse me. Yeah. 2 Kings chapter 23 and we'll read a few verses and then we'll go to 2 Corinthians chapter 6. 2 Kings 23 is we read the word together. And the king Josiah sent, and they gathered unto him them all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem. And the king went up into the house of the Lord, and all the men of Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great. And he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant, which was found in the house of the Lord. I remember uh they found the book that had been lost in the temple and the temple was in a bad condition and so that they begin to read that it begin to be open to Josiah and then he was coming into action. Now he's inviting the people to come with him in reading this book so that they can maybe come to the same revival in their hearts that he's coming to by the opening of the book. You know, this is not uh this message and the opening of God's word is not just for you. &gt;&gt; I didn't get too many amens on that, but it wasn't just for you. Uh I believe it's to be passed on. And the king stood by a pillar and made a covenant before the Lord to walk after the Lord and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people stood to the covenant. And the king commanded Hikayiah the high priest and the priest of the second order and the keepers of the door to bring forth out of the temple of the Lord all the vessels that were made for Baal and for the grove and for all the host of heaven. And he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidedron, and carried the ashes of them unto Bethl. And he put down the idolatrous priest whom the kings of the Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah and the places round about Jerusalem and them also that burned incense unto Baal to the sun and to the moon and to the planets. Now, as I've been preaching, it's amazing. It's amazing that all of these idolatrous heathen gods, they weren't out there in the land somewhere. They had come so close to the temple of God. They were actually in the temple of God. &gt;&gt; That's an amazing thing how far things have gotten away. Verse six. And he brought out the grove from the house of the Lord without Jerusalem unto the brook Kiddran, and burned it at the brook kind kid kind and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people. and he break down the houses of the sodomites that were by the house of the Lord where the women wo hangings for the grove. I'm hoping this morning by the grace of God to explain some of these things from the Old Testament and what they were and also by the help of the Lord to realize that they're not too far away from the type of idols we have around us today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh don't ever think that that's just Old Testament. the the the devil's the same devil &gt;&gt; and he works the same way to cause us to worship something other than the true God. So let's go if you would to 2 Corinthians chapter 6 and let's add this in so I don't have to refer to it later. 2 Corinthians 6 and verse 14. Be ye not unequally yolked together with unbelievers. For what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? What communion hath light with darkness? And what concord hath Christ with bile? Or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? So Paul's talking about separation. And you know, we may shake hands with somebody. We may witness to somebody. We may have to be around other people who don't believe like us, but there cannot be a union with what God has given you. There cannot be a union with that. It just Paul's saying it just doesn't go together. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now he goes into the temple. And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols. &gt;&gt; Those two things should never be together. &gt;&gt; They never should work together. &gt;&gt; For ye are the temple of the living God. As God has said, I will dwell in them and walk in them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Can you say amen to that? I want it to be that way in my temple that I would walk in his precepts and he would be my God and we are his people and all of that. But you can see what Paul is saying is that idols never belong in here and you can't have this type of fellowship in your temple if there are idols there. That's right. &gt;&gt; Goes on to say, "Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, sayeth the Lord. Touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you, and will be a father unto you relationship, &gt;&gt; and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty." I want that type of relationship. &gt;&gt; But Paul's saying, the temple of God doesn't go together with idols. &gt;&gt; So, they have to be purged. and so I can come to that kind of relationship. &gt;&gt; I want to speak on the open book and the cleansing of your temple. Heavenly Father, we ask you to enrich the word this morning, Lord, by your Holy Spirit. And Father, we put it in your hands now to do the work, Lord, that the word has promised to do. And we depend on you this morning for all things, every need. And we ask it in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. Now I have been kind of itching to take a service on these particular things that were in the temple and break them down just simply so that we have an understanding that a lot of times we just read over scriptures but I want you to understand and break it down a little bit simpler. Um a few things I'd like to break down the con the condition the temple had reached at that day. uh what had been invited into the temple over time because uh those idols and the baal worship and all these things going on in the temple of God, they didn't come in there and force their way in. They had to be invited. &gt;&gt; So what had been invited into the temple over time? And why were false idols brought directly into the temple of God? I'd like to answer some of that. And and it's I I feel like saying, "How in the world did all of this get this close to the holy place of God?" The temple Jerusalem, that spot was God's place back in that day. It was the meeting place. It was the holy place. It was the place that when Solomon built that temple and everything was in order and was cleansed and and perfect, the glory of God came down in that place. It was the meeting place. It was the place that the people brought sacrifices. It was a central place for everything. How in the world over time, how in the world did these things get into the holy place of God? And then I want to go into the attention that Josiah and the people begin to give after they read the book and after the book was open to them, the attention, the the the soberness to how bad the temple was. Uh there was truly a hearing, recognizing, and acting upon the word of God. That's what brother Brandon preached. Hearing there stages hearing, but hearing is not good enough. Recognizing is the next stage, but then acting on the word of God. And Josiah and the people didn't just hear the book. They were hearing, recognizing, and they were acting on the book. And and uh because of that, they took specific actions to purge the temple. They took a they they stood up and said, "We're going to do this." This is what the word said. I don't know how they missed it before. I don't know if they become blind. I don't know what happened. Maybe I can get into that. But all I know, thanks be to God, the open book struck their heart in a revival. It put them into action and say, "We will no longer from this day forward allow God's holy place to be uh uh uh putrified, if I can say it that way, with unholy things. Something has to has to rise up." And listen now, God is the one actually that puts it on the heart to cleanse the temple. But the the people are the one that took the action. The people of God are the ones who apply the token to their home. Can I get an amen this morning? When brother Brandham preached the token, it wasn't just that we had the token in the end time. But it was not just the token. It was the application of the token. &gt;&gt; When the children of Israel had the blood, it wasn't just having the blood and lamb in their home. It was applying it to the doorpost of their home. So, we live in the hour of not just hearing the word, but applying the word, applying the token to our lives. And we're the ones that do that. We do it to our homes. We do it to our household. And the best place that we do it to is this house right here. &gt;&gt; So, so in other words, the the open book revealed the value of the temple. &gt;&gt; When the book was open to them, they got a revelation of the value of the temple. I talked to young people about this. Talked to them about it last weekend. A camp a few weeks ago. Lots of youth camps. Been invited one to in Maitius. I told you Wednesday night. So the Lord must have me still have something to say to the young people. I got invited to Maitius. I didn't even know where that was. Come to find out it's an island in the middle of the Indian Ocean. About the size of New Jersey. I'm going have to pray real hard before I go there. I don't know. But you know, when I talk to young people, I talk about the value of their vessel. And if that if you don't value your vessel as a vessel of the Lord, then you won't listen to the instructions that the word gives in order to keep your vessel pure. &gt;&gt; Says every reference I have in the New Testament about telling young people to flee youthful lust and keep their vessel and their minds pure. Every reference I have is tied to the vessel. It's tied to the temple. And he says it's good not for a man not to touch a woman. But before that, he says, "Know ye not you're a temple of the Holy Ghost." So you cannot value the guidelines the word gives you to keep your life pure until you value your vessel. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You put a high price tag, young girl, on your body and your mind and your spirit and your emotions, young guy. You value it that that this doesn't belong to the world. My mind is not a trash can for a bunch of junk. My vessel belongs to him. &gt;&gt; It's to be filled with the Holy Ghost. and nothing else. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; When we value it, and this is what happened when the book was read, they begin to value their temple and they realize, my something's going on. And because they valued their temple, it revealed uh it revealed nothing can be right or fulfilled by God if their temple is not right. Let me say that again. The revelation they got is nothing can be right. And the fulfillment of God's promise can't be right until the temple is right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What a revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing can be the way it should be until the temple is the way that it should be. Why? Because that's the central place to the purpose of God. He ordained. I'm just going to be reading a lot of things because I got a lot to get to this morning. A lot of hay on my fork. So you just uh uh as my dad used to say uh I'll read quick and you listen fast or however he said it there. So because this was the central place to the purpose of God he ordained that being the center of everything. It would be that temple and let me just move now to our day. The center of the entire revelation is c of Christ. The center of where's the center? Where's the headquarters of the entire revelation of Christ? It's not that you're in a new movement. It's not that you're in the right church. It's not that you're in the right gathering. That's not the center. It's not a certain church in this city. Uh I I can mention cities. The the the gathering and the center is not in a certain church. &gt;&gt; It's not even here. Can you say amen? The center of the revelation is in you. &gt;&gt; It's in every believer. Can you say amen? The headquarters for this message is in the spiritual Jerusalem which is the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says it this way in Christ the mystery of God reveal upon this rock. I'll build my church and the gates of hell will never shake it down, never prevail against it. I'll build my church upon this rock a revelation of Jesus Christ. Look, Christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation. See, Christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation. Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ. Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing. You see what God is trying to do. &gt;&gt; What's he doing it through? Through the message to bring you to the revelation that the headquarters, the center is not here or not in a church. It's in the believer of this hour. &gt;&gt; That's the headquarters. &gt;&gt; That's where God's everything he's doing. This whole message is summed up as he that is in you. The third Paul is summed up in he that is in you, &gt;&gt; not a church, not a movement. &gt;&gt; Oh, I should get more amens than I can't get enough amens. The center, the headquarters &gt;&gt; of this message &gt;&gt; is within every believer. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. And if that is true, then the attention of the condition of the of your temple during these times is paramount. &gt;&gt; I I just I wish I could just say that about 50 times because rather than having a good sermon, I'd rather the people here at Lift Your Life and the believers catch catch that the condition of your temple is paramount today. &gt;&gt; The question is, what's going on in your temple? That's good. &gt;&gt; What's around your temple? &gt;&gt; Because it has everything to do with how much this revelation grows. &gt;&gt; If there's something not right in your temple, it cannot be ignored. It should be quickly dealt with. &gt;&gt; If there's something wrong in your temple, it should be quickly dealt with or nothing will be right. Worship won't be right. Freedom won't be right. Life won't be right. &gt;&gt; What's going on in the temple is everything. I want to say that religion in all of its forms and all of its movements will never make your temple the center of God's work. &gt;&gt; Religion is the opposite of true Christianity. &gt;&gt; Religion in all of its forms and all of its movements, maybe even within our rank some religion to making this message out of a religion, it will you know what the distinction is? It'll never make your temple being the center of God's work. They will believe in Christ. They will go to church. Hope y'all are listening. &gt;&gt; They'll believe in Christ. They'll go to church. They will give their money. They will volunteer. They will be kind. They will put on the dress code of the group that they're in. They will believe even that God sent a prophet. They will attend some camps and meetings. You can attend all of that. You can be a part of all that and your temple be disconnected from the main central revelation. Right? &gt;&gt; Excuse me for being so straight, but it's the time that we look at these things and not separate the message &gt;&gt; from our temple. &gt;&gt; That's religion. &gt;&gt; And you take the extreme of that. You have people within Christianity and their vessels full of vile things and they're still believing that Christ &gt;&gt; is still believing in the Lord. But there's no attachment because but they're missing the the most important revelation that everything God wants to do is not in a church building. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's not you being a part of movement. &gt;&gt; It's that whatever God has, it's coming in you and coming out of you. &gt;&gt; That's the opposite of religion and Christianity. That's the difference in the two. And we must be careful not to make it that way oursel. People will believe God sent a prophet. They will attend things. But see their temple can't be disconnected. The enemy is always trying to misdirect people from this revelation. Satan fights this revelation. &gt;&gt; He said in Christ the mission, Satan howls at this revelation. &gt;&gt; And if you think that Satan stops at our doors in the message because we have a message name on the church sign, you're greatly mistaken. You're underestimating our enemy. that he gets all them to choose religion instead of the true revelation, personal revelation of Christ. Satan doesn't stop just because we have a message sign on the door. He wants to go for the people who are called to be the temples of the Lord. He's he's coming against and trying to get people that are called to be the new Jerusalem. Can you say amen? And try to get them to choose a religion. &gt;&gt; Amen. instead of the true word, &gt;&gt; instead of the true revelation of it, he's still trying to misdirect people to pride that I'm in the message or I have a superior knowledge. He's Satan's still trying to direct people that because I shouted and dance danced that I'm fine. Is Satan misdirecting people? &gt;&gt; You got a true revelation? You're welcome this morning to shout and dance all over all over this building. I'd be happy if some of you did it, &gt;&gt; but it better be because a revelation has struck your heart &gt;&gt; of your position in Christ. &gt;&gt; Cuz there is stimulation with revelation. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? I'm feeling it right now. I believe I'm hearing the true word of God and something is stirring inside my soul. Something's going on with me. Something says amen down inside. And if you're doing that, you ought to say, "Praise God, the amener is on the inside. My life might be in shambles right now. I may not have any money. I might be emotionally down. But one thing today, something down here is saying amen to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me finish that quote in Christ the Mystery. What is the new birth? Then you'd say, "Well, Brother Brandon, what is the new birth?" It's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you. Amen. See, not you joined a church, you shook a hand, you done something different, you set a creed, you promised to live by a cold of rules. &gt;&gt; That's religion. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; But Christ, the Bible, he is the word that was revealed to you. And no matter what anybody says, what takes place, it's Christ, pastor, priest, whatever it might be, it's Christ in you. That is the revelation that the church was built upon. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The amazing thing is how Israel become so disconnected with that revelation and allowed themselves to retain their Jewish name and Jehovah's name and all the while the temple became full of idols. &gt;&gt; How in the world did that happen? How can you know the commandments that say don't make any graven images, &gt;&gt; have no other gods before you? Now, these are the people that got the ten commandments. The word came to them. It wasn't the heathens. It wasn't anybody else. It was the people who received the ten commandments that said, "Don't have any graven images." It says, "Don't have any other gods before me." How in the world did the people who knew those commandments, it just shows we can become blind and hearing the very word Yes. &gt;&gt; And slowly slowly let our temple &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; become used for other things. &gt;&gt; So they had a huge connect. Had they forgotten that even their father Abraham came from a family of idol worshippers? Did they forget that that's the very thing their father Abraham that started this whole group of the Jews and the circumcised and all that? Did they forget that Abraham one day was in a home with, if you look it up, full of idol worshippers, full of idols even in their homes, set up all over the place. And God come and spoke to him, says, "I want you to get away from all that. I wanted you to get away from your family. Get away from your kindred. I've got another land for you and and get away from your father's house." He needed to make a separation &gt;&gt; from the idolatry in order to come to the full promise of God. I'll bring you to a new land. I'll multiply your people. See, part of it was a geographical promise. I'm going to give you a geographical piece of land, and it's yours. But the deeper part of the promise is that you'll become a nation. And his wife was barren. &gt;&gt; I want you to notice the second part of the promise wasn't literal or a geographical piece of land. The first one was a spiritual seed that would come from him, natural and spiritual that would go over the whole earth as the sands of the sea. He first he said the angel said, I just love this. He said it'll be like the your seed, his wife's barren, your seed will be like like the sands. And later he says, no, it won't be like the dust. It'll be like the stars above. You won't be able to number what's going to come out of where? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come out of you. &gt;&gt; Well, there's the revelation &gt;&gt; right there with our father Abraham is that second part of the promise. He wasn't going to go somewhere and find that. That promise was going to come out of his own loins. &gt;&gt; He won't go find it in a temple or a church. He would be the temple. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The promise is going to come through him. &gt;&gt; He would be the center of it all. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And he wouldn't get to it unless he separated from an idolatrous family and all that will come out with him. It was not an earthly temple. It came out of the revelation God gave him. And in Josiah's time, God's grace came through this young king. And he had a revival, a personal revival in his heart that come from when the book was read to him. He had already started to repair the temple. Got a revelation. This temple's a mess. I'm going to start repair it. When they were repairing it, they found I'm just catching people up here. If you haven't listened, while he he gets in his heart, this temple is a mess. We're going to It's kind of like I think of people who recognize things that need to be done around this big building and the yard and everything. And God just puts in their heart that this needs to be done and they go do it. as Josiah says, "This temple needs to be repaired this, you know, let's see." And so he just begins doing that. And while they were doing it, they found the book with dust on it. And &gt;&gt; that's how far they had gotten away from God. &gt;&gt; Book was everything. &gt;&gt; The book of redemption is everything. &gt;&gt; That's why our lamb had to take the seals off it in the last days &gt;&gt; because it's a book of our identity. The book is everything. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so Josiah, God's grace came through him and he his revival spilled over to everyone else. Reminds me of what brother Brandham says. You sit around and wait for the church to have a revival. He says, "Don't do that." He said, "Let it start in you and it'll break out other places." And so he got a personal revival by the book being open and read to him. And it spilled over into everyone else. And he had that book read to the whole congregation. It connected them with the revelation. Nothing goes any further if you don't have a value of the temple. And they got a revelation. The first action we need to do is to cleanse our temple and separate idols from our beloved temple. &gt;&gt; And notice to this people, it is not good enough just that the book was opened and being read. The book being right and the temple being wrong is not what we're looking for. Amen. &gt;&gt; The book being right and open to us and the temple being wrong is not what we're looking for as a congregation &gt;&gt; and as people. &gt;&gt; In fact, I'd say maybe that's why we're not finished with all this yet. &gt;&gt; Why isn't the rapture yet? &gt;&gt; Why are we gone yet? Could it be because our temple is after all these years and the message and the conventions we've been to and all the preaching and the open book and all of it? Could it be that this isn't wrapped up because our temples are still filled with other things? &gt;&gt; Still got some bitterness in your heart? &gt;&gt; Still dabbling privately in some worldliness. Pride, the need to be popular. That one's for the preachers more than anybody else. Complexes from the past &gt;&gt; still binding you in your temple. We can't ignore that in our vessel. Those things in our vessel and celebrate the open book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Doesn't work that way. Didn't work that way in Josiah's day. didn't work that way today. Don't work that way today. But I believe there's a people rising that they're saying it's not good enough that I just in a message church hearing about the open book. &gt;&gt; I said there's an army rising. There's a there's let the worshippers arise. Let the true worshippers arise this morning. There's a people rising and saying it's not good enough that I can celebrate the book being open. I want that book to be revealed in my life in this temple. Whatever he said is going to happen in me, I want it to be revealed in me. It's not good enough that the book is right and my temple's not right. It's not good enough that the book is right, but my mind is constantly bound for 20 years. That's not good enough. I want a freedom in my temple. I want to worship freely in my temple. There's a people rise and saying because good enough for some of you, and I'll tell you, I hate to say it. I've been a pastor long enough. Some of you, I'm going to be straight with you. You'll hear a sermon like this and go right back to your habits. But I'm praying that God would deal with you because this isn't about coming to church. It's where is your vessel every day with the Lord? What are you feeding on? What are you looking at? What kind of books are you reading? &gt;&gt; And some will go back right to their habits because it's such a habit to them. But I'm praying in my own life first because the minister has to be first partaker of the fruit. God, where in my private life, where in my temple is there anything &gt;&gt; that shouldn't be allowed? &gt;&gt; Purge it, Lord, from me. &gt;&gt; I'm so interested in a revival breaking in my heart and &gt;&gt; breaking out other places that there's a people rising because and saying, "Take me deeper." &gt;&gt; How many are with me? &gt;&gt; Take me deeper, Lord. Take me deeper than that. Cuz religion isn't working anymore. &gt;&gt; Religion isn't working anymore. Every single Sunday, just like the one before, &gt;&gt; religion isn't working anymore. &gt;&gt; I want to know my precious Jesus. &gt;&gt; And I want to love him like I've never loved him before. I want to know the power and the resurrection power cuz religion isn't working anymore. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, &gt;&gt; take this house of God. Take this temple, Lord. &gt;&gt; Let it all be yours. That's why that's why re religion likes the Christmas holiday. Might as well get ready for Christmas coming up, right? &gt;&gt; Religion likes Christmas, you know. And I just I have this thing when they start start decorating, you know, like a month before Thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; I have a pet peeve about that. So my kids, you get that back in the barn. Get back because you're doing what the rest of the world. You're over you're overriding the only American Christian holiday is not Christmas. It's Thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; Now I'm becoming very few and far between that still believe that. I I was coming back from Newark. Got home by the grace of God with all the cancellations. And I get out I'm happy to be home walking through the airport. I said, "Am I 3 weeks before Thanksgiving?" Not Christmas. Am I hearing Christmas song coming across in this airport right now? &gt;&gt; Am I really Is this really happening? And the righteous anger of God rose up in me. &gt;&gt; Is this really happen? If I hear that song, last Christmas I gave him my heart. The very next day, he threw it away. Hey, I don't know what he did with it, but if I hear that song one more time, I'm going to pound my head against the wall and Santa baby as well. But the world doesn't know what Christmas is. &gt;&gt; And Christianity has made it's symbolism over substance. &gt;&gt; There's no substance what what Christmas is. It's the symbolism of it. And religion is emphasizing the symbolism of the resurrection, the cross, the symbolism, but no substance. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be that way. I want the substance of what Calvary produced. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So hopefully, you know, we'll get over this. And it's it's incredible &gt;&gt; uh how quickly. But I I I pulled up this scripture last night. It's Malachi 3:1. If you guys want to pull it up, um, here's a Christmas scripture. And all of them know all the scriptures. They read them, but there's no power of the Christmas one. Look at this one. Behold, I will Here's a Christmas scripture for you. Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me. That's John the Baptist. And the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his temple. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a Christmas scripture. Yeah, that's the best one because what happened in Christ is the Lord was coming to his new temple. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't going to be Solomon's temple. It wasn't going to be the tabernacle anymore. He's revealing his revelation. The Lord will come to the true temple that he wanted to come to. He'll pour himself, 100% of himself in that little baby. Can you say amen? and he'll start the revelation that the Lord will come to his temple. On the day of Pentecost, the Lord was coming to his temple. At the end time, the Lord is coming to his temples. That's Christmas. &gt;&gt; That's Christmas. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, now let's go into some uh specifics here. Now over a 300year period then they become so disconnected the idols of Baal and groves come into the temple and outside groves everywhere around the temple. Things that were usually in the heathen lands were out there. You had to go many many miles to get into the uh the Canaanite land or somewhere where you found all this stuff. But now after 300 years it's it's right housed. They built houses. They built groves all around the temple and then somehow they got invited in the temple. So that's the condition. Little groves are little places of trees to gather around and speak and worship the god. So the grove could be the statue, but then the grove could be a surrounding of trees around the statue that you could come in privately and worship that grove and that statue that that began to be built all around. And they said here that they took a grove out of the temple as well. I don't know what it was. We don't know. But we know what groves are. We know what the statues are. And then of course I mentioned to you that there were houses of sodomites and prostitution, male prostitution that had built taken over houses and built houses right around the temple. Anything built by or idols in the place of God's holy place is an abomination. How many knows that Jesus quoted Daniel says when the abomination of desolation he referred to it and an abomination of desolation is something else was allowed in the holy place to be built in the holy place and it became empty of God's presence. So abomination is that there's something else in the holy place of God. The desolation is it becomes empty of God's presence because the desolation is there. Excuse me the abomination is there. So now the abomination of desolation began of course when Titus came in took the temple in that day and Jesus prophesied of that until this day till this day is still the abomination of desolation. &gt;&gt; But I just want to remind the devil that there's a promise for the Jews. They're going to take back over that holy place and the temple's going to be built back again. That ought to be an encouragement to you this morning. No matter what the condition of your temple, no matter what you've done, no matter how bad you've messed up, God can restore your temple to be a temple of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You got to start getting broken before the Lord and say, "Take me, Lord, as I am, and he'll take you." Start to rebuild the temple. So, you are the temple of the Lord. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; The bride is the new Jerusalem spiritually. You should recognize that that promise and take it back completely for the Lord. So they headed in there and they took out all the vessels of Baal and all the groves, took them out, beat them, and crushed them to powder. I just want to make a note. They This was serious business. They didn't just want to kick them out and they're laying over in the grass. They crushed these idols of Baal to powder. &gt;&gt; How serious should we be to crush the idols and images out of our lives? &gt;&gt; Crush them to powder. You talk about a revelation. &gt;&gt; I don't ever want to see that thing again. &gt;&gt; Crushed it to powder, sprinkled the ashes over, &gt;&gt; took some of them into uh Bethl, which is the worst uh place supposed to be the house of God. Bethl is supposed to be and it became the worst heathenistic worship in Bethl. So, they took all the ashes over there. So, now Baal, I don't have to tell uh many of you this. You know this from the history of the prophet's message and also maybe you study but for the ones who haven't Baal means lord or ruler and of all the gods that came as an influence to Israel of all the gods Baal was the biggest rival to Yahweh Baal worship became the biggest it's even mentioned over in the in the book of revelation so Baal was the biggest rival so we should look at that and realize that the biggest influence of Israel came from the god Baal goes way back origins 5,000 years ago or maybe more. We don't know. The prophet breaks it down in the church age book says Nimrod's wife deified him after her husband died. Nimrod's wife deified him after he died. She deified herself, too. That's what she did. Uh yeah, it be it's interesting to make a note that after someone dies, they deify him. That's the spirit of Satan. &gt;&gt; You take a prophet after he dies, people deify him. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's the spirit of Satan to do that. &gt;&gt; But she did it and she deified herself to and she made herself not only the wife of Nimrod but the mother of Nimrod and then made him the son god. Brother Bram brings it out. The son god become known as the god of storms, the god of fertility. So you have the the woman is attached to fertility of course and also god blessing and prospering the lands. And so he was the god of storms. So he had power in that area over nature and then he had power to sway men and do what he needs to for men through that uh god of fertility. And they begin to cry out to that bless our crops. But also it was related to a woman a woman's body and that became a god. A woman a woman's body was part of the statues and that became a god to the people. That was never meant to be for that to happen. One true Jehovah God that they didn't have an image of necessarily. He didn't want images of that. But they put images and this is what it was a power over nature in turn to bring us power over I'm just saying these way because this is the way I interpret it. When they begin to worship that it's dealing with something in men wanting to worship a god that had power over nature another god that had power of nature that would in turn m make us think that we had power over nature. We don't have power over nature ourselves. Right? &gt;&gt; Nature controls us. So now this God became nature controlling us and women controlling us. Maybe because she birthed us. And then brother Bram takes it now all the way to Satan coming into the Christian church, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And bringing that whole worshiping of mother, &gt;&gt; the mother of Jesus and the son, son God, which became su became sached it together and now we have Christmas. We have all this stuff that come, but it originated, you know, some 5,000 years ago. &gt;&gt; The whole precept is deception, and Satan brings it into the Christian church. &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to summarize. Satan was wanting to misdirect things away from God. And that's why he did the mother and son. Even a dual or multiple God worship was against the ten commandments. Here, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord. And whatever you split it into two or three or 500, you're talking the opposite of Christianity because Christianity and actually the true Jews, it's one God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't that simplify things a little bit. I I always look at it that way. You know, Brother Kyle was just like that's it's one Lord, one faith, one baptism. When we start to get into multiple choices here, uh it's like Leo Deia, &gt;&gt; but it's simple. There's only one Lord. There's only one faith. There's only one baptism. &gt;&gt; There's not 335 different denominations in their take on God. There's only one true faith. There's only one true Lord. &gt;&gt; So this emphasis on mo mother and woman and son. So it's possible this is what they look like when they come out of the temple. And we don't know, but this is some of the archaeological findings they bring up. The first one is a statue. This probably was in the temple and the artistic depictions of this. So this was Baal. This is one of the things. Other other ones were just a head with horns coming out. But you notice you got horns coming out of them. He's holding a tree. Trees are always associated with all of this. We had the trees in the garden and that become the emphasis. The trees become the the tree of knowledge, good and evil is a person. The tree of life was a person, but it was there in a garden. Okay. So here he's holding a tree. So trees are associated in the groves. Trees were around as around the groves. And then he's holding something, but he's got this, and this is the way it explains um number one, the the artist depictions um is usually a bullheaded figure. Okay, you didn't get that one. He's got horns coming out, so he's bullheaded. Maybe that's why there was such an attraction from some people, because they're a bit bullheaded. Okay. Bale is often shown as a man with the head and horns of a bull, a thunderbolt wielding deity. He is frequently depicting holding a thunderbolt symbolizing his power over storms, power over fertility, power over destruction, and your own power over nature o over life. That's the deception I think that's in it. There's a God that that has power over nature besides the true God has power over life, all these other things. And then man begins to take that because remember he told Eve you shall become as gods yourself. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So the deception is that now these things that this God has you can take. You have power over nature yourself. Look at look at the deception because sons and daughters of God under Christ in their heart can have power over nature to &gt;&gt; speak to the storm. &gt;&gt; But here's another god saying no you get power here over nature over life and uh you know abortion comes in there different things. So they're worshiping a god that can bring us prosperity, fertile lands, fertility through a a woman. So you see you you have uh so here's let let me just look at the other two statues here. The one here you have this is another one that they found. So this is Baal. This might have been what come out of the temple as well. He's got the horn. He's got something in his hand there. That's what it looked like. But then there was this other one that was actually related to Baal. And she looks he it's it looks like more of the feminine side because in this god was the masculine side, the feminine side as well, &gt;&gt; god of fertility and and mother and things. And so that's that's what uh the feminine side looks like there. She kind of she's got her sunglasses on. She kind of looks cool there. I don't know how many thousands years of old she is, but that was just it it just reminds me of some things Brother Bram said about the male. There's not much attraction, but then Satan makes the woman attractive. &gt;&gt; Brother Paul, I don't know how you find that attractive probably, but nevertheless, it's it's a little bit different than the male. &gt;&gt; You have one here. It's almost a crossover to a female form. When this happens, it's the spirit of trans, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Crossover. &gt;&gt; You can be either. You can choose to be either, &gt;&gt; right? We're going to say these gods are still alive today. &gt;&gt; These demons are still alive today. &gt;&gt; When this happens, it's it's a spirit. So images and grows. And I can show you more images. I can show you the full images, but I can't show them because in this open audience because they're they're not appropriate to show because most of the female images is a a statue of a woman's naked body. and and and that God is called Asher, not just Baal, but Asher, the counterpart of Baal. And she's usually naked or she's emphasizing parts of her body. Now, listen friends, this message isn't to point back to, you know, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000 years ago. &gt;&gt; If that's the God, and Brother Bam says, now we have a woman's body becoming the goddess of this generation. &gt;&gt; It's what the in the days of Noah, sons of God fell by &gt;&gt; the beauty of women. Those images, you don't have to go see us. Those images are put in front of us all the time. &gt;&gt; The cross is because this is both the power of a woman and the worship of a woman and the worship of a powerful man. Power that is without God, of course. So, I'm getting past some of these points. I want you to think about them. Groves were trees as well, not just statues. grows through trees. That God uh that God there is holding a branch of a tree. Trees are tied to heathen worship. Trees are tied to her heathen worship. I'll just leave that with you. So this idol worship appealed to man's flesh and his fallen nature. Something drew him to it. It was more appealing to Jehovah worship. Why was it more appealing? Why was it more appealing than Jehovah worship? because it was sensual and it appealed to the flesh of man, &gt;&gt; not his soul. &gt;&gt; How many things do we have today in front of us available to us that are to satisfy the sensual flesh? &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; And so then you know you if you move into that, you're staying home and watching your shows and reading your books instead of coming to church. They weren't ignorant to this going on. They were ignorant to this going on and how it appealed to them because these idols could not speak. 1 Corinthians 12 verse one. Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. So just Paul says this several times. We as believers are not to be ignorant. &gt;&gt; The Gentiles, other Gentiles are ignorant. They don't know what all these gods mean. They don't know how the devil uses them. But we are not to called to be ignorant. In one place Paul says we are not ignorant of Satan's devices. And if you are, you're like other Gentiles. You choose to be ignorant. But we're not to be an ignorant people. We're to use our discernment to say, "Wait a minute. This is this is what this is. I researched it. I did my homework. This is where this comes from." There's some sisters that won't even young girls that won't even look where something comes from. They'll just start wearing something. I think you ought to go research where it comes from. &gt;&gt; That's right. research the source of it. &gt;&gt; That shows you're interested. I don't want to just start wearing something just because it was in a magazine or just because it's popular. Check out where it comes from. And those your guys clothes as well. Oh boy, this isn't in my notes, but you guys ought to research where little styles come from sometimes. &gt;&gt; And haircuts come from &gt;&gt; if you're not going to take the time to do it, then you're choosing to be uh ignorant. And we're not called to be ignorant. This is what Paul does deals with the spiritual gifts. The idols appealed to the flesh instead of the soul. They were dumb idols. And that means they didn't speak. You know, if they're in front of a thing that didn't speak, aren't you glad to have a God that speaks today? &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; He's speaking to us right now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They had no clue as to the portals that opened up to the demonic realm. So, they were dumb. The the the idol was dumb. Couldn't speak. And the people following the idol were dumb because they were dumb to the portals that it opened up to demons because it wasn't just this statue in the temple sitting there. If they begin to worship that, it opened a portal, a channel for all the demon power to come into that temple. &gt;&gt; And they were dumb of this. They didn't have the discernment to know this. It's still true today. Everything has a spirit with it. Music has a spirit with it. The right or wrong spirit. Movies have a spirit with it. The right or wrong spirit. &gt;&gt; Books have a spirit that carry with them. The right spirit or the wrong spirit. And the quicker we grow up and get discernment about ourselves and discern not just, oh, I'm enjoying this. This is good. It makes me laugh. No, no, no, no. What spirit is behind it? Because if I feed on it long enough, I'm going to take that spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. You know that ye were Gentiles carried away with these dumb idols even as ye were led. They were led away by dumb idols that couldn't speak. They were dumb because they couldn't speak. But Paul's really saying you were led away. So they were dumb and you were dumb. That's the Lefontaine Standard Revised Version right there. You were led away by it by dumb idols and you were dumb to be led away by it. &gt;&gt; And we're not as other Gentiles. We're not called to be like all the rest of the world. We're not called to feed on the things like the rest of the world. I don't care what condition you are this morning. Repent before the Lord. Repent. Claim the blood of Calvary and say, "Lord, cleanse my temple and grab a hold of that promise. I'm not like the other girls. I'm not like the other guys. My mind is not meant to be trashed like this." &gt;&gt; We're not like other Gentiles. We're called to be sons and daughters of God. Say, "I'm only 12 years old." You're called to be a son of God. Stand with the blood of Jesus Christ. They were ignorant. They were led away by fleshly love, lot a fleshly appeal. God does not want his people ignorant, the bride will get advantage. How many can say, praise the Lord, the bride will get the advantage over Satan in the end time. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm speaking promise. This bride, he won't get the advantage over her because she's not dumb. She's got discernment. She won't be deceived. Is what the Bible says. Can you say amen? The bride will get the advantage over Satan in the end time because the book has been open to her by revelation. She is no longer ignorant of Satan's devices. How will she become a brother says we'll become powerhouses for the kingdom of God. How does she going to become a powerhouse for the spirit of God? Because she knows what can affect her temple. She's all over it. She knows she discerns the spirit behind something. &gt;&gt; We're not like other Gentiles. It's amazing today after all the statistics and all the results of something or is people choose to still dabble in things that affect them. Christians do video games. I've preached for years uh against video games and being obsessed with that. And then now all the results are in and now all the shootings are in. It's interesting that the news they'll mention something about this boy who killed Charlie Kirk and all the other shootings. 95% of them their life is spent behind that those video games shooting and killing until they become numb to shoot somebody themselves. And the the news will just mention it, but that's all. But I'm telling you, they don't understand the portals that you open yourself up to with those video. And I'm going to continue until I die to preach against that stuff. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not whether mom and dad told you and wouldn't didn't, you know, mom and dad didn't allow me to have it, so now I'm going to have it myself. &gt;&gt; How childish. &gt;&gt; You need to look at what's what it's influencing your life to do. I've watched men not even get up and go to work and support their families because they're so addicted. And I've told some of you, you get rid of that in your life. Get rid of that. Get rid of that. Things will be different in your life. You're not going to do it. You're going to hang on to it. It's your comfort blanket. &gt;&gt; But it opens up channels of demons. &gt;&gt; But it don't affect me. &gt;&gt; Must have been the same thing Israel said for 300 years. it don't affect me, &gt;&gt; but it did back then &gt;&gt; and it does today. &gt;&gt; So, that was what's on the inside of the temple. But then right close around the temple, there's these statues as well on these areas of trees. And I'm moving along as quickly as I can. Statues around the temple of God, houses of male prostitution, houses of sodomites. And I said at the beginning of the series, how in the world do you have a whole house of Sodom and Gomorra and Sodommites planted right next to the temple? They were supposed to be in Sodom. &gt;&gt; And isn't that like the Sodom spirit? It's not good enough to stay amongst their own community. They want to change the laws. They want your children. They want to knock on the door of Lot's house. &gt;&gt; That's the spirit behind it. It's not good enough to stay in their community. They want to come in here, &gt;&gt; take one of our teenage girls or teenage boys and influence them with the spirit of sodom sodomites. &gt;&gt; So they were they were begin to build houses around Israel didn't catch didn't catch it. And so groves, the groves where they could they could have certain they could have curtains or I want you to catch this now. They could have curtains or tent-like coverings. When it when it says there in the scripture, it says something about and the women around the houses of sodomites and around the groves, they had they had coverings. So they had tent-like coverings used to create shrines or private places for the cultic sexual rituals associated with the worship of the goddess and male cult prostitutes often mentioned in the verse. In essence, the women were participating in a form of idol idolatrous worship that involved weaving items for a false deity within the very precincts of the Lord's temple. Now, this first picture I want to show you is the heathens when they were in their own land. This is how they had it. They were in the open. There's not coverings or things that make it private. They were out there. So, this would have been in the heathen lands wherever that was. This is how they did it. So, they had this. It was a cultish uh worship. It was related to sexual, how should I say it, just male prostitution. All the it was very sensual and sexual related. This is how it would have looked with their gods right out front and there. in this this whole party, but it's open. When they begin to build houses around the temple, then the groves came in of covering it. And as it just said, I want to read it the way he said it. The the the the the women had tent-like coverings used to create shrines or private places to cover up what was going to happen in there. He didn't do that when it was back in the heathen land. But when he got it around the temple for the Israelites to participate in, he made private places for them to do it. &gt;&gt; This is what it would like to look like in the temple. All not only inside the temple, but around the temple. That doesn't that's this. I'm just showing you around the temple. There would have been houses. There would have been groves. There would have been all kinds of places built completely surrounding the temple over 300 years now. This is the temple of God. They're not in their heathen lands anymore, but they're building these houses of sodomites, these groves around all these trees and building private places for the people of God that are called to be the people of God to get in their own private place to worship that other God. Most of the things that has been developed by Satan today for us to fall has been made strategically that you can do it privately &gt;&gt; in a movie theater. You're with a lot of other people but not today. Right. &gt;&gt; So now when they come to doing the groves around the temple, this is what they would have looked like a little bit more something like this where with something around it. Could have been tapestries, could have been a brush, whatever it is. This actually is from 400 years ago. This is brother uh Tony a a grove in Nigeria, believe it or not. A very popular grove there. It's still there. And so I'm only taking that because they didn't change too much in their pattern through the hundreds of years of idol worship. When there was a grove, it became a a private place like this that they go secretly in there. And sometimes they were even smaller, just a small. So that lets you know what it maybe would have looked like around the temple, more private. And then the houses would have looked like this. I got to move along here because my time the houses, this is a standard possible home of the Israelites around the temple of God. So now they would have either built the sodomites would have built houses like this or they would have uh rented the houses like this. Satan, he'll take a rental if it's close to the temple of the Lord. He'll he'll sign a lease &gt;&gt; for a short time &gt;&gt; till you kick him out. &gt;&gt; He'll take what he can get. &gt;&gt; This kind of what it looked like. But they made them houses of sodomites, houses of prostitutes. And friends, they're not in Sodom. They're around the temple of God. &gt;&gt; Close to the temple of God. So then if you take all these things together, here's the temple of the Lord. All of these things were not out somewhere. They were either in or around the holy place of God. &gt;&gt; Meant to be where the glory of God would come down. Is anybody getting this this morning? &gt;&gt; Is anybody tying it together? We can talk all day. Let's And this is what needs to happen. This is what needs to happen next. We need to go forth and purge our lives so that &gt;&gt; then we got a temple that's clean and dedicated only to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I can't do that for you. I can only preach it to you. You can only do it for yourself. &gt;&gt; We can talk all day about back then, but how relevant is the things I'm saying to today? I listened to yesterday to Christianity versus idolatry. There's only two things, Christianity, true Christianity and idolatry. And it was amazing to watch the prophet and he just says we think idolatry is in Africa over he says our country is full of idolatry full of it &gt;&gt; because we have access see it's about the images that's placed in front of us. &gt;&gt; A statue is an image but today images can be flashed in front of us constantly. &gt;&gt; So we still have the wrong things flashing in front of us and that's still idolatry. So, you know, and so many things he said in that, I encourage you to listen to it, uh, because it's there's it's incredible how he's taken not only the world's the African idolatry, and he's seen all that, but he's taken denominations, the systems, not the people, the systems have become an idol because he what are you? I'm a Baptist. I'm a Presbyterian. &gt;&gt; It becomes an idol to them instead of true Christianity. &gt;&gt; That's right. Then he then he brings in the Pentecostals. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm listen I'm going he's rebuking and he's saying that Pentecost has gone into a bit of idolatry like this. He said when you it's my church so I can say this. He said he said the idolatries he says just kind of lose yourself and get you go into a trance or something when they're worshiping these gods. And then he brings up the Pentecostals and he said, you know, that's what they're encouraging them to do. Just start speaking in tongues or start doing something. Just kind of lose yourself. &gt;&gt; He's attaching it to it. These Pentecostal traditions, it's crossing over an idolatry and yet it seems like the real thing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the one who's saying it. He's seeing that. He's sitting down. He's study. He said, "I've taken two weeks to study idolatry." And he studied it. He brings this message Christianity versus idolatry. He brings denominations. He brings in the Pentecostals using some of the same things. Just lose yourself and things like that. And then he says he tried to rebuke a lady who ended up speaking in tongues while he was preaching and told her to sit down. &gt;&gt; I'm not done preaching. Sit down. And she kept want interrupting. He said sit down till I'm done. &gt;&gt; They came up to him afterwards and says you grieve the spirit of God when you did that. &gt;&gt; He said any spirit that would interrupt the word being preached should have been grieved. And this guy said, he said, "But she had something fresh from the Lord." &gt;&gt; And brother Bren says, "Wow, ain't that back to that old idolatry again? &gt;&gt; I have something fresh is other than that Bible. &gt;&gt; You're talking idolatry." And when we have an emphasis of people coming forward always wanting a fresh word from the Lord, &gt;&gt; I would be careful of that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because a man be may be led to say something to you, but when you're depending and you're not tied to that Bible and you're wanting something fresh from the Lord and that's the craving, &gt;&gt; something wrong with that picture. &gt;&gt; You get back over here. I want to ask this question though. How close has the images come to our temple in 2025? &gt;&gt; Now I'm not talking about books so much even though they can be have the wrong spirit. I'm talking about images because that's what the idols were. It was an image in front of you. How close have images come to our temple? How many images are put in front of us out there every day? &gt;&gt; A lot. But they are closer than they've ever been. Hollywood invaded our shores. According to brother Brandham, we had an invasion of the United States. They invaded the West Coast. And how was our shores invaded? Not by an army from another country, by Hollywood. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Our country was invaded by the Army of Hollywood. &gt;&gt; So maybe we lived in Pittsburgh or maybe we lived in Detroit or maybe we lived all over the country. But but Hollywood brought began to develop its images and so it was getting closer to us. &gt;&gt; Hollywood invaded our shore 1910. Not long after that, not very long after they had bioscopes in theaters. Louisiana was the first one. So when they come into theaters now, Hollywood, what it's producing can be closer. It moves closer to the individual. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's the early 1900s. The first TV in a home was 1928. Just want to say he moved it closer. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; First computer in a home. PC personal computer. &gt;&gt; This is my computer. This is personal. Even these names. Do I have that symbol of apple on the back of my Yeah, there it is. It's an apple with a bite out of it. Most preachers have it, so I'm not bad this morning. How close is it? First computer in the home PC 1975 came closer. First time the worldwide web was available was 1991. And with the worldwide web, everything comes closer. It's called the information highway. That means we have access to all information around the world and it's come into our personal computer. Access to everything eventually access to everything including the most vile things. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In our eyes, images before eyes. The first cell phone with a screen was 1994. Did it come closer with the cell phone? Come closer to us. &gt;&gt; The images came closer. Then quickly in 1996, the cell phone got the cell phone got full access to the worldwide web came closer to us. &gt;&gt; Next year 1997, the first social media platform came into play, which means it came everything came closer to us. Who's leading this? &gt;&gt; Who's leading this? &gt;&gt; But technology, it's more than technology. &gt;&gt; It's moving it closer &gt;&gt; to the believer's temple. &gt;&gt; I wonder if Satan said, "Huh, so the Bible says, you know, he reads the Bible, too. &gt;&gt; Huh? The Bible says that these guys are the temples of God." Huh? The last prophecy in the Bible in Revelations 21, I think it is, Satan says, I think it is, is that the new Jerusalem comes down like a bride adorned for her husband. Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men. The final prophecy is God has tabernacled himself where in a people. &gt;&gt; She's the new spiritual Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; And Satan reads it and he's saying, "Okay." And he's saying, "I've got to bring the demons so close to them. guys. Talking to all his guys, his demons. I want you to put every image that we've got available as close to their temple as you can put it. &gt;&gt; So, he begins this prophecy. If that's the prophecy, we got the power. We're going to fight against that prophecy. If they're the temples, then it doesn't matter if it's in Hollywood. You've got to bring Hollywood close to their temples. If they've got a mind like they've got, like the rest of the Gentiles, we've got to bring those images so they see those images more often. &gt;&gt; So guys, I want you to work on it. I want you to bring these images. I want you to take everything in all the coffers. Bring it out. And I want you to throw these images just as close and in front of their faces and their eyes as you can do them. I believe there's not a way any human being can escape if you place that right in their hand. and place that right in front of them. I don't think he any human being can escape that. &gt;&gt; Well, he's greatly mistaken. &gt;&gt; Put everything in front of their eyes. Make it so they never have to go get something bad. Make it private. They can look privately in that way. Make it so it's user friendly to defile and mess with their mind, to depress them, to put condemnation on them. Do everything you can. We have ruined. We've already guys, we've already ruined their attention spans. &gt;&gt; The whole culture has ADD. &gt;&gt; It's a new name that Satan come up with and threw at them. You guys are ADD. You have attention deficit disorder. That's why some of you can't sit an hour, hour and a half while I preach. &gt;&gt; But you can watch a three-hour movie. &gt;&gt; Preacher is being rough today. I'm going to tell it like it is. There's an imbalance in our lives. If we can't sit and hear the word of God, there's an imbalance in our lives. &gt;&gt; We don't care enough for our temple. What goes in these minds? &gt;&gt; I'd rather sit for hours and hear the word of God and get those seeds in my mind and my heart than anything else in this life. Cuz I know that's the only thing that's going to get me in a rapture someday. &gt;&gt; Only thing that gets me out of here. Your movies won't get you out of here. Your books, your romance novels won't get you out of here. That's right. &gt;&gt; This word by revelation is going to get us out of here. Somebody ought to say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Make it so user friendly to defy and mess with. They have ADD. They can't even focus for an hour sermon. So make Now make clips because they have ADD. Make clips 10 seconds, no longer than 10 seconds, and flash those images and idols as quick as you can because we know demons that their mind still catches it even if it flashes for a second. &gt;&gt; See, Satan knows that in his demons, &gt;&gt; but a lot of Christians don't know that. &gt;&gt; How close? How close he makes How how close how close did he bring it? It's right here in my pocket. You might put it in your back pocket. If I do that, I can't find it. But I have it in this pocket. Sorry, deacons. We're having my phone in church. But I want to illustrate this how close he brought everything. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm holding I'm holding. Don't think at the end of the service I'm going to tell you to throw these away. Even though I'd like to, &gt;&gt; but but it's amazing how it's been all planned out that we can't really throw them away. &gt;&gt; We could distance oursel from them a little bit more &gt;&gt; because we are addicted to them. &gt;&gt; But look how close. Now it's not a PC. Now it's not this. I appreciate this. Uh what is this? An iPad. Saves a lot of paper. I'm doing my part, you know. global warming, whatever. I'm doing my part. &gt;&gt; But it comes from all this and it's this close to us. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; And it's in our hand and it's, you know, most of the time in restaurants and everywhere, this is where you see there's no communication. &gt;&gt; And it's and and he's got it right. Every image, every image that you could find in this world is right here, &gt;&gt; put right in front of us. That's serious. &gt;&gt; It's serious when our temples are to be temples of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; So then it then in my phone it makes an app for everything. And you know there's an app for everything. That's what they say. So we got access to all these things. I've got you know I've got my Bible app which I love. I've got the table app. If you don't have that one you should get it. I love it. I can listen to something. I've got the new Fountain House app. Anybody know about that? Every song that's ever been recorded here. Over 500 songs. The Fountainhouse app. I'm doing a commercial right now. I can hit that app and have music all the time going in my life. I love it. You should get it. You know, I got some of these other things that I probably don't even need. You know, they have all the apps. Some of it is good, but a lot of it, if not most of it, needs to be through the filter of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; The new apps coming out or you can have a friend on here. If you don't have a friend, you can have a friend. &gt;&gt; That's the newest thing coming out. the newest there's a new one that's coming out or it's out and uh I forget what it's called but it helps you to focus to get stuff done during the day. Boy, I I might need that but it it's actually a friend who reminds you and helps you focus and I you know so a lot of this stuff is good. I like you know I like to speak into it instead of having to type on a really small screen. I'm telling the stuff I like. And so I I talk to people and sometimes those texts don't come out right. I've had to apologize. &gt;&gt; And the other day I was on the phone with a telemarketer and I said a bunch. I said, "Are you going to send that form?" Period. I said, "Period. How many days is that gonna come to my house?" You know, if I if I'm talking here and I say period, somebody please I want the deacons to take my phone away from me because it's getting out of hand. It's so many options, you know, so many things and some of it's good, but then you just, as I said last Sunday, you just you just click in something really quickly that's defiled. How close has it come to us? I just tell you about this new uh app that my wife made me get on and it's called steps app and she's monitoring all the steps I take every day. I didn't like it. I didn't want it. It's accountability. She already calls me every day. Says, "What are you having for lunch? How many carbs are you having? Tell me the number of carbs. You're gonna die." I'm already dealing with that. And now she wants she can see my steps. You know how many steps you get in today. How I can just imagine I'm going to be sleeping ready to go to sleep at midnight and I'm 500 steps short. You're 500 short. You got to get out there and I'm going to get out in the driveway in my pajamas and finish my steps. One day she said, "How come you only have 200 steps today?" I said, 'Well, that's how many steps it was to across the McDonald's parking lot to get to McDonald's and get back. It's accountability. I'm just saying that here we are. How close can all of that out there? Say it's out there and it's not out there. It's right here. &gt;&gt; That's right. And it's the same thing that happened thousands of years ago with the children of Israel. But now it's every image that's an idolatrous image &gt;&gt; can be quickly placed in front of us. And whatever's in your heart that you're craving, &gt;&gt; the devil has something out there to feed that craving. &gt;&gt; What it is to be successful to to you know remember the god of fertility, the god of prosperity. They got all the things to fulfill that desire. Looking for this, looking for that, looking to make more money. It's all there, but it's feeding something within us. I just think that we should go to the Lord. Can you say amen &gt;&gt; to him to meet our satisfaction? I believe that we need to have so filled with the Holy Ghost that they took and purged purged. I don't know how we do that, but I believe the Lord will show you in your life that your temple is so important to the Lord. I know the devil is saying, "I've got it real close to them and they're never going to catch it." But I got news for the devil. I'm preaching it this morning and there's a bride that's going to catch it. &gt;&gt; They're not dumb. They're going to catch it. &gt;&gt; Satan, I'm all over you. I know how close you brought it, but I've caught what's going on. It'd be great if some young people catch it. &gt;&gt; You catch what I'm preaching this morning. &gt;&gt; This is not just an instrument. This is a device of the enemy. We have to use it for the right things, &gt;&gt; but we also have to purge our temple of the wrong things and say, "I value this temple. This house, &gt;&gt; my mind, and my spirit is not a garbage can." &gt;&gt; This belongs to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was thinking of I was thinking of these things and I'll close on this. I was thinking of a fellow I had to look up his name, but I remembered on 911 there was two planes. One went into the Twin Towers, one went into uh the Pentagon, but there was three planes that crashed. And I heard this little story of the wife who wrote a a book about her husband. It was called Let's Roll. And I got to thinking about those people on that third plane. And I so I researched it to see were they sitting there going on the plane and they got news that two planes were taken over by the enemy and they went into the actual cockpit and begin to redirect it into these places and killed thousands of people. Did they know that that was going on? And I found out uh this Todd fella and many others. Now you can you imagine now you're sitting on a plane and you're receiving phone calls and he was talking to a an air airport operator and he informed him right there and he says listen there's two planes being taken over by the enemy. They've already already crashed crashed one into the Pentagon and one into the Twin Towers. Can you imagine sitting there and you're on a plane? Can you imagine listening saying you got to be kidding? But that realization wasn't as serious as when they begin to realize their plane has been taken over &gt;&gt; by the enemy. &gt;&gt; It's tragic when somebody else's plane gets taken over and somebody goes into the cockpit and you watch them fall and crash. It's terrible. But when you're just I want you to put yourself in their shoes &gt;&gt; sitting there. It's tragic. But you have to learn what the enemy has done in other people's lives. But you realize now the same enemy is on your plane. &gt;&gt; May that may that jolt us like it did me. The same enemy is on your plane and he gets off and they get a plan together. Nobody knows what exactly happened, but they do know that that plane was headed, I believe, towards the White House or somewhere in Washington DC. and they rose up and he said, "Let's row. Let's take over." And they ran. And somehow they were able to fight to redirect that and save thousands of other people's lives, knowing that they would probably die. They probably tried to take over that. I'm preaching to you. It's time for you to take over the cockpit of your temple from the enemy. &gt;&gt; If he's sitting in there, it's time to purge your airplane. &gt;&gt; He said, "Are you guys ready?" He said, "Let's row." And that's the last words. And and they took off, tried to to storm and we don't know what they did. All we know is somehow they were able to that thing crashed in Pennsylvania and saved many lives. And we're thankful for that. This a tragic story, but they because they had to die. But I want us to get the same Holy Ghost fervor in our lives. That's not even Holy Ghost. That's just a heart rising to say, I want to save lives. I want to I want to get this enemy out of the cockpit. &gt;&gt; My life will be destroyed here. I got to do something about this. Young person, you got to do something about what I'm preaching today. &gt;&gt; You can't let the enemy sit in the cockpit of your airplane. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz it's going to be a crash no matter what. &gt;&gt; You got to go fight. I don't know how far he got. Maybe he got in that door and he was wrestling and fighting with those men, trying his best to get them out of there. And maybe while he was fighting, trying to save it, that's when it nose dived into. I don't know what happened. We don't know the story, but thank God for that testimony of somebody says, "Let's roll." I'm I'm going to say it to you this morning. Let's roll. Let's roll. Can you say amen? Let's roll. Let's do something about it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because this is not just important. This is the highest value. This temple, this mind, these thoughts, &gt;&gt; my spirit, my emotions, everything that's part of this is has a high value to the Lord. &gt;&gt; And it should have a high value to us personally. &gt;&gt; Lord, I want a personal revival. &gt;&gt; I want the glory of God to come down in this temple. &gt;&gt; Nobody else is wanting it. That's fine. But I want this in my life. What do I need to do to go home and make it and send a message to the Lord that this is important? &gt;&gt; This vessel &gt;&gt; Yes, it &gt;&gt; is important to you. This is your house. Father, come and dwell. Can we stand? This is your house, a holy house of prayer where the lost and the lonely bring their burdens and their cares. This is your house. This is your house. Come and dwell. First verse. Let's sing it together. We dedicate this temple, Lord. You Lord. Make it your prayer this morning. Let your glory fill this sanctuary. Oh, be enthroned on Praise &gt;&gt; your people, Lord. We agree in unity. This is your house. Father, come and dwell. Oh, this is your house. A holy house of prayer. Oh, where the lost and the lonely bring their burdens and their care. This is your house. This is your come and dwell. Oh my Holy Spirit. Oh hallelujah. Yes Lord. Yes Lord. Decorate our heart with grace and mercy. Let healing a hallelujah. Find searching souls. Lord, have your way. We humbly pray. Oh, this is your house. Father, come and dwell. This is your house, Lord. A holy house where the lost and alone come. I want you to bow your heads with me. I want you to think about if you're a vessel person saying that brother Paul I I didn't know this when I was a young person. I have really I I didn't give my vessel to the Lord when I was a kid. Didn't fully yielded and I have made damage to this my mind my spirit my body. I don't know what happened. Maybe you're saying I wish I heard this preaching to warm me when I was young. Maybe you heard it. You didn't value that you were a daughter of God or you're a son of God and that your your vessel was important to him. You know what? God's forgiveness is here for you today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's blood is here to wash it away. And if you got anything out of this today, you ought to know that God is able to restore a temple that's been destroyed. How many say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. God is able to restore and reconcile no matter how much damage. Maybe you're a vessel that you've got full of hurt and full of pain. You've been damaged in your spirit. The things people have said about you. Maybe you've done your own private damage and your own guilty pleasure, so to speak. Pleasure is fine, but it's it's the guilty pleasures of the world that brings guilt and condemnation. And maybe you're you think you're hiding that, but you know it's done damage to your walk with the Lord.
