[0:00] and now it came to pass on a certain day
[0:02] that he went into a ship with his
[0:04] disciples and he said unto them
[0:07] let us go over unto the other side of
[0:10] the lake
[0:11] and they launched forth
[0:14] but as they sailed he fell asleep and
[0:16] there came down a storm of wind on the
[0:18] lake and they were filled with water and
[0:21] were
[0:22] in jeopardy in other words there there's
[0:24] there they're in trouble they're in uh
[0:27] it's a scare it's in other words it's a
[0:29] it's uh it's going to be something
[0:32] that's
[0:32] bad and turn out bad and they came to
[0:35] him and awoke him saying a master master
[0:38] we perish
[0:39] and then he arose and rebuked the wind
[0:41] and the raging of the water and they
[0:43] ceased and there was a calm
[0:45] and he said unto them where is your
[0:48] faith where is your faith
[0:50] and they being afraid wondered saying
[0:53] one to another
[0:54] what manner of man is this for he
[0:57] commandeth even the winds
[0:59] and the water
[1:01] and they
[1:02] obey him
[1:03] anybody notice that jesus tried to
[1:06] address their faith and ask them where
[1:08] their faith was
[1:09] and they were so afraid that they
[1:11] actually turned around and they also
[1:13] acknowledged this is a great man to be
[1:15] around
[1:16] he can speak to the winds and the waves
[1:18] what a great man what manner of man and
[1:20] this can completely miss the question
[1:22] from jesus
[1:24] where is your faith
[1:27] and when we're moving on like we said
[1:29] sunday and going forward the holy spirit
[1:31] his voice will always take us forward
[1:33] never back and especially in our own
[1:36] faith in the word of god
[1:38] and that's why he asked where's your
[1:39] faith i spoke to the winds but where's
[1:42] your faith in my word amen heavenly
[1:44] father blessed tonight bless what we say
[1:47] lord under your anointing and give us as
[1:49] the oracles of god we pray and we pray
[1:51] you just as we commit ourselves to it
[1:54] that lord we know that you're committed
[1:55] to the word and it won't return void may
[1:58] it bless and help and heal and encourage
[2:00] and lord jesus we're
[2:02] very happy to be christians tonight in
[2:04] these last times we wouldn't want to
[2:06] gamble lord with our souls and play any
[2:09] games we just want to know
[2:11] as the prophet proclaimed father we want
[2:13] to know when that day comes that we have
[2:15] our ticket in our hand that we have the
[2:17] token that we're ready to go when the
[2:20] rapture takes place
[2:21] father we just commit the service to you
[2:23] in jesus name amen god bless you may be
[2:26] seated tonight
[2:27] i wanted to speak a little bit
[2:29] uh mainly and get to the quote that i
[2:31] didn't get too sunny and preach on it a
[2:33] little bit we didn't get to that but we
[2:35] certainly had a good time in the house
[2:36] of the lord this past sunday and really
[2:38] enjoyed his presence and we wanted to
[2:41] continue that subject but i will title
[2:43] this tonight
[2:44] beyond crying to speaking beyond going
[2:47] beyond crying
[2:49] to speaking and going forward so beyond
[2:51] crying to speaking
[2:53] and at this moment that we were speaking
[2:56] of sunday i just want to preach a little
[2:57] bit about the red sea although i did
[3:00] sunday i want to go back to it just a
[3:02] moment
[3:03] and we were showing that they were in a
[3:05] tough spot in between pharaoh's army and
[3:08] the red sea and at that moment then
[3:10] everyone began to forget what god had
[3:13] said everyone including moses began to
[3:16] forget god's promise
[3:18] everyone lost sight of god coming down
[3:22] god calling a prophet
[3:24] god given signs to the prophet
[3:26] god's saying i have come to what did he
[3:29] say i come down to do anybody remember
[3:31] i have come down to do what
[3:33] i have come down to deliver you
[3:37] i have come down for one purpose i'm
[3:39] going to deliver you now friends we got
[3:41] to know when god says something then he
[3:43] intends on finishing the job how many
[3:46] believe that
[3:47] when god speaks it then it's as good as
[3:50] in the bag it's as good as done may take
[3:52] 20 years but if god spoke it it's going
[3:55] to be done and their promise was i am
[3:58] come down and i will deliver you
[4:01] but for some strange reason at this
[4:04] moment in the heat of the moment with
[4:06] fairies pharaoh's army behind coming to
[4:08] crush them and the red sea had they
[4:10] completely forgot god's word and began
[4:13] to cry and begin to be afraid
[4:16] and and so god had promised hundreds of
[4:19] years to come he spoke i'll do this he
[4:21] gave him signs and he commissioned moses
[4:24] he commissioned the children of israel
[4:25] to be called out and they actually were
[4:27] called out they actually were there out
[4:29] of egypt that should have been good
[4:31] enough too they were free from egypt
[4:33] they were free from his bondage and god
[4:36] come and put into motion a full exodus
[4:38] away from pharaoh and he sent judgments
[4:41] on egypt and all of this happened and
[4:44] all of a sudden everybody including
[4:46] moses
[4:47] forgets that
[4:48] and that forget the voice that's went
[4:50] out because we said sunday when the
[4:52] voice of god goes out it sets into
[4:55] motion the deliverance of the people
[4:58] when he begins to speak then god's
[5:01] deliverance has already come to the
[5:02] people it's just a matter of us
[5:04] believing it and watching god finish it
[5:07] it's when he speaks is when his voice
[5:09] speaks it has sets power in it it's not
[5:11] the signs can you say a man
[5:14] it's not that we follow the signs but
[5:16] the signs follow us these signs shall
[5:18] follow them that believe
[5:20] but it's not the signs that we follow
[5:22] the voice is enough to get us through if
[5:25] he says it i believe it that settles it
[5:28] and that's the way we should live and
[5:30] that's the way our faith
[5:31] should speak our faith should speak
[5:33] about that god said it i believe it that
[5:36] settled god's already it's already done
[5:38] no matter what kind of pharaoh's army is
[5:40] coming and plaguing our minds and giving
[5:43] a battle to us
[5:44] we should say these words listen god has
[5:46] already said it i believe it
[5:49] that settles
[5:50] it and that's why i say
[5:53] and brother branham said it and here god
[5:56] says it to moses why cry
[5:58] speak you know why god says that
[6:00] why are you crying
[6:02] when i've already spoken
[6:04] then you don't need to cry anymore now
[6:07] you know i'm not against the cries of
[6:08] the heart and god meets the cries of the
[6:10] heart and a lot of times we have great
[6:11] cries in our heart and and we're
[6:13] pleading god for god and i think that
[6:15] gets god attention but when it comes to
[6:17] a word that's already spoken you see
[6:18] friends we don't need a word from the
[6:21] lord for everything
[6:22] in our lives because he's already spoken
[6:25] some things
[6:27] we may pray and say god i need an answer
[6:29] for you whether to buy this or go into
[6:31] this investment and i think we should
[6:33] bring god into every part of our lives i
[6:35] don't think we should say there's this
[6:37] private area that i'll just deal with on
[6:39] my own
[6:40] can i say amen to that i don't think
[6:42] there should be any area of our life
[6:43] that we think is not really god's
[6:46] concern the simplest little detail
[6:48] brother bram says god's concerned with
[6:50] you got a little kid there with us with
[6:52] a scraped knee then you're teaching them
[6:55] lord we're going to take this great knee
[6:57] to you
[6:58] but you got a big knee like an
[6:59] investment or something like that don't
[7:01] ever do that on your own don't ever do
[7:03] something too quickly go to god about it
[7:05] god we need an answer so the things we
[7:07] need an answer for but there are things
[7:09] in the bible and i've pointed this out
[7:11] to people sometimes when they say i need
[7:13] to pray about this and i'll say to him i
[7:15] take him to a scripture and i'll say you
[7:17] don't need to pray about that it's
[7:19] already in the word
[7:21] you don't need to ask god whether it's
[7:23] true or not it's already there there are
[7:26] some things that god says and has
[7:28] already said and we just need to speak
[7:31] and go forward
[7:33] and not cry about it
[7:36] and there's a lot of things he says
[7:37] about us about predestination about our
[7:40] position in jesus christ the position of
[7:42] the bride that's already been spoken by
[7:45] the prophet you need don't need to find
[7:47] out from god you don't need to google
[7:49] and find out certain things we have been
[7:52] spoken to by god in this generation
[7:54] there's so many things that have been
[7:56] settled can you say amen
[7:58] and we ought to live settle because god
[8:01] has settled it by his word
[8:04] we're not worried about what we're not
[8:05] wondering what happened in the garden
[8:07] can you say man we're not wondering
[8:08] whether god's three personalities are
[8:10] one god we're not there's a lot there's
[8:12] a host of things we're not unsettled
[8:14] about in my why because god settled it
[8:18] and god settled it he spoke it and that
[8:20] settles it for me i don't need to be
[8:22] tossed
[8:23] and so now then
[8:25] this this this uh how do you call it
[8:28] just caught in between pharaoh and then
[8:30] here they get in this and they begin to
[8:32] cry out to god and this is what israel
[8:34] didn't know yet is the power of the word
[8:37] of god and the voice of god when he says
[8:40] when he says
[8:41] that you're going to be delivered you're
[8:43] going to be delivery
[8:46] and they had israel hadn't learned that
[8:47] yet even moses is
[8:50] teeter-totter in here because he really
[8:51] didn't need to cry unto god he just
[8:54] needed to speak and go forward
[8:56] i know moses didn't know
[8:58] how god was going to do it
[9:00] but he needed to speak it
[9:02] said god you said you'd deliver us and
[9:05] so i'm speaking and and i'm speaking and
[9:07] i'm taking the people forward
[9:10] because why he already said i'll deliver
[9:12] you
[9:12] so there's no sense in sitting there and
[9:14] entertaining thoughts that you know
[9:16] israel's just going through the
[9:17] scenarios of just being slaughtered out
[9:20] here in the middle of just by the red
[9:22] sea and all of our babies and children
[9:24] and our livestock and they're
[9:26] envisioning everything being slaughtered
[9:28] and pharaoh's army getting the victory
[9:30] and this was just a big this message
[9:32] wasn't true at all and here we are
[9:35] embarrassed out here
[9:36] slaughtered two million of them they're
[9:38] already getting pictures like that in
[9:40] their mind what out of their fear
[9:42] but they should not have had that why
[9:44] because god had spoken
[9:47] they should have been saying i don't
[9:49] know how god's going to do this one
[9:51] but he has to do it because he said he
[9:54] would deliver us
[9:56] oh somebody shout praise the lord
[9:58] [Applause]
[9:59] that's the attitude god wants to see in
[10:01] us and moses had just prophesied and
[10:03] said this day
[10:05] you'll no longer see these guys anymore
[10:07] they will they will be dead this day
[10:09] they'll watch your enemy die he just
[10:11] said it and then he goes to cry he
[10:13] starts to ask the lord what do i do next
[10:16] and that was god's biggest problem with
[10:17] moses is always asking what do i do next
[10:21] israel was crying out of fear
[10:24] but moses
[10:25] was in this habit i got to go to god
[10:27] about this i got to go to about but the
[10:29] commission he was already commissioned
[10:31] to take the people out he was already
[10:33] commissioned for deliverance and when
[10:35] you have been commissioned by god
[10:37] when god has already commissioned you
[10:40] how many tonight that you know that god
[10:43] called you out of a life of sin
[10:46] it wasn't you that just oh i wanted i
[10:49] wanted uh i wanted more of god no no no
[10:52] no god called you when you were even
[10:54] hardly even looking for him
[10:56] and then how many know has he saved you
[10:58] tonight
[11:00] how many knows he positioned you and
[11:02] commissioned you to be a lie to be a
[11:05] light of the gospel of jesus christ
[11:07] we have that commission you should go on
[11:09] into all the world and preach the gospel
[11:11] and and so so here tonight we're called
[11:13] we're saved we're filled with the holy
[11:15] spirit we've been commissioned we've
[11:17] been given our job we've been given our
[11:19] commission and if god has spoken that
[11:21] over your life moses has been given all
[11:24] of that commission and cyril he's saying
[11:26] what do i do next what do i do next if
[11:28] you know your commission then you know
[11:30] what to do next
[11:32] deliver the people
[11:34] you're commissioned to deliver the
[11:35] people for you moms out there you're
[11:38] commissioned to raise your children
[11:39] right now
[11:40] you've been commissioned by almighty god
[11:43] to raise your children
[11:44] someday you'll be finished with that
[11:47] commission
[11:48] and sisters are going oh hallelujah i
[11:50] can't be wait to be done with that
[11:52] because it's tough it's probably might
[11:54] be close to a pastor's job it's a tough
[11:56] job raising kids
[11:58] parents it's a tough job it's no picnic
[12:00] especially raising them in this world
[12:02] that we live in today but listen you've
[12:04] been commissioned you have a mandate
[12:07] from the scripture to raise those
[12:08] children in the admonition of the lord
[12:11] and when they're old they won't depart
[12:12] from it it won't depart from them you're
[12:14] commissioned by god and when you have a
[12:16] commission by god you don't scare away
[12:18] from satan you don't bow out of it can
[12:20] you say amen you don't you don't give up
[12:22] you don't quit can you say amen when
[12:24] you've been commissioned by god you
[12:26] stand there flat-footed god's
[12:28] commissioned me to do this and god will
[12:30] stand by me as i raise my children
[12:34] god will if he's commissioned he'll
[12:35] stand by you and so he started to ask
[12:38] the lord and god got a little upset
[12:40] because why did god get upset because
[12:42] when the voice has already said it you
[12:44] speak it and you walk into it i'm going
[12:46] to read that quote in a minute if you
[12:47] guys want to pull it up when you when
[12:49] god says it then you re-speak it and you
[12:53] walk into it
[12:54] god needed a people to get over there
[12:56] crying
[12:58] and go forward to stop crying and start
[13:01] speaking
[13:03] god
[13:04] needs a people to stop crying
[13:07] and start speaking
[13:10] now we're talking the third pole
[13:14] god needs a people to stop crying
[13:18] and complaining about everything
[13:21] and start re-speaking what he's already
[13:24] said
[13:25] reminding him lord you said this
[13:28] reminding him lord you said in isaiah by
[13:31] your stripes i am healed i'm not
[13:34] speaking it i'm just re-speaking it
[13:36] because god has already spoken it
[13:40] you speak it and you go forward that's
[13:41] what god wants to see of people do he
[13:43] wants to see a people speak it and walk
[13:46] into it god needs the people to stop
[13:48] crying and start speaking and when
[13:50] you're trapped though when you're
[13:51] trapped like these people were trapped
[13:54] his voice
[13:56] will only point you
[13:58] in one direction
[13:59] and we heard this on sunday how many
[14:02] remember brother bill sanchez
[14:04] go forward we go forward
[14:07] when you're trapped by the devil there's
[14:09] only one
[14:11] direction his voice will lead you
[14:14] and that's forward amen
[14:17] amen pray for brother bill he's i forgot
[14:19] to mention something he's actually have
[14:20] covered he had covered last year
[14:23] he got the vaccine a couple two or three
[14:26] months ago has coveted again
[14:28] and uh was in the hospital for it so i
[14:31] didn't know that so i called him the
[14:32] other night but if you would remember
[14:33] him in your prayers
[14:36] uh
[14:36] when when you're trapped
[14:39] his voice will only point in one
[14:40] direction so let's look at this quote a
[14:41] minute if you would
[14:43] god trains his men and this is a
[14:45] wonderful message why christ speak
[14:48] everything i'm saying here is said much
[14:50] better in this service and i'd like to
[14:53] read through all of it but i pulled out
[14:55] just one part of it so we can get the
[14:57] point but what a wonderful message and i
[14:59] will just say this i'll say it a little
[15:00] later but this is an adoption message
[15:03] um paradox is an adoption message after
[15:06] the seals why christ speak as an
[15:08] adoption message remember that we're in
[15:10] the age of adoption we're coming to
[15:12] adoption
[15:13] and why christ speak as an adoption
[15:15] message god trains his men then anoints
[15:18] them gives them experience takes them
[15:20] through the rigid training down through
[15:22] the stands of burning punishment trying
[15:25] testing not only does he do that to his
[15:27] prophets but he does it to his children
[15:31] every son that cometh to god must be
[15:33] chastened and tried tested by his word
[15:35] see when the pinch come the strong time
[15:39] when it faces death are you able to
[15:42] stand there on the word of god and say
[15:44] god said so
[15:46] that settles it
[15:48] that's the test is when you are being
[15:50] tested are you able to stand on the word
[15:54] you may not have a feeling you may not
[15:56] have a sensation there might not be
[15:58] something come down from god where you
[16:00] just feel his presence that's not what
[16:02] he's saying when the test is there when
[16:04] you're up against the red sea
[16:07] what will you say in other words
[16:09] will you stand on the word of god and
[16:11] say god said so that settles it right
[16:13] now god said it that settles it for me
[16:17] and god had called such a man and that
[16:20] man was moses but moses a great deal
[16:23] like us every time it come to a place to
[16:26] something that had to be done moses
[16:28] called out oh lord what must i do in
[16:30] this place now isn't that just like we
[16:33] do
[16:34] god had blessed him and anointed him
[16:37] above his brother give him a message and
[16:39] a ministry that had not been on earth
[16:41] since that day until that day and yet
[16:44] every time something takes place and
[16:46] moses ran off to god with it lord what
[16:48] must i do what must i do in this case
[16:52] stop right there
[16:53] did joshua come
[16:55] to a better place did joshua come to
[16:58] that adoption thing where he wasn't
[17:00] waiting to go find out from god uh what
[17:03] do i need to do in this situation we're
[17:05] fighting all day what do i need to do
[17:07] did joshua go look into his bible did no
[17:10] no he didn't do that he had already been
[17:13] commissioned
[17:15] so joshua's speaking of adopted sons
[17:17] because he earned the commission god's
[17:19] going to destroy the enemy so one day he
[17:21] speaks and says son stand still
[17:24] there wasn't any time necessarily to go
[17:26] ask god what do i do in this situation
[17:28] too lord son stand still and it stood
[17:31] still
[17:32] because he was on this road he was in
[17:35] the in the way to serve the lord and he
[17:38] was commissioned lord what must i do
[17:40] what must i do in this case god kind of
[17:42] got tired of it i believe and said why
[17:45] are you crying to me
[17:47] speak to the people and go forward my if
[17:50] any time ever looked like they ought to
[17:52] retreat was then but god has no
[17:58] retreat that's why i preach sunday
[18:01] there's only one way his voice is
[18:02] leading you and that's forward
[18:05] god has no retreat there's no running
[18:07] away there's no going back
[18:10] to god this is too much i'm going back
[18:12] to my comfort zone no no stay around the
[18:14] holy spirit he gets you out of your
[18:16] comfort zone and makes you step into the
[18:18] fire the three hebrew children just
[18:20] stepped into the fire they didn't run
[18:23] can you say man he said woo-hoo no i
[18:26] didn't get in there and they took off
[18:27] running no they said all right listen
[18:29] we're not we're not worshiping your idol
[18:32] unto the prophet
[18:36] we're not going to worship the prophet
[18:37] daniel
[18:38] he's our brother we're not going to
[18:40] worship him and so listen god is able to
[18:42] deliver us we're going to step into the
[18:44] fire
[18:45] god's able to deliver us but if he
[18:47] doesn't we're still not going to bow to
[18:50] your daniel
[18:51] that's the faith god wants to see
[18:53] there's only one direction those men
[18:55] were headed us right into that fire
[18:58] somebody say praise the lord somebody
[19:00] say praise the lord you haven't said it
[19:01] in quite a while
[19:05] i still can't get some of you to say it
[19:07] all right
[19:09] there's no
[19:10] place to retreat in god
[19:13] go forward
[19:14] the doctor says it's cancer
[19:17] go forward
[19:20] if he says it's tb
[19:22] go forward if the devil says you can't
[19:25] give this up
[19:27] go forward
[19:29] see that's what people they get in a
[19:30] habit
[19:31] they get bound by that addiction
[19:34] might be physical emotional
[19:36] a mind addiction and i believe i believe
[19:39] this is the faith to get you away from
[19:41] that
[19:42] the devil is speaking to people like
[19:44] that and telling you you can't ever give
[19:47] this up you've been doing this 20 years
[19:48] and you'll never give this up
[19:50] and that's where the faith comes in the
[19:52] devil if the devil says you can't give
[19:54] this up you go forward
[19:57] if your home says that you're going to
[19:59] be a fanatic you go forward
[20:01] amen
[20:03] the church turns you out
[20:05] go forward
[20:06] there's no retreating back go forward
[20:08] speak and go forward speak what his word
[20:13] and go forward thus saith the lord and
[20:16] move on
[20:17] cry to the people can you say amen but
[20:19] the people then rebelled and said it had
[20:22] been better that we excuse me died down
[20:24] in egypt
[20:25] it had been better that we had our
[20:27] graves marked then from the hyenas and
[20:30] the vultures to pick up our bones in
[20:31] this wilderness why did you bring us out
[20:33] here after they had seen that god
[20:35] approve approved moses to be a servant
[20:37] and moses fretted with the people and
[20:39] the people fretted to moses and he said
[20:42] what must we do and go forward was the
[20:45] answer
[20:48] praise the lord
[20:49] you're looking for an answer from god it
[20:51] might end up being just go forward
[20:54] but lord i need more details than that
[20:57] you might get an answer from god
[21:01] go forward
[21:02] that was the answer
[21:05] because the holy spirit's always saying
[21:06] that go forward
[21:08] we go forward now they said we are out
[21:10] in this wilderness and the armies of
[21:11] pharaoh is approaching us they're
[21:13] encamped just behind us but moses knew
[21:15] to obey god and if god sends a
[21:17] representative and he anoints this
[21:19] representative and sends it into the
[21:21] world the people must obey that
[21:23] representative it's always been that way
[21:25] all down through the bible moses was
[21:28] called for the job god had said it in
[21:30] the word he would do it he promised that
[21:32] he would send such a thing in that day
[21:34] to deliver them and god did his part
[21:36] sent moses
[21:42] and the children of israel just because
[21:44] little stumbles and things come along to
[21:46] try them they failed to march with moses
[21:50] now isn't that just like today we see
[21:52] the message come forth we see the church
[21:54] rise to a place on the wings of the holy
[21:56] spirit until the power of god thrills
[21:59] every person in there
[22:01] and the glory of god falls around and
[22:02] the signs and wonders take place less
[22:04] than a week satan is permitted to come
[22:06] into that congregation why does he do it
[22:09] god permits it and then the church
[22:11] begins to murmur and fall back you see
[22:14] what's happening now it's god testing
[22:16] his children
[22:17] when the glory of god is falling we have
[22:19] a service like we had sunday it's easy
[22:21] to serve the lord and worship in here
[22:23] can you say man but god doesn't allow it
[22:25] to stay that way because you have to be
[22:27] tested as a son
[22:29] will you stand upon the word when the
[22:31] testing time comes so he he allows satan
[22:34] he allowed pharaoh to be released with
[22:37] all of his chariots and start heading
[22:39] towards them because he's going to test
[22:40] their faith and god says he permits he
[22:43] sends satan he allows satan to come in
[22:45] the church after such glory satan is
[22:48] permitted to come into that congregation
[22:50] why does he do it god permits it and
[22:52] then the church begins to murmur fall
[22:54] back maybe it wasn't so
[22:58] that is where we fail that's the failing
[23:00] of the church regardless of what takes
[23:03] place
[23:04] it's god
[23:06] move
[23:07] forward
[23:10] amen
[23:13] he says it's so much better than i do
[23:17] it's god
[23:19] move forward
[23:20] it's either god or it's not god
[23:23] this message is either of god or it's
[23:25] not of god
[23:26] there's no in between
[23:27] i'm not talking about the outskirts and
[23:29] the cultists things like that this
[23:31] message by itself in its purity in its
[23:33] innocence it's either of god or as it
[23:36] isn't and you've got to settle that in
[23:37] your heart
[23:38] but if it's of god if it was sent from
[23:41] god then we take it and we move forward
[23:44] there's only one direction
[23:48] so i was thinking of something and
[23:50] praying about something here to to
[23:52] to go back and notice this
[23:55] uh certain
[23:56] pressure that comes
[23:58] in people that follow the message isn't
[24:00] it amazing here we have a message go
[24:03] forward go forward when we hit a tight
[24:04] spot when there's doubts arise we should
[24:07] go forward when there's doubts arise be
[24:09] looking for the voice of god to take you
[24:11] forward
[24:13] not back to what you had before
[24:16] isn't amazing that the message came to
[24:17] take us out of organized systems
[24:20] to christ the word
[24:22] and some people went back to
[24:24] denominations
[24:27] i i can't i can't process that in that
[24:29] mind i can understand somebody leaving
[24:32] and i know that's going back to the
[24:33] world but a very calling of god to come
[24:36] out of her my people come out of every
[24:39] organized system everything that's
[24:41] denominational to come out of it
[24:44] that's including if there's
[24:45] outskirts within our ranks that are
[24:47] denominational how many can say amen to
[24:50] that
[24:51] you got to come out of that you got to
[24:52] come out of that church and the quicker
[24:53] you do it the better
[24:55] if you look into all kinds of
[24:56] denominational ways and everything you
[24:58] got to come out of that
[25:00] and so when
[25:02] when we have god calling us out of
[25:04] systems and people go back to it it's
[25:06] amazing thing they're clearly that
[25:08] clearly can't be the voice of god to
[25:10] send you back to something that he
[25:12] called you out of it's satan's influence
[25:14] to take you backwards how many know
[25:16] satan has always taken us backwards
[25:19] satan's always taken us back to our past
[25:22] even today you might have had satan
[25:24] working on you to bring back a thought
[25:26] of something you did in the past
[25:30] satan's a a creature of defeat he he
[25:33] dwells in defeating people and
[25:35] depressing people and keeping one of the
[25:36] ways he doesn't is he reminds you of
[25:38] your past he gets you back thinking
[25:40] about it oh did god really forgive you
[25:43] of that did you really get that all
[25:45] taken care of
[25:46] and so he he the reason he keeps you in
[25:48] your past is because there's defeat in
[25:51] it
[25:52] there's no victory in that
[25:54] no victory in your past whatsoever
[25:56] there's no victory and so he
[25:58] is a creature that that keeps you
[26:01] dwelling on the past all the time to
[26:03] keep you defeated but when the holy
[26:05] spirit comes he says no i won't you're
[26:07] not going to stay in this state i'm
[26:08] leading you forward in your walk with me
[26:11] and to do that first to get over your
[26:13] past we're not going to talk about it
[26:16] we're not going to hash it over we're
[26:17] not going to have a seminar about your
[26:19] past
[26:22] you're going to accept the power of my
[26:24] blood
[26:25] that forgives you and cleanses you of
[26:29] every spot and stain that is in your
[26:32] life
[26:34] somebody ought to say praise the lord
[26:36] i'm going to send you a bleach from the
[26:38] blood of calvary and when you would
[26:40] completely accept it that bleach will
[26:43] take out every stain and send it back to
[26:45] its original woman
[26:48] what do i got to do you got to accept it
[26:50] you got to say lord you did that for me
[26:52] then i accept your blood tonight
[26:56] amen there's no complicating that's why
[26:59] he used that scenario in the message god
[27:01] in simplicity when he got to the end
[27:03] brother branham used that whole thing of
[27:05] the the the the ink he took the ink and
[27:08] he took the bleach and you got this
[27:10] whole tub of ink he said you pour that
[27:12] never mind it being in a piece of fabric
[27:13] a little spot an ink and a a a little a
[27:17] dot from an ink
[27:19] pen why can't i say these words a pen
[27:21] that has ink in it
[27:23] in a little piece no he's talking about
[27:25] a tub of ink he's talking about
[27:28] and he says now
[27:30] now he says you bring that bleach
[27:32] and he says you pour that in there it
[27:35] just obliterate obliterates
[27:37] help me out somebody tonight
[27:41] it's gone
[27:45] it's gone it's gone
[27:47] and he uses it in the message god in
[27:49] simplicity because he never wanted you
[27:52] to complicate
[27:53] and let satan reason with you about the
[27:55] blood no no it's simple when you accept
[27:58] if that's what he done for my past sin
[28:01] let the blood wash every bit of it away
[28:03] and let me be clean
[28:05] hallelujah
[28:06] let it wash everything from my past
[28:09] you see now you can't go forward in the
[28:11] lord until you accept that revelation
[28:14] and take that and once you're standing
[28:16] here and you do that then there's only
[28:18] one direction to go in your spiritual
[28:19] walk and that's forward
[28:23] hallelujah
[28:25] now you're free
[28:27] you're not going back to anything you're
[28:29] moving forward you're saying what's next
[28:30] lord i've been freed of all my habits
[28:33] and my my my sin and my dirtiness and my
[28:36] mind i believe i'm free of it by the
[28:39] blood of jesus christ what's next he
[28:40] said all right i'll show you what's next

[28:44] house of god you're going to be a
[28:45] powerhouse with the holy spirit you're
[28:47] going to become i could never be a
[28:49] powerhouse who told you that he said i
[28:52] come to make you a pillar in the house
[28:54] of god

[32:08] deeper than i've ever been before
[32:12] i just want to love you more and more
[32:16] how i long to be
[32:19] deeper
[32:21] in love
[32:23] i believe he heard our prayer tonight
[32:27] you know in our text as i just bring
[32:29] this to a close this evening and i got
[32:30] the prayer requests we're going to take
[32:31] those and others that you have
[32:35] i read the text in luke chapter 8
[32:37] because it's such a similar situation
[32:40] with the disciples
[32:42] on the boat with jesus
[32:44] and i don't have to go very long at this
[32:46] many preachers have preached about it
[32:48] probably millions since jesus said this
[32:51] this incident happened but our text here
[32:53] is an example of where our faith is
[32:56] sometimes
[32:58] the disciples really were dependent on
[32:59] the first and second poll
[33:03] the people in our generation got really
[33:06] dependent on what god was doing in
[33:08] brother branham
[33:10] for him to say the prayer
[33:13] for him
[33:14] to see a vision about it and when you
[33:16] have that
[33:17] when you have someone that's used of the
[33:20] lord like that
[33:21] then we tend to become dependent on it
[33:25] all of us would do it
[33:28] if jesus were here tonight in his
[33:29] physical body and we know what he can do
[33:32] we would we would bring our burdens to
[33:34] him but we would want him to pray and
[33:36] maybe even see a vision if he could see
[33:38] a vision about what we need to do and
[33:41] all that's fine but remember now the
[33:42] first and second poll that's an
[33:44] attraction to bring us to something
[33:47] deeper
[33:49] and so they were so used to jesus doing
[33:52] things that now
[33:53] when they get in the boat and they go
[33:55] across and the storm comes up they're
[33:57] scared they do what they've been
[33:59] kind of conditioned to do and that's
[34:01] they've got to wake up the master
[34:02] they've got to talk to the master he's
[34:04] got to settle this for him and that's
[34:06] the issue sometimes under the third pole
[34:09] people are really uh
[34:11] tr under the second first example
[34:13] they're trying to really lean on that
[34:14] the problem is the problem is
[34:17] when he's gone
[34:19] then he can't lay hands on you
[34:24] when he's gone
[34:26] he can't see a vision for you
[34:28] so where are you gonna be if he's not
[34:30] there
[34:32] where are you at in the first and second
[34:34] poll if nobody's around
[34:35] well that's the time to go to the third
[34:37] poll is that he's already spoke in his
[34:39] word it is the opening of the word can
[34:41] you say amen and his spoken word and
[34:44] where the question is where is your
[34:46] faith in that word under the third poll
[34:48] we're really trying to see people go
[34:50] higher into adoption paradox why christ
[34:52] speak even earlier
[34:54] even earlier in brother brahma's
[34:55] ministry we see that
[34:58] he referred the people he says if i
[35:00] don't get to lay hands on you he said
[35:02] you have your pastor pray you have your
[35:04] pastor lay your hands on you
[35:07] over and over again he said it because
[35:08] why he was trying to get the people in
[35:10] the mold it doesn't have to be me it
[35:12] doesn't have to be me to see a vision
[35:14] god is still here even when i'm gone can
[35:16] you say amen my wife looked it up one
[35:18] time years and years ago you wouldn't
[35:20] believe the hundreds of places he says
[35:22] have your pastor pray for you have your
[35:24] pastor lay hands on you and that's
[35:26] brother branham himself saying that
[35:27] because he knew he had to get the people
[35:29] to lift their faith even if there's no
[35:31] one there to lay hands on you
[35:34] where is your faith can you say amen
[35:37] where is your faith
[35:40] amen and so now of course they ran to
[35:42] him on the boat and woke him up and said
[35:44] master what are we going to do in this
[35:46] situation and he said to his disciples
[35:49] where is i'm going to word it this way
[35:51] where is your faith
[35:53] amen i know i have faith in the speak to
[35:55] the storm but where's your faith
[35:59] when we hit a test he's asking us
[36:02] where's your faith
[36:05] then they didn't even
[36:06] get it
[36:08] and they said
[36:09] jesus said where is your faith and they
[36:12] said hey brothers
[36:14] what kind of man are we around here this
[36:16] is amazing what manner of man of this
[36:18] that can speak he
[36:20] reaches out to the edge of the boat said
[36:22] peace
[36:23] be still
[36:24] and the storm just goes away
[36:27] jesus said where's your faith and they
[36:29] said brothers did you just see that this
[36:31] is an amazing man
[36:33] i feel privileged to be around this man
[36:35] hello
[36:36] did you get the question he just asked
[36:38] you completely went over it because they
[36:41] were so used to being around the man
[36:46] and him doing it
[36:48] but he's trying to get them
[36:51] where's your faith i won't be here
[36:54] forever
[36:56] you need the holy ghost and you need
[36:58] faith in the word yourself because
[37:00] you're going to hit some storms
[37:04] and greater is he that is in you that
[37:05] he's in the world
[37:07] though i will be with you even in you
[37:09] till the end of that i will be with you
[37:12] if i go away i'll come again through the
[37:14] holy ghost and live in you praise me to
[37:16] god
[37:18] so where is your faith and they said
[37:21] what manner of this man is this that
[37:23] we're around that can speak to the storm
[37:25] completely missed what jesus was trying
[37:28] to teach and so i want to end on this
[37:30] the key to all of this the key to
[37:33] everything in this text is that once the
[37:36] word has been spoken once the third poll
[37:40] the opening of the word has happened and
[37:42] i said it sunday when the breaking forth
[37:44] of the the voices of the thunders and
[37:46] the utterances when when god descended
[37:48] and began to break this voice of god out
[37:51] to the people there's no stopping it
[37:53] there's no going back there's nothing
[37:55] satan can do to stop it it's been
[37:58] launched out into the earth
[38:01] we're living under that friends we're
[38:04] living under these voices and
[38:06] the cry of this christ who said he cried
[38:09] with a loud voice we're living
[38:11] underneath that and satan can't do
[38:13] anything about it this bride is headed
[38:16] to a rapture no matter what satan does
[38:22] because his voice has already spoken it
[38:24] so the key to this is the third pope the
[38:27] opening of the word once that has
[38:28] happened then we re-speak what he said
[38:32] and we go forward
[38:34] why because it's all ready done
[38:38] it's already done
[38:41] so when they
[38:45] i'm ending
[38:46] pretty good ten after eight i'm gonna
[38:48] end
[38:49] we'll take our prayer requests
[38:51] so when they're
[38:52] by the shore
[38:54] and they're all sitting there talking
[38:56] and jesus says
[38:58] let's get in the boat
[38:59] and let's go over to the other side
[39:04] listen okay
[39:06] let's do what he says
[39:08] get in the boat okay
[39:10] you don't realize the third pole had
[39:12] been spoken
[39:13] from their lord
[39:16] you get it
[39:18] once they got in that boat
[39:20] according to what he said
[39:22] they were going all the way over to the
[39:25] other side
[39:27] and i don't care if 10 katrina's hit
[39:32] 50 itas
[39:35] tornados
[39:38] i don't care what hit that ocean or sea
[39:41] of galilee
[39:42] it didn't matter because that tends to
[39:44] get a lot of storms
[39:46] i don't care what hit
[39:48] they were going to survive
[39:51] because isn't it nice that jesus said
[39:55] let us
[39:57] go over
[39:59] he didn't say
[40:03] a few of us are going to make it over
[40:07] i love it he included everybody in the
[40:09] boat
[40:10] can you say man all that i'll make you
[40:12] smile tonight
[40:13] he included everybody and he says let us
[40:16] go over to the other side so when the
[40:19] storm come i'm just asking you how do
[40:21] you think the disciples should have
[40:22] reacted when the storm come
[40:25] crying fear
[40:26] wake up the master
[40:28] no they should have been said but wait
[40:30] brothers wait wait wait settle down here
[40:32] settle down
[40:34] didn't jesus say when we're on the shore
[40:36] let us go over to the other side
[40:40] and that should have been it
[40:42] let the storms rage
[40:44] because we be going over to the other
[40:46] side
[40:48] amen amen
[40:52] hallelujah
[40:54] [Applause]
[40:55] they just needed to re-speak it and they
[40:57] reached
[40:58] that's what they should have done just
[40:59] re-speak it
[41:01] and go forward can you say amen this
[41:04] going beyond crying
[41:07] beyond crying
[41:09] to speaking
[41:11] you know babies
[41:13] eleanor's at that stage she did it today
[41:15] she did a few hours ago at the house
[41:19] ellie
[41:20] wanted something
[41:22] and she
[41:24] what does she do it's not crying it's
[41:26] just like a
[41:27] fussy
[41:30] and she's learning how to talk but it's
[41:31] just got to be to get something it's
[41:33] like
[41:36] [Music]
[41:39] and it's her mom or nana corrected her
[41:41] today again say you know just what what
[41:44] do you want that's not the way and
[41:45] that's the way she tries to get some and
[41:47] we have tolerance for that because
[41:48] that's babies
[41:50] but if they were doing that at 10 years
[41:51] old
[41:53] there's an issue
[41:56] they're hungry and they come into the
[41:57] kitchen at 10 and go
[42:01] i might do that to my wife i don't know
[42:05] we've got to get out of babyhood
[42:08] where you cry for everything
[42:11] and you grow up and speak
[42:13] god's language as an adult
[42:17] oh god it's the end of the world
[42:23] grow up why cry
[42:26] stand true footed
[42:28] i'm gonna speak his word we're going to
