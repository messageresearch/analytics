of Christ we believe you can be fed and we pray that you'll be blessed visit our website for more information at literallife.church may God bless you my friend and may the music and message encourage you today [Music] thank you [Music] you might not recognize me now and those chains the ones surrounds me are laying on the ground you can't keep digging up my past you may have had a laugh or two but you don't get the last you might not recognize me now and maybe I was fine but now I see it maybe I was bound but now I'm free and maybe need reminded you're under my feet yeah [Music] [Music] if you want scars I'll show you scars all the wounds upon the hands of life to pierce the dark dark if I were you I'd be afraid cause everything you meant for Guilt the cross is met with Grace whoa baby yes [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] yeah maybe this is [Music] [Applause] [Music] First Corinthians 12 and 31 is just one scripture and we'll continue talking about the more excellent way the bride's more excellent way and Paul mentions it in the Bible here first Corinthians 12 and verse 31 he says but covet earnestly the best gifts and the reason that Paul mentions the gifts of the Spirit is because he's just spent several chapters talking about the gifts and not just talking about gifts that work in the church but he's actually correcting how they were using them and making sure they're in order and making sure it doesn't get off track and there's another reason Paul corrects it is that we tend to when we have the gifts we tend to get just a bit carnal with them in that we lean on something the gifts more than they do more than The Giver of the gifts and that's car that's human tendency is that when you have a gift if you have a big display of Miracles and signs and wonders which Our God can do we've had here in the church cancer healed we've had testimony is around the world of the Dead being raised you say well my I don't ever hear that well it's happening because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's able to do everything he's ever done before he's able to do it this morning again so you can imagine now your habit that you have you think you'll never overcome nothing is too hard for the Lord if he can heal the sick he can raise the dead still then God can do anything this morning and so you see then that that Paul is not only talking about coveting the best gifts he's never eliminating the gifts but there's a tendency in human beings to gravitate towards the visible and to the manifestations and to the healings and the physical things and we get you know excited rah-rah about it but our tendency is to cling to seeing the gifts and not have a relationship with The Giver and and not have the substance of what the giver wants to bring from our lives and what he wants to bring from our lives is not just Miracles and signs and wonders and signs following life he's wanting to bring Holy Ghost manifested Divine love from our lives and this is what Paul refers to now as he says covet earnestly the best gifts all you Corinthians yet show I unto you a more excellent way and then he takes the next chapter and he begins to explain the more excellent way and that's what we're going to by the grace of God do this morning so here's I want to begin with something uh that William Branham said the first quote here and and he's referring to this scripture Paul talking up to the Corinthians about the more excellent way and I just the reason I brought it into our PowerPoint is I wanted to bring some of the quotes in this PowerPoint and also I wanted to bring this in a teaching because today the Lord willing I want to break down the more excellent way I want to break down the attributes of this love and in order to do that I just want to open it with just this quote and William Branham was a had a powerful Ministry in the 50s and 60s and we believe that he fulfilled scripture even to bring us back to Bible faith if you're interested in hearing more of that which certainly would share anyone here would share more of that with you but I'm going to read from what something he said in a sermon and it's just a powerful thing and as he refers to Paul correcting the Corinthians he says listen at that Stern old Apostle drive it into this Sensational church now he taught he called the Corinthians a sensational church and that means they were more about sensation than they were substance and he said listen to this old uh Stern old Apostle drive it into this Sensational Church who is basing their hopes upon sensation now this is Sunday school this is a place of Correction this is a place of teaching and woe unto the man that will stand in the pulpit and mislead brother it's time that we've made you're compared with scripture that's right and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor Paul said though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it prevaileth me nothing see all your good works all your good deeds all the spiritual things you have all the gifts you have all the sensations you have all the joy you have all the peace you have has nothing at all to do with it to begin with think of that just a moment and think of the churches today our great churches Presbytery Aryan Methodist Baptists and denominational they think because they say I Believe come in put your name on the book and that settles it that settles it how far they're off and so there is dealing with just coming and putting your name on a book and that's good enough then he goes into the Pentecostals in the next one he says our Pentecostal people think well because they got a little sensation they felt good they spoke with tongues they got a blood in their hand oil in their face or something we got it we got it oh 10 million miles off you get it see how the devil as the God of this world has blinded the eyes of those and they just go right on living like that listen for although I bestow all my goods to feed the poor though I give my body to be burned and have not charity I am nothing look at all those gifts all those good things I feed the poor I got a good heart about me I do this I do that I go to church I speak with tongues I prophecy I prophesy I heal the sick I preach the gospel I do these things Paul said Still Still I am nothing all those things can be carnally impersonated the devil can imitate all of these good works and that's why when you come to the Lord and come to the message of the last days it's not just books and tapes and good works and wearing the right dress and wearing the right clothes can you say man you've got to have the substance of the Holy Ghost living in you or and because why do you have to have Holy Ghost love why do you have to have the substance of the Holy Ghost because true Holy Ghost love cannot be imitated cannot be impersonated but all these gifts they can be impersonated so if you just had the gift Satan can impersonate them now once again Paul's not dumping out the gifts he's not dumping out going to church he's not dumping out the tongues and interpretation he's not saying any of that he's just saying that if you live on that and don't have the substance and have not charity it doesn't mean anything you could put your name on the church book and say I'm fine that's all I need to do that's the intellectual side as long as I believe all the mysteries of the Bible that's fine all the Mysteries revealed and then he swings in the rest of the quote to the other side and Pentecost will say because I shouted because I smoke in tongues because I had a sensation I'm fine I'm good and Paul all the way back 2 000 years ago is saying you can swing either way and not have the right thing this right is called to find this more excellent way my Hunger is that I find this more excellent way more so than a gift more than preaching more than singing more than doing good works I want to find this more excellent way because Paul preached it and I believe at the end time is when this bride comes into that atmosphere to manifest Divine love so we shouldn't leave on just live on just what we do as good works and so now Paul he's going to break things down in the most beautiful words I believe about agape love that's ever been said I believe he's going to be begin to express what is this in First Corinthians 13 and many of you have read it probably everybody's read it and see and so what is what this what is Paul's going to bring is the evidence of this mature Capstone love and what it looks like in our everyday life what it looks like in a Christian's life he's going to begin to break down the attributes of this Capstone love and what it looks like in our life and most of it is manifested towards others we know we love God can you say man but it's it's when we what we're expressing in Christ is not meant just to express to God but it's to be expressed and manifested to everyone else and also it's to be expressed to very difficult situations meeting up with difficult people and a lot of times you think you're thinking of somebody outside the boss or something or the lady who who uh drove by you and got mad at you because you you stayed too long at the red light because you were texting and she comes by and gives you the wrong finger and all that stuff you see but you think it's people like that we need to love that person anyway but the greatest challenge is the people we live with every day because we know them so well and they they know how to get our gizzard they know how to say the right things so this comes down to everyday life so we're going to talk about there's 15 characteristics in this love and I don't want you to read them as if this is some type of code to live by or sometimes if I can just do this and get the what would Jesus do bracelet and if I can be more like him and imitate these things don't approach these things this way because Divine love is not something that we put on it only comes by him who is Love by the Holy Ghost but when we have the Holy Ghost if we'll break down our walls and are Prejudiced and all the things and our hurts from the past and be free this is what comes out of Capstone love love is patient love divine love is kind love is not jealous love does not brag or boast this Divine capsule love is not proud or arrogant this Divine love is not rude to anybody love is not self-seeking love is not easily provoked to anger Divine Capstone love does not keep a record of others wrongs Divine Capstone love does not rejoice with injustices or iniquity it doesn't gloat or get happy over some injustice that's done and they got what come what's coming to them they did they do not rejoice with injustices or iniquity love rejoices in something it rejoices when truth prevails love bears and protects things that's what Bears all things means it means to protect things love protects things love bears all things we're going to find out the meaning of that it's hard for me not to go into the meetings right now but I just want you to see them all love bears and protects all things and remember now I'm not making this up when Paul said I'm going to show you a more excellent way this is the more excellent way love bears and protects love love believes the best of things first love always has hope for all things and love endures and holds up during difficulties I'm going to break these things down and I've been breaking them down looking at the Greek words for these words looking the Amplified looking through different things researching it and I don't want just man's opinion but I want to know what these words mean when he says love is patient and that's the first one love is patient the scripture says now we exhort your brother and warn them that are unruly Comfort the feeble-minded support the weak be patient toward all men and the Amplified we earnestly urge you Believers admonish those who are out of line the undisciplined the unruly the disorderly admonish those ones give them a slight rebuke because they're out of line they're undisciplined they're unruly give them a slight rebuke do that to those who are unruly encourage the timid those who lack spiritual courage courage encourage the timid help the spiritually weak these are things that we want to do as Christians be patient with everyone always controlling your temper so when we look at this word patient it means that It suffers long it never gives up it is slow to lose its patience it does not demonstrate irritations or reflect anger or have a quick temper I'm going to say that again it does not demonstrate irritations or reflect anger or have a quick temper and as I said these things are really tested in the people we live around every day more than anybody else the Greek word for patient comes from two words meaning long tempered long tempered that's in the Greek if you're patient you're slow to anger you endure personal wrongs without retaliating if you bear with others imperfections false differences you bear with other people's imperfections faults and differences you give them time to change room to make mistakes without coming down hard too quickly on them do you do that men with your wife and children he's asking some questions as a pastor here do you do that with others do you do that with your wife and children at home you you give them time to change room to make mistakes without coming down hard you bear with other imperfections faults and reminding you of the scripture he said be patient with everyone always always controlling your temper so this patience it goes further just just little human patience it's divine love patience it's his patience Express and you know the reason you know the best place we can see it God's Divine patience with you all this originates in God can you say Amen how much patience has he had with you how many times should he have lost his temper over you but when this flows from the very throat of God through the Bride of Jesus Christ there's a patience that goes beyond just human patience can you say Amen and it goes beyond here's here's an example of it going Beyond in the late 1500s Dr Thomas Cooper edited a dictionary with the addition of 33 000 words and many other improvements to the dictionary he had already been collecting materials for eight years eight years he did this when his wife a rather difficult woman went into his study one day while he was gone and burned all of his notes under the pretense of fearing that he would kill himself studying too much she burned everything eight years of work a pile of Ashes Dr Cooper came home saw the destruction asked who had done it his wife told him boldly that she had done it the patient man heaved a deep sigh and said oh Dinah Dinah thou has given a world of trouble thou has given a world of trouble that's the way they said it back in back then thou Dinah Dinah you have given thou have given a world of trouble that's all he said then he quietly sat down to another eight years of hard labor to replace the notes which she had destroyed that was it next time you think you've arrived at being patient I'll read that story to you again the next one is love is kind love is kind be kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you in the Amplified it says be kind and helpful to one another tenderhearted compassionate understanding forgiving one another readily and freely just as God in Christ also forgave you so the first thing that we see about the kindness of divine love kindness being expressed to one another it is closely related to forgiveness the word forgiveness is mentioned with kindness because really you can't manifest true kindness towards someone unless you're forgiving to someone it's when we're not kind is that when we're not being forgiving we haven't forgiven them for something we're holding a grudge of something they did to US 10 years ago they're never going to be in in my eyes the same they did this that's it that's an unforgiving Spirit that'll bind you did you realize it's not binding them it's binding you be kind and helpful to one another tenderhearted not hard-hearted tenderness tenderhearted may the Lord Jesus I pray this morning take the harshness out of my heart towards people take the hard bitter years of things and then when somebody does a similar thing to me my heart becomes hard again oh God deliver me from that give me a tender heart towards everybody no matter what they've done past present or future the only thing that's going to come out of this vessel is kindness towards that person it's the kindness tender heart and gentle has ability to soothe hurt feelings to calm and upset person to help quietly in practical ways and the reason I'm saying this is the Greek word comes from a word meaning useful this is the kindness in the Greek word is useful a kind person is disposed to be helpful instead of instead instead of being not helpful if you got a bad attitude towards them that's not helping the matter if you're gossiping about him that's not helping people but kindness becomes useful how can I become useful to see a result of this kind person is disposed to be helpful he seeks out needs and looks for opportunities to meet those needs without repayment he is tender and forgiving when he or she is wronged he expresses kindness this kindness responds with kindness to people that are being harsh towards you Bible says in the Old Testament a soft answer turns away Wrath a soft kind answer it turns away Wrath and so be kind to one another tender heart and forgiven it's tied to forgiveness in fact forgiveness is the spirit that would actually make a person be more kind forgiveness there needs to be more talk about forgiveness God's forgiveness God's love of forgiveness it's hard to forgive others when we haven't really realized the complete forgiveness God has given us it starts with us before we can give it out you have to examine yourself how much has God forgiven you and if some of you think well he hasn't had to forgive me for a lot because I haven't really done a lot bad so you're looking at the other person and they're bad that's really bad but your bad isn't that bad who put you in charge of terming determining what was bad my Bible says he that's guilty of the least is guilty of the whole we got level smoking and drugs and drinking and all this and we got bad that's really bad that's bad but in God's books I can go back there to Psalms or Proverbs somewhere it is he says the seven things that God hates and there wasn't any smoking and drinking in there it was one who sows Discord among the Brethren it was one who has hatred in their heart that's the things God hates so who determines what's bad and if you're saying my bad is not as bad as bad this guy's bad bad's bad you already have something bad you have pride you have a religious spirit you think you're better than everybody you never find the Forgiveness that you need to forgive somebody else unless you look at yourself first because whatever they did you without God are capable of doing the very same thing I didn't expect to say this this morning but I'm saying it you without any of God in your life are capable of doing everything that person that's so bad that you think and you can't forgive you're capable of it you would do it without any restraints you would have done the same thing you would have looked at the same thing you would have committed adultery the same way now we start to come into feeling unworthy before God and then grateful to God that the only way that I worry Worthy is because of Calvary because before that person stuck a needle in his arm before that person got addicted to pornography before that person become an alcoholic before they did any of that they were already a sinner unacceptable to God so don't give me these levels of different things that say Lord I realize you've really forgiven me of a lot forgiveness is tied to kindness if you have something in your heart to forgive you're going to be more kind to people can we do one more today love is not jealous love is not jealous so before I read the scriptures it says here about jealousy now the word means it leans in the Greek to an eagerly desire and is used both positively and negatively in your Bible jealousy in the negative senses related to Greed and selfishness the jealous person wants what others have he wants things for himself he is too selfish to applaud others success James says now we're in the Book of James jealousy is often the source of quarrels and conflicts by James 4 2 from Winston Wars and fightings among you come they not of your own lust so so um jealousy most the time is the source of arguments and quarrels and fussing Dwight Moody said I'd rather win souls than win arguments it's a good feeling to Wagon win an argument to argue to get okay and you won at the end that's why we do it there's a jealousy to to want to win I'm going to win I'm going to win what if we were just to let that go and release and release that jealousy and release all that back and there'd be less arguments there will be less fusses less fightings less Wars see Lord kill all the jealousy in me I don't want to have any jealousy and if we kill the jealousy we kill the arguments we kill more of the tension what kind of homes would we have if we say Lord take the jealousy in my heart and Lord Purge it by the holy spirit this to me is the Revival of the Bride this is the Capstone love she comes into the whole culmination of the entire message that you believe all culminates I believe in this Capstone love and living it every day by the Holy Ghost thank you for watching our message today if you would like
