TRANSCRIPT
========================================
bless you all I won't be singing any songs I have learned to stay in my Lane and we'll do that perhaps we can just open with a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we thank you very much for your goodness and Grace do us Lord I just ask that you bless your word to us this evening father I pray that you had ministered in in Clarity father and that we would all be better founded upon your word Lord and we could see you more clearly in our lives even in areas of Our Lives as we hadn't seen your influence before Lord I pray you would move an us tonight in Jesus name amen amen you may be you may be seated well this last weekend I think about 10 of us uh brothers made it down to uh Tennessee for the men's meeting with the brother Berry and other brothers and it was a real uh real joy and a real blessing to be down there I was a a late registrant and I was I was glad I made it it was it was a blessing and we won't talk about that this evening but it's not to be missed and uh uh this evening by God's grace we're going to talk about um the church age of Smyrna this is the the first service will be taking on the on this particular Church agent uh brother Brandon mentioned he'd forgotten to send the notes out maybe that was a good thing because I thought man if everybody see as I was putting this together last night I have all these uh different historical quotes about this or that and I don't intend to go over everything literally with him if somebody's interested I'll put them in here and they want to read it can read it that you don't can skip over it but if you've read all they said men maybe I'll skip tonight's Services it's not a history lesson but uh that worked out quite fine but um I'm going to try to do um two things this evening if we can then I'll just try to keep an eye on the clock back there um I want to take time in looking at the conditions in the in Smyrna and that in that time period because Revelation chapter one says it's a book of Prophecy so the the seven churches described in chapters two and three aren't just literal Assemblies of people at the time of uh John and John was writing at the end of the first century they're also uh parallel conditions in different time periods throughout church history I think it's really interesting to look back we can look at the Ephesus and that was the Apostle Paul was the messenger there and we can see clearly what the Apostle Paul's message was because it's right in the scripture but as the spirit of antichrist gradually crept into the church it gets harder and harder to to trace the the the the the threat of Truth as it goes and irenius was just two steps away from Jesus's disciples he studied under polycarp who studied under John the Beloved so he he he has a very close link to what the original truth was and I find it very satisfying and and the real blessing to see the things that brother Branham taught in the 20th century irenius is saying the same things and there's some other of a battle between uh Church historians sometimes people like to make him Catholic in different ways and you'll see I'm trying to find a good graphic to put on there of irenius but they've all got these Halos over his head and I'm holding his hands a certain way because that's the way they do the crosses and the different masses but if you look what he says he wasn't Catholic the things that he ministers they mesh very well with what Paul preached and with whatever Brandon preached and I just wanted to start off with this scripture from the book of Jude versus verses three and four and Jude writes beloved when I gave all diligence to right unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and to exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints and I want to show the city that this is what irenius was doing ireneus was earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints because false Doctrine was creeping in there with great rapidness in that second century and brother Brandon doing the same thing in the 20th century we're doing the same now contending for that faith that was once delivered for the Saints for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and deny the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ if you continue to read Jude I'm kind of thinking back to the session two weeks ago on the serpent seat talking about how this there were two seed lines in there and this is the false fines creeping in there Jude is giving a pretty good genealogy of how the false lines creeping in to the church and a lot of the names that he mentioned as being part of the false line brother Branham names them right away the gang saying of Korra Etc um he's following both of them are kind of following the trail of the sermon because the Judah said we need to contend for that faith that was delivered to the Saints so here we have a map of Asia Minor Smyrna that was the ancient name of the city I think it's now called it is now this location of the city of Izmir in in Turkey but Smyrna means bitter it's taken from the same word um that is for myrrh and myrrh is used in embalming uh the dead when they're making a mummy of someone and that's kind of what's starting to happen in this church Age Death is creeping in brother Branham says it was a it was a bitter age filled with death the two Vines within the framework of the church were drifting further apart with an increased bitterness toward the True Vine on the part of the false and he says it goes on to say death was not only the seed of the false Vine but even in the True Vine there was a creeping paralysis and impotence because they had already drifted away from the unadulterated truth of the first years after Pentecost and he makes this good statement No True Believers any stronger and spiritually healthy and Alive than his knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of God and that is such a battle there in that second Church age to continue holding on to the true word of God there are all kinds of false doctrines irenius he wrote a book called against heresies actually a series of of pamphlets especially against the Gnostic heresies and they were trying to exalt themselves we're special holders of mysteries we've got special secret knowledge that there's a greater than whatever the apostles taught and you have to in order to see what really truth is you've got to see it our way and have our Revelation and irenius's passion was bringing him right back to the scriptures right back to the scriptures and all his tracks of things he was writing is bringing right back to the scriptures and we and where we are now we think the scripture it's it's clearly acknowledged this is the Bible this is the second century this Canon of scripture the the books that are accepted as being inspired of God that's a pretty recent thing and armenius keeps pointing back he's quoting John the Beloved he's quoting Peter he's quoting Paul these are people who had just died within the last hundred years or so maybe not even that far away so he's giving these people who who were almost contemporaries he's giving them a great amount of Spiritual Authority and that's that's quite an accomplishment he's bringing them back toward the scripture toward what God has been doing and that's what we need to that's still what we need to do it's so easy to take our cues from Everest popular day what um the the things expressed in the in pop music and and and popular movies those are things we're watching they have an impact on how we think and what we think is acceptable and good but brother Brandon mind is no true believers any stronger and spiritually healthy and Alive than his knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of God the book of Hosea says my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge I think a lot of people today it can be said they could very well be destroyed because they have a lack of knowledge of God's saying it's right there but you've got to be willing to take it and and live by it the smyrnan age brother Branham says was the rain the Sun the nourishment that ensured the vile corruption that would confirmed the church in idolatry which went on especially in the in the pergamian age and a couple of the characters I just want to kind of go through um their I took a couple of excerpts from some different quotes but on the screen a couple years ago I read a couple books of church history I'll be quoting from from a couple of them but this book from it's called the the Christian tradition a history of the development of Doctrine this particular scholar says that when the apocalyptic Vision became less Vivid which means people are no longer really expecting the Lord to be coming they're not they're not an expectation of his return this vision of Christ soon returned that's fading away the church polity or their or their the church system is becoming more rigid what happened then he says the extraordinary operations of the spirit there were a characteristic in the early church diminished so basically it's nicolaitanism set in people weren't living with expecting Christ's return just getting into their Church system the spirit stopped operating that's what they said I just find this really neat um brother Brigham says it but it Bears it out in history he said go look up in histories you'll find it and and you do find it it says the decline in the eschatological hope the decline in the hope of Christ's return and the rise of the monarchal Episcopal the rise of denominationalism this is sort of closely interrelated phenomena brother Branham says the same thing if it's hard to accept it from Brother Brahm take from the church historian because that's what happened so the so the church they don't have um the Holy Spirit moving in their midst like they did they're dying so he says we have to validate our existence somehow do we do this and the supernatural brother Brandon points to the supernatural as a Vindication of God that that is a big part of it and that he wasn't the only one who did this there was a one of the first apologists one of the first preachers who was trying to defend the faith to non-christians in this case he was defending the Christianity against Judaism Justin Martyr says that Christianity is Right Judaism isn't because among us we still have prophetic gifts and they have died Out Among the Jews and prophetic gifts the movement of the Holy Spirit that's a that's an affirmation that Christ is with that God is with us so the church has to has to valet its existence somehow and they started doing that not by looking to the future of Christ's promised return um but they instead looked to the to the Past God was with us back then so where he's still going to be with us now and they would look through the past through a particular set of glasses they would look through the past illumined by the composition of the apostolic Canada looked by it to the by the Canon by the Creeds and they'll look at the past in that way and the app and the establishment of the apostolic episcopy which is the the system so they weren't looking at what God was doing now because God wasn't doing anything with him right now they weren't looking to what God was going to be doing in their future and Christ would be coming because they weren't living for that anymore they had to look what God did in the past and he says in this way the apostles became a sort of spiritual aristocracy and the promises of the New Testament on the coming of the Holy Spirit were referred primarily back to the Pentecostal event that's what we see right now happening that happened in the 20th century because Holy Spirit wasn't really moving in the churches because they they had a more rigid system they weren't an expectation of scripture being fulfilled they were missing it so the spirit stopped moving so we have to validate our existence another way if we're not seeing the holy spirit in our churches we'll just say he wasn't promised to be moving here he promised he promised to come in the past and he did and now we're just kind of got to hold things steady that's what happened then it happened now but Arrhenius was called it's like where the brand name is called and we are called to contend for that Faith which was once delivered to the Saints it's a battle that never stops where all God servants are always in the always in the trenches for that so brother Brandon this is from uh on page middle of page two brother Brandon saying these things um much more readable English he says but see what was happening back there that false Vibe was getting a hold and it was teaching that rulership by man was right it thought that the church had to be governed and thought of control over the people but instead of doing it God's way they simply took Authority and devastated all the spiritual power in their own hands and came out with a holy priesthood standing between God and the people they went right back to the old aaronic system and they they became Antichrist for they disposed of his own mediatorship and imposed their own brother Brandon actually says a lot more clearly we kind of put him off to the side so he that can be hard to understand but if you compare these two guys I'd rather brother Britain is a lot clearer um so you can see um this very same things that brother Brandon is saying in Trish historians say it and that it's verified by the Bible so in this as as this Sumerian church is death is setting in here and brother Branham talks about that that it was just he says it was the uh it was the the sun and the um the rain the sun and the nourishment that just that's fed that false Vine and and brought about that that corruption they needed the messenger to bring them uh to to sustain them in the truth and brother Brandon says I chose irenius because I believe that irenius was closer to scripture than polycarp was polycarpone kindly towards the Roman idea of setting up an organization but irenius was firmly against it and then the great issue is coming from the Nicene Council that God was three or one and irenius took the side that God was God now and just one and we're going to take a look at that it's interesting to see how irenius teaches about the gaunted but he's also Vindicated by his his churches were Vindicated by the moving of the supernatural brother Branson his church is in France were known to have the gifts of the Spirit among them for the Saints spoke in tongues they prophesied to raise the dead healed the sick he saw the danger of any kind of organized Brotherhood he stood solidly for a unified Spirit-filled gift manifesting local church and God honored him for the power of God man with the power of God manifested among the saints this is the test one that brother Branham tells about him and I thought it's really neat in this uh in this history does irenius described the many Brethren the church of his day you had these prophetic charismatic or gifts speaking in tongues by the spirit bringing about the secrets of men's hearts and the mysteries of God he had this historians say that brother Graham's not making it up this is this is how irenius was but you can see if you tried to find a picture of irenus he's going to look really Catholic in whatever picture you have but if you look what he taught he wasn't Catholic but how the church just tries to adopt and make him one of their Saints one of their great teachers but but he wasn't um let's see here um on on page um three you want to take a look at his teaching of of the godhead it's important that um he teaches the godhead from from a Biblical um perspective instead of a Greek philosophical perspective in the accounts of nicaea these Bishops gather together and they were thinking in very much terms of the concepts of Plato and Aristotle were completely foreign to the scripture but when irenius teaches it um they're in the middle of Page Three the picture that he uses of God is God moving down through history and on the one hand is is is the sun working in the other hand is the holy spirit these are the two hands how God works with man but it's all one person you don't have multiple people so if person's in the godhead but you have God who manifest himself one way and manifest himself the other way but it's one God irenius doesn't doesn't deviate from that and if you think back when we talked about the godhead back in the spring I was we talked about how some how the doctrine of the Trinity might trade it's almost like they're trying to dissect God where is the holy spirit right now and this is this this is the holy spirit's baileywick this is God the father's section this is God the son section they just got to stay right there but it's not that way it's like trying to find the nuclear the the electron in an atom I mean it it defies uh uh uh it it defies a precision well Irene is when he he wanted to emphasize um how his teaching of the godhead focused on how God reveals himself to man over time and that's really how the Jews knew God that's how the Jews talked about God how God made himself known and it was all about how God was armenius called it recapitulation putting putting the right head back on the back on the body putting the right headship on everything and restoring that that was the idea how it was all God the godhead was revealed now God brought salvation back to man and that that's a very Jewish way of of looking at a very biblical way of looking at it so brother Braham says he he teaches a Biblical concept of the god and he's and he's right on there and in the true in the revelation of Jesus Christ series brother Branham quotes from him and it's in the middle of Page Three but he he he he lists a bunch of titles of God but he says all these titles are summed up into one name under one God they're only titles of what he was there's just one God and his and his name is one so I didn't want to belabor um these historical or documental points but I think it's really neat because if we Trace our spiritual genealogy back it runs right through irenius and what brother Branham taught was taught by Paul or by arenius but after then it starts getting fuzzy sometimes because Antichrist has gone so far in that everybody almost was teaching the Trinity everybody was even people who God was using to restore certain things but you can go back Paul thought Paul taught in a certain way Irene is taught it the same way and that has been restored you see because Malachi 4 talks about how there's going to be a restoration of the faith of uh of of the fathers of the church fathers to the children living today that's promised a restoration of that faith and we can go back and see what was that faith that Paul had the other Church fathers had and that's what's been restored which to me gives me even greater value for what we have well irenius wasn't just a teacher he was also a pastor we're going to take a look in just a minute to this message to the church in Smyrna in Revelation chapter 2. his um his church was in Leon France at that time there was no France the Roman Empire it conquered part of a Gaul there and that um one of the the city lagun dunum with the yellow rectangle around it that is what was modern day Leon and the people of Lyon they uh they these These are pagans and they don't appreciate the Christians that are there because the Christians don't participate in the Pagan Feasts the first Christians were actually called atheists because the Christians only believed in one God they didn't believe in all the other gods so Christians were atheists because they don't believe in all the other gods um and there was one season where in this portion of Gaul there was a bad Harvest and these uh Pagan peoples around the area they started trying to find what could be the reason for the bad Harvest and maybe it's these folks these strange people different people they don't worship Our God they don't offer the sacrifices maybe they're the reason and once it came time for this particular Festival um this this was the the people had convinced the Pagan to convince themselves that the reasons for this drought it's because the gods are furious with these folks these Christians who aren't worshiping them and these long-existing prejudices escalate into a full-scale riot the Pagan residents assaulted Christians dragging them to the Public Square Christians were condemned they were executed in the public Arena the current Bishop of Leon his name was potenus he died in prison and irenius was a way traveling when this tragedy occurred and he hears about it and afterwards he goes he goes back and he becomes the pastor of Leon and here's what one writer talks about mentions is when he returned the questions facing him were urgent and complex while the faith of some of the survivors had been strengthened through the persecution many others were wearied by the struggle the taunts of their fellow citizens questioning where their God was we're still fresh and this he's got to deal with the very real questions of suffering we believe that Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever we believe that the God who protected his people back in the Old Testament is the same God today but for some reason my fellow Believers my friends got killed in that Riot and I'm left where was God that's a very suffering is a very real question and he's called to handle that and then we all know where we all we all go through the suffering of some kind or other and it's very it's very tempting to listen to The Voice the devil asking where was your God just now where was he what did you do wrong you've been abandoned all those questions are are competing for air time in our mind and that's the situation that Arenas came back to he was not only writing against the gnostics as as a teacher he wasn't living in some Ivory Tower doing that he was getting his feet dirty his hands are there on the ground trying to trying to comfort grieving grieving hearts but if we look at Revelation chapter chapter 2 and we'll see um well it's interesting as as Christ begins to speak to this smyrnian church how he begins he says unto the angel of the church in Smyrna right these things Seth the first and the last which was dead and is alive and I've mentioned before how Christ introduces himself to each age he's he's emphasizing attributes of himself that that particular age is going to need and here you have the first and the last I'm I I started I ended the devil might think he has the last word but he doesn't I'm the first I'm the last later in the letter cnha identifies itself as the amen he has the last word the devil thinks is but but he doesn't so in our trials also in this middle part as we're going through the trials we think the devil's got the last word that we're not going to see the light of day ever again but Christ promises I am the last I will get you through and you'll make it through he who was dead and is alive if anybody has suffered it was Christ and Christ is coming not as one who was alive and is dead that's the usual the little way of things but he was dead and is alive he's come through the suffering he's shown that going through suffering you you you you you win character you and then you receive Glory suffering in glory suffering character and Glory are inseparably linked you cannot get character without suffering you cannot get Glory that lasts without suffering the devil does everything he can in this life to give you a sense of Glory and you can think about what does a what does a nice computer game where you're you're you're you're trying to battle uh I'm trying I like I like strategy games my son plays one every now and sometimes I'll do something with them too I want to conquer the goals with my ancient Roman I I finally win I've got yes I won the battle I feel this glorious sense all these endorphins are just rushing through me I've I've I've won the battle but that is a pretty cheap version of Victory and Glory that the screen goes hurray hurray you won 840 points in Europe this number on on the record it's it's a pretty cheap version of Glory to what God promises when you really get out and go through a real trial and you really push on through then you get character you can have the luxury to restart anything you just press on press on press on you win a great you you win true character and you get an everlasting Glory this glory on the computer screen is going to fade away they make sure it does you have to come back for the next endorphin rush and the next it's going to fade away but the glory that that you win by overcoming trial overcoming sin that's an everlasting Glory it's not going to fade away and it's not going to crash it's not going to lose your the archive of all your victories it's always there you have a name you have your place reserved in heaven Christ keeps a record of all those victories that will never be wiped out no computer crash can take the place of it he introduces himself though I'm the first and the last who was dead and is alive I came through it and I am here with you to make sure that you come through it too because Christ in chapter one he shows John this vision of this of this golden lamp stand John looks at it and he sees the one walking through it who's likely to the son of man Christ is with the church walking through the golden Lampkin not just in the past in Ephesus or in Smyrna but still today when there's so much darkness in the church there's it's all Darkness but Christ is still here to make sure that we can also win our Crown of Glory so the question of suffering the first thing he says I I I know I've been through it as well but I also I know what you're going through I know your works and your tribulation and your poverty and here brother Ben emphasizes these folks they're they're at the bottom levels of society most of the Christians in the early church were slaves most of them were slaves they had material poverty no material wealth at all they weren't living for that they had a completely different value system it was oriented toward Eternal rewards that's why he says I know you're poverty I know the difficulty it is to make ends meet and everything like that I know your poverty but you know what really you're rich really you're rich and it can get so easy to get caught up in the rat race of everyday life thing I've got to have the best this the best this the best this but you know what the greatest riches are going to be the Eternal riches it doesn't mean we have to sell our houses and live in tents in the backyard and and really rough it we don't have to do that but where is our Focus what are we working towards I know the blasphemy of them would say they are Jews and are not by the synagogue of Satan here they're they're they're they're saying they're Jews they're saying that we really know what the the truth is um but they're not they're they're not uh they don't have the truth or the synagogue of Satan the ones who really have the truth are the ones who are following me and then he says uh fear none of these those things that you will suffer the devil shall cast of you into prison that you may be tried and ye shall have tribulation ten days where the Brahman Associates this with the 10-year persecution by emperor Diocletian but I will give you a but be thou Faith one to death and I will give you a Crown of Life with suffering there will always be glory linked you can't have that Crown of Life without first going through suffering there is no shortcut the devil will give you all kinds of options to have an easier way there is no easier way not at all he did it happen here let him hear what the spirit says to the churches Heath to overcometh will not be heard of the second death there's one theme that runs through this message to the Church of Smyrna and that suffering it's tribulation it's all there and um brother Bram says it's not just Smyrna that's for every age but I just want to take a look at this at this question that the people of Leon were struggling with after all of their after many of their brothers and sisters had been hauled away their pastor potennis had had died in jail I think where is God and the and this is uh have to stop and give us ask this question this is this is a classic question people ask how can God be both loving and Powerful if he permits so much suffering because yes we believe in a God who does love us we believe in a God who is powerful and if he were so powerful couldn't he stop the suffering but he doesn't he says the sufferings for our Goods I'm doing it because I love you but how can you have both of these and that's very hard to reconcile they kind of um make the argument like this say a uh a loving person won't permit others to suffer that's that's kind of the first step in that thinking and then but God does permit suffering so if a loving person has a friend others to suffer and God does promote suffering the conclusion then is that God must not be a loving person that's that's the that's the mental trap that runs in but in this critique in this deductive reasoning the only way to stop a deductive argument is to look at the assumptions are the assumptions right here the Assumption as a loving person won't permit others to suffer is that is that true is it true that a loving person would never purposefully inflict pain on another person the other assumption is that good feelings are one of the surest indicators of someone's love they can accompany it but is that the surest indicator and we have to have to agree if there's a God which I believe there is but his ability to understand and comprehend the purpose of things are much higher than mine because God's thoughts are not my thoughts his ways are higher than my ways and I just thought an example like this little child with lots of cavities eating a root canal or something is this child having a pleasant experience in the dentist's chair is there a loving parent who is willfully allowing a dentist to inflict some pain on his child he is could you say then that this parent is unloving no you couldn't and I can I kind of thought of this when my wife took job to the dentist for the first time in Holland he said he lay on the chair pretty willingly and that that went just fine but as soon as he got off the chair and then watched Mama lie on the chair it must have been a terrible experience for my wife I think it was a once in a lifetime but as soon as the dinner started working on her teeth he just screaming in this office what is the dentist doing to my mom it was a it was she it was I mean I think he really worked very fast to get it done but the kid has no idea what's actually going on and that's kind of like us compared to God we've got peanut brains we can't comprehend what is the purpose of me being in this dentist chair what's the purpose of my mom being in this in this chair what's this guy who's prod this this hurts the pain that I'm experiencing now and the here and now I I know it that is much greater than anything that might come in the future that this could be good for we can't understand why God does things and and the moment that we go through them just like the kid I can convince this kid you've got to go to the dentist you've got to you've got to let them pull this tooth I know it hurts I know you're scared but you've got I love you honey I'll hold your hand while he's doing it I will do it but it's for your good no this is not for me for my God I wanna I wanna I want sweet mama kid'll say and that's what we that's how we react in our trials when we don't understand say God I've got to understand before I ever get in that dentist chair I've got to understand why before I ever accept my trial well we've got that kind of idea we're like this little bratty kid but we just have to trust God the only way we can we have to cheat he is a loving heavenly father I don't understand it now but I will stay in this dentist chair as long as it takes or because I believe that if it doesn't if you don't take this tooth out it's going to hurt a lot worse later so there I asked the question is there a scenario where loving parents might allow their children to experience pain there are some scenarios we have one of them there are there scenarios where a loving God might allow us to experience pain too there are will we understand all of them no now this kid might grow up and years later think yeah it really was for my good that mom did that I wish it could have been other way but it was for my good it might take a few years for that child to come to that mature assessment and it might take oftentimes it takes us many years before we can look back to yeah God really did mean it for my best and I'll accept it it does happen that way but will it happen that way in every single thing probably not we always we continue to trust the Lord and He Who has been good with good for me in the past will be good for me in the present I will trust him tomorrow that's all I can do and there are many aspects to pain and suffering I'm just looking at one of them right now but I hope we can see that suffering is can be for a purpose and we and as Christians we can trust that God has all things under control there's no other way to live our lives it's true we can look back and see that what is the basis for um the the basis for knowing um that God loves us it's not uh the loving feelings though we have those sometimes but brother Branham says the basis of God's love is election that God chose us um in the church age book The Lord God Almighty says I know we I I know you were crying there in the dentist chair I was holding you you might not have real you might not have always uh you might you might not remember it now you might remember only the tears and the screaming but I was there holding your hand too you didn't realize all you could feel was the pain of the moment that kids only screaming but mama was right there with you God's right there with us do we might always we might not always see it because we're so focused on the pain we're going through but God's with us and he will never leave us nor for sagas and oftentimes later on God will let us look back and then he'll open our eyes so that we can see that he was there with us and then that brings a healing and the rest and oh if we could just live our lives trusting him because when we don't when we don't see that he's there and we accept the devil's life that he's not there then we're experiencing a double pain we're experiencing the pain of the trial then the emotional pain that God's rejected me I'm abandoned so the trial is something that God puts in their lives but when we forget that he's there with us when he speaks to Smyrna this church and tribulation he says I'm here I'm the first and the last he that was dead and is alive I'm with you fear not he should I I'm right there but if the devil can get our eyes off of God and just on our trial we don't have just the pain of the trial we have this deep sharp pain in the heart God's not that's a lie though because he is with you but you're you're choosing them to accept the belief this as he's not and then when you do that when we do that our pain increases exponentially where does that pain come from we blame that pain on God but that pain comes from Satan because he's getting us to believe a lie but the Lord God says I know there he is walking in the midst of his people but does he hold back the persecution does he stem the tide of trivia does he stem the tribulation no he does not he simply says I know your tribulation I know everything I know every ounce of pain you're going through I've been there I've been through that what a stumbling block this is to many people even still today like Israel they wonder if God really loves them how can God be just and loving if he stands by watches his people suffer and um at this point he quotes from Malachi chapter 1 where the burden of the word of the Lord Israel by Malachi I have loved you saith the Lord yet the people of Israel say how if you loved us you got to be kidding me you say you love this baloney how have you loved us God and God's responses wasn't Esau Jacob's brother said the Lord yet I love Jacob I didn't choose he so I hate to do so I laid his Mountain his Heritage waste for the dragons of the Wilderness where is Esau's people today where's Jerusalem you guys just rebuilt your temple walls groups are are all are all rebuilt as well that's a sign of my love I chose you I am faithful where is Esau today he's not there my love is elective you see they could not figure out God's love they thought that love meant no suffering like a lot of us we really want to believe that they thought that they thought that love meant a baby with parental care it's okay but God wants to bring us from a baby to letting this kid walk sometimes when the kid learns to walk fall flat on their face all kinds of uh scuffed up knees scuffed up arms broken bones why because they've got to learn to do things on their own so they can be building strength and endurance and that's a it's a mom and dad who love their kids enough let them get scuffed up still be able to live their lives later God said his love was elective love the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit to just suffering as a job that's his prerogative he's Sovereign but it is all with a purpose all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose and he would be the author of frustration and not not of Peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect established strengthened settled that's his purpose and the purposes of God will not be defeated they will not and then I just want to go through a series of scriptures brother Brandon quotes these in the church age book but they just show how strongly linked suffering character and Glory are you they can't be separated and Jesus learned obedience by the things which he suffered and we we acquire we acquire character we gain character by the things that we suffer we learn to be obedient to God by the things that we suffer not like this First Peter 1 6 and 7. there's a key phrase if need be you greatly Rejoice now in all the blessings of God that was described in the previous verse though now for a season if need be you're in heaviness through manifold temptations that means if you're going through manifold Temptations only because God said it's needed he's not going to do unnecessary he's not he's not a god of unnecessary suffering he's not a massive because he's not going to be making a suffer just because he likes to see us suffer no he only will only go through trials Temptations and tribulations if need be he's not going to waste suffering it's only if there's a purpose and look at what's on the other end of that suffering that the trial of your faith being much more precious and of gold that perisheth they'll be Tried by a fire might be found in the praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ it's there I just kind of think people are an entrepreneur is willing to go through a lot of pain and suffering it's not easy establishing your own business we've got some people who've established their own businesses here probably it's not easy it's people I want to try it most of these businesses fail within a couple years it's not easy they go if you listen to them talk to why would anybody want to have their own business it's a lot of hard work but why do they do it because of the hope of of being incredibly successful later and it's kind of like why do we go through this why are we willing to go through all these spiritual tribulations and suffering because there is a hope of a great reward that won't fade away that entrepreneurs is going to do is going to it's going to do a lot of really hard work that a lot of people choose not to do because they don't trust Social Security they won't have an a retirement that fateth not away and the Christian we're willing to go through suffering because we want a retirement that's out of this world that isn't ever going to be affected by any economic downturn that's why we that's why we do it but God only brings these on their life if need be right and I like how Peter engages with our reluctance to allow suffering into our thoughts his beloved think it not strange considering the fiery trial which is to try you I think fiery trial this is not this is not what I expected in my day this is a strange thing fire no no fire trials that's just that's the run of the mill that's what happens every day don't think it's strange if you've got fiery trials he's telling us that don't think it's strange as though some strange thing happened to you no fiery trials that's just all the day's work for a Son of God don't think it's a strange thing but instead rejoice in as much as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings but we're going through a hard time we are do we're going to the same experience as Christ we've got our shoulder to the wheel and he's got his shoulder to the wheel with us we're going to the very same things as Christ did that when his glory shall be revealed you may also be glad that exceeding Joy because you will be if you share in the suffering you'll share in the glory think about the old Fable The Little Red Hen how many animals in the barnyard are willing to share in the suffering no they weren't but they all wanted to share and the uh and the cornbread that was made the other day we all want to get we're all like those animals in the Barnard none of us want to be cooking and working throughout the day we don't go through the suffering but we all want the reward at the end but like what Peter says don't think it's strange no fiery trials Open Your Door you see those Devils right out there no all the days work go right at it that's what he says my brother encountered all joy when he followed the diverse Temptations a long time ago there was an Adventure in Odyssey that had this theme of counted all joy and I remember one of the characters Connie Kendall took it to heart whenever anybody had a hard time and said well count it all joy and my brother listen to that session of all this and he really took it to heart and he said it's something bad happened gathered all joy rap counted all joy mom and that got really old fast people say count it all joy the alarm goes off all capital Joy um yeah got to take this with a grain of salt Rejoice is them to do rejoice and weep with them that weep and all things we're going to count it all joy because when you follow the diverse Temptations do count it all joy knowing this at the trying of your faith worketh patience it's like we know it here we don't really always feel it is going to work patience patience is a good thing patients bring character character allows me to be a partaker of Christ Glory we're going to go on through here but let patients have her perfect work that you may be perfect an entire wanting nothing and here's where you kind of get in the thing let patients have her perfect work okay I can get my and get myself up for the trial I can convince myself yes I got to get in the dental chair I'll go ahead and do it but we got to stay we have to stay in the dental chair until God says we're done it's the hard part I can go to a I can go to a convention and get oh I can get I can get in the atmosphere I can get in this verse say yes this trial is God's will for my life and I'm going to let him have his way by Praise the Lord amen let him have his way so I get back I sit back down and I'm going to accept this trial it's not a strange thing I'm an accountant Joy I'll do I'll let the dentist have his way but then I said I want to jump right out of the chair because let patience have her perfect work don't jump out of don't jump off God's offering operating table until he says you're done otherwise you're just going to prolong the agony prolong the pain don't jump off God's table until he's done with you Romans 8 17-18 and if children then heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ if so be that if so be that we suffer with them that we may be also glorified together this Band of Brothers that we we hear about from World War II they're Band of Brothers they went through all the suffering together you know what we when we're when we press through trials with the Lord we're a Band of Brothers also one of our brothers is Jesus Christ he's with us also for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US you can't even put our trials and God's glory in the same sentence they're not even worthy to be put side by side will we talk about our trials they're on the other side I don't know we might think what is there even to talk about I don't care about that anymore I want to talk about what the glory of God's here and he's going to be such an amazing thing to look at Revelation 21 he wipes all tears from their eyes they never think back don't even remember it because it's not even worthy to be what are we talking about it's like after you've had an argument with somebody then you've and then you've apologized you made everything good I'm not talking about that anymore because it's not it's not worthy to compare with the Oneness and the joy and the unity that we feel now it's all passed away it's in in the sea of God's fear and get for us and that sea of God's forgive us is sometimes for us right now it's kind of an abstract concept we we want it to exist we want to have that but we still have the thoughts when we're on the other side it's gone we don't we don't want to go back to it even the best things of this life are nothing compared to the next life and you know what the challenge is to live our life that way it really is does he love us oh yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so he said so that's all the proof We need he said so of course there's somebody else who's trying to get us to tune into His Radio dial he's always saying no he doesn't no he doesn't no he doesn't who are we going to listen to who are we going to listen to if we listen to to Satan our our pain is going to increase exponentially because he's the one who brings this feeling of Abandonment and rejection that is not true but brings the pain but just remember he said so he said so I'm going to hold fast to that he said so and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of the spirit placing us as Sons I used to encourage you brothers and sisters never forget your own testimony don't stop telling your own testimony because as soon as what is the most commonly story told in the Bible it's a story about the children of Israel going out of Egypt again and again and again and again and again why so they would never forget it it's the that establishes them as being God's choice you guys were slaves in Egypt nothing desirable about you but I went and plucked you out and I chose you and let all those Egyptians just drown to the Sea that's evidence of God's love it says how shall I he manifests that he did love us go back and look if you're wondering does God love me what has God done for you in your life has he has he started to work in you have you ever heard God's voice if he has the scripture from Philippians says he who has begun a good work in you he's not going to leave it halfway finished he will finish it God does love you because he started the work God doesn't start to work with somebody he hasn't chosen if he started the work you're chosen and keep on going as though you are the devil wants you to you're the chosen the devil might believe it more than you do and he wants you to forget it so you go through life just all so defeated so defeated no you are chosen stand up like a strong sin of God and press forward because you are chosen God does love us and how can we prove our love to him by believing what he said not by being the perfect Christian not by doing all these good works just believe what I said and go forward conducting yourself with joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom allow us to come to pass this is deserving of the refrigerator by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials when we can conduct ourselves with joy in its trials that is so much easier said than done but when we can do that we're showing our trust in them we're showing our love in them and we're also showing that he's sustaining us because we can't do that on our own I just wanted to spend my last uh 10 minutes or so um kind of looking at why God show revealed himself to Smyrna first as they go through their trials he shows himself as I'm the god who's with you in the trial I'm the first the last he was dead and is alive the pain we experience like I said the pain we experience in Trials is increased when we believe the devil's lies about our sufferings and then Congress that we experience comfort in Trials when we believe the truth or actually and we are able then to go conducting ourselves with joy as we believe the truth now we may think that events in our lives adversity directly determines what consequences we suffer we look back to because this happened to me that's why I am today this adverse situation that came up that's what the problem is that's what caused this thing in my life and when we think this way we're put all the blame right back there and we're just everything happened to me I'm just a passive victim everything just happened to me but this isn't true um there's one if you ask a kindergartner he'll say hey hold up you never get from a to c without something in between it never gets from point A to point C without a point B in between and the point B is our beliefs and um there's a psychologist named Albert Ellis he has this ABC theory of emotional pain it says adversity never leads directly to consequences though we think they do come between the A and the C are beliefs good true beliefs and belief is only good if it's true good true beliefs make you strong bad false beliefs are a poison that slowly kill you so if you have this adverse she's like man this adversity came because everybody was just against me I'm a victim that is a bad false belief that's going to poison you we think so the adversity comes and then we're presented what are we going to do with this because as we as you're in the moment and people who watch someone else go through trials they can see there are multi there are different ways this person can take what choices are they going to make when we make the wrong choice we look back as though this was the only choice I could take but if you're in the moment someone's looking after no they had options it's not just one con there are there are options here what determines the path that we take is the beliefs about the adversity that comes upon us um when we accept false beliefs to our questions about our trials and suffering our suffering multiplies exponential on an emotional level and doctors do acknowledge that emotional pain can be the worst kind of personal suffering that can be worse than the actual physical pain that you have and a lot of physical pain is actually rooted in internal emotional factors someone's bitter about things to happen to them they're gonna have a lot more physical problems in their life doctors say between 75 and 90 of all illnesses can be traced back to the body's response to not germs but distress so emotion have has a strong impact on our organism and I'd say the majority of emotional pain arises from mistaken or irrational beliefs that we hold about things that happen to us and God reveals himself to Smyrna saying I'm right here I'm at the head of it all I'm the first I'm the last I'm right here with you in between fear not accept my thoughts my truth about the tribulation you're going through except that because if you accept that and keep your eyes on me you're going to make it through he knows how the devil's going to work if the devil's going to come on say this this is going on and then as you if you accept that it can be a much harder road to go which belief are we going to take that we the different beliefs we can take that'll determine the consequences we have and I just wanted to um as I thought I read about this this past summer and I got to thinking about what brother Branham called his greatest Temptation and this is when his um he's at the bedside of his dying daughter Sharon Rose this is the hardest moment of my life at the bottom of page five I just kind of summarize I just put a bunch of the questions that he says the devil brought to his mind he says as I'm as I'm there at Sharon Rose's bedside trying to whisk away the flies that are trying to get get your eyes and everything the things that he has just had happened in his life I think his dad passed away his brother he's had a very very difficult time and he says then Satan moved up by the side of me there and said did you say he was a good God did you say he was a Healer then why did your father Die In Your Arms and why did your brothers and why and why did your brother die and your other brother's arms and you were standing in the Pulpit preaching a few weeks ago why didn't he answer you you prayed for these things why didn't he answer you you said he loved you and saved you and you just prayed just a minute ago and God pulls this sheet down and said shut up he won't hear you at all he turned his back on you he's a good god huh he loves you brother Brahms he's he's he's getting he's being by raged with all these thoughts what thought this is the adversity he's got this bad situation his wife's passed away I believe his daughter is now passing away what is he gonna what belief is he going to adopt about this is he going to say God's a bad God how could they ever serve him it's a waste of my time he's taken my wife my daughter my dad my brother and I have served him for nothing if he didn't Embrace that belief how would history have been different he had options but he doesn't everything the devil was telling me was the truth every the devil was taught all these things really happened it's the interpretation that's false everything that he would say it just fell right in line see here I was just about ready to say then if that's the way he's going to act then I won't serve him he was just about there and just as I said that there was something came from somewhere else way down on the inside said who are you to begin with the lord gave the Lord's taken away he said that's the inside man that doesn't reasonable I looked back and I thought how did I get on Earth I came from a bunch of drunkards how did I get here who gave me life how did I even get to this place my brothers were dead but I'm not there is goodness in my life why is God even given me life he has done so much for me the devil doesn't want you to think about your testimony but that's the very thing you need to think about when the Devil Comes tempting you how do they get on Earth I came for a bunch of drunkards how did I get here who give me life who give me that wife who gave me that baby where'd my wife come from my life come from I said no though he slay me I'll trust him get away from me Satan and so he has the adversity but the adversity does not determine our consequence it is the belief will it is not it is the truth that sets us free it's not it's not the not not our interpretations our explanations of how things happen that doesn't set us three those usually bind us and increase our pain but it's the truth that sets us free and brother Branham chose to believe the truth and he made it to the trial and he was an overcomer and we're all Overcomers partly because of that yeah what would have been the ramifications if brother Brandon had accepted the devil's lies about his sufferings did God have a purpose at that moment that his servant wasn't even capable of understanding we can look back and say yeah God had a purpose there at that moment brother Brandon had a really hard time with that just like the little kid in the dentist chair how can Mom letting this happen to me what's the purpose of this Satan's aim is to get us to accept his thoughts and when he does that we accept conclusions about people situations we accept his thoughts about God we accept his thoughts about ourselves and as we let those thoughts take root in our mind we gradually build complexes where do complexes come from they come from accepting the devil's thoughts about things and embracing them and that colors our world and we think this is the way world is we take the devil's glass and we look at and it's a it's a tented world it's a skewed World anybody who says anything different I don't want them in my world we separate ourselves from it but those complexes the uh we we might think they're right but they only separate us to become a prison only the truth sets us free and uh just in in closing here musicians you can you can come the the church at Smyrna teaches us an important lesson on suffering and so some of each one of these Church ages here in the coming uh coming uh coming chapters is going to need how do we go through suffering like this well rest assured that he knows Christ knows he understands and he can say fear not because he knows that he's with us that's why Christ introduces himself in such a personal way this church is going to suffer immensely but they trust him and as they trust and they'll experience extraordinary comfort and there's an extraordinary reward and just two sentences uh from the last quote on page six or a couple sentences often we think it would be almost impossible to be a martyr how many thought of that I hope we don't get persecuted too much I don't know if I could do it um that's a real thought but we think it would almost be impossible to be a martyr brother Brandon writes it but dare to recall that the faith we daily use to Triumph in Christ Jesus is the same faith that upholds the polycarps and all the martyrs the Supreme faith will give Supreme Grace for the Supreme hour rest and that however comes he'll give you the faith he'll give you the grace to make it through then fight today's battle now don't fight tomorrows and then that last uh last three lines all too little time it's been on laboring for the return of rewards of God we spend too much time being consumed by the things today the recompense of God the glory of God is too lightly esteemed if we believe in the reality of the resurrection of the body and the in Eternal Kingdom of substance if we believe in those things that we ought to lay up in heaven those good Treasures that are available to the faithful Saints the bank accounts in heaven are much more important than bank accounts here on here on Earth and that is one of the big lessons that God teaches at the church in Smyrna and hopefully um they'll teach us that today as well amen let's pray and then whatever you're getting afterwards that's heavenly father I thank you for your goodness and Grace Jewish Lord I pray that you would help us to conduct ourselves with joy in the trials that we have day by day oh it can be so hard I pray the Lord you would anoint our eyes with isaf that we can see and even see your hand and look back on the some of the most painful and difficult times in our life that we might be able to see that yes that that memory we talked about the dentist chair was so bad I I blocked out anything except the pain but yeah now that I see Lord you were there holding my hand too and we did make it through I pray that we would see and feel your love in those moments that we've completely been blinded to Lord I pray that you would help us to walk with you Faithfully day by day Lord I just pray that you would make us uh make us Overcomers of God help us Lord not to not to take the the cheap counterfeits that the devil offers of that that eternal glory oh he gives also many of those counterfeits that try to give us as a temporary rush or temporary satisfaction but Lord help us to engage the Battle For Real the fight that we may win that we may overcome and get the Victor's Crown on that day and Eternity help us Lord that we can see and anticipate that moment Lord when you come again and we're there with all of our brothers and sisters Lord we may fight we may Reign and sit with you and Lord I prayed you strength and encourage you to whether my brothers and sisters Lord blessed in my prayer in Jesus name amen
