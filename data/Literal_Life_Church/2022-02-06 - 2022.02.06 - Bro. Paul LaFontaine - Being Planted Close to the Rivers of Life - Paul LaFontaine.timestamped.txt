[0:00] psalms 1 1-3 this morning as we talk
[0:03] about verse 3 a little bit
[0:05] and may the lord bless and anoint his
[0:07] word for our lives this morning each of
[0:08] us have needs each of us have places
[0:11] that we're in in our in our walk with
[0:13] the lord
[0:14] and god is sensitive to where
[0:16] we're at and has the word to be able to
[0:18] take us on to know him in a deeper way
[0:21] so we're thankful for that we trust in
[0:23] that
[0:24] and uh i love him so much this morning i
[0:26] appreciate his grace in our lives
[0:28] amen psalms chapter 1 and verse 1
[0:31] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[0:33] the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth
[0:36] in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the
[0:39] seat of the scornful so this man has
[0:41] distanced himself and and got away from
[0:44] all of these influences and he does it
[0:46] for a purpose and he's blessed by doing
[0:47] it he moves himself away from all of
[0:50] these influences intentionally and then
[0:53] verse two his delight is in the law of
[0:55] the lord because all of us in life have
[0:57] to have a delight we have to have
[0:58] something that we're passionate about
[1:00] this blessed man his delight is in the
[1:03] word his delight is in the presence of
[1:05] the lord and in his law doth he meditate
[1:08] day and night which we derived our
[1:11] series on our thought life may continue
[1:13] with that a little bit wednesday night
[1:15] but he's he's not just wanting to be in
[1:18] in the word but he's wanting to meditate
[1:20] upon it and he's wanting it to be the
[1:22] dominant thing in his thought life verse
[1:25] 3
[1:26] and he shall be like a tree planted by
[1:29] the rivers of water that bringeth forth
[1:31] fruit in his season
[1:34] his leaf also shall not wither and
[1:37] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper so the
[1:40] very end of this is
[1:42] seeing a believer a blessed man
[1:44] in this position
[1:46] and he is his leave shall not his he
[1:49] shall not wither and whatever he doeth
[1:51] shall prosper
[1:52] that's such a blessing to see
[1:55] this blessed man of god and all of it
[1:58] goes back to where he is planted
[2:02] where he's positioned
[2:04] and this message has taught us that we
[2:06] must be positioned
[2:08] in jesus christ we must find our
[2:10] position in the word of god for the age
[2:13] we live in because there's power in
[2:15] position
[2:16] there's flourishing in our position
[2:19] when we step out of our position that
[2:21] thing that's when things begin to fall
[2:22] apart but being planted and rooted in
[2:25] the right place brings this his leaf
[2:28] shall not die and everything he doeth
[2:31] shall prosper i'll tell you i want to be
[2:33] planted wherever that is at
[2:35] amen heavenly father bless your word
[2:36] today and bless each soul that we have
[2:39] lord not under my care as such but
[2:41] they're under your care every soul
[2:43] that's here every soul that's listening
[2:45] in they're under your care this morning
[2:48] and i pray father you'll just as they're
[2:50] on the potter's wheel that you tenderly
[2:52] with your hands mold them and make them
[2:54] lord into your perfect image and to your
[2:57] likeness lord and each time we meet
[2:59] together your word gives us another step
[3:02] another line upon line another another
[3:04] place that we can look at by revelation
[3:07] and see that's where i want to be that's
[3:08] where i want to walk i pray the word
[3:11] would be encouraging to every heart
[3:13] every age group this morning as we
[3:15] commit this service to you and feel your
[3:17] presences here may you do your work we
[3:19] pray in the name of the lord jesus
[3:21] christ amen and amen i want you to shake
[3:24] somebody's hand before you're seated
[3:25] there and god bless you for coming this
[3:28] morning
[3:29] now we want to take a look at the word
[3:31] of god and take this section here verse
[3:33] 3 and i'd like to title this planted
[3:36] close
[3:37] to the rivers of life
[3:39] being planted very very close to the
[3:41] rivers of life planted close
[3:44] to the rivers of life
[3:47] believers
[3:48] how many know that believers are
[3:50] predestinated
[3:53] we have learned through the word of god
[3:55] and one of the truths that has been
[3:57] restored and the balance of that truth
[3:59] has come to us through the message of
[4:00] the hour and to take us back to biblical
[4:03] truth that believers
[4:05] are predestinated before the foundation
[4:07] of the world and it's not that you just
[4:10] came to an altar one night but god in
[4:12] his mind predestinated all believers he
[4:16] knew what choice would be made and he
[4:18] knew and so thus he predestinated you to
[4:21] be conformed to his image we know that
[4:23] but i want to look at today that they
[4:25] the believers are not only predestinated
[4:28] but believers have a predestinated place
[4:31] where they belong as well
[4:33] not only does god predestinate them but
[4:35] they have a predestinated place where
[4:38] they belong they have a predestinated
[4:40] place that they are planted in every age
[4:43] and god knew in his mind god knew you in
[4:47] his mind and you were what we refer to
[4:50] in the last days you were a seed of god
[4:52] how many knows that the believers are
[4:54] not only predestined but they're a seed
[4:56] of god
[4:57] and this understanding came to us as we
[5:00] realize that jesus towards the end of
[5:02] his ministry began to lay out the truth
[5:04] of the seed doctrine and he began to
[5:06] talk about seeds falling into different
[5:08] places he began to talk lay out this
[5:10] thing and it was towards the end of the
[5:12] prophet's ministry that he began to lay
[5:14] out in 64 and 65 so many themes that
[5:18] talked about that you're a seed of god
[5:20] if you're a son of god you always were
[5:22] before the foundation of the world
[5:24] all of my children were inside of me
[5:26] before i was married but it took the
[5:28] betting ground of marriage for my sons
[5:30] that i can fellowship with my two sons
[5:33] and my two daughters this morning
[5:34] because of the betting ground but they
[5:36] were always inside of me in seed form
[5:41] in cell form can you say man if that is
[5:44] true in the natural that it is certainly
[5:46] true in the spiritual that the reason
[5:48] you can say amen to the word of god
[5:50] today the reason you love him and want
[5:52] to worship him the reason that your
[5:54] heart says amen to the word of god is
[5:56] not because you mechanically or
[5:58] intellectually come up with that
[6:01] something is inside you but it's before
[6:02] the foundation of the world
[6:05] there's no way you could say amen to it
[6:07] or believe it or receive the new birth
[6:09] unless you were there with him from the
[6:11] beginning
[6:12] in his thoughts and so we have this term
[6:15] you're a seed of god if you are a true
[6:17] christian you're you were one in god's
[6:20] mind before you were one of those
[6:22] christians you were one of those
[6:24] believers in god's mind before the world
[6:26] was formed but that seed also if we're a
[6:29] seed of god it also has a place because
[6:32] a seed
[6:33] has to have a place to be planted
[6:37] a seed if we're a seed of god how many
[6:39] would raise your hands i believe i'm a
[6:40] seed of god
[6:41] but a seed has to have a bedding ground
[6:43] a seed has to be planted
[6:45] and
[6:46] so we we see a truth unfolding here not
[6:50] just that we are a seed of god but that
[6:53] a seed has to be planted and he
[6:56] predestinated
[6:58] the hour that we live in the time that
[7:00] you would live in that you would be a
[7:02] seed of god during a certain time and
[7:05] you would be planted in a certain age
[7:07] you could have been born in any age but
[7:09] he predestinated the age that you were
[7:12] born in and you would be planted in that
[7:14] age and not just planted in an age you
[7:16] would be planted in the word that would
[7:18] come forth in that age
[7:21] that's where you would be planted
[7:22] because in the word christ is the word
[7:25] christ is the revealed word of every age
[7:27] and when that word comes forth in that
[7:30] age that's the place that you're planted
[7:32] in
[7:34] so your place is predestinated as well
[7:37] he has a word for every generation
[7:40] he has
[7:41] and if he has a word for every
[7:42] generation your position
[7:44] would be planted in that word there's
[7:46] only one place then
[7:48] that that seed of god
[7:50] can thrive
[7:52] we read about a tree here that's planted
[7:55] in the right place
[7:57] besides the rivers of water
[7:59] and it is only in that predestinated
[8:02] planted place that the seed will grow
[8:06] and the seed will thrive
[8:11] it reminds me of
[8:13] brother brahms saying that israel and he
[8:15] refers to a scripture i can't think of
[8:17] it just now but he refers to israel
[8:18] being planted and being in egypt then
[8:20] god brings them out and brother brahma
[8:22] says israel was a good vine but she was
[8:25] planted in the wrong place in egypt
[8:27] so all the potential of the people of
[8:29] god they were god's people all the
[8:32] potential that laid in you it's all
[8:34] there but israel was planted in the it
[8:36] would never thrive in egypt it would
[8:38] never work in egypt oh but i'm a child
[8:40] of god i'll be i'll be fine here in
[8:42] egypt and actually a lot of them wanted
[8:44] to go back after they come out of it but
[8:46] not true believers joshua and caleb said
[8:48] no i don't belong planted in egypt i
[8:51] don't belong planted back there
[8:53] god gave me a promised land to live in
[8:56] and israel was a good vine but she was
[8:59] planted in the wrong place
[9:01] once she got planted in her
[9:02] predestinated place then she began to
[9:04] thrive
[9:06] and this is true of your life
[9:09] you can be a seed of god but planted in
[9:12] the wrong place
[9:14] that's why we say there are many fine
[9:17] christians and many christians that i
[9:19] believe we never speak against people
[9:21] and what god has in their lives we speak
[9:23] against the systems of denominations but
[9:25] brother brahm says not the people
[9:27] there's good people in there
[9:29] and there actually is some still called
[9:31] to come out of that
[9:33] can you say man i'm speaking to you if
[9:35] you're listening to me there's a call in
[9:36] the end time to come out of her my
[9:38] people to come out of babylon and i say
[9:40] if you hear that voice don't wait any
[9:42] longer come out of that system because
[9:44] you can never thrive spiritually under a
[9:47] system of denomination
[9:50] but the people he says are good people
[9:51] so we never criticize what god's done in
[9:53] their life we never want to do that
[9:55] because some people are just planted in
[9:57] the wrong place
[9:59] might as well go ahead and say it that
[10:01] some people are planted in the wrong
[10:03] church even within our own ranks
[10:06] and they're not thriving
[10:10] because they're planted
[10:11] in the wrong place
[10:13] i don't want to just talk about just
[10:14] churches and what church this is much
[10:16] deeper than just what church you belong
[10:18] to or go to this is being planted in the
[10:20] word of god
[10:24] in the balanced word of god in the full
[10:26] gospel in the full unrestricted gospel
[10:28] with no denominational taints to it
[10:30] that's where a believer belongs you got
[10:33] a message influence but it's still a
[10:34] denominational approach to everything
[10:36] you're not going to thrive in that and
[10:38] if you don't think we have denomination
[10:39] creeping into some messes churches i'm
[10:41] telling you you might as be honest
[10:43] there's some they come from the baptist
[10:45] background and their church has become a
[10:47] message baptist church there's some that
[10:49] come from a pentecostal background and
[10:51] that pentecostal tradition and influence
[10:53] is influencing them that they're a
[10:54] pentecostal message church we are called
[10:57] out of all of those systems to come to
[11:00] the light of this word
[11:03] and we are to die to traditions of
[11:05] pentecost we are to die to traditions of
[11:08] baptists and methodists that tree is to
[11:11] be pruned of all those denominational
[11:13] things
[11:18] there's one place that a seed will throw
[11:20] thrive excuse me revive there's one
[11:23] place a seed will thrive
[11:25] and the scripture tells us it's close to
[11:28] the water
[11:30] now water in the bible represents
[11:34] life
[11:36] water represents life
[11:40] and
[11:41] this tree is planted
[11:43] close
[11:44] to the source of life i want you to
[11:47] notice it's wording now in your bible
[11:50] uh psalms one and three i want you to
[11:52] notice how it's worded if you would it
[11:54] is worded that it says
[11:57] and he shall be like a tree planted
[12:00] by the rivers
[12:01] plural
[12:03] of water
[12:05] singular
[12:07] so though there be
[12:09] many streams and many rivers and brother
[12:12] brown referred to the nine spiritual
[12:13] gifts and he referred to all the
[12:15] different diversity but but you see now
[12:18] it may be many rivers
[12:20] but it's one water
[12:22] it's receiving from one source
[12:25] so don't ever get in your idea that
[12:26] there's a lot of different waters and a
[12:28] lot of different denominations there's a
[12:29] lot of different sources for life there
[12:31] is only one source for life there's only
[12:34] one water it's a singular water can you
[12:37] say amen and though there be many rivers
[12:39] there is one source for spiritual life
[12:42] it's not in any it's not in many sources
[12:45] there's one source for life and that's
[12:47] in the word of god for your age
[12:49] christ the revealed word for the age
[12:52] one source
[12:54] and it doesn't come from other sources
[12:56] god provides in that age one source
[13:01] so
[13:02] this tree is planted close to the source
[13:04] of life a seed of god will never belong
[13:06] in another source but christ the word
[13:08] the word for the age in the word for the
[13:10] age is the source of life his seed will
[13:13] be planted there and that's the only
[13:16] place it can thrive the potentials in a
[13:18] seed will never produce in the wrong
[13:21] atmosphere or the wrong environment
[13:23] never
[13:24] that's why he also predestinated which
[13:26] is i'm what i'm presenting here this
[13:28] morning he also presented he
[13:31] not he not just predestinated the seed
[13:34] but he predestined the right environment
[13:36] in every age for the seed to grow into a
[13:40] tree
[13:42] planted so close to the life source
[13:45] that the roots would go down very very
[13:48] deep see that's what god wants in your
[13:50] life he wants you planted in the right
[13:52] place so that your roots can go way
[13:56] deep deep deep down and grow
[14:00] and this tree is planted so close to the
[14:03] life source that the roots go down
[14:06] and are permanently connected close
[14:10] and are connected to the moisture
[14:13] provided
[14:14] by the water of life
[14:18] now i i'll let you apply that to
[14:20] yourself
[14:22] because we position ourselves
[14:24] we we
[14:26] we make decisions
[14:28] of whether to plant our lives close to
[14:30] this word
[14:32] or far away
[14:35] we make those decisions god provides the
[14:37] place but if you keep bucking up against
[14:40] it you're going to find you're not going
[14:41] to come to your full potential
[14:45] but here's a brother that had been
[14:47] planted
[14:48] close to the source of life and his
[14:51] roots go down deep and it's so connected
[14:54] to the moisture in that water from that
[14:56] river because things grow where the
[14:58] river's flowing
[15:01] oh i want to stay there don't you
[15:04] everything grows where the river flows
[15:07] is the name of the the lyric in the song
[15:09] everything grows where the river flows
[15:12] he's right there and his roots are so
[15:14] close that it's it's it's sucking in the
[15:18] moisture that comes
[15:20] from being close to that river
[15:22] now the prophet goes on to israel
[15:24] complaining
[15:26] when they got away from water in the
[15:27] wilderness and they
[15:29] all of a sudden being out in the desert
[15:31] and he refers to the cactus and plants
[15:33] that are in the desert
[15:34] most of them are all sticky if you get
[15:36] on the ground in the desert he says you
[15:37] get all sticky because they're pokey and
[15:41] and it's because they don't hardly
[15:42] receive any water you see sometimes you
[15:44] take the same plant you put it in a
[15:45] different thing where there's a lot of
[15:46] water that stickiness goes away and then
[15:49] he refers to people becoming murmurs
[15:51] complaining sticky
[15:53] feelings on their shoulders
[16:00] and it's it's a dead giveaway to a
[16:02] person and their attitude and their
[16:03] spirit and how their anger is controlled
[16:06] all those other things it's a dead
[16:08] giveaway to where you've planted
[16:09] yourself spiritually because there's no
[16:11] way you can be sticky like that to
[16:13] everybody and be living close to the
[16:16] waters of life
[16:17] because if you're close to the waters of
[16:19] life it softens you it makes you gentle
[16:22] that's why brother tony i like the
[16:23] scripture excuse me the quote back early
[16:25] on where brother brahma says and i quote
[16:27] it often because it's so simple but it's
[16:29] so profound i'd like to proclaim it in
[16:31] every seminary in this world that's
[16:33] trying to learn the bible he says that
[16:35] the only way to be led by the spirit of
[16:38] god is to be gentle and not to know a
[16:41] whole lot
[16:43] and i'd like to read that in every
[16:44] seminar in this world the only way to be
[16:46] led by the spirit of god is to be gentle
[16:49] and not know a whole lot
[16:52] the waters of life make you softer and
[16:54] gentle
[16:56] without it you get hard
[17:02] all right i'll get back to my notes you
[17:03] know when i walk down there it's going
[17:05] to get more practical it seems like
[17:08] you'll get a lot of amens in that
[17:10] section but you know what
[17:12] you plant yourself by the waters of life
[17:14] it's going to be a different result and
[17:15] your different result in your attitude
[17:16] every day you don't get hard when you're
[17:18] close to the lord when you're close to
[17:21] his waters you don't hold grudges
[17:22] against people for years when you're
[17:24] close to the water you don't keep on
[17:26] with your bitterness when you're close
[17:28] to the water it all gets washed away
[17:38] praise the lord
[17:40] so
[17:42] one thing that i learned in my research
[17:44] here is that there are stages
[17:47] to a seed or should i say there's stages
[17:49] to a tree
[17:50] and because this is referred to a tree
[17:52] and in a minute i'll get to that we are
[17:54] typed the bible as trees that's why
[17:56] david says it
[17:57] you you may be a seed but you see now
[18:00] there are stages to a seed
[18:03] you may be a seed and maybe you have
[18:05] said that i'm a seed of god praise the
[18:07] lord and you've even sung about it in
[18:09] conventions for years i'm a seed of the
[18:11] lord i'm a seed of god but you see now a
[18:14] seed
[18:15] really doesn't bear fruit
[18:18] in seed form
[18:23] so you can sing about and you can
[18:25] proclaim all you want to i'm a seed of
[18:28] god brother praise the lord glory be to
[18:30] god i'm a seed of god
[18:32] why don't we have people rejoicing and
[18:33] saying i'm moving moving beyond i'm a
[18:35] seed of god
[18:37] that i've become a tree
[18:39] planted by the rivers of living water
[18:42] and i can see the fruit bearing in my
[18:44] life
[18:45] let's have a convention about the trees
[18:48] of god
[18:54] praise the lord
[18:56] the seed doesn't bear fruit it it has
[18:59] the potential to
[19:01] all the potential is in it
[19:04] but you see now there are stages to a
[19:07] seed and that's why that's why god not
[19:08] only predestinates the seed but god
[19:12] watches over the seed god cares for the
[19:15] seed there are predestinated
[19:18] stages
[19:19] there are predestinated trials in your
[19:22] life
[19:24] you know we didn't hear that term until
[19:26] we were taught by the prophet that even
[19:28] our trials god allows certain things for
[19:32] a seed of god and they are predestinated
[19:34] trials
[19:36] joseph's brother selling him and putting
[19:37] him in a pit and all that thing that
[19:39] happened it was only at the end that god
[19:41] could look at the he could show him the
[19:43] vision of his life and realize
[19:45] his life was predestinated his position
[19:48] was predestinated but his trials were
[19:51] predestinated as well to get him in that
[19:54] right position
[19:56] somebody say amen this morning
[19:58] that's when we grow up and it wasn't
[20:00] until the end that joseph could say to
[20:02] his brothers you're intending for me to
[20:04] kill you for what you did but i can't do
[20:06] that because i'm standing here with a
[20:08] revelation that the tender hand of
[20:10] jehovah
[20:12] i said the tender hand of jehovah
[20:16] what you did in evil god
[20:18] has worked it out to good
[20:24] so a seed a seed
[20:26] has to be put in a place and cast to
[20:28] come through stages and it is watched
[20:31] over and then it's god's cares for and
[20:34] there's a predestinated place for it to
[20:36] be right in his presence and so now let
[20:39] me just take a little bit of the stages
[20:40] here and in my feeble way i realize i
[20:42] have people in my congregation that
[20:43] plant things and love to plant things
[20:46] and their green thumbs i'm not a green
[20:47] thumb my daughter i bought her a a uh
[20:50] mri i brought her a book for christmas
[20:52] because she wants to do learn more about
[20:53] planning she's really good at it already
[20:55] and so but wait we have experts here in
[20:56] this church and so you can imagine the
[20:58] position i feel in talking about plant
[21:00] life and all these other things
[21:02] but uh you correct me if i'm wrong but a
[21:04] seed a tree seed especially has goes
[21:07] through stages
[21:08] and and the there's a predestinated
[21:10] place for a seed of god to be in the
[21:13] right presence to first be germatized
[21:18] because the first thing that happens to
[21:20] a seed it is germatized
[21:23] and to be dramatized by the holy ghost
[21:26] it's to be put in the right atmosphere
[21:31] and if that seed is not dramatized it's
[21:33] never going to grow it's never going to
[21:34] fulfill anything it's never going to
[21:36] come to its full potential and i'll say
[21:39] that this morning you young people
[21:40] everyone else i don't say it to put
[21:42] pressure on you i say it to make you
[21:43] seek god you can never go anywhere
[21:46] intellectually with this you have to be
[21:48] born again and baptized by the holy
[21:51] ghost there is no psychology that can
[21:54] bring you into an overcoming life it
[21:57] takes a birth and a german tizing of
[22:00] that seed on the inside
[22:03] and that's when you begin to pray god
[22:05] god fill me with the holy ghost
[22:08] i need the holy ghost in my life
[22:10] i need this that i've been feeling all
[22:12] my life i need it to be dramatized
[22:15] and when it's germatized something
[22:16] happens to it and it begins to break out
[22:18] of the seed and it begins to grow from
[22:21] that point on because it's been
[22:23] dramatized from what i've heard there's
[22:25] actually three stages
[22:27] in the being germatized there's three
[22:30] changes to being germatized i didn't
[22:32] realize this and you can read about them
[22:34] but there's three sages and i said
[22:35] that's perfect because he says water
[22:38] blood and spirit is what brings the new
[22:40] birth
[22:43] so a seed has three stages even to the
[22:45] german
[22:46] dermatizing and so now three stages even
[22:49] to be dermatized water blood and spirit
[22:51] we have to be dramatized by the holy
[22:53] ghost the seed has to be germatized
[22:56] we're not interested in a denominational
[22:58] experience we're not interested in a
[23:00] message put it putting on we're not
[23:02] interested in intellectually doing all
[23:04] the right things and wearing all the
[23:06] right clothes intellectually if you do
[23:07] it out of respect i believe god will
[23:09] bless you for it thank you for it
[23:11] because it is god's pattern but we're
[23:13] not interested in you stopping there in
[23:16] just an intellectual receiving of this
[23:18] message coming to church and putting
[23:20] this on because you grew up in it is not
[23:22] what we're interested in there is a
[23:24] dramatizing of the seed that's inside of
[23:27] you that comes by only an experience of
[23:30] the holy ghost in your life dad mom
[23:32] can't give it to you i can't give it to
[23:34] you it's when you begin to get desperate
[23:36] and say god i need this more than
[23:38] anything else in my life
[23:42] it's not just giving your heart to the
[23:43] lord you may do that but this is a new
[23:46] birth
[23:47] that's a change of your desires on the
[23:49] inside but i want you to know about the
[23:50] german germatizing stage
[23:53] that it happens underground
[23:55] we can't see
[23:57] when a seed is germatized
[24:00] so what are all these pentecostal
[24:02] influences that make it such a public
[24:04] show where now sudden we know the person
[24:07] has been baptized by the holy ghost by
[24:09] what we see
[24:10] really in nature you don't see when it's
[24:13] dramatized
[24:15] jesus said he said the war the wind blow
[24:18] it where it listeneth and you hear the
[24:20] sound but you can't tell when it comes
[24:22] and goes so is everyone that's born of
[24:24] the spirit jesus said we don't see this
[24:27] part but when it happens it's real
[24:32] why are we trying to make it such a
[24:34] visible thing is i know that person's
[24:37] been baptized by the holy ghost because
[24:38] they shouted and they danced all over
[24:40] the building we don't know that until we
[24:43] see the fruit that comes from their
[24:44] lives
[24:47] and i believe in shouting i believe in
[24:49] dancing i believe when the spirit comes
[24:51] through i don't think you should sit
[24:52] there like a bump in the log i think the
[24:54] holy spirit makes us cry and weep and
[24:56] worship and open our hearts you do it at
[24:58] a ball game why can't you do it in here
[25:01] i believe in shouting but because a
[25:04] person shouts because the atmosphere is
[25:07] charged with the holy spirit doesn't
[25:09] mean a person's getting a new birth
[25:14] let's see this thing brother tony's
[25:16] underground
[25:18] when the dramatizing of the seed happens
[25:20] it's not visible
[25:26] when god put his seed in mary
[25:30] there was no sensation
[25:33] nobody seen it
[25:36] and yet the son of god
[25:38] was was
[25:40] the cell began forming
[25:42] and nobody's seen it and she didn't feel
[25:44] anything it was the holy ghost without
[25:46] sensation
[25:50] one of the mysteries that's been
[25:52] revealed
[25:53] particularly under the pentecostal
[25:55] traditions
[25:56] one of the mysteries is to receive the
[25:59] holy ghost without a sensation
[26:03] without a feeling
[26:07] we are birthed by the word of god
[26:09] incorruptable
[26:11] not by a feeling not by a sensation
[26:16] not by just the local evangelist that
[26:18] comes through that creates an atmosphere
[26:20] i understand that for a new birth but
[26:23] unless that heart is you you say i need
[26:25] a change
[26:26] there's not much of a change taking
[26:28] place there
[26:30] it says underground the stages that's
[26:32] going on underground and and so so then
[26:35] from that then we find
[26:37] uh
[26:39] then it shoots up
[26:41] the next stage of the seed is it shoots
[26:43] up
[26:45] into a little blade
[26:47] and it's actually called a shoot
[26:50] it's called a chute because it shoots up
[26:52] and it's just a little blade that comes
[26:54] up through the ground
[27:00] amen
[27:03] and so
[27:04] and then when it shoots up and it's a
[27:06] chute then we have
[27:08] what they call a seedling
[27:10] it's not a seed anymore it's a seedling
[27:15] i might start becoming a green thumb
[27:20] ma'am i might be down helping you in the
[27:22] garden this year
[27:25] she's been asking for help for years and
[27:29] now they're done with all that they buy
[27:31] it at the store like me now
[27:34] it's a lot easier
[27:38] a seedling is a very young tree
[27:42] notice it's been germatized
[27:45] but it's a very young tree perhaps one
[27:47] or two years old that has been grown
[27:49] from seed in a tree nursery and
[27:51] transplanted to the area where the new
[27:54] forest will emerge
[27:56] so this is another stage a seedling
[27:58] stage now some some steeds get spread
[28:01] and you know there's different areas
[28:03] where they get spread but in our world
[28:05] and in this generation the seedling is a
[28:07] very young tree and it's it's planted in
[28:10] a in in the environment of a tree
[28:12] nursery and it's tre then it's
[28:13] transplanted to the area where the new
[28:15] forest will emerge seeds serve
[28:18] several function for the plants that
[28:20] produce them key among them of these
[28:23] functions of the of this nursery or this
[28:25] functions of the this this seedling time
[28:29] three key functions nourishment of the
[28:32] embryo
[28:33] dispersal to the new location
[28:36] and dormancy during unfavorable
[28:38] conditions and i want you to notice now
[28:41] dormancy under unfavorable conditions in
[28:44] other words dormancy is is you could
[28:47] reword it like
[28:49] it slows things down a little bit
[28:52] because of the harsh conditions or
[28:54] because unfavorable conditions it wants
[28:57] to ensure that this seed gets a good
[29:00] start and so if there's unfavorable
[29:03] conditions this this is the the work now
[29:06] that takes place a dormancy it may slow
[29:09] things down a little bit because of the
[29:12] conditions but nevertheless we see that
[29:16] this is a stage and so i want to say to
[29:18] you
[29:19] that god in his caring gentle nature
[29:22] especially when a seed has been
[29:24] germatized
[29:26] god the great nursery
[29:29] director is going to watch over this
[29:32] seedling
[29:34] god is going to nourish this seedling
[29:39] the word nourishes in the bible we are
[29:41] to be called to nourish things the
[29:43] husband is supposed to nourish his wife
[29:46] in spiritual things can i get an amen
[29:48] from the brothers
[29:50] nourishing her and cherishing her
[29:54] so in this work god is god is watching
[29:57] over us
[29:58] he knows what we need and even though
[30:01] uh its unfavorable conditions he cared
[30:04] and watched us he nourished us uh show
[30:07] that uh slide of the seedling while i'm
[30:09] talking about it even though there's
[30:11] unfavorable conditions he cares over us
[30:15] he watches over us he nourishes us
[30:18] and the the prophet said we must bear
[30:21] with the weak until they are strong you
[30:24] guys have that seedling picture there
[30:27] he said we must bear with the weak until
[30:29] they are strong now it has all the
[30:31] potential to be strong
[30:33] but there's a process there's a there's
[30:36] stages that it goes through it's not
[30:38] been planted it has been planted but it
[30:41] hasn't been planted in the final
[30:43] predestinated place yet and so because
[30:45] of that we see that it has to be
[30:47] nourished god has to care over it and
[30:49] that's why we have this theme the
[30:51] prophet saying we must bear with the
[30:52] weak until they are strong how many will
[30:56] agree with me that when you start out
[30:58] you have all the potential to be strong
[31:01] but there's a lot of christians that are
[31:03] that are weak and need to become strong
[31:10] then you have the prophet preaching
[31:12] perfect strength
[31:13] through perfect weakness
[31:16] this is a strange title to preach
[31:18] amongst pentecostals because we're
[31:20] always professing pentecost is always
[31:22] professing how strong we are
[31:25] and now i'm going to take a sermon on
[31:27] weakness and show you
[31:28] that when you're weak
[31:31] he becomes stronger
[31:34] that's when we learn our dependence on
[31:36] him
[31:38] that's the truth none of the
[31:40] pentecostals we're talking about
[31:41] strong
[31:43] it's always about the boldness and the
[31:45] davids and i'm i'm not against any of
[31:47] that preaching we need that to build
[31:48] faith but don't ever forget that
[31:50] sometimes in your weaknesses paul sought
[31:53] the lord three times about something and
[31:55] he realized through this weakness god is
[31:58] made stronger
[32:00] god has a strength coming in your life
[32:02] that is something different than the way
[32:03] you see it's going to happen and so even
[32:05] a seed of god is seedling god cares for
[32:08] that because he wants to take it through
[32:09] certain things and there's conditions
[32:11] that would be too harsh to you i
[32:13] couldn't find the scripture last night
[32:14] but there's one place god refers to the
[32:16] children of israel we know for 40 years
[32:17] they were in the wilderness and didn't
[32:19] go in the promised land they could have
[32:20] with him within three days but they
[32:22] stayed there but one reason is not just
[32:24] because they didn't
[32:25] respect the prophet but one place god
[32:28] says god says
[32:30] and i'm just paraphrasing because i
[32:31] couldn't find this christian but it's in
[32:32] there trust me it's in there
[32:35] or i wouldn't be saying this but he
[32:37] referred to them being there and he sent
[32:40] him to an army and they got all down
[32:42] about having to fight this army and as
[32:43] god was saying you're not ready to fight
[32:45] this little army here then you're not
[32:47] ready to go against in the promised land
[32:49] you're not strong enough yet so god in
[32:52] his time was getting used to this stuff
[32:56] so that they could become strong
[32:58] a seedling in this maybe nursery or
[33:01] wherever whatever it is god is watching
[33:04] over it because the conditions sometimes
[33:07] can be a little harsh but he wants to
[33:09] ensure ensure that you begin to get
[33:12] strong truly strong
[33:16] is that okay with everybody
[33:18] how many believe god's watching over
[33:19] your life
[33:21] even though there's unfavorable
[33:22] conditions somebody's had unfavorable
[33:24] conditions to your life
[33:26] how many has wondered whether why why
[33:28] the lord even called you sometimes
[33:30] trials you go through you wonder why the
[33:31] lord he called you but you're still here
[33:33] today and you realize god was watching
[33:35] over you through unfavorable conditions
[33:38] it's like i didn't know how i survived
[33:40] that but i'm here and i survived it by
[33:42] the grace of god
[33:44] because god's watching over his
[33:46] seedlings
[33:48] and so now then a tree
[33:50] i have to move on now then the tree goes
[33:52] from the seedling
[33:53] to the sapling
[33:56] and that's over three foot tall seedling
[33:58] is under three foot tall a sapling is
[34:00] over three feet tall and you see friends
[34:02] i just wanted to get to get to the point
[34:04] there's so much to this and it speaks of
[34:07] a son and daughter of god a seed of god
[34:09] they go through a lot under god's care
[34:13] all the time they're under god's care
[34:15] they go even after they're dermatized
[34:18] they go through stages can you say amen
[34:22] but they're under god's care so many
[34:24] ministers
[34:25] who sometimes speak of the seed of god
[34:29] they're preaching of its potential
[34:32] but quite often we don't hear a lot of
[34:34] preaching about the stages
[34:37] that a seed goes through
[34:40] amen
[34:41] and it's there's not a thing wrong with
[34:43] preaching you into your potential and
[34:46] preaching the potential and the power
[34:48] that lays within you and all the
[34:50] potentials if you're a seed of god you
[34:52] have all the power and potential to
[34:54] become a full-grown uh fruit-bearing
[34:57] tree for god you have all the potential
[34:59] there every apple that a tree will ever
[35:02] produce is in that little seed
[35:04] so we understand that but too often we
[35:07] preach and we preach the potentials of a
[35:09] seed but we don't preach the stages of a
[35:11] seed
[35:14] and so the expectations are way out here
[35:18] and somebody's saying oh and
[35:20] i'll never reach there
[35:24] but if you know you're a seed of god
[35:26] you can say i'm going to reach there
[35:29] i got it within me
[35:31] but lord what do you have to take me
[35:33] through to get me to that place
[35:36] lord i want to be planted by the river
[35:38] permanently the rest of my life
[35:43] what you got to do with me to get me
[35:44] there
[35:46] so so much of this speaks about the sons
[35:48] and daughters of god under god's care
[35:50] all the time so many ministers speaking
[35:52] of these things and i respect all
[35:54] ministries not speaking against anyone
[35:56] but sometimes we miss that it's speaking
[35:58] of the full mature son of god full
[36:01] adopted son of god now
[36:03] and i believe a minister even referred
[36:05] to it being you when you're when you're
[36:07] born again
[36:08] you're a full matured adopted fully
[36:10] matured son of god right then well
[36:12] potentially you are
[36:15] but there the adoption process is that
[36:18] you have the spirit of adoption when
[36:20] you're born again
[36:22] but now you go through a training time
[36:27] till you come to the full spectrum of
[36:30] adoption that's the way i believe it
[36:34] we must see the full potential it's fine
[36:36] to preach that way
[36:37] but we must also see that every seed
[36:39] goes through stages even after it's been
[36:41] germinated seedlings are not bearing a
[36:44] lot of fruit yet how many would agree
[36:46] with me that seedlings are not bearing a
[36:47] lot of fruit yet
[36:49] but it's in them it's in them but
[36:50] they're not bearing a lot of fruit if if
[36:53] none
[36:55] and according to our text god has a
[36:57] place for you to be planted you will
[36:59] never bring forth all that's in you
[37:01] until you have permanent and settled and
[37:03] planted in the right place
[37:06] none of this transplanting and going and
[37:08] moving around from place to place it
[37:11] doesn't work spiritually for a believer
[37:13] he has one place for you to settle down
[37:16] put your roots down be planted by the
[37:18] word of god and stay there for the rest
[37:21] of your life
[37:24] this
[37:24] you know how many has ever had brothers
[37:26] had your wife want you to go move a
[37:28] plant
[37:29] that's here
[37:30] and you're gonna dig it up and some of
[37:32] them are pretty big already but she
[37:33] wants you to dig it up because she
[37:34] thinks it belongs over here
[37:41] and i don't know why she's asking me
[37:43] okay brother mike thank you i feel
[37:45] better two okay there's three fourths oh
[37:48] can i get a witness can i have some more
[37:49] in this
[37:50] oh i feel so much better now i'm going
[37:52] to talk about it
[37:54] this is fine where it's at
[37:57] it's doing good
[38:01] and i'm not experienced enough to know
[38:04] to take this thing out brother tony and
[38:06] make sure that i get enough roots
[38:08] because if you don't get enough roots
[38:10] and you don't get that thing planted
[38:11] right over here
[38:13] that thing is going to die
[38:17] and that's why i'm nervous about doing
[38:18] and i've had some of them die
[38:20] and then i get blamed because they die
[38:23] it's terrible it's not fair
[38:28] but this
[38:29] uprooting i think it needs to be over
[38:31] here and replanted over here
[38:34] and if you did that a lot
[38:37] it gets weaker
[38:39] it's not god's intention for you to be
[38:42] uprooted and replanted and uprooted and
[38:45] replanted and uprooted it's not god's
[38:47] intention for a plant
[38:50] some of them survive some of them don't
[38:56] we're talking about the predestinated
[38:58] plan of god where to be planted
[39:01] he has a place
[39:02] for you his position for you
[39:06] and so
[39:07] when we grow in the lord we realize that
[39:10] he cares for this section but then he
[39:12] moves us on and it's and so that was my
[39:15] my theme to you this morning is that
[39:18] this brother and sister is planted close
[39:20] to the river of water rivers of water
[39:23] and he brings forth his fruit in his
[39:25] season this is all about spiritual man
[39:28] growing under the word of the age and
[39:30] the spirit of the age the holy spirit
[39:32] and
[39:33] growing until you become a fruit can you
[39:36] say amen
[39:37] the more you move it the more the weaker
[39:39] it becomes we don't need a lot of this
[39:42] planting and replanting and moving and
[39:44] uprooting and then planting notice
[39:46] you're not meant to stay
[39:48] a seedling or a sapling can i tell you
[39:50] that this morning you're not meant to
[39:53] say stay a seedling
[39:55] i don't preach i preach adoption i
[39:58] preach we're growing to adoption this is
[40:01] the age to adoption and every person in
[40:03] here and every person listening if
[40:04] you're a believer this is the age of
[40:07] adoption it's not the age to stay in our
[40:09] immaturities and our carnality it's the
[40:11] age to grow to fall matured believers
[40:16] bearing the fruit of this message
[40:18] bearing the fruits of the spirit every
[40:20] day
[40:22] that's why i preached because why you're
[40:23] not meant to stay as a seedling
[40:27] you're not meant to stay and brother
[40:29] branham refers to some places that
[40:31] they're hot bed plants and they have to
[40:33] be babied and pampered how many knows
[40:36] that i believe there's a care that the
[40:37] lord gives in a seedling stage but these
[40:40] hot bed plants he said they have to be
[40:42] pampered and babied and coaxed to come
[40:44] to church and coaxed to do this that's a
[40:47] hotbed plant
[40:48] he said a real thorough bed a real seed
[40:50] of god you put him in the right
[40:52] environment and something's going to
[40:53] come forth
[40:57] babied all the time should i go into it
[41:00] he's just a fat little baby he wants his
[41:02] bodily don't mean maybe
[41:08] wants to be pampered he wants to be
[41:10] coaxed everything careful of their
[41:12] feelings i'm looking for a church that's
[41:14] grown out of having their feelings on
[41:16] their shoulders and coming to church
[41:17] with their carnality and their minds on
[41:19] everybody else and the drama in the
[41:21] church i'm looking for maturity that
[41:23] somebody lays all those thoughts down
[41:24] and says i'm coming today for one reason
[41:27] i need the lord
[41:30] i'm coming to sing my songs and create
[41:33] an atmosphere where somebody can get a
[41:35] new birth
[41:36] somebody can be delivered
[41:40] amen instead of sitting down and say
[41:42] looking around oh yeah i knew that about
[41:44] them oh yeah
[41:46] okay get in come on get me going now
[41:52] got to be babied to come to church got
[41:54] to be cokes along got to walk on pins
[41:57] and needles so get that thing down walk
[42:00] on pins and needles so you don't offend
[42:02] anybody
[42:09] and if you're preaching with the love of
[42:11] god you'll never preach too hard for a
[42:13] seed of god
[42:15] if it's the word and love they want to
[42:16] hear it preach it
[42:20] none of this sugar-coating it and
[42:23] ignoring certain subjects like modesty
[42:25] and he said then
[42:27] if the world the word the lord leads me
[42:29] into a subject i'm going there that's
[42:31] right that's right and thankfully i have
[42:33] some here that said let's go there i'm
[42:35] ready to go with you
[42:36] if it takes the hide off my back let's
[42:38] go there by the holy spirit preach it in
[42:41] love don't come up here unless you've
[42:43] got it full of the love of god but don't
[42:44] ever stop preaching it because you can
[42:47] never preach the seed of god out
[42:49] somewhere to backslide you you can never
[42:51] do that this is the thing they want to
[42:53] hear
[42:54] hallelujah somebody say praise the
[42:56] lord amen and so now we see we notice
[43:00] you're not meant to stay a sibling
[43:02] you're not meant to see a sapling in
[43:04] those places your roots let me see a
[43:06] sapling with a tree it's almost four
[43:08] four three or four feet already and it's
[43:10] in that big canvas and that burlap sack
[43:12] or whatever it is and it's there it's
[43:14] just like you're going that can never
[43:16] reach its full potential it's meant to
[43:18] be planted somewhere and even it's grown
[43:20] up to four feet and it looks like some
[43:22] plants coming out no it's still not
[43:24] planted right
[43:27] it's got the big burlap sack around it
[43:29] and it's there in the nursery still it's
[43:31] like what are you doing still in the
[43:33] nursery
[43:35] you have to take that thing and
[43:38] put it where it's meant to be for the
[43:39] rest of its life
[43:41] to bring forth fruit
[43:44] amen
[43:46] buy that thing and take it
[43:48] plant it in its right way and that's god
[43:50] he doesn't let you sit around the church
[43:52] he wants to keep you as a sapling
[43:56] you say no no now now they're ready i'm
[43:58] going to plant them
[44:00] permanently by the wherevers of water
[44:04] the reason i don't buy those big
[44:05] saplings
[44:07] sometimes i don't get them because
[44:09] i can't afford them
[44:11] once they get that stage they want a lot
[44:13] of money for them
[44:15] but it's because the potential is there
[44:17] it's already you put in the right places
[44:19] seeing these things ready to go
[44:22] oh i love the word don't you
[44:27] i got to finish this up now
[44:30] god wants you to thrive god wants you to
[44:32] produce not a denominational life can

[44:37] message of your day to see the beautiful
[44:38] fruits of the word

[45:34] sideshow

[45:43] expressed to this world all the fruits
[45:45] of jesus christ to be thriving and
[45:48] blooming like this and and fresh and
[45:51] someone can take a bite of your life
[45:54] and the juices of god flow out of your
[45:57] life brother tony
[46:01] drips down your face and

[46:06] this is what it's supposed to look like
[46:08] this is thriving the next one
[46:10] ah
[46:14] man
[46:15] next one
[46:17] ah
[46:18] i'm trying to cover all the bases here
[46:20] this morning
[46:22] it's not what it looks like as a
[46:24] seedling it's not what it looks like
[46:25] when it's germatized
[46:28] that's the potential what it becomes
[46:31] this is your life
[46:32] i don't care if you've been 30 years
[46:34] under the
[46:36] moping under some bitterness
[46:38] you're not meant to stay there
[46:41] is what you're supposed to look like
[46:42] do we have one more
[46:45] we don't that's too bad
[46:49] i'm getting hungry
[46:52] let me know that
[46:53] can you give me about 20 more minutes
[46:55] here
[46:57] how many know that trees in the bible
[46:58] are a type of man
[47:00] and the key scripture we have for that
[47:01] of course is psalms 1.
[47:03] man is typed as a tree like a tree
[47:05] planted by the rivers of water
[47:07] so now if we go back to the garden of
[47:09] eden if you turn to genesis 2 if you go
[47:12] back to the garden of eden you realize
[47:14] that
[47:15] you'll never understand what happens in
[47:18] the garden of eden until you see
[47:22] a tree
[47:24] as a person
[47:26] my denominational friend if you're
[47:28] listening today you'll never understand
[47:29] what happened in the garden unless you
[47:31] understand the symbolism that's in the
[47:34] book of genesis
[47:36] and you understand it not through the
[47:38] lens of your denomination and what
[47:39] you've been taught in sunday school but
[47:41] you understand it through revelation and
[47:43] what it really was because you begin to
[47:44] look at it and you realize if you don't
[47:46] understand that trees represent persons
[47:49] you're not going to understand what
[47:51] happened in the garden
[47:53] and genesis 2 said verse 8 and the lord
[47:55] god planted a garden eastward in eden
[47:58] and so chapter 2 is about the garden now
[48:00] so chapter 1 he's created everything and
[48:02] all these other things but chapter 2 is
[48:04] about a garden
[48:05] chapter two is about a garden
[48:07] if we're in chapter two of the genesis
[48:09] of the beginnings you can pretty much
[48:12] see what's in god's mind that this is
[48:14] about planting a garden and the fruits
[48:16] coming from a garden
[48:18] that's right the lord god planted a
[48:20] garden eastward in eden and there put
[48:22] man whom he had formed and out of the
[48:24] ground made the lord god to grow every
[48:26] tree that is pleasant to the sight
[48:29] and good for food
[48:31] the tree of life also in the midst of
[48:34] the garden and the tree of knowledge of
[48:36] good and evil now it's not me that made
[48:37] a distinction in all the other trees and
[48:39] then he made a distinction of the tree
[48:41] of life and treated all good evil god
[48:42] did that
[48:44] he just made a distinction when he uses
[48:46] the word and also
[48:48] he didn't have to do that he could if
[48:50] they're all literal trees he could have
[48:51] just said well all the trees and they'll
[48:53] all bring forth the fruit but he god
[48:55] made a distinction
[48:57] and if you don't by spiritual revelation
[48:59] catch that listen now he's talking about
[49:01] natural trees but he's also talking
[49:03] about spiritual trees
[49:06] and i'm going to prove this to you here
[49:08] by the bible this morning and and so now
[49:10] the trio life of life also in the midst
[49:12] of the garden and the tree of knowledge
[49:14] good and evil notice the tree of life is
[49:15] in the midst of the garden it's not like
[49:17] the other trees it's in the midst of the
[49:19] garden and the river went also of eden
[49:21] to water the garden here's a river that
[49:23] we're preaching about this morning
[49:24] there's a river that went out of eden to
[49:26] water the garden
[49:30] blessed be the name of the lord
[49:32] it's all there
[49:34] the garden
[49:36] the trees
[49:37] and the river of life
[49:42] river went out of eden to water the
[49:43] garden and thence it was parted and
[49:45] became into four heads then the name of
[49:46] the first with pisces that is which is
[49:48] com compassed at the whole land of have
[49:50] yeah which there is gold so it goes into
[49:52] the names of the the rivers there and
[49:53] then verse 15. and the lord god took the
[49:55] man and put him in the garden of eden to
[49:57] dress it and to keep it and the lord god
[49:58] commanded the man saying of every treat
[50:01] of the garden thou must eat freely eat
[50:03] but of the tree of the knowledge of good
[50:05] and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in
[50:07] that day that thou eat us thereof that
[50:10] thou shalt surely die so that's that's
[50:12] you know if you're looking at literal
[50:14] trees now now wait a minute what's
[50:15] what's going on here what's the
[50:16] distinction because it it it you don't
[50:19] normally normally have that it's just if
[50:21] it's just a literal tree now there's a
[50:22] warning against eating of this
[50:25] you'll die
[50:26] and the lord god said it is not good
[50:28] that man should be alone i will make you
[50:30] help me for him and out of the ground
[50:31] the lord god formed every beast of the
[50:33] field every fowl of the air and brought
[50:35] them unto adam to see what he would call
[50:36] them and whatsoever adam calls every
[50:38] living creature that was the same
[50:39] thereof and adam gave names to all the
[50:41] cattle to the fowl of the air to every
[50:43] beast of the field but for adam there
[50:44] was not found a helpmate for him and the
[50:46] lord god calls us steep sleep to fall
[50:48] upon adam and he slept and he took one
[50:50] of his ribs and closed up the flesh
[50:52] there up so let's not talk about eve
[50:54] although i will say this all right
[50:56] in the same chapter that he talks about
[50:59] the garden
[51:01] literally
[51:02] is the woman
[51:04] coming from the man
[51:06] who is the female part
[51:08] who is the part that will bring forth
[51:11] fruit
[51:13] eve wasn't in the first chapter at least
[51:15] not in this form she's not in the third
[51:17] chapter she's not no when she's formed
[51:19] and god brings this female part she's
[51:22] the one that's going to bring forth
[51:23] fruit
[51:25] that's why brother branham preached the
[51:27] bride tree it's not christ is the tree
[51:29] of life it's not just that but there is
[51:31] a bride tree there's a second eve to
[51:34] come out of adam
[51:37] she's in the second chapter
[51:39] where the garden is
[51:41] oh somebody say praise the lord
[51:44] so for those of you who are listening
[51:46] you want me to prove that these two
[51:48] trees were not literal cheese but
[51:50] they're persons there's a mystery behind
[51:52] it and it's hidden in the parable jesus
[51:54] spoke in parables and if you didn't
[51:55] understand the parable what was behind
[51:57] it you're going to take it all literal a
[51:59] lot of times denominations said take it
[52:00] all literally take a lecture but we're
[52:01] supposed to have a spiritual life but we
[52:03] take everything in genesis and
[52:04] everything literally now you can't do
[52:05] that you have to have a revelation of
[52:07] what god's trying to say and in the
[52:09] garden of eden it's not all literal
[52:11] trees and so the first one he refers to
[52:14] is he says let me just get it now he
[52:16] says but also in the midst of the garden
[52:18] this tree of life now i'm here to
[52:20] present to you that those two trees are
[52:23] persons they're they're they're a being
[52:26] they're the tree of life is a person and
[52:28] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[52:30] is a person
[52:32] i'm going to prove it chapter 3 and
[52:34] verse 8 and they heard the voice of the
[52:36] lord god walking in the garden
[52:39] in the cool of the day really
[52:42] oh
[52:42] there's a voice of god
[52:44] walking in the garden
[52:47] it isn't interesting he says there's a
[52:49] tree of life in the garden and now we
[52:51] have a further intimidation there's a
[52:53] voice of god in the garden
[52:56] so that tree is not a literal tree
[52:59] that's a person that's our lord speaking
[53:02] [Applause]
[53:05] so the tree of life is a person and they
[53:07] heard the voice of god walking in the
[53:08] garden of the cool day and adam and eve
[53:10] hid themselves from the what from the
[53:12] presence of the lord a god among the
[53:15] trees of the garden so among the trees
[53:18] of the garden
[53:20] is this person
[53:22] the tree of life
[53:24] now who's the tree of knowledge gonna be
[53:26] is that a person chapter 3 and verse 1
[53:28] thou the serpent was more subtle than
[53:30] any beast of the field which the lord
[53:31] god hath made and he said unto the woman
[53:34] yea hath god said ye shall not eat of
[53:36] every tree of the garden and the woman
[53:37] said to the serpent we may eat of the
[53:39] tree of the fruit of the trees of the
[53:40] garden but of the fruit of the tree
[53:41] which is in the midst of the garden god
[53:43] has said you shall not eat of it neither
[53:45] shall ye touch it lest ye die and the
[53:47] serpent said unto the woman ye shall not
[53:49] surely die for god doth know that in the
[53:52] day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall
[53:55] be opened and ye shall be god as gods
[53:58] knowing
[54:00] good and evil
[54:02] oh
[54:03] somebody's talking about good and evil
[54:06] and the tree in chapter 2 says it's a
[54:09] tree of knowledge of
[54:11] good and evil
[54:14] and now here's a here's a person talking
[54:17] through the creature of the serpent
[54:21] and what's his message
[54:23] if you take of this
[54:25] you'll know good and evil guess what
[54:28] this is the tree of knowledge of good
[54:30] and evil talking
[54:32] and the scripture
[54:33] bears witness of that
[54:36] that was a little
[54:38] serpent seed 101.
[54:43] amen
[54:45] scripture proves itself friends
[54:48] this is a restored truth
[54:50] in the bible but then eve is in chapter
[54:53] two
[54:54] so the trees are there's a mystery
[54:55] behind the trees but even two and eve
[54:58] has a mystery behind her because she's
[55:00] the mystery of the bride tree
[55:02] that there be a bride tree come out of
[55:04] christ then out of calvary there'll be a
[55:06] bride come out of christ
[55:08] eve was the female part and naturally
[55:11] even eve she's in chapter two naturally
[55:14] what should will she do she will bring
[55:17] forth fruit that will be her purpose
[55:22] it's said of mary
[55:24] i i think her cousin said blessed now
[55:27] blessed art thou among women blessed is
[55:30] the fruit of thy womb
[55:39] to bear fruit
[55:41] naturally
[55:42] but this is speaking of the second eve
[55:44] the bride tree spiritually and what are
[55:45] we supposed to do bear the fruit
[55:49] of christ
[55:52] and then if you jump over here with me
[55:55] to
[55:55] john 15. maybe you guys can bring it up
[55:57] in the back john 15 verse 1.
[55:59] then we're going to read it off the
[56:00] screen john 15 is where jesus picks it
[56:03] up and he says he goes so far as to say
[56:07] i am the true vine and my father is the
[56:10] husband next one
[56:14] every branch in me that beareth not the
[56:17] fruit he taketh away and every branch
[56:19] that bear fruit he purgeth it that it
[56:21] may bring forth more fruit
[56:24] now ye are clean through the word which
[56:25] i've spoken unto you
[56:28] abide in me and i in you and the branch
[56:30] cannot bear fruit of itself except it
[56:33] abide in the vine no more can ye except
[56:36] you abide in me
[56:39] i am the vine
[56:41] ye are the branches
[56:44] the mystery of eve the mystery of the
[56:46] second eve that's why i preached the
[56:47] bride tree can you say amen i'm the vine
[56:50] you're the branches he that abideth in
[56:51] me and i in him the same bringeth forth
[56:53] much fruit for without me ye can do
[56:55] nothing how many would say amen to that
[56:57] if you're not abiding in the vine you
[56:59] can do nothing you can't live this life
[57:01] without being connected by a new birth
[57:03] to the vine
[57:05] christ is the vine but the bride is the
[57:07] branches and the branches bear the fruit
[57:10] can you say amen next one if a man why
[57:13] not in me he is cast forth as a branch
[57:14] and his withered and men gather them and
[57:16] cast them into fire they are burned next
[57:18] one if you abide in me and my words
[57:20] abide in you ye shall ask what she will
[57:23] and it shall be done is there any more
[57:26] there this next one and if you abide me
[57:28] and here is my father glorified that you
[57:30] bear much fruit so shall you be my
[57:33] disciples
[57:34] it's wonderful and the father has loved
[57:36] me so i've loved you continuing my love
[57:38] so now what's the father's desire for
[57:40] you to bear
[57:42] not just little
[57:43] you know little
[57:45] puny little things
[57:47] and not just a few of them
[57:49] but
[57:52] jesus said
[57:53] i've predestinated you to bring forth
[57:56] much fruit
[57:59] and then he says if you're bringing
[58:00] forth fruit i'm going to prune you again
[58:04] that you'll bring forth even more fruit
[58:06] more fruit much fruit much fruit it's in
[58:08] there three times in there much fruit
[58:10] much fruit so he took the tree
[58:13] of life brother brown says he pruned it
[58:15] at calvary
[58:16] why did he prune that tree how many
[58:18] believe the tree of life was at calvary
[58:20] god pruned it at calvary then a bride
[58:22] comes forth a bride tree came the in the
[58:24] church and then when she gets started
[58:26] just a few years church organization
[58:28] began to try to take over and so at the
[58:31] end time the bride tree was birthed at
[58:33] pentecost but then church denominations
[58:36] and organizations the first organizat
[58:39] the first organized church was the the
[58:41] catholic church and from there many
[58:44] daughters that followed the systems and
[58:46] all of it has been denominational ideas
[58:50] mixed in with the bible
[58:53] so the bride tree couldn't thrive the
[58:55] bride tree couldn't be all that she was
[58:56] supposed to be
[58:59] but in the end time he says i will
[59:01] restore the bride tree i will restore
[59:04] and so in the end time he comes to prune
[59:07] the bride tree again and to plant her in
[59:09] the right place
[59:11] the end time message is to come and to
[59:13] prune the bride tree of all her
[59:16] denominational ideas
[59:20] the message has come to prune off all
[59:23] the things that are denominational ideas
[59:26] because we cannot bear the fruit of
[59:28] christ fully without with these
[59:30] denominational ideas so he speaks to
[59:32] that messenger he prunes this bride tree
[59:35] but he doesn't just prune it
[59:38] he plants it in the right place
[59:41] that's the bride tree friends
[59:43] he's watching over the whole thing it's
[59:45] time to bear the fruit it's time for
[59:47] adoption brother tony it's time to wrap
[59:49] this up and at the last days in the
[59:51] middle of satan's eaten i will have a
[59:53] bride tree and she'll have all of that
[59:56] beautiful fruit of the message in her
[59:57] life
[1:00:00] and it only happens when he prunes and
[1:00:03] friends if he prunes the bride tree
[1:00:06] universally then he prunes your life
[1:00:09] personally
[1:00:12] that's what people don't like is the
[1:00:13] pruning they don't like the rough
[1:00:15] preaching they don't other you see but
[1:00:16] god's gonna prune your life
[1:00:20] he says in the quote investments 1963
[1:00:23] and i'm watching my time here only been
[1:00:25] an hour i'm going to wrap it up and that
[1:00:26] great tree that great tree of life when
[1:00:29] he come on earth this is the one quote
[1:00:31] that i had if you you guys have it there
[1:00:33] that great tree that great tree of life
[1:00:35] when he come on earth they chopped it
[1:00:37] down by a roman spear and hung it on a
[1:00:40] roman tree
[1:00:43] isn't that amazing
[1:00:46] they took our tree of life and they hung
[1:00:48] it on a roman tree that's what the cross
[1:00:50] was made out of
[1:00:52] a cursed tree
[1:00:54] but in there he redeemed a bride tree
[1:00:56] the bride tree one just like him that
[1:00:58] eve tree from the garden of eden
[1:01:01] that tree that had fallen even the
[1:01:03] beginning and adam walked out with her
[1:01:05] now adam comes the second adam knowing
[1:01:08] that he had his eyes open to come to
[1:01:11] receive his eve and now as the prophet
[1:01:13] said
[1:01:14] genesis chapter 2 now genesis 2 he
[1:01:18] reaches inside of adam he brings out
[1:01:20] this female part that is to be the fruit
[1:01:22] bearer
[1:01:24] hallelujah
[1:01:26] and then that's only a type because at
[1:01:28] calvary his side is pierced blood and
[1:01:32] water come out the spirit of life come
[1:01:34] back where does it go on the woman in
[1:01:37] the upper room on the day of pentecost
[1:01:39] i'm gonna have a bride tree
[1:01:41] [Applause]
[1:01:45] the second eve is on the scene
[1:01:48] she is the one that's gonna bear the
[1:01:50] fruit and then that rotten devil begins
[1:01:53] to
[1:01:54] bring in all these denominational ideas
[1:01:56] and cut this tree down and cut it down
[1:01:59] to the roots and all the years that the
[1:02:01] palmer woman the
[1:02:03] palmer worm and the cankerworm begins to
[1:02:05] eat at that bride tree for 2 000 years
[1:02:07] of church history but joel says joel
[1:02:10] says i don't care how far they get it
[1:02:12] down to the stump
[1:02:13] i'm gonna send my prophet and i'm gonna
[1:02:16] restore her back to a blooming tree
[1:02:18] again hallelujah
[1:02:20] and friends if he said he's going to do
[1:02:23] that to the bride worldwide he's going
[1:02:25] to do it to your life personally
[1:02:27] i don't care what satan has taken away
[1:02:29] from you
[1:02:30] i will restore saith the lord
[1:02:36] you're under a god that has the power to
[1:02:38] restore everything that you've lost in
[1:02:40] your life
[1:02:41] [Applause]
[1:02:45] i don't care what he's taken away if it
[1:02:46] belongs to you god's going to give it
[1:02:48] back to you
[1:02:49] and you see
[1:02:50] people delivered from all their
[1:02:53] denominational ideas and all their
[1:02:55] addictions to pornography and to see
[1:02:57] them delivered from all their all their
[1:03:00] all their things that satan's beating
[1:03:02] them over the head about it to see them
[1:03:03] deliver to bitterness to see
[1:03:06] somebody delivered and god says i'm
[1:03:08] restoring that tree and to see them in
[1:03:11] church completely free with their hands
[1:03:13] raised i'm free to bear the fruit of the
[1:03:16] lord i'm free
[1:03:21] i don't have to come to church bound
[1:03:23] anymore i don't have to monday morning
[1:03:25] get about by the same things i'm a tree
[1:03:28] that's going to bloom with the message
[1:03:29] of god in my life
[1:03:31] because he said that i would
[1:03:32] [Applause]
[1:03:35] he said
[1:03:36] i will restore saith the lord and now as
[1:03:39] the prophet said the prophet said he
[1:03:41] said the prophet said david said he'll
[1:03:43] be like a tree that's planted by the
[1:03:45] rivers of water he's using the same
[1:03:47] scripture as my text to refer to the
[1:03:49] bride tree tree planted by the words
[1:03:51] grant it lord that we the waters of life
[1:03:54] will water this bride tree in the last
[1:03:57] days
[1:03:58] where all the denominational branches
[1:04:00] have been pruned by the husband men this
[1:04:03] message you think that's it's hard it's
[1:04:06] so harsh i don't even want to share with
[1:04:07] him but you better share it with people
[1:04:09] because it's not some mental man trying
[1:04:12] to be harsh
[1:04:13] sisters it's not some man trying to bind
[1:04:16] your life it's the husband man it's the
[1:04:19] farmer
[1:04:20] the great farmer
[1:04:22] is pruning your tree
[1:04:29] let him come let the husband come and
[1:04:31] prune my branch
[1:04:35] because i want to bear in life what i
[1:04:38] was supposed to bear
[1:04:41] who cares about a tree that's bearing
[1:04:42] bitterness and and all this other stuff
[1:04:44] in the world of worldliness and bound by
[1:04:46] pornography that's just you're a
[1:04:48] statistic like all the rest of them why
[1:04:50] don't you give the place i'm not going
[1:04:51] to bear that fruit anymore i'm here to
[1:04:54] bear the fruits of christ
[1:04:59] and he said i would
[1:05:01] is that the whole quote
[1:05:02] this bride tree he said it will water
[1:05:04] this bride tree and all the
[1:05:06] denominational branches have been pruned
[1:05:08] by the husband men and now the spirit of
[1:05:10] god is living anew in the top of the
[1:05:12] tree which come from the heart of the
[1:05:13] tree the word granite lord and this is
[1:05:15] in his prayer and may they bring forth
[1:05:18] much
[1:05:19] fruit
[1:05:27] this bride tree is going to bring forth
[1:05:29] much fruit
[1:05:31] she's doing it already
[1:05:34] he prunes off the denominational ideas
[1:05:38] the message does that it's still doing
[1:05:40] it he prunes off the denominational
[1:05:42] ideas that you have because he whatever
[1:05:43] background you come from whatever family
[1:05:45] you come from you have attachments there
[1:05:48] that are stunting your growth
[1:05:51] and ministry today i believe is not just
[1:05:54] ministering to blast the denominational
[1:05:57] systems
[1:05:59] brother braham says and is your life
[1:06:00] worthy
[1:06:01] just so we don't say yeah all those
[1:06:03] people out there let's just bring it
[1:06:05] home a minute he says and is your life
[1:06:08] worthy of the gospel
[1:06:09] he says
[1:06:12] a brother
[1:06:14] he says
[1:06:15] can bear
[1:06:17] he says if you don't follow christ daily
[1:06:20] you will take on an organizational life
[1:06:26] so there's no sense in blasting
[1:06:27] denominations when you and your thinking
[1:06:30] can be a denomination in yourself
[1:06:34] stunting the growth of fruit in your
[1:06:35] life
[1:06:37] and you may hold on to your baptist
[1:06:38] ideas you mean your pentecostal i'm not
[1:06:40] slamming the baptist all systems are
[1:06:42] wrong
[1:06:45] you may hold on to your pentecostal
[1:06:46] ideas that's why people don't go on with
[1:06:48] the fruits of the message because
[1:06:49] they're they're hanging back in
[1:06:50] pentecost they want to see a reviving of
[1:06:52] pentecost again
[1:06:53] it's not what we're here for
[1:06:56] there's ministers that haven't died to
[1:06:57] their pentecostal ideas and traditions
[1:07:00] pentecostal traditions
[1:07:02] haven't died to them and they're mixing
[1:07:03] them in with the message
[1:07:05] it'll confuse the people
[1:07:08] but we're called to the fruit in the
[1:07:09] tree
[1:07:10] his fruit and to do that he
[1:07:13] prunes your life
[1:07:16] i want to go to church where i'm being
[1:07:18] pruned
[1:07:20] amen
[1:07:22] and there's like a million other
[1:07:23] churches that you can go to and if you
[1:07:25] said i feel led to go somewhere else
[1:07:27] then people get scared to tell me that
[1:07:29] listen i want you to grow and thrive
[1:07:31] wherever you can grow if you're not
[1:07:33] doing it here you need to go you need to
[1:07:35] go i'm encouraging you find where you
[1:07:37] belong but there's a million churches
[1:07:39] that there's no pruning going on
[1:07:41] whatsoever they're too scared to do it
[1:07:43] they're too scared to bring the bear
[1:07:44] fisted gospel
[1:07:47] you can choose a place you're never
[1:07:48] going to hear anything that corrects
[1:07:50] your life
[1:07:51] but how good you are
[1:07:54] go for it
[1:07:55] i want to be in a church that's pruning
[1:07:56] me
[1:07:57] the word is pruning me because then i'm
[1:08:00] bringing forth what the real fruit of a
[1:08:02] christian is
[1:08:03] ah
[1:08:04] praise the lord i gotta find a place to
[1:08:06] end here i'm over time
[1:08:08] amen
[1:08:10] so
[1:08:14] not just
[1:08:16] to be
[1:08:16] [Music]
[1:08:18] visiting
[1:08:20] this scripture is not about to just
[1:08:22] visit the river
[1:08:25] when you need help
[1:08:29] well i got another sermon on it
[1:08:31] some people just visit the river
[1:08:34] when they need help
[1:08:36] take a little trip to the river today
[1:08:38] because i need to be encouraged this
[1:08:41] tree is not visiting the river this tree
[1:08:43] is planted by the river and its roots
[1:08:46] are going down i'm here i'm settled
[1:08:50] nothing's changing
[1:08:53] that's why
[1:08:54] we have too much worry brother rap so
[1:08:57] capably brought that service last sunday
[1:09:00] what a blessing
[1:09:03] wonderful message
[1:09:04] because that's where we live many times
[1:09:06] where the devil and there's the trouble
[1:09:08] with many is that that worry is because
[1:09:11] we're not living close enough and
[1:09:12] planted by the river
[1:09:16] you seek
[1:09:17] god for temporary help
[1:09:20] we have a host of people that many times
[1:09:22] seek god for temporary help and in an
[1:09:24] emergency they seek god
[1:09:28] but it's not being planted close to the
[1:09:30] river
[1:09:32] i heard a quote from corey tim boom this
[1:09:34] week i loved it it's very short
[1:09:36] it talks about our prayer life
[1:09:38] i heard a quote from
[1:09:40] this i have and i'm going to quote it
[1:09:42] because i heard this quote from corey
[1:09:44] timberlao and i have a lot of confidence
[1:09:45] in her life
[1:09:47] and what she knew of the lord
[1:09:49] and she she said this and it cut to the
[1:09:51] very core of me
[1:09:54] is prayer
[1:09:55] your steering will
[1:09:57] or your spare tire
[1:10:04] enough said
[1:10:08] because you can use prayer as your spare
[1:10:11] tire
[1:10:13] you can visit the river
[1:10:15] when you're emotionally wanting
[1:10:16] something
[1:10:18] but that's not what i'm preaching this
[1:10:20] morning
[1:10:21] i'm preaching a believer a son and
[1:10:23] daughter of god saying lord plant me
[1:10:25] right by the life
[1:10:29] and let my roots go down so deep that i
[1:10:31] would never move again
[1:10:35] young person if you could say that to
[1:10:37] the lord from your heart this morning i
[1:10:38] need and see that's when young people
[1:10:40] they're in the foundation stage of their
[1:10:42] their in foundations you can lay the
[1:10:44] right ones or you can lay the wrong ones
[1:10:48] god's a god of right foundations
[1:10:50] and you're such an important time of the
[1:10:52] decisions you make now in your teen
[1:10:54] years will affect your years for life
[1:10:56] down the road say well i've already made
[1:10:59] some wrong ones correct them right away
[1:11:01] say god forgive me of that
[1:11:03] you've sown a bad seed
[1:11:06] then the way to change it is to start
[1:11:07] see sowing the right seeds so you can
[1:11:10] have the right harvest
[1:11:11] your life can be fruit bearing your life
[1:11:13] can be joy your life can be happiness i
[1:11:16] don't care what you've been through
[1:11:18] your life
[1:11:19] can be the exuberance
[1:11:21] of the spirit of god and the freshness
[1:11:23] of the holy spirit
[1:11:25] there isn't any
[1:11:27] sin there isn't any fault there isn't
[1:11:30] any mistake that would keep a believer
[1:11:32] bound to that to the rest of their life
[1:11:34] there isn't one of them
[1:11:35] god's grace and restoration says i can
[1:11:38] bring them out of anything and will
[1:11:39] thrive in the kingdom of god
[1:11:43] how many believe what i'm preaching this
[1:11:44] morning if we don't believe it we
[1:11:46] shouldn't come to church we believe the
[1:11:48] presence of the lord can cause you to
[1:11:50] thrive no matter what you've been
[1:11:51] through
[1:11:53] i believe it with all my heart can you
[1:11:54] say amen i believe that god can cause us
[1:11:58] and we don't want to be our prayers to
[1:12:00] be spare tires we want to be just
[1:12:01] visiting the river every now and then we
[1:12:03] want to be planted in the house of the
[1:12:05] lord planted by our families a brother
[1:12:08] was asking me this week about
[1:12:10] his uh decisions for different things
[1:12:12] got to making careers and the the thing
[1:12:15] is i always have basically the same
[1:12:16] answer as a pastor i'll tell you what i
[1:12:18] told him i'll tell you you're going to
[1:12:19] get the same answer in those decisions
[1:12:22] pray about it with all your heart and i
[1:12:23] believe god will lead you but one thing
[1:12:25] for sure god is going to bless a man who
[1:12:28] makes a decision to stay close to the
[1:12:30] word of god
[1:12:31] where there's a channel feeding your
[1:12:33] family
[1:12:34] and that you have your family in church
[1:12:37] you don't pick some career and i'm
[1:12:38] talking to everybody now you don't just
[1:12:40] pick some career it's gonna keep you out
[1:12:41] of church constantly and keep your
[1:12:43] family and you're away somewhere else
[1:12:45] and your family is just struggling along
[1:12:48] god can't bless a decision like that
[1:12:50] you might make less money but you want
[1:12:52] to make those two priorities top of the
[1:12:54] line because you know why this is an
[1:12:57] hour not to be replanted and plan moving
[1:12:59] around we need to be planted and know
[1:13:01] where we belong
[1:13:02] [Applause]
[1:13:05] and we need to be there
[1:13:06] with our kids watching us there
[1:13:10] never seen a god not prosper a man
[1:13:14] that's made decisions like
[1:13:16] that hallelujah
[1:13:19] his prayer your steering wheel or your
[1:13:22] spare tire you know i took an hour
[1:13:25] 15 minutes to preach and
[1:13:27] corey ten boom does it in one sentence
[1:13:33] and i don't even believe in women
[1:13:34] preachers
[1:13:39] shouldn't have said that
[1:13:42] we don't live on worry
[1:13:45] the scripture brother read is familiar
[1:13:46] to us be careful for nothing don't worry
[1:13:49] about anything but in everything
[1:13:52] through prayer
[1:13:53] that's prayer without ceasing
[1:13:55] i said i'm not going to bind myself with
[1:13:57] worrying about something i'm going to my
[1:13:59] god every moment if i have to
[1:14:02] i'm not going when i'm in emergency for
[1:14:04] a spare tire
[1:14:06] this is a steering wheel that's guiding
[1:14:08] my life
[1:14:12] praise the lord
[1:14:14] let's stand together
[1:14:19] what i like about that tree friends
[1:14:28] planted
[1:14:29] the roots go down
[1:14:31] your roots go deep enough there's no way
[1:14:33] to get that out
[1:14:35] and take one of those
[1:14:38] machines
[1:14:39] you'd have to rent it from brother
