[0:00] God and read it together in Luke chapter
[0:02] 21
[0:06] and we're going to have several specials
[0:07] tonight from different churches and I
[0:09] think they weren't able to get to one
[0:10] this morning so we'll get those this
[0:13] evening and we have several BCF and
[0:16] different churches that prepared
[0:17] specials for the Tri-State youth meeting
[0:19] that starts at five o'clock knock six
[0:21] five o'clock this afternoon and we're
[0:23] looking forward to some testimonies and
[0:25] also some specials and then my son
[0:27] Gideon will be speaking to the young
[0:29] people tonight you're welcome to come
[0:30] all of you whatever age you are Luke
[0:33] chapter 21 and verse 25.
[0:37] Luke 21 and verse 25 and there shall be
[0:42] signs in the Sun and in the moon and in
[0:45] the Stars
[0:46] and upon the Earth distress of nations
[0:49] with perplexity the Sea and the waves
[0:53] roaring men's Hearts failing them for
[0:56] fear and for looking after those things
[0:58] which are coming on the earth one place
[1:01] and one of the gospels says looking at
[1:03] the fearful sights it's termed fearful
[1:05] sights and looking after those things
[1:08] which are coming on the earth for the
[1:09] powers of Heaven shall be shaken so we
[1:13] have words like distress we have
[1:15] perplexity we have fear in men's Hearts
[1:18] their hearts failing them for fear we
[1:21] have fearful sights that are watching
[1:22] how can they see fearful sights
[1:24] constantly in front of them through
[1:26] television and through their phones
[1:27] there's fearful sights that brings more
[1:29] fear and perplexity and stress verse 27
[1:33] and then shall they see the son of man
[1:34] coming in in a cloud with power and
[1:37] great glory and when these things begin
[1:39] to come to pass then look up and lift up
[1:41] your heads for your Redemption draweth
[1:44] nigh
[1:45] and he spake to them a parable behold
[1:47] the Fig Tree and all the trees when they
[1:50] now shoot forth you see and know of
[1:52] yourselves that summer is now nigh at
[1:55] hand so the Fig Tree is typed as Israel
[1:57] and all the other trees in other words
[1:59] everything begins to come into this
[2:02] Bloom and the summertime and begins to
[2:04] come into its full manifestation all
[2:07] things bad or good come to full
[2:09] manifestation at the end time and when
[2:12] we see them come to full manifestation
[2:14] when we see the Fig Tree Israel become a
[2:17] nation and come in their own nation and
[2:19] now looking for their Revival when we
[2:21] see all of the Nations and all the
[2:23] spirits come to a head and manifest all
[2:26] the trees coming into that manifestation
[2:28] then we know we're close to the end
[2:32] Jesus said this so likewise ye when ye
[2:34] see these things come to pass know ye
[2:37] that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand
[2:39] verily I send you this generation shall
[2:41] not pass till all be fulfilled look at
[2:44] this now Heaven and Earth shall pass
[2:47] away but my words shall not pass away
[2:53] this is the generation that will observe
[2:55] and watch Heaven and Earth passing away
[3:00] but when we watch that pass away then we
[3:04] always know that there's one thing that
[3:06] will endure and not become corrupt how
[3:08] many know that every system is becoming
[3:10] corrupt
[3:11] but there's one thing that can't corrupt
[3:13] and that's the word of God
[3:15] the only thing we have left that won't
[3:17] corrupt is the word of God but we'll be
[3:20] the generation that watches his Heaven
[3:22] Earth and things begin to pass away and
[3:25] things begin to fall apart I want you to
[3:27] notice as I preach out of verse 34 this
[3:29] morning and take heed there's this
[3:31] warning to watch yourself Be watchful
[3:33] take heed to yourselves it's a personal
[3:36] thing in this hour take heed to
[3:39] yourselves lest at any time your hearts
[3:42] become overcharged with surfeiting and
[3:45] drunkenness and cares and worries of
[3:48] this life and so that day come upon you
[3:51] unawares
[3:54] for as a snare shall it come on all them
[3:57] that dwell on the face of the whole
[4:00] earth I want to speak this morning on
[4:03] the cure for emotional and mental
[4:05] instability
[4:09] God never left us without a cure
[4:12] but you can see Jesus said in verse 34
[4:16] that we could be affected and our
[4:18] emotional life would be depleted because
[4:22] of the fear in this generation all will
[4:25] be affected by it
[4:27] and we can become emotionally and
[4:29] mentally depleted
[4:33] but God
[4:35] but God
[4:37] provides for his people in that hour
[4:40] he gives the Cure
[4:41] Lord bless your word may you anoint me
[4:44] like you've never anointed me before the
[4:46] hour is late the time is late God it's
[4:49] time for us to lay down every frivolous
[4:52] thing every gossip every everything Lord
[4:55] that causes us to mistrust your word it
[4:58] is the only thing that we can preach
[5:00] that will bring hope to the people God
[5:02] help us strengthen us and may we lay
[5:04] down every shadow and everything that
[5:06] hinders us from the word of God today as
[5:09] we commit to you in the name of the Lord
[5:10] Jesus Christ amen everybody said amen
[5:13] amen God bless you may be seated
[5:18] so I'm looking here this morning at
[5:20] Jesus depiction of our day and uh
[5:23] prophesying and giving us exactly the
[5:26] characteristics of our time and we can
[5:28] see a last warning here that our hearts
[5:32] did not become weighed down when he says
[5:34] overcharge that means our hearts become
[5:37] weighed down our hearts become drained
[5:40] our Spirits become emotionally drained
[5:43] and we should be on guard for that as
[5:46] Christians he's not just talking to
[5:47] everybody but particularly Christians
[5:49] he's speaking directly to us because he
[5:52] says there if you if you catch it take
[5:54] heed to yourselves it's a personal thing
[5:56] that that your hearts that your hearts
[5:59] he's speaking to the elect that your
[6:01] hearts your spirit your emotions don't
[6:05] become depleted and drained be on guard
[6:08] for that in the in one of the Amplified
[6:10] versions it says take heed to yourselves
[6:13] and be on guard because some of these
[6:15] words you know I always have to look up
[6:17] when it says surfing your heart's
[6:20] overcharged with surfing I'm I'm
[6:22] thinking of surfing
[6:24] drunkenness I understand
[6:26] but you know okay so don't get into
[6:29] surfing and being drunk
[6:31] it's deeper than that you know I don't
[6:33] think your heart could become
[6:34] overcharged and burdened with when
[6:36] you're out surfing
[6:38] so that's why you have to get up your
[6:40] Bible and look up these words sometimes
[6:42] so the Amplified says but take heed to
[6:44] yourselves and be on guard lest your
[6:46] hearts be overburdened and depressed
[6:48] weighed down
[6:50] with get with the giddiness and headache
[6:54] and nausea of self-indulgence
[6:58] drunkenness
[7:00] and worldly worries and cares pertaining
[7:04] to the business of this life
[7:07] we live there friends
[7:09] this is dead on of what we go through to
[7:13] deplete us emotionally
[7:15] so I'm going to read it again that we
[7:16] become depressed and weighed down with
[7:19] the giddiness and the headache and the
[7:21] nausea of self-indulgence drunkenness
[7:23] because that's what the world world
[7:25] teaches us to be in other words they
[7:27] have things to answer to this scare they
[7:30] have things to answer to this fear when
[7:33] we're emotionally feeling shaky and
[7:35] unstable then they have answers but
[7:37] they're temporary answers they're
[7:38] temporary fixes for it
[7:41] and so so now the headache the giddiness
[7:44] the nausea of self-indulgence that's
[7:46] what the the world wants you to do
[7:48] drunkenness and worldly worries and
[7:50] cares pertaining to the business of the
[7:52] of this life lest that day come upon you
[7:56] suddenly like a trap or a noose in the
[7:59] last verse 35 says for as a snare shall
[8:02] it come so now a snare is a trap for an
[8:05] animal it gets you snare to get your
[8:07] heart snared it gets you under a bind
[8:09] can you say amen and the world's going
[8:11] to do that but Believers got to say wait
[8:13] a minute now I'm not supposed to be
[8:15] bound by anything this is just about
[8:17] time for Redemption I'm supposed to look
[8:19] up and live my head up can you say mine
[8:21] I'm not like the statistics to get
[8:24] burdened down by this I have a source
[8:26] that I can go to I have a fountain that
[8:29] I can drink from
[8:33] my main focus this morning is to tell us
[8:36] that we when we get emotionally depleted
[8:39] and in stable emotionally and mentally
[8:42] that we are not to buy into the idea
[8:46] that there's somehow no fountain in God
[8:48] that can get fill us up
[8:53] we are not to give up that he doesn't
[8:56] have some Fountain open for us to drink
[8:58] from to fill our emotional need
[9:01] we cannot buy into that lie God has
[9:05] given his word to this generation and
[9:08] that word is sufficient to take care of
[9:10] our need during this time
[9:12] as a matter of fact his word you don't
[9:14] think it well it's for my soul the words
[9:16] for my soul no God provides for
[9:18] emotional depletion God provides to fill
[9:21] you God provides for a sound mind God
[9:23] provides any instability that you're
[9:25] feeling can you say amen God provides
[9:28] for it what I find is most of our
[9:30] generation and many in the message are
[9:32] turning to other things for their
[9:34] emotional stability
[9:36] oh brother Paul are you gonna go there
[9:38] I'm gonna go there
[9:41] I'm finding that a lot of us are turning
[9:44] to other things to fill or avoid or void
[9:48] emotionally
[9:55] we are an addictive Society
[9:58] David Cartwright wrote in a book a
[10:00] couple of 2019 you wrote a book called
[10:02] We're the age of addiction the age of
[10:04] addiction you can look it up and uh
[10:07] David Courtright writes that we are the
[10:09] complete age addiction and the summary
[10:11] for the book he said at the beginning he
[10:13] says we live in an age of addiction
[10:15] from compulsive gaming
[10:18] and shopping to binge eating so now when
[10:21] we think of addiction we think of
[10:22] marijuana we think of someone in an
[10:24] insane it's all someone uh dope addict
[10:27] you find in the message referred to dope
[10:29] addiction with the prophet because that
[10:31] was prevalent all the way back to the
[10:33] 50s and so that's the addiction we think
[10:35] of but this fella he's mentioned we're
[10:37] addictive Society we have a lot of
[10:39] things that are addictions can you say
[10:40] amen and he says his addiction from
[10:42] compulsive gaming and shopping to binge
[10:45] eating and opio opioid I never can say
[10:48] that word opioid abuse sugar can be as
[10:51] habit-forming as cocaine researchers
[10:54] tell us and social media apps are
[10:58] hooking our kids
[11:00] but what can we do to resist temptations
[11:04] that insidiously and deliberately rewire
[11:08] our brains what's he saying all these
[11:10] things over time rewire our brains
[11:14] they mess with our sound thinking
[11:18] what can we do that that we can resist
[11:22] the temptation that insidiously and
[11:25] deliberately rewire our brains he said
[11:27] nothing nothing
[11:28] David Cartwright says unless we
[11:31] understand the history and character of
[11:32] the global Enterprises and the the
[11:34] corporations unless we understand the
[11:37] history and character of them that
[11:39] create and cater to our bad habits
[11:45] so you can read the book because then he
[11:47] explores of course he doesn't have the
[11:48] answer he says they're not really the
[11:50] answer but he said maybe we could look
[11:51] at all the corporates that are
[11:53] contributing the corporations the
[11:54] Enterprises contributing knowing that we
[11:56] have this weakness knowing that America
[11:58] is this way knowing that we lean towards
[12:01] addiction because of our emotional
[12:02] depletion knowing that they gauge
[12:05] everything in entertainment and in
[12:07] selling whatever it is they gauge it so
[12:10] that they can become they can become the
[12:14] Creator and cater to our bad habits in
[12:17] other words some in some ways we can
[12:19] help you
[12:21] but when they go to help you it's not
[12:23] really helping you
[12:25] it's leading you more and more to
[12:27] addiction because guess why they want
[12:28] you to be addicted to their product
[12:30] because they make money
[12:32] it's all about the Mighty Dollar
[12:34] come on now
[12:36] they're going to make money off of you
[12:37] they're going to make money off of
[12:39] medicines they're going to make money
[12:40] and trust me today I am not criticizing
[12:42] I'm not criticizing something that helps
[12:44] a person but I'm here as a gospel
[12:46] Minister that has to point you to what
[12:48] Jesus said and that we Believers guard
[12:50] ourselves be from becoming to addict too
[12:54] addictive to something that is is to be
[12:56] the all answer for our emotional
[12:59] depletion
[13:05] man eating from the Tree of knowledge is
[13:08] trying to help us in his way as he
[13:11] ignores the Tree of Life man eating from
[13:14] that tree is ignoring the tree of life
[13:16] that we can eat from so now addictions
[13:18] how many no addictions start somewhere
[13:23] and man provides remedies of all kinds
[13:27] I'm using the term from the message as
[13:29] uh the messenger says that they have
[13:32] remedies all kinds of Remedies but not a
[13:35] cure so now man provides all kinds of
[13:38] remedies of all kinds where does all
[13:40] this start though the craving number one
[13:42] the craving in the soul for peace
[13:46] let's start with the soul
[13:48] Man without the Peace of the holy spirit
[13:51] in his life the Holy Ghost in his life
[13:53] will be craving that his entire life and
[13:55] Satan has alternatives to bring that
[13:58] peace to his soul in other words being
[13:59] settled with God
[14:01] being settled being settled that God
[14:04] I've accepted his his uh his uh journey
[14:08] to Calvary I accepted what he's done I
[14:11] receive What the Lord Has Done For Me
[14:13] because I'm a sinner I need to be saved
[14:15] every person in this room was born a
[14:17] sinner
[14:20] every person in this room was born a
[14:22] sinner unacceptable to God
[14:24] but the problem is is we try to do good
[14:26] works and we try to do things that would
[14:28] give us a little bit of temporary peace
[14:30] to make us feel good in our soul but God
[14:32] says I don't want you to do that I want
[14:34] you to receive me and you receive peace
[14:36] come to me all ye that are weary and
[14:40] heavy laden why are they weary why are
[14:42] they having Laden trying to get peace on
[14:45] their own but God says come to me for
[14:47] your peace come to me for your
[14:50] settlement and I will give rest for your
[14:53] souls
[14:55] so a man or woman can come to complete
[14:58] rest in their soul level that they are
[15:01] it's been settled God has accepted me
[15:04] because I have accepted his Calvary
[15:07] experience I've accepted what he's done
[15:08] for me and now I'm accepted not because
[15:11] I earned it not because I deserve it but
[15:13] he has accepted me already he died for
[15:16] my sins
[15:19] and it meets the craving but if you
[15:22] don't find that if she doesn't find that
[15:24] they will search their whole life
[15:26] because they got a craving in their soul
[15:29] you have a craving in your soul
[15:32] and the other bad part is people fill it
[15:34] with religion
[15:36] in the message
[15:39] they fill it with something that they do
[15:41] if I can just do this and make Mommy and
[15:44] Daddy happy or make brother Paul happy
[15:46] and if I can just wear this and if I
[15:48] could just be this and be a good girl
[15:49] and do all this stuff so you move into
[15:51] that mode of putting something on the
[15:53] outside but a lot of people they still
[15:55] haven't met the craving on the inside
[15:58] there's a craving that no dress no
[16:02] outward religion there's a craving that
[16:04] none of that will ever satisfy it's his
[16:08] spirit that pours out in your life as
[16:10] you accepted and all of a sudden peace
[16:13] comes that I am at peace with God I am
[16:15] in relationship with God let the world
[16:18] fall apart I am at peace with him
[16:23] God help every person that's listening
[16:26] under the sound of my voice this morning
[16:28] here and on the broadcast and on the
[16:31] internet wherever you are I pray you'll
[16:33] seek God to meet that craving in your
[16:36] soul
[16:38] please
[16:39] Please Don't Pass God by
[16:42] please
[16:52] Hallelujah
[16:55] so
[16:56] that's the soul
[16:58] but emotional and a mental and mental
[17:02] stability comes
[17:05] even after someone sometimes has the
[17:08] rest in their soul
[17:11] emotional mental instability can come to
[17:14] Christians
[17:16] some people don't want to admit that but
[17:18] all you need to do is look in the Bible
[17:20] and look at some of the prophets
[17:24] and some of them they called insane
[17:26] because it looked like they were going
[17:27] insane
[17:29] you don't need to look further than your
[17:30] message you want to look in the message
[17:31] you could see that the servant of God
[17:33] for this generation went through times
[17:35] being emotionally drained and depleted
[17:40] and so there's when that happens then
[17:43] there's there's a need to it for it to
[17:46] be filled with something to calm the
[17:49] nurse something to calm the emotional
[17:50] depletion today usually the instability
[17:53] to humans comes from three main things
[17:56] an addiction addiction originates in
[18:00] three main things and that is a past
[18:02] family dysfunction a past family
[18:05] dysfunction
[18:06] and then the second thing is a real bad
[18:09] trauma happened in life that's the
[18:11] second thing a past family dysfunction a
[18:15] real bad family a bill a real bad trauma
[18:17] that happened to you whether it happened
[18:18] to you when you're five years old or
[18:20] they happened to you last week it's a
[18:23] trauma to your spirit it's a trauma to
[18:25] your emotions
[18:27] and third thing is the pressure of the
[18:29] Demonic realm existing that we live in
[18:32] now is there's a pressure from the
[18:33] Demonic realm particularly the sexual
[18:36] Temptation and the saturation of filthy
[18:38] sexual things in front of us
[18:41] so it's saturated with that and that
[18:43] brings the pressure on the human Spirit
[18:45] a Temptation on the human Spirit you're
[18:49] trying to hold to God but around us is
[18:51] this demonic Force this demonic pressure
[18:53] especially on our young people but it's
[18:55] on every it's on everywhere so three
[18:57] things can cause people to to run
[19:00] towards some addiction to help them
[19:02] relieve and calm themselves but you got
[19:03] to go back to the source that some past
[19:06] family dysfunction took place you grew
[19:08] up with something that affected you and
[19:10] we might as well be honest ever you know
[19:12] I like to say that uh you know the
[19:15] people come to our church and people
[19:17] come and they come from dysfunctional
[19:18] families
[19:20] um probably most of us come from some
[19:22] dysfunction from our family
[19:25] oh I had a pretty good dad and mom had a
[19:28] pretty good life most of us come and
[19:30] then I always like to say we all were
[19:32] born from a dysfunctional family Adam
[19:34] and Eve
[19:38] it's interesting what brother Jared said
[19:41] in the office this morning he says I was
[19:43] talking about you know if they're gonna
[19:44] out if they're going to get outlaw guns
[19:46] let them go ahead and do it I'll sign on
[19:48] outlawing guns when they sign off first
[19:50] on outlawing pornography outlawing video
[19:53] games outlawing the internet
[19:57] outlawing Hollywood television shows
[20:00] that have sex and cussing and all this
[20:01] stuff Outlaw all that first and then I
[20:03] might sign off on a gun but brother
[20:05] Jared said it's an interesting they're
[20:06] going to find some way to murder because
[20:08] they're not changing the hearts you can
[20:09] eliminate all the guns and somebody's
[20:11] going to kill you anyway
[20:12] Kane didn't have a gun
[20:17] Kane
[20:18] the seed of the serpent did not have a
[20:21] gun and he's found a way to murder his
[20:24] brother
[20:26] oh what a world we live in that politics
[20:28] thinks in their arrogance they can
[20:30] change it by getting rid of this it's
[20:32] not the gun it's a man's heart that's
[20:34] craving for the real thing of God
[20:38] and when they don't get it they become
[20:40] addicted
[20:41] to whatever their addiction is they
[20:43] become more addicted to it it feeds the
[20:46] mind
[20:47] and they don't know how to handle it and
[20:49] so they act
[20:50] it's these things that lead to looking
[20:52] for remedies
[20:54] a family a family trauma
[20:57] the a family dysfunction a bad trauma
[21:00] that happened to your life and the
[21:02] Demonic realm we're fighting against if
[21:04] these things in these things then it
[21:06] leads to looking for remedies everybody
[21:08] I want you to just think of not just
[21:09] think of medicine this morning when I
[21:11] think of Remedies okay I don't want you
[21:13] to think of just medicine
[21:17] there are hundreds of other remedies
[21:21] to
[21:22] fill
[21:24] the emotional
[21:26] instable person
[21:32] entertainment
[21:36] books
[21:38] music
[21:40] movies
[21:42] fashions
[21:44] social media
[21:48] you know when you get to these parts
[21:49] just like it's like I say these things
[21:51] just
[21:53] falls on the floor
[21:58] gaming
[22:00] Sports
[22:02] role playing
[22:04] meditation
[22:06] concerts
[22:09] things that emotionally charge us
[22:12] a concert will emotionally charge us
[22:14] even Christian concerts
[22:19] now you trust me now even highly charged
[22:22] emotional gospel meetings
[22:25] even cat meetings
[22:29] that are emotionally charged and I'm not
[22:31] talking about the ones that are
[22:32] preaching the word of God in the right
[22:33] thing but emotionally charged will
[22:36] appeal to someone who's is drained
[22:39] emotionally but listen listen be careful
[22:41] because someone could be be come into an
[22:45] emotionally charged atmosphere and be
[22:46] affected emotionally by it and get very
[22:49] excited but it still can be just a
[22:51] temporary emotional fix because when you
[22:54] go back you have the same addiction when
[22:57] you go back you have nothing to overcome
[22:58] with
[22:59] it's a deception just to present an
[23:02] emotional atmosphere so people feel so
[23:05] great at camp but then they don't feel
[23:07] so great when they get home
[23:10] I Can't Get Enough amens
[23:12] I'll have to read it in the message
[23:14] later to show you Pentecost did that
[23:16] it's a charge emotionally many times and
[23:18] God was doing good things through that
[23:20] praise the Lord and He will do that but
[23:22] always be on guard that you don't fill
[23:24] your emotional instability
[23:27] with just another emotionally charged
[23:30] concert or service
[23:37] blessed be the name of the Lord so
[23:40] something becomes addictive when
[23:41] physically and mentally we become
[23:43] dependent on a particular substance and
[23:46] unable to stop taking it without
[23:48] incurring adverse effects that's the
[23:50] meaning out of the dictionary of what
[23:52] addiction addict being addictive is
[23:54] physically and mentally dependent on a
[23:57] particular substance and unable to stop
[23:58] taking it without incurring adverse
[24:00] effects in other words enthusiastically
[24:03] here's another meaning to addictive
[24:04] enthusiastically devoted to a particular
[24:07] thing or an activity
[24:09] that's not drugs
[24:11] that's enthusiastically devoted to a
[24:13] particular thing or an activity
[24:16] that can become an addiction
[24:18] and what's the addiction for trying to
[24:20] fill an emotional need
[24:22] people go to all kinds of sources to
[24:25] fill their emotional need and I'm here
[24:27] to tell you this morning
[24:28] some of them are good some of them are
[24:31] okay but we can't only go to those
[24:33] things
[24:34] we have to go to God even for our
[24:38] emotional and mental stability
[24:42] so the devil deceives this in that
[24:44] message book or that Bible oh this this
[24:46] there's nothing in here as I read
[24:48] there's nothing in here for me feeling
[24:50] emotionally unstable right now it's got
[24:52] to be something it's not in here that's
[24:53] a lie
[24:55] that's a lie in the presence of the Lord
[24:57] in his word as we as we stay with it
[25:00] young people stay with it read it say
[25:01] God reveal it to me because there is a
[25:04] filling of our emotional need even it
[25:07] fills our souls it fills our minds it
[25:09] fills our bodies even physical healing
[25:12] is in the word of God
[25:14] you can't buy into the deception that
[25:17] modern problems and the reason I'm
[25:18] feeling emotionally depleted because of
[25:20] an incident a trauma that happened the
[25:22] reason I had the the answer for it has
[25:25] got to be some somewhere else some
[25:28] people even seek emotional filling from
[25:30] their own families and I even do that
[25:34] you know we we love our families and so
[25:36] we we gravitate towards them but it's
[25:39] still Limited
[25:42] it's still Limited
[25:46] it's still not the fulfilling that we
[25:49] need to fill with
[25:51] can I get an amen
[25:53] your wife your husband a boyfriend a
[25:55] girlfriend young people will will fill
[25:58] the void of their craving for fellowship
[26:00] and they think that the answer all is if
[26:03] I can just be closer to this person and
[26:06] and they can feel and then they start
[26:08] doing it they start filling that void
[26:10] that craving that's within them and they
[26:12] this is the answer so now we need to do
[26:14] this we need to move on and so you have
[26:16] to be careful though because you have to
[26:18] fill your Void emotionally first with
[26:21] our lord Jesus first
[26:23] because if it's only in that boyfriend
[26:26] or girlfriend or that husband or wife it
[26:29] will disappoint you someday and you'll
[26:31] still feel a lack on the inside it has
[26:34] to be with our loving savior that we
[26:36] find that emotional stability
[26:42] amen praise the Lord
[26:45] so now uh we keep going back and it's
[26:49] filling an emotional thing that we have
[26:51] need of but it's temporary many times
[26:53] it's not solving the problem but we keep
[26:55] going back and we keep going back we're
[26:57] still not settled and stable and our
[26:59] emotions are thinking and so there's no
[27:01] sense being critical of dope addicts
[27:03] this morning and marijuana and all the
[27:06] stores my goodness I drove up to Monroe
[27:08] the other night and every other store is
[27:10] a a place they must be selling it
[27:14] because they wouldn't be up with making
[27:16] money like that with three or four
[27:17] stores every block three or four
[27:20] places
[27:22] now there's become legal in our state
[27:25] there's no sense being critical of the
[27:27] dope addicts though
[27:32] there's no sense and yeah they're an
[27:34] addict they're addicted to that thing
[27:37] look at your own life
[27:39] what are you feeling your emotional need
[27:41] with
[27:44] more likely there's something
[27:46] calms you calms your nerve sometimes
[27:49] laughing calms our nerves and you know
[27:51] uh it's not like that's an evil thing
[27:53] except for it can't be the ultimate
[27:55] thing
[27:56] because as as the prophet said about
[27:58] Hollywood The Comedians will get us to
[28:01] laugh and we'll forget all of our
[28:02] problems because emotionally that's what
[28:04] it does but when we go back home we have
[28:05] the same problems
[28:07] we haven't solved the issues and we've
[28:09] been we've been refilled a little bit by
[28:11] laughter and we laugh and we enjoy it
[28:13] you can even come to church like this
[28:15] and temporarily feel good
[28:20] but there has to be something deeper in
[28:22] our lives something more lasting
[28:24] something more consistent I believe I'm
[28:26] going to bring that answer to you here
[28:27] this morning there's no sense in being
[28:29] critical the dope addicts there's no
[28:31] sense in being critical of an alcoholic
[28:34] when we turn to something instead of the
[28:36] Lord to fill our emotional needs
[28:42] and the the messenger says it this way
[28:45] he says we find out that many people try
[28:48] to find comfort and so he's in talking
[28:51] about our our comforter in the message
[28:52] here he cares to you care he gets into
[28:55] people filling because they need a
[28:56] comforter we find out that many people
[28:58] try to find
[29:00] Comfort by drinking you know we have a
[29:02] saying which is pretty well known among
[29:04] us today I think it is 1963 that there
[29:07] are many ministers drink sometimes
[29:08] before they go to the pulpit a good
[29:10] heavy drink of intoxication and it's
[29:13] been known to seeing ministers on the
[29:14] platform that are even staggering under
[29:16] the influence of liquor and that ought
[29:18] not to be stopped right there well I got
[29:20] it right here right and that ought not
[29:22] to be it should not be he's not going to
[29:24] justify that at all but I want you to
[29:26] next watch the next comment
[29:29] if I can figure out how to do this
[29:31] right in the middle
[29:33] is because many times we might condemn
[29:36] the ban when maybe we ought not to do
[29:40] that
[29:43] we're talking about Pharisees
[29:46] we're talking about Pharisees in the
[29:48] message
[29:49] that can look at one thing and say oh
[29:51] that's terrible addiction hear that he's
[29:53] an alcoholic
[29:55] maybe we should not do that we ought to
[29:58] find back what's the trouble
[30:01] oh that's psychology no the prophet said
[30:04] it maybe we should have a care and
[30:06] understanding where the trouble started
[30:08] because the alcohol is not the problem
[30:12] the alcohol is only what Satan has given
[30:14] to fill a void in his life that's all he
[30:17] knows
[30:18] and it relieves the tension it's not
[30:20] right it's wrong we would never justify
[30:22] it but yet we shouldn't stand there just
[30:24] created being critical where does it
[30:26] come from we ought to find back what's
[30:29] the trouble many of them was converted
[30:31] from alcohol many preachers were
[30:33] converted from alcohol and we find out
[30:35] if they are in that condition it's a
[30:38] disgrace it's a reproach to the body of
[30:40] Christ of course if we if you heard I
[30:42] was doing that you would probably most
[30:44] of you maybe even leave my church
[30:47] and and I would agree you probably
[30:49] should you've got to have confidence in
[30:51] me as a minister I'm bringing you the
[30:54] preaching of the word to for the saving
[30:56] of your souls that's a pretty important
[30:58] position the trust has to be there
[31:01] if it's not let me say this to you if
[31:03] the trust is not there you don't have to
[31:05] look at me as a man but if the trust is
[31:07] there to handle the word for your lives
[31:08] you've got to go find a church or a
[31:10] preacher you've got full trust in
[31:13] I challenge you to do it for your
[31:15] children's sake for your sake because
[31:17] it's all about trust today
[31:19] if you trust me with your souls but if I
[31:21] did this my yeah it would be a disgrace
[31:23] it would be a reproach probably be the
[31:25] end of my Ministry you see but yet you
[31:28] could you could have all that reaction
[31:29] to it and yet but what was the problem
[31:33] and these guys they were converted it
[31:35] says they were converted from alcohol
[31:37] and now they turn back and me being a
[31:40] preacher knowing the emotional stress
[31:42] that you go through as a pastor or
[31:43] preacher
[31:45] I can see why if they had nothing to
[31:46] hold him I can see why they would turn
[31:48] back to the very thing that must be the
[31:50] thing I need because I can't seem to
[31:51] relieve my nerves
[31:54] what a tragedy
[31:56] but he just turned back to the only
[31:58] thing he knew now he's preaching doing
[32:00] it
[32:03] we find out they are in that condition
[32:04] it's a degration and a reproach but no
[32:06] more a reproach than it would be to lie
[32:08] steal or lust after women
[32:13] or any other thing that's a command you
[32:15] see saying the same thing as me and that
[32:17] is that we should not be critical so
[32:20] critical of something like that we hear
[32:22] of something and now we're going to
[32:23] blast them and make them serpent seed
[32:25] right away unless we're researching and
[32:28] saying but Lord I'm going to pray for
[32:30] that man or that woman because it's no
[32:32] more a discretion or approach than a man
[32:34] that's lusting after women
[32:38] and it becomes more evident when a
[32:40] preacher does it when a preacher Falls
[32:41] by the three things preachers have big
[32:44] three Temptations to women to popularity
[32:47] and to money that's the big places that
[32:49] preachers fall and with two of those
[32:51] things we visibly see it it's a public
[32:53] thing that happens it goes out it's a
[32:55] public thing but for your lives usually
[32:57] it's not public
[32:58] not as much as a preacher
[33:01] so there's no sense in being critical of
[33:05] this man because we have to realize it's
[33:07] no different than lying or stealing
[33:09] lusting after women or any other thing
[33:10] that's in the Commandment he goes on see
[33:12] and maybe a man's Born High passion and
[33:15] he sees these modern stripteases on the
[33:17] street he's constantly in trouble you
[33:19] see he the man is born like that now
[33:21] what he ought to do the minister that
[33:22] drinks or the woman that smokes or
[33:25] dresses immorally trying to draw her a
[33:28] comfort from being so well put together
[33:29] that she wants to cause man to look at
[33:32] her she's feeling an emotional need
[33:36] or a soul need by dressing all fancy and
[33:41] sexy
[33:42] she's feeling a need to get that man to
[33:44] whistle at her
[33:45] get him to look towards her
[33:48] she's just like a alcoholic she's just
[33:50] like the gamer that sits for 30 years of
[33:53] his life in front of Gaming
[33:56] I need to get a bigger amen
[33:58] you're feeling an emotional thing that
[34:01] you're lacking that's supposed to be
[34:02] filled with almighty God
[34:07] the woman that smokes or dresses he's
[34:09] he's putting all this stuff together you
[34:11] notice that right she wants to cause
[34:13] that man to look at her there's no other
[34:15] reason she is partially insane
[34:18] you see no sensible woman will not just
[34:20] strip herself before a man that was her
[34:22] that was in her right mind see there's
[34:24] no reason for it at all and she but
[34:25] she's trying these young girls today
[34:27] that go out on the street
[34:29] well you excuse the expression remember
[34:31] this taped only just that's not just
[34:33] these people it goes around the world
[34:34] and a woman that will take her clothes
[34:36] off from her for she knows it's hotter
[34:38] walk out there in the sun naked and then
[34:40] walk out with the same some clothes on
[34:42] and which is the coolest the Indians
[34:44] down there in the papagos and navajos
[34:46] and the pop goes especially at the
[34:47] reservation those women come out with
[34:49] big yarn blankets around them and sit
[34:51] out there in the sun to keep cool why
[34:53] they perspire and the wind that blows
[34:55] sets up an air condition you see and
[34:56] these women have no other reason but
[34:57] Jess you realize the other sex the male
[35:00] sex looking upon such give such an
[35:02] influence to them until they'll squeak
[35:03] their tires and whistle at you the wolf
[35:05] whistle and what do they do for that
[35:07] that what do they do that for the woman
[35:09] does it in order to get the man to do
[35:11] that why do you get out right and
[35:13] remember he's talking about the
[35:14] comforter everybody needs a comforter
[35:15] we're looking for our comfort from
[35:16] somewhere
[35:18] women dressing Immortal she's looking
[35:20] for comfort
[35:21] a woman taking on makeup she's empty
[35:24] inside
[35:26] I'm saying it I'm saying it friends I'm
[35:29] quoting it you have to look at some need
[35:32] in your life that you're trying to
[35:34] fulfill by putting it making your face
[35:36] look different than the way God made it
[35:39] why do you get out there in the heat of
[35:41] the day at four o'clock in the afternoon
[35:42] to mow the grass with people are coming
[35:43] from their work and things it shows it's
[35:45] a spirit of insanity and I know many of
[35:47] them might have an IQ a million times
[35:49] higher than mine but I test your IQ with
[35:51] God's word and see where it comes out
[35:52] see that's modern IQ but the very
[35:54] evidence and fruits of the life proves
[35:56] so they try to find comfort with that
[35:58] many of them say well I don't do that
[36:00] but you I don't go out and do that in
[36:02] the beaches or whatever but you so dress
[36:04] themselves in such an appeal till they
[36:07] tried to be more modern than the woman
[36:09] that's going to sit by them in church
[36:12] the next morning
[36:17] competition who can dress the coolest in
[36:21] the church you know what you're doing
[36:22] you're you're trying to fulfill an
[36:25] emotional depletion
[36:32] sit by the church next word wear a
[36:34] better hat or a better clothes because
[36:36] you can't because you can afford to do
[36:38] it you see sin reaches way down
[36:43] and they try to find a comfort
[36:45] by doing so
[36:48] that's it for now
[36:50] so I wanted to read that because I've
[36:52] always enjoyed here saying you know what
[36:55] this man that's coming drunk to the
[36:57] pulpit
[36:59] there's something lacking and he's
[37:01] filling it with the wrong thing
[37:04] but no sense in being critical of him
[37:07] take a good look at our lives
[37:10] I'm a human being
[37:12] I get emotionally depleted
[37:14] trauma happens in my in my life in my
[37:17] wife it happens more in her than me
[37:19] because she has to live with me
[37:22] trauma happens in my wife
[37:29] trauma you you don't get over a trauma
[37:32] heading and that could be anything you
[37:33] could lose your job
[37:35] you could be a young person you could be
[37:37] bullied or belittled by somebody at
[37:39] school embarrassed at 10 years old
[37:41] you're embarrassed by a whole crowd of
[37:42] young people and they called you names
[37:44] you hardly get over that because our
[37:46] spirit doesn't do well with it it's a
[37:48] trauma to our spirit
[37:50] it can be as little as that or can be as
[37:52] big as a bankruptcy it could be big as
[37:54] losing your home you think job went
[37:56] through a little bit of trauma
[38:00] you think Joe's Spirit was affected yeah
[38:03] he was a little angry he was upset and
[38:05] just laying there and sackcloth and
[38:08] Ashes and just and he just you know
[38:11] angry and you know it's just he was a
[38:13] mess emotionally come on Friends
[38:16] the human Spirit cannot handle that
[38:18] stuff well and lost everything none of
[38:20] us has been where job has been
[38:23] yet and yet
[38:25] Satan's trying to take take him but
[38:28] there was a part Satan could never take
[38:31] and he knew that
[38:33] there's a part Satan could ever take
[38:35] never take from him
[38:36] and God knew it because at the big
[38:38] meeting with God God suggested job you
[38:41] can do anything you want to him thanks
[38:44] thank you Lord
[38:47] but it was the confidence in what was in
[38:50] job
[38:51] he's not going to deny me can you say
[38:54] Amen you can take him through anything
[38:56] he's going to come out of it somehow
[38:58] he's gonna rise again and you know why
[39:01] he knew he could rise again he says
[39:03] because I know my redeemer liveth
[39:06] and though the skin worms destroy this
[39:08] body yet in my flesh I shall see God I
[39:13] am a redeemer
[39:14] he'll rise again someday and because
[39:17] Heroes again I'm gonna rise out of any
[39:19] kind of trauma in my life somebody say
[39:21] praise the Lord I don't care what trauma
[39:24] hits my spirit I don't care what
[39:26] depression comes in my life
[39:28] Satan can't take this God that's within
[39:30] me
[39:32] [Applause]
[39:36] think he'd come to
[39:37] a trauma emotional down emotional low he
[39:40] came to it friends and so all these
[39:43] other areas that we turn to I know this
[39:46] is just a real
[39:47] in your face message but it's more Meek
[39:49] pondering these things
[39:51] it's more me pondering these things
[39:53] because I turn to
[39:55] things that are
[39:57] filling the emotional
[40:02] see when we dealt with some very deep
[40:04] things in the overcoming sexual
[40:06] Temptation class and I won't tell you
[40:09] all the things but it's very important
[40:10] for a man it's a godly man this day
[40:12] examine a bunch of things and look a lot
[40:15] of things
[40:15] you got to look at how God's made you as
[40:17] a man
[40:19] because Satan knows how God's made you
[40:21] he knows how you tick if you don't know
[40:22] how your brain works you're going to
[40:24] lose the battle
[40:26] come on you got to look at your enemy
[40:28] instead of your enemy his tactics
[40:31] first thing you got to have is go to
[40:33] prayer receive the holy spirit in your
[40:34] life
[40:35] that's the first thing
[40:37] these are all these things but one of
[40:39] the things you delve into is that lust
[40:42] is lust a failure is a failure a moral
[40:44] failure whatever it would be it's sin
[40:47] and sin it will be cruel to everything
[40:50] in your life will be taken away from you
[40:52] sin is never nice sin is never has a
[40:55] good result it's always going to end up
[40:57] bad
[40:58] sin is cruel
[41:01] but if you step back and say but where
[41:03] did this start
[41:05] why did I turn to this you're going to
[41:08] find that you were not meeting an
[41:10] emotional need
[41:11] in God
[41:15] so you chose something else
[41:18] he has to become the filler of our needs
[41:21] of all of our needs
[41:24] all of our life
[41:25] there's a scripture in Proverbs says let
[41:27] a man drink from his own fountain that
[41:29] God's provided for him it talks about
[41:31] his family talks about his wife it
[41:33] actually gets into the the the family
[41:36] relations sexual experience God gives
[41:39] you a fountain even for that to drink
[41:40] from and it's only meant to be fulfilled
[41:42] by the wife in a marriage
[41:45] young boys young girls it's only meant
[41:48] to be filled in one place and it's
[41:49] blessed by God that's in a marriage with
[41:51] one person for life
[41:53] it's not to be played with
[41:55] one person and until you find that Holy
[41:57] Ghost filled person then you leave that
[41:59] alone you say accuse it God let me put
[42:00] this and let me stay pure before you
[42:02] until you give me that one person this
[42:04] is only one place you don't play around
[42:06] there's only one place sexual
[42:08] fulfillment is pleasing to God and
[42:10] that's in a in a holy marriage
[42:13] so God even provides a fountain to drink
[42:16] from even for that
[42:18] he loves us but don't you ever think
[42:20] that God's not involved in providing for
[42:22] those things God provides for every one
[42:24] of your needs a fountain to drink from
[42:29] fountains that he's the great Fountain
[42:31] then he gives you a family then he gives
[42:33] you children then he gives you things
[42:35] that satisfy you then he gives you
[42:37] things that sent from him that will
[42:39] satisfy your emotional need
[42:42] instead of getting it somewhere else
[42:46] I want to go for a minute and I'm not
[42:48] going to get to all this today so I'll
[42:50] be mindful of the time
[42:51] but I want to go to Elijah and I know
[42:54] Elijah is a different
[42:56] a different bird because we realize his
[42:59] stress came from standing for the
[43:02] compromise of the church standing
[43:04] against Ahab standing against the
[43:07] prophets of Israel who were prophesying
[43:08] wrong influenced by Jezebel and standing
[43:11] against Jezebel breathing down his neck
[43:13] a woman was going after the man of God
[43:15] and so the reason I want to talk about
[43:18] because he hit such a low time after his
[43:20] high time he hit and the prophet says he
[43:23] had three stages to his journey and that
[43:27] was Mark Carmel when he called fire down
[43:30] and slew the prophets Supernatural he
[43:33] stood alone everybody against him he's
[43:34] still alone called fire down such a
[43:36] Mountaintop experience Mount Carmel then
[43:39] the second phase of his life was a
[43:40] Jupiter tree where he come out of that
[43:42] Mountaintop and he was there alone and
[43:45] Jezebel's breathing said I'm gonna if
[43:46] I'm gonna mark my words I'm gonna kill
[43:49] you for what you've done I'm coming
[43:50] after you so he goes into this
[43:52] depression and he's he comes to a
[43:54] juniper tree in his life five that he's
[43:57] just alone and he says God
[44:00] I don't even want to live just shoot me
[44:04] just in my life I don't want to go on
[44:07] anymore I'm finished and brother Brown
[44:09] elaborates on his depression and his his
[44:13] just just being completely so low that
[44:16] he just began to sleep it off he fell
[44:18] asleep and slept for for days
[44:21] I'll tell you sometimes that might be
[44:23] better for some of y'all than turn into
[44:24] all the other things you turn to
[44:28] sometimes people get angry and they're
[44:30] on edge because they just haven't got
[44:31] any rest lately
[44:36] slap it off and
[44:38] this is the juniper tree so he goes
[44:40] through a valley and then he comes to a
[44:43] cave experience without which will be
[44:45] our answer today the cave experience
[44:47] but going through the juniper tree it
[44:50] was pretty low he wanted to kill himself
[44:51] he was suicidal
[44:53] he wanted to see his life ended he was
[44:55] so low after this great Mountain there's
[44:57] one thing Christian's got to learn I
[44:59] wish that sir Inez was here I would have
[45:00] her sing the song I love her to sing it
[45:03] sister knows if you're listening I wish
[45:04] you'd have been here to sing this song
[45:05] the old song but the God on the mountain
[45:08] is still God in the valley
[45:13] and if you only like the god in the
[45:16] mountain and you're going to just travel
[45:17] to camp meetings and you only like to
[45:19] live on the emotional highs you haven't
[45:21] really got to know God in the valley yet
[45:24] and if you're going to grow in the Lord
[45:25] you have to know God in the valley
[45:27] because the same God that was in the
[45:30] emotional high can you say man is the
[45:32] same God that's with you
[45:35] in your lows and you cling to him
[45:38] you don't cling to some entertainment
[45:40] you don't cling to some relieving of
[45:42] your nurse if you have to do that
[45:43] medicine I'm not condemning that I'm
[45:45] just saying don't cling to that and not
[45:47] to God cling to God I don't understand
[45:49] anything right now I just want to see my
[45:51] life in please take me Lord take me home
[45:54] Henry has that song he wrote take me
[45:56] home take me home I have to play it to
[45:58] myself one time I have to play it
[46:00] because that's how you feel Lord just
[46:02] take me home
[46:03] end all of this I'm ready to go
[46:08] he's writing that because that's how you
[46:09] feel and there's no it's you know we
[46:12] talk so much about strength and brother
[46:14] Brown preached perfect strength to
[46:15] perfect weakness and he says this is a
[46:17] strange subject for the Pentecostals who
[46:19] are always talking about how strong they
[46:21] are
[46:22] boasting we're strong we're strong and I
[46:24] think that's good but yes in human human
[46:27] we're weak and God gets Glory when we're
[46:30] admitting that we're weak and that we
[46:32] cannot depend on anything else but God
[46:34] can you say Amen
[46:37] we're weak in ourselves and when we're
[46:39] weak then God can express his strength
[46:41] through our weakness
[46:45] it's humility to say I can't do this on
[46:48] my own and I'm not going to turn to
[46:49] something else to meet my emotional void
[46:52] turn into my God
[46:54] I'm you don't think other prophets and
[46:56] other people in the Bible Christ said
[46:57] I've been mistreated I've it's been it's
[47:00] unfair I'm in the hounds of hell are
[47:02] after me I've got a jezebel after me I
[47:05] don't know what it is but God I turn to
[47:07] you I will not turn to anything else I
[47:09] am emotionally unstable right now and
[47:12] I'm willing to admit it but God I'm
[47:14] staying right here until you answer and
[47:16] you come and you fill this need
[47:19] you feel my emotional instability you
[47:22] make me stable
[47:23] you stabilize it can I get an amen this
[47:25] morning
[47:27] praise the Lord and so Elijah here he
[47:29] comes into this state uh and I'll just
[47:33] let the prophet explain it and there's
[47:34] quite a bit here I might cut it off in
[47:35] the middle and we'll pick it up next
[47:36] week or whenever we can pick it up I
[47:38] hope you're getting something out of
[47:39] this this morning I the Lord I was still
[47:42] here till I prayed here in the sanctuary
[47:45] and I was still here crying out to God
[47:46] God what do you want me to say tomorrow
[47:48] morning I'm open Lord what it is just
[47:50] laying on the couch meditating in that
[47:53] office and God directly come and brought
[47:55] this Elijah and spoke to me said you say
[47:57] that in the morning to the people
[48:00] Elijah had a hard day he had been on
[48:02] Mount Carmel he had seen the glory of
[48:04] the Lord come down he had prayed fire
[48:05] out of heavens and then prayed rain down
[48:08] upon the Earth and under all this strain
[48:10] his nerves were about Broken Oh How I
[48:12] can feel for him and here we find him
[48:14] first preaching to a backsled nation of
[48:16] people and to a jezebel that wanted her
[48:19] way
[48:21] and the people had to come to a place
[48:23] that they had forsaken God for suck all
[48:24] his promises and all of his Commandments
[48:26] have no longer kept his statues and
[48:27] cared nothing for him it sounds like the
[48:30] world that we live in and Elijah in the
[48:31] midst of it all he could not compromise
[48:33] he had to stand true to his convictions
[48:34] and how that reflects in this day and
[48:37] they had a queen there by the name of
[48:38] Jezebel and she had let all the children
[48:40] of Israel stray with her modern
[48:41] fantastic way of living and I tell you
[48:43] Elijah and his nerves on the edge anyhow
[48:45] I always felt sorry for him his nerves
[48:47] was about ready to break anyhow and that
[48:49] great pound from Jezebel finished the
[48:51] stroke then he run and went into the
[48:53] Wilderness and laid under the juniper
[48:55] tree you know if you study your Bible
[48:57] you can see the kind of woman that
[48:58] Jezebel was she had her husband under
[49:01] her thumb and her control she had all
[49:03] the prophets in the church under control
[49:05] she had everybody leading them and the
[49:08] husband was bowing to her wouldn't
[49:09] wouldn't speak up she had everybody but
[49:11] she didn't have this man she didn't have
[49:13] this man of God
[49:15] and she thought that she could control
[49:17] him like she controls her husband
[49:21] she was calling the shots
[49:24] Jezebel's spirit
[49:27] but she come into a wrong way
[49:30] when she
[49:32] put her guns on the man of God
[49:35] that experience of the juniper tree
[49:37] there's many of us find ourselves under
[49:38] the junior tree I get myself under there
[49:40] many times to a place that you don't
[49:42] know what to do you're frustrated
[49:44] frankly I'm right under it now and
[49:46] wanting oh God what would you have me to
[49:48] do
[49:49] you know people under the juniper tree
[49:51] is like Elijah they like to sleep I
[49:53] preach to more tired people than anybody
[49:55] in the world
[49:57] people is so tired they're so mentally
[50:00] strained until they're filling the
[50:02] insane institutions and hospitals
[50:04] everywhere
[50:06] they're went in such a nervous condition
[50:08] until they don't know what they do
[50:10] believe and what they want they're just
[50:12] laying there they don't know what to do
[50:13] oh it's such a sad sight
[50:17] what year are we talking here
[50:20] 1959.
[50:24] such a sad sight I preached to more
[50:27] tired people
[50:28] that was 1959
[50:31] and so now he was preaching to tired
[50:34] people I preached the more sleeping
[50:35] people than I ever have in my life
[50:37] they've just gone to sleep now
[50:42] people are tired
[50:43] that we're out physically mentally
[50:48] and I just tell you sometimes it's just
[50:50] you're tired but sometimes you're
[50:52] bringing it on yourself
[50:55] there's no Sabbath in your life there's
[50:57] no rest in your life there's no selling
[51:00] down and meditating on God there's no
[51:02] spending an hour in his word everything
[51:04] else is more important
[51:07] had people pray for me pray I'm stressed
[51:09] out I don't know but a lot of it they
[51:10] bring on themselves
[51:14] I don't mean to preach on you that's why
[51:15] I'm preaching on myself we are
[51:17] physically mentally spiritually
[51:19] emotionally wore out in this generation
[51:22] we're going to have to have a better
[51:24] answer than the stuff that we turn to
[51:30] such a sad thing listen here my brother
[51:32] you can drink it off you can Shout It
[51:34] Off
[51:36] neither can you play cards till it's
[51:38] dull and you can take a thousand CSS and
[51:40] try to sleep it off and you can't do it
[51:42] all the little remedies only thing it
[51:44] does is help the symptoms
[51:47] we've got to have a cure for the disease
[51:49] we've got to have all the psychiatrists
[51:52] in the world cannot cure it it only
[51:53] helps the symptoms praise the Lord
[51:55] listen I'm not I'm going to balance it
[51:57] out I'm going to tell you brother Bram
[51:59] says God can heal by medicine God can
[52:01] heal by love it's the mystery how God
[52:04] can heal a person sometimes there's not
[52:06] one specific way that God would heal a
[52:08] person but when he heals you you give
[52:10] the glory to God
[52:12] he can heal by love he can live by you
[52:14] caring for a person they're hurting and
[52:16] you say I care for you I want to pray
[52:17] for you I want to encourage you just a
[52:18] little bit of love can heal that person
[52:20] but we give the glory to God so I'm not
[52:22] knocking how God can work through
[52:24] different ways I'm preaching against
[52:26] that becoming our all and not God
[52:32] care is in the blood of Jesus Christ not
[52:34] take a rest at the seashore not to get
[52:36] an Anthem you could go to all the
[52:39] greatest vacations in the world and I've
[52:40] been there and done that I've been to a
[52:41] lot of places in my early years and I
[52:44] tell young pastors this and young
[52:45] ministers if you go on vacation give
[52:47] yourself permission to have a vacation
[52:50] now I know that seems funny but people
[52:52] can take all of their stress and all
[52:54] their business and their phones and all
[52:56] of their things all they can take it all
[52:59] with them on vacation
[53:02] and the wife says oh I'm thankful we've
[53:04] got a vacation and you're all in another
[53:06] world on vacation because you haven't
[53:07] given yourself permission to have a
[53:08] vacation so I tell these pastors if you
[53:10] go do it what you need to do it give
[53:12] yourself permission to do it
[53:15] and be all there so the kids aren't
[53:16] recognizing dad never really left home
[53:19] he's he's out here looking it out of our
[53:21] window at the beach and he never really
[53:23] left home
[53:24] I you know why I'm preaching because I'm
[53:26] preaching myself I did it for years
[53:29] I felt guilty for taking a vacation
[53:32] I felt guilty for resting
[53:35] things are gonna
[53:36] these are gonna fall apart things are
[53:38] going to fall apart at home and I was
[53:39] worried about home and this and this
[53:41] and I had a pastor tell me I said how
[53:44] can you co-travel that much when you got
[53:45] your congregation home and you got
[53:46] things to work on help with people how
[53:49] can you go that long on vacation he goes
[53:51] he said well those problems will be
[53:53] there when I get back
[53:58] and I'm preaching on anybody here I'm
[54:00] just saying all of us have stress in our
[54:02] lives and we can take our stress with us
[54:03] on vacation
[54:07] because we don't know how to really rest
[54:10] and we don't know the place to find rest
[54:13] because we've been told can't be in my
[54:15] Bible can't be in the word can't be at
[54:18] church that's becoming a I'll tell you
[54:20] friends when church becomes an
[54:22] inconvenience
[54:24] when church becomes something we're
[54:26] afraid to come to
[54:28] I don't know what's happening there but
[54:30] I just think Satan's involved
[54:33] you need to be refreshed you need to
[54:35] forget the people you need to forget and
[54:37] say I'm coming to meet my God face to
[54:39] face I need this more than anything else
[54:41] in the world I'm hungry spiritually I'm
[54:43] hungry emotionally and this is the place
[54:45] I believe I'm gonna find it
[54:49] the cares in the blood Jesus Christ not
[54:51] take a rest not go to an Anthem acquire
[54:53] to sing anthems that's what we're trying
[54:54] to do today see now he's not knocking
[54:56] going to some Anthem or concert but he's
[54:58] just saying that's not the Cure
[55:01] that'll emotionally be a man those guys
[55:03] were great
[55:04] that's great
[55:07] it's not the Cure
[55:09] oh we'll make ourselves like the Joneses
[55:11] so that's another thing we feel our
[55:13] emotional need we got to make our house
[55:14] like the Joneses house next door we
[55:16] gotta dress like the Joneses we've got
[55:17] to be like the Josephs all you're doing
[55:18] is fulfilling an emotional depletion in
[55:20] your life you're doing it for the wrong
[55:22] reason and we're trying to do something
[55:24] different trying to educate it out
[55:25] there's only one way to do it that's
[55:26] face the fact that's right and if you're
[55:28] upset and frustrated don't join Church
[55:35] don't join a church come to Christ
[55:38] that's what you come to
[55:43] obviously somebody
[55:50] got to find the person of Jesus Christ
[55:55] your answer is not in literal life here
[55:57] can you say Amen your answer is not in
[55:59] some preacher some big preacher in the
[56:01] message you know if I just get to that
[56:03] oh what did we go somebody said about
[56:04] one Minister what are we gonna what are
[56:06] we gonna do when he's gone how will the
[56:08] bride what are we going to do in this
[56:09] Minister I won't mention his name I
[56:11] wouldn't do that but oh I don't know
[56:13] what we're going to do you know what
[56:14] we're going to do the Holy Ghost is
[56:16] going to raise up other ministers like
[56:17] that brother when he's dead
[56:20] God is going to preach to his people God
[56:23] is going to bring his people to a
[56:25] Rapture and it may not be all the big
[56:27] preachers in the message
[56:30] a bunch of them have died already and
[56:31] went to their reward can you say Amen
[56:33] I'm not dependent I'm not dependent on
[56:35] some Minister some one particular mister
[56:38] I'm dependent on the Holy Ghost
[56:39] providing a five-fold Ministry to bring
[56:41] me into a rapture
[56:45] see well I'm not dependent on I don't
[56:46] need preachers I don't really need when
[56:48] push comes to stop I don't really need
[56:49] to come here you don't really when the
[56:51] Bible says for the perfecting of the
[56:53] Saints for the work of the ministry
[56:54] you're not going to make it in a Rapture
[56:56] with just your Bible
[57:00] you're not going to rank it in the
[57:02] Rapture by just your tapes of brother
[57:03] banham at home and push and play you're
[57:06] not going to make it because God called
[57:08] a faithful Ministry to take that message
[57:10] and preach it to you every week
[57:13] [Applause]
[57:14] oh God
[57:16] doesn't use mechanical devices
[57:19] he has live Ministry he's provided
[57:22] and The Messengers that are in this day
[57:25] take that message that's preached to the
[57:26] seventh angel and keep preaching it to
[57:28] the people and by the way I preached
[57:30] that here I preach the message I'm
[57:31] quoting it right here
[57:33] you know the big office says you we you
[57:36] want to be in our mailing list do you
[57:38] push play do you play do you play enough
[57:41] for brother man you play brother man I
[57:42] said I said well
[57:44] we rarely play the tape itself but I
[57:46] know for 35 years I've quoted the
[57:49] seventh mentioned messenger almost every
[57:50] service
[57:51] why am I getting dumped out because I
[57:53] don't
[57:54] push play
[57:58] this is just another little beef I have
[58:02] sorry
[58:05] see
[58:06] you can take me off your mailing list I
[58:08] know what I've been preaching for 35
[58:10] years and it's not denominational Creeds
[58:13] and dogmas I don't get my sermons off
[58:15] some some pre-prepared sermon I feed on
[58:18] that Bible and the message of the
[58:20] seventh angel and I preach it to the
[58:22] people
[58:23] by the grace of God
[58:26] oh well we'll make ourselves like the
[58:28] Joneses that's it and if you're upset
[58:29] and frustrated don't join Church come to
[58:31] Christ many of us hit those places
[58:32] especially after a Mount Carmel
[58:34] experience it was asking me the other
[58:36] day by someone how that about how what
[58:38] would we what can we be done what can be
[58:40] done for us at this time there's only
[58:42] one thing that we can do and so someone
[58:44] is frustrated about something and
[58:46] they're saying brother and what are we
[58:47] going to do what do we there's some
[58:49] situations matter of fact it should be
[58:51] all of them here it is commit yourself
[58:53] when you are in a juniper there's only
[58:57] one thing that you can do Hold Steady
[58:59] and commit yourself to God
[59:02] I don't understand a clue what's
[59:04] happening right now I don't understand
[59:06] people I don't understand what just
[59:08] happened to me I don't understand the
[59:10] attack on my family I don't know what's
[59:12] going on Lord I'm being honest I don't
[59:13] know what's going on but I'm committed
[59:15] to you right now I'm committed I'm
[59:17] stable with you right now
[59:19] I'm not moving anywhere I'm not going
[59:21] anywhere
[59:24] the only thing we can do is commit
[59:26] ourselves to God during the juniper
[59:27] trees I'm committed I don't know what's
[59:30] going to happen but I know something's
[59:32] going to happen but right now I'm just
[59:33] committed to God
[59:37] I'm not going to binge on
[59:40] a television series
[59:46] I'm not gonna
[59:50] play video games
[59:52] for the next 48 hours to relieve my
[59:55] nerves
[59:58] don't make me the enemy I'm just the
[1:00:00] messenger
[1:00:03] come on now
[1:00:05] I'm not going to go back to that romance
[1:00:07] novel because I'm going through this
[1:00:08] trauma right now I'm not going back to
[1:00:10] that romance novel series that's been on
[1:00:12] maybe it's been on the shelf for years
[1:00:14] but I'm bringing it back out because I
[1:00:15] remember I got I got it just caught my
[1:00:18] nerves so I'm going to read about Sally
[1:00:21] and Ted
[1:00:24] and they they were really you know
[1:00:27] and you know they're hurting lives and
[1:00:30] they come together and it's just they
[1:00:33] were everything and they lived happily
[1:00:34] ever after and it just I don't know what
[1:00:36] it does but just it just caused my
[1:00:38] nerves just to read that story
[1:00:43] trial you're going through is a little
[1:00:44] bit more serious than that
[1:00:47] you'll need a soap opera to answer to
[1:00:50] needs that are in your family
[1:00:53] it's not real soap Opera's not real need
[1:00:56] something real is anybody listening to
[1:00:58] me this morning
[1:01:00] I'm gonna commit myself to God right
[1:01:02] here
[1:01:03] what about fishing and all that well I
[1:01:05] can't preach against fishing
[1:01:10] is Tom here I couldn't do that
[1:01:15] because we catch one every now and then
[1:01:17] every few years we catch a fish
[1:01:21] I keep wondering what's wrong and I'm
[1:01:22] thinking it's him
[1:01:26] there are things that do relax us and
[1:01:29] that's why brother Branson he's going to
[1:01:30] say it here he said I'll go hunting and
[1:01:33] because I'm under stress and he said but
[1:01:35] Ben people will I'll hear the criticism
[1:01:37] look at that preacher going and taking
[1:01:39] all that time off and hunting
[1:01:41] you see there I'm not preaching against
[1:01:44] things sometimes that would relax us but
[1:01:48] we cannot we cannot make that the the
[1:01:51] fill all
[1:01:53] for being depleted emotionally
[1:01:56] you can't we can't do it
[1:01:58] because then you go with me and brother
[1:02:00] Tom and you're thinking that if I get
[1:02:02] enough fish it'll emotionally settle me
[1:02:05] and then you get disappointed
[1:02:09] that's not all that bad with brother Tom
[1:02:11] we've
[1:02:12] we do pretty good
[1:02:15] it's those it's those
[1:02:17] Japanese guys in the next boat
[1:02:20] 20 feet away
[1:02:22] that's real and a man
[1:02:24] 20 feet away
[1:02:28] it's another beef I'm bringing out right
[1:02:30] now
[1:02:33] God's favoring them for some reason
[1:02:43] okay it's quarter to one I gotta end
[1:02:45] here
[1:02:46] I got to get to the answer here he comes
[1:02:48] into the cave
[1:02:52] commit yourself to God now I know a man
[1:02:53] that can overwork himself and a man can
[1:02:55] under work himself a man God know this
[1:02:57] man needed feeding he needed something
[1:02:59] to eat and under that place there where
[1:03:00] he was laying God had to do something
[1:03:01] for him God has to do something for
[1:03:03] every man that comes under the juniper
[1:03:04] tree notice God has to do something and
[1:03:06] he'll go to pieces or he'll go to Pieces
[1:03:09] he has to do it if his servant is laying
[1:03:11] under the tree Yonder don't know what to
[1:03:13] do he's carried out his commission
[1:03:14] Elijah said oh Lord let me die I've had
[1:03:16] those feelings after I come out of the
[1:03:18] meeting and looked like I have tried and
[1:03:20] preached and begged and persuaded and
[1:03:22] seen the angel of God sweep through a
[1:03:23] meeting and do signs and wonders and sit
[1:03:26] in the car on the outside and hear them
[1:03:27] cry and say that wasn't nothing but
[1:03:29] psychology
[1:03:31] there's nothing to it nothing to that
[1:03:33] that's all nonsense so it doesn't end
[1:03:36] Great Mighty meeting of God
[1:03:39] and there's still pressure from the
[1:03:41] enemy criticism you're not going to get
[1:03:43] out of life without criticism
[1:03:45] young people you're going to be bullied
[1:03:46] you're going to be criticized
[1:03:48] you're going to be made fun of and
[1:03:49] things are going to be unfair but you
[1:03:51] have a God that can see you through all
[1:03:53] of it
[1:03:54] you cling to God
[1:03:57] oh when I crawl under the jewelry I
[1:03:59] think Lord did you why did you let me do
[1:04:01] it what can I what can be done but we
[1:04:03] all hit those experiences but the mercy
[1:04:05] of Jehovah to his servant God knows your
[1:04:07] trials just know this he knows all about
[1:04:09] it so he comes down and he knows his
[1:04:11] servant needs some rest so he just puts
[1:04:12] him to sleep for a little while while
[1:04:14] he's laying there waiting for to
[1:04:15] recuperate praying to die Lord my
[1:04:17] father's died before me and now take my
[1:04:19] life I've done enough I've fought the
[1:04:21] good fight I've finished the course but
[1:04:22] there was a work to be done yet God
[1:04:24] wasn't through with his prophet he still
[1:04:26] had work no matter how much we cry out
[1:04:28] and think that that this that or the
[1:04:30] other nothing can take us until God is
[1:04:32] finished with us I'm so glad to know
[1:04:35] that
[1:04:36] you want to see at the end of that but
[1:04:38] see the very reason you're still here is
[1:04:40] God still has a purpose for your life
[1:04:42] God still has something for you to do
[1:04:45] can you say man Hallelujah sometimes you
[1:04:48] feel like as I did one time put a pistol
[1:04:50] against my head to commit suicide but I
[1:04:52] couldn't do it I took my glove off to
[1:04:54] lay it on a high voltage line where I
[1:04:55] was working but I couldn't do it
[1:04:57] something still had the same God that
[1:04:59] was with Elijah the same God that same
[1:05:01] God today he's seen me under the juniper
[1:05:04] tree God sees us under the juniper trees
[1:05:10] my wife and my baby lay under in the
[1:05:12] grave and my dad and my brother-in-law
[1:05:13] and all I was just about gone myself
[1:05:15] I've laid under the jewelry it's hard
[1:05:17] and I've got to a place I was so beside
[1:05:18] myself I tried to take a gun and shoot
[1:05:20] my brains out it wouldn't do good do it
[1:05:22] you see there's work yet to be done
[1:05:24] something has to be done God wasn't
[1:05:25] finished he'll always take care of you
[1:05:27] poor tired weary servant he saw him he
[1:05:30] know where he was he knows where you're
[1:05:32] at tonight you may be under a juniper
[1:05:34] tree everything gone but remember he
[1:05:36] knows where you're at we don't need a
[1:05:38] whole lot of re-fixing up like the old
[1:05:40] colored woman I kept this in because I
[1:05:41] loved it down in the South she had an
[1:05:43] accident a car hit her and it hurt her
[1:05:45] pretty bad and the lawyer said do you
[1:05:46] want to sue for damages lost in Mercy no
[1:05:49] honey said I haven't I have enough
[1:05:51] damage I want some repair
[1:05:57] Hallelujah I got enough damage I need
[1:06:00] some repair I need some healing in my
[1:06:03] life this morning
[1:06:06] see suing somebody's to get back at them
[1:06:09] for the damage we don't do that
[1:06:13] no we cry out to our God
[1:06:15] say God I need some healing and repair
[1:06:18] find out that he was 40 days and 40
[1:06:20] nights God located him standing pulling
[1:06:21] him back in the cave and God wanted to
[1:06:24] attract this tension so now he moves to
[1:06:26] the cave God moved him he fed him some
[1:06:28] he when he woke up he seen some cakes
[1:06:31] cooking there that God had put for him
[1:06:33] some cake cooking and a a thing of water
[1:06:35] fresh water beside him and he said get
[1:06:37] up and eat and he just where'd all that
[1:06:39] come from came from God
[1:06:42] God has the food you need
[1:06:44] God provides just what you need for
[1:06:46] nourishment during your juniper tree get
[1:06:48] up and eat he gets up and eats it all
[1:06:49] and then he falls back to sleep for
[1:06:51] another few days
[1:06:52] when he wakes up there's another cake
[1:06:54] there there's another thing of water
[1:06:55] finally when he gets his strength up he
[1:06:57] gets up he moves him to this cave and
[1:06:59] I'm closing I promise God wanted to
[1:07:01] attract us it is there was a great storm
[1:07:02] passed by and it rent the mountains it
[1:07:04] was so powerful till it shook the Rocks
[1:07:06] but God wasn't in the storm it went
[1:07:08] before God
[1:07:09] did and then there come a great
[1:07:11] earthquake that shook the Earth but
[1:07:12] still God wasn't in the earthquake and
[1:07:14] there come a fire but God wasn't in the
[1:07:16] fire and then there came a still Small
[1:07:17] Voice and God was where God was in a
[1:07:22] still small voice
[1:07:26] I just brought you the answer
[1:07:29] his still small voice isn't gone
[1:07:32] but we can't hear it because life has
[1:07:35] become so noisy
[1:07:37] but it's here and interesting it's
[1:07:40] called a still
[1:07:43] small
[1:07:46] I think that's intentional
[1:07:48] I think it's to teach us something
[1:07:50] because nothing's still in our lives
[1:07:54] nothing small in our lives the trauma's
[1:07:56] small anymore they're big traumas
[1:07:59] the voices and noise we hear are loud
[1:08:01] noises everywhere
[1:08:03] but when we find his it'll be a still
[1:08:05] small voice
[1:08:08] and he says I I have been in the
[1:08:10] earthquake I have been in the storm I've
[1:08:13] been in a lot of things but in this time
[1:08:15] in your life right
[1:08:17] you'll find me in a still small voice
[1:08:23] brother sister I've been back in a cave
[1:08:25] long enough and you know to know that
[1:08:27] there's been a lot of earthquakes
[1:08:28] shaking around a lot of noise and fusses
[1:08:31] and stews and things like that and big
[1:08:32] meetings and where has God been out of
[1:08:34] it there's the reason that's the reason
[1:08:36] I said this morning there's got to come
[1:08:38] something deeper than a healing service
[1:08:43] freedom
[1:08:45] are we against them no
[1:08:47] but there's got to come something deeper
[1:08:49] even
[1:08:50] than a physical healing service
[1:08:55] there's got to something something
[1:08:56] deeper than healing service there's got
[1:08:57] to come something deeper than a gift to
[1:08:59] speak with tongues there's got to be
[1:09:00] something deeper than a rushing Mighty
[1:09:01] wind the wind went forth but God wasn't
[1:09:03] in it we've had rushing Mighty winds all
[1:09:05] over the country and Sensations and
[1:09:06] blood in the face and in the hands all
[1:09:08] kinds of signs but where is God at and
[1:09:10] all the great fuss in America is guilty
[1:09:11] of listening to those noises we love
[1:09:13] noise but God is not in the noise
[1:09:15] although as honorable and thing as that
[1:09:17] we are yet God isn't in the noise if
[1:09:19] that would have been so when the
[1:09:21] Africans beat the tomtoms you never
[1:09:23] heard such a noise in Rhythm God wasn't
[1:09:24] in it and we've had rushing Mighty winds
[1:09:26] we've had all kinds of fires and
[1:09:27] earthquakes and shakings and great
[1:09:29] revivals and things like that God wasn't
[1:09:31] in it if it had been it would have
[1:09:33] showed itself up but after that come a
[1:09:36] still Small Voice then God was in The
[1:09:40] Voice
[1:09:42] somebody said praise the Lord
[1:09:45] God was in the still Small Voice God was
[1:09:49] in The Voice
[1:09:52] it's here friends it's here
[1:09:54] and when Jesus said
[1:09:56] be careful that your hearts become
[1:09:58] overburdened and depressed
[1:10:01] by all this around you and your emotions
[1:10:03] are depleted
[1:10:06] you know all that pressure was in direct
[1:10:09] resistance and conflict to the scripture
