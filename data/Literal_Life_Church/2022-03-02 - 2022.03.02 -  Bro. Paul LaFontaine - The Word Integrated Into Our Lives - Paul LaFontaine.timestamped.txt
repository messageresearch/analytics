[0:00] deuteronomy chapter 6 together
[0:02] deuteronomy chapter 6 back in
[0:05] god's instructions to
[0:08] the children of israel after they had
[0:10] received the word
[0:11] then they received in deuteronomy 6 many
[0:13] instructions
[0:14] but this is a unique thing tonight that
[0:16] i want to talk a little bit about
[0:18] um
[0:19] and this will tie back a bit into our
[0:22] study on psalms 1
[0:24] on the thought life and these different
[0:26] things but i wanted to get into this a
[0:27] few weeks ago and i just didn't have the
[0:29] opportunity deuteronomy chapter 6
[0:32] and we'll start at verse 1
[0:34] and we'll just break down some of these
[0:36] scriptures tonight
[0:37] in a teaching so that we can be
[0:39] encouraging the lord in our journey with
[0:41] the lord
[0:42] and may god bless all those who are here
[0:44] tonight those that are listening may it
[0:46] go forth may the word go forth amen
[0:49] these are the commandments the statues
[0:51] and the judgments what's the lord and by
[0:53] the way i just want to say before i get
[0:54] into the anointing here before i think
[0:57] brother kenny being our
[1:00] choir director it's your birthday
[1:01] tomorrow right
[1:03] friday happy birthday brother kenny
[1:06] sister tiffany is tomorrow and there's
[1:08] somebody else too
[1:10] hannah slack did she's gone as well so
[1:13] they missed out on the pastor's
[1:15] appreciation birthday
[1:17] if you're listening hannah god bless you
[1:19] and sister tiffany god bless you happy
[1:21] birthday
[1:22] amen now these are the commandments
[1:25] the statues
[1:27] the judgments which the lord your god
[1:29] commanded to teach you
[1:30] that ye might do them in the land
[1:32] whether you go to possess it
[1:35] so
[1:36] the statues and judgments of what he's
[1:38] referring to is what came down from the
[1:40] mountain from moses god's prophet
[1:42] at mount horeb or
[1:45] another reference is mount sinai it's
[1:47] both it's the same thing but this is a
[1:49] significant point in history for god
[1:52] coming to his people and speaking
[1:54] through his prophet and what came from
[1:56] god is the word of god in statutes and
[1:58] judgments and how to live and here it
[2:00] says
[2:01] when you go in to possess the land
[2:03] you're going to need these principles
[2:04] you're going to need these statues
[2:07] because when they went into the land
[2:08] when they'd crossed into the wilderness
[2:10] to give them that's when the battle
[2:11] really begun i've often said your battle
[2:14] doesn't begin until you get the holy
[2:15] ghost that's when the battle really
[2:17] begins
[2:18] and you enter the land and you begin
[2:20] battling for your possession
[2:22] well his statutes instructions were for
[2:25] to prepare them because he says you're
[2:27] going to need these things that my
[2:28] prophet is saying you're going to need
[2:30] them when you get into the land and more
[2:32] every day you're going to need them even
[2:34] more
[2:35] so he says keep those statues and then
[2:38] he as you watch out as he goes along in
[2:40] the scripture
[2:42] that thou mightest fear the lord thy god
[2:44] to keep all his statues and his
[2:46] commandments which i command thee thou
[2:48] and thy son and thy son son that means
[2:51] your grandson
[2:52] all the days of thy life and that thy
[2:54] days may be prolonged hear therefore
[2:57] israel and observe to do it that it may
[2:59] be well with thee and that ye may
[3:01] increase mightily there's always a
[3:03] promise of god a blessing that goes from
[3:05] following the word it's always there as
[3:08] the lord god of our fathers hath
[3:09] promised thee in the land that floweth
[3:11] with milk and honey hero is where the
[3:13] lord our god is one lord and thou shalt
[3:15] love the lord thy god with all thine
[3:18] heart and with all thy soul and with all
[3:20] thy might
[3:22] another place jesus references that he
[3:23] said with all thy mind as well sort of
[3:26] pretty much covers the whole human being
[3:29] if you're going to love god then be all
[3:31] in and love them with everything
[3:33] don't just give them your heart give
[3:34] them your mind don't just give them your
[3:38] don't just give one part of yourself but
[3:41] give your heart give your soul and give
[3:43] your might get it give everything that's
[3:45] the only way to really truly love god is
[3:48] to give them your all a lot of people
[3:49] today is probably not a person in the
[3:51] world you wouldn't ask in the world say
[3:53] do you love god everybody would say yes
[3:55] but it has actions to it
[3:58] and when you do it you don't love him
[4:00] and pick which parts you want of god
[4:02] you're all in and part of loving god of
[4:05] course is that what he said before
[4:07] you're embracing his statues and his
[4:09] commandments and these things that's
[4:11] part of loving god but look how he says
[4:12] this now thou shalt love the lord thy
[4:14] god with all thine heart with all thy
[4:16] soul with all thy might and these words
[4:18] which i command thee this day shall be
[4:21] in thine heart
[4:22] so so these words that i'm saying
[4:25] and that i brought through my prophet
[4:27] and spoke them these principles these
[4:29] commandments this word that i've given
[4:31] you to live by
[4:33] was never meant to stay just in the head
[4:36] it must be in your heart
[4:39] these words which i command you this day
[4:41] shall be in thine heart
[4:44] god takes it further what do i do with
[4:46] this word that i've received from a
[4:48] prophet
[4:49] let it love the lord
[4:51] let your obedience be out of love
[4:55] okay
[4:56] first let it start i just love god with
[4:58] all my heart soul mind and strength
[5:00] a new person says i don't know very much
[5:02] yet but i want to learn i just know i
[5:04] love god with all my heart so much start
[5:06] there
[5:07] and then make sure it's not not just in
[5:09] your head and say i want to love him
[5:10] from my heart
[5:12] but you're not done there what do i do
[5:13] with this lord will you love him with
[5:15] all your heart you make sure the word is
[5:16] in their heart not just in your head
[5:19] what do i do with this word okay next
[5:21] one and thou shalt teach them diligently
[5:24] unto thy children and shall talk of them
[5:26] when thou sittest in nine house
[5:29] and when thou walkest by the way and
[5:31] when thou liest down and when thou
[5:33] riseth up what i gave through the
[5:36] prophet should be the topic of
[5:38] conversation
[5:41] not only at church but in your home
[5:44] these things that i've said through him
[5:46] talk about them
[5:47] say things in front of your children
[5:49] talk about the scripture talk about
[5:51] world events and talk about how
[5:53] talk about god and his principles and
[5:55] his precepts can you say man
[5:57] this is what we talk about i know we
[5:59] talk about other things at home we have
[6:00] to you know
[6:01] how to pay for this and how to you know
[6:04] go change johnny's diaper and all kinds
[6:06] of other conversations but if it's all
[6:08] about just life then we're missing the
[6:10] power
[6:11] of living
[6:13] and this he's saying this you know why
[6:15] he's saying this because this is hard
[6:18] for us humans to do
[6:21] okay this will be a battle just to bring
[6:24] the word integrated into our lives
[6:27] but the problem is if we don't bring the
[6:29] word integrated he's going to tell us
[6:31] later what's going to happen
[6:33] so it's very important that we do it
[6:35] with all of life to integrate the word
[6:37] into into our hearts
[6:39] brother paul are you going to let us
[6:41] stand the whole time you preach to verse
[6:43] 14
[6:45] yes i am because i have to stand the
[6:47] whole service zack you know that right
[6:51] okay let's go further and thou shalt
[6:52] bind them for a sign upon thine hand and
[6:55] they shall be as frontlets between thine
[6:57] eyes and thou shalt write them upon the
[7:00] post of thy house and on thy gates and
[7:02] it shall be when the lord thy god shall
[7:04] have brought thee into the land which he
[7:06] swear and thy fathers to abraham to
[7:08] isaac to jacob to give thee great and
[7:10] goodly cities which thou build us not
[7:13] and houses full of all good things which
[7:15] thou fill us not and wells dig which
[7:17] thou dig us not vineyards and olive
[7:19] trees which thou planets not when thou
[7:21] hast have eaten and you're full
[7:24] then be aware
[7:25] beware
[7:27] lest thou forget the lord
[7:30] prosperity
[7:32] and things handed to you
[7:34] has a downside to it
[7:36] you forget the lord
[7:38] and you forget to talk about the lord in
[7:40] front of your children you forget to
[7:42] integrate it into your house you forget
[7:44] to pray
[7:45] and that can happen it's not like you
[7:47] intentionally do it it just happens
[7:49] naturally
[7:51] beware lest thou forget the lord which
[7:53] brought thee forth out of the land of
[7:55] egypt from the house of bondage thou
[7:56] shalt fear the lord thy god and serve
[7:58] him and shall swear by his name
[8:01] ye shall not go after other gods of the
[8:03] gods of the people which are round about
[8:05] you
[8:06] for the lord thy god is a jealous god
[8:08] among you lest the anger of the lord thy
[8:09] god be kindled against thee and destroy
[8:11] thee from off the face of the earth you
[8:13] shall not tempt the lord your god as he
[8:15] as ye tempted him in massa ye shall dead
[8:18] dylan and you remember that temptation
[8:20] in the wilderness god didn't like it at
[8:22] all because they were tempting and how
[8:24] are they tempting the lord they begin
[8:26] the question
[8:27] is the lord among us or not
[8:30] that's how they tempted the lord they
[8:31] began to question if the lord was even
[8:33] around
[8:34] oh god just gets so grieved over that
[8:36] how can you say that with all that's to
[8:38] happen in our lives how can you say that
[8:41] with all the supernatural things
[8:43] never say that never tempt the lord is
[8:45] he even around us or not he's around us
[8:49] he's present can you say amen
[8:51] and ye shall diligently keep the
[8:53] commandments of the lord your god which
[8:54] is testimonies and his statues which he
[8:57] hath commanded thee
[8:59] wait a minute no wait verse 13 thou
[9:01] shalt fear the lord thy god serve him
[9:03] you shall not go after other gods the
[9:04] gods of the people which are round about
[9:06] you verse 15 for the lord thy god is a
[9:08] jealous god among you lest the anger of
[9:10] the lord be kindled against thee and
[9:11] destroy thee from off the face of the
[9:13] earth you shall not tempt the lord your
[9:15] god as you tempted him and massa ye
[9:17] shall diligently keep the commandments
[9:18] of the lord your god and his testimonies
[9:21] and his statues
[9:23] which he hath commanded thee thou shalt
[9:25] do that which right and good in the
[9:26] sight of the lord that it may be well
[9:28] with thee and that thou mayest go and
[9:30] possess the good land which the lord
[9:32] swear unto thy fathers to cast out all
[9:36] thine enemies from before thee as the
[9:38] lord has spoken amen father bless your
[9:41] word tonight we're very happy to be here
[9:44] and any troubles that we have in our
[9:46] life we can shut it out and we know you
[9:48] are the god that gives us the hallelujah
[9:51] in the valley
[9:53] we commit ourselves to you tonight all
[9:55] the prayer requests and our dear
[9:57] brothers and sisters in ukraine and
[9:58] russia we commit them to you for
[10:01] protection over them tonight in jesus
[10:04] name amen god bless you may be seated
[10:07] so this ties back to psalms chapter 1
[10:10] verse 2
[10:11] where the man of god is his delight this
[10:14] will tie back to what i was talking to a
[10:15] couple weeks ago about these things
[10:18] his delight is in the word he does
[10:20] meditate day and night
[10:22] that the thought life saturated with the
[10:24] word and positive things
[10:26] brings victory and stability no matter
[10:29] what happens
[10:30] i want to title this tonight the word
[10:32] integrated into our lives
[10:35] the word
[10:36] because it's not that we just have the
[10:38] word
[10:39] it's not just god sent a prophet with
[10:41] the word
[10:43] in these scriptures it says the word
[10:45] must be integrated into your life
[10:48] and when i preached on the thought life
[10:50] that's what that man did he
[10:52] in his law he doth meditate day and
[10:54] night he directs his thoughts to come
[10:56] always back to the word of god there's a
[10:58] lot of things we can think about but he
[11:00] directs his thought and he disciplines
[11:01] his thought bringing him back to the
[11:03] word thinking of a scripture thinking of
[11:05] a precept thinking of something brother
[11:06] braham said thinking of something moses
[11:08] said back then it was moses think of it
[11:10] and they would always discipline their
[11:11] mind because that's what that man of god
[11:13] did that was blessed he meditated on day
[11:15] and night he was his delight but it
[11:17] wasn't just that i love the word and i
[11:18] like the lord i love the word but he
[11:20] meditated on he discipline his mind say
[11:22] i'm gonna i have a choice of my thoughts
[11:25] i have a choice what i'm gonna think
[11:27] about every day
[11:28] and so if i have the choice in it i
[11:30] don't have a choice in a lot of things
[11:32] but if i have a choice i'm going to
[11:34] choose what i'm going to think about
[11:36] how many knows the new testament
[11:37] scripture that says
[11:39] think on these things
[11:41] instructions whatsoever is good report
[11:43] whatsoever is lovely whatsoever is pure
[11:46] not dirty
[11:48] what sort of a good report not bad
[11:49] report not gossip
[11:52] and i'm given my mind and the rest gets
[11:54] trashed and i'm giving mind to good
[11:55] things i choose to think on these things
[11:58] and we know the power of that and so now
[12:00] that thought life being saturated with
[12:03] the word and positive things brings
[12:05] victory and stability no matter what
[12:08] happens in our life it counters
[12:10] everything a thought life that is given
[12:12] to god counters everything that's going
[12:15] on the fears of coming judgments your
[12:18] internal fears your personal fears your
[12:21] fears of the future your fears that you
[12:22] might get the same genetic disease that
[12:25] your whole family
[12:26] uh four generations back has gotten your
[12:29] fears of the coming judgments your fears
[12:31] are what's happening in the world
[12:34] it is the counter the thought life being
[12:36] being
[12:37] uh pleasant under the pleasant thoughts
[12:39] of god your thought life counters all
[12:42] things and it brings victory in your
[12:44] life it brings stability in your life
[12:47] it counters the fears it counters the
[12:50] spirit of laodicea
[12:52] which is a lukewarm spirit a thought
[12:54] life under control of god filled with
[12:56] the spirit
[12:57] counters the spirit of laodicea and
[13:00] makes you on fire for god instead of
[13:02] lukewarm for god
[13:04] that's why how powerful this thought
[13:05] life is um it brings the hallelujah in
[13:08] the body your thought life under control
[13:10] brings the hallelujah in the valley
[13:12] we must stay close to the lord that's
[13:15] what these scriptures say and our world
[13:17] must stay close to his world god's world
[13:20] our world must stay integrated with the
[13:23] things of god if not integrated
[13:26] saturated when the the bible talks about
[13:30] take this truth put it on the doorpost
[13:32] of your house teach it in the morning
[13:34] and night to your children put it in put
[13:36] it in the frontlets of your eyes that
[13:38] means saturate your life with the word
[13:41] of god now there's a reason why he's
[13:43] saying that and i'm going to give those
[13:45] reasons tonight tonight maybe next
[13:46] wednesday i'm going to give the reason
[13:47] because god always has a good reason why
[13:49] he's saying it but the main theme
[13:51] tonight is that it's not just that you
[13:53] have the word is it integrated into your
[13:55] life and into your thought life
[13:58] because when you get it then you get
[13:59] victory so our we must stay close
[14:02] and our world must stay integrated with
[14:04] the thinks of god if not saturated with
[14:07] the things of god and the principles of
[14:09] god if not
[14:10] the spirit of the age can dominate us
[14:13] even believers can get us in a state of
[14:16] lukewarmness
[14:19] even the church
[14:21] we know the laodicean church it's the
[14:23] church he's talking about in revelation
[14:24] street it's not unbelievers can you say
[14:26] amen it's the church that's in a state
[14:29] of lukewarmness so that means that
[14:31] believers if they're not countering
[14:33] saying god i want to stay on fire for
[14:35] you i want to stay close to you
[14:38] if you don't fight against that you'll
[14:40] automatically become a laodicean
[14:43] i don't mean to call the bride laoseans
[14:45] tonight but i have to be honest that if
[14:47] we don't yield to god we come under
[14:49] lukewarmness and god hates that he wants
[14:51] to spill it out of his mouth he would
[14:53] rather have you cold he'd rather make a
[14:55] decision so many people right now are in
[14:56] the valley of decision they're they're
[14:58] making decisions what to do right now
[15:00] whether to follow the council of god or
[15:02] follow their feelings and so many is in
[15:04] the valley of decision and so when
[15:06] you're in the in between spot it's a
[15:08] terrible place to be and when you become
[15:11] lukewarm in your walk with the lord god
[15:13] says i would really rather have you cold
[15:15] or hot but i i the lukewarmness is what
[15:19] makes me spill it out of my mouth i
[15:21] can't stand that lukewarm water coming
[15:23] from the church
[15:26] my dad used to say there's nothing worse
[15:28] when you're a kid and you're thirsting
[15:29] after playing an hour of basketball and
[15:31] you run up to a drinking fountain
[15:36] and it's lukewarm water
[15:39] nothing worse than good hot water for
[15:41] tea praise the lord nice ice water
[15:43] praise the lord but when you're hot and
[15:45] you need something lukewarm you just
[15:47] what do you do
[15:49] [Music]
[15:52] that's my demonstration tonight that's
[15:54] my visual
[15:56] it's what god says he does with our
[15:58] lives that become lukewarm
[16:01] i would rather have you cold i'd rather
[16:03] have you just admit i'm cold i'm i'm
[16:05] backslid i'm you know i'm making a
[16:08] decision i don't want this i want the
[16:10] world he would rather someone be honest
[16:12] than than to be in between
[16:15] god wants to see passion god wants to
[16:18] see the fires of the holy spirit god
[16:20] wants to see us trying we're not perfect
[16:23] but we're trying can you say amen your
[16:25] love of god comes natural my love of god
[16:28] comes natural if god puts his love
[16:30] within you you don't have to work at
[16:31] that but staying on fire for god you got
[16:34] to work at it you got to fight for it
[16:36] can you say amen you got to bring your
[16:38] heart and your passion underneath god
[16:42] to stay on fire
[16:44] you got to stay close to the fire
[16:47] [Music]
[16:49] amen
[16:50] if you want to get on fire you stay
[16:52] close to the fire
[16:54] and you're not distancing yourself from
[16:56] where the fires of god are which is in
[16:58] the word of god around the saints of god
[17:01] can you say man so you know it's
[17:05] it's several good quotes today that
[17:08] we're talking about
[17:10] uh people being critical of the
[17:12] the rude people at church
[17:15] and somebody posted
[17:17] these are the same people that talk
[17:18] about all the rude people at church that
[17:21] never stay after to find out who the
[17:23] people really are
[17:25] to know if they're rude or not
[17:28] amen
[17:30] and then there's the type of people
[17:31] that's the
[17:33] the the drag racers brother
[17:35] magoolus says
[17:38] i love it he says
[17:40] there's some christians that are drag
[17:41] racers
[17:42] they drag themselves to church and then
[17:44] they race away
[17:46] i love it i love it
[17:49] the problem is i see it
[17:54] i tell you we ought to
[17:55] come early and stay late can you say man
[17:57] we're going to come and get what we need
[17:59] to get praise the lord i want to don't
[18:01] want to be a drag racer for sure
[18:04] naturally and spiritually
[18:07] so in this lukewarm age
[18:10] this is a powerful weapon against it
[18:12] those who want to stay on fire
[18:14] they stay close to the fires of god and
[18:17] and so if how many want to live above
[18:19] laodicea how many want to how many wants
[18:21] to be on fire not a lukewarm christian
[18:23] amen so i think if you'll listen tonight
[18:25] there'll be some things i guarantee you
[18:27] that would be a help to you if you
[18:28] listen close you'll hear some good
[18:30] things other people just filter it out
[18:32] uh to what you want to hear like you
[18:34] normally do
[18:35] so now
[18:37] in this setting of deuteronomy just in
[18:39] case you don't know
[18:41] we're they're getting ready to enter the
[18:42] promised land
[18:44] and there's an emphasis from the lord
[18:46] that we can take today as well because
[18:48] we've received a word from the mountain
[18:50] through a prophet again we'll get into
[18:52] that in a minute that was a pivotal
[18:54] point when god brought the word to the
[18:56] mountain for the people and god did it
[18:58] in the old testament god does it in the
[18:59] new testament through a prophet and
[19:01] there's an emphasis after they receive
[19:03] the word from the lord that we can take
[19:05] today as well and the emphasis is don't
[19:08] forget the statues and the commandments
[19:11] and the judgments that i brought to you
[19:13] from the prophet and from the mountain
[19:14] mount sinai or horeb
[19:17] was pointed to so frequently in the old
[19:20] testament
[19:21] so so many times it was pointed back to
[19:24] pointed back to you the statues even
[19:26] when they got in the promised land
[19:28] joshua was to remind him and to preach
[19:30] to them the statues and the things that
[19:32] come from moses as they come into their
[19:34] promised land so they were to be to to
[19:36] keep their minds filled with those
[19:38] things
[19:39] mount sinai was a turning point it was
[19:43] where a prophet was used to deliver the
[19:45] word of god to the people it was a huge
[19:48] pivotal point in history the word of god
[19:52] of how to live was dispensed through a
[19:54] prophet that's what happened god coming
[19:57] on the mountain with his glory and his
[19:59] prophet would be given the word of
[20:02] and that word would be how the people
[20:04] should live for generations to come god
[20:07] said i'll teach you how to live without
[20:09] that they'd be lost they would become
[20:11] idolaters they would become they would
[20:13] be given but he gave them an absolute he
[20:15] gave him this is what this is from my
[20:17] heart this is how you should live as
[20:20] believers in jehovah and it was you talk
[20:22] about specifics
[20:25] read the read your old testament you
[20:27] talk about specifics in that wall
[20:30] i mean it was specifics right down to
[20:32] dietary laws and everything and and if
[20:35] you read those they're to give
[20:36] protection to the people for diseases
[20:39] and all these other things and god had
[20:41] it all in his mind to start with and if
[20:44] you were living in that day you'd almost
[20:46] have to say how does god know about all
[20:48] this if he's never really been here
[20:50] lived out life and he's bringing us such
[20:52] specifics how to live about adultery
[20:55] about young people about all these other
[20:57] things and he's just bringing specific
[20:59] if this happens deal with it this way if
[21:01] this happens if a girl gets gets engaged
[21:04] and her father didn't know about it this
[21:06] happens deal with it this way
[21:08] how does god well god created us
[21:12] and god knew then from the beginning
[21:14] so he says for my people i'm going to
[21:16] give my absolute i'm going to give my
[21:18] word to them so they won't be
[21:20] floundering around if they'll stay with
[21:22] my word they'll have power to be able to
[21:23] live
[21:25] and that should mean a lot to us friends
[21:27] because we've received an even more sure
[21:29] word of prophecy we've received received
[21:31] even more sure of a solid word
[21:35] in the last days
[21:36] as i was sharing with brother jason the
[21:38] other night the glorious word that god
[21:40] does it again he sends his word to the
[21:42] people in the last days to restore them
[21:44] back to the word
[21:46] through a prophet can you say amen
[21:49] so
[21:49] this pivotal point of god on the
[21:52] mountain
[21:53] it was a turning point it was where
[21:55] prophet was used to deliver the word of
[21:56] god to the people the word of how to
[21:58] live was dispensed through a prophet it
[22:01] had the glory of god in it and and and
[22:04] so it had so much glory in it that moses
[22:07] had to veil his face so i want you to
[22:10] see something and i'm taking this very
[22:12] slow i may not get to everything tonight
[22:14] but i just want everybody to understand
[22:16] i would love our children to be able to
[22:18] understand that when god brought the
[22:20] word on the tablets to moses
[22:23] it wasn't just this um
[22:26] uh lifeless
[22:28] uh
[22:29] mechanical
[22:30] spiritless thing that took place
[22:34] the glory of god was all over that
[22:36] mountain
[22:38] and that's something the glory of god
[22:40] was all over that place to where moses
[22:43] had so much the power and the glory of
[22:45] in his face that when he come down out
[22:48] of the mountain the people had they said
[22:51] put a veil over your face they couldn't
[22:53] even see it it was so powerful it's so
[22:54] glorious so the the word
[22:58] isn't just
[22:59] the word
[23:01] the word isn't just tablets
[23:04] the word isn't just letter
[23:06] it has god's glory in it
[23:10] even on mount sinai
[23:12] it had the glory of god in it it had the
[23:15] life of god god's presence was there
[23:18] shaking the mountain actually until the
[23:20] children of israel said because they
[23:22] said let god speak we want god speak and
[23:24] then later after the mountainship they
[23:25] said no no no more we don't want god to
[23:27] speak let moses speak for god
[23:30] you know that it's the people of god
[23:32] that come up with the idea for prophets
[23:35] to speak instead of god personally
[23:37] himself
[23:39] they begged for it at the mountain scene
[23:41] and they set a pattern for all of time
[23:43] that god says i'll speak through my
[23:45] prophets now god knew he was going to do
[23:47] that he didn't change because of the
[23:48] people but they begged for it let moses
[23:50] let the prophet speak now we live in a
[23:52] day we don't want to hear what the
[23:53] prophet has to say
[23:54] we'll hear from god ourselves
[23:57] and yet it was man that suggested it
[23:59] first
[24:01] i don't want to come into the glories of
[24:03] god that's too much for me i i feel too
[24:06] sinful to be in his glory
[24:08] so let the prophet speak
[24:10] and then we'll listen
[24:12] and they didn't they didn't listen
[24:13] anyway
[24:15] but
[24:16] the glory of god surrounded that place
[24:18] it's kind of like the service under here
[24:20] the glory of god was surrounding that
[24:22] place that mountain was filled with the
[24:24] life and the glory of god
[24:27] so it wasn't just
[24:29] this mechanical
[24:31] spiritless
[24:32] dry
[24:33] event
[24:35] the supernatural god was there in that
[24:37] mountain causing the mountain to shake
[24:39] in other words it was not just the word
[24:43] but his presence coming to the people
[24:46] bringing the word to them with his
[24:49] presence
[24:51] praise the lord
[24:52] wasn't just the word
[24:55] it wasn't just our bibles that's why
[24:58] i think there's a quote um and uh i'm
[25:00] i'm 90 sure i might quote it just a
[25:03] little wrong but he said all the glories
[25:04] of god all the blessings of god all the
[25:06] presence of god lies in his word
[25:10] so that's why we come through the
[25:11] channel of his word that's why we
[25:13] saturate it into our lives that's why we
[25:15] get it in our you know start with the
[25:17] brain i mean the the mind is the wound
[25:19] to the soul start there meditate on it
[25:22] get it into your children's minds let
[25:24] them memorize it
[25:26] because the potential of the glory of
[25:28] god is in his word
[25:30] when that triggers and it becomes a
[25:31] revelation to them
[25:34] uh it's over for the devil
[25:36] can you say amen
[25:38] if a young if a young person catches by
[25:40] the holy ghost or revelation of who they
[25:42] are and catches these revelations of the
[25:44] word the devil's day is numbered with
[25:46] that person
[25:48] amen he'll still fight him but that
[25:50] revelated believer the gates of hell
[25:53] brother josiah the gates of hell shall
[25:56] not prevail against the revelation
[25:59] the devil is finished
[26:01] when somebody gets a true revelation
[26:02] from god and you can't get a revelation
[26:04] unless you're around the word of god
[26:06] hearing it
[26:08] amen you can't get it unless you're
[26:10] hearing but because faith cometh by
[26:14] hearing and hearing by the word of god
[26:16] amen so this event in mount sinai was so
[26:19] huge it was a pivotal point in history
[26:22] at least in the history of god's
[26:24] interaction with people
[26:26] but in deuteronomy we we see here these
[26:29] warnings
[26:30] of further instruction
[26:33] that now take these precepts that came
[26:35] from the mountain and from the prophet
[26:37] take these precepts
[26:39] take whatever came from god here and
[26:41] begin integrating them into your daily
[26:44] lives and i i emphasize daily lives and
[26:47] homes because that's what he that's what
[26:50] he talked about he he was referring when
[26:52] he's talking about put sitting with your
[26:55] children in thine house so the very
[26:58] prophet's message
[27:00] would now
[27:01] not stay at the temple or not stay on
[27:04] tablets
[27:07] he's saying
[27:08] bring what was said into your home
[27:12] let your children hear it let your
[27:14] grandchildren hear it
[27:17] put it on the posters put it on the
[27:20] refrigerator put it in your room put it
[27:23] on your phone
[27:27] put it everywhere you look put it in the
[27:29] front of your car put it everywhere that
[27:31] most places you can look you can have
[27:33] the word of god in front of you you
[27:35] can't do that at your job always but you
[27:37] have control of what you have in your
[27:39] home
[27:40] you have control of what you have in
[27:41] your home you have control of what you
[27:43] put in your mind
[27:45] and he's saying let this be saturated
[27:47] let it be integrated into your life let
[27:50] it not stay on the mountain let it not
[27:52] stay on the tablets don't just say moses
[27:54] has the tablets don't just say i've got
[27:56] the books and tapes i've got it i've got
[27:58] it on my phone or i've got it in my
[27:59] shelves i've got all of them i've got
[28:01] the whole set i've got a vintage set
[28:06] well that doesn't impress god can you
[28:09] say man got the whole thing i've got
[28:11] them too
[28:12] brother perry green gave me a set of the
[28:14] red volumes that's the original ones and
[28:16] all the beautiful red hardbound volumes
[28:18] you know he yeah we felt so special to
[28:20] get him and i i do feel special but it's
[28:22] not a type of thing to leave and to
[28:24] glorify on your shelves
[28:26] this has power within it it must be
[28:29] integrated into our daily lives it must
[28:31] be read it must be talked about it must
[28:34] be spoken to the children
[28:36] and more so in this day as they hear the
[28:38] other voices of other standards and
[28:40] other absolutes
[28:42] thank god for the homes that i'm looking
[28:43] around here tonight that raised your
[28:45] children some of them may be astray but
[28:48] thank god that you held that word in
[28:50] front of them
[28:52] because that's what you were supposed to
[28:54] do
[28:55] it'll never go away from
[28:56] them don't we have a promise of that
[29:00] train up a child in a way it should go
[29:03] and they won't depart from it and and
[29:05] one minister brought it that it won't
[29:07] depart from them because that's how this
[29:08] work this word works
[29:11] you see it's going to go with them
[29:14] amen some people grow up in my church
[29:16] they'll say
[29:19] jared it might have been you said this
[29:20] one time
[29:21] all the time i got brother paul's voice
[29:23] in my head constantly saying things
[29:25] and hopefully it's deeper than just
[29:27] brother paul's voice but i remember you
[29:28] saying that maybe you're saying that i
[29:30] remember
[29:30] six years ago that one statement stuck
[29:32] with me
[29:35] amen if it's the word i'm glad it's
[29:37] stuck in your head
[29:39] you can't get rid of me
[29:44] you didn't bring me in and you can't
[29:45] kick me out
[29:48] [Laughter]
[29:50] amen
[29:51] so
[29:52] now he says
[29:54] take this wonderful word but never let
[29:56] it be on the shelf never let it just be
[29:58] in tablets
[30:00] and if god says plaster them everywhere
[30:02] plaster that word everywhere and speak
[30:04] about it
[30:05] the reason he said is he's concerned you
[30:08] will forget
[30:09] what will happen
[30:11] you will forget it and then he tells us
[30:14] what can happen if you forget it
[30:17] it's no longer good enough just to talk
[30:19] about the event of mount sinai or in
[30:21] this case
[30:22] mount sunset
[30:23] it's no longer good about to talk about
[30:25] the event
[30:27] there are a lot of places around in our
[30:29] ranks that would talk about the event
[30:31] and talk about the event and talk about
[30:32] the cloud and we rejoice in the sign god
[30:35] put in the heaven just so you know as a
[30:37] church
[30:38] i don't rest my eternal destination upon
[30:41] that sign that was in the heaven
[30:43] but god said there'll be signs he puts
[30:45] into heaven and that cloud was a sign
[30:48] of the word returning to his people
[30:50] can you say amen so we never belittle it
[30:53] but i don't anchor because the people
[30:54] that have anchored just to the signs and
[30:56] not the voice of the sign they weren't
[30:58] anchored enough
[31:00] and then they're going to nitpick what
[31:01] day did happen and everything else yeah
[31:03] of course because your anchor is in the
[31:04] sign my anchor's not in a sign my
[31:06] anchor's in the word of god and the
[31:08] voice of christ that i've heard through
[31:09] this word
[31:11] and then i thank god for the signs but
[31:13] it happened in a mountain it was mount
[31:15] sunset it was out there in sabino and
[31:17] all these things took place god giving
[31:19] his word to the prophet sending him back
[31:20] to jeffersonville speaking the word of
[31:22] god but it came in a mountain god
[31:24] meeting him a mountain the sword coming
[31:26] in his hand listen friends this isn't
[31:28] just stories our bible is repeated again
[31:31] and a pivotal point for god's people was
[31:34] god to speak to his prophet in the
[31:36] mountain and give him the word for
[31:38] people to live by and it's happened
[31:40] again in the last days we're not left
[31:42] without knowing how to live we know how
[31:44] to live in this hour
[31:46] god has given his word to his people
[31:48] again somebody say praise the lord young
[31:50] people god no matter how wicked this
[31:53] world gets no matter how wicked people
[31:55] get compromises borderline believers
[31:58] don't always remember god himself
[32:00] brought his word to the people to live
[32:02] by and if you live by it you'll be
[32:04] blessed and you'll overcome
[32:06] it's just that simple i believe with all
[32:08] my heart
[32:09] so we must take what was dispensed from
[32:12] god
[32:12] and bring it into our lives and make it
[32:15] the forefront of our conversations
[32:18] and our meditation
[32:20] we should surround ourselves with it
[32:24] i said we should surround ourselves and
[32:26] integrate
[32:28] and bathe ourselves in it
[32:31] constantly
[32:32] as much as we can
[32:36] we should surround ourselves with it why
[32:38] one reason he gives here in the
[32:40] scriptures is that when
[32:42] he says when you come into blessings
[32:45] the tendency to come into blessings is
[32:47] people forget god's principles
[32:49] you can use an example of something
[32:51] someone becoming successful
[32:53] and starting to make a lot of money
[32:55] money can ruin people
[32:57] riches can ruin people
[32:59] it becomes the answer to all things
[33:02] the love of money
[33:03] the love of money is the root of all
[33:05] evil but riches themselves when they
[33:07] increase for somebody it's a test of
[33:09] their character
[33:10] that's right okay
[33:12] so you may say well i hope i'm
[33:14] uh
[33:15] a millionaire someday i hope i get some
[33:18] money and hit the big thing someday
[33:21] that's what i'd like to be as a
[33:23] professional millionaire i'd like to
[33:24] have that as a career
[33:32] and so but you see
[33:33] if you had all that dumped on you
[33:36] it'll become a test
[33:39] it'll test everything that you are
[33:44] you know people sometimes to get a
[33:45] promotion
[33:47] and praise god for it but remember it'll
[33:49] be a test
[33:51] that you glorify god with it you go on
[33:53] with god but for a lot of people it was
[33:55] a test and you seen what really came out
[33:57] of them they began to ditch things and
[33:59] ditch this and lay this aside and lay
[34:02] the word aside
[34:03] because the security of
[34:05] i can got my money to bail me out now i
[34:08] got my money so i don't need to depend
[34:09] on god as much it's such a deception
[34:12] such a deception
[34:14] so i want to stay like paul and i trust
[34:16] that i can that he said and i've i've
[34:19] learned to be without and i've heard
[34:21] learned to have a lot and i've been in
[34:23] both places
[34:24] but i've learned whatever state i'm in
[34:27] to be content
[34:29] i'm not going to change my praise not
[34:31] going to change my worship not going to
[34:33] quit coming to church can you say amen
[34:35] money's not going to change me i already
[34:37] have an absolute in my life i'm already
[34:39] a rich man i'm a millionaire spiritually
[34:41] i hit the lottery spiritually when i got
[34:43] saved
[34:45] i become a billionaire spiritually so
[34:48] any added blessings to pay the bills
[34:50] praise the lord but if i never got it if
[34:52] i stayed a pulper my whole life i'm a
[34:55] millionaire already
[34:58] i'm rich in faith and open love i got
[35:02] more than my share

[36:43] you're a billionaire spiritually if
[36:45] you've got this message with the seven
[36:47] seals open and the fullness of his word
[36:49] returned to his people you're a
[36:50] spiritual billionaire somebody say
[36:52] praise the lord amen
[36:56] praise the lord and some of you young
[36:58] people have thought that i'm closing now
[36:59] you're wrong i'm going on
[37:02] no no this is too good we can't quit
[37:04] right now
[37:06] don't quit while you're ahead right not
[37:08] not in christianity
[37:12] so one of the reasons that
[37:14] we have to keep the word integrated in
[37:16] our lives when we're rich or poor
[37:19] whatever we are
[37:21] riches can make us forget
[37:24] and when you forget you become drawn
[37:26] easily by the flesh
[37:28] and he has specific things that he
[37:29] mentions as distractions and a lot of
[37:32] them are once you get in the land now
[37:33] only god would know this to tell him but
[37:35] once you get in this land of blessing
[37:36] once you get in this land that is your
[37:38] land you'll have to fight for it but it
[37:39] is your land but once you get in there
[37:42] you're going to come to goodly cities
[37:43] you're going to take the enemy out it's
[37:45] going to become yours and so these
[37:47] things will be handed to you the goodly
[37:49] cities he talks about the um
[37:52] uh
[37:53] the uh wells that you didn't have to dig
[37:56] he talks about the good thing house is
[37:58] full of good things
[38:00] and a lot of this is i i think of
[38:02] americans because a lot of it is just
[38:04] given i think like a spoiled kid he
[38:06] didn't have to work for it he was just
[38:08] given to him
[38:10] and that's a trap when stuff's just
[38:11] given to us we don't appreciate it as
[38:13] much
[38:14] amen you become wealthy and things are
[38:16] just handed to you
[38:18] and natural riches
[38:20] and conveniences
[38:22] can make us spoiled
[38:25] natural riches and now i got money i
[38:28] don't have to worry about things i can
[38:29] buy one i want to buy
[38:31] just be careful that line you go down
[38:33] because you can become spoiled and the
[38:35] first thing you begin to forget is the
[38:37] lord
[38:38] natural things tend to lure us away from
[38:40] god's word
[38:42] in a life saturated with god's word
[38:45] there's been a million people go through
[38:46] that before million examples where rich
[38:49] has ruined them
[38:51] and they left the word
[38:54] and if they're a child of god they'll go
[38:56] through a lot of things god will test
[38:57] them take their money away whatever has
[38:59] to be done he's going to bring him back
[39:00] but we don't want to go down that path
[39:02] we want to be trusting him whether we
[39:04] have riches or we don't have riches
[39:05] whatever happens we don't want to forget
[39:07] the lord and the way we don't forget the
[39:09] lord is we keep him before us
[39:12] you don't forget something if it's
[39:14] always
[39:15] uh good music and good word in your car
[39:18] and it's all over your house and it's
[39:20] what you're keeping in your conversation
[39:21] mostly and it's what you keep your
[39:23] thoughts on you don't forget that
[39:26] so how we forget is that it gets placed
[39:29] and there's another distraction that
[39:30] something else comes in front of that's
[39:31] how our brains work
[39:34] you got something that's in front of you
[39:35] every day you don't forget it
[39:38] david said i set the lord before me
[39:40] every day i set the lord before me and
[39:44] if he's right in front of you you're not
[39:46] gonna forget him
[39:48] amen so let's see so people you know
[39:52] it lures us away from god's word
[39:54] we forget the lord and we take for
[39:57] granted the simple life of just loving
[39:59] him
[40:00] and serving him
[40:02] and we can take the wealth of what the
[40:04] word has given us
[40:06] we can take the wealth of what the word
[40:08] has given us for granted as well
[40:11] just like naturally riches can ruin
[40:13] somebody
[40:14] i think sometimes there's people even in
[40:16] the ranks of this message
[40:18] that are so
[40:21] become almost gloated and almost
[40:23] proudful
[40:25] with the word that they have they've
[40:27] forgotten the lost
[40:28] they forgot simplicity they've forgotten
[40:31] their relationship with the lord but oh
[40:33] they're just so
[40:36] full on the buffet of this word and the
[40:38] doctrinal part of it which is fine
[40:40] but they become big and
[40:42] big-headed
[40:44] proud
[40:46] they forget that simple walk with the
[40:47] lord
[40:49] to forget to pray and god send the holy
[40:51] ghost today so lives can be changed
[40:54] i say never remind you of that if you
[40:55] believe god said a prophet you got the
[40:57] holy ghost that's the type of stuff we
[40:58] hear
[40:59] you believe this and this and this and
[41:00] this church then you've that proves
[41:02] you've got the holy ghost no a person
[41:04] needs the experience of christ himself
[41:07] through the word through the word
[41:09] but they need to experience this christ
[41:11] themselves
[41:13] never forget that we tend to forget and
[41:15] then we get really wealthy and we can
[41:17] take things for granted for example the
[41:20] good ministry we have in in that god's
[41:22] provided the fightful ministry you can
[41:24] take them for granted
[41:27] you can take your sister brothers and
[41:28] sisters for granted sometimes you can
[41:30] take church for granted and miss too
[41:32] much and you just you take well they'll
[41:34] be there uh and so i'll be there when i
[41:36] when it's convenient for me to be there
[41:39] and you take things for granted take
[41:41] kinks for granted when you're receiving
[41:42] the correction of the word a brother or
[41:45] sister coming and correcting you
[41:48] you tend to take that for granted but
[41:50] that's a great blessing if it's the
[41:51] correction of the lord
[41:53] and to resist it is a bad thing
[41:56] the bible speaks of bastard born
[41:58] children because they won't receive the
[42:00] correction of the word so there's no new
[42:03] birth there and one of their problems in
[42:04] signs is they won't receive correction
[42:07] they won't receive it
[42:09] and
[42:11] so
[42:12] i'll just end on that point that we can
[42:14] also take for granted and become wealthy
[42:16] with all the things and remember the the
[42:19] promised land he's speaking of is a
[42:20] natural land but every bit of the
[42:22] promised land types a spiritual promised
[42:23] land for us and we can come into all
[42:25] these glories that we defeat the enemy
[42:27] and take this city and take this
[42:28] possession i've got this i've got this
[42:31] but even that he said don't forget the
[42:33] lord
[42:34] don't forget his word
[42:36] don't forget to teach your we don't take
[42:38] for granted that we still live in a
[42:40] world where we need to teach our
[42:42] children the basics of the bible
[42:46] we need to not forget to teach our
[42:47] children the basics of of salvation and
[42:50] teach our children and read them the
[42:51] basics can you say amen no skip to the
[42:54] end skip to the skip to the
[42:56] real high stuff no no no let's not
[42:58] forget any of it let's not forget any of
[43:00] it
[43:01] and don't forget to be simple and teach
[43:03] it simple to your kids that's what god's
[43:05] saying here no matter how much word we
[43:07] get and bless we get let's not forget
[43:10] the simple things let's not forget our
[43:13] relationship with the lord
[43:14] let's not forget our relationship with
[43:16] others
[43:17] got a sermon coming up on relationships
[43:19] the lord's really dealing with me
[43:21] somewhere down the road here i don't
[43:22] know
[43:23] but i don't hear to me preachers talking
[43:25] about
[43:26] how god taught us
[43:29] what relationship is and
[43:31] brought us into a relationship with him
[43:34] and through that a trickle-down effect
[43:36] is we should learn and know
[43:39] what it means to have good relationships
[43:41] with people
[43:43] but i find a world even within our rank
[43:45] sometimes i don't have a friend in the
[43:46] world i don't need friends i tell my
[43:48] wife today i thought this that's funny
[43:49] we're constantly texting all kinds of
[43:51] people around the world
[43:52] and yet the same people sometimes will
[43:54] say but i don't have any friends
[43:56] so we must be missing something
[43:59] from what we're doing in the subject of
[44:00] relationship
[44:02] people are afraid of it
[44:05] so we're missing some elements there so
[44:07] maybe the lord will help us
[44:09] here's another reason
[44:11] that god says stay in the word stay
[44:13] saturated with the word
[44:16] and we will get into this more next
[44:17] wednesday night lord willing
[44:19] now just say something about it god
[44:21] knows how we're built
[44:22] let me just say it the other reason that
[44:24] god warns he says when you get in there
[44:26] if you don't stay close to the world
[44:27] you'll be drawn to other idols
[44:30] because you're going to have the test of
[44:31] other idols
[44:33] so god knows how we are built as a human
[44:36] being and he's given these warnings
[44:37] because we are built in a way
[44:39] that has the potential for a diversified
[44:41] heart
[44:44] god knows man has the potential to have
[44:47] a diversified worship in other words he
[44:50] can worship many gods
[44:52] or he can worship one god that's not the
[44:54] true god but usually it's a diversified
[44:56] heart i'll give him a piece of my heart
[44:57] to this god a piece of my heart i
[44:59] worship this i worship that i worship
[45:01] that a diversified heart and here in the
[45:03] scripture i read you tonight god says
[45:05] but i am one lord
[45:07] and you're going to serve me you serve
[45:09] you only worship one god
[45:12] idolatry teach us to have a diversified
[45:14] heart that we give a part of ourselves
[45:16] and a part of our worship to other gods
[45:19] and if you think that was in just the
[45:20] old testament you're crazy we have
[45:22] images all over us to worship
[45:26] on the television on our phones images
[45:29] are placed in front of us every day
[45:32] to distract us to woo us away
[45:35] the human being with all of his emotions
[45:38] can be idolatrous and distracted to
[45:41] other gods than the one true god the
[45:43] only way to keep from that happening is
[45:45] to become consumed with one god to
[45:48] consume with god and the christ who's
[45:50] the revealing of god
[45:52] can you say amen
[45:54] god is looking at where our emotions our
[45:56] passions are directed to i may look at
[45:59] you and not know where your passions are
[46:00] directed to i may not know that but god
[46:03] knows where your passions are directed
[46:05] remember worship isn't just when you're
[46:07] here in church raising your hands
[46:09] worship is the whole laying
[46:12] before something it's giving your heart
[46:14] and passion to something
[46:16] that's worship of the human being and
[46:18] the only way to keep that from happening
[46:20] is to become consumed with god that's
[46:21] another reason why it says stay
[46:23] saturated integrated with the word of
[46:25] god god is looking at where our emotions
[46:27] and passions are directed to this
[46:29] scripture shows that it's not just our
[46:31] soul he wants us to give but everything
[46:34] that we are that's why he says when you
[46:36] love me love me with all your he doesn't
[46:38] just say just love me with your soul and
[46:40] the rest of you
[46:41] just wing it
[46:42] no this is integrated in all of our
[46:44] lives
[46:46] when you love me it's got to be with
[46:48] your mind soul body strength
[46:51] heart everything
[46:53] and why does god say that because he's a
[46:55] jealous god
[46:57] and all of our worship and passion and
[46:59] direction goes only to one
[47:03] it's kind of like a wife and a husband
[47:05] if that's a proper marriage can you say
[47:06] amen their devotion naturally on this
[47:09] earth their devotion is to one partner
[47:12] for life that's it
[47:15] all of their attention all their
[47:16] flirting all this stuff belongs to one
[47:19] person
[47:20] and whenever it steps out of that even
[47:22] in little steps it's an adulterous
[47:24] spirit
[47:26] so the church has done that for 2000
[47:28] years an adultery she's called the
[47:30] mother of harlots
[47:31] it's an adulterous spirit on the church
[47:33] that left her true husband still wants
[47:36] to name his name but she has all these
[47:38] other shapes she opens herself up to all
[47:41] kind of other husbands that's why she's
[47:43] called that so you individually can be
[47:45] diverted in your heart like that
[47:47] and
[47:48] say i'm married to christ but your heart
[47:51] is given to someone else a woman can do
[47:53] that a man can do that with his wife a
[47:55] woman and if a woman and man can do it
[47:57] we see every day sometimes that happens
[47:59] in our world especially then that's the
[48:01] type naturally of what happens
[48:03] spiritually
[48:04] i tell our young people you want to pray
[48:06] and
[48:07] young men
[48:08] you want to pray that god makes you a
[48:11] one
[48:12] woman man
[48:14] for life
[48:19] somebody you're smiling because you've
[48:21] heard me say that young people
[48:22] pray that god makes you a one-woman man
[48:25] and girls pray that god makes you a
[48:27] one-man woman for life
[48:30] now while you're single pray
[48:34] not you know
[48:36] three or four or five guys that you
[48:38] dated and then you know that's oh that's
[48:40] a worthy point that god help me
[48:42] and i might meet a few and i might you
[48:44] know go with a few a few but it's just
[48:46] my prayers that lord lead me to
[48:48] that one person for my life and i will
[48:51] give all my devotion to them
[48:53] i won't share it with anybody else
[48:55] nothing worse when a man starts to share
[48:58] some of his affections with the women on
[49:00] the screen and not his own wife
[49:04] there's nothing worse that hurts the
[49:05] heart of a woman worse than that when
[49:07] she finds out
[49:08] she hardly can forgive it and why is
[49:11] that because god's placed something
[49:12] within her
[49:14] the same thing god has within himself
[49:16] i want
[49:18] all of your devotion directed to me
[49:21] you understand
[49:23] and you you you know a man sometimes
[49:26] will experience when he when he would
[49:28] make a mistake and there ends up being a
[49:29] separation in a marriage and it's
[49:31] because of his unfaithfulness same thing
[49:33] on the woman's side but it's such a hurt
[49:35] it's such a
[49:36] it's the deepest hurt can that can
[49:39] strike a woman especially but a man as
[49:40] well it just it's hard to recover from
[49:44] it's hard to forgive
[49:46] because it just cuts to the core of us
[49:47] when we realize somebody spoke a vow to
[49:50] me and they're not devoted to me they
[49:53] cheated on me
[49:54] it cuts to the very core of us
[49:57] how does that cut to the heart of god
[50:00] when he sees our heart diverted
[50:03] he wants all of us
[50:05] he wants our 100 devotion
[50:08] and i could say more but a one
[50:11] man a one woman man one man woman for
[50:13] life say well i don't know who she is
[50:16] yet who he is yet you still have the
[50:18] prayer
[50:19] i'm one for life
[50:21] when i meet them and when i
[50:23] after i get to know them and it's god's
[50:24] will and things come together
[50:26] when i make that commitment
[50:28] it's one woman the rest of my life it's
[50:30] one man the rest of my life and all my
[50:32] devotion
[50:33] all my passions all my sexual passions
[50:35] all my emotional passions all my love
[50:38] all my attention everything from then on
[50:42] gets directed to one person for the rest
[50:45] of your life
[50:48] if we had more absolute like that we had
[50:51] less adulteries and less cheating in
[50:53] marriages
[50:55] if young people as single people would
[50:56] resolve that
[50:57] i'm not going to get i'm not going to
[50:59] get married i'm not i'm not going to
[51:01] unequally yoke for an unbeliever that's
[51:03] a no-brainer with an unbeliever but i'm
[51:05] going to pray that god gives me the
[51:06] right want and i will be with lord when
[51:09] you give me that right one even if it
[51:11] takes a while everybody listening
[51:15] i am willing to wait because
[51:20] your your worst day
[51:24] as a single person your worst possible
[51:26] day maybe you can think of it right now
[51:29] your worst day as a single person not
[51:32] being married is better
[51:35] than being in a miserable marriage
[51:40] that's right
[51:43] so you wait
[51:46] and you trust god
[51:48] it's going to be
[51:49] of the lord and it'll be right or it
[51:52] won't be at all
[51:54] now i preached way to the extreme that
[51:56] way not to scare people but to put the
[51:58] fear of the lord in them
[51:59] because i want it to be right for you
[52:02] you you should know that i'm a pastor
[52:05] who prays for our single people that god
[52:08] will send their mates
[52:10] all the time
[52:12] i pray for you
[52:13] that god will send the right one
[52:16] hopefully to this church
[52:20] i don't pray it that way
[52:22] but there is a contract that if they
[52:24] visit here they have to sign
[52:30] there's no contract is there brandon i
[52:33] think there is there is okay in my
[52:34] church i guess there would be
[52:35] [Applause]
[52:37] some young people say typical him and
[52:38] brother barry they would have a contract
[52:40] like that
[52:43] yeah so it's real it's it's a one and so
[52:46] if that's
[52:47] if that makes for a solid oneness in a
[52:50] marriage that all devotion everything is
[52:54] directed to one person for life if
[52:56] that's a natural level how much more our
[52:58] relationship with god
[53:01] i'm about christ and that's it and if he
[53:03] asked me to give up something it's done
[53:05] it's over i'm i'm giving it up because i
[53:07] love him so much
[53:09] this habit it's finished because i love
[53:12] him more than i love the habit
[53:15] you see
[53:17] and he did the same thing for you at
[53:18] calvary
[53:21] i give up my life i give up my
[53:23] convenience and had a choice
[53:26] christ had a choice to stay in this
[53:28] world and even marry a wife the normal
[53:31] way and he gave up that choice for a
[53:33] bride that i'm preaching to here tonight
[53:37] he was a one-woman man can you say amen
[53:40] christ was a one-woman man
[53:42] he did everything he gave his life
[53:44] for us praise the lord
[53:46] but we'll talk more about idolatry next
[53:49] week you know it's it's the other reason
[53:52] that he when he says
[53:54] the lord our lord is one lord
[53:57] it's a foundational truth for every
[53:59] human being wanting to embrace the true
[54:01] god
[54:02] he must know that he is one he doesn't
[54:04] share his glory with anyone not even a
[54:07] trinity doctrine
[54:10] he doesn't share his glory with two
[54:12] others
[54:16] this will this these kind of doctrines
[54:18] will unravel
[54:20] a confused heart in other words it will
[54:21] confuse our heart even more and god is
[54:24] saying the lord our god is one lord
[54:25] because all that we are all that we
[54:27] worship should be directed to one not
[54:29] diverted to many he knows just around
[54:32] the corner is the test of other gods and
[54:34] other things to worship that all want a
[54:36] piece of their heart and he's giving
[54:38] these warnings before they go into the
[54:39] promised land keep yourself from idols
[54:42] little children keep yourself from idols
[54:45] make me your passion stay in the word
[54:48] that i've given you from a prophet
[54:51] when you love me love me with all you
[54:53] god
[54:54] i don't want lip service god says
[54:56] this isn't some mechanical intellectual
[54:58] dry ideal
[55:00] this is not a ritual of burning a candle
[55:03] this is not a theology
[55:05] this is directing who we are as a person
[55:08] towards the one true god
[55:10] he knows when it's from your heart
[55:12] just like your wife knows brothers when
[55:14] it's from your heart
[55:16] she can tell when the sum of all your
[55:18] passion is towards her you can see it in
[55:20] his eyes you can feel it in his touch
[55:23] you can hear it in his voice and it's
[55:25] the same with god he can tell if all
[55:27] your heart is towards him
[55:31] it's the same thing he says to the
[55:32] laodicean church i'd rather have you be
[55:35] cold
[55:36] or hot
[55:37] than to be lukewarm with me
[55:40] and your attentions
[55:42] so
[55:44] i'm closing to say it would no longer be
[55:47] good enough just to believe and
[55:48] acknowledge that his presence came on
[55:50] the mountain and gave us the word from a
[55:52] prophet
[55:54] under the pressures here
[55:56] and the pressures that are coming
[55:59] we must keep that's what god's saying as
[56:01] i close under the pressures here he says
[56:03] and the pressures that are coming in the
[56:05] promised land
[56:06] when those pressures are coming we must
[56:09] keep that word
[56:11] in front of us
[56:12] all the time
[56:13] we must talk about it i'd say under
[56:16] modern times
[56:18] the only way to live a victorious life
[56:19] over laodicea is just let the fire of
[56:22] god consume you daily
[56:24] not weekly
[56:26] daily
[56:27] we must stay in the channel
[56:29] we must get under the spout where the
[56:30] glory comes out
[56:34] you'll have to make some changes you'll
[56:35] have to cut some things out of your life
[56:37] that you spend so much in and replace it
[56:39] with the word of god
[56:41] it's an age to be distracted
[56:43] and to quickly wander away
[56:46] from that priority of the word of god in
[56:48] his presence
[56:49] i'm going to read to you next week we'll
[56:51] talk about it out of malachi 4. i'll
[56:53] just read it before we close malachi 4
[56:56] talks about our prophet to this
[56:58] generation but did you know just before
[57:00] it in malachi 4
[57:02] last six scriptures of the old testament
[57:04] verse 4 and
[57:06] chapter 4 verse 1 for behold the day
[57:08] cometh that shall burn this is what we
[57:10] are preaching about sunday the day
[57:12] cometh that shall burn as an oven and
[57:14] all the proud gay and all that do
[57:15] wickedly shall be stubble and the day
[57:18] that cometh shall burn them saith the
[57:19] lord of host that it shall leave them
[57:21] neither root nor branch
[57:23] but unto you that fear my name shall the
[57:26] son of righteousness arise with healing
[57:28] in his wings
[57:30] and ye shall go forth and grow up as
[57:33] calves of the stall now all this is
[57:36] prophecy for our day because this is the
[57:37] day that judgment comes this is the day
[57:39] that the earth shall burn like an oven
[57:41] and the wicked shall be a stubble this
[57:43] is all going to happen and it says but
[57:45] you that fear my name name the son of
[57:47] righteousness arise with healing his
[57:48] wings you shall go forth as
[57:50] grow up as calves of the stall
[57:54] um commentators have different views of
[57:56] that but if you just take it as it is
[57:59] um you have two things there you shall
[58:00] be he's talking about the people of god
[58:02] you should be calves of the stall well
[58:05] you got they said calves that are full
[58:07] they're well fed
[58:09] so
[58:10] the people of god will be well-fed
[58:13] while there's a famine in the land
[58:16] but you know calves of the stall that
[58:18] you could say at calves that are let out
[58:20] of the stall
[58:22] you ever seen calves that are let out of
[58:24] the stall
[58:26] enraptured
[58:29] they jump around with joy
[58:34] speaking of the bride
[58:35] you know what friends we're going to be
[58:36] let out of the stall someday
[58:39] can you say amen
[58:40] and i'm not going to be acting all
[58:42] reserved like this tonight
[58:44] i'm going to be like a calve when they
[58:46] act and they get out of the stall
[58:48] glory be to god
[58:52] but unto you okay verse three and he
[58:54] shall ye shall tread down the wicked for
[58:55] they shall be ashes under the soldier of
[58:57] your feet in the day after that third
[58:59] war after everything's over then the
[59:02] righteous walk upon the ashes of the
[59:03] wicked look what he says in verse 4 and
[59:05] all these scriptures about us at the end
[59:06] time and everything is going to happen
[59:07] in the end time remember ye the law of
[59:10] moses my servant which i commanded him
[59:13] in horeb in sinai
[59:16] for all israel with the statues and
[59:18] judgments
[59:19] why is this in here
[59:22] it's that theme
[59:24] remember
[59:26] what i sent
[59:27] through my prophet that's right
[59:29] if you're going to live in this day
[59:32] where
[59:33] war is looming upon us
[59:35] where you're just before the rapture
[59:38] stay in the word of god
[59:40] and remember the statues of the lord
[59:44] same reminder as in deuteronomy
[59:46] behold i will send you elijah the
[59:48] prophet well that's interesting because
[59:50] moses was the one that brought the word
[59:51] to the mount sinai and oreb
[59:54] and then he refers to our prophet for
[59:56] this day
[59:57] says elijah the prophet i'll send you
[59:59] before the coming of the great and
[1:00:00] dreadful day of the lord
[1:00:02] and he shall turn the heart of the
[1:00:04] fathers to the children
[1:00:06] and the heart of the children to their
[1:00:07] fathers lest i come and smite the earth
[1:00:10] with a curse
[1:00:12] i see myself all over that
[1:00:15] can you say man
[1:00:16] that's where we live and we've received
[1:00:18] elijah
[1:00:19] so now let's
[1:00:21] saturate and integrate
[1:00:23] the word
[1:00:24] into our lives
[1:00:26] like we never have before
[1:00:28] see sometimes i read and it just seems
[1:00:30] so mechanical and just seeing sometimes
[1:00:32] i read it i don't feel the spirit of the
[1:00:34] lord keep reading it
[1:00:36] stay in it
[1:00:37] stay reading it to your children oh it
[1:00:39] just seems so mechanical when i'm doing
[1:00:40] devotion to those kids and you know they
[1:00:43] might fall asleep or whatever keep doing
[1:00:45] it
[1:00:47] stay in the word keep reading it to them
[1:00:49] because god has a way of his powers in
[1:00:51] the word of influence in that child when
[1:00:53] you don't think he's being influenced i
[1:00:55] believe he's being influenced
[1:00:56] she's being influenced amen i sure
[1:00:59] enjoyed the word with you tonight
[1:01:01] it's been good to be in the house of the
[1:01:03] lord let's stand together amen let's
[1:01:05] give the lord a hand
[1:01:06] [Applause]
[1:01:11] i was glad when they said unto me let's
[1:01:12] go to the house of the lord that's what
[1:01:14] david said i was glad when they said we
[1:01:16] know there's going to be something good
[1:01:17] every time we gather together and we
[1:01:20] meet even online i know that people
[1:01:22] receive things from the lord and that's
[1:01:24] our invisible god and christ coming in
[1:01:28] our mess and speaking through his word
[1:01:29] helping us along our journey
[1:01:31] and we need his strength and his help at
[1:01:33] this time amen continue remember jim's
[1:01:36] sister andez's husband jim and he'll be
[1:01:38] having some therapy here the next few
[1:01:40] days
[1:01:41] and weeks to get that back in shape it's
[1:01:44] not good to get uh hip broken at this
[1:01:46] age so we want to just lift him up in
[1:01:47] prayer that he would receive healing
[1:01:49] from the lord and all the other requests
[1:01:51] tonight that were mentioned we always
[1:01:53] take them home with us and we always
[1:01:54] want to remember them as well i want the
[1:01:56] word integrated in my life
[1:01:58] i want to work counter culture
[1:02:01] i want to work against laodicea
[1:02:04] i can't do that for you but i can
[1:02:06] teach you and train you this is what
[1:02:08] moses and them were saying back then and
[1:02:10] it's even more important now
[1:02:12] integrate let god be
[1:02:15] your if you want life to come together
[1:02:17] and a lot of other things and things you
[1:02:19] they're not coming together just stay
[1:02:21] focused on him just keep that word
[1:02:23] before you
[1:02:24] and all the other things fall into place
[1:02:27] because
[1:02:28] center
[1:02:30] key of f i think
[1:02:35] you are the center
[1:02:38] center of my life
[1:02:43] you're the reason why
[1:02:49] i can live more abundantly
[1:02:54] let there be nothing
[1:02:58] nothing placed before you
[1:03:05] [Music]
[1:03:09] i want to do everything
[1:03:12] through christ
[1:03:15] the center
[1:03:18] the center of my life
[1:03:22] first verse
[1:03:24] seems i have a million things to do
