[4:32] so here I S
[4:36] today giving my
[4:39] life
[4:41] away first John chapter 3 if You' turn
[4:44] with me and hereby we know that we are
[4:47] of the truth and shall assure our hearts
[4:51] before him for if our heart condemn
[4:55] us God is greater than our heart
[5:00] and knoweth all things he knoweth you
[5:03] know all things pretty much covers
[5:06] everything uh he knoweth all things that
[5:09] means he knows you and he knows what
[5:12] you're going through and he knows your
[5:13] heart and he knows you better than you
[5:16] know yourself these are these are things
[5:19] we can anchor in to have confidence and
[5:22] to have peace when our heart doesn't
[5:25] have confidence and when our heart is
[5:27] feeling condemned we anchor into the
[5:30] the the assurance that God knows all
[5:33] things for if our heart cond excuse me
[5:37] hereby we know that we of the truth and
[5:38] shall assure our hearts before him for
[5:40] if our heart condemn us God is greater
[5:42] than our heart and knoweth all things
[5:45] but we should finish the theme Here
[5:47] beloved if our heart condemn us not then
[5:52] have we confidence toward God and
[5:56] whatsoever we ask we receive of him him
[6:00] because we keep his Commandments and do
[6:02] those things that are pleasing in his
[6:04] sight now in 1 John chapter 3 in verse
[6:08] 19 I want to read it in another
[6:10] translation and uh go into this just few
[6:13] scriptures here about condemnation in
[6:16] the heart to hear the voice of
[6:19] condemnation uh which is usually the
[6:21] voice of Satan you can condemn yourself
[6:24] and you can belittle yourself but most
[6:27] of the condemnation is is origin ated
[6:30] from our enemy Satan because he dwells
[6:32] in the realm of
[6:34] condemnation Satan dwells in the realm
[6:37] of
[6:38] guilt Satan is the top um you know
[6:42] people that put a guilt trip on you
[6:45] Satan was the originator of that he is
[6:49] the guilt trip enemy that knows how to
[6:52] put guilt in the heart of an individual
[6:54] and you know why he's so good at at at
[6:57] speaking voices of condemnation you know
[6:59] why he's so guilt uh so good at uh
[7:03] speaking guilt to you is because he's
[7:05] guilty he's a guilty
[7:07] creature he's done a lot of bad stuff
[7:11] and he's guilty and he can't he can't
[7:14] find repentance and so he's got an
[7:16] accumulation from even in heaven before
[7:19] the Earth was created even in heaven
[7:22] he's accumulated a lot of things that
[7:25] he's caused a lot of stir a lot of
[7:27] rebellion can you say amen and he's got
[7:29] 6,000 years of it now on Earth and he's
[7:32] under guilt and shame and condemnation
[7:35] and so we don't want to receive voices
[7:37] we we don't want to be listening to a
[7:40] voice of a guilt-ridden creature that
[7:43] doesn't know how to find relief for his
[7:46] guilt we don't want to be listening to a
[7:49] voice like that we don't want a voice
[7:51] like that governing our hearts can you
[7:53] say Amen because we are called to be
[7:56] free from condemnation can I get get an
[7:59] amen this morning but the reason that he
[8:02] is so much that way is because he's
[8:04] guilty himself I'll get into a little
[8:05] bit that a little more of that in a
[8:07] minute now in another translation it
[8:09] says in verse 19 if you're reading along
[8:11] this then is how we know that we belong
[8:14] to the truth this is how we uh that we
[8:17] will be confident in God's presence so
[8:20] this is something I don't want you to
[8:21] skip over and just just miss this
[8:24] morning when we come into the presence
[8:26] of God we are supposed to come a certain
[8:28] way and that's to come and stand
[8:30] confident in his presence and in order
[8:33] to stand confidence in his presence and
[8:36] in order to worship freely I was
[8:37] watching in the office on the Monitor
[8:40] and so many people just lifting their
[8:42] hands Isn't it nice to have a place that
[8:44] we can worship freely can you say amen
[8:47] and just lift our hands and dance or
[8:49] shout or say Amen or sing to the top of
[8:52] our voice even if you don't have a good
[8:54] voice you can sing to the top of your
[8:56] voice I won't to ask you to raise your
[8:58] hand who that is this morning morning
[8:59] but you can Worship the Lord freely can
[9:02] you say amen and and so I was a
[9:04] wonderful thing to see but when we come
[9:06] to God and when we come into His
[9:08] presence whether it's in church or in
[9:10] your home there's a way that we need to
[9:13] come and that's to be confident uh to
[9:16] one word in the Bible in Hebrews is bold
[9:18] to come into His presence boldly bring
[9:21] in our petitions to him and there's no
[9:23] way to come confident and boldly if you
[9:26] have condemnation in your heart you
[9:29] can't worship freely if you have
[9:31] condemnation so we have to talk about
[9:33] this because he said this is how we be
[9:36] we're confident in God's presence
[9:38] presence if our conscience condemns us
[9:41] we know that God is greater than our
[9:44] conscience and that he knows everything
[9:47] now we're we're a a five-part being uh
[9:52] uh both in the flesh and in the spirit
[9:54] our soul is one thing we can have
[9:56] unbelief in our soul but then when God
[9:58] converts us we We Believe from our soul
[10:00] but then we're we're there's other parts
[10:02] of us me memory imagination conscience
[10:05] affection reasoning and the conscience
[10:07] part all these parts are important but
[10:09] the conscience part is many times where
[10:10] the devil reeks habit so we got all
[10:13] these other areas of us and if our soul
[10:15] becomes born again then Satan only has
[10:19] uh the uh the spirit part he has our
[10:22] memory he has imagination he has
[10:24] conscience he has affection he has
[10:26] reasoning then five parts to our body
[10:28] see taste feel smell and here to
[10:30] physically make us ill it's all he's
[10:32] left with but the victory is is that
[10:34] there's so much going on in the soul
[10:36] that that as brother ramam said in
[10:38] greatest battle ever fought you blow out
[10:40] all these fools and all these channels
[10:42] can you say Amen bring it under
[10:44] subjection to God and then he says the
[10:46] devil doesn't know how to what to do
[10:47] with you because and so here is the the
[10:50] truth and greatest battle it's not just
[10:53] that our souls are saved that's not a
[10:55] life of Victory the life of Victory is
[10:57] we take all these other emotional
[11:00] conscience memory and we bring him under
[11:03] God fill them with the Holy Spirit
[11:05] instead of the enemy and now we're
[11:07] talking a Victorious
[11:10] Christian now we're talking a maturing
[11:12] Christian now we're talking somebody
[11:13] he's he's getting some Victory and can
[11:16] worship freely and can be confident can
[11:19] you say
[11:20] Amen so now uh obviously here Christians
[11:24] should live with a confidence that we
[11:26] are of the truth that's the first
[11:28] statement that we we must know that we
[11:30] were of the truth not only do we believe
[11:33] the truth but we are that's how it's
[11:36] worded we are of the truth that's deeper
[11:38] than believing the truth we are actually
[11:41] of the truth we are children we are
[11:45] Offspring yeah of Mr truth himself Jesus
[11:49] Christ we're not just believing truth
[11:51] like here's the Bible and and we believe
[11:54] all the things that's in it no we are of
[11:56] the truth we have been birthed by the
[12:00] UNC Incorruptible seed word of God we
[12:03] are children of
[12:07] Truth say well I believe this message I
[12:09] believe the devil believes the message
[12:12] in certain ways certain parts of it the
[12:14] devil
[12:15] believes and he trembles there's no
[12:18] furtherance of his belief the devil
[12:20] mechanically can believe it but you see
[12:22] now that's not what we are we're not
[12:24] just people that are believing the truth
[12:26] we are of the truth we are connected we
[12:30] are Offspring we are the seed of the
[12:33] word we don't just believe the devil
[12:36] believes we are connected with truth can
[12:38] you say amen I receive truth because
[12:42] truth is in me that's deeper than just
[12:45] believing we hear it so much just
[12:47] believe believe you got to believe this
[12:49] believe the message believe it but this
[12:50] is deeper than believe it we have to be
[12:52] birthed and be of
[12:54] truth truth is us it's more a part of us
[12:58] than anything else life we are a people
[13:01] of Truth we're Children of the truth
[13:03] that's the Father and Son Fellowship
[13:06] it's truth can you say Amen our
[13:08] fellowship with is the father and his
[13:10] son the son is the word and the the word
[13:13] is truth and the father sent the word
[13:15] truth and so this is the fellowship
[13:17] between the father and the son it's
[13:19] Fellowship this is not a mental exercise
[13:24] we are children of Truth can you say
[13:28] Amen we are to come and to assure our
[13:32] hearts in his presence here's the next
[13:34] statement when we come we are to assure
[13:37] our hearts in other words we set our
[13:40] hearts at rest we reassure our hearts in
[13:44] his presence confidence when we come
[13:47] into His presence that's the way that we
[13:51] should be coming completely free nothing
[13:54] between us when we come there shouldn't
[13:57] be anything between us and
[14:01] God now I'm not being critical but I I
[14:05] would just say that a lot of us because
[14:07] we don't know this is the way that we
[14:10] come to God and this is the way we come
[14:12] to his presence is that we deal with
[14:14] everything we bring it under the blood
[14:16] if it's sin we bring it under the blood
[14:17] if if it's guilt if it's a voice of
[14:19] condemnation we deal with it we deal
[14:21] with it and why that's so we can stand
[14:23] in the presence of almighty God with
[14:26] confidence
[14:29] not guilt that's right and this is the
[14:32] way that we come completely free nothing
[14:35] between us we stand there with no
[14:39] Shadows of Doubt how many would like to
[14:41] worship with no Shadows of doubt in your
[14:44] system at
[14:47] all see is that possible obviously the
[14:50] scripture is talking about it that we
[14:52] stand with no Shadows of doubt this is
[14:56] the way that we should come before the
[14:58] Lord
[15:00] this is the way we should come to
[15:04] church did you know that there's a way
[15:06] to come to church let me step back a
[15:08] minute did you know how you're created
[15:10] as a human being you know one of the
[15:12] things I find with people is they
[15:13] haven't studied themselves to know how
[15:16] we tick as a human being and I find the
[15:18] devil has studied human beings a lot
[15:20] better than we have he knows how the
[15:22] human being ticks and besides that he
[15:25] has studied you personally your whole
[15:27] life like a boxer studies his enemy and
[15:30] the boxer studies he get a box he
[15:32] watches videos of them he knows where to
[15:34] get you where your weak spots are Satan
[15:36] has studied you your whole life and
[15:39] knows your weak spots he's he's
[15:42] committed to doing it he's done it your
[15:44] whole life and sometimes he understands
[15:46] you better than you understand yourself
[15:49] that's why he gets you all the time
[15:51] because there are per particular
[15:52] weaknesses with one person that it's a
[15:54] weakness with them it may not be a
[15:56] weakness with another person but it's
[15:57] you and it's where the devil get you how
[15:59] can he get you there because he studied
[16:01] you he knows this is where I can attack
[16:03] this is where I can get him but you
[16:05] haven't studied yourself enough to know
[16:07] when we come through the sexual
[16:08] Temptation classes and last fall we were
[16:11] we were uh we were talking about those
[16:13] things and that you can not only study
[16:15] the word and the scriptures first of all
[16:17] be filled with the Holy Ghost then we
[16:19] study the scriptures so we can use the
[16:20] word against the enemy in the temptation
[16:23] but then we study ourselves and know how
[16:26] we function because there's certain
[16:27] things one man can do that another man
[16:30] can't do he can't go there because it's
[16:32] a temptation to them so I thought I'd
[16:34] bring that in is that you know we have
[16:36] to we have to uh study ourselves but
[16:40] then there's a way that we come to
[16:42] church there's a way if we know how
[16:45] we're built as a human being it's hard
[16:47] to get in the spirit and the flow of
[16:49] what the Lord's presence would be to
[16:51] speak to you if you come without some
[16:55] preparation so I have to stop as a
[16:58] pastor and teacher this because I know
[16:59] some of you don't know it I know some of
[17:02] you you haven't thought of church or the
[17:05] maybe the Lord or preparing your heart
[17:08] getting stuff out and just getting
[17:09] released you haven't thought about it
[17:11] all week you've thought about this and
[17:13] that and the other and business and
[17:15] everything else you haven't give church
[17:17] a thought you haven't prayed for the
[17:19] pastor you haven't prepared your
[17:22] heart if I'm rebuking yes I am a bit
[17:25] because people sometimes don't know
[17:27] there's a preparation that we as human
[17:29] beings have to do to get into the spirit
[17:32] there's a releasing of things Lord I'm
[17:35] praying for that man of God I know he's
[17:37] studying I know he's in prayer but I'm
[17:39] in prayer and I'm put in an atmosphere
[17:41] because I'm prepared myself to meet
[17:44] you and then God and His grace then some
[17:47] of you come you've got everything on
[17:49] your mind and the deacons have asked you
[17:51] to leave your phones somewhere else
[17:53] besides in here and and you you've You'
[17:56] you're turning them on in church and
[17:58] checking business and everything you
[17:59] come with all kinds of things on your
[18:01] heart unresolved all these things well
[18:04] brother Paul I come to get help but you
[18:06] see how much better would it be is to
[18:08] prepare and release things and worship
[18:10] freely how much better would it
[18:14] be I may have to preach this without too
[18:16] many amens because too many of us don't
[18:19] pray to prepare our hearts and to
[18:21] release our hearts and say come in and
[18:24] so we're depending on brother Gideon and
[18:26] brother Michael to pull us out of our
[18:27] mlly grubs and to help us get our hearts
[18:30] all freed up by the time brother Paul
[18:32] preaches that's not really the way
[18:33] you're supposed to do
[18:35] [Applause]
[18:39] it might be good to do some praying
[18:42] Saturday night instead of watching that
[18:44] movie till midnight or 1 in the
[18:48] morning and then you watch till 1 in the
[18:50] morning and this is the kind of Isaac I
[18:52] get what I'm preaching this kind of eyes
[18:54] I get
[18:58] and I yell and I wake you up and then
[19:00] you drift off
[19:02] again maybe you should give you should
[19:04] have Give the Lord a little bit more
[19:06] priority than that but you don't
[19:08] understand you don't understand some of
[19:10] the basic things of how we work and that
[19:13] we are called not just to live in this
[19:16] world and make money and we're called to
[19:19] be
[19:21] worshippers yes and it's not just in
[19:24] church we worship in our lives we
[19:26] worship in our testimony we worship when
[19:29] we're in the word we worship in our
[19:31] tithes and offerings and our giving we
[19:33] we we are worshippers can you say Amen
[19:36] we are wor worshippers when we're
[19:37] witnessing to somebody we're worshippers
[19:39] when we do go make a business decision
[19:41] we're worshippers so we say Lord I'm
[19:43] going to worship you today I need
[19:45] leadership in this decision I'm going to
[19:46] make we are not called to be like the
[19:48] rest of the world we are
[19:51] worshippers Jesus prophesied of some of
[19:54] you maybe all of you he said to the
[19:56] woman at the well one day the true
[19:58] worship shers will be on the face of the
[20:00] Earth who will worship God in spirit and
[20:02] in
[20:03] truth I believe I'm preaching to some of
[20:06] them here this morning can you say Amen
[20:08] we're called to be worshippers in the
[20:09] last days but you can't worship with a
[20:11] condemned
[20:13] heart and so there's a certain
[20:15] preparation there's a certain getting
[20:17] ready there's a certain of preparing us
[20:20] to come this may be basic to you this
[20:22] morning you cannot have a heart that's
[20:24] clogged that's bogged down that's
[20:27] burdened it must be
[20:30] released so that you can worship freely
[20:33] and that you can receive the word
[20:37] freely instead of a block instead of a
[20:41] wall up instead of being all locked up
[20:45] in your hearts can you say
[20:48] Amen so we need to come to church get
[20:51] our hearts
[20:53] ready to come perfectly clear if at all
[20:56] possible if you have needs things you
[20:59] don't understand to bring those things
[21:00] to the altar bring those things to God
[21:02] to clear it up to be cleared up to be
[21:04] ready uh but sometimes with the Shadows
[21:07] you're hoping brother Gideon and the
[21:09] music crew can cast off help you cast
[21:11] off some of those troubles and make you
[21:13] forget them for a couple hours I don't
[21:15] want you to forget your troubles for a
[21:17] couple hours in church I want you to
[21:20] receive the power of redemption and
[21:23] atonement that you would be released can
[21:25] you say Amen that you can go back as a
[21:27] Victorious Christian on
[21:31] Monday
[21:32] Hallelujah that's not the way that comes
[21:34] so we should learn how to come to church
[21:35] we come this way and even if our hearts
[21:38] has
[21:39] condemnation here here's the next truth
[21:41] now we're just taking it little by
[21:43] little even if our hearts has
[21:47] condemnation God is
[21:50] greater than the
[21:54] condemnation oh now I can preach do you
[21:58] have that Revelation or does
[22:00] condemnation in the heart overwhelm you
[22:02] and it's more important till God can't
[22:04] work in your life but you see now we
[22:06] almost we almost always must remember
[22:08] the Revelation that no matter how much
[22:11] condemnation the devil uses in our heart
[22:14] God is greater than our
[22:17] heart that means that what God says
[22:19] about you can be different than what
[22:23] your heart is saying about you the heart
[22:26] is the seed of your emotions it's not
[22:29] your
[22:30] soul so your heart can be saying
[22:33] something different than what God says
[22:36] about
[22:37] you but I'm here to tell you what God
[22:40] Said is about you to your soul is
[22:42] greater than what you hear in your
[22:45] heart God is greater than the
[22:49] condemnation that's in your heart the
[22:52] heart is the seed of the emotions voices
[22:54] can come from there condemning voices
[22:57] guilty voices voices condemnation voices
[23:00] but this conscience is a messy thing
[23:02] because it can be telling you stuff
[23:04] that's right but then it can be telling
[23:06] you stuff that's did like I teach the
[23:07] young people the heart the Bible says is
[23:09] deceitful above all
[23:11] things and then we got the songs that
[23:14] say follow your
[23:16] heart trust your heart you fell in love
[23:20] with this guy he's about 30 feet away
[23:23] but you have fallen in love what do I do
[23:26] follow your heart you don't follow your
[23:28] heart
[23:29] because the Bible says it's deceitful
[23:30] above all things and the thing with the
[23:32] heart like I tell young people you could
[23:34] come you can meet the guy you could
[23:36] start a relationship and the next day or
[23:38] the next week your heart could change
[23:40] and you can't stand
[23:42] them you were ready to order the flowers
[23:46] because your heart said this is the one
[23:48] right right but your heart can play
[23:50] games because he might pick his
[23:56] nose you might hear him snore
[23:59] you heard him blow his no nose he blew
[24:02] his nose and it was like a hurricane hit
[24:03] the
[24:05] room all of a sudden your heart's going
[24:09] I don't love this guy as much as I did
[24:10] before the next
[24:15] week that's why in marriage it's not
[24:18] about where your heart goes it's an
[24:22] absolute that my love has committed to
[24:24] them even if they snore bad
[24:30] even if they pick their nose well ladies
[24:32] you may work on him he might start to
[24:33] get better habits
[24:35] later but your marriage commitment is
[24:38] whether
[24:39] he picks his nose or
[24:43] not that's not in my notes that's that's
[24:47] free doesn't cost you a
[24:50] thing so now this conscience it's it's
[24:54] in all these areas this means that
[24:56] condemnation can be in your heart but
[24:58] it's not coming from the soul if you you
[25:02] know the scripture if you're in Christ
[25:05] there is no
[25:09] condemnation
[25:11] none when You' passed from Death unto
[25:14] life you don't go to the Judgment
[25:17] someday God judged you at Calvary God
[25:20] washed away your sins you stand
[25:23] Justified before the judge and so your
[25:26] conscience
[25:28] is in a state but the state you're
[25:31] conscious in is not your standing with
[25:34] the Lord
[25:36] right your state can be different than
[25:39] your standing your standing with the
[25:41] Lord doesn't
[25:44] change I need some of you to latch on
[25:46] and say Amen to
[25:48] that your standing with the Lord cannot
[25:53] change even though your conscience can
[25:56] wreak havit and be up and down and you
[25:58] don't have a clue what's going on your
[26:00] state that you're in does not change
[26:02] your standing the state that job was in
[26:05] did not change his standing with
[26:10] God and so God is greater if our hearts
[26:13] are condemning us hey latch on to the
[26:16] revelation God is greater than our
[26:20] hearts the state of your heart and any
[26:22] moment can never uh change your standing
[26:25] with God never change it some
[26:28] who make mistakes are still Sons when my
[26:32] children made mistakes I didn't kick
[26:34] them out of the home why they were born
[26:36] in my family there's sons and
[26:38] daughters and they have made mistakes
[26:40] and we sons of God have made mistakes
[26:43] but it never changes our standing as
[26:45] Sons and Daughters can you say
[26:48] amen I need some of you who are
[26:50] constantly Bound by the condemnation of
[26:52] the devil whether by the that you've let
[26:54] him in or it's a past Ministry you're
[26:57] under I need you to I preach these for
[26:59] your Victory you have to latch on to
[27:01] this for yourself and you have to say
[27:04] God is greater than the condemnation in
[27:07] my heart no matter where it's come from
[27:09] my standing never changes even though my
[27:12] state of my heart can be up and down God
[27:15] and his thoughts of you will always be
[27:18] greater than the condemnation of your
[27:20] heart Grace will always be greater than
[27:24] sin
[27:28] has proved it time and again Grace will
[27:32] always be greater than your sin we're
[27:35] reading the rest of First John because
[27:37] we think we leave it alone if there's
[27:39] condemnation in our heart I'm ignore
[27:40] that and I'm going on because God is
[27:42] greater than my heart he is greater than
[27:44] your heart but look at the rest of the
[27:45] scriptures look at the next one beloved
[27:48] if our heart verse 21 beloved if our
[27:50] heart condemn us not then have we
[27:55] confidence toward God and whatsoever we
[27:58] ask we receive of him so now it doesn't
[28:00] end of holding the condemnation there
[28:03] greater Victory is that we would release
[28:07] the condemnation that's there thank you
