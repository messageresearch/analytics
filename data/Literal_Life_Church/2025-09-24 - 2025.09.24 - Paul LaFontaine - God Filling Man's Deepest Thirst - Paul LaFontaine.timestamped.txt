[0:01] [Music]
[0:02] I have a maker.
[0:10] He formed my heart.
[0:18] Before
[0:20] even time began,
[0:24] my life was in
[0:27] his hand.
[0:30] Sing it with all your heart tonight. He
[0:32] knows. He knows my name.
[0:38] [Music]
[0:40] And he knows my every
[0:45] thought.
[0:48] And he sees each tear that falls.
[0:54] And he hears me when
[0:58] I call.
[0:59] I have a father. Hallelujah. Oh,
[1:03] I have a father.
[1:09] Thank you, Lord. And he calls me his
[1:13] own.
[1:16] [Music]
[1:18] He'll never
[1:21] leave
[1:23] me.
[1:25] No matter where I go,
[1:31] for he knows
[1:33] and he knows my name
[1:41] and he knows my every
[1:45] thought.
[1:47] [Music]
[1:48] And he sees each tear that falls.
[1:55] And he hears of me when I call.

[3:59] clap of praise to the Lord. We're free

[4:20] we want to just sing that praise unto
[4:22] you, God, knowing, God, that you brought
[4:24] true liberty, God. You t brought true
[4:27] freedom from the slaves we once were.

[5:35] Amen. Praise the Lord. Thank you, God.
[5:38] Hallelujah. Let's sing this song tonight
[5:41] as we greet each other in the name of
[5:43] the Lord. I'm rich in faith and hope and
[5:46] love. I'll have more than my share. I'll
[5:50] be moving to a mansion just over in

[6:28] got more than my share. I'll be moving
[6:31] to my man over in glory where I'm a
[6:35] rightful heir.
[6:38] First verse. Oh, my father owns a cattle
[6:42] on a thousand hills. I believe I own
[6:46] one. I stand amazed to see his face
[6:50] knowing that I'm his son.

[7:01] to my man just over in glory where I'm a

[22:07] Amen. Amen. Amen. May God just bring us
[22:11] into his potter's house tonight and mold
[22:13] us and make us into what he wants us to
[22:16] be. And uh when he does that, he just
[22:19] shows that he is a faithful God and that
[22:21] he's willing to continue to make us into
[22:24] the masterpiece that he's called us to
[22:26] be and what he's seen of us in his mind
[22:28] before the foundation of the world. And
[22:30] I'm so glad to put a trust in a God that
[22:33] way tonight. Praise the Lord. I'm really
[22:35] rejoicing in the testimony about the
[22:37] babies, Sister Lena's babies in the
[22:39] Quinland family. Um, I got some pictures
[22:41] of them uh earlier today and it is a
[22:45] real miracle. Uh, they're preeis yet,
[22:48] but it's a miracle that they've turned
[22:49] out healthy, both of them. And that's
[22:52] been an answer of prayer. I was really
[22:54] interceding for them and some other
[22:55] needs in the church here in the
[22:56] sanctuary. I think I was in here uh
[22:59] yesterday uh studying all day and I just
[23:02] come in and had a wonderful time with
[23:03] the Lord here in the sanctuary and took
[23:05] some very urgent needs here in the
[23:07] church and that was one of them. So I'm
[23:09] rejoicing the Lord answered and gave
[23:11] sister Elena her babies and I pray God
[23:14] will watch over them now and as they
[23:16] just move out of this preemy state and
[23:18] may God be with them and praying for the
[23:20] other needs as well in rap and rap and
[23:22] leth being mentioned I think it is their
[23:25] anniversary today so if you're listening
[23:28] happy anniversary to brother Rap leth
[23:30] God bless you both on this day what a
[23:33] weekend we had what a Sunday it wasn't a
[23:35] weekend it was one day we did a whole
[23:36] weekend in one day and It was uh
[23:39] glorious and we're looking forward to
[23:41] getting those available. They're already
[23:42] on your church telegram and also the
[23:45] powerpoints are there too and you're
[23:47] welcome to go back through those and
[23:49] study those for the family and we'll be
[23:51] adding brother Steve Brassan's on a
[23:53] special page now to be able to go to and
[23:55] send your friends and anyone who's
[23:57] interested in all the teachings. Years
[23:59] ago I did a whole I don't know 10 weeks
[24:02] or something on blessed families and
[24:04] broke down some things. So, we'll put
[24:06] all those in one resource and you'll be
[24:07] able to explore the different subjects
[24:10] related to the family. Praise the Lord.
[24:13] If you turn in your Bibles tonight to
[24:15] Psalms 42, we'll read a portion of
[24:18] scripture together and break bread
[24:19] together tonight. Thanks for coming out
[24:22] and thanks for listening in. And I know
[24:24] the Lord always has something in mind
[24:26] for us. Psalms chapter 42. We ask for
[24:29] your prayers, too, as we minister at the
[24:31] men's meeting in Tennessee this weekend.
[24:33] A couple services. That's always a
[24:35] special time. I didn't get to go last
[24:36] year and we'll be contributing to a
[24:39] couple of the services, but we're
[24:40] looking forward to that. So, we ask for
[24:41] your prayers. Brother Boaz Romero will
[24:44] be carrying the word of the Lord here at
[24:46] home. Psalms chapter 42 and verse one.
[24:50] As the heart or the deer panteth after
[24:53] the waterbrooks, so pantth my soul after
[24:56] thee, oh God, my soul thirsteth for God,
[25:01] for the living God. When shall I come
[25:03] and appear before God? My tears have
[25:06] been my meat day and night, while they
[25:07] continually say unto me, "Where is thy
[25:10] God?" When I remember these things, I
[25:12] pour out my soul in me. For I had gone
[25:15] with the multitude. I went with them to
[25:18] the house of God, with the voice of joy
[25:20] and praise, with a multitude that kept
[25:23] holy day. It's interesting that David is
[25:25] saying here, I was going to church. I
[25:27] was attending and uh the voice of joy
[25:30] and praise and I was attending with my
[25:32] friends the house of God. And yet he's
[25:34] still speaking of an earnest thirst
[25:36] within himself for more of God. So just
[25:39] because we're coming to church doesn't
[25:41] necessarily mean it's always filling the
[25:43] full thirst for God. It has to be an
[25:46] everyday affair. Has to be always going
[25:49] to the fountain for him to fill that
[25:50] void. Because David's going to church
[25:52] here and yet he still has this yearning.
[25:55] Verse six. Oh my God, my soul is cast
[25:58] down within me. Therefore will I
[25:59] remember thee from the land of Jordan of
[26:02] the Hmonites and from the hill Mazar.
[26:05] Deep calleth unto the deep. How many
[26:07] remember brother Brandon referring to
[26:09] this in a couple services and also the
[26:12] film that we have and him ministering on
[26:14] this subject deep calleth unto the deep.
[26:16] That statement right there says so much
[26:19] in it. There's a deep when there's a
[26:21] deep calling there's a deep to respond.
[26:23] If there's something deep within us, God
[26:26] put that in there. And if he we have a
[26:29] thirst within us that's deep, then God
[26:31] also provided the place for that to get
[26:33] quenched. Isn't that wonderful? So when
[26:36] there's a deep calling out for
[26:37] something, then there's something uh
[26:39] deep to respond to it. Deep calleth
[26:42] under the deep, but the noise of thy
[26:44] water spouts. All thy waves and thy
[26:46] billows are gone over me. Yet the Lord
[26:48] will command his loving kindness in the
[26:50] daytime and in the night his song shall
[26:53] be with me and my prayer unto the God of
[26:56] my life. May the Lord adds blessings to
[26:59] the word tonight. God bless you. You may
[27:01] be seated.
[27:03] There's a couple of messages in 1965
[27:06] that I encourage you to listen to and u
[27:09] I believe that they're prophetic of the
[27:11] age that we live in and I'm going to be
[27:14] speaking a little bit out of those
[27:15] tonight and also some other things. But
[27:17] those two messages from the prophet are
[27:20] in 1965 and one's called broken sistns
[27:23] and one is called the message thirst. So
[27:26] I've been uh studying those a little
[27:28] bit. Encourage you to look at them. And
[27:31] I believe that these two messages are
[27:33] very prophetic of the times we live in.
[27:35] They're very instructive. There is great
[27:38] revelation in here for the sons of God.
[27:40] And through the a couple these both both
[27:42] these messages I believe the sons of God
[27:45] at the end time uh gain a a deeper
[27:48] revelation of some deeper things that we
[27:50] wouldn't have known as deeply before and
[27:53] what is that is that we learn the nature
[27:56] of the age in the first sermon broken
[27:58] sistrance we learn the the nature of the
[28:00] age and that is we have a bunch of
[28:03] replacement things uh brought by Satan
[28:07] that are places to drink from but they
[28:09] are broken sisters. So, it's it's
[28:12] showing the age that we live in that
[28:14] never have we lived in a time that Satan
[28:16] has provided alternative
[28:19] places to go and drink with thirst that
[28:21] we have within us. They're broken
[28:23] sistns. They don't hold water. He talked
[28:26] about the wiggle being in them. It's not
[28:28] fresh from coming from something deep.
[28:30] It's man-made. It's been comes off the
[28:33] water off the top of the barn. And yet,
[28:35] can you imagine somebody drinking from
[28:36] that? We know the animals would. But
[28:38] when someone that's all they have to go
[28:40] to, then the whole scenario and the word
[28:43] picture he gives us is this. This is
[28:44] what mankind has begun to drink from is
[28:47] brokenists full of just trash and full
[28:50] of junk in it and wiggle tales as he
[28:52] says and all these other things. So he
[28:54] is just showing the nature of the age.
[28:58] And then I believe in the next service
[29:00] thirst, it's showing how we are made as
[29:03] humans and also as sons of God. And that
[29:06] is that we have Godgiven thirst within
[29:10] us that is meant to be filled and
[29:13] quenched by God. And he goes into such
[29:16] description of thirst. One of the things
[29:18] I've learned from that message when I
[29:20] was a young man is that many of the
[29:22] thirsts that's within us that are even
[29:24] natural thirst, thirst for fellowship,
[29:26] thirst for joy, we'll mention a few of
[29:27] them here in a minute, thirst to be
[29:29] married, thirst all the all these are
[29:32] pure pure thirst. uh they're not
[29:35] perverted until Satan takes you to a
[29:38] perverted place to fill them. But but we
[29:41] as human beings both spiritually,
[29:44] naturally, and emotionally have thirst,
[29:47] God godgiven pure thirst within us. And
[29:50] they're not impure until we take them to
[29:52] the wrong place. So uh that message
[29:55] thirst is is just summing up in what it
[29:58] is. The first one the broken sistns is
[30:02] to show the nature of the age that we
[30:04] have many broken sistns. The next one
[30:06] thirst is really to show how we as human
[30:09] beings are made up and how we as sons of
[30:12] God are made up. The nature of the age
[30:15] is to provide all kinds of alternative
[30:17] fountains to quench our thirst. Even our
[30:19] god-given thirst, Satan has alternatives
[30:22] to fill a god-given thirst. Broken
[30:25] sistrance reveals this. And then our
[30:27] nature and the way God has made us is
[30:30] revealed. And it reveals to us that
[30:32] there are certain thirsts within us. And
[30:34] I pray that everybody's listening. There
[30:36] are certain God-given thirsts within us
[30:39] that are only to be filled by God and
[30:42] his fountains that he gave us to drink
[30:44] from. And every time we compromise and
[30:47] try to fill a God-given thirst somewhere
[30:49] else, we always get in trouble.
[30:53] &gt;&gt; And so this is this is greatly
[30:55] revealing. Maybe you're sitting here
[30:56] saying tonight, "Well, I've already
[30:57] heard this before." Well, just hang on a
[31:00] little bit because you might hear it
[31:01] just a little bit different than you've
[31:02] heard it before and it would be able to
[31:05] help you because this is the sum of it
[31:07] is that God fulfills man's deepest
[31:10] thirst within him. And if we don't
[31:12] understand, sometimes we end up in uh
[31:15] trouble in life and there things
[31:18] happening and we often try to blame
[31:20] other people for it or try to figure out
[31:22] the problem. And you'll find most things
[31:24] that happen that are troubling or most
[31:27] things that happen and we blame other
[31:29] people, it's actually the real need is
[31:31] that we have something deep within us,
[31:34] some need that we have that's not being
[31:36] met.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; And we're trying to figure out why am I
[31:40] acting this way? Why did I do this? Why
[31:41] did I make this mistake? And a lot of
[31:43] times there's a deep thirst that's not
[31:46] being quenched in God. And you tried to
[31:48] fulfill it somewhere else, but we're
[31:50] always trying to come up with the
[31:50] answers. this happened and this person
[31:53] did me wrong and this person and we're
[31:55] always trying to but most of the time if
[31:56] we'll grow up we realize we have to be
[31:59] aware that God puts within us deep
[32:02] thirst and when deep thirst are not
[32:04] being met it runs into trouble in our
[32:06] lives and so so there's God-given thirst
[32:09] within us both natural and spiritual and
[32:12] they are pure these I'm just going over
[32:14] the things that we learn uh in the
[32:16] basics of some of these services we have
[32:20] uh god-given and thirst within us. Both
[32:22] natural thirst and spiritual thirst and
[32:25] they are pure. They are physical, they
[32:28] are emotional, uh they are spiritual
[32:30] needs and they are needs that are within
[32:33] us. And then now there's levels of these
[32:36] thirsts. Some are more surface thirst
[32:39] and some are more obvious, but some of
[32:42] those thirsts within us are deeper and
[32:44] they're not more obvious and they're
[32:46] harder to detect.
[32:48] Some are surface needs, but some are
[32:52] deep needs. Everybody understand? And it
[32:55] takes a while to listen to the warning
[32:57] signs of deeper needs that are within
[33:00] us. It's easy to catch the ones that are
[33:02] just surface and the uh uh uh uh things
[33:05] that are more obvious. For example, and
[33:08] I'm going to be real basic for everybody
[33:09] here tonight for even a child can
[33:12] understand it. Uh a basic need for the
[33:15] body for for anybody's body is to be
[33:18] cleaned, to take a bath. Uh that's a
[33:20] basic need. And if you ignore that long
[33:22] enough, u there's problems that would
[33:25] come from not taking a bath. This is
[33:27] real basic teaching here tonight. And
[33:29] that is you have a need. There's a
[33:30] there's a need for your body to be
[33:32] cleaned. Uh my teeth need to be cleaned.
[33:34] Uh every day we need to brush our teeth.
[33:36] I tell my granddaughter that. I try to
[33:38] live by that myself. And the thing is is
[33:40] that if if I ignored that, uh, if I
[33:45] ignored that thing that I'm supposed to
[33:46] do every day, uh, well, they always
[33:49] taught us as kids, you know, if you
[33:50] ignore your teeth, they'll go away. How
[33:52] many's ever heard that before? So that's
[33:54] what the dentist tells you. If you
[33:55] ignore your teeth, they'll go away. And
[33:57] that's actually tied to what Brother
[33:58] Bram says because he said, if you ignore
[34:00] a thirst long enough, then it then you
[34:03] don't have it as strong anymore.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; Surely
[34:05] &gt;&gt; because you just ignored it. You you
[34:07] pushed it off. So going in the basic
[34:10] surface needs here. Uh my teeth need to
[34:12] be clean and if I ignore it, it's so
[34:14] surface that everyone else would
[34:17] eventually pick up on the fact the guy
[34:18] hasn't brushed his teeth and his breath
[34:20] is terrible. My wife would be the first
[34:22] one to alert me to the fact that that
[34:25] need was not being met. But everybody
[34:27] else, so that's why I'm saying some
[34:29] things are so surface you can see them.
[34:31] And if you ignore them, everybody else
[34:33] is going to pick up on it. Everybody
[34:34] else is going to smell your breath.
[34:36] Everybody else is going to it's going to
[34:37] be an easy conclusion. There's a need
[34:40] here. Hello. Brush your teeth, please.
[34:43] Or I'm not going to want to be around
[34:45] you very much. Please go brush your
[34:48] teeth. That's very basic. We we start to
[34:51] we start to realize some things are
[34:52] surface. And if if if you don't meet
[34:55] those things, some needs become obvious
[34:58] and the warning signs become obvious. A
[35:00] a simple example of that would be
[35:02] something more easy to detect would be
[35:05] you become hungry. And that's a that's
[35:07] something within us. You start to get
[35:09] hungry. People react to getting hungry
[35:11] in different ways, but but it's easy to
[35:13] detect. You you you're having uh you're
[35:17] just I got to eat, you know, I got to
[35:19] eat. And there's some people who become
[35:20] angry. I won't say who that is. They get
[35:23] irritated. And all these warning signs
[35:26] start to come. And brother Brandham used
[35:28] the term alarms in the thirst message.
[35:31] He says that these are natural alarms
[35:33] within us that start to be when you
[35:35] don't eat or you don't drink something.
[35:37] So these are physical. They're surface
[35:39] and they're pretty obvious when the
[35:41] alarm starts to go off and you've got to
[35:43] meet that need. You've got to meet that
[35:45] thirst. You've got to get something to
[35:47] eat. Unless the Lord has led you to a
[35:49] fast and that's a different thing. But
[35:51] you you're the you're going to go
[35:53] because it's there's an alarm going off.
[35:55] you're getting hungry and you you've got
[35:57] to eat something. But so you have those
[35:59] surface things, but then there are some
[36:02] thirst and some needs that are so deep
[36:05] within our spirit, in our soul, they're
[36:08] harder to detect and and and they're
[36:12] harder to know sometimes what you need
[36:14] for it and when you need it. So can I
[36:17] say that again? Deeper needs and thirst
[36:19] within us are harder to detect.
[36:23] And also, it's hard to detect what you
[36:25] need for that. And this is where Satan
[36:27] gets us. Because if you don't know what
[36:29] you need, if you don't know what's given
[36:31] for that thirst from God, you become
[36:34] vulnerable to Satan because he's going
[36:35] to present to you a broken sister, some
[36:38] alternative to drink from to meet that
[36:40] need because you don't know what you
[36:42] even need or when you need it. But there
[36:46] are some deep as as David is speaking
[36:49] about this deep calleth into the deep.
[36:52] He's even saying I'm going to church and
[36:54] praising God. But there's something
[36:55] deeper. I want a living God. I want
[36:57] something more than just church. There's
[36:59] something so deep that he actually says
[37:02] the deep calleth unto the deep the noise
[37:04] of thy water spouts. You know what he's
[37:06] saying? He said there's some there's
[37:08] some fountains that I can hear in the
[37:10] distance. There's water spouts and that
[37:13] which is in in me, God has provided some
[37:16] water, some some fountains and I'm
[37:19] hearing the thunder. When he says, "At
[37:21] the noise of thy water spouts, I'm
[37:23] hearing the thunder of the falls. I'm
[37:25] hearing the thunder, but I can't get to
[37:26] them yet. But I've got to take this
[37:28] thirst and I'm hearing the sound. I've
[37:30] got to get there because the deep is
[37:32] calling unto the deep."
[37:34] In other words, you're going to have to
[37:36] bring that together and quench that deep
[37:39] with what God's provided in that. And if
[37:42] it doesn't happen, we're in trouble.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; But it's it's something that David is
[37:48] saying that it's beyond just going to
[37:50] church. There is a depth within me for
[37:53] God. And whenever we have, that's why I
[37:55] love the song lately, take me deeper,
[37:58] because that's what my desire is. Take
[38:01] me deeper. And one of the ways to go
[38:03] deeper is to recognize how deep a son of
[38:06] God's um thirst for God goes. Don't ever
[38:10] cap off God. Don't never don't never
[38:12] plateau.
[38:14] Don't never say, "I'm good."
[38:18] Your thirst goes deeper than that. If
[38:21] you're a son and daughter of God, you
[38:23] say, "Well, I'm fine. I'm fine." You
[38:25] know, I'm I'm good. And I think it's
[38:27] good to rejoice in where you're at, but
[38:29] never say, "I'm finished. I'm done. I
[38:31] look good to everybody. I'm wearing the
[38:33] right clothes. No, no, no, no. Our
[38:35] thirst goes deeper than that. There's
[38:37] more of God for you. There's a deeper
[38:40] calling to the deep. And you've got to
[38:42] address that deeper thing so that you
[38:44] can grow deeper. You've got to address
[38:46] that. You can't ignore a deeper thirst.
[38:49] You can't cover it over reli with
[38:51] religion. You can't cover it over by
[38:53] being a message girl or a message guy.
[38:56] No, this is David is not talking about
[38:58] putting it on on the outside. He's not
[39:00] talking about going to church. He's
[39:02] saying, "I've got something deeper in
[39:04] here and it's a thirst for the living
[39:06] God and I'm even with my friends and
[39:09] they can't even meet that need, but God
[39:12] can meet it." Because if I have a deep
[39:14] within the deep, there's a deep to
[39:16] respond.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you have it, there's a
[39:20] God that can fulfill it.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; And don't stop searching until you find
[39:25] it.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[39:28] So
[39:31] if you're hungry, that's an obvious
[39:32] thing. But the deep things in our spirit
[39:34] and soul, they're harder to detect,
[39:36] harder to know what you need, harder to
[39:38] know when you need it, and what is
[39:40] needed to quench that need. And the
[39:43] prophet mentioned the different thirsts.
[39:45] And here they are. And these are all
[39:47] natural natural things. They're not
[39:49] they're not immoral. They're not uh bad.
[39:54] They're they're pure. He mentioned that
[39:56] we we have a thirst for success
[40:00] to be successful.
[40:02] Now how many people with that thirst in
[40:04] the world are trying to drink from
[40:06] another fountain to get success other
[40:08] than God?
[40:11] &gt;&gt; God said to Joshua, you follow these
[40:14] precepts. The first chapter, first
[40:16] verse, you follow me. He says, and I'll
[40:19] give you good success. He didn't say,
[40:22] I'll give you success. He said, "I'll
[40:23] give you good success." In God is good
[40:26] success. In the world is just success.
[40:28] But you have a thirst for success.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? And God gave you
[40:33] that thirst to succeed.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; We can uh preach against it, but you'd
[40:38] be preaching against who God made us.
[40:40] We're made as a people that has a thirst
[40:42] for success. He says he says you have a
[40:45] thirst for fellowship. He goes right
[40:47] into someone wanting to be married and
[40:48] he says it's not unnatural for a young
[40:51] man and a young woman to fall in love
[40:53] and be attracted to one another and want
[40:55] to marry one another. He says that's a
[40:57] that's a thirst for that fellowship,
[40:59] that kind of fellowship, that marriage
[41:01] fellowship. It's something it's not
[41:02] impure. It's not wrong. It's a pure
[41:04] thirst God puts within every human
[41:07] being. And those of us who are married
[41:09] tonight can testify and say, "I had that
[41:11] thirst. God quenched that thirst with
[41:13] the right person. And I'm happily living
[41:15] in contentment with that. I'm enjoying
[41:17] that because that thirst was met in God.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; But we also have a thirst for fellowship
[41:24] with every all the other pe uh the not
[41:26] just being married but others as well.
[41:28] We have a thirst for friendship. He says
[41:31] we have a thirst for fellowship. Then he
[41:32] goes on to say as a young kid he was
[41:34] kind of you know pushed aside. He didn't
[41:37] have any friends. He was made fun of and
[41:39] all these other things. So he had this
[41:40] craving for friends. Then as he grew, he
[41:43] says, "My friendship." He said, "My
[41:45] friend," he said, "I found that thirst
[41:48] to be fulfilled in the friendship with
[41:50] my Lord."
[41:52] God filled it first, but then God gave
[41:54] brother Brandham friends around the
[41:56] world. God knows how to fill that thirst
[41:59] for wanting friends. Now you're
[42:01] vulnerable if you have that thirst. And
[42:03] all of a sudden, now you teenagers
[42:05] listen, you have a thirst for friends.
[42:07] Watch Satan. If you don't get the right
[42:09] ones, he'll provide the wrong ones.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; So, your thirst is pure, but you went
[42:14] for the wrong kind of friends. You see,
[42:16] there he is right there at a young age
[42:18] taking your thirst, abusing those
[42:20] thirsts, redirecting you a wrong way to
[42:23] fulfill a God-given desire for friends.
[42:25] You should have friends. You should have
[42:27] fellowship. You should get married.
[42:31] Praise the Lord. I should have had an
[42:32] amen for that.
[42:34] He says it's in within women's is a
[42:37] thirst for beauty. Not in men,
[42:40] but women have a thirst, a god-given
[42:43] thirst. It's it's a it's actually a
[42:45] natural, it's not impure, a thirst for
[42:49] beauty and a a thirst to be pretty. That
[42:53] is a pure,
[42:55] God-given thirst within a woman. She
[42:58] wants to be pretty. And actually, she
[43:00] likes to hear that she's pretty, but
[43:02] even that needs to come from the right
[43:04] person.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; You see how how that works? Here's a
[43:08] woman. She's got a natural God-given
[43:11] thirst to want to be pretty and want to
[43:13] be uh acknowledged
[43:16] that she's pretty by her daddy and by
[43:21] her husband. So, you see what I'm
[43:23] saying? Now, she's got the thirst. And
[43:25] God's going to fulfill that thirst and
[43:27] quench that thirst to want to be pretty
[43:29] and be acknowledged that she's pretty by
[43:32] God-given men, God-given husbands,
[43:35] fathers, and God himself will give you
[43:39] the the asurances you need. But if a
[43:42] woman, if she doesn't have much of that
[43:44] from daddy or have much of it from her
[43:46] husband, she becomes vulnerable to
[43:49] somebody else quenching that thirst that
[43:51] she's pretty to somebody,
[43:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[43:54] &gt;&gt; She'll give her virginity to somebody at
[43:56] a young age because somebody was saying
[43:58] the right words and said, "I like you.
[44:00] You're beautiful. You're you're you're
[44:02] quite the Oh, and she and so now a
[44:05] god-given thirst becomes perverted
[44:08] &gt;&gt; because Satan provided someone else to
[44:10] quench that thirst.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; But the thirst to be pretty is not a
[44:14] wrong thing in a woman. It's not in a
[44:16] man. Thank God. Shouldn't be. You don't
[44:19] don't spend an hour on your hair.
[44:22] You shouldn't, brothers. But but the
[44:25] women do. You know, the bathroom's quite
[44:27] a mess after they get done. you know,
[44:29] it's everything's out and it's a it's a
[44:31] great project that happens in the
[44:33] bathroom and just leave them alone. You
[44:36] know, that's they do things uh you know,
[44:38] they do things different. News flash,
[44:40] women are different than men,
[44:45] right?
[44:47] And they think different and they do
[44:49] think and and and brothers, don't argue
[44:52] with women's choices because you were
[44:55] one of them.
[45:02] She has a thirst to be pretty and to
[45:05] receive attention for being pretty. That
[45:07] should come from the right fountains.
[45:09] It's all natural. He says, "A thirst for
[45:11] joy, a thirst for happiness, and a
[45:14] thirst for friendship."
[45:15] God, listen now. God not only put these
[45:18] things within us, but provides also
[45:21] Godgiven
[45:23] fountains to quench all of those thirst,
[45:27] both natural,
[45:29] spiritual,
[45:30] emotional.
[45:32] I want you to look at it like it's not
[45:34] just God provides the Holy Ghost for
[45:37] your soul, but I'm going to read you a
[45:39] scripture in a minute. He provides
[45:41] fountains to drink from for all of your
[45:44] thirst that are pure. And once we drink
[45:46] from a different one, we start getting
[45:48] in trouble.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; God is so great. He not only gives you
[45:53] the thirst, but he gives you a place to
[45:55] go drink that's pure as well
[45:57] &gt;&gt; that you can find. What do you think?
[45:59] What do you What happens when you go
[46:00] take a a fresh drink of water from a
[46:03] from a pure source when you're thirsty?
[46:06] What happens? Oh, contentment,
[46:09] satisfaction,
[46:10] joy sets in. That tasted so good. And
[46:14] there's no wiggle tails in it. There's
[46:16] it's not it's pure water. That's why a
[46:17] lot of us in this generation are
[46:19] drinking uh pure water. In other words,
[46:21] we're drinking bottled water because
[46:22] it's because it's it's not like going
[46:24] out here. We don't trust the city water
[46:26] even. There's all kinds of chemicals in
[46:28] it, right? And so now we'll do that.
[46:30] We'll buy a bunch of bottled water, but
[46:32] then we'll in our spirit or emotions go
[46:35] to other fountains to drink from.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; But all the contentment that you take
[46:40] that drink when you're in school and you
[46:42] were so hot and you went to that water
[46:44] fountain. My dad used to say about
[46:46] lukewarmness. He says there's nothing
[46:48] worse when you're hot and taking a drink
[46:50] and it's lukewarm water and you do what
[46:52] Jesus did in Revelations 3. You spill it
[46:55] out.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; You'd rather have hot water. God says,
[47:00] "I'd rather have hot or or cold." But
[47:02] when you're thirsty and you go to that
[47:05] fountain and it's pure, clean, cold
[47:09] water, it just feels good. And I'm here
[47:13] to tell you as believers, there is a
[47:16] deep satisfaction and contentment in
[47:19] your life. Maybe you even haven't found
[47:22] as much yet when you start turning to
[47:25] God's fountains to quench all of your
[47:27] thirst.
[47:30] So, Satan has alternatives that he's
[47:33] formed to drink from. Um, and notice in
[47:36] broken sistns,
[47:38] the whole thing of a a sister or broken
[47:41] system is that they're not deep. They're
[47:42] shallow. They're temporary. They're
[47:44] contaminated because they're shallow.
[47:46] They have terrible effects if you drink
[47:48] from them. Why? They are not God-given
[47:51] places to drink. It's man-made. In order
[47:54] for Satan to develop other sources, and
[47:56] this is another part I want to get into
[47:57] here, in order for Satan to develop
[47:59] other sources to fill our God-given
[48:01] thirst and make them very appealing for
[48:04] you to go to drink from, he would have
[48:06] to understand a man and a woman quite a
[48:10] bit and how we tick and how we're made
[48:12] up. He would have to understand us
[48:14] pretty well in order to provide
[48:16] something so appealing for someone to go
[48:18] drink from another fountain. He would
[48:20] have to be very good. And a matter of
[48:23] fact, I'll say it this way. He he he
[48:26] would Satan has become a master at the
[48:30] study of the human being and the
[48:33] particular needs of a man and a woman.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; True.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; Satan has has a a master's degree in
[48:43] studying the human being. How many years
[48:45] does he have behind his degree? 6,000.
[48:47] Right?
[48:49] &gt;&gt; I've never heard of a 6,000-year degree,
[48:51] but that's what Satan has in studying
[48:54] human beings, how they tick, what makes
[48:57] what's their weaknesses, what what makes
[48:59] them fall, because that's his whole
[49:01] purpose, right? For you to turn from
[49:03] God's fountains and the Holy Ghost and
[49:05] all that and and accept something else.
[49:07] This is just as good. And so, that's his
[49:09] whole purpose. So, in doing that, he's
[49:11] got to study the human being. And not
[49:13] only does he has he studied the human
[49:15] being and how he works and how she works
[49:17] for 6,000 years, he has studied you.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; Particularly you since you were born.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; You all know that, right? Satan's not a
[49:26] dummy. Well, in a lot of ways he is,
[49:30] but you all know he's studied you,
[49:33] Solomon,
[49:35] Joseph,
[49:39] Ryan.
[49:42] He's studied you since you were born.
[49:45] And he's watched you. And he's watched
[49:48] when you're down.
[49:50] He's watched what brings what brings you
[49:53] when you're up, what brings you up, what
[49:56] brings you down, what arouses you, what
[49:59] makes you depressed.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Okay? He studied all this. He's It's
[50:04] just like Brother Bram said about a
[50:06] boxer. He don't just come in as somebody
[50:08] you don't know. He has studied that
[50:10] opponent with videos. He has watched all
[50:14] of his hits, all of his strikes, where
[50:16] his weak spots are. He studies him
[50:18] before that boxing day. And our enemy
[50:21] has studied us. The problem I have is we
[50:24] don't study the tactics of the enemy.
[50:27] And we don't study ourselves enough
[50:29] either. So I might say that Satan in
[50:32] some ways knows us better than we know
[50:36] ourselves.
[50:38] And maybe that's why we fall and make
[50:39] mistakes. Maybe that's why we're
[50:41] susceptible to temptation because he
[50:44] knows us maybe better than we know
[50:45] ourselves.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about knowing ourselves
[50:48] in the word. I'm talking about knowing
[50:50] ourselves in the word, who we are in
[50:52] Christ, but also knowing ourselves, our
[50:56] background, where we came from, how we
[50:58] tick, our ups, our downs, what what
[51:01] makes us happy, what makes us sad. uh if
[51:03] we haven't looked at ourselves as a
[51:05] human being, we are going to become a
[51:07] target to Satan because he has truly
[51:10] studied you and he's still in study with
[51:12] some of you. He's still studying you,
[51:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's good thing I'm
[51:17] excited about the subject here tonight
[51:19] cuz you're awful quiet. So, you know
[51:21] what? I'm going to give the devil a
[51:23] black eye tonight and you can respond or
[51:26] not, but I'm Is anybody in getting
[51:28] something out of what we're saying
[51:29] tonight? This is a an extremely
[51:33] important subject and David introduced
[51:35] it to us because there is a depth of a
[51:38] thirst within us and and and and God is
[51:42] standing there ready to fulfill
[51:46] and quench those thirst. I've seen
[51:49] families that are so and marriages so
[51:52] content, so happy and they do not need
[51:55] to turn to any other source
[51:59] to find that contentment. They're
[52:01] content.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; You know, contentment is a great
[52:05] commodity. It's a great priceless thing
[52:08] today because we have stuff flashed in
[52:11] front of us all the time that makes our
[52:14] life, you know, on social media I've
[52:16] said your life is just just crud. It's
[52:19] just nothing. You don't have nothing.
[52:21] Your vacations are,
[52:24] you know, but you look in there, oh,
[52:25] wow. Everything everybody has more
[52:28] things. Everybody's better than you.
[52:30] Everybody's made more money. And all of
[52:32] a sudden, that's why the depression
[52:34] rates go up. Especially in teenage
[52:36] girls, the depression rates go way up.
[52:39] And a lot of it is that I I'm not as
[52:42] pretty as them. I don't have what they
[52:44] have. I don't have as much money as they
[52:46] have. I can't go to the places that they
[52:48] have. And I can't even cook as good as
[52:50] they're cooking online.
[52:54] So, you know, this it it happens that
[52:58] way. and and and it h it it appeals to a
[53:01] certain thing and and we we have within
[53:04] us the way that we're made, but Satan is
[53:06] good at studying us and knowing us and
[53:09] knowing what causes us to fall and what
[53:12] causes us to look to something else to
[53:14] fulfill. Nothing like seeing a satisfied
[53:17] family, a satisfied marriage,
[53:19] contentment, uh just so just quenching
[53:23] their thirst, a husband and wife with
[53:25] one another, just quenching that thirst.
[53:28] There is no other fountain that they
[53:30] drink from than one another.
[53:34] Can I get an amen?
[53:36] And a Christian who's he doesn't need to
[53:39] be dabbling in the things of the world
[53:42] to meet all kinds of cravings within
[53:45] them. They've become content and
[53:47] satisfied. What the joy of the Lord is.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You know, I've told you
[53:54] about that farmer who had a beautiful
[53:56] farmhouse, beautiful place, and he just
[53:59] said he kind of got tired of taking care
[54:01] of it, and he said, "I want a new
[54:03] place." And called the realtor, set up a
[54:04] time. She went through the house said,
[54:06] "All right." And she went and made the
[54:08] the ad and the ad came in the paper for
[54:10] his farmhouse. He wanted to sell it. He
[54:12] was going to do something different. And
[54:15] here's the ad. And I'm a realtor, so I
[54:17] know, you know, you just beautiful
[54:21] fivebedroom, two-story farmhouse,
[54:25] surrounding porch, beautiful big barns,
[54:28] beautiful 10 acres. It goes on and on
[54:32] and on. and the farmer's reading it and
[54:34] he picks up the phone, calls the realtor
[54:36] and says, "Forget it. I'm not selling.
[54:40] I've been looking for a place like that
[54:42] all my life."
[54:44] What happened to him? He just become
[54:47] discontent
[54:48] with what God had given him. God had
[54:51] blessed him. You see, and that's Satan
[54:53] working in the realms of discontent to
[54:56] cause us to go drink from another
[54:57] fountain and not be happy with what God
[54:59] has given us. I've seen people
[55:01] completely content and happy in the Lord
[55:03] and the revelation that God's given them
[55:05] because that's a great price. How many
[55:07] knows that you can't put a price tag on
[55:08] the revelation God's given you in your
[55:10] soul?
[55:12] But I've seen people that way and God
[55:13] did bless their life later financially
[55:16] in every way. Why? Because God looked at
[55:18] him and said they're happy with their
[55:20] their low wage. They're just paying
[55:21] their tithe serving the Lord, but
[55:23] they're content about it. And God likes
[55:25] to see people content like that and
[55:27] happy like that because when he can you
[55:29] can be uh faithful over little then you
[55:32] can be trusted over more.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; He likes to see our attitude about it to
[55:37] to be a content attitude.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Paul said I found in my life now that
[55:43] whatsoever state I find myself in I'm
[55:46] content.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Wow. Help us Lord.
[55:51] So, uh,
[55:54] Satan understands I'm just going to say
[55:57] some more about this. I would venture to
[55:58] say that Satan understands the
[56:01] physiology and the psychology,
[56:05] the the very cells of how the brain and
[56:07] how the body works and the psychology,
[56:10] the behavior of man. You know, 6,000
[56:13] years of study and he has studied it.
[56:16] But that's not a good thing because that
[56:18] means that he could have the upper edge
[56:20] on us sometimes. He studied you. He
[56:23] knows man. He knows women. And he knows
[56:25] you. He has studied you personally and
[56:27] how you work, how you tick. I've said
[56:29] some of these things already, but I want
[56:30] to say it again because he knows what
[56:32] attracts you. He knows what your past
[56:34] is. He knows how your past is affecting
[56:37] you. Satan knows how your past is
[56:40] affecting you. And he capitalizes on
[56:42] that because maybe if there's
[56:44] unconfessed sin or maybe it's not
[56:45] unconfessed sin, maybe it's just a hurt
[56:47] or trauma there that's hurting your
[56:49] spirit. Satan knows what's happening and
[56:52] he's going to capize and continue to use
[56:54] it for bondage, to use it to hurt you,
[56:58] to use it to turn to other things. You
[57:01] see, and so Satan knows you. He knows
[57:03] your triggers. He knows your mistakes in
[57:06] life. He has a file on you
[57:08] &gt;&gt; with your name on it. He's kept a file.
[57:11] And every once in a while, he gets it
[57:12] out. He studies the entire file because
[57:15] he says, "This week, I'm going to come
[57:17] and I'm going to bring a temptation for
[57:20] Michael and I'm going to make it
[57:22] specific. But before I do, I'm going to
[57:24] go through his file and look at him from
[57:27] the very beginning. All of his hurts,
[57:29] all of his pains, all of his victories,
[57:31] all of his defeats, all of his trauma of
[57:33] his all like his ups and downs, what
[57:35] makes him depressed. I'm going to study
[57:37] the whole file before I present
[57:39] something this week to him.
[57:43] He studies it. He knows how to use it.
[57:47] Problem is, saints is that we
[57:50] tend to stay ignorant about ourselves.
[57:55] We had some sexual temptation classes
[57:57] here for the brothers, learning from the
[57:59] scripture how to overcome sexual
[58:01] temptation.
[58:03] Had a little criticism for it from a
[58:05] couple other churches.
[58:07] And uh I guess I can say this, you know,
[58:09] it's just us tonight, but I I didn't
[58:12] quite understand why we couldn't have
[58:14] classes helping to teach the men the
[58:16] word of God and the power of the Holy
[58:18] Ghost to overcome these things. I didn't
[58:20] know why they stumbled at classes
[58:22] because I know brother Brandham as a
[58:23] young pastor met with his teenagers and
[58:26] he says, "I had classes to teach them
[58:30] about sex and things."
[58:33] So, you know, we did this. But I I
[58:36] remember
[58:37] um one of the points I made to the
[58:39] brothers, it was this point I'm making
[58:41] to you tonight is that Satan has studied
[58:44] us and studied the human male for all
[58:47] these years, he knows how to tempt a
[58:50] man.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; But I said, "Is it amazing if we don't
[58:54] do our homework to study ourselves and
[58:57] how a man's brain is and they say, "Oh,
[59:00] that's all. We don't have to do that. We
[59:02] don't." Well, the battle of is in the
[59:04] mind. And Satan knows it's in the mind.
[59:08] And he knows how the mind works. I could
[59:11] go through the science tonight and tell
[59:13] you how the mind works because I've
[59:16] studied and see. And Satan knows how the
[59:18] mind works to trap a man in pornography
[59:21] or any other sexual temptation or the
[59:23] temptation of success or whatever it is.
[59:25] He knows how the brain works and he has
[59:28] studied it. But if he's studied it and
[59:31] we haven't, oh, I don't I got everything
[59:33] I need. I'm fine. We're being ignorant
[59:35] to how God has made us. And I believe in
[59:38] the message thirst. Brother Brandham's
[59:40] trying to say God has given us these
[59:42] thirsts. They come from God, but watch
[59:44] out for the enemy because going to he's
[59:47] going to pervert that pure f thirst.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; I believe we should study it. I believe
[59:52] we should understand ourselves. I
[59:54] believe at in the about middle age and
[59:56] maybe that's why men have mid-ag crisis
[59:58] is because if they weren't as much a
[1:00:00] success as what they thought they should
[1:00:02] be they start crashing and they have a
[1:00:05] midlife crisis and they start buying big
[1:00:07] toys and they start you know buying
[1:00:10] Vespas and you know they just go off the
[1:00:13] rail a little bit and so because but
[1:00:16] maybe it's because okay I failed and
[1:00:19] when a man a man a man gets his
[1:00:21] credibility a lot of times from the
[1:00:23] things he's accomplishing. That's why he
[1:00:24] likes to hear affirmations from the
[1:00:26] wives and and a compliment from the
[1:00:28] wife. I appreciate what you're doing.
[1:00:30] You're a hard worker. You're providing
[1:00:31] for the family. You give that constant
[1:00:34] praise to a man. I mean, he just he
[1:00:36] loves it because it's feeding something
[1:00:38] within him. There's something about him
[1:00:39] that likes that. But he if he ends up
[1:00:42] failing, something fails, his spirit
[1:00:45] gets very low. And most of the time, he
[1:00:47] hides it. He don't tell everybody. And a
[1:00:51] man is in a dangerous spot when his
[1:00:53] spirit gets low.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; He's vulnerable to temptation and the
[1:00:58] enemy
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; because Satan h he's depressed.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; He's low. Look what happened in his life
[1:01:05] and that thing failed. That business
[1:01:07] venture failed and he's feeling like a
[1:01:09] failure. And then he goes through maybe
[1:01:11] that's why some of the midlife is there
[1:01:12] is because it didn't turn out. Life
[1:01:14] didn't turn out the way that he planned
[1:01:16] or the way that he wanted it. And it's
[1:01:19] like now I'm in life now. Do I start
[1:01:21] over again? What do I do? Oh my
[1:01:23] goodness. And it's just his head's in a
[1:01:25] tail spin and he's he don't he don't he
[1:01:27] don't know what to do. And you know
[1:01:29] what, brothers, sisters,
[1:01:32] God understands midlife as well.
[1:01:36] God understands menopause because the
[1:01:39] prophet talked about it. He talked about
[1:01:41] it openly about his wife and about his
[1:01:45] daughter and when they went through
[1:01:46] certain things that a that a man doesn't
[1:01:48] go through quite that way. He had to
[1:01:50] understand he said brothers that's when
[1:01:51] you got to really be a real friend to
[1:01:54] her and be loving to her sweet to her.
[1:01:56] She don't he doesn't understand what
[1:01:58] she's going through and she doesn't even
[1:02:00] understand all that she's going through.
[1:02:03] But it's okay. Just hold on to God.
[1:02:06] You'll get through it.
[1:02:08] life just is just go you know and so now
[1:02:11] we see that if we don't study ourselves
[1:02:15] sometimes we become ignorant of
[1:02:18] ourselves and listen Paul says in the
[1:02:20] Bible we are not to be ignorant of
[1:02:23] Satan's devices he clearly says it we
[1:02:26] are not ignorant of Satan's devices
[1:02:29] so if we're not ignorant of Satan's
[1:02:31] devices there's another thing I don't
[1:02:32] think we should be ignorant of and
[1:02:33] that's the way God made us the way God
[1:02:35] formed us the way God made us with our
[1:02:38] weaknesses and our strength if we don't
[1:02:40] study ourselves and look at the mirror
[1:02:41] and say hey you know this is the way God
[1:02:44] made me but I know he's also made made
[1:02:46] me to be an overcomer and uh that we
[1:02:50] minimize our weaknesses and we
[1:02:51] capitalize on our strengths we give our
[1:02:54] strengths to God and then perfect
[1:02:56] strength in God comes from perfect
[1:02:58] weakness when we learn to depend on him
[1:03:01] brother Steven remember years ago did a
[1:03:03] a thing at camp about minimizing our our
[1:03:06] weaknesses is and capitalizing on our
[1:03:08] strengths. It was a wonderful thing. But
[1:03:09] you realize in God there's even a a a
[1:03:12] great revelation that God's perfect
[1:03:15] strength can come from our weakness.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; So what are we doing? We're we're giving
[1:03:21] it all to God. Here I am. I am who I am.
[1:03:24] I think Paul said that I am what I am by
[1:03:26] the grace of God. God's made me this
[1:03:28] way, but I'm not going to let the devil
[1:03:31] take the weaknesses of what I am. and he
[1:03:33] abuses them to bring me low and make me
[1:03:36] fall to temptation. I'm not letting him
[1:03:38] do that. I understand where I'm at. I'm
[1:03:40] I understand I'm depressed today. And I
[1:03:43] actually know why I got depressed today.
[1:03:44] I'm not talking about me. I'm talking
[1:03:46] about you.
[1:03:48] Okay, I see what's going on. I I see
[1:03:50] where I'm at. I've seen this happen
[1:03:52] before. I see why I'm low today. But I'm
[1:03:54] not going to let the devil take it to
[1:03:56] another day. I'm bringing it back. I'm
[1:03:58] going to give him glory. And now I see
[1:04:00] how this happens, how I get here. but
[1:04:03] also I know how to get out of it. Can I
[1:04:05] get an amen tonight? This is this is
[1:04:08] where we live in the victory of God is
[1:04:10] that we got the devil's number. We
[1:04:12] understand ourselves. We understand the
[1:04:15] word of God. And we're not ignorant
[1:04:17] people. We're not ignorant of Satan's
[1:04:20] devices.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; We're not called to be ignorant of
[1:04:24] ourselves. We're not called to be
[1:04:26] ignorant of Satan's devices. We are
[1:04:28] called to understanding of ourselves.
[1:04:31] revelation of ourselves. You say, "Well,
[1:04:34] man, I'm I'm 70 years old and I haven't
[1:04:36] figured myself out." Well, it's a good
[1:04:38] time to start.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Say, "God, help me to figure myself
[1:04:42] out." Quit comparing yourself with
[1:04:45] everybody else and they are a success.
[1:04:47] Stop looking at them.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; How has God made you? And how is the
[1:04:53] devil defeating you?
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Because you're always wanting to be
[1:04:57] someone else. God, this is who I am, but
[1:05:00] I'm no longer going to let Satan defeat
[1:05:02] me over it.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; There was a scripture in 1 Chronicles 12
[1:05:08] and verse 22. It speaks of the men of
[1:05:10] Issachar and they were men of
[1:05:13] understanding of their times. I believe
[1:05:17] that's the bride. We understand the
[1:05:19] times. We understand the culture we live
[1:05:21] in. Oh, I love to see young people rise
[1:05:24] up and they're young people of
[1:05:26] understanding. They're not duped by this
[1:05:28] society and and and social media.
[1:05:30] They're not duped by movies that trash
[1:05:33] their brain. They're not ignorant of
[1:05:35] Satan devices. They're rising this age.
[1:05:37] And they're young people of
[1:05:38] understanding. I know the age that I
[1:05:40] live on, live in. I know the country I
[1:05:43] live on. And I know the God who's going
[1:05:47] to make me an overcomer to this
[1:05:49] particular age.
[1:05:52] The men of Issachar were men of
[1:05:54] understanding of their times.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; That's powerful.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; In fact, I will remind Satan that in the
[1:06:03] last days is the days of the
[1:06:05] manifestation of the sons of God.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; This is the hour of the manifestation of
[1:06:11] the sons of God. That means they're
[1:06:13] finding their way back. Sons of God,
[1:06:16] they have an open book. It's a book of
[1:06:18] their identity. It's been handed to
[1:06:20] them. They have the answer to the
[1:06:22] devil's question. They have discovered
[1:06:24] who they are and they're rising as a
[1:06:27] mighty armor. Army. Can you say amen?
[1:06:30] All creation is waiting for the
[1:06:32] manifestation of the sons of God. And we
[1:06:34] always think that's power and this and
[1:06:36] that and the other and power to do this.
[1:06:38] But you see the power comes. The power
[1:06:40] is not orchestrated. The power is
[1:06:42] because the manifestation means the
[1:06:44] revealing of the sons of God. Who's
[1:06:47] revealing? It's not just God revealing
[1:06:48] them. This is my sons. The sons are
[1:06:51] receiving a revelation of who they are.
[1:06:55] And when they get that revelation, when
[1:06:57] the bride recognizes who she really is,
[1:07:00] she'll take a rapture. Can I get an amen
[1:07:03] tonight?
[1:07:04] Satan, the sons are on their way back.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; There's Can you say amen, friends? We
[1:07:11] had a a a sinborn man in our generation
[1:07:16] create squirrels like Adam did. We had a
[1:07:19] sin-born man come to his place and he
[1:07:22] spoke to a little fishy and says,
[1:07:23] "Little fishy, I give your life back."
[1:07:26] What does that say? The manifestation of
[1:07:28] the sons of God. They're recognizing
[1:07:31] their position.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Jesus wasn't sin born. Brother Brandham
[1:07:35] was. But look at the example we have.
[1:07:38] And it's saying to Satan, Satan, the
[1:07:40] sons are finding out who they are.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; They're not duped. They're not ignorant.
[1:07:46] They are finding out and they've got the
[1:07:49] upper edge on the enemy. How many days
[1:07:52] do you live with the other How many
[1:07:53] years have we live with the enemy with
[1:07:55] the upper edge on us because we don't
[1:07:58] understand ourselves?
[1:08:00] It's time that the people of God and the
[1:08:03] sons of God rise to the occasion with
[1:08:06] this open book before us and to say,
[1:08:08] "Satan, I know who I am. I know how God
[1:08:12] has made me. He's made me for a purpose.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; I am who I am. By the grace of God and
[1:08:18] my strengths and talents and even my
[1:08:20] weaknesses, God can turn it all around
[1:08:23] and he's going to get glory out of my
[1:08:25] life." Somebody ought to praise the Lord
[1:08:27] tonight.
[1:08:29] All creation is waiting for this hour.
[1:08:32] Positioned sons. They are overcoming
[1:08:34] like never before. Why? Recognizing the
[1:08:36] devil at every one of his tricks and
[1:08:39] recognizing that the God in them is
[1:08:41] greater than the God in this world.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; The days of the manifestation is the day
[1:08:46] of revealing and recognizing. Then the
[1:08:48] power comes with that. But the days of
[1:08:51] the manifestation of the sons of God is
[1:08:53] a day of revealing and recognizing
[1:08:57] by the sons.
[1:08:59] When problems rise in our life, as I
[1:09:01] said at the beginning, we look to why
[1:09:02] and maybe who to blame and why we're not
[1:09:05] happy.
[1:09:08] But now go into this thirst again. I got
[1:09:10] plenty of time. I'm watching the clock
[1:09:11] there. Go into this thirst again. We we
[1:09:14] look to why problems arise. Why this
[1:09:17] happened in my childhood? Why did this
[1:09:20] happen to have me? And we always trying
[1:09:22] to come up with the reasons and the
[1:09:24] blame and why are we're not happy. But
[1:09:27] most of the time
[1:09:29] things happen because there's a deep
[1:09:32] need within us that hasn't been met.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; I want you to chew on that.
[1:09:41] There's many surface things that come
[1:09:42] out, but a lot of times there's a need
[1:09:46] that has not been met in the Lord. And
[1:09:50] there's there's something there's a
[1:09:52] there's a need. And some of those needs
[1:09:54] are so deep even after you get married,
[1:09:57] that mate cannot fulfill that need. I'm
[1:10:00] going to marry that girl because you you
[1:10:03] got a certain need in your life and
[1:10:05] you're thinking that girl will meet that
[1:10:06] need. Well, she'll meet some needs.
[1:10:08] She'll meet some needs for fellowship,
[1:10:10] but if there's other deeper needs, that
[1:10:13] wife can't meet it.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; That husband can't meet it
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; because why? It goes deeper than that.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; And the deepest of your need, God has a
[1:10:21] fountain for you to drink from.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; So God has made us relational beings.
[1:10:30] Someone said one time that the quality
[1:10:32] of life is in the quality of our
[1:10:34] relationships.
[1:10:38] God has made us relational beings. We're
[1:10:40] not robots. Uh we're not bots. We're not
[1:10:44] uh you know, we're not
[1:10:47] AI. We're real.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; And someone has said because God has
[1:10:52] made us relational beings, someone has
[1:10:54] said the quality of life is in the
[1:10:56] quality of relationships. Observation
[1:10:58] has proved in the thousands of years of
[1:11:00] human beings that someone can have all
[1:11:03] the best things of life and all the
[1:11:06] benefits of life and they're still not
[1:11:07] content and they're still not happy.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; And many times it's because the
[1:11:12] relationships aren't right.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Everything's right, but the
[1:11:15] relationships didn't go right with God
[1:11:17] and with others. Solomon had all Solomon
[1:11:20] had everything. You read it there in
[1:11:22] Ecclesiastes, I believe it is. He had
[1:11:25] all riches, everything at his fingertips
[1:11:29] and he concluded all is vanity which
[1:11:32] means emptiness. Just that in itself,
[1:11:34] it's all emptiness. So those are you
[1:11:36] that are thinking say if I just had this
[1:11:39] if I could win that what is that lottery
[1:11:41] at now about um my nephew Stevie was
[1:11:46] teasing me about it and he said do you
[1:11:48] want to go in on it? you know, and I
[1:11:49] said, "No, I don't believe in that
[1:11:50] stuff." But he was teasing me about it's
[1:11:52] like 750 billion now or something like
[1:11:54] that. I don't know if anybody's won it
[1:11:56] yet, but you know, I see those people in
[1:11:58] the store, you know, paying the money,
[1:12:00] just getting that get and and they think
[1:12:02] that's that's going to be it. If I hit
[1:12:04] that, that's it. You know, a lot of
[1:12:06] those people still aren't happy after
[1:12:07] they have it.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Solomon had it all. He said, "All is
[1:12:13] vanity."
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; All is vanity and emptiness. If there's
[1:12:18] something inside not being quenched, our
[1:12:20] deepest needs
[1:12:23] are tied to connection and relationships
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; with God
[1:12:29] and with people,
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; not things.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Food needs a surface need. Eating needs
[1:12:38] a surface need. A new truck mean may
[1:12:41] make a surface need. You know, is there
[1:12:43] a surface? But the deepest things are
[1:12:46] tied to relationship with God and
[1:12:48] relationship with one another. If that's
[1:12:50] not going well, if there's a wall up
[1:12:51] between you and God, if there's
[1:12:53] condemnation in your life and it's
[1:12:55] keeping you just like Adam and Eve,
[1:12:57] hiding in the bushes, hiding behind the
[1:12:59] fig fig leaves and just sin does that.
[1:13:03] Sin that's hidden, it makes you hide,
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:13:08] And God still came out looking for them
[1:13:11] lovingly
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; saying, "Come out here.
[1:13:16] We don't want to come out. We've sinned.
[1:13:18] Come out here. Take those fig leaves
[1:13:21] off." He throws a bloody skin of an
[1:13:24] animal to him. He said, "Cover
[1:13:25] yourselves up with ease. Come on out.
[1:13:28] Come out." It's God that's drawing us
[1:13:31] out. You know why he was drawing him
[1:13:33] out? He says, "I miss my relationship
[1:13:36] with you.
[1:13:39] Satan broke our fellowship. And God
[1:13:42] wants fellowship with you more than even
[1:13:44] we want it. He wants that more than
[1:13:46] anything. And he was willing to say, "I
[1:13:49] know you sinned. I know what the serpent
[1:13:51] did. I know this is this is this bad?
[1:13:54] This is really bad." Because the ripple
[1:13:56] effect would be for thousands of years.
[1:13:58] And yet at that moment, as brother Ron
[1:14:00] Spencer has said, when a third of the
[1:14:03] angels fell, there was there wasn't
[1:14:05] anything that happened. But when God's
[1:14:08] son fell, he's running towards him
[1:14:10] saying, "Adam, where are you?"
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Because he's not an angel. He's a son.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; He's a daughter. And he's standing
[1:14:18] there, come out of come out of those
[1:14:20] bushes. Come out of there. Throw this on
[1:14:22] your body. This is the covering I have
[1:14:23] for you. But come out here. I want
[1:14:25] fellowship with you again. Even back in
[1:14:28] the garden, he's finding a place of
[1:14:31] fellowship because he doesn't want our
[1:14:33] works. He doesn't want our fig leaf
[1:14:35] religion. He doesn't want us to smear on
[1:14:37] the message. He wants your fellowship.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; He'll take care of your sin, but he
[1:14:43] wants your fellowship.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. I can love a God like
[1:14:48] that so deeply because he knows my
[1:14:50] deepest need. He knows my deepest
[1:14:53] mistakes and he still calls us out. Our
[1:14:56] richest, most satisfying feelings in
[1:14:58] life will come from our filling, filling
[1:15:00] up our cup with good relationship. There
[1:15:03] are things that make us happy. But God
[1:15:05] designed us that good relationships
[1:15:07] gives us something even deeper than
[1:15:09] happiness, contentment, and peace. It's
[1:15:11] not just that things are good
[1:15:13] vertically.
[1:15:15] Sometimes people think I'm good
[1:15:16] vertically, but things need to be good
[1:15:19] horizontally.
[1:15:20] True.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; God doesn't doesn't come and say, "As
[1:15:22] long as you're good with me, you don't
[1:15:24] have to care about anybody else." No,
[1:15:25] no, no, no. We're a relational being.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; So, we work on love is hard work.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; We work on why? Because of the devil
[1:15:34] mainly and because our human nature gets
[1:15:36] in the way. But listen now, love is hard
[1:15:38] work. But God doesn't want us to bless
[1:15:41] as what was it James who said those who
[1:15:44] bless God and curse men.
[1:15:48] said, "No, that that's not right."
[1:15:50] Because if you're vertically right,
[1:15:53] you're going to be horizontally right.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; He wants to bring contentment and affect
[1:16:01] our marriages and our families so much.
[1:16:03] And Jesus said, "I come to give you
[1:16:05] life, and I come not just to give you
[1:16:07] life, but to give you life more
[1:16:08] abundant."
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Added to, "I come that your joys
[1:16:14] may be full." Amen.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, we live in a an
[1:16:21] atmosphere around us that works against
[1:16:22] us. And we live in an atmosphere around
[1:16:25] us that works against the deep thirst
[1:16:27] that's within us. I just want to say
[1:16:29] that we live in a a culture and in a
[1:16:32] world and sometimes family life that's
[1:16:35] constantly working against the deep
[1:16:36] thirst that's within us to stop it, to
[1:16:39] to to not get it quenched. There's
[1:16:41] something within us. Satan is against
[1:16:44] the supernatural connection with God in
[1:16:46] man. When you have 6,000 years to form a
[1:16:49] world that is to replace and cut off the
[1:16:51] pure line from God for complete
[1:16:53] satisfaction and cut off a true oneness
[1:16:56] with God, it all turns into a deception
[1:16:59] of Eden, but it's Satan's Eden. Notice
[1:17:02] it's called an Eden, but it's Satan's
[1:17:04] Eden.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; We're at the climax of that. We're right
[1:17:07] in the middle of it. We live in a world
[1:17:10] of counterfeit happiness and joy. A
[1:17:13] devil that hates oneness. When Jesus
[1:17:15] said, "I and my father are one," they
[1:17:17] picked up stones get him, against him.
[1:17:19] The same hatred is uh brought by Satan
[1:17:23] today of anyone that's proclaiming, "I
[1:17:25] and my father are one or wanting to
[1:17:27] become one with him." He hates the
[1:17:30] effects of oneness in relationship.
[1:17:34] Satan hates it to this day because you
[1:17:36] know what that oneness does? You know
[1:17:38] what it did with Jesus when he said, "I
[1:17:40] and my father are one." It renders Satan
[1:17:43] powerless.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Oneness
[1:17:48] renders Satan powerless.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Put that one on your refrigerator this
[1:17:53] week.
[1:17:55] Oneness, true oneness, renders Satan
[1:17:58] powerless. Why? Because there's a bond.
[1:18:01] There's a glue so close and so tight
[1:18:06] Satan can't get in.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; He hates that. I tell you, I want to
[1:18:11] live a life where Satan's powerless.
[1:18:18] Satan keeps our relationship shallow,
[1:18:21] especially with God. Shallow, by the
[1:18:23] way, is the opposite of deep. You know
[1:18:25] that. So, Satan keeps our relationship
[1:18:27] even with God shallow.
[1:18:30] That's why he does it. to fight against
[1:18:31] real true oneness. God has made us that
[1:18:33] real true happiness comes from
[1:18:35] relationships being right without guilt
[1:18:37] without walls removing all fears. Not
[1:18:40] just with God but others as well. When
[1:18:43] there's a deep calling, there's a deep
[1:18:44] to respond and that means something
[1:18:47] weighed down deep within us. We're
[1:18:50] hearing David said, "I'm hearing the
[1:18:51] thunder and the noise of fountains from
[1:18:53] God. It's registering within me, but
[1:18:56] I've got to get there. I've got to get.
[1:18:58] That's why he said as the heart panteth
[1:19:00] after the water books. And brother Bram
[1:19:02] says when that deer is wounded, his only
[1:19:05] life is to get to that water cuz if he
[1:19:08] can drink, he can heal up. And so he
[1:19:11] runs towards the waterbrook. He's trying
[1:19:13] to find the water because he's been
[1:19:15] wounded. And if you don't find the
[1:19:17] water, he won't survive. This is what
[1:19:19] David says is a word picture to us is
[1:19:22] that that's how we need to crave God.
[1:19:24] When we're wounded, when we're
[1:19:26] depressed, we need to not turn to
[1:19:28] television and turn to books. We need to
[1:19:30] turn to our God. Can you say amen?
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Because he's the one that meets the deep
[1:19:36] calling to the deep.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The inner feeling.
[1:19:41] Brother Brand brings this out in in deep
[1:19:43] call to the deep in not only the film,
[1:19:45] but the service that he several services
[1:19:47] he preached about it. And then he brings
[1:19:49] this up. There's a deeper longing. And
[1:19:51] he brings up, how many brings remember
[1:19:53] he brings up the boy craving sulfur? He
[1:19:55] was eating the bicycle pedals because
[1:19:57] there was that the rubber had sulfur in
[1:20:00] it and they couldn't figure it out. He
[1:20:01] had an individual craving. Maybe not
[1:20:04] everybody else would have it, but he had
[1:20:06] a craving for sulfur. It wasn't being
[1:20:08] quenched. He found it and that's why he
[1:20:10] was eating those bicycle petals or
[1:20:12] eating off of them. He talked about
[1:20:14] another woman that was craving onions or
[1:20:17] something in onions and she died. And
[1:20:19] when they studied her body, that's when
[1:20:21] they found out she was craving. She had
[1:20:23] never got to that element, whatever was
[1:20:25] in onions, and she died because of it.
[1:20:27] Not everyone was craving that. Not
[1:20:29] everyone is seeking uh the the same
[1:20:31] thing. But some of the people around
[1:20:33] David, they were content just to go to
[1:20:35] church and just to praise when they
[1:20:37] attended church. He was not totally
[1:20:39] content with that. I want the living
[1:20:41] God. I want something deeper. There's
[1:20:44] nothing worse than going to church or
[1:20:46] being in the message and living a
[1:20:48] dissatisfied
[1:20:50] family life
[1:20:53] or a dissatisfied life. David sought for
[1:20:56] something deeper. He thirsted for
[1:20:58] something more than just what happened
[1:21:00] at church, something beyond church.
[1:21:03] I enjoy
[1:21:05] what the pastor is saying and I get a
[1:21:07] lot out of that and I drink from it. I
[1:21:08] trust you are tonight. But the quality
[1:21:11] of the church does not stop at just
[1:21:14] being in church together.
[1:21:17] When there's a deep calling, there's a
[1:21:18] deep to respond. Praise the Lord. Now I
[1:21:21] see the time now. I have to skip some of
[1:21:23] this.
[1:21:25] Well, let's quickly go to Proverbs
[1:21:27] chapter 5 if you would. I'm aware of the
[1:21:30] time.
[1:21:40] Boy, I got a whole thing here just on
[1:21:42] the mind and how it works, but we'll
[1:21:44] just try to find a place to wrap this up
[1:21:47] this evening. Proverbs chapter five,
[1:21:55] my son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow
[1:21:58] thine ear to my understanding, that thou
[1:22:02] mayest regard discretion,
[1:22:04] and that thy lips may keep knowledge. So
[1:22:07] he's encouraging a man or a young man in
[1:22:11] this case to get understanding.
[1:22:14] Understanding is the opposite of being
[1:22:16] ignorant
[1:22:18] because he's going to explain now
[1:22:22] something that can happen in ignorance.
[1:22:24] Somebody who without who's without
[1:22:27] understanding particularly of the
[1:22:29] strange woman. So he says that thou
[1:22:32] mayest regard discretion that lips may
[1:22:34] be keep knowledge for the lips of a
[1:22:36] strange woman drop as a honeycomb and
[1:22:39] her mouth is smoother than oil but her
[1:22:42] end is bitter as wormwood sharp as a
[1:22:44] two-edged sword. So, so, so now in in
[1:22:49] relation to men now, and I won't I won't
[1:22:51] be too graphic here. The I'll just be as
[1:22:54] graphic as the scripture would be, but
[1:22:56] it's interesting that as he talks about
[1:22:59] a young man, he must get understanding.
[1:23:02] He must get revelation.
[1:23:04] God said in one place in one of the
[1:23:06] minor prophets, he said, "My people are
[1:23:08] destroyed for lack of knowledge."
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Why? Because Satan takes advantage of
[1:23:14] it.
[1:23:16] And so it's an interesting that in
[1:23:19] relation to a subject on getting
[1:23:22] understanding for a young man, he goes
[1:23:24] right to probably one of men's greatest
[1:23:27] temptations. And that that's this
[1:23:30] strange woman. And the way her outward
[1:23:32] is is her the lips drop as a honeycomb
[1:23:36] and her mouth is smoother than oil. Um
[1:23:39] there's an attraction going on here on
[1:23:41] the outside, but here is the end. and
[1:23:43] her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as
[1:23:45] a two-edged sword. Her feet go down to
[1:23:47] death, her steps take hold on hell. Lest
[1:23:51] thou shouldest ponder the path of life,
[1:23:53] her ways are movable, that thou canst
[1:23:55] not know them. Hear me now, therefore,
[1:23:57] oh my children, and depart not from the
[1:23:59] words of my mouth. Remove thy way far
[1:24:02] from her. Who? The strange woman. I
[1:24:05] always tell young men, older men, the
[1:24:07] strange woman is any other woman beside
[1:24:09] your wife. Right?
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; And that doesn't matter. It's just any
[1:24:15] other woman than your wife. Bo, I'm not
[1:24:17] married yet. Well, you have a wife
[1:24:19] somewhere.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; So, you still have to stay away from the
[1:24:22] strange woman because you have a wife
[1:24:24] somewhere.
[1:24:28] Remove thy way from her, and come not
[1:24:30] nigh the door of her house, lest thou
[1:24:32] give thy honor unto others, and thy
[1:24:33] years unto the cruel. This all the
[1:24:35] fruits come that comes from you falling
[1:24:38] to that. Lest strangers be filled with
[1:24:40] thy wealth and thy labors be in the
[1:24:42] house of strangers. You see so many
[1:24:44] times man keeps falling into sexual
[1:24:46] temptation. They may have been very
[1:24:48] rich. More than likely they lose all of
[1:24:50] that. It goes to someone else because
[1:24:52] this type of sin affects your entire
[1:24:54] life, affects your family, affects your
[1:24:57] finances. God can't bless any of it. And
[1:25:01] thou mourn at the last when thy flesh
[1:25:03] and thy body are consumed and say, "How
[1:25:05] have I aided instruction and my heart
[1:25:07] despised reproof?" and have not obeyed
[1:25:09] the voice of my teachers, nor inclined
[1:25:11] my ear to them that instructed me. I was
[1:25:15] almost in an evil in the midst of the
[1:25:17] congregation and assembly. Very
[1:25:19] interesting scripture. You can underline
[1:25:20] in verse 14. I was almost in all evil,
[1:25:24] but I was in the midst of the
[1:25:26] congregation and assembly. Wow.
[1:25:30] Wow. Can Satan suddenly entice somebody
[1:25:33] privately where they're right around the
[1:25:35] congregation and yet evil has set in?
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; So just catch this now. He's warning the
[1:25:45] young man right away to a woman because
[1:25:48] there's nothing that would appeal to him
[1:25:50] more. Women are tempted in different
[1:25:52] ways, but men, this is what he talks
[1:25:54] about. And there's probably many other
[1:25:56] temptations for a man, but he's going to
[1:25:58] talk about the strange woman. And then
[1:26:00] he's going to say this, verse 15, drink
[1:26:02] waters out of thine own sistn, and
[1:26:05] running waters out of thine own well.
[1:26:07] Let thy fountains, which is your
[1:26:09] offspring, be dispersed abroad, and
[1:26:12] rivers of water in the streets. Let them
[1:26:14] be only thine own. Let and and not
[1:26:17] strangers with thee. Let thy fountain be
[1:26:20] blessed, and rejoice with the wife of
[1:26:23] thy youth. Let her be as the loving hind
[1:26:26] and pleasant ro. Let her breast satisfy
[1:26:28] thee at all times, and be thou ravished
[1:26:32] always with her love. Do you know what
[1:26:36] he just did? You know what he just said?
[1:26:41] He said, "You have a thirst."
[1:26:45] And he warns against the wrong fountain.
[1:26:48] And he says, "I will provide you with a
[1:26:52] fountain to drink from
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; and it'll be pure. It'll be holy.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Be ravished with her love for the rest
[1:27:02] of your life. Because why? I have given
[1:27:04] her to you that you enjoy her
[1:27:07] fellowship, her companionship. One
[1:27:11] fountain to drink from. I teach the
[1:27:13] young men, the older men. You live. I'm
[1:27:16] a onewoman man
[1:27:19] for life.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; And women,
[1:27:24] I'm a one-man woman.
[1:27:26] You have to say that and generate I'm a
[1:27:28] you know
[1:27:29] the the sisters have a bent towards if
[1:27:33] he provides the right things for her and
[1:27:35] provides love and affection for her she
[1:27:37] usually will gravitate but in this
[1:27:38] generation there's so many temptations
[1:27:41] you need the resolve Lord make me a
[1:27:43] oneman woman there's only one person God
[1:27:47] has for you to life in life to pour out
[1:27:50] all of your affections emotionally
[1:27:54] physically belong longs to be poured out
[1:27:57] on one person. Hope the young people are
[1:27:59] listening. You don't dabble in a bunch
[1:28:01] of relationships and everything before
[1:28:03] you're married. No, you hold yourself
[1:28:05] for one person in life. That's right.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Men, it's a onewoman man. It all every
[1:28:12] bit of it, all attention, all flirting
[1:28:16] goes to one woman.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Boy,
[1:28:21] we sure need more of that teaching in
[1:28:22] the earth we live in.
[1:28:25] That's what he's teaching. And he's he's
[1:28:27] saying, "I've got to end. I know it's
[1:28:29] 8:30, but you know what he's saying?
[1:28:32] He's saying," don't be ignorant.
[1:28:35] Seek my understanding. And here's one of
[1:28:38] the things I understanding. You're going
[1:28:39] to have thirst. And the reason that you
[1:28:42] might be attracted to the strange woman
[1:28:44] is because you have a thirst.
[1:28:47] And the strange woman is put there for
[1:28:49] you to take your thirst and drink from
[1:28:52] her with a pure thirst. Then it's not
[1:28:56] pure anymore.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; But now he says, "Guess what? I'm
[1:29:01] providing you fountains.
[1:29:03] I'll give you a wife. I'll give you
[1:29:05] children. And they will be fountains.
[1:29:08] You'll drink from your children
[1:29:10] satisfaction and joy." Now, when my kids
[1:29:14] were young, some of them, I won't
[1:29:16] mention some of their names, but there
[1:29:18] was some tough times where I didn't
[1:29:19] really see them as this beautiful
[1:29:22] fountains to drink from with joy and
[1:29:24] happiness.
[1:29:27] They didn't look like fountains many
[1:29:29] times. And then I submit myself to the
[1:29:32] scripture and I see it more now. I wish
[1:29:33] I'd have seen it more back then. Now I
[1:29:35] see it more. My greatest satisfaction
[1:29:39] is to spend time with my sons and
[1:29:42] fellowship, my daughters.
[1:29:44] And and guess what? It should be that
[1:29:47] way from the beginning,
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; But we get off track. We get distracted.
[1:29:51] We get bitter. We get sin in our lives.
[1:29:54] And that's why that's why
[1:29:57] that is why
[1:29:59] the woman at the well, I'll end on her.
[1:30:05] The woman, where did Jesus meet her? At
[1:30:08] the well.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; But the whole story isn't about her
[1:30:12] having her daily thing to duty to go get
[1:30:15] water and bring it back into the
[1:30:16] village. No, no, no, no. She had a
[1:30:19] thirst when she was a young girl.
[1:30:22] And brother Brandham said her parents
[1:30:24] put her out and set her in the wrong
[1:30:27] direction. Wasn't even fair.
[1:30:32] But she had a pure thirst. And then she
[1:30:34] was taught
[1:30:37] the wrong kind of love. She was c taught
[1:30:41] the wrong kind of love. And she's trying
[1:30:43] to meet this thirst going from man to
[1:30:45] man to man. And all it is is she's
[1:30:47] trying to meet a thirst that was within
[1:30:48] her. And she was taught this must be the
[1:30:50] way of satisfaction. But she wasn't
[1:30:52] satisfied because she's had five. And
[1:30:55] she's now she's got another one thinking
[1:30:57] about marrying him. Why is she going
[1:31:00] from man to man? because she's trying to
[1:31:01] meet a thirst she never got fulfilled in
[1:31:03] Christ.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; It's all about thirst. And standing
[1:31:08] there with Christ himself, the son of
[1:31:12] man, guess what? Where was he going to
[1:31:14] go to? Oh, he talks about her problem,
[1:31:16] but no, he had something greater to give
[1:31:18] her. He was going to be the fountain
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; that she would finally drink from and
[1:31:23] find out, I'm not a prostitute. I'm not
[1:31:26] this identity. Because that's what
[1:31:27] happens in our minds when we do certain
[1:31:29] things and fulfill certain things. We
[1:31:31] start to take on the identity of that
[1:31:34] and believe the lie that we're that
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Jesus was able to take her back and show
[1:31:40] her who she really was and that before
[1:31:42] all that her thirst was pure
[1:31:47] and his power of his washing of his
[1:31:49] fountain as she drank from it could take
[1:31:51] her back to getting the right thing for
[1:31:54] that thirst.
[1:31:56] When she began to drink from it, guess
[1:31:58] what? Guess what? Everything else got
[1:32:01] washed away.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Just completely washed away. All the
[1:32:06] thinking about herself, all the lies,
[1:32:08] all the misperceptions. You talk about a
[1:32:11] washing, it completely cleansed her of
[1:32:14] all her former ideas of what she was.
[1:32:17] I'm preaching to you that fountain's
[1:32:19] available to you tonight. that fountain
[1:32:22] in Zachchariah.
[1:32:24] In that day, there'll be a fountain
[1:32:27] opened in the house of David.
[1:32:31] Let's stand together.
[1:32:46] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:32:54] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:32:57] We just take this moment, Lord, to speak
[1:33:00] to you from our hearts, Lord, from the
[1:33:03] depths of our heart.
[1:33:05] Lord, sometimes
[1:33:07] you show us things like this to show us
[1:33:09] that we can always seek for more of God
[1:33:12] in something even deeper in our lives.
[1:33:16] Lord, when you reach out to a life,
[1:33:18] there's no psychologist, there's no
[1:33:22] thing of this world, there's nothing
[1:33:23] that can go as deep as you can go. And
[1:33:27] that's why we trust in you, Lord. That's
[1:33:29] why we love you because when you go
[1:33:31] there, we know it's it's it's for our
[1:33:34] good, oh Jesus, bring us to a repentance
[1:33:38] tonight, Lord. Bring us to a dependence
[1:33:41] on you. Bring us to a trust in you, Lord
[1:33:44] Jesus. God bring us to a place that we
[1:33:47] would examine and look at our lives and
[1:33:50] that we would gain the understanding
[1:33:52] that Satan might understand
[1:33:55] who we are as far as the flesh man
[1:33:59] better than we understand ourselves.
[1:34:02] And we become a a target
[1:34:05] for this enemy. I don't want to give him
[1:34:07] too many compliments because he'll never
[1:34:09] be greater than than you, Lord.
[1:34:12] But he's certainly been masterful at
[1:34:15] trying to misguide people to the wrong
[1:34:18] place to drink from.
[1:34:22] Draw us closer to you, Lord. I pray
[1:34:25] forgive us, Lord. God, raise us up as
[1:34:29] sons and daughters of God, young or old,
[1:34:34] that would begin to draw so much from
[1:34:36] your fountain that there would be a
[1:34:38] contentment and satisfaction and
[1:34:40] happiness set in to the people of God
[1:34:43] like never before.
[1:34:46] That the hurts and the pains and the
[1:34:48] fears and the hesitation and that all of
[1:34:52] it could be washed away just as the
[1:34:55] woman at the well. Lord, we find as we
[1:34:58] quench our thirst at that place, we find
[1:35:01] Lord that we experience the abundant
[1:35:05] life and the fullness of joy that you
[1:35:08] purchased for us at Calvary. Forgive us,
[1:35:11] Lord. Cleanse us, Lord.
[1:35:18] Let us drink from the living fountains
[1:35:20] of God. Let us drink from the domestic
[1:35:22] fountains you've given us to drink from.
[1:35:27] Teach us Lord not to look to other
[1:35:30] places
[1:35:32] filling a void within us.
[1:35:36] Teach us Lord.
[1:35:39] Guide us Lord we pray.
[1:35:42] I'm asking for you to pray tonight
[1:35:44] before we sing. I'm asking you to speak
[1:35:46] to the Lord this moment, this time that
[1:35:50] you open your heart to him.
[1:35:56] Guide me, Lord, that I would only drink
[1:35:58] from the fountains that you've provided
[1:36:00] for me for my life.
[1:36:04] Lord, let me leave all those other
[1:36:06] things.
[1:36:10] When a Isaac began his journey, we see
[1:36:13] Lord that he found a bunch of wells and
[1:36:15] the enemy had filled all those wells.
[1:36:18] Abraham had dug them. They were great
[1:36:20] wells. They were beautiful wells.
[1:36:23] And the enemy had filled them all in
[1:36:25] with dirt, garbage.
[1:36:28] Isaac found them all.
[1:36:31] had his men dig them all out, refresh
[1:36:33] them, bring them back again, dig all the
[1:36:35] mud out so he could utilize all the
[1:36:38] wells that you have given to Father
[1:36:41] Abraham.
[1:36:43] Lord, maybe tonight we need to dig out
[1:36:45] some of the dirt and find what's
[1:36:48] smothered over the joy that we could
[1:36:50] have in Christ. Grant it, Father,
[1:36:53] tonight that you'd work more deeply in
[1:36:56] our lives, Lord, that we'd find joys
[1:36:59] that we never dreamed of finding before.
[1:37:02] Grant it, Lord. I don't want to smear on
[1:37:03] the message.
[1:37:06] I don't want to be a pretender.
[1:37:09] I want to be real.
[1:37:11] I want to be satisfied.
[1:37:14] I want to walk with you, Lord. And maybe
[1:37:17] we would love our wives and our husbands
[1:37:19] and our children and our brothers and
[1:37:21] sisters just a bit deeper tonight.
