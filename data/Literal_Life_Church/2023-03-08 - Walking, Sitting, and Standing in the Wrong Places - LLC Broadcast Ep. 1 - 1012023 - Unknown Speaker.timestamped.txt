[6:32] Godly nor standeth in the way of Sinners
[6:36] nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful
[6:39] but his Delight is in the law of the
[6:41] Lord and in his law doth he meditate day
[6:44] and night and he shall be like a tree
[6:46] planted by the rivers of water that
[6:48] bringeth forth his fruit in his season
[6:51] his Leaf also shall not wither and
[6:54] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper I'd
[6:57] like to read verse 1 again but because
[6:59] that's probably what I'll mostly get to
[7:01] tonight blessed is the man that walketh
[7:04] not in the counsel of the ungodly nor
[7:07] standeth in the way of Sinners nor
[7:09] sitteth in the seat of the scornful so I
[7:13] I just want to speak a little bit
[7:15] tonight about walking sitting and
[7:18] standing in the wrong places
[7:20] walking and sitting and standing in the
[7:24] wrong places you don't want to be
[7:25] standing or sitting or walking in the
[7:28] wrong places but you want to be
[7:30] positioned in your position in the times
[7:32] we're living in now walking and sitting
[7:35] and standing in the wrong places and I'm
[7:38] going to make this just as simple as
[7:39] possible tonight
[7:41] and uh and go back into this a little
[7:43] bit and I'm just rehearsing a little bit
[7:45] from Sunday but we'll just elaborate a
[7:48] little bit more because uh Sunday we
[7:50] talked about out of perfect Faith the
[7:52] believer's position and what perfect
[7:54] faith is and how we get into that Jesus
[7:57] was in perfect Faith because he knew who
[7:59] he was he had the confidence not human
[8:01] confidence but a real confidence in his
[8:04] position and who he was in God and what
[8:07] he was there to do what his purpose was
[8:08] on Earth and when we begin to have a
[8:11] revelation of that that it creates
[8:12] confidence and Faith love was another
[8:14] thing love works in coordination with
[8:16] faith and when we know how much God
[8:19] loves us truly loves us then our love
[8:22] reaches back to him and our love for one
[8:24] another and this creates this atmosphere
[8:26] of perfect faith and Reliance and
[8:29] confidence that we're not so susceptible
[8:32] to all the fears of this world and the
[8:34] anxiety that's of this world you're not
[8:36] a sinner because you have anxiety today
[8:38] but we have to be reminded there is a
[8:41] resting place for our souls our minds
[8:44] our Spirits we have a resting place
[8:46] tonight and if we'll learn as a
[8:49] Christian how to move ourselves out of
[8:51] the nervousness of the world and into
[8:54] that position of perfect faith and try
[8:56] to even learn to stay in there every day
[8:58] how many raise your hand I'd like to
[8:59] stay in there all every hour that's all
[9:01] of our challenge but we have so many
[9:03] things to try to pull us out of it but
[9:05] we've got to learn that nobody else is
[9:07] interested in this except Believers no
[9:10] the message didn't come to everybody but
[9:12] except to Believers that perfect faith
[9:14] is for believers nobody else wants that
[9:17] kind of life but we want it and so now
[9:19] we have to learn and be and move into an
[9:22] adoption maturity that we recognize the
[9:25] devil in every one of his tricks we
[9:27] recognize the fear of the world we
[9:28] recognize what triggers us what makes us
[9:31] upset what makes us unhappy what draws
[9:35] us down as soon as we begin to notice it
[9:37] we can quickly change our thoughts and
[9:39] say no no we're not going there I'm
[9:41] staying right here in this at realm of
[9:43] perfect Faith amen and so this is
[9:46] something we learn it doesn't happen
[9:47] overnight I don't believe that a
[9:49] Believer I believe a Believer has
[9:51] everything he needs when he gets the
[9:53] Holy Ghost to be able to overcome but I
[9:55] don't believe he knows how to overcome
[9:57] overnight
[9:58] I believe we learned this I'm I'm 55
[10:01] years old and I've been serving the lord
[10:03] for 30 something years and I'll tell you
[10:06] I'm still learning every day I read my
[10:08] devotional the last three or four days
[10:10] that I gave as a gift and we had and
[10:12] I'll tell you I'm inspired by the word
[10:14] of God it encourages me can you say amen
[10:17] and I learn things every day from him so
[10:19] I'm like a child when it comes to the
[10:21] word and I just think I'm thankful that
[10:24] we can be teachable can you say Amen
[10:26] we're growing into a life of perfect
[10:28] faith and so now why is this man in
[10:31] Psalms 1 why is he so blessed and and
[10:34] favored by God because he said blessed
[10:37] is the man he's blessed he's favored
[10:40] he's thriving and he's prospering
[10:42] because it ends saying because he's
[10:44] planted in the right place everything he
[10:46] touches prospers everything he does
[10:48] prosper and so why why is these this way
[10:51] the the simplest answer is he's living
[10:54] this way because it is where he has
[10:57] positioned himself self
[11:00] because it says he plants himself
[11:02] besides the rivers of water so it's all
[11:06] about positioning it's all about where
[11:08] you plant yourself spiritually I know
[11:11] where you're planted tonight uh
[11:13] physically some of you are here in uh
[11:16] Petersburg some are in your homes
[11:18] somewhere on the couch uh I'm having to
[11:21] stand tonight you're on your couch but
[11:23] anyway I know where you're planted
[11:25] tonight every in every other place but
[11:27] I'm talking about spiritually where are
[11:30] you planted because where your position
[11:32] and how your thought life is and how you
[11:34] think every day that's the position that
[11:37] shows whether you're going to live a
[11:39] thriving spiritual life
[11:41] and we have to stay there we have to
[11:43] work we have to walk in that place and
[11:45] so it's where this man positions himself
[11:47] and it's in that world of perfect faith
[11:50] that Jesus talked about I read it on
[11:52] Sunday that Jesus lived in it he lived
[11:55] in a realm of perfect Faith uh the Devil
[11:58] Couldn't get to him there and it's a
[12:00] place that it was a world to himself
[12:03] that nobody else knew anything about and
[12:05] incidentally how many knows that Jesus
[12:08] said that where I am they may be also
[12:10] everywhere that Jesus goes he's bringing
[12:13] the rest of the brother and Brethren
[12:14] with him
[12:15] he's the firstborn among many brother
[12:19] he says he's leading many into victory
[12:22] in other words it's not just Jesus that
[12:24] goes there but wherever Jesus goes he's
[12:27] bringing every son and daughter of God
[12:29] with him and if he lived in perfect
[12:32] Faith now it's time for us to live in
[12:34] perfect Faith it's not that we're not
[12:35] going to be physically sick it's not
[12:37] that we're going to have not gonna have
[12:39] trials we're not going to get sicknesses
[12:41] cancers uh deaths all these things to
[12:44] deal with can't promise that whatsoever
[12:46] but I can promise you from the word of
[12:48] God he gave us an escape he gave us a
[12:51] promise he gave us a place to live that
[12:54] perfect Faith Can Master every
[12:57] circumstances and he can give you things
[13:00] that you know that you can control
[13:03] because there are things you can't
[13:05] control
[13:06] but I can tell you there are things the
[13:08] believer controls through the faith of
[13:10] God
[13:11] amen I told someone the other day you
[13:14] you know you can't you can't control
[13:16] what happens on the outside but you can
[13:19] control your thought life there's a lot
[13:22] of people who's giving up
[13:23] if thoughts are bombarding me and so I
[13:25] have no control no no you do have
[13:27] control
[13:28] the Bible talks about it you have
[13:30] control to redirect your thought life so
[13:32] you ought to take that as a victory
[13:34] tonight to say Satan can only go so far
[13:36] because there's a domain of my thought
[13:39] life that I can be in control by the
[13:41] Holy Spirit I can redirect my thoughts
[13:45] and he wants us to do that so he lived
[13:47] in a realm perfect a perfect Faith
[13:49] perfect Faith Masters every circumstance
[13:51] and so it's about your spiritual
[13:53] position it's it and when it uses the
[13:56] words the man that walketh not in the
[13:59] Council of the ungodies standeth in the
[14:01] way of Sinner sinneth all these words
[14:03] sinneth standeth walketh are all about
[14:06] position
[14:08] I know that's real that's as simple as
[14:10] dirt
[14:11] sitting standing walking is all about
[14:15] position
[14:16] and we think of it physically but he's
[14:18] speaking about a spiritual all these
[14:20] positions that we're in and place
[14:23] ourselves and expose ourselves to it can
[14:25] be the right thing or it can be the
[14:27] wrong thing and this this brother as an
[14:30] example this Godly blessed man is chosen
[14:33] to position himself not in these
[14:35] positions of standing and and sitting
[14:38] amongst the scornful or standing and
[14:40] watching The Way of the Sinners or or
[14:43] walking with the Council of the ungodly
[14:45] he distanced himself from that he
[14:48] intentionally positions himself
[14:49] spiritually that he's not going to be
[14:51] under those influences
[14:53] every one of you can do that
[14:56] every one of you can position yourself
[14:58] away from those things and so swalking
[15:01] standing sitting that's what I want to
[15:03] speak on walking sitting and standing in
[15:05] the wrong places I want to elaborate on
[15:08] it tonight because this is real this is
[15:10] the place sometimes that we get where we
[15:13] don't realize spiritually people don't
[15:15] know where they're at but if they stand
[15:16] back and look and they can they can see
[15:18] they've positioned themselves too close
[15:20] to a wrong relationship too close to
[15:24] feeding on something that's not right
[15:25] that can be from something very evil on
[15:28] the internet to always somebody hanging
[15:30] around a Jonah
[15:33] you can position you cannot be involved
[15:36] in Internet dirtiness but you can be
[15:38] always buddy and buddy with a Jonah A
[15:41] backslidden or a person that's running
[15:43] away from the Lord and you're staying
[15:45] close to them maybe you're trying to
[15:46] help them but you're staying so close
[15:47] that they're actually bringing you down
[15:50] and the guys on the boat with Jonah
[15:52] eventually realize hey bud get off of my
[15:55] vote when they realized and Jonah
[15:58] realized why the storm was happening and
[16:00] why all these incidents which is listen
[16:02] bud we're giving you a kick whatever God
[16:05] wants to do with you but get off of my
[16:07] boat because you're causing storms in my
[16:09] life
[16:11] be loving be kind be gentle but don't
[16:15] let a Jonah continue to be so close to
[16:17] you that it keeps bringing you down so
[16:20] now if this position this place this uh
[16:24] positioning that he places a Christian
[16:26] is is away from these things you you
[16:29] need to kick a Joan off your boat
[16:31] because he's he's in a sometimes they're
[16:34] not backstudding but they're in a place
[16:36] of running from God
[16:38] so you're talking to him maybe you're
[16:39] trying to help him give a word of
[16:40] encouragement but if you got yourself
[16:42] positioned close enough to them it may
[16:44] influence you
[16:47] so it's all about positioning yourself
[16:49] and so we're going to get into that a
[16:50] little bit more tonight that that uh
[16:52] when you were talking about walking
[16:54] standing sitting that about covers it
[16:55] wherever we are spiritually and none of
[16:58] those are in the Council of the ungodly
[17:01] he chooses I'm not going to be around
[17:03] the Council of the ungodly around the
[17:05] path of Sinners or in the sea of
[17:07] scornful so the first thing in his mind
[17:09] is not to be open to just any influence
[17:13] that's around too many Believers
[17:15] position themselves too vulnerable and
[17:18] too influenced by many many voices and
[17:21] then wonder why they have no faith
[17:24] and then wonder what's going on in my
[17:26] life why why do I feel so defeated there
[17:29] doesn't seem to be enough Victory and
[17:31] they if they're not looking at the
[17:32] voices they're listening to they're not
[17:34] looking at where they're positioned
[17:35] they're not willing to pull away from
[17:37] something maybe
[17:40] they're not willing to cut maybe cut off
[17:42] some influences in their life they're
[17:44] not willing to do it and so now there's
[17:46] the defeat there's the thing that places
[17:48] you you can't live where you need to
[17:49] live there might need to be some real
[17:51] prayer to say Lord what is it that I'm
[17:54] positioning my life too close to in
[17:56] order that's keeping me weakened that I
[17:58] couldn't be the full potential of what I
[18:00] should be so the first thing he says is
[18:02] that this man walketh not in the counsel
[18:05] of the ungodly so to break this down
[18:07] this brother this sister has given a
[18:10] deaf ear to hear the advice and counsel
[18:13] of anyone ungodly
[18:17] he has chosen to give a deaf ear to
[18:20] advice or should I say screening the
[18:23] advice and counsel of everybody because
[18:26] everybody some most people have good
[18:29] intentions but not all counsel will do
[18:31] your life good
[18:33] and so this brother this sister is
[18:35] saying I'm not I don't want to listen to
[18:38] the counsel of the ungodly uh he's not
[18:41] going to follow the advice their advice
[18:43] or their example and you should know
[18:46] friends that in our world you can
[18:49] receive counsel and counseling with not
[18:52] even going to pay and sit on a couch
[18:55] with a counselor
[18:58] in our world and in our environment
[19:01] I don't know if Paul would have had to
[19:03] spoke about this as much as I do in his
[19:06] day or even back in Luther's day but in
[19:09] our day people are receiving counsel and
[19:12] advice and guidance all the time but
[19:15] most of it's not good
[19:17] so you have to sit down on a couch at a
[19:19] psychologist and and pay him 300 bucks
[19:22] an hour to get counseling every day
[19:25] you're getting guidance and counseling
[19:28] by what we read by the news we're being
[19:31] guided a certain way can you say Amen
[19:34] that the news intentionally guides a
[19:37] certain way
[19:38] and so now everybody else may swallow
[19:41] that everybody else may say you know I'm
[19:44] fine with that but but not us because
[19:45] listen now we had a screen the council
[19:48] that we get we got to watch the council
[19:50] that we get we got to know the source
[19:51] that it comes from and and we got to
[19:53] know what we trust can you say amen and
[19:56] you can get counsel of what to do and
[19:58] you didn't even ask for that counsel but
[20:00] you're getting counseled
[20:03] some people go and find the counselor
[20:06] that they want to find
[20:10] they only pick the people that's going
[20:12] to agree with them
[20:14] or they're only going to go visit places
[20:16] they can feel better about the guilt
[20:18] that they feel so they're going to hang
[20:19] around and get the advice of ones that's
[20:22] going to tell them what they want to do
[20:24] I don't think that's wisdom can you say
[20:26] Amen so now you can you you can get
[20:29] counsel of what to do and you didn't
[20:31] even ask for it sometimes and you can
[20:33] sit right in your home with your phone
[20:36] and receive all kinds of influence
[20:38] within just minutes counsel is counsel
[20:43] is advice given whether formal or
[20:45] informal so it can be a formal counsel
[20:48] somebody's telling you I'm going to give
[20:49] you some advice or it can just be
[20:51] informal and that means you can receive
[20:53] counsel but it it wouldn't be the right
[20:55] Council it can mean guidance it can mean
[20:58] Direction so you can get guidance by
[21:01] many things in this life and we must
[21:03] screen and we must be holy ghost filled
[21:06] to say I do not want I want to make sure
[21:08] that I'm not receiving the counsel of
[21:10] the ungodly we have to be prayerful we
[21:12] have to be praying we have to be guided
[21:14] by the word and the Holy Ghost in our
[21:17] lives or we will swing certain ways and
[21:20] not even realize that we're taking the
[21:22] counsel of the world
[21:23] or the Council of the ungodly just
[21:26] because it sounds right doesn't mean
[21:28] it's always right he gave me a hiding
[21:31] place to live in he gave me a hiding
[21:33] place he gave me an atonement and that
[21:36] atonement was good from Calvary all the
[21:38] way to 2022. if I get sick if I'm gonna
[21:42] die I have an atonement to go to my God
[21:44] I have healing in the blood of the Lamb
[21:48] let's not forget that though God heals
[21:50] through medicine God heals through
[21:52] different things God uses vaccines and
[21:54] all these other things let's not forget
[21:57] our atonement that God has for us we are
[22:00] believers
[22:02] we are Christians can you say Amen this
[22:05] word is our absolute
[22:07] this is what we should be clinging to
[22:09] this is what we salute Lord where's my
[22:11] guidance in the word of God you as with
[22:13] the Holy Ghost can be influenced by the
[22:15] wrong spirit
[22:16] amen
[22:17] you could ever end a spirit of anger or
[22:20] something you act out of place and you
[22:22] got to make that right right away can
[22:23] you say amen and you're going what's in
[22:25] here well strong Spirit came in the home
[22:27] between you and your wife or whatever
[22:28] and so you may have all the holy ghost
[22:30] in the world but sometimes you got to
[22:32] repent and say God I see that's the
[22:34] wrong Spirit that's working in me a
[22:37] Believer should not be living on Google
[22:39] for information for the decisions they
[22:41] make all the time not following the
[22:43] dating habits of the worldly shows said
[22:46] that Sunday
[22:47] don't live on the advice of people who
[22:49] have left the message and form their own
[22:51] life with what they want of the Bible
[22:53] don't don't be under the vice of people
[22:55] like that the fruits show that that's
[22:57] not headed in the right direction so
[22:59] you're not taking scriptures and advice
[23:00] from them they're teaching the
[23:02] scriptures but but watch where their
[23:04] life is going
[23:05] so that's the Council of someone that
[23:08] has not got the pattern of a life can
[23:10] you say amen and so now if this is some
[23:13] of the influences in your life you will
[23:15] never grow to more faith this uh blessed
[23:19] believer in Psalms 1 is not influenced
[23:22] by those things he don't walk in the
[23:24] Council of the ungodly he's not planted
[23:27] near the Council of the ungodly he's not
[23:29] opening his Spirit to just anything
[23:31] being said can you say Amen
[23:34] we better make sure the council mostly
[23:37] comes
[23:38] if not all from the Lord
[23:41] and a holy ghost-filled person don't
[23:43] underestimate someone that you know has
[23:45] the Holy Ghost to get advice from them
[23:49] don't underestimate what God can speak
[23:52] through them to help you
[23:54] and I'd rather go to a person maybe a
[23:56] little sister in the church sister yeah
[23:59] a sister she's got the Holy Ghost like a
[24:01] brother
[24:03] and your young sister should go to the
[24:05] sisters that show that they have the
[24:06] Holy Spirit in their life and ask advice
[24:08] we don't do that a lot today young
[24:10] people don't ask for advice from the
[24:12] older ones but I'm not just saying the
[24:14] older ones they have some wisdom but I'm
[24:16] saying I know this person has the holy
[24:18] spirit in their life they've proved it
[24:20] for years
[24:21] so I can trust I'd rather listen to what
[24:24] they have to say been through it been
[24:27] there done that been through their
[24:28] trials and there's that consistent life
[24:30] now just living for the Lord I ought to
[24:32] have my ears open to somebody like that
[24:34] instead of some Google or some scallywag
[24:37] or someone that's left the message I
[24:40] ought to be clinging to a holy ghost
[24:41] believer the next thing he does is that
[24:43] okay now that's the first part is that
[24:45] don't he doesn't
[24:46] he doesn't walk with walk with Council
[24:49] of the ungodly now he doesn't
[24:52] stand in the path of Sinners that's an
[24:55] obvious thing that we shouldn't stand in
[24:57] the path of sinners
[24:58] but standing in the path of them doesn't
[25:00] mean you're going down their path it
[25:02] means you're you're standing in the path
[25:03] watching them in the path they're going
[25:05] down
[25:07] you're around them you're watching what
[25:08] they're doing you're standing in the
[25:10] path not necessarily following them
[25:13] but just standing and watching what they
[25:16] do all day
[25:19] you're feeding on what they do and maybe
[25:22] how exciting their life is oh I would
[25:24] never do some of the things that they're
[25:25] doing but it's just fun just to get on
[25:28] and watch them in the path that they're
[25:31] on
[25:32] so you're going to stand on the path of
[25:34] somebody oh I'm not on the path I'm not
[25:36] heading that direction I'm a message
[25:37] believer but you stand all day on the
[25:39] internet and you're standing there
[25:41] watching the path that they're going
[25:43] down this believer says listen I'm not
[25:46] going to stand and position myself
[25:47] watching the path they're going on I
[25:50] could be watching something else so it's
[25:53] all day feeding on what they do and how
[25:55] exciting their life is how many know the
[25:57] Sciences if you sit there all day and
[25:59] listen to that stuff somebody else's
[26:01] life is everybody's life is more
[26:02] exciting than yours their vacations are
[26:04] better than yours your life is a
[26:06] miserable failure you're nothing you're
[26:09] sitting there in your little
[26:09] three-bedroom house and you'll never
[26:11] reach up to where they're at
[26:13] you'll never make a cobbler as good as
[26:16] that person on the internet
[26:19] that's what the whole thing is about and
[26:21] now that's where depression comes from
[26:22] I'll never look like them I'll never
[26:25] have the beauty of them I'll never this
[26:27] is what our world has become Christians
[26:29] should not be taking their cues and
[26:31] watching the way and the path of Sinners
[26:34] are going down we've got a word to look
[26:36] at can you say man we've got the glory
[26:39] of Christ Among Us
[26:41] God's doing things
[26:43] and we can be looking at something else
[26:45] besides the path they're going down and
[26:47] we can we've got another path because
[26:49] the Bible says that we can walk in the
[26:52] path in the light of the word Thy word
[26:54] is a lamp unto my feet
[26:56] and a light unto my path
[27:00] that's the path I want to be on and so
[27:01] this is I'm going to elaborate sitting
[27:03] around people who complain being around
[27:05] people who are critical being on the
[27:07] internet with somebody who's constantly
[27:08] critical
[27:09] somebody who mops all the time somebody
[27:11] is moping all the time now you might try
[27:14] to encourage a person like that and and
[27:16] that's great if you can do that I find
[27:19] with people it's hard to pull them out
[27:20] of that stuff and so you can give all
[27:23] your efforts to it but if they keep
[27:24] staying in there they're moping then you
[27:27] just say I'm gonna pray for you they got
[27:28] to encourage you you got to be careful
[27:30] how much you hang around moping critical
[27:32] people trying to find the fault in
[27:34] everything all the time
[27:36] because we're we're to call to be
[27:38] positive
[27:40] we're called to give a positive word
[27:42] we're called to talk about our victories
[27:45] not our defeats can you say amen and I
[27:47] don't mean be phony like we don't have
[27:49] defeats we do but but when David was
[27:52] called before Goliath or Goliath and all
[27:54] the children of Israel and saw when he
[27:56] got up in front of them and he gave his
[27:58] testimony he told of his victories with
[28:02] the bear and with the lion he didn't
[28:04] share his defeats he shared his
[28:06] victories
