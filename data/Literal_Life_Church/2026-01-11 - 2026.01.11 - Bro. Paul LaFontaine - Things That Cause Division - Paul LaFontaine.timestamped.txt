[31:03] Oh, how
[31:06] he loves me.
[31:09] Oh, how
[31:11] he loves you and me.
[31:18] Reach your hand and say, "Thank you,
[31:19] Lord. Thank you, Lord." Thank you, Lord.
[31:23] Hallelujah.
[31:25] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Bless you, Jesus.
[31:29] Amen. Everybody said, "Amen."
[31:32] &gt;&gt; From the depths of our hearts. Praise
[31:34] the Lord. Thank you girls for that
[31:35] special and leading us into that worship
[31:38] and those thoughts of God that uh are
[31:41] the most amazing thing is how much he
[31:43] has loved us.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; Uh even when we've been unlovable and
[31:47] even when we didn't even know him, he
[31:49] was loving us. He loved us before the
[31:51] foundation of the world.
[31:53] &gt;&gt; We appreciate him this morning. God
[31:55] bless you all in Christian love. It just
[31:57] feels real good to be in the house of
[31:59] the Lord. Feels good to be someplace
[32:00] warm, but the warmness of the the fires
[32:04] of God, we just appreciate it. I love
[32:06] going to church. I love the fellowship
[32:08] of the word. I don't have to preach. I
[32:10] just want to be in his presence.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; I just want to be wherever he is.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; And I appreciate him so much this
[32:15] morning. It's been a very um busy and
[32:18] eventful week for us as a family. And um
[32:21] the baby and mom are doing well. And I
[32:24] know I've watched it this week as I was
[32:26] there Monday to Friday. The only reason
[32:27] I'm I've come home is because everything
[32:29] just leveled out with uh with little
[32:32] Letty there, our granddaughter, and also
[32:34] my daughter. And uh just I watched I
[32:37] watched your prayers in action and the
[32:39] prayers of the saints around the world.
[32:41] And I want to say how much I appreciate
[32:42] it watching that firsthand because it
[32:44] could have went a lot of different
[32:46] directions. It could have been extended
[32:47] their condition. And uh they're both
[32:50] doing very well this morning. And uh I
[32:52] thank the Lord for it. She's going to
[32:53] be, I believe, a healthy little girl.
[32:56] And uh so we appreciate you lifting us
[32:58] up this week and uh just being that uh
[33:01] strength that we needed, you know,
[33:03] during this time. We felt your prayers
[33:06] and uh so it's just, you know, it's kind
[33:08] of funny. I don't know if any of you set
[33:10] your New Year's resolutions. Some of
[33:11] mine were to have a more disciplined
[33:14] schedule.
[33:17] And I wrote it all out and planned it
[33:19] all out. This day I'm going to do this.
[33:21] And the whole week is completely
[33:24] changed. And isn't that about right
[33:26] about life? You know, we try to set
[33:28] things, but God has his his
[33:30] interruptions sometimes that he's going
[33:32] to get glory out of things and we need
[33:34] to always be sensitive to him
[33:37] interrupting our schedules because he
[33:39] might want us to do something for him.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; And uh so it's his plan and it's his his
[33:44] calendar that I'm more want to be
[33:47] submissive to than our own calendars.
[33:49] Praise the Lord. God bless you this
[33:51] morning. Let's turn in our Bibles if you
[33:53] would to Proverbs chapter 6. We're going
[33:56] to read a couple places this morning.
[33:57] And I uh I'll do just a little switching
[34:01] to what maybe we're used to. Just be a
[34:03] little bit more pastoral this morning
[34:05] and do it might be end up being some
[34:07] instruction. I want to talk about things
[34:08] that cause division and uh hopefully
[34:11] it'll be a blessing to everybody, but uh
[34:13] sometimes we just get in this mode a
[34:15] little bit. Want to give some
[34:16] instruction and pastor away. Uh
[34:18] sometimes a pastor will get into these
[34:20] things where others ministries wouldn't.
[34:22] And so just maybe to uh give some good
[34:27] teaching in this area and things that
[34:29] cause division sometimes that we don't
[34:31] recognize that would cause division. And
[34:34] there's one thing about division. We
[34:36] know the author of the one who wants to
[34:39] divide the body of Christ. And that's
[34:41] not necessarily you or I. It's the devil
[34:44] &gt;&gt; because he hates oneness. the fair the
[34:47] Pharisees picked up stones against uh
[34:49] Christ when he said I and my father are
[34:51] one. So as the bride is coming into not
[34:54] just a revelation of it, she's actually
[34:55] becoming one with the bridegroom. That's
[34:58] what's happening. Uh you can imagine the
[35:01] enemy is fighting your life much more
[35:03] and also fighting because the oneness
[35:06] and the unity is not just with Christ
[35:08] but it's with one another.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; And that's an amazing miracle because uh
[35:13] you all got different mindsets. You have
[35:15] different backgrounds. You have
[35:17] different opinions. And uh so to bring
[35:20] that together and to find humility and
[35:24] find a way to bring us as one because
[35:26] Jesus not only prayed that he and the
[35:28] father was one but the bride would be
[35:30] one with him and they would be one with
[35:32] one another. That's quite a tall order
[35:35] &gt;&gt; especially when you got opinions and uh
[35:38] some opinions like yours. It's a
[35:39] difficult task. It would be a miracle.
[35:42] And uh but you know I I want to help
[35:45] this morning and be to look at these
[35:48] things a little closer because it's not
[35:49] just that he dividing from the enemy is
[35:53] what the denominational spirit is.
[35:56] Brother Brand when he referred to
[35:58] denominationalism there sometimes he
[35:59] talked about dividing and separating the
[36:02] body of Christ. So he he's about
[36:04] conquering and dividing. So he's about
[36:06] dividing us. And so that's when we have
[36:09] a spirit of divide. It's denominational
[36:13] whether it's under the guise of the
[36:15] message or not. It's the it's the
[36:17] enemy's work.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; Uh so we don't want to be
[36:21] denominational, right?
[36:23] &gt;&gt; We don't want to we if we see those
[36:25] traits, that's what we've come out of.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; So we're looking for something greater
[36:29] in our lives.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; So we want to just try to maybe not fix
[36:33] things. It was so funny yesterday uh
[36:35] coming through uh Seattle
[36:38] going to the airport. I seen this
[36:40] plumbing truck. It says Universal
[36:42] Plumbing and the slogan was uh we're we
[36:45] are to uh we are to repair what your
[36:47] husband fixed.
[36:51] I got a kick out of that one. I thought
[36:54] that's good. Well, I'm not here to fix
[36:56] anything here this morning, but um I
[36:58] just want to be used of the Lord to look
[37:00] at this subject a little bit. Don't know
[37:02] if we'll finish everything, but um we'll
[37:04] just look at it. Proverbs chapter 6. And
[37:06] we'll use this as a foundation starting
[37:08] at verse 12. A naughty person, a wicked
[37:11] man, walketh with a froward m forward
[37:14] mouth.
[37:15] He winkketh with his eyes. He speaketh
[37:18] with his feet.
[37:20] He teacheth with his fingers.
[37:23] Forwardness is in his heart. He devisth
[37:25] mischief continually. He sweth discord.
[37:28] Therefore shall his calamity come
[37:30] suddenly, suddenly shall he be broken
[37:33] without remedy. These six things doth
[37:36] the Lord hate. Yay, seven are an
[37:38] abomination unto him. So here's seven
[37:42] things that are uh uh things that the
[37:44] Lord hates and also uh abominations. So
[37:48] this is really should perk our ears up.
[37:51] We're often read from things in the new
[37:53] the Old Testament in the law that are
[37:55] abominations to God. And things that are
[37:57] abomination don't really change. God
[37:59] doesn't change. If if it was an
[38:01] abomination back then, then it's still
[38:03] an abomination today. Why? Because God
[38:06] doesn't change. In the Old Testament
[38:08] law, there's so many of them. And some
[38:10] are dietary laws and things that we
[38:11] don't use today, but there are some
[38:13] things that don't change. The Ten
[38:14] Commandments don't change.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[38:17] &gt;&gt; And uh there are abominations. A woman
[38:19] shouldn't wear that which pertainth to a
[38:21] man, even pertains to a man. You never
[38:23] want to leave a hint that when you walk
[38:25] out, sisters, you walk out, then you
[38:27] leave even a hint that you're masculine.
[38:29] God's not made you masculine.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; So that that is still true today. So,
[38:34] but these are strange things that God
[38:36] hates because we can jump onto the Old
[38:38] Testament law, but these are different
[38:40] things that we would expect that God
[38:42] hates. A proud look, a lying tongue,
[38:47] hands that shed innocent blood, a heart
[38:50] that deviseth wicked imaginations,
[38:53] feet that be swift in running to
[38:55] mischief, a false witness that speaketh
[38:59] lies, and he that sweth discord or
[39:03] divide among the brethren. Now, when we
[39:06] look and say, see, God's going to
[39:08] express what he really, really hates
[39:10] here, then we're thinking maybe we're
[39:13] thinking a dress code or we're thinking
[39:15] outward things or we're thinking of
[39:17] church order. Uh, but these are the
[39:20] things that God hates as well. And
[39:21] probably we should pay attention to this
[39:24] because we don't want to be under a
[39:26] spirit that would be manifesting these
[39:28] things
[39:29] &gt;&gt; because God hates them. I got a feeling
[39:32] that the reason he hates this so much is
[39:35] because he's a god who's trying to bring
[39:37] oneness with his people to himself and
[39:41] also oneness amongst themselves. And so
[39:43] he would hate anything that tries to
[39:46] kill that oneness.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; And remember what I preach, I I say this
[39:50] to young people a lot as well. Whatever
[39:53] God hates, we want to hate it too,
[39:56] &gt;&gt; right? We want so much Holy Ghost that
[40:00] whatever God whatever smells God bad to
[40:03] God, we want it to be the same with us.
[40:06] That's the way we want to live. I want
[40:07] to read one more place in 1 Corinthians
[40:09] 1 just so that we don't say this. This
[40:12] principle is only true in the Old
[40:14] Testament. Well, then we get to the new
[40:16] church, one of the message churches
[40:19] here, the Corinthian church. All the
[40:21] Ephesians and Galatians and Corinthians,
[40:24] all the little churches were little
[40:26] message churches that rose as a result
[40:27] of the ministry of the son of man.
[40:30] 1 Corinthians chapter 1
[40:34] and the Corinthian uh local church was
[40:36] an interesting one.
[40:39] So, but he says to the fir in the first
[40:41] chapter of uh 1 Corinthians, he says to
[40:45] them verse 10, I beseech you, brethren,
[40:48] by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[40:49] that ye all speak the same thing, and
[40:53] that there be no divisions among you,
[40:56] but that ye perfectly be joined together
[40:59] in the same mind, and in the same
[41:02] judgment. For it hath been declared unto
[41:05] me of you, my brethren, by them which
[41:08] are of the house of Khloe, that there
[41:11] are contentions among you. This is not a
[41:17] Jewish church. This is not a church that
[41:21] believes another God. This is the church
[41:23] of the living God. This is a this is
[41:26] believers who have the Holy Ghost. and
[41:29] he's going to be honest with his uh
[41:31] prophet eye and say, "I've heard this,
[41:34] but I also see this that there's
[41:35] contentions and divisions among you.
[41:38] This shouldn't be so.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; This shouldn't be so." Um, just before
[41:42] we pray, I was I was it was interesting
[41:45] to see he ends second Corinthians, where
[41:48] is it here? I didn't plan to read this,
[41:49] but he ends on the same subject. 2
[41:52] Corinthians 13
[41:55] verse 11. He ends the both chap both
[41:58] books saying the same thing.
[42:06] Verse 11. Finally, brethren, farewell,
[42:09] be perfect, be of good comfort, be of
[42:12] one mind, live in peace, and the God of
[42:16] love and peace shall be with you. So he
[42:19] starts it with saying the goal is to be
[42:21] of one mind. And he ends it. So that
[42:24] must be the theme of all the things he
[42:25] says in the to the Corinthians. We have
[42:28] to allow the Holy Ghost to bring us into
[42:30] one mind, one accord and to to dissolve
[42:34] the divisions among us. Heavenly Father,
[42:36] we ask for your help today. And Lord, I
[42:39] just want to pause and say thank you for
[42:42] the restoration of my granddaughter and
[42:44] my daughter. Lord could have went a
[42:46] different direction, Lord. You but you
[42:48] heard the prayers and cries of the
[42:49] people in our family. And I'm thankful
[42:52] this morning they're healthy and they're
[42:53] moving along. And I just pray you'll be
[42:55] with them. And my wife who's there with
[42:57] them. Lord, I just pray you give them
[42:58] strength. It's been a a weary week for
[43:00] us. But Lord, you have you have restored
[43:03] us and you have answered back to us and
[43:05] we're thankful. We love you so much.
[43:07] Certainly love these people who have
[43:09] showed their hunger for the word to
[43:11] gather here this morning. I love them,
[43:13] Lord. I uh I see their love for you,
[43:18] their love to worship you. And Lord,
[43:20] that's a challenge for me to stay close
[43:23] to you that I could feed them, Lord,
[43:25] your word. Thank you, Father. Thank you
[43:28] for your love.
[43:31] You have loved us more than any other
[43:33] love we've ever known. And I pray you'll
[43:36] bless the word this morning in Jesus
[43:38] name. Amen.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Forgive me.
[43:46] I just wanted to read the meaning to
[43:48] that forward man. Not forward but
[43:50] forward. It's not a familiar word that
[43:53] we use but it is mentioned other places
[43:55] in the Bible. A forward man. And there's
[43:59] not it's it's it's nothing good about
[44:01] this kind of man. Forwardness is the
[44:04] quality of being stubbornly contrary,
[44:06] disobedient, uncooperative,
[44:09] characterized by a reluctance to yield
[44:11] or comply. often involving perverseness,
[44:15] uh, peevishness and a rebellious or
[44:18] rebellious or difficult to manage
[44:20] attitude with roots in old English
[44:22] meaning turned away from what is right
[44:24] or expected. It's an archaic word
[44:26] frequently used in the Bible to describe
[44:28] a heart or a mouth inclined towards
[44:31] evil, deceit, and sowing discord. So,
[44:33] it's not just his heart, it's what comes
[44:35] out of his mouth. It's towards evil,
[44:38] deceit, and sowing discord rather than
[44:41] following righteous paths. His actions
[44:43] are tied to devising mischief or sowing
[44:47] discord or division. And so you look at
[44:50] these some of there's many scriptures
[44:51] about it, but you look at these other
[44:53] scriptures if you guys don't pull mind
[44:55] pulling them up quickly. Proverbs 4:24,
[44:58] it's uh this describes a man. It's in
[45:00] his heart. Mischief is in his heart, but
[45:02] then it comes out of his mouth. So, it's
[45:05] a big mouth problem.
[45:07] It's an uncontrolled mouth. It's a mouth
[45:10] that gives itself permission to say
[45:12] anything it wants to say at any time. It
[45:14] doesn't matter what damage it does. This
[45:18] is a man who does not have the Holy
[45:19] Spirit in control of his mouth. Now, I
[45:22] know that the Lord has if you have the
[45:24] Holy Ghost, he has control of your soul
[45:26] and lives with the control of your soul.
[45:29] But that's not all the further we go in
[45:30] this message. The word has taken us even
[45:33] the prophet mentioned he said to be
[45:34] transformed by the renewing of the mind.
[45:36] Brother Bham says now that you've been
[45:38] saved now that you've been baptized now
[45:40] that you been filled with the Holy
[45:42] Ghost. Now he said we let the word
[45:44] transform our minds and change our
[45:47] thinking that we can grow beyond just
[45:49] having the Holy Ghost. That one place he
[45:52] says the Holy Ghost begins to grow out
[45:54] and pushes out and it all of a sudden
[45:57] grabs your mouth. It grabs your eyes
[45:59] that you don't look at the wrong things.
[46:01] It grabs your heart. It It just takes
[46:03] control. And uh but Proverbs 4:24 says
[46:06] about his mouth, "Put away from thee a
[46:09] forward mouth and perverse lips put far
[46:11] from thee." Proverbs 8:13. I don't know
[46:14] how quick you guys can pull those up.
[46:15] Proverbs 8:13, "The fear of the Lord is
[46:18] to hate evil, pride, and arrogancy, and
[46:21] the evil way, and the forward mouth do I
[46:24] hate." Proverbs 10:31.
[46:28] The mouth of the just bringeth forth
[46:30] wisdom, but the forward tongue shall be
[46:32] cut out.
[46:35] Proverbs 10:32,
[46:38] "The lips of the righteous know what is
[46:40] acceptable, but the mouth of the wicked
[46:42] speaketh forwardness." And the last one,
[46:44] Proverbs 16:28. Proverbs 16:28, "A
[46:48] forward man seweth strife, and a
[46:51] whisperer separateth chief friends."
[46:56] This is how powerful this is. Is that it
[46:59] actually takes close close friends,
[47:03] close unions, and actually uses its
[47:06] tongue to separate the closest friends.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; That's the enemy.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; That's the devil.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; The spirit that takes this person and
[47:16] gives them permission, I don't want to
[47:17] spend a lot of time on the forward man,
[47:19] but you should study it. The spirit that
[47:21] takes this person and gives them
[47:23] permission to spill anything out of
[47:25] their mouth at any time seeks to divide.
[47:28] Sometimes a person has this on them and
[47:30] doesn't even realize it and has not
[47:32] learned that what they're saying is
[47:34] dividing people. What they're saying is
[47:36] is is is hurting the church. What's
[47:38] coming out of their mouth? How many
[47:40] remember the children of Israel when
[47:42] they were murmuring in their tents?
[47:44] Nobody could see it between except those
[47:46] that were murmuring the mom and dad and
[47:48] the children. They couldn't hear it.
[47:49] They thought they were hiding it, but
[47:51] God heard the murmuring in the tents and
[47:53] he went through Moses and said, "There's
[47:54] murmuring going on.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; There's things being said that shouldn't
[47:58] be said. This is dividing the people.
[48:01] THIS IS DISRESPECT TOWARDS THIS PROPHET,
[48:04] TOWARDS THE PILLAR OF FIRE, TOWARDS the
[48:05] leadership of the Lord, towards the
[48:07] unity of the the children of Israel."
[48:10] And God identified it. And so now the
[48:12] closest friends can be divided by this
[48:15] spirit. And and we watch how we we've
[48:18] seen this firsthand as a pastor watch it
[48:21] come into the youth group. Watch it come
[48:23] into the church and people that were
[48:25] closest friends in the youth group,
[48:27] people that were closest friends in the
[48:29] church or it could even be in a
[48:31] business. They're not as close anymore.
[48:33] Something divided them. And when you
[48:34] step back as a pastor and you look and
[48:36] you watch someone take that spirit, it's
[48:39] out to divide even the close. It
[48:41] actually resents close friendships. And
[48:43] so they're going to say things, did you
[48:44] know this about person? Did you know
[48:46] this about it? And so underhandedly,
[48:48] they're taking the closest friends and
[48:51] dividing those friends up.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; So moving along, here's my take on the
[48:59] verses 17 and 18. Now, if you if you
[49:01] still have it there, if you still have
[49:03] it open to Proverbs 6, 17, 18, 19, the
[49:06] six the seven things that God hates. I'm
[49:09] moving along now because I I want to
[49:11] preserve the time. But in 17 and 1819,
[49:14] this is kind of my this is uh this is
[49:18] breaking kind of se uh seven seven seals
[49:22] here on the things that God hates. Um
[49:25] you never hear much on the you hear a
[49:27] lot about the seven seals but not so
[49:28] much about these seven things that God
[49:30] hates. Uh so this is the mystery behind
[49:32] the seven things. This is kind of the
[49:34] Lefontaine standard revised version of
[49:36] verse 17, 18, and 19. If you could read
[49:38] it together. Number one, pride makes him
[49:42] think he knows everything and is better
[49:44] than anyone. So his pride puts others
[49:47] down.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; That's just my amplified version.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Number two, he draws quick conclusions
[49:55] of people and things before the facts
[49:58] are in
[49:59] &gt;&gt; and he goes ahead and tells the lies
[50:01] whether he's found out the truth or not.
[50:03] The next one is he finds dirt on people
[50:06] who have not done anything wrong. They
[50:08] are innocent. But he finds dirt and he
[50:10] brings up dirt on people.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; If he hasn't heard anything, he can
[50:15] concoct his own lies in his imagination
[50:20] and tell those things and say those
[50:22] things not based upon truth but based
[50:24] upon his own imagination.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Next one. If he sees something that
[50:29] causes
[50:31] or creates mischief or he sees something
[50:33] that's damaging or talk that's going on
[50:36] or some type of mischief is damage or
[50:39] playful trouble. They they don't say,
[50:41] "Well, we're just doing it out of joking
[50:43] around." It's playful trouble. They're
[50:45] making mischief. They're doing, you
[50:47] know, kids that get into mischief and
[50:49] they're just playing around, but it can
[50:50] be dangerous. It can be dam damaging
[50:52] sometimes. And so this person sees
[50:55] others doing this and he doesn't run
[50:57] away from it. He runs towards it
[51:01] &gt;&gt; because he loves to find mischief. He
[51:03] loves to find something like that. And
[51:05] so he he does it he he runs towards it
[51:08] instead of away. He joins in with it. He
[51:11] don't run away from gossip or or correct
[51:14] the gossip going on. And I just wanted
[51:16] to say to you here that that we have
[51:19] taught these things for years and we
[51:21] believe that we have learned how
[51:23] damaging gossip really is.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; When you've been through things as a
[51:27] church, then you teach that the the less
[51:29] that you can say that's not edifying,
[51:32] the better. In other words, train your
[51:34] mouth. Say, "Lord, let my mouth watch
[51:37] it. Watch my tongue, especially when I'm
[51:40] home. You can talk real nice here, but
[51:42] it especially when I'm with my family or
[51:45] with someone else or another believer in
[51:47] the church to watch my tongue because we
[51:50] have learned in this congregation how
[51:53] damaging the tongue can be and how bad
[51:56] gossip can be.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; The prophet preached a sermon one time
[52:01] uh and he he said, "I finished that." He
[52:03] said, "I felt like I covered every
[52:06] exposed every sin a person could do.
[52:08] place was convicted, everything. And one
[52:10] sister come up in his church and said,
[52:12] "You didn't hit me today. Good message,
[52:14] but you didn't hit me." She runs off and
[52:16] and he said, "Well, that's good. I'm
[52:17] glad you're living so close that, you
[52:19] know, it didn't hit you." And the
[52:20] brother comes. Do you know her? Do you
[52:22] know she's the worst gossip in the
[52:24] church? You forgot to hit gossiping.
[52:28] She got by that Sunday anyway.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; And this morning, I'm not here to
[52:34] personally correct anybody. I'm I'm here
[52:36] to bring the word of God and I'm here to
[52:39] grow sons and daughters of God to
[52:40] adoption.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen?
[52:43] &gt;&gt; That's where we're at. And so growing to
[52:45] adoption isn't just that we understand
[52:48] the mysteries and the seven seals. That
[52:51] can tend to bring without character that
[52:53] can tend to bring an arrogancy to it.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; That can TEND TO BRING PRIDE to it. So
[52:58] when the rubber meets the road, we want
[53:00] to let the character grow in many areas
[53:02] of our life. as Paul says in Ephesians
[53:05] to grow up into him in all things.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Come on now. That's Bible. To grow up
[53:12] into him in all things. And so you can't
[53:14] be spiritually mature and emotionally
[53:17] immature.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Your emotions and your spirit must be
[53:24] under God's leadership as well.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; So if we're talking about adoption, it's
[53:29] not just growing spiritually and in the
[53:31] word. It's growing emotionally that your
[53:34] emotions and your life and your mouth is
[53:36] lined up with the maturity of where the
[53:39] word is taking you.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, if this is a
[53:43] service that doesn't hit anything in
[53:44] your life, then God bless you. Stick
[53:47] around.
[53:49] The Lord has your number.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; So, did I finish him? No. He So, he he
[53:56] runs towards the gossip. We don't
[53:58] believe in gossip around here. I just
[53:59] wanted to say it. We don't believe in
[54:01] it. We don't believe in running our
[54:02] tongue. I don't know what church that
[54:03] you come from 10 years ago or what you
[54:06] grew up in, but we want to set the
[54:07] record that whether it's me or you, we
[54:10] want to be careful what we say because
[54:12] it can be damaging because the the the
[54:15] enemy can use it even though if you
[54:18] think it's innocent, it can be used to
[54:20] be damaging. So, we we want to just set
[54:22] that this morning and I trust you take
[54:24] it in in in a good spirit. So, now we we
[54:27] don't we we run away from it. I think
[54:28] it's good if you hear gossip going on. I
[54:30] think you should good be good to
[54:32] politely correct that. And we've had
[54:34] people leave sometimes because they were
[54:36] used to an environment of gossiping and
[54:38] they get corrected by someone here and
[54:40] it's just like they they quickly leave
[54:42] because you either make a choice. You
[54:44] can grow in the Lord into maturity and
[54:46] character or you can keep things the way
[54:48] that you had them.
[54:51] But I think we should correct it
[54:52] sometimes and change the conversation
[54:54] and certainly not don't run towards
[54:56] those types of houses of gossip but run
[54:59] away from those things. So he runs it he
[55:01] actually joins the club of mischief. He
[55:03] joins it. He didn't run from it. And
[55:05] then he he also he's not an eyewitness.
[55:07] I uh excuse me. Uh yeah this is he's not
[55:10] an eyewitness to something but steps
[55:13] into the witness stand and tells the
[55:15] lies anyway. That was number six. So he
[55:18] hasn't seen it. He doesn't know it. He's
[55:21] not an eyewitness, but he makes himself
[55:23] a witness in a court case and puts
[55:26] himself on the stand and tells the lies
[55:28] anyway. And the last one is he sews
[55:32] discord among the brethren. He plants
[55:35] little seed thoughts by his words in
[55:38] other people's minds against other
[55:41] people. He sws the seeds of divide to
[55:45] divide the body of Christ or to divide a
[55:48] marriage or to divide a home.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Discord means Kenny, I want you to come
[55:54] up here a minute if you would.
[55:57] Discord means number one, disagreement
[55:59] between people. And second, I was really
[56:03] surprised to see this and I'll let Kenny
[56:05] on the fly see if he can give me a a
[56:09] visual or something here. The second
[56:11] meaning to discord is is a lack of
[56:15] harmony between notes sounding together.
[56:18] If you don't know music, you have the
[56:20] the melody part of the song, which we
[56:22] all sing usually the melody, but the
[56:24] harmony is what makes it so nice because
[56:26] there's there's harmonizing notes that
[56:28] go with it to make it more beautiful.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; So, we want to have harmony in the body
[56:34] of Christ, right? So, but in order to
[56:36] have really good harmony, you have to
[56:38] make sure those harmonic notes. Uh, and
[56:42] you could ask Kenny at depth about this.
[56:43] He'd know this. My sister Sharon would
[56:45] know these things. In order to have
[56:47] that, you've got to have those harmony
[56:48] notes because there's a lot of notes on
[56:50] that piano. But you have to bring that
[56:52] note in the harmony with that melody
[56:55] line. And if it's not in that, then we
[56:58] realize we're going to recognize right
[56:59] away it's not in harmony. We're not in
[57:00] harmony. Something's wrong because
[57:02] somebody is playing the wrong note.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Even people that are not musically
[57:10] inclined.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; And I won't mention names here.
[57:18] You should be able to recognize this.
[57:20] And I'm going to ask brother Kenny to
[57:21] play Amazing Grace if you would. If you
[57:23] haven't prepared something yet uh in the
[57:26] last 10 seconds,
[57:28] I want you to play me amazing great
[57:30] beautifully with all the harmonies that
[57:31] play Amazing Grace just as nice as you
[57:33] can play it.
[57:35] [Music]
[57:50] Okay, now just play the melody line
[57:52] without the harmony.
[57:58] [Music]
[58:03] Okay, so that's pretty,
[58:08] but I like harmony. I like to sing with
[58:11] my siblings like I last did last Sunday.
[58:13] I don't like to sing by myself because
[58:14] the melo it's it's it's good, but then
[58:17] add in the harmonies with that and play
[58:18] it again. It's just prettier.
[58:22] [Music]
[58:24] That's a big difference. That's a That's
[58:26] a church that's playing in harmony
[58:29] &gt;&gt; with the great conductor
[58:31] &gt;&gt; according to the sheet music.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; And I was at a I I I went to the Toledo
[58:37] Symphony a couple years ago and
[58:39] everything Brother Brandham preached
[58:40] just come alive because you see that
[58:42] everybody had to be so disciplined. You
[58:45] couldn't play your own music.
[58:48] Everybody had to be disciplined to play
[58:50] to the music that was in front of them.
[58:52] And everyone had a different instrument
[58:54] with a different sound to it. Was
[58:57] trained different on the instrument. But
[58:59] when they come together as an orchestra,
[59:02] they had to be disciplined to not do
[59:04] their own thing, but to play according
[59:06] to the music of the director, the
[59:09] conductor or the one who wrote the
[59:11] music.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; And I couldn't believe the discipline.
[59:13] And I thought, my I know there's
[59:15] probably a lot of liberal people in
[59:16] there that do their own thing in a lot
[59:18] of ways, but I was amazed that they're
[59:20] disciplined to say we do it according to
[59:22] music. It was so disciplined and it was
[59:24] just and it was beautiful, beautiful
[59:26] music. It would have been chaos if
[59:28] somebody was doing their own thing.
[59:33] Now, if you can play it with getting
[59:35] some of those harmony notes off because
[59:37] it's not just that harmony is beautiful,
[59:39] but then the persons that playing the
[59:41] harmony parts with the melody has to be
[59:43] on note too and play the notes, right?
[59:46] Or it would sound like this.
[59:54] [Music]
[1:00:18] Woo. That's enough. That's enough.
[1:00:24] Thank you.
[1:00:27] We were cringing at all that. Some of
[1:00:28] you don't even know music and you're
[1:00:30] cringing at it. If he played that way
[1:00:32] every Sunday, we'd fire him.
[1:00:35] But that's a good piano player that can
[1:00:37] play good and he can play bad to give an
[1:00:38] example. Uh and by the way, I taught him
[1:00:41] everything I know. He grew up in my
[1:00:42] church and he's one of the best. One of
[1:00:45] the best. The Lord's blessed us. One of
[1:00:47] the best. And uh
[1:00:50] if I had just if I had just an afternoon
[1:00:53] with him, I could really show him some
[1:00:54] stuff. I'll tell you that.
[1:00:57] But I'm over here cringing and you're
[1:00:59] cringing because that ain't the way it's
[1:01:01] supposed to be.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; That ain't the way. And it's all because
[1:01:04] he just moved one little finger and some
[1:01:07] little finger got rebellious.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Just one of the fingers and all it got
[1:01:14] rebellious and played something that
[1:01:16] wasn't in harmony with the melody of the
[1:01:19] song.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; So when when it says divide is is that
[1:01:24] the harmony is not there. It's not. It
[1:01:26] says a lack of harmony between notes
[1:01:29] sounding together. The notes are
[1:01:31] supposed to sound together.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; And when someone gets off note, someone
[1:01:35] gets off key. I've told you about when I
[1:01:38] was a uh in junior high, I played with
[1:01:41] the orchestra and uh I played the tr uh
[1:01:44] the um the baritone or the tuba. And so
[1:01:49] uh me being a little bit have the ear
[1:01:51] for music, I was learning that. But just
[1:01:53] to make a long story short, when we all
[1:01:55] got our first first got our instruments
[1:01:57] and we played together uh in in front of
[1:02:00] Mr. Cunningham, it sounded it it was it
[1:02:04] was atrocious. It was terrible.
[1:02:08] And then as we went through the school
[1:02:10] year and we kept playing, it didn't get
[1:02:12] too much better. I mean, it was just the
[1:02:15] kids were learning how to play music and
[1:02:16] it was it was a little bit closer, but
[1:02:18] it just and I and so now we're coming up
[1:02:20] on the final season concert and I
[1:02:23] knowing music and I wouldn't sound that
[1:02:25] great either, but knowing music, I said,
[1:02:27] "Are we actually going to have a concert
[1:02:29] and play in front of our parents when we
[1:02:31] sound like this?" I wanted to ask Mr.
[1:02:32] Cunningham that. And I didn't, but I
[1:02:34] said, "This is going to be a disaster.
[1:02:36] This sounds bad."
[1:02:39] And what happened was is that the last
[1:02:44] day of the concert about two hours
[1:02:46] before we all came in and every person
[1:02:49] took their instrument into a private
[1:02:51] office with the director by ourselves
[1:02:54] and he had a little tuning machine and
[1:02:57] we blew that blew a note into that
[1:03:00] machine and he seen how much was off and
[1:03:02] he adjusted our valves, he adjusted
[1:03:04] this, he tuned the strings of the
[1:03:05] violin, he tuned the instrument up.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; The director alone personally
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; tuned each instrument.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; It wasn't a part of the master. But but
[1:03:22] when he tuned it individually in that
[1:03:24] secret place
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; when there was a little room
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; that you individually tuned the
[1:03:33] instrument, then we come out and
[1:03:35] everybody was tuned. And when we got out
[1:03:36] there that night, it actually was
[1:03:39] beautiful music because each instrument
[1:03:42] had been tuned.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; And I learned so much as a boy that
[1:03:48] listen now. It's not just that you have
[1:03:50] an orchestra. It's not just that you
[1:03:52] have the sheet music and the message.
[1:03:54] We've got the sheet music.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; We've got the director. Can you say
[1:03:58] amen?
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; We've we've got all the things that we
[1:04:01] need. But if you have all of that and
[1:04:03] you don't go home and get with Christ
[1:04:06] and have him tune up your life,
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; we're not going to have harmony in this
[1:04:11] church.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; You're not going to have harmony in your
[1:04:13] home.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; You're not going to have harmony in your
[1:04:16] marriage because you have to be
[1:04:17] teachable, correctable, and to let God
[1:04:20] to just move those little vows. I I felt
[1:04:23] like saying to Mr. Scrum, why didn't you
[1:04:24] do this at the beginning of the year?
[1:04:26] Please. But maybe it was to teach us a
[1:04:29] lesson that you not only have to be a
[1:04:32] part of I'm in the orchestra, I'm in the
[1:04:34] body of Christ, I'm in the bride,
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; but there is an individual tuning up
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; that God does to our lives.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; So all of these words in Proverbs 6, God
[1:04:51] hates all of these words and these
[1:04:52] actions. Why? Because he hates divide in
[1:04:55] his people. It's the opposite of what he
[1:04:58] desires. That we will all be of the same
[1:05:00] mind through perfect love. That's his
[1:05:02] desire. And this is a miracle that Satan
[1:05:04] fights against. This is a miracle that
[1:05:06] Satan hates. This is what he comes
[1:05:07] against as oneness. Even more is when a
[1:05:10] people with all different opinions and
[1:05:13] backgrounds and personalities and being
[1:05:15] emotionally damaged by our past
[1:05:19] to make all of that submissive to a
[1:05:21] greater thing that God wants to create.
[1:05:23] That's a miracle in itself. AND GOD HAS
[1:05:26] ALREADY PROPHESIED THAT MIRACLE WILL
[1:05:28] TAKE PLACE THAT THAT GOD AND HIS PEOPLE
[1:05:32] WOULD BE ONE. They would BE ONE WITH
[1:05:34] CHRIST. There is a marriage at the end
[1:05:36] time. There is an indivisible union with
[1:05:38] Christ. Can you say amen? And it will
[1:05:40] bring that atmosphere of divine PERFECT
[1:05:43] LOVE AND THE BRIDE WILL BE functioning
[1:05:46] only by the motive of divine perfect
[1:05:49] love. That's right.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; So something is working in our in our
[1:05:54] under our message that's greater than
[1:05:56] gifts.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; And he taught the Corinthians this
[1:06:01] because they were so gift bent.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; The gifts were all there. Praise the
[1:06:07] Lord. But Paul in 1 Corinthians 13 and
[1:06:10] ma basically the whole uh a whole
[1:06:12] chapter of Corinthians, he's trying to
[1:06:14] teach them there's something that wants
[1:06:16] to work among us greater than our gifts,
[1:06:18] greater than the pastor's gifts, greater
[1:06:20] than the musical gifts.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; What if God takes your gift away? In
[1:06:25] other words, why what if you can't do it
[1:06:26] anymore? Who are you then in Christ?
[1:06:28] That's right.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; So maturity is growing beyond lifting up
[1:06:35] the gifts and he wants to do something
[1:06:37] greater than our gifts. Our identity is
[1:06:39] NOT RELATED TO JUST OUR GIFT.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said BY THIS SHALL ALL MEN
[1:06:48] KNOW
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; that you are my disciples by your love
[1:06:52] one for another.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; So that sounds real denomination. It is.
[1:06:56] It's what it's what Christ the word
[1:06:58] said.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; By this thing, the whole world will look
[1:07:02] and say that's God's people.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of Christians on the face
[1:07:05] of the earth. There's a lot of churches.
[1:07:07] But when I meet this person and I get
[1:07:09] around them, that is God's people.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; And by this shall all men know that
[1:07:16] you're you are my people by your love
[1:07:19] one for another.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; I wanted to make this point before I go
[1:07:24] further with this this morning. is it's
[1:07:25] a point about division because there is
[1:07:27] a side to division that is correct. In
[1:07:30] other words, it's where Jesus said in
[1:07:32] Luke 12:51,
[1:07:34] suppose ye that I'm come to give peace
[1:07:36] on the earth, I tell you nay, but rather
[1:07:38] division. Now, this seems confusing if
[1:07:40] you don't understand it because the word
[1:07:43] actually brings separation. The word
[1:07:45] brings division. He said in John 7:43,
[1:07:48] so there was a division among the people
[1:07:51] because of him. So now we see then when
[1:07:54] the word comes it will cause a
[1:07:56] separation but the word will bring the
[1:07:59] separation not you.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; So there is a division that I'm not
[1:08:06] talking about this morning but I wanted
[1:08:07] to mention it to you because somebody
[1:08:08] might say well what about what Jesus
[1:08:10] said he didn't come to bring peace but a
[1:08:12] divide and separating from families.
[1:08:14] Abraham separated from his kindred in
[1:08:16] order to come to his inheritance. all
[1:08:18] these other things. There's a truth
[1:08:20] there, but it's the word that will bring
[1:08:22] that and not you intentionally bring it.
[1:08:24] You just live the word. You embrace the
[1:08:26] word. GOD WILL DO THE SEPARATING THAT HE
[1:08:28] HAS TO DO. BUT WHEN we intentionally do
[1:08:31] it, something's wrong. Now,
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; I realize you have there's there's
[1:08:34] things and the word will lead you to
[1:08:36] separate from the things of the world.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen? The word will, if you
[1:08:42] get IN THE WORD, CHRIST will lead you to
[1:08:44] separate from the things of the world,
[1:08:45] to separate from the wrong kind of
[1:08:48] associates, to separate from things that
[1:08:50] are weakening you, to separate from the
[1:08:53] wrong kinds of movies and the wrong
[1:08:55] kinds of uh uh uh uh WhatsApp and and
[1:08:59] social media, the word, IF YOU GET
[1:09:01] CLOSER to him, you're going to be
[1:09:03] separating from that stuff
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; and sometimes associates. So there is a
[1:09:09] division that happens, but it's the word
[1:09:10] that causes that. And then we have the
[1:09:12] scripture to not be unequally yolked
[1:09:15] together with unbelievers.
[1:09:18] This is a divide that's godly.
[1:09:21] God calls for it. But the devil is to
[1:09:24] divide God's own people internally.
[1:09:28] We know this. Satan is the author of
[1:09:30] this. Denominationalism divides the
[1:09:32] body. You say, "Well, I don't know. I I
[1:09:34] I I'm not talking about the people. I'm
[1:09:36] talking about denominational systems for
[1:09:39] 2,000 YEARS HAS NOT BROUGHT THE ONENESS
[1:09:42] of Christ. It's brought divide.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; It's brought pride.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; I know the way to life. Our denomination
[1:09:51] is the only way.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; So denomination divides. It's a spirit
[1:09:56] to divide us. If it doesn't do it on
[1:09:58] doctrine, which it tries to do, he will
[1:10:01] use other things. Satan, if he can't
[1:10:03] separate us on doctrine, he will use
[1:10:05] other things. He will use anything to
[1:10:08] divide us.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; I often read this funny little story to
[1:10:15] my staff or sometimes when ministers or
[1:10:17] pastors when I'm talking to them, and I
[1:10:19] know this seems a little strange, but it
[1:10:23] we must be aware that this is how the
[1:10:25] enemy can work. There was a church where
[1:10:27] the preacher and the song leader were
[1:10:29] not getting along.
[1:10:32] This began to spill over into the
[1:10:33] worship services. And one week, the
[1:10:35] preacher preached on commitment and how
[1:10:37] we should dedicate ourselves to the
[1:10:39] service. The song leader led a song that
[1:10:42] said, "I shall not be moved."
[1:10:46] The next Sunday, the preacher preached
[1:10:48] on giving and how we should gladly give
[1:10:50] to the work of the Lord. The song leader
[1:10:52] then led the song, "Jesus paid it all."
[1:10:55] There's a real tension going on here.
[1:10:57] Yeah.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; The next Sunday, the preacher PREACHED
[1:10:59] ON GOSSIPING AND HOW WE SHOULD WATCH OUR
[1:11:01] TONGUES. The song leader led a song, I
[1:11:03] love to tell the story.
[1:11:07] The preacher became very disgusted over
[1:11:09] the situation and the next Sunday he
[1:11:11] told the congregation he was considering
[1:11:13] resigning. The song leader led a song,
[1:11:16] "Oh, why not tonight?"
[1:11:20] And as it came to pass, the preacher did
[1:11:22] resign. And the next week informed the
[1:11:23] church that it was Jesus that led him
[1:11:26] there and it was Jesus that was taking
[1:11:28] him away. And the song leader then led
[1:11:31] the song, "What a friend we have in
[1:11:34] Jesus."
[1:11:37] People have a hard time laughing freely
[1:11:38] at that. I always get joy out of it
[1:11:41] because you know why?
[1:11:43] For 35, 40 years, I've watched how the
[1:11:46] enemy can divide even the leadership.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; And he uses sometimes very small things
[1:11:54] to do it. Sometimes it's big things,
[1:11:56] sometimes it's not. That's not the
[1:11:58] point. And sometimes God orders a
[1:11:59] separation in your life. But we need to
[1:12:02] be always submissive that the devil
[1:12:04] doesn't use us as a part of the problem.
[1:12:11] and the tension doesn't get to this
[1:12:13] place become so carnal. That's what uh
[1:12:16] Paul called the Corinthians, carnal.
[1:12:18] Their immaturity was carnal. We're not
[1:12:20] called to be carnal in our reactions.
[1:12:23] So, I want to move on to some things
[1:12:24] that cause division.
[1:12:27] I know this is very different this
[1:12:28] morning, but I trust it'll be a blessing
[1:12:30] to you. Let's move to the New Testament
[1:12:32] and some things out of Corinthians that
[1:12:34] we can see. Now, these are believers,
[1:12:36] the little churches now, and one of them
[1:12:38] is the Corinthian church. They're all
[1:12:40] different with many kinds of people,
[1:12:42] different people, different uh cultures,
[1:12:44] different backgrounds, different
[1:12:46] religious backgrounds. There were the
[1:12:48] Gentiles in the churches and then there
[1:12:50] was the Jews in the churches. And the
[1:12:52] Bible's pretty clear to show that often
[1:12:54] the tensions rose when the Jews wanted
[1:12:57] to hold on to something from their past
[1:12:59] church upbringing.
[1:13:01] And the Gentiles were scared of certain
[1:13:03] things, too, because they had worship,
[1:13:05] but it wasn't right worship. And so you
[1:13:08] bring all this together in a church and
[1:13:10] you realize if you don't understand how
[1:13:13] the enemy works, he'll use those things
[1:13:16] to cause divide.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; And so I'm going to name seven of them
[1:13:21] here that uh that I'm sure there's many
[1:13:24] more, but uh these are the things I'm
[1:13:26] bringing this morning. If you guys want
[1:13:28] to bring those seven things up, this is
[1:13:30] what I find as we're going to read
[1:13:31] through these things this morning. In
[1:13:33] other words, seven things that uh bring
[1:13:35] division to glory in men or to glory in
[1:13:38] flesh.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read it here in a minute.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; When we start gloring in men or gloring
[1:13:46] in their flesh, whether it be the
[1:13:48] prophet or a pastor or someone else, uh
[1:13:52] those that's something that causes
[1:13:54] division in the body. Number two,
[1:13:58] handling matters with immaturity
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; that causes division. Number three,
[1:14:03] intentionally
[1:14:05] to wound a weak conscience. This is in
[1:14:08] the Bible, to intentionally wound a weak
[1:14:10] conscience or a weak brother. It says
[1:14:13] though that those that are strong ought
[1:14:15] to bear the infirmities and the reproach
[1:14:17] of the weak.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; We don't put down the weak that are not
[1:14:20] strong in the Lord yet.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen?
[1:14:24] We do not belittle or put down someone
[1:14:26] who's not strong in the Lord yet. If
[1:14:28] we're really strong in the Lord
[1:14:30] ourselves, we are to bear the reproach
[1:14:32] and bear the bear that until they are
[1:14:35] strong.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; So, we're not too critical of somebody
[1:14:38] who's expressing some actions that we
[1:14:41] know are not right. We are not to
[1:14:43] belittle that, say, "Man, I'm not even
[1:14:45] sure you're part of the body of Christ
[1:14:47] the way you're acting. I know you don't
[1:14:48] have the Holy Ghost. I'm going to show
[1:14:50] you today." We're not to have that
[1:14:51] attitude. WE'RE NOT TO DECIDE WHO HAS
[1:14:54] THE HOLY Ghost and who doesn't.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; We don't have A RIGHT TO DECIDE WHO'S
[1:14:59] bride and who's not bride.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; To do that is immaturity.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; And so handling matters with immaturity.
[1:15:10] Number three, intentionally wound a weak
[1:15:13] conscience. Number four, selfish and
[1:15:15] self-centered. If we have that, it
[1:15:17] causes divine. Number five, living a
[1:15:19] different life at home than at church.
[1:15:23] Say, how in the world does that cause
[1:15:25] divide? Well, it did. Back in Joshua's
[1:15:28] day when somebody brought something in
[1:15:30] their home that wasn't right, it had an
[1:15:32] effect on the whole congregation.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; So, that's immaturity to say, "I have my
[1:15:36] own private life. I have what I want to
[1:15:38] have." But it can damage and bring
[1:15:40] divide in the body of Christ. Number
[1:15:43] six, being no number number five. And
[1:15:46] then number six, being unforgiving. An
[1:15:49] unforgiving spirit will cause divide.
[1:15:51] And number seven, raising personal
[1:15:54] preferences lifted too high.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Sometimes a personal preference of
[1:16:00] somebody becomes a religion.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; And sometimes they can have quotes to
[1:16:05] prove it.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; But if you fight for that thing and I
[1:16:09] want to make this a part, THIS NEEDS TO
[1:16:11] BE A PART AND I'VE GOT A QUOTE for it.
[1:16:12] There's something already wrong in your
[1:16:14] attitude.
[1:16:16] Can I get an amen this morning? You
[1:16:18] don't take your personal preferences,
[1:16:20] even if you feel like you've got strong
[1:16:22] things to endorse you. Be careful how
[1:16:24] you handle that and enforce it on
[1:16:27] everybody else.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Things that cause divide. If you get
[1:16:31] your Bible, we're turning to First
[1:16:32] Corinthians again and we're going to
[1:16:34] work through each of these things.
[1:16:35] That's what we're going to do.
[1:16:39] All right. 1 Corinthians,
[1:16:45] if you get real quiet, then I'm prepared
[1:16:47] for that. 1 Corinthians 1, after he says
[1:16:51] what we read in the text, 1:10, I
[1:16:53] beseech you, brethren, by the name of
[1:16:54] our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all
[1:16:56] speak the same thing, that there be no
[1:16:57] divisions among you, but that you be
[1:16:59] perfectly joined together in the same
[1:17:00] mind and the same judgment. For it have
[1:17:02] been declared unto me of you, my
[1:17:04] brethren, by them which are of the house
[1:17:06] of Khloe, that there are contentions
[1:17:07] among you. Now this I say that every one
[1:17:10] of you saith, I am of Paul, and I am of
[1:17:14] Apollos, and I am of Cphus, and I of
[1:17:17] Christ. Is Christ divided? Was Paul
[1:17:20] crucified for you? Or were you baptized
[1:17:23] in the name of Paul? I thank God that I
[1:17:25] baptized none of you, but Christmas and
[1:17:27] Gaes, other people baptized them.
[1:17:29] Because they might have leaned to this
[1:17:31] carnal way of saying, "Well, Paul
[1:17:32] baptized me.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; He's the man. He's the prophet of the
[1:17:38] hour. I was baptized by him.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Carnal, immature,
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; divides the church.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; My pastor, he's h he's the cat's meow.
[1:17:49] You guys ought to owe to go to our
[1:17:50] church.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Carnality, immaturity, glorifying flesh
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; divides the body of Christ.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Lest any of you should say that I had
[1:18:01] baptized in my own name, and I baptized
[1:18:03] also the household of Stephanus.
[1:18:05] Besides, I know not whether I baptize
[1:18:06] any other. For Christ sent me not to
[1:18:08] baptize, but to preach the gospel, not
[1:18:10] with wisdom of words, lest the cross of
[1:18:12] Christ should be made none of effect.
[1:18:14] And he goes into this, which you've read
[1:18:16] probably more frequently than the
[1:18:17] scriptures I read before. For the
[1:18:19] preaching of the cross is to them that
[1:18:20] perish foolishness, but unto us which
[1:18:22] are saved. It's the power of God comes
[1:18:24] down to the foolishness of preaching.
[1:18:27] So, always remember that there's not
[1:18:28] some ultra star that's going to be
[1:18:31] lifted above Christ in our ranks. It's
[1:18:34] still flesh. And he chose the
[1:18:36] foolishness of preaching to save people
[1:18:38] because that man is still flesh no
[1:18:40] matter how great his gift is.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; And then he says in through that subject
[1:18:48] 27:29 I want to catch, but God has
[1:18:51] chosen the foolish things of this world
[1:18:53] to confound the wise. And God has chosen
[1:18:54] the weak things of the world to confound
[1:18:56] the things which are mighty and base
[1:18:58] things of the world and things which are
[1:19:00] despised. Hath God chosen yay things
[1:19:03] which are not to bring to not things
[1:19:05] that are why verse 29
[1:19:09] that no flesh should glory in his
[1:19:12] presence.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; We're going to maturity now.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; It is wrong and it it divides when we
[1:19:18] begin to lift up someone in their flesh
[1:19:21] and glorify their gift or their flesh.
[1:19:24] It takes away from the glory of the
[1:19:27] Lord.
[1:19:29] Amen.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; And it divides the church.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; People lift up men too much. Can you say
[1:19:37] amen?
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; People lift up men too much. Even in our
[1:19:41] own rank sometimes dividing over who has
[1:19:44] the best. Dividing over who has the best
[1:19:46] church. Dividing whoever whoever has the
[1:19:49] best teacher in the message, whoever has
[1:19:52] the best. And this is the divide. And
[1:19:54] Paul's rebuking it. It's very
[1:19:56] denominational. Can you say amen?
[1:19:58] Amen.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; I was just having uh breakfast with a
[1:20:01] brother uh that a couple brothers, but
[1:20:04] they said, "I listen, I've been to
[1:20:06] Pentecost. I came out of Pentecost, been
[1:20:09] there, done that, got the t-shirt. There
[1:20:11] was so many attributes of it that became
[1:20:14] wrong and off the word." He said, "I
[1:20:16] didn't come out of Pentecost to go back
[1:20:17] to those attributes again." And one of
[1:20:19] them was all this glorifying of the
[1:20:22] stars and the and the great preachers
[1:20:24] and this guy and this guy. get him in
[1:20:27] for your convention and all this. He
[1:20:28] said, "I seen all that in Pentecost. I'm
[1:20:31] disappointed to see it in our own ranks.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; I'VE COME OUT. I'VE BEEN TO PENTECOST.
[1:20:36] THERE'S NO RAPTURING FAITH BACK THERE."
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; And we are certainly supposed to be
[1:20:44] growing out of
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Pentecostal traditions. And this is one
[1:20:48] of them Paul brought all the way back in
[1:20:52] the Corinthian church. This is going to
[1:20:53] divide the body of Christ. If you say,
[1:20:55] "I'm of here. I'm of
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; I'm of this one.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; I'm of that one."
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Everybody get it?
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Second one. 1 Corinthians 6. Would you
[1:21:06] please? And we have to move through
[1:21:07] these quickly now. And this is the
[1:21:10] second one, which is handling matters
[1:21:12] with immaturity. All right. 1
[1:21:14] Corinthians 6. Darian of you having a
[1:21:16] matter.
[1:21:18] I just underlined that word matter
[1:21:19] because
[1:21:22] matters come up.
[1:21:26] Matters come up.
[1:21:29] If Paul said if you have a matter then
[1:21:31] there was matters
[1:21:34] and it matters how you handle matters.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Put that on your refrigerator this week.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; It's very important. And so dare any of
[1:21:46] you having a matter against one another,
[1:21:48] go to the law before the unjust and not
[1:21:50] before the saints. Do ye not know that
[1:21:52] the saints shall judge the world? And if
[1:21:54] the world shall be judged by you, are
[1:21:56] you unworthy to judge the smallest
[1:21:58] matters?
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; What is he saying? You don't have the
[1:22:02] maturity to handle the smallest matters
[1:22:06] amongst yourself.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; You are so carnal that you couldn't work
[1:22:10] it out amongst yourself. So you had to
[1:22:12] go sue one another and take it to a
[1:22:14] worldly court. This is why we don't
[1:22:16] believe in suing one another. Why?
[1:22:18] Because we should have the maturity to
[1:22:20] deal with matters amongst one another to
[1:22:23] be the adults in the room and come and
[1:22:24] say, "Listen, let's talk about this.
[1:22:26] Let's get this resolved. Let's get this
[1:22:28] reconciled. Let's not gossip about it
[1:22:30] for six months. Let's sit down for
[1:22:32] sometimes it's very short time and we
[1:22:34] work this out. Did you say this about
[1:22:35] me? Did you did you do and you get it
[1:22:37] worked out and when it's over you do
[1:22:39] what's called reconciling." Now, in
[1:22:40] reconciling, you don't necessarily
[1:22:42] always fully agree, but reconcile can
[1:22:45] reconcile even if you don't fully agree.
[1:22:47] Hopefully, you come to an agreement.
[1:22:49] Hopefully, there's repentance.
[1:22:51] Hopefully, if somebody DID SOMETHING
[1:22:52] WRONG, YOU MAKE IT RIGHT. AND WHEN YOU
[1:22:54] MAKE IT RIGHT, BOTH OF you leave that
[1:22:55] room as adults saying, "This is done. It
[1:22:58] is over. I will never let the devil use
[1:23:01] it ever again.
[1:23:04] It's
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; finished. It's reconciled."
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; We've been given the ministry of
[1:23:07] reconciliation.
[1:23:09] reconciling the world to Christ,
[1:23:11] reconciling believers in the seed of God
[1:23:13] to Christ. It's the ministry of
[1:23:15] reconciliation. Well, if that's true on
[1:23:16] a higher level, shouldn't it be true
[1:23:18] among us? Can I get an amen from
[1:23:19] anybody?
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; You You can't let the devil continue to
[1:23:23] use something and fester
[1:23:25] and immaturity is what caused
[1:23:29] them to go to law with one another.
[1:23:30] There's so much in here. I'm going to
[1:23:32] ask you to read a lot of it this week
[1:23:33] yourself. Verse three, know ye not that
[1:23:35] we shall judge angels? how much more
[1:23:37] things that pertain to this life. You
[1:23:39] know what he's saying? We're being
[1:23:41] groomed and we're being prepared
[1:23:42] handling little matters of life here
[1:23:45] because we're going to judge angels
[1:23:46] someday.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; And if we don't have a maturity to judge
[1:23:49] matters between us and our wife and us,
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; we're probably not ready to judge
[1:23:55] angels.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, brother Paul, I'm ready.
[1:24:00] I I I'm going to be a judge some. I'm
[1:24:02] going to rule and reign. Well, your
[1:24:03] whole attitude says, "I don't want you
[1:24:05] ruling and reigning over me."
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; If then ye have judgments of things
[1:24:11] pertaining to this life, set them to
[1:24:13] judge who are least esteemed in the
[1:24:14] church.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; I speak to your shame. Is it so that
[1:24:20] there is not a wise man among you? No,
[1:24:22] not one that shall be able to judge
[1:24:24] between his brother. But, brother,
[1:24:26] that's pretty sad when there's not a
[1:24:28] adult in the room.
[1:24:31] But brother goeth to law with brother,
[1:24:32] and that before the unbelievers. Now
[1:24:34] therefore, there is utterly a fault
[1:24:35] among you, because you go to the law
[1:24:37] with one another. Why do you not rather
[1:24:38] take wrong? Why do you not rather suffer
[1:24:41] yourselves to be defrauded? Nay, you do
[1:24:43] wrong and defraud, and that your
[1:24:44] brethren know ye not that the
[1:24:46] unrighteous shall not inherit the
[1:24:47] kingdom of God. So, let me just skip and
[1:24:49] just add in if I can. Uh, no, that's
[1:24:52] that's the last. So children can't work
[1:24:56] out their fights with one another,
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; They need adults most of the time to
[1:25:02] step in. And so this is sad. That's why
[1:25:05] I say what causes divide is handling
[1:25:08] matters with immaturity. This is a whole
[1:25:10] another sermon and maybe this the Lord
[1:25:12] will let me get into it this year. But
[1:25:14] the whole immature emotional immaturity
[1:25:18] hinders you growing in spiritual
[1:25:20] maturity.
[1:25:25] All right, the third one. 1 Corinthians
[1:25:27] chapter 8.
[1:25:31] And this is intentionally wound a weak
[1:25:33] conscience. 1 Corinthians chapter 8. Now
[1:25:34] as touching things offered unto idols,
[1:25:36] we know that we all have knowledge.
[1:25:38] Knowledge puffth up, but charity
[1:25:40] edifith.
[1:25:42] Divine love will to will edify, would
[1:25:44] build up. Pride will tear down. And if
[1:25:47] any man think he knoweth anything, he
[1:25:49] knoweth nothing, yet he ought to know.
[1:25:52] But if any man love God the same is
[1:25:53] known of him, as concerning therefore
[1:25:55] the eating of those things which are
[1:25:56] offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know
[1:25:58] that an idol is nothing in the world,
[1:26:00] and that there is none other god but
[1:26:02] one. We know that. So in other words,
[1:26:04] this big issue of um the Jews were
[1:26:08] taught not to eat any meat sacrificed to
[1:26:10] idols. We realize that with Daniel and
[1:26:12] all the the stories. And then the
[1:26:14] Gentiles ate things and they were to
[1:26:17] other gods. So you have this tension
[1:26:19] because people were hesitant of what
[1:26:21] they ate.
[1:26:24] It made him cause they have a lack of
[1:26:25] faith. Is that is that from uh is that
[1:26:28] sacrifice to idols? Well, where did this
[1:26:29] meat come from? And so it made him a
[1:26:31] little nervous. And Paul says, "But we
[1:26:33] have the knowledge uh we know that the
[1:26:35] idols nothing in the world and there's
[1:26:37] none other god but one. For though there
[1:26:39] be that are called gods, whether in
[1:26:41] heaven or earth, as there be God's many
[1:26:43] and lords many, but to us there is but
[1:26:45] one God, the Father, of whom are all
[1:26:47] things, and we in him, and one Lord
[1:26:49] Jesus Christ, by whom are all things,
[1:26:51] and by we by him. How be it, there's not
[1:26:53] in every how be it there's not in every
[1:26:55] man that knowledge. For some with
[1:26:58] conscience of the idol unto this hour,
[1:27:00] eat it as a thing offered unto an idol,
[1:27:03] and their conscience being weak, is
[1:27:05] defiled. But meat commendeth not us not
[1:27:08] to God. For neither if we eat are we
[1:27:10] better, neither if we eat not are we
[1:27:12] worse. But take heed. This is the
[1:27:15] warning. Lest by any means this liberty
[1:27:18] of yours become a stumbling block to
[1:27:20] them that are weak.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; So we could say, well my goodness, grow
[1:27:26] up. There's nothing to that idol. It
[1:27:28] doesn't mean anything. There's no other
[1:27:29] gods except our God. Go ahead and eat
[1:27:31] it. But you see, if they're weak yet, we
[1:27:34] wait until they're strong. We don't get
[1:27:35] an attitude, you're way behind, you're
[1:27:38] so, you know, we don't get that attitude
[1:27:41] and we're actually, if we in our
[1:27:42] attitude create a stumbling block for a
[1:27:45] weak one, we're dividing the church.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Verse 10, for if any man see thee which
[1:27:57] hath knowledge, sit at me to the idol's
[1:27:59] temple, shall not the conscious of him
[1:28:00] that is weak be emboldened to eat those
[1:28:02] things which are offered to idols? and
[1:28:04] through thy knowledge shall the weak
[1:28:06] brother perish for whom Christ died. But
[1:28:08] when we should never want that to happen
[1:28:11] that a weak brother gives up
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; because of our actions,
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; because we're flaunting it. I have this
[1:28:22] liberty. It doesn't bother me at all.
[1:28:24] You know,
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; that's just as wrong as the brother
[1:28:27] that's weak.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; That's what Paul's teaching.
[1:28:32] We should never want to put a stumbling
[1:28:34] block in front of anybody's way. And I
[1:28:36] won't have time to go into it today. The
[1:28:37] more Paul talks about it. We are in a
[1:28:40] suffering. We are in a sacrifice. And we
[1:28:42] sacrifice our own wants and wishes and
[1:28:45] even sometimes our little liberties
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; in the name of maintaining unity in the
[1:28:51] body of Christ.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; I tell ministers this as I've been
[1:28:55] privileged to train some of them or at
[1:28:56] least talk to them about what we do. And
[1:28:59] I say, "You know what ministry is? It's
[1:29:00] not just being behind the pulpit.
[1:29:02] There's several places Paul says to
[1:29:04] Timothy and different ones. It's the
[1:29:05] suffering and it's the sacrifices you
[1:29:07] will make so that you can live a life
[1:29:10] that the people have confidence in you.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; But most young preachers, young
[1:29:14] ministers, and some that aren't even
[1:29:15] called, they just want pulpit time.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; But ministry is so much more than pulpit
[1:29:20] time.
[1:29:22] When you look ahead and see the
[1:29:24] sacrifices you'll make as a minister,
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; probably a lot of them would bow out
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; because you suffer, you sacrifice, you
[1:29:32] your family sacrif
[1:29:34] they've sacrificed things in the name of
[1:29:38] presenting the very best of this message
[1:29:41] to the church of God.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Verse 11 verse but verse 12. But when ye
[1:29:50] sin, so against the brethren, and wound
[1:29:53] their weak conscience, ye sin against
[1:29:55] Christ. Wow, that's pretty strong.
[1:29:57] Wherefore, if meat make thy brother to
[1:29:58] offend, I will eat no flesh, while the
[1:30:00] world standeth, lest I make my brother
[1:30:02] to offend.
[1:30:04] All right. And that's where he says it
[1:30:05] in chapter 9:12. If others be partakers
[1:30:08] of this power over you, are we not
[1:30:10] rather, nevertheless, we have not used
[1:30:11] this power, but suffer all things lest
[1:30:14] we should hinder the gospel of Christ.
[1:30:16] So he's saying even as far as giving, I
[1:30:19] have the power to take the giving, but
[1:30:20] I'm I'm not going to take that because
[1:30:22] I'm going to suffer that cuz I don't
[1:30:24] want somebody to be stumbled by that.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; That's maturity.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; That's maturity. All right. So now
[1:30:32] number four.
[1:30:35] Uh okay. Where where am I at now? Now go
[1:30:38] to chapter 10 if you would.
[1:30:43] Which number are we on? Okay. Number
[1:30:46] three, okay,
[1:30:48] chapter 10 and verse 23, he deals with
[1:30:52] it again. All things are lawful for me,
[1:30:56] but all things are not expedient.
[1:30:58] All things are lawful for me, but all
[1:31:00] things don't edify. So Paul lives in a
[1:31:03] freedom here. He doesn't live by a law.
[1:31:06] He doesn't live by something that's just
[1:31:09] no relationship with Christ that it's
[1:31:11] just dos and don'ts.
[1:31:13] All things are lawful, but all things
[1:31:16] are not experienced. And all things
[1:31:17] don't edify. So if you're going to go
[1:31:19] out and say, "I'm allowed to do this. I
[1:31:20] can do this." But it doesn't edify
[1:31:23] someone else. It actually tears someone
[1:31:24] else. It hinders their conscience.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Be careful of that.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Because everything we do is to edify, is
[1:31:32] to build up the body of Christ.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Let no man seek his own, but every man
[1:31:37] another's wealth.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever. See that? See, that goes to
[1:31:41] the un the unselfishness. Whatsoever
[1:31:43] sold in the sha. Okay, let's let's just
[1:31:45] catch 23 through 33.
[1:31:49] Okay, he's still dealing with it. So, we
[1:31:51] don't want to excuse me for just slowing
[1:31:53] down here. I I'll be mindful of the
[1:31:56] time, but I want to slow down and make
[1:31:58] sure we catch these things.
[1:32:00] For if the uh verse 25, whatever is sold
[1:32:03] in shambles that eat, asking no
[1:32:05] questions for conscience sake, for the
[1:32:06] earth is the Lord's and the fullness
[1:32:07] thereof. If any of them that believe not
[1:32:09] bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed
[1:32:12] to go, whatsoever is set before you, a
[1:32:14] eat, asking no questions for conscience
[1:32:16] sake. But if any man say unto you, this
[1:32:17] is offered in sacrifice unto idols. Eat
[1:32:20] not for his sake, that showed it uh and
[1:32:23] for conscience sake, for the earth is
[1:32:24] the Lord's and the fullness thereof.
[1:32:26] Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of
[1:32:28] the other. For why is my liberty judged
[1:32:31] of another man's conscience? For if I by
[1:32:33] grace be a partaker, why am I even spo
[1:32:36] evil spoken of? for that which I give
[1:32:38] thanks. Whether therefore ye eat or
[1:32:41] drink or whatsoever you do, do all to
[1:32:43] the glory of who?
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Give not offense, neither to Jews, nor
[1:32:48] Gentiles, nor to the church of God, even
[1:32:50] as I please all men in all things, not
[1:32:52] seeking my own profit, but the profit of
[1:32:55] many, that they may be saved. What's it
[1:33:01] about? Unselfishness.
[1:33:04] It's about living a life of o to others,
[1:33:07] not just selfishly. I'm going to do this
[1:33:10] myself. I have the liberty to do this.
[1:33:13] So when you talk about number four,
[1:33:15] selfish and self-centered, that covers
[1:33:17] it. That that chapter covered it. Is
[1:33:19] that when he says the profit, we're in
[1:33:21] this for the profit of not just
[1:33:23] ourselves,
[1:33:25] but the spiritual profit of ourselves
[1:33:27] and others too. So if your profiting
[1:33:29] spiritually is not profiting others and
[1:33:32] actually discouraging others, there's
[1:33:34] something wrong with that.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; There's something wrong with that.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Let's go to number five. Number five
[1:33:40] says, "Living a different life at home
[1:33:41] than at church." Now in 1 Corinthians 5,
[1:33:45] uh in 1 Corinthians 5, back to first 5,
[1:33:48] it is reported commonly that there's
[1:33:49] fornication among you, and such
[1:33:50] fornication as is not so much as named
[1:33:53] among the Gentiles that one should have
[1:33:54] his father's wife. So, there's a bit of
[1:33:56] an incest thing going on in the church.
[1:33:59] In the church,
[1:34:02] uh a uh a man is getting with his uh uh
[1:34:08] stepmom and is committing wrong things
[1:34:11] with her. This is in the church. This is
[1:34:13] in the message ranks.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Unfortunately, it's not supposed to be
[1:34:18] named among us, but these things can
[1:34:20] happen. It's a shame when it happens,
[1:34:22] but it happens. It happened in the
[1:34:24] Corinthian church.
[1:34:25] under Paul the prophet
[1:34:29] and I'm just going to I'm going to
[1:34:30] summarize so we don't have to read all
[1:34:31] you know what happens where Paul rebukes
[1:34:33] this and the reason I say living a
[1:34:36] different life at home in the church
[1:34:37] that's what he's going to correct but
[1:34:38] one of the things he corrects is how the
[1:34:40] Corinthian church was acting they were
[1:34:42] actually covering for it they were
[1:34:43] pretending it wasn't happening and this
[1:34:45] boy was coming taking communion being a
[1:34:47] part of the service probably got his
[1:34:48] hands lifted he's worshiping you know
[1:34:50] and everybody begins to learn he's
[1:34:52] having an improper relationship with his
[1:34:54] stepmom know, and the church knew it was
[1:34:56] going on and didn't do anything about
[1:34:59] it. Well, he's worshiping. Just let him
[1:35:01] come and worship. So, I'm hoping I bring
[1:35:04] a balance today that that can divide the
[1:35:07] church as well.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Is that we're letting sin just sit there
[1:35:12] and not do something about it.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; And Paul said, "Deliver up such a one."
[1:35:18] They took him out from underneath the
[1:35:19] blood. We rarely do that. But Paul says
[1:35:21] this is something to shake that person
[1:35:23] to say you're dealing with the body of
[1:35:25] Christ. You're dealing you're
[1:35:26] disrespecting the body of Christ and so
[1:35:28] we'll let you to yourself and let God
[1:35:30] deal with you. Okay? And the church had
[1:35:32] to act mature to do that.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Is anybody on board? That takes a
[1:35:38] maturity, a love in maturity to deal
[1:35:41] with that situation. So we don't if we
[1:35:43] don't deal with that, that's hurting the
[1:35:45] person. We It's hurting the body. It's
[1:35:48] hurting everybody else. And so he's
[1:35:50] telling the church, you're being very
[1:35:52] immature and not dealing with that.
[1:35:53] You're pretending. Listen,
[1:35:56] you I'm going to get to the other side
[1:35:57] of this a minute. How we handle matters
[1:35:59] that we see in the church. But if you
[1:36:01] see something, you need to go to prayer
[1:36:03] because you don't want that sin. If you
[1:36:05] hear something, wait till it's
[1:36:07] confirmed. But be careful what you say.
[1:36:09] You need to go to the Lord. Say, "Lord,
[1:36:11] don't let that sin go." God expose that
[1:36:13] thing. And God may even do use you to do
[1:36:17] it, but we're not going to let it go on.
[1:36:19] And we're going to pray because it will
[1:36:21] divide the body. It will spread to other
[1:36:24] places. I've watched congregations and
[1:36:26] if adultery stop starts, if you don't
[1:36:28] nip it in the bud, it just keeps passing
[1:36:30] throughout the congregation.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Leadership has to deal with it. Someone
[1:36:33] has to do it. Well, let the Holy Ghost
[1:36:35] deal with it. But you got to act on what
[1:36:37] the Holy Ghost is doing to deal with
[1:36:38] that sin in the camp.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's maybe it's the preacher. Well,
[1:36:44] uh, oh, we don't want to ruin his
[1:36:46] ministry. We don't want to. No, don't
[1:36:47] say nothing. Don't No, you're obligated.
[1:36:49] If it's sin,
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; you're obligated to say something to the
[1:36:53] right people and get this sin dealt
[1:36:55] with.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Something wrong with the preacher who
[1:36:57] want to live. You're helping him
[1:36:59] pretend. You're helping him. And that's
[1:37:01] what Paul's saying in this chapter is
[1:37:04] that they're not they're they're living
[1:37:06] a different life at home than they are
[1:37:08] in the church. And letting that sin go
[1:37:11] on is not something. So you read that if
[1:37:13] you would on your own. Uh he said, "Put
[1:37:15] away that there can be no leaven in the
[1:37:17] lump." And you know, I think it's it's
[1:37:20] pretty straight how he deals with that.
[1:37:22] But here's here's the other side. Second
[1:37:24] Corinthians 2, this is forgiveness now
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; because God dealt with this man.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; And in second Corinthians chapter 2, God
[1:37:35] dealt with him. He repented and he
[1:37:38] wanted to be restored back to the
[1:37:40] church.
[1:37:42] And the people were hesitant.
[1:37:46] Paul has to address it again.
[1:37:49] And he even says here, I was pretty
[1:37:51] straightforward how you should handle
[1:37:52] that situation. But now that he's
[1:37:55] repented, let's read what happens here.
[1:37:57] Because if you have just all correction
[1:37:59] without forgiving someone who's come
[1:38:02] back to God,
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; we're going to give you about five years
[1:38:06] to prove yourself.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Be careful of those limits you put on
[1:38:10] things. God can restore heart in a
[1:38:13] second.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; They may have to grow, but you don't
[1:38:17] know where that heart is. And so you
[1:38:19] don't set time limits on you being
[1:38:21] cordial to them,
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; you treating them right.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; You see,
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; so it was I'm glad this was in here.
[1:38:29] It's in here for a reason. 2 Corinthians
[1:38:31] chapter 2 verse one. But I determined
[1:38:34] this with myself that I would not come
[1:38:35] again to you in heaviness. For if I make
[1:38:37] you sorry, who is he then that maketh me
[1:38:39] glad? but the same which is sorry by me.
[1:38:41] And I wrote this same unto you less when
[1:38:43] I came, I should have sorrow from them
[1:38:45] of whom I ought to rejoice, having
[1:38:47] confidence in you all, that my joy is
[1:38:49] the joy of you all. For out of much
[1:38:51] affliction and anguish of heart, I wrote
[1:38:52] unto you with many tears. Paul didn't
[1:38:55] want to have to write that for them to
[1:38:57] deal with that. Not that you should be
[1:38:59] grieved, but that might that ye might
[1:39:01] know the love which I have more
[1:39:02] abundantly unto you. But if any have
[1:39:04] caused grief, he has not grieved me, but
[1:39:06] in part that I might not overcharge you.
[1:39:08] sufficient to man to such a man is this
[1:39:11] punishment which was inflicted on many.
[1:39:13] Took him out from underneath the blood.
[1:39:15] Let God deal with them at that time. And
[1:39:17] I've heard it said, be careful of you
[1:39:19] making contact with somebody like that
[1:39:21] and trying to, you know, just out of
[1:39:23] your emotions, you know, oh, I hope they
[1:39:25] don't feel so bad. Leave them alone to
[1:39:27] God.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Let God deal with them his own way. This
[1:39:31] happened. He came back sufficient to
[1:39:34] such a man as his punishment which was
[1:39:35] afflicted of many. So that contritewise
[1:39:38] ye ought rather to forgive him and
[1:39:41] comfort him, lest perhaps such one be
[1:39:43] swallowed up with over much sorrow.
[1:39:46] Wherefore I beseech you that ye would
[1:39:47] confirm your love towards him. Can I get
[1:39:50] an amen?
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; For to this end also I did write that I
[1:39:54] might know the proof of you whether you
[1:39:56] be obedient in all things. To whom we
[1:39:58] forgive anything, I forgive also. For I
[1:40:00] forgave anything to whom I forgave it.
[1:40:02] For your sakes forgave I it in the
[1:40:04] person of Christ. lest Satan should get
[1:40:07] an advantage of us, for we are not
[1:40:09] ignorant of his devices. Well, here's a
[1:40:12] way Satan can get in to cause divide, a
[1:40:15] lack of forgiveness.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; And he'll get the advantage over us if
[1:40:21] we have a lack of forgiveness to say,
[1:40:24] "Brother, I thank the Lord that you have
[1:40:26] been restored. I embrace you. I comfort
[1:40:28] you. I will encourage you in the Lord."
[1:40:31] Amen.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; I will say I'm so straight and forward
[1:40:34] this morning and corrective that I will
[1:40:37] compliment this congregation that we do
[1:40:39] get compliments from those outside that
[1:40:42] come and those who have been in sin that
[1:40:47] when they came back they were not
[1:40:49] belittled. They were not looked down on.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; The congregation rejoiced that they were
[1:40:54] back.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; If you're back this morning we rejoice
[1:40:58] that you're back. God bless you.
[1:41:01] [Applause]
[1:41:05] Just come and be broken with us
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; and come and grow with us. Cuz if
[1:41:10] everybody say everybody, I know what it
[1:41:12] means to be broken.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; I'm still broken in some ways,
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; but I'm under the right word. Can you
[1:41:19] say amen?
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Let's do the last one. The last one is
[1:41:22] uh personal preferences lifted too high.
[1:41:25] Wish I had about an hour on this. But
[1:41:27] now we go to Romans chapter 14.
[1:41:32] We go back to where he's actually
[1:41:34] dealing with the eating meat and things
[1:41:35] like that. But this takes a little bit
[1:41:37] deeper. Romans 14:1. Him that is weak in
[1:41:39] the faith rejoice receive ye but not to
[1:41:43] doubtful disputation. So now the way
[1:41:45] Paul's saying it here
[1:41:48] is that him that is weak, weak
[1:41:51] conscience, we talked about before,
[1:41:53] someone who is not strong yet receive
[1:41:56] but not to doubtful disputations. And
[1:41:58] years ago, the Lord taught me what
[1:42:00] doubtful disputations. And when I looked
[1:42:02] it up, what it everybody put their seat
[1:42:04] belts on now, okay? Because you're going
[1:42:06] to need some maturity to look at this.
[1:42:09] Doubtful disputations has one meaning
[1:42:12] that said things that are not
[1:42:14] expressingly black and white in the
[1:42:16] scripture.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Boy, you're on scary territory, brother
[1:42:24] Paul. Because we think that things are
[1:42:27] just expressingly black and white in the
[1:42:29] scripture and the message. And I'm here
[1:42:31] to tell you sometimes it's not.
[1:42:35] And maybe God allowed some of the things
[1:42:37] as a test for us to let our character
[1:42:40] kick in instead of our religious pride
[1:42:44] to take that thing and make it a
[1:42:46] religion for us and everybody else.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; And he calls it disputations because
[1:42:56] they're doubtful things, but they're
[1:42:58] things that cause arguments. That's why
[1:42:59] I make the seventh one the last one here
[1:43:01] is that when we take our personal
[1:43:03] opinions or our things that aren't
[1:43:05] necessarily you got a lot of strong
[1:43:06] message on and you lift it up as being
[1:43:09] this is A STANDARD AND EVERYBODY OUGHT
[1:43:11] TO BE ON that standard. It creates
[1:43:14] division and it creates disputations and
[1:43:19] it creates arguments in the body of
[1:43:21] Christ. And when you peel back the
[1:43:23] layers you don't have too much to stand
[1:43:25] on. It's just a personal opinion.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; You're preaching it as if it's message.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; I have a beard today.
[1:43:36] But when I was a kid in our ranks, of
[1:43:41] course, I couldn't had beard then. There
[1:43:44] was nothing coming out. I'm not looking
[1:43:46] at you guys. No.
[1:43:49] But when it finally came out at I don't
[1:43:52] know 50 years old, I said, "Okay, I
[1:43:54] finally got one. and I'm used. But back
[1:43:56] then, my dad, he was he and this is an
[1:44:00] example of laying down your life for
[1:44:02] ministry. He he had a mustache
[1:44:06] and uh so then God called him out some
[1:44:09] places to preach. Well, the first place
[1:44:11] he went somewhere in Ohio, first place
[1:44:13] he went, the pastor was offended because
[1:44:15] he preached against mustaches. He said
[1:44:17] it's wrong. And he said there's some He
[1:44:21] said there's a quote. Brother Ram says
[1:44:23] when when the man has a mustache, he's
[1:44:25] hiding something.
[1:44:28] Said there's a quote.
[1:44:30] Oh, Brother Ken, are you here today? Ken
[1:44:32] Slacka. He's not here.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Ken's been with me since we
[1:44:40] started the church. But Brother Ken and
[1:44:42] I have been looking for that quote for
[1:44:44] 40 years.
[1:44:47] We still can't find it.
[1:44:52] What?
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Upper lip.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; It's only hiding his upper lip. That's
[1:44:56] true.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Technically, it could be right. He's
[1:44:59] hiding his upper lip.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; You know what my dad did, though? He
[1:45:04] went home. I remember this as a kid. He
[1:45:06] shaved it off.
[1:45:09] Now, did he have to? No. But if he was
[1:45:12] going to get invitations, and that was
[1:45:14] an issue back then, he didn't want to go
[1:45:17] in and offend anybody and that be a
[1:45:19] stumbling block. So, he couldn't
[1:45:21] minister to the people.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine being up there and you
[1:45:24] got your mustache, you know, hanging out
[1:45:27] and only 80% of the people are going to
[1:45:30] receive what you're preaching.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; I'm I am taken back. I'm leaving here. I
[1:45:36] can't believe he's got a mustache.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; So, I teach ministers sometimes is that
[1:45:41] this is the sacrifices you'll make
[1:45:43] sometimes.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Is it important you just go preach or is
[1:45:46] it important you live a life that's
[1:45:48] sacrificial?
[1:45:50] Actually, the first time I heard Gloria
[1:45:51] Gaither speak, she said the same thing.
[1:45:52] She says, "We go to churches from the
[1:45:54] very beginning." And she says, "If we
[1:45:56] learn they believe a certain thing,
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; she said, "I'll tell my girls that are
[1:46:00] going to be on stage to back off of
[1:46:02] dressing that way because we don't want
[1:46:03] to offend that church."
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; God bless her.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Most of the music world is not stuck
[1:46:09] with that principle, but it's a biblical
[1:46:10] principle.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; They don't we don't just go and flaunt
[1:46:14] things. And so the principle here that
[1:46:16] I'm trying to teach you is and Paul says
[1:46:18] in the Bible is that we don't re we
[1:46:21] receive but not to doubtful
[1:46:23] dispensations. In other words, we we
[1:46:25] have fellowship together but don't make
[1:46:28] those things cause arguments and
[1:46:31] divisions.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; It's not worth it.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; What are those things, brother Paul? I'm
[1:46:39] not gonna talk about those
[1:46:41] because if I get into that it just gets
[1:46:44] into personal opinion. I mean for years
[1:46:46] it's like the basketball out here and
[1:46:49] there should be no sports. First time I
[1:46:51] went to Honduras I was in a pickle
[1:46:53] because they're asking me they had
[1:46:55] questions and answers and I got the
[1:46:57] young people on this side probably 200
[1:46:59] young people and I got all the ministers
[1:47:01] all mostly in Honduras over here and the
[1:47:03] old generation said you couldn't play
[1:47:04] any sports at all. It was against the
[1:47:06] word.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; And the young people sent the question
[1:47:09] up to me. Is it okay to play volleyball?
[1:47:11] Is it okay to play soccer?
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Mhm. That's the kind of things you get
[1:47:17] in the middle of
[1:47:19] the Lord gave me an answer. It was real
[1:47:21] simple. Well, I said, "Brothers," I
[1:47:23] said, "I know hunting is a sport."
[1:47:28] And
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; guess what? It settled it.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; It's a prophet. He He was a hunter.
[1:47:35] That's right.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Hunting is I'm telling you it the place
[1:47:38] calmed down. They've been playing
[1:47:40] volleyball ever since I left. That was
[1:47:42] 30 years ago. And soccer.
[1:47:47] I If you hear that, I was the cause of
[1:47:49] it.
[1:47:50] But there's not a thing. It's It's not
[1:47:52] the thing. It's the thing what people
[1:47:54] make out of it. If it's a spirit of
[1:47:56] competition, that's wrong. If it's going
[1:47:58] in all these places with a bunch of
[1:47:59] naked bodies, that's wrong.
[1:48:02] You see, but I brought it in front of my
[1:48:04] church. I I brought it because I had to
[1:48:06] deal with 20, 30 years ago. I dealt with
[1:48:08] the subject of Christmas. I dealt with
[1:48:10] subject of basketball. I brought a
[1:48:12] basketball to church and I held it in
[1:48:14] front of the people. I said, "There's no
[1:48:15] sin IN THIS BASKETBALL. THERE'S NOTHING
[1:48:17] IN IT." PAUL said there's nothing of sin
[1:48:19] of itself. There's nothing evil of
[1:48:21] itself. It's not the instrument. It's
[1:48:23] what you do with it. It's the spirits
[1:48:25] that can go with it.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Held it in front of the church. Is that,
[1:48:28] you know, AT TIMES WE'RE GOING TO PLAY
[1:48:29] BASKETBALL HERE.
[1:48:31] There's not a thing wrong for the boys
[1:48:33] to do that. If they got caught up up in
[1:48:35] it, if they started to wear their hair
[1:48:37] like basketball stars,
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; we got a problem.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; It's an identity problem.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; But the innocence of playing volleyball
[1:48:46] or basketball, incidentally, uh Clayton,
[1:48:48] he's doing tremendous on his team there
[1:48:50] at Stateline. My boys all played
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; and thank God for his Christian example.
[1:48:55] He's in a Christian school, but thank
[1:48:56] God he's a light in that school. And uh
[1:48:59] he does pretty good job there. I got I
[1:49:02] understand we got some young football
[1:49:04] players too, right? All right. Yep. Let
[1:49:07] me know when you're playing.
[1:49:10] Come out and see how well you do.
[1:49:13] But you know, it's like all these things
[1:49:15] I'm not going to see. I mentioned one
[1:49:18] Christmas. I'm not even getting into
[1:49:20] that.
[1:49:22] But later scripture says, "One man
[1:49:25] esteemth one day above another day." And
[1:49:28] that was in the body of Christ.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; And if you don't esteem it, well, praise
[1:49:33] the Lord. But don't you dare lift
[1:49:35] something up.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; It's really funny. Last week after
[1:49:41] Christmas, let me say this.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; I get some responses. H that's a little
[1:49:47] too much. And then I get these quotes
[1:49:50] sent to me that Brother Random says, "We
[1:49:52] got some gifts for the kids today at
[1:49:53] Christmas. They're under the tree." And
[1:49:55] I'm going, where's the tree at?
[1:49:59] So, I've got to research that. But I'm
[1:50:00] just saying to you, we cannot carnally
[1:50:04] take things
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; and make them into something that would
[1:50:08] cause divide.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; We should respect every person and where
[1:50:13] they stand.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; And whatsoever is not of faith is sin.
[1:50:16] In other words, brother Brand says, if
[1:50:18] you have a doubt about something, don't
[1:50:19] do it.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; And if you go do something, oh, they're
[1:50:23] doing it, so I'm going to go do it. No,
[1:50:24] no, no. What sort of faith? If you can't
[1:50:26] do it in faith, then I'd be hesitant of
[1:50:28] that.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; But I do will tell you, you better check
[1:50:31] out and let the word balance you out
[1:50:33] because a lot of times for years we
[1:50:35] heard this was said, this was said and
[1:50:37] it made a standard and they're not
[1:50:38] standards at all
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; in the word. I've got things brothers
[1:50:42] are quoting sometimes and I hold my
[1:50:44] tongue because not in this church but
[1:50:46] other churches that I'm going to ask
[1:50:47] them where what what Bible scripture do
[1:50:50] you have to preach that and what quote
[1:50:51] because there's none and you're
[1:50:52] preaching it.
[1:50:54] I say if God has given us the
[1:50:57] stabilizers in the ship, his word, we
[1:50:59] ought to hang our lives close to what he
[1:51:01] said
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; and not our own opinions.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; I'm not got a bad attitude. I I think
[1:51:11] everyone is entitled to my opinion.
[1:51:17] Fusses come over preferences. Can you
[1:51:20] say amen? Would you mind reading this? I
[1:51:22] think they got it here. Would you mind
[1:51:24] giving me a few more minutes?
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; I'm getting close. But let's read Romans
[1:51:28] 14 in the Amplified just so we
[1:51:30] understand what it means. Romans 14:14.
[1:51:32] I don't know if Ian got that for me or
[1:51:34] not, but this is the Amplified.
[1:51:36] And you can read along. Ro, excuse me.
[1:51:38] No, it'd be Romans.
[1:51:40] Yes. Romans 14
[1:51:43] and verse
[1:51:47] I think it goes back to verse one. As
[1:51:50] for those ones whose f faith is weak,
[1:51:52] accept him into your fellowship, but not
[1:51:54] for the purpose of quarreling over his
[1:51:56] opinions. One man's faith permits him to
[1:51:58] eat everything, while the weak believer
[1:52:00] eats only vegetables to avoid eating
[1:52:02] ritually unclean meat or something
[1:52:04] previously considered unclean. The one
[1:52:06] who eats everything is not to look down
[1:52:08] on the one who does not eat.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; And the one who does not eat must not
[1:52:14] criticize or pass judgment on the one
[1:52:17] who eats everything.
[1:52:19] It's probably me.
[1:52:26] Oh Lord, I'm glad my wife's not here to
[1:52:28] hear that.
[1:52:31] For God has accepted him. Who are you to
[1:52:33] judge the servant of another?
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Before his own master, he stands
[1:52:38] approved or falls out of favor. And he
[1:52:42] who serves the master, the Lord will
[1:52:44] stand for the Lord is able to make him
[1:52:46] stand.
[1:52:47] I would like to preach another sermon.
[1:52:49] Who are you to judge another man's
[1:52:51] servant?
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; Who are YOU TO PREACH ACROSS your pulpit
[1:52:57] and slam another man how he's leading
[1:53:00] his church?
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; He doesn't come under YOU AS MASTER. HE
[1:53:04] HAS A MASTER AND THAT'S THE LORD.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; SO HOW GOD LEADS HIM TO LEAD THAT
[1:53:10] CHURCH, WE OUGHT TO LEAVE IT ALONE. We
[1:53:12] ought to support it. We ought to pray
[1:53:13] for them. BUT IMMATURITY IS BASHING THEM
[1:53:16] FOR HOW they're leading the church.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; So who are you to judge another? So
[1:53:24] verse five, one person regards one day
[1:53:26] as a better, one more important than
[1:53:28] another, while another regards every day
[1:53:30] the same as another day. Let everyone be
[1:53:32] f fully persuaded, assured in his own
[1:53:34] mind. Can you say amen?
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; I looked up the unofficial holidays and
[1:53:40] all the things that sep celebrate.
[1:53:41] There's like hundreds of them now. Ice
[1:53:44] cream for Breakfast Day,
[1:53:47] International Cat Day,
[1:53:50] International Clients Day, International
[1:53:52] Dark Sky Day, International
[1:53:55] No Diet Day.
[1:53:58] That should come after the ice cream for
[1:53:59] breakfast. International Students Day.
[1:54:02] International Surfing Day. No, that one
[1:54:05] should come after eating ice cream for
[1:54:07] breakfast. Surfing. That would be good.
[1:54:09] international talk like a pirate day. I
[1:54:11] couldn't believe all of them,
[1:54:14] but
[1:54:16] I thought it was kind of funny because
[1:54:17] someone could say, "Yes, I want to
[1:54:19] celebrate this day. I want to celebrate
[1:54:22] this this National Dog Day or I want to
[1:54:26] celebrate this we eat this certain thing
[1:54:29] day."
[1:54:31] No problem. You have the freedom to go
[1:54:33] do it. Just don't come and tell me
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; to make it a church doctrine.
[1:54:39] We ought to bring this in here. We, you
[1:54:41] know, this is I found some quotes on
[1:54:43] this and I found a scripture. We ought
[1:54:45] to incorporate this. I'm not interested
[1:54:47] in incorporating anything that's not on
[1:54:49] the pure balanced word of God or adding
[1:54:51] anything or taking anything away because
[1:54:53] every time you add to this MESSAGE SOME
[1:54:56] STANDARD THAT'S NOT REALLY THERE, you
[1:54:58] bind the people up.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; THERE'S ONLY FREEDOM IN TRUTH.
[1:55:05] [Applause]
[1:55:07] been around too many years where they
[1:55:08] attach something and I'm trying to find
[1:55:10] that quote on mustaches and every time
[1:55:12] you do it, you bind people up
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; with standards that aren't there.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Now, all the ones that are standards,
[1:55:21] I'm going to preach them. I'm not going
[1:55:22] to leave anything out for anybody's
[1:55:24] feelings. That's my duty as a pastor. If
[1:55:26] God leads ME TO READ THAT QUOTE, I'm
[1:55:28] going to read it. And if it takes the
[1:55:29] very hide off of the people, I'm going
[1:55:31] to do it.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; If it's the word,
[1:55:35] But I have no business adding to it or
[1:55:37] you setting a certain day. What if so?
[1:55:39] So so let's finish the scripture. He
[1:55:41] says one person regards the day verse
[1:55:43] five better more important than the
[1:55:45] other while other regards every day. Let
[1:55:47] everyone be fully convinced assured
[1:55:49] satisfies in his own mind. He who
[1:55:50] observes the day observes it for the
[1:55:52] Lord. He who eats eats for the Lord
[1:55:54] since he gives thanks to God. While he
[1:55:57] abstains abstains for the Lord and gives
[1:55:59] thanks to God. None of us lives for
[1:56:00] himself, for his own benefit, but for
[1:56:03] the Lord. And none of us dies for
[1:56:05] himself, but for the Lord. If we live,
[1:56:06] we live for the Lord. If we die, we die
[1:56:08] for the Lord. So then, whether we live
[1:56:10] or die, we are the Lords. For Christ
[1:56:12] died and lived again for this reason,
[1:56:14] that he might be the Lord both of the
[1:56:16] dead and the living. But you, WHY DO YOU
[1:56:18] CRITICIZE YOUR BROTHER? OR YOU AGAIN,
[1:56:20] WHY do you look down on your believing
[1:56:21] brother or REGARD HIM WITH CONTEMPT? FOR
[1:56:24] WE WILL ALL STAND BEFORE THE JUDGMENT
[1:56:26] seat of God, who alone is judged. For it
[1:56:28] is written, as I live the Lord, every
[1:56:30] knee shall bow and every t tongue shall
[1:56:31] confess praise to God. So then each of
[1:56:34] us will give an account of himself to
[1:56:35] God. Then let us not criticize one
[1:56:37] another anymore, but rather determine
[1:56:39] this, not to put an obstacle or
[1:56:41] stumbling block or a source of
[1:56:43] temptation in another believer's way. I
[1:56:45] know him, I am convinced as one in the
[1:56:48] Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean,
[1:56:50] ritually, defiled, or unholy in itself,
[1:56:53] but nonetheless, it is unclean to anyone
[1:56:55] who thinks it is unclean. If your
[1:56:57] brother is being hurt, offended because
[1:56:58] of food that you insist on eating, you
[1:57:01] are no longer walking in love towards
[1:57:03] him. Do not let what you eat destroy and
[1:57:05] spiritually harm one for whom Christ
[1:57:07] died. Therefore, do not let what is good
[1:57:09] a good thing for you because of your
[1:57:12] freedom to choose be spoken of as evil
[1:57:14] by someone else. For the kingdom of God
[1:57:16] is not a matter of eating and drinking
[1:57:18] what one likes.
[1:57:22] The kingdom of God is not eating or
[1:57:24] drinking or what one likes but of
[1:57:26] righteousness and peace and joy in the
[1:57:28] Holy Spirit. For the one who serves
[1:57:30] Christ in this way, recognizing that
[1:57:32] food choices secondary is acceptable to
[1:57:35] God and is approved by men. So then let
[1:57:37] us pursue with enthusiasm the things
[1:57:39] which make for peace and the building up
[1:57:41] of one another, things which lead to
[1:57:43] spiritual growth. Do not for the sake of
[1:57:45] food tear down THE WORK OF GOD.
[1:57:49] DON'T LIFT YOUR PERSONAL OPINION, YOUR
[1:57:51] PERSONAL DOCTRINE or thing that's not
[1:57:53] scripturally or message-based enough.
[1:57:56] Don't lift it up WHERE IT CAUSES OFFENSE
[1:57:59] and divide in the body.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; Verse 22,
[1:58:07] the faith which you have that gives you
[1:58:08] freedom of choice has have you as your
[1:58:10] own conviction before God. Just keep it
[1:58:12] between yourself and God seeking his
[1:58:14] will. Happy is he who has no reason to
[1:58:16] condemn himself for what he approves.
[1:58:18] But he who is uncertain about eating a
[1:58:21] particular thing is condemned if he eats
[1:58:22] because he is not acting from faith.
[1:58:24] Whatever is not from faith is sin.
[1:58:26] Whatever is done with doubt is sinful.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; It's good mature teaching. Now I they
[1:58:32] didn't have this up but let me go on
[1:58:34] chapter 15. If you'd follow me in your
[1:58:36] Bibles chapter 15 and verse I'm in
[1:58:40] another chapter now. Chapter 15 verse1
[1:58:41] 15. He goes on to say, "Now we who are
[1:58:44] strong in our convictions of faith ought
[1:58:46] to patiently put up with the weakness of
[1:58:48] those who are not strong and not just
[1:58:51] please ourselves.
[1:58:54] Let each one of us make it a practice to
[1:58:56] please his neighbor for good, to build
[1:58:57] him up spiritually. For even Christ did
[1:58:59] not please himself, but as is written in
[1:59:02] scripture, the reproaches of those who
[1:59:04] reproached you, the father fell on me,
[1:59:06] the son."
[1:59:09] You know, us parents bear the reproach
[1:59:11] of our children sometimes
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; when they're weward and they go off
[1:59:17] track and all that. It's embarrassing.
[1:59:21] But Christ bore our reproach.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; Christ bore our reproach. So when we
[1:59:30] have a weak saint that hasn't grown in
[1:59:33] certain areas,
[1:59:35] we bear that. We bear the infirmities of
[1:59:38] the weak until they're strong.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; Verse four, for whatever was written in
[1:59:46] earlier times was written for our
[1:59:48] instruction, so that through endurance
[1:59:49] and the encouragement of the scriptures,
[1:59:50] we might have hope and overflow with
[1:59:52] confidence in his promises. Now may the
[1:59:54] God who gives endurance and who supplies
[1:59:56] encouragement grant that you be of the
[1:59:59] same mind with one another according to
[2:00:00] Christ Jesus so that with one accord you
[2:00:04] may have one voice glorify and praise
[2:00:07] honor the God and the father of our Lord
[2:00:09] Jesus Christ. Therefore, continue to
[2:00:13] accept and welcome one another
[2:00:18] just as Christ has accepted and welcomed
[2:00:22] us
[2:00:24] to his glory.
[2:00:28] Last quote.
[2:00:36] It's a question that was asked brother
[2:00:38] Brandham
[2:00:40] in the first Corinthians verse 34. It
[2:00:42] says, "Let your women keep silent in the
[2:00:43] churches for it is not permitted unto
[2:00:45] them to speak. For it is a shame for a
[2:00:47] woman to speak in church. Now if a woman
[2:00:49] with short hair speaks in tongues in
[2:00:52] churches in church, it is the spirit of
[2:00:54] the Holy Ghost that speaks through her.
[2:00:55] or is it a false spirit?
[2:01:00] This is a real hard question
[2:01:03] and I can only answer it the best way
[2:01:05] that I know how. See now, I could not
[2:01:07] judge because I was not sent to judge.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; I want you all to be listening for this
[2:01:14] the instruction here
[2:01:17] to our lives.
[2:01:20] There's matters that have to be handled,
[2:01:23] but they have to be handled with love
[2:01:26] and maturity.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; And I believe these things teach this. I
[2:01:32] could not judge because I was not sent
[2:01:33] to judge. But if a person is speaking in
[2:01:35] tongues, they are anointed of God. You
[2:01:37] see, they may be out of order. That may
[2:01:40] be true. And they may be doing something
[2:01:42] that's not right.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; But I wouldn't want to say that it
[2:01:46] wasn't the Holy Spirit.
[2:01:53] because I wouldn't know. You see, and
[2:01:54] now and that's a that's a man of God
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; saying I wouldn't know. Look at the
[2:01:59] maturity.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; In other words, he's saying if God
[2:02:02] hasn't shown me something and I don't
[2:02:04] know, then I'm not going to act on it.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to call it something right
[2:02:09] away. Now, in his preaching, did he
[2:02:11] preach it strong? Yes. But we're not
[2:02:13] talking about we're talking about a a
[2:02:16] question that was asked. How do I handle
[2:02:18] this situation? He's teaching us how to
[2:02:20] handle it with maturity.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; But did he preach that person can be
[2:02:24] anointed? Did he preach against a woman
[2:02:26] wearing the wrong thing? Did he preach
[2:02:28] first Corinthians 7 and 11? Did he
[2:02:30] preach? Yes. And the church has got away
[2:02:33] from it. But it's Bible nonetheless.
[2:02:37] And now there's many times that people
[2:02:39] misjudge one another. Oh boy. Can you
[2:02:41] say amen to that? There's many times
[2:02:43] that people misjudge one. I'm aware of
[2:02:45] the time
[2:02:47] It's still cold outside.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; And now there's many times that people
[2:02:54] misjudge one another. And it is a bad
[2:02:56] thing to do. You say, "Well, she's got
[2:02:59] short hair. She's wearing her dresses
[2:03:01] too short. That's not the Holy Spirit
[2:03:03] upon her." Don't do that.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; Don't do that. That's not right.
[2:03:11] You don't know what's in that woman's
[2:03:13] heart.
[2:03:15] That's right.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; You don't know nothing about it.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; Sure puts us in our place.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; You don't know. You think you know, but
[2:03:24] you don't really know.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; You know that the Holy Spirit would make
[2:03:29] her conduct herself a little better. We
[2:03:31] know that. That may that may be true.
[2:03:33] But I'll tell you as you and I let God
[2:03:36] do the judging of that. and lets you and
[2:03:39] I just pray for that person that God
[2:03:42] will show them the light. That's
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; right.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; Here's some time ago, a man met me out
[2:03:48] here outside and I had a pianist here
[2:03:50] that had a little short little skirt and
[2:03:53] it wasn't exactly I guess just right and
[2:03:56] the lady had short hair and she was just
[2:03:59] a babe in this way and she was playing
[2:04:01] the piano.
[2:04:05] It's real quiet right now.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; And a man met me out there and just
[2:04:10] tearing me to pieces. He said, "And
[2:04:12] you're a Pentecostal preacher." And let
[2:04:14] that woman set up there that short hair
[2:04:17] and just going on like that. You know
[2:04:19] what? No. Like, why is this guy being
[2:04:21] rough in this? Because early Pentecost,
[2:04:23] the women didn't do that.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; Matter of fact, in our country early on,
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; there was a difference. And women didn't
[2:04:31] do that.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; Now it's a common thing. Now it's, you
[2:04:34] know, so so that's why and then the
[2:04:36] Pentecostal realms for sure it was not
[2:04:39] allowed. You know, it's because they
[2:04:41] knew the scripture on it. We've gotten
[2:04:42] way far away from that. And he's right,
[2:04:44] you're a Pentecostal preacher. Let the
[2:04:45] woman set up there that short here and
[2:04:47] just going on like everything. Well, I
[2:04:49] said, I think the woman has a good
[2:04:51] spirit in her.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; I certainly do not agree with that. You
[2:04:56] know, the skirt part up here and the two
[2:04:59] pieces, one of them is down here and one
[2:05:01] of kind. It's a skirt like they wear and
[2:05:04] it's so real thin and shows that
[2:05:07] underneath garment that they have around
[2:05:09] there. He's being pretty descriptive.
[2:05:12] This is a bit immodest.
[2:05:14] Hello everybody.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; A reminder to all of you.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; Don't wear something you can see
[2:05:20] through. Sisters,
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; that's not modest.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; Skirt like that where and so it's real
[2:05:27] thin and shows underneath garment. They
[2:05:28] shave around. I don't think that should
[2:05:30] I don't think that should be done. I
[2:05:32] don't like that. I don't I really don't.
[2:05:35] They they might be just as spiritfilled
[2:05:37] as anybody. I don't know. God knows
[2:05:39] that.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; But I wouldn't condemn that woman and
[2:05:42] say that she was going to hell
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; by the sight.
[2:05:49] This same person had in his church a
[2:05:53] lady who had long hair and wore long
[2:05:56] dresses and had a temper enough to fight
[2:05:59] a buzzsaw
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; and just as mean as she could be.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; She's wearing everything right on the
[2:06:12] outside, but oh, she had problems on the
[2:06:14] inside. She probably thought she was
[2:06:16] more spiritual than everybody. But I'm
[2:06:18] telling you, I'm talking about things
[2:06:20] not on the outside that make you
[2:06:21] spiritual. I'm talking about character.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about something deeper.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about adoption, maturity.
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about submission.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; Not to a church form. Submission to
[2:06:35] Christ the word because you want to.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; She had enough temper to fight a B just
[2:06:40] as me. Now, long hair and long skirts
[2:06:43] don't take you to heaven. That's right.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; Long hair, long hair and long shirts
[2:06:52] don't take you to heaven. No, sir. It's
[2:06:54] the spirit that takes you
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; to heaven.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; Now, you see, let me say something as a
[2:07:00] pastor here.
[2:07:05] What happens when you read that for
[2:07:07] especially young girls, they take it as
[2:07:10] an endorsement
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; and they're going to go wear what they
[2:07:14] want to wear and nobody better say
[2:07:16] something about me because brother Paul
[2:07:18] read the quote.
[2:07:21] And so I have the awkward position of
[2:07:23] reading these things. There's a there's
[2:07:25] a quote about makeup that uh talks about
[2:07:28] if you have you don't have any color in
[2:07:30] your face and maybe you need a little
[2:07:31] color, but you shouldn't be painted up
[2:07:33] like a barn. That's not a good idea.
[2:07:35] That's there's scripture that talks
[2:07:37] about that. And also just it's the world
[2:07:39] says it's pretty. God says it's not
[2:07:42] natural. The way God made you is pretty.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; Character is pretty.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; But I'm in that awkward position. If I
[2:07:48] read this a lot then then usually now I
[2:07:51] don't understand why 50 year old women
[2:07:53] or 30-y old women take those quotes and
[2:07:55] say I'm going with it. I'm going to wear
[2:07:57] what I want. I don't understand that. I
[2:07:58] can understand someone who's just trying
[2:08:00] to get their footing. But nevertheless,
[2:08:01] we got to have a grace for everybody. We
[2:08:04] got to have understanding. There's
[2:08:06] there's some reason. It could be
[2:08:07] rebellion, but it it could be they
[2:08:09] haven't found their identity in the word
[2:08:11] yet. I completely I don't know. But we
[2:08:13] just got to have that, you know, bear
[2:08:15] with the weak until they're strong in
[2:08:17] that area.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; Can I say can you say amen?
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; So, and and you know, uh anyway, you
[2:08:23] know, that's that's the position that
[2:08:25] we're in sometimes. I haven't read that
[2:08:27] quote a lot because it just becomes and
[2:08:30] that's sad that it becomes an
[2:08:31] endorsement. Okay, I'm taking that one
[2:08:33] thing.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; And then you got 30 other 40 other
[2:08:37] quotes that just are correcting the
[2:08:41] Jezebels of this generation.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; Then you cake that on and it shows
[2:08:46] you're empty inside.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; Oh boy. But the pastor, listen now, then
[2:08:52] you should remember that many times
[2:08:54] pastors don't mention those things.
[2:08:55] Well, look at that. I hear I'm reading
[2:08:56] it. Here I am doing it. Pastors don't
[2:09:00] mention those things. And people just
[2:09:01] automatically go on think it's all
[2:09:04] right. But a pastor should really tear
[2:09:06] into that. And then the sisters of the
[2:09:09] church, those sisters who are in
[2:09:10] character standing, wearing their
[2:09:11] clothes neatly, they should be examples
[2:09:13] of sweetness and motherly and sisterly
[2:09:16] like. And I think that any woman that's
[2:09:18] motherly and godly and sister ought to
[2:09:19] go to such a person, this girl on the
[2:09:22] piano, and with sweetness of spirit,
[2:09:25] just sit down and talk to that lady. And
[2:09:27] if she is of God, the Holy Spirit will
[2:09:30] understand those things and she'll
[2:09:33] correct herself.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; But when the real when when you really
[2:09:39] quickly condemn her and drive her away,
[2:09:42] you might harm that young baby. You see?
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; So I wouldn't condemn that person.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; You know what he's talking about?
[2:09:53] Handling matters amongst yourself,
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; not acting too quickly in your opinion.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; Does it need to be corrected? Yes, it
[2:10:03] does. But how does it get corrected?
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; That's maturity.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Kenny, musicians, come or I'll just keep
[2:10:12] preaching and preaching and teaching and
[2:10:14] keeping going on this. It's a never-
[2:10:15] ending subject. Does everybody recognize
[2:10:18] today how much our Lord loves us for
[2:10:20] these quotes and these scriptures and
[2:10:22] where he wants to take us
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; in his word?
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; And the divide in congregations most the
[2:10:31] time
[2:10:33] these days is not over big things, it's
[2:10:36] over little things.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; And we let the devil continue to divide
[2:10:40] that way. Every person should pray about
[2:10:44] where they belong. Every person should
[2:10:46] pray about where they stand in the word.
[2:10:48] Every person should know, as Paul
[2:10:50] mentioned, be fully persuaded in his own
[2:10:52] mind. And I believe that fully persuaded
[2:10:54] comes from knowing your place and your
[2:10:56] word based and you're not opinion-based.
[2:10:59] You have a right to your own opinion,
[2:11:00] but they should always be submissive to
[2:11:02] the word. And when we take our opinions
[2:11:05] and we begin to lift them and make them
[2:11:07] cause for dispute and arguments and then
[2:11:10] get in that little detail, but how long
[2:11:12] should that be? in. How long should that
[2:11:15] screw? Every time we go there, we bind
[2:11:17] things up and it brings division.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; There's a greater work that's working
[2:11:21] among the people of God.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; It's greater than pastors. It's greater
[2:11:25] than deacons. It's greater than you.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost in us.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; Does he know how to run a church? Yes,
[2:11:33] he does.
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; Does he know how to correct things? Yes,
[2:11:36] he does. So, we're sensitive to the Holy
[2:11:39] Spirit to correct things as God gives
[2:11:43] the leadership to do it. And in this
[2:11:44] case, he's guiding that a a sweet sister
[2:11:48] coming in the right way to bring the
[2:11:49] correction would have more of an effect
[2:11:52] than that guy who's yelling,
[2:11:55] "Get it taken care of. Take her up." You
[2:11:58] know, I know it's the wrong attitude.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; The wrong attitude is taught. The wrong
[2:12:03] attitude has caused a lot of divide
[2:12:05] within the body of Christ. Listen, we
[2:12:08] are, how many would raise your hand to
[2:12:10] our country? You know,
[2:12:13] our country right now is divided more
[2:12:15] than it's ever been.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; And I don't know if it's going to end
[2:12:20] until the Superman, the Antichrist,
[2:12:22] comes on the scene to bring it all
[2:12:24] together.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; But right now, it's it's so divided
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; and there's wrong on both sides.
[2:12:33] Can you say amen?
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; I don't believe somebody should flaunt
[2:12:37] their rebellion towards the law who's
[2:12:40] trying to keep the law,
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; but I don't agree with I hate that a
[2:12:45] woman had to die over that and get shot.
[2:12:49] I don't think necessarily that would be
[2:12:51] balanced either. I'm not choosing either
[2:12:52] side, but it just shows the divide in
[2:12:55] this country. If that spirit is
[2:12:58] everywhere
[2:12:59] and and permeates this nation and
[2:13:02] churches and organizations,
[2:13:05] then we ought to rise to our feet.
[2:13:08] Let the church of God arise. Gideon sang
[2:13:11] it. Let the worshippers arise and say,
[2:13:14] "Lord,
[2:13:16] the world can be divided,
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; but God, don't let the body of Christ be
[2:13:20] divided.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; Let us run towards each other in love.
[2:13:26] except receive as Paul said. Doesn't
[2:13:30] mean we're compromising, but we're
[2:13:31] giving time for people to grow.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; Maybe they don't have a problem with a
[2:13:38] little bit immodest dress. Maybe they
[2:13:40] got a temper and they hide it.
[2:13:43] He needs to get rid of that temper.
[2:13:44] Yeah, he does. You better bring it to
[2:13:46] God. It's going to damage his family,
[2:13:48] his marriage.
[2:13:50] But that's only one of hundreds of
[2:13:52] things
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; that can be laying there that God's got
[2:13:55] to deal with.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; If you sit still in front of the Lord
[2:14:00] and you just be patient, God will deal
[2:14:04] with every thing that's not right.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; That's right. in his own way.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; I've got a 100% confidence the
[2:14:13] leadership that we're under will deal
[2:14:15] with your lives because he knows you
[2:14:18] better than I do.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; He knows your background. He knows your
[2:14:21] pride. Whatever it is, if you sit still,
[2:14:23] and that's why, you know, Brother Brent
[2:14:25] says that the bride can just sit still
[2:14:27] long enough.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; And I've made you do it for two hours
[2:14:31] today, hour and a half. If we can just
[2:14:33] sit still, just trust, just let him do
[2:14:36] the work. Everything that's not
[2:14:38] perfectly right, he'll bring it right.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; Bind us together.
[2:14:47] Key of probably
[2:14:50] bind us.
[2:14:52] Let's stand together.
[2:14:55] Bind us together
[2:14:58] with cords.
[2:15:00] [Music]
[2:15:06] Jesus, bind us,
[2:15:09] [Music]
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; Lord. Bind us.
[2:15:17] Bind us
[2:15:19] together.
[2:15:24] Jesus, bind us together.
[2:15:30] Lord bind us
[2:15:33] together
[2:15:34] with bord
[2:15:38] cannot be broken.
[2:15:44] Jesus bind us.
[2:15:49] Bind us together,
[2:15:53] Lord. Bind us
[2:15:56] together
[2:15:57] in
[2:16:01] there is only one God. Oh, there
[2:16:04] is only
[2:16:07] one God.
[2:16:10] [Music]
[2:16:12] There
[2:16:14] is only
[2:16:17] one king.
[2:16:19] [Music]
[2:16:21] There
[2:16:23] is only
[2:16:25] one body. One body.
[2:16:28] [Music]
[2:16:30] That is what
[2:16:34] I see. One more time. Bind us together.
[2:16:38] Jesus. find us.
[2:16:44] [Music]
[2:16:49] Oh,
[2:16:51] can I be broken?
[2:16:55] [Music]
[2:16:58] Bind us
[2:17:00] together, Lord. Bind us.
[2:17:07] find us
[2:17:10] ever.
[2:17:11] [Music]
[2:17:15] Can we pray together now? Just lift your
[2:17:17] hand and say, "I don't want to do
[2:17:19] anything that offends.
[2:17:24] I don't want to live a life that sends a
[2:17:26] message out there and I live something
[2:17:28] different at the church. I don't want to
[2:17:29] live a double life because it would
[2:17:32] cause some young girl, some young young
[2:17:34] girl to stumble at that if I'm putting
[2:17:37] up something as a post on my social
[2:17:39] media that's a different life than what
[2:17:41] I'm doing at church. That's I don't want
[2:17:43] to do that. I don't want to lift my
[2:17:46] personal
[2:17:48] likes and dislikes and personal opinions
[2:17:51] to rise to a place that causes fusses
[2:17:55] amongst the people.
[2:17:57] [Music]
[2:17:59] But I want to be, as Paul said, the goal
[2:18:02] is to be in one mind, one accord of the
[2:18:05] same mind that we all speak the same
[2:18:08] thing. It's not so much we speak of the
[2:18:10] same in opinions, but we're speaking the
[2:18:12] same character that Christ has exampled
[2:18:16] to us and taught us.
[2:18:19] That's what we want to speak is the same
[2:18:21] thing. The word of God this generation,
[2:18:24] I don't want to step out of that and
[2:18:26] separate myself. say, "I'm my own body
[2:18:28] of Christ. I do my own thing." No. No.
[2:18:30] We are part of We're submissive to one
[2:18:32] another. We're we're submissive to the
[2:18:35] word, but we're also submissive to the
[2:18:38] the body of Christ that we all find that
[2:18:43] one mind and one accord. What could God
[2:18:45] do if we continue to find that? So once
[2:18:48] again, just raise your hand, say, "Pray
[2:18:50] for me, Brother Paul."
[2:18:53] that that real deep true pure submission
[2:18:56] would be there to give all of my life
[2:18:59] and character and my home life,
[2:19:02] everything yielded to him to find the
[2:19:05] right balance in my life and that I
[2:19:08] could be a light even as the prophet was
[2:19:11] saying Lord to to be some sister sweetly
[2:19:15] coming to that girl and being a light to
[2:19:17] her even in those situations we want to
[2:19:20] be a light. Lord, bless everyone that's
[2:19:24] heard this long service today. Lord, I
[2:19:27] pray that it would help us, that would
[2:19:29] strengthen us that was take a step
[2:19:32] forward, Lord, to the things that you're
[2:19:35] calling us more and more to. That
[2:19:37] church, that Ephesian church
[2:19:40] has all the word with it and all the
[2:19:43] truths and how you've called us from the
[2:19:46] foundation of the world, but yet Lord
[2:19:49] has maturity and the gifts and working
[2:19:51] with one another as a body.
[2:19:55] Lord, we believe Calvar's purchased it
[2:19:58] all. We want to take all of that, take
[2:20:00] us and bind us together by the Holy
[2:20:03] Ghost this morning, Lord. Let every
[2:20:06] selfish motive
[2:20:08] be laid aside.
[2:20:12] You know what? I've prayed for my own
[2:20:13] life this year coming year. Lord, take
[2:20:17] me on that journey, Lord, to know you
[2:20:20] more than I've ever known you before. I
[2:20:23] pray,
[2:20:25] committing each life to you now in Jesus
[2:20:28] name. Oh, I want to know you more.
[2:20:34] deep within my soul. I want to know,
[2:20:41] oh, I want to know you.
[2:20:45] I to feel your heart and know your mind.
[2:20:52] Looking in your eyes
[2:20:55] within me.
[2:20:58] eyes that say, "I want
[2:21:02] to know."
[2:21:07] Oh, I want to know you.
[2:21:13] Before we are dismissed today, could you
[2:21:14] just turn to somebody say, "I want to
[2:21:16] know him more." Pray for me. Pray for
[2:21:18] me, brother, sister, that I know our my
[2:21:21] Lord more than I've ever known him
[2:21:23] before. deep within my soul.
[2:21:27] I want to know him more.
[2:21:29] [Music]
[2:21:31] This light shining through me.
[2:21:34] God bless you as you're dismissed this
[2:21:36] morning. Thank you for giving me time.
[2:21:38] And
[2:21:40] I know it's extra time today, but it's
[2:21:42] been a joy to be in his house. If you
[2:21:43] have to be dismissed, get in, you can
[2:21:45] come and lead some songs. I love you all
[2:21:48] so much. If you need prayer for a need,
[2:21:51] this is the body of Christ. Come, come
[2:21:53] and we'll take it before the Lord. Amen.
[2:21:56] Oh,
[2:21:58] I want to know. Yes, Lord.
[2:22:02] Oh, deep within my soul. Yes, Lord, I
[2:22:07] want to know you.
[2:22:12] To feel
[2:22:14] your heart and know your mind.
[2:22:19] Looking in your eyes,
[2:22:22] [Music]
[2:22:29] know
[2:22:31] you.
[2:22:33] Oh, I want to know you. Oh. Can we sing
[2:22:38] it one more time? Oh, I want to know
[2:22:40] you.
[2:22:45] &gt;&gt; Oh God, bind us together, Lord. It's
[2:22:47] your people.
[2:22:50] Make us one with you, Lord. Make us one
[2:22:52] with you, Lord.
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; Deeper than we ever did before.
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; Fill your heart,

[2:23:05] mind of Christ.

[2:23:13] you will for me.

[2:23:29] you.

[2:23:31] &gt;&gt; Deep within my soul, I want to know.
[2:23:38] Oh, I want to know you. Feel
[2:23:43] your heart and know your mind.
[2:23:48] Looking in your eyes up within
[2:23:54] Christ, let's say I want to know
[2:24:00] you.
[2:24:02] Oh, I want to know you more.
[2:24:08] [Music]

[2:25:11] Oh,
[2:25:13] oh, the lamb was slain
[2:25:17] before the earth was laid.
[2:25:22] What an awesome price he paid.
