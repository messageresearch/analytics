[6:08] every
[6:11] time
[6:18] [Music]
[6:25] Jesus in the streets
[6:28] Jesus said in the darkness
[6:34] this is a small my family I speak the
[6:39] whole name Jesus
[6:42] [Music]
[6:48] Jesus
[6:53] [Music]
[7:01] Jesus Jesus
[7:07] [Music]
[7:20] for he shall be as a tree planted By the
[7:23] Waters and that spreadeth out her Roots
[7:26] by the river and shall not see when he
[7:29] cometh but her Leaf shall be green and
[7:32] shall not be careful in the year of
[7:34] drought neither shall cease from
[7:37] yielding fruit so these scriptures are
[7:40] not just little
[7:42] um Sunday school scriptures but they're
[7:44] actually foretelling and speaking of the
[7:46] Believers particularly of the last day
[7:48] who are thriving and are planted in the
[7:51] right place and that are that are chosen
[7:54] and predestinated to walk in the word
[7:57] and become adopted Sons and Daughters of
[7:58] God and when they're planted in the
[8:00] right place then they have all these
[8:02] characteristics and I wanted to read it
[8:04] again because I was amazed how much it
[8:06] just elaborated a little bit more than
[8:08] Psalms 1 and I want you to read again it
[8:11] says for he verse 8 shall be as a tree
[8:13] planted By the Waters and that spreadth
[8:15] out her Roots by the river and that's
[8:18] what we talked about Sunday
[8:19] and shall not see when he cometh but her
[8:23] Leaf shall be green and shall not be
[8:24] careful in the year of drought neither
[8:26] shall cease from yielding fruit so it's
[8:28] just it just elaborates just a little
[8:30] bit more on what the scripture says in
[8:32] Psalms 1 and so his roots are have gone
[8:35] down close to the river The Roots
[8:37] receive constant moisture from the river
[8:39] and the water and it seems it just it
[8:42] gives more details and I read it today
[8:45] in the Amplified I was going to read
[8:47] that to you as well this way this is the
[8:49] way verse 8 is read in the Amplified for
[8:52] he will be nourished like a tree planted
[8:55] By the Waters that spreads out its roots
[8:58] by the river and will not fear the heat
[9:01] when it comes but its leaves will be
[9:05] green and moist and it will not be
[9:08] anxious and concerned in the year of
[9:11] drought nor stop bearing fruit if you're
[9:15] planted close to the water and receiving
[9:17] that Life Source then you're not living
[9:20] a life of worry that you're not worried
[9:23] about a drought this tree is not worried
[9:25] about a drought coming because he
[9:27] doesn't have to worry about a drought
[9:29] he's not dependent upon those Reigns and
[9:31] we'll just get into that in just a
[9:32] minute but his leaves are green and
[9:34] moist and he will not fear the heat when
[9:36] it comes so this is a just amazing how
[9:40] this just is manifested in such a way or
[9:43] brought to us in such a word picture in
[9:45] such a revelation to show us and it
[9:47] should tell us this is where I want to
[9:49] live
[9:50] this is where I want to be
[9:52] this is God speaking of the Holy
[9:54] ghost-filled Christian
[9:56] this is where and when he's planted in
[9:58] the right place this is the fruit that
[10:00] comes from his life and it certainly is
[10:03] taking away our fears it certainly is
[10:05] taking away our worries can you say Amen
[10:08] and so um you know when we speak of
[10:11] they're just that part about no fear or
[10:14] no worry it's just not there in this
[10:16] tree even when no rain is on the outside
[10:19] and the rain in the Bible say it's rain
[10:22] types blessings
[10:24] rain types blessings so this Christian
[10:27] is not dependent on the blessings of the
[10:31] Lord
[10:32] we enjoy the blessings of the Lord
[10:35] but we don't live on the blessings of
[10:37] the Lord are are moisture and are are
[10:41] thriving and our growth comes from
[10:44] something deeper because we know the
[10:46] rains can be there but then the rains
[10:48] can stop
[10:49] and sometimes in our life the rain can
[10:53] stop for a long time and that's called a
[10:55] drought
[10:56] and so if this tree was dependent upon
[10:59] that reign of blessings then it would
[11:01] give out in the drought it would be
[11:03] nervous it would become anxious it would
[11:05] begin to die but because it's not
[11:07] dependent on the blessings of the Lord
[11:09] and because blessings we can in life we
[11:12] can have we can have things that we
[11:14] think as the blessings of God but
[11:16] sometimes our trials can be blessings in
[11:19] disguise
[11:20] and sometimes when we have a drought if
[11:22] we're rooted in the Lord the drought can
[11:25] be a good time to grow as well
[11:27] only in this type of tree now can you
[11:29] say man a tree that's got its roots way
[11:31] down is that we find in a drought
[11:33] sometimes you're through trials and wins
[11:36] and the things that happen on the
[11:38] outside back to you those things can
[11:41] actually be when your roots are dead
[11:42] actually it can make your roots go
[11:44] deeper
[11:46] so what a wonderful thing to see that
[11:48] but people actually depend people live
[11:51] dependent on the blessings of God uh is
[11:54] everything and when everything is right
[11:56] in their life and when the rain is
[11:58] falling and when everything is good then
[12:01] they're happy
[12:03] when everything's working out all right
[12:05] then they can be happy it when
[12:09] everything is just coming together just
[12:11] so well and lining up so well and that's
[12:13] the times we thank God it's just all
[12:15] lining up good and we're happy about it
[12:17] and we thank God for it and we shouldn't
[12:19] do that but see growth in the Lord
[12:20] maturity in the Lord is that when that's
[12:23] not lining up just right and we don't
[12:25] understand why it's not lining up we
[12:27] still are rooted by the tree the tree is
[12:29] rooted by the rivers of water it's not
[12:31] like we're going to die from that it's
[12:33] not like we're losing our joy from that
[12:35] because we know during those times we're
[12:37] a predestinated Son of God anyway God's
[12:40] going to direct us anyway God is going
[12:42] to keep us anyway
[12:44] and so uh people live dependent on the
[12:47] blessings of the Lord and I'm not
[12:48] against the blessing I love the
[12:50] blessings of God but a lot of times it's
[12:52] what we view as blessings
[12:55] it's what we view as God's blessings and
[12:58] a lot of times blessings we view it is
[13:00] if things are just going well and coming
[13:02] in line and perfect
[13:05] can you say man
[13:07] so we have to really become a deeper
[13:09] Christian to realize what is God's
[13:11] blessings because we look at it that we
[13:13] got a lot of money and we got all the
[13:14] money to pay bills and we look at it as
[13:17] far as Financial price prosperity and it
[13:20] is sometimes
[13:23] sometimes we can be just as blessed
[13:26] spiritually and not have a dime to our
[13:29] name
[13:30] we can't view all of our spirituality
[13:32] where we stand with the Lord on just
[13:34] finances we can't view it just as that
[13:36] we can't see I'm blessed if that's
[13:37] happening and I'm not blessed we can't
[13:39] view it carnally like that because we
[13:42] realize God he can prosper us but the
[13:45] most important Prosperity we receive as
[13:48] a Believer is where we're at spiritually
[13:51] and if we lose sight of that we'll view
[13:53] his Blessings by natural carnal things
[13:57] are we listening tonight
[14:00] so then I can be if everything's going
[14:02] right then I'll serve the Lord that's
[14:04] how some people feel about it if I feel
[14:07] good then I'll go to church you think
[14:09] that you think that's not true people go
[14:12] to church if they feel if everything's
[14:14] happened good for the week and they feel
[14:16] good and they're feeling healthy
[14:19] then we're going to be at church it's
[14:22] it's about feelings it's about emotions
[14:25] if everything's going good with my job
[14:27] then I'll come and sing and open my
[14:29] heart and Worship the Lord you really
[14:32] should come and worship with more
[14:34] strength towards the Lord when you lose
[14:36] your job
[14:39] see this is Counter Culture isn't it
[14:42] I won't be there tonight brother Paul I
[14:44] lost my job and if I lost my job I'll
[14:46] probably lose everything and I don't
[14:48] know where this is going to go so I
[14:49] won't be there I didn't I just don't
[14:51] even feel like worshiping now you might
[14:53] cut chuckle at that that's the type of
[14:55] conversations in 30 years of pastoring
[14:57] I've had that sometime
[14:59] and sometimes I have to bite my tongue
[15:01] to not say it and correct it and say no
[15:03] if you've gone through this or if you
[15:05] lost a loved one or you're going through
[15:07] a depressing time the very Place best
[15:09] place you could be is in the presence of
[15:11] the Lord you're letting Satan rob you of
[15:14] what you really should be doing that's
[15:16] the times we call out on God that's the
[15:19] time job says you know what I don't have
[15:21] a clue what's going on and my wife's
[15:23] telling me to curse God and die but I'm
[15:25] going to go to church and I'm going to
[15:27] worship and I can you say man I'm a
[15:30] little bit angry here but I'm not gonna
[15:32] stop my worship before God because the
[15:35] lord giveth and the lord taketh away
[15:37] blessed be the name of the Lord
[15:40] that's the time to Worship the Lord
[15:42] but we can't view His blessings as then
[15:45] the things that come from the outside
[15:47] and this tree is basically saying this
[15:50] believer is saying that I am not afraid
[15:53] of a drought in my life because I am not
[15:56] dependent on the moisture of those rains
[15:58] I'm dependent on the moisture coming
[16:00] from the river the drought hits
[16:03] and there's no blessings
[16:06] and
[16:08] if there's rain in our life it's all
[16:10] good but you see if the drought hits
[16:12] that's when a drought can be a real test
[16:14] it can bring worry if you're dependent
[16:17] on those blessings and this tree is not
[16:19] worried about a drought if it rains or
[16:21] if it doesn't I'm good
[16:23] why because he's planted by the source
[16:26] of moisture it's not that it comes from
[16:28] the top
[16:29] but the roots are way down deep
[16:32] connected to the moisture of the river
[16:34] if there if there's money if there's no
[16:37] money
[16:38] we pray we worship God
[16:41] amen
[16:43] if people treat me right or people treat
[16:46] me wrong we serve God we worship God if
[16:50] I'm in pain or I'm not in pain it
[16:53] doesn't change my worship before the
[16:54] Lord if the job ends or if they like me
[16:57] a lot at work it doesn't matter it
[16:59] doesn't waver can you say Amen because
[17:01] I'm not looking to the outside things
[17:03] going good or going bad can you say man
[17:06] I'm not dependent on that and that's not
[17:09] dictating my joy
[17:13] I say that because for all of us we
[17:17] might as well admit that things of Life
[17:20] affect and take away our joy and we
[17:24] should never let outside rain or not
[17:27] rain or whatever take away our joy don't
[17:30] let nobody steal your joy
[17:33] don't let anything steal your joy
[17:36] you say well I lost a no you still got
[17:38] it but you're just letting it being
[17:39] clouded over by thinking something was
[17:42] going to go this certain way I thought
[17:44] the job was gonna I thought it was going
[17:46] to go this way and so I'm just not happy
[17:48] and and you know you you can say with
[17:51] trying to be careful not to offend
[17:53] tonight you can can say it's very much
[17:55] like a little baby who's only happy when
[17:58] it gets what it what it wants
[18:01] and when it doesn't get when a
[18:03] two-year-old does not get what she wants
[18:06] she can turn on you pretty quick he can
[18:08] turn on you pretty quick
[18:10] I mean I just I I get in trouble so I
[18:13] gave Ellie a sucker where's she at she
[18:16] gone
[18:17] I gave her a sucker in the office
[18:19] because when we left from the house I
[18:21] had to take her to church tonight and we
[18:23] had to get in the truck so the sucker
[18:25] had to be taken away so this smiley girl
[18:27] had it taken away and she changed to a
[18:30] different countenance
[18:34] and so then I thought well let's give it
[18:37] back we got in the office I gave her
[18:39] another one and then that had to be
[18:41] taken away from her but it's kind of
[18:43] funny to watch because this is Christian
[18:44] sometimes
[18:47] this is Christian sometimes these are
[18:49] baby Christians and they can change in a
[18:52] moment they're so happy and so smiling
[18:55] and something changes in their life
[18:56] somebody doesn't treat them well
[18:58] somebody posted something that they
[18:59] didn't like and in a moment's time
[19:02] they're counting has changed and they
[19:03] become this different person that's baby
[19:05] Hood
[19:06] that's a baby Christian
[19:09] we let things affect our emotions so
[19:12] much family problems and family issues
[19:15] and and marriage issues and God is
[19:18] looking for that consistent being
[19:20] planted staying filled with the word of
[19:22] God staying with our mind on the word of
[19:24] God so that just doesn't bump us around
[19:26] as much and we're not dependent on the
[19:28] blessings or if the drought comes we're
[19:31] still receiving the from the source
[19:35] we have a source and if we're connected
[19:38] to it it never ends
[19:40] never gives up so now you know that even
[19:43] a good plan as we talked about Sunday
[19:45] we're talking about the tree plant you
[19:48] know that even a good plant taken away
[19:50] from water or not getting water can
[19:53] start withering can start getting sticky
[19:56] can start getting brown leaves instead
[19:58] of as it speaks in scripture here of a
[20:00] flourishing a leaf being green we know
[20:03] that a plant can get dried up we know a
[20:06] plant can become ugly when it was
[20:08] beautiful before we know a plant can get
[20:10] hard instead of soft instead of gentle
[20:13] the petals can become they're gentle but
[20:16] they can become hard and it's all
[20:18] because of a lack of water if that's
[20:21] true in the natural it's true in the
[20:22] spiritual
[20:23] can be shriveled up it could be it can
[20:26] be closed and look dead and be
[20:29] eventually become dead and so I I think
[20:32] sometimes we can see pretty good when a
[20:35] person is not near the Water of Life
[20:39] I think it becomes pretty quickly
[20:41] evident when someone is not planted
[20:44] close to the rivers of Living Water
[20:47] there's a clear evidence of someone
[20:49] being distant from the spirit and from
[20:52] the word and feeding out other things
[20:55] I'm going to say it again it becomes
[20:57] pretty quickly evident in our if it does
[21:00] for a plant like some of our plants
[21:02] within just a few days you can see them
[21:04] shrivel up and they've got brown edges
[21:07] on some of the petals and that's for
[21:09] lack of water sometimes if that happens
[21:11] in the natural that's what happens to
[21:13] your life in the spiritual and it
[21:15] becomes real clear in your life in my
[21:17] life is that when we get a little bit
[21:19] too far away from the Waters of life
[21:22] then we start to have these
[21:24] characteristics sometimes to show that
[21:27] we're distant from the word we're
[21:29] distant from uh from the spirit of God
[21:31] and we're feeding on other things
[21:34] usually you can tell what a person is
[21:36] feeding on
[21:39] it shows up in the attitude it shows up
[21:42] in the reactions
[21:44] hey how you doing I'm fine doing fine
[21:49] leave me alone these these
[21:52] characteristics of getting edgy and
[21:54] bitter and angry and feeling your
[21:58] feelings are sensitive and you're easily
[22:00] offended
[22:02] for a Believer and say well no Believers
[22:05] act like that all right for a Believer
[22:08] it's a direct giveaway that you have
[22:11] become disconnected because you will
[22:14] never get
[22:15] a a a a a pattern of those results
[22:20] you might have an instant moment where
[22:22] you get angry because that's anger's a
[22:23] part of us
[22:25] it's an emotion can you say man remember
[22:27] the Bible says be angry and sin not our
[22:30] emotions can rise up over things even
[22:32] over sin can you say Amen but you see
[22:34] now he says be angry and sin not it's
[22:37] where that anger goes we can have a
[22:39] moment but when we see patterns popping
[22:41] up in a life we know that someone and in
[22:44] our own lives we know that you can never
[22:46] be completely connected and feeding on
[22:49] the word of life and the spirit of life
[22:51] and staying in there every day and have
[22:54] all of these patterns of sensitivity and
[22:57] easily offended and outraged anger and
[23:00] bitterness and being edgy all the time
[23:03] and becoming bitter even towards God
[23:05] there is no way you get that fruit from
[23:09] a person that's connected to the source
[23:11] of life there's no way you get it
[23:14] uh uh doesn't James say that a tree
[23:17] cannot put forth this fruit and that it
[23:19] can't happen it can't bring forth these
[23:22] different things it's not to be so if
[23:24] you're connected to the water of life
[23:25] and you stay connected there are fruits
[23:28] that come from that God told Israel
[23:32] when he received the word when he gave
[23:34] the word to Moses on Mount Sinai that's
[23:36] a very Horeb is where they were in Mount
[23:39] Sinai and the word came to the prophet
[23:40] it was such a pivotal point for Israel
[23:43] and God actually after it happened they
[23:45] received the word to live by he kept
[23:47] pointing them back to that and that was
[23:49] a pivotal point for them but when he
[23:51] talked to them in Deuteronomy 6 which we
[23:52] won't have time to read tonight when he
[23:54] said it said to them when he spoke to
[23:57] them after they'd received the word it
[23:59] wasn't just they received the word and
[24:01] it wasn't just that they would uh that
[24:03] they would have the word but he said now
[24:05] I'm going to warn you when you come into
[24:08] the land the first thing you you should
[24:11] give all of your heart to the word of
[24:13] God and you should meditate upon it day
[24:16] and night you should teach it your to
[24:18] your children you should put it upon the
[24:20] doorpost of your house you should put it
[24:22] upon here you should put it and so so
[24:24] you should become saturated with the
[24:28] word of God they could say well we've
[24:30] got the word from a prophet that's
[24:31] enough but to God it wasn't enough
[24:33] because he says when you get into the
[24:35] promised land a couple things will
[24:37] happen you're going to prosper you're
[24:39] going to have goodly lands and guess
[24:41] what if you keep your eyes on that
[24:43] you're going to forget my precepts
[24:45] you're going to forget me
[24:47] so in order not to forget me this word
[24:49] can't just be on tablets this word has
[24:52] to be in your heart every day
[24:54] do you get it and God's saying that you
[24:57] know teach your children from the time
[24:59] they're young teach your grandchildren
[25:00] get it in front of them post it on the
[25:03] doorpost have the word up everywhere
[25:05] talk about he says talk about it in your
[25:07] home constantly why is God saying this
[25:10] we've got the word from a prophet that's
[25:12] all we need no wasn't all you need
[25:13] you've got to get that word integrated
[25:16] into your life you've got to get that
[25:18] word into your mind you've got to get
[25:19] that word into your soul you've got to
[25:22] get it in your spirit and you've got to
[25:23] keep it in your spirit for two reasons
[25:26] when you prosper you tend to forget God
[25:30] listen God knows Human Nature
[25:32] I said God knows human nature and when
[25:36] people Prosper with blessings they tend
[25:39] to forget
[25:40] the precepts of God
[25:42] so the first reason he says you have to
[25:44] keep it you have to integrate it into
[25:46] your life every day speak about it teach
[25:49] it to your children let it be the
[25:50] Forefront of your thoughts
[25:52] the second reason is he says so that you
[25:55] won't be overtaken with Idols because
[25:56] when your heart gets distant and when
[25:58] your heart is away from the word you're
[26:00] more susceptible to idol worship
[26:04] and then God says I am one Lord and I
[26:07] want you to be single in your worship
[26:09] towards me that heart believes belongs
[26:12] to me and he says I want you to serve me
[26:14] with all your heart soul mind and
[26:17] strength
[26:19] there's only one way to serve God and
[26:20] that's all of you
[26:22] and God said that because he knows your
[26:24] heart and the Heart can be easily swayed
[26:26] by other gods and other things to
[26:28] worship brother Paul I don't worship any
[26:30] other gods tonight you don't you don't
[26:33] you have to be careful that because our
[26:34] heart can be swayed to worshiping and
[26:37] given our attention and given our all
[26:40] and given our heart to something else
[26:42] and eventually our worship to something
[26:44] else
[26:45] and God said I'm a I've got an exclusive
[26:48] I want an exclusive relationship and I
[26:51] want all my worship from your heart to
[26:53] come to me
[26:54] you don't let someone else who said
[26:56] something to you steal your joy
[26:59] make you depressed bring you down you
[27:02] can't let people control you like that
[27:04] you can't let the devil control you like
[27:07] that you can't let the devil steal your
[27:09] joy so quickly don't let them steal it
[27:11] at all you let people's comments on the
[27:14] internet and even face to face which
[27:16] they don't do much of it face to face
[27:18] today but there are little comments
[27:19] wonder what he's trying to say by that I
[27:21] wonder what she's saying by that I think
[27:23] she met me with that and so you let it
[27:25] steal your joy and your happiness and
[27:27] being able to enjoy the day because
[27:29] you've let somebody else's comments
[27:31] control you
[27:33] and I say don't let anybody steal your
[27:36] joy this thing is the Simplicity of
[27:38] Jesus Christ
[27:39] Paul said I fear lest any would beguile
[27:42] you as the serpent did Eve from the
[27:45] simplicity
[27:47] of Jesus Christ
[27:49] this message is the Simplicity of Jesus
[27:51] Christ but men have complicated it
[27:54] men have complicated it I just want to
[27:57] be a pure
[27:58] fruit bearing tree of God
[28:01] that can say don't complicate this thing
