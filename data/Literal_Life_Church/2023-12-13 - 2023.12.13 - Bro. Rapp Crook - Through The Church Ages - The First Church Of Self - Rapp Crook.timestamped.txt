[22:56] we're standing we can open up up in our
[22:58] Bibles to the Book of Revelation chapter
[23:01] 3 and we're in the last couple uh
[23:05] Services finishing up uh this little
[23:08] series we've done through the uh Church
[23:10] age book so we're excited to be now uh a
[23:14] little more in the present tense in re
[23:16] chapter 3 in the loudan age and we'll
[23:19] just start in in verse uh in verse
[23:23] 14 let's see
[23:26] here
[23:28] and then the angel of the Church of the
[23:31] Lans write these things Seth amen the
[23:35] faithful and true witness the beginning
[23:38] of the creation of God and since we
[23:41] started we've kind of looked at the how
[23:43] God identifies himself to each church
[23:47] and how the characteristics that the
[23:48] Accents in this introduction that has a
[23:51] direct bearing or connection with the uh
[23:55] trials and the struggles and the
[23:56] challenges of the particular particular
[23:58] age and here God's identifying himself
[24:00] as the the amen he has the last word and
[24:04] many times uh the devil likes to have
[24:06] the last word and um we can if you're
[24:09] having a discussion or an argument the
[24:10] other person oh you just there's this
[24:11] tendency you want to get the last word
[24:13] in well here we have the Assurance after
[24:16] all the Gentile dispensation is over God
[24:19] will have the last word the devil's not
[24:21] going to uh pull one over on him God has
[24:24] the last word he's faithful he's true
[24:28] the beginning of the creation of God and
[24:30] um it it's continuing Jesus was the
[24:33] beginning of the creation of God but it
[24:34] was just the beginning he wanted to be
[24:36] born not just in virgin born flesh you
[24:38] wanted to be born in our flesh it was
[24:40] just the beginning of that verse 15 I
[24:43] Know Thy works that while Thou Art
[24:46] neither cold nor hot I would that you
[24:50] would be cold or hot so then because you
[24:52] are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I
[24:54] will spew thee out of my mouth because
[24:58] thou sayest I'm rich increased with
[25:00] goods and have need of nothing yet know
[25:02] not Thou Art wretched and miserable and
[25:05] poor and blind and
[25:08] naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold
[25:11] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[25:13] rich with with true riches then and
[25:16] white rment that th mayest be clothed
[25:18] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[25:20] not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[25:22] isav that thou mayest see as many as I
[25:26] love I rebuke and chasen be zealous
[25:29] therefore and repent behold I stand at
[25:32] the door and
[25:34] knock If any man hear my voice the
[25:38] chances of that voice being heard seems
[25:41] quite slim he's knocking knocking
[25:43] knocking but if any man just happens to
[25:45] hear the knock let alone my voice I'll
[25:48] come into him and S with him and he with
[25:51] me to him that overcometh will I grant
[25:53] to sit with me in my throne even as I
[25:56] also overcame and him set sat down with
[25:58] my father and his throne he hath an ear
[26:01] let them hear what the spirit Seth unto
[26:03] the churches in this evening we're going
[26:06] to start talking about this laan church

[26:16] abil the opportunity and the freedom to
[26:18] gather here in a a warm building and a
[26:21] and a peaceful country Lord where War
[26:24] ravages other places and the um just let
[26:27] talking with uh dad on the way up uh um
[26:31] my brother in Israel there they go to
[26:34] church and there might be Rockets firing
[26:36] overhead but they are just going about
[26:38] their life in a new kind of normal I'm
[26:40] glad that we didn't have that here today
[26:42] we're thankful Lord for that I do pray
[26:44] Lord for for the situation in Israel
[26:47] Lord that you would watch over your
[26:48] people there Lord father I pray for the
[26:51] situation in Ukraine father we're um
[26:53] heading into a second winter now Lord I
[26:55] pray that youd take care of your
[26:56] children Lord Lord just watch over them
[26:59] we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus
[27:01] Christ amen God bless you all you may be
[27:06] seated just want to kind of get a a bit
[27:09] of a heading into the little bit of
[27:11] review from last uh um service um we
[27:16] looked how at the turn of the centuy the
[27:19] 1800s um phased to the
[27:22] 1900s uh after the Civil War there was a
[27:25] there was a Second Great Awakening that
[27:26] went across United States um DL Moody
[27:30] and others just across the country and
[27:32] the and mighty works of God were being
[27:35] done but as those Revival fires kind of
[27:39] petered out as we headed near the toward
[27:41] the turn of the
[27:42] century people in the established
[27:44] churches realized hey we've experienced
[27:47] the Revival fires before and they've
[27:49] died down and we we want them back what
[27:52] do we need to do to get the Revival
[27:54] fires to come back and there there was a
[27:56] general sense around the turn of the
[27:58] century that yeah what do we need to do
[28:00] to to get that back and like we said in
[28:03] 1896 a man named Charles Sheldon wrote
[28:07] this book in his steps which we talked
[28:09] about shared a little bit last two weeks
[28:12] ago about the little summary of the book
[28:14] but was an an encouragement to to
[28:16] Christians to to reach out in their
[28:18] communities uh to show the love of
[28:20] Christ to the to to to the needy and all
[28:23] good things um but um what this end what
[28:28] this end up gradually morphing into was
[28:31] a social gospel movement where and all
[28:34] these things are good we're supposed to
[28:36] care for a fellow man if somebody comes
[28:38] and and to our to our to our door and
[28:40] they have need or we meet them and we
[28:42] witness to them and they see they don't
[28:43] even have food don't have this we just
[28:45] say God bless you I've given you I fed
[28:47] your soul you should be happy and
[28:48] grateful now James says you're being a
[28:49] hypocrite we're supposed to care for our
[28:52] fellow man but um if we're just doing
[28:54] all the things caring for their physical
[28:56] needs and never looking at their
[28:58] spiritual needs we're really deceiving
[29:01] ourselves and them that we're doing
[29:03] anything of Eternal value and because um
[29:07] God cares about body but he also cares
[29:10] about uh the soul and the Bible's good
[29:13] news is much more than a social gospel
[29:16] and it almost cheapens it to say that
[29:19] we're just supposed to be kind to our
[29:20] neighbor and help them so they can have
[29:22] a better life in this world that's not
[29:25] the call of the Gospel that's certainly
[29:27] a part of it to to to to uh to be to
[29:30] love our neighbor as ourselves but we
[29:32] want to bring them to to Christ that's
[29:34] the ultimate thing and what this kind of
[29:36] brought to the church was we we we we
[29:39] sense an absence of Christ's presence so
[29:41] we need to be doing more works we need
[29:43] to be working to to try to get that back
[29:46] and we uh and our works are inqu to save
[29:50] ourselves much less somebody else what
[29:53] we saw last time was just at 1896 this
[29:57] book comes out just 10 years later God
[30:00] comes with the this this open door to a
[30:04] continued Revival and that was the isusa
[30:07] Street Revival there in Los Angeles
[30:10] California and he just it was just an
[30:13] outpouring of the holy spirit that went
[30:15] all over the country went around the
[30:16] world and that changed lives much more
[30:21] than a social gospel did so this is
[30:25] where we were looking um last week that
[30:28] as as the Revival fires kind of petered
[30:30] out at the turn of the century um God
[30:33] provided an emergency exit from this uh
[30:36] this cage of denominationalism because
[30:38] really what happened these uh these
[30:41] Church systems that God had used the
[30:43] Wesley and church system these other
[30:45] ones God had used them but they're not
[30:49] really nearly alive today as they they
[30:53] had been we looked at just a quoting
[30:55] from of a magazine from November
[30:57] remember of just a month ago the title
[31:00] was emergency exit the Wesleyan churches
[31:02] are are are are closing and some of the
[31:05] discussion talked about where do we go
[31:07] where do we go started back in 1972 when
[31:09] the church was discussing homosexuality
[31:12] for the for the for the clergy and this
[31:15] was Wesley's church the church was the
[31:17] church was becoming a cage that now
[31:20] people need to want to try to get out of
[31:23] but God had supplied this open door to
[31:25] escape from this cage of denomination
[31:27] nationalism that was the Revival by the
[31:30] Holy
[31:31] Spirit let's see
[31:36] here I'm off
[31:38] order in the notes on page one we just
[31:42] um um then down down in the middle from
[31:45] the Philadelphia and church age Brother
[31:47] brandom Talks at the end of the at the
[31:48] turn of the century the church
[31:49] denomination that gone back to education
[31:52] back to works again again the social
[31:55] kind of thing they'd gone back but but
[31:57] after the great denomination system had
[31:59] been set up Jesus set up the open door
[32:03] and this was he this is a place for them
[32:05] to enter into before they would go into
[32:07] the loudy and age and it's so important
[32:10] to catch the spirit for what God wants
[32:13] to do now amen and not just be trying to
[32:17] catch an anointing of something that's
[32:18] good to do I've been reading this week
[32:20] in the message trying to do God service
[32:22] without it being his will King David he
[32:26] had the vision to bring the Ark of the
[32:27] Covenant into Jerusalem see this seems
[32:30] like a really good thing to do he was
[32:33] completely sincere he wasn't trying to
[32:35] displease God he wasn't trying to sin he
[32:38] wanted to do something that was right
[32:40] yet he hadn't caught in he he hadn't
[32:42] caught God's anointing or the vision for
[32:44] that time that he was living and he
[32:46] ended up making a mistake and um it says
[32:51] brother brandham talks about um even the
[32:53] revivals um denominational revivals in
[32:55] the last uh century it was for a good
[32:58] purpose to bring people in the presence
[33:00] of God great Crusades and millions of
[33:03] people spent their money and put in
[33:04] great Crusades and churches all went
[33:06] together great auditoriums great things
[33:08] great things took
[33:10] place but why did It ultimately fail
[33:13] it's because they never knew the hour
[33:15] they were living in it's so important to
[33:17] know the time that we're living in and
[33:19] what we should expect for the hour that
[33:21] we're living in because if we're
[33:23] thinking man I want God to crisscross
[33:25] the country and just just bring
[33:27] thousands to the altar every service and
[33:29] just do that that's not the time we're
[33:31] living in this is a time of of of of
[33:33] gleaning preparing for the coming of the
[33:35] Lord if we get our expectations mixed up
[33:37] we'll be disappointed for no reason it's
[33:40] important to know the time that we're
[33:42] living
[33:43] in and he he continues oh brother listen
[33:46] what time are we living in what's the
[33:48] age what's the hour that we're in it's
[33:51] not time for these things that they're
[33:52] talking about that's past judgment's at
[33:55] hand now he talks we need to catch the
[33:57] Revelation he talks about this this
[33:59] Vision brother brandom had of the bride
[34:01] and trying to keep her in Step but what
[34:03] I want to want to emphasize it's
[34:04] important to see what is God trying to
[34:06] do now and catch the vision for that
[34:09] because if we can catch that Vision
[34:11] Isaiah 4031 says he shall run and not be
[34:15] weary you shall walk and not faint they
[34:18] that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[34:19] their strength we renew our strength
[34:22] when we're when we're anointed by his
[34:24] anointing when we've caught what he's
[34:26] doing we just kind of get in the flow
[34:27] and it carries us on but if we're trying
[34:30] to do good things on our own we'll be
[34:33] working really really hard and we might
[34:35] achieve some things but it's so much
[34:37] easier if we can catch the Winds of the
[34:39] spirit and go as he's moving at that
[34:44] time so as we're looking at the lysan
[34:47] church tonight this is a this is a very
[34:48] familiar passage of scripture and they
[34:51] probably won't be telling us anything
[34:53] that we haven't heard before but I just
[34:55] want to as we read the description that
[34:58] we see in Revelation 3 here I just want
[35:01] to highlight various characteristics of
[35:04] this laan church and we
[35:08] recognize that this is the culture that
[35:11] we live in and we know we've been called
[35:13] up higher we don't have to live in this
[35:16] particular church that's consumed with
[35:18] its own business and really churchianity
[35:20] is church Inc I mean some of these
[35:22] churches they run like big businesses
[35:24] you've got church investment officers
[35:26] you've got huge employees you've got all
[35:28] these it's it's it's it's a huge
[35:30] corporation these mega churches are we
[35:33] we we don't we're we're not called to
[35:35] that however because we live in this
[35:37] culture culture will affect us in ways
[35:40] that we some often won't perceive I just
[35:43] pray that as we read through this this
[35:45] evening that we can kind of examine our
[35:47] own lives Lord I don't want to be
[35:49] picking up this trait that seems so
[35:51] common because it's the culture I live
[35:53] in we're called to live differently and
[35:55] the uh the first I want to look at we
[35:58] can just see it in Revelation
[36:00] 3:15 when uh when Christ speaks about
[36:02] this church the first thing he says is I
[36:06] Know Thy
[36:08] works this is a busy Church they're
[36:13] doing all kinds of works and you can
[36:16] kind of see this start of the of the
[36:18] social gospel movement and going
[36:20] throughout the 20th century the churches
[36:22] are doing all kinds of things all over
[36:25] the world it's a busy church and
[36:29] Revelation 3:15 says I Know Thy works
[36:32] that's how Christ knows them and when I
[36:35] read this I thought over to another
[36:37] scripture where where at at the Judgment
[36:40] um different servants are coming uh
[36:43] before the Lord and they're excited I've
[36:45] done this for you God I've done this for
[36:46] you I've done this for you God but we
[36:49] don't want God just to know us by our
[36:50] works we want him to know us because it
[36:54] says I Know Thy works the question is
[36:56] does he know us and how often is it
[36:59] sometimes even in the even in the
[37:01] marriage relationship we can get so busy
[37:03] going doing this good thing and doing
[37:05] this good thing and doing going this
[37:07] doing this good thing and then we have a
[37:09] dinner out together man what do we talk
[37:12] about now because we've been so busy you
[37:14] almost lose contact for the person you
[37:17] know each other's works but do we still
[37:19] know one another and we don't want that
[37:23] to be our relationship with God we're
[37:25] always busy doing this doing that doing
[37:27] that Lord I hope my works are good for
[37:28] you enough today because I'm doing my
[37:30] best aren't you appreciating it God and
[37:32] then sometimes we can speaking from
[37:35] experience you can be praying for
[37:37] something in your life particular
[37:39] blessing and you feel like you're
[37:40] working your tail off for the Lord and
[37:42] then you don't get what you were praying
[37:44] for it says God I've earned this I've
[37:47] put my time in and why is this why is
[37:51] this disappointment here why is this
[37:52] disappointment here and what he might
[37:54] just be saying is you've worked enough
[37:56] for me I don't need to know your works I
[37:58] want to know you would you just put this
[38:00] side put put these other things down and
[38:02] I'm going to I'll give it to you but I'm
[38:04] even better than that thing you want I
[38:07] want you to know me and that's what this
[38:10] church is missing out on they're so busy
[38:13] doing all these things and they're
[38:14] deceived thinking these are really good
[38:16] things to do because this I think that I
[38:20] I think this came up at the turn of the
[38:21] century they wanted to get the Revival
[38:23] back so they got doing all these good
[38:25] works because when you do good work it
[38:27] is more blessed to give than to
[38:29] receive Christians feel blessed when
[38:32] they give the unbeliever feels blessed
[38:34] when they give and you leave feeling
[38:36] like you've done a done done a good
[38:38] thing but it's even more blessed to
[38:40] receive the holy spirit of God and have
[38:42] your life change that's the most
[38:44] important thing and that's God's
[38:46] ultimate vision for us you just kind of
[38:49] Wonder as as you read this though this
[38:52] is a busy Church does this busy Church
[38:55] even know notice that Christ is no
[38:58] longer with
[39:01] them the sense of his absence is what
[39:04] motivated them to start doing all these
[39:06] works but they've gotten so busy do they
[39:09] even realize that Christ isn't there
[39:11] anymore he's outside the door and he's
[39:15] knocking do they even hear the
[39:19] knock do we even hear the knock
[39:21] sometimes we can get so busy doing this
[39:24] and that and like man just brother Paul
[39:27] said the other day yeah we try to have
[39:29] our Bible reading time in the morning if
[39:31] it's gotten too busy try to do it in the
[39:32] evening but Som we get too busy in the
[39:34] evening and that can get a habit after a
[39:36] while
[39:38] and he's still
[39:40] knocking but if we're so busy we can't
[39:42] even hear the knock do we hear the voice
[39:44] also and it's so easy it used to be if
[39:48] somebody asked you how you were doing
[39:50] the default answer it wouldn't be good
[39:52] it'd be fine I'm doing fine now that's
[39:54] not the default answer how are you doing
[39:57] oh been
[39:58] busy that's what we say and it's a
[40:00] completely acceptable
[40:02] answer but really that's not an
[40:04] acceptable answer I don't care what
[40:07] you've been doing I care about you how
[40:10] are you doing not all the things that
[40:12] you're doing but the culture affects us
[40:16] we don't want to be a busy church I
[40:19] quoted this uh uh aw toer last time but
[40:24] this talk about this this busy Church he
[40:26] says if the Holy Spirit was withdrawn
[40:28] from the church today 95% of what we do
[40:32] would go on and no one would know the
[40:35] difference because Church Inc is very
[40:38] well set up they've got layers of who's
[40:41] responsible for this who's responsible
[40:43] for that they've got an Outreach
[40:44] coordinator they've got the data who
[40:46] came and visited we can massage the data
[40:48] we can manipulate the data we can we can
[40:49] draw conclusions have to be more
[40:51] successful here or there and the things
[40:52] will go
[40:54] on even if the Holy Spirit weren't there
[40:57] 95% would go on he he says but if the
[41:00] Holy Spirit had been withdrawn from the
[41:02] New Testament Church 95% of what they
[41:06] did would
[41:08] stop and everybody would know the
[41:10] difference what was up in church
[41:13] tonight something wasn't quite right
[41:16] we've got to seek God because I don't
[41:18] want to have a I I I I don't want to go
[41:19] just go through the motions I don't want
[41:21] to be busy just having Church be part of
[41:23] my account be part of my schedule I want
[41:25] I got to meet God for church that's how
[41:27] the New Testament Church would have
[41:28] approached it if God weren't there we've
[41:31] got to we' we've got we've got to get
[41:33] serious about this they would notice
[41:36] it and toer says I wonder would it even
[41:40] be noticed
[41:42] today and we don't want that to describe
[41:45] Us by any means but Lord help us not to
[41:48] be
[41:51] busy he goes on I know your works but
[41:55] Thou Art neither cold nor hot I would
[41:58] you were cold or hot they've just been
[42:00] exercising they're just they've got a
[42:02] warm sweat that's they they they they've
[42:04] been working it's all he says we're warm
[42:07] but he says I don't want you to be
[42:09] lukewarm I want you to be either cold or
[42:11] hot you know what you can ask somebody
[42:13] something um um you can you can uh you
[42:17] can take somebody to show show them
[42:19] you're really interested in you maybe
[42:21] you've got this particular um video you
[42:23] watch that just really spoke to you in
[42:25] some way or this particular sermon you
[42:27] watch it was just really special to you
[42:29] whatever it might be or this work of art
[42:31] think is really cool really spoke to you
[42:33] and you show it to somebody and say what
[42:34] what do you think about it they look at
[42:36] it look at it
[42:38] interesting that's
[42:40] right what a non committal lukewarm
[42:44] answer interesting is what you say when
[42:47] you don't really care but you want to
[42:49] sound interested you want to give an
[42:52] unoffensive answer without committing
[42:55] yourself either way
[42:57] way that's what people yeah what do you
[43:00] think about the church this evening that
[43:01] was interesting thought interesting but
[43:04] does it move you no it's interesting
[43:07] it's really things are easy to it's easy
[43:09] to say interesting if you're just
[43:10] sitting in your chair sipping your
[43:12] coffee interesting
[43:15] interesting but if something really
[43:17] moves you you'll jump off wow that was
[43:21] fantastic that's right that is that's
[43:24] either you want that response
[43:26] or you say no that's ridiculous look at
[43:29] the technique he used the colors they
[43:32] clashed that shows you care give me
[43:35] either cold or hot but not
[43:38] interesting give me something I can
[43:40] respond with but so often nowadays it's
[43:44] indifferent right I mean Independence
[43:47] that's this huge class of Voters right
[43:50] they which way we got to have to P
[43:52] someone who who cares this L and I've
[43:55] always kind of thought Luke lukewarm you
[43:56] know growing up in the church you hear
[43:57] this talked about what does lukewarm
[44:00] mean well I just kind of L around
[44:02] looking for looking for synonyms in
[44:04] different ways like this and when you
[44:06] kind of build out the meaning it can
[44:09] affect us quite a bit half-hearted
[44:13] indecisive
[44:15] unresponsive double-minded apathetic
[44:18] wishy-washy indifferent
[44:22] irresolute there's no
[44:24] response and God lays out his word and
[44:27] he wants a response imagine if you get
[44:29] on your knee and propose and the girl
[44:33] says wow you're an interesting
[44:36] guy that's not what you want when you're
[44:38] laying your heart but God is doing that
[44:41] he's laying his heart and he
[44:42] was interesting and no give me something
[44:46] I can he said respond give me something
[44:49] I can work
[44:50] with but when I've thought about
[44:52] interesting sorry um lukewarm in the
[44:55] past is always always kind of been yeah
[44:57] compromising life or you're doing things
[44:59] you probably shouldn't be doing and just
[45:01] kind of not really yeah you're kind of
[45:04] um watering down the word in some way
[45:07] but i' never really thought about it the
[45:09] way brother Brandon speaks about it here
[45:10] in the here in the church age book and
[45:13] I'll just just share this quote and he's
[45:15] crying out to this last age you have the
[45:18] word you have more Bibles than ever you
[45:21] can look how how many bibles do we have
[45:23] on our shelves we've got our we've got
[45:25] our phone how many versions of the Bible
[45:27] you have we have the whole message there
[45:29] on our phone but he says you've got all
[45:32] of this but you're not doing anything
[45:34] about the word except dividing it and
[45:37] hacking it into pieces taking what you
[45:40] want and leaving out what you don't want
[45:42] you are not interested in living it but
[45:46] debating it but talking about it but
[45:49] discussing it sharing these ideas and
[45:52] this is kind of reminiscent of what Paul
[45:54] found on Mars Hill people gathered
[45:57] together to hear what the new thought
[46:00] was just take look at look at the news
[46:02] look at look what's new on my feed and
[46:04] say okay now I feel like I'm up to date
[46:06] but nothing's really moving me to take
[46:08] any action I'm just kind of
[46:10] interesting I'm just talking about it
[46:12] I'm debating it that ate Paul up because
[46:16] he is sharing this precious truth I want
[46:19] you to do something with it and he got
[46:22] frustrated I think on Mari s because a
[46:24] lot of people just got there to talk
[46:26] about it talk about it talk about it a
[46:27] few people were interested in living it
[46:31] and they left with Paul and he took them
[46:33] further lukewarm is just talking about
[46:37] it but not really caring enough to
[46:40] actually live it I'd never really seen
[46:43] it that
[46:44] way just
[46:47] continuing again the thought was you're
[46:49] not interested in living it but debating
[46:52] it I would sooner you were cold or hot
[46:54] now debates can get kind of hot but if
[46:57] we're not careful it's just hot because
[46:59] we want to be right instead of actually
[47:03] be right in our
[47:04] heart that's not the kind of hot that
[47:06] God wants I wish that you if you were
[47:08] cold and rejected I could stand that I
[47:11] might even able to respect your opinion
[47:13] I don't know but if you would get white
[47:15] hot to know its truth and live it I'd
[47:18] praise you for that but when you simply
[47:21] take my word and don't honor it I in
[47:25] return my must refuse to honor you I
[47:27] will spew you out for you nauseate me
[47:32] and I'd never seen luke warm in quite
[47:35] this way that you care enough about it
[47:36] because you want to live it and not just
[47:39] talk about it or or or debate it and um
[47:42] because you know what truth that's a
[47:45] certain thing truth demands a response
[47:49] anytime anytime you have an exclamation
[47:51] point at the end of a sentence it
[47:53] Demands a response it just man it's out
[47:56] there and Truth is is that um it's like
[48:01] your alarm clock in the
[48:04] morning it demands a response and some
[48:07] of us um when our when our mothers go to
[48:10] wake us up in the morning hopefully
[48:12] nearly everyone in the building is past
[48:15] that level but when mother comes to way
[48:17] except when she probably doesn't go oh
[48:19] sweetheart it's time to get up come on
[48:21] honey will you please get up now come on
[48:23] it's it's About Time come on come on
[48:25] please come on on come on no that's
[48:29] that's like a dot dot dot punctuation I
[48:32] heard about somebody a family member um
[48:36] um Brian bog my uh my uncle-in-law he
[48:40] said his dad would come in wak up in the
[48:42] morning if they weren't up in a few
[48:43] minutes he'd come in with a bowl of
[48:45] water and just start pouring on their
[48:47] head that is an exclamation point that
[48:50] Demands a response and that is what God
[48:53] does when he's saying repent the kingdom
[48:55] of heaven is at hand John the Baptist
[48:56] and saying would you please just come to
[48:59] the water it's not cold it's just a nice
[49:02] temperature would you please you'll feel
[49:04] so much better that's not how truth
[49:06] Works truth is an exclamation but repent
[49:08] get down there now you're going to
[49:10] die that is ex that is how truth works
[49:15] or behold the bridegroom comes go out to
[49:18] meet him and we hope when this is going
[49:20] off we respond more actively than we do
[49:23] with
[49:24] our alarm clock in the morning the
[49:27] bridegroom comes snooze snooze snooze no
[49:30] this is an exclamation point we want to
[49:32] go out to meet him now this is what I've
[49:34] lived for this is what I've been waiting
[49:35] for we're going to go out now that's an
[49:38] exclamation point
[49:41] however if you're just lukewarm you're
[49:44] just going to sit there and talk about
[49:45] it talk about it and that is so much
[49:48] different than actually living it and if
[49:52] we take a look at this next next uh
[49:55] verses 15 and 16 which we've quoted them
[49:58] about about the
[50:00] lukewarmness let's just see some of the
[50:02] proof of the lukewarmness we see it in
[50:04] verse
[50:06] 17 because thou sayest I am rich I am
[50:12] increased with Goods I have need of
[50:14] nothing and knowest not that you are
[50:17] wretched and miserable and poor and
[50:18] blind and
[50:22] naked these Lans this loudan church is
[50:25] monopolizing the conversation I'm going
[50:28] to get ahead of myself here but this is
[50:29] also the talking church this is the only
[50:32] church age that's talking this
[50:35] much they're saying everything that
[50:37] they've been doing
[50:40] and brother brandom says you're not
[50:42] interested in living it but debating it
[50:45] you're the talking church if you'd get
[50:47] white hot to know the truth and live it
[50:49] it'd be different but you're just
[50:51] talking about it talking about it that's
[50:54] a sign
[50:56] of
[50:57] lukewarmness and um just kind of go back
[50:59] to the idea that truth has this
[51:01] exclamation point behind it exclamation
[51:03] point But it Demands a response well if
[51:06] you have an exclamation point you really
[51:08] can't just say oh that's interesting it
[51:10] demands something more than that kind of
[51:12] response however the um the the the qu
[51:18] the culture today is more of one to kind
[51:20] of hold the exclamation points off and
[51:23] just kind of examine them with questions
[51:26] question question and questions can be
[51:30] completely legit and that's how we find
[51:32] out more from God by asking questions
[51:35] however questions can also just be a way
[51:39] of showing off one's own
[51:41] knowledge I can remember one time I when
[51:44] I was studying at Wittenberg um we had
[51:46] this um I think it was the dictator of
[51:50] Yugoslavia Tito his I think
[51:53] granddaughter had come and and she was
[51:55] was there speaking and that was I I was
[51:58] doing communist studies and I I I was
[52:00] there well there was one person there in
[52:02] the audience after she gives her address
[52:05] and he wanted to ask a question well
[52:08] after five minutes he still hadn't asked
[52:11] the question and my professor's like
[52:13] could you get to your question he was
[52:16] just there to ask his question show how
[52:18] much he knew and make himself great
[52:21] that's not the purpose of asking a
[52:22] question but that's the perhaps the loud
[52:25] to seean way of asking a question just
[52:27] showing off how much I know but that's
[52:30] not what real questions are about
[52:33] questions can also serve to downplay the
[52:36] significance of Truth so you have the
[52:39] exclamation point truth is that really
[52:42] so what might need another perspective
[52:45] on that or
[52:47] really we might need to wait about that
[52:50] what what about this what about that and
[52:52] it can kind of downplay how important
[52:54] this truth is gradually trying to hammer
[52:57] this exclamation point and transform it
[53:00] into a more convenient question mark
[53:02] because you know when somebody asks you
[53:03] a question an appropriate response would
[53:06] be
[53:07] interesting but that's not the
[53:09] appropriate response with to a truth
[53:11] claim with an exclamation
[53:13] point sometimes um debating just by
[53:17] asking questions is a Sure Fire way
[53:19] never to be wrong because you're never
[53:21] positing anything you're just
[53:24] questioning
[53:25] everything and that's kind of the
[53:28] culture of today and I would say this is
[53:30] kind of a the poster child for
[53:33] lukewarmness today and the pope asked a
[53:37] question and he just says yeah who am I
[53:40] to judge and that sounds wow really good
[53:43] he's non-judgmental that's he's got he's
[53:45] getting all the boxes checked for being
[53:47] a a politically correct pontiff but who
[53:51] am I to judge this is just a question
[53:53] and he's not really positing anything
[53:55] and and you've probably uh this this
[53:58] Pope will discuss everything
[54:00] everything's Up For Debate but he stands
[54:02] for very little except one thing he
[54:04] wants to save the world from climate
[54:06] change that is something he really wants
[54:08] to take care of but as far as what God
[54:11] really teaches what his word says what
[54:14] we should do yeah who am I to
[54:18] judge now conservatives within the
[54:21] Catholic Church are very wary of uh uh
[54:23] Pope Francis and he recently had a Cod a
[54:27] a meeting there in the Vatican it was a
[54:29] sinod on
[54:31] synodality which is basically a meeting
[54:33] for pastors to get together and talk
[54:35] about being pastors um and this this is
[54:39] a um this letter this article came from
[54:43] one of the men who was there um priest
[54:45] Raymond dusza from Canada and he says he
[54:49] was um lamenting that this this Pope is
[54:53] one who's always asking questions and
[54:55] giving all this uncertainty and that's
[54:57] he says no man is going to give his life
[54:59] for a question mark but he will give his
[55:01] life for an exclamation point it says
[55:03] question marks seem to litter the
[55:05] landscape and certainty appears to be a
[55:07] problem not the solution because
[55:09] certainty makes us
[55:11] uncomfortable but without truth we're
[55:14] only left with our own conclusions which
[55:17] aren't Truth worth dying for and thus
[55:19] aren't truths worth living for there's
[55:22] no purpose for living anymore if there's
[55:25] no certainty and I think this this
[55:27] article by this this priest Raymond dza
[55:30] says cathol do Catholics need questions
[55:32] no they need answers he's calling for
[55:34] for for certainty but I think he's he's
[55:35] on to something because the devil's
[55:37] strategies take every question then look
[55:40] at sorry every exclamation point look at
[55:42] it from every possible angle so
[55:45] gradually you can create a question mark
[55:48] behind the certainty of Truth and then
[55:50] gradually this becomes with more
[55:52] malicious intent and they'll just power
[55:55] that exclamation point into the ground
[55:57] get rid of the certainty and erect
[55:59] question marks in the landscape every
[56:01] single place so no one knows really what
[56:03] they stand for and if don't stand for
[56:05] anything a proper response is that's
[56:08] interesting but God wants he he has a
[56:11] plan for our lives he has something he
[56:13] wants us to to do he has a he has a
[56:15] purpose I think a large it's um it's
[56:19] symptomatic of this lack of certainty of
[56:22] all these question marks that there is a
[56:24] purpose lessness there is a there is a
[56:27] there is anxiety there is depression
[56:29] people wonder what Am I Living For and
[56:32] we talked last time a little bit about
[56:34] um about the the isms that came in
[56:37] during the 17 and 1800s and when you've
[56:40] got uh um Darwin removing any kind of
[56:44] special origin how could you have a how
[56:46] could there be a plan for your life if
[56:49] the beginning was completely random
[56:50] everything else would be random as well
[56:52] if you take away that beginning and you
[56:55] take away any kind of purpose in the
[56:57] future because there's no afterlife and
[57:00] what's so special about this anyway
[57:03] there isn't a there isn't a purpose
[57:04] that's been that's been eroded away by
[57:06] the devil but in truth the truth is an
[57:09] exclamation point there is a purpose of
[57:11] our life and God wants us to find it and
[57:14] do it and he doesn't want us to look
[57:16] look at truth and say Ah that's
[57:18] interesting want to get us up off the
[57:20] couch and off doing something about it
[57:23] but lukewarm is just willing to discuss
[57:26] but do very little Satan does everything
[57:29] he can to remove certainty beating
[57:33] exclamation point into the question
[57:34] marks he will do that in our own lives
[57:37] he'll do that as he he raises questions
[57:40] and criticisms of God's truth he will do
[57:43] that as we are going through trials um I
[57:47] think brother Paul just last Sunday was
[57:49] telling us about uh he was reminding us
[57:51] about what brother brandham said was his
[57:53] greatest trial when that his his wife
[57:56] had just passed away Sharon Rose was
[57:58] passing was was dying there in the
[58:01] basement of the hospital and he was down
[58:03] there and then the Devil comes up beside
[58:05] him and starts Whispering whispering and
[58:08] he says you've been preaching all over
[58:09] the world all over you've been having
[58:11] meetings you've been doing this and
[58:13] didn't your dad just die as you and you
[58:15] were you were hardly able to get there
[58:16] and your brother passed away as you were
[58:18] behind the pulpit and he all the devil
[58:20] was doing was asking questions is it
[58:23] didn't this happen
[58:25] didn't this happen and when something is
[58:27] posed as a question it seems less
[58:31] dangerous if some were to come out and
[58:32] say God doesn't care about you you
[58:35] wouldn't listen you wouldn't give it the
[58:36] time of day but when it's posed there's
[58:38] a question is this true that that
[58:39] happened that way did that really
[58:41] happened that way that really happened
[58:43] and what the devil's asking all these
[58:44] questions to get this sense oh oh then
[58:48] you say yeah that did happen that did
[58:50] happen that did happen therefore maybe
[58:53] God doesn't care care about that's what
[58:56] the devil's trying to draw us to this
[58:58] conclusion and when we interact with
[59:00] these questions we're almost
[59:02] participating in our own deception but
[59:06] there is certainty because and at the
[59:08] end of it brother brandom says
[59:10] everything the devil told me was
[59:13] true and that sense of true factual it
[59:16] really happened but the interpretation
[59:18] he put to it was completely false and
[59:22] that's facts and Truth are completely
[59:24] two different things Satan will play
[59:26] with the facts and create a different
[59:28] narrative create a different storyline
[59:30] that's completely wrong because we
[59:32] recognize the facts willing to give at
[59:34] the time of the day and as he's doing
[59:35] that he just gradually hammering every
[59:38] exclamation point of certainty away in
[59:39] her life and raising the question marks
[59:42] where is God and then we don't really
[59:45] stand for it's hard to stand for
[59:46] anything and then lukewarmness is more
[59:48] of a natural
[59:50] condition so we've got a a busy Church
[59:54] we've got the the lukewarm church and
[59:56] this is like I mentioned the first
[59:59] church we could talk about being the
[1:00:00] talking church because they're
[1:00:03] monopolizing the conversation and uh in
[1:00:06] verse um in verse 17 brother Brandon
[1:00:09] references here look at the first phrase
[1:00:11] of this verse because thou sayest see
[1:00:14] they were
[1:00:16] speaking God's right there and man if I
[1:00:18] could have a meeting with God I would
[1:00:19] just love to listen and hear what he
[1:00:21] says they're like man if I had a meeting
[1:00:23] with God I'd love to tell God all the
[1:00:25] stuff I've done for him that's what they
[1:00:28] were taking this time with it says the
[1:00:29] church is no longer the mouthpiece of
[1:00:31] God it is its own
[1:00:35] mouthpiece and like we said I'm rich
[1:00:37] increased with Goods have need of
[1:00:39] nothing it's like the guy on the date
[1:00:40] saying I'm sure you're quite interesting
[1:00:42] but I prefer to talk about
[1:00:44] me that's what the church is saying to
[1:00:46] God I'm sure you're quite interesting
[1:00:48] God but I've got all kinds of great
[1:00:49] things tell about me just give me an
[1:00:50] hour of your time God and you'll be
[1:00:52] blessed to hear all the things I've done
[1:00:53] for you
[1:00:55] this kind of reminded me of 2 Timothy 3
[1:00:57] this know also in the last days perilous
[1:00:59] time shall come for men shall be lovers
[1:01:03] of their own selves it's a
[1:01:06] narcissistic age and everything this CH
[1:01:09] this talking church is saying um it's
[1:01:14] self-referential
[1:01:16] self-absorbed the church is speaking all
[1:01:19] of its own works you don't see the
[1:01:21] church saying anything what God's done
[1:01:23] for them you don't anything about the
[1:01:25] great alls sufficient atoning work that
[1:01:28] Christ paid on the cross you don't see
[1:01:30] any of that of Christ's work and the
[1:01:33] great thing in in in Hebrews Paul says
[1:01:35] that work on the cross once for all
[1:01:39] completely taken care of but this church
[1:01:42] is so busy they have to complete doing
[1:01:43] this this this this they're missing out
[1:01:45] on the greatest work it's not even in
[1:01:47] their
[1:01:48] conversation the church is speaking of
[1:01:50] its own Works rather than of Christ's
[1:01:52] works is all Aton work at Calvary it's
[1:01:56] really substituted its own programs it's
[1:01:58] talking about that more than Christ's
[1:02:02] power not only is this church too busy
[1:02:05] to notice Christ's absence but they're
[1:02:07] really monopolizing the conversation
[1:02:09] even if he were there inside the church
[1:02:12] he'd probably have a hard time getting a
[1:02:13] word in
[1:02:14] edgewise he there isn't room for him to
[1:02:18] speak and it's
[1:02:21] amazing this church as for all that's
[1:02:23] talking
[1:02:25] it's not a Praying
[1:02:26] church it's a talking church because all
[1:02:30] their they're up there in their soap box
[1:02:31] they're not s singing it's me it's me
[1:02:34] it's me oh Lord standing in the need of
[1:02:35] prayer they have no need they're just
[1:02:38] saying it's me it's me me oh Lord look
[1:02:40] all that I've done that's their song all
[1:02:43] about themselves they're not
[1:02:47] praying they all kinds of talking but
[1:02:49] they're not praying
[1:02:51] why because this age does everything it
[1:02:54] can to remove any sense of
[1:02:58] need everything is cool everything is
[1:03:00] fine you don't need anything we've got
[1:03:03] something to make you feel better here
[1:03:05] something to make you feel better here
[1:03:06] there really isn't any need and it is
[1:03:09] helplessness which none of us want that
[1:03:11] feeling of helplessness but it is
[1:03:13] helplessness that fuels our prayers if
[1:03:17] we don't feel helpless we'll solve the
[1:03:20] problems on our own we'll try to but if
[1:03:21] we feel helpless that's when we'll fall
[1:03:23] on our knees and really SE God and there
[1:03:27] was a Norwegian man named oh halby and
[1:03:29] he he wrote this book on prayer I've
[1:03:31] I've read it it's a good one I never
[1:03:33] grow weary of emphasizing our
[1:03:35] helplessness this is not loud toan
[1:03:38] loudan is emphasizing how great you are
[1:03:40] all that we've done but he says i' never
[1:03:42] grow weary of emphasizing our
[1:03:44] helplessness for it is the decisive
[1:03:47] Factor not only in our prayer life but
[1:03:50] in our whole relationship to God if we
[1:03:53] feel helpless we can be encouraged God
[1:03:56] is there to do something in our lives it
[1:03:59] might not be right away the right hand
[1:04:00] of his power for the fall preached about
[1:04:03] it might be this the mysterious working
[1:04:05] of God's left hand where he's working
[1:04:07] with us working with us but he's going
[1:04:09] to be working with us and if we feel
[1:04:11] helpless we know that God we can call
[1:04:13] out for him and he will show himself
[1:04:15] like he never has before we will leave
[1:04:17] the situation more established and
[1:04:19] certain those exclamation points will
[1:04:22] not Bend they will not break they will
[1:04:24] come out polished and stronger than ever
[1:04:27] as long as we are conscious of our
[1:04:30] helplessness we will expect nothing of
[1:04:34] ourselves and therefore bring all of our
[1:04:36] difficulties and hindrances To God In
[1:04:39] Prayer that is so important to be
[1:04:41] conscious of our
[1:04:44] helplessness if we're conscious of all
[1:04:45] the things that we can do will never
[1:04:47] come to God but if we're conscious of
[1:04:49] our
[1:04:50] helplessness then we can throw ourselves
[1:04:52] upon the Lord and see work like never
[1:04:55] before but you know what this church has
[1:04:58] no
[1:04:59] needs no
[1:05:01] prayer no praise really no awareness of
[1:05:05] Christ in their
[1:05:07] life our helplessness is what draws us
[1:05:11] to see God's hand in our life but if we
[1:05:14] if everything is great we've got the
[1:05:16] best car the best job everybody's
[1:05:18] healthy and their family we don't even
[1:05:21] look to
[1:05:22] God only when we man Lord I need you God
[1:05:27] I don't know what we're going to do
[1:05:29] would you help us God then he shows
[1:05:31] himself and we see and we value and him
[1:05:35] like never
[1:05:36] before so
[1:05:41] important so important we don't want we
[1:05:43] don't want to be this kind of
[1:05:45] church we we want to we don't want to be
[1:05:47] the talking Church we're to talk about
[1:05:48] all the things that we've done we're
[1:05:50] going to talk about what God has done
[1:05:52] and you know what praying is more than
[1:05:54] just talking praying is taking time to
[1:05:59] listen and that's hard that's hard you
[1:06:04] pray you pick up your Bible you read you
[1:06:07] wait you wait you're not thinking God
[1:06:09] I've prayed about this and it's 30
[1:06:11] minutes further I've got to go now Lord
[1:06:13] I need my answer now we you like if
[1:06:14] we're used to Google we ask our question
[1:06:16] of Google in two milliseconds we've got
[1:06:18] our answer we can go but God he wants us
[1:06:22] to care about the answer answer as much
[1:06:24] as he cares about the answer and it's
[1:06:27] that time of waiting where we really
[1:06:30] come to care if you can get your answer
[1:06:32] in two milliseconds you're willing to
[1:06:34] rephrase the question to get a different
[1:06:36] answer in two milliseconds you really
[1:06:39] you just want to find an answer that
[1:06:41] works for you but God wants to have you
[1:06:43] to have an answer that's true and that
[1:06:47] waiting is part of the process to make
[1:06:49] sure that we are tuned in to him just
[1:06:52] like we need to be so that we'll have
[1:06:53] those the value for truth like he has
[1:06:55] the value for
[1:06:58] truth moving on to Revelation chapter
[1:07:02] 3 so because thou sayest in verse 17 I
[1:07:05] am rich and increased with Goods have
[1:07:06] need of
[1:07:08] nothing and knowest not that thou art
[1:07:12] wretched that's a bad word
[1:07:16] wretched that you you don't hear that
[1:07:19] much anymore but what what a what a
[1:07:21] Wretched Man I am but that Paul writes
[1:07:24] that or John bunan writes that but
[1:07:26] wretched that is really bad you're in a
[1:07:30] really bad condition you think youve
[1:07:33] you're rich but no you're
[1:07:36] wretched you think you have need of
[1:07:38] nothing but you're
[1:07:40] miserable this is really like the guy
[1:07:43] who's high on his drugs and he thinks
[1:07:45] I've got everything but he can't we can
[1:07:48] see the drug addict how terrible he is
[1:07:52] that is the picture of this
[1:07:55] church completely high on drugs As Long
[1:07:58] As I Got the high I'm great and I think
[1:08:01] I've got everything I'm rich increased
[1:08:04] with Goods I don't need
[1:08:06] anything and you don't know you're
[1:08:09] wretched you think you're happy but
[1:08:11] you're miserable excuse me you're poor
[1:08:14] blind naked all of these things this is
[1:08:18] a church that's a desensitized
[1:08:22] Church
[1:08:26] and the and the the mystery here
[1:08:29] is how can you not know
[1:08:32] this he say you're rich increased with
[1:08:35] Goods have need of nothing and knowest
[1:08:37] not that you're wretched poor miserable
[1:08:40] blind naked how can you not know
[1:08:47] this but you know if you've become
[1:08:51] desensitized if you've lost your
[1:08:54] feeling you really
[1:08:57] don't it's happened so gradually the
[1:09:00] person who has lost their feeling is
[1:09:02] probably the one most unaware that
[1:09:05] they've lost the
[1:09:06] feeling and they think they can do
[1:09:09] everything just fine if I could just you
[1:09:12] could just humor me for just a moment
[1:09:14] with an
[1:09:16] example we think it could be a really
[1:09:19] easy task to peel a mandarin
[1:09:22] orange although not everybody knows the
[1:09:25] best way of peeling a mandarin
[1:09:27] orange cuz I find these around my house
[1:09:30] with a little dime sized pieces going
[1:09:33] from Dan to beers Sheba you see you can
[1:09:35] TR see exactly where this child has
[1:09:36] eaten the Mandarin orange all over the
[1:09:38] place the real connoisseur of mandin
[1:09:41] oranges will peel this thing so it's all
[1:09:43] the way around you have One Piece One
[1:09:47] Piece I think it's easy it's not that
[1:09:49] hard to do you can do it pretty easily
[1:09:51] but if you've gradually lost your sense
[1:09:54] of feeling and we can replicate this by
[1:09:56] putting oven mitts on I could peel this
[1:10:00] very easily but when I lose my sense of
[1:10:03] feeling it's quite difficult I can do my
[1:10:07] the best I can and this is the this is
[1:10:10] the the the the church who thinks we're
[1:10:12] so busy doing great things for God we we
[1:10:15] can we look at the big buildings have
[1:10:17] got the great programs I've got I can I
[1:10:19] can spend hours of your time telling you
[1:10:22] but because you gradually lose your
[1:10:24] sense of feeling you're the last one to
[1:10:26] know you've lost your sense of feeling
[1:10:28] say I can do it I can do it look but you
[1:10:31] really it takes a sitation like this to
[1:10:33] real I can't peel this thing I'm doing
[1:10:35] the very best I finally got one little
[1:10:37] piece out it takes a long time because
[1:10:40] I've lost my sense of feeling and that's
[1:10:42] what this church is like they've lost
[1:10:44] their sense of feeling thinking I can do
[1:10:46] everything I used to be able to do I'm
[1:10:48] going to do it I'm I'm going to prove it
[1:10:50] it'll take me an hour to get this thing
[1:10:52] peeled and it'll be terribly messy it's
[1:10:54] not going to work but if you would just
[1:10:57] one time have your feeling restored by
[1:11:00] the Holy Spirit where you be sensitive
[1:11:02] to his voice like you were the first
[1:11:04] time he spoke to you then it would be
[1:11:06] just so easy just to peel that thing
[1:11:07] back and keep it all at one piece it
[1:11:10] wouldn't be a messy thing but you know
[1:11:12] what when when it's just man's Works
[1:11:14] trying to please God it's a messy thing
[1:11:16] you can see exactly what the man's done
[1:11:18] you see all these little pieces of Mand
[1:11:20] and orange peel going from one side to
[1:11:22] to the other but when God does it it's
[1:11:23] just nice neat it's done it's beautiful
[1:11:26] that's what we that this church has lost
[1:11:29] their sense of feeling and we don't want
[1:11:33] that to happen to us by any means how
[1:11:38] happen Matthew 24:12 gives us a hint it
[1:11:43] says because iniquity shall
[1:11:47] abound the love of many waxes
[1:11:50] cold sin very very
[1:11:54] gradually very gradually deadens our
[1:11:57] senses so that we gradually lose the
[1:12:01] sense that I'm doing something that is
[1:12:03] actually going to be harmful to me and I
[1:12:06] tell my kids that I've used this as an
[1:12:08] example to my kids at school was a great
[1:12:10] Chaple service I sat in the very front
[1:12:13] took my shoe off took my sock off and
[1:12:15] got a sharp knife out because through
[1:12:17] all the years of basketball playing I've
[1:12:18] got a very nice siiz callus right on my
[1:12:22] on my right foot and I show I could go
[1:12:23] like this with that knife I won't feel a
[1:12:26] thing because I've lost sense there and
[1:12:30] some people are actually uh
[1:12:34] born unable to feel pain and that's
[1:12:38] called congenital insensi insensitivity
[1:12:42] to pain and that might sound wonderful
[1:12:46] but it's actually quite a dangerous
[1:12:49] situation to be in and you could say
[1:12:52] when a person loses es his ability to
[1:12:55] hear the voice of God like this loud to
[1:12:58] see in church he's on the outside of the
[1:13:01] church
[1:13:02] knocking and the Bible say If any man
[1:13:05] hear my voice if any man hears my voice
[1:13:08] if you've lost your ability to hear the
[1:13:11] voice of God that's kind of like
[1:13:14] silencing your home's fire
[1:13:16] alarms so that you will have a good rest
[1:13:19] at
[1:13:20] night and you might have good rest at
[1:13:22] night for many nights but that one night
[1:13:26] when you need your fire alarm to work
[1:13:28] and you can't hear it anymore because
[1:13:30] youve silenced them then you might have
[1:13:33] a time where you sleep so well you never
[1:13:35] wake up that's what it's like when we
[1:13:39] lose our ability to hear God's voice the
[1:13:42] ability to hear God's voice have a
[1:13:43] conscience a heart that's tendered to
[1:13:45] him is something that we should value
[1:13:46] more than anything else that is the most
[1:13:49] that's one of the most important things
[1:13:52] but people with this Con genital
[1:13:53] insensitivity to pain they can feel the
[1:13:56] difference between sharp and dull and
[1:13:58] hot and cold but they can't sense for
[1:14:00] example that they take this scalding hot
[1:14:03] coffee they can't sense that it's
[1:14:04] burning their tongue have this sense
[1:14:07] that yeah it's not cold it's not ice
[1:14:08] cubes but they can't sense that their
[1:14:10] tongue is actually being burned and
[1:14:13] injured this condition can actually lead
[1:14:15] to an accumulation of wounds over time
[1:14:18] bruises broken bones other health issues
[1:14:21] that may go undetected because you don't
[1:14:23] hear this alarm I'm in pain I'm in pain
[1:14:26] I'm in pain so you continue walking
[1:14:28] after having been on the beach and
[1:14:30] you've stepped on glass and you don't
[1:14:31] notice anything you just keep walking
[1:14:33] walking and Meanwhile your foot gets
[1:14:35] more and more injured more and more
[1:14:36] injured infection grows because you
[1:14:37] don't feel the pain we think we would
[1:14:40] love to have a world without pain we
[1:14:42] think man I'm jealous of that person's
[1:14:45] conscience because their bothers them
[1:14:47] for nothing and I get my conscience
[1:14:49] bothers about every little thing no a
[1:14:51] tender heart something very valuable and
[1:14:55] precious so um this is a this is this is
[1:14:58] a really bad condition to be in having
[1:15:01] this insensitivity to
[1:15:03] pain one of the diseases in the ancient
[1:15:06] world it wasn't well understood at the
[1:15:08] time but it was a
[1:15:10] leprosy and it was such a terrible
[1:15:13] disease because doctors now know it
[1:15:15] destroys the body's ability to sense
[1:15:18] pain and what gradually happens the
[1:15:21] muscle will weakens there'll be loss of
[1:15:23] feeling in the appendages and the person
[1:15:25] will not why do lepers sometimes have
[1:15:27] such grotesque hands such misformed
[1:15:30] hands because they've lost their
[1:15:32] sensitivity to pain here and they might
[1:15:35] be cooking around the house and have
[1:15:37] their hand there on the burner not
[1:15:38] feeling a single thing at all they've
[1:15:41] lost the ability to feel pain and that's
[1:15:44] what this accumulation of pains is what
[1:15:46] explains some of the grotesque injuries
[1:15:49] that lepers will have they might get
[1:15:50] caught they might have something get
[1:15:52] caught in their eye
[1:15:53] and we would have that sense we just
[1:15:55] kind of those tear ducts go to work it
[1:15:57] we I got some I got to get it out got to
[1:15:58] get it out they won't feel that and
[1:16:01] they'll just let that thing stay in
[1:16:03] their eye until it gets infected worse
[1:16:05] and worse and worse and that's why
[1:16:08] they'll end up going blind because
[1:16:10] they're unable to feel pain Pain's a
[1:16:13] special thing CS Le said God Whispers to
[1:16:17] us in our Pleasures he speaks in our
[1:16:19] consciences but he shouts in our pains
[1:16:23] he wants to get our attention so much he
[1:16:25] shouts in our pains and that's the very
[1:16:27] thing the devil doesn't want us to hear
[1:16:30] God's voice which is everything he can
[1:16:32] to turn down the volume on our pain so
[1:16:34] we can't hear
[1:16:36] it it's interesting that um leprosy is a
[1:16:42] type of sin in the Bible because leprosy
[1:16:45] works the very same way leprosy sin and
[1:16:49] leprosy work similarly leprosy a disease
[1:16:51] that attacks the nervous system
[1:16:53] so you your body isn't getting the
[1:16:55] messages from the brain back and forth
[1:16:56] I'm in pain that's exactly what sin does
[1:16:59] it desensitizes us so we think I'm
[1:17:01] enjoying it I'm having this pleasant
[1:17:03] experience watching this film going out
[1:17:05] with this guy listening to this music
[1:17:07] but it's actually can only enjoy it
[1:17:09] because it's gradually deadened our
[1:17:11] sense of pain and we don't we don't
[1:17:13] realize it's hurting us it's hurting us
[1:17:15] we're the devil gets us actually to
[1:17:17] enjoy the experience of being hurt by
[1:17:20] getting us to by cutting off those
[1:17:22] Messengers of
[1:17:24] pain on page four I've got a list of
[1:17:27] scriptures we can look in Malachi um
[1:17:29] this is an Old Testament example of
[1:17:32] spiritual leprosy at work on the same
[1:17:35] scal that you see on
[1:17:37] laa and you've got um in Malachi you've
[1:17:40] got I think seven different scriptures
[1:17:43] that work in parallel God makes a
[1:17:45] statement then Israel ask this question
[1:17:48] what do you mean God and it's a
[1:17:50] statement like the in Malachi 1 vers
[1:17:53] vers 2 and
[1:17:54] three God speaks to Israel I have loved
[1:17:57] you sayth the
[1:17:59] Lord yet you say wherein have you loved
[1:18:03] me what do you mean you love me God and
[1:18:06] if we translate it to our own situations
[1:18:08] it'd be like Mom or Dad tucking Us in at
[1:18:11] night saying I love you sweee and you
[1:18:12] look back what do you mean you love me
[1:18:14] Mom no you don't love me you didn't give
[1:18:17] me what I asked for Christmas you don't
[1:18:19] love me and when you look at it that way
[1:18:21] he like what is Israel saying they have
[1:18:24] no sense of what God's love is neither
[1:18:28] do we sometimes but when the but God
[1:18:31] loves when they're like so callous what
[1:18:32] do you mean you love me God I was just
[1:18:35] 70 years in Babylon how can you say you
[1:18:37] love
[1:18:38] me they've become callous they don't
[1:18:41] sense this
[1:18:42] anymore Malachi 1:7 and8 you offer
[1:18:45] polluted bread upon my Altar and you say
[1:18:49] what do you mean
[1:18:50] polluted they're supposed to give an an
[1:18:52] un unblemished lamb as a
[1:18:54] sacrifice and they're not doing that
[1:18:57] they want the unblemished lamb sell at
[1:18:58] the market to get the best price they're
[1:19:00] going to give the the lamb that's
[1:19:02] already lame to God thinking God doesn't
[1:19:04] eat my lamb anyway he's only going to be
[1:19:06] offered on the sacrifice it's a waste of
[1:19:07] a good sheep I'm going give this this
[1:19:09] this this lame one to God it's good
[1:19:11] enough for God God if it's good enough
[1:19:13] for me it better be good enough for you
[1:19:15] and this attitude you can see leprosy
[1:19:18] written all over because there's no
[1:19:20] sensitivity anymore it's all about me
[1:19:23] God I don't know where you're at but you
[1:19:25] should be more concerned about my life
[1:19:26] God they're not they've completely lost
[1:19:28] their tenderness toward
[1:19:31] God Malachi 2 you have wearied the Lord
[1:19:34] with your
[1:19:35] words kind like you have that situation
[1:19:37] with your conversation with your kids it
[1:19:39] goes on and on and on you say folks
[1:19:43] we're we'll talk about this for one more
[1:19:45] minute and then we're done what do you
[1:19:47] mean don't you have any patience Dad
[1:19:49] don't you care what I say they have no
[1:19:52] sense because say where in have we
[1:19:53] wearied him they have no sense of their
[1:19:57] own sin of their own
[1:19:59] conduct and Malachi 3:7 God says return
[1:20:03] unto me and I'll return unto you sayith
[1:20:05] the Lord but you said wherein shall we
[1:20:07] return why should we go back to Egypt
[1:20:09] why why why why why should we go back we
[1:20:11] wish we were in Egypt it was good there
[1:20:13] why would we return with you God you
[1:20:15] haven't done anything for me my life
[1:20:17] going so well I could show you all of my
[1:20:19] prayer list that nothing's happening on
[1:20:21] their God I need this I need this I need
[1:20:23] this why should I return to you it's
[1:20:26] completely leprous no sensitivity
[1:20:29] anymore to what God has
[1:20:32] done the b in the Bible leprosy is a
[1:20:35] type of sin and that is what this pryan
[1:20:38] church has like
[1:20:41] leprosy sin is a long incubation period
[1:20:45] and thanks to co we all know what an
[1:20:48] incubation period is you can have the
[1:20:51] germ you can have the V virus you can
[1:20:53] have whatever it is but it won't show
[1:20:55] up for a long long time and that
[1:20:58] incubation period is how long after
[1:21:00] contact you can still be considered to
[1:21:02] have it and show symptoms leprosy has a
[1:21:04] long incubation period you could get
[1:21:05] that bacteria and it might be years
[1:21:08] before you ever actually show symptoms
[1:21:11] of leprosy that's how it is with sin you
[1:21:14] can watch something and it just gets in
[1:21:16] your mind gets in your mind gets in your
[1:21:17] mind every now and then you'll think
[1:21:18] about it but it never comes out actually
[1:21:20] doing anything with it for you years
[1:21:23] perhaps because sin is a really long
[1:21:26] incubation period if you don't repent of
[1:21:28] that sin just want to kind of hug it let
[1:21:31] it stick around for a while it'll stick
[1:21:33] around for a nice long time it's very
[1:21:35] patient it'll wait for the perfect time
[1:21:37] to come and to come into fruition but um
[1:21:41] just kind of shows that the seemingly
[1:21:42] inconsequential decisions we make every
[1:21:44] day have a lasting impact over time our
[1:21:48] thoughts do become words gradually our
[1:21:51] words do become actions gradually those
[1:21:54] actions become habits gradually which
[1:21:56] will become our character which becomes
[1:21:58] our destiny sin is a long incubation
[1:22:01] period watch our thoughts watch our
[1:22:04] words we don't want to give the devil a
[1:22:06] handle into
[1:22:08] that but we think about this church this
[1:22:12] this
[1:22:12] desensitized Church think how could this
[1:22:17] church get into such a condition that
[1:22:18] although they're poor blind naked
[1:22:20] they're actually exalting themselves
[1:22:23] for their riches and prosperity it's a
[1:22:25] very ironic situation how does this
[1:22:28] happen and it happens because they're no
[1:22:30] longer hearing the voice of God they've
[1:22:33] lost the ability to hear God's voice
[1:22:37] they're unable to be protected by their
[1:22:39] sense of spiritual pain that ouch that
[1:22:42] we hear in our conscience is a great
[1:22:44] thing don't go past that and they hear
[1:22:48] the ouch but enough times they go past
[1:22:50] it and go on living in the pleasure of
[1:22:52] sin without realizing that those
[1:22:54] Pleasures are gradually killing them by
[1:22:57] dulling their sense of pain to them
[1:23:01] brother brand kind of tackles this
[1:23:03] question how could this happen um in a
[1:23:05] sermon called and knoweth it not and
[1:23:08] what he and he talks about how the soul
[1:23:10] he talks about Body Spirit and soul how
[1:23:13] we have an innermost man our soul where
[1:23:15] where we where where where where faith
[1:23:18] is and that's where we should that that
[1:23:20] should be our anchor our our our typo
[1:23:23] but if we're not anchored there hearing
[1:23:24] God speak and truth from our soul and
[1:23:27] we're just kind of living in our
[1:23:28] emotions then we can gradually lose the
[1:23:31] sense of actually hearing God's voice
[1:23:33] and we're not living from the inside of
[1:23:35] the inside anymore another message work
[1:23:37] his faith Express he says when it's
[1:23:39] directed from the inside from our
[1:23:41] innermost man it throws all the rest of
[1:23:43] it together that's the guidepost the
[1:23:46] control tower the inside of the inside
[1:23:48] the soul should control the spirit the
[1:23:50] spirit should control the body what
[1:23:52] leprosy does it breaks that connection
[1:23:56] so there's no clear communication
[1:23:57] anymore so you're no longer hearing that
[1:24:00] communication from the inside of the
[1:24:01] inside and just going on having a great
[1:24:04] time in the pleasures of
[1:24:07] sin he goes on to say so an outside
[1:24:10] whitewash doesn't really make any
[1:24:11] difference the religious people back
[1:24:13] there that Paul called Whited walls and
[1:24:15] so forth they were outwardly just every
[1:24:17] way a Believer they had prophecies among
[1:24:19] them everything else but the inside of
[1:24:21] the inside they weren living in faith is
[1:24:24] if the soul that disbelieves it shall
[1:24:26] die that's the reason I say people can
[1:24:28] jump up and down speak in tongues can
[1:24:30] shout like this loudan church would be
[1:24:33] doing they can lay hands on the sick
[1:24:35] heal the sick and so forth by faith all
[1:24:37] these great things they're by the spirit
[1:24:39] yet still be lost because it's not on
[1:24:42] the innermost man it's just on this
[1:24:45] realm of the spirit man on the realm of
[1:24:47] the emotions and there's no anchor there
[1:24:50] and they're living in that Realm of the
[1:24:52] emot emotions and that is completely
[1:24:54] isolating them they're no longer hearing
[1:24:56] the voice of God anymore they're just
[1:24:57] hearing what they want to hear in their
[1:24:59] emotions when you lose that sense of the
[1:25:01] voice of God your spiritual nervous
[1:25:03] system isn't working anymore and you'll
[1:25:05] be hurting yourself with actually
[1:25:06] realizing
[1:25:08] it in this message and knoweth it not he
[1:25:10] says people can live in this spirit and
[1:25:12] notice that's that Spirit man they there
[1:25:15] are are our our our emotional man our
[1:25:18] mind man they can live in this Spirit
[1:25:19] they can dance in the spirit they can be
[1:25:21] in a good atmosphere and get into it and
[1:25:23] really enjoy it they can shout in the
[1:25:25] spirit they can go to church in the
[1:25:26] spirit they can absolutely God's spirit
[1:25:29] can be moving but they just kind of get
[1:25:31] in the atmosphere and respond in the
[1:25:33] atmosphere without ever really opening
[1:25:34] their heart having a transformation on
[1:25:36] the inside and if you never goes deeper
[1:25:39] than your spirit may never actually
[1:25:40] pierces the heart you can still be lost
[1:25:43] and still enjoy a good
[1:25:44] atmosphere I can go to a basketball game
[1:25:47] and I can cheer with the best of them
[1:25:49] cheer with the best of them but if I
[1:25:51] never actually go out to the waight room
[1:25:53] and do the work and actually go and take
[1:25:55] the skills and practice and go out there
[1:25:57] and shoot with the best of them I can
[1:25:58] cheer as lot as I can get caught up in
[1:26:00] the atmosphere but I'm no better
[1:26:02] basketball player and we could actually
[1:26:04] get in the atmosphere of a service just
[1:26:06] oh we enjoy it enjoy it enjoy but if
[1:26:08] it's just the atmosphere being i' this
[1:26:11] is a great atmosphere to be in nobody's
[1:26:12] cussing me out nobody's punching me this
[1:26:15] is a good friendly place to be in but if
[1:26:17] it never goes deeper than that you can
[1:26:20] still be just as devil possessed can be
[1:26:23] because you haven't opened your heart to
[1:26:24] let that Spirit change you from the
[1:26:26] inside of the
[1:26:29] inside why you say these are good people
[1:26:32] what makes them do these things because
[1:26:34] their tie poost is on a church their
[1:26:37] anchor is a church teaching their anchor
[1:26:40] is just might what they be feeling says
[1:26:42] you remember last Sunday's sermon of the
[1:26:43] anointed ones in the last days they're
[1:26:45] anointed their second realm spirit is
[1:26:48] Anointed but that doesn't change your
[1:26:50] life I can go to the gym I can cheer
[1:26:53] with the Cleveland Cavaliers as hard as
[1:26:55] I want but that doesn't make me a better
[1:26:57] basketball player I just caught up in
[1:26:59] the atmosphere but if I actually go and
[1:27:01] I change my diet I change my routine I
[1:27:04] get exercise that will change how I am
[1:27:07] that will make me a better basketball
[1:27:09] player but not just being caught up in
[1:27:11] the
[1:27:12] atmosphere God is something much better
[1:27:15] than an atmosphere God is something much
[1:27:18] better than just doing good works of
[1:27:20] Social Gospel he wants to change
[1:27:23] us and we can think here we don't want
[1:27:27] to be just content with a nice
[1:27:29] atmosphere we don't want to be content
[1:27:32] doing good works and ah I've done a good
[1:27:34] thing today way to go that's not what we
[1:27:36] want we want to be changed from the
[1:27:38] inside of the inside where Christ
[1:27:40] identifies us he doesn't just know our
[1:27:42] works he knows us he's talked to us
[1:27:45] we've listened to him we've had
[1:27:47] Fellowship together that's so much
[1:27:48] better than just working working working
[1:27:50] for him if we want change Revelation
[1:27:53] 3:18 gives us how we can change he say I
[1:27:57] counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in
[1:28:00] the fire that th mayest be truly rich in
[1:28:04] white rment that you may be clothed that
[1:28:07] the the shame of your nakedness don't
[1:28:09] appear anoint your eyes with eyes sad
[1:28:11] that you may see as many as I love I
[1:28:15] rebuke and chasen not very many people
[1:28:18] allowed to see today like rebuking and
[1:28:20] chasing I don't really like it either
[1:28:22] but that's you know a friend who is
[1:28:25] willing to tell you the truth and
[1:28:27] correct you that's a real
[1:28:29] friend and that's what God sent when he
[1:28:31] sends a prophet God didn't send a
[1:28:34] prophet is you know what it might be
[1:28:36] think it might be a good idea to get up
[1:28:38] that you know it's getting close to work
[1:28:40] them I've got a nice breakfast would you
[1:28:42] think about getting up that's not how
[1:28:44] God approaches this it's an exclamation
[1:28:46] point behold the bride who cometh go out
[1:28:48] to meet him as many as I love I rebuke
[1:28:50] and Chas him get up here you're lazy bum
[1:28:52] it's time to leave that's the kind of
[1:28:55] language that's got to get this guy out
[1:28:57] of bed and God didn't send a theologian
[1:29:00] or Professor he sent a rugged Prophet
[1:29:02] with exclamation points of truth that
[1:29:04] might be uncomfortable at times but
[1:29:06] that's what we need as many as I love I
[1:29:09] rebuke and chasen be zealous
[1:29:12] therefore but it doesn't end there be
[1:29:15] zealous therefore and repent and
[1:29:19] change amen let's
[1:29:27] pray this is the we've talked about the
[1:29:30] culture that we live in a lot this
[1:29:33] loudan culture where we have a busy
[1:29:35] church and it's completely acceptable
[1:29:36] just to be busy and being able to hear
[1:29:40] something and respond oh that's
[1:29:41] interesting that's almost respectable
[1:29:44] response lukewarmness has become
[1:29:47] respectable but God wants something
[1:29:49] better than that amen we don't want to
[1:29:52] just be talking about all that do focus
[1:29:54] on ourselves actually listening to what
[1:29:57] God has to
[1:30:00] say and it can be so so easy to become
[1:30:05] desensitized to God's spirit we we see
[1:30:08] so many things in the news see so many
[1:30:10] things on our news feeds it can be so
[1:30:15] desensitizing and Lord I just pray that
[1:30:17] you would help us father not to be a
[1:30:18] busy church not to be a lukewarm church
[1:30:21] but to be a church that
[1:30:24] listens and wants to change and live
[1:30:27] that live according to your word not
[1:30:29] just to talk about it but actually live
[1:30:31] that life Lord I pray that you would
[1:30:34] Lord create in us a greater care oh God
[1:30:37] that we care that your word is like our
[1:30:40] oxygen that we really want with all of
[1:30:43] our hearts Lord I pray that fellowship
[1:30:46] and communion with you that would be
[1:30:49] more of our prayer life and not just our
[1:30:51] prayer
[1:30:53] list amen Lord we pray sometimes father
[1:30:56] help me just have a good day may you all
[1:30:58] work all things good
[1:30:59] today our idea of good might be very
[1:31:02] much different from your idea of good
[1:31:04] Lord I pray that we would Lord value our
[1:31:07] our helplessness help us to be conscious
[1:31:09] of our helplessness oh God lord I can
[1:31:12] remember we've prayed for sister Sharon
[1:31:14] over the last uh six months and we hear
[1:31:17] this diagnosis oh how helpless we feel
[1:31:20] we can't do anything about this just
[1:31:22] pray and pray we're aware of that and
[1:31:25] it's so good when we aware of our need
[1:31:29] our inability to change anything that we
[1:31:31] call upon you we there is prayer there
[1:31:33] is need and there can be praise we are
[1:31:35] aware of you in our midst I thank you
[1:31:37] for that Lord I pray that you would help
[1:31:39] us restore oh Lord our sensitivity to
[1:31:42] you oh God Lord help us not to walk over
[1:31:45] our conscience every single day but to
[1:31:49] listen and value that tender heart
[1:31:52] Lord I pray that if some ways that uh
[1:31:56] that this rebuke of this laan church and
[1:31:58] this
[1:32:00] description it can fit us very easily
[1:32:02] just because it's the culture we live in
[1:32:04] Lord I pray Lord that we would buy of
[1:32:07] you that real
[1:32:09] gold Lord that we would get that
[1:32:11] reignment that isn't The Emperor's New
[1:32:12] Clothes but these are true garments of
[1:32:15] righteousness Lord I pray oh Father you
[1:32:18] would anoint our eyes with Isa that we
[1:32:20] could see in
[1:32:22] truth Lord that we would be
[1:32:25] zealous not just zealous in the
[1:32:27] emotional realm but actually
[1:32:29] repent Lord I pray oh Father you would
[1:32:33] you would change our lives father help
[1:32:36] us father to live Godly and honestly
[1:32:39] before you Lord there have been places
[1:32:41] that we've just father compromised and
[1:32:45] and not done what you've asked us to do
[1:32:46] Lord may we go back say father forgive
[1:32:48] me I should have done this or that I'm
