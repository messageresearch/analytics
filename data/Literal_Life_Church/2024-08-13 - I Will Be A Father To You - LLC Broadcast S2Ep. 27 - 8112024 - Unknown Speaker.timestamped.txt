[3:47] Corinthians chapter 6 if you turn with
[3:49] me and would just read this portion of
[3:51] scripture starting at verse 14 be ye not
[3:54] unequally yolked together with
[3:57] unbelievers for what Fellowship hath
[3:59] right ousness with unrighteousness what
[4:02] communion hath light with darkness and
[4:05] what Concord hath Christ with baale and
[4:08] what part hath he that believeth with an
[4:11] Infidel so the Lord is calling for a
[4:13] separation here because you have to
[4:15] realize if you are saying you have Light
[4:17] Within you you can only go so far in a
[4:20] union and a fellowship with someone who
[4:22] don't have light this is not to make us
[4:24] better but this is God calls for a
[4:26] separation from Darkness God calls calls
[4:29] for separation from friendships that is
[4:32] unequally yolked God calls for that can
[4:35] you say amen and what Concord that
[4:37] Christ with Baal what part he that
[4:39] believeth with an Infidel and what
[4:41] agreement hath the temple of God with
[4:43] Idols for ye are the Temple of the
[4:45] Living God ha go as God has said I will
[4:48] dwell in them and walk in them he
[4:50] doesn't dwell in Idols he dwells in men
[4:53] Sons and Daughters of God I will dwell
[4:55] in them and walk in them and I will be
[4:57] their God and they shall be my people
[5:01] wherefore come out come out from among
[5:04] them and be ye separate sayith the Lord
[5:07] and touch not the unclean things so the
[5:10] association or the blending of something
[5:13] that's not you has a potential of you
[5:15] touching the wrong things in your life
[5:18] touching something unclean come out of
[5:21] that touch not the unclean thing and I
[5:24] will receive you and this is the part
[5:25] that I want to get to when you come out
[5:27] of that when you're willing to come out
[5:29] really feel the call hear the call and
[5:32] when you're willing to come out guess
[5:34] who's waiting to receive you God said
[5:36] I'll receive
[5:38] you and I will be a father to
[5:44] you because I think when you take the
[5:47] painful journey of coming out of all
[5:49] that you're going to need a father to
[5:52] guide
[5:54] you you don't need a
[5:56] dictator can you say Amen am but you
[5:59] need a father and he says I will be a
[6:01] father unto you and ye shall be my sons
[6:04] and daughters sayith the Lord Almighty
[6:08] to say the words that I will be a father
[6:10] to you it's pretty personal it's pretty
[6:13] intimate um it it it's it's not
[6:16] something coming from a system or a
[6:19] denomination or uh something that would
[6:22] be insensitive or something that's not a
[6:24] feeling but when you use the term of
[6:27] Father and Sons and Daughters you're
[6:29] talking about a family you're talking
[6:31] about one of the most intimate things
[6:33] that you can have because we all have
[6:35] our families and so God is being very
[6:38] close to uh by saying this word and if
[6:42] God could just drop in our hearts this
[6:45] morning sitting here the significance of
[6:48] when he says to us I will be a father to
[6:52] you I just pray that drops in your heart
[6:55] because most of us in this generation do
[6:59] not not have the greatest image of a
[7:01] father matter of fact every Father Here
[7:04] is in all that his his strengths he has
[7:08] flaws he's not the perfect father I know
[7:10] that every man in here if they raise a
[7:12] hand and say I'm not a perfect father
[7:14] but there is a perfect heavenly father
[7:17] and the reason that we have it is
[7:18] there's a craving within us to have a
[7:21] father guide us and to have a true
[7:23] father and God says to your life today I
[7:26] don't care who you are I want to be a
[7:29] father to you in a generation that most
[7:33] did not have a good image of a father he
[7:36] says I will be a father to your life and
[7:40] so he doesn't say here that I I will be
[7:43] go a God to you uh because that's more
[7:47] distant how many knows what the meaning
[7:49] to God is God just means an object of
[7:52] worship and so God can be God to us but
[7:55] he doesn't say here I will be God to you
[7:57] because that is a more distant
[7:59] relationship this what he says when I'll
[8:01] be a father is more relational it it's
[8:04] it's it's closer can you say Amen it's
[8:06] not just he's this distant object of
[8:09] worship that we get on our needs and we
[8:11] bow before him and we worship him but
[8:13] he's a distant God matter of fact I've
[8:15] said this before matter of fact the
[8:17] world actually likes a God that's
[8:21] distant how many know that they don't
[8:24] want a God that's personal and gets in
[8:25] their personal life they don't want a
[8:27] God that lives in their home by his
[8:29] presence they haven't invited a god like
[8:31] that so they create their own God that
[8:33] they can do what they want in their
[8:35] lives but they can still go to church
[8:37] and worship him I'll tell you I don't
[8:38] want to serve a god like that I don't
[8:40] want my God distant I want him to be a
[8:43] supernatural God in my life every day
[8:46] guiding me in every decision that I make
[8:49] and if he has to correct me of son I'd
[8:51] rather have my correction from the
[8:52] heavenly father than anyone else because
[8:55] I know he does it for loving his heart
[8:57] towards me so people would say I don't
[9:00] want to God that distant I mean I
[9:02] remember B Midler she wrot she wrote a
[9:04] song or she sang a song it was at the
[9:05] top of the church in the world from a
[9:07] distance God is watching us and it was
[9:10] such a uh it was a tear jerker it just
[9:12] moved your heart that they could be
[9:13] singing from a distance God is watching
[9:18] us God is watching us God is watching us
[9:24] from a distance and it was warm and
[9:27] fuzzy and everybody cried and oh oh God
[9:30] is watching us from a distance and I
[9:33] just sang A secular song in church and
[9:34] I'm going to get in
[9:38] trouble please don't be offended at that
[9:40] but I'm songs in the world tell where
[9:43] they're at and they don't want a God
[9:45] that's a supernatural God living with
[9:47] you every day and God involved in your
[9:50] life they don't want a god they create
[9:51] their own Jesus they create their own
[9:55] God and they want him to be distant
[9:59] but this is not the God we serve this is
[10:01] a God that's a personal God if you're
[10:04] listening online today or wherever
[10:05] you're listening on the broadcast God
[10:07] had a family from the beginning God
[10:10] predestinated a world of Sons and
[10:12] Daughters of God God has a family God
[10:16] has an
[10:18] offspring God has his own Sons and
[10:21] Daughters just like fathers this morning
[10:23] have their own Sons and Daughters God
[10:25] has Offspring God has sons and daughters
[10:30] and he had him in his mind before the
[10:31] foundation of the
[10:33] world God has an offspring he was the
[10:37] first
[10:38] father the term father was created by
[10:41] God himself none of us know how to do
[10:45] the father thing right without catching
[10:48] a proper image of the heavenly father
[10:52] and so you need a revelation that he is
[10:54] your father that he says I'm your father
[10:56] but here he says I will be a father to
[10:59] you and you will be my sons I will be a
[11:02] father and you might draw a quick lesson
[11:05] that there's a difference in just having
[11:07] children to give you the title of father
[11:11] or being a father to those children
[11:15] right right God says I'll be a father to
[11:19] you whatever a father means I'm going to
[11:22] be that to you I'm going to supply that
[11:24] need in your life I'm not just distant
[11:27] saying that I'm your you know I'm your
[11:28] father you're my son no I want to be a
[11:31] father I want to be Hands-On I want to
[11:34] be give you guidance can you say Amen
[11:36] but here he says I want to be a father
[11:38] to you and so you have to look at these
[11:40] words uh before now as we look at the
[11:43] context here of 2 Corinthians and we
[11:45] look at what Paul was talking about as I
[11:47] said he's calling for a separation Paul
[11:50] is ministering and calling for a
[11:52] separation how many knows that God calls
[11:55] for separations in our
[11:57] lives God called for separation in our
[12:00] Father Abraham from his Kindred from his
[12:02] people and and and he could not move on
[12:05] to the blessings until he separated
[12:07] himself from his Kindred he said I I'm
[12:09] calling you into another land and so he
[12:11] shook hands politely with all of his
[12:13] family members and said I love you and I
[12:16] I never lack loving you matter of fact
[12:18] he never lost his love for lot he never
[12:20] lost his love for a family he prayed for
[12:22] them he was the only one that was
[12:24] praying when lot was getting ready to
[12:25] come under judgment the only one praying
[12:27] for his family members was
[12:30] Lot may God help us never to give up on
[12:33] our family members may God help us to
[12:36] never give up on a wayward son or a
[12:38] daughter may we continue to bring him
[12:40] Before the Throne of God may you never
[12:42] give up on that husband may you never
[12:44] give up on that wife sometimes you're
[12:46] the only hope that they have is that
[12:48] you're bringing their name before the
[12:50] throne and Abraham's lot's Only Hope was
[12:54] Abraham praying for the Deliverance of
[12:56] lot so he loved him when he shook hands
[12:58] with him and said listen I'm going God
[13:00] is calling me out I've got to go there
[13:02] had to be a separation and how many know
[13:04] there was fighting between lot's
[13:06] herdsman and Abraham's heardman tension
[13:08] was in the camp and nobody really knew
[13:11] what the tension was all about but God
[13:13] come down and says it's time for you to
[13:14] separate time for you to move on God
[13:17] bless you lot I've got to go my we got
[13:19] to go our separate
[13:21] ways God calls for separations in our
[13:25] lives and now I could do another hour
[13:27] sermon on what he calls for separations
[13:30] from and you'd be very
[13:34] surprised praise the
[13:37] Lord because if God knows you have he
[13:39] has something better in mind for you
[13:42] then he calls for a
[13:43] separation how may believe that
[13:45] Christians are called to separate from
[13:47] the things of the
[13:49] world that's basic you say well I want
[13:52] to be a Christian but I want all this
[13:53] worldly stuff no no God calls for a
[13:55] separation does he do it to be mean to
[13:57] you no he has it because he's got
[14:00] something better in mind for you and
[14:02] anybody that can go through the pain of
[14:04] laying things down I'm through with this
[14:06] I'm done with this as of this day I'm
[14:08] finished with this God I love you more
[14:11] than I love this habit I love you more
[14:14] and I'm I'm looking forward to what you
[14:15] have for me better than I do this habit
[14:17] so today I'm laying it down I'm
[14:20] separating from it because I love you
[14:23] more than this worldly thing that's when
[14:25] we're talking about setting you up for a
[14:27] candidate for the Holy Ghost and
[14:29] everybody here needs the Holy Ghost it's
[14:31] the oil can you say Amen five virgins
[14:34] didn't have oil they were Christians but
[14:36] they didn't have oil and five had oil
[14:38] and when the call came to go out then
[14:40] they were caught up in a Rapture only
[14:42] for one thing all of them were good
[14:43] Christians but one had five hat
[14:46] oil and if we want to set ourselves for
[14:49] a candidate to receive the spirit of God
[14:50] you can do it this morning by coming to
[14:52] an altar in your heart are coming to
[14:54] this alt say I am through and finished
[14:56] with the things of the world because I
[14:57] know what God has for me me is better
[15:00] than what I'm holding on to somebody
[15:02] ought to say praise the Lord God calls
[15:04] for separation from things of the world
[15:07] God calls from separation from friends
[15:10] that are not doing you very well God
[15:13] calls for a
[15:15] separation not that he hates you but
[15:17] that he loves
[15:19] you oh he calls us away from his
[15:24] separation from false unions the wrong
[15:26] Fellowship this is what Paul's talking
[15:27] about you can't be unequally Yol with
[15:30] somebody you can't be unequally Yol you
[15:34] can't claim Christianity and claim to
[15:39] pornography it doesn't work that way you
[15:42] can't you you you can't form close
[15:46] relationships that are unions that are
[15:48] unequal with where you want to go
[15:50] unequally yoke is to to uh oxes that are
[15:53] trying to go separate ways they can't go
[15:55] forward at all you see it's an unequal
[15:58] Yol or the different weight is a
[16:00] different thing and so you know all
[16:01] about that but you can't you can't be
[16:03] unequally yolked false unions the wrong
[16:05] Fellowship touching an unclean thing an
[16:08] unequal yoke then listen now when you
[16:11] are I wish I had another hour on that
[16:13] but listen now I'm going to be short so
[16:15] you need to really listen to everything
[16:16] I'm saying is that when God calls for a
[16:19] separation and you're willing to do it
[16:21] it's going to be
[16:24] painful your life is going to hurt a
[16:26] little bit your flesh is going to feel
[16:28] feel the pain your flesh is going to
[16:33] resist because remember this flesh
[16:35] doesn't ever want to serve God never
[16:38] will want to serve God this flesh cannot
[16:41] inherit the kingdom of God your mind has
[16:44] to be G brought under subjection because
[16:46] your mind doesn't want to serve God
[16:48] that's right the only hope is the Holy
[16:50] Ghost brings this body under subjection
[16:52] and said listen you're going to go and
[16:54] do what the Holy Ghost tells me to do
[16:57] not what my flesh says but if the
[16:58] painful thing God calls for a separation
[17:01] I wonder if the emotions hurt Abraham as
[17:04] he's shaking hands with lot and saying
[17:06] I've got to go God's called me to
[17:07] something here and I've got to separate
[17:09] but emotionally family members
[17:11] separating that's a tough thing it plays
[17:14] on our emotions but there has to be
[17:17] something deeper than emotional
[17:22] friendships that friendship is not based
[17:25] on something solid it it's just a
[17:28] shallow Rel relationship and there has
[17:30] to be something deeper in your
[17:33] life that if God calls our separation
[17:36] the emotions might hold you together I
[17:38] think of a a young guy and young girl
[17:40] and there's no solid base for them to be
[17:42] together as boyfriend and girlfriend or
[17:43] for a marriage it's just an emotional or
[17:46] it's sexual or fleshly it's just there's
[17:48] there's no God in it at all it's just an
[17:50] emotional attachment or or sexual
[17:53] attachment I can tell you you have no
[17:55] foundation for a marriage can you say
[17:58] Amen you're setting yourself up for
[18:00] failure but when two people get the Holy
[18:02] Ghost they got the foundation something
[18:05] to start
[18:06] on then when they connect emotionally
[18:10] then eventually after their wedding day
[18:12] they connect sexually then all that has
[18:14] meaning to
[18:15] it because you have a foundation to
[18:18] build off
[18:23] of sometimes God calls for separations
[18:26] and it's
[18:27] painful and maybe that's why if he says
[18:31] come out of her my people come out of
[18:34] all that separate you're you're my
[18:37] people you're my sons and daughters
[18:39] you're not that you're
[18:41] this and it hurts so bad to come away
[18:45] maybe that's why he's at the other side
[18:48] saying you know what I'm here waiting
[18:50] for
[18:52] you can you say
[18:55] Amen it's kind of like a breakup
[19:00] when we come out of a breakup we're
[19:04] missing things we're feeling bad we're
[19:06] feeling a void we're feeling hurt how
[19:08] many girls have ever had a breakup and
[19:11] you go through those days of feeling
[19:15] aoid you feeling something's
[19:18] missing you feel
[19:21] hurt
[19:23] humans keep forming bad
[19:25] relationship and then breakup after
[19:28] breakup after breakup and they get
[19:30] harder and harder cuz they keep forming
[19:32] bad
[19:34] relationships all right you can get
[19:36] quiet on me that's fine I know I'm
[19:39] telling the truth I know this is
[19:41] scriptural I know this is true from
[19:43] evidence and none of us are exempt from
[19:47] the human feeling of a breakup or a
[19:49] cutting off of a wrong friendship or a
[19:51] wrong relationship none of us are immune
[19:53] for not feeling
[19:57] that and it leaves a void it leaves
[20:00] something missing but I'm here to tell
[20:02] you if he's waiting at the other end of
[20:04] it he's ready to be a father to you and
[20:07] feel what you're missing in your
[20:10] life can you say Amen our Lord the
[20:13] heavenly father he's ready to be a
[20:15] father to
[20:19] you why do we have all these breakups
[20:22] and a a a divorc world and why do we
[20:25] have this it's an adulterous world yes
[20:28] it is it's an adulterous
[20:32] generation it's an adulterous world that
[20:34] destroys true Healthy
[20:37] Families It's a cruel world it kills us
[20:40] inside it kills families it kills
[20:42] marriage relationships it's it's shallow
[20:45] relationships and so but it kills it's
[20:47] an adulterous re uh generation and so
[20:51] you have this whole thing that I could

[21:06] relationships ones that aren't committed
[21:08] ones ones that fail can you say
[21:11] Amen just it's all full of because an
[21:13] adulter adultery is something that a man
[21:16] would go with another M woman and not
[21:18] keep his commitment to his wife and so
[21:20] he goes with another one the woman goes
[21:22] with another man it's an adulterous
[21:23] generation that's why we have the
[21:25] divorce is because it's adulterous it's
[21:28] it's not committed can you say Amen it's
[21:30] lacking these true strong
[21:34] bonds and when you have now 50 60 70 80
[21:38] years I'll just put that timeline on it

[22:28] that loves you that will not give up on

[22:36] down but would stay with you and be
[22:38] committed to you and love you can you

[22:43] life or you're going to get hurt in the

[24:10] father who's committed to you a father
[24:13] who went to the cross for you can you
[24:15] say Amen a father who sacrificed his
[24:17] life for
[24:20] you you make the choice but it's a
[24:23] broken world and you can't find any
[24:25] stability out there you find instability
[24:29] in emotions and sometimes even in the
[24:31] church if you choose the wrong
[24:33] relationships and you'll find songs to
[24:35] sing along with it Sons and Daughters of
[24:38] God to come in the church today and
[24:40] raise their hands freely and I don't
[24:42] have to get in between you and your
[24:44] relationship with God that you can raise
[24:46] your hand and say you know what church
[24:47] is about today it's not coming and
[24:49] watching other people at the church it's
[24:51] not depending on just the friendships in
[24:53] a church praise the Lord if get
[24:55] friendships but I don't come to this
[24:56] church and bring my family and do this
[24:59] because I'm depending on whether you
[25:00] like me or not I come to fellowship with
[25:03] the father and worship him I come to get
[25:05] a better relationship can I get an amen
[25:08] this morning this is the reason why we
[25:10] come to a church are they preaching the
[25:12] word and can I come into relationship
[25:15] with the heavenly father because I
[25:16] believe I'm a son and if I'm a son I
[25:19] want to hear from my father this morning
[25:21] somebody say praise the Lord that's what
[25:23] a church should be can you say Amen it's
[25:26] not who's the biggest church it's not
[25:27] who's got all the singing and the music
[25:29] that's all a sesh can you say Amen it's
[25:32] about are you in a relationship with
[25:35] this
[25:37] father glory be to God I think of the
[25:40] prodical son and it said speaks
[25:42] everything of the Revival of today some
[25:45] brothers asked me a few weeks ago what's
[25:46] the final Revival I took the prodical
[25:48] son because you know what the prodical
[25:50] son he's out there messing his life up
[25:52] doing all this stuff the Elder son he
[25:54] actually got critical cuz he's doing his
[25:56] duty and doing everything right and this
[25:58] guy he spins his inheritance he runs
[26:00] away and when the prodical son came to
[26:02] him himself I've got to go back he had
[26:05] no intentions of having a relationship
[26:07] with the father he just wanted to go
[26:09] back like a servant he said cuz I was
[26:10] eating better there I was doing better
[26:13] and so I'll go in in humility and repent
[26:16] and say listen I just want to work in
[26:18] the barn I just want to work in the
[26:20] manure I know that I have ruined my
[26:22] place as a son even though I am a son
[26:25] I've ruined that I'm not coming so he
[26:27] comes in hum
[26:28] and he starts to walk towards his father
[26:30] in humility and his father his father
[26:33] starts running towards
[26:37] him bring the fatted calf let's start a
[26:42] celebration let's start a
[26:44] Revival what's the Revival about Sons
[26:47] coming back into relationship with the
[26:49] father I didn't have a good home life I
[26:52] didn't have a good domestic life I
[26:54] suffer all the time because of it
[26:56] there's a family breakup all the time
[26:58] seems like taking place but I can hold
[27:00] to an anchor this morning I have a
[27:02] father he knows my
[27:04] name somebody ought to praise this the
[27:07] Lord this morning for the Revelation
[27:10] that if everything breaks up I have a
[27:13] father who will never leave me one of
[27:16] the greatest downfalls of this nation
[27:18] number one is to leave the word of God
[27:21] but second of all when that happens
[27:22] fatherhood is
[27:24] broken and we're heading towards a
[27:26] figure of 50% of children children
[27:28] without a father figure in their life
[27:31] and then a bunch more who have a father
[27:33] figure who's abusing them and when you
[27:37] have that for 50 60 years however been
[27:39] longer than that you have a breakdown of
[27:42] the entire world and men in prison 80%
[27:45] of men in prison did not have a good
[27:47] relationship with their father or didn't
[27:49] have a father and it has fruits that
[27:51] come from
[27:53] it and in that
[27:56] generation of this downfall
[27:59] there's
[28:01] Redemption because I can tell you if you
[28:03] didn't have a good one he's standing
