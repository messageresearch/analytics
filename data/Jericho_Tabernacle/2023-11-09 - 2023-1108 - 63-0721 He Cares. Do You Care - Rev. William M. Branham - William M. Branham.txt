e e e e USA Mar br Indiana norica now this morning just uh prior to the prayer for the sick uh we are going to read some of God's word which we know that without this word it's impossible there's nothing can be done and only the word can produce uh these blessings that we're asking for the sick and the needy and I want to read some now from first Peter the 5th chapter beginning with the first verse and then from the book of Hebrews I want to read Hebrews 2 uh 2- 4 the elders which are among you I exal whom am also an elder and a witness of the suffering of Christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed feed the flock of God which is among you take the oversight thereof not by constraint but willing ly not for filthy lucer but of a ready mind neither as being Lords over God's Heritage but being examples to the and when the chief Shepherd shall appear ye shall receive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away likewise ye younger submit yourselves on to the Elder yay all of you be subject one to another and be not clo and be clothed with humility for God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he careth for you and in Hebrews the 2 chapter we read these words now I'm pulling for giving for a text cast in your care I'm my text is he cares do you care want to read this portion now while you're turning to Hebrews 2 that you might see the the real meaning of these words what the what this text means therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip for if the words spoken by Angels were was stud fast and every transgression and Disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first begin to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him God also bearing witness with both with signs and wonders and diverse Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will ttif [Music] I want to use the subject here of he cares and do you when he was sh on Earth he cared for the people the thought of it rises in my mind just before speaking or praying for the sick not knowing just what kind of a of a prayer line that we'll have uh uh first to approach this the audience must must be Anointed with faith you if you do not have faith then there's there's no need of even coming to be prayed for because it's going to take your faith and my faith together my faith to believe him your faith to believe him so we don't forget this now as we go along we've got to have something evidently with evidence I mean that we can base our faith upon what we're trying to do because if a man approaches anything that he wants to do without sufficient Faith he's bound to be a failure but if he can approach it with sufficient Faith then he's Bound To Succeed if it is according to God's Will and purpose to do it now I was thinking of him caring last evening somehow Strangely I was led by the Holy Spirit when I was waiting on some fellas to come to help brother wood to put a a trailer he had build on the back of his [Music] truck I didn't know why I was trying to find my good friend brother Evans and I went started up the highway which my wife and family setting back here knows it to be true and somehow Strangely I turned around and went back to a place a motel oh how it thrilled my heart to see so many my friends gathered there in about two minutes time till it clogged the pathway the cars couldn't pass to no more just real friends driving for hundreds of miles from Georgia and Tennessee and and Alabama and all around just the the he a service [Music] then that that thought come on my mind then what should I say to those people knowing that in the day of judgment I have to answer for what I tell them and I too am a am a lover of this great life that is to come and I I want to be [Music] there and then Strangely I went to a place where I made a odd turn instead of turning around there I went up to make a turn the lights flashed on I love L couples on the outside two fine young ladies that i' just married to two fine young Min fenals and Satan W seen the the minister one of them his ministry being said and he took a a life's companion right here this altar it went away happily on the honeymoon and and the enemy jumped on to this young man and I'm saying this to express what I'm saying does he care somehow with faith that would not take no they turned and returned back here knowing actually it was all way over in way in the East here somewhere on their honeymoon returned back and was sitting waiting and I walked in fine handsome young man his wife sitting on the outside crying her and their little companion and the other man and the other brother coming running which is a friend to this young man saying oh brother brandom such and such has happened went there and seen this handsome young man sitting there just in the peak of his life a leader of young man sitting there in the Satan he never noticed but I tuck my hand left to shake hands with his hand right to see if some disease had plagued him but there was no sign of vibration coming right out of the room from praying and fasting and waiting upon the Lord the anointing of the Holy Spirit was there that's why it l us see and then seing this Shadow Of Darkness over him I never said what I was doing but in less than a couple of moments time it was all gone the coldness of his hands had left he was shouting and praising God few minutes to find themselves in here they set right here this morning sitting in the audience see how Satan was trying to upset that young man by referring to him as some complex to be built back which the Holy Spirit knew and uh seen it by the vision of the Lord but God cared for that man God cared for that young boy just coming in a few moments ago a lady I see her sitting here in the aisle with no or just got her seat somewhere and sat down she said nine years brother brandom I've tried to get a hold of you and she said I'm so desperate here late and couldn't even get a prayer card to be in the line Billy of course it's his orders to see that I'm not bothered take me in and out don't feel hard at Billy he's commanded by this Board of Trustees to do that and if you didn't I wouldn't be able to get to the prayer line and get in here you realize that see there's got to be a system to whatever we're doing we we got to have it think but him saying come on Daddy Hurry Up This the lady moved back and she said brother Bram just a word with you standing there a vision broke over this fine looking young woman and seeing that her heart was burdened you're trying to work and make a living and a great thing happened back way back in the time of her parents that had caused this great thing to happen to her and the Lord Jesus revealed and and showed what it was and there in a moment time took it from the [Music] woman she went around rejoicing and our sitting here in the audience with us now rejoicing with tears that she's wiping her eyes now knowing that the truth of the thing was made known and that why that poor little neurotic woman that was so nervous she didn't know what to do with herself and thinking that she was gone and there was no Holy Spirit and this is her last day she tried for nine years and she's about at the end of Despair God cared for that little woman who no one cares for amen hallelujah quite a time he does care what he was share on Earth is to say he cared for the people so much till he healed their sick comforted their hearts told them about a a place that where he would go and prepare for them and would come again to receive them unto himself he cared for them and notice he cared so much until when he he know he must leave in order to bring this great thing to us he said I'll not leave you comfortless but I will send the Holy Spirit and he shall continue my care for you until he returns there's no one cares like Jesus knowing that his body as a high priest in the meteor work that he's doing now that body must be in the presence of God at all times for intercession that God cannot see the sinner sin he sees only the blood of his own son and knowing that he sent back the Holy Spirit to continue to comfort his people does he care sir certainly he cares now he was to continue to care for the people his people here on Earth in the same manner that he cared for him when he was here because he said in St John the 15th chapter if you want to make I've got notes laning Here with these scripture here's where I'm referring to St John 1526 and 27 I see many of you wrri the scriptures down so I may refer to this if you don't know it many times to the scripture I write the scripture down then I know what I'm speaking of from here because it's always in the word of the Lord see he said when the Holy Spirit has come who the father would s in his name he would testify of him in other words he would do the same thing he did the Holy Spirit working through a tabernacle that he had Sanctified would do the same thing that he [Music] did now what that ought to do do for us then we know that right among us today we have the same comforting Lord Jesus in the form of the Holy Ghost another office that God himself is working in he was a comfort to Israel when they could look up and see the pillar of fire and he the prophets speak the words that was true and God Vindicated that was their comfort he was a comfort when he was here on Earth as a man God made flesh God representing himself and expressing himself through a a man Christ Jesus who promised that the works that I do shall you do also now I'm going to the father and go to back the Holy Spirit which will be me and spirit farm and I'll be with you and dwell in you and the very same things that I've have done here the holy spirit will do again in my name when he comes that's why he said to speak against that now after the atonements already made was unpardonable sin to blaspheme the holy go and he would do it in the same way so that we would know whether it was a comfort from some uh Earthly standpoint whether we know it was a comfort from some elders person who could put their arms around us and hug us a little and make us feel good or are some theological term of a denomination that would say now you belong to us and we got it and don't belong to the rest of them because they haven't he made this directly sure see he will speak in my name the works that I do will you do also when he's upon you see he would comfort in the same way by forgiving all of our sins healing all of our sicknesses and speaking to us of comfort of the Kingdom that is to come see proving himself among us as God proved himself Among Us by Jesus Christ and in and second timoth 1 Timothy 3:16 it's written this way no about God without controversy we realize that great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifested in the flesh we saw God in flesh [Music] that was God's comfort to know that he Cal so much he cared for us until he become one of us God manifested In the Flesh not just another person but God himself and now to make it another step closer he SS the Holy Spirit to care for our Comforts and he abides in us oh he does [Music] care oh now we must go on to another portion of script scripture here or another thought to back this up before I go I might say this everybody doesn't have this comforter they they don't they don't have it so the reason they don't have it is because they don't accept it it's for them but they don't accept it now I hope that you're spiritual enough to to read what I'm saying see I'm speaking to a group of people has to be prayed for in a few minutes and we have this comfort in Holy Spirit that's sent far the comforter but all people won't receive that they don't believe in it they in order to do that then they uh together their comfort from some other resource some other means if they don't accept God's provided comforter then they have to get some other comforter see because you can't live without something to live and I hope that each of you get that especially you people has to be prayed for that's so uncomfortable this morning with maybe troubles that the doctors cannot touch we believe that doctors help people I believe that God heals by medicine God heals by surgery God heals by understanding God heals by love just a little love goes a long way let somebody be all upset and just show them you care for see God heals by love God heals by prayer God heals by Miracles God heals by his word God heals whatever Source it is God heals by it's God that heals for he said I the Lord that Health all thy diseases do so all of it should work together and man and different Ministry should work together far that now but they don't do it because sometimes they're forbidden to take certain stands upon God's word because their certain uh denominations doesn't permit them to do that but that doesn't stop the truth just the same God goes on healing just the same so they try to draw comfort from some other resource let's speak first of the Soul we find out that many people try to find Comfort by drinking you know we have a saying which is pretty well known among us today that that many ministers drink sometime before going to the pull pit take a a a good heavy drink of intoxication it's been known to seeing ministers on the platform that even staggered under the influence of liquor and uh that that ought not be it should not be is because uh many times we might condemn the man when maybe we ought not do that we ought to find back what's the trouble many of them was converted from alcohol and we find out if they are in that condition it's a disgrace and a reproach but no more a reproach it would be to lie steal or lust after women or any other thing that's in the Commandment see and maybe a man's Born High passioned and he sees these modern strip teases on the street and he he constantly in trouble see he uh that the man is born like that now what he ought to do the minister that drinks or the or the woman that smokes or dresses immorally trying to draw her a comfort from being so well put together that she wants to cause uh man to look at her there's no other reason she is partially insane see no sensible woman would no to strip herself before man who has her right mind see there's no reason for it at Allen and she uh but she's trying to these young girls today would go out on the street they're real uh well you excuse expression and remember this tape don't only just to this people here it goes around the world see and um a woman that would uh take her clothes off from her for she knows it's hotter walk out there in the sun naked and then walk out with some clothes on which is the coolest the Indians down there in the papos and navajos the papos especially of the reservation those women come out with big yarn blankets around them and set out there in the sun to keep cool why they perspire in the wind that blows sets up an air conditioning you see and uh these women have no other reason but just they don't know it they don't realize it I'm not saying that they do many of them are fine women and I'm not saying it to be rude I'm saying it to to try to to to wake them up see it's only Satan see you realize the other sect the male sect looking upon such give such an influence to them till they'll they'll squeak their tires and whistle the the wolf whistle and and uh what do they do that far the women does it in order to get the man to do that what how do you get out right In the Heat of the day and 4:00 in the afternoon to mow the grass when people are coming from their work and things like that it shows it's a spirit of insanity I know many of might have IQ a million miles higher than mine but I test your IQ with God's word and see where it comes out see that's modern IQ but the very evidence and fruits of the life Pro so they try to find comfort with that many of them say well I don't do that but you so dress themselves in such an appeal till they try to be more modern and the woman go to set by them in church the next morning wear a better hat or a little better clothes because you can afford to do it much us said Lord see see sin reaches way down and uh they try to find Comfort by doing so and they have it's become such a thing until it's absolutely struck the nation in whole not only the nation but the world in whole many things I could say here but to save time the healing service coming up I I could speak at large on this but I won't I'm sure you'll understand what I mean this uh uh it struck the political world the political life the social life the moral life of the nation of the peoples around the world it's got to a place the man wants to be a politician just to have the name of being a politician got plenty of money can pull votes and hire Machin means to do it and and so forth Just for the name and worth millions and millions of dollars see just for the name of being some great politician enough has said it that you know what I'm talking about [Music] and social life that people try to get together in this insane social life don't tell me the world's not insane doing the way it's doing it sure is it's an erotic world and by the grace of God was only only way we'll Escape it notice in this social life the people has come to a place that they they socialize little Clans and they get into there and think we're better than the next group see and it's just done that way it's the morals it's hit the morals of people until honest friends I don't even believe that the world the word moral is recognized among 90% of the people of this nation they don't even know what the world the word moral means it's is escaped from him and it's done it so trickery [Music] Satan is very subtle see and he does it so easy so so subtle just a little teeny bit here and a little there let it he's got plenty of time so he just runs a little bit in here and a little bit in here and the first thing you know the people just gradually move into it what would have happened of a woman uh back when I was a boy of 16 years old if she walk down the street like she does today in this strip teas Farm while they' have had her in jail well if it was wrong then it's wrong now see but you see Satan just begin to cut off the skirts and to lower them down and and it'll come to pass that there's somebody will Design One a little beyond the minini or what you call a thing to a fig Leaf you remember that's right it'll go right straight back and it's it's there practically now and now we find all those things is because people are trying to find Comfort they're trying to find something that they and remember your comfort is your religion and you make those things your religion see what a Pity in realizing that death lays right before you see until all this has happened until it seems like that there's not a a solid foundation left in the nation to build anything on just let me ask you something you can't believe nothing hardly but the Bible we still have Christ thanks to God you you can't believe anything you get on for instance when you turn your television on you that have such and when you turn your television on and see the the commercials well if a person tried to live by 100th of those commercials you d a week see you couldn't do it and the very thing is some company will break down like a product and say this is the thing here and don't have this one over here and the same company sells the same product then another commercial come on take this on this side and not that in the same company the American people fall for such stuff as that till the whole thing is become a rock until there's no hopes at all [Music] nobody knows what to believe but I'm going to tell you after a while what to believe if you want Comfort if the Lord willing the people they lie cheat steal tell you almost have have to have a bond of security to Bar $5 from somebody it's uh you know the Bible speaks that that there be no love in the last days but just among the elect people that's right the scripture speaks of that that uh husband to be against wife and wife against husband children against parents just among the elected of the Lord will there be any love left the churches has got into the same thing out of social life they brought it into the church their social life and their politics and their other things until they've got the church so confused that it doesn't know what to do they brought politics in the church they brought also social life there social life in the church your social activities uh bingo or Bunko or what they call it and uh these suppers and dances and so forth in the house of the Lord amen why it's it's aity they say well now that isn't that's on the annex remember it was an Annex also that Jesus beat the the merchants out with their merchandise and said it's written my father's house and made a house of prayer and youve made it a d of Thieves it's wrong I don't care where it's that as long as the church the church is not so much the building it's a people in the building and if those people are anticipating in this why it's wrong and they brought that practice now we find out that the churches too are always promising something like television and so forth that they never get to the the thing they promis as I've often said an old quotation man is always praising God for what he did praising God for what he will do looking forward what he will do and then ignore what he's doing they they they fail that's R they become history after a while of the polluted see because they fail to recognize now you can talk of the Comfort Christ give once and say that the Comfort he will give in the ages to come but refuse the comfort that he's got here now far here see it's on the same basis we find that it's become a great thing I find out that there they come that's even becoming Pentecost in the churches it's become into the Pentecostal Realms that they're always a promising something that they never get to it it's always that every fellow has a different sensation and and make it whether scriptural or not their promis and something that they never do get to it until it seems like it's got to a place to where there doesn't seem to be any sincerity the the people don't get down to that real kernel of sincerity it's lost the the very English word of sincerity has lost its its value to the people or about the people's way of of living it's lost its sincerity to them care for he care for you through sunshine or Shadow he still care for God bless you Brothers good evening give you the
