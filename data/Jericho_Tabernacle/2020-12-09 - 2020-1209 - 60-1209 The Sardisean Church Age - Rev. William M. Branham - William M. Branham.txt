then tomorrow afternoon is the service you're a tape service brother uh gene just told me that we begin at two o'clock tomorrow afternoon you people that like to come hear the messages have prayer around the altar you that's seeking the holy spirit or something wonderful time yoda church is nice and warm open ready for anybody at any time that wants to come in and pray and seek the lord the church is open and waiting and we're we'll be expecting him put it like that expecting it tomorrow afternoon anytime that you want to come into the church to pray why it's always ready if they happen to be the doors it's locked or something just across the street there my brother who's the caretaker here i think it's 411 i believe that or 811 811 just about this caterpillar from the church here 811. uh he there his wife would have the key they pull the door together it locks but they leave it open maybe the morning open it up after the service is closed at night to keep children from running through it showing breaking out the windows and so forth you know how kitties are especially in this day so we uh close it on that account the door any time on the church maybe when the other is fixed we'll get it so it'll be different then somebody can be there all the time so that people can come in and pray and seek healing seek the holy spirit you who does not have the holy spirit in your life come down stay or just stay all night if you want to just stay till you do receive it all all over me and god everywhere amen i thought the rapture would come i looked around there and see if everybody was around what was really wonderful i appreciate that we can stand a little of that almost anytime yeah sure hey man i just got in time to get to hear that moment i've missed all the good singing in these meetings because i thought maybe that oh i just so busy you know how it is people people come in by plane by train by you you never know what you see cause it just comes in the phone you have to go to and meet them and pray for them never work just constantly going and trying to study too it makes it quite a problem but we're always happy to meet the people and do what we can for them because it's the that's our we are a public servant for the lord jesus christ to his people in this state we like to do more than we do do but minister rushed in this morning nervous breakdown just going to pieces fine fella and because of he was just overworked got started to get up this little girl stand in the room she started whirling she had a little red pajamas on so the last thing he remembers was a little red dot going around and round and round and round like that went out thing and uh so they rushed him right up so it's um it's just too much work you see the priest says you remember your physical and we we won't we think the whole burdens laid on us but you know god got servants everywhere to take care of some of that so we just do the best we can but a gracious minister trying to do all he can in this last days for his lord is sure and the lord delivered him brought him right back around normally all right and went on this road rejoicing oh a great thing happened today i just don't want to get started on those things you know i told my wife i said no there'll be somebody coming up there and you'll be a man short heavy set dark hair and dark eyes you'll read that sign and start what you're calling i said because the lord's got a message for him i raised up the bible and i said i'm going to lay these things in here so you see that's exactly what the lord wants him to do you live eight years ago a polish man from poland raised in poland at a meeting you come to the platform and they said the holy spirit looked came to him said you're just confused that's what he thought i said it but the holy spirit said the polonium stayed right with him all along and finally drugged him from kansas city to the building last night and then he really got confused when he heard about that water baptism finally holy spirit said rise now and go on up there somebody wanted to come along with him but he refused it causing the vision he come by himself and so and you gentlemen like to read the sign started to turn back away and the wife calling i went the door i said that's that's him let him come on he said what must i do i actually seen he said i i want to show you just so you'll know now see as the lord told me he's coming he asked him i said here's a scripture right here where you go well he's sure to be baptized in the name of jesus christ you may be sitting present now for all i know are you here brother a brother a polish brother he is yeah back over the corner here raise your hand up so that you can see that all right sia you see the holy spirit that just happens all the time many people think divisions just come on the platform oh that don't start it what about it brother leo just everywhere see albert espiritu santo eso de todo el tiempo mucha enterprise viciones solos this is the minor place of it here this is where a little bit happens out there where it's going all day at night that's my wife and she then my neighbor back there brother woods and all those who was around oh my these are the little little things here it's the big things that happen there [Music] has never yet been told oh i'm so happy for it knowing that our lord soon coming and we're going to be with him forever then not forever but for eternity amen for eternity yes willing i believe it's the 18th sunday a week yes sunday a week the 18th i had an awful battle satan's tried to give me this flu that they got going around here i just keep handing it back to him and he hands it to me and i hand it back to him and so i had quite a little battle so we'll probably battle it out next week tremendous and then the lord willing by the next sunday the 18th and uh we are going to try to bring some uh uh service to pray for the sick people cause her the things are backing up and backing up and the real extreme emergencies we're trying to take care of as quick as we can hours all hours of night and everything to come and go to so the 18th we're going to have a regular healing service if you've got some of your loved ones that wants to be prayed for you bring them up bring them in at that time now there uh many of the folks at jeffersonville was telling me said they come up the time they get here about five o'clock so they didn't even room for their cars or six so they i said well you this is our visiting brethren from everywhere people many ministers i said they're they're laying on to the teaching of this person is and we're just trying to hit the highlights and then a little later why we'll have it in book form so he can read it and and it'll be a little a little more added to it because at night you noticed last couple nights of trying to save the voice you see because that big climax that's what i want to see there the revelation of christ be made in this age thing of what it is and now before we start reading the scriptures and i know tomorrow's the big commercial day when we all have to go get our saturday nights groceries in and we have to get them on saturday afternoon or saturday morning one so we can have saturday night free to come to church so we'll try to let out early tonight so he will be too tired tomorrow to get it and get back to the afternoon service with the brothers here with the tapes and and also for tomorrow night now can we just stand a moment for prayer if you will i wonder before we pray if there's anyone here has special requests for prayer if you just let it be known by enough lifted hand god sees now you see whether we're in a needy world or not brother i guess 95 or 98 percent of the audience lifted their hands especially i remember you can't even move without god knowing it he knows your intentions he know what she was asking for let us bow our heads gracious heavenly father we are approaching thy holiness tonight that throne through that promise that you said that you would hear and if we would believe you would give us what we asked for and we are confessing all of our wrongs we realize lord that we're not we're not worthy of any of your blessings we are we are unworthy we are all together unworthy and we do not come as if we were we were worthy and and we've done something great oh father when we look at calvary that takes all the greatness away from us we know nothing else and but christ and him crucified us oh then when we see that he raised up on the third day according to the scriptures for our justification return back forty days later in the form of the holy spirit to abide with us until his visible appearing in the skies at the end time and we see that in time approaching real swiftly now and where the most happy people are because that you have given us this great privilege i'm so thankful father this listening audience sits with bowed hearts and listening crap and then lord i pray that you'll sanctify my lips tonight and every night and every time that i shall come to thy pulpit to speak to thy people because lord never let me speak anything wrong you still have power to close mouths like you did in the lion's den with daniel and if i should ever see anything that wasn't according to your will close up my mouth lord that i speak at night bypass my thoughts put me on the right track part where i'll speak nothing but the truth is where i realize that in that great day these people be waiting out are up on the uh waiting according to the ministry that i preached to them if you come to to take in your stars and your angels your ministers your servants they'll have to be thrashed out first according to these messages that we've been preaching here you'll hold them responsible your servants men now father i pray that you will let the holy spirit speak and not man circumcise our hearts that we can hear him i'll be listening father pray that you'll heal the sick and the afflicted all that the people are in need everywhere let thy grace and mercy be with them have grain every request that was made known tonight by the uplifted hand out across the country while many others are suffering even those who these handkerchiefs represent representing these requests laying under my hand here let the holy spirit answer father and heal the sake of me speak to us now through thy written word by the holy spirit we asked in jesus name amen lopez [Applause] now tonight it's a little warm in the church the great osean church age coming up and tonight we're approaching that other great church age which will be the the fifth church age of calories we've taken the first church aid which is ephesus i might read these over again at the beginning they were all written out and so i would like to read them over for you that like to check up on your papers the first church age was the ephesian church age from 80 55 to 170 paul being the star and is the first church he works without love was god's complaint reward was tree of life is second church age was 170-312 irenaeus being the messenger of the day and the complaint was a person was tribulations and a persecuted church reward crown of life the third church aid was pergamos saint martin being the messenger to that church the church ages from 312 to 606. the complaint was false doctrine satan's lying the foundation of the papal rule the marriage is church and state together the reward was hidden manna and a white stone san martin fuel message and the fourth church age was tatara colombia being the angel of that church age the messenger 1520 and the church age was papal uh seducing the dark ages last night you know the dark ages and uh the reward was power to now tonight we're beginning on the fifth church age which is the church age of sardis let's say rdis sardis and the messenger to this church age is martin luther becomes more familiar to the bible scholar or this teacher the laity rather today hora esta empezamos that church age began in 1520 and ended in 1750 1520 to 1750. and the age of what we call reformation age and the complaint was using their own name and the reward for the little remnant that was left was to walk before him in white raymond and their names in the lamb's book of life may the lord bless us as we undertake now yes uh now we begin on the first verse of the third chapter of this church age the message to sardis the period of the reformation a small believing remnant left just almost out of the mensah some of the newcomers i might say on this share that so much you won't be behind in it it's rather crude and sometimes we're going to come where we can place our messages out on the draw it up come in the afternoon fix it up may do it sunday carlos now these each represent the church age one two three four five six seven this beginning with philadelphia and this up here represents the the pentecostal power or a church that was on pentecost it was quite a large church at the beginning but they started a denominational spirit coming among them trying to denominate the church which was called the deeds of the nicholades can you hear me way back yeah all right let's get no it wasn't a doctrine yet and then we tucked the word and broke it down what was deeds what was nick o'lady and that's a foreign name to us nick oladian la sobras de los nicolaitas so i took the greek and broke it down and nickel means to conquer or to overcome or overthrow something nicole layton lady is the church laity nick only uh a deeds that was trying to overthrow the laity and put all the blessing and the only one to read the bible the only one to give the interpretation would be the bishop or some great head person of the church [Music] a principal de la iglesia then we find out in the second church agent would be in the squeeze way out this is still pentecost and this is denomination d now in the third church eight pergamus pentecost is almost squeezed out but the doctrine of denomination it become from a deedshare all the way to a doctrine here married right here they married the this group here that had overpowered the pentecostal groups now the way i'm saying that brethren that is the honest stack that's according to the sacred writings of the histories the books of the nicene council fox book of the martyrs and all the great ancient writings historia i've got some of the oldest manuscripts there is and everyone i'll say this was not not saying uh pentecost that don't mean when i say pentecost that doesn't mean this organization the day we're living in that's just as guilty as the rest of them but i mean the real pentecostal the real spirit of god with the original doctrine with the original blessings with the original names with everything exactly the way it began at the beginning like it went through the bible now then when we come to this age you see how far pentecost comes up can you see it in the back all right can you make it out way back there all right hold on hold on now here come last night the great age that were in here constantine constantine c-o-n-f he being a pagan was asked these christians here the ones that had the doctrine of the nicolas if they would pray that he would win a certain battle well he would become a christian constantino during that time when he was at battle he dreamed a dream that he should by a white cross that was put before he said buy this you win that's right [Music] then he woke his army up and painted on their shield a white cross and that was the birthplace or the beginning of the catholic order today called the knights of columbus you can't glean one thing from the histories of him being converted he was nothing but a crooked politician hi [Music] he had in his mind the idea to to unite his kingdom and make it strong so he and himself being a pagan worshipped the idols then he seemed that the doctrine of the nickelodeons had almost squeezed out to a place so he used the same a strategy that we found out last night and jesus predicted it 304 years before it come to pass that he would teach the doctrine of balaam how that balaam deceived the children of israel calls them to commit fornications and and offered take things offered to idols eat things now we know that eating these things offered to idols what it really was was worshiping is adoration going in they were bowing down to idols putting idols back in the christian church just like balaam did back there had israel to commit fornications is well constantine did the same thing with his strategy and he made a church he gave a lot at the nazi council and then they he made a a lot of um great buildings that he had and he converted these into churches much and then he made a big marble altar decorated with gold and gems up above there he put like a throne and he made one man the head like a he was called then a bishop and they put him up on this throne uh boniface iii not only did he walk around with clothes on like the peasant did but they made him um a great uh fine robes and dressed him up like a god and set him up there and called him the biker viker or the vik vicarious ophelia adelia means instead of the son of god grandest draw write that out by carius ophelia and then when you draw a line on here and add the numbers and you got exactly what god said the mark of the beast was 666 amen i've been in rome have been in the vatican and the triple crown jurisdiction hell heaven and purgatory see seen the crown seen the vest actually on a thursday afternoon at three o'clock i was supposed to meet the last pope that was there baron von bomberg heather and he said now when you go brother branham the first thing you have juice batter on your right knee and kiss that ring really down bloomberg daniella amen i said i give i have nothing it's a man he they said i said there's one thing i'll give a man his title if he's reverend uh that's all right bishop elder doctor whatever i'm glad to sue the man sonny pence do a worship to a man i'll owe my homereach to one man jesus christ that's the only man i doubt now for us to just forget it just cancel out i wouldn't take it and so after coming home i found out there was another great american did that too teddy roosevelt he refused to do it on account remember that in history that he refused to see the pope because he had to kiss his ring or they have it on a big toe also you know so oh no balaam then we found out last night over now here first before we leave here they consolidated this church and married got some pagan ideas pagan idols that was in the church nasi quentos the god of jupiter the god of the sun the god of mars the god of venus and all those idols of gods and he took all them out of the pagan churches and put up paul peter virgin mary all those and said here is your biker because jesus told peter i gave you the keys and he is an apostolic successor that's still catholic doctor to this day jupiter and what did they do brought idol worship into christianity so-called christianity not real christianity because the little pentecostal yes christianism christianism i remember i don't i didn't say baptist methodist presbyterian they're at all but the real january wine article of god was pentecost was is and will always be that's where the church begins right here with pentecostal power alberta now you say is that right brother brahm i'll ask you to take the histories and look down through the stream of time to hear and find out if every one of those real true children of god didn't hold on to that pentecostal blessing is spoke in tongues interpret tongues had signs and wonders baptized in the name of jesus christ everything that the apostles did they did too right down to that was interpreted i took paul and arenas and um and and down to saint martin columbus every one of those men's plum down into this age here had signs and wonders the mic was having a little uh is that better yes all right no it's shake their head they can't hear at all now bill all right can you is it oh you hear me now now how's that is that better everybody says all right paul that's one mark against you all right [Music] okay muy in this age here then while he made up this great big thing and put up this man here as a universal bishop over all the churches given plenty of money and so forth and promised them and did unite the church and state together and let the church control the state made him a great man so there is exactly what constantine did is the very same thing that we found over in this other church that what god said that um in the days of elijah that they suffered that woman jezebel to subdue his children that taking place in the dark age just black it out and for almost 1 000 years it from about 500 to 1500 right that's 606 to 5 30 at 5 20 is exact numbers but right on 1 000 years there are bloody persecutions read the history a catholic will tell you that the christian church they was a christian church they are the denominational christian church but the true pentecostals was pressed out killed and murdered and put to death by the popes and bishops and so forth bloody as it could be someday that's going to cost me my life see to say that well that's one thing sure i know which way i'm headed [Music] this keeps dripping with blood but it's getting an hour and hours you see according to what's going on in the nation it isn't going to be long ago
