[1:03:13] [Music]
[1:03:23] 6 of the Lord was upon me and carried me
[1:03:26] out in the spirit of the Lord and sent
[1:03:28] me down in the midst of the valley which
[1:03:29] was full of
[1:03:30] [Music]
[1:03:39] Bones and caused me to pass by them
[1:03:42] round about and behold there were very
[1:03:44] many in the open Valley and low they
[1:03:46] were very
[1:03:46] [Music]
[1:03:52] dry and he said unto me son of a man can
[1:03:55] these bones live and I answered oh Lord
[1:03:57] God thou
[1:04:04] knowest and again he said unto me
[1:04:06] prophesy unto these bones and said unto
[1:04:08] them oh you oh ye Dry Bones hear ye the
[1:04:11] word of the
[1:04:12] [Music]
[1:04:18] Lord thus sayith the Lord God unto these
[1:04:21] bones behold I cause breath onto enter
[1:04:23] into you and you shall
[1:04:36] live and I will lay sin news upon you
[1:04:39] and will bring up flesh upon you and
[1:04:40] cover you with skin and put breath in
[1:04:42] you and you shall live and you shall
[1:04:44] know that I am the
[1:04:45] Lord now verse
[1:04:53] 11
[1:04:55] [Music]
[1:05:00] then he said unto me son of man these
[1:05:01] bones are the whole house of Israel
[1:05:03] behold they say our bones are dried and
[1:05:06] our hope is lost we are cut off for our
[1:05:20] parts therefore prophesy and say unto
[1:05:23] them thus sayith the Lord God behold all
[1:05:25] my people I will open your Graves and
[1:05:26] cause you to open up your Graves and
[1:05:29] bring you into the land of
[1:05:36] Israel and you shall know that I am the
[1:05:38] Lord and when I open your Graves all my
[1:05:40] people and brought you up out of your
[1:05:48] [Music]
[1:05:51] Graves and shall put my spirit in you
[1:05:53] and you shall live and I shall place you
[1:05:55] in your own land then you should know
[1:05:56] that I the Lord have spoken it and
[1:05:58] performed it sayeth the
[1:06:01] Lord God bless theing of his word may be
[1:06:05] seated we also thank the
[1:06:16] musicians now in this
[1:06:20] morning I'd like to speak on the dry
[1:06:23] bones
[1:06:27] now if you read these uh verses that we
[1:06:29] just read or the first
[1:06:34] chapters that are before chapter
[1:06:39] 37 you see you find Israel that's in a
[1:06:42] pagan
[1:06:44] State and being in that Pagan
[1:06:50] situation and then God shows Israel
[1:06:53] their condition
[1:06:56] it shows it to the prophet
[1:06:59] Ezekiel and it shows that their
[1:07:03] Condition it's like a valley of dry
[1:07:08] bones and that's because they were out
[1:07:10] of their
[1:07:11] Homeland they're out of the promised
[1:07:16] land and it shows that you cannot have
[1:07:20] life if you're outside the Promised Land
[1:07:26] so then there were dry
[1:07:28] bones and they didn't have
[1:07:32] life so then they thought they had no
[1:07:35] more hope for
[1:07:37] them but yet God
[1:07:40] spoke through the prophet
[1:07:43] Ezekiel and they were
[1:07:45] restored to their
[1:07:48] Homeland and then being restored back to
[1:07:51] their
[1:07:52] Homeland They will receive life
[1:07:56] just like you when you find yourself in
[1:07:58] a
[1:07:59] valley a valley is a low
[1:08:02] Point uh speaking
[1:08:05] geographically and it's surrounded by
[1:08:08] mountains when you find yourself in a
[1:08:14] valley and it's impossible to overcome
[1:08:16] what you're being confronted
[1:08:18] with you lose all hope it doesn't
[1:08:22] matter God can still
[1:08:28] restore so the same thing that happened
[1:08:30] to Israel in the
[1:08:32] natural they find themselves in
[1:08:34] different
[1:08:37] nations and then being in different
[1:08:39] nations they didn't have
[1:08:41] life also the God's
[1:08:45] people were different
[1:08:48] denominations and God had to take them
[1:08:50] out of those
[1:08:52] denominations and take them to their
[1:08:55] Homeland which is God's
[1:08:57] word and being in God's
[1:09:00] word they can have eternal
[1:09:05] life so the restoration of the
[1:09:08] word is what produces
[1:09:12] life brother Ram says in the message
[1:09:14] restoration of the Bright
[1:09:18] Tree prophesy son of man can these bones
[1:09:22] live
[1:09:26] I wish we had time I got to wrote down
[1:09:27] here but I have to miss
[1:09:30] that prophesy can these bones
[1:09:37] live what's the four stages of that
[1:09:39] coming forth of that
[1:09:45] church what's the fourth stage of
[1:09:47] ezekiel's dry bones coming
[1:09:52] forth but the life only come not when
[1:09:55] the sinu skin was on
[1:09:58] them but when the wind blowed upon
[1:10:03] them that's when come back that fourth
[1:10:05] message of
[1:10:08] Life have you gone and you study that
[1:10:12] message of the restoration of the bright
[1:10:16] tree and here we're talking about the
[1:10:18] restoration of the dry
[1:10:22] bones and brother R is talking about how
[1:10:24] that uh that tree of
[1:10:26] life that bride
[1:10:30] tree had four meses of
[1:10:32] death they began to eat off that
[1:10:36] tree so then life brother Ram
[1:10:39] says came back to the life back to the
[1:10:45] roots when we see a tree here in the
[1:10:49] natural especially in this winter
[1:10:52] time we it finds like the tree is
[1:10:57] dead and it seems like there's no way of
[1:10:59] coming back to
[1:11:05] life so
[1:11:08] then so when when uh Springtime
[1:11:12] comes then life comes
[1:11:16] again the same thing happened with this
[1:11:18] tree in the
[1:11:20] spiritual now the four messengers of
[1:11:22] death
[1:11:25] they began to eat off that tree in the
[1:11:27] first the four stages of of the church
[1:11:30] ages but brother Bram
[1:11:33] says just like there were four messagers
[1:11:35] of
[1:11:37] death there were four messagers of life
[1:11:40] that God
[1:11:42] sent to restore that that back that
[1:11:47] tree and brother Ram also compares the
[1:11:49] the restoration of the
[1:11:51] tree of the restoration of the dry
[1:11:56] bones and brother Ram says what are the
[1:11:58] four
[1:11:59] stages of the dry bones of
[1:12:03] Ezekiel if you notice the first stage is
[1:12:07] justification under
[1:12:09] Luther which is the fifth Church age
[1:12:13] which is the
[1:12:15] sinus Wesley the second is
[1:12:18] Wesley
[1:12:21] sanctification and it's the sixth Church
[1:12:22] age
[1:12:24] and that's the flesh the
[1:12:26] third it's the
[1:12:29] Pentecostals it's the uh the the age of
[1:12:34] laa which is the restoration of the
[1:12:37] gifts now many get
[1:12:40] confused they believe the restoration of
[1:12:42] the
[1:12:43] gifts is the is the restoration of
[1:12:46] Ezekiel my brother says that's not
[1:12:49] it and then the
[1:12:52] fourth it is the eighth
[1:12:55] age where life
[1:12:57] comes because number
[1:13:00] eight is the is the number of number of
[1:13:03] Life the number of
[1:13:06] Eternity of eternal
[1:13:08] life if you can show that
[1:13:12] image so when this Cloud
[1:13:16] came introducing it
[1:13:19] spiritually not
[1:13:21] physically not literally an eigh
[1:13:24] age but
[1:13:27] spiritually it takes us to an eternal
[1:13:32] age because the bones had to be
[1:13:35] restored the body had to be
[1:13:39] restored it had to receive life once
[1:13:42] again so when it received
[1:13:45] life it was the the restoration
[1:13:51] completed so when this cloud appear here
[1:13:53] in the United
[1:13:54] States it was
[1:13:57] photographed and it was published in a
[1:14:00] magazine you can show the next
[1:14:04] image it was published in this magazine
[1:14:07] called life
[1:14:11] life now let's take a sharp
[1:14:16] turn now brother compares the dry bones
[1:14:18] of
[1:14:19] Ezekiel Phoenix like the City of Phoenix
[1:14:23] this very same
[1:14:25] city I'm going to read several quotes so
[1:14:27] you can understand
[1:14:30] it and the first uh message the uh the
[1:14:34] believer the position of a believer in
[1:14:37] Christ he says let's pray Heavenly
[1:14:40] Father we we love
[1:14:42] you take us under your
[1:14:47] care God this lovely little church
[1:14:52] here
[1:14:55] oh I see them scattered everywhere like
[1:14:57] a sheep without a
[1:14:59] Shepherd just like Ezekiel Saw that
[1:15:03] Valley of Bones being scattered all over
[1:15:05] the
[1:15:08] valley uh Born Again
[1:15:10] children they love you
[1:15:13] Lord with all their
[1:15:16] heart father somehow get a hold of their
[1:15:22] hearts
[1:15:24] Pho and may there be an oldfashioned
[1:15:25] hungry for God break out across
[1:15:30] Phoenix till there be a Revival that
[1:15:33] sweep from the South
[1:15:36] Mountain to the north
[1:15:39] Mountains from the East to the
[1:15:41] west and this
[1:15:43] Valley the Maricopa
[1:15:49] Valley and this Valley will become
[1:15:50] illuminated with the glory and power of
[1:15:52] God
[1:15:57] as every Church coming together like
[1:15:59] ezekiel's dry
[1:16:02] bones May the sin skin and flesh rise
[1:16:05] upon the
[1:16:08] church as we go in the name of the Lord
[1:16:13] Jesus you can see that
[1:16:17] Ezekiel God showed him a valley full of
[1:16:19] dry
[1:16:21] bones and here in Phoenix live in the
[1:16:23] valley of Maricopa
[1:16:26] okay and the message
[1:16:30] experiences now this in the in the uh
[1:16:32] year
[1:16:35] 47 uh just a little while after he found
[1:16:38] himself with the
[1:16:40] angel and the angel sent them forth to
[1:16:43] go send for bring forth a
[1:16:47] Revival Phoenix has been the hardest
[1:16:50] that I have ever had
[1:16:52] yet
[1:16:55] the smallest crowds that ever attended
[1:16:56] and so forth Phoenix has been
[1:17:02] Phoenix Phoenix it's the city that I
[1:17:04] love above all cities in the world is
[1:17:06] Phoenix I love
[1:17:11] it and that I want to be I want this to
[1:17:13] be my home
[1:17:15] someday and that's why Satan fights me
[1:17:18] so hard
[1:17:19] here that that's
[1:17:22] right
[1:17:25] but with God's grace I'll win and I
[1:17:27] shall have what I've asked for by God's
[1:17:30] grace Phoenix and what I want to see in
[1:17:33] Phoenix and I'm just going to pray that
[1:17:35] God do
[1:17:42] it because I want to see the churches
[1:17:44] all in Phoenix like they was up in the
[1:17:45] nor Northwestern
[1:17:49] territory all in one heart one Accord
[1:17:52] and one place
[1:17:56] in the year
[1:17:57] 62 unbelief does not hinder God the
[1:18:01] prophet
[1:18:04] says and we're so happy to be here
[1:18:08] today in this fine atmosphere of
[1:18:13] worship and I appreciate so much the
[1:18:15] attendance of these
[1:18:17] churches since we've been in this
[1:18:20] city and throughout the Maricopa Valley
[1:18:24] such a wonderful
[1:18:28] Fellowship I said the other day I think
[1:18:30] that the word
[1:18:34] Phoenix something that's come out of
[1:18:38] nothing now that might be the wrong
[1:18:42] expression but I think something on that
[1:18:46] order that this city was
[1:18:48] built a desert
[1:18:51] here just right in the middle of the
[1:18:52] desert
[1:18:54] so it rose up out of the
[1:18:57] chaos and a few years
[1:18:59] ago I came into this
[1:19:02] city some 10 or 15 years
[1:19:07] ago and then the churches was kind of
[1:19:10] battling with each
[1:19:13] other you could hardly get they
[1:19:17] said well if this group is going to do
[1:19:20] the cooperation we're
[1:19:21] out
[1:19:24] pH so I see I find out there's another
[1:19:28] Phoenix has rose
[1:19:33] up such a Brotherhood of Fellowship
[1:19:35] among the
[1:19:37] Brethren all the churches
[1:19:41] together and in the message forsaking
[1:19:44] all speaking about Phoenix once
[1:19:47] again this is a beautiful
[1:19:51] country I I I found this kind of a
[1:19:54] outstanding that he said
[1:19:56] this I don't think there's anything like
[1:19:59] it that I've ever
[1:20:02] seen and I travel pretty near every
[1:20:05] nation in the
[1:20:07] world and never seen nothing in Europe
[1:20:10] Italy
[1:20:14] Asia anywhere in the
[1:20:16] orients Phoenix they ever compared with
[1:20:19] Phoenix
[1:20:21] Arizona
[1:20:23] that's right it's the most beautiful
[1:20:24] place I've ever
[1:20:29] saw but oh it will look like an alley up
[1:20:32] in the side of what what would be in
[1:20:34] that great
[1:20:35] Millennium I don't know why brother
[1:20:37] brandham says
[1:20:38] phix that's Phoenix the most beautiful
[1:20:41] city and if we live
[1:20:44] here and it it's so hot 11 months out of
[1:20:47] the year but that's what he
[1:20:50] says the message the angel of God
[1:20:55] father I thank thee for
[1:20:58] this another privilege for this
[1:21:07] evening for the third trip to this
[1:21:09] lovely little city of Phoenix or the
[1:21:10] Valley of the
[1:21:15] Sun where my heart has yearned to be
[1:21:17] since a little
[1:21:20] boy oh God somehow I pray
[1:21:28] God that you'll start us a Revival in
[1:21:30] every Church there in the
[1:21:32] city Grant it
[1:21:36] Lord May a great moving Revival come to
[1:21:39] this
[1:21:41] city and the message the second
[1:21:47] coming we thank thee for the opportunity
[1:21:50] that we have for meeting here in this
[1:21:51] great City
[1:21:53] sitting here in the desert Phoenix by
[1:21:56] the name of
[1:21:58] Phoenix something that's raised up out
[1:22:00] of
[1:22:03] chaos and we pray father right in this
[1:22:05] great
[1:22:10] city that you raised up out of the chaos
[1:22:12] of generation of a
[1:22:18] generation a marvelous Church of the
[1:22:20] Living
[1:22:21] God fill with the spirit
[1:22:26] anointed Great Men of God may come from
[1:22:29] this
[1:22:31] city proclaiming the message around the
[1:22:35] world and the Harvest
[1:22:39] time I said what a time
[1:22:43] now that's been about 12 14 years
[1:22:47] ago Phoenix now it's in the city called
[1:22:49] Phoenix
[1:22:51] Phoenix
[1:22:53] Phoenix is something that's built built
[1:22:54] from the
[1:22:59] ruins I said well that same thing
[1:23:01] happened to you this
[1:23:03] morning God built you
[1:23:05] up I believe this
[1:23:09] morning from a ruined
[1:23:11] Health to a good
[1:23:15] health and then Mage the
[1:23:20] Paradox then my first meeting
[1:23:24] M I'm gonna preach here is in Phoenix
[1:23:26] Arizona is at Phoenix Arizona
[1:23:30] Phenix Phoenix is something that can
[1:23:32] raise out of
[1:23:34] nothing that's what God does he takes
[1:23:38] nothing raises something out of
[1:23:43] it we read all these quotes so you can
[1:23:47] see what brother Bram
[1:23:49] says Phoenix of the City of Phoenix
[1:23:53] Phoenix and what Phoenix uh
[1:23:57] means there's an image that I want to
[1:24:02] show this is an image that I found from
[1:24:04] a young
[1:24:06] man I believe from
[1:24:08] Mexico years
[1:24:10] back and I got my attention I want you
[1:24:13] to see
[1:24:16] it now once again in the Quast that we
[1:24:18] just
[1:24:21] read how many you know that Phoenix is a
[1:24:23] bird
[1:24:28] okay Phoenix means something that has
[1:24:30] come out of nothing
[1:24:33] pH Phoenix is also something that's
[1:24:35] raised up out of
[1:24:38] chaos Phoenix is something that's built
[1:24:40] up from the
[1:24:43] ruins and so when God takes
[1:24:47] Ezekiel and he sees the Valley of the
[1:24:49] dry
[1:24:51] bones they're in that condition like the
[1:24:54] Phoenix in chaos
[1:24:57] ruins and they come to be
[1:25:01] nothing but nevertheless God speaks to
[1:25:04] the
[1:25:04] prophet and asks him the
[1:25:07] question and one might
[1:25:10] think this is the prophet
[1:25:15] Ezekiel this man already had fellowship
[1:25:18] with
[1:25:20] God and he might know that for God
[1:25:22] there's nothing
[1:25:24] impossible but when God speaks to
[1:25:28] Ezekiel he's ask him can these bones
[1:25:30] live
[1:25:32] again and one might
[1:25:35] think that his response might
[1:25:38] be sure God you can do all
[1:25:40] things but Ezekiel
[1:25:44] said seeing the scene that was before
[1:25:49] him only Lord you know
[1:25:55] and that's how many of us
[1:25:57] are in that
[1:26:00] condition we've already had fellowship
[1:26:03] with
[1:26:05] God we've already seen in the past what
[1:26:07] he has
[1:26:10] done now we're in a valley in our
[1:26:12] spiritual
[1:26:14] life and we don't know if we can come
[1:26:16] out of
[1:26:21] it
[1:26:24] Phoenix I also got in the uh the website
[1:26:27] there in
[1:26:29] Phoenix of why they chose this
[1:26:32] name Phoenix now this is from the web
[1:26:35] page from
[1:26:36] Phoenix history of the city of the bird
[1:26:39] history of the city
[1:26:42] bird the City of Phoenix was given its
[1:26:48] name by its Founders because it sprung
[1:26:51] up from the ruin of from its former
[1:26:55] civilization that had vanished into
[1:27:02] history as a result the phoenix bird
[1:27:04] became the official City
[1:27:06] symbol the
[1:27:11] myth the phoenix bird symbolizes
[1:27:14] immortality the
[1:27:16] resurrection
[1:27:18] life after
[1:27:21] death
[1:27:24] and in ancient Greek and and Egyptian
[1:27:28] mythology it is associated with the sun
[1:27:33] god according to the Greeks the bird
[1:27:35] lives in
[1:27:37] Arabia near a cool
[1:27:40] well every morning at
[1:27:45] dawn the son God will stop his Chariot
[1:27:48] to listen to the bird sing a beautiful
[1:27:51] song while it bathed in the
[1:27:55] well only one Phoenix exist at a
[1:28:00] time so when the bird felt its death was
[1:28:05] near every 500 to4 1,461
[1:28:11] years it would build a nest of aromatic
[1:28:15] wood and set it on
[1:28:18] fire then the bird was consumed by the
[1:28:21] flames
[1:28:24] a new Phoenix sprang from the from the
[1:28:28] p and inolved the ashes of his
[1:28:35] predecessor in an egg of myr and flew
[1:28:37] with the hopos in the city of the
[1:28:42] sun where the egg was deposited in the
[1:28:45] altar of the sun
[1:28:50] god in Egypt it was us usually depicted
[1:28:52] as a
[1:28:56] heron but in classic literature as a
[1:28:58] peacock or an
[1:29:00] eagle but now why did I read
[1:29:04] that it speaks about this
[1:29:06] bird this
[1:29:10] associated with a Greek and Egyptian
[1:29:14] mythology now we don't believe in those
[1:29:16] things we believe in the Bible we
[1:29:19] believe in the
[1:29:20] message
[1:29:24] but that there is a truth that exists
[1:29:28] Pho about the
[1:29:31] Phoenix but throughout
[1:29:33] time they have taken
[1:29:37] that and they plac their own
[1:29:41] interpretations to bring forth their own
[1:29:45] religions phix but just because the
[1:29:50] Phoenix because it in the uh the culture
[1:29:53] of the
[1:29:55] Greek doesn't mean it has nothing to do
[1:29:57] with
[1:29:58] us and a good example about
[1:30:01] this it's in Acts
[1:30:05] 17 here's
[1:30:09] Paul now he goes to a specific place in
[1:30:14] Greece acts
[1:30:20] 175
[1:30:29] and they that conducted Paul brought him
[1:30:31] onto Athens and receiving a commandment
[1:30:33] onto Silas and tootus for to come to him
[1:30:36] with all speed they
[1:30:44] departed now while Paul waited for them
[1:30:46] at Athens his Spirit was stirred in him
[1:30:48] when he saw the city wholly given to
[1:30:51] idolatry
[1:30:58] therefore disputed he in the synagogue
[1:31:00] with the Jews and with the devote
[1:31:01] persons and in the market daily with
[1:31:03] them that met with
[1:31:19] him and the certain philosopher of the
[1:31:22] epicureans and of the stoics and
[1:31:24] conjured him and said some said what
[1:31:26] will this babbler say others some he
[1:31:28] seeth to be said set her forth of
[1:31:30] strange Gods because he preached onto
[1:31:32] them Jesus and the
[1:31:40] resurrection and they took him and
[1:31:42] brought him onto erag saying may we know
[1:31:45] what this new doctrine whereof thou
[1:31:47] speakest
[1:31:50] is
[1:31:53] for th bring us certain strange things
[1:31:55] to our ears we would know therefore what
[1:31:57] these things
[1:32:07] mean for all the for all the atheen for
[1:32:10] the strangers which were there spent
[1:32:12] their time and nothing else but either
[1:32:13] to tell or to hear some new
[1:32:20] thing
[1:32:23] then Paul stood in the midst of Mars
[1:32:25] Hill and said ye men of Athens I
[1:32:27] perceive that in all things you're too
[1:32:31] superstitious now in English it says the
[1:32:33] word
[1:32:36] superstitious now Superstition is
[1:32:38] meaning something
[1:32:50] crazy
[1:32:56] for as I passed by and behold your
[1:32:57] devotions I found an altar with this
[1:32:59] inscription to the unknown God whom
[1:33:01] therefore you ignorantly worship him I
[1:33:04] declare unto
[1:33:06] you you can see that
[1:33:09] Paul he's he's with the Greek
[1:33:12] people and these
[1:33:15] people they have an altar of a God that
[1:33:18] they don't know and they worship Him
[1:33:24] so they can see that they have a part of
[1:33:25] the
[1:33:26] truth but not all the
[1:33:29] truth pH the same thing is applied to
[1:33:32] the to
[1:33:35] Phoenix it's part of Greek
[1:33:39] mythology but it also has something to
[1:33:41] do with
[1:33:43] us so how can we
[1:33:47] separate of what is Greek
[1:33:50] mythology and what belongs to
[1:33:52] us and that is by the
[1:33:55] Revelation that's in the Bible and in
[1:33:58] the
[1:34:01] message because the
[1:34:04] Phoenix let me tell you it's in the
[1:34:07] Bible it's in the
[1:34:13] Bible the message he cares do you
[1:34:19] care says we're at the end and we see
[1:34:21] see we're at the
[1:34:24] end there's no way to build upon that
[1:34:32] corruption how can we build a city Upon
[1:34:34] A charred ruins of a Sodom and
[1:34:38] Gomorrah remember that Sodom and gomor
[1:34:41] was also found in a
[1:34:44] valley and a place geographically where
[1:34:46] they were
[1:34:48] at it reflected their spiritual state
[1:34:53] they were they were uh beneath or or
[1:34:55] drowned in
[1:34:57] sin it says how can we do
[1:35:00] this there's only one Phoenix
[1:35:04] left and that's the coming of the Lord
[1:35:11] Jesus Oh My a purification through the
[1:35:13] tribulation
[1:35:16] period to bring back a restoring of a
[1:35:20] world
[1:35:22] for a people who are just in the sight
[1:35:24] of
[1:35:25] God and live by his
[1:35:29] word now we want to see Phoenix in the
[1:35:31] Bible
[1:35:32] right now this is in Malachi
[1:35:36] 4:1 I just finished saying that
[1:35:40] Phoenix it is the coming of the
[1:35:43] Lord now in verse
[1:35:50] one
[1:36:01] for behold the day cometh that shall
[1:36:03] burn as an oven and all the proud and
[1:36:05] and all that do wickedly shall be
[1:36:07] stubble and the day that cometh shall
[1:36:09] burn them up sayeth the Lord of hosts
[1:36:11] that it shall leave them neither nor
[1:36:12] root nor
[1:36:14] Branch pH now here's the
[1:36:19] Phoenix go ahead but unto you that that
[1:36:21] fearth my
[1:36:24] name shall the son of righteousness
[1:36:27] arise and with his
[1:36:31] wings will bring
[1:36:35] healing and you shall go forth and grow
[1:36:37] up as calves of the
[1:36:41] stall now this bird was a bird
[1:36:43] associated with the
[1:36:44] sun now our our
[1:36:47] Phoenix is the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:36:50] Christ
[1:36:52] and he is our son of
[1:36:54] righteousness but he also has
[1:36:57] wings like in both languages it
[1:37:02] says and and on one languages it says
[1:37:05] healing in his
[1:37:07] wings and the other language it says he
[1:37:09] brings salvation in his
[1:37:13] wings and when that bird comes to
[1:37:16] die it turns into ashes it becomes
[1:37:20] nothing
[1:37:21] verse
[1:37:28] three and you should tread down the
[1:37:30] wicked for they shall be ashes Under The
[1:37:32] Souls of your feet in the day that I
[1:37:34] shall do this sayeth the Lord of
[1:37:37] hosts now you can see
[1:37:40] Phoenix it is in the
[1:37:43] Bible but not in the way that the world
[1:37:46] brings
[1:37:47] it now in Greek
[1:37:49] mythology because that's a pagan
[1:37:52] belief but just because it's a pagan
[1:37:57] belief doesn't mean there's no truth in
[1:38:02] it better yet brother Bram
[1:38:06] teaches that that Catholic
[1:38:08] Doctrine when they
[1:38:11] baptize in the name of the father Son
[1:38:13] and Holy
[1:38:15] Ghost that that is a pagan
[1:38:20] teaching
[1:38:22] but in that teaching there is a
[1:38:24] truth because Jesus himself
[1:38:28] said go and go bring
[1:38:33] disciples baptizing them in the father
[1:38:35] Son and the Holy
[1:38:37] Ghost but the Catholic church does not
[1:38:39] have the
[1:38:42] Revelation that's the name of the father
[1:38:44] Son and the Holy
[1:38:45] Ghost it's the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:38:49] Christ just because they have have a
[1:38:51] pagan teaching I'm going to throw it
[1:38:54] away there's truth in
[1:38:56] it but it's by the
[1:38:59] Revelation that you know what is the
[1:39:02] truth and what's not the
[1:39:05] truth the same thing with
[1:39:11] Phoenix now once again
[1:39:15] Ezekiel he sees the valy of the dry
[1:39:20] bones and God interprets to him what
[1:39:23] this
[1:39:24] means in Ezekiel
[1:39:32] 3711 then he said unto me son of man
[1:39:34] these bones are the whole house of
[1:39:38] Israel behold they say our bones are
[1:39:42] dried and this is the the portion where
[1:39:44] I want you to focus
[1:39:47] on and our hope is
[1:39:50] lost
[1:39:53] now them humanly
[1:39:55] speaking they didn't have no they no
[1:39:57] longer had
[1:39:59] hope to be
[1:40:04] restored and that's how the Church of
[1:40:06] the Living
[1:40:07] God just like
[1:40:09] paganism entered the
[1:40:13] church with a teachings of erroneous
[1:40:18] things that took away the life to the
[1:40:21] from the
[1:40:22] tree in this case the
[1:40:26] bones and it seemed like there was no
[1:40:28] longer
[1:40:29] hope for God's
[1:40:32] word to produce eternal life in their
[1:40:37] children but what's impossible for
[1:40:40] man for God is not
[1:40:44] impossible so they say they
[1:40:48] thought they believe their Hope was lost
[1:40:52] but yet again they were
[1:40:55] restored but that is a
[1:40:58] faith and Romans
[1:41:12] 4:17 as it is written I have made thee a
[1:41:14] father of many nations before him who he
[1:41:16] had believed even God who quickened the
[1:41:18] dead and call those things which is not
[1:41:20] as though they
[1:41:23] were Verse 18
[1:41:27] notice who against hope believed in
[1:41:31] hope that he might become the father of
[1:41:33] many
[1:41:36] nations according to that which was
[1:41:38] spoken so shall thy seed
[1:41:42] be so Abraham received the
[1:41:46] promise that he received the
[1:41:48] promise in his old age
[1:41:54] when humanly it was impossible for him
[1:41:55] to have kids but God told him you're
[1:41:59] going to receive a
[1:42:02] child and you should be father of many
[1:42:04] nations and father of
[1:42:08] Faith but in the time where God calls
[1:42:12] Abraham humanly it was it was
[1:42:15] impossible there was no longer
[1:42:18] hope for him to have a son
[1:42:23] but did that stop God of course it
[1:42:27] didn't but when hope is
[1:42:31] lost that's when you're begin to use
[1:42:34] this Faith verse
[1:42:38] 19 and I'm
[1:42:41] sorry and not and being not weak in his
[1:42:44] faith he considered not his own body now
[1:42:48] dead being not being this body now dead
[1:42:54] now notice how Abraham's body
[1:42:58] was he was now
[1:43:02] dead and and Ezekiel Saw the valley of
[1:43:05] dry
[1:43:06] bones The Human
[1:43:09] Condition The Human
[1:43:12] Condition it tells you there's no more
[1:43:15] hope but the faith of Abraham it tells
[1:43:19] you it tells you can be done it is
[1:43:24] possible but
[1:43:27] hope it only has a certain
[1:43:29] limit but the faith of
[1:43:32] Abraham doesn't see the human
[1:43:35] hope doesn't see The Human Condition
[1:43:38] they see God's
[1:43:40] promise shall these bones live again of
[1:43:44] course they
[1:43:45] can can I have a son of course you
[1:43:49] can
[1:43:52] when all hope is
[1:43:54] lost one should use the
[1:43:57] faith and believe on what to believe to
[1:44:00] believe what you
[1:44:01] believe is more
[1:44:04] real it's more
[1:44:07] true and believe your situation in that
[1:44:09] moment is a
[1:44:19] lie
[1:44:21] the brother says in the message God's
[1:44:23] covenant with Abraham and his
[1:44:26] seed Abraham believed
[1:44:29] God he never thought of
[1:44:32] reasonings he never he never thought of
[1:44:35] the
[1:44:37] matter without now the Mind
[1:44:40] reasons but Faith believes it
[1:44:42] anyhow Faith don't
[1:44:47] look the Bible said against hope he
[1:44:49] believed in Hope
[1:44:52] when there was not even a
[1:44:55] hope he still believed
[1:44:59] anyhow and it was imputed to him for
[1:45:03] righteousness and if you don't have that
[1:45:05] kind of
[1:45:07] Faith you're not Abraham's
[1:45:14] seed now the message Christ is the
[1:45:16] mystery of God
[1:45:19] revealed oh how I wish I had time to go
[1:45:21] back into
[1:45:23] Ezekiel and pull out them dry
[1:45:27] bones show you and he said Can these
[1:45:29] bones live again he said
[1:45:34] prophesy how can prophecy
[1:45:37] come only through the
[1:45:40] prophet it's the word of the
[1:45:45] Lord hear ye Dry Bones the word of the
[1:45:49] Lord
[1:45:51] and Senus came and skin Came Upon
[1:45:55] them and they stood up a mighty
[1:45:58] Army now notice
[1:46:01] this they started in a
[1:46:03] valley in the Valley of the dry
[1:46:09] bones and they began to March toward
[1:46:12] Zion where is Zion it's up in the
[1:46:16] mountain from their their bottom
[1:46:19] condition
[1:46:21] you should be restored to the most
[1:46:23] highest
[1:46:31] point now brother when he speaks about
[1:46:37] Ezekiel said Ezekiel
[1:46:41] prophesied he say only prophecy comes to
[1:46:43] the
[1:46:46] prophet and he says in the message the
[1:46:48] anointed ones at the end time
[1:46:53] no no more there's no more higher order
[1:46:55] to reveal the
[1:46:57] word notice there's no more higher
[1:47:02] order now God's word throughout the
[1:47:05] ages it's in a valley of dry
[1:47:08] bones but Ezekiel
[1:47:13] prophesied and turned into an army that
[1:47:15] was marching to
[1:47:17] Zion now here the Prophet Elijah
[1:47:21] it shows us here throughout the
[1:47:24] ages that the age was was in the same
[1:47:28] condition but we have reached the fourth
[1:47:32] stage where life comes
[1:47:36] in there's no more higher order to
[1:47:39] reveal the
[1:47:40] word than
[1:47:43] prophets but the only way the prophet
[1:47:45] can be
[1:47:47] Vindicated is by the
[1:47:49] word
[1:47:51] remember now here's the faith of
[1:47:53] Abraham the third
[1:47:56] pool was opening them Seven
[1:47:59] Seals to reveal the hidden
[1:48:02] truth that's been sealed in the
[1:48:07] word I want you to know what brother
[1:48:09] Bram
[1:48:11] says that throughout the
[1:48:13] Revelation that we're in the fourth
[1:48:16] stage of the dry bones of
[1:48:19] Ezekiel that's when life comes
[1:48:22] in and when Phoenix comes
[1:48:24] in he brings salvation and healing in
[1:48:29] his
[1:48:31] wings he said it was the third
[1:48:34] pool that opened the Seven
[1:48:38] Seals but he
[1:48:47] also when I said that a humble little
[1:48:49] woman
[1:48:52] the first time this ever
[1:48:53] happened the third
[1:48:56] pool upon a human
[1:48:59] being was a little humble
[1:49:04] woman so the same
[1:49:06] Faith the same
[1:49:09] power to open up the
[1:49:12] seals that was in his highest
[1:49:16] point that it shows us we're in the
[1:49:18] highest point in God's word
[1:49:21] it was the same
[1:49:23] power with the same power that was used
[1:49:25] on sister hat
[1:49:28] Wright pH and it's the faith of a
[1:49:32] phoenix because Phoenix means that
[1:49:34] you're in a
[1:49:37] valley you could be in ruins in
[1:49:41] chaos your life turned to be
[1:49:43] nothing Satan has won you
[1:49:47] over there's no way you can come out of
[1:49:49] this
[1:49:52] pH that is what Phoenix
[1:49:55] represents that even though you find
[1:49:56] yourself in that low
[1:49:58] situation without any hope without
[1:50:02] exit humanly
[1:50:06] speaking then God restores you out of
[1:50:08] that
[1:50:09] condition he takes you out of there he
[1:50:12] brings you
[1:50:16] out phix so that faith of Phoenix
[1:50:20] it's in the
[1:50:22] Bible now let's let's demonstrate
[1:50:25] it in Matthew
[1:50:30] 15:22 like I said we we
[1:50:34] know and I believe we studed some of the
[1:50:37] message the third
[1:50:39] po it's creative power it's a spoken
[1:50:43] word it's the revelation of the seals
[1:50:46] it's
[1:50:49] life
[1:50:52] now in Matthew
[1:51:04] 15 verse 22 behold the woman out of
[1:51:06] Canaan of Canaan came out on the same
[1:51:08] coast and cried out him saying have
[1:51:09] mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my
[1:51:12] daughter is grievously vexed with the
[1:51:16] devil you see the Revelation sometimes
[1:51:18] between the lines
[1:51:20] verse
[1:51:23] 23 but he answered her not a
[1:51:30] word and his disciples came and beside
[1:51:32] him saying send her away for she cry
[1:51:34] crith after
[1:51:41] us but he answered and said I am not
[1:51:43] sent I not have sent but unto the lost
[1:51:45] sheep of the House of
[1:51:48] Israel the first quot that we wear from
[1:51:50] Brother
[1:51:52] Bram Phoenix when he Compares Ezekiel to
[1:51:56] Phoenix Pho the children of God that's
[1:51:59] in
[1:52:01] Phoenix it's dispersed throughout this
[1:52:03] whole
[1:52:05] city it's talk about the lost
[1:52:09] sheep of the House of
[1:52:11] [Music]
[1:52:12] Israel and when God shows
[1:52:15] Ezekiel in the condition of the
[1:52:18] valley
[1:52:21] this is the condition of the House of
[1:52:24] Israel verse
[1:52:31] 25 then she came and worshiped him
[1:52:33] saying Lord help
[1:52:38] me but he answered and said it is not
[1:52:41] meat to take the children's bread and
[1:52:43] cast it into the
[1:52:47] dog and she said truth Lord yet the dogs
[1:52:50] eat of the crumbs which fall from the
[1:52:51] master's
[1:52:58] table then Jesus answered said unto her
[1:53:00] oh woman great is thy
[1:53:03] faith be unto thee as thou
[1:53:08] Wilt and her daughter was made whole
[1:53:10] from that very
[1:53:13] hour Phoenix now we're talking about the
[1:53:15] faith of
[1:53:17] Phoenix in M no in
[1:53:22] Matthew it speaks that she came out of
[1:53:25] Canaan now we know that the four
[1:53:28] Gospels it talks about the same
[1:53:31] story but but different points of
[1:53:36] views now Matthew says she came out of
[1:53:40] Canaan but in
[1:53:41] Mark
[1:53:48] 7:25
[1:53:51] say for a certain woman whose young
[1:53:53] daughter had an unclean Spirit heard of
[1:53:54] him and came and fell at his
[1:53:56] feet Pho now remember
[1:54:00] Phoenix was part of Greek
[1:54:04] mythology we see that there is a truth
[1:54:06] found in
[1:54:07] there verse
[1:54:10] 26 the woman was a
[1:54:13] Greek and a Ser ofation by
[1:54:18] Nation you see the word phoenix in
[1:54:22] there Phoenix the the name of Phoenix
[1:54:25] here in this
[1:54:28] city was taken from out of that region
[1:54:31] there of of of of
[1:54:36] Phoenician so this woman who was a c
[1:54:40] phenician used the faith of the
[1:54:43] Phoenix faith of God of the spoken
[1:54:46] word and she was a pagan
[1:54:54] and she besought him that he will cast
[1:54:56] forth the devil out of her
[1:55:04] daughter Jesus said unto her let Let The
[1:55:07] Children First be filled for it's not
[1:55:08] meat to take the children's bread and
[1:55:09] cast it onto the
[1:55:13] dogs and she answered them yes yet the
[1:55:17] dogs under the table
[1:55:20] eat of the crumbs of the children
[1:55:26] crumbs and he said H for this saying go
[1:55:28] thy way the devil has gone out of thy
[1:55:31] daughter so the faith of
[1:55:34] Phoenix was used by a certain
[1:55:38] phenician was the power of the spoken
[1:55:42] word now woman was a
[1:55:45] pagan it speaks of how
[1:55:47] God in the dry bones
[1:55:51] that the Israel was in
[1:55:54] paganism God's Al God's people's
[1:55:57] also the bride throughout the
[1:56:01] ages were in in Pagan
[1:56:05] teachings but God was going to restore
[1:56:08] them God was going to take them out of
[1:56:11] paganism and it was a
[1:56:13] pagan that used this
[1:56:16] power to restore the the condition of
[1:56:24] daughter cenia C
[1:56:33] phenician it means a native or
[1:56:35] inhabitant of Phoenicia when it was a
[1:56:37] part of the Roman province of
[1:56:41] Syria in the message the uh the availing
[1:56:43] of God brother Ram
[1:56:46] says says look at that cenan woman who
[1:56:49] run to
[1:56:52] him and said thou son of David have
[1:56:54] mercy on
[1:56:56] me he never as much rais his
[1:57:00] head she had no claims on him as a son
[1:57:03] of
[1:57:03] David she was a
[1:57:08] gentile no more than my daughter has
[1:57:10] claims on me as a
[1:57:13] husband or my wife as a
[1:57:17] daughter yet she is my daughter and my
[1:57:19] wife
[1:57:21] wife she's my daughter in the
[1:57:25] gospel but Earthly she has no rights to
[1:57:27] call me a
[1:57:31] father but notice this Gentile woman had
[1:57:33] no claims on
[1:57:35] him as son of
[1:57:37] David But Blind
[1:57:40] barus but did see he was a
[1:57:44] Jew now he comes as son of
[1:57:48] man
[1:57:51] you have to know these words and these
[1:57:54] things look at had right that
[1:57:57] time when the third
[1:57:59] pool you remember
[1:58:01] it of all of
[1:58:05] everything that woman said the right
[1:58:08] thing you got to say that right
[1:58:12] word the right thing to
[1:58:17] God so you can see
[1:58:21] so the human condition of har R it's in
[1:58:25] a
[1:58:30] valley says speak to this
[1:58:34] mountain there said her crippled
[1:58:36] sister her aged
[1:58:39] father she was
[1:58:41] poor she could ask for
[1:58:45] money and financially she would find
[1:58:47] herself in a valley
[1:58:51] but financially she was barely able to
[1:58:53] make
[1:58:57] it and she gave part of her
[1:59:00] money to the renov the renovation of the
[1:59:03] brandham
[1:59:07] Tabernacle and brother Ram wanted to
[1:59:09] return that money back to sister
[1:59:13] hadie but it was in that moment that God
[1:59:15] revealed to brother
[1:59:18] Bram I remember her remember him in that
[1:59:20] passage in the
[1:59:22] Bible there was a widow
[1:59:25] woman that went to the house of
[1:59:28] God and gave the little of what she
[1:59:32] had forgive me she gave much of what she
[1:59:36] had that much for her might be little
[1:59:38] for
[1:59:40] us it was a little money for us but that
[1:59:43] was the much that she
[1:59:45] had what you
[1:59:48] s it might seem
[1:59:50] small you're you're going to
[1:59:53] reap what you
[1:59:55] sow and the faith of the third
[1:59:58] pole is the rap the rapturing
[2:00:02] faith it's the latter
[2:00:06] rain and the latter rain is the is the
[2:00:09] Harvest the pick the reaping
[2:00:12] time now she sold in
[2:00:17] God to give God what everything that she
[2:00:20] had even though she was in her low
[2:00:26] condition and she reaped or picked up
[2:00:28] the Harvest there in the third
[2:00:30] pool and being found in a
[2:00:33] valley she was now in the
[2:00:36] mountain to receive the
[2:00:39] salvation of her two
[2:00:47] children she could have asked for
[2:00:49] anything she wanted
[2:00:54] to I said ask anything that's in your
[2:00:57] heart anything you want to you ask it
[2:01:01] and thus sayith the
[2:01:04] Lord I'll speak it behind you and you
[2:01:06] have
[2:01:08] it she said the salvation of my two
[2:01:11] boys says you have it in the name of the
[2:01:16] Lord notice that the condition of these
[2:01:18] two
[2:01:20] Bo they were in a
[2:01:22] valley there was no human
[2:01:25] hope for them to be
[2:01:29] saved and those two little modern
[2:01:32] teenage snickle frits
[2:01:36] boys that they hated the very cause of
[2:01:40] Christ they grabbed one
[2:01:44] another and began to scream the
[2:01:46] blessings of
[2:01:48] God
[2:01:49] the power of God struck that
[2:01:52] place Banks fell in his
[2:01:55] plate I don't know what happened about
[2:01:57] 10
[2:02:00] minutes now remember how does prophecy
[2:02:02] come
[2:02:04] forth how does the restoration come
[2:02:08] forth by the prophet
[2:02:12] Ezekiel now here for me is a prophecy
[2:02:15] that the prophet is bringing
[2:02:17] forth friends you realize what that
[2:02:22] was I had never felt in my life such an
[2:02:26] anointing the first time it was ever
[2:02:28] performed in a human
[2:02:30] being it bypassed the
[2:02:34] aristocrats bypassed everything
[2:02:39] else and it went to a little poor little
[2:02:41] old widow woman living up in the hill
[2:02:45] there and God know what she was to ask
[2:02:51] her boys were G gloriously
[2:02:55] saved the very minute it was
[2:02:59] spoken if she would have asked for
[2:03:02] $10,000 it had been given onto
[2:03:06] her if she would ask for the sister's
[2:03:10] healing it'd be given to
[2:03:13] her I I believe the
[2:03:15] Church of the Living
[2:03:17] God now
[2:03:23] is moving into a sphere now that's going
[2:03:25] to shake the whole
[2:03:30] world that's the first time it's been
[2:03:32] since the days of Jesus of Nazareth to a
[2:03:34] human
[2:03:34] being ask anything that you will and it
[2:03:38] should be given unto
[2:03:39] you anything you
[2:03:45] desire don't you see the words of Jesus
[2:03:47] Christ being fulfilled
[2:03:50] oh it's going to come come to pass
[2:03:52] pretty
[2:03:54] soon I'm looking for it to happen in
[2:03:56] this
[2:03:57] meeting I'm want to happen it
[2:04:01] now that that anointing will strike the
[2:04:03] whole
[2:04:08] church and she will rise to her feet
[2:04:10] like a mighty Army
[2:04:15] marching she wants that he wants that
[2:04:17] anointing to come to the church
[2:04:22] and to turn into a mighty Army of
[2:04:25] God in Ezekiel
[2:04:27] 37 and still in the Valley of the
[2:04:30] bones God tells Ezekiel verse
[2:04:35] 9 he he me prophesy unto the spirit onto
[2:04:38] the
[2:04:39] wind prophesy son of
[2:04:43] man and say to the wind thus sayith the
[2:04:46] Lord
[2:04:47] God come from the Four
[2:04:53] Winds oh breath and breathe upon these
[2:04:55] slain and they may
[2:04:59] live so I prophesied as he commanded
[2:05:02] me and breath came into them and they
[2:05:07] lived and they stood upon their feet now
[2:05:10] know what it says
[2:05:13] here an exceeding great
[2:05:17] Army
[2:05:20] the faith of the third pool Phoenix is
[2:05:23] the faith of
[2:05:26] Phoenix they can restore any
[2:05:29] condition it's the faith that God
[2:05:33] used for the
[2:05:35] world when it was there empty and
[2:05:38] without
[2:05:40] order it was the same faith that he
[2:05:42] used for the dry
[2:05:45] bones to restore his own word
[2:05:49] that they lost life throughout the
[2:05:53] ages and it's the same
[2:05:55] faith that God
[2:05:57] used and gave brother
[2:06:00] brandham to speak to the
[2:06:04] squirrels and gave salvation to the two
[2:06:07] boys nothing's impossible for
[2:06:10] God there's no more
[2:06:13] hope there is no more
[2:06:15] hope but that doesn't matter
[2:06:20] God doesn't want to see your Human
[2:06:23] Condition he doesn't want to see your
[2:06:25] condition that's around
[2:06:26] you God only wants you to believe in
[2:06:29] him and he's going to take care of the
[2:06:33] [Applause]
[2:06:34] rest now we're in that
[2:06:38] age when that Faith was
[2:06:42] used now the key
[2:06:45] is now don't put your faith
[2:06:49] in the
[2:06:51] Earthly in your Human
[2:06:53] Condition and what's happening at the
[2:06:56] moment there's no exit there's no
[2:06:59] solution for you there
[2:07:01] isn't but for God there
[2:07:09] is notice how was that
[2:07:14] faith that God
[2:07:17] used to restore the dry bones of
[2:07:21] Ezekiel to restore that
[2:07:24] body R says in the fifth the fifth
[2:07:29] seal I believe I'm not going to speak it
[2:07:32] speak it in his
[2:07:35] name but I'm going to speak it in my in
[2:07:37] the revelation of my
[2:07:40] faith what happened in Sabino Canyon the
[2:07:42] other
[2:07:47] day
[2:07:49] I believe that the hour is approaching
[2:07:51] when the missing limbs will be
[2:07:54] restored and the glorious power of the
[2:07:59] Creator if God used that
[2:08:02] Faith to restore the body of
[2:08:06] Israel God he can he can also use that
[2:08:10] Faith to restore his
[2:08:13] body the body that you
[2:08:16] have it doesn't matter the situ
[2:08:20] sitation if you're the Seed of
[2:08:24] Abraham you don't have to fear the third
[2:08:28] pool you're supposed to believe or
[2:08:30] depend on that third
[2:08:33] pole and part of that third
[2:08:36] pole is the revelation of God's
[2:08:39] word if God revealed
[2:08:43] it that you're not sick that you don't
[2:08:47] have cancer
[2:08:49] you don't have the spirit upon
[2:08:51] you then believe
[2:08:53] it it doesn't matter what your body
[2:08:55] tells
[2:08:57] you it doesn't matter what the devil the
[2:08:59] devil tells
[2:09:01] you even though there's no more human
[2:09:04] hope but you speak what God revealed to
[2:09:08] you and keep going on like a like an
[2:09:11] army marching onto
[2:09:17] Zion
[2:09:18] now the third
[2:09:21] pool now it is the the Supreme
[2:09:24] omnipotence of
[2:09:26] God it's the greatest power he
[2:09:34] has you may you may
[2:09:39] understand
[2:09:42] says and the the patmas
[2:09:45] vision says man is omnipotent
[2:09:50] so you don't believe that but he
[2:09:57] is a man fully surrendered to God is
[2:10:05] omnipotent did he not say in Mark
[2:10:10] 11:22 whatsoever the things you say
[2:10:12] don't doubt in your heart it'll come to
[2:10:16] pass you can have what you
[2:10:19] said now the thing about
[2:10:22] us and when we tell the mount to
[2:10:26] move we think that the whole mountain is
[2:10:28] going to move but brother R
[2:10:31] says when you tell the mountain to
[2:10:34] move it says a small
[2:10:37] grain a small rock begins to fall from
[2:10:39] the
[2:10:41] mountain and if you study the
[2:10:44] earthquakes it requires from one rock
[2:10:48] to be
[2:10:49] thrown to start an
[2:10:52] earthquake you want the mount to move
[2:10:55] believe
[2:10:57] God doesn't matter what you
[2:11:00] see speak to that that unclean
[2:11:05] spirit and it seems like that Spirit
[2:11:06] doesn't leave
[2:11:08] you God will
[2:11:10] begin begin to
[2:11:12] weaken the power of that
[2:11:16] Spirit through the power the third
[2:11:23] pool what happens when two omnipotents
[2:11:27] meet when God and man comes
[2:11:29] together two
[2:11:32] omnipotents something's got to
[2:11:36] shake whatever you say with that
[2:11:38] creative
[2:11:40] power of omnipotence of
[2:11:43] God knowing that he got knowing that he
[2:11:45] promised
[2:11:46] it he said in his word
[2:11:50] it creates a
[2:11:51] power that goes out
[2:11:54] yonder and bring things to
[2:11:56] pass now see that's the faith of
[2:11:59] Abraham things that is
[2:12:02] not it makes them as they they
[2:12:06] were because two omnipotents have
[2:12:10] met let us let us bow our
[2:12:15] heads now
[2:12:17] remember
[2:12:20] God's going to take you to that
[2:12:22] Valley God's going to take you to that
[2:12:25] condition you will no longer have a way
[2:12:28] out you won't have no more of a
[2:12:32] solution so you
[2:12:34] yourself can
[2:12:38] discover the omip omnipotence that's in
[2:12:42] you it's the seed of
[2:12:45] Faith that's in your heart
[2:12:49] it seems like nothing's going
[2:12:51] on you keep believing
[2:12:55] God we're in that
[2:12:57] age everything shows that we're
[2:13:01] there begin to believe
[2:13:04] it with the omnipotence that's in your
[2:13:07] heart and God
[2:13:12] omnipotent and you'll see the unip that
[2:13:14] you
[2:13:15] have he's reflecting it
[2:13:20] brother says the words that har wght
[2:13:23] said were the words that God gave her to
[2:13:27] say so Heavenly
[2:13:31] Father help us in this
[2:13:35] morning possibly human humanly
[2:13:39] speaking we don't understand why we're
[2:13:41] in these
[2:13:42] conditions we don't want to be in these
[2:13:46] conditions we believe there's many
[2:13:50] in the lives of the people
[2:13:52] here that have struggled this for
[2:13:54] years and they don't find a way out they
[2:13:57] don't find the
[2:13:59] solution but the solution is already in
[2:14:03] them we just it just needs
[2:14:06] desperation to surrender to
[2:14:10] God to use the
[2:14:12] omnipotence to reflect the Life of
[2:14:15] Christ Christ is savior
[2:14:20] and Christ spoke about har right about
[2:14:23] salvation we speak of this
[2:14:26] Lord that your people come to a
[2:14:30] maturity that they don't fear the third
[2:14:33] pole but but they embrace
