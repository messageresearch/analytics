[47:13] and I'm not poor KPM element in the
[47:15] kisser LSP to santoku vias firstly it
[47:19] has to be the Holy Spirit the Lord is my
[47:20] shepherd come formula viendo according
[47:23] to the Bible what I understand that God
[47:24] is the head or L is also a speedy trial
[47:28] or the spiritual husband the gada mujer
[47:31] of every woman other monarchist are in
[47:33] this tabernacle o of every sister that
[47:35] is in this tavern or in any tabernacle
[47:39] men worldwide and bastard that I'm ahead
[47:42] the woman's pastor is Swissport so is
[47:46] her husband sues for her husband
[47:49] yes superstore is her hull is the power
[47:53] Tsukasa now where you are at home get ok
[47:56] what did I want you to turn I'm
[47:59] addressing the sisters seem an absolute
[48:01] sportsman and look at your husband she
[48:03] was poor so your heart according to the
[48:05] Bible for men men suck according to the
[48:07] message he is your pasture OS falando
[48:12] I know naturally and your husband is
[48:15] speaking in the natural connection but
[48:19] first there has to be a connection with
[48:21] Jehovah
[48:22] well I'll insert something here this
[48:24] element of brother brother Branham says
[48:26] Elias Elijah era and pastor was the
[48:29] pastor the head of Jezebel but the
[48:33] Branham says that but she was not a
[48:35] believer and Don says so whose dmms
[48:39] possibly 12-day yeah you're gonna tell
[48:41] me that he was her spiritual husband
[48:44] Savva conectado con la palabra if she
[48:46] wasn't connected with the word tsukumo
[48:49] iva said super story so how is he then
[48:51] going to be her pastor pastor for a
[48:54] person to be the pastor tenemos que
[48:56] estar event then we all have to be
[48:59] within the circle on the past or past or
[49:02] yonder where the pastor is pastoring and
[49:05] then the sheep were there but I don't
[49:07] know but there's an ordinance this man
[49:12] that called a score so that says in
[49:14] mandates everything DSS to palaver and
[49:16] that is his word la palabra we have to
[49:19] be in the world and of course kaya
[49:21] correctamente coma demeanor says so
[49:23] everything can fall perfectly in its
[49:25] place where it must be a bell
[49:29] so Jezebel yeah she denied him as well
[49:34] as her past a era pero es era su pastor
[49:38] but Elijah was her pastor pero la vaca
[49:41] sada Yakunin but was she married with
[49:43] him no señor no well I'll give you
[49:48] another example for the hemp blow for
[49:49] example your soil a store let's take
[49:51] lessons I'm the pastor of this church
[49:52] whatever Michael Jericho Tabernacle Oh
