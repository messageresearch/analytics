um i don't i don't have anything tonight but i i do want to share my testimony i know that the ones that uh know about me i know that this church has been praying for me for the past few months all right i just would like to say thank you for your prayers and it was something in my life that i never in a million years would have thought it would happen to me it was something that it was just just far that i never thought it would happen to me so um to start off i just want to say uh some of the things that was happened to me before i found out and this was the end of last year beginning of this year i just couldn't finish my food and it i i just i i would eat this the portion of the size portion that i would eat is that i would order a happy meal happy meal and i would get full from that and that's and usually i would eat five times more than that and i because of that i lost a lot of weight probably 30 to 40 plus pounds and the other thing that i started to notice is that i would get it um i would get itchy a lot esca especially here in my legs um i just um would i would just constantly scratch the itch and it wouldn't the itch wouldn't stop and i would scratch it so much it was so itchy to the point where her tanta comes and i would just you know in the middle of night we'll just use it to just scratch the itch and all these things would happen to me and i thought that it was i i would just use common sense i would you know take hot showers it will make my skin dry and then put lotion is and then i will notice that i would have this this cough it wouldn't it would happen it will come back it will come and go era and every time i would cough um i would either throw up or vomit or i would just spit out phlegm and i probably stepped on the floor with no socks like my mom told me not to kisa and maybe just that i have phlegm it is and i would never either feel pain never feel pain i would have never uh thought what would have would come happened and um [Music] it was february 7th in the at night time very late um it was around around 11 30. i decided to take a shower and i put all the way to the hot water and i was and i was in there for a while more i usually don't take long showers but i did take a good 30 minutes in there it's because you know the the the pre the water pressure on my head and it was hot and i was in there for a while and i started to feel a bit what i could explain is very sleepy but i wanted to stay there for a bit and then i started seeing i started to see blurry and very blurred and i didn't know what was going on and i just i um just i got um i i just started i just saw i just saw blur i couldn't really feel myself and then i just saw black but before i blacked out i did i do remember c mean standing up going like this and um if this was around 12 something in the morning and my mom was was up in my mother established and she walked past the bathroom and all she heard was the thud on the tub and that didn't sound like a shampoo bottle that sounded way heavier so she went isaac and isaac isaac and then i just i didn't i didn't that woke me up a bit yes and you know when you wake up you don't know where you are so i just i just woke up in the so open up and i was just there just just staring i didn't know what was going on and i find and i always i always lock the bathroom when i take a shower so then she kept knocking and knocking and i said hold up let me just get a towel [Music] and right there that kind of alarmed her a bit yes and i don't like going to the doctor's brothers so i said nah nah i'm fine yeah don't worry about it and she said no i'm taking him to the hospital you look very pale so i said fine and there [Music] and he took me to the hospital and i went to the emergency room at least i entered through there almost and i we checked in and there was a lot of people there is and then there's this lady that told my mom yeah she's been waiting there since 5 p.m cinco and the lady started you know asking me questions you know you know just the the basic doctor questions while she was checking my heart pressure mintes me a and you know checking if i'm breathing right and she said um [Music] what'd you do to make you faint yeah if you can see and she said well uh usually if you take too long your blood pressure goes down this is very common that people would feign in while taking a hot shower i i never knew that i you know i always i during the winter time i always take hot showers but i did see that your heart's a bit anemic it's a little too fast and um before i went to the hospital hospital i would notice that my my watch would tell me medicine that my heart beat would be too too fast and normal and it says oh i've you've been inactive for 10 minutes please get up and do something so i just yeah you know i didn't think much of it as well so then and they put and then they um they they scheduled me to for an mri scan program there's no infections or anything like that no espresso around four in the morning and then they scanned me and they put me back in my room where my mom was me and my dad was was waiting in the parking lot in the car because we just thought it would just be a quick thing you know they can say oh you have some infection in your lungs here's some steroids and you could go home and you know i think that's that i was that's all i thought yeah yeah that was going to happen okay you know i was i was ready to go to work the next day and everything and then here comes the doctor and with a group of nurse nurses so then here comes the doctor and her squad what's going on that's what i thought i didn't tell her and then she she came to me with a very worrying face uh everybody had a face mask but i could see it in her eyes that she was very worried so then um she told she told me and don't say yeah oh we we we checked your your mri scan and um we we have some bad news we found a a big mass in contra that is between your lung and heart it's very very big it's grande and we you have tiny tiny masses around your chest and you have liquid under your heart that is pressure in your heart that would you know would pressure it so that's why my heart kept beating so fast and then she and then she says the next words that i'll never forget and it might be cancerous no one wants to hear that c word and right there as as a like you know that feeling it's very hard to explain but you know that feeling like oh my mom's going to kill me i felt that feeling i don't know no my mom if you know me mama this is going to be a very long journey right away i kind of snapped out of it [Music] [Music] her hand and said it's okay mom everything's going to be okay you know the the doctors could say what they want to say the doctors could find whatever they find and then you know you know um she would still cry so um they finally put me they put me upstairs if and um usually there's different types of of this mass they they diagnosed me with um hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosis hodgkin's that's what's called asisima and usually there's different types of it different so they put me in an icu so they can um perform biopsy to find out what kind of hodgkins do i have classes because in the um the scan you know they found the big mass and they would also find little ones around my chest under my collarbone and under my armpit so then they started performing performing um they put me in a surgery room operation room um to where they could perform the biopsy and then they you know the the the surgeons you know they they just you know they they kind of overheard my mom say isaac so then they would you know you know tell the other nurses oh he likes to say he likes to go but isaac is on the side of the of the bed they were going to put perform the biopsy they were listening to their music and you know i don't even know what they're hearing lady gaga whatever whatever it was but uh the lady that was on the computer on spotify uh spotify you know the dj music you know ask me oh what type of music do you like and and and i don't like to bother people just keep that's fine you do you like drake they go to drake you know you know there's a new album drake you know album the drake i said no i don't really listen to drake no drink no you could just keep it that's fine no no it's fine just tell us what you like and i said well um i'm a christian christian so my so i really i really love gospel music oh oh okay um sure we'll put some of that and you know they looked up scotland do you like today's hits and i said sure it is i mean you know i don't want to tell them what type of music i listen to so they put on you know the the modern christian caleb type music la musica moderna the caleb the christiana where they rap but it's rap for god i knew that god was there with me in that surgery yeah and then i said god you know um i started thinking about that song is so then they put some oh because they can't put um [Music] the medicine that makes you fall asleep [Music] they couldn't put that on me nope because it was a risk for my heart so they did it while i was awake so they put some numbing medicine on me no just just do it just don't tell me just do it just get it over with yeah you know they were putting the needle try to find out which type of you know the c word i had and then they they put on my right arm yeah it's like a like two ivs and you know so they could you know take the blood out easily put medicine into me easier you know do studies on the little piece that they took out parastudio and i i will you know during the hospital um the thing is that you know every time i would get up in the middle of night [Music] you know let's say i move something um you know she's the best mom ever you know and um during that time waiting uh durante tiempo my mom would show me um would show me church services the petition of part of it and you know i would hear that the church read my petition and um and there was you know this went just viral everywhere you know on different pages and different you know pray for this young man brother fabian palma from chile it was also he also posted a thing on facebook too algo and facebook and it um you know the thing that broke me was el paso tabernacle el paso or send me a letter electronic letter una carte electronica you know where it like it's like it like it opens up you know on the screen like a letter and every member from that church put a little message for me and they also put some quotes from brother branham that means they would put scriptures for me um and right there that just that that that broke me yes and that and i i just you know started you know tears started falling down down my face where i just realized where you know how many people how much they love me truly i never felt so much love you know i always i've always been loved but so much it was it was something beautiful and from there you know little things started making me cry oh and i would hear the oh this church also was it's also praying for you and then i and um a week or a week and a half passed by media and they still you know wouldn't they wouldn't say what it was and the doctor came with your squad and she you know came up to me um you know to it's very similar to others yes because before they took out pieces of the the ones i had around my chest you know or we could just get some of the small ones you have here and she's you know she got a little confused she was still feeling me and then she would try to find what was you know the little little um tumors tomorrow [Music] i already know that the prayers were working yes it's probably the steroids that i gave you you know it probably shrunk um and um during those days uh a nurse came up to me i just came here because i fainted in the shower [Music] the universe wanted you to be so then they went uh they put me in um for the second biopsy it was and this time i did feel the needle but after they put it in this was so then they finally took a bunch of chunks out of the big one just to give you an idea how big it was it was like they said 13 centimeters like all around here and so then they start studying the little pieces that they took out if they find anything anyways so then um yeah they diagnosed me with classical hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosis classical and the the doctor doctor um came to me you know said all this and she said that um that they're gonna start planning my my chemotherapies now the chemotherapy chemotherapy it's the the thing that makes you lose your hair huh well not always not it to everybody you know she tried to make a little sad thing but i said i'm like oh ok and then um the i told my mom about it because i i told her just to go home entonces because she wasn't sleeping i told my dad that she wasn't sleeping so they started taking turns where my mom would stay with me all day and on the uh and and then she would leave yellow and and this was during the day where my mom was here can you leave the room please just to talk to him real privately [Music] and it also affects um just just to uh say it like this if you want to have kids one day so the plan is to um you know bank it bank it store it for later so that if you want to have kids [Music] and then she says she's just looking at me and then i was looking at her so she's like so do you want to think about the decision and i said no no no i don't want to do it she's like well you know what if you want to have kids later on you never know if you need it i said no i'm good you cannot used to be in it's okay and she's like oh okay nico oh yeah she looked at her squad his squad was also confused so then they they also brought my mom back in entonces and i don't know why they made her leave me and then i said oh man i wonder what my mom's going to think about this um [Music] because my mom wants to be a nana one day so i don't know if she will say hey you know i want to be a nana one day you should do it so then they explained to my mom and she said oh okay well that's the decision [Music] you can't make up his mind that was a little surprise so then the doctor left entonces kind you know didn't you know say why aren't you doing it or anything like that she just you know wanted to know why uh why the decision well you know i'ma look um i don't want to do it because you know i'm a bit squeamish you know it's like i don't know i don't want no thank you and you know if god is going to give me kids

the promised son hello um if not well then that's not god's will so then they finally planned out my chemotherapy treatments and she started explaining me all the treatments that those start giving me you know and you know as human as a human reaction you know that that did kind of spook me a little yeah i like all right then you know if um if god wants me to go through this well then i gotta go through it you know i didn't want to go through it i wanted for them to you know scam me one more time and then you know oh nothing's there and then it's going to be a whole miracle but god had different plans just like the three hebrew hebrew men all the way to the hottest that they got but there was a fourth person in there so i said you know if i'm going to go through this the more i would identify myself with the characters in the bible identification and i and this made me um have you know i feel like god made me go through this let's say let's you know to in other words i wasn't backsliding but i was very relaxed they gave me a um a little a prayed pamphlet a little prayed a handkerchief and um you know so i always had it in my pocket we'll see you know just to you know have it with me you know put it right there you know i didn't claim i didn't claim it in the name of jesus jesus and one day [Music] i should be um not as desperate as i should be living this

something they they cut a piece of brother brandon's suit it's a parade you know it's uh it's a cloth from brother branham suit yes or a tie it was it was a piece of his clothing [Music] cut up my flesh to give the cortana so i i um you know i i had it there was a paper clip that came with it so so i would always keep it in my shirt it was something very special to me especially so then finally came the first round of chemo primer and they plan uh five months or five rounds of chemo and um uh while they were they put it through my picc line in my that's where they start giving me the medicine administration so i didn't feel anything at that time while they were given to me in this moment but it was the next day where they had to give me again and i never felt so horrible in my life [Music] and it was just a horrible place to be there first and um it happened the first round happened three days for three days and i um [Music] i was just just felt horrible that was my lowest

they finally released me finally um february 26th and before they released me antes gave me another dose of chemo media that was a week separate from the first time they gave me here and when i was at home you know it felt so good to be in my back in my bed you know thanking everybody that i i'm i'm back home that was discharged and it was on a saturday and the doctor did warn me to always stay home especially your defense will go to the sickness instead of your body that's fighting but um i didn't really do it to as disobedience but i i but i did go to church the next day and right there my dad put me on the spot to also give my testimony and i gave my testimony to the church [Music] and when i was explaining um how i went through my chemo interests it was like i was remembering what was happening again and um i felt velvet i felt kind of sick while i was up there like and like kind of like feeling how i felt and um i don't know what happened but um uh i'm more very certain that i also fainted up there uh i did my dad did catch me on time though and they they sat me down and also a brother went up to help me as well and my dad prayed for me for me and i kind of woke up during the prayer especially i was like what happened and then i stood up again and my dad said you could stop i'm like no that's fine i'll continue so there i went um [Music] after my testimony this position testimonial i just told my mom uh [Music] because of my last the last dose of my chemo cause of the ultimate chemotherapy it would cause jaw pain in the mandible and it would cause pain in my stomach and this happened the symptoms kind of was there for around a week and thank god that you know finally um it stopped the symptoms and this time instead of going to the hospital hospital you know i would go to a clinic to do it and there and there i i was doing that for um [Music] for three months and a half now has you know there was times where i just you know couldn't go to church but if i felt good then then i would go to church let's see then i i didn't want to miss out and then finally before my second round i noticed there was a lot of hair on my pillow case um i will see here on my cover shampoo in my hand and i say well it's happening so before my second round is and you know and i knew it was falling so i just did it i went to get it over with anyways and there i was you know and honestly it happened for a very short amount of time i did my five rounds i would feel better and better each time you know it was kind of like this and um [Music] and i wouldn't i wouldn't feel bad as i did the first time come on where i just um i think i would i think um it was uh i kept thinking about uh how you know i would get nauseous and everything and i feel like that would that made me even um where i would take the medicine entonces that i would feel horrible because i was already getting ready to feel horrible so the last part that was my fault but during those times um it was around the third round before the third round they were gonna have a special speaker even antenna [Music] and i said well well i can try it you know i'm not really good in my spanish but i could try and he said okay but that wednesday i was going to take my chemotherapy [Music] it was all god told as if i knew god was with me the whole time because i knew it was god from the start he never he never made my parents go in debt from the hospital or because of the chemo or cause dela chemotherapy it was all covered for from my from my insurance so i knew it was god from there and finally um after the last chemo round especially the chemotherapy they scanned me miss canelo and they and then when i finally visited the doctor to know the results of we do um we're thinking about you taking radiation i don't i don't want to take that and you know um the doctor continued you know i was talking to my team and half of my team would say yes you do need it and half of my team would say no you don't need it because your mass is that size now usually if people will have that you know they don't need it but but because it was so big in the beginning we we recommend for you to do it but this time it's optional so it's optional if you want to take it or not yes i'll go optional and you know she started listing all the side effects for that [Music] you know the radiation can also cause another cancer cancer skin cancer cancer you know i i said you know i was thinking to myself and the doctor the doctor said you know you know we'll let you think about it and if you don't want to take it then it's something of your choice to do to and and then um the doctor left and is was thinking about it and i said um no it's already dead i never accept it in the beginning and i will never have it and finally the nurse came finally and she said well muerto and then they brought all the nurses and they started to you know sing a song you know a song about you don't need chemo anymore it's
