presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit amen you may be seated Brethren this morning if the sisters could help me with the first slide this morning I've got just a small thought that I'd like to speak about this morning I'd like to title it what is a Revival for and then the answer came to me taking out the trash J and in talking with brother Johnny Jun roughly a year ago and he told me one of his favorite messages that his father preached and he titled it taking out the trash and in my mind I said I'm going to steal that so this morning we want to take out the trash amen brothers so when you're at home and you're cleaning the house you've got a trash can and that trash can is getting more and more and more full and it gets to such a point where the trash is overflowing over the trash can and we're so lazy my wife tells me take the trash out a little bit I'll go hold on hold on do it now because it's overflowing all right all right W and then I tie up and I throw it out to the dump because now it starts to stink now it's the same in the spiritual we've got to take out the trash amen amen Brothers like I've told you before I believe you're getting to know me there there's words that are so simple I've got to take the definition of these words so the second slide I've got the definition of that word trash things that are no longer useful or wanted and that have been thrown away and for synonymous words waste nonsense good for nothing scum amen Brothers It's a a waste it's nonsense good for nothing scum I don't know if I'm pronouncing that word in Spanish the right way esia escoria scum in Spanish things that are no longer useful nor wanted am amen Brothers I want to control myself because I feel like I'm want to jump the first time that I searched the word trash in the message the first time the prophet speaks about trash have you ever been interested in that word trash even the prophet he speaks about trash and the first time he speaks about trash is when his mother in-law Hope's mother she said don't you dare take my daughter with that trash those Pentecostals don't you dare to take my daughter with that trash and for the world we're just trash when the prophet once the flood came and then he was there in his boat and he tried to crank the motor and it didn't want to crank he said Lord if you get me out of here I will never think that those people are trash we should never think that the people are trash the prophet said I noticed the cream of the crop in English it says the phrase the cream of the crop the cream of the crop the the the the the good ones the good they're the elite the best let's read what the prophet says I thought what does the sea jump like that for well there comes a mighty rushing wind and that causes a Revival well brothers so what what is A Mighty Wind as you're walking there there's many uh those Mighty winds that come that uh scatter dust and then sometimes you're just walking and A Mighty Wind comes it it's it's good it feels good it almost knocks you over right it stumbles you almost knocks you down a mighty rushing wind now I want you to follow me because I'm getting somewhere it says the same amount of water that's right but it's got a Revival what does it do it it throw floats all the trash up on the shore we need a scoring out once in a while oh amen amen once in a while we need a cleaning or a scoring out to take out all that trash from the trash from my natural home my spiritual home my mind my spirit my soul the trash starts to accumulate so that's why God sends a Revival to cleanse us once in a while God gives us a Revival and a sweeping Mighty Wind that rushes down down through the church like that like that and floats all the trash out of us out of us God purifies Us by the Holy Spirit like our brother Eli told us on Friday the holy spirit that began and the Holy Spirit that will finish the work it doesn't matter what level you're on it's the Holy Ghost God purifies Us by the Holy Ghost the wind that comes from Heaven that shakes your soul not your body but it's your soul the the body will be dying but your soul when you can have a differences with your brother but your soul you still love him what we need is not bodily healing it's the soul healing if you can't see your brother and greet him with the genuine smile then something's wrong with my experience I want to be bride I want to be like Jesus Christ brother Billy Paul says I never could see the differences between my father's enemies and my father's friends because my father he acts the same with [Music] everybody he doesn't make differences of nobody I'd like to be like him Prophet says he sweeps you sweeping you with the uh like with the broom you're still the same creature but you got scored out when we're here in the service and then the Holy Spirit comes down you think about receiving from God and then you receive you start to cry you raise your hands and how does the prophet say how do we know when we're Born Again by your fruits by your life you take the word out and your life will demonstrate you've been born again Prophet that this revival comes it scorns you out and it it takes out the trash but we're the same creature now don't forget about that quote we're getting to something I don't want to be the same creature I want to be a new creature in Christ Jesus I don't want to just be cleansed I want to be a new creature amen Brothers I believe that that should be our prayer in English he uses the word scorn out what the prophet just said that he clean in in English it means to be polished to be cleansed this revival comes and starts to polish you but yet you're still the same person the same creature I was a I was a hog he takes a hog you I clean it I I I I shine it and give it a Revival so that I can shine it up I put a little bow on it but then by its nature it goes back to the mud by its nature I can't blame it I can't crucify it it's it's a hog but once it's an eagle he's in the heavens flying the prophet says El presy and you idolize these Idols of these Elvis presence and so forth and you permit that stuff to enter into your house throw that trash out of your house we're Christians buzzers eat on the dead carcass and we're not buzzards we're doves now I was presy now that's you know the old school I I rock and roll now there's different rock and roll I rap there's rap He said get that out of your house get the rap out of the house get that trash that worldly music get rid of [Music] itye but Kanye's got a Christian album out and Elvis pres he also sang Christian song The Prophet say I never I've encountered such a demon-possessed person elv presy like Elvis Presley and he he also sang Amazing Grace the prophet says get that stuff out of your house we need to clean our house the music we listen to that causes an effect in our lives what do we see what do we listen to we've got to clean our house the prophet says we're Christians we're doves Prophet says says move out some people want to apply the blood and stay in you apply the blood and kick out all of the trash out of the house and have a house cleaning time you women take off them short you men throw out them cigarettes and women too get out all the old stuff out of this system here that's called the world if you love the world or the things of the world is because the love of God is not even in you and when you're ready to apply the token and then empty up get ready for it to receive the Holy Ghost we've got to cleanse ourselves get those things out they're not of God you've got to empty out and get ready to receive the Holy Ghost Prophet says when a little Eagle drops the mother she went right down picked him up and brought him right back and if you're an eagle you'll do the same way by a fallen child of God even if he's wrong how many can say Amen up to that point if the the brother is mistaken even the mother Eagle will go to him and if we're Eagles we'll do the same thing for a fallen Son of God if he got out of cater and got out of the scripture and got Topsy turby go to him that's what the thing you need to do then God all men will know you're my disciples when you've got love one for another when will the World know that we're Jesus's disciples when we've got love for one and for the other what's a disciple one that follows Jesus Christ now the whole world says and prophesies to be Christians rock and roll even the rock and roll artists they say that they're Christians and then they all with their makeup but I said that's tremendous because even the Devils believe and prophesy that Jesus Christ is King but how will the people know we're true Disciples of Jesus Christ that's when you and I love one another when you and I love each other with a genuine love we can talk about the Rapture the resurrection of the dead of the Prophet the third pole the the tent I can speak about all of that bring quotes but then if you and I don't love one another if you will never we'll never see him amen Brothers The Prophet's going to come back and the third pole I say Amen but if we can't love one another never will we get to the rapture do we love one another Brothers do we love one another and the world is so thirsty for that amen they're thirsting for love notice what the prophet says the world so thirsty for that for a friend you have a friend and that friend is Jesus Christ and it's Jesus Christ made flesh that flesh is me I am your friend of every one of you it's Jesus Christ in me made flesh it's Jesus Christ in him made flesh it's your friend your friend that's tremendous right Jesus Christ is my friend but he's a spirit and he needs flesh that flesh it's you it's me the world it's thirsty for a friend that friend it's Jesus Christ through his bride and God is love and until we can until we can get Brotherly Love we'll never get very far with God God is love until we can get that brotherly love will never get very part with God we need a Revival of Love amongst the children of God we need a Revival of Love amongst the children of God it doesn't matter what happens it doesn't matter what's going on the devil wants to he wants to destroy but when there's love the devil can't get in and with with the pyramids of Egypt they're so fine and together those stones are so stuck together a razor blade can't even get in between that's how every one of us should be a pyramid but very stuck together can penetrate and get among in between us that when the spirit comes that wants to go against my brother my sister it can't get in there's a Revival of love in between the children of God Prophet says you see a road is built a good road is built the highest part is in the center it allows all the traps wash off both sides that's it when a man really comes to Christ he's got his eyes centered on the church he's got his eyes centered on the go he's got his eyes centered on everything else what does it say Brothers I think I need glasses here what does it say he's got his eyes centered centered on Christ not on the church not on the pastor not on the associate pastor no other person only to Jesus Christ amen Brothers we're on a road the prophet says and the road is made at the highest point so that the track can fall on both sides and the trash goes down to my left and to the right but man he's got his eyes fixed on Jesus Christ on the Destiny on the Rapture what's going to come it says if he's a little bit emotional he'll be a fanatic goes a little bit to the right he's a fanatic if he's a little bit cold he'll be on this other side and he'll be just a cucumber and his intellectual but the main thing is right in the middle of the road with enough spirit in you to keep you warm and moving oh Brothers there's a very important key right there to be warm and always be moving or in action to always be doing something for Jesus Christ always something help with something be in action because if you don't get into action you're going to get cold you don't want to do anything and then the evil spirit comes in when you start to get cold but when you're nice and warm and you're in action doing something for Christ then the devil can't move you amen the prophet says amen and knowing enough to keep yourself then it is necessary for you to know the message know your Bible you should know enough to keep yourself because spirits will come to get you out of the word but you know enough word to keep yourself and when you've got no doubt you don't know where to go you got a question that's why we've got a pastor to go to him I don't know the answer to this says to move just as the spirit moves not till not after just as the spirit moves you love the Lord Brothers Prophet says and there'll never be any benefit until every person that profess to be a Christian will forget his own ability and yield himself to God then God can achieve his purpose when you and I we surrender our ability what we know we surrender to God until I can say I can't do anything I'm nothing that's why problems come in our lives problems to Humble us sometimes we think I'm at the highest point of the mountain but then when a problem comes then I notice I'm nothing the prophet says that happens to to shake us up then the prophet says then God will fulfill his purpose sending not a Revival but then brother you just said that we need a Revival to take out the trash that's inside of us now the prophet is telling us it's not a Revival Prophet says brother what he needs to do first it send a killing the prophet says that's right so we can revive you have to die before you can be born born again he needs a killing of ourselves remember the first quote when a Revival comes it it polishes it cleans us but we're the same creature the same person that Revival is just polishing but first we need is a killing we need to die we need to die to our own thoughts our own ideas what we want our desires the the prophet says it's not a Revival first it's a killing because a Revival what does a Revival mean it means to revive what we've already to bring back unto life so to bring us back unto life we've got to die we've got to be dead of this flesh the prophet saids you have to die in order to be born again this Tabernacle needs a killing the prophet didn't say brandom he said this this Tabernacle I say this Tabernacle it needs a killing including myself me that's what the prophet says this Tabernacle from top to bottom it needs a killing to die to die to ourselves includ myself we all need a killing to be revived in a new life A New Hope A New Hope a new experience we need first a day of mourning the first quote we have to clean ourselves polish ourselves but this quote we need to die that's why we're the same person that's why we can't over our character ourselves the prophet says our worst enemy it's not the brother nor is it the devil it's myself and when you achieve to die and then you lift your hands and the Revival comes that Mighty rushing wind comes you get up not as the same creature but as a new creature in Christ Jesus but you first of all you need a killing the prophet says this Tabernacle it needs a killing including myself the prophet says I know that I'm reading many quotes it says how much do you really mean it Prophet says don't play now this is not a playing time this is a receiving time this is a time that you must get it come dump it out right now dump out what the trash trash that's inside of us the prophet says will you it's just a question the opportunity is here to receive not to play around it's to receive the prophet he asks a question will you come give all you've got to God say God I ain't got very much I'm just a little housewife I can't do very much Lord but I can read your Bible I can pray every day all right now let's start over say God I don't gotten plenty I'm just a little housewife even the housewives they've got the power I can't do very much Lord but I can read your Bible I can pray every day I can throw out all the trash that's in my mind may God help us brother because the Rapture it's around the corner I don't want to stay behind I don't want anyone to stay behind I know that you want me to stay I know that you know that I don't want you to stay but we've got a purpose to get ready to go with Jesus Christ let's get out all the trashs to one side I can read your B I can read the Bible I can pray every day I can throw out the trash where's the trash at in my mind in my mind the prophet says that the mind is the gate to the spirit that's why the spirit there's sicknesses in the spirit when there's trash there's Spirits that's why we got to throw out the trash in the natural just like in the spiritual because there's Spirits what trash the trash that comes and the devil throws that's in my mind I can throw out all that stuff out I'm guilty of a lot of things that the preacher said this morning so I'm dumping it out today I don't want it God fill me with love fill me with the thing that makes me love the bitterest enemy I've got I really want it Lord when you truly wanted you're desperate God has to answer you God give me of that love that perfect love to love my bitterest enemy the brother that offended the sister that offended me oh Lord many times it's not even like that it's the mind that's play tricks in our mind that you think you've got something against your brother but it's the devil just playing with your mind we've got to say Lord I just want to throw the trash out that's in my mind I want to take out the trash I want to love my brother and now I'm about to be closing the prophet says we we hear this cry on the radio and in different places and coming from sincere hearts Lord give us a Revival in our time oh amen amen I remember when I was a little younger we had Services uh wonderful Supernatural ones I believe there's many Elders here that can tell talk about the the Miracles the Wonders over there in Filmore I remember being in church on a Wednesday it didn't matter who was the pre just a simple message and the altar was full of people and people would dismiss but there'll be 15 20 people at the altar people already left an hour after service is over and me even being there crying out no music no nothing going on in the service and then suddenly a supernatural Wind come God is my witness you could hear a wind and it swept everyone to The Altar and people were squirming around like a w that's Supernatural after a service that's a Revival oh Brothers not what we need we need a killing to go back to those times of a Revival because the bride is getting ready when I saw that man when there was a man the prophet said where's that Revival LA and then there was a policeman that he was swinging his keys sir can you help me find that Revival he said yes you're looking at it I am the Revival and that should be us I should be that Revival you should be that Revival to get so close it doesn't matter what's happening in church whatever is happening in the world there should be a Revival in you it doesn't matter what's happening you're hearing you You' got your eyes on Jesus Christ no matter what comes I am the Revival Lord give us a Revival in our time and from letters and Christians around the world we hear that cry it does something to your heart it's inspiring it's uplifting it's quickening to the soul toar hear the people of the Lord call for a Revival and God has made us a promise if the people that are called by my name shall assemble themselves and pray then I'll hear from heaven and so we tonight we want to think on that and remember in the midst of all this cry God cannot send a Revival till he's got men in shape to take it there's got to be men men fearlessly men in shape to receive that Revival God cannot send a Revival until he has men in cons to take it we cannot have a Revival until we get men God called men God trained men that's not trained up in schools of Theology and education but rugged men of faith that God has brought up in the school of his rugged train men who are not afraid to face the fire man who has come in the presence of God and knows his power and knows his omnipotence and knows his healing power some men that's trained to know the Living God it's right to train them by the word but the letter kill it the spirit giveth life and before we can have this revival God has to call out and train men God trained men to carry this message and they don't care what the opposition is they're willing to go to the fiery furnace in defeat or to the Lions do or wherever it might be they're ready to go to go because they've been in the presence of God and they know what he is whether it's to Victory or defeat they still stand the same that's the kind of training God does to men it's very strange to think that God would do that that God trains his men like that but he does it how many of you believe that that before God can send us a Revival there's got to be men rugged men of faith it doesn't matter what come but those men have entered in God's presence it doesn't matter if they go to the furnace to the Lion's Den they're not afraid to go to save the souls God trained men that they're in their post of doing that take this word and when the Revival comes these men they're ready to grab that Revival so the revival can stay with us God cannot send them if if there's not men that are ready ready to take that Revival men that are ready I ask the question unto the men are you ready men with courage to take the Revival to grab and take that Revival please stand brothers that Revival is to take out all the trash that's in our mind that we've got in our spiritual homes I don't know if you remember when the prophet when he spoke to the little fish the prophet says like this now I looked at this little fish the prophet was fishing and he was there in the midst of many brothers there was a little fish with his gills all turned inside out of that fish fish and what is a fish a fish is you and I you remember when Jesus encountered Peter and Peter he was a fisherman said I'm no longer going to make you a fisherman of fish but a fisherman of men so then the little fish that that's you and I the prophet saw that this little fish with his little belly coming out of his mouth and the prophet says he saw him upon the trash this little fish you and I with everything came out of no hope for us they've been cast out out thr away they threw you away you're good for nothing your organs have come out of you you're in the church but the prophet was there the prophet was there the prophet says I was sitting there looking at that little fish laying back in the trash there on the water it been dead for some half hour his little belly out of its mouth his gills had done turned white and I was fishing there now this can seem fiction but the truth is more Stranger Than Fiction and as I looked at this little fellow just then coming down the hollow in the
