our visitors or our members everyone that's we try and speak only your word everything else is trash but we come here speaking your word we [Music] and thou shalt say unto pharaoh thus says the lord israel is my son even my firstborn [Music] and i say unto thee let my son go that he may serve me and thou and if thou refuse to let him go behold i will slay thy son even thy firstborn [Music] amen now those are those are pretty uh interesting words there yes that the lord tells pharaoh okay let my people go uh pueblo sinoloasis i'm going to kill your firstborn material oh that's a warning isn't it man come before before god and god tells you that you better listen you better listen to the word we're uh we're speaking today on exodus uh this is the fourth uh message as a subtitle i wrote down uh moses and pharaoh i thought that was pretty interesting i wanted to give a review of what we've spoken was in the desert land of midian hurting his flock he was said to inherit his father-in-law's possessions he had so moses was doing pretty good on his own he had a wife and a son esposa but he saw the burning bush he's changed everything yes that's changed his life he had no choice now our yeah and he couldn't put it aside anymore he must have thought of all those things that his mom told him he was born for a purpose he had a special task to do in his life all those thoughts must have come back to him once he had met god when he met god the burning bush he showed him a couple of uh of of uh tokens the rod turned into a snake being the type of the judge serpent he was to get it by the tail and it would turn back into a rock is doesn't he tried to serve the lord his own way he went out and killed pence no one followed him instead they accused them so iran that's just the way i am i've always liked to go camping it's nice to sit out there by a lake just watch nature it's a very relaxing atmosphere but moses was called for a purpose now let's let's uh let's see what moses told god when he met him i told him but i i can't even speak i started and it's all right well aaron's on his way so what else well they won't believe me so okay well i'll show you some science he ran out of excuses so here he goes on his way but he forgot one thing he forgot to circumcise his own son i think that's also a type we try and go and help everyone [Music] how can we be a light to the world in darkness in our own home podemos how can we want to go out and evangelize and travel and do things when our own home is falling his wife helped them and uh i got a uh some question here uh there's a question on questions and answers number two uh please explain exodus 24 the fourth chapter and the 24th verse what does this scripture mean the god aimed to kill moses or his son and why we know where that's at exodus 4 24. that's a good question here we'll read it right here just a moment exodus 4 24. you can take out your bibles and look at it and it came to pass by the way in the end that the lord met him and sought to kill him now god gave abraham generations before moses the sign of circumcision and that was a covenant that god made that every jew should be circumcised is that right every man should be that's a sign of and we are circumcised today with the holy spirit not by flesh no no god gave this commandment and every male must be circumcised and god when he called moses to go down there and deliver the children of israel moses hadn't performed on his own sons the very delivering sign would be like me saying all the church now every one of you you come in and be baptized here with water and we put you on the church membership is we're all going to glory together why brother that's not scripture hermano is unless you are born again circumcised of the holy spirit you've got to be us i don't care how good you are in except you as an individual has been born again by the holy ghost except except you as an individual has been born again by the holy ghost you'll never go in the rapture okay except that's the very delivering sign the circumcision and the circumcision is by the holy spirit now god the the questioner asks this does does the scripture mean that god ain't to kill moses or his son and why sometimes our wives gets us out of trouble right now sometimes our wives are our our right hand this is foreign was the only one that saved him there is got a sharp rock and went and cut the foreskin of her baby and threw it before moses and sent our bloody husband to me is that right and god would have took moses life but perhaps an angel was standing there said sephiroth catch it quickly went and circumcised the baby said moses you're so concerned about everything else and about your journey that your own boy hasn't been circumcised [Music] they both had a character right there separate was kind of kind of rough and so was moses now let's go to exodus 5 1. and afterwards moses and aaron went in and told pharaoh thus says the lord god of israel let my people go that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness and pearl said who is the lord that i should obey his voice to let israel go respond israel i know not the lord neither will i let israel go jono i know not the lord neither will i let israel go giovanni you have a man of god promised birth coming before a man that did not know god miniendo ante a some do you remember the story that brother bran tells us about the man who had a sign on his chest or in his front so let's see what pharaoh does when when told to let israel go aura as soon as he hurt the first time he had the jews there for 400 plus years did not know who joseph was yes jose enslaved all of israel he was a top gun of the world at that time he was a man no one was above him that he know [Music] so when he heard to let the people go he took off the straws for israel to make bricks without them israel had to go run out and get stubbles or whatever they can find but let's backtrack a little bit before moses and aaron went before pharaoh first went to the elders and told the elders showed the so moses and aaron were sent back to them foreign tell them everything was going to be fine foreign and they complain exodus 7 1. exodus and the lord said unto moses see i have made thee a god to pharaoh and aaron thy brother shall be a prophet thou shalt speak all that i command thee and aaron thy brother shall speak unto pharaoh that he send the children of israel out of this land and i will hearten pharaoh's heart and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of didn't even really have a chance he was raised to pause pharaoh was shown a miracle aaron's rod turned to a serpent but so did the magicians turn a rod into a serpent moses so do these also resist the truth men are corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith is so aaron's rod that had turned into a snake swallowed up the others now the next day at the river in rio they turned the river red the river turned into red as blood dig wells to get water and what did pharaoh do in case of our own he just went into his house then another warning to pearl but he refused so the land was full of frogs and the magicians did the same thing prairie then called moses and asked them to remove the frogs yeah i find this really interesting moses goes and tells okay when do you want the raw frogs removed you would think he would have said immediately you're two three feet deep in frogs and you say well but the magicians could not bring forth lies they were now convinced it was the finger of god exodus 8 18. and the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lies but they could not so there were lies upon man and upon beasts then the magician said unto pearl this is the finger of god and pharaoh's heart was hardened and he hearkened not unto them as the lord had said entonces is then wanted to let the people go but as soon as the flies were removed he changed his heart he changed his mind i wonder if some people are like that when something happens i'll serve you this time yes i'll be for real this time they're healed they're giving what they want and they're gone they're gone isn't that something we've seen it throughout the year es alo que mos vistas let's read a little bit of the message let's prove that there was no nothing happening in gershon egypt was being was being hammered they were being hurt but in gerson everything was called the ever-present water from the rock and israel as a historical type had to take this chastisement now when they were down in egypt and god sent moses and he stretched forth the rod and flies and lies come on the ground he stretched forward forth forward to forward to four towards the sun sexton diocea el sol and it went down it stretched it over the waters and they turned to blood why israel was over in canaan's over in goshen just having a glorious time establishing tiempo glorioso the sun never went down just like you did when you first got saved everything the birds sang different and everybody was sweet i know my how everything was just dandy when you first got saved then come the trying time the sanctifying time laying aside the ways that those does so easily besets you the spoken you a man have to stop your smoking you're drinking stop you're going to the pool room your all-night car parties all those things you had to sanctify yourself from them by the faith in the blood of jesus christ sanctifying yourself santificano you women have to let your hair grow out lengthen your dresses and act like different than what you was sanctifying time many times they would rebel and go back muchas versus see a child of god looks straight at calvary and knows that's it for his good isabel that is for his own good ques why do you do all those things someone good you have to bring it home so then the process of time there's where the great falling away when this great crowding in time then the people began to fall away from one side to the other side then in the shading well we wish we were back down in egypt our [Music] in other words if i would take it historically now that's what they said i was out drinking all night it was out smoking partying now in the modern day it would be oh every wednesday night prayer meeting the same thing the preachers stand up and preach sons go on back see then you're just going as a line of duty you're not a worshiper a worshiper goes there to worship to express himself before yeah questions and answers uh 5307 29. now look back in the old testament when you see the plagues falling they were in egypt and god was bringing his people out to the promised land is that right and israel never received one plague israel no mosquitoes come no frogs was there no lies was there no storms was there no lightning was there no killing on the cattle was there and everything they had was preserved in goshen listen to this real carefully okay our presidency is that right it's the type of the church going just before the tribulation period is jesus said when these things begin to come to pass jesus christ lift up your head for your redemption is dying in christ jesus is the holy spirit guiding us taking care of us today we will be okay then they said that go ahead and read it and said a man run hide themselves in the and fall upon their sought to kill themselves and couldn't do it and everything i believe that takes the place just before the tribulation los ambres causes the tribulation comes just an ordinary church without the holy ghost goes through the tribulation period it's only the leg that goes through los alex okay then what happens next back to the story is the boils were on the egyptians and the magicians exodus 9 13 exodus and the lord said unto moses rise up early in the morning and stand before pharaoh and say unto him thus says the lord god of the hebrews let my people go that they may serve me entonces for i will act for i will act this time send all my plagues upon thy heart and upon thy servants and upon thy people that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth for now i will stretch out my hand that i may smite thee and thy people with pestilence and thou shall be cut off from the earth and in every deed for this cause have i raised the up for to show in thee thy my power and that my name may be declared through all the earth imagine being a pharaoh and being known through all the earth all through history [Music] be known throughout history the biggest toughest baddest man in the world el tipo mas grande porto del mundo against my people and that will not let them go behold tomorrow about this time i will cause it to rain a very grievous hell such as hell not been in egypt since the foundation thereof even until now send therefore now and gather thy cattle and all that thou hast in the field for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field and shall not be brought home the hill shall come down upon them and they shall die and via puerto rico porque get the hell shall fall thunder and hell with fire those who feared the word of the lord brought everything inside their homes but in gerson there was nothing after that the pharaoh the pharaoh refused god you still refuse he darkness fell for three days that could be felt inevitable but there was light at gerson and all the first born in the land of jesus shall die no the first born in the land of egypt shall die from the firstborn of pharaoh that sitteth upon this throne even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill and all the first born of beasts and there shall be a great crime throughout all the land of egypt such as there was none like it nor shall be like it anymore when the rapture takes place what do you think is going to happen to those left behind from the house what crime will you be hearing we won't hear it but the cry of the people pueblo knowing that they had an opportunity they had an opportunity to go before god and ask for forgiveness but against any of the children of israel shall not adopt movies against man or beast destiny that the lord does put a difference between egypt and israel the difference between egypt and israel the difference between a believer and a non-believer we are the outballs we are the outcome we are the weird ones that go to church we are the believers of the message of the hours we're different than everyone else we know where we're going we're not worried no no we're prepared we're preparing ourselves to live nos estamos preparano paranos [Applause] and the lord spake unto moses and aarons in the land of egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months saying in the tenth day of this month shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for a house family and if the house will be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next unto him unto his house take it according to the number of the souls pasta every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb conformed your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year ye shall take it out from the she or from the goats animals and ye shall keep it up until the 14th day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it in the evening they shall take the blood and they shall eat the flesh in the night rolls with fire assad and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs eat not his head with his legs and with his pertinent zero there's something that my daughter told me the other day i was telling brother emmanuel about it and i thought this was interesting my daughter said me see genesis goes all the way through revelation right now if we look at revelations chapter 10 verse 8. apocalypse and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey if we are and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter entonces is more difficult it's really hard more difficult but as long as we want to live it that's the difference whether we want to live the world i'll i'll save the token i was going to speak on the token but a couple of things i'm running out of time and then i'm running and once we eat it up then the word of god is in us the life of christ in us so when christ comes around in the rapture enthusiasm it only comes and takes what is attracted to that magnet when christ comes he's coming back for this if this is enough we're my daughter told me that and i told the brother and i said well yeah i heard that one and thou shalt eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and ye shall eat it in haste it's the lord's passover i will pass through the land of egypt this night and i will smite all the firsts born in the land of egypt but man and beasts both men and beasts and against all the gods of egypt i will execute judgment i am the lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are and when i see the black i will pass over you the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when i spit the land of egypt in las casas next time around we'll we'll get into the the message the token and the token talks about this subject and i think the token is a tremendous message no token is something we have to apply in our lives without it you're a part of egypt you're a part of christ domingo because the word of god says let every man be a liar and the word of god be the truth so if i say anything contrary to the word of god stick to amen we ask you to remember uh brother uh marco santana he's in california thank the lord that brother michael rodriguez and family and brother marcos came back from nebraska rodriguez marco santana nebraska they ran into some snow out there and we're looking forward to the meetings coming up right now in a little bit when we uh turn up to youtube on youtube i'll come back and we'll talk a little bit more could you please buy your heads for a word of prayer your word is an everlasting word it doesn't change you know cambia we know that your word teaches us types and shadows we see what happened in history [Music] how we can apply for today como podemos so we can see a little bit of what's coming up thank you lord for those words thank you lord for the message of the hour that opens up this word unto us and if there's anyone here that has not accepted the lord jesus christ i ask them to run accept [Music] before the death angel came ante [Music] we must get under that blood before the death angel comes in our time once the rapture takes place the doors are closed there's no more opportunity [Music] [Music] last opportunity comes but for today our doors are open we can come before you lord senor podemos venir [Music] i pray [Music] [Music] all these things in the precious name of the lord jesus christ thank you many graces [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] the [Music] [Music] and i know are angels all around let us [Music] we are standing [Music] [Music] as i walk through the door i sent this present [Music] and i knew this was the place where love abounds [Music] for we are the dead [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] jesus now [Music] is [Music] my [Music] [Music] for me

[Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] is if we can pray for each and every one of us [Music] [Music] your word has been spoken and we've [Music] there was a group of people singing to the stars and and that time that's how we worship you and i have a thought that in that time when the saints sing and worship to the lord [Music] [Music] and we just asked that we may be come together once more [Music] the life is so fast and so short [Music] and i want to dedicate the my prayer to the youth and i ask that if any of them feel necessity that they need of you and they know they need of you lord i just ask that you made you may do your work in their body and mine [Music] for the services that are coming up for the youth may your name be glorified through these young people for they are the strength of the future you may be with us and the church as well may you keep us in the palm of your hand throughout this week [Music] and to be with each and every one
