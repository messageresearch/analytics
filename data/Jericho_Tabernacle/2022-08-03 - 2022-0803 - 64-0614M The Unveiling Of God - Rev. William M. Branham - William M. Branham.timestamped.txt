[1:56] this message the unveiling of god
[1:59] by brother william marion branham was
[2:02] delivered on sunday morning june 14 1964
[2:06] at the branham tabernacle in
[2:07] jeffersonville indiana usa
[2:13] hermano william marion branham foreign
[2:30] let us remain standing just a moment
[2:31] while we bow our heads for prayer
[2:33] permanent
[2:39] our gracious lord
[2:41] we are indeed grateful today for this
[2:44] privilege that we have of assembling
[2:46] ourselves together
[2:47] upon the earth
[2:49] before the coming of the lord.
[3:02] may we examine our hearts today by thy
[3:05] word
[3:06] and see if we are in the faith
[3:09] that we might be ready that
[3:11] the hour of his appearing
[3:24] that we should be as the scripture has
[3:27] said would be
[3:28] caught up together with those who are
[3:31] asleep and meet the lord in the air and
[3:34] forever be with him
[3:44] yes
[3:46] we thank thee for the true
[3:49] christian spirit that's still in the
[3:51] world
[3:52] among the people
[3:54] that they still believe thee and i word
[4:07] so we asked your blessings upon us today
[4:10] that you'll
[4:11] shout out to each one of us that which
[4:14] we have need of that we might be watered
[4:17] by the word
[4:19] that we might grow into
[4:21] instruments of use in thy hands for this
[4:25] last day
[4:43] for we ask this in the name of the lord
[4:46] jesus christ our great shepherd
[4:48] that we are looking to appear
[4:51] amen
[4:53] says
[5:06] and i want to say that i deemed this a
[5:08] grand privilege this morning
[5:10] of being here again and sorry that we
[5:13] don't have the adequate seating room
[5:26] and
[5:27] we are going to try tonight now to have
[5:29] prayer for the sick.
[5:36] today this morning it would be a little
[5:38] hard and
[5:39] and i was going to tape this message
[5:41] today
[5:49] the lord seemed to
[5:51] deal with me concerning it all a month
[5:54] or two ago
[5:55] and it's along
[6:01] respect
[6:05] he is largo and i don't have the time
[6:08] out in the meetings because we allow
[6:10] that to 30 40 minutes of service
[6:19] and is
[6:20] we uh
[6:21] because of the people having to go to
[6:23] work and things i found it better if i
[6:26] make my messages short entonces nosotros
[6:36] and
[6:37] they didn't have time out there to
[6:39] record it so i thought i'd just wait
[6:41] till i got to the tabernacle here
[6:43] and then record it from here
[6:46] on time
[6:54] and it's a little lengthy and i know
[6:56] you're standing and i i'm going to hurry
[6:59] just as fast as i can
[7:08] and now you won't bother me if you
[7:10] switch in seats or whatever more that'll
[7:12] that'll be perfectly all right with me
[7:14] because this is a special day that we
[7:16] just make these recordings
[7:28] special
[7:31] and
[7:32] so we got great reports from what the
[7:34] lord has done out in the field but we'll
[7:36] probably give more of that tonight when
[7:38] we can give more time to it have more
[7:41] time to give
[7:56] and now we trust that the lord will
[7:59] bless each one of you
[8:05] i know your hearts are full of joy
[8:08] looking for the coming of the lord
[8:15] and mine also bubbling over to see
[8:18] things happening the way they are
[8:26] and
[8:27] national strife and the church in the
[8:29] condition it's in and see the signs of
[8:32] his coming
[8:33] both physically and spiritually
[8:37] nationalism
[8:46] and knowing that this time of his
[8:49] appearing is so close it just fills our
[8:52] heart with joy to know that we're going
[8:55] to be changed one of these days we're
[8:58] going to be changed in these creatures
[9:00] that we are is
[9:05] implementing
[9:15] now i believe if i understand they got a
[9:18] telephone
[9:19] or hookup somewhere this message is
[9:21] going into phoenix and to uh
[9:24] and to different parts by
[9:27] telephone aura
[9:32] apart
[9:40] and so now we trust that if that's so i
[9:43] don't know i just told that for coming
[9:45] in
[9:53] and all the people out there are really
[9:55] enjoying good health and and the glory
[9:58] of the lord upon them
[10:08] and now
[10:10] now we're going to open the word of the
[10:16] lord and what we are all here for is to
[10:20] enjoy ourselves and to take heed to what
[10:23] we are it is
[10:30] we never come here and we're no one
[10:33] that's present knows that any man was
[10:35] set in this
[10:36] heat like this and just to the idea of
[10:39] being here amen
[11:06] that's all we can do
[11:08] is to believe the lord jesus is with us
[11:11] and we're here to to walk closer with
[11:14] him
[11:25] now
[11:26] this heat's a little hard on me i kind
[11:28] of got customized to that dry heat out
[11:31] there in tucson which is
[11:33] uh the humidity here now our heat there
[11:35] is much hotter than this
[11:37] but uh
[11:38] it's uh dry
[11:40] hora
[11:55] our humidity sometime is one twentieth
[11:59] of one percent maybe something like that
[12:01] just almost like living under an oxygen
[12:04] tent
[12:13] but
[12:14] here it's got the
[12:17] moisture in it and it makes you just
[12:19] kind of
[12:21] feel all rung out as we used to
[12:34] so it's uh hard on him so i know that
[12:37] and you mothers are the little babies
[12:39] and you
[12:40] people standing old and young and placed
[12:42] together
[12:44] like you are in tonses
[12:57] and now we're we're hoping that god will
[13:01] reward you richly for your sacrifice
[13:10] i understand that brother roy borders is
[13:12] here somewhere i
[13:14] heard him announce but i guess maybe he
[13:16] couldn't get in
[13:18] tending
[13:26] all right that's the manager of the
[13:28] meetings
[13:31] administrators
[13:35] now we are
[13:37] also want to announce that one that used
[13:40] to be among us uh went to be with the
[13:42] lord this morning a man brother jackson
[13:45] from sturgis michigan
[13:58] no one knows how it went or what about
[14:00] it he was just doing fine and it just i
[14:02] think they found him dead or something
[14:13] i didn't get the full detail of it
[14:17] and we are very grateful to god that
[14:20] brother jackson was a christian yes
[14:26] i haven't seen him for several years but
[14:28] he set among us and he's one of us god
[14:31] rest his gallant souls
[14:42] going like that we believe that maybe
[14:44] that it was something that it was time
[14:47] for him to go well
[14:54] the lord never warned us of it or him
[14:57] just
[15:17] and we all want to give thanks to god

[15:41] for the sick tonight and i'll speak more
[15:44] about on the sick tonight

[17:47] senor jesus
[17:52] and in this troublesome hour that we're
[17:54] living
[17:56] nation against nation
[17:58] pestilence earthquakes in many places
[18:02] man's hearts failing fear
[18:05] we see the handwriting on the wall
[18:24] now that is in the natural realm that
[18:26] all the world should see this
[18:33] but now there is a spiritual realm also
[18:37] and we see the great happenings and we
[18:39] want to speak of them today
[18:52] bless our word to our heart
[18:57] we know that there's no
[18:59] man in heaven or in earth is worthy to
[19:02] take this book
[19:03] to lose the seals are to look up on it
[19:06] even
[19:16] but there was one
[19:17] appeared a slaying lamb
[19:20] bloody
[19:21] that came and took the book and was
[19:24] worthy and able to open it
[19:35] oh
[19:36] lamb of god
[19:38] open thy word to our hearts today
[19:42] for comfort
[19:49] and consuelo we are your servants

[19:58] anything that would keep the word from
[20:00] going forth with great power and
[20:02] influence today on our lives take it
[20:05] away lord any hindrance that we might
[20:08] have full access to all the blessings
[20:10] promised to us through thy word
[20:17] influenza
[20:30] we asked it in jesus name amen
[20:33] lopez
[20:35] jesus
[20:36] amen
[20:38] philippians 2
[20:40] philippines
[20:41] if there be therefore any consolation in
[20:44] christ
[20:46] if any comfort of love if any fellowship
[20:50] of the spirit if any vowels of mercy
[20:57] algun consuelo di amoros
[21:00] espiritu
[21:05] fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded
[21:10] having the same
[21:12] love
[21:14] being a one a card
[21:16] of one mind completed
[21:28] let nothing be done through strife or
[21:30] vain glory
[21:32] but in lowliness of mind let each esteem
[21:35] the other better than themselves
[21:48] look not every man to his own things
[21:51] but
[21:52] every man also on the things of others
[22:04] let this mind be in you which also was
[22:06] in christ jesus
[22:12] jesus who being in the form of god
[22:16] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[22:19] god
[22:26] but made
[22:27] himself of no repetitions and took upon
[22:31] him the form of a servant
[22:35] and was made in the likeness of man
[22:46] and being found
[22:48] in fashion of a man he humbled himself
[22:52] and became obedient to death even the
[22:55] death of the cross
[23:07] now if we shall turn now over to
[23:11] second corinthians the third chapter
[23:14] we will
[23:16] begin with the sixth verse
[23:19] and reading this
[23:21] to the 18th and down to part of the
[23:25] fourth chapter
[23:38] who also has made us able ministers of
[23:42] the new testament
[23:44] not of the letter
[23:47] but of the spirit for the letter killeth
[23:51] but the spirit giveth life
[24:05] but if the administration of death
[24:07] written and engraved in stones was
[24:10] glorious so that the children of israel
[24:12] could not steadfast behold the face of
[24:15] moses for the glory of his countenance
[24:20] which glory was to be done away
[24:30] from
[24:37] how shall not the ministration of the
[24:40] spirit be rather glorious
[24:43] bien con gloria ministerio del espiritu
[24:46] for if the ministration of condemnation
[24:48] be glorious
[24:50] much more does the administration of
[24:54] righteousness exceed in glory for
[24:57] question
[25:05] or even that which was made glorious has
[25:08] no glory in this respect
[25:11] by reasons of the glory that excelif
[25:24] or if that which is done away was gloria
[25:27] much more
[25:29] hath which remaineth his glory
[25:36] gloria
[25:37] mucho mas glorioso
[25:41] seeing then that we have such a hope we
[25:44] must
[25:45] uh greatly
[25:47] plainness of speech
[25:49] use great plainness of speech
[26:00] and not as moses which put a veil over
[26:03] his face that the children of israel
[26:06] could not steadfastly look to the end
[26:09] of that which was abolished
[26:21] but
[26:22] they're minds were blinded for until
[26:27] this day remains the same veil untaken
[26:30] away in the reading of the old testament
[26:34] which baal is done away in christ
[26:52] but even unto this day when moses is
[26:55] read the veil is upon their hearts
[27:02] he says
[27:06] when it shall be turned to the lord the
[27:10] veil shall be taken away
[27:17] now the lord is that spirit
[27:21] and we're the spirit of the lord
[27:24] there is liberty
[27:34] but we all with open face beholding as
[27:38] in a glass the glory
[27:41] of the lord has changed into the same
[27:44] image from glory unto glory even as by
[27:48] the spirit of the lord
[27:55] gloria del signor
[27:57] transformative glory and glory
[28:03] therefore seeing we have this ministry
[28:06] as we have received mercy we faint not
[28:14] record
[28:21] see hidden things
[28:24] and the
[28:25] dishonest
[28:26] not walking and craftiness
[28:28] and handling the word of god deceitfully
[28:32] but by
[28:33] manifestation of the truth
[28:37] condemning
[28:39] ourselves to
[28:41] every man's conscience in the side of
[28:44] god
[28:55] manifestation
[29:02] but if our gospel be hid it is hid to
[29:05] them which are lost
[29:09] [Music]
[29:14] may the lord
[29:15] add his blessings to the reading of his
[29:18] word
[29:23] now
[29:24] my subject this morning
[29:27] i trust that god will reveal this
[29:36] and each time if you who take the tapes
[29:38] and listen
[29:40] and i hope and trust that
[29:44] that
[29:45] you have had a spiritual understanding
[29:49] of what that god has been if trying to
[29:53] get over to the church without saying it
[29:56] right out see
[29:58] us
[30:15] we have to say things in such a way
[30:18] that it might
[30:20] thin down it might
[30:22] bring some to go out some to leave
[30:25] and some to
[30:26] to
[30:28] to ponder over
[30:34] manera
[30:44] but that's done purposely
[30:46] it must be done that way
[30:48] peru
[30:53] then it might be that some would say you
[30:55] mean god would purposely do a thing like
[30:58] that
[30:59] says
[31:11] he said one day when he had thousands
[31:13] around him he said
[31:16] uh
[31:17] except you eat of the flesh of the son
[31:20] of god a son of man and drink his blood
[31:23] you have no life in you
[31:25] until
[31:30] comes
[31:37] what kind of a statement do you think
[31:39] that a medical doctor or nurse or any
[31:42] fine intellectual person would think of
[31:44] a statement like that for a man that had
[31:46] a ministry like he had
[31:49] declaration
[31:54] intellectual
[31:55] declaration
[31:58] el ministerio
[32:00] why he would say eat the flesh that's
[32:02] cannibal
[32:03] to drink human blood it's a vampire
[32:08] comedy
[32:14] in other words he wants us to be
[32:16] cannibals and vampires
[32:23] and the whole audience walked away from
[32:26] him
[32:29] and there was a ministerial association
[32:32] with him of 70 that have been chosen
[32:41] and he turned to them and he said
[32:43] uh
[32:45] what will you think
[32:46] when you see the son of man ascending up
[32:50] from where he came from
[33:00] now he didn't explain that he never
[33:03] explained how paul did that later on he
[33:06] just said it
[33:08] no
[33:20] he said what will you say to these
[33:21] ministers when you see the son of man
[33:23] ascending up from where he come from
[33:34] no doubt that man said now just a moment
[33:38] oh we eat with him we fish with him we
[33:41] sleep with him
[33:47] oh no
[33:52] we know where he was born we've seen the
[33:54] cradle that he he was rocked in
[33:56] and uh
[33:58] how does this man this is a hard saying
[34:12] and the bible said they didn't walk with
[34:14] him anymore they left him
[34:17] john van daven connell
[34:24] you chose 12 and one of them was the
[34:26] devil he said
[34:29] you know
[34:32] so he turned
[34:44] how are they going to eat his flesh and
[34:46] drink his blood
[35:02] and they turned to the apostles he said
[35:05] uh do you want to go also
[35:14] and that's when the apostle peter made
[35:16] that great statement lord to whom would
[35:19] we go
[35:28] ahead
[35:30] or we are satisfied we know surely that
[35:34] you and you alone have the word of life
[35:36] of this house
[35:38] and we're satisfied of that
[35:42] concern
[35:57] you can't explain faith
[35:59] it's something that you
[36:01] believe
[36:03] and it's so solid that there's nothing
[36:05] else will take its place
[36:16] therefore they know that the word that
[36:19] was written for that age that they were
[36:21] living in the messiahic age
[36:24] that he fit that place exactly
[36:38] in this and what could they do to go
[36:41] back in them coal formal churches that
[36:44] they come out of
[36:47] iglesias
[36:51] said where would we go
[37:12] and they they couldn't explain it
[37:15] but they believed it
[37:24] and jesus said that to weed down his
[37:27] crown
[37:28] see so he could get the group together
[37:37] and out of all those people
[37:40] they only have 11 of them then
[37:43] understood actually who he was
[38:04] now
[38:06] my subject this morning is to reveal
[38:09] or unveil
[38:12] that god aura
[38:15] is
[38:21] god has always in every age
[38:25] has hid behind the veil
[38:28] all ages
[38:30] but he's been god all the time
[38:43] but he's kept himself hid from the world
[38:47] and reveals himself to his elected like
[38:51] the apostles at that day
[38:53] embargo
[38:55] del mundo is
[39:01] now that was god's speaking in christ
[39:08] now man has always it's been the nature
[39:12] of man he sought to see physically that
[39:16] god
[39:25] is
[39:45] and we found in africa different forms
[39:48] of animals and so forth
[39:51] in africa different
[39:53] animals see the
[39:54] mass then up the totem poles in alaska
[39:57] and and different farms that they think
[40:00] this god is in yeah
[40:03] in alaska
[40:08] just paul spoke there at athens that
[40:12] time on mars hill
[40:14] and i told him if they were
[40:15] superstitious
[40:17] concerning this unknown god that they
[40:19] know he was there but yet they didn't
[40:22] know him
[40:37] and uh so we find even back as far as
[40:40] job
[40:42] job knew that there was a god
[40:46] he knew it yeah
[40:48] [Music]
[40:54] and there's not a
[40:55] a human being in their right mind but
[40:58] what knows there's got to be something
[41:01] somewhere
[41:02] in existence
[41:17] i want you to notice
[41:18] the form that god chose to talk to job
[41:26] god was veiled when he talked to jobs
[41:45] you believe that god still comes
[41:53] there's several settings here a number
[41:56] that was with us the other day when he
[41:57] came in a whirlwind
[42:00] ibario sentados
[42:07] told us the day before brother banks
[42:09] woodstown when he said take up this rock
[42:11] throw it up in the air and say thus
[42:12] saith the lord
[42:14] you will see it right away
[42:29] and i picked up the rock up on top of
[42:31] the mountain threw it up in the air and
[42:33] the course coming down it started to
[42:35] whirlwind see the suction of it
[42:39] is
[42:48] you have to do something
[42:51] to call something to follow it
[42:58] jesus took a piece of bread and broke it
[43:01] then multiplied from that piece of bread
[43:04] jesus
[43:10] he took water poured it into a pitcher
[43:14] agua
[43:17] elijah tucked salt
[43:19] put it in a cruise
[43:20] cut down a stick throw it on the water
[43:23] elias
[43:34] and
[43:35] picking up this rock and throwing it
[43:37] into the air and coming down started the
[43:40] whirlwind
[43:48] the next day while there was a minister
[43:50] with us on a hunting trip aldia
[43:52] siguiente
[43:57] he was standing close and
[43:59] uh he said to me does the lord give
[44:01] visions out like this brother branham
[44:19] and
[44:19] just then the vision came
[44:22] in
[44:25] brother borders i think he's outside now
[44:27] he was along
[44:29] borders
[44:33] brother banks woods i think in
[44:35] several was up there
[44:39] eight or ten
[44:40] hermano banks woods
[44:45] yes and brother banks wood's watching
[44:47] for this right on the mountain right
[44:49] across from exactly about one half mile
[44:52] where the seven angels appeared that i
[44:54] left here to go there for
[44:56] uh come back and told the about the
[44:58] seven seals
[45:00] hermano banks woods is
[45:16] just about a half a mile from then
[45:21] and then the next day when this was
[45:22] going on
[45:24] while the
[45:25] uh i said to brother this brother i said
[45:28] what's your trouble you've got an
[45:29] allergy in your eye
[45:41] the doctors has tried for a couple years
[45:43] to stop it and they can't do
[45:55] and i said but don't worry the lord
[45:58] jesus has honored your faith
[46:00] and he just dropped his gun
[46:04] jesus
[46:06] implemented
[46:08] and i said your mother just what she was
[46:12] and what was wrong with her and he said
[46:13] that's the truth
[46:22] brother roy roberson from the church
[46:24] here standing present i guess all of you
[46:26] know him
[46:32] knowing he was a veteran and knowing
[46:34] what was going to take place i put my
[46:35] hand on his shoulder i said brother
[46:37] roberson be careful watch
[46:40] something's fixing to happen
[46:52] i walked back to where i was supposed to
[46:53] be standing and out of the air came a
[46:55] whirlwind down to a canyon from above
[46:58] that was so great until it tore rocks
[47:01] eight or ten inches of through out of
[47:03] the top of the mountain and threw them
[47:04] 200 yards out in regression
[47:18] and clapped three times like that and a
[47:21] voice came from
[47:28] all of them standing there
[47:30] brother banks present now came up so
[47:32] that was what you told me yesterday i
[47:33] said yes sir that's it
[47:46] he said uh what did it say i said now
[47:48] that's just for me to know brother
[47:49] banksy because
[48:09] a little few days later it hit in the
[48:10] ocean and you see what happened around
[48:12] fairbanks it was a judgment sign
[48:18] used
[48:23] now we find that
[48:26] that god
[48:27] still
[48:28] uh
[48:29] you see throw people into panics
[48:39] and so then they had that had to happen
[48:42] see it just has to happen
[48:51] the things that's got to happen got to
[48:53] happen anyhow it's going to happen
[48:55] anyhow
[49:03] moses one time
[49:05] desired to see god
[49:07] and god told him to stand on the rock
[49:12] certainly
[49:14] it
[49:19] moses stood and his scene god passed by
[49:23] and his back looked like the back of a
[49:25] man
[49:28] we said
[49:43] i guess you all see the picture out
[49:45] there the other day we stood by that
[49:46] same rock
[49:49] photography
[49:54] and here's that light the age of the
[49:56] lord right there
[50:11] jehovah of the old testament is jesus of
[50:15] the new testament
[50:20] jesus
[50:23] is the same god
[50:24] just changed in his form
[50:29] now someone said the other day a baptist
[50:32] minister out in tucson how can you say
[50:36] that
[50:37] jesus and god would be the same person
[50:51] i said well it's very easy if you just
[50:53] let your own thinking get away and think
[50:55] the bible terms of it
[51:06] they are the self-same being god is a
[51:09] spirit jesus is the body that he was
[51:11] bailed in
[51:20] i said like in my home
[51:22] to my wife i am her husband
[51:31] i have a young daughter rebecca i am her
[51:34] father
[51:39] and i have a grandson
[51:41] and his name is paul i am his
[51:44] grandfather
[51:46] is paul
[51:49] i am husband father and grandfather
[51:57] and my wife has no claims on me
[52:01] as
[52:02] father
[52:03] or grandfather
[52:04] she has claims on me alone as a husband
[52:15] and my daughter has no claims on me as
[52:18] husband
[52:20] or grandfather she is my child
[52:24] see
[52:25] me
[52:29] hey
[52:43] that's god father son and holy ghost
[52:46] is just the dispensation claims
[52:53] on manifestations
[52:56] god is saying the same god has
[53:11] if you notice your philippines he said
[53:13] not thinking it a robbery but tuck the
[53:17] form of man
[53:27] now the greek word there for that form
[53:30] i've been looking at it all day
[53:31] yesterday
[53:32] trying to think out what it was i find
[53:36] come with this word
[53:37] of
[53:38] a mafia
[53:51] is
[54:03] [Applause]
[54:08] i may pronounce that wrong
[54:10] but that reason i spell it whether the
[54:12] tape is released their people scholars
[54:14] will know what a i mean
[54:20] is
[54:29] that means that he changed his self
[54:33] he calmed down
[54:36] morphe
[54:41] now the greek word there means that
[54:44] something that could not be seen yet
[54:47] it's there
[54:48] and then it's changed and the eye can
[54:50] catch it
[55:04] like elijah was a dolphin
[55:09] see the the servant couldn't see all
[55:11] those angels around there
[55:13] and god just changed
[55:16] not brought the angels down
[55:18] but he changed the seeing of
[55:22] the servant
[55:31] los angeles
[55:35] and there was the mountains full of
[55:38] angels and fire and horses of fire
[55:41] chariots of fire all around his prophet
[55:45] establishment
[55:54] [Music]
[55:59] the thing is already there
[56:06] so that what i'm trying to say that god
[56:10] that always was is here
[56:21] the only thing he'd done when he become
[56:22] man he changed his mask
[56:35] he changed himself
[56:37] to what he was to what he is
[56:41] or his masked
[56:56] like in a great drama
[56:58] as i was
[57:00] uh speaking this morning kind of
[57:01] catching up on this of shakespeare it's
[57:04] been a long time
[57:08] actually
[57:10] shakespeare pasado mucho tiempo but when
[57:13] shakespeare wrote the
[57:15] the the drama the uh for a king james
[57:19] of england when he uh
[57:21] the character of macbeth
[57:24] pero quando
[57:34] see shakespeare did not believe in
[57:36] witches
[57:38] but uh uh in the play for the king did
[57:42] believe in witches so he had to include
[57:45] witches
[57:46] see beyonce
[57:49] [Music]
[57:52] and
[57:56] and now in order to do this they changed
[57:58] the cast
[58:03] becky here uh and carmen they acted that
[58:07] in the and the school where she just
[58:09] graduated a few weeks ago
[58:19] now
[58:20] maybe one person played three or four
[58:22] parts
[58:27] in order to do that
[58:29] he changed his mask
[58:36] sometimes he comes out he's this
[58:38] character
[58:39] and the next time he comes out he's
[58:41] another character but it is the same
[58:45] person
[58:47] all the time
[59:03] he changed himself from from a pillar
[59:06] fire
[59:07] to become a man
[59:13] then change himself from that back into
[59:15] spirit again
[59:16] that he might dwell in man
[59:25] god acting in man
[59:28] what he really was
[59:30] doing
[59:35] jesus christ was god acting in man
[59:40] in a man
[59:42] jesus christ
[59:54] it changed from the pillar of fire and
[59:57] then it come in which was a veil in the
[1:00:00] wilderness that hid god from
[1:00:03] israel
[1:00:12] israel moses seen the shape of his body
[1:00:16] but really he was hid all the time
[1:00:18] behind this pillar of fire which was the
[1:00:21] logos that went from god moises
[1:00:34] now
[1:00:35] we find here now since pentecost
[1:00:39] god is not acting
[1:00:42] uh in man or act and how he's acting
[1:00:45] through man
[1:00:58] he was acting in a man-man
[1:01:01] jesus now is acting through man that he
[1:01:04] is chosen for this purpose
[1:01:16] god in the form of man
[1:01:19] he changed himself from the form of of
[1:01:23] us of god to a form of man.
[1:01:36] he came in three names three sons names
[1:01:40] he came in the son name of the son
[1:01:43] of
[1:01:44] of man the son of david
[1:01:48] and the son of god
[1:01:50] three sons names
[1:02:04] i want to sing that just a moment real
[1:02:06] quietly in worship
[1:02:08] have thine own way lord
[1:02:10] have thine own way
[1:02:13] hold over my being absolute sway
[1:02:18] mow
[1:02:19] make me after thy will
[1:02:21] why i'm waiting yield it in still
[1:02:25] all together now in a way of worship
[1:02:28] have
[1:02:30] that own way now dedicate yourself to
[1:02:34] that song

[1:04:57] sisters that are always in prayer for
[1:04:59] the needs of the people
[1:05:04] contest

[1:05:20] god can even see the elderly sisters
[1:05:22] that are putting in their own part
[1:05:29] just like one time jesus was at the
[1:05:31] temple
[1:05:33] and he saw that this elderly woman
[1:05:37] just gave
[1:05:38] a little bit of money
[1:05:41] but that's all she had
[1:05:43] and jesus appreciated that much even
[1:05:45] more
[1:05:48] so let's give all that we have
[1:05:51] even though it's just a little bit
[1:05:54] because the lord appreciates it
[1:05:57] those are all the petitions and the
[1:05:58] thanksgivings that we have
[1:06:03] but we know that every one of us has a
[1:06:05] need
