[35:48] Saints can you hear
[35:52] okay it's good to be here
[35:55] tonight and we're thankful for the
[36:00] invitation if you have your Bible let's
[36:02] open the Bible to Acts chapter
[36:09] [Music]
[36:14] one and we'll read from uh verses um
[36:21] 6-9 when they therefore were come
[36:25] together they asked of him saying Lord
[36:28] will thou at this time restore the again
[36:30] the kingdom to
[36:39] Israel now these are some brothers that
[36:42] are looking at a resurrected being for
[36:44] the first time in
[36:50] history but they were humans just like
[36:54] us and the best thing they could think
[36:56] of was was a political
[37:02] question and he said unto them it is not
[37:04] for you to know the times or the seasons
[37:07] which the father had put in his own
[37:16] power but you shall receive power after
[37:18] the Holy Ghost has come upon
[37:25] you and you should shall be Witnesses
[37:28] here in Jerusalem over in Judea in
[37:31] Samaria and uttermost part of the
[37:40] Earth all the way to Phoenix Arizon
[37:44] phix the gospel didn't come in a
[37:49] parachute it came on a
[37:53] donkey there was man that came on foot
[37:56] over here to bring the
[38:01] gospel and we are the result of all that
[38:05] work let's pray precious Heavenly Father
[38:09] we thank you for your mercy to
[38:13] us we thank you for bringing us here
[38:18] safely we thank you for each one of your
[38:21] people that you brought into the
[38:22] Tabernacle
[38:25] here Lord we pray that you'd bless this
[38:28] small reading of your
[38:29] [Music]
[38:31] word give us Grace Lord as we speak the
[38:34] truth and
[38:37] love bless each one we ask in Jesus
[38:43] name amen you may be
[38:51] seated so I'm here for three
[38:55] reasons
[38:57] first of all brother oron invited
[39:01] me I thank you very
[39:04] much and number two I felt inspired of
[39:07] the Holy Ghost to be here
[39:12] today could have been here a long time
[39:16] ago but this is the
[39:19] time we can't fix what already
[39:24] happened and there's no need to worry
[39:26] about the
[39:29] future we need Grace for
[39:33] today and number three is that you know
[39:35] God deals in
[39:40] dreams now I'm not a
[39:43] dreamer and so other people have dreams
[39:46] and they tell
[39:49] me and so a friend of mine had a dream
[39:52] uh in the last few
[39:55] months
[39:57] and he related it to
[39:59] me and he said he was in uh well he he
[40:03] the scene was brother bram's living
[40:08] room and he was like a fly on the
[40:12] wall and so in the dream he could see
[40:15] sister
[40:16] [Music]
[40:18] brandom and he could see brother
[40:21] Neville and they were sitting in the
[40:23] living room
[40:25] talking
[40:27] and then uh Rebecca and I were sitting
[40:29] by the
[40:33] fireplace and so the the conversation
[40:36] went
[40:39] on and so then brother nille got up to
[40:44] leave and then sister brandham went over
[40:47] to the door to say
[40:51] goodbye and so they're they're talking
[40:53] there by the
[40:55] door
[40:57] and they said to Rebecca come over
[41:00] here so I'm still sitting by the
[41:04] fireplace and they three standing by the
[41:08] door and they said to
[41:11] me keep doing what you're
[41:15] doing that's why I'm here
[41:17] tonight I I could be a lot of
[41:22] places for the first time in my life I
[41:24] took a vacation this year
[41:28] I went to
[41:30] Europe where nobody knew who I
[41:33] was we had a good
[41:35] time so I'm not an
[41:39] Entertainer I'm only here to give a
[41:41] witness to a great
[41:46] message now from our scripture we didn't
[41:48] see anything about an
[41:54] attorney Jesus Christ is the only
[41:56] righteous
[41:59] one he is our
[42:02] attorney and it doesn't say anything
[42:04] about a
[42:06] judge because as much as I love you but
[42:09] nobody
[42:12] qualifies now you know when you're
[42:14] walking through the
[42:16] airport and people have this little
[42:18] thing in their
[42:20] ear and they're just
[42:23] talking and there's nobody
[42:25] around
[42:27] so I can only hear half of the
[42:30] conversation and then I can judge the
[42:33] case based on half of the
[42:36] information we do
[42:38] that but we need to uh be a little more
[42:45] careful and so we're only here as a
[42:49] witness we trust that somebody can learn
[42:52] something from what I'm going to tell
[42:55] you
[42:56] I'm the eagle that was born in the
[42:58] Baptist chicken
[43:02] yard we trust that God can bless
[43:06] you and see that it was God leading you
[43:08] from whatever chicken yard into the
[43:10] church
[43:17] tonight because see we're
[43:20] Overcomers and as Overcomers there's
[43:22] things
[43:25] overcome
[43:27] and so we must find balance in our
[43:29] Christian
[43:32] walk it's just like in what you eat how
[43:35] you take care of your animals it's all
[43:36] about
[43:41] balance now in our world today there's
[43:43] over 6,000 known
[43:49] languages and some languages still don't
[43:52] have any Scripture or any writing even
[43:54] in their language
[44:00] now only 487 years
[44:05] ago a
[44:07] man a man by the name of William
[44:12] tendale William T he was his interest
[44:16] was to get the scripture into
[44:22] English but it was illegal he was burned
[44:25] for that purpose
[44:29] so today we have the English Bible every
[44:34] house but the scripture has come at
[44:36] Great
[44:40] cost now in
[44:43] 1944 my parents graduated from Bible
[44:47] College in
[44:51] californiafor my mother was from Tucson
[44:54] Arizona mother
[44:56] and my dad was from Kansas City
[44:58] Missouri Kansas City Missouri and so as
[45:01] soon as they graduated they H felt a
[45:03] burden to go into Mexico and find this
[45:06] tribe and translate the
[45:15] scriptures because just like I said
[45:17] there's all these languages but there's
[45:19] not even any writing in some
[45:24] languages
[45:26] we live in the 21st century it's hard to
[45:30] believe but everybody doesn't have a
[45:32] cell phone on the
[45:35] planet some people do not have a written
[45:38] language
[45:42] yet so my parents moved up into the
[45:45] mountains of
[45:49] Chihuahua now there wasn't a highway
[45:51] like there is
[45:54] today they drove as far as they
[45:59] could and then they had to uh hire
[46:05] animals to take them four days into the
[46:10] mountains now here's two white people
[46:13] that don't even know
[46:17] Spanish and Newly Weds and they're up
[46:19] here in the
[46:21] mountains and they're looking for this
[46:24] tribe
[46:26] and when you find them then you have to
[46:28] be a friend to
[46:33] them and and you have to start making a
[46:39] dictionary because they have a different
[46:42] word for everything you're going to
[46:43] point
[46:46] to that takes a long
[46:49] time so uh as happens in newly Read's
[46:54] homes
[46:58] eventually there's going to be a baby
[47:02] born and so they came out of the
[47:06] mountains and instead of coming up to
[47:08] Arizona where grandma
[47:11] lived they they went down to Mexico City
[47:14] where the where the headquarters
[47:19] was and that's where their first child
[47:21] was born in late August
[47:24] 1945
[47:27] that was
[47:30] me now eventually I became the first of
[47:33] 10
[47:37] children there was five boys and five
[47:41] girls now today two of the girls are
[47:45] already uh in
[47:50] heaven but next
[47:53] weekend the eight of us are going to to
[47:55] get together in
[47:58] Flagstaff that only happens every 10
[48:01] years or
[48:03] so so we're looking forward to
[48:08] that and back to our
[48:11] story so to do this work of trans of
[48:14] making a dictionary and then
[48:20] Translating that can take up to 20
[48:24] years
[48:26] and my dad didn't have that kind of
[48:29] patience so he moved the family over to
[48:32] the East Coast of
[48:36] Mexico and that's where he established a
[48:39] bible
[48:43] school and it's still there
[48:47] today and that's where I began in the
[48:49] first
[48:52] grade so all the first uh all all
[48:55] Elementary years the six years I took in
[49:02] Spanish all the numbers in my head are
[49:05] all in
[49:07] Spanish now my mother had a big job
[49:09] because she's raising these
[49:13] children and so she one of her rules was
[49:16] now in the house you speak English
[49:18] outside you speak
[49:23] Spanish now that was just one of her
[49:25] rules
[49:28] but it was very handy years
[49:32] later so being the only American in this
[49:37] school and so I don't know what the
[49:39] parents told the kids at
[49:43] home but one day when I wasn't paying
[49:48] attention this little friend of mine got
[49:50] a very sharp point on his
[49:54] pencil
[49:56] now we didn't have pencil
[49:59] sharpeners everybody had a single Ed
[50:02] razor
[50:03] blade and today they put you in jail for
[50:08] that but anyway he got a very sharp P
[50:13] point and uh when I wasn't watching he
[50:15] stabbed me in the
[50:19] arm and when he saw that I had red blood
[50:21] like his we could be
[50:24] friends
[50:29] so that was my first battle
[50:32] scar so anyway being the missionary's
[50:35] child I was always on the front row at
[50:37] least three times a
[50:45] week and so uh eventually by the time I
[50:48] was 9 years old I realized that the
[50:50] gospel wasn't just for all these people
[50:52] back here it's for me
[50:54] too
[51:00] because the scripture says all have
[51:05] sinned that's all the Brams and the
[51:08] Smiths oronas all of
[51:11] themth all have
[51:14] sinned and they come short of the glory
[51:16] of
[51:17] God but who whoever shall call upon the
[51:20] name of the Lord shall be
[51:23] saved so I received Lord as my
[51:28] savior and I was baptized on Easter
[51:33] Sunday and that was in the Baptist
[51:35] Church in
[51:37] Mexico INX now just be patient we're
[51:40] going to get to the good part here in a
[51:41] little
[51:44] bit so by 1958 I was turning 13 and my
[51:48] parents decided I need to go to American
[51:54] School
[51:59] and so from 7th to 12th I was in English
[52:07] schools and we moved you know they moved
[52:10] us several
[52:12] times but in January of
[52:17] 1962 I was a
[52:20] teenager and I had a closer encounter
[52:23] with the Lord
[52:24] Jesus
[52:26] and then I moved to Tucson halfway
[52:28] through the 10th
[52:32] grade and I lived with my
[52:35] grandfather and I was in mine high
[52:40] school high school and I was the kid
[52:43] with the um with the
[52:49] reputation because I didn't go to the
[52:51] dances and I didn't drink and I didn't
[52:54] smoke
[52:56] and so I was kind of like the Oddball
[52:58] you
[53:00] know and um then in 1963 my family moved
[53:04] to
[53:08] Tucson and turns out that one day A
[53:11] friend of mine in
[53:15] school she uh said now we know that
[53:18] you're very very
[53:21] picky but we know just the girl for you
[53:27] and so I said well fine where is
[53:30] she well she's way over there getting on
[53:32] the
[53:35] bus and so the next day she introduced
[53:37] me to Rebecca
[53:40] brandham Rebecca Bram and sure enough
[53:43] the most beautiful girl on the
[53:48] planet and she said now my dad's a
[53:52] preacher and you have to meet him
[53:55] well they didn't scare me because I knew
[53:57] a lot of
[54:01] preachers and so that day after school I
[54:04] went to their house and met her
[54:09] dad now they only lived a block and a
[54:12] half from my
[54:15] house and um so she introduced me to him
[54:19] in the
[54:21] backyard and he didn't have a shirt on
[54:26] he he was working with the
[54:28] plants and I wasn't
[54:31] offended but I never heard this name
[54:36] before see I was in the Baptist
[54:40] Church now we knew why we were right and
[54:42] we knew why everybody else was
[54:48] wrong that spirit's still around you
[54:53] know and so at at that time I had a used
[54:56] Ford
[55:00] pickup and U but it was clean you
[55:03] know and her big brother had a brand new
[55:06] red
[55:10] Chevrolet but I thought this is going to
[55:12] be a
[55:15] problem but he was a skinny kid like me
[55:17] so it didn't
[55:21] matter but her dad drove a
[55:24] fort have on for and so we're talking in
[55:26] the backyard a little
[55:30] bit and I don't know what he
[55:33] said but I was there for a
[55:37] reason I wanted to get closer to his
[55:41] daughter now at that point i' had
[55:43] already read my Bible all the way
[55:47] through
[55:49] and I didn't know what this conversation
[55:52] was really all about but he was very
[55:54] nice
[55:59] but later I
[56:01] realized that during this
[56:04] conversation he was scanning the hard
[56:10] drive and he could see the whole
[56:13] picture I didn't know
[56:15] that but when we finished talking I had
[56:18] the
[56:21] Victory and he had the
[56:23] problem
[56:25] because there were some other guys
[56:28] waiting but they knew who he
[56:31] was and they were scared of
[56:34] him but I didn't know who he
[56:37] was all things work
[56:41] together so now when they moved to
[56:45] Arizona they just brought their clothes
[56:48] they didn't know how long they were
[56:48] going to
[56:52] stay at that point Rebecca was halfway
[56:54] through the 11th
[57:00] grade and over in Jeffersonville they
[57:03] they had a relatively normal
[57:09] lifeon they you know had the church they
[57:11] had the
[57:13] school and the piano teacher lived
[57:15] across the
[57:18] road and every day Rebecca came home she
[57:21] would practice the
[57:23] piano
[57:27] but in Arizona there's no
[57:30] church and a new
[57:32] school and no
[57:34] piano and no
[57:37] trees and so teenager gets
[57:42] nervous and she found out that the girl
[57:44] in the corner had a grand
[57:50] piano and because her mother was a piano
[57:53] teacher
[57:55] and so one day brother random is getting
[57:57] the family ready to go to
[58:02] supper and he looks in the back and
[58:04] there's only two
[58:07] children he says no wait a minute
[58:08] there's one missing where's
[58:11] Rebecca and uh the mother says well
[58:14] she's at the corner we'll pick her up on
[58:15] the
[58:19] way so when brother random stops the car
[58:21] on the
[58:23] corner and he goes up to the door to
[58:26] knock on the
[58:29] door he hears the piano
[58:33] playing but it wasn't down at the
[58:38] cross and it wasn't bethoven
[58:41] it was rock and roll rock and roll and
[58:44] there was two girls on one
[58:47] piano so it's a miracle that they even
[58:50] heard him knock on the
[58:53] door
[58:56] and you know his heart is breaking my my
[58:57] my girl you know
[59:03] piano and so then when she comes to the
[59:06] door he didn't jerk his belt
[59:10] off he said it's time to
[59:14] go and so they
[59:16] left and she didn't hear another word
[59:19] about that for two
[59:22] months that when brother tells the story
[59:25] in August of
[59:30] 64 it it sounds pretty serious about the
[59:36] piano but he said then she met George
[59:38] and he's a Christian and it's the end of
[59:40] the
[59:47] problem so what was the
[59:49] solution I was taking her to the Baptist
[59:52] church every
[59:53] Sunday
[59:55] and he was very happy about
[59:57] it and sometimes he went with
[1:00:00] us so you go where you can be
[1:00:05] fed and so in early June of 63 was the
[1:00:09] first time I was in a meeting where he
[1:00:10] was
[1:00:17] preaching now we had we had visited at
[1:00:19] the
[1:00:22] house and uh everything he said in in
[1:00:25] everything in this service is all
[1:00:30] scriptural so people ask me well what
[1:00:32] attracted you to this
[1:00:36] message well the young lady was de bait
[1:00:38] on the hook you
[1:00:43] know but you see I had already read my
[1:00:48] Bible and so talking to
[1:00:51] him here's a man that is living the
[1:00:54] Spirit of the
[1:00:59] scripture the other people I knew they
[1:01:01] had learned the the
[1:01:07] scripture but he was he was living the
[1:01:09] spirit of the
[1:01:12] scripture and so then people asked
[1:01:14] brother R how can I get closer to
[1:01:19] God every day you read your Bible and
[1:01:22] you
[1:01:23] pray
[1:01:25] but see we got too many people that are
[1:01:27] like non back in the Old
[1:01:31] Testament yeah we already knew
[1:01:33] that but just do the simple
[1:01:37] things I mean here's William brandom he
[1:01:40] knew who he
[1:01:43] was but yet he stands in the Pulpit on
[1:01:46] all these tapes and he's he's telling
[1:01:48] the very simple Bible
[1:01:53] stories
[1:01:55] and one place here in Phoenix he said
[1:01:57] one
[1:01:59] day he said The Minister's
[1:02:03] job is to make Christ real to the
[1:02:08] people so I would just like to give you
[1:02:10] a little glimpse into what I call the
[1:02:12] prophetic
[1:02:16] Dimension and that is that prophets
[1:02:18] speak from
[1:02:22] eternity with prophets it's always
[1:02:24] present
[1:02:26] tense and sometimes it's hard to
[1:02:28] distinguish between actual time and the
[1:02:31] prophetic
[1:02:36] realm just like just like Elisha with
[1:02:39] the
[1:02:41] Assyrians so Elisha was in the house
[1:02:43] with his
[1:02:46] helper and he said now go look outside
[1:02:48] see what's
[1:02:51] happening so he comes back trembling
[1:02:55] because all he could see was was
[1:02:57] Soldiers with with
[1:03:00] swords and they were looking for
[1:03:03] Elisha now Elisha didn't get mad and
[1:03:05] slap
[1:03:08] him he just put his hand on the young
[1:03:11] man said God open the young man's
[1:03:15] eyes so then he went out and looked
[1:03:19] again there's all the same
[1:03:22] soldiers but on the hillsides there's
[1:03:24] Angels
[1:03:26] everywhere I see that's the prophetic
[1:03:30] Dimension so in 1950 brother ran was
[1:03:33] preaching in Houston Texas 10
[1:03:39] nights and during this time there was
[1:03:42] many people being
[1:03:46] healed and they were in an auditorium
[1:03:48] that held about 6,000
[1:03:52] people there was a Baptist man that
[1:03:54] thought it was his job to prove it was
[1:03:56] all
[1:04:00] wrong and so it was in the
[1:04:04] newspapers and brother Bosworth was
[1:04:06] helping brother
[1:04:09] brandham and he said now brother Brandon
[1:04:11] we got to do something this man's making
[1:04:12] our life
[1:04:18] impossible he wants a
[1:04:20] debate and brother RM said we're not
[1:04:21] going to waste one night with this guy
[1:04:23] when we got hundreds of people need to
[1:04:24] be prayed
[1:04:29] for but brother Bosworth convinced him
[1:04:32] that it could be done very
[1:04:37] nicely so then when the word got out
[1:04:39] that there's going to be a
[1:04:43] debate they had to move the meeting from
[1:04:46] the 6000 to a bigger place to held
[1:04:53] 30,000
[1:04:55] and so they're going to have this
[1:04:58] debate and brother Ram said I'm not
[1:05:00] going to go I'll sit at the hotel I'll
[1:05:02] be back tomorrow
[1:05:07] night but the holy spirit said no you
[1:05:09] have to go to church
[1:05:13] tonight and so he comes to church with
[1:05:16] it's him and his
[1:05:19] wife and his
[1:05:21] brother and little Rebecca four years
[1:05:26] old and so he's he says he camouflaged
[1:05:29] himself disguised himself somehow and he
[1:05:31] came in nobody knew he was
[1:05:35] there so he's way up in the
[1:05:40] balcony and for the first time Rebecca
[1:05:42] is sitting with her dad in
[1:05:48] church because she could see the other
[1:05:50] little girls sitting with their
[1:05:53] dads
[1:05:55] but her dad was always up
[1:05:58] here and so she's very
[1:06:02] proud and they're watching the the uh
[1:06:06] activity on the
[1:06:09] pulpit and so brother Bosworth said now
[1:06:11] I have one question for the Baptist
[1:06:17] pastor bsta now in the Old Testament we
[1:06:20] have seven compound names of of of um
[1:06:28] Jehovah and he said now can we take
[1:06:30] these seven compound names of redemption
[1:06:32] and place apply them to Jesus Christ yes
[1:06:35] or
[1:06:40] no well now the Baptist had to think
[1:06:43] about
[1:06:45] it because if he says
[1:06:48] yes then that includes Divine
[1:06:51] Healing but if he says no then there's
[1:06:53] there's no
[1:06:56] salvation and so they had a bit of a
[1:07:01] debate you can hear about it on
[1:07:05] tape so finally brother bosor says now I
[1:07:08] think brother brandom's in the audience
[1:07:10] if he is here he can come down and
[1:07:12] dismiss the
[1:07:18] audience and so he starts to get
[1:07:22] up
[1:07:24] and his brother said don't get up we'll
[1:07:25] have a riot
[1:07:30] here but the the wife says it's okay he
[1:07:33] knows what he's
[1:07:36] doing and so he gets up and he puts
[1:07:38] Rebecca in his seat so she could see all
[1:07:40] the way
[1:07:46] down so he comes down through the
[1:07:48] audience down to the
[1:07:52] pulpit
[1:07:54] now the Baptist preacher had hired some
[1:07:56] professional
[1:08:03] photographers and they were taking
[1:08:07] pictures and so when brother Ram comes
[1:08:10] down to the
[1:08:13] platform he um said a few
[1:08:16] words and he said I don't need to say
[1:08:18] anymore he's
[1:08:22] present and that's when this picture
[1:08:24] over here was
[1:08:28] taken and when they went to develop the
[1:08:33] film and that was the only picture that
[1:08:35] came out everything else was
[1:08:39] blank and regarding the picture brother
[1:08:42] Bram says it's better if you have the
[1:08:43] photograph than if the than if the light
[1:08:45] came in the in the audience
[1:08:52] here because your eyes could fool
[1:08:56] you and in another place he says that he
[1:09:00] um he was he had a prayer line
[1:09:04] coming in anyway this lady comes in the
[1:09:06] prayer
[1:09:09] line and she's holding one of these
[1:09:11] pictures that she had bought out
[1:09:15] front and he says now let's talk about
[1:09:17] that
[1:09:20] picture and um he said now on my desk at
[1:09:23] home I have a
[1:09:27] testimony and the testimony is that this
[1:09:31] lady was laying in the hospital
[1:09:36] dying and she had the picture on the
[1:09:39] stand beside the
[1:09:43] bed and she said that as she was
[1:09:47] praying she saw the light come off the
[1:09:49] picture and hang over
[1:09:52] her
[1:09:56] and she was healed and went
[1:09:58] home and we've had many testimonies
[1:10:00] since then very
[1:10:04] similar but you know while brother Brown
[1:10:06] was coming down through the
[1:10:09] audience I see there's less than 200
[1:10:12] people here
[1:10:14] today but if you have
[1:10:17] 30,000 brother Bram said there was cases
[1:10:20] there that were very
[1:10:22] serious
[1:10:24] he said it make the heart of an Iron Man
[1:10:30] melt and he said but there was 500
[1:10:33] ushers helped me get down
[1:10:37] here so years later when Rebecca's
[1:10:40] hearing the tape like we
[1:10:44] do she asked her mother wait a minute
[1:10:47] did you did you see 500
[1:10:51] ushers and the mother said no dear those
[1:10:54] weren't
[1:10:56] ushers those were
[1:10:59] Angels so they're very
[1:11:02] real and there's many other things that
[1:11:04] we could tell you about you know as far
[1:11:06] as the uh prophetic
[1:11:11] Dimension at the end of 1963 brother
[1:11:13] brandom went back to Jefferson B to
[1:11:15] preach at Christmas
[1:11:22] time now all you young guys know how it
[1:11:24] is when your girlfriend goes away for
[1:11:25] two weeks it seems like it's a
[1:11:31] year and so they're far away I'm in
[1:11:37] Tucson so I got a ride with some other
[1:11:41] people and surprised them on December
[1:11:49] 29th so I'm in the church for the first
[1:11:52] time
[1:11:55] and it's it's very new and everything's
[1:11:59] different so between the services we
[1:12:02] went to
[1:12:06] lunch my brother R knew that that I was
[1:12:08] in school with
[1:12:12] Rebecca and he knew that I was the
[1:12:14] assistant choir director at the Baptist
[1:12:19] Church and so he said now George this
[1:12:22] evening in the service I want you to
[1:12:28] sing see that was a long time
[1:12:31] ago and I've got a bit of a head cult so
[1:12:34] we're not going to sing
[1:12:38] tonight but anyway I said want me to
[1:12:41] sing at the brandom
[1:12:45] Tabernacle and I said yeah he said uh
[1:12:48] and he said in fact tonight we're going
[1:12:49] to have a a prayer
[1:12:52] line
[1:12:55] and I said well what would I sing
[1:12:58] here he said it'd be nice if you could
[1:13:00] sing then Jesus
[1:13:05] came I never heard
[1:13:08] it but I learned
[1:13:10] it and so sang it that
[1:13:13] night and he was very
[1:13:16] proud for the first time his daughter is
[1:13:19] playing in
[1:13:21] church and he came out and preached Look
[1:13:24] Away to
[1:13:28] Jesus okay so moving forward in
[1:13:34] 1964 uh Rebecca and I graduated together
[1:13:37] from High
[1:13:40] School and brother brand said finally a
[1:13:43] brandham I was
[1:13:47] graduated he was very
[1:13:49] happy and uh then in July he was was
[1:13:53] preaching in
[1:13:57] Philadelphia and when you went to church
[1:14:00] with brother bradam in the
[1:14:05] car um he would get there in time to
[1:14:07] step in the
[1:14:10] Pulpit now this is Rebecca's story I
[1:14:13] wasn't
[1:14:15] there and so they got to the
[1:14:18] service and all the seats were
[1:14:22] taken
[1:14:24] and so Rebecca and her friend Betty they
[1:14:26] found him a seat up in the mezzan a
[1:14:27] little higher they could
[1:14:34] see and so when brother R came in it was
[1:14:37] was a long table behind the
[1:14:42] pulpit and his seat was right beside the
[1:14:47] pulpit and brother Roberts was speaking
[1:14:51] first and so while brother r sitting
[1:14:53] there uh and brother Roberts is
[1:14:59] speaking brother Brandon reached out
[1:15:01] reaches over and feels his
[1:15:05] coat and so then he it's his turn to
[1:15:08] preach and he he noticed that his it
[1:15:11] didn't even match his coat didn't match
[1:15:12] his
[1:15:17] pants and it was a great
[1:15:20] service but then when they're leaving
[1:15:22] and going back to the hotel
[1:15:26] Rebecca said I saw what you
[1:15:30] did he says yeah that was a fine fine
[1:15:33] suit he had
[1:15:37] on and and mine didn't even
[1:15:41] match so brother BR probably paid you
[1:15:44] know $49.95 for his
[1:15:49] outfit but brother brother Robert suit
[1:15:52] probably cost $1,000
[1:15:57] but here's here's two anointed
[1:16:00] men but some things just didn't
[1:16:04] matter brother Brandon was preaching the
[1:16:08] word the little stuff like clothes
[1:16:11] didn't matter so
[1:16:14] much okay so we have to tell you a
[1:16:16] little bit about the
[1:16:20] courtship we couldn't have any dates
[1:16:21] during the week cuz we were in school
[1:16:27] Sunday we had
[1:16:29] church and so we was you know we had to
[1:16:32] be
[1:16:33] careful now we only lived a block and a
[1:16:36] half
[1:16:39] apart but we were just like the kids
[1:16:44] today we we like to talk on the
[1:16:48] phone but we didn't have these little
[1:16:52] guys and brother brandom didn't live in
[1:16:54] a gated
[1:16:58] community he you know you could drive
[1:17:00] right up to his
[1:17:02] house so in my house there was you know
[1:17:05] a lot of
[1:17:08] activity we had a black phone on the
[1:17:11] wall with the ringer you know
[1:17:16] dial and my dad had some
[1:17:20] rules he always said yeah we have a
[1:17:22] democracy my
[1:17:25] house said I have the
[1:17:30] vote yeah it sounds like Mexico doesn't
[1:17:33] it and so I had to you really gauge my
[1:17:37] time when I could talk on the
[1:17:41] phone and at Rebecca's house uh they had
[1:17:45] uh a phone but by then they had the push
[1:17:47] button
[1:17:52] phone
[1:17:54] but it was still hooked to the
[1:17:56] wall had a
[1:18:00] cord but brother random got tired of
[1:18:02] people
[1:18:05] calling so he's looking at the
[1:18:08] phone so on the back of it there was a
[1:18:10] wheel you could
[1:18:13] turn if you turned it one way the ringer
[1:18:16] got
[1:18:21] louder and if you turn it the other way
[1:18:23] the ringer went
[1:18:26] off so he turned it
[1:18:29] off so Rebecca said what are we going to
[1:18:33] do it's very
[1:18:35] simple he set your watch just like
[1:18:41] mine okay now when it's 7 o' I'm going
[1:18:44] to call
[1:18:47] you now thanks to your dad this doesn't
[1:18:51] ring
[1:18:53] but I'll be
[1:18:54] there so 7:00 she picks up the phone and
[1:18:57] there it
[1:19:00] was and it had a long
[1:19:03] cord so she would go in the closet and
[1:19:05] shut the door and I had we had
[1:19:10] privacy you see love conquers
[1:19:14] all well um brother bam had a
[1:19:20] Cadillac and back then Cadillac was like
[1:19:23] a Mercedes today it was very
[1:19:30] nice now he didn't go buy the Cadillac
[1:19:33] somebody gave it to
[1:19:36] him and by the time I knew him it was
[1:19:38] already almost 10 years
[1:19:42] old but it was a big
[1:19:46] car and had a V8
[1:19:50] engine and it had two four barrel car
[1:19:56] and it had air
[1:19:57] [Music]
[1:19:59] conditioning it's hot in
[1:20:01] Arizona and so he would let me use his
[1:20:04] car
[1:20:06] sometimes but you see his car took the
[1:20:09] expensive
[1:20:13] gas that means that we had to pay this
[1:20:16] guy 36 C a gallon to build the
[1:20:21] tank but we only bought $3 at a
[1:20:27] time and um so anyway that's um story
[1:20:31] about the car but you know we would we
[1:20:34] would go to the Baptist
[1:20:38] church and we were in my
[1:20:41] pickup and so I'm driving and then
[1:20:43] there's Rebecca and then my
[1:20:47] sister and back then we didn't have
[1:20:49] four-door pickups it was very
[1:20:51] simple
[1:20:54] and my brother and sisters are sitting
[1:20:55] in the
[1:20:58] back and so sometimes brother and would
[1:21:00] come out to tell us
[1:21:05] goodbye and he would say my what a fine
[1:21:07] load of young preachers you have
[1:21:12] here I didn't see any
[1:21:14] preachers I saw little
[1:21:17] brothers but guess what they're all
[1:21:20] preachers
[1:21:21] today we're all going to be together
[1:21:23] next
[1:21:25] week so there's a lot of other little
[1:21:28] things here and there but you know God
[1:21:30] knows what he's
[1:21:33] doing and you you learn as you go
[1:21:37] along and at the end of 1964 God says to
[1:21:40] brother Ram now you're going to be
[1:21:41] staying here so look for a
[1:21:48] house so he starts
[1:21:51] looking he looked in Phoenix Pho he
[1:21:54] looked in
[1:21:55] Tucson and he found the house that he
[1:21:57] liked down
[1:21:59] there and so he said the Holy Ghost led
[1:22:02] him to the
[1:22:04] place and that's where he built the den
[1:22:08] room and uh so all that uh year of 65
[1:22:12] he's he's building on that
[1:22:18] house and so in in May of 65 uh I was
[1:22:22] out of school for a
[1:22:28] year and so I didn't have a
[1:22:31] job didn't have any
[1:22:34] training I didn't have a car
[1:22:37] yet and um didn't have the Holy
[1:22:41] Ghost I wasn't baptized
[1:22:44] right but I thought I needed a
[1:22:50] wife so I go to talk to the
[1:22:54] man and um and so I go to talk to him
[1:23:00] and he starts telling me all these
[1:23:01] stories about places he's
[1:23:08] been and after a long time I said to
[1:23:10] brother B this is all very interesting
[1:23:12] but I'm here for a
[1:23:19] purpose and and what would that be
[1:23:21] sir
[1:23:23] well um you must noticed that I really
[1:23:26] like your
[1:23:30] daughter and I said I'm here to ask for
[1:23:33] your permission and your blessing to
[1:23:34] marry
[1:23:38] her and then his eyes got very
[1:23:43] narrow I mean this is his
[1:23:47] firstborn and he says now look I'm going
[1:23:49] to give you permission to be engaged
[1:23:55] but don't even think about
[1:23:58] marriage until you both have the baptism
[1:24:00] of Holy
[1:24:03] Ghost and that's good for today
[1:24:07] also and so a smart person would have
[1:24:10] said okay uh I'm going to kneel down
[1:24:12] here no that wasn't
[1:24:19] me I said Thank you and that was over
[1:24:23] so again they took off for a couple of
[1:24:25] months to uh
[1:24:30] Jeffersonville and I don't know how I
[1:24:32] got there but I went back for two
[1:24:37] weeks and I was there when he preached
[1:24:39] like the nor ones at the end
[1:24:43] time what's the attraction on the
[1:24:46] mountain and so he preached on August
[1:24:49] the
[1:24:50] 1st and I knew that he was going to be
[1:24:52] driving to Tucson during that next
[1:24:57] week and I already had a a seat in the
[1:25:03] car but I said now before we go to
[1:25:05] Arizona will there be time for you to
[1:25:07] baptize me
[1:25:13] correctly well he was very happy because
[1:25:15] he'd been waiting three years for
[1:25:20] that waiting for the light to come on
[1:25:22] you
[1:25:24] know so on Monday afternoon August
[1:25:29] 2nd he um took me down to the church and
[1:25:32] baptized
[1:25:34] me and as it turned out that's the last
[1:25:36] person he
[1:25:40] baptized so then we go to
[1:25:43] Arizona this is in August of
[1:25:48] 65 and by then I I had the the girl
[1:25:50] under contract
[1:25:56] and I had the
[1:25:57] baptism and I had a
[1:25:59] car so making
[1:26:02] progress so he's riding in the car with
[1:26:05] me I'm
[1:26:08] driving and out of nowhere he says now
[1:26:11] George if you ever get to go to Israel
[1:26:14] your Bible will become a new
[1:26:21] book
[1:26:23] now first of all he never went to
[1:26:27] Israel and I wasn't thinking about
[1:26:30] Israel I was thinking about the
[1:26:34] girl and um but you know prophets look
[1:26:37] into the
[1:26:40] future and those that have been over
[1:26:43] there with me know that it's true your
[1:26:44] Bible becomes a new
[1:26:51] book and so from when he said that in '
[1:26:57] 65 then we made our first trip in
[1:27:04] 73 and this past June was trip number
[1:27:11] 48 and maybe we'll never go back I don't
[1:27:15] know but you had your
[1:27:19] chance so um so that was August and then
[1:27:22] in September uh brother Ram was
[1:27:24] preaching up here in
[1:27:28] Phoenix and so we drove up here
[1:27:32] phoen and I let Rebecca out at the door
[1:27:34] and I went to park the
[1:27:38] car and you know how girls are when
[1:27:40] they're engaged somehow that left hand
[1:27:42] is
[1:27:49] always so she and so she comes in into
[1:27:52] the into this big
[1:27:55] hotel and so there's her friend Sharon
[1:27:58] waiting for
[1:27:59] her and so Sharon saw the
[1:28:03] ring and and she says
[1:28:08] Rebecca are you are you
[1:28:12] serious is it that Baptist
[1:28:15] guy yeah but daddy likes
[1:28:20] him so that was the of the
[1:28:24] discussion but we've been friends ever
[1:28:28] since but you know um in September is
[1:28:32] when brother Ram had the encounter up in
[1:28:34] subo
[1:28:38] canyon and I remember seeing him that
[1:28:40] day that he came back from Sabino
[1:28:45] Canyon he was a very happy person very
[1:28:50] different now at that time brother perig
[1:28:54] green was in town from
[1:28:59] Texas because his mother was a
[1:29:01] seamstress she made
[1:29:05] curtains and they had made the curtains
[1:29:07] for the new house in Tucson and brother
[1:29:09] Perry was there to install the
[1:29:14] curtains and so I didn't know but
[1:29:17] brother brandom said to brother green
[1:29:18] one day he said now look it looks like
[1:29:20] this kid's going to be my son-in-law
[1:29:21] would you please take him home pray for
[1:29:23] the Holy
[1:29:35] Ghost so he invited me to
[1:29:39] Texas now some of you probably remember
[1:29:41] brother the
[1:29:44] green and he made things bigger than
[1:29:47] they really
[1:29:50] were
[1:29:52] I thought I thought I was on
[1:29:54] vacation but he lived in a very small
[1:29:57] little
[1:29:58] house and my room didn't have an air
[1:30:02] conditioner but anyway I'm over there in
[1:30:06] Texas and uh the next day he had a
[1:30:09] brother from Louisiana came over to use
[1:30:11] his
[1:30:15] phone to call brother
[1:30:18] brandham so when they called brother
[1:30:20] Bram was already out of the house
[1:30:25] but they said Your name's on the list
[1:30:26] when he comes back we'll have him call
[1:30:31] you so there's the two brothers waiting
[1:30:34] for this phone
[1:30:37] call and I'm over in my
[1:30:40] room but somehow I felt inspired okay
[1:30:43] they're dope there's two preachers maybe
[1:30:45] we should
[1:30:50] pray and so we go over there and we're
[1:30:52] kneeling down at the bench
[1:30:56] praying and while we're praying in my
[1:30:59] mind I can see uh like a cloudy sky but
[1:31:02] there's breaks where the sun comes
[1:31:04] through like in
[1:31:14] pencil and so all of a sudden the phone
[1:31:18] rings and brother green goes to answer
[1:31:20] his phone
[1:31:23] so it was brother brandom calling for
[1:31:25] the other
[1:31:28] brother but he said before I talk to him
[1:31:30] let me talk to
[1:31:34] George so I greeted
[1:31:37] him and uh he said now George let me be
[1:31:40] the first to congratulate you on
[1:31:42] receiving the baptism of the Holy
[1:31:48] Ghost because he knew I had a hard head
[1:31:53] and he wanted to identify what had just
[1:31:58] happened and so all these years
[1:32:02] later that that was very good that he
[1:32:05] told me
[1:32:06] that but God actually did something for
[1:32:10] me and I can be here tonight testifying
[1:32:13] about
[1:32:15] it so the next day I get a call from my
[1:32:18] mother also and two
[1:32:20] son
[1:32:23] and she said we have a letter here from
[1:32:25] President Johnson they need you in the
[1:32:30] Army you know the scripture says give to
[1:32:32] Caesar what
[1:32:36] Caesar's So within a week I was inducted
[1:32:39] into the US
[1:32:44] Army so I was a US Soldier with the Holy
[1:32:49] Ghost in November of 65 brother Brandon
[1:32:52] was preaching in streetport
[1:32:57] Louisiana and um he preached one of the
[1:33:00] sermons was God's only provided place of
[1:33:06] worship and so on Saturday morning I had
[1:33:08] a few minutes where I could talk to
[1:33:12] him I I had just finished basic
[1:33:17] training because see where I was
[1:33:19] stationing was only two hours from where
[1:33:20] he was preaching
[1:33:25] and so um I said now brother Ram I'm I'm
[1:33:28] a bit worried I don't know what they're
[1:33:30] going to do with me what I'm going to do
[1:33:31] in the
[1:33:38] Army he didn't even take a breath he
[1:33:41] said don't worry
[1:33:45] George the footsteps of the righteous
[1:33:47] are ordered of the
[1:33:50] Lord so he's quoting Psalm
[1:33:56] 37:23 and so when I went back to the
[1:34:00] army they made a cook out of
[1:34:04] me yeah for 500
[1:34:08] people well so then
[1:34:11] um we get to uh December of
[1:34:19] 65 and remember when they moved they
[1:34:21] didn't they didn't bring furniture they
[1:34:23] didn't bring a piano or
[1:34:28] anything and so one day brother Ram says
[1:34:31] to Rebecca now look I promised you a
[1:34:32] piano he said I've saved up $900 let's
[1:34:35] go down and look at
[1:34:43] pianos because he was interested in
[1:34:45] Furnishing the house and making it look
[1:34:50] nice
[1:34:53] and so they go down to the piano
[1:34:57] store and she knew kind of things what
[1:35:00] things were worth but he
[1:35:05] didn't and so he's wondering through the
[1:35:07] store looking at all the nice
[1:35:12] pianos and she's looking over here at
[1:35:14] the the Thousand
[1:35:18] pianos and so about then they open the
[1:35:20] big doors in the back now comes piano
[1:35:22] about like this one
[1:35:27] here they just restored
[1:35:30] it it was beautiful of course it caught
[1:35:34] his
[1:35:36] attention and so he says hey Rebecca
[1:35:38] come over look at this
[1:35:41] one well she knew it wasn't a th000
[1:35:46] piano no no Dad we don't
[1:35:48] want she didn't want to embarrass him
[1:35:52] well finally he gets her over
[1:35:55] there and so uh she comes over
[1:35:59] close and she sees it's a
[1:36:03] Steinway oh no dad no let's not get
[1:36:07] involved well just just play only
[1:36:09] believe let's see what it sounds
[1:36:13] like so while she's
[1:36:16] playing he's dealing with the
[1:36:20] salesman
[1:36:21] he says of course now he's almost taking
[1:36:24] the other position he say how much would
[1:36:26] you take for that piano right
[1:36:31] now and the guy says well we'll take
[1:36:36] $1,100 we'll take it he writes him a
[1:36:41] check he says I'll find the other
[1:36:45] $200 so they delivered the
[1:36:48] piano and that piano has been with us in
[1:36:50] all over our
[1:36:54] moves and in 1992 we thought you know we
[1:36:57] need to get this refinish because it's
[1:37:00] it's getting kind of
[1:37:06] ragged so we uh we called the
[1:37:10] store and uh Rebecca said you know we
[1:37:13] got this piano there and we want to see
[1:37:14] I get it
[1:37:19] restored he she said and the guy said
[1:37:22] fine what's what's the
[1:37:26] name so he looks up brandom we sold you
[1:37:30] a Steinway for
[1:37:38] $1,100 yes sir you see the check and
[1:37:40] I've got the
[1:37:43] piano and so he said now the man that
[1:37:46] restored that piano in' 65 he's still
[1:37:50] here
[1:37:54] because the piano was actually built in
[1:37:59] 1926 and so he's got time for one
[1:38:03] more so we'll come get
[1:38:05] it well anyway they finished it it
[1:38:07] looked
[1:38:10] beautiful and that refinish cost us
[1:38:16] $3,500 well we thought you know we might
[1:38:18] want to take insurance on this C thing
[1:38:20] uh
[1:38:24] so we had an estimate made on
[1:38:26] it so in
[1:38:30] 1992 it was worth
[1:38:33] 25,000 so you see God has ways of
[1:38:38] blessing but anyway um brother Brandon
[1:38:41] was anxious to get furniture in the
[1:38:42] house I helped him put some of the
[1:38:44] furniture
[1:38:48] together he never he never actually
[1:38:51] lived there but he got it all
[1:38:55] ready and so uh the idea was that they
[1:38:58] were going to go back to Jeffersonville
[1:39:00] he was going to preach pick up his new
[1:39:01] car and come
[1:39:08] back now he traded cars every two years
[1:39:11] because of high
[1:39:16] mileage now they were going to leave
[1:39:18] Rebecca in town so that she could move
[1:39:20] all the stuff out of the apartment into
[1:39:21] the new house and then they could come
[1:39:23] right to the new house when they come
[1:39:33] back and so they're going to leave very
[1:39:35] early on the 18th of
[1:39:41] December and brother Brown had some very
[1:39:45] uh
[1:39:46] specific ideas when he was
[1:39:50] traveling
[1:39:53] if he was traveling by himself or with
[1:39:55] Billy he would just wear blue jeans and
[1:39:57] you know some boots or
[1:40:03] something but if he traveled with the
[1:40:05] family he would dress up a little
[1:40:09] better and he liked to leave very
[1:40:13] early at six o'clock he's already
[1:40:17] moving it's okay if everybody goes to
[1:40:19] sleep but we got to get there
[1:40:24] and when he's packing his stuff the
[1:40:26] Bible was always the last thing in the
[1:40:32] suitcase because he didn't want anything
[1:40:34] on top of God's
[1:40:37] word and if you listen closely he says
[1:40:40] on tape not even my
[1:40:46] books and so he's going to leave very
[1:40:49] early so I wasn't going to get up you
[1:40:52] know the middle of the night I was going
[1:40:54] to go back say good night goodbye to him
[1:40:56] on the
[1:41:02] 17th so I go up on the night of the 17th
[1:41:05] of
[1:41:09] December and we're alone in his
[1:41:12] room and I noticed that by the door
[1:41:14] there's a chair with his boots and his
[1:41:16] blue
[1:41:19] jeans
[1:41:24] and I said what's this all
[1:41:27] about he said well Gody never knows when
[1:41:29] he might have car
[1:41:33] trouble but I knew that he never had
[1:41:35] problems with the
[1:41:37] car he kept his car in perfect
[1:41:41] condition that didn't say another
[1:41:44] word he didn't say another word but
[1:41:47] within 24 hours he'd been in a very bad
[1:41:49] head-on collision
[1:41:55] and so uh it would take another hour to
[1:41:57] explain that but it was um God's way of
[1:42:00] taking care of
[1:42:06] things I don't know if you've ever been
[1:42:08] over there to West Texas but it's very
[1:42:10] flat
[1:42:16] country see he knew something was coming
[1:42:19] up
[1:42:21] but he didn't know what it
[1:42:23] was and he had to stay in the in the
[1:42:27] lane he couldn't
[1:42:30] leave but anyway eventually after two
[1:42:33] days or so he's in the hospital in
[1:42:35] amarelo
[1:42:39] Texas all bandaged
[1:42:41] up and he had the the tracheotomy in his
[1:42:46] neck so he couldn't
[1:42:49] speak and I got got in to see him
[1:42:53] once but you know there was no cell
[1:42:57] phones there was a phone on the
[1:42:59] wall there's a lot of activity with the
[1:43:02] phone and there's all these people had
[1:43:04] come around to pray and Give opinions
[1:43:07] and
[1:43:11] things but you know there's one Mexican
[1:43:13] family sitting over
[1:43:16] there and nobody's talking to them so I
[1:43:19] went over and talked to them
[1:43:22] well it turns out they're the parents of
[1:43:24] one of the guys in the other
[1:43:29] car because see the other car that hit
[1:43:32] him head on there was four drunk
[1:43:37] guys one died at the
[1:43:40] scene and the other three were in the
[1:43:44] hospital and I just remember talking to
[1:43:46] them for a few
[1:43:48] minutes and their son was was one of the
[1:43:51] other
[1:43:53] three but it turns out that that that
[1:43:58] guy got better and eventually became a
[1:44:05] preacher and his grandson is now a
[1:44:07] preacher over in
[1:44:10] Texas and maybe I'll get to see him one
[1:44:13] day but these guys lived under This
[1:44:15] Cloud for all their life we helped kill
[1:44:18] William
[1:44:19] Brown
[1:44:25] but while brother brandom's in this ICU
[1:44:31] unit there's 12 beds in
[1:44:34] there and during those six days that
[1:44:36] he's
[1:44:39] there the other 11 beds got better and
[1:44:41] moved
[1:44:45] on but on the night of December
[1:44:49] 24
[1:44:52] God said that's
[1:44:54] enough and took him
[1:44:56] home now we were like the early
[1:45:01] disciples this isn't the way we planned
[1:45:05] it there's got what's going on
[1:45:08] here brother Ram says one
[1:45:11] place he says you're going to find out
[1:45:13] one of these
[1:45:15] days that when you go to
[1:45:18] heaven you don't fly off somewhere else
[1:45:22] you're still right
[1:45:24] here in a faster
[1:45:27] Dimension so they're only as far away as
[1:45:30] you put
[1:45:33] them now in the Catholic Church they're
[1:45:36] taught that we can we can have
[1:45:38] conversation but that's not
[1:45:43] true so as it turns out um they're going
[1:45:47] to they took the body to Jefferson to
[1:45:50] have the
[1:45:55] funeral so they had a funeral on
[1:45:57] December
[1:45:59] 29th I couldn't be there because there
[1:46:01] wasn't a blood relative I had to go back
[1:46:03] to the
[1:46:07] Army but sister Brandon was very injured
[1:46:09] and the wck she couldn't decide where
[1:46:11] the burial should
[1:46:18] be and Billy couldn't decide
[1:46:22] so there was no
[1:46:23] burial and the funeral director said I
[1:46:25] can keep him you let me know when you
[1:46:27] when you
[1:46:32] decide now you know the word says in
[1:46:34] second second
[1:46:36] Timothy God has not given us the spirit
[1:46:39] of
[1:46:42] fear power love and a sound
[1:46:48] mind and in Philippians phans Paul
[1:46:50] writes and the peace of God which passes
[1:46:53] all
[1:46:57] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[1:46:59] Minds through Christ
[1:47:03] Jesus now I was in the
[1:47:05] Army so I missed a lot of things were
[1:47:07] going
[1:47:09] on but you know we learned to pray we
[1:47:12] learned to listen to what he
[1:47:16] said and because see with God there's no
[1:47:19] surprises
[1:47:21] God got everything lined
[1:47:23] up so the missionary work began in
[1:47:27] Earnest and um things things were
[1:47:32] moving so by um March of 66 is three
[1:47:36] months
[1:47:40] later the family decided that the burial
[1:47:42] would be in
[1:47:47] Jeffersonville and so I in the Army in
[1:47:49] Louis
[1:47:53] and I knew what God had done for
[1:47:55] me and I knew what God had done for
[1:47:59] Rebeca so I called her one
[1:48:02] day I said hey let's get married next
[1:48:07] Tuesday so we were married on the 30th
[1:48:10] of March of
[1:48:14] 1966 right there in Tucson in a private
[1:48:18] ceremony and we took a go back to
[1:48:20] Indiana because there's going to be a
[1:48:25] burial so the burial was on April
[1:48:30] 11th and all through Billy Paul's life
[1:48:34] he always had a relationship with his
[1:48:40] grandmother but that was Hope's
[1:48:43] mother and but this woman was very
[1:48:46] difficult very
[1:48:48] hard he had never never seen her cry she
[1:48:51] never been to
[1:48:54] church but when he went to the burial he
[1:48:57] left his two little boys with
[1:49:01] grandmother and it was a rainy day and
[1:49:04] you know just kind of
[1:49:07] sad so then when he came back to pick up
[1:49:10] his
[1:49:13] boys the first time he sees Grandma
[1:49:15] wiping her
[1:49:19] eyes and she said you know even the
[1:49:21] heavens weep for that
[1:49:24] man and so later that day we left to go
[1:49:27] to
[1:49:31] californ and on April 15th of
[1:49:35] 66 I flew off to Vietnam for one
[1:49:40] year there was no phone no vacation only
[1:49:45] letters that was trial by
[1:49:48] fire but I knew knew that God had given
[1:49:51] me a
[1:49:53] spirit he kept me clean he ke me kept me
[1:49:57] balanced so after I came back and
[1:49:59] finished my two years in the
[1:50:05] military and so then I began with the
[1:50:07] translation work with the messages in
[1:50:12] Spanish the first track we translated
[1:50:15] was while he was still living he he said
[1:50:16] that's
[1:50:19] good
[1:50:22] and as you all know it's not so easy to
[1:50:24] take Kentucky English and put it into
[1:50:30] Spanish you almost have to put it in
[1:50:32] English
[1:50:37] first but we got to fast forward 40
[1:50:40] years we only got a few minutes
[1:50:43] left in October of of
[1:50:49] 06 Rebecca was very very
[1:50:53] sick there was much prayer much
[1:50:59] faith and she wasn't just anybody this
[1:51:02] this girl had spent 19 years with God's
[1:51:09] Prophet but she had um kidney
[1:51:13] cancer and then it went to the
[1:51:16] lungs and so it was difficult we were in
[1:51:18] a lot of hospitals and going through lot
[1:51:20] of
[1:51:23] stuff and I can see no matter what we
[1:51:25] did she was inching closer closer to
[1:51:33] going and I said now God can raise you
[1:51:35] up the next 10
[1:51:39] minutes but if he chooses to take
[1:51:42] you then you get with your dad and wait
[1:51:44] for me
[1:51:47] there and a few days later we had a a
[1:51:50] call from a sister back
[1:51:55] east and and she just she was a single
[1:51:58] sister and we knew her for a long
[1:52:02] time she said I was getting up from
[1:52:05] lunch today there in my
[1:52:09] house and right there was a
[1:52:13] vision and there was brother Brandon
[1:52:15] preaching to a lot of
[1:52:18] people and the prayer line was
[1:52:20] there and while he's
[1:52:23] preaching he says and you little sister
[1:52:26] thank you for praying for my daughter
[1:52:29] Rebecca and tell George not to worry
[1:52:31] everything's going to be
[1:52:34] okay so when you hear your name from the
[1:52:36] other dimension you pay
[1:52:41] attention Okay I knew things were going
[1:52:42] to be okay maybe not the way I want but
[1:52:44] they were going to be
[1:52:48] okay
[1:52:51] so then on November 28th the Lord took
[1:52:53] her
[1:52:56] home and so after the funeral in early
[1:52:59] December of 60 of
[1:53:04] 2006 I was praying I said Lord keep me
[1:53:09] busy keep me
[1:53:11] focused and keep me
[1:53:14] balanced my focus is beyond the curtain
[1:53:16] of
[1:53:18] time and I'm staying very
[1:53:22] busy traveling to many
[1:53:25] countries simply trying to encourage the
[1:53:29] bride I don't have any
[1:53:32] shortcuts uh your picture with me
[1:53:34] doesn't Mount
[1:53:38] anything but balance is very
[1:53:42] essential so for every one of us there's
[1:53:44] a line in the
[1:53:47] road now you don't know where that line
[1:53:49] is
[1:53:51] that's why you got to stay
[1:53:53] ready so we were married just over 40
[1:53:59] years and uh we have three
[1:54:01] children we have three
[1:54:04] grandchildren and one is married in
[1:54:08] Tucson and the other grandchild another
[1:54:10] one's going to be married next in March
[1:54:12] in
[1:54:17] Louisiana now a lot of times we have
[1:54:19] time for questions and
[1:54:22] answers not
[1:54:25] here but I was in Africa in a big church
[1:54:28] about 5,000
[1:54:33] people and they're translating into
[1:54:37] French and so as soon as I got through
[1:54:39] speaking the pastor jumps up and he says
[1:54:42] now we don't know when brother George is
[1:54:43] coming back does anyone have a
[1:54:48] question
[1:54:52] well they asked the
[1:54:54] question and it's
[1:54:57] translated and then you got to translate
[1:54:59] the
[1:55:01] answer they're not in a hurry to go any
[1:55:04] place there's there's 5,000
[1:55:07] people there's 10 cars
[1:55:10] outside and there's about uh 200
[1:55:15] motorcycles and maybe a thousand
[1:55:18] bicycles everybody else
[1:55:20] walked so time doesn't mean
[1:55:23] anything and so the only question I
[1:55:28] remember this sister
[1:55:31] asked she said well since the Lord took
[1:55:33] your wife why are you still wearing the
[1:55:38] ring I thought man these people see
[1:55:44] everything I said because my commitment
[1:55:46] to Rebecca wasn't until death do you
[1:55:48] part it's for eternity
[1:55:55] so we're staying very
[1:55:58] busy and uh my advice to you married
[1:56:03] people make her laugh every
[1:56:07] day if she's only laughing at your corny
[1:56:14] jokes now we have a formula in at least
[1:56:17] in this country the 50/50 you know uh
[1:56:22] you bring your half like in Spanish we
[1:56:24] say the the half orange you
[1:56:29] know but the better formula is
[1:56:34] 8020 each of you give
[1:56:38] 80 expecting
[1:56:41] 20 so it crosses works very
[1:56:45] fine but you see every day people are
[1:56:47] watching you watching how you live your
[1:56:54] Christianity and sometimes they see us
[1:56:56] good and sometimes they see us
[1:57:00] bad see Jesus said in in John
[1:57:05] 13:35 by this shall all men know that
[1:57:08] you're my
[1:57:11] disciples not because you have a little
[1:57:13] sign says I'm Elder
[1:57:18] somebody and not because you have the
[1:57:20] right belt
[1:57:22] buckle or because you're carrying your
[1:57:24] Bible just
[1:57:27] right but when you have love one to the
[1:57:32] other because they're watching
[1:57:36] us so we're busy today with translating
[1:57:39] and
[1:57:42] printing we're printing in Mexico and
[1:57:45] South
[1:57:47] America printing in
[1:57:50] China in the
[1:57:52] us and we're helping to to send money
[1:57:54] for food and rent in Venezuela they are
[1:57:57] very very bad off down
[1:58:06] there really bad but you know the gospel
[1:58:09] has reached some of the highest drug
[1:58:15] people many have been converted and
[1:58:18] baptized
[1:58:20] but we'll close with this one
[1:58:23] item this this brother had a a
[1:58:26] dream and so he says he's in heaven
[1:58:30] speaking with brother
[1:58:33] brandham I said no wait a minute you
[1:58:35] don't speak English and he doesn't speak
[1:58:40] Spanish he said I know but we could we
[1:58:43] spoke
[1:58:46] perfectly so they talked about a lot of
[1:58:48] things
[1:58:51] and um and so he noticed that on brother
[1:58:53] Ram's arm there's this this
[1:58:59] girl and so he looked at her real
[1:59:02] careful Ah that's young
[1:59:04] Rebecca and she gave him a big
[1:59:08] smile and she said you tell George I'm
[1:59:10] right here waiting where he told me to
[1:59:16] wait so may God bless you
[1:59:20] thank you for the
[1:59:24] [Applause]
