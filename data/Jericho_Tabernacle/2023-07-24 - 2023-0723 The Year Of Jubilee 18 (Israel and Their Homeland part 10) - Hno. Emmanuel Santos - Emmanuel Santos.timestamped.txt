[54:47] we ask for this Lord

[54:53] Christ amen amen
[54:56] is
[54:59] just like we're standing like to only

[55:05] and the Book of Joel the second chapter
[55:11] on the 23rd verse
[55:15] foreign
[55:18] once you have it
[55:22] Joe 223
[55:25] is
[55:37] be glad then hit children of Zion and
[55:40] rejoice in the Lord your God for yet
[55:42] given you the former Reign moderately
[55:44] and it will cause to come down for you
[55:47] the rain the former rain and the latter
[55:49] rain in the first month
[55:56] and the floors shall be full of Wheat
[55:58] and the vast shall overflow with the
[56:00] wine and oil
[56:01] restitution Los Angeles
[56:09] I will restore to you the years that the
[56:12] locusts had eaten the canker worm the
[56:14] caterpillar the Palmer worm a migrate
[56:16] Army which I sent among you
[56:28] you should eat planting and be satisfied
[56:30] and praise the name of the Lord your God
[56:32] hath that hath dwelt wondrously with you
[56:35] and my people shall never be ashamed
[56:38] God bless everything of his words
[56:45] as well
[57:05] if you have your Bibles open you can see
[57:07] where it says
[57:10] that those two Reigns
[57:16] that will take you back to the original
[57:18] condition in the beginning
[57:20] then the Lord says
[57:26] that he will restore the Bright Tree
[57:31] he will restore it back to its original
[57:33] condition
[57:36] now there are two trees of Life all
[57:40] those personas or two people okay
[57:43] that symbolizes the tree of life it's a
[57:46] Christian that is
[57:51] Christ has eternal life
[57:54] he's the author of eternal life
[57:57] and you his bride usted you have eternal
[58:02] life Christian you and Christ
[58:04] representative
[58:06] represent that tree of life
[58:09] the tree of life is that
[58:13] eternal life
[58:16] and God says he will restore us back to
[58:19] the original condition
[58:21] to that eternal life
[58:24] in the way that he will do so is
[58:28] using the former Reigns and using the
[58:32] lettering
[58:38] says in the exposition of the seven
[58:40] Church ages of the review of the ages
[58:46] and now it says God is going to restore
[59:11] for he cannot deny his word
[59:16] this is not the resurrection of the
[59:19] church
[59:27] God will take the church right back to
[59:29] Pentecost of the beginning
[59:41] that's with 120 received life
[59:46] and God wants to restore us back to the
[59:49] original condition original the original
[59:52] condition is
[59:54] eternal life
[59:57] Cinco
[59:59] in paragraph 65 this is
[1:00:02] now notice in verse 25
[1:00:06] it tells us why we need restoration
[1:00:11] is
[1:00:13] [Music]
[1:00:19] all but the root in a small bit of the
[1:00:24] stems
[1:00:28] now we are told that these insects are
[1:00:31] all one and the same in different stages
[1:00:34] that is right
[1:00:39] they are the Antichrist spirit
[1:00:41] manifested in organization in
[1:00:43] latinumination and denomination
[1:00:48] and false Doctrine Through the Ages
[1:00:55] you can see what takes you out of that
[1:00:57] original condition
[1:01:00] that condition of eternal life is
[1:01:04] perverting that Eternal world
[1:01:06] the false Doctrine
[1:01:09] the incorrect teachings
[1:01:12] and perverting the word
[1:01:17] you present a perverted life to the
[1:01:20] people
[1:01:21] there is no longer eternal life
[1:01:26] God wants to restore us back to eternal
[1:01:29] life
[1:01:29] and the way that it does
[1:01:33] he says that here in paragraph 66
[1:01:49] but it's going to bring his original
[1:01:52] planting back to original seeds
[1:01:56] he's doing it as a stated in verse 23
[1:02:01] by the teaching or or temprana or former
[1:02:06] rain in seguida vendra
[1:02:09] next will come the Harvest rain
[1:02:12] or rapturing faith
[1:02:17] now God wants to restore us back to the
[1:02:19] beginning
[1:02:22] the first thing he uses is former ring
[1:02:25] is which is the teaching
[1:02:28] Reigns correct if we're turning you back
[1:02:32] to the right teaching of the Bible
[1:02:39] getting you back to the right doctrines
[1:02:42] and teachings of the word
[1:02:45] then he will bring the latter ring
[1:02:49] that will manifest that which you were
[1:02:51] taught
[1:02:52] the Bible teaches you
[1:02:55] it says that you're saved by grace
[1:02:59] the nominations
[1:03:03] you're saved by writing your name in
[1:03:05] their book
[1:03:09] he brought that form of rain
[1:03:12] that correct
[1:03:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:33] that teaches you what's right
[1:03:37] you follow that process of the the
[1:03:40] teaching
[1:03:42] and then God will bring that latter rain
[1:03:45] okay
[1:03:46] that will manifest the fruits
[1:03:49] of that sea that was planted within you
[1:03:53] each everyone has a seed planted in them
[1:03:57] it's God's predestinated seats
[1:04:01] but if you don't have that correct
[1:04:03] teaching
[1:04:04] if you don't have that first form of
[1:04:07] rain
[1:04:08] that former rain
[1:04:11] then you cannot receive that lettering
[1:04:17] that will manifest that was brought to
[1:04:20] you back in the beginning with the
[1:04:21] teaching
[1:04:47] of what's written
[1:05:36] rapturing faith
[1:06:05] El Cielo
[1:06:07] and after this I look and behold the
[1:06:09] door was opened in heaven is
[1:06:14] and the first voice which I heard was
[1:06:17] that wherever trumpet talking to me said
[1:06:18] which said come up hither dios vares
[1:06:21] God's going to restore you
[1:06:24] through the former Reigns
[1:06:28] it's raptured faith
[1:06:32] iguan John and type Forest
[1:06:38] his uh redeemed body
[1:06:41] was restored and being raptured
[1:07:01] this body does not have the capacity
[1:07:05] to go up and have any places
[1:07:08] but one day you will have a body
[1:07:11] that will have that capacity
[1:07:30] you believe in a resurrection
[1:07:33] you will be in the resurrection you
[1:07:36] believe in the Rapture you will be in
[1:07:39] that rapture
[1:08:39] that you will manifest in that time
[1:08:48] when John is raptured
[1:08:51] Cielo he goes up to heaven
[1:08:55] we know the one who spoke to him was
[1:08:57] Christ
[1:08:59] and we see that John going up
[1:09:02] representative
[1:09:04] representing the church going up in the
[1:09:06] rapture
[1:09:07] okay
[1:09:09] in our Revelations chapter 4
[1:09:25] a throne was in heaven and one sat on
[1:09:28] the throne
[1:09:30] is
[1:09:40] and he said that sap was to look upon
[1:09:43] like a Jasper and a sardine stone and
[1:09:45] there was a rainbow around about The
[1:09:46] Throne inside like onto an emerald
[1:09:51] remember these Reigns
[1:09:55] will restore back to the original
[1:09:57] Italian
[1:09:59] and we help you manifest the original
[1:10:44] in
[1:10:51] the beginning
[1:11:04] we know that it's Christ it's yours it's
[1:11:06] God
[1:11:08] he sees him
[1:11:11] he sees them in his original condition
[1:11:14] before the foundation of the world
[1:11:17] because
[1:11:30] he sees it back in his original
[1:11:32] condition in the beginning
[1:11:42] I made a couple of things but let's go
[1:11:45] to questions and answers on Hebrews
[1:11:46] number three
[1:11:48] yeah
[1:11:50] this is
[1:11:55] the beginning we'll go back to our
[1:11:58] Hebrew teaching just for a few minutes
[1:12:46] and so forth
[1:13:00] a rainbow obviously has seven colors
[1:13:04] but in the next chapter on the fifth
[1:13:08] chapter
[1:13:11] he sees the same Throne
[1:13:15] going to the throne
[1:13:51] we'll take you back to the first day
[1:14:42] in his original condition
[1:15:14] right here
[1:15:39] when God made Man In His Image and his
[1:15:41] likeness
[1:15:42] Genesis
[1:15:46] Genesis
[1:15:51] there was no man yet to tell the soils
[1:15:58] now God had done made male and female
[1:16:01] and one theophany
[1:16:04] always teaches us
[1:16:07] that we were in God
[1:16:10] before the foundation of the world
[1:16:15] brings you back to the original
[1:16:17] condition
[1:17:02] you are always eternal
[1:17:21] it brings you back to that original
[1:17:23] condition
[1:17:28] s
[1:17:55] this man had no beginning of days
[1:17:58] nor End of Days
[1:18:35] so also Christ glorified not himself to
[1:18:38] be made in high
[1:18:49] priests
[1:18:53] also in another place thou art a priests
[1:18:56] Forever After the order of Michelson
[1:18:58] attention so please pay attention
[1:19:09] [Music]
[1:19:28] who in the days of the flesh when he had
[1:19:30] offered our prayers and supplications
[1:19:31] with strong crying and tears on Tim that
[1:19:34] was able to save him from death and he
[1:19:36] was hurt and he and that he feared
[1:19:44] though he were a son yet learned he
[1:19:46] obedience by the things which he
[1:19:48] suffered
[1:19:52] and be made perfect he become the author
[1:19:55] of Eternal salvation on taught them that
[1:19:56] obey him if he can say Pablo
[1:20:01] noticed that Paul wants to enter mourn
[1:20:04] this topic of melchized
[1:20:07] but not what it says in verse 11. he
[1:20:09] said
[1:20:12] we have many things to say
[1:20:16] and hard to be uttered
[1:20:28] the people that Paul is speaking to know
[1:20:33] he couldn't teach the basic teachings
[1:20:36] to these people
[1:20:39] because they did not want to accept the
[1:20:42] former Reigns
[1:20:44] and the former Reign is a type of
[1:20:46] teaching
[1:20:49] it's uh where they're sowing the seeds
[1:20:53] they couldn't accept the first Reigns
[1:20:57] so they cannot receive the second
[1:21:00] Reigns if you do not accept
[1:21:16] you must
[1:21:21] want to have to have to have the Holy
[1:21:24] Spirit
[1:21:28] if you do not accept the right teachings
[1:21:33] you cannot accept the power of that
[1:21:35] teaching
[1:21:36] foreign
[1:22:26] you have made that one teach you again
[1:22:29] which is the first principles of the
[1:22:30] Oracles of God
[1:22:35] and it becomes such as have need of milk
[1:22:38] and not of strong meat
[1:22:43] they were not able to accept the basics
[1:22:46] of the teachings of Paul foreign
[1:23:40] because the word is not just letter form
[1:23:43] it's the spiritual it's also spirit
[1:23:46] Ed
[1:23:48] how can you accept the invisible Spirits
[1:23:52] if you cannot accept the word that's
[1:23:55] written
[1:24:00] will teach you the principles
[1:24:03] and here comes the Holy Spirit the
[1:24:07] Divine portion
[1:24:09] that will reveal that what was written
[1:24:14] verse 14. it is
[1:24:29] full age even those by reason of those
[1:24:32] who have their senses exercise to
[1:24:34] discern both good and evil
[1:24:36] you can see between the lines
[1:24:41] that Paul was trying to bring
[1:24:45] a reign of teachings
[1:24:51] A Reign of Revelation
[1:25:15] de Cristo
[1:25:17] therefore leaving the principles of the
[1:25:19] doctrine of Christ
[1:25:23] El fundamento let us go on to a
[1:25:27] Perfection not laying again the
[1:25:28] foundation
[1:25:32] a repentance from their works and uh the
[1:25:35] faith toward
[1:25:37] godismos of doctrine of baptisms
[1:25:44] and at the resurrection of the Dead
[1:25:48] remember
[1:25:50] if you want to be in the resurrection
[1:25:53] you want to be in the Rapture
[1:25:57] believe that what is being taught of the
[1:25:59] Resurrection
[1:26:01] believe that you will be there because
[1:26:04] there is a teaching
[1:26:06] there is a form of rain
[1:26:09] of the Resurrection
[1:26:11] then there's the lottery
[1:26:14] that is the manifestation
[1:26:17] the power of the Resurrection
[1:26:26] there's a time where the seed is being
[1:26:29] planted
[1:26:30] and there's a time where that seed is
[1:26:33] being born
[1:26:34] but it has to be the right seat
[1:26:37] it has to be the right word that Eternal
[1:26:40] Word
[1:26:41] not a perverted word the
[1:26:45] Eternal Word
[1:26:46] and remembering
[1:26:49] he says he will restore is
[1:26:54] remember Christ in his bride is
[1:26:57] they symbolize that those that tree
[1:27:02] because both have eternal life
[1:27:07] was the first
[1:27:10] that manifested that eternal life is
[1:27:14] spiritually
[1:27:16] and also physically
[1:27:26] that
[1:27:31] there will be a future Resurrection
[1:27:37] but then the time comes
[1:27:40] or that power of Resurrection is being
[1:27:44] manifested
[1:27:46] we see that also
[1:27:48] Christopher in his physical body Murio
[1:27:51] died and Resurrected
[1:28:21] the only thing that was left was the
[1:28:24] roots
[1:28:25] and their cries on Calvary was cut down
[1:28:31] but his roots were planted on Friday
[1:28:35] and on Sunday
[1:28:38] he resurrected
[1:28:44] the tree was restoredo physical foreign
[1:29:28] Jesus raised on the eighth day
[1:29:40] that Jesus resurrected on the next day
[1:29:44] that's what the Bible shows
[1:29:54] usmana in the end of the Sabbath as it
[1:29:57] began to Dawn toward the first day of
[1:29:59] the week
[1:30:02] okay Mary Magdalene in the other Mary to
[1:30:05] see the soap
[1:30:07] and you see the latter rain that's
[1:30:09] coming
[1:30:10] see the manifestation of the powers
[1:30:14] that's going to bring forth that water
[1:30:17] to the rain to the seed this is
[1:30:25] a great earthquake for the angel of the
[1:30:28] Lord descended from Heaven it came and
[1:30:29] rolled back the Stone from the door and
[1:30:30] sat upon it
[1:30:38] foreign
[1:31:04] I am the resurrection in the life
[1:31:22] that he is the resurrection
[1:32:01] you will not receive the second ring
[1:32:05] yes
[1:32:09] Paul himself in First Corinthians 15.
[1:32:14] once again he's rebuking the people
[1:32:19] for not receiving the right teaching
[1:32:24] um
[1:32:25] Paul says the First Corinthians 15 12.
[1:32:28] this is
[1:32:34] now if Christ be preached that he rose
[1:32:37] from the dead how say some of among you
[1:32:39] that there is no resurrection of the
[1:32:41] dead
[1:32:44] but have there been a resurrection of
[1:32:46] the dead then Christ is not risen
[1:32:48] important
[1:32:51] see how important is to believe in the
[1:32:53] resurrection
[1:32:55] how important is to receive that former
[1:32:57] range
[1:32:59] to receive that at the reign of teaching
[1:33:03] verse 14 is
[1:33:07] if Christ be not risen says
[1:33:15] your faith is also in vain
[1:33:28] because we have testified of God that he
[1:33:31] raised up Christ
[1:33:32] whom he raised
[1:33:35] Muertos if so be that the dead rise
[1:33:39] foreign
[1:34:02] then they also which are falling asleep
[1:34:06] and Christ Our perished
[1:34:09] in this life we only hope in Christ
[1:34:15] we are of all men most
[1:34:18] Miserables
[1:34:19] but now is Christ rose from the dead
[1:34:22] premises
[1:34:24] and become the first fruits of them that
[1:34:27] slept
[1:34:28] so first Christ
[1:34:31] and then the rest come Christopher
[1:34:34] primero so Christ was the first
[1:34:36] that manifested eternal life Christopher
[1:34:39] primero Christ was the first
[1:34:41] that man that manifested the buffering
[1:34:45] then you come then you manifests
[1:34:55] you can also manifest the Resurrection
[1:34:59] being a tree of life
[1:35:13] for Since By Man Came Death and by man
[1:35:17] also the resurrection of the Dead
[1:35:24] for as in Adam all die even so in Christ
[1:35:27] shall Allah be made alive
[1:35:30] but every man in his own order Cristo
[1:35:33] Las primitias Christ the first fruit
[1:35:38] afterwards that is coming
[1:35:43] so the first one that manifests eternal
[1:35:45] life is Christ himself
[1:35:48] the author of eternal life
[1:35:51] but since you were in Christ
[1:35:54] they're in the beginning
[1:35:57] you have that same eternal life
[1:36:01] but Christ's the first one that
[1:36:03] manifests
[1:36:04] then you manifested
[1:36:10] you also do
[1:36:14] 23.
[1:36:39] let's see that Christ is the first fruit
[1:36:44] and how Christ had to resurrect on the
[1:36:46] eighth day this was after the day of
[1:36:49] Sabbath
[1:36:51] foreign
[1:37:22] you good okay levitico International
[1:37:26] Leviticus 3 9 23 23
[1:37:30] 9. you say yeah
[1:37:46] and the Lord's pick on tomorrow saying
[1:37:49] speak on the children of Israel and say
[1:37:50] unto them when you become when he become
[1:37:53] into the land which I gave unto you and
[1:37:54] shall reap the Harvester of then you
[1:37:56] shall bring the chief of the first first
[1:37:57] fruits of your Harvest onto the priest
[1:38:01] so they're in that verse
[1:38:05] you can see there's a former and a lot
[1:38:07] of rain
[1:38:10] where there's where a rain where the
[1:38:13] seed is being sown
[1:38:17] and that where it's being picked up what
[1:38:20] was planted
[1:38:22] la
[1:38:34] and he shall weigh the Sheep before the
[1:38:36] Lord to be accepted for you on them on
[1:38:38] tomorrow after the Sabbath the priest
[1:38:39] shall weave it wave it
[1:38:43] so Jesus Christ
[1:38:46] like it says in the Bible
[1:38:49] that he resurrected
[1:38:53] after the day of Sabbath
[1:39:09] the first fruits or the fruits that were
[1:39:11] gathered there in the Gathering of the
[1:39:13] fruits
[1:39:16] those are the first ones that came into
[1:39:18] maturity
[1:39:20] and they grab the first fruit
[1:39:23] and they will wave them
[1:39:27] presenting the fruits
[1:39:31] showing or presenting that these are the
[1:39:33] first fruits that came into maturity
[1:39:36] I remember it was Christ that came into
[1:39:39] eternal life foreign
[1:39:56] and a physical maturity
[1:40:02] Christ when he resurrected
[1:40:05] he was young
[1:40:10] primero Christ is the first Kimani
[1:40:13] Fiesta that manifests the
[1:40:17] Eternal youth
[1:40:20] element
[1:40:21] teaches us
[1:40:24] that a human being
[1:40:28] reaches its highest peak
[1:41:04] that'll always stay in a mature state
[1:41:10] let us take a
[1:41:12] fruit naturally
[1:41:14] in fact yesterday
[1:41:36] seven days
[1:41:41] to be able to eat them
[1:41:56] when they're young
[1:42:10] gradually death begins to enter that
[1:42:13] body
[1:42:14] there's a time or that banana
[1:42:17] where it's immature is
[1:42:22] maturity
[1:42:27] but if it passes that maturity
[1:42:37] the death will enter that banana
[1:42:40] it will start getting black
[1:42:42] just like the human body
[1:42:46] that's why Christ is the first fruits of
[1:42:49] the Resurrection
[1:42:51] your body being the seed that's being
[1:42:54] sown the body of Christ
[1:43:19] on the future
[1:44:12] always be young
[1:44:15] thank you
[1:44:22] foreign
[1:44:36] and you shall count on to you the
[1:44:38] tomorrow after the Sabbath

[1:45:50] those are seven sabbaths
[1:45:54] seven by seven plus seven or forty nine
[1:45:57] seven times seven times seven is 49.
[1:46:02] and you add one more day to the number
[1:46:05] seven
[1:46:24] that was manifested with the first
[1:46:27] foreign
[1:46:41] and sins
[1:46:47] now Christ completed that feast
[1:46:54] he was the first
[1:46:58] that manifested that eternal life
[1:47:01] in its maturity
[1:47:04] then we'll come after more after him
[1:47:08] when he resurrected
[1:47:10] it was the first one
[1:47:13] but then after him
[1:47:17] the Saints of Old Testament
