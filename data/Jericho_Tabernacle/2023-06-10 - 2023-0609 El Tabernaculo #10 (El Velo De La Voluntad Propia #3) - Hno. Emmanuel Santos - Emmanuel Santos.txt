we'll laugh alone [Music] when the qualified we making him [Music] will go here I am [Music] we'll see [Music] weekly [Music] tonight [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] brother Brandon calls it an omnipotence [Music] this is a word that's also in us which is possible in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen she says you're standing we're going to be reading two scriptures the first is in Hebrews 10 19. the Bible says having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by the new by a New and Living Way which she have consecrated for us through the veil is to say his flesh and having a high priest over the house of God I said let us draw near with the true heart and full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscious and our bodies washed with pure water now in second Corinthians 3 14. but their minds were blinded foreign and in English it says their minds were blinded they cannot receive it is but uh which remaineth for until this day the same Veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which Veil is done away in Christ but even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away it goes to the first veil of the outside you receive it in your heart but in order to receive it in your heart you break the veil okay God bless the reading of his word this evening I want to continue the theme of the veil of self-will that's a name okay brother Brian I'm assigned to that Veil yeah I'm going to read it from Revelation chapter four number two then how do how do we get into this now remember there was a veil um available Christ is enthroned who comes in metolistas whoever will you know what that you know what that Veil is that veils your heart from it are you ready the veil is called self-will all right now like we studied in the past and those velos there's two veils the exterior Veil is we could see that the outside Veil represents this body represents this flesh and the inside but the brand-up teaches us he calls itself now when a person is born in this world they're born with both fails and both veils are very similar thou shall make the Tabernacle with ten curtains of man which is the outside Veil is it has a worldly nature another quote in the same message countdown uh this is notice the natural man even counts backwards I said he did things backwards he counts backwards 654-3-20 see he goes back and starts counting he's all 10 is a bad number that's right to start with 10 is a bad number they had ten tribes of Israel and that was just all Cardinals so you can see that this Veil that was made of ten curtains is this body is a fleshly body it's not subject to the things of God when someone's born again you fight against your body you've got two types of natures the spirit of God inside your heart but you still have to deal with this worldly body [Music] it takes you out of this worldly uh this fleshly world now that's the first veil of the outside now let's go back to Exodus 26 3. now when that Veil from the outside is opened and it creates five and five grace and grace now verse [Music] now when it speaks of the first five this is the five curtains shall be coupled together one to another and the other five curtains shall be coupled one to another this is and thou shall make loops loops of blue upon the edge of one curtain of the Selvage and the coupling and likewise thou shall make in the uttermost edge of another curtain in the coupling of the second 50 Loops that are making one curtain and 50 Loops shall thou make in the edge of the curtain that is in the coupling of the second that the loops may take hold one of another now when that Veil is turned into five and five uh the Bible says in verse it says that it'll have 50 Loops the number 50 is the number of what or not it also has 50 loops Exodus 26 6. this is and thou shalt make 50 taxes of gold and couple the curtains together with the tattoos and it shall be one Tabernacle now both those five they're works of redemption it's the Redemption of the soul and the Redemption of your body it gives you an internal Grace and a Grace to take you out of this world from your sinful condition and also give you a jubility that'll free you from this world of sin literally take you out of here one takes the world out of you and what will make you come out of the world you're literally ascend already say s now when both fives they joined together again since there's 50 Loops it says they had to use touches of gold they'd couple each one both curtains with those golden touches because gold represents deity it represents God's spirit that's in you so when you receive the Jubilee and then you bring both jubilees together and you'll be with God yes it's a jubilee from God a specific Jubilee of the Holy Spirit was 50 blue loops it's the color of Truth this is UNA Gracia so what is Grace one of The Graces we'll give you Fellowship in truth the second grace will do the same and as he joined them both there's a portion of the Holy Spirit there's a work of the holy spirit that will join both yes it's by the holy spirit so those 50 tattoos of gold it's a jubilee of the Holy Spirit the way the Holy Spirit operates it's through faith nothing can be done without faith there's something that brother Branham teaches something that always stood out to me speaking about the denominations he said that for 2000 years the same Holy Spirit has been adapted or has been bound by denominational beliefs foreign but the same holy spirit it's got a jubilee so come to me and save me they make both Graces that you have be a work of the Holy Ghost in your life they say is the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me decorations to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord now Jubilee is through the preaching of the gospel God anoints a man to speak the words then you believe the words now you in believing the words you're anointed by the spirit it has an anointing it's a very powerful anointing and that anointing is it's through faith you should believe if you believe you activate that anointing in your life that anointing separates from you that anointing is the Holy Ghost it's the anointing of faith you limit the anointing foreign the anointing of the Holy Ghost foreign Faith Can See Beyond and you can see yourself healed will make what's in your heart be manifested in your body let's go to First Peter 1 23. that's in you okay that's in your heart it's a seed of faith foreign but of incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever first of all since we're born again it's the word of God but it hasn't grown to a complete maturity that's why you have trial after trying and you also receive blessing upon blessings just like the same is is nights the day comes again and the Night Comes again so come the blessings of God and also the test is it's causing the seed that's within you to reach a full maturity because it's a seed of faith in Galatians 3 16 now to Abraham and who is Abraham the father of Faith Abram foreign but it's there faith Faith causes that is why we're the seed of Faith Abraham is the father of the faith so Abraham had to wait 25 years the Bible says he did not doubt in faith what you need is up there further ahead and makes it come to a present time Faith believes up there in the future but you know God does fulfill his promise it can see beyond Faith doesn't speak to this mouth but it can't speak Faith Can't touch with his hands but it can touch God in another way we've got five natural senses where the seed of faith is and he calls it the Holy Spirit and when you yourself because it's the veil of self-will you want to live by the five outside senses or do you want to live in the holiest of holies and the sense that's found in there is Faith so if you live in the holiest of holy Faith tells you that what's out there in the future it's something sure you buy your decision you decide where you want to live they're in the veil in the outside well you've only got the five senses or do you want to live in the holiest of holies that's super sense can speak to God can touch God protects where you go a person that's been born again can live in various places in both places because we're still in this body Cristiano but also Christians that's been born again can take the self-decision when you do that is it's easier for God to speak to you it's easier for you to receive God but when you're out in the outer courts and God wants to speak to you honestly you don't really pay attention you don't want to listen you're very focused on the things outside the outside world your whole mentality all your thoughts is the revealed word that's what feeds you well you can also live in the outside world and feed the black dog this body is the black dog but the seed of faith is the white dog feed the white dog and the black dog will be silent but now you feed the black dog pero Blanco the white dog will have tons of difficulty to overcome [Music] you've got the seed in you is to have fellowship with God surrender to God that's where that seed is that's your decision because myself personally I felt so so filthy by the things that I've done I've said I've seen there's other times not to boast about myself I feel like the devil can't even bother me [Music] sometimes I feel so filthy for being out there then there's other times I feel so clean I I did I clean my own self sure I did it well it was him but I made the decision I broke the Veil or do you want to live in the Holy place the affections or you want to live in the holiest of holies the sense that's there is faith or the single sense that's in the holiest of holies can control the rest of the senses it's just you and him beautiful Elementary the notice brother Branham says I'm going to read the the quote who is God this is when the inspiration of the holy spirit is here to inspire you remember remember God will make your body come into your confession into the outer courts foreign [Music] through the super sense of faith this body has to obey light giving God times if you don't give God time then you won't get fat Omni potential you won't cause that omnipotence to start to practice that's already in you you've already got a tree potentially in the form of a seed you've got the power potential potentially foreign this world doesn't affect you if you live in the holiest of holies live by faith that's the battle is practice for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world what is Born overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith and the seed that's within you is a seed of faith when you're born again it starts to grow is it starts to gain practice it starts to know what are the its abilities just like a person that plays Sports and the more they practice they get better they know more what they and he tries to grab the handle and what you cannot do it you're practicing to practice your faith for now you're the one that's got to open the door just like you see you're moving through the room and then the baby gets to the door what does the baby do the baby wants to get out it turns to look at mama and papa they've got the power to open the door you've been born again you're practicing faith and you know what God can do don't allow them to discourage after some time that babies got there crawling then it's walking then it's running a motorcycle faith is advancing now that seed that's in you the equivalent to that the vocabulary of the Tabernacles is the Ark of the Covenant the branches that the art is the word he says that the ark also represents the heart was not the only thing in the holiest of holy it had a lid on top of it which on English is called The Mercy Seat it's Hollow it's God's Throne a place already designated for him was above that Throne foreign a place separated for God now what's required is you break the veil surrender to God and your spirit will come so that sea that's already in you this is doing whatever you please voluntarily unto God the light comes and it activates what's already there not that it's going to play something there I'll go something's already there is the holy spirit's just activating what's already there is it's the seed of faith I'm going to Omit a lot we're going to go to the communion paragraph 45 that William Branham isn't the same one tonight if someone someone back there would say William Branham William Branham he was a ranked scandala Branham a rank Rascal C because I was born of Charles and Ella Branham and in their nature I was a sinner I came to the world as a liars and all the habits of the world laid right in me but down in there other nature present bienada see predestinated in there by God in this same body two Natures well I only cater to one I could as a baby daddy yeah but first thing I know I became a liar become everything that's a sinner because I raised up that way but down there was a little speck of Life all the time what was it Branham there was another William Branham see a little spot of eternal life down there from the genes of God the word of God was placed in there each one of you can think of similar things see it was working then I look up to the trees and I think you fall last year and why are you back there again who brought you here you see it was that eternal life working in the body and one day as I walked on that voice talking so foreign there's something there's something in me calling Anton says then I was born again that little life was laying there the life of water was poured upon it then it began to grow is to never be remembered again me no more now we're Justified as if we never sinned in the presence of God foreign to govern my life you've got two parts in you you can be born again and struggle with the things of the world because this body is this body is carnal but you can get to the point where you live in the holiest of holies and everything that happens everything that dominates everything you can see is by faith but it requires practice a man to live by faith is the father of Faith Abraham Lafayette the face or that anointing I mean where the brand also calls it the Holy Spirit that's in you what that Faith also does it offers a protection to the things of the world you can get to the point where you live so much by faith honestly there's not many things or nothing in this world that can affect you you'll have to overcome but it'll get to the point you live so much in that Holy place that faith will overcome every circumstance every one of the five senses they'll have to respond to the super sins was Abraham when the Bible speaks of the armor of God when it speaks of faith it says it's the shield of Faith what does the shield it's used during the time of battles and it's used as protection and that's what faith does for you Faith the darts of the enemy will come the enemy will come to attack but your protection that's already in you you've already got it you just have to practice how to use the shield in Genesis 15 1 after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and they die exceeding great rewards the seed that's in you is the word of God it's the seed of faith and God is the word that God placed in you yes it works as a shield it protects you you get discouraged terribly discouraged you've got no faith but you keep believing in God Abraham was a man of faith God tells us to Abraham isn't it it's in Genesis and God says I am thy shield and you're exceeding great rewards and God proved this to Abraham in the previous chapter he was exposed to the things of the world and he was taken prisoner by the kings of various nations of the world or stay where he was since Abraham live by faith he didn't care the risk of death he went and rescued his nephew even though there were many more with the other nations I believe the Bible says there were only 300 men that were with Abraham but since Abraham live by faith he knew this God was faithful to his words God made the promise he would give him that promise so since he knew God would give him that promise and he was going to go to that battle he was going to rescue and there was nothing nothing that would touch him because Abraham live by faith that's why in the next chapter School God told him I am your Shield we can imagine when I went there frequency I went with faith I knew you wouldn't let me die there was a pending promise that you still owe me I promise there's promises in your life so when the tests come the battles come have faith God is faithful to his word do you confront the enemy confess with faith there's no way that situation can die you live by faith God will give you the reward [Music] that you won't like it that's where faith is that makes contact with the world of God the only way you can come in contact with God is through faith foreign answer you there's two omnipotence God over there out there trying to speak to the god that's in you and it's not you that believes in God it's the sea that's in you that believes in God is break the vent break the Veil and believe in God in believing in God he'll bring you in he'll submerge you into a world of Faith where everything is possible not everything is instant always possible everything is possible that's why it's necessary to live by faith let us all stand let us pray Heavenly Father [Music] that's in them [Music] [Music] and is thrown in the place set aside for him create a world of Faith where all things are possible bless your people Lord with the instructions the power that's already in them I bless you [Music] amen God bless brother Emmanuel [Music] is ever has everything to me is [Music] once again he's ever seen to me please [Music] [Music] another mother sister and my brother [Music] [Music] when I'm
