[33:31] I'd like to welcome each and every one
[33:34] of you
[33:36] and I'd like to greet you on the
[33:39] precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[33:44] such a good time to be here in this
[33:47] Easter morning
[33:51] this day it represents so much for us
[33:54] today yesterday
[33:58] that's why we're a Christian today
[34:01] that's why that's why I serve my Lord
[34:04] Jesus Christ
[34:07] because he did not only die on the cross
[34:11] many men have suffered for the people
[34:15] many people have been Martyrs what's the
[34:19] cause
[34:20] but there was only one man that Rose the
[34:23] third day
[34:25] and that is our Lord Jesus Christ
[34:29] that's why I'm a Christian today
[34:32] because we're serving a living God
[34:37] not only that
[34:39] but he gave us the same resurrection
[34:42] power today
[34:45] he gave us the same promise
[34:48] that we will be raised from our sins
[34:53] we will be raised one of these days
[34:57] and our body our flesh will be tooken
[35:01] off
[35:02] and we'll step into our glorious bodies
[35:07] what a beautiful day we're living in
[35:09] today
[35:11] for a Christian Easter is every day
[35:16] we're a Christian the resurrection is
[35:18] every day
[35:20] I'm so glad for that amen
[35:24] amen I want to go straight to the
[35:27] scriptures
[35:29] I don't want to take your time
[35:32] if you'd like to turn with me to
[35:35] [Music]
[35:42] and I would like to continue my my
[35:44] thought on pressed in between
[35:50] and my subtitle is is the daybreaker
[35:58] it's such a um beautiful thing to have
[36:01] service right at Daybreak amen
[36:06] this is when Jesus started to walk out
[36:09] of that tomb is
[36:12] right before Daybreak there was Jesus's
[36:16] resurrected body
[36:20] and when the women went out to go go and
[36:24] and go and to minister to the tune
[36:30] by the morning he was gone
[36:33] by the morning life took place in his
[36:37] body
[36:39] amen that's what we're waiting on today
[36:44] amen amen
[36:46] it says for to meet to live is Christ
[36:50] and to die is gain
[36:54] Philippians 1 21
[36:59] but if I live in the flesh this is the
[37:02] fruit of my labor yet what I shall chew
[37:06] uh what should I why shall choose I want
[37:09] not marciel Vivir is
[37:15] for I am in a straight betwixtube having
[37:19] a desire to depart and to be with Christ
[37:22] for it which is far better
[37:29] yes
[37:33] nevertheless to abide in the flesh is
[37:35] more needful for you
[37:40] all right we're going to go ahead and
[37:42] stop right there let us bow our heads
[37:47] Heavenly Father celestial
[37:50] what a special day that we're living in
[37:52] today
[37:55] Lord to know that we are walking in the
[37:58] fruits of your resurrection
[38:02] that each and every Christian today
[38:06] has that Earnest of their Resurrection
[38:10] they have your Holy Spirit father God
[38:15] lord we're not looking for for a day in
[38:18] the future father God
[38:21] lord we're not looking for events father
[38:25] Lord because the resurrection is not an
[38:28] event
[38:30] you said I am the resurrection in life
[38:35] father Resurrection is here this morning
[38:40] Christian every bride this morning
[38:44] is holding that Earnest
[38:48] Resurrection Lord we believe it with all
[38:51] of our hearts
[38:52] father we thank you for everything
[38:54] you've done
[38:56] we ask Lord that you just take control
[39:00] of this place this morning
[39:04] Lord we submit ourselves to you
[39:07] we asked Lord that you forgive us of all
[39:10] of our sins and all of our iniquities
[39:14] all of our transgressions
[39:17] Lord that you may come and Abode with us
[39:22] give us a little piece of Eternity this
[39:25] morning
[39:27] we ask all these things in the precious
[39:29] name of Jesus Christ
[39:33] amen and amen amen amen amen you may be
[39:37] seated
[39:42] so my subtitle this morning is
[39:44] daybreaker
[39:47] I would like to read another scripture
[39:49] in Isaiah
[39:52] Isaiah 60 is
[39:55] verses one and two verses
[40:01] and I got this scripture actually from
[40:04] listening to the message Shalom from
[40:06] Brother Branham
[40:10] the Bible says
[40:12] arise Shine for thy light has come and
[40:17] the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee
[40:21] responses
[40:26] amen amen the glory of God has risen
[40:30] upon thee La Gloria de dios
[40:33] but then in verse 2 it says
[40:37] for Behold The Darkness shall cover the
[40:40] Earth and gross Darkness the people but
[40:44] the Lord shall rise upon thee and His
[40:46] glory shall be upon
[40:53] theeakyones Gloria
[41:00] brother Branham he read the scripture
[41:04] and uh he he preached the message Shalom
[41:08] two times
[41:10] the word shaloms mean peace
[41:15] and brother Branham preached this
[41:18] message
[41:19] and when he preached it he read the
[41:22] scripture
[41:24] and he said that there was a mix between
[41:27] light and darkness in this world
[41:32] now when brother Branham he preached
[41:35] these messages
[41:37] the first message he preached was I
[41:40] believe uh Sierra Sierra Vista okay
[41:45] here down south in in Arizona
[41:49] and he didn't preach it in a big church
[41:52] he didn't preach it with hundreds of
[41:55] people
[41:56] brother Bradham he actually said there
[41:59] was about 30 to 40 people in that little
[42:01] cottage
[42:05] he called it a house or he called it a
[42:08] cottage
[42:09] and he said this is my New Year's
[42:12] message that I'm gonna preach for 1964.
[42:18] and I'm gonna go preach it over there in
[42:21] Phoenix
[42:23] he said but at first I want to preach it
[42:26] to you
[42:28] he said because I feel more freedom to
[42:31] say more things to this little people
[42:35] [Music]
[42:38] so he he had more freedom to express
[42:41] more of the word to these people
[42:46] and then he said because when he goes
[42:49] down to Phoenix
[42:51] it was a convention there was Methodist
[42:55] there was apostolics there was Pentecost
[43:00] there was many groups many names
[43:04] is and he said there's a mystery of
[43:07] people
[43:09] there's unbelief and belief at the same
[43:12] time in that place
[43:16] so he couldn't truly Express himself the
[43:19] way he wanted to know
[43:21] because there was the denominations he
[43:24] was preaching to foreign
[43:46] that that these two messages one was
[43:49] directly for the Bride of Jesus Christ
[43:54] and then the other one he was directing
[43:57] it to a mixture of people
[44:01] and and his message was Shalom peace
[44:06] there is light
[44:07] Shalom pass I lose brother Branham he
[44:10] says in the message Shalom
[44:13] he says my New Year's message is to the
[44:17] church elected in Jesus Christ
[44:22] now now this one was preached at um in
[44:26] the the 12th day of January
[44:30] this is in Sierra Vista Sierra Vista and
[44:34] he says this my New Year's message is to
[44:37] the church elected in Christ in Jesus
[44:40] Christ
[44:44] for 1964
[44:48] not just to the church groups
[44:52] Iglesias but the elect lady
[44:57] or the the elect the lady of the church
[45:00] Christ's bride
[45:02] de la Iglesia Novia de Cristo see that's
[45:06] who I'm addressing
[45:09] see brother Brandon wasn't
[45:11] talking to the denominations
[45:14] he was talking directly to the bride
[45:19] we're facing here in our two subjects
[45:23] that we read
[45:25] the two scriptures rather a very
[45:28] contrast
[45:32] in Isaiah it says it is arise and shine
[45:36] for the glory of God has come upon you
[45:39] respondes
[45:42] the light is here
[45:44] and then the very next verse
[45:48] he says gross darkness is upon this
[45:52] people
[45:54] and then we are we are in a mystery of
[45:58] light and darkness
[46:01] then my address to the church is Shalom
[46:05] peace
[46:08] let's find out what's what's it all
[46:11] about
[46:13] we're facing this year with both both
[46:16] darkness and lightest
[46:20] We Are The World is one of the most
[46:23] chaotic times of Darkness that it's ever
[46:25] stood
[46:29] and yet it's standing in again the Most
[46:33] Blessed light that it's ever shined in
[46:36] yeah
[46:40] brother Branham said there was a mixed
[46:43] mixed Darkness
[46:45] but light and darkness they can't abide
[46:49] in the same place
[46:52] in Genesis 1 2 in Genesis it said that
[46:56] the Earth was full of darkness and it
[46:59] was void and it was without forms
[47:04] but then the spirit of God began to
[47:07] hover around the waters
[47:12] and the first thing God said out of his
[47:15] spoken word
[47:17] he said let there be light
[47:21] and brother or the Bible says that light
[47:24] came out and it was good
[47:29] and then the Bible says that he divided
[47:32] the light from the darkness
[47:36] there was a time where light and
[47:39] darkness there was a mystery
[47:43] but then he says I'm gonna divide the
[47:46] light from the darkness
[47:50] and what life does whenever the day
[47:53] breaks
[47:55] so so Daybreak means
[47:58] it means whenever the first beams of
[48:01] light begin to shoot out from the sky
[48:03] significance
[48:07] it's been the darkest it's ever been in
[48:10] in the 24 hours that we live in
[48:16] and right when it gets so dark
[48:21] a beam of light begins to shoot out
[48:25] and it's a day break yes
[48:28] and that's what the light begins to do
[48:31] when it separates from the darkness
[48:35] it presses that Darkness where the
[48:38] darkness gets darker and darker and
[48:40] darker is
[48:44] and it pushes it out
[48:48] feel the the sun uh rules the whole day
[48:54] that's that's the day that we're living
[48:56] in brother Brandon
[48:59] we're living in the day of
[49:04] where we're pressed in between light and
[49:07] darkness
[49:09] we are in the most glorious day that
[49:12] we've ever been
[49:15] where the full manifestation of the word
[49:18] has come to the bride manifestation
[49:22] it didn't come to the denominations
[49:24] anymore
[49:26] it didn't come to those that want to
[49:28] organize
[49:30] no he goes to those uh few people
[49:37] and he Reveals His full unadulterated
[49:40] word to those people
[49:44] his word is the light
[49:47] brother Branham said when in his spoken
[49:50] word came out
[49:53] he said let there be light
[49:57] and when the light came forth
[50:01] that was the manifestation of the word
[50:03] manifestation that's that's what we're
[50:07] in today
[50:09] you know so when I started listening to
[50:11] the message Shalom
[50:14] my first time listening to it
[50:17] I said praise God he's talking about the
[50:19] Rapture because
[50:22] he kept talking about the Daybreak the
[50:25] day break
[50:28] but then he began to say
[50:31] that the light is the manifested word
[50:37] whenever God said let there be light
[50:42] when the light came forth cuando saliola
[50:45] that was the manifested word
[50:49] whenever the light showed up
[50:52] and that's where we're living in today
[50:55] in the day of the manifested word
[50:59] in the day where the full word is
[51:02] revealed only to the bride
[51:04] complete when it comes down to the
[51:07] denomination
[51:09] yeah they'll get Jesus Christ on the
[51:12] cross
[51:14] yeah they'll go back to the tomb where
[51:17] he rose up
[51:19] and they'll order those things back then
[51:24] but they don't know that the resurrected
[51:27] Christ is here today
[51:31] they say oh well well I have his Spirit
[51:34] he said oh crap but his full
[51:37] manifestation is his word manifestation
[51:41] completely it's his unadulterated word
[51:44] that has been given to us today
[51:48] that is our light today
[51:52] and the more light
[51:54] and the more Daybreak that we see
[51:59] the more the pressing of the darkness
[52:02] there is
[52:05] people say why why is it so dark in this
[52:09] world
[52:11] why is it so evil
[52:14] why are all these things happening in
[52:16] the streets
[52:18] why why is people leaving the faith
[52:23] all these things happening why is it
[52:25] happening
[52:27] it's because light is pressing towards
[52:31] it is
[52:33] because the coming of the sun is getting
[52:37] closer and closer and closer
[52:42] and darkness cannot live in life
[52:48] the Bible says that the devil only has a
[52:52] short time
[52:55] so he's seeking those that he can devour
[53:00] why because he's only got a little time
[53:03] of darkness
[53:06] and as that light comes forth more and
[53:09] more
[53:11] that Darkness gets pressed
[53:15] and brother as Bride As Christians of of
[53:19] the Bible and of uh the message
[53:24] we're in between the pressings
[53:29] we're in between life and death
[53:32] brother Brandon says in the junction of
[53:35] time
[53:37] [Music]
[53:39] now notice again that
[53:42] not only that that when hell is turned
[53:46] loose
[53:51] all of Heaven is turned loose
[53:55] when the enemy comes in like a flood
[53:57] amigo
[53:59] uh the spirit of God raises up a
[54:02] standard against it
[54:05] and these two forces is always showed up
[54:09] at that Junction
[54:13] so there's that changing of time and
[54:17] once that changing happens
[54:21] Heaven and Hell the enemy and God are
[54:25] there
[54:28] that's where we're living in is
[54:31] we're even in our bodies we're living in
[54:34] that
[54:35] where there's light and darkness in our
[54:38] own flesh where
[54:42] um Paul says whenever I want to do
[54:44] something good my body says
[54:48] every time I try to do something good
[54:51] evil is present with me
[54:55] Jesus was praying to God one time
[54:59] he said these people are not of the
[55:02] world
[55:04] these children are not of the world
[55:07] but he says please Lord don't take them
[55:10] out of the world
[55:12] let them be the light of the world
[55:16] you're not of the world Saints
[55:19] you guys are not of this place
[55:23] we can't get attached to this place
[55:28] my inspiration of this message
[55:31] came with our precious brother
[55:34] our brother Daniel and then I started
[55:37] thinking of all the others passing
[55:41] all those that I've seen that were were
[55:44] solid in Jesus Christ
[55:48] I saw their body dwindling away
[55:53] there was an anchor to Heaven
[55:58] they were anchored
[56:11] what they were anchored was in Christ
[56:13] Jesus
[56:16] Christ they were in they were in pressed
[56:20] in between life and death is
[56:23] there was a changing of bodies
[56:26] there was a changing of Dimensions
[56:30] the bride is going into the same
[56:33] transition
[56:35] we can't be attached to our riches
[56:40] we can be attached to those things
[56:43] we can be attached to our church names
[56:47] we can't be attached to I'm I'm a
[56:50] message believer
[56:53] um
[56:53] all those names and all those things
[56:56] that are are of the world
[56:59] are part of the darkness
[57:02] and that Darkness has to be pressed out
[57:07] but if there's a seed a predestinated
[57:10] seed inside of you
[57:13] that light that's always been in you
[57:18] once that light hits the ground
[57:21] it has to be life that comes forth
[57:26] we cannot be attached to these worldly
[57:29] things
[57:31] but when that change happens
[57:34] we're ready for that change
[57:37] we're ready for that body change
[57:41] we're ready to see our loved ones once
[57:44] more
[57:46] why because we're attached to Christ
[57:51] amen amen
[57:54] so uh brother Branham says in the
[57:57] message how can I overcome
[58:01] he says lady osia Church age is the
[58:04] grandest of all Church ages
[58:09] because it's the ending of time
[58:13] and the blending of Eternity
[58:16] and then it's the greatest sinful age
[58:21] it's it's more sinful than this eight um
[58:25] this age than they're ever that there
[58:28] ever has been
[58:30] and the powers of Satan is many times
[58:34] harder to fight against than it was in
[58:36] any age
[58:42] here back in the early ages
[58:46] a Christian could for his profession be
[58:49] being
[58:50] um of being a church
[58:54] Iglesia of belonging to
[58:56] Christo could be beheaded for it
[59:00] he could be killed
[59:02] and put out of his misery
[59:05] and go to meet God quickly
[59:09] but now the enemy has come in
[59:13] the name of the church
[59:16] and it's so deceiving
[59:19] this is the great age of deception
[59:25] so this age the devil's not trying to
[59:28] take your life anymore
[59:32] that's easy
[59:34] we see our brothers and our sisters go
[59:36] on with the Lord
[59:38] and they step the onto the other side
[59:41] with courage
[59:44] brother that's easy
[59:46] from stepping from One Life to another
[59:50] but the devil because the time has
[59:53] changed
[59:55] it's a blending of Time and Eternity
[1:00:00] that the devil he will come into the
[1:00:03] very churches
[1:00:05] that profess Jesus Christ
[1:00:09] and try to not not take your life
[1:00:13] but they're trying to take the light
[1:00:16] from the church
[1:00:18] what is the light the manifested word of
[1:00:22] this day
[1:00:24] the unadulterated
[1:00:37] brother if you really truly understood
[1:00:39] what church is
[1:00:43] sometimes me as a human says we can we
[1:00:48] can get into our routines
[1:00:50] and say oh okay I got to do do my duty
[1:00:54] for the church
[1:00:57] I gotta help out and it's all for the
[1:01:01] honor and the glory of God
[1:01:03] but if we truly understood when we sit
[1:01:06] here and listen to the words
[1:01:11] the word is feeding you vitamins every
[1:01:14] day
[1:01:16] see brother my flesh
[1:01:20] my flesh is crying out for dust every
[1:01:23] day
[1:01:25] the brother God said he said dust you
[1:01:29] are and dust you shall return
[1:01:32] so my body is crying out for the dust
[1:01:37] brother sometimes I get so tired
[1:01:40] and it's barely the middle of the day
[1:01:45] and I think to myself
[1:01:48] I'm so like a brother brother
[1:01:51] uh Michael knew that I was going to take
[1:01:54] a nap right now I'm very disappointed
[1:01:59] and my wife says it's because you're
[1:02:03] you're probably uh deficient on iron or
[1:02:06] potassium or something like that
[1:02:12] it's it's some kind of vitamin that I'm
[1:02:15] deficient
[1:02:18] so what I do is I take those vitamins to
[1:02:20] get more energy
[1:02:24] and potassium magnesium
[1:02:28] iron
[1:02:30] where do they belong where do I get them
[1:02:33] from
[1:02:34] the very dirt that I came from
[1:02:38] my body is crying out for dirt
[1:02:41] it's crying out for the very dust that I
[1:02:44] came out of it
[1:02:47] when a woman is pregnant
[1:02:50] oh man
[1:02:51] sisters you guys begin to eat fries and
[1:02:55] and ice cream
[1:02:59] you throw ketchup on anything
[1:03:02] what is it your body
[1:03:05] your body begins to thirst for the
[1:03:08] vitamins
[1:03:11] we've heard many times
[1:03:14] um uh women eating clay
[1:03:21] I'm eating clay why because the minerals
[1:03:25] are in that clay
[1:03:28] brother Brandon talks about the young
[1:03:31] man that was eating bicycle petals
[1:03:36] why he needed sulfur in his body
[1:03:40] brother Branham actually said his body
[1:03:43] projected him to the
[1:03:45] sulfurt and that poor little kid didn't
[1:03:48] know what he was doing but he was
[1:03:49] gnawing on that pedal he is
[1:03:53] what was it or does cry now to the dust
[1:03:58] it's a deep calling to a deep queso
[1:04:02] but Brothers in the beginning
[1:04:06] you were in God's mind
[1:04:09] you were a piece of God
[1:04:14] do you believe that
[1:04:16] there was a piece of you brother Bradham
[1:04:19] says we're made of 16 elements
[1:04:23] I I looked it up we're actually made up
[1:04:26] of six elements
[1:04:28] and then the rest it's it's we're needed
[1:04:32] we need it
[1:04:34] but we're made up of six elements
[1:04:37] and those six elements were crying out
[1:04:40] for every single day yes
[1:04:44] we're crying out for calcium
[1:04:47] we're crying now for oxygen for carbon
[1:04:52] all those things were crying out for
[1:04:54] those things
[1:04:56] but if you are the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:05:00] we have a seventh element in here
[1:05:04] we have another element that is crying
[1:05:06] out not for the dust
[1:05:10] it was an element that was before the
[1:05:13] foundation of the world
[1:05:16] it's a predestinated seed in each and
[1:05:19] every one of you
[1:05:21] and the only thing that can satisfy is
[1:05:24] not church
[1:05:26] that's not our church duties
[1:05:29] yeah but it's hearing the word of the
[1:05:32] Lord
[1:05:34] because as much as I go and I eat a
[1:05:36] steak dinner
[1:05:39] I'm eating my my iron I'm eating all
[1:05:42] those things and it helps me is
[1:05:45] brother when I come to church
[1:05:48] I'm waiting to eat on a steak dinner
[1:05:53] and to get those Eternal elements
[1:05:57] so that it can feed the Christ in me
[1:06:02] I'm forming a Christ inside me today
[1:06:06] and the more I eat the more I become
[1:06:09] that Christ
[1:06:12] the more I strengthen myself
[1:06:15] communism that's what church is to me
[1:06:18] today
[1:06:19] every time I sit down I feed on the
[1:06:22] words
[1:06:24] knowing that it's fearing an eternal
[1:06:26] being inside
[1:06:29] a being that you've never seen before
[1:06:33] you see this little white boy
[1:06:36] but this is how I identify myself
[1:06:40] you've never seen me one day of your
[1:06:42] life
[1:06:44] it's me inside here
[1:06:47] and I don't feed on the things of the
[1:06:50] world
[1:06:51] I don't feel on those worldly things
[1:06:54] because it's Darkness
[1:06:57] there's a seed inside of each and every
[1:06:59] person
[1:07:01] there is thirsting for light
[1:07:05] so that it could be pushed out and be
[1:07:07] manifested
[1:07:10] it's thirsting for the true
[1:07:12] unadulterated words
[1:07:15] that's what's going to change us
[1:07:18] that's what's going to help us
[1:07:20] and we're pressed in between that light
[1:07:23] and the Darkness
[1:07:26] brother said that the the seeds were
[1:07:29] already planted on the earth
[1:07:34] when all the darkness was there
[1:07:37] it was seeds
[1:07:40] and brothers sisters that was you yeah
[1:07:44] you were planted somewhere in a
[1:07:47] denomination maybe
[1:07:50] you were planted maybe in the message
[1:07:53] but it when that word that manifested
[1:07:57] light comes to your body
[1:08:00] comes to your soul
[1:08:03] it can't help but to bring forth life
[1:08:07] if there's no light then then you've
[1:08:11] gotta get all all it is going to do is
[1:08:13] gonna manifest that there's nothing
[1:08:15] there
[1:08:17] amen amen we've been in this seven
[1:08:21] Church ages we've been living in
[1:08:25] in the darkness we've been living in the
[1:08:30] night
[1:08:31] brother Branham one one time he he
[1:08:35] revealed
[1:08:37] that every Church age was was signified
[1:08:40] by a moon phase
[1:08:45] and he said that the moon represented
[1:08:48] the church
[1:08:51] and the reflection that it had
[1:08:55] the light that it had meant Christ in
[1:08:58] their days
[1:09:00] the word in their day
[1:09:04] so every single Church age had a portion
[1:09:07] of light or a portion of word in their
[1:09:09] days
[1:09:14] in in Shalom he says
[1:09:17] he says
[1:09:19] isn't it strange
[1:09:21] that just before the pope took his
[1:09:24] journey into Jerusalem
[1:09:28] the moon in the heavens made a total
[1:09:31] blackout
[1:09:34] now this was in 1964.
[1:09:40] when when uh it was never recorded
[1:09:44] never recorded that a pope goes and
[1:09:47] visits uh Israel
[1:09:52] Israel it was actually in January 4th
[1:09:55] 1964.
[1:09:58] he goes and he he goes to to the
[1:10:02] Orthodox Jews
[1:10:05] so that they can create a fellowship
[1:10:09] and brother Abraham says not long after
[1:10:12] that they will come to the Protestants
[1:10:14] and do the same thing
[1:10:19] and brother Berlin said right before
[1:10:21] that
[1:10:23] which was December 30th 1963.
[1:10:29] there was a total blackout of the Moon
[1:10:33] brother said that there was light in
[1:10:37] every Church
[1:10:40] he said did you ever see the paper
[1:10:44] where they took the pictures of the Moon
[1:10:47] he says I have it here if it ain't a
[1:10:51] perfect image
[1:10:54] leaving out the seventh Church age which
[1:10:57] is not yet
[1:11:01] why did he say that
[1:11:03] he said it's not finished yet
[1:11:06] so whenever he wrote The Drew the light
[1:11:10] on the seven churches
[1:11:13] it was still continuing
[1:11:16] so there was light at one time
[1:11:19] but once the pope he went and he created
[1:11:22] fellowship with with Israel
[1:11:27] establishes he said the moon had a total
[1:11:31] blackout
[1:11:33] he said exactly the way I drawed the
[1:11:36] Holy Spirit
[1:11:38] the church ages
[1:11:41] they're the six of them
[1:11:43] the seventh is not finished yet
[1:11:48] the six conditions of the Moon
[1:11:51] how in its brightness in the first
[1:11:54] church age
[1:11:56] the dark in the second third fourth
[1:12:00] fifth and sixth
[1:12:02] just the way the holy spirit let me draw
[1:12:05] them on the board
[1:12:09] then identified himself uh on the wall
[1:12:13] of the Tabernacles
[1:12:16] two years ago
[1:12:19] the moon reflects itself
[1:12:22] and science again picks up the picture
[1:12:26] of the church ages
[1:12:30] just as they picked up the light
[1:12:33] yonderos and put it in life magazines
[1:12:38] in the opening of the seals
[1:12:42] revealing of the uh in the age of the
[1:12:45] seventh angel revelando
[1:12:47] what was it he said he said that was a
[1:12:52] picture
[1:12:53] he said that was a picture of the seven
[1:12:57] churches
[1:12:59] that there was a total blackout
[1:13:04] there was a total blackout whenever that
[1:13:07] happened
[1:13:09] showing the churches completely denied
[1:13:12] Christ
[1:13:14] there was no more light for the seven
[1:13:16] churches
[1:13:20] think about it there's no more light in
[1:13:23] the churches
[1:13:25] we were not waiting for for the churches
[1:13:29] to get bigger and better
[1:13:33] we're waiting for Christ to come back
[1:13:37] we're waiting for the True Light
[1:13:41] the true light to come
[1:13:43] brother Brandon says in Shalom is Shalom
[1:13:47] he said which was that was the church
[1:13:50] the moon represents the Church La Luna
[1:13:53] represented and before the before the
[1:13:56] church
[1:13:57] the shadow of the world crosses the moon
[1:14:02] and the shadow of worldlyism the the
[1:14:06] shadow of worldliness worldly church has
[1:14:08] swept across to black out the entire
[1:14:11] light of the Bible
[1:14:18] the word World got in the light of the
[1:14:22] reflection
[1:14:26] do you understand
[1:14:28] the world crosses the light of the Moon
[1:14:32] and blinded out the sun
[1:14:34] and the reflection of the Moon
[1:14:37] that's supposed to be giving light to
[1:14:40] the Earth it was blacked out foreign
[1:15:20] says that the bride is
[1:15:22] she will be a lady of SIA
[1:15:25] not by no means a lukewarm
[1:15:29] but she'll be on fire for God
[1:15:34] she'll be in the spirit of God
[1:15:37] that's where the bride is
[1:15:40] not in the lady you'll see a church age
[1:15:42] anymore
[1:15:44] she's received
[1:15:55] Paul says yes I want to go depart to be
[1:15:58] with Christ
[1:16:00] but I'd rather stay here
[1:16:03] and be in Christ and whenever you see me
[1:16:07] you see
[1:16:08] Christo brother we're looking for Jesus
[1:16:11] out there
[1:16:12] he's waiting for him out there
[1:16:15] but remember he's not an event
[1:16:19] he says I am the resurrection
[1:16:23] he is here today
[1:16:25] the resurrection and life is here today
[1:16:31] Shalom the light has come
[1:16:33] brother Bradham said good morning
[1:16:36] you don't have to be living in the
[1:16:39] darkness
[1:16:41] it's pushing out the darkness
[1:16:43] we're living in the new days
[1:16:47] we're living in the break of that new
[1:16:50] day
[1:16:52] yes we're waiting for the change of our
[1:16:55] bodies
[1:16:56] but it's the word that changes it
[1:17:00] it's the word every time we feed on that
[1:17:03] word that body is formed inside
[1:17:09] amen amen
[1:17:12] Shalom he says gross Darkness I'm going
[1:17:14] to continue to be reading these messages
[1:17:16] this uh quotes of Shalom well Contin
[1:17:20] but I truly encourage each and every one
[1:17:22] of you to listen to both of those

[1:17:29] it says gross Darkness
[1:17:33] blinding of Israel
[1:17:35] was for the lighting of Gentiles
[1:17:40] so there's always that Junction there's
[1:17:42] always that Darkness and Light coming
[1:17:48] now the blinding of the Gentiles is the
[1:17:50] lighting of Israel
[1:17:54] Israel so so whenever he says it's like
[1:17:59] day and night
[1:18:01] so when one side has got Darkness
[1:18:04] the other side has got light and then
[1:18:08] the light comes over on the other side
[1:18:11] so the moon passing the way it did
[1:18:15] and the reflection of the darkness of
[1:18:18] the world blinding out its light is
[1:18:22] a reflection to us that the Gentile
[1:18:25] Church age is finished
[1:18:32] the
[1:18:33] Gentile Church age is finished
[1:18:37] the church is making herself ready
[1:18:42] making herself ready for a time
[1:18:46] it's time for the Rapture
[1:18:49] for darkness is fading upon the Gentiles
[1:18:52] and Don will soon break upon the Jews
[1:18:58] but then he says he says the church the
[1:19:03] reason I say shalom to them is
[1:19:07] because that is God's peace brother
[1:19:11] there's a lot of things happening
[1:19:14] a lot of unsure things
[1:19:17] we see Banks they're becoming bankrupts
[1:19:23] we see earthquakes we see rumors of war
[1:19:27] in in
[1:19:28] Russia and China
[1:19:31] we see all these things happening
[1:19:34] we see people falling away from the
[1:19:37] Wayside
[1:19:39] but Shalom peace
[1:19:42] don't worry good morning
[1:19:48] the manifested word has come
[1:19:51] don't worry about those things
[1:19:54] the darkness will fade out
[1:19:57] it'll pass away but good morning
[1:20:01] that's what I want to bring to you this
[1:20:04] morning
[1:20:06] for this New Year's
[1:20:08] not looking back but we're looking for
[1:20:11] forward to the breaking of a new day
[1:20:15] until there is something great laying
[1:20:18] ahead of us
[1:20:21] where the years has been the joy that
[1:20:24] we've been looking forward to the
[1:20:25] pressing
[1:20:30] the coming of the great light
[1:20:34] and now we can see a breaking over the
[1:20:38] horizontal horizontal Realms
[1:20:43] it's breaking between Mortal and
[1:20:45] immortality
[1:20:49] we see a breaking between heavens and
[1:20:52] earth
[1:20:55] from an earth-bound sickness and a
[1:20:57] troubled world
[1:21:01] [Music]
[1:21:03] into a bright and Shining day of
[1:21:06] Immortal Life
[1:21:15] that shall never pass away
[1:21:18] it's shalom unto the church
[1:21:22] now it's like time coming for the
[1:21:26] Believers
[1:21:28] but grows Darkness for the people
[1:21:32] brother Branham said how could there be
[1:21:35] dark
[1:21:35] in life
[1:21:38] he said it's got to be separated
[1:21:41] there has to be a separation
[1:21:45] and the only thing that separates it
[1:21:49] is the word manifested
[1:21:53] that's what separates life from Darkness
[1:21:57] you've got issues in your body
[1:22:08] you've got you've got things that you
[1:22:10] can't let go of it
[1:22:13] the word manifested will separate the
[1:22:16] life
[1:22:19] hey he's doing it today he's doing it in
[1:22:22] the world he's pressing the darkness out
[1:22:25] is
[1:22:28] amen
[1:22:31] let's see um
[1:22:33] he says and the only thing that
[1:22:36] separates is the word manifested
[1:22:39] separates it presses it to the other
[1:22:42] side
[1:22:44] here's the darkness on the Earth
[1:22:46] but when the manifested word of God
[1:22:52] which is spoken into existence by the
[1:22:55] word
[1:22:56] when it shows itself Darkness runs on
[1:23:00] the other side
[1:23:02] so what is life
[1:23:05] it's the Vindicated spoken word of God
[1:23:08] brother Branham
[1:23:11] you can't light the Earth with
[1:23:14] flashlights
[1:23:17] it takes the word that's manifested the
[1:23:20] sun
[1:23:24] many many years
[1:23:26] they said Emmanuel's coming
[1:23:30] here comes God With Us
[1:23:33] so here comes here comes the the Son of
[1:23:36] God
[1:23:38] but when Jesus came in his day
[1:23:41] they rejected him why because there was
[1:23:45] no light in them
[1:23:47] there was no seed there was no
[1:23:50] germanized seed to to take a hold of
[1:23:53] that life
[1:23:55] so it darkened the Pharisees
[1:24:00] it's the light that presses the darkness
[1:24:02] remember that
[1:24:05] the more the light comes
[1:24:08] the darker it becomes
[1:24:11] pressing that darkness
[1:24:14] and it will be darkest before they
[1:24:17] finally breaks tonight
[1:24:23] now in closing
[1:24:26] now we've heard the story of of the
[1:24:29] Samaritan woman many times how
[1:24:33] how she was an ill-famed woman
[1:24:36] she was
[1:24:39] person
[1:24:40] a
[1:24:45] and Jesus he was walking with his
[1:24:48] disciples they were journeying around
[1:24:52] and in the Scripture it says I need to
[1:24:55] go to Samira
[1:24:57] um
[1:24:59] he said I need to go there
[1:25:02] he didn't go for any other reason just
[1:25:05] for that woman
[1:25:08] and when he went there
[1:25:11] he sat there in the well
[1:25:13] she went over there and she started to
[1:25:15] draw her water out
[1:25:19] and he said get me some water he said
[1:25:22] and when she saw him
[1:25:24] all she saw was a Jew
[1:25:27] all she saw was race
[1:25:31] I'm a Samaritan you're a Jewish
[1:25:34] we don't have no dealings with you guys
[1:25:40] he said and he began to reveal the word
[1:25:43] more and more and more to her
[1:25:47] and and then she realized so she said oh
[1:25:52] you're you're a prophet oh it is
[1:25:54] whenever the word is being revealed more
[1:25:59] what happens is is you see Christ more
[1:26:03] okay
[1:26:05] first first you just might see a message
[1:26:09] you might see a white man with no hair
[1:26:13] americanos
[1:26:17] that sounds like a hillbilly
[1:26:20] but when you continue to hear that word
[1:26:25] you say ah he's a prophet he said
[1:26:29] wow look at what he's doing
[1:26:32] but if you continue to listen to that
[1:26:35] voice
[1:26:37] and go beyond that man
[1:26:57] and and then finally Jesus says unto her
[1:27:00] and um
[1:27:02] verse 21 of of chapter 4.
[1:27:09] he says Jesus said unto her
[1:27:12] woman believe me
[1:27:15] the hour cometh
[1:27:18] when ye shall neither in this mountain
[1:27:21] nor yet in Jerusalem worship the father
[1:27:25] Jerusalem
[1:27:26] now here comes the word manifested
[1:27:30] here's this woman that her whole body is
[1:27:34] defiled the Bible says
[1:27:39] she's no good no yeah
[1:27:41] but here's the word
[1:27:44] manifesto he went to the Pharisees
[1:27:49] he went to the priest they denied him
[1:27:53] but then here comes the word manifested
[1:27:55] to this woman
[1:27:58] and he says the hour cometh when you
[1:28:02] don't have to Worship in Jerusalem or
[1:28:04] the mountain or wherever
[1:28:08] he says ye worship ye know what not what
[1:28:14] we know what we worship for salvation is
[1:28:17] of the Jews
[1:28:21] now she didn't know she was in a
[1:28:24] junction or oppressing in between
[1:28:28] she didn't know that there was going to
[1:28:30] be a changing in her life
[1:28:33] she just heard him say there's going to
[1:28:36] be a time
[1:28:38] in the future
[1:28:41] but then in verse 23 he says
[1:28:45] he said but the hour cometh and now is
[1:28:51] when true worshipers shall worship the
[1:28:54] father and in spirit and in truth
[1:28:59] for the father seeketh such to worship
[1:29:02] she's
[1:30:04] and she grabbed the word for her days
[1:30:08] why she was looking ahead foreign
[1:31:58] he couldn't even he he bowed down and
[1:32:01] began to worship
[1:32:04] and then God said you can't even see my
[1:32:07] face you can't see my full Glory yes
[1:32:11] but whenever he came down the mountain
[1:32:15] what happened to him
[1:32:17] that same Glory he beheld yes
[1:32:21] it's the same Glory that was on him
[1:32:24] and when the people saw him they said
[1:32:28] Moses you've got to Avail yourself now
[1:32:31] why because the glory was on him
[1:32:35] but the glory is his word La glorious
[1:32:38] and he's not hiding his face from us
[1:32:43] it's his full word
[1:32:46] and when you see his glory
[1:32:49] you become his glory
[1:32:51] the Bible it says
[1:32:54] the Bible says when we beheld him
[1:32:59] when we see him
[1:33:02] he shall be like him
[1:33:05] think about it when you see him you'll
[1:33:08] be like him
[1:33:10] every day if you're reading your Bible
[1:33:12] and your message
[1:33:15] you're looking at him he's here today
[1:33:19] but he doesn't want to dwell in a Bible
[1:33:23] he doesn't want to dwell in the message
[1:33:26] he wants he wants the word manifested in
[1:33:30] you
[1:33:32] he wants the word walking and talking
[1:33:36] that's each and every one of you yes
[1:33:42] Heavenly Father
[1:33:44] Lord I ask that the word penetrate the
[1:33:48] soul fathers
[1:33:50] Lord it goes beyond feelings
[1:33:54] it goes beyond Jill's father
[1:33:57] Lord let it hit the predestinated seeds
[1:34:16] Lord they will be formed into the living
[1:34:19] image of the Living God okay

[1:34:26] they just heard from their theophanese

[1:34:32] give you all the honor and the praise
[1:34:36] Lord we know you're doing something
