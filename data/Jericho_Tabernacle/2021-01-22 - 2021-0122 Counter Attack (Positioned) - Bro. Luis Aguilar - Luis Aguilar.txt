lord in this evening we ask it all in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen may the lord bless each and every single one of you this evening i i hope that all of you are doing well especially that um all of you are happy to be in the house of the lord and those who are watching online for the internet may the lord bless each and every single one of you if we can open our bibles to the second chronicles the 20th chapter the 17th verse amen and it says like this this scene second chronicles 2017. ye shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand ye still and see the salvation of the lord be with you o judah and jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the lord will be with you amen may the lord add the blessing of his word may you take your seats you know before i begin um i'd like to i'd like to to thank sister lupita alvarado johnny's ties una de las corbatas de elle manojani and um instead of letting me borrow one embezz she gave me one and so this this this is a tie that i i have on right now and when she brought up all the ties you know it was a bunch of ties and um i would look for the one that really looked like or typified by the johnny johnny well johnny had a lot of ties but it looked like he always wore the same ones so i wanted that one that that looked like him so hopefully this thai will give me the anointment your brother johnny was very long-winded i might preach so i'm going to say that that's the same this evening so i'd like to thank the family um um this evening i'd like to continue on our subject that we have continued and uh the reason why we got this message is because we're about demonology and we're counter-attacking that yes and brother brown says we we hear a lot about demons but you hardly so the last time we were here we spoke about character ultimate character to have our character to be like christ and um in this in this evening and here's a quote from brother branham and the message 1955. extracted the position of a believer in christ now it says now with the help of god this afternoon holy scriptures if let's try to place the believer positionally in christ now he did not say let's try to place the believer positionally is it what excuse me what and show what his authority is in christ then everybody out there will be praying for the sick and we'll have a great meeting i'm see it says and he will show us the authority that we have in christ on our base scripture on second chronicles the beginning of the chapter it begins to talk about jehoshaphat and we find jehoshaphat in the corner here is ahab was a lukewarm believer a cabernet the one who was married to jezebel and they were going to go into war with some different nations the battle of raymond gilead and so joseph began to tell ahab where's your prophets so we can see we should go up there and although all of ahab's prophet said where you you're going to get it don't you have one more out there somewhere and you can find that on the 18th chapter of second chronicles he says yeah i got one he says his name is micah the son of imla i hate him for he never prophesied good on to me they go on to war and ahab dies and so here jehoshaphat is there and this and and we find on the 13th verse on chapter 20. us as long as we can stick together we we stay in our positions then the spirit of the lord can speak and don't and it says thus saith the lord unto you it says be not afraid not for the battle is not yours so i want you to notice what the spirit of the lord told him what to do and i'm going to jump to the 17th verse that was our base scripture and it says ye shall not need to fight in this battle you imagine that imagine the lord or the general tells you you don't have to fight this battle this is the only thing you got to do you're not going to fight this is the only thing you got to do set yourselves and stand ye still now set yourselves stay in your position stand still and you will see the salvation of the lord be with you many times we want to go and fight and go and fight this we want to physically sometimes even go fight physically you know where we're still christians we want to go fight it physically stand in your position when i say church i mean all of them and they don't know who they are they're not having a son i'm gonna repeat that one more time find two classes of people encounter those different classes i find fundamental people enjoy fundamental who positionally know their position in christ is that's got that's got a lot of money in the bank and can't write a check and the other one can write a check and ain't got no money in the bank if you could get two of them together if you could get two of them together if you could get the faith that's in the pentecostal fundamental people pentecostal did you understand what i just said he says it says if we can get both of them together it's like a man who has a lot of money in the bank but he can't write a check but that's why every single time that we should come to the service of the lord that we have the truth you're blind because you want to be blind you don't want to be in your possession you know your position but you don't want to be in your position it says if we can know our positions when we can have authority with character then we can reign now i want you to notice something we're speaking about position not our position in the church no la position you have to know who you are sometimes we ask the people or the young people do you know who you are and a lot of people go around i don't know who i am who am i who am i they're going around circles and circles in circles i don't know who i am but you're a son and you're a daughter of god it's very easy to say that you see this but the hard thing is to accept that you're a son and a daughter of god and why is it hard to accept something like that because you see a long list of mistakes you see a long list of all the mistakes that you have done you say how can i be a son of god can i be a daughter of god that's exactly you're because can you imagine the criticism that joshua got imagined you're not a prophet you're not moses how dare you stand behind that pupil never did that voice renegades of israel see moses did that you did it you imagine the pressure is the la president and the lord told them cross over jordan in three days and the paulie the brother garcia says probably the engineers in those times joshua you're not moses god won't answer you you're not a prophet i'm going to open up the sea for you i am a warrior trying to get you out cancer leave in the name of the lord jesus christ what you can do you can be in your position that's what the devil says [Music] those evangelists is you are kennedys you think the devil's going to come out because you believe what brother branham is you think the devil's going to come out because you believe who brother johnny and brother garcia is [Music] they are in the name of christ who paul preaches get out of here who are you yeah and the devil said who kin eddie i know who christ is i know who paul is he knows who he is do you know who you are it doesn't matter how small your position is your position could be so small but you can do more pero you know see the devil really wanted to get job out of his position the devil said lord i'm out of his position one disaster after [Music] and it seems like it's getting darker and darker and darker probably probably the devil part when he took away his kids he said okay i'm just waiting he was probably waiting around the corner i'm waiting for him to curse god have you ever cursed god before good and there was joe guest of a home one after another one after another his own wife said won't you just die and curse your [Music] probably felt like he wanted to give up i'm not gonna lie one of us sometimes we feel like giving up the greatest pastor stranger i'm an alien in their sights i call my servant and he gives me no answer i call my friends amigos they have left me immediately young children despise me i arose and they speak against me all my inward friends have hurt me and whom i loved are turned sometimes you have to separate from everything that's there on earth i'm sure you can read between the lines what i'm saying is the very dearest person on earth you have to shake hands with them and take your position in christ to where god has called you see but what is god doing transforming you from what you was transforming he's transforming you testa maybe a daughter a son or by the renewing our it was the son of god that had to die for us things of value of great price to bring this message you can find that and message the power of transformation 1965. transformation says you have to separate from everything that's there on earth to take your position to what god has called you to para position every everyone left job his workers family his friends amigos everyone abandoned him because we don't believe in divisions corruption one more i'm decent amount of brandon sister go in peace el mana buy in pasta go in peace i had her i had her testimony not not too long ago i don't know who the sister is i don't know who she is but somebody told me now you might say well brother somebody told you yeah somebody told me about the gospel of the lord jesus christ that's the way it is yes yes and he says she said to me yeah yeah maybe he said brother this sister had a cancer problem and she went to brother johnny johnny and he said brother john you have cancer will you pray for me sister do you have a problem obien but the other person didn't received her persona she didn't accept it no no she came back to brother johnny johnny he said brother johnny i did what you told me to do go make repent in the name of the lord jesus christ forgive them and now i'm telling you in the name of the lord jesus christ vision that happened everybody's going to leave you one of these days but only will and that old rich ruler was in hell yes he had an opportunity to follow the lord jesus christ he said lord how can i inherit eternal life he said i have kept it's good good to preach a message but can you leave me a message and we find them along the road that's the decision that he made tomorrow but he rejected the word made flesh now he was standing in hell he told abraham abraham abraham can you send someone from here that's nothing for me to know but the only thing is my job has to tell you if you have a problem with someone if you didn't understand anything doesn't matter what happens no important doesn't matter how many storms may come no matter how hard it rains it doesn't matter who comes and goes i know my redeemer though this body may see corruption oh these worms may eat this flesh he's and that's the most important thing is the most important is that god loves you but do you love him you love yourself he's forgiving you can you forgive yourself to keep going forward heavenly father father celestial in this evening lord lord your bit you've been so good to us lord i know you're the same yesterday and forever and father i know who i am yo that's why i can come to you with confidence [Music] i know there's a lot of good things that we haven't done but father father help us lord to
