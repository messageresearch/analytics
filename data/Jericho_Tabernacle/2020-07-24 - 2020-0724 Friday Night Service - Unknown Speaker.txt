interpreter the lord may you bless us in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen may the lord uh bless you this evening is it's truly nice to be in the house of the lord you know we might not have a big physical audience you know i'm not sure if i heard it from brother branham or for someone else no cece the angels that are taking in the pews and they're they're witnessing what we're talking about is trust that he always has towards myself to always stand behind his pulpit and to speak to the flock and to the to the youth i think it's even more uh scarier i guess when it comes down to the youth because you can't go too hard hospital and you can't be too easy you got to find yourself right down the middle somewhere so i i i thank brother alvarado that he sees that enemy to do that juanito quebeco i'm going to open up our scriptures to the book of saint matthew it's uh it's found on the sixth chapter verse 30 i'm going i would like to to continue of what we spoke about approximately about a month ago approximately it's too much it's too wide to bring it to one or two messages and i always see that the lord compares the kingdom several times jesus says where can i like onto the kingdom jesus here he says the kingdom is like on two they say uh el reyno es como and then he says and then another scripture says the kingdom is like on too dice el reyno escomo so it's very wide it says stencil and uh last time we spoke about putting seeking first the kingdom ultimately 30th verse says wherefore if god so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you o ye of little faith therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall what shall we eat or what shall we drink or what shall we be clothed for after all these things that the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that he have need of all these things but seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added on to you amen may the lord add blessings to his word and i want to say it to the invisible audience that i hope you're all doing well we trust in the lord that this too shall pass but uh i think the lord watches over us uh my base scripture me uh that i would like to kind of focus on tonight it's going to be found in saint john it's encountered in juan the third chapter el capitolo and uh i will start reading or i'll start making emphasis on the first verse to continue what we spoke about a month ago i like to entitle it as understanding how to enter intending here on the saint john the third chapter in san juan el capitolo we find a pharisee a queen controversial by the name of nicodemus nicodemus and he was a ruler of the jews and he came onto jesus by nighttime what i like to do i like to focus every little word that the scripture says he didn't come to jesus during that the day el no jesus durante uh he didn't want to be seen he didn't want to be seen from uh for all the pharisees to see that he was talking to jesus so therefore this pharisee nicodemus is quickly right off the bat the first word he tells jesus he gave him respect and he says we know that thou art a teacher come from god he didn't say i nicodemus he says no we all so then jesus directs himself to him respond jesus he says except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god he finds himself kind of tangled to what jesus just said time except the man be born again except he didn't understand what jesus just said jesus so then on the fifth verse we find that jesus breaks it down just a little bit more jesus he says accept a man he says be born of water nazca del agua and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom nicodemus being a pharisee didn't understand nicodemus so then jesus broke it down just a bit more for him and jesus he says accept a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter in the kingdom of god to me i me myself i see five things i see born again i see now in order for someone to be born spiritually in order for there to be a new birth i see that we need three elements we need to be justified we need to be sanctified and we need the holy spirit we need these three things to see the kingdom to enter [Music] and here i start to study i say how can it be that a man can be born of water so if we go to romans the sixth chapter vamos a here is the apostle paul speaking to the romans he says know he not that so many of us as were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also shall walk in the newness of life now before we can be born again the first thing we need to do is to repent the apostle peter says in acts 238 he says repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ so now jesus says except the man be born of water jesus so we went to romans chapter 6 chapter 3 and 4. he says therefore we are buried with him junta mente you don't have someone's toes sticking up out of the ground um or you go walking in the graveyard in the cemetery and you see the dead man with his hand sticking up out of the grave that's why when the minister is baptizing the repentant sinner he has to make sure that all of his bodies by baptism oh in the name of the lord jesus christ the minister has to make sure that his body is covered because the pastor says that's why jesus says accept a man be born i love how the word just it it points jesus everywhere jesus you might say brother the new birth again and speak about the new birth from genesis all the way to revelation in the genesis has so now we understand what jesus said because the holy spirit through the apostle paul on the letter to the romans he says we are buried that's why every inch of that repentant sinner's body has to be covered in water i remember i asked brother oh she wants to read the bible she wants to read she wants to listen to the tapes i said that's amazing that's how it is with every repented sinner and it is naturally yeah you're in the hot what happens we get dirty again oh i just love the word i mean oh yeah we could take a nice cold shower being outside in the hot heat of arizona and that's the error of the new convert yes i'm clean oh lord i love the word now let's go to first peter de pedro first peter the third chapter uh the 20th verse here's the apostle peter now talking apostle pedro he says which sometimes we're disobedient when once the long suffering of god waited in the days of noah while the ark was preparing wearing few that is eight souls were saved by water enough so what is the path to peter saying pedro he says that is eight souls figure we're on to even baptism also now save us by the resurrection of jesus christ he says just like it saved noah salvo the baptism also saves us el bautism [Applause] it says we are buried with him but we resurrected new life and just like it saved noah it saves me but i like the scripture i kind of see it like this the apostle peter says we're on to even the baptism also now saves us correspond then jesus says in saint john 3 5. jesus juan tres cinco except the man be born of water and this is the agua e there's where we fell i is on the field because we want to stay in the shadow of the cross permanently get on the cross and be crucified why we need to go to saint matthew the third chapter that's what brother branham says you grab a little pig you can have the best soap out there you can even have one of those water compressors to wash the 18 wheelers and you can start calling him cute little names oh louise you're so beautiful you look you're a little clean now all right vestan lindo you see how i gave it a name becomes oh luis you look so clean now oh luis aura tv you could put a rope on them you could put them on a cage but the moment you let him go for a moment he's gonna run through the first pile of mud the full pile of dirt he sees that's what apostle peter says it does not take away the filth of the flesh foreign see i read saint john three li san juan first peter three primarily saint matthew 3. perfection here's the here's john the baptist who was the elijah of that time he said i indeed baptize you with water in agua onto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i he was the prophet shall baptize you with the holy ghost and espirito santo and with fire if fuego except the man be born of water the agua acts 238 2 38. and of spirits be baptized and receive the gift of the holy ghost that's why john said i baptize you with fire with water he's talking about the lord habla del signora the lord jesus christ of christ the word ghost and spirit are similar aura holy ghost and with fire it is fuego that is what's going to take away the filth of the flesh of the spirit evil spirit now notice born of the water and born of the spirit and john said baptized in water juan joe alberta i love wow that's a mouthful now the way i see it i can't come into it uh brother johnny's house my boots full of mud imagine me coming with my boots full of mud and i come in with a shirt full of sweat and i i got a bunch of dirt everywhere and i want to sit on the couch well perhaps maybe brother johnny won't say anything he says before we enter how much more clean do we have to be cuanto mas limpios de vemoser to enter a kingdom and what about god's kingdom [Music] oh wow don't you love the word i love the word i mean that's beautiful we have to be clean from all of the filthiness that we have oh hallelujah i'm gonna read a little quote here for brother branham jehovah gyra what if a pig wanted to be a lamb cordero it wouldn't do him knowing any good no no he's just a pig solo his nature is a pig it's the same thing well i believe i will become a christian christian you couldn't do it if you wanted to us god has to do it the mentality that i might have la mentality i helped to to fix jericho tabernacle i was there with the buffer established trying don't you just love how everything ties with itself what did brother branham say in order for there to be a natural birth i need water we need blood sangria and we need spirit espiritu in order for there to be a spiritual birth to be born again we need water we need blood sangria and we need the holy spirit is the only way that god can do anything with you to be changed from sin or to a christian christian plunge beneath the fountain filled with blood don't just dip your toes in the blood put my hand in the blood oh lord they have mercy on me recorded me and comes out you come out something besides a sinner something besides the pig with the with the bow tie [Music] hallelujah now we understand how to be born again all right we just talked about it but brother branham says that's why my title this evening understanding how to enter es we spoke about how to enter but the hardest thing for someone how this prophet could be telling a a woman's issue a prophet but now i want to zero in just a little bit more on understanding intending kingdom but he gives the answer but he that do with the will of my father then i find in matthew 12. encuentro in matteo dossey on the 47th first to the 50th they told jesus jesus there's your mother to mother there's your brother that's for whosoever shall do the will of my father which is in heaven is my brother and jesus says whosoever doeth the will of my father jesus now here's two things and my father now not my carnal father i know my father carnal biological but my spiritual father is father spiritual jesus christ jesus christ he said oh rather god jesus saying the will of my father i'm going to zero in just a little bit more concentrate sometimes we don't understand why god does things to us [Music] but that's why jesus says except the man be born again he cannot understand the kingdom el reyno and that's his will yes you got to be born again you gotta be born again [Music] sometimes i want that my for my brother or i don't have any kids but sometimes but i am a son sometimes the parents want the kids to do their will and they don't allow their kids to do their father's will we want to say no i don't want you doing this and the only way that god can speak to us today of course through his tapes of course through his holy spirit uh claro por medio del sol espiritu when the pastor says i want you to come and help me i don't want you to go with them holy rollers i want you to do my will i don't want you to do the heavenly father's will what happens when because when we're doing god's what if that's god's perfect not they don't again especially if you understand why god did the other son because you're not born again in order for us to understand we must be born again is things oh things i sacrificed my son my daughter sacrifico i sacrificed the youth of the church sacrifico la juventude de la glacia for god because i love god i sacrificed my economy sacrifice finances because i understand [Music] [Music] to death resurrecting a new life and baptized are born in the spirit that warns away all the filth then [Music] oh lord we love you so much [Music] [Music] [Music] the youth that are in this [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] how great is el reyno de
