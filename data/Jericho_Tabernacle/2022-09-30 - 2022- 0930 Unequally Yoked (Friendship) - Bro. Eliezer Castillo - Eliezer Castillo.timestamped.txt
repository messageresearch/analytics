[33:15] Holy Spirit to come down
[33:20] amen I agree each and every one of you
[33:22] in the precious name of our Lord Jesus
[33:24] Christ
[33:26] it's so good to be here and just to
[33:29] fellowship with each and every one of
[33:31] you
[33:35] I would like to go straight to the
[33:37] scriptures
[33:40] if you would like to turn with me to
[33:43] Second Corinthians 6 14.
[33:49] whenever you have it just go ahead and
[33:51] say Amen
[33:53] second Corinthians 6 14.
[34:03] and it says
[34:06] be not unequally yoked together with
[34:10] unbelievers for what Fellowship has
[34:14] righteousness with unrighteousness and
[34:17] what communion has light with Darkness
[34:29] let's go to 15 it says and what Concord
[34:34] has Christ with Belial or what part has
[34:38] he that believes with an
[34:41] infidelberg okay
[34:52] heavenly father father Celestial Lord we
[34:56] have just read your holy word father
[34:58] father
[35:00] Lord it is blessed father we are the
[35:04] ones that need your blessings this
[35:06] evening Lord yes
[35:11] I asked Lord that your Holy Spirit come
[35:14] down father and speak to us whatever we
[35:17] need Lord
[35:23] Lord take our own thoughts out of the
[35:25] way father and open each and every heart

[35:36] to be expecting your word father God
[35:42] lord we give it all to you Lord
[35:46] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[35:49] pray
[35:51] amen and amen amen man amen you may be
[35:54] seated
[35:58] so my title this evening is unequally
[36:01] yoked
[36:05] and if I had a subtitle it would be just
[36:08] called friends
[36:12] I I really have a strong conviction
[36:17] about these Services here on Fridays
[36:23] and I'm sure all of the our brothers do
[36:26] all of us do
[36:29] that it should be guided and directed to
[36:33] the youth is
[36:36] because they are
[36:39] um the future they're the the Christians
[36:41] of tomorrow
[36:44] once once all of the Old Timers and the
[36:49] Old Faithful people pass away
[36:54] who's here to pick up the word
[36:58] it's going to be the young people
[37:01] they're going to need their own
[37:02] experience
[37:05] and I believe that the young people God
[37:08] has put something uh or or has prepared
[37:12] something for you greater than
[37:14] in any age
[37:19] [Music]
[37:21] because you guys are living in the
[37:23] hardest stage
[37:27] this day is even harder than it was 10
[37:30] years ago
[37:35] when you guys go to school when you guys
[37:37] go to work wherever you guys are at
[37:39] school
[37:42] the influences of the world are stronger
[37:45] than it they've ever happened
[37:50] but the word never changes
[37:53] the word never fails
[37:57] and no matter how great say in uh
[38:01] fortifies his army
[38:06] no matter how great the sin is in the
[38:09] world
[38:11] the word stays the same
[38:14] and you have to remember that God loves
[38:17] each and every one of you
[38:21] and he has your best interests
[38:25] he wants the best for each and every
[38:28] young person this evening
[38:31] so I just want to speak about unequally
[38:34] yoked
[38:37] now I don't know if anybody knows but
[38:40] the Yoke what he's talking about
[38:46] but he's making an example of oxen
[38:51] plowing a field Elizabeth
[38:56] what they would do is they would have
[38:58] two pairs of oxen yeah
[39:03] and what they would do is they would put
[39:05] this thing that would connect both of
[39:07] them together
[39:11] and it would allow them to plow the
[39:13] field together
[39:18] and the reason they needed two is so
[39:21] that they can have more power so that
[39:22] they can guide one another
[39:24] is
[39:29] and that little piece was called the
[39:31] Yoke yes
[39:34] in Deuteronomy 22 10 it says
[39:39] it says you shall not plow with an ox
[39:42] and a donkey yoke together they said no
[39:45] Aras
[39:48] that sounds that sounds pretty funny
[39:51] he said you know what if you want a
[39:53] plowfield don't get a dunking an ox to
[39:56] plow it is
[40:02] you have a donkey that has shorter legs
[40:07] it's more temperamental is
[40:14] and it eats differently than the ox
[40:18] the the the donkey he what he does is he
[40:23] eats
[40:24] um really coarse weeds that are
[40:26] poisonous to the ox
[40:28] is
[40:34] so that yoke was unequal
[40:38] it didn't work for the ox and the uh the
[40:42] donkey
[40:45] and also they realized that the donkey
[40:48] was an unclean animal in the laws of of
[40:51] uh of Israel
[40:54] [Music]
[40:58] so the the donkey was unclean and the ox
[41:01] was a clean
[41:03] animals
[41:06] and he said he did not want them to be
[41:09] yoked together uh
[41:14] one now Paul is using that same
[41:16] reference
[41:18] and says do not be unequally yoked with
[41:23] unbelievers
[41:26] if you have a desire to serve the Lord
[41:29] this evening
[41:32] if that is your sole purpose to serve
[41:36] the Lord
[41:39] how can you be equally yoked with
[41:43] somebody that wants to serve the world
[41:49] they don't have the same goal as you
[41:52] know
[41:54] they don't have the same desires as you
[41:57] classes
[41:58] so as the young man and the young ladies
[42:01] they begin to find people that they they
[42:04] like
[42:09] the best thing to do is see what your
[42:12] goals are
[42:14] foreign
[42:24] maybe I want to be a doctor
[42:27] maybe I want to do this and I want to
[42:29] have my own house
[42:32] maybe I want to serve the Lord with all
[42:35] of my heart
[42:38] maybe for the young man I want to be a a
[42:41] preacher I want to be a deacon I want to
[42:43] help out in church
[42:48] I want to be a godly man that that
[42:51] serves the Lord with all of his heart
[42:56] will that young lady have the same goals
[42:59] as you
[43:02] classes
[43:03] will that young man have the same goals
[43:06] as you young ladies
[43:11] because because whenever you pick not
[43:15] only friends but whatever you pick a
[43:17] partner
[43:19] is
[43:23] now I'm gonna
[43:25] get back on my message but I do want to
[43:27] say this
[43:30] that brother Brandon says that outside
[43:33] of Salvation
[43:36] a Godly woman
[43:39] is the greatest thing that can ever
[43:42] happen to a man
[43:45] outside of Salvation
[43:48] that is pretty amazing
[43:52] that that the greatest thing in the
[43:56] whole entire world
[43:58] is to pick a Godly woman
[44:02] now that's always in the perspective of
[44:05] brother Branham
[44:09] because he's a man but look at in your
[44:12] your the young lady's perspective
[44:17] if you're a young lady that is serving
[44:19] the Lord with all of your hearts
[44:24] you are the great
[44:33] so so whenever a young man and a young
[44:36] lady they pick or they choose
[44:39] um whoever is going to be their partner
[44:42] is
[44:45] going to be their husband or their wife
[44:50] that is an eternal decision
[44:54] see we make decisions in our whole life
[44:59] Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts Starbucks or
[45:03] Dunkin Donuts do I want to go to this
[45:05] mall or do I want to go to that one
[45:08] do I want this job or do I want this
[45:11] career
[45:13] do I want to do this do I want to do
[45:15] that
[45:17] but there is an eternal decision
[45:21] and the first and most great or the
[45:24] greatest decision is
[45:28] is do I want to serve the Lord with all
[45:31] of my heart
[45:33] that is an eternal decision
[45:38] and when you make that decision
[45:42] it doesn't matter what condition you're
[45:44] in the classes
[45:47] it doesn't matter where you find
[45:49] yourself
[45:51] it doesn't matter where you're at
[45:53] mentally or spiritually
[45:57] make that decision once
[46:01] and that decision becomes an eternal
[46:04] decision
[46:07] that changes the course of your life
[46:12] maybe you'll go through your ups and
[46:14] downs
[46:17] but it'll change your Eternal course and
[46:20] your Eternal goal
[46:24] eterno is
[46:25] and your second greatest decision is
[46:29] picking the person who you're going to
[46:30] spend the rest of your life with Jesus
[46:37] because if you're a Christian
[46:40] a Christian is attracted to eternal life
[46:46] a Christian's not going to be attracted
[46:48] to the things of the world
[46:52] a young man or a young lady is not going
[46:55] to be attracted to the Fashions or how
[46:58] the world
[47:00] raises the young people now
[47:08] but if you've made your decision to
[47:11] serve the Lord with all of your heart
[47:12] then
[47:17] eternity is going to be attracted to
[47:18] Eternity
[47:21] and what you're looking for inside of a
[47:24] person
[47:37] with Christians that serve the Lord and
[47:40] they find somebody that is serving the
[47:42] lord and is filled with the Holy ghosts
[47:48] you have been bound eternally
[47:52] and you'll be bound
[47:56] even up be uh outside of death amen
[48:02] well that's the same thing with picking
[48:05] friends
[48:07] brother Brandon would always say this
[48:10] the quote of show me your friends and
[48:12] I'll tell you who you are
[48:15] [Music]
[48:18] we have to watch out what kind of
[48:21] friends we hang around
[48:24] because because no matter how good a
[48:28] person is
[48:31] there's things that are trying to pull
[48:34] you to the things of the world
[48:38] if you'd like to turn with me to
[48:41] Revelations 2 18.
[48:47] and if my time is up I would uh love if
[48:51] one of the brothers would just let me
[48:52] know this is
[48:56] [Music]
[48:58] Revelations 2 18
[49:01] now who loves the Lord
[49:05] who wants to serve him every single day
[49:08] who wants to get better and closer to
[49:11] the Lord
[49:13] amen I do too I don't want to be worse
[49:18] than I was yesterday
[49:21] I want to be better and better and
[49:23] better
[49:28] so Revelations 2 18.
[49:32] now this is the Bible says and unto the
[49:36] angel of the church the criteria right
[49:40] these things say the Son of God whose
[49:43] eyes
[49:44] like unto a flame of fire and his feet
[49:47] are like fine brass yes
[49:57] wow his eyes are like a flame of fire
[50:03] so right when he says
[50:07] the Son of God with eyes of a flame of
[50:10] fire
[50:13] then he says I know your works
[50:20] oh man that will run chills behind your
[50:23] back if God ever told you that is
[50:31] a fire and he knows your works
[50:35] but look at what he tells them
[50:39] I know your works and charity and
[50:43] service and faith and thy patience and
[50:47] thy works
[50:49] and and thy works and the last to be
[50:52] better than the first
[50:56] is
[51:02] man I would love for the Lord to tell me
[51:04] that
[51:07] I know I know what you've been doing
[51:11] I know your works
[51:14] I know you're trying
[51:17] I know your faith
[51:20] I see your love
[51:22] I see your service
[51:25] and I know that your works
[51:28] are better than they were when you first
[51:31] started
[51:34] so this is a people that are progressing
[51:37] with the Lord
[51:41] this is the people that the Lord the
[51:44] lord loves
[51:47] he's telling them him that that they
[51:50] they are progressing to be more abundant
[51:54] than they were yesterday
[52:00] now now we know that he's talking to
[52:03] Christians here
[52:06] these people love the Lord
[52:09] see he's not talking to them like he
[52:12] talked to the lady of sins
[52:18] remember when he talked to the lady of
[52:20] CN age
[52:23] they were neither hot nor cold
[52:27] they were lukewarm and he would spew
[52:29] them out of his mouth
[52:33] they were full of sin and they didn't
[52:35] even know it
[52:39] these people he said no you guys have
[52:42] full of love you guys have full of faith
[52:44] and service
[52:48] face then you know the service
[52:51] but listen what he says
[52:54] I love how how beautiful his words are
[52:58] to his people
[53:02] even before he's about to utter words of
[53:06] blame
[53:10] words of judgment
[53:13] warning
[53:14] first he wants to let them know don't
[53:17] worry I see what you guys are doing I
[53:19] see your love I see your patience
[53:25] now Revelations 2 20 it says
[53:31] notwithstanding I have a few things
[53:33] against you because thou sufferest that
[53:37] woman Jezebel that calleth herself a
[53:39] prophetess to teach and to seduce my
[53:42] servants to commit fornication and to
[53:45] eat things sacrificed to idols
[54:15] not that you did something horrendous
[54:19] not that not that uh
[54:22] we're doing where we backslid from God
[54:27] you know we we uh fall short every
[54:31] single day but if you have your goal in
[54:34] the Lord the Lord Jesus Christ will
[54:37] protect you and his blood will be there
[54:38] with you
[54:46] he said no I see your Works they're good
[54:52] but the one thing I have against you
[54:57] he said that you sufferest
[55:01] you tolerate
[55:05] you tolerate tolerate means to allow to
[55:08] be or to be done without
[55:10] prohibition hindrance or contradiction
[55:19] [Music]
[55:22] to put up with
[55:25] not that you're indulging in sin
[55:28] complaces not that you're out there with
[55:31] in the world with your friends
[55:35] he says I have this against you that you
[55:39] tolerate you put up with
[55:46] this person Jezebel uh
[55:50] this this
[55:51] of course he wasn't talking of the
[55:54] literal person of Jezebel but there was
[55:56] the spirit of Jezebel in the church
[56:05] but we all know who Jezebel was
[56:09] and we know who she was married with
[56:14] a man that was supposed to be a child of
[56:18] God a man that was supposed to be
[56:20] serving the lord
[56:26] but every time
[56:28] brother Brandon would describe him he
[56:31] was wishy washy
[56:36] backslider
[56:38] borderline
[56:39] hypocrite
[56:41] worldly mundano
[56:43] yet he said he was a Christian
[56:47] this is not what what uh in Revelations
[56:50] they're talking they're not talking to
[56:52] Ahab
[56:55] because Ahab completely indulged himself
[56:59] in her Idols
[57:04] he was part of the world yet he would
[57:06] come to the church and say amen
[57:11] he would do whatever he wanted to do but
[57:14] then yet he had the the cloak of
[57:16] righteousness or the cloak of the word
[57:23] no these people God is talking about all
[57:26] right
[57:28] it's Christians serving the lord
[57:32] serving the lord but they put up with
[57:36] Jezebel senior
[57:40] Psalms 1 1 it says
[57:43] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[57:47] the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth
[57:50] in the way of Sinners nor sitteth in the
[57:53] seat of scorn of the scornful
[57:58] is
[58:03] God hates sin
[58:06] and if you're not in the seat of the
[58:09] scornful
[58:13] walk with the Council of the ungodly
[58:18] blessed are you
[58:20] you are blessed because you separate
[58:23] yourself from those people
[58:27] well brother I don't do those things
[58:30] they do you said he said
[58:33] I'm not like them
[58:36] praise God of course you're not mono
[58:38] glorious
[58:39] of course you're not claro quinoa but
[58:43] just like you know in um whenever every
[58:47] time I'd get in trouble when somebody
[58:48] would do something and I was there
[58:50] um
[58:54] they said Eli you're guilty by
[58:57] association
[59:00] you're guilty because you were there
[59:04] well I don't do that I don't do what
[59:06] they do
[59:07] you know but I have one thing against
[59:11] you the Lord said
[59:14] because you put up with sin
[59:18] because you tolerated
[59:21] you let it in your bedroom
[59:26] to let it enter into your phones
[59:30] you let it enter into your household
[59:35] well I'm not part of that
[59:38] you tolerate it you suffer with it
[59:43] and that's the one thing God had against
[59:46] him
[59:48] you know I had a dream once
[59:51] when I first gave my heart to the Lord
[59:56] I I gave my heart to the Lord
[1:00:00] and I moved back to where I used to live
[1:00:05] where all my friends used to be
[1:00:08] Amigos all my buddies that I used to
[1:00:11] drink with
[1:00:14] all the people I knew
[1:00:17] they were they were there in my backyard
[1:00:23] basically I'm saying they were there
[1:00:25] just a block away of my neighbors they
[1:00:28] were all around
[1:00:34] and I felt myself being in a dilemma
[1:00:39] because my buddies would come back and
[1:00:42] and they would want to talk to me and
[1:00:43] they would want to hang out with me
[1:00:48] so I had a dream
[1:00:51] and the dream was I was in this room
[1:00:56] and in this room or in this house they
[1:00:59] was full of drugs and alcohol and people
[1:01:03] and women and just all kinds of things
[1:01:07] of sin is
[1:01:13] that was my version of sin is
[1:01:17] so it was presenting all of that
[1:01:22] partying and drinking and all of it
[1:01:27] and I didn't do any of it
[1:01:32] I'm not going to do any of this
[1:01:36] then one of my friends called from the
[1:01:39] other side of the room
[1:01:43] that Eli we're going to need some more
[1:01:45] beer
[1:01:47] okay let me go grab some more okay
[1:01:50] I went grabbed some more and I gave it
[1:01:53] to them
[1:01:54] and I said praise God I'm not sinning or
[1:01:57] I'm not doing anything
[1:02:01] then a voice came down
[1:02:03] and said Eli you're guilty
[1:02:07] you're guilty because you're accepting
[1:02:11] the sin around you is
[1:02:16] many times in my life
[1:02:19] that I had to realize that I could not
[1:02:22] go into the devil's territory
[1:02:27] it didn't matter if I didn't cuss if I
[1:02:30] didn't drink if I didn't even want it
[1:02:36] a Christian should never be in that the
[1:02:40] devil's territory
[1:02:43] Diablo because the devil does not like
[1:02:46] you know Diablo because the devil is
[1:02:50] your enemy
[1:02:53] and and just think of somebody that is
[1:02:56] going there with all their friends that
[1:02:59] smoke drink or whatever they do all
[1:03:00] right
[1:03:06] and here here you come with your Bible
[1:03:08] in your phone
[1:03:11] here you come just love in the Lord
[1:03:16] Devil's not going to like that
[1:03:19] you have to be killed
[1:03:23] amen amen
[1:03:25] we have to be careful what we do yeah
[1:03:30] what kind of friends we surround
[1:03:32] ourselves with
[1:03:35] now there's a story
[1:03:38] who who knows the king Jehoshaphat
[1:03:43] if you want to raise your hands whoever
[1:03:45] knows the king Jehovah
[1:03:49] awesome
[1:03:52] he was an amazing king of Judah
[1:03:56] there was a time where where Israel they
[1:04:00] split into two kingdoms
[1:04:04] because one king wanted to be to to be
[1:04:07] the king of Israel and the other one
[1:04:09] wanted to be uh
[1:04:13] and finally the kingdom split into it
[1:04:19] and there was the northern kingdom was
[1:04:23] the Kingdom of Israel
[1:04:27] and the kingdom of the South was the
[1:04:30] kingdom of Judah
[1:04:34] and they begin to
[1:04:37] to have wars against each other
[1:04:42] they had their own Kings they had their
[1:04:45] own prophets they had everything and
[1:04:47] they they grew strong into strong
[1:04:48] countries
[1:04:57] they didn't want anything to do with one
[1:04:59] another
[1:05:02] but then Here Comes This King named
[1:05:04] Jehoshaphat
[1:05:07] he was a good King
[1:05:10] he loved the Lord
[1:05:13] the Bible says if you'd like to turn in
[1:05:17] II Chronicles 17 uh
[1:05:23] it says now
[1:05:25] now the king of Jehoshaphat that um
[1:05:29] he strengthened himself from the Kingdom
[1:05:33] of Israel what verse
[1:05:36] um
[1:05:37] second chronicles 17 1.
[1:05:40] uh
[1:05:47] so that's the first thing he did
[1:05:50] he secured the borders
[1:05:54] he made sure everything they were going
[1:05:56] to be safe
[1:06:00] he was a good King
[1:06:03] but as we continue with the story of
[1:06:05] Jehoshaphat
[1:06:07] we're going to notice a very plain facts
[1:06:14] that he hated the fact that the two
[1:06:16] kingdoms were divided
[1:06:21] he hated the fact that God's nation was
[1:06:24] divided
[1:06:28] he hated it so much
[1:06:31] that he was willing to compromise
[1:06:34] everything that he built in order to
[1:06:36] build back that Unity
[1:06:44] he had good intentions
[1:06:47] to mend back whatever was lost
[1:06:52] but it was God's will for them to be
[1:06:55] separated
[1:06:58] see not all Unity is okay
[1:07:04] well I'm gonna go over there so I can
[1:07:06] talk to them about the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:17] you have to be careful
[1:07:20] not all Unity not all Fellowship is the
[1:07:24] will of God
[1:07:25] is
[1:07:28] but that's what he wanted that you could
[1:07:31] see in the story that he desired for
[1:07:33] that Unity to be back
[1:07:40] in second chronicles uh two it says that
[1:07:43] he now this is what he did for Judah
[1:07:47] is
[1:07:50] he stationed troops and fortify the
[1:07:52] towns of Judah he assigned additional
[1:07:56] garrisons to the land of Judah and to
[1:07:58] the towns of Ephraim that his father ASA
[1:08:01] had captured
[1:08:20] because he followed the example of his
[1:08:23] father David's early years and did not
[1:08:25] worship the images of
[1:08:28] bills
[1:08:32] Amen to make that decision that you
[1:08:34] don't want to be part of the world
[1:08:35] anymore
[1:08:39] watch God begin to bless your life
[1:08:44] watch God begin to put everything in
[1:08:47] order for you
[1:08:51] so the Lord established jehoshaphat's
[1:08:54] control over the kingdom of Judah all
[1:08:56] the people of Judah brought gifts to
[1:08:58] Jehoshaphat so he became very wealthy
[1:09:01] and high esteemed
[1:09:10] and it says that he was deeply committed
[1:09:13] to the ways of the Lord he removed the
[1:09:16] Pagan shrines of asherah polls of from
[1:09:19] Judah
[1:09:21] what verse is that six
[1:09:24] it is
[1:09:32] and as you continue on
[1:09:35] you see that he brought back the word
[1:09:41] so he he didn't just throw the world out
[1:09:45] throw the idols out of his life or out
[1:09:47] of Judah
[1:09:48] foreign
[1:09:51] but the Bible says that he began to get
[1:09:55] people to go around the cities of Judah
[1:09:58] and teach the law the law the word
[1:10:01] foreign
[1:10:32] says about you you said
[1:10:35] once you are connected with Christ
[1:10:39] This is a love letter
[1:10:42] this is a book of promise to you now
[1:10:48] maybe it was scary maybe it was hard
[1:10:51] maybe it was difficult to read it but
[1:10:53] now when you're serving the lord this is
[1:10:55] a book of promise
[1:11:01] this will give you all your spiritual
[1:11:04] vitamins
[1:11:06] it said whenever he started to teach the
[1:11:10] people about the the word
[1:11:15] that the other countries around him
[1:11:18] begin to
[1:11:20] fears
[1:11:23] people begin to bring tributes to him
[1:11:26] like the Philistines and and the syrians
[1:11:33] Syria they they knew that God was with
[1:11:37] them
[1:11:39] he built castles and he had a great Army
[1:11:46] that was King Jehoshaphat
[1:11:49] that is you when you're serving the lord
[1:11:53] you're established with the Lord
[1:11:57] and he was blessed because his soul
[1:12:00] desire
[1:12:01] foreign
[1:12:08] to serve him with all of his heart
[1:12:12] amen amen
[1:12:14] but something in him he couldn't help it
[1:12:20] bugged him that the houses of Jacob were
[1:12:23] splits
[1:12:28] he he
[1:12:29] was looking for the opportunities to
[1:12:32] mend the two houses together
[1:12:39] who is the King of the North
[1:12:42] who is the king of Israel Israel
[1:12:46] it was Ahab for a cup
[1:12:48] just like I said he was wishy-washy
[1:12:52] she was a hypocrite
[1:12:55] he was the one that says Ah it's okay I
[1:12:58] believe the message too come on take it
[1:13:01] take a hit take another smoke of this
[1:13:03] yeah
[1:13:09] oh yeah I believe I believe the prophet
[1:13:13] but then they do the things of the world
[1:13:17] see when I was in the world over there
[1:13:20] where I lived
[1:13:23] there was not many message Believers
[1:13:27] it was just our little group
[1:13:30] so when I was out in the world
[1:13:34] I was out with Catholics and we're in
[1:13:38] atheists and whatever they they didn't
[1:13:40] care at all
[1:13:44] what I noticed here
[1:13:47] is there's many that are close to the
[1:13:50] message
[1:13:53] that you can go to the world
[1:13:56] and it's not very far
[1:13:59] it's not very far you don't have to go
[1:14:02] all the way with the Catholics that
[1:14:04] don't know anything about the message no
[1:14:06] they know the message
[1:14:11] you don't you don't have to go very far
[1:14:14] to go into the world here
[1:14:20] and Ahab he he would claim that he was
[1:14:25] still a follower of the Lord but he
[1:14:26] wasn't
[1:14:32] says this in painted face Jezebel all
[1:14:34] right this is
[1:14:37] Ahab was a borderline lukewarm believer
[1:14:41] just indemned it to uh in
[1:14:44] indentment to Society of Christianity
[1:14:48] would be today
[1:14:59] he was wishy-washy and not stable at all
[1:15:07] now that was the king so what was the
[1:15:10] condition of Israel
[1:15:14] now in that day when just at midnight of
[1:15:18] Israel's history
[1:15:23] so in that day with Ahab that was the
[1:15:27] darkest time of Israel
[1:15:35] it was the midnight
[1:15:38] Solomon and David those were the
[1:15:40] brightest those were the Golden Ages
[1:15:47] but what did Ahab do
[1:15:51] he introduced
[1:15:53] he introduced the nation to a woman that
[1:15:57] was a heathen that was an idol worshiper
[1:16:04] and that was the first time a king of
[1:16:07] Israel married an idol worshiper a
[1:16:11] heathens
[1:16:16] and she's the very representation
[1:16:22] of hatred
[1:16:24] of maliciousness
[1:16:30] that's what who she was
[1:16:35] she wanted to when something didn't go
[1:16:37] her way
[1:16:40] she would go and start slaying people uh
[1:16:43] the uh the Jews
[1:16:47] if they didn't bow down to her Gods
[1:16:52] if Ahab needed them she would just slay
[1:16:56] them
[1:16:59] that's who she was
[1:17:02] they have wherever she wanted to move
[1:17:06] so if we could say the Israel was a type
[1:17:10] of the world and everything bad in it is
[1:17:17] one of those friends you have to watch
[1:17:20] out for
[1:17:21] Amigos
[1:17:23] oh I believe the message
[1:17:26] oh I believe this this and that but you
[1:17:29] got to be careful yes
[1:17:34] second chronicles 18 1.
[1:17:39] it says Lisa now Jehoshaphat had riches
[1:17:43] and honor in abundance I love that
[1:17:47] Gloria
[1:17:49] oh he was blessed by God
[1:17:54] but then it says and join Affinity with
[1:17:57] Ahab
[1:18:02] there was nothing wrong with Jehoshaphat
[1:18:07] he wasn't an adulterer like David or
[1:18:10] Solomon
[1:18:12] he was in a murderer like David
[1:18:16] if I could say
[1:18:19] he was one of the greatest Kings of
[1:18:22] Judah
[1:18:25] but God had one thing against him
[1:18:29] that he tolerated
[1:18:31] that woman Jezebel and Ahab her husband
[1:18:37] that he wanted to be friends with him he
[1:18:40] wanted an alliance with them
[1:18:44] so the the Bible says that he joined
[1:18:47] Affinity with Ahab
[1:18:53] what's that how do you say it in Spanish
[1:18:54] uh kinship but in Disco he joined a
[1:18:57] kinship with them
[1:19:02] so that word Affinity means Chatham or
[1:19:06] chaitan and this is
[1:19:10] which is a Hebrew word
[1:19:13] and what that is is to give away in
[1:19:16] marriage
[1:19:19] matrimonial and normally it would be a
[1:19:21] daughter but in this case he gave away
[1:19:23] his son in marriage
[1:19:28] so it means to form a contract of
[1:19:33] Alliance by marriage
[1:19:39] so what he did was form a contract
[1:19:44] usually if you want to form a contract
[1:19:47] or if you you have a promise or a
[1:19:50] covenant to do with somebody
[1:20:28] which means whom God afflicts
[1:20:33] that seems like an unequal is
[1:20:39] exalted by Jehovah
[1:20:42] and whom God afflicts
[1:20:46] and now they come together
[1:20:50] and they built that Alliance
[1:20:54] and I'll tell you this that was the
[1:20:57] greatest mistake Jehoshaphat made
[1:20:59] foreign
[1:21:37] that's an old proverb but it's the truth
[1:21:40] is
[1:21:47] associate with people who believe God
[1:21:52] don't let your children if you run
[1:21:54] across the street to little old Oswald
[1:21:56] over here he's a little nice boy
[1:21:59] but
[1:22:09] be careful who little Oswald is
[1:22:14] find out what his daddy is
[1:22:18] what his mama is
[1:22:20] they might be a hater of the Gospel
[1:22:26] they might have everything projected
[1:22:29] into little Oswald
[1:22:33] and you let your little boy or your
[1:22:36] little girl associate like that you said
[1:22:41] first thing you know he will become up
[1:22:44] and be like little Oswald
[1:22:51] now you know that's right
[1:22:54] watch your Associates
[1:22:58] keep your company
[1:23:02] limpia amen keep your company clean
[1:23:05] Olympia
[1:23:07] well does it really hurt
[1:23:11] it does
[1:23:15] um I know I'm about to close but let me
[1:23:17] tell you a little story
[1:23:20] I I gave my heart to the Lord
[1:23:24] I made many mistakes in the beginning
[1:23:29] not knowing by ignorance
[1:23:33] I had a really good buddy of mine in in
[1:23:36] the world
[1:23:37] [Music]
[1:23:39] and I gave my heart to the Lord and and
[1:23:42] then I got a call that his father died
[1:23:50] so in my heart I was like I have to go
[1:23:53] over there and pay my respects
[1:23:58] and I finally made that decision because
[1:24:00] I was kind of battling Within Myself I
[1:24:02] got to go over there and pay my respects
[1:24:04] to them
[1:24:10] then I had a brother my oldest brother
[1:24:13] he wasn't serving the lord and
[1:24:18] out of everybody he had to be the one
[1:24:20] correcting me is
[1:24:34] you can't go over there anymore
[1:24:37] you can't be around those kind of people
[1:24:46] well I still went I want to see you free
[1:24:48] and I and I went over there and I found
[1:24:51] out where he they lived
[1:24:55] and sure enough there was a group of
[1:24:57] people is
[1:25:03] they had the music up loud and it was in
[1:25:07] the middle of the day outside
[1:25:14] and I go over there straight to to that
[1:25:17] guy a boy
[1:25:19] and I start paying my respects
[1:25:22] then he starts accusing me of when I
[1:25:25] start if I stole his phone years ago
[1:25:31] they were all intoxicated
[1:25:34] I I didn't I didn't have a shaved head
[1:25:38] no more my my hair was slicked to the
[1:25:40] side
[1:25:45] I look different they said what are you
[1:25:47] a cop now
[1:25:51] I had my shirt tucked in then
[1:25:55] I just love the Lord I changed I don't
[1:25:58] know what happened
[1:26:01] I didn't nobody made me change I just
[1:26:04] didn't want to be like that anymore
[1:26:08] except the Lord wants
[1:26:12] nobody has to tell you anything
[1:26:15] it'll just fall off of you said
[1:26:22] and they said something's wrong with you
[1:26:24] Eli are you a cop are you this are you
[1:26:26] that is
[1:26:30] I had a knife right there on the side
[1:26:34] and one of them pulled it out on me
[1:26:38] and he was over there threatening me
[1:26:41] with the knife
[1:26:43] and I'm thinking to myself
[1:26:46] what did I get myself
[1:26:48] what kind of mess did I put myself in
[1:26:52] over here with sincere heart
[1:26:58] wanting to pay my respects
[1:27:02] but I wasn't the same anymore
[1:27:05] I wasn't them anymore
[1:27:08] I wasn't a wolf Lobo
[1:27:11] I was a I was a lamb I was a sheep
[1:27:15] and all the Wolves they were just
[1:27:18] getting blood hungry
[1:27:21] oh look at Eli he thinks he's better
[1:27:26] I don't remember I don't know how but I
[1:27:29] finally got my knife back
[1:27:33] and then the guy that pulled out the
[1:27:36] knife he started to punch me
[1:27:40] and
[1:27:42] almost the old Eli came out
[1:27:46] but by God's grace I didn't do anything
[1:27:51] and if it was the old Eli I would have
[1:27:53] been ashamed to not do anything
[1:27:58] because in the world
[1:28:00] oh you gotta hold your prize
[1:28:05] even if you go down fighting you gotta
[1:28:07] hold your pride you gotta hold yourself
[1:28:15] he punched me a couple of times
[1:28:18] and I I told them I said you know what
[1:28:21] you need to take care of him
[1:28:23] [Music]
[1:28:24] and then I walked away
[1:28:27] I didn't go in I didn't go in my car
[1:28:30] full of Shame and thinking oh I should
[1:28:32] have I should have gave him a good clean
[1:28:34] one
[1:28:40] I was ashamed to the Lord
[1:28:43] I said I should have never been there
[1:28:46] Lord
[1:28:48] and now I realize
[1:28:51] that I cannot associate myself with them
[1:28:54] anymore
[1:28:56] I can't go to the devil's territory
[1:28:59] anymore
[1:29:00] because no matter how nice they might be
[1:29:06] brother Brandon says they always gotta
[1:29:09] ask to grinding
[1:29:15] they have an ulterior motive
[1:29:19] there's something behind
[1:29:22] and one day Ahab called to Jehoshaphat
[1:29:27] he said
[1:29:29] come with me to Ramos Gilliam
[1:29:34] and fight with me
[1:29:36] God gave us this land oh he began to
[1:29:40] preach him a nice message
[1:29:43] he began to tell him how how they belong
[1:29:47] there and how they're both message
[1:29:48] Believers
[1:29:55] he said your people are my people
[1:29:59] I'm like you and you're like me
[1:30:04] and Jehoshaphat was in a bad condition
[1:30:10] he loved the Lord
[1:30:12] he was just with the wrong people
[1:30:16] he was with the wrong Associates
[1:30:20] but him being a person led by the Lord
[1:30:25] foreign
[1:30:44] let me bring them out to you
[1:30:48] so Ahab brought all 400 prophets
[1:30:53] and every single one of them in unity
[1:30:56] said go out and you will drive them out
[1:31:02] go out and you guys will be successful
[1:31:06] but brother Brandon would always say
[1:31:08] about the story foreign
[1:31:19] [Music]
[1:31:36] it's going to bite you one of these days
[1:31:42] you know living on the edge is a scary
[1:31:44] thing
[1:31:50] but one of these days
[1:31:52] one of these days it'll bite
[1:31:56] sin is no joke
[1:31:59] and so so they they were all saying
[1:32:03] everything was fine and
[1:32:07] said well uh
[1:32:10] do you have one more
[1:32:13] do you have one more that can tell us
[1:32:16] something
[1:32:19] oh yeah I have one more yeah
[1:32:23] but I hate him
[1:32:25] I hate him because he's always prophecy
[1:32:28] prophesying wrong and evil of me
[1:32:35] so don't let the king say so just just
[1:32:38] go and get him
[1:32:42] so they go and get this Prophet Mike um
[1:32:50] and they knock on his door and say
[1:32:52] Makaya they need you
[1:32:56] the king Ahab he needs you necessita
[1:33:00] you you little old Holy Roller you the
[1:33:03] old-fashioned word come here
[1:33:08] a wishy-washy Christian doesn't like the
[1:33:11] true words
[1:33:14] they don't like the real world
[1:33:17] they could talk to you about the message
[1:33:19] and they know a lot
[1:33:22] and they'll know how it's they'll tell
[1:33:25] you how it's okay to cut your hair
[1:33:29] they'll tell you how it's okay to do
[1:33:31] this and to do that and to lie and to
[1:33:34] steal is
[1:33:37] they'll tell you in the Bible how to do
[1:33:40] this this and that that's the 400
[1:33:42] prophets
[1:33:49] that's scary
[1:33:52] that's something we should never tamper
[1:33:55] with
[1:33:57] they'll say all these beautiful things
[1:34:01] but if you're led by the spirit of the
[1:34:04] Lord you
[1:34:07] you'll say well is there one more
[1:34:10] they finally got Makaya
[1:34:14] he said oh you little Holy Roller
[1:34:18] he said we need you to prophesy
[1:34:24] and then they began to say they're
[1:34:27] saying that they're gonna win and
[1:34:29] they're gonna drive them out and you say
[1:34:31] the same thing okay
[1:34:37] he said I can't say anything but the
[1:34:39] what the Lord tells me to say
[1:34:45] and they said okay well King
[1:34:47] jehoshaphat's with them
[1:34:50] brother Branham says that Makaya stopped
[1:34:55] he said
[1:34:59] not him no not her
[1:35:04] they love the Lord
[1:35:06] and brother Branham says he says Ah
[1:35:09] that's what the Lord was telling me
[1:35:11] about it is
[1:35:15] imagine having the prophet here
[1:35:19] the Bible says there was eyes like fire
[1:35:24] and he says I know your Works
[1:35:29] they've been good
[1:35:31] you've been faithful but one thing I
[1:35:34] have against you
[1:35:36] he said Ah that's what the Lord was
[1:35:39] telling me about
[1:35:42] and he shook his head and he said I
[1:35:44] can't believe he's with that old
[1:35:46] wishy-washy hypocritical hypocritical
[1:35:49] person
[1:35:52] is
[1:35:54] [Music]
[1:35:59] he goes up there and from the survey and
[1:36:03] he he lies just like all of them
[1:36:06] so here he comes and he says yeah go up
[1:36:09] there you'll be all right
[1:36:13] but Ahab said no that doesn't sound
[1:36:17] right
[1:36:19] he says say the truth
[1:36:21] he says go up there and Israel will be
[1:36:24] like sheep scattered without a Shepherd
[1:36:27] Israel is
[1:36:30] he couldn't deny the word
[1:36:33] the word already cursed the sin
[1:36:38] the word is against it
[1:36:42] the word is against those things
[1:36:45] how can God bless something he's already
[1:36:48] cursed
[1:36:51] how could we be okay walking around with
[1:36:54] those things when he's already cursed it
[1:37:01] was
[1:37:03] cursedo and God told him he was going to
[1:37:06] die in battle his head was going to be
[1:37:07] chopped up and his wife was going to be
[1:37:09] fed to the dogs
[1:37:25] they have said see look at he's always
[1:37:28] prophesying against me
[1:37:32] The Sinner the the backslider the
[1:37:35] wishy-washy doesn't like the word
[1:37:40] oh look at that old little old Holy
[1:37:43] Roller always preaching negative things
[1:37:48] he's always preaching against me
[1:37:51] he's always doing this and he's always
[1:37:54] doing that
[1:37:56] well we better check our life if we're
[1:37:58] getting uncomfortable with the word
[1:38:02] we better check something if we're not
[1:38:05] exactly happy with what's being said
[1:38:11] either the Makaya that is preaching is
[1:38:14] not preaching right or some things wrong
[1:38:16] with our life
[1:38:22] ended up going anywhere
[1:38:26] in closing Ahab told him
[1:38:30] he said you know what you keep your nice
[1:38:33] clean kingly robes on
[1:38:37] he said I'm going to dress like a
[1:38:39] regular soldier
[1:38:42] that shows that Ahab believed the word
[1:38:47] he was trying to to out
[1:38:50] outlive the world
[1:38:54] because he knew the word prophesied
[1:38:57] against him
[1:39:00] so he said let me hide let me do this
[1:39:04] but you Jehovah you you put on your
[1:39:08] kingly robe
[1:39:11] believe me every time that ungodly
[1:39:15] associates
[1:39:18] they have ulterior motives
[1:39:23] what was he doing to Jehoshaphat
[1:39:27] he was making Jehoshaphat look like the
[1:39:29] king
[1:39:32] he didn't care of Jehoshaphat passed
[1:39:35] away
[1:39:38] be careful who you're with
[1:39:41] because there's people that hate the
[1:39:43] gospel
[1:39:45] people that hate the word
[1:39:49] people that hate the message
[1:39:52] that grew up in this church
[1:39:55] that grew up in the message
[1:40:00] and they they try to say good things
[1:40:04] they try to be intelligent
[1:40:07] they try to give you good advice
[1:40:10] but how could anything good come out of
[1:40:13] something that hates the world
[1:40:18] we have to be careful who we take our
[1:40:21] advice who our friends are who we're
[1:40:23] we're sitting and eating around
[1:40:31] they were they went out to the war egos
[1:40:35] all of the the people
[1:40:41] and before they went to the world war
[1:40:43] they said you know what don't even worry
[1:40:45] about all the Warriors just focus on
[1:40:48] Ahab we need to kill
[1:40:50] himself
[1:40:55] who's the one that looked like the king
[1:40:59] it was Ahab I mean it was Jehoshaphat
[1:41:02] and they went and they almost killed him
[1:41:06] and he cried out to the Lord and the
[1:41:08] Lord saved him
[1:41:11] and by chance somebody drew their arrow
[1:41:14] and shot Ahab and killed him
[1:41:21] because God you know once he curses
[1:41:24] something then you cannot change the
[1:41:25] word
[1:41:28] if the musicians would come up
[1:41:32] there was a a man named jehu
[1:41:36] he he
[1:41:38] condemned and he uh told Jehoshaphat
[1:41:44] he said why do you
[1:41:47] why are you around the people that hate
[1:41:49] me so much
[1:41:56] nevertheless the Lord has blessed you
[1:42:00] know how many more times
[1:42:05] he did that with ahab's son um
[1:42:11] when they called Elijah
[1:42:15] when they called the prophet and Elisha
[1:42:17] said I don't even want to talk to the
[1:42:19] king of Israel
[1:42:21] is
[1:42:24] he said I don't wouldn't even look at
[1:42:27] him I wouldn't even speak his way but
[1:42:30] just because the righteous man
[1:42:31] Jehoshaphat is here that's why I'm here
[1:42:40] Jehoshaphat he he just kept having
[1:42:44] worldly friends
[1:42:48] he ended up passing away
[1:42:52] there was there was another time that he
[1:42:55] he uh did trading deals with another on
[1:42:59] world a worldly person a result
[1:43:05] and finally he passed away
[1:43:10] but remember his biggest mistake foreign
[1:43:25] [Music]
[1:43:42] and she gets the throne from her son as
[1:43:46] a as a higher yeah
[1:43:49] she becomes the queen
[1:43:52] she she doesn't have somebody else to be
[1:43:55] the king she becomes the king because
[1:43:57] the queen
[1:44:02] and what she does is
[1:44:04] she begins to kill all of as a higher's
[1:44:08] children
[1:44:12] that's her grandchildren Jesus but they
[1:44:15] were the heir to the throne of Judah
[1:44:17] foreign
[1:44:39] just because Ahab wanted to align
[1:44:42] himself with a
[1:44:46] person's whole family to be wiped out
[1:44:51] just because he wanted to be Allied to
[1:44:54] Ahab Namaz
[1:44:58] see it's got Ripple effects the things
[1:45:01] we do
[1:45:04] even after they were gone she wiped out
[1:45:07] the whole seed of Judah and this person
[1:45:13] and there was one little boy that that
[1:45:17] was able to escape from her wrath
[1:45:21] and he was part of that seed of Judah
[1:45:25] yeah
[1:45:27] if it wasn't for God's will foreign
[1:46:16] the devil was working the whole way
[1:46:21] trying to wipe away the seed of God
[1:46:26] and no matter how good your friendships
[1:46:29] look
[1:46:31] no matter how good the sin looks
[1:46:36] watch out because there's a ulterior
[1:46:38] motive
[1:46:41] but remember the saying can't wipe you
[1:46:44] out
[1:46:47] you are the Royal seed of God
[1:46:51] he's trying to wipe you out
[1:46:54] because he knows Jesus lives in your
[1:46:57] heart
[1:46:59] he knows Jesus was born in you one day
[1:47:04] and no matter how much the devil tries
[1:47:09] God is with you
[1:47:11] the Bible says abstain from the very
[1:47:14] appearance of sin
[1:47:24] there was one time there was a man that
[1:47:26] needed to cross the canyon Davis
[1:47:30] so there was three writers
[1:47:34] the first writer said you know what I
[1:47:36] could take you El Primerica
[1:47:39] I can I can write 10 inches close to the
[1:47:43] edge
[1:47:47] riding 45 miles per hour
[1:47:51] the other one laughed he said Ah that's
[1:47:54] funny
[1:47:56] he said you know what you know how good
[1:47:58] of a writer I am yeah
[1:48:01] he said I could I could take you and I
[1:48:04] can ride four inches close to the air
[1:48:06] yeah
[1:48:15] and he said okay
[1:48:18] and he saw a little old man there
[1:48:21] sitting there
[1:48:23] he said what about you sir
[1:48:27] he said well maybe I could do that
[1:48:31] maybe I can write you right on the edge
[1:48:35] like that
[1:48:37] he said but what I do foreign
[1:48:43] [Music]
[1:48:59] see Christianity is not how close you
[1:49:02] can get to sin Christian
[1:49:06] get so close to sin without sinning
[1:49:11] try to get as far as away from it as you
[1:49:14] can
[1:49:17] get away from oh everything that is has
[1:49:21] the appearance of evil
[1:49:25] oh it'll save you so much grief
[1:49:30] it'll save you so much
[1:49:34] when we are unequally yoked with
[1:49:36] unbelievers
[1:49:39] the Bible says it's like holding fire to
[1:49:42] our bosom this is
[1:49:46] a hard thing
[1:49:49] it's a hard life to live
[1:49:52] because it's not only going to affect
[1:49:54] you now
[1:49:56] but it has a ripple effect
[1:50:00] and it'll it'll affect you from the from
[1:50:03] now all the way down
[1:50:06] especially if you choose somebody an
[1:50:09] unbeliever to be with to to marry is
[1:50:17] it's already an adventure
[1:50:20] if you're married with a Christian you
[1:50:23] still got your ups and downs
[1:50:27] you still got your good days and your
[1:50:29] bad days
[1:50:31] I would be lying to you if there's no
[1:50:34] arguments
[1:50:36] if there's no disagreements
[1:50:40] but yet you guys have the same goals
