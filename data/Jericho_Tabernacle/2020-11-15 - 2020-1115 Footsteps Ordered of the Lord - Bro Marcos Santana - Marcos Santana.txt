alvarado for the trust and confidence to be able to be up here speaking this morning to share once more another portion of his word something that might stimulate or motivate his children and this morning i have a bit of a thanksgiving inside of my heart three thanksgivings in my heart the first being for my salvation el primero el cuales mis salvation and then two days ago i got into a very uh dangerous car accident uh estudent accidental where i crashed into a flatbed semi truck and in observing how the crash took place i didn't notice how serious it could have been that if that flatbed were to be any higher caso uh la parte plana del cabiones alta it would have overpassed the hood of the car and gone straight through the windshield but i thank god that he was watching over me that day i thank god that i'm here and healthy this morning and i also want to give thanks to god for being able to have my parents here uh poderta nerami's father my father my mother my father and my mother and also my sister it's a honor and privilege to have them here yes i haven't seen them since we moved here to phoenix phoenix just want to let them know that i love you okay and lastly i want to give thanks to god that has gone home to be with the lord this sister's name el nombre de la mana is sister and we met this sister in in pretoria south africa in pretoria africa me myself and my sister traveled for some meetings out there and they the the pastor and the congregation there they found out that it was our wedding anniversary during that time and they they threw us a small party for our anniversary celebration fiesta anniversary and there was something about this sister that stood out to me and my wife she was uh probably the most darkest skinned sister of all the african sisters there quesadillas hermanos africana but the glow that was on her was just so vibrant you could just tell that she was overflowing with the holy spirit within her body when she would sing to us and just the smile that she had the way she would serve the food that she would give the dessert out of the church he told us we want to take you to visit one of the poorest neighborhoods in pretoria uh and this is called alexandria alexandra where nelson mandela was born and raised nelson mandela for those of you that are familiar with that history and we want to take you so you can meet one of the sweetest most humblest sisters of our congregation uh i haven't been all over latin america myself latin america but just seeing the videos videos of how rough it is and how dangerous it looks uh it doesn't compare to the place they took us to compare and this in this shack to our surprise the person that lives here with that glowingness coming from her face and there was about 10 or 12 of us there in addition to her and her grandson and now the shack that she lives in is no more than six feet wide is known as the uh and maybe 12 to 15 feet long where somehow they managed to squeeze a tiny bed a really small couch and shelves all on all four walls stacked from the ground to the ceiling and now we would just see and think to ourselves how much she lacks how much she doesn't physically have on this earth where there she her daughter and her grandson live but yet she has a joy coming from within her that i've never seen before she starts testifying of the miracles that have taken place in her life and then she tells us he knows but today is a special day we are i am truly blessed angels from heaven have come to leave their footsteps in my home we offered to give her a hundred dollars in their currency that goes a long way in south africa and she wouldn't receive it she would reject it but instead she grabbed of her own food out of the poverty that she's in de la pubres and said no i want to bless you that you and your sister and your wife kenny hermano it was just such a beautiful testimony for us an experience in our lives and i'm happy and proud to know but i know how happy she was while being in this world and she's now even more happy where she finds herself today if you could turn to the book of psalms chapter 37 we're going to read verse 23 and 24. psalms 37 23 reads almost 23 the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the lord upholdeth him with his hand thank you lord jesus for another day of life thank you lord for having your hand in my life lord manuel for saving me from that dangerous accident father this accident and i thank you lord jesus for every one of my brothers and sisters here present lord for any of those present and invisible audience lord that you've been watching over him over them with that they find themselves this morning wanting to get more of you and we all just want to hear from you this morning may you share this small portion of the word with your children may you call my nerves this morning and help me and my interpreter this morning are you the we love you lord jesus jesus we give you all the honor and glory glory may you have preeminence in this service in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray christ amen i'm in you may be seated uh to to give this message uh a title [Music] uh i would like to title it footsteps ordered of the lord los pasos ordenados and to give it a subtitle uh we're going to say desperation and and we'll see if we can get into that desperation and throughout the week i don't know why i kept being pulled back to the story of jonah regress and jonah is a very well-known story in the bible that's taught to us in the sunday schools that god came to this man named jonah okay and that jonah was given a commission by god or an order from god to go where the bible says to arise and to go on to nineveh the scriptures say cry out unto nineveh it was gold preached for their wickedness their sins are great and this man jonah yes like we know he didn't listen to the word of god he didn't listen to the commission that was sent to him instead of going out onto nineveh the bible says that he got on a boat and fled from the presence of the lord and storms and waves throughout the ocean so tremendous that it was at the point of breaking down that ship where all the sailors and even the shipmaster were scared and desperate and nervous brother branham says in the message behold a greater than solomon is here this element speaking about jonah well we know that all of them cried out that they was going to sink and that there was something wrong and jonah came up and then he confessed he confessed that this could be his fault he said to bind his feet in his hands and to throw him overboard because it wasn't right for all of them to perish because of him no no i find it so amazing that here jonah was fleeing away from the presence of god god sending him in one direction and him going backwards to another direction we could say in other words he was back sliding and and this wasn't just anyone this was what brother brown says was a prophet of god yes and in the book of jonah it says so they took up jonah they cast them forth into the sea illocharon and then the sea ceased from raging so after them sending him out the the skies got clear the these weren't believers of jehovah these weren't believers of the i am that i am because moments before moments the bible says that these mariners they were all afraid they were desperate they were scared and that every one of these men they cried out unto their god so these were believers of other gods strange gods and what a scene that god takes advantage of every single moment that through every single pair of eyes that was there on that ship they were able to see the power of that almighty god in action jonah didn't preach to these shipmates about repentance he taught every single man on that ship that there would that salvation requires a perfect sacrifice and that perfect sacrifice yes for everyone to be saved on that ship to not die on that sea but to not be destroyed by that storm was that it had to be jonah that was thrown off the ship they couldn't throw out the shipmaster they could have cast out their luggage to to make the ship lighter nope none of that was going to stop this storm jonah had the revelation that he needed to be thrown out for the safety and salvation of everyone on that ship and then what happens next the bible says that the men feared the lord exceedingly and they offered a sacrifice unto the lord and they made vows that once the and those men were now converted unto that true god they offered their own personal sacrifices sacrifices personally that sacrifice of repentance unto god and they made a personal vow with him brother branham says in the same message this is my brand name is mansaki and i always felt sorry for jonah because many people i think they misunderstood jonah muchos personas now they said jonah was backslidden and he was this and he was that and he was the other iq and i've said the same thing but let's just study jonah for a minute i don't believe that he was backslid because he was god's prophet and he seemed to be walking out of the will of god but the little story that i want to tell you in a moment i believe that you will all see and i tried my hardest to try and find it where brother branham was talking donde hable branham about that if we so much as doubted doubt our testimony testimony that we've already backslid just from simply doubting i just couldn't find it i wanted to read it this morning personally i struggled for years to believe my own testimony my own experience so in other words one is like a temporary action and then the other one is like a long-term or permanent condition or state of being jonah was not a backslider jonah had simply backslid you know the footsteps of the righteous or ordered of the lord now that doesn't take away from our own desperation jonah when he was awakened you can only imagine what he was seeing uh maybe like the titanic the storm about to destroy everyone in the boat but then desperation kicks in jonah knew he was fleeing from the presence of god he thought this wasn't some escape artist that could be thrown under water and escape this was real life for jonah brother says his hands were tied his feet were tied when he was thrown into the sea this is hopeless probably thinking this is it for me but brother branham says better this is but i'm going to try and take up for that preacher tonight and i'm going to say i believe he was a prophet and he was exactly in the will of god i believe he followed the leading of the spirit i believe he was led to go that way he didn't understand it after god had commissioned him in one place and then here he found himself going another way here jonah now being swallowed up by the whale may be thinking could this be my salvation or maybe this is the finale to my death okay i'm going to die here in the belly of this whale it says that it wasn't until after those three days and three nights that he finally started to pray unto god after those long three desperate days in the whale's belly where he saw that nothing and no one else can save him and help him donde miraculous bible says then jonah prayed unto the lord god to get him out of the fish's belly and i will pay that which i vow that salvation is of the lord and we know what happened next in the story of jonah he was spit up on the shores of nineveh he fulfilled what god wanted of him and those people repented and god saved that people but it took no it took jonah experience after experience for him to see the light not the experience of going from an unbeliever to a believer no experience but jonah was already a christian he was already a believer the issue was jonah had to wake up where he could finally reach out and grab that hand because jonah had heard the direct voice of god it wasn't enough for him jonah saw the powerful hand in the storm that was taking place but it wasn't enough for him jonah was saved and swallowed up by that whale but it wasn't until he found himself himself in that place of desperation where he had to choose between life or death isn't the message desperations this is when you pray for the baptism of the holy spirit the token don't say no diga well now i'll go up there and try and boy lord i'm just a little tired says oh mercy just stay in your seat then don't even make an attempt if you come vienna and you say i'll pass through the prayer line i'll put a little oil on my head i'll see if it does me any good but you might as well just set where you're at is that when he was a young man he had felt a pull in his life cynthia that drove him to that altar where he wanted to be prayed for don de queria and this brother he did get prayed for isis but nothing happened but maybe that holy spirit just touched him on the exterior but because of what had happened to him on that day he swore to himself that he would never again go up to the altar to be prayed for hamas unless almenos unless he knew that it was god being the one that was pulling him and now on one side such a simple but deep revelation how it is that man doesn't search for god it's god that searches for the man yet once he finds us and now we find ourselves seeking more and more of him but how it is that he hides himself in simplicity for us to want more and more and more of him and like i said this brother wasn't looking for god no more ecomodic he was fleeing just like jonah but the moment came in his life to open him up to the reality of life getting into that desperate state knowing that this is a matter of life or death and that desperation drove that brother branham says lisa amano branham until you get to that place until the whole church gets to a place that it's between death and life it takes desperation to bring god on the scene and so in looking at jonah miranda i i was pulled toward the life of peter pedro and peter is our precious brother in the faith and in the book of luke chapter 22. here was jesus jesus and he directed himself to peter pedro and he says behold it is satan has desired to have you satan but i have prayed for thee and when thou art converted so satan knew that peter was a very important piece in god's economy important peace in god's plan satan knows that each and every one of you are an important piece in god's plan that's why satan desires to have every one of your satanists that satan was desiring to take hold of peter pedro that's why jesus had already gotten into a deep prayer with god that when the great time of trial comes when that testing that pressure that desperation comes the scripture says faith fail thee and i try to put myself in those scriptures you should put yourself in those scriptures jesus was making an intercession for peter unto god to give him faith because he knew those dark times were coming but jesus did more than that for you and me for me he prayed unto the father for us to have faith we were inside of jesus jesus so that prayer for peter pedro that prayer was for me that prayer is for you i need that god sent faith and what blows my mind is at the end of verse 32 the scripture says and when thou art converted then strengthened thy brethren confirmed but peter had already been given the keys to the kingdom peter was the one with the great revelations seems to me like peter was the man but the scriptures tell us that he wasn't even converted i've learned that there's a difference between being convinced and being converted and it takes me immediately to the words of paul immediately have you received the holy ghost since you believe jesus was here saying the same word saying the same thing but in different words unto peter jesus so peter you're my disciple you're you're a believer peter you've got faith but you have yet to be converted so then how then are we converted when we receive that baptism of the holy ghost we are then now born again to go from convinced unto converted peter was convinced supernaturally pedro sovereign a sovereign natural mention when he was called to be a disciple he was convinced by the wisdom of jesus christ he was convinced by the miracles that jesus performed he was convinced by the very life in itself of jesus jesus a convinced believer and maybe someone in here is only a convinced believer today and you know the pastor is so humble it's convinced me me a convention the sisters are so sweet it's convinced me unconventional the ministers they're just so wise it's convincing the church is so orderly it's convincing me this message of the hour has so much revelation it's convincing me yes and amen to all of that but have you received the holy ghost since you believed that's to break past that intellectual righteous christian mentality mentality christianity intellectually enter into being converted christians that's why i say put yourself in that scripture foreign joshua [Music] but and to enter into being converted see peter had forgotten an experience that he had previously had with jesus place about the resurrection that was going to take place but peter got angry peter got bold peter the bible says he rebuked jesus what a mind-blowing thing that in one moment the spirit of god was upon peter in the spirit in the next moment the spirit of satan was upon peter don't die jesus please don't die jesus why don't you just stay with us you're the son of god teach us a little bit more do a couple more miracles that the perfect sacrifice had to be offered that the lamb had to be slain that nothing could impede that from happening it didn't matter what good intentions peter might have had no importa anything that tried to stop that plan was nothing more but satan himself [Music] and that's how simple it is i'll see this in the u.s your brother he can be anointed of god in one moment and he's lifting you up and then in an instant his or her flesh can be anointed we don't they might be anointing your brother or anointing your sister they might be causing you to have that difference or dissension among each other we've got to see behind that and judge the spirit but now coming back to the future jesus said jesus but i have prayed for thee that thy faith failed and when thou art converted strengthened i want you to truly be converted once you're truly converted then you can strengthen your brothers you can guide your brethren peter was still focused on the fleshly things and not the spiritual things pedro established the spirituality therefore that's why peter replied i'll go to jail for you i'll go to jail with you i'll fight with you i'll do anything to be by your side and what an awesome god we serve today that he knew that we would choose him therefore he made us sons and daughters of his he chose for us to be his bride forgive me jonah he knew that jonah was going to deny the shall not crow this day no before thou shalt three times deny that thou knowest me. and we go back to the base scripture is it said the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord that though he would fall okay the lord upholdeth him with his hand so the very footsteps of disobedience from jonah and just las propios pasos de dis don't you think that peter by any means possible he would have not denied the name of jesus christ but jesus christ was the word and the word had said peter you will deny me three times pedro negara you will deny me me that was the word of god to deny jesus it almost seems illogical but the word made flesh spoken and therefore it had to take place for all that was inside of peter it was up to him he would have never done that because he had just got done saying with all of his heart with the conviction with the sincerity that he would die for jesus it was preordained for peter to do so preorder the footsteps of the righteous peter was of those righteous pedro his denial was already ordained that though peter should fall pedro and that peter would deny jesus the lord would still uphold him with his hand your footsteps are ordained today suspense he will hold you up by his hands three desperate days in the belly of the whale just like peter asico pedro it took him three times to be accused to be chased they said to be pointed out they said to be marked i don't know this man whom you speak up he was so scared he was so concerned he was so desperate that he had to say something to get out of this corner he was in a he remembered those words that the lord jesus christ told him that before the crow thou shalt deny me three times and he went out isalio and he wept bitterly what a scene that that was it that three times he denied jesus christ and that on he sees the face of god himself the lord jesus christ looking at him eye to eye and he comes back to his mind that he had told jesus [Music] but it doesn't get more depressing than that maybe you've denied him in your life maybe you've denied him up to this point you may have had experience after experience wanting this is just too much for me please stand we're going to be closing but thanks to god for the grace that he's extended unto us for the promises that he has given us for this word that he gave unto us that our footsteps have already been ordained foreign peter saw that god made flesh pedro said right after he had denied him and through all of that swearing and all of that cursing him so bad the pastor isn't the one convincing you el paso it's not the ministers that are convincing you it's not your mama your daddy that's convincing you but it's the word of god that has convinced you this far you've been convinced that the god almighty he is otherwise you can't even explain the existence of the universe of the universe you've already heard him use the yellow or y'all you have heard him for yourselves because then you can't explain the little faith that's already in your heart and you're feeling him this morning how can you explain that you're here right now that spiritual part of god that's in you it's a part of spirituality [Music] back to oneness with god back to that oneness don't let that opportunity pass you by he's here this to have the faith and take that step but that can be you this morning you can go past being just convinced and there comes a time diego momento where the spirit was leading the lamb cuando el espirito giava al cordero the dove la paloma there had to be a conference between the lamb and the dove it was the dove that had to talk to the lamb it was about the lambs and the lamb young and beautiful life um is your love for that sinful that stinking world that you were born in a castle do you love them enough to forfeit your own life do you love them enough to take their place to bear [Music] such such a desperation but i'll drink no more i'll stop today like my master who died for me to make my way clear but that not my will but let it be your will whatever it costs in this conference this morning i say yodigo i want your holy spirit to live in me i've heard about lord jesus senor jesus [Music] your word has brought them here thus far and your word can take them all the way to the end father i put these people in your hands and you might in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen [Music] [Music] hey [Music]
