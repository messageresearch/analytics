to be in the house of the lord like i said if you would like we could turn to revelations 1 18. apocalypse whenever you have it just go ahead and say amen i had a plan yo continue on um the importance of reading our bible importance but i forgot it was going to be a good friday and i believe it's um duty-bound to come and speak about the greatest time on earth when our greatest enemy was conquered on that day it says i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forever ever more amen and have the keys of hell and death amen when moses asked god who do i tell the people that sent me who do i tell them who sent me a when abraham was i am abraham and here on this scripture jesus says i am he that liveth that's present tense that's today he lives today but i like what he says after that he said i am he that lives but i was dead yes and then he goes back to the present tense and says behold i am alive forevermore and i have not i did have but i have the keys of hell and death so let's go back past tense when he died amen but remember he is here right now amen let us bow our heads heavenly father father celestial lord we're so thankful for your holy spirit we're thankful for you working in each and every person that allows you to father god we come here unworthy father father but lord we come here knowing you paid the price lord and we come here with the sacrifice of our lord jesus christ under the blood asking for your perfect will this evening we ask that you take the full control lord we put ourselves into your hands in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated i would like to read john 3 16. i believe uh there's brothers here led by the lord there's some brothers that uh send me texts and this is one of the texts that they sent me today for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting amen amen what a beautiful message god has given us for god so loved the world that's why he died for us he was willing to die no jew no gentile nobody killed him he loved us so much that he came down himself so my title this evening is establishing the kingdom and i begin to think on how god began to create things on the earth because in his great mind he wanted to establish a kingdom for his children he wanted to have a paradise for us so that we can live and we could reign with him so he began to create all these things in the earth so that he could place his children on there brother branham says in the message satan's eden finally when he got it all made finally and finally we finally arrived with its headquarters of the earth in a beautiful spot laying east of the eden called the garden of eden god made the headquarters in the garden of eden is and over the whole situation he put his son and his son's wife over all of it that's right that's what god did he put him in full control they could speak to the winds and the wounds would cease to blow us they would speak to the tree and it would move from here to there they didn't but god gave them a warning in genesis 2 16 and 17 he told them and he says those this is he said and the lord god commanded the man saying every tree of the garden thou may mayest freely eat it but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for the day that thou eatest therefore thereof thou shalt surely die de la s that means he's going to make sure it happens it's we hear it and it sounds very harsh and very strong words surely die is but remember um though all of life has rules and laws of life right god gave them everything they wanted they had all the power that they had and they had unlimited fellowship with the lord companies in your but this one thing do not do or thou shalt surely die now death we've heard this before but there's two kinds of deaths in those classes the first one the spirit leaves the body and we lay the body to rest but then the second one is when the spirit of god separates from a person and we know the story i don't have to continue on with the story we know the punchline we know what adam and eve did eve she listened to a lie and everything fell apart and those two things begin to happen within them the death yes and gods put them together and he called for a conference of adam eve and the serpent and he told the serpent because you did this you'll be cursed over and he said i will put enmity um verse 15 i will put enmity between thee and thy woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and doubt shall bruise his heel esta erida but he said because you have done this verse 17 it says cursed be the ground it be the ground because you did this and sorrow shall be thou eat of all the days of thy life cursed be the ground maldito god cursed the serpent god cursed the woman but god cursed the ground when he talked to adam if i would if i was at him i'd be like i i got off on that one [Music] but that was the greatest curse what what were they created out of porque que fueron creados everything that you see the wood the trees the plants us have the 16 elements in them and that is made from the ground yes so when he said cursive in the ground the mountains changed the weather began to turn bad el tiempo oil climates begin to groan because it became separated from god man was separated from god which is the worst kind of death any man should have refused brother branham said man begin to be a wanderer around the earth because death began to set in porque introduced now the bible says in in genesis chapter 2 it says the day you eat thereof is the day you die so this is the first time we hear about death ever in in in the bible and what god basically was saying it says if you eat of this tree you will activate something is is dispatched or called out it was the first time death was mentioned where was it because there was no need of death amen amen where did it come from it's just a question maybe you guys can go and look at it and see where there was life death was there inside everything that has life in it now there is already a appointed time it's there along [Applause] um the the devil was in the garden diablo now he was stripped of everything that he had and he was hiding in the serpent he had no power in him he was stripped of all dignity he he did not have anything to fight with what is the devil what what's his power what is he good at diablo the bible says he's a deceiver the bible says that he's an accuser he's a good lawyer that's what it sounds like hey so he said if i could persuade them then i can put them under this. and i could put them under all of that and cause them to relinquish their power and that's exactly what happened yes he took away everything from adam and eve and he caused adam to forfeit the title deed he caused him to forfeit uh the inheritance that god had given him and and that's what exactly what happened yes exactly on that day on calvary in the mental says i disagree with the universities saying that satan will be saved he sinned and he is the originator of sin el peco el fue el que originol pecado so where does sin come from it comes from him how does how was death introduced that's why death has a grip on each and every person each and everything across the world because sin was introduced and sin activated death wherever it was whatever it was doing if it existed it was there when they sinned is that spirit shall be totally annihilated nothing to be left of it when sin struck the earth back in the beginning like a black sheep falling from the heavens it literally paralyzed the earth creature on earth and all of god's creation in bondage man was under bondage of death sickness troubles and sorrows and all nature fell with it was an anesthetic and actually paralyzed the earth creature on earth was subject to it and everyone born on earth was subject to it romans 5 14 it says nevertheless death reigned from adam to moses even over them that had not sinned after the multitude of adam's transgression who is a figure of him that was to come santa reynolds the devil established his kingdom el diablo establishing and death begin to reign over the people and we're subject under this there's nothing a person can do no persona brother burnham said that the uh abraham isaac jacob they were wanderers seeking a city to come but within all of this bondage that was going on there was whispers and there was prophecies going on throughout the scripture prophecy even within the judgment when he had the serpent eve and adam they're with him they were sitting there at the judgment seat and within that curse of the serpent god begin to prophesy of something good and his heel would bruise the head of that serpent and that was the first prophecy of what was to come yes even though the all of the old testament was shadowed with death there was light pointing to someone something was going to happen the second death and the first death was upon each and every person which was the separation from the spirit and they were gonna die eventually they could not enter into his presence they could not go and talk to him face to face and the effect of separation from a spirit effect causes rebellion causes hatred causes all those things because god implemented a sacrifice he said they said would sacrifice goats rams lambs and and uh and pigeons and doves sacrifice and it would cover their sin yes but they were still separated from that holy spirit so their nature was the things of the world the things of sin because of that separation of the spirit they they could not fellowship or they could not truly serve the lord so you see the whole world falling into pieces but god chose a certain people pueblo that was the jews he chose them so that he could redeem the world through them and god would go and lead them and do what he had to do through them but just like the world just like everybody else asico mundo yes [Music] and there finally god raised up david finally david and solomon the greatest the golden ages of until the last king wouldn't hear the prophets of attention full of sin full of death full of hatred of the audio full of lust of money lust of things that's what happened when death entered in it's a horrible thing and because of that babylon came and they they captured them and destroyed the kingdom and then we we see a picture of nebuchadnezzar who who remembers the dream nebuchadnezzar had cuantos he couldn't he couldn't understand what that dream dream meant so finally daniel comes in finally and he interprets that dream and it was a dream of a great image he had a head of gold he had a chest and arms of silver denial he had legs of iron or he had a waste of brass and dave or daniel begin to interpret this dream daniel and he said this is the gentile kingdom after the last kingdom failed god um the last kingdom of the jews it was the kingdom of the gentiles that took over era el reyno de los gentiles dominar and the gold was nebuchadnezzar i believe the silver was persia a la plata representable brass was greece iron was rome roma and the mix was rome and and produces prodigies it was a mix and that was from that time all the way to now yes that image is still being built or is showing itself indeed the way these people they built their kingdoms who knows of alexander the great they would go and they would conquer cities they would they were with blood on in on their shields the way they became kings was was uh by force it was by power it was by fear alexander the great would come in everybody was afraid that's how they built their kingdoms they were separated from god they didn't know anything else all they knew was death and and that's how the gentile kingdoms were were established and made all the way to today foreign [Music] hearing all the stories of what they did but i want you to notice that all these kingdoms made one image showing that there was one true ruler of them there was one image of all these kingdoms even though the kingdoms would would defeat one another he was ruling over everybody and the world is his now el mundo esta it's his kingdom now the devil is the ruler el diablo he said as you look a stone was caught by no man by no human hand commodity como puede and it struck the image on its feet of iron and clay and broke them into pieces then the iron the clay the bronze the silver the gold all together were broken pieces and became the chaff of summer threshing floors foreign and the wind carried them away and there was not a trace of them could be found but the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth and verse 44 he interprets what that stone was and in the days of those kings the god of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed nor shall the kingdom be left to another it shall break into pieces all of these kingdoms and bring them to an end and it shall stand forever that said that one would come down to destroy sin okay destroy the one that caused it and destroyed everything that sin caused the jews have been waiting for that loss they were waiting for that messiah to come they're waiting for for a savior to come they were already in bondage for so many years and maybe they were waiting for a king as bloody as david they maybe they were waiting for a king that was greater than alexander alejandro maybe they're waiting for a king that was more terrible than nebuchadnezzar brother branham says in the signs of his coming uh now this is john telling the pharisees juan hablando finally you have the foreigner of that coming of the lord standing out here he said he will thoroughly purge the his floor he will gather up the wheat into his garner and he will sweep her clean he will burn the chaff and with unquenchable fire olympia lapaja the bible says there was no beauty that we should desire of him he was a man of sorrow acquainted with grief that's who came is people were waiting for a great alexander lagentes alejandro look at how all these men they established their kingdom [Applause] and i could see that image who is that image it's it's nothing but the devil nothing but satan within all these these kingdoms saying this is the one you send he said the kingdom of god is at hand but he didn't come with all these great things he was clothed in humility that doesn't come with all of that but he comes all by himself at that time he didn't even have any followers he didn't even have generals he didn't have anybody to back him up but yet he was the king the king of all kings and he wasn't going to come by force he was going to come with atomic bombs what kind of kingdom is this what kind of upside down kingdom is this that is going to come with weakness that if somebody slapped you in the face you turned the other cheeks where you forgive your enemies how is he going to tear down this great image he didn't have no beauty that we should desire just like goliath when he saw david walk up to him you're sending this little boy did you say is you're sending this little thing to conquer me i stopped probably said he's no one better than than adam and and abraham because i'm the one that reigns death is the one that reigned over everybody he didn't even use any any power all he used was his words and finally the devil got him through the jews and he says we are going to kill him we are going to do the same exact thing we did to isia the same we did to jeremiah the same we did to john the baptist the son of man going up there they roved him with with kingly clothes they bowed their knee and mocked him apostles he was about to establish the greatest kingdom that has ever lived whenever he came he came on a white donkey albino el bino blanco and they said hosanna hosanna the king the son of david and there him walking to calvary people laughing at him some crying la gente he said you shouldn't be weeping for me you should weep for yourselves that you have your children you should weep for yourselves because this whole kingdom is going to be turned upside down he says no man taketh my life he says i have power to lay it down no wonder the bible says for god so loved the world time that's when he said it's time for me to give my life he had control of the situation and at jesus's worst hour jesus yellow was the most glorious hour fuel or gloriosa because when the sting of death began to go upon the son of man every blow that the devil gave him diablo jesus would take his power jesus jesus would take the power back from him every strike that he gave his back everything he did to him jesus begin to take the power back from the devil jesus his most shameful day from because jesus he didn't do it like like george washington or george washington didn't do it like alexander all these other kings he clothed himself with humility [Music] god says you shall surely die you shall surely i'll make sure you die i'll i'll be there when you die because he said surely he said it's gonna happen and that was the word of the lord yes and every price of death is on our head now he went to establish his kingdom and he said you know what this is how i'm going to establish it this is how i'm going to free my people this is how i'm going to defeat the enemy the only way you can get rid of death is [Music] i'm going to take their sins upon me and he put it upon us he put his love upon us and he covered us and when the devil thought he had him he said i can't believe he he fell for this i can't believe we have this man that calls himself the son of god in our hands oh remember whenever you killed abraham [Music] and this man is nothing less than any of those and people yelling and screaming saying if you're the son of god get yourself out of there today other ladies crying saying oh god why is was in control the whole time jesus is but he wasn't full of blood like david was or alexander all these other kings it was his own blood it was his own blood shedding on calvary for the human race he just didn't say god loved him god loves you he said i cannot stand to see my children the way they are i so love them what can i do i'll go down there myself finally whenever the devil had him the sting the stinger of death went in him the bee says i got him death said i got him people say that a bee can only stink once in reality it that's not true these are meant to sting other insects foreign but whenever they go to a great mammal or a human being when he pulls but whenever he went and he tried to kill the son of man the savior of the world and then whenever he got out that stinger stayed in that son of man and jesus took away the power of death from him on that day on calvary and maybe he was telling the devil something's wrong something's not right something didn't work the way it used to be and the devil says okay hold on hold on i'm hearing footsteps coming down from my door and whenever he opens the door it was jesus christ it was here full of power full of glory you know the gloria what was he doing he was taking the keys of death and howl back i'm establishing my kingdom i'm taking back the kingdom the power of death is sin jesus is there in that board meeting he says you know what i have the keys i'm i'm the one that calls the shots now i'm the one that decides yo el que voya let me see nope he's covered by the blood no my record show is clean your record show she's she's forgiven me he has the power now will be sitting there with the king. and he'll go with death and hell and they'll have to stand before him the bible says and the bible says that he takes them and throws him into the lake of fire he throws don't be afraid of the lake of fire that's god's own fire this is is the only one that can create an annihilation the same one that died on calvary brother branham or the bible says that was the second death he freed us from depression he freed us from sickness that's what the kinsmen redeemer does he redeems the land he redeems the people [Applause] no somos dinos but lord because you died on that cross each and every person sitting here tonight i could say i am a child of god and you rose up the third day father [Music] [Music]
