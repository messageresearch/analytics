[1:02:06] amen and amen amen amen amen you may be
[1:02:10] seated
[1:02:13] my title this this morning
[1:02:17] is uh seek the lord with all your heart
[1:02:23] to seek him with all your heart
[1:02:28] you know that word seek
[1:02:32] it's it's an action it's an action
[1:02:35] it's a verb it's a work
[1:02:39] but but within these scriptures
[1:02:44] grace is wrapped in this whole scripture
[1:02:46] la gracias
[1:02:59] but but it's grace that causes us to
[1:03:02] seek him
[1:03:05] this is an invitation this morning
[1:03:10] seek the lord seek the lord while he may
[1:03:14] be found
[1:03:40] you know what the bible says
[1:03:55] the bible says in romans 3 10.
[1:03:59] as it is written there is none righteous
[1:04:03] no not one
[1:04:04] no no there is none that understands
[1:04:09] there is none that seeketh
[1:04:13] after god
[1:04:16] man does not seek after god
[1:04:19] we are not capable of seeking after him
[1:04:24] so it's a strange invitation that god
[1:04:27] has given us
[1:04:31] to seek after him
[1:04:35] even though our very nature is against
[1:04:37] seeking the lord
[1:05:21] it should have been adam running up and
[1:05:23] down in the garden crying
[1:05:25] father father we're out now
[1:05:32] but it was god going through the garden
[1:05:34] crying adam
[1:05:35] adam where art
[1:05:41] and adam was hiding and
[1:05:45] that's his nature today
[1:05:57] behind something and they're still doing
[1:05:59] it
[1:06:09] that's that's an amazing thing right
[1:06:11] there
[1:06:13] that has grace all over it
[1:06:30] where are they as soon as we sin
[1:06:36] sinners and and no good people nosotros
[1:06:39] como pecadores
[1:06:40] buenos paranada god's reaction isn't to
[1:06:43] cast us away
[1:06:44] la raxion de god's immediate action was
[1:06:48] to seek his fallen son
[1:06:53] that's grace of god today
[1:06:57] that he would come and he would look for
[1:06:59] us
[1:07:02] even though we had no desire
[1:07:05] we had no desire to look for him
[1:07:10] to serve him but but the message
[1:07:14] of the hour tells us
[1:07:17] that god put a thirst in every single
[1:07:20] man and woman
[1:07:23] and i believe that he put a thirst in
[1:07:26] every single thing on this earth
[1:07:31] that the earth is thirsting
[1:07:35] for god and god put a thirst in each and
[1:07:39] every person
[1:07:54] we know that this invitation
[1:07:57] is included to all people on earth
[1:08:03] seek after god yet it's only for a
[1:08:07] certain group
[1:08:13] and the world is deceived by those
[1:08:15] things
[1:08:18] but the question is my brother's sister
[1:08:22] tonight
[1:08:35] what makes them crave to
[1:08:40] what makes them uh makes the american
[1:08:43] people smoke cigarettes
[1:08:47] when readers digest said that a hundred
[1:08:50] and thirty thousand
[1:08:51] is doomed um this year of smoking
[1:08:54] cigarettes
[1:08:56] elections
[1:09:03] but they do it anyhow embargo
[1:09:07] a cancer
[1:09:11] cancer a bottle of turbul turbo lurker
[1:09:16] if you see the cancer arrasando
[1:09:35] if the devil can't get you um all
[1:09:37] twisted up
[1:09:38] with something like that then he'll try
[1:09:41] to
[1:09:41] hide yourself under some church or some
[1:09:43] creed or some denomination
[1:09:58] but what makes man to do it in the first
[1:10:00] place
[1:10:15] there's a little place in his heart that
[1:10:18] nothing will
[1:10:19] fill it but god i exist
[1:10:27] and men are thirsting for something and
[1:10:29] that
[1:10:30] real thirst is for god
[1:10:37] so so when you see man out in the bar
[1:10:40] rooms
[1:10:43] when you see people uh cussing and
[1:10:45] sinning and doing all those things
[1:10:50] it's a thirst for god
[1:10:54] they're trying to quench a thirst
[1:10:57] [Music]
[1:11:09] why because their whole nature is
[1:11:11] against god
[1:11:14] they're thirsting for something and
[1:11:18] they're running here and there
[1:11:20] is looking for something
[1:11:24] to
[1:11:49] except the father which has sent me draw
[1:11:52] him
[1:12:01] i believe that's a separate calling to
[1:12:03] the thirst that god given people
[1:12:06] questions
[1:12:19] all men have a thirst for god
[1:12:24] but no man can come
[1:12:27] to him unless the father draws
[1:12:33] oh man look and and fight to find
[1:12:36] something to satisfy their souls
[1:12:42] their their ambition is so great so
[1:12:44] ambition
[1:12:46] that they create businesses and become
[1:12:48] billionaires
[1:12:51] and they try to be the greatest in the
[1:12:53] world
[1:12:55] and it'll never quench the thirst in
[1:12:57] sight
[1:13:00] but they will never turn but
[1:13:51] you your whole nature your whole nature
[1:13:54] is the other way
[1:13:55] us
[1:14:08] and your nature begins to seek after god
[1:14:12] is
[1:14:18] before anything can happen out here to
[1:14:21] make you a
[1:14:22] christian something has to happen in
[1:14:24] your heart to turn you to christianity
[1:14:26] and
[1:14:54] this side of
[1:15:35] if you're not seeking for the almighty
[1:15:37] god
[1:15:40] if there's something that called you
[1:15:44] if there was something that that pulled
[1:15:46] you and draw to you
[1:15:50] then you can find god in church
[1:15:54] or you can find god in your car
[1:15:57] you can find god in the wilderness
[1:16:01] you'll be able to find god us
[1:16:18] i remember a few weeks back
[1:16:21] but brother johnny was speaking about
[1:16:24] grace
[1:16:27] and and he said if we have grace this is
[1:16:30] gracia it's because or if we have faith
[1:16:32] i'm sorry
[1:16:35] it's because god bestowed grace upon us
[1:16:39] gracias if there's anything in me
[1:16:43] to have faith in the lord
[1:17:14] god is the one that starts your faith
[1:17:18] no man can come to me
[1:17:22] unless the father which has sent me
[1:17:24] draws him
[1:17:28] and that that scripture is just full of
[1:17:30] grace
[1:17:33] it's got four verbs in it
[1:17:36] it's got four actions in that tenet
[1:17:40] it has
[1:18:20] [Music]
[1:18:29] it's all by grace no man can come to me
[1:18:33] unless the father which has sent
[1:18:34] me almost
[1:18:38] draws
[1:18:49] unless the father which has sent me has
[1:18:52] drawn
[1:18:58] do you have a desire for the lord
[1:19:02] ask yourself today does
[1:19:05] anyone desire
[1:19:21] you in you
[1:19:24] cannot have a desire for the lord
[1:19:28] possible it's impossible it's impossible
[1:19:31] to love the lord it's impossible
[1:19:34] so the very
[1:19:37] means that god has already called you
[1:19:41] signification that god has already drawn
[1:19:43] you in question
[1:19:46] and you have to remember that it is
[1:20:15] and god not want you idiots if you
[1:20:18] desire him
[1:20:20] if you want more of the lord it's
[1:20:23] because god has already called you
[1:20:27] god has already dragged you in
[1:20:31] amen amen now now brother branham says
[1:20:35] this
[1:20:36] is god speaks to your nature
[1:20:41] or god speaks sorry
[1:20:44] and your nature begins to seek after god
[1:20:50] uh david says in in psalm 27.
[1:21:12] and your nature begins to seek after the
[1:21:14] lord
[1:21:17] god begins to speak to your heart
[1:21:21] maybe you've never you never read these
[1:21:23] scriptures before
[1:21:27] but these scriptures are being
[1:21:29] manifested in your life
[1:21:33] they're being made alive in your lives
[1:21:38] you begin to thirst after god
[1:21:54] amen amen it's god speaking to you
[1:21:58] it's god saying adam out of her heart
[1:22:04] it's god trying to pull his children
[1:22:07] back to his bosom
[1:22:21] when god calls men and women
[1:22:36] therefore when man realized he was
[1:22:39] separated from his god
[1:22:45] he become a wanderer they wept
[1:22:49] they cried they toiled
[1:23:18] he becomes a wanderer
[1:23:23] if i could get into the presence of god
[1:23:28] i could talk it all over with him
[1:23:32] that we become wonders thirsting for him
[1:23:38] now now my question is
[1:23:42] if god is the one seeking man
[1:24:57] paraque because because god doesn't want
[1:25:00] somebody
[1:25:02] that is half-hearted
[1:25:07] god doesn't want somebody to walk into
[1:25:09] his presence one day and walk out
[1:25:24] that he gets the wholehearted christians
[1:25:29] and that's why this invitation is not
[1:25:33] for the whole world
[1:25:36] yes he spoke to the whole world
[1:26:05] you know whenever you seek with all your
[1:26:07] heart
[1:26:09] that takes all of you
[1:26:13] not just 50 50. no no no
[1:26:17] not just 99 percent of you no
[1:26:36] because when you seek after him with
[1:26:38] your whole heart
[1:26:41] that is when you find him esc
[1:26:47] and tomorrow they're finished
[1:26:56] he's hiding himself from me i guess he
[1:26:58] doesn't want anything to do with me
[1:27:30] and ye shall
[1:28:11] it takes a death and life
[1:28:26] but you
[1:28:46] until you stop uh wanting to listen to
[1:28:49] those things that you listen to
[1:28:53] one day it'll be too late
[1:28:59] [Music]
[1:29:21] it's not for the one that looks good in
[1:29:23] church
[1:29:26] you're the one that will put his whole
[1:29:28] heart and soul after seeking god
[1:29:34] it's for those that will look and seek
[1:29:36] is
[1:30:04] you'll
[1:30:18] it's
[1:30:33] lord and you will find him
[1:30:37] amen amen the bible says
[1:30:41] hebrews 11 6. it's impossible to please
[1:30:46] him
[1:30:50] for he that cometh to god
[1:30:55] must believe that he is is necessary
[1:30:59] and that he is a rewarder to them that
[1:31:02] diligently
[1:31:03] seek him yes
[1:31:06] when you seek him believe that you'll
[1:31:10] find him
[1:31:12] when you look for him believe that
[1:31:27] whenever we get to that place
[1:31:31] you will see god manifested us
[1:31:36] you won't see god just in the scriptures
[1:31:40] you won't see him just in church when
[1:31:42] somebody is singing a beautiful melody
[1:31:44] or someone's preaching
[1:31:50] he will be manifested in your life
[1:31:54] desperation brings god in the scene yes
[1:32:09] knock and it shall be opened
[1:32:13] as can you it shall be received
[1:32:16] seek and ye shall fight then he begins
[1:32:20] to say
[1:32:26] that means it's a continuation
[1:32:28] significant continuation
[1:32:30] it means just don't sink for one day
[1:32:34] continually looking for the lord
[1:32:52] amen amen brother branham says
[1:32:55] this is then i got to thinking on
[1:32:58] perseverance
[1:33:02] and i thought yes many men is
[1:33:05] perseverance
[1:33:20] you
[1:33:48] and then we go into our busy life
[1:33:53] the devil loves to make our lives busy
[1:33:55] el diablo
[1:33:59] busy busy doing this and now
[1:34:02] and forgetting
[1:34:16] until
[1:34:29] until you get your blessings
[1:34:32] received the holy ghost you receive your
[1:34:36] healing
[1:34:38] have you shot for the lord violently
[1:34:44] crying out
[1:35:30] let us turn to romans nine
[1:35:33] romanos nueve
[1:35:36] 9 10 2 9 verses 10 to 13.
[1:35:40] capitol
[1:35:51] but when rebecca had also conceived by
[1:35:53] one
[1:35:54] even by our father isaac
[1:36:00] for the children being not yet born
[1:36:03] neither having
[1:36:04] um having done any good or evil
[1:36:12] that the purpose of god according to
[1:36:14] election might stand
[1:36:15] not of works but him that call it
[1:36:24] it was said unto her the elder shall
[1:36:27] serve
[1:36:29] the younger celebijo
[1:36:33] and it is written jacob i have loved but
[1:36:36] esau
[1:37:02] you know god gave mercy to both children
[1:37:08] did you know that god gave an
[1:37:11] opportunity to both
[1:37:12] allo but but god
[1:37:17] gave grace gracia by election poor
[1:37:21] election
[1:37:21] to jacob even before they were born
[1:37:27] he said the elders shall serve the
[1:37:29] younger this
[1:37:32] but whenever they
[1:37:46] the most amazing thing in the old
[1:37:48] testament
[1:37:53] which was the birthright
[1:37:57] brother branham says he said amanda
[1:37:58] branham um
[1:38:01] he said now what is the birthright
[1:38:05] that's what i'm trying to tell you now
[1:38:08] this holy spirit is your birthright es
[1:38:11] espiritu santo es su primo
[1:38:13] that's your birthright is a supreme
[1:38:15] genitura it's your god-given right
[1:38:19] so here today our birthright
[1:38:22] is the holy spirit
[1:38:26] but what was the significance of the
[1:38:28] natural birthright
[1:38:31] significance
[1:38:35] now this is amazing as the firstborn
[1:38:39] asicomo
[1:38:40] el primogenito esau was in the direct
[1:38:43] line
[1:38:44] director of the unconditional covenant
[1:38:47] that god had with abraham in the sea
[1:38:52] he saw everything pertained to esau
[1:38:56] our
[1:39:10] and blessed is everyone to to everyone
[1:39:12] else that blesses you
[1:39:16] that blood that that promise was to
[1:39:20] abraham and his seed
[1:39:23] everything god gave to abraham
[1:39:38] c era
[1:39:42] imagine the the beauty of it
[1:39:46] knowing that one day someone threw
[1:39:49] through
[1:39:50] my lineage a
[1:40:17] every shadow and every type of christ
[1:40:31] he should have been the father of nate
[1:40:33] or he should have been
[1:40:34] uh israel israel
[1:40:37] he should have had the 12 tribes
[1:40:44] right he was the firstborn
[1:40:48] he but
[1:41:02] how beautiful is that that the
[1:41:05] birthright you were linked to jesus
[1:41:07] christ
[1:41:11] through you jesus christ
[1:41:15] and save all mankind
[1:41:19] through him the promise should have came
[1:41:21] out of traffic
[1:41:25] now let me ask you a question
[1:41:28] when you're born again what
[1:41:44] what promises
[1:42:04] when jesus christ comes a change of body
[1:42:07] pertains to you yeah
[1:42:09] jesus a thousand years and kingdom
[1:42:13] pertains to you
[1:42:14] milan if you have the birthright
[1:42:20] you can look back to when jesus died
[1:42:25] and when he rose up again
[1:42:40] it's linked
[1:42:55] you'll you'll sacrifice that to to hang
[1:42:58] out with friends and to
[1:42:59] listen to certain music
[1:43:07] we sell our birthright for for little
[1:43:10] things that will
[1:43:11] satisfy the flesh just for a moment
[1:43:17] when that birthright is linked to
[1:43:22] eternity
[1:43:48] but having the grace of god
[1:44:02] the bible says that the older shall
[1:44:05] serve the younger the is
[1:44:08] so he lived off of the revelation of the
[1:44:11] world
[1:44:16] even though i'm the younger one
[1:45:24] you cannot compare it with anything else
[1:45:40] you will never find the holy ghost
[1:46:10] when i serve the lord better yeah
[1:46:13] stop comparing the birth right
[1:46:18] with a bowl of soup
[1:46:23] his natural hunger natural was greater
[1:46:26] than his spiritual thirst
[1:46:29] spiritual what are you hungering for
[1:46:33] what are you desiring in life
[1:46:36] to be great say grande do i have a lot
[1:46:38] of money
[1:46:40] do you have a legacy are you comparing
[1:46:43] that to your birthright
[1:46:47] think about it think about what you're
[1:46:50] doing today
[1:47:06] this is what i realized
[1:47:48] how is that possible it comes you could
[1:47:51] sell it
[1:47:55] but you can't buy it for a million
[1:47:56] dollars
[1:47:59] you can't buy it for the whole world
[1:48:16] you cannot go back and say lord lord
[1:48:19] i'll do all this for you i'll do this
[1:48:21] i'll work
[1:48:22] so that i can receive my salvation it'll
[1:48:24] never work
[1:48:30] i'll give all my money i'll give all
[1:48:32] everything everything i have
[1:48:34] to receive your salvation and it'll
[1:48:36] never work
[1:48:41] because it's by grace
[1:48:47] seek the lord or
[1:48:50] isaiah 55 6 and he says
[1:48:53] seek the lord while he may be found
[1:49:11] see every single thing in this earth
[1:49:16] has the potential to be found
[1:49:20] did you know that maybe you'll never
[1:49:23] find it okay
[1:49:24] but if a man gets a treasure chest with
[1:49:26] billions
[1:49:39] maybe they'll never find it but it has
[1:49:42] the potential
[1:49:45] to be found because it's there
[1:49:48] it's there waiting there's only one
[1:49:51] thing
[1:49:53] that that can
[1:50:03] when god hides himself from the people
[1:50:08] it doesn't matter how much they seek no
[1:50:10] importa
[1:50:12] and how much they look hey he
[1:50:15] will never be found
[1:50:19] that's why we've got a space of grace
[1:50:22] today
[1:50:35] god gives us the potential to find him
[1:50:39] potential if we seek with all of our
[1:50:42] hearts
[1:50:46] began to search for it
[1:50:50] there was one time avionics that that
[1:50:53] isaac
[1:50:54] he said i'm getting old my eyes are
[1:50:58] dimming
[1:50:59] he said before i die he saw go and and
[1:51:03] go catch venison
[1:51:06] on the field and come and and serve it
[1:51:09] to me
[1:51:13] and i will bless you
[1:51:17] so he saw ghost i said
[1:51:19] [Music]
[1:51:32] he was a no good person brother brown
[1:51:34] says
[1:51:36] but this invitation isn't for the good
[1:51:39] bro
[1:51:41] it's for those who will desire him with
[1:51:43] all their hearts
[1:51:46] it's for those who
[1:52:08] and he goes and he says lord or father
[1:52:11] here
[1:52:11] here am i regressive
[1:52:14] and
[1:52:23] the bible says that isaac began to
[1:52:25] tremble he said
[1:52:28] because he gave the birth or the
[1:52:30] blessing to
[1:52:32] to jacob
[1:52:36] and he began to tell the son
[1:52:39] he said i'm sorry but i already gave the
[1:52:42] blessing to your younger brother
[1:52:47] and the bible says that esau begin
[1:52:51] to to seek the lord
[1:52:54] he sought for the birthright
[1:53:16] you have a little bit of blessing left
[1:53:18] for me
[1:53:22] but the door was shut the time of
[1:53:25] seeking of the lord was done with
[1:53:28] el tiempo and he was shut off
[1:53:34] the bible says that he found no
[1:53:38] repentance
[1:54:06] if you have
[1:54:20] in question and answers he asked brother
[1:54:22] branham this question
[1:54:26] i have lived many years in sin until i
[1:54:29] found the lord
[1:54:34] please brother branham i have sinned
[1:54:36] again
[1:54:39] i'm not worthy to come before you this
[1:54:42] in this holy place
[1:54:46] please tell me if i can be restored
[1:54:49] whole again
[1:54:53] brother branham says yes
[1:54:57] you have not sinned
[1:55:02] so far in god that you could be restored
[1:55:10] you you uh if you had sinned far you
[1:55:13] could not be restored
[1:55:58] ghost you desire god
[1:56:02] shows that god dropped the lifeline down
[1:56:05] to pick you up
[1:56:09] you have a desire for the lord
[1:56:12] it means god already dropped his
