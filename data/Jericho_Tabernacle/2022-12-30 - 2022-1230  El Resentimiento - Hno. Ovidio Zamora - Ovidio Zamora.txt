in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen know what I ordered [Music] chronometry I set a timer that way I don't go past my time and if I do go over my time I apologize okay Mateo in the Book of Matthew chapter 15. you can say verse 18. [Music] God's word says [Music] but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile the man OS is testimonials for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries fornications thefts false witness and blasphemous [Music] these are the things which to follow a man but to eat with unwashing hands default nothingman [Music] you may be Cedar Brothers and yeah so happens that the last time that Cesar spoke Hernandez Brothers on this last time he spoke when he started speaking he said he was very nervous and I told him never say that you're nervous because then you get the people nervous and now it turns out I'm I'm in a worse scenario than he is just for example I can't find my notes and those is [Music] well let's begin I couldn't find them we're going to do something different tonight just imagine we're at a high school a class at the at the University or a high school you're my students I'm going to choose now a very special student he's very bright and he's a good student and I'm gonna ask him a series of questions so I'm the teacher I'm the the professor here I'm gonna ask if I squeeze this orange what comes out of it orange juice can someone get them a mic okay and I would say can it be possibly grapefruit juice that can come out of it no they always what about apple juice no no he's right Anton says porque tiene why is it that orange juice has to come out of this amen it's what's on the inside already Bueno you answered every question correctly I'm gonna change it a bit now Nosotros now we this orange is now not the orange but it's mean this orange represents every one of us if I pressure if I put pressure if I squeeze it then what do you think will come out of it style intro what's on the inside so then when a person is pressured or they're squeezed then what comes out is the resentment all of you hatred Rancor grudges Envy in the Bible and so much more and tone says so therefore the IE from there sentimento we're going to speak a bit about resentment I wasn't going to mention this but yeah on Christmas and the day after we got two phone calls from two married women they're friends of the family yes one of them esposa spoke to my wife and she talked about what was happening in her marriage so what impacted me the most foreign it came to mind that scripture about Moses giving the writing of divorcement it was due to the hardness of the heart and I just thought that scripture was written there just because but when I heard that when she said I just have resentment and hatred and such a rage against him I hate him and I would ask myself why is it that a woman that initially fell in love has gone to that point that now she hates him so when the when my wife gave me the phone I didn't spend that much time talking to her and I just gave her a simple solution the Lord Jesus Christ as brother Louise spoke at the funeral foreign there's only one way you can get to see her again there's only one solution it's the Lord Jesus Christ we can't do anything without the Lord Jesus Christ two days afterwards I had a niece that called us is because in this holiday season and Christmas that's what the devil attacks the most with hatred I think that conversation lasted about two hours and she told us I've reached the breaking point there's no solution to this we're getting a divorce so seeing that they both made that decision the only thing that we advise them the parents is to separate themselves foreign there's no other solution when one of my daughters went through that that divorce happened because of her into this Mexico Papa then she said dad you have a look on me she talked to me I acknowledge that I was guilty and for him divorcing me but now I recognize that and I want to I want to resume my relationship with my husband three here so when I said I promise and I said I promise I'll talk to him to do everything that I can that way you can both get back together and I talked to him and he told me he would always call me Mr obedo there's nothing that can be done I've made my choice I'm not getting back with her they have two daughters this was something that happened around eight nine years ago and Thursdays so then I said here's where the rolls flipped the hardness of the heart was now in the woman the hardness is not always in the heart of man you say and I know they're here with us don't even think I'll mention names but here with us that that's something that has happened here that has happened here people have come with me to talk about the situation I've seen women the area foreign they treat the woman like trash like a doormat [Music] maybe somebody is already understanding what I'm talking about and I've realized that years go by and years go by e and the resentment is still there is the resentment is still embedded in them so I sincerely when I see those kinds of cases it's something that breaks my heart because I've seen women cry in front of me with their own tears coming out of their eyes telling me about their life and testimony and the treatment that they got from that man this here that's why there was a servant of God that would always say I recommend all the young sisters that are wanting to get married to look first for the new birth because when we get married we're in love my first marriage I got married when I was in love and then I got divorced she's already passed away the husband of my wife passed away as well and then we met up and we started our life together [Music] what I'm telling you is not only the message or in the Bible but it's something that's from my own life so when I married my current wife I said I will never get divorced again Phoenix and it so happens that we came to Phoenix in the message already and two of my children came with us then there was another one that came that now lives in Oklahoma so these young men made life impossible for my current wife those amendments [Music] so then there was a resentment that set in and that's why I keep mentioning the word resentment there was a resentment that came in there was a spirit that came in and I have my daughter here foreign did not love my children and she only loved her own children so we reached that stage I'm saying and I I said to her you know what no I'm sorry it was here we're going to get a divorce that's why when I see marriages that they both have children on both sides I pray for that marriage because I know what kind of issues both sides will have experience what I'm telling you are my own life experiences so I said to her [Music] an older one and a young one and they've grown up they even have kids and grandchildren now the issue is that I went with my pastor and I told him I'm going to get a divorce and he asked why are you getting divorced because of this this and this he says no you're not getting divorced because that's a demon and I'm going to pray for that demon to get out of you and he prayed for me and that demon did come out placed in my mind to get divorced Ure and by this time I was already in the message I was in usher in the church I felt really holy cow yeah I would even I I had some time preaching and then all of a sudden I wanted to get divorced but the devil's so tremendous that when you least expect it you're in his clutches why because he used your mind that she didn't love my children only she loved her own children even I would reject it back then it was about 25 30 years ago now she says she calls me dad I call her daughter I'm her dad because she was raised with me and her father already passed away we have a very beautiful relationship with the children and with my own children to this you listen your list you are Nemo so I encourage the marriages here that the husband has a son and the wife has her own child to not separate from the word and he's a dividing thing that comes among you come with your pastor foreign don't try to fix it on your own because you won't be able to fix it on your own I've seen marriages face to face one part is forgiving the other party does not want to accept the forgiveness it's better if they broke up they've broken up emotions I know there's a lot of sisters here that have gone through that they've Fallen and then they ask why do I have so much resentment maybe in the past it went through a case of adultery in their marriage and they forgave each other but you just simply forgave from your mouth and the other person forgives but not really from their heart is and they begin to live a life that seems normal but when a problem arises the woman or the husband she calls back that adultery that is already under the blood because it was already confessed your sin and it's like that drop of ink that drops into that tub of Clorox it vanishes as soon as you confess your sin you're so clean as white wall you confess your sin down at that moment you're forgiven now there was one [Music] I was going to leave it off to the end I was going to close with it but I'll mention it now oh no it was one this this orange his name was Jesus this Jesus foreign then what came out of him perdon forgiveness Mercy is and if that isn't what comes out of us then we need the Holy Spirit because that's the only solution is if you have if you have some sort of resentment if you've been having it for 20 30 years now you know what will happen to you you'll have cancer because you have tuberculosis leukemia because you carry that resentment will cause you a disease because it will physically affect you I won't read the scripture because it's too long I'll just remark it when David when David committed adultery with Bathsheba and you know the story already but the point is this there was a boy a child that was born from that adultery the Bible says that that God was not pleased with that with David because that woman was already married and the man was one of David's best soldiers and he sent him to the Forefront of the battle so that he could intentionally die and don't says so then David um he sent your rise to the the Forefront of the battle and he got killed once he died he tried to fix that issue he uh one with that woman he married her she now belonged to him and then time went on time went on and you know what happened [Music] I'll read this one and Psalms 32. was not confessing a sin us the whole time he was sick and sick and sick and falling and falling and falling until finally in Psalms 32 it says when I kept silence my bones wax old through my roaring all the day long for day and night thy hand was Heavy upon me he said my moisture is turned into the jaw of Summer but now here is the the solution whatever the problem is this is I acknowledge my sin uncity and my iniquity have I not hid I said I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord and thou forgive us the iniquity of my sin he forgave that adultery that he committed but yet he had to pay a price because the prophet Nathan told him the son you had he will have to die and that's how it happened the son he had died Aura now the well hello I'm going to read what the meaning of resentment from the dictionary is a moral pain that is produced as the outcome of an offense the person that suffers isn't able to forget that offense so therefore he begins to feel it one time after another he resents that's why it's resentment it's a sentiment that you feel again so it's you you it's a resentment you repeat the the feeling so 10 15 years ago bye and you still uh resent it and maybe you're still living with your husband but that life isn't life it's a it's a living hell and my daughter my wife or my daughter now that is divorced she said her life was a living hell yeah once we broke off the relationship I came back to life again I was myself again so this is this feeling goes along with grudges and hostility towards them caused the harm that's why the person can't heal that's why they can't heal because they're just turning one side to another on the same issue towards them that caused the harm now what is grudges it's a tenacious rooted resentment and resentment is connected to another kind of hatred like grudges that's why grudges are even worse than resentment but it's it's something that causes or is caused from the same thing graduates in Psychology we understand it's a very uh powerful feeling and deep persistente and nagging that is kept throughout time that is embedded in our inner being causing us to emotionally affect us on a negative scale and physically as well now remember David as long as he did not confess his sins so everything was going wrong he was getting sick his bones waxed old he was in drop but when he confesses physically Divine Healing came to him forgive me but this is how the Lord led me a very uh excruciating Grudge or intense Grudge can drive us to hatred now it's on hatred now [Music] now it's not only resentment it's hatred and the last term to describe it there's a need for vengeance if you did it to me I'll do it back to him if uh that way he can know who he's dealing with there's different negative feelings that arise because of it and they say constantly sentient it's understood in a classic way and it's understood in the classic way I foreign and it doesn't allow us to keep moving forward then the passion of resentment it consumes you physically stress why is there so much stress why is there so much sickness the more sin there is the more sickness there is but there is a solution Brothers of forgiveness that's the solution pero I am problema but there is a problem the foundation of Christianity is faith but faith it has its own base when you put the foundation you're not you're not going to put it on Sand you have to put it on a base so the foundation of faith is forgiveness is if you look at the Statue of a perfect man at the bottom of the pyramid you have three little lines justification sanctification sanctification and the new birth or the baptism of the Holy Ghost so then you can say for example how can I go to the altars so God can deliver me from this resentment if I have not been born [Music] if the person has not been born again they cannot overcome that resentment they can't why because they must forgive to go up towards Faith so when you're born again the love of Jesus Christ will come to your heart and the love of Jesus Christ resentment and can't hold grudges it can hate is the solution yes is environment the new birth Jesus Christ Jesus Christ in the person in the heart you can't even pray for someone else as long as you don't have the new birth if the Holy Ghost has not come to you you can't even pray for anyone else [Applause] yes everyone foreign and you can add more things to it Revenge and you can find all the consequences of that speaking about resentment the prophet says preach in 1953. this is the beginning of the fame of Jesus paragraph 32. he says there was a little baby with epilepsy he had a little shroud that was tied around pinned together and he was having a seizure right there on the on the platform the little kid the little child was and nevertheless there was a somewhat of a resentment he was able to catch a resentment [Music] like a minister at the public you can catch someone has resentment or someone has a certain feeling you can even catch it from up here he said you can feel it you can sense it in the back there was around 28 000 people that night move far away in the back there was a resentment that kept coming he says I looked up and it was a Ministry and it was around eight to ten of his people here and I told the Usher go they yes go and have that minister to Bow his head a moment afterwards and he said that Minister said yes this is a public worship place I don't have to bow my head Lord and I said uh mister so you're not going to Bow your head he said was still up with his face he was still up and I said we've been very well Americano that's your American privilege but remember I'm not to be held accountable and that little one that was having a strong seizure Celestial I said Heavenly Father foreign Lord we're very grateful with you that baby went off the platform with his mother and I heard a commotion and all the groups that was with this Minister worship we're suffering now with being irreverent to the prophet and to the word of God Aurora now Christo the Lord Jesus Christ taught us despite people insulting you hitting you spitting on you um humiliating you is receiving a spit from the drunk soldiers are pulling the hairs of his beards if someone has a beard just pull your beard you're going to see how how much it hurts I don't think anyone here has a beard right in those days so then solo respondio he just answered from perdon with forgiveness and even had mercy there on the powerful Center and that sinner was saying because he was reverent with the Lord now the question we should ask ourselves our own selves what is it that is coming out of me when I'm squeezed or when I'm pressured what is that comes out of me yeah yeah they must and moreover I'll be closing now Faith In Love are related they're relatives you can't have one without the other interface because you cannot have faith without having love if you have not been born again you cannot have love you cannot have faith you can't be set free from that demon of resentment because you can have faith with the happiness okay because your very faith is based on a god who's the mere essence of love so then faith and love work together that's why faith is based on love perfect on page number four of the message brother Brandon doesn't really talk much about that he just says if you cannot forgive you cannot have love you can't have faith and consequently you can't be sent free from that resentment that for so many years you carried with you and I'll close with this [Music] I had another commentary that was called the way down but I can't I'll just finish with these other two stories I took it from the book The Journey of Billy Graham if you don't have that book I I recommend that you get it it's called The Journey the journey a while ago a woman wrote me a lengthy letter wherein she spoke about how much she had so much bitterness against her ex-husband I understood her pain but then afterwards she mentioned okay that her divorce happened more than 20 years ago sadly this woman was a captive to the Past poisoned by the bitterness all these years for some people wrath and bitterness become part of their identity it's that that makes it even harder for them to get rid of their problems we can't change the past we can only seek God's forgiveness for the wrong things that we did but once the Lord has forgiven us shouldn't we also forgive which is the hardest thing to do don't let the past keep you captive yes take your bitterness and resentment and put them at the feet of the Cross Jesus said if the son indeed has set you free shall be free indeed John 8 36. That's The Power of forgiveness closing now there was another man that Billy Graham says that he wrote to him he said the man said it's the hardest thing that I've done but I feel like they took off a load of 500 kilos off of my back he spoke about the transforming power of forgiveness almost all weeks our people are writing to me telling me I cannot forgive me it's because you don't you simply don't know how much that person has hurt me this is something that might echo in your very thoughts but nevertheless there is nothing that will completely set us free from the past or open the door to reconciliation as forgiveness even though the other person would deny to accept any fault or will laugh at our forgiveness that should not hold us back Colossians 3 3. that's how we should forgive the others Hermanos so Brothers when you go to a river and you take water in your hands you can't drink the same water again and that same water that you want to grab is now floating Beyond so the pass is now passed we can't bring it back we can't fix the past where we messed up where we uh failed it's so beautiful to have that peace and not to hate anyone I don't hate anyone here I love everyone maybe there's someone that does not love me and I can see him that's not my problem though don't put it on me that's not my problem if they don't love me I love them that's their problems if they don't love me then they won't make it then they won't make it it's better to love and to forgive you know who benefits from it you know what the benefit is you know who's benefited the most the Persona the person that asked for the for the Forgiveness benefits the most for forgiveness you're free you're free you're not going to be like propheta you're not going to be like that ego in the case like the prophet saws that's how we are sometimes like eagles and cages until a prophet came and told us Johnny Crow what are you doing you're free now why are you just going in circles why are you going in circles in the past when someone comes and says did you forget what you were yes he says I don't know I don't live in the past anymore I don't dwell on the past anymore let them judge me or do whatever they want I'm not there I don't do it I'm free you can please stand foreign let us pray the prophet says I'm gonna give you one that will choke you know the baptism of the Holy Ghost will not indicate that you can go in at all not because of that yes that has nothing to do with your soul that's just the baptism see requiring remember that was ordained of God Hermanos so Brothers [Music] if you come to God wherever you are at this altar or in the altar of your heart in your car or at your home the prophet received the baptism of the Holy Ghost had a barn he wasn't even at church PLS used so ask God for him to help you to forgive her person okay the person that will benefit the most is yourself because you're going to forgive yourself [Music] Lord give him a total Deliverance If They Carried that thing from the past that does not let them they can't heal because of it [Music] which is the Lord Jesus Christ through the power of forgiveness surrender your life to the Lord Jesus Christ be born again you'll even fly the birds that are flying over you wherever Lord thank you and forgive me for this chopped up message thank you for taking away the nervousness that I had Lord gracias and I think my past of replacing is trust in me for tonight I ask that you be with all of my brothers may you bless them let them make their choice for you there still is a day left let us go into 2023. safe and free pass for the peace and being merciful to the Fallen that's the solution for resentment I thank you tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen [Music] hello power [Music] be Hind us [Music] [Applause] [Music] you're beautiful [Music] oh I'm away [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] you will hear before [Music] [Music] [Music] away [Music] there's no way to believe [Music] [Music] later [Music] forever [Music] [Music] I'm going away [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Mercy we grow my love oh mercy [Music] foreign [Music]

foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] his name is [Music] [Music] with my eyes [Music] now [Music] here [Music] oh we have recented the service but before we pray to this mess we do have Thanksgiving sister Francis Alanis thanks the Lord Jesus Christ for having answered a petition written last Friday or she asked for an emergency healing miracle the Lord answered and the person was rushed to the hospital where they had to amputate his foot up to the knee otherwise he would have lost his life since this was over a month old and his foot was rotting with a strong smell and he refused to attend attend to it somehow the Lord in the midst after having made the request and God answered the prayer is pasado attender [Music] [Music] laboration and the Lord is good to us we have a petition expectations is asking for prayer for her mother she is still at the hospital and we also have an unspoken prayer request from Sister Rose that is all that we have written is can you please
