may be seated amen my title tonight is what i am to be es and my subtitle is a potential subtitle um where i got my title from [Music] my title sounds a little um confusing i could have said what i'm going to be boy but i got this title from um brother branham's message things that are to be hey that's a tremendous message a message um that i i believe every person should listen to um because he speaks of the beginning of the principle he speaks of eternity he speaks of who we are now and he speaks of where we're going all the way back to eternity [Music] these things that are now our only potential estas on potential calling for the things that is to be amando so the things that are now our only potential potential are only potentially the things that are to be es potential so my title is what i am to be itos what every person every child of god is supposed to be and is going to be your potential is in you now you are the potential of what you're gonna be us potential is a dormant power potential it means the capable of development potential means hidden strength it's a power it has all the the abilities inside of it yeah but it's inactive it's dormant it needs to be activated and each and every person here tonight has potential potential today today uh is uh um youth service oh yes so i i want to direct this message to the youth says that every one of you have potential it doesn't matter what anybody tells you it doesn't matter how you look like it doesn't matter what they say in school about it it doesn't matter what they say at work it doesn't even matter what you think of yourself you have potential in you as a child of god you are born with eternal potential eternal it's a power that is hidden within you amen amen uh there's a quote that i i really enjoyed um brother branham would quote this colored sister unassita que verdado branham he says it in the message convince and then concerned like the old colored lady said brother i i want to give my testimony testimonial i said go ahead sister she said you know what she said i hate what i ought to be he said i ain't what i want to be no soy lo que quiro but one thing sure i know peru i ain't what i used to be and brother branham says so that's about good jose mourinho i'm not what i want to be no soil and i'm not what i i ought to be but i'm so glad that i'm not who i used to be and for every christian that has heard that quote we've received comfort by these these this quote and the words that actually give us the comfort las palabras consuelo is that i'm not who i used to be i'm not what i'm supposed to be but i know that i'm not what i used and everyone by by god's grace can honestly say this that i'm not what i used to be no soil can look back and say there is progress you can look back and say there was development you can look back and you say i have grown amen amen but but these words the the first words of this quote that say i'm not what i ought to be okay i'm you are not put in the finish in the finish line but you are placed on the starting point you're not who you used to be no it is amen amen praise god and it causes us to understand that we're barely in the beginning of our christian journey and i want to ask this question how did you become from what you used to be to who you are now by the grace of god by jesus christ not by our works if it was by my works i'd be farther from the lord than i'd ever be just but by my but by god's grace i'm not who i used to be so now we understand how we got to this point it's by god's grace by god's grace you are saved by god's grace you are here tonight i become more joyful listen to listening to these words i'm not what i'm supposed to be no solo and i'm not what i want to be but if it was by god's grace i am where i am now that's potential es potential every single person has potential in their lives today potential is something that you're not yet potential but it's that means there's more of god to be done in my life to need more of christ is a good thing amen amen i'm not what i ought to be no soil potential is uh is not what's already have been has already been done [Music] uh the easter seal preached in 1965. he said notice it's the earnest or potential potential quicken the quickening power of your resurrection when you receive the holy spirit that is then dwelling in you the potential of it and the potential of your rapture rapturing body is in you now when you receive the holy ghost so when somebody receives the holy ghost the potential of your resurrection is in you now don't amen amen this is what brother branham says estella christian and uh this is the exposition of the seventh church age book uh and the of the sardinian sardisian age and the way that it is done was by god's perfect will and programming the lutherans had the holy ghost potentially under justification los luteranos which means that you accepted jesus christ as your personal savior you're still struggling with things of the world maybe you're sanctified and the things of the world are out of you yeah you don't have the holy spirit but brother branham says potentially you already have the holy ghost see you're not a seed when you receive the holy ghost we didn't become seed we didn't become predestinated seed when we received the holy ghost we always were see you were without even having the holy ghost brother branham said continues in the exposition of the seven church ages he said we did not become seed by the rebirth he we were seed and therefore we were reborn for only the elect can be reborn hold this carefully in mind now take the next step redeems to redeem means to buy you back it restores to the original owner by his death shed shed blood brought back his own poros he bought back the spoken word seed bride el compro de regreso la simiente la novia de la palabra romans 8 30 romano trent for moreover whom he predestinated porque los glorificator you know what predestined means before pre means in front very significant pre means in the beginning so when he created each and every child of god he pre-made you el te prejiso he made you with your beginning and your end already el te is going to proceed to finn he made you with everything that you need for the journey he made it inside you now when he created you he already put your future inside amen amen let's turn to genesis 1 11. the bible says and let us and god said let us bring forth grass and herb grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so despues produced and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself whose seed was in itself after his kind and god saw that it was good produced everything that that seal needed he already put inside of it if i give you a seed if i give you an acorn what do you see quebec do you see just an ugly brown seed cafe or do you see the potential of it oh wow i can plant it in the back of my yard and it could be a big beautiful tree and it could give me shade and i could put a swing on it but yet you're still looking at a seed when god oh that person is never going to get right when people see your your faults and your your your wrong doings they don't see the potential they don't see the power behind you they don't when the pharisees walked up to jesus they saw him they said he's a drunkard he he's he's a uh uh uh what was it that he called him they called him a devil that's oh this girl she'll never get right oh my god oh no they they'll won't pass school no no no oh they don't have any future yet inside of them is all the potential inside of them is eternal life and all they're looking at is the seed but you allow that seed to be planted but it will grow a tree with more seeds and those seeds have more trees yes and when god created those trees from the beginning [Music] and sometimes it feels like you were buried to die but don't worry there's life inside you and you'll go through all those trials and tribulations and they saw all ugly things under heaven that he was the alpha alpha he was the omega omega he was the beginning and he is the ending and he says that he was he he says he was um which was which is and which is to come you know what that means that he had predestination inside of it from beginning to end was inside of one man and inside of you is alpha and omegas it's the predestined it's up to us to bring it out he said if jesus christ was here tonight he couldn't do any more for you he couldn't heal you why because he already did it it's up to you now it's up to your faith so that you can pull that potential down you pull that power of healing amen amen brother branham says in the message god's power to transform this element now god put the seed in there with the potentials that it would be what he said it would be para potencial que and puedes long as it stays in the right category it would be just exactly what god said it would be based it had to be that way denia caceres because he made it that way and he made a channel that anything that stays in the channel in the line of his word it will bring forth exactly like his word said it would do this it cannot move from there it's channeled just exactly right [Music] and each one of those seeds has power in itself to transform itself into the species that i desire it to be but salir de si mismo in its potentials now to make it out of itself exactly what i want it to be where where is the transforming power the to transform you from a justified state to the holy ghost where is it what church is it is brother branham says he put that transforming power in every scene and you have the power to transform within yourself he's given that to you when god told adam he told him to multiply that was his commission he had all the potential in him he had everything inside of him to achieve god's purpose but because of sin death more than multiplication [Music] the bible says in john 12 24 and juan dos very early i say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into a ground to the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit he multiplied billions multiplico biones he multiplied eternal life multiplicola because that is the commission and god rested after the fulfillness of that seed came to pass that seed god has eternity within that seed within you and it's up to you what you're going to do with that potential potential i don't know if you remember that story the story of the king that gave his servants the talents he gave one five talents he gave one two talents and he gave the other one talent and the bible says he gave it to them according to their abilities god will give you a purpose but he'll give you the potential to fulfill that purpose whatever if it might be bringing two souls to christ whether it might be raising a little pastor so he gave them every talent according to their abilities one five one two and the other one and when he came back the one with five he doubled his talents instead of giving him the five that he gave him he gave him 10. he said praise god he said into the joys of the lord then that the one with the two came and he doubled his prophet but then the one that had a it's something that we rejoice with oh the holy ghost oh man it gives me strength every day but it's something that you need to work with god didn't give you the holy ghost just so you can sit at home god didn't give you the holy ghost just so that you can come to church and go home and come to church and go to work god gave you that gift god and it was just one solamentera uno and he said well what happened what why did you just come back with just the one and the man says i why aren't you fulfilling the potential god has already given you potential there has been people that that have been prayed over and prophesied and they're living below their potential and one of these days we're gonna have to answer for them why did you come back just with this when i gave you so much when i gave you all of this according to your abilities and you would come back with nothing this potential is so that we can work with so that we can multiply the eternity amongst our brothers and our sisters that's the worst feeling the feeling of not doing what you're supposed to do he actually said we're living million miles below our god-given privilege that's the worst feeling is that i could have done something but i didn't because i was afraid because i didn't know how no because i didn't know what step to take just step and god will fulfill your purpose just be led by the holy spirit just step into your promises step into your your purpose to you know there's a story of a young rich ruler now this man is called the young rich ruler so he's gotta be ambitious he's fulfilled a lot of things he's got riches but he was lacking one thing pero le faltava na that's how he felt he felt like he was still lacking yet he had everything so he went to the source of eternal life he said lord jesus dico senor jesus he said what can i do to inherit eternal life that's the best question we could ask it lord what can i do senor i read my bible i'm i'm a good student so you went to yante i'm a good worker so you went through i'm good to my parents this man he he didn't he wasn't a bad person he didn't live in a crazy family he he lived in a good home he had everything he wanted yet he was lacking what can i do to inherit eternal life and jesus looked at him jesus and maybe he saw him with all the potential he could be potential he saw his gift he saw his calling and he spoke to him and he said drop everything and come follow me and follow me but what did he do he was sorrowful he was sorrowful turned away from eternal life and lived his own life and continued to get rich brother i love the way brother branham says the story hermano encanta con el amano branam espica esta story because he pieces three scriptures together with the young rich ruler cornell rico the one that had the storehouses and the one that was in hell so then we see the progress of his life he see we see that that he looks at all of his storehouses and he had so much goods and so much things that all his storehouses were full que cadalfolista and the bible says in luke 12 19 it says he says and i will say to my soul so alma thou has much goods laid up for many years take dines drink and be married he was satisfied he fulfilled his earthly potential potential earthly ambition is good but it's so far beneath the god-given privileges you cannot compare it with eternal life it's good to go get money es it's good to live a good life it's when you don't rejected eternal life for it and he said that he was satisfied he was satisfied with the soul satisfaction and and when you know what potential is is potential that means there's more to come significa but he fulfilled his potential his earthly potential he said i have everything there is no more potential here no i must potentially there's no more reserved power there's no more opportunity i'm happy where i'm at on the story that's that was his life and we see that he was a rich man and there was a a poor man named lazarus that would eat breadcrumbs from his table and one day god called both of them to their destination and this young rich ruler yes job enrico already old gianciano looking at himself mirandos and finding himself in hell in contra what did he do he started to cry out to abraham abraham abraham his potential begin to rise up the gift that god called him to the call that jesus had given him but today tonight the opportunity stands there's more holy spirit to come there's more whole healing to come there's more power to come don't stop at where you're at don't stop at sanctification that desire to want more is there yes because that means if there's more more foreign he want he he wants to be evangelist then evangelista in hell the call that jesus had given him and he remembered it then he had five brothers and back at earth he didn't want them to be in that place he said lazarus say or he said send lazarus then back to tell my brothers not to come this way in other words accept the call and follow me the abraham said nope there's a chasm between us and there is no way for you to come back the calling is now el yamada what kind of life can you live for are we just happy just living a a formal christian life so much more power maybe because it's not planted in the right soil maybe it's not in in the specific conditions or temperature it should be in a condition maybe it's the humidity or the light because a seed can stay dormant for thousands of years potential can be the same thing it can stay dormant for years because you're not in the right condition maybe because the the climate isn't right maybe something is wrong and it could stay dormant and maybe we could say well i'm a christian christian i go to church i pay my tithes you're pagoda i'm good to my parents i'm good to my husband i'm good to my wife in the message god who is rich in mercy that's the same thing the believer is there's something in him when god when he meets god face to face he comes to himself the seed in him the seed is in him and it's quickened when is the seed in you you always were the seed siempre fuiste la cemente loose it's his watering of the word that activates your potential potential you know we know that god is omnipotent omnipotent when it was just him all alone all by himself nobody else no other thing that would help him out there was no situation that would help the sun was created billions of stars were were spread across the galaxy they're moons above planets above moons above planets lunas planets there was nothing to help him but what was in him was power it was out of him came all those things and after he created all those things all those galaxies do you think he was exhausted of power do you think he's so okay that's it that's that star is way too big that that could cost all my powers he's all potential that means he said there's more to come don't worry he created the land he created the animals he created the the the darkness and the light maybe you feel like there's nothing left god is all powerful he said hold on there's more to come there's more in our lives don't worry there's more to come no god is all potential every time god does a work there is still more in in the chamber there's still more untapped resources because he's all powerful he's all mighty ellis there's a in closing there's a message [Music] what happens when two omnipotents meet que pasa when god and man comes together two omnipotents something's got to change something's got to happen whatsoever you you'd say with that creative creative power of omnipotence of god whatever you say it doesn't matter if you're living in a harsh environment [Music] it doesn't matter if you're sick it doesn't matter if you're struggling it doesn't matter if you have a habit so what happens with two omnipotent speeches he says he said you say with that creative power of omnipotence of god knowing that he promised it makes them as though they are because two omnipotents have met he stands oh isn't that wonderful uh he'll see a glorified body glorificator you'll see a child of god you show them your mess the series isn't nice to look at it has all the power to give out fruit it has the power to give off eternal life don't listen to those that say you're not going to be there so you're not going to be there don't listen to your circumstances don't look at all the outward appearances and all the things of the world i am yo soy i am in his reflection you know when you get so close to somebody you love your child or your your your wife or your husband i keep a close eye on you because i know who you are you might be in a terrible condition but remember that is not your potential in the blood of jesus christ he sees a finished glorified body amen let us stand to our feet remember these words because the devil will like to tell you that you don't deserve to go to church oh that you don't deserve this and you don't deserve that that you're no good that you're living the wrong life just committed all to god you're a seed committed to the ground and god will water it and god will shine upon him [Music] that you can wipe it away in their faith their faith can look upon you and see that you already have done the work pray is your holy name we give you the glory glory in the name of the lord jesus [Music] christ [Music] me is [Music] is [Music] movies [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] that you live [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] praising god amen [Music] [Music] me [Music] my [Music] oh [Music] i [Music] is [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] now [Music] no foreign the time has come to dismiss if you could bow your head so we can go into prayer give you thanks for the opportunity to come lord and receive of your grace lord we ask you to be with us lord maybe take what we heard today when we place it in our hearts lord god [Music] and be with us throughout our week [Music] we ask all the stings in your precious name in the name of the jesus christ amen amen [Music] jesus has a table spread where the saints of god [Music] and supplies [Music] coming down table all the time [Music] satisfied the hungry every time oh come and die the master caller [Music] we [Music] soon [Music] jesus [Music] jesus table all the time
