stumbling block for anyone lord we place this service in your hands lord jesus in your precious name i ask and i pray amen amen amen um i want to start by reading a scripture if you're so kind to open your bibles up with me on a read from first peter 5 8 through 9. amen it reads like this be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour said whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the god of all grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by jesus by christ jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen settle you to him be glory and dominion forever and ever amen [Music] amen you may take your seats i'm in center i greet you all in the name of the lord jesus christ i am no i'm not a minister i um i'm not a good great speaker um uh i apologize to you beforehand uh the antenna le speed of this culpas um if you were expecting um one of the brothers that that normally speaks we're so blessed to have uh so many young men filled with the holy ghost and and and witnessing and bringing us the word of god so i apologize that you guys got like half not even half like a little portion of what should be happening and but whatever god's will is i'm here in obedience and uh i feel the lord uh tugging at my heart and like i said i want to testify of that i want to read another scripture it's found in ephesians 6 10. um if you want to turn with me it's it's it reads us this uh finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that you me ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the dark darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand for tomato pods amen so um i i have a little bit of a title i i call i'm calling it life versus death okay again this is my testimony of what i feel god has been doing in my life and most of most of what i'm going to be saying you can find it in uh in brother branham's message uh the greatest battle ever fought in contrary and putting on the whole armor of god i really felt led um by god to be hearing and and meditating on that embedded you know brother branham we hear him he says we we're not coming to a picnic and and he also says well he says we're coming to a battleground that's what we're coming to right so um in this message he also says that in the time of peace prepare for war and um i think one of the sermons i believe it's when he's talking when he's talking about putting on the whole armor of god it's a convention it's a convention and he's uh reminding the ministers it's a very simple message but he's reminding the ministers to put on the whole armor of god we're here brother branham oh yeah branham we know that he can give us a mouthful there's sermons that are four hours long i said so he begins to speak um about warfare he talks about how um how the stars are are so perfectly aligned and um he types it to god's army alleged he says that he says god's solar system is perfectly aligned we say el sistemas solar de dios esta alinado amen he says that in god's great army nothing gets out of place amen he says that he's talking about how if the moon gets out of place a little bit the ocean will start getting out of place too uh yeah and he types he he says god's heavenly host are perfect and he goes on and says that us earthly hosts are should be in line but clearly we're not we have amen so like i said i i want to testify a little bit about my life um so i was raised in the message like you all know community [Music] and he's going to start uh feeding you his doubt and his lies amen so as a as a young child you know i i i can remember being a very small child always being loved by my families having so much love around me so much brotherly love from all the but i couldn't help but have my day with the devil so as a young child in our mind in my mind and mimente i i can't even remember how far back maybe i was a infant uh but you begin to have these these thoughts that you know they're not from god it's a conscience right we all have a but as a child as having all this love and all this grace and mercy and going to church and people people showing me love my life you know brother banham says where this is a war that's going on this is it you know it's it's life or death it's la vida la muerte we begin to hear his lies that's literally what we're choosing is literally so as i grew older i i understood that i needed god's grace in my life you know i heard a brother say not too long ago he was talking about um the two p the two men that were going uh traveling to emmaus we are going to to masses and jesus appeared to them and they didn't recognize him you know and their hearts burned within them so many people in my life have been a representation of jesus christ you know but i heard this brother say but you know and it was very impactful to me he said that um jesus when he was on on the on the way with them this jesus he was going to continue they got to their destination and um they had to encourage him they had to invite him stay with us and i realized that as a young as a young person i have to invite jesus christ into my life you know i have these bad thoughts but and i um i began my christian walk christian as as a young person i believe i was 18 years old when i got baptized and um and i was it was i was joyful and i had received from the lord i began my personal relationship with jesus christ so along that way you know i i didn't realize that i was to be putting on the whole armor of god that i had been baptized and i received the lord give me my savior and i um i didn't feed myself my spirit i was going with my friends every day i forgot about jesus jesus i would come to church and and i would feel convicted and i would um and i would i would feel convicted and i would i would have remorse and and i stayed there in quebec for a long time just saying god i need your help i love you lord i i i i would say i know your word i believe your word [Music] so for a long time i stayed there i i thought i was a christian your pensaba you are cristiano i but i had somewhere along the line left jesus jesus um not saying that i was a bad person but i was more in tune with um the things of the flesh my friends amigos so i little by little i let the devil in just a tiny bit just a tiny bit you know that's how god needs to work god only needs a little tiny bit of faith but the devil the devil does the same thing says just come just come with me one time you'll have fun you're not gonna do anything wrong just just a little bit yeah you know when i i struggled i can honestly say that i fought yo honestly um and i wanted to um i brought myself down so i remember the first time being with my friends amigos and um i'm a really i like being i don't know if anybody will believe me but i like being the life of the party yeah i like i like you know if if i'm not having fun i kind of like i'll start rubbing off on somebody else or you know i want to leave and i think we're all kind of like that we kind of we we want to be entertained you know we're we're self centered so by the grace of god you know as a young person i i never got into into drugs but there came a life there came a time in my life and i remember i was saying that sometimes we well i remember i fought so hard the first time to to get high recorded [Music] i wanted it and it was something like it might have been something more social than what i really wanted to feel but it was something that i had like a desire because of maybe it was i was living in the flesh or because of my friends amigos you know brother banham talks about those like the pipe dreamers he calls it i think uh he says he says they'll get so high that they'll they'll fall asleep and die so i know that he says that the reason that they do that is because they're they're missing something they have a void and they're trying to satisfy that good things of the world but he types he says jesus is the lily jesus the lily of the valley elite the true opioid so you know for a long time i was happy i was happy doing what i was doing i would go with my friends amigos and i forgot about god i completely forgot about god and you know i was i was i was okay i wasn't i mean uh in in society just social um i was doing fine a little bit of drinking some smoking and and and just living in the world and and although i had a seat in me on youtube and i always knew that i was i was happy in what i was doing yo feliciano you know but things got worse i i started dealing with with with harder drugs i have a very addictive personality addictive so i mean i was just like just trying everything i could illo probably and you know i i still felt god calling in my life but i i wasn't i didn't want to hear the call you know i'd say if god's going to call me he's going to call me and and worse and worse and and to speed up my time i got to the point where i said i'm i'm going to you know my family was always going to church at this time my family tiempo assisted and i hadn't gone to church maybe for like three three four years or somewhere around there for a few years maybe i would go a sunday quesadilla domingo or i would i would just go once in a while um but never never to be to be really paying attention but there came a time where i was so caught up in what i was doing and i felt that i was literally going to die and i was with with evil people some evil people and i just just had a bad company around me company and i wanted to i i was surrounded by my family still yeah my family had a lot of love around and there was a point in my life that i wanted to i still had the call from god and i wanted to um give god a try i was tired of i was i was going in circles for a little while i was going in circles for a little while and um i realized i was trying to give god a try immediately but it wasn't so easy anymore i would find myself going to church i would say i'm going to go to church today and i would be driving to church it was like they put a wall up for me um so i like i said i was involved in some some pretty bad things just i said well it's all right i can i'll fix myself i'll i'll go clean and and i'll try to get back to church little by little i'll ease my way in yo you know but but the hard part was i couldn't do it anymore i was i was dead inside por dentos i was doing so many things i see a tantasu away from god's word i had that it had a grip on me and i couldn't break free you know so i kept trying to come to church i kept trying i wanted to yo but i would fall deeper and deeper and further and further and i couldn't get out i was lost i couldn't get freed i don't know if i could express myself more no products but i was trapped brothers i couldn't break free no more yeah i wanted to give god my heart regardless but i was so far away prior it's like he couldn't hear me i wanted i wanted to change my life but it wasn't happening brothers i was so desperate because i was i was using these these hard drugs that there was nothing that i could do to help myself that it's it's not something that i would encourage anybody to go through the que i felt like i felt like i was walking with god by the hand when i was baptized and you know we're living in a dark age you know this is the end time we hear brother madam speak about habla elementa the rapture and and you know what's what's going to take place you know there's not much left we're we're expecting a rapture right yes so i used to walk with god by the hand you want this coming but i lost his i lost his grip and it was like i expected to find god just by just by feeling around but it was there came a time and i i truly believe that's god's grace in my life my family my family the love i have around me el amor i felt like i was god was way distant in the mountain he was a mountain way far off a mountain i couldn't see yo i was lost completely lost there's no hope for me completely in darkness brother i had to i used to i would i'm praying and praying that god's holy spirit coming to my life johannes espiritu doctors will tell me oh you need you need to to get off of that drug you need this drug doctor and you know i believed in faith that god could heal me from what what i was going through no matter they would say you you're never going to be the same no important i would i stood on i would i would just say praise god thank you god for healing me and it took a good while it took a long time it wasn't it wasn't a uh it wasn't from one moment to the next you know i read the scripture putting on the whole armor of god sorry i'm not i'm not a great speaker but i want to read a quote from brother branham de la mana branham um it's from the greatest battle ever fought and uh let's see here i don't know i don't think they have it but so it's kind of lengthy but i'm going to kind of paraphrase through it here i didn't read it i didn't actually read the scripture but let me let me just read it real quick for you bro so on ephesians 6 13 it says wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god today ye may be able to withstand the evil day in having done all to stand up stand therefore establish having your low end skirt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked con and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all for all saints santos so brother branham says here is branham he says now that that's the two great forces that's coming together right now let me go back he says that's what satan is he's a destroyer penis and flusteration frustrations and worry all on satan god is life faith faith peace now that's the two great forces that's coming together right now they're battling they're battling right here in the building right now they battle day by day with you every force satan following you along satan that great big kindly priestly goliath trying to scare the liver out of you he's right you're fortified amen with the gospel cornelius with the word of truth around your loins glory meet me in the name of organization organization you meet me in the name of this that or the other es but i meet you in the name of the lord jesus the lord god of israel um i don't measure up to how brother branham is really saying this here you he says satan's army brings diseases and god's army is commissioned to cast them out that's the very technique that god uses and use the army of destruction to disbelieve god's word and set him up a better kingdom than michael had paradise miguel and god cast them out god's method is cast out the devil cast down reasoning you know we live in this flesh here five senses we hear about the five senses we hear about the the five spiritual the s of the soul the senses of the soul atamino de you know there's uh this imagination i like conscience conscience memory memorial reason and affection you see um a lot of times this is how i had it understood you know i can't live in the flesh you know i got to be careful with my eyes and i got to be careful of what i'm taking in so i have to uh be careful with what what i'm what i'm reasoning in here what i'm coming to understand now is that those channels conductors are only are only used by satan to give us doubt so there's there's it's really what matters is our soul bro you know our faith in god's word so when we're we can't dwell but that's what god's word is you know i i had a little bit of the world poco del mundo and with that little bit of the devil no matter who my family was important no matter who was praying for me it seemed important for me you know he took over my life because i let a little bit of imagination go away from god's word you know i like what brother eli said where you have to be faith tested [Music] you know we uh that was one thing that i didn't i didn't have it i didn't have faith in god's word sure i was i i i did i did understand christ india he died for my sins you know he we're coming to the world in a sinful condition but in order for us to survive and overcome even sir we need we need god's word and only god's word that's the only thing that's going to bring bring us from death and to life you know i i my dad taught me very well what's happening performance in muy bien about the word and how um adam and eve and we we come to this world in a fall in nature you know we know so much about the word but do we apply it to our lives i wasn't applying it to my life and um i had fallen into so much doubt i allowed permittee influence to to lead me astray okay you know we're all influenced by someone must and as an adult elderly person will be led by someone as well and we're living in a in a dark age right now but god is is preparing a bride he's preparing someone else that's gonna follow his word and and we have people around us that are filled with the holy spirit and and either we we put ourselves shoulder to shoulder with them we have people dedicated to his word they have given their lives for this message and um and it's it's an individual affair yes we all have to die like like kane died on the sacrifice of sacrificial we have to sacrifice our own lives there's no there's nothing else left for us it's life or death it is it truly is i can't express myself enough el diablo but by the grace of god i believe god i'm a child of god i have a i am a seed yo soy simente and that life began to sprout yes and and it's still working in my life i'm not perfect to have a lot of problems but i believe that god's holy spirit is working in my life [Music] you know i i came back to um i came back to god around say three years ago i i try to i i dedicated my life yo i was at the edge of death i i felt like death was haunting me and i stood i said i am going to stand on god's word then i will die saying that i accept jesus christ and i and i became stubborn not letting anything knock me over just standing standing on god's word you know we all have to be tested i like how brother eli talked about those hebrew children you know those those hebrew children had to to to take a stand posture you know and sometimes that well that's what the devil does he'll take something of god and pervert [Music] but they knew not to worship any idols like abraham abraham god god gave him his word he said you're going to receive a child and abraham was becoming old he was dying [Music] you know there's there's a there's a whole list daniel daniel in the lion's den he stood on god's word regardless of everything happening around him [Music] at moses actually stood and defied our physics our nature amen just like joshua did to it joshua went to the promised land god said i promise you this land you're going to take this land over joseph you know and they stood on god he stood on god's word he said we're more than able to to conquer it you know and god has given us his word this right here this whole armor of god is you know it's like you're being enlisted and they're giving you this list of what's going to protect you it is but it's not a lie but this is the way to to overcome the devil este is what does it say when you've done everything he says when you've done everything you can to stand you just stand if you say what else could i do stand on god's word you know even if death were to take me ancilla you know by the grace of god i overcame that i can say now that i'm healed from all of my addictions and my problems the devil had me bound but i'm free by the power of jesus christ's blood you know i i'm not very good at expressing myself no bueno for example but i have life now but i'm not the best at any at anything you know i'm i'm like i said i'm just like barely a fraction of of what we have here but i know that i want god's word in my heart you know all these all these uh people of the bible that i was going over you know but we have god's grace and his mercy the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world jesus knows each and every one of you jesus christ you know he loved he loved us before we can he loved us before we can love him what does it matter if if this world falls apart if nothing goes right see now we have an insert we have an internal home waiting for us you know we we have an inheritance we don't have to do anything not we're so you know we we may act like we we feel a certain way but god knows how we really feel you know when you're when you're in the presence of god you can't you can't avoid that conviction you know someday we'll stand before him and and why not give our lives today to jesus christ i've understood that i was at the point of of of killing myself and it wasn't my choice you know foreign i had to i didn't do anything to deserve it i just accepted it i said to god's grace in my life [Music] and the devil took took me over like a roaring lion it's so easy to get away from god's word may god have mercy on us i i think that i've said what what's on my heart that god's holy spirit is working in my life he's working in in all our all of our lives if we could just stop and listen and hear what god has to say to us yes and i truly believe that um he is sent by by the lord our lord jesus christ he's a prophet of this last day and and we believe that it's it's not a make-believe story and jesus is coming for his bride and i want to be ready i don't want to i don't want to be uh
