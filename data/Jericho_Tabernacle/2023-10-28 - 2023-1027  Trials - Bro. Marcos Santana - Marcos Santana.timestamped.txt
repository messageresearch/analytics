[35:23] of the Lord Jesus
[35:25] Christ

[35:30] too long
[35:33] ago a sister that I love
[35:37] dearly she might not know
[35:40] it and she asked
[35:42] me she kind of like uh a little bit
[35:45] almost like scolding me but she asked
[35:50] me
[35:52] brother when are you going to start
[35:54] preaching
[35:55] again
[35:58] don't worry
[35:59] sister uh they have me scheduled

[36:11] could but I'm just trying to call my
[36:13] nerves forgive
[36:16] me um since since I have you all
[36:19] standing if you do me a favor of opening
[36:21] your scriptures at this
[36:25] moment we're going to turn to the book
[36:28] of 2 Corinthians chapter
[36:33] 12 and we're going to read verses 9 and
[36:39] 10 I'm just trying to find the young
[36:41] people here
[36:44] tonight just to see who who I'm talking
[36:47] to this
[36:51] evening all right amen God bless you
[36:54] young people
[36:55] tonight
[36:57] this is youth
[36:59] service and we're happy and and and so
[37:01] encouraged to always minister to the
[37:03] young
[37:08] people 2 Corinthians 12:9
[37:13] reads and he said unto me my grace is
[37:17] sufficient for thee for my strength is
[37:20] made perfect in weakness most gladly
[37:23] therefore I will rather glorify in my
[37:25] infirmities that the power of Christ May
[37:28] rest upon
[37:42] me therefore I take pleasure in
[37:45] infirmities in reproaches in Necessities
[37:48] in persecutions in distress for Christ's
[37:51] sake for when I am weak then I am
[37:55] strong
[38:07] the definition of infirmities young
[38:10] people I I found was physical or mental
[38:17] weaknesses a
[38:20] physical or even a mental
[38:24] weakness so take pleasure in
[38:27] your
[38:29] infirmities if you be so kind to turn
[38:32] over to
[38:35] James chapter
[38:37] one we're only going to read four
[38:39] scriptures
[38:43] here verse two
[38:46] reads my brethren count it all joy when
[38:50] you fall into diverse
[38:53] [Music]
[38:55] Temptations
[38:58] count it Joy young
[39:01] people when the trials and the troubles
[39:04] come to your
[39:06] life verse
[39:09] three knowing
[39:11] this that the trying of your faith it
[39:14] worketh
[39:18] patience that this trial you have right
[39:22] now it it comes with the
[39:25] reward
[39:27] it's got a gift and a prize at the end
[39:29] of that
[39:32] trial but let patience have her perfect
[39:35] work that ye may be perfect and entire
[39:38] wanting
[39:46] nothing that that gift that will be
[39:48] given to
[39:50] you once you've gone through the
[39:54] trial once you've shown to be an
[39:55] overcomer
[39:59] like here it says the patience the gift
[40:01] of
[40:03] patience we got to let it grow and let
[40:05] it
[40:07] mature so that after the
[40:10] trial it can be found
[40:14] perfect complete it can be found
[40:18] sealed but we need the
[40:22] trial if we bow our heads for
[40:25] prayer

[41:12] man but the words of God
[41:15] lord and all I ask is just simple words
[41:18] that can impact the Heart
[41:23] Tonight father we thank you for the
[41:25] trials that have got us up to this
[41:30] point for I look upon Overcomers this
[41:37] evening Overcomers that overcame to even

[41:44] tonight even the Overcomers that
[41:46] overcame to tune in online to watch this
[41:49] service

[42:55] part
[42:58] uh we read first cor second Corinthians
[43:00] and
[43:04] James and and to give it a title this
[43:09] evening I think the audio department is
[43:12] already connected in the
[43:17] spirit I didn't even tell them what the
[43:19] title was
[43:22] yet but I see it up top
[43:25] trials
[43:27] praise God for
[43:28] them I want to read a quote real
[43:32] quick from the message a second-handed
[43:36] robe says when I heard the pastor say
[43:39] this morning that many are becoming
[43:47] discouraged what we need brother is to
[43:50] take
[43:53] courage we need to be encouraged
[43:58] so we're going to need you to take some
[43:59] courage
[44:02] tonight we're praying that the minister
[44:04] can give some encouragement also
[44:09] tonight especially for our young people
[44:13] here brother Brandon says the trials may
[44:17] come we may we we never was promised to
[44:20] be immune from
[44:24] them but he give Grace to go through
[44:29] them and I like what he says right
[44:31] here if the mountain is too high to go
[44:36] over if it's too deep to go
[44:41] under if it's too wide to go around
[44:46] it notice the supernatural with this
[44:49] next sentence
[44:52] here he'll give Grace to just go right
[44:55] through it
[44:59] to do what the
[45:02] impossible you can go over it we can fly
[45:04] over the
[45:07] mountain you can dig to go under the
[45:12] mountain you can drive around your
[45:17] trials but take on that mountain head on
[45:20] and go right through
[45:23] it it's going to take something super
[45:28] Supernatural brother Brandon says that's
[45:30] right just don't worry keep your eyes on
[45:36] Christ for he's the only one that can
[45:39] get us
[45:41] through how many believe that
[45:44] tonight you know God's word says that my
[45:47] grace is
[45:49] sufficient and you know young people do
[45:51] we truly know what that
[45:54] means when we hear it said over and over
[45:57] and
[45:59] over to truly know my his grace is
[46:05] sufficient you know if we can compare to
[46:07] the
[46:09] ocean how much those those animals of
[46:11] the ocean they drink water
[46:16] constantly if we were all to just take
[46:18] as much buckets of water as we can and
[46:20] we
[46:23] need and everybody on this Earth
[46:27] there would still be more water in the
[46:29] ocean day after
[46:32] day if if we could take it a step
[46:37] further into the air of our
[46:41] atmosphere you know that if there's no
[46:44] way that we could inhale all the air and
[46:46] take it away from our
[46:52] atmosphere much less in the universe
[46:54] than in the cosmos
[46:58] well that is God's
[47:00] grace it never runs
[47:02] out it is more than
[47:05] sufficient it comes from an eternal
[47:08] being from an everlasting
[47:12] being that that Grace it's always got
[47:14] more to give and more to give and more
[47:16] to
[47:19] give you know young people that
[47:22] Grace that that they all sufficient
[47:24] Grace from God
[47:29] you know it's so much it's enough for my
[47:34] forgiveness there's enough Grace for
[47:36] your
[47:38] forgiveness there's enough Grace for
[47:40] your sins you might have
[47:44] committed if someone one day went to
[47:47] backslide there's Grace for your
[47:48] backsliding
[47:53] condition if there's a young person that
[47:55] has had bad thoughts this morning
[47:56] there's Grace for those bad
[48:01] thoughts if there's a brother or sister
[48:03] that didn't correct things this morning
[48:05] there's Grace for your bad
[48:11] actions that all sufficient
[48:14] Grace has been there and it's been
[48:19] mindful of you and I before the
[48:24] trial it's been help ful for you and
[48:28] I even before the
[48:30] trial and because it was present
[48:34] before it's going to be present
[48:37] during so it's going to get you through
[48:40] each and every trial you have right here
[48:42] right
[48:45] now you know Jesus said my strength is
[48:49] made perfect in
[48:52] weakness and you know I I don't see a
[48:54] weakness in my God
[48:58] I don't see a weakness in our Lord Jesus
[49:01] Christ and I was asking myself then how
[49:04] is that
[49:07] possible well I see the weaknesses
[49:09] Within
[49:11] Myself from this Fallen condition that
[49:14] I'm
[49:16] in and then I look back to the
[49:19] word and I remember that blind
[49:22] man how how there was no sin in his life
[49:25] for his
[49:28] life but yet he was crutched by an
[49:33] infirmity he was burdened by a
[49:38] weakness of being
[49:40] blind then you take the woman with the
[49:42] blood
[49:45] issue as far as I know she wasn't a
[49:47] secret
[49:51] sinner she wasn't living
[49:54] Unholy living in this dirty
[49:58] lifestyle but she had a
[50:01] weakness she was burdened by a
[50:05] sickness and that was of the blood issue
[50:07] that she carried for
[50:10] years so then through those
[50:15] weaknesses through my human
[50:18] weaknesses there is where God's strength
[50:21] is
[50:23] displayed there is where that power and
[50:25] that Glory can come into
[50:30] manifestation where through those
[50:32] weaknesses that each and every one of us
[50:37] have that strength is made perfect in
[50:41] us it's made visible and just
[50:46] undeniable through our
[50:50] weaknesses through our
[50:53] sicknesses through our infirmity
[50:58] brother brandom says in the message an
[50:59] ins
[51:02] sign many times people
[51:06] say you see all that sickness in that
[51:11] family I told
[51:13] you they're just not living
[51:18] right how that hurts so much to read
[51:21] something like
[51:22] that to think that sometimes we make
[51:26] mistakes like
[51:29] that to cast judgment like
[51:33] that brother brandham
[51:35] continues said they're not living
[51:38] right he says now God does do that
[51:44] sometimes so we're not ignoring that
[51:47] that does
[51:49] happen but brother BR says but not every
[51:52] time is it God doing that
[51:58] CU God's
[51:59] here and he's dealing with a
[52:03] saint no I'm I'm a bit of a
[52:06] dummy every now and then things pop up
[52:09] to
[52:10] me but it ain't too
[52:13] often he
[52:14] says not every time is God doing
[52:19] that cuz God's
[52:21] here dealing with a
[52:24] saint so even if it's that family that
[52:27] was living
[52:30] wrong or just one of us that just
[52:32] happened to fall in this
[52:37] trial brother brandom said he's dealing
[52:40] not with the
[52:43] sinner no he's dealing with
[52:47] Saints the saints that I'm looking at
[52:51] today maybe
[52:54] backsliding May maybe in
[52:56] sin maybe going through a trial of
[53:01] hell but I'm going to call y'all a
[53:05] saint because we are
[53:07] Saints he says he's dealing with a
[53:12] saint the trying and proving of a
[53:17] saint every man that cometh to God must
[53:19] first be tried of
[53:23] God and if he can't stand
[53:27] chastisement then you become an
[53:29] illegitimate
[53:32] child not a child of
[53:35] God trials to try our
[53:40] faith brother isn't it
[53:43] marvelous that God would give us those
[53:46] trials just to test and to prove
[53:52] us so so being a youth service
[53:57] we know you've got tests you've got
[54:01] trials sometimes you can't explain
[54:04] it maybe your dad's not a
[54:08] minister maybe you're too embarrassed to
[54:10] go approach the
[54:13] pastor but just understand the trials
[54:16] you're going
[54:19] through are given to a
[54:22] saint you are a saint
[54:25] and you need to be tested and
[54:29] proven the Bible says in Romans
[54:33] 8:28 we know that all things work for
[54:36] good work all things work together for
[54:39] good to them that love
[54:45] God and to them who are called according
[54:47] to his
[54:51] purpose is there young people that love
[54:53] God tonight
[54:56] okay I see some hands
[54:59] raised and now do you have the same kind
[55:01] of Faith to believe that you're called
[55:03] according to his
[55:08] purpose because it's a two-part thing
[55:12] here everybody claims to love
[55:16] him but are you
[55:19] called if you're doubting
[55:22] tonight I'm going to have a little bit
[55:24] of faith for you
[55:26] I have faith that you're called
[55:29] tonight I have faith that you've been an
[55:31] overcomer to be here
[55:34] tonight and there's a purpose in your
[55:37] life and in each and every one of those
[55:41] trials when I read this scripture the
[55:43] moment it became a revelation to
[55:48] me many years
[55:50] ago the word coincidence I threw it in
[55:52] the
[55:54] trash
[55:55] that word chance I got rid of it a long
[55:57] time
[56:01] ago that whole good luck bad luck
[56:05] thing no that don't exist over here with
[56:08] us this is all
[56:11] things work together for the
[56:14] good so the bad
[56:18] times good
[56:20] times my
[56:21] confusion my
[56:23] certainty and my
[56:26] trials they all work for my
[56:30] good and in James
[56:33] 1:12 says blessed is the man that
[56:36] endureth
[56:39] Temptation blessed are you young
[56:43] person that can endure the
[56:47] trials it says for when you are
[56:52] tried you shall receive the Crown of
[56:54] Life
[56:57] which the Lord hath promised to
[57:01] them and every one of you young people
[57:03] if I'm not
[57:06] mistaken you raised your hand to say you
[57:08] love
[57:11] him so it says this right here is
[57:16] promised to you all that raise your hand
[57:18] saying I love Jesus
[57:23] Christ you see each and every trial that
[57:26] we go
[57:29] through it it carries a god-sent
[57:34] purpose there's a god-sent reason for
[57:36] the trials we go
[57:40] through and and if we
[57:43] remember keep in mind nothing is a
[57:45] coincidence with
[57:49] God then the pain you're going through
[57:53] tonight the suffering you might be going
[57:56] through
[57:58] tonight the petition that maybe nobody
[58:01] else knows but you
[58:05] tonight that petition is not by
[58:09] chance it carries a god-sent
[58:14] purpose and if it's sent from
[58:18] God then God has got to have a god-sent
[58:23] answer because he doesn't leave anything
[58:28] undone whatever he started he's going to
[58:32] finish it if he's placed a trial in your
[58:35] life he's got to see the Fulfillment and
[58:37] the end of that trial in your
[58:40] life because before he placed the trial
[58:45] there he said you know
[58:48] what it's time for me to give my brother
[58:50] Jesse the gift of
[58:53] knowledge Jess
[58:56] he was already thinking of the gift
[58:58] before the
[59:00] trial but we focus on the trial and not
[59:03] the
[59:06] gift that's why I wanted you young
[59:08] people to keep in your
[59:11] heart blessed are you that endure that
[59:14] trial that
[59:20] Temptation This is a youth service I
[59:22] can't say it enough
[59:26] and I just want to stay simple
[59:29] again but if it if it applies to anybody
[59:32] else well
[59:35] amen if your trial has
[59:38] been you know a a courtship
[59:44] heartbreak if your trial has been a a
[59:47] broken heart due to a
[59:52] friendship if your trial is is a family
[59:55] member that's in deep
[59:59] sickness maybe your trial is a hardship
[1:00:02] in the
[1:00:05] church or even a hardship of a
[1:00:08] ministerial
[1:00:11] tension behind every
[1:00:15] trial there is a
[1:00:19] reward somebody here
[1:00:21] tonight through the trial that you're
[1:00:24] going through
[1:00:27] big or
[1:00:28] small short or
[1:00:30] long someone at the end of that
[1:00:34] trial after
[1:00:37] overcoming not my
[1:00:39] overcoming your
[1:00:42] overcoming but because he gave me that
[1:00:44] Grace and carried me to be an
[1:00:49] overcomer someone will receive
[1:00:52] Faith someone will receive receive
[1:00:55] virtue someone will receive
[1:00:58] knowledge someone will receive
[1:01:01] Temperance someone will receive
[1:01:03] patience someone will receive
[1:01:06] godliness brotherly
[1:01:09] kindness someone will receive agap
[1:01:16] love I was telling some brothers last
[1:01:21] weekend you know uh I don't know if
[1:01:24] they're here this
[1:01:25] evening but I was joking but at the same
[1:01:28] time a little
[1:01:30] serious saying you know I think I got
[1:01:32] the gift of patience and of temperance
[1:01:38] today because last
[1:01:40] minute I received a phone call from one
[1:01:43] of our
[1:01:45] teachers that they couldn't teach the
[1:01:47] little kids Sunday
[1:01:52] school our children of 4 to eight
[1:01:56] that is a very special
[1:01:58] age and if you've got children in that
[1:02:01] age
[1:02:04] group you know how special your children
[1:02:09] are now I've got special
[1:02:13] ways of
[1:02:15] discipline I've got special
[1:02:18] ways of
[1:02:20] Correction I've got special ways of
[1:02:23] instruction
[1:02:25] that's for my
[1:02:26] children they might not be the way you
[1:02:28] deal with your
[1:02:32] children but that's how I deal with my
[1:02:35] children and and it it was somewhat of a
[1:02:38] of a revelation to
[1:02:39] [Music]
[1:02:41] me in dealing with about 13 of our
[1:02:43] beautiful 4 to eighty
[1:02:48] olds you know I I just started thinking
[1:02:51] to
[1:02:52] myself you know the minister doesn't
[1:02:54] preach to a
[1:02:57] sheep he preaches to a flock of
[1:03:01] sheep the Deacon doesn't Deacon a
[1:03:05] sheep the Deacon he deacons a flock of
[1:03:10] sheep the pastor doesn't Pastor a
[1:03:15] sheep he pastors a whole flock of
[1:03:19] sheep so some kids might need this
[1:03:23] discipline
[1:03:26] some kids need this
[1:03:29] discipline some kids are taught
[1:03:33] visually some kids are taught
[1:03:37] verbally and and and and you know I came
[1:03:40] out with a very good lesson that
[1:03:45] Sunday of patience and
[1:03:49] Temperance but we have some very
[1:03:51] beautiful children here at Jericho
[1:03:53] Tabernacle
[1:03:56] and they did teach me a big
[1:03:58] lesson and it gave me a new respect for
[1:04:01] our teachers here in this
[1:04:06] Tabernacle for the time and the effort
[1:04:09] and the strength they have to to to love
[1:04:11] and teach our
[1:04:17] children because one day they'll be
[1:04:19] sitting in these
[1:04:22] pews one day they'll hear word that will
[1:04:24] resonate in their
[1:04:27] heart they'll say I remember sister
[1:04:30] Rachel she taught us about
[1:04:34] that I remember Sister Gabby she taught
[1:04:37] me about
[1:04:39] that and then you get a young man
[1:04:41] Minister like
[1:04:44] this and then they see wow I'm no longer
[1:04:47] like those little
[1:04:50] kids but pretty soon I'm going to be
[1:04:52] like that young man
[1:04:56] the the the the the growth and the
[1:04:58] maturity of our spiritual
[1:05:02] walk and how it all starts with the time
[1:05:04] and the care we give them in that Sunday
[1:05:11] school and I'm not trying to preach
[1:05:13] about Sunday school forgive
[1:05:16] me but it it I learned patience and
[1:05:19] Temperance I'll repeat it
[1:05:23] again
[1:05:25] but getting back to the topic this
[1:05:28] evening you know just think for one one
[1:05:31] second our Prophet said that we had to
[1:05:34] get in a state of
[1:05:39] desperation okay everyone seems calm
[1:05:44] tonight so imagine to go from your your
[1:05:47] Tranquility into
[1:05:51] desperation what does that look like
[1:05:54] what does that feel
[1:05:56] like he says so we got to get in a sense
[1:05:58] of desperation to wake
[1:06:02] up to come to the feet of
[1:06:05] Jesus many he says many times that's
[1:06:08] what it's going to
[1:06:10] take where you're in a corner and your
[1:06:12] only options is life and
[1:06:16] death so then I I think of
[1:06:19] that and I think of the trials that
[1:06:22] we're all going through
[1:06:25] and if God's trying to give us seal us
[1:06:28] with the next stature of a perfect
[1:06:34] man another
[1:06:36] gift I say if I'm going to get the GI uh
[1:06:40] G give given the gift of
[1:06:45] temperance now this is just me it might
[1:06:48] be different for
[1:06:50] you what would God
[1:06:52] do would he being that I'm from
[1:06:57] California make every single day for two
[1:07:00] years straight a slow driver get in
[1:07:01] front of me on the
[1:07:08] road and my flesh wants to just shout at
[1:07:12] him and curse at him and do all these
[1:07:14] crazy
[1:07:18] things and and I'm learning
[1:07:21] Temperance or or would he bring it more
[1:07:23] to toward the spiritual
[1:07:26] side and being that we we got to get in
[1:07:29] a state of
[1:07:32] desperation a trial is not a
[1:07:36] trial if it doesn't shake you
[1:07:38] up if it doesn't get you to a
[1:07:41] point where you can't find the
[1:07:45] solution where where you need help from
[1:07:49] somebody and the only somebody that can
[1:07:51] help you is our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:56] so I think maybe if I had to get the
[1:07:58] gift of
[1:08:02] temperance it might take a brother or
[1:08:05] sister in
[1:08:08] church to cross me so
[1:08:13] bad that that that's going to put me in
[1:08:15] such a drastic
[1:08:19] situation so
[1:08:21] uncomfortable so irritated that that I
[1:08:24] don't know where to
[1:08:26] turn that then the only person I can
[1:08:29] turn
[1:08:31] to is to my Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:08:35] Christ because I can't deal with
[1:08:38] him or I can't deal with this
[1:08:42] situation it's too much for
[1:08:44] me so we go to him to
[1:08:48] overcome and then we're given the
[1:08:52] gift we're sealed with with
[1:08:56] Temperance or maybe
[1:08:58] patience or maybe brotherly
[1:09:02] kindness or maybe even AAP
[1:09:06] love once again this was for
[1:09:10] me in the message Awakening
[1:09:14] Jesus brother Bram
[1:09:16] says he tries to prove us and see he
[1:09:20] tries to prove us and see where we'll
[1:09:22] stand or not
[1:09:28] take a Revival
[1:09:30] away start an argument in the
[1:09:34] church just to see what you'll
[1:09:38] do that's pretty
[1:09:40] deep just to see what I'm going to
[1:09:44] do if I'm going to put ey in
[1:09:48] this I'm going to put I in
[1:09:51] this to see what I'm going going to
[1:09:55] do says turn Satan loose among
[1:10:00] you and see how you'll
[1:10:05] stand now I'm maybe I'm
[1:10:08] crazy he didn't say to see how you'll
[1:10:12] fall to see how you'll get back
[1:10:16] up no to see how you'll
[1:10:21] stand some might stand leaning on the
[1:10:26] edge some might
[1:10:28] stand breathing
[1:10:34] heavy some might be so strong and mature
[1:10:37] be standing
[1:10:44] firm see how you'll
[1:10:48] stand let him strike
[1:10:52] you strike
[1:10:54] you with
[1:10:56] something to see what kind of stand
[1:10:59] you'll
[1:11:01] take that's profound to
[1:11:04] me in Simplicity and in its
[1:11:08] profoundness job
[1:11:10] said though he slay
[1:11:14] me yet I'll trust
[1:11:18] him so no matter what the trial he will
[1:11:21] put upon my
[1:11:22] life
[1:11:25] in the church out the
[1:11:27] church in my family out the
[1:11:30] family in my spiritual or in my
[1:11:35] natural though he slay
[1:11:37] me yet I will still trust
[1:11:42] him says Shadrach M and abedo
[1:11:47] said our God is able to Deliver Us from
[1:11:50] the
[1:11:52] fire but
[1:11:54] nevertheless we'll go in the
[1:11:57] fire because we're not giving
[1:12:00] up brother brandom says but we get all
[1:12:06] flustrated and you
[1:12:08] know like they
[1:12:10] did the disciples did he
[1:12:14] says because we're human just like they
[1:12:19] were so yes we can get a little
[1:12:21] religious sometimes
[1:12:25] we get a little Apostolic
[1:12:27] sometimes we can get a little excited
[1:12:30] sometimes but even brother Brandon
[1:12:32] brought us
[1:12:35] down to remind us yes you're going to be
[1:12:38] on the
[1:12:40] highs but you're going to have the lows
[1:12:43] too cuz don't forget we're still in this
[1:12:46] human
[1:12:49] body just like the disciples were
[1:12:54] 1 Peter 1:6
[1:12:57] says wherein ye greatly Rejoice though
[1:13:00] now for a season if need be ye are in
[1:13:03] heaviness through manifold
[1:13:13] Temptations young people
[1:13:17] Rejoice it's only
[1:13:20] temporary it's only for a season
[1:13:24] me and my brother Emanuel were just
[1:13:25] joking in the
[1:13:28] back there's a time for
[1:13:30] everything some of y'all are going to be
[1:13:32] going through it
[1:13:34] today while I'm kicking back
[1:13:37] today but then in a month from
[1:13:40] now I'm going to be going through
[1:13:43] it while you're enjoying of His
[1:13:47] blessings so young people it's only
[1:13:52] temporary
[1:13:53] verse 7 says the trial that the trial of
[1:13:56] your faith being much more precious than
[1:13:58] gold that perisheth though it be tried
[1:14:00] with fire will be found unto praise
[1:14:03] honor and Glory at the appearing of
[1:14:05] Jesus
[1:14:17] Christ I think I spoke on this
[1:14:21] before but this is your faith Young
[1:14:24] people showing us how it's it's the
[1:14:26] equivalent of
[1:14:28] gold the most precious thing on
[1:14:32] earth and though it's the most precious
[1:14:34] thing on
[1:14:36] earth it can still be melted down and be
[1:14:41] nothing but your
[1:14:43] faith is more precious than gold cannot
[1:14:47] be melted
[1:14:48] down it will stand through the hands of
[1:14:51] time it be time tested
[1:14:55] Faith because it cannot
[1:14:58] perish it came from God and that of God
[1:15:02] is
[1:15:03] eternal so keep feeding that faith and
[1:15:06] feeding that
[1:15:09] faith and keep allowing the trials to
[1:15:12] grow that faith in your
[1:15:16] life because remember after the
[1:15:21] trials comes the
[1:15:24] reward I can't say it
[1:15:27] enough now we heard how brother brandham
[1:15:31] said take
[1:15:33] courage take courage
[1:15:35] brothers and then he said you need to be
[1:15:40] encouraged I'm I'm going to throw a
[1:15:41] little bit of encouragement to the young
[1:15:45] people verse eight
[1:15:47] says when whom having not seen you
[1:15:52] love
[1:15:54] in whom though now ye see him not yet
[1:15:57] you
[1:16:00] believe that is so tremendous to
[1:16:04] me you know so many people in
[1:16:07] here did not have the privilege of
[1:16:10] seeing brother
[1:16:12] brandham every one of us in
[1:16:15] here did not have the privilege of
[1:16:17] seeing Jesus
[1:16:19] Christ you know there's young people in
[1:16:22] here
[1:16:23] that they they didn't see brother
[1:16:25] Brandon much less Jesus
[1:16:28] Christ and now there's newborn babies
[1:16:32] here that are going to grow
[1:16:35] up they didn't know brother
[1:16:38] Johnny they didn't know brother
[1:16:40] Bernie they didn't know brother
[1:16:43] Brandon they didn't know
[1:16:46] Jesus but yet right here it's telling
[1:16:50] you I didn't need to see
[1:16:55] but I still love
[1:16:57] him I didn't need to see
[1:16:59] him but I still believe in him with all
[1:17:02] of my
[1:17:05] heart my brother Jesse that I work with
[1:17:10] you know he he gets on my case so much
[1:17:11] at
[1:17:13] work and he's been on this revival about
[1:17:18] Rahab and as I was reading this
[1:17:21] scripture it came to my mind about
[1:17:24] Rahab and how brother Brandon says she's
[1:17:27] a type of us the
[1:17:30] bride and she too she didn't need to see
[1:17:34] Moses she didn't need to see the pillar
[1:17:37] of
[1:17:38] fire she didn't need to prove through
[1:17:40] these people with Miracles and
[1:17:45] wonders but yet she
[1:17:49] believed she was a
[1:17:51] Believer and she received her reward for
[1:17:57] believing what is that
[1:17:59] reward verse
[1:18:01] 9 receiving at the end of your faith the
[1:18:04] salvation of your
[1:18:10] souls what greater reward than my
[1:18:13] eternal
[1:18:17] salvation you know I want to
[1:18:18] differentiate two
[1:18:21] things uh between happiness and
[1:18:26] joy you know happiness is is is to be
[1:18:29] said it's dependent on an
[1:18:33] emotion you know it's uh when someone
[1:18:35] does something nice to
[1:18:36] [Music]
[1:18:38] you H you feel happy you do something
[1:18:42] fun you get
[1:18:44] happy some someone gives you something
[1:18:47] sweet you get
[1:18:49] happy they're kind to you you get tingly
[1:18:52] and happy inside
[1:18:57] but now
[1:18:58] Joy it comes from a greater
[1:19:01] Source it
[1:19:04] penetrates and joy it doesn't just lie
[1:19:07] on the outside like
[1:19:11] happiness but that's something that's on
[1:19:12] the
[1:19:15] inside and the source of
[1:19:19] joy is God so Joy doesn't depend on an
[1:19:26] emotion it doesn't depend on my good
[1:19:31] circumstances you know I can have
[1:19:34] joy in
[1:19:36] pain I can have joy in the
[1:19:40] Sorrows I can have
[1:19:42] joy even in the
[1:19:47] afflictions because no matter what the
[1:19:49] trial
[1:19:51] is no matter what the sick sickness
[1:19:53] is what the heartache
[1:19:56] is if you're a son and daughter of
[1:20:00] God we should have an everlasting Joy
[1:20:03] flowing within
[1:20:07] us that's why Paul spoke about joy in
[1:20:10] the
[1:20:13] trials Peter spoke about joy in the
[1:20:17] trials James spoke about joy in the
[1:20:21] trials Jesus Jus Christ tells us to
[1:20:23] rejoice in the
[1:20:27] trials why because Joy isn't dependent
[1:20:30] on an
[1:20:33] emotion if it
[1:20:35] was my sick mom or
[1:20:38] dad my my lost job that they just fired
[1:20:44] me a church split or this or
[1:20:48] that it would crush my
[1:20:51] joy but joy is greater than
[1:20:54] happiness joy comes from a greater
[1:20:58] Source it doesn't rely on an emotion or
[1:21:01] a
[1:21:04] circumstance it is living off of the
[1:21:06] Holy Ghost
[1:21:10] itself in the Book of Job chapter
[1:21:14] 2 uh right around the 10th
[1:21:17] verse Job had just been told by his
[1:21:21] wife
[1:21:23] curse just forget about it Go Curse God
[1:21:25] and let's move on with our
[1:21:30] lives plain and simple she was
[1:21:35] blaspheming just curse God and let's get
[1:21:38] on with our
[1:21:40] lives job 2:10
[1:21:43] says but job said unto
[1:21:47] her thou speakest as a foolish woman
[1:21:51] speaketh
[1:21:55] I I I I'd like to narrate a
[1:21:58] bit how how Jo might have been a little
[1:22:01] bit in his feelings at this
[1:22:05] moment What
[1:22:07] then shall we just receive the good hand
[1:22:10] of
[1:22:12] God and we shall not receive the
[1:22:17] evil like challenging
[1:22:19] her like trying to preach to her
[1:22:24] God only gives the good and what about
[1:22:26] the
[1:22:27] bad what about the
[1:22:30] trials what about the
[1:22:33] hardships do they not come from
[1:22:37] God does God not allow us to go through
[1:22:42] them and and and you know for certain
[1:22:45] people it might sound a little a little
[1:22:49] off for job to be saying shall we not
[1:22:52] receive
[1:22:56] evil but to to to destroy that
[1:23:01] thought the Bible itself
[1:23:04] says in all this that job
[1:23:08] said he did not sin with his
[1:23:12] lips so unlike his wife who
[1:23:17] blasphemed job was saying nothing but
[1:23:19] the
[1:23:21] truth
[1:23:23] it's good to have the blessings of
[1:23:27] God but we need to take the moments of
[1:23:30] trial and tribulations
[1:23:34] also because there's a gift there's a
[1:23:36] promise there something God's trying to
[1:23:38] give
[1:23:41] us in the message I
[1:23:44] know brother Brown says it is
[1:23:47] written in one of the scriptures in the
[1:23:51] Bible says trials are brought upon us
[1:23:54] are more precious to us than gold
[1:24:01] itself for it's God giving us these
[1:24:05] trials after we become his
[1:24:09] property our confession and our
[1:24:13] baptism and our promise to walk in life
[1:24:16] for
[1:24:19] him then every trial comes up then every
[1:24:23] trial comes upon us to perfect us for
[1:24:26] his
[1:24:30] glory it's to bring us to a
[1:24:35] place where God can make himself more
[1:24:38] real to
[1:24:41] us than he was before the trial
[1:24:46] comes now if I if we could end right
[1:24:49] here and I could just ask one question
[1:24:54] question why the
[1:24:57] trials would you be able to answer that
[1:25:01] tonight I cried so many
[1:25:04] times and rad this so many
[1:25:07] times and I asked the question why the
[1:25:11] trials and I know the
[1:25:14] answer but I couldn't stop
[1:25:17] reading why the
[1:25:20] trials it is to bring bring us to a
[1:25:25] place from this
[1:25:27] place your comfort
[1:25:30] zone your prayer
[1:25:33] room your study
[1:25:36] space bring us from a
[1:25:40] place where God to bring us forgive me
[1:25:43] to a
[1:25:45] place from this place to this
[1:25:48] place where God can make himself
[1:25:54] more
[1:25:56] real he's real to every one of you
[1:26:00] tonight I believe he's real to these
[1:26:02] young people in the back
[1:26:05] tonight but he wants to be more
[1:26:09] real more real than
[1:26:12] what than he
[1:26:15] was and he's very real he's shown
[1:26:19] himself so many times in my
[1:26:21] life
[1:26:22] he wants to be more
[1:26:25] real than he was before the trial
[1:26:31] came you are a
[1:26:34] saint you're going to stand in the
[1:26:37] trial you know God is
[1:26:40] real but God wants to be more real to
[1:26:44] you and how is he going to be more real
[1:26:47] to
[1:26:48] you with each and every trial we go
[1:26:51] through
[1:26:54] so now we can
[1:26:56] see we cannot ignore the
[1:27:00] trials in our lives in our
[1:27:03] families in our churches
[1:27:06] everywhere they need to
[1:27:09] come because he wants to show you how
[1:27:11] real he
[1:27:14] is brother BR says and I want to join in
[1:27:17] this morning with
[1:27:20] joob and say I've lived long enough to
[1:27:23] know that that is the
[1:27:28] truth I've seen it in my own
[1:27:31] life I've seen that in my own
[1:27:35] life that every time a great situation
[1:27:41] Rises that I just can't get around
[1:27:45] it or go under it or go over
[1:27:49] it God makes a way
[1:27:53] and he comes out
[1:27:55] glorious I just
[1:27:59] wonder how his grace ever does
[1:28:02] it that all sufficient Grace how does it
[1:28:05] do
[1:28:07] it brother Brown says but he does
[1:28:11] it it don't matter how it's going to
[1:28:16] happen when it's going to
[1:28:18] happen the way it's going to happen
[1:28:22] but it's going to
[1:28:23] happen he's going to do it
[1:28:27] tonight we're going to start
[1:28:29] closing if the musicians would like to
[1:28:33] come the word
[1:28:35] trial the there there the definition of
[1:28:38] the word
[1:28:40] trial I found
[1:28:42] two and before we stand I just want to
[1:28:44] go through a few more notes real
[1:28:49] quick it is a test of the performance
[1:28:53] the qualities or suitability of someone
[1:28:56] or
[1:29:02] something the performance qualities or
[1:29:04] suitability of someone or
[1:29:09] something definition
[1:29:12] two is usually over a test that's
[1:29:15] usually over a limited period of
[1:29:20] time to discover how effective or
[1:29:24] suitable something or someone
[1:29:29] is so we'll get the
[1:29:32] test to see how you
[1:29:35] perform to see what Christlike qualities
[1:29:38] you
[1:29:40] carry to see if you're suitable to carry
[1:29:43] his
[1:29:45] name and that test is only for a period
[1:29:47] of
[1:29:49] time and we'll discover how how
[1:29:52] effective or suitable we
[1:29:56] are but I'm not
[1:29:59] suitable I'm not effective there's
[1:30:02] nothing good in
[1:30:04] me he is
[1:30:06] suitable he is the effective
[1:30:09] one he carries all the qualities that I
[1:30:13] need so the trial I go
[1:30:17] through I go through it with
[1:30:20] him you know there's some famous
[1:30:23] quotes it says anything worth having is
[1:30:26] worth fighting
[1:30:30] for one that's similar to that
[1:30:34] one nothing worth having comes
[1:30:39] easy humanly
[1:30:42] speaking nobody wants the
[1:30:45] trials My Flesh hates the
[1:30:48] trial but my spirit has learned learn to
[1:30:52] love the
[1:30:54] trials you know Michael
[1:30:57] Jordan Jordan if he could be the best
[1:31:00] basketball player on
[1:31:04] Earth and never have to go through a
[1:31:08] trial he'd do it and be stamped as the
[1:31:12] best you know without having the
[1:31:15] trial Muhammad Ali muhamed Ali to be the
[1:31:19] best boxer
[1:31:20] ever
[1:31:23] if he could go through it without ever
[1:31:24] having a
[1:31:27] trial he would take
[1:31:30] it but then Jesus
[1:31:33] Christ brother what does that have to do
[1:31:35] with
[1:31:37] him Jesus
[1:31:39] Christ he also had a
[1:31:42] try he also had to be
[1:31:46] tempted he is the
[1:31:48] best he is the greatest he is my idol he
[1:31:54] is my love my husband my
[1:31:57] everything not some
[1:32:00] athlete not some movie
[1:32:02] star but even in his
[1:32:08] trial in seeing that the death was
[1:32:14] necessary he said the words let this cup
[1:32:16] pass over
[1:32:18] me the scriptures in Matthew 26 he said
[1:32:22] it
[1:32:23] twice and you can all stand forgive
[1:32:27] me he said it two
[1:32:30] times when he fell on his
[1:32:34] face have you ever
[1:32:36] prayed gotten so
[1:32:39] weak and you just fall on your
[1:32:42] face and you enter in a deep prayer with
[1:32:47] God I imagine that's what Jesus Christ
[1:32:50] was doing
[1:32:54] oh my
[1:32:55] father if it be
[1:32:58] possible let this cup pass for
[1:33:02] me he he it burdened
[1:33:05] him trials were difficult for
[1:33:08] him he is the god
[1:33:11] man he is the Son of
[1:33:14] God but young people if you ever
[1:33:19] thought that Jesus Christ didn't suffer
[1:33:22] what we
[1:33:24] suffered he wasn't tempted like we were
[1:33:28] tempted strug like we
[1:33:31] struggled he saw that death was
[1:33:35] approaching he saw that death was
[1:33:39] necessary brother brandham even
[1:33:42] says in the message Souls that are in
[1:33:44] prisoned
[1:33:46] now Jesus he prayed to dodge the
[1:33:50] cross
[1:33:53] the humanity in
[1:33:55] him might have been
[1:33:57] scared might have been
[1:33:59] worried might have been
[1:34:02] reasoning because death was
[1:34:04] approaching it was a burden that was too
[1:34:06] heavy for
[1:34:08] him but in both of these scriptures in
[1:34:13] Matthew he doesn't end
[1:34:15] there that's why I kept repeating
[1:34:18] it repeating it repeating it
[1:34:23] rejoice in your
[1:34:26] trials you are blessed to have your
[1:34:29] trials because after he
[1:34:33] said let this cup pass over me I can't
[1:34:35] do
[1:34:37] this is there any other way
[1:34:41] God any other way that this can
[1:34:46] happen but if
[1:34:48] not let thy will be done
[1:34:53] let thy will be
[1:34:58] done can you heal my
[1:35:01] father but if you don't
[1:35:04] Lord let thy will be
[1:35:07] done will you bring in my son or
[1:35:12] daughter but if you don't
[1:35:15] Lord let thy will be
[1:35:19] done fix the problems Lord
[1:35:23] I can't take it no
[1:35:24] more if you
[1:35:26] don't let thy will be
[1:35:29] done please bow your heads for
[1:35:35] prayer who shall separate us from the
[1:35:38] love of
[1:35:40] Christ Brothers shall
[1:35:43] tribulation
[1:35:45] distress
[1:35:46] persecution
[1:35:48] famine nakedness Peril the sword
[1:35:53] for as it is
[1:35:55] written for thy
[1:35:57] sake we are killed all day
[1:36:02] long we are accounted as sheep at the
[1:36:07] slaughter and in all these
[1:36:10] things we are more than
[1:36:13] conquerors through him that loved
[1:36:17] us for I am
[1:36:20] persuaded
[1:36:21] that neither
[1:36:23] death nor life nor
[1:36:25] angels nor principalities nor
[1:36:28] powers nor things present nor things to
[1:36:32] come nor height nor
[1:36:35] depth nor any other
[1:36:38] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:36:41] from the love of
[1:36:45] God which is our Lord Jesus
[1:36:50] Christ
[1:36:51] there is no
[1:36:53] trial too great if you're going through
[1:36:57] the
[1:36:58] trial because you've got the
[1:37:01] strength strength that he's given
[1:37:04] you if you're going through the
[1:37:07] trial that's because he
[1:37:10] saw that there's a gift that you're
[1:37:12] going to
[1:37:14] receive not you might
[1:37:16] receive not youd like to
[1:37:19] receive but you will receive
[1:37:22] but we must
[1:37:25] overcome Lord heavenly
[1:37:27] father with hands raised this
[1:37:31] evening your word has strucken the
[1:37:34] hearts of your
[1:37:37] people Hearts have been touched
[1:37:41] tonight because we are aware
[1:37:44] Lord who does not have
[1:37:47] trials we all have trials Lord but we
[1:37:52] have a special
[1:37:54] gift we have a special
[1:37:56] word brought from a special
[1:38:00] Prophet that told us that we need the
[1:38:04] trials that there is a stature of a
[1:38:06] perfect man we're trying to
[1:38:10] achieve and in order to get there
[1:38:14] God just as job
