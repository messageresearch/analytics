this to palaura and bless your word [Music] in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen just as we're standing if we can go to matthew 16. verse 13. if you would please say amen once you have it when jesus came into the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that the son of man that i the son of man am i juanias and they said some say thou art john the baptist some elias and others jeremiah or one of the prophets and he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am responding and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god entonces jesus and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it hey man you may be seated may the lord bless the reading of his word this evening this evening i brought a message that i've titled the benefits and the consequences of revelation when i say the word consequences but consequences aren't always something negative it's also something positive and the revelation i believe that for the believer revelation is always something positive for the believer it has its benefits now first off i'd like to read what the prophet says here this is in the exposition of the seven church ages the revelation of jesus christ speaking about the devil received he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army christian if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit revelation revelation [Music] he will be as definitely thwarted today as when christ withstood every effort to gain power of him in the desert the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them it's the revelation of god that will give you the authority over the devil and you can see why they who add or take from it would be cursed because it's the revelation of jesus christ that's given to you not that it's your revelation it's the revelation he gave you because it's his word it's not our word for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of god and overcome the enemy i see is the sincere it's that simple revelation there's nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word revelation [Music] we're and sometimes it feels vamos that we're barely overcoming but we're not just going to survive we're going to prevail it produces war revelation if you receive revelation on god's behalf you will be in a war embrace i would like for the youth to understand this because revelation is something so beautiful for me personally ever since i had my experience essentially i felt as though my eyes have been opened and he does it over and over but also since my experience i've been attacked so much by the devil and i couldn't understand why yo if i was seeing these great things being so beautiful in the bible and in the message a the rock of revelation and the gates of hell no prevalence shall not prevail against it you receive a revelation the gates of hell will make the effort but they will not prevail but they will make the effort and it's not the way you think because if you look in the old you testament see that both abraham and sarah they made mistakes and it's registered in the bible but they're now in the new testament it speaks about only the good things it's not important it sees to the god already said and will we know the prophet says it's like wine have you seen a person when they receive revelation they get crazy the person goes crazy and the third time that this happened to me it was myself i found myself identified with the nathaniel porque porque jesus why because jesus saw it in division under a the first time this happened to me are you hermano there's a brother here in church he had his experience a few years ago and from then on out he's been serving the lord and that brother he has a brother in the flesh i don't want to say names because maybe the people might be a little embarrassed would tell me how it is that they had this feeling in their heart he told me things about how god would work in their family and there's a very special number for them and that's something biblical one day i was studying [Music] but honestly i wasn't really studying go to bed if you're not going to study okay okay studying science i said okay okay well it's all right she went to her bedroom then she came back once again i was on myself and she's calling me again okay stephen i said all right all right and it was that night that i found that person es hermano that brother that has now had his experience and he has a brother that's in the world i found once that there were two disciples in the bible one was running one reached its destiny first and then the other came and he arrived later there's other details as well but i went with that person and i told him that person i was told the person god bless you you know and then he continued to preach and the day that that person arrived he arrived late why because the scripture has to be fulfilled it's something that i would really like for the youth to understand if you receive a revelation el diablo the devil will come to attack you after especially after i received my experience it was a friday evening i had to get to a certain place to perform a certain job but i was distracted in my mind so i took an exit i shouldn't have taken it when i noticed i got off on the wrong exit to and as you already know the right lane is the slow lane and as we all know us here from phoenix we like to drive fast and i saw many they kind of put their head down but that right lane was going a little slow so i turn my head to look and see if i can get in the left lane once i turn my head and my car was going to smash into a sign i received three three impacts i remember i received three impacts but when i got off the car my car showed that i was only hit once those vessels are hit twice on this part right here in the front left and then on the side but that last impact that struck me from behind it made me avoid that sign noise and not crash into the signs because i would have crashed then that sign would have bent over and it would have crushed me and what is it that happened the devil got angry revelation produces war do i repent from the decision that i made no no loss beneficials it's the revelation of jesus christ personally to you el prophet the prophet himself says that the new birth it's a revelation and myself in these last days i was just asking myself i believe that's a good way to take the prophet's words to believe him though we don't understand and the lord in his grace he'll allow us to understand afterwards and i would ask myself well why did the prophet say it like this then i remember the scriptures in first john 5 4. remember the new birth is a revelation first john 5 4. yes for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith what does the prophet say faith is revelation he says this is the victory that overcometh the world our faith is whatsoever is born of the world of god overcometh the world and the way that you overcome the world is through your faith and faith is revelation porque now it is a revelation for the revelation is faith you cannot have a revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him as though it wasn't so our faith now faith that's what faith is it's the revelation of god revelation the church is built upon a revelation the whole entire body because the revelation produces action produces action how many times have we told the sisters about the skirts and the heels and how many times have we told them that they need to compose themselves correctly how many times but when it produces it's distinct when god accepts it one could say they've got it but when god says you've got it it's because that's how it is i would like to show you in daniel chapter 10. how it is the revelation produces war daniel daniel 10 1 says in the third year of cyrus king of persia a thing was revealed unto daniel whose name was called belteshazar and the thing was true but the time appointed was long and he understood the thing and he had understanding of the vision but in spanish it says a word was revealed and in spanish it also says there was a great conflict now we're going to jump to verse 12. then said he unto me fear not daniel for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand and to chasten thyself before thy god the words were heard and i am come for thy words because the bible says that the eyes of the lord is us but the prince of the kingdom of persia withstood me and 20 days one in 20 days but lo michael one of the chief princes came to help me and i remain there with the kings of persia persona i know that everyone here when they pray immediately sometimes feel as though the answer comes immediately and then sometimes the person feels when they pray okay nothing happens then the devil immediately comes with the answer no we know that the prince is the son of a king those that govern those that govern a people in verse 1 it's a cyrus but there's a prince that controls that king the bible says brother branham also says the devil is the prince of the powers of the air branham and what does brother branham say that the devil controls every government in the world so you've got to understand the principles but it speaks of princes what now the bible also says that there are princes on the devil's side there's but the prince of the kingdom of persia would stood me one in 20 days but lo michael uno de los principales principes one of the chief princes there's not just one prince principles there's many principles because there's many governments now because of the time and many times people depend upon the preacher but the revelation doesn't just come from the preacher the revelation comes to you you can receive revelation now i am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days for yet the vision is for many days greatly beloved fear not peace be unto thee be strong ye be strong and when he had spoken unto me i was strengthened and said let my word speak for thou has strengthened me el principede then he then said he knowest thou wherefore i come unto thee and now will i return to fight with the prince of persia and when i am gone forth lo the prince of greece shall come aura pueden verde of peace it says that melchizedek is the prince of pete is the king of peace and what did jesus say when he was here on the earth my peace i give unto you his piece is genuine now notice what the brother brandon says in the message at thy word some time ago it was two couple of women in the meeting and when on the platform the lord i don't know whether she's at the platform or in laudence anyhow the words spoke out thus saith the lord that you're healed told her to go eat anything she wanted to observe watch that when he speaks that ain't me but thus saith the lord and so the woman went home to try to eat it and when she did she liked to die now remember the the answer doesn't always come immediately i and it's not that god doesn't want to answer me it's because there's spirits that come against that spirit they want to heal you they want to respond to you and finally that angel comes and confirms his word and the angel will come with the confirmation of that word she had an awful case of it it went on for several days fresco pasar and one morning she feels something cool passed right through her yeah weeks later yeah and she began to eat todd it was all right cuando when diesel maron diesel ranking she run down the street to tell her neighbor and her neighbor that had a big lump in her throat so there were and when this woman went to see the neighbor from ella corrio brother brown said she ran down the street to tell her neighbor that had a big lump on her throat led and the lord had spoke to her and said that she was going to be well thus saith the lord and then when she went out to see her establish she found her neighbor just screaming at the top of her voice the lump had just left her throat entonces so then what happened aquista here was declared see sometimes they don't get it on the spur danielo a spur of the moment daniel prayed fuel the angel said it was 21 days i believe before it was right anthony but you stay with the word of god just wait wait upon the lord will renew their strengths what happened to daniel yeah the angel gabriel came to him just a trumpet is sounded to summon an army into battle to get into that battle and first corinthians 14 8 it says for if a trump had given uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle prophet the prophet says in the message revelation chapter four number either a revelation significant then the spiritual war begins when someone receives the revelation of the new birth experience he confirms the experience with the revealed word says this is that which was prophesied by the prophet joel espiritu then in the he attacks the authenticity of it because the word is authentic but our faith has to be tested if we believe it or not if you receive the revelation of the new birth and the trumpet sounds and the prophet says in the message uh is this the sign of the sir is this the end of the signs of the end time the sounding and the sounding of a trumpet in the bible means get ready for spiritual war but we're not in the literal war the majority of our battle is con el diablo it's with the devil about the word the revealed word that god gave us it's a spiritual or not it's a spiritual war or scriptural war preparation in the bible it means get ready for a scriptural war lost if you want to put this down first corinthians 14 8. if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound how will a man know what to prepare for enemies in the message the feast of the trumpets the trumpet sounded in the trumpet denotes either war or a feast day or what it means is a gathering together of the people pablo dijo paul said that when a trumpet gives an uncertain sound queen who can prepare themselves for war or for peace or whatever it is who knows you have to know what the trumpet sounds the but there's also princes on jesus christ jesus himself is a prince the the prophet says in the message the mighty conqueror diablo this earth belonged to the devil through the fall this earth was given to the devil diablo every kingdom of this world is governed by the devil we hate to think that but the bible says it is that's the reason we have wars and shooting and fighting in trouble it's because the kingdoms of this world is the kingdoms of the devil the bible said so for the kingdoms of this earth have become the kingdoms of our lord and he shall rule and reign forever now they will when jesus literally will become a prince of this world no abraham there will be no more war when but to prevail and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth where this scripture will be manifested literally the governments of this world will not always be governed by the devil jesus christ of the kings of the earth because even today nothing happens unless he first of all allows it he's the prince the governor of the kings of the earth yes satan controls them but first he goes and asks for permission feed the flock of god which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly not by filthy lucker but of but of a ready mind no common sense neither is being lords over god's heritage but being examples of the flock and when the chief shepherd shall appear you shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away a prince is a governor in england and in english it says the chief of the shepherds the prince and a prince is a chief one that governs for example i'm going to use your brothers for example he's the pastor here of our church but he has a chief jesus christ jesus christ every pastor of every church no puerto de clara cannot declare himself as the prince of the pastor he just to clear it up for you a little bit more ensembles in psalms 23 1 it says my pastor the lord is my shepherd i shall not want me david himself he was a pastor of the sheep but he also had a pastor he was my pastor the lord is my shepherd the lord of the old testament jehovah of the old testament is the same of jesus of the new testament i hope you don't think questions jesus isn't jesus christ is not just a prince but he's a prince charming because the way that he directs himself to the bride governs though yes he does govern is a principle but he's a prince charm he has very special attention toward us those are your revelations and there that bride is looking for the coming of the lord jesus christ which that secret secret coming of the lord secret coming of christ shall come and catch away his bride in the night come on libro julieta like a book i read of romeo and juliet one time how he came with the ladder and he got his bride out among them that's what jesus will come someday looking for that one who's looking who's not looking to his creeds but looking to christ waiting for him to come with his heart centered because the center of our heart is but there's something that we share between us it's a deep calling to another deep christ does vindicate his word which attracts the people because christ has his personal uh his specific liking is he don't attract the people he don't attract the people at churches that are attracted by big denominations and big and big doings and great big carry-ons and fancy things but the word of god attracts the bride of christ if you've got a genuine attraction for christ it's the word of god in specifically now notice it's interesting to notice how that the church tries to attract the attention of the people by fine ropes and dress choirs and think nothing about it and that's what they think that it's all right that's beautiful but you see eso that's false that's not the word of and the way that you can keep his after this i looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which i heard as it were trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show you these things which would be hereafter it says i saw una puerta vietnam uh behold a door that was opened in heaven because there's a mutual attraction between him and us it's a deep from up there trying to reveal himself to the deep that's right here up there trying to which is that will the veterans will be there with their battle scars thomas gusta we don't like war but it has to happen the bible has to be fulfilled don't go thankful with the lord that got you out of that but your desire that you would have never done it to start off with completely the prophets it has to be fulfilled we'll show the scars just like jesus did necessarily but there are some that are unnecessary there's many here that could tell you the same thing don't do it though it seems very attractive no it's an attraction if the traction is not to christ in that attraction is a distraction is a distraction you don't have to do it but if you do it he'll [Music] if you just put your attraction on christ the prophet says okay because and i found a quote from the prophet of the new year in the year 61. he says granted lord consider granted again i've bringing them to the anointing of the holy spirit that on that day they might come from me from the east and west brianna shininess gems in your crown are you help me lord to go down and protect and dig them
