each and every one of you in the precious name of our lord jesus christ it's so good to be here and to just fellowship under the spirit and fellowship under the word amen amen amen let us go straight to our scriptures if you would like to turn with me to saint john 17 verses 20 to 23. i spoke on a message called the division of one brings unity to all men and uh we're gonna try to finish it and the bible says neither i pray neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word that they all may be one as thou father are me and i in thee and that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has and the glory which thou gavest me i have given them that they may be one even as we are one gloria i in them and thou and me that they may be perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them and thou hast loved me heavenly father father celestial lord we just want to give you the glory and the honor gloria father we we come here already and expecting father father lord without you father we can open up the scriptures but you bring the revelation lord lord we can come here and worship but you'd bring the deliverance father you are the one that brings down eternal blessings so lord we come here fellowshipped under the blood of jesus christ knowing father that your word you are obligated to come and to give to the children whatever they need father savion lord so we commit ourselves into your hands each and every person here personally in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and amen amen amen amen you may be seated i spoke on um this message a few months ago and spoke on how in god god had his attributes in him but the bible or brother branham says that he desired fellowship he was god and god alone but in him he had attributes to be father son savior healer salvatore and he had attributes which were you and i we are his attributes today we were in him in his mind before the foundation of the world or he divided himself brother branham said that he gave birth to the logos and that was his son and that was his program from then all the way to the end that he divides himself and he fellowships not with somebody else but with himself i once heard a brother once say he said god doesn't have a family he says so in order to fellowship perfectly with god you have to be in him that is god fellowshipping with himself his family he divides himself in adam and eve and has perfect oneness all in one accord through the holy spirit brother branham says this of branham in the message oneness and his purpose as father supreme was to be um with his family earthly family adam and eve is and the only way he could be one with his family or with god because god's nature was in them that's the only way we can be one with our family and with god is when and god they become all one espos they were all one todos by the spirit of the holy ghost that's the only way that's as simple as it gets his true unity is through the holy spirit but we see that in genesis 2 17 vemos and genesis that god gave them a commandment now the law was perfect in that time and god didn't give them 613 laws god gave them one thing to obey god told them you can eat of all of these fruits you can do anything you want to do you are god on the earth just don't touch that tree one thing brother or the bible says an amazing quote here that obedience is better than sacrifice and for me that scripture has always uh confused me and many people say well it's like this is that obedience to obey god is better than sacrificing yourself and giving him sacrifices that's not what the bible says he says it's better than the slain lamb well how could anything be better than jesus christ on the cross well in the original in the beginning and they had the nature to follow that obedience but that perfect sacrifice jesus christ was not like a sacrifice of lambs bulls and goats where where they had to sacrifice and sacrifice and sacrifice when he was the sacrifice of sacrifices he brought us back to the beginning because that perfect sacrifice came so that we can come back next year and cover them again he wiped them completely away and not only that but he put his own spirit back in you so that perfect fellowship and the bible says the day you eat thereof is the day you die brother branham says in this message it shall be even as it was told to me uh some men's sins go before um before them and some follow algonos let's confess ours now confess and god in the garden of eden when he pronounced death upon the human race and death means separation represents separation that's the reason we call it death for one another we separate from one another god says the day you eat thereof is the day you die and the unity broke he said because they separated from god they were separated from god from that holy spirit and they were dead spiritually and and the bible says that that god kicked him out of the garden of eden kicked them out from the tree of life brother branham says when man sin in the garden of eden he crossed a great chasm separating himself from an eternal one he separated himself from eternal life he separated himself from that dimension where he was in dimension because the garden of eden was still there god just separated him himself from them and in reality that's what happens when we die physically we're separated from one another when i can go to the grave and i i could see the remains of the one that i lost and when man crossed that great chasm god kicked him into the three dimensions living under the fourth and god separating the dimensions so that they can't go into the holy presence of god anymore that throne was what the seventh dimension is god would lay us in his bosom and put them to sleep [Music] [Music] and and the bible says that he put cherubims around and he kept him away it is brother branham says in fellowship with god through reconciliation reconciliation and i can see them turn away from god there you come and i can see adam as he starts walking away and eve around his arm around eve as they started to walk out through the garden of eden and the great jehovah god standing there walking away from eternity i can see all the great endless eternities they were walking away from all of it he wasn't subject to dimensions he could go from there to here he was a multi-dimensional creature he he was an eternal creature and then imagine this eternal creature all right being subject to death the bible says death reigned over them the fourth dimension but if you notice as redemption becomes greater than we go to the five if we were under the blood of bulls and goats vamos a la quinta but whenever jesus christ shed his blood he allowed the saints to go to the sixth dimension and now every single person goes to the sixth dimension and whenever all things become new again the bible says in revelations 22 21 and 22 22. we will be in that seventh dimension the bible says that heavens and earth will be embraced falling from the heavens it literally paralyzed the earth literally it throwed every creature on earth and all of god's creation in bondage and man was under bondage of sickness and death and all those things that's what state that people are in today it's one of the greatest days when um he ascended up um cause or he is send it up because all over the earth since that day in the garden of eden that sin was committed all heavens was shut off from mankind satan is the prince of the power of the air principle fourth no man could understand because the power is just above it heaven means atmosphere cielo significant atmosphere atmosphere above and all these powers are shut off from mankind because of sin so he's saying that the fourth dimension or the that that place where saint dwells is an atmosphere right above us and it shut all humanity away from that presence of god and there was no true unity but if you would like to turn with me to genesis 11. volterra de genesis the bible says and the earth was of one language and one speech we see a unity there but it was false because the spirit of god wasn't in them anymore we see this place they were of one language and one speech is now in the book of the seven church ages the pergy mean church age position brother says this babylon has always been literally and figuratively his heck his headquarters he's talking about satan it was the city of babylon that satanic worship had its origin babylonia all false unity begins in babylon commence in babylonia all false religion today religion comes from babylon babylonia comes from the tower of babel [Music] to give back to god amen amen the bible says in verse 2 it says and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east they found a plane in the land of shinar that they dwelt there and they do out there and they said to one another go to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly that they may they had and they had brick for stone and slime had they for mortar is and let's see what it says in verse 4. and they said go to let us build a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven and let us make a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earthquake brother branham says in um fellowship with god through reconciliation [Music] god longs for fellowship he yearns he wants people to speak with him to talk with him by himself solo he saw himself sevilla and when he saw him alone he said it's not good for man to be alone because he felt that feeling because he desired fellowship with his children that's god's heart's desire so that we could be one so that we could have perfect fellowship with one another but that's not the way god did it god doesn't achieve fellowship so or it doesn't use fellowship to achieve something no us the goal is fellowship la meta is so that i could be one with you so i can get something back from you they were in one mind established and they use that fellowship yosaranese companerismo so that they can get to god but they said let us come together god said multiply and replenish the earth god said to scatter they said no let's come together because god's fellowship is different than man's fellowship companies we think we have to be under one church we think we have to be under one head we see that in in the catholicism we see that in denominations do we see that in the message oh i'm not going to say anything you know what i said now but that's the way man's fallen nature is yes that's man's fallen nature let's come together let's be under one head it says for the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the lord gloria as the waters cover the sea man that water covers the majority of this earth god wants his glory to be spread abroad unity is not coming together and building the tower of babylon and he wants his glory to be filled all if i'm in mexico and you're here by one spirit by one spirit we are all baptized into one body by one spirit but they try to fellowship under this tower they use the very thing god yearns for so that they can reach up to heaven it says amen amen they said let us make a name for ourselves let us go up to heaven that sounds a whole lot like lucifer i will ascend to heaven i will sit on the sides of the north yo establish i will be like the most high yo it was a demonic unity good intentions maybe and the bible says in in verse 5 of genesis and the lord came down to see the city and the tower whose the children of men build us and the lord said behold the people is won and they all have one language and this they begin to do and now now listen to this now nothing will restrain them from them nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do yes nothing nada unity is powerful even if it's controlled by the devil there's nothing that would constrain them from what they wanted to achieve go to let us go down and confound the language that they may not understand with another speech so the lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of the earth and they left off to build therefore the name of this uh the name of it uh of it called babel because the lord did confound their language of all the earth and from thence the lord scattered them abroad the face of all the earth brother branham says in the unity of god in one church in 1958 now they build a tower which i doubt that modern science could build today so they they were way smarter than us they were which all their machineries and things because they were united together they had one mind one soul one purpose one motive one objective that's build a tower so high that if god could ever took a notion to destroy them again they'd run right into heaven with him wow and they've been there there'd be no way that they could keep him from doing it or he could keep them from doing it as they thought and and we find out then that they organize themselves together and we find them completely out of the will of god in contra complex isn't that a beautiful picture of this day when men are trying to unite together we try we should be united we sh and we should be united but they're uniting under the wrong system did you ever notice how the devil patterns off the things of did you ever see that how he takes the things that god has purposed the devil patterns everything just like god el diablo now i have a question we don't you guys don't have to answer if you have the answer you can say it response how high was the tower of babel how high was it there was one time they said that a russian astronaut he went beyond the atmosphere atmosphere he went beyond the orbit of the earth and he said well where's your heaven you're talking about it you keep pointing up there and he said where is your god there is no god up here and maybe that was a rebuke to many christians [Music] christians say wow i i got it wrong here why don't we make you okay is right here in a faster dimension so that we [Music] so how high was the tower of babel these men the bible said brother brown says that they were completely smarter than us and we dumb people already know that there's no heaven up there nosotros it was a pyramid it was a pyramid and and they barely found out yeah pena they found a tablet [Music] a stone tablet nebuchadnezzar ii and they had a pyramid right next to him and those pyramids they go down like steps brother branham says that's the same exact uh pyramid that enoch made this element he said he made a seven stepped pyramids and brother berlin says that that pyramid that's holy city this is and the the river of life was strickling right down through it and in this tablet when they found it they could read the description on the bottom podium and it was showing that nebuchadnezzar ii was trying to rebuild the tower of babylon and it was showing that the tower of babel was there with them still and he was trying to rebuild it but he wasn't trying to build a great big tower that's sunday school cool coloring book stuff libros de las clas amen amen so it was a pyramid you know the first bible was the stars the stars were there all the constellations were there and then the second bible was built by enoch which was a pyramid brother branham says and those pyramids if you look into it astrologically built so that they can reach up to the stars the bible says that he walked with god and one day he was found not anymore he was lifted up somewhere somehow fueled how trying to reach heaven not all the way up to heaven they were trying to reach a dimension they were smaller than us and us as dumb as we are [Music] that science found out that cancer was a four-dimensional disease [Music] on your chest it's a devil diablo and we have men going behind the brother brethren says behind god's laboratory hey this is they're doing it as we speak they did it in the 1960s when brother branham preached it contacting the fourth dimension so here these people are trying to get into heaven well we know what babel means it means confusion significa confusion but if you dissect that word if is elohim so whenever you hear l in the bible like bethlehem it means the house of god's bread this la casa del panderios el means god el significados now the word you you can look it up it is means amen amen brother branham says in the messages i'm sorry i don't have them up here this is and that's what churches do today we're trying to achieve heaven through a false unity unity is what god desires [Music] it will always lead to confusion amen amen and that was the state of the tower of babel yes but there was a man brother branham says that was there he was there at the tower of babel he was there in babylon in babylonia his name was abram and god says get out of that country leave your parents leave all that idolatry leave all that false religion and come even and i will bless you and in you ent and in you and all families of the earth shall be blessed what's god's program the division of one la division uno brings unity to all god separates yo and he brings unity to all through that separation or that emptying of himself so he got one man out of your loins out of you all of the earth will be blessed and your your your seed will be like the sands of the earth of the sea amen he was bringing back true unity through one man he said out of your people they said pueblo there's going to be one mind one spirit one accord and god separated that righteous man and that's our calling today yesterday he said babylon has fallen they say al-qaeda babylonia [Music] [Music] and it's become the habitation [Music] have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of our delicacies same commission that he gave abraham and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her okay come out of her my people partakers of her sins participated that ye shall not receive her plagues for her sins have reached unto heaven and and he said i will go down there they say and i will confound them and confuse them and while they were all in a confused state he had arraignment there he had a all and uh if god's willing we'll we'll finish it up next time amen let us bow our heads heavenly father father celestial lord we just want to give you the glory and the honor of glory lord we want to be under your head father lord we want every single person in this lord i want my family to be under you father so that we can achieve perfect fellowship fathers lord we desire that one another be together under your we thank you we give you the glory gloria in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and amen amen [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Music] m [Music] so [Music] so [Music] god [Music] is [Music] foreign [Music] because he lives i can face tomorrow [Music] god he came

love them [Music] is [Music] hey [Music] we come to the end of our service he found my lot to put out the fire we're going to pray to dismiss but before we have two announcements the we're asking everyone to be very cautious when they're exiting this place like they said earlier when we're reversing our cars out the drivers can be cautious when they're reversing for any kids or any adults anybody behind them and take your time when you're exiting towards the streets trafficking and also when we're exiting onto the street that we be cautious of the traffic on rozier be cautious of anybody passing by we don't cause an accident also they're asking when we enter in this into the sanctuary especially especially here in the entrance uh sometimes we're a little comfortable with speaking and greeting each other right right in the vegetable and says if we can be a little more reverent as we're going to be seated at the benches there might be somebody praying or worshiping or reading their bible and i'm speaking to somebody there or shaking their hand greeting them and that can upset the spirit here that's in the sanctuary you can stand with me and we'll be praying to dismiss the service vendito first of all because you permit us another day of life this place where we may congregate and lord what more can we say of your word this morning we only ask that you help us to stay standing on your word but the promise you have given unto us that you would be with us until the end of the world and in this morning lord we place ourselves in your hands [Music] we'd like to dismiss us in this place we and we ask these things in the sweet name of your son amen amen [Music] standing on the promises christ my [Music] glory is [Music] by the living word of on god promises [Music] so [Music] you
