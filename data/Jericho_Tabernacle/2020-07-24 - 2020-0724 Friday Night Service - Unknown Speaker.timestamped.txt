[20:27] amen amen amen may the lord
[20:30] uh bless you this evening is
[20:34] it's truly nice to be in the house of
[20:36] the lord
[20:40] you know we might not have a
[20:44] big physical audience
[20:56] you know i'm not sure if i heard it from
[20:58] brother branham or for someone else
[21:00] no cece
[21:05] the angels that are taking in the pews
[21:07] and they're
[21:08] they're witnessing what we're talking
[21:09] about
[21:14] is
[21:28] trust that he always has towards myself
[21:34] to always stand behind his pulpit and to
[21:36] speak to the flock
[21:41] and to the to the youth i think it's
[21:44] even more
[21:45] uh scarier i guess when it comes down to
[21:48] the youth
[21:52] because you can't go too hard
[21:55] hospital and you can't be too easy
[21:59] you got to find yourself right down the
[22:01] middle somewhere
[22:04] so i i i thank brother alvarado that he
[22:06] sees that enemy to do that
[22:10] juanito quebeco
[22:16] i'm going to open up our scriptures to
[22:18] the book of saint matthew
[22:23] it's uh it's found on the sixth chapter
[22:27] verse 30 i'm going i would like to
[22:32] to continue of what we spoke about
[22:36] approximately about a month ago
[22:38] approximately
[22:50] it's too much it's too wide
[22:53] to bring it to one or two messages
[22:59] and i always see that the lord compares
[23:01] the kingdom several times
[23:07] jesus says where can i like onto the
[23:09] kingdom
[23:10] jesus here he says the kingdom is like
[23:14] on two they say uh el reyno es como
[23:17] and then he says and then another
[23:18] scripture says the kingdom is like on
[23:20] too
[23:21] dice el reyno escomo so it's very wide
[23:25] it
[23:25] says stencil and uh last time we spoke
[23:28] about
[23:29] putting seeking first the kingdom
[23:32] ultimately
[23:43] 30th verse says wherefore if god so
[23:47] clothed the grass of the field
[23:49] which today is and tomorrow is cast into
[23:53] the oven
[23:54] shall he not much more clothe you o ye
[23:57] of little faith
[24:09] therefore take no thought saying what
[24:11] shall we eat
[24:12] or what shall what shall we eat or what
[24:15] shall we drink
[24:16] or what shall we be clothed
[24:24] for after all these things that the
[24:26] gentiles seek
[24:27] for your heavenly father knoweth that he
[24:29] have need of all these things
[24:38] but seek first the kingdom of god and
[24:41] his righteousness
[24:43] and all these things shall be added on
[24:45] to you
[24:53] amen may the lord add blessings to his
[24:55] word
[24:59] and i want to say it to the invisible
[25:02] audience
[25:05] that i hope you're all doing well
[25:09] we trust in the lord that this too shall
[25:13] pass
[25:15] but uh i think the lord watches over us
[25:21] uh my base scripture me uh
[25:25] that i would like to kind of focus on
[25:26] tonight
[25:29] it's going to be found in saint john
[25:31] it's encountered in
[25:32] juan the third chapter el capitolo
[25:35] and uh i will start reading or i'll
[25:38] start making emphasis on the first verse
[25:57] to continue what we spoke about a month
[25:59] ago
[26:03] i like to entitle it as understanding
[26:06] how to enter
[26:08] intending here on the
[26:11] saint john the third chapter in san juan
[26:14] el capitolo
[26:15] we find a pharisee a queen controversial
[26:18] by the name of nicodemus nicodemus and
[26:21] he was a ruler of the jews
[26:25] and he came onto jesus by nighttime
[26:31] what i like to do i like to focus every
[26:33] little word that the scripture says
[26:50] he didn't come to jesus during that the
[26:51] day el no jesus durante
[26:54] uh he didn't want to be seen he didn't
[26:57] want to be seen from uh
[26:59] for all the pharisees to see that he was
[27:01] talking to jesus
[27:14] so therefore this pharisee nicodemus is
[27:18] quickly right off the bat
[27:22] the first word he tells jesus
[27:29] he gave him respect and he says we know
[27:33] that thou art a teacher come from god
[27:38] he didn't say i nicodemus
[27:43] he says no
[27:46] we all
[28:00] so then jesus directs himself to him
[28:02] respond jesus
[28:04] he says
[28:08] except a man be born again
[28:12] he cannot see the kingdom of god
[28:24] he finds himself kind of tangled to what
[28:27] jesus just said
[28:42] time except the man be born again
[28:45] except he didn't understand what jesus
[28:49] just said
[28:51] jesus so then on the fifth verse
[28:54] we find that jesus breaks it down just a
[28:56] little bit more
[28:57] jesus he says accept
[29:01] a man he says be born of water
[29:04] nazca del agua and of the spirit
[29:08] he cannot enter into the kingdom
[29:23] nicodemus being a pharisee didn't
[29:25] understand nicodemus
[29:27] so then jesus broke it down just a bit
[29:29] more for him and jesus
[29:32] he says accept a man be born of water
[29:37] and of spirit he cannot enter in the
[29:40] kingdom of god
[29:43] to me i me myself i see five things
[29:48] i see born again
[29:52] i see
[30:34] now in order for someone to be born
[30:36] spiritually
[30:39] in order for there to be a new birth
[30:44] i see that we need three elements
[30:47] we need to be justified we need to be
[30:50] sanctified
[30:52] and we need the holy spirit
[30:55] we need these three things
[30:59] to see the kingdom
[31:02] to enter
[31:09] [Music]
[31:12] and here i start to study i say how can
[31:14] it be that a man can be born of water
[31:26] so if we go to romans the sixth chapter
[31:30] vamos a
[31:34] here is the apostle paul speaking to the
[31:36] romans
[31:39] he says know he not that so many of us
[31:43] as were baptized into jesus christ were
[31:45] baptized into his death
[31:53] therefore we are buried with him by
[31:56] baptism into death
[31:58] that like as christ was raised up from
[32:00] the dead by the glory of the father
[32:02] even so we also shall walk in the
[32:04] newness of life
[32:18] now before we can be born again
[32:21] the first thing we need to do is to
[32:22] repent
[32:26] the apostle peter says in acts 238
[32:30] he says repent and be
[32:34] baptized in the name of jesus christ
[32:39] so now jesus says except the man be born
[32:41] of water
[32:42] jesus so we went to romans chapter 6
[32:48] chapter 3 and 4. he says
[32:51] therefore we are buried with him junta
[32:54] mente
[33:32] you don't have someone's toes sticking
[33:33] up out of the ground
[33:36] um
[33:39] or you go walking in the graveyard in
[33:41] the cemetery
[33:44] and you see the dead man with his hand
[33:46] sticking up out of the grave
[33:54] that's why when the minister is
[33:56] baptizing the repentant sinner
[34:00] he has to make sure that all of his
[34:04] bodies
[34:18] by baptism
[34:33] oh in the name of the lord jesus christ
[34:37] the minister has to make sure that his
[34:38] body is covered
[34:44] because the pastor says
[34:57] that's why jesus says accept a man be
[35:00] born
[35:17] i love how the word just it it points
[35:20] jesus everywhere
[35:24] jesus you might say brother the new
[35:26] birth again
[35:38] and speak about the new birth from
[35:39] genesis all the way to revelation in the
[35:41] genesis has
[35:50] so now we understand what jesus said
[35:55] because the holy spirit through the
[35:56] apostle paul
[35:59] on the letter to the romans
[36:03] he says we are buried that's why every
[36:07] inch of that repentant sinner's body has
[36:09] to be covered in water
[36:37] i remember i asked brother
[36:50] oh she wants to read the bible she wants
[36:52] to read she wants to listen to the tapes
[36:56] i said that's amazing that's how it is
[36:59] with every repented sinner
[37:03] and it is naturally yeah
[37:06] you're in the hot
[37:21] what happens we get dirty again
[37:26] oh i just love the word i mean oh yeah
[37:29] we could take a nice
[37:30] cold shower
[37:34] being outside in the hot heat of arizona
[37:42] and that's the error of the new convert
[37:45] yes
[37:47] i'm clean
[37:57] oh lord i love the word now let's go to
[37:59] first peter
[38:01] de pedro first peter the third chapter
[38:05] uh the 20th verse here's the apostle
[38:08] peter now talking
[38:10] apostle pedro he says which sometimes
[38:12] we're disobedient
[38:14] when once the long suffering of god
[38:16] waited in the days of noah
[38:18] while the ark was preparing wearing few
[38:21] that is
[38:22] eight souls were saved by water
[38:30] enough
[38:39] so what is the path to peter saying
[38:41] pedro
[38:42] he says that is eight souls
[38:53] figure we're on to even baptism also now
[38:56] save us
[39:02] by the resurrection of jesus christ
[39:06] he says just like it saved noah salvo
[39:10] the baptism also saves us el bautism
[39:15] [Applause]
[39:43] it says we are buried with him but we
[39:44] resurrected new life
[39:50] and just like it saved noah it saves me
[39:55] but i like the scripture
[39:58] i kind of see it like this
[40:02] the apostle peter says we're on to even
[40:05] the baptism
[40:05] also now saves us correspond
[40:46] then jesus says in saint john 3 5.
[40:50] jesus juan tres cinco except the man be
[40:52] born of water
[40:53] and this is the agua e
[40:57] there's where we fell i is on the field
[41:00] because we want to stay in the shadow of
[41:02] the cross
[41:04] permanently
[41:29] get on the cross and be crucified
[42:00] why we need to go to saint matthew
[42:06] the third chapter that's what brother
[42:09] branham says
[42:11] you grab a little pig
[42:18] you can have the best soap out there
[42:22] you can even have one of those water
[42:24] compressors to wash the 18 wheelers
[42:55] and you can start calling him cute
[42:57] little names
[42:59] oh louise you're so beautiful you look
[43:01] you're a little clean now all right
[43:03] vestan lindo you see how i gave it a
[43:05] name
[43:06] becomes oh luis you look so clean now
[43:09] oh luis aura tv
[43:15] you could put a rope on them you could
[43:16] put them on a cage
[43:20] but the moment you let him go for a
[43:22] moment
[43:23] he's gonna run through the first pile of
[43:25] mud the full pile of dirt he sees
[43:30] that's what apostle peter says it does
[43:32] not take away the filth
[43:34] of the flesh foreign
[43:45] see i read saint john three li san juan
[43:49] first peter three primarily saint
[43:52] matthew 3.
[43:54] perfection here's the here's john the
[43:58] baptist
[44:00] who was the elijah of that time
[44:05] he said i indeed baptize you with water
[44:10] in agua onto repentance
[44:14] but he that cometh after me
[44:19] is mightier than i
[44:46] he was the prophet
[45:02] shall baptize you
[45:05] with the holy ghost and espirito santo
[45:08] and
[45:08] with fire if fuego except the man
[45:14] be born of water the agua acts 238 2 38.
[45:18] and of spirits be baptized
[45:23] and receive the gift of the holy ghost
[45:28] that's why john said i baptize you with
[45:30] fire with water
[45:36] he's talking about the lord habla del
[45:38] signora the lord jesus christ
[45:40] of christ
[45:44] the word ghost and spirit are similar
[45:47] aura
[45:50] holy ghost and with fire it is
[45:54] fuego that is what's going to take away
[45:56] the filth of the flesh
[46:11] of the spirit evil spirit now notice

[56:14] now we understand how to be born again
[56:16] all right
[56:18] we just talked about it but brother
[56:21] branham says
[56:27] that's why my title this evening
[56:31] understanding how to enter es
[56:36] we spoke about how to enter
[56:39] but the hardest thing for someone
[57:48] how this prophet could be telling a a
[57:50] woman's issue
[57:52] a prophet
[58:06] but
[58:27] now i want to zero in just a little bit
[58:30] more on
[58:31] understanding intending
[58:48] kingdom but he gives the answer
[58:54] but he that do with the will of my
[58:57] father
[59:00] then i find in matthew 12. encuentro in
[59:03] matteo dossey on the 47th first to the
[59:05] 50th
[59:10] they told jesus jesus
[59:14] there's your mother to mother there's
[59:16] your brother that's
[59:24] for whosoever shall do the will of my
[59:27] father
[59:28] which is in heaven is my brother and
[59:44] jesus says whosoever doeth the will of
[59:47] my
[59:47] father jesus
[59:51] now here's two things
[59:55] and my father now not my carnal
[59:59] father i know my father carnal
[1:00:00] biological but my spiritual father
[1:00:03] is father spiritual jesus christ jesus
[1:00:06] christ he said oh rather god jesus
[1:00:08] saying the will of my father
[1:00:14] i'm going to zero in just a little bit
[1:00:15] more concentrate
[1:00:19] sometimes we don't understand
[1:00:23] why god does things to us
[1:00:27] [Music]
[1:00:39] but that's why jesus says except the man
[1:00:41] be born again
[1:00:45] he cannot understand the kingdom el
[1:00:48] reyno
[1:00:49] and that's his will yes you got to be
[1:00:51] born again
[1:00:53] you gotta be born again
[1:00:56] [Music]
[1:01:57] sometimes i want that
[1:02:00] my for my brother
[1:02:03] or i don't have any kids
[1:02:06] but sometimes but i am a son
[1:02:10] sometimes the parents want the kids to
[1:02:13] do
[1:02:13] their will
[1:02:18] and they don't allow their kids to do
[1:02:20] their
[1:02:21] father's will
[1:02:27] we want to say no
[1:02:30] i don't want you doing this
[1:02:45] and the only way that god can speak to
[1:02:47] us today
[1:02:50] of course through his tapes
[1:02:53] of course through his holy spirit uh
[1:02:55] claro por medio del sol espiritu
[1:02:57] when the pastor says i want you to come
[1:03:00] and help me
[1:03:14] i don't want you to go with them holy
[1:03:15] rollers
[1:03:17] i want you to do my will
[1:03:21] i don't want you to do the heavenly
[1:03:23] father's will
[1:03:26] what happens when
[1:03:41] because when we're doing god's
[1:03:55] what if that's god's perfect
[1:05:06] not
[1:05:20] they don't
[1:06:44] again especially if you understand why
[1:06:47] god did the other
[1:06:48] son because you're not born again
[1:06:53] in order for us to understand
[1:06:56] we must be born again is
[1:07:12] things
[1:07:26] oh things
[1:07:39] i sacrificed my son my daughter
[1:07:41] sacrifico
[1:07:43] i sacrificed the youth of the church
[1:07:45] sacrifico la juventude de la glacia for
[1:07:47] god

[1:07:51] economy
