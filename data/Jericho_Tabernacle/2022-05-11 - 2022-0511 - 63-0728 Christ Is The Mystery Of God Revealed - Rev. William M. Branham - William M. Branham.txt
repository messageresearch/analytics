to teach thy word and that we might know how to live in this present day and what is the time of day that we're living we'd ask thy holy guidance to our thoughts our hearts today that you would direct us to every word that is necessary for us to know to open our mouths freely and our hearts also to receive and that which you would speak to us and would close our mouths to the things that are not right knowing that only you can reveal the word of god and now as i have to leave the little church right away now for the other parts of the world i'm committing them to the lord which they are

in bring them in from the fields of sin bring them yeah bring them in bring the little ones to cheese [Music] i like that see bring them to christ before the devil even has a chance they're already presented to him then for a life of service does anybody know whether the dao family any of them got down today or not sister down brother brown are you here brother brown yes i'm glad and the brother dao is still with us and wonderful brother dao almost left us see we can't say too much or ask too much he's already 21 years have passed the time that god told him to live that's an ordinary lifetime a past the time that god told him he could live but we had a call the other morning that he was he was dying and we rushed up there and the lord god was really good to him and spared him just i think he is ready and just waiting the coming of the lord but you know we all hold on to one another we just the old fellow is like a like a dad to me here i remember him sitting right down here in the old tabernacle the old part when he that light flashed across on that water baptism in the name of jesus christ right out of there he cometh about 87 88 years old on a stick come right up here and said i won't go right in there and be baptized somebody went got him some clothes he couldn't wait till the next time he had come right then right and so i like that instead the other day i was talking to him he said you think i'm all right now brother branham i said did you ever go to a doctor for a physical checkup he said yes sir i said the doctor put stereoscopes in his ears and put them on your heart see if your heart's beating right an electrical cartogram and then blood pressure urine tests and so forth instruments to find out where your physical being now the way he does that he looks back on a book here where specialists on these different subjects writes down if this takes place this is what's wrong and i said now the only steer scope that i have is the bible or the soul i said i'm going to give you the test i said saint john 5 24 said he that heareth my words i said that isn't just sitting listening to it that's receiving it you're seeing it you believe it something inside of you tells you it's right you've accepted it you believe it it's yours he that heareth it's already yours my words and believeth on him that sent me you believe that he said i do i said then i'll tell you what the chief doctor said he's passed from death unto life and shall no more come into condemnation or judgment i said as far as i know according to the books you pass examination that old man of nearly 100 years old not a church man at all but just the first time that light flashed across his path he received it see that predestinated seed laying there see as soon as the light strikes it it comes to life right quick now i know it's hot today and uh it looks like it's hard for me to call you people together for a service where you sit jammed in like this but yet i i thought by the grace of god that i would have another service before i had to leave you on for a short season i trust and i've got to go now tomorrow night uh to chicago to begin wednesday i thought i'd get there a little early if possible and rest up a little before beginning a series of service and i believe they got it here i was looking at it right here it's advertised up there it's called the moringal uh area yeah marigold murray yeah area arena marigold arena it's worth to be helped beginning wednesday night through sunday and the full gospel businessman has a breakfast also on on saturday morning and i don't know just exactly where they got that advertised for um no then saturday evenings at the lean tech i see here it's um every time um now if you're around in that area or up there it's be a regular if it's a regular evangelistic service like we have at any time most of the messages will be primarily on something that's been taught here called shares where we make our tapes you see out there they can fuss but if they get tapes made from here that's up to them if they want to listen to any tape it comes right from here this is our own pulpit so out there usually i'll try to pick around on something not very deep because many of them are shallow and experiencing what comes in but here i feel i have a right to say whatever god puts up on my heart to say it from right here so our tapes are all made from right here and they're right in the room there now you can see their heads up over the cloudy glass in there where they're sitting with their recorders now um if you want to come to the meeting we'd be most happy to have you just if you get there don't know just where to go or just contact any of the full gospel people or brother carlson and he'll he'll tell you that's um you can advise you the philadelphia church or any of them they can tell you right how to get to the place then i'll come back next monday evening sometime afternoon or evening and tuesday we'll go back to arizona for for but the children in school and so forth and then i don't know just exactly when to be back again because uh the lord i want him to leave me just on what to do a very strange thing happened i might as well i know this is taped i might as well place it on here and right while visions and leadings of the holy spirit is moving i like to strike just exactly while it's moving that's now in the last year it's been one uh right along with one of the most highest time for visions that i've ever had in all my ministries been this last year of things that has taken place that you people know that is foretold before it happens and it happened just the way it it said now we come back here and into the visit the climate and this place i certainly don't like because it just breaks me down as soon as i get here and i just i can cross the top of the knobs up there and come down in this valley and i'm here about 10 minutes and i got hives gets sick weather swimming headed everything looks spooky dark and i i just have to get out of it see and the other day i was talking to the wife but what brings me in first what brings me in here is you people okay this church i tell you of all the places i went my life this is my favorite place to come preach the gospel and looks like we can make a tape from here it's ten times better than anywhere else that's the reason i say where god's doing something and stay right with that but i think where the great thing is that's me failing to go out at the first time when he called me and therefore he makes it kind of rough on me when i come in obedience is better than sacrifice and then i'll be coming back and forth all the time preaching in the tabernacle and you people from out of town you'll be notified billy paul will be here right in the office and and be reached at any time through him and we'll be coming back here and then the seven trumpets is coming up right away the lord willing seven last flags and the vials and so forth just as we can get a little cooler weather maybe or something however the lord leads and now the other day coming in uh there was a question brought up about something about someone who had given me a a check and said personally exactly just to me and me only tax paid free everything else well we went and billy knew that uh connie had need of that check now he went and asked the attorneys if we could cash it he said why he's american citizen why can't he cash it see says tax paid and everything else free any citizen can do that so then he couldn't be satisfied with that billy so he goes to the public accountant he said what certainly he can cash that said he's a citizen united states so well he couldn't think good about that so he called merle miller that's the head of the the tax association at indianapolis there was our attorneys and so ice and miller so sure it's all right hey sure he can have that check it's it's uh it's made out to him and dorsey only like only one can endorse it so forth and it couldn't be stamped with rc i don't cash no checks that's what they got before the other time somebody bring in a bunch of checks and say here brother bram at the meeting i'd say william branham william branham well the government's taking care of all that the whole time and i assigned him to myself and he's paying the debts out there but they said i would delinquent taxes on all of it anyhow three hundred thousand dollars so then um that's where the fuss came so then as soon as i put this check in whammy here come the agent right back that will reopen the case for him now and so it made it kind of rough and brother lee vale sitting here i guess it's all right to say it we just he'd come down and this fine scholar baptist year had i baptized him in the name of jesus christ you're in the pool the other day brother levail and so he's really a fine man a brother in christ he's preached for us here before highly intellectually educated and besides that a spirit-led man the light flashed across him he said he tried to get away if it just couldn't do it so i baptized him right here in the morning couldn't stand it any longer so we just come down here put on her clothes when he was baptized in the name of jesus christ well i thought being you've taken that fine spiritual food maybe to talk a little bit we'd take some natural food so he goes over to blueboard sits down was talking and the subject come up how can you let people talk about you like that now brother vale one of the finest man they ever know but just a little too quick on the trigger i always told him you know and so um hey um so i said i hope that's all right brother so uh he's i said don't fly loose all at once sit still god's the ones that are doing it he said i might be all right for you he said he said but well he i believe he is so smart so that's what he's been meeting those smart intellectual people so he just knows how to pour it in there and ain't got no place to stand that's all so i said look brother vail was sitting at the blueboard i said david one day after being throwed from the throne by his own son run off the throne mutiny israel divided and david took off the throne by his own son and was going out of the city weeping and a guy that didn't like his last day message you know he didn't care for him little fella kind of crippled up going along there making fun of him and he spit on david and that's guard drew that sword said i'll let the head of that dog stay on him spit on my king david said let him alone the lord told him to do that spit on him making fun of him and then spit on him so the lord told him to do that well we know the story i return back brother vale thought that took a whole lot of grace to do that so no more coming back and entering the office uh public accountant called billy paul and told him about this so brother vale went up the house with me and i walked in i said to the wife's lawn about sometime in the afternoon we went in a room i said i got something to tell you honey we just been talking four left she said bill i know that god sent you out there we all know that but he never told you come back he said huh that's what i'm worried about i said well i think it's for you and the children don't matter for me i'm gonna serve him lord willing wherever i go and so walk back and i told her about it like that so i just turned around laid my head up and somebody said something about oh this tax collector who ought to buy just kind of raided out something like that uh not thinking of what i told brother vale i said let him alone maybe the lord told him to do that and no more and said that the light flashed on the wall and rode across there brother vale my wife sitting there come on back to arizona with letters roll across the wall come on back to arizona that's right so here i go and then back to arizona now this week has been a week of great blessings we had private interviews uh this week uh people who have been waiting since the seven seals and i don't doubt but some of them courses called in from out of the town across the nation but uh the morning before the interview started sitting in the room the holy spirit let me write out exactly everything they knew everything they wanted to ask rotate the questions just the way they wanted to and tell them their dreams and interpretation before they ever told me now that people are in the room here there and i go ahead let them talk and say well brother branham i come such and such i said now remember we have symbol here not for fellowship we haven't come here to fellowship with one another there is a question in your mind in your heart that that you stumbled into and you don't know what it is and maybe i'll be able by the help of god to do it i said remember the queen of the south had some questions too when she came to solomon and the bible said there was nothing revealed or held back to what solomon couldn't answer for and i said a greater than solomon is here that's right the lord jesus promised wherever two or three are gathered in my name there i am in the midst of them whatsoever thing they can think of or desire and and shall last it shall be given to them and now your question is something you don't know about something you don't know how to approach about something you don't know what to do about and i said again the scripture said this that the angels of god are encamped about those who fear him so in another world where the five senses does not declare the five senses only contacts this world if you had no feeling you couldn't feel nothing feeling wouldn't be nothing to you that be another world you had no sight what you look at would be another world you know nothing about it so these five senses is the only thing that god let us loose to now there is another one called faith but by faith you walk up a ladder and finally you can get so high until you break into another world which is vision there you can see just like if you never know what this was you was feeling with your sense of feeling never seen it then your eyes come open you can see it it'd be all mystery to that person who never could see it'd be a mystery to him but yet that's it and in there the lord before we got here to people from across the country everywhere from north south west come in for these interviews and as soon as they get through talking just exactly the questions they would ask the thing that they would ask about i'd say watch here raise over and there was a piece of paper with every question and rotate that's exactly the way they asked it was going to ask it their answer down here to their questions and just answer now the lord is great he knows all things but yet take me about three days to come out of that afternoon what it was such a tear down and now i thought to get it oh before we left and there is the proper way the real way of to individuals now these things can be said and if the people share that knowledge that secrets of hearts that was revealed that would absolutely it would be horrible it caused crime because somebody shoot another or something if that be revealed right here at the platform like this in a pub and before the public it would cause penitentiary offenses and everything else that would but when you're setting together like that the holy spirit just too heavy together but we understand this that what they ask me is private i say nothing about it and what i say to them it's up to them where they want to say it or not but it's be no one between us the interview that's taking the person one by time and sitting there until everything is completely settled see the holy spirit and then to think of the grace the holy spirit telling me all about it to each one a whole line of them before they ever even got here across the country coming people i've never seen in life and write it out so if they had no it's a routine according to the questions the way they would answer it one brother had questions on the serpent seed that i didn't get the answer just exactly because her little half hour was up i hope that he got it all right the answers to it on the paper i he had it rolled out and he didn't get to all of his answers so i just gave him the writing back the answers on the paper if he hasn't billy paul has it i know the man sitting here i just looked at him just a few moments ago so if he if he wants to find that it's wrote out on a piece of paper your answers to your question now oh how good the lord is i hope everybody's feeling good and now let's us remember and now when i pray for these anxious to remember brother dao he's a precious brother and we want to remember him in prayer and um i see brother angran but uh i can't see sister angering anywhere whether she's all right now yes setting right out from him sure yeah i'm glad cause was called out the other night in a just an emergency case of her and her daughter sister downey downy uh run off the road and just the grace of god or they've both been crushed to pieces right there and here they come right on the church got on a training come on i'll never forget you all i love you god knows that uh i love you how across the country through slick weather when i look at some brother here from georgia and alabama and different places in tennessee and around where they ride their car down the road where the eyes slide and back and forth like that to come here for one service when i had that emergency called her brother down the other day i didn't realize that lying ohio was so far away yes i thought that's a little skip hop and a jump but my eyelid chair real early that morning never got there to one o'clock that afternoon driving every everything the speed limit would allow and on dual highway and i think how close that is the way down in the south the way these other people come from way out in the north and west where they come i love you and that's the reason i try to be deadly sincere here and the old timers i see brother creech them sitting back there now and ones that's been with me all these years and things and how we come up together i was looking at mary jo's picture i believe it was a couple nights ago just a little bitty tiny thing when we first met now she's married i guess and got children brother cretes and sister creech uh young black-headed and media and i and here we are agree and stooped over see there's something about people like that that it grips you me you you you want to stay with them see there's something other that it always makes your mind pull back just giving them for examples to others that you're young and old we look forward for the coming of the lord so this morning i've put it god i believe put it in my heart to teach a sunday school lesson here this morning god willing for a lengthy time and uh this being my last service for a little while as far as i know the and i want you to remember that brother neville you're left in the church in the charge of this tabernacle under the holy spirit and he's left her and he believes his messages and teaches it just the same as i do all right and any time you want to you can see fit to come to hear brother neville he certainly would do you good i'm sure the great servant of jesus christ i've known armin neville since i was a little boy and he hasn't changed one spec only got closer to god i remember when i first saw him on a i was invited to his methodist platform and when i come back here at the tabernacle i said someday i'll baptize him in the name of jesus christ and uh here he is with the message now going on a real gallant servant and brother neville goes through many strains and heartaches that he doesn't show it here at the tabernacle but being that the lord lets me have a little sight into people's life i know what he goes through a whole lot of it see and he certainly goes under a lot of labor and strains and things and you people here hold him up like joshua and caleb held up the hands of moses as he's bringing the word love one another above everything love one another don't no matter what the devil tries to say now you're all one great big sweet group now but remember my warning see satan won't let that stay that way no sir he'll shoot everything if he has bring somebody in to make his target he'll bring some critical unbeliever in and set him down and cause him to fellowship with you other quietness and things they need to shoot that guy with some kind of poison stuff and he'll start through the church with it don't you take sides with it don't you have nothing to do with anything else you stay right loving and sweet and kind to one another pray for that man that he'll be saved too or that woman or neighborhood is it pray for them and stick one with another and stay with your pastor see he's the shepherd and you give him respects he'll lead you through and because he's ordained of god to do so how do you remember that the enemy will come and when he does just clean that much closer together and the one that the devil is using foreign enemy will either get out or come and be one of you that's all don't never clan among one uh or talk and make yourself clannish we are one i couldn't say left hand i'm mad at you i'm going to take you away because you're not a right hand he's my left hand i want him to stay there even the little tip of my finger i want to stay right there every little part of my body stay right there and god wants us as a body of believers to stay right exactly with one another write it with one another and now you've got tapes on that you've got tapes on what we believe you've got tapes on discipline in the church how we behave ourself in the church of god how we got to come here together set together in heavenly places don't stay home if god is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out honor to get in here to fellowship with your brothers if you don't don't feel that way then i'll tell you it's time you got to pray in because we're in the last days where the bible exalted uh resorted us to much more as we see that day approaching to love one another with christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in heavenly places and and and christ jesus and love one another this will all man know you're my disciples when you have love one for the other that's right stay right together if the brother you think he's a little wrong or the sister say lord don't let me ever have the root of bitterness spring up cause it'll it'll affect him and it'll take the christ right out of my life that poison assets of malice and jealousy and hatred that'll just take the holy spirit right away from you it'll run him from the tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of god or drive it away from here hurt your pastor it'll do everything see don't you do that you just wax that much closer together draw up the take the buckle as a brother testified and minister here tonight about having a buckle seen it in a vision just that buckles on the whole armor of god just put her on tighten up move right up close to one another love one another anyhow talk nice about one another say nice things about one another and then god will bless you now this morning the lord willing by his help and grace i got quite a bunch of questions here of scriptures rather and now before we approach it i think i heard the recorders click on in there we are going to bring the message now about god's grace first a word of prayer lord jesus speaking to this body of the church that they should hold together with god's unchanging hand their absolute the word warning them as paul warned his flock that there be wolves enter in you're the same god today as you were then and that enemy is the same may this fellowship and bonds of love always exist amongst these people in christ jesus help this morning lord as we read the word may the holy spirit reveal it to us that the church might be fully established in the faith that was once delivered to the saints to hold them and may as you gave the vision some two years ago to store up the food fine healthy looking vegetables that i saw in the vision being stored here in this tabernacle may we today receive a whole barrel full of that granite lord our tape load that it might reveal jesus christ to us in the hour that we live to give us sustaining strength and spiritual strength for the past that lays ahead granted father bless these thy children they're in here this morning from many different parts of the nation a hot sticky morning but yet we feel the presence of the holy spirit and all this we think of john wesley and calvin and cincy and knox finney and many of those even without electric fan or people set in halls and perspiration running down their faces the women well covered and dressed set in the audiences and perspired till their clothing was soaking wet listening to the word of god feeding their souls now we feel are that they're at rest some worry honor waiting the coming of the lord keep us together father let the holy spirit guide us and direct us give us long life of service for you give us this great message this morning that we're expecting out of thy word that it might go to each heart make the lips that speak lord speak truth make the heart that years be fertile to receive truth amen and may it grow into great trees of eternal life to be shining lights and red epistles of all man they might know that jesus christ has raised from the dead and lives among us make us so full of love in the fruit of the spirit until other men and women boys and girls can see the results of the life of christ still living in us after 2 000 years from the great event granted father to honor thee we asked in jesus christ's name amen now i want to read some of the scriptures and i trust now that you've got your pencils and papers and everything ready brother neville you're sitting still i'm just going to take my coat off excuse me for taking off my coat but this this is a awfully warm up here now i want you to return to the book of colossians the first chapter of clothing and then while we read this beginning with i want you when you go home to read the entire chapter of these colossians but i want you to read this morning with me from the 15th verse uh 29th inclusive and now just be as patient as you can or i feel that in this year if god will help me we'll reveal and bring into your mind all these other things that i have talked on all through the days of the tabernacle why i have said what i've said and why i have done what i have done this is why now from the 15th verse who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in the earth visible invisible were they be thrones dominions principalities powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the primitive for it please the father that in him should be all fullness dwell should all fullness dwell let me put a little emphasis on that again this 19th verse for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things and to himself by him i say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven watch where that reconciliation went and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works you now has he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy unblameable approvable in his sight if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and not be moved away from the hope of the gospel which you have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven world of i paul made a minister who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is bound behind all the affections of christ and flesh for his body sake which is the church whereof i am made a minister according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of god even the mystery which has been hidden from age and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints i want to read that verse again even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man and all wisdom that we might present every man perfect in christ jesus or unto i also labor striving according to the working which worketh in me mightily now for a text i want to take out of there this for a text basically upon the entire bible but i want to title this christ is the mystery of god revealed christ being the mystery of god reveal now i took it in order as a sunday school lesson so we could all read together and and uh have this fellowship together now god's secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back part of god's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive and doing it in order to let himself be expressed because first there wasn't even a moon star atom molecule or anything he was god but he exactly wasn't god at that time because god is an object of worship and there wasn't nothing to worship him so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed in him was love in him was to be father in him was to be son in him was to be a savior in him was to be a healer all these great attributes that we see already expressed they were in god so my opinion the first thing that he made was angels and then they worshipped him and that made him god and he started from there as in previous messages i have tried to explain it break it down and now then when angels begin to worship him that was before there was even a molecule in the earth there was nothing it was all darkness there was no sun there's no moon no stars no nothing then he was god as he asked job where was you when i laid the foundations of the world i think when the morning star sang together the sons of god shouted for joy now where were you see that's way back before the earth now god had a purpose and a hidden mystery and that's what i want to speak on to the church this morning the hidden mystery of god that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how that's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living praise the lord then you will understand clearly that you see on i believe what is being done god's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody knows nothing about even the angels didn't understand it he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh uh uh mystery when the seventh seal was opened there was silence jesus when he was on earth they won't know when he would come he said it's not even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen see god has this all to himself it's a secret that's reason there was silence in heaven for space for a half hour and seven thunders earth their voices and john was even forbidden to write it see the coming of the lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't no he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the bible therefore the entire bible is the revelation of god's mystery in christ the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible and all the acts of the uh the believers in the bible has been entitled and expressing what god's great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it and god's help you'll see it right here this morning what the lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it therefore you can see the great meaning of what it's been to know this and then try to bring it to the people see and then you don't i haven't went into details to try to explain it as god has revealed it to me now if you want to mark this down i've got so many places i want to read from and now in in the book of saint luke the 24th chapter of saint luke we find out it's it is the two of the apostles on the road to emmaus and jesus stepped out after his resurrection and they were on the road to over to emmaus going along the road thinking and talking and weeping on account of his his death and how they seen him suffer for what they thought was of no value at all they took their lord and crucified him and and they were going along that weeping and he stepped out from the roadside and began to talk to them about christ he said oh fools and slow to understand don't you know that all the prophets and the psalms see what was he doing identifying himself to these apostles that all of the prophets and all of the psalms and everything was him expressed see and now the reason i never talked to preach this morning was because i thought in teaching we would understand it better than just to take a text and skip over we just uh teach it he was saying that all the psalms and all the prophets spoke of him well therefore that shows that all of the old testament all of the new testament and all of the psalms the singing the songs that were sung were sung of him take the 22nd psalm and sing it and compare it with the mourning of the crucifixion see my god my god why has i forsaken me all my bones they stare at me they pierce my feet and my hands yet all those things there them singing that psalm down there in the temple and crucifying the very onesie see those great religious leaders those great man those great teachers and yet so blinded that was reading the prophets and was singing the songs and doing the crime that they said they would do the same thing is taking place this morning now listen close cause i ain't going to even pay attention to what that clock says i want you to get this thing so you can see here basically in the beginning the very thought that god had in his mind he hid it from all of those scholars and the just a number a selected predestinated number a predestinated people was the only ones that heard it i now search back the scripture down through the age of the prophets and see if it wasn't the same thing now and jesus here referring them to the prophets and the psalms he said they all spoke of him see and here these jewish teachers rabbis doctors of the law professors have did exactly like they had done before now notice again he said search the scriptures for they are they that testify me search the scriptures the scriptures the entire scriptures what am i trying to do to show you that this bible is the thing that's right the other day standing in a hospital room talking a sister had asked me to explain about denominations why we was against denominations uh with some denominational people you see it's got to come back to the word because the word is god and jesus declaring the same here that the word is him you can't make the scripture contradict itself in the beginning was the word awards with god and the word was god and the word made flesh amen now here he says search the scriptures they testify me in them you think you have eternal life and that's true and they are the ones that bear record of me and i'm bearing record of them and if i do not the works has promised that i would do then don't hear me but if i do the works and you can't believe me believe the works because they testify that he is the word oh it looks like it couldn't be any plainer thing all right now search the scriptures he said moses and all the laws and so forth and the prophets and psalms spoke of him and again he said the scriptures testify of him he is the principal theme of the entire bible if you read the bible and don't see christ and every verse of it go back and read it again if you can't see christ in every verse of the bible then you read it again because you missed something the bible is christ he is the word when you read in the beginning god created there's christ see every from that to the amen in revelations is every word testifying of jesus christ that's why these added books that are called the second book of daniel in uh the book of the maccabees uh adds purgatory and stuff like that see it's not spoken of in the scripture see it doesn't theme up with the rest of it there's no place to place purgatory in there there's no place to place intersection of saints and things there's no place in there for that there's no place for a denomination there's no place for for creeds outside of the of the bible so when you see those things they just don't come into the picture and that's why people has added those and got their their their jigsaw puzzle all mixed up man they can't make it right same yesterday and forever but if the things put together right there's the entire picture of the fall and regeneration the whole picture of creation god's whole plan revealed right in jesus christ amen that's the whole picture set together every little crooked corner it's just like no i don't mean to be sacrilegious by this but it's just like putting a jigsaw puzzle together that's why we got pictures today it looks horrible say we are believers the cow picking grass up on top of the tree don't work that's when they say yeah he's ever way but just of a certain he's saying yesterday and forever all but a certain thing see then you ruin your picture the bible said he is the same amen saint john 5 or saint john 14 12 he said he he anybody he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also well that was for another age there you got your picture wrong again you got a man fishing out in the desert for fish and a bunch of hot sand well there's no fish i had see see you've got to bring him back to where he's fishing at galilee where there's plenty of fish you see you you got to make the picture look right it's god's great picture and there's only one way you'll see it that when you see jesus christ there's the entire bible he's the principal theme of the bible now you realize that any of these places here you could take a text it's just hard for a preacher to hold his peace you look like you want to keep going with it but you've got to get back to what we're teaching on he is the principal theme of the bible he was in the prophets he was in the psalms he was in the history of the bible the bible is a prophetic book it's a historical book it's a book of love it's a book of songs it's a book of life and in there you find christ he was in the prophets he was in the psalms he was in the history and he also in the bible is the things that is to come so he was before and after what does that make him the same yesterday today and forever and you inject something in there that doesn't make him the same yesterday and forever brother lee where do you go to you got an awful picture there for he was the history see and he is the prophet he is the psalms he is everything and if you can't make him everything and the same what's your picture look like do you see it all right he is the thing he was the prophets he was in them he was in the psalms he was in the history and he is the things to come the same yesterday and forever hebrews 13 8 if you're writing it down he should be then he should be the principal if that's what he is and we believe it don't we yes amen then if he is that then he should be the principal theme of our talking of our thinking of our singing of our walks he should be the principal theme of our life if he's the principal theme of the bible and the bible is in us then he should be the principle theme of everything that we do say our thing amen should be christ amen is that right all right since we think this since he's been made the head of all things to us the colossians said so here he's the head of all things to us for he was made for us which we are considered all things he said what about the sinner he was made to be the judge of the sinner if he don't accept it he was made the glory for the believer who does accept it so their thing all things was made by him and for him and it takes the night to express the glory of the day it takes the vessel of dishonor to express the the love and care for the vessel of the honor it takes an evil woman that would wear immoral clothes and and seller morals to express the virtue of a decent genuine lady it takes a crook and a thief in a man to express the genuineness of a real believer a real christian it takes the hypocrite to show up the believer what he is so all things was made by him and since he was made all thing made for all of us all things was made far by him then since that is true we should make our identification should be with him we should be identified ourselves with him because he has identified himself with us we should be identified with him how by living for him amen not just a confession so many people take a confession say i say it's got to this place now are you a christian i'm methodist oh that's a long ways from being making yourself known as a christian oh look what the methodist does i'm baptist look what the baptist does i'm catholic look what they do see but the only way that you can actually be a christian is for christ to identify himself in you now we got some a stinger there i hope everybody on the tape gets that too see you say i'm pentecostal that don't mean a thing it's christ identified in you that's when he has recognized you so i spoke of tongues devils does too i shouted the mohammedans buddhas and everything shouts the indians scream at the snake dance hey there are they all do cults clans and everything else scream and holly holler and shallow the baseball game but when christ is identified in you identifying himself saying you are christ-like which the word christian means to be christ-like there's your identification all right now and since he is our identification then we should be identified with him by living for him notice god has had a threefold purpose in this great mystery secret god in his great mystery secret that he had before the world began he's got a threefold purpose in it and now what we want to go up on this morning is what is that threefold purpose i believe by the help of the of god who's present and he'll show it to us amen um now if he had this threefold purpose we want to find out what is this threefold purpose the first thing was that god wanted to reveal himself to the people he couldn't do it as a great jehovah god who covered all space time and eternity he could not is too great to ever be revealed to people because it would be too mysterious how could that great being that never did began that after you went beyond the cycle of hundreds of billions and trillions and trillions of years of life space and all out into the infinite into the eternity and a great creature that was all that and
