thoughts as you already know by now yeah amen i want to show a little picture of him before we start today yes man man he was uh his name is lucas daniel so nombre es lucas daniel a man a good good

we thank you for your prayers and we just ask you to keep praying for us my prayer is that he doesn't become a preacher i can care less if he becomes a preacher i just wanted to be a laborer in god's word i just wish he could be a humble laborer to serve god's people amen amen um thank you once again brothers gracias hermanos are you ready to hear god's word established amen uh if you can go to our scriptures to hebrews 13 verse 4. i think by by this by the by these heights i guess i can just have a young person come up yeah and without with without the scripture he probably has a scripture already memorized amen amen marriage is honorable in all and the bad undefiled but whoremongers and adulterers god will judge amen let's let's borrow heads and let's approach the author of the word dear lord heavenly father father celestial lord we come before your your throne lord we just give you thanks lord for all the blessings you've given us lord my prayer is that that there can be a young person today or a young person that's listening lord may he take the word of god lord may he stand for the word of god i place all the young people in your hands and all the ones who are married christ amen amen amen uh you may take your seats we like to thank our pastor for allowing us to bring forth this series this is a message number five estes el menzake numero cinco hopefully lord willing on this sunday dio mediante puedemos este domingo uh hopefully we can wrap it all up and um and i i hope that there's a lot of questions surging in the young people that that if you have questions go to the ministers because ministers go to the pastures go to the elders and and yeah we have all the advice in the world we thank god that we have young ministers ministers we have ministers that have gone through this ministers ministers have gone through that and we have plenty of elders that they've gone through so much we should take advantage of all of that information let us not go to the wrong source fuente let us not go to the internet let us not go to our buddies amigos let's go right here at home vamos aqui en casa you have your parents and amen amen aren't you thankful that we have a church that's filled of of of food iglesias we don't have just one elder no solomon we have many of them and let's let's take advantage of that amen and this evening we like to speak on the sacred vowel last time we were here we spoke on the on confession and once that person reaches that stage of confession and they talk amongst themselves that they're telling you something and confidence is something that perhaps a lot of people don't know and they're trusting you to know this information and let's say that nothing works out between them usually i know we belong in the christian message church church are christians so let's just say they don't work out and the young man runs off and tells the whole church this young sister did this and she did that and she tells her and he tells her mom and the mom tells that sister says you know what that young girl did and she went with that old man she did this that young man should not be doing that a man amen and if he tells his mom that mom should be a christian christian and should tell that son son things didn't work out what she told you pero lo que ya espresso was with trust don't tell anyone man amen vice versa with the young lady vice versa don't start to tell what the young man did this why because the temptation is going to come then the people the church says why aren't you guys together anymore why aren't you guys together juntos well because he did that no nope and he was with this and we're doing that because he confessed to me now the best thing that you should say he said that god just god showed us that we shouldn't be together i hope that the day of tomorrow that doesn't happen the only one that if you will confess is to the wife that you do end up being with confess so once once you once you reach that stage and and it's really beautiful that everything is coming out great yes we come where a lot of people they love this stage i have the definition there of engagement it says it's a formal agreement to get married amen so what should you do what should i the the couple should be doing before getting to this stage of course they should be praying earnestly uh claro de monstar orlando talking to his pastor to see if this is the right time to do this the young man should already be born again and with maturity you should be confident that that she is the wife that god has predestinated and financially what should we do what should that couple do when they're in that stage you know that's a very delicate stage right there you know it's it's something that you guys should be very careful there's a way how you should do things to to start that stage the young man shouldn't go and just give her a ring and pop up to her parents house and say hey we're getting engaged we're getting married you shouldn't just give them the ring and said and just show up together in the house says look you're my suegro now you know we had a form of friendship me and my wife for about a year and then we dated for four years and we dated there for that long we dated through all through her colleagues i mean i started i mean i like i told you last week i didn't even know how to the last time i ate at a restaurant you know i saved up so much money four years of saving money cuatro another and i saw that i was financially ready to take on the responsibilities you know what he told me you think he told me well you're a minister go right up there you're fine let's go talk to the dad no he said did you talk to her first yes does she want to get engaged with you have you proposed yet yeah yeah i said no i haven't proposed but we have talked about it so when a young man is feeling ready to go propose to the young lady if you ever want to feel nervous in your life don't go to six flags no no six flags don't go to the biggest ride in disneyland in disneyland man amen go right to your go go to the parent's house but i feel good because i had brother johnny with me the will send sat there in a dining table but brother johnny already called my wife's father caesar we're going to do this and this and this date and we want to have a meeting with you we went there to the house and we sat on the table but johnny sat right next to me marginalized that's why i said you might not like him he's going to be your best friend amen amen he's going to back you up if you like a daughter her and her dad is a little bit of a tough guy and his dad doesn't want to let the daughter go the pastor's going to come el pastor brother johnny got there manoj started talking in this but here he ain't even talking and he's trembling so then i asked permission and that's where we we we rearranged the blessing for us to get engaged i hope you're taking these nuggets and and you apply it so please don't don't don't take the young lady don't go to las vegas and get married do things right so they can see they can base themselves not an example of a minister or because the pastor did it no they did it because mom and dad didn't know hey that's the best sermon you can give your son porcelain so there is that's that's your goal it is is it for us to have uh to start off right and i'm just going to insert this you know i'm going to backtrack a little bit a good interesting question how long should this stage last not more than a year no mas du nano not more than a year no mas du nano and brother bernie would would uh have the engaged couples if it was more than a year it was for certain reasons but it was no more than a year that's why that's why you should already be getting financially ready way beforehand foreign don't start getting financially ready once you get the ring to her no preparation start getting ready way before that why because then the temptations begin to come then the devil starts to creep in diablo you're technically it's not technically yeah amen amen oh i think there should be someone man amen man i hope you still love me they're in that stage when the young amen let's go to our scriptures in genesis 24. everything that we're saying basing them off to the scriptures we're basing we want to base it off the scriptures genesis 24 29. and this is we're going to take off here when we i think we spoke on the third message we're here with uh isaac and rebecca konisaki rebecca when eliezer was finding the wife for isaac where we left off is where where eliezers saw the servant saw that that the rebecca did what he prayed for and god has prop prospered his way so here that's what we're going to take off where we left off yeah and rebecca had a brother and his name was laban and laban ran out to the man ran on to the man onto the well rebecca it came to pass when he saw the earring and the bracelets upon his sister's hands and when he had heard the words of rebecca his sister saying thus spake the man unto me that he came unto the man and behold he stood by the camels by the well if putting down in my notes the earrings and the bracelets now i'm that's just my thought to you our smith he said come in thou thou blessed of the lord wherefore stands thou without for i have prepared the house and the room and room for the camels and the man came into the house and he ungerted his camels and gave straw and provender for the camels and water to wash his feet and the men's feet that were with him and there was set meat before him to eat but he said i will not eat until i have told my aaron and he said speak on it so there are my notes i put that he's going to start confessing that's what we said earlier in the past messages there's going to you can say that that's why we're entitled at the sacred vowel that's we're going to find out what happens if you don't and what happens if you tell her everything and you don't even end up with her vamos a uh said i'm not going to eat yet until i tell you why and we're telling up because abraham was a renowned name by that time he knew who abraham was yes that god blessed abraham he said i am abraham's servant so whenever you go to that young lady's family you might not come from a family of renowned names the lord had blessed my master greatly and he has become great and he has given him flocks and herds and silver and gold and men servants and maidservants and camels and asses how prepared he is financially he's telling all the natural all the physical natural things they have hey man i think that's where there's no excuse for a young man my mother she worked as a janitor in the school my mother and what i did i remember one summer that there was a teacher in the school that she worked at establishment she needed help to move her things from a classroom to another classroom my mom said well i have my son he's about 12 years old he can help you my mother didn't i didn't do it to get paid i just did it my mom told me to do it so i want to stay home my mom she's the type of person that she kind of thinks or she speaks what she thinks and and she always took us to church an hour early before church even started then we live about 10 minutes away from the church i was a young kid that you can imagine me i didn't want to be there she started getting her check and she started talking empathy heart because we would never go out to eat nunca we always eat at home simply and she said i'm going to take 30 out of the thais when i get paid again next week but i'm going to add the 30 that i took out this week when i saw that no one had to tell me navier this very day has ever told me that when i got my first check now you might believe me you might not know obligated to tell you the truth and i gave my mom all my checks my mom was a janitor i had a brother i have a brother and i have a sister my dad was an alcoholic my father an alcoholic now he's an uh he's the usher he's an usher of the church by god's grace we don't have any money no we didn't have money to get close to school we don't have money to go out to eat young man you see your mom you see that she irons and she cooks i gave her all of my checks if you want to know how to prosper in your life and you're never going to go hungry is that a promise for me no that's the promise of god this is promesa come straight from god and god is my witness all right i never had to struggle a young man a young sister so we're going to skip 36-46 is there the servant is telling the family all the things that happen when abraham told him what to do that he needed to swear and to promise so we're going to take off from verse 47. and he says and i asked her and said whose daughter art thou and she said the daughter of bethuel and a son who milked a bear onto him and i put the earring upon her face and the braces upon her hands and says i bowed down my head and worshiped the lord and blessed the lord god of my master abraham which he had led me the right way to my master's brother's daughters onto his son the first thing i did was i prayed and the first and the next thing i saw i saw rebecca come out and rebecca gave me the drink and she drank all my and she fed all my camels what do you now if you would deal kindly and truly with my master tell me and if not tell me that i may turn to the right hand or to the left then laban and bethu answered and said the thing proceedeth from the lord we cannot speak unto the good bad or good entonces cause truly this comes from the lord amen don't don't you expect that don't you want to get to that position and it comes from the lord where it doesn't come from man that god has given you the wife god has given you the husband it says this thing proceeded from the lord and verse 51 behold rebecca is before thee taker and go and let her be let her be by thy master son's wife as the lord has spoken and it came to pass when abraham's servant heard the words he worshipped the lord bowing himself to the earth now let's jump to verse 55. and her brother and her mother said let the damsel abide with us a few days at least at least ten after that she shall go entonces and he said unto him hinder me not seeing that the lord has prospered my way send me away that i might go to my master. that's why again we talk about the engagement that stays shouldn't last too long and i know for parents that might hurt a little bit it might sting a little bit i'll get engaged for two three years one more not more than one year verse 57 and they said we will call the damsel and inquire her at her mouth here's a very important verse it doesn't matter how many signs you have that you prayed for the young lady and thunder came down and then she came in walking like that and you saw the miracle from god and you talk to the to the father talk to the pastor the dad might say yes but what does she say man amen that's the important thing that's what she says let's bring the damsel and let's see what she says they called rebecca and they said ontario will thou go with this man iran and she said i will go amen so let's let's go here we'll see what brother branham says a very well-known quote that a lot of young men know the ram says a young man asked me the other day do you think i you think i could or ought to get married brother branham and such a girl how much do you think of her cuanto las timas he said oma well if you're not going to l if you're not going to live without her you better marry her then but if you can live without her you better not perosis but if it's going to kill you you better go ahead and get married i guess that's what happens a lot when the young person comes to the pastor's office the young man never listens to the tapes of brother branham a lot of people take that quote and they run with it no let's finish all of our food let's finish our plate brother ram says he said amanda branham and i said what i was trying to get to him if you love her so much because now right now in this moment before [Music] and trials of life come in los angeles de la vida brother branham says amanda bryant if you can't live without her see no poison yeah marry her well the brand didn't even finish talking before you jump it says right now before you get married everything is wait a couple of months and he says it is that's when you got to be so in love yes you understand one another and you're just doing you got to brother branham what is the meaning of annulment elemental moment are people free to marry or this is just another word of the another word for divorce i would like some information on this if a boy promises the girl to marry her under good faith he's obligated to that girl my brother we're not in the altar is i'd rather him say it he's just as good as married her asico the only thing the law does is give him a bill of rights to live together to keep from being a common law husband and wife but when a man tells a woman i will marry you me i'll take you for my wife he's married your vow is that's that's what marries you anyhow there's no preacher that can marry you no no magistrate or anything else it's your own vow to god to this man you're married i'm going to say that again when you promise you are married let's not take this quote out of context there's a lot of times we can take the word out of context where everything is going to come to manifestations you are together no but it has to come to a time where it has to be finished it's the same thing here is let's just say i have a bunch of wood i have nails two by fours hammers i can say that's my house potentially that's why we should be very careful what we say and if you do tell a bunch of young ladies now marriage in one sense is a type the earthly marriage here is a type of the heavenly marriage celestial that's why i said that you might be married who are sitting here but how is your relationship with christ and it says let's rehearse at a moment the first thing there is there must be a decision made the first thing is in a natural marriage whether he wants the young woman there has to be a decision made and you have to make it you say she must be the only woman in the world that you love and he must there has to be so much love because that's the to let you down and then what's going to happen there it is and he must be the only man oh that young guy in high school that i used to think about oh it's high school oh this guy i thought i used to think of mexico oh este hope in the mexico only one man oh but that guy from work i remember that years ago and i should have married him and you're making the wrong decisions and that's the same way it is by making the decision for christ the first thing you have to do is make up your mind that's the first thing you got to do you're going to fall you're going to deal with this young man you're going to go with this young lady you got to make an engagement before this union can be us and that's the same way with christ the way with christ's church it has to be engagement with christ a pledge an engagement a love affair and then the next thing is promises to be a promise be made to one another the promise like that you make promise sweetheart if you marry me i promise that i'll be loyal and true prometo certainly it'll do it'll do all the duty as i'll do all the duty as a mother i'll be a housekeeper all these promises has got up and he said that this woman had a barely a husband that just got converted and he says he says i know you just got converted to christ and i know there's a lot of temptation out there in the world but if you fall pero and if you make a mistake don't you run away no say okay oh what a trust that if someone gives you that and how would you ever betray that trust someone would forgive you even if they told you if you if you make a mistake don't run away no oh we'll fix it right here you know what we say today if you go with another man if you go with another girl don't even come back home a man or a man a man or a man coc yes sir yes but this love this love that this lady had but why would i ever do something like that to him why would i do that to her it's impossible it's impossible for the ram says and that's the same thing when you come to christ he says lord if you receive receive me into your kingdom i promise senor receives there you are i love you i'll be true to you i'll serve you yo day and night too bad we forget that when we fall in love with christ serve you day and night that is and not from your heart you mean it definitely you're absolutely not living correctly with him it's it's a it's a kind of a crystallized affair look here if you have if you haven't got teeth and you have false teeth now that's all right it's substituting for the teeth that you once had but actually those teeth are not connected with you it's not a part of you if you had an arm amputated and you put a false arm on you well that arm is not actually connected see it's not connected with you and we take our pledge to christ we don't become a part of him like a woman ought to become part of a man and a man part of the woman and him 60 or 70 years old and you don't love him as good as you did in the beginning and you just really are raising his children that's the way the churches are too many today we're just taking the name of the christian church pretending to be the bride pretending when it's artificially condensed artificial we're not connected with christ in any way we're just putting it on somos well you can't put on christianity decision why want you to give applause to the lord jesus christ this evening amen come forward i hope you love the lord and i hope that if the ones who are married you're actually married with christ you're here because you love him you're married to your wife because you love her because i'm not brother i'm not with her because i'm scared to get divorced because i'm scared brother i'm not there with christ because i'm scared not because that's what we need to come to christ a young man he needs to come to christ and have the love of christ because i don't believe if a young man says if he doesn't know christ if he's not born-again and you did with but there has to be so much love [Music] when you get [Music] that you understand here none of them saw the promises none of them saw the promise abraham didn't see the problem because he was promised a child not just a child but children as my [Music] [Music] father help us to take this seriously [Music] the name of jesus christ amen [Music] and [Music] is [Music] i am [Music] the arms so let the storms reach [Music]
