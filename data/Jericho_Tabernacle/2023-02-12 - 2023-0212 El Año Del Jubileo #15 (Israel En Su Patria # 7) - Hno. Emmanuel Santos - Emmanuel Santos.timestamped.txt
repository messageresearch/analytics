[34:48] just as we're standing we can bow our
[34:50] heads
[34:51] let us pray
[34:53] ER Celestial our good Heavenly Father
[34:57] we come before thy Throne Lord
[35:01] just as the Bible says Lord
[35:04] with confidence
[35:08] for we know with this body we have fear
[35:11] and trembling
[35:12] but our soul has trust
[35:16] just like a wife has a trust in her
[35:19] husband
[35:22] just like Esther had trusted approached
[35:25] the king
[35:27] though she was not first called
[35:31] she knew the king would not kill her
[35:35] for he loved her
[35:39] now with that same trust we approach you
[35:42] Lord
[35:45] with our tests
[35:48] with everything we're going through
[35:51] we ask of thy Grace foreign amen
[36:30] just as we're standing I'd like to read
[36:33] one scripture just to begin
[36:36] in Revelation 2 17.
[36:40] you can all say Amen when you have it
[36:47] the word of God says
[37:01] receiving
[37:06] Revelation 2 17 he that hath the near
[37:09] led him here with the spirit saith to
[37:11] the churches to him that overcometh will
[37:13] I give to e of the Hidden Manna and will
[37:16] give him a white stone and in the stone
[37:18] a new name written which no man knoweth
[37:21] saving he that receiveth it
[37:25] may the Lord bless the reading of his
[37:27] word you may be seated
[37:36] I just wanted to give a small missionary
[37:38] report
[37:40] this last weekend
[37:46] his wife and his granddaughter and his
[37:49] son
[37:53] and myself
[37:56] Sonora Mexico
[38:00] we went to some meetings
[38:05] I believe the pastor's name is Luis
[38:07] Ernesto Marquez
[38:09] [Music]
[38:11] and his dick and his brother Ramon
[38:13] Cordova
[38:16] if you remember brother he was with us
[38:18] in the month of December
[38:22] he got to minister on a Friday
[38:28] and in these last months I've traveled a
[38:30] lot to Mexico
[38:33] one of the brothers I've gotten to get
[38:35] to know his brother
[38:40] so then Friday after work we went
[38:42] straight over there
[38:44] we got there in the evening
[38:49] we went there to Saturday morning
[38:51] service he uh
[38:54] before going to the meetings
[39:02] if they give us the opportunity Manuel
[39:05] to speak yeah get ready
[39:08] I was going with the trust
[39:11] confidence knowing that since they don't
[39:13] know me
[39:15] surely they won't put me to speak
[39:18] but Brothers
[39:22] there's other brothers that already know
[39:24] me
[39:25] but when he told me this is
[39:30] Emmanuel get ready because they might
[39:31] ask you to speak
[39:33] I told the brother
[39:36] they don't know me
[39:44] they're going to know you
[39:48] see foreign
[40:48] according to the Bible
[40:50] so for you that searches for an answer
[40:54] you've already got an answer but you're
[40:58] not ready
[40:59] yes
[41:01] that's something that's happened to me
[41:03] in the past years
[41:05] I already had my answer
[41:07] but since I wasn't ready
[41:10] I couldn't recognize that I had the
[41:12] answer
[41:13] is
[41:15] that's why one of the fruits of the
[41:17] spirit is patience
[41:24] now take that for your answer for today
[41:31] Saturday evening we didn't have
[41:33] Fellowship he uh
[41:37] then Sunday morning
[41:41] there was an American brother there
[41:45] I believe from Prescott Arizona
[41:47] Eric Anderson his name is brother Eric
[41:50] Anderson
[41:52] and he asked if I could help him
[41:54] interpret this is so I interpreted for
[41:57] him that morning
[42:00] and immediately after service
[42:04] we have to come back here
[42:08] we didn't even have time to eat what we
[42:11] did is
[42:17] chips and all types of things to eat
[42:20] yeah I see yes
[42:24] I got to meet many brothers over there
[42:26] yeah
[42:29] they send their greetings to our pastor
[42:31] brothers
[42:32] and unto you all the congregations
[42:37] so you received greetings in all
[42:40] different parts of Mexico
[42:43] so now let's enter into the theme for
[42:46] this morning
[42:50] this morning I want to speak about the
[42:52] hidden manner
[42:57] if we go to our Bibles in Hebrews 9
[43:00] verse 2.
[43:02] Aki Pablo here
[43:05] Paulo
[43:06] now we know Paul was a messenger
[43:10] of the of the Grace Covenant
[43:14] now here Paul under the inspiration of
[43:17] Grace
[43:18] he's speaking about the furniture okay
[43:23] that was in the natural Temple
[43:26] verse 2 he says
[43:38] for there was a tabernacle made the
[43:41] first wherein was the Candlestick and
[43:43] the table and the showbread which is
[43:46] called the sanctuary
[43:52] and after the second whale the
[43:55] Tabernacle which is called the holiest
[43:56] of all
[43:59] is
[44:12] the golden censor and the Ark of the
[44:14] Covenant overlaid roundabout with gold
[44:16] wherein was the golden pot that had
[44:19] Manna and Aaron's Rod that budded and
[44:21] the tables of the Covenant
[44:25] I believe we all know that bread
[44:27] representative
[44:30] represents the body of the Lord
[44:33] bread represents
[44:36] classes now there's different types of
[44:39] bread that they were available
[44:43] under Moses
[44:45] there was regular foreign
[45:00] that was
[45:03] in the Holy place
[45:08] then there was the hidden manner
[45:12] that's the most special bread there is
[45:16] not everyone could eat that bread
[45:21] the manner that was for the congregation
[45:24] it just it was served a purpose for that
[45:26] day only
[45:28] then the following day it had worms
[45:31] the showbread
[45:33] only the priests they could eat the
[45:37] bread
[45:39] but then after every Sabbath foreign
[45:54] of the Eternal Light Of God
[46:11] because in the outer courts
[46:14] in
[46:15] the camp of Israel
[46:19] regular yes
[46:38] and then in the holiest of holies
[46:47] that would shine upon that bread
[46:50] so it depends upon what is your life and
[46:54] what is your bread
[46:57] brother says in the burger me in age
[47:08] let's give the interpretation the best
[47:10] we can okay
[47:12] what is
[47:19] a manner that was kept in the place
[47:23] or a showbread
[47:29] that was only for the priest
[47:46] that was like the showbread
[47:50] because the showbread
[47:53] it was a special bread
[47:55] only for the priests
[48:02] it's a Believer that's been born again
[48:06] that's the True Believer
[49:12] he's talking about how that was a
[49:14] special bread
[49:16] not everyone can eat of that bread
[49:19] he continues
[49:24] you see that they had a bread for the
[49:26] congregation
[49:30] but there was a special bread for the
[49:33] priest is that so is
[49:35] this is a special bread um
[49:39] a special bread hidden manner kiss what
[49:42] is it
[49:43] who is our Mana Christo Christ
[49:48] Saint John the sixth chapter
[49:52] 48th to the 50th verse
[50:00] Jesus said that he was the bread of life
[50:03] that come down from God
[50:13] the manner that isn't given unto all the
[50:16] congregations
[50:20] the Revelation is poured out upon the
[50:23] angel of the church
[50:24] the revelation of the words
[50:29] see the revelation of the word is given
[50:32] to the angel of that age
[50:38] and revealed back the hidden manner is
[50:42] addressed to the angel of the church
[50:49] it's a little bigger revelation of what
[50:52] Christ is
[50:55] maybe a little higher call
[51:37] that is the leaders
[51:40] and this man overcame
[51:43] the whole congregation got manner
[51:48] but he got a spec but he got a hidden
[51:51] special manner
[51:53] or a special revelation
[51:57] oh of who Jesus was
[52:01] Jesus because bread represents the body
[52:03] of Jesus
[52:06] and what about him
[52:09] all about him
[52:14] see he had got the Revelation if he had
[52:17] overcome
[52:20] to hold it for if he had overcome
[52:24] addressed to the angel of the church
[52:26] now one more quote
[52:30] the exposition of the seven Church ages
[52:32] the pergamian church age
[52:34] paragraph 241
[52:38] says his word was bread
[52:41] it was the perfect man
[52:44] what's if what if a man lived by
[52:48] he shall never die
[52:52] but right after the death of the fathers
[52:57] no one seemed to know exactly the truth
[53:00] the exact truth
[53:05] in a short while this manner seemed to
[53:07] have become hidden to the people
[53:11] but in every age God began to give back
[53:15] Revelation
[53:17] that which was hidden
[53:20] until in this last days
[53:24] according to Revelation 10 7 um
[53:28] the prophet will come and reveal all the
[53:31] Mysteries
[53:33] and then the Lord will come
[53:38] now in each age I say the messages
[53:40] received hidden truth
[53:43] but they did not receive it for
[53:45] themselves only
[53:49] but it is as if when it was when the
[53:51] disciples were asked
[53:54] to serve the multitudes Loaves and
[53:57] Fishes
[54:00] Jesus gave them the broken bread
[54:04] but they in turn gave it to the people
[54:09] God gives his hidden manner to the
[54:11] Overcomers
[54:12] we cannot be otherwise
[54:19] he would not open his treasures to those
[54:21] who would spurn what is already received
[54:25] what I've been saying about the
[54:27] messenger of each age
[54:30] receiving of God some of the originals
[54:35] that's the original truth of Pentecost
[54:39] which is typed in the Old Testament
[54:43] Moses
[54:46] commanded to take up the golden vessel
[54:49] the Mana the prince of Mana in Colorado
[54:54] and place it in a golden vessel behind
[54:56] the veil
[55:06] with sacrificial blood foreign
[55:57] and they whose ears had been opened by
[55:59] the spirit
[56:00] would hear the truth believe it and live
[56:04] it
[56:05] is
[56:09] now we know bread represents the body of
[56:12] the Lord
[56:14] in First Corinthians 10 16 17. this is
[56:21] the cup of blessings which we bless
[56:24] is not the communion of the blood of
[56:26] Christ
[56:29] the bread which we break is it not the
[56:32] communion of the body of Christ
[56:35] for being as many as one bread
[56:39] and one body for we are all partakers of
[56:42] that one bread
[56:45] for we all partake of that same one
[56:48] bread
[56:49] Pablo so when the age of Paul began
[56:53] it was Mana for them
[56:56] it was a bread for them
[56:59] it was a certain part of the body for
[57:01] them
[57:02] a new age
[57:06] a new bread would enter it
[57:08] new Believers entered in
[57:15] they're in the Holy place
[57:18] it was changed every Sabbath
[57:22] so there was a certain time for the
[57:24] bread to be changed
[57:26] just like there's a certain period of
[57:28] time
[57:29] for every church
[57:31] and there was bread for that age there
[57:34] was light ipan and bread
[57:36] and Believers for that age the new age
[57:40] would come never lose
[57:43] new believers
[57:48] and bread represents the body of the
[57:51] Lord
[57:52] and it was changed every Sabbath
[57:56] brother Brandon says that that word
[57:58] Sabbath is it's rest
[58:03] and it also represents a church age
[58:07] so then in the Old Testament
[58:10] when they change up the bread every
[58:12] Sabbath
[58:15] it talks about how a new age would enter
[58:17] in Spanish and the new bread would enter
[58:20] it
[58:21] new Believers would enter in
[58:25] and the Believers of the previous Age
[58:29] The Believers that bread
[58:33] of the previous Sabbath
[58:36] they'd enter into them
[58:39] they'd enter into the rest
[58:41] they didn't turn into the Earth
[58:44] and their souls unto the sixth
[58:46] Dimensions
[58:47] they're in their Sabbath in the rest
[58:52] in the Holy Place
[58:56] awaiting that day of Resurrection
[58:59] when they've got now the perfect manner
[59:02] a perfect body
[59:05] to live here on this Earth
[59:09] bread represents the body of the Lord
[59:12] those bodies that we have
[59:14] Spanish they're also typed there with
[59:16] the bread remember
[59:21] praise the Lord then your ID for
[59:23] instance classes there's different types
[59:25] of bodies
[59:26] this human body
[59:29] is
[59:35] the bread the normal manner after a day
[59:39] it would get corrupted yes and this body
[59:43] gets corrupted the theophanese
[59:57] it's called holy bread
[1:00:01] just like the theophanes are a holy body
[1:00:10] the Bible says in first Chronicles 9 32.
[1:00:16] it talks about the children of juab and
[1:00:19] his brothers
[1:00:22] they had uh the showbreads and the uh
[1:00:25] for the propitiation
[1:00:30] they have the sober to prepare for every
[1:00:33] Sabbath
[1:00:35] is at the Feast of the trumpets
[1:00:42] and seven sabbaths is the seven Church
[1:00:45] years the seven Church years Church ages
[1:00:49] now then when every Sabbath
[1:00:52] represents an age
[1:00:54] so then every age it had its bread it
[1:00:58] has its life
[1:01:00] it had the body of Christ it had its
[1:01:03] Believers
[1:01:06] the age ended
[1:01:09] a new Sabbath introduce a new
[1:01:13] life
[1:01:15] and those of the previous age
[1:01:18] they'd enter into their Sabbath
[1:01:22] the Sabbath is the rest for the souls
[1:01:26] so
[1:01:30] now in the Holy place
[1:01:33] in the Old Testament
[1:01:36] there were three Furnitures
[1:01:40] we're talking about the table
[1:01:43] about the showbread
[1:01:45] the golden Candlestick
[1:01:48] there was another one
[1:01:52] it was called the altar of the golden
[1:01:55] altar of incense
[1:01:57] or it's also called the sensor is
[1:02:02] that was under the Old Testament
[1:02:05] but now going back to the Bible
[1:02:08] so the scripture that we read in the
[1:02:10] beginning
[1:02:12] when Paul speaks about that furniture
[1:02:17] he places the altar of incense
[1:02:20] not in the Holy place but in the holiest
[1:02:24] of holy
[1:02:41] that are under the altar
[1:02:45] is
[1:02:46] now that altar is in the Holy place
[1:02:50] now like we've already spoken on
[1:02:53] the the showbread representative that
[1:02:58] represents the body of the Lord
[1:03:02] represents the light of the messengers
[1:03:07] how many remember when brother Brandon
[1:03:09] went to the sixth Dimensions when he was
[1:03:12] there
[1:03:13] was a voice that spoke to him in
[1:03:16] the message the rejected
[1:03:20] paragraph 152.
[1:03:27] and then that voice that was speaking
[1:03:29] from above me
[1:03:33] I said you know it's written in the
[1:03:35] Bible
[1:03:38] that the prophets were gathered with
[1:03:40] their people
[1:03:42] and I said yes I remember that in the
[1:03:45] scriptures
[1:03:49] he said well this is when you will
[1:03:52] gather with your people
[1:03:55] and I said then they'll be real
[1:03:58] and I can feel them oh see oh yes
[1:04:03] I said but there are millions
[1:04:06] there's not that many branhams
[1:04:09] that voice said they're not branhams
[1:04:14] them is your Converse
[1:04:21] of the golden candles
[1:04:23] in the Holy place
[1:04:27] he reunited with the bread of his age
[1:04:34] but there was a little bit more above
[1:04:37] brother Brandon says
[1:04:43] and said some of them women there that
[1:04:45] you think was so beautiful
[1:04:49] we're better than 90 years old when you
[1:04:52] led them to the Lord
[1:04:54] no wonder they're screaming our precious
[1:04:57] Brothers
[1:04:58] they all screamed at once
[1:05:01] if you hadn't have went Nosotros
[1:05:05] we wouldn't be here
[1:05:09] in the Holy place
[1:05:12] where you had to first of all
[1:05:19] dressed
[1:05:22] and then qualified to entrance that's
[1:05:26] why your soul is
[1:05:31] to enter that place this body isn't but
[1:05:36] the soul is
[1:05:37] that's why their souls
[1:06:02] [Music]
[1:06:04] it's bread loose and Light
[1:06:23] I've got so many desires to see him
[1:06:27] he's somewhere just a little higher
[1:06:32] when we see the furniture of the
[1:06:35] Tabernacles
[1:06:36] we see it like this but for God he sees
[1:06:41] it like this
[1:06:53] the altar
[1:07:02] IO
[1:07:03] he's just a little higher right up that
[1:07:06] way
[1:07:08] he said someday he will come to you
[1:07:13] see he said you were just sent for a
[1:07:16] leader and God will come
[1:07:23] according to what you taught them
[1:07:27] if they would enter or not
[1:07:31] we'll go in according to your teachings
[1:07:35] I said oh I'm just so glad
[1:07:40] did Paul does he have to stand like this
[1:07:43] does Peter have to stand like this see
[1:07:46] yes
[1:07:47] I said
[1:07:51] then I preached every word that they
[1:07:54] preached
[1:07:57] I never divided from it to one side or
[1:08:00] to the other
[1:08:03] where they were baptized in the name of
[1:08:05] Jesus Christ
[1:08:09] were they taught of the baptism of the
[1:08:11] Holy Ghost
[1:08:12] I did too today
[1:08:15] whatever they taught
[1:08:17] I did too yeah
[1:08:21] and then people screamed and said we all
[1:08:23] know that is
[1:08:27] and we know we're going with you someday
[1:08:29] back to Earth Jesus
[1:08:33] they said Jesus will come and you'll be
[1:08:35] judged
[1:08:37] according to the word that you preached
[1:08:39] us
[1:08:42] and then if you're accepted at that time
[1:08:46] which will be
[1:08:50] and then you will present us to him
[1:08:53] as trophies of your ministry
[1:08:56] and said you will guide us unto him
[1:09:01] and all together we'll go back to the
[1:09:03] Earth to live forever
[1:09:10] so you could see what it was in the Old
[1:09:12] Testament it was just a shadow
[1:09:16] of what happens with us today
[1:09:24] they're placed La significance they're
[1:09:28] located in this in the meaning so
[1:09:30] significance that meaning and that
[1:09:33] importance is
[1:09:35] located throughout the dimensions
[1:09:39] our bodies the ones we carry
[1:09:42] they're in the outer courts
[1:09:45] they're not allowed to enter into that
[1:09:48] that's why when we enter into that place
[1:09:51] we need a new body
[1:09:54] tomorrow
[1:09:58] now
[1:10:00] like we previously spoke upon okay
[1:10:05] the bread represents the body of the
[1:10:07] Lord
[1:10:11] we spoke about how does the brother
[1:10:13] Branham
[1:10:15] he types the hidden manner
[1:10:19] the bread that only the high priests
[1:10:24] he types it with the show bread
[1:10:28] the priests
[1:10:30] because both are special breads
[1:10:34] not anyone can just eat that bread
[1:10:38] now something funny I could find
[1:10:41] it was the measurements the
[1:10:44] La Mesa of the table
[1:10:47] of the show bread and then the
[1:10:50] measurements
[1:10:52] of the Ark of the Covenant
[1:10:55] that had the hidden manner
[1:10:58] both had special bread
[1:11:02] there's just a little difference between
[1:11:04] the both of them
[1:11:07] if you want to open your Bibles to the
[1:11:09] Book of Exodus chapter 25.
[1:11:12] verse 8
[1:11:16] now Moses was making the Tabernacles
[1:11:19] he'd make the Tabernacle
[1:11:23] according to the vision he had in heaven
[1:11:27] Exodus 25 8 says
[1:11:33] and let them make a sanctuary that I may
[1:11:36] dwell among themes
[1:11:44] according to all that I showed thee
[1:11:47] after the pattern of the Tabernacle and
[1:11:49] the pattern of the instruments thereof
[1:11:51] even so shall you make it
[1:11:53] now here in verse 10.
[1:11:57] it talks about the measurements of the
[1:11:59] Ark of the covenants
[1:12:01] that was in the Holy place the holiest
[1:12:04] of holy that had the hidden manner
[1:12:16] and they shall make an arc of wood which
[1:12:20] two cubits and a half shall be the
[1:12:22] length thereof and the Cubit and a half
[1:12:24] of the bread there of the breath thereof
[1:12:26] and the Cubit and a half of the height
[1:12:28] thereof so it says
[1:12:33] that was two and a half one cube and a
[1:12:36] half
[1:12:37] the the longitude era
[1:12:42] it was two and a half
[1:12:45] cubitsura and the width is
[1:13:26] shall be the length thereof and the
[1:13:29] Cubit the breadth thereof and the Cuba
[1:13:31] and a half the height thereofs
[1:13:34] so like you can see in the picture up
[1:13:36] here
[1:13:37] both Furnitures CNN La misma Altura
[1:13:42] they've got the same height
[1:13:44] once in the Holy place and one in the
[1:13:47] holiest of Holy Spirit
[1:13:49] but the difference between the both of
[1:13:52] them
[1:13:53] both have both have special bread
[1:13:56] both are made of wood
[1:13:59] then covered by gold
[1:14:02] but the difference between that one and
[1:14:04] this one
[1:14:06] in this photo here
[1:14:09] the difference is just a half
[1:14:13] just like these two pulpits here
[1:14:16] the difference between this one and this
[1:14:18] one
[1:14:19] it's just this half here
[1:14:22] these half pieces that we have here
[1:14:25] special they both have special bread
[1:14:37] but the length and the width is
[1:14:41] it's just half bigger
[1:14:45] brother
[1:14:49] this is Redemption is
[1:14:52] in two parts
[1:14:54] or two halves
[1:14:58] the holy place
[1:15:01] it has both parts
[1:15:03] of the Redemption that you need
[1:15:10] that's why we still haven't reached a
[1:15:12] full Redemption yet in this body the
[1:15:15] soul yes but not this body
[1:15:20] difference
[1:15:21] so then the difference between both
[1:15:23] Furniture Amazon
[1:15:25] both are the same height but this one
[1:15:30] it has two halves
[1:15:33] one half wide
[1:15:36] Largo and then one half long Maz Grande
[1:15:39] that's larger than this one
[1:15:43] now brother Brian says in the message
[1:15:46] the resurrection of lazaruses
[1:15:53] and thank you to God that we're still on
[1:15:55] the Victorious side today
[1:15:58] because we're in Christ
[1:16:01] and half
[1:16:06] has never yet been told
[1:16:10] the difference between these two
[1:16:12] Furnitures was just a single half yeah
[1:16:15] and here brother Branham says
[1:16:21] has never yet been told
[1:16:24] it's in its infancy yet
[1:16:30] but watch it when it comes out of its
[1:16:33] Great Seal yonders
[1:16:36] it'll be a time when this whole world is
[1:16:41] going to receive a shaking like it's
[1:16:43] never had before in all the days
[1:16:46] the prophet is telling us
[1:16:49] that the half that's in the Holy the
[1:16:51] holiest of holies
[1:16:53] which was just the Covenant the ark
[1:16:58] that had the hidden manner
[1:17:01] one day that manner
[1:17:51] just look at the back of it
[1:17:54] there is a pyramid on the other side on
[1:17:58] the other side
[1:18:00] there's the Seal of the United States
[1:18:05] why would the United States recognize
[1:18:07] under the pyramid
[1:18:09] the great seals
[1:18:12] just look above that top stone
[1:18:16] that topped off the pyramid
[1:18:20] and you see it standing up with that
[1:18:22] light shining around it
[1:18:27] around the sea for what is it up there
[1:18:29] for it says
[1:18:31] that's the Great Seal
[1:18:51] it's in the Cornerstone
[1:18:55] so then the Cornerstone is
[1:18:58] the holiest of holy
[1:19:35] what is the part of the body
[1:19:38] that we have received
[1:19:40] let me tell you what part
[1:19:44] the head
[1:19:46] is this is the bread
[1:19:49] that we have received in the sage so
[1:19:53] therefore
[1:19:55] because the head is the last part of the
[1:19:58] body
[1:20:00] there's no other new message no I must
[1:20:03] lose there's no more light okay then
[1:20:06] this message
[1:20:12] or the Capstone
[1:20:15] it has the light of the Shekinah Glory
[1:20:18] there's no other life that's better than
[1:20:21] that life
[1:20:35] that's better than this message
[1:20:40] this message
[1:20:42] it has the hidden manner
[1:20:46] that no one could receive in previous
[1:20:49] ages
[1:20:50] the revelation of the Seven Seals
[1:21:19] and the message is this the end uh is
[1:21:22] this the sign of the answer
[1:21:24] paragraph 204 this is
[1:21:27] it first a
[1:21:31] blasto and I thought it sounded like a
[1:21:33] sound barrier
[1:21:36] ever what you call it when the planes
[1:21:39] cross that sound
[1:21:40] and the sound comebacks to the Earth
[1:21:51] then it could have been just a great
[1:21:53] clap of thunder
[1:22:03] that sounded like it was the South for
[1:22:05] me from Mexico
[1:22:07] but it shook the Earth
[1:22:10] and when it did
[1:22:14] I was still looking Westward
[1:22:17] and way off into eternity
[1:22:21] I saw a constellation of something
[1:22:23] coming
[1:22:25] and it looked like there may have been
[1:22:27] little dots
[1:22:30] there could have been no less than five
[1:22:32] or no more than seven
[1:22:36] but they were in the shape of a pyramid
[1:22:40] the Great Seal is
[1:22:43] the Cornerstone
[1:22:47] any one of us could see
[1:22:50] they're on the American bill dollar bill
[1:22:53] even our money
[1:22:55] speaks about this message
[1:23:16] there is hidden manna
[1:23:22] um
[1:23:26] brother Brown says in the message a
[1:23:28] hidden life
[1:23:36] and listen I will give him of the Hidden
[1:23:39] manner amen
[1:23:41] amen I will hide him away
[1:23:50] and I will give him the hidden things of
[1:23:52] the world on the outside of the curtain
[1:23:54] that don't know nothing about it
[1:24:00] but they don't know about this
[1:24:03] I will give to him the hidden manner
[1:24:07] I will give to him the hidden manner
[1:24:10] with us with this stone with his name on
[1:24:12] it
[1:24:13] you see what I mean
[1:24:17] entering into the adoption
[1:24:21] or the hidden place with God
[1:24:32] throughout the time of adoption
[1:24:37] now the hidden manner is
[1:24:42] and the Ark has a covering or a lid
[1:24:46] in English
[1:24:48] and in English is The Mercy Seat
[1:25:05] then it's judgment
[1:25:12] there was that hidden manna
[1:25:17] is
[1:25:20] now like I said this is our hidden Mana
[1:25:23] for today is this is
[1:25:27] the most special bread in the whole
[1:25:29] world
[1:25:30] there's no bread or bread
[1:25:32] then this bread
[1:25:35] there's no better message than this
[1:25:38] message
[1:25:45] being that this is a part of the bread
[1:25:47] or the body
[1:25:49] that was manifested in this age
[1:25:53] being that bread is also the word of God
[1:25:57] this bread has to be in the word an
[1:25:59] apocalypse in Revelation 5
[1:26:01] from one to seven
[1:26:06] he talks about God's Throne
[1:26:09] now remember the Mana is
[1:26:15] under God's Throne there where the
[1:26:18] throne is there was the hidden manna
[1:26:23] Revelation 5 1 says
[1:26:30] and I saw on the right hand of him that
[1:26:32] sat on the throne a book written
[1:26:36] within and on on the back side sealed
[1:26:38] with Seven Seals
[1:26:45] and I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:26:47] with the loud voice who is worthy to
[1:26:49] open the book and to lose the seals
[1:26:51] they're up
[1:26:56] and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth
[1:26:58] neither under Earth was able to open the
[1:27:00] book neither to look
[1:27:05] thereoning
[1:27:09] and I wept much because no man was found
[1:27:12] worthy to open and read the book neither
[1:27:14] to look upon look there on you know
[1:27:25] and one of the elders unto me said weep
[1:27:29] not Behold The Lion of the tribe of
[1:27:31] Judah the root of David hath prevailed
[1:27:33] to open the book and to loose the Seven
[1:27:34] Seals thereof
[1:27:37] Los Cuatros
[1:27:43] and behold and lo in the midst of the
[1:27:46] Throne of the four beasts and in the
[1:27:47] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[1:27:50] had been slain
[1:27:51] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[1:27:53] are the seven spirits of God and sent
[1:27:55] forth into all the Earth
[1:28:44] Jesus Christ himself
[1:29:25] it's that same lamb
[1:29:28] descending into the Earth
[1:29:33] now here the lamb has the hidden Manna
[1:29:35] in his hands
[1:29:37] will he give us that bread or will it
[1:29:41] just be for him
[1:29:43] Revelation 10 1 says
[1:29:50] and I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[1:29:52] from heaven cloth with a cloud
[1:29:55] what is Mana pan bread
[1:29:58] from Heaven to Los Angeles of the angels
[1:30:02] that comes to the Earth
[1:30:05] and now the taste of that bread is honey
[1:30:10] did you know that span it's bread
[1:30:14] that was made by angels
[1:30:17] that was in heaven
[1:30:20] they'd come down from heaven to the
[1:30:22] Earth
[1:30:23] and it speaks now of an Angel
[1:30:28] covered clothed with a cloud
[1:30:32] that comes down from heaven here on the
[1:30:35] Earth
[1:30:40] and a rainbow was upon his head and his
[1:30:43] face was as the sun and his feet pillars
[1:30:45] of Fire
[1:30:47] and he had in his hand a little book
[1:30:49] open
[1:30:54] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[1:30:56] and is left upon the Earth
[1:30:59] is
[1:31:07] and the voice which I heard spoken to me
[1:31:09] again and said go and take the little
[1:31:11] book which is open in the hand of the
[1:31:13] Angel which standeth upon the sea and
[1:31:15] upon the Earth
[1:31:17] this message
[1:31:20] it has both parts of redemption that you
[1:31:22] need this message is this book that was
[1:31:27] open
[1:31:29] and it was the high priest
[1:31:32] that he himself as an angel
[1:31:35] descended upon the Earth
[1:31:37] with the hidden Manna in his hands
[1:31:41] and Mana must be eaten
[1:31:45] that's why in verse 9
[1:32:11] is the hidden manner
[1:32:42] never lose its honey
[1:32:51] we're at the head
[1:32:57] notice that it would be bitter to thy
[1:32:59] belly
[1:33:02] brother Brandon says the hidden Madness
[1:33:07] in the time of adoption
[1:33:10] and adoption is
[1:33:13] it's the most bitter trial that one goes
[1:33:17] through is
[1:33:20] brother Brandon went through a very
[1:33:22] bitter trial
[1:33:24] during the time of his adoption
[1:33:29] when this part of the body was
[1:33:32] manifested
[1:33:34] issue
[1:33:42] because the honey will help with the
[1:33:47] bitterness
[1:33:51] some months ago
[1:33:55] I got sick of my throat or my nose
[1:33:57] something like that
[1:33:59] my mother
[1:34:02] a home remedy yesterday that home remedy
[1:34:07] was vinegar
[1:34:09] apple cider vinegar
[1:34:13] something so horrible and so disgusting
[1:34:18] I looked like a little kid my mother
[1:34:21] yelling at me
[1:34:23] Emmanuel just drink it drink it no no no
[1:34:25] no I don't want to don't make me do it
[1:34:29] don't make me drink it Mom
[1:34:33] but that vinegar was something good for
[1:34:36] me but since it's bitter
[1:34:39] we don't want it
[1:34:41] the adoption it's bitter
[1:34:45] but God also has to give you honey
[1:34:49] for you to go through that bitterness
[1:34:53] and brother branham's honey
[1:34:57] that's for the bitterness of his stomach
[1:35:00] issues
[1:35:04] and at the last part of his life
[1:35:41] for that bitterness
[1:35:54] verily verily I say unto you he that
[1:35:57] believeth on me hath everlasting life
[1:36:01] I am the bread of life
[1:36:04] and when this bread is
[1:36:07] this part of the body
[1:36:09] photography it was photographed
[1:36:13] it was published in a a newspaper life
[1:36:18] that's a magazine called life
[1:36:22] I have a picture can you show it to me
[1:36:24] this is
[1:36:27] I am the bread of life
[1:36:30] this bread is this part of the body is
[1:36:35] it's life for you
[1:36:39] is
[1:36:45] this is the bread which cometh down from
[1:36:47] heaven that a man that eateth thereof
[1:36:49] will not die Jose
[1:37:02] I am the living bread which come down
[1:37:05] from heaven and if any man eat of this
[1:37:06] bread he shall live forever and the
[1:37:09] bread that I will give is my flesh which
[1:37:11] I give for the life of the world
[1:37:14] brother says now to end
[1:37:18] the message what does it take to make a
[1:37:21] Christian Life
[1:37:22] paragraph 43.
[1:37:27] We live because something died
[1:37:30] if you don't live today
[1:37:33] if you don't eat dead substances
[1:37:41] our natural life is only by dead
[1:37:43] substances
[1:37:52] fine if we eat bread
[1:37:55] the wheat died
[1:37:57] something has to die
[1:38:03] so we physically can live again
[1:38:08] because we are the substance of the
[1:38:10] earth
[1:38:13] and that's the way we're taking the
[1:38:16] substance to Keep Us Alive
[1:38:24] something had to die
[1:38:28] so that you could live eternally
[1:38:44] let's stand
[1:38:52] remember
[1:38:54] this message
[1:38:58] the best that God has given
[1:39:00] there's no other message there's no
[1:39:03] better bread there's no better light
[1:39:07] if you've got some bitterness
[1:39:11] there's honey in this message
[1:39:15] let us pray
[1:39:18] Heavenly Father we thank you this
[1:39:20] morning

[1:39:41] something so bitter in your last moments
[1:39:44] of life
[1:39:45] but then when you resurrected
[1:39:48] you asked for food
