where is [Music] God bless you this evening Brothers uh it's good to see you all once again from this side of the pulpit got a little tongue tied for a second I tend always greet in Spanish and then start ministering in English I think I just need to start ministering in Spanish again but God bless you all this evening we welcome everyone in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ no I I I had a sister approached me not too long ago a sister that I love dearly she might not know it and she asked me she kind of like uh a little bit almost like scolding me but she asked me brother when are you going to start preaching again don't worry sister uh they have me scheduled soon but if it was me I'd probably run as far away as I could but I'm just trying to call my nerves forgive me um since since I have you all standing if you do me a favor of opening your scriptures at this moment we're going to turn to the book of 2 Corinthians chapter 12 and we're going to read verses 9 and 10 I'm just trying to find the young people here tonight just to see who who I'm talking to this evening all right amen God bless you young people tonight this is youth service and we're happy and and and so encouraged to always minister to the young people 2 Corinthians 12:9 reads and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore I will rather glorify in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me therefore I take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in Necessities in persecutions in distress for Christ's sake for when I am weak then I am strong the definition of infirmities young people I I found was physical or mental weaknesses a physical or even a mental weakness so take pleasure in your infirmities if you be so kind to turn over to James chapter one we're only going to read four scriptures here verse two reads my brethren count it all joy when you fall into diverse [Music] Temptations count it Joy young people when the trials and the troubles come to your life verse three knowing this that the trying of your faith it worketh patience that this trial you have right now it it comes with the reward it's got a gift and a prize at the end of that trial but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing that that gift that will be given to you once you've gone through the trial once you've shown to be an overcomer like here it says the patience the gift of patience we got to let it grow and let it mature so that after the trial it can be found perfect complete it can be found sealed but we need the trial if we bow our heads for prayer [Music] Lord Heavenly Father How Great Thou Are We Love You Lord and we need you Lord and thank you for this youth service you've allowed us to have Lord thank you for this small thought you've put put in my heart that that it be you that speaks to these young people and our brothers and sisters tonight that it be not the the words of man but the words of God lord and all I ask is just simple words that can impact the Heart Tonight father we thank you for the trials that have got us up to this point for I look upon Overcomers this evening Overcomers that overcame to even be here tonight even the Overcomers that overcame to tune in online to watch this service tonight because we are loaded with trials but you gave them to us because you knew we could overcome so this evening Lord help us speak to us and just love us a little bit more we put this service in your hands bless the reading of the word and help me in my interpreter to just speak what you have for your people we ask you all these things and give you the honor and glory in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may all be seated thank you to the Musicians you all play such a a big part uh we read first cor second Corinthians and James and and to give it a title this evening I think the audio department is already connected in the spirit I didn't even tell them what the title was yet but I see it up top trials praise God for them I want to read a quote real quick from the message a second-handed robe says when I heard the pastor say this morning that many are becoming discouraged what we need brother is to take courage we need to be encouraged so we're going to need you to take some courage tonight we're praying that the minister can give some encouragement also tonight especially for our young people here brother Brandon says the trials may come we may we we never was promised to be immune from them but he give Grace to go through them and I like what he says right here if the mountain is too high to go over if it's too deep to go under if it's too wide to go around it notice the supernatural with this next sentence here he'll give Grace to just go right through it to do what the impossible you can go over it we can fly over the mountain you can dig to go under the mountain you can drive around your trials but take on that mountain head on and go right through it it's going to take something super Supernatural brother Brandon says that's right just don't worry keep your eyes on Christ for he's the only one that can get us through how many believe that tonight you know God's word says that my grace is sufficient and you know young people do we truly know what that means when we hear it said over and over and over to truly know my his grace is sufficient you know if we can compare to the ocean how much those those animals of the ocean they drink water constantly if we were all to just take as much buckets of water as we can and we need and everybody on this Earth there would still be more water in the ocean day after day if if we could take it a step further into the air of our atmosphere you know that if there's no way that we could inhale all the air and take it away from our atmosphere much less in the universe than in the cosmos well that is God's grace it never runs out it is more than sufficient it comes from an eternal being from an everlasting being that that Grace it's always got more to give and more to give and more to give you know young people that Grace that that they all sufficient Grace from God you know it's so much it's enough for my forgiveness there's enough Grace for your forgiveness there's enough Grace for your sins you might have committed if someone one day went to backslide there's Grace for your backsliding condition if there's a young person that has had bad thoughts this morning there's Grace for those bad thoughts if there's a brother or sister that didn't correct things this morning there's Grace for your bad actions that all sufficient Grace has been there and it's been mindful of you and I before the trial it's been help ful for you and I even before the trial and because it was present before it's going to be present during so it's going to get you through each and every trial you have right here right now you know Jesus said my strength is made perfect in weakness and you know I I don't see a weakness in my God I don't see a weakness in our Lord Jesus Christ and I was asking myself then how is that possible well I see the weaknesses Within Myself from this Fallen condition that I'm in and then I look back to the word and I remember that blind man how how there was no sin in his life for his life but yet he was crutched by an infirmity he was burdened by a weakness of being blind then you take the woman with the blood issue as far as I know she wasn't a secret sinner she wasn't living Unholy living in this dirty lifestyle but she had a weakness she was burdened by a sickness and that was of the blood issue that she carried for years so then through those weaknesses through my human weaknesses there is where God's strength is displayed there is where that power and that Glory can come into manifestation where through those weaknesses that each and every one of us have that strength is made perfect in us it's made visible and just undeniable through our weaknesses through our sicknesses through our infirmity brother brandom says in the message an ins sign many times people say you see all that sickness in that family I told you they're just not living right how that hurts so much to read something like that to think that sometimes we make mistakes like that to cast judgment like that brother brandham continues said they're not living right he says now God does do that sometimes so we're not ignoring that that does happen but brother BR says but not every time is it God doing that CU God's here and he's dealing with a saint no I'm I'm a bit of a dummy every now and then things pop up to me but it ain't too often he says not every time is God doing that cuz God's here dealing with a saint so even if it's that family that was living wrong or just one of us that just happened to fall in this trial brother brandom said he's dealing not with the sinner no he's dealing with Saints the saints that I'm looking at today maybe backsliding May maybe in sin maybe going through a trial of hell but I'm going to call y'all a saint because we are Saints he says he's dealing with a saint the trying and proving of a saint every man that cometh to God must first be tried of God and if he can't stand chastisement then you become an illegitimate child not a child of God trials to try our faith brother isn't it marvelous that God would give us those trials just to test and to prove us so so being a youth service we know you've got tests you've got trials sometimes you can't explain it maybe your dad's not a minister maybe you're too embarrassed to go approach the pastor but just understand the trials you're going through are given to a saint you are a saint and you need to be tested and proven the Bible says in Romans 8:28 we know that all things work for good work all things work together for good to them that love God and to them who are called according to his purpose is there young people that love God tonight okay I see some hands raised and now do you have the same kind of Faith to believe that you're called according to his purpose because it's a two-part thing here everybody claims to love him but are you called if you're doubting tonight I'm going to have a little bit of faith for you I have faith that you're called tonight I have faith that you've been an overcomer to be here tonight and there's a purpose in your life and in each and every one of those trials when I read this scripture the moment it became a revelation to me many years ago the word coincidence I threw it in the trash that word chance I got rid of it a long time ago that whole good luck bad luck thing no that don't exist over here with us this is all things work together for the good so the bad times good times my confusion my certainty and my trials they all work for my good and in James 1:12 says blessed is the man that endureth Temptation blessed are you young person that can endure the trials it says for when you are tried you shall receive the Crown of Life which the Lord hath promised to them and every one of you young people if I'm not mistaken you raised your hand to say you love him so it says this right here is promised to you all that raise your hand saying I love Jesus Christ you see each and every trial that we go through it it carries a god-sent purpose there's a god-sent reason for the trials we go through and and if we remember keep in mind nothing is a coincidence with God then the pain you're going through tonight the suffering you might be going through tonight the petition that maybe nobody else knows but you tonight that petition is not by chance it carries a god-sent purpose and if it's sent from God then God has got to have a god-sent answer because he doesn't leave anything undone whatever he started he's going to finish it if he's placed a trial in your life he's got to see the Fulfillment and the end of that trial in your life because before he placed the trial there he said you know what it's time for me to give my brother Jesse the gift of knowledge Jess he was already thinking of the gift before the trial but we focus on the trial and not the gift that's why I wanted you young people to keep in your heart blessed are you that endure that trial that Temptation This is a youth service I can't say it enough and I just want to stay simple again but if it if it applies to anybody else well amen if your trial has been you know a a courtship heartbreak if your trial has been a a broken heart due to a friendship if your trial is is a family member that's in deep sickness maybe your trial is a hardship in the church or even a hardship of a ministerial tension behind every trial there is a reward somebody here tonight through the trial that you're going through big or small short or long someone at the end of that trial after overcoming not my overcoming your overcoming but because he gave me that Grace and carried me to be an overcomer someone will receive Faith someone will receive receive virtue someone will receive knowledge someone will receive Temperance someone will receive patience someone will receive godliness brotherly kindness someone will receive agap love I was telling some brothers last weekend you know uh I don't know if they're here this evening but I was joking but at the same time a little serious saying you know I think I got the gift of patience and of temperance today because last minute I received a phone call from one of our teachers that they couldn't teach the little kids Sunday school our children of 4 to eight that is a very special age and if you've got children in that age group you know how special your children are now I've got special ways of discipline I've got special ways of Correction I've got special ways of instruction that's for my children they might not be the way you deal with your children but that's how I deal with my children and and it it was somewhat of a of a revelation to [Music] me in dealing with about 13 of our beautiful 4 to eighty olds you know I I just started thinking to myself you know the minister doesn't preach to a sheep he preaches to a flock of sheep the Deacon doesn't Deacon a sheep the Deacon he deacons a flock of sheep the pastor doesn't Pastor a sheep he pastors a whole flock of sheep so some kids might need this discipline some kids need this discipline some kids are taught visually some kids are taught verbally and and and and you know I came out with a very good lesson that Sunday of patience and Temperance but we have some very beautiful children here at Jericho Tabernacle and they did teach me a big lesson and it gave me a new respect for our teachers here in this Tabernacle for the time and the effort and the strength they have to to to love and teach our children because one day they'll be sitting in these pews one day they'll hear word that will resonate in their heart they'll say I remember sister Rachel she taught us about that I remember Sister Gabby she taught me about that and then you get a young man Minister like this and then they see wow I'm no longer like those little kids but pretty soon I'm going to be like that young man the the the the the growth and the maturity of our spiritual walk and how it all starts with the time and the care we give them in that Sunday school and I'm not trying to preach about Sunday school forgive me but it it I learned patience and Temperance I'll repeat it again but getting back to the topic this evening you know just think for one one second our Prophet said that we had to get in a state of desperation okay everyone seems calm tonight so imagine to go from your your Tranquility into desperation what does that look like what does that feel like he says so we got to get in a sense of desperation to wake up to come to the feet of Jesus many he says many times that's what it's going to take where you're in a corner and your only options is life and death so then I I think of that and I think of the trials that we're all going through and if God's trying to give us seal us with the next stature of a perfect man another gift I say if I'm going to get the GI uh G give given the gift of temperance now this is just me it might be different for you what would God do would he being that I'm from California make every single day for two years straight a slow driver get in front of me on the road and my flesh wants to just shout at him and curse at him and do all these crazy things and and I'm learning Temperance or or would he bring it more to toward the spiritual side and being that we we got to get in a state of desperation a trial is not a trial if it doesn't shake you up if it doesn't get you to a point where you can't find the solution where where you need help from somebody and the only somebody that can help you is our Lord Jesus Christ so I think maybe if I had to get the gift of temperance it might take a brother or sister in church to cross me so bad that that that's going to put me in such a drastic situation so uncomfortable so irritated that that I don't know where to turn that then the only person I can turn to is to my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ because I can't deal with him or I can't deal with this situation it's too much for me so we go to him to overcome and then we're given the gift we're sealed with with Temperance or maybe patience or maybe brotherly kindness or maybe even AAP love once again this was for me in the message Awakening Jesus brother Bram says he tries to prove us and see he tries to prove us and see where we'll stand or not take a Revival away start an argument in the church just to see what you'll do that's pretty deep just to see what I'm going to do if I'm going to put ey in this I'm going to put I in this to see what I'm going going to do says turn Satan loose among you and see how you'll stand now I'm maybe I'm crazy he didn't say to see how you'll fall to see how you'll get back up no to see how you'll stand some might stand leaning on the edge some might stand breathing heavy some might be so strong and mature be standing firm see how you'll stand let him strike you strike you with something to see what kind of stand you'll take that's profound to me in Simplicity and in its profoundness job said though he slay me yet I'll trust him so no matter what the trial he will put upon my life in the church out the church in my family out the family in my spiritual or in my natural though he slay me yet I will still trust him says Shadrach M and abedo said our God is able to Deliver Us from the fire but nevertheless we'll go in the fire because we're not giving up brother brandom says but we get all flustrated and you know like they did the disciples did he says because we're human just like they were so yes we can get a little religious sometimes we get a little Apostolic sometimes we can get a little excited sometimes but even brother Brandon brought us down to remind us yes you're going to be on the highs but you're going to have the lows too cuz don't forget we're still in this human body just like the disciples were 1 Peter 1:6 says wherein ye greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold Temptations young people Rejoice it's only temporary it's only for a season me and my brother Emanuel were just joking in the back there's a time for everything some of y'all are going to be going through it today while I'm kicking back today but then in a month from now I'm going to be going through it while you're enjoying of His blessings so young people it's only temporary verse 7 says the trial that the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire will be found unto praise honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ I think I spoke on this before but this is your faith Young people showing us how it's it's the equivalent of gold the most precious thing on earth and though it's the most precious thing on earth it can still be melted down and be nothing but your faith is more precious than gold cannot be melted down it will stand through the hands of time it be time tested Faith because it cannot perish it came from God and that of God is eternal so keep feeding that faith and feeding that faith and keep allowing the trials to grow that faith in your life because remember after the trials comes the reward I can't say it enough now we heard how brother brandham said take courage take courage brothers and then he said you need to be encouraged I'm I'm going to throw a little bit of encouragement to the young people verse eight says when whom having not seen you love in whom though now ye see him not yet you believe that is so tremendous to me you know so many people in here did not have the privilege of seeing brother brandham every one of us in here did not have the privilege of seeing Jesus Christ you know there's young people in here that they they didn't see brother Brandon much less Jesus Christ and now there's newborn babies here that are going to grow up they didn't know brother Johnny they didn't know brother Bernie they didn't know brother Brandon they didn't know Jesus but yet right here it's telling you I didn't need to see but I still love him I didn't need to see him but I still believe in him with all of my heart my brother Jesse that I work with you know he he gets on my case so much at work and he's been on this revival about Rahab and as I was reading this scripture it came to my mind about Rahab and how brother Brandon says she's a type of us the bride and she too she didn't need to see Moses she didn't need to see the pillar of fire she didn't need to prove through these people with Miracles and wonders but yet she believed she was a Believer and she received her reward for believing what is that reward verse 9 receiving at the end of your faith the salvation of your souls what greater reward than my eternal salvation you know I want to differentiate two things uh between happiness and joy you know happiness is is is to be said it's dependent on an emotion you know it's uh when someone does something nice to [Music] you H you feel happy you do something fun you get happy some someone gives you something sweet you get happy they're kind to you you get tingly and happy inside but now Joy it comes from a greater Source it penetrates and joy it doesn't just lie on the outside like happiness but that's something that's on the inside and the source of joy is God so Joy doesn't depend on an emotion it doesn't depend on my good circumstances you know I can have joy in pain I can have joy in the Sorrows I can have joy even in the afflictions because no matter what the trial is no matter what the sick sickness is what the heartache is if you're a son and daughter of God we should have an everlasting Joy flowing within us that's why Paul spoke about joy in the trials Peter spoke about joy in the trials James spoke about joy in the trials Jesus Jus Christ tells us to rejoice in the trials why because Joy isn't dependent on an emotion if it was my sick mom or dad my my lost job that they just fired me a church split or this or that it would crush my joy but joy is greater than happiness joy comes from a greater Source it doesn't rely on an emotion or a circumstance it is living off of the Holy Ghost itself in the Book of Job chapter 2 uh right around the 10th verse Job had just been told by his wife curse just forget about it Go Curse God and let's move on with our lives plain and simple she was blaspheming just curse God and let's get on with our lives job 2:10 says but job said unto her thou speakest as a foolish woman speaketh I I I I'd like to narrate a bit how how Jo might have been a little bit in his feelings at this moment What then shall we just receive the good hand of God and we shall not receive the evil like challenging her like trying to preach to her God only gives the good and what about the bad what about the trials what about the hardships do they not come from God does God not allow us to go through them and and and you know for certain people it might sound a little a little off for job to be saying shall we not receive evil but to to to destroy that thought the Bible itself says in all this that job said he did not sin with his lips so unlike his wife who blasphemed job was saying nothing but the truth it's good to have the blessings of God but we need to take the moments of trial and tribulations also because there's a gift there's a promise there something God's trying to give us in the message I know brother Brown says it is written in one of the scriptures in the Bible says trials are brought upon us are more precious to us than gold itself for it's God giving us these trials after we become his property our confession and our baptism and our promise to walk in life for him then every trial comes up then every trial comes upon us to perfect us for his glory it's to bring us to a place where God can make himself more real to us than he was before the trial comes now if I if we could end right here and I could just ask one question question why the trials would you be able to answer that tonight I cried so many times and rad this so many times and I asked the question why the trials and I know the answer but I couldn't stop reading why the trials it is to bring bring us to a place from this place your comfort zone your prayer room your study space bring us from a place where God to bring us forgive me to a place from this place to this place where God can make himself more real he's real to every one of you tonight I believe he's real to these young people in the back tonight but he wants to be more real more real than what than he was and he's very real he's shown himself so many times in my life he wants to be more real than he was before the trial came you are a saint you're going to stand in the trial you know God is real but God wants to be more real to you and how is he going to be more real to you with each and every trial we go through so now we can see we cannot ignore the trials in our lives in our families in our churches everywhere they need to come because he wants to show you how real he is brother BR says and I want to join in this morning with joob and say I've lived long enough to know that that is the truth I've seen it in my own life I've seen that in my own life that every time a great situation Rises that I just can't get around it or go under it or go over it God makes a way and he comes out glorious I just wonder how his grace ever does it that all sufficient Grace how does it do it brother Brown says but he does it it don't matter how it's going to happen when it's going to happen the way it's going to happen but it's going to happen he's going to do it tonight we're going to start closing if the musicians would like to come the word trial the there there the definition of the word trial I found two and before we stand I just want to go through a few more notes real quick it is a test of the performance the qualities or suitability of someone or something the performance qualities or suitability of someone or something definition two is usually over a test that's usually over a limited period of time to discover how effective or suitable something or someone is so we'll get the test to see how you perform to see what Christlike qualities you carry to see if you're suitable to carry his name and that test is only for a period of time and we'll discover how how effective or suitable we are but I'm not suitable I'm not effective there's nothing good in me he is suitable he is the effective one he carries all the qualities that I need so the trial I go through I go through it with him you know there's some famous quotes it says anything worth having is worth fighting for one that's similar to that one nothing worth having comes easy humanly speaking nobody wants the trials My Flesh hates the trial but my spirit has learned learn to love the trials you know Michael Jordan Jordan if he could be the best basketball player on Earth and never have to go through a trial he'd do it and be stamped as the best you know without having the trial Muhammad Ali muhamed Ali to be the best boxer ever if he could go through it without ever having a trial he would take it but then Jesus Christ brother what does that have to do with him Jesus Christ he also had a try he also had to be tempted he is the best he is the greatest he is my idol he is my love my husband my everything not some athlete not some movie star but even in his trial in seeing that the death was necessary he said the words let this cup pass over me the scriptures in Matthew 26 he said it twice and you can all stand forgive me he said it two times when he fell on his face have you ever prayed gotten so weak and you just fall on your face and you enter in a deep prayer with God I imagine that's what Jesus Christ was doing oh my father if it be possible let this cup pass for me he he it burdened him trials were difficult for him he is the god man he is the Son of God but young people if you ever thought that Jesus Christ didn't suffer what we suffered he wasn't tempted like we were tempted strug like we struggled he saw that death was approaching he saw that death was necessary brother brandham even says in the message Souls that are in prisoned now Jesus he prayed to dodge the cross the humanity in him might have been scared might have been worried might have been reasoning because death was approaching it was a burden that was too heavy for him but in both of these scriptures in Matthew he doesn't end there that's why I kept repeating it repeating it repeating it rejoice in your trials you are blessed to have your trials because after he said let this cup pass over me I can't do this is there any other way God any other way that this can happen but if not let thy will be done let thy will be done can you heal my father but if you don't Lord let thy will be done will you bring in my son or daughter but if you don't Lord let thy will be done fix the problems Lord I can't take it no more if you don't let thy will be done please bow your heads for prayer who shall separate us from the love of Christ Brothers shall tribulation distress persecution famine nakedness Peril the sword for as it is written for thy sake we are killed all day long we are accounted as sheep at the slaughter and in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is our Lord Jesus Christ there is no trial too great if you're going through the trial because you've got the strength strength that he's given you if you're going through the trial that's because he saw that there's a gift that you're going to receive not you might receive not youd like to receive but you will receive but we must overcome Lord heavenly father with hands raised this evening your word has strucken the hearts of your people Hearts have been touched tonight because we are aware Lord who does not have trials we all have trials Lord but we have a special gift we have a special word brought
