[31:09] bless every one of you this evening
[31:11] [Music]
[31:19] Lord Heavenly Father we come before thee
[31:21] this evening
[31:24] to ask you of your grace and your mercy
[31:26] conveying us
[31:29] you might come here to this building
[31:34] and also come to every one of us
[31:36] individually
[31:39] you know the needs that are in this
[31:41] place
[31:44] and you know the Intimate Secrets of the
[31:47] hearts
[31:50] so then you know how to minister unto
[31:52] every heart
[31:54] [Music]
[31:55] I said as we begin to speak
[31:59] that you could minister to your children
[32:03] that they can receive their answers and
[32:06] their blessings
[32:10] being that I don't know any one of their
[32:12] problems
[32:15] they can recognize it was not I foreign
[32:18] but it was the Lord Jesus Christ
[32:22] that simply decided to use a vessel
[32:26] to speak unto his children
[32:29] therefore we ask for your anointing
[32:33] and for your guidance this evening
[32:38] we asked for all this in the name of the
[32:40] Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
[32:46] as we're standing I'd like to go to the
[32:48] Book of Luke
[32:49] chapter 20.
[32:54] we're going to start with verse 9.
[33:01] Lucas
[33:02] Luke 20 9 says
[33:16] then began here to speak to the people
[33:18] this Parable a certain man planted a
[33:21] Vineyard and led it forth to husbandmen
[33:23] and went into a far country for a long
[33:26] time
[33:37] and at the season he sent a servant to
[33:39] the husbandmen that they should give of
[33:41] the fruit of the vineyard but the
[33:43] husbandman beat him and sent him away
[33:45] empty
[33:49] is
[33:53] and again he sent another servant and
[33:56] they beat him also and entreated him
[33:58] shamefully and sent him away empty
[34:01] foreign
[34:07] and again they sent a third and wounded
[34:09] him also and cast him out
[34:17] then said the Lord of The Vineyard what
[34:20] shall I do I will send my beloved Son
[34:22] that it may be it may be they will
[34:24] reverence him when they see him
[34:31] but
[34:34] when the husbandmen saw him they
[34:36] reasoned amongst themselves saying this
[34:39] is the heir come let us kill him and The
[34:41] Inheritance may be ours
[34:47] so they cast him out of the vineyard and
[34:49] killed him what therefore shall the Lord
[34:51] of The Vineyard do unto them
[34:53] is
[35:00] he said he shall come and destroy these
[35:03] husbandmen and shall give the vineyard
[35:05] to others and when they heard it they
[35:06] said
[35:17] and he beheld them and said what is what
[35:20] is this that is written the stone which
[35:22] the builders rejected the same has
[35:23] become the head of the corner
[35:32] whosoever shall fall upon the stone
[35:34] shall be broken but whomsoever it shall
[35:37] fall it will grind him to powder
[35:40] may the Lord has blessings to his words
[35:43] you may be seated
[35:52] this evening I want to continue speaking
[35:54] about the Cornerstone
[35:59] something that always seems so
[36:01] interesting to me the Jesus of Jesus
[36:06] when he speaks about the Cornerstone
[36:10] first of all he always
[36:14] speaks about a Vineyard
[36:18] so he first speaks of the vineyard
[36:23] and a Vineyard is where they cultivate
[36:26] grapes
[36:27] so that once it reaches its time
[36:31] they can take those grapes and eat them
[36:34] or create wine out of those grapes
[36:37] Jesus
[36:40] Jesus always wants for his Vineyards
[36:43] for them to give their fruit
[36:47] and when Jesus speaks of The Vineyards
[36:51] there's men that work in The Vineyards
[36:55] and then the time the season comes
[36:59] where the Lord or the master of The
[37:01] Vineyards
[37:04] he sends a man to get the fruit
[37:07] to get the good work
[37:10] to get the fruits of the spirit
[37:14] the laborers or the husbands
[37:21] they cannot give that fruit
[37:24] and like we spoke last time
[37:27] it's it's in waves
[37:31] waves of opportunity that God grants
[37:35] so Jesus speaks of the vineyard
[37:40] and since he spoke that they rejected
[37:43] the men that he sent
[37:48] he makes reference to the parable
[37:50] angular
[37:54] of the rejection they gave they gave him
[37:56] towards the Cornerstone
[37:58] brother Brandon says
[38:02] and the message is your life worthy of
[38:05] the gospel
[38:08] and he reads this scripture and then
[38:10] he's speaking about these Parables
[38:14] and he says in paragraph 35
[38:19] that happens in all ages
[38:22] the rejection
[38:24] of the Cornerstone is
[38:28] something that happens in every age
[38:32] he said it went back into all the ages
[38:42] and we find that Parables
[38:47] and how he sent his servants to collect
[38:50] from this Vineyard
[38:51] the first servant to come Casey
[39:04] and they run servant after servant off
[39:07] Los Hombres the cruel men
[39:11] the king finally sent his son
[39:15] and when the sun came we find out
[39:20] they said this is
[39:25] we'll kill him and we'll have all things
[39:27] Jesus said to them
[39:32] the king sent forth and slew those
[39:35] murderers
[39:36] and burnt their cities
[39:49] now when Jesus speaks about The
[39:51] Vineyards he speaks of Israel
[39:56] Israel were the first
[39:58] that received the opportunity
[40:01] to produce a good fruit foreign
[40:14] okay
[40:17] paragraph 39 he continues saying
[40:23] now him speaking directly to Israel
[40:27] the ones that was called To The Feast
[40:32] that I would also apply today to men
[40:36] like Iglesia the church
[40:39] who has been bitten Avenida La Fiesta to
[40:43] come to the feast
[40:44] and won't do it
[40:48] the spiritual Feast of the Lord
[40:51] and they won't do it they don't want to
[40:54] do it
[40:55] they've got other things to do
[40:58] they find excuses
[41:03] Jesus was trying to tell them that
[41:05] they're excuses
[41:07] was what killed the prophets
[41:37] and by doing so had made the word of God
[41:39] of no effect
[41:41] Lavinia now the vineyard is that's
[41:45] Israel
[41:48] and it says in the Bible in Isaiah
[41:50] chapter five
[41:51] verse
[42:01] now will I sing to my well-beloved a
[42:04] song of my beloved touching his Vineyard
[42:06] my well-beloved half the vineyard in a
[42:08] very fruitful Hill is
[42:23] and he fenced it and gathered out the
[42:26] stones thereof and planted it with the
[42:28] choicest vine and built a tower in the
[42:30] midst of it and also made a wine press
[42:32] therein and he looked that it should
[42:34] that it should bring forth grapes and it
[42:36] brought forth wild grapes
[42:40] now remember God wanted that first of
[42:42] all
[42:44] for Israel to produce good fruits
[42:47] in this case they're grapes
[42:51] but it did not produce the right grapes
[42:55] It produced wild grapes
[43:07] and now o inhabitants of Jerusalem and
[43:10] Men of Judah judge I pray you betwixt me
[43:13] and my Vineyards
[43:22] what could have been done more to my
[43:24] Vineyard that I have not done in it
[43:26] wherefore when I look that it should
[43:28] bring forth grapes brought it forth wild
[43:31] grapes
[43:40] and now go to and now go to I will tell
[43:43] you that I will do to my Vineyard I will
[43:45] take away the Hedge thereof and it shall
[43:47] be eaten up and break down the wall
[43:49] thereof and it shall be trodden down
[43:52] remember Jesus says
[43:55] because you've rejected
[43:59] what was first given to you it'll be
[44:02] taken away
[44:03] and given unto the Gentiles
[44:06] verse
[44:17] and I will lay it to waste it shall not
[44:20] be pruned nor digged but there shall
[44:22] come up Briars and Thorns I will also
[44:24] command the loud clouds that they rain
[44:27] no rain upon it and
[44:30] so for this entire time
[44:55] that God wanted to give the Holy Ghost
[44:57] to the Gentiles
[44:59] the spiritual condition of Israel
[45:03] it's like verse six
[45:14] ways and it shall not be pruned or dig
[45:17] but therefore come up Briars and Thorns
[45:19] I will also command the clouds that they
[45:21] Reign no rain upon it
[45:23] finally verse 7.
[45:30] for the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is
[45:33] the house of Israel
[45:36] so Israel was the first Vineyard they
[45:40] had the opportunity
[45:42] to produce the right grapes
[45:45] but since they rejected
[45:49] now they're left with nothing no fruits
[45:54] now there's a new vineyard
[45:58] remember these are the husbandmen
[46:01] that are working in the vineyard
[46:05] now First Corinthians
[46:14] for we are the laborers together with
[46:17] God ye are God's husbandry ye are God's
[46:20] Building is Jesus remember that's Jesus
[46:26] speaks first of all at the vineyard
[46:29] he connects that Parable
[46:31] onto the Cornerstone
[46:34] and Paul's doing the same thing
[46:40] for your laborers with God and your
[46:43] God's Building
[46:54] according to the grace of God which is
[46:56] given unto me as a wise master builder I
[46:58] have laid the foundation and another
[47:00] upon another building thereon but let
[47:03] every man take heed to his own building
[47:04] there upon
[47:10] for other Foundation can no man lay that
[47:14] is laid which is Jesus Christ
[47:17] so then the first Vineyard
[47:20] that was Israel
[47:22] the first labor a husbandry husband
[47:26] those were the citizens of Israel
[47:30] being that they rejected Jesus
[47:33] the new vineyard is
[47:36] for all the Gentiles and now the new
[47:40] husbands
[47:42] are those that Jesus
[47:45] that they preach the gospel
[47:49] says that the husband those are the
[47:53] preachers
[48:04] to produce good fruit
[48:09] you are The
[48:11] Vineyards and the preachers are the
[48:14] husbands
[48:17] they need to preach the good word of God
[48:22] to produce a good fruit in you
[48:27] now when Jesus speaks of the vineyard
[48:31] he connects it then to the Cornerstone
[48:35] in Isaiah 28 verse 16. this is
[48:51] therefore thus saith the Lord God behold
[48:54] I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone a
[48:57] tried Stone a precious Cornerstone a
[49:00] Shore Foundation he that believeth shall
[49:02] not make haste
[49:04] aura
[49:06] now that is the Cornerstone
[49:09] that's placed on Zion
[49:15] the first message I preached on the
[49:17] Tabernacle
[49:18] I spoke about Shiloh yeah
[49:21] and I spoke how it is
[49:24] it's a place and it's a person just like
[49:29] Jesus Christ
[49:33] but it's also God's Temple
[49:49] as a person
[50:45] the new vineyard
[50:48] be non-level it produces new wine
[50:50] recorded now remember the day of
[50:53] Pentecost
[50:56] they were so drunk
[51:00] they were saying we have new wine
[51:05] the right grapes
[51:09] remember when Joshua Los doses
[51:12] when both spies entered into the
[51:15] promised land
[51:16] and came back with the evidence
[51:19] they came back with grapes
[51:23] they said the land is good
[51:31] verse 5.
[51:36] now remember these were the husbands
[51:39] they killed the prophets
[51:41] and then finally they killed Jesus
[52:10] and it came to pass on the morrow that
[52:13] their rulers the elders and the scribes
[52:23] and ananiah and anus the high priest and
[52:27] caiphes and John and Alexander And as
[52:29] many were of the Kindred of the high
[52:31] priests were gathered together at
[52:32] Jerusalem
[52:34] so then here are the ancient husbands
[52:37] that cannot produce a fruit
[52:51] they're persecuting the new husband man
[53:03] and when they had set them in the midst
[53:05] they asked by what power or by what name
[53:07] have you done this
[53:12] then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost
[53:15] said unto them ye rulers of the people
[53:16] and Elders of Israel
[53:20] beneficios
[53:26] if we this day be examined of the good
[53:29] deed done unto the impotent Man by means
[53:32] he is made whole Los buenos Los nuevos
[53:34] labradores the new husbands
[53:38] are producing good fruits
[53:41] of Divine Healing
[53:44] verse 10.
[54:00] be known unto you all and to all the
[54:03] people of Israel that by the name of
[54:04] Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom ye
[54:06] crucified whom God raised from the dead
[54:08] even by him does this man stand here
[54:10] before you whole yeah
[54:21] this is the stone which was set not of
[54:23] you Builders which has become the head
[54:25] of the corner
[54:33] neither is there salvation in any other
[54:36] for there is none other name under
[54:38] Heaven given amongst men whereby ye must
[54:41] be saved
[54:43] so the new husband
[54:47] they're producing good fruits
[54:50] of Salvation and fruits of healing
[54:55] aura
[55:06] it was made solely the materials of
[55:10] materials from the Jews
[55:13] but when Solomon's Temple was made
[55:18] it was made from various materials from
[55:20] around the world
[55:22] now Moses
[55:25] it represents a single person it
[55:28] represents Jesus Christ now Solomon's
[55:31] Temple
[55:32] it speaks of another person
[55:35] of another body the multiples of a
[55:39] multi-member it speaks about the bride
[55:42] it speaks about God's children
[55:47] says in the message Israel in the church
[55:49] number two this is
[55:53] listen when they built the temple of
[55:55] Solomon
[56:00] they and any of you Masons now could get
[56:02] this pretty good
[56:04] they brought down Cedars down from
[56:06] Lebanon foreign
[57:00] but every one of them went together
[57:03] they started laying the thing
[57:07] putting the building up getting along
[57:10] fine
[57:13] and they found a funny looking Stone
[57:17] they didn't want that thing
[57:19] they said they don't belong here
[57:22] they kicked it out
[57:25] they throw it over the weed piles
[57:30] and come to find out they built on and
[57:33] on
[57:36] and they found that they come to find
[57:38] out the very Stone they had rejected
[57:41] was the Chief Cornerstone
[57:44] Jesus said so
[57:46] and today
[57:48] the methodists
[57:56] everywhere around
[58:10] in the building of the spiritual house
[58:12] is
[58:14] the holy spirit
[58:17] you're afraid of it foreign
[58:40] but there's a genuine article of the
[58:42] holy spirit in the baptism
[58:44] Los
[59:05] Angeles
[59:06] oh the the builders they're a different
[59:08] groups
[59:10] that reject that stone
[59:13] just like in the naturals
[59:16] they're building Solomon's Temple
[59:19] and they saw this strange Stone they
[59:22] threw it out they rejected it but then
[59:26] in the spiritual
[59:27] the husband
[59:30] those builders
[59:32] in other words the preachers the
[59:35] Ministers of the various groups they see
[59:40] Jesus Christ
[59:42] and you can see the reaction
[59:45] at the Cornerstone it can cause
[59:50] and since they don't want to act that
[59:52] way they reject it
[59:57] generation
[1:00:12] but thou O Lord shall endure forever and
[1:00:15] thy remembrance unto all generations
[1:00:25] thou shall arise and have mercy upon
[1:00:28] Zion for the time to favor her yea the
[1:00:31] set time is come
[1:00:34] now remember Scion is the place
[1:00:38] but the Bible speaks of Zion as a woman
[1:00:50] when the Lord shall build up Zion he
[1:00:53] shall appear in his glory
[1:01:00] to declare the name of the Lord in Zion
[1:01:03] and his praise in Jerusalem
[1:01:05] now Moses is Tabernacle
[1:01:09] there's a scripture where the Bible says
[1:01:12] God told Moses
[1:01:18] I will cause my name to be there
[1:01:22] and the name of that Tabernacle it was
[1:01:25] Jesus Christ
[1:01:28] now the name of the lord
[1:01:31] it's in Zion
[1:01:34] because when there's a matrimony
[1:01:40] the wife takes on the husband's name is
[1:01:45] you're the feminine aspect of God
[1:01:51] you're the feminine Tabernacle they came
[1:01:55] out of God because it came out of him
[1:01:58] you've got his name the Bible says
[1:02:02] that all of God's family
[1:02:07] all of God's family is under the name of
[1:02:10] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:12] all right
[1:02:15] now in regards to Solomon's Temple
[1:02:18] foreign
[1:02:24] distinct form
[1:02:27] in foreign
[1:02:58] to whom coming as unto a living Stone
[1:03:01] disallowed disallowed indeed of man but
[1:03:04] chosen of God and precious
[1:03:06] Vivas
[1:03:10] said
[1:03:15] sacrifices
[1:03:20] he also as Lively stones are built up a
[1:03:23] spiritual house and a priest a holy
[1:03:25] priesthood to offer up spiritual
[1:03:27] sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus
[1:03:29] Christ
[1:03:30] so then the various stones
[1:03:33] that were brought from different places
[1:03:36] it spoke about how the New Testament
[1:03:39] there will be living stones
[1:03:48] they'll come from different parts of the
[1:03:50] world
[1:03:52] to form God's house
[1:04:08] wherefore also it contained in the
[1:04:10] scripture behold I lay in Scion a Chief
[1:04:13] Cornerstone elect precious that he would
[1:04:16] that he that believeth on him shall not
[1:04:18] be confounded
[1:04:21] foreign
[1:04:26] let's go to Acts 2 1.
[1:04:33] now remember that's the Cornerstone
[1:04:35] principal that's the chief Stone
[1:04:39] and other Stones as well
[1:04:43] because Jesus is that Chief person
[1:04:48] that must be in God's house
[1:04:51] then all the rest come from
[1:04:54] but Jesus Christ is the main one
[1:04:57] just like us here
[1:05:00] there's many people here seated in the
[1:05:03] benches
[1:05:05] most important person that needs to be
[1:05:07] here is Jesus Christ
[1:05:22] had to be there
[1:05:27] Jesus Christ is the most important
[1:05:31] and we're built upon him
[1:05:34] but he's the foundation
[1:05:51] in Acts 2 1 it says
[1:05:57] and when the day of Pentecost was fully
[1:06:00] come they were with one Accord in one
[1:06:02] place
[1:06:09] and they were all filled with the Holy
[1:06:11] Ghost and began to speak with other
[1:06:13] tongues as the spirit gave them
[1:06:14] utterance
[1:06:21] and they were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews
[1:06:24] devout men out of every nation under
[1:06:26] Heaven
[1:06:27] remember they were Stones
[1:06:31] they were brought from various places on
[1:06:33] the earth
[1:06:38] of different nations
[1:06:42] verse 7.
[1:06:56] now when this was noise abroad the
[1:06:58] multitude came together and were
[1:07:00] confounded because that every man heard
[1:07:02] them speak in his own language
[1:07:08] and they were all amazed and Marvel say
[1:07:10] one to another behold are not of these
[1:07:13] which speak galileans
[1:07:19] and how here we every man in our own
[1:07:21] tongue wherein we were born
[1:07:25] since there were different people from
[1:07:27] different parts of the world
[1:07:29] they spoke in different languages
[1:07:31] but when the Chiefs the chief Stone came
[1:07:34] when Jesus Christ arrives
[1:07:37] everyone could understand
[1:07:42] now we've also had the Cornerstone in
[1:08:19] everyone could understand in their
[1:08:22] language
[1:08:26] they all got together perfectly
[1:08:31] with the help of that Chief Stone
[1:08:37] now the reason that that stone
[1:08:40] it's rejected
[1:08:43] brother Brandon says that it had a
[1:08:46] funny-like appearance
[1:08:52] or a freak Stone
[1:08:56] now if it was a freak Stone in the
[1:08:59] natural
[1:09:00] that has to be a freak Stone in the
[1:09:03] spirit
[1:09:04] is
[1:09:06] when a person receives the Holy Ghost
[1:09:10] they act in a way that's not common
[1:09:15] and all the rest that are looking at
[1:09:17] that person
[1:09:19] they say what's going on with that
[1:09:21] person
[1:09:24] that he's acting so strange
[1:09:28] that is the Holy Ghost
[1:09:56] but that is the Cornerstone
[1:09:59] that's the Holy Ghost
[1:10:03] remember now every one of those stones
[1:10:06] it had a different appearance to the
[1:10:08] others
[1:10:09] just like I'm different from Marcos
[1:10:13] Marcos does things that I'd like to do
[1:10:15] Marco
[1:10:18] says qualities that I'd like to have
[1:10:22] just like Marcos can do things that I
[1:10:24] can do
[1:10:26] God formed him different
[1:10:29] than how God formed me
[1:10:34] we're part of the same house
[1:10:37] foreign
[1:11:24] I just love that about you
[1:11:28] because every stone is different
[1:11:33] but every stone is essential
[1:11:36] in the Lord's House
[1:12:12] they
[1:12:20] rebuilt the temple
[1:12:23] and that's registered in Ezra 3-1
[1:12:29] it speaks about the Reconstruction of
[1:12:31] Solomon's Temple
[1:12:44] and when the seventh month was come the
[1:12:46] children of Israel were in the cities
[1:12:47] the people gathered themselves together
[1:12:49] as one man to Jerusalem
[1:12:53] now for you to see the importance of the
[1:12:57] first verse
[1:12:59] just observe the attitude that they had
[1:13:03] they were in unity
[1:13:05] if you go to acts 2. in English
[1:13:10] the Bible says in English that they were
[1:13:12] in one Accord
[1:13:15] not that they just got there
[1:13:18] and started to do whatever they wanted
[1:13:21] they were in one mind
[1:13:24] and then started to work
[1:13:31] and then God sent the Holy Ghost
[1:13:58] is required to lay the foundation
[1:14:02] verse two
[1:14:04] this is
[1:14:29] and his Brethren and building an altar
[1:14:32] of God and build an altar of the god of
[1:14:34] Israel to offer burnt offerings thereon
[1:14:37] as it is written in the law of Moses the
[1:14:38] man of God
[1:14:40] verse six this is
[1:14:50] from the first day of the seventh month
[1:14:52] began day to offer burnt offerings unto
[1:14:54] the Lord but the foundation of the
[1:14:56] Temple of the Lord was not yet laid
[1:15:15] and when the builders laid the
[1:15:17] foundation of the Temple of the Lord
[1:15:18] they set the priests in their apparel
[1:15:20] with trumpets and the Levites the sons
[1:15:22] of asaph with symbols to praise the Lord
[1:15:24] after the ordinance of David the king of
[1:15:27] Israel
[1:15:43] and they sang together by course and
[1:15:46] praying and giving thanks unto the Lord
[1:15:48] because he is good for his mercy
[1:15:50] endureth forever toward Israel and all
[1:15:52] the people shouted with a great shout
[1:15:54] when they praised the Lord because the
[1:15:55] foundation of the house of the Lord was
[1:15:57] laid
[1:15:59] now see the reaction
[1:16:02] that happens to these men
[1:16:05] when the foundation is laid
[1:16:23] they've got some type of reaction
[1:16:45] but many of the priests and Levites and
[1:16:48] Chiefs of the fathers who were ancient
[1:16:50] men they had seen the first house when
[1:16:52] the foundation of the house was laid
[1:16:53] Before Their Eyes wept with a loud voice
[1:16:56] and many shouted aloud for joy
[1:17:09] so that the people could not discern the
[1:17:12] noise of the shout of Joy from the noise
[1:17:14] of the Weeping of the people for the
[1:17:16] people shouted with a loud shout and the
[1:17:18] noise was heard afar off
[1:17:21] remember now every stone is different
[1:17:24] every person here is different
[1:17:27] it's the same holy ghost
[1:17:29] that enters the person
[1:17:32] but since the person is
[1:17:37] it causes a different reaction foreign
[1:17:58] different forms
[1:18:01] the same holy ghosts but in the
[1:18:05] individuals
[1:18:07] it causes a strange reaction in you
[1:18:14] when the Holy Spirit touches you he says
[1:18:16] I
[1:18:18] um the Holy Ghost
[1:18:20] it's represented as fires
[1:18:23] if natural fire touches you're going to
[1:18:26] shake your hand like this
[1:18:28] if the Holy Ghost Fire touches you
[1:18:32] know it'll make some type of reaction in
[1:18:35] you
[1:18:35] [Music]
[1:18:43] but every stone is different
[1:18:46] every person is different
[1:18:48] but when it touches you
[1:18:52] it causes you a reaction
[1:18:55] strange
[1:19:12] you think what am I doing
[1:19:16] I act like this is that's the
[1:19:20] Cornerstone
[1:19:21] the Holy Ghost
[1:19:23] foreign
[1:19:56] or Joshua
[1:20:42] does the work through his husband
[1:21:05] to bring forth the temperature
[1:21:08] to bring forth the Cornerstone
[1:21:33] it speaks
[1:21:45] of Jesus Christ
[1:21:47] as a high priest
[1:21:50] all right recording now remember cuando
[1:21:53] Josue el Guerrero now when Joshua the
[1:21:56] warrior
[1:21:57] he entered into the promised land
[1:22:00] with the people of Israel
[1:22:03] brother Brown says that represented how
[1:22:06] it is the Jesus Christ
[1:22:08] he takes us unto the promised land
[1:22:12] unto the promise of the baptism of the
[1:22:14] Holy Ghost
[1:22:16] so then Solomon's Temple foreign
[1:22:43] taking all the people back onto the
[1:22:45] Promised Land
[1:22:48] so those two
[1:22:51] important they are really important
[1:22:55] Jesus Christ as a high priest he is the
[1:22:59] Son of God
[1:23:01] brother Brandon says in the message
[1:23:05] the Mighty God unveiled before us he
[1:23:08] said
[1:23:11] then we find after his death burial and
[1:23:14] Resurrection
[1:23:17] he came to the day of Pentecost as Son
[1:23:20] of God
[1:23:22] the spirit
[1:23:25] in the form of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:28] what was he doing
[1:23:30] he was changing himself
[1:23:35] making himself known to his people in a
[1:23:38] different form
[1:23:40] like the Holy Spirit which is
[1:23:47] he came to deal through the churches as
[1:23:49] the Son of God
[1:23:51] the Holy Spirit
[1:23:53] that's why it's Jesus Christ the son of
[1:23:56] God
[1:23:58] but he also has his husband
[1:24:00] his ministers
[1:24:03] there's seven main ministers
[1:24:05] which are the seven Messengers
[1:24:24] it
[1:24:30] means the Lord the savior
[1:25:14] his husband
[1:25:17] in that photo there's two people that's
[1:25:20] Jesus
[1:25:21] and brother Branham
[1:25:25] now when you hear Brother Brian
[1:25:27] when he speaks about that photo
[1:25:30] brother Brandon never says
[1:25:33] that photo is of himself
[1:25:36] he says that's a photo of Jesus
[1:25:42] and Jesus allowed for him to be with him
[1:25:44] in the picture
[1:25:47] hey man
[1:25:48] so then if they criticize
[1:25:51] that we've got the picture of a man
[1:25:55] yes but it's because Jesus allowed him
[1:25:58] to be in the picture
[1:26:01] because Jesus Christ
[1:26:03] he is the Cornerstone
[1:26:08] and then all of us we are built
[1:26:11] upon that stone
[1:26:16] as a high priest
[1:26:19] he is a Son of God
[1:26:22] the Bible says
[1:26:25] in Hebrews 4 14.
[1:26:32] Jesus
[1:26:35] seeing then that we have a great high
[1:26:37] priest that is passed into the heavens
[1:26:39] Jesus the son of God
[1:26:42] our
[1:26:44] recording now remember
[1:26:48] it is the high priest
[1:26:51] with his Builder
[1:26:55] that they lay the temple
[1:26:58] they lay the Cornerstone foreign
[1:27:01] that's why the holy spirit is so
[1:27:03] important
[1:27:04] for every husband
[1:27:07] and for every builder
[1:27:10] in other words for other all preachers
[1:27:14] because Paul himself says
[1:27:17] once he's received the Holy Spirit
[1:27:20] I lay the foundation
[1:27:23] which is Jesus Christ
[1:27:27] that's why you require the high priest
[1:27:29] the Holy Ghost
[1:27:33] upon the physical body
[1:27:36] of a husbandman
[1:27:49] to produce good fruits
[1:27:53] it's not us
[1:27:56] I don't have the power of a savior I
[1:27:59] don't have the power of a Healer I don't
[1:28:02] have any of those Powers
[1:28:04] but if God can heal someone
[1:28:06] through a prayer
[1:28:08] [Music]
[1:28:11] it was not the minister
[1:28:13] it was God
[1:28:16] the Cornerstone the holy ghost
[1:28:20] that is in that husband
[1:28:23] because the husband is
[1:28:26] the one that does the physical labor
[1:28:47] but the orders come from him
[1:29:00] the honor and glorious for Jesus Christ
[1:29:05] there's no way for any of us
[1:29:11] deliver somebody
[1:29:14] it's Jesus Christ
[1:29:16] through the
[1:29:19] Builder
[1:29:22] construction that does a good
[1:29:24] Construction
[1:29:42] that produces the good fruit
[1:29:47] if we can stand
[1:29:56] let us pray
[1:30:00] Lord Heavenly Father
[1:30:03] well we thank you for your word Lord
[1:30:07] foreign
[1:31:16] that produces the good fruit
[1:31:47] bless the rest of the service
[1:31:50] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:31:52] amen
[1:31:53] God bless you
