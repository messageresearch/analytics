appreciate it anytime we have a chance to stand for our lord it's something that we should do I believe he stood for us on Calvary right it's an honor why don't we uh greet our our neighbors if you don't mind precious [Music] brother want to thank the musicians and the song leader they help set the atmosphere in here let us uh bow our heads and close our eyes oh glorious Heavenly Father for thou

that all here in Jericho may receive and as well as online father we give you all the honor father we ask that you break the bread of life to us for only the Holy Spirit can speak to us we love you and we give you all the glory in the name of our precious Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen amen praise the Lord let's go straight into our scriptures let us open our Bibles to First John 1 verse 5 someone say Amen when they have amen it reads as follows this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all verse six if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth verse seven but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us cleanseth us from all [Music] sin amen may God bless the reading of his word you may be seated thank you for your reverence for God deserves all the reverence so I'd like to title this sermon the Christian Light and as a subtitle a life in Christ can't go unnoticed so we know that God is light and as we walk with him in truth the blood of his son Jesus wipes us clean from all our sin that's a beautiful scripture of his grace what more do we want now on uh Monday when I was at work uh a young female coworker of mine she uh came up to me and uh asked me a question she asked me what was it that that that made me uh always be in a cheerful mood as in uh uh smiling happy uh never seen me upset and I explained to her that uh it was Jesus God changed me I told her I said I have my days I'm human too and she said that U many people there are negative and that they're uh usually usually always upset I told her that they're spirits that tormenting people and uh those spirits will try to uh ruin your day if we allow them to I believe that's the same in in uh many situations so the devil gets in at times and he tries to stir things up we need to learn to brush that off to keep our our eyes on Calvary love one another as much as we can and just continue forward and I just I just told her to to pray for them people and uh I I usually tell everyone that to to pray for one another something that's really important or even Jesus prayed for his 12 disciples the whole entire day before he made his choice who his disciples would be in uh Gethsemane in GE also he prayed to the father as as he was feeling the the anxiety and that of of going to Calvary something really tremendous it shows us that that he was human though he still had the Supreme deity in him he still knew what what he felt to be a human he felt every bit of pain for you and I that's a good God he the Creator stepped into his creation to save you and our and to save you and I for for for the sake of our Salvation so that we would have a way of Escape God that I leave his his gold streets and many mansions to come down here to to to to show you his way of humility to wash dirty feet to show us that humble way of a Christian that's a good God I'll serve that God I'll take my stand for that God I'll die for that God now uh let's uh read another scripture we'll go to uh John 8 verse2 then spake Jesus again unto them saying I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life so that is the light that that people see in Christian that like that young woman at my church they'll literally come up to you and say what is it it's that light that Jesus puts in you once you surrender to him you're new creature your old nature dies and and all you do is is think about Christ the minute you do something wrong you're trying to fix it you can't let the sun go down on on after you done tooken your wrath on someone or anything it's just something a Christian can't do that that light isn't from you and I but from our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ when we walk in the light we have fellowship with him let let us read a sermon of brother branham's titled his wonders to perform uh preached in 58012 12 paragraph 30 I believe and as they were reading and uh the sacred fire was burning they worshiped the one true God by a sacred fire they watched the licking of the blazes for they knew that the one true God dwelt in light and that's true God dwells in light when he was on Earth he manifested in flesh he said I am the light of the world because God was manifested through him and he was the light the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel he was a light that struck Paul down on his road to Damascus he was a light that come into the prison with Peter he's the light that's on that picture he's the light that's in my heart he's the light that's in this church he is the Everlasting Light and in him is no darkness and they who walk in the light have fellowship with one another while the blood of Jesus Christ God God's son cleanses us from all sin walking in the light you have fellowship with the Baptist you have fellowship with the Methodist you have fellowship with the Pentecostal you have fellowship with God's children in every denomination if we're walking in the light don't worry that light will lead you amen amen how can people in the world deny or disbelief that Jesus Christ Rose from the grave the evidence lays right before their eyes and you and I it's a radiant and and it's radiant and captivating especially to those without it it oozes out of us like a volcano you can't miss it when it's around you so much that people will literally come up to you and ask you what is it why are you always happy I never see you mad this that's not our nature he's asked us to Rejoice the debt is paid already we have eternal life that is all the more to fight for it God is amazing he's my everything I can't live without him and we should all feel that way all is well when Jesus comes to stay when he enters in your heart you're like that bubbling stream brother brandom talked about he asked it is it the deer that drink from you is it so and so animal that drink from you is it that I drink from you no the the the the bubbling stream would tell him that no it's none of that it's something behind behind me making me Bubble that's what the born again Christian feels like something behind you just pushing you you can't stay at home you want to come to church and serve the Lord you want to see your brothers that you're going to spend eternity with it brings Joy To Your Heart brother brandom says to be a Christian is to live for others it's my pleasure to take my stand with the breth Nam Chandler if they're opening a door where I can get behind the pulpit and I can let their precious Pastor there relax and enjoy a sermon oh it's my pleasure the Lord Honors that I want to earn my way up there God is good your joy and happiness is that light that Christ puts in you and it can't be hid people see it and they feel it they know you aren't the same they know something's different about you that's the truth let's go to Matthew 5:14 we'll read up to the 16th verse ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a Candlestick and is giveth light unto all are in the house verse 16 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven amen amen that light should go with you everywhere that you go if it doesn't follow you you're somewhere you shouldn't be and the holy ghost that light that's in you flies away like a dove from you and it lands in a Tree near you and it waits for you to make right patiently it's waiting there for you to come and make right so we can enter back in with you and have Fellowship but once again when you got it it will be noticed it can't be hid the very nature isn't of this world you're a new creature it isn't you anymore but Christ Jesus living in you now God reminds us to be courageous in his word as found in Joshua 1 n have not I commanded thee be strong and of good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee withs soever thou goest now that scripture for all of us given from given from God but he wants courageous youth that'll take their stand and say to the dirty Ling devil like David said in his youth he told Goliath look here you uncircumcised Philistine I will not allow you to defile the armies of the living God I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts and this day will the Lord deliver your head into my hands oh yes with Valor and courage in your heart he wants you to be a warrior for him he wants you to not be afraid to take your stand for him as I said earlier he took his stand for us on Calvary we ow him our lives he shed his innocent blood as a sinner in our place that penalty and debt he paid was a brutal suffering yet whipped bleeding and beat to a pope he still had to carry that cross up to Calvary in the midst of being mocked and spit on he was exhausted and thirsty when he reached the top of the mountain all this suffering was done for us it makes me want to do something for his kingdom if he's asked me to die to this world and pick up my cross that's what I'll do he's not asking me to go hang on a tree there's so much that we need to to to understand that he gave us his all when he had all up there already but yet he wanted a fellowship with us and he came down and took that sacrifice now like uh on S on Saturdays I like to hike when I when I have the chance I wear a a lot of camel it's like brother Brandon when he said that he never got to go into the military or or the army or anything but he's in the army of God really but I like to wear an Air Force hat Air Force and it it reads uh Special Operations and of course you guys know I'm not a service member of our military but it has a spiritual meaning behind it the Air Force jets take flight through the air and I believe one day I will too but even further and faster than that in a twinkle of a I will be changed my friends the Air Force won't be able to keep up with usce now I ask you you can call that special operation we need we need to continue fighting with the mighty light he's given us as you know it's not the size of the dog in the fight it's the size of the fight in the dog and when the Holy Spirit becomes to come down on his people get ready buckle on that whole armor of God because he's alive he's not dead brother brandham says that we're a shadow of his and he's more alive than us so when we can comprehend that oh we're going to get somewhere with our Lord we should take it like when you see a dead animal on the side of the road and it's been there for a few days we'll say we'll say it's a dog after a few a few days the the body becomes starts to shrink and spiritually in in in our way when we die to this world when we're born again we as well should shrink and become small before the Lord not only before the Lord but before his people operate with love respect and know when the devil's sneaking in the camp that dirty devil out you guys know he's a liar we got to keep our eyes on he's trying to break us but God's program is always right on on on Perfection as his word that's the truth and nothing but the truth brother brandom says we're not on a picnic but we're in a battlefield it's not against mortal flesh but against spiritual wickedness in high places it's a spiritual warfare we must not only put the whole armor of God on but we must keep that light within us until the end of the world and if you don't stay prayed up and filled with the word of God by pressing play or reading the word Satan and the world will begin to settle in your house let us stay Gun Barrel straight on this unadulterated word of the Living God that's what we need to do we need to continue loving and respecting one another as we should for it is love that conquers all and which cast out all Devils too now at times I can be nervous and I've seen other brethren in the same condition whether you're doing something for the Lord or just a nervous person in general you know brother brandom says you know what he says about nervous people that they're the most spiritual people so don't count them people out you pray for them we're all in the same fight we're all trying to make it home we all want the best for one another regardless of our titles regardless of who we think we are in in in the way of of uh living in this world sometimes uh we'll have a a position in in the world as in uh at our jobs we may we may make uh good money and like brother brandom says you'll buy yourself a fur cat and you'll drown in the rain you walk with your nose in the air that's that's not that's not the Christlike way need we need to be humble as possible love one another live according to this word we can prepare and and work hard save our money and and have good jobs but don't don't let it change your character keep Christ in your heart love your fellow Brethren with with all you have the minute you get in a bad Vibe with the brother I want you to go look in the mirror look at yourself first ask the God as ask the god of of of this might Mighty word to change you that you don't want that bitterness in your heart you know uh brother brandham says it's okay to disagree with your brethren but you need to love him and and I can raise my hand I live that I love my lord for the scripture says he that said says he loves God that he has not seen and hates his brother that he has seen that's a liar I don't I don't I don't think we have any of them here I see the bride of Christ here God is good praise the Lord for it is love that conquers all as I said we can only continue uh letting the Lord lead us we should always stay in unity as Brethren and uh uh many of you know and and I'm not ashamed to to admit it my fellowship isn't the greatest so I ask you to keep me in prayer because in that same way God knows what you need God knows you're not ashamed to ask your brethren for help for prayer because you want your heart to be changed we're all God's light in progress we all have trials we all have our battles we all have a duty Jesus said to go out to all the world and preach the gospel and to baptize in his name and these signs would follow them that believe that's your duty as well you can talk to your neighbor talk to your co-workers it's not just the Ministries team's job it's not just our precious pastor's job each and every person in Christ he's he's given us that that last commission we should obey it let's go to a sermon uh titled the Shalom shom preach 64119 paragraph 223 or or it might be 92 now the same word that was reflected in Moses could not be reflected in Elijah because that's another day same one that was reflected in Noah could not be in Moses cuz see Noah built an ark Moses led a people just exactly what was promised the same light was reflected in one wasn't in the other but one told of the other one all of the New Testament speaks of this hour Jesus Christ speaks of this hour who is then some man it's Jesus Christ the son of God manifes and reflecting the light on the word that he promised for this day when men see you living like him when he sees your character your conduct with the word just exactly like he was the word being manifested then men will see Jesus Christ they won't have to look around anywhere and say what does this Creed teach what does that Creed teach they'll know what God is when they see you shalom shalom God's peace be with be be light upon you and when God's word is Vindicated in this age completely and you see it and believe it Shalom to you Shalom so when the Lord Jesus Christ is with us we have peace with all it doesn't matter the denomination or religion we should love all we should forgive all too in this time and age we're living in the world is dying for love we know that God is love and if love conquers all then in that matter we must operate not only to one another as fellow Brethren but with everyone in the world in hopes that we can win souls to the Lord through that light of love my friends in uh 1 Corinthians 16:14 it reads let all your things be done with Charity amen amen charity is love as we know let all things be done with love God help us to live this unadulterated word we're the world's hope those who live and worship in spirit and in truth where the Holy Spirit can operate in to save anybody that will come to the feet of Jesus Christ he he said and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out in order for faith in the Son of God to establish inside of you it must first be founded by love in your heart he loves you and he loved you uh before the foundation of the world and he gave his life for the entire world not just the Christian but even that the ones that were were were lost and many are not going to make it as we know but the pardon's there we have free moral agency let's uh read another sermon uh preached in 5607 2 titled love the 20th paragraph I think love is the greatest Force there is in the world there's nothing more powerful than love if I had the choice tonight and was a sinner and was standing here before God and he would have said now boy I'm going to give you all my spiritual gifts I'm going to let you prophesy give you the spirit of Prophecy I'm going to make you a mighty preacher give you the word of wisdom and understanding I'm going to give you the the gift of speaking with tongues and to interpret I'm going to give you a gift of healing that you'll have great faith for the sick and I'm and I'm going to do all these things for you I'll give you all that or I won't let you have any of those things but let you have Real Love in Your Heart I'd say God give me love for where there for where there is tongues they shall cease where there's prophecy it will fail where there's knowledge it'll vanish but where there but where there is love it will endure forever that's what the that's what drove the heart of God to send Christ to the Earth amen amen let us so love the world like God Almighty my precious brothers and sisters that'll fix many problems and win souls for God so help us Lord once that true uh personal revelation of the magnitude of what Jesus Christ did for you drops down into your heart you want the Christian light only he can give to you you begin to hunger and thirst for righteousness so that you can be filled you no longer care who's looking at you or what they think of you as you raise your hand to worship Him you begin to want to live for him in every way you run away from the world and pick up your cross your heart is set a flame for the Lamb of God who made a way of Escape for you you begin to try to speak about Jesus to those who will give you their time you begin to pray for your co-workers you really know nothing about and many others your old nature was dead a new Christian Light lives in you giving you an undescribable undescribable love and peace and as well as Joy you pass from Death unto life and the world can see it I pray if you know nothing what I speak of that you'll speak to Jesus where you're at now and ask him to enter in that you will want his light and his love in your life let's go to a second Corinthians 46 it reads as follows for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ thank you Lord let's read another sermon the last one preached in 54321 paragraph 47 titles uh the name of the title is what think ye of Christ looking at those little sparrows laying there I said to the guide what I said to the guide that that was with me I said what's the matter with them little birds he said they they died last night said there was a storm come up and they was flying right in the storm and said they come they come into the light instead of using the light from the Statue of Liberty said those are un they come try to dock the light out and they beat against it with their little heads until they beat their brains out and they're laying there dead because they refuse to follow the light they tried to beat it out I said oh God what an example it is and men and women raising up today and people who are trying to deny God's Bible and Jesus to be the Virgin born son of God they're just beating their brains out instead of taking the light the baptism of the Holy Ghost and dashing on to Victory and power and overcoming they're only beating their heads out God's church will remain forever Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it when Peter made his great confession Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God he said blessed art thou Peter for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you he never never learned it in a seminary he never learned it from what somebody else said but my Father which is in heaven has revealed it to you and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell should not Prevail against it it showed the gates of hell would be against it but could not Prevail for the Church of the Living God shall move on oh great Church of God who stands sprinkled today with his blood amen amen now I wanted to speak a little bit about uh the the name of our church Jericho and a little bit of how it came to to be Jericho the city uh dates back to 8,000 BCE what year uh 8,000 before Christ it's known as the oldest city in the world if you Google the lowest city in the world in elevation it's Jericho sitting 258 M or 846 ft below sea level near the Dead Sea which is the lowest point on Earth sitting at 1300t below sea level now we know Jesus came for the poor he came for the Brokenhearted he came for the Sinners that's the lowest of the low in class now if there's no no uh spiritual connection there with the Jericho I think you better open your eyes there's meaning behind the name of our church and uh as well as uh the Harlot Rahab has spiritual meaning too as we know she lived in Jericho and Joshua the warrior had sent his scouts out um and Jericho's rulers tried to apprehend them during scouting the land there in the city of Jericho and Rahab hid them in her house and helped them escape and return of her safety and her families that they would spare her life and her families and uh as you know uh uh here as well in in in our house here of Jericho Tabernacle it's a Dwelling Place of Escape for us where we can Worship the Lord for the sake of our Salvation a place where we can hide it's the same thing that happened there in with Rahab she she lived in Jericho you know and then as we know our co-founder brother Johnny Alvar which is sleeping in Christ and waiting to rise you know uh um the the the way our church came to be was uh our formal Church uh had made a a mistake and uh brother Johnny was uh put out of the church unjustly As We Know and and us as a people we stuck with the brother it took love and unity each and every one of you that came from that church you you you made a sacrifice too with him you know and and uh uh it takes the same thing for us to to make it home still we all need to stick together don't let anything change cuz that's what the devil wants he'd love to see division but he's not going to get it cuz we're the bride of Christ the people that will be raptured one glorious day now let me let me uh share the scripture that we uh we held faith F to with brother Johnny it's found in First Corinthians 12 verse 25- 27 we'll read that there should be no Schism in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honored all the members Rejoice with it now you are the body of Christ and members in particular particular amen amen so we suffered with our precious brother we were able to discern right from wrong that's a unique special people that's the people we are still today that's the people that it'll take until we get home we need to remember that all that love and and and all that Unity that we have it needs to remain we need to continue fighting keeping our eyes on Calvary any new members that come into the church we're trying to have them be born again so that they can have their salvation so that we can all go home spend eternity together thank you Lord thank you now uh many times we may think that that this wasn't God's program in the way this church came to be but that is false and I I'll share with you why so every surrendered Soul that's come to this altar here every child every every baptism every married couple in this church every child presentation every new member and everyone's spiritual growth in this church has not been in vain but for the Lord's Glory that could never be taken back that was God's program you see where your brother stands today I believe I couldn't have accomplished where I'm at spiritually without this church without brother Johnny's suffering without us looking for this church I wouldn't be standing where I'm at spiritually with God I had stage fright nervousness I didn't even like to be around people but in this very spot here I surrendered to the Lord I became a prisoner of God I told Jesus Christ here I am Emmanuel prayed for me I walked back drunk off the Holy Spirit as I've explained before and now I just ain't the same no more now that can happen to you if you think you don't have the Holy Ghost I believe he's here today I believe he's here to bless you believest thou this he can restore anyone that needs anything from him believest thou this he's alive he's the same yesterday today and forever he doesn't come out of his program we leave his program don't look at the messenger look at the message when you begin to look at men is when you begin to fail don't look at the gift look at The Giver of the gift Jesus Christ is here to bless you Jesus Christ is here to restore the joy of your salvation man can't do nothing for you I can't give you anything there's nothing good in me I will fail my words will fail but Jesus Christ won't fail he laid the foundation already it's our duty to keep up with him to keep looking towards Calvary not let the devil step in we need to secure our camp love one another like if you were going home tomorrow because the minute you get a bitterness towards your brother you don't know if your heart attack can hit you there you can go home and not make it home God doesn't allow sinners in his kingdom we can't we can't go home after we've done something bad we won't make it we need to love all our Brethren put aside all indifferences any gossip that you hear you know what brother Johnny would have said that's garbage you throw that out the church continue forward love Jesus with all your heart he's here to give you the Holy Ghost if you have need not man man can't do that for you the word corrects the man it's not man it's the word that is what brings us where we're at that is what brings courage into the man when he steps into Christ when that light comes into man he's no longer the same he can talk before the crowd he can let them know that he has found Christ and that he's done with the world there's nothing good for us out there as I said before you turn back you may turn into that pillar of salt like Lot's wife Jesus Christ loves you he's always loved you it pleased God to to rip his son apart for you so that you would have salvation send back the Holy Ghost for us so that we can have joy so that we can have salvation for that way of Escape for he's the fairest of 10,000 Alpha and Omega alega the beginning and the end the first and the last for there's no one like him that light of God is here take it hold on to it he's here to bless you whatever you need whatever you're dealing with he's here he's here for you and I we need to take it embrace it run with it to Calvary he's here with us let us be let us be closing um let us
