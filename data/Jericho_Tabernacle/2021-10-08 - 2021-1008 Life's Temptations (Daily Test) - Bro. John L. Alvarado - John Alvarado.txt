of all [Music] i'm a little nervous it's the first time i've stand behind a pulpit like this to speak a little bit and um let's go and let's go into a prayer as we start lord without you we're nothing father father lord we place ourselves into your hands lord like we always do lord jesus asking you to take me out of out of the way lord jesus to talk to these people a little bit lord lord jesus we ask for this in the precious name of the lord jesus christ i'm going to go straight very very simple tonight just let's go to matthew as we're standing matthew 26 41. if you can open your bibles there to matthew 26 41 and it reads says watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak 222 capital and i forgot my classes i'm sorry i'm getting older i want this i want this the youth to hear this scripture uh flee also youthful lust but follow righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart but foolish and unlearned questions avoid knowing that they do gender strifes one more scripture before we sit down matthew 6 19. and i really like this scripture because uh brother odonius um brought a a message on it amen and it reads this after this manner therefore pray ye our father which are in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this our daily bread and forgive us our depths as we forgive our depthers and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen i want to just give a few small testimonies of uh that uh that i have that's that's happened in my life and um i want to start off you guys know i'm the oldest child of brother john g alvarez and my mother guadalupe alvarez [Music] um i i grew up in a christian home yo chris christiano i believe since the day i was born examples of i believe i was i'll start when i was young and i was maybe i believe my mom might correct me but uh after uh i was about five years old i was seven years old and uh i fell off the high chair the common question which is kind of a bad sign you know that was saturday night and then sunday sunday morning my mom would go to the to the to the gift room and she would go every sunday morning and they'd pray and she was at her you know and her post of duty i believe and my dad stayed back with the kids and he uh he people uh he took me he picked me up tried to take me to take me to church and i wouldn't respond i was i believe i was unconscious so they took they rushed my dad took us and took me to the church and my mom was just coming out of the gift room or they called her out or don't remember and um she she found out that her son was i was literally dying at five years old they thought i was dying they rushed me to the hospital uh and they um they find out that i had a cut not a cut it was a scratch on my brain which would cause brain damage sorry i probably shouldn't be normal maybe i'm not normal but thank god you know i'm here um and so starting at that at that point at a young age i i i didn't know at that time there was there was someone already calling on on the lord's name so i really believe that from there that was one of my testimonies that the day has come says that i can speak it that it's from when i was a little boy obviously my mother told me because i don't remember much of it but i i do know that the doctors gave me a medication so i believe my dad was always out ministering i believe they were going to colorado and they went on the trip and my mom and dad uh they were on the trip and like i think it was like two weeks that they went out and when they came back they realized that my mom had forgot that the medic medication i ran out of the medication s she went to to ask the doctor again for if to give me the medication the doctor says don't give it to him he's healed he doesn't need that anymore so i've had and obviously everybody has gone through trials in their lives even from young we don't sometimes we may not remember but those are trials that our parents go through you know you guys probably some of you guys know that uh i'll tell you a little story a little testimony um testimonial that i uh i love to play basketball even if i'm a big guy you know i'm you mean kantara i mean contact and sometimes they get a little rough you know um and um i guess god uh roughed me up one time and he i almost they poked my hour my eye out they took me out literally almost took it out cassie literally and um when did the the hospital emergency fuel hospital god save my eye dio salvojo um i should be i don't want to say the word but you know blind you name it you know that's what i should be no quiero de sierras so i grew up in a christian home like like i said and uh you know always went to church i do i do thank god for for always protecting me from and that's going to kind of take me a little bit into what i just want to speak a little bit yes um into what i want to say tonight just a little bit about trials and temptations so um actually i'm going to tell you a little story first that i heard the other day [Music] the testimonies that i had when i was a younger boy kind of relate to this to this story i heard it was a pastor that was on a plane and he was reading his bible the person next to him told him that he didn't believe in god and then uh the the guy next to him they they uh you know they had a conversation that he did not believe in god and the pastor was like thought in his mind so the pastor start praying and start saying well lord you know i don't know what to tell him anymore you know their conversation kind of ended and uh they were gonna about to land into chicago established and there was a tremendous turbulence on the plane and the same guy that said that he didn't believe in god and the pastor turned around and looked at him and smirked at him the plane was still shaking yes and then uh the the they land after very strong turbulence and obviously the pastor said that that was his chance to ask him do you believe in god now so that was just a little a little and and that kind of brings me into how people call on the lord in in in desperate times only seems like it is and i don't remember who came knocking to the door my mom was sick give me one more inferma my wife i think called me and i ran out of the shower and ran and i screamed i remember screaming to god in desperation and i don't think it should be like that until we're to a desperate you know a desperate situation i believe that that we need to uh be pure in heart and call on the on the lord's name all the time so that that's what i want to speak about tonight a little bit is to call on the lord's name and so um i want i want to i want to go a little bit it might sound like i'm changing a little bit of of my thought but i'm not scared um so it says uh in every temptation we need to call on jesus name jesus so temptation i read a little bit and looked in the dictionary of what they say temptation is and it says temptation is a desire to engage in a short-term urges [Music] i want to say that again and see if if you guys listen to what what they're saying here the temptation is dictionary it says temptation is a desire to engage in a short for enjoyment right and that it threat it threatens long-term goals so temptations they're like small last temptations little short term short term so muy pequenos corto plazo and they have they threaten the longer goal that we have and some of the other definitions that uh that i that i read i'm going to read them this temptation is the desire to do something especially something wrong or unwise and word similar to temptation is desire urge itch or impulse this synonymous all this is mostly stuff that i found on the dictionary so i wanted to kind of see what what out in the world what they describe of what that is temptation right now i want i want to go here to what brother branham says i look at the cinema just a little bit if you if you're patient with me here um um i took these out of some quotes of now we heard what um what they believe temptation is estos and i have i have to agree to some of them because it's it's you know it explains to me a lot but i do want to i do want to read these quotes that i read and i'm going to read it from the deity of jesus christ if you're patient with me please and i didn't have a chance to put it up there and this is this is what we we really want to pay attention to is the word of god and and have in mind of what we're trying to i'm trying to explain is the temptation but that is the god the creator living in you and giving you all the powers and you're in possession of anything that he had so is it in you to abstain from evil so it in so in you to abstain from evil to do good to shun evil and to flee to righteousness to turn away from temptation malice hatred strife envy and so forth turn away from it for that'll take him from your heart if you will receive him embrace him and love him and hold him in your heart and love him i can tell you church together in that kind of power has the power to bind the heavens heal the sick open the eyes why it's recognizing the power of almighty god in your heart there he is in deity amen that that to me you know it's it's the word of god so i really can't i'm not here i can't add anything else yes yes um so be patient with me please thank you for i [Music] you know none of us have a a message right all we have to do is repeat what he says is there's nothing nothing nothing else to to to add here's another quote that i liked uh as i read and i studied a little bit it says i said oh yes you can be you you can be temptation but his oh yes you can be temptation existed but his grace is sufficient that's right i see his grace is sufficient it's strange how smart men can sometimes get off track isn't it yes i heard a man preaching one of the most brilliant preachers pretty near compare with brother baxter [Music] similar in comparison now you see what i think of brother baxter i think he's a real preacher i believe you'll agree with me that's right so this i want to read a little a little bit lower where it says and he got on on the villain he said sickness is of god this is what brother branham says it's a look at this he said no matter what what we do important when you have arthritis arthritis rheumatitis and things say i love your arthritis or so forth and the lord give it to me you see you know the reason i read this because sometimes it seems like brother branham was like you don't understand it and and even to you know you're tempted to me i'm tempted to like question right sometimes that's why i read this this this quote here that that's wrong because the only the only sin there is is unbelief i can stand here and be and to be sincere with you that i've had a point where i doubted the word of god you know growing up as a as a message believer in my whole life is here our doubt our human person the flesh is is temptation i hope i don't lose you guys this is this i'm preaching to myself i think that's why i'm i'm up here but uh i'm going to read you another few more quotes and um this is now we have we have not got it in full this now and this this is where i like yesterday but jesus will help us in every temptation and now when i do wrong i'm ready to repent and he says anyone else is that wants to live right with god you don't desire to do wrong expera if i confess my wrong si yo confias gods just to forgive me and the same thing is when you when you got sick it's no sign you're immune from sickness but every time god is willing to deliver you from that sickness every time that you get sick you go to god and ask him every time he's willing to deliver you because there is an atonement it's upon your faith in that atonement which is your redemption and if we know that this joy that we have just been the earnest money on what lays ahead is what will it be when we draw the full benefit of the policy beneficial completed how many believe that it's it's the word of god i'm not i don't want to add anything i'm just reading from what brother branham has brought him um it's just something that that's been on my heart about how the youth is here and i know it's a youth service how how the youth are tempted um in in many many ways the differences even as we're old sometimes i'm tempted to run people off the road you know get mad you he said that temptation is not sin no especially but to heed to temptation is sin so it sounds like it's he's like saying it contrary but what he's saying is we live in the in the flesh and every day as long as we're alive we have to live in the flesh and trials and temptations um we have to call in the name of the lord jesus christ no matter what you know no matter what what what's facing us um we have to take everything in the name of the lord jesus christ there is no other name above his name um his mercy and grace is sufficient for everything recorded um let me read one more quote and i won't take much much longer on this one in the true easter seal no more this is when satan took jesus up to the top of the mountain for temptation jesus he showed him all the kingdoms of the world now that was all that was and all that would be here and all the kingdoms of the world and he said these are mine and they're still his young you know i don't want to add it's just that's what what i see and he says i can make them fight. i can make them do this or anything and he claimed the kingdoms of the world reclaimed so then we can see how green and selfishness comes into politics we can see then where it is in the church and the church leaders now watch that same old greed that started in the garden in eden that put a bad sail on one and the right sail on on the other so come right down into the times of our lord jesus here on earth he was given a trial by what was called justice a court of justice they're looking for your mother there wasn't one thing that they could find against him that was the political side of politico they couldn't find nothing against him even so much as pilate himself says i find no fault in him and then it comes to the church to cooperate with that same spirit that was in the church that was in politics to show that if satan lost his battle here he still had something in reserve he could fall right back to the church and they crucified him no amen amen and i'm talking to myself um i want to take everything in in the in the name of the lord jesus christ every step of my life every every minute of my life let's let's put everything in god's hands [Music] everything that we go through as personally as a church as friends and families como amigos familia everything we do let's take it in the name of the lord jesus christ are you please stand i'm i'm finished this is so just just to summarize a little bit of the little thought that i had was you know we have trials and temptations yes your name is holy lord jesus you're the only one lord jesus that we can run to it every day are our trials and temptations but lord you be there lord as we call on you to help us lord your blood is sufficient lord jesus lord i place these people here in your hands lord jesus like they are always simple and i pray lord that we call on your holy name lord jesus because we don't call on any other and it's the name of the lord jesus christ so we pray lord did you help me lord jesus christ you helped my brothers and my sisters hermanos have we call on your name constantly lord okay lord jesus i know you're coming soon amen amen thank you for being patient with me and god bless [Music] [Music] you may be seated [Music] my heart is [Music] i've opened all the windows [Music] come inside [Music] lord my heart is open [Music] won't you come inside [Music] i've of all the windows [Music] come [Music] one more time [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] come inside [Music] [Music] think about it think about [Music] as high is the heavens above so great is [Music] is [Music] [Music] let's sing one more time [Music] think about his grace [Music] for as high as the heavens above so great is [Music] [Music] hey [Music] [Music] [Music] oh
