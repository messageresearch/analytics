[33:25] sight of almighty God and in the
[33:27] presence of family and of
[33:37] friends to join together this man and
[33:40] this woman in holy
[33:45] matrimony which is commanded of St Paul
[33:48] to be an honorable
[33:53] estate instituted of God and therefore
[33:56] is not to be be entered into unadvisedly
[33:59] or
[34:07] carelessly but reverently and joyfully
[34:10] in the love of
[34:14] God into this holy estate these two
[34:18] persons present present come to be

[34:28] question who gives this bride to this
[34:55] GR
[35:11] very well if you'd all be so kind as to
[35:14] Bow your heads that we could enter into
[35:15] a word of
[35:20] prayer Lord gracious Heavenly
[35:25] Father we thank thank you
[35:28] Lord for this beautiful
[35:32] occasion that you have allowed
[35:36] today for there to be this wonderful
[35:38] wedding ceremony
[35:42] father to be done according to how you
[35:45] have instituted
[35:49] Lord that this amazing couple has chosen
[35:51] to take that path
[35:55] forward
[35:57] we place this ceremony into thy
[36:02] hands that you would bless it
[36:05] father and bless them
[36:08] Father we ask you this in the precious
[36:10] name above all
[36:14] names that is the name of our Lord and
[36:17] Savior Jesus
[36:21] Christ amen amen you may all be
[36:25] seated
[36:28] you look beautiful
[36:30] today look real
[36:34] handsome uh for those that don't know
[36:36] this is my little
[36:40] sister and he's been my brother since
[36:45] before and now he'll be my
[36:48] brother I want to
[36:50] read from the book of Mark chapter
[36:54] 10 and I want to read verse 6 to verse
[37:00] 9 and it
[37:02] reads but from the beginning of the
[37:04] creation God made them male and
[37:11] female for this cause shall a man leave
[37:14] his father and mother and cleave to his
[37:22] wife and they twain shall be one flesh
[37:26] so then they are not no more Twain but
[37:29] one
[37:35] flesh what therefore God hath joined
[37:39] together let no man put us
[37:44] under God bless the reading of his
[37:48] word god is so perfect in all that he
[37:54] does from the beginning of the creation
[37:56] creation of
[37:59] man God created man and
[38:02] woman and no matter how perverse the
[38:04] world has gotten
[38:09] today nothing can change what God has
[38:15] instituted he created man and woman in
[38:18] the
[38:20] beginning he created Adam and Eve in the
[38:25] beginning there are our first
[38:28] marriage they are our first
[38:31] example they are our first Redemption
[38:36] story of a man a man who loved his wife
[38:40] so
[38:43] much that he would literally give his
[38:46] life for
[38:48] her something that we're all trusting
[38:50] our brother Peter has had in his heart
[38:52] for a long time
[38:55] now
[38:57] and as we know as the years went on with
[39:03] Humanity the the the almighty groom
[39:07] came the almighty head
[39:11] came the almighty husband
[39:14] came and that is our Lord and Savior
[39:17] Jesus
[39:19] Christ and that groom he died on the
[39:22] cross for each and every one of
[39:25] us
[39:27] and who is the US that we talk
[39:31] about he died for his
[39:35] bride his bride that he loved so
[39:39] much he loved her so much he took on her
[39:45] blame he loved her so much he carried
[39:49] out his
[39:50] sins he took the responsibility of her
[39:55] faults and placed them upon his
[39:58] shoulders all the qualities of a great
[40:01] man a great
[40:05] husband Jesus Christ came to display the
[40:08] perfect ACT of
[40:12] love he played out the ultimate Love
[40:17] Story the greatest love story in the
[40:19] history of the human
[40:22] race because what awaits us one day
[40:27] is a wedding like this wedding that
[40:30] we're having here
[40:32] today what waits for us that
[40:35] day is a marriage like
[40:38] today with a feast and a great
[40:43] celebration like the celebration we're
[40:45] going to partake in a few
[40:49] hours of a beautiful and wonderful
[40:52] wedding that God has put before
[40:55] us
[40:58] that wedding is the marriage of Jesus
[41:00] Christ and his
[41:04] bride just as our sister Danielle has
[41:07] been getting herself
[41:09] ready and I don't believe she has just
[41:12] started getting herself ready a few
[41:13] months
[41:17] ago but she'd been getting ready for a
[41:20] long time
[41:22] now because she's been waiting for that
[41:25] promise
[41:28] and then when God
[41:30] answered she had to get her her her
[41:32] Affairs in
[41:35] order she had to get her
[41:38] dress a beautiful dress as
[41:41] this with no spot and no
[41:44] wrinkles because that will be us one
[41:47] day his bride on a glorious day like
[41:52] this where we can take his
[41:55] name
[41:57] and take the throne next to our
[42:00] groom so as I said if anyone doesn't
[42:03] know by
[42:05] now this is my younger
[42:08] sister that's why I get so
[42:11] emotional and you know I I remember the
[42:13] phases of life with
[42:17] her all the things that I
[42:20] saw how I embraced
[42:25] her
[42:26] how I loved
[42:28] her and through those
[42:31] phases uh we just entered into another
[42:36] phase where now she's a
[42:39] woman and she's been a woman for a long
[42:43] time but maybe she's just now becoming a
[42:46] woman to
[42:48] me but she's been an adult for a long
[42:52] time and now she's going to be a wife
[43:05] congratulations the Bible
[43:08] says as we read a man shall leave his
[43:11] father in his
[43:14] mother and cleave to his
[43:17] wife and on the other way
[43:21] around the woman will leave father and
[43:25] mother and cleave to her
[43:28] husband now I can't go into all the
[43:33] details uh of this beautiful love story
[43:35] between Peter and
[43:39] Danielle but I encourage you from this
[43:42] day
[43:44] forward get to know these
[43:48] two invite them
[43:50] over have them invite you
[43:53] over and have some fellowship with them
[43:55] and get to know that beautiful
[44:01] story it had so many pivotal
[44:04] moments so many confirmations from God
[44:07] one after the
[44:10] other and I believe if you're here
[44:14] today in part of those
[44:18] confirmations I believe most of you are
[44:20] inside of those
[44:24] confirmations and I can see
[44:27] now how Peter and
[44:30] Danielle they had to stay
[44:32] home the way circumstances in their life
[44:35] made them stay
[44:39] home they had to tend to their
[44:43] parents and and as we could use the
[44:45] Expression they never were able to leave
[44:47] the
[44:51] nest until God made the shift in the
[44:54] Stars
[44:56] to pull this young girl from California
[44:59] out to
[45:02] Arizona God had to make another shift in
[45:04] the
[45:07] stars to pull this almost young man from
[45:11] the darkness of the
[45:16] world we have a good
[45:20] relationship but nonetheless to pull a
[45:22] man like this from the darkness of the
[45:25] world
[45:30] and bring him into the light of the
[45:34] gospel God is so
[45:37] mysterious he brought two
[45:39] men to make them so
[45:42] close as if they were
[45:45] brothers only to use
[45:48] them to paint the bigger
[45:52] picture to bring those two families
[45:57] of those two
[45:59] friends and bring them
[46:01] together through one's
[46:05] brother and through the sister of
[46:08] another to officially make these two
[46:13] families into one larger
[46:17] family so today Peter Rodriguez and
[46:20] Danielle
[46:21] Santana rodri Sana or as my father has
[46:25] been joking for the last few
[46:30] months Rodriguez Mrs Rodriguez today our
[46:34] precious brother
[46:37] Peter and our precious sister
[46:41] Danielle have come to no longer be
[46:45] Twain but to be one
[46:48] flesh for the woman came out of
[46:52] man therefore she is a part of the man
[46:56] and together with
[46:59] Christ at the
[47:00] center they are
[47:02] one and for all of us
[47:06] here both family and
[47:10] friends we're here as
[47:12] Witnesses and as
[47:15] advocates that through our presence
[47:17] being
[47:20] made the actions we extend towards this
[47:24] couple
[47:26] and the prayers we've extended towards
[47:28] this
[47:31] couple we say Amen to the word of
[47:35] God that what therefore God hath joined
