[34:23] you may be seated
[34:30] i give thanks this evening
[34:59] i'd like for you to see this picture
[35:00] here nosotros
[35:06] we all know it
[35:08] the basis for what we're going to speak
[35:09] on and i hope to finish
[35:11] alma
[35:13] the soul
[35:14] spirit
[35:55] he said what scriptures are you going to
[35:56] take he
[35:57] and i gave it to him
[35:59] he said those are a lot
[36:02] i said well
[36:04] so they can have some homework
[36:08] i was telling her brothers
[36:32] so maybe i will bore you because i'm
[36:33] going to give you my scriptures but will
[36:35] you be able to take it
[36:52] or we go with the lord amen amen
[36:56] because on the contrary
[36:58] if god just dwelled there
[37:01] then you wouldn't have any problems yes
[37:03] is that right
[37:06] don't be scared
[37:19] the word of god amen amen
[37:35] and turn to the book of first
[37:36] corinthians
[38:02] is
[38:05] 47
[38:07] first corinthians 15 47 reads the first
[38:09] man is of the earth
[38:11] earthly and the second man is the lord
[38:13] from heaven
[38:26] as is the earthy such are also those
[38:28] that are earthy as is the heavenly such
[38:31] are they also that are heavenly
[38:34] as the earthly as yes
[38:38] fleshly earth celestial but the heavenly
[38:41] ferente is different
[38:44] so there's two right 49.
[38:56] and as we have borne the image of the
[38:57] earthly we shall also bear the image of
[39:00] the heavenly
[39:03] primera
[39:06] first corinthians 2 4.
[39:36] [Music]
[39:38] modern bible says
[40:13] first corinthians 2 14 but the but the
[40:16] natural man receiveth not the things of
[40:18] the spirit of god for they are foolish
[40:20] unto him neither can he know them
[40:22] because they are spiritually discerned
[40:29] but the animal man it words us as
[40:31] animals
[40:32] that's why i asked him to read it
[40:35] and here it says the natural man
[40:38] but in my bible it says otherwise
[40:42] the last scripture john 3 5.
[40:45] they say
[40:47] responding
[40:59] jesus answered verily verily i say unto
[41:01] thee except a man be born of water and
[41:03] of the spirit he cannot enter the
[41:05] kingdom of god
[41:07] you may be seated
[41:12] what we're going to speak on
[41:14] is something
[41:17] that no one can give you
[41:59] we see all the nations of the world
[42:28] like homosexuality
[42:32] and all types of deprived things
[42:34] [Music]
[42:36] but those that know the word of god
[42:40] we know they won't be able to do it
[42:56] and it doesn't work for them
[42:59] and all that won't stop evil
[43:03] because we're at the end time
[43:08] will come and take his children
[44:21] the temperature elevates
[44:23] the air we breathe
[44:24] it's contaminated
[44:27] earthquakes all over
[44:28] hurricanes temperatures
[44:31] these extreme
[44:33] and all types of things
[44:49] but how is the humans condition the
[44:51] human being's condition today
[44:53] presently
[44:56] kill and kill and kill mujeres
[44:58] women are raped
[45:01] children disappearing
[45:14] and all types of other things
[45:43] a solution to their problems
[45:48] and corruption
[45:51] and mainly juventus
[46:25] 24-32
[46:39] why does god do this it is and it says
[46:43] where for god
[46:46] gave them up to uncleanliness
[46:51] of their hearts
[47:22] of their
[47:29] to dishonor their own bodies between
[47:31] themselves
[47:50] who changed
[48:03] amen amen
[48:32] they changed their natural effects their
[48:33] natural use
[48:37] and likewise
[48:39] also the men the han
[48:42] leaving the natural use of the woman
[48:45] burned
[49:00] and
[49:15] and even as they did not like to retain
[49:17] god in their knowledge
[49:19] they didn't care about anything
[49:22] they didn't retain god
[49:27] god gave them over
[49:42] with all unrighteousness
[49:45] they were fed up they were full of
[49:49] decay with what fornication fornication
[49:53] wickedness
[49:55] covetousness
[49:56] maliciousness
[51:20] are worthy
[51:29] have pleasure in them that do them
[51:35] hey come here man let's go check out
[51:36] that woman
[51:38] they they have pleasure in doing it with
[51:40] them that also do it
[51:43] can you notice
[51:46] what condition the world is in presently
[52:02] you've
[52:07] [Music]
[53:26] in
[53:53] and everything that makes up this planet
[53:55] earth
[53:58] when he finished creating it
[54:00] everything
[54:02] everything was perfect
[54:05] there was no climate weather change
[54:08] no via
[55:03] [Music]
[55:09] so god created man in his own image in
[55:10] the image of god created him male and
[55:12] female created he them
[55:15] god is a spirit
[55:18] and he created another like him amen
[55:20] amen
[55:26] and god bless you
[55:28] and said unto them
[55:30] be fruitful
[55:32] and multiply
[55:47] thing that moves upon the earth
[55:52] he gave them there a commission amen
[55:56] to replenish to multiply
[55:58] and replenish the earth
[56:13] just like god
[56:34] and the lord god commanded the man
[56:35] saying of every tree of the garden thou
[56:37] mayest freely eat
[56:39] but of the tree
[56:40] of the knowledge
[56:42] of good
[57:08] it's not good that the man should be
[57:09] alone
[57:38] there he performed a surgery
[57:41] he opened
[57:43] brought out a rib
[57:46] he stitched it up
[57:49] a perfect surgery
[57:51] he brought out una costilla
[57:55] he closed the flesh there back to its
[57:58] place
[58:02] and the rib which the lord got it taken
[58:03] from man
[58:05] you made a woman
[58:20] and flesh of my
[58:34] what was her name first
[58:37] woman
[58:39] because she came out of him
[58:42] was a byproduct of his
[59:29] there was no time
[59:58] the man had already
[1:00:13] and said unto him where art thou yes
[1:00:16] he said
[1:00:18] i heard thy voice
[1:00:19] in the garden
[1:00:21] i was afraid
[1:00:23] because i was naked
[1:00:25] and i hid myself
[1:00:40] can you imagine
[1:00:57] i heard your voice in the garden and i
[1:00:58] hid because i was naked
[1:01:03] who told thee
[1:01:06] was naked
[1:01:46] [Music]
[1:02:03] wherever
[1:02:18] and she
[1:03:00] he
[1:03:08] but he no longer asks the serpent
[1:03:12] and the lord god said unto the serpent
[1:03:56] after he judged them
[1:03:58] he cast him out of eden
[1:04:01] genesis 3 24.
[1:04:04] we're giving homework for the youth
[1:04:09] he drove out the man
[1:04:39] that one day
[1:04:40] they die
[1:04:44] so then what happened
[1:04:47] [Music]
[1:04:48] they started to multiply
[1:04:51] they replenish the earth
[1:04:54] and they think that that way
[1:04:59] that god wanted them to multiply no no
[1:05:02] no no
[1:05:06] because they did not multiply
[1:05:08] the way
[1:05:10] that god wants it
[1:05:18] they were born in sin but
[1:05:36] and now we're here to noah genesis says
[1:05:38] genesis 6.
[1:05:45] can you say soon genesis 16
[1:05:55] and it came to pass when men began to
[1:05:56] multiply the face of the earth
[1:05:59] and daughters were born into them
[1:06:02] these
[1:06:44] men
[1:06:46] that they were fair
[1:06:48] how were they
[1:06:51] they were beautiful
[1:07:07] and how they dressed
[1:07:40] and it is in the
[1:07:55] i said look
[1:07:57] who's that one
[1:07:59] she tells me of a little friend
[1:08:01] when she went to high school
[1:08:03] or middle school i knew her fair and she
[1:08:05] was ugly
[1:08:07] ugly
[1:08:22] now beautiful
[1:09:06] [Music]
[1:09:18] anywhere
[1:09:24] verse 3
[1:09:25] verse 3.
[1:09:26] and the lord said no
[1:09:30] my spirit shall not always strive with
[1:09:31] man
[1:09:32] for
[1:09:43] remember the first scriptures
[1:10:55] what
[1:11:39] what fault did the animals have
[1:11:41] he grabbed him all the same
[1:11:43] he destroyed everything i'm in amen
[1:12:06] the entire
[1:12:47] because noah's family benia came in
[1:12:54] and all that they produced
[1:12:57] was evil
[1:12:59] just like the other ones
[1:13:01] amen amen
