it before but this will be my full one I want to start with the scripture in John 14 25 in Juan Couture these things I have spoken unto you okay these uh isotros being yet present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and being all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you um please forgive me I'm a little nervous speaking up here uh I'd rather be way back there in the last few where I usually sites but this has been something in my heart that I want to share and I'll be happy if at least one person gets something small out of this and it's funny how when you want to do something for the lord the devil will do his best to throw as many punches at you as you can and believe me he's punched me a lot especially this last month I think it's been one of the hardest months I've had to go through I think he knew I was going to testify and the devil used every little thing yeah uh to get to me even up till right now but thank God I'm an overcomer and I'm here to testify yesterday for the honor and glory of the Lord I was born June 18 2003. to a single mother Desiree Sosa now Alvarado is and growing up we never really attended church my family was pentecostales and me and my mom would only attend a couple Sundays here and there is we were taught Jesus was born on Christmas Jesus and it was okay for women to have authority in the church and it was okay for them to wear pants and makeup and cut their hair is growing up the few Services we went to a year were very short Services only about an hour and 30 minutes at the most and I never had a true relationship with God growing up I would pray with my family for our food but that's about it a quick one minute prayer a couple times a week was the only time I would give God yes for years and sometimes I would hear about the Rapture yeah this is and I would get so scared because part of me news if it were to happen I wouldn't make it because I was not living right but now I can't wait for that glorious day I really hope I live to see it I yearn for it to happen why would I want to stay on this rotten Earth I grew up in the world and when I got to high school is when I did a lot of things from the world because that's all I knew I wish I could say everything I've done in the world to show how God has truly delivered me but I know it's best not to reveal things that are too deep I would wear ripped jeans and shorts on special occasions like my birthday I would wear makeup I would cut my hair I would listen and watch bad movies and songs I think to myself you know as a baby my ears were pierced so maybe right there my ears we're cut off to hearing of the word foreign I never felt bad for the worldly things I was doing so when my mom met Boaz Alvarado my whole life changed I think he really lives up to his name kinsman redeemer complex because he showed me and my mom this message I like to make this joke how my mom's Ruth and I'm Naomi the package that came along when I first met him I did not like him at all I really think our Spirits Clash because all he did was treat me with kindness but in return I would be so mean [Music] and I especially didn't like it when we had to go to church with him we went from hardly ever going to church to now going every Sunday and sometimes Friday my mom would have to force me to go and when she gave me a choice I would always choose to stay home but the times I would hate every second of it I would get there and be so mad because the music was so loud music and during the preaching I didn't understand anything because I never heard of the message and I never spoke Spanish so I would try to tune out the whole service or falling asleep and uh growing up I always hated to wear dresses and skirts I would prefer sweatpants and a shirt so going to church was something I'd dreaded to do because I had to put on a dress and it didn't help that I didn't know anybody so I would just stick with My Moment by this time I was already introduced to Boss family and whenever there was a church event I never wanted to socialize with anybody I would either stick with my mom or a Grace La Sabrina the boss because we are almost the same age and we started to get close closed captioning not available [Music] [Music] I'll never be like those people I'll never wear skirts or dresses or sing songs or be a part of church it's funny how things turn out when you say you'll never do something you end up doing it I love God for his sense of humor because look at what I'm doing right now testifying about his greatness but I do remember we're in service that I paid attention to fully uh it was at the church on McDowell McDowell and it was brother Johnny's sermon on love Johnny where he talked about the white dog and the black dog negro and that was the first sermon I remember thinking yes wow that's interesting so I believe right there this is that's where the seeded me got a Sprinkle of water Flash Forward to after covet happened and the church opened back up again I remember I was at the barbershop and brother Michael came in and he was saying how they're opening up youth nights again on Tuesdays and he asked me to attend when he asked when he asked me I did not want to go but I felt bad saying no to him so I reluctantly agreed to sing and brother Michael knows when I first met him I did not like him at all and I don't know why he was always nice maybe our spirit class he says but thankfully I apologize to Michael program and now I really look up to him and his wife and I love them so after I attended Tuesday night this was even though I was forced to go and when I went I did not want to talk to anybody which is funny because the people I never wanted to talk to are now some of my best friends it's great it's a great thing to have friends of like faith is I'm very thankful for them that week I attended Tuesday is I also attended Wednesday Friday and Sunday and for the first time I went on my own and actually paid attention and it felt kind of nice so I kept going and going after that Faith cometh by hearing and for the first time I started to listen more and more the seeds started to grow little by little because my attitude started to change towards the people of My Life um some of the people that know me now [Music] they tell me that I'm loud energetic kind of funny um uh nice but I used to be very mean stuck in my ways type of person um and as I attended church and started to hear and accept the word my heart began to softening he really will take that old Stony heart and give you a new one God has bust my life so much one of the things I always wanted as a kid Nina was to have a dad all my life I was without my head because the father is the head of the children maybe that's why I'm a little bit crazy because I was walking around headless for so long and I barely got my dad when I was 16. but in the Lord's perfect timing he gave it to me I can't understand why things happened the way they did but if things didn't happen that way I would have never heard of the message and I would still be doing those worldly things I used to do maybe even worse but God's plan is mysterious and rather trying to explain it I choose to believe it God is so good because I always wanted a father and he gave it to me but not only your father he gave me a great message believing family as well that I love very much and I thank God because it's one of the biggest blessings in my life with everything happening to me and me starting to change I decided I needed to get baptized because I heard brother Branham say you need to get baptized to enter the kingdom of God so I took that first step and on August 22nd yeah I got baptized uh now I never asked the Lord to change my life before I got baptized I would still wear pants outside of the church but when the Holy Ghost comes it makes you walk different talk differently think different be different dress different that's what the Lord did with me so that Wednesday after I got baptized on Sunday I went to church and the tape was the choosing of a bride is and when I was listening to the tape my ears and eyes were opened the Bible States in deuteronomyo 22 5. Cinco the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man neither shall a man put on a woman's garment for all that do so are an Abomination is I was taught growing up it's okay for women to wear pants and I've worn them my whole life at first I never understood why it was wrong but I never really asked or took the time to find out why it was wrong when I heard that a woman's hair is recovering I stopped cutting my hair and I only wore makeup on special occasions so it's easy to give that up but I struggled with wearing pants outside of the church but when I fully heard and learned why it is um I decided to stop the tape taught me many things and I wanted to apply it all to my life I heard brother Branham say the Modern Bride wears shorts wears pants cuts off her hair wears clothes that look like a man brother Branham also says Christ Ain't Gonna Take a Ride Like That hearing that made me not want to represent the Modern Bride I want to represent the true bride the brother Branham saw in his vision he said and coming this way was the lovely bunch of women with the cross of Jesus going on Jesus and as they pass by I stood there was something there yeah some Spirit was God and I said there is my bride that's the bread I want to representative brother Branham also says women I want you to look in the mirror and look at what God requires the women to do and see in God's mirror not in your church now it's in God's mirror and see if you could qualify in your life the spiritual bride of Jesus Christ I thought to myself how can I qualify to be the bride and firstly my appearance didn't match it after hearing these words of the prophet and the Bible I made a decision to throw away all my pants because I didn't want to be an Abomination I also went home and took all my decorations off my walls before my walls were filled with movies and posters with worldly music artists but when I heard brother Branham say if I go to a man's office and he says he's a Christian Cristiano Pinups all around the world that old Boogie Woogie music going on I don't care what he says I'm so I also gave up listening to worldly music and this is but the devil never stops trying to tempt me when I walk into a store oh I overhear music from someone else it seems like they always play the songs I used to love but these words stick with me every day every day I remind myself to represent God's word I can't say oh I'll wear skirts and dresses in church and going other places I'll wear pants brother Branham says that's what we try to do today in our textbooks is try to make the word which is Christ instead of us trying to make ourselves I have to make myself suit the word by representing it and dressing how the Bible tells me too the devil tried to throw a punch at me every child that comes to God must be tested and he tried because during that time I was working in fast food restaurants and I kept asking my boss if I could wear skirts to work because at first I would wear pants but then I had my Revolution and she would always come up with an excuse as to why I couldn't and I asked her a bunch of times but she just kept coming up with excuses so I made the decision to throw away all my pants and the devil throws his first punch at me by having me still wear them to work and I remember every time I put that only pair of jeans on I had I would apologize but by God's grace I was able to quit that job and finally throw away that last pair of jeans and from then on I haven't worn a pair of jeans since then God has helped me with so many things appearance and internally wise here are some small examples as well I would come to church and at first I was scared to raise my hands whenever I heard something that made me think amen amen the devil would whisper to me nobody else is raising their hands you're going to be the only one and you're going to embarrass yourself but now I'll define gravity like brother Branham says and I'll raise my hand to the word of God and I'll say Amen to it I used to have long painted fake nails because I bite my nails and I thought my hands looked nicer with acrylic painted nails but I heard brother Branham a husband coming home to his wife and he says how would you like to come home overnight for your Devotion to your wife and she's got a bunch of little children and you find that day you said yeah and when she comes in oh this is all her nails may be painted that is you are of the world so in my heart I did not want to look like any part of the world so I stopped painting my nails I also told myself I would never sing in church because I can't sing good and it's scary to get up here in front of everybody but I've done it several times already the Bible says Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord and uh last year at Camp is I had a really great experience with the Lord I've said this testimony before but I'll say it again because it's worth testifying about it twice before coming to camp and this is people would ask me if I was ready and I would say yes I'm coming with expectations because I had some things I was struggling with and I knew at Camp I would receive something and during Saturday's prayer line I felt the presence of the Lord really hard one of the ministers told me to open my heart fully to the Lord and he asked me what I wanted from the Lord and I told him some desires from my heart and he prayed for me and towards the end of the prayer he put his hands on my forehead and it was like he casted something out that I was struggling with and that's when I felt so light and liberated I fell back [Music] but I continued to walk through the line and a couple steps after falling my hands and arms started to shake really hard my arms felt so heavy I felt that they started to go down and the brothers were trying to hold them up I just felt like I was gonna fall on the floor again because I felt God's present presence very strongly walking to that line and at the end of the line I was guided to a chair and when I sat down I stopped shaking and I just covered my face with my hands and leaned over and I kept crying and praying and thanking the Lord my face and head felt super hot like fire on my head and after I calm down I felt so tired and drained like I couldn't get up so I just stayed there listening to the music worshiping God after the service I come from the world and there's no better feeling than the presence of God never in my life did I imagine I'd be here but by God's grace and mercy I'm here I've said this before but it's true it's like eating at McDonald's your whole life in McDonald's and then getting to eat at Longhorn Steakhouse restaurants why would I ever want to go back to McDonald's I was born 20 years ago but really only been living for two years and I thank God for these beautiful two years see Revelations and experiences and as my favorite song says just remember when you're standing in the valley of decisions and the adversary says our Lord will show up and he'll take you to the fire again I realized everything God has given me at first I've tried to push it away or ignore it because I I was a person who didn't like change I did it with the message my friends and family my parents but then I realized everything he does and sometimes the devil yeah Diablo can make it seem like he's not answering but like another one of my favorite songs says tell me a time he's not been faithful tell me a morning his mercies weren't new foreign in retrospector you're gonna find there's never a time and I have come to accept and love it and be so thankful for everything God has done and by God's grace he continues to bless me even though sometimes I first can't see it he still does I just have to keep continuing to trust his plan um I don't want to get to heaven and God tell me depart from me for I never knew you apart but I know he won't say that because I've had a true experience in relationship with Christ even now after all the experience I've gone through I can't even remember how all the books of the Bibles go I still need to look at that first page to tell me what page number the book is [Music] I still can't quote brother Branham or scripture from memory and the devil uses that against me but God reminds me and I've heard several sermons on how it's good to have intellectual knowledge is but if that's all you have it does you know I heard a preacher say I pray that I'm never the kind of believer they can pass the doctrinal exam but fail at the life but thank God for his saving grace and mercy records because I was on a terrible path and God picked me up and turn me around and I think about it a lot and it brings me to tears because of how I was living a very worldly life but thankfully now I can say I'm a Christian program I hope to be a big tree with lots of shade right now I'm just a small stick maybe one or two but I pray to God that I'll continue to walk down this straight narrow path for as long as I'm in this earth and trust me just because I'm a born-again Christianity it doesn't make it easy because I still struggle with a lot of things and as long as I'm in this flesh the devil will never stop trying I know I messed up I still sometimes get mad I get sad sometimes life would just tear me down the devil will continue to kick me when I'm down and he tries to make me stay down he does a really good job at that he'll tell me things like you go up to the altar too much that experience wasn't real it's experience why are you still getting mad if you have the Holy ghosts the devil can make those things get to me but I have to remember that the devil's just trying to take my eyes off Christ and make me doubt when things of Life start to get heavy yes and uh recently I've been studying the subject of love no not that filio kind but that real genuine Agape because I know I sometimes struggle with that showing love especially because I'm in this flesh and sometimes it can be easier yeah this is to love one brother versus that other brother but I want to and I'm praying to get to that point where I'm like Jesus where he knew Judas would betray him but still called him friend even with brother Branham you couldn't tell his enemy from his friends I know that I have to die to myself and my pride yourself when the devil tries to get me with why didn't they invite you there or oh they talk about you behind your back or they're not as good as friend as you thought they didn't even tell you happy birthday but I have to get over that fleshly thinking and just replace it with love I used to struggle a lot with being too prideful and I still do sometimes and it's hard to apologize to people I'm not very good at it but uh now I get corrected by the spirit of Christ and I go and apologize when I make things wrong I have to have love for everybody because we're going to spend eternity together and sometimes men will fail you yeah this is but there's one that will never fail me I'd rather have faith in doubt and have faith that one day I have a body change where the devil can't tempt me no more and I'll reign with my Lord in eternity forever so I'll continue on this path even after I Stumble I'll just get back up again and continue walking all the pain and suffering will be worth it because I love the Lord and if I have to do a little bit of suffering here on the Earth but the outcome is I get to go to heaven I'll take that little bit of suffering for an eternity of Peace like the woman says I'm not what I ought to be and I'm not what I want to be but I'm not what I used to be he he's going to have a bride that hasn't got a wrinkle in here amen amen she's wholly Washed by the blood yes of his own self de El mismo that's right I see yes so we see where we stand the wedding getting ready to come inside thank you thank you thank you a blessing it's the um now Mom when you were coming from a Catholic Church apostolica how did you become a Christian in coming into the Apostolic Church foreign I was born in a Christian Church my parents would scold me because I wouldn't go to the Catholic Church I would go to the Catholic church but I would always leave because I didn't want to hear what the father was saying I never believed he would say to my mom no more this is uh don't bother arminda yeah because she get it believes in just one God yes and that's her decision is and I always believe that there was only one God my father my mother believed in many gods I would go to the Catholic church and I would see the Saints I would start trembling and quivering I would see the Saints and I said he's going to fall on me he's going to kill me see foreign don't take her to church because she's not there with any kind of devotion she just laughs at the saints that are hanging up yeah and that's true I could see the Saints hanging on the walls and I would say oh they're going to follow me they're going to kill me I think it's better if I don't go to church I would go to the church but then I would go outside when my mom would go look for me yes I was already outside and she would say nothing's gonna happen to you just sit down and just stay there and so I would go out buy something I would go back in and eat eat in church foreign they would say you can't eat here but I would say I'm really hungry and I would keep eating in church my mom would make me get up and they would take me to the place where you do the sign of the cross and my mom would say she would put her hand on my forehead yeah and then I would rub my forehead I would take away that cross that she made yeah and she would say this is It's holy water it's really dirty because everyone puts their finger in there hmm what that father says that father foreign from my parents they would have Services drop s I would say Mom I'm going to the park to go play with the ball because I was in a team and we would play so I remember I would go but I was lying I wouldn't go to play I went to church I didn't go to church I was playing at the park what if I hit you just hit me I'm saying Peter when actually I was saying what I'm telling you is the truth my mom would say bye-bye to my dad she believes in those Holy Rollers she believes in that and we can't take that away from you because she believes not so many gods and I really didn't like that scene one day I turned to look at him I got the scissors and I cut off the string and he fell area then I jumped on him and I stomped and stopped until I fully broke it it does and then my mom came afterwards she said she said look at the same he did a miracle is she began to piece them together and I would just laugh yeah but I would say mom that Saint isn't worth anything she said just be quiet anything that I told you Mom is the truth and she would just laughs she wouldn't say anything and my father would say it's because there's only one God with you you believe in many gods I just believe in one true God with your Gods I'll continue with mine and then I guess yes that's fine I won't bother anymore I'll let you know what you're believing in um and how did you come to the Apostolic Church what was the medium there were some sisters that would go to the church yes and they would invite me and I would go Gutierrez she began to talk to me of the Gospel yes and that's how I began to go to the Apostolic Church what church and where was that church that you used to go to become Iglesias apostolica in the Apostolic Church there was a few people there you don't understand why I say Iglesia and what was that church it was in Juarez and they're in the city of Juarez hey yes and that's where we would go to the Apostolic Church there was a few people there is but the few that were there were such a great blessing such a great blessing who afterwards became the pastor of that church there was a brother there that would go his name was Nicolas Trejo you would go there to the Apostolic Church who built and founded that church some brothers there that were from El Paso that they were the ones that started the church from El Paso Texas they're they're the ones that started the church you and they would go visit there and they would preach them those brothers would see yeah and then afterwards it was a pastor his name was Thomas Santos he would give us God's word and there he stayed with us he would have preached to us and then afterwards Brothers started coming and coming and I don't think they really liked it because they would only last two Sundays and then they would leave but then they would pick up an offering and brother Amado would give the offering to the pastor foreign then they wouldn't come back they were just there for the interest for money to be offering I was always glorifying and praising his name is we're born in the truth they were all presented to the Lord and when I would go visit my mom and my dad did you baptize the children and says what churches you baptize them yeah and the one up there you need to take them to the father why would I take him to the father I would say mom you know I don't believe in such a father when I was little you would take me you would take me because you would pinch me I know you were because I wouldn't go very young but then I grew up and you stopped yeah thankfully mama at what age were you baptized in the Apostolic Church I don't recall s [Music] do you remember what year the brother Banner's message came to the episode in 1976 it was in 1969. who was the pastor back then when the message came brother Francisco facio Pastor he was the pastor mm-hmm any money from Brother Francisco fasi was a pastor and then he would preach to us he would preach really hard to us and then I would ask him brother so hard to us we're already in the words and he would say oh yeah but I said it's too hard and he said well that's how it is and some people left even my husband left and my husband left and he said I he said let's go to such and such church I said no this is my church he says no you have to be with me wherever I go they don't know and I said uh what business do I have in other churches if they don't keep the their word at that church and I would stay he would get upset but oh well one day he'll get happy about it yeah and he kept like that is the gospel that brother Brandon brought I felt very happy and it started to be in the palace and the word of the Lord Jesus Christ God bless you um my mom truly forgets about a lot of things and this
