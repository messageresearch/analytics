TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign nice to be here this morning and now i believe we're going to have a special brother williams is telling me by someone from his church like the woman at the well i was seeking for things that could not satisfy and then i heard my savior speaking draw from my well that never shall run [Music] fill my cup lord [Music] i lift it up lord come and question thirsting of my soul [Music] [Music] fill it up and make [Music] this world gave you that won't pass away my blessed lord will come and save you if you kneel to him and pray [Applause] fill my cup lord [Music] i lift it up lord come and quench this thirsting of my soul bread of heaven [Music] [Music] fill it up and make me [Music] that's what we're here for this morning raising up our cups philip lord yes lord this is the only time that we'll have the opportunity to ask this there'll come a time where we'll be on the other side and then we won't have that opportunity so while we do have it and in our right mind i think one of the most sensible things that anyone can do while god has given us the opportunity to do so is to do it get our cups filled now with his love and mercy there is one who sat with us long ago not too long ago neither and he's passed on and it's a great sorrow in our hearts for brother williams that's brother williams our chapter president here his father how was your father brother 88 88 that'd be about 18 years i guess a past the the uh no i've been uh yeah 18 years have passed the promised time a gallup man it hasn't been too long ago since setting in the meeting i said to him in no disregards to brother williams i said you look younger than your son carl it just goes to show that we're here today and tomorrow we're not here we don't know when that time comes when it is coming but we know it's coming i was thinking but life is a great thing it's life is an opportunity we just had a great tragedy of one that come to our church that's along from chicago was killed the other day coming home a mother she's supposed i guess close to 70 and she and her husband riding along and up kansas or missouri won a blizzard going through a man driving car out of control her neck was broke instantly and we just don't know when this is coming when i they called me to tell me about it and i called up all the children around across the nation telling them of course being their pastor like i was one to notify them uh thinking of how quick we can go and then there said a box of candy sitting before me that she made me about a week ago and gave to me just to see how quick we can be snapped out but if that this life only was where we had our hopes we'd be a miserable people job said in the 14th chapter all that thou would hide me in the grave and keep me in a secret place have you ever noticed how nature testifies of god we find the trees the leaves go off the trees and the life in the tree goes down into the ground like the grave and stays there until the wrath of the winter is past then it comes back again bringing forth new life it's a testimony that we live again the sun rises of the morning just a little baby it's weak after a while it's this time it's in school high school then at noon it's in its strength then the afternoon it begins to turn to the other side then in the evening it gets weak again and dies but that's not the end of the sun it comes up again the next morning to testify to another generation that there is a life death burial and resurrection [Applause] even nature everywhere speaks of him and nature is a great testimony in another way that is that we cannot have this resurrection life unless it serves god's purpose now if a seed is planted and that seed is germatized it brings forth a new flower but if it isn't germatized it will not bring forth a new flower if it doesn't serve god's purpose that i just because it's a flower it rises because it serves god's purpose that's the reason the sun rises because it serves god's purpose and we rise when we serve god's purpose i believe that brother williams served god's purpose in life a real father and i see his darling companion mrs williams sitting here a real husband that's one of god's purposes a father one of god's purposes and he was dramatized to god by the holy spirit god's main purpose so to say that brother williams will not rise and be with us again we'd have to say there's no there's no going down to the sap there's no rising of the sun everything speaks of his resurrection again to be with us again everything first the sun the flowers the nature botany life everything speaks of it and then the word of god speaks for him and besides that the very faith that's in our heart pulsates that we'll see him again god rest his soul just as a little salute to him that once sat with us let us stand to her feet just a moment [Applause] heavenly father we have never tried to make a gathering like this a purpose just to be seen or heard we have come together each time for the edification of thy son jesus christ and to give testimony to those who are without him that they might find him we are our hearts are burdened for those who are left behind from the departing of our brother one that sat with us not long ago is many times set right in this same chapter but we believe that you let him live out a good full round life and his soul is with you today rest him o god until that day when we shall see him again bless his son here his other children his darling wife those who love him that's all of us father may we take notice to this that we too are frail and we must go someday so let us prepare ourselves for that great hour and if there should be some here this morning who has not prepared for this same event may this be the day that they'll say yes to the lord jesus and also be dramatized to him by the holy spirit for we ask that in jesus name amen he's seated now we want to announce a few announcements my wife was sitting back there this morning i told her i said honey i'm gonna be out of the breakfast we had to go downtown do some things and i said i'm gonna be out at 10 o'clock she looked at me i said if i'm not out by 10 o'clock i'll buy you three new dresses of your choice so i i know what's going to happen i owe three dresses right now cause it's 20 to 10 now but i will try to hurry as quick as possible we're glad to be here jericho with you brother this morning and we invite you monday night up to jerusalem in tucson to at the banquet down there see phoenix is in the valley like jericho tucson where i live is on the mountain that's that's jerusalem where you at tony won't somebody say hey man around here now i'm in a trap tony didn't even show up well tomorrow or monday night is the banquet at um at tucson and we certainly would be glad if you're around that way or drop in and see us my subject that night at the lord willing is we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship him and uh now the 19th of this month uh or next month rather 19th of january i start a revival here right in this room the ramada in here and the 19th the 20th and 21st and then the 22nd i believe starts the 23rd i have four nights here and as a revival many you minister brothers we're certainly happy to have you with us this morning and we accordingly invite you out to bring your people uh the ones especially that you know you're in the city that doesn't know jesus as their savior and then secondarily to those who are sick and and believes that god answers prayer we aim to pray for the sick during this time just prior to the great national convention is to be held here beginning of 22nd and i'm sure you want to hear that because these many outstanding speakers come and i'm sure you have a great time now this morning i have thought about speaking here to this chapter which phoenix has always been a place on my heart i like phoenix i was sure when i was a little boy out here at wickenburg just above and lived down here at 16th and henshaw it was a desert then but i see it's right in the metropolitan well really in the heart of the city goes to show that there's a changing time changing but there's one thing i want to speak on this morning is the unchanging one that's god god in his program his word it never changes times change man's change systems change but god never changes he ever remains the same i thought being that we were facing the christmas time that we would maybe uh speak on a christmas message and now if you have your bibles and like to read sometimes people do behind uh evangelist or speaker i want to read from saint matthew's gospel the second chapter for a potion of the word now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judea in the days of herod the king behold there came wise men from the east to jerusalem saying where is he that's born king of the jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him when herod the king heard these things he was troubled in all jerusalem with him and when he had gathered all the chief priests and the scribes of the people together he demanded them where christ should be born they said unto him in bethlehem of judea for thus it is written by the prophets and thou bethlehem of the land of judah are not the least among the princes of judah but out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people israel may the lord add his blessings to the reading of his word and now with some notes here and some scriptures referred to i like to have your undivided attention for a little while on the subject of why little bethlehem you know at christmas i think we all too many of us i wouldn't say all but too many of us lose the real value of what christmas is as an artist out here even the palm trees are decorated and in the east it's always the fir tree or the evergreen and months or weeks rather maybe a month or six weeks before christmas ever begins it's always a tinsel and and a great they made it a commercial instead of what it really means i don't believe that christ is born on the 25th day of december i do not believe that at all it would be impossible for the things to happen the hills of judea are sore then while snow is way steep in there in the month of december up in judea but we realize and studying history uh christ was probably born in the spring along maybe april may somewhere like that but when it was changed this brought it when christianity was converted into romanism they made the sun god's birthday which was at the solar at the 25th from the 21st to the 25th of december the sun setting right almost hearty changes at all and then that was the sun god's birthday so they change it to the son of god but remember whatever what day it might be we still doesn't take away the sacredness of what is supposed to be where satan has robbed us of this has made the great commercial in santa claus stole all of the worship it's become a day like easter like uh bunny rabbits and pink ducks and and what's that got to do with easter once i got to the resurrection of christ it's just like the world today the kids on the street can tell you more about davey crockett than he could about jesus christ they can tell you more about some uh outlaw some criminal of days gone by than the can the prince of life that that was born uh 1900 years ago but that doesn't take the real thing away from we christians you see always light shines its best in the darkness the fork and lightning in the black cloudy skies at night shows there can be light and darkness and when the light is shining you don't see if the sun shining you don't need the lights too much but darker the smaller the light greater will shine in the darkness darker the better it shows itself better and that's more or less that we christians ought to be testifying to the glory of god giving his son to us this christmas ought to be an outstanding thing we christians are no matter how much it looks it'll make it shine that much better the whole world's got tinsel we've got christ and that's what we ought to be letting shine in this dark hour that we're now living in we think of how god does things in unusual ways because he is unusual himself god is unusual he's he's the supernatural the infinite until we finite so anything he does is in his scope unusual and god is so so great till he takes the unidentified things of the earth to identify himself by we notice here in my subject of why a little bethlehem that smallest of all of judea the princes of other cities of judea why did god choose to send his son to that place that's what we want to talk on god taking the things of the world i'll be the scripture says by the foolishness of preaching it please god to take the unidentified things what we make great god calls foolish what we put so much glory to god says it's it's it's no good and what we think is no good god glorifies it was thinking of just before the birth of our lord when all the prophets and so forth this spoke of the forerunner coming however a mountain would be brought low and the low places brought high and the mountains of skipped like little rams the leaves that clap their hands it was a a minister a prophet by the name of john came forth out of the wilderness not from even a theological school whiskers all over his face a piece of sheepskin not in a clergy clothes come out and announce the kingdom of god is at hand and the people could hardly understand such an outfit is that coming with no identification of any any system anything that he belonged to any fellowship card or any denomination that he was backing him up message was too great he couldn't take man god school him out in the wilderness his message was not on some kind of a theological terms he spoke of serpents and axes and trees and that's what he was used to nature watching it how it worked and that was the way he approached not as a clergyman but as as a man of nature and uh the people clearly understand he didn't even have a pulpit probably wasn't welcoming any but he preached on the banks of the yard and probably standing in mud up half to his knees but the people come out to hear it those who were honest in heart they wanted to hear because it was something different it had a ring of truth to it today we ought to be it just at the approaching of the birth of christ our message you'd ought to have a ring of truth to it that would make people thirst to finding god took that simple man without education not one day in school and yet said he was the greatest among all the prophets that ever lived because god identifies himself in unidentified things when jesus chose his disciples it was there were many man better qualified for the job than those disciples they were clergymen you never call one they were clergymen in them days great man priest man of education renowned man but he never called him he took fishermen and tax collectors and so forth to send his message out he always does it in the days of noah he chose a farmer just a common farmer to announce the destruction of that age just a common farmer not a clergyman just a farmer in the days of noah he took a apartment in the days of moses he took a runaway slave not a clergyman and he let him get out till he was satisfied out in the backside of the desert and lose his education and appeared to him in a burning bush and sent him down with a crooked stick in his hand to take over a nation that hit run from see god takes the simple things to identify himself through see taken is just his word he made the world out of the things that it does has not appeared a few days ago i was at the mars auditorium one of our great new york campaigns and i was hearing a lecture on einstein speaking of this galaxy that said take a hundred and fifty million years of light time to go out to it in 150 million years to get back and then just think 150 million light years that would be 300 million light years and then when you got back here you'd only been gone 50 years i think my fast light travels later 86 000 miles per minute and think of how many billions and trillions of years it would take to go out there and come back a hundred and twenty three hundred million light years and that's just to a galaxy in the constellation the god just blew from his hands and he may be eons of time in light years beyond that and they're looking down upon that then this a russian said that he's about 150 200 miles up in the air said he never seen no god or angels how simple can man get it and then think of all them billions and trillions of years and only 50 years from here what did you do broke into eternity they say this astronaut that just went up was up so many hours went so many 17 times around the world or whatever it was they said every it wasn't one second in his life he was traveling with the time so i see you break into eternity that's the greatness of god some our minds cannot fathom how great he is and yet when he gets ready to reveal himself he makes it so simple takes the simple things to do it the simplicity david you seem to be the uh all of jesse's seven sons he was the last one to be brought before the prophet while even his own folks could laugh they couldn't imagine a little ruddy looking david a little stoop-shouldered ruddy-looking man to be the man that would be the king of israel he might not look like a king to those people but he sure must look like it's a god because he he anointed him king anyhow see he took the simple of david's family or jesus family to to make king something that the world had turned down the eterna sent him back to take care of the sheep he brought forth his forth his first son a great strong stately looking man probably could stand erect look like a king of israel and that's the one they thought would look good with the crown on his head that's the one with where the the kingly garment and could pack the staff and whatever must be done to a king he looked good to the eyes of the people but the prophet with anointing oil in his hand said heaven he got another one and he brought him one by one and so finally he said haven't you got another one he said i've got one but perhaps he wouldn't be nothing he's just a little dried up sort of a fellow he got him out there heard in sheep and said go get him and as soon as he fell in the eyes of the anointed prophet he poured all upon his hand head and running to meet him he said this is the one god chose see it's not tinsel always of the world it's god's choosing by grace he chose us so we're grateful for that this morning and it doesn't take those great tinsel things of the world the homeless can be a servant of christ take somebody who's willing god anointed him so he takes the little things now why did he take little bethlehem seemed like there would have been greater places that the king great king of kings could been born usually when we fix up an event here on earth we try to get it the highest most glittering thing that we can think of we take it to the biggest places and spend the most money and the most elaborate things that's the way we do it but god don't do it that way he takes something that's nothing so he can show himself to be mighty that he can if he'd talk a high priest or a well-trained man in the days when he's calling the apostles if he took that instead of an ignorant unlearned fisherman who couldn't even write his own name they can say oh that seer education pays off but god took a man who couldn't even ride his name that he could take something he could get in his hand something that he can make something out of to show that he's gone we get to a place that we realize that we're nothing then get in god's hands and he can mold you make you the way he wants you to be but as long as we feel that we're important then you'll never get nowhere you can't even get in the hands of god until we realize that we're not important one of my little girls was asking the other day about importancy i said well talk about some important man well it was a president that was just assassinated and our hearts as grieved over it and i said well he was an important man the papers plated up the television shot at billions and billions of dollars it cost the government to broadcast that which that's all right that's their business but i said this little pentecostal preacher up there in kalani a man walked in a drunk with a shotgun called for his wife and shot the man come out of the pool fitness shot his wife and shot himself a little piece in the back of the paper about that thing let me tell you brother no matter who we are if you want to know how important you are say them a little girl stick your finger in a bucket of water pull it out and try to find the hole we are nothing they're only one important that's god we must remember he's the one look like if they wanted to man had been fixing a place for the king to be born there was more greater religious places and historical places for the king instead of this little bethlehem places for instance like shiloh shallows where the ark was pitched first we know as we come across were come across the jordan to this side in palestine and where the ark was set up for its first worship please or gilgal zion zion a great place gilgal also are the proud great capital of jerusalem where the heads of all the organizations gathered at their headquarters looked like they'd have fixed the place up there at jerusalem for the great king to be born if they wanted a place a historical place or a great outstanding place that's where the religious headquarters was of their religion to which the king came to he came to represent their religion and he and when he did instead of them fixing a place at jerusalem or one of those great historical spots he was born in bethlehem the smallest of all the cities are though not least among the princes of judea but out of these shall come a governor that shall rule my people and this great proud jerusalem and all the other cities was rejected or maybe they could took some of the places of refuge the great place like hebron katie's rhema gilead one of those great refuge city because he was to be our refuge if we're crying fixing our own mind we might have to say well now if this great king's coming which will be our refuge he should be born in one of these great memorial places of a refuge like uh raymond gilead or katie sure or one of those we would have tried to fix it like that in our minds but you see god has other ways of doing things he knows how to do things right now by the mind of god and the help of god we'll try to say why did this happen because everything works just exactly right in god's great program and i want you people here at phoenix and around to try to get this that remember that god knows what he's doing and he takes simple means to do it by because if he does something by some great outstanding something then god never does do things like that he never did in all the history of the bible god never did deal never did in any time take any group of people to do anything god takes an individual you're the one you one person god never changes his program because his first program he must always remain with that program in the days of noah had one man noah the days that he brought israel out he had one man that was moses we know what david and many others tried to think well they had the same authority and so forth you know what happened to them the days of the coming of the lord the days of john the baptist and the different ones he has one individual he works with and he deals with us today as one individual not as a group one person it's going to be up to you and i how we stand before god because he's dealing with you and i as individuals not as a group that we're in and not if the the nomination church we belong to but as you and i as individuals now josh away in dividing up the land give this little spot to judah many of y'all have got some places here jotted down to where it sets that but we're all aware of that where it sets up in the corner and it was just a little place that they give it to joshua in dividing the land give that to the tribe of judah and now when israel come over the river of jordan now try to catch this when israel crossed over into the land the promised land there was a gentile woman that we know as rahab the harlot and she asked for mercy and she received mercy she received mercy as long as she stayed under that scarlet card and that's the only way she could have mercy it was a sign of tolkien that was giving her we have a token today also and we're safe as long as we stay under our scarlet card the blood of jesus christ as an individual not a group an individual we each must stay under that scarlet card of the blood of jesus christ and then this rehab after she was spared she got all her people in everything that was under the card was was saved just like when god in egypt when all was under the blood was saved all was under the scarlet card was saved all under the blood of jesus is saved all out from uttered is lost and it's ready for destruction and we find out now in doing this then we understand by history that she courted some general i don't know his name right now in israel's army and she finally married this man and they settled up here in this near this little place and her son solomon was the one who founded bethlehem see a gentile is connected with it to begin with a gentile rahab the heart now we find out that salomon founded this little city of bethlehem and he bega got boaz and boaz was the one who married ruth another gentile and we're following this lean each now ruth she got she was a mobianite and she married boaz and came in to this little city just in barley season oh if we had the time this morning uh on that i'd owe my wife six dresses afterwards but how to dwell on that subject neoma representing the orthodox church was went away on the count of a famine went over into the land of voya like the scattering of israel all out among the nations and then as she came back she brought back ruth the mobinite and she returned just in barley season just the gathering in of the first barley that is that the gentile church coming to god just at barley season again what a beautiful picture there and then she and boaz being married and their famous son over it was begotten there and also born and then his son great son jesse came from over there also he begat david his son the king david come out look at this coming up now from rehab the harlot her son founding it from that come um from that come boaz which brought in another gentile and then from boaz uh come jesse and here jesse uh to jesse was born david and david right here at this same little bethlehem was anointed by the prophet of god to be the king of israel all these spiritual things hid from the eyes of the world what's happening here in this little city of bethlehem see that's the way god does now i trust that the holy spirit will be present now to give you a correct understanding that god doesn't work out in these big things it's by the spirit not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the lord see god working in the spirit among the people see these great backgrounds he could only come to this city that's the only place he could be born god following his same line god always does that god follows the line of his word he cannot go back on his word by no means and then remain god he's got to stay with the word he can never leave that today our traditions and so forth take us from the word we have creeds and things we inject into the word which pollutes the whole thing but god can never leave the line of his word his word is true always because he is the word god and his word is the same now we see here how that this little bethlehem yet being unnoticed a little place not noticed too much to the outside world just the smallest of the cities nobody paid any attention to it but yet god had in his purpose that that's where all these things have happened now the spiritual mind would pick that up because the prophet said here you see the prophet said thou bethlehem of judea are thou not the least among the princes but out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people israel the prophet the mind of the prophet found it what's those spiritual holy spirit today leading those things don't make endeavors what the world says and all of its tinsel what's the holy spirit in the word there's word come how about when job died and specified his burial place along came abraham abraham bought the partial ground to bury his wife sarah and abraham when he died wanted to be buried with sarah abraham begot isaac isaac when he died wanted to be buried with abraham isaac begot jacob jacob died plumbed down in egypt but he made joseph his prophet's son swear by him with his hand on his living hip that he would not bury him down in egypt why said take me up into the land and there let him be buried and joseph when he died down in egypt made mention of the departing of an israel going out according to the prophecy but said take my bones out of this land why they knew the first fruits of the resurrection was coming up from that land because job said i know my redeemer liveth not the last days he'll stand up on the earth and though the skin worms destroys this body yet in my flesh shall i see god they knew that first fruits of resurrection was coming out of the promised land not egypt they were spiritual they were prophets and when jesus died on on good friday and raised up on easter morning the following sunday morning the bible said that many of the saints that slept in the dusty earth raised up and come out of the graves went into the city went on in the glory with him why it was in prophets that knowed exactly where to be buried at the place and at the time is hid from the eyes of the wise but they knew what what they looked at the spirit side the the first fruits of the resurrection was to come out of palestine not out of egypt so is it today friends so many people hold on to things of the world or some great system or something bury me in jesus for those that are in christ will god bring with him that resurrection i don't care what the world's got to say how much they try to tensilize things it's in christ those that are in christ that god will bring with him the spiritual mind catches those spiritual things here the prophet said little bethlehem art thou not the least among all the princes of judah but out of these shall come this governor not out of the big self-style capital not out of some historical church grounds or something where the methodist baptist presbyterian pentecostal a lot more started but out of the least of these have a little insignificant place where i bring forth this place my ruler of the people but today we won't say our fathers did this and our fathers did that see god ignores every bit of that god does what he wants to watch the line of the spirit watch the way the the scripture reads they were ignorant to that but you see the scripture is what's right always god is right david was anointed by this great prophet to be king no doubt that samuel this great prophet knew these things beforehand and it was there that his great promised spiritual seed for god swore by an oath that he would raise up christ to set on the throne of david then where else could christ be born here is his father born his grandfather's great grandfather great great great great great home back see his people in the line of the gentiles brought in and now the bible said that in his name will the gentiles trust it all has to be brought in so you can see it we like to stay there for a while and dwell on that and show you why the gentiles but i'm sure the spiritual mind will catch this right away now because being the mothers and not the father now because it was the woman the bride the gentile will be made up the bride will be made up of gentiles the gentile he'll take a people out of the gentiles for his namesake that's his name he took a wife see out of the gentiles that's how it had to be woman come in church and she would they were gentiles the grandmothers back in the line of the seed now just as isaac was in the line of the seat otherwise now notice this we find out then that david had this promise of a son now we notice how that parallels again with israel where israel or abraham was promised in his seed what it would be that out of his seed would come this great savior and he be father all the nations his natural seed of course was isaac and it failed but his spiritual seed by the faith that he had come christ which brought in all of the nations well now the same thing is parallel here again david's natural seed was solomon and it backslid just like the other seed of abraham did it backslid so did solomon backslide you got too many women and the first thing you know they let his heart away from god and the way he went and backslid died that way eventually israel died in the same way vaccine but we find out that this spiritual seed which was promised by the natural seed as a lineage of people coming through abraham but as a the kingship come through the spiritual promise of david and david was born in bethlehem and he was anointed in bethlehem and then we find out then that when his real royal uh seed heir to his throne was born in this same city little bethlehem now at least amongst all the princes of judah but out of he shall come a governor that shall rule my people in this little town little stable city stable down on the side of the bluff was a cave back in the bluff and out of there came forth through its little doors the prince of peace born in a stable in a a little box of of straw sitting somewhere manure piled up in the barns and so forth but out of there came that great princess the seed of the woman out of there came the savior the world out of there came jehovah himself in the form of a man came out of that little humble stable in bethlehem not in some king's palace born in royalty but there he came from that humble place to a manure stack down in there and was wrapped in swelling's clothes tradition says it was taken from the yoke of an ox where they've been planned with him poor people joseph and mary both real poor and here they was in this little stable how humble god makes himself and then we try to make ourselves something great can't you see how god humbles himself and takes the things it's not that he might bring to pass his great promises how that little jehovah laying in a manger wrapped in the the cloth taken off of the back of a yoke uh the neck of a yoke where ox had been and wrapped the prince of peace in it who are we then what do we deserve if god can humble himself like that often we to be able to humble ourselves to become his servant if he did things like that can't we forget our uh dignities and things of this world and pass from that and humble ourselves before him this christmas and be showing our appreciations of that birth and that humility by humbling our own selves and receiving his word no matter what the tradition says it's his word that counts that's what he'll take his word and that only now we find out this little stable it was there that the first noel was ever saying on earth and it was singed by angels think of it the first noil not sung up there with campuses not down at some great fine church where a wonderful pastor was but at a stable in bethlehem the least among all of them but the first oil was sang by angelic beings in the little city of bethlehem see what i mean no matter how poor you are how little or insignificant you might be god can use you if you'll just let him do so god wants you you don't want you you don't have to belong to some great society some great order or some great uh brotherhood or whatever it might be that don't mean nothing to god god wants you and if you're if you feel that you're great get that feeling out of you you've got to get it out you say well i have a phd lld that just takes you that much further from god forget the thing come back to god come back to the humility of the spirit and love god and take his word if you abide me in my word in you then ask what you will it'll be done for you god promise that if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt your heart but believe that what you say will come to pass you can have what you said he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he also even greater than this shall he do for i go to my father what promises there's something lacking somewhere what we try to do is twist it up and make it some great something up there put fire and tissue on it and we pollute it just like the nations has done christmas if we could get the tinsel off of the things of the the humility back in the human heart if we could bring the humility back to christmas what it ought to be not a commercial day not lights and santa clauses but back to worship in the god of creation who come at a stable it was born a baby god made flesh and dwelt among us we could come back to that get away from the tits on the big things god don't even deal with it all you say well i belong to the biggest organization that takes you that much farther from god you say i do this that that just takes you that much further you've got to humble yourself until you see that until if you abide me in my words abide in you and ask what you will what we try to do this is what god gives us a little shower of blessings we try to twist it all up and get dignitaries in there let's go to make great big names now do the other nissan starts this way and that way god leaves a whole thing what we need today is a fresh pouring out of the holy spirit upon hearts that's humble we need a real christmas of birthplace if you could realize that you're nothing but a stable god didn't go to jerusalem to shiloh or ramos gilead he come to a stable that was polluted you let god you become and realize in yourself that you're nothing but a stinking stable but welcome open your doors when these great big places and the ends are turning away open your doors of the manger your heart and let jehovah come into that and watch what takes place for he is the word he said if you abide me in my word in you he is the word let him come into you watch what takes place then ask what you will and it'll be done for you yes it was there the first noel was by angels many years ago now we know the message must be very important that god wanted to say that or he broke in on a message to do something like that humble yourselves or the hands of god was the message of him now our heavenly father we know that our all wisdom and does everything just right we pray that you'll grant now that this might be a message to the people that they truly must humble ourselves all of us and come under the hand of the mighty god we commit ourselves to you father that you'll grant this to us in jesus name my son amen now to continue on i was speaking of when the first noel was saying was saying by angels at little bethlehem there's where all these great men were born that's where the promise of the king was born the promised king came to that now the word to get quickly now so i won't hold you too long the uh a promise the word was this the word bethlehem let's break it down i skipped over a few notes here in order to take up the time now bethlehem the word b-e-t-h means house e-l means god in hebrew e-l-h-e-m is bread bethlehem the house of god's bread that's what the word means words names they have meanings many people don't believe that but that's true if names don't have some meaning why did abram's name have to be changed to abraham why did sarah have to be changed to sarah why does saul have to be changed to paul why simon has to be changed to peter all these has meanings everything has meanings and the name bethlehem means the house of god's brain now how fitting that is to jesus the bread of eternal life christ is the bread of life we all believe that don't we how fitting bethlehem there the bread center of the world was the bread center of eternal life that's why the king had to be born there he said in saint john 6 35 i am the bread of life that come from god out of heaven your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and all dead but this spread if a man eats this bread he shall live forever then jesus is the bread of life so the bread of life had to come at bethlehem he is our bread of life for the journey like israel god gave israel bread out of the skies for their journey as they journeyed from where they left egypt unto the promised land bread nightly rain down from the sky and god gave us the bread of life for our journey come at bethlehem god's house of bragging see how it had to be it must be where that name is called bethlehem the house of god's bread then how could he be born in jerusalem how could he be born in ramos gilead see he come to where his name was house of god's bread oh notice israel receive a new fresh bread every night coming down from heaven for their journey christ is our life bread of life and every day we receive a freshness from christ from heaven the holy spirit coming down upon the believer every day fresh yesterday's experience many of us live on yesterday's experience we mustn't do that it's today's experience that's what's the matter with our denominations they're living on the experience of john wesley upon the experience of dwight moody finney sankey knox calvin many of those back there that are living on that experience but remember the bread that fell and they tried to keep it over it got contaminated maggots got in it little wiggle tails and that's what's the matter today contaminated cisterns living off past bread that's contaminated we must have something fresh from christ his word today for this hour he is our freshness our bread that falls every day from heaven upon the believer he is our bethlehem god's house of eternal life bread christ was born in bethlehem and became god's house of eternal life bread he is the bread of life he is our bethlehem christ is our bethlehem natural bread is called the staff of life we call the natural bread like our light bread and stuff we get is called the staff of life jesus is god's life staff of a bread of life staff for eternal life as the staff of life is called bread jesus being the bread of life is god's staff of eternal life bread to us see we can't go something must die so we can eat this morning when you eat you eat dead substance if something doesn't die then you cannot live cause you only live by dead substance if you eat meat the hog died eat pork the hog diet of course then if you eat the beef the cow died you said but i eat bread then the wheat died well i ate greens the greens died you only live by dead substance and that's the only way you can live then if you can only live natural by dead substance something had to die so you can live natural how much more did something have to die so you live eternally christ died that we might live eternally and he become the house of god's eternal life bread that we catch freshly every hour of the day coming down from god out of heaven in the form of the holy spirit feeds our hungry souls as we set together in heavenly places he is our bethlehem that all true believing sons of god are born in bethlehem with him if christ had to become the bread of life to be born in bethlehem which is life's bread house then every one of true believers in christ is born in christ they are born in god's bethlehem amen then only jesus was born in bethlehem i was born in bethlehem you were born in bethlehem how did you do it right you're in phoenix arizona this morning in the remark you can be born again in god's bethlehem house of eternal bread life he's going to live forever why little bethlehem that's today why a bunch of little holy rollers why this that or the other that people don't know what it's all about but the spirit reveals if the word chose it it's a manifestation of god's word we have life through christ in him alone our organizations our denominations our differences only separates us from god we have one access to god and that's through jesus christ there's not another way that we can come through but no priest no preacher no system or nothing else only jesus christ and him crucified he's god's bread of life and we are born in him and if he is god's breath of life and he is bethlehem and being born in christ we are then god born in bethlehem in christ jesus setting together in heavenly places eating of him eating of him who is he he's the word in the beginning was the word and the word is with god and the word was god and when we can sit with one objective the word of god and feed up on there we are in god's spiritual bethlehem eating god's spiritual bread and our souls punctuating every word that he spoke with an amen we enjoy this heavenly angel food when it says these signs shall follow them to believe the creed of denomination says audience and soul but the real man who's born in bethlehem says amen the works that i do shall you do also the denomination says it's a bunch of work up emotion but the real bethlehem dweller says amen because he's satisfied that's angel food if you abide me in my words and you guess what you will that'll be done for you amen all the high and prudent will never sip we hold so much to our traditions over the elders so much that we have to pack cards and everything else to get in some pulpit that ain't it you can get in god's pulpit by humbling yourselves come into the house of the bread of life jesus christ and live forever in his presence and lifted up in heavenly places in christ jesus feasting on the word that's god's bethlehem how many of us is in it this morning how many is willing to forget your traditions how many would you forget your creed that disagrees with the word why we got a revival why haven't we got these things going on what's the matter with pentecost it organized itself that's you can't organize pentecost you can make an organization but the pentecost is a blessing it's a power of god and if it's a pentecost it'll never bypass a word for a creed it'll take the word but because it's circumcised from the world and the things of the world it sets only on the word of god we're in bethlehem candidates for the kingdom of god we're eating god's eternal life bread born god bread born in bethlehem to become the spiritual bread of life of eternal life in the house of god oh my born in bethlehem we are this morning when we're born in jesus christ for he is god's bethlehem jesus is god's house of eternal life bread he also is our water for the journey now we know that he is the water like israel in their journey even if they snort a rock and their bread come down out of heaven but a rock was smitten so that they could drink from it for the sustainings of their life in the journey god smote a rock or had moses to do it as prophet smoke the rock what was it open the rock if the rock was christ do you believe it all right then if the prophet opened the rock so life could come out then if it is a rock today we need the holy spirit and some man who will smite back the rock amen and let the word come out because he is the word we've got cast on creeds and drinking stagnated water from sisters what we need today is the opening of the worm that lives and he's the same yesterday today and forever he cannot fail they could call it mental effort they didn't say whatever they want to or spiritually our devil as long as that word's flowing free and produced exactly what it said it would do it's a fountain in the house of david again back in bethlehem where the jesus christ is saying yesterday and day forever through his
