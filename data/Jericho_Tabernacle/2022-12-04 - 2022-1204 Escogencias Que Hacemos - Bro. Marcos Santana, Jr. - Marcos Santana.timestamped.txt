[48:52] [Music]
[48:54] I'm going to embarrass you a bit brother
[48:57] and if you can forgive me for that
[49:02] Ricardo uh first time I met brother
[49:04] Ricardo uh
[49:07] the young men we had some fellowship it
[49:10] is
[49:12] we went out to eat for some dinner
[49:14] [Music]
[49:18] Ricardo we were fellowshipping there
[49:20] with the young people and with brothers
[49:25] and throughout the time that we were
[49:28] having that clean healthy fellowship and
[49:30] Christian Fellowship
[49:33] the goal was to try to get to know this
[49:37] young man
[49:39] and we talked with him
[49:41] we started a friendship with him
[49:47] we tried to show him God's love the best
[49:50] way possible
[49:52] and as he poured out his heart
[49:58] which was a bit tough for him to
[50:21] I noticed that he had a very good spirit
[50:24] in heart
[50:26] there's something really special inside
[50:28] of him
[50:30] and he didn't even know the words that
[50:32] he said
[50:35] but there's always a deep calling
[50:37] another deep
[50:40] we don't know it
[50:43] so we need from God
[50:49] out here in the world
[50:53] Cristiano born in the world or born in a
[50:55] Christian home
[50:59] we need God in our lives
[51:04] you must be born again
[51:06] [Music]
[51:08] and he said those words
[51:10] [Music]
[51:13] and we said what do you wish for
[51:15] something
[51:17] do you feel something you see yeah he
[51:21] says I've been having it's been a good
[51:23] time now
[51:25] that I've had an emptiness inside of me
[51:28] it is
[51:30] I don't know what it is but I know
[51:35] that I need something else
[51:37] I need something
[51:55] and the news that I got this morning
[52:01] is that there's another soul that will
[52:03] surrender
[52:05] I don't believe anyone forced him or
[52:09] manipulated him
[52:11] but he out of his own choosing
[52:14] has come here and has listened
[52:19] he's seen God's power here in this place
[52:21] and today
[52:24] is such a happy day
[52:27] if I'm happy
[52:31] how much more our brothers are happy
[52:37] it's a great joy for me in my heart
[52:42] the best choice you could have made in
[52:44] your life
[52:47] you're my confirmation this morning
[52:52] this morning's title for the message is
[52:59] the the choices we make
[53:13] I'm not a person prone to get overly
[53:16] excited but I'm just full full of joy
[53:18] this morning
[53:21] I think Brothers for the opportunity
[53:26] I've been sick over a week
[53:32] the Thanksgiving the from this new cold
[53:36] that has been bothering me even before
[53:38] Thanksgiving
[53:41] and I said if my voice doesn't come back
[53:43] to me then I'll be unable to preach this
[53:45] morning
[53:48] God gave me all the symptoms and but not
[53:51] did not take away my uh voice
[53:54] so because of that we're here this
[53:56] morning
[53:58] [Music]
[54:07] if you
[54:11] have that desire that you know you need
[54:14] from God
[54:17] we're not here to put on a show this
[54:19] morning
[54:23] to display the almighty God this morning
[54:28] so just as you are standing if you'll be
[54:30] so kind to open your Bibles
[54:35] so the book of Hebrews chapter 11 verse
[54:38] 32.
[54:43] once again the title is the choices that
[54:45] we make
[54:47] I'll switch over to English now
[54:50] Hebrews 11 32.
[54:54] it reads descent and what shall I more
[54:57] say for the time would fail me to tell
[55:00] you of Gideon and of Barack and of
[55:02] Samson and of jephthah and of David also
[55:05] and Samuel and of all the prophets
[55:17] bow our heads in prayer
[55:20] Lord Heavenly Father Celestial what a
[55:24] beautiful and rejoicing day this is this
[55:27] morning Lord
[55:31] once again another Soul surrenders your
[55:34] life to you guys
[55:38] might be Souls they want to rededicate
[55:41] themselves to you this morning
[55:46] they want to grow in you guys
[55:49] as we all just want more and more of you
[55:52] this morning guys
[55:55] father help us with this small and
[55:58] simple talk this morning
[56:02] and take us in the path you want us to
[56:04] go today
[56:08] forgive me Lord for my shortcomings
[56:12] and let it be you that speaks to your
[56:14] people this morning
[56:17] open up every heart from the one
[56:20] speaking to the one listening
[56:24] correct who needs Corrections
[56:32] and may we all just grow in your word
[56:34] according to the measure that we need
[56:36] this morning
[56:41] Father we love you guys
[56:44] because you first loved us
[56:47] we put this service in your hands
[56:50] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[56:56] you may be seated Brothers
[57:02] thank you brother I appreciate
[57:04] it once again the title is the choices
[57:06] that we make
[57:11] if you'd like to go into the scriptures
[57:13] in the Book of Judges 11 hours
[57:16] we're going to continue on or piggyback
[57:19] the the scripture in Hebrews
[57:25] and it'll be starting in verse 30.
[57:29] we're going to be talking about
[57:32] it says and Jeff the vowed a vow unto
[57:36] the Lord and said if Thou shalt without
[57:38] fail deliver the children of Ammon into
[57:40] my hands
[57:46] then what then it shall be that
[57:48] whatsoever cometh forth out of the doors
[57:50] of my house to meet me when I return in
[57:53] peace from the children of Ammon shall
[57:55] surely be the Lords and I will offer it
[57:57] up as a burnt offering Victorious
[58:30] and the children of Ammon were subdued
[58:33] unto the children of Israel I see
[58:35] foreign
[59:04] and
[59:30] and she said unto her father
[59:32] respond let this thing be done unto me
[59:39] and and let me go into the mountains and
[59:42] beware my virginity
[59:46] and he and he sent her to go away
[59:50] and she bewailed her virginity in the
[59:53] mountains
[59:54] and it came to pass at the end of those
[59:57] two months
[59:59] when she was mourning the fact that she
[1:00:01] never got to get married
[1:00:06] never got to have a family or children
[1:00:09] Familia she returned back to her father
[1:00:14] who did according to his vow which he
[1:00:17] had vowed
[1:00:21] I was I was a little unfamiliar with
[1:00:23] this story
[1:00:25] and as I dove into it I I didn't realize
[1:00:29] how impactful the story
[1:00:34] how many emotions are in this story
[1:00:39] how many nuggets are within this story
[1:00:43] and once again the title the choices
[1:00:45] that we make
[1:00:48] and I know we all believe in
[1:00:50] predestination
[1:00:53] and the foreign
[1:01:17] baptized if I go out into the world God
[1:01:19] will bring me back some way somehow
[1:01:22] this is
[1:01:26] because in the end everything is already
[1:01:29] predestined
[1:01:32] my choices don't need anything it means
[1:01:36] is
[1:01:37] because God's in control of every single
[1:01:40] little thing
[1:01:42] you know it's kind of funny
[1:01:45] because then you could think more than
[1:01:47] God ordained me and foreign
[1:02:24] to make mistakes
[1:02:26] to make every single choice that I make
[1:02:30] one day we're gonna find out
[1:02:34] that the choices that we make
[1:02:38] has a lot to do what happens in our
[1:02:41] personal life
[1:02:44] like the choice our brother Ricardo is
[1:02:48] like the choice last week or two weeks
[1:02:50] ago that our sister Lydia has made it
[1:02:55] they had to make that choice
[1:02:59] is the message what thinking of Christ
[1:03:04] you've got to make a choice
[1:03:08] God compels you to make a choice
[1:03:14] you can't leave that door tonight
[1:03:19] you can't leave that door this morning
[1:03:24] without some sort of choice
[1:03:29] apprentices it's impossible is
[1:03:33] impossible the word is Flowing
[1:03:36] if the word has been bred is
[1:03:39] and it's making an effect in your life
[1:03:42] there's a choice that we're going to
[1:03:44] make
[1:03:46] it's impossible that we leave without
[1:03:48] making the choice
[1:03:54] we spoke a little bit on this in
[1:03:56] Flagstaff
[1:03:58] in Flagstaff there was a choice
[1:04:00] presented to him
[1:04:02] when he was asked what part of the land
[1:04:05] do you want
[1:04:08] he was it was put in his hands to have
[1:04:11] the first choice of the
[1:04:13] lands
[1:04:16] if you like the snow if you like the
[1:04:18] desert if he liked the the green trees
[1:04:24] he could pick whatever he wanted it was
[1:04:26] his choice
[1:04:30] no one was imposing upon his choice
[1:04:38] he didn't consult Pastor Abraham
[1:04:41] and therefore he made the most
[1:04:43] devastating choice of his life
[1:04:49] to move him and his family even closer
[1:04:52] to sin
[1:04:53] family
[1:04:55] a choice that cost him
[1:04:59] the life of his daughters
[1:05:06] and the life of his wife
[1:05:09] was a Christian
[1:05:12] he had a church
[1:05:14] he had a pastor and God's grace if you
[1:05:18] read the story
[1:05:21] it was with lot throughout his life
[1:05:26] he was given Grace to choose wherever he
[1:05:29] wanted in the land
[1:05:46] God's grace went found him and took him
[1:05:48] out
[1:05:51] but even through God's tender hand in
[1:05:53] his life
[1:05:57] there were still choices that lot had to
[1:06:00] make
[1:06:02] and we have to make the right choice
[1:06:10] you have a choice
[1:06:14] God made it so that you can choose
[1:06:19] if he put Adam and Eve on free moral
[1:06:22] agencies so that they can choose
[1:06:29] and then they made the wrong choice
[1:06:33] then he can do no more than he can do no
[1:06:37] more to you than what he did to them
[1:06:42] he's got to put you on the same thing so
[1:06:46] that you can choose or
[1:06:48] rejects
[1:06:52] is plain and simple you have a choice
[1:06:58] you have a choice as a young man
[1:07:01] whether you're going to have an
[1:07:03] education or not
[1:07:05] you have a choice of your conducts
[1:07:11] you can look like a decent human being
[1:07:16] or you can be one of these weird
[1:07:19] creatures that they have out there is
[1:07:29] courses are seen and they're completely
[1:07:31] against the word of God
[1:07:36] so are we understanding we have a choice
[1:07:41] we need to make the right choice
[1:07:45] you know young people here today
[1:07:49] you can choose who it is that you want
[1:07:52] to marry
[1:07:54] it's in your hands
[1:07:56] you see guidance you see counseling
[1:08:00] you put it in God's hands
[1:08:03] you
[1:08:05] see the signs from God
[1:08:09] but ultimately you make the choice
[1:08:13] and because of the wrong choices that we
[1:08:16] make
[1:08:19] in marriages
[1:08:21] those wrong choices
[1:08:24] have brought about the choice or the
[1:08:27] option of divorce
[1:08:30] and then maybe we find ourselves well
[1:08:33] God why did you let me marry that person
[1:08:34] yeah
[1:08:37] why did I marry her why did I marry him
[1:08:42] this confusion that comes about in us
[1:08:47] if I could say
[1:08:49] I think the only person who could say to
[1:08:52] God
[1:08:54] if we could say uh uh could could kind
[1:08:57] of get a little uh uh rough with God
[1:09:04] Adam Adam didn't have five women to
[1:09:06] choose from
[1:09:08] Adam didn't have 10 20 30 churches to
[1:09:12] pick sisters
[1:09:19] God that's the woman you gave me
[1:09:24] you gave her to me I didn't choose her
[1:09:27] but young Brothers young sisters
[1:09:31] God's given you plenty of sisters here
[1:09:33] in the church
[1:09:35] plenty of little brothers here in the
[1:09:37] church
[1:09:39] that you can choose from
[1:09:42] choose from
[1:09:45] make the right choice
[1:09:47] and if they're not here
[1:09:50] there's a church down the street
[1:09:53] there's some Believers down the way
[1:09:56] there's some in the next town the next
[1:09:59] city
[1:10:01] if she's not here he's not here
[1:10:05] they might be in New Mexico in Colorado
[1:10:07] and Texas
[1:10:11] they might be in Mexico
[1:10:13] in Mexico
[1:10:15] God only knows they might be in in I
[1:10:18] think this morning we have some brothers
[1:10:19] from Pakistan
[1:10:22] is Pakistan but you've got to make the
[1:10:26] choice Young Brother young sisters
[1:10:30] because your choice will affect the rest
[1:10:32] of your life
[1:10:36] the message leadership
[1:10:41] each one of us has to make a choice
[1:10:46] and it's confronted to us
[1:10:50] you know you confront somebody
[1:10:54] it's in your face so that choice is in
[1:10:58] your face is
[1:11:00] but we're all confronted with this one
[1:11:03] thing is
[1:11:08] brother Ricardo and Manuel Ricardo
[1:11:10] brother Brian says we're all confronted
[1:11:12] with this one thing
[1:11:16] what are we going to do about eternal
[1:11:19] life
[1:11:21] are we going to live here after or not
[1:11:26] then we've got to come to Jesus to get
[1:11:30] it
[1:11:31] Jesus
[1:11:32] that's the opportunity of choosing
[1:11:37] that's the one thing God gave us
[1:11:44] he just lets us make our own choice
[1:11:49] so you have to not be forced
[1:11:53] but just make your own choice
[1:11:56] you know looking at the Rich Young Ruler
[1:11:59] Alberta
[1:12:01] I really loved our brother Louise
[1:12:03] preached on it here
[1:12:05] and he also preached it very beautifully
[1:12:07] out there
[1:12:13] as the story tells us all he wanted was
[1:12:15] eternal life
[1:12:18] and what's amazing about him
[1:12:30] he just wanted to know what do I got to
[1:12:33] do to get it
[1:12:37] and when it was put in front of him
[1:12:41] the choice was put upon him
[1:12:45] he just simply failed that test
[1:12:50] Jesus gave him the answer but he walked
[1:12:52] away Jesus
[1:12:54] says that was the most fatal mistake
[1:12:57] that he ever made
[1:13:01] the choices that we make
[1:13:05] a foolish vow all right
[1:13:10] he he made a foolish decision
[1:13:14] with that vowel the Rich Young Ruler
[1:13:18] made a foolish choice
[1:13:21] where we walked where he walked away
[1:13:24] and we know where he ended up
[1:13:28] God did not predestinate Jeff to the
[1:13:31] sacrifice his daughter
[1:13:35] God could not predestinate jephthah to
[1:13:37] sacrifice his daughter
[1:13:41] God did not predestinate the Rich Young
[1:13:44] Ruler to walk away
[1:13:47] it was the choice that they had made
[1:13:53] so going back to the story of jephthah
[1:13:56] we see as we read
[1:13:59] that he really had this desire for God
[1:14:02] to deliver this people into his hands
[1:14:08] I don't know if maybe there was some
[1:14:10] arrogance there
[1:14:12] or just this Grand confidence in God
[1:14:17] or maybe just some sheer ignorance
[1:14:21] but you said you know I'll give you a
[1:14:23] sacrifice
[1:14:25] you do this for me
[1:14:28] and it's amazing the scripture says the
[1:14:30] word whatsoever is
[1:14:35] whatsoever comes through that door
[1:14:38] not whosoever goes through that door
[1:14:43] who knows what he might have been
[1:14:45] thinking
[1:14:47] maybe that part of his house that he was
[1:14:50] vowing to God
[1:14:53] whenever he would go out through there
[1:14:56] maybe it was a lamb that would walk by
[1:15:00] maybe it was a a bull or a donkey or an
[1:15:03] animal that would pass by
[1:15:06] that was the pattern of his day Victoria
[1:15:56] but Jefferson wasn't feeling the same
[1:15:58] way
[1:16:00] he never expected his daughter to walk
[1:16:03] through those doors foreign
[1:17:01] but I forget that these quotes over here
[1:17:03] say a little different
[1:17:07] the scriptures over here tell me one
[1:17:09] thing
[1:17:11] but the scriptures over here revealing
[1:17:14] it in just a little bit different of a
[1:17:15] way
[1:17:21] his duty should have been to take bowls
[1:17:26] and bring them back to the center is
[1:17:30] put them into a balance
[1:17:33] so then can we blame our decisions
[1:17:37] on God's predestination
[1:17:41] just a question to think about
[1:17:44] can we blame our personal decisions on
[1:17:47] God's predestination
[1:17:52] decision is that
[1:17:56] against God's word
[1:17:59] that were the case they were just
[1:18:02] puppets
[1:18:03] the strings dangling from on top of us
[1:18:08] and he's making every single decision
[1:18:10] for us
[1:18:12] so then do our actions
[1:18:16] our choices
[1:18:18] do they affect God's plan affected you
[1:18:22] know I I don't know if our brother
[1:18:23] Edward is here this morning
[1:18:25] Edward but we have the the pleasure of
[1:18:27] getting to know our brother Edward a few
[1:18:29] weeks back
[1:18:31] and I think to myself
[1:18:34] you got predestinate our brother Edward
[1:18:36] to go to prison foreign
[1:19:20] that he preordained and he he
[1:19:23] predestinated
[1:19:25] that I buy him the newest cell phone so
[1:19:28] they could be on it all day
[1:19:32] I am the newest video game so they can
[1:19:35] play on it all day
[1:19:38] I let him play with his worldly friends
[1:19:41] all day
[1:19:44] listen to that music worldly music all
[1:19:47] day
[1:19:49] and be able to say God predestinated
[1:19:54] I didn't have absolutely nothing to
[1:20:03] you know sometimes we blame God for
[1:20:06] those things
[1:20:08] but then sometimes we're a little more
[1:20:10] righteous foreign
[1:20:36] the title the choices that we make
[1:20:42] you look at Abraham
[1:20:44] the same like he only had one son
[1:20:49] Jeff's only had a daughters
[1:20:51] and God told Abraham we all know go
[1:20:55] sacrifice your son
[1:20:58] but the word says you can't do those
[1:21:01] human sacrifices
[1:21:05] so was that against the word of God
[1:21:09] was what God told him against the word
[1:21:17] God never intended for Abraham to
[1:21:19] sacrifice his son
[1:21:24] through their foreign
[1:22:15] Abraham was following the literal word
[1:22:18] of God
[1:22:20] that was spoken upon him foreign that
[1:22:24] was a commandment to him
[1:22:26] though he might have scratched his head
[1:22:30] no he found it illogical okay
[1:22:34] God told him to do this
[1:22:39] he did not expect what was going to
[1:22:41] happen in his life
[1:22:43] you know sometimes when we're in church
[1:22:47] the presence of God Is So Heavy it's not
[1:22:50] done
[1:22:52] that atmosphere that anointing in the
[1:22:54] building is
[1:22:57] very important for us to be wise
[1:23:01] for us to be balanced
[1:23:04] in the vows that we make God
[1:23:08] because sometimes that tremendous
[1:23:10] Supernatural feeling
[1:23:15] when you're shouting praises to God
[1:23:18] like like I remember my brother Boaz in
[1:23:21] Camp in America
[1:23:23] when he couldn't contain himself
[1:23:29] and even with his injured legs
[1:23:34] anointing so heavy
[1:23:37] jumping up and down on the stage
[1:23:39] praising God
[1:23:43] speaking in tongues
[1:23:47] crying tears of joy
[1:23:49] sing it with all your heart dancing in
[1:23:52] the spirit
[1:23:54] you feel so good
[1:23:57] sometimes we can make a vow to God
[1:24:02] under that anointing
[1:24:05] and and I remember
[1:24:07] I have shared my testimony plenty of
[1:24:10] times
[1:24:11] you know the same thing happened to me
[1:24:15] when I had my experience 11 years ago
[1:24:19] I have morning on a Sunday I asked God
[1:24:23] give me a signal if you give me one that
[1:24:27] I can believe
[1:24:30] I vow or I promise to serve you
[1:24:35] I didn't stop there in no matter today
[1:24:37] I'll be honest I didn't know what I was
[1:24:40] saying
[1:24:42] I made it ignorantly at that
[1:24:45] momentum but I made it honestly in that
[1:24:48] moment
[1:24:49] and I also told him that morning
[1:24:53] I'll testify of it anywhere that I go
[1:24:56] okay
[1:24:58] because I know it was real to me
[1:25:02] he gave me the sign that morning
[1:25:05] I thank God I've been serving them ever
[1:25:07] since
[1:25:09] I don't plan on stop serving here
[1:25:14] I said I would testify wherever he takes
[1:25:17] me
[1:25:19] he's taking me all over the country and
[1:25:22] all over the world to testify
[1:25:26] from here to El Salvador El Salvador
[1:25:30] from El Salvador to South Africa El
[1:25:32] Salvador Africa under that anointing
[1:25:37] I didn't even know that I was making it
[1:25:42] God kept his part
[1:25:45] like you did with Jeff
[1:25:48] and all I can say is thank God
[1:25:51] they're up to right now I've been
[1:25:53] holding on to my part okay
[1:25:56] I pray as long as I'm here on this Earth
[1:25:59] I can keep to My Vow with God
[1:26:04] I don't know what vows you've made in
[1:26:06] your life
[1:26:09] I don't know what needs or what what
[1:26:11] desires you've had in your heart
[1:26:16] you made God that if he'll do this you
[1:26:18] promise to do that
[1:26:23] but if it doesn't impede your Christian
[1:26:25] walk
[1:26:28] I pray that you can keep that value made
[1:26:30] in privacy with God
[1:26:38] God answered
[1:26:43] and he made it to God
[1:26:45] no I heard a brother say it like this
[1:26:50] and I'll repeat the statement
[1:26:54] don't make a vow under the anointing
[1:26:59] that you can't keep out of the anointing
[1:27:05] so don't just make a vow just to God
[1:27:08] just to make a vows
[1:27:12] just to look good with him
[1:27:15] we're not in the business of fitting in
[1:27:17] with God
[1:27:21] we're in the business of being one with
[1:27:23] God
[1:27:26] so being serious with God
[1:27:29] love relationship with God
[1:27:32] he's more than just a friend to me
[1:27:36] he is my lover
[1:27:39] so don't make a vow with God
[1:27:43] just to Simply make a vows
[1:27:46] what happens Monday
[1:27:49] when the spirit has gone off for you
[1:27:52] when the 19 is left
[1:27:55] you forgot to have breakfast in the
[1:27:57] morning
[1:27:59] you woke up five in the morning for work
[1:28:03] now you're late and frustrated
[1:28:09] are you going to keep that vow
[1:28:12] under those terms
[1:28:15] in those moments those circumstances
[1:28:18] maybe you made a vow that was too high
[1:28:21] for you to keep
[1:28:25] so let's go back to jephthah
[1:28:28] he made it to Hebrews chapter 11.
[1:28:33] where they mentioned the heroes of the
[1:28:36] old testamentions
[1:28:39] men they mentioned Samson they mentioned
[1:28:41] David
[1:28:43] let's mentioned Samuel Samuel so
[1:28:46] jephthah wasn't a Mr Nobody
[1:28:50] was he anointed of God then
[1:28:53] when he made that vowel to make that
[1:28:58] burnt offering
[1:29:00] will he never imagined
[1:29:03] it would be a loved one
[1:29:05] then maybe it could be his wife
[1:29:08] his daughter some family members
[1:29:11] would God be the one to do that to him
[1:29:17] why did Jeff to follow through with the
[1:29:19] vowel
[1:29:22] maybe it was out of ignorance foreign
[1:30:31] enticing spirits espiritus
[1:30:34] even here in church
[1:30:36] when the spirit is moving
[1:30:39] someone genuinely can be having a Holy
[1:30:43] ghost-filled Experience here at the
[1:30:44] altarment
[1:30:48] and an enticing Spirit of nostalgia can
[1:30:50] come upon somebody
[1:30:54] of excitement of tears of somebody
[1:30:59] and it's not the Holy Spirit coming upon
[1:31:02] somebody
[1:31:05] but it's an enticing Spirit coming upon
[1:31:08] somebody
[1:31:11] sometimes it's very sad to say or and
[1:31:14] sad to believe
[1:31:17] that not everyone that comes to the
[1:31:20] altar okay
[1:31:21] come for genuine reasons
[1:31:27] I don't know yet
[1:31:30] enticing Spirits espiritus how many of
[1:31:33] us have made wrong decisions in our
[1:31:34] lives
[1:31:37] I've made plenty
[1:31:40] I'll confess I've done I've tried to do
[1:31:43] services to God without it being his
[1:31:45] will
[1:31:48] I'm sure I've been enticed by the wrong
[1:31:51] spirit before in my life
[1:31:57] so how many have made wrong decisions in
[1:32:00] their Christian Life this is
[1:32:16] that don't make no difference
[1:32:18] [Music]
[1:32:22] he still made a mistake
[1:32:24] David was elected
[1:32:26] he still made mistakes
[1:32:30] even Peter Aunt Pedro who was a
[1:32:32] hand-picked disciple is
[1:32:36] he made mistakes
[1:32:39] when he denied Jesus three times
[1:32:42] Jesus gave him a glimpse Jesus
[1:32:45] a little glimpse of predestination
[1:32:50] a glimpse of foreign
[1:33:00] God made Peter deny him
[1:33:04] I don't think God wanted Peter to deny
[1:33:07] him
[1:33:10] if anything I believe he was sad that
[1:33:13] Peter denied him
[1:33:17] looking down saying look at the Miracles
[1:33:20] you've been through
[1:33:21] is
[1:33:24] all the signs and wonders you've seen
[1:33:28] all this Faith you
[1:34:23] it's the foreknowledge of God that
[1:34:25] knowed which one would be right and
[1:34:27] which one was it right
[1:34:33] so by foreign
[1:35:30] he wanted me to go out into the world
[1:35:33] he wanted me to renounce the message
[1:35:38] he wanted me to spit in this Bible
[1:35:42] no that's silly
[1:35:44] it's illogical that's completely against
[1:35:48] the word
[1:35:50] he ordained us
[1:35:53] for Perfection
[1:35:55] he ordained us to help
[1:36:01] so good works
[1:36:03] wisdom salvation all these things
[1:36:07] so then how can he then ordain me to
[1:36:20] sinuses
[1:36:24] not even for divorce
[1:36:27] the prophet said he said prophet the
[1:36:30] greatest thing next to Salvation is your
[1:36:32] husband or your wife
[1:36:36] when I was studying they just kept
[1:36:38] blowing me away
[1:36:41] because the more I think about the
[1:36:43] choices that we make
[1:36:45] decisions it has so much to do with our
[1:36:48] Christian walk
[1:36:50] and if we take something so simple as
[1:36:53] our choice for marriage
[1:36:58] our good husband or a good wife
[1:37:04] ordain you to divorce
[1:37:08] what he called the greatest thing next
[1:37:12] to your salvation
[1:37:16] I can't explain
[1:37:18] the only answer I can give
[1:37:23] so is
[1:37:25] we make that choice
[1:37:28] but thank God foreign
[1:37:42] [Laughter]
[1:38:46] but it was never his will that we would
[1:38:48] do them
[1:38:50] the message it is I Be not Afraid
[1:38:55] this is so amazing here
[1:38:57] he cannot save you against your own will
[1:39:01] salvate
[1:39:03] you don't want to be safe
[1:39:07] you're a free moral agent it is
[1:39:11] you can turn it down
[1:39:14] oh you guys talk about that old white
[1:39:17] man Prophet guide
[1:39:21] my brother's there South Carolina
[1:39:23] brother Perry and a predominantly black
[1:39:25] church out there
[1:39:30] there's a lot of believed Christians in
[1:39:33] that area
[1:39:35] they give them so much criticism
[1:39:41] oh man y'all are crazy listening to that
[1:39:43] old white man
[1:39:46] they are free moral agents
[1:39:49] brother Brown says you can turn it down
[1:39:53] but you can accept it
[1:39:55] we're in the midst of a Hispanic
[1:39:57] congregation
[1:40:00] who chose to accept this
[1:40:02] English-speaking message
[1:40:09] or human language
[1:40:11] it's a Celestial race
[1:40:14] Celestial language
[1:40:17] and we chose to accept it
[1:40:21] says he cannot heal you against your own
[1:40:23] will contr
[1:40:29] but was that our first choice
[1:40:32] or was that our second choice
[1:40:36] because my doctor couldn't heal me
[1:40:41] and I'm a Christian is so Cristiano oh
[1:40:44] that's right I can go to the best doctor
[1:40:47] you don't work that way
[1:40:50] he won't heal you if you don't want to
[1:40:52] be here
[1:40:54] go to him first
[1:40:56] and then he'll say you know what yeah
[1:40:59] you've got the best cardiologist in
[1:41:02] Maricopa County
[1:41:06] and give you your healing through that
[1:41:08] doctor
[1:41:09] is
[1:41:13] against your will
[1:41:20] we spoke about him not too long ago
[1:41:23] he too made his choice
[1:42:01] but he knew that when the time came he
[1:42:04] would betray Jesus
[1:42:07] because he could not ordain him to do
[1:42:10] such a thing
[1:42:13] we just read in several messages we are
[1:42:16] free moral agents
[1:42:21] you want to betray Jesus
[1:42:24] you are more than welcome to portray him
[1:42:29] want to exalt him
[1:42:31] you want to accept him you want to be
[1:42:34] baptized like this morning our brother
[1:42:37] Ricardo just chose to be baptized
[1:42:41] then he foresaw that you wanted to be
[1:42:44] baptized
[1:42:48] predestinated for you to be baptized
[1:42:51] and like our brother the decision he
[1:42:53] made today yes
[1:43:24] and somehow merge it into that that
[1:43:28] perfect will through God's sovereignty
[1:43:29] yeah
[1:43:35] when I imagine I kind of see like a road
[1:43:39] and how it is that we make the wrong
[1:43:41] turn
[1:43:43] he doesn't grab a hold of our wheel and
[1:43:46] force Us in the wrong turn
[1:43:51] maybe something caught her eyes so we
[1:43:54] went the wrong way
[1:44:45] we're not his perfect will no foreign
[1:44:57] foreign
[1:45:57] Al final God only has one perfect will
[1:46:02] it's black or white is Blanco or negro
[1:46:05] either you're in that wheel oh you're
[1:46:08] out of that way
[1:46:09] Romans 8 says for whom he did foreign
[1:46:14] he did predestinate to be conformed to
[1:46:17] the image of his son
[1:46:22] so predestinated
[1:46:25] I love him I hate him I love him I hate
[1:46:29] him
[1:46:32] he's going to Hell she's going to heaven
[1:46:35] he's going to Hell she's going to heaven
[1:46:42] God cannot do that
[1:46:44] God doesn't work that way
[1:46:47] God gives us a choice amen
[1:46:52] otherwise he can't send people to hell
[1:46:57] he couldn't do it it wouldn't be just of
[1:46:59] him to send him to help
[1:47:03] we're getting to the end of the message
[1:47:06] and why some people can't keep the
[1:47:09] victory
[1:47:12] now a man's on the basis of free moral
[1:47:15] agency this is
[1:47:22] now I'm going to make you do this
[1:47:51] there's people that will only hear this
[1:47:54] gospel once in their life
[1:47:57] and with that one single time they'll
[1:48:00] accept him
[1:48:02] but there's people in the church that
[1:48:04] will hear it their whole lives
[1:48:07] and will never truly accept it
[1:48:11] and then there are those that are here
[1:48:13] for one time
[1:48:17] and they will go to hell
[1:48:19] and others that will hear it just one
[1:48:22] time
[1:48:25] and they will go to heaven
[1:48:27] now think about that same Story of
[1:48:30] Lazarus
[1:48:32] forgive me of the Rich Young Ruler um
[1:48:37] and and and we're told he went to hell
[1:48:40] is
[1:48:42] and how he saw Lazarus in Abraham
[1:48:46] and how he started screaming for help
[1:48:48] for his family
[1:48:56] everyone yes
[1:49:01] if you can Lazarus go back on the other
[1:49:04] side
[1:49:07] if Abraham can go back to the other side
[1:49:11] that's where the prophets can go back to
[1:49:13] the other side
[1:49:16] then my family will accept him
[1:49:20] but how does it say
[1:49:22] it don't matter if they go back
[1:49:25] they still will not accept him
[1:49:28] so there's people they will hear once or
[1:49:31] a million times
[1:49:35] and they still will not accept the word
[1:49:38] of God
[1:49:39] [Music]
[1:49:41] but thank God for his grace
[1:49:44] that all of us here in this building
[1:49:46] today
[1:49:48] we have yet another opportunity
[1:49:53] to correct maybe of that we made with
[1:49:55] him
[1:49:57] to correct maybe a decision we've made
[1:50:00] in our lives
[1:50:02] pain and suffering that we've been going
[1:50:05] through
[1:50:06] maybe we can recognize this morning
[1:50:11] God doesn't send anyone to hell yes
[1:50:15] if we're going to hell
[1:50:17] it's because we chose
[1:50:21] and if we're going to heaven
[1:50:25] if we're going to meet our Lord
[1:50:29] that's because he foresaw is
[1:50:32] and then he stamped a seal of
[1:50:35] predestination
[1:50:38] Upon Our Lives
[1:50:40] that we would choose him in this day
[1:50:44] like
[1:50:48] our brother Ricardo it shows
[1:50:51] you know this morning we don't need to
[1:50:53] have a funeral service this morning
[1:50:57] when this old man dies
[1:51:00] I want to bury him kick him get rid of
[1:51:02] him light him on fire get away with him
[1:51:07] don't give this body a funeral service
[1:51:12] I want to have a celebration of life
[1:51:15] service
[1:51:17] celebrate the life of God in Me
[1:51:55] do whatever you want to do about it
[1:51:58] he can't make you love him and
[1:52:01] he don't want to force you to love him
[1:52:06] if my wife has to force me to love her
[1:52:08] foreign
[1:52:20] but blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:52:23] Jesus Christ
[1:52:25] we love him
[1:52:28] because he first loved us
[1:52:32] and that is why we serve him
[1:52:35] cannot program you to love him
[1:52:41] it doesn't work that way
[1:52:44] that one day you tap into hey
[1:52:48] one day you tap into love
[1:52:51] no it's got to come from you
[1:52:55] it's a choice that we have to make
[1:52:59] the music if the musicians like to come
[1:53:01] forward
[1:53:04] and the message proving his word
[1:53:08] and if you like to play something Softly
[1:53:13] you know it's it's it's
[1:53:16] you know why the music is played in
[1:53:18] service
[1:53:20] when the minister is getting ready to
[1:53:22] finish yeah
[1:53:25] and ask the musicians to come forward
[1:53:28] it's because there's a word that has
[1:53:31] been spoken
[1:53:33] there's a word that has been read
[1:53:36] there's an atmosphere that everyone has
[1:53:39] created
[1:53:41] and when there's that pole
[1:53:45] the atmosphere is just Amplified through
[1:53:48] that music
[1:53:53] providing that pathway for you to come
[1:53:55] to his feet
[1:53:59] we're maybe in the doubts
[1:54:03] or maybe in in embarrassments
[1:54:07] the atmosphere can be made perfect for
[1:54:10] just you know
[1:54:14] I find it amazing even when the
[1:54:17] musicians don't get asked
[1:54:21] and you see in different churches
[1:54:26] they have the Revelation
[1:54:28] they have themselves
[1:54:31] because they're connected with God
[1:54:35] to help create that atmosphere is
[1:54:43] predestinated us to the adoption of
[1:54:45] children by Jesus Christ
[1:54:49] God's not saying I'll choose you and
[1:54:52] don't choose
[1:54:55] by foreign
[1:54:58] [Music]
[1:55:18] [Music]
[1:55:26] out the New Testament of the new
[1:55:27] testamento
[1:55:30] what happened to brother Branham
[1:55:33] what was the decision that he made
[1:55:36] one simple decision that he made
[1:55:40] one choice that he made
[1:55:43] it cut the life of his wife short
[1:55:48] it cut the life of his daughter stored
[1:55:50] in his life
[1:55:54] the consequences of our decisions made
[1:55:57] here on this Earth
[1:56:00] we need to be very careful
[1:56:04] because what we're going through
[1:56:07] many times it's just a product of our
[1:56:10] decision
[1:56:13] maybe somebody in here today I don't
[1:56:15] know
[1:56:17] I want to make it to Heaven God
[1:56:21] but you just keep giving me these trials
[1:56:25] you keep putting these hardships upon my
[1:56:28] life
[1:56:30] one thing it's another
[1:56:33] if this gets in my way then that gets in
[1:56:36] my way
[1:56:38] God he's like you're holding me back
[1:56:42] no it's the choices that we make noise
[1:56:46] that's holding us back
[1:56:49] God's will for you
[1:56:52] God's will for everyone here is
[1:56:57] eternal life is
[1:56:58] God's will is that nobody should perish
[1:57:03] Jesus Christ came to the worst on the
[1:57:05] Earth
[1:57:38] so that you would choose him
[1:57:43] our decisions
[1:57:47] our decisions
[1:57:49] they won't affect our predestination
[1:57:54] because God already saw that in here
[1:57:58] we all have mistakes
[1:58:01] with all that shortcomings
[1:58:03] but the choices that we make
[1:58:06] [Music]
[1:58:08] they're going to affect our lives
[1:58:12] restaurants
[1:58:14] [Music]
[1:58:17] and everything in between
[1:58:23] but Branham says
[1:58:25] and what you what went ye out to see
[1:58:30] you can't help being what you are
[1:58:33] I can't help it
[1:58:36] even if you're a sinner
[1:58:39] you're not responsible for being a
[1:58:41] sinner
[1:58:43] you hear that this morning
[1:58:45] you're not responsible for being a
[1:58:47] sinner
[1:58:50] you're responsible for remaining a
[1:58:52] sinner
[1:58:54] there's a way prepared for you
[1:58:57] but to be a sinner you was born that way
[1:59:01] God doesn't send you to hell for being a
[1:59:04] sinner
[1:59:06] God sends you to hell
[1:59:08] because you won't repent and take Christ
[1:59:11] as your savior
[1:59:15] repent and take Christ as your savior
[1:59:21] you refuse to take the right Road
[1:59:38] you send your soul into its Eternal
[1:59:41] destination
[1:59:44] upon the free moral agency of your own
[1:59:46] convictions
[1:59:50] God doesn't send anyone to hell because
[1:59:55] and he never will
[1:59:57] men send themselves to Hell Los Hombres
[2:00:02] men send themselves to hell
[2:00:06] because they refuse
[2:00:09] to accept the way of salvation
[2:00:14] close your eyes
[2:00:17] jephthah was a man of God
[2:00:19] he was a hero he was a Christian but he
[2:00:24] made us
[2:00:26] foreign
[2:01:26] he killed his daughter he broke up his
[2:01:29] home
[2:01:30] he broke my word
[2:01:33] but he kept his vow foreign
[2:02:54] throw barricades across your path
[2:02:57] but you walk on your own decision
[2:03:02] and many times we'll say
[2:03:05] if the Lord will take this evil spirit
[2:03:07] for me
[2:03:09] of drinking and gambling and lying and
[2:03:12] stealing the tomatoes
[2:03:15] I don't know if that's you
[2:03:17] brother Brandon says then I'll serve him
[2:03:20] foreign
[2:04:49] and if any one of my brothers and
[2:04:51] sisters has made a wrong choice this
[2:04:53] morning
[2:04:56] Father I know there's forgiveness for
[2:04:58] them
[2:04:59] there's forgiveness for me
[2:05:02] there's forgiveness for all of us
[2:05:08] restore them
[2:05:09] put them in that perfect place you've
[2:05:12] ordained them to be Lord
[2:05:14] [Music]
[2:05:16] and if anyone might be here this morning
[2:05:21] any maybe a religious person here this
[2:05:24] morning
[2:05:25] maybe just an assimilator here this
[2:05:28] morning
[2:05:30] someone just here because their wife
[2:05:33] brought him or their husband brought him
[2:05:37] because Mama comes to this church or
[2:05:39] daddy comes to this church
[2:05:42] they've heard a word here today okay
[2:05:46] it has been open and revealed today
[2:05:50] that there's a choice that we need to
[2:05:52] make
[2:05:54] and the greatest choice we can ever make
[2:05:57] is
[2:05:59] to accept you as our Lord and savior
[2:06:04] not a foolish vow unto you
[2:06:08] but a balanced Vow where we know where
[2:06:10] we stand on this morning
[2:06:18] and we know that you're changing our
[2:06:47] [Music]
[2:06:56] and bring us back to the balance of the
[2:06:59] word once again
[2:07:02] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[2:07:05] pray
[2:07:06] amen amen
[2:07:09] foreign

[2:20:37] since now when they heard this they were

[2:20:43] Peter and to the rest of the Apostles
[2:20:45] men and Brethren what shall we do
[2:20:48] is
[2:20:58] then Peter said unto them repent and be
[2:21:01] baptized every one of you in the name of
[2:21:04] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[2:21:07] and ye shall receive the gift of the
