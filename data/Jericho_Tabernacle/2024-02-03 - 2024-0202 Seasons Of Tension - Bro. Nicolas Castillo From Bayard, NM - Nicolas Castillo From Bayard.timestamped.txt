[26:11] Christ amen amen amen thank you to our
[26:14] musicians God bless
[26:17] you amen you may be
[26:20] seated amen I certainly like that
[26:24] uh uh announcement that was made earlier
[26:30] that brother Emanuel would be
[26:34] preaching I told him may the Lord knew
[26:36] something brother you needed to give us
[26:37] a part
[26:42] two how many appreciate our your brother
[26:45] Emanuel amen God bless amen I was here
[26:48] for Wednesday I appreciate him
[26:52] amen amen we're going to go right into
[26:54] the
[26:56] scripture uh for a title this evening I
[26:59] I felt led to to speak on the subject of
[27:08] job and some very wonderful things about
[27:10] job that there are
[27:13] amen and my title is the seasons of
[27:19] tension and now if you notice in this
[27:23] scripture
[27:25] here notice the dialogue between God and
[27:30] Satan as we go to to
[27:34] job6 he says one day the Angels Came to
[27:37] present themselves before the Lord and
[27:39] Satan also came with
[27:47] them and the Lord said to Satan where
[27:50] have you come from Satan answered the
[27:52] Lord from roaming throughout the earth
[27:55] going back and forth on it
[28:05] then the Lord said to Sayan have you
[28:08] considered my servant job there is no
[28:11] one on earth like him he is blameless
[28:14] and upright a man who fears God and
[28:18] shuns
[28:26] evil
[28:31] does job fear God for nothing Satan
[28:38] replied have you not put your hedge
[28:40] around him and his household and
[28:43] everything he has you have blessed the
[28:45] work of his hands so that his flocks and
[28:48] herds are spread throughout the
[28:56] land
[29:01] and Satan challenges
[29:04] him he says but now stretch out your
[29:07] hand and strike everything he has and he
[29:09] will surely curse you to your
[29:17] face what a bold thing to tell God to
[29:19] his
[29:22] face the Lord said to
[29:26] Satan very well well then everything he
[29:28] has is in your power but on the man
[29:31] himself do not lay a
[29:38] finger and how interesting this story
[29:43] is that
[29:45] God allows
[29:47] this God allows this to happen to job
[29:51] and his
[29:54] life and I thought to myself how
[29:56] wonderful
[29:59] that God does not wait for
[30:03] Satan to ask about
[30:07] job in fact it was
[30:10] God that told
[30:12] him hey have you
[30:16] considered my servant
[30:19] job God was putting his servant on the
[30:25] line he was testing Ying about
[30:29] him in fact God does some bragging on
[30:34] him now imagine being a a person of of
[30:38] such a
[30:41] report that God
[30:45] himself shows you off to the
[30:48] devil tells the devil to his
[30:52] face have you
[30:55] considered my servant
[30:58] Jacob hob Josh Josh
[31:03] brother have you considered my
[31:07] servant there's none in the land that's
[31:10] like
[31:11] him he is a one of a
[31:14] kind and God already knew the heart of
[31:20] job God knows the heart of his
[31:25] people and God starts to allow the
[31:30] devil to deconstruct job's physical
[31:37] life just so that God can turn
[31:42] around and prove to
[31:45] Satan that I still have a faithful
[31:48] servant and that type is still right
[31:53] now that God has a
[31:56] bride who is still
[31:59] faithful who loves
[32:01] him and serves him in the good and in
[32:06] the
[32:08] bad and how amazing it
[32:11] is that the devil as he starts to pick
[32:14] off things in in job's
[32:19] life first he starts with The
[32:24] Oxen some thieves come by and steal the
[32:26] o
[32:29] and the servants that were with them
[32:31] they're slayed By The
[32:35] Sword and one escapes to come and run
[32:37] and tell
[32:40] job as that servant's finishing up
[32:42] telling job the
[32:46] tragedy another comes
[32:48] along oh your sheep they've been burned
[32:51] by fire Sent From
[32:55] Heaven and your servants all burned
[32:59] up and as that servant's done telling
[33:03] him another one comes
[33:06] Running Oh master your your
[33:10] camel they've been
[33:13] taken and the servants watching over
[33:15] them slayed By The
[33:19] Sword and if that wasn't
[33:24] enough the devil goes after his children
[33:29] the Bible says a strong wind
[33:34] came and broke all the corners of the
[33:36] house that they were
[33:42] in now can you
[33:46] imagine the type of Crisis this creates
[33:49] in his
[33:52] life you know job could have at this
[33:55] time he he could have started to testify
[33:58] about the
[34:01] devil if I can put it that
[34:05] way he could have testified about the
[34:07] devil and what he was doing in his
[34:12] life but watch the first thing that he
[34:14] says in the
[34:17] scriptures job
[34:19] 120 he says then job arose and rent his
[34:23] mantle and shaved his head and fell down
[34:26] upon on the ground and
[34:34] worship and you're telling me in such a
[34:37] time of of
[34:40] testing in such a time of
[34:44] stress
[34:47] heartache
[34:49] despair
[34:51] suffering I can't even begin to
[34:55] imagine the things that job was
[34:59] feeling not just losing your
[35:04] possessions but your
[35:06] family all of them your
[35:10] children you know I I I I know people in
[35:13] my
[35:14] life who have lost
[35:18] children and the way that they've
[35:20] expressed how they
[35:23] felt I can't even begin to identify
[35:29] that kind of a
[35:31] suffering imagine the the the mental
[35:35] stress that that puts a person
[35:39] through not just a loved one but a
[35:44] child and
[35:46] job he
[35:50] worships job gets down and worships
[35:54] God now I don't know about you but I
[35:58] would have really
[36:02] enjoyed seeing the look on Satan's
[36:06] face and I took all his
[36:10] possessions I took all his
[36:13] camel I took all his
[36:16] Ox I took his
[36:18] sheep I killed all his
[36:21] servants and left him
[36:24] one just to come back and tell him what
[36:26] had happened to the
[36:30] others and I even took his
[36:33] children and yet here he
[36:36] is still giving God the
[36:40] praise what a
[36:42] testimony for me as an
[36:46] individual to look at the life of
[36:49] Job who suffers what he
[36:52] suffered and still gives God the
[36:55] praise he
[36:58] automatically gives God the
[37:01] praise he left no no opinion to the
[37:04] devil to say oh the devil's doing this
[37:06] to
[37:11] me verse 21 he says and naked came I out
[37:15] of my mother's womb and naked shall I
[37:17] return thither the lord gave and the
[37:20] Lord had taken away blessed be the name
[37:23] of the
[37:25] Lord
[37:34] and all this job sin not nor charged God
[37:43] foolishly it can be too easy
[37:49] sometimes that when we're faced with a
[37:53] trial and hard times come our way
[37:58] we automatically
[38:01] say oh it must be that
[38:05] devil trying to torment
[38:09] me oh I can never catch a break with
[38:11] that devil on my
[38:14] back no give God the
[38:19] praise don't testify about the
[38:22] devil bad times come Hard Times come
[38:28] stop and worship
[38:30] God you know that'll throw the devil for
[38:32] a
[38:37] loop trying to mess with
[38:40] you trying to get into your
[38:44] mind when he sees you stop and give God
[38:49] glory he's really going to stop and
[38:51] question
[38:53] himself he might even stop and say
[38:57] I don't know what to do with
[38:59] them no matter what I throw with
[39:02] them no matter how hard I make their
[39:06] life they just keep giving God
[39:10] praise and the devil will start to
[39:13] say that I can never catch a
[39:17] break why can't I anger that
[39:20] brother can't I anger that
[39:23] sister why can't I cause confusion
[39:28] disorder in Jero
[39:31] Tabernacle man they're all just so close
[39:33] with
[39:34] God I can't even get in
[39:39] between that's what that devil ought to
[39:41] be
[39:43] saying now we can
[39:46] imagine the amount of
[39:50] tension being put on job's
[39:54] life brother brandham says here in the
[39:56] uniting time and
[40:03] sign it says that some people tries to
[40:06] introduce Christianity that you're free
[40:09] from
[40:15] worry the prophet says no you're
[40:20] not no you're
[40:24] not Christianity
[40:29] me professing that I'm a
[40:30] [Music]
[40:32] Christian it does not free me from the
[40:34] Troubles of this
[40:38] world it isn't an automatic Shield that
[40:41] comes
[40:43] up oh Satan I profess
[40:47] Christianity can't touch me I'm a
[40:50] Christian you know what the devil don't
[40:52] care about
[40:54] titles anybody body can profess
[40:59] Christianity but it'll take a true
[41:01] Christian to live
[41:03] it true Christian to live
[41:07] it now we're not free from troubles and
[41:13] trials does not mean that Christians are
[41:18] miserable Nei should we be
[41:22] miserable I don't know about
[41:25] you me
[41:27] personally I do not know any miserable
[41:32] Christians those two
[41:34] words do not belong in the same
[41:38] sentence when I'm describing a
[41:41] Christian you cannot be a true
[41:45] Christian and be
[41:47] miserable no there will be hard
[41:51] times but we have God to get us through
[41:53] hard
[41:55] times and not trying to discourage
[42:00] anybody from being a
[42:02] Christian don't walk out of here today
[42:04] and
[42:05] say man brother Nick said it's it's
[42:09] tough being a
[42:11] Christian I don't know if I want to be a
[42:13] Christian
[42:15] now I don't if I want to serve God
[42:19] now life is just way too
[42:22] hard you know what comes with being a
[42:25] Christian
[42:27] there's this deep sweet
[42:32] peace there's joy
[42:35] unspeakable there's so much
[42:39] satisfaction found in Christ
[42:42] Jesus that you cannot find anywhere
[42:46] else only in Christ
[42:50] Jesus the prophet here
[42:54] says you're free from tension
[42:56] oh
[43:00] no he says you add tension when you
[43:03] become a
[43:06] Christian who here saying sign me
[43:09] up give me some of that
[43:13] tension he says because you was kind of
[43:16] a slop Go Happy gol lucky whatever it
[43:20] was out there not caring what you
[43:25] did
[43:34] he says but when you've become a real
[43:36] Christian every moment you're wondering
[43:39] am I pleasing my
[43:48] Lord every
[43:50] day every
[43:52] moment a Christian wakes up
[43:56] a true
[43:57] Christian I will say
[44:00] Lord how can I please you
[44:03] today how can I serve you
[44:07] Lord what can I
[44:09] do to be pleasing before you
[44:14] God
[44:16] am a real a real Christian asks
[44:21] that am I pleasing the
[44:25] Lord he doesn't say oh am I pleasing the
[44:30] pastor or I've got to please the
[44:34] deacons oh no I've got to please the
[44:39] musicians I've got to please the
[44:42] ministry oh I've got to please my mom
[44:45] and
[44:47] dad no but am I first pleasing
[44:52] God I was given a a piece of advice one
[44:55] time
[44:58] by a loved
[45:00] one she told
[45:02] me when I wake up in the
[45:07] morning I look in the
[45:11] mirror and I ask the
[45:14] Lord Lord is what I'm wearing
[45:20] pleasing not to the eye of
[45:23] man but to you Lord
[45:27] and these are the questions that we
[45:28] should ask
[45:30] ourselves Lord is my life pleasing
[45:33] before
[45:35] you Lord are you are you pleased with
[45:38] the direction my life is going
[45:44] in are you pleased with who I associate
[45:47] myself
[45:50] with the kind of friends I choose to
[45:53] hang out with at
[45:54] work
[45:57] typ crowds I choose to be
[46:02] around Lord are you are you pleased with
[46:05] the way I
[46:07] talk do I do I talk real nice in front
[46:11] of the church
[46:14] people and then when I get home I talk
[46:17] like a
[46:19] devil do we always ask God in or around
[46:24] people
[46:26] Lord is my speech pleasing to
[46:31] you you know or do we do we still carry
[46:34] the habits of the one little cuss word
[46:36] that we can't get rid
[46:39] of a little tiny one that seems real
[46:45] inconspicuous it's it's it's just you
[46:47] know I throw it in every little joke
[46:49] because it's kind of
[46:52] funny do we stop and ask God
[46:57] God was that pleasing to
[47:04] you and I ask myself the
[47:08] question as we should ask ourselves the
[47:12] question if we profess
[47:16] Christianity Lord is there enough
[47:18] tension on
[47:22] me to get me in the position
[47:27] that you need me to be
[47:30] in is there enough pressure on
[47:34] me is life too easy and I'm just
[47:37] breezing
[47:39] by not caring about anything of the
[47:44] Lord show The church here and
[47:47] there or is there real pressure on my
[47:52] life causing me to always want to be in
[47:56] the house of the
[47:58] Lord at our posts of
[48:01] Duty in and outside of
[48:07] church continuing here the prophet
[48:10] says if I could hear from
[48:14] him it puts you on tension puts you on
[48:19] guard that's what makes you what you
[48:23] are so after all
[48:27] and praise God for this right
[48:30] here he said tension is a
[48:36] blessing I need that
[48:39] tension it's a blessing in my
[48:42] life you know that might sound crazy to
[48:44] the
[48:46] world do you think the denominations
[48:49] preach
[48:51] that do you think they
[48:53] say Hey you better if you're going to
[48:56] serve God there's going to be
[49:00] tension no they preach the Prosperity
[49:04] Gospel Brothers God's
[49:07] love oh God's just
[49:10] love God isn't just
[49:13] love God is not just
[49:16] love put tension on the true
[49:20] Christian it molds
[49:23] people it makes car
[49:27] that's what comes from
[49:29] it I need tension in my
[49:32] life
[49:34] God that's what helps
[49:36] me to get into my
[49:40] position it helps us to get into our
[49:44] position who knew that
[49:47] tension the one thing that pulls on
[49:51] you stretches on
[49:54] you could be one one thing that God
[49:58] uses to draw you
[50:00] in
[50:03] amen continuing here he says it's just
[50:05] the way you're looking at it
[50:09] see if you just look the other side no
[50:12] matter how thin you slice
[50:19] anything you still got two sides to it
[50:22] see so you want to see both sides
[50:28] so tension I
[50:34] think he says oh my what's this
[50:40] tension if I could have been born
[50:43] without this
[50:47] tension well if I wouldn't have had this
[50:50] tension I wouldn't have been what I
[50:54] am
[50:57] I
[50:59] wouldn't I wouldn't have been a
[51:02] Christian
[51:05] perhaps wow thank God for
[51:09] tension it was this tension that drove
[51:12] me to Jesus Christ
[51:15] see so it's been a blessing thing to
[51:20] me you know I have a completely
[51:23] different outlook on tension now
[51:28] I don't see tension the same way
[51:31] anymore see tension the same way
[51:35] anymore when hard times
[51:38] come Trials come when I think that I
[51:41] can't make it
[51:44] through I can't help but just look at
[51:47] God turn my head up to
[51:50] God and say Lord it must be
[51:54] you
[51:55] producing this tension in my
[51:58] life because maybe you see something
[52:00] that I
[52:02] can't and sometimes that's how it
[52:06] is we can't see what God's doing in our
[52:10] Liv sometimes I want to take the RS and
[52:13] oh Lord let me I want to do
[52:15] this Lord I'm GNA go this
[52:18] way I'm going to take this
[52:21] turn have that path set for me but
[52:23] that's that's not for me
[52:26] and God puts
[52:28] attention and God sets you
[52:30] straight and God puts you on the right
[52:34] path but we need that
[52:37] tension it's a
[52:39] blessing and often times it's a blessing
[52:41] in
[52:44] disguise and it's in Disguise because
[52:47] sometimes we can't even see
[52:50] it and God's trying to tell us something
[52:53] right in front of my face
[52:56] I'm trying to direct
[52:58] you quit pushing quit
[53:02] pulling quit trying to lead your
[53:05] way just let me be the
[53:08] center let me mold you and form
[53:11] you I need the
[53:18] attention there so then as Paul said as
[53:22] though when he had tension or something
[53:24] or another and
[53:28] he had consulted the Lord consulted the
[53:31] Lord to take away from him three
[53:38] times and the Lord
[53:41] said Paul my grace is
[53:45] sufficient oh my grace is
[53:48] sufficient he said then I'll glory in my
[53:54] infirmities
[53:56] then when I'm weak I'm
[54:00] strong see as long as it's in the will
[54:02] of God
[54:05] right and you know some may
[54:09] question why would God
[54:13] allow a man like
[54:16] job to go through something like that he
[54:19] went
[54:22] through I believe that it was necessary
[54:24] to
[54:27] it was
[54:29] needed and we as the Believers we need
[54:32] tension on
[54:35] us no I I don't I don't want it
[54:39] easy let me explain
[54:41] that you know we can complain to God oh
[54:44] Lord make my life
[54:47] easy that
[54:49] molding
[54:51] conforming it comes from tensions and
[54:54] pressures on the
[54:57] life and that's how God molds us and
[55:00] forms our
[55:04] character and God often reveals
[55:07] himself in
[55:09] trials and in hard
[55:13] times but look at job
[55:17] here look how he
[55:21] response right in the middle of his
[55:24] turmoil
[55:27] he Praises God by
[55:31] saying the Lord gives and the lord
[55:33] taketh
[55:37] away blessed be the name of the
[55:41] Lord God puts on tensions in our lives
[55:44] for a
[55:48] reason the word of God here
[55:53] says in Hebrews 125
[55:58] 5 and ye have forgotten the exhortation
[56:01] which speaketh unto you as unto children
[56:04] my son despise not thou the chastening
[56:08] of the Lord nor faint when thou are
[56:11] rebuked of
[56:23] him for whom the Lord loveth he
[56:27] chasteneth and scth every son who he
[56:37] receiveth if he endure chastening God
[56:40] dealth with you as with sons for what
[56:43] son is he whom the father chasteneth
[56:53] not praise God for
[56:56] that that's the tension that's on the
[57:00] believer especially in this end
[57:05] time you know the devil the devil never
[57:07] fights
[57:09] you when you're not reading
[57:14] praying but when we do want to
[57:17] read and pray and get alone with
[57:21] God find some peace
[57:25] or when we want to start coming to
[57:28] church we find all of a
[57:31] sudden every
[57:35] circumstance that could ever have
[57:38] happened everything that was ever
[57:41] wrong that could have ever
[57:45] happened
[57:48] happens and it tries to pull us away
[57:50] from
[57:52] God remember the next time
[57:56] time that's that
[57:58] tension I'm trying to get close to
[58:02] God and here comes this
[58:05] trial Here Comes This whatever it may be
[58:08] that tries to pull me from
[58:10] God no I'm not going to give the the
[58:13] devil any
[58:15] Glory I'm G to give God all the
[58:18] praise keep on moving
[58:21] forward amen
[58:23] amen
[58:25] and we get
[58:27] busy we make
[58:31] excuses we'll dig for reasons not to
[58:34] come to
[58:36] church and boid does the devil just give
[58:39] us the
[58:42] reasons he give us the reasons to not
[58:45] read or pray oh you're
[58:49] tired oh just lay
[58:52] down just take a nap
[58:56] you've had a very long day work was
[58:59] stressful
[59:00] today you are dealing with so and
[59:03] so and this was happening and that was
[59:07] happening just rest your eyes for 30
[59:11] minutes 30 minutes turns into an
[59:14] hour that turns into two hours that
[59:17] turns into three
[59:18] hours before we know it
[59:22] wow I'll just read my Bible pray
[59:27] later you
[59:29] know faith is a really simple thing if
[59:32] we just stop and look at
[59:37] it and you know if we would read and
[59:40] pray
[59:44] more just reading and
[59:48] praying just those two things
[59:52] alone they open up doors
[59:56] for God to start to do things in our
[1:00:00] lives and you know what you don't have
[1:00:02] to sit down and tell
[1:00:05] yourself well man I well I I can't just
[1:00:08] read for 10 minutes you
[1:00:11] know I got to read for an
[1:00:14] hour to feel like I'm a good
[1:00:17] Christian know if there's a hungering
[1:00:19] and a desire in your
[1:00:21] life to read or to pray
[1:00:25] if you tell
[1:00:26] God you know what Lord today I'm going
[1:00:29] to give you five
[1:00:31] minutes I'm going to open up that bible
[1:00:33] and I'm going to
[1:00:34] read and the more hungrier and hungrier
[1:00:37] you
[1:00:38] get the more longer you'll stay in that
[1:00:41] Bible the longer you stay on your
[1:00:44] knees you care about the
[1:00:47] time you'll start to have a relationship
[1:00:50] with
[1:00:52] God that the devil can't even put a
[1:00:54] razor blade in
[1:00:57] between I can't I can't touch that
[1:01:01] Christian they're so in love with God I
[1:01:04] don't know what to do with
[1:01:07] them but there's going to be some
[1:01:10] tensions and that's
[1:01:14] okay breathe
[1:01:16] easy tell
[1:01:18] yourself it's
[1:01:21] okay if there are tensions in my life
[1:01:26] God must be trying to tell me
[1:01:29] something or direct me from the path
[1:01:32] that I'm going
[1:01:35] in I better start listening more
[1:01:40] closely I better start getting closer to
[1:01:45] God this might be
[1:01:48] God talking to
[1:01:51] me you know before I I came here this
[1:01:53] weekend
[1:01:56] you know I was I was so busy with
[1:02:01] work and I was trying to get on the road
[1:02:03] and and get over
[1:02:07] here and and I was I was over here in
[1:02:10] Chandler with my company they had me
[1:02:12] doing some
[1:02:16] training brother Eli I started telling
[1:02:18] you this
[1:02:20] brother I was driving on the
[1:02:23] road just
[1:02:25] rushing I got to I got to hurry up now I
[1:02:27] got to get out of
[1:02:29] here I I got everything I I got my bags
[1:02:33] I I got my work
[1:02:35] laptop I'm going through my
[1:02:40] checklist and then the thought hits
[1:02:44] me I forgot my
[1:02:48] Bible and I'm halfway out of
[1:02:52] town I'm thinking to
[1:02:56] myself you know what I'll I'll get it
[1:02:59] next
[1:03:02] time would have been too
[1:03:04] easy I'll get it next
[1:03:07] time surely brother oron isn't going to
[1:03:10] kick me out if I don't come with my
[1:03:14] Bible he'll forgive me I'll remember at
[1:03:17] the next
[1:03:20] trip and before the brother had asked me
[1:03:23] to speak
[1:03:27] tonight I didn't know that that was
[1:03:29] gonna happen at the
[1:03:31] time and something pulled on
[1:03:35] me Nick turn
[1:03:38] around you're going to kill 45 minutes
[1:03:41] having to turn around and get your
[1:03:43] Bible that's
[1:03:45] okay so get your
[1:03:48] Bible and while you're at it get your
[1:03:50] notes because you never know what's
[1:03:53] going to happen this weekend
[1:03:55] and I did not show up with the
[1:03:57] expectation to preach
[1:04:01] tonight I would never invite myself to
[1:04:04] speak at this Pulpit
[1:04:08] brother I do not believe in
[1:04:10] that I feel that that should be
[1:04:12] something from the church that pulls on
[1:04:15] somebody not meting myself oh brother
[1:04:19] hey put me to preach
[1:04:21] brother brother I'm a good Preacher
[1:04:23] Brother
[1:04:25] come on put me to preach
[1:04:26] brother have a good
[1:04:28] time
[1:04:30] no and for whatever
[1:04:35] reason before this had even
[1:04:38] happened something
[1:04:40] else told me Nick Nick usually when you
[1:04:44] leave on your work
[1:04:46] trips you don't take a suit and a tie
[1:04:49] with
[1:04:51] you but pack one
[1:04:53] anyways
[1:04:56] you know something was pulling on
[1:04:58] me all
[1:05:00] along to line things
[1:05:04] up and when all this had
[1:05:07] happened and brother Eli told
[1:05:10] me asked me if I would
[1:05:13] speak I could not say
[1:05:16] no because I already felt the
[1:05:19] pool there was already a tension on
[1:05:22] me and I believe that that was
[1:05:25] God and you might look at that and say
[1:05:28] well Nick that's that's not really a big
[1:05:29] great
[1:05:32] story have
[1:05:34] faith that that was God talking to
[1:05:37] me and I want to give all that glory to
[1:05:42] God God has some wonderful ways of
[1:05:44] dealing with
[1:05:50] people you know I was thinking about
[1:05:53] tension
[1:05:55] forgive
[1:06:03] me I was thinking about
[1:06:06] tension and I was thinking about
[1:06:09] something that compared to
[1:06:12] it and one of my favorite things came to
[1:06:17] mind um
[1:06:20] music more uh particularly the piano
[1:06:25] particular and I started thinking about
[1:06:29] tension that every one of those strings
[1:06:31] on that
[1:06:34] piano it has to have a certain amount of
[1:06:37] tension on
[1:06:39] it it has to have
[1:06:43] enough to
[1:06:45] produce not just a
[1:06:48] sound but the correct
[1:06:51] sound it has to be tuned in in the right
[1:06:57] way and those
[1:06:59] strings if they have a loose tension to
[1:07:03] them they can have a loose tension to
[1:07:07] them but that does not mean that it's
[1:07:09] the right
[1:07:11] tension or the right
[1:07:15] tuning and that
[1:07:18] piano if it's All Out Of
[1:07:21] Tune I don't care how how good of a
[1:07:24] Pianist you
[1:07:26] are it'll never sound like it was meant
[1:07:31] to it has to have the right tuning to
[1:07:36] it those strings have to be pulled on in
[1:07:39] such a
[1:07:41] way produce the correct
[1:07:45] sound and I started to think well that's
[1:07:47] a tension right
[1:07:49] there that made me think about the true
[1:07:52] Christian
[1:07:56] there's a certain
[1:07:58] tension that comes with being a true
[1:08:01] Christian or a son and daughter of
[1:08:06] God and if we hold that
[1:08:10] tension and keeping that
[1:08:14] key stay in tune with God's
[1:08:20] word we'll find that
[1:08:22] God
[1:08:24] he has people all
[1:08:28] over a multi-member
[1:08:33] bride many different
[1:08:36] bodies many different
[1:08:40] tensions and we as the body of
[1:08:45] Christ we represent the
[1:08:48] tension we represent the strings on that
[1:08:52] piano
[1:08:54] and if everybody's in
[1:08:57] tune and all the right
[1:09:00] tension is in the right
[1:09:06] places we find that
[1:09:09] God on his great
[1:09:12] piano the chief
[1:09:15] musician when he strikes those
[1:09:18] keys it brings forth the correct
[1:09:22] sound
[1:09:24] but it has to be the correct
[1:09:27] sound it has to be the right
[1:09:32] tuning be the correct
[1:09:35] tension the right
[1:09:39] pressures and I'm not asking
[1:09:42] you to say
[1:09:45] Lord Oh Lord start giving me trials
[1:09:48] Lord Oh Lord you know I need trials in
[1:09:51] my
[1:09:52] life
[1:09:54] I don't know what kind of a Christian
[1:09:55] asks for
[1:09:56] that we don't ask for the
[1:09:59] trials but when we tell
[1:10:02] God lord Draw Me
[1:10:05] Close Lord I just want to be close to
[1:10:09] you you better be careful when you tell
[1:10:11] God
[1:10:12] that because that means that there may
[1:10:15] be some tension that's
[1:10:17] coming there might mean that there's
[1:10:19] some hard times that are
[1:10:22] coming the
[1:10:25] road is going to
[1:10:27] come and you're going to need to have
[1:10:29] the right tension in your
[1:10:33] life you're need to be on the right
[1:10:38] foundation if we watch
[1:10:40] that it's just God molding our
[1:10:45] character to be more like
[1:10:47] him and praise God for
[1:10:50] that because if there's anything ever in
[1:10:52] my life
[1:10:55] that I ever want to
[1:10:56] do or ever want to
[1:10:59] achieve it's not owning a millions of
[1:11:04] dollars or becoming the
[1:11:07] wealthiest having a big mansion here on
[1:11:10] Earth it isn't all this in that dream
[1:11:16] job oh Lord or let me travel the world
[1:11:19] and see this and
[1:11:22] that materialist
[1:11:26] things it's just
[1:11:28] God I want you to live in
[1:11:31] me that when the world sees
[1:11:34] me they see
[1:11:36] you that
[1:11:38] Nick his old nature is
[1:11:41] dead he's gone no more of
[1:11:45] him I don't want to see him I don't want
[1:11:49] to catch a glimpse of that
[1:11:52] guy the Mir
[1:11:55] I don't want to see none of
[1:11:57] him Lord I just want to see your
[1:12:00] reflection if there's ever anything that
[1:12:03] I can
[1:12:05] accomplish it's just to be your
[1:12:09] reflection that's it
[1:12:11] Lord I don't want all the Treasures of
[1:12:14] the
[1:12:15] world cuz we're not taking them with us
[1:12:18] when we
[1:12:21] go none of them
[1:12:26] you know I found
[1:12:29] out I found out that a a concert grand
[1:12:35] piano very it's a very big and expensive
[1:12:40] piano I found out that
[1:12:44] the these
[1:12:48] pianos have somewhere near 30 tons of
[1:12:52] pressure
[1:12:57] on it
[1:13:00] frame 30 tons of
[1:13:04] pressure that is a lot of
[1:13:08] tension that's pulling on that
[1:13:12] frame and that made me think of the body
[1:13:14] of
[1:13:16] Christ we are God's Great
[1:13:20] piano and he has us tuned to such a
[1:13:23] certain
[1:13:26] way he wants to play us in such a
[1:13:28] certain
[1:13:30] way for his honor and His
[1:13:34] glory not to the tune that I
[1:13:37] want not to what I think sounds
[1:13:42] good but Lord to what you
[1:13:45] want it it's God bringing out
[1:13:51] Beauty from the tensions and pressures
[1:13:54] in our
[1:13:56] lives to give him the
[1:13:59] glory you
[1:14:01] know God didn't have
[1:14:04] to God didn't have to tell the story of
[1:14:08] job I'm certainly glad he
[1:14:12] did but God being
[1:14:14] God he could have just looked into the
[1:14:17] heart of
[1:14:19] job
[1:14:21] known that that's my fa ful
[1:14:24] servant and there's none like
[1:14:27] him and that could have been enough for
[1:14:31] God pleas seeing the heart of
[1:14:36] job but God wanted to bring out of
[1:14:39] job that
[1:14:41] tension oh that
[1:14:44] beauty so that you and me one
[1:14:47] day I can open up this
[1:14:50] Bible and when I don't know why there's
[1:14:52] trials
[1:14:54] hard times on
[1:14:56] me I can be
[1:14:59] encouraged and lift it
[1:15:01] up by reading the story of
[1:15:05] job that Lord that's me
[1:15:08] too Lord though you slay
[1:15:11] me I will love
[1:15:14] you no matter
[1:15:17] what we just want to give God the glory
