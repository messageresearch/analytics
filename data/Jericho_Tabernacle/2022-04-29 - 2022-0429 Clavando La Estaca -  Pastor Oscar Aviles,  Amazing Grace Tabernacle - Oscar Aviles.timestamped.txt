[35:40] great honor immediately
[35:45] and i didn't even know i was going to
[35:47] have this privilege tonight
[35:52] i wanted to come and sit and worship
[35:53] with you anyway
[35:59] i want to read the scripture okay
[36:03] and it's found in luke chapter 2 esta
[36:06] lucas el capitolo and i believe it's
[36:08] verse 8.
[36:12] and there were in the same country
[36:14] shepherds abiding in the field keeping
[36:17] watch over their flock by night
[36:19] pastors
[36:25] and the angel of the lord came upon them
[36:27] and the glory of the lord shone around
[36:29] about them and they were sore afraid
[36:38] and the angel of the lord said unto them
[36:41] fear not for behold i bring you good
[36:44] tidings of great joy which shall be
[36:47] to all people
[36:52] new
[36:56] is born this day in the city of david
[36:58] the savior which is christ the lord
[37:07] and this shall be a sign unto you
[37:10] ye shall find the babe wrapped in
[37:12] swaddling clothes lying in a manger esto
[37:15] o servirada signal agares el nino in
[37:18] bulton
[37:21] now i want to skip on down to verse 17.
[37:26] and they and when they had seen it
[37:30] they made known abroad the saying which
[37:33] was told them concerning
[37:43] i was thinking of the great message that
[37:45] the prophet of god preached entitled why
[37:48] it had to be shepherds
[37:54] and i wanted to say this in honor of our
[37:57] pastor tonight
[38:01] he has certainly displayed the spirit of
[38:04] christ to me as i had just the brief
[38:06] opportunity to meet him
[38:15] if you'll notice he says
[38:25] the first ones to know that the messiah
[38:28] was on the earth was pastors los
[38:42] because the shepherds know how to tend
[38:45] to and feed the sheep
[38:49] the bible says that they made this
[38:52] uh this event and this uh
[38:56] message that they had received this
[38:58] angelic message
[39:06] they ran with this message
[39:09] they made this message known abroad
[39:15] but two years later when the wise men
[39:18] arrived in jerusalem
[39:23] nobody knew where the messiah was
[39:39] and the world failed to recognize the
[39:42] first announcement of the messiah
[39:48] that same messiah is here again tonight
[39:53] amen amen
[39:54] oh my brother my sister ivaya hermano
[39:58] herman the prophet of god said the gates
[40:00] of hell are not against your
[40:02] denominations
[40:07] the gates of hell are not just against
[40:18] it's against the revelation of jesus
[40:21] christ being here
[40:54] ministry made known through malachi 4.

[49:53] and he said let me go for the day
[49:55] breaketh and he said i will not let you
[49:57] go except thou bless me.
[50:04] and he said unto him what is thy name
[50:05] and he said jacob
[50:17] and he said thy name shall be called no
[50:19] more jacob but israel for as a prince
[50:21] has thou power with god and with men and
[50:24] has prevailed
[50:35] and jacob asked him and said tell me i
[50:37] pray thee thy name and he said wherefore
[50:39] is it that thou asked after my name and
[50:41] he blessed him there
[50:44] juan says
[50:46] we'll go to now john 6 37
[50:51] todd
[50:58] all that the father giveth me shall come
[51:00] to me and him that cometh to me i will
[51:02] in no wise cast out

[52:17] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[52:19] amen amen
[52:22] you may be seated brothers
[52:29] i called the message this way brothers
[52:36] i'm going to tell you a testimony that
[52:38] for me is very great
[52:44] i was under the weather i was sick
[52:50] uh ever since december i started having
[52:52] an issue uh yesterday
[52:55] i ended up being hospitalized
[52:59] and then some months went on
[53:03] and i couldn't feel my healing
[53:07] and i was really struggling
[53:12] the doctors they would check my heart
[53:15] and he said that my heart was in a bad
[53:17] condition
[53:19] my blood pressure was too high
[53:23] and i felt that that wasn't true
[53:55] an ex an exhaustion
[53:58] there were some times that i couldn't
[53:59] even speak
[54:01] i couldn't even preach nothing
[54:04] i had no strength
[54:06] i couldn't even speak brothers
[54:23] um
[54:24] for me and my brothers would pray for me
[54:29] for me some of you noticed what was
[54:30] happening and started praying for me
[54:35] within myself i was already
[54:42] i felt that there was nothing good that
[54:44] was going on with him
[54:47] as time went on i kept getting worse
[54:51] libras i lost actually 26 pounds
[54:56] and it was such a tremendous thing that
[54:57] was going on with me india and then
[54:59] finally one day
[55:01] i told my wife
[55:04] that i was going to go pray at the
[55:05] church
[55:08] and i told her i'm not coming back
[55:12] until god does something for me
[55:16] and tonight i want you to listen estamos
[55:26] and we're believing that tonight god
[55:27] will do something for you
[55:30] and i believe that god is here
[55:45] that's because he is here
[55:54] [Applause]
[55:56] at seven o'clock in the evening i went
[55:58] inside the church
[56:00] and i was praying
[56:02] i felt so bad
[56:05] i had no strength
[56:07] and my blood pressure skyrocketed in the
[56:09] pain
[56:11] it was so severe
[56:28] i said lord i'm not leaving this place
[56:30] you either heal me or take me
[56:32] and brother jacob
[56:36] had such a determination
[56:39] he knew that he was being persecuted
[56:42] he knew
[57:10] and he said i'm
[57:47] [Music]
[57:51] and he began to have some things
[57:54] he said that this man was uh driving
[57:56] down a stake
[57:58] and he said lord
[58:00] lord if you don't do something for me
[58:05] when you come you're gonna find a bunch
[58:07] of dry bones here
[58:10] he had such a determination
[58:12] brother said that god blessed him
[58:16] and if you did that back then
[58:18] he can do the same today with you
[58:26] and then it came to three o'clock in the
[58:28] morning
[58:30] and i felt pretty car to preach
[58:34] i
[58:44] and you know that the angels of the lord
[58:46] encounters around those that fear him
[59:30] god's
[59:42] i said lord i know your angels are here
[1:00:13] and at three in the morning i began to
[1:00:15] preach to them
[1:00:17] and then i began to pray
[1:00:20] at 4 40 in the morning
[1:00:23] i remembered that testimony
[1:00:40] yesterday today and
[1:01:08] if you don't come and
[1:01:34] every child of god is tested
[1:02:04] we're believing that he's
[1:02:17] and the greater the problem is
[1:02:32] that a minute longer and i was gone
[1:02:35] but you know what
[1:02:37] iglesia i came to church
[1:02:39] to drive down the stake
[1:02:42] bro god performed
[1:03:01] that enemy came once again
[1:03:04] i got worse just like i did it in the
[1:03:06] beginning
[1:03:09] and then i remember the testimony that
[1:03:10] brother bannon gives
[1:03:13] us
[1:03:14] and that
[1:03:27] [Applause]

[1:04:48] quotes of the message
[1:04:58] sometimes i read them sometimes i don't

[1:05:06] he gets different types of preachers all
[1:05:08] the time
[1:05:12] and he says if i'm going too fast for
[1:05:14] you just let me know

[1:11:13] that they can go under a man
[1:11:16] and learn from him
[1:11:20] brother banham says that for like a year
[1:11:22] and a half he went with him
[1:11:24] and tommy osborne was with the brother
[1:11:27] for a year and a half

[1:12:06] telling you
[1:12:26] is someone here that wants to taste from
[1:12:28] god
[1:12:29] come forward
[1:12:30] and come forward
[1:12:32] come forward
[1:13:02] but this is
[1:13:28] is
[1:13:44] say it
[1:14:24] praise god
[1:14:29] [Music]
[1:14:40] until god
[1:15:32] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:15:35] in the name of jesus christ receive
[1:15:50] don't
[1:15:55] [Music]
[1:16:15] [Applause]
[1:17:13] you're not coming to the prison
[1:17:55] every one of the prophets
[1:18:10] that he told his wife
[1:18:24] and i'm not coming
[1:18:45] and the fortune tellers will say brother
[1:18:46] branham you were born under a sign
[1:18:49] the scripture itself
[1:18:51] when paul was walking
[1:20:26] from seven o'clock in the evening to 4
[1:20:27] 40. the next day in the morning and i
[1:20:29] was perfectly fine
[1:20:43] i had to drive down the street
[1:21:12] if
[1:21:24] it's a matter of you wanting it
[1:21:51] [Music]
[1:21:59] then you have to be willing to stay with
[1:22:01] god to meet him face to face
[1:22:04] not just a fantasy no no no no
[1:22:06] see it's not just saying oh okay
[1:22:38] and there had to be a stop
[1:22:41] when you're willing
[1:22:44] when you're truly willing brothers
[1:22:47] to have an encounter with god
[1:23:04] we need him to
[1:23:18] the time has come
[1:24:01] a mistake along the way
[1:24:03] it says lord forgive me
[1:24:06] if this is the spirit of the devil
[1:24:09] i don't want to have it
[1:24:12] i don't want it lord
[1:24:17] remember the religious man was telling
[1:24:19] billy get away from that
[1:24:22] but when he had an encounter
[1:24:25] he says that god's angel came in
[1:24:27] at three o'clock in the morning
[1:24:42] oh just a little while longer i'll do it
[1:24:44] tomorrow
[1:24:46] but at three in the morning
[1:24:48] get up and pray
[1:24:49] when you can't sleep
[1:24:53] don't say lord help me to sleep when you
[1:24:55] can't sleep
[1:25:10] get
[1:25:25] [Music]
[1:25:34] and on a regular basis when he gives the
[1:25:35] testimony it's because he had an
[1:25:37] encounter with it
[1:25:38] one time
[1:25:54] he says go with him but you're going to
[1:25:55] suffer the consequences
[1:25:58] that he went
[1:26:00] and when he goes
[1:26:02] he gets sick in his stomach
[1:26:46] he said that the angel of the lord came
[1:26:48] to him
[1:27:02] go and
[1:27:16] said
[1:27:30] and
[1:27:44] i don't want to be the same
[1:27:57] i want to come and worship you lord
[1:28:26] how many are tied down
[1:28:39] today
[1:28:54] if you're just going to be a spectator
[1:28:59] you do that at the funeral seriously
[1:29:01] you're just serious
[1:29:04] this is a party a feast
[1:29:06] he's alive
[1:29:32] [Applause]
[1:29:36] who
[1:29:44] [Applause]
[1:29:50] and say that we
[1:29:51] [Applause]
[1:30:01] do you think you worship at your house
[1:30:06] if you don't worship at the church much
[1:30:07] less where no one sees you
[1:30:10] that's true
[1:30:32] that's why you see me the way i am
[1:30:35] brother you're really crazy
[1:30:38] preaching at three in the morning and
[1:30:40] there's no one there i don't know about
[1:30:41] you
[1:30:43] but my eyes have been opened
[1:30:46] there's angels
[1:31:04] [Applause]
[1:31:13] pastor today we're driving down
[1:31:16] when you see things
[1:31:17] [Applause]
[1:31:19] oh brother you didn't drive down the
[1:31:21] stake back then
[1:31:23] check them out
[1:31:28] because when you drive down the stake
[1:31:29] you know what happens
[1:31:31] they no longer cause problems in the
[1:31:32] church
[1:31:33] there's no longer any more issues
[1:31:36] no we would need deacons
[1:31:38] like that oh no amen
[1:31:50] [Music]
[1:32:09] and only just pretended to do it later
[1:32:12] on they're going to say
[1:32:14] oh the sister she said she drove down
[1:32:16] the stake
[1:32:18] that's where the gossip begins
[1:32:21] so then the pastor can say you didn't
[1:32:23] drive down your steak
[1:32:31] they only planted it like this and then
[1:32:33] it fell over you know
[1:32:35] i believe that's
[1:32:37] important
[1:33:06] we
[1:33:20] see what is your reaction
[1:33:23] but i need a real encounter with the
[1:33:24] lord
[1:33:27] because it's just you and god
[1:33:30] the issue i'm the one that's going to
[1:33:32] keep that
[1:33:33] so i have to be really honest with god
[1:33:37] and say lord
[1:33:38] was he missing db well i felt good
[1:33:41] is he missing
[1:33:42] i felt good lord
[1:33:45] but keep giving me that faith lord
[1:33:48] i need that faith
[1:34:16] then demand
[1:34:29] go read the messages
[1:34:44] and the
[1:34:57] he says i want what that man has told me
[1:35:00] and in the campaign
[1:35:03] he should speak the same
[1:35:06] paralytic
[1:35:24] i'll give you the titles of the messages
[1:35:26] because i did say
[1:35:28] from the message from that time on
[1:35:32] the next message early spiritual
[1:35:34] experiences
[1:35:40] the next
[1:35:52] paragraph 64. listen to what he says
[1:36:00] but first we must review genesis to see
[1:36:02] why they were down in egypt
[1:36:06] he says what happened back then was the
[1:36:08] type of what's going on today
[1:36:11] why would god's people be out of the
[1:36:13] land
[1:36:15] now let's bring it to today
[1:36:18] why is it that god's people is outside
[1:36:21] the holy spirit
[1:36:27] but after all god promised that right
[1:36:29] there where the beginning was with
[1:36:31] abraham isaac and jacob in palestine in
[1:36:34] palestine
[1:36:48] why would the people not be in the place
[1:36:50] that god provided them
[1:36:53] why is it that god's people wasn't there
[1:36:56] listen
[1:37:00] that's the question of today
[1:37:47] you can speak a lot with your mouth but
[1:37:49] satan believes in trembles as well
[1:37:52] with your axe you show you don't want it
[1:37:55] you say i i want the lord
[1:37:58] and you still live any kind of life
[1:38:14] why is the church out of it
[1:38:22] why is it that the great christian
[1:38:24] church today living again like the book
[1:38:26] of acts
[1:38:42] and the most terrible condition that
[1:38:43] christianity has ever lived in
