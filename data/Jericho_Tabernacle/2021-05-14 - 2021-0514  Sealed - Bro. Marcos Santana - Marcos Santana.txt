brothers and sisters i'll greet you in the name of the lord jesus christ this evening it is an honor and privilege to be here once again more with the little bit of nerves as always i think brother manuel's probably getting tired of me saying that all the time you know i don't know how you guys have felt over these last two friday services but i've been rejoicing plenty these last two fridays to be able to hear our brother uh gomez a testimony that i could not have ever guessed he went through in his life but you can tell through the words that he was expressing that something has really happened in his life another example like what we try to tell you young people all the time of how it is that you don't need to go out into the world because you come back with those scars and those wounds and those memories that torment you and haunts you yes when the majority of you are like me that were born in a church in this message where we are already in god's family we've been dedicated to the lord that we are awaiting that promise that our parents have been praying upon our lives and then we heard an amazing preaching from my brother what better than to go back to the basics for the young people something i didn't know them the brother grew up as a catholic and even as a catholic raised he was able to open it up and take it step by step for every one of you young people that we might know how to truly pray to god how to truly ask something of god so that in that manner we can actually receive from god and i hope the young people took those notes and they've been applying that prayer in their lives i want to enter into the book of first john chapter 2. and we're going to be reading from verse 1 to verse 5. when you have it in your bibles if you say amen amen first john chapter 2 verse 1 reads my little children these things write i unto you that ye sin not and if any man sinned we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteousness and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments he that saith i know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him but whoso keepeth his word in him verily is the love of god perfected whereby know we that we are in him we bow our heads for word of prayer lord heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for another opportunity to be here once again where you give us that desire to want to come to service to hear of your word once more and the you still provide a place of worship and a place to hear of your word lord this evening these short words that are going to be spoken tonight i asked lord that you would quicken the content for the young people of this tabernacle and for any young person that might be watching via the internet as well all we want father is for the young people to know you more and that they could reach that new birth and get that seal in their lives father whatever stage these young people find themselves in tonight that you might speak to them according to their maturity [Music] we give you all the honor and glory glory we thank you for the reading of the word we ask it all in the name of the lord jesus christ amen you may be seated uh to give this message a title i just wanted to title it a simple one word title the word sealed uh and and as we go on into the message it'll start to make more sense for you as i was reading these five scriptures to myself i see words that i kind of don't understand and i've heard the word propitiation so many times and i have somewhat of a definition or christian understanding of it but i wanted to know the exact definition of this word propitiation definition of so if a young person tonight doesn't know here's the definition propitiation is the act of gaining or regaining the favor or good will of someone or something it is appeasement it's something that propitiates or appeases and the final definition for it ultimate definition the dictionary says it's an atoning sacrifice so when we read when we read the scripture that says and he is the propitiation for our sins for me i take it that is him regaining that favor with god for us it says that those that know him keep his commandments we have the old testament commandments and then we have the new testament where it's not that the law is erased and we can now be murderers and liars and thieves we were able to provide a sacrifice when we couldn't fulfill the law but now we have the perfect sacrifice that bloodshed on calvary where we can now through that grace through that new birth through that holy spirit and young people we know plain and simple that jesus christ is the way the truth and the life is because you cannot keep his commandments but then going into verse 5. the love of god is now perfected in him and we know then therefore we know that we are in him now the bible says that god is love and when we look at the stature of a perfect man so in us keeping his word young people nosotros but it's not something instant then now you're just giving that love but if that perfection of that love is taking place in you perfection then it's got to graduate from step to step to step it is going from faith graduating into virtue the one step at a time until you reach that seal of that perfect love of god one being perfected into the other one faith being perfected all the way into love and so i i went into that same scripture and i wanted to look up another definition and i looked up the word perfected and i know the definition in our modern dictionary yo definition but i got curious it went into the concordance and i pulled up the greek definition of that word perfected and it says to complete in a literal form to accomplish in a figurative form to consummate in a characteristical form to consecrate and to finish and to fulfill the consequ complete make perfect i said perfecto i i don't know for me i barely graduated high school honestly i cheated my way through 11th and 12th grade of high school so when i look at definitions and things like this they help me really understand what it is that i'm reading i i sometimes feel like my brother emmanuel manuel that can take things and understand them so easily las puede how they process in his brain so smoothly but i'm starting to learn to love this word more and more and more and i hope the young people you are starting to love this word more and more and more especially so then therefore then it is that you know him when the word has made an impact in your life young people and then your heart is opened up to him it's very simple you realize and something clicked that jesus christ is the savior and then once that love has now been perfected in you once time has taken its course you've now been now converted unto this gospel and you can truly say that now you know that you are in him like it says in the scriptures in john 14 20 the revelation day el dia that once again kind of repeating and nailing down the opening scriptures we took uh he that hath my commandments and that keepeth and i will manifest myself to him once again i had to jump into another definition and i took the word manifest and i went once again to that concordance and the greek definition of that word manifest it says to exhibit in person persona so to disclose by words to appear or declare plainly and informed so the lord here wanting to manifest himself to you young people so he wants to exhibit himself to you show himself to you in person he wants to disclose himself and everything about him to you and it says in the greek definition it is a different definition that plainly clara he just wants to appear declare and inform himself to you so let us keep those commandments you need love in your life just keep those commandments the lord will give you of that love he wants to give you of that love so now to enter into the message you know our duty is to immediately go and confess that wrong that we've done immediately if we sinned against god let him know what i did what happened and confess and get that off of our chest and then it's god's duty that by the blood of jesus he erases those sins but i know it's a little more difficult to actually follow through and do it now everyone here that has been called of god the moment that you were called of him he had that appointment in your life we had to you know what i don't want nothing to do with this but those of us that answered and said yes that's and that need that we needed in our lives is that we need a savior salvador because we are sinners liars we're worthy of hell somos dinos worthy of death that's why we needed a savior salvador but then you continue to walk in your walk and these things keep getting in your way yes you already answered to him you already accepted the lamb you applied the blood yeah but yet we stumble and we fall but god sees that effort that you're making is god sees you waking up each and every day young person he sees the motive and the objective in your heart and what your true desires are in your heart and through those tests and through that trine there he's going to find the place in the time where he's going to approve your faith and now we all seek approval today in some way shape or form we're looking for approval from somebody else whether it's from mama or papa papa the pastor the minister your boss at work or your husband or your wife we try to find that approval from somebody about the things we're doing the way we're living but now someone's got to be that great inspector is a grand inspector someone's got to give that final approval in your life the one that's applied and he he uses that type to talk about us how does it this boxcar it gets filled up with things and then it needs to be secured and tied down and then it needs to be sealed and then it's sent off to its final destination and when brother branham is explaining this he uses the scripture in ephesians 4 30. where the word says grieve not the holy spirit whereby ye are sealed until the day of your redemption so we have our ups and we have our downstream i don't know what state you're in no saying i don't know your personal life but if you identify and just apply the word to your life we and i don't know where you're standing and where you're personally standing at in your life and whether young or old if you're not sealed yet then it's time for you to get that ceiling think it's nice and secure and ready to go on his journey but the great inspector's coming yeah i'll get an inspector he's probably already came into your life and he sees that these things are just tossed everywhere put in its place and nice and neat and formal it's all loose it's shaking up today brother branham says that he makes you tear it all up and you've got to refill it back up brother branham says that we go from revival to revival this is and as i'm i'm reading this right here it just made me think he said brother you know what i got a revelation it's so funny i'm seeing how so many of my plants and my my vegetables have died on me but i noticed one thing i water my plants all the time but instead of providing just a small drip of water and keeping it constantly fed constantly constantly constantly rich with the nutrients that it needs constantly instead i just drown it with the revival of water and then i let it die out for a week and i drown it against again with the revival of water that's what brother branham's talking about here is we fix it up and we get ready and we're in that revival system but when you once you really got packed in peru and god's spirit has the right of way and you've become a child of god and the door cannot be opened up until its destination we are sealed by the holy ghost someone say hello without a honest sincerity where your heart is so i'm humbled you're so open where you yourself are being so sincere to him we're there then he can provide that seal in your life and you young people you can deceive anybody that you want to use you're the first person that knows you're a and and i was just a walking liar day-to-day vivi la vida but we need to be honest with ourselves and honest with god so that that way we can be filled with him and you know it's a funny thing that once we've had that experience we're so filled with him in our hearts is that rejoicing that first love that you're in is you know some of us maybe have a larger family you want to go convert somebody familiar want to go preach to some friends to family members some cousins but the same thing applies to them like it applied to you god can't do absolutely nothing until where that's that moment where there needs to be a total surrenderance to god you want me to have this job lord let thy will be done you want me to this this and this let thy will be done very simple young people holiness is muslim to you but you need to be honest with yourselves first so now going back you may deceive the pastor you may deceive the ministers your parents like we said uh when god plays back your thoughts and ever since the little kid i always had this image it is we we have a movie theater in san diego that's a dome in san diego and it almost seems every direction you turn you're watching the movie and it's a museum and that's how they have their theater set up and it looks like the heaven is the movie being i feel like there's going to be no escape wherever you turn yo no importa you won't be able to escape but see that evilness that was in your heart that lust for those sinful things that's going to show on that day brother emmanuel doesn't see what i lost after hey novello i don't see what brother emmanuel loves afternoon but there's a hard drive up there that's recording every single but to me that perfect example that if we so much as just look upon a woman and just lust after her and we've already in that manner committed adultery with her manera yeah so young people i don't know the things that you lust after you know but anything whatever it is whatever sinful thing that's tormenting you in your heart and the lord knows so it's better to get right here than to have to confront it up there embezzy you know it's amazing science nowadays you know science says we have over 6 000 thoughts in a day and the bible says that we are born in sin we speak lies we we're we're born in this hybrid nature we're evil natured so you young person knowing these things taking what science has said taking what the word of god has said and if we can put them together just think for yourself for you and your daily life out of those six thousand thoughts this you i think a lot more than half of those thoughts are evil then they are good because of the nature that were born in young people just think about it you go to sleep where you have no control over what you're going to dream about but yet i didn't make you dream that you know and sometimes there are these evil perverted dreams that you have those are your thoughts not my thoughts and without that change of nature without that holy spirit that can transform us the blood cannot be applied for not only our physical sins la sangre no solomente puedes replicato para nos respicados physics but it'll be applied for the thoughts of our mind and the thoughts of our heart i thank god for that and then god can look into you yeah god can check that box he can shake it up he can test it and then he'll approve that faith that you have and as you're crying and crying out to him asking him to give you that seal he can come down we mentioned about the steps of the new birth and we didn't get into it too deep [Music] he mentions the new birth mensiona and then the fourth illogo el cuarto he says sealed so let's jump to sanctification sanctification is and in the process you might go through many experiences beautiful supernatural experiences maybe in a service just like tonight you might find and we're not taking that from you i'm doubting that that's happening but you're still not born again you're the same person it is first the father needs to look inside of you he's got to test what's there what you've got so far probably that way once he's done so now they'll be able to so now you all are walking in that same line alright la vida and you're now a new creature in christ now everything that the father asks of you now you do it and you do it willingly because you love him because you're keeping his commandments he lives in you and you and him are not one now if we look at the life of samson i i really love samson as a child common men because the way hollywood paints samson hollywood he's always been this big strong man you know as i see my brother peter here come on peter i think of samson as his big guy like brother robert rodriguez samson come on brother branham tells us it wasn't like that this is it might have been on the contrary the short scrawny insignificant guy devi but now it makes sense for me insignificant that's the only way god could show his power in his mind if the man was seven foot tall and full of muscles but there's something different about this one so here we have samson who had experience after experience after experience experience and the bible says and i'm gonna i'm gonna say it like the bible says that the spirit of the lord came down mightily upon him can you think about that young people the spirit of the lord didn't just come down upon him it didn't just fill him but it came down mightily upon him all of the holy spirit came within him that that spirit of the lord has come down mightily in this same sanctuary after victory after victory victoria all those things meant absolutely nothing significant because he sold his birth right he sold out that strength bendios he sold his christian inheritance for some fleshly pleasure cristiano uh but we know the story that samson was restored and he did die to himself but he died at the end of the road where one last time he said just once more lord can you fill me mightily with your holy spirit the power of god came down upon him and he paid the redemption price but he paid it with his own life and blood is angry and we don't have to be like that we don't need to wait till the end of the road row del camino you heard the testimony of our brother gomez you've heard plenty of testimonies of people here in church of the hard things that they had to go through you don't need to be redeemed back like that you can be redeemed tonight as good now if we jump over to the fourth step i want and we're going to start closing in a little bit brother bernie calls it sealed he also has the word tested and if we take the example of abraham that right before god could seal him he needed to be tested that's why he was told he was given that order go and sacrifice your son uh i don't know if that would fly with any one of us but god knew what he had in abraham produced i thank god that's not the test he's going to put upon me but at least i can see in the scriptures that if he were to jose i have one that's done it already and i want to be like my brother abraham and there he was he passed that test he took the knife he took his son he laid the sacrifice and he passed that test he got that seal that seal that cannot be broken that sealed it all the way into your destination and now i'm going to be uh if you all please stand we're going to be closing sometimes uh these things can be so simple you've been sanctified sanctification that's good kbn but the question i would ask is have you been tested and if the answer is yes well then have you passed the test and if the answer is no if no then you need to be tested again and test it again until you the question will be have you been sealed and if the answer is no then what is it that you're waiting for this evening if you know that god is here this evening and the holy spirit wants to come upon you mightily then he had to pay with his own life [Music] if you've been living your life up to now and you haven't used that altar in the privacy of your home well we have an altar here for you tonight i'm not the one that didn't make you use that private altar but i have one here that you can use today where no one else has to see you and the perseverance that you've had and he can give you that seal no i could tell you about the kingdom i can testify about the kingdom i can point you to the kingdom and the pastor he guides the flock to the feet of jesus jesus he's the one that tries to point us to christ these youth services is where you'll never thirst again you might be thinking why do i keep doing these desires of the flesh why do i keep having these evil thoughts well you've only reached the border line from teresa you haven't crossed into the land and that's the worst place that you can be in yes the bible says that i'd rather you be a total sinner or a total saint santo complete instead of being half stepping in business having one foot in and one foot out being that make-believer manufacturer playing church pleasing mama or papa you know if we can only take the example of the israelites and do what they did right and not what they did wrong take that lamb apply that and they were dancing and rejoicing they were praising and they were singing and all of that for nothing because they weren't there yet they still had three more days to go but instead they followed their hearts they followed their thoughts they fell into unbelief they fell into their own doctrines it's god's obligation to give you the new birth obligation but it's your obligation to be honest and open your heart to him brother branham was asked brother branham and mano branham how long does it take to be born again what a question and what an answer is and father with all these youth present and those on line every single one of them in different stages of their life some in justification summon sanctification justification some have received their new birth and some are about to receive their new birth lord father i ask that you would look into them lord father and if you see a sincere heart father whether at this altar tonight or whether in the privacy of their altar at home in their bedroom father that your holy spirit would come down mightily upon them and that you can approve their faith lord that you can give them that seal and that they'll be really ready to make it to that final destination father i thank you for everything lord patriot we give you all the honor and glory in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen [Music] here we are [Music] here we are [Music] here we are in your presence hallelujah praise your holy name father [Music] he's brought us through here we are he's here this evening we are in your presence lord hallelujah we are lifting our holy hands to you father [Music] here we are [Music] please let's sing one more time here we [Music] your are [Music] here we are [Music] glory hallelujah amen
