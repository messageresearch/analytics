things that we need to to be ready for you help us in this evening we surrender ourselves unto you for we ask this part of the service and likewise the remaining of the service we ask it in the Blessed name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen just as you're standing I'm going to be reading two different parts of the scriptures the first one will be in Luke 23 um and we'll start on verse 33. and in this part it speaks about the crucifixion of our Lord Jesus Christ and it says on verse 33 is and when they were come to the place which is called Calvary There They Crucified him and the male factors one on the right hand and on the other left is then said Jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his Remnant and cast slots and the people stood beholding and the rulers also with them divided him saying he saved others let him save himself if he be Christ The Chosen of God and the soldiers also mocked him coming to him and offering him vinegar and saying if thou be the king of the Jews save thyself in a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek in Latin and Hebrew this is the king of the Jews and one of the male factors which were hanged railed on him saying if thou be Christ save thyself in US but the other answering rebuked him saying does not thou fear God see in Thou Art in the same condemnation and we indeed just leave for we receive the due reward of our Deeds but this man had done nothing amiss Jesus Lord remember me when thou cometh into thy kingdom Jesus and Jesus said unto him verily I say unto thee today shall thou be with me in paradise and it was about the sixth hour and there was a Darkness all over all the Earth until the ninth hour yes and the sun was darkened and the veil of the temple was ran in the myths in another scripture in the book of Hebrews from verse 19 to 22. this is Christo having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest of the blood of Jesus and Living Way which he has consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh is and having a high priest over the house of God I said let us run here with the true heart and full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated before we get started I wanted to give a missionary report in regards to the missionary trip that I had with our pastor brother ordonius and this past weekend me and him we went to the Mexico City and it was By Invitation of our brother Francisco olgin as soon as a couple of months ago he gave me a call and he asked me if I could go and speak to his youth or and the meetings and so then our brother ordonius and I made plans to go down there and once we arrived Hermanos all of the it was very good that we arrived in the Mexico City and we arrived with Christians because the city of Mexico is well known for something else but when we arrived there we arrived with the Christians everybody treated us very well this is from our brother olgin and from the people from the church I wanted to give a special thanks to our brother Eric Cruz he was the brother that received Us in his home and in the same way it was the same brother that received brother Johnny back on in 2015. brother Johnny also visited Mexico City and from what he told me he helped brother Johnny to go by that cross that we have here in front of the Pope he is and I was also mentioning to him about this how it is and it turns out that the first day that we used it was for his funeral the Lord knows all things when we were over there in the meetings [Music] and then from the airport I believe he drove about an hour all the way to his house [Music] and when we arrived to this house his wife gave us me and brother something is and as soon as we finished eating we quickly changed because the service was going to start at five now what I want to speak about this evening is I have entitled it the the veil of our own will uh for those that know me interpreter not only do I preach but I also interpret hey yes and that was something that I had struggled for men for some time because I personally don't like to be in front of everybody but it wasn't my will it was the will of God so when somebody serves God you yourself have to surrender your own will unto him and if you surrendered you also Surrender Your Body along with it so since the first day that we arrived over there I had to surrender my own will and surrender my body and interpret and another one from Ghana and they didn't really know any Spanish so I had to sit behind them and interpret to them uh during the service and just as our brother Juanito tells us when you go to the missionary field you go to work and you rest very scarcely immediately so as soon as I got there that's how quickly I started working but both of those Brothers before they were able to understand what that brother was preaching about that Thursday night and if you remember that Thursday was the 6th of aprila is random and it's brother branham's birthday and that brother had touched on certain points of the birthday of brother Branham and one of those things was Julius celebration that the Jews have a celebration I forget the name is but in that celebration they're all gathered on in in a table and when they're gathered around a table you're obviously sitting down on a chair celebration but in that celebration centados everybody seated down but there is an empty chair and this is the Jews as the reason why they would do that because the Jews are waiting for the promise for the Elysian that was promised to come on Earth and they would do that on the 6th of April well it turns out that the 6th of April is the Lord said Elijah but not to the Jews to us the Gentiles and another part that I really enjoyed about what the brother preached um for those that for those of you that know that brother Branham passed away on the 24th of December Hanukkah and there is another Feast that's called the Hanukkah Fiesta Los Padres and in that Feast the parents would make a couple of games with the kids the Jews would tell their kids all right children go find Elijah he want to go hide yes and that is done on the 24th of December and then on the 24th of December foreign so the Lord has a Time designated for everything so we really rejoiced ourselves over there in the services we were able to meet many new brothers uh Hermanos de Mexico brothers from different parts of Mexico and likewise from uh Peru the Espana from Spain the Puerto Rico from Puerto Rico De Colombia from Colombia is and every single one of them were very kind under us [Music] and it turns out that the majority of the people that I talked to Medicine oh yeah I already know you're the that interpreter I see you in the videos we've been following you for many years so they really they really see us so if you're asleep I think it'd be better if you woke up but everybody was very kind he is and then it fell on my lot on Saturday morning to speak unto the young people a couple of days before yolk every time I would change my topic I had a certain subject that I wanted to talk about but I had no idea or a way to get to that point so it was finally at that morning that the Lord helped me and I spoke about what we're about to speak on tonight so it turned out that being that it was Easter weekend Jesus that when Jesus was on the cross the scripture says that he cried out on a great voice and it said that the veil was written Twain in the middle and he says in the message Revelation chapter four number two this is then how do how do we get into this now remember there was a veil um a veil that hangs between the holy and the holiest of holy Christ and the holiest of all these is where Christ comes to sit down on your heart's Throne Cristo Centron Christ is enthroned he who comes through costales Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostals whosoever you know what that Veil is that veils your heart from it are you ready the veil is called self-will captain do you get the picture now you said the census out there Los Angeles the senses on the body and the senses of the Soul and the veil between that and the holy place the holiest of Holy Spirit and the only way that you can get in there is to have self-will is now when I heard brother Adams say this obviously one would automatically believe them [Music] but there's certain occasions where you don't really fully understand the reason as to why brother Branham says the way that he does now in the Tabernacle uh there were veils that separated different sections of of the Tabernacle okay so there was a veil that would divide the outer courts and the holy place and then there was another Veil between the holy place and the holiest of holy I realized that these two veilsidos they are very similar the veil that's out there is very similar to The Veil that's over here and then we'll attempt to try to show you this is between the holy place and the holiest of holy is the veil of self-will so then you can notice how the Lord Jesus Christ surrendered his will do you remember when he was out and uh Gethsemane yeah and he was having a great battle in within himself he didn't have it with anybody else he was have he was dealing with his own self he did not want to die Jesus Jesus was not at fault he never he also surrendered his body there's two veils as we read in Hebrews and where it says that we now have access onto the holiest place Jesus it was because for because of Jesus surrendering his own will he surrendered his body Jesus and if you remember Jesus himself said when he was face to face with a pilot is he said my kingdom is not of this Earth for if it was I would call in Legions of angels to come forth but Jesus never did that because he's when he surrendered his own will he also surrendered his body with it there's two very and the other one is of the body but both of them are very similar is because we know that this flesh has its own desires but also the heart has its own desires there's two veils but they're very similar Jesus so in Jesus when he ripped his own uh Veil he surrendered himself surrendered his own human will God's Will and God will is for him to surrender his body as a sacrifice opening the veil of his body is taking out all of his own attributes that were with them but he first he surrendered his own human will and then he surrendered his human body that's why there's two veils and both of them are very similar no I'm gonna bypass a lot of scriptures we're going to go to Exodus 26. we're going to show you that these two veilsidas are very similar are you understanding up to this point are those velos there's two veils the interior Veil exterior and the exterior if you surrender yourself within if you surrender your own heart you will surrender your body to God like myself I Surrender my own will okay I did not want to be an entrepreneur I did not want to be a preacheria but that's not what God wanted God wanted me to be a preacher and an interpreter and as I kept surrendering myself unto him I Surrender my body as well I'm surrendering my voice I'm surrendering my hearing under him that is just the same as when I have to interpret I have to hear the minister as I Surrender myself within history I'm also surrendering my body to be able to put forth the work that's why the two veils they're very similar but one of them is the intervales and the other one is the outer Veil persisted but if you surrender your inner Veil your own self human will then you will also Surrender Your Own carnal desires of your body so on those velos there's two veils and they're very similar and we're going to show you that says Uno and going into Exodus 26 1. moreover thou shall make the Tabernacle with 10 curtains of fine-twined linen and blue and purple and Scarlet with turbines of cunning work shall thou make them so as you can notice all the materials that go within the veils now the Tabernacle foreign [Music] so it went this way and when it got to the entrance it would fall down this way this is so it was 10 in total Traverse now we're going to read it again Tabernacle with 10 curtains a fine-twined linen and blue and purple and Scarlet with turbines of cunning work shall thou make them and also the veil that it will allow you to come from the outer courts into the holy Place between the holy and the holiest place material is also made of the same materials now if you go to Exodus 26 31 Venus and thou shall make a veil of blue and purple and Scarlet and fine twine linen of cunning work with cherubins shall it be made so as you can see that the Tabernacle primer Velo with the first Veil e El Segundo Velo and the second Veil foreign were made out of the same material can you see that because you as well have two veils because you also are a Tabernacles you have your outer courts you have your holy place and that's the reason why you have your two veils and if both of those veils of the Tabernacles were very similar and then likewise the veils that you have are very similar you have the veil of the flesh then you have the veil of your own self-will because when we are born we are born with sin in the body and also with within the heart so when Jesus saves us and he gives us of his holy spirit he takes away the sin of the heart but he does not take away the sin of this flesh this uh body is is death so The Marvelous thing about all this is that in verse 32 this is this and thou shall hang it upon four pillars would overlaid with gold their hooks shall be of gold upon the four sockets of silver what movie and cuando El Velo de foreign notice the natural man even counts backwards this is I said he did things backwards he counts backwards watch his count dies unocero ten nine eight seven six five four three two one zero see he goes back and starts counting he's all 10 is a bad number that's right to start with 10 is a bad number they had 10 tribes of Israel and then was just all carnals there was 12 tribes but only ten of them were very Carnales so ten speaks about the carnal nature is this party is is flesh is so that so then the other way foreign and they're very similar for the mistake that you did uh through your outer Veil I dos velos there's two veils is your own self-will what you decide to do and sometimes you do things for that carnal push but then there's also times that you do things for your uh heart's desire yeah and then there's times in that it's going to be difficult to be able to distinguish one from the other natural because within the naturals that both of those veils foreign they appear to be very similar is going to get upset good thing that they're recording this is so then you can see that the outer Veil eradvies was 10. when it was closed usted you when you were closed off from God you are very carnal minded you are 10. but if you surrender your body you first Surrender Your Own inner Veil and then you surrender your outer Veil that number 10 is the carnal mindedness becomes two number fives what's number five it's Grace ay dos gracias there's two Grace La primer Gracia the first Grace is the grace of Salvation then the second grace is the rapturing grace and in First Peter 1 10 watch how Peter begins to talk about two different Graces the first one is talks about uh which is salvation and then he talks about a future Grace and then in verse 10 this is of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you gracias La salvation so now we can notice that the first Grace is salvation Jesus so when Jesus arrives for the first time he comes with an initial Grace that he wishes to give you every Christian that's here has received the first grace of God you were saved by grace and then when Jesus comes for the second time La Segunda Gracia the second grace will activate within you Jesus because when Jesus comes he won't physically come on the earth brother so he doesn't come down completely the Bible says that we will meet up with him with in the in the near Commerce how is it that you're going to meet the Lord Jesus Christ in the air is this party is subject to the gravity so then you now you find yourself that you need a second grace when you are born again when you have accepted the salvation of the Lord Jesus Christ you receive eternal life and Su Alma Within but not within your flesh that's why we still keep getting sickness that's why we continue to suffer within this body we already have eternal life but only within the soul but when Jesus comes for the second time he will come to give us eternal life not within our soul but now in our flesh will give you a new Young body that's eternal so he comes to give you life but you only have eternal life within your soul but then when he arrives will give you a body that will have the capacity to be able to defy gravity and to be able to go up into the air only that Eternal Body will be able to do that Jesus because right after when Jesus had died and resurrected he was in an eternal body that he was able to travel so fast and then after being with the disciples and on Earth for about 40 days he had the ability to be able to rise up into the the the air into the La Primera Gracia so the first Grace gives you eternal life and to Alma within your soul the second grace will give you eternal life in a body Pedro we're going to continue reading in First Peter 1 11. this is searching what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow is Los Angeles unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they that they did Minister the things which are now reported Under You by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the Angels desired to look into now and then in verse 13 minutes notice how Peter begins to talk about a future Grace this is wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope till the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ so then in the first coming of Christ he came to give the first Grace and then in the second coming he comes to give us the second grace so the first Grace that he comes when he arrives he gives us the grace of his salvation to be able to inherit eternal life and Jesus said in the scriptures he said that he looked upon him and he loved them poor and then if you remember it said that he did not acceptable because he revealed what his own self will was what was the what kind of veil was it that he had okay what kind of carnal desires did he have within him he did not want to surrender his Willow he did not want to rip his veil of his riches he told them sell sell all of your riches and give unto the poor I think there's many people that misunderstand that scripture Jesus Jesus told that to him because he knows that if he was genuinely going to be able to surrender to allow the Lord Jesus Christ in the Holy Spirit form in enter into his heart and because of the light of the Holy Spirit would be able to come down and give him eternal life but because he did not do that and his body was in torture so if you surrender your intervales you will also surrender your outer veils so if you surrender your inner Veil that you have within you usted you will then surrender your outer Veil that you have within outside of you but since he did not surrender his inner will that means his outer will suffered along with it but if you surrender your Veil that's within you El Senor you will rejoice yourself with the Lord with the brand new Veil a brand new body there's two veils they're very similar then you surrender the next fail you surrender your own self human will then you surrender your body it's just like when that person that's just been saved they surrendered their heart unto the Lord Jesus Christ and then they surrender their bodies to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because there's two veils and just as our brother Marco Santana uh spoken to us he spoke about the process of the new birth he said how someone should repent and baptized but there's people that only get baptized and never got repented they surrendered but they never surrender their inner Veil let thy will be done which was different from the will of God because Jesus was innocent he never did anything wrong pero but he died as if he was a sinner was for him to die for the sins of everybody else so then there's two veils and Jesus Christ also had them because Jesus surrendered his inner veil of he also surrendered his outer veilpo he surrendered his bodies you as well have the two veils you first of all in your heart surrender is likewise surrender unto God and then if you remember that the veil within the holy and the holiest holiest is between the outer courts and the holy Place says that it was open because you surrender your inner uh well that will automatically cause that you open up the outer Veil that Jesus Christ himself did surrendering his own human will and because you surrender your own human will you surrender your human body so then there's two Grace the inner Grace and the outer Grace the grace of Salvation giving you eternal life within your heart or your soul and the other Grace is the rapture in Grace when he comes he will give you eternal life into cuerpo within your body yes and in that body has the capacity to be able to rise in the air the literally to literally go into the presence of the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ and if I had more time I would be able to explain it more foreign linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints now it's fine linen and it's white do you remember when brother Brandon passed over uh beyond the the current time he passed that veilos because are within the dimensions do you remember when he said that he can see his body he was so close that he can still see his body but it's a veil of Dimensions that permits you to open the veil and that you can see was made of fine linen is that was the garments in which they were dressed and then when brother Brandon went beyond the curtain of time when he saw all the saints that were over there they were all dressed in white that is the fine linen you go outside of that once you pass that Veil below the Avail of that body you enter into a brand new body with a brand new garment elino Fino the fine linen El Blanco why and then they also had the color of blue this is and brother Brandon says that in Hebrews chapter 6 part 3 this is great Forerunner has gone before us making a way to he become from a spirit Las Grandes Fuentes the great Fountains of the rainbow of God who had no beginning nor endos he was forever God is this ray of light went forth it was Ray of love that's the main one red the next color follows which was blue El color the next color follows which was blue blue the truth the trueness so then true or Bloom represents the trueness and then in another uh quote uh in the message the baptism of the holy spirit this is amor and then the first great spirit of God which is love God like the great rainbow nope we couldn't imagine what he looks like but just say he looks like the rainbow them Spirits the perfect Spirit of Love is Blue the perfect Spirit of Fellowship he saw that the people were dressed and finally and everybody came to have fellowship with him that's what blue represents and the perfect Fellowship all the people that he saw were the people that accepted his message and we know that this message is the truth to be able to have fellowship with the rest of the brothers that had already passed on that's why that Veil and had the color blue is represented in the color of white so each one of these colors has its own significant meaning and this is [Music] you will also surrender or open the outer Veil okay which becomes then the two races and the first Grace foreign was placed within the dimensions but then also within you but everything begins that you surrender your own will if you're able to surrender your own self-will that you have within you then the Lord will come and help you with this outer Veil don't surrender your body first Surrender Your Heart and then that's what's going to cause that you naturally surrender your body to God foreign it's kind of hard to be able to distinguish between one and the other he wants you from your own will Tomaso decision take your decision if you wish to rip it or not or if you wish to keep it close this is now remember that in the Bible says in John 3 16. for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son any one that believes in them but have eternal life everything is based off of your own decision Jesus said that he loved or the Bible says that Jesus loved Enrico the Rich Young Ruler Jesus but just because Jesus loved them they didn't mean that he received eternal life the Bible says that Jesus loves the world but not because Jesus loves the world but everything is based off of if you love him if you love him you surrender your will is you you surrender that inner Veil you are of your own self will rip it in half yes and then he is going to help you with your outer veils sometimes gets sick [Music] if you're out of vale it doesn't want to come to church sometimes commits incorrect things being that the holy spirit is already within you decision and you already made your decision to surrender your own will so then within yourself will cause that you're out reveal surrender once again to God that's a very important key is that you surrender the inner Veil first and then the outer Veil will open up that's why when some when some of the people that get baptized or those that accept the Lord Jesus Christ as their savior they don't do it correctly because they first surrender the outer Veil the first one that must be surrendered is the interior if you sincerely surrender that inner Veil this is naturally the outer Veil is going to open up that's the key everything is based off of free moral agency what is your decision do you want to surrender under God and convert that number 10 which is that carnal mindedness in those gracias into two Graces but everything is based off of you you have to make your own decisions because the Lord is a gentleman he's not going to rip the Veil Just because he feels like he's not going to force the entry it all comes down to you if you could please stand if you sometimes with the outer Veil that happens to everybody just make sure that the interview is the one that's surrendered unto God so if you if you struggling with the outer Veil the interval is going to help you to open up the outer veils if you within yourself have the Holy Spirit you already have a surrendered heart and if there's something that you're struggling with this evening remember what the Bible says about David okay that he was a man after God's Own Heart so that Veil is within that heart so even though he committed many great mistakes that interior veil of David yeah was already written two important so it didn't matter what kind of mistakes David did what God really cared about is that that inner Veil within David was already ripped every single one of us makes mistakes so if we commit a mistake in the outer Veil osiacas or maybe you still have sin within your heart La clave is the very key is confess your sins and surrender unto God and then the Lord will help you with the rest let us pray Lord help us to be able to follow that example that the Lord Jesus Christ gave us he surrendered and when he was up at Calvary he surrendered his body help us Lord be able to do the same to be able to surrender our own human will and also likewise surrender our flesh help us this evening and forgive us of our sins there's times where that outer Veil wants to maintain itself close but are you are you the nursing Lord help us to be able to surrender within ourselves and then the outer Veil will open up to the rest so that the rest of the world can see the light that's already within us help us in this evening Lord my name is Christopher we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen may
