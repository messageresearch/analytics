brothers of how important our faith is um brother Bram said that the faith is six sense faith is [Music] revelation and if there is something that everyone needs is that is faith if you empowered by that [Music] faith I remember that one of the youth here preached about [Music] that where Faith um comes in contact with the all Mighty and there is nothing impossible everything is possible I preach pres when I returned home that Monday when I went to work at um 1 a 1 a.m. it was a bit cold I went to my car and then I turned it on it turned on but the lights didn't it turned on but the lights did not turn on and I tried um turning him on I turned the car off and then I turned on again and the lights were not turning on I went to another car and then I went to [Music] work and I went to there was smiling I wasn't worried or angry but I was [Music] smiling because he went there and we help [Music] Brothers Satan also has the right to put us in trials and he did it with my car and that was um but he didn't know that I went there and I went to work all morning and during my shift um it says a word and I believe in that and brother T always says it time to to see say that word in this [Music] morning all of you have the right to say the word I said the word I said that when I return um from work that the lights will turn on and it was getting late before I went to home and I returned I didn't take anything from the car and I turned it on once more and the lights turned on automatically Brethren who did it um God does the work and if you have to whatever you need just say it say unto the Lord and believe it Lord Heavenly [Music] Father you have done many things among every one of us but you do certain things that just gave us in shock because we know that we serve a living God and this morning we're honoring your Resurrection we're we're um approaching your throne of Mercy I'm confessing all our fults confessing [Music] everything when we are placing everything onto the prary and that's under your blood we pray this morning that you may help us that you may increase our faith that we may be able to believe you and in your promises if it will [Music] happen if someone said anything they will it happen and Lord I give thanks for everything you've done in my life I am very astonished with you cuz you are a real [Music] God it's a God that honors and answers his word and if you ask you will [Music] receive then we ask with all our hearts this morning for all these needs that have been asked for and those who are in the hospitals to those who have appointments to those have given thanksgivings for the life and half that you have granted them until this until May please embrace them all those thanksgivings place them into your glorious hands this morning and once more I ask that you may increase our [Music] faith that when that when we we can just ask for everything that we may need for and that we will believe that it will happen maybe it will not happen at that moment maybe we just have to [Music] wait but that waiting time during that waiting time you're working because you know all things and you're just um testing us and we

I I just don't want an anointing today I I I just don't want God just to come through and go by but I want him to dwell in me Lord dwell in me Lord I I want him to dwell in me so that I I can leave here I can leave here a different person I can leave here better than I did coming in that's what that's my prayer this morning but but the first step is here already he's here this morning he's already moving he's moving in the songs he's moving in the specials he's moving throughout every Pew this morning my prayer this morning Lord dwell in me I want to go straight to the scriptures if you would like to turn with me to Colossians [Music] Colossians 1 verse4 I just want to greet you all in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ it's such an honor to spend Christmas Eve with each and every one of you that we can be here in the presence of the Lord together Colossians 1 14 and 15 and it says in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of [Music] sins who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature let us bow our heads oh Heavenly [Music] Father Lord we come here this morning W with great expectation Lord not just because it's a Christmas Eve Lord but Lord because you promise that every time we assemble together we assem in your name you promise that you'll be in our midst father whether it's a Christmas Eve or any other day Lord father our hearts stand in expectation for your Holy Spirit for your word father Lord so that you may change the situation in our lives father I ask with all of my heart father Lord that your Holy Spirit take control father that every heart that is here this morning may receive of your unadulterated word Lord father and we can leave here strengthened father that you may speak to us Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask all these things amen and amen amen amen you may be seated this my title this morning it's um I'm continuing with a the title a body thou Hast prepared me and and my subtitle this morning just because it's Christmas Eve it's God wrapped gift here in um the verse 14 and verse 15 it's showing something that we already know that through his blood that we have received the Forgiveness of our sins through his blood but but Paul he says that this man that shed his blood he was the very image of the invisible God everything that God created everything that God is from eternity all the way to Eternity it was hidden within this man Jesus Christ he was the in the image of that invisible God and if we go go down to verse 21 it shows what our situation and our and our condition was he says and you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet hath he now yet hath he reconciled amen Brothers we were all we're all enemies of God right out of the womb we become enemies we become alienated from the Lord and and and Paul says by our [Applause] mind by our Wicked works now now brother bam says that we're a Triune being that that we have a a body a spirit and a soul and and here Paul is saying that our mind and our works which is our body are alienated from the Lord so this body this body is meant to be a temple of the Lord this body is meant to be dwelt in but because of our condition because of our mind and our Wicked works we become alienated but in 22 this is what he says but in this body or in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight SES this body was alienated from God so then it took the image of God to come into a body he said through this body of Flesh through death he would reconcile us again and in verse 26 he says he says even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifested manifest to his Saints what was the mystery Brothers there was a mystery that was made manifested today this mystery was hidden throughout all the ages this mystery people try to find this mystery verse 27 it says to who God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory that's the mystery see we were alienated from God we don't deserve for the spirit to dwell in US sin has separated us sin took us away from his Spirit but then God came in a body and he allowed that body to die on the cross for us he allowed that body to suffer and when that body suffered he opened up a way where that mystery could be revealed and that mystery isn't way over there that mystery wasn't in some other place it's Christ in you that's the mystery that Christ dwells in his bride what a beautiful scripture amen now brother Bram he he uh read the scripture in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed and that message is so profound for for the message believer bride because it shows where Christ is Brothers we can know that what what Christ did 2,000 years ago we can know what he did um even a 100 years ago but where is he today and in that message it showed what the mystery was now now just to give a little recap of of what I spoke last time just so we can pick it up where we start where we finished off um we spoke on how our bodies are designed to be temples of God to be the housing of the spirit and the temples of the Jews they were built just to be shadows and types so that they can show what God Was preparing to do and and and um stepen he gave the Pharisees a question he said how be it that the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands he says for Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stool and he says where is my place of my rest and brother Bram says a body thou Hast prepared me that's what our bodies are meant to be God created each and every person here he created a spirit first the Bible says when he created man and woman he created the spirit and that Spirit was in the image of God and then he formed the body and and and then brother Bram says that God poured or blew the spirit of life into Adam and he became a living Soul so so we are beings not only to be tied to this Earth but but we are tied to Eternity to another dimension and and I begin to think about this world that we see and I I see that the problem is that be people begin to be more focused on this flesh how how is this flesh doing H H how does it feel how are my feelings and we begin to live in the flesh now we see that in the whole world that we fulfill the desires of the flesh whe whether whether it's its um immoral desires if it's desires to become a great rich person to be popular fill uh desires of Anger of different emotions people begin to live off of their emotions live off of the flesh when when a man is is tied to the Earth and to Heaven also brother brandom I I once heard him say how people would throw $50 $100 meat cones on them and they would raise up their nose thinking they were better than somebody and he said if you raise he would raise their nose so high that if it rained it would drown them because because they were putting a meat coat pile of potash where brother bam says only cost 84 cents brother brandham he he begin to devalue the body showing that the body is is no good and it's not that it's no good but but it becomes no good it becomes void it becomes animalistic without the Holy Spirit and we we begin to value that now now I'm not talking about you precious Brothers unless you want to receive it but the whole world everybody we are are so focused on her outer appearance on these brother bam says these 16 elements we we care about what the world see how the world perceives this outer flesh when there's a soul inside there crying out for life that is worth more than 10,000 worlds but but we we value these things brother brandham says in the greatest battle ever fought see he says see it's your mind that opens up the door now I I just want to see how our body works brother brandom explained the whole thing that we are a Triune being and and and we are temples meant to be dwelt in so so then he's saying it's your mind that opens up the door and closes the door and listens to your conscience listens to your memory and listens to your affections so so we we have seed taste feel smell and hear that's that's this body right here then there's another realm in that man where it it's conscious affection it's memory and all of those things within that man and he says that your mind begins to open up to these things and and and most of the world they'll only know those two Realms of themselves then they begin to separate themselves from the spirit which is in the Inner Man in in the the inner the holy of holies but people that they'll separate themselves from and they open up the door they open up their mind to to affections and and emotions or or the things that they see the things that they taste man you you know what's amazing about this time of year the tamales the the the all of the food oh brother we'll govern ourselves with that taste oh what else do we govern ourselves in this time with our sight what am I going to get for Christmas today we're we're so we're governed by these things but rightly so that we're connected to this world we can't help but to have a connection to this world I I can't help but to love the food that I love and love the things that I love but whenever we begin to be governed by it we began to cater or when we begin to cater to the flesh these five senses or even the the inner five senses we we actually begin to cater to the devil brother brandham says in the Oneness of unity he said God made you so you could be empty so so he made the human being to be empty for when you was born you was made with a place to be filled and then he says this by Nature you're a child of the devil that's pretty harsh but that's what the prophet said by Nature we're all Little Devils we come to this world speaking lies we come to this world stealing and lying and hating because of what happened in the Garden of Eden he says and then an an evangelist will come along and and you repent and get all cleaned up then and he continues on in the um the unity of one God in the one church you can be of the um you can be full of foolishness you can be full of nonsense you can be full of anything but you can't stay empty the Bible says you can't so so Why Can't We Trust our five senses then why can't we trust the inner five senses because no matter what if we're not serving God we think we're just serving the flesh but we can't stay empty there's something manipulating those five senses there's something manipulating those emotions your decisions he continues on in the greatest battle ever fought there it is right there those channels you just get them and open up don't you just bypass them then if Satan can get through there see Satan's always going to try to get through there get by the conscience and all these other things and then get right down here to the end of the soul in the mind now if if he can just get you you'll never you'll never look at one of them until you first let him here in here but when you have to let him then when he gets in he's got control then what does he do he begins to use the conscience he begins to use this begins to use this Outlet what is it see see taste uh feel smell and hear imaginations conscience memories reasonings affections he begins to use all of those different little channels as long as he could get in above this one here why can't we live in the flesh because we've got an enemy today brother Brenham says it's the greatest battle ever fought and you have an enemy that is going to attack your conscience that's going to attack your memory your affections he's going to attack your body he's going to attack you with sickness he's going to attack you w with certain things that are going on in your body you we wonder why why am I so anxious all the time why can't I just have a good night's rest why is bad thoughts always coming to my mind because there's an enemy there in the beginning Satan picked and chose the part of a man he chose the intellectuals he chose the the head and God took the heart God took where it was important he took that part where the Holy Spirit can dwell but the devil will take your mind and he'll attack it and attack it and attack until because this is the beauty of all of it he cannot affect you he he's a big Bluff he he's he's a liar he cannot enter into your body until you let him and then when you allow him then you begin to fulfill the lusts of the flesh you think you're just thinking with your own thoughts but you have somebody in the control tower that is trying to take over now we know that the first battle was in heaven and brother brandham says that it was Ang Battle of angels and then it was cast out onto human beings it wasn't cast just to the Earth it was cast onto you and I there's a great battle going on even as you sit tonight this morning am I going to accept certain things am I going to reject reject this what am I going to do after this what are my desires how do I feel all those are running through our mind now now my question is why is the devil so eager to attack the children of God to take control over our lives and possess the children of God let us turn to um jude6 un the Bible says he says and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he ha reserved an everlasting chains under Darkness unto Judgment of the great day now that that word estate they left their first estate they left their original condition but left or or but left their own habitation now I've said this before right before I ended on the last message but that word habitation is the word okarian which means a Dwelling Place a habitation of the body as a dwelling place for the spirit now now this word this Greek word was only in the Bible two times and this is this is the second time it's it's mentioned that they left their habitation now people say oh they left heaven but that that Greek word means a body that it was a body that they left that they were cast out because he was the lightbearer he he had a body and the Bible says that body was the most beautiful that body he was the most beautiful angel he was the brightest angel Lucifer means a lightbearer and God took his light from that angel and and Jesus once saw as they cast out Devils he saw Satan Fall Out of Heaven like lightning brother Bram says in the message question and answers question and answers on Genesis he says 2/3 of of the earth is in sin and more than that which two-thirds of Angels were kicked out see how how he switches here he says twoth thirds of angels was kicked out and those demon spirits come into people and habitate their body they were Angels they were kicked out and were demons spirits and what did the Bible say they left their habitation and brother Bram here says now they come into people and habitate their body see what I mean they're demons that once they once existed listen to what he says they once existed and they come into the people and give them a nature amen amen now now he now brother brandham says this or you know what let us um the Lord let us go to 2 Corinthians 5 1 and 4 and we're going to show where where's the next word of okarian okarian now now the reason why I I I've been pressed to speak this so we can understand why we are here in this earth why did we have to come here to be tempted why do I have to be in this body of death this is the greatest opportunity that we have here amen amen so 1 Corinthians 51 now let's see how how Paul he explains our bodies he says for we know that our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens look how he he's explaining the body Earthly house Tabernacle building house and he's talking about these two houses he says when this Earthly Tabernacle when it's dissolved we already have one waiting in heaven we already have a body so in verse two he says for in this We Grown earnestly to be clothed with our house which is from heaven so to be clothed and this word with our house is the next word okarian he's not talking about heaven he's not talking about a great big mansion or a house Paul is talking about a body he says whenever we're clothed with this Oker in this house we where we're groaning to be clothed with this Heavenly Body and whatever those angels were clothed with the Bible says they were cast out from they left that okar in that house now they're what are they there are spirits roaming around that's illegal he says this if so that that being clothed we shall not be found naked man Paul he just knows how to talk he's talking about a house now he's talking about a clothing but he's saying we're clothed we're we're groaning to be clothed with this house he he he says he says if that be so we will not be found what naked naked a spirit we won't be just a floating Spirit somewhere but but when we leave this house we're going to step into another house we're not going to be a floating spirit and and and we know that when I'm I'm sorry for using these phrases but we know when somebody's Naked Brother that's illegal put some clothes we will not be found without a body a roaming Spirit which is illegal in this world because when God he he created man he created the spirit but then he says I want you to have contact with this world I want you to walk around I want you to have Dominion so I'm going to put this Spirit into this body so that you can have dominion and whenever your Dominion is over I'll have another body so that you can go into another dimension and and Paul says he says you will not be found illegally wandering [Applause] around verse four he says for that that are in this Tabernacle do grow being burdened not that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up in life so that word clothe clothed it means a spiritual and ET Eternal habitation that we should dwell in now you you cannot dwell in these natural Dimensions as a spirit God made a body for you so that the spirit can operate in this earth and when the body dies the spirit will go to a certain Dimension depending on how they used this body how did you use this Tabernacle what did you do with it and depending on what you did with this body if we fulfilled the lust of the flesh we're going to be going to an a habitation according to what we did with this and and I realized that this is this spot where where Paul says we grown we grown to be changed We Grown to go to heaven but even though we grown yet in this body this is where it matters brothers and sisters this is where Grace is once you leave this body your fate is sealed once you leave this body there is no more grace once you leave this body your purpose is over it's in this body even though it's a body of death even though we get sick all the time even though there's sadness in this body struggles there's hurt and there's pain yet this is where it matters the most this is where you'll know if you were there in the beginning and you'll be there in the end on how you use this body amen amen so San and the devils are essentially in this earth illegally they are spirits roing around the earth you don't see a body you you you never see you never see an angel try to dwell in a person they don't need to but why do these Devils want to attack the children of God want to try to dwell in them now this quote encapsulates this message he says in the greatest battle ever fought a devil is almost harmless unless he has something to work in well if he had a body he's not harmless if he had a body he didn't need to be roaming around but he's this Spirit Ephesians 2:2 it says wherein in times past we ye walked according to the course of the world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience he governs the air he's the prince of the power of the air and he didn't say the angel he said the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience in Luke 11 2426 it says you know what we I'll just um say it but jot it down it says when an clean spirit is gone out of a man what does it do it goes and wanders around it goes into the Bible says dry places seeking rest now now God asked this question he he said um the throne is or the heaven is my Throne the Earth is my foot stol but what is the place of my rest God's trying to seek rest what are these Devils trying to do the Bible says going through Dry places seeking rest and when they can't find anywhere else they go to and fro from the earth he says I'm going to go back to my house this body he said I'm going to go back to my habitation and whenever he goes to that place he sees that house that body all empty all clean and he says oh I'm going to bring my buddies in and he says he's eight times worse than he was when he that's what the these Spirits are they're trying to find a habitation because because this body is meant to be operated with by the spirit if if a a demon could just materialize then he could just cause Havoc with Humanity but he and he wouldn't be uh constantly looking for a human to live in but they they're trying to find the children of God because this is where the kingdom of God lies the devil he wanted a greater Kingdom than Michael and whenever God brought all the kingdom to heaven or to Earth he said I'm going to set my kingdom in the heart of man and the the devil says I want that Kingdom now now to go quickly why does Satan why does he have a right why does he have a right to to go into a person who is the temple of God and destroy their lives why does he have that right how can he do that now brother brandham says this now now whoever wants the quotes please come to me and I'll give you my whole message in in the message Ephesian uh the Ephesian Church age in the the seven Church age book brother brandham says this now why did it have to be so why did why was it that that seed of the serpent must come this way he says Man was created for God man was to be a temple of God the place of God's rest the Holy Spirit was man the temple acts 7 46-51 he says who found favor before God and desired to find a tabernacle for uh for the for the god of Jacob but Solomon built him an house how be it that the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as sayith the prophet is my throne and Earth is my foot stol what house will you build me sayith the Lord or what is my place of my rest hath not my hand made all these things yeff stiff necked uncircumcised in hearts and ears he always always resist the Holy Ghost as your father's did so do ye brother bham says Satan has known this all along he knew that man was supposed to be a temple he also wants to indwell man even so even as God does but God has reserved that right for himself see the devil devil wants to to dwell in man but God reserved that right only for himself Satan cannot do that God Alone appeared in human flesh Satan could not um could not and cannot do that he does not have creative Powers the only way Satan could accomplish what he wanted to do was enter the serpent in Eden even as he entered by evil spirits into the swine of GAD so he couldn't enter into man so he found the best thing he he studied the serpent he studied this man and he said I can enter into that God does not enter into animals but Satan can and will accomplish and will and will to accomplish his ends he could not have a child directly by Eve as Mary as God did by Mary so he entered into the serpent and be beguiled Eve he seduced her and and by by her did Satan have a child vicariously Cain bore the full spiritual characteristics of Satan and the animalistic Central fleshly characteristics of the serpent no wonder the holy spirit said that Cain was of that Wicked Woman he was that's how he got in he continues on he says the fall would be caused by Satan had to have flesh to make fall Satan had to come through flesh also but Satan could not come through human flesh to make the fall as Christ come into the human flesh to restore the Fallen but there there was an animal the serpent so close to man that Satan could get into that beast and through that Beast he could um get to the human get to the human flesh and cause the fall and inject himself thereby into the human race he injected himself into the human race and that's why the devil can tamper with us that's why he has the right because Satan uh beguiled the Through The Serpent and the full image of Satan the image of the Beast was in that Serpent and whenever the the the blood it transferred through the children it had all the characteristics of Satan and and and whenever the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were fair in Noah's time that brother bam says that's when there was a great mixup a and God had to destroy the whole earth because God's pure seed was being corrupted by the serpent seed and as they went through the ark there was there was women that was pregnant with children that had the serpent seed and that serpent seed went through the whole human race that seed of the devil that n that nature and now the devil has a right to come and knock at your heart and try to beguile you so that he could dwell in the children of God he has that right now and then that's why I wonder why why Satan contended for Moses's body maybe because he said I have the right that's my body I I deceived so that I can have that body says that this old feeble body that it belongs to Satan he sends that says that in the message the true sign that's overlooked and what he tries to do with his body is he'll allow it to to fall on the ground and let the skin worms and the bugs eat it and then he'll go to the next person and destroy that flesh with disease and then destroy the other flesh that's why he's here but in closing God he was too great to receive to go into the human body he he he was hiding himself in in Badger skins he was hiding himself in these temples built with man's hands God the devil took that right and God was too holy to dwell in us now his Spirit was too holy to to even be around but going back to Colossians he says we were alienated we were enemies in our mind and in our works but in the body of his flesh through death he presented us unblameable and unreprovable God had to come the legal way brother brandham said that the greatest gift that was ever given the greatest Christmas gift ever given to humanity was wrapped in a little baby it Michael and Gabriel they said your children your children are lost the devil does anything they want to do with them God says this takes a man-sized job I'm not going to send an angel I'm not going to send my great spirit but I'm going to go into a body and brother B says Thou was the greatest Christmas gift ever God wrapped in a little baby all of the Jews all of the people were waiting for God Waiting for God to come down into chariots but God came down in a little feeble body and the people said it's him it's this person not knowing it's all of eternity dwelling in a human body that's what God's gift to us that God was returning back us to our original condition and whenever he went up on the cross brother Bram said that that human flesh that was was was veiling the almighty God that wrapping paper that WRA that wrapped all of God he said it rented into it opened up and he said The Mercy Seat has been opened now God's spirit can dwell in his people now God can his mystery can dwell in you you can have a spirit and you can be an overcomer and whatever the devil tries to do God can be hiding just like the devil did all these years he tried to hide in flesh now God is hiding in flesh and there was one day as you would like to stand with me there was one day this man he he was going over in a ship he was tired from preaching but he had a purpose to go to a certain place that place was called G Gad he said I need to go to that place and as he was there resting cuz he was tired of preaching the Bible says that all the devils in that little sea begin to to rumble and begin to create a storm for some reason they were trying to stop this man and all of his disciples were scared so they went and they woke up Jesus how could you be asleep in this time Jesus says oh you of little faith he go stands up on that boat it was just a body he wasn't this great strong man the omnipotence in there he said peace be still and all the storms quieted down and finally that little man stepped on that Shore that man was that was possessed with eternity itself and as he stepped off that boat if the musicians would like to come that little man stepped off that boat and right when he stepped off the boat there was a man possessed with many devils and he goes and he sees this little man but he saw what the disciples couldn't see see when God he said peace be still to the storm these people said what manner of man is this who is this man that even the storms obey him they didn't even know who it was but when he stepped on that ground there was a demon possessed man that knew exactly who it was finally God he was possessed with all of eternity this devil came to him began to worship him and he said why are you tormenting me why are you here and Jesus says what's your name he says my name is Legion because we're we're many we thousands among thousands and he says get out of that man see this was the first time since the fall of Satan where the devil was cast out again and now those that receive the spirit those that God is hiding in each and every one of those eyes those that are bearing Christ right now you have that same Authority you have that same Authority so when the Devil comes to tempt you can do the same thing I cast you out get out of here s in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we have that right because he put us back into that original condition oh Heavenly Father Lord I ask father oh that that mystery becomes more real to us Lord that Lord you're just not that person that hung on the cross anymore Lord you're just not that person of 2,000 years ago you're not even that baby that was in them manger father you're Christ in US Lord you are here this morning Father and whatever tormenting is going on in this place father I I cry out knowing father that you can cast out every devil that as we walk out that we can
