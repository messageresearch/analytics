[44:26] puedemos este domingo uh hopefully we

[44:31] and um and i i hope that there's a lot
[44:34] of questions surging in the young people
[44:39] that that if you have questions
[44:42] go to the ministers because
[44:44] ministers go to the pastures
[44:46] go to the elders
[44:48] and and
[44:52] yeah we have all the advice in the world
[44:56] we thank god that we have young
[44:58] ministers
[45:00] ministers we have ministers that have
[45:01] gone through this ministers
[45:03] ministers have gone through that
[45:06] and we have plenty of elders
[45:09] that they've gone through so much
[45:11] we should take advantage of all of that
[45:13] information
[45:15] let us not go to the wrong source
[45:19] fuente
[45:20] let us not go to the internet
[45:23] let us not go to our buddies
[45:25] amigos let's go right here at home vamos
[45:27] aqui en casa you have your parents
[45:30] and
[45:38] amen amen aren't you thankful that we
[45:40] have a church that's filled of of of
[45:42] food
[45:44] iglesias
[45:57] we don't have just one elder no solomon
[46:00] we have many of them
[46:02] and let's let's take advantage of that
[46:05] amen
[46:06] and this evening we like to speak on the
[46:08] sacred vowel
[46:13] last time we were here we spoke on the
[46:15] on confession
[46:19] and once that person reaches that stage
[46:21] of confession
[46:24] and they talk amongst themselves
[46:41] that they're telling you something and
[46:42] confidence
[46:44] is something that perhaps a lot of
[46:47] people don't know
[46:50] and they're trusting you to know this
[46:52] information
[46:55] and let's say that
[46:56] nothing works out between them
[47:04] usually i know we belong in the
[47:05] christian message church
[47:22] church
[47:24] are christians
[47:26] so let's just say they don't work out
[47:31] and the young man runs off and tells the
[47:33] whole church
[47:36] this young sister did this and she did
[47:38] that
[47:41] and she tells her and he tells her mom
[47:44] and the mom tells that sister
[47:48] says you know what that young girl did
[47:53] and she went with that old man
[47:55] she did this that young man
[47:58] should not be doing that
[48:01] a man amen
[48:03] and if he tells his mom
[48:07] that mom should be a christian
[48:10] christian and should tell that son
[48:13] son
[48:15] things didn't work out
[48:17] what she told you pero lo que ya
[48:19] espresso was with trust
[48:22] don't tell anyone
[48:25] man amen vice versa with the young lady
[48:28] vice versa
[48:29] don't start to tell what the young man
[48:31] did this
[48:33] why because the temptation is going to
[48:35] come
[48:37] then the people the church says why
[48:39] aren't you guys together anymore
[48:43] why aren't you guys together
[48:44] juntos well because he did that no nope
[48:48] and he was with this and we're doing
[48:49] that
[48:50] because he confessed to me
[48:53] now the best thing that you should say
[48:56] he said that god just god showed us that
[48:58] we shouldn't be together
[49:14] i hope that the day of tomorrow that
[49:15] doesn't happen
[49:18] the only one that if you will confess is
[49:20] to the wife that you do end up being
[49:22] with
[49:23] confess
[49:26] so once once you once you reach that
[49:29] stage
[49:31] and and it's really beautiful that
[49:33] everything is coming out great yes
[49:37] we come where a lot of people they love
[49:39] this stage
[49:51] i have the definition there of
[49:52] engagement
[49:55] it says it's a formal agreement to get
[49:58] married
[50:01] amen
[50:02] so what should you do what should i the
[50:04] the couple should be doing before
[50:06] getting to this stage
[50:11] of course they should be praying
[50:12] earnestly uh claro de monstar orlando
[50:15] talking to his pastor to see if this is
[50:17] the right time to do this
[50:22] the young man should already be born
[50:23] again and with maturity
[50:35] you should be confident that that she is
[50:37] the wife that god has predestinated
[50:52] and financially
[51:14] what should we do what should that
[51:16] couple do when they're in that stage
[51:25] you know that's a very delicate stage
[51:27] right there
[51:29] you know it's it's something that you
[51:31] guys should be very careful
[51:34] there's a way how you should do things
[51:37] to to start that stage
[51:42] the young man
[51:43] shouldn't go and just give her a ring
[51:45] and pop up to her parents house and say
[51:47] hey we're getting engaged we're getting
[51:48] married
[51:57] you shouldn't just give them the ring

[56:53] if you like a daughter her and her dad
[56:55] is a little bit of a tough guy
[57:00] and his dad doesn't want to let the
[57:01] daughter go
[57:04] the pastor's going to come el pastor
[57:07] brother johnny got there manoj
[57:09] started talking in this
[57:32] but here he ain't even talking and he's
[57:33] trembling
[57:38] so then i asked permission
[57:41] and that's where we we we rearranged the
[57:43] blessing for us to get engaged
[57:50] i hope you're taking these nuggets and
[57:52] and you apply it
[57:56] so please don't don't don't take the
[57:58] young lady don't go to las vegas
[58:03] and get married
[58:05] do things right
[58:33] so they can see they can base themselves
[58:35] not an example of a minister
[58:39] or because the pastor did it
[58:41] no they did it because mom and dad
[58:43] didn't know hey
[58:45] that's the best sermon you can give your
[58:47] son porcelain
[58:58] so there is that's that's your goal it
[59:00] is
[59:01] is it for us to have uh to start off
[59:03] right
[59:06] and i'm just going to insert this
[59:09] you know
[59:10] i'm going to backtrack a little bit
[59:13] a good interesting question how long
[59:15] should this stage last
[59:20] not more than a year no mas du nano not
[59:23] more than a year no mas du nano and
[59:25] brother bernie would would uh
[59:27] have the engaged couples
[59:33] if it was more than a year it was for
[59:34] certain reasons
[59:38] but it was no more than a year
[59:40] that's why that's why you should already
[59:42] be getting financially ready way
[59:44] beforehand foreign
[59:48] don't start getting financially ready
[59:50] once you get the ring to her no
[59:52] preparation
[59:55] start getting ready way before that
[1:00:04] why because then the temptations begin
[1:00:05] to come
[1:00:08] then the devil starts to creep in diablo
[1:00:12] you're technically
[1:00:54] it's not technically
[1:01:08] yeah amen amen oh i think there should
[1:01:11] be someone
[1:01:15] man amen
[1:01:17] man i hope you still love me
[1:01:20] they're in that stage
[1:01:22] when the young
[1:01:38] amen let's go to our scriptures in
[1:01:40] genesis 24.
[1:01:44] everything that we're saying
[1:01:47] basing them off to the scriptures
[1:01:50] we're basing
[1:02:04] we want to base it off the scriptures
[1:02:07] genesis 24 29.
[1:02:11] and this is we're going to take off here
[1:02:13] when we i think we spoke on the third
[1:02:15] message
[1:02:19] we're here with uh isaac and rebecca
[1:02:21] konisaki rebecca when eliezer was
[1:02:23] finding the wife for isaac
[1:02:28] where we left off is where where
[1:02:30] eliezers saw the servant saw that that
[1:02:33] the rebecca did what he prayed for
[1:02:39] and god has prop prospered his way
[1:02:44] so here that's what we're going to take
[1:02:45] off where we left off yeah
[1:02:48] and rebecca had a brother and his name
[1:02:50] was laban and laban ran out to the man
[1:02:53] ran on to the man onto the well
[1:02:55] rebecca
[1:03:01] it came to pass when he saw the earring
[1:03:03] and the bracelets upon his sister's
[1:03:04] hands and when he had heard the words of
[1:03:06] rebecca his sister saying
[1:03:08] thus spake the man unto me that he came
[1:03:11] unto the man and behold he stood by the
[1:03:12] camels by the well
[1:03:14] if
[1:03:29] putting down in my notes
[1:03:32] the earrings and the bracelets
[1:03:39] now i'm that's just my thought to you
[1:03:42] our smith
[1:03:48] he said come in thou
[1:03:49] thou blessed of the lord wherefore
[1:03:51] stands thou without for i have prepared
[1:03:53] the house and the room and room for the
[1:03:55] camels
[1:04:04] and the man came into the house and he
[1:04:05] ungerted his camels and gave straw and
[1:04:08] provender for the camels and water to
[1:04:10] wash his feet and the men's feet that
[1:04:12] were with him
[1:04:27] and there was set meat before him to eat
[1:04:29] but he said i will not eat until i have
[1:04:31] told my aaron and he said speak on
[1:04:34] it
[1:04:42] so there are my notes i put that he's
[1:04:44] going to start confessing
[1:04:48] that's what we said earlier in the past
[1:04:50] messages
[1:04:52] there's going to
[1:05:06] you can say that
[1:05:09] that's why we're entitled at the sacred
[1:05:11] vowel
[1:05:14] that's we're going to find out what
[1:05:15] happens if you don't and what happens if
[1:05:17] you tell her everything and you don't
[1:05:18] even end up with her vamos a uh
[1:05:32] said i'm not going to eat yet until i
[1:05:34] tell you why
[1:05:49] and we're telling up because abraham was
[1:05:51] a renowned name by that time
[1:05:56] he knew who abraham was yes
[1:05:58] that god blessed abraham
[1:06:00] he said i am abraham's servant
[1:06:08] so whenever you go to that young lady's
[1:06:10] family
[1:06:13] you might not come from a family of
[1:06:15] renowned names
[1:06:39] the lord had blessed my master greatly
[1:06:42] and he has become great and he has given
[1:06:44] him flocks and herds and silver and gold
[1:06:47] and men servants and maidservants and
[1:06:49] camels and asses
[1:07:11] how prepared he is financially
[1:07:17] he's telling all the natural all the
[1:07:19] physical natural things they have
[1:07:24] hey man i think that's where there's no
[1:07:25] excuse for a young man
[1:07:36] my mother she worked as a janitor in the
[1:07:39] school my mother
[1:07:42] and what i did i remember one summer
[1:07:46] that there was a teacher in the school
[1:07:47] that she worked at establishment
[1:07:50] she needed help to move her things from
[1:07:52] a classroom to another classroom
[1:07:56] my mom said well i have my son he's
[1:07:58] about 12 years old he can help you my
[1:08:00] mother
[1:08:03] didn't i didn't do it to get paid i just
[1:08:05] did it my mom told me to do it so i want
[1:08:07] to stay home
[1:08:34] my mom she's the type of person that she
[1:08:36] kind of thinks or she speaks what she
[1:08:38] thinks
[1:08:42] and and she always took us to church an
[1:08:44] hour early before church even started
[1:08:50] then we live about 10 minutes away from
[1:08:52] the church
[1:08:56] i was a young kid that you can imagine
[1:08:57] me i didn't want to be there
[1:09:01] she started getting her check and she
[1:09:03] started talking empathy
[1:09:18] heart
[1:09:21] because we would never go out to eat
[1:09:22] nunca
[1:09:24] we always eat at home simply
[1:09:26] and she said
[1:09:27] i'm going to take 30 out of the thais
[1:09:31] when i get paid again next week
[1:09:37] but i'm going to add the 30 that i took
[1:09:39] out this week
[1:09:42] when i saw that

[1:10:04] this very day has ever told me that
[1:10:07] when i got my first check
[1:10:10] now you might believe me you might not
[1:10:12] know
[1:10:13] obligated to tell you the truth
[1:10:28] and i gave my mom all my checks
[1:10:34] my mom was a janitor
[1:10:37] i had a brother i have a brother and i
[1:10:39] have a sister
[1:10:41] my dad was an alcoholic my father an
[1:10:43] alcoholic now he's an uh he's the usher
[1:10:45] he's an usher of the church
[1:10:47] by god's grace
[1:10:49] we don't have any money no
[1:10:51] we didn't have money to get close to
[1:10:52] school
[1:10:54] we don't have money to go out to eat
[1:10:58] young man you see your mom
[1:11:01] you see that she irons and she cooks
[1:11:04] i gave her all of my checks
[1:11:08] if you want to know how to prosper in
[1:11:09] your life
[1:11:17] and you're never going to go hungry
[1:11:21] is that a promise for me
[1:11:24] no that's the promise of god this is
[1:11:25] promesa
[1:11:26] come straight from god
[1:11:29] and god is my witness all right
[1:11:31] i never had to struggle
[1:11:35] a young man a young sister
[1:11:52] so we're going to skip 36-46
[1:11:59] is there the servant is telling the
[1:12:02] family
[1:12:05] all the things that happen when abraham
[1:12:08] told him what to do
[1:12:13] that he needed to swear and to promise
[1:12:18] so we're going to take off from verse
[1:12:19] 47.
[1:12:22] and he says and i asked her and said
[1:12:23] whose daughter art thou and she said the
[1:12:26] daughter of bethuel and a son who
[1:12:28] milked a bear onto him and i put the
[1:12:30] earring upon her face and the braces
[1:12:32] upon her hands
[1:12:34] and says
[1:12:48] i bowed down my head and worshiped the
[1:12:50] lord and blessed the lord god of my
[1:12:52] master abraham which he had led me the
[1:12:54] right way to my master's brother's
[1:12:55] daughters onto his son
[1:13:30] the first thing i did was i prayed
[1:13:33] and the first and the next thing i saw i
[1:13:34] saw rebecca come out
[1:13:37] and rebecca gave me the drink
[1:13:40] and she drank all my and she fed all my
[1:13:42] camels
[1:13:44] what do you
[1:13:52] now if you would deal kindly and truly
[1:13:54] with my master tell me
[1:13:56] and if not tell me that i may turn to
[1:13:58] the right hand or to the left
[1:14:12] then laban and bethu answered and said
[1:14:15] the thing proceedeth from the lord we
[1:14:18] cannot speak unto the good bad or good
[1:14:21] entonces
[1:14:40] cause truly this comes from the lord
[1:14:44] amen don't don't you expect that
[1:14:48] don't you want to get to that position
[1:14:51] and it comes from the lord
[1:14:53] where it doesn't come from man
[1:14:56] that god has given you the wife
[1:14:58] god has given you the husband
[1:15:01] it says this thing proceeded from the
[1:15:03] lord
[1:15:05] and verse 51
[1:15:07] behold rebecca is before thee taker and
[1:15:10] go and let her be let her be by thy
[1:15:12] master son's wife as the lord has spoken
[1:15:21] and it came to pass when abraham's
[1:15:23] servant heard the words he worshipped
[1:15:24] the lord bowing himself to the earth
[1:15:34] now let's jump to verse 55.
[1:15:38] and her brother and her mother said let
[1:15:39] the damsel abide with us a few days at
[1:15:42] least at least ten
[1:15:44] after that she shall go entonces
[1:15:53] and he said unto him hinder me not
[1:15:55] seeing that the lord has prospered my
[1:15:56] way send me away that i might go to my
[1:15:59] master.
[1:16:08] that's why again we talk about the
[1:16:10] engagement
[1:16:12] that stays shouldn't last too long
[1:16:16] and i know for parents that might hurt a
[1:16:18] little bit it might sting a little bit
[1:16:23] i'll get engaged for two three years
[1:16:28] one more not more than one year
[1:16:32] verse 57
[1:16:34] and they said
[1:16:36] we will call the damsel and inquire her
[1:16:39] at her mouth
[1:16:47] here's a very important verse
[1:16:50] it doesn't matter how many signs you
[1:16:52] have
[1:16:54] that you prayed for the young lady and
[1:16:56] thunder came down
[1:16:59] and then she came in walking like that
[1:17:01] and you saw the miracle from god
[1:17:06] and you talk to the to the father
[1:17:08] talk to the pastor
[1:17:10] the dad might say yes
[1:17:13] but what does she say
[1:17:18] man amen that's the important thing
[1:17:21] that's what she says
[1:17:24] let's bring the damsel and let's see
[1:17:25] what she says
[1:17:29] they called rebecca and they said
[1:17:30] ontario will thou go with this man
[1:17:34] iran
[1:17:37] and she said i will go
[1:17:40] amen so let's let's go here we'll see
[1:17:43] what brother branham says
[1:17:45] a very well-known quote that a lot of
[1:17:48] young men know
[1:17:52] the ram says a young man asked me the
[1:17:54] other day
[1:17:57] do you think i you think i could or
[1:17:59] ought to get married brother branham
[1:18:04] and such a girl
[1:18:06] how much do you think of her
[1:18:09] cuanto las timas he said oma
[1:18:13] well if you're not going to l if you're
[1:18:15] not going to live without her you better
[1:18:17] marry her then
[1:18:22] but if you can live without her you
[1:18:23] better not perosis
[1:18:27] but if it's going to kill you you better
[1:18:29] go ahead and get married
[1:18:35] i guess that's what happens a lot when
[1:18:36] the young person comes to the pastor's
[1:18:38] office
[1:18:48] the young man never listens to the tapes
[1:18:50] of brother branham
[1:19:20] a lot of people take that quote and they
[1:19:22] run with it
[1:19:25] no let's finish all of our food
[1:19:28] let's finish our plate
[1:19:31] brother ram says he said amanda branham
[1:19:34] and i said what i was trying to get to
[1:19:37] him
[1:19:42] if you love her so much because
[1:19:46] now right now
[1:19:47] in this moment before
[1:19:51] [Music]
[1:20:03] and trials of life come in
[1:20:07] los angeles
[1:20:08] de la vida brother branham says amanda
[1:20:10] bryant if you can't live without her see
[1:20:12] no poison yeah marry her
[1:20:15] well the brand didn't even finish
[1:20:16] talking
[1:20:30] before you jump
[1:20:41] it says right now before you get married
[1:20:44] everything is
[1:21:12] wait a couple of months
[1:21:16] and he says
[1:21:17] it is that's when you got to be so in
[1:21:20] love
[1:21:21] yes
[1:21:23] you understand one another
[1:21:26] and you're just doing
[1:21:40] you got to
[1:23:16] brother branham what is the meaning of
[1:23:18] annulment elemental moment
[1:23:22] are people free to marry or this is just
[1:23:24] another word of the another word for
[1:23:25] divorce
[1:23:30] i would like some information on this
[1:23:47] if a boy promises the girl to marry her
[1:23:49] under good faith
[1:23:54] he's obligated to that girl
[1:23:58] my brother we're not in the altar
[1:24:00] is
[1:24:26] i'd rather him say it
[1:24:29] he's just as good as married her asico
[1:24:33] the only thing the law does is give him
[1:24:35] a bill of rights to live together
[1:24:40] to keep from being a common law husband
[1:24:42] and wife
[1:24:44] but when a man tells a woman
[1:24:47] i will marry you me
[1:24:50] i'll take you for my wife
[1:24:53] he's married
[1:24:55] your vow is
[1:24:59] that's that's what marries you anyhow
[1:25:03] there's no preacher that can marry you
[1:25:05] no
[1:25:06] no magistrate or anything else
[1:25:10] it's your own vow to god to this man
[1:25:16] you're married
[1:25:19] i'm going to say that again
[1:25:20] when you promise
[1:25:23] you
[1:25:23] are married
[1:25:30] let's not take this quote out of context
[1:25:35] there's a lot of times we can take the
[1:25:36] word out of context
[1:25:54] where everything is going to come to
[1:25:55] manifestations
[1:25:58] you are together no
[1:26:00] but it has to come to a time where it
[1:26:01] has to be finished
[1:26:06] it's the same thing here is
[1:26:08] let's just say i have a bunch of wood
[1:26:12] i have nails
[1:26:14] two by fours
[1:26:15] hammers
[1:26:17] i can say that's my house
[1:26:20] potentially
[1:26:39] that's why we should be very careful
[1:26:41] what we say
[1:26:44] and if you do tell a bunch of young
[1:26:46] ladies
[1:27:08] now marriage in one sense is a type
[1:27:15] the earthly marriage here is a type of
[1:27:17] the heavenly marriage
[1:27:22] celestial that's why i said that you
[1:27:24] might be married who are sitting here
[1:27:28] but how is your relationship with christ
[1:27:42] and it says let's rehearse at a moment
[1:27:47] the first thing there is
[1:27:50] there must be a decision made
[1:27:54] the first thing
[1:27:56] is in a natural marriage
[1:28:11] whether he wants the young woman
[1:28:14] there has to be a decision made
[1:28:18] and you have to make it you say
[1:28:20] she must be the only woman in the world
[1:28:22] that you love
[1:28:26] and he must
[1:28:53] there has to be so much love
[1:29:08] because that's the
[1:29:22] to let you down
[1:29:34] and then what's going to happen there it
[1:29:36] is
[1:29:49] and he must be the only man
[1:29:52] oh that young guy in high school that i
[1:29:54] used to think about oh it's
[1:29:57] high school
[1:29:59] oh this guy i thought i used to think of
[1:30:00] mexico oh este hope in the mexico
[1:30:04] only one man
[1:30:08] oh but that guy from work i remember
[1:30:10] that years ago and i should have married
[1:30:12] him
[1:30:16] and you're making the wrong decisions
[1:30:20] and that's the same way it is by making
[1:30:22] the decision for christ
[1:30:27] the first thing you have to do
[1:30:29] is make up your mind
[1:30:39] that's the first thing you got to do
[1:30:42] you're going to fall you're going to
[1:30:43] deal with this young man you're going to
[1:30:44] go with this young lady
[1:31:54] you got to make an engagement before
[1:31:56] this union can be us
[1:32:01] and that's the same way with christ
[1:32:04] the way with christ's church
[1:32:07] it has to be engagement with christ a
[1:32:09] pledge an engagement a love affair
[1:32:15] and then the next thing is
[1:32:17] promises
[1:32:21] to be a promise be made to one another
[1:32:26] the promise
[1:32:27] like that you make promise
[1:32:30] sweetheart
[1:32:32] if you marry me
[1:32:34] i promise that i'll be loyal and true
[1:32:37] prometo certainly
[1:32:56] it'll do it'll do all the duty as i'll
[1:32:59] do all the duty as a mother
[1:33:02] i'll be a housekeeper
[1:33:05] all these promises has got
[1:33:35] up
[1:33:39] and he said that this woman had a barely
[1:33:40] a husband that just got converted
[1:33:45] and he says
[1:33:48] he says i know you just got converted to
[1:33:50] christ
[1:33:52] and i know there's a lot of temptation
[1:33:53] out there in the world
[1:33:56] but if you fall pero
[1:33:58] and if you make a mistake
[1:34:01] don't you run away no
[1:34:17] say okay
[1:34:18] oh what a trust
[1:34:21] that if someone gives you that
[1:34:24] and how would you ever betray that trust
[1:34:28] someone would forgive you even if they
[1:34:30] told you if you
[1:34:46] if you make a mistake
[1:34:49] don't run away no
[1:34:50] oh we'll fix it right here
[1:34:54] you know what we say today
[1:34:58] if you go with another man
[1:35:01] if you go with another girl
[1:35:03] don't even come back home
[1:35:07] a man or a man a man or a man coc yes
[1:35:10] sir yes but this love this love that
[1:35:12] this lady had but
[1:35:43] why would i ever do something like that
[1:35:44] to him
[1:35:46] why would i do that to her
[1:35:48] it's impossible it's impossible
[1:35:51] for the ram says and that's the same
[1:35:52] thing when you come to christ
[1:35:54] he says lord if you receive receive me
[1:35:58] into your kingdom i promise senor
[1:36:00] receives
[1:36:02] there you are
[1:36:03] i love you
[1:36:05] i'll be true to you
[1:36:06] i'll serve you yo
[1:36:08] day and night
[1:36:14] too bad we forget that when we fall in
[1:36:16] love with christ
[1:36:20] serve you day and night
[1:36:51] that is and not from your heart
[1:36:55] you mean it definitely you're absolutely
[1:36:58] not living correctly with him
[1:37:03] it's it's a it's a kind of a
[1:37:04] crystallized affair
[1:37:08] look here if you have if you haven't got
[1:37:10] teeth
[1:37:12] and you have false teeth
[1:37:15] now that's all right
[1:37:16] it's substituting for the teeth that you
[1:37:18] once had
[1:37:23] but actually those teeth are not
[1:37:24] connected with you
[1:37:27] it's not a part of you
[1:37:29] if you had an arm amputated
[1:37:35] and you put a false arm on you
[1:37:38] well that arm is not actually connected
[1:37:45] see it's not connected with you
[1:37:48] and we take our pledge to christ
[1:37:52] we don't become a part of him
[1:37:55] like a woman ought to become part of a
[1:37:57] man and a man part of the woman
[1:38:16] and him 60 or 70 years old and you don't
[1:38:18] love him as good as you did in the
[1:38:19] beginning
[1:38:23] and you just really are raising his
[1:38:25] children
[1:38:28] that's the way the churches are
[1:38:31] too many today
[1:38:33] we're just taking the name of the
[1:38:35] christian church
[1:38:38] pretending to be the bride pretending
[1:38:41] when it's artificially condensed
[1:38:43] artificial we're not connected with
[1:38:45] christ in any way
[1:38:48] we're just putting it on
[1:38:51] somos
[1:38:52] well you can't put on christianity
[1:40:06] decision
[1:40:20] why want you to give applause to the
[1:40:22] lord jesus christ this evening
[1:40:26] amen
[1:40:29] come forward
[1:40:31] i hope you love the lord
[1:40:35] and i hope that if the ones who are
[1:40:37] married
[1:40:39] you're actually married with christ
[1:40:43] you're here because you love him
[1:40:46] you're married to your wife because you
[1:40:48] love her
[1:40:50] because i'm not brother i'm not with her
[1:40:52] because i'm scared to get divorced
[1:40:56] because i'm scared
[1:40:58] brother i'm not there with christ
[1:41:00] because i'm scared
[1:41:16] not because
[1:41:43] that's what we need to come to christ
[1:41:47] a young man he needs to come to christ
[1:41:49] and have the love of christ
[1:41:51] because i don't believe
[1:41:53] if a young man says
[1:41:55] if he doesn't know christ
[1:41:57] if he's not born-again
[1:42:12] and you did with
