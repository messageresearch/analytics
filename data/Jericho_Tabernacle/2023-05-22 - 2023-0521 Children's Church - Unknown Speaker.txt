[Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign ers we reached that point in service to introduce some speakers [Music] very special speakers our first Speaker today was actually our precious brother Mateo Alvarado and Mr primero De Los Angeles um can we read Acts 2 38 then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the rementions of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and then John 3 5 Jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and this of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God now the first time baptism was ever spoke of was spoke of by John the Baptist how many knows that to be true all right I'm going to lay it over here way over here John the Baptist and John baptized the people in the river of Jordan commanding them that they should repaint and get right with God and sell their goods and feed the poor and the soldiers be satisfied with their money and to get right with God how many knows that and then he baptized them in the river of Jordan not sprinkled them not poor them but if you don't believe it here's the let's just come find out if it isn't that baptism which is baptized immersed [Music] put under buried now the first time baptism was ever spoke of was there the second time baptism was ever spoke in of Jesus Jesus commissioned it Matthew 28 19. next time baptism was spoke of was Acts 2 38. now if we can find out what kind of now remember this is just 33 years after the inauguration of the church at Pentecost 33 years later there has been such a Falling Away unto Jude here under the inspiration of the holy spirit is sending the letter to the churches to earnestly content for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints now if we can only find out what kind of a faith the first Saints had then we can find out what kind of Faith to contend for is that right but we must remember what kind of Faith was it now let's just think about oh well the first thing a person ought to do is think of the first subject the first thing that we must do is to repent the disciples taught repentance water baptism Divine Healing resurrection of the Dead Madness man if it came soon of the power of the Holy Ghost signs and wonders spoke with tongues interpreted interpret tongues cast out Devils healed the sick open the blinded eyes saw Visions is that right well this is 1900 years and we're still contending for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints and God is confirming it water baptism does not save you as much as people's sometimes think it does water baptism is a calm and moration of the death burial and resurrection of the Lord it does not save you there there's only one baptism that's the Holy Spirit baptism there's water is only a type God bless you thank you [Applause] God bless you thank you brother Matthew for speaking um now to our next special speaker our precious brother brother Leo Robles Robles and crucial yeah best thing you could do Mr makes you a new person if you could please turn to Mark chapter 8 verse 35 and says for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospels the same shall save it by being born again you plant yourself in the correct spot with this you can grow to be a son of God let's say for example Kane he was religious had his own church and seemed like the son of God but in reality he never really cleansed all the all the bad stuff we need to have that personal connection I'd also like to turn to the scripture John chapter 3 verse 3 to 5. it says Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God nicodemia is saith unto him how can a man be born again when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born Jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man of water and of spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of God and the importance of being born again we replenish the soul and give to God once this happens we act and behave differently not only do we not do our old decisions or habits but we now see them as a sin and a wrong decision brother Branham says that you must be born again our old self dies and we are born again once we are fully cleansed there is a change in nature from our mental and physical bodies may have a wonderful evening God bless you [Applause] God bless you brother thank you brother uh Leo for speaking is now we actually have one more special speaker and now it's not me but before this uh this brother comes up I would like to read some scriptures now I brought my sword I hope you brought yours is can you please turn to the Book of Exodus Exodus chapter four capitulo cuatro chapter four the very first verse on and Moses answered and said believe me nor hearken onto any voice for they will say the Lord have not appeared unto thee is and the Lord said unto him what is that in thy hand and he said a rod is and he said cast it on onto the ground and he casted on the ground and he became a serpent and Moses fled from before it is hey man let's go ahead and pray amen please buy your heads Lord Heavenly fathers Lord and now is the time to hear a brother Speak Lord I asked you to open the ears everyone here open the hearts so whatever the brother is is trying to say may he impact everyone here Lord asks you to bless him Lord the name of Jesus Christ amen amen now I'd like to introduce our brother Moses if you don't know who I am my name is Moses I have a question for the Children First okay who likes my rod it's a really nice Rod right I said let my people go wait this is the wrong one I'm sorry I'm sorry I just went fishing sorry let my people go this is my rod do you like my rod well I want to tell you a little story that there was one time that God wanted his people out of slavery they were in the land of Egypt they were enslaved by I said oh look at the stick I said I'm not going to be an Egyptian no more I'm not going to be the greatest in Egypt I'm just going to be a shepherd so I took this old dry stick it didn't mean anything maybe it came from an olive tree or some other kind of Branch but I took it and I became a shepherd and sometimes I would have to have to hit my sheep sometimes I had to guide them nice and gently but that's what I did with this other burning bush this Burning Bush wasn't being consumed by the fire oh okay and I said yes Lord he said I forgot even how to talk all I talked to was sheep slams some Sometimes some goats but that's all that was my language that was my language I said Lord I can't speak and if I do go over there they're not going to believe me I was scared I wasn't I Was 80 years old I was scared I said they're not going to believe me Lord they're not going to listen they're not going to think that God is with me and God he turned to me and he said what is in your hand he said Lord it's just my dry old stick it's just my rod I use it for the the Sheep I use it for walking I'm getting a little old Lord he said cast it on the ground casted it on the ground and it became a snake can you believe that it became a snake and I I got so scared I began to run from it and God says go and pick it up from the tail now if anybody has handled snakes I've handled many you don't pick a snake up from the tail no it's just gonna bite you it's going to turn around and bite you you have to grab it from the head but God says pick it up from the tail picked it up from the tail and it became my staff again and he said with this broth with this stick you are going to do Mighty wonders is that what this difference this stick insignificant stick I was I was about to switch it it's getting a little old but he said with this one when you stretch forth your hands great wonders are going to come forth I said yes Lord I'll do it yes I will go I grabbed my wife I grabbed my two kids and I was saddled up on a donkey people began to laugh and say what are you doing are you a one-man Invasion going to a greatest country in the world I said yes I am going to go and conquer the greatest nation that there was at that time wow but I was confident because I knew God was with me and he said that with this Rod he was going to do his mighty wonders and I went I believed him and sure enough I went to pharaoh and I said let my people go Pharaoh said no he said okay and he I went to the waters I put my staff in the waters and the waters turned all into blood I said wow this power in the stick the Pharaoh still didn't take him still didn't want to lose them I said let my people go he said no with my stick I called up frogs let my people go he said no I put my stick in the sand in boils and lice and all those things came forward until the power of God broke the kingdom the nation of Egypt with this little old stick said what a mighty stick but it wasn't the stick brother see you want to hold it it's just a regular stick but what the stick represented what this stick represented was the power of God that the power of God was with me and believe it or not I know your guys's prophet your Prophet is named William Miriam Brown and I heard him once and I heard him say that The Stick of Moses the rod the staff whatever you want to call it he said this old stick is the name of Jesus for us think about it you guys have a stick here today and it is the name of Jesus Christ and you can go wherever you want holding your stick holding that power that Authority which is the name of Jesus Christ Wherever You Go kids you go to school you go to your friends you go to church take the name of Jesus with you brother Branham I remember him saying if Moses let go of this stick and the Egyptians would have took it from them they would have had all of Israel whipped beaten because they took the authority away brother Branham says if he ever the devil ever takes the name of Jesus from the churches converts it to titles or whatever you want to call it he has the church whipped if you don't understand the power in the name of Jesus then we won't use it we hear many people they say the name of Jesus in vain they say oh Jesus but there's many people called Jesus I'm sure we have two three four five people in here named Jesus hi Jesus hi Jesus Wherever You Are but the name of the Lord Jesus Christ has power why because God all of God and all of his power every name that he had in the Old Testament is boiled down to that man named Jesus Christ Jesus was the one he was the one that paid your price when we didn't have no Authority we didn't have no power Jesus died for us and he took all the power in his name in his person and now he says in the name of Jesus you can cast out devils in the name of Jesus you can be healed sorry my beard is falling off don't pay attention to it please in the name of Jesus people can be healed in the name of Jesus God can help you with your schoolwork in the name of Jesus God can help you with the bully in the name of Jesus God can help you with whatever you need any trial any problem in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it has so much power the Bible says all knees shall bow at the name of Jesus he says you pray in my name and you'll see mountains move wow for you guys you can hold the name of Jesus with you that's yours you can hold the name of Jesus sister that's yours the name of Jesus is for you pass it to your buddy you're there the name of Jesus and for anybody that has courage to hold it and don't let it go don't let anything make you drop that name of Jesus you will hold it and as brother Matthew was saying you are baptized in the name of Jesus that's why we are baptized in the name of Jesus because as it has Power and Jesus Christ promised that he will descend down and live in your heart if you're baptized When you pray what's the last thing you say when after you pray okay amen in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I pray amen why because we want to finish every prayer everything that we do in the name of Jesus why because there's a person behind us saying I'll go with you take this Rod take this name and I'll go and you'll conquer Nations you'll conquer your sickness you'll conquer your habits you'll conquer everything you have in front of you people might laugh people might say you're crazy it doesn't matter take the name of Jesus with you breathe that holy name in prayer and you'll see miracles happen believe it who believes it I want to see Hands today oh my goodness how can we not believe it we've seen many miracles in the name of Jesus that name of Jesus many people are named Jesus but the name of the Lord Jesus Christ holds all of God's power in that name and God's word is in that name it represents his word so take his name you're taking his word that's all I wanted to say I wanted to give you a little testimony of my rock and let you know that each and every one of you have this same Rock if I could say you have something greater you have the name of God and you have it at your disposal not to say it in the in vain not to say it just to say it but say it with reverence say it with with sincerity and you will see the Miracles you will see things happen in your life amen can I hear everybody say Jesus that's power that's power and you have it for yourself that's all I wanted to say after this I'm going to be leaving I'm going to take my fishing rod because I don't want anybody to take it and we're going to have a newscast from Jericho children news so stay tuned God bless

see where the park and how to park and then down the center here you'll see these solar lights how they light up with the sun and looks so beautiful with all the energy it comes down from there and if you look way towards the back you'll see a real little parking lot where there's a basketball court a soccer court and a volleyball court and since we have put in this asphalt it has lowered our Energies not so many boogers coming up our noses but with all this we want to thank God for all the opportunities that you have given us and how he has provided for our church and everything that's it
