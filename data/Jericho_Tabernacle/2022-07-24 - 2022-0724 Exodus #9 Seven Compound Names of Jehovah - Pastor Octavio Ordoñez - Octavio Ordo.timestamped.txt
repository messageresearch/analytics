[57:06] here this
[57:10] morning so we're going to
[57:14] talk to the children this morning
[57:18] as well as the adults
[57:23] thought
[57:31] [Music]
[57:40] i'd like to clear up a couple of items
[57:46] and
[57:47] and that is the sos
[57:51] if you go to most churches of the
[57:54] message
[57:58] when you look up on youtube
[58:02] you'll find a couple of
[58:05] pictures

[58:34] [Music]
[58:36] paintings of them

[58:50] now the painting of jesus christ
[58:55] brother abraham said that was a very
[58:57] good likeness of jesus christ
[59:04] now to make it clear we don't
[59:07] worship
[59:08] or we don't pray to any images
[59:15] but i believe it's a blessing to have
[59:18] a
[59:19] drawing or a painting of the lord jesus
[59:22] christ in our building
[59:29] not only that you know
[59:32] it's also good to have it in your home
[59:33] that means
[59:36] the children say well what's that
[59:40] why do we have the
[59:42] drawing or the painting of our lord
[59:45] jesus christ
[59:46] in our home
[59:51] or in our church
[59:56] amen amen
[59:58] there's a reason for that uh are you not
[1:00:00] a son
[1:00:01] but not only that but
[1:00:04] we also have a
[1:00:06] picture
[1:00:08] and that's what i want to talk about
[1:00:10] today
[1:00:20] this is the sunday school
[1:00:22] dominical i'd like to speak a little bit
[1:00:25] of
[1:00:33] that's a
[1:00:35] a teaching that you get in high school
[1:00:49] these are questions that we need to
[1:00:50] answer for our children
[1:01:08] or maybe you pray to jesus christ and
[1:01:11] you worship an image
[1:01:16] we make this clear
[1:01:20] and teach it to our children
[1:01:37] now there's a
[1:01:39] book written
[1:01:42] it was written it's called the
[1:01:44] supernatural
[1:01:47] natural the life of william branham la
[1:01:49] villa la vida william branham has anyone
[1:01:53] uh seen this book algena vistas de libro
[1:01:55] antes there's six books i says libros
[1:01:59] and it's a tremendous tremendous
[1:02:01] help for you if you would read it yes
[1:02:06] it would be good if you read it to your
[1:02:08] children
[1:02:11] and let them know the life of our
[1:02:13] messenger of the prophet of the hours
[1:02:45] and how can we use that to help us today
[1:02:53] in
[1:02:55] could i ask you a question
[1:02:59] do you know what year that picture was
[1:03:01] taken
[1:03:10] it was taken in 1950
[1:03:13] photography
[1:03:28] and i'll read it to you so we can learn
[1:03:30] a little bit about this picture
[1:03:36] this picture was considered the first
[1:03:39] time in history is
[1:03:45] a supernatural light struck the lens
[1:03:51] and it was
[1:03:53] verified by the fbi if i look
[1:03:59] it was done before seven thousand people
[1:04:05] personally it wasn't hidden anywhere
[1:04:10] something that a
[1:04:11] big thing was made out of back in the
[1:04:13] 1950s
[1:04:18] it was so important to brother branham
[1:04:21] important
[1:04:22] that he mentioned it over a hundred
[1:04:24] times you know the same basis
[1:04:27] over a hundred times brother abraham
[1:04:29] mentioned this
[1:04:31] picture amazing
[1:04:34] and how it was verified
[1:04:37] so it's not something to shy away from
[1:04:40] nos algo de la cual no de vey
[1:04:42] it's something we need to be proud of
[1:04:47] something we should know
[1:04:50] part of our message is
[1:05:05] and we're not stuck in the old ages
[1:05:07] behind us
[1:05:12] there were six other churches
[1:05:16] but to us what matters is this church
[1:05:33] i'll read some parts of it
[1:05:38] it says finally
[1:05:42] felt
[1:05:42] strong enough to handle
[1:05:45] longer campaigns william branham
[1:05:48] sufficient
[1:05:58] his manager scheduled
[1:06:00] him for 17 nights in houston texas to
[1:06:04] administer
[1:06:06] programs
[1:06:07] in houston texas
[1:06:09] they started
[1:06:11] with 4 000 people
[1:06:15] but
[1:06:17] right away
[1:06:19] they got full say yeah
[1:06:21] so they moved to sam houston coliseum
[1:06:27] houston
[1:06:28] the second night
[1:06:30] they moved to sam houston coliseum
[1:06:34] now the average attendance was about
[1:06:36] eight thousand people in the second
[1:06:39] child
[1:06:51] but there was a baptist minister
[1:06:55] bautista his name was dr bess is
[1:07:00] he told his people not to attend those
[1:07:02] meetings
[1:07:05] sound familiar
[1:07:08] don't attend those meetings
[1:07:12] but
[1:07:25] so
[1:07:26] brother fred bosworth a secular man of
[1:07:30] fred bosworth
[1:07:32] he brought the newspaper to uh brother
[1:07:34] branham el trajo el periodically
[1:07:38] and he said he was challenging them to a
[1:07:40] debate it is
[1:07:55] elementa bosworth insisted uh insistia
[1:07:58] so he said okay go go ahead you can you
[1:08:01] can debate them
[1:08:05] they placed it in the newspapers
[1:08:51] he beat him with one question
[1:08:56] does anyone remember what that question
[1:08:58] was
[1:09:04] oh by the way the
[1:09:07] the message for today is called the
[1:09:10] seven compound names of jehovah
[1:09:29] was a redemptive name of jehovah's
[1:09:46] so he couldn't answer
[1:09:49] he asked them one question
[1:09:54] with one question
[1:10:01] now
[1:10:02] seven redemptive names
[1:10:09] jehovah jireh
[1:10:12] genesis 24 14
[1:10:15] means the lord will provide a sacrifice
[1:10:27] exodus 15 26 exodus king 76 the lord our
[1:10:31] healer
[1:10:34] jehovah nissin giovanni
[1:10:36] exodus 17 15 and exodus
[1:10:40] the lord our banner
[1:10:42] is
[1:10:55] jehovah
[1:10:56] raha psalm 23 1
[1:11:00] the lord our shepherd
[1:11:15] jeremiah
[1:11:16] 26 23 6 the lord our righteousness is
[1:11:29] ezekiel 48 35
[1:11:32] the lord is present
[1:11:38] is
[1:11:50] and he also gave him more scriptures
[1:11:54] i am the lord that healeth me
[1:11:59] exodus 15 26 in exodus in 76 who healeth
[1:12:03] all thy diseases
[1:12:07] [Music]
[1:12:14] when
[1:12:16] when even was come
[1:12:18] they brought unto him jesus
[1:12:27] and he cast out the spirits with his
[1:12:30] word
[1:12:33] healed all who were sick
[1:12:37] that it might be fulfilled which is
[1:12:39] spoken by isaiah's the prophet
[1:12:45] saying himself took our infirmities and
[1:13:04] and he came back was with the first
[1:13:06] corinthians dr bess
[1:13:09] uh started speaking on first corinthians
[1:13:11] chapter 15.
[1:13:16] corinthians
[1:13:30] so he got the camera man
[1:13:35] take these pictures
[1:13:38] pointy fingers at the prophet
[1:13:44] he put a fist under his shin
[1:13:49] take these pictures
[1:13:52] well after they took those pictures
[1:13:58] told the people well i i'm i'm this this
[1:14:01] uh debate is pretty much done now
[1:14:07] well we could ask brother branham to
[1:14:10] come over and dismiss the people uh
[1:14:19] but as you know he was up there on the
[1:14:21] third balcony
[1:14:25] and when he said
[1:14:30] brother abraham decided to go
[1:14:32] down to dismiss the people
[1:14:37] pueblo
[1:14:38] there's a pretty good note here
[1:14:39] yesterday
[1:14:54] he said he felt a blowing wind
[1:15:01] and he said okay now it's time to go
[1:15:03] down
[1:15:06] he said there were 500 ushers
[1:15:11] putting their hands together okay
[1:15:15] to guide them down
[1:15:19] no i don't think there was 500 ushers
[1:15:28] i believe they were angels of the lord
[1:15:36] giando
[1:15:50] see if i can find it
[1:15:53] encuentro
[1:16:06] he goes i'm no divine healer
[1:16:10] i never claimed to be a healer
[1:16:14] jesus christ is the only healer jesus
[1:16:16] christ
[1:16:18] but i will say this this morning
[1:16:23] i'm sorry but i will say this
[1:16:26] something supernatural happened the day
[1:16:28] i was born
[1:16:33] it was in a log cabin in the backwoods
[1:16:36] of kentucky
[1:16:40] the kentucky the little old who
[1:16:44] didn't
[1:16:45] have a floor
[1:17:01] a few minutes after i was born
[1:17:05] about five o'clock in the morning
[1:17:08] they pushed open that shutter hey yo
[1:17:13] in came the light lights
[1:17:16] circle the bed where mama and i lay okay
[1:17:23] since then i've learned that it's the
[1:17:26] angel of god this dentons is
[1:17:36] it comes into the meetings like a light
[1:17:39] entra
[1:17:41] and then i can
[1:17:43] and then i can see things about a person
[1:17:48] a persona sometimes about their past and
[1:17:52] make some sense about their future
[1:17:56] i challenge anybody anywhere to tell me
[1:17:59] one time where i have ever made a
[1:18:02] statement in the name of the lord that
[1:18:05] wasn't exactly true
[1:18:07] the way it was
[1:18:10] moment
[1:18:24] if
[1:18:57] the lord
[1:18:58] the lord jesus christ
[1:19:01] confirm what he said
[1:19:04] now that is something
[1:19:21] [Music]
[1:19:30] and we should teach it to our children
[1:19:38] that makes sense to me
[1:19:41] well
[1:19:43] the next or that evening
[1:19:47] they went out to develop the film
[1:19:53] listen this is really interesting here
[1:19:55] it was more interesting
[1:19:58] they developed the the the film
[1:20:02] uh in the first six
[1:20:06] pictures
[1:20:08] photography the first six ages
[1:20:12] they were all dark
[1:20:14] yesterday nothing
[1:20:30] it was taken to the
[1:20:32] us
[1:20:33] to the fbi
[1:20:37] this is what it says here yes
[1:20:39] the photo of the pillar of fire above
[1:20:42] william brenham's head was taken on
[1:20:44] january 24 1950.
[1:20:54] in the sam houston coliseum in houston
[1:20:57] texas in the coliseum houston in houston
[1:21:00] texas
[1:21:01] george j lacy examined the negative
[1:21:05] george j lacy examine negative for this
[1:21:08] photograph and concluded that it was not
[1:21:11] retouched but
[1:21:27] above william branham's head enzima de
[1:21:29] la caveza the william branham was a
[1:21:31] result of a light striking the negative
[1:21:34] era
[1:21:39] brother george j lacy tells brother
[1:21:41] bradham
[1:21:43] george j lacy ladies
[1:21:45] that this picture okay it's a photo will
[1:21:47] live on after him
[1:21:50] it'll be available on three cent stores
[1:21:54] uh estrada
[1:22:03] but today you can find this picture
[1:22:05] anywhere
[1:22:08] find it
[1:22:19] he told him it was worth about a hundred
[1:22:21] thousand dollars at that time
[1:22:37] there's a statement here also that's
[1:22:39] stating what uh george j lacy thought
[1:22:42] about this picture
[1:22:49] do you does anyone know where this photo
[1:22:52] is today
[1:22:56] is washington d.c it's in washington dc
[1:23:00] in the
[1:23:01] hall of religious art
[1:23:05] so it stands there today as a witness
[1:23:11] now this is the opinion of george j lacy
[1:23:15] is the opinion of george j lacy based
[1:23:18] upon the above described examination and
[1:23:21] study
[1:23:23] examination
[1:23:26] i am of the definite opinion
[1:23:30] on definitive that the negative
[1:23:32] submitted for examination
[1:23:36] was not retouched
[1:23:39] nor was it a composite or a double
[1:23:42] exposed
[1:23:43] negative
[1:23:48] further i am of the definite opinion
[1:23:51] that the light struck
[1:23:54] light streak appearing above the head
[1:23:58] in a halo position
[1:24:01] was caused by a light striking the
[1:24:03] negative
[1:24:05] opinion
[1:24:11] exposition
[1:24:28] show these books
[1:24:31] libros to your children
[1:24:34] i think they'll be blessed from them
[1:24:38] six books
[1:24:39] says
[1:24:44] now we can start our message for today
[1:24:49] what i wanted to talk about
[1:24:53] about those seven compound names is
[1:25:08] then it's up to us to know what those
[1:25:10] seven compound names are
[1:25:13] nosotros
[1:25:16] because we can do the same
[1:25:20] now
[1:25:23] as fast as we can
[1:25:33] now there was a poster before we started
[1:25:35] there was a poster of brother bradham
[1:25:38] avian
[1:25:53] that happened at that coliseum
[1:25:59] only one message was recorded
[1:26:04] that's according to
[1:26:07] the website es conforma alcite internet
[1:26:14] and the one that was recorded
[1:26:18] listen to the title
[1:26:20] the
[1:26:21] [Music]
[1:26:53] we only have one other service that was
[1:26:55] recorded
[1:27:00] in march 4th 1963
[1:27:12] in 1950 in carlsbad new mexico for the
[1:27:16] first time he talked about the light
[1:27:18] striking the camera
[1:27:21] in carlsbad new mexico
[1:27:27] camera to me these are interesting uh
[1:27:29] facts
[1:27:33] [Music]
[1:27:39] [Music]
[1:27:46] but later he found out that that city
[1:27:48] was run down and
[1:27:50] destroyed
[1:27:54] maybe not destroyed but dirty okay
[1:27:59] so to me that's what happens when you
[1:28:01] reject the word
[1:28:06] reject the word
[1:28:09] and you start dying now
[1:28:12] now let's see what brother abraham says
[1:28:14] here and why i pray for the sick aura
[1:28:22] 1954.
[1:28:26] and here not long ago in houston texas i
[1:28:29] was taken in a debate
[1:28:33] in houston
[1:28:36] where baptist minister came and said
[1:28:39] that i was a religious fanatic and not
[1:28:41] to be run out of the city
[1:28:49] you should do it
[1:28:52] i wouldn't fuss with them but
[1:28:54] mr bothwood
[1:28:56] taking the challenge
[1:28:58] and that night where thousands of people
[1:29:01] gathered in the sam houston coliseum
[1:29:03] they discussed it
[1:29:17] [Music]
[1:29:23] just asked in one question that settled
[1:29:27] it
[1:29:31] that said was was the redemptive names
[1:29:35] of jehovah applied
[1:29:46] he wasn't the lord's provided sacrifice
[1:29:55] he was in jesus christ the son of god
[1:30:00] were still in sin
[1:30:04] and if he was jehovah jireh
[1:30:07] he's jehovah rapha
[1:30:10] rafa also
[1:30:11] because they
[1:30:12] them compound names is inseparable
[1:30:20] jesus christ the healer jesus christ
[1:30:24] the same yesterday today forever
[1:30:29] so that that just settles it forever for
[1:30:32] once
[1:30:45] i wasn't supposed to be there but i was
[1:30:47] up in balcony 30
[1:30:50] wife and brother and i
[1:30:52] original
[1:31:00] and the angel of the lord came down
[1:31:03] uh comments uh and the angel of the lord
[1:31:06] come
[1:31:06] said go down
[1:31:08] 500 ushers put their hands together
[1:31:14] uh
[1:31:24] went to the platform i said i don't want
[1:31:28] to think heart of brother bass
[1:31:36] but has a right to believe that
[1:31:39] as a believer
[1:31:50] he doesn't have a right to to say the
[1:31:52] bible doesn't teach it
[1:31:57] because he hasn't got nothing to say now
[1:32:02] but i said i only testify the truth
[1:32:08] if i tell the truth
[1:32:20] so they had to
[1:32:22] the look
[1:32:24] life
[1:32:25] times colors and all those magazines
[1:32:28] there entonces
[1:32:32] live times colliers
[1:32:34] and the douglas studios of houston texas
[1:32:37] a member of the american photographer
[1:32:40] association shot the picture
[1:32:45] houston
[1:32:48] photographic americana one a catholic
[1:32:51] and the other one a jew
[1:32:56] took it in that night and developed a
[1:32:58] picture to see if it absolutely was
[1:33:01] authentic
[1:33:08] and the man had a heart attack when he
[1:33:10] looked at it
[1:33:14] the next day it was sent to washington
[1:33:16] dc copyrighted brought back and they
[1:33:19] sent
[1:33:20] and got george or george lacy which is
[1:33:25] the best unite best in the united states
[1:33:41] he's the head of the fbi in fingerprint
[1:33:44] and documents and he kept it in the
[1:33:47] shell building
[1:33:49] under observation for three days and
[1:33:51] called us
[1:33:53] all in and said who is reverend brenham
[1:33:59] department of documents
[1:34:17] like mortal beings but said as long as
[1:34:20] there
[1:34:21] there is a christian civilization
[1:34:24] your picture
[1:34:26] will live on
[1:34:29] us
[1:34:38] i've often said that with psychology too
[1:34:42] but the mechanical eye of this camera
[1:34:45] won't take psychology
[1:34:57] the light struck the lens it was there
[1:35:03] yes and so the picture now is
[1:35:05] copyrighted
[1:35:09] they
[1:35:11] of course they they sold it and
[1:35:13] everything else
[1:35:18] i get it from them give it out just as i
[1:35:21] get it
[1:35:26] and one hangs in washington dc in the
[1:35:29] religious hall of arts
[1:35:32] in washington d.c
[1:35:36] as the only
[1:35:38] supernatural
[1:35:39] being that's ever
[1:35:54] it was proven to be right
[1:35:59] and the critic was beat with one
[1:36:01] question
[1:36:04] aren't you glad you believe this message
[1:36:06] of the hour
[1:36:08] estimated
[1:36:25] back to eaton is wrapped in these seven
[1:36:28] redemptive names
[1:36:35] the first one being jehovah jireh
[1:36:39] which means the lord will provide his
[1:36:42] sacrifice
[1:36:46] the second one is jehovah rapha segunda
[1:36:50] the lord
[1:37:10] the lord is present tense the lord is
[1:37:14] present is
[1:37:21] let's review some of these
[1:37:23] uh
[1:37:24] while we still have some time
[1:37:29] number one jehovah jireh
[1:37:32] genesis
[1:37:39] if you remember remember genesis 22 is
[1:37:43] when abraham was going to sacrifice his
[1:37:45] son
[1:37:46] in genesis
[1:37:50] and i'll just go to genesis 22 14.
[1:37:56] abraham called the name of that place
[1:37:58] jehovah jireh
[1:38:00] as it is said to this day
[1:38:03] in the mount of the lord it shall be
[1:38:06] seen
[1:38:14] the lord provided a sacrifice
[1:38:18] jesus christ is our sacrifice
[1:38:24] philippians 2 25 and philippensis dos
[1:38:32] let this mind be in you which was also
[1:38:35] in christ who being in the form of god
[1:38:38] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:38:41] god
[1:38:42] is
[1:38:52] but made himself of no reputation and
[1:38:55] took upon him the form of a servant and
[1:38:58] was made in the likeness of men
[1:39:05] and being found in the fashion as a man
[1:39:08] he humbled himself and became obedient
[1:39:12] unto death even the death of the cross
[1:39:23] matthew 6 33 says but seek ye first the
[1:39:28] kingdom of god
[1:39:30] and his righteousness and all things
[1:39:32] shall be added unto you.
[1:39:43] amen
[1:39:46] now let's see what brother branham says
[1:39:48] about that situation with abraham
[1:39:52] abraham
[1:40:00] and when he was ready to obey god
[1:40:06] to its
[1:40:08] he cut his hand and said stay your hand
[1:40:11] abraham
[1:40:15] and there was a ram hooked in the
[1:40:17] wilderness
[1:40:22] around the vines and his horns
[1:40:26] on top of the mountain
[1:40:29] where there is lions wolves hyenas
[1:40:31] jackals and the great ferocious beasts
[1:40:44] and then he was way up on top of the
[1:40:47] mountain where there was no water
[1:40:51] in the
[1:40:51] mountain
[1:40:57] abraham had picked up stones all around
[1:41:00] to build an altar
[1:41:01] but there was the ram anyhow it was a
[1:41:04] paradox
[1:41:16] any man that believes god and takes him
[1:41:19] at his word
[1:41:27] no matter what the situation is
[1:41:34] [Music]
[1:41:45] the lord has provided himself a
[1:41:47] sacrifice
[1:41:50] he can still cause the paradox to happen
[1:41:56] he can do that this afternoon just take
[1:41:58] him at his word
[1:42:07] in exodus 15 22.
[1:42:12] and this is what led me to this message
[1:42:14] today
[1:42:20] exodus 15 22.
[1:42:23] so moses brought israel from the red sea
[1:42:26] and they went out into the wilderness of
[1:42:29] sure
[1:42:30] and they went three days in the
[1:42:32] wilderness and found no water
[1:42:34] eso
[1:42:37] del marojo
[1:42:43] and when they came to mara they could
[1:42:46] not drink of the waters of maura for
[1:42:49] they were bitter
[1:42:50] therefore the name
[1:42:52] of it was called mara
[1:43:01] and the people mourn against moses
[1:43:03] saying what shall we drink
[1:43:11] and he cried unto the lord and the lord
[1:43:13] showed him a tree
[1:43:16] which when he had casted into the waters
[1:43:19] the waters were made sweet and there he
[1:43:22] made for them a situation and an
[1:43:26] ordinance
[1:43:27] a statute and an ordinance
[1:43:30] and there he proved them
[1:43:36] all
[1:44:09] and said if thou will diligently shark
[1:44:12] into the voice of the lord thy god
[1:44:16] and will do that which is right in his
[1:44:19] sights
[1:44:20] and will give ear to his commandments
[1:44:23] and keep all his statutes i will put
[1:44:27] none of these diseases upon thee which i
[1:44:29] have brought
[1:44:30] from israel
[1:44:32] about egypt for i am the lord that
[1:44:36] healeth
[1:44:41] is
[1:44:59] the lord our banner
[1:45:06] there was a battle going on
[1:45:10] and moses had to lift up his hands
[1:45:25] so
[1:45:26] moses called that place that is
[1:45:46] [Music]
[1:45:54] let's go real quick to the next one
[1:45:58] jehovah shalom in juba shalom we're all
[1:46:01] familiar with that word
[1:46:05] the lord is peace
[1:46:08] lord our peace
[1:46:10] the lord is peace
[1:46:13] that's all in judges 26 21.
[1:46:18] i really like this scripture
[1:46:24] and gideon
[1:46:39] noise
[1:46:40] the biggest
[1:46:41] grande tallest
[1:46:43] one
[1:46:44] he picked a
[1:46:46] man
[1:46:48] and with that man he was able to defeat
[1:46:51] the armies of his time
[1:47:04] is
[1:47:10] judges 6 24 and just says
[1:47:14] then gideon built an altar there unto
[1:47:16] the lord
[1:47:18] and called it
[1:47:20] jehovah shalom unto this day
[1:47:23] it is yet an opera
