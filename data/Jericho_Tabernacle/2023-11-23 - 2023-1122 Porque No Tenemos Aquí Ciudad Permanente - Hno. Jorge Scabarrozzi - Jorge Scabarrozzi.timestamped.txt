[44:49] congregation I would like to bring forth
[44:52] the greetings from our brother
[44:54] ru
[44:59] and I'm very grateful that he permitted
[45:01] me to be able to come and greet each and
[45:03] every one of
[45:06] you I want to also thank brother
[45:09] Fernando palomares and his
[45:12] wife I am staying at his
[45:18] home and he has given me the gift of
[45:20] bringing me here with
[45:24] you
[45:26] and I found uh certain loved
[45:32] ones I haven't been here since
[45:39] 2019 many certain things happened that
[45:41] paralyzed the entire
[45:49] world and in this worldwide crisis I was
[45:52] found or stuck in the country of Mexico
[45:55] Mr
[46:00] and I was prohibited from returning to
[46:02] my home for 79
[46:07] days 79 days without seeing my loved
[46:09] ones my wife and my
[46:14] kids but in those 79 days it was very
[46:19] fruitful and I want to be where God
[46:21] wants me to
[46:23] be I don't want to be somewhere where
[46:26] God doesn't want me to
[46:29] [Music]
[46:30] be and I also want to greet my sister
[46:36] alv and her
[46:39] family may the Lord bless you beloved
[46:43] sister you are one of my
[46:49] heroes and after four years I'm finally
[46:52] able to tell you this eye to eye
[46:59] and we see that the Apostle Paul was the
[47:01] one that wrote the majority of the New
[47:03] Testament and he was also prohibited of
[47:06] his
[47:07] Liberty he was
[47:10] incarcerated and the devil hit him where
[47:12] it hurt him the
[47:14] most because he was a
[47:17] preacher and the devil and the devil
[47:19] ended up incarcerating
[47:24] him
[47:26] with the thought that this was going to
[47:28] stop the gospel
[47:32] from and I can imagine the Apostle Paul
[47:35] a little
[47:41] troubled and I can see him kind of
[47:45] suffering for his uh
[47:52] impedence I can see him when God tell
[47:55] telling him grab your pen and start
[47:57] writing and he started to
[48:00] write to write and then
[48:03] write 14
[48:06] letters the letters of
[48:10] Paul the one of the most important ones
[48:13] was the letter of
[48:15] Romans the letter to the
[48:21] Hebrews the letter of Hebrews was meant
[48:24] so that it would boost the faith of the
[48:26] newly
[48:28] converted to motivate them to not go
[48:32] back cannot go back to their old
[48:38] traditions and the enemy began his work
[48:40] since the very first
[48:45] age the Apostle Paul was preaching and
[48:47] also likewise was the
[48:51] Antichrist so then he began to write
[48:53] this beautiful letter
[48:59] and then when we come to see the 13th
[49:01] chapter of the letter of
[49:08] Hebrews and we can see that in this
[49:10] letter he provokes us to be doing good
[49:16] works he tells us to honor our
[49:19] pastor to invite their
[49:22] faith and to obey them
[49:27] but then he also tells
[49:32] us that we have nothing that's going to
[49:35] be permanent on this
[49:38] earth and the reason why I'm expressing
[49:41] this
[49:46] tonight it's because of things that I
[49:48] have gone through and I wish to share
[49:50] with
[49:54] you as a pre pracher of the Gospel I'm
[49:56] supposed to be with my w eyes wide
[50:01] open and I must learn how to sleep with
[50:03] my eyes
[50:06] open and I should always be
[50:12] alert and I should always be aware of
[50:14] what's going around in my
[50:18] surroundings because there are children
[50:20] of God that I must take care
[50:24] of
[50:26] as a man of God it's it's meant for me
[50:28] to be living a little bit
[50:31] higher I should be as a
[50:37] guardman so then if I see some kind of
[50:40] danger coming I should alert the God's
[50:45] people but then all of a sudden this
[50:47] covid-19 came
[50:49] along and it surprised each and every
[50:52] one of
[50:54] us and for me I got the shock of my life
[50:57] in the sister city
[51:00] of and then when I saw that I was
[51:02] prohibited going back to my
[51:06] country and then when I find that my
[51:08] country went into a humanitarian
[51:13] emergency and then when we begin to see
[51:16] each people dying one by
[51:19] one I began to judge
[51:22] myself and I began to ask myself
[51:26] why didn't I see
[51:28] it what was
[51:32] approaching what happened to me where
[51:34] did I drop the
[51:37] ball and then all of a sudden I was just
[51:39] thinking about my
[51:43] calling and then I found myself that I
[51:46] was more worried about con uh building a
[51:48] name for
[51:51] myself and I find myself that I was
[51:53] going losing my mind with in the
[51:55] missionary
[51:58] work I judged myself and I had asked God
[52:01] for
[52:06] forgiveness that I should have been
[52:07] aware of what was
[52:10] coming that I should have told my
[52:12] brethren
[52:14] be get
[52:16] ready begin to uh have
[52:22] storage but I was so worried in my
[52:24] calling that all of that just flew over
[52:26] my
[52:28] head and the Lord forgave
[52:31] me but he left me with some great
[52:37] lessons I've learned that things can
[52:39] change from one instant to
[52:43] another and I've learned that we are not
[52:45] owners of anything on
[52:48] here that we have nothing that will ever
[52:51] last forever on this
[52:54] Earth and I've come to realize that what
[52:56] I have right now is not even
[52:59] mine not even the things that I have
[53:01] seen are
[53:04] mine last year on the eth of
[53:08] March and I I saw a danger come to my
[53:14] life there was a couple of robbers that
[53:16] came under
[53:22] me and I was at the brink the point of
[53:25] returning back to the
[53:28] grave and I remember when they had taken
[53:30] me to the
[53:32] doctor there was about seven people
[53:35] waiting and I was
[53:39] bleeding and then all of a sudden they
[53:41] began to take my clothes
[53:45] off and never in my life did anybody
[53:47] know my nakedness
[53:50] only but I was there cleaning on to
[53:54] life
[53:56] asking God to give me another
[53:59] opportunity my wife my kids my
[54:03] mother give me another chance
[54:08] Lord and then in the clinic they had
[54:10] already taken off all my
[54:12] clothes they took off everything that I
[54:14] ever
[54:18] had my ring my watch and even my uh
[54:21] prosthetic
[54:24] teeth
[54:25] and right there I had
[54:28] learned that nothing is
[54:31] mine and then I began to ask
[54:35] myself if nothing is mine then why am I
[54:39] fighting if nothing is mine then why am
[54:41] I defending
[54:43] myself if nothing is mine then why am I
[54:45] claiming
[54:48] it if I if nothing is mine then why am I
[54:51] feeling
[54:54] jealous
[54:56] what what do I gain from all the fights
[54:58] that I've had if I'm going to leave or
[55:02] lose and I ask the Lord to give me
[55:04] another opportunity to live a different
[55:08] life I ask the Lord to give me another
[55:11] opportunity to walk a different
[55:13] way I have failed
[55:17] Lord I have clinged on to the worldly
[55:21] things and I forgotten that I am not of
[55:23] this Earth
[55:25] and I forgotten that I'm only
[55:27] a a
[55:31] pilgrim i' forgotten that this is not my
[55:34] Earth and that I have another one
[55:37] waiting and I ask the Lord permit me to
[55:40] stay
[55:44] here that I may be able to warn my
[55:46] family to not be worried so much about
[55:48] the
[55:51] world that I may be able to tell my
[55:52] family to not fight for the Earthly
[55:54] things
[55:55] [Music]
[55:56] right there at that
[55:58] clinic almost
[56:03] agonized I began to see life in a
[56:05] different
[56:08] manner my left leg almost
[56:14] gone and they had told me that I was
[56:16] going to be walking like a horse just
[56:18] trotting around my leg wasn't obeying
[56:23] me
[56:25] and I had realized that God wanted me to
[56:27] experience the
[56:30] quietness and I began to ignore all
[56:33] those negative thoughts that put me
[56:36] down I began to ignore the fear and
[56:42] Tremor I began to resist the devil By
[56:45] ignoring
[56:46] him and I began to learn how to
[56:53] stay began to learn how to deny my own
[56:57] selfish thoughts and
[56:59] ideas and God wanted me to
[57:03] learn and God wanted to show me that I'm
[57:05] not of this
[57:08] Earth and even though that I had already
[57:10] preached it a 100
[57:13] times it had never gone to be a
[57:15] revelation for
[57:18] me and I had come to realize that I I
[57:20] was only wasting my
[57:23] life
[57:26] and I began to see that I was neglecting
[57:28] that precious thing called
[57:32] life and I began to see that life was
[57:34] actually a
[57:38] present and I was just putting it to the
[57:40] side for vain and glorious
[57:44] things and vain discussions and
[57:51] disputes and I began to meditate on all
[57:53] those disputes that I had with with my
[57:58] wife and I began to meditate on the
[58:00] discussions that I had with my
[58:05] children and I began to meditate on the
[58:07] discussions that I had with the
[58:11] minist and all of my anguish and my uh
[58:17] anger and I began to see that life was
[58:19] just flowing out of my
[58:22] hands and I began to see that life was
[58:24] only made out of
[58:30] moments and I began to see that life is
[58:32] only just but a little Passage through
[58:36] eternity and I began to cry bitterly in
[58:38] the in the
[58:40] clinic for all the times that I had
[58:42] gotten
[58:45] angry for all the times that I began to
[58:47] get
[58:49] bitter for all the times that I had
[58:51] defended
[58:53] myself I began ask God to forgive
[58:58] me and I began to see life in a
[59:00] different
[59:02] Manner and then I realized the love that
[59:04] I never seen
[59:06] [Music]
[59:09] before and then I began to discover a
[59:12] love that that grew out of
[59:14] emergency and I knew that my wife had
[59:15] loved
[59:21] me but when I saw that I was dying I saw
[59:24] that the love of my wife began to grow
[59:28] tremendously and I began to see a love
[59:30] in my children that I never
[59:35] knew and I began to see the love in my
[59:37] brothers and my sisters and my mother
[59:39] that I never seen
[59:42] before and right there without even
[59:44] being able to Mo
[59:47] leg I began to thank God for giving me a
[59:50] second
[59:51] opportunity and I love to be alive
[59:57] and I love to feel the heartbeat of my
[1:00:00] heart and I love to
[1:00:04] breathe I love to see my wife my
[1:00:06] children and my own
[1:00:09] mother and I love to see the human
[1:00:15] being and I'm very grateful unto God for
[1:00:17] that second
[1:00:21] opportunity
[1:00:23] Brothers
[1:00:28] life is giving us
[1:00:31] lessons and today I visited the
[1:00:37] cemetery and I stood next to the grave
[1:00:39] of our brother Sergio
[1:00:43] Na and also our brother Betto
[1:00:48] Romero and also our brother L
[1:00:53] Ruiz and I also stood next to the grave
[1:00:56] of brother Bernie
[1:01:00] Garcia and I saw myself crying next to
[1:01:03] the grave of our brother Danielle
[1:01:08] Garcia and also of our brother Ezekiel
[1:01:17] Mor and I began to see all the
[1:01:19] Tombstones and all the
[1:01:21] graves and I began to ask myself what is
[1:01:23] life
[1:01:27] what is
[1:01:29] life life is a
[1:01:32] gift life is a
[1:01:35] present and we should take advantage of
[1:01:37] those
[1:01:38] moments to hug our
[1:01:41] wives to hug our
[1:01:44] children to hug our loved
[1:01:47] ones and to hug one
[1:01:53] another
[1:01:55] Brothers you have no idea how distru my
[1:01:57] heart
[1:02:01] is I love my brother Johnny Alvarado but
[1:02:03] it hurts me to not be able to see
[1:02:06] him and I love the bbas and it hurts me
[1:02:09] not to be able to see
[1:02:12] them and brothers God is giving us
[1:02:14] another
[1:02:17] opportunity and God wants us to learn to
[1:02:19] live
[1:02:23] life
[1:02:25] and brothers that the very thing that
[1:02:27] was preached onto US is already at our
[1:02:30] hands and everything is lining up for
[1:02:32] that special
[1:02:34] moment and us the God every God's
[1:02:39] people must align ourselves along with
[1:02:45] it and I come to realize that if time
[1:02:47] continues
[1:02:49] on that our heroes are going to abandon
[1:02:53] us
[1:02:56] and we've just suffered the loss of our
[1:02:57] precious brother Billy
[1:02:59] [Music]
[1:03:00] Paul and I couldn't realize that the
[1:03:02] light started fading
[1:03:07] away and darkness is starting to invade
[1:03:10] the world that which we live
[1:03:14] in and brother it's time to look at each
[1:03:17] other and
[1:03:19] ourselves and begin to examine our own
[1:03:23] selves
[1:03:25] and to go and check our motive and
[1:03:30] objectives and begin to ask ourselves
[1:03:32] how are we living
[1:03:35] life and my brothers I cry
[1:03:39] daily and being that I'm standing behind
[1:03:42] here I cry
[1:03:45] daily and it hurts in my heart for
[1:03:47] what's going on in my
[1:03:52] country and it hurts in my heart heart
[1:03:54] to see what's going on
[1:03:59] worldwide and it yearns in my heart to
[1:04:01] see the manifestations of the children
[1:04:02] of
[1:04:03] God beloved
[1:04:07] Brothers the same Lord with a shout of
[1:04:11] acclamation the shout of Angel
[1:04:15] and he shall descend from
[1:04:20] heaven and the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:04:23] first
[1:04:27] we're seeing the very first part of The
[1:04:28] Descent of the Lord Jesus
[1:04:31] Christ we're living in the
[1:04:34] acclamation in a t in a time of of
[1:04:37] learning a time of
[1:04:41] preparation come out of her my
[1:04:44] people and it's time for us to get
[1:04:48] ready and it's time to receive the
[1:04:51] message and it's time to live this
[1:04:53] message
[1:04:55] and as long as we don't do
[1:05:00] it then we ourselves are hindering the
[1:05:02] resurrection of those that are dead in
[1:05:03] Christ Jesus and those that remain here
[1:05:06] says the
[1:05:08] Bible sh not hinder the those that are
[1:05:13] asleep that I find out that if I don't
[1:05:15] surrender
[1:05:17] myself that I'm the one that's hindering
[1:05:19] that
[1:05:21] resurrection that I find out that if I
[1:05:23] don't die to my own
[1:05:26] that I am hindering the
[1:05:28] resurrection and the Earth is
[1:05:30] groaning
[1:05:34] moaning of the restoration of
[1:05:37] everything of what Earth are you
[1:05:39] speaking I am
[1:05:42] Earth something deep down inside
[1:05:45] me has to be
[1:05:47] groaning and crying
[1:05:49] out for the
[1:05:52] manifestation of the son of God
[1:05:55] which lives inside of
[1:05:56] me inside of
[1:05:59] me and inside of each and every one of
[1:06:02] you there's a child of God that lives in
[1:06:06] [Music]
[1:06:07] there that was created to the likeness
[1:06:10] of
[1:06:14] God and that for me creates a great
[1:06:19] desperation because time is at
[1:06:23] hand and the devil never
[1:06:26] sleeps and he knows exactly how to get
[1:06:29] to every one of us he knows where to hit
[1:06:33] us he hits me on a daily
[1:06:35] basis and he knows how to approach me
[1:06:39] and he knows how to approach each and
[1:06:40] every one of you he knows how to get to
[1:06:43] you he knows
[1:06:48] us after 6,000 years he's learned to
[1:06:51] examine man what is it that we have to
[1:06:54] do we must hide ourselves and clothe
[1:07:00] ourselves of the full armor of
[1:07:04] God because we have here no continuing
[1:07:07] City nothing is
[1:07:10] mine nothing is
[1:07:12] yours I'm not going to take a single
[1:07:16] thing all of our bank accounts so I'm
[1:07:18] not going to
[1:07:20] take all the precious stones gold and
[1:07:22] silver everything is going to stay
[1:07:28] properties everything shall be nothing
[1:07:31] but just
[1:07:35] fire I have 56
[1:07:42] years and after 40 Years of those I
[1:07:45] thought that this was
[1:07:48] me and then I come to realize one day
[1:07:51] that this is not really me I live here
[1:07:55] this is my
[1:07:56] home and it's fading
[1:08:00] away I look at inside the mirror and and
[1:08:02] I say to
[1:08:04] myself where have you
[1:08:07] gone and I began to get into a
[1:08:12] desperation because I begin to feel that
[1:08:15] my strength is going
[1:08:17] away and I've come to realize that I
[1:08:19] haven't preached
[1:08:21] enough and I've become to realize that
[1:08:23] haven't done
[1:08:27] enough I look in the mirror and I begin
[1:08:29] to see that my hair wants to turn
[1:08:34] white I begin to do the math and then I
[1:08:37] begin to see that I only have a few
[1:08:38] years left of
[1:08:39] life and it's much later than we
[1:08:44] think it's much later than we
[1:08:47] think only on this
[1:08:50] Earth do we have the
[1:08:52] opportunity
[1:08:54] to do something for the Lord Jesus
[1:08:58] Christ I didn't come to realize really
[1:09:00] what Pur was I only yearned to be
[1:09:05] happy I yearned to have a good
[1:09:08] marriage and I yearned to have a very
[1:09:10] good
[1:09:12] family and I long to be a very good
[1:09:14] church
[1:09:15] member and I yearned to be able to
[1:09:18] support the
[1:09:19] cause and i' never come to
[1:09:22] realize
[1:09:27] that each and every one of us has a
[1:09:28] responsibility given by
[1:09:32] God you and I have been given a
[1:09:41] responsibility and that responsibility
[1:09:43] is to preach this gospel to every living
[1:09:45] creature on the earth and I didn't
[1:09:49] know I was asleep in
[1:09:52] church
[1:09:57] and I didn't realize what my true
[1:09:59] responsibility was here on
[1:10:02] Earth you and I are
[1:10:09] responsible to lift up on high the torch
[1:10:11] of this
[1:10:16] gospel and God one day is going to come
[1:10:19] and ask us what we have done with our
[1:10:20] own
[1:10:22] lives
[1:10:24] God is going to come and ask us what we
[1:10:25] have done with our own
[1:10:30] time and God is going to ask me if I
[1:10:32] haven't given her the time that she
[1:10:37] deserves God will ask me what was the
[1:10:40] time that I've given to my
[1:10:46] children and God will also ask me what
[1:10:49] I've done with the time that I've given
[1:10:50] to my
[1:10:52] parents everything has its time the
[1:10:55] Bible
[1:10:55] says there is a time for
[1:11:00] everything God doesn't want me to give
[1:11:03] his time to my
[1:11:06] wife God doesn't want me to give away
[1:11:08] the time
[1:11:09] that is for my children and there's a
[1:11:12] time for everything and to
[1:11:16] see how things begin to line
[1:11:20] up I begin to get desperate with him
[1:11:24] I'm
[1:11:27] desperate that is the reason why I have
[1:11:29] come to this country once
[1:11:31] again after four
[1:11:35] years and God knows how much I longed to
[1:11:38] be here when
[1:11:42] brother but the humanitarian crisis did
[1:11:44] not allow us to be able to leave our
[1:11:49] country God knows how badly I wanted to
[1:11:51] be here when our brother passed away
[1:11:54] rero when our brother Betto Romero
[1:11:56] passed
[1:11:58] away when our brother naar passed
[1:12:04] [Music]
[1:12:05] away and when when our precious brother
[1:12:08] Bernie Garcia passed
[1:12:10] away I yearned to be
[1:12:13] here I wanted to yell out that I love
[1:12:19] them I wanted to shout the profound
[1:12:22] respect that I have
[1:12:25] every I want to shout that we should
[1:12:27] love one
[1:12:29] another and in this shall we know that
[1:12:31] we are children of
[1:12:38] God and I wanted to shout to the world
[1:12:40] that the life is going slipp out of our
[1:12:44] hands and we've been called to reflect
[1:12:47] that light of the
[1:12:50] even each and every one of us is a light
[1:12:53] when when I was a
[1:12:55] child when I was 15 years
[1:12:57] old I was already an
[1:13:03] orphan and there was nights that I would
[1:13:05] sleep
[1:13:08] with there was a day that I had walked
[1:13:10] over 8 kilom to my house I was very
[1:13:13] hungry I was
[1:13:16] hungry I didn't have no
[1:13:20] money and I began to walk looking down
[1:13:22] at the ground
[1:13:26] with the hope of finding a coin or some
[1:13:28] money to be able to buy some
[1:13:30] bread and then all of a sudden I found a
[1:13:32] a a piece of paper on the
[1:13:34] [Music]
[1:13:35] ground and when I lifted it up it
[1:13:39] said I live in a dark
[1:13:42] country where Darkness
[1:13:45] rains and in the darkness
[1:13:48] shame and the shame
[1:13:52] misery and in the misery a
[1:13:57] fist our hand willing to
[1:14:02] work willing to work to bring forth the
[1:14:05] light to this Dark
[1:14:07] Country brothers and
[1:14:10] sisters we live in a dark
[1:14:13] world where Darkness
[1:14:17] Reigns and then and the Darkness Reigns
[1:14:20] uh
[1:14:22] shamefulness
[1:14:27] misery and then the only hand that can
[1:14:30] give us the light once
[1:14:33] again are each and every one of us the
[1:14:35] children of
[1:14:36] God the world is getting
[1:14:40] darker and this doesn't mean that God is
[1:14:44] asleep God does not
[1:14:48] sleep the ones that are sleeping are us
[1:14:52] I am sleeping
[1:14:55] the preachers are
[1:14:58] sleeping because it's us that have been
[1:15:00] called
[1:15:03] to to lift up on high that torch of the
[1:15:07] Gospel it's each and every one of us
[1:15:09] that must bring forth the
[1:15:13] love it's us that should bring forth the
[1:15:15] mercy and
[1:15:18] love we're the ones that we supposed to
[1:15:20] lift the banner up high with what Grace
[1:15:22] is what is
[1:15:25] Grace it's a present or gift that is not
[1:15:28] worthy I didn't deserve
[1:15:30] Grace and you didn't deserve
[1:15:33] Grace but Grace had saved
[1:15:36] us and by Grace saving us
[1:15:41] automatically we ourselves become Grace
[1:15:45] I am
[1:15:46] Grace I am
[1:15:49] love and I am
[1:15:51] Mercy I am forgiveness
[1:15:54] and I am
[1:15:56] restoration everything that's in
[1:15:58] God is also inside of
[1:16:01] me and brothers I'm going to say it once
[1:16:04] again everything that is in God is
[1:16:07] inside of
[1:16:09] me everything that is
[1:16:11] God is in
[1:16:14] you I look like
[1:16:17] God and you look like
[1:16:20] God my children look like me
[1:16:23] and they must look like they are my
[1:16:28] children and when I say that I am a
[1:16:30] child of
[1:16:31] God in reality what I am
[1:16:34] saying is that I look like God within
[1:16:40] me there is a living creature that came
[1:16:43] out of
[1:16:44] God and one day it shall
[1:16:47] return and everything that is in
[1:16:50] [Music]
[1:16:51] God is also within that
[1:16:54] creature brothers and
[1:16:58] sisters this message is more than just
[1:17:02] words this message is much more than
[1:17:08] seron this message must be a form of
[1:17:13] living I must be the message made
[1:17:21] flesh each and every one of you called
[1:17:23] to be the
[1:17:26] message the greatest message preest is
[1:17:28] not one that has
[1:17:31] been the greatest sermon that preaches
[1:17:33] our own
[1:17:35] lives and with my own life I'm preaching
[1:17:38] to the
[1:17:39] people and when I don't
[1:17:42] forgive I am preaching that I do not
[1:17:44] believe in
[1:17:45] forgiveness when I don't do
[1:17:49] Mercy I am preaching that I do not
[1:17:51] believe in Mercy
[1:17:54] brothers and
[1:17:57] sisters we are called to live this
[1:18:01] message and the world is tired of
[1:18:06] preaching there's millions of preachers
[1:18:09] preaching
[1:18:11] simultaneously the world has the
[1:18:14] need to see men and
[1:18:20] women as written Epistles read of all
[1:18:22] men
[1:18:26] because the greatest message that ever
[1:18:27] was
[1:18:28] preached is not of
[1:18:32] words this message is to be
[1:18:37] living with your own life
[1:18:41] brother preach to the people with your
[1:18:43] own life
[1:18:45] brother brother
[1:18:48] scavi what can I
[1:18:50] do my husband shames me
[1:18:54] my my husband
[1:18:56] despises and he puts me down what must I
[1:19:01] do just be a
[1:19:03] Christian
[1:19:05] brotheri nobody wants to talk to me
[1:19:08] nobody wants to help
[1:19:10] me nobody gives me an opportunity what
[1:19:13] must I
[1:19:15] do just be a
[1:19:17] Christian brother
[1:19:20] scaros I am the most despised
[1:19:23] what must I
[1:19:24] do just be a
[1:19:27] Christian but we can't be a
[1:19:31] Christian if Christ is not in
[1:19:35] us the only way that I can be a
[1:19:39] Christian is that Christ lives in
[1:19:43] me I'm not a Christian by going to
[1:19:46] church I'm not a Christian by being a
[1:19:48] good
[1:19:51] Deacon I'm not a Christian by being a
[1:19:55] preacher I'm not even a Christian by
[1:19:57] being a
[1:19:59] pastor we can only be Christian is if
[1:20:02] the Life of Christ Living in us and if
[1:20:04] Christ is in
[1:20:05] us then we no longer
[1:20:08] live and now Christ lives in
[1:20:11] us and if the Life of Christ is in
[1:20:14] us how are we going to
[1:20:18] act exactly the way that Christ beh and
[1:20:21] who was Christ
[1:20:23] a man of
[1:20:25] love if there was somebody that knew how
[1:20:27] for it was Christ
[1:20:31] father forgive
[1:20:33] them for they know not what they
[1:20:36] do that was
[1:20:38] Christ he was pure
[1:20:40] love he was Mercy walking
[1:20:43] around the
[1:20:46] Forgiveness the restoration walking
[1:20:49] around if Christ's life is not in me
[1:20:54] then I'm a deceiver when I say that I'm
[1:20:55] a
[1:20:57] Christian oh precious
[1:21:00] Brothers to be like
[1:21:02] Christ in this
[1:21:04] life is what I long to
[1:21:08] be how many times have not
[1:21:12] that that hym should not only be a
[1:21:16] song it should be a way of
[1:21:20] life amen thank you Lord
[1:21:28] one day a well-known man of the
[1:21:34] Bible he asked me to define the word
[1:21:39] Christian and I thought to myself that's
[1:21:44] easy Christian is a a follower of
[1:21:47] Christ this
[1:21:50] doctor he smiled and he said
[1:21:55] no Christian means
[1:22:00] Christ and I saw that it was that
[1:22:04] way when I say that I am a
[1:22:08] Christian I am saying that I am
[1:22:13] Christ and in the only way that I could
[1:22:15] be
[1:22:17] Christ is for Christ to be in
[1:22:21] me
[1:22:24] in the month of October in the year of
[1:22:28] 2003 I was in a service and I was a
[1:22:33] deacon and all of a sudden the Holy
[1:22:35] Spirit began to fall
[1:22:39] down and at that time I had already been
[1:22:42] in the church for about 25
[1:22:45] years and never in my life did I ever
[1:22:47] experience something so
[1:22:50] powerful all of a sudden the preacher
[1:22:52] had said
[1:22:57] I am sick and tired of looking in the
[1:22:58] mirror and looking at
[1:23:02] myself I am tired of speaking and
[1:23:04] hearing my own
[1:23:07] voice I don't want to look like my
[1:23:10] father I don't want to look like brother
[1:23:12] Bernie
[1:23:14] Garcia and when I heard that I I I was
[1:23:19] shocked and I said to myself will I want
[1:23:21] to be like ber Garcia
[1:23:23] will and all of a sudden he said I don't
[1:23:25] want to be like William
[1:23:27] brandham and once again I I fell
[1:23:31] back but I thought to myself I want to
[1:23:33] be like William
[1:23:35] BR he said I want to look like
[1:23:39] Christ I want to be
[1:23:44] Christ and that should be our
[1:23:48] need and that should be our
[1:23:51] desperation
[1:23:53] the holy
[1:23:57] spirit is more important than the air we
[1:24:00] breathe the holy
[1:24:04] spirit is more important than life
[1:24:08] itself without the Holy Spirit then we
[1:24:11] have
[1:24:13] failed without the Holy Spirit we have
[1:24:15] lost this
[1:24:18] battle without the Holy Spirit then
[1:24:20] we're completely lost
[1:24:23] without the Holy Spirit we know nothing
[1:24:25] about
[1:24:26] love without the Holy Spirit we know
[1:24:28] nothing about
[1:24:30] forgiveness without the Holy Spirit we
[1:24:32] don't know nothing about what Mery
[1:24:35] is without the Holy Spirit we don't know
[1:24:37] what Grace
[1:24:39] is and a man once told me over 20 years
[1:24:42] ago that the world is
[1:24:45] dying just for an ounce of
[1:24:48] love where is the
[1:24:50] love sitting in the
[1:24:53] churches where is
[1:24:56] love the love should be in
[1:24:59] me the love should be in all of
[1:25:03] you love should be in each and every
[1:25:05] daughter and
[1:25:07] son it should be in all the
[1:25:11] preachers and the love should be in the
[1:25:15] ministry the love should be protecting
[1:25:17] the
[1:25:18] door the love should be cleaning the
[1:25:21] church
[1:25:23] and love should be
[1:25:25] directing and love should be present in
[1:25:28] all things if we have not
[1:25:31] love then we're just
[1:25:33] hate it's either hate or
[1:25:37] love beloved
[1:25:42] [Music]
[1:25:45] Brothers the day that we have been
[1:25:46] preaching for so
[1:25:48] long is now at
[1:25:51] hand
[1:25:55] and just as how we were surprised with
[1:25:56] this
[1:25:58] pandemic that's how many people are
[1:26:00] going to be
[1:26:03] surprised after that change happens and
[1:26:05] people will continue to go to church but
[1:26:08] God will no longer be
[1:26:10] there it's time to see our own
[1:26:15] selves it's time to check up on
[1:26:20] ourselves and it's time to check up on
[1:26:22] our own personal
[1:26:25] experience and it's time to ask
[1:26:27] ourselves how are we with God I had
[1:26:30] asked a brother
[1:26:32] once how are you with god
[1:26:35] brother how is it with you and
[1:26:38] God and this Minister brother began to
[1:26:42] cry all of us must ask
[1:26:44] ourselves how are we with
[1:26:47] God it doesn't matter if we're
[1:26:50] preachers it doesn't matter if we're
[1:26:51] ministers
[1:26:53] it doesn't matter if we're the children
[1:26:55] of the P it doesn't matter if we're the
[1:26:57] wife of the
[1:26:58] pastor it doesn't matter if we're the
[1:27:00] parents of the pastor it does not
[1:27:04] matter we all must check up on ourselves
[1:27:07] to see how we're with God and I ask
[1:27:09] myself every instant in life how am I
[1:27:12] doing with
[1:27:13] God and I can't be right with
[1:27:16] God if I'm not okay with my
[1:27:20] brother I can't be right with my brother
[1:27:23] if I'm not okay with
[1:27:25] my how can I love
[1:27:28] God if I don't love his
[1:27:30] children how can I love
[1:27:33] God if I don't love my
[1:27:35] brother how can I love
[1:27:38] God if I don't forgive my
[1:27:40] brother the only
[1:27:43] way that I can serve
[1:27:46] God Is by serving one of the only
[1:27:50] way that I can love
[1:27:53] God Is by loving his
[1:27:57] children and this is a worldwide
[1:28:00] need there is a great
[1:28:03] pandemic the lack of
[1:28:06] love that is the worst of the
[1:28:09] worst the lack of
[1:28:11] love and the world is
[1:28:14] dying the churches are
[1:28:17] dying the marriages are
[1:28:20] are the children leaving the
[1:28:23] homes because of the lack of
[1:28:27] love and if there's something that we
[1:28:29] must ask for ask God is give me
[1:28:33] love love for your
[1:28:36] word love for my
[1:28:41] neighbor and love for
[1:28:47] myself we were cut off guard by this
[1:28:50] great
[1:28:51] sickness
[1:28:52] and it has taken many people and we've
[1:28:57] cried and we've experienced
[1:29:02] many and it has affected us the absence
[1:29:04] of
[1:29:05] our but what about the P
[1:29:12] the brother brandham says that
[1:29:14] everything that happens in the natural
[1:29:18] happens we didn't want to hang around
[1:29:20] with the one that had Co
[1:29:24] we didn't even want to be five meters
[1:29:25] close to
[1:29:28] him I'm not going to get close because
[1:29:30] then I'm going to get
[1:29:31] infected but there's another
[1:29:34] Co the lack of love there's another
[1:29:38] Co the lack of faith there's
[1:29:42] another the lack of the Holy Spirit
[1:29:45] there's
[1:29:46] another not knowing how to forgive
[1:29:49] there's another
[1:29:50] Co not ask for forgiveness what about
[1:29:55] that it is a
[1:29:58] silent disease that we have no idea when
[1:30:01] it comes
[1:30:04] in the Bible tells us don't be afraid of
[1:30:06] the destroy the
[1:30:09] Flesh and how have we taken care of
[1:30:11] ourselves from this
[1:30:13] Co but what about the spiritual
[1:30:17] Co how many brothers have been left on
[1:30:19] the
[1:30:20] Wayside how many have left the
[1:30:26] way and how many have gone after
[1:30:28] incorrect
[1:30:30] doctr how many children have left
[1:30:33] home how many marriages have been
[1:30:37] destroyed how many ministers don't speak
[1:30:39] to each other what's going
[1:30:41] on
[1:30:43] covid-19
[1:30:45] emergency where are the
[1:30:47] doctors where's the
[1:30:49] medicine where are the hospitals
[1:30:52] people used to say don't take them to
[1:30:55] the hospital you're going to kill
[1:30:57] them how many of you have heard
[1:31:01] that I'm closing
[1:31:04] now when I was a
[1:31:06] kid I didn't know I was a
[1:31:12] preacher but when somebody was next to
[1:31:18] me and people would begin to get
[1:31:20] surprised because
[1:31:24] and when they would tell me take me to
[1:31:25] your church a voice would tell
[1:31:29] me they would tell me don't take
[1:31:32] them you're going to kill
[1:31:37] them and that voice spoke to me until
[1:31:40] years and I never took anybody to
[1:31:45] church I testified I read about the
[1:31:47] message and I read about the Bible and
[1:31:50] when they ever asked me to take them to
[1:31:51] church
[1:31:52] the voice would tell me don't take them
[1:31:56] you're going to kill
[1:31:57] them so then I said to
[1:31:59] myself then I'm the
[1:32:01] devil I'm a son of the
[1:32:04] devil how is it that I'm not supposed to
[1:32:06] take them but then I remember one
[1:32:12] day they had sent two ministers from
[1:32:14] here to
[1:32:17] Peru over 20 years
[1:32:20] ago I remember remember that we got into
[1:32:22] a
[1:32:23] taxi and I got into the back
[1:32:28] seat and then all of a sudden the Holy
[1:32:30] Spirit fell down in the
[1:32:31] taxi and when I saw
[1:32:34] these they were practically
[1:32:38] drunk have you ever seen a drunk
[1:32:40] person that's how they
[1:32:43] were completely
[1:32:46] drunk and the taxi driver was shaking
[1:32:49] and
[1:32:50] crying
[1:32:52] and then all of a sudden once we got to
[1:32:53] the
[1:32:57] place and these two men once they got
[1:32:59] out of the car they went uh stuttering
[1:33:01] to the inside the office and I stayed
[1:33:03] behind with the taxi
[1:33:06] driver and the taxi driver asked me what
[1:33:08] is
[1:33:09] this and I told him this is the Holy
[1:33:12] Spirit and all of a sudden he tells
[1:33:15] me take me to your church
[1:33:18] please and all of a sudden the voice
[1:33:20] never spoke to me again
[1:33:24] so then I made an agreement with him
[1:33:26] that tomorrow I will
[1:33:28] take and then I thought to myself
[1:33:31] finally I'm going to
[1:33:32] take so then I went to the voice of
[1:33:34] restoration office and the brother told
[1:33:39] me and what terms did you finish with
[1:33:41] the
[1:33:43] brother and I told him well tomorrow I'm
[1:33:46] taking him to church he told me
[1:33:49] no don't do it please don't do it why
[1:33:54] not you're going to kill
[1:33:57] them so then what am I supposed to
[1:34:01] do first take him to
[1:34:04] Christ and then you can take him to
[1:34:07] church because if you take them to
[1:34:09] church you're going to kill
[1:34:12] them but first take them to
[1:34:16] Christ and so when they see the problems
[1:34:18] that are in church they're not going to
[1:34:20] move
[1:34:22] because they are
[1:34:25] first so then I remember the words of
[1:34:28] Christ follow me
[1:34:30] Peter and I will show you how to fish
[1:34:33] how do you
[1:34:36] fish some are fish with sticks and
[1:34:41] spe and others are fishing with
[1:34:44] dynamite and some with anchor and
[1:34:47] hook how do you
[1:34:50] fish one day I saw a man take a
[1:34:54] horse and he got up to the tree and he
[1:34:57] broke a branch
[1:34:59] off and all of a sudden I I see him
[1:35:01] taking the leaves
[1:35:03] off and I began to think why is he
[1:35:05] taking the leaves off of that
[1:35:07] BR and all of a sudden I saw him
[1:35:11] Dominate and he put him in
[1:35:14] subjection and in half an hour this
[1:35:17] Fierce
[1:35:18] horse was the most tamed horse of all
[1:35:23] and then later years on I went
[1:35:27] on I saw another Cowboy dominate a
[1:35:31] horse but he wouldn't use any
[1:35:34] Force he would have his uh hands in his
[1:35:38] pocket and I didn't know what was in his
[1:35:41] pockets but then all of a sudden I saw
[1:35:43] that he took out some
[1:35:46] sugar and he would tame the horse with
[1:35:48] the
[1:35:49] sugar it didn't need any for
[1:35:52] for it didn't need any kind of pressure
[1:35:55] only
[1:35:57] sugar what is
[1:35:59] sugar sugar is
[1:36:04] love preaching without is
[1:36:09] just a preaching without love is just
[1:36:12] nothing
[1:36:14] but and the preaching of the word of
[1:36:19] God and the word of God is torment it's
[1:36:21] a
[1:36:23] deliver what is it that jari needs
[1:36:26] sugar
[1:36:28] love who doesn't like
[1:36:31] love everybody needs
[1:36:33] love the homes need
[1:36:36] love the churches need
[1:36:38] love and the pastors
[1:36:40] need the ministry need we all need
[1:36:44] love and the world is uh Dying For
[1:36:48] Love why does a man get drunk isn't it
[1:36:52] because of the lack of
[1:36:53] Love why is it that they go after the
[1:36:55] drugs isn't it because of the lack of
[1:36:57] Love why does a
[1:36:59] man isn't because of the lack of
[1:37:03] love and all the problems are because of
[1:37:05] the lack of love we need
[1:37:08] love each and every
[1:37:11] day and there in the hospital
[1:37:16] dying I learned a new love that I never
[1:37:20] knew
[1:37:22] and I thought that I knew already enough
[1:37:23] about
[1:37:25] love and there when I almost gave up the
[1:37:30] spirit I realized that I knew nothing
[1:37:33] about love I preach about
[1:37:37] love but love is
[1:37:40] unmeasurable we uh preach about
[1:37:43] Grace we know very little about
[1:37:48] Grace because Grace is unmeasurable
[1:37:52] we need
[1:37:54] Grace and we need
[1:37:56] love my name
[1:38:01] is
[1:38:06] Grace and I hope that each and every one
[1:38:08] of us can be called
