more of thee we want to understand you more to please you more so help us tonight lord are you marcos help me and marcos the name of our lord jesus christ amen amen we can turn to exodus chapter 27 verse 1. um wood five cubits long five cubits abroad and the altar shall be four square and the height thereof shall be three cubits and thou shalt make the horns of it upon the four corners thereof his horn shall be of the same and thou shalt overlay it with brass may the lord have the blessings to the reading of his word this evening we're going to continue with the series of the tabernacle this is the altar we're going to speak a little bit about the brass altar like i've mentioned in the past like brother branham says bronze represents brass represents judgment for our sins in other words it has the number five and then the height of three cubits now five and three are numbers that we already know right we know that five is grace great and three is perfection now what represents the measurements of this uh furniture is that it's a furniture of grace the perfection and it's a furniture of perfection though it has judgment in it that's because jesus in the cross at calvary is for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified because in the brass although the offering was given for and with that offered at the cross at calvary jesus perfect jesus has made us perfect through his blood not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to the mercy he saved us by washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost jesus salvador which he shed abundantly through jesus christ our savior that being justified by his grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life so now the cross at calvary through the revelation of the new testament shows us that through the salvation that he made at the cross through the offering he made through his own body takes us to his grace and takes us on to perfection like it says in both scriptures that we just read now another part of that brass altar is that it has horns it has four horns and how many knows before we have to go into it four is an earthly number speaks about the earth and it speaks about deliverance yes and that altar can represent that represents the cross at calvary it has horns it has that cross all those benefits or the benefits that come through the crosstalk if you accept what christ did for you it has the ability to give you deliverance significance now what do horns mean we've got to take the message says in the message the breach between the seven church ages and the seven seals seven horns was the seven churches the seven church ages because that was the lamb's protection the horns of the altar gracia they give you grace perfection perfection liberation deliverance protection and protection he furnished it in a certain way because every furniture un significado in particular it has a particular meaning just like the wife of the house temple in his temple in his tabernacle he has things in a certain manner they have a message within it it's not just there to be there is about perfection about deliverance and about protection of the lamb jesus jesus was the lamb that was laying at the cross and david spake unto the lord the words of this song in the day that the lord had delivered him out of the hand of his enemies and out of the hand of saul so you see what it says here in verse one david liberacion david received deliverance in verse two it says [Music] and he said the lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer refuge the the god of my rock in him will i trust he is my shield and the horn of my salvation my tower and my refuge my savior thou saves me from violence now in in spanish it says you it is the strength of my salvation it gives the lord is my rock in my fortress and my deliverer my god my strength in whom i will trust my buckler and the horn of my salvation and my high tower in espanol and once again in spanish it says the strength of my salvation and then in english the horn of my salvation foreign that's why [Music] blessed be the lord god of israel for he hath visited and redeemed his people and hath raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant david now in verse 69 it speaks of a person it says the powerful savior but in english it says it's the horn of salvation because christ has horns and those horns give us salvation if [Music] thieves at the crosstalk jesus both at the altar were both at the cross with with jesus they're at the altar with him one accepted the other rejected both to he was justified so the horns offer protection to the person that desires it it offers deliverance to those who can accept it it offers grace and perfection if you desire it and now once again in the breach between the seven church ages and the seven seals paragraph 224 significa horn means power to the animal experience and the message experiences preached in 1947 branham a horn of healing to the people now because of the offering christ did at the cross brother branham also teaches us jesus jesus to die at the cross it also gives you if you accept it and the brother ramses in the message who do you say this is he had to be born in march or april for he was the lamb and he was uh the male sheep and born under the ram aries yes jesus had to be born in the month of april now the zodiac sign for that month is aries it's aries el carnero the ram carnero now the realm it has horns now christ is our realm if you remember abraham and isaac but god told abraham to offer isaac as a sacrifice they went up the mountain and he already took the wood isaac already had the wood eva and he was ascending the mountain to be killed himself just like christ had to ascend with his own cross to calvary he went there abraham was going to slay him remember that altar is an altar of decisions it's such a determining decision that you're going to continue forward and abraham had determined he was going to kill isis though it hurt his soul that's a decision god sees that it hurts you so much it's killing you so much to leave behind the things you enjoy of the world but because of that sincere decision you're making that you determined to i am crucified along with christ is just like jesus made the decision in gethsemane that he would go so it hurt him so much to make that decision he decided to go that's so abraham decided he'd kill his own son the one that he waited for for 25 years and then he was going to kill him that's a decision you have to make and it's going to hurt the more you're in the world and when god finally calls you it's going to hurt you to leave all that [Music] it has protection and deliverance gracia grace perfection perfection and healing it's a place of refuge you remember the woman that was caught in the act of adultery jesus the bible says that the men they dragged her to jesus and those men wanted jesus to apply the law meaning that she committed adultery the law said she needed to be stoned but also within the law there was a little bit of grace so in the old testament if someone killed someone else is and in some way it wasn't intentional it was not the intention to kill that person but i want to see my persona but nonetheless they killed the person god could also see that in and if that man decides that your case is [Music] [Music] from the people that are in search of killing now if a person couldn't reach the city of refuge because it was too far um because there were six cities if you couldn't reach any one of those cities and you can grab hold of the horns at the altar if the city was too far and you'll receive the same benefits of protection like as if you were in the city of refuge brother branham says horn represents a kingdom entonces protection now brother branham says in the message letting off the pressure now the people could come to this city of refuge if accidentally he done something wrong he didn't mean to do it he would go to the city of refuge and go to the gates the gatekeeper would ask him why he's coming qualia what was his idea of coming then his case was pleated and when his case was pleated in la puerta at the gates and as a place of refuge then the enemy could not get him and if he lied and done wrong come into the city of refuge [Music] to drag him from the altar and kill him because you've got to be sincere when you come to the altar when you come to christ you come to the city of refuge to drag him from the altar and kill him yes sir because he was guilty premeditated and he had to be punished now if he meant to do it well he had to stand to the circumstances but there's no chance for him if he did it willfully remember you've also got to come to the altar and die it's an altar it's an altar of decisions that sees your decision and he's the one that determines if you were sincere that determines if he accepts your your repentance or not saying brother and there's two classes of people today may i say this there's men and women in the world today is there's men and women in this world today that don't want to sin i feel sorry for them [Music] an example of that is in first kings chapter one verse one the bible says now when king david was stricken in years they covered him with clothes but he got no heat verse 5 says exalted himself saying i will be king and he prepared him chariots and horsemen and fifty men to run before him and his father had not displeased him at any time and saying why hast thou done so and he also was a very godly man and his mother bear him after absalom and here conferred with joab the son of zariah and with abbathar the priest and they following adenija help the son of jehoda jehoiada jehoiada and nathan the prophet and shemi and rai and the mighty men which belonged to david were not without nigeria animals and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of zahaleth which by anne rigel and called his brethren the king's sons and all the men of judah the king's servants but nathan the prophet and banaya and the mighty men and solomon his brother he called not so now here's a man he self-proclaimed himself as king he started to do things that were allowed because he was a king he started to have feasts he started feared because of solomon and arose and went and cut hold of the horns of the altar is and it was told solomon saying behold adenija feared king solomon for lo he hath caught hold of the horns of the altar saying let king solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword beneficious solomon sent was holding on to the horns of the altar he could not touch him our if he will show himself a worthy man there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth but if wickedness shall be found in him he shall die remember it's a sincere decision you'd make alveneer al-altar so king solomon sent and they brought him down from the altar and he came and bowed himself to king solomon and solomon said unto him go to thine house before he let go of the horns he he says that this will be the night that you'll reward and pour down your holy spirit upon this convention and there may not be and it may not be uh this is frolic obrin or jumping around but a weeping and the crying and repenting holding onto the horns of the altar while we see judgments rolling beneath us tonight i pray sincerely as i know how in the name of jesus christ all pentecostal pentecost run for your life flee to the horns of the altar and cry out before it's too late for an hour will come where you can cry and it'll do you no good that altar experience where people are jumping and they're happy that comes afterwards but first comes the bra where you have to sincerely repent yes i will fail it's something ugly muy fail very now in the tabernacle estan los atrios there are the outer courts and then the holy place and the holiest of holy amen amen and we could say that the holiest of holi estade cortina is behind this curtain here our lemano brand is it's not the outer courts but it's in the holy place and it's a gold altar noise it's not a brass is the oro it's of gold yes and this altar and another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden sensor and there was given unto him much incense that he should offer it with prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne of delance um and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the saints ascended up before god out of the angel's hand represents now incense represents prayer it's justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost we already know this is god also shows these three stages through the three different places of the temple los atrios the outer courts the holy place and then the holiest of holi yes and that uh of protection you can find them through prayers if you can only be sincere you've when you're before the altar aura now zechariah el padre de juana batista the father of john the baptist he was there at the temple gabriel when the archangel gabriel appeared to him and the bible says in luke 1. the angel appeared on the right side of the altar of incense of the altar of incense i don't have the quote but brother branham says that angel queben esconel that would come to the meetings with him what happened to brother branham it happened in zechariah just right at the altar of incense in offering prayer the angel was right there now that gold altar represents sanctification it represents sanctification now the message god has a provided way in 1954. brother brown says the brass speaks of divine judgment on the brazen altar where the beast's bodies were burned three o'clock in the afternoon every jew in palestine fell to his feet and his hands towards heaven and as the smoke ascended his prayers went with it now this was with the brass altar where all the people could see the smoke and when they saw smoke they'd offer their prayers where there was a incense altar where they would offer that that smoke yes eso represented verse 36. and thou shalt offer every day of bullock for a sin offering and thou shalt cleanse the altar when thou has made an atonement for it and thou shalt anoint it to sanctify it foreign seven days shall thou make an atonement for the altar and sanctify it and it shall be an altar most holy whatsoever touches the altar shall be holy is now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar two lambs of the first year day by day continually and the other lamb thou shalt offer at the evening juan bautista presented john the baptist presented the sacrifice in the morning and there's the evening sacrifice john the baptist william branham and william branham i'm going to show it to you here's elijah i believe before the 400 prophets false prophets the false prophets so ahab sent unto all the children of israel and gather the prophets together unto mount carmel remember what i told you about the alternate the altar disalter is also an altar of decision ye between two opinions if the lord be god follow him if baal then follow him and the people answered him not a word to the people i even only remain a prophet of the lord but baal's prophet are 450 men yes let them therefore give us two bullocks and let them choose one bullock for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood and put no fire under and i will dress the other bullock and lay it on the wood and put no fire under it and call you the name of your gods and i will call in the name of the lord and the god that answered by fire let him be god and all the people answered and said it is well spoken entonces they'd burn it and who is the real god and he's with this prophet he says verse 26 and they took the bullock that was given them and they dressed [Music] is and cut themselves after the manor with knives and lancets till the blood gushed out upon them and the midday passed and they still kept crying out hasta laura in sacrificial until the time of offering the evening sacrifice in english and i really love how it says in english until offering of the evening sacrifice this specifically happened when elijah was going to offer his sacrifice it was in the evening time not in the morning juan bautista john and john the baptist had his day pero in the evening time there was neither voice nor any to answer no any that regarded entonces and elijah said unto all the people [Music] come near unto me and all the people came near to him and he repaired the altar of the lord that was broken down elias estaba restaurant elijah was restoring branham what did brother branham come forth is and elijah took 12 stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob upon whom the lord upon whom the word of the lord came saying israel shall be thy name in the number and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the lord and he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed and he put the wood in order and cut the bullock in pieces and laid them upon the wood cuatro canton and he said fill four barrels of water and pour it upon the bird's sacrifice and upon the woods and he said do it a second time and they did it the second time and the water ran about the altar and filled the trench also with water is of the temple because the fountain and the brass altar esta los atrios they're in the outer courts and those outer courts represent justification that's why we should repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ elias elijah justification shows us justification through repentance and the baptismal water sacrifice and elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of abraham isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou art the god and israel in israel and that i am thy servant and that i have done all these things at thy word respond hear me oh lord respond to me hear me and that thou has turned their hearts and consume the sacrifice the wood las piedras the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench the third part in the holiest and it was god that gave the fire fue elias it was elijah el cualmostro usted who showed how you can get to justification how you can get to that only but your sincerity takes you from one place to the next and finally seeing that you're sincere he accepts you and then he gives you the fire de la tarde he did it in the evening now we live in the evening he gave us the right process to reach the new birth crucification justification sanctification baptism and the baptism of the holy ghost in ezra 9 5 it says and having rent my garment and my mantel i fell upon my knees and i spread out my hands upon the lord my god in psalm 141 lord i cry unto thee make haste unto me give ear into my voice let my prayers set forth before thee as incense friend the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice so what you do see important it matters your sincerity at the brass altar then he gives you the fire of the holy ghost i want to read the last quote and uh this uh the sun has come out it said uh i forgot to read it okay the rising of the sun yeah it is the rising of the sun and she was as you know about half indian algorithm but in there she was a person that didn't dream but i don't think she only had four or five dreams all of her life every time she dreamed a dream it was true enya alguna just above here and i was preaching right here at this church and she dreamed a dream that i was standing here by the side of these three steps and i was standing preaching to everybody that they must walk up these three steps and on the highway is a little pearly-like white line that would run right into the doors of heaven and that pearl had been stretched out to the top of these three steps yes yes and if that ain't my message exactly today justification justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost is and i was saying that a person has to come by these three steps to be able to walk to that highway sustainable sincerity because there's many people that get to the brass altitude and for us but not enough to leave something behind la since necessary sincerity is so necessary [Music] heavenly father tonight [Music]
