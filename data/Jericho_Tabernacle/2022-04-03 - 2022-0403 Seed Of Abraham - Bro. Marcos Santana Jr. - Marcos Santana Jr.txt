ramiro's prayers and uh it took me back to what our brother my brother was speaking on friday when i was interpreting for him up here he started speaking about what a blessing jericho has been for us and how privileged we are to be here and what god has done with these people and he started talking about the love that we have for one another and and being that i was interpreting him [Music] [Music] for all my brothers and sisters as a family here because we're a great family he said grand family said lord i ask that you can keep us all united i feel like that was perfectly what our pastor was telling us on friday love that we should have for one another and we pray that god fills us with more of his love this morning uh as i have you standing [Music] uh we're gonna be turning our scriptures to genesis chapter 22. we're going to be reading verse 17. and then from there we'll be turning to galatians chapter 3. i want to thank the pastor in the ministry for the opportunity to be here again [Music] and thank all of the musicians and everyone that participated in the service and to thank each and every one of you for bringing your part of the revival this morning is and let us not forget to keep our pastor in prayer as he returns back from mexico today along with those brothers that accompany genesis 22 17 reads genesis that in blessings i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies galatians 3 16. now to abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ god bless you brother ricardo okay i just i just saw you that's really good to see you brother ricardo we thank you lord jesus for another day of life you grant us jesus and hear a little more of your word to hear those supernatural confirmations that you give us confirmations keep that revival ever stirring inside of us and lord may we continue to love one another without agape love we put this service in your hands i put myself in your hands no main amen amen you may be seated brothers uh if i can give a little title to this small talk this morning i'd like to title it seed of abraham the seed of abraham and as we just read in genesis the blessing that god said was going to be upon abraham and then with a little more revelation in the book of galatians uh we hear here how the seed was not a seed as in many like it says and if you'd like to turn in first corinthians chapter 12. or you can just read it there on the screen uh just to give a little more light to it that seed that christ that multi-member body that we are is all the members of that one body and then verse 13 says for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body so we're still one body we're still one seed you jump down to verse 27. each and every one of you are an individual piece or an individual member of that body individual so now we understand that it wasn't plural multiple seeds but the bible says a singular seed just one the true seed that seed of the promise of the birthright of the blessings which was isaac the natural seed of abraham was that isaac but it was not the real seed or the royal seed and today we have many seeds out in the world especially in the christian or the religious realm especially those seeds begotten those begotten pentecostals but christians like what we have here this morning abraham and brother branham says it is that the isaac was just as substitutionary till christ came because jesus christ was the royal seat of abraham so now when god makes a promise we all know god's going to keep to his promises he has to make sure that we are worthy of that blessing well if abraham the father of faith had to be tried and we've got that dna in us and we've got those faith genes in us these trials or these tests in part these are for for others to see espera like that blind man when they were asking why was he blind when no one sinned jesus just wanted to manifest his glory jesus gloria your test your trial supremacy for someone in your family someone in your your community or in the church or to be able to see god's glory operate in your life foreign sometimes it's even deeper than that just like joe asico mohob it's strictly so that satan can see who you are didn't deserve of none of the things that happened to him but yet god gave him the green light to attack him yes job was going to grow in the face yes there was going to be family and friends that were going to see god's glory family amigos satan was going to see that job could do it all on his own because we always look at the story of job like god that just always blessed him with belongings but i like to look at it a little different different we're in job's tests and trials throughout his life god his complaints to god imparted not just saying you bless him with all these belongings and riches but every test and trial that you put him through but why don't you let me take a shot at him and leave him alone let's see if he can really still serve you so god took all and if we can just give praise to god hospital and she recently got released and in that text that he shared with everyone he was giving praise to god she wasn't healed at the hospital in the hospital she was healed that day on calvary he's not going to be healed at home because she was already healed that day on calvary but we recognize the tests are going to come recon and after the test is going to come the blessing that's why i like to identify with rebecca identification you know her test might not seem like too much he says but what if somebody came to you from africa with this message and he's a dark-skinned brother who we've never seen before i've so we're talking to a bunch of lunatics this morning and it's a test yes like the first step in anything ever almost everything you do in life requires faith the act to go to sleep requires faith to know you're going to wake up in the morning the act of walking to your car requires faith that is going to turn on i was rereading the story i believe it was her brothers or her uncles i'm not too sure that we're saying and please can you leave us with her for about 10 more days that this is what shall receive the gift of the holy ghost so to all the rebecca's here la la revenant what are you god has a really strange pattern of the way he does things it's very unique but at the same time it's perfect it's something that's just holy it's santo you know we can't pinpoint just so we think we've got it figured out it's in some kind of way that we least imagine you know like my dad always says he had a million different ways figured out how i would come to the feet of jesus never would he would have thought that i came the way that i came in never would have thought that my girlfriend would be the genuine believer and i'd be the hypocrite because we can't figure out god the perfect plan and we've just got to accept it and that's the same way it is with the tests he puts on our lives it's not for our punishment it wasn't for the punishment of job the punishment the tests weren't for the punishment of abraham but it was for an edification and a maturity if you look at joseph in the bible he was a special child nino special he was a blessed child we could say i don't even know how to say in english he was spoiled by his uh uh in english he was bored by his father a special place in his heart for that joseph yet he was hated by his brothers sold out into slavery he was it was like he couldn't get a break in life just kept falling down this never-ending pit of problems but every single one of those tests was for a purpose because there was a blessing to come from those tests because joseph too was a seed of abraham and god follows the same pattern patron the blessing was going to be uh that one day he was going to interpret some very important dreams one day he was going to be promoted to the highest in egypt one day he would save his family and his brothers one day he would be given the land of goshen for an entire nation where his family could live and be at peace in the message the oddball appreciate 1964. brother branham says the following and to come and to come here this morning and look this little fine this fine little jerusalem setting out here audience and was referring to how they had come and it was like a goshen where they were at benidorm says remember goshen was one of the places that they worshipped one of the first places that the tent was pitched and to me old friends and the new and to have all this time allotted to us it just seems like that that you just don't want to leave but brother branham here is comparing aqui element like being in goshen to being in church you read it clearly how he's saying it's like a tent that's pitched meet all the new friends like we've met here in church so the land of goshen was like a physical church today and a place of security for for themselves like brother brown says a place where they can worship this but the believer today in the midst of the egypt and the world that we live in today and we've been blessed like we heard friday if we have our own jericho tabernacles but the physical church it has its place and it's respect in the world and it also has its limitations you know if you think of the the physical church any church just like physical iglesia you know it's it's somewhat of a safe place it's a place that's respected from believers non-believers almost anybody respects the church when they see it on the streets incredible you know maybe we could say 99 times out of 100. you're safer in church than being at a sports game made its way into our church you didn't wait at the door in the puerto rico it wasn't standing there on the on the street there on rosier it came in and struck many of us and even killed some of us you know in goshen the israelites they were protected from the plagues like we saw in the children's play that we had you know when when when the frogs came upon the land when the darkness made its way upon egypt there was light in goshen there was a safe place in goshen avion lugar that death angel was going to travel in egypt and it was also going to make its way into goshens that's why goshen and the church are like cutting hair when i talk to people over and over people are so comfortable and quick and easy to say well i go to church oh i'm good oh you see they've got a more security in their face than we do how many times have you been in service quantas basis the minister says how many have the holy ghost right but they have such a conviction that from going to church they're safe i pay my tithes i go to church i'm saved i'm one of the ushers and i seat the people i'm saying i play an instrument i go to church i'm saved i'm a minister at jericho tabernacle i'm saved it doesn't i've been born and raised in goshen or born and raised in the church so i'm saved praying in goshen and fellowshipping in goshen and living in goshen is not going to save you horrando it wasn't going to save the israelites gonna save us going because the church and the tokens been placed on it nothing can breach that boxcar break that seal it's sealed all the way to its destination cannot church is a blessing jericho tabernacle is a blessing to the believers watching online your church is a blessing but that is not the promised land like we said we heard how much of a blessing this church is for us on friday but it's just the church it's not the holy spirit it is not the token we more than anyone should know there's more work to be done we need to be born again you know brother branham says moses needed pallbearers so god provided angels says enoch needed a ladder this is so god provided him with the jawbone so god provided you jesus christ the ultimate sacrifice needed power ocupaba el poder so god provided the holy ghost you know after the days of elijah despues and the days of the prophets and those miracles and wonders and great things that would happen you know the church hadn't seen miracles for many many years and you know if we're not careful and god terries you know those that lived with brother branham are dead those that were children and were at brother brown's meetings they're dead lost those that were under the ministries of those that were children are starting to die and pretty soon we're going to die [Music] it was too much life for them i could think jesus i think of jesus walking around jesus you know what's wrong with these people aren't these not the believers isn't this the church of god that they claim to be keno esto but even then it was too much life for them for them there was too much revelation in the times of a brother we are the and the church they accepted those gifts they embraced those gifts they knew that it came down from god but they made a mistake they idolized those gifts they made those gifts bigger than the gift giver asian quesos they accepted the gifts but they rejected the gift giver bro they why do we let satan continue to push us around in our lives every little thing that happens he's always belittling us you know it's like every moment he gets he just says boo and we jump we better accept the protection that he's given us in his words i've read this scripture who knows how many to have a millstone hanged around his to me that is to think someone has enough power to say that kind of a statement exists legions begged for mercy at the feet of jesus but we've got to be sure that jesus is actually on your side because jesus is only here to protect his seed like we read in genesis como limos in genesis then we read in galatians and then we read in corinthians christ's seed he's only here to protect his seeds the bible says that jesus came to the world not to condemn the world but to save the world so i i i can see there that there was an equal opportunity for everybody but i thought you came to save the whole world i did easy but all you had to do was accept me he knew those that would accept him because not everyone would accept him only the seed of abraham was going to be the one to accept it maybe there's people here this morning they might be mumbling under their breath there might be saying in their mind or their heart i know jesus jesus i accepted him well so did that man in the bible on that day of judgment when he said i know you lord pandodijo senor yo no i did this in your name lord senor simon i did that in your name no maybe you think oh that's not me you that sounds like a minister or a pastor or something like that you know that that's scripture it hits me so hard so when i read that scripture it's like a reality check for me no imagine it's imagining to be there that day oh yes lord i know you see senor yote conosco i preached a jericho tabernacle in your name i cast out demons in your name we prayed for the sick in your name for the lord to say depart from me i never knew you dig you're not royal sea real we've got to be sure we've got to have a real experience oh that we have the lord jesus christ living in our hearts know that we are that seed of abraham if you think about the philistines i don't think any single one of them were even the slightest bit scared no questions they walked tall and walked proud with all of their their their weapons and everything they were fearless just seek goliath on the enemy but how much more should we stand tall how much more should we be fearless we've got jesus christ on our side that big old giant with all those muscles was killed by a tiny little stone the jesus christ that we serve and love el jesus christ he overcame death he didn't need that stature of those muscles bible says there was no beauty in him you put your mirror up right now why have you lost the battles why have you been defeated is it a lack of spiritual training spiritual lack of spiritual food in your life is it that you have a laziness of getting in your words because you have a lazy prayer life i'm not talking to anyone in particular i'm talking to myself in particular that's why i said put up your own mirror and ask your own questions maybe there's someone in here right now kisas you haven't been precocious and you let sin enter into your marriage you've allowed your wife to start doing these things allowed your husband to start doing these things allowed your children to start doing these things you in the privacy of your bedroom your cars your jobs your homes have allowed sin to enter into your own heart and then we ask ourselves why am i defeated and why to say you know it's okay man i've got this one you mean just stay back i'll take care of it but then sometimes god's going to fight with you he's going to say okay because you're going to have to fight all alone solo the bible says be still know that i am god be still son i'm going to fight for you just stay there and resist the devil i'll go take care of it in the background oh but then there are times like shadrach meshach and abednego where they so they were sent to the furnace to die but god stepped on the scene don't worry son you're not doing this alone we're going to fight this one out together we're going to show them who the living god is together but then you have jacob you know i i'm so fond of job in the bible ultimate who was all alone who was scared yes he was desperate yesterday with no one else around him he didn't have any help he didn't have anyone to back him up but there he was when he saw that angel bro and he had to fight all alone he wasn't given any supernatural powers to win this is one of those battles like brother branham says matthias de la cual mentioned a bride night prayer service pray until the morning till you receive that holy ghost all night long until he got his blessings but he fought it all alone and i want to encourage you to every one of you says one that's what he's talking about a seat of abraham established the bride of jesus christ we should be full of joy and confidence then knowing who we are what is that power and authority that backs us up then can you imagine the power and authority that a church of the living god could have already said if it was full of christians that were living right full of christians that were all prayed up yeah you know i think then is when the scripture could be fulfilled if god before us then who can be against us we're going to be closing soon i was reading on elijah yeah and and and there was an occasion where there was a servant who was a little a little nervous a little scared and elijah pulled him aside you know maybe he was scared from a battle battalion and start praying like elijah praying lord can you open the eyes of my brother can you open the eyes of my sister let them see what they have behind them say that be with us or more than [Applause] we're going to be closing the terminal i have just three more quotes maybe a bit of a turn of the corner in the message christ is identified in the same in all generations thank you brothers for putting up top nero it says and please follow along for precedence and now the revival fires are quieting down the enthusiasm in the people is dying off enthusiasm and you can see it brother and that caused the people to go home a couple of days ago sister sarah sent a picture and a message to the ladies chat i'll uh and my wife couldn't be here this morning my children are sick and a lot of times when the message is short in that chat she's able to put it in the translator and and understand what it is when it's in spanish this occasion it was a little long so i was her translator what is this oh it was a picture of brother johnny here brothers is right behind them and i started thinking wow it's been three years so i had to go back in the calendar and yes it fell on that exact date three years ago and therefore that's why this quote stood out so much to me it says and we'll read it again usually a revival lasts about three years and now the revival fires are quieting down the enthusiasm of the people is dying off enthusiasm i think the most impactful part in this impact and you can see it the message possessing the enemy's gates puerto rico and explaining about moses after he had brought the people out of egypt and how they had just crossed the red sea and now they were on dry land on the other side all right brother branham says it is only a few years later when the trials come as it is so easy for a congregation of people to do when something just don't seem to happen the way it's supposed to be a certain person got put into office for this position a certain sister said this on one occasion and the church god shook up foreign it happened forgive me because it didn't it seemed to happen the way that it's supposed to be the church being shook up what brother branham says god makes it that way not the enemy not your brother not your sister god made it that way god brings tensions into the church tension you know what tension is extension it's like when you're walking on eggshells and everythi it's it's like a glass is about to break in the room and brother branham says edison amanda branham every son that cometh to god must be tried who can a son of god tried and proven and tested he lets sickness strike you he lets disease come upon you we spoke earlier about goshen yeah and the church and how it has its limits kovid came in here and killed many of us we are still people that are living survivors of covet right to show but to show the entire world what was the title that you are truly a seed of abraham he permits it because that's his will god's will disease you los amigos for brother r but to one day stab me in the back for one day brother to speak bad about me behind my back to to sell me my friend to turn against me let us keep reading but branham says he permits all those things and here i feel like it gets even more worse he says he turns the devil loose diablo i could think like a dog you just let him go he says to tempt you if you struggled with drugs he's not going to tempt you with drugs he used to struggle with women he don't care about tempting you with women with those things of the past you you just you just came out of egypt no they said no no you are seat of abraham you you you he's going to tempt you in a different way i i don't like how that brother preaches last time he said this this and this is yesterday you know what next time i'm just gonna watch service from the house you know what i got a better job uh i'm just gonna sacrifice fridays or wednesdays i'll watch it one day late la voyage but you're no longer in that security in goshen brother brahm says and he'll do all but take your life he could i can identify a hundred percent with what brother branham says here i the church against you que la iglesias contra can you imagine the seed of abraham la cemente de bram and the church turn against you brother branham says this is anything because it's god's will for him to do it please stan musicians forgive that it is more than more precious than gold to us all these things all these tests and trials they are precious gold for our character as christians maybe the butterflies are no longer in your stomach but there's still more work to do on this earth brother brown is sending the message possessing the enemy's gates this is forgive me christ identified is identified the same in all generations but when but we're trying to rebuild these fires again on every hill that we can say i cannot do it no minister canada it takes all of us the revival might be over he says it's going to take all of us brother brown says together our brother prayed it's going to take all of us will continue to bless his people as we await for his comments just because a revival is over doesn't mean the revival inside of you has to be over no significa you know when that man was out searching for the revival on those streets you are the revival you bring that revival every time you come to services you need to minister for a revival that holy but if you how we in the future because we know just like our father abraham had to be tested we thank you for all your goodness lord jesus jesus we give you all the honor and glory glory in the
