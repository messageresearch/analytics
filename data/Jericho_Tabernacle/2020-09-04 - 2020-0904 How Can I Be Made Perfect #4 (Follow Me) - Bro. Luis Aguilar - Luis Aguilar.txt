praise the lord all day if i could possibly criticize you but uh are you tired this evening i'm tired hey yo i'm tired i am jose los toy but i'm asking the lord to renew my strength amen i was talking to brother john the other day sometimes we kind of have like a back pain or a knee pain that's what happens when you enter in the presence of the lord matthews 5 matteo cinco 38 it's our base scripture that we have um this is this will be our fourth message and as a subtitle to zero in what we're going back to speak on you have heard it have been said an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth but i say unto you either ye that ye resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek turn to him the other also no resistance and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have that cloak also and whosoever saw compel thee to go a mile you have heard that it had been said thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate that enemy but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitely use you and persecute you that you may be children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh the sun rise on the evil and on the good and send it to rain on the just and on the unjust park for if you love them which love you what reward have ye not even the public cleanse the same question and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even republicans be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect the lord bless you once again i'd like to thank our pastor as always we're always having that trust he has towards us to stand behind his pulpit the subtitle will be follow me the way i kind of had the guidance for this subtitle last saturday i was leaving work and i was passing i'm going to be honest i was passing his clinic and while i was passing this clinic i passed a 18-wheeler clinic it was a red semi-truck it was a produce truck and once i met that met that checkpoint it said follow me to perfection just help me out understand what you're trying to reveal to me because and we find out that he wants to test what we say and what we believe is true we saw in genesis 22 the first verse in genesis that after all these things and we find out that he wanted to test abraham's heart and the way he wanted the way he tested his heart is when he grabbed his own very own flesh and blood and took him up to the mountain and he wanted to see if he was going to stagger he wanted to see his heart he wanted to see if he was actually going to do it job was tested god allowed him to be tested said he was a perfect upright man he always made offering for his children his own health he wasn't right he wasn't healthy and the scripture tells us that our very own foes and amigos are of our own households your own family members why don't you just stop going to church just stop and curse just stop believing in that prophet just die and curse your god you and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord notice what she was saying from her heart she was speaking from her heart he wasn't like and the moment a trial comes to our life because that because the heart is his dwelling place now if you're looking for a place to dwell looking for a house they're going to test it you're not going to say okay i want that one nobody see the opposite no you're going to look come inside look at the foundation look if it's comfortable look if you see if you can live here that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith being rooted and know the love of christ which passage with passage knowledge and we're going to speak about that a little bit that he may be filled with all the fullness of god samuel 16 7. this is the lord talking to samuel this is first samuel 16-7 but the lord said unto samuel for the lord see it not as man's now now we see that god never chooses us by our outward appearance man chooses us by our outward appearance firstborn el primo genito big heavy sturdy man was always behind isaac always behind him after his cattle this place so if you were to look to set he's following isaac you would choose esau esco but god didn't choose esau god chose jacob and when samuel came on to jesse he said where are your boys and he said well i got plenty of them i got some big heavy set boys it's a bit of a lengthy quote one time god was going to choose a king to take this take saul's place from backsliding and so he told the prophet who up to jesse's sons i chose one con so jesse said oh that's wonderful he goes out brings a great big tall son seven foot tall elba grande and he said now this man will look beautiful with that crown on his head bring him up here so the prophet said we would just pour oil on him but when he went god said i refused him he brought the next they're the only ones that will look right when the crown on their heads and they're the only ones who are straight enough to walk like a king god said i refuse but i'm sure he wouldn't look good as a king he said go bring him up here let him let me see him as soon as little old david with a little sheepskin coat on it a little slingshot in his hands walking along coming that was on the inside of him man looks on the outside god looks on the heart now see that's the reason why he tests us which means feelings because that's his dwelling place he wants us to be 100 sure that we love him rooted and grounded in love and the message this jesus christ the same yesterday and forever jesus christ 1961 in the garden of eden satan chose the part of man satan his head his your faith will make you believe things that your mind knows nothing about suffering you cast down reasoning it goes against all of that because the sixth sense was given to us the children of abraham what abraham said i have it but i can't touch it one day my daddy will come out of the streets one day um you satan can't understand that he took away his children took away his cattle but he restored his cattle he restored his riches that he didn't give him more sons but his sons were up in glory does the lord give and take away he's not an indian girl he doesn't give you the holy ghost and then take it away from you amen amen now he doesn't just save you now and then he would just forget about your 20 years down the road no he gives it to you and you're always going to have it you're always that's why he said blessed be the name of the lord now we can't have the word in our minds we can't have it there no we have to have it in our hearts now this book all right if it's in your mind that's going to be a rule book to you it's going to be a rulebook do this do this experience like abraham did yeah but my lord my lord loves it me my lord loves it it pleases him when i raise up my hands and pleases the lord when i wear my skirts when you get married you're going to understand that you do it to please your wife i can't you want to see where your neighbor's heart is quiet let them talk let them talk are you going to speak from the heart hey man i'm going to stop myself a little bit more very familiar scripture that we've all read and heard and before estonia family [Music] now this young man is the hobbin he had a question in his heart don't you have questions i have a lot of questions this young man had a question in his heart and he said well what can i where can i go to get this answer where do you go even you older people where do you go where do you have a question do you go to your friend to this young man did he go to his buddy he went to his neighbor no he went to the good master so where do you go he this young man went to the world many of the times when our friends and our family comes to us sometimes we give them the wrong advice because we love them so much and it goes with our relatives but when you go to the words the word isn't going to see it it's going to hurt your feelings or not the word [Music] don't you know that we have a pastor it's very quiet in here being called it's very quiet we have a pastor and a prophet is young folk figures in covenants you have a question tells notice how quickly he even gives a time frame even brother branham gives a time frame the moment that you think that the church i'm a rich young ruler i believe every single thing that came out of the prophet's mouth this young man had a question and he said how can i enter into everlasting life jesus says jesus you want to enter into life keep the commandments you want to enter to life keep it guarded keep doing what you're doing good job and he elaborates yell explicit thou shall not murder that shall not commit adultery this young man said well i've kept them evie i've done it i i've been a righteous man now notice what this young man did keep the commandments keep doing but to follow the word by when he was a party in ohio in ohio and he said he went to this restaurant and that restaurant he likes to go to was closed on sundays so he went to this other one [Music] god what is this and he saw a little old withered up old woman sitting there with makeup on makiyaki and it made brother branham sick and he threw the book illogido libro and he said why can't you do the same with her that is my daughter esa is me and you want me to destroy her and brother branham said he went into himself hey this is and he went up to the old woman it says ma'am can i sit here this is woman said i have some company i don't mean it like that sister this is hermana i don't mean like that no no i'm a minister and he says i'm sorry to talk to her and the woman started to open up and he said i know if you say jose because my my dad was a deacon me and my husband were helping charities and he passed away and he said are you that brother branham having these meetings [Music] is just like abraham did he knew exactly who was going to provide himself a ram that day he knew exactly the lord wasn't going to forsake him he knew it an experience sister brother was talking about his wife and they left the grocery store had an encounter with christ by her her projection look at her miranda you can tell that that woman has met god when you're at school him have you been made perfect brothers and sisters hermanos hermanos brothers and sisters it's hard it's difficult brothers and sisters it's hard you're going to make mistake after mistake all things are possible i can't let go of my powerfulness i can't let go of my envy i can't let go of my jealousy let go and let god did you know that jesus loves you you know that jesus loves you he doesn't care what you did he doesn't care who you are no important is what you think you are who you wanna be to him you're just a little lamb it is he knows you can't do it according to thy will conformity to thy world conform it to power just do it lord just do it just help me are you the man i don't want to understand why you do it but just help me jesus loves me jesus brothers and sisters brothers and sisters we don't deserve to be here we don't deserve to be here but he loves you with all of his heart that's why god gave his own heart this is always going to be a rule book to you este oh don't do this don't do that i know you know hey brother brother brother brown this is because if you have it here you're never going to make it but have it in your heart in your heart the netherlands have a revelation he's he [Music] for some reason that faith comes out of you foreign he wants you torn to pieces he doesn't want you puffed up he doesn't want you stuck up he wants you messi desert when he flews he takes away from your family he takes you away from your friends that's the only way that's the only way hello i'm done i'm done can you please stand here that's the only way god can work with us keep telling yourself that jesus loves you jesus you're never going to make it brothers and sisters he wants to see your heart you could be the worst preacher the worst interpreter the worst song leader but you do it with all your heart and that is what god loves he wants the weakest sinner el pecador is the weakest preacher he wants the weakest sinner that's what he wants that's what he wants now let us close our eyes you feel that the lord has talked to you this evening why don't you just raise up your hands [Music] you don't have to do it if it's not yours do raise up your hand if he's not calling you no levante you raise it up because he's calling you just you're raising up because you're surrendering to him not because you want to fight because you're surrendering to him do you feel like the lord has called you this evening raise up your hands if you want to give your life to jesus christ you can come to the
