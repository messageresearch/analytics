Bible the devil seduces but God makes you fall in love help us Lord to fall in love with you in opening your word we ask all these blessings Lord in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen [Music] amen just as we're standing we're going to go to a scripture in it's in Obadiah 1 uh verse one and it reads the vision of Obadiah thus saith the Lord God concerning Edom we have heard a rumor from the Lord and an ambassador is sent among the Heathen arise ye and let us rise up against her in battle behold I have made thee small among the Heathen Thou Art greatly despised the pride of thine heart hath deceived thee thou that dwellest in the clefts of the Rocks whose habitation is high that saith in his heart who shall bring me down to the [Music] ground though thou exalt thyself as the eagle and thou that set the nest among the stars then will I bring thee down sayeth the Lord if thieves came to thee if robbers by Night how art thou cut off would they would they not have stolen till they had enough if the grape gatherers come to thee they would they not leave some grapes how are the things of Esau searched out how are how are his hidden things sought up all the men of thy Confederacy have brought thee even to the border the men that were at peace with thee haveed deed thee and prevailed against thee they that eat the bread have laid laid a wound under the tree under thee there is none un there is none understanding in him shall I not in that day sayith the Lord even destroy the wise men out of Edom and understanding out of the Mount of Esau okay may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated we also thank the musicians um this morning I'd like to take the theme that I mentioned last week of the flying saucers I'd also like to mention that this week is a very special week for those that know this was the week when brother Brandon preached the Seven Seals he preached it from Sunday to Sunday from March 17th up to today the 24th of March so the 24th which is today he preached questions and answers on the seals and then he preached the seventh SE so what I'd like to do this morning to show how the flying saucers they're connected to the seventh seal now in Revelation 81 and when he opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour brother Bram says in the seventh seal paragraph 77 now the eighth chapter only reveals the scene the scene of the seventh seal where nothing else is revealed now nothing it's not revealed in the seventh seal now has nothing to do with the seventh chapter of Revelation the revelation of the the revealing of the seventh seal is perfectly mute and if I only had time I'll try a few places to show you now as we just heard that brother brandham says the seven seal is silence but there's examples that are in the Bible so it was revealed and it was not revealed it it seems like it's both now paragraph 78 it says all the way back from Genesis this seventh chapter or seventh seal is spoke ofis from the beginning in Genesis how many believe brother brandham okay now in the sardian church age he says and Jesus comes from heaven with tens with 10,000 times 10,000 of his Saints and the Bible says that the heavens was empty for a space of half an hour so where's this big fellow God uhhuh you see he's in Christ so the reason that there's silence first of all God doesn't want anyone to know when he comes but there's also silence in heaven because God comes out of heaven and he comes down to the Earth and the message souls in prisons but remember all this time Noah was in the ark the bride is sealed in with Christ the last member has been redeemed The Sixth Seal has produced itself the seventh seal brings him back to the Earth Earth the lamb come and took the book out of his right hand and sat down and claimed what he owed what he had redeemed that's right it's always been that third pole so we can see why there was silence in heaven God came out of Heaven came down to the Earth when he comes down he comes in a flying saucer I want to emphasize the next quote because as we just read there's an aspect of the seventh seal that is silence but it can also be revealed now brother Brandon says God's only Pro in the message God's only provided place of worship now watch this is a month before he passed away just look at what he says a month prior to passing away now all these things are in there and we find sometime I'd like to come to shreport where we can have two or three weeks just to take 30 minutes a night and just on a teaching see just stay right in the word in these secret passages where we could find out just how to get in so you can see how there's secret passages in the Bible and the seventh seal it reveals how to enter the secret passages of the Bible when God descends he descends with the purpose he comes with the book at his hand to read the names that are there and when God reads the names and descends on the earth he's calling you he's calling you maybe you in your life you're in a denominational system you're in the world so God has a secret passage to call you from there and bring you unto him it's not a public show it's not for the whole world it's a secret passage that God reveals to his seed so as he can find himself with him that's how the Rapture is in a literal aspect but now spiritually the seventh seal it's God coming down to call you for you to go into a secret passage to find yourself with him now say he says in the m in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed God's great mystery of how it is a secret of how it is it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody know nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was opened there was silence Jesus when he was on the earth they wanted to know when he would come he said it's not even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen see God has this all to himself it's a secret and we'll go through the secret passage because the seven seal is not for everyone it's for his elect God revealing himself personally individually so that the individual person can find the secret passage some something that someone else cannot see that's why that's the reason there was silence in heaven for a space of half an hour and seven Thunders utter their voices and John was even forbidden to write it you see the coming of the Lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come and it's a good thing that he doesn't no he hasn't revealed it then he says he has showed or revealed in every type in the Bible that's why the seventh seal has not been revealed because Christ has not come in a physical form but it has been revealed in a spiritual form because Christ already come here Christ has already come not in a physical form he used another body to come every one of us we have different bodies we have an Earthly body a Heavenly Body the Lord also has an Earthly body and a Heavenly Body so the people always wait for the Rapture where God comes down physically but before he comes physically he came down using another body that's why the seven SE was already opened and then it was not opened in one aspect yes but in another no continue saying therefore the entire Bible is the revelation of revelation of God's mystery in Christ the entire Bible is an expression is an expression of one goal that God had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible notice how we when we read previously that even the seventh seal is found in Genesis and then here it says it's found in the entire Bible but it's a secret passage not everyone's going to find but some will be able to find the secret passage of the seventh seal in the entire Bible the entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible and all the acts of the Believers in the Bible has been in the Bible has been an expression of what God's goal is now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it and God's help will'll see it right here in the morning of what he's had this whole time and has expressed it therefore you can see the great meaning of what it's been to know this and then try to bring it to to the people and then you don't I haven't went into details to try and explain it as God has revealed it to me so there's types there's shadows in the entire Bible of the seventh seal the seventh seal it's the coming of the Lord but what way does he come okayy let's go to Revelation 101 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire how many understand that's Jesus Christ not in a physical form but using another body that's the seventh seal but in another form using another body and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth so in verse 1 and2 he speaks about different parts of the body the head the feet the hands those are parts of a body but it's not a physical body it's another type of body so Revelation 81 says there was silence in heaven but the seventh seal is the Lord descending from Heaven unto the Earth so Revelation 81 it shows the seventh seal from the point of view of heaven but then Revelation 10 it shows the seventh seal from the point of view from the Earth so if you want to know about the seventh seal go to Revelation 10 that's the Revelation or it's the flesh the secret passage that the Eagles that have the ability to go up High they'll find secret passages throughout the entire Bible now let's go back to Obadiah 1 remember we're comparing the seven seal to the flying saucers verse one says the vision of Obadiah the Lord thus sayith the Lord concerning Edom Edom is another name for Esau if you go to Genesis 25 when Esau sold his Birthright said his name was Edom we've heard the rumor from the Lord and an ambassador sent among the nation among the heathens uh something that I noticed how says in English we've heard the rumor of the Lord but in Spanish it uses a different word it uses the word uh pron or proclamation of the Lord and that word means an official announcement so it seems like the the languages they contradict one another one is an official announcement and another's a rumor did the Bible make a mistake did the translators make a mistake but a flying saucer it's a rumor it's something that someone else saw and told us about it and I don't know if I should believe him or not but if you search the internet even the government today is officially public uh publicizing videos of flying saucers it's a rumor I don't know but even the government has to accept it they've made public the flying saucers now it says see the Flying Saucer and an ambassador sent among the Heathen the messenger or the Ambassador is the Flying Saucer says God sends flying saucers to different nations to investigate what's happening there so God sends his Ambassador his angel from heaven down to the Earth they're investigating Edom which is today the devil brother BR says that Esau was the seed of the devil so God sends his embassador his Angel his Flying Saucer to investigate What's Happening Here on the earth verse three the pride of thine heart hath deceived thee thou that dwellest in the Cliffs of the Rocks whose habitation is high that saith in his heart who shall bring me down to the ground who does that Spirit remind you of of Lucifer when in heaven he went to the mounts of the congregation to the to theend of the north there I'll make my Throne you that said in your heart it's Edom it's speaking of Edom but truly of the spirit that's within him the spirit of the devil The Serpent of the deil the seed of the devil through his children here on the earth says in verse four though thou exalt thyself as the eagle and thou set th thy Nest amongst the stars then I will bring thee down sayith the Lord now if you see through the entire Bible the devil's always trying to come where God is if God's in heaven the devil wants to get there he did it there in the war with with Michael so when the devil's seed is here on the earth they also want to get to heaven when Kan and abble were here on the earth the fall had already happened the Bible says that men both men they went to the gate that was on the eastern part of Eden there was an angel there a cherubin with a flaming sword and both had to make a sacrifice to enter that Dimension where the Garden of Eden lied but Abel received the seventh seal which is the Lord Lord coming down personally to his seed revealed the secret to Abel of the secret passage of how to enter the Garden of Eden but Cain he was not God's seed but he came so close to enter that Dimension to enter that door God told Cain why are you angry do what your brother did and you'll Enter he didn't want to because the devil and his seed they want to get to heaven in their own way they don't want to accept God's provided way God's provided way the secret passage was revealed to Abel the way that he can have the key to enter into the door was to slay an innocent sacrifice the way they will enter Heaven is through the blood of our sa of our innocent sacrifice which is Jesus Jesus Christ but Cain he rejected what Abel was revealed and he killed his brother he killed the Christ of his day therefore the seventh seal comes brings God down to the Earth we today we're in the seventh Church age and it was in this age that brother brandham says I indict this generation for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ the seventh seal it's revealed in history of Cain and Abel both brothers as they grew they lived through seven Church ages but in the seventh Abel received a visitation let us say a a flying s a cloud on behalf of the Lord and revealed to him the key to enter the secret passage but since Cain is not God's seed he did not reveal it to Cain but even gave him the opportunity without having Revelation to enter all he had to do was do the same as his brother but being that he was the devil's seed and the devil's arrogance he wants to get to heaven his own way he wants to exalt himself Cain in his arrogance rejected God and crucified Abel brother bam says that after the laan church age when the Great you enter the Great tribulation the mark of the best beast begins and then Cain while in the loud Sayan Church age he crucified Abel a judge and then a judge came down from heaven and judged the denominational system of Cain and since Cain rejected Abel who was the Christ the seventh seal revealed on the earth since he rejected and killed him the Bible says that God expelled him and cast him out of Eden and placed a mark on his forehead which represents the mark of the beast because the seventh seal it's in Genesis it's throughout the whole Bible but You' got to find the secret passage how to find the seventh seal inis in Genesis the seventh seal when it's God coming down to the Earth it judges the denominational system that the devil has established through his seed so now we're in the world God already came down in our day the cloud and when the cloud came down brother bradam calls it the judge so there's de the devil's seed in this age and that seed without knowing it's edifying the devil Kingdom edifying the denominational system so therefore they get so close so close to enter Heaven God's giving Mercy tells them you're getting so close but humble yourself and accept my secret passage it's to accept Jesus Christ if you don't accept Jesus Christ you can't enter in and since they don't want to get to heaven God's provided way in their arrogance they reject God and they crucify the seventh seal incarnated here on the earth of their day verse four in Obadiah though thou exalt thyself as e as the eagle and thou set thy Nest Among the Stars Then will I bring thee down sayeth the Lord I heard a minister once he said God doesn't like man to go to the Moon he took the scripture here he spoke about the first spaceship that was able to land on the moono it was called Apollo 11 eagle and it says here if thou would exalt thyself as the eagle and though th set amongst the stars then will I bring thee down sayith the Lord Brother brand says in the message the countdown about the literal astronauts says God's allowing them to do this to show what God will do to his people if there's astronauts that pertain to the devil there's astronauts that pertain to God they'll go in the Rapture with rapturing faith with the anointing of an eagle the devil's imitating the eagle so then when that spaceship went up to the moono it was called Apollo 11 Eagle Apollo and Apollo was a man a name of a Greek god that was worshiped in the past brother brandom says that today's Pope is a modern Apollo so the the president that proposed the idea to send a man to the Moon he was Catholic John F Kennedy John F Kennedy you can find the brother brandham says the Catholic Church entered the United States when they voted for Kennedy now Apollo was a Sun God now it says the spaceship's name was Apollo 11 Eagle so something that really caught my attention the devil's trying to imitate the eagle the name of this spaceship is named is called Apollo the Sun God and we have an eagle we have a ship which which is our son God it's Jesus Christ Phoenix the Phoenix so yesterday I encountered sister Rosman at sister Alma School I started to tell all this to Sister Rosa and she spoke to me of a mural that there that that's at her job if they can show me the pictures these are three drawings or pictures and within these pictures there's a phoenix and there's a spaceship the next image there's the Phoenix the next the spaceship here on the left side the devil wants to imitate the Phoenix he wants to imitate Jesus Christ but to do it his own way let's go to uh Proverbs 16:15 remember man has his own spaceships his own means of transportation which we use while we're here in the Rapture time we won't need that we'll have another means of transportation we want to see if the spaceship is truly in the Bible and Proverbs 16:15 it says in the light of the king's countenance his life and in what magazine was was the cloud published in the light of the king's countenance is is what life and his favor is as a cloud of Latter rainard what is latter rain rapturing Faith okay we're going to show that The Flying Saucer in the Bible in the message events made clear by prophecy brother Bram says friends this is the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 St Luke 17 St John 15 oh so many Revelation 10 so many prophecies that can be pinned exactly to this day and also in the Book of Mark and Matthew where he said these great signs and wonders would appear in the sky and people call them saucers flying saucers they can vanish with the power and quickness of a thought intelligence that can move in he can write can speak can do whatever he wants to the great Pillar of Fire brother br's comparing the great Pillar of Fire to a flying saucer the same yesterday today and forever and coming upon the Earth pyramids of smoke Rising into the air way above where there cannot be no humidity nor nothing 30 miles high what is brother Bram talking about that 30 mil High there's no possibility of any humidity because when this Cloud appeared the dimensions of the cloud was 30 by 26 uh in the air and a cloud consists of water you need humidity to form a cloud now when scientists the devil seed they saw the cloud they couldn't explain how that cloud was there first of all this is Arizona it's dry here it's not a humid climate it's a it's a dry heat it's rare for us to see the clouds not as frequent as in other places it doesn't rain as much here so then a cloud a cloud appearing in a dry place at a certain height it's impossible you need humidity to have a cloud when that cloud is so full of water it starts to rain but a cloud requires water so then when scientists they saw that cloud they couldn't explain how it was there at that height there's no humidity up there it's impossible for the cloud to be there a cloud needs water let me tell you this this Cloud did have a different type of water lad rain that raptured brother brandham why because the cloud it's a flying saucer you've seen in the movies how Flying Saucer comes and it goes up over a person it emits a form of a light a type of a ray that goes to the person and lifts the person when this Cloud came a flying saucer it admitted latter rain that raptured brother brandham because latter rain is rapturing Faith there where there can't be no humidity or anything 30 miles high uh uh a year and half before it happened that it would be that way then turn the picture turn the picture and if you turn the picture you see Christ then turn the picture and see who it is looking down let's go to Obadiah 16 remember the seventh seal is manifested during a specific time the Lord descends to judge and to to Rapture he descends to judge the denominational system the kings of the Earth the kingdom of the devil gradually the devil's building throughout time and if the god seed finds himself trapped in that Kingdom with that denominational system when the seventh seal opens the seventh Dimension where God is God comes down to the Earth and time shall be no more for the denominational system but time shall be no more for God's seed it's because God se's entering into the Eighth Day into eternity a new light greater that makes you see the denominational system it's Darkness one let's start with verse six how are the things of Esau searched out how are the hidden things sought up for the devil to build a kingdom he needs money finances riches as it says now in verse seven the way the devil achieves having those finances you know what the devil's tithes are taxes you say well then I'm not going to pay my taxes anymore Jesus said give to Caesar what is Caesar and to God what is God's so as the devil's charging his tithes charging taxes to edify his kingdom he does it through this various denominations various kingdoms he has here on the earth those denominations those Nations those government governments kingdoms they're they're Confederacy or Allies of the devil verse seven all the men of thy Confederacy have deceived thee that have even brought Thee the men that were at peace that have deceived thee that prevailed against thee they eat thy bread and have laid a wound under thee there is none understanding in him so for the devil to achieve his uh his goal and it says all of thy Confederacy and I enjoy how it says it in English the those of your Confederacy but I also like it in Spanish You're allies because A Confederacy it's a union of various Nations various systems uniting but they will deceive thee let's go to Psalm 831 so before the seven seal takes place the devil's edifying his kingdom having different denominations kingdoms governments that turn into allies of the devil just like the Catholic Church controls everything under heaven so there's a certain pressure that the devil he's applying against God's seed before the seventh seal is manifested that pressure or that persecution the devil's using it to attack God's people but then God descends in the seventh seal to judge the devil in his kingdom and to Rapture his people Psalm 831 we can see the persecution before the seventh seal keep thou keep not thou silence oh God hold not thy peace oh be and be not still oh God for Lo thine enemies make a tumult and they that hate thee have lifted up th the head they have taken crafty counsel against thy people and consulted against thy hidden ones so you can see the persecution before the seventh seal they have said come and let us cut them off from being a nation that the name Israel may be no more in remembrance for consulted together with one consent they are a they are Confederate against thee do you see how this says that they have become a Confederate against thee and an English in Spanish an alliance and an English a Confederate verse six see the different denominations the different kingdoms of the devil the Tabernacles of Edom and the ishmaelites of Moab and the hagaren gabal and Amon and amalec and the Philistines and the inhabitants of Tyreek so then before the seventh seal the devil's building his kingdom through different systems and Nations applying a pressure against God's seed so that they can also Unite with him in that time God comes down in the seventh seal to judge God's kingdom and to rescue the seed and the message the handwriting on the wall everything that Satan has on the earth is something that he's perverted from God God creates and Satan makes an imitation to it there's churches today on Earth great churches that's controlled by the devil it's a perversion from the True Church of God every great denomination is trying to sweep everything into its realm And when they see they failed on that Roman Catholicism had their part but now they're trying to have a confederation of churches and not knowing the Bible said they would have that there would be a beast and an image unto the Beast Confederation of churches and you Full Gospel people know the Assemblies of God Brethren now now look at Esau here how it speaks about Esau Esau was the one that sold his Birthright so God tells in Obadiah he tells Esau the men of their Confederacy are going to deceive thee when you Den when you forfeit your birth rights you when you went into it and that's right you have to deny your Evangelical teachings so the devil's Confederacy to unite to that Alliance you've got to leave Christ just like Cain had the opportunity to accept Christ to accept God's provided way to enter but he rejected the Christ of his day able Cain rejected the EV Evangelical teaching of Abel when Abel killed an innocent lamb Cain he he became a Confederate he became a Confederacy or an alliance with the devil to kill the Christ of his day while Christ was becoming a Confederacy or in an ally entering into a union with Abel when God comes down he unites with his bride but in that time the devil had his own unions to kill the bride the Christ of it's day let's go to Genesis 11 remember the seventh seal is throughout the whole Bible but it's a secret passage revealed to those that have their name in the book if your name's in the book you'll have your own visitation of the seventh seal God will come for you the devil's persecuting through the church let's say your job wherever if you feel the persecution of the devil through the different systems and kingdoms he has established in the world when you're under the persecution God descends in a type and Shadow of the seventh seal to rescue you and gives you a secret passage to escape the pressures of the devilis Genesis 11 uh 111 uh the Tower of Babel and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech look at the unity the Confederacy the alliance of the devil's Kingdom at the Tower of Babel and it came came to pass as they journeyed from the East they found a plane in the land of shinar and they dwelt there and they said one to another go go too let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime had they for Mortar the the scientists of their day and they said go go too let us build a city and a tower whose top May reach unto heaven and let us make a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth remember the devil and his seed they want to get to heaven but their own way Nimrod was making his own way he was imitating Enoch that built a building and saw how Enoch one day disappeared he saw how Enoch probably went through a dimension a secret passage and disappeared Enoch escaped God's judgment that was through through the flood now Nimrod is trying to imitate Enoch a spiritual astronauts and him being a natural astronaut having an alliance in a Unity with different people of the world charging tithes his taxes to have enough money to build a tower that reaches heaven now let's see the seventh seal in verse 5 and the Lord came down to see the city where did the Lord descend from from up there the seventh seal is the Lord coming from Heaven to the Earth so maybe when he descended he descended in an Flying Saucer and Nimrod saw this strange thing and he didn't understand what this light was what that round thing was then he noticed that all that were around him they started to speak Spanish they started to speak Chinese fren German the seventh seal for nimrod was judgment for his kingdom but for Abraham he also lived there and when the seventh seal was manifested it took out Abraham from the devil's Kingdom from the denominational system took him to another place Abraham had the seventh seal the secret passage of how to truly get up there so when the seventh seal was manifested God the judge let's say a cloud came down and a revelation was given to Abraham that this system of nimrod wasn't going to function they wouldn't get to heaven because now there's a confusion of languages therefore he came out of the denominational system went to another place and encountered the architect of the Heavenly Kingdom he found MDC and our eighth messenger is is MDC the seventh messenger the seventh seal was revealed judgement for for Nimrod but it was an exodus and a Rapture Resurrection a rejuvenating for Abraham what really caught my attention when I went to Salvador was when they took me to that place called the Gate of of the door of the devil because here Babel Babel means uh the gates To Paradise or the gates to to God B A is is door is and a l is God or e l is God and in different parts of the Bible you can see that God is in different names Bethlehem like Bethlehem Bethesda Bethesda now Babel was the door to God or the gate to God but Nimrod did not accept the provided way that was already constituted by Enoch by faith you get to heaven he wanted to do it this through science this age of laa received its seventh seal but since La crucified the message they crucified the Christ of their day all that's left is Judgment but while we're here we're not under that Lan anointing which is rich but does not know that they're blind and naked and miserable just like Nimrod was rich God showed him he was nothing your money your science won't take you to Heaven accept God's provided Way by faith you'll get to heaven faith in the secret passage which is Jesus Christ our blood that will take us up there in the message Investments remember Babel was called the door to God but then God shut the door but L we find all the church AG all the other Church ages Jesus was still in the church but on the Lan age he was outside knocking trying to get in and this is the age when the manifestation of Christ comes so perfect in the image of Christ in his church until the churches as the brother said a while ago is closing the door and yet he stands with love knocking If any man hunger or thirst brother Bram knocked on the pulpit do you understand the congregation says amen you wait a closed door it's the L age but we're not a part of La we've come out of her perverse teachings denominational systems our Kingdom's not here but as while we're here the spiritual kingdom is manifested the true sons of God and they're finding the secret passages psalms 27 verse one for those that know brother uses Psalms 27 to preach the Rapture the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is my the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid verse two says when the wicked even my enemies and foes Came Upon me you see the different groups that come the alliance and Confederation of the devil persecuting the true seed of God to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host should though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me I will be confident so a army shall come a war shall come against you but your Escape your seventh seal your secret passage he'll reveal it here one thing I've desired of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and it says to inquire inquire to find the secret passage investigate just like when you're in a house and there's a a a cabinet where there's books and you take uh one of the books and then it opens up that entire furniture and that cabinet moves and you find a secret passage and you see secret Pathways that are within the same house that take you to this place to this place quickly that like we go from gen revelation we go toah to Genesis to a territory that has not been truly explored a secret passage that the seven seal will reveal for he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the time of trouble in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me in the secret of his Tabernacle there'll be a time where the Lord himself will come in a physical form I'm going to say this and the ministry of the son of man makes the theophanies come down and the theophanies will come to search for you those Mystic lights those flying saucers start to investigate where the sons of God under a persecution of the devil then you'll find yourself with a secret passage in the Tabernacle entering into a theophany and enter a secret passage of a hidden dimension that the devil's seed is this close to getting but since they don't accept Jesus Christ they don't accept God's provided way God closes the door but for us he opens it let us all stand and the message Christ is revealed in his own word no we could have got any continuity amongst Medics amongst scientists different ones you see the devil's Kingdom if Einstein only had the spiritual application as he had the physical application just see how close Einstein got how close this the devil seed gets just as close as Cain got and Nimrod but did not take the spiritual part which is the Revelation if Einstein only had the spiritual application as he had the physical application as he studied the laws of the light and so forth he could have told us something when I heard his message on the great Center somewhere into the skies that ever contacted with that Center would create Earths do anything and the power would be Unlimited see he had seen that you see these little pockets going through the air they call saucers and so forth people that well we better leave that alone hear all the people come up missing you say don't hear from them they're standing there and they're not there that's the way the Rapture is going to be one of them will drop right down this terrestrial body will take on the celestial body and there'll be bones left there'll be their High hair and Bones left it'll be transformed in a moment time dropping right out of space and taking home that we see all that going on now and the Pentagon wondering about these lights and these Mystic lights and everything they're seeing in the sky you seen they had one here at the paper at Jeffersonville this week and so forth a Mystic light so they don't I don't know what that is but listen little children it's going to pick you up one of these days you see don't worry let us pray Heavenly Father we know that there's something false and something real in things and the world has painted us a picture of flying saucers as something false but because of Revelation that you've given through the seventh seal the secret passage was open of what a flying saucer is now allow your flying saucer your Mystic light of the Holy Ghost that just one could enter in contact with the light through faith nor conscience nor money nothing carnal just Faith contacts that flying SAU help us Lord prepare us there have been many signs that you'll manifest in the seventh seal physically bless us Lord bless this service in the name of the
