foreign Augustine power that you've given us yes [Music] personal [Music] ity in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen uh standing I like to read one portion of the Bible is chapter 1 verse 1 to 3. [Music] since you can say Amen once you have it foreign [Music] this is a Suarez which rain from India even on to Ethiopia over 107 and 20 provinces that in those days when the king of Suarez sat on the throne of his kingdom which was in shusan the palace is the third year of his Reign he made a feast onto all the prince princes and his servants of the power of Persia and media the Nobles and princes of the promises being before him as well [Music] and originally I had another thought uh but to begin I want to speak about this the subject is concerning Esther is and it's the dispensational feast uh is and at that time it was the Jews that were found under that law [Music] it says now it came to pass in the days of a Suarez this is a Suarez which rain from India even on to Ethiopia in the next image I have a photo okay where it shows where it's India where is India Indonesia Ethiopia and we're in Ethiopia is you see that India is found on the eastern part of the world Ethiopia and to go to Ethiopia one has to travel to the west of the world so the reign of this king is when from the East to the West it first rises in the East and sets on the west now follow me close civilization has traveled con El Sol with the sun we all know that it is I came from the east across over into Germany across the Mediterranean into Germany from Germany across the English Channel English into England from there across the Atlantic into United States now the East and the West has met the gospel also travels from the East to the West we are found in the western part of the world it started in the East principlements the people that we know that live in the eastern part of the world which the Bible speaks about there are the Jews so this King had a feast so in Esther one two this is in the third year of his Reigns Feast onto all the princes and servants the power of Persian media the Nobles and princes of the promises being before him and his Nobles the strongman of his of his reign the power of that rain so that the gospel began with the Jews we know the Jews come from the nation of Israel how many you know of Jacob okay and his name was changed to Israel and the scripture Genesis 32 28. if you have your Bible today is going to read several scriptures Genesis 32 28 this is Thy Name shall be called No More Jacob but Israel for as a prince has thou power with God and with men and has prevailed see the name is and has power with God says is the first seal this is but one night he caught on hold of something real yes and he knows that it was something realism and he stayed with it and held until he overcome until you overcome his name was changed to Israel meaning a prince with power before God is so the first Feast that this King had is the most powerful men with in his Reigns when God started the kingdomen he started with Israel with the nation remember the servants has always been God's servants is the Jews Abraham was a servant Los Angeles the Gentiles are not the servants it's the brideos it's a son this is the sun the churches the Jews are the servants it was the Nobles of his Reigns remember keep your your the Bible at your hand Exodus 24 9. and seven of the Elders of Israel is and they saw that the god of Israel and there was under his feet as they were paved the work of a sapphire stone as they were the body of heaven and his clearness principles and upon the Nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand also they saw God and did eat and drink in Spanish it says that the powers of the of the men or the princes of of Israel in English and in English is the noble men of Israel Fiesta so when that first [Music] the Jews are the first one to receive the Gospel and be there and I will give thee tables of stone and the law and Commandments which I have written and thou mayest teach them we're reading a lot about Moses in the wilderness and we're reading that that type of the first Feast that this King had when Moses went to Pharaoh is these are the words that he said unto pharaoh and exodus in Exodus 5 1. this is and afterwards Moses and Aaron went in and told Pharaoh thus said to the Lord God of Israel let my people go that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness what type of feast was this when the King has its first Feast tells us the reason why he had this feasters when they show The Riches of his glorious Kingdom in the honor of his excellent Majesty many days and even 104 score days so if someone reads the scripture in a superficial way you might think that this king is is boasting foreign he said he was going to harden Pharaoh's heart and there was Darkness all over the kingdom there was light in Goshen even though they're found in a place called The Wilderness and if a snake was to be in the wilderness and that snake was to bite you God told Moses this is lift up that brass serpentes whoever that looks upon that breast surface the time came when they were thirsty in this Exodus it was God preaching them the gospel is in the book of Galatians 3 78 this is which are of Faith the same are the children of Abraham located and the scripture foreseen that God would justify the Heathen through faith preach before the gospel unto abrahamas in English and it says in English He preached the gospel and the gospel is not just words it's a demonstration of God's power so when God preached to Abraham he said you should have a son not only did he say it to him with the power of His glory to show him that he does what he says it's the Feast of the Gospel preaching regards of his kingdom and it was only for Israel also in Psalms 145 verse 9 it says the Lord is good to all and his Tender Mercies are over all his words all thy works are praise thee O Lord and thy Saint shall bless thee La Gloria that shall speak of the glory of that Kingdom and talk of thy power Los Angeles to make known the sons of the men of his mighty acts and the Glorious Majesty of his kingdom is the kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom and thy Dominion under withdrawal Generations so God wants to show the gospel he wanted to preach them the gospel showing them that there's no God so great as he is there is no one else that can heal you like he can heal you know they will take care of you more better than he can yeah it was him preaching the gospel showing the power that he has Abraham's Covenant in the beginning he was self-existing one and him was attributes to be a father to be a savior to be a Healer yes all these things only display for his attributes see that's what it is because God is an object of worship so he created angels so he could be God is and then he put man on free moral Agency for his own Holiness Salvador then he became a savior he's just displaying his attributes is the king showing in this Feast the glory of his Reigns God's showing his powers there's not no other God like me all right and Romanos and Romans chapter 9. speaking again about Moses he said Romans 9 15. this is Mercy on whom I will have mercy in our compassion whom I will have compassion so then it's not of him that willeth nor of him that runeth but of God that showeth Mercy for the scripture says for this same purpose I have raised the up that I might show my my power and that my name might be declared through all the Earth why is let all this happen in Exodus to show The Riches of his power of His Reign is the same thing this King did and it's Supreme and supreme in this first Feast it was the Feast of the Gospel Israel notorious what if God willing to show his wrath and or to make his power known endured with much long-suffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction that he might make known The Riches of his glory Gloria on the vessels of Mercy which has been prepared unto Glory esto is called not of the Jews only but also of the Gentiles you can see that Paul speaks speaks about Moses and Pharaoh he loses and it types both as one of honor and one of dishonors through these vessels to show the power of his glory celebrated but then in verse 24 it says because even us whom he had called not of the Jews only but also of the Gentiles because the gospel travels from the East to the west to you Los cantiles to the Gentiles so God in his first Feast is the gospel but this King had another Feast one five these days were expired the king made a feast onto all the people that were present in Suzanne the palace both on to Great and Small seven days in the court of the garden of the king's Palace so the the list of the people who are invited is from the the greatest to the smallest you remember about Peter when he told them what must we do Peter said unto them repent to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost yes it's for whosoever from the from the greatest to the smallest is invited to the second feast when it begins to describe the garden this is a white green blue hangings fasting with cords of fine linen and purple and silver rings and pillars of marble the beds were of gold and silver silver upon a pavement of red and blue and white and black and marble the first thing this pavement had several colors the first one was white then green then blue yeah and brother Rams tells us these colors have uh significance he says in Hebrews chapter 7 part two this is how we've had time to to give those colors to show that each one of those colors represents God's Purity amen those colors there are seven natural colors those colors represents the purity of God is these colors represent the motors of God and the attitude of God begins to describe the different colors that were in this Garden in primeros Blanco the first one is pureness this is the green representative it represents life it is represents the trueness and a perfect Fellowship and then we go back to the first Feast it was a feast that God had with the Jews remember what we read in Exodus when God calls Moses Moses and Aaron and two other men and then 70 elders but not everyone was able to reach the top of the mountain only Moses was able to get up there because he got up there to receive the laws the Commandments but when they were down there on the earth they saw that up there in heaven in English you said there was a pavement they saw God's feet like a pavement of sapphire but that's under the law has gone up to heaven but he that is descended from heaven and quickly he speaks about his crucifixion and we go back to Moses he said that no one can go up there only Moses they were able to see the pavement on that rock but we are no longer under the law when a person diesel they do go to heaven where since we were white green and blue hangings fasting with cords of Finland and purple to silver rings and pillows of marble the beds were of gold and silver upon a pavement of red and blue and white and black marble in English once again in English it says this is a pavement upon a pavement that there was they're walking upon the pavement when a Christian is born again he has the capacity to go to Heavenly places in Christ Jesus you have the opportunity you don't literally just go up there but brother Ram says that were found in Heavenly places it says our position that we have in the body of Christ you as a Christian born again the Feast of Greece you have the capacity to go up to Heavenly places to walk upon the God's pavement has the capacity to go to Heavenly places and you as a Believer your faith is to be able to walk upon that pavement and the foundation was also part of marble all right says the next position of the seven Church ages now he's going to make the Overcomer a pillar in that Temple but what is a pillars a pillar is actually a part of the foundation for it holds up for the superstructure he's giving him the revelation of the word and of himself because that is exactly what the apostles and Prophets had Foundation now Abraham was the foundation of Faith let's say he had four foundations the foundation of Faith was Abraham and fundamentals the foundation of love was Isaac foreign you go to the Garden of the palace of the garden of the palace the devil also gets in there remember it's in the garden of the palace just like it was in a Garden of Eden just like Satan detectives just like in the Garden of Gethsemane Jesus this is where Jesus found with his greatest battle the Bible says in the Song of Solomon Cinco Uno 5-1 they say jovina means I've come into my garden my sister my spouse I have gathered my murder and my spice and I've eaten my honeycomb with my honey and I have drunk my wine with my milk ital friends drink gay drink abundantly oh beloved if you read all this chapter he speaks about this woman that is seeking this this man and she calls him my beloved so when she begins to speak about it she begins to speak of the damsels there of Jerusalem that his hands were as gold rings set with the barrel his belly is the bright ivory overlaid with sapphires he says he said his legs are as pillars of marble so in the second Feast it's found in the court Garden of the Palace of the king so that Satan can also get in the gardens because he's been there with them many times in the past the devil can find or get in the garden to get in that feast one seven so when the king had his feast and they gave them drinking bezels of gold the vessels being the verse from one to another and Royal wine and abundance according to the state of the king is the drinking was according to the law none that compelled for so the king had appointed to all the officers of the house that it should be due according to Every Man's pleasure so one thing I want you to notice that in the second piece he begins to speak about wine in Los basos De Oro and the vessels of gold we begin to speak about Moses in Romans 9 spoke about Moses and pharaoh and the people that got close to him they were very sinful cambiano La Fiesta and then changing the feast under the Grace under the blood of Jesus Christ that takes away all of your sins you come to the feast now you're a vessel of gold now your God in human flesh and he fills you with the wine que esvino what is wine is La estimulation it's the stimulation of the revelation of Jesus Christ it means perfect Fellowship God in you before it was God above us when God came in human flesh it was God With Us it's the Feast of Pentecost it came out of the upper room and the people that saw them they thought that they were drunk he would do it with the whole group he would do what the whole nation of Israel it was God above them there's different sizes of vessels Iglesia which they're filled with it's a personal with you and God it's it's a vessel of gold according its own size and God will fill you with wine one time brother Ram said this is what is the new birth he says it's the revelation of Jesus Christ revealed to you the people of Israel were literally captured they were literally thirsty they were literally hungry but now in the second phase you received your freedom of the Captivity of sins spiritual you have spiritual thirst foreign it's more intimate what he wants to have with you it's a personal revelation with you he says that God is more closer to you than your right hand now we're walking upon the pavement when Moses went to the mountains he went up there with 70 elders he Jesus if you remember Jesus also he had 70 ministers with him to the missionary field and when they got back from the missionary Field Report Jesus they began to give Jesus the missionary reports and how they shared how the Devils were subject to his name and Jesus replies I see Satan falling from heaven like like lightning I've given power unto you to tread upon serpents yes us you now have the capacity to tread or walk upon him come in many places to walk over the kingdom of the devil why because you have your your vessel of wine what is the wine the wine or the rest of Revelation that you receive is and the most powerful thing there is against the the kingdom of the of the devil is the Revelation that you personally receive remember in the first Feast the people of Israel were captive they needed a revelation that God was a deliverer in the desert they were they were hungry they near the Revelation to food now it's more personal now it's not just for the whole group now it's a individual Revelation to you if someone is struggling with something sin God can reveal to you I'll still reveal himself to you God preaches the gospel in both Feasts he knows the wine that you need and reveals itself personally to you does it matter your problem in the second piece it's a more intimate Feast that he wants to have with you there's a special wine the wine of the king as the Bible says that this wine was in abundance you remember what brother Ram says the God is like that great ocean you can never find the the the bottom it's in the whole ocean the wine that he provides once in a while and wine that maketh glad the heart of man El Vino this is the wine is is one time Brothers he says what is the anointment that God uses to anoint the temple this is the joy of the Lord and if your your wine is running low the once in a while God will come and fill your wine once again like David said father restore to me the joy of my salvation you know fill me with wine once again my wine is running low I know that you're a vessel of gold it is your god in human flesh but my wine is running low Fresco I need fresh wine a fresh Revelation that you are still Jehovah Jireh your Jehovah Rapha yeah whatever personal revelation it is God already knows it is remember it's more of an intimate Feast the king knows you more intimately in this feast there was uh leads out there with the group La neces the need of the Church of the people of Israel but now on the second piece it is your own personal individual need diosante is God was dealing with them as a form of a group and now God is dealing with his people but individually the wine that I need the wine that you need it's the most more intimate Feast that he has that this person that comes to the feast it's a personal revelation it's a personal wine that he has prepared for you that God knows that you need let it stand s let us power heads is to the wine of revelation we understand that we were invited to the second Feast that's in the garden of the king that is filled with wine there's people here Lord you want to review yourself personally to that person I like a Healer I personally there's people that are found at the people in Egypt they're in captivity but the Captivity of their sins reveal yourself Lord to that person as a deliverer [Music] Jesus Christ Lord yes [Music] only Jesus can satisfy your soul amen [Music] foreign [Music] holy Jesus your soul [Music] and the holy [Music] can't change your life and
