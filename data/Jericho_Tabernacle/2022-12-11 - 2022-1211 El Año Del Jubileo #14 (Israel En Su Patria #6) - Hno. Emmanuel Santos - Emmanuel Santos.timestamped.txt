[1:01:37] handsome in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:01:39] amen amen
[1:01:44] it's like we're standing I like to read
[1:01:46] two scriptures
[1:01:49] first one is found in Revelations the
[1:01:52] first chapter in verse 5.
[1:01:56] [Music]
[1:01:58] the Bible says
[1:02:11] and from Jesus Christ was faithful
[1:02:13] witness and the first begotten of the
[1:02:15] dead and the prince of the kings of the
[1:02:16] earth unto him that loved us and washed
[1:02:18] us from our sins and his own blood
[1:02:20] is
[1:02:28] made us Kings and Priests unto the gods
[1:02:31] and his father to him be the glory and
[1:02:33] Dominion forever and ever amen
[1:02:37] I like to also read Matthew 12.
[1:02:41] starting with the first verse foreign
[1:02:45] [Music]
[1:03:00] at the time Jesus went out on the
[1:03:03] Sabbath day through the corn and the
[1:03:04] disciples were hungered and began to
[1:03:06] pluck the ears of the Corn and to eat
[1:03:14] but when the first you saw it they said
[1:03:17] unto him behold the disciples do that
[1:03:19] which is not lawful to do upon the
[1:03:21] Sabbath day
[1:03:22] is
[1:03:29] read what David did when he was hungered
[1:03:32] and they that were with him
[1:03:34] foreign
[1:03:47] which was not lawful for him to eat you
[1:03:49] know for them which were with him but
[1:03:51] only for the priests is
[1:04:01] or have you not read in the law how that
[1:04:03] on the Sabbath days the priest and the
[1:04:05] temple profane the Sabbath and and are
[1:04:07] blameless
[1:04:12] but I say unto you that in this place
[1:04:14] for one is greater than the temple is
[1:04:23] but if you had not but if you had known
[1:04:26] what this minute I will have mercy and
[1:04:28] not sacrifice you will not have
[1:04:30] condemned the guilty the Guiltless
[1:04:34] for the son of man is the Lord even of
[1:04:37] the Sabbath day
[1:04:37] [Music]
[1:04:40] please the bless the reading of his word
[1:04:42] you may take your seats
[1:04:46] [Music]
[1:04:55] that is
[1:05:00] the Kings and Priests
[1:05:05] and we now we know what the Bible is
[1:05:11] divided into main or principle points
[1:05:16] what is Law and what the other one is
[1:05:18] Grace
[1:05:21] now we're Kings and Priests
[1:05:24] spiritually speaking
[1:05:30] the priests were separated from the
[1:05:33] Kings
[1:05:36] if you started the genealogy
[1:05:39] uh
[1:05:41] you saw that the priest came from the
[1:05:43] tribe of
[1:05:45] levias and the Kings
[1:05:48] or these men that were Governors
[1:05:53] came from the tribe of
[1:05:55] judahismo and Jesus Christ himself is
[1:05:59] king of kings
[1:06:01] and he is high priest
[1:06:03] entrances so then
[1:06:06] under the law is
[1:06:09] those two offices
[1:06:12] were separated
[1:06:15] the priest had their job
[1:06:18] and the Kings also had their job
[1:06:20] they could not mix
[1:06:23] but with Grace
[1:06:25] those two are united
[1:06:29] and we're going to enter that in a few
[1:06:31] moments
[1:06:34] now we know that the Bible says
[1:06:37] that the law was a
[1:06:39] Shadows of good things that were to come
[1:06:44] one of those things
[1:06:49] of the priesthood
[1:06:51] and royalty
[1:06:54] foreign
[1:07:43] foreign
[1:08:45] always told us that David always typed
[1:08:48] Christ
[1:08:49] because Christ is King and he's priest
[1:08:55] so when Jesus was I was walking to this
[1:08:58] field
[1:09:00] he was the anti-type
[1:09:03] of what David did in time
[1:09:07] David as a king and to the temple and
[1:09:10] ate the bread Jesus Christ
[1:09:12] now Jesus is our King
[1:09:14] who governs us
[1:09:18] but he also gives us bread to feed us
[1:09:21] foreign
[1:10:07] who was 16 years old and made him King
[1:10:09] in the room of his father amaziah
[1:10:13] now we have a king here in the tribe of
[1:10:15] Judah this is on the 16th verse
[1:10:23] and it says but when he was strong his
[1:10:26] heart was lifted up for up to his
[1:10:28] Destruction
[1:10:35] for he transgressed against the Lord his
[1:10:38] God and went into the Temple of the Lord
[1:10:40] to burn incense upon the altar of
[1:10:42] incense
[1:10:45] wanted to do the work of a priest
[1:10:50] but the result of what he did
[1:10:54] was the opposite of what happened to
[1:10:56] David
[1:10:57] on the 26th verse
[1:11:00] 17.
[1:11:08] and azeriah the priests winning after
[1:11:11] him and with him four score Priests of
[1:11:13] the Lord that were Valiant men
[1:11:15] foreign
[1:11:31] to burn incense unto the Lord but to the
[1:11:34] priests the sons of Aaron
[1:11:39] porqueas
[1:11:43] that are consecrated to burn incense go
[1:11:46] out of the sanctuary for thou has
[1:11:48] trespassed neither shall it be for thine
[1:11:50] honor from The Lord of God
[1:11:54] foreign
[1:12:05] incense and while he was Wrath with the
[1:12:07] priests the leprosy even rose up in his
[1:12:10] forehead before the priests of the house
[1:12:11] of the Lord from beside the answers of
[1:12:13] altar
[1:12:27] the chief priests and all the priests
[1:12:30] looked upon him and behold he was
[1:12:31] leprous in his forehead and they trust
[1:12:34] in him out from the fence yea himself
[1:12:36] hasted also to go out because the Lord
[1:12:38] had submitted him
[1:12:42] so this king is taking a job that did
[1:12:46] not pertain to him
[1:12:49] because the Kings and Priests were
[1:12:51] separated
[1:12:53] I can't find where brother Branham says
[1:13:00] but he does say that David was a type of
[1:13:03] Christ
[1:13:04] that's why David being a king is
[1:13:09] something illegally or that was did not
[1:13:12] pertain to him
[1:13:14] but regardless nothing happened to him
[1:13:18] because David was a type of Christ is
[1:13:22] Christ is the king of kings
[1:13:24] and he is the high priest
[1:13:27] and it wasn't just only David
[1:13:31] it was David and the men that were with
[1:13:33] him
[1:13:34] that's Jesus Christ
[1:13:36] that is
[1:13:38] and high priests
[1:13:41] and you are a king and a high priest
[1:13:44] just like David had men that follow him
[1:13:48] we are following the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:13:52] and we are the body
[1:13:55] foreign
[1:14:55] even to pick up the bread
[1:14:59] so that day of Sabbath is very important
[1:15:02] in the law
[1:15:04] if it was something that was broken
[1:15:08] the penalty was very strong
[1:15:11] and exodus
[1:15:13] on verse 8 this is
[1:15:19] remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy
[1:15:22] says
[1:15:24] six days shout out labor and do all thy
[1:15:27] Work
[1:15:28] is
[1:15:32] but the seventh day is the Sabbath of
[1:15:34] the Lord thy God and thou shall not do
[1:15:36] any work
[1:15:43] thy son or thy daughter thy man servant
[1:15:47] nor thy maidservant nor thy cattle nor
[1:15:49] thy stranger that is within thy Gates
[1:16:02] for the six days the Lord made Heaven
[1:16:05] and Earth a sea and all that is in that
[1:16:07] in the amazing rest of the seventh day
[1:16:08] were for the Lord bless the Sabbath day
[1:16:10] and hallowed it
[1:16:13] so these priests
[1:16:17] we're breaking the Sabbath day
[1:16:20] and nothing would happen to them
[1:16:22] because the priest
[1:16:25] they came from a very special tribe
[1:16:28] of the tribe of Levi
[1:17:03] there's a reverence that we must keep
[1:17:06] here in the sanctuary
[1:17:08] no one should move so much
[1:17:12] or cause a lot of noise
[1:17:17] we know that our dear brethren
[1:17:20] the deacons
[1:17:22] they move from place to place
[1:17:26] they speak amongst themselves
[1:17:28] and no one tells them anything
[1:17:32] because that is their duty to do that is
[1:17:36] there are they're without
[1:17:40] faults
[1:17:42] they're commissioned to carry that works
[1:17:47] but have any of us who are sitting here
[1:17:51] begin to move and speak to each other
[1:17:54] they're going to call our attention
[1:17:57] same thing with these priests
[1:18:00] you can't break the Sabbath day
[1:18:04] but these priests
[1:18:08] because these men were commissioned to
[1:18:10] do so
[1:18:11] that's why they were out there they were
[1:18:14] not guilty
[1:18:15] David and
[1:18:35] not just him but the men that were with
[1:18:37] him and nothing happened
[1:18:42] because David was a type of Christ
[1:18:45] o now Christ is
[1:18:50] now he is our Sabbath day
[1:19:03] which is Saturday
[1:19:05] is
[1:19:08] I started thinking should we not work on
[1:19:11] Saturdays
[1:19:13] and write today this morning
[1:19:17] I was reading on the Sabbath day
[1:19:21] they asked a question to brother Branham
[1:19:24] if there's a scripture
[1:19:28] that authorizes us to keep the Sunday
[1:19:33] like the Jews keep the Sabbath
[1:19:38] there is no such thing
[1:19:40] there's no such scripture in the Bible
[1:19:44] for the New Testament Grace
[1:19:50] for us to keep the Sabbath or the Sunday
[1:19:55] but the reason why we keep Sunday is
[1:19:59] a memorial of the Resurrection
[1:20:04] foreign
[1:20:17] there
[1:20:49] and had these seven golden candlesticks
[1:20:53] and there was an altar of incense
[1:20:57] now the king of Zaya tomorrow
[1:21:02] now he took the work of the incense
[1:21:06] and David took the job of the bread
[1:21:10] both men blasphemit
[1:21:14] de Cristo but David was the type of
[1:21:16] Christ
[1:21:21] Leviticus the 24th chapter
[1:21:23] on verse 5.
[1:21:28] here we speak about this bread
[1:21:31] this is
[1:21:37] and thou shall take fine fine flower and
[1:21:40] make 12 cakes thereof two cents deals
[1:21:43] shall be one cake
[1:21:46] says
[1:21:50] and thou shalt set them in two rows six
[1:21:52] on a row upon the pure table before the
[1:21:55] Lord
[1:21:56] is
[1:22:03] pure frankincense upon each role that it
[1:22:06] may be on the bread or for a memorial
[1:22:07] even as even an offering made by fire
[1:22:10] unto the Lord
[1:22:18] every Sabbath he shall set in order
[1:22:20] before the Lord continually being taken
[1:22:22] from the children of Israel by an
[1:22:24] Everlasting Covenant is
[1:22:35] Sons and they shall eat in a holy place
[1:22:38] for his most holy unto him for of the
[1:22:41] offerings of the Lord made by fire by
[1:22:43] Perpetual statute
[1:22:45] something I want you to see
[1:22:49] only in the tribe of Levi
[1:22:52] were able or allowed to eat those breads
[1:22:57] and every Sabbath day though those bread
[1:23:00] were being changed
[1:23:02] if you remember this is
[1:23:04] something very important
[1:23:08] and First Chronicles 9 32
[1:23:11] de los Hijos Hermanos
[1:23:15] and the other Brethren are the sons of
[1:23:17] the coatites
[1:23:23] now these are descendants of the tribe
[1:23:25] of Levi it is
[1:23:34] to prepare it every Sabbath
[1:23:45] every Sabbath the showbread was being
[1:23:47] changed
[1:23:52] Samuel now let us read for Samuel
[1:23:55] on the 21st chapter is
[1:23:58] now this is a story of David when he
[1:24:01] goes to the temple this is
[1:24:12] amalek the priests and amalek was afraid
[1:24:15] at the meeting of David and said unto
[1:24:17] him why are thou alone and no man with
[1:24:19] thee is
[1:24:33] the priest the king had commanded me a
[1:24:35] business and has said unto me let no man
[1:24:37] know anything of the business where
[1:24:39] about I Cindy and what I have commanded
[1:24:41] thee and I've appointed my servants to
[1:24:43] church in such a place
[1:24:49] now therefore what is under thy hand
[1:24:50] give me five loaves of bread in my hands
[1:25:02] and the priest answer David and said
[1:25:04] there is no common bread under my hand
[1:25:06] but there is a hollow bread if the young
[1:25:08] men have kept themselves at least from
[1:25:10] women
[1:25:27] of a truth woman have been kept from us
[1:25:30] about three these three days since I
[1:25:32] came out and the vessels of the young
[1:25:33] men are holy and the bread is in a
[1:25:35] manner of common yea though I were
[1:25:37] Sanctified this day in the vessel is
[1:25:51] so the priest gave him hollow bread for
[1:25:53] there was no bread there but the shoe
[1:25:55] bread that was taken from before the
[1:25:57] Lord to put hot bread in the day when it
[1:25:59] was taken away all right something very
[1:26:02] important
[1:26:03] all these things that we're reading
[1:26:05] about
[1:26:08] we're gonna we're gonna read them and
[1:26:10] explain why they're so important
[1:26:13] but David came in a very specific name
[1:26:17] he didn't come on a Monday
[1:26:20] on a Tuesday or Wednesday
[1:26:23] he got there on a Saturday
[1:26:27] there where the bread was being
[1:26:29] exchanged
[1:26:30] that's something that's very key
[1:26:34] there where the bread was being
[1:26:36] exchanged
[1:26:38] there were the food was being exchanged
[1:26:58] now we're speaking about the bread is
[1:27:08] how is he going to give us his body to
[1:27:11] eat
[1:27:12] he said well now we know
[1:27:17] we believe Moses
[1:27:20] Moses is our Prophet
[1:27:22] We Believe Moses
[1:27:27] and our fathers was fed in the
[1:27:29] wilderness for 40 years
[1:27:31] he said I know that
[1:27:36] he said I know that but every one of
[1:27:38] them is dead
[1:27:40] he said but I am the bread of life
[1:27:42] foreign
[1:28:04] what happened in the natural in the Old
[1:28:07] Testaments
[1:28:10] it was a type that was going to happen
[1:28:11] in the spiritual in the New Testament
[1:28:14] so in the natural
[1:28:16] in the old
[1:28:19] testamentes
[1:28:22] only the priests were allowed to eat
[1:28:25] in undergrace
[1:28:29] there has to be bread where only the
[1:28:31] Believers have to eat in Israeli like
[1:28:34] Israel nutrition before
[1:28:37] paragraph 14 this is
[1:28:47] how the war in the Tabernacles
[1:28:51] how the Brazen altar the lever
[1:28:54] proposition the showbread
[1:28:58] everything pointed to Christ
[1:29:01] and in him we are completing Jesus
[1:29:04] Christ
[1:29:05] now what does the bread
[1:29:07] representation
[1:29:11] Hebrews chapter 7 part 2.
[1:29:14] paragraph 344. This is
[1:29:19] but the Perfection has come to the place
[1:29:25] that the middle person now there happens
[1:29:27] to be a Jew here
[1:29:30] or somebody that understands the old
[1:29:32] testamento
[1:29:34] to prove it let me show you
[1:29:38] I haven't got the Old Testament with me
[1:29:41] this is the New Testament
[1:29:45] but in the offering of the show bread
[1:29:51] that was laying on the kosher plate in
[1:29:53] the Jewish sacrifice
[1:29:56] at the cleansing of the Tabernacles
[1:30:03] ask any Jew on those three pieces of
[1:30:05] bread
[1:30:07] partido the middle the middle piece was
[1:30:09] broken
[1:30:10] that was Christ
[1:30:13] the middle the middle piece was broken
[1:30:16] cries in the between
[1:30:20] so that there had to be a breaking in
[1:30:23] algun aparte somewhere
[1:30:26] for Redemption yes
[1:30:31] and that piece was considered Redemption
[1:30:34] on the kosher bread and here he is
[1:30:40] and tonight when we take communion
[1:30:44] we break the kosher bread porque es el
[1:30:48] cuerpo de Cristo for it's the body of
[1:30:51] Christ
[1:30:53] and he was broken at Calvary
[1:30:57] to be a Pro Vision for our sin foreign
[1:32:28] that we feed off
[1:32:34] the Bible says we're the dead body or
[1:32:37] the dead carcass is
[1:32:38] there were the Eagles will be gathered
[1:32:48] I'm going to read another quote and then
[1:32:53] God's only provided place of worship
[1:32:58] and the mule offering that was given to
[1:33:01] Christ is
[1:33:08] and the meal offering must be grounded
[1:33:11] with a certain verb foreign
[1:33:37] [Music]
[1:33:58] but the Jews can't explain it yet why
[1:34:01] they do it
[1:34:03] and all these other things typed him
[1:34:08] now then him
[1:34:12] now we now we see now all denominations
[1:34:16] and Creeds left behind us
[1:34:21] for he is the pure unchangeable
[1:34:25] word of God which is the unleavened
[1:34:28] bread
[1:34:29] Saint John one that's right
[1:34:31] he is the unleavened bread
[1:34:36] so when you add this or that is
[1:34:41] it is 11 added to that what's already
[1:34:44] been originally given to you
[1:34:46] Jesus and the body of Jesus
[1:34:49] it was the original bread that was given
[1:34:51] out to Calvary
[1:34:54] there's several types of bread
[1:34:59] there's the showbread
[1:35:03] now when when Manna came down
[1:35:07] says
[1:35:13] and put it there in a basket
[1:35:17] and to put in the Holy place
[1:35:22] that's something very important I tres
[1:35:27] partes now there are three parts of the
[1:35:30] Tabernacle now the outer courts the holy
[1:35:34] place and the holies of holies
[1:35:41] now there's also three types of light
[1:35:44] and the outer courts
[1:35:46] one has the light of the natural sun
[1:35:50] and the light of the natural light of
[1:35:53] the stars and now in the Holy place
[1:35:57] there were seven golden candlesticks
[1:36:00] which he says
[1:36:02] that represent the seven Church ages and
[1:36:06] the Seven Messengers
[1:36:15] Glory was there it says
[1:36:18] so there's bread yeah I lose there's
[1:36:21] light and Tres difference and three
[1:36:23] different parts
[1:36:26] and there's light and the holy and the
[1:36:30] holy place
[1:36:34] that everyone can eat
[1:36:36] only worked or was good for that day
[1:36:40] they could not eat it the next day
[1:36:42] because now it already had worms Los
[1:36:45] panes the breads there are the holy
[1:36:48] place
[1:36:51] it was only good for one Sabbath to the
[1:36:53] next Sabbath
[1:36:54] and they could not eat it no longer
[1:36:59] but the manna that was there in the
[1:37:01] holies of holies
[1:37:03] it never rotten
[1:37:11] now Jesus says there in John chapter 6
[1:37:15] verse 47 he said
[1:37:20] unto you he that believeth on me have
[1:37:22] everlasting life
[1:37:24] I am that bread of life
[1:37:28] your fathers that eat man in the
[1:37:31] wilderness and are dead
[1:37:34] this is the bread which cometh down from
[1:37:37] heaven
[1:37:40] that a man eat may eat thereof and not
[1:37:43] die
[1:37:50] I am the living bread which came down
[1:37:52] from heaven If any man eat this bread he
[1:37:54] shall live forever
[1:37:56] and the bread that I will give is my
[1:37:59] flesh
[1:38:01] which I will give for the life of the
[1:38:03] world
[1:38:05] so there's bread
[1:38:08] we got to know what kind of bread you're
[1:38:10] eating
[1:38:12] a denominational bread those who have
[1:38:15] worms
[1:38:17] or are you there found in the Holy place
[1:38:33] are you a True Believer
[1:38:36] you're eating the bread of your
[1:38:38] messenger
[1:38:41] depending on the bread of what you're
[1:38:43] eating
[1:38:45] is
[1:38:51] six bread in this row it says and six
[1:38:55] going this way
[1:39:08] and
[1:39:12] six is a man's number
[1:39:15] Dia de Lombre man's
[1:39:18] Genesis
[1:39:20] Man was created in Genesis 1 26 on the
[1:39:24] sixth day is
[1:39:27] but seven is God's number
[1:39:30] seventh day God rested
[1:39:33] aura
[1:40:01] through this
[1:40:05] foreign
[1:40:34] the fourth The Mystery of the New
[1:40:37] Testament Church as one body composed
[1:40:39] both Jews and Gentiles
[1:40:42] in that table where the where the breads
[1:40:45] were at is
[1:40:47] there with the seven golden candlesticks
[1:40:50] they represent the seven Church ages
[1:40:54] and the light was lighter The Messengers
[1:41:01] light and
[1:41:18] and a new light that was coming in
[1:41:24] the body of the lord
[1:41:26] it's six and six
[1:41:30] Jews and Gentiles
[1:41:32] through the church ages
[1:41:35] but there's also
[1:41:37] in the Holy place
[1:41:40] the bread of the Holy place
[1:41:46] just like the food was being changed
[1:41:48] from Paul trirenius
[1:41:50] from the the last Church age onto this
[1:41:53] church there was a new bread
[1:41:56] there's new Believers that were coming
[1:41:58] in
[1:42:00] together with a new light
[1:42:03] decent efficient stresses in Ephesians 3
[1:42:06] 6
[1:42:07] against Pablo here's Paul that is
[1:42:09] speaking
[1:42:17] it says that the Gentiles should be
[1:42:19] fellow Heirs of the same body
[1:42:21] participates
[1:42:23] Jesus and partakers of his promise in
[1:42:27] the Christ by the gospel
[1:42:29] so the bread represents
[1:42:32] representative Believers
[1:42:35] spiritual and represent the spiritual
[1:42:37] food okay that the Believers we're
[1:42:40] eating for their appointed time
[1:42:44] First Corinthians 10 17 he says
[1:42:50] for we being many are one bread cuerpo
[1:42:55] for us being many are on one body
[1:42:57] participants
[1:42:59] for we're all partakers of that one
[1:43:02] bread
[1:43:04] this bread was for the priests for the
[1:43:08] Believers
[1:43:09] and every certain time the bread was
[1:43:12] being exchanged
[1:43:13] there was a lapse of time for Ephesus
[1:43:21] and there's also a bread here for the
[1:43:24] church age of laurasia foreign it's the
[1:43:27] message
[1:43:52] continually being taken from the
[1:43:54] children of Israel by an Everlasting
[1:43:55] Covenant
[1:43:57] so when David got to the temple right to
[1:44:00] the temple
[1:44:01] he arrived on the day
[1:44:05] when they were exchanging the old bread
[1:44:08] for the new bread
[1:44:11] it was there he captured a day of
[1:44:14] transition
[1:44:16] spiritual where the spiritual food is
[1:44:19] being exchanged the bread
[1:44:23] the bread represents the body
[1:44:27] so there was a new part of the body that
[1:44:30] was entering in
[1:44:31] this in this momentum it was in that
[1:44:34] moment
[1:44:36] when David arrived
[1:44:41] we already read what David asked for the
[1:44:44] bread
[1:44:45] I'm going to continue reading what
[1:44:47] happened afterwards
[1:44:49] first Samuel 21 8 this is
[1:45:06] not here under thine hand Spirit of
[1:45:08] Sword for I have neither brought my
[1:45:10] sword nor my weapons with me because the
[1:45:12] king's business required haste
[1:45:15] where we're speaking about priests and
[1:45:18] Kings
[1:45:19] a day was a type of Christ
[1:45:24] we're talking about the bread
[1:45:27] that corresponds to the priest
[1:45:30] but in verse 9.
[1:45:37] and the priest said the soul Lord of
[1:45:39] Goliath the Philistines
[1:45:49] behold it is here wrapped in a cloth
[1:45:52] behind the airport security
[1:45:54] if that would take it take it
[1:45:58] for there is no other save that here
[1:46:02] and David said there is none like that
[1:46:05] give it to me
[1:47:01] and the seventh Sabbath is the seventh
[1:47:03] Church years Church ages
[1:47:17] now actually from the 50 days will be
[1:47:19] exactly seven sabbaths is
[1:47:27] seventh Sabbath represented the seven
[1:47:29] Church ages
[1:47:33] to be called in the time of the
[1:47:35] Pentecostal Feast of Pentecost foreign
[1:47:48] the video that David arrived in el dia
[1:47:51] on the day
[1:47:54] where the bread was being exchanged
[1:47:57] now he didn't only just receive his food
[1:48:00] but he received a sword in his hand
[1:48:03] for the second time
[1:48:06] that he used it beforehand
[1:48:09] when he killed Goliath and he killed
[1:48:12] Goliath
[1:48:19] Samuel 17.
[1:48:22] verse 48.
[1:48:27] now here's David confronting Goliath
[1:48:39] and it came to pass when the Philistines
[1:48:41] arose and came and Drew night to me
[1:48:43] David that David hastened and ran toward
[1:48:45] the Army to meet the Philistines
[1:48:57] and David put his hand on his bag and
[1:49:00] took hands of stone and slang it and
[1:49:02] smoked the Philistine on his forehead
[1:49:03] that the stone sunk on his forehead and
[1:49:06] he fell upon his face to the Earth
[1:49:15] so David prevailed over the Philistine
[1:49:17] with a sling and with the stone and
[1:49:19] Samantha Philistine would and slew him
[1:49:21] but there was no sword in the hand of
[1:49:23] David
[1:49:26] so David killed him with the stone he
[1:49:30] did not use a sword
[1:49:44] therefore David ran and stood upon the
[1:49:47] Philistine and took his sword and Drew
[1:49:48] it out the sheath thereof and slew him
[1:49:55] and cut his head off there with and when
[1:49:58] the Philistines saw the champion was
[1:50:00] dead they fled David primero David was
[1:50:03] the first
[1:50:05] but in verse 52 11
[1:50:11] and the men of Israel and Judah Rose
[1:50:13] grittarius
[1:50:17] the Philistines until coming to the
[1:50:19] valley yes
[1:50:26] and they wounded off the Philistines
[1:50:28] fell down by the way of sharing is
[1:50:34] and the children of Israel returned from
[1:50:36] chasing after the Philistines
[1:50:40] and they spoil their tents
[1:50:44] so David was the first important so
[1:50:48] that's very important
[1:50:50] so it's not just David it's David and
[1:50:53] his men
[1:50:54] not just David in the temple
[1:50:58] there was David also and the men that
[1:51:00] were with him
[1:51:01] Not only was it Jesus
[1:51:03] but as Jesus and his disciples
[1:51:07] that is only the physical body of Jesus
[1:51:09] Christ
[1:51:11] but also the mystical body of Jesus
[1:51:13] Christ
[1:51:18] but to put the example
[1:51:21] and you have to follow that example
[1:51:24] but the first one was David
[1:51:27] and he killed him with the stone
[1:51:30] and he took his sword
[1:51:36] that
[1:51:42] before they were scared
[1:51:46] that it was possible to kill those
[1:51:48] giants
[1:51:50] that's the Holy Spirit
[1:51:53] the sword of God
[1:51:56] that he first used with Jesus Christ
[1:52:00] and in our age he used in this age he
[1:52:03] used it with brother Branham because
[1:52:09] not only kills those men he also attacks
[1:52:13] you he attacks me
[1:52:16] so God uses someone as an example
[1:52:20] someone small like David like Jesus like
[1:52:25] brother Branham like an example
[1:52:29] it is possible to kill the giant
[1:52:33] God doesn't see the height
[1:52:36] God sees your heart
[1:52:39] God gives you the faith
[1:52:41] he gives you those five Stones it's fair
[1:52:44] that is Faith Gracia and Grace
[1:52:47] and when David returned back to
[1:53:04] it was very important
[1:53:08] God used someone as an example
[1:53:13] so the devil was only attack only that
[1:53:16] example he attacks and he also attacks
[1:53:20] me
[1:53:22] we already had an example in our age
[1:53:25] doesn't matter who you are
[1:53:30] God can use you
[1:53:34] all right
[1:53:36] now the beautiful thing is
[1:53:42] concerning that story of David and
[1:53:44] Goliath preparation in the message
[1:53:46] preparation
[1:53:48] paragraph 84.
[1:53:51] notice how brother Branham is typing it
[1:53:59] no and here when he went up there just
[1:54:02] dancing in the spirit as hard as he
[1:54:03] could
[1:54:06] Why by faith he saw the victory amen
[1:54:10] he saw the victory
[1:54:14] he took his little old sling in there
[1:54:19] on one of these Stones he gave a dance
[1:54:21] and here he comes coming around
[1:54:26] I can see Goliath saying
[1:54:30] what was it he had five stones
[1:54:34] English is something colettres it's five
[1:54:36] because in English it's five letters the
[1:54:39] word faith and Cinco de dos five fingers
[1:54:43] wrapped is
[1:54:48] the string around j-e-s-u-s
[1:54:51] here he comes
[1:54:53] oh brother look out
[1:54:56] you got to fall
[1:54:59] and when he's Let it Loose
[1:55:06] and the Holy Ghost got a hold of that
[1:55:08] little Old Stone and picked up a speed
[1:55:10] about a thousand miles per second
[1:55:15] between the face and he fell forward
[1:55:18] hallelujah oh my God Jim Crow like a
[1:55:23] little Jim Crow
[1:55:25] dance up there jumped on them
[1:55:27] pulled out a sword
[1:55:30] chopped his head off like that
[1:55:32] say how do you like that boy
[1:55:38] reach down and got him by the hair of
[1:55:40] his head
[1:55:42] says
[1:55:44] come on boys
[1:55:48] let's preach Divine Healing foreign
[1:56:30] Oregon or when the Divine healing powers
[1:56:32] prove that night or Yonder at Portland
[1:56:34] Oregon is
[1:56:38] ran to the platform
[1:56:42] and got through that demon right on the
[1:56:44] ground Tommy Osborne Tommy Osborne Oral
[1:56:47] Roberts Oral Roberts Jaggers Jaggers Los
[1:56:49] Dimas
[1:56:51] the rest of them took turns
[1:56:56] we cut them that was plump to the walls
[1:56:58] Victoria we've got the victory
[1:57:00] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:57:12] God prepared him a man to take care of
[1:57:15] it
[1:57:17] wasn't just only brother Branham
[1:57:20] he had healing campaigns with Tommy
[1:57:24] Osborne it was also Tommy Osborne or
[1:57:25] Robert Roberts Jaggers Jaggers
[1:57:44] [Applause]
[1:57:46] you got to overcome
[1:57:59] and he's going to attack me
[1:58:03] we already have an example
[1:58:05] doesn't matter who you are um
[1:58:08] a young boy from Kentucky
[1:58:11] that nobody would pay attention to him
[1:58:15] and God use them as an example
[1:58:18] that it is possible
[1:58:30] a court trial
[1:58:32] s
[1:58:37] remember God only works through man is
[1:58:44] you could have had the gospel preach to
[1:58:46] the stars or through the trees
[1:58:52] but he chose man is
[1:58:56] that's what he's ever done is
[1:59:01] revealing his secrets
[1:59:03] and his foreign
[1:59:30] and they're the holy spirit said because
[1:59:33] you have challenged the word of God
[1:59:36] tonight you'll fall over my feet
[1:59:40] and remember at first it was
[1:59:43] that challenged the people
[1:59:48] it's not that first we're going to go
[1:59:50] and challenge him
[1:59:53] because we want peace
[1:59:55] want to be left alone
[1:59:58] he's the one who wants the trouble
[2:00:14] God helps us
[2:00:28] now you can imagine a man in that kind
[2:00:30] of Rage
[2:00:35] a man weighing about 128 pounds
[2:00:40] Pizzeria
[2:00:44] he's like a mountain standing before you
[2:00:46] what he thought
[2:00:50] he said I'll show you whose feet I'll
[2:00:53] fall over
[2:00:54] and he jerked back to his big fist
[2:00:57] joining gun momentum memory I never
[2:00:59] moved just stood there yeah
[2:01:03] and he walked up to me and draw back
[2:01:06] like this to hit me
[2:01:08] draw back like this to hit me
[2:01:11] and I heard myself
[2:01:14] nothing that I said at all
[2:01:17] said Satan come out of the man
[2:01:22] no louder than that
[2:01:27] and when he drew back his face his hands
[2:01:29] went up and his eyes pushed the way out
[2:01:37] and went around and around his tongue
[2:01:39] went out and slobbers fell from his
[2:01:41] mouth
[2:01:44] he turned around and around and around
[2:01:46] and fell down and pinned my feet to the
[2:01:47] floor
[2:01:48] we could see now who's David the Branham
[2:01:55] the maniac
[2:01:57] David
[2:02:00] two occasions
[2:02:03] he used the sword of Goliath element
[2:02:06] two occasions
[2:02:09] use a sword in his ministry
[2:02:15] and the healing campaign
[2:02:19] the word of God is
[2:02:22] a two-edged sword
[2:02:25] that reveals
[2:02:28] the secrets are the intent of the heart
[2:02:31] the first sword
[2:02:33] it was revealing it was the discernment
[2:02:38] but also in 1963
[2:02:48] The Sword in his hands
[2:02:51] he said this is the third pool there's
[2:02:55] two stores yes
[2:03:02] he says Redemption is in two portions or
[2:03:05] two parts
[2:03:06] two swords
[2:03:08] and here's the key
[2:03:11] when David went to the temple foreign
[2:03:32] and they said that and it was in that
[2:03:34] age
[2:03:35] when a new portion of the body
[2:03:38] a new bread was entering in
[2:03:41] what portion of the body
[2:03:45] the cloud que Vino that came
[2:03:49] it was in the transition
[2:03:53] of the spiritual food
[2:03:57] when the sword enters in the hand of the
[2:04:00] prophet of God
[2:04:02] it requires sevens
[2:04:06] and seven times seven is 49.
[2:04:10] in the 50th is
[2:04:18] the transition from the 49th year to the
[2:04:21] 50th was what David is
[2:04:27] when he received the sword in his hands
[2:04:32] right before Del jubileo before the
[2:04:35] Jubilee is
[2:04:37] when the sword appears
[2:04:39] in that transition in El Cambio and that
[2:04:43] exchange
[2:04:45] like Joshua
[2:04:50] they're going to enter the promised land
[2:04:54] and before they would take a complete
[2:04:57] position saying foreign
[2:05:40] there's a new that's coming in foreign
[2:06:12] Rey is the king
[2:06:16] 's and Priests
[2:06:19] you are Kings and Priests
[2:06:23] the sword that brother Brandon received
[2:06:26] he'd used it first
[2:06:29] but you have to come to a maturity
[2:06:32] with the word or the sword comes in your
[2:06:34] hand
[2:06:35] but when you use the word we use the
[2:06:39] sword it's going to come out of your
[2:06:41] mouth
[2:06:42] the important thing is
[2:06:47] it comes in the junction
[2:06:59] that's when the short appears
[2:07:02] if you can please stand
[2:07:08] and the message what is the extraction
[2:07:10] on the mountain
[2:07:12] he The Voice came back and said
[2:07:16] not a king sword but
[2:07:19] the king sword
[2:07:22] the word of the lord
[2:07:27] it's only the third pool is
[2:07:30] the Vindication of your ministry
[2:07:34] the message why Christ speak this is
[2:07:38] praying it is
[2:07:43] God give me the courage to take the
[2:07:45] sword of the word
[2:07:50] that he put in my hand about 33 years
[2:07:52] ago
[2:07:57] and holding a March 4th to the third
[2:07:59] pool
[2:08:00] there's two swords those spots
[2:08:03] there's two occasions where David used a
[2:08:06] swords
[2:08:07] two swords in the ministry of brothers
[2:08:10] and both occasions there were men with
[2:08:14] David
[2:08:14] foreign
[2:09:25] that message is our Mana
[2:09:28] is
[2:09:29] also our sword
