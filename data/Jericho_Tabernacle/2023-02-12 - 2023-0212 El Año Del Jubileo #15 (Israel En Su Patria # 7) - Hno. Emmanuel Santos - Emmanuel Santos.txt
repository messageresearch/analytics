this body we have fear and trembling but our soul has trust just like a wife has a trust in her husband just like Esther had trusted approached the king though she was not first called she knew the king would not kill her for he loved her now with that same trust we approach you Lord with our tests with everything we're going through we ask of thy Grace foreign amen just as we're standing I'd like to read one scripture just to begin in Revelation 2 17. you can all say Amen when you have it the word of God says receiving Revelation 2 17 he that hath the near led him here with the spirit saith to the churches to him that overcometh will I give to e of the Hidden Manna and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated I just wanted to give a small missionary report this last weekend his wife and his granddaughter and his son and myself Sonora Mexico we went to some meetings I believe the pastor's name is Luis Ernesto Marquez [Music] and his dick and his brother Ramon Cordova if you remember brother he was with us in the month of December he got to minister on a Friday and in these last months I've traveled a lot to Mexico one of the brothers I've gotten to get to know his brother so then Friday after work we went straight over there we got there in the evening we went there to Saturday morning service he uh before going to the meetings if they give us the opportunity Manuel to speak yeah get ready I was going with the trust confidence knowing that since they don't know me surely they won't put me to speak but Brothers there's other brothers that already know me but when he told me this is Emmanuel get ready because they might ask you to speak I told the brother they don't know me they're going to know you see foreign according to the Bible so for you that searches for an answer you've already got an answer but you're not ready yes that's something that's happened to me in the past years I already had my answer but since I wasn't ready I couldn't recognize that I had the answer is that's why one of the fruits of the spirit is patience now take that for your answer for today Saturday evening we didn't have Fellowship he uh then Sunday morning there was an American brother there I believe from Prescott Arizona Eric Anderson his name is brother Eric Anderson and he asked if I could help him interpret this is so I interpreted for him that morning and immediately after service we have to come back here we didn't even have time to eat what we did is chips and all types of things to eat yeah I see yes I got to meet many brothers over there yeah they send their greetings to our pastor brothers and unto you all the congregations so you received greetings in all different parts of Mexico so now let's enter into the theme for this morning this morning I want to speak about the hidden manner if we go to our Bibles in Hebrews 9 verse 2. Aki Pablo here Paulo now we know Paul was a messenger of the of the Grace Covenant now here Paul under the inspiration of Grace he's speaking about the furniture okay that was in the natural Temple verse 2 he says for there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the Candlestick and the table and the showbread which is called the sanctuary and after the second whale the Tabernacle which is called the holiest of all is the golden censor and the Ark of the Covenant overlaid roundabout with gold wherein was the golden pot that had Manna and Aaron's Rod that budded and the tables of the Covenant I believe we all know that bread representative represents the body of the Lord bread represents classes now there's different types of bread that they were available under Moses there was regular foreign that was in the Holy place then there was the hidden manner that's the most special bread there is not everyone could eat that bread the manner that was for the congregation it just it was served a purpose for that day only then the following day it had worms the showbread only the priests they could eat the bread but then after every Sabbath foreign of the Eternal Light Of God because in the outer courts in the camp of Israel regular yes and then in the holiest of holies that would shine upon that bread so it depends upon what is your life and what is your bread brother says in the burger me in age let's give the interpretation the best we can okay what is a manner that was kept in the place or a showbread that was only for the priest that was like the showbread because the showbread it was a special bread only for the priests it's a Believer that's been born again that's the True Believer he's talking about how that was a special bread not everyone can eat of that bread he continues you see that they had a bread for the congregation but there was a special bread for the priest is that so is this is a special bread um a special bread hidden manner kiss what is it who is our Mana Christo Christ Saint John the sixth chapter 48th to the 50th verse Jesus said that he was the bread of life that come down from God the manner that isn't given unto all the congregations the Revelation is poured out upon the angel of the church the revelation of the words see the revelation of the word is given to the angel of that age and revealed back the hidden manner is addressed to the angel of the church it's a little bigger revelation of what Christ is maybe a little higher call that is the leaders and this man overcame the whole congregation got manner but he got a spec but he got a hidden special manner or a special revelation oh of who Jesus was Jesus because bread represents the body of Jesus and what about him all about him see he had got the Revelation if he had overcome to hold it for if he had overcome addressed to the angel of the church now one more quote the exposition of the seven Church ages the pergamian church age paragraph 241 says his word was bread it was the perfect man what's if what if a man lived by he shall never die but right after the death of the fathers no one seemed to know exactly the truth the exact truth in a short while this manner seemed to have become hidden to the people but in every age God began to give back Revelation that which was hidden until in this last days according to Revelation 10 7 um the prophet will come and reveal all the Mysteries and then the Lord will come now in each age I say the messages received hidden truth but they did not receive it for themselves only but it is as if when it was when the disciples were asked to serve the multitudes Loaves and Fishes Jesus gave them the broken bread but they in turn gave it to the people God gives his hidden manner to the Overcomers we cannot be otherwise he would not open his treasures to those who would spurn what is already received what I've been saying about the messenger of each age receiving of God some of the originals that's the original truth of Pentecost which is typed in the Old Testament Moses commanded to take up the golden vessel the Mana the prince of Mana in Colorado and place it in a golden vessel behind the veil with sacrificial blood foreign and they whose ears had been opened by the spirit would hear the truth believe it and live it is now we know bread represents the body of the Lord in First Corinthians 10 16 17. this is the cup of blessings which we bless is not the communion of the blood of Christ the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of Christ for being as many as one bread and one body for we are all partakers of that one bread for we all partake of that same one bread Pablo so when the age of Paul began it was Mana for them it was a bread for them it was a certain part of the body for them a new age a new bread would enter it new Believers entered in they're in the Holy place it was changed every Sabbath so there was a certain time for the bread to be changed just like there's a certain period of time for every church and there was bread for that age there was light ipan and bread and Believers for that age the new age would come never lose new believers and bread represents the body of the Lord and it was changed every Sabbath brother Brandon says that that word Sabbath is it's rest and it also represents a church age so then in the Old Testament when they change up the bread every Sabbath it talks about how a new age would enter in Spanish and the new bread would enter it new Believers would enter in and the Believers of the previous Age The Believers that bread of the previous Sabbath they'd enter into them they'd enter into the rest they didn't turn into the Earth and their souls unto the sixth Dimensions they're in their Sabbath in the rest in the Holy Place awaiting that day of Resurrection when they've got now the perfect manner a perfect body to live here on this Earth bread represents the body of the Lord those bodies that we have Spanish they're also typed there with the bread remember praise the Lord then your ID for instance classes there's different types of bodies this human body is the bread the normal manner after a day it would get corrupted yes and this body gets corrupted the theophanese it's called holy bread just like the theophanes are a holy body the Bible says in first Chronicles 9 32. it talks about the children of juab and his brothers they had uh the showbreads and the uh for the propitiation they have the sober to prepare for every Sabbath is at the Feast of the trumpets and seven sabbaths is the seven Church years the seven Church years Church ages now then when every Sabbath represents an age so then every age it had its bread it has its life it had the body of Christ it had its Believers the age ended a new Sabbath introduce a new life and those of the previous age they'd enter into their Sabbath the Sabbath is the rest for the souls so now in the Holy place in the Old Testament there were three Furnitures we're talking about the table about the showbread the golden Candlestick there was another one it was called the altar of the golden altar of incense or it's also called the sensor is that was under the Old Testament but now going back to the Bible so the scripture that we read in the beginning when Paul speaks about that furniture he places the altar of incense not in the Holy place but in the holiest of holy that are under the altar is now that altar is in the Holy place now like we've already spoken on the the showbread representative that represents the body of the Lord represents the light of the messengers how many remember when brother Brandon went to the sixth Dimensions when he was there was a voice that spoke to him in the message the rejected paragraph 152. and then that voice that was speaking from above me I said you know it's written in the Bible that the prophets were gathered with their people and I said yes I remember that in the scriptures he said well this is when you will gather with your people and I said then they'll be real and I can feel them oh see oh yes I said but there are millions there's not that many branhams that voice said they're not branhams them is your Converse of the golden candles in the Holy place he reunited with the bread of his age but there was a little bit more above brother Brandon says and said some of them women there that you think was so beautiful we're better than 90 years old when you led them to the Lord no wonder they're screaming our precious Brothers they all screamed at once if you hadn't have went Nosotros we wouldn't be here in the Holy place where you had to first of all dressed and then qualified to entrance that's why your soul is to enter that place this body isn't but the soul is that's why their souls [Music] it's bread loose and Light I've got so many desires to see him he's somewhere just a little higher when we see the furniture of the Tabernacles we see it like this but for God he sees it like this the altar IO he's just a little higher right up that way he said someday he will come to you see he said you were just sent for a leader and God will come according to what you taught them if they would enter or not we'll go in according to your teachings I said oh I'm just so glad did Paul does he have to stand like this does Peter have to stand like this see yes I said then I preached every word that they preached I never divided from it to one side or to the other where they were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ were they taught of the baptism of the Holy Ghost I did too today whatever they taught I did too yeah and then people screamed and said we all know that is and we know we're going with you someday back to Earth Jesus they said Jesus will come and you'll be judged according to the word that you preached us and then if you're accepted at that time which will be and then you will present us to him as trophies of your ministry and said you will guide us unto him and all together we'll go back to the Earth to live forever so you could see what it was in the Old Testament it was just a shadow of what happens with us today they're placed La significance they're located in this in the meaning so significance that meaning and that importance is located throughout the dimensions our bodies the ones we carry they're in the outer courts they're not allowed to enter into that that's why when we enter into that place we need a new body tomorrow now like we previously spoke upon okay the bread represents the body of the Lord we spoke about how does the brother Branham he types the hidden manner the bread that only the high priests he types it with the show bread the priests because both are special breads not anyone can just eat that bread now something funny I could find it was the measurements the La Mesa of the table of the show bread and then the measurements of the Ark of the Covenant that had the hidden manner both had special bread there's just a little difference between the both of them if you want to open your Bibles to the Book of Exodus chapter 25. verse 8 now Moses was making the Tabernacles he'd make the Tabernacle according to the vision he had in heaven Exodus 25 8 says and let them make a sanctuary that I may dwell among themes according to all that I showed thee after the pattern of the Tabernacle and the pattern of the instruments thereof even so shall you make it now here in verse 10. it talks about the measurements of the Ark of the covenants that was in the Holy place the holiest of holy that had the hidden manner and they shall make an arc of wood which two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof and the Cubit and a half of the bread there of the breath thereof and the Cubit and a half of the height thereof so it says that was two and a half one cube and a half the the longitude era it was two and a half cubitsura and the width is shall be the length thereof and the Cubit the breadth thereof and the Cuba and a half the height thereofs so like you can see in the picture up here both Furnitures CNN La misma Altura they've got the same height once in the Holy place and one in the holiest of Holy Spirit but the difference between the both of them both have both have special bread both are made of wood then covered by gold but the difference between that one and this one in this photo here the difference is just a half just like these two pulpits here the difference between this one and this one it's just this half here these half pieces that we have here special they both have special bread but the length and the width is it's just half bigger brother this is Redemption is in two parts or two halves the holy place it has both parts of the Redemption that you need that's why we still haven't reached a full Redemption yet in this body the soul yes but not this body difference so then the difference between both Furniture Amazon both are the same height but this one it has two halves one half wide Largo and then one half long Maz Grande that's larger than this one now brother Brian says in the message the resurrection of lazaruses and thank you to God that we're still on the Victorious side today because we're in Christ and half has never yet been told the difference between these two Furnitures was just a single half yeah and here brother Branham says has never yet been told it's in its infancy yet but watch it when it comes out of its Great Seal yonders it'll be a time when this whole world is going to receive a shaking like it's never had before in all the days the prophet is telling us that the half that's in the Holy the holiest of holies which was just the Covenant the ark that had the hidden manner one day that manner just look at the back of it there is a pyramid on the other side on the other side there's the Seal of the United States why would the United States recognize under the pyramid the great seals just look above that top stone that topped off the pyramid and you see it standing up with that light shining around it around the sea for what is it up there for it says that's the Great Seal it's in the Cornerstone so then the Cornerstone is the holiest of holy what is the part of the body that we have received let me tell you what part the head is this is the bread that we have received in the sage so therefore because the head is the last part of the body there's no other new message no I must lose there's no more light okay then this message or the Capstone it has the light of the Shekinah Glory there's no other life that's better than that life that's better than this message this message it has the hidden manner that no one could receive in previous ages the revelation of the Seven Seals and the message is this the end uh is this the sign of the answer paragraph 204 this is it first a blasto and I thought it sounded like a sound barrier ever what you call it when the planes cross that sound and the sound comebacks to the Earth then it could have been just a great clap of thunder that sounded like it was the South for me from Mexico but it shook the Earth and when it did I was still looking Westward and way off into eternity I saw a constellation of something coming and it looked like there may have been little dots there could have been no less than five or no more than seven but they were in the shape of a pyramid the Great Seal is the Cornerstone any one of us could see they're on the American bill dollar bill even our money speaks about this message there is hidden manna um brother Brown says in the message a hidden life and listen I will give him of the Hidden manner amen amen I will hide him away and I will give him the hidden things of the world on the outside of the curtain that don't know nothing about it but they don't know about this I will give to him the hidden manner I will give to him the hidden manner with us with this stone with his name on it you see what I mean entering into the adoption or the hidden place with God throughout the time of adoption now the hidden manner is and the Ark has a covering or a lid in English and in English is The Mercy Seat then it's judgment there was that hidden manna is now like I said this is our hidden Mana for today is this is the most special bread in the whole world there's no bread or bread then this bread there's no better message than this message being that this is a part of the bread or the body that was manifested in this age being that bread is also the word of God this bread has to be in the word an apocalypse in Revelation 5 from one to seven he talks about God's Throne now remember the Mana is under God's Throne there where the throne is there was the hidden manna Revelation 5 1 says and I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on on the back side sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with the loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals they're up and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereoning and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and read the book neither to look upon look there on you know and one of the elders unto me said weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof Los Cuatros and behold and lo in the midst of the Throne of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God and sent forth into all the Earth Jesus Christ himself it's that same lamb descending into the Earth now here the lamb has the hidden Manna in his hands will he give us that bread or will it just be for him Revelation 10 1 says and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven cloth with a cloud what is Mana pan bread from Heaven to Los Angeles of the angels that comes to the Earth and now the taste of that bread is honey did you know that span it's bread that was made by angels that was in heaven they'd come down from heaven to the Earth and it speaks now of an Angel covered clothed with a cloud that comes down from heaven here on the Earth and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as the sun and his feet pillars of Fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and is left upon the Earth is and the voice which I heard spoken to me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth this message it has both parts of redemption that you need this message is this book that was open and it was the high priest that he himself as an angel descended upon the Earth with the hidden Manna in his hands and Mana must be eaten that's why in verse 9 is the hidden manner never lose its honey we're at the head notice that it would be bitter to thy belly brother Brandon says the hidden Madness in the time of adoption and adoption is it's the most bitter trial that one goes through is brother Brandon went through a very bitter trial during the time of his adoption when this part of the body was manifested issue because the honey will help with the bitterness some months ago I got sick of my throat or my nose something like that my mother a home remedy yesterday that home remedy was vinegar apple cider vinegar something so horrible and so disgusting I looked like a little kid my mother yelling at me Emmanuel just drink it drink it no no no no I don't want to don't make me do it don't make me drink it Mom but that vinegar was something good for me but since it's bitter we don't want it the adoption it's bitter but God also has to give you honey for you to go through that bitterness and brother branham's honey that's for the bitterness of his stomach issues and at the last part of his life for that bitterness verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life I am the bread of life and when this bread is this part of the body photography it was photographed it was published in a a newspaper life that's a magazine called life I have a picture can you show it to me this is I am the bread of life this bread is this part of the body is it's life for you is this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man that eateth thereof will not die Jose I am the living bread which come down from heaven and if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I give for the life of the world brother says now to end the message what does it take to make a Christian Life paragraph 43. We live because something died if you don't live today if you don't eat dead substances our natural life is only by dead substances fine if we eat bread the wheat died something has to die so we physically can live again because we are the substance of the earth and that's the way we're taking the substance to Keep Us Alive something had to die so that you could live eternally let's stand remember this message the best that God has given there's no other message there's no better bread there's no better light if you've got some bitterness there's honey in this message let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you this morning we know that we're in the last age it's a bitter age it's the age that crucified and in your crucifixion you were given vinegar something so bitter in your last moments of life but then when you resurrected you asked for food you were given honey to those that need it help every one of us we're in your hands we need bread to live our soul needs of this
