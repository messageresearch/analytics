[34:22] to the of the land which i swear on to
[34:25] their fathers to give them

[34:35] only be thou strong and very courageous
[34:38] that thou mayest observe to do according
[34:40] to all the law
[34:42] which moses my servant commanded thee
[34:45] turn not it from the right hand or to
[34:47] the left that thou mayest prosper
[34:49] with sever thou goest
[34:59] yes
[35:04] this book of the law shall now the part
[35:06] of the out of thy mouth but thou shalt
[35:08] meditate therein day and night and thou
[35:10] mayest observe to do according to all
[35:12] that is written therein for then thou
[35:15] shall make thy way prosperous and then
[35:17] thou shall have good success
[35:43] father lord this evening we come
[35:45] close on to your throne of grace and
[35:47] mercy
[35:52] lord we come with confidence lord
[35:54] because of the sacrifice your son made
[35:57] on the cross
[36:02] lord may you help us as we're gathered
[36:04] here in this place
[36:09] you relax as lord
[36:24] you help the young people and everyone
[36:26] that's here today
[36:30] with this message lord be
[36:32] prosperous for our lives
[36:37] may be a benefit to us lord
[36:50] this evening we're going to continue on
[36:51] the message and
[37:07] [Music]
[37:16] thank the lord that he has allowed us to
[37:17] speak on a friday to bring this to the
[37:19] young people
[37:25] this is something of key importance to
[37:28] young people's lives
[37:33] and i think that's a very interesting
[37:35] word
[37:41] um we as we read the scripture here in
[37:43] joshua
[37:47] and if we read it verse by verse once
[37:48] again
[38:01] but let's just read it just let's break
[38:04] it down and let's see what the scripture
[38:06] says
[38:10] and verse says
[38:12] excuse me verse verse six and then
[38:15] says it says be strong
[38:18] of good courage
[38:21] right off the bat you tell us to be
[38:22] strong and have good courage
[38:27] so when something presents to us in our
[38:30] life
[38:34] now i know there's young people here
[38:35] that are in school and there's some that
[38:37] are not in school
[38:41] but the scripture is telling us in
[38:43] spanish i like what it says it says make
[38:45] the effort
[38:49] the first that's the first word in
[38:51] spanish
[38:54] be strong
[38:55] make make an effort
[39:22] now
[39:23] like i said take what i'm saying in the
[39:24] natural but also take the spiritual
[39:41] and thou mayest observe to do according
[39:43] to all the law
[39:47] so he's telling us make sure that you
[39:49] you fulfill
[39:51] the scriptures the law that what moses
[39:53] wrote down and tons
[40:08] now you have the word right there what
[40:10] moses wrote
[40:13] but now he's telling you don't turn to
[40:15] the right hand it is
[40:19] or to the left mia
[40:21] you see there's a balance a unequilibro
[40:24] so so people you believe that people
[40:27] should go to school
[40:30] now we're going to see where brother
[40:32] branham says
[40:32] he look at this
[40:34] no i'm not the ones who were here last
[40:35] week we we spoke on
[40:44] and we're going to review and we're
[40:45] going to speak on other things
[40:48] now you have the word you got the bible
[40:50] right here placed before you arrested
[40:56] god is telling you fulfill everything
[40:58] that's in that book
[41:03] but don't go to the right hand
[41:07] and don't go to the left
[41:10] don't go too much to over here
[41:14] too much over here
[41:16] but stay centered
[41:24] now people might say well brother i see
[41:26] that young man do this
[41:31] i see that minister do that
[41:35] let them do what they do
[41:38] but don't do what they do
[41:41] remember what jesus told his disciples
[41:45] said should we listen to them that are
[41:48] speaking the word
[41:53] listen to them
[41:56] and say what they do
[42:00] but don't do what
[42:07] so if you see someone do something
[42:09] that's outside of the word
[42:17] [Music]
[42:42] is
[42:52] [Music]
[42:56] he might justify his excuses
[43:01] don't follow that minister because he
[43:03] did something that's outside of the word
[43:08] and he tries to justify his excuse
[43:24] do
[43:26] now verse 8
[43:28] but this book
[43:29] is
[43:30] what book que libro the bible
[43:33] but this book of the law shall not
[43:36] depart out of thy mouth nunca
[43:42] we're talking here about the the keys of
[43:44] success right here
[43:48] right here just these three script these
[43:49] three verses right here
[43:52] you don't have to go to seminars and
[43:54] listen to these successful speakers
[44:01] all you got to do is just read that
[44:02] scripture
[44:05] this book is
[44:35] depart out of your mouth
[44:39] now
[44:40] we should never stop speaking about it
[44:44] now now it also says but thou shalt
[44:47] meditate
[45:18] observe to do according to all that is
[45:21] written therein
[45:22] guards
[45:26] speak of the word hable de la palabra
[45:28] think on the word
[45:31] so you can try to do everything that's
[45:34] in that word
[45:38] for then
[45:40] says thou shall make thy way prosperous
[45:44] prosper
[46:10] and thou shalt make thy way prosperous
[46:26] is
[46:29] i'm speaking in english because it's a
[46:30] youth service
[46:33] and i want the youth to listen first
[46:37] in english it says and thou shall have
[46:39] good success
[46:46] last week the prophet t
[46:48] talked to us and told us there's two
[46:50] types of success
[46:52] those definitely
[46:54] there's the success of the world el cito
[46:56] del mundo there's a right success
[47:00] a success that comes from god
[47:04] and here yes the scripture is telling us
[47:23] now i wrote some little things here
[47:28] by coincidence that's seven points
[47:34] that just came to my mind
[48:04] success
[48:17] is
[48:25] if anyone wants to look to the future
[48:28] and go to school
[48:32] there's absolutely nothing wrong with
[48:34] that
[48:36] absolutely
[48:37] going to get a
[48:38] college degree
[48:41] universitarian
[48:43] masters and doctorates
[48:46] just
[48:49] that education doesn't get in the way of
[48:51] god's word
[48:56] amen but you should go look first look
[48:59] for success in school
[49:10] miniatures back in the 70s in the 80s
[49:13] and the 90s los ministros
[49:55] there's some people that go to school
[49:57] for three to four five six eight years
[50:03] and then they don't even use their
[50:05] degrees
[50:08] right
[50:09] i've known people that are barbers
[50:12] personas
[50:13] and they went to school to become
[50:15] whatever they wanted to be foreign
[50:21] and they didn't make enough money with
[50:23] that degree in
[50:49] and study something you're not going to
[50:51] work on convience
[51:00] is to look for something that you will
[51:02] be financially stable is
[51:21] make sure that you get a degree and you
[51:23] that degree is successful
[51:29] now success and finances
[51:32] finances that's a really interesting
[51:34] subject
[51:47] he knows how this works he knows how
[51:49] that works
[51:52] he knows finances
[51:55] if anyone has any struggle with that
[51:58] [Music]
[52:00] we have a pastor by god's grace that god
[52:02] has given him the capacity to learn
[52:04] those stuff
[52:08] to know how to manage our finances
[52:13] finances last week i said i believe with
[52:16] all of my heart
[52:38] there should be enough funds in our
[52:40] account
[52:44] and how does all of that come into play
[52:50] you put god first
[52:55] put god's word first
[53:30] where
[53:32] now mommy and daddy can't pay for your
[53:34] bills anymore
[53:37] now you have to find a job
[53:40] and you have
[53:54] but i believe that we should have
[53:56] success in our finances
[54:01] now success in choosing a spouse
[54:06] now that is a success
[54:15] [Music]
[54:35] and you meditate on god's word
[54:39] and choosing a spouse
[54:42] when you have you when you choose the
[54:43] right spouse
[54:47] you will prosper us
[54:50] a
[54:51] success in raising a family
[54:54] in
[54:54] a famiglia man come to a point where a
[54:57] young man is
[54:59] becomes independent
[55:04] you're
[55:04] independent you have to now your mom
[55:07] doesn't have to take you to the to the
[55:09] shower to shower you alright
[55:13] you're independent
[55:16] we're going to come to a time where now
[55:17] it's going to come to a stage of
[55:19] dependence
[55:22] where some are going to depend on you
[55:24] personally
[55:26] your wife is going to depend on you
[55:28] and then the kids are going to depend on
[55:30] you
[55:31] is dependent on this oh you got to have
[55:32] a good
[55:48] and you have to lead him to the feet of
[55:49] the lord
[55:52] you can't lead someone to the feet of
[55:54] the lord if you're not surrendered to
[55:56] the future
[55:59] um
[56:14] something you heard about for so many
[56:16] years
[56:19] something that you've heard about that
[56:21] you've heard about
[56:24] but truly that's a success in receiving
[56:27] the holy ghost
[56:42] when you pray on something
[56:45] and god answers
[56:47] contestants and it makes you feel good
[56:49] your faith just goes up
[56:52] and you you say man i'm doing something
[56:55] right you know this is
[57:11] i hope you love the lord okay
[57:14] um let's read a quote we read this quote
[57:17] last week
[57:23] i believe all of us have a thirst for
[57:24] something
[57:27] but the ram says this element of branham
[57:29] these thirsts are just natural esta
[57:32] solamente is natural they're natural for
[57:34] the christians
[57:36] cristiano they're natural for the human
[57:38] being
[57:40] they're normal
[57:44] for the people
[57:46] and for even us christians
[57:48] christians there's also a thirst
[57:52] for success for alexito there's a thirst
[57:55] for that ayuna
[57:56] so many people today how we school for
[57:59] this thirst
[58:03] we just noticed they started the
[58:04] university up no centenary
[58:08] and we go down there and people spend
[58:10] thousands of dollars to send their
[58:12] children to school
[58:18] and to universities and colleges and so
[58:21] forth to get an education
[58:25] notice what happens
[58:28] to be successful what i call it
[58:34] in la vida but now i have nothing
[58:36] against that
[58:39] contradiction has nothing against
[58:41] schools in education
[58:46] education says that's all right this is
[58:51] i want you to notice i want you to
[58:52] listen very closely what brother brown
[58:54] says
[58:57] but to me
[59:00] who's that you're paula branham
[59:03] you can get all the schooling in the
[59:05] world
[59:08] and you still haven't found the right
[59:11] success
[59:15] okay
[59:23] because that will just temporarily make
[59:27] things a little easier for you here
[59:29] porque esto solamente
[59:41] because that's going to make your life a
[59:43] little easier here on earth
[59:57] that's not the right success to me but
[1:00:12] you leave all the diploma
[1:00:14] is the diploma and they've all that
[1:00:16] a-s-u and u of a they call the a-s-u e-u
[1:00:20] of a leave all that community college
[1:00:22] behind you damien de cal de la
[1:00:23] universidad communitaria doctorate that
[1:00:26] master degree
[1:00:31] and this entire economy that we have
[1:00:36] because that's not the right type of
[1:00:37] success
[1:00:40] correct there's a right success and
[1:00:42] there's a success of the world
[1:00:46] that's not the right success yes
[1:00:49] they think they've done it all once they
[1:00:51] have a degree
[1:00:53] today
[1:01:06] last week we spoke about a young man
[1:01:36] i like this right here
[1:01:39] that jesus christ
[1:01:41] he didn't point to himself
[1:01:44] he says i'm not good el dico no bueno he
[1:01:47] is good el es bueno so us we should
[1:01:50] never point to ourselves
[1:01:57] young man
[1:01:59] said the scriptures tell us that jesus
[1:02:01] loved him
[1:02:04] he was
[1:02:15] he rejected jesus christ
[1:02:18] he rejected
[1:02:21] and
[1:02:22] a lot of people think well maybe that
[1:02:24] young man after rejecting the word
[1:02:29] pretty sure he lost all of his business
[1:02:34] i'm pretty sure him rejecting jesus
[1:02:35] christ he went bankrupt
[1:02:41] he increased el almento if he had two
[1:02:44] businesses
[1:02:46] now he had
[1:02:59] but he made his investment
[1:03:12] where there was the old rich ruler
[1:03:24] he was very happy he said i prospered i
[1:03:26] rejected that man christ and look at my
[1:03:28] business
[1:03:42] that young man that old man said all
[1:03:44] right so alright
[1:03:49] rejoice
[1:03:51] he went to bed else
[1:03:54] then the angel said all right
[1:04:10] it's time
[1:04:23] and the scripture tells us
[1:04:39] success
[1:04:42] the success of receiving god
[1:04:45] the success of receiving his word
[1:04:49] because he thought that that was a bad
[1:04:52] business plan
[1:05:06] speaks to us about a hell that exists
[1:05:13] and the young man said abraham yelhoven
[1:05:15] dico abram he said father abraham
[1:05:18] and abraham says
[1:05:28] and he says can you please come over
[1:05:29] here and send lazarus and dip his finger
[1:05:32] on my tongue with water
[1:05:48] abyss that we can't cross over there
[1:05:53] he said well can you send someone from
[1:05:55] here and and preach to my brothers that
[1:05:57] i have back home
[1:06:02] because i'm
[1:06:16] um
[1:06:30] they're going to
[1:06:38] [Music]
[1:06:43] listen to the prophets
[1:07:12] [Music]
[1:07:26] people still
[1:07:40] who have not seen quinoa
[1:07:42] and yet they believe
[1:07:45] you're making an investment
[1:07:48] [Music]
[1:07:50] something you have not seen
[1:07:54] but it's rock solid foundation the word
[1:07:57] of god
[1:08:00] that's not going to break
[1:08:02] it's the word of god
[1:08:04] there's someone here sitting today
[1:08:08] it doesn't believe there's
[1:08:20] accept the lord jesus christ
[1:08:30] and they rose early in the morning and
[1:08:32] went forth into the wilderness of
[1:08:33] tequila
[1:08:50] believe in the lord your god
[1:08:56] believe in the lord your god
[1:09:01] so ye shall be established yes
[1:09:04] now
[1:09:05] in spanish and english is a different
[1:09:06] word
[1:09:09] spanish is talking about being safe for
[1:09:10] sure in english
[1:09:14] but in english but in english it says to
[1:09:17] be established
[1:09:45] his name is william miriam branham el
[1:09:47] hombre del provetas william branham
[1:09:51] believe your profit cred a professor
[1:09:54] brother branham has given us
[1:09:56] everything
[1:09:59] you want to know how to have success in
[1:10:01] your finances
[1:10:03] finances go to what brother madam says
[1:10:06] and if you can't understand that
[1:10:10] i i understand it's english and it might
[1:10:12] not
[1:10:13] break it down so easily
[1:10:29] creed
[1:10:30] and you shall prosper israel
[1:10:33] where prophetess who is our prophet
[1:10:37] william mary and branham is william
[1:10:39] branham should it be a shame who your
[1:10:40] prophet is
[1:10:55] now again it's the accomplishment of an
[1:10:57] aim or a purpose this is
[1:11:01] now what's your name
[1:11:04] what's your purpose
[1:11:06] what do you want to do
[1:11:09] now there has to be a motive
[1:11:12] there has to be an objective
[1:11:15] if you want to go to school there has to
[1:11:16] be a motive and there has to be an
[1:11:17] objective
[1:11:21] in order for you when you get those two
[1:11:23] down
[1:11:31] and you must test your motive and
[1:11:34] objectives
[1:11:37] first prime first then find the will of
[1:11:40] god
[1:11:43] and then find your objective
[1:11:46] and then test your motive and see if
[1:11:48] your motive is right
[1:11:52] then as jesus said in mark 11 24.
[1:11:56] if you say to this mountain be moved
[1:12:00] and don't doubt in your heart
[1:12:02] but as long as you've got doubt in the
[1:12:05] heart
[1:12:07] whether it's the will of god
[1:12:09] excuse me whether it's the will of god
[1:12:11] or your motive or objective is wrong
[1:12:17] how was it going to move
[1:12:20] but when you got uh wait but when you
[1:12:22] when you know that your motive is right
[1:12:27] and it's the will of god
[1:12:30] and your objective is right
[1:12:33] it's got to move
[1:12:56] [Music]
[1:13:10] just with his father and his friends
[1:13:12] coming down from babylon
[1:13:16] they
[1:13:29] no doubt he prayed through to the until
[1:13:32] he struck the hand of god
[1:13:39] you heard that key a little key right
[1:13:41] there of prayer
[1:13:44] stay praying until you you touch the
[1:13:47] hand of god
[1:13:52] how did he do it
[1:13:54] by faith
[1:13:56] perhaps he thought like this quesas el
[1:14:11] somewhere in the land of heathens where
[1:14:12] he was start journeying
[1:14:18] he touched the henna
[1:14:21] and in there god gave him a revelation
[1:14:23] that there was a city whose builder
[1:14:25] maker was god
[1:15:51] to take up space
[1:15:55] i'm not just another person here on
[1:15:57] earth
[1:15:59] i got a purpose here in life
[1:16:03] you have a purpose here in life
[1:16:18] and as i said last night go beyond the
[1:16:20] sound barriers
[1:16:23] then you have a purpose in line
[1:16:28] you have a purpose and belonging to the
[1:16:30] church
[1:16:59] another person that sits on the pew
[1:17:02] person
[1:17:03] no when you find yourself with god face
[1:17:05] to face
[1:17:08] you're not a member of jericho
[1:17:10] tabernacles
[1:18:35] amen
[1:18:37] we know that god is honest
[1:18:52] now the definition of purpose
[1:18:55] definition of proposition is the reason
[1:18:57] for which something is done
[1:19:01] created
[1:19:04] or the reason why something exists
[1:19:17] [Music]
[1:19:20] there's a reason why you exist exist
[1:19:24] you're just not another
[1:19:26] body here on earth
[1:19:30] i made you with a purpose
[1:19:33] if he made you he made some with you
[1:19:35] with the gift of singing
[1:19:44] for that purpose

[1:19:48] instrument

[1:20:35] a purpose

[1:20:44] just keep saying amen to god's word
[1:20:48] raise your hand
[1:20:50] worship the lord
[1:20:52] because all of us
[1:20:55] regardless of our gifts or talents
[1:20:57] independence

[1:21:15] us
[1:21:20] to help the people or get in the spirit
[1:21:21] especially
[1:22:03] out of a million excuses
[1:22:07] out of all that mud they thought
[1:22:30] when god speaks to a man he gives him
[1:22:32] ambition
[1:22:34] when he god speaks to a man he gives
[1:22:36] them faith to do it
[1:22:40] to accomplish it
[1:22:43] achieve what his purpose in life is
[1:22:47] what god called them to do
[1:22:51] he's called us to be the church of god
[1:22:56] says amen
[1:22:58] amen
[1:22:59] says let's just make our purpose in life
[1:23:01] to see
[1:23:02] that we are the church of god it is
