[40:37] would i do sister
[40:41] you know the bible says repent and
[40:42] receive the holy ghost but what do i do
[40:49] you know we believe that god sent a
[40:50] prophet
[40:52] and that prophet is a prophet you know
[40:54] they didn't just preach the word
[40:57] but this prophet whether you like it or
[40:59] not
[41:01] he taught us how to control or how to
[41:03] manage our finances
[41:08] the prophet william branham taught us
[41:10] how to manage our money ciel prophet
[41:12] william brando como administration
[41:15] i thought he came to open up the seals
[41:17] and everything else and all this stuff
[41:22] yes but he taught us even how to manage
[41:23] your finances
[41:28] he taught us how a young man a young
[41:30] lady should court the
[41:31] common
[41:38] even taught the young man how to
[41:39] approach the young ladies
[41:46] i don't believe in that brother no
[41:47] hermanos
[41:49] she likes me she likes me
[41:53] he taught us how to approach a young
[41:55] lady
[41:59] go to the message
[42:14] through dry places so he can rest and
[42:17] findeth none and
[42:20] repose
[42:22] what do we find here
[42:24] what we find we find an individual
[42:28] a scripture
[42:39] we find you yourself put yourself there
[42:45] and this is when the uncle and spirit is
[42:47] not cast out of the man
[42:52] uh we know rebuked you know you know not
[42:54] that represent
[43:10] you know once
[43:18] because no one teaches the little child
[43:24] this little one this is this is how you
[43:26] lie
[43:26] oh yeah me mijo asi when your mom asks
[43:29] this you tell her the opposite
[43:33] once the little child is there
[43:36] you put some some music on
[43:43] and we're saying oh how cute and how
[43:45] adorable that little baby is oh look how
[43:47] cute it is
[43:50] but it's the unclean spirit
[43:55] the baby is not able to understand us to
[43:58] tell the baby look move you know jiggle
[44:00] yourself
[44:04] it's the spirit that's inside of him
[44:06] that makes a move
[44:09] and as we grow up you know we start
[44:11] doing wrong things
[44:15] so here we find with the christian right
[44:17] here for verse 43 it is
[44:30] that spirit that made you dance it made
[44:32] you smoke it made you lie your spirit
[44:59] another christian that has his battery
[45:00] load uh
[45:15] a christian around here at jericho
[45:17] tabernacles
[45:22] i'll return to my house
[45:26] he claims it that's my house
[45:29] when luis aguilar was born
[45:39] he couldn't find
[45:41] a christian and jericho tabernacle with
[45:43] his battery loan no pudo in control
[46:10] he said and when i came out he he find
[46:12] it when he comes in
[46:14] he finds it empty
[46:19] and garnish
[46:20] you know sometimes we start cleaning up
[46:22] our act we started stopping the things
[46:25] that we used to do
[46:39] more wicked than himself malignant
[46:43] you know maybe this little spirit that
[46:44] just made you just dance just made you
[46:46] lie every once in a while
[46:47] [Music]
[46:51] but he's going to find seven other
[46:53] fellows
[47:03] and the last state of the man is worse
[47:04] than the first post
[47:11] we find a young man a young lady a
[47:13] christian
[47:16] christian step to the lord chaos
[47:18] repented
[47:20] he got baptized
[47:21] and now
[47:23] now they they feel this fire that's
[47:25] burning inside their heart all right you
[47:26] seen this
[47:28] no no one's going to stop me i i feel
[47:30] good
[47:34] and the spirit is looking around trying
[47:36] to find another home
[47:39] you see we didn't cast out the spirits
[47:43] once the spirit noticed that you weren't
[47:45] obeying him
[47:49] the spirit kept telling you do this and
[47:51] do that and do the other el espirito
[47:54] yes
[47:55] you didn't obey you nobody says the
[47:57] spirit said with this guy listening to
[47:58] me anymore i'm going to leave it
[48:03] i'm going to find someone that's going
[48:04] to obey me don't make me feel at home
[48:10] and since you
[48:11] didn't do what the prophet said what the
[48:13] scripture said
[48:17] he comes back inside of you el buelve
[48:20] and if you're not if you're not
[48:23] uh ready
[48:25] you're gonna start doing things that
[48:26] you'd even do back then
[48:31] now you start doing other things in
[48:33] pieces
[48:34] now you start doing that in business and
[48:36] doing the other yes
[48:38] because the scripture has to be
[48:41] fulfilled
[48:43] brother what do you mean the scripture
[48:44] has to be fulfilled
[49:10] and bring other friends with him
[49:13] and you're going to start doing things
[49:14] that you didn't do back then
[49:19] a very beautiful picture jesus said
[49:23] when the unclean spirit has gone out of
[49:25] a man
[49:25] [Music]
[49:27] did you notice he never said
[49:31] when he's cast out of a man
[49:35] but when he goes out by his own will
[49:38] and the unclean spirit has gone out of a
[49:40] man
[49:42] and returns back to this man and finds
[49:44] that his house was that he lived was has
[49:46] been swept
[49:54] then he goes and gets seven other devils
[50:16] [Music]
[50:24] now
[50:36] but you see he just found it swept and
[50:38] garnished
[50:52] says don't stop for nothing
[50:57] don't just stop and listen to the devil
[51:01] always stay busy
[51:03] maintain yourself doing something for
[51:05] the lord
[51:34] another
[51:39] and then you find yourself oh what am i
[51:40] doing uh you already you are already
[51:42] just you already welcomed him back in
[51:44] illoga
[52:02] they see the hour approaching
[52:05] they know something is fixing to happen
[52:09] what do they do
[52:11] there's a lot of people
[52:13] not just christians
[52:15] but people who are not christians
[52:28] something something's going to happen
[52:58] brother and sister
[53:12] what does he mean
[53:22] what do they think what what were they
[53:24] thinking
[53:25] they thought that jesus was with him
[53:28] jesus
[53:30] and they went on in their way
[53:33] they went how long did they terry what
[53:35] three days
[53:37] what does it matter
[53:38] if you're not with jesus
[53:54] see
[54:03] he says your life shows whether he's
[54:05] occupied here or not
[54:21] the scripture told us in saying
[54:35] in the city of jerusalem
[54:50] receive the gift of the holy ghost
[54:53] notice what jesus told told him to do
[54:56] jesus
[54:58] he says go and tarry in the city of
[55:00] jerusalem
[55:03] now terry doesn't mean to pray
[55:32] occupy doing something for the lord
[55:37] we shouldn't just stay idle
[55:40] you know that this i'm comfortable with
[55:42] just where i'm at right now
[55:46] as brother brown
[55:53] and then come back and tell me if you
[55:55] still feel the same way
[55:59] you feel that burning inside your heart
[56:02] you've got to maintain yourself busy at
[56:04] all times
[56:07] now matthew 26 36
[56:10] 30
[56:11] says then cometh jesus with him onto a
[56:14] place called gethsemane
[56:19] here we find the lord jesus christ
[56:23] before the crucifixion before he he got
[56:25] turned in
[56:26] crucifixion
[56:28] he
[56:35] he wanted to pray and he wanted to tell
[56:36] god you know what can you can you can
[56:38] you find another solution
[56:42] is
[56:45] because even though he was the son of
[56:47] god or he was god
[56:51] he still felt it in his flesh
[56:53] [Music]
[56:56] sweating
[57:12] he took with him peter and two of the
[57:14] sons of zebedee
[57:15] began to be powerful and very heavy
[57:28] and he began to be very very sad and he
[57:31] got you know the sorrowful just got
[57:33] really heavy on him
[57:52] and watch
[58:18] amen are you following me once again and
[58:21] he says and he went a little further
[58:25] he went a little further
[58:27] i hope you're seeing it the way i'm
[58:28] seeing it
[58:32] and he fell on his face
[59:00] if you can do something here
[59:10] that's something that we should always
[59:11] pray that way
[59:14] lord not what i want and your nose look
[59:16] you
[59:19] [Music]
[59:31] for the moon and the sun to change
[59:32] places but lord can you do it
[59:38] it's not what i want
[59:40] but it's what you want
[59:42] i remember just a little just a little
[59:44] in in parentheses uh in parentheses i
[59:47] remember sister sharon guzman shared his
[59:48] testimony with us
[59:53] he said that they broke into a couple
[59:54] years ago they broke into her house
[1:00:12] about a
[1:00:54] and
[1:01:01] it's the same thing with the lord jesus
[1:01:02] christ
[1:01:04] and he says we were stolen
[1:01:07] we were stolen property of the lord
[1:01:08] jesus christ
[1:01:13] he didn't have to pay for us
[1:01:16] he didn't have to come back and pay for
[1:01:17] us
[1:01:19] he paid the price
[1:01:36] he still had to pay a price
[1:01:40] the same thing with the lord jesus
[1:01:42] christ
[1:01:47] and he came in
[1:01:49] he hadn't he didn't have to pay for
[1:01:50] anything hello he created us
[1:01:53] but still he paid the price
[1:01:57] amen
[1:01:58] 84 verse 4
[1:02:02] onto his disciples
[1:02:19] sometimes we find our our christian uh
[1:02:22] walk like that just sleeping
[1:02:25] christian
[1:02:27] imagine the master the lord jesus christ
[1:02:30] the rabbi coming on to these disciples
[1:02:32] imagine
[1:02:44] you couldn't watch with me one hour
[1:03:28] so what does he say kevin says what does
[1:03:29] he say what what what's what's the
[1:03:31] remedy for that question remember watch
[1:03:34] and pray
[1:03:35] watch him pray bella brother brian says
[1:03:37] this this is now yeah you'll find it
[1:03:42] i didn't want to put it up there
[1:03:44] because when we pray
[1:03:46] we're supposed to pray with our eyes
[1:03:47] closed both eyes closed
[1:03:50] and there's a reason for that yeah
[1:03:52] but i don't want the little kids to run
[1:03:54] out you know
[1:03:56] what brother louise said that brother
[1:03:58] branham said
[1:04:01] pray with one eye
[1:04:03] when i closed and one eye opens
[1:04:05] [Music]
[1:04:07] that's what brother branham said
[1:04:08] watch and pray
[1:04:10] when i
[1:04:24] who's crying and what's going on you
[1:04:26] know nope
[1:04:29] you man are you do you love the lord
[1:04:32] okay that's good
[1:04:34] now notice this was before the
[1:04:36] crucifixion
[1:04:38] but then peter you know a very you know
[1:04:42] notable character in the bible
[1:04:46] now let's go to saint luke 22 31.
[1:04:52] you know
[1:04:56] saying luke
[1:04:58] 22 31
[1:05:03] this is right before around the same
[1:05:05] time
[1:05:06] about the when he got turned in
[1:05:09] uh
[1:05:12] he said the lord said simon simon behold
[1:05:16] satan had the desire to have you that he
[1:05:19] may sift you as wheat
[1:05:34] the holy ghost wasn't given out yet
[1:05:39] but you know there's peter you know
[1:05:41] thinking he
[1:05:42] man i i i can do all things
[1:05:47] and then the master turns right next to
[1:05:49] him
[1:05:51] and he says simon
[1:05:53] simon the satan has a desire to sift you
[1:05:56] as wheat.
[1:06:01] the prophet tells us the devil or the
[1:06:02] spirit's can't move or do anything
[1:06:04] without permission
[1:06:10] everything everything that moves
[1:06:13] because god permitted it
[1:06:17] and he says satan went up to went up to
[1:06:19] him
[1:06:21] he said let me have peter
[1:06:24] pedro i i want to shake him up a little
[1:06:26] bit
[1:06:28] and jesus didn't say it
[1:06:37] i want to get these these people who
[1:06:39] just recently got baptized
[1:06:43] i want to get sister violet
[1:06:59] you know
[1:07:00] you know god god is good you know
[1:07:03] you know and i believe that one you
[1:07:05] might criticize me for this
[1:07:09] but you know that you know the devil el
[1:07:11] diablo he's a real good adversary
[1:07:16] but i like i like how we say it in
[1:07:18] spanish
[1:07:21] you know
[1:07:21] we in english we call it the dolly uh
[1:07:25] in english
[1:07:32] you kind of carry you you want to carry
[1:07:33] the puppet you
[1:07:34] put it right on the dolly instrument
[1:07:54] eli come over here and then let's carry
[1:07:56] this
[1:07:59] no this dolly this this diablo
[1:08:03] so so i can carry the weight
[1:08:06] of support i don't i don't break my back
[1:08:49] and i hope the lord reopens your eyes
[1:09:46] we can't do anything
[1:09:57] amen i'm in now notice just follow me
[1:10:02] and my schofield bible and my
[1:10:03] concordance is here
[1:10:07] when it says wheat
[1:10:10] it says here it says peter
[1:10:12] was the wheat
[1:10:13] pedro er altrigo
[1:10:55] the self-confidence is the shock
[1:11:00] so so here's the devil
[1:11:02] diabetes he starts shaking up peter
[1:11:04] empiesa
[1:11:06] but he's not shaking up peter but i know
[1:11:08] sakura peppers get him out of the road
[1:11:52] jesus jesus christ i'm praying for you
[1:11:56] i'm praying for you
[1:11:58] that your faith will not fail but
[1:12:01] no faith you don't get dismayed but i
[1:12:03] can know this there it is i'm i'm
[1:12:05] praying for you
[1:12:22] he wasn't converted yet
[1:12:25] when you're converted
[1:12:27] straighten your brethren confirmation
[1:12:29] help your brethren
[1:12:31] in the face establish
[1:12:33] and he said unto him
[1:12:34] lord notice peter there he is right
[1:12:37] after right after getting baptized
[1:12:40] with the fire of the holy ghost
[1:12:44] i'm ready to go with thee
[1:12:47] of prison
[1:13:42] where i can feel good around him this
[1:13:58] [Music]
[1:14:11] you don't feel disgusting you don't feel
[1:14:13] like you've betrayed him
[1:14:17] i want to get to a place where i can
[1:14:19] feel good around him
[1:14:23] see i'm justified
[1:14:26] he says now i come to the stage here
[1:14:29] where i can talk to him
[1:14:34] because i'm still ashamed of myself of
[1:14:36] myself
[1:14:39] he's talking about the stage of
[1:14:40] justification
[1:16:17] i can have peace
[1:16:42] [Music]
[1:16:44] but i'm still ashamed of myself
[1:16:55] but i want i want him to cleanse me
[1:16:59] all of those things
[1:17:01] so i can really walk up to him
[1:17:06] talk to him
[1:17:09] when you're at peace with someone
[1:17:12] nothing against that individual
[1:17:41] that's how i want to walk up to him
[1:17:46] i want to walk home i want to walk up to
[1:17:48] him that way
