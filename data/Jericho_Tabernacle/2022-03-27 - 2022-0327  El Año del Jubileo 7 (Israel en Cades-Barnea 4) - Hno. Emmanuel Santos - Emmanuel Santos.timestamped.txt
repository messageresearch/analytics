[57:35] and when we departed from horeb we went
[57:37] through all the great and terrible
[57:38] wilderness which he saw by the way of
[57:41] the mountain of the amorites as the lord
[57:43] our god commanded us and we came to
[57:45] kadesh barnea
[57:47] entonces
[57:53] and i said unto you ye are come unto the
[57:55] mountain of the amorites which the lord
[57:58] our god hath given to us
[58:09] behold the lord thy god hath set the
[58:11] land before thee and go up and possess
[58:13] it as the lord god of thy fathers has
[58:16] said unto thee fear not neither be
[58:18] discouraged
[58:35] previously last time i spoke on sunday

[58:43] the year of jubilee prologue
[58:45] but then i started to study again
[58:48] one of your
[59:03] the lord gave it to me a few months ago
[59:06] and in these last days
[59:10] i believe i've received confirmation
[59:12] after confirmation
[59:15] that this is the message for today
[59:19] [Music]
[59:41] that's why last time the previous times
[59:43] i spoke on those themes

[1:01:26] based upon the decision they make
[1:01:31] in regards to the promise god gave them
[1:01:32] for their dates
[1:01:34] but the brandon also says
[1:01:49] because jesus the great king and judge
[1:01:54] the one that's seated at his throne
[1:01:55] ayanel calvario there at calvary
[1:02:00] he received the judgment of all of our

[1:04:54] fulfill that part los micioneros
[1:04:56] apartments the missionaries fulfilled
[1:04:57] that part
[1:05:00] of philadelphia and that was during the
[1:05:01] time of philadelphia
[1:05:04] but once lauda began
[1:05:06] a
[1:05:18] and the open door has to do with that
[1:05:20] philadelphia
[1:05:34] the second part of the open door is
[1:05:35] fulfilled
[1:05:38] the second part of the gospel the
[1:05:40] predication the preaching in
[1:05:42] philadelphia in philadelphia
[1:05:45] the power of the gospel
[1:05:47] when lawrence began our
[1:06:16] if you study the message of philadelphia
[1:06:19] brother branham touches on every single
[1:06:21] part
[1:06:22] of
[1:06:23] jesus and the open door is jesus
[1:06:26] that's why this age
[1:06:29] is not the open door loud
[1:06:39] because first of all they're closing the
[1:06:40] doors to their heart it is
[1:06:44] and that spirit's going to materialize
[1:06:48] in the literal churches
[1:06:51] but we're not allowed to say that
[1:06:54] just like the israelites
[1:06:56] they were in egypt
[1:06:58] but one
[1:07:24] to the revelation of jesus christ
[1:07:26] to the rapture
[1:07:40] and with the jubilee vamos alert
[1:07:43] we're going to read isaiah 51
[1:07:45] 61
[1:07:49] this is the prophecy of the jubilee
[1:07:52] spirit
[1:08:03] the spirit of the lord god is upon me
[1:08:04] because the lord hath anointed me to
[1:08:06] preach good tidings unto the meek
[1:08:23] he anointed me to preach good tidings
[1:08:26] of philadelphia and how did philadelphia
[1:08:28] begin
[1:08:30] with the preaching of the gospels
[1:08:33] the good tidings
[1:08:36] verse 2
[1:08:41] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[1:08:43] lord
[1:08:45] the year the acceptable year of the lord
[1:08:48] is the year of jubilee
[1:09:02] the acceptable year of the lord jesus in
[1:09:04] lucas
[1:09:22] and brother branham never understood why
[1:09:23] it was that that happened
[1:09:26] until god showed him
[1:09:28] that the first part
[1:09:31] pertained to his first coming
[1:09:32] pentecostal
[1:09:44] which says is the day of vengeance of
[1:09:46] our god
[1:09:49] he says that that part pertains to his
[1:09:51] second coming
[1:09:53] that's why he never read the read the
[1:09:55] second part
[1:09:58] it didn't pertain to his first coming
[1:09:59] but
[1:10:00] it pertained
[1:10:13] i believe when they were going to put
[1:10:15] the cornerstone in the tabernacle
[1:10:17] branham at the branham tabernacle
[1:10:19] he had a vision
[1:10:22] and in that vision the voice told him
[1:10:26] read second corinthians chapter
[1:10:29] second timothy chapter 4.
[1:10:35] speaks to timothy
[1:10:39] and there's many parts there but what i
[1:10:40] want to focus on
[1:10:54] you notice he wasn't told that he is an
[1:10:56] evangelist
[1:11:06] he started having evangelistic campaigns
[1:11:10] though he was a prophet
[1:11:12] he started as an evangelist
[1:11:14] do the work of an evangelist
[1:11:20] being that the year of the jubilee came
[1:11:22] recorded
[1:11:24] remember
[1:11:39] la gracias brother branham says that
[1:11:41] america rejected god's grace
[1:11:47] in that prophecy of second timothy
[1:11:48] chapter four
[1:11:51] he says that for some reason
[1:12:04] and he says for about 30 years preaching
[1:12:06] in that tabernacle
[1:12:10] i don't know why i never read the second
[1:12:12] part it is
[1:12:14] jesus that's because just like jesus
[1:12:17] when he read the prophecy of jubilee
[1:12:20] una parte
[1:12:40] the jubilee in that prophecy of uh to
[1:12:42] second timothy chapter four
[1:12:44] they're connected
[1:12:56] we're going to read a quote from brother
[1:12:57] branham from the message the junction of
[1:12:59] time
[1:13:02] i
[1:13:11] that we're living just at the near
[1:13:13] appearing of the second time of the
[1:13:15] coming of the lord jesus
[1:13:30] this time he's coming as a king of glory
[1:13:38] to take vengeance upon all who obey not
[1:13:40] the word of god
[1:13:46] remember brother branham says that in
[1:13:47] the stars you can find the bible
[1:13:50] and in his first coming was virgo
[1:13:53] he was born of a virgin
[1:13:57] we could say the second important star
[1:13:59] is
[1:14:01] leo the lion
[1:14:03] and when he comes for the second time
[1:14:06] he comes as a lion
[1:14:11] now the day of vengeance
[1:14:21] we're going to read the scripture of the
[1:14:22] second coming of our lord jesus
[1:14:27] this christ first thessalonians chapter
[1:14:29] 4 verse 16.
[1:14:34] of some time in the message and have now
[1:14:35] studied
[1:14:39] we understand this talks about the
[1:14:41] second coming of our lord jesus christ
[1:14:46] i want you to pay much attention to what
[1:14:47] i'm about to say
[1:14:54] increasing
[1:14:56] for the lord himself shall descend from
[1:14:58] heaven with the shout with the voice of
[1:14:59] archangel with the trump of god and the
[1:15:01] dead in christ shall rise first
[1:15:07] of all
[1:15:14] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:15:16] be caught up together with them in the
[1:15:17] clouds to meet the lord in the air and
[1:15:19] so shall we ever be with the lord yes
[1:15:24] [Music]
[1:15:36] now
[1:16:05] spiritual brother branham says that the
[1:16:06] trumpet means spiritual war iguera es
[1:16:09] critoral and scriptural war in canada
[1:16:12] in every age el mensahiro
[1:16:14] the messenger of that age
[1:16:17] a trumpet would sound
[1:16:59] also says that trump means feast
[1:17:02] and gathering of people
[1:17:06] that's why he says that the rapture is a
[1:17:08] revelation it's a revelation
[1:17:11] because the trumpet sounds
[1:17:14] there'll be a squeeze
[1:17:28] gathering all the
[1:18:10] to
[1:18:40] and with and and the first voice which i
[1:18:42] heard was that was as it were a trumpet
[1:18:44] with talking with me which said come up
[1:18:46] hither and i will show the things which
[1:18:48] must be hereafter
[1:18:57] and immediately i was in the spirit and
[1:18:59] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[1:19:01] one sat on the throne all right
[1:19:06] now brother branham says in revelation
[1:19:07] chapter four part three is the
[1:19:09] apocalypse
[1:19:11] revelation four one despot
[1:19:14] after the church was gone
[1:19:17] a door was opened
[1:19:23] and we went through all of that and
[1:19:25] found that was christ
[1:19:27] was the door
[1:19:29] and the same voice
[1:19:33] that was in the midst of the seven
[1:19:34] golden candlesticks
[1:19:38] and was also the same voice he heard in
[1:19:40] heaven
[1:19:42] saying come up hither juan subion john
[1:19:44] went up eso represent
[1:19:48] that it represented the church going in
[1:19:50] the rapture
[1:19:53] people take revelation 4 1.
[1:19:56] and they say that's the rapture
[1:19:58] and it is
[1:20:01] because it says come up hither
[1:20:19] [Music]
[1:20:31] jesus
[1:20:34] what does jesus do here in revelation 4
[1:20:35] 1.
[1:20:37] there's a voice of archangel
[1:20:40] and he joins it with the trumpet of god
[1:20:43] to resurrect
[1:20:44] and
[1:21:38] he said let's go to first thessalonians
[1:21:40] chapter four yes
[1:21:53] without before reading it
[1:22:24] the same voice
[1:22:26] that sum and john come up
[1:22:30] the same voice that said to john come up
[1:22:32] islamism
[1:22:36] is the same voice that summons the
[1:22:38] church someday
[1:22:41] amen summons the church
[1:22:44] and also the same voice
[1:22:47] that summoned john to come up here
[1:22:53] is the same voice that summoned dead
[1:22:55] lazarus out of the grave
[1:22:58] that same voice of archangel christo
[1:23:02] christ is the voice of archangels
[1:23:17] the same voice summoned lazarus
[1:23:22] did you notice that at the grave of
[1:23:24] lazarus
[1:23:26] he spoke with a loud voice
[1:23:28] trumpet voice of a trumpet
[1:23:31] voice of archangel
[1:23:33] the same voice
[1:23:39] we're going to show it to you a little
[1:23:40] more
[1:23:45] we're going to read from the message
[1:23:46] revelation chapter four part three
[1:23:49] paragraph 106
[1:23:53] now i'd like to comment this in primera
[1:23:56] in first thessalonians
[1:24:00] where it speaks about the second coming
[1:24:02] of our lord jesus christ
[1:24:06] we think that that scripture only speaks
[1:24:08] of the future
[1:24:10] but with the message
[1:24:12] on the resurrection
[1:24:13] and the trump
[1:24:28] for the different rapture
[1:25:01] but there's two things that make the
[1:25:03] voice of an archangel it's resurrection
[1:25:05] it's resurrection yes
[1:25:07] and it's judgment
[1:25:09] recorded
[1:25:18] says that it was two archangels miguel
[1:25:20] gabriel michael and gabriel
[1:25:24] that got set unto
[1:25:50] fire came from heaven
[1:26:05] for those that accept the message of
[1:26:06] their day yes and it's judgment but
[1:26:10] for those that reject the message
[1:26:15] now let's read the quote an apocalypse
[1:26:19] revelation chapter four number three
[1:26:26] let's turn to exodus 19th chapter of
[1:26:28] exodus and 16th verse
[1:26:32] brother branham here is just reading
[1:26:33] scriptures
[1:26:48] and it came to pass listen what when god
[1:26:50] ascended upon mount sinai a contest
[1:26:55] it came to pass on the third day in the
[1:26:56] morning
[1:27:01] that there were thunders lightning and a
[1:27:03] thick cloud upon the mountain
[1:27:08] and a voice of a trumpet exceedingly
[1:27:10] loud all right in espanol now in spanish
[1:27:14] and it says the sound of a trumpet uh
[1:27:30] so that
[1:27:57] i believe it was last sunday
[1:28:26] and only a single person was able to
[1:28:28] overcome that what happened
[1:28:31] the sound of the trumpets
[1:28:36] but that person that received the
[1:28:37] message
[1:28:39] she lived
[1:29:25] let us keep reading in paragraph 168.
[1:29:32] god said assemble them together i'll let
[1:29:33] you know what it is
[1:29:36] i'll show them what it is
[1:29:44] read and listen and the voice of the
[1:29:46] trumpet got louder and louder until it
[1:29:48] shook the earth
[1:29:50] you see what judgment is
[1:29:52] i don't want that then misericordia give
[1:29:54] me mercy
[1:29:57] what did he descend no enzo gloria
[1:29:59] shakina not in his shekinah glory
[1:30:03] but in the wrath of his judgments bowser
[1:30:06] voice of archangel is resurrection is
[1:30:08] resurrection
[1:30:10] and it's judgment but
[1:30:12] also voice of archangel
[1:30:15] it produces two things
[1:30:18] and tremble
[1:30:20] terramotos earthquakes
[1:30:26] elements
[1:30:27] in the message of the rapture
[1:30:31] in paragraph 168.
[1:31:01] here it's talking about the crucifixion
[1:31:02] of jesus
[1:31:08] but the rest said let us see whether
[1:31:10] elias will come and save him
[1:31:12] notice this
[1:31:13] jesus aviendo
[1:31:18] jesus when he had cried with a loud
[1:31:20] voice
[1:31:22] he yielded up a loud voice grant was
[1:31:25] observing loud voice watch volcan voice
[1:31:28] of
[1:32:09] screamed with a loud voice
[1:32:23] it was hiding god's throne
[1:32:26] but the true throne of god
[1:32:28] el calvario was at calvary
[1:32:31] brother adam says
[1:32:33] when the veil was wrenched
[1:32:36] one could see from the window the temple
[1:33:20] the ghost
[1:33:23] and behold the veil of the temple is
[1:33:24] rhett and twain
[1:33:26] from the top to the bottom
[1:33:28] and the earth did quake
[1:33:31] and the rocks did rent
[1:33:34] graves were
[1:33:38] and many bodies of the saints that slept
[1:33:40] the rose
[1:33:42] they arose
[1:33:44] and came out of the graves
[1:33:46] de
[1:33:49] and his santos
[1:33:50] of those that were sleeping were
[1:33:52] awakened
[1:33:55] and going out of the the the two of the
[1:33:57] graves
[1:34:00] after the
[1:34:02] resurrection into the holy city and
[1:34:04] appeared unto many was that
[1:34:06] voice of archangel
[1:34:08] it's judgment
[1:34:11] and jesus was receiving our judgment
[1:34:14] yes resurrection and that's resurrection
[1:34:18] voice of archangel is a loud voice
[1:34:22] cross dimensions
[1:34:24] earthquakes
[1:34:29] got to that place for a period of time
[1:34:32] three days later
[1:34:33] the bible says
[1:34:36] well he was at the tomb
[1:34:38] angel descended
[1:34:41] and there was a great earthquake
[1:34:44] and the stone was removed
[1:34:47] voice of archangel
[1:34:49] resurrection is judgment and
[1:34:50] resurrection it produces
[1:34:52] and it produces fear
[1:34:54] and earthquakes
[1:34:57] you read matthew 27 when 27.
[1:35:00] when he cried with a loud voice
[1:35:03] he said that those that were there were
[1:35:04] were fearful
[1:35:11] now voice of archangel is a very loud
[1:35:13] voice
[1:35:15] let's go to job 37 hope mismo experiment
[1:35:20] job himself also experience the voice of
[1:35:23] god
[1:35:26] verse 1
[1:35:40] here attentively the noise of his voice
[1:35:42] and the sound they go with out of his
[1:35:44] mouth
[1:35:49] he directed it under the whole heaven
[1:35:51] and the lightning unto the ends of the
[1:35:53] earth despues
[1:35:54] brahma is
[1:36:03] he thundereth with the voice of his
[1:36:04] excellency and he will not stay and he
[1:36:07] will not stay them when the voice is
[1:36:09] heard
[1:36:15] god thundered marvelously with his voice
[1:36:18] great things he doeth which we cannot
[1:36:20] comprehend was the trumpeter voice of
[1:36:22] trumpet
[1:36:48] the voice of archangel is judgment and
[1:36:50] resurrection
[1:36:54] jude chapter 1 verse 9.
[1:36:59] just notice the words that he uses here
[1:37:04] diablo disputant
[1:37:13] yet michael the archangel when
[1:37:15] contending with the devil he disputed
[1:37:17] about the body of moses does not bring
[1:37:20] does not bring against him a railing
[1:37:21] accusation but said the lord rebuked
[1:37:23] thee
[1:37:25] in espanol now i like it better how it
[1:37:27] says in spanish you say arkansas says
[1:37:29] archangel
[1:37:32] body of moses
[1:37:35] because moses himself experienced the
[1:37:37] voice of archangel cuando
[1:37:40] branham brother branham says
[1:37:42] that he died
[1:37:45] and his body was not did not was
[1:37:47] corrupted
[1:37:52] and he was raptured
[1:37:56] and in the mountain of transfiguration
[1:37:57] he appeared with elijah jesus and with
[1:38:00] jesus
[1:38:05] the reason why he went through that
[1:38:08] because he is a type of christian
[1:38:10] christ died
[1:38:13] but his body was not corrupted
[1:38:15] he resurrected
[1:38:17] and he was raptured
[1:38:23] now the clown
[1:38:26] is
[1:38:27] la peluca the cloud is the wig
[1:38:30] of the judge
[1:38:32] the cloud also
[1:38:35] is god's throne
[1:38:40] god transports his throne
[1:38:55] [Music]
[1:39:09] that there was a great explosion
[1:39:13] a great sound
[1:39:15] a thunder que
[1:39:17] that it was like a roar
[1:39:25] he says in the message trying to do
[1:39:26] god's service without it being god's
[1:39:27] will
[1:39:31] something said to me turn it right
[1:39:37] i forgot to bring the article about the
[1:39:38] clown
[1:39:42] but you know that the prophet about the
[1:39:44] cloud the prophet had to turn it over
[1:39:47] the christian to be able to see christ's
[1:39:48] face
[1:39:51] when that angel descended unto the tomb
[1:39:53] of jesus hero la piedra he moved the the
[1:39:56] stone
[1:39:59] circle
[1:40:00] there's more about that but there's not
[1:40:01] enough time
[1:40:03] he said turn it to the right
[1:40:24] you see what it is the cro the head of
[1:40:27] christ for hoffman hoffman
[1:40:31] at 33 years
[1:40:34] here look in here see his black beard
[1:40:37] his face
[1:40:38] his eyes
[1:40:40] nose and everything else
[1:40:43] you see the part of his hair right here
[1:40:48] he's
[1:41:03] the universe of the universe
[1:41:06] supreme judge of heaven and of earth
[1:41:10] in the message the patmos vision pelo
[1:41:12] blanco this is white hair
[1:41:16] antigone anybody knows that those are
[1:41:19] the old judges in the ancient days
[1:41:26] like english judges used to wear a wig
[1:41:29] snow white
[1:41:43] and here he is showing that john over in
[1:41:58] that's also the voice of a trumpet
[1:42:00] trumpet voice of trump
[1:42:02] voice of archangel jose voice of thunder
[1:42:04] islamism it's the same voice
[1:42:07] here's the key
[1:42:10] that connects to catas barnia depends
[1:42:26] when they hear the voice
[1:43:09] ventidos the father in saint john 5 22.
[1:43:14] let's go to john 5 22.
[1:43:20] there's a judgment further on in the
[1:43:21] future del
[1:43:55] for as the father raiseth up the dead
[1:43:57] and quickeneth them even so the son
[1:43:59] quickeneth whom he will poor el padre
[1:44:01] and
[1:44:03] for the father judgeth no man
[1:44:07] but have commanded all judgment unto the
[1:44:09] sun
[1:44:11] verse 25
[1:44:15] verily verily i say unto you the hour is
[1:44:17] coming and now is
[1:44:32] when the dead shall hear the voice of
[1:44:33] the son of god and they
[1:44:35] and they that here shall live
[1:44:44] for as the father hath life in himself
[1:44:46] so hath he given the son to have life in
[1:44:48] himself
[1:44:53] also giving him authority to
[1:44:55] to execute because he is the son of man
[1:45:00] today
[1:45:05] for the hours coming in which all that
[1:45:06] are in the grave shall hear his voice
[1:45:15] and shall come forth they that have done
[1:45:17] good unto the resurrection of life and
[1:45:19] they that have done evil unto the
[1:45:20] resurrection of damnation
[1:45:23] every human being
[1:45:24] in the past
[1:45:26] in this present time
[1:45:28] and in the future
[1:46:09] and he was raptured
[1:46:36] this quote first in the message what is
[1:46:38] the attraction on the mountain
[1:46:42] paragraph 144.
[1:46:53] the very next day standing there a
[1:46:55] whirlwind came down and blasted the
[1:46:57] mountains out rocks cut the top of the
[1:46:59] trees about three or four feet above my
[1:47:01] head
[1:47:03] made three big blasts
[1:47:05] hermanos vigneron coriendo
[1:47:10] and the brothers come running over there
[1:47:11] was about 15 men standing there
[1:47:15] preaches and everything else give way
[1:47:17] what is it
[1:47:20] he said what was it
[1:47:26] i said judgment is striking the west
[1:47:27] coast
[1:47:29] about two days after that
[1:47:33] alaska the earthquake almost sunk alaska
[1:47:37] they said it was a whirlwind an
[1:47:39] explosion an explosion
[1:47:41] judgment
[1:47:43] earthquake
[1:47:45] alaska that almost drowns alaska salmon
[1:47:48] psalm
[1:47:57] this scripture will explain why it took
[1:47:58] place that way
[1:48:01] the voice of thy thunder estava
[1:48:05] was in the whirlwind
[1:48:12] the lightnings lightened the world and
[1:48:14] the earth trembled and shook
[1:48:31] when the earthquake that almost drowned
[1:48:33] alaska took place
[1:48:37] i thought it was during the same time in
[1:48:39] 1963
[1:48:41] when the cloud appeared
[1:48:43] but it wasn't so
[1:48:59] gifts
[1:49:00] my brother angel
[1:49:04] he answered some of those questions
[1:49:06] young foundations
[1:49:08] a young foundation sent to my brother
[1:49:11] a calendar las vegas important
[1:49:40] appeared
[1:49:42] and the 27th
[1:49:45] in alaska is when the earthquake of
[1:49:47] alaska took place
[1:49:49] today is the 27th
[1:50:23] in alaska for instance the great
[1:50:24] earthquake in alaska
[1:50:28] never has been an earthquake like that
[1:50:30] in all the world sevilla
[1:50:32] did you notice
[1:50:35] it came on good friday
[1:50:51] so it's no way this could have happened
[1:50:52] in the month of april
[1:50:54] and on that calendar yeah yeah the young
[1:50:56] foundation they're from young
[1:50:57] foundations
[1:50:59] it says it was the 27th of march
[1:51:03] and google so what i did i got on google
[1:51:13] and surely it was on the 27th of march
[1:51:17] today is the 27th of march
[1:51:20] and when god jesus used the voice of
[1:51:22] archangels
[1:51:25] it was in matthew 27.
[1:51:28] would he use the voice of archangel
[1:51:31] that was in verse 15. cincuenta
[1:51:56] this date is very important
[1:52:30] i believe he also uses the word voice of
[1:52:32] trumpet
[1:52:35] says that they're killed
[1:52:39] they're placed in the plaza in jerusalem
[1:53:11] produces fear eaten and and trembling
[1:53:15] a tremble an earthquake
[1:53:18] el raptor let's go to the message of the
[1:53:20] rapture
[1:53:23] paragraph 191 save
[1:53:32] i know the voice of archangel produces
[1:53:33] fear but
[1:53:35] in california but for our brother and
[1:53:36] there in california
[1:53:51] how much more would god have to protect
[1:53:52] the bride that's in california asi como
[1:53:54] rabe just like rehab
[1:53:56] de la noble she is a type of bride
[1:53:59] god protected
[1:54:02] though there was judgment and
[1:54:04] earthquakes
[1:54:06] around the entire
[1:54:11] in california i believe god's going to
[1:54:13] protect our brethren in california
[1:54:17] it says here in the message the rapture
[1:54:19] from brother branham just
[1:54:33] los angeles will go beneath the ocean i
[1:54:35] see diesel senor thus saith the lord
[1:54:38] it will estaba
[1:54:40] she is done
[1:54:42] she is washed
[1:54:44] she is finished
[1:54:47] i don't know when pero dida
[1:55:03] remember many of you men standing right
[1:55:05] there that rock
[1:55:07] los angeles now he starts to speak of
[1:55:08] los angeles
[1:55:12] and then he starts to speak of the world
[1:55:14] when they're in 64.
[1:55:31] and that light and fire falling from
[1:55:32] heaven around the rock where we were
[1:55:34] standing there
[1:55:41] rocks flying out the mountains and
[1:55:42] flying across there she blasted three
[1:55:45] times hard
[1:55:49] and i said judgment would strike the
[1:55:50] west coast
[1:55:52] alaska
[1:55:53] two days after that alaska almost sunk
[1:55:56] all right
[1:55:57] now i written a message okay
[1:56:01] that's titled ashamed and elijah says
[1:56:03] preach in 1965.
[1:56:05] julio uh
[1:56:07] the 11th of july
[1:56:11] he said that when he did that in
[1:56:12] california
[1:56:14] he was unconscious
[1:56:16] the first thing that he remembered
[1:56:20] is that he was on the street
[1:56:22] with billy and another brother
[1:56:24] he wasn't conscious
[1:56:43] [Applause]
[1:56:55] and it's on the tape
[1:57:00] do you know that brother johnny was
[1:57:01] there
[1:57:02] what a privilege
[1:57:07] jude 1 7.
[1:57:24] even as sodom and gomorrah and the
[1:57:26] cities of them in like manner giving
[1:57:28] themselves over to fornication and going
[1:57:30] after strange flesh are set forth as an
[1:57:32] example suffering the vengeance of
[1:57:34] eternal life
[1:57:36] now
[1:57:50] and i like how it says in english
[1:57:53] they were placed set forth as an example
[1:57:57] suffering the vengeance
[1:57:59] of eternal fire
[1:58:03] if god wants to condemn a city
[1:58:32] he took that same
[1:58:46] doctors heal yourselves
[1:58:50] brother brother mata says that brother
[1:58:52] branham says
[1:58:55] it's because maybe jesus
[1:58:58] jesus had a fractured leg
[1:59:14] heaven
[1:59:17] and speaks about the great works that
[1:59:18] were done there
[1:59:22] brother branham says the great works
[1:59:23] that were performed there
[1:59:25] in capernaum
[1:59:55] because it means that the resurrection
[1:59:57] is going to take place
[1:59:58] and the rapture
[2:00:00] but it's also judgmental
[2:00:03] for those that reject the message
[2:00:06] not of the past
[2:00:07] but of their present day
[2:00:10] many people accept jesus on calvary
[2:00:13] but they don't accept the message of
[2:00:15] today
[2:00:17] they'll be saved
[2:00:18] they'll he'll hear voice of archangel
[2:00:22] in the white throne judgment
[2:00:25] jesus in el calvario but just because
[2:00:27] they believe in the cross of jesus at
[2:00:28] the cross on calvary
[2:00:31] doesn't mean they'll go in the rapture
[2:00:34] you've got to be born again
[2:01:19] those of you that went if you remember
[2:01:21] when we went to sabino canyon
[2:01:25] these are enormous rocks
[2:01:28] one is over here on this side
[2:01:30] like right up here
[2:01:32] and one others like down here
[2:01:34] come on
[2:01:54] for you are not come unto the mount that
[2:01:56] might be touched that burned with fire
[2:01:57] nor blackness nor darkness and tempest
[2:02:00] also needed
[2:02:08] and the sound of a trumpet and the voice
[2:02:09] of words which the voice that they which
[2:02:12] heard and treated that the that the word
[2:02:14] should not be spoken to them anymore
[2:02:25] for they could not endure that which was
[2:02:27] commanded and if so much as a beast
[2:02:29] touched the mountain it shall be stoned
[2:02:31] and or thrust through with the darts
[2:02:34] here talks about mount sinai
[2:02:37] they were receiving laws
[2:02:42] because they rejected the grace of their
[2:02:43] date
[2:03:17] and it was so terrible and so terrible
[2:03:19] was the site that moses said i
[2:03:20] exceedingly fear and quake
[2:03:24] the bible says that we have not got
[2:03:25] close to that mountain syno
[2:03:40] and to an innumerable
[2:03:55] see that you refuse not to speaketh for
[2:03:57] if they escape not who refuse them to
[2:03:59] speak on earth much more shall not we
[2:04:02] escape if we turn away from he that
[2:04:03] speaketh from heaven
[2:04:06] because when jesus comes
[2:04:17] the heavens and the earth
[2:04:55] multitudes in the valley of decision for
[2:04:57] the day of the lord is near in the
[2:04:59] valley of decisions
[2:05:05] the sun and the moon shall be darkened
[2:05:06] and the stars shall withdraw the shining
[2:05:11] the lord shall also roar out of cyan
[2:05:15] another is voice from jerusalem
[2:05:32] you shall know that i am the lord your
[2:05:33] god
[2:05:35] dwelling in zion
[2:05:37] my holy mountain
[2:05:40] then shall jerusalem be holy ye
[2:05:44] and there shall no strangers pass
[2:05:45] through her anymore
[2:06:00] and i saw another mighty angel come down
[2:06:02] from heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[2:06:04] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[2:06:05] was as if it were the sun and his feet
[2:06:07] as pillars of fire
[2:06:14] had in his hand a little is open and set
[2:06:16] right up set his right foot upon the sea
[2:06:18] and his left foot upon the earth
[2:06:21] and he cried with a loud voice
[2:06:28] and when he had cried seven thunders
[2:06:30] uttered their voices
[2:06:32] let us pray
[2:06:36] lord heavenly father we thank you for
[2:06:37] this message
[2:06:39] we know it's not judgment
[2:06:42] but it's a warning
[2:07:37] [Music]
