[51:54] you
[51:56] oh if I am lying to
[51:59] you that God may take away my

[1:08:29] there was
[1:08:31] light now let's go to verse
[1:08:33] [Music]
[1:08:46] 11 and God said let the Earth bring
[1:08:49] forth grass the herb yielding seed and
[1:08:51] the fruit tree yielding fruit after His
[1:08:54] Kind whose seed is in itself upon the
[1:08:56] Earth and it was
[1:09:03] [Music]
[1:09:08] s and the Earth brought forth grass and
[1:09:11] Herb yielding seed after his kind and
[1:09:13] the tree yielding fruit whose seed was
[1:09:15] in itself after his kind and God saw
[1:09:18] that it was good

[1:09:51] word Lord give us what we need
[1:09:57] Lord Lord may it be you that's passing
[1:09:59] through this
[1:10:02] church we subject every contrary Spirit
[1:10:05] to your
[1:10:06] word in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:10:08] Christ amen
[1:10:10] amen before you be seated
[1:10:12] brother I why don't you greet your
[1:10:14] brothers next to you God bless
[1:10:17] you give him a smile bless your
[1:10:22] brother
[1:10:25] feel free to greet your brother and your
[1:10:28] sister once you do so you may be seated
[1:10:36] amen it's so good to give a smile to
[1:10:38] your brother or your
[1:10:40] sister that gives him a
[1:10:43] message that you've got God in your
[1:10:48] heart and that you love God am amen
[1:10:52] Brothers
[1:10:55] love many times we want to pray for the
[1:10:58] person for them to be
[1:11:03] healed those evil spirits to come out of
[1:11:06] them so they be not
[1:11:08] troubled but then when you greet your
[1:11:11] brother you give them a smile you give
[1:11:14] them a
[1:11:16] hug that's how you get the demons out
[1:11:19] with love with love
[1:11:22] amen
[1:11:26] this morning we're going to continue the
[1:11:28] theme that we've been carrying
[1:11:31] about this will be message number
[1:11:36] four and as a subtitle it will be the
[1:11:38] original word
[1:11:45] Amen brother brandom it's so tremendous
[1:11:48] what the prophet has brought
[1:11:52] us
[1:11:56] and everything that I'm speaking on I'm
[1:11:57] getting it out of the message the spoken
[1:11:59] word is the Original
[1:12:03] Seed and when I start to hear that
[1:12:05] message many
[1:12:11] times it really shook me up and I said
[1:12:13] that's so important what the prophet
[1:12:17] brought because the spoken
[1:12:20] word is the Original Seed
[1:12:24] so then we see that in
[1:12:30] Genesis and we see there that every seed
[1:12:32] bring forth of its own
[1:12:36] kind the tree the Tomato the
[1:12:40] avocado those are
[1:12:42] seeds but the Original Seed is the
[1:12:46] spoken
[1:12:50] word so when God formed the heavens and
[1:12:53] the
[1:12:58] Earth he didn't grab from another planet
[1:13:00] a portion to form the the Earth
[1:13:07] here he didn't take a certain Ray or a
[1:13:09] certain star to form the
[1:13:12] light he said let there be
[1:13:15] light the spoken word is the Original
[1:13:20] Seed he took it from nothing
[1:13:27] he didn't take this part to form just
[1:13:28] like
[1:13:29] us like this wood it came from a sea a
[1:13:34] tree someone cut it down went to the
[1:13:39] store they purchased it and created this
[1:13:44] Pulpit now men human beings created
[1:13:48] this by from something that was already
[1:13:51] created but God
[1:13:56] he didn't have anything to grab and form
[1:13:59] something he simply just
[1:14:03] spoke The Original
[1:14:06] Seed
[1:14:08] amen the prophet says do you
[1:14:13] know everything you see
[1:14:17] tonight is God's word
[1:14:22] materialized
[1:14:24] do you know that your word that your
[1:14:25] body is God's word
[1:14:30] materialized do you know them being
[1:14:32] there is God's word
[1:14:37] materialized do you know that concrete
[1:14:39] is God's spoken word
[1:14:44] materialized you know this whole earth
[1:14:47] is God spoke and said that it be
[1:14:49] materialized he spoke and
[1:14:52] said let there
[1:14:57] be and he believed his own
[1:15:01] word and the word and the Earth came
[1:15:03] into
[1:15:04] existence if it
[1:15:06] didn't where did it come
[1:15:09] from will you say it come off the sun
[1:15:14] well and who spoke the sun into
[1:15:19] existence see everything is God's
[1:15:22] word
[1:15:24] the worlds were framed by the word of
[1:15:26] God the Bible said
[1:15:29] so God spoke
[1:15:32] it and he believed in his own word and
[1:15:34] there it
[1:15:36] was now God has spoken of his
[1:15:39] word just believe
[1:15:42] him and Watch What
[1:15:45] Happens no now when he speaks
[1:15:49] something this is his word initially
[1:15:52] first
[1:15:54] any other word that's contrary to
[1:15:56] this is not God's
[1:15:59] word it has come from the
[1:16:03] Bible so then the spoken word of God
[1:16:07] it's
[1:16:09] original all that God
[1:16:11] created he spoke it and it's
[1:16:16] original what's the original has life
[1:16:20] and it comes
[1:16:22] again because the original has
[1:16:27] life now when you see a horse and you
[1:16:29] see a
[1:16:30] donke these are original
[1:16:34] seeds uh the if the horse dies there's
[1:16:37] more
[1:16:39] horses but when a horse and a donkey
[1:16:42] they
[1:16:44] mix that produces a
[1:16:48] mule when that meal
[1:16:50] dies it doesn't reproduce
[1:16:55] because it's not an original
[1:16:58] seed the prophet tells us like
[1:17:02] this so then with the birth that we've
[1:17:05] got the birth that you've
[1:17:08] got when you came from your mother and
[1:17:10] your father that's death amen Brothers
[1:17:15] how many have heard
[1:17:17] that that your
[1:17:19] birth through sex it's death
[1:17:25] so then when Jesus
[1:17:28] came and the angel came to the Virgin
[1:17:33] Mary she heard what the the angel spoke
[1:17:35] to the Virgin
[1:17:38] Mary forgive me the the Virgin Mary
[1:17:41] heard what the angel
[1:17:42] told the angel is a
[1:17:45] messenger brought her the
[1:17:48] message she heard the
[1:17:52] message
[1:17:53] said the holy spirit will make a Shadow
[1:17:55] upon
[1:17:56] you so she
[1:17:58] heard she
[1:18:01] accepted and now the Holy Spirit was in
[1:18:05] her the prophet tells
[1:18:08] us it was without a
[1:18:14] sensation no sensation between man and
[1:18:17] woman so when the birth
[1:18:21] came he just heard the
[1:18:24] he
[1:18:26] accepted but there was no sexual
[1:18:29] sensation in
[1:18:31] her that's why that Doctrine
[1:18:34] moves that you've got to
[1:18:39] cry but we'll get to
[1:18:41] that the prophet also
[1:18:43] says I don't
[1:18:46] believe in a in a dry-eyed
[1:18:50] repentance when you accept the Lord
[1:18:54] you recognize it's a
[1:18:56] sin you can't take
[1:18:59] it shout and
[1:19:06] cry Supernatural is touching your
[1:19:10] being the prophet tells
[1:19:14] us I don't have this quote on the
[1:19:17] screen now when a man is
[1:19:20] born he's born with the spirit of this
[1:19:24] world the prophet says
[1:19:27] so and the message questions and answers
[1:19:30] on Hebrews
[1:19:31] chapter when a man is
[1:19:34] born he's born with the spirit of this
[1:19:38] world that's why he has to be born
[1:19:44] again this Spirit comes from the mother
[1:19:46] and father's
[1:19:48] conception which was sexual
[1:19:51] conception
[1:19:56] and the absolute could live
[1:19:58] forever so he has to be born
[1:20:02] again now that's a
[1:20:06] birth now the prophet tells us we have
[1:20:09] to because all of
[1:20:12] these have been
[1:20:15] reproduced this seed of God's spoken
[1:20:19] word has not been
[1:20:21] reproduced
[1:20:23] until the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:20:25] came by the spoken
[1:20:28] word Prophet
[1:20:30] says we read this the last
[1:20:34] time in the message the spoken word is
[1:20:36] the Original
[1:20:37] Seed all the sons of
[1:20:40] God should be the same yes
[1:20:45] sir born of the word and the
[1:20:48] spirit this brings us
[1:20:51] again to to the spoken
[1:20:56] word when you're born of the water and
[1:20:58] the
[1:21:00] spirit like John chapter
[1:21:03] 3 to be born of the water and the spirit
[1:21:06] what does it
[1:21:11] do it brings you right back into the
[1:21:13] place where you should have been at the
[1:21:16] beginning that's the reason of Christ's
[1:21:19] death brings us right back
[1:21:24] where sons of God by the
[1:21:28] word and the spirit of
[1:21:33] God now we're born of the spoken
[1:21:36] word the prophet also
[1:21:40] says this brings us back to the spoken
[1:21:45] word so we this the word of God made
[1:21:50] manifest and that's what we want for us
[1:21:53] to be sons of
[1:21:55] God the way to be sons of
[1:21:58] God is how you're born in your
[1:22:03] family you're the son of your father and
[1:22:05] of your
[1:22:07] mother the only way to be a Son of
[1:22:10] God is when you're born again by the
[1:22:14] word and of the spirit but many the
[1:22:19] prophet tells
[1:22:21] us
[1:22:23] inor you say in Spanish uh incub you
[1:22:27] stay in an
[1:22:29] incubator was glad to know that you're
[1:22:32] awake I didn't expect to many
[1:22:35] answers and they just stay there there's
[1:22:39] no
[1:22:41] life but I hope you're following me
[1:22:43] because we're getting to
[1:22:45] something the prophet
[1:22:47] says every
[1:22:50] seed must come after its
[1:22:54] kind in English uses the word
[1:22:59] kind every seed according to its
[1:23:02] kind Mankind and there's the word
[1:23:06] mankind which is the human race the
[1:23:10] prophet
[1:23:12] says God made
[1:23:14] Man In His
[1:23:17] Image after his
[1:23:20] kind to be his word
[1:23:23] on
[1:23:25] Earth that's God's original purp when he
[1:23:29] created
[1:23:30] Adam to be the God not of heaven but of
[1:23:35] the
[1:23:36] earth that was his
[1:23:40] purpose but it all got out of
[1:23:43] order death came
[1:23:46] in and it wasn't until the Lord Jesus
[1:23:48] Christ
[1:23:51] came to restore with the first
[1:23:55] Adam to bring us in fellowship with
[1:23:58] God now we can be sons of
[1:24:01] God gods of this
[1:24:05] Earth he expressed it in Jesus Christ
[1:24:08] what was
[1:24:10] it God was in
[1:24:12] Christ that's a man after his
[1:24:16] kind when God which is the
[1:24:19] word how many knows he was the word
[1:24:23] when the word was in Christ a man a
[1:24:27] human
[1:24:28] man expressing itself through
[1:24:31] him that was
[1:24:35] God in word in Christ expressing
[1:24:38] itself and
[1:24:42] God in the beginning made man in his own
[1:24:47] image and that's the kind of man that
[1:24:49] God makes
[1:24:50] today Seminary
[1:24:53] and the
[1:24:54] schools and
[1:24:57] incubators hat turns out a bunch of
[1:25:01] hybrids but when God calls a
[1:25:05] man makes him in his own
[1:25:09] image the word Made Alive in him that's
[1:25:12] right there he
[1:25:15] is that's God's
[1:25:18] man in his own image and very likeness
[1:25:21] Jesus
[1:25:23] he'll do the works that I
[1:25:26] do so God made man in his own image
[1:25:29] after his
[1:25:31] kind his kind what is his
[1:25:33] kind the
[1:25:35] word is the
[1:25:38] word then if a man denies God's
[1:25:42] word how can he be in God's
[1:25:45] image just ask the
[1:25:48] question ask
[1:25:51] yourself
[1:25:53] how can you be in God's
[1:25:55] image and deny God's
[1:26:00] word when the word is expressed image of
[1:26:03] himself amen amen are you awake
[1:26:07] brothers let's go to
[1:26:09] Matthew chapter
[1:26:15] 11 we want to go a little quickly
[1:26:17] because I want to get to a certain
[1:26:20] point Matthew 11 verse
[1:26:26] one here's where the Lord's talking
[1:26:28] about John the
[1:26:30] Baptist Matthew
[1:26:39] 111 and it came to pass when Jesus had
[1:26:41] made an end commandment commanding his
[1:26:43] 12 disciples he departed then to teach
[1:26:45] and to preach in their
[1:26:51] cities
[1:26:52] now when John had heard in the prison
[1:26:54] The Works of Christ he sent two of his
[1:26:59] disciples and said unto him art thou the
[1:27:02] he that should come or do we look for
[1:27:09] another Jesus answered and said unto
[1:27:12] them go and show John again those things
[1:27:14] which you do hear and
[1:27:21] see
[1:27:26] the blind will receive their sight the
[1:27:27] lame walk the lepers are cleansed the
[1:27:30] deaf here the dead raised up and the
[1:27:32] poor have the gospel preached to them
[1:27:35] now verse
[1:27:37] 11 verely I say unto
[1:27:43] you among them that are born of women
[1:27:46] hath no one risen greater than John the
[1:27:50] Baptist so the Lord's telling us amongst
[1:27:54] women none has risen
[1:27:57] greater than John the
[1:28:00] Baptist that was a clean
[1:28:03] man a man that God chose before the
[1:28:06] foundation of the world but it says but
[1:28:13] notwithstanding he that is the least in
[1:28:15] the Kingdom of
[1:28:16] Heaven is greater than
[1:28:21] he
[1:28:22] I'll say it
[1:28:25] again that's the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:28:30] speaking none greater than John the
[1:28:32] Baptist has
[1:28:35] risen but he is that the least in the
[1:28:38] Kingdom of
[1:28:39] Heaven is greater than
[1:28:43] he that's why the Apostle Paul would say
[1:28:46] I'm the
[1:28:47] least because I persecuted the
[1:28:50] church and that should be our
[1:28:54] mentality that I'm the least of the
[1:28:56] Kingdom of
[1:28:59] Heaven I I don't want to be seated at
[1:29:01] the
[1:29:04] table if I could just be a
[1:29:10] rug the least in the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:29:12] is greater than
[1:29:13] he verse
[1:29:18] 13 for all the prophets and the law
[1:29:20] prophesied until John
[1:29:25] now the Lord Jesus Christ is telling the
[1:29:27] people and if he will receive
[1:29:31] it this is Elias which was for to
[1:29:35] come he that hath ears to hear Let Him
[1:29:42] hear the Lord is telling the people the
[1:29:44] disciples
[1:29:46] there this is that Elias that is to
[1:29:50] come now he was not
[1:29:54] literal but he was anointed by the
[1:29:56] spirit of
[1:29:58] el the prophet says that John the
[1:30:00] B he just preached the
[1:30:03] word but he didn't have
[1:30:05] Miracles but when the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:30:08] came now the Miracles did
[1:30:11] come Billy Graham that's why brother
[1:30:13] Bram says Billy
[1:30:15] Graham he was anointed by the spirit of
[1:30:18] John the
[1:30:20] Baptist Billy Graham didn't have
[1:30:22] miracles in his
[1:30:23] ministry he just preached the
[1:30:27] word he that hath ears to hear Let Him
[1:30:31] hear this day if there's been an
[1:30:35] Elias and if you want to
[1:30:38] receive he is that Elias that is to
[1:30:43] come there's a purpose why Elias com a
[1:30:48] purpose there's seven Church
[1:30:50] ages Church ages the first
[1:30:54] church it started in the year
[1:30:59] 33 but as the church started to go along
[1:31:01] and
[1:31:02] run it started to
[1:31:06] fall The Original
[1:31:09] Seed it started to
[1:31:12] burst the leaves started to come
[1:31:15] out the stump and the the
[1:31:18] branches but with time it started
[1:31:23] fall amen
[1:31:26] Brothers the prophet
[1:31:29] says when we see the Holy Spirit come to
[1:31:31] the
[1:31:34] church and it starts to discern the
[1:31:36] heart the thoughts of the
[1:31:39] heart doing these Great
[1:31:45] Signs and it comes back into the evening
[1:31:47] time when the light is
[1:31:50] shining
[1:31:54] we see him and the same thing he did
[1:31:56] there in
[1:31:57] Sodom before it was
[1:32:01] burned we see that angel with his back
[1:32:04] turned
[1:32:06] saying why did Sarah
[1:32:09] laugh so we see
[1:32:12] Abraham he saw these three
[1:32:15] men he didn't say Lords he said
[1:32:19] Lord he said give me a Big C
[1:32:22] give me
[1:32:24] milk I want to have
[1:32:28] Fellowship that's why Jesus told the
[1:32:32] pH you cry and I believe you're sons of
[1:32:36] but if you were sons
[1:32:37] of have done the same works as
[1:32:41] Abraham he had fellowship with but you
[1:32:44] want to
[1:32:47] kill there's no place for my word in
[1:32:50] you
[1:32:53] Abraham said bring a fat Cal bring me
[1:32:56] milk I want to have
[1:33:02] Fellowship so we see when Sarah was back
[1:33:04] there in the
[1:33:07] tent Prophet says she didn't laugh in
[1:33:09] with her mouth but in her heart in her
[1:33:15] heart and God said why did your wife
[1:33:18] Sarah laugh Jesus said
[1:33:22] like it was in the days of
[1:33:25] Sodom so shall it be in the days of the
[1:33:27] coming of man what is
[1:33:31] it it's the reason the coming of the
[1:33:33] Lord
[1:33:36] Jesus and that's many times what the
[1:33:38] world's doing
[1:33:40] today they're reasoning if Jesus is
[1:33:42] coming or not but the prophet says
[1:33:48] behold I send the prophet Elias
[1:33:55] before that great and terrible
[1:33:57] day that will destroy the
[1:34:03] world he'll return the hearts of the
[1:34:05] sons back to the
[1:34:08] original go back to the
[1:34:10] gospel go back to the power of
[1:34:13] God go back to the true Holy
[1:34:16] Ghost to Christ
[1:34:19] again before that great day
[1:34:23] come so we see this Prophet came to take
[1:34:26] us
[1:34:27] back to the original
[1:34:30] Faith because as time
[1:34:33] passed the word became
[1:34:36] hybrid doctrines rose
[1:34:38] up many things rose
[1:34:41] up but when this Prophet
[1:34:45] came and put things in their
[1:34:49] order said the spoken word is the
[1:34:51] original
[1:34:53] SE and put things in its
[1:34:57] place now we're getting to what I want
[1:34:59] to get
[1:35:02] to but the original Church began in
[1:35:06] Jerusalem in the year
[1:35:08] 33 after the death of
[1:35:10] Christ at the day of
[1:35:14] Pentecost that's where we've got to go
[1:35:16] back
[1:35:18] to I'm trying to go back there
[1:35:22] the day of
[1:35:25] Pentecost I don't know what's your
[1:35:26] motive or your
[1:35:27] objective but the day of
[1:35:30] Pentecost everyone got in one Accord
[1:35:34] their thoughts they put it
[1:35:36] aside their differences they put him
[1:35:42] aside I don't know what's your your
[1:35:44] thought or your motive this
[1:35:45] morning but the prophet is telling
[1:35:49] us I'm trying to get back
[1:35:52] to a
[1:35:54] point when we get to church you're
[1:35:59] healed that the Holy Ghost can come down
[1:36:01] in such a
[1:36:03] way that this literal
[1:36:05] building can be
[1:36:11] shaken how many testimonies have we
[1:36:13] heard from Sister L un fill
[1:36:17] more when the building would
[1:36:20] Shake
[1:36:21] I I believe our brother marus has also
[1:36:23] told me about
[1:36:26] that how much we desire for that to come
[1:36:29] back that depends on you it depends on
[1:36:33] you there's many
[1:36:36] things we've got to throw in the
[1:36:39] trash there's only one
[1:36:42] seed and that's the spoken
[1:36:47] word but you see that Antichrist move
[1:36:52] trying to make that
[1:36:58] Antichrist when the real spirit of God
[1:37:00] trying to move them back to the original
[1:37:01] Faith again look
[1:37:06] here what the polymer worm left the
[1:37:10] caterpillar and what the caterpillar
[1:37:12] left the
[1:37:15] canker and it got down until it it down
[1:37:18] to a stump Joel saw it
[1:37:21] and he
[1:37:23] said I will
[1:37:25] restore sayth the
[1:37:27] Lord all the
[1:37:29] years that they have
[1:37:32] eaten that seed was
[1:37:36] planted the messenger preaches a
[1:37:39] message the restoration of the brid
[1:37:43] tree because the spirits came the demons
[1:37:49] came and they started to eat that that
[1:37:51] bride
[1:37:52] tree until I was
[1:37:55] nothing it seemed as though the tree was
[1:37:59] dead the prophet says the life went to
[1:38:02] the
[1:38:03] roots it went to the
[1:38:05] roots but it's very important that the
[1:38:09] roots should be holding on to the word
[1:38:12] of
[1:38:13] God not holding on to your effect and
[1:38:16] your friends your
[1:38:18] family but the word of God
[1:38:23] when winter time
[1:38:25] comes the
[1:38:27] roots they're holding to the word of
[1:38:36] God now let's see what these worms they
[1:38:40] ate now we can speak about this
[1:38:43] individually a family Wise by as a
[1:38:48] church or as a universal bride
[1:38:53] but these worms they
[1:38:58] ate I want you to pay much attention to
[1:39:00] what the prophet is saying
[1:39:02] here I don't have this quote here in the
[1:39:05] message
[1:39:09] presuming then here come these four
[1:39:11] termites in
[1:39:12] one the same
[1:39:15] insect just in different
[1:39:17] stages Along come the Palmer worm what
[1:39:20] did it do
[1:39:22] first thing that it
[1:39:24] do it took the
[1:39:28] fruit brotherly

[1:39:43] children we can take it as a
[1:39:47] church depend how you want to take
[1:39:50] it

[1:39:58] individually you don't worry about your
[1:40:01] neighbor Amen to my
[1:40:04] neighbor this word is for
[1:40:06] me when this worm

[1:40:28] his eyes you give him a hug and just be

[1:40:33] yourself but those demons they're
[1:40:37] real those
[1:40:40] demons many
[1:40:41] times these
[1:40:44] demons they don't just want to kill your

[1:45:02] came the canker
[1:45:05] worm the caterpillar suck the life right
[1:45:08] out that's what happens
[1:45:11] sometimes we feel like we don't have
[1:45:13] life in
[1:45:15] us we're like a person on the
[1:45:19] benches
[1:45:21] and what brother Marcos preach was
[1:45:22] directly from
[1:45:25] God you might feel like you're at the
[1:45:27] point of
[1:45:30] end and that worm is just sucking the
[1:45:32] life out of
[1:45:34] you but a trunk was
[1:45:37] left Joel
[1:45:39] said I will
[1:45:42] restore that predestinated
[1:45:44] roote there's a
[1:45:48] promise if God's people canite
[1:45:51] can take out their differences love one
[1:45:54] another I will restore all the
[1:45:58] years that those demons
[1:46:00] ate because the
[1:46:03] demons they want to see us individually
[1:46:06] I'll defeat
[1:46:08] it separated and families
[1:46:10] defeated the church
[1:46:14] divided but we have this
[1:46:17] message the message of Malachi 4
[1:46:24] it came and sucked all the life out of
[1:46:26] the
[1:46:27] Church of that tree of
[1:46:30] God and then Luther
[1:46:33] came and then the Reformation
[1:46:37] started Luther was a a
[1:46:41] priest he wasn't a prophet he was a
[1:46:45] priest and he came with the message that
[1:46:47] just live by
[1:46:48] faith he started to see the
[1:46:53] mon the nuns serving their whole life
[1:46:55] for God it was by works not by
[1:47:00] Grace it's how much you could do for
[1:47:02] God then Luther
[1:47:04] came it's not by work it's by Grace it's
[1:47:10] by
[1:47:11] Grace the Reformation
[1:47:14] began the tree was almost
[1:47:18] useless and then Wesley came
[1:47:21] as something
[1:47:23] greater Wesley started to
[1:47:26] see they they went with that
[1:47:29] doctrine that Doctrine got
[1:47:33] organized we can keep sinning because by
[1:47:35] Grace We're
[1:47:37] saved Wesley
[1:47:39] said without
[1:47:41] Holiness no one will see
[1:47:44] God so you've got to live a holy life a
[1:47:47] clean
[1:47:48] life worthy of the Gospel
[1:47:51] something
[1:47:54] higher that's why Romans
[1:47:56] says shall we continue in so the grace
[1:48:00] would abound Paul
[1:48:03] responds let it not
[1:48:06] be don't we live not live just by Grace
[1:48:10] but something
[1:48:11] greater without
[1:48:13] Holiness no one will see
[1:48:16] God there's the
[1:48:19] restoration then Pentecost
[1:48:22] comes the restoration of the
[1:48:25] gifts but it started to get organized
[1:48:28] Wesley
[1:48:29] Wesley was they were very holy they
[1:48:33] could say
[1:48:34] Amen they were so
[1:48:36] holy but then Pentecost came and it was
[1:48:39] all
[1:48:40] shouts and they spoke in
[1:48:43] tongues and if you spoke in
[1:48:46] tongues if you didn't you didn't have
[1:48:48] the Holy
[1:48:48] Ghost they got
[1:48:51] organized then the messenger came and
[1:48:54] the message
[1:48:56] came he said if those gifts are here he
[1:48:59] said go into the gifts
[1:49:02] room and he put everything in its place
[1:49:06] Luther came Wesley came Pentecost came
[1:49:10] and then the messenger
[1:49:12] came The Original
[1:49:15] Seed the
[1:49:17] message now let's go to First
[1:49:19] Corinthians
[1:49:21] Chapter
[1:49:22] 13 Verse verse
[1:49:30] 10 but when that which is perfect is
[1:49:32] come then that which is in part shall be
[1:49:34] done
[1:49:37] away Luther came one
[1:49:39] part John Wesley one
[1:49:42] part Pentecost one
[1:49:45] part but then the perfect has
[1:49:48] come the spoken word
[1:49:51] word the messenger
[1:49:53] came and brought us this
[1:49:56] message to bring us
[1:49:58] back to
[1:50:01] Genesis bring us back to I was with
[1:50:06] Adam manmade in the likeness and image
[1:50:08] of God amen
[1:50:10] amen first
[1:50:13] John
[1:50:15] 32
[1:50:17] beloved now are we sons of God
[1:50:22] and it does not appear yet what we shall
[1:50:25] be but we
[1:50:27] know when he shall
[1:50:30] appear we shall be like
[1:50:33] him for we shall see him as he
[1:50:36] is Romans
[1:50:40] 8:29 for whom he did for
[1:50:43] know he also did
[1:50:48] predestinate to be conformed to to the
[1:50:50] to the image of his
[1:50:52] son this message
[1:50:55] came to bring us back to the image of
[1:50:59] the
[1:51:01] son bring us
[1:51:04] back to what we should have been in the
[1:51:07] beginning but since we're in this
[1:51:10] flesh a hybrid flesh it brings
[1:51:14] death but when you're born of the word
[1:51:17] and the spirit you're now sons of God
[1:51:20] now you're
[1:51:23] Eternal and God brings his eternal life
[1:51:26] in you the Holy
[1:51:29] Ghost you cannot
[1:51:31] die God cannot
[1:51:35] die now you've got a part of God in
[1:51:40] you that's why the quote brother Manuel
[1:51:42] read many weeks
[1:51:44] ago when a
[1:51:47] man surrenders completely to God
[1:51:51] he is
[1:51:54] omnipotent how many can accept
[1:51:58] that God is
[1:52:00] omnipotent but when a
[1:52:04] man surrenders completely to
[1:52:07] God not just
[1:52:10] 50% but surrenders all he
[1:52:12] has he is
[1:52:16] omnipotent and all that you ask shall be
[1:52:21] God's in
[1:52:25] you amen
[1:52:29] amen so then we
[1:52:31] see that we're a
[1:52:34] tree we're God's
[1:52:36] SE and if you
[1:52:40] feel like those worms started to eat the
[1:52:42] joy that love
[1:52:46] Fellowship that's for you brother s
[1:52:49] individually
[1:52:53] God want wants to see
[1:52:55] you to see you
[1:52:58] there he wants to see the church
[1:53:03] defeated how many want to see their
[1:53:04] Church defeated no no
[1:53:09] sir we've got the message of the hour
[1:53:12] we've got the greatest weapon the word
[1:53:15] of
[1:53:17] God we're going back to the beginning
[1:53:22] now the spoken word is the Original
[1:53:27] Seed when God was forming everything he
[1:53:30] said let it be let it be let it be amen
[1:53:35] that's how it was the spoken word is the
[1:53:39] Original
[1:53:41] Seed we're going to go back to the
[1:53:45] beginning but we're right now we're just
[1:53:48] practicing we've got to First dominate
[1:53:50] this flesh dominate this tongue These
[1:53:53] Eyes these hands these
[1:53:56] ears dominate
[1:53:58] yourself we're going to go back to that
[1:54:01] Earth to dominate this
[1:54:04] Earth First dominate this
[1:54:06] Earth Faceook your your your
[1:54:10] Facebook your social
[1:54:12] media dominates your
[1:54:16] mouth we want to dominate this Earth
[1:54:18] amen amen amen
[1:54:21] but what about this
[1:54:24] Earth only the sons of
[1:54:27] God born of the word of the spirit will
[1:54:30] come
[1:54:32] back the works that I
[1:54:35] do shall you do
[1:54:38] also and greater shall you do greater he
[1:54:42] promised
[1:54:44] it he wondered how could it be but did
[1:54:48] you
[1:54:48] notice
[1:54:50] when he performed his first
[1:54:52] miracle he took water and turned it into
[1:54:55] wine that's right he took
[1:55:01] water which potentially someday might
[1:55:03] have been wine but it was water
[1:55:07] first and when he fed 5,000 what did he
[1:55:12] do he took something that had been like
[1:55:15] water he took a
[1:55:18] fish that one swam and was born from an
[1:55:21] AG he broke
[1:55:23] it and another fish
[1:55:27] grew onto creation that was the original
[1:55:31] creation he took the bread that was once
[1:55:33] wheat it was a seed and become
[1:55:39] bread and he broke from this bread and
[1:55:41] the creation only
[1:55:43] multiplied what is the prophet saying
[1:55:46] here when he took a
[1:55:48] fish and literally in the
[1:55:51] hands this fish in one day it was an egg
[1:55:56] it came out of fish it started to grow
[1:55:59] someone fished it out and it fell in the
[1:56:02] hands of the
[1:56:04] Lord with that
[1:56:06] creation he multiplied
[1:56:10] it now with
[1:56:12] bread one day it was a seed became
[1:56:17] wheat someone harvested it
[1:56:20] went to the to the baker Made bread and
[1:56:24] then came in the hands of the
[1:56:26] Lord with that creation already
[1:56:29] created he
[1:56:32] multiplied tremendous and
[1:56:37] special but the spoken word is the
[1:56:40] Original Seed okay can you put the next
[1:56:47] quote but in the woods
[1:56:50] the prophet's
[1:56:52] speaking when he was in the woods and he
[1:56:55] was
[1:56:57] hunting he as asked for a
[1:57:01] squirrel the spoken word is the Original
[1:57:06] Seed said let there be light and there
[1:57:09] was
[1:57:11] light his own word created he didn't
[1:57:15] doubt his word and then The Light
[1:57:18] Came
[1:57:21] he didn't take something to make
[1:57:23] creation look what the prophet
[1:57:25] says but in the
[1:57:28] woods there was nothing
[1:57:31] there to make a
[1:57:34] squirrel there was
[1:57:36] nothing he didn't take a squirrel in his
[1:57:39] hands that one day was born grew and
[1:57:43] then was in his hand and then
[1:57:46] multiplied said there was nothing no
[1:57:49] squir there the prophet said let there
[1:57:54] be let there
[1:57:58] be the spoken word is the Original
[1:58:02] Seed and there was there with nothing to
[1:58:05] break it what is
[1:58:07] it it's the same Jesus
[1:58:10] Christ greater things than this will you
[1:58:13] do for I go to my
[1:58:16] father to not take something that has
[1:58:18] been created
[1:58:22] break something from it and multiply a
[1:58:24] creation but absolutely
[1:58:30] create showing that he's the same
[1:58:32] Jehovah that stood back there and said
[1:58:33] let there be and there
[1:58:36] was his word was made
[1:58:39] manifest when he was made Flesh on
[1:58:43] Earth he took his original
[1:58:46] creation broke it back and multiplied
[1:58:52] but now in the last days when he comes
[1:58:54] down among us
[1:58:56] again the same light they moved down
[1:59:00] said let there be
[1:59:03] lights he just speak creation into
[1:59:07] existence greater than this will you do
[1:59:10] I go to my father

[1:59:33] be speak it and it'll
[1:59:36] be and it was lost for years
[1:59:41] years but when the prophet came the
[1:59:44] first pull came the second pull came and
[1:59:48] the third pull came
[1:59:49] said but don't say
[1:59:51] it don't explain
