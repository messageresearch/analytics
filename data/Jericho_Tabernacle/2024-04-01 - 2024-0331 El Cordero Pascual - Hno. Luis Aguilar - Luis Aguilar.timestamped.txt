[1:07:27] happy
[1:07:31] Easter and this morning we just want to
[1:07:33] talk about a simple
[1:07:36] message and we want to entitle
[1:07:40] it the Easter lamb
[1:07:44] redemp Resurrection with the subtitles
[1:07:47] of redemption communion and
[1:07:54] Resurrection
[1:07:57] and this morning for many or probably
[1:07:59] some of you who don't know what the
[1:08:00] Passover
[1:08:04] is and this morning we wish to kind of
[1:08:06] elaborate a little bit on
[1:08:12] that I think by this level or this time
[1:08:15] we know that this has nothing to do with
[1:08:17] the
[1:08:21] bunnies but if you wish to crucify me
[1:08:23] then go right
[1:08:24] on
[1:08:26] but the children are not to blame
[1:08:31] amen but we want to go back to the main
[1:08:35] story of where this
[1:08:40] Passover and we know that in
[1:08:44] Genesis where the Lord sacrificed a
[1:08:50] lamb he was actually the first one who
[1:08:53] slain the lamb
[1:08:58] and gave clothing under Adam and
[1:09:02] Eve and then we find ourselves in the
[1:09:05] book of
[1:09:06] Exodus where the people of
[1:09:09] Israel are now in
[1:09:13] captivity and the descendants of
[1:09:16] Abraham find themselves now under
[1:09:21] slavery they have now become
[1:09:24] slaves the children of
[1:09:27] God
[1:09:29] were had become slaves in
[1:09:33] Egypt and then God sent a
[1:09:36] deliverer by the name of
[1:09:39] Moses Moses rose
[1:09:42] up and it's a very beautiful
[1:09:47] story and brother benam says that that's
[1:09:49] one of his favorite
[1:09:52] stories and then we see when he arrived
[1:09:54] in Egypt
[1:09:58] we see that Jehovah told Mo
[1:10:02] Moses you shall be
[1:10:05] like and Aaron shall be your
[1:10:09] prophet and so then we find out that
[1:10:11] Moses was like
[1:10:15] God and since Moses was a little bit
[1:10:18] slow to
[1:10:21] speak and it looked like Aaron had the
[1:10:24] ease of being able to
[1:10:27] speak so then God told
[1:10:31] Moses you tell Aaron what he must
[1:10:34] say he shall be uh your
[1:10:39] prophet and so then Moses and Aaron find
[1:10:41] themselves before
[1:10:45] pharaoh and then he we see that he
[1:10:47] directly tells Pharaoh it was two
[1:10:51] men with a
[1:10:54] rod
[1:10:57] they came face to face with the most
[1:10:59] powerful nation in the
[1:11:02] world and he said let the people of God
[1:11:05] go let my people
[1:11:07] go and Pharaoh just
[1:11:13] laughed and he tells him who do you
[1:11:15] think you are to tell me what to
[1:11:18] do and he replies god Jehovah has
[1:11:22] said because he had remembered of the
[1:11:26] promise that he made unto the children
[1:11:29] of
[1:11:32] Israel and then we see that Pharaoh's
[1:11:35] heart had
[1:11:38] hardened and that's where we're going to
[1:11:39] begin on the
[1:11:41] Passover Passover in English it's called
[1:11:46] Passover and it interprets itself as it
[1:11:49] passing over
[1:11:52] us it is a day of Celebration
[1:11:55] a day of
[1:11:57] remembrance because on that
[1:12:02] day the Lord took the people out of is
[1:12:05] or took the people of
[1:12:07] Israel with an with a strong
[1:12:10] hand from the house of slavery in
[1:12:15] Egypt because God wants the people to
[1:12:20] remember that God took them out of
[1:12:24] slavery is the reason why we have the
[1:12:30] Passover and the Lord told the people in
[1:12:33] Exodus
[1:12:34] 2:2 and this
[1:12:37] month shall be the first of the
[1:12:42] month this shall be unto you the first
[1:12:45] months of the
[1:12:48] year Nissan or there you can see that it
[1:12:52] kind of says like Nissan or abib or
[1:12:56] or in other words in March or
[1:12:58] May and these
[1:13:02] days and this month shall be the
[1:13:04] beginning of the
[1:13:06] months in uh March or uh
[1:13:10] April because on this
[1:13:13] month the Lord has taken us out of
[1:13:19] Egypt and then in this month there's a a
[1:13:23] feast of the Lord
[1:13:26] one of them is the
[1:13:29] Passover and the other one is the
[1:13:31] unleavened
[1:13:33] bread and the third is the uh tithings
[1:13:38] uh the first fruits the first fruits
[1:13:40] Sor the first fruits of the
[1:13:44] barley and in that month of Nissan in
[1:13:48] other words in March
[1:13:53] April and so on the 14th
[1:13:56] day of this
[1:13:58] month is
[1:14:01] Easter which means
[1:14:04] Redemption and then on the 15th
[1:14:06] day are the unleavened
[1:14:11] bread and that will continue on unto
[1:14:13] seven
[1:14:14] days and that
[1:14:19] means to live a holy life after you have
[1:14:21] lived a life of
[1:14:24] redemption and that's where you eat the
[1:14:25] bread between the seven
[1:14:27] days and then on the 16th
[1:14:31] day are the Feast of uh the first
[1:14:35] fruits the uh Harvest of The
[1:14:39] Barley is a type of the
[1:14:42] resurrection and we know that Jesus
[1:14:44] Christ is
[1:14:46] returning and then the
[1:14:50] Saints and then we're going to go into a
[1:14:52] little bit more detail into that
[1:14:56] but then when Moses came face to face
[1:14:58] with
[1:15:01] Pharaoh there were 10 plagues that hit
[1:15:06] Israel the first one was the water
[1:15:09] turning into
[1:15:11] blood the second one was the
[1:15:15] frogs and the third was the
[1:15:19] lice uh the fourth one was the
[1:15:23] Flies
[1:15:25] and then the fifth one was a pestilence
[1:15:27] on the
[1:15:31] livestock and the sixth one was the
[1:15:33] boils upon men and
[1:15:36] livestock H the seventh was the
[1:15:38] thunderstorm of hail and
[1:15:41] fire number eight was the
[1:15:46] Locust and the ninth was the three days
[1:15:48] of darkness upon
[1:15:51] Egypt and then the very last plague that
[1:15:54] hit
[1:15:55] Egypt was the
[1:15:57] death of the firstborn
[1:16:03] son that's where God told
[1:16:07] Moses to prepare all of
[1:16:10] Israel because in this
[1:16:14] night death is going to hit
[1:16:17] Egypt but it will not hit
[1:16:21] Israel but there will be a
[1:16:23] statute
[1:16:26] there will be a word that which we must
[1:16:29] follow to protect the children of
[1:16:33] Israel and then in this day we have the
[1:16:35] same
[1:16:36] thing it's the word of
[1:16:40] God we must fulfill it up to the
[1:16:45] dot if the children of Israel did not
[1:16:47] fulfill the whole
[1:16:49] thing it was a physical
[1:16:53] death there was literally going to be
[1:16:55] death within
[1:17:00] their we're not talking about a book of
[1:17:03] lies this
[1:17:06] book literally
[1:17:09] happened there was a death that hit
[1:17:12] struck the
[1:17:15] people and so then if you read the full
[1:17:17] chapter 12 of
[1:17:21] Exodus Moses begins to tell the people
[1:17:24] of Israel what they must
[1:17:26] do it says the 10th day of the
[1:17:29] month of Nissan
[1:17:32] abib which is March
[1:17:35] April you must take a lamp without uh
[1:17:38] any
[1:17:40] blemish there must not be any blemish on
[1:17:43] this
[1:17:46] lamb and you must uh hold that lamb for
[1:17:49] 4
[1:17:51] days and so then that will be the 14th
[1:17:54] day
[1:17:56] and then on the 14th
[1:17:59] day you shall slain the
[1:18:04] lamb before the congregation of
[1:18:09] Israel and in Spanish it says in between
[1:18:12] the two
[1:18:15] evenings in the English version it does
[1:18:17] not say the two evenings but in Spanish
[1:18:19] it
[1:18:20] does and everything must be
[1:18:23] consumed
[1:18:25] you must consume the whole
[1:18:28] lamb and if it's not possible for you to
[1:18:30] do
[1:18:31] so you must burn what's ever
[1:18:36] left and no bone must be broken on that
[1:18:39] lamp must be
[1:18:43] complete and now notice this is the law
[1:18:45] that God told Moses if one word is out
[1:18:50] of
[1:18:51] place there will be death amongst the
[1:18:53] people
[1:18:55] and then the
[1:18:57] blood must be on the both
[1:19:00] posts and on the lentil of the
[1:19:03] door because the death
[1:19:06] angel will be passing through the
[1:19:09] homes
[1:19:10] amen
[1:19:13] amen and then on the 14th
[1:19:17] day uh we're going to repeat it once
[1:19:19] again on the 10th
[1:19:21] day you shall take the land without a
[1:19:23] blemish
[1:19:25] you shall keep the lamb for four
[1:19:27] days and then on the 15th
[1:19:30] day you shall eat unleavened
[1:19:33] bread and then on the 16th
[1:19:36] day are the Feast of the first
[1:19:40] fruits now that was just a
[1:19:44] shadow of the land that was to come it
[1:19:47] was just a
[1:19:49] foreshadow over there with Abel it was a
[1:19:52] foreshadowing of what was to come
[1:19:56] and then the the lamb over here in
[1:19:59] Exodus was a
[1:20:03] foreshadowing of the perfect land that
[1:20:05] was to come on this
[1:20:07] day and that lamb was the Lord Jesus
[1:20:11] Christ when that lamb
[1:20:14] arrived that lamb was so
[1:20:16] simple it was so
[1:20:20] humble that the people didn't recognize
[1:20:22] who he was
[1:20:26] they thought that he was just another
[1:20:27] ordinary
[1:20:29] Prophet but then when John the
[1:20:33] Baptist saw that the Lord had
[1:20:36] arrived him being a
[1:20:39] prophet Behold the Lamb of
[1:20:42] God who takes away the sin of the
[1:20:47] world the prophet recognized the
[1:20:50] word because the
[1:20:53] lamb came with the
[1:20:57] purpose but before that purpose was was
[1:21:00] to be
[1:21:02] fulfilled that lamb first had to be
[1:21:05] washed that's the reason why he came to
[1:21:07] Jordan
[1:21:09] River he went straight to uh John the
[1:21:13] Baptist and John the Baptist being the
[1:21:17] prophet recognized that he was the Lamb
[1:21:19] of
[1:21:19] God and he said why do you come to
[1:21:23] me for for me to baptize
[1:21:26] you but I'm in need of you to baptize
[1:21:31] me but all the scriptures must be
[1:21:35] fulfilled and even the Lord Jesus
[1:21:38] Christ he who had no
[1:21:41] sin he also had to be
[1:21:45] baptized the lamb had to be
[1:21:48] cleansed and then after he was
[1:21:51] baptized the Dove came down
[1:21:56] which was the type of the Holy
[1:22:00] Spirit now in First
[1:22:16] Peter for as much as you know that you
[1:22:19] were not redeemed with corruptible
[1:22:21] things as silver and gold from your vain
[1:22:23] conversations received received by
[1:22:25] tradition from your
[1:22:28] fathers what what does the scripture say
[1:22:32] there that you were not
[1:22:37] redeemed because somebody paid a check
[1:22:39] for you with silver or
[1:22:42] gold or with a a a
[1:22:46] check because our bank
[1:22:49] accounts was too
[1:22:51] much our
[1:22:53] debt was too
[1:23:00] high no sufficient amount of gold or
[1:23:02] silver to be able to pay our
[1:23:05] de but we were
[1:23:09] purchased with the precious blood of
[1:23:11] Jesus
[1:23:12] Christ just like uh verse 19
[1:23:16] says but with the Precious Blood of lamb
[1:23:20] as of lamb without a
[1:23:21] blemish and without spot
[1:23:27] remember the laws that God gave to
[1:23:30] Moses that lamb must be without a
[1:23:35] blemish and so then we were never
[1:23:37] purchased with silver or
[1:23:40] gold but we were purchased with the
[1:23:42] precious blood of Jesus
[1:23:45] Christ and then when they took the Lord
[1:23:47] Jesus
[1:23:50] Christ they didn't take him because he
[1:23:52] committed
[1:23:53] adultery
[1:23:55] not because he broke the law not because
[1:23:57] he
[1:23:59] lied they wanted to crucify
[1:24:02] him because he had healed somebody on
[1:24:05] the
[1:24:08] Sabbath because he wanted to help
[1:24:11] someone on the
[1:24:14] Sabbath and the Lord told onto the
[1:24:19] Pharisees if there's a lamb out stuck in
[1:24:22] the
[1:24:23] Haywire
[1:24:25] uh or stuck on the ditch is because it's
[1:24:28] Sabbath you're not going to go and pluck
[1:24:29] them out I'm going to wait until
[1:24:32] tomorrow no let's go take him
[1:24:35] out that's the reason why they wanted to
[1:24:38] crucify
[1:24:39] him not because he had committed a
[1:24:43] sin but because he took our
[1:24:46] sins and then in Exodus
[1:24:53] 126
[1:24:55] and remember that the lamb was to be
[1:24:57] held until the 14th
[1:25:01] day and the Lord was kept held captive
[1:25:04] there for four
[1:25:09] days brother Brandon says that our Lord
[1:25:12] was there uh before the critics for four
[1:25:14] days and
[1:25:17] nights a perfect type of what had
[1:25:20] happened in
[1:25:22] Exodus to hold or keep keep that lamb
[1:25:25] for 4
[1:25:33] days uh and then in Exodus 126 it said
[1:25:36] that they were going to kill it between
[1:25:37] the two
[1:25:39] evenings and then in numbers
[1:25:47] 284 uh the one lamb Thou shalt offer in
[1:25:50] the morning and the other lamb shalt
[1:25:52] thou offer at eve even
[1:25:56] there's the two
[1:25:58] evenings so then in Matthew
[1:26:03] 271 when the morning was
[1:26:05] come it's morning
[1:26:15] time all the chief priests and Elders of
[1:26:18] the people took counsel against Jesus to
[1:26:20] put him to
[1:26:22] death they took him in the morning
[1:26:27] and then on the second verse it says
[1:26:28] when they had bound
[1:26:30] him they had him like a
[1:26:34] lamb they had bound him in the
[1:26:38] morning every scripture must be
[1:26:41] fulfilled that's the
[1:26:44] morning and then in Matthew
[1:26:51] 27:45 now from the sixth hour there was
[1:26:53] Darkness over all the land until the
[1:26:55] ninth
[1:26:59] hour now at that moment that's when the
[1:27:01] Lord had passed away at the n9th
[1:27:06] hour which typifies roughly between
[1:27:09] about uh 3 in the
[1:27:12] afternoon they took the Lord Jesus
[1:27:14] Christ as a type of the
[1:27:16] Lamb they took him in the
[1:27:18] morning and they bound him like a
[1:27:21] lamb and then he uh passed way in the
[1:27:26] afternoon fulfilling the
[1:27:31] scriptures and now the blam had to be
[1:27:33] without a blemish or a
[1:27:36] spot and then when Jesus was there
[1:27:38] chained
[1:27:41] up and pilate went to go speak with
[1:27:44] Jesus and he began to speak with
[1:27:49] him and then he came back and presented
[1:27:52] himself before all the congregation of
[1:27:53] Israel
[1:27:56] and pilate told all the
[1:27:58] Jews I find no fault in this
[1:28:03] man I find no fault in this
[1:28:06] man but the people of
[1:28:09] Israel still wanted to uh crucify
[1:28:16] him and they shouted let the blood of
[1:28:19] this man be upon us and our
[1:28:22] children but pilate wanted to wash his
[1:28:26] hands it's something very
[1:28:30] tremendous and then on John 19 uh 31
[1:28:39] 31 that's when Jesus had died at the
[1:28:44] cross uh the scripture says that that
[1:28:46] was the preparation of the uh
[1:28:51] Passover and nobody was to be uh hung on
[1:28:54] the
[1:28:56] cross or to stay there all
[1:29:01] night you can find that on Deuteronomy
[1:29:03] 21
[1:29:06] and22 that all the bodies that were
[1:29:08] crucified must come
[1:29:11] down and it was a perfect type of the
[1:29:15] Lamb that nothing must stay up
[1:29:19] there everything must
[1:29:21] be consumed and if it can't
[1:29:25] it must be
[1:29:28] burned and the Lamb of uh God should not
[1:29:31] be uh remained up in the in the
[1:29:34] cross every scripture must be
[1:29:38] fulfilled and then when they were at
[1:29:41] that point to take him
[1:29:44] down the soldiers told uh
[1:29:48] pilate let's break his
[1:29:50] bones of the men that are
[1:29:53] hanging they broke the bones of the
[1:29:55] first one and then of the
[1:29:58] second but then when they arrived un
[1:30:01] Jesus since they had already seen him
[1:30:04] dead they did not break his
[1:30:08] legs it was a perfect type of the
[1:30:12] Lamb just like it says in Exodus
[1:30:18] 12:46 that no bone must be
[1:30:22] broken all the scriptures must be
[1:30:26] fulfilled now this happened back in
[1:30:32] Egypt because a literal physical death
[1:30:34] was to
[1:30:36] come and the blood of that
[1:30:39] lamb was going to protect that
[1:30:43] home it was going to protect that
[1:30:45] firstborn
[1:30:50] son and all those scriptures had to be
[1:30:52] fulfilled to the DOT
[1:30:55] if there was a
[1:30:57] father had missed just a single word
[1:31:00] there was going to be
[1:31:03] death all the word must be
[1:31:06] fulfilled must be without any
[1:31:08] defect must be kept for four days must
[1:31:12] be eaten and if you can it must be
[1:31:17] burnt the bones must not be
[1:31:20] broken everything had to be
[1:31:22] fulfilled and then in this
[1:31:26] day we have received our
[1:31:29] lamb which is the Lord Jesus
[1:31:32] Christ and then in Hebrews 10
[1:31:38] 18 there is there no more offering for
[1:31:42] sin because
[1:31:45] annually the children of
[1:31:49] Israel had to fulfill these
[1:31:52] Feasts as a type of
[1:31:55] remembrance so that they would
[1:31:59] remember of what God did for their
[1:32:03] fathers because they did not see what
[1:32:05] had happened in
[1:32:08] Egypt their grandchildren didn't see
[1:32:12] Moses their great grandchildren didn't
[1:32:14] see all those
[1:32:17] Locust but it was just for a
[1:32:21] remembrance so that they would remember
[1:32:24] be able to tell the story that in this
[1:32:26] day that this
[1:32:29] month that the Lord took us out with a
[1:32:31] mighty
[1:32:33] hand from the house of slavery of
[1:32:36] Egypt he took your grandfather
[1:32:39] out he said you weren't
[1:32:41] there my son you weren't
[1:32:44] there but he took my father
[1:32:47] out I was just the child when
[1:32:50] that and when that grandchild
[1:32:54] he's going to tell his
[1:32:56] children what had happened in that
[1:32:59] day and that's why we read the
[1:33:02] scripture when your children shall ask
[1:33:06] what is this
[1:33:07] ritual why do we come to
[1:33:09] church on the
[1:33:12] Easter and you shall tell your children
[1:33:16] on this day on this
[1:33:18] month the Lord Jesus Christ the Lamb of
[1:33:22] God died for our
[1:33:27] sins I wasn't there when he died for
[1:33:30] us but time
[1:33:33] passed and here we are today fulfilling
[1:33:36] those
[1:33:38] feasts and that's what we're doing this
[1:33:43] morning and when the Lord was there on
[1:33:50] Earth death and the devil weren't
[1:33:52] completely convinced
[1:33:55] that he was truly the Son of God why is
[1:33:59] that because the Lord Jesus
[1:34:02] Christ was so
[1:34:04] humble he was just like any regular
[1:34:11] human and the devil questioned himself
[1:34:13] is he really the one that was
[1:34:15] propes because the devil knows the
[1:34:19] Bible he knew that the Virgin shall
[1:34:22] conceive
[1:34:25] but then there was a rumor that
[1:34:27] was that there was a virgin that
[1:34:30] conceived and he said that this one
[1:34:32] doesn't really look like it because if
[1:34:34] truly he was
[1:34:36] him why doesn't he look like a
[1:34:39] king he doesn't look like a
[1:34:43] king he looks like any regular
[1:34:46] old a regular
[1:34:49] person he appeared as a
[1:34:52] lamb blessed be the name of the
[1:34:55] Lord that's why when a wolf
[1:35:00] comes and the Wolf is seeing where the
[1:35:02] pastor is
[1:35:04] at because he wants to eat the
[1:35:10] Lambs looks like a
[1:35:12] lamb speaks like a
[1:35:14] lamb and when the wolf
[1:35:17] comes he has no idea who the pastor
[1:35:21] is and that's the same thing with
[1:35:25] he was so
[1:35:27] humble that the devil didn't even know
[1:35:29] who he
[1:35:32] was so then the devil came to tempt
[1:35:36] him if you're truly the Son of God if
[1:35:39] you
[1:35:41] are turn these stones into
[1:35:44] bread Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy
[1:35:49] God because not only by Bread
[1:35:52] lives
[1:35:54] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[1:35:56] the mouth of
[1:35:59] God and so then the devil took him up to
[1:36:02] the highest peak of the city and he said
[1:36:04] if you surrender unto
[1:36:06] me all these
[1:36:08] nations all this land shall be
[1:36:11] yours and he said get thee
[1:36:14] behind because he knows the
[1:36:20] scripture he said that no uh the would
[1:36:24] he would send his angels that his son
[1:36:25] shall not trle one of one of his toes
[1:36:29] one of his
[1:36:31] toes and he said
[1:36:35] no even the Lord was tempted with all
[1:36:37] the
[1:36:39] riches but then when the crucifixion
[1:36:44] arrived we see when that evening
[1:36:48] came he began to
[1:36:51] pray and he he began to say Lord your
[1:36:55] will may this cup pass over
[1:36:58] me but nonetheless let it not be my will
[1:37:02] but Let It Be Your
[1:37:04] Will because even though that the Lord
[1:37:06] was
[1:37:08] God he was in human
[1:37:11] flesh he felt the
[1:37:14] fear he didn't want to
[1:37:17] die that's the reason why he said Lord
[1:37:19] if it's your
[1:37:22] will may this cup pass over
[1:37:25] me but nonetheless let it not be my will
[1:37:29] but let thy will be
[1:37:33] done that's why uh the Lord was watching
[1:37:36] theil was watching the devil was
[1:37:38] watching the Lord
[1:37:41] pray and he said this man has
[1:37:45] fear this man has fear of
[1:37:48] dying this is not God because if he was
[1:37:52] God he would not fear
[1:37:54] it but he had no idea that it was
[1:37:58] God incarnated in human
[1:38:02] flesh God had a secret
[1:38:06] plan that the devil didn't even know the
[1:38:08] plan of
[1:38:11] God and when they took the lamb to the
[1:38:13] slaughter they began to to beat him they
[1:38:17] they uh St they
[1:38:20] spat and he said this is not God
[1:38:24] this is just another
[1:38:25] Prophet this is just another regular
[1:38:28] man and when he was on the
[1:38:31] cross and when he passed
[1:38:34] away death began to come
[1:38:37] near death
[1:38:42] became and death is something really
[1:38:44] strong to because
[1:38:47] death did have its
[1:38:50] power because when it was the time of
[1:38:52] Abraham death
[1:38:54] came and and jailed him when job
[1:38:58] Came Death took
[1:39:02] him when Daniel and Ezekiel and all the
[1:39:04] prophets came
[1:39:07] before death took all of the prophets
[1:39:10] away but then when the Lord
[1:39:13] came and death
[1:39:17] came put the Stinger into the
[1:39:20] Lord the Lord took it and he said
[1:39:24] death I shall be your
[1:39:27] death and then by that time death it was
[1:39:30] already too
[1:39:32] late because death had already uh gave
[1:39:35] out his thing and death
[1:39:38] said this man is not only just a
[1:39:42] Prophet this man is the pro is the Son
[1:39:44] of
[1:39:45] God I had I
[1:39:47] mistaken this is the child of
[1:39:52] God and so then now death has no more
[1:39:55] power and so then when he did die he
[1:39:59] went to
[1:40:00] hell and he began to knock on the door
[1:40:02] of the
[1:40:04] devil and he said that's the prophet
[1:40:06] that I've been waiting
[1:40:08] for and he said Satan I'm
[1:40:14] here give me the keys of hell and
[1:40:18] death he said you're the Son of God he
[1:40:22] said I am the son of God
[1:40:24] and then on that
[1:40:26] day the Lord Jesus
[1:40:29] Christ broke the backbone of
[1:40:34] Satan and he resurrected with the saints
[1:40:37] that were in
[1:40:38] paradise and now death has no more
[1:40:41] power the only thing that death
[1:40:45] does is to take you to your
[1:40:48] creator it's the only
[1:40:50] Power death has no more power
[1:40:54] to the
[1:40:55] Christian who has accepted this
[1:41:00] lamb and then after this lamb has been
[1:41:04] accepted and everything has been
[1:41:08] consumed then the unleavened bread
[1:41:12] come which is a type of the
[1:41:15] communion to live a holy and clean
[1:41:19] life
[1:41:22] separated after receiving the Lamb of
[1:41:25] God because it's not just to receive
[1:41:29] him and then go out and live any
[1:41:31] lifestyle that you
[1:41:33] wish I'm going to tell you once
[1:41:36] again it's not just accepting the Lord
[1:41:38] Jesus
[1:41:40] Christ and then start to live the life
[1:41:42] that I want to
[1:41:45] live no there's a certain style of life
[1:41:47] that
[1:41:49] must fruits are
[1:41:52] required
[1:41:55] and there's a certain lifestyle that
[1:41:56] must be brought forth after you've
[1:41:57] accepted
[1:41:59] it in First Corinthians
[1:42:02] 5:7 it says like
[1:42:07] this perched out therefore the old
[1:42:11] leaven that ye may be a new
[1:42:14] lump as ye are
[1:42:18] unleavened for even Christ Our
[1:42:22] Passover is sacrific for
[1:42:24] us because our
[1:42:27] Passover is
[1:42:30] Christ which was sacrificed for
[1:42:35] us our Lord Jesus Christ is our
[1:42:41] Passover we no longer have to take a
[1:42:44] lamb like they did back in the old
[1:42:48] days because the Lord Jesus Christ did
[1:42:50] that for us
[1:42:51] already the Lord Jesus Christ is our
[1:42:57] Passover and so therefore we uh
[1:42:59] celebrate the
[1:43:01] Feast not with old
[1:43:04] leaven Nei neither with leaven of malice
[1:43:07] and
[1:43:09] wickedness but with unleavened
[1:43:12] bread of
[1:43:14] sincerity and Truth amen
[1:43:19] amen those breads or the that life that
[1:43:22] we must live
[1:43:24] must be
[1:43:25] sincere and it must be of
[1:43:28] Truth and if and if it's not that
[1:43:32] way then we have a leaven
[1:43:37] life we must live a life worthy of the
[1:43:41] Gospel of sincerity and
[1:43:44] truth and then in Exodus
[1:43:52] 12:19
[1:43:53] seven days shall there be no leaven
[1:43:55] found in your
[1:43:58] house in your
[1:44:02] houses what is it that we speak about in
[1:44:04] our houses what is it that we do in our
[1:44:07] houses there must be sincerity there
[1:44:10] must be
[1:44:12] truth in our
[1:44:15] homes blessed be the name of the
[1:44:20] Lord every word must be fulfilled
[1:44:24] this
[1:44:26] Feast must be brought up to the
[1:44:31] dot that we must be living this life to
[1:44:33] every
[1:44:34] word and if we take just a single word
[1:44:37] out it's
[1:44:42] death the scripture says that there must
[1:44:44] be no leav found in your
[1:44:47] houses and what is it that we do in our
[1:44:49] own
[1:44:51] homes what is it that you speak speak
[1:44:53] about in your own
[1:44:54] homes what do you say in your homes is
[1:44:57] there
[1:44:59] leaven is there sincerity and
[1:45:03] TR because in this day of Passover must
[1:45:06] be unle must be
[1:45:09] cleaned it's not just the Holy Week but
[1:45:13] every
[1:45:14] week every
[1:45:16] week every single
[1:45:18] day not just because it's the Passover
[1:45:21] week I'm going to behave
[1:45:23] well forgive me for what I'm about to
[1:45:26] do I'm going to sanctify
[1:45:29] myself just like the the Catholic
[1:45:32] say no it's every single
[1:45:37] week in our
[1:45:40] homes the
[1:45:44] bread typifies Christ the
[1:45:49] word and then those seven days of eating
[1:45:51] that bread
[1:45:54] typifies the seven Church
[1:45:58] ages and and it says that it shall be
[1:46:01] with no
[1:46:04] leav don't add on to the word and don't
[1:46:07] take away from the
[1:46:09] word in our
[1:46:12] homes what is it that you say in your
[1:46:21] house do you add or take away once you
[1:46:25] start speaking about the word in your
[1:46:28] home you have to eat this bread in your
[1:46:33] home and in this
[1:46:35] month we celebrate the
[1:46:38] Redemption uh bread without
[1:46:41] leavon and uh the first
[1:46:44] fruits we have accepted that Lamb of
[1:46:50] God this bread of God without Le
[1:46:54] we're not going to take away or add to
[1:46:57] it we want to fulfill the
[1:47:00] scriptures because that bread has no
[1:47:04] taste that bread does not have any kind
[1:47:06] of
[1:47:07] sugar It's s such a simple
[1:47:11] bread for those that have taken the
[1:47:14] communion you know what I'm talking
[1:47:16] about it's there's no there's no salt to
[1:47:20] it it's just a simple bread
[1:47:24] because the
[1:47:25] lamb the Lord Jesus
[1:47:27] Christ is very
[1:47:30] simple he has no
[1:47:33] sugar he has no
[1:47:35] salt he's just a simple
[1:47:39] bread and since bread is sometimes very
[1:47:42] simple we want to dip it into the
[1:47:45] coffee so that we can give it a little
[1:47:46] bit of taste but the
[1:47:50] word must be eaten just the way it is
[1:47:53] is bread without
[1:48:00] leav and if the children of Israel had
[1:48:02] failed just one word it was
[1:48:06] death are you following
[1:48:09] me we're on our route to some place
[1:48:12] don't get
[1:48:14] lost now it's a divine
[1:48:17] order Redemption
[1:48:19] Passover the
[1:48:21] lamb
[1:48:23] to eat the bread un
[1:48:26] leaven to uh live a a life uh
[1:48:30] holy after leaving
[1:48:32] here that we continue to be
[1:48:35] Christians uh when it comes to be
[1:48:38] Tuesday and we continue to be a
[1:48:41] Christian until the next
[1:48:43] month we continue to be a
[1:48:45] Christian how many can say Amen unto
[1:48:48] that until the month of
[1:48:51] July let's continue being
[1:48:54] Christians when the month of August
[1:48:56] comes let's continue to be a
[1:48:59] Christian when the September month comes
[1:49:03] oh right there we can just take a break
[1:49:06] no let's live a holy
[1:49:10] life even after eating this
[1:49:14] lamb and then the third thing
[1:49:17] comes which is the Harvest of The
[1:49:20] Barley the first fruits
[1:49:26] remember that happens between the month
[1:49:27] of April and
[1:49:31] May and we believe in a
[1:49:35] resurrection and we're waiting for a
[1:49:39] resurrection and to be part of that
[1:49:43] Resurrection we must first accept the
[1:49:45] Lord Jesus
[1:49:46] Christ take that
[1:49:49] lamb and live this word
[1:49:54] and also mature along with this
[1:49:57] word because the
[1:49:59] lamb the
[1:50:01] prophet came to the
[1:50:06] word and we're waiting for that
[1:50:12] Resurrection in the old scripture
[1:50:15] times biblical no
[1:50:19] me she found herself with
[1:50:21] Boaz
[1:50:23] in the Harvest of the
[1:50:27] barley and brother B says that she
[1:50:29] arrived at the perfect
[1:50:31] time she found herself with her Redeemer
[1:50:35] with
[1:50:36] Boaz in the time of the
[1:50:41] Harvest Ruth and Boaz was the Redeemer
[1:50:44] of
[1:50:45] Ruth Ruth and Boaz got married with
[1:50:50] Ruth in the time of the Harvest
[1:50:53] of the
[1:50:56] barley and that's what we're waiting for
[1:50:58] in this
[1:50:59] day that Our
[1:51:02] Redeemer returns once
[1:51:05] again that we will marry with him but in
[1:51:09] this day the
[1:51:11] bride is getting married with the
[1:51:14] word she's accepting the
[1:51:18] word because we're waiting for that
[1:51:20] Harvest Time and in that Harvest
[1:51:24] Time that
[1:51:26] grain has already
[1:51:30] matured and it's ready to be
[1:51:35] plucked and the Harvest must be
[1:51:39] ready and we're talking about the
[1:51:42] individual and now when you see a
[1:51:46] wheat when you see a wheat that's just
[1:51:48] standing up straight it's not ready it's
[1:51:52] not
[1:51:53] enough because he's still with his head
[1:51:56] on
[1:51:57] high he has his chin up
[1:52:00] high because he's thinking that he knows
[1:52:04] everything but then when the wheat
[1:52:06] begins to
[1:52:08] mature it begins to bow
[1:52:11] down because he
[1:52:13] knows that he doesn't know everything he
[1:52:17] knows that he can't save
[1:52:20] himself a mature
[1:52:23] weat always bow his
[1:52:27] head and that's the reason why the Lord
[1:52:30] Jesus
[1:52:31] comes to pluck up the
[1:52:35] Harvest not to pick up those that
[1:52:40] are but those that are matured and have
[1:52:42] the Grain in
[1:52:45] them and we're waiting for the
[1:52:47] resurrection of the
[1:52:51] Dead when we see that the Lord Jesus
[1:52:53] Christ first
[1:52:54] rose that's scriptural that's
[1:52:58] biblical and then after
[1:53:00] him the Saints
[1:53:05] Rose now I don't know who was the one
[1:53:07] that rose right after
[1:53:09] Jesus I don't know who it
[1:53:14] was but brother brandham kind of always
[1:53:17] seems to say the same
[1:53:21] thing he said says that after Jesus rose
[1:53:23] Abraham rose
[1:53:25] up and then the
[1:53:27] rest and if you go searching for
[1:53:29] different
[1:53:30] quotes the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:53:32] Rose and then
[1:53:36] Abraham and I asked myself why was it
[1:53:40] that and it doesn't say that it's thus
[1:53:42] say the Lord say the Lord yeah don't
[1:53:44] take
[1:53:46] it don't take it as a doctrine that I'm
[1:53:48] trying to put
[1:53:51] forth that's just a quote that I'm
[1:53:53] sharing with
[1:53:54] you he says that Abraham rose right
[1:53:57] after
[1:53:59] Jesus
[1:54:02] H Willam Bram and in this day we have
[1:54:06] received William Mariam
[1:54:08] Branham H
[1:54:11] am the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:54:14] Rose and then
[1:54:18] Abraham now it doesn't say that he was
[1:54:20] the second one
[1:54:23] but that's how the prophet says
[1:54:26] it and we are also waiting for that
[1:54:30] Resurrection in
[1:54:32] the and I believe with all my
[1:54:35] heart just as the scripture
[1:54:37] says that the last shall be
[1:54:43] first and the last messenger of this age
[1:54:47] Bram his last name is uh
[1:54:51] Bram
[1:54:54] if you wish to accept it or reject it
[1:54:56] it's all up to
[1:54:57] you but we are waiting for that
[1:55:02] resurrection and with that resurrection
[1:55:04] of the Dead there will be a
[1:55:08] Rapture and to in order to be in that
[1:55:11] rapture we must be
[1:55:15] ready we have to accept the Lord Jesus
[1:55:19] Christ we must eat this word of the Lord
[1:55:24] and live a worthy life of the
[1:55:27] gospel and be ready for that
[1:55:30] day just as our Pastor said this
[1:55:36] morning this could be the first day of
[1:55:38] the
[1:55:39] Resurrection we don't
[1:55:42] know but the prophet said that it will
[1:55:44] be a
[1:55:45] secret it won't be a
[1:55:49] chaos people think that the Rapture will
[1:55:51] be a chaos
[1:55:53] it's going to be a
[1:55:55] secret and life will continue
[1:55:57] on people will continue to go to
[1:56:03] work and those who think that they're
[1:56:05] going to go into the Rapture they don't
[1:56:06] go let's stay
[1:56:09] humble let's stay
[1:56:12] prepared and let's accept this
[1:56:16] word because there's going to be many
[1:56:18] surprises on that
[1:56:20] day that's what the Bible and the
[1:56:22] messenger
[1:56:25] say that a life worthy of the Gospel is
[1:56:30] required and may the Lord have mercy on
[1:56:34] us because we're coming close to that
[1:56:41] day and perhaps today might be the
[1:56:43] beginning of those
[1:56:45] days they're going to knock on the
[1:56:48] door they're going to walk through the
[1:56:51] walls that's all
[1:56:53] biblical the Lord Jesus
[1:56:56] Christ after he
[1:56:59] rose he said do you have something to
[1:57:03] eat bring me a
[1:57:06] fish a cooked fish cook
[1:57:09] fish he didn't want a raw
[1:57:12] fish he wanted a cooked
[1:57:17] fish he ate a fish uh before he rose up
[1:57:22] and
[1:57:23] so let's wait for that
[1:57:27] day when those beloved return for those
[1:57:30] that we've been
[1:57:32] waiting and when that
[1:57:34] happens then the rapturing faith will
[1:57:37] come in that is going to
[1:57:40] come when our beloved loved
[1:57:44] ones and forgive me for what I'm about
[1:57:47] to
[1:57:47] say when our
[1:57:50] sister sees brother
[1:57:56] come can you make me those beans that I
[1:57:58] really
[1:57:59] love that coffee that I really
[1:58:02] enjoyed
[1:58:06] amen and then at that moment our sister
[1:58:09] o will no longer be an elderly she will
[1:58:12] be a young woman
[1:58:14] again I put her as an
[1:58:17] example because we have a lot of trust
[1:58:19] with one
[1:58:20] another now our sister
[1:58:23] we won't recognize
[1:58:25] her she will be a young lady
[1:58:28] again she will be
[1:58:31] young and that's what we're waiting
[1:58:36] for and the devil wants to take our
[1:58:38] vision away
[1:58:41] from but we're waiting for the
[1:58:43] resurrection of the
[1:58:44] dead and those that are ready will be
[1:58:49] there but it will be a secret
[1:58:52] not everybody was going to see
[1:58:55] it brother Johnny is going to rise
[1:58:59] up and brother Johnny really loved the
[1:59:03] hamburgers he didn't really like
[1:59:05] menudo he loved the
[1:59:07] hamburgers so then let's get
[1:59:10] ready and my question to you this
[1:59:12] morning
[1:59:13] is do you want to be
[1:59:16] there well you have to fight every
[1:59:19] inch just as the Apostle Paul said
[1:59:23] I have fought the good
[1:59:25] fight when he said the good
[1:59:28] fight that tells
[1:59:30] me that there is a bad
[1:59:34] battle there's an incorrect
[1:59:37] battle so then what are you fighting
[1:59:39] this
[1:59:42] morning I'm not trying to fight to stay
[1:59:44] as an associate
[1:59:46] pastor you can stay with that title
[1:59:49] here you can stay with the church here
[1:59:53] and you can stay with my house if you
[1:59:55] like to but I will not stay
[1:59:58] here if you want this
[2:00:00] Tabernacle you can stay with the
[2:00:03] Tabernacle if you want the title of an
[2:00:05] associate
[2:00:06] pastor then you can have
[2:00:09] it but I'm going with the Lord Jesus
[2:00:13] Christ so then what are you fighting for
[2:00:15] this morning are you fighting with your
[2:00:18] brother let's fight the good battle may
[2:00:22] the Lord help us may the Lord forgive
[2:00:26] us with that Holy Blood of the
[2:00:29] Lord because that lamb is already been
[2:00:33] slain he's already been
[2:00:36] slain and that Easter lamb is already at
[2:00:40] the
[2:00:41] cross our
[2:00:45] Easter I'm closing
[2:00:48] now in Exodus
[2:00:50] 12:7
[2:00:55] and with the blood of the
[2:00:58] Lamb shall strike it on the two
[2:01:01] posts and on the upper post of the
[2:01:05] houses how many can you say Amen unto
[2:01:08] that
[2:01:11] okay I'm going to ask you a little bit
[2:01:14] later on if you're still going to say
[2:01:18] Amen but remember it was a commandment
[2:01:23] from God to
[2:01:24] Moses and from Moses to the
[2:01:27] people of what they must
[2:01:31] do and he said with that
[2:01:35] blood you shall take the
[2:01:37] hup it's just a common
[2:01:42] weed and you're going to dip it into
[2:01:45] blood you're going to put on side post
[2:01:48] of the
[2:01:49] house and on the upper door post of the
[2:01:52] house because on this
[2:01:55] night the angel of
[2:01:57] death is going to hit
[2:02:01] Egypt and on this
[2:02:04] day it won't be any physical
[2:02:07] death it will be a spiritual death I'm
[2:02:11] going to say it
[2:02:12] again it will not be a literal death it
[2:02:15] will be a phys uh spiritual
[2:02:19] deatha the housea
[2:02:24] in that house there is a
[2:02:25] door and on the door there's two
[2:02:28] side and a
[2:02:29] lentil and my question to you
[2:02:33] is the Lord came down and told
[2:02:36] me what are those two side
[2:02:39] posts and I said
[2:02:41] Lord It's the husband and the
[2:02:47] wife and the Lord said you're
[2:02:50] right
[2:02:53] and then I went to go search it out into
[2:02:54] the message and the prophet says the
[2:02:59] lentil that typifies a
[2:03:02] cross there's the
[2:03:04] door the two posts and lentil you're
[2:03:08] going to put blood on all three but not
[2:03:11] on the floor not on the
[2:03:15] ground because the blood must not be
[2:03:17] trampled
[2:03:18] on it must not be
[2:03:20] trampled and those two
[2:03:23] post mother and
[2:03:25] father blessed be the name of the
[2:03:30] Lord in order to have a strong
[2:03:33] Church it requires to have strong
[2:03:35] families I'm going to say it
[2:03:38] again in order to have a strong
[2:03:41] church we require families that
[2:03:45] are I'm going to say it
[2:03:48] again in order to have a strong
[2:03:50] Church it requires a families that
[2:03:54] are it requires that mother and
[2:03:57] father stay in the word and
[2:04:00] [Applause]
[2:04:02] brothers we are living in the end
[2:04:05] time there will be spiritual
[2:04:08] death if Mother and
[2:04:12] Father they must be covered in
[2:04:15] blood they must be submerged in
[2:04:19] blood it's a triangle it's a
[2:04:23] pyramid the husband and wife and the
[2:04:25] Lord Jesus
[2:04:29] Christ
[2:04:31] amen it's tremendous
[2:04:37] amen was it Moses's
[2:04:40] fault if a son died
[2:04:46] no it was a commandment from
[2:04:49] God to Moses
[2:04:54] and then the responsibility of Moses to
[2:04:56] say
[2:04:59] it his job was only to say
[2:05:02] it exactly the way that God said
[2:05:05] it if Moses failed at
[2:05:08] it and then that's between him and God
[2:05:11] but then now it was
[2:05:13] Moses unto the
[2:05:17] parents and the Bible says unto the
[2:05:20] priests who the
[2:05:24] priests the parents of the home no no no
[2:05:28] the the boss the bosses of the
[2:05:30] home the
[2:05:32] Father the
[2:05:34] father is The Shepherd of the
[2:05:37] home
[2:05:41] amen Moses told unto the priest of
[2:05:45] Israel Moses never told the wife to the
[2:05:48] motherinlaw to
[2:05:50] the
[2:05:53] but no he told it to the pastors of
[2:05:55] every
[2:05:56] home there's going to be death better
[2:05:59] grab the
[2:06:00] blood on the both posts and the
[2:06:05] lentil it must be submerged in
[2:06:09] Blood of mother and
[2:06:11] father they must be covered in the
[2:06:15] blood so is it the pastor's fault of the
[2:06:18] Prophet
[2:06:20] no we have the
[2:06:23] word and now the responsibility is in
[2:06:26] our
[2:06:28] hands there will be spiritual
[2:06:32] death that's why the prophet
[2:06:34] says it's not the ministry's
[2:06:37] fault if the young people don't want to
[2:06:39] come to
[2:06:42] church you parents must bring your young
[2:06:45] children you must bring your children to
[2:06:48] church bring them to
[2:06:50] Christ
[2:06:55] and it says apply the
[2:06:57] blood on the both
[2:07:00] posts I'm closing
[2:07:03] now if you wouldn't mind standing and
[2:07:05] the musicians come
[2:07:07] up and if the song leader can come up as
[2:07:10] well the prophet says like
[2:07:17] this but they stayed under the
[2:07:20] blood
[2:07:22] God said when you are under the
[2:07:24] blood stay there that's
[2:07:28] right and so then when they were there
[2:07:30] in the old
[2:07:33] times he said Moses put the blood on the
[2:07:36] post and don't come
[2:07:39] out don't come
[2:07:43] out not in and
[2:07:45] out in and
[2:07:48] out stay there
[2:07:52] and after a while it come
[2:07:57] midnight the Great Dark roaring Cloud
[2:07:59] come
[2:08:01] up I can look coming back there through
[2:08:07] yonder and I see two big black wings
[2:08:09] spread across the nation here it comes
[2:08:13] will you put that slide for me brother
[2:08:16] sister the first
[2:08:19] one it says uh here it
[2:08:23] comes I can
[2:08:26] hear the priest of the
[2:08:29] family the
[2:08:34] father who is the priest of the
[2:08:36] family the pastor of the family the
[2:08:41] Father the father is the
[2:08:43] pastor
[2:08:48] amen and so then it falls on the laot of
[2:08:50] the pastor of every family
[2:08:53] to fulfill these
[2:08:56] Scriptures it wasn't Moses it was the
[2:09:00] pastor it was the pastor of that
[2:09:04] home I can hear the father
[2:09:09] say there is the death angel sweeping
[2:09:11] the land
[2:09:13] now too late
[2:09:17] now and directly I can see him go dip
[2:09:20] down into the valley
[2:09:23] hear a scream come up from the
[2:09:25] house the son is dead he's
[2:09:30] gone directly here he
[2:09:32] comes and then again onto another house
[2:09:36] go
[2:09:39] in the big black wings close around the
[2:09:43] house a scream comes
[2:09:45] up the son is
[2:09:49] dead I can hear the little boy say
[2:09:52] notice
[2:09:53] this that even the
[2:09:56] children their own
[2:09:58] children say unto their fathers
[2:10:02] daddy take another
[2:10:05] look be
[2:10:08] sure the blood's on
[2:10:11] there and the the child was
[2:10:15] fearful because
[2:10:16] literally you can hear
[2:10:19] screams and the child was saying in that
[2:10:23] home my my my friend Miguel used to live
[2:10:26] there he's dead now we could hear his
[2:10:30] scream and then in this house we
[2:10:33] have and his father didn't apply the
[2:10:35] blood onto the PO I used to play with
[2:10:39] Him Father please make
[2:10:41] sure that there's blood on the post and
[2:10:45] brother
[2:10:46] BR would say that the
[2:10:48] son would grab onto the garments of the
[2:10:53] he say father make sure
[2:10:55] please because the son
[2:10:57] knew because father was going to die
[2:11:00] Mother wasn't going to die who was going
[2:11:02] to die was the first
[2:11:04] born it is not
[2:11:07] juvenquency it is the delinquency of the
[2:11:10] parents and the poor child and
[2:11:14] tears grabbing under the garments of the
[2:11:17] father father please make sure that
[2:11:20] we're ready

[2:11:23] pastor please make
[2:11:25] sure because if you don't I will
[2:11:29] die not
[2:11:32] naturally
[2:11:36] spiritually amen and the
[2:11:42] prophet I tell you if ever was a
[2:11:46] time a man ought to be examining
[2:11:49] himself is right
