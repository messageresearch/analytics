[1:00:03] [Music]
[1:00:33] in the name of jesus christ amen amen
[1:00:39] it's like we're standing we can go to
[1:00:40] the book of joshua el capitolo says
[1:00:42] the sixth chapter
[1:00:46] starting from the first verse
[1:00:49] i'm going to read all the way to the
[1:00:50] ninth
[1:00:54] mendica
[1:01:04] [Music]
[1:01:06] the word of god says now jericho was
[1:01:08] straightly shut up because of the
[1:01:09] children of israel none went out and
[1:01:11] none came in
[1:01:19] the lord joshua see i have given into
[1:01:22] thine hand jericho in the king thereof
[1:01:24] and the mighty men of valor
[1:01:35] city and yeah men of war go around about
[1:01:37] the city once thou shall
[1:01:39] thou do six days
[1:01:52] and seven priests shall bear before the
[1:01:54] ark seven trumpets of ram horns on the
[1:01:56] seventh day you should come past the
[1:01:58] city seven times and the prey shall blow
[1:02:00] with the trumpets
[1:02:15] it should come to pass that when they
[1:02:16] make a long blast with the ram's horn
[1:02:18] when you hear the sound of the trumpet
[1:02:20] all the people shall shout with a great
[1:02:22] shout and the wall of the city shall
[1:02:23] fall down flat and the people shall
[1:02:25] ascend up every man straight before him
[1:02:28] jose
[1:02:30] is
[1:02:38] [Music]
[1:02:40] the priest and said unto him take up the
[1:02:41] ark of covenant and let seven priests
[1:02:43] bear seven trumpets of ram horns before
[1:02:45] the ark of the lord
[1:02:56] and let him let his arm pass before the
[1:02:57] ark of the lord
[1:03:12] it came to pass when joshua had spoken
[1:03:14] unto the people that the seven priests
[1:03:16] bring the seven trepid rammed horns
[1:03:17] passed on before the lord and blew with
[1:03:19] the trumpets and the ark of the covenant
[1:03:20] of the lord followed them
[1:03:32] and the armed men went before the
[1:03:34] priests that blew with the trumpets and
[1:03:35] the and the reward came after the ark
[1:03:37] and the priests going on and blowing
[1:03:39] with the trumpets
[1:04:07] that's opening up more and more
[1:04:25] a quote
[1:04:27] a message of paradox
[1:04:34] joshua here is a book actually it's a
[1:04:37] book of redemption
[1:05:32] because redemption has two parts
[1:05:46] it takes two parts to make a redemption
[1:05:48] out of in 2.
[1:05:54] moses represented the law which brought
[1:05:55] them out of egypt
[1:06:01] and whereas joshua represented grace
[1:06:02] that took him into the promised land
[1:06:07] aspects diferentes
[1:06:10] otherwise the law and grace were two
[1:06:11] different aspects of god's command
[1:06:15] now with through moses took them out
[1:06:20] and joshua brought him in
[1:06:24] as we read
[1:06:28] the gates of this city las puertas
[1:06:41] but god gave them a way to opposition to
[1:06:44] open them up
[1:06:48] see the message is in the bible
[1:06:51] many people fail in tomorrow
[1:06:54] and taking what brother branham says
[1:06:58] and applying it through the whole bible
[1:07:01] what happened with joshua
[1:07:04] it also happened to us
[1:07:10] there were six days that they had to go
[1:07:12] out around the city
[1:07:14] but on the seventh day
[1:07:19] seven times they went around the city
[1:07:23] now those gates of those cities were
[1:07:25] sealed
[1:07:26] for work
[1:07:40] if you read the book of joshua
[1:07:44] it's uh it's a massacre
[1:07:49] it's a massacre what he did with
[1:07:50] everybody there
[1:07:55] why is joshua that tough for that rood
[1:07:58] you have to see the type
[1:08:01] and what joshua's doing
[1:08:03] jesus is a type of cro of jesus
[1:08:19] because first of all first she heard the
[1:08:20] trumpet
[1:08:22] not of the seven
[1:08:34] and she said unto them i know the lord
[1:08:36] hath given you the land
[1:08:40] and that your terror has fallen upon us
[1:08:46] and that all the inhabitants of the land
[1:08:48] faint because of you
[1:08:55] how the lord dried up the water of the
[1:08:57] red sea for you
[1:09:00] when you came out of egypt
[1:09:05] and what you did unto the two kings of
[1:09:06] the amorites
[1:09:08] of jordan they were on the other side of
[1:09:10] jordan
[1:09:14] and og who we utterly destroyed entonces
[1:09:19] the ones who lived in jericho
[1:09:22] just like rehab
[1:09:24] they heard lo quedios
[1:09:27] of what god has done
[1:09:30] that's why it's necessary to preach the
[1:09:31] gospel
[1:10:00] rahab's attitude
[1:10:03] and verse 11 says
[1:10:07] and as soon as we heard these things our
[1:10:09] hearts did melt
[1:10:12] in
[1:10:28] now therefore i pray i swear it unto me
[1:10:30] by the lord
[1:10:34] since i have showed you kindness
[1:10:39] that you should also show kindness onto
[1:10:40] my father's house
[1:11:24] and
[1:11:49] and it shall be when the lord has given
[1:11:50] us the land that it will deal kindly and
[1:11:52] truly with thee entonces
[1:11:56] so rahab heard the trumpet of the gospel
[1:12:01] and the reason for that
[1:12:03] regardless if she was a sinner
[1:12:06] she made a
[1:12:48] or open
[1:13:03] jehovah's savior
[1:13:06] so does jesus mean jehovah's savior
[1:13:11] when joshua was before the walls of
[1:13:13] jericho
[1:13:14] jesus it is a type of jesus josue
[1:13:21] joshua was true to the token sign that
[1:13:23] his messengers had preached
[1:13:29] so will jesus be true to the token sign
[1:13:31] that his messengers preach
[1:13:34] when he comes
[1:13:37] all under it was saved
[1:13:39] in egypt
[1:13:42] all under it was saved in
[1:13:44] jericho
[1:13:50] we found out the lamb's blood was the
[1:13:51] type of jesus christ movie in all right
[1:13:55] in hebrews 13.
[1:13:58] we find this and it's called their el
[1:14:00] pacto eterno the everlasting covenant
[1:14:06] so when rahab asked mercy to be shown
[1:14:08] upon her el sombras
[1:14:11] the man gave her a sign
[1:14:15] and that token is a type of the blood
[1:14:20] it's a covenant that she made with these
[1:14:21] men
[1:14:23] that's why the blood of jesus christ is
[1:14:26] it is
[1:14:40] but the blood now is an everlasting
[1:14:41] covenant
[1:14:43] the blood of jesus christ
[1:14:47] is a type of us
[1:14:50] in our contaminated condition
[1:14:54] we hear
[1:15:07] that message gives us life
[1:15:41] and the seven priests shall bear before
[1:15:42] they are there are seven trumpets of ram
[1:15:44] horns
[1:15:45] and the seventh day you should compass
[1:15:47] the city seven times
[1:16:46] this has a lot to do with what happened
[1:16:48] with brother branham
[1:16:51] we see the message is throughout the
[1:16:52] whole bible
[1:16:56] one key that the prophet has given us
[1:17:00] the revelation of god
[1:17:14] what happened with
[1:17:57] i used to think that brother ramos
[1:17:58] raptured on the 28th of february
[1:18:04] the brown was not even in arizona when
[1:18:06] that happened
[1:18:08] in fact he preached the message
[1:18:10] the absolute in tejas in texas
[1:18:18] had legal problems with his son
[1:18:22] now there's also a controversy
[1:18:24] or
[1:18:38] the majority
[1:18:47] but there's a doubt that exists whether
[1:18:48] it was the 7th or the 8th of march
[1:18:53] and i asked myself what is it why can't
[1:18:55] we have a exact date
[1:19:00] of jesus
[1:19:04] in matthew 17 1. jesus
[1:19:25] after six days jesus takes peter james
[1:19:27] and john his brother and bringing them
[1:19:29] up into a high mountain apart in marcos
[1:19:32] and mark 9 2
[1:19:34] it speaks
[1:19:44] after six days jesus said to him peter
[1:19:46] james and john and lead them up into a
[1:19:48] high mountain part by themselves
[1:19:52] so matthew and mark speak that it was
[1:19:54] six days
[1:19:55] yes after the six days
[1:19:59] but luke 9 28.
[1:20:02] diaz
[1:20:05] it says it came to pass about eight days
[1:20:07] after these things
[1:20:13] he took peter james and john's into a
[1:20:15] mountain to pray
[1:20:31] went to the mount transfiguration
[1:20:35] about six eight days after
[1:20:38] representation
[1:20:39] so what does those men represent
[1:20:42] in the six days
[1:21:11] now there is another book of redemption
[1:21:13] in apocalypse
[1:21:15] in revelations 5 6.
[1:21:20] remember that john saw a book with seven
[1:21:22] seals
[1:21:24] but no one was ready to take up the book
[1:21:26] neither
[1:21:54] but to use the horn as a trumpet primero
[1:21:57] tienes que matar al animal first you
[1:21:59] have to kill that animal jesus
[1:22:01] and so then jesus was killed
[1:22:03] el cordero so here the the lamb
[1:22:06] in molado it seems to be
[1:22:21] sent forth onto all the earth
[1:22:26] you see the parallel between joshua and
[1:22:28] jesus josue joshua hombres seven men
[1:22:32] seven horns jesus
[1:22:34] jesus the lamb
[1:22:36] seven
[1:23:16] is
[1:23:20] because your name is on that book
[1:23:23] jesus is cordero now jesus is this lamb
[1:23:27] el es el carnero it is the realm
[1:23:45] [Music]
[1:23:48] and he was born under the ram aries
[1:23:50] jesus that's why jesus
[1:23:55] had been born in march in april like
[1:23:56] brother branham
[1:23:59] because it's zodiac signs
[1:24:14] and seven eyes
[1:24:28] joshua
[1:24:42] headstone
[1:24:45] and in this stone alone
[1:24:48] it is before joshua
[1:24:53] is not the same joshua
[1:24:56] before
[1:25:38] to restore the faith
[1:25:41] now this joshua
[1:25:43] is a high priest
[1:25:46] jesus just like the high priest jesus
[1:25:49] took the book
[1:26:11] for they who have despised the day of
[1:26:12] small things for they shall rejoice
[1:26:17] and shall see the plummet in the hand of
[1:26:19] zuribel
[1:26:37] the bridge between the seven church ages
[1:26:38] and the seven seals
[1:26:40] the prophet says
[1:26:44] seven horns with the seven church
[1:26:46] agencies
[1:26:51] because that was the lamb's protection
[1:26:56] while he protected his rights here on
[1:26:58] earth
[1:27:00] what he protected see los cuernos en el
[1:27:02] cordero
[1:27:43] [Music]
[1:27:45] i differentiate
[1:27:47] there are different ranks
[1:27:49] there are different levels
[1:27:51] of prophets
[1:27:57] says a preacher the testament of the new
[1:28:00] testament
[1:28:01] is categorized as a prophet
[1:28:05] but they're not on the same level
[1:28:08] that's why it says here prophets we say
[1:28:10] este cordero tiene si te cuernos
[1:28:13] here this lamb has seven horns
[1:28:16] and every horn has had an eye
[1:28:18] ojos seven eyes
[1:28:21] what is this christo is christ and his
[1:28:24] bride
[1:28:25] la sita
[1:28:54] so the last one
[1:29:04] he took the book of the right hand of
[1:29:05] him that set upon the throne
[1:29:07] who was it
[1:29:54] if you don't tie it with the whole bible
[1:29:57] then it's not right
[1:30:01] and it was on the seventh day pandora
[1:30:20] and they could pass a city in the same
[1:30:22] manner seven times
[1:30:26] only on that day they can pass the city
[1:30:28] seven times
[1:30:33] and i came to the past the seventh time
[1:30:34] when the priest blew the trumpets
[1:30:41] joshua unto the people shout for the
[1:30:43] lord hath given you the city
[1:31:00] they went around seven
[1:31:11] it says the lord hath given them the
[1:31:13] city
[1:31:14] application
[1:31:23] remember the constellation of the vision
[1:31:24] of the angels
[1:31:27] when i left here to go to arizona
[1:31:32] remember what time it is sirs
[1:31:39] notice there was only one great burst of
[1:31:41] thunder yeah
[1:31:55] they went around one time
[1:31:58] on the seventh day
[1:32:00] they went around seven times
[1:32:02] six church ages
[1:32:04] there was only one messenger pablo paul
[1:32:07] arenas martin martin colombo columbus
[1:32:10] luther
[1:32:37] just like joshua
[1:32:50] do you see the parallel
[1:33:06] you
[1:33:20] that was
[1:33:53] according to the purpose of him who
[1:33:54] would work with all things after the
[1:33:56] council of his own will
[1:34:00] that we should be in the praise of his
[1:34:01] glory nosotros
[1:34:08] [Music]
[1:35:26] now we are that
[1:36:49] [Music]
[1:37:42] jesus christ taking possession of the
[1:37:43] book
[1:37:46] now
[1:37:51] when he's in his meditorial work back
[1:37:53] there
[1:37:55] album
[1:38:00] redeeming but some days come come forth
[1:38:02] to get his book that he's redeemed
[1:38:07] and all that's in this book will be him
[1:38:12] for that's the believer
[1:38:28] you are that book
[1:38:31] because your name is there you know
[1:38:33] literally now it's not a literal book
[1:38:36] it's a book
[1:38:38] it's a word that's incarnated
[1:38:42] there's like a lot of things that were
[1:38:43] said
[1:38:44] as jesus and the reign of jesus
[1:38:47] when he got there to the land
[1:38:49] it was the word incarnated
[1:38:52] just like you have to be the word
[1:38:53] incarnated
[1:38:56] is
[1:39:13] whose names are written
[1:39:17] on the book before the foundation of the
[1:39:19] world
[1:39:23] when he was slain as a lamb
[1:40:06] you
[1:40:48] to surrender what he has
[1:40:53] he obtained illegally
[1:40:57] so he has no right for this possession
[1:41:01] but regardless it's in his hands
[1:41:18] is going to do a massacre
[1:41:24] what legally belongs to him
[1:41:28] this whole world belongs to him
[1:41:30] but
[1:41:33] [Music]
[1:41:43] and showed them all the kingdoms of the
[1:41:45] world
[1:41:48] the devil wanted to give it to him
[1:41:56] because jesus had to pay legally a price
[1:41:57] to obtain them
[1:42:10] he rejected the free offer diablo of the
[1:42:13] devil
[1:42:15] i will pay a price for it
[1:42:20] just like jesus paid a price for you
[1:42:39] but you're in the devil's hands but the
[1:42:42] day will come
[1:42:46] all the names of that book
[1:42:51] even though they're illegally in the
[1:42:52] possession of the devil's hands
[1:43:14] [Music]
[1:43:21] you belong to jesus
[1:44:04] wants
[1:44:06] worldwide
[1:44:08] is your life
[1:44:09] the day will come
[1:44:13] jesus will take legal possession of you
[1:44:17] you belong to him
[1:44:32] our kinsmen
[1:44:46] back to the original owner
[1:44:51] but there's been a poacher on the land
[1:44:54] um
[1:44:57] let me know what that is
[1:45:00] someone that comes
[1:45:14] land
[1:45:17] with adam and eve
[1:45:20] he did it illegally
[1:45:25] but god is not an illegal god
[1:45:27] he has a law yes
[1:45:37] is
[1:45:56] that's why even in the resurrection
[1:45:59] the 16 elements
[1:46:03] are required for you to go into the
[1:46:05] resurrection
[1:46:10] redeemed attribute de la tierra of the
[1:46:12] land
[1:46:13] this is
[1:46:15] this land belongs to god
[1:46:19] but he is a poacher um
[1:46:24] i could say something right here right
[1:46:26] now
[1:46:27] but i better not
[1:46:31] it is the title of our redemption
[1:46:38] it's the title
[1:47:06] it all
[1:47:18] he gives it back to the people
[1:47:35] don't want to give it right he doesn't
[1:47:37] want to give it up real quick
[1:47:40] we find out later in the scriptures
[1:47:44] i'm taking over here on another chapter
[1:47:48] he
[1:48:30] himself in his ministry
[1:48:33] he went around the world seven times
[1:48:40] in the message standing in the gap
[1:49:16] there will be a lot of things that will
[1:49:17] be misconstrued
[1:49:23] six ages
[1:49:26] every messenger has
[1:50:11] luther never organized it
[1:50:13] it was after luther
[1:50:15] wesley and then wesley came forth it is
[1:50:17] placed at wesley and after wesley
[1:50:19] iglesia wesleyan then they got the west
[1:50:21] wesleyan church logo juan smith and then
[1:50:24] after came john smith bautista the
[1:50:27] baptist
[1:50:28] alejandro campbell then alexander
[1:50:30] campbell et cetera and so forth
[1:50:33] but the man formed
[1:50:36] the reformers they didn't live long
[1:50:37] enough
[1:50:40] to get it all together
[1:50:46] and so a lot of loose ends are left
[1:50:50] so when
[1:53:35] when it took possession of all the
[1:53:37] kingdoms
[1:53:38] that were in
[1:53:52] the moon
[1:53:54] there was hell that came from him from
[1:53:56] the heavens
[1:53:57] so when jesus comes
[1:54:00] there's a sword that comes forward from
[1:54:02] his mouth
[1:54:03] and he's going to use that sword
[1:54:21] talked about guards
[1:54:24] of armies
[1:54:27] they were around those seven men
[1:54:30] in joshua six nine it says
[1:54:36] and the armed men went before the
[1:54:37] priests that blew with the trumpets
[1:54:42] and the reward came after the ark
[1:54:46] so there was an army
[1:54:48] that was before
[1:55:20] i talk about the different armies that
[1:55:21] israel had
[1:55:24] verse 14 it
[1:55:30] says in the first
[1:55:32] place when the standard of the camp of
[1:55:34] the children of judah according to their
[1:55:36] armies
[1:55:39] the first one that always marched
[1:55:44] marching
[1:56:33] and then the standard of the camp of the
[1:56:34] children of dan set forward
[1:56:54] is
[1:57:07] to understand this let's notice what
[1:57:08] brother brandon says
[1:57:14] now if we find in the studying of the
[1:57:15] revelation
[1:57:18] of the churches
[1:57:20] that one of them uh one of those
[1:57:22] creatures was a lion
[1:57:26] and the other one was a lion one would
[1:57:28] one the other was an ox
[1:57:32] and the other one was an ego ayamos
[1:57:35] de la
[1:57:50] in the wilderness
[1:57:55] i won't have time to go into it
[1:57:58] how would you jot it out here
[1:58:00] and they just showed just exactly
[1:58:03] they were watching over this el
[1:58:46] a tribal emblem
[1:58:50] which was a 4-12 tribe set cuatro
[1:58:53] catalado
[1:58:55] a catalan four on each side or three
[1:58:56] tribes on each side
[1:59:01] and the four beasts said and watch these
[1:59:03] tribes
[1:59:06] from all four ways
[1:59:09] and we see went to the gospels
[1:59:12] and we show it exactly
[1:59:27] on earth which was the holy spirit
[1:59:32] the blood had sent back to us the holy
[1:59:33] ghost
[1:59:38] and the four beasts represented the
[1:59:39] twelve tribes of israel
[1:59:42] there's 12 tribes
[2:00:04] [Music]
[2:00:24] on a watch
[2:00:27] what are four guards
[2:00:35] but if you see those guards
[2:00:38] the first one that goes is
[2:00:40] judah
[2:00:42] esta represented
[2:00:44] that represents the banner in the east
[2:00:49] because it's like it's like a time time
[2:00:51] piece a watch
[2:01:06] the key
[2:01:08] but yeah it goes from to the east to the
[2:01:10] south pores
[2:01:12] that's why it's like a timepiece
[2:01:16] because three tribes are appointed on
[2:01:18] the east threshes
[2:01:51] [Music]
[2:02:16] when israel was returned back to their
[2:02:17] homeland
[2:02:21] says the message of the beast and the
[2:02:22] soul of god
[2:02:26] if you want to see what day of the month
[2:02:27] it is
[2:02:40] see in the season that's the coming of
[2:02:41] the lord
[2:02:43] is
[2:03:40] prophet
[2:03:45] believers
[2:03:52] who want for you to reveal themselves
[2:03:54] you reveal yourself to them
[2:03:57] we ask you lord as eaglets
[2:04:01] may they eat the message
[2:04:04] of the bible lord preparation
[2:04:08] to prepare one day to have the strength
[2:04:09] so we are delighted to go up to to the
[2:04:12] air confederator with rapturing faith
[2:04:15] to go with you
[2:04:18] and then we should go to our homeland
[2:04:20] and through millennium to our millennium
[2:04:22] the pediments
[2:04:32] the name of jesus christ amen
