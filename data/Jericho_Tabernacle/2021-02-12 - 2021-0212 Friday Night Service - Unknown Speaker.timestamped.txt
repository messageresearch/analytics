[26:01] pasado and we'll talk about it a little
[26:03] bit this evening
[26:07] i grew up in the church yo christine
[26:10] iglesia a lot of you guys know i'm
[26:11] brother johnny's
[26:12] uh second to the last song
[26:17] i'm not the baby i'm almost the baby no
[26:20] soy el bevito pero ya casi so i got a
[26:23] little bit softer of my dad
[26:29] i got a different dad
[26:34] growing up my dad was
[26:50] married i had kids
[26:54] i was going to church eva iglesias song
[26:57] leading
[26:57] yo de gea los cantos serving the lord
[26:59] the best way that i thought that i could
[27:01] serbian
[27:01] senora mejor manera podia
[27:05] thought everything was okay
[27:10] what i didn't realize
[27:14] but the devil was going to hit me with
[27:16] something that i wouldn't expect
[27:22] believe the devil hit me with a gut
[27:23] punch
[27:32] it's not a hit that just kind of
[27:34] staggers you no
[27:35] no like maybe you lost your job
[27:41] or maybe you know you're you've got some
[27:43] uh
[27:44] troubles where you need something and
[27:46] you can't figure
[27:54] i think this was a gut punch that really
[27:57] took the air out of me
[28:01] and what it did is it it started messing
[28:04] with my mind
[28:11] in 2015 and
[28:15] my world that i thought was a perfect
[28:17] world ese mundo
[28:18] me okay yo pensa perfecto and i thought
[28:20] that i was serving god
[28:22] yo pence and i thought that i was doing
[28:24] everything that i could to please god
[28:26] [Music]
[28:29] the devil caused something in my life el
[28:31] diablo
[28:32] where i ended up getting divorced
[28:36] probably one of the they say one of the
[28:39] the bigger stressors of life
[28:54] there's a couple other ones but divorce
[28:57] cuantas pero divorcio
[29:00] there came a time in my life
[29:04] i didn't know what to do
[29:08] i felt like i was completely lost yo yo
[29:38] why did you serve god all your life
[29:41] why did you every time when your friends
[29:43] would go out and do something and drink
[29:45] and smoke and
[29:46] why did you hold back
[29:50] [Music]
[30:08] i started doing things that i had never
[30:10] done in my life
[30:14] you start drinking why
[30:18] because the devil has your mind so
[30:19] wrapped up el diablo
[30:34] i dragged myself through the mud lodo
[30:41] talking to my mom there was
[30:45] one thing she told me she said don't
[30:48] stop going to church she said no pares
[30:51] did
[30:51] iglesia and my dad said don't stop
[30:54] listening to the tapes
[30:57] i think that's the two things
[31:01] that help me from going totally insane
[31:06] i listened to the tapes over listen to
[31:10] them
[31:12] something maybe way deep down inside of
[31:14] me
[31:59] i would shut it off
[32:04] well bueno two years went by
[32:12] and uh i believe that through my
[32:16] trials
[32:19] god is still working somehow
[32:24] even in sin even in a club
[32:27] in la disco in the world in el mundo it
[32:30] doesn't matter where you're at
[32:32] if you're son of god he's going to call
[32:35] you
[32:39] so this evening
[32:48] [Music]
[32:53] the son of god
[33:08] miserable
[33:21] we're going out we're spending time with
[33:24] each other we're getting
[33:24] getting to know each other
[33:29] and uh on one occasion i
[33:33] started thinking well maybe whatever
[33:36] but i'm to keep hanging out with her
[33:41] marriage not for me
[33:47] that's how the devil had my mind wrapped
[33:49] up yes
[34:12] and i noticed her she was
[34:16] uncomfortable
[34:32] talking
[34:37] and this is where uh i believe god works
[34:40] through people
[34:44] sometimes it's the most it says
[35:03] and all this whole thing in my mind the
[35:05] whole time when i'm not with her i
[35:07] listen to tapes and brother branham and
[35:09] predestination and mark of the beast and
[35:11] all this stuff and
[35:12] and listening to all these tapes
[35:28] that person is a persona is my wife
[35:33] the next morning she tells me
[35:38] she goes hey i'm sick and tired
[35:42] yesterday living like this
[35:45] i want to surrender my heart to the lord
[35:47] jesus christ
[35:50] and if you don't want to do it then i
[35:53] don't know what we're doing together
[35:57] so i believe that every time god calls a
[36:00] man
[36:03] and if he's married he calls his wife
[36:07] with him
[36:09] so i'm gonna have her come up
[36:12] because this is where my message really
[36:14] starts
[36:16] i wanted to say maybe five minutes
[36:19] if you could take a west side
[36:35] somebody that knows what he's supposed
[36:37] to be doing but just can't get it right
[36:41] because the circumstances of life
[36:45] then i believe she is a big part of it
[36:50] i want her to say a little bit about
[36:52] what god has done
[36:58] yeah you can just come up right here
[37:35] but i do feel like it's really
[37:37] tremendous what god has done for me
[37:43] as as my husband said i am definitely
[37:46] like
[37:46] i come from the world
[37:51] i had you know piercings in my face i
[37:53] had colored hair
[37:54] i listened to rock music
[38:01] i knew who god was
[38:05] i loved god you are marios i said i
[38:08] loved god
[38:10] but i never lived for god
[38:14] you know it's two different things to
[38:15] say that you love someone
[38:18] and to show it
[38:23] so i would go to church my mom would beg
[38:25] me to go to church with her
[38:29] and i would go and it would be in one
[38:32] ear and out the other
[38:34] peru
[38:37] and that's just how our lives were yes
[38:40] and so i had also gone through you know
[38:42] my trials of my own
[38:47] and i was also just ready to throw in
[38:50] the towel just
[38:51] tired
[38:55] no no intention of ever getting married
[39:01] and when i met him it was
[39:05] obviously by god's grace or god's mercy
[39:11] and i knew from our very first date even
[39:14] though it was
[39:15] you know in the world
[39:21] i knew that there was something very
[39:23] special very different about him but i
[39:25] just didn't know what it was
[39:31] and and like he said we had been talking
[39:33] and we had been dating and it had months
[39:35] had gone by
[39:36] and has
[39:43] he's right it was over a period of three
[39:45] days that were very significant to me
[39:52] on a thursday on a friday and on a
[39:54] saturday we tried going out
[39:56] and dancing and doing what we always did
[39:59] just having
[40:00] fun in the world
[40:09] and i those three nights i couldn't have
[40:11] fun
[40:15] i was in a bad mood
[40:18] i i didn't want to be around him i
[40:21] thought oh he doesn't like me anymore
[40:28] and then on on the third night on a
[40:31] saturday
[40:35] we were out at the at the dance
[40:43] and and i look to him and inside of the
[40:46] inside of the club i start
[40:47] crying and crying and crying
[41:06] i grabbed his jacket and i wrapped
[41:07] myself in it
[41:11] and i said don't look at me
[41:15] and i didn't even know what i was
[41:16] talking about
[41:23] i had prayed to god i said lord change
[41:25] my life lord i'm sorry
[41:26] i'm so lonely lord
[41:32] and i said lord i have all these
[41:36] friends and i have this wonderful family
[41:41] and i can go out and meet people easily
[41:46] and i'm
[41:56] so that night i i go home and i just cry
[42:00] and i cry and i cry
[42:01] yes and i cried for a whole week
[42:05] straight i couldn't even talk to my mom
[42:07] i couldn't talk to my kids
[42:13] i just cried and i just stayed in prayer
[42:16] that whole week
[42:19] and i didn't know what it was to stay in
[42:21] prayer like that
[42:25] thrown on the floor crying out to the
[42:28] lord
[42:30] and just thanking him and just praying
[42:33] to him
[42:37] so then so um that's when we had the
[42:40] conversation
[42:42] yes
[42:56] and i grew up you know 20 miles down the
[42:58] road
[43:03] and i never heard of the message
[43:07] i had never heard of brother branham
[43:10] and i thought yo pence is this right
[43:16] and i thought is this a cult
[43:20] how come everybody's so nice and how
[43:22] come everybody's hair is so long and how
[43:24] come everyone's face is so clean
[43:26] with no makeup
[43:33] and that was after the first service i
[43:35] went to at phoenix tabernacle yes
[43:40] and that's when i started to ask him
[43:42] more questions
[43:45] and that's when he started to show me
[43:47] the things that would change my life
[43:52] and we started to listen to tapes
[43:56] and i started to find out who he really
[43:58] was
[44:01] and i found out the big family that he
[44:03] came from
[44:07] and who his parents are
[44:13] and growing up i had asked god always
[44:17] always always for a big sister
[44:20] ex i cried to the lord when i was little
[44:27] for her big sister named sarah
[44:32] so when i met sarah my my sister
[44:35] his sister
[44:39] i was blown away if we if we uh
[44:43] i was like how could the lord answer my
[44:46] prayer
[44:46] 30 years later comes
[44:53] and give me a big sister that i cried
[44:55] for when i was little named sarah
[45:00] and as i grew closer to the family
[45:05] he gave me another sister named rachel
[45:08] mario
[45:11] and they're both they both have been
[45:12] such big blessings in my life
[45:18] but um
[45:22] back to like our story so
[45:26] i wanted to get baptized
[45:30] about this army and
[45:34] when i was when it was my turn to get
[45:36] baptized in the back brother michael
[45:38] tells me
[45:42] you said sister be ready the devil's
[45:44] gonna be mad
[45:51] and and i said okay and he said just you
[45:54] guys stay strong in prayer
[45:55] and i said okay okay
[46:16] and that was a very hard thing to go
[46:17] through in our
[46:19] first year of marriage
[46:25] but it's still glory to god
[46:30] and we're very thankful for everything
[46:31] that god allowed from
[46:33] both of our parents
[46:38] my dad was able to walk me down the
[46:40] aisle
[46:43] my father-in-law was able to marry us
[46:48] so we're very thankful for everything
[46:50] that god allowed
[46:54] and in death always comes new life
[46:59] and right now i have a fire inside of me
[47:01] that i can't explain
[47:05] to just keep getting closer to the lord
[47:10] and i i like i said i grew up and i
[47:13] never heard of this message
[47:18] and now this message is something i can
[47:20] never forget
[47:24] and i can't even remember being in the
[47:27] in the world
[47:31] and i i asked the lord i said lord if
[47:34] this message is for me lord help me
[47:53] and that was the night i asked the lord
[47:55] just help me lord help me if this
[47:56] message is for me help me lord
[47:58] yes yes
[48:02] so i had a dream
[48:06] that i was walking at this park and
[48:07] there was a
[48:09] and there was a river that was or there
[48:11] was a a pond and it was really dirty
[48:21] and as i'm walking the water's getting
[48:23] clear
[48:26] and i can hear brother branham talking
[48:28] with me
[48:32] and we look down at
[48:35] and it went from dirty to clear
[48:39] olympia where i could see straight to
[48:40] the bottom
[48:43] and for me that was a tremendous dream
[48:48] tremendo because it just signifies how
[48:50] clear my life is right now
[48:56] that even though there's some moments
[48:57] that i can't see through
[48:59] a moment
[49:05] and i'm very thankful to be a part of
[49:07] this message
[49:10] and to know what we know
[49:14] that god is good
[49:18] thank you gracias
[49:42] is
[50:10] man
[50:30] is that better okay
[50:34] so we'll start now the mess title of the
[50:38] messages the greatest battle ever fought
[50:43] and when we start understanding
[50:46] that we're in a battle and it's not just
[50:49] a little uh
[50:50] a little gunfire here and there it is
[51:13] i'm going to start reading by reading
[51:14] some quotes
[51:17] i don't know how far i'll get no
[51:20] so
[51:32] if someone in the back will let me know
[51:34] hey your time's up
[51:37] i'm gonna just go entonces okay the
[51:40] first quote i'm going to read
[51:43] it's the message that i'm going to focus
[51:45] the majority of the the message
[51:46] this evening is called the greatest
[51:50] battle ever fought
[51:54] and it's re i'm going to read it reads
[51:55] like this
[51:57] now if you sit down when you get home
[52:01] and you draw three little rings
[52:04] you'll find out that the outside body
[52:06] has five senses
[52:10] and it's contacted by yes contact and
[52:13] you see c albert taste el probar
[52:43] that's the thing that controls the soul
[52:46] esos
[52:48] but the spirit pero espirito it only has
[52:50] one sense
[52:52] the spirit oh let's get it
[52:55] the spirit has one sense
[53:08] and there's only one avenue to it is
[53:26] growing up in the message i've listened
[53:29] to it my whole life
[53:30] told me that i heard the tapes every
[53:33] single day at my dad's house
[53:36] there was a tape going on i hear i heard
[53:39] it
[53:40] but i never
[53:52] god took somebody that would go out to
[53:53] the clubs and dance just
[54:08] try to
[54:20] i believe i gave my heart to the lord
[54:21] jesus christ when i was probably like 19
[54:23] years old
[54:27] but through the devil diablo using
[54:30] powers
[54:31] usando poderes to uh bring doubt
[54:36] in my mind
[54:44] [Music]
[55:03] i started like a baby again
[55:07] and i started looking at messages that i
[55:09] could understand
[55:13] i got away from the demonology
[55:16] big and the bigger messages that i
[55:18] really didn't understand
[55:22] and i started to focus on uh scriptures
[55:26] and messages
[55:29] that could really bring some
[55:30] practicality to my everyday life
[55:46] so i listen to easy messages i listened
[55:49] to the greatest battle ever
[55:53] i listened to thinking man's filters
[55:57] and i listened to how to overcome yes
[56:01] and with those three messages i believe
[56:04] that's what god has
[56:05] brought me here tonight to talk a little
[56:07] bit about it
[56:11] i'm going to keep reading it says god
[56:13] won't force you he said
[56:16] god doesn't force man to do anything
[56:20] you do it on your own
[56:25] he says he'll warn you maybe god will
[56:28] even throw a barricade across your path
[56:33] but you walk your own self with your
[56:36] own decisions
[56:41] in his presence and supressencia to make
[56:44] him
[56:44] your savior salvador but guess what
[56:50] you know what the the quote says it
[56:51] right here la sita love it says but
[56:53] satan has perverted
[56:55] god's plan pero satan
[57:23] the bible talks about a time where it's
[57:25] not me no more doing the sin
[57:29] but it is the sin that dwells in me
[57:32] so i couldn't do anything to help myself
[57:36] i didn't understand
[57:40] there was something from the inside out
[57:43] that was making my body do these things
[57:47] when i was in the world drinking but
[57:50] there was also something
[58:00] see therefore satan begins
[58:03] in the principle part to cause the
[58:06] spirit of man to doubt god's word
[58:14] god begins at the principal part to lay
[58:16] his word
[58:18] in that spirit diosco means
[58:23] there you are i estas that's what it
[58:25] does eso
[58:27] and brother branham says right here
[58:28] commander brandi he said if this church
[58:30] right now
[58:31] siesta iglesias could put together
[58:34] and
[58:39] that every person would be in one accord
[58:42] with not one shadow of a doubt anywhere
[58:46] there would not be a feeble person in
[58:48] our midst
[59:48] this next quote
[59:51] i had a mental conception of what god
[59:53] was
[59:56] but i hadn't let it drop down into my
[59:58] heart
[1:00:03] wasted wasted time
[1:00:06] without allowing god to come into my
[1:00:08] heart
[1:00:10] i accepted god in my mind
[1:00:22] satan approach is on this inside but so
[1:00:25] is god's i put that at the top
[1:00:34] that's that's what it does that then
[1:00:38] what does it do
[1:00:40] from the
[1:01:08] with the true word
[1:01:23] god comes to your mind he wants to
[1:01:26] accept
[1:01:27] the spirit the spirit of what
[1:01:30] spirit the spirit of
[1:01:33] fame
[1:01:43] you get a problem in your life
[1:01:46] none of those spirits can fight against
[1:01:49] your problems
[1:01:50] espiritos that's why you see
[1:01:53] millionaires
[1:01:55] with money coninero blowing their heads
[1:01:57] up
[1:01:59] that's why you see people with so much
[1:02:01] money
[1:02:03] miserable miserable
[1:02:18] he wants you to accept the spirit of god
[1:02:21] with faith
[1:02:23] confess faith in what even in his word
[1:02:26] ensue and the promises that he's given
[1:02:28] us
[1:02:30] the devil also comes to your mind
[1:02:50] how can we overcome this como podemos
[1:02:52] venceresto brother barnham says it's
[1:02:54] free moral
[1:02:54] agents live it's whatever you decide
[1:03:00] so when i was lost in the world
[1:03:03] and this girl yesterday
[1:03:06] that knows nothing about god comes to me
[1:03:09] and tells me a son of god
[1:03:12] malachi 4 5 believe it
[1:03:48] it says jesus said unto them i am the
[1:03:50] way the truth

[1:04:06] repented that something come into my
[1:04:08] mind
[1:04:10] and want to drop down into my heart i
[1:04:12] don't care what you've done
[1:04:16] there's not going to be an excuse and i
[1:04:19] would hear that
[1:04:20] and it's like i could hear brother
[1:04:22] branham saying it to me directly yes
[1:04:45] and what did he say blessed be the lord
[1:04:48] the lord giveth the lord take it away
[1:04:52] and here was i with a divorce one little
[1:04:55] thing una cosita throw it in the towel
[1:04:58] something told me you got to make a
[1:05:00] decision
[1:05:02] it's free moral agencies it's whatever
[1:05:04] you decide from this point forward
[1:05:26] i felt like god was going to give me one
[1:05:28] last chance
[1:05:33] to do good like i had done before
[1:05:36] no no to allow his spirit but
[1:05:41] come into my heart come from the inside
[1:05:44] out
[1:05:47] i want to read a scripture
[1:05:50] it's romans extend romanos
[1:05:54] 12 2 and 3. you don't have to go to it
[1:06:02] and be not conformed to this world
[1:06:07] but be transformed by the renewing of
[1:06:09] your mind
[1:06:15] what is that good
[1:06:23] for i say through the grace giving unto
[1:06:26] me
[1:06:28] that every man that is among you
[1:06:30] academic
[1:06:42] according as to god hath dealt to every
[1:06:44] man
[1:06:57] and god also let me allow me to step
[1:07:00] into the life of somebody else
[1:07:05] and use her as a tool
[1:07:08] to wake something up that was just way
[1:07:11] deep down in there
[1:07:19] for your little kids six seven eight
[1:07:21] years old
[1:07:23] bring them up the right way
[1:07:26] i don't believe that
[1:07:48] see i'm going to keep reading another
[1:07:50] quote
[1:07:52] god's working on the insider
[1:08:08] those things are respected
[1:08:11] but jesus said except the man be born
[1:08:14] again
[1:08:16] what is that there's got to something to
[1:08:18] happen inside
[1:08:36] and there's
[1:08:51] in his heart so he is as
[1:08:54] yes you see ben god
[1:08:58] kept pointing me to the same words
[1:09:03] moral agency
[1:09:16] i've heard about it my whole life i've
[1:09:19] seen it with my mom
[1:09:21] a lady from a ranch in the middle of
[1:09:23] mexico
[1:09:26] god brings her gives her an experience
[1:09:31] baptized with the holy ghost
[1:09:42] here's the message doesn't doubt it
[1:09:46] accepts it
[1:10:01] of the world so god knows exactly what
[1:10:04] we're all going to do
[1:10:06] he knows what we're deciding he knows
[1:10:09] how our mind is working
[1:10:12] well what's the matter today
[1:10:43] but he's trying to keep you away from a
[1:10:44] real testimony
[1:10:50] that's what the devil did to me
[1:10:55] he pointed me to a bunch of
[1:10:57] make-believers
[1:11:01] and i found myself lost
[1:11:04] why do i serve you guys
[1:11:07] look what you've done look what you've
[1:11:10] allowed me to do
[1:11:36] i could be in the clubs one day in los
[1:11:38] angeles
[1:11:45] what is it but the devil's always
[1:11:48] pointing at us
[1:11:51] to somebody's failures haciendas
[1:12:06] place brother braden says romano brandon
[1:12:10] says that in the soul there's a little
[1:12:13] place there that god put for himself
[1:12:16] and what he wants to do is he wants to
[1:12:19] put his spirit in you
[1:12:22] spirit and when he does that
[1:12:25] he wants to sit at the control rooms
[1:12:26] brother branham says
[1:12:30] and then when that happens then your
[1:12:32] conscience
[1:12:33] is your emotions
[1:12:42] [Music]
[1:12:48] see it's not just a mental conception
[1:12:52] it has to be something real
[1:12:55] he says it must be accepted in the mind
[1:12:59] then it's believed with the heart
[1:13:01] entonces
[1:13:13] and the body is just scored out with the
[1:13:15] holy spirit
[1:13:30] there's no doubt anywhere no i do that
[1:13:32] there's nothing that can rise up
[1:13:37] i'm going to skip forward
[1:13:42] i'm going to just keep reading a little
[1:13:44] bit
[1:13:48] god wants to fill you with the holy
[1:13:49] spirit
[1:13:52] and the devil wants to fill you with
[1:13:54] every other spirit diablo
[1:13:57] free moral agency
[1:14:39] but i didn't understand how god works
[1:14:43] he says you've got to get the soldier
[1:14:46] and he says
[1:14:47] the holy spirit placed at the
[1:14:49] battlefront el espiritu
[1:14:53] where's the battlefront
[1:15:08] there's nothing can no nada every one of
[1:15:11] the other channels is cleared out
[1:15:14] just like an old boiler
[1:15:19] flutes the flute the flute stop uh uh
[1:15:29] that's the matter with so many blowed up
[1:15:31] christians
[1:15:34] cristianos it's because they don't clean
[1:15:36] they
[1:16:05] but the circumstances of my life
[1:16:08] the devil didn't let me el diablo he had
[1:16:10] a grasp
[1:16:14] brother branham tells the story hermano
[1:16:15] bryant
[1:16:17] and he talks about this little girl she
[1:16:20] had
[1:16:20] hodgkin's lymphoma lymphoma
[1:16:24] mom took her to the doctor and she said
[1:16:28] uh take her home
[1:16:31] she has like three months to live
[1:16:34] hodgkin's lymphoma so she calls brother
[1:16:38] brandon
[1:16:39] brandon brother baton what should i do
[1:16:42] what i said well i'll bring her here to
[1:16:43] prison
[1:16:45] i'll pray for her so the bringer la
[1:16:47] train
[1:16:48] and when brother branham sees her
[1:16:50] economy
[1:16:52] and he sees her with a mini skirt
[1:16:56] paint it up and he asked her how can you
[1:17:00] accept god on those terms
[1:17:04] so what did you ask her do you accept
[1:17:07] the lord jesus christ as your savior
[1:17:10] salvador she said yes that they say she
[1:17:13] asked the mother do you accept jesus
[1:17:15] christ as your savior
[1:17:19] yes go in peace shall be healed
[1:17:24] see i didn't understand way back
[1:17:28] yatras that if unless i have the holy
[1:17:30] spirit in me
[1:17:34] there was no way to receive anything
[1:17:36] from god
[1:17:39] not healing no and not my salvation
[1:17:43] salvation
[1:17:46] i want to read acts 2 1.
[1:17:50] it shall come to pass
[1:17:53] says god that i will pour out my spirit
[1:17:55] on all flesh
[1:17:59] your sons and your daughters shall
[1:18:00] prophesy
[1:18:02] your young men shall see visions
[1:18:06] your old men shall dream dreams
[1:18:09] and my men servants and my men's maids
[1:18:12] servants
[1:18:14] will i pour out my spirit in those days
[1:18:18] and they shall prophesy and i will show
[1:18:21] wonders in the heavens
[1:18:24] and signs
[1:18:37] before the coming of the great and the
[1:18:39] awesome day of the lord
[1:18:44] 21st verses and it shall come to pass
[1:18:49] that whosoever calls on the name of the
[1:18:50] lord
[1:18:52] shall be saved i believe that with all
[1:18:56] my heart
[1:18:59] there's a battle going on
[1:19:03] god wants to place his spirit
[1:19:20] he says a thousand people can go through
[1:19:22] the prayer lines
[1:19:24] and they can all die you have to believe
[1:19:27] that you're the one
[1:19:39] i'm going to just skip forward
[1:19:47] what do we do
[1:20:16] in the word of
[1:20:43] and if i repented of my sins you would
[1:20:47] give me the gift of the holy ghost
[1:20:50] it's faith on his word
[1:20:53] brother branham says he says before you
[1:20:56] sin
[1:20:56] and escus you actually have to take the
[1:20:58] word of god
[1:21:01] you have to put it aside that's what i
[1:21:04] was doing
[1:21:05] i didn't have any faith the devil had
[1:21:07] deceived me
[1:21:09] but we have so many scriptures
[1:21:12] acts
[1:21:16] you shall receive the gift of the holy
[1:21:17] ghost
[1:21:19] those people that are sick isaiah 53
[1:21:23] 5 and 6.
[1:21:26] bias
[1:21:31] all these things are promises
[1:21:34] some promesas that god's giving us
[1:21:41] brother branham talks about romano
[1:21:43] brandon in ephesians
[1:21:46] 6 11 and ephesians says and he talks
[1:21:48] about putting on the whole armor of god
[1:21:53] and he talks about and he tells him how
[1:21:56] your loins should be girded above
[1:22:00] us and how you should take the shield of
[1:22:02] faith
[1:22:05] and that would be the only thing because
[1:22:08] that would quench the fiery darts of the
[1:22:09] wicked
[1:22:10] [Music]
[1:22:14] what are these things what is this to us
[1:22:20] when something is when you allow god to
[1:22:22] come way down deep
[1:22:23] into your soul
[1:22:28] and your spirit becomes one and he pours
[1:22:30] his spirit in you
[1:22:32] know then that's when you could start
[1:22:37] taking god at his word
[1:22:42] before that i couldn't do it
[1:22:46] see america dresses their soldiers
[1:22:50] america
[1:23:01] whatever they've got located armored
[1:23:03] tanks cones
[1:23:18] the spirit of the sword
[1:23:21] the word of god amen the word of god is
[1:23:24] sharper than a two-edged sword
[1:23:28] i didn't understand no no that even
[1:23:31] though i had given my heart to the lord
[1:23:32] jesus christ
[1:23:35] the devil had the ability to attack me
[1:23:37] el diablo
[1:23:40] and when he attacked me he attacked me
[1:23:42] in my um in my mind
[1:23:45] if you want to come to the piano i think
[1:23:47] my time is up see
[1:23:48] the piano yes i call me tiempo you
[1:23:50] attacked me in my mind
[1:23:55] brother branham says this is that we got
[1:23:58] to start doubting our doubts tenemos que
[1:24:00] pesara dudar
[1:24:26] i'm believing god's words
[1:24:40] do you want a change in your life
[1:24:49] do you want god to
[1:24:53] make everything different for you
[1:24:56] differently you see when
[1:24:59] you allow the spirit of the lord jesus
[1:25:01] christ
[1:25:04] and he comes way down and sits
[1:25:09] in the control room of your heart it is
[1:25:11] controlling
[1:25:12] then brother madam says you see
[1:25:13] different hermano brandon says
[1:25:17] you see people differently different he
[1:25:20] places love in your heart
[1:25:23] the hatred you had
[1:25:43] it changes everything
[1:25:49] the holy spirit el espiritu santo is
[1:25:51] what overcomes
[1:25:52] es lo everything and what is the holy
[1:25:55] spirit
[1:25:59] of the lord jesus christ planted in the
[1:26:01] throne of our hearts
[1:26:04] just because porque because you've given
[1:26:07] your heart to the lord jesus christ
[1:26:10] that doesn't mean the devil won't attack
[1:26:12] you yes
[1:26:14] if the devil attacked jesus christ
[1:26:16] himself
[1:26:18] what is the only thing that the devil
[1:26:19] will listen to questions
[1:26:25] what did he tell him he said man shall
[1:26:28] not eat by
[1:26:29] bread alone
[1:26:33] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[1:26:35] the mouth of god
[1:26:38] he fought him with the word he told them
[1:26:42] he responded to the devil with the words
[1:26:46] so this evening it's not
[1:27:18] what the seal of the living god is local
[1:27:21] then you will know sabran the bible said
[1:27:24] in ephesians 4 30.

[1:27:29] scriptures

[1:27:48] that you belong to
[1:27:51] it doesn't matter no important there's
[1:27:53] so many spirits trying to attack us
[1:27:55] right now
[1:27:57] that are trying to bring doubt
[1:28:10] that all the other spirits have to
[1:28:13] listen
[1:28:14] to latin spirit of the holy spirit
[1:28:18] the word of god that's telling us
[1:28:22] take god at his word
[1:28:26] god wants to fill you what does he want
[1:28:29] to fill you
[1:28:31] what does he want to fill you with
[1:28:35] he wants to fill you with himself
[1:28:39] the holy spirit filled with the holy
[1:28:42] ghost
[1:28:44] jesus said in luke 24 49.
