foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] looks inside of me I love you all this morning [Music] I'm really happy to be in the house of the Lord today I know I'm happy to be in the house of the Lord today [Music] I felt like I've uh I've hit a little bit from preaching for about a month or so Brother Don is joking with me he said no we're gonna we're gonna get you this month buddy it feels good to be here in the house of the Lord this morning it's really enjoyed the song specials they were sung today and it was nice to see another baby dedication this morning I'm sure brother Johnny would have been happy to have seen that if he were here we know he's in a better place I want to thank the pastor for the opportunity again and while I have you standing we can go right away into the word if you'd be so kind just to turn into Ezekiel 22. we're going to start in verse 29. I know Ezekiel can be a rather deep book of the Bible but uh we won't go too deep this morning let's keep things nice and simple today once more Ezekiel 22 29. and it reads the people of the land have used oppression and exercised robbery and have vexed the poor and needy yea they have oppressed The Stranger wrongfully he said and I sought for a man among them that should make up the Hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land that I should not destroy it but I found none foreign I want to read that again someone that would stand in the gap before me for the land that I should not destroy it but I found none is verse 31. therefore have I poured out my indignation upon them I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath their own way have I recompensed upon their heads saith the Lord God important we bow our heads for prayer Lord Heavenly Father we thank you this morning Lord for another opportunity of Life Lord to where we don't spend it anywhere else father no sporting events or restaurants or anything in the universe any of these Pleasures the world has to offered and it has so many to offer us but us that have entered into that love just that have entered into that Revelation into that statue we come here unto your house father because we want to worship you we want to deposit our petitions in your hands we want to have a communion and a fellowship with you and we long just to hear from you once again this morning I ask you father you will speak to your people today put me aside from my interpreter and just share some more words of edification for your children take control of this service we give you the honor and Glory Gloria in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you might be seated Brothers yeah I I if I can give a title to this uh this this message I really wanted to title it standing in the Gap but uh it felt like it was just so similar to the few uh topics we spoke on of agape love so if we could we'll title it this morning agapo love number three and as a subtitle standing in the Gap and as I was studying I came across the description Ezekiel and as I was reading chapter 22. it's just expressing this this evil Wicked people so much sin going on amongst the people and as we read the last three verses I was the guy was searching for someone that someone might intercede or stand in the gap for this people because God did not want to destroy these people but when he looked out he couldn't find anyone there was no one there that could or would stand in the gaps so the Lord had to unleash his wrath upon them you know I just want to say this morning I'm so thankful for his word you know every day just the little things that come alive to me in my life no I know I've heard it my whole life but we hear from the pulpit is every man's Word is Alive God's word is true and it's so simple but it's so real all things will pass but his word shall never pass no that tells me that's a very powerful word it's in like powerful and amazing magnificent magnifico you know brother Angel can you please stand yeah now Brothers can everyone please turn over and look at our brother Angels you may be seated brother I'm sorry for embarrassing you my word wasn't powerful enough to get him to stand up that was powerful enough for one individual yes but then my word was powerful enough we could say to control maybe 200 individuals but God's word was so powerful that he created something out of nothing he said let there be light Let There Be The Animals the waters the skies the birds so when I hear that that his word shall never passes I just think wow what a powerful and mighty God that we serve and don't just be answer one okay you know mankind they're always changing the world is always changing and trying to get better but there's one thing that doesn't change and that's his word yes it's the same yesterday today and forever and his man's trying to make the world better what they think is better with modernizing things in technology I've noticed they try to also fit God into their world when God's word doesn't change this man that's changing they might want to make this liberal church or this liberal God you know I've even heard of uh well at least we have them back in California homosexual churches and transsexual churches nowhere you're going to find that in the world God's word is the same yesterday today and forever if anything it's the world that's going to change to fit God's word when the word says as it was in the days of Life the world's going to change and it's going to change to go and follow that word because the word won't change when it says that men will be lovers of themselves the world's going to change to that point to fit the word that was spoken the same with when it speaks of wars and famines even when it speaks of the Dead in Christ shall rise first I mean the world will change to fit God's word and you know I I remember the last two times I spoke on Agape of love and if you remember in the scriptures when they asked Jesus Master what is the greatest Commandments love the Lord thy God with all thy mind with all thy soul with all thy heart we all remember that and then he gave him a second one also love thy neighbor that is equally as important it's just a significance and we explain how in order to do this you needed that agape love and how this was just a regular love but it was a higher love a deeper love is now if you notice if you've got this agape love in your life then you can fulfill these two Commandments that he said and you know and then all the other ten nine Commandments you know it's like almost like they're irrelevante not that we don't need them but we don't have to follow them but when you can have agap of love all the rest of those Commandments can come easily to you it's no longer going to be this burden or this issue on you the struggle that keeps you from being able to fulfill those Commandments because will take charge where you can fulfill those Commandments it's just pouring through you and within you yes and you know there's a man in the Bible that he was full of love within him you know Bible scholars say when they talk about this man he established at least 14 churches he had three Mission long missionary trips no not like going from one state to the other and coming back but when you go from one land to the next from that land to the next in the next and make your way all the way back home the biblical Scholars say that he traveled over 10 000 miles and they say that man is Paul you know after Paul had an encounter with Christ he was never the same in his life that one encounter that he had with Jesus Christ it changed the trajectory of his life it changed his beliefs completely from what they were to what they became foreign foreign for preaching the same same sermon over and over and over again the revelation of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ had been revealed to him and he had nothing more but to preach that revelation of who Jesus Christ is and he suffered many sufferings physical wounds in his body emotional wounds you know scars on the inside scars on the outside but every new day where he woke up no matter if it was in a prison maybe after being Stoned on a hospital bed okay or wake up in his own bed get back up and get on the road to preach that same message Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that's that word of God that has power is the power to change any man or woman's trajectory in their lives that's the power of the word of God now the holy ghost that Paul received is that not the same holy ghost that we received or by any means was it better back then was it stronger back then you know the the power and the strength that God gave Samson was it bigger and better back then no it's the same today it's the same Holy Ghost it's the same God it's just today's been revealed in its fullness for US foreign [Music] [Music] how much have we really sacrificed how much have we really suffered in our lives no I don't doubt that you haven't gone through pain I've been through plenty of pain I don't doubt that you've had heard in your life so you've gone through real sufferings in your life but I've said it before I'll say it again let suffering produce what it's going to produce it might sound hard or it might sound harsh but never should pain or any suffering or any hurt that we've gotten or an offense that's been committed toward us should ever pull us away from the words no pain or suffering you've been through should ever strip you away from fellowships pull you away from the body of Christ take you away from that consecrated life unto God friends should not do that to you suffering should not cause that in you but then the question will be within why does God allow it they used this scripture in the funeral a few days ago and they were saying there's a time to weep and there's a time to laugh so there's a time where we're going to be in the good times but there's also times where we're going to be people are going to offend us there's going to be times where we're going to be hurt there might be long periods of time where we're going to Harbor a pain inside of us but the scripture says all things work together the bad things and the good things they're not working separately but they're working jointly together and therefore God is the one that has allowed your pain he's allowed to suffering to even allowed the offenses that have been that we might be able to seal another Stepping Stone Those obstacles and challenges that are placed before us obstacles and yes sometimes they're so difficult they're so painful and heavy let us remember God was the one that allowed it in our lives you know sometimes the flesh we can be so weakness you know just a little bit of pain a little offense committed to us a little disagreement that we have with somebody yeah for us it might seem hugeot we pull ourselves out of the game this is like we just step out of the race you know imagine a boxer you know in the meat of the battle to run out to the corner and start searching for the towel and his trainer's back he himself can throw it in the ring it's ridiculous you're not trained for that the trainer the whole time yelling at the boxer those punches aren't hurting you can take more keep on fighting he's no match for you and how ridiculous it would be to see a boxer just throw in the town the trainers throw in the towel our trainer our coach we will never throw in the towel on us because we carry his bloodline his genes his strength his powers we will not lose that battle so let us be strong don't let these things cause us to run away so make us turn around maybe even grow and start growing a little seed of bitterness inside blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake this is for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven you are blessed Heaven is yours you've been persecuted but this is what you're getting for that persecution it says once again blessed are ye this is when man shall revile you when they purse and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely has anyone spoken all manner of evil falsely against you spoken behind your back is still wrong about your name the word says we are blessed is the first thing it says is Rejoice we can Rejoice for these things and now in English I like it because it kind of hammers it down even more if you read up there what it says in English and be exceedingly glad you know I can think someone doing backflips in somersaults and going hysterical they're so exceedingly glad for gray is your reward in heaven is for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you foreign I should be rejoicing and exceedingly rejoicing because great is my reward in heaven we got to apply it to ourselves that's my rewards the Kingdom of Heaven is Mineo can we do that this morning and and the in the message Hebrews chapter 6 number three may they shake away from their habits from their little tempers and the things that's been and as Paul said in the further part of the message let us lay aside every way that we might run with patients the race that is set before us looking to the author and finisher of our faith Jesus Christ who was tempted in all manner like we are without sinning he was tempted in all manner like each and every one of us yet did not sin he was permitted to be tempted and the key here is but he did not heed to the Temptation and now for us and we are tempted to sinus am I the only one tempted to sin so yeah I'm in this flesh I'm tempted to sin every day but it's on me am I going to sin or am I noticed he says and we are tempted to sin it is the life that is within us when I read that I think of what life is this is an eternal life is not from this Dimension not from a place of time him but from an eternal Dimensions that life is in me and it says it's at the anchor of our Eternal destination if you say yes that little portion of Eternity inside of us is what connects us and gives us that hope for the Eternal destination outside of this Dimension and we hold that sacred to our hearts you know and I know it's not easy to get over pain sometimes there's some pain that has taken me a really long time to get over I'm much we're in the flesh it's something that's natural to this flesh that we walk in yes and I know we all understand that feeling but if you truly been born again you know truly been born again because you know everyone in here we all look born again we talk with each other we sound born again we act like we're born again but the key word is if you're truly born again then it's when that Holy Spirit is it can overcome and take control it can get in the cockpit of that plane and take control of our lives and overpower the Flesh and the pull that it gives us if I ever have to love you know the only way I can do so is if God gives me the strength to do so you know we're not trying to perform a lip service we don't want to just say it with our mouths and just say it with a Smiles but we want it to be something real inside of us and I know that if and when it gets hard and you know genuinely inside of us that we really want to make things right and we really want to love that Persona and the key word is we genuinely want to love that person sometimes it is too difficult you know but we have somewhere to go for help sometimes that battle of the flesh it is too strong I want to love my brother then I can say to God you know Lord I'm struggling so much but God I need your help I know that we've been going through this issue I know that I have this Strife with my brother or sister the Lord help me to Love Like You Love Me my spoken word like I said in the beginning they controlled everyone in this room and if I have a portion of God and I speak that word no matter how much my brother Emmanuel offends me if I speak the word Lord give me the strength to love my brothers he will give me that love so that I can give back that love is you know but we need to be careful no these pains and offenses the hurts that we go through they can become a justification they can turn into an excuse in our lives for an excuse for our conduct an excuse for our bitterness just justification as to why I've been so distant because brother you just don't get it you don't understand what I've been through if you knew you know why I don't come to church anymore if you know what happened to me you know why I don't go to Fellowship anymore if you know what my family suffers if you know what my husband went through what my wife went through it's a justification it turns into an excuse because this pain after this pain after this pain we're just justifying the bitterness that has been growing inside of us the devil is good at his job in I don't know if folks like to hear that or not but I got to be honest he's really good at his job he's not like me sometimes I sleep on the job if I don't have enough haircuts in the day I'm just a little bored I fall asleep I could be out on the streets trying to get more haircuts for them to come to the barbershop do something to stay on the job but instead I go to bed but the Devil he's not sleeping when it comes to us he's on the job 24 7. how can I separate them from how can I get this husband to fall into uh to to fight with this wife no he's constantly working and then the devil can trick us to get into a place where we start to nurse those wounds that we've been going through I was trying to explain to my brother Emmanuel in the back and I pray that I can explain it right now but we'll like nurse our wounds that we carry escape and and it's like it's for a single purpose in our life because we love the attention that when our brother Edward Jackson came to this church for the first time Edward Jackson there were brothers right away they tended to him and listened to him and heard his struggle and his sufferings because they're genuine Christians they want to show that love but we can get so obsessed with the hurt and the pain in our lives that we just can't get over it it is like a fear on the inside of foreign [Music] when those memories and those traumas come on some of those things that we have that happened to us before serving God and some this happened since we've been serving God we can now tap into that and then defeat that pain because that will heal our hearts we don't need the compassion of anybody else I don't need psychologists and counseling in your yours because that's what they do out in the world I need Jesus Christ God is my eternal Comfort dioses he's the one that will bind the Brokenhearted and we've got a wave of brokenhearted people some with little hairline fractures and somewhere that whole glass is shattered from edge to edge but he's here to bring Liberty unto the captain let that agape love heal you this morning let it restore whatever is pulling you down in your life in the message he came to the Earth he said he suffered as a man he was he was tempted in all manners like we are without sin he became a perfect Kingsman redeemers he suffered in his body he bore our infirmities and in his body to take it away and he come down what is it case God condescending coming down you know I think I can safely say that no one has suffered more than Jesus no one's hurt more than Jesus is hurt but can you imagine if we gave the same time into the same amount of time and attention that we give to the pain and the hurt that's been inflicted upon us if we gave that same amount of time to the pain and offenses we've Afflicted on others the times where we might have said something to somebody we offended somebody you know spiritually or physically and what if we knew about all the times we don't know about I think if we gave the equal amount of time to that pain not the one given to me but the one that I've given out I think we'd reevaluate the pain that we've suffered I think we look at things just a little bit differently in our lives maybe there's someone this morning that can say in your mind in your heart you know I remember this one time foreign [Music] and now I want this person to make things right with me I would say to myself I do say to myself Lord help me to truly love my brothers to truly love my sister foreign no no I think I'm barely getting into the message now forgive me but I want to get to the point in my life in my Christian walk where even no matter what type of offense I get okay you know and it's a tough one I know that he's wrong he knows that he's wrong and all of you know that he's wrong but where I can say God forgive him for my sake Lord forgive him for myself where we can make an intercession we can stand in the Gap where we can love someone with that Agape for their forgiveness but so that we can have peace it doesn't take the other person to make it right it takes you to get in consecration with God and you intercede for your brothers we might have the spoken word we can stand in the Gap and we can make that thing right we I believe his brother Eli said we hold the power of healing in our hands so why can't we put it to you know Lord help us all right because it's difficult and if there's anything I I want to get away from it's fake forgiveness you know where we say I forgive you or we you know I forgive this person I forgive that person is and once again I'm speaking to myself universe but every time something negative happens so my brother my sister whoever the person is you know there's there's like there's something inside of you they might be thinking well you know brother Emmanuel kind of had it coming you know something inside of me gets a little bit of a satisfaction that that thing happened to him there's the you know to see him hurt to fail himself maybe we're so prideful or maybe we're just so religious that we can't say it with our mouths but it's speaking loud and clear inside of our hearts how we're actually just a little happy when somebody else gets a little bit of suffering in their life I'm just trying to be honest here I enjoyed brother Johnny speaking on Friday he was just trying to be honest and speak from his heart and you know we're all waiting for a Rapture and we claim to be Rapture Ready [Music] with faith say you know I'm ready for the Rapture I'm going to be ready for that Rapture is funny I heard a brother say it like this and speaking about the Rapture he said you know I'm not going to get a body change until I think it's time that we put our Petty doctrines aside and I'm not talking about big things like uh the return and no return the seals or all these things some of these doctrines are so simple yes like I got my own doctrine of where I need to sit in church I got my own doctrine of how where I need to park in the parking lot my own doctrine of what days I'm willing to come to church these are Petty doctrines we need to make sure we can get rid of those things so we can really love our brother or our sister is thing if it's so strong and so powerful that is pulling me away and more away from my brother Emmanuel then something's wrong there maybe it's his Doctrine maybe it's mine but whether it's his or mine I know what I can do I can't stand in the Gap I can love my brothers I can put my doctors aside and say you know what maybe I don't understand you brother but I'm gonna try and look at things through your view and I'm just gonna love you and maybe God will reveal it to both of us you know can it be possible that my hurts and my beliefs yes you know can they be greater than my love many times it is because we feed it and we feed it and we feed it and then before you know when we see we're so distant from God it's been so many years since we've had fellowship with our brothers been so long since we've even stepped foot in the church and it's been pulling us away little by little but something's got to change that's something can change today we can stand in that Gap foreign how are we going to make it there in heaven can we truly say I'm going to be there and smile at my brother's face when I can't smile at him on a Sunday morning I'm not speaking to anybody I'm speaking to myself the book of Galatians chapter five if we bite and devour one another take heed or else you'll be consumed of one another there was another version of the Bible that went a little more Savage with the reading it says take forgive me it says beware of acting like uh what did it say raging animals he said kill each other the scripture wants to compare us to Savage animals when we enter in that state animals it's a danger zone when we enter into those contentions and dissensions with our brother and sisters then he says in the very next verse but walk in the spirit and do not fulfill the lusts of the flesh don't be like a wild animal like her brother was saying don't go after I don't want a brother was pouring his heart I don't want to uh live by the fruits of the flesh but I want to live by the fruits of the spirits the same here I want to walk in the spirit you know in the book of Exodus uh in chapter 32 you know there's someone here that stood in the Gap and it's tremendous because how we can see two sides to that agape love of God yes just skimming through if you started at verse 17. this is a Joshua heard a noise and and they were shouting and then Mo and and he went unto Moses because he thought it was a war in the camp is you know and Moses was saying it's not a voice of War but it's it seems like they're they're singing they're they're having a party over there you know and when they went down they saw that there was a golden calf they were men men and women dancing all around probably all these Pagan and disgusting worldly dances and worship to this cast it says that Moses was Furious in his anger he took the calves he says he burnt it to the fire grounded down to powdered and then he mixed it in with water he was so angry so angry that he made the children of Israel drink it that same thing they were worshiping that what they were indulging in that pleasure and that that immorality grinding it down sit now you drink it and now if you jump down to verse 26. she said Moses then he stood in the gate of the camp he says who's on the Lord's Side if you are common to me get on this side and all the sons of Levi gathered together then the prophecy or he prophesied forgive me thus saith the Lord God of Israel so this is now God speaking through him a punishment that was going to happen upon the people I should say a chastisement for correction go out and from gate to gate throughout the entire campaign and slay every man his brother and his companion and his neighbor anything that's exactly what they did and three thousand men died what a what a horrendous thing that might have been that day these brothers that they grew up with that they loved they had to slay them because we have a jealous God Thou shalt have no other gods before me they couldn't wait and hold themselves if they started serving another God that the very next day Moses had said you all have sinned a great sin Gran pecado but now I need to go with the Lord I'm gonna make an atonement for your sins I'm gonna go stand in the cap for your sins it sounds like he was repented he was sorry he was feeling compassionate because he knew they needed to be chastised but the other part of God's Agape Love Is that reconciliation is that restoration that atonement Moses went unto the Lord and how he says unto God these people they've sinned a great sin he said I would ask if you would please forgive their sins I could imagine he was in tears and crying out to God to the point where he even says and block me out take my name out of the book let me be the one to cast this cast their sins upon me don't judge them don't punish themes even though they did wrong okay they broke a direct Commandments but I'll take the blame for them I'll be the one to send the atonement for them Moses carried out judgment but the very next day there was mercy and there was Grace Brown says it was a spirit of Christ within Moses even though judgment and Grace had to come okay they were equally an expression of the love of God Moses was standing there in the gap and you know just for question purposes in the Book of Psalms 106. and verse 23. it says therefore he said that he would destroy them so because of what they did the sin that they committed God would have destroyed them all Moses chosen to stand before them in the breaches how one man could stand in the bridge for a nation of millions the God's Wrath wouldn't fall upon Millions for just one man the god would turn his wrath and not destroy them he stood in the breach for them but God needed someone to deliver that people because that was his word he would receive a deliverer the spirit of Christ would come before Christ even stepped foot on this Earth and love is eternal and his spirit is eternal and though it came in this year when it came out of Eternity to go into Moses it did the exact same thing that Jesus came to do for us the wrath of God and his punishment would not fall upon us but that we can have forgiveness because one person could stand in the Gap and you know we're standing in the Gap today as the bride judgment hasn't struck the Earth because we're still here which means you can still be that one to stand in the gap for somebody else and many times we apply it to someone out in the world it can be so simple as somebody inside your family remember we can speak the word remember we can stand in the Gap remember it's just simply Agape agape Psalm said God would have destroyed them the word says that God will destroy the Earth but there can be select individuals that can be saved if we can stand in the gaps we're going to be closing if you don't please stand yeah musicians can come forward in the book of Acts to close with this story here we have Stephen and we talk so much about Stephen in chapter 7 verse 51 in El Capitol says Stephen was here talking or better yet he was preaching with the conviction you stiff-necked and uncircumcised in your heart and ears you always resist the holy ghosts he wasn't beating around the bush he was getting right to the point you you which persecuted the prophets you and your fathers and now your betrayers and you're all just a bunch of murderers you've received the law but you don't even keep it for this position and what happens when they were hearing these things they cut their hearts it struck them in a bad way says and being full of the Holy Ghost he looked up steadfast into heaven he saw the glory of God and he said I see the heavens open and the son of man standing on the right hand of God and they cried out with the loud voice the others they're the ones listening and they ran up to him and they cast him out of the city and as we all know they began to Stone himself the witnesses then says the Bible says that they lay down their clothes at a young man's feet and that young man happened to be Saul yeah and they stoned Stephen the Bible says and you know what he says next it says that and he called upon God and he said Lord Jesus receive my spirit we knew what time it was in his life he knew that he was at the end of the road in his life Lord receive my spirit as he's being stoned Elizabeth but the very next scripture says that he cried with the loud voice you notice the difference here he knew he was going to die so he said take my spirit maybe with the soft voice maybe just in his heart but this next part here lay not the sin to their charge is don't blame them for what they're doing don't punish them for what they're doing he said it out loud screaming so that everyone in attendance could hear and then he died you just got done preaching the entire Bible to these Pharisees and they got so jealous that they wanted to kill him but God is still God yesterday today and forever Place some Valiant Soldier to stand in the Gap even if it's to the death when he shouted that out everyone heard everybody heard but that might have just been for one person to hear that was so that Paul could hear because he had a mission upon his life there was a calling upon his life and if if Stephen had not said those words who knows what would have happened to Paul but we did read that if God if Moses would have not interceded those people would have been killed by God but Steven into interceded just like Moses without even knowing who Paul was and said don't lay this sin upon their charge so the Paul could be free of that sin foreign [Music] and you didn't do nothing about it he was there and he didn't do anything about it and was equally at foreign please close your eyes I'm just going to read this last quote before we pray it says now we're all going to make mistakes but just remember when you're looking out at one another don't look at that person's mistake see don't do that because remember you make mistakes but look to Christ who is guiding this Persona and if they need some help and you just pray for them that's the way that we get along you see praise when you're praying for somebody else that's in that kind of a fix God will honor dios and heal you God will honor and heal you that's what Christianity is based upon Christian to help one another do for one another be kind to one another yes and if you see your neighbor's mistakes you see where they've went wrong don't go wrong with them but just pray for them just keep praying and God will understand that and God will make everything right Lord Jesus we thank you today Lord Jesus gracias father we just want to please you this morning Lord give us more of your gospel love this morning then maybe we might have understood today that we make plenty of mistakes and we've offended many people but I don't need them to make it right with me Lord I can stand in the gap for them because just like he has I have the same desire to see you on that great and glorious day where we can meet up in the skies so father through that love Lord help me love my brother and sister more and more yamas that I can continue to love them every day more and more and more and I might have given a bad face to my brother here on this Earth but I want to love him here like I'm going to love him up there but the only way I can achieve that is through your love so father together may we all stand in that Gap all right Believers and members of this church as Christians as Christians in this state in this country Lord being a light to the world father let us apply these things in our lives in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] please [Music] like goodbye [Music]
