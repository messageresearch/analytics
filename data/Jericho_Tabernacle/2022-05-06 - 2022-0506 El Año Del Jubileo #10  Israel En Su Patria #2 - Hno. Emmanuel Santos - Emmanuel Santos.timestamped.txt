[27:10] i'd like to go to revelation chapter 3.
[27:13] verse 7.
[27:16] we thank the musicians
[27:42] and to the angel of the church in
[27:43] philadelphia write these things saith he
[27:45] that is holy he that is true he that
[27:48] hath the key of david he that openeth
[27:50] and no man shut it and shutteth and no
[27:52] man openeth it
[28:05] i know thy works behold i have set
[28:07] before thee an open door and no man can
[28:10] shut it for thou hast a little strength
[28:12] and has kept my word and has not denied
[28:14] my name
[28:24] is
[28:35] him that overcometh will i make a pillar
[28:37] in the temple of my god and he shall go
[28:39] no more out and i will write upon him
[28:41] the name of my god and the name of the
[28:44] city of my god which is the new
[28:46] jerusalem which cometh down out of
[28:48] heaven from my god and i will write upon
[28:50] him my new name
[28:55] now we want to go to leviticus chapter
[28:57] 25.
[29:06] the word says
[29:14] then shalt thou cause the trumpet of
[29:16] jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the
[29:18] seventh month
[29:24] in the day of atonement shall you make
[29:26] the trumpet sound throughout all your
[29:27] lands
[29:42] and you shall hallow the 50th year and
[29:44] proclaim liberty throughout all the land
[29:46] unto the inhabitants thereof it shall be
[29:49] a jubilee unto you and ye shall return
[29:51] every man unto his possession and ye
[29:54] shall return every man unto his family
[30:06] a jubilee that 50th year be unto you ye
[30:10] shall not sow neither reap that which
[30:12] groweth of itself in it nor gather the
[30:15] grapes in it of the vine undressed
[30:24] for it is jubilee and it shall be holy
[30:26] unto you you shall eat the increase
[30:28] thereof out of the field
[30:34] in the year of this jubilee ye shall
[30:36] return every man unto his possession
[30:42] may the lord have the blessing to the
[30:43] reading of his word
[30:44] you may be seated
[30:50] this evening we're going to continue on
[30:52] the year of jubilee
[30:55] this is uh part number 10. israel
[30:59] and israel in the homeland part too
[31:02] not
[31:30] i like to read a quote from brother
[31:31] branham
[31:35] in the message is your life worthy of
[31:37] the gospel
[31:39] says now now we notice
[31:42] and in the old testament
[31:50] that was when all the people that were
[31:52] slaves
[31:55] could go free when the jubilee sounded
[32:04] if there was some excuse he could give
[32:05] por la cual no que here
[32:07] that he didn't want to return to his
[32:09] land
[32:26] that
[32:32] he could never no more come back as a
[32:34] citizen in israel hamas no more
[32:36] queso what did he do
[32:40] he rejected his
[32:54] he could go right back to his homeland
[32:58] position and get his own possession
[33:02] but if he refused to do it
[33:07] then he wasn't lauded no more with
[33:09] israel
[33:11] and his possession was given to another
[33:17] so the trumpet today is the predication
[33:20] it's the preaching of the gospel
[33:41] is the preacher that comes to preach to
[33:43] you the good news
[33:46] that christ paid the price for your sins
[33:51] therefore you don't have to be a slave
[33:52] to sin
[33:55] the trumpet today is the preaching
[33:59] that's why there's ministers
[34:03] they're the ones that are playing the
[34:05] trumpet
[34:06] that lets you know
[34:09] and you've got the decision
[34:13] to stay safe if you want to stay in your
[34:14] condition
[34:16] or be free
[34:25] and christ has a homeland
[34:47] the inheritance that was left for us
[34:50] is what christ left us in his bible
[34:53] that's the position he left us
[35:28] predestinated
[35:30] even before being born again
[35:34] god already knew who you were
[35:39] that's why when you hear the preaching
[35:40] of the jubilee
[35:42] you can go
[35:57] what's written in the world can never be
[35:58] fulfilled hasta que la persona
[36:01] until the person dies
[36:03] we know that right
[36:05] for example a father
[36:07] that has many possessions
[36:10] he makes a will
[36:20] and then everything written in that will
[36:22] is fulfilled
[36:24] foreign la sangre this is the blood the
[36:28] minuel testament of my new testament
[36:34] but now the things he spoke never came
[36:36] to pass
[36:38] but he spoke in that testament
[36:41] until he died
[36:44] that's why he needed to die
[36:47] for he is the testator
[36:52] but what's written in the testament is
[36:54] never fulfilled
[36:56] until the testator dies
[36:59] that's why christ died
[37:01] he resurrected him
[37:03] and then he sent the holy ghost
[37:35] which means the self-existing one
[37:38] it was just him
[37:41] but brother branham says that we were
[37:43] with him
[37:44] in his thoughts
[37:47] we were in his mind
[38:02] and then we go
[38:18] brother branham says in the exposition
[38:19] of the seven church ages
[38:21] in the smyrna in church age
[38:23] yes
[38:26] and that is exactly what we have been
[38:27] saying estos
[38:54] the true bride of christ was in the mind
[38:56] of god eternally
[39:02] though not expressed until each came
[39:03] forth in the design in the designated a
[39:06] medida
[39:08] as each member came forth
[39:12] so it became expressed and took its
[39:15] place in the body
[39:18] thus this bride is
[39:23] the literal spoken word seed bride young
[39:26] feminine destination though she is
[39:29] though she is feminine in designation
[39:33] she is also called the body of christ
[39:39] it is very apparent that she ought to be
[39:40] called for that she was predestinated in
[39:43] him
[39:45] came from the same source
[39:48] was eternal with him
[39:52] now it's manifesting god and cuerpo de
[40:21] he's got an earthly body
[40:34] and it's the same spirit of christ that
[40:36] was in those bodies
[40:39] so the same spirit of christ
[40:42] that was in the earthly body of jesus
[40:46] now is the same holy ghost
[40:50] that's in the mystic body of jesus
[40:51] christ
[40:54] and that body is now here on the earth
[40:56] but it's the same body
[40:59] it's got the same spirit
[41:04] remember
[41:19] primarily
[41:21] first of all they're just thoughts
[41:24] and then they become acts
[41:27] the same thing with god
[41:30] he first had thoughts
[41:46] and when you're
[42:04] let this mind be in you which was also
[42:06] in christ jesus
[42:09] and i enjoy how it says in english
[42:12] it says that this mind
[42:14] is
[42:54] it's got different manifestations
[43:00] it takes you to the baptism of the holy
[43:01] ghost
[43:03] to the revelation of jesus christ
[43:06] unto the rapture
[43:08] unto the new jerusalem
[43:10] and unto the millennium
[43:24] it was
[43:28] of the supreme deity of jesus christ
[43:33] not being the second person of a trinity
[43:39] but being god himself made flesh
[43:41] dwelling among us
[43:43] and the revelation
[43:45] now if you notice in just a minute
[43:49] let's just read a little bit further
[43:53] then brother branham reads the scripture
[43:54] we just read this
[43:58] it says shut it and has little strength
[44:02] and has not denied my name
[44:04] is
[44:21] and luther come out with a name that he
[44:23] was alive
[44:25] and was dead that's right
[44:28] father son holy ghost
[44:32] jesus
[44:35] here comes out the name of jesus again
[44:37] in between the in between these two ages
[44:42] in between the open door is una
[44:44] revelation now it's a revelation
[44:47] what he was
[45:28] that the first revelation someone needs
[45:43] at the day of pentecost
[45:47] and that manner you can receive
[45:50] the revelation of the deity of jesus
[45:52] christ
[45:55] that's why that's the first revelation
[45:57] you need
[47:07] i was studying and i really enjoyed this
[47:08] part here
[47:11] i'd like to go to matthew chapter 5
[47:12] verse 18.
[47:21] so
[47:26] for verily i say unto you till heaven
[47:28] and earth pass one jot or one tittle
[47:31] shall in no wise pass from the law till
[47:33] all be fulfilled
[47:36] what that means
[48:04] also
[48:10] and i'm going to show you how this
[48:11] connects onto the jubilee in lucas
[48:13] cuatro in luke chapter 4.
[48:16] verse 17.
[48:27] and there was delivered unto him the
[48:28] book of the prophet isaiah and when he
[48:30] had opened the book he found the place
[48:32] where it was written
[48:49] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[48:51] because he hath anointed me to preach
[48:52] the gospel to the poor he had sent me to
[48:55] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[48:56] deliverance unto the captives and
[48:58] recovering of sight to the blind and to
[49:01] set at liberty them that are bruised
[49:06] to preach the acceptable year of the
[49:08] lord
[49:10] which we know is the jubilee year
[49:13] now i've mentioned it
[49:14] before but i'm going to repeat it
[49:20] it says here that he took the prophecy
[49:22] that it was in isaiah
[49:25] in isaiah it's chapter 61. to stay by
[49:28] elect if you
[49:43] to preach the the year the year of the
[49:45] lord
[49:46] in isaiah
[49:48] it has a comma there
[49:51] but right here it has a period
[50:05] is the second coming of the lord jesus
[50:07] christ
[50:10] what she says is the day of vengeance
[50:13] it's not the year of jubilees
[50:16] it's the year of vengeance
[50:18] but right here in luke jesus
[50:22] jesus only reads one part
[50:52] and it's demonstrated right there in the
[50:53] prophecies
[50:55] in isaiah there's just a comma
[50:58] representative that that comma
[51:00] represents
[51:01] millennials a period of around two
[51:03] thousand years
[51:05] where it talks about the first coming
[51:18] but it represents a time period of 2000
[51:19] years yes
[51:23] and that was back when jesus only read
[51:25] one part era la transition it was the
[51:27] transition
[51:29] from law unto grace
[51:33] even being in the law
[51:48] why because the bible says everything
[51:50] must be fulfilled
[51:52] not just the words that are written
[51:54] within the grammatical but even the
[51:56] grammar
[51:59] in
[52:00] prophecy now in the prophecy el espirito
[52:15] now i really enjoy the translations
[52:19] in spanish it says the good news
[52:21] in english
[52:22] and in english it uses the word the
[52:24] gospel
[52:27] now we know that the gospel is the good
[52:28] news
[53:12] is
[53:40] maybe
[54:36] to be able to share it unto other people
[54:41] so the spirit of the lord is upon me
[54:47] because he has anointed me to preach the
[54:48] gospel to the poor
[55:04] everyone
[55:18] anointing
[55:21] expressed in five different ways
[55:24] but that anointed the spirit of christ
[55:29] now in john 132
[55:32] i
[55:46] records saying i saw the spirit
[55:48] descending from heaven like a dove and
[55:50] it aboled upon him
[55:52] juan mismo
[55:53] so john himself was a witness
[55:56] jesus
[55:58] of how it is that john was
[56:00] jesus was anointed
[56:03] to preach the gospel
[56:06] so that anointing of jubilee juan puedo
[56:10] john could see it
[56:13] and that's when the holy ghost
[56:28] when john baptized
[56:56] jesus
[57:05] [Music]
[57:29] how god anointed jesus of nazareth with
[57:31] the holy ghost and with power who went
[57:33] out doing good and healing all that were
[57:35] oppressed of the devil for god was with
[57:37] him
[58:06] [Music]
[58:20] he was given a warning
[58:34] jesus
[58:57] it was to oppress it was to heal those
[58:59] uh broken hearted a pregnant libertado
[59:02] to preach liberty unto the captives
[59:06] and sight unto the blind
[59:09] and to set at liberty them that are
[59:10] bruised
[59:14] that comes upon the preacher
[59:30] freedom from the devil
[59:33] that's what the jubilee produces
[59:36] but everything begins with you
[59:40] if you decide that you want to accept
[59:42] christ
[59:44] if
[1:00:00] brother branham says christ is the
[1:00:01] mystery of god revealed
[1:00:04] says what is it noah personas not ten
[1:00:07] people
[1:00:10] the headship and the bodyguard
[1:00:22] that's the reason the husband and the
[1:00:24] wife is no longer twain
[1:00:25] uno they're one
[1:00:26] [Music]
[1:00:40] his name
[1:01:06] the anointing is also for the mystical
[1:01:08] body of christ
[1:01:36] and through there god works his
[1:01:38] threefold manifestation yendo asia el
[1:01:40] reyno going to the kingdom
[1:01:44] says risen
[1:01:45] hate the prize estas
[1:01:47] we're redeemed
[1:02:04] because grammar
[1:02:19] grand period
[1:02:21] a great period of time
[1:02:24] just like in jubilee representatives
[1:02:26] it represented almost 2 000 years
[1:02:29] from the first coming
[1:02:30] on to the second coming
[1:02:49] before the coming of the great and
[1:02:50] dreadful day of the lord
[1:02:56] and he shall turn the heart of the
[1:02:57] fathers to the children coma comma
[1:03:08] and the heart of the children to the
[1:03:09] fathers
[1:03:13] lest i come and smite the earth with the
[1:03:15] curse
[1:03:17] the anointing of elijah
[1:03:20] complain
[1:03:21] fulfills this
[1:03:26] it turns the heart of the fathers unto
[1:03:27] the children
[1:03:39] it represents somewhere around two
[1:03:41] thousand years
[1:03:56] that
[1:04:16] and he says those are also the apostolic
[1:04:18] fathers
[1:04:19] pentecostals the pentecostal fathers
[1:04:22] the spirit of elijah
[1:04:40] millennials it represents a time period
[1:04:42] of 2000 years
[1:04:45] for it to be completely fulfilled
[1:04:49] there's still people today
[1:04:51] god knows who they are
[1:04:54] they've got to come back
[1:04:58] that's why we haven't gone back to where
[1:04:59] god is literally literally
[1:05:04] because we're waiting for those that
[1:05:06] still they're still awaiting
[1:05:09] to hear their day of jubilee media
[1:05:12] my day of jubilee
[1:05:13] different may be different
[1:05:16] of your day of jubilance
[1:05:20] maybe today is the day that i hear the
[1:05:22] trumpets
[1:05:24] and i decide i want to be free
[1:05:27] and maybe next month
[1:05:29] or the next year
[1:05:30] next week
[1:05:34] you decide that's going to be your day
[1:05:35] of jubilee media jubilee my day of
[1:05:37] jubilee difference
[1:05:40] can be different from your day of
[1:05:41] jupiter
[1:05:42] because you've got to accept it
[1:05:45] el calvario what christ did on calvary
[1:05:48] who leon so
[1:05:59] represents the time period of about two
[1:06:00] thousand years
[1:06:21] and there appeared unto him an angel of
[1:06:23] the lord standing on the right side of
[1:06:25] the altar of incense
[1:06:31] and when zechariah saw him he was
[1:06:32] troubled and fear fell upon him
[1:06:44] but the angel said unto him fear not
[1:06:46] zacharias for for your before thy prayer
[1:06:48] is heard and thy wife elizabeth shall
[1:06:50] bear thee a son and thou shalt call his
[1:06:52] name john
[1:06:57] and thou shalt have joy and gladness and
[1:06:59] many shall rejoice at his birth
[1:07:10] for he shall be great in the sight of
[1:07:11] the lord and shall drink neither wine or
[1:07:13] strong drink and he shall be filled with
[1:07:15] the holy ghost even from his mother's
[1:07:17] womb
[1:07:20] now quickly i just want to touch this
[1:07:22] point
[1:07:23] on verse 15
[1:07:27] it says shall drink neither wine or
[1:07:29] strong drink
[1:07:32] do you remember brother branham
[1:07:34] when he was a child
[1:07:38] and a voice spoke to him out of a little
[1:07:39] whirlwind
[1:07:54] because a job awaits you when you're
[1:07:55] older juani lemon brown tuberose john
[1:07:58] and brother branham had the same
[1:07:59] experience
[1:08:01] they could not defile themselves
[1:08:02] contaminate themselves
[1:08:05] in verse 16
[1:08:11] and many of the children of israel shall
[1:08:13] he turn to the lord their god
[1:08:19] has
[1:08:24] he shall go before him in the spirit and
[1:08:25] the power of elias to turn the hearts of
[1:08:28] the fathers to the children
[1:08:35] and and the disobedient to the wisdom of
[1:08:37] the just to make ready of people
[1:08:39] prepared for the lord
[1:08:43] now this is an angel of the lord
[1:08:45] this is not the devil
[1:08:48] this is an angel of the lord
[1:09:03] of malachi 4 5.
[1:09:07] and he only said
[1:09:12] to turn the hearts of the fathers unto
[1:09:14] the children
[1:09:17] and he did not quote the second part
[1:09:21] where after the comments
[1:09:26] where it says and the hearts of the
[1:09:27] children unto the fathers
[1:09:32] because only the first part pertained to
[1:09:34] the first election
[1:09:36] to the first four runs
[1:09:39] of the first coming of jesus christ
[1:09:44] then a period of about 1900 years passes
[1:10:00] and returning
[1:10:14] of the deity of jesus christ
[1:10:17] they received the holy ghost
[1:10:21] and it also says those were the
[1:10:22] apostolic fathers
[1:10:25] both apostles
[1:10:43] and that's brother brandon that's taking
[1:10:45] us back to what they had
[1:10:49] that's why we believe in this message
[1:10:54] it's taken us back to what was already
[1:10:55] written in the bible
[1:11:24] and
[1:11:40] i know that works behold i've said
[1:11:42] before the an open door
[1:11:50] and no man can shut it for thou has
[1:11:52] little strength and has kept my word and
[1:11:54] has not denied my name
[1:11:57] now throughout the ages
[1:11:59] they started off right
[1:12:03] with that pentecostal doctrine
[1:12:06] that the person has to be born again
[1:12:10] and they also have the apostolic
[1:12:11] doctrines
[1:12:14] which were the revelations of the mind
[1:12:15] of god
[1:12:17] and as the time passed
[1:12:19] the devil entered in
[1:12:23] and started to give them wrong doctrine
[1:12:28] those wrong doctrines
[1:12:32] they weakened and killed the church
[1:13:02] philadelphia
[1:13:31] for god
[1:13:33] has not denied my name
[1:13:38] god's name is very important
[1:13:43] in first john 5 7-8
[1:13:54] for these are three that bear record in
[1:13:55] heaven the father the word and the holy
[1:13:57] ghost and these three are won
[1:14:02] jesus now remember when jesus
[1:14:05] he commissioned the disciples
[1:14:08] he said to go into every nation
[1:14:12] to go and baptize in the name of the
[1:14:14] father son and the holy ghost
[1:14:16] but there's no one here
[1:14:19] that has the name father
[1:14:22] is there anyone here whose name is son
[1:14:26] is there anyone here with the name holy
[1:14:27] ghost
[1:14:29] so those are just titles
[1:14:32] but he said to baptize in the name
[1:14:35] of pentecost and at the day of pentecost
[1:14:39] peter had the revelation
[1:14:56] what was originally left with the
[1:14:57] apostles
[1:15:02] i want to go to joel 1 4.
[1:15:08] this is
[1:15:18] that which the palmer worm hath left the
[1:15:21] locust eaten and that which the locusts
[1:15:23] has left half the cankerworm eaten and
[1:15:25] that which the cankerworm has left half
[1:15:27] the caterpillar eaten
[1:15:29] explicit manifesto brother brandon
[1:15:31] explains this was manifested
[1:15:34] throughout the ages
[1:15:37] these were the foreign
[1:15:38] they entered in
[1:15:41] and they started to kill the tree of
[1:15:43] life
[1:15:45] because when christ was here
[1:15:47] on the earth
[1:15:50] he
[1:16:04] that's in christ
[1:16:27] and i will restore to you the years that
[1:16:29] the locusts have eaten the caker worm
[1:16:30] the caterpillar the palmer worm my great
[1:16:33] army which i sent among you
[1:16:43] it speaks about what these demons of the
[1:16:44] devil did
[1:16:46] even
[1:17:01] what they started to take from the tree
[1:17:02] of life
[1:17:05] what they started to take from the
[1:17:06] church of christ
[1:17:08] now notice what brother branham says
[1:17:12] and the message the restoration of the
[1:17:13] bride tree this is
[1:17:24] four messengers of life restores the
[1:17:26] tree lo captain do you get it
[1:17:56] john wesley
[1:18:09] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:18:12] what was the fourth la palabra the word
[1:18:18] justification justification
[1:18:22] sanctification
[1:18:24] three
[1:18:37] what the word
[1:19:51] he said father sanctify them
[1:19:53] with your truth
[1:19:55] for your word is truth
[1:19:58] but then the third stage came
[1:20:01] which was pentecost
[1:20:31] then come along wesley
[1:20:34] stronger
[1:20:35] sanctification
[1:20:40] after wesley came stronger than him
[1:20:41] pentecostal baptism
[1:20:44] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:20:47] in another great prophet
[1:20:50] but in the last days
[1:20:53] of malachi 4.
[1:20:56] elijah is to come with the very word la
[1:20:58] palabra
[1:21:40] restore
[1:21:55] vino de lamente de vios that came from
[1:21:57] god's mind
[1:21:59] que vino de la caveza that came from the
[1:22:01] head
[1:22:04] because we were always in god's thoughts
[1:22:08] now we've
[1:22:22] which is recorded in the message
[1:22:26] what is it
[1:22:28] that holy ghost bunch sieno pulido para
[1:22:30] que pueda cuadrar con la misma clase de
[1:22:33] ministerio being honed out so it can
[1:22:35] fill with the same kind of ministry
[1:22:39] he had when he went away
[1:22:41] when he comes back
[1:22:45] it'll catch the whole thing in the
[1:22:47] rapture
[1:22:48] just
[1:22:49] where the justified
[1:22:51] sanctified
[1:22:54] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:22:59] will stand again
[1:23:02] the house of god will live again
[1:23:16] it takes you to baptism of the holy
[1:23:18] ghost
[1:23:47] that's why we have the stature of a
[1:23:48] perfect man in form of pyramid in the
[1:23:50] form of a pyramid
[1:23:52] that's why the new jerusalem it's
[1:23:54] informative it's in the form of a
[1:23:55] pyramid
[1:23:56] representative
[1:24:00] the
[1:24:14] it will take us into the millennium
[1:24:16] millennium showing in the millennials
[1:24:20] that you accepted the trumpet
[1:24:23] and decided
[1:24:25] to the possession
[1:24:28] that was
[1:24:42] that you want to eat of that tree of
[1:24:44] life
[1:24:45] which is christ
[1:24:50] see that pyramid will once again
[1:24:56] we'll stand again the house of god will
[1:24:57] live again
[1:25:01] the tree of life is growing again
[1:25:05] now notice this and we're ending
[1:25:07] an apocalypse
[1:25:08] in revelation 3 12. this is
[1:25:23] and i will write upon him the name of my
[1:25:25] god
[1:25:27] and the name of the city of my god
[1:25:30] which is the new jerusalem
[1:25:35] which cometh down out of uh from heaven
[1:25:37] of my god and my new name
[1:25:41] remember the trumpet of the jubilee
[1:25:45] is taking you back to a possession
[1:25:50] today
[1:25:52] it's taken you back to what the apostles
[1:25:54] had la el bautismo del espirito santo
[1:25:57] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:25:59] the revelations of jesus christ
[1:26:02] now in ephesians 2.
[1:26:05] verse 19.
[1:26:17] but fellow citizens with the saints and
[1:26:19] of the household of god
[1:26:35] represent the place where you'll live in
[1:26:36] the future
[1:26:42] and are built upon the foundation of the
[1:26:44] apostles and the prophets
[1:26:47] and what foundation did they have
[1:27:02] jesus christ himself being the chief
[1:27:04] cornerstone apocalypse
[1:27:06] now in revelation 21.
[1:27:13] talking about that great city that's in
[1:27:14] the form of a pyramid
[1:27:16] spiritual
[1:27:23] and he carried me away in the spirit to
[1:27:25] a great and high mountain and showed me
[1:27:27] the great city the holy jerusalem
[1:27:29] descending out of heaven from god
[1:27:34] now it's talking about this city
[1:27:37] in verse 14.
[1:27:42] and the wall of the city had 12
[1:27:44] foundations
[1:27:47] and upon them the twelve names de los
[1:27:49] dosse apostoles del cordero of the
[1:27:52] apostles of the lamb
[1:27:55] usted
[1:27:56] you today
[1:28:00] you're being built upon the revelations
[1:28:01] of jesus christ
[1:28:04] that's the foundation that you need is
[1:28:06] the position that's the possession
[1:28:11] where malachi 4-5 esta
[1:28:26] in the spiritual
[1:28:28] natural but in the natural gondola
[1:28:30] when it talks about that city
[1:28:34] says it has twelve foundations
[1:28:36] which are the twelve apostles
[1:28:39] so as you can see estimated
[1:28:53] because today you live in christ
[1:28:57] you're now a citizen
[1:29:00] it's not that on that day you'll become
[1:29:02] a citizen
[1:29:04] you already are
[1:29:08] and the foundation
[1:29:21] it was the revelations of jesus christ
[1:30:04] so that we do not get discouraged
[1:30:07] because there's great things that await
[1:30:09] us in the future
[1:30:11] help these young people
[1:30:13] to be able to understand what is the
[1:30:15] position
[1:30:16] what is the position they have
[1:30:20] if they decide to accept jesus christ
[1:30:24] of the lord
[1:30:27] for we ask it in the name of the lord
[1:30:28] jesus christ amen amen
