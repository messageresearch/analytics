[29:18] [Music]

[29:33] but not from our minds
[29:38] God gave them his songs

[29:59] [Music]
[30:14] Jesus are safe savior

[31:12] aside from above
[31:17] all the wings
[31:23] oh on the wings
[31:31] foreign
[31:48] [Music]
[32:07] to see what our Prophet had to go
[32:10] through to write that verse of the song
[32:16] is
[32:18] I believe that we could all put our our
[32:22] lives in that song
[32:26] that without that snow white dove
[32:30] Paloma Blanca I don't know where I would
[32:34] be at
[32:35] I don't I don't know what position what
[32:38] place I would be at today
[32:42] brother I I've always known the the
[32:45] blood of Jesus Christ
[32:49] and I've always known that Jesus loved
[32:54] but it was when when Jesus became a
[32:58] reality to me
[33:00] [Music]
[33:02] when Jesus became a reality in that snow
[33:05] white dove Jesus
[33:10] then my life changed foreign
[33:45] [Music]
[33:51] turn with me to First John
[33:54] De Juan
[33:56] chapter 4 and verse 19.
[34:01] I'm going to be going to two scriptures
[34:04] tonight
[34:08] first one is in John the second in
[34:11] Ephesians 2.
[34:17] thank you
[34:19] first John 4 19.
[34:27] the Bible says
[34:30] we love him because he first loved us
[34:37] I'm going to repeat that again
[34:40] we loved him
[34:43] or we love him because he first loved us
[34:49] I have this marked in my Bible
[34:53] this is the Bible that I get I used when
[34:56] I gave my heart to the Lord
[35:00] and I made sure to mark this scripture
[35:03] down
[35:05] because I had to be reminded
[35:09] that the only reason I love my Lord
[35:14] is because he first loved me
[35:18] I encourage all the young people and
[35:21] everybody too just Mark that scripture
[35:22] down and remember it
[35:28] I love him because he first loved me
[35:34] Ephesians
[35:36] chapter 2 and verse 8.
[35:40] now this is another one that I I have it
[35:43] marked down
[35:46] because I based my salvation on this
[35:52] is fundamental it says for by Grace you
[35:56] are saved through faith not of
[35:59] yourselves it is a gift of God
[36:08] not of Works lest any man should boast
[36:14] let us bow our heads
[36:19] heavenly father father Celestial Lord
[36:22] we're thankful that you brought us here
[36:24] this evening Lord
[36:27] father we come here unworthy father
[36:32] unworthy in our flesh
[36:35] but Lord knowing your word father
[36:40] that Lord you brought us back with the
[36:43] price
[36:45] you did everything you could to bring us
[36:48] back
[36:51] lord so we come here boldly to your
[36:53] throne of grace
[36:57] knowing father that whatever we ask Lord
[37:01] it shall be given
[37:04] Lord I ask that your presence be known
[37:08] here tonight father
[37:12] that your presence be known to each and
[37:14] every person that is expecting father
[37:21] Lord that you may help us and give us
[37:24] what we need so that we can leave here
[37:26] different fathers
[37:31] Lord we put ourselves in your hands
[37:34] father your capable hands
[37:37] we thank you Lord
[37:39] in the name of Jesus Christ we pray
[37:44] amen and amen amen amen amen God bless
[37:47] each and every one of you okay
[37:53] we love him because he first loved us
[37:58] that that is
[38:00] um such a simple yet such a tremendous
[38:03] scripture to me
[38:07] because
[38:08] to realize that God's love isn't like
[38:11] our love is
[38:18] his love is not a reactional love
[38:23] see every every person that I've out
[38:27] I've Loved ever in my life
[38:30] has been caused by a reaction and
[38:34] building of a relationship
[38:40] that's that's how we begin to to love
[38:43] somebody
[38:45] before I was able to love my wife I I
[38:49] had to talk to her first
[38:54] I I had to see who she was and I had to
[38:57] see her character and she had to see who
[38:59] I was
[39:03] and then over the time of our
[39:07] relationship love began to come on the
[39:11] scene
[39:16] but with God God always loved
[39:21] God didn't love you because you became a
[39:27] Christiano God didn't start loving you
[39:29] when you said I'm going to give my life
[39:31] right with the Lord
[39:36] the Bible says God is love
[39:40] is Amor so even before the foundation of
[39:43] the world
[39:46] even before the world was even made
[39:51] God
[39:54] loves you
[39:56] oh in my condition
[39:59] oh with my issues that I'm going through
[40:01] my mental breakdowns
[40:06] with my hatred that I have in my heart
[40:10] with the things that I've been doing
[40:14] God already loved us
[40:17] because his love is not Performance
[40:20] Based
[40:24] God's love isn't just it isn't based on
[40:28] how good you're going to be or how good
[40:30] you are
[40:35] but God's love is an eternal love and it
[40:38] has never began or never ended
[40:44] so it's such a beautiful scripture to me
[40:49] to know we love him because he first
[40:53] loved us that's a reaction to his love
[40:56] is
[41:03] why we're here today
[41:06] I I first I I want to express what a
[41:10] beautiful thing it is to be here in the
[41:11] house of the Lord
[41:16] to be with people that believe in the
[41:19] truth
[41:22] to know that God's presence is in this
[41:25] place
[41:29] what a reality it is
[41:31] to know that Jesus is here
[41:35] Jesus is here tonight Jesus
[41:39] man if that can be a reality in our
[41:42] hearts today
[41:46] that Jesus is here
[41:49] mostly every place outside of this
[41:53] church
[41:56] there's bad spirits everywhere
[42:00] at the stores
[42:02] at the gas station
[42:04] wherever you go there's bad
[42:09] but to know that there is a place
[42:13] a place that that the presence of God is
[42:17] here
[42:21] and it's called church
[42:23] when I was a child
[42:26] and you know where I would have my best
[42:29] sleep set is
[42:31] it was under the bench
[42:33] and I just remember having the most
[42:36] beautiful dreams
[42:39] and sometimes I remember my mom carrying
[42:42] me I I don't know how I remember
[42:49] I must have been two or three I don't
[42:52] know
[42:54] but I remember my mom carrying me to
[42:57] church
[43:00] then in a in a twinkling of an eye I
[43:03] remember her taking me out of church
[43:08] and I would think to myself it's like we
[43:10] just came to church why are we we living
[43:12] already
[43:16] I was sleeping under the presence of the
[43:19] Lord
[43:21] I was enjoying myself
[43:24] yeah and whenever I was a teenager I've
[43:27] said this story before
[43:29] and
[43:31] whenever I was a rebel and I would do
[43:34] things out in the world and in school
[43:39] I would come to church
[43:42] and I would feel such a presence of the
[43:45] Lord
[43:47] oh man when the preaching would go
[43:50] forward
[43:52] the conviction would hit my heart
[43:56] every song would just hit me and hit me
[44:02] but I knew I knew there was a fact
[44:06] that if I left those doors
[44:11] if I left those doors
[44:13] I would go back to the sin that I was in
[44:41] let me
[44:45] stay here and let me just stay here
[44:47] because if I stay here I know I won't
[44:50] sin anymore
[44:54] I knew if I left
[44:56] this church or the church that I was in
[44:59] I would go and sin again
[45:05] and it reminds me of the disciples that
[45:08] were with Jesus
[45:11] it reminded me of Jesus what they they
[45:15] said about him
[45:19] they said that he was God With Us
[45:24] that when he was with his disciples he
[45:27] was the Emmanuel is
[45:33] the disciples they rejoiced with the
[45:36] Lord
[45:37] because the Lord was with us
[45:41] the Lord was everywhere they went
[45:47] they sat under him as he as he preached
[45:51] and he taught the word
[45:55] they saw him do Miracles
[45:59] they felt his presence
[46:03] the Bible said that John slept on his
[46:06] chest
[46:09] what a beautiful thing to be with Jesus
[46:13] Christ
[46:17] see it was a beautiful presence when he
[46:20] was there
[46:22] and I feel sometimes that that's the
[46:26] feeling of whenever we go to these great
[46:28] camps that we have yeah
[46:35] that we go and we have such a walk with
[46:39] God
[46:42] we feel the presence of the Lord
[46:46] we feel so close to him that we could
[46:49] hear him talk to us but
[46:55] but every time
[46:58] I would hear stories
[47:00] I would hear stories of whenever they
[47:03] would have to leave
[47:08] when they left
[47:09] [Music]
[47:10] the world hit them like a ton of bricks
[47:16] see Jesus was with them they were with
[47:19] Jesus
[47:22] see I was with Jesus in the pews
[47:26] but I left him at the doorstep
[47:32] I didn't I truly didn't want to serve
[47:35] the Lord all the way
[47:39] because I love the world a little too
[47:42] much
[47:44] so so every time I would feel the
[47:47] presence of the Lord
[47:50] I would Rejoice
[47:53] I would give God all the honor and the
[47:55] glory adios
[47:58] but then I would leave him at the
[48:00] doorstep
[48:03] the disciples they rejoiced with the
[48:06] Lord
[48:12] but whenever he died
[48:15] what did they do
[48:18] whenever he was crucified crucified
[48:21] Peter rejected him
[48:24] the disciples they ran away
[48:28] Jesus was gone and he was out of the
[48:31] scene Jesus
[48:34] what did Peter do Pedro let's look at
[48:38] into Peter's life real quick
[48:42] Jesus dies okay
[48:45] of course in the third day he rises
[48:47] again
[48:51] but Peter being Peter Pedro he says I'm
[48:55] going to go fishing again
[48:58] he says you know what Jesus is gone I'm
[49:00] gonna go fishing
[49:04] and it's very interesting for me to
[49:07] think about what Peter did
[49:13] because Peter he was a fisherman
[49:18] that's the best thing he could do that
[49:21] was his profession
[49:26] that's what he excelled in
[49:30] so when he left Jesus now think about it
[49:36] when he left Jesus Jesus when Jesus was
[49:40] off of the scene Jesus
[49:43] he did the thing that that he couldn't
[49:47] do the very best
[49:52] he went back to his profession
[49:56] he went back to his
[50:00] he went back to fishing
[50:03] this is the best thing that he can do he
[50:06] was a fisherman he was a professional is
[50:12] but after he leaves Jesus
[50:16] he goes fishing
[50:19] and he doesn't catch anything
[50:23] now think about it
[50:25] the best thing that that Peter can ever
[50:29] do
[50:31] his best expression is a fisherman
[50:36] yeah when he leaves Jesus he cannot
[50:39] catch anything
[50:43] that's that's the feeling of when we
[50:46] leave Jesus
[50:49] that's the feeling when we feel when we
[50:52] leave the camps and we leave Jesus at
[50:55] Camp yes
[51:00] sure we leave Jesus where we left or we
[51:04] leave Jesus at the pulpit or at the at
[51:07] the altar Jesus
[51:10] and when we try to go and live the world
[51:14] in the world it's not going to be the
[51:16] same anymore
[51:22] and and uh my my concern is
[51:26] My Cry is
[51:29] that that this the thing it doesn't
[51:33] become normal
[51:35] because they went to they got a point in
[51:39] my life
[51:41] when I was out in the world
[51:44] that leaving the presence of the Lord in
[51:47] church became normal to me
[51:52] that that I could I could do my little
[51:55] religious thing and then I can go to the
[51:57] world
[52:01] I I could I I had
[52:04] um church clothes in my closet I just
[52:07] had to pick a suit and I had I looked
[52:09] just like a Christian
[52:14] um
[52:16] and it becomes normal after a while
[52:19] leaving Christ at the door is
[52:25] the situation is
[52:28] what brother Branham says
[52:32] that that when we leave these doors we
[52:35] leave the the doors of the church
[52:40] this is a hard reality
[52:44] that we either get better
[52:47] or we get worse
[52:50] so every time we leave Christ at the
[52:53] door
[52:56] stay the same but it gets worse and
[52:59] worse and worse
[53:04] if if we continue to
[53:07] grow our relationship with the Lord it
[53:10] gets better every time we leave those
[53:12] doors
[53:13] is so
[53:23] um my title this evening is Jesus wants
[53:27] a relationship not a religion
[53:30] Jesus
[53:33] very simple topic
[53:35] but I just
[53:38] I I want to speak from from my heart and
[53:41] from my experiences
[53:45] and the the one thing that Jesus hates
[53:50] Jesus is religion is now religion let's
[53:56] I'll break it down what religion is
[54:01] in the Merriam-Webster it says it's an
[54:04] organized system of beliefs and
[54:06] practices
[54:11] practices rituals and symbols designed
[54:15] to facilitate the closeness and
[54:17] sacredness to the Transcendent God
[54:19] higher power or ultimate truth or
[54:21] reality
[54:23] is
[54:33] so it's a practice or a ritual
[54:38] in order to get closer to God
[54:42] now there is a True Religion
[54:46] I don't want people to walk out of here
[54:49] and say ah religion is bad okay
[54:53] there is a True Religion
[54:57] there is things that we have to do
[55:02] do you remember what those things are
[55:06] those Commandments
[55:09] baptism
[55:16] those are religious acts
[55:19] but that's true religion there is
[55:23] even the way we get baptized there's a
[55:26] certain way we get baptized in certain
[55:28] in one name
[55:30] is
[55:35] says there is a old-time religion
[55:38] there's an original religion this is
[55:45] but religion without relationship that's
[55:49] no bueno no good religion relations
[55:54] religion without relationship is not
[55:56] good
[55:59] for by Grace you are saved this is
[56:04] not of yourselves
[56:07] it's a gift of God
[56:10] not of works
[56:14] because somebody might boast
[56:17] because somebody might Elevate
[56:20] themselves because
[56:22] we begin to play the comparison game
[56:29] because we begin to clothe and hide
[56:32] ourselves in religions
[56:35] we don't want religion
[56:38] we want relationships
[56:42] good works brings a a comparison but but
[56:49] when you get saved it will humble you
[56:52] know
[56:56] religion is what what we can do
[57:01] but relationship is what God already did
[57:06] what can I do for the Lord
[57:10] what can I do how can I make myself look
[57:13] more righteous
[57:15] but the grace of God is what he already
[57:18] did his righteousness
[57:23] I don't lay on my righteousness
[57:28] I'm no good
[57:30] if if I I go in in in
[57:34] am judged by every single one of you
[57:40] I might not be a good Christian in your
[57:44] standards
[57:48] if I judge you fleshly by your
[57:52] righteousness you might not be in my
[57:54] level
[57:58] and and religion it begins to compare
[58:04] and to see ah well you know what I do
[58:07] this and I do that and they don't yeah
[58:15] works and acts and all those things
[58:19] and if I do those things
[58:22] and you don't do those things
[58:25] something's wrong with you
[58:28] they might not be safe
[58:33] yeah something's wrong wrong with them
[58:35] because they don't do exactly what I did
[58:39] exactly that's religion
[58:43] that works
[58:45] by Grace you are saved for gracias
[58:50] what a reality
[58:53] Grace I am safe
[58:56] I don't I don't have to try I don't have
[58:59] to pull and push
[59:03] it's what God already did for me
[59:08] we judge a people by their morals
[59:11] instead of looking at them through
[59:12] Christ
[59:15] Morales
[59:18] have you ever felt better about yourself
[59:21] when you see somebody
[59:23] falling
[59:27] have you ever felt like oh man see I'm a
[59:32] good Christian look at them
[59:36] that's religion
[59:38] have you seen a marriage that that's
[59:41] struggling and it may it validates your
[59:44] marriage
[59:51] that's religion
[59:53] have you ever seen anybody that's just
[59:57] not right and it just elevates you just
[1:00:00] a little higher
[1:00:05] that's religion
[1:00:28] because the grace of God you can't find
[1:00:30] it
[1:00:32] it's impossible it's impossible it's
[1:00:35] impossible to please God by my works
[1:00:41] when the grace of God finds you entonces
[1:00:46] something happens
[1:00:49] you realize how unworthy you are
[1:00:55] not how better you are
[1:00:59] if that's the case something's wrong
[1:01:05] and when you find the grace of God we
[1:01:07] realize how below the mark we've been
[1:01:10] living
[1:01:16] and how grateful we are because Jesus
[1:01:19] Paid the price
[1:01:22] Jesus that I don't have to live off of
[1:01:26] my righteousness I live off of his
[1:01:28] righteousness so
[1:01:34] so I I'm I throw my righteousness away
[1:01:40] Isaiah it says we are all as unclean
[1:01:44] thing and our righteousness has filthy
[1:01:47] rags
[1:01:56] that's that's a good thing for me
[1:01:59] that my righteousness to God
[1:02:03] is filthy ragsia
[1:02:07] that makes me feel good it might it
[1:02:10] might burn
[1:02:13] but I realized one thing
[1:02:17] that I don't have to carry the burden of
[1:02:20] trying to be righteous
[1:02:24] to be saved
[1:02:27] I don't have to carry the burden of
[1:02:29] trying to be good to be safe
[1:02:35] because everything I do and anything I
[1:02:38] do
[1:02:41] paradios
[1:02:45] it doesn't work
[1:02:47] you can try you can try you can try it
[1:02:50] does not work and
[1:02:56] what happens is when we try to do that
[1:02:59] when we try to be righteous
[1:03:03] we begin to lose the Christian the
[1:03:07] characteristics of Christian Joy
[1:03:10] characteristics
[1:03:12] because we begin to think that we have
[1:03:15] to save ourselves
[1:03:21] we begin to lose our joy because we try
[1:03:24] to appear goodness
[1:03:30] now I I just want to be real here today
[1:03:33] I want God to speak to us today
[1:03:37] it's it's all right if somebody's going
[1:03:41] through that is
[1:03:43] it's okay if somebody's trying to be
[1:03:46] religious
[1:03:48] it's okay to let go of that
[1:03:51] religiousness
[1:03:55] it's okay to let go of that
[1:03:58] righteousness
[1:04:01] God doesn't like it
[1:04:03] it's filthy
[1:04:05] ragsia you know what is
[1:04:09] we
[1:04:12] it seems like the churches they they
[1:04:16] celebrate good morals is
[1:04:21] they celebrate uh
[1:04:24] the way people act and the way people do
[1:04:27] things
[1:04:32] now we've seen it everywhere
[1:04:37] that brother uh he ties that brother oh
[1:04:40] definitely he's going to be saved
[1:04:46] oh well those people man they're good
[1:04:56] we begin to judge people by their good
[1:05:00] works instead of or we begin to
[1:05:02] celebrate their good works instead of
[1:05:04] celebrate their Brokenness
[1:05:12] now Jesus came to save the broken
[1:05:17] this is a hospital
[1:05:20] I I don't if what if this was a hospital
[1:05:26] and all of you guys were fine and
[1:05:29] healthy history
[1:05:35] what are you doing here
[1:05:38] this is for the broken is
[1:05:41] we come here to fix
[1:05:44] we come here to help
[1:05:47] we come here to you something's wrong
[1:05:50] with you let's bring them in let's bring
[1:05:51] them in
[1:05:55] but we come to the point where we say
[1:05:58] well you know what all of you guys are
[1:06:00] good but they're bad they sit in the
[1:06:01] back of the church
[1:06:07] and we begin to celebrate good morals
[1:06:13] instead of celebrating the righteousness
[1:06:16] of Jesus Christ
[1:06:21] now it's just a good thought I've seen
[1:06:23] it many times
[1:06:28] everywhere
[1:06:30] you know I've been guilty of that yes
[1:06:34] I've been guilty of comparing myself
[1:06:39] I've been guilty of thinking I was less
[1:06:43] than somebody
[1:06:47] and I've been guilty of thinking I was
[1:06:49] better than someone
[1:06:55] we got to be real
[1:06:58] but but
[1:07:00] we the Bible says we have to judge
[1:07:03] people by seeing them in Christ
[1:07:09] if we see somebody falling instead of
[1:07:13] seeing their works we judge them by
[1:07:15] Jesus Christ
[1:07:24] in this message leadership
[1:07:28] it's uh preached in 1965 I believe in
[1:07:33] October October 31st Halloween
[1:07:42] um and he's preaching he's actually
[1:07:44] speaking to uh the young people here and
[1:07:47] so it's a beautiful message
[1:07:54] he says your priest Your Leader or so
[1:07:58] forth
[1:08:02] can teach your religion foreign
[1:08:07] [Music]
[1:08:40] none
[1:08:42] he's here right now
[1:08:45] you've got to accept him here right now
[1:08:51] he's here
[1:08:53] he's a Persona in the form of the Holy
[1:08:57] Ghost
[1:08:58] you have to accept the person of Jesus
[1:09:02] Christ
[1:09:05] you understand that all of you
[1:09:08] got to accept the person of Jesus Christ
[1:09:12] to have eternal life
[1:09:16] now I could teach you I could teach you
[1:09:19] how to live right
[1:09:22] brother we can get some speakers to
[1:09:24] teach you how to learn social cues
[1:09:31] how to look good as a
[1:09:35] Christiano what to wear when you come to
[1:09:37] church
[1:09:42] something I could teach you how you
[1:09:44] gotta hold eye contact to be respectful
[1:09:46] to somebody conversations
[1:09:52] I could teach you to look good as a
[1:09:55] Christian
[1:09:58] but we're here to preach Jesus Christ
[1:10:03] we're here to preach Jesus Christ and
[1:10:05] his righteousness alone
[1:10:10] it's only him it's only his
[1:10:14] righteousness
[1:10:15] I could live here knowing
[1:10:19] that
[1:10:20] I am safe
[1:10:23] no matter what anybody says
[1:10:27] no matter what I even say how critical I
[1:10:30] am about myself
[1:10:34] how unworthy I feel
[1:10:38] that doesn't matter
[1:10:40] Jesus died for you
[1:10:45] so that I don't have to worry about my
[1:10:48] righteousness anymore
[1:10:51] you don't have to feel pressure to to
[1:10:54] live under these certain codes
[1:11:01] man living like every day is uh uh what
[1:11:06] is it called um New Year's resolution

[1:11:47] Wednesday yeah we're kicking our dogs
[1:11:52] we don't even want to talk to our own
[1:11:55] family members
[1:11:58] why because we're under the pressure of
[1:12:01] religion
[1:12:03] under the pressure of self-righteousness
[1:12:09] get that off of us
[1:12:12] let's get that off of us
[1:12:15] what a uh
[1:12:18] enslaved mindset that is
[1:12:22] what a burden that is
[1:12:24] to carry righteousness for your own
[1:12:28] salvation
[1:12:32] salvation and that is a big burden to
[1:12:35] character
[1:12:38] that's big to carry
[1:12:41] brother Brown says religion won't give
[1:12:45] you eternal life
[1:12:50] he said he said instead of trying to
[1:12:52] hold on to God let him hold on to you
[1:12:59] every day we're trying to hold on to our
[1:13:03] religion hold on to God
[1:13:09] when it came down to brother branham's
[1:13:12] worst day
[1:13:16] when his
[1:13:18] wife and his daughter passed away
[1:13:22] and they were there at the tomb and and
[1:13:25] the preacher was preaching ashes to
[1:13:27] ashes and dusted us
[1:13:35] at his lowest point is
[1:13:41] didn't know what to do
[1:13:44] Branham brother Brandon wanted to take
[1:13:46] his own life
[1:13:49] think about it
[1:13:52] but then here comes the preacher
[1:13:55] Here Comes this man
[1:13:57] he said after everything you've gone
[1:14:00] through right now
[1:14:03] you lost your dad
[1:14:06] you lost your brother
[1:14:08] now you lost your wife and your daughter
[1:14:13] esposa you have to take care of your son
[1:14:15] by yourself
[1:14:18] after all of that can you still hold on
[1:14:22] to your religion they said this place
[1:14:28] my religion has got a hold of me
[1:14:33] after where I brother Brandon says when
[1:14:36] he wanted to let go
[1:14:39] when he wanted to say it's over
[1:14:45] it was God holding on to him
[1:14:49] that's Grace
[1:14:51] that's not merited
[1:14:55] that's not something that I can work my
[1:14:59] way to that
[1:15:02] it's by grace and grace alone
[1:15:06] we are saved by grace
[1:15:11] if you don't feel safe
[1:15:14] it doesn't matter
[1:15:16] if you believe it
[1:15:18] you are saved by faith or by faith what
[1:15:23] did it say
[1:15:24] you are saved by grace through faith
[1:15:30] all you got to do is believe it
[1:15:33] I don't feel it
[1:15:35] my life doesn't walk according to it
[1:15:41] believe it
[1:15:44] believe that you are saved and you are
[1:15:47] right now
[1:15:50] Jesus doesn't love you because you may
[1:15:53] you turned a new Leaf Jesus
[1:15:57] Jesus doesn't love you because you've
[1:15:59] made your decision today
[1:16:04] Jesus always
[1:16:06] Jesus loved you at your worst Jesus
[1:16:11] Jesus loves you at your worst conditions
[1:16:18] well how do I begin to have a
[1:16:22] relationship with God
[1:16:26] how do I take them out of the the church
[1:16:29] and take them with me
[1:16:33] understand
[1:16:36] that Jesus loved you first
[1:16:41] and when you realize Jesus
[1:16:48] we'll love him because he loved us
[1:16:53] I love him because he loves me first
[1:16:57] what a beautiful thing
[1:17:00] there's this brother I don't ever I
[1:17:02] don't know if anybody knows who he is
[1:17:04] he's not from the message
[1:17:08] he's a Baptist preacher his name is Paul
[1:17:11] Washer
[1:17:13] is Paul Washer I came across this quote
[1:17:16] and I just want to quote it to you
[1:17:20] he says a lot of people think that
[1:17:23] Christianity is you doing all the
[1:17:26] righteous things you hate this is
[1:17:34] and avoiding all the wicked things you
[1:17:37] love in order to go to heaven
[1:17:42] no that's a lost man with religion he
[1:17:46] said
[1:17:48] a Christian
[1:17:50] is a person whose heart has been changed
[1:17:54] and they have new affections
[1:18:01] it doesn't it seem like we when we're
[1:18:05] not serving the lord we should that um
[1:18:08] the way we should be
[1:18:11] understood
[1:18:13] that we're doing everything that we
[1:18:15] don't want to do
[1:18:20] ah church again
[1:18:23] dragging our feet to church
[1:18:27] putting on the Christian faith
[1:18:30] Christiano I gotta do my duty thing okay
[1:18:34] do you think do you think somebody
[1:18:38] somebody in the weekend
[1:18:40] today is Friday oh yes anybody that's
[1:18:44] been in the world knows what Friday
[1:18:46] means to a worldly
[1:18:48] Persona
[1:18:50] representative
[1:18:52] it's the weekend
[1:18:55] I don't have to work tomorrow
[1:19:00] let's say his buddy calls him
[1:19:04] hey there's a big party over here in
[1:19:07] soso's house
[1:19:11] so and so is here and we've got so much
[1:19:16] drinks here
[1:19:17] and we're playing really loud music yes
[1:19:21] come on man let's go bente you think
[1:19:25] somebody that would be in the world
[1:19:28] do you think that would be like ah I

[1:19:47] pick me up do you need help
[1:19:52] you need help buying some beer do you
[1:19:54] need help doing this
[1:19:57] why that's his nature
[1:20:01] that's what he loves to do
[1:20:04] so why do Christians drag their feet to
[1:20:07] come in churches
[1:20:11] there's a different nature going on oh
[1:20:14] you're not different

[1:21:36] whatever happens I'm going to church for
[1:21:39] Jesus
[1:21:43] that's what church is about
[1:21:47] church is about Jesus
[1:21:50] we take our Focus out sometimes and we
[1:21:53] put it on somebody else
[1:21:57] oh I don't like going to church she
[1:22:00] worships too loud
[1:22:13] whatever happens I don't care I want to
[1:22:16] see Jesus
[1:22:20] man when we get that relationship with
[1:22:23] the Lord
[1:22:25] rain shine good bad I don't care I want
[1:22:29] Jesus Christ
[1:22:35] what a beautiful what a beautiful
[1:22:38] picture it is today of a consecrated
[1:22:40] life
[1:22:45] who once enters into into with Christ
[1:22:51] dead to the things of the world
[1:22:54] get away with God
[1:22:57] and the veil dropped around them
[1:23:02] and all the world
[1:23:09] I don't care what my neighbor does
[1:23:13] I love them anyways
[1:23:16] I don't care what's going on I love them
[1:23:19] anyways I'm here for Jesus I'm shutting
[1:23:22] with him
[1:23:27] brother Brown says Christianity and
[1:23:30] religion becomes a pleasure to every
[1:23:33] believer then this is
[1:23:40] today people just have religion just to
[1:23:44] make them miserable just enough religion
[1:23:47] to make themselves miserable this is
[1:23:54] knowing they ought to do it they're
[1:23:57] trying to escape
[1:24:00] hellos
[1:24:02] it's not
[1:24:07] don't be a
[1:24:09] ble to serve him and don't say nothing
[1:24:13] serve him because you love him
[1:24:16] get that relationship with him then
[1:24:19] it becomes easy to serve him every
[1:24:22] single day
[1:24:26] and if you happen to fall is
[1:24:32] dust your feet and go again
[1:24:36] because it's not based on your
[1:24:39] righteousness
[1:24:41] it's based on the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:24:45] and what he did for you
[1:24:50] therefore there is no more condemnation
[1:24:53] to those that are in Christ Jesus
[1:24:58] Christ when you're in Christ there is no
[1:25:01] more condemnation
[1:25:05] Oh what a beautiful thing
[1:25:08] we're happy and safe when we're in
[1:25:10] church but let's put him inside is
[1:25:18] don't leave them out there
[1:25:21] in closing yeah
[1:25:23] Jesus told the disciples Jesus
[1:25:27] said you the world shall see me no more
[1:25:32] he said after a little while you're not
[1:25:34] going to be able to see me anymore
[1:25:39] what was he saying
[1:25:41] he was physically leaving the scene
[1:25:46] the disciples said don't don't go don't
[1:25:49] go
[1:25:52] you they were focusing on God with them
[1:25:58] but he said after a little while
[1:26:02] the comforter shall come down
[1:26:05] for he will be in you then
[1:26:09] wherever you go
[1:26:12] he will be with you
[1:26:16] Jesus Jesus after he died and he rose
[1:26:19] again
[1:26:21] he found Peter fishing
[1:26:25] he found Peter broken
[1:26:29] he found Peter the way he saw him when
[1:26:32] Peter denied him
[1:26:36] do you think God Stopped Loving Him
[1:26:40] Do You Think Jesus said you know what
[1:26:42] you failed me Peter Jesus
[1:26:46] oh Jesus loved him because his love is
[1:26:49] not based on our performance Jesus
[1:26:56] the start of your relationship with God
[1:26:58] is God loving you first
[1:27:03] he goes to Peter right before he leaves
[1:27:09] Peter do you love me Elizabeth
[1:27:13] Peter do you love me Peter it is
[1:27:16] yes Lord I love you
[1:27:20] we can't love Jesus if we tried foreign
[1:27:46] Peter was saying yes I love you but he
[1:27:49] was using the word Ophelia
[1:28:14] Jesus knows that he you can go so far
[1:28:18] just as yourself
[1:28:33] until he received Christ in him
[1:28:37] if you like to stand with me and the
[1:28:39] musicians come up
[1:28:43] it's the Christ in us it's Christian
[1:28:47] Nosotros do you love Jesus
[1:28:51] it's because it's Christ in you working
[1:28:54] inside your life
[1:28:59] it's your your maturity as a Christian
[1:29:03] is all relationship based
[1:29:08] and nothing else
[1:29:10] your revelation of the word is
[1:29:13] relationship based
[1:29:19] he typed the religion
[1:29:23] I'm sorry he typed the Revelation
[1:29:27] Revelation to him and his wife loving
[1:29:30] each other so much
[1:29:33] that whenever she would write him a
[1:29:36] letter
[1:29:37] she would say yeah I just put the kids
[1:29:39] to sleep
[1:29:42] I'm sitting next to the fire
[1:29:46] it was such a simple text
[1:29:49] but he loved her so much
[1:29:53] that he began to read in between the
[1:29:55] lines
[1:29:56] and he knew exactly what she was saying
[1:30:02] relationship it brings a revelation to
[1:30:06] God to the word to Jesus Christ
[1:30:13] you know what I've realized
[1:30:16] I can't explain the message to people
[1:30:21] I can't explain the Mysteries to people
[1:30:27] why porque because it's only given by
[1:30:31] Revelation
[1:30:32] Revelation and it's only given by
[1:30:36] Revelation through a relationship with
[1:30:38] Christ
[1:30:41] the maturity of a Christian is adoption
[1:30:45] to Sons
[1:30:48] think about it well we're not matured
[1:30:53] into these these great formal Christians
[1:30:59] but we mature to children
[1:31:03] to God saying Dad Dad adios
[1:31:13] that's our maturity
[1:31:16] it's a relationship and it's a it's a
[1:31:19] closed tight relationship with our
[1:31:21] Father God
[1:31:24] he loves you today
[1:31:27] he loves you more than anything you can
[1:31:30] think of
[1:31:33] and maybe we don't know it
[1:31:36] maybe we're still out in the world
[1:31:40] but remember there's somebody that is
[1:31:43] watching you
[1:31:46] I don't know if my brother he thought
[1:31:49] this thought this wrong but I I told him
[1:31:51] Jesus is like a jealous boyfriend
[1:32:01] yeah you can see yeah wherever you go
[1:32:06] maybe you left him at church
[1:32:09] maybe you left him somewhere
[1:32:13] said where is she going
[1:32:17] oh she's sleeping oh why why is he
[1:32:21] talking to them over there
[1:32:24] he gets he gets mad because you're out
[1:32:27] there in the world
[1:32:30] he gets he gets angry when you do the
[1:32:33] things in the of the world
[1:32:36] why because he loves you
[1:32:40] why because he knows that you are his
[1:32:43] child
[1:32:45] you are his bride
[1:32:48] and one of these days
[1:32:51] one of these days you're going to give
[1:32:53] your heart to the Lord
