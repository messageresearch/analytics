[45:03] every one of us is in different stages
[45:08] every one of us has different wounds

[45:22] it's the Holy Spirit a minimum amen
[45:25] Brothers
[45:32] to be so kind we'll be opening our
[45:34] Bibles to the Book of Romans chapter 8
[45:36] verse 14.
[45:47] this morning we would like to thank the
[45:49] Lord Jesus Christ for the life that he

[45:54] and as well to our pastors
[45:59] we're always having that trust in US
[46:05] Aid verse 14.
[46:12] but before we read the Bible let's
[46:15] approach the author of the word
[46:19] a lord Heavenly Father
[46:23] Lord this morning
[46:32] believing that your presence is already
[46:34] here Among Us
[46:40] father every one of us have different
[46:43] desires that are in our hearts
[46:45] we have different struggles
[46:49] we come from different Paths of amen
[47:24] [Music]
[47:47] it says for as many as as are led by the
[47:50] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[47:54] remember this you may be seated
[47:58] God bless the reading of his word yeah
[48:05] this morning we can just place a little
[48:08] title to our talk
[48:12] I would like to call it led by the
[48:15] spirit
[48:21] the way that this message was given to
[48:23] me or the way that I was inspired
[48:29] and I was speaking to your brother and
[48:31] the brother used the phrase
[48:34] he said led by the spirit
[48:38] [Music]
[48:39] and this morning I would like to talk
[48:42] about that
[48:46] the Bible says for as many are as are
[48:49] led by the spirit of God
[48:51] they are the sons of God
[48:56] and this morning we also want to be led
[48:59] by God
[49:01] no
[49:30] foreign
[49:38] amen
[49:54] [Music]
[50:58] not by building some great organization
[51:02] not by doing something else
[51:05] Iglesias making great churches Florida
[51:08] and Flowery
[51:11] altarsos and Flowery speeches
[51:17] but somehow he was led by the spirit of
[51:20] God
[51:22] um
[51:26] and he goes over and he gets a little
[51:29] lamb and wraps a piece of Grapevine
[51:31] around his neck
[51:32] and offered him on the Altar
[51:36] and then notice what brother random says
[51:42] and died on the same altar donde
[51:46] his lamb died on SOS that's a revelation
[51:51] Revelation
[51:55] now brother random says that he was led
[51:57] by God's spirit
[52:00] he got himself a little lamb
[52:03] he tied him with a little grapevine
[52:08] he led him and placed them on the altar
[52:11] Upon A Rocket is
[52:15] [Music]
[52:17] that Abel himself he died on his same
[52:20] altar SOS that's a revelation
[52:26] revelationismo when you die to yourself
[52:32] brother random says
[52:35] the word apocalypse foreign
[52:41] [Music]
[52:59] foreign
[53:32] [Music]
[53:38] and also says
[53:41] so the prophet tells us
[53:43] [Music]
[53:45] this is the first of all Revelations is
[53:50] the deity of Jesus Christ
[53:54] what is the deity of Jesus Christ
[53:59] he's not just merely a problem he's the
[54:03] god Prophet he's the alpha
[54:06] omega he's the Omega
[54:08] that's the first
[54:11] of all the revelations
[54:14] the prophet tells us
[54:17] Vision
[54:20] he says the first of all the revelations
[54:25] is the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ
[54:29] when you understand
[54:33] he's the same yesterday today and
[54:35] forever
[54:36] that's the first one
[54:38] amen
[54:41] the statue is beginning to be unveiled
[54:44] and the prophet says he says You must
[54:48] know who he is
[54:51] when you hear the voice
[54:56] so there's a variety of voices
[55:01] there's not just one side there's many
[55:05] spirits
[55:08] so we must understand
[55:13] or for the first revelation to be
[55:15] revealed to us
[55:18] which is the Supreme deity of Jesus
[55:21] Christ
[55:22] to be able to hear his voice
[55:25] so when the other Spirit then comes
[55:29] he won't get us out of the way
[55:55] sometimes it does happen like that
[55:59] or you might say brother Louise he
[56:01] sounds like brother so and so amen amen
[56:04] says sometimes sometimes voices are very
[56:08] similar one uh to each other
[56:11] but when you know who is Jesus Christ
[56:17] and when another enticing Spirit wants
[56:20] to come over
[56:23] how many know that story
[56:26] brother random he tells the story
[56:30] he says that Martin Luther was studying
[56:37] and he says an angel appeared unto him
[56:40] opposing as Jesus Christ
[56:42] and he said hey worship me Martin Martin
[56:47] I'm your savior
[57:13] so Martin Luther said you're not Jesus
[57:15] Christ
[57:16] because Jesus Christ has not been
[57:18] crowned yet
[57:20] he says Satan depart from me
[57:23] amen Brothers
[57:28] says that his church
[57:33] his entire church is built upon Divine
[57:36] Revelations of himself
[57:40] he's not revealing something else
[57:44] he's revealing himself to his people
[58:02] is to reveal or to make a secret known
[58:05] amen Brothers
[58:12] no one else knows
[58:18] no one else knows that only you know
[58:20] Revelation that's a revelation
[58:23] [Music]
[58:25] no one else knows about this only you
[58:28] know about this
[59:00] the Bible said that Peter was an
[59:02] ignorant and unlearned man
[59:08] he was not a scholar nor a man
[59:12] so the Revelation he got
[59:14] the Revelation isn't learned
[59:27] Revelation is not something that's
[59:29] learned
[59:36] you're not just studying and studying no
[59:38] the Revelation falls on you when God it
[59:40] pleases God to do something
[59:43] so we're all here gathered
[59:46] and everyone here is listening
[59:50] and everyone here is
[59:56] the Revelation falling upon them
[1:00:07] he couldn't even sign his own name
[1:00:11] okay
[1:00:13] so now he's speaking to us then
[1:00:17] I'll give you a secret about myself
[1:00:23] uh sometimes I feel very bad because I
[1:00:25] didn't learn how to write English yes
[1:00:27] by the end it was already taken away
[1:00:31] so when I see the brothers that they
[1:00:33] have such a nice signature
[1:00:37] fake it till I make it right
[1:00:47] just don't tell anyone
[1:00:49] is
[1:00:55] but he keeps saying but it pleased God
[1:00:57] to give him the keys to the kingdom
[1:01:00] because he saw them
[1:01:03] and he knew his evidence
[1:01:11] he believes the word
[1:01:13] Pedro
[1:01:15] yeah
[1:01:20] and Upon This Rock I'll build my church
[1:01:24] so where is this church built upon upon
[1:01:28] Peter
[1:01:31] Pedro it's not on Peter Jesus is it Upon
[1:01:35] Jesus
[1:01:41] amen
[1:01:43] so it's yeah so this is his church
[1:01:46] will be built upon
[1:01:49] not upon Peter what does it say there
[1:02:01] upon his spiritual revelation
[1:02:04] of who he was
[1:02:12] how tremendous is revelation
[1:02:16] it's not upon Peter nor Upon Jesus
[1:02:21] but it's upon the revelations Jesus of
[1:02:24] who Jesus is
[1:02:27] amen
[1:02:32] flesh and blood cannot reveal this
[1:02:35] that's why he said to Peter blessed are
[1:02:38] you it is
[1:02:42] for flesh and blood has not revealed
[1:02:45] in other words
[1:02:51] my son cannot inherit my Revelations
[1:02:54] God has to give it to him
[1:03:02] when Isaac had Jacob and Esau
[1:03:07] they could not inherit the Revelation
[1:03:11] it was God who chose
[1:03:14] before they were in their mother's womb
[1:03:17] that's what the Bible says
[1:03:24] before they were in their mother's womb
[1:03:28] it doesn't matter if their father was
[1:03:30] Isis
[1:03:31] and their grandfather was Abraham
[1:03:38] has nothing to do with it
[1:03:44] their little grandfather was Abraham
[1:03:47] said
[1:03:48] Abraham had an encounter with God
[1:03:51] and with the angels
[1:03:56] being the grandsons of Abraham
[1:04:00] Revelation they could not inherit the
[1:04:03] Revelation that Abraham received
[1:04:06] because it's not by flesh or blood
[1:04:09] it's not him that runneth okay or him
[1:04:14] but to whom God showeth Mercy
[1:04:19] foreign
[1:04:46] they could not inherit Samuel's
[1:04:49] revelation
[1:05:09] that person goes to the hospital and
[1:05:11] they get operated
[1:05:13] and they take they snatch away the
[1:05:16] cancer
[1:05:18] some some way or another they remove
[1:05:20] that demon is
[1:05:24] when that person comes out of the
[1:05:26] hospital bed of the operating room
[1:05:29] they're still the same person
[1:05:32] they still have the same habits
[1:05:35] they still have the same struggles
[1:05:39] or mannerism why is that so
[1:05:43] they've removed the cancer they removed
[1:05:45] that demon
[1:06:33] so that person can be totally set free
[1:06:47] he will only appear to those who are
[1:06:50] looking for him are you looking for him
[1:06:53] we gotta we gotta wait upon him
[1:06:57] no other esses
[1:07:00] that's the reason John saw the light
[1:07:07] and he's the only one that saw it Juan
[1:07:10] yo testimonial John bear record saying
[1:07:16] nobody else
[1:07:19] when Paul saw that same light struck him
[1:07:23] down
[1:07:34] so when Paul had that warrant on his way
[1:07:37] to Damascus
[1:07:39] he was on his way
[1:07:41] he wasn't alone
[1:07:44] but when that light came
[1:07:47] when Jesus Christ appeared to Paul
[1:07:50] the Bible in acts as different it says
[1:07:54] three different things
[1:07:58] they said that they saw the light but
[1:08:00] they couldn't hear the voice it says
[1:08:05] you can look for it and search it out
[1:08:08] but here the prophet is telling us
[1:08:17] the men that were surrounding Paul okay
[1:08:24] unable to see or hear the thing that
[1:08:26] were coming out of that light amen
[1:08:28] Brothers
[1:08:30] it's the same thing this morning
[1:08:35] God's word is being voiced
[1:08:38] the light is showing itself
[1:08:43] but the Lord is revealing himself to
[1:08:45] them
[1:08:47] to those that are looking for him
[1:08:50] they want more Revelation
[1:08:54] they understand
[1:08:57] that it's not just a simple Sunday it's
[1:09:00] a Sunday
[1:09:02] that maybe it could be my last Sunday
[1:09:07] anyone I want to grab onto that
[1:09:09] Revelation from God I want to be a
[1:09:11] better Christian
[1:09:13] I want to stop doing these things
[1:09:17] I want God to reveal to me
[1:09:19] the light is already here
[1:09:22] but we have to
[1:09:37] because it was not for them
[1:09:39] it was for Paul
[1:09:53] that's the only way
[1:09:56] that God reveals himself
[1:09:59] that he's always done it that way
[1:10:05] and always will
[1:10:11] so we see that after Paul encountered
[1:10:14] that light
[1:10:16] there wasn't a change in Paul yes
[1:10:21] his name was no longer saw but it was
[1:10:23] changed
[1:10:27] when you encounter that lie with the
[1:10:29] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:31] your name will not be changed
[1:10:34] laughs
[1:10:38] okay okay
[1:10:40] what what is what does it do mean
[1:10:44] the Lord changes my name from Luis
[1:10:48] Jose Luis to Jose Luis right when I came
[1:10:52] to Florida just an example or Stephen
[1:10:57] I'll still be the same person
[1:11:02] what's the point of changing my name
[1:11:04] from Luis to uh to Brian abroad I'm
[1:11:08] Brian
[1:11:11] what's the point
[1:11:16] but what we want is a change of nature
[1:11:20] he changed Abram to
[1:11:24] abrahamas
[1:11:28] it's a changing of a different nature
[1:11:31] yes Revelation and it's revelation
[1:11:40] so we began to notice that when we begin
[1:11:42] to walk in this Christian walk
[1:11:47] a person that just was newly converted
[1:11:50] to Christ
[1:11:51] we see that that person struggles
[1:11:56] is different than in comparison to a
[1:11:59] person that's been in the way for 30
[1:12:01] years
[1:12:04] that person that just came to Christ
[1:12:07] what do they struggle with fiestas they
[1:12:12] struggle with friends parties and social
[1:12:15] media Costas
[1:12:19] the things that to them that are already
[1:12:22] in the message
[1:12:23] it's a
[1:12:25] that's baby stuff right
[1:12:31] so when that person begins to grow
[1:12:35] and they begin to walk in the Christian
[1:12:37] path
[1:12:39] the struggles in a certain way
[1:12:43] they become a bit lighter
[1:12:46] because in a certain way
[1:12:49] you now have Revelations
[1:12:52] on what to do and what not to do
[1:12:58] to look for and to who is
[1:13:03] and I hope you're understanding what I'm
[1:13:05] saying
[1:13:10] and you say well I don't have time
[1:13:14] if I go to a party of a family member
[1:13:17] that's not a Christian
[1:13:20] I know that I'm gonna eat I'm gonna be
[1:13:22] with him
[1:13:23] but when the party the dancing starts
[1:13:26] yeah
[1:13:49] you no longer start to struggle with
[1:13:51] those things
[1:13:53] you begin to now a battle against
[1:13:56] Spirits enticing spirits
[1:14:11] now you're dealing with fears that seem
[1:14:14] similar
[1:14:17] entonces
[1:14:18] so then they get even harder
[1:14:23] because now you have to meditate you
[1:14:27] have to wait
[1:14:28] you have to pray
[1:14:30] you
[1:14:34] can't just run and hopefully
[1:14:38] because those are now enticing Spirits
[1:14:42] that's why we find Brothers on the
[1:14:44] Wayside
[1:14:45] brothers that are getting cold
[1:14:50] because they thought it was God's word
[1:14:55] but in reality it was an enticing spirit
[1:15:00] a
[1:15:02] I'm an user one you love the Lord
[1:15:04] Brothers
[1:15:08] the Bible tells us
[1:15:13] those Spirits were deceived very elected
[1:15:16] if it was possible
[1:15:19] trying to get them out of God's word
[1:15:23] trying to get us out of the will of
[1:15:25] course
[1:15:28] because when you're LED of God's spirit
[1:15:32] where will God's spirit lead us to
[1:15:35] the word
[1:15:42] it won't just merely take you to the
[1:15:45] word
[1:15:48] it's not only just going to take you to
[1:15:51] the Bible
[1:15:52] but what it will do it will reveal it to
[1:15:55] you
[1:16:22] rejects the guidance of God's holy
[1:16:25] spirit
[1:16:27] he says the Holy Spirit lives
[1:16:31] and then an enticing Wicked Spirit comes
[1:16:35] and starts leading you
[1:16:38] foreign
[1:17:50] and you apply to God's foreign
[1:18:11] to that Revelation amen
[1:18:15] ah
[1:18:25] he says and you know there are some of
[1:18:28] the stuff that look and looks so
[1:18:30] absolutely true
[1:18:32] and yet
[1:18:34] isn't true
[1:18:37] he says see it looks like it is but it
[1:18:40] isn't it
[1:18:42] so what must we do okay
[1:18:48] what is the counselor what is it that uh
[1:18:51] the prophet says
[1:18:53] the prophet says in the message
[1:18:55] conferences
[1:19:04] for the orders and then they move
[1:19:08] I'll say it again
[1:19:57] [Music]
[1:20:03] of what you read
[1:20:06] foreign
[1:21:06] good to come to church and receive from
[1:21:08] God
[1:21:13] and then when the morning comes and you
[1:21:15] don't want to get up
[1:21:18] but then Revelation starts
[1:21:21] and you say no I have a revelation
[1:21:24] I go to church
[1:21:26] to hear God's word
[1:21:30] the Gates of Hell will not win over you
[1:21:33] it doesn't matter what comes you come
[1:21:37] anyway
[1:21:38] even the car is breaking down
[1:21:41] because it's a revelation
[1:21:45] my car isn't working
[1:21:49] please give me a ride
[1:21:52] I have to go
[1:21:54] it's a revelation
[1:21:58] because the Gates of Hell will not
[1:22:00] Prevail over me
[1:22:02] doesn't matter what happens
[1:22:04] it's a revelation
[1:22:09] the demo with those little tiny things
[1:22:11] is trying
[1:22:14] for you not to come
[1:22:17] when you
[1:22:48] it's revelation
[1:22:52] aura
[1:22:55] El perfecta now the prophet tells us
[1:22:59] that we must uh
[1:23:03] pray and wait upon God's orders
[1:23:07] because those two Spirits are very
[1:23:10] similar like like now the pillar of fire
[1:23:13] of the Holy Ghost that's leading us
[1:23:18] will take us to trials
[1:23:22] it will take us to the furnace
[1:23:25] it will take us to the lines
[1:23:29] to see what you will do foreign
[1:24:48] of God
[1:24:55] you
[1:24:57] truly love the Lord amen
[1:25:04] I want you to watch something
[1:25:08] is just
[1:25:10] how many of you can say amen God is just
[1:25:14] he's Fair
[1:25:17] he says do you believe that audience
[1:25:21] absolutely
[1:25:23] he's absolutely just
[1:25:28] and if God only requires one religion
[1:25:35] was just as just as able was
[1:25:40] Bueno
[1:25:44] this is
[1:25:48] just as just as Abel was
[1:25:53] Muchachos both those boys
[1:25:57] come before God
[1:26:00] Kane
[1:26:02] wasn't a communist
[1:26:05] he wasn't an
[1:26:07] infidelo an
[1:26:09] unbelievera he was UN
[1:26:13] a believer
[1:26:20] have you fastened your seatbelts on
[1:26:23] it
[1:26:26] the brother Adam says that in every
[1:26:28] Church there's three kinds of beliefs
[1:26:30] now what are they
[1:26:34] in
[1:26:37] unbeliever
[1:26:39] make believer
[1:26:42] and the believer there's three kinds
[1:26:46] the unbeliever
[1:26:49] he doesn't even believe he doesn't do
[1:26:52] anything the make-believer he's here and
[1:26:57] then he's out
[1:27:01] but the believer
[1:27:04] there's two
[1:27:07] that's what the prophet says you have
[1:27:10] the weeds and you have the tears
[1:27:41] that the wheat and The Tear
[1:27:44] they seem very similar
[1:27:51] my brains my brains blow out
[1:27:56] because the weeds has the grain the
[1:28:01] tears
[1:28:02] it looks very nice
[1:28:06] but when you open it
[1:28:08] it has nothing inside
[1:28:16] the unbeliever
[1:28:19] I'm not worried about him
[1:28:22] the make-believer I'm not worried about
[1:28:24] him
[1:28:26] but the believer
[1:28:31] is where we have to be careful
[1:28:36] he wasn't like the Russians he wasn't an
[1:28:39] infidelity
[1:28:43] he was not an unbelievable
[1:28:46] he was a Believer
[1:28:51] and if God only requires a believer
[1:28:57] he would be unjust to condemn Cain
[1:29:05] and if God only requires a Believer
[1:29:09] then God Is
[1:29:14] So then there's something else then just
[1:29:17] believing
[1:29:21] you love the Lord
[1:29:27] he says now this is going to make you
[1:29:30] tighten up your ecclesiastical vest just
[1:29:32] a little bit
[1:29:33] if you say
[1:29:36] I'm a Believer
[1:29:38] so was Cain
[1:29:54] he's the first one that comes to church
[1:30:04] I believe the words
[1:30:12] but he built a church
[1:30:16] very beautiful
[1:30:22] the Book of James says
[1:30:26] the Devils also believe in tremble
[1:30:31] and those is
[1:30:33] not just enough to just come to church
[1:30:37] we got to go a bit higher
[1:30:44] it's not only coming to church now come
[1:30:48] up hither
[1:31:01] did cane
[1:31:31] I worship the Lord From the Bottom of My
[1:31:34] Heart
[1:31:36] so did Cain
[1:31:38] e
[1:31:39] Kane was a Believer a worshiper
[1:31:45] and just as fundamentally right amen
[1:31:50] and brother Adam says amen
[1:31:52] oh I love this
[1:31:55] I pray God steam our hearts
[1:32:00] President says
[1:32:04] [Music]
[1:32:09] they were fundamentally and scripturally
[1:32:11] right
[1:32:13] so where does this different lie
[1:32:25] he says one of you is a devil
[1:32:29] maybe I would think
[1:32:32] that Peter was that devil
[1:32:36] because Peter was always messing up
[1:32:39] and he was always screwing up
[1:32:42] the mistakes
[1:32:48] Jesus one time when he said to Peter
[1:32:50] depart from me
[1:32:52] the one that disciples
[1:32:57] Peter was that devil and Judas
[1:33:01] maybe it didn't uh it didn't even cross
[1:33:04] their minds because Judas
[1:33:07] would also pray for this
[1:33:09] but also cast out demons
[1:33:12] he would also preach like Jesus did
[1:33:16] but Peter had mistakes
[1:33:31] [Music]
[1:33:33] the Bible says that the the tares will
[1:33:36] be bundled up first of all
[1:33:40] then when the weed is taken out Anton
[1:33:43] says yeah
[1:33:51] very similar to each other
[1:33:56] maybe it never crossed their minds that
[1:33:58] it was actually Judas
[1:34:01] I don't know
[1:34:03] how old Judas was
[1:34:07] President says they were very alike
[1:34:10] cuando Jesus
[1:34:12] when Jesus was nailed the prophet says
[1:34:16] there was not three crosses
[1:34:19] what there were four crosses
[1:34:23] who was the fourth one is
[1:34:28] that in the Bible it said it was Judas
[1:34:33] Judas hung himself on a tree it was four
[1:34:37] okay
[1:34:39] Jesus and Judas is
[1:34:43] those two Spirits have been from Genesis
[1:34:45] up until now
[1:34:47] they're so similar to each other
[1:35:48] both believe God's word
[1:35:51] both were faithful members
[1:35:55] but when the time came to serve God
[1:35:58] when the worshiper God came okay what
[1:36:02] happened then
[1:36:22] he brought everything just as religious
[1:36:24] as able
[1:36:27] but look here's a little something I
[1:36:29] think I made it
[1:36:31] so look in the days of Cain and Abel
[1:36:36] notice Cain was just as religious as
[1:36:39] Abel was
[1:36:41] when he worshiped
[1:36:44] he builds his altars
[1:36:50] he made it pretty just like a fine big
[1:36:53] church
[1:36:55] he wasn't an unbeliever
[1:36:59] he bowed down in worshiped
[1:37:03] and God absolutely refused him
[1:37:06] foreign
[1:38:08] he made a sacrifice and done obligations
[1:38:11] that Worship the Lord
[1:38:15] that's a pretty good church member today
[1:38:19] and God refused them
[1:38:22] but look here coming here at Abel coming
[1:38:26] here
[1:38:28] not with working
[1:38:30] he didn't come with words
[1:38:35] that faith our works expressed
[1:38:39] but able to understand
[1:38:42] that we're not saved by words
[1:38:45] but if you have Revelations
[1:38:48] then that will produce words
[1:38:52] but the Revelation is behind those works
[1:38:55] the prophet says
[1:39:00] he says he tied the little sheep around
[1:39:02] the neck
[1:39:03] a little Grapevine yeah
[1:39:18] [Music]
[1:39:25] foreign he began to be his throw yes
[1:39:31] it's because Abel had a revelation the
[1:39:35] brother Adam says
[1:39:38] he says we're letting that soak just a
[1:39:40] minute
[1:39:42] it was a revelation
[1:39:47] what was the difference between Cain and
[1:39:49] Abel the revelation
[1:40:47] it begins
[1:41:08] the blood was covering April
[1:41:12] and then that's when God came down and
[1:41:16] God refused them and came was Wrath
[1:42:19] read the messages
[1:42:22] but only God's children
[1:42:25] are led by the spirit of God yes and
[1:42:29] it's by revelation
[1:42:32] he had a revelation
[1:42:35] yes and that's what pleased God please
[1:42:38] stand
[1:42:39] if the musicians
[1:42:42] the prophet says
[1:42:45] and the message is the Masterpiece
[1:42:50] he says that when he saw that vision
[1:42:54] and he saw the different churches
[1:42:56] passing
[1:42:59] and then he says when it came to the
[1:43:01] last one
[1:43:02] that's what he says to the last one
[1:43:06] he says then I turn to the right
[1:43:11] and he showed me every Church
[1:43:14] of the times of centuries the ages
[1:43:18] and the last one
[1:43:21] was this last Church age of these last
[1:43:24] days
[1:43:28] [Music]
[1:43:40] they were being led
[1:43:44] foreign
[1:43:45] by who
[1:43:48] brother random says
[1:43:50] by a witch
[1:43:54] is
[1:43:56] in a gray clothing just a paper not even
[1:44:01] clothing
[1:44:02] just some kind of paper Greece that was
[1:44:05] great
[1:44:06] which gray means deceiving
[1:44:09] and then the prophet says
[1:44:12] next and he and he heard enciente here
[1:44:16] comes the American group aquiven el
[1:44:18] Grupo Americano
[1:44:19] and when they were coming out
[1:44:23] the leader or their guide was a witch
[1:44:28] with a very long nose nose and a big
[1:44:32] mouth
[1:44:32] [Music]
[1:44:38] is the worldwide Council of churches
[1:44:42] because those two Spirits are so similar
[1:44:46] we're reaching
[1:44:49] at the end time
[1:44:52] we don't even know what is what anymore
[1:44:56] we're just waiting for the coming of the
[1:44:58] Lord
[1:44:59] but we have to go to the words go to the
[1:45:03] message
