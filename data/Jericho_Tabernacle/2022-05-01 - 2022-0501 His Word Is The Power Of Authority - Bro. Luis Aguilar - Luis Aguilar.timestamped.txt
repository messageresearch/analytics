[47:14] matthew 8 verse 5.

[49:35] lord
[49:36] telling you lord opening our hearts to
[49:38] you
[49:42] really and truly no words to say to your
[49:44] people
[49:49] father but may you fill in the blanks
[49:51] lord but
[49:54] lord may you give the words this morning
[50:10] lord may you help your people or to
[50:12] recognize and hear the word
[50:16] this is a very special time
[50:20] a special part of the service is to hear
[50:22] your words
[50:25] [Music]
[50:26] lord may you anoint every single one of
[50:28] us
[50:31] we ask this in the name of jesus christ
[50:35] amen amen you may take your seats
[50:38] once again we thank you all for for
[50:40] being here this morning
[50:45] and uh
[50:46] we're thankful for the lord for the life
[50:48] that he has allowed us to have
[51:21] which you say speak the word
[51:26] when you tell people just speak the word
[51:30] but we want to do we want to dissect
[51:32] that word
[51:45] what backs up the phrase speak the word
[51:58] maybe not of knowledge of words and and
[52:01] [Music]
[52:02] intellectual
[52:18] when brother branham you know he saw he
[52:20] went to these real big meetings
[52:24] uh i i forgive me i might not quote it
[52:27] correctly
[52:29] you saw the minister's group coming in
[52:35] his group will follow after the minister
[52:40] very fine
[52:41] educated people
[52:45] and here comes the other preacher with
[52:46] his people
[52:49] very rich and educated fine people okay
[52:55] and then brother brown saw the people
[52:56] that were that were sick illogic
[53:25] and that's what we're wanting is the
[53:27] lord to reveal us his word
[53:32] amen amen so here we find this man as a
[53:36] roman centurion
[53:40] romano knowing that the the romans
[53:41] didn't crucify jesus christ
[53:46] levites didn't crucify jesus christ
[53:50] the jews did not crucify jesus christ
[54:07] so this this this man is roman soldier
[54:12] approach the lord jesus christ
[54:16] amen so let's go to mark 1 21.
[54:21] here jesus is in the same city of
[54:23] capernaum
[54:27] and they went into capernaum on mark 1
[54:29] 21 in marcos
[54:31] and they went into capernaum and
[54:33] straightway on the sabbath day he
[54:35] entered
[54:36] into the synagogue and taught
[54:39] in capernaum
[54:44] amen i like how the bibles are flipping
[54:49] you know we don't have any more bibles
[54:50] now today yeah
[54:52] you know i must be blessed you just have
[54:54] ipads and tablets
[54:56] ipads
[54:57] but it's nice to hear that in the church
[55:01] amen verse 22.
[55:04] and
[55:05] [Music]
[55:38] how do you teach just by going to
[55:40] chalkboard and you start teaching
[55:41] someone
[55:46] the best teaching
[56:13] a message
[56:39] if i speak about a minister as a public
[56:42] servant
[56:45] but when i come down
[56:48] i don't want to pick up a chair
[56:50] i don't want to pick up a trash
[56:53] because i'm a minister
[56:55] but this is right here with what the
[56:57] lord jesus christ was teaching his
[56:59] disciples
[57:04] he was not only just preaching to them
[57:07] but he was showing him them
[57:25] a man with the unclean spirit and he
[57:27] cried out
[57:32] saying let us alone
[57:35] what do we have to do with thee
[57:38] uh
[57:53] and jesus rebuked him saying hold thy
[57:55] peace and come out of him
[58:00] now who was jesus speaking to our akin
[58:03] jesus
[58:04] speaking to the man
[58:13] brother brown gave us one one good
[58:15] golden nugget
[58:19] he says
[58:20] love the sinner sinners
[58:25] sometimes we get that mixed up yeah this
[58:27] is uh
[58:28] we hate the sinner okay
[58:34] it wasn't the man
[58:36] he was talking to the spirit
[58:39] and jesus rebuked them
[58:42] 26 and when the unclean spirit had torn
[58:44] him and cried out with the loud voice he
[58:46] came out of him
[59:02] but when you speak god's word
[59:06] you don't have to repeat it to the demon
[59:08] twice or three times
[59:13] once is enough
[59:16] when you tell them
[59:31] get out of there get out get it come out
[59:32] get out of there again
[59:37] one time
[59:38] once is enough
[59:40] when brother brandon will come in the
[59:42] prayer line
[59:43] brown condor
[1:00:10] you hardly really will shout in the
[1:00:13] prayer line
[1:00:17] because he knew who he was
[1:00:20] when sometimes when when when you scream
[1:00:23] and you shout it out sometimes you're
[1:00:24] insecure
[1:00:26] lost
[1:00:30] and when they were all amazed and so
[1:00:32] much that they questioned amongst
[1:00:34] themselves saying
[1:00:38] what thing is this what new doctrine is
[1:00:41] this quest
[1:00:44] for with authority commanded he even the
[1:00:47] unclean spirits and they do obey him
[1:00:54] amen amen let's read what the brother
[1:00:56] bram says
[1:00:58] now see the roman recognized that jesus
[1:01:01] of nazareth had the authority over
[1:01:04] sickness
[1:01:37] [Music]
[1:01:46] all right he knew that jesus had that
[1:01:48] much authority and more over sickness
[1:02:04] but i know what authority is but yo
[1:02:08] you just speak the word
[1:02:11] my servant will live
[1:02:14] speak the word
[1:02:17] here's a very key thing here what
[1:02:18] brother branham says
[1:02:22] the roman soldier
[1:02:25] i know what authority is
[1:02:30] what is the word no comes from the word
[1:02:32] knowledge
[1:02:35] knowledge is facts
[1:02:38] information uh information skills
[1:02:41] acquired by a person through experience
[1:02:43] abilities
[1:03:14] and if i tell someone under me go and he
[1:03:16] has to go
[1:03:17] in
[1:03:19] again this is how authority works
[1:03:24] i hope you're following me
[1:03:27] he was under authority
[1:03:42] your dad taught you or your excuse me
[1:03:44] because your dad or your mom
[1:03:47] no it has to be something personal
[1:03:50] one-on-one
[1:03:53] this man was under authority
[1:04:24] he
[1:04:38] do
[1:04:41] he was uh he probably started his ranks
[1:04:46] started cleaning the restrooms he says
[1:04:48] so forth
[1:04:50] picking up the trash
[1:04:53] started to yeah
[1:04:54] how to be under authority
[1:04:59] and matthew matthew this is on matthew 8
[1:05:01] but in matthew 9
[1:05:05] jesus was going to go heading to heal
[1:05:08] jairus daughter uh jesus
[1:05:12] jairus came on to him and said lord my
[1:05:14] my my daughter she's she's dead uh
[1:05:17] she's sick um
[1:05:27] i need you to come and lay hands on my
[1:05:29] daughter
[1:05:32] and as jesus was heading towards towards
[1:05:34] that house jesus
[1:05:38] there was that woman who had the blood
[1:05:39] issue
[1:05:42] who struggled with for 12 years
[1:05:46] so jesus was heading to heal
[1:05:48] jairus's daughter jesus
[1:05:52] but along the way there was another
[1:05:54] woman who had another issue
[1:05:59] and her revelation
[1:06:01] so i don't need to touch him

[1:07:50] no i don't have i don't think i have
[1:07:52] that quote up there but i would just
[1:07:53] just notice what i'm about to say here
[1:08:09] el fuego power
[1:08:12] and authority

[1:08:18] both both of their faith was in christ
[1:08:36] i have this quote up here in the slides

[1:08:39] um
[1:08:41] you know jairus said come and lay hands
[1:08:43] on my little girl
[1:08:47] and she will live
[1:08:48] the roman said i'm not worthy that you
[1:08:50] come under my roof
[1:08:54] why why did the romans say that porque
[1:08:56] es que el romano di hueson this is a
[1:08:57] gentile porque elera gentile we were not
[1:09:00] we were not we had no part of this
[1:09:33] because he's under me
[1:09:35] and i say to this one you do so
[1:09:39] and he does it
[1:09:41] because he has to obey me he's under me
[1:09:45] what was the roman doing
[1:09:49] what was the roman doing
[1:09:52] he was recognizing the supreme deity of
[1:09:55] jesus christ
[1:09:59] what a revelation by a question
[1:10:15] they had a whole loaf of bread and they
[1:10:16] rejected the bread
[1:10:20] but when us the gentiles we were
[1:10:22] satisfied with just the crumbs
[1:10:27] and this roman
[1:10:28] soldier was recognizing the supreme
[1:10:31] deity of jesus christ
[1:10:35] wow what that that's awesome right there
[1:10:38] now there's a lot of golden nuggets i
[1:10:40] just hope you you get them
[1:11:00] well i don't need you to come to my
[1:11:02] house
[1:11:04] because i'm not worthy for you to come
[1:11:06] enter my house
[1:11:08] i don't have i'm not worthy i
[1:11:10] have
[1:11:24] you
[1:11:53] the gentiles were not worthy of him
[1:11:58] the jews were his chosen people
[1:12:02] so see
[1:12:03] who gives revelation and
[1:12:05] revelation do i just
[1:12:09] open it up and i just grab it
[1:12:12] no god gives a revelation
[1:12:17] oh man i hope i hope you i really hope
[1:12:20] you really get it
[1:12:23] now
[1:12:24] if i if i'm outside
[1:12:27] and sometimes i see trash on the floor
[1:12:29] yeah this is your will
[1:12:31] one walks by it you know
[1:12:34] one
[1:12:39] what revelations are we asking the lord
[1:12:41] to give us
[1:12:44] a lord show me the mysteries of the
[1:12:46] seven seals
[1:12:48] mysterious
[1:13:02] is
[1:13:24] what shall we say then
[1:13:26] is there unrighteousness with god
[1:13:30] justice
[1:13:46] god just doesn't care about me
[1:13:48] whatsoever it's not important
[1:13:51] he gives you the cross that you can
[1:13:53] carry
[1:13:56] 15.
[1:13:57] for he saith to moses i will have mercy
[1:14:00] on whom i will have mercy
[1:14:06] and i will have compassion on who i will
[1:14:08] have compassion
[1:14:13] so then it is not him that willeth
[1:14:18] nor of him that runeth
[1:14:22] but of god that show with mercy
[1:14:27] i really really wanted to i really want
[1:14:29] to learn
[1:14:31] to run as hard as i can
[1:14:35] you don't work for this
[1:14:38] you don't work for it
[1:14:40] it's god
[1:14:54] have i
[1:15:04] it wasn't the other pharaoh who raised
[1:15:06] pharaoh
[1:15:50] that
[1:16:02] knows about egypt and with moses and
[1:16:04] pharaoh
[1:16:10] therefore he has mercy on him who will
[1:16:12] have mercy entonces
[1:16:16] and whom he will harden us
[1:16:33] piece of cake uh banco meal you could
[1:16:35] have made moses ferro el podo a certain
[1:16:39] pharaoh said all right here we go
[1:16:43] but god has a certain way
[1:16:46] protest he would have made it that easy
[1:16:51] no one would have known the power that
[1:16:53] god has
[1:16:55] done
[1:16:56] that's why there's a sick person
[1:17:00] so there can be
[1:18:01] he was recognizing the supreme deity of
[1:18:03] jesus christ
[1:18:06] and these jews didn't know who he was
[1:18:08] yes
[1:18:10] i thought he
[1:18:33] this is the supreme deity of jesus
[1:18:36] christ
[1:18:52] it is a supreme deity
[1:18:54] of jesus christ
[1:18:57] you must know who he is
[1:19:01] when you hear the voice
[1:19:05] ain't that good
[1:19:06] how
[1:19:18] you must know who he is
[1:19:34] i still have a texas area code
[1:19:37] area
[1:19:38] i don't have 602048
[1:19:42] and i call the brother or so forth
[1:19:50] oh brother forgive me i didn't know it
[1:19:52] was you brother luis
[1:19:53] it was a texas area code
[1:19:58] but if you if you saw the error code 600
[1:20:00] somebody from somebody here from
[1:20:14] you know he's the only one here with a
[1:20:16] 936 area
[1:20:20] so here is the same thing with jesus
[1:20:21] christ
[1:20:24] do we have to have that revelation of
[1:20:26] the deity of jesus christ
[1:20:43] the beginning and the
[1:20:51] [Music]
[1:21:11] he wasn't just a man
[1:21:24] he was receiving that revelation
[1:21:34] amen i hope you're writing this down
[1:21:35] because we're going to talk about that
[1:21:36] just a bit especially
[1:21:40] now just a little comment before we read
[1:21:42] again
[1:21:46] this morning we take in the supreme
[1:21:48] deity of the revelation of jesus christ
[1:21:54] who god revealed him revealed him to us
[1:22:00] this morning as a supreme deity
[1:22:04] the great i am the grand joe
[1:22:06] nor not i was or will be
[1:22:22] jesus christ
[1:22:24] what's the first thing he reveals
[1:22:26] himself here as well
[1:22:30] the god of heaven
[1:22:32] not a triune god
[1:22:34] but one god
[1:22:38] [Applause]
[1:22:40] and he reveals himself that way in the
[1:22:42] first of revelations
[1:22:47] and he speaks it four times in the first
[1:22:49] chapter
[1:24:14] before the
[1:24:30] so the first revelation we shouldn't be
[1:24:31] looking for some great mysteries
[1:24:37] he goes in faith and faith
[1:24:40] glory and glory gloria and gloria you
[1:24:42] get
[1:24:57] that sounds just like him
[1:24:59] when you recognize the scriptures
[1:25:02] and he reveals himself to you
[1:25:05] he takes the blind off your eyes
[1:25:08] he takes the earplugs out of your ears
[1:25:25] solomon
[1:25:26] through the edges
[1:25:30] when you know who he is
[1:25:33] you know his voice
[1:25:35] and when another uncertain sound comes
[1:25:52] i have
[1:26:04] the contact might not be there
[1:26:18] christ will never contradict his word
[1:26:35] uh i hope i hope the lord is revealing
[1:26:36] you the scriptures
[1:26:45] revelations 1 1 apocalypse
[1:26:48] he says what is the what is the
[1:26:50] revelation of
[1:26:52] the revelation of jesus christ
[1:26:54] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[1:26:56] gave on to him
[1:27:00] so god gave it to him
[1:27:30] you can grab it you can throw it away
[1:27:31] you could do whatever you want with it
[1:27:34] the revelation that i should be seeking
[1:27:39] of course is the word
[1:27:42] the supreme deity of jesus christ
[1:27:58] then you start adding to your
[1:28:00] revelations
[1:28:03] what revelation should i be seeking
[1:28:08] you know what revelation
[1:28:12] god forgave me i'm a little mischievous
[1:28:16] but i say with a true honest heart
[1:28:20] the revelation
[1:28:22] of loving the amar my wife amie
[1:28:54] do you know your wife's favorite
[1:28:56] restaurant
[1:28:58] restaurant
[1:29:01] one one brother

[1:29:15] revelation of what their favorite food
[1:29:17] are casual
[1:29:21] see he taught them remember jesus christ
[1:29:24] taught the the disciples
[1:29:30] he didn't teach them
[1:29:33] you taught him how to have authority
[1:29:36] how can i
[1:30:19] the key to cast out a spirit this
[1:30:21] element
[1:30:22] is perfect love
[1:30:25] perfect it's perfect
[1:30:28] love cast out spirits
[1:30:32] when
[1:30:47] like i said you can grab it
[1:30:50] you can throw it away
[1:30:53] this is my revelation
[1:30:57] that's why brother abraham says i love
[1:30:58] that song that says down from his glory
[1:31:07] because i love it because it speaks
[1:31:09] about his deity
[1:31:13] he speaks about who he
[1:31:14] is it speaks about that he was a god
[1:31:17] coming to become man
[1:31:22] he wasn't just a prophet
[1:31:23] [Music]
[1:31:24] he was more than a man
[1:31:26] he was more than a prophet
[1:31:41] that you know that every other voice
[1:32:10] i'm the lord jesus christ el senor jesus
[1:32:11] christ bow down before me and worship me
[1:32:16] and you lord you know what john luther
[1:32:17] did yeah excuse me what uh uh john
[1:32:20] martin did
[1:32:22] uh juan martin
[1:32:24] you know what he did
[1:32:26] he says i rebuke you satan
[1:32:30] because you're not him
[1:32:32] because he's not crowned yet
[1:32:35] we're going to crown him
[1:32:50] you have to have that revelation of who
[1:32:52] he is
[1:32:55] because it says they would deceive the
[1:32:57] very elected if it was possible
[1:33:02] john martin said he says you're not even
[1:33:05] him
[1:33:19] when jesus heard it he marveled jesus
[1:33:23] he's talking about the roman centurion
[1:33:26] romano he said i have verily until you
[1:33:27] have not found so great faith not in
[1:33:29] israel
[1:33:33] and i say unto you that many shall come
[1:33:35] from the east and the west
[1:33:40] and shall sit down with abraham and
[1:33:41] isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven
[1:33:47] what is verse 11 speaking
[1:33:48] about el basicolons you speak about the
[1:33:50] gentiles habla de los gentiles and on
[1:33:52] verse 12.
[1:33:54] it is about the children of the kingdom
[1:33:56] [Music]
[1:33:58] shall be cast out into outer darkness
[1:34:02] there shall
[1:34:16] darkness
[1:34:21] they went through the time they went
[1:34:23] through a time
[1:34:25] of weeping and not we like wailing and
[1:34:27] gnashing of teeth
[1:34:30] they
[1:34:34] so you and i can have a space to repent
[1:34:41] but they were never cast out of the mind
[1:34:44] of god brother
[1:35:12] at the end time
[1:35:15] it's about the us the gentiles
[1:35:18] los gentiles they were blinded so we can
[1:35:20] have an opportunity
[1:35:24] to notice who joseph was
[1:35:38] next you know he became the right hand
[1:35:41] of pharaoh
[1:35:44] every knee was to bow down when joseph
[1:35:46] came in
[1:35:50] and joseph was the perfect type of jesus
[1:35:52] christ
[1:35:58] and when joseph was rejected by his
[1:36:00] brethren
[1:36:03] he was given a gentile wife
[1:36:09] that natural typifies the spirituals
[1:36:14] joseph was a type of christ
[1:36:17] he came for the jews
[1:36:20] the jews rejected him
[1:36:41] when jacob was blessing them
[1:36:44] remember jacob
[1:36:48] joseph had his children
[1:37:03] and it says jacob was blessing them
[1:37:07] ephraim was one onside on one side
[1:37:11] and manasseh on the other emanate
[1:37:13] he crossed his hands
[1:37:16] and he gave the younger child the
[1:37:18] blessing
[1:37:31] and jacob himself
[1:37:45] you put your right hand on the blessing
[1:37:47] on the young child
[1:37:51] it should have gone to the older one
[1:37:56] jacob said
[1:37:58] i know my hands are crossed your second
[1:38:00] is
[1:38:26] that's why he couldn't find a place to
[1:38:27] repent
[1:38:56] through the
[1:39:24] he
[1:40:11] a little after those quotes right there
[1:40:12] on paragraph 2
[1:40:14] 240.
[1:40:20] this is when jesus christ comes
[1:40:22] to christ he says arizona the desert
[1:40:25] arizona el decierto we will blossom
[1:40:28] the cactuses
[1:40:31] there's gonna be trees
[1:40:33] just read
[1:40:34] what the tape says
[1:40:37] but they're on the first hill
[1:40:40] says george joseph comes he says
[1:40:43] the desert is going to blossom
[1:40:47] hallelujah
[1:40:58] man see the jews had the right to become
[1:41:00] the bride
[1:41:26] because we recognize the supreme deity
[1:41:28] of jesus christ
[1:41:44] jesus christ
[1:41:59] they were all amazing so much at the
[1:42:01] question among themselves saying
[1:42:03] what thing is this
[1:42:05] what new doctrine is this for with
[1:42:07] authority command that he even the
[1:42:09] unclean spirits and they do obey him
[1:42:25] so when we tell the demon or an unkind
[1:42:28] spirit
[1:42:31] you have no authority
[1:42:35] i'm going to ask you two questions it's
[1:42:37] a rhetorical question
[1:42:40] so don't just think about it
[1:42:43] what gives the demon authority
[1:42:46] and when does that demon not have
[1:42:49] authority
[1:42:52] i'm going to pick your brain a little
[1:42:53] bit well yeah um
[1:43:06] how many are ready to receive the
[1:43:07] revelation of the lord
[1:43:22] how many know that the church
[1:43:25] is a hospital hospital it's people that
[1:43:27] are sick
[1:43:29] people that are hurt people that are
[1:43:30] damaged
[1:43:35] when a member makes a mistake
[1:43:49] have a hearing with one another
[1:43:53] that's what the scripture says
[1:43:56] yeah there it is
[1:43:58] if a member makes a mistake don't turn
[1:43:59] them down
[1:44:03] help him raise
[1:44:18] before we can go before god
[1:44:23] we got to go before that person we hurt
[1:44:28] what the prem says
[1:44:30] i
[1:44:31] had to do that yo
[1:45:01] i lied
[1:45:03] your mentee man
[1:45:05] i caused my wife to lie
[1:45:11] you can say amen to the word
[1:45:14] notice this is this is the prophet
[1:45:17] william branham william brown i had to
[1:45:19] do that i know i did wrong
[1:45:22] i lied this is your mentee and i caused
[1:45:25] my wife to lie
[1:45:29] i i believe i've told you about it here
[1:45:31] at the church
[1:45:33] it was a few days not long ago
[1:45:36] yes it's been about six weeks ago
[1:45:40] the attorneys had me so tore up
[1:45:46] over this investigation so i hardly knew
[1:45:48] where i was at
[1:45:50] investigation
[1:45:52] i had just got to go home from the
[1:45:55] office to eat dinner
[1:45:58] and then the private phone number rang
[1:46:00] and mera
[1:46:01] went to answer the phone
[1:46:04] number
[1:46:08] she put her hand over it
[1:46:10] and said
[1:46:20] my head feels like it's drawing off i'm
[1:46:21] losing my mind
[1:46:39] everyone has pressure
[1:46:42] but we have to let go of that pressure
[1:46:46] let it go let the pressure go
[1:46:49] i jumped up and i said tell them i'm not
[1:46:52] here
[1:47:01] she's very conscious of those things
[1:47:20] i know how
[1:47:33] i wasn't in here right then
[1:47:38] she said but you was here when he made
[1:47:40] the call
[1:47:43] that afternoon i went to pray for a sick
[1:47:45] baby
[1:47:48] and before i left the house the phone
[1:47:49] rang again
[1:47:55] and little joseph run over took the
[1:47:56] phone
[1:47:59] telephone said
[1:48:02] you want me to tell them you're not here
[1:48:08] you see how sin corrupts
[1:48:12] what a family would that finally be
[1:48:15] uh
[1:48:52] excuse me and little joseph run over
[1:48:54] took hold of the phone and said daddy
[1:48:57] jose
[1:48:58] tomorrow
[1:49:12] john the first chapter in the 21st verse
[1:49:21] then we have confidence in god
[1:49:24] for our hearts condemn us
[1:49:53] when i started to lay hands on it
[1:49:54] economy
[1:50:09] if brother branham wasn't fit to pray
[1:50:11] for that baby
[1:50:15] if he had to be clean
[1:50:18] i need to be clean
[1:50:21] when i lay my hands on someone who needs
[1:50:23] to be prayed for it
[1:50:26] i turn away from the man
[1:50:30] i said sir just wait here i got
[1:50:32] something something to make right
[1:50:40] i went up to the office and called him i
[1:50:41] said look sir i told the lion
[1:50:44] ladies
[1:50:46] i had my wife live
[1:50:50] i hope you get in the revelation of this
[1:50:52] of things
[1:50:54] she said i wasn't there
[1:50:58] and i ran out behind the house and i
[1:51:00] confessed it i told him about it
[1:51:10] he put his hands on my shoulder and he
[1:51:11] said brother branham el pose
[1:51:15] i've always have confidence in you
[1:51:18] but i got more than ever now
[1:51:21] a man
[1:51:22] he said that's willing to make his make
[1:51:25] right his wrongs
[1:51:30] a man that is willing to make right his
[1:51:32] wrongs
[1:51:35] i told them and i said i started to pray
[1:51:37] for a baby and the lord would just
[1:51:38] condemn me for it
[1:51:44] in my heart
[1:51:46] because i knew
[1:52:13] and if so then the spirit has all of the
[1:52:14] authority
[1:52:18] if not
[1:52:19] and the person has done all the
[1:52:21] requirements
[1:52:24] then that spirit has no authority
[1:52:28] is it the minister that's praying
[1:52:31] are we fit to pray for someone
[1:52:34] if our heart condemns us
[1:52:38] then we have confidence with god
[1:52:42] jesus said i taught them how to have
[1:52:44] authority jesus
[1:52:47] how to cast these unclean spirits out
[1:52:52] i'm done you can please stand yeah
[1:52:55] here there's roman soldier yeah
[1:52:58] that jesus christ had authority
[1:53:04] to cast out an evil spirit
[1:53:07] but here i find two powers
[1:53:10] one
[1:53:25] why does he stand by this element
[1:53:29] the reason in romans 8 17 18.
[1:53:38] there's a process the existing process
[1:53:40] faith and faith glory and glory of faith
[1:53:42] glory and glory to the child he was
[1:53:44] about to be adopted
[1:53:47] he had to be tutored
[1:53:50] he had had to get a report the two died
[1:53:53] report to the father
[1:53:56] he had to be interested in the father's
[1:53:58] business
[1:54:01] then he was heir to that throw to that
[1:54:04] business
[1:55:15] he said this is my beloved son
[1:55:19] here he him
[1:55:21] because whatever he says
[1:55:23] is as good as i say yes
[1:55:26] because i find them trustworthy
[1:55:28] i'm a clean man
[1:55:30] i find
[1:55:44] and if
[1:56:12] yeah
[1:56:14] faith and faith defense glory and glory
[1:56:18] and glory and glory
[1:56:20] man i i really hope you get it
[1:56:24] if so that we suffer with him
[1:56:32] i reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:56:34] present time are not worthy to be
[1:56:36] compared
[1:56:57] a lot of the evangelists they say well
[1:56:59] when he was crucified i was crucified
[1:57:04] crucified
[1:57:05] when he raised i was raised
[1:57:11] [Music]
[1:57:23] [Music]
[1:57:30] the reason for this is that character is
[1:57:32] simply never made without suffering la
[1:57:34] razon is
[1:57:50] because anybody can say do this do this
[1:57:51] do this do this do that
[1:57:56] character
[1:57:58] el character is a victory it's a
[1:58:00] victoria not a gift
[1:58:02] on a man without character
[1:58:11] [Music]
[1:58:44] everything is aligned today
[1:58:46] [Music]
[1:58:59] [Music]
[1:59:07] and the little temporary suffering that
[1:59:09] we go through now
[1:59:13] it's not worth it to be compared to the
[1:59:14] tremendous glory that would be revealed
[1:59:16] in us when he comes
[1:59:18] gloria
[1:59:21] oh what treasures are laid up for those
[1:59:25] questions
[1:59:26] who are willing to enter in his kingdom
[1:59:37] [Music]
[2:00:00] [Music]
[2:00:04] heavenly father we don't need you lord
[2:00:07] to come and lay hands on us lord
[2:00:16] that's why faith cometh by hearing and
[2:00:18] hearing of the word of god
[2:00:21] is there any sick amongst us
[2:00:51] in the name of jesus
