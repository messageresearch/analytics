cross where i first received my sight in la cruz that's what uh calvary does for us it gives us our sight it allows us to see what a beautiful thing god has given us amen so good to be here in the house of the lord once more to fellowship and to give god all the glory amen amen let us go straight to the scriptures if you would like to turn with me to saint john juan chapter 14. verses 16 all the way to verse 26. whenever you have it just go ahead and say it man and the bible says and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because he it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you spirit pero vosotros amen that's why i like that song at the cross in la cruz where i first received my site this comforter i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you get a little while and the world sees me no more but ye see me because i live ye shall live also now notice this at that day ye shall know that i am in the father and ye and me and i in your he that he that uh that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that love with me and he that loveth me shall be loved of the father and i will love him and i will manifest myself to him and he'll be loved by my father and i will love him and i will manifest myself to him now um here a disciple asked a very good question this judah saith unto him not iscariot lord how is it that thou will manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world then jesus tracks back and says exactly what he said in the beginning [Music] jesus said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him he that loveth me not keepeth not my saints the word which ye here is not mine but the father which sent me these things i have spoken unto you being present with you but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you el consolador el espiritu comes in the name of jesus christ so we don't have to separate the holy ghost from jesus that holy ghost that deals with you today heavenly father celestial lord we just want to give you the preeminence this evening father father lord that you may have the revelation in our lives father lord that you may give us the liberty to to serve you the way we want to father libertad lord i ask that you just take each and every person here lord persona lord each and every spirit under your control father spirit control lord that you may speak through i and the the interpreter lord that you may just give us what we need lord jesus we thank you we give you the glory in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and amen amen amen you may be seated my title this evening is the revelation for everyday life the revelation for everyday life you know um one of the hardest things i've seen in my christian life genuine people serve the lord one day they just go out into the world [Music] this is a message directed to the young people but i pray that god just puts it in each and every heart that receives it but but a young people uh we are raised in the message and as as we grow up as young people we we look like christians because that's what our household has us to do we're subject so the young sisters they they look like uh uh christians foreign of the world they walk according to the word of god and i've seen many young people yes where they begin to serve the lord because you go to church every every week because the way you dress doesn't make you a christian christian and telling somebody to act like [Music] [Music] a personal revelation in my my family my family my my my sister a person and she would tell me how much she loved the lord and every time something would happen she would she would be ready to pray for it but there was one day one day everything changed where she cut her hair off she put makeup on she started wearing pants because i said this great christian that i saw before my eyes what happened to her it was because she was never a christian cafe cristiano she was never converted she was doing it because she that's the way she was raised parents can raise their children as best as they can or close to the world but as soon as rock and roll music enters into the ears it'll catch that little spirit because we are bored with that nature porque nace con it's nobody's fault it's not that poor young person's fault it's their nature their nature to serve the things of the world amen amen i i had a really good friend of mine man we used to run around when uh when i was out in the world but then i gave my heart to the lord and i don't know how but i i ended up picking him up and taking them to my house and i we i gave him something to eat and then we begin to talk and i don't know how long or how many times he went to jail in my period of serving the lord no tiempo la carson but it allowed him to to read the bible okay i just got nervous because i didn't see the clock there my position and he told me that he read the whole bible and and his conclusion was conclusion fue that nobody could live up to the bible standards there is nobody that could live up to the bible standards he told me [Music] we could be as faithful as possible but yet our spirit is still held on to the things of the world brother branham says in impersonation of christianity personification christianity he said now he's he's talking about uh people that are struggling to serve or the lord yes impersonation of christianity i'll go over and join but i tell you and stick your head in yoke with christ and then you begin oh it chats my shoulders it hurts my social prestige the people i once associated with pass me by and say yeah there she is she's a holy roller last person there he goes see um he john don't come to the pool room anymore juan then the yolk is lined up with fat lined with feathers oh my haciendo no matter what the word calls you it don't make oh i backslid because i tell you i couldn't stand for them to call me this or that or the other no important you've never got the mainstream put mainspring put in the middle of um of this of his spirit in the middle of your spirit see you had a false impersonation you just you just accepted the emotional side and never got the real side us religion religion called formal religion religion free formal to follow the word it'll cage you up just like the world will cage you up this message i don't like anything bound down shackled down. put you in mind of cold formal religion that shackles you and binds you mentality but i don't like that um like that whosoever the son has made free is free indeed that's right just take your liberty gusta [Music] what a horrible feeling it is is the feeling of being trapped in religion i hate that it it just makes me crawl it makes my my my [Music] whenever my spirit didn't align with his spirit i would try everything i could to not be a christian christian whenever i was in in church economy and i was a completely different person because that's not what i wanted my spirit thirsted for the things of the world so so whenever uh we say not to do this and not to cut your hair and not to do this and we begin to create a very decent looking sinner therefore if the sun makes you freely it's the jesus says in john 8 32 jesus and ye shall know the truth you shall know the truth and when you know it it shall make you free well we've been raised in the message we've you know what the bible says you know what's right and what's wrong but do you know the truth but i can intellectually know the bible yo intellectual producer but if i don't know the truth i'm still caged up i'm still not free the devil knows the truth satan builds his church do you know what satan builds his church off of satan satan builds his church on the word of god when i heard that i was like ah that doesn't sound right but then he says but god builds his church upon the revelation of the words there's a big difference exists to know the truth and to really know the truth i can know the bible and i could be the worst sinner in the world my buddy me amigo i don't know where he's at my heart goes out to him because he's he did so much good things for me when we're out in the world i pray he's still alive i pray that god has mercy on him but he read the whole bible when he was in jail he probably knows the bible better than i do but he doesn't know the truth he doesn't know he does not have the revelation of the word the devil can go round and round around with the word with the bible of why not to do certain things we remember that scripture in matthew 16 15. when jesus begins to ask his disciples who [Music] [Music] some say you're this great prophet some say you're there some say or that but then he turned to peter and he says who do you say that i am and jesus says jesus blessed peter blessed thou art peter for flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto you flesh and blood has not revealed this to you you can hear the messages every sunday every uh wednesday and friday but it's not me who gives you the revelation it's not brother branham who gives you the revelation flesh and blood cannot give you revelation but it's from our father up in heaven not even jesus could give peter that revelation why jesus was flesh and blood he couldn't teach him a revelation when jesus began to say if you you uh do not eat in my flesh and drink of my blood you have no part with me jesus brother says people began to think he was a vampire man people thought that he was a crazy man they they didn't catch the revelation but peter pero pedro somebody of who jesus christ was is my father which is in heaven revealed the thing to you that he is the word of god it's a personal revelation it's something that brother branham says this is he says that if it would have been a revelation to the whole church when peter would have received that revelation juan pedro uh um that whole church would have been saved but that revelation was just for peter pedro now what is revelation revelation now i i know i'm speaking to people that know all right but i just want to speak to the young people what is revelation the greek word for revelation is apocalypse it's apocalypse that's that the world is terrified of that word it's just uh kind of funny yes i believe that the devil made it that way okay el diablo cause people to um be afraid of that word that the whole church is built upon revelations and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it revelation revelation the devil cannot prevail against revelation so the whole world is running away from apocalypse away from revelations but the bride lives off of revelation now the greek word for revelation is apocalypse and it means apocalypse it's like a a a sculpture has made a great statue and he's got it covered by a veil and then he goes and tears back this veil and reveals what's behind the veil it's an uncovering that's as simple as it is i sit in the u.s that's what revelation is is whenever you young sisters struggle to um wear decent clothing you young men struggle to act like a christian christian struggle to to uh not go with the trend of the world but i am paranoid it's hard it's defeating it's hard but and we have these questions why why do i have to be this way why do i have to act this way and maybe we don't ask anybody but it's a question on why can i just do this why where in the bible does it say i can't wear earrings where in the bible i can't do this or that and don't without revelation it'll never work without the understanding without jesus christ in your life it will never work i could try and try and try to be a christian christian and i know not to smoke and drink and do drugs but do i really have the revelation of why a christian acts the way he does when we talk of revelation people start gloria but where's the revelation on acting like a christian bro where's your revelation on everyday life uh how to overcome every single day that's where our revelation shall lie in contrast now i know time is slipping by jose so i'm just going to go over things real quick but the greatest revelation brother branham says this is the greatest revelation is the supreme deity of our lord jesus christ amen amen that's the greatest revelation brother berlin you can you've got to believe that in order to get to first base peter says in the message uh uh patma's vision that's what peter said repent and see the deity be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and ye and then you're ready to go in the spirit because we all know that scripture is when peter says repent um and be baptized with the uh in the name of the lord jesus christ and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost but brother branham inserts a quote here he said peter said to repent and then see the deity so when do you see the supreme deity of jesus christ when do you receive that great revelation when you receive your new birth brother branham says in in the uh christ is the mystery of god revealed el monobram lo this element what is the new birth then you see entonces it is the revelation of jesus christ personally to you so the whole church is built upon revelation jesus he is the mystery of all things jesus he is the mystery of everything every tree that you see that when you see the sky when you see nature when you look at time when you read from genesis to revelations is an apocalypse it should scream out jesus christ christ is the mystery of god revealed so whenever you receive christ in your heart you'll receive the word of god in your heart he is the fullness of the word pray to the lord or el senor to ask him for a revelation and he will give you that revelation amen amen the revelation is the new birth because it's the word becoming alive in you the revelation of jesus christ is the new birth birth is what becoming alive being born that's it's the word the letter is becoming alive in you so whenever the word is revealed in you it becomes alive in you cobra it becomes alive in me than me and then i i'm the walking word then nobody has to tell me not to do this and not to do that because it's alive in me he continues in the crisis the mystery of god revealed now all the quotes most of all my quotes is from that he was in the psalms he was in the history of the bible the prophetic um the bible is a prophetic book it's a historical book historical it's a book of love it's a book of songs it's a book of life and there you find christ that's amen amen then if he is that now listen to this song then if he's the principal theme of the bible [Music] amen he should be the principal theme of our life amen if he's the principal theme of the bible and the bible is in us then he should be the principal thing of every thing that we do say or think entonces of who jesus christ is personally to you then he'll be the principal theme of everything then the world will just push out of you then freedom in then the minister can say go out and drink tonight anymore then the devil can tempt you with everything everything that the devil can throw at you on on acting like the world a cerca de comportando acting like the you amen amen then it's freedom entonces that's the worst thing i i could put on anybody brother branham says a wishy washy christian is the most miserable person on earth he doesn't know if he's in the world or he doesn't know if he's with god he's double-minded mentally he's trying to juggle the world and god but whenever you give it all to the lord by your choice by you understanding why then it becomes something different now i realized this thing when brother branham was saying this that the daily life of the old testament saints santos testament in their daily lives dwelt the mysteries of god that's pretty amazing in their daily life in their daily walk in succumbing now it's hard to kind of understand this because all we see is the what's written of them but when moses when he saw that burning bush when moses had to walk to egypt when moses was rejected by the people every day he had a certain struggle um david whenever he was rejected by his own people maybe they didn't know or maybe they did but in that everyday life dwelt the mysteries of christ in that in abitaba los misterios whenever moses got angry and he smote the rock he was just angry not knowing that there was going to be a rock smitten on calvary his actions was the very mystery of christ whenever joseph was was there in prison not knowing that it was going to be christ that was going to be crucified for us since and that's why christ is in every christ was in their daily life now if he's the principal theme of their lives he has to be the principal theme of our lives then we in us in your decisions it's it's a prophecy it's a prophecy it's a reflection it's a reflex of jesus christ amen amen brother branham says look christ in you makes you the center of life of the revelation the center el centro it makes him the center of all revelation in you now i just got to say this again the word isn't rules the bible isn't rules it's a love story it's a book of psalms and look at what he says here what is it it's christ being revealed and he is the word and when the word is revealed it expresses itself so when you allow this word to be alive to be revealed in you in your daily walk whether it's a great big revelation or it's just a revelation to overcome that day revelation it expresses itself then it's not you trying to to fight against the current entonces but it's the word becoming alive and expressing itself through you expressed amen amen amen brother branham says do you see the man of branham if you say he's been revealed to me and then the life of christ produ um the life that christ produced here in the bible that the same life is is in him does not produce itself in [Music] then he continues in the message of the great commissioner a revelation of christ that brings the results what makes you act like a christian is the revelation of jesus christ i always thought i always thought it took a certain different revelation for everything i thought if you had to overcome smoking or drinking your pencils it's just a further revelation of who jesus christ is revelation when you understand how much jesus christ loves you if you understand how much jesus christ is interested in your everyday life when you understand that jesus christ is with you every step of the way when he's cheering you on though every step then listen so many people has got the wrong conception you say we make converts to christian christianity by his government that's not it well they're not supposed to drink buenos air tomato they're not supposed to lie do you know the mohammeds can outshine you respond you know the heathens in africa them black men they they've got laws among their tribes that outshine anything you can produce in christianity in africa we're not in the age of telling somebody not to do this because brother branham says that there's heathens that can outshine our lives that can live better and pure lives than a christian can live question christianity so i can reform or myself to become a christian you know god is making himself known not not we're supposed to make converts to christianity by a government case as god was in christ christ in you and what did god do in christ what did god did in christ oh wait when when what god did in christ god christ does in you what signs did god uh what what signs did god do in christ christ does in you oh isn't that beautiful oh my i like that i mean brother branham once says he started to talk about how jesus christ if you like to stand and the musicians would like to come up brother branham talked about you cannot put new wine into old wineskins you cannot put new wine into uh old bottles that they would use cowhide they would use that leather and and and that's where they would put their wine but if that leather that cowhide was old and dry it would break every time you put new wine in there because wine is a type of revelation and well wine does it's it's a ferment it's a fermented drink it's not like water no escomolagua it expands and it grows and it produces carbon dioxide carbon dioxide so it it causes the bottle to expand but if that old if that bottle is old that life is old it cannot take the revelation but whenever you make a new life when you get a new wine that has life inside of ita a certain way you won't but you allow that new life to come inside you pro and whenever the word says to do something whenever the word says it's wrong to do another thing martin luther wesley pentecost martin luther wesley you go to the same stage as they went through you are that living words lord i ask that it just this word can reach every person here lord cannot reveal it to them father only you can give them that life only you can give them that revelation lord i ask that you just touch him in a mighty way father give him strength that is lord we offer them every single person including us into your hands lord in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen and amen amen amen god bless you god be with you [Music] see this is [Music] oh [Music] see this oh [Music] is [Music] foreign [Music] is [Music] yes [Music] i am [Music] oh [Music] for me [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music]
