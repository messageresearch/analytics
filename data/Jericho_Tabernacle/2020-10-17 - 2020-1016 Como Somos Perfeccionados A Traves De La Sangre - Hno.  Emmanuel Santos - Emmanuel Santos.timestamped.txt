[18:35] [Music]
[18:54] me
[19:00] [Music]
[19:25] [Music]
[19:36] first of all we give you thanks
[19:40] for you have given us the breath of life
[19:42] today
[19:45] for you've extended your grace towards
[19:47] us once again
[19:49] just as your bible says
[19:53] that your mercies are renewed
[19:55] [Music]
[19:58] so we thank you for that grace and mercy
[20:02] and now lord this evening
[20:15] that we might be able to speak in a very
[20:16] simple way
[20:19] a very well understood way
[20:23] and lord i ask that you calm me down
[20:26] and that you would take control of this
[20:28] service
[20:29] that you bless my brethren that will
[20:32] hear
[20:34] [Music]
[20:36] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[20:38] amen amen
[20:46] as we're standing we're going to turn to
[20:47] the book of ezekiel 39
[20:49] 18.
[20:51] [Music]
[21:04] [Music]
[21:12] so that which i'm going to speak of this
[21:14] evening
[21:23] and if you remember what i spoke on last
[21:24] time i spoke about this scripture
[21:27] but i only spoke of one portion
[21:31] now we're going to speak of the other
[21:32] portion
[21:45] you shall eat the flesh of the mighty
[21:47] and drink the blood
[21:48] of the princes of the earth of rams of
[21:51] lambs
[21:52] and of goats of bullocks all of them
[21:55] fatlings of bishop
[22:00] now if we can also turn to psalms 22.
[22:11] [Music]
[22:13] now the scriptures of ezekiel 39 17 and
[22:16] 18.
[22:17] [Music]
[22:19] they speak of the two testaments
[22:23] [Music]
[22:24] but they also speak about the
[22:25] crucifixion of our lord jesus christ
[22:30] now if you remember in ezekiel 39 18.
[22:36] it says a variety of animals that there
[22:38] are carneros
[22:43] it says that there are rams lambs goats
[22:46] and bullocks
[22:48] all invasion
[22:52] now i'm going to explain why there were
[22:54] so many animals in the crucifixion
[22:57] in the crucifixion of our lord jesus
[22:58] christ
[23:04] the first verse is my god my god why
[23:07] hast thou forsaken me
[23:09] verse 7
[23:14] all they that see me laugh me to scorn
[23:20] they shoot out the lip and they shake
[23:22] their head saying
[23:29] he trusted on the lord that he would
[23:31] deliver him let him deliver him
[23:34] seeing he delighted in him verse 12.
[23:41] many bullocks have compassed me fuertes
[23:46] strong bulls of basian have beset me
[23:48] around
[23:54] they gaped upon me with their mouths as
[23:57] raving as
[23:58] a raving and roaring lion
[24:01] you may be seated
[24:08] so like i said in ezekiel 39 18. in
[24:10] english
[24:12] in english or in spanish
[24:16] it gives a variety of animals that there
[24:18] are in salmon
[24:20] in psalms 22
[24:24] those that are the bullocks those that
[24:27] are in basin
[24:30] those are the pharisees
[24:36] if you go into matthew 27 39 you'll see
[24:45] because the psalms it says strong bulls
[24:47] of basian have beset me round
[24:54] they gaped upon me with their mouths as
[24:56] raving and roaring lions
[25:17] and study the crucifixion of the lord
[25:19] jesus christ
[25:23] because the crucifixion is in matthew
[25:25] mark luke and john
[25:31] curiando verse 39
[25:35] and they that passed by reviled him
[25:37] waging their heads
[25:47] and saying thou that destroys the temple
[25:49] and buildest it in three days
[25:51] save thyself if thou be the son of god
[25:54] come down from the
[26:04] and i believe in spanish it only gives a
[26:06] certain amount of titles of the priests
[26:07] that are there
[26:08] they say
[26:16] likewise also the chief priest mocking
[26:19] him with the scribes and elders
[26:21] said does
[26:37] is that in the crucifixion of the lord
[26:39] jesus christ
[26:41] there were many animals
[26:44] there were like it says in ezekiel
[26:51] rams lambs goats and bullocks
[26:54] so then the bullocks
[26:57] those are the pharisees that they
[27:00] open their mouths speaking against the
[27:04] lord jesus christ
[27:06] jesus not just jesus the lamb
[27:10] crucifixion that was present at the
[27:12] crucifixion
[27:15] not just that animal was present
[27:28] so that you at home can read it more
[27:30] patiently
[27:43] [Music]
[27:59] the hill of god is as the hill of basian
[28:02] a high hill
[28:03] as a hill of nation
[28:13] now there were two scriptures that i
[28:14] told you i was going to explain
[28:17] ezekiel 39 17 and 18.
[28:21] in 18 it says invasion
[28:24] basan esta in palestine is in palestine
[29:02] and thou son of man thus saith the lord
[29:04] god speak
[29:05] unto every feathered fowl and to every
[29:07] beast of the field
[29:08] assemble yourselves and come gather
[29:11] yourselves on every side to my sacrifice
[29:14] that i do sacrifice for you even a great
[29:16] sacrifice upon the mountains of israel
[29:18] that ye may eat flesh
[29:20] and drink blood so then in 18
[29:38] crucifixion
[30:03] there and crows
[30:08] so it wasn't just jesus that was the
[30:10] only animal present at the crucifixion
[30:14] there was a variety of animals present
[30:16] at the crucifixion aura
[30:20] now season 18 that basin and this is
[30:23] an israel and in 17 it says in israel
[30:26] israel israel palestine and palestine
[30:31] they're this close
[30:34] there's a conflict
[30:47] to be the capital city of their state
[30:49] israeli palestina so israel and
[30:51] palestine
[30:53] their states jerusalem jerusalem
[31:01] now the mount in which jesus was
[31:02] crucified
[31:05] was on the outskirts of jerusalem
[31:08] it wasn't in jerusalem it was outside of
[31:12] jerusalem
[31:15] but first of all i want to show you that
[31:16] scripture
[31:19] psalms chapter 74
[31:28] for god is my king of old working
[31:31] salvation
[31:32] in the midst of the earth just israel so
[31:35] then israel
[31:39] is the god's central point for the earth
[31:46] and you should search for what brother
[31:47] branham says palestine
[31:50] in regards to israel and palestine
[31:53] because these are very significant
[31:55] places for us
[31:58] now
[32:09] and when they were come unto a place
[32:11] called golgotha
[32:12] that is to say a place of a skull
[32:17] so then the mountain in which jesus died
[32:21] was on the outskirts of jerusalem
[32:24] and it was called golgotha jesus
[32:38] it means a place of great suffering
[33:07] and the grave said i'll mold you
[33:20] i know i'm laying here in this roman
[33:22] dungeon
[33:25] bound in chains
[33:29] my wrists and hands and i've got 39
[33:31] stripes across my back
[33:35] i'm here with tears that are scalding my
[33:37] eyes
[33:39] until i can't see no more nope
[33:43] i can't see with my natural eye
[33:49] but can see a crown of righteousness
[33:51] laid up yonders
[33:53] my ankles are worn out
[33:58] i fell off so much from the old molded
[34:01] bread they throat in here
[34:04] foreign and the rats has run over me and
[34:07] the spiders in things
[34:11] [Music]
[34:16] but he could stand in the face of death
[34:18] and say donde
[34:33] grave don esta victoria where is your
[34:36] victory
[34:37] jesus crucification the reason why jesus
[34:40] was crucified
[34:42] so that you don't be crucified
[35:42] and jesus
[36:05] now i'm going to explain how jesus was
[36:07] taken unto the outskirts
[36:09] leviticus
[36:20] how many believe that jesus was a lamb
[36:22] that was sacrificed
[36:24] leviticus
[36:44] and the bullock for the sin offering and
[36:46] the goat for the sin
[36:47] offering whose blood was brought in to
[36:49] make atonement in the holy place
[36:51] shall one carry forth without the camp
[36:54] and they shall burn in the fire their
[36:56] skins
[36:56] and their flesh and their dung jerusalem
[37:00] jerusalem was the camp
[37:04] the sacrifice was taken
[37:33] was because the birth of jesus
[37:36] is an exemplary birth jesus the way that
[37:40] jesus was born
[37:43] is the way that every one of you must be
[37:45] born
[37:48] now the reason in which he came la
[37:49] manera que el vino the the way he came
[37:52] is as emmanuel
[37:55] emmanuel nosotros emmanuel is god with
[37:58] us
[38:00] but he doesn't want to be emanuel as
[38:02] your god
[38:16] that's the
[38:30] you'll have christ with you juan says
[38:34] now john 6 53
[38:38] jesus
[38:44] christ
[38:49] then jesus said unto them verily verily
[38:51] i say unto you
[38:52] except ye eat the flesh of the son of
[38:55] man and drink his blood
[38:57] ye have no life in you
[39:03] do you remember the last time i spoke to
[39:04] you all about the scripture in matthew
[39:06] como esque el dijo
[39:07] que les yo how it is that he gave him
[39:09] gave you bread
[39:11] and told them to eat les dior vino he
[39:14] gave them wine
[39:16] and he told them to drink
[39:21] now this bottle it was filled all the
[39:24] way up to here
[39:26] i just drank a little agua so then this
[39:30] water that was here
[39:31] it disappeared so then where's the water
[39:36] where is it it's in me correct jesus
[39:40] jesus
[39:54] because the blood of jesus
[39:58] i can't get into it but there's so many
[40:01] benefits
[40:04] receiving the blood of jesus
[40:07] so then you for now
[40:22] but there's so many benefits
[40:25] of jesus in drinking the blood of jesus
[40:33] it says except you eat the flesh of the
[40:35] son of man and drink his blood
[40:39] if you don't drink that blood you have
[40:42] no life in you
[40:45] that's why it's so important you've said
[40:46] accepted for you to accept
[40:48] el sacrificio de jesus the sacrifice of
[40:50] jesus
[40:52] the shed blood because that blood
[40:57] if you accept it you drink it
[41:01] and jesus is born in you
[41:05] [Music]
[41:19] i pray now if there be one here tonight
[41:27] who has never yet drank the real blood
[41:30] of the covenant
[41:31] in mateo donda in matthew where
[41:46] i've only explained to you because it
[41:48] says testament
[41:51] but i'd like to explain to you
[41:55] because it's also a covenant because the
[41:58] covenant we received
[42:00] it is
[42:16] and renew it
[42:23] until she was rejuvenated
[42:26] after then she could give a birth
[42:39] [Music]
[42:41] doesn't yet know what it means
[42:46] not yet drink the real blood of the
[42:48] covenant
[42:52] that doesn't know what it means to be
[42:54] born again
[42:56] if you drink that
[43:09] speaks to the same thing we're talking
[43:10] on today
[43:15] but the man as soon as the lamb finally
[43:17] died
[43:19] with the blood of the lamb
[43:25] upon his hands he walked from the
[43:27] building with the same desire in his
[43:28] heart
[43:30] so then in the old testament
[43:34] when they sacrificed the animals
[43:35] physically
[43:37] that life of those animals it wasn't
[43:40] enough
[43:42] to eliminate that sin and since it
[43:46] didn't eliminate that sins
[43:50] even though they were performing the
[43:52] sacrifices
[44:07] it's inferior to our human blood that's
[44:09] why i said
[44:10] jesus como sacrificio that jesus has the
[44:13] sacrifice
[44:16] but him also being human is the only
[44:20] human being perfect
[44:22] with perfect blood navi no one here
[44:28] perfect that they've got perfect blood
[44:30] solo jesus
[44:31] only jesus the only human being
[44:48] because
[44:55] [Music]
[45:03] the lasagna accept the blood
[45:12] for the the life that was in the blood
[45:15] was in uh
[45:15] in the lamb was in the blood
[45:44] therefore when it's little corp corp
[45:47] corpsicles were broken
[45:50] or those blood cells were broken
[45:54] when it came out of the animals it
[45:57] couldn't go back into the human being
[46:02] because an animal is inferior to human
[46:03] being
[46:07] only that blood of theirs like i told
[46:09] you
[46:12] it would only postpone judgment
[46:16] it wouldn't take away sin it wouldn't
[46:18] take away condemnation
[46:21] by being born in the wrong manner
[46:25] everyone here was
[46:38] that was born the perfect way for
[46:54] for that holy
[47:08] now leviticus 17 11.
[47:18] for the life of the flesh is in the
[47:22] blood
[47:50] there's life in the blood
[47:54] and the blood was used
[47:58] to make an atonement
[48:01] upon the altar of our souls so
[48:46] one day
[49:23] and i have given it unto you unto the
[49:25] altar to make an atonement for your
[49:27] souls
[49:31] for it is the blood that maketh an
[49:32] atonement for the soul
[49:36] now i'd like to explain to you all
[49:40] what it is that the blood does
[49:42] beneficial
[49:43] that it benefits us so much because like
[49:46] i've said
[49:49] the blood it has so many benefits
[49:54] in the blood
[49:58] are something called red blood cells
[50:02] red blood cells transport
[50:05] oxygen they transport oxygen
[50:09] throughout the entire body transport
[50:14] they carry oxygen through your body and
[50:16] and to your lungs
[50:19] obviously if someone cuts off for
[50:21] respiration
[51:05] there's life in your blood
[51:34] the blood of jesus it's just the
[51:37] beginning
[51:38] um one day this blood that we carry
[51:42] the jesus the blood of jesus
[51:47] the perfect body
[53:12] it carries oxygen
[53:24] it is the one that pumps to the heart
[53:28] and blood gets rid of
[53:31] the las toxinas of those toxins
[53:35] of that trash that's in your body
[54:10] [Music]
[54:35] but it also takes away the sin which is
[54:37] death
[54:40] do you see the benefits of the blood
[54:44] that's why you see you need to drink of
[54:45] that blood
[54:47] because the blood el dijo sangri he said
[54:49] blood no
[54:50] agua he
[55:34] but there is a spirit in man and the
[55:37] inspiration of the almighty
[55:39] giveth them understanding second english
[55:42] this is inspiration and i know that in
[55:43] english he uses the word inspiration
[55:48] but for both of us to understand both
[55:49] languages
[55:52] inspiration in both english and in
[55:53] spanish
[55:56] it's a very elevated word
[55:59] to you to say breathe
[56:12] [Music]
[56:13] but there is a spirit in man and the
[56:15] inspiration or the breath
[56:17] of the almighty give it the
[56:19] understanding
[56:21] the best the best way to receive
[56:26] the understanding of this bible
[56:55] through the blood of jesus
[57:01] you've got to be born of the blood for
[57:04] the blood
[57:06] is the best way
[57:09] to receive revelation of the bible
[57:24] is to be born
[58:20] that gives you the understanding of the
[58:22] bible
[58:25] now job 33 4.
[58:34] the spirit of god hath made me and the
[58:36] breath of the almighty hath given me
[58:38] life
[58:39] [Music]
[58:42] jesus so you see if you receive the
[58:43] blood of jesus
[58:47] it gives you a breath air oxygen
[58:51] it gives you understanding
[58:56] [Music]
[59:00] it takes away all of that sin that's in
[59:02] you
[59:04] that's why this blood of jesus
[59:08] it's the only perfect blood
[59:12] because one thing that god is is
[59:13] perfection he is perfection
[59:18] if you accept the blood that jesus gave
[59:21] it's a sign like histamine jesus that
[59:22] blood that was in jesus christ
[59:26] you will receive perfection in you
[59:30] and in that way
[59:44] it gives you the inspiration
[1:00:18] [Music]
[1:00:40] he never manufactured but he created a
[1:00:42] chemical in the blood of jesus christ
[1:00:46] just like you in susan you have a
[1:00:48] chemical in your blood
[1:00:51] that gets rid of the toxins so the blood
[1:01:13] [Music]
[1:01:23] el pecados introduco when sin was
[1:01:25] introduced
[1:01:27] in the human race
[1:01:32] we had fellowship with god
[1:01:35] but when sin was introduced
[1:01:39] there was a social distancing
[1:01:42] branham brother branham says
[1:01:48] you don't even bridge that chasm
[1:02:32] it takes
[1:03:10] with god
[1:03:54] [Music]
[1:03:56] you is the pandemia
[1:03:59] now this pandemic affected much has
[1:04:01] affected many espiritu
[1:04:03] spiritually but you all should take
[1:04:06] advantage
[1:04:10] of that social distance with the world
[1:04:11] but
[1:04:14] so you can have a social drawing close
[1:04:16] to god just
[1:04:20] i forget where brother branham says it
[1:04:25] but a tragedy took place in the world
[1:04:29] or with the israelites something that
[1:04:32] unto our eyes
[1:04:35] it looked like a tragedy but a decent
[1:04:36] amount of branham but brother branham
[1:04:38] says
[1:04:52] because if we take advantage of time
[1:04:54] correctly
[1:04:57] it will take away the social distance we
[1:04:59] had with god
[1:05:03] and it will draw us closer to have a
[1:05:05] social closening
[1:05:22] it's been god's tender hand
[1:05:30] says when you confess sin
[1:05:40] and god doesn't even know that you
[1:05:42] sinned at any point in your life
[1:05:43] yes that's right he said he
[1:05:48] lost put them in the sea
[1:05:52] of forgetfulness just like you
[1:05:55] enzo sangre in your blood you have a
[1:05:58] chemical
[1:06:01] that gets rid of the toxins
[1:06:15] that as soon as the ink falls into
[1:06:59] and it's destroyed at that moment
[1:07:02] it's a chemical that that bleach that
[1:07:04] clarks that chemical
[1:07:06] is it is their forgiveness
[1:07:10] it's in the blood of jesus
[1:07:20] [Music]
[1:08:36] one of the things that he knows how to
[1:08:38] imitate
[1:08:40] is your voice
[1:08:46] it seems like it's you talking to
[1:08:48] yourself
[1:08:50] what is
[1:10:00] and in the message
[1:10:12] and your sins are dropped into the
[1:10:14] bleach of the blood of the son of god
[1:10:18] it remits sin so much
[1:10:22] that it's put in the sea of god's
[1:10:24] forgetfulness
[1:10:27] now remember what i told you on the word
[1:10:28] to remit
[1:10:31] forgiveness for you all
[1:10:35] and that it will be returned back to
[1:10:36] satan
[1:10:38] also the word remit is that something is
[1:10:42] in one place
[1:10:44] it was sent to this place and then this
[1:10:48] that was sent
[1:10:50] is sent to another place
[1:10:53] your sins when they are remitted you are
[1:10:56] forgiven
[1:11:10] but
[1:11:21] i believe in the book of revelation it
[1:11:24] says
[1:11:26] speaks about how the the sea gave its
[1:11:27] own la tierra
[1:11:29] and the earth gave of its own and the
[1:11:32] books were open
[1:11:33] there will be a judgment but you all
[1:11:36] will not be judged
[1:11:52] because
[1:12:16] where you find holy and perfect life is
[1:12:19] in the blood of jesus
[1:12:48] that's what does make that man unicode a
[1:12:51] son of god
[1:12:52] [Music]
[1:12:55] god never remembers you to be a sinner
[1:12:59] you're a son you're a daughter
[1:13:15] that makes the sin disappear he says
[1:13:20] in the message
[1:13:23] the sea of forgetfulness
[1:13:27] is christ's blood that was said for you
[1:13:32] and therefore you and god
[1:13:37] our father and son
[1:13:41] by jesus christ's grace
[1:13:44] not for something
[1:14:36] and we know that the lord stayed with
[1:14:37] abraham
[1:14:39] to have fellowship el
[1:15:04] through the blood
[1:15:13] [Music]
[1:15:22] the musicians can also come forward
[1:15:26] and to our human eye
[1:15:29] to drink blood it's something crazy
[1:15:34] i would never do that
[1:16:03] in drinking the blood of jesus
[1:16:06] branham brother branham says
[1:16:11] there's only one there's only one way
[1:16:14] provided by god for anything
[1:16:17] preached in 1963 paragraph 253
[1:16:23] and if you close your eyes
[1:16:28] jesus how many want to drink the blood
[1:16:29] of jesus
[1:16:32] it's something that the bible clearly
[1:16:34] says
[1:16:36] that jesus said and juan says in john 6
[1:16:39] 50
[1:16:40] 53.

[1:16:45] jesus

[1:18:20] with abraham
[1:18:40] of jesus christ
[1:18:48] that was in that blood
[1:18:51] that's now in our hearts
[1:19:49] to be judged you won't be accused of
[1:19:54] jesus because the blood of jesus that
[1:19:57] came unto you like you don't break out
[1:19:58] that you drank it took away that seed
[1:20:01] we've confessed it
[1:20:16] we couldn't have any
