through all the day and all the days of our life in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may sit down how many of you know about the cloud that brother brandom saw in his vision this prophecy took place on December 22 1962 months after that Vision a man named Dr James McDonald investigated the cloud and he said that it was too high for a jet to make it science could not explain the event the cloud was about 26 mil long and 30 miles across this Cloud was 17 times higher than clouds can form and 15 miles higher than any airplane can fly This Cloud was Supernatural brother brandham said it was made by seven angels it was seen in a few different cities and three different states it traveled much faster than the wind speed that day there are many things that make this Cloud special I believe that the same Holy Ghost spirit that inspired the Bible gave brother brandham this Vision what does the cloud remind you of to me it looks like the face of our savior Christ I believe that it is a sign that God is always watching over us and that his return is near we must be very special to God because he Al allowed us to see this beautiful sign I hope these words give you Joy I'm going to read a quote brother Bram said on the message spiritual food in do season year 1965 they took the picture still they didn't know what about it here some time ago everybody saying looky here this looks like and then angel's wings how they followed in there one day turning it to the right looking there was Jesus Christ just as perfect as humman ever drawed him it was standing there with a white WI Wiig on looking back down towards the Earth showing that he is supreme authority the heavens declared it the Bible declares it the message declares it it all the same Let Us Praise the close thank you God for letting me say this to your children and thank you for this day and thank you for the food that's provided in the fellowship hall and thank you for this service in Jesus Christ name [Applause] amen uh the next speaker who's very special to all of us here at Jericho Tabernacle brother Eli can you please come up brother Eli Castillo put your hands together for brother Eli [Applause] Castillo we're good good that's good that's good can everybody um just say God bless you to each and every one of you guys and you guys can get up and if you guys want to take a blessing to somebody sister Sharon God bless you brother art just so we can get a little comfortable with each other God bless our brother Jeremiah amen yes amen he did really good good informing Us in of February 28th and um how beautiful it was and how important it is to what we believe right um today I want to speak about a little subject it's called the words that we speak um I know everybody we are all social creatures the way we contact and the way we we want to communicate with one another is the way is we talk to one another okay so first I want to give a a scripture it is in Psalms 3413 and it says then keep your tongue from speaking evil and your lips from telling lies so what job does our tongues do does can anybody tell us brother Roberto speak we speak what else Andrew what else what what what does our what's the job of our tongue brother Pepe I know I know lick ice cream oh lick ice cream yeah who who who uses their tongue to lick ice cream edano what what do we use our tongues for speaking the word oo speaking the word you that a good one eating eating sisters you guys have anything yep that's that's really really good that's what we use our tongues for um the Bible says that our tongue has power how does it have power in Proverbs 18:21 it says death and life are at the power of the tongue whoa oh boy that's pretty that's pretty strong right our power our tongue has power of death or life depending on what we say say to one another if we're happy we're going to say good things to our brothers and our sisters right but oh if they stole our toy or if they spoke bad about us oh we just want to call them something like who knows some some something that's not good right what do you think what do you think the words of death are does anybody can anybody give me an example for the Jeremiah hatred yes brother um like bad words bad words yep cursing um yelling at somebody um yell oh yelling back at our our parents yelling back at our siblings those are all words of death yeah somebody's raising their hand somewhere over there does somebody have an answer brother Boaz yes talking talking bad talking bad about somebody right we can be like hey friend and they be like oh you did you see the hair do that looks pretty funny that's that's talking bad that's words of death brother Andrew wow the 10 commandments says honor thy father and thy mother amen and how do we honor them we speak good words to them yes we speak so those that has power of of life and death and we've given a lot of examples of what the power of death is um have you ever heard who's heard this Saying sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me who's heard that it's a very very old phrase sticks I've heard it you've heard it yes sticks and stones will break my bones but words will never hurt me not true but the Bible says that it has power right Pepe has a lot of power and it hurts us more than sck Sticks and Stones because sticks and stones will heal from those things but a lot of times when we say something bad to our parents or we speak bad about our our our siblings or something like that that hurts them if we keep telling them oh you're short you're the shorty oh hey what's up shorty man that's going to stick with them oh man you're kind of slow you that's going that's really really going to hurt them and they're always going to think oh well I'm the slow one I can't run as fast as everybody else oh W I'm I'm the shorty here and they're always going to have that in their mind and that's speaking that's having the power of death what are the powers of the the uh Power of Life what what are words of life does any can anybody tell me Roberto like what give me an example oh I like that when somebody tells me that yeah God bless you Jeremiah that's a good one I love you you're doing good William God be with you anybody else Boaz how are you feeling o That's oh oh that opens the kind of works how are you feeling well brother let me tell you what let me tell you all about it what about you brother Pepe do you have any words of Life Words of Life are the word of God of oh speaking the word of God to somebody yes that is really good when you can speak the word of God and you can speak good words those are words of life and whenever we can tell our siblings man you're doing a good job man you look good today and you want to speak positive words it makes people feel good the Bible it says that God created the whole entire world now I know most of you young people you guys were in Sunday school but our brother Luis our associate pastor he preached a message about how the word is an original seed and he said how God created the whole entire world do you know how God created the whole entire world so so I saw brother Marcos brother Ramiro and brother Oscar and some other brothers I saw them build this in front of my eyes they Ed drills I they might have used a hammer they used other things so that they can build it so that's the tools we use to build houses and we build things but God uses a tool to build and create the whole entire world what is that can can everybody tell me his word that's how he created everything is by the words that he spoke the B the Bible tells us let no corrupt thing it's in Ephesians 4:29 it says let no corrupt thing or corrupt uh let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths but only such as is good for building up as fits the occasion that it may give grace to the hearer so there's three things that I see in that scripture first good good words positive words that we give to one another and we talk about one another it builds up we build up our friends we build up our family with positive and good words we build them up just like the brothers built this up just like God created the whole entire world by his good word we build up and we create good things by speaking good words to one another the second thing is it says as it is fit for the occasion what does that mean it means we speak when we're supposed to sometimes we want to just speak over other people sometimes sometimes we're talking and then you just so excited you want to talk talk to somebody and you speak over somebody or you want to get your point across so you just speak over people and or you say things when you're not supposed to the Bible says good words positive words you have to wait sometimes if you're having an argument with your brother or your sister if you're you're talking to them first a lot of times we want to speak over them and we want to say things and get our point across but sometimes we have to sit and we have to listen and maybe they say hey you did this and you did this and you're not waiting for your answer you're trying to understand them first that's what it means when it says speaking when it fits the occasion when you listen and you try to understand them then you have something to say in James it says understand this my dear brothers James 1:19 he says understand this my my dear brothers you must all be quick to listen are we quick to listen sometimes when mom wants us to clean the room when Mom says no you were wrong we're so quick to speak but the Bible says quick to listen then it says slow to speak and if you're slow to speak then you're slow to anger amen we don't want to let any anger in our lives but we want to control our words that we speak we have power in our words just like we heard brother Jeremiah those words are powerful that he said because he was speaking the word of God to us whenever we worship God just like our brother Andrew did those words are words of life and the Bible says praise to the Lord is like sweet smelling Sav to him he loves that he loves good words and good words are will build up somebody the third thing that Ephesians says that it may give Grace to those that hear now sometimes we might direct our our talk like I might be directing my talk to brother Pepe and I might be saying Pepe you were wrong here and you did this and you did that well it might hurt him but everybody else heard me too and now everybody else is affected not only Pepe but everybody else when we're yelling from one room to the other say no Mom I'm not going to clean my room and then everybody's like oh my goodness like oh we got to deal with that it affects everybody but when you speak and you speak directly to somebody it's giving Grace not only to the person you're speaking to but to everybody that he ears it gives Grace that's beautiful that's the power of your guys's words when you guys are at school and maybe somebody's bullying somebody or something is going on you can calm situations down you guys can make friends by the words that you speak by the things that you say it speaking life to people's lives the Bible says that our words are like seeds so we are just bunch of farmers we go with our seeds and if we're having a bad day we're planting bad seeds on everybody and we think everything is okay but they're all soil so they receive our seeds and it might be a seed of anger a seed of hatred whatever it might be but you're planting seeds in people and then they begin to grow according to what you tell them so that's why we have to speak words of life and we have to listen before we speak now now words of Life it'll give Grace to every single person now I'm not going to stick too long but brother um Ivan if you would like to pull up a a video who likes horses oh we love horses I got a little video of us just looking at some horses real quick and then I'll give you the context brother Ivan look how powerful those horses look as far as I know those are wild horses strong strong horses the Bible says in job 39:19 to 21 it says have you given power to the horse have you given the horse its strength or clothed its neck with flowing man did you give it the ability to LEAP like Locust it's Majestic snorting is it Majestic snorting is terrifying it's PAW it Paws the Earth and rejoices in its strength when it charges out to battle horses are very very strong creatures it it says that the average weight of an adult horse is about 900 to 2,000 lbs whoa that's a big animal right guys the average weight that a horse can carry is about 180 to 400 lb so that's a that's a it could carry a lot so we think sometimes when we get if we if anybody's everever gotten a horse we might feel like like uh the horse is is probably his back is hurting because we're on it but no we're like a little feather to it that's how strong a horse is its kick is like 2,000 lb then you never want to get be behind a horse because he'll kick the power of it the horse bite it can chop your finger off so these are strong strong creatures very very strong but the reason why I'm saying this is because in James 3:2 it says indeed we all make mistakes for if we could control our tongues we could be perfect and could also control ourselves in every other way wow so if we could control our tongues first the Bible says first we can be perfect second we can control ourselves our body in any way we we want because we control this little guy it says in in verse three it says we can make a large horse go wherever we want by means of a small bit in his mouth so imagine who can push a horse down let me see Hands raised not you Pepe I know you can but oh okay who can who do you think um can withstand the kick of a horse ad Mano Lise um who do you think can pull and win a Tuggle war with a horse I don't know maybe brother Lu brother B and brother Pepe but I don't know about anybody else but they're strong creatures we can't overpower a horse right guys they're too strong they carry 2 thou or they're about 2,000 pounds of weight but it says one little thing can control everything be do you have that thing that I told you to hold for me yeah do hold on one second one okay all right I know it's a little heavy one second one moment and don't don't it's not a horse okay guys all right buddy oh my goodness okay what is this you all right you almost took me oh sorry what is this for horses to make them go faster what is it it's a bridal she's right the Bible calls it a bit so you have the rains oh man I already forgot about this brother Junior told me brother Junior sanchz this is his he told me what this was I forgot but this part is the bit this part right here goes in the horse's mouth right here this little tiny thing is it bigger than a horse oh no we can I could throw it I could probably throw it pretty far too but it's not that big but this little bit the Bible says is like our tongue it's got power to control that big animal that we saw running in the fields that that big animal that we can't man we can't fight a horse and win no those big Majestic animals this little tiny thing will control the whole entire horse and the Bible says that our tongue is like this little bit that it'll control our whole lives our whole body our wherever we go it'll control us but it says if we can control this thing which is the tongue then we can control our bodies so the the the horse is easily maneuvered it becomes a very docile and very friendly creature yes Andrew right it's it's whoever is controlling the the bridal because that's controlling the horse this is I believe on his ear and then you're holding the reins like this it depends on who is holding the reins that controls that tongue right so it's it's God's spirit we're asking for the Lord to control and say Lord you put the words of God in my mouth Lord because I know if you can control this Bridal or this bit or this tongue Lord it'll control my whole life the Bible says if you can control your tongue you can be perfect and control everything about your life so it's whenever the I I know in school I don't know if you guys ever heard this but sometimes I'd get really angry by God's grace God changed me but I would get mad and I would want to say something to uh one of my schoolmates and my teacher would say if you don't have anything good to say don't say anything at all and sometimes we just want to blur something bad at somebody but if we don't have anything good it's better to control that tongue it's better to control our words and then whenever we're calm we're we're slow and we're quick to hear and we're slow to anger then we can speak speak out of love speak out of kindness knowing that our words have power and if if I say something bad it's going to hurt that person and maybe they'll say God bless you but they always feel hurt about it the Bible also says that the big ships that are controlled in the waves it's controlled by a little tiny Helm a little steering wheel these huge huge ships are controlled by a little tiny steering wheel so it's important what we do and how we speak to one another whether it's it's our family whether it's our friends at school whether it's somebody in church whatever it might be when we can give words of life and we can build up just like God did we can create good worlds and good things everything that God spoke do you know what he said whenever he he created the sky and the light in the darkness what did he say after he created everything this is kind of a hard question good job man he's good he said it is good everything he created he saw it because he spoke it and he said Ah that's good and ever whenever we talk to one another and we have good friends and we have good talking to one another we can say Ah that's good speak good words of Life the Bible also says while I'm closing here Pepe I'll I'll give this back to you let's see there there you go you take control of that but the Bible says that we can control every animal in the Earth did you know that guys what's a what's a ferocious animal a scary animal can somebody tell me Boos crocodile that's scary yes brother a a Bo a lion lion a jackal an ox any anything else oh what oh my goodness I can't even pronounce that word say it louder okay all right I can't I tried yeah boys all right oh my goodness three in one yes oh yes what a bull oh who who knows who controlled a bull with love brother brandom so so all of these animals how ferocious they are horses Lions whatever our brother said all of these things the Bible says we can all control them but we can't control our tongue wow so that's why in Jeremiah 1:9 it says then the Lord reached out and touched my mouth he said look I have put my words in your mouth and if we can go every single day saying Lord put your words in my mouth let me say something good to my friends let me say something good to my mom and my dad let me say something good Proverbs 1624 it says kind words are like honey who loves honey I love honey they're why are they like honey because they're sweet to the soul and healthy for for the body so good words and kind words heal people you want healing we want healing in our lives you want healing for your friends speak good words and they're more powerful than we even think so that's all I have just so that we can have good words for one another and whenever you see a friend or you see somebody even maybe somebody that doesn't like you too much you could say God bless you brother I love you God bless you sister I love you and project the love of God to each and every person Amen Let Us bow our heads and then as as we pray um afterwards I I believe we're going to have a news announcements I don't know if it's breaking news or it's just a regular news but we're going to have news from our Jericho team so let us stand to our feet real quick and brother Pepe if you like to get lead us in prayer yes of course I would everyone bow your heads precious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you for this wonderful service that you've allowed the beautiful children here at Jericho Tabernacle Lord and the ones that are watching also online Lord we we love you Lord Jesus and we want to love all of our brothers and our sisters and treat each other with respect Lord Jesus and and honor your Holy Name Lord Jesus we put these children in your hand Lord and we wait uh with expectation for our next Children's Service Lord that you be with us and that you encourage the young children to sing unto you Lord and to give specials and play their music I'm so happy with the young boys playing the piano Lord Jesus is such a great great sight to see Lord we thank you for this Lord Jesus bless these people in your holy name in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you guys may be [Applause] [Music] seated [Music] hello there and welcome to JTC news I am Ezra your host for tonight and I hope you all have had a blessed Sunday and I am so glad to have you all tuned in for tonight broadcast because it is a special one now I would like to start off by thanking Hester's workshop for building us this wonderful set don't you guys find it so cute because personally I am in love now to start off today's broadcast I would like to thank all the wonderful brothers that came to our church and blessed us with all the god L preachings that I am sure we can all agree were a tremendous blessing on January 12th brother George Smith gave us a wonderful testimony and I don't know what he said but I was there for a reason I wanted to get closer to his daughter now at that point i' had already read my Bible all the way through and I didn't know what this conversation was really all about but he was very nice but later I realized that during this conversation he was scanning the hard drive and he could see the whole picture I didn't know that but when we finished talking I had the Victory and he had the problem on December 12th we had brother Tito who preached a powerful message we talk about the 10 version about the foolish versions I remember all of that and when I go back into my memory I'm proud of what I did for God proud that I gave my life to the Lord I'm proud that I did what I could for him but there's something within me now that says what about these years what about these moments what about this day and most recently we had brother Frank bless us with a heartfelt preaching brothers and sisters but I'll tell you one thing tonight I believe God has done something in our hearts I believe that even those it's for a few minutes I believe you've understood what God thinks of you there's no mistakes God never made a mistake with you Brothers God never made a mistake I will tell you something you tell and stick that in the devil's face God did not make a mistake now I would like to say happy anniversary to our beautiful church building of 4 years oh my gosh I'm pretty sure half of you guys were and diapers back then now here's a video of our founding Pastor opening the doors of our church for the first [Applause] [Music] time now wasn't that a wonderful memory to revisit now we will be back after this short commercial break in a journey with God we discover how simple it can be to wander off from his loving path what is that anything for that party come on there's a party got to be some this something that hurts me like a good Savior Jesus is there let's go God is our refuge and strength always ready to help in times of trouble so don't forget to call on the name of Jesus it's always good to have a reminder that just a simple call and our savior will be there to help us out of trouble now for our last segment something I am so excited to talk to you all about and that is hey guys we're reporting from Pulpit Rock located in Northern Tucson otherwise known as Sabino cannon with my cameraman it was at this very spot that God gave brother Brandon the sword of the of the King on January of 1963 and a month later he was raptured up to the sky in the famous Cloud about another 4 41 miles Northeast from here then another month later he returned to Jeffersonville to preach the Seven Seals and now we are going to take it back to the station with Ezra so she can tell us a little bit more about the cloud back to you thanks Kenny for giving it back to my show anyways back to what I was talking about my favorite topic for tonight and that is is the amazing Arizona phenomenon the cloud or that weird Arizona calls it the Ring of mystery this phenomenon appeared 61 years ago which is kind of old but I also have
