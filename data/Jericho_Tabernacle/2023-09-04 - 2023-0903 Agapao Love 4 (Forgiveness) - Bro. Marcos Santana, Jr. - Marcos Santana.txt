each and every one of you again this morning I'm really happy to be in the house of the Lord today it's really good to hear this morning I want to thank the Lord for the opportunity to be here also to our pastor and associate pastor for the opportunity to speak this morning [Music] and we say we all know that they're out of town today so let's continue to keep them in our prayers I really like the lyrics of that song as I was reading it [Music] it's uh his Divine love is unerasable it's so beautiful you know this morning uh well the thought that the Lord placed on my heart I've said it before but I'm not much of a serious type of Minister not like my brother who could give us 20 series back to back but this morning we're going to continue with the series on agapo love I believe the last one I spoke on was many months ago and if you remember the first one was on love thy brother as thyself have we been able to love our brother as ourselves and if we haven't have we been trying to love our brother more and more [Music] we spoke number two was on correction and the number three was standing in the Gap this morning I'd like to give a subtitle yes of forgiveness forgiveness goes a long way so if you be so kind of marvelous let's go to Matthew 22. we're going to jump all the way down to verse 36. and this was or has been the base scripture for this series Matthew 22 36 reads [Music] says Master which is the great commandment in the law is Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy Minds how many want to do that this morning this verse 38 says this is the first and great Commandments now if you turn over to the Book of Luke chapter 23. and then scroll all the way down to verse 34. this will be the scripture for this morning Luke 23 34 Lucas then said Jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do Jesus Lord Heavenly Father Celestial we thank you God for another Resurrection Sunday you've allowed us to come to service we humble ourselves and open our hearts to your presence this morning we ask that you would speak to us today don't be harsh with us today but just give us your unadulterated word father sometimes it hurts and sometimes it feels so good yeah but if we've understood what agape love is it's more than just a human emotion is mass since is more than a human sensation but it is a Godly perfect love Perfecto we give you thanks this morning give us more of that love this morning and just speak to us today continue to protect our pastor and assistant pastors your perfect will be done this morning we ask all these things and we give you the honor and glory glory in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated once again the title is forgive agape love number four and the subtitle is forgiveness the dictionary definition for forgiveness definition it says it's the action or the process of forgiving or being forgiven this is so it sounds like the dictionary says a two-part process definition the action and the process when you forgive somebody there's a an act that's done through the lips or through your voice and there's an act that's performed that we can't see in the Heart It is and then there's the process as the definition says maybe if we can stretch the process we could say there's the thought of wanting to forgive the struggle trying to forgive the prayer it's taking for God to help me to forgive us the healing and the ceiling we get from God when we can finally forgive is forgiveness that is a process to get to forgiveness and the American Psychological Association also has a definition for forgiveness it says forgiveness involves willfully putting aside feelings of resentment towards someone that's committed wrong and it's harmed you in some kind of way forgiveness is not merely accepting what happened or ceasing to be angry but it involves a voluntary transformation of your feelings of your attitudes so that you're no longer dominated by resentment and you can express Compassion or the like toward the person that wronged you just like the dictionary definition it popped out to me in two parts in the beginning it says it's willfully you willfully put inside those feelings now I believe willfully many times we can't put those feelings aside but we can't erase those feelings or those emotions and then it says that voluntarily there is a voluntary transformation of your feelings now voluntarily we can't transform ourselves the psychologists and the psychiatrists they're on the right path but we can't voluntarily transform uh what's inside of us and Once In His Hands I can be transformed where voluntarily he can transform me and change me give me forgiveness voluntarily I can accept him and I can voluntarily ask him for help in my life and he can Transformer so the I don't hold the grudge to my brothers hatred and anger towards my sister so the guard can change my mind he can change my heart towards my brothers my thoughts about my brother my feelings I have about that situation I went through he can change my attitude and my behavior toward my brother or sister so that we're no longer dominated by that resentment you know psychiatrists they do a good job but they can only understand what the mental understanding is so thank God for a profit they helped us understand what the spiritual understanding is we could understand by divine revelation these things something so simple as forgiveness but so vast as forgiveness but now if we go back in the Bible and we go back to the Book of Genesis we don't want to get too deep into that but we know how we were supposed to come into existence by the power of the spoken word Adam was the original spoken word creation is and Jesus was that type of that Born Again spoken word creation Jesus the devil interfered with God's plan and instead of the spoken word the woman fell the man fell and now every human existence is born in it is attracted to that sin of the world because our very birth is a sinful nature is in the message questions and answers every man that's born of a woman that don't take much understanding every man that's born of a woman is deathbound he's dead when he's born and you look at Psalms 51 51 5. David's saying behold I was shaping an iniquity and in sinned in my mother conceive me this is very simple doesn't take much understanding we are born with the sinful nature we're bound to death it's almost so in the thinking man's filter brother Brown says that when you come into this world you were born in sinustion we all know this you didn't even come with a Fighting Chance you were born in sin it is you were shaped in iniquity you come to the world speaking lives within your own Spirit the desire of sin then a lover of sin because you were born in sins you didn't even have a chance you know I'm remembering the testimonials our sister Destiny gave Friday how she was saying she she was still holding on to these things of the world foreign if you haven't been baptized if you haven't been redeemed already then you're just a ticking time just waiting to die with no hope of an eternal life but let us all remember that God is love and not just any kind of love what is the highest kind of love there is a perfect love perfect and therefore he made a way for salvation when he wanted to display forgiveness through that love he made a way back in the Garden of Eden when he he had that that land that Bloodshed there you know God created us because he wanted somebody that he can love but he wanted that same love to be reciprocated back to him and the only way we can reciprocate that love to him we've got to be born again we've got to have the Holy Spirit within us because any other kind of love madora I I don't want to apply myself to the they that they're talking about you know there's a new group of the days and the thems that they're talking about they don't want to accept the him and the hers the she and the he's so when I read this that in vain do they worship me I'm not one of the days I'm one of his he said they honor me with their lips their heart is so far from me so he told them depart from me I never knew you yeah I don't want to be that person that day you know you can't love God with any other love it Agape you know if we keep reading on our base scripture the next scripture following it says that second and equally of the greatest Commandments is to love thy neighbor as thyself to agapo your neighbor as yourself and forgiveness is a part of that agape love is so God gives Grace God extends God gave us forgiveness for every single one of our sins then we should at least be able to forgive one sin for my brother the sin that my brother committed contra first first John 4 21 says just to kind of nail it in a little bit and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth God does everyone love God this morning he loveth his brother also so this morning if you look to your left and you look to your right you need to love your brother and your sisters to nail it in just a little bit more these Scriptures it kind of describes a little bit of the bitterness someone might carry if they haven't been able to love their brothers they haven't been able to forgive their brother Ephesians 4 31 efficiency all bitterness clamor criteria evil speaking to be put away from you well what happens sometimes when we can't forgive I start getting bitter towards my brothers I can't be around him I start to have a wrath in my heart towards him and then there's the anger that develops in me towards him and there's an evil speaking that every chance I cannot speak negative about him all together as the Bible says it's wrapped up in a malice towards him but verse 32 but be ye kind to one another this is be a sweetheart with one another forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you so if God has forgiven me and I want to be like Christ and I've met all the attributes and I'm just like him in every way I've also got to learn how to forgive and not just from the surface but on the inside where it matters we're the only one that truly knows if you've forgiven done law is you and God because the brother can't see into my heart and I can't see into his heart but God looks into every one of our hearts you see we have no Escape you know if we have the Holy ghosts and we claim to be like Christ then we must display all those attributes to our brothers and our sisters including the most difficult forgiveness it's easy to give Grace to those that that you like to those that you hang out with but give a little bit of Grace so that brother you just can't stand so that brother that harmed you or hurt you give them forgiveness prove the scriptures to be true if I love God then I've got to love my brothers and I don't love my brother because of what he did to me this one but the I inside of me the spirit in me if we're feeling that one more time like our sister Destiny was saying on Friday of the white dog and the black dog if I feed that black dog flesh that he offended I'm going to keep on hating my brother but if I keep feeding the white dog me inside of me I'm gonna love my brother through all of that hardship difficult and that's the one we need to feed if we want to give that forgiveness you know when I think of heaven and eternal life I've heard ministers preach and they start talking about you know making it to Heaven get into eternity walking through those Gates you know we know that there's a saved body of Believers that church that will be saved those that will go through the tribulation and some that will reach salvation they'll reach salvation there's a raptured body a bride who's going to be saved we're tired of 144 000 Jews that will be saved the dead in Christ that will be saved the Saints and Believers of the old testamentos you know all of them are going to make it to heaven and I say Amen these are our brothers and our sisters because of the life they live because they strive to be the best Christians that they could say is they heard a message for their days and they believe their message they heard a gospel so they will get their rewards of eternal life we know this right no I mean you can call me a little crazy but I couldn't get this out of my head you know God's grace us I believe it extends Way Beyond that okay God's love extends Way Beyond those that we just mentioned and those we mentioned that they will obtain eternal life you know in Matthew 25 40. it says and the King shall answer and say unto them verily I say unto you he said in as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of my brethren okay you have done it unto me so prior to this scripture it was talking about separating the goats and the sheets and as he explains this it narrates that that those that received eternal life they were they were like confused they didn't understand when did we give you to eat Jesus Jesus when did we clothe you when do we do this and that to you maybe there's going to be those I didn't even know Jesus I never even heard of Jesus anybody in this world but there's going to be a different group of people the outside of those that we mentioned apart that accepted Christ that got their salvation they received that they too will receive eternal life they will be granted entrance into that Kingdom because of exactly what we just read foreign each and every one of you this morning the day that you needed a job you didn't know what you were going to do for money and that man called you up and offered you a job that day you needed a place to live and you couldn't find the exit in your life you were given a place to live yeah whatever it was in your life that small little gesture from some worldly Persona mundana who had no hope no part with Christ for that small insignificant thing they did in your life foreign we advocate for them we say Lord let them in and at that moment when God looks over to them they will be granted forgiveness in that very instant forgiveness must be forgiven at that moment because sin cannot enter into Heaven Sin needs to be raced and destroyed since our sins are casting to see a forgetfulness so that person that worldly ungodly persona persona at that moment and it's a momentum they'll be forgiven they'll be given Grace they'll be gifted entrance into heaven and that's by the power yes that that long reach that agape love has reached me God's grace reached me it reached you and when you caught it and how many Sinners with our lives and God's grace and his forgiveness are we going to be able to reach on that day when they'll be accepted into the Kings you know it blows my mind because they don't even know it it's one thing for each sinner here this morning they remember the day and he was bound with them that made and I had to look that word up the Insurrection it's a violent Uprising against a government so this this Barabbas he was a terrorists so he was bound or Shackled up with the rest that uh with the rest of the terrorists and they had committed murders no brother Brandon says and I'm getting into the scene of Barabbas in his life I don't know if Barabbas had ever even heard of Jesus maybe he never had maybe he did hear of Jesus he had an opportunity to be to get forgiveness but he didn't accept it and now he found himself in this condition and brother Branham narrates in that beautiful message God's wrapped gifts must have felt that day he said Barabbas that Outlaw that was caught he was put down and thrown in the galleys that he was going to die the next morning how he was a thief he was an outlaw he was a murderer he was a criminal and that all night long the night before he was going to be put on the cross says he was walking up and down the jail and up and down the jail this is just pulling out his hair because the next morning he was going to go to the cross and receive capital punishment [Music] that he would die how the nightmares passed over him that night he couldn't rest at all brother Branham says and that the next morning the Judgment morning he didn't have no breakfast or anything like that he knew that his blood would be strung out amongst the wolves and all at once he starts to hear those chains clinging and and those those soldiers they were tramping in yeah brother Brown says maybe it was five or it was a battalion of Roman soldiers on their way [Music] and they walked up there and as the Jailer he turned that key yes he says oh don't kill me have mercy upon me you know I I think of that story he wasn't pleading for salvation he wasn't playing for his soul he just didn't want to die he knew he deserved it but he didn't want to be killed he would have been fine spending a life sentence in prison but his punishment was our punishment Barabbas was destined for death on the cross for he was yelling have mercy on me don't kill me there's nothing wrong you're free it is what did you say community Houston you're free it is Libre how did I come free I'm supposed to be killed today I'm supposed to be on the cross today you know that cross in between those two male factors that was not for Jesus but Jesus came and took his place and point it up that way yeah I could imagine up that way and Jesus all the way there at the end at the cross Jesus hang in there brother Brandon says oh what it must have meant to Barabbas to have seen the gift that took his place to see that lamb that took his place please see the life that took his place on the cross and took that death when he deserved death says I felt that same way when God's gifts that took my place I can identify with brother Brandon now he took my place I look back in my life I didn't deserve it but I'm here but how he must have failed he had no idea about Jesus but yet even to his surprise he was forgivenado Jesus died on the cross for him he died on the cross for each and every one of you yeah you know when Jesus was up on the cross he cried out some words they were so difficult I'ma just speak for myself they're so difficult to say and you know the words we read them when we started this message father father forgive them for they know not what they do father father forgive him he doesn't know what he did to me the father forgive her father she doesn't know what she's done to me that's hard for me it's very hard for me I don't know if it's hard for you but if we want to be like Christ we've got to learn to forgive because forgiveness is a part of that and he said forgive them if I want to see I can look to that cross I can stay right at that cross if I don't know how to read anything else in this Bible look to the Cross within this Bible and everything that I need to know everything that I need to see everything that I need to have is right there that day on calendar forgiveness was right there Grace was right there salvation was right there on that cross you know just imagine all right Jesus Jesus with that heavy burden all upon him the millions of criticisms the constant persecution for years one of his disciples turned on he turned him in one of his disciples denied him God's Own people the Jews rejecting him to his face it must have took a Spirit-filled man the holy spirit of God in the midst of all those things that he could say father forgive him and I struggle to say father forgive one person and he said father forgive all of them when I hear those words father forgive them what comes to me okay Vietnamese is that God is eternal and being that he's Eternal those words we're not bound to the boundaries of times no if the word says Heaven's in Earth shall pass but my word shall never die I've like visualized to myself like an explosion at that moment moment that broke through the dimensions of times that went back into the ages to Grant forgiveness forgiveness forgiveness forgiveness broke through the ages of time and went through seven ages to give forgiveness forgiveness forgiveness is to forgive our brother and our sisters you know there will be a day around here where your brother your sister will offend you maybe that's going to be intentionally maybe that'll be done with a malice towards you and yes it's going to hurt maybe it'll last a week maybe it'll last for a few years the power to restore if we've got the holy ghosts we've got the power to be restored you can ask the fathers ask him for the strength to be able to forgive so that you can stand in the gap for your brothers you can stand in the gap for your sisters just like with Joseph say life went full circle where he was he was thrown into slavery by his own brothers and then the day came in his life where him with power and authority he could have destroyed every single one of his brothers but he exercised of forgiveness to his brothers you might be faced with that situation with the problem maybe you're going through it right now with a brother or a sister maybe in this church maybe in another church and I know it's not easy but you know they may never ask you for forgiveness it on but but it's still my responsibility my responsibility to forgive them they might not never ask for forgiveness but it's my responsibility to forgive him God will deal with them if they ask for forgiveness or not but God's going to deal with me if I forgive them or not so let's not wait until this for my brother to ask me for forgiveness because the day might not ever come we can intercede we can forgive them with all of our hearts foreign it says that Jesus said unto a certain person he called him a friend right before he was taken captive and this person that he called a friend you know and Jesus is still and always going to be our example Jesus going to be betrayed he had just gotten the kiss of betrayal yet he still called this man his friend Judas I don't believe that was a sarcastic way of saying it sarcastic no he's he meant that my dear and precious friends it came from a place of agap of love and right before Jesus began the foot washing Jesus he also said these words every he said but everyone is clean ye are all clean but not all this is in John 13 10. and in verse 11 it said for he knew who should betray him this is therefore he said you are not all clean foreign because I have a different relationship with my brother Flores foreign we have a different bond with each other but we all claim to love one another now how much more would you forgive or would you not forgive the pastor versus your wife how much more or less would you forgive the minister over your son and daughter how much more or less would you forgive anybody for that sake over your best friend should there even be a difference in how much we would forgive in uh if we should forgive or could forgive us you know I believe Jesus when he washed every single one of the disciples feet he gave them so much love and so much attention he must have been praying so hard for each and every one of us and he didn't leave Judas out and when he got his feet he gave him a quick little slap down and put them back away if he is he washed judas's feet the betrayer the liar the cheater Elementary just as good if not better than the rest of the disciples because he loved him with a Godly love not an Earthly love that fluctuates with our emotions fluctuates with our feelings you know when we come to communion when it comes time for us I don't know if you might be this Persona nor are you the one that wants to run and go stand next to your friends so that you can wash his feet or her feet or go run and try to team up with the brother or sister you get along with the one that invites you to coffee all the time the one that always takes you out for some fellowship after church that's easy to wash their feet you oh you love this Brothers you even take a couple of extra minutes on that feed in those toes but can we wash the feet of the brother that hurt us to the court watch the field of the sister that has slandered your name the brother or sister that hurt you so bad whoever it is that person that's hurt you so much can we wash their feet like Jesus washed judas's feet like Jesus called him friends like Jesus that loved him all the way to the end and when I say wash their feet you know it's like when you get a brand new car yeah you don't wash the car you just throw a bucket of soap on it and you hold it down for 10 seconds and let it dry out fall dirty no we get in there we give it a good detail the rims and the hood and the entire cars and remember I'm talking about washing my brother and sister's feet can we get down and dirty and wash their feet foreign we start scrubbing the bottom and scrubbing the top and doing it over and over and over you couldn't tell me when to stop because I'd be praying and crying and praying and crying and praying for my brother my sister my brother I know he hurt me but heal
