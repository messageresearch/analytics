[1:03:42] and we pray that whatever your hearts
[1:03:44] desire whatever you have in your mind
[1:03:50] may god grant to your desire
[1:03:54] we know that we're living in a terrible
[1:03:57] time
[1:04:00] but at the same time we're living in the
[1:04:01] most glorious times
[1:04:05] in the coming of the lord jesus christ
[1:04:10] it's it's hard and sad to say that we
[1:04:12] are living at the end time
[1:04:17] we're living in a time when end was time
[1:04:20] will cease
[1:04:23] and we're just going back to eternity
[1:04:28] because we came from eternity
[1:04:33] but we're going back to eternity
[1:04:37] well there will be no more sorrow
[1:04:41] sickness disappointments
[1:04:45] we'll be with him our our savior the
[1:04:47] lord jesus christ
[1:04:51] how many love him today quantus and
[1:05:32] now that's easy to say it is
[1:05:38] the bible tells us the man should live
[1:05:40] by every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:05:41] mouth of god
[1:05:46] now us who understand the plan of
[1:05:48] redemption
[1:05:53] a process and a requirement
[1:05:57] for us to go back to eternity
[1:06:01] and that is that we have to believe
[1:06:02] every word that proceeds out of the
[1:06:04] mouth of god
[1:06:07] we have to be obedient and to get there
[1:06:12] are certain requirements today i would
[1:06:15] like to speak to you a little bit about
[1:06:16] something that's very simple
[1:06:21] i could say it in 10 minutes
[1:06:25] but you know brother branham was very
[1:06:26] long-winded
[1:06:30] i don't know how people did it back in
[1:06:32] those time maybe because we were living
[1:06:33] in a different time i don't know
[1:06:39] but brother brown preached two or three
[1:06:41] hours sometimes
[1:06:44] and now today well it's hard for
[1:06:46] somebody to sit down and hear
[1:06:47] tape for one hour
[1:06:52] we're so restless and desperate we got
[1:06:54] to go do this and this this
[1:06:56] the other and no
[1:07:13] we what we must do
[1:07:17] i would like to present my own ideas
[1:07:21] but my ideas my thoughts it's it's trash
[1:07:26] no good it's got to be according to what
[1:07:28] god has brought us today and this time
[1:07:34] the thoughts of god brought to a prophet
[1:07:39] and he spoke to us
[1:08:09] you know but uh some of you might
[1:08:12] question what i say
[1:08:13] where did you get that from that
[1:08:16] question
[1:08:22] wow it's my style oh there's music
[1:08:25] i'm made up you know brother baby says
[1:08:27] just be yourself
[1:08:31] i don't ever try to be like nobody else
[1:08:35] i think people will take you accept you
[1:08:38] better yo
[1:08:39] yourself
[1:08:42] if you're like really mickey mouse
[1:08:46] you know but people admire that you are
[1:08:49] that you are what you are
[1:08:59] or somebody is trying to prove a point
[1:09:01] or something you know and trying to
[1:09:02] really glorify themselves
[1:09:18] what is our principal theme what is this
[1:09:21] principal to raise raise up a man
[1:09:26] raise up a church a creed
[1:09:30] an idea an idea our
[1:09:33] principal theme principal is to raise
[1:09:36] up jesus christ
[1:09:40] and nobody is better than anybody else
[1:09:44] and everybody has this place
[1:10:40] likewise in the mystical body of jesus
[1:10:42] christ
[1:11:11] right
[1:11:16] i understand so what we want to do today
[1:11:19] is we want to look at god's plan
[1:11:24] is
[1:11:31] i think that's one of the main things
[1:11:32] right now that is really
[1:11:34] working on the human race is
[1:11:53] a certain decision should i buy this
[1:11:54] house or that house
[1:11:58] should i go to this church should i go
[1:12:01] to that church
[1:12:03] uh should i do this business transaction
[1:12:05] or that business transactions
[1:12:20] i when i picked my wife i had to discern
[1:12:25] it if this was going to be the right one
[1:12:26] for me or not yes
[1:12:30] now i already knew that there were
[1:12:31] certain qualifications qualifications
[1:12:48] but you know really really
[1:12:52] um i think i made the right choice
[1:12:56] well i've been married 46 years ago
[1:12:59] and i've been very happy for 46 years
[1:13:03] now i don't know about her
[1:13:06] but me i'm fine
[1:13:10] i understand now
[1:13:13] i had to use a little bit of discernment
[1:13:15] there right all right tuberculosis
[1:13:30] i picked the right one because it was
[1:13:33] all
[1:13:33] nothing but the grace of god
[1:13:38] just the grace of god so you pick the
[1:13:41] right woman the right wife
[1:13:42] you do this right and that right
[1:13:44] whatever you do right it's the grace of
[1:13:45] god
[1:13:49] and sometimes we make mistakes in life
[1:13:53] we don't discern things very good
[1:13:57] we do wrong a wrong choice
[1:14:01] and then we pay the consequences
[1:14:04] but it's still the grace of god but i
[1:14:08] believe that
[1:14:09] brother branham tells us
[1:14:12] to avoid the least amount of problems
[1:14:19] we need to discern things
[1:14:22] i know as human beings we're all a mess
[1:14:25] jose como
[1:14:26] somanos tosun
[1:14:40] because he
[1:14:54] to overcome
[1:15:07] he took on time el tomor
[1:15:11] before the foundation of the world
[1:15:15] no merits no nothing is not what you did
[1:15:17] it's just the grace of god the
[1:15:18] predestination of god
[1:15:46] let's get a little focus here and
[1:15:49] express to you the thought that i have
[1:15:50] today
[1:15:55] and i'm going to tell it this way
[1:15:58] discernment
[1:15:59] of spirit de espirito
[1:16:03] brother brown preach the message to
[1:16:04] sermon of spirit element
[1:16:08] how many you've heard that tape that's
[1:16:11] what i want to talk about a little bit
[1:16:12] today
[1:16:14] so let's go into some of the scriptures
[1:16:18] the scripture that
[1:16:24] it seems like it didn't even like a
[1:16:26] demon have anything with to do with that
[1:16:28] message
[1:16:30] but i believe it's got everything to do
[1:16:32] with that message
[1:16:44] but strong meat belongs to them that are
[1:16:47] of full age
[1:16:53] even those who by reason abuse have
[1:16:55] their senses
[1:16:57] exercised to discern both good and evil
[1:17:14] abuse have their senses exercised
[1:17:18] to discern both good and evil
[1:17:26] you know everything we do in life we
[1:17:28] need to discern it
[1:17:39] but unconsciously we still keep doing
[1:17:40] the bad things
[1:18:25] don't take nice steps and then before
[1:18:28] you
[1:18:28] you find yourself inside of a web
[1:18:35] in a spider web so tangled up and say
[1:18:39] wait a minute how did i get myself in
[1:18:40] this
[1:18:41] fix
[1:18:44] in this situation you took too many
[1:18:47] steps
[1:18:51] the situation and that's the way a lot
[1:18:53] of people are they get themselves in
[1:18:55] trouble
[1:18:57] how did i get in this mask you didn't
[1:19:00] process it
[1:19:04] but the word of god is
[1:19:18] some people don't even know how to
[1:19:20] discern between good
[1:19:27] and whatever still walmart home depot
[1:19:29] wherever i go
[1:19:31] home depot and i see so many
[1:19:35] naked women well
[1:19:38] semi have naked women anyway
[1:19:42] even men lost men without pants on
[1:19:45] hombres in pantalones and they cat
[1:19:47] discerned inopened
[1:19:49] kind of a spirit they have okay classes
[1:19:53] why would a woman want to walk around
[1:19:57] almost half nude
[1:20:00] and show her body to other men
[1:20:16] you know like a free happy-go-lucky
[1:20:19] anything's allowed yep
[1:20:21] it's okay
[1:20:25] and then they walk around with shorts
[1:20:28] and you know you have to turn your head
[1:20:58] carnal oh no or is it something that
[1:21:02] just what we
[1:21:02] we go by the eyesight
[1:21:06] now turned over first corinthians 2 12
[1:21:09] and 13.
[1:21:13] now we have received not the spirit of
[1:21:15] the world
[1:21:19] but the spirit of which is of god
[1:21:22] how many can say amen to them how many
[1:21:25] believe if we have received the spirit
[1:21:26] of god
[1:21:29] that we might know the things that are
[1:21:31] freely given to us of god
[1:21:36] they're freely given
[1:21:55] comparing spiritual things with
[1:21:57] spiritual acomodando
[1:21:58] spiritual allah spiritual you gotta have
[1:22:01] a spiritual lie
[1:22:02] in this age
[1:22:06] this is the most deceiving age that ever
[1:22:08] existed
[1:22:23] but the natural man receives not the
[1:22:25] things of the spirit of god
[1:22:31] for they are foolish unto him
[1:22:34] neither can they know them
[1:22:39] [Music]
[1:22:43] wow that's so awesome to me
[1:22:47] you know some people just don't get it
[1:23:47] is my objective i'm only trying to do
[1:23:49] one thing brothers
[1:23:52] my purpose in being in this message
[1:23:56] is not to glorify myself no is the glory
[1:24:00] i want to lift up
[1:24:27] is in the church today is
[1:24:31] crying to the people
[1:24:36] what i have gathered and when you see
[1:24:40] separation
[1:24:42] and
[1:24:48] i mean you tell me if that doesn't exist
[1:24:50] in this message all right
[1:24:53] you know we're supposed to be one big
[1:24:56] church
[1:25:24] am you know i've gone down to mexico
[1:25:29] mexico and there's hundreds of churches
[1:25:31] iglesias and none of them fellowship one
[1:25:33] with the others
[1:25:36] because of doctrine let
[1:25:52] is
[1:26:04] they believe in the return ministry of
[1:26:05] the prophet of god
[1:26:19] but i think it's ridiculous
[1:26:22] because brother bottom explains to us
[1:26:26] the road map
[1:26:31] and the road and the points that you
[1:26:32] have to go to different
[1:26:34] points
[1:26:55] amen amen even if you pull out your gp
[1:26:59] whatever you call it
[1:27:02] you got to come back to the word of god
[1:27:05] okay now when you see separation and
[1:27:08] differences
[1:27:11] and brotherhood broken up
[1:27:15] and christian life
[1:27:29] if jesus did
[1:27:54] let's try to follow this road map here
[1:27:55] now
[1:27:58] let's hear what brother baum says in the
[1:27:59] message discernment of spirits
[1:28:05] you're trying to achieve something a
[1:28:08] true prophet of god
[1:28:11] a true teacher is
[1:28:20] now if you believe what brother brown
[1:28:22] said
[1:28:24] you believe what i'm telling you what
[1:28:25] i'm reading to you what he said
[1:28:30] a true teacher is trying to bring the
[1:28:31] church to a unity of spirits
[1:28:38] a unity of spirit um
[1:28:44] trying to achieve it no matter what
[1:28:46] denomination they belong to
[1:28:53] what about it
[1:29:03] to see if it be the spirit of god or not
[1:29:10] talking there johnny alvarado johnny
[1:29:12] alvarado that's what the prophet of god
[1:29:14] is telling
[1:29:14] what is he telling us the unity of the
[1:29:17] spirit
[1:29:21] now there's not two men in the world
[1:29:25] that will agree on everything
[1:29:28] how many knew that me and my wife
[1:29:31] don't even agree on everything
[1:29:35] there's many people here that don't
[1:29:37] agree with me
[1:29:39] and i don't agree with you but does that
[1:29:42] give us the rights
[1:29:49] for me to this fellowship with you
[1:30:04] that i can ask a brother to come into
[1:30:06] our church
[1:30:09] even though he might believe something
[1:30:11] different than me
[1:30:13] now if it's way way off
[1:30:17] and he's trying to bring to you that
[1:30:19] there's three gods
[1:30:22] i know there's a filter there and it's
[1:30:24] going to be it's only to a certain limit
[1:30:29] but if the brother is a precious a
[1:30:31] brother of like precious faith
[1:30:36] and he doesn't agree with everything
[1:30:37] that i agree with
[1:30:40] and he comes up here and he says
[1:30:41] something different
[1:30:44] brother johnny what are you doing hey
[1:31:17] i would have enough enough discernment
[1:31:19] you'll know that his attitude his
[1:31:20] discernment
[1:31:21] is only trying to glorify god
[1:31:28] what is the principal theme what is the
[1:31:30] lima principal
[1:31:32] jesus christ jesus christ living amongst
[1:31:35] us
[1:31:37] okay now i i could say something there
[1:31:40] but
[1:31:41] let let's go under the next quorum and
[1:31:42] you bear with me here
[1:31:46] in the spirit see whether it
[1:31:50] is of god or not
[1:31:53] see whether it acts like him
[1:32:07] when you know you're as innocent as you
[1:32:10] can be
[1:32:24] oh my god what is this you remember that
[1:32:28] little benjamite
[1:32:31] kicked up dirt against david patio
[1:32:35] do you remember that david said okay
[1:32:38] leave
[1:32:42] so if somebody kicks up something about
[1:32:44] you accuses you falsely accuses you of
[1:32:49] this i don't want nothing to do with you
[1:32:51] i'm separating myself from
[1:32:53] your serpents
[1:32:58] brother branham says decent amount of
[1:33:00] god allows these things to come on us
[1:33:34] there's people here i personally that
[1:33:36] argue
[1:33:38] uh and uh dis dispute the one monks
[1:33:40] together
[1:33:41] okay well she's like this
[1:33:45] yeah he's like that ellie's a seed
[1:33:48] he's got
[1:34:29] and you just stand there and take it
[1:34:35] now and you know that you've got the
[1:34:39] spirit of god
[1:34:42] i said that australian i'm saying it
[1:34:44] again
[1:35:12] always wanted to separate himself from
[1:35:14] abraham
[1:35:16] even when he went into sodom and
[1:35:17] gomorrah abraham went after him
[1:35:23] no matter what your brother does against
[1:35:24] you important against the contra
[1:35:26] freedom
[1:35:40] oh my god jesus is right mr johnny
[1:35:43] look johnny you did it you did it
[1:35:49] you're gonna pay for this you're gonna
[1:35:50] pay the consequences
[1:35:53] there's no there's no brothers
[1:36:07] the moment they get careless i'll sack
[1:36:09] them
[1:36:14] i'll just look for that one chance to be
[1:36:15] able to kick him as a mule
[1:36:21] we don't think like that huh
[1:36:36] don't try to act mean towards them
[1:36:40] don't curse them now we're following a
[1:36:44] road map here
[1:36:47] we want to follow the word of god
[1:36:50] don't curse them
[1:37:00] you need an altar you need to repent
[1:37:04] of it doesn't make any difference what
[1:37:08] they do to you
[1:37:09] what they do to us don't curse them
[1:37:14] listen to what brother baum says look at
[1:37:16] that look at the steps we have to take
[1:37:18] the road roadmap
[1:37:25] knowing that god did that
[1:37:29] to give you a test to see how you take
[1:37:32] it
[1:37:34] he'll have to come to it anyhow
[1:37:38] see in life life is to school
[1:37:43] and all the time things are coming at us
[1:37:59] god wants to see the image of god in
[1:38:01] your life you're scared of it like
[1:38:03] making the christian soul
[1:38:04] it's like a diamond it's rough it's
[1:38:07] dirty
[1:38:08] it's hospital it's got to be beat
[1:38:13] until it reflects
[1:38:43] he didn't want a fight
[1:38:46] he wanted everybody to be in harmony and
[1:38:48] love each other
[1:38:53] was a man that reflected the spirit of
[1:38:55] christ was brother proud
[1:39:04] and i know that refers to the prophet of
[1:39:06] god and it refers to the church of god
[1:39:17] and i said brother schism is that the
[1:39:21] am i saying that word right schism yeah
[1:39:23] am i saying that brother
[1:39:30] to answer your question i said now i do
[1:39:32] not take either sides with you brother
[1:39:35] la pregunta you know album
[1:39:40] and i know how long
[1:39:43] and i know as long as you fuss
[1:39:48] you're both wrong so if we fight
[1:39:52] to see peliamos
[1:40:07] wow brother johnny you're making it
[1:40:08] really hard on me
[1:40:11] this this is not my plan i've said it
[1:40:15] before now say it again real quick
[1:40:18] when god permitted their whole world to
[1:40:20] fall
[1:40:47] i'll do it on my own i'm not going to
[1:40:48] die for that guy
[1:40:51] but that's the human being that's the
[1:40:52] cardinal
[1:40:55] got god's plan
[1:40:58] that death brings life tried vida then
[1:41:02] he came down himself
[1:41:05] and if you are an attribute of god
[1:41:08] you will have the same characteristics
[1:41:10] as god
[1:41:12] to die to yourself now to answer your
[1:41:16] question
[1:41:18] i do not take either sides with you
[1:41:20] brethren
[1:41:23] and i know as long as you fast
[1:41:28] you're both wrong because i would rather
[1:41:31] be wrong in my
[1:41:32] doc right in my heart
[1:41:37] right in my doctrine
[1:41:40] and wrong in my heart
[1:41:44] i said after all it's your heart's
[1:41:46] condition
[1:41:51] hey man how beautiful that is huh make
[1:41:53] it it's a condition of your heart
[1:41:57] you love everyone
[1:42:11] we try to stay within the word of god
[1:42:15] now now i'm going to insert a little bit
[1:42:18] of doctrine here
[1:42:20] and then when i say this i know some
[1:42:22] people on online
[1:42:24] turn them off now i don't want to hear
[1:42:25] no more i've heard them say
[1:42:39] the message is very extensive
[1:42:43] there's this this this this ex
[1:42:48] but there's certain doctrinal points
[1:42:49] that brother brown said
[1:42:53] that that are more scandalous
[1:42:58] people get all about like uptight or
[1:43:00] freaked out
[1:43:03] oh i don't believe that i don't believe
[1:43:05] that no no
[1:43:06] no okay
[1:43:45] and i've expressed a lot of my thoughts
[1:43:47] yes
[1:43:49] a lot of those people are already gone
[1:43:50] some of them already dead or they left
[1:43:52] the church or they went somewhere else
[1:43:56] and a new group came up so they don't
[1:44:00] really know me
[1:44:02] but a lot of times people judge me but
[1:44:04] what they the the covering of the book
[1:44:09] and i'm going to tell you what i believe
[1:44:12] i believe
[1:44:12] sent a message
[1:44:18] that is my absolute absolute
[1:44:21] messenger
[1:44:26] that's what i believe if i die tomorrow
[1:44:29] it doesn't make any difference i believe
[1:44:32] this message
[1:44:34] it gives us eternal life let's not be
[1:44:36] that it gives us the baptism of the holy
[1:44:38] ghost
[1:44:39] gives you power to overcome but i've
[1:44:42] been saying what you cannot overcome
[1:44:45] because he overcome for you
[1:44:58] do you know him today in the power of
[1:45:00] his resurrection
[1:45:12] see what joshua of this day is going
[1:45:28] reading or hearing the messages
[1:45:32] it's not like reading a newspaper
[1:45:35] you have to read in between the lines
[1:45:38] because it's a love letter to the bride
[1:45:40] of jesus christ
[1:45:56] it was a love
[1:46:10] see what joshua of this day is going to
[1:46:13] be

[1:46:24] and we know brother brown the things he
[1:46:25] said
[1:46:28] of the pillar of fire of the holy ghost
[1:46:35] he used moses to bring him out of the
[1:46:38] world
[1:46:50] he used the great warrior joshua
[1:47:07] but they're also included but the main
[1:47:10] guy
[1:47:11] brother brown said i have been given the
[1:47:13] joshua commission
[1:47:17] brother branham has the joshua
[1:47:20] commissioner
[1:47:33] see what a joshua of a church
[1:47:35] spiritually it's going to be
[1:47:37] josue see how he adds that into that
[1:47:41] right there
[1:47:43] it's the same kind of a joshua
[1:47:46] josue they had in a church
[1:48:16] the believers
[1:48:31] brother is giving us a message here
[1:48:35] as i was with moses
[1:48:39] so will i be with thee joshua josue

[1:48:57] don't hear tapes
[1:49:27] where he belongs on the correspondent
[1:49:29] divided that line exactly
[1:49:32] a very beautiful type today

[1:50:50] god gives one man the the the spirit or
[1:50:54] the gift of
[1:50:56] wisdom

[1:51:21] rock and roll elvis presley
[1:51:23] the rock and roll he was original
[1:51:26] right and now what you got millions
[1:51:31] of copycats
[1:51:53] i think people will respect me more if
[1:51:55] they see that i'm genuine
[1:51:57] sincere
[1:52:41] joseph branham jose branham does not

[1:53:48] to show that you have the evidence of
[1:53:49] the holy ghost

[1:54:34] and i say god sent the seventh angel in
[1:54:36] this age

[1:54:44] that god had not speak in tongues
[1:54:56] i know people that didn't do anything
[1:54:57] and i they're a real genuine christian
[1:55:02] christian
[1:55:15] amen amen
[1:55:44] but god has said in the church
[1:55:52] we want to make them all speaking
[1:55:56] we want to make them all run
[1:56:25] the brother said he saw me
[1:56:38] but you got to believe every word that
[1:56:40] proceeds out of
[1:57:08] separated them by spiritual discernment
[1:57:13] i placed them into the body
[1:57:16] there they remained and became the cream
[1:57:19] of the earth
[1:57:36] spiritual
[1:58:00] you're going to find yourself in the
[1:58:01] woods well how did i end up here
[1:58:04] that's what happened to eve
[1:58:07] he was naked running around the woods oh

[2:08:47] of regression return ministry is only
[2:08:49] part of the message
[2:08:53] if you don't live the life you say
[2:08:56] i can't believe the return ministry
[2:09:00] you ain't gonna call in the rapture
[2:09:31] for the bride el morio he died for the
[2:09:34] foolish virgin he died for the bride
[2:09:38] he died for the fully virgin version
[2:09:44] they have eternal
[2:10:13] the seal of the baptism of the holy
[2:10:14] ghost is that upon the prize
[2:10:20] i know some of you didn't understand
[2:10:21] what i just said
[2:10:24] keep breathing brother keep reading
[2:10:40] attributes of his
[2:10:50] the presence of the holy spirit how many
[2:10:53] believe that
[2:11:36] if a man comes to have a great gift no
[2:11:38] matter
[2:11:39] if he belongs to our denomination or
[2:11:41] another dimension
[2:11:49] don't judge him
[2:12:04] in trouble
[2:12:07] mainly because i speak too much and it's
[2:12:08] time for me to get down
[2:12:12] let's just say for an example we did
[2:12:14] this
[2:12:16] if i did that may god forgive me
[2:12:33] okay fine don't judge him by what
[2:12:36] denomination he come from
[2:12:41] how he dresses but what you want to see
[2:12:45] is what he's trying to do with that gift
[2:12:52] what purpose he has proposed
[2:12:55] if he's trying to take his influence and
[2:12:57] build himself a great name
[2:13:14] no matter how great a teacher he is
[2:13:19] wow and how many of us fall for that
[2:13:23] i have josie i've i've listened to
[2:13:25] preachers in messages
[2:13:28] then
[2:13:41] how powerful he is
[2:13:50] if he isn't trying to achieve something
[2:13:53] for the benefit of the body of christ
[2:14:00] your own spiritual discernment will tell
[2:14:02] you that's wrong
[2:14:08] to that
[2:14:22] don't say you haven't
[2:14:28] but what is his purpose your own
[2:14:31] spiritual name would tell you that's
[2:14:32] wrong
[2:14:36] no matter how accurate
[2:14:47] you could preach a message and even be
[2:14:49] perfect
[2:15:20] you see
[2:15:35] the body of jesus christ
[2:15:40] you're just trying to glorify yourself
[2:15:43] that goes for me first
[2:15:46] you know the word of the sword
[2:16:02] but remember don't forget the angel had
[2:16:05] already eaten the book before john did
[2:16:07] it
[2:16:09] because john represents the bride juan
[2:16:11] represents
[2:16:12] but the seventh angel represents the
[2:16:14] head of the bride
[2:16:30] wow how did i jump to the next code my
[2:16:33] god it's time to get down brother johnny

[2:19:20] as you love those who love you
