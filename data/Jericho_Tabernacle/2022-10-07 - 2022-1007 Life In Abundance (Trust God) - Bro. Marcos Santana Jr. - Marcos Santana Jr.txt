Lord once again I haven't been here in a while as you know I just had a baby and it's been a little difficult this last month and I'm also a little nervous this evening I guess I get so nervous I even forgot my Bible in the back how many are happy to be in the house of the Lord today if you please stand with me and we can jump right into the word and say a quick prayer we're going to turn to John 10 10. yes and people say amen when you all have it John 10 10 Juan the SDS and it really is the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly Lord Heavenly Father we thank you tonight for all that you've done for us up to this point Lord father we ask you take full control of this service may you share some humble words with your children this evening so that we can grow just a little bit more tonight bless everyone here in attendance bless everyone in the invisible audience of the internet it and bless all of our members that are out of town today we place this service in your hands may it all be done for your honoring Glory Gloria in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated Brothers want to thank the pastor in the ministry for the opportunity to be here before you once again I know he's out of town right now but rest assured every time that he's out of town you make sure to watch us the very next day so he is on top of what what is happening once again it feels good to see every one of you once again I haven't I haven't really seen everyone since Camp novice [Music] August was the ninth month of the pregnancy for us and it was a very rough month foreign and it was so awesome how the people that I saw that God delivered you see The Young and the old Belgium just like having those blessings happening to them you're sick they were being healed the slaves they were being free and those doubters that were turning into Believers when I was watching those just from my phone there were so many moments where I just broke down in tears like the atmosphere would just project to me from the phone and if I felt that from my cell phone I can only imagine what every one of you felt being right there in the presence of God at that service so going back to the scripture that we read the scripture says that he has come so that we may have life and and this life what is this life is God's own life it says and have it more abundantly you know and and I don't have a single doubt that there was somebody that left camps Born Again anybody left filled with the Holy Ghost somebody left with God's own life deposited in them and God's life is love God's life is perfect perfect God's life it's Eternal eterno so how can we get more of God's life more abundance the Holy Spirit more abundantly eternity more abundantly if we could compare eternity is like the number infinity or the concept of infinity and science says that there's no number or no quantity within the number infinity so just like God it's never ending science doesn't even know that they know that they're describing that Infinity that they talk about that eternity that they're talking about there's only one that is eternal that is the Lord God Almighty he is the infinite one so to give just a little bit more understanding God gives you the holy ghosts he gives you Faith he gives you godliness and brotherly love and all of this is a part of God it's a part of Eternity it's a part of this Infinity so if I were to have or say I can hold Infinity in my hands and I say brother Luis you know what I'm going to give you a tenth of infinity right now I believe it's uh from one it's point one of infinity well can I give just one tenth of infinity you can't give a fraction because infinity plus infinity is infinity infinity divided by Infinity it's Infinity subtracted Phi Infinity is still Infinity so it will always equal Infinity so to give God give us a fraction of Eternity of his gifts of his Spirit he's giving us all of eternity because the life of God it's Eternal and you've got all of him when he gives it to you but even when he gives it to you since there is no limit and he gave me all of it there's still more to give and there's still more to receive we are still more love together more congratulations because God is eternal he has no limits so when the scripture we read says that he wants to give us life more abundantly to me that is a humongous promise from God because he has no limit to his love there's more to give I'm asking there's more to give in the scripture Philippians 1 6. and I'm certain that God who began the good work within you will continue the work until it is finished foreign in the beginning was a long time ago and then he's the end and even though he's both of those things that still is a time frame is still bigger than the beginning he's greater than the beginning so if we look at a seeds we could say that there's a lot an eternal life in that seat and there's eternal life in the seeds there's eternal life in the trunk in the branches in the leaves and in the fruits and then once again life in the sea universe that was produced in infinite times before que foreign just like someone here tonight they have the potential that seed here tonight has the potential but if we go further than that potential we can tap into that face if you're predestinated you're not a seed a man's seeds you're not a church we're here tonight because we're God see you're not a potential tonight you're a guarantee young people tonight I really want you to believe that yeah I want you to understand that I'm more than potentially a son of God foreign I guarantee probably more than half of you will be the Bible says that we should take the milk of the Gospel at some point in everyone's life in here we were on that bottle drinking that milk and we were getting stronger we're getting wiser who's getting more mature we were growing off that milk but the time came where we grew up and we were no longer babies and it was no longer time for that milk we were gonna get sick and die if all we eat is milk we needed Meats a big juicy steak I'm a barbecue Persona barbecue we ever have some fellowship I'd love to have some barbecues with some big juicy ribs and now if I take my baby girl Hattie you know I can give her right now any kind of food on the planet you can't tell me I can't give it to her if I've grinded up in this make it soft enough she'll eat it up to according to her stature and where she's at in life right now she can't have it yet it's too much for her she can't digest it has been living and walking yes maybe there are some that are still on the bottles but maybe there are some that need to start eating steak but like that stubborn baby it's time for us to grab those blessings and keep walking forward we're talking about the New Birth you just don't got it yet but it's in you Perfection Perfection but it's in you a season where many youth they toss their doubts away a Camp season where they witness Miracles they had a Miracles the Camp season where young people receive the new births were raised people were praising in the voices everywhere and I was he saying it I'm going up yonder to be with my Lord you know how you all looked in that video like the people that believe what they were singing that knew that though they're standing right there in that foreign [Applause] have faith in the experiences that you and it sounded like the Bible to me like when someone encounters Jesus they get in front of his presence and it's so heavy and life changing that you can't help but run and tell somebody like the woman at the well we encounter Jesus we had to run back and tell everybody he went back and tell his friend Philip about it how he got that foot infection and our brother Peter had to take him to the emergency room and to the young people can you imagine what it is that was going through brother Emmanuel's head what kind of thoughts were running through his mind at that moment looking at that feeling those things why do you have to do this why now God what is this a form of punishment for what I did last week where I treated my brother in church the way I treated my kids maybe the way I treated my wife or maybe he was thinking something okay you know maybe I should have been more careful with my health if only I would have watched my diet if only I would have exercised a little bit I would have done this or that you know that that's something that the eyes see what the flesh is the devil trying to get you to think negative plant thoughts of doubt in your heart say it again thoughts of dark doubt in your mind but the spirit in him was saying [Music] you know when everybody was praying for me I knew at that moment I was already healed but brother he get his miracle healing but he got another blessing on that side Domingo his wife or sister she got baptized gave her heart to the Lord so an experience happened at Camp an experience go follow her throughout the week that wouldn't let her go till that Sunday what a knockout punch to the devil that was Lord you did a miracle in my foot but you also did a miracle in my wife you know the devil makes you want to focus on on the circumstances on the hardships that are all around you the things that are right in front of your face you see with these eyes and feel with his body foreign you don't even know the blessing that I got lined up for my son Emmanuel I mean you don't know the blessing right liner for my daughter Hannah you don't know the blessing I have lined up for my son Peter silence my daughter Danielle son daughter because you stood up for me because you walked with me then blessings are coming your way sister where is baptism it wasn't just a blessing for herself it wasn't just for herself and for her four children the greatest gift to a home for two parents to be in one of course be surrender to a living God taking their children you know young people so what do you think goes through brother emanuel's mind now if I could guess I think he's one of the happiest men on the earth to have experienced another experience another experience of Love after love after love you know God heals out of love God Comforts and shows his love and God Saves through life but God also punishes you know young people the devil wants to sell you alive so bad and he tries to sell it to you at all costs and it's going to cost you so much to listen to it then costs you so much to believe it God wants to give you his words he's not trying to trick you into getting it no he's handing it out not like Satan to deceive you like Satan to charge you God wants to give you eternal life for free so young people holding so many blessings are coming even though the circumstance that you're facing right now maybe it's difficult at home maybe it's difficult at school it's difficult maybe you've wrapped yourself up in so many things right now that you can't find the exit to come back foreign because he he healed brother Emmanuel's foot that's why he serves him because uh he healed me of my my sickness from a year ago that's why I serve him no we serve him because he loved us because he died for us he gave himself on the cross so that we might have eternal life before we could even give love answers he was already loving us and he wants to give us more love and give it an abundance peace give of his own life more abundance you know if you like to turn the second second Samuel chapter 22. and and down to verse 31 we're going to look at David here everybody knows the story of David but there's a lot of fine details within the story of David there's a lot to read about David let's just take this small portion here in verse 31 it says God's way is perfect all the Lord's promises prove true he is a shield for all who look to him for protection God's way is perfect not my way David was was an outstanding man he was a a a tremendous Warriors but he had the Revelation to say God's way is perfect verse 33 verse God is my strong Fortress and he makes my way perfect he makes my way perfect effect because I can't make my way Perfecto 35 says he trains my hands excuse me he trains my hands for battle he strengthens my arm to draw bronze Bowl 36. you have given me your Shield of Victory your help has made me great verse 40. you have armed me with strength for battle and you have subdued my enemies under my feet do you notice a trend in there young people something that kept happening kept being said over and over David never said I am the strongest I am the wisest your soil massager I by my abilities I fight foreign I'm gonna walk out of there Victoria and you know you young people you went to Camp foreign and he's going to walk you back out Victoria just trusting God like David and through God you will win every battle in your life but sometimes these battles these wars they're all different you know some require guns others required swords some needed planes some needed tanks some Wars and battles when it came down to it it was just some good old fist to fist combat but trust the Lord and some battles today in your life are going to require more praise a lot more praying than you think you do I don't want to tell you you need to pray a hundred times a day all right okay but I'll say it like this if you can at least start praying once a day but give God a genuine prayer with all your hearts that is the more prayer that he wants not the quantity but the quality of the prayer and relationship you're trying to give him some battles they're going to require fasting you know one of the greatest battles I ever fought I'll never forget that so they require more reading of the words some battles are going to require you to push play a little bit more [Music] this one might hurt some of you rebellious youths some of you rebellious older folks but some battles in order for you to win are going to require obedience and sacrifice but I think the strongest one of them all some battles and trust in God are going to require you to just be still and let God be God behind the scenes but after seeing those Services I know there are young people here members here they took that theme to heart you walked with God so therefore you're going to mature from that battle you had you know brother Brandon talks about the three Hebrew children how they went into that furnace and how everyone when they went in they saw that there was a fourth person we know brother Brando says that that was none other than Jesus Christ now just to read quickly in the message the reaction to an attack two in action says isn't it strange how God does things he'll let us get right down to the very last mile he likes to do that he did it with the Hebrew children knew who he could trust he knows that he can trust in you so he let them boys walk right up to that fiery furnace where they could almost smell the fire but he never moved he will move but I'm sorry but but when it comes time he will move he will move but he waits till his own time he wanted to see what kind of reaction that they would have he knew that they had made their stands they had made their stands those three they walked with God they were young they walked with God in the trials they were still walking with God up to their sentence Death By Flames to burn line ashes in that furnace but they still walked with God and because they walked with God God walked with them they stood for him he stood for them and because he walked in with them he made sure that he'd walk out with them no burn marks no ashes no smell of smoke on that body and tonight I'm looking at a group of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego because y'all walk to that furnace on that camera that was a hard camp for you a Deliverance of healing of people being born again of people being healed of traumas but I don't see a trace of smoke on any one of you tonight and you know there's only one way to God and we know that is through our Lord Jesus Christ young people we've heard it over and over and over again but that ain't never gonna change because he's the same yesterday today boy you know it young people and tomorrow so it ain't gonna change Jesus Christ is the way the truth and the life and the sooner we can accept that is the sooner we can walk more with God instead of wanting to make our own way to find our own truth to do our own lives you know Jesus will never walk away from you it's us is walking away from Jesus he's the chief Shepherd you won't lose any that have fallen in his hands you know you go astray he puts everything on pause you know that Shepherd didn't say let me go take these 99 and pin them up real quick let me feed them and do my errands with them real quick because I've got a long busy day today he said no I'm going to pin them up right here right now because one of my sons one of my daughters is lost my sheep has gone astray you know I find it amazing because I believe our young people here are trying to serve the Lord some of them are have been serving the lord so you're not someone from the world coming in but you should identify with this more than anybody because being young is difficult and we do go straight but a God Almighty loves us so much there's a pastor that cares for us you go straight he's going to go out there to bring you back why okay because you're already his foreign to just walk with God why do I need to walk how do I walk who am I walking with who is God when I walk with god what happens there's so much within just walking with God read another another quote real quick from the message what what is that in the hand says uh he uh talking about David again this is David saying here says look here I'm going to tell you something I've had some experience and that's what it takes today brother Brown says it takes an experience today then David said I was keeping my father's sheep out there and a lion come in and a bird come in and they grab that little lamb and they run out with it and then I run after him and knock him on his head with this slingshot and it started to take the lamb out of its mouth but then it rolls up but then I slew him said that God that delivered the lion into my hands and that bear into my hands how much more will he deliver that uncircumcised Philistines you know David was just a teenage boy like a lot of the youth here but his experiences they taught him how to trust more in God it took killing a lion which isn't some small docile animals and mostly that experience helped him to kill a eight foot bear essay experience but then killing that bear gave him the experience he needed the trust that he needed to be able to kill that 15 foot I don't know how tall Goliath was and gave him more trust in the Lord for the battles to come for the wars to come but brother Marcos I don't know how to fight I've never been in a battle before you fight just to open your Bible you fight just to push play you fought just to get to church tonight because your eyes and your flesh the whole world that's around you sometimes friends sometimes families familiares is fighting against you because it doesn't want you to come to church and hear the words so it sounds like you do have a huge battle you go through every single day you know we're coming to an end I know we've all heard somebody we might have even been that somebody that says you know I if I wish I just had brother luis's testimony you know just the way he came to the Lord you know he didn't step out into the world God used him since his youth you know I tainted my life and I did this and that made me testimonials you know I've only had a testimony like sister Santos you know the life that she live how God called her and having experience like her because we hear these tremendous testimonies how people were saved and converted and they received their new birds and you know young people you know you might look at the minister right now you see the pastor as he comes in and out you see our amazing Elders every Sunday and you see how consecrated they are you see how firm they are you see how much trust they have in this world but you know what it took to get there behind the scenes was much more than what you see today you say I want to be like this person like that person but the stature they're at today the maturity that they're in today was because of every single battle they had in their life that was Battle after battle after battle you know you can't buy 50 years of experience over here at Food City you know you can't just go to a grocery store and say I want uh 25 years of experience you can't call the pastor and say you know what pastor Pastor I just sold my house and everything I've got yeah you know I I want I want to buy the the seven statues of a perfect man from you I want to buy my new Birds I want to buy that adoption no you can't purchase those things it's gonna take a season after a season and there's going to be battles after battles and you're going to grow from stature you know I heard brother Ryan the minister from Sunday Ryan and it hit me and made me pause the video and I don't know sometimes it's simple things they hit me so hard because maybe it's because I'm so dumb I don't read I can't understand but brother Ryan said in on Sunday he said how can you trust in God I don't know if anybody remembers what I'm about to say how can you trust in a God that you don't pray too it got me I had to push pause I said well he's going to be God whether we pray to him or not he's going to be God whether we pretend that he's ours or not but how can we trust him if we don't have a relationship if we don't talk to him if we're not in love with him if we haven't had intimacy so how can you young person how can you trust in a God that you don't walk with I wanted to walk with that in order for you to trust that God if you could please stand we're going to be closing the musicians that come forward and play something Softly foreigners well to actually everybody you know you're still standing here tonight you're still trusting God tonight you trusted to repent and you've won that battle you trusted to be healed and you won that battle you trusted to receive the new birth and it was you that won that battle but the fight isn't over Camp was a battle all of September had its battles tonight is another battle for you but God has given you life and how did but some young people are listening right now and other young people will listen to this later and it was you that received something from that campaign so hold on to it and just believe it because that was your blessing that was your Miracles it was all for you but prepare yourself for the blessing that is going to come next again because I'm looking at you here tonight and you're not dead yet you're not raptured yet I see you with my own eyes so since you're here tonight you're still in that race you're still running that race you're in this fight you're still gonna be fighting but one day but only we all can say you can say young people can say with the conviction and a revelation that I fought the good fight I fought battle after battle after battle but I finally finished my race and the most beautiful part in the scriptures [Music] I have trusted in the Lord I've walked with God close your eyes hear the words of brother Branham and you're here to fulfill it too just walk with unconsciousness of fear walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious unto the world as you walk in Christ walk with him not paying attention to the right or the left hand but to just keep moving on if something comes up in church just walk with God hallelujah hallelujah if sickness strikes walk with God if your neighbor don't like you just walk with God you just keep on Walking with God the doctor say you're going to die and he would confirm it to you so just walk with God you're gonna have your ups and downs to us but don't worry you've got to go through the hillsides and the mountains in the waters walk with God lord Jesus tonight oh God we have been walking with you Lord we have done miracles from
