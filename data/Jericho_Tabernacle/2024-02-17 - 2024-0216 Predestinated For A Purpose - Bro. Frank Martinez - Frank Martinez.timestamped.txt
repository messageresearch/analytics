[43:51] father your Prophet said you know the
[43:54] motives of our hearts
[43:58] you know the reason that we're
[44:01] here and the only purpose
[44:04] Lord is to help your
[44:07] people that something would be
[44:10] said that would help someone
[44:14] tonight father we just
[44:16] pray that you would take
[44:19] control lord of the
[44:22] speaker The
[44:24] Interpreter and of the hearer of your
[44:27] word father we we we
[44:30] believe Lord that you can set our Our
[44:33] Hearts on
[44:36] Fire I believe that we've come
[44:40] tonight and trust you with all that's in
[44:43] our
[44:45] hearts we believe that you can still
[44:47] speak to our
[44:50] hearts father let this not be just
[44:53] another
[44:54] service but when we leave here
[44:59] tonight oh Lord may we truly

[45:11] way Lord come and visit us

[45:48] amen God bless you you may be
[45:53] seated amen amen now
[45:57] tonight if the Lord would help
[46:00] us I would like to take a little
[46:04] thought I would like to speak
[46:06] predestinated for a
[46:10] purpose and my only hope
[46:15] tonight is that we've come here to help
[46:20] someone you know we all need help in one
[46:23] way or
[46:24] another
[46:26] but I believe that the only one that can
[46:28] help
[46:30] us is the one that we've trusted
[46:34] in and so I pray
[46:37] tonight that if God only speaks to one
[46:41] heart I believe then we've done the will
[46:44] of
[46:45] God you know Jesus one time crossed the
[46:49] sea to get to someone that was in
[46:54] need and I believe to
[46:56] tonight if God before the foundations of
[46:59] the
[47:01] world Brothers I believe this meeting
[47:04] here
[47:05] tonight wasn't thought of it the day I
[47:08] was
[47:10] invited but I believe that this meeting
[47:12] here
[47:13] [Applause]
[47:14] tonight was in the mind of God before
[47:17] the foundations of the
[47:20] world I believe that with all that's in
[47:24] my heart I believe that we have a god
[47:28] tonight that is so
[47:31] real that if you would only believe with
[47:33] all that's in your
[47:35] heart you would truly
[47:38] understand that me and you have been
[47:42] predestinated for a purpose as long as
[47:45] we are on this
[47:48] Earth and that's what we want to speak
[47:50] on
[47:51] tonight and I believe that God will help
[47:54] us
[47:56] in every prayer line that brother
[47:58] brandom
[48:00] had and when those people would come
[48:04] up he would say Do you believe with all
[48:07] that's in your
[48:09] heart and the same thing
[48:13] tonight we've got to believe with all
[48:15] that's in our
[48:17] hearts that God is in his
[48:21] word and brother brandom
[48:23] said God is revealed through his
[48:27] word I believe that
[48:31] now I want to take another
[48:34] scripture over in second
[48:39] Peter chapter 1 and verse
[48:42] 12 now that
[48:45] first
[48:47] scripture is what we titled
[48:51] it predestinated for a
[48:54] purpose remember that this purpose does
[48:57] not
[48:59] depend on anything that's already been
[49:04] predestinated now
[49:05] notice and here in second
[49:09] Peter in verse
[49:15] 12 notice what the Apostle
[49:20] Peter is telling the church in that
[49:24] day
[49:26] notice that all these things are
[49:31] types all these things are
[49:37] shadows in verse
[49:40] 12 Peter tells us wherefore I was not
[49:44] negligent to put you always in
[49:47] remembrance of these
[49:51] things am amen amen brothers and sisters
[49:56] if it wasn't important there's no need
[49:58] to remember
[50:00] it but if it was important for Peter is
[50:03] important for
[50:06] us many
[50:08] times when you remember
[50:11] something it's because something that
[50:13] you've left in the
[50:15] past Brothers maybe there are some
[50:18] things that we have
[50:21] forgotten but may God bring those things
[50:24] to our remembrance
[50:28] and the Bible tells
[50:30] us always in remembrance of these things
[50:36] notice though you know them and being
[50:39] established in present
[50:43] truth in other words he wasn't speaking
[50:47] just to
[50:49] anyone he was speaking to a people that
[50:52] had been established in the message of
[50:54] that hour
[50:58] these were the people that need to be
[50:59] brought back into
[51:03] remembrance and tonight I'm here to tell
[51:06] you this message is for a
[51:10] people is for a people as Peter
[51:13] said that has been established in
[51:16] present
[51:18] truth and I don't know about you but I
[51:21] believe we have been established in
[51:23] present truth
[51:26] God sent an
[51:28] angel Revelations
[51:31] 107 amen he sent an angel to reveal all
[51:36] the
[51:37] Mysteries and I believe that that
[51:40] angel was
[51:42] given this great book of
[51:46] redemption to call out the
[51:49] names of those that God had
[51:53] predestinated to be in present truth
[51:57] tonight but
[52:00] remember we've got to remember these
[52:03] things we can't let them
[52:05] forget let's not forget these
[52:08] things these can I take my coat
[52:12] off I'm feeling a little bit of
[52:18] Pentecost now
[52:20] notice now notice
[52:23] here so I just want you to
[52:26] see what kind of people Peter was
[52:28] talking
[52:31] about amen people established in present
[52:37] truth now in verse
[52:39] 13 I want you to
[52:43] notice yeah I think it meet that as long
[52:46] as I am in this
[52:50] Tabernacle to stir you up by putting you
[52:53] in remembrance
[52:57] brothers and
[52:58] sisters when Peter uses the word
[53:05] stir that means that something has
[53:09] settled amen amen something that used to
[53:14] move something that was
[53:17] flexible something has happened to it
[53:19] now has
[53:22] settled but Peter came to stir that
[53:28] a
[53:29] time that me and you need stiring this
[53:34] now could be brothers and
[53:36] sisters that our lives have
[53:39] settled we become good church
[53:43] members oh
[53:45] Brothers now we have a custom of coming
[53:47] to church on
[53:51] Sundays come on brother Frank preach
[53:54] it amen amen now now we got a
[53:58] routine Brothers but Peter wanted to
[54:00] break that
[54:03] routine to get to a
[54:06] place when we come to
[54:08] church that we want to hear from
[54:12] God Amen not just to come and hear a
[54:15] good
[54:16] sermon but say God send me a Revival
[54:22] tonight if you don't send anybody El
[54:24] send the to
[54:27] me to
[54:29] stir these things that we have
[54:32] forgotten to bring us
[54:35] back Brothers I'll tell you what for the
[54:38] last several
[54:40] days the wife and I have been
[54:44] sitting
[54:45] hearing the every message that brother
[54:48] Brandon prayed in the Chicago
[54:53] meetings you know how I
[54:56] long to see those things back in our
[55:00] churches amen amen to hear a
[55:04] prophet that these things can be
[55:07] done if we were only
[55:10] believe all that's in our
[55:15] hearts now notice I hope I'm not hurting
[55:21] anybody but it's Peter that says I need
[55:23] to stir you
[55:26] don't forget these
[55:28] things when we come to church when we
[55:31] worship God Brothers Let's do what all
[55:34] that's in our
[55:36] hearts if we're going to come to
[55:38] church you don't
[55:40] for brothers don't get mad don't get mad

[55:46] Frank because the word Frank means just
[55:49] to be
[55:51] honest and I'm here to tell you
[55:54] Brothers
[55:55] honesty brothers and sisters that we
[55:59] can't let these things settle in our
[56:03] lives amen amen the reason that we need
[56:07] to come to church every
[56:10] day every time we have
[56:12] service is to come and meet
[56:16] God amen amen brothers and sisters not
[56:20] just to have a good
[56:22] time I can have a good time not
[56:27] basketball I can have a good time doing
[56:29] things that don't pertain to
[56:31] God oh brothers that's not the way we
[56:34] come to
[56:36] church when we come to church let's get
[56:39] ready to receive
[56:42] something and you excuse me if I ain't
[56:46] going to be ready to receive something I
[56:48] ain't coming to
[56:51] church if I'm going to the doctor I'm
[56:54] going there so he can help
[56:56] me amen because if I can't believe he's
[56:59] going to help me then why go
[57:02] over if I'm coming to church I've got to
[57:06] know something's going to help
[57:09] me amen amen that's that that's all
[57:13] right ain't it

[57:30] home and I watch this now notice this
[57:35] Brothers I'm not doing this cuz I'm here
[57:37] this is the why I preach
[57:40] everywhere now watch this you know why
[57:44] cuz if I can get
[57:46] excited when the devil used to get me
[57:49] excited how much more and I going to get
[57:53] excited you know brother sister the
[57:55] devil used to get you
[57:57] excited and you weren't
[58:00] embarrassed you weren't
[58:02] embarrassed why should I be embarrassed
[58:04] to get excited
[58:10] to now now watch this so Peter tells
[58:16] us he tells us in in verse
[58:19] 13 to stir you up by putting you in
[58:23] remembrance amen amen now verse
[58:27] 14 watch here
[58:29] Brothers knowing that
[58:33] shortly I must put off this my
[58:36] Tabernacle even as our Lord Jesus Christ
[58:39] has showed
[58:43] me we understand that Peter knew that he
[58:47] was at the end of his
[58:51] journey and Peter wanted to make sure
[58:55] that those people truly
[58:59] understood and to never
[59:03] forget the teachings that were taught to
[59:07] them now watch here in verse
[59:10] 15 moreover I will endeavor that you may
[59:14] be able after my decease to have these
[59:19] things always in
[59:23] remembrance
[59:27] when I was reading
[59:29] this it was almost like my mind was
[59:32] going back into the very words of our
[59:37] Prophet always telling us just say what
[59:40] I
[59:42] said do you still believe that
[59:45] tonight Brothers I'm not saying
[59:47] something different I'm saying what he
[59:51] said and now remember brother Peter says
[59:55] After I'm
[1:00:00] Gone Amen to have these things always in
[1:00:04] your
[1:00:07] remembrance brother Brandon put it this
[1:00:11] way he said long after I am
[1:00:16] gone these Tes will be
[1:00:19] played do you know why so we would not
[1:00:23] forget
[1:00:25] our
[1:00:26] position our
[1:00:28] purpose here in this life and brothers
[1:00:31] and
[1:00:32] sisters sometimes I
[1:00:34] wonder whether we have forgotten who we
[1:00:38] are brothers we are not part of a
[1:00:42] church we are not part of
[1:00:46] brick wood we are part of the kingdom of
[1:00:51] God amen Amen brother
[1:00:55] our beginning was not
[1:00:58] here you may love your
[1:01:01] church and you may also say I remember
[1:01:04] the anniversary when I gave my life to
[1:01:08] God brother Brom said that's the day you
[1:01:11] recognized
[1:01:13] it but as for you your
[1:01:17] birth way before the foundations of the
[1:01:20] world of
[1:01:23] God these are the things that brother
[1:01:25] random taught
[1:01:27] us and these are the things that need be
[1:01:31] stirred not only in the
[1:01:34] old but also in the
[1:01:37] new and many times the reason that we're
[1:01:40] having
[1:01:42] trouble with the young people is because
[1:01:47] they need the same experience that the
[1:01:48] old people
[1:01:50] had amen
[1:01:53] amen but you know what has
[1:01:55] happened you know what has happened
[1:01:58] brothers and sisters I can only tell you
[1:02:00] what's in my
[1:02:01] heart you know what has happened our
[1:02:05] young people are bound by rules and
[1:02:06] regulations at
[1:02:11] home this is what you're going to do
[1:02:13] this is what you're going to do this is
[1:02:14] what you're going to
[1:02:16] do we as parents might not like to hear
[1:02:19] but somebody better tell
[1:02:22] us you will not this you will not do
[1:02:25] this you will not do
[1:02:29] that we've got a bunch of rules and
[1:02:33] regulations even though they're good
[1:02:34] it's not going to change
[1:02:37] them let me tell you something you can
[1:02:41] get a
[1:02:42] man you can lock him up in
[1:02:46] prison he he when he was out here he was
[1:02:48] a drug
[1:02:50] addict he's in there he's
[1:02:53] clean
[1:02:55] he lives
[1:02:57] right but there's nothing in there to
[1:02:59] change
[1:03:01] him the only thing that's changing him
[1:03:03] is the rules and regulations of that
[1:03:08] prison but as soon as he gets
[1:03:11] out in a matter of months he's back in
[1:03:14] jail
[1:03:16] again and as long Brothers our children
[1:03:20] under rules and
[1:03:23] regulations once they get old they're
[1:03:25] going to
[1:03:26] leave so you know what you need to do
[1:03:29] and I need to
[1:03:31] do and this might hurt you but you say
[1:03:34] we got to get them to the message no you
[1:03:36] got to get them to
[1:03:40] Christ before you bring him to the
[1:03:42] message get him to Jesus
[1:03:45] Christ he'll change your heart to
[1:03:48] believe this
[1:03:50] message that's what we need talk to them
[1:03:54] about the love of
[1:04:03] God is that
[1:04:05] right that's the truth Brothers amen
[1:04:09] amen I want you to notice
[1:04:10] something we've got to a place I've used
[1:04:14] this example many
[1:04:15] times but I know many of you have not
[1:04:17] heard
[1:04:19] it but Brothers we have been
[1:04:20] predestinated with a
[1:04:23] purpose we have to truly understand who
[1:04:25] we
[1:04:27] are amen remember we are the sons of the
[1:04:29] Living
[1:04:31] God but you know what has
[1:04:33] happened over time we have forgotten
[1:04:37] about these
[1:04:39] things but Brothers as there was ever a
[1:04:42] time we know when we know who we are
[1:04:44] it's
[1:04:45] now without a shadow of doubt we know
[1:04:48] who we
[1:04:50] are years ago when a man wanted to
[1:04:54] recognize who he was there was no
[1:04:57] way you know what he would do he would
[1:05:00] kneel down and he would look at the
[1:05:03] water and he could
[1:05:06] see a
[1:05:08] reflection but it wasn't clear who he
[1:05:11] was they had an
[1:05:13] excuse and then over
[1:05:16] time they invented the
[1:05:18] metal you could polish
[1:05:21] it now you could see yourself a little
[1:05:23] clear
[1:05:26] amen you could see yourself but you
[1:05:28] couldn't see all your
[1:05:31] defects
[1:05:32] amen and
[1:05:34] then what somebody
[1:05:36] did they invented
[1:05:40] glass and you could see
[1:05:42] yourself amen you could see the defects
[1:05:46] on the outside but not on the
[1:05:50] inside is that right but then
[1:05:54] the greatest thing
[1:05:56] came the Bible says the mirror of God's
[1:06:00] word in the mirror of God's word just
[1:06:03] didn't look on the outside it looked on
[1:06:05] the
[1:06:07] inside truly would know who we
[1:06:11] are that's why this word
[1:06:13] tonight can penetrate deep down inside
[1:06:16] your
[1:06:17] heart it will stir you to ask God what
[1:06:23] you're telling me tonight that is the
[1:06:25] truth I need a Revival in my
[1:06:29] heart I'm not the one that said it but I
[1:06:32] believe it brother random said we're
[1:06:35] dying in our
[1:06:39] [Music]
[1:06:42] church that's
[1:06:44] true it's
[1:06:46] because we have been predestinated with
[1:06:48] a
[1:06:50] purpose but the devil has made
[1:06:53] sure that you forget what that purpose
[1:06:56] was he'll he'll put all kinds of things
[1:06:59] in your
[1:07:00] life he he'll make things happen in your
[1:07:04] life to try to discourage
[1:07:07] you he'll he he he'll he'll permit
[1:07:10] something that will come into your life
[1:07:11] that will tear your heart
[1:07:15] apart he he he'll he'll He he'll make
[1:07:17] something
[1:07:19] happened to a place where you start you
[1:07:22] start denying
[1:07:24] and get to a
[1:07:27] place
[1:07:30] brothers that you almost say I don't
[1:07:32] believe this
[1:07:36] message brother brandham said don't
[1:07:39] Ender don't never underestimate the
[1:07:43] devil he'll get you one way or he'll get
[1:07:46] you another
[1:07:48] way don't never underestimate
[1:07:51] you and brother randam also said
[1:07:54] if the devil cannot get you to
[1:07:58] disbelief what you believe he'll take
[1:08:01] you to one extreme or the
[1:08:06] other brothers that Devil's been around
[1:08:10] here a long
[1:08:12] time and he's caused many of us to lose
[1:08:16] focus we just don't say
[1:08:19] anything none of us want to say
[1:08:22] anything Brothers none of want nobody
[1:08:24] wants to come to the
[1:08:25] altar because we're embarrassed that
[1:08:27] mama's going to say well I thought you
[1:08:29] were serving
[1:08:32] God I'm telling you
[1:08:34] something I have preached a lot of
[1:08:37] funerals I tell you one thing there's
[1:08:40] nothing as glorious as to preach a
[1:08:43] funeral for a Son of
[1:08:46] God that make things right was ashame of
[1:08:50] who saw
[1:08:52] him Amen brother I'm only trying to help
[1:08:56] you now
[1:08:59] notice on a message gowake
[1:09:06] Jesus preacher 1963 paragraph
[1:09:11] 8 Brothers brother bam says now I've
[1:09:16] always thought the church wasn't
[1:09:17] halfhazard
[1:09:21] you know what that means when something
[1:09:24] is halfhazard it's
[1:09:28] disorganized It's Always by
[1:09:31] chance and this is where that word comes
[1:09:33] is just
[1:09:35] chance no brothers we're not here by
[1:09:38] chance we're here because we have a
[1:09:41] purpose and brother brandom tells us
[1:09:44] amen that the church isn't halfhazard
[1:09:49] amen you have to know who you are and
[1:09:51] where you
[1:09:52] stand

[1:09:57] Earth have
[1:10:00] Hazard he never died in a halfhazard
[1:10:04] way he come for a
[1:10:07] purpose and that purpose was to fulfill
[1:10:09] the Commandment of
[1:10:12] God that he might purchase to himself a
[1:10:14] church without spot or
[1:10:19] wrinkle so Jesus had a
[1:10:22] purpose he just didn't come for you to
[1:10:25] feel sorry for him that's what brother
[1:10:26] brandham
[1:10:29] said amen he just didn't come to see if
[1:10:32] it would
[1:10:33] work no when God does things he doesn't
[1:10:39] perfect and I'm here to tell you it
[1:10:42] doesn't even depend on
[1:10:44] you it depends on God's
[1:10:48] choosing and I'm going to prove to you
[1:10:51] tonight you still believe the message
[1:10:53] right
[1:10:54] right so I'm not going to take what a
[1:10:56] man
[1:10:58] says I'm going to take what God Said
[1:11:00] through this
[1:11:02] prophet he said it like brother Billy
[1:11:06] Paul used to
[1:11:07] say he said it I believe it and that
[1:11:13] sett and walk out of here
[1:11:16] tonight with a different step in
[1:11:21] my I don't want to come in
[1:11:24] and leave the same
[1:11:26] way you don't have
[1:11:28] to this Friday night can be the turning
[1:11:31] point in your
[1:11:34] life notice here we have to believe that
[1:11:39] we've got to preach a message it's got
[1:11:43] power power enough to change me and
[1:11:47] you say again power enough to change me
[1:11:50] and
[1:11:52] you
[1:11:54] now are you ready for the rest of
[1:11:57] it when you leave here when you leave
[1:12:01] here Brothers you can repeat these
[1:12:04] things to the
[1:12:07] devil amen
[1:12:12] Amen on the message I know my redeemer
[1:12:17] liveth brother brandom said in in this
[1:12:20] message preaching 58 paragraph

[1:12:27] attention because these things will help
[1:12:30] us I'm just here to help
[1:12:33] you Amen to walk a little
[1:12:36] closer amen now watch
[1:12:39] this watch what he
[1:12:41] says and God did not make
[1:12:44] you and I just to see if he could do
[1:12:50] it God just didn't say Okay I want to
[1:12:52] see if this will work
[1:12:55] God is not like me and you that take
[1:13:00] chances amen you know you take a pill
[1:13:03] say I'm going to see if this is
[1:13:09] works we go through

[1:13:49] come by
[1:13:51] coincidence amen God brought you you
[1:13:53] here for a
[1:13:55] purpose do you know if God didn't want
[1:13:57] you here he could have made something
[1:13:58] happen so you wouldn't
[1:14:01] come let me say this
[1:14:04] also there's people from this church
[1:14:06] that ain't here
[1:14:08] tonight but you're here you're here why
[1:14:13] because God ordained you to be here and
[1:14:15] ordained them not to be
[1:14:20] here that's the truth that's why we're
[1:14:25] now watch what he
[1:14:26] says he says he said you're not just
[1:14:30] here to be another human being oh
[1:14:34] my in other words we're not here just

[1:15:24] you're not here just to live in that
[1:15:27] house but doesn't it seem that that the
[1:15:30] routine of everyday life kind of puts us
[1:15:32] in that
[1:15:35] situation from home to work to go buy
[1:15:38] groceries to come

[1:19:00] things and you know what he almost had
[1:19:03] me
[1:19:05] convinced but at my darkest hour he came

[1:19:11] scene Jesus came on the
[1:19:13] scene said your heart isn't
[1:19:16] hardened but what you are
[1:19:20] experiencing it's a piece that passes

[1:20:03] me amen amen and you know what
[1:20:06] happened I told God I said Lord I didn't

[1:20:35] this and I hope you believe it with all
[1:20:37] in your
[1:20:39] heart brother brandom says that if we
[1:20:41] are here for a
[1:20:44] purpose then there is
[1:20:46] nothing you know what nothing is nothing
[1:20:50] can destroy us

[1:25:03] Life preached in
[1:25:06] 1956 paragraph
[1:25:10] 153 I hope you're believing this not
[1:25:13] because I'm saying it but because
[1:25:14] brother brandom said
[1:25:16] it and I don't care what the what the
[1:25:18] people on YouTube
[1:25:21] say I want to stay with this Prophet
[1:25:23] till the day I
[1:25:25] die I'm too old to
[1:25:28] change and there's one
[1:25:30] thing that that God has proven in my
[1:25:33] life it's not you that got a hold of God
[1:25:36] it's God got a hold of
[1:25:39] you because many times God honors your
[1:25:44] sincerity don't ever tell me whether
[1:25:47] you're a preacher you're a
[1:25:50] deacon amen you're just a church member
[1:25:54] don't ever tell me that at one time of
[1:25:56] your life you wanted to give
[1:26:00] up because you're looking at somebody
[1:26:02] that has wanted to give up many
[1:26:05] times amen but you
[1:26:08] know he said you're not a holding you're
[1:26:11] you're not holding on to
[1:26:13] yourself he said I'm holding on to
[1:26:16] you and you ain't going to let go I say
[1:26:20] you ain't going to let go
[1:26:23] amen amen you
[1:26:26] know you know you know you know you know
[1:26:29] sometimes sometimes you know I'm
[1:26:32] thinking but I don't say
[1:26:33] anything I don't even say these things
[1:26:35] to my
[1:26:36] wife but God is real and so and so you
[1:26:40] know I'm trying to make an
[1:26:41] excuse I'm getting older my knees are
[1:26:44] getting wore
[1:26:46] out and I start figuring out this in my
[1:26:49] mind say you know what I'm going to
[1:26:51] retire
[1:26:53] I want to retire you know I came into
[1:26:55] the message almost 40 years
[1:26:59] ago I try to justify
[1:27:02] myself I've been in this message a long
[1:27:05] time and I'm getting older so I'm want
[1:27:07] to
[1:27:08] retire so you know what amen I step up
[1:27:12] to the pulit and before I go to the
[1:27:16] pit you know I feel like a balloon and
[1:27:18] then God
[1:27:21] goes
[1:27:23] brother random says says ministers don't
[1:27:30] retire he said ministers don't
[1:27:33] retire you know what I did I said scrap
[1:27:37] that
[1:27:40] plant amen now watch this brother Brom
[1:27:44] says on this
[1:27:45] message he says he makes no
[1:27:50] mistakes you might think that you're a
[1:27:53] mistake but God makes no
[1:27:56] mistakes I believe this Prophet was a
[1:27:58] voice of God to me and
[1:28:01] you it was God telling you he never made
[1:28:04] a mistake when he chose
[1:28:08] you
[1:28:10] watch brothers are you ready are you
[1:28:12] ready for
[1:28:13] this he makes no
[1:28:15] mistakes so next time the devil tells
[1:28:18] you something God makes no
[1:28:21] mistakes God didn't make a
[1:28:23] mistake watch what he
[1:28:26] says he he wouldn't bring you
[1:28:30] in are you
[1:28:32] ready if you wasn't
[1:28:36] worthy sometimes we we walk with our
[1:28:38] head down like
[1:28:40] this oh Lord I'm not
[1:28:42] worthy he just told you you were
[1:28:46] worthy from now on I am

[1:28:53] purpose to
[1:28:56] recognize that I am a Son of God and he
[1:29:00] told me I am
[1:29:05] [Music]
[1:29:07] worthy and the prophet of God says and
[1:29:10] he knows your
[1:29:12] heart that's right he knows what you
[1:29:17] are he knows all about
[1:29:20] you still calls you

[1:29:30] motives amen and you're still
[1:29:36] worthy
[1:29:39] my there are traps all along the
[1:29:43] road sure the devil will cause you to
[1:29:48] stumble and you say I didn't mean to do
[1:29:50] that
[1:29:53] God you know
[1:29:54] it brother brandom said but you're still
[1:29:59] perfect the human mind cannot understand
[1:30:03] that but you know it's not you it's
[1:30:07] him it's him tonight when you
[1:30:10] leave Brothers don't look in the in in
[1:30:13] the
[1:30:14] mirror in the natural mirror look at
[1:30:17] God's
[1:30:18] word this message was revealed to us
[1:30:22] by a prophet that came to tell a people
[1:30:27] that you are perfect and you are
[1:30:30] worthy and that God would have never
[1:30:32] called
[1:30:33] you if you weren't
[1:30:36] worthy amen amen notice
[1:30:40] here he says because there's a perfect
[1:30:43] blood offered for you every
[1:30:48] day and a bleeding sacrifice hanging
[1:30:50] Before the Throne of Almighty
[1:30:56] God that's right now how did you get in
[1:31:00] there God by forn
[1:31:03] knowledge you didn't get in this church
[1:31:06] because somebody called you you got in
[1:31:07] here because it was the will of
[1:31:11] God it was the will of
[1:31:13] God
[1:31:16] amen amen
[1:31:20] amen
[1:31:22] on the message Victory
[1:31:26] Day preacher 1963 paragraph
[1:31:32] 177 don't you just love the
[1:31:35] message we're supposed to identify with
[1:31:41] it so along went
[1:31:44] Abraham and he finally
[1:31:48] come he said then you see being so loyal
[1:31:52] he said Abraham was so
[1:31:57] loyal he says more
[1:32:00] loyal more
[1:32:05] testings so if you don't want testing
[1:32:09] stay
[1:32:12] home but the more loyal you are the more
[1:32:16] testing you're going
[1:32:19] get see the devil won't tell you that
[1:32:23] he'll always tell you that you're doing
[1:32:25] something wrong but God through this
[1:32:28] Prophet told us the more loyal you are
[1:32:31] the more testings you're going to
[1:32:35] get we're here for a
[1:32:38] purpose that you may know who you are
[1:32:41] tonight you're here for a specific
[1:32:44] reason but until you
[1:32:46] know what God thinks about you you never
[1:32:50] come
[1:32:52] to realize who you
[1:33:00] are brother amen amen paragraph 178
[1:33:04] brother R
[1:33:06] says
[1:33:08] remember when God has counted you
[1:33:14] worthy when you have a
[1:33:16] test how many of us have had tests come
[1:33:19] on
[1:33:20] brothers
[1:33:22] amen there's only there's only half of
[1:33:25] you listen there's only half of you that
[1:33:27] raise your hand so you are the ones that
[1:33:29] are
[1:33:32] loyal those of you that didn't raise
[1:33:35] your hand you ain't
[1:33:36] loyal that's what brother
[1:33:39] said I've had a now who's had a who's
[1:33:42] had a test everybody raises their
[1:33:46] hand because we're loyal
[1:33:49] brothers and that's why problems and
[1:33:51] testings
[1:33:53] come and brother and brother Bram said
[1:33:57] when you have a test now don't fail
[1:34:00] this don't fail to get this when you
[1:34:03] have a trial or a
[1:34:08] test it shows the grace of God has found
[1:34:11] you favor with
[1:34:17] God you have found favor with God when
[1:34:20] you're going through a test
[1:34:24] when's the last time the devil told you
[1:34:27] that oh
[1:34:29] Brothers he he he points all the fingers
[1:34:32] at you you didn't you didn't hear a tape
[1:34:38] yesterday oh you didn't read your
[1:34:42] Bible Brothers don't you
[1:34:45] remember that the Bible says that he
[1:34:47] died for you while you were a
[1:34:50] sinner
[1:34:54] amen amen he says and God believes God
[1:35:00] believes that you can stand the
[1:35:04] test it's you that don't believe it but
[1:35:06] God believes in
[1:35:09] you I hope we're learning a little bit
[1:35:13] of watch what he says you remember he
[1:35:17] did that same thing to
[1:35:19] job Brothers you know the sad
[1:35:23] thing can I have five
[1:35:26] minutes I I'll tell the church the other
[1:35:28] day
[1:35:31] brother I give him a secret said you
[1:35:34] said five minutes you half an
[1:35:36] hour I said because it's 5 minutes like
[1:35:39] in football
[1:35:41] time you know every time there's a foul
[1:35:44] they stop the clock and they stopped the
[1:35:47] clock and they I thought you said it was
[1:35:48] 5 minutes it was half an hour
[1:35:50] ago

[1:35:55] clock so

[1:35:59] understand so so we understand that
[1:36:02] sometimes we forget what we were called
[1:36:06] for we're here not only with a purpose
[1:36:09] but for a
[1:36:12] purpose you remember brother brand
[1:36:14] mentioned several characters in The
[1:36:18] Bible and one of my favorite was always
[1:36:20] been shamgar
[1:36:23] and brother brandham says you know that
[1:36:26] shamgar he had the right to
[1:36:29] everything yet yet he had got
[1:36:32] scared so every
[1:36:35] season Once he he picked up his Harvest
[1:36:38] you remember man
[1:36:40] said you know what would
[1:36:43] happen now he became
[1:36:46] afraid see and it's usually your fear
[1:36:49] that's going to destroy
[1:36:52] the things that you are more afraid of
[1:36:54] are the things that are going to come
[1:36:55] upon
[1:36:57] you and you know what happened brother
[1:37:00] says those Philistines would come year
[1:37:02] after year after
[1:37:05] year
[1:37:07] Shamar had had all everything
[1:37:12] ready then the Philistines would come
[1:37:14] and take
[1:37:17] everything he'd go back in there brother
[1:37:19] M say
[1:37:22] he'd go back to his house
[1:37:23] and his wife his her dress was all tore

[1:42:19] mistake I will tell you something you
[1:42:23] tell and stick that in the devil's face
[1:42:25] God did not make a
[1:42:29] mistake brother brandham said says one
[1:42:33] day there was a man that was in
[1:42:37] desperation he went out in the
[1:42:39] field and there he prayed and there he
[1:42:43] prayed until God changed his
[1:42:47] life and you know what he did he went
[1:42:50] and took a a
[1:42:52] steak and he stuck it in the
[1:42:56] ground as a
[1:42:59] memorial where he had
[1:43:01] died and God had changed
[1:43:04] him and brother brandham
[1:43:07] said next
[1:43:08] time that that devil tells
[1:43:11] you that you are not worthy that you are
[1:43:15] a
[1:43:15] sinner that he tried to put all these

[1:45:47] us it's a fire that's burning
[1:45:53] a light that's been lit by
[1:45:57] God and no Breeze can blow it
[1:46:01] out there's no cold spells in the
[1:46:05] church there's no indifference among
[1:46:09] people no persecution of the
[1:46:13] world that can blow out a flame that God
[1:46:16] has
[1:46:19] lit amen

[1:46:22] if somebody can talk you into this

[1:46:35] fire there ain't no devil in hell is
[1:46:37] going to put it
[1:46:45] out no persecution of the
[1:46:49] world can blow out of flame that God has
[1:46:53] lit for is God's
[1:46:56] purpose that he torch the light of
[1:47:00] Freedom the light of
[1:47:03] Freedom will burn until the coming of
[1:47:06] the
