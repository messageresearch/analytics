in it's nice to see each and every single one of you tonight if we can place a little subject for our topic for tonight's service like to put it as keep your eyes on Jesus Christ and as a subtitle mistakes we all have them I don't know that's all that's more than enough go home keep your eyes on me Jesus Christ we all have them they know that the devil he sold he's a really good adversary adversario and his goal is for us to take her eyes off of Jesus Christ and he'll use anything and anything that's in his reach to get a son or a daughter foreign make them to take their eyes off of him and to look at other things that they shouldn't I've done my job already yeah I can go home as long as I can get their eyes off of Jesus Christ that's all I need to do is he will use time he'll use materials he will use mistakes for us to take our eyes off of Jesus Christ are we looking at the man or are we looking at Jesus Christ as your eyes on the song leader or Jesus Christ look at that brother's suits the same exact suit all the time or our our eyes on the suit of brother Louise our eyes are on Jesus Christ the devil is so good at his job even when we come to service you'll have us to take our eyes off the world and use anything sound systems Antonio amen amen so let's keep our eyes on Jesus Christ not on time but on Jesus Christ amen the scripture says look on to me who is he talking about is it Isaiah saying look on to Isaiah it's God through the prophet Isaiah I said look on to me the Lord thy God he said and be saved if you say he said salvos all the ends of the Earth for I am God he's not know that we know that the children of Israel where they're in the wilderness what do they do they begin to complain their eyes were not on the pillar of fire their eyes what did you even take us out of here anyways because that serpent is a type of Christ I don't know if this is true or not say the only cure for a deadly serpent that bites you this is the Venom itself I don't know that's true I'm not a scientists but you notice that that that Satan in the beginning of Genesis was a serpentes and here Jesus Christ is a type he's a serpent yeah but he is a brass serpent foreign meet in and live everyone to keep our eyes on that on Jesus Christ foreign so the here from the get-go this is the holy spirit is revealing on to me I don't know if it's revealing unto you it is revealing on to me he says we make mistakes okay I'm going to say that again we make mistakes you because you're always amen amen oh so after I get baptized I'm still gonna make mistakes even I've been in the church for 15 20 years I'm still going to make mistakes on this place is you're always but don't look at them look at the mistakes but you see it's following his rules [Music] a real true servant this is he'll get up again so it's not about the mistakes thank God for the message now I feel good because if someone makes mistakes you're looking at them a real true servant um he'll get up again if he wobbles a bit God pulls them right back in the past [Music] as long as he's in the path of Duty oh so we have to be somewhere in that line of duty we have to be in his words because sometimes following his word we make mistakes trying to follow his words we have the message before us and it's a hard thing to live that message and you're going to make mistakes when you try to follow that message says he's going to pull you right back as long long as you're in the path of Duty but if he's off the path of Duty God's not obligated to him oh so we have to be somewhere God has called you and say oh sister you you're a sinner you got to repent do you say oh yes you have to receive the Holy Ghost [Music] oh so we have to be [Music] we make the mistake God's gonna say okay just come right back if we are duties God's not obligated but as long as he's in the path to duties wow God's obligated obligated that he is just a man or a woman see God knows and God understands that we're human beings he understands he understands that you're a woman he knows that one of these days we're going to make mistakes knowing that we're just a man and woman he says okay this is obligated to that Persona as long as they're in a path of Duty we're always going to have them now we're we are all going to make mistakes that makes me feel good because sometimes I look myself in the mirror and I feel like I'm the only one in this boat yeah and the boat says you know you had some certain Boat Type names oh so I have buddies with me in the same city amen amen amen amen we're all going to make mistakes just remember and when you're going to look at one another um don't look at the other person's mistake de lotro were you going to look at somebody don't look at the other person's mistakes see don't do that because remember mistakes amen amen they don't do that because you make mistakes but look to Christ who's guiding that person that person's trying to serve Christ he's in the line of duty she's trying to do something yes we're gonna make mistakes as we go but as long as we're in that line of duty God's gonna pick them right back up and you know what's going to happen we're going to gain experience for the benefit of the kingdom of God amen amen but look who's in that person look that it's Christ guiding that person [Music] when you're praying for somebody else so if we're sick in our body and our soul and our mind your spirit when we pray for somebody God's going to heal you that's what the prophet says when you're praying for somebody else that's right I see yes that's what Christianity is based upon to help one another do for one another be kind to one another understanding one another now if you see your neighbor's mistakes you see where they went wrong don't go wrong with them but just pray for them just keep praying and God will understand that is we all have them and you see the devil is so good at his job make us look at mistakes I got a list right here how long how many mistakes and the scroll says there goes all the way to the back he said but you know what God does he grabs that roll he grabs it is waiting for me to confess my mistakes and get back in the line of duty when I do that I have to do it first I have to do that first in the lake [Music] it says like this is now here's Jesus talking to his disciples and straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and go and to go before him on to the other side while he went to the multitudes away and he sent the multitudes away now notice now Jesus is giving his disciples an order he said he constrained his disciples or he ordered his disciples get on a ship and to go without him while he stays behind and now verse 23 and when he had sent the multitude away he went up into a mountain part to pray and the evening was coming he was there alone solo and now verse 24 but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with ways for the wind was contrary you say is what key number one Jesus gives them an order Jesus the same thing when God gives us the message he told them what to do they obeyed and now what what happened their ship was in the middle of the sea and the ship was being tossed by the waves for the win was contrary now notice when God tells you something to do when he tells you through his message what to do contrario that's always the way it's going to be when God gives you a message when God sends you somewhere when God calls you to get baptized if you want to get baptized or you want to receive the Holy Ghost what happened things start to go wrong because who controls the wind the Devil Himself Diablo that principalities and high places that we don't see Los principals the devil was controlling the wind that was contrary and on the verse 25 and uh and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the scene Jesus and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were trouble saying it is it is a spirit and they cry out for fear but straightway Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid and Peter answered him and said Lord if it be thou bid me on bid me come unto thee on the water is now notice it was Peter Pedro that asked Jesus to get on the water Jesus it was Peter that said it first or let me go in the waters and when Peter would come down under the ship he walked out of the water to Jesus but when he saw the wind he was afraid he said he began to sink and he cried saying Lord save me and admittedly Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him oh thou little faith wherefore there is thou doubt Jesus now he was in the waters but he was looking unto Jesus Christ but the wind started to hit him very contrary that Satan gives and he began to look at the winds instead of looking at Jesus Christ sometimes we you know what we just have to look in our eye look at our eyes of Jesus Christ don't look at nothing else point of Doctrine uh they teach that or they teach this is keep your eyes on Jesus Christ he is the message [Music] just keep your eyes on him he will take you to the right place I'd rather be wrong in my Doctrine this is teachings and so forth I rather be wrong and that is but I'd rather have a good spirit then rather have be right in my Doctrine wrong in my [Music] so where do we have to have our eyes on Jesus Christ nothing else no no just on Jesus Christ remember the devil will use any because they talk about their mistakes about here everybody makes mistakes I come to church because Jesus saved me Jesus because he saved me does he love me when no one else did I don't come here because of the mistakes no no we don't look at them that's what all the devil wants to do you see what that [Music] it's only on Jesus Christ nothing else well the brother made the mistake he fell he made a mistake oh he's human he's saved by grace man amen so you see that Peter Pedro took his life of all his eyes off of Jesus Christ and look at the wind Peter brother Ram says decent amount of Branham Peter was all steamed up one night he said on the scene and when he got into desperation and he began to cry out there's there's there is something wrong I see a Spirit come walking to me and the ship was about to go down he said if it'd be you Lord pay me to come with you on the water because and he stepped down out of the ship and started and he got scared when he's when he's when he got started to sing sometimes we feel like that yeah or mistakes makes us feel like we're thinking I made this mistake recordia [Music] [Music] revelation [Music] I'm going to say that again because the what he is scared of the little that you do know you put it into actions because Revelations and it took one little Stone one little Revelation a big one little revelation it's not about knowledge it's about Revelation a revelation Revelation but it's not about the other brothers it's about God's grace still Grace amen amen brother Branham says though a mistake this is trying to follow the Commandments of God so Peter made a mistake he aired he failed Jesus said and what did Peter fell Pedro he made a mistake in trying to follow God's commands brother says I hope the church gets that this is it says I hope the church if you go to the next light sister there you go it says I hope the church gets that if they say okay the man el hombre was doing what God told him to do is [Music] because he was in a line of duty he was trying to follow what God told him and it's hard to follow what God tells us to do yeah this message is but we make mistakes as we're trying to get there but God sees the mistake God pulls us right back no you're my son you get back up that's where I want to stay stay in God's word that's fine God's obligated to you bye pero Al moment let's go to First Kings you love the Lord keep your eyes on Jesus Christ First Kings the 19th Chapter 1919 so here Elias it says like this is so he Departed thence and found Elisha the son of Shabbat or who was plowing with 12 yoke of oxen before him and he with the twelfth and Elijah passed by him and cast his mantle upon him so what do we what do we find here let's take it step by step so here a key we find that Elisha here he's plowing the ground he's working in the field and he has 12 auctions and he's on the 12th one yes there he is working the ground never thought much of what God had for him profeta Elijah Elias and he saw elishao and he grabs he takes off his mantle izakita sumanto and puts it on top of Elijah and notice and he left excuse me in the 20th 20th verse and he left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said let me I pray thee kiss my father and my mother then I will follow thee and he said unto him go back again for what have I done today is Elijah takes off the mantle off of Elisha yeah they're Elijah recognized that God was calling him so then Elijah said well let me first let me kiss my father and my mother goodbye Madre Elijah said go back I'm not stopping you don't you know and he returned back from him and he took a yoke of oxen and slew them and boiled their flesh with the instruments of The Oxen and gave on to the people and they did eat and then he arose and went after Elijah and ministered onto him we say is so then here Elisha realized that this is not time for him to go back and say goodbye to Mom and Dad so what he did he sacrificed those accents use and he got rid of it all and he followed Elijah Alias now brother Branham says that that he put the mantle over Elijah that's what it said right there on the on the 19th verse I look at this mother says it took Elijah for 10 years for that mentota fit Elijah it took him 10 years because it wasn't that the man who had to fit Elisha had to fit the mantle Elise the God God's word doesn't have to fit us we have to fit in God's word and it took Elisha 10 years yes to follow Elijah so follow him to be right right next to him you imagine studying under the feet of Elijah took him 10 years now it wasn't that the mantle was something special it was just a robe but he was the Holy Spirit it's not the mountain that's holy it's the Holy Ghost on the mountains when Jesus was coming into the city of Jerusalem with a donkey because it was Jesus on top of the donkey no Iraq Jesus so we find that when we want to follow Jesus Christ we find that those those potential disciples wanted to follow Jesus they told Jesus well let me say Let me let me get married first let me let me bury the dead first episode let me say goodbye to my father and my mother he said [Music] we're now willing to leave father or mothers not worthy of the kingdom of God then we find later on in the scriptures that were Elisha it was his time to go okay he was tired and he told Elijah you know I'm gonna go right yeah I know he said just get back I'm not going to leave you know as long as your soul lives he said and if the father lives I will not leave to stand right next to the message and right next to Jesus Christ for all the critics they gave Elijah and how many times did Elijah told Elisha to go back how many times Juan Una to those three times Perfection Perfection Eliza told them three times I will not leave I'm going to be right here brother Branham says that Elijah okay Elias he tried to discourage Elijah try to get out of here go just go back to see what Elisha would do that's what those mistakes do is mistakes here there's mistakes there at the church to discourage let's see if he'll go back Elijah said I'm not going back I'm going to stay right here thick and thin I'm going to be right here okay Elijah had his Association or Elisha with Elijah Association that Great Mighty Prophet is do you remember how Elijah called him he threw his mantle over him and followed him to gilgal and to many places [Music] and I want you to notice how Elisha knew that he was going to be called The Prophet The Prophet Elijah said [Music] Elijah tried in a roundabout way to leave Elisha behind Elias and another message brother said he tried to discourage him try to get him out of the way are you being discouraged God tries to see what you are going to do to try to discourage Elijah tried to discourage Elijah that's what brother Branham says to see what you're going to do because there's something coming let's see let's see if he gets out of here because the mistakes does those things see if you're gonna go back because he has something down the road he tried in a roundabout to try to leave Elijah behind Elijah said as the Lord and your soul never dies I'm not going to leave I like that is when a man has been born again of the spirit of God we've got to be born again you know a lot of the the big phrase today I was born this way you know the homosexuals I was born I'm born like this I'm born like that that's why you have to be born again I was born like this that's true because you were born in equity that's why you must be born again I like that when a man has been born again of the spirit of God and he sets his eyes towards heaven keep your eyes set that way keep your eyes towards the prize doesn't matter what happens I'll be here and over there the devil will use anything so you can get your eyes off of him keep your eyes on him a man who's been born again to the spirit of God sets his eyes towards heaven keep your eyes set that way don't leave him for no one or nothing else well I'm going to follow my cousin because he's my cousin me Primo don't leave for nobody else just keep your eyes on Christ in Christ don't leave him for no one person on my boyfriend he went to the world I'm going with my boyfriend let him go to the world you stay keep your eyes on Jesus Christ Jesus Christ [Music] look towards heaven if you've really been born again mistakes will not let you get bothered by that is what the ram says and he got up there and said now you stay here the Lord is calling me to the school of prophets he said as the Lord lives and as you're in your soul never die I'm going I'm going with you I'm not going to leave you you said that's the church this is keep your eyes on Jesus wherever he moves just like there are no times in the wilderness it's about to get spicy I mean like spicy food if he goes out of the Methodist Church go on right on with him if he goes out the Baptist Church go out right with him he goes out the Branham Tabernacle he says go right on with him see brother Ram doesn't even Point him to his points us to his own Tabernacles he points us to Jesus Christ because he's not coming for a tabernacle he's coming for the elected those who have placed Their Eyes On Jesus Christ if he goes out of the Branham Tabernacles I'll not leave you oh it's a bad game more spicy now no matter where mama [Music] sometimes we get attached to a certain things I'll go with you I will not leave you Hallelujah I'm your witness I can't go you're a part of me notice when he got there he stood Jordan before him he took off his mentor Elijah and he struck the water and it went across oh my now if you now notice and he said oh why is Pikachu he says and listen now that you've crossed this keep your eye on me because what did Elijah wants Elijah tried to get him to go back try to discourage him foreign I want a double portion of your spirit that's a heavy thing you're asking me that's a hard thing you're asking for this is you keep your eyes on me don't take your eyes off of me then you'll get it why do we have to have our eyes on and kill them on Jesus Christ in Jesus Christ and God sent a prophet that is the closest thing to Christ with God he's not Christ no Jesus Christ but he is the seven Angel messenger keep your eyes on Elijah William Branham William Branham right to discourage mistakes that brother Brandon did there's a lot of mistakes that brother Branham did I don't follow that Prophet anymore that's what Elijah said that's what brother Branham says look at this Cinema he tried to get him to go back he said I'm not going to leave you anyway I don't care how many mistakes Elijah says what do you want Elisha who's the Elisha of our days well you're asking for a double portion of my spirit that's a hard thing you ask brother yeah that's a big thing buddy if you keep your eyes on me don't take your eyes off the prophets and if you see me when I go you get it foreign keep your eye on me now after you come through and separated everything separated through the world now these things so build yourself keep your eye on me we've got too many crossed I Christians if you want to take it that way that's what brothers and the other one in the world says take it off Look to Him only well I'll see what my neighbor says about it he said I'll see what this guy says what do I care what they say they don't save you God save you [Music] Jesus Christ keep your eyes on the end in La meta there when Elijah was looking at Elijah cuando Elias there he is booking and gold the Chariots of Fire came yeah Elijah didn't die he got raptured and he kept looking at him and what did he see coming down from the heavens he saw the mantle coming down what is the mantle the Holy Spirit Waters of Jordan yes double [Music] [Music] the Miracles what Elijah did yeah brother Branham says that's the same thing with Jesus Christ I don't have to call I don't I'm not going to read this too much time says that's why we can't get a double portion today that's why we can't get a double portion today because we're not looking at them we're looking at something else you want to double portion of the Holy Spirit don't take your eyes off wherever he goes Jesus is coming keep your eyes to the end the eagle has a long distance don't just look on what's going to happen the next hour Jesus is coming Jesus what will it be then no matter what the people say about you now no important how you're persecuted for all the live Godly in Christ Jesus I suffer persecution being made fun of my father so forth Watch what it would be at the end and that's where it will pay off that'll be good for you that's the vitamins that's more than enough for you is that would be good for you oh but God this and that this brother makes the mistake and that makes a mistakes as long as you're in the path to duty like a hundred mistakes in a day I was going to take you right back and God's obligated to that man obligated to that system as long as you're in the posted I'm not obligated to us we don't want to make mistakes you don't want to try to make mistakes that's why God said just get right back foreign and just have the understanding and the Revelation that you're not saved by work you're saved by grace how many less mistakes you do how many mistakes you can do I don't care about that is important I don't keep tally at how many mistakes just get right back up because you're not saved by works
