[43:13] Jesus Christ we
[43:16] pray amen and amen
[43:21] amen praise the
[43:24] Lord let's go straight into our
[43:28] scriptures let us open our Bibles to
[43:31] First John 1 verse
[43:47] 5 someone say Amen when they
[43:50] have amen it reads as
[43:55] follows
[43:58] this then is the message which we have
[44:01] heard of him and declare unto you that
[44:04] God is light and in him is no Darkness
[44:07] at
[44:15] all verse six if we say that we have
[44:19] fellowship with him and walk in darkness
[44:21] we lie and do not the
[44:25] truth
[44:32] verse seven but if we walk in the light
[44:35] as he is in the light we have Fellowship
[44:38] one with another and the blood of Jesus
[44:40] Christ his son cleanses us cleanseth us
[44:43] from all
[44:44] [Music]
[44:53] sin amen may God bless the reading of
[44:55] his
[44:57] word you may be
[45:01] seated thank you for your
[45:04] reverence for God deserves all the
[45:11] reverence so I'd like to title this
[45:13] sermon the Christian
[45:19] Light and as a
[45:21] subtitle a life in Christ can't go
[45:24] unnoticed
[45:29] so we know that God is
[45:32] light and as we walk with him in
[45:36] truth the blood of his son
[45:39] Jesus wipes us clean from all our
[45:44] sin that's a beautiful scripture of his
[45:49] grace what more do we
[45:52] want now on uh Monday when I was at work
[45:58] uh a young female coworker of
[46:04] mine she uh came up to me and uh asked
[46:07] me a
[46:10] question she asked
[46:14] me what was it that that that made me uh
[46:18] always be in a cheerful mood as in uh uh
[46:21] smiling happy uh never seen me
[46:24] upset
[46:32] and I explained to
[46:35] her that uh it was
[46:38] Jesus God changed me I told
[46:41] her I said I have my
[46:44] days I'm human
[46:47] too and she said that U many people
[46:50] there are
[46:53] negative and that they're uh usually
[46:55] usually always
[46:58] upset I told her that they're
[47:02] spirits that tormenting
[47:06] people and uh those spirits will try to
[47:08] uh ruin your
[47:11] day if we allow them
[47:14] to I believe that's the same in in uh
[47:17] many
[47:20] situations so the devil gets in at
[47:24] times and he tries to stir things
[47:27] up we need to learn to brush that
[47:31] off to keep our our eyes on
[47:35] Calvary love one another as much as we
[47:40] can and just continue
[47:45] forward and I just I just told her to to
[47:48] pray for them
[47:51] people and uh I I usually tell everyone
[47:54] that to to pray for one another
[47:59] something that's really
[48:01] important or even Jesus prayed for his
[48:04] 12 disciples the whole entire
[48:08] day before he made his choice who his
[48:10] disciples would
[48:13] be in uh Gethsemane in GE also he prayed
[48:18] to the father as as he was feeling the
[48:22] the anxiety and that of of going to
[48:25] Calvary
[48:31] something really
[48:33] tremendous it shows us that that he was
[48:38] human though he still had the Supreme
[48:41] deity in
[48:44] him he still knew what what he felt to
[48:47] be a
[48:49] human he felt every bit of
[48:53] pain for you and I
[48:57] that's a good
[48:59] God he the Creator stepped into his
[49:05] creation to save you and our and to save
[49:08] you and I for for for the sake of our
[49:12] Salvation so that we would have a way of
[49:16] Escape God that I leave his his gold
[49:19] streets and many
[49:23] mansions to come down here to to to to
[49:26] show you his way of
[49:31] humility to wash dirty
[49:34] feet to show us that humble way of a
[49:39] Christian that's a good
[49:42] God I'll serve that
[49:45] God I'll take my stand for that
[49:48] God I'll die for that
[49:54] God
[49:56] now uh let's uh read another
[50:01] scripture we'll go to uh John 8
[50:07] verse2 then spake Jesus again unto them
[50:11] saying I am the light of the world he
[50:13] that followeth me shall not walk in
[50:15] darkness but shall have the light of
[50:24] life
[50:28] so that is the light that that people
[50:30] see in
[50:34] Christian that like that young woman at
[50:36] my
[50:38] church they'll literally come up to you
[50:40] and say what is
[50:45] it it's that
[50:47] light that Jesus puts in you once you
[50:50] surrender to
[50:54] him you're new
[50:56] creature your old nature
[51:00] dies and and all you do is is think
[51:02] about
[51:05] Christ the minute you do something
[51:08] wrong you're trying to fix
[51:11] it you can't let the sun go down on on
[51:14] after you done tooken your wrath on
[51:16] someone or
[51:20] anything it's just something a Christian
[51:22] can't
[51:24] do
[51:27] that that light isn't from you and
[51:30] I but from our Lord and Savior Jesus
[51:34] Christ when we walk in the
[51:37] light we have fellowship with
[51:40] him let let us read a sermon of brother
[51:45] branham's titled his wonders to
[51:52] perform uh preached in 58012
[51:58] 12 paragraph 30 I
[52:01] believe and as they were reading and uh
[52:05] the sacred fire was burning they
[52:07] worshiped the one true God by a sacred
[52:10] fire they watched the licking of the
[52:13] blazes for they knew that the one true
[52:17] God dwelt in
[52:24] light
[52:35] and that's true God dwells in
[52:40] light when he was on Earth he manifested
[52:43] in flesh he said I am the light of the
[52:45] world because God was manifested through
[52:54] him
[52:57] and he was the light the pillar of fire
[52:59] that led the children of
[53:05] Israel he was a light that struck Paul
[53:08] down on his road to
[53:14] Damascus he was a light that come into
[53:16] the prison with
[53:20] Peter he's the light that's on that
[53:24] picture
[53:27] he's the light that's in my
[53:31] heart he's the light that's in this
[53:36] church he is the Everlasting
[53:42] Light and in him is no
[53:46] darkness and they who walk in the light
[53:48] have fellowship with one
[53:52] another while the blood of Jesus Christ
[53:54] God God's son cleanses us from all
[54:01] sin walking in the
[54:03] light you have fellowship with the
[54:06] Baptist you have fellowship with the
[54:07] Methodist you have fellowship with the
[54:10] Pentecostal you have fellowship with
[54:12] God's children in every denomination if
[54:14] we're walking in the
[54:24] light
[54:28] don't worry that light will lead
[54:32] you amen
[54:34] amen how can people in the world deny or
[54:37] disbelief that Jesus Christ Rose from
[54:39] the
[54:43] grave the evidence lays right before
[54:46] their
[54:48] eyes and you and
[54:52] I it's a radiant and and it's radiant
[54:55] and
[54:57] captivating especially to those without
[55:00] it it oozes out of us like a
[55:05] volcano you can't miss it when it's
[55:07] around
[55:09] you so much that people will literally
[55:11] come up to you and ask you what is
[55:16] it why are you always
[55:19] happy I never see you
[55:22] mad this that's not our nature
[55:26] he's asked us to
[55:29] Rejoice the debt is paid
[55:32] already we have eternal
[55:34] life that is all the more to fight for
[55:39] it God is
[55:43] amazing he's my
[55:46] everything I can't live without
[55:48] him and we should all feel that
[55:52] way all is well when Jesus comes to stay
[55:56] when he enters in your
[55:58] heart you're like that bubbling stream
[56:00] brother brandom talked
[56:03] about he asked it is it the deer that
[56:05] drink from
[56:07] you is it so and so animal that drink
[56:10] from
[56:12] you is it that I drink from
[56:15] you no the the the the bubbling stream
[56:18] would tell
[56:20] him that no it's none of
[56:23] that it's something behind behind me
[56:25] making me
[56:28] Bubble that's what the born again
[56:30] Christian feels
[56:33] like something behind you just pushing
[56:37] you you can't stay at
[56:40] home you want to come to church and
[56:42] serve the
[56:44] Lord you want to see your brothers that
[56:46] you're going to spend eternity
[56:49] with it brings Joy To Your
[56:53] Heart brother brandom says to be a
[56:55] Christian is to live for
[56:58] others it's my pleasure to take my stand
[57:00] with the breth Nam
[57:03] Chandler if they're opening a door where
[57:06] I can get behind the
[57:09] pulpit and I can let their precious
[57:11] Pastor there relax and enjoy a
[57:15] sermon oh it's my
[57:18] pleasure the Lord Honors
[57:20] that I want to earn my way up
[57:23] there
[57:25] God is
[57:28] good your joy and happiness is that
[57:33] light that Christ puts in
[57:36] you and it can't be
[57:39] hid people see it and they feel
[57:42] it they know you aren't the
[57:45] same they know something's different
[57:47] about
[57:49] you that's the
[57:51] truth let's go to Matthew 5:14
[57:56] we'll read up to the 16th
[58:03] verse ye are the light of the world a
[58:06] city that is set on a hill cannot be
[58:16] hid neither do men light a candle and
[58:18] put it under a bushel but on a
[58:21] Candlestick and is giveth light unto all
[58:24] are in the
[58:32] house verse
[58:35] 16 let your light so shine before men
[58:38] that they may see your good works and
[58:39] glorify your father which is in
[58:48] heaven amen amen that light should go
[58:52] with you everywhere that you go
[58:56] if it doesn't follow
[58:58] you you're somewhere you shouldn't
[59:02] be and the holy
[59:04] ghost that light that's in
[59:06] you flies away like a dove from
[59:12] you and it lands in a Tree near
[59:15] you and it waits for you to make
[59:20] right patiently it's waiting there for
[59:22] you to come and make right
[59:26] so we can enter back in with you and
[59:28] have
[59:30] Fellowship but once again when you got
[59:34] it it will be noticed it can't be hid
[59:38] the very nature isn't of this
[59:41] world you're a new
[59:44] creature it isn't you
[59:47] anymore but Christ Jesus living in
[59:50] you now God reminds us to be courageous
[59:53] in his word
[59:58] as found in Joshua 1
[1:00:02] n have not I commanded thee be strong
[1:00:06] and of good courage Be not Afraid
[1:00:08] neither be thou dismayed for the Lord
[1:00:10] thy God is with thee withs soever thou
[1:00:22] goest now that scripture for all of
[1:00:26] us given from given from
[1:00:29] God but he wants courageous
[1:00:33] youth that'll take their
[1:00:36] stand and say to the dirty Ling
[1:00:40] devil like David said in his
[1:00:44] youth he told
[1:00:46] Goliath look here you uncircumcised
[1:00:51] Philistine I will not allow you to
[1:00:53] defile the armies of the living
[1:00:58] God I come to you in the name of the
[1:01:00] Lord of
[1:01:02] hosts and this day will the Lord deliver
[1:01:05] your head into my
[1:01:08] hands oh
[1:01:11] yes with Valor and courage in your
[1:01:15] heart he wants you to be a warrior for
[1:01:18] him he wants you to not be afraid to
[1:01:21] take your stand for
[1:01:23] him as I said earlier he took his stand
[1:01:26] for us on
[1:01:30] Calvary we ow him our
[1:01:33] lives he shed his innocent blood as a
[1:01:36] sinner in our
[1:01:39] place that penalty and debt he paid was
[1:01:42] a brutal
[1:01:45] suffering yet whipped bleeding and beat
[1:01:48] to a
[1:01:50] pope he still had to carry that cross up
[1:01:53] to Calvary
[1:01:56] in the midst of being mocked and spit
[1:02:00] on he was exhausted and
[1:02:04] thirsty when he reached the top of the
[1:02:07] mountain all this suffering was done for
[1:02:11] us it makes me want to do something for
[1:02:13] his
[1:02:15] kingdom if he's asked me to die to this
[1:02:19] world and pick up my
[1:02:21] cross that's what I'll do
[1:02:24] he's not asking me to go hang on a
[1:02:28] tree there's so much that we need to to
[1:02:31] to
[1:02:33] understand that he gave us his
[1:02:36] all when he had all up there
[1:02:39] already but yet he wanted a fellowship
[1:02:41] with
[1:02:43] us and he came down and took that
[1:02:47] sacrifice now like uh on S on Saturdays
[1:02:50] I like to
[1:02:53] hike when I when I have the
[1:02:55] chance I wear a a lot of
[1:03:00] camel it's like brother Brandon when he
[1:03:02] said that he never got to go into the
[1:03:04] military or or the army or
[1:03:09] anything but he's in the army of God
[1:03:13] really but I like to wear an Air Force
[1:03:18] hat Air Force and it it reads uh Special
[1:03:23] Operations
[1:03:26] and of course you guys
[1:03:28] know I'm not a service member of our
[1:03:33] military but it has a spiritual meaning
[1:03:35] behind
[1:03:37] it the Air Force jets take flight
[1:03:40] through the
[1:03:42] air and I believe one day I will
[1:03:48] too but even further and faster than
[1:03:52] that in a twinkle of a I will be changed
[1:03:55] my
[1:03:58] friends the Air Force won't be able to
[1:04:00] keep up with
[1:04:04] usce now I ask you you can call that
[1:04:07] special
[1:04:10] operation we need we need to continue
[1:04:14] fighting with the mighty light he's
[1:04:16] given
[1:04:18] us as you know it's not the size of the
[1:04:20] dog in the
[1:04:23] fight it's the size of the fight in the
[1:04:27] dog and when the Holy Spirit becomes to
[1:04:30] come down on his
[1:04:32] people get ready buckle on that whole
[1:04:34] armor of
[1:04:36] God because he's
[1:04:38] alive he's not dead brother brandham
[1:04:41] says that we're a shadow of
[1:04:44] his and he's more alive than
[1:04:47] us so when we can comprehend
[1:04:50] that oh we're going to get somewhere
[1:04:52] with our Lord
[1:04:56] we should take it like when you see a
[1:04:57] dead animal on the side of the
[1:05:01] road and it's been there for a few days
[1:05:04] we'll
[1:05:06] say we'll say it's a
[1:05:09] dog after a few a few days the the body
[1:05:12] becomes starts to
[1:05:16] shrink and spiritually in in in our
[1:05:20] way when we die to this world
[1:05:24] when we're born
[1:05:26] again we as well should shrink and
[1:05:29] become small before the
[1:05:32] Lord not only before the Lord but before
[1:05:35] his
[1:05:37] people operate with
[1:05:39] love
[1:05:41] respect and know when the devil's
[1:05:43] sneaking in the
[1:05:46] camp that dirty devil
[1:05:48] out you guys know he's a
[1:05:51] liar we got to keep our eyes on
[1:05:57] he's trying to break
[1:05:59] us but God's program is always right on
[1:06:03] on on
[1:06:06] Perfection as his
[1:06:09] word that's the truth and nothing but
[1:06:11] the
[1:06:13] truth brother brandom says we're not on
[1:06:15] a
[1:06:17] picnic but we're in a
[1:06:21] battlefield it's not against mortal
[1:06:23] flesh
[1:06:25] but against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:06:29] places it's a spiritual
[1:06:32] warfare we must not only put the whole
[1:06:35] armor of God
[1:06:37] on but we must keep that light within
[1:06:42] us until the end of the
[1:06:45] world and if you don't stay prayed
[1:06:49] up and filled with the word of
[1:06:52] God by pressing play or reading the
[1:06:57] word Satan and the world will begin to
[1:06:59] settle in your
[1:07:03] house let us stay Gun Barrel
[1:07:07] straight on this unadulterated word of
[1:07:10] the Living
[1:07:13] God that's what we need to
[1:07:19] do we need to continue loving and
[1:07:22] respecting one another as we should
[1:07:27] for it is love that conquers
[1:07:30] all and which cast out all Devils
[1:07:34] too now at times I can be
[1:07:38] nervous and I've seen other brethren in
[1:07:41] the same
[1:07:44] condition whether you're doing something
[1:07:46] for the
[1:07:48] Lord or just a nervous person in
[1:07:52] general you know brother brandom says
[1:07:54] you know what he says about nervous
[1:07:58] people that they're the most spiritual
[1:08:02] people so don't count them people
[1:08:06] out you pray for
[1:08:09] them we're all in the same
[1:08:12] fight we're all trying to make it
[1:08:16] home we all want the best for one
[1:08:19] another regardless of our
[1:08:22] titles
[1:08:24] regardless of who we think we
[1:08:28] are in in in the way of of uh living in
[1:08:31] this
[1:08:33] world sometimes uh we'll have a a
[1:08:36] position in in the world as in uh at our
[1:08:42] jobs we may we may make uh good
[1:08:46] money and like brother brandom says
[1:08:48] you'll buy yourself a fur cat and you'll
[1:08:50] drown in the
[1:08:52] rain
[1:08:56] you walk with your nose in the air
[1:08:58] that's that's not that's not the
[1:08:59] Christlike
[1:09:04] way need we need to be humble as
[1:09:08] possible love one
[1:09:11] another live according to this
[1:09:15] word we can prepare and and work
[1:09:20] hard save our money and and have good
[1:09:22] jobs
[1:09:25] but don't don't let it change your
[1:09:28] character keep Christ in your
[1:09:32] heart love your fellow Brethren with
[1:09:34] with all you
[1:09:37] have the minute you get in a bad Vibe
[1:09:40] with the
[1:09:43] brother I want you to go look in the
[1:09:46] mirror look at yourself
[1:09:49] first ask the God as ask the god of of
[1:09:53] of this might Mighty word to change
[1:09:57] you that you don't want that bitterness
[1:09:59] in your
[1:10:02] heart you know uh brother brandham says
[1:10:04] it's okay to disagree with your
[1:10:09] brethren but you need to love
[1:10:12] him and and I can raise my hand I live
[1:10:17] that I love my
[1:10:19] lord for the scripture
[1:10:22] says he that said says he loves God that
[1:10:24] he has not
[1:10:27] seen and hates his brother that he has
[1:10:32] seen that's a
[1:10:35] liar I don't I don't I don't think we
[1:10:37] have any of them
[1:10:40] here I see the bride of Christ
[1:10:43] here God is
[1:10:45] good praise the
[1:10:52] Lord
[1:10:56] for it is love that conquers all as I
[1:11:02] said we can only continue uh letting the
[1:11:06] Lord lead
[1:11:11] us we should always stay in unity as
[1:11:18] Brethren and uh uh many of you know and
[1:11:22] and I'm not ashamed to to admit it
[1:11:27] my fellowship isn't the
[1:11:32] greatest so I ask you to keep me in
[1:11:36] prayer because in that same
[1:11:39] way God knows what you
[1:11:42] need God knows you're not ashamed to ask
[1:11:45] your brethren for
[1:11:48] help for
[1:11:50] prayer because you want your heart to be
[1:11:52] changed
[1:11:55] we're all God's light in
[1:11:58] progress we all have
[1:12:01] trials we all have our
[1:12:04] battles we all have a
[1:12:07] duty Jesus said to go out to all the
[1:12:10] world and preach the
[1:12:13] gospel and to baptize in his
[1:12:17] name and these signs would follow them
[1:12:19] that
[1:12:22] believe that's your duty as
[1:12:25] well you can talk to your
[1:12:28] neighbor talk to your
[1:12:30] co-workers it's not just the Ministries
[1:12:32] team's
[1:12:35] job it's not just our precious pastor's
[1:12:40] job each and every person in
[1:12:43] Christ he's he's given us that that last
[1:12:49] commission we should obey
[1:12:52] it
[1:12:57] let's go to a sermon uh titled the
[1:13:02] Shalom shom preach
[1:13:09] 64119 paragraph
[1:13:13] 223 or or it might be
[1:13:18] 92 now the same word that was reflected
[1:13:22] in Moses could not be reflected in
[1:13:24] Elijah because that's another day same
[1:13:28] one that was reflected in Noah could not
[1:13:30] be in Moses cuz see Noah built an
[1:13:49] ark Moses led a people just exactly what
[1:13:53] was
[1:13:56] promised the same light was reflected in
[1:13:59] one wasn't in the
[1:14:04] other but one told of the other
[1:14:08] one all of the New Testament speaks of
[1:14:11] this
[1:14:13] hour Jesus Christ speaks of this
[1:14:17] hour who is then some
[1:14:20] man it's Jesus Christ the son of God
[1:14:25] manifes and reflecting the light on the
[1:14:27] word that he promised for this
[1:14:33] day when men see you living like
[1:14:37] him when he sees your
[1:14:40] character your
[1:14:42] conduct with the word just exactly like
[1:14:45] he
[1:14:47] was the word being
[1:14:51] manifested then men will see Jesus
[1:14:55] Christ they won't have to look around
[1:14:57] anywhere and say what does this Creed
[1:15:03] teach what does that Creed
[1:15:06] teach they'll know what God is when they
[1:15:09] see
[1:15:11] you shalom shalom God's peace be with be
[1:15:15] be light upon
[1:15:17] you and when God's word is Vindicated in
[1:15:20] this age

[1:15:55] the world is dying for
[1:15:58] love we know that God is
[1:16:01] love and if love conquers
[1:16:04] all then in that matter we must
[1:16:16] operate not only to one another as
[1:16:18] fellow
[1:16:20] Brethren but with everyone in the world
[1:16:24] in hopes that we can win souls to the
[1:16:28] Lord through that light of love my
[1:16:33] friends in uh 1 Corinthians
[1:16:40] 16:14 it
[1:16:42] reads let all your things be done with
[1:16:49] Charity amen amen charity is love as we

[1:17:07] hope those who live and worship in
[1:17:10] spirit and in
[1:17:12] truth where the Holy Spirit can operate
[1:17:16] in to save anybody that will come to the
[1:17:19] feet of Jesus
[1:17:21] Christ he he said and him that cometh to
[1:17:26] me I will in no wise cast
[1:17:29] out in order for faith in the Son of God
[1:17:32] to

[1:17:59] Christian but even that the ones that

[1:23:00] 46 it reads as
[1:23:04] follows for God who commanded the light
[1:23:07] to shine out of Darkness has shined in
[1:23:10] our hearts to give the light of the
[1:23:12] knowledge of the glory of God in the
[1:23:14] face of Jesus
[1:23:21] Christ
[1:23:33] thank you
[1:23:34] Lord let's read another sermon the last
[1:23:38] one preached in
[1:23:45] 54321 paragraph
[1:23:49] 47 titles uh the name of the title is
[1:23:53] what think ye of
[1:23:57] Christ looking at those little sparrows
[1:23:59] laying
[1:24:02] there I said to the guide what I said to
[1:24:05] the guide that that was with me I said
[1:24:08] what's the matter with them little
[1:24:13] birds he said they they died last
[1:24:17] night said there was a storm come
[1:24:20] up and they was flying right in the
[1:24:24] storm and said they come they come into
[1:24:27] the light instead of using the light
[1:24:29] from the Statue of
[1:24:35] Liberty said those are un they come try
[1:24:39] to dock the light
[1:24:42] out and they beat against it with their
[1:24:45] little
[1:24:47] heads until they beat their brains
[1:24:51] out
[1:24:54] and they're laying there
[1:24:56] dead because they refuse to follow the
[1:25:00] light they tried to beat it
[1:25:03] out I said oh God what an example it
[1:25:08] is and men and women raising up
[1:25:13] today and people who are trying to deny
[1:25:15] God's
[1:25:18] Bible and Jesus to be the Virgin born
[1:25:21] son of God
[1:25:27] they're just beating their brains out
[1:25:29] instead of taking the
[1:25:33] light the baptism of the Holy
[1:25:37] Ghost and dashing on to Victory and
[1:25:40] power and
[1:25:44] overcoming they're only beating their
[1:25:46] heads
[1:25:48] out God's church will remain forever
[1:25:55] Upon This Rock I will build my
[1:25:59] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[1:26:01] Prevail against
[1:26:04] it when Peter made his great
[1:26:08] confession Thou Art the Christ the son
[1:26:10] of the Living
[1:26:12] God he said blessed art thou Peter for
[1:26:15] flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[1:26:20] you he never never learned it in a
[1:26:24] seminary he never learned it from what
[1:26:26] somebody else
[1:26:29] said but my Father which is in heaven
[1:26:32] has revealed it to
[1:26:34] you and Upon This Rock I'll build my
[1:26:39] church and the gates of hell should not
[1:26:41] Prevail against
[1:26:43] it it showed the gates of hell would be
[1:26:46] against
[1:26:48] it but could not Prevail for the Church
[1:26:51] of the Living God shall move
[1:26:56] on oh great Church of
[1:26:59] God who stands sprinkled today with his
[1:27:05] blood amen
[1:27:08] amen now I wanted to speak a little bit
[1:27:10] about
[1:27:11] uh the the name of our church
[1:27:17] Jericho and a little bit of how it came
[1:27:19] to to be
[1:27:23] Jericho the city uh dates back to 8,000
[1:27:31] BCE what year uh 8,000 before
[1:27:37] Christ it's known as the oldest city in
[1:27:39] the
[1:27:42] world if you Google the lowest city in
[1:27:45] the world in
[1:27:49] elevation it's Jericho
[1:27:53] sitting 258
[1:27:57] M or
[1:27:58] 846 ft below sea
[1:28:03] level near the Dead Sea which is the
[1:28:06] lowest point on
[1:28:11] Earth sitting at 1300t below sea
[1:28:18] level now we know Jesus came for the
[1:28:21] poor
[1:28:23] he came for the
[1:28:25] Brokenhearted he came for the
[1:28:28] Sinners that's the lowest of the low in
[1:28:33] class now if there's no no uh spiritual
[1:28:37] connection there with the
[1:28:42] Jericho I think you better open your
[1:28:45] eyes there's meaning behind the name of
[1:28:48] our
[1:28:51] church
[1:28:52] and uh as well as uh the Harlot
[1:28:56] Rahab has spiritual meaning
[1:29:01] too as we know she lived in
[1:29:05] Jericho and Joshua the warrior had sent
[1:29:08] his scouts
[1:29:13] out um and Jericho's rulers tried to
[1:29:17] apprehend
[1:29:19] them during scouting the land
[1:29:23] there in the city of
[1:29:25] Jericho and Rahab hid them in her
[1:29:29] house and helped them
[1:29:31] escape and return of her safety and her
[1:29:37] families that they would spare her life
[1:29:39] and her
[1:29:44] families and
[1:29:46] uh as you know uh uh here as well in in
[1:29:50] in our house here of Jericho
[1:29:55] Tabernacle it's a Dwelling Place of
[1:29:57] Escape for
[1:29:59] us where we can Worship the
[1:30:02] Lord for the sake of our
[1:30:05] Salvation a place where we can
[1:30:09] hide it's the same thing that happened
[1:30:11] there in with
[1:30:13] Rahab she she lived in
[1:30:16] Jericho you know and then as we know our
[1:30:19] co-founder brother Johnny Alvar
[1:30:23] which is sleeping in
[1:30:26] Christ and waiting to
[1:30:30] rise you know uh um the the the way our
[1:30:33] church came to
[1:30:35] be was uh our formal Church uh had made
[1:30:40] a a
[1:30:43] mistake and uh brother Johnny was uh put
[1:30:46] out of the
[1:30:48] church unjustly As We Know
[1:30:53] and and us as a people we stuck with the
[1:30:57] brother it took love and
[1:31:01] unity each and every one of you that
[1:31:03] came from that
[1:31:07] church you you you made a sacrifice too
[1:31:09] with
[1:31:11] him you know and and uh uh it takes the
[1:31:15] same thing for us to to make it home
[1:31:20] still we all need to stick
[1:31:23] together don't let anything
[1:31:26] change cuz that's what the devil
[1:31:30] wants he'd love to see
[1:31:33] division but he's not going to get
[1:31:37] it cuz we're the bride of
[1:31:40] Christ the people that will be
[1:31:44] raptured one glorious
[1:31:46] day now let me let me uh share the
[1:31:49] scripture that we uh we held faith F to
[1:31:52] with brother
[1:31:55] Johnny it's found in First Corinthians
[1:32:00] 12 verse 25- 27 we'll
[1:32:07] read that there should be no Schism in
[1:32:10] the body but that the members should
[1:32:12] have the same care one for
[1:32:20] another
[1:32:23] and whether one member suffer all the
[1:32:25] members suffer with it or one member be
[1:32:27] honored all the members Rejoice with
[1:32:37] it now you are the body of Christ and
[1:32:40] members in
[1:32:45] particular particular amen amen so we
[1:32:49] suffered with our precious brother
[1:32:53] we were able to discern right from
[1:32:56] wrong that's a unique special
[1:33:01] people that's the people we are still
[1:33:05] today that's the people that it'll take
[1:33:07] until we get
[1:33:10] home we need to remember
[1:33:13] that all that love and and and all that
[1:33:16] Unity that we
[1:33:18] have it needs to remain
[1:33:22] we need to continue
[1:33:25] fighting keeping our eyes on
[1:33:29] Calvary any new members that come into
[1:33:31] the
[1:33:35] church we're trying to have them be born
[1:33:39] again so that they can have their
[1:33:42] salvation so that we can all go
[1:33:45] home spend eternity
[1:33:50] together
[1:33:55] thank you Lord thank you now uh many
[1:33:58] times we may think that that this wasn't
[1:34:01] God's
[1:34:04] program in the way this church came to
[1:34:09] be but that is
[1:34:11] false and I I'll share with you
[1:34:15] why so every surrendered Soul that's
[1:34:19] come to this altar here
[1:34:24] every child every every
[1:34:27] baptism every married couple in this
[1:34:30] church every child
[1:34:34] presentation every new
[1:34:36] member and everyone's spiritual growth
[1:34:39] in this
[1:34:41] church has not been in
[1:34:44] vain but for the Lord's
[1:34:48] Glory that could never be taken back
[1:34:53] that was God's
[1:34:54] program you see where your brother
[1:34:56] stands
[1:34:58] today I believe I couldn't have
[1:35:00] accomplished where I'm at
[1:35:05] spiritually without this
[1:35:07] church without brother Johnny's
[1:35:11] suffering without us looking for this
[1:35:15] church I wouldn't be standing where I'm
[1:35:17] at spiritually with
[1:35:20] God I had stage
[1:35:25] fright
[1:35:27] nervousness I didn't even like to be
[1:35:29] around
[1:35:31] people but in this very spot
[1:35:35] here I surrendered to the
[1:35:39] Lord I became a prisoner of
[1:35:43] God I told Jesus Christ here I
[1:35:47] am Emmanuel prayed for
[1:35:50] me I walked back drunk off the Holy
[1:35:52] Spirit as I've explained
[1:35:56] before and now I just ain't the same no
[1:35:59] more now that can happen to you if you
[1:36:02] think you don't have the Holy
[1:36:05] Ghost I believe he's here
[1:36:07] today I believe he's here to bless
[1:36:11] you believest thou
[1:36:13] this he can restore anyone that needs
[1:36:16] anything from
[1:36:18] him believest thou this
[1:36:21] he's
[1:36:23] alive he's the same yesterday today and
[1:36:27] forever he doesn't come out of his
[1:36:30] program we leave his
[1:36:33] program don't look at the
[1:36:36] messenger look at the
[1:36:39] message when you begin to look at
[1:36:42] men is when you begin to
[1:36:44] fail don't look at the gift look at The
[1:36:48] Giver of the
[1:36:50] gift Jesus Christ is here to bless
[1:36:53] you Jesus Christ is here to restore the
[1:36:55] joy of your
[1:36:58] salvation man can't do nothing for
[1:37:01] you I can't give you
[1:37:04] anything there's nothing good in me I
[1:37:07] will fail my words will fail but Jesus
[1:37:11] Christ won't
[1:37:12] fail he laid the foundation
[1:37:15] already it's our duty to keep up with
[1:37:18] him to keep looking towards Calvary
[1:37:22] not let the devil step
[1:37:24] in we need to secure our
[1:37:27] camp love one
[1:37:29] another like if you were going home
[1:37:32] tomorrow because the minute you get a
[1:37:34] bitterness towards your
[1:37:36] brother you don't know if your heart
[1:37:38] attack can hit you
[1:37:42] there you can go home and not make it
[1:37:47] home God doesn't allow sinners in his
[1:37:50] kingdom
[1:37:54] we can't we can't go home after we've
[1:37:56] done something
[1:37:58] bad we won't make it we need to love all
[1:38:02] our
[1:38:03] Brethren put aside all
[1:38:06] indifferences any gossip that you
[1:38:10] hear you know what brother Johnny would
[1:38:12] have
[1:38:13] said that's garbage you throw that out

[1:38:22] all your
[1:38:23] heart he's here to give you the Holy
[1:38:25] Ghost if you have
[1:38:27] need not man man can't do that for
[1:38:31] you the word corrects the
[1:38:35] man it's not
[1:38:37] man it's the
[1:38:39] word that is what brings us where we're
[1:38:42] at that is what brings courage into the
[1:38:46] man when he steps into
[1:38:48] Christ when that light comes into man
[1:38:52] he's no longer the same he can talk
[1:38:55] before the
[1:38:56] crowd he can let them know that he has
[1:38:58] found
[1:39:00] Christ and that he's done with the
[1:39:03] world there's nothing good for us out
[1:39:06] there as I said before you turn
[1:39:09] back you may turn into that pillar of
[1:39:11] salt like Lot's
[1:39:14] wife Jesus Christ loves
[1:39:17] you he's always loved you it pleased God
[1:39:22] to to rip his son apart for

[1:39:34] joy so that we can have
