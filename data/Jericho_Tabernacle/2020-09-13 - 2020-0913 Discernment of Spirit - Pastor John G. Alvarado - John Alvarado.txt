of god give us of your spirit lord we just place ourselves in your hands everything that i said in that may be according to the word of god [Music] and we pray that whatever your hearts desire whatever you have in your mind may god grant to your desire we know that we're living in a terrible time but at the same time we're living in the most glorious times in the coming of the lord jesus christ it's it's hard and sad to say that we are living at the end time we're living in a time when end was time will cease and we're just going back to eternity because we came from eternity but we're going back to eternity well there will be no more sorrow sickness disappointments we'll be with him our our savior the lord jesus christ how many love him today quantus and now that's easy to say it is the bible tells us the man should live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god now us who understand the plan of redemption a process and a requirement for us to go back to eternity and that is that we have to believe every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god we have to be obedient and to get there are certain requirements today i would like to speak to you a little bit about something that's very simple i could say it in 10 minutes but you know brother branham was very long-winded i don't know how people did it back in those time maybe because we were living in a different time i don't know but brother brown preached two or three hours sometimes and now today well it's hard for somebody to sit down and hear tape for one hour we're so restless and desperate we got to go do this and this this the other and no we what we must do i would like to present my own ideas but my ideas my thoughts it's it's trash no good it's got to be according to what god has brought us today and this time the thoughts of god brought to a prophet and he spoke to us you know but uh some of you might question what i say where did you get that from that question wow it's my style oh there's music i'm made up you know brother baby says just be yourself i don't ever try to be like nobody else i think people will take you accept you better yo yourself if you're like really mickey mouse you know but people admire that you are that you are what you are or somebody is trying to prove a point or something you know and trying to really glorify themselves what is our principal theme what is this principal to raise raise up a man raise up a church a creed an idea an idea our principal theme principal is to raise up jesus christ and nobody is better than anybody else and everybody has this place likewise in the mystical body of jesus christ right i understand so what we want to do today is we want to look at god's plan is i think that's one of the main things right now that is really working on the human race is a certain decision should i buy this house or that house should i go to this church should i go to that church uh should i do this business transaction or that business transactions i when i picked my wife i had to discern it if this was going to be the right one for me or not yes now i already knew that there were certain qualifications qualifications but you know really really um i think i made the right choice well i've been married 46 years ago and i've been very happy for 46 years now i don't know about her but me i'm fine i understand now i had to use a little bit of discernment there right all right tuberculosis i picked the right one because it was all nothing but the grace of god just the grace of god so you pick the right woman the right wife you do this right and that right whatever you do right it's the grace of god and sometimes we make mistakes in life we don't discern things very good we do wrong a wrong choice and then we pay the consequences but it's still the grace of god but i believe that brother branham tells us to avoid the least amount of problems we need to discern things i know as human beings we're all a mess jose como somanos tosun because he to overcome he took on time el tomor before the foundation of the world no merits no nothing is not what you did it's just the grace of god the predestination of god let's get a little focus here and express to you the thought that i have today and i'm going to tell it this way discernment of spirit de espirito brother brown preach the message to sermon of spirit element how many you've heard that tape that's what i want to talk about a little bit today so let's go into some of the scriptures the scripture that it seems like it didn't even like a demon have anything with to do with that message but i believe it's got everything to do with that message but strong meat belongs to them that are of full age even those who by reason abuse have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil abuse have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil you know everything we do in life we need to discern it but unconsciously we still keep doing the bad things don't take nice steps and then before you you find yourself inside of a web in a spider web so tangled up and say wait a minute how did i get myself in this fix in this situation you took too many steps the situation and that's the way a lot of people are they get themselves in trouble how did i get in this mask you didn't process it but the word of god is some people don't even know how to discern between good and whatever still walmart home depot wherever i go home depot and i see so many naked women well semi have naked women anyway even men lost men without pants on hombres in pantalones and they cat discerned inopened kind of a spirit they have okay classes why would a woman want to walk around almost half nude and show her body to other men you know like a free happy-go-lucky anything's allowed yep it's okay and then they walk around with shorts and you know you have to turn your head carnal oh no or is it something that just what we we go by the eyesight now turned over first corinthians 2 12 and 13. now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit of which is of god how many can say amen to them how many believe if we have received the spirit of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god they're freely given comparing spiritual things with spiritual acomodando spiritual allah spiritual you gotta have a spiritual lie in this age this is the most deceiving age that ever existed but the natural man receives not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolish unto him neither can they know them [Music] wow that's so awesome to me you know some people just don't get it is my objective i'm only trying to do one thing brothers my purpose in being in this message is not to glorify myself no is the glory i want to lift up is in the church today is crying to the people what i have gathered and when you see separation and i mean you tell me if that doesn't exist in this message all right you know we're supposed to be one big church am you know i've gone down to mexico mexico and there's hundreds of churches iglesias and none of them fellowship one with the others because of doctrine let is they believe in the return ministry of the prophet of god but i think it's ridiculous because brother bottom explains to us the road map and the road and the points that you have to go to different points amen amen even if you pull out your gp whatever you call it you got to come back to the word of god okay now when you see separation and differences and brotherhood broken up and christian life if jesus did let's try to follow this road map here now let's hear what brother baum says in the message discernment of spirits you're trying to achieve something a true prophet of god a true teacher is now if you believe what brother brown said you believe what i'm telling you what i'm reading to you what he said a true teacher is trying to bring the church to a unity of spirits a unity of spirit um trying to achieve it no matter what denomination they belong to what about it to see if it be the spirit of god or not talking there johnny alvarado johnny alvarado that's what the prophet of god is telling what is he telling us the unity of the spirit now there's not two men in the world that will agree on everything how many knew that me and my wife don't even agree on everything there's many people here that don't agree with me and i don't agree with you but does that give us the rights for me to this fellowship with you that i can ask a brother to come into our church even though he might believe something different than me now if it's way way off and he's trying to bring to you that there's three gods i know there's a filter there and it's going to be it's only to a certain limit but if the brother is a precious a brother of like precious faith and he doesn't agree with everything that i agree with and he comes up here and he says something different brother johnny what are you doing hey i would have enough enough discernment you'll know that his attitude his discernment is only trying to glorify god what is the principal theme what is the lima principal jesus christ jesus christ living amongst us okay now i i could say something there but let let's go under the next quorum and you bear with me here in the spirit see whether it is of god or not see whether it acts like him when you know you're as innocent as you can be oh my god what is this you remember that little benjamite kicked up dirt against david patio do you remember that david said okay leave so if somebody kicks up something about you accuses you falsely accuses you of this i don't want nothing to do with you i'm separating myself from your serpents brother branham says decent amount of god allows these things to come on us there's people here i personally that argue uh and uh dis dispute the one monks together okay well she's like this yeah he's like that ellie's a seed he's got and you just stand there and take it now and you know that you've got the spirit of god i said that australian i'm saying it again always wanted to separate himself from abraham even when he went into sodom and gomorrah abraham went after him no matter what your brother does against you important against the contra freedom oh my god jesus is right mr johnny look johnny you did it you did it you're gonna pay for this you're gonna pay the consequences there's no there's no brothers the moment they get careless i'll sack them i'll just look for that one chance to be able to kick him as a mule we don't think like that huh don't try to act mean towards them don't curse them now we're following a road map here we want to follow the word of god don't curse them you need an altar you need to repent of it doesn't make any difference what they do to you what they do to us don't curse them listen to what brother baum says look at that look at the steps we have to take the road roadmap knowing that god did that to give you a test to see how you take it he'll have to come to it anyhow see in life life is to school and all the time things are coming at us god wants to see the image of god in your life you're scared of it like making the christian soul it's like a diamond it's rough it's dirty it's hospital it's got to be beat until it reflects he didn't want a fight he wanted everybody to be in harmony and love each other was a man that reflected the spirit of christ was brother proud and i know that refers to the prophet of god and it refers to the church of god and i said brother schism is that the am i saying that word right schism yeah am i saying that brother to answer your question i said now i do not take either sides with you brother la pregunta you know album and i know how long and i know as long as you fuss you're both wrong so if we fight to see peliamos wow brother johnny you're making it really hard on me this this is not my plan i've said it before now say it again real quick when god permitted their whole world to fall i'll do it on my own i'm not going to die for that guy but that's the human being that's the cardinal got god's plan that death brings life tried vida then he came down himself and if you are an attribute of god you will have the same characteristics as god to die to yourself now to answer your question i do not take either sides with you brethren and i know as long as you fast you're both wrong because i would rather be wrong in my doc right in my heart right in my doctrine and wrong in my heart i said after all it's your heart's condition hey man how beautiful that is huh make it it's a condition of your heart you love everyone we try to stay within the word of god now now i'm going to insert a little bit of doctrine here and then when i say this i know some people on online turn them off now i don't want to hear no more i've heard them say the message is very extensive there's this this this this ex but there's certain doctrinal points that brother brown said that that are more scandalous people get all about like uptight or freaked out oh i don't believe that i don't believe that no no no okay and i've expressed a lot of my thoughts yes a lot of those people are already gone some of them already dead or they left the church or they went somewhere else and a new group came up so they don't really know me but a lot of times people judge me but what they the the covering of the book and i'm going to tell you what i believe i believe sent a message that is my absolute absolute messenger that's what i believe if i die tomorrow it doesn't make any difference i believe this message it gives us eternal life let's not be that it gives us the baptism of the holy ghost gives you power to overcome but i've been saying what you cannot overcome because he overcome for you do you know him today in the power of his resurrection see what joshua of this day is going reading or hearing the messages it's not like reading a newspaper you have to read in between the lines because it's a love letter to the bride of jesus christ it was a love see what joshua of this day is going to be now we know there was a joshua back there right they took him to the promised land and we know brother brown the things he said of the pillar of fire of the holy ghost he used moses to bring him out of the world he used the great warrior joshua but they're also included but the main guy brother brown said i have been given the joshua commission brother branham has the joshua commissioner see what a joshua of a church spiritually it's going to be josue see how he adds that into that right there it's the same kind of a joshua josue they had in a church the believers brother is giving us a message here as i was with moses so will i be with thee joshua josue and as i was with joshua come on freak on josue with you william marion brandon contigo william branham read the message of what he says that's part of the problem people people don't hear tapes where he belongs on the correspondent divided that line exactly a very beautiful type today what we need a joshua for today wants god gives one man the the the spirit or the gift of wisdom everybody wants to have the gift of wisdom one man they have the gift of healing everybody wants to have the gift of me too many copycats no more originals you know elvis presley was the king of rock and roll elvis presley the rock and roll he was original right and now what you got millions of copycats i think people will respect me more if they see that i'm genuine sincere joseph branham jose branham does not take the place of william bradley no oh cupa lugar de william branham one message is one messenger oh mensa um even joseph bran told me himself we have one leader the seventh angel massachusetts to show that you have the evidence of the holy ghost did and i say god sent the seventh angel in this age now i believe you can have an experiment that god had not speak in tongues i know people that didn't do anything and i they're a real genuine christian christian amen amen but god has said in the church we want to make them all speaking we want to make them all run the brother said he saw me but you got to believe every word that proceeds out of separated them by spiritual discernment i placed them into the body there they remained and became the cream of the earth spiritual you're going to find yourself in the woods well how did i end up here that's what happened to eve he was naked running around the woods oh well what happened here she got out of the word don't you dare get out of the word now the method in the baptism they were both represented in the sons of isaac isa and many times many of us that's that's the kind of person we pick but jacob had discernment he knew that birthright meant everything elsa significant didn't make any difference that's a spiritual man today is amen hallelujah manifestants they're jealous of you that's the spirit of the devil that's what cain had in the beginning stand firm but i say feel me stop abraham detent abram god will drive you to the point god will require you to do something so hard in your life have to be put in that position that will overcome all the adverse everything that comes against her she will stand on the word of god amen as human beings we're not good brother no even brother branham was a liar you're a liar i'm alive i believe that he the name of the lord jesus christ jesus thank you lord jesus there's so many people when you get amongst just like men like that the people that from different churches iglesias they're not spiritual enough okay spirituality to catch the discernment of it they don't get it no no captain they like to laugh praise the lord together we stand i want to have fellowship with all the churches i don't want churches divided but i'll tell you one thing right now algorithm i've invited brothers to come to this church where do you get that from uh why why do you hate me i pray i proclaim the message of william branham your pregnant mom and sacrifice excuse me not the message of willing the pressures of god the message of god discovered sent to william brothers william branham brought to this age for a bribe together we stand and divided we fall juntos is to come man i wish i could run right now i wish i was 20 years old i want to run 100 yard dash stimulation of revelation a revelation god bless your heart sister pilate that you have stood on the word let's believe the main principles creamos los principios principales what is the main principle what is the principle well i believe the return ministry of regression return ministry is only part of the message if you don't live the life you say i can't believe the return ministry you ain't gonna call in the rapture for the bride el morio he died for the foolish virgin he died for the bride he died for the fully virgin version they have eternal the seal of the baptism of the holy ghost is that upon the prize i know some of you didn't understand what i just said keep breathing brother keep reading attributes of his the presence of the holy spirit how many believe that if a man comes to have a great gift no matter if he belongs to our denomination or another dimension don't judge him in trouble mainly because i speak too much and it's time for me to get down let's just say for an example we did this if i did that may god forgive me okay fine don't judge him by what denomination he come from how he dresses but what you want to see is what he's trying to do with that gift what purpose he has proposed if he's trying to take his influence and build himself a great name no matter how great a teacher he is wow and how many of us fall for that i have josie i've i've listened to preachers in messages then how powerful he is if he isn't trying to achieve something for the benefit of the body of christ your own spiritual discernment will tell you that's wrong to that don't say you haven't but what is his purpose your own spiritual name would tell you that's wrong no matter how accurate you could preach a message and even be perfect you see the body of jesus christ you're just trying to glorify yourself that goes for me first you know the word of the sword but remember don't forget the angel had already eaten the book before john did it because john represents the bride juan represents but the seventh angel represents the head of the bride wow how did i jump to the next code my god it's time to get down brother johnny hey come on what time it is are you tired how many want to take a jog with me right now if a brother asks you for a favor run with me a mile yeah we'll run another mile no no you don't know her no no not me that's what i'm asking join me right now and unite yourself with me right now and that's what we've tried to do for two thousand years and you will see the spirit of christ upon you if a man is wrong if you can't love your enemies the same as you love those who love you you're no better off than the publicans that's right that's what the church has failed to get esverdat yes and i hope you get it tonight i hope you can see what i'm talking about please said how many didn't understand what i said it's very simple we got to love each other brothers no matter if the person doesn't love you no importance be kind and sweet to everybody just be a christian can you start playing the piano you know to me what the greatest achievement a person
