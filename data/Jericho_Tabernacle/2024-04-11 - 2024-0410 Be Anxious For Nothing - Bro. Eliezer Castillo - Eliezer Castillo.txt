be amongst each and every person here so that we can give God the honor and the glory if You' like to turn with me to Philippians pH chapter 4 verse 6 and [Music] 7 I I have just a little thought this evening if God willing I won't be keeping you too long the Bible it says be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God and the peace of God the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus let us bow our heads oh Heavenly Father what a privilege it is to be here in your presence once more father Lord that we can come and make you the sent center of our life Lord we come here with expectation father from the beginning to the end of the service knowing that father we are not Conjuring up any emotion or trying to bring anything up father but we're here to meet a supernatural being we're here to meet our God our living Jesus Christ and my prayer is Lord that you make yourself known to your people that you may just give a spirit of Faith within each and every person Lord that we may leave here father is stronger though the world is falling into pieces Lord father we can stand on that rock we can stand in your word in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask all these things Lord have the preeminence name of Jesus Christ we pray am amen and amen amen amen amen you may be seated am so Philippians 4 6 and 7 he says be careful for nothing be careful for nothing that means don't worry for everything or be anxious for nothing because the peace of God see there's many peace out there many people are looking for peace in the world but this peace is a peace of God that passes all understanding that we don't understand this piece see worries they come up in our lives we're all prone to be worriers we're all prone to have problems in life to where we can't help but to worry but here Paul is telling us he says do not be in a perpetual state of worry or anxiety see we worry we'll worry about the bills one day we'll worry about our children the next but where the devil wants to keep us at is in a state of anxiety where we don't allow the Holy Spirit to move that's that's where the devil wants the world today see see the Bible says that there is a time for everything Brothers there's there is a time to be happy there's a time for war there's a time to be sad believe it or not I'm sure there's a time to worry too I'm sure there's a time to be concerned about things but where the devil gets us at is is whenever we we don't allow that time to stop because every time it has an end to that time but but if we allow sadness to continue on in our lives if we allow mourning over a loved one continue in our lives it becomes depression see we we're all sad we all get sad we're all worried about certain things but if the devil can continue or or allow us to continue in that that's when the the spirits come upon us and and a body full of worry brother bam says it's the Avenue of sickness brother brandham most of his prayer lines Brothers I'm not sure I asked brother Emanuel in the back but brother Brandon preached over a thousand over 1100 messages and in those 1100 messages in those prayer lines over 1700 [Music] times brother brandham would would discern somebody and and he would say yeah yeah you have a a heart problem Oh you you have ulcers in your stomach oh you you have back pain but but what's causing this is your nervous condition it it it was their nervousness causing their body to get into a state of sickness brother bam says that this whole world is plagued with that well nobody nobody absolutely nobody is saved from this brother Bram says we're living in a neurotic age where there's nervous tension all around brother Bram he he tells a story of this little a little lamb once he was there in Africa looking at his binoculars and and he saw a little sheep leave the Corral and as that sheep began to go out into the field over there in the field it has long yellow grass that that little sheep begin to get a little nervous see in that sheep something began to happen inside of that sheep a nervousness came up and and he begin he begin to scream out that little sh and brother Bram says why is this sheep so nervous even the the little lamb the little sheep didn't even know why it was nervous and brother Bram said it was because there was a great big yellow man lion behind those that that grass and and he didn't know it was behind him he just sensed that something was wrong he knew something something was about to take place and and brothers that brother Bram says that is the condition of the world today the the world doesn't know what to do because of these Eclipse that happened you see in the news how people are buying this and buying that running around nervous why because something is fixing to happen brother brandham says the world is just built up in pressure it's built up upon pressure brother Bram says he said and it's going to blow up one of these days the world is built full of pressure and the doctors don't know what to do about it the psychiatrist has got uh psychiatrist doctoring them that's right they don't have the answer but God does God has the answer to all of this see the world is built up in pressure the outside your your outside uh environment it's building up in pressure whether it's your work whether it's it's in your family life wherever it might be there's pressure everywhere and and because of that just like the little sheep just BEC because there's an outside presence or an outside pressure it causes a nervousness inside it causes anxiety inside of our lives so so we're all all of us we're in this little pressurized bubble called the world and we're all subject to some sort of worry or anxiety brother brandham said each age had its pressures he said for example the great burden of this last age is the pressure of riches soft living nervous tensions in a complex age that we seem unfit to live in so that that's the pressure for this age and a few years that a few years ago they they made a study concerning married men and the study it it revealed or the conclusion was that the number one worry or stress in the married man in America was money that that one little thing it'll stress and put stress over every single man here why because the very time they say I do in the altar that it puts a a charge or a burden on them to where how am I going to have the ability to care or provide for my family and and and there's going there's pressures everywhere every single person has an anxiety of something and that's the one of the that's the devil's attack or his greatest attack on the Christian it's it's not trying to get you to smoke or drink or do all those other things brother we're past that we're past those things trying us to get to disbelieve the the word or or or the message or something like that but the way he he tries us tries to get us to disbelieve he will attack us on fear and worry he will we he will put an anxiety over a Christian in 2 Timothy 1:7 it says for God hath not given us the spirit of fear God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power love and A sound mind he did not give us a spirit he gives us his holy spirit but but but rest assured brothers that Spirit isn't just or I mean uh fear isn't just an emotion but it's a spirit God did not give us that spirit but the devil does he'll give us that spirit of fear he'll he'll do that so that it because it combats or or it attacks our faith fear is the devil and it's the enemy to our faith it directly contradicts the word brother brandham says in the in perfect Faith now now he's going to talk about job job was a perfect man there there was nothing that you could put on job and say he's wrong on this but but brother Bram says this he says in the Book of Job it says here job feared and what what he feared actually happened what brought it what brought the thing that actually happened his fear that's what made it happen his faith would have kept him from it but his fear brought him him brought it to him he was scared it was going to happen and it did happen now if he know it wouldn't happen or it it wouldn't happen see what I mean so his his own fear his own worry his own anxiety was the one thing that brought the thing he was scared of to pass and and that fear it's caused by the belief the expectation the anticipation of that something is bad is going to happen it's the negative of faith see I've always when I would hear that quote I'd hear Brother Bron say this and I understood that the devil he is powerless without us he can't do nothing without you he he's just a fly on the wall but if if he can allow you to use your own faith against the word then he will allow you or cause you to create things that are negative in your life by our own faith by our own worry fear and faith are the Opposites it's the an anticipation that something horrible is going to happen there was there was one time when the the disciples and Jesus were on the ship and brother brandham says that Devils were on each side in those waves he was going to turn that boat over he was going to try to eliminate those people and and and the disciples were so scared so fearful of their lives that that's how we are sometimes in our lives when storms happen when troubles happen in our lives we're so afraid of what is to come we're so afraid of something that is not even real it hasn't even taken place yet see fear is and worry and anxiety is all future problems they're all tomorrow problems that we're worrying about but the devil will say yes this is the greatest problem that you're ever going to face and maybe it is and maybe maybe we'll die tomorrow but Brothers Jesus was in the ship Jesus was in that ship the Bible brother Bram says a ship means Fellowship two men in one ship and brother if you have Christ in your heart if you have Christ in your life why worry why worry the the the one that will cause the sea to stop is here Brothers Let's the storm robot let the things happen as long as Jesus is in the ship that's all we care about that's all that matters to me personally where is Jesus they were so scared they woke him up they said Lord Lord we're about to die and you don't even care he probably wiped the tears off of his eyes as he barely woke up he got in the the Helm of the ship and he said peace be still and as easy as that was he he didn't have to get worked up in a Pentecostal uh spirit Brothers he didn't have to yell and yell and yell at that water he said peace be still and that se knew who its maker was and he turned to his beloved disciples and he said why are you afraid why are you so fearful I believe God would ask us the same thing as as the whole world as our world is C crumbling around us why are you so fearful and he right after he says that why are you so fearful he says H how is it that you have no faith see he used both of them right together in the same sentence because fear is the absence of Faith fear is saying Lord I I Love You Lord but I don't know if you can do it I don't know if you're capable of taking over this situation and he's saying why are you so fearful I believe it's in Matthew or Luke he says oh ye of little faith our anxiety is the lack of trust in God and that that he is under control that he is has everything under control me as a child I know we could all testify of this but my father he had this blue van we weren't the richest in in the block we weren't the richest in the church so he had he had this blue van that he he would get all five of us kids and we would go from Phoenix to Texas wherever they wanted to go and yes there was times that we'd break down in the middle of nowhere and I'm sure my father he was stressed I'm sure he was trying to figure out every which way to get this going at that time we didn't have cell phones we we were just waiting for a a good pedestrian to stop and and help us out but brother did that bother me I was in the back playing with my toys I was in the back getting hungry saying I'm hungry I I was thinking okay this is a time for us to rest our feet and and play around in the side this is not my problem that sounds like dad's problem because it's it's a dad kind of problem and and I think to myself stop meddling with dad's problems I have to tell myself every once in a while stop meddling with Father's problems the things that I can't control in my life the things that that I I have no control to to fix or or to make it worse it's a god kind of problem it reminds me of Whenever there was that the child with his father in in Egypt or in Goan and the word of the Lord went forth to the land and and it said that the death angel would come and strike the land and kill every firstborn in that land but God gave the children of Israel a promise Brothers there's going to be trials there's going to be death Angels coming our way but God always gives us a promise God always gives us a way out God gave them away and and said put the blood on the lentil of the door and the father that's what he did faithfully and the son he began to hear the screams on the other side and he said dad do you love me yeah I love you son well am I not your first boy yes you are my firstborn he says look there dad the angel he got that little boy there I know him I played with him Oh Daddy here he comes says here he comes towards the house he says but son do you see that door post right there do you see that blood on that door post he said Daddy will will he get me will the angel get me he said no he can't get you why because God gave us a promise the death angel the problem the things they can't get us why father has gotten toen care of all the things no wonder the psalm psalmist David says though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I fear no evil why don't I fear why cuz I'm big and strong why because I'll take it over myself no because thou art with me Lord thy rod and thy staff they come for me brother I need to stop meddling with father's business the the most uh command the the the Commandment that Jesus said the most as I'm closing he says it wasn't do not steal he he he said do not do this or do not do that he said do not be afraid and that commandment is the the Commandment most often looked at in the Bible do not be afraid there's a reason why that that commandment is is the most out of everyone because we're prone to be afraid we're prone to have fears and problems and this is not going to take away your issues out there in John 14:27 Jesus says now now this is this is right before Jesus gives his life on the cross this man that has all the world in his shoulders he has my sins and he has your sins he has my worries he has my problems yet he could still say peace I leave with you peace I leave with you my peace my peace I give unto you not as the world give it I give it to you let your heart not be troubled neither Let It Be Afraid my coworker he wants asked me he said if you could do anything to help this world out if you had the power to do it what would you do now that this very silly question I asked him what would you do he said I would create world peace I said how would you do that exactly well I would I would fix this with the police and that and and and all the wars I would get all the presidents together I would do this and I would do that and I would fix the park and I would do this Brothers the source of war the source of turmoil it's not going to be fixed outwardly it's not going to be fixed by by fixing the roads it's not going to be fixed by by running away from our problems it's not going to be fixed by going here and going there peace starts here you want world peace peace starts in here he says peace I give unto thee not as the world gives it see the world will try to give you peace but let me tell you what let me burst that bubble it's going to build more pressure in your life the drinking the smoking all of those things it creates more unstableness in our lives so how would Christ give us peace well not as the world gives it because the world they'll give you peace but it will be taken away once a little trial comes up once you wake up in the morning all of those issues are back with you he says let not your heart be trouble that's where our peace is at and founded at it starts in here where where no matter if the situation continues if if everything breaks around you nobody wants to talk to one another your family is in shambles you don't know how you're going to pay the bill next month you don't know how how you're going to do this or your what's going to happen here brother it's going to be there tomorrow this peace is not to fix all those things this piece isn't to fix whatever this piece is to give give you a quiet and a sound heart that you can understand though I am in Tribulation though I am in Trials though I don't feel good Lord thou art with me Lord Lord you are with me no matter what God is with us that is the source of our peace that is the reason why I'm a Christian today can't you say Amen to that why are you a Christian why do you come to church why do you want to serve him it's because him it's because when everybody is around or when nobody's watching he is with me no matter what where whether there's good days and bad days I have peace in my life let us stand to our feet brother brother brandham he says as the musicians come up he says now my poor dejected friend he says if you are here and don't know that I'm a witness that that's the truth I'm now this is Brother brandham here brother brandham he he wasn't he he wasn't uh protected from all of these things he went through exactly what we gone through and Jesus specially went through what we went through brother brandham he says I'm a nervous and upset person Irish on both sides and they're nervous and drunk my mother is a half Indian would would which would actually um by birth make me a renegade he said that's right oh I'd be a terrible person if it wasn't for the Lord where would we be at in this same message he carth for you he said if I wasn't a Christian he said I'd be a suicide case the prophet of the hour saying that but he's not a prophet just because he's he's William Mary and brandom but he needed Christ in his life to activate every gift Brothers if we didn't have Christ in our lives where would we be at we would be faking a good happy life somewhere maybe drinking in a club or something maybe we' be living a more righteous life than Christians do but without Christ we're poor and miserable he says oh I'd be a terrible person but what happened I found something that took the little room in me to to give peace that passes all understanding and I've come from Death unto life from Darkness unto [Music] light oh you could never deny that that's my life that's all if you believe that today let us raise our hands if you want that in your life raise your hand to God Brothers he's here cast all your cares upon Him cast all your anxiety upon him cast all of your worry all of your doubt all of your problems all of your issues cast it upon him oh Heavenly Father Lord you see the hands this evening father Lord It's a declaration father Lord that that either you we have you in our lives or we need more of you in our lives father I ask that you give each and every person here in this building tonight and all those that are watching Lord give them your spirit Lord take the spirit of fear away and whatever might happen Lord that we are are anchored in you and not anchored in ourselves that our peace comes from you and not an outside Source [Music] father bless them Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen you God be with you [Music] K
