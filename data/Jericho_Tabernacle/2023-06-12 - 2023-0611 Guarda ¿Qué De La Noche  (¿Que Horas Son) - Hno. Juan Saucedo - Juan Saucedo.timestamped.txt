[54:18] [Music]
[54:20] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[54:23] amen amen
[54:25] you may be seated Brothers
[54:35] I want to say that I'm very happy this
[54:37] morning
[54:40] because I know a mighty God
[54:46] I know that a God that throughout 46
[54:49] years
[54:50] I've seen him how he works
[54:55] I've seen how he's taken us forward
[55:00] he's taking care of us along the way
[55:06] the other day just this week
[55:11] Flagstaff I was drawing driving towards
[55:14] Flagstaff
[55:15] on the I-17
[55:19] 65 miles per hour
[55:25] that's the the advice that our pastor
[55:27] has given us
[55:29] and it's with me
[55:32] every time I get into my work truck I
[55:36] remember it
[55:38] if we are speeding
[55:42] problems we can get into trouble with
[55:45] the authorities
[55:47] but if we drive at the speed limit then
[55:51] we're fine
[55:55] if we drive three four miles below the
[55:59] speed limit
[56:00] then it's even better for us
[56:04] but here I was going at 60 files with
[56:07] the heavy load
[56:09] and then all of a sudden uh one of my
[56:11] back tires
[56:16] you can tell I was really scared
[56:20] it doesn't matter that I've been driving
[56:22] for 40 years
[56:24] but you can just imagine that the how
[56:27] scared I was
[56:28] and the people that were behind me as
[56:31] well
[56:34] only Gods watches over us
[56:38] I just pulled over
[56:43] and I said Lord
[56:47] this could have been worse
[56:53] I could have
[56:58] easily gone off the road
[57:01] but undoubtedly you're very good to us
[57:05] and your grace is still with us
[57:11] that's why I love my church and
[57:13] appreciate him he's my everything
[57:15] I live for him
[57:18] I give him the honor and the glory
[57:21] because throughout my entire life
[57:25] ever since I yielded and surrendered
[57:28] myself
[57:29] I've seen his hand how he's taking care
[57:31] of me he's protected me
[57:34] one time I was shot with the gun
[57:38] I could hear how the the bullets were
[57:40] just passing by but they didn't hit me
[57:45] they knocked me off the motorcycle that
[57:48] I was on
[57:50] but I I got up I picked it up and I
[57:53] started it and I left
[57:55] that's the mission field
[57:57] sometimes
[57:59] things happen on the mission field
[58:03] so that we can give him the honor and
[58:06] the glory for it
[58:39] every time I see something that I
[58:41] shouldn't
[58:44] you can see it because you're driving
[58:48] the people out in the streets
[58:52] you can imagine that at four in the
[58:54] morning
[58:57] there's women literally running on the
[59:00] streets
[59:02] doing exercise
[59:06] and that's fine there's nothing wrong
[59:08] with working out
[59:09] but at four in the morning
[59:14] with special clothing to be able to run
[59:18] what they call special apparel
[59:21] La Cruz but that's when I can see the
[59:25] cross that I have with me so glory to
[59:28] God's name
[59:39] because we know who is the one that is
[59:42] watching over us
[59:43] blessed be the name of the Lord
[59:46] if you can please stand with me
[59:50] we'll be reading a scripture
[59:55] [Music]
[59:57] we'll be reading in
[59:59] Isaiah but do you know chapter 21
[1:00:03] verse 11. foreign
[1:00:32] it's not easy
[1:00:38] you can see the church today is a full
[1:00:40] house
[1:00:42] it's not an easy job for my brother
[1:00:49] whenever we want to criticize him
[1:00:54] just uh imagine you're in his shoes for
[1:00:56] one week
[1:00:58] just look at this
[1:01:01] it's a big responsibility

[1:02:33] we're going to speak we're going to

[1:02:39] my brother Emmanuel did an excellent job
[1:02:41] on Friday okay
[1:02:47] for those that weren't able to be here
[1:02:49] Friday I recommend that you go watch it
[1:02:51] it was recorded
[1:02:53] I I listen to him
[1:02:56] then I go to where I have to go
[1:03:00] and then I always put time aside to hear
[1:03:03] it again
[1:03:04] it was a tremendous message that we were
[1:03:07] spoken to on Friday
[1:03:09] it says
[1:03:11] Romans 13 11. yes
[1:03:16] foreign
[1:03:24] and that knowing the time that is now is
[1:03:27] high time to wake out of sleep for now
[1:03:30] is our Salvation nearer than what we
[1:03:32] believed
[1:03:34] Hermanos amen Brothers
[1:03:38] [Music]
[1:03:48] the night is far spent the day is at
[1:03:51] hand let us therefore cast off the works
[1:03:53] of darkness and let us put on the armor
[1:03:56] of lightestamente
[1:04:01] is
[1:04:09] let us walk honestly as in the day not
[1:04:12] in writing and drunkenness not in
[1:04:14] chambering and wantonness not in strife
[1:04:17] and envying
[1:04:26] La carne
[1:04:28] which it says in verse 14 but put ye on
[1:04:31] the Lord Jesus Christ and make not
[1:04:33] provision for the flesh to fulfill the
[1:04:36] lust thereof is you may be seated
[1:04:39] Brothers
[1:04:41] may God bless us this morning
[1:04:47] preached on Friday it is
[1:04:53] he said your faith it activates
[1:04:55] something
[1:04:58] your faith activates God's power
[1:05:02] so this morning I'm praying and
[1:05:05] beseeching
[1:05:09] that the faith that he's pouring over us
[1:05:14] can activate then something in US
[1:05:18] it can activate our faith
[1:05:20] Lord to his name
[1:05:24] when faith is activated
[1:05:27] whatever you ask for is then received
[1:05:33] When Faith is activated whatever you ask
[1:05:35] for is
[1:05:38] but Faith must be activated
[1:05:42] you have to pray and ask for it
[1:05:46] you must have that Faith
[1:05:51] many times we ask ourselves how can we
[1:05:54] have the brothers to have that faith
[1:05:57] we can't do nothing of ourselves
[1:06:00] [Music]
[1:06:01] but he can do it
[1:06:05] because he's the faith Giver so
[1:06:11] and James says if anyone does not have
[1:06:14] it or if anyone's lacking Faith
[1:06:16] ask him of it
[1:06:19] demand it from him
[1:06:21] pray it to him
[1:06:24] and he will give it to you
[1:06:28] when that faith is inactivated
[1:06:31] when you hear the word of God
[1:06:34] which was what the brother preached to
[1:06:37] us
[1:06:38] when God's word is
[1:06:42] and the word is falling on fertile
[1:06:44] grounds
[1:06:46] it's falling on the ears
[1:06:52] that are yielded to cause glory to his
[1:06:55] name
[1:06:58] then that will activate a faith that's
[1:07:00] inside us
[1:07:01] that will make us believe glory to his
[1:07:05] name
[1:07:06] now look at Barbie
[1:07:10] when he was sitting by the wayside
[1:07:14] and when he heard a tremendous uh uproar
[1:07:17] a lot of people
[1:07:21] and he asked what's going on
[1:07:27] when they told him what was going on who
[1:07:29] was going through there yes
[1:07:33] he would recall the stories that his
[1:07:36] mother would tell him
[1:07:37] he would tell us she would tell them
[1:07:39] about Jericho
[1:07:43] she told how Joshua overcame Jericho
[1:07:49] even though Jericho at the time was
[1:07:51] surrounded by big Wars
[1:07:55] she would tell him sores when he was
[1:07:57] little
[1:07:58] and there he was sitting down
[1:08:01] at the city of Jericho he was blind
[1:08:06] but when he heard
[1:09:05] a person that cannot see
[1:09:07] Stone they have a cane Daniel and they
[1:09:11] have a white part under it
[1:09:15] there's a there's very um several ways
[1:09:18] to distinguish a person that cannot see
[1:09:20] and we all know this
[1:09:26] he had a mantle over him Cornell with
[1:09:29] him
[1:09:31] that indicated that he was a person that
[1:09:33] was blind
[1:09:35] but when his face was inactivated
[1:09:40] when they told him and answered have
[1:09:42] faith the Master's College when he
[1:09:45] finally heard
[1:09:46] he rises from where he's at he takes off
[1:09:51] that mantle and he throws it to the
[1:09:54] ground
[1:09:55] he leaves that he deserves it he
[1:09:58] abandons it
[1:10:06] he knew that he was going to get what he
[1:10:08] was asking for oh
[1:10:10] he would no longer lead that mantle
[1:10:13] anymore because
[1:10:14] his side would be restored
[1:10:18] and we all know that that's exactly what
[1:10:21] happened
[1:10:22] his sight was restored glory to his name
[1:10:26] that blind man
[1:10:30] that brother Brandon went to pray for
[1:10:32] him
[1:10:37] and he would always saying we're always
[1:10:39] saying would always say the Lord healed
[1:10:40] me
[1:10:44] and when uh that he was at the
[1:10:46] barbershop he testified to the barber
[1:10:48] yeah
[1:10:51] I can imagine what his Barber was
[1:10:54] thinking but
[1:10:57] he just kept saying it and saying it
[1:11:02] because there was something in him that
[1:11:04] was activated
[1:11:06] he had believed glory to his name yes
[1:12:10] our children don't see us when we cry
[1:12:13] but
[1:12:14] we do cry
[1:12:16] we ask God we pray to God
[1:12:20] and when we come to church
[1:12:23] we have that petition inside us
[1:12:26] we say Lord my daughter Lord my son
[1:12:31] then that faith will be activated so
[1:12:34] praise God
[1:12:35] there will be an encounter
[1:12:39] a mighty thing will Unite with another
[1:12:42] Mighty thing
[1:12:43] so I'm preaching with the trumpet this
[1:12:45] morning
[1:12:46] brother
[1:12:50] when a man fully 100 surrenders to God
[1:12:54] 100 to God yes he's a Mighty Man
[1:13:01] the Mighty Man
[1:13:06] he needed more sunlight
[1:13:09] he needed more lights come on so then he
[1:13:12] cried out
[1:13:13] he cried out and said Son
[1:13:16] stand still
[1:13:39] and it will come to pass
[1:13:42] the scientists I'm just amazed
[1:13:46] scientists
[1:13:50] [Music]
[1:13:53] they say if he would have stopped the
[1:13:55] sun
[1:13:58] there would have been such a catastrophe
[1:14:01] that we could all still remember
[1:14:04] this morning I don't care what they say
[1:14:10] the Bible says that Joshua stopped the
[1:14:12] Sun and he stopped it
[1:14:16] there's no devils in this earth that
[1:14:18] will make me disbelieve it
[1:14:20] I believe with Allah that's exactly what
[1:14:24] happened
[1:14:25] just as I believe if you surrender to
[1:14:27] God and you just call the word you speak
[1:14:31] the word
[1:14:34] you brother and sister you speak the
[1:14:37] words
[1:14:38] the Lord will grant you what you're
[1:14:40] asking foreign
[1:15:27] I believe
[1:15:42] glory to his name
[1:15:49] if she would have asked for money then
[1:15:52] money would have appeared
[1:15:55] but just look what she asked foreign
[1:16:52] what
[1:16:56] time are we living in
[1:17:00] Saturday reading messages
[1:17:04] reading scriptures after scriptures
[1:17:09] I find that brother Branham says we're
[1:17:11] in the last days
[1:17:13] he says we're living in the last days
[1:17:16] [Music]
[1:17:18] I hope we all know that we're living in
[1:17:21] the last days
[1:17:24] women are acting like men
[1:17:27] and the first thing that I see on the
[1:17:29] news
[1:17:33] is that tremendous basketball player
[1:17:35] that's a woman
[1:17:38] and we all know the story
[1:17:42] there's many women that want to be men
[1:17:45] and there's many men that want to be
[1:17:47] women
[1:18:10] [Music]
[1:18:44] the brother spoke on Friday about the
[1:18:46] white dog and the black dog
[1:19:13] now what is it that feeds the black dog
[1:19:16] the things that are in the world
[1:19:21] the things that are in the world
[1:19:24] the Bible says don't love the world
[1:19:26] verse John 3 16. don't love the world
[1:19:31] you know the things of the world
[1:19:33] if anyone loves the world
[1:19:36] then you eat it
[1:19:38] then it's for you
[1:19:41] don't say uh whatever brother Juanito
[1:19:44] speaks
[1:19:45] oh don't don't nudge your neighbor say
[1:19:48] oh that's what that's what brother
[1:19:49] Juanito is saying
[1:19:51] this morning I'm speaking to everyone
[1:19:56] we're sounding the Jubilee trumpet
[1:19:59] every Minister that stands here
[1:20:02] when he starts to preach
[1:20:05] he's sounding the Jubilee trumpet
[1:20:09] which can make you free
[1:20:12] it can make you free
[1:20:15] what is it that you need
[1:20:18] what is the Deliverance that you need in
[1:20:21] your life
[1:20:23] maybe it's cars that are still
[1:20:25] overtaking your life
[1:20:28] maybe you're feeding the black dog too
[1:20:31] much
[1:20:32] it's gotten big and huge
[1:20:36] it easily beats the white dog
[1:20:40] because it's feeding itself
[1:20:43] but if we begin
[1:20:45] to wake up from our Slumbers
[1:20:49] know what time we're living in glory to
[1:20:53] his name
[1:20:56] you realize the hour that we're living
[1:20:58] in
[1:21:00] then you're going to want to surrender
[1:21:02] to God with all your hearts
[1:21:08] you won't care about anything else nada
[1:21:11] nothing
[1:21:15] the only thing that you care for is to
[1:21:18] do God's Will
[1:21:21] and for that we need him to help us
[1:21:28] everyone knows everybody knows
[1:21:33] this morning he wants to help out
[1:21:36] if we can just acknowledge
[1:21:40] if we struggle with something
[1:21:43] if we're feeding the black dogs
[1:21:48] then the black dog will make us lose the
[1:21:51] rewards
[1:21:53] it will make us lose eternal life
[1:22:19] that's what he wants to do with some of
[1:22:21] you this morning
[1:22:24] he wants to restore your joy of
[1:22:27] Salvation
[1:22:28] who can it be this morning
[1:22:31] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:22:34] his word is good
[1:22:36] as Mercy endures forever
[1:22:38] he can do it this morning
[1:22:41] but we have to acknowledge what is
[1:22:45] exactly what we're struggling with and
[1:22:48] don't don't be afraid
[1:22:50] run here come up here
[1:22:56] when I was younger I ran I hardly let
[1:22:58] the preacher
[1:23:01] finishes
[1:23:04] as soon as he was done I ran I had a
[1:23:08] smoking habit
[1:23:10] I had a mouse
[1:23:14] my grandmother would put soap in my
[1:23:17] mouth
[1:23:18] all right just a little he would put a
[1:23:20] she would put a little bit
[1:23:21] it was my grandmother not my mother
[1:23:25] my mother died when I was nine
[1:23:28] and my grandmother raised me
[1:23:31] so every once in a while she would open
[1:23:33] my mouth she would say open your mouth
[1:23:54] [Music]
[1:24:05] fishing in the world with our diapers
[1:24:08] we're having a good time
[1:24:11] a little boy just growing up
[1:24:14] but when my mom would say Juanito para
[1:24:17] come over here
[1:24:19] and I was I would see that she was
[1:24:21] looking for a stone
[1:24:23] you know you think I wanted to go over
[1:24:25] there no I didn't
[1:24:27] I knew what was going to happen
[1:24:31] she was looking for a little Stone to
[1:24:33] rub me with it and that really hurts
[1:24:37] brother those numbers
[1:24:38] [Music]
[1:24:42] but I had to do it but
[1:24:44] thanks to my mother glory to his name is
[1:25:00] my face and hands were Dusty
[1:25:04] she knew how to do it
[1:25:07] she knew how to do it
[1:25:11] and you think God doesn't know how to do
[1:25:13] with us
[1:25:14] he knows how to do it
[1:25:18] that's why when you see a man
[1:25:21] when he's preaching
[1:25:24] he's sounding the Jubilee trumpet
[1:25:28] he's saying you can go free
[1:25:32] I don't know but you do know
[1:25:48] [Music]
[1:25:55] there I found someone
[1:25:57] that I didn't know before
[1:26:00] there I found something
[1:26:03] that I truly needed
[1:26:06] and when he came Brothers
[1:26:09] when the preacher came and prayed for me
[1:26:12] I could feel God's presence in my life
[1:26:15] maybe for the first time
[1:26:18] just being a young man back then
[1:26:22] and I yielded and surrendered my life to
[1:26:24] God
[1:26:27] may God help and bless us all this
[1:26:29] morning the Night Comes
[1:26:33] there's a Watchman in the in the highest
[1:26:35] point
[1:26:42] just like God has a Watchman here
[1:26:47] watching over everyone that is here
[1:26:49] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:26:53] when we're we're slumbering we're
[1:26:55] sleeping
[1:26:57] The Watchman that God has placed here
[1:27:00] maybe he can't sleep
[1:27:03] maybe he has his Bible
[1:27:06] maybe maybe
[1:27:09] because just look look how many we have
[1:27:12] here
[1:27:13] as a city we are they uses
[1:27:22] that they chose a man
[1:27:25] that could distinguish
[1:27:28] between the enemies
[1:27:30] and who the person that was not an enemy
[1:27:33] here they would pick him
[1:27:48] no one can jump higher than the pasture
[1:27:51] did he say it or not
[1:28:28] yesterday reading several messages
[1:28:31] and then in Matthew 24.
[1:28:35] I find that Jesus says will be wars and
[1:28:38] rumors of wars
[1:28:41] Russia is in war with Ukraine and we
[1:28:44] know that already
[1:28:48] they're soldiers from both sides that
[1:28:50] are dying
[1:28:53] there's a war going on right now over
[1:28:55] there
[1:28:57] there's rumors of wars
[1:29:00] we just heard
[1:29:03] either yesterday or the the day before
[1:29:05] yesterday
[1:29:10] that China put uh its headquarters in
[1:29:13] Cuba
[1:29:16] on the United States
[1:29:25] brothers and sisters what we have to do
[1:29:27] is to recognize what time is it it's 11
[1:29:30] 30. it's about to be 11 30. because I
[1:29:34] can see the clock
[1:29:36] what day of the week is it look at your
[1:29:39] calendar
[1:29:40] today is June 11th Museum my wife was
[1:29:44] telling me
[1:29:46] yesterday I went to the the cemetery to
[1:29:49] go see my son and my wife says
[1:29:53] tomorrow is the five-year anniversary of
[1:29:56] our son's death
[1:29:58] tomorrow June 11.
[1:30:02] five years ago is when one of our sons
[1:30:04] passed away
[1:30:06] his name was Miguel Jose
[1:30:10] time goes by so fast it's been five
[1:30:13] years already
[1:30:14] and I can't believe it
[1:30:18] but I have to come back to my five
[1:30:20] senses
[1:30:21] that rule over me
[1:30:23] those five senses
[1:30:37] those five senses
[1:30:40] that we make contact with each other
[1:30:44] five years ago
[1:30:46] I lost one of my children
[1:30:52] today more than ever I still want to
[1:30:55] love my Lord even more
[1:30:57] he knows what he's doing and seven he
[1:31:02] knows what he's doing
[1:31:04] may he allow us to recognize that
[1:31:07] he knows exactly what he's doing the
[1:31:11] Bible says the Lord the lord taketh away
[1:31:15] but blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:31:19] because job lost everything
[1:31:26] I was able to just escape from that to
[1:31:29] give you the news
[1:31:30] four times
[1:31:32] I just escaped to give you the note to
[1:31:35] give you the news
[1:32:12] it doesn't matter whatever he would get
[1:32:15] that those boils would keep attacking
[1:32:17] him
[1:32:18] and so finally he one day was on a heap
[1:32:21] of ashes
[1:32:23] and maybe he would throw the ashes on
[1:32:25] top of him
[1:32:27] he can no longer find the way out
[1:32:31] even his wife comes and says
[1:32:35] why don't you curse
[1:32:54] but blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:33:03] I know that in my flesh I will see God
[1:33:07] one day
[1:33:09] and he did see him
[1:33:12] because when the Lord resurrected
[1:33:16] he went for all the saints that died
[1:33:18] before him
[1:33:20] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:33:23] and He took them all with him
[1:33:26] he took them all with him
[1:33:30] that's why the Bible says in one of the
[1:33:32] Psalms
[1:33:34] says
[1:33:41] and they answer back who is the king of
[1:33:43] glory
[1:34:13] how many know what time is it right now
[1:34:16] we're closer than when we believe First
[1:34:19] estamos
[1:34:21] we're closer than when we believed
[1:34:24] when I went to El Paso
[1:34:27] in the 80s
[1:34:30] and I saw my sister that's here
[1:34:33] Dominguez
[1:35:23] it's close to the 1983-84.
[1:35:29] because there's many brothers in here
[1:35:31] that many years ago they knew the truth
[1:35:37] so brothers and sisters don't forget
[1:35:39] that we're actually closer now listen it
[1:35:42] says
[1:35:49] and then knowing the time that now it is
[1:35:52] high time to wake out of our sleep for
[1:35:54] now is our Salvation nearer than when we
[1:35:57] believed
[1:35:59] the night is far spent
[1:36:02] the day is at hand
[1:36:06] let us therefore cast off the works of
[1:36:08] darkness
[1:36:10] and let us put on the armor of light
[1:36:14] let us walk as in the day
[1:36:17] honestly
[1:36:19] not in rioting and drunkenness
[1:36:22] not in chambering and wanting us
[1:36:25] not in Strife
[1:36:29] but ye on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:36:34] and make not provision for the flesh
[1:36:37] this flesh is
[1:36:41] [Music]
[1:36:43] whenever we fulfill the desire of what
[1:36:46] this flesh wants
[1:36:48] remember which is the one that you're
[1:36:51] feeding of the two
[1:36:53] and one of them is going to beat the
[1:36:55] other brand
[1:36:59] this uh brother random he asked his
[1:37:01] chief
[1:37:03] and he says Chief which one do you think
[1:37:05] is the one that wins
[1:37:07] [Music]
[1:37:09] he says it depends on who I feed the
[1:37:11] most that's a good answer right
[1:37:15] it depends on who I feed the most
[1:37:19] so take that with you
[1:37:22] it all depends who we're feeding the
[1:37:25] most that's the one the walls
[1:37:28] as children of the lights
[1:37:30] we're waking up now
[1:37:34] if you put your alarm at a certain time
[1:37:37] don't turn it off
[1:37:41] don't snooze it make sure
[1:38:20] and then we can be free
[1:38:22] if you lost your house in the past
[1:38:26] you could get it back then immediately
[1:38:30] if you were a slave you were working at
[1:38:32] a Ranch
[1:38:34] at the moment you would hear the Jubilee
[1:38:37] trumpets
[1:38:39] you wouldn't throw down your shovel and
[1:38:41] your hose
[1:38:53] and you would go and claim your freedom
[1:38:57] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:39:02] and that trumpet would be sounding
[1:39:05] lasting for an entire year so blessed be
[1:39:08] the name of the Lord
[1:39:10] so we should be happy this morning
[1:39:14] that three times a week
[1:39:17] that Jubilee trumpet is sounded to us
[1:39:22] so if there's a people without an excuse
[1:39:26] we're one of those people
[1:39:29] we are without an excuse
[1:39:44] [Music]
[1:39:47] we're going to read another scripture in
[1:39:49] first Thessalonians
[1:39:52] I'm skipping over a lot of the things
[1:39:56] I'm skipping over a lot of things I
[1:39:58] wanted to say but a glory to his name
[1:40:00] because he's the one that has the
[1:40:02] controls
[1:40:04] we just surrendered to him
[1:40:07] first Thessalonians 5.
[1:40:10] if you find it say Amen
[1:40:15] I'll be in verse
[1:40:22] says but of the times and the seasons
[1:40:25] Brethren ye have no need that I write
[1:40:26] unto you
[1:40:33] it says for you know yourselves
[1:40:36] perfectly that the day of the Lord so
[1:40:38] cometh as a thief in the night glory to
[1:40:41] his name
[1:40:46] and say hey I'm coming steal for me
[1:40:49] please don't come out
[1:40:55] our car isn't there anymore
[1:40:58] when we go out
[1:41:00] yeah
[1:41:01] our truck isn't there anymore
[1:41:04] they stole it from us
[1:41:07] who stole it from us
[1:41:11] and he didn't notify us at what time he
[1:41:13] was coming at what time did he come
[1:41:17] he just came and took our truck
[1:41:20] we didn't even notice
[1:41:23] we were dreaming with the angels and the
[1:41:26] Stars
[1:41:28] hopefully with the angels
[1:41:31] the other day I had a dream that I was
[1:41:34] crashing my truck see so yes that I I
[1:41:36] dreamed that but then I woke up
[1:41:49] it was just a dream
[1:41:53] it was just a dream
[1:41:56] but it seems that it's real
[1:41:58] hasn't that happened to you it seems
[1:42:02] real
[1:42:50] just pay attention to him
[1:42:53] don't get scared
[1:42:56] just pay attention to him
[1:42:58] and keep still
[1:43:02] about a year ago
[1:43:27] don't wake up and call me immediately at
[1:43:29] 1am
[1:43:31] because then I will die
[1:44:20] for yourselves know perfectly that the
[1:44:23] day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in
[1:44:25] the night
[1:44:32] for when they shall say peace and safety
[1:44:35] then sudden destruction cometh upon them
[1:44:37] as travail upon a woman with child and
[1:44:39] they shall not Escape
[1:44:41] Now record this
[1:44:44] memorize this but ye Brethren
[1:44:49] you brothers were preaching to you yes
[1:44:52] it says
[1:44:57] are not in darkness
[1:45:01] that that day should overtake you as it
[1:45:04] is
[1:45:05] because
[1:45:09] the children of lie and the children of
[1:45:12] the day
[1:45:13] we are not of the nights
[1:45:17] nor of Darkness
[1:45:19] therefore
[1:45:21] let us not sleep as do others let us
[1:45:26] watch is
[1:45:29] Glory to his name amen Brothers
[1:45:33] says therefore Brethren this is in verse
[1:45:40] therefore let us not sleep as do others
[1:45:43] well let us watch and be sober
[1:45:46] the Night Comes
[1:45:50] but when that night comes and goes then
[1:45:54] the day comes the day comes
[1:45:57] let's be Children of the day
[1:46:01] let's be Children of the day not of the
[1:46:05] night
[1:46:10] I tell my family and to many of you I
[1:46:12] give this Council
[1:46:14] if you don't work during the night
[1:46:18] because there are brothers that work
[1:46:20] during the night
[1:46:21] they're sisters that work during the
[1:46:23] night
[1:46:25] if you don't have a night shift
[1:46:29] we have no business being outside
[1:46:35] hopefully I'm speaking to people with
[1:46:37] revelation
[1:46:39] we have no business being outside
[1:46:44] because the majority there are outside
[1:46:47] and are of darkness
[1:46:49] and they love Darkness
[1:46:53] they're waiting for the night to come
[1:46:58] they're waiting for the the night time
[1:47:00] to come
[1:47:01] but we are not of the night
[1:47:04] we are the day
[1:47:09] we're part of that glow that the Lord
[1:47:11] has sent to us so glory to his name
[1:47:16] Zechariah 14 6 and we'll be closing
[1:47:20] time went by so quickly
[1:47:23] but the Lord knows everything
[1:47:25] amen Brothers
[1:47:28] may God give us the life in the house
[1:47:31] we'll pick this up on another occasion
[1:47:37] Zechariah 14. have you found it
[1:47:41] and I would appreciate if the musicians
[1:47:44] can come forward now as well
[1:47:54] there you can receive your healing
[1:47:58] many have already received it
[1:48:01] the elders have now prayed for you
[1:48:04] now my question is do you believe amen
[1:48:08] amen
[1:48:10] I believe it and to his name be the
[1:48:12] glory amen Hermanos amen Brothers
[1:48:26] because we feel embarrassed
[1:48:29] many times we don't come up
[1:48:35] because we think that somebody else will
[1:48:38] criticize us
[1:48:40] but do you know this
[1:48:42] when I ran to that place
[1:48:47] I ran up there and I didn't care that
[1:48:50] everyone else was criticizing
[1:48:52] I knew the need that I had
[1:48:55] yeah
[1:48:55] and have a good I have good news for you
[1:48:58] Leos
[1:49:00] God God gave me what I needed and those
[1:49:04] is
[1:49:06] so many times we
[1:49:08] say I don't know
[1:49:11] I would like to know but I don't know
[1:49:14] we just remain in the pews
[1:49:17] but if you stay in the Pew stay there
[1:49:20] stay there
[1:49:22] just sit there but
[1:49:25] what you have to do is open your heart
[1:49:27] to God
[1:50:16] God bless the musicians this morning
[1:50:20] the scripture says here is
[1:50:26] shall come to pass in that day say that
[1:50:28] the light shall not be clear nor dark
[1:50:35] those that know the message know what
[1:50:38] the prophet says about the scripture
[1:50:41] many people were not going to know what
[1:50:45] to do
[1:50:47] denominations
[1:50:48] or the truth
[1:50:51] there's only one truth solamente there's
[1:50:55] only one message
[1:50:58] our brothers have been saying it and
[1:51:00] preaching it
[1:51:02] there's only one Bible
[1:51:04] [Music]
[1:51:07] that's the one that I use this morning
[1:51:10] there's only one Bible
[1:51:14] and there's only one message
[1:51:19] so blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:51:25] [Music]
[1:51:27] is explaining what the Bible says to us
[1:51:30] amen amen to him or lose we've had
[1:51:34] lights
[1:51:35] at the evening time
[1:51:41] and it says in verse 6 and it shall come
[1:51:43] to pass on that day that the light shall
[1:51:45] not be clear nor dark
[1:51:47] but it shall be one day which shall be
[1:51:50] known to the Lord
[1:51:56] but it shall come to pass that in the
[1:51:59] evening time it shall be light
[1:52:03] there shall be lights
[1:52:06] that's something that I believe all this
[1:52:08] uh this morning with all my heart if I
[1:52:11] ask how many believe this morning
[1:52:13] now there shall be lights
[1:52:17] many people don't know in in water I
[1:52:21] don't know
[1:52:32] that he's Mighty foreign
