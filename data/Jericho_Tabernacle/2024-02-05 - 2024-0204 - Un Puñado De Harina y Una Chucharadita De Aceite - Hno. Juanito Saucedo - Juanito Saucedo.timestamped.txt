[58:25] that God
[58:28] does he didn't send his Prophet to a
[58:30] rich
[58:34] man he didn't send his Prophet to
[58:37] someone who has the
[58:40] means but he sent him to a widow
[58:44] woman it's like if I were to come from
[58:46] the city of
[58:51] Mexico he said get to sister's house
[58:59] amen come to the household of the
[59:03] sister we see that they're honest Widow
[59:07] women that they maintain themselves in
[59:10] the
[59:11] church they have a good
[59:15] testimony but why to a widow
[59:21] woman why doesn't he send him with
[59:23] someone who has a lot
[59:26] God knows what he's
[59:28] doing we give him the honor and the
[59:30] glory this
[59:32] morning

[59:43] zerath and when he came to the City Gate
[59:46] of the city behold the little one was
[59:47] there Gathering of
[59:53] sticks and he called to her and said
[59:55] fetch me I pray thee a little water and
[59:57] a vessel that I may
[59:59] drink another odd
[1:00:02] thing it hasn't rained for three years

[1:00:05] half the the water was
[1:00:09] scarce the people in the streets were
[1:00:11] were
[1:00:13] complaining the wells have been dried
[1:00:16] up the rivers have been dried
[1:00:20] up there was no
[1:00:23] water

[1:00:30] asking and it it says I pray the give me
[1:00:33] a little water in a vessel that I may
[1:00:34] [Music]
[1:00:36] drink and as she was going to f

[1:00:44] said bring bring me I pray thee a morsel
[1:00:47] of bread in thy
[1:00:49] hand she didn't have anything
[1:00:53] else

[1:00:57] handful handful of of
[1:01:00] meal that's all that she
[1:01:03] had a handful of
[1:01:08] meal and a little bit of
[1:01:13] oil and she picked up these
[1:01:19] sticks I'm going to read that she only
[1:01:21] picked up two

[1:01:29] sticks see if I can
[1:01:32] grab what can you do with two little
[1:01:36] sticks you can form a
[1:01:41] cross and that is what she was trusting
[1:01:45] in not a whole lot of
[1:01:50] firewood she didn't have enough strength
[1:01:52] to pick up this firewood
[1:01:56] but she want to pick up two
[1:02:00] sticks to prepare the handful of meal
[1:02:02] that she
[1:02:04] had and a little bit of oil that's left
[1:02:09] over me and my son or I going to go in a

[1:03:50] they stored a lot of their
[1:03:53] cans that's in the natural
[1:03:57] Lord but there might be some of
[1:04:04] us that we might not have enough in our

[1:04:35] spiritual we've only have a handful of
[1:04:39] meal and a spoonful of

[1:04:57] amen let me take your
[1:05:04] seats there's three messages that I want
[1:05:06] to recommend to
[1:05:08] you for not to mention
[1:05:16] four when we mention a message here when
[1:05:18] we're standing here
[1:05:21] brother I always carry with me a a
[1:05:26] notebook I always mention the name of
[1:05:29] the of the
[1:05:32] minister I I write down the title that
[1:05:35] he's I write down the
[1:05:40] scriptures and I put their
[1:05:44] scriptures because he's going to read
[1:05:46] more than once
[1:05:50] perhaps and halfway through my journal I
[1:05:52] put messages
[1:05:56] he's going to mention some
[1:06:03] messages and when the minister mentions
[1:06:05] the messages that he's going to
[1:06:09] read he's going to read them he has them
[1:06:16] there he already has them God gave it to
[1:06:19] him and God told him going to read
[1:06:23] this
[1:06:24] so we get up here we give you the
[1:06:29] messages because we can't get up here
[1:06:31] and read everything completely we don't
[1:06:33] have the
[1:06:35] time to read the whole full
[1:06:40] message but we give you the most
[1:06:42] outstanding
[1:06:46] portions hoping that God might give you
[1:06:48] that
[1:06:50] Revelation so whenever you get
[1:06:53] home when you go back to your house you
[1:06:56] may look for
[1:06:57] it you may look for it and search
[1:07:01] it I heard a young man from New Mexico
[1:07:05] his name is
[1:07:09] Tim and he preached the message as
[1:07:12] something like
[1:07:16] this and he preached a message uh the
[1:07:19] message brother Rand be certain of God I
[1:07:22] uh wrote it down
[1:07:24] I went back to my house I studied
[1:07:28] it and for a
[1:07:31] month I have not stopped reading it for
[1:07:34] studying it for one
[1:07:37] month I haven't uh I haven't I've been
[1:07:40] having been reading all
[1:07:43] day and every time I read I learn
[1:07:45] something from
[1:07:47] it so this morning my
[1:07:50] message and the message that I want to
[1:07:53] that I want to bring to
[1:07:56] you I brought it from that
[1:07:59] message be certain of
[1:08:03] God I put a handful of
[1:08:06] meal a handful of
[1:08:10] meal and a spoonful of
[1:08:14] oil and a spoonful of
[1:08:19] oil that Widow has came to the last
[1:08:26] just like
[1:08:28] us we we reach the
[1:08:30] bottom and we seem that there's no
[1:08:35] exit we seem seems like there's no
[1:08:37] intercession
[1:08:39] now I I tell you this
[1:08:43] morning and there's someone like this
[1:08:45] this morning that are they find
[1:08:47] themselves like
[1:08:48] this remember there is a
[1:08:52] God remember there is a
[1:08:56] [Music]
[1:08:57] God you see that he doesn't move or
[1:08:59] doesn't do
[1:09:02] anything is because he's
[1:09:09] working so the first message I want to
[1:09:11] recommend to you is be certain of
[1:09:16] God the second one is Elijah and the
[1:09:18] meal
[1:09:20] offering that message I I liked it I I
[1:09:22] enjoy it very much
[1:09:25] Phoenix Arona and he also preach it here
[1:09:26] in Phoenix
[1:09:30] Arizona the third message is spiritual
[1:09:32] food in its due
[1:09:35] season and when you read those three
[1:09:38] messages and when you've gone over
[1:09:41] them and you go over them
[1:09:45] again I recommend the fourth
[1:09:48] message straight is the
[1:09:51] gate and narrow is the way
[1:09:55] I have a month and a
[1:09:57] half listening to those same four
[1:10:00] messages and even though I I listen to
[1:10:04] more but I go back to these four
[1:10:12] messages you don't know how much you
[1:10:14] learn when you listen to to God's voice
[1:10:16] in these
[1:10:18] days and I believe it's it's a
[1:10:22] Time
[1:10:25] scripture says that God will send a
[1:10:26] famine upon the
[1:10:29] earth now we don't have hunger anymore
[1:10:32] thanks be to
[1:10:34] God in the natural we're no longer
[1:10:38] hungry there's days that we eat three
[1:10:40] meals a
[1:10:42] day and some might not have
[1:10:45] that because even though we might be in
[1:10:47] the United
[1:10:49] States but there's also hunger here in
[1:10:51] the
[1:10:52] states
[1:10:54] there are fridges that are completely
[1:10:57] filled and there's no more room to put
[1:10:59] food in
[1:11:00] there and the pantries are
[1:11:03] filled but I tell
[1:11:07] you but there's people that don't have
[1:11:10] to
[1:11:11] eat thanks be to
[1:11:13] God that we have something to
[1:11:16] eat in the
[1:11:19] natural but in the
[1:11:22] spiritual God said I I will send a
[1:11:24] famine upon the Earth it won't be for
[1:11:28] water it won't be for
[1:11:30] bread like I said and I repeat it
[1:11:34] again we have that in
[1:11:38] abundance but it should be a
[1:11:41] hunger to hear God's
[1:11:45] word it should be a hunger to hear God's
[1:11:52] word
[1:11:54] so remember God's word is more important
[1:11:56] than anything
[1:11:57] else blessed be the name of the Lord am
[1:12:03] amen so when we give a
[1:12:08] message and we give another message and
[1:12:12] you write it
[1:12:13] down and you go back home and you look
[1:12:15] for them and
[1:12:17] you and you rehear them
[1:12:22] again God gives something
[1:12:25] special blessed be the name of the
[1:12:28] Lord and we're very happy with
[1:12:31] God on Friday when we were here at
[1:12:35] church and we heard a brother
[1:12:40] Castillo sure's here while back
[1:12:44] home is brother Castillo
[1:12:52] here
[1:12:54] may God bless our brother Nick
[1:12:57] Castillo I really enjoyed his his
[1:13:00] sermon because in this
[1:13:04] message that I'm quoting of being
[1:13:06] certain of
[1:13:07] God and I had written down
[1:13:11] here to mention Jo for about 15
[1:13:16] minutes because of how time goes really
[1:13:19] quickly but if you came here on
[1:13:22] Friday
[1:13:23] all you saw
[1:13:27] online certainly I woke up Ear early in
[1:13:29] the morning and I reheard his
[1:13:32] message all the message from
[1:13:35] Friday I reheard it again this
[1:13:39] morning and I Rejoice hearing of brother
[1:13:43] Castillo because indicates one
[1:13:47] thing that we're connected in the same
[1:13:50] channel because I come Friday and he
[1:13:56] preaches seasons of
[1:13:59] tension and he speaks of
[1:14:04] job and job had four admirable
[1:14:09] things and four job had four beautiful
[1:14:19] things but even so God still tried the
[1:14:22] faith of
[1:14:26] and and God tries all of
[1:14:31] us and God has all the right to try all
[1:14:34] of
[1:14:36] us J was a sincere
[1:14:40] man he was a man who was faithful to
[1:14:44] God we know that he was he was
[1:14:49] rich we know that his riches from
[1:14:51] morning to night I gone
[1:14:55] away I was talking to my wife and I was
[1:14:57] telling
[1:14:59] her how his
[1:15:01] wife how she also
[1:15:05] suffered now the Bible doesn't really
[1:15:07] show The Suffering of his
[1:15:10] wife it talks about job's
[1:15:16] suffering but we see that it was the
[1:15:18] children of both of
[1:15:21] them what they had was for both of
[1:15:25] them and everything was taken
[1:15:28] away they were left without
[1:15:31] nothing and her her husband
[1:15:37] job she he had something in his body
[1:15:39] that it was it was he couldn't handle it
[1:15:43] anymore there comes to a time when she
[1:15:45] comes to
[1:15:48] him he says why don't you curse God and
[1:15:50] just
[1:15:52] die
[1:15:54] in this message be certain of God
[1:15:55] brother Ram
[1:15:59] says she wasn't a foolish
[1:16:03] woman but she spoke as a foolish
[1:16:08] woman why don't you just curse God and
[1:16:10] just
[1:16:14] die and sometimes brother when we men go
[1:16:17] through infirmities or
[1:16:22] sicknesses this month and a half I've
[1:16:23] been going for some going through
[1:16:25] something very
[1:16:29] terrible i' never gone through a month
[1:16:31] and a half so terrible like I did this
[1:16:33] past month and a
[1:16:34] half and also
[1:16:38] myself have a lot of faith and trust
[1:16:40] towards
[1:16:43] God and always beg and ask the
[1:16:47] Lord I will I will make an
[1:16:52] inventory
[1:16:53] I ask God and say
[1:16:57] God I came from a certain place and I
[1:16:59] preached over
[1:17:01] there I drove five to six
[1:17:05] hours I'm thankful that you took me and
[1:17:07] you brought me
[1:17:10] back I prayed I begged and I've
[1:17:13] asked I go to
[1:17:15] church that's my
[1:17:19] life the church is my life that's all I
[1:17:22] have
[1:17:23] but but Lord if there's
[1:17:27] something that I need to confess to you
[1:17:29] tell me
[1:17:31] Lord when we bring everything to
[1:17:35] God and we're still uh going through
[1:17:40] something and we see that there's no
[1:17:42] light at the end of the
[1:17:45] tunnel remember God is still
[1:17:50] working God is trying your faith
[1:17:54] if he doesn't heal you
[1:17:55] today don't
[1:17:59] worry but make sure that all is well
[1:18:02] with
[1:18:04] God job knew that all was well with
[1:18:08] God when they accused him be to be a
[1:18:10] secret
[1:18:11] sinner he said I am not a
[1:18:14] sinner I've have offered
[1:18:17] sacrifices for my
[1:18:20] children in case if they were to sin
[1:18:23] he was an honest man he was a prudent
[1:18:26] man A Man Who Loved God but nothing the
[1:18:33] less it seemed like God did not listen
[1:18:35] to him
[1:18:38] remember when he seems like God is not
[1:18:40] listening to
[1:18:43] you and it seems like we're worse from
[1:18:47] yesterday it seem like there's no way
[1:18:51] out when it seems
[1:18:58] I'm going to tell you that God is still
[1:19:00] working with you this
[1:19:02] morning blessed be the name of the
[1:19:05] Lord job came to the
[1:19:08] recognition that he came without
[1:19:11] nothing and I'm going to leave with
[1:19:15] nothing and that's something that we
[1:19:17] must record in our
[1:19:19] mind we brought nothing into this world
[1:19:23] the Apostle St Paul
[1:19:24] said and we're not going to take
[1:19:29] anything we're not going to take out
[1:19:33] anything so everything we owe it to
[1:19:38] him he should be number one in our
[1:19:42] lives he should be number one in our
[1:19:47] lives when we put other things like
[1:19:49] number
[1:19:51] one
[1:19:55] we're worshiping an
[1:19:56] idol and
[1:19:59] remember here in the United
[1:20:03] States the people are worried a lot
[1:20:05] about their
[1:20:07] houses they were worry a lot about their
[1:20:11] jobs they worry a lot about their
[1:20:15] money and they worry a lot about their
[1:20:19] cars these natural things that we see
[1:20:26] nothing that we have are we going to
[1:20:27] take
[1:20:29] it give thanks to God for what you
[1:20:33] have and if you need something God will
[1:20:36] give it to
[1:20:37] you God will give it to
[1:20:40] you not when you want
[1:20:42] it but when God wants to give it to
[1:20:45] you blessed be the name of the
[1:20:50] Lord but when the brothers we go through
[1:20:52] a a tremendous time like
[1:20:54] that a cough in the
[1:20:57] night I'm talking about just a
[1:21:02] cough and my wife would turn to me and
[1:21:04] said just drink a little bit of
[1:21:06] water get a get a little cough drop in
[1:21:09] your for your
[1:21:11] throat a water and a cuff

[1:21:26] something

[1:21:31] you even though you're waking up every
[1:21:33] 15 minutes but there she is or

[1:21:42] God place all your confidence in
[1:21:46] God and God will help us God going to
[1:21:49] bless
[1:21:51] us blessed be the the name of the
[1:21:54] Lord we can spend a lot of time speaking
[1:21:56] about
[1:22:01] job but there's another thing that
[1:22:02] brother Brandon mentioned in that same
[1:22:05] message I'd like to for you to open up
[1:22:07] your Bibles to the Book of
[1:22:11] Daniel and I believe it's the third
[1:22:21] chapter
[1:22:24] I want to spend about about 10 minutes
[1:22:29] there this is in the story where King
[1:22:32] Nebuchadnezzar makes an
[1:22:35] image we see that he sent forth a
[1:22:39] decree an
[1:22:42] order that everyone should worship
[1:22:45] him but in his
[1:22:48] kingdom there were three young
[1:22:51] men subra M and
[1:22:56] abnal here the men have preached a lot
[1:22:58] about
[1:23:00] that I'm just repeating of what they
[1:23:02] once
[1:23:05] said so Nebuchadnezzar raised up a great
[1:23:08] big
[1:23:11] image and the people all the people
[1:23:14] worship the people bowed down to
[1:23:17] it but there were three young
[1:23:20] men that refused to to bow down to
[1:23:25] it let's go to Daniel
[1:23:30] 3 let's go to the 15th
[1:23:36] verse we're gonna read the last portion
[1:23:39] or last
[1:23:48] sentence said if you're willing are
[1:23:50] you're ready for the sound of the Cornet
[1:23:52] the
[1:23:59] music and the last sentence of 15 and
[1:24:02] who is the god that shall deliver you
[1:24:03] out of my
[1:24:07] hands and who is that God that shall
[1:24:09] deliver you out of my
[1:24:12] hands that is what that King told that
[1:24:14] those three young
[1:24:18] men and who is that God that should
[1:24:20] deliver you out of my hands

[1:24:25] is a
[1:24:26] God the mighty
[1:24:31] conqueror he is the one to deliver us
[1:24:33] all the
[1:24:35] time he's always watching us all the
[1:24:38] time he knows your

[1:24:46] are he knows when you're
[1:24:49] sick he knows everything about you
[1:24:54] and remember he loves us but he if he
[1:24:57] loves
[1:24:59] us if he has so much trust towards
[1:25:02] us he will
[1:25:06] allow he has to
[1:25:09] allow but on the contrary nothing will
[1:25:12] happen he has to allow
[1:25:15] it for a small infirmity to
[1:25:19] come go without a week without work
[1:25:23] [Music]
[1:25:25] that your car in the morning doesn't
[1:25:26] want to turn
[1:25:29] on go through a
[1:25:32] trial that you know that you should not
[1:25:34] be going through that trial but you're
[1:25:37] going through it it came to
[1:25:39] you let me tell you this
[1:25:43] morning it's God trying your
[1:25:47] faith let that faith not get
[1:25:51] dismayed for his name be the
[1:25:55] glory and what is that God that should
[1:25:57] deliver you out of my hands this he says
[1:26:08] verse S drach massak and answered
[1:26:11] and said to the king oh Nebuchadnezzar
[1:26:12] we are not careful to answer thee in
[1:26:15] this
[1:26:17] matter it is not necessary for us to
[1:26:20] answer you in this matter
[1:26:24] look Our God who we
[1:26:27] serve is able to Deliver Us from the
[1:26:31] burning and he will deliver us out of
[1:26:33] thy hand O
[1:26:35] King notice what they're saying what
[1:26:37] kind of
[1:26:41] faith and he will deliver us out of
[1:26:44] thine
[1:26:45] hand he said he might Deliver Us said no
[1:26:50] he said he will Deliver Us
[1:26:53] PR his name be the
[1:26:55] glory they had
[1:26:58] Faith they knew who they were trusting
[1:27:01] in now my answer question
[1:27:04] is do we also have
[1:27:07] faith do we know who we we're believing
[1:27:11] in I know who I'm believing
[1:27:14] in I know where my my faith is
[1:27:19] resting even though I went through a
[1:27:20] month and a half that was terrible
[1:27:24] but I know who I'm trusting
[1:27:26] in and coughing and being
[1:27:29] sick I say the Lord
[1:27:31] Lord you know what you're
[1:27:35] doing but Lord just give me
[1:27:39] patience let not my faith be dismayed on
[1:27:45] you you know when he's going to give you
[1:27:47] the way out for his name be the
[1:27:50] glory when there's an
[1:27:52] entrance there's also an
[1:27:56] exit and he knows when to give us that
[1:27:59] exit those three young
[1:28:03] men those three young men said it's not
[1:28:05] necessary for us to answer you about
[1:28:07] this
[1:28:08] man the god that we
[1:28:11] serve he will deliver us out of that
[1:28:14] far but he if he does not do
[1:28:18] so we will still not Bow Down and
[1:28:21] Worship
[1:28:23] and the message brother R says be
[1:28:24] certain of
[1:28:25] God he says because they
[1:28:29] knew that if God were was not to deliver
[1:28:32] him out of the fiery
[1:28:34] furnace and they had to walk to the
[1:28:37] fiery furnace and
[1:28:40] die God was going to raise them up in
[1:28:42] the first
[1:28:45] resurrection God was going to raise them
[1:28:47] up in the first
[1:28:48] resurrection they had that
[1:28:51] trust
[1:28:52] so we're not going to bow down to it
[1:28:55] we're not going to worship
[1:28:57] it blessed be the name of the
[1:29:00] Lord what
[1:29:04] trust another messages the prophet
[1:29:08] says he was observing the
[1:29:11] scene and the angel comes and
[1:29:15] says Lord allow me I'll
[1:29:18] go and I'll go and I'll change the scene
[1:29:23] and I believe he was able to do
[1:29:26] [Music]
[1:29:30] that I believe that angel going have
[1:29:32] come and eras Babylon with everything
[1:29:33] that it
[1:29:36] had to bring down a flood and get rid of
[1:29:41] everything but that a loving being
[1:29:43] that's up
[1:29:44] there and is observing
[1:29:47] you and it's only proving your
[1:29:50] faith when you stand up for
[1:29:53] him remember he will stand up for
[1:29:57] you that's the SC says who shall confess
[1:30:01] me in public from in front of the
[1:30:06] men I will raise them up oh speak of him
[1:30:09] to my
[1:30:10] father blessed be the name of the
[1:30:13] Lord but he was observing
[1:30:16] them he says
[1:30:18] no said they trust in me
[1:30:22] says this is my
[1:30:24] job and he brought forth a
[1:30:27] chariot and he came down
[1:30:30] himself blessed be the name of the
[1:30:32] Lord he came down
[1:30:37] himself Went to went to come and comfort
[1:30:40] those three young
[1:30:43] men not one hair of them was
[1:30:48] burnt because when God does it he does
[1:30:50] it right
[1:30:53] he he shows everybody that he is the
[1:30:56] God blessed be the name of the
[1:30:59] Lord going back to our
[1:31:04] message Ahab was the
[1:31:11] king he he was one of the most wickedest
[1:31:14] kings that Israel ever
[1:31:17] had his father was like
[1:31:20] him
[1:31:24] and truly Ahab went and got
[1:31:28] married with a woman named
[1:31:32] Jezebel brother said there was no doubt
[1:31:35] that Jezebel was a beautiful
[1:31:40] woman but Ahab had no reason to go get
[1:31:43] married with
[1:31:49] her a Christian should marry another
[1:31:54] Christian and I say Amen to
[1:31:57] that
[1:32:00] amen I believe that a Christian should
[1:32:03] marry another
[1:32:04] Christian but there are no
[1:32:07] youth how is there no youth who said
[1:32:09] that there's no
[1:32:13] youth if I say a youth to stand up all
[1:32:15] of them will stand
[1:32:19] up if I tell the young sisters that
[1:32:21] stand up they will stand
[1:32:23] up what we need to
[1:32:26] do is for God to open up your
[1:32:31] eyes that's what happened to the servant
[1:32:34] of
[1:32:36] Elijah he says elishah says Lord we're
[1:32:40] surrounded he saw with his own
[1:32:43] eyes he saw with his own
[1:32:46] eyes and they saw that they were
[1:32:50] surrounded and the master the prophet
[1:32:53] said says
[1:32:56] Lord open up the eyes of my servant so
[1:32:58] you can
[1:32:59] see and so when God opened up the eyes
[1:33:01] of his servant he
[1:33:06] saw that the mountains were filled with
[1:33:10] angels for his name be the glory
[1:33:15] amen so just take that
[1:33:18] advice and God will help you and bless
[1:33:20] you
[1:33:23] must have been a terrible
[1:33:25] morning it's hot and dry Phoenix we live
[1:33:28] in
[1:33:31] Phoenix when we have temperatures of
[1:33:36] 118 I'm not sure we've gotten to 120
[1:33:38] this summer we
[1:33:40] have and outside it's
[1:33:44] miserable you can't be outside for much
[1:33:48] time so we know already have an idea of
[1:33:51] what the heat
[1:33:53] is must have been a terrible
[1:33:56] morning dry and
[1:34:02] hot
[1:34:07] amen there hadn't had no rain for three
[1:34:09] years and a half and six
[1:34:15] months it was so dry and hot to the
[1:34:17] world was ready to blaze into
[1:34:20] fire
[1:34:22] the people were starving in the
[1:34:25] streets and there was cry
[1:34:29] everywhere and all this had been
[1:34:33] through all this had been brought
[1:34:35] because of the moral decay of the
[1:34:38] nation Israel was loved of
[1:34:42] God but when they got out of the will of
[1:34:45] God the enemy had had taken him
[1:34:50] over when one gets out of the will of
[1:34:53] God notice what I'm
[1:34:56] saying when someone gets out of the will
[1:34:59] of
[1:35:01] God who is the one that will take
[1:35:03] control the
[1:35:06] enemy there's only
[1:35:08] two it's only God and
[1:35:12] Satan so when we get out of the will of
[1:35:16] God when we leave
[1:35:18] God when we forget about everything
[1:35:23] so who's going to start controlling
[1:35:26] us may God help us this
[1:35:29] morning blessed be the name of the
[1:35:34] lord it's something like
[1:35:40] today they're all in agreement that they
[1:35:42] did
[1:35:46] that because the government and the
[1:35:48] queen endorsed
[1:35:50] it
[1:35:53] because the most the the government and
[1:35:54] the king and the queen endorsed
[1:35:58] it and they were the most popular people
[1:36:00] in that
[1:36:02] Nation let me bring something a little
[1:36:04] bit more
[1:36:07] close brother R says we had a Catholic
[1:36:11] President and without doubt we're going
[1:36:13] to have another
[1:36:17] one I'm not going to say but you know
[1:36:19] who I'm talking about
[1:36:22] Kenedy we have a president by the name
[1:36:23] of John F
[1:36:27] Kennedy he was a president declared a
[1:36:30] full
[1:36:32] [Music]
[1:36:35] Catholic and the his wife was named is
[1:36:40] Jacqueline and let me tell you what they
[1:36:44] did they took out the prayers out of the
[1:36:47] church out of out of the
[1:36:50] schools
[1:36:53] so when when the teachers gathered
[1:36:54] together ready ready to start
[1:36:56] learning they would take out a
[1:36:59] Bible and read something out of
[1:37:01] it and then a prayer was
[1:37:04] made they commended themselves to
[1:37:08] God all of that was taken out of the
[1:37:12] schools by a man and a
[1:37:16] woman say we had a Catholic
[1:37:20] President and without doubt we're going
[1:37:22] to have another
[1:37:23] one let me bring it in today's
[1:37:27] day the president that we have today in
[1:37:29] the White
[1:37:31] House and don't hit me when we
[1:37:35] leave but he is a a full Catholic
[1:37:40] President what brother ramam said is the
[1:37:43] truth that's why I believe
[1:37:46] it and that's why I shout it
[1:37:49] out when someone gets out of the will of
[1:37:54] God there's someone else that comes and
[1:37:56] take takes control of your
[1:37:59] life if you have to come back to God
[1:38:01] this morning
[1:38:03] Run come
[1:38:06] back it's like a place was to be
[1:38:10] burning and you're there inside the
[1:38:13] building get out of
[1:38:16] there take your kids with
[1:38:19] you cuz that fire take away your
[1:38:22] life and I tell all of you this
[1:38:26] morning if we have to run to God this
[1:38:28] morning run to
[1:38:33] God you might be running to the bottom
[1:38:35] of the barrel this
[1:38:38] morning there might be just a handful of
[1:38:41] meal just for one one little bit of meal
[1:38:45] left and a little bit of oil to cook
[1:38:48] it but remember brothers and sisters
[1:38:52] there's two
[1:38:55] sticks there's two sticks that that wiow
[1:38:57] want to go pick
[1:38:59] up and brother R said that is the
[1:39:02] cross and remember who was the one who
[1:39:04] died upon that
[1:39:07] cross there was only two sticks that
[1:39:09] they were
[1:39:10] required and that is what she picked up
[1:39:13] but let me tell you
[1:39:16] this a little bit over half an hour let
[1:39:19] me tell you this
[1:39:24] before God plans what he's going to
[1:39:28] do God prepares all
[1:39:34] things and I'm going to repeat what
[1:39:35] brother Castillo said on
[1:39:40] Friday and me I was screaming and
[1:39:42] shouting where I was at he forgot his
[1:39:47] Bible he almost left the whole the
[1:39:49] complete town
[1:39:53] [Applause]
[1:39:55] when he usually leaves to a certain
[1:39:59] training usually he doesn't carry a suit
[1:40:01] and a
[1:40:03] tie because he knows he's coming forth
[1:40:05] our
[1:40:10] training it's like us when we leave the
[1:40:14] church they brothers that go out and
[1:40:16] they go
[1:40:18] change and I always just go like that
[1:40:22] there I am eating and and the tie is
[1:40:24] there on the
[1:40:25] Chile he says watch your
[1:40:28] tie I just go like
[1:40:32] that but there's brothers that have take
[1:40:34] the time to go home and they
[1:40:37] change that's
[1:40:39] fine may God help
[1:40:47] us but let us not take off our eyes on
[1:40:49] what we truly believe
[1:40:51] PR his name be the
[1:40:54] glory but he said but I went back home
[1:40:56] to get my
[1:41:02] Bible and that was all before brother
[1:41:05] Eli asked me if I could preach on
[1:41:07] Friday that's why I tell you this
[1:41:10] morning before God can do
[1:41:14] something God prepares the
[1:41:19] things but Cas he perhaps didn't
[1:41:24] know the brother was going to ask him to
[1:41:26] preach on
[1:41:28] Friday but he packed the suit and
[1:41:32] TI he went back for his
[1:41:37] Bible and on Friday he came here and
[1:41:38] preached a beautiful
[1:41:40] message may God bless our
[1:41:42] brother for his name be the the glory
[1:41:46] that just shows
[1:41:47] me that God prepares everything
[1:41:52] before bringing out his plan for his
[1:41:55] name be the
[1:41:58] glory when God spoke to Elijah and said
[1:42:02] he said go go tell Ahab it will not
[1:42:07] rain for three years uh and six
[1:42:10] months until
[1:42:12] you until you say
[1:42:14] it notice notice what God is telling him
[1:42:18] until you until the
[1:42:22] prophet until he says it
[1:42:24] again until he says it again he says
[1:42:28] you
[1:42:31] quickly go to the Jordan go to the
[1:42:34] Jordan I have a creek there that's
[1:42:36] flowing with
[1:42:38] water and go there go hide there go go
[1:42:42] and be
[1:42:44] there and I have given
[1:42:47] orders
[1:42:49] notice and I have given given
[1:42:52] orders to to some
[1:42:57] Ravens I know who
[1:43:00] spoke about
[1:43:03] Jonah how that little small will
[1:43:07] began began to
[1:43:11] grow because God Was preparing something
[1:43:14] for
[1:43:15] it it was a special
[1:43:19] well it was not just any
[1:43:22] well but it was a special
[1:43:25] well and God has prepared
[1:43:28] it inside of its
[1:43:31] belly that Jonah the prophet would be
[1:43:33] inside of it because
[1:43:36] Jonah was going to be the
[1:43:39] representation of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:43:42] because Jesus
[1:43:45] said that's like Jonah the prophet was
[1:43:48] in the belly of the well for three
[1:43:49] nights three days and three nights so
[1:43:51] the son of
[1:43:52] man shall be in the womb of the Earth
[1:43:56] for three days and three
[1:43:58] nights so God began to prepare that
[1:44:01] little small
[1:44:02] fish so God began to prepare these
[1:44:08] crows and I've ordered these crows
[1:44:11] Ravens to go and feed
[1:44:13] you it was just not any any
[1:44:16] food it was
[1:44:19] bread and it was meat
[1:44:22] how many you like
[1:44:25] meat I'll tell you one
[1:44:28] thing I was raised in a very humble
[1:44:32] home and I wasn't asked to be raised in
[1:44:35] a humble
[1:44:36] home but he put me in that humble
[1:44:39] home I like a lot of those
[1:44:42] Kos there is a soft drink that's
[1:44:47] called because my father would come home
[1:44:49] at 8:00 at night
[1:44:52] we were five in the family and he was
[1:44:54] the
[1:44:56] six I was orphan as as a young man we

[1:45:04] him and he would bring six loaf of
[1:45:07] bread that was our
[1:45:10] dinner and I have I'm not shamed having
[1:45:14] shame to say I was born in a humble
[1:45:17] home I know what poverty is
[1:45:21] I know what poverty
[1:45:23] is I know what I didn't
[1:45:27] have that's why I
[1:45:29] help when God gives me something

[1:45:35] it because I know what God has brought
[1:45:38] me out
[1:45:38] of I am I am
[1:45:41] happy I'm thankful with the
[1:45:44] Lord nothing in this

[1:49:10] preach what's the
[1:49:11] truth what the Bible
[1:49:14] says without Holiness no one shall see
[1:49:19] God you shall cleanse yourself from your
[1:49:22] sin by the blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:49:26] Christ you should cleanse you from your

[1:49:42] knew each
[1:49:44] other the Widow didn't know
[1:49:46] Elijah and Elijah didn't know the Widow
[1:49:53] but she must have been an honorable
[1:50:00] woman she must have been the same type
[1:50:03] or caliber as that
[1:50:08] man God chose that
[1:50:10] woman amongst all that woman in
[1:50:13] Israel to attend his
[1:50:17] Prophet when say when Jesus was here on
[1:50:20] Earth he
[1:50:22] said there was a lot of widows in the
[1:50:25] time of
[1:50:27] Elijah but none of them went to
[1:50:31] Elijah but only that Widow there are
[1:50:34] zerath and sidon
[1:50:37] why because he had everything
[1:50:39] prepared his name be the glory amen
[1:50:44] amen he went there to the
[1:50:49] barrel sh had a handful of
[1:50:52] flour she goes to the barrel of
[1:50:56] oil to see how much oil she had
[1:51:01] left and then she only had a little bit
[1:51:03] of oil
[1:51:05] left that's all that she had left
[1:51:08] between her and
[1:51:13] death I suppose she was praying all
[1:51:16] night blessed be the name of the
[1:51:18] Lord
[1:51:21] I suppose she was praying all
[1:51:23] night she had nothing
[1:51:26] left blessed be the name of our
[1:51:30] Lord so the creek dries up over
[1:51:33] there and Was preparing something over
[1:51:37] here he gives him the instructions go to
[1:51:40] zerath and
[1:51:41] Sid there is a
[1:51:45] widow I have given orders to feed
[1:51:48] you blessed be the name of the Lord am
[1:51:53] amen so here comes
[1:51:56] Elijah he's
[1:51:58] walking here he's
[1:52:01] walking he gets to a certain
[1:52:06] point and he's starting to see what God
[1:52:08] has show him over there where she
[1:52:11] was she saw a woman was
[1:52:16] thin with her clothing worn out
[1:52:21] picking up two
[1:52:24] sticks Elijah saw
[1:52:27] her and gave thanks to
[1:52:30] God this is the place where you have
[1:52:32] sent
[1:52:33] me so he
[1:52:36] says he says or he tells
[1:52:39] that I pray that you may bring me a
[1:52:42] vessel of water
[1:52:45] drink and says the the woman discern the
[1:52:48] man
[1:52:50] and notice that he was a good
[1:52:54] man he says yes I will share the little
[1:52:56] bit of
[1:52:59] water it seem like he's a good
[1:53:02] man so when she
