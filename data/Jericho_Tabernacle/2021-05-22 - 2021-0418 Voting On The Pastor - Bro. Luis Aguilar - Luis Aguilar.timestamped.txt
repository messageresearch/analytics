[47:39] i kind of want to say something here
[47:41] before we begin
[47:46] we as sort of an apology
[48:03] i know some people might have
[48:05] disagreements
[48:08] and some might be in agreement
[48:12] but let us be in one accord here this
[48:14] morning
[48:18] we don't want to offend anybody
[48:21] we don't want to hurt anyone we're just
[48:24] trying to do the best
[48:25] that we can as humans
[48:30] and to do it the closest we can to the
[48:32] word of god
[48:41] amen amen ephesians the fourth chapter
[48:46] starting on the verse seven comenzano
[48:48] conversiculosiete
[48:49] but unto every one of us is giving grace
[48:51] according to the measure
[48:53] of the gift of christ
[48:59] wherefore he saith when he ascended up
[49:01] on high
[49:03] he led captive captivity captive and
[49:05] gave gifts on to men
[49:13] now that he ascended what is excuse me
[49:16] now what that he ascended what is it
[49:18] but also he also descended first into
[49:20] the lower parts of the earth
[49:29] he descended in the same also that
[49:31] ascended up far above all heavens that
[49:33] he might fill
[49:34] all things
[49:40] and he gave some apostles some prophets
[49:44] some evangelists some pastors and
[49:47] teachers
[49:52] evangelists pastors
[49:55] for the perfecting of the saints for the
[49:57] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[49:59] the body of christ
[50:01] till we all come in unity of faith and
[50:04] of the knowledge of the son of god onto
[50:05] a perfect man unto the measure of the
[50:07] stature of the fullness of christ
[50:09] affine de perfectionara los santos
[50:38] talking about the ministry of christ the
[50:40] ministry gifts of christ
[50:41] to his body ablando del ministerio de
[50:43] los dones de cristo al cuerpo
[50:45] and and once again it's to his body
[50:50] he says he gave every one of his uh
[50:53] everyone a gift according uh with
[50:56] measure
[50:59] everyone has a measurement
[51:03] it is a gift of christ he uh
[51:07] he gave some apostles some prophets
[51:11] and some evangelists some pastors and
[51:13] teachers
[51:14] pastors now there's a reason why he sent
[51:17] forth a five-fold ministry
[51:22] he didn't just send the fight forward
[51:24] ministry for the so
[51:26] that apostle no solomon
[51:29] or for the prophet or for the evangelist
[51:33] or for some pastors or teachers maestros
[51:36] to just
[51:37] to wear a nice suit and tie but
[51:42] there's a purpose why he sent the
[51:43] five-fold ministries
[51:46] and in verse 12 the pastor paul says it
[51:50] is for the perfecting
[51:54] the saints perfection for the perfecting
[51:57] of the saints
[52:00] for the edifying of the body of christ
[52:05] that's why that's why there's a fightful
[52:07] minister
[52:09] and we understand that that tapes are
[52:11] good antennae
[52:14] but we need the five-fold ministry but
[52:30] and i'm going to insert something right
[52:31] here what the bernie says
[52:35] and the message uh if i'm not mistaken
[52:39] the story of his life he said mexico
[52:42] mexico has found a six-fold ministry
[52:49] i'm going to let you meditate on that
[52:52] mexico has had a six-fold ministry
[52:54] mexico and control
[52:55] ministerial he said brother bernie said
[52:57] we would go to mexico vamos
[53:13] el trista the one who goes to go tour
[53:16] around the city
[53:20] to go for a vacation there's not a
[53:23] six-fold ministry no ayun sexto
[53:25] ministerio
[53:25] pastor paul says it is for the
[53:27] perfecting of the saints
[53:31] or the edifying of the body of christ
[53:36] till we all come into a unity
[54:10] and unto the measure of the stature of
[54:11] the fullness of christ
[54:15] we all have our disagreements we
[54:18] we might have all of our agreements
[54:22] but as brother brother branham says
[54:25] hermano brandon
[54:26] he said we can barely disagree with one
[54:29] another
[54:33] but we still shake each other's hands
[54:35] god bless you todd
[55:17] a man a man well brother i don't i don't
[55:19] believe he's coming in a cloud
[55:22] i don't believe he's coming in a horse
[55:26] we still believe that he's coming back
[55:30] amen amen there was there was a
[55:34] i'm going to go real fast we were in
[55:37] jeffersonville one time established

[1:03:53] that's the way it was did in the bible
[1:03:55] time
[1:03:57] therefore we feel that no one person
[1:04:01] is a dictator or something in the church
[1:04:06] we don't want that no what did brother
[1:04:09] brian say katy put him on a branch we
[1:04:10] don't want that no
[1:04:12] every man every person got a persona
[1:04:15] myself
[1:04:16] yo mismo and voting anyone botando
[1:04:20] and just got one vote solo tengo un
[1:04:23] boto
[1:04:36] just like any other person in the church
[1:04:37] here personally
[1:05:34] brother neville thinks this man would be
[1:05:36] a right man
[1:05:39] or the trustee board thinks this this
[1:05:42] man would be a right man
[1:05:46] it has to be the church
[1:06:02] one more time it's the sovereignty
[1:06:05] and the law of the church
[1:06:09] by the word of god before they just
[1:06:12] can't say that i think this man will be
[1:06:14] a right man
[1:06:30] no one
[1:06:36] that's the minister that's the trustee
[1:06:38] that's the elder el minister
[1:06:40] from the biggest to the smallest no one
[1:06:43] does
[1:06:44] anything in himself
[1:06:47] is the vote of the church it's a
[1:06:49] sovereign church
[1:06:51] and this church is sovereign there ain't
[1:06:54] no board of trustees or deacons going to
[1:06:56] tell you what to do
[1:07:08] there's no board of trustees or deacons
[1:07:10] going to tell you what to do
[1:07:32] and there's two or three people getting
[1:07:33] something against the pastor
[1:07:37] they can't raise up with their deacons
[1:07:39] and trustees
[1:07:53] if he's the assistant pastor he's got
[1:07:57] one vote
[1:07:58] he's just like the lane member como los
[1:08:00] lycos that sits back there
[1:08:02] yeah he just got one vote that's all
[1:08:06] if he's the assistant pastor he's just
[1:08:09] got one vote
[1:08:11] he's just like the lame member that sits
[1:08:13] back there esc
[1:08:16] the whole vote of the church settles the
[1:08:19] matter el boto de la iglesia
[1:08:21] a regla that's
[1:08:36] put a deacon board out on pastor
[1:08:41] the church does that la iglesia in a
[1:08:44] general vote of the whole thing
[1:08:48] it's sovereign in itself
[1:09:00] amen amen he's the bishop the general
[1:09:03] overseer
[1:09:20] you all voted a hundred percent on it
[1:09:24] so we held right up to that entonces
[1:09:28] the church is sovereign what the church
[1:09:32] says
[1:09:32] local
[1:10:01] and we like that because we have no
[1:10:04] bishops
[1:10:06] hierarchies here or overseers
[1:10:08] supervisors or so
[1:10:10] forth to tell us tell us this or that or
[1:10:13] the other
[1:10:27] so how do we know if god
[1:10:35] how does one know the rightful position
[1:10:37] in the body of christ
[1:10:43] that's a good one at the moment very
[1:10:45] good muy buena how does
[1:10:47] that be kind of a question amongst us
[1:10:49] many of us here tonight
[1:10:54] how do you rightfully no como los aves
[1:10:57] now i'm presuming that this brother
[1:10:59] wants to know
[1:11:02] what position what in christ what part
[1:11:04] of christ do i play
[1:11:06] position
[1:11:09] now for instance i like to say this for
[1:11:12] example
[1:11:13] brother to give you the best answer i
[1:11:15] know hermano
[1:11:18] your position in christ revealed to you
[1:11:20] by the holy spirit
[1:11:23] and then if you want to know whether
[1:11:25] it's the holy spirit or not
[1:11:29] find out whether he blesses what you're
[1:11:31] doing or not
[1:11:36] and if you want to know whether it's the
[1:11:37] holy spirit or not
[1:11:41] find out whether he blesses you what
[1:11:43] you're doing
[1:11:47] and if he blesses it then that's him
[1:11:51] and if he doesn't bless
[1:11:54] that's a pause and i'm not adding
[1:11:59] but i believe brother graham is saying
[1:12:00] that's not god
[1:12:03] so always do this brethren whenever you
[1:12:07] feel that you're supposed to do a thing
[1:12:10] first find out if it's scriptural for
[1:12:12] for for you to do it
[1:12:16] if it's in the scriptures not just
[1:12:19] wrote right in one place no
[1:12:22] but i mean completely scriptural through
[1:12:24] the bible for you to do it
[1:12:29] your position to position say say if you
[1:12:33] be an evangelist
[1:12:33] the grammar sustainability
[1:12:49] of the nine spiritual gifts in the
[1:12:50] church
[1:12:52] and the four spiritual offices of the
[1:12:54] church
[1:12:57] any position first see if it's
[1:13:00] a first see if god called
[1:13:17] that they're professing
[1:13:21] see god will work with this creature the
[1:13:23] way he's made him
[1:13:28] so i i watch him says yolo mirror
[1:13:48] if you see him real flighty and going on
[1:13:51] silver
[1:13:52] fribolo and he says the lord called me
[1:13:55] for so at such to be a pastor
[1:13:57] senor yamado para talcosaur
[1:14:01] if you see real flighty and going on
[1:14:05] he says the lord called me for so as
[1:14:07] such to be a pastor
[1:14:11] now a pastor can't be a flighty person
[1:14:16] a pastor solid and sound um
[1:14:20] see ben god called me to be a teacher
[1:14:25] and watch a teacher
[1:14:31] he gets all mixed up and everything else
[1:14:35] then you can tell but the thing to do
[1:14:39] your position is is usually known
[1:14:41] whether you can do it
[1:14:42] or not
[1:14:46] your position is usually known
[1:14:51] you can do it or not
[1:14:54] now
[1:15:07] staying at home here would just be
[1:15:17] and there's no one there's none of them
[1:15:19] left here tonight
[1:15:22] i wanted
[1:15:30] and there's no one there's none of them
[1:15:32] here left tonight
[1:15:36] that they cried and went out there on
[1:15:37] 1717 spring street
[1:15:42] spring and the lady mrs hawkins over
[1:15:44] here
[1:15:46] hawkins met me instead crying during the
[1:15:48] time of depression
[1:15:53] one in the neighborhood will cook a mess
[1:15:55] of beans and we'll come and eat
[1:15:57] from that
[1:16:01] she said i'll allowance my children at
[1:16:04] the table if you can only build a
[1:16:05] tabernacle
[1:16:10] and my calling was an evangelist
[1:16:14] laying right here at this cornerstone
[1:16:15] acosta
[1:16:17] if we could burst in here tonight
[1:16:21] you'll see a fly leaf of my bible here
[1:16:24] us
[1:16:26] where he told me to be an evangelist
[1:16:30] and i wasn't a successful pastor enough
[1:16:49] because i haven't got the patience what
[1:16:50] it takes to be a pastor
[1:16:54] so therefore if i try to if i try to
[1:16:57] pasture
[1:16:59] i would just be as far out as a pastor
[1:17:01] trying to be an evangelist
[1:17:05] see what i mean you can see the way the
[1:17:08] lord calls you
[1:17:11] what your position is in the body
[1:17:15] we read quotes about praying over the
[1:17:17] decision
[1:17:20] we read codes of the sovereign church
[1:17:24] and we just read the quotes of knowing
[1:17:26] the position of our body in christ
[1:17:37] god honor this man i know it is the
[1:17:40] choice lord as a sovereign church
[1:17:42] is
[1:17:59] this portion of this service in a
[1:18:01] special way in what righteous and holy
[1:18:03] name of jesus
[1:18:09] jesus now with our heads bowed
[1:18:12] not only with our heads but our hearts
[1:18:14] no solos
[1:18:16] and as every member of this church
[1:18:19] that comes here regularly and supports
[1:18:21] it with your tithe and offerings
[1:18:38] which is considered a member of this
[1:18:40] church
[1:18:43] while the pastor and i mean along looks
[1:18:47] the associate pastor uh solo aqui pastor
[1:18:50] associates
[1:18:53] i will ask if the church finds brother
[1:18:55] taylor to be a just man and eligible
[1:18:59] hermano taylor said by the best
[1:19:03] of your thinking
[1:19:06] over this group of people you will
[1:19:09] signify the same by raising your hand
[1:19:11] significa
[1:19:13] now if there is any contrary
[1:19:17] will you raise your hand
[1:19:20] before
[1:19:45] is the same caliber of a pastor
[1:19:57] [Music]
[1:20:12] so what happens when we vote
[1:20:16] the majority vote wins
[1:20:19] [Music]
[1:20:22] so what is what if it's uh 50 with 51.
[1:20:30] the majority vote wins
[1:20:34] that's what the prophet told us
[1:20:37] if one of that one act that one voted
[1:20:39] for no
[1:20:42] no if that one voted for yes
[1:20:46] it's yes someone says everything is
[1:20:48] we're reading the codes for brother
[1:20:49] branham
[1:20:53] everyone has their ideas i understand
[1:20:56] everyone has their thoughts
[1:20:59] we're trying to do our best to rely on
[1:21:01] ourselves what the prophet of god says
[1:21:06] then i come down and i felt the feeling
[1:21:08] of the church entonces
[1:21:12] and felt the feeling of the church
[1:21:16] de la iglesia that the church in the
[1:21:18] majority iglesias
[1:21:21] seemed to want it this is brother
[1:21:24] brandon
[1:21:25] then what did i do anton says what did i
[1:21:29] do
[1:21:29] okay if the church wanted it
[1:21:33] what did i do can you say yo i
[1:21:35] sacrificed my own thoughts yo sacrifice
[1:21:39] if the church wanted it i'd be like
[1:21:55] i sacrificed my thoughts your sacrifice
[1:21:59] and i throw it in with the church sure
[1:22:02] let's do it again that's the way we cast
[1:22:05] lots
[1:22:08] that's the way was in the bible time
[1:22:10] cisco fuels the impossibility the way
[1:22:11] the church voted
[1:22:14] the sovereignty of the groups of people
[1:22:17] they come together in unity
[1:22:20] there are strengths in unity
[1:22:37] certainly if that's what the church
[1:22:38] wants sierra mentions
[1:22:40] if that is god is wanting he's got more
[1:22:44] authority to vote among the whole group
[1:22:45] of people
[1:22:49] than he has to me
[1:23:43] that should be the motive of every
[1:23:46] christian
[1:23:54] wow wow that ain't clear i'm sorry
[1:23:58] i'm behind it you do all that i
[1:24:29] votes for him that is what we
[1:24:32] stand for
[1:24:37] if there is a more clear brothers si no
[1:24:40] es mas laro que sormanos
[1:24:41] if you want to see that brother luis is
[1:24:42] lying with them
[1:24:49] you're going to offend me then say for
[1:24:52] instance
[1:24:54] we want to change something in the
[1:24:56] church
[1:24:58] well then if the trustees wants to and
[1:25:00] that somebody
[1:25:01] else wants to bueno
[1:25:04] persona the deacons they want to change
[1:25:06] something
[1:25:08] that comes before the church
[1:25:28] seems to be a little different than what
[1:25:29] the whole church said
[1:25:33] let's sacrifice that idea sacrifice idea
[1:25:41] if my idea see me there is different
[1:25:44] as different from all of yours i don't
[1:25:47] care who i am
[1:25:49] important you preach really good
[1:25:51] brothers
[1:26:32] and if our idea here seems to be a
[1:26:34] little different
[1:26:35] what the whole church is
[1:26:39] let's sacrifice that idea
[1:26:42] because that's the only way we can stand
[1:26:46] united is
[1:26:54] [Music]
[1:27:00] we'll just go on on your way going now
[1:27:02] is
[1:27:13] if this church will just go on the way
[1:27:15] you're going nowhere
[1:27:32] if the church continues the way we're
[1:27:35] going
[1:27:37] united together it's eliminated what god
[1:27:40] would do
[1:27:42] if we stick together
[1:27:54] and then so complete in the hands of god
[1:27:59] amen amen
[1:28:02] i suggest brother neville to be pastor
[1:28:04] of the church
[1:28:08] as long as as long as the church
[1:28:10] suggests them being pastored
[1:28:27] as long as he holds the post of duty and
[1:28:30] stays with the faith
[1:28:34] wants to come and feels the leading of
[1:28:35] the lord
[1:28:38] then the leading of the lord will the
[1:28:40] leading of the lord for him to stay
[1:28:41] direction
[1:28:43] then the leading of the lord for him to
[1:28:45] stay direction
[1:28:47] what is the leading of the lord for him
[1:28:48] to stay direction

[1:28:54] congregation

[1:29:13] of praying over the decision that this
[1:29:16] is a sovereign church
[1:29:19] how to know the position on the body of

[1:29:47] the way we conduct ourselves in here are
[1:29:49] like christians

[1:54:26] or pastor brother johnny uh
[1:54:30] you know
[1:54:35] when we bought it for brother johnny it
[1:54:37] was a lot easier
[1:54:41] we were all here because of him
[1:54:48] but the lord had a change of heart
[1:54:53] maybe not a change of heart but a change
[1:54:56] of plan
[1:55:00] and he threw us all a curve
[1:55:06] and we we had to
[1:55:10] we had to stand at the crossroads
[1:55:15] and go forward
[1:55:19] but i do have some some comments i'd
[1:55:21] like to
[1:55:22] go over with you pero si tengo nos
[1:55:24] comentarios lo cual es quieres
[1:55:26] espressados

[1:55:36] a real long week
[1:55:40] there's three things three things you
[1:55:42] might uh
[1:55:43] have questions about uh
[1:55:54] my experience my experience my plans for
[1:55:57] the future
[1:55:57] miss planet i'll try and go over them
[1:56:00] really fast
[1:56:04] as mentioned last week
[1:56:07] how i spoke last year
[1:56:12] i'm not someone that was born in the
[1:56:13] message
[1:56:16] or from a religious family
[1:56:20] i don't have a name like others do not
[1:56:25] i am the only one in my sight of the
[1:56:27] family who has received
[1:56:29] this precious message of grace
[1:56:37] only one thing i can tell you is i love
[1:56:39] the lord
[1:56:40] and have tried to serve him
[1:56:47] in every job post i have been placed
[1:56:54] i have been pl uh blessed to have a
[1:56:56] career that has allowed me to attend
[1:56:58] almost
[1:56:59] every service and to be
[1:57:02] in every in my post of duty
[1:57:13] the type of work i have done the last 22
[1:57:16] years
[1:57:17] it allowed me to work every day
[1:57:21] or any day i wanted but i decided to
[1:57:24] follow jesus
[1:57:26] and the message of the hour first
[1:57:39] i have tried to be as honest as i could
[1:57:42] in the work that i do
[1:57:48] i have worked with some of you guys
[1:58:04] please talk to me and tell me what i
[1:58:06] have done
[1:58:14] my life has revolved around the service
[1:58:17] of the lord
[1:58:18] and by doing so i have served the lord's
[1:58:20] bride
[1:58:28] the message teaches us to serve where
[1:58:31] you are needed
[1:58:32] and to be faithful faithful
[1:58:36] faithful to your post of duty
[1:58:46] if
[1:58:47] [Music]
[1:58:52] you may say i haven't heard him preach i
[1:58:55] wasn't
[1:58:55] asked to preach
[1:59:02] i have served in other positions
[1:59:06] in el paso tabernacle i was asked to
[1:59:09] preach
[1:59:10] and song need in spanish
[1:59:21] tabernacle you might remember i am not
[1:59:23] very good at it
[1:59:24] but i was obedient to my pastor
[1:59:28] damien
[1:59:42] pastor
[1:59:46] the last three months
[1:59:50] i only spoke once
[1:59:53] you might ask why
[1:59:57] because if i would have spoken and take
[1:59:59] in the pulpit
[2:00:00] i would have been accused of taking
[2:00:03] advantage of the situation
[2:00:13] my friends when i speak i want to repeat
[2:00:16] what our prophet spoke and be a vessel
[2:00:20] that the lord can use to re reach
[2:00:23] each one of you
[2:00:38] what really matters is how well you
[2:00:41] encourage
[2:00:42] lead and by example
[2:00:45] and serve the members
[2:00:52] of
[2:00:56] what we did when our pastor brother
[2:00:58] johnny was called
[2:01:00] by the lord is to encourage our young
[2:01:03] ministers with the help of our elders
[2:01:18] we asked them to preach and preach the
[2:01:20] best they could
[2:01:24] predict
[2:01:28] because we were at a crossroads
[2:01:32] we told them we were expecting only the
[2:01:34] best from them
[2:01:35] and we were going to use them in every
[2:01:38] opportunity
[2:01:39] we could and we expected them to do
[2:01:41] their best to serve
[2:01:43] the members of our church
[2:02:18] who are asked to keep the flock together
[2:02:21] and
[2:02:22] take them to the master
[2:02:27] junto the lord jesus christ
[2:02:31] and every member is important
[2:02:38] i have also asked the deacons to be at
[2:02:40] their post of duty and to be ready
[2:02:43] to preach if called
[2:02:53] i have not asked for more than what i
[2:02:55] have already done
[2:02:56] and am doing no pedigree
