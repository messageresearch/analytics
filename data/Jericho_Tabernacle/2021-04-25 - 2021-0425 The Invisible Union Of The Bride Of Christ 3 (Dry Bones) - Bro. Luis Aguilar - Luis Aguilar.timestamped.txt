[35:28] oh
[35:30] [Music]
[35:48] hello
[35:53] i'm sorry i'm a little nervous
[35:58] so before i was about to give my
[36:01] testimony
[36:03] i asked god to give me a sign that this
[36:07] was the right time
[36:11] and when the sisters saying there's
[36:13] power in prayer
[36:17] i know this was my sign
[36:21] because my testimony is about power and
[36:24] prayer
[36:33] [Music]
[36:38] and everyone was so happy for us
[36:44] because we told them on mother's day
[36:49] and at 12 weeks
[36:52] i went to get my first ultrasound yeah
[36:56] and they told me i was healthy the baby
[36:58] was looking good everything was perfect
[37:05] but at 14 weeks
[37:11] i ended up getting a sharp pain on my
[37:13] back
[37:17] so i went to the emergency room just to
[37:18] make sure everything was okay
[37:20] with me or the baby
[37:25] and they told me i was fine nothing was
[37:28] wrong i just had an infection so they
[37:29] gave me pills
[37:30] and that was it
[37:37] the following week at 15 weeks i had
[37:40] another sharp pain
[37:46] and i went again to the hospital
[37:49] and they told me again nothing was wrong
[37:54] and that the baby was fine healthy as
[37:56] well
[37:59] and the following week i'm not even
[38:02] kidding
[38:03] it happen every week they're at
[38:06] 16 weeks
[38:12] i went again
[38:16] but this time it was because i couldn't
[38:18] even stand up
[38:23] i was in so much pain
[38:26] and when the doctor checked did an
[38:30] ultrasound
[38:33] he told me my baby he couldn't find my
[38:35] baby at all
[38:39] and that was my worst fear
[38:52] but they told me he was in position to
[38:55] come out already
[38:58] in the position and he was only 16 weeks
[39:02] yeah so
[39:06] i don't know what they did but it was
[39:08] really painful
[39:12] and they sent me on my way
[39:14] [Music]
[39:17] i the following week i had another
[39:20] sharp pain but it was on my back and i
[39:22] was on my way to my mother-in-law's
[39:26] house
[39:30] and i remember texting sister brenda to
[39:32] pray for me
[39:36] and she did
[39:39] and on my way home from sister from my
[39:43] mother-in-law i'm sorry
[39:50] i had another pain yeah
[39:53] but it was 10 times worse
[39:58] and i remember the song this blood came
[40:01] out
[40:05] on the spit on the radio
[40:09] and i remember i just started crying
[40:14] because i remember something brother
[40:16] branham said
[40:17] that you have to claim your healing in
[40:19] order to be healed
[40:25] and i remember telling my husband let's
[40:28] pray because
[40:28] i know this is he wanted to take me to
[40:31] the hospital but i said no
[40:36] hospital
[40:42] i knew this was satan's work he was
[40:45] getting to me through my baby
[40:51] and i remember we started praying
[40:56] and i remember saying in the name of the
[40:59] lord jesus christ i claim my healing and
[41:01] say that you can't do anything about it
[41:09] and when i got out of the car the pain
[41:11] went away
[41:15] two weeks passed and i had no pain
[41:19] i knew this wasn't science this was
[41:21] satan
[41:25] and then sister brenda called me and
[41:26] told me she i believe she had to go to
[41:28] the hospital because of the same pain
[41:31] a brianna
[41:35] and i remember telling her this was
[41:37] satan was really mad
[41:42] for helping me and praying for me
[41:52] but my testimony is there is power and
[41:56] prayer
[41:56] if you're going through anything

[1:19:17] what makes the bride
[1:19:19] it's our surrender is
[1:20:02] from the east and the west and the north
[1:20:04] and the south occidental del norte also
[1:20:07] there is a uniting time and that's on
[1:20:10] right now what is she uniting for
[1:20:15] but the rapture
[1:20:19] amen amen that's why she's uniting
[1:20:21] herself
[1:20:23] because there's a rapture we understand
[1:20:26] according to
[1:20:27] first thessalonians uh
[1:21:25] it takes three things to take
[1:21:39] brother what do you mean it already
[1:21:40] happened
[1:21:44] i i believe we don't have a lot of uh
[1:21:46] new uh novites here
[1:21:51] the rapture is already going on
[1:21:54] and there's a lot of people that don't
[1:21:55] know that it's already going on
[1:22:00] because in the scripture of revelation
[1:22:02] 16
[1:22:03] apocalypses verse 15
[1:22:07] it says behold
[1:22:25] and that's the same thing with the lord
[1:22:26] jesus christ
[1:22:28] he comes as a thief
[1:22:32] the shout is the message
[1:22:36] the rapture is already happening
[1:22:40] there's a lot of people here that are uh
[1:22:42] on the earth
[1:22:44] that they don't even know about the
[1:22:45] message they don't know about malachi 4.
[1:22:51] they don't know that the rapture is is
[1:22:53] happening as we speak
[1:22:57] because he's coming as a thief
[1:23:00] and i like what the what the brother was
[1:23:02] singing here
[1:23:05] here in revelations the 15th verse akin
[1:23:08] apocalypse
[1:23:10] is as blessed as he says that watcheth
[1:23:15] and keepeth his garments and that's what
[1:23:18] the brother was singing
[1:23:19] yes watch your garments you say
[1:23:22] uh keep your garments
[1:23:26] that's what we should be doing taking
[1:23:29] care of them
[1:23:31] make sure we don't have a stain on them
[1:23:34] make sure we don't have a wrinkle on
[1:23:35] them
[1:23:37] because a lot of times when we're out
[1:23:40] there eating we once we leave the church
[1:23:44] and we have a white shirt we're eating
[1:24:00] garments
[1:24:03] the rapture is already happening
[1:24:07] some people don't know it and it's the
[1:24:10] same thing
[1:24:11] when the voice of the archangel happens
[1:24:43] but that's why we should be watching
[1:24:46] taking care of our garments
[1:24:50] we should be watching the signs of the
[1:24:51] time
[1:24:55] i'm going to say that again
[1:25:11] what are we waiting for esperamos the
[1:25:13] the seventh
[1:25:14] excuse me the sixth vision already
[1:25:15] happened
[1:25:17] what happens after that there is not
[1:25:20] another thing that's going to happen
[1:25:24] destruction of united
[1:26:05] to use the phrase uniting
[1:26:24] to bring back the faith that was one the
[1:26:26] once delivered to the saints
[1:26:31] there's the uniting of the word
[1:26:34] and to the faith that was once delivered
[1:26:39] to the saints
[1:26:41] santos but iran says bringing back
[1:26:44] disillusion
[1:26:46] now so there has there had to be a
[1:26:48] disunity at some point
[1:26:51] brother brahms says he was talking about
[1:26:53] when the first church was set in order
[1:26:59] it was inaugurated of the day of
[1:27:02] pentecost
[1:27:16] dead
[1:27:20] and was living among them just the same
[1:27:23] as he was before
[1:27:24] he ever died
[1:27:29] see they wasn't contending for some
[1:27:31] historical affair
[1:27:35] historical they were contending for a
[1:27:37] living christ
[1:27:40] a resurrected one who was in their midst
[1:27:43] el cual esta see that's what brother
[1:27:46] branham is talking about
[1:27:48] branham bringing us back to the first
[1:27:50] church regresandonos
[1:27:53] that was inaugurated the day of
[1:27:54] pentecost
[1:27:58] says this
[1:28:15] uniting again bringing us back to the
[1:28:17] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:28:19] saints
[1:28:22] that it started in the day of pentecost
[1:28:27] now how do we get back to the original
[1:28:29] pentecostal faith
[1:28:34] says malachi 4.
[1:28:40] restore back the original pentecost of
[1:28:42] faith
[1:28:45] back to the people with the same
[1:28:46] pentecostal message
[1:28:51] the same pentecostal signs
[1:28:54] the same
[1:29:03] everything exactly with the vindication
[1:29:06] of the same pillar of fire that struck
[1:29:08] saw
[1:29:32] bring back the faith of the children
[1:29:34] back to the fathers
[1:30:04] and say luke 1 17 and san lucas
[1:30:08] he said he should go before him in the
[1:30:09] spirit of the power of elias
[1:30:16] and to turn the hearts of the father to
[1:30:17] the children
[1:30:54] is to return the faith of the fathers
[1:30:56] the children back to the fathers
[1:31:21] see this this this elijah this prophet
[1:31:23] is
[1:31:24] the prophet this prophet is no joke
[1:31:27] he's he's somebody else he's or he's a
[1:31:30] real man of god
[1:31:33] he's very calm but he's very strong
[1:31:37] if you notice in second kings
[1:31:41] i like i like reading the scriptures
[1:31:45] we find that the successor of elijah el
[1:31:48] succesor de elias was elisha for eliseo
[1:31:51] and he kept following elijah he said
[1:31:55] and he said what do you want she's like
[1:31:57] me he says i'm just trying to follow you
[1:31:59] no mosquito i'm going to keep following
[1:32:02] you
[1:32:04] and there you came elijah to the jordan
[1:32:05] river
[1:32:08] he knew that elijah was going to leave
[1:32:10] the scene el salvia
[1:32:12] and then he said what do you want i want
[1:32:16] a double portion of your spirit
[1:32:19] you asked for really great things
[1:32:24] very great things
[1:32:51] where is the god of elijah
[1:33:00] where the water was poisoned or it was
[1:33:02] there was something wrong with the water
[1:33:06] they put salt
[1:33:11] and finally we find him in a we find him
[1:33:14] in a predicament
[1:33:16] in a dilemma but rather he's not in a
[1:33:17] predicament
[1:33:19] we find those who are
[1:33:34] man you're challenging god inside the
[1:33:38] mask
[1:33:40] i'm going to teach that preacher a piece
[1:33:42] of my mind
[1:33:45] that's not the right attitude to correct
[1:33:48] better be careful
[1:34:01] god's word shall never
[1:34:12] we find that syria is a war against
[1:34:15] israel and controversy
[1:34:16] syria and this king was warring against
[1:34:21] israel
[1:34:24] israel and then we find that them
[1:34:28] it says the man of god hilo and
[1:34:30] controversy
[1:34:44] because these syrians are going to come
[1:34:45] and attack you
[1:34:48] and he did what exactly what elijah said
[1:34:52] and they were safe we find out that now
[1:34:55] that the heart of the king of syria
[1:34:58] say it again the heart of the king of
[1:34:59] syria
[1:35:02] syria was troubled and he said
[1:35:05] show me who is the king of israel
[1:35:09] israel and one one servant told this
[1:35:12] king of syria you
[1:35:26] king of israel
[1:35:30] the word that he speaks in his bed
[1:35:32] chambers
[1:35:35] so you can't hide anything from the
[1:35:36] prophet
[1:35:38] anything from him nope
[1:35:54] and the king of syria says well go get
[1:35:55] him
[1:35:58] go get him then i want him
[1:36:02] they finally go and we find elisha in
[1:36:05] the in the town of dothan
[1:36:08] if you
[1:36:17] horses and chariots and a great army
[1:36:19] against elijah
[1:36:30] [Music]
[1:36:35] saw all this great army that was coming
[1:36:37] to attack him
[1:36:40] carlos and he said master maestro what
[1:36:43] shall we do
[1:36:45] i can imagine elijah just probably just
[1:36:47] taking scratching his eye
[1:36:48] imagine the question
[1:37:46] begin
[1:37:59] and the lord open his eyes
[1:38:28] he's protecting the word of god
[1:38:31] he's not obligated to any man
[1:38:35] he's only obligated to his word
[1:38:38] you do his words obligated to fulfill
[1:38:42] the promises
[1:39:10] do that but give me a testimony
[1:39:15] a testimonial where you can go to a
[1:39:16] sister that you stopped talking to
[1:39:18] putin that hit a little bit didn't it
[1:39:37] but we can't even say hello to those who
[1:39:40] don't even talk to us
[1:39:46] the word is bringing us together
[1:39:48] [Music]
[1:39:50] that god did sent forth his holy spirit
[1:39:52] to heal us
[1:39:55] nothing but the truth but what is it
[1:39:58] what is it good to have all this healing
[1:40:01] bro
[1:40:03] we can't be united as a bride
[1:40:34] is
[1:41:02] no it's 50.
[1:41:09] think about that one bride unannovia
[1:41:13] going to the center yen centro give me a
[1:41:15] testimony
[1:41:16] testimonial will you say brother no need
[1:41:19] i restored my relationship with my
[1:41:21] brother
[1:41:23] i restored the relationship with my
[1:41:25] sister
[1:41:27] that's what the prophet elijah came
[1:41:30] in
[1:41:44] hallelujah
[1:41:55] i'm like elijah this morning i'm like
[1:41:58] elisha this morning
[1:42:00] lord may you open their eyes
[1:42:05] malachi 4 will restore all things
[1:42:10] and bring us back to that same fate
[1:42:13] to bring us back not to the pentecostal
[1:42:16] church
[1:42:18] but back to the original pentecost of
[1:42:21] faith
[1:42:23] pentecost and the day of pentecost
[1:43:07] not to bring us back to the pentecostal
[1:43:09] church
[1:43:12] back to the original pentecost of faith
[1:43:19] the seed is not air with the shock noise
[1:43:37] is it looks like the seed but
[1:43:40] if you go to google google look at
[1:43:42] google shock
[1:43:45] shock is like a you ever seen um la
[1:43:48] cascara
[1:43:49] where you just kind of hold the seat
[1:43:51] inside
[1:43:54] it's like a pecan pecan you ever seen
[1:43:57] those pecans
[1:43:59] los picanos yo you got the you don't eat
[1:44:01] the you don't eat the shell
[1:44:02] us you crack it
[1:44:32] represents
[1:44:46] they just kept the shells thinking that
[1:44:50] was the seed
[1:44:53] the seed was rejected
[1:44:57] says the shot represents pentecost this
[1:45:00] is
[1:45:06] she was overshadowed by the holy ghost
[1:45:10] she was chosen after many women
[1:45:15] and then she had jesus inside of her elo
[1:45:18] she had the literal jesus inside of her
[1:45:21] al jesus
[1:45:23] she protected him he embraced she
[1:45:26] embraced him
[1:45:28] and then jesus came out of her yeah
[1:45:30] jesus
[1:45:31] now jesus was no longer in here
[1:45:35] but now jesus was with her and there we
[1:45:38] find where now
[1:45:39] mary and joseph lost jesus
[1:46:08] see where you left them
[1:46:22] and she claimed that she was the mother
[1:46:24] of jesus
[1:46:27] jesus said she she she said you and your
[1:46:30] father
[1:46:31] they said to padre your father and i
[1:46:34] have been looking for you
[1:46:36] but says wait a minute it is
[1:46:52] claiming that the birth wasn't
[1:46:53] supernatural
[1:46:59] joseph was her father father jesus
[1:47:03] she denied the supernatural birth
[1:47:35] they were all scattered in luther's
[1:47:36] group
[1:47:40] not luther himself
[1:47:43] not luther not wesley niluteroni wesley
[1:47:45] not these great founders
[1:48:16] so we're going to go back to the
[1:48:18] original faith of the father
[1:48:23] now you see but in the last days
[1:48:26] we see things happening now that has
[1:48:28] never happened before
[1:49:09] now remember that's that's right at the
[1:49:11] seven trumpets
[1:49:52] in the days of the message of the
[1:49:54] seventh angel
[1:50:34] to bring us back to the word
[1:50:50] it takes the prophet
[1:51:17] around them
[1:51:46] um
[1:52:13] that was the ark of the lord
[1:52:20] so what ezekiel saw on earth
[1:52:25] the apostle john saw already stationed
[1:52:27] in heaven
[1:52:41] john saw it in heaven
[1:52:44] ezekiel saw another vision
[1:52:48] where he was taken by the spirit
[1:52:52] and now we see him in a valley
[1:52:55] was full of dry bones
[1:52:59] but the scripture said it was they were
[1:53:00] very very dry
[1:53:04] usually bones um
[1:53:07] usually when we eat we usually throw the
[1:53:09] bone away
[1:53:52] can these
[1:54:30] the scripture said it was a big rattling
[1:54:32] a loud rattling of bones
[1:54:49] that is connecting the bones together
[1:54:53] bringing the body together
[1:54:57] so when i started hearing brother tiny
[1:54:59] speaking about arthritis
[1:55:02] is
[1:55:15] he said they coming together this is
[1:55:18] the tending's connecting the bones
[1:55:23] they were not just a skeleton put
[1:55:24] together
[1:55:27] but now they had flesh they had
[1:55:30] skin then
[1:56:12] that makes them a living
[1:57:08] god told
[1:57:35] where now adam and eve says or adam
[1:57:50] all his bones
[1:57:54] not one of them is broken
[1:57:57] john 19 36
[1:58:01] were done that the scripture should be
[1:58:05] fulfilled
[1:58:07] a bone of him shall not be broken
[1:58:12] the bone in hebrew means body
[1:58:15] significa life vida substance
[1:58:18] substantial
[1:58:20] self-same el mismo so when adam
[1:58:23] saw eve he said
[1:58:28] on my bone let me whistle he says i am
[1:58:30] you say yo
[1:58:32] and you are me
