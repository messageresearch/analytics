[24:35] 5
[24:37] [Music]
[24:40] uh uh Ephesians chap 1 verse 3-
[24:48] 5 and it reads in this
[24:54] [Music]
[24:57] manner
[25:22] lessed be the God and father of our Lord
[25:24] Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all
[25:27] spiritual blessings and and Heavenly
[25:28] places in Christ according as he hath
[25:31] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[25:33] of the world that we should be holy and
[25:36] Without Blame before him in love having
[25:38] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[25:40] children by Jesus Christ him to himself
[25:43] according to the good pleasure of his
[25:50] will the Lord
[25:53] add the reading of his word and may the
[25:56] Lord also bless the musicians for the
[26:03] work we're going to be taking a subject
[26:06] this
[26:12] evening which I would like to entitle it
[26:15] the manifestations of sons of God for
[26:17] the
[26:20] adoption the manifestation of the sons
[26:23] of God for
[26:27] adoption
[26:30] our pastor has been preaching um
[26:33] according to the subject of
[26:36] adoption and I believe it's a really
[26:38] deep
[26:39] subject and very
[26:42] extent but also very
[26:46] important the
[26:50] adoption the word adoption means uh
[26:52] location or
[26:54] uh the
[26:57] uh uh
[26:58] placing thank
[27:04] you we become the sons of
[27:09] God adopted by Jesus
[27:14] Christ how many of you know that God
[27:16] only has one
[27:18] son and that son is our Lord Jesus
[27:22] Christ we come to be
[27:26] children but adopt the children through
[27:29] our Lord Jesus
[27:33] Christ and then after going through a
[27:38] process then that's when we become
[27:47] adopted I'm going to go to the beginning
[27:50] so I can place a foundation
[27:53] here it's called the plan of
[27:57] God
[27:58] God had many
[28:01] plans The Plan of Salvation and
[28:05] restoration and in him were many
[28:09] attributes the attribute of being a
[28:13] father of being a son and also being the
[28:16] Holy
[28:17] Spirit to be a
[28:19] Healer to be a
[28:24] restorer there were many attributes to
[28:27] him
[28:31] and then and the only manner that he
[28:32] could be able to demonstrate or or play
[28:35] these
[28:37] roles he had to manifest
[28:41] it so in order for him to be a
[28:47] Healer first of all there had to be
[28:49] somebody to be
[28:50] heal in order for him to be able to
[28:55] hear in order for him to be able to be a
[28:57] savior
[29:02] there first of all had to be somebody to
[29:04] be
[29:05] lost in order for him to be a
[29:09] savior so that he can find that person
[29:12] who was
[29:15] lost so in the in that manner God
[29:18] started to to display his
[29:24] characteristics the word god means an
[29:27] object of worship
[29:32] so in order for him to be God there had
[29:33] to be somebody to worship
[29:36] him so in that manner he started to
[29:38] create the
[29:40] Angels the cherubin and the
[29:44] sarapin and all of the Heavenly
[29:49] Creatures and in the midst of all of
[29:51] that he created
[29:52] man he created the
[29:55] universe and he also created the Earth
[29:59] and in his mind he had the thought of
[30:01] creating
[30:05] man so God created this Earth so that
[30:08] man could live in
[30:15] this and so then when we come to see
[30:17] that when he created his Garden of Eden
[30:19] where he had headquarters here on
[30:23] Earth it was
[30:25] eternity there was peace there was no
[30:31] sicknesses and there was absolutely
[30:33] nothing to hinder
[30:36] man and so then when we go back to see
[30:39] how God created uh the
[30:42] creation God created the
[30:45] man he created the first
[30:48] Adam and he placed him there on Earth so
[30:51] that he can govern
[30:55] it so that he placed the man there so he
[30:58] can pretty much govern over all living
[31:03] creatures over beast and fish and
[31:05] everything that he had
[31:10] created and so then once we go back to
[31:13] reading the story of Adam and
[31:16] Eve how the fall came to
[31:26] be
[31:28] and then we come to see that the great
[31:30] battle had started back when Lucifer was
[31:35] around and then we come to see how he
[31:37] was cast out of heaven and was here on
[31:43] Earth and then in that man he's got and
[31:47] Anointed The
[31:52] Serpent and the prophet teaches us that
[31:54] it wasn't a reptile but a
[31:56] man it was a man who
[32:02] thought and the Bible says that he was
[32:04] the the wisest of all
[32:09] creatures and we come to see that the
[32:11] intelligence of
[32:14] this how he seduced
[32:18] Eve and then that's where the fall came
[32:21] to
[32:26] be that's where we find that that's
[32:29] where we try to go back to to return
[32:32] where we came
[32:34] from when Adam and Eve were in the
[32:36] Garden of
[32:40] Eden they were hidden behind a holy
[32:46] Veil and they were controlled by a
[32:48] divine
[32:52] nature and in there there was no
[32:54] sicknesses or anything to hinder them
[32:57] but but then after the fall
[32:59] came
[33:02] that's and then after that fall that's
[33:05] when they were uh exiled from the garden
[33:07] of
[33:13] v and so we come to see that man has
[33:15] tried to return back to that state of
[33:20] being being in that divine
[33:25] nature trying to avoid being in this
[33:27] Fallen nature that we're
[33:33] in and return back to that divine nature
[33:36] that it once
[33:38] had through our Lord Jesus
[33:45] Christ and so we see that God in his
[33:48] plan wanted to restore restore all
[33:52] things and he sent his son onto the
[33:56] Earth
[33:58] with the mission that he would be able
[34:00] to fulfill out that
[34:07] purpose and as we see that he fulfilled
[34:10] his
[34:13] part so then it falls in our lot to be
[34:16] able to fulfill that purpose in our
[34:18] Liv and it's through a a certain process
[34:22] for us to be able to complete
[34:26] it
[34:30] and so God began to see throughout all
[34:32] the Earth who would be worthy of this
[34:37] work and he saw that the Angels weren't
[34:39] able to do it since they were from a
[34:41] different
[34:43] [Music]
[34:45] race and the Animals weren't able to
[34:47] accomplish
[34:51] it and so it turns out that he was the
[34:54] one that had to come down and do the job
[35:00] and create himself a costume or a man
[35:03] for him to dwell
[35:06] in in order for him to be able to have
[35:09] compassion and feel what we
[35:15] feel and so he came through our Lord
[35:17] Jesus
[35:22] Christ and Jesus didn't come as a grown
[35:25] man as the first Adam was
[35:32] he started all the way from the
[35:34] beginning as a little
[35:39] baby and so then
[35:41] God commanded this
[35:45] work to create Jesus being a
[35:50] baby unto Joseph and
[35:56] Mary and I believe Mary and Joseph were
[35:58] very exemplary uh
[36:06] parents because through them Jesus
[36:08] Christ was
[36:12] born and they educated
[36:24] Jesus and so we come to see that in
[36:26] order for us to be adopted we have to be
[36:28] under
[36:32] tutors and we see that the tutors of
[36:35] Jesus were was Mary and
[36:44] Joseph and they only had the
[36:46] responsibility to make sure that Jesus
[36:48] had to learn what he had to
[36:51] learn and I believe that they did a
[36:53] really good
[36:55] job Jesus was born
[36:57] [Music]
[37:02] and when the king wanted to kill him and
[37:04] get rid of
[37:05] him then they left onto Egypt and they
[37:09] returned
[37:15] back and then we don't hear anything
[37:17] about Jesus until after the age of about
[37:19] around 12 years
[37:22] old and we come to see that Jesus was
[37:25] already in his father's business
[37:32] and my question is at the age of 12
[37:33] years old what were we
[37:39] doing and so since he is our example at
[37:42] the age of 12 he was already
[37:47] preaching and we see that he's in the
[37:49] temple and all the priests and uh that
[37:51] were
[37:53] there they were all amazed at the wisdom
[37:57] that this young child
[38:02] had and so when Joseph and Mary went to
[38:04] go seek for
[38:10] Jesus and Jesus replied unto them is do
[38:13] you see not that it's uh that I'm about
[38:15] my father's
[38:19] business so we come to see that God was
[38:22] Jesus's
[38:26] father
[38:28] and we come to see that Mary and Joseph
[38:29] were only his
[38:32] teachers and so his life went out all
[38:34] the way through in
[38:37] this until he came unto a complete
[38:43] maturing and so we see that he had to go
[38:45] through different stages in his
[38:48] life we see that Jesus had to be
[38:53] baptized by his cousin
[38:56] John he was wasn't a child
[39:00] anymore Joseph and Mary went to go look
[39:03] for him at the
[39:10] temple but when Jesus went to go get
[39:12] baptized uh Mary and Joseph were no
[39:15] longer
[39:16] there because he was already at a much
[39:19] mature
[39:21] age and so when he was
[39:24] baptized then there he received the Holy
[39:27] Ghost
[39:35] and we see that the Bible says that the
[39:37] Holy Spirit came down in the form of a
[39:42] dove and we hear a voice uh calling out
[39:45] saying this is my beloved
[39:48] Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell
[39:53] in and so then we see that right then
[39:55] and there he received the Holy Ghost
[39:58] and ever since then he started his
[40:02] ministry and so we find out that Jesus
[40:04] also had to be
[40:07] adopted and if we go back into uh the
[40:10] mount
[40:19] Transfiguration we see then there that's
[40:21] when he was adopted and we're going to
[40:23] read it in Luke chapter
[40:26] 9
[40:33] uh chapter 9 verse
[40:35] 28 and it reads like this and it came to
[40:37] pass at about an eight days after these
[40:44] sayings he took Peter and John and James
[40:47] and went up to the mountain to
[40:50] pray and as you can see here he took
[40:53] three
[40:56] Witnesses
[41:02] and as he prayed uh the fashion of his
[41:04] count uh countenance was altered and his
[41:07] reignment was as white and
[41:14] glistering and behold there talked with
[41:16] him two men which were Moses and
[41:25] Elias and we see here that he had two
[41:27] more witnesses here that were Celestial
[41:29] and are
[41:37] Earthly who appeared in glory and spake
[41:40] of his decease which he should
[41:42] accomplish at
[41:55] Jer but Peter and they that were with
[41:58] him were heavy with sleep and when they
[42:00] were awake they saw his glory and the
[42:03] two men that stood with
[42:26] him yeah and it came to pass as they
[42:29] departed from him Peter said unto Jesus
[42:32] Master it is good for us to be here and
[42:34] let us make three Tabernacles one for
[42:36] thee one for Moses and one for Elias not
[42:39] knowing what he
[42:47] said while he said while he thus spake
[42:50] there came a cloud and overshadowed them
[42:53] and they were feared as they entered
[42:54] into the
[42:56] cloud
[43:03] and there came a voice out of the cloud
[43:05] saying this is my beloved Son hear ye
[43:08] hear ye
[43:12] him Jesus was baptized in the Jordan
[43:15] River by
[43:17] John and there we see that he received
[43:19] the Holy
[43:21] Ghost and yet he was not
[43:26] adopted and then we come to find out
[43:28] over here in this part the same
[43:35] voice when he said that this is my
[43:37] beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell
[43:43] in and then we see in this other verse
[43:45] that it says this is my beloved Son hear
[43:51] him and it was at this point that he was
[43:53] adopted and all authority was handed
[43:55] onto
[43:56] him
[43:58] he was already placed in
[44:02] position and as brother Brandon says as
[44:04] the father adopts the
[44:10] son then now the the voice of the son is
[44:13] just as good as the
[44:21] fathers and all the decisions that the
[44:23] son makes the father is pleased in
[44:25] agreement with him uh for he has been
[44:28] already adopted in
[44:33] place and so for him to be
[44:37] adopted he first had to go through a
[44:42] [Music]
[44:50] process and in the same manner just as
[44:53] us if we want to be
[44:55] adopted then we must this
[45:07] process and so in order to be adopted we
[45:10] first have to have the new
[45:15] birth might be able to say that we're
[45:17] the sons of
[45:23] God but just by saying it does not
[45:25] guarantee that we are
[45:30] because it could just be a mental
[45:34] conception that just because I come to
[45:40] church that does not want to mean or say
[45:46] anything because I believe the Catholics
[45:48] and all different denominations they all
[45:50] go to
[45:52] church but that does not guarantee that
[45:55] we are the children of God
[46:02] we must first be recognized and adopted
[46:06] by the Lord Jesus
[46:12] Christ and so we must go through this
[46:17] process and it's very necessary for us
[46:19] to be born
[46:22] again it is very essential
[46:25] important that we must be born
[46:29] again and if there is no birth then
[46:31] there is no
[46:40] child uh so I'm going to explain the
[46:42] process of how a human being comes under
[46:46] Earth it is the mixing of both masculine
[46:49] and feminine uh
[46:51] genes that
[46:55] unite and and then there is a conception
[46:58] that takes
[47:01] place and we see that that takes into
[47:06] place and it takes form of an embryo
[47:14] thank and we see in the process of after
[47:16] N9
[47:22] months then we see that it begins to uh
[47:26] make its uh
[47:27] process or
[47:31] progress so potentially that will be a
[47:33] child that comes on
[47:36] Earth but you can't call it a a child
[47:38] because it's not born
[47:42] yet and it is a very dangerous process
[47:45] because there could be an
[47:49] abortion and so when you are kind
[47:55] um
[47:57] begotten sorry uh end the
[48:08] gospel then we see that that's sort of
[48:10] the process of the fetus being born
[48:12] inside the the
[48:15] womb and just as as I said there could
[48:18] be an
[48:23] abortion and so then when a mother is
[48:26] pregnated
[48:29] that is a life that is given by
[48:33] God and what must that uh woman
[48:37] do that woman shouldn't do
[48:41] anything but take care of
[48:44] herself and feed herself
[48:50] well so in the same manner when we
[48:53] become begotten into the
[48:55] gospel that we' have accepted this
[49:01] message uh we shouldn't be doing much
[49:04] because uh that's part of the
[49:10] birth we just need to take care of
[49:15] ourselves take care ourselves of the
[49:17] things of the
[49:19] world not participating in the things of
[49:21] the
[49:22] world and feeding yourself off of
[49:25] it or feed yourself with the
[49:31] word and so that we could be fed by the
[49:38] word and it comes point to where that
[49:41] mother has to be
[49:45] born or that mother has to give birth
[49:47] and then in that point then we can say
[49:48] that there has been a
[49:52] birth we can then say that there has
[49:55] been a son now
[50:00] and just because the son was born
[50:01] doesn't mean that the job is completely
[50:04] done now that child has to be has to
[50:07] grow up has to
[50:11] mature and as it
[50:16] grows it begins to experiment a lot of
[50:19] pain a lot of growing
[50:23] pains and as we see that a child has one
[50:25] or two years
[50:30] we call them at those terrible
[50:37] twos because they don't really
[50:39] understand much so then they only go
[50:41] according to what their nature
[50:47] is and that's the reason why the as us
[50:50] as parents must be there to be able to
[50:52] take take care of
[50:54] them because they can't take care of of
[50:58] themselves they're growing
[51:01] up and they have the tendency of making
[51:04] a lot of
[51:09] mistakes and then they they grow up to a
[51:11] part of being a
[51:15] teenager and then those are the most
[51:17] crucial moments that you have to go
[51:24] through because now you've gone into to
[51:26] the transition of being a young man or a
[51:28] young
[51:31] woman so we see that the natural is a
[51:33] type of the
[51:39] spiritual and in the spiritual we see
[51:42] that we see the same process that we
[51:44] must be inher uh inherited
[51:47] with until the
[51:50] adoption if there is a no if there is no
[51:53] New
[51:54] Birth then there is no child
[51:59] and when the child is
[52:01] born the child of
[52:03] God the the process isn't done
[52:07] yet the thing is that they must
[52:11] mature and go through all the
[52:13] processes until the
[52:17] adoption and then in order to be born
[52:21] again and here's the key to it uh we
[52:24] must first die
[52:28] die to
[52:31] ourselves and that's the one thing that
[52:33] humans don't like to
[52:35] do or we don't like to
[52:40] do or the time hasn't arrived for us to
[52:52] die and that's what Jesus told Nicodemus
[52:55] in order to have life you must first be
[52:57] bornn
[52:59] again but in order to be born again you
[53:02] first have to
[53:06] die and that's the problem with us is
[53:09] that we don't want to
[53:11] die we want eternal
[53:13] life but we don't want to pay the
[53:18] price and that is the price that we must
[53:21] pay in order for us to be able to
[53:24] inherit that adoption
[53:32] uh and I see just as David encountered
[53:36] himself with that great Philistine with
[53:41] Goliath and we see that David was a man
[53:43] after man after God's Own
[53:47] Heart and he already defeated a bear and
[53:50] a
[53:52] lion and so his faith was so
[53:55] great
[53:58] that he had already a record or a
[54:00] history of destroying those
[54:06] beasts and so in his mind he thought
[54:09] since I already defeated the The Lion
[54:11] and the
[54:15] bear then surely I could defeat this
[54:18] Goliath who was in front of
[54:25] him
[54:27] and so we see that we don't just have
[54:28] one Goliath but we have many
[54:34] goliaths one of those goliaths is the uh
[54:38] anger or
[54:39] resentment the
[54:41] hate the
[54:43] anger the
[54:45] jealousy the uh
[54:52] bitterness and all those things that are
[54:54] hindering us in our lives
[55:00] and just as the Bible says that
[55:03] uh let us lay aside all uh weight and
[55:09] sin that easily besets us that we may
[55:11] run with patience this race that's set
[55:13] before
[55:15] us the race that's set before
[55:19] us which is the life of a
[55:24] Christian and so then that manner we can
[55:26] serve God even
[55:30] better and so we must come to that
[55:35] adoption in order for us to be
[55:37] manifested sons of
[55:45] God and unfortunately there will be
[55:47] millions of people that will be cast out
[55:49] to the lake of
[55:51] fire but there will also be a lot of
[55:54] people that are
[55:55] saved
[55:57] people that are predestinated to be part
[55:59] of the
[56:02] bride and then there's people that will
[56:04] be predestinated to be a part of the
[56:06] foolish
[56:08] bride and the
[56:14] 144,000 and just as the the thief that
[56:17] was at the cross in his last
[56:22] moments there in his last moments he had
[56:24] his opportunity
[56:26] and he was
[56:31] saved and those that give a go cold
[56:34] glass of water to the
[56:38] bride those people without even knowing
[56:40] they will have eternal
[56:46] life but our goal is to be part of the
[56:51] bride and I believe that that's our goal
[56:53] and everybody or everyone here
[56:58] to not be part of the foolish
[57:03] bride and even brother bam says that
[57:05] being part of a foolish Bride is a great
[57:08] thing because the word
[57:12] virgin is to be chased and
[57:17] clean that doesn't contaminate with the
[57:19] things of this
[57:21] world but from the forn knowledge of
[57:25] God and the election of
[57:28] God the bride is
[57:35] special and brother brandham tells us
[57:37] that the
[57:40] remnant it has that the same
[57:46] material is the same and that same
[57:48] material is has the same
[57:51] color and
[57:54] texture and the same quality
[57:57] is the same
[58:00] material uh but by the election of
[58:04] God he takes that
[58:09] pattern he takes it he draws it out on
[58:12] on that material and he cuts it out for
[58:14] the
[58:17] bride and so the remnant of that piece
[58:19] is now laid
[58:23] aside but God still wants to keep that
[58:26] piece of Remnant that that was taken out
[58:28] of the
[58:32] bride and so being part of the foolish
[58:35] bride is also a big
[58:42] deal and I've heard commentary from
[58:45] other people that end up stating that if
[58:48] they don't make it to be part of the
[58:49] Bride then at least they would like to
[58:50] be part of the
[58:55] foolish
[58:58] uh being part of the foolish B just as I
[59:01] said previously it is almost uh there is
[59:03] still a
[59:06] virgin and so then that's our
[59:10] goal to be uh to be able to accomplish
[59:13] the being part of the
[59:15] Bride although it is part of being the
[59:18] election of
[59:22] God and God wants us to be part of the
[59:25] Bride
[59:27] and in order for that to happen we first
[59:29] have to be born
[59:31] again and so when Jesus Christ came on
[59:34] the
[59:35] earth and ascended
[59:37] up when he came down to earth and
[59:39] ascended
[59:40] up and he sent the Holy
[59:45] Ghost to uh lead us onto all
[59:47] righteousness and
[59:52] Truth uh and the Holy Spirit being a
[59:55] gentleman
[59:58] the Bible states that he who started the
[1:00:00] work is going to finish
[1:00:02] it but that all depends on each and
[1:00:05] every one of
[1:00:09] us because God being a gentleman he will
[1:00:12] never Force us to do something that we
[1:00:13] don't
[1:00:15] want because they come and it falls in
[1:00:18] our lot for us to do
[1:00:22] that now he did his part in Redeeming
[1:00:24] the humanity
[1:00:27] and he paid the price for
[1:00:31] Humanity and now we must pay the price
[1:00:33] in the same
[1:00:35] manner if it is truly that we want to be
[1:00:39] adopted and it's something that we most
[1:00:42] of us don't want to
[1:00:43] pay we want to be part of the
[1:00:46] Bride we want the
[1:00:49] benefits but we don't want to pay the
[1:00:54] price and so so we must first surrender
[1:00:57] ourselves to the
[1:01:00] word to The Obedience of the Holy
[1:01:04] Spirit and to live such a
[1:01:07] life that the people out in the
[1:01:11] world can see the person of Jesus Christ
[1:01:14] in our own lives it's very easy to be
[1:01:16] able to say
[1:01:20] it but it takes something really special
[1:01:23] in order to accomplish
[1:01:24] it
[1:01:29] and especially in these times where it's
[1:01:31] really easy to get
[1:01:34] distracted and now we know that we're
[1:01:36] leaving where we are currently living in
[1:01:38] the end
[1:01:40] time and the devil as rowing
[1:01:44] lion he's seeking who he may
[1:01:48] devour and if we're not
[1:01:52] ready that storm is going to take
[1:01:54] us the uh the storm of the
[1:02:00] world now this is an individual
[1:02:05] walk it is not a group effort like the
[1:02:08] uh the people of
[1:02:12] Israel but then once you fulfill your
[1:02:16] part then you must give account unto
[1:02:21] God and then it it's no longer under the
[1:02:24] responsibilities of the parents
[1:02:30] now it's no longer under the mercy of
[1:02:32] the
[1:02:36] blood now it's under your own
[1:02:40] conscience and so then when a young man
[1:02:43] or young woman comes up to that
[1:02:48] age then they must take their own
[1:02:50] decision of giving their lives unto
[1:02:54] God
[1:02:56] and then we must have in in our minds
[1:02:58] that this is an individual
[1:03:02] walk and in that day the husband won't
[1:03:04] be
[1:03:06] there the wife or the pastor won't be
[1:03:10] there the deacons or the
[1:03:15] elders it would only be you and God on
[1:03:19] that
[1:03:23] day and so it falls on all of our lots
[1:03:26] that one day we're going to come down to
[1:03:30] earth and we have a certain amount of
[1:03:32] time before we have to leave this earth
[1:03:34] it's only a
[1:03:37] breath a breath away and then we're
[1:03:39] going to find ourselves with the reality
[1:03:41] of
[1:03:43] things this is only but just a
[1:03:48] foreshadow in reality of what is to
[1:03:53] come and it would be a sad thing that
[1:03:55] after knowing this
[1:03:58] message that we have failed the
[1:04:01] target so as long as there's life
[1:04:04] there's still
[1:04:06] hope and we have to
[1:04:09] battle if we wish to reign with
[1:04:12] him let us stand so we can go into
[1:04:16] prayer if the musicians can come
[1:04:22] up let us bow our
[1:04:24] heads
[1:04:26] Heavenly
[1:04:28] Father we ask for
[1:04:33] Mercy the judgments are quickly
[1:04:37] arriving and we ask you once again just
[1:04:40] as Samson did that you help
[1:04:44] us that we may make an inventory of our
[1:04:48] lives and that we may correct our
[1:04:52] lives and that we may surrender to your
[1:04:54] word
[1:04:57] and leave the things of this
[1:05:01] world and that we may stop flirting with
[1:05:04] the
[1:05:06] world and die to
[1:05:09] ourselves we thank you for your
[1:05:14] word thank you for this precious message
[1:05:16] that you sent
[1:05:21] us and father we couldn't find ourselves
[1:05:23] with anything better than this
[1:05:27] permit us father to embrace
[1:05:29] it and every day we live
[1:05:32] it and put it into our
[1:05:37] lives and that we may not just be
[1:05:39] hearers of this
[1:05:41] word may we be doers of this
[1:05:44] word because uh Works without
[1:05:48] faith is a dead
[1:05:53] faith and a dead faith is worth for
[1:05:55] nothing
[1:05:57] if I say that I
[1:05:59] believe and I put uh and I don't put to
[1:06:02] work your
[1:06:04] word then I come to be a
[1:06:09] liar permit Lord that every it might
[1:06:13] being be surrendered unto
[1:06:16] you help us as a church as a
[1:06:19] [Music]
[1:06:21] group as brothers and sisters to take
[1:06:23] care of each other
[1:06:26] to love one
[1:06:28] another and respect one
[1:06:31] another to respect the
[1:06:36] elders the pastor the deacons the
[1:06:40] ushers and most of all to respect one
[1:06:45] another this walk isn't easy
[1:06:47] [Music]
[1:06:49] Lord but greater is he that is in us
[1:06:52] than he that is in the
[1:06:54] world permit us father to cry
[1:06:57] [Music]
[1:06:58] out and give us the strength to continue
[1:07:02] on and we ask you all these
[1:07:05] things in that name that's above all
[1:07:09] names in the name of our Lord Savior
[1:07:11] Jesus Christ amen
[1:07:13] [Music]
