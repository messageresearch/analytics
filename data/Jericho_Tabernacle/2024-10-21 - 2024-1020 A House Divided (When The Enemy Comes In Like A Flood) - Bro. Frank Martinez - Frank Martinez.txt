with you for OPP [Music] for having the confidence us always believe one thing that we always everything we be to people am only amen that's why we're here this morning because after all Brothers we're only here for a short time amen amen and we ask God that everything that is said would benefit somebody that when you leave you can truly say I was glad to be in the house of God would that be all right amen amen so this morning I'd like to speak to you from my heart I've been asking God to help me and a few weeks ago the Lord laid these thoughts in my heart and you know we have the greatest message there ever was [Music] and if you let this message work in your life it will transform you it's the same power that was spoken by almighty God from the very beginning and if that power of God was able to create worlds create this world that you're standing on [Music] what will that power do to me and you think about these things this morning I believe we're living in one of the greatest times that there is these are the closing moments you know what but I believe God left the best for last Brothers he he could have appointed you at another [Music] age amen you know we hear a great men in other ages amen but you know as I said God Save The Best For Last thank you Jesus you just have to identify yourself and always believe that God makes no mistake amen we may see a mistake but God didn't make a mistake he chose you to be in this age the most deceitful age but he knew you would not be deceived amen so we thank God this morning Brothers I feel like preaching and I ain't even read the word you say brother Frank that's the way you are no that's the atmosphere you've already amen amen you know you get into a place where they're playing and singing and you know all this kind of worldly music Brothers if there's worldly music playing Brothers you're not even in the door and you're already Clapping Your Hands you grab your partner and start dancing why because the atmosphere has flown Beyond the Doors and it's caught you and that's the key we need to create an atmosphere where God can come and speak to our hearts we believe he will tonight this morning amen so God bless you once again amen amen if we could go to the scriptures we want to go to Isaiah chapter 59 I remember the words of our Prophet the greatest a there Rivers is one of the most glorious ages but also one of the most deceitful ages amen amen so in isah 59 verse 19 so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the Sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him amen amen let us pray almighty God we are so thankful that you permitted us to be here in the house of God lord and we know that way before time you had an appointed time every person every thought every scripture every quote father you set it aside for this moment what confidence we have in a god like you this morning you that know all things now Lord we come before you we've done all that we've could to prepare we've turned the pages of this Bible but now it's going to take you to come and reveal these things to us Lord we we've prayed Lord we've searched the scriptures and father this morning we pray that you would take every thought that needs to be said and place it in the minds of your vessels Lord father we ask this morning that you would bless your people with a double portion Lord we've come here not just to ask for a little but we come with our arms Open Lord we want to leave with a great blessing in our hearts this morning so father come and speak to us Lord now take control of this service take control of your unworthy servant Lord our interpreter and Lord anoint thy people for you said that the anointing would teach us you also said there would going to come a day where your children would be taught of God we believe it's this day Lord so father we commit ourselves to you now in the name of Jesus Christ forgive every sin for we ask these things in the precious name of thy beloved Son amen amen and amen amen God bless you you may be seated amen amen so this morning also in the Book of Matthew I'd like to read a a scripture there and Jesus said and Jesus knew their thoughts and said unto them every Kingdom divided against itself is brought to Desolation and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand as a title this morning I would like to speak on a House Divided and and and as a as a topic I would like to speak on when the enemy comes in like the flood you know Jesus said over in Matthew 10 that a Man's enemies would be from his household and we want to take some thoughts this morning because we believe that we are up against the greatest enemy That Ever Walked on this Earth but you know even though many times things seem to to come against us and no matter what the devil will send we have a promise that when the enemy comes in like a flood God will lift up a standard against him I believe that we are living in an age where the enemy has come in like a flood now I want to just set here a little foundation so that you can kind of understand what we're going to speak here this morning now Jesus tells us here in verse 25 of Matthew 12 he says every city or House Divided now Jesus never said a divided house but he says A House Divided now and you may wonder and say brother Frank doesn't it mean the same in many instances it does mean the same A House Divided or a divided house but a divided house is a house that wants to go into two directions basically that's what it means it's a divided house but A House Divided it speaks of something more critical than just an opinion it speaks of something more than just which way do I go one of the greatest presidents when Abraham Lincoln took office Abol in his speech Abraham Lincoln took this scripture Abraham Lincoln here in Matthew 12 and as he was was given his speech understand a little bit of background he had come into a country that was divided and he used this scripture and the title of his message was A House Divided because he was coming into a country that was going to be pulled apart if something wasn't done amen at that time the country was divided because of slavery and it was pulling the country apart Brothers think about what's happening this morning we have a house divided may God raise up men like Abraham Lincoln abrah lincol that'll stand up and call what truth is truth and Abraham Lincoln said we have a house divided Abraham lincol and what what did it take to unite this country back together was a civil war amen amen and brothers and sisters I hope that I don't hurt any feelings I'm not here to hurt feelings but I'd Rather somebody tell me the truth now I'd Rather somebody take the Bible and and explain it to me than before it's too late now Brothers we understand that this morning I believe the scripture in Isaiah it fits perfect for this morning I believe the enemy has come in like a flood and a flood is not just something that's directed just to a person but a natural flood has no respect it'll try to destroy everything in its path and that is what the enemy is trying to do he's trying to destroy everything in its path well it might sound horrible but remember amen that God said that when he comes in like a flood I'm going to lift up a standard amen and we're here Brothers to be part of that standard and to lift it up against all those things that are coming amen I believe this morning Brothers you know I'm not saying that I'm a religious person or anything but I know when God has sent me with a message that one thing I am sure amen and that's the kind of people we want not just me Brothers but brothers that will stand up and lift up a standard that's the promise of this hour to stand with the word of God for this hour now notice so we understand what is a standard just so that we can get right into this message what is a standard something that identifies you it's a principle now Brothers this morning I asked God I want to speak the truth I want this message to be real I want to be able to grab it from here and say this is the truth I don't want to make up stuff I want to be able to say see this is what happened Brothers what is a standard many of us still remember back in 911 how many remember you even remember where you were before 911 brother this country hated itself the whites against the colorss all kind of prejudism running everywhere is that right this country was separated but as soon as 911 occurred we forgot about our prejudism the enemy came in and what did we do we rallied around amen the flag of America everybody was waving a flag the cars were waving flags people had Flags in their home because the enemy came and America lifted up a standard and everybody came and United together and that's the way it is the enemy's coming in like a flood and God is lifting up a stand and that is his word that takes all of us to unite around the word of God amen amen if we can do it in the natural how much more in the spiritual amen is that the truth we forgot about all our differences we only had one objective to stand shoulder to shoulder to stand hand in hand and to pray for the country that we never prayed for but it took the enemy to come and do all this damage for us to wake up and realize my fight is not against my fellow citizen an enemy came in Brothers in this message in this message that is not happening we're like post 911 amen but he's coming in like a flood he's coming in like a flood and and he's lift up a standard and we all have to Rally around the message of this hour amen well your brother that believes different from you is not your enemy your enemy that's not your enemy that's your enemy that's your enemy but that's what's happened and this happened in America where you can see it it should happen amongst us too where you're not looking at me and I'm not looking at you but we can stand shoulder to shoulder hand in hand and pray and pray and stand up against this flood that the enem is bring now remember amen amen Jesus said A House Divided because he knew it was something more different it was something more serious something that would cause the house to fall not just different opinions on where to go but something that was causing the church to fracture remember these have to be facts I'm not willing to stand up here and pull a rabbit out of my my hat or my sleeve these things have to be facts amen amen it has to be I will show you in just a little bit it's got to be greater than facts it's got to be truth right amen now I'm just so that you know what kind of enemy Brothers brother BR do you still believe what brother brandham said brother brandom said that the enemy was defeated the enemy Was Defeated then if he's defeated who's defeating us we're always blaming him you can't blame him if he's Defeated come on Brothers we're always blaming the devil but you know the Devil he's Sly he's deceitful he wants to keep you from looking at the truth he wants you to think think that he's the greatest enemy he's not the greatest enemy we're the greatest enemy is that right because he's defeated we're not defeated he's defeated but you got to look in the mirror and say I am my greatest enemy once you can overcome him he's defeated now watch this brother brandom said on the message Israel and the church part one he says watch it's moving out today in a terrible Force a few verses before this brother brandom takes us way back to the times of Cain and then he brings it to our day and he says notice how all those great religious men that existed at that time we had great teachers and Pharisees Grand we had priests Grandes amen amen that that knew the scriptures but when the word was made flesh they didn't recognize it listen when the word was made flesh they didn't recognize it and that's what the enemy wants us to think Brothers I believe God sent a prophet I believe that but I believe that when he stood in the Pulpit I believe that when he was praying for the sick that was no longer a man that was God in a man amen am that was God in a man I believe with all my heart I was telling my brother just a few minutes ago I was we were hearing a message and this brother comes up to brother brandham prior to that he had seen brother brandham Discerning the thoughts of the people the man steps up to brother brandham brother Bram says brother God bless you you're healed and the brother walks off and the brother had already walked not out not off the platform but he was on his way off the platform when the angel of the Lord told Brother Bram call him back in his heart he's questioning why you didn't discern his sickness and brother brandom said brother come back in your heart you're asking God why did he not discern my sickness so now in the name of the Lord you got heart trouble go home and be well who was that that was God [Applause] now notice so brother brandom says it's all right if I take off my coat amen now notice this so brother brandom says he says they could not recognize when Jesus came on the earth and brothers that is the same thing that is happening now amen amen all these great scholars in the message all these people that once used to sit in the message service you know what they've done they've taken the place of those scribes and Pharisees and now after seeing Miracle after Miracle by this prophet they can't recognize it they refuse to recognize it that's the same thing that they did back then and here's where I want to quote you something that brother brandham said that this is moving today in a terrible Force we're trying to discredit the ministry of our Prophet but watch what brother brandham said he says oh it behooves you my brother and sister to consider what you're listening at amen amen and don't ever underestimate I'm going to say it again don't ever underestimate the power Satan's power for deceiving don't you never underestimate him he's as smooth as can be it got my attention where the prophet of God said consider to what you're listening it's like if he already knew that the greatest danger in this age is social media amen social media has comeing like a flood is that right and brother brandom said you need to consider what you're listening and don't ever underestimate the Devil he's deceitful brother random said if he doesn't get you one way he'll get you another way he's become our greatest enemy not because he has power because he's deceitful he's deceitful brother brandom came to a point where he said the enemy will tell you that you got the Holy Ghost when you ain't God is that right could you imagine you got the Holy Ghost and you believe it and you ain't got it but then he also said he'll tell you you ain't got it when you do have it and what happens we're always complaining God I'm not your child why don't you give me the Holy Ghost you already got it he just told you you ain't got it that's right that's how deceitful he is and don't tell me those things don't come through our minds don't never underestimate him Brothers we preach we have revivals we preach we got ministers and we preach and we preach and we preach and the enemy is still deceiving us that didn't hurt did it is it true is it true these pulpits are never empty the people are always rejoicing then why is he still defeating us could it could it be that we don't know where he's at and the only way to know where he's at go back how he started and follow him once we know where he's at said devil you ain't going to do that to me no more but we got to know where he's at amen and and and sometimes when we uncover where it's at we don't want it we don't want to accept it it can't it can't be because I pay my tithing it can't be because I preach it can't be because I sing it can't be because I'm a member of the church brother random said we're dying in our church pews amen we're dying we're dying in our church PE amen oh we got great teachings amen we got great teachings what we need is an experience with God that's what we need we need an experience with God God Amen we need more praying more seeking after God that's what we need notice here so remember brother Ram said that he's moving in a terrible Force amen amen that's the flood amen amen that that that the en has come in like a flood he doesn't want to spare anything now I better hurry I'll keep you here to 1:00 Brothers amen Brothers I'm in love with this amen I don't know if I said it here before but when I was dating my wife she she'd have to tell me go home Frank I don't want to go home I was in love and I'm in love now why should I want to go [Applause] [Music] home now watch this on Israel in the church part three paragraph 49 now brother brandom or or or Jesus is quoting Matthew 12:25 A House Divided brother raham says in paragraph 49 Jesus said if a house be divided against itself now watch this if Satan cast out Satan then his kingdom is divided then brother brandom uses the word the same word don't you underestimate the devil that's right he's too smart for that Satan ain't going to cast himself out he's got you confused that's all no sir Satan can't cast out Satan now brother brandom says he puts himself as Satan talking me cast myself out why I know better than that we could learn something Satan understands that he can't come against his own kingdom but we haven't understood that yet Satan knew that if he comes against his own kingdom it would be destroyed he had Revelation where's ours this morning this morning brothers and sisters he knows what we should know be knowing this morning amen amen remember he's deceitful amen he's not going to do this to himself but he doesn't mind if we do that to each other that's right brother that's right is that all right amen amen now watch this so brother brandham takes takes like a little saying you know like like sometimes when the brothers get together and say and uh there's a saying is that right and we've all got sayings especially if you get older amen I hope this this don't sound bad but but my mama used to say that's right is that right my mama my mama used to say that but that was a say amen amen you know what that means brothers and sisters oh brother random had a saying on the message show us the father and it'll satisfy paragraph 62 brother brandom said this now pay attention watch this he says it ain't the robin that pecks on the Apple that hurts it it's the worm at the core did you hear that Brothers it's not the bird that's pecking at the Apple on the outside it's the worm that's on the core of the Apple the problem is not coming from the outside the problem is on the inside and that's the way Satan has always covered himself because he's pecking on the outside amen getting you to see something else while he is working on the inside can I read it again it ain't the robin that picks on the Apple that hurts it it's the worm at the core that's exactly right that's what that's the other side these preachers will tell you about brothers and sisters brother Brom said there's ministers that will tell you yeah it's the Robin That's picking the Apple that's your problem and then there's ministers that will tell you don't pay attention to that bird your bird your your problem your problem is on the inside there's preachers that will tell you the other side Brothers it's not the visible things the things that are obvious and those are the things that we're always pointing to no this this morning no no let's not hear the of the Apple let's go down inside the very core amen once we can get the problem that's inside that's rooted inside once we can get that out the rest of it will be all right amen amen now watch here and brother Ram said what what you need today is a good oldfashioned house cleaning in the church amen a good house cleaning oh don't do it like I do when my wife says vacuum the house all right I'll vacuum the house 5 minutes and I'm done and then she gets the broom look at all this hair because she goes behind the washing machine is that right and then I go did I miss all that is that true did I miss all that brothers and sisters and I'm here to tell you this morning we need to go way down deep and find out what's causing this because the I'm want to prove to you that brother brandom said that the devil has had a marvelous success brothers and sisters amen amen none of us want to go deep none of us W to W to want to expose I'll be the first one to tell you I don't like doctors amen I don't like shots amen if I'm going to go to the doctor and he says take this pill that's a good doctor I'm leaving but that's not a good doctor that's not a good doctor Amen brother brandom said if if you go to a doctor and you've got a pain somewhere and the doctor says well let me see you all right take this peel and go home brother random said he's not a good doctor but hear me out but a good doctor will examine you and he say all right you've got to come back for a complete physical examination raise your hands if you like a physical examination to the doctor I don't like to go to a complete physical you know why cuz I'm going to be exposed is that right we're going to be exposed he's going to check everything is that all right to say he's going to check everything because that's a good doctor he wants to make sure that this is all right that this is all right and then he'll tell you what the problem but this isn't going to happen with just a pill this morning we need to be exposed we need to say God come into the very depths of my [Music] soul amen come inside the very deeps of my thinking better yet check out what my in itions are we need a complete physical this morning not just some pill we can go happy rejoicing but we need a great physician to give us a complete physical M our bodies our souls would that be all right because you can see up to now the problem is not on the outside the problem is on the inside up to now you can see this now I want to go to a scripture in Job chapter 1 in verse six now notice I'm keeping my eye on the clock I'm looking up there every 20 minutes see I do it I do it in in 20 minute sections amen amen so if it's 20 minutes and it goes up it's every 20 minutes Brothers now watch this now in Job chapter 1 in verse 6 you're familiar with this now there was a day when the sons of who of God the sons of God you know brother brandom said we were there we were there amen now notice watch here oh Brothers you could preach something on that watch there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord but they weren't alone and Satan came also among them he came also among them verse seven and the Lord said unto to Satan see because when the Book of Job was written because brother brandham says that the Book of Job is the oldest book in the Bible is that right amen amen at this moment at this point in time job was still in speaking terms with God amen amen he he was among the sons of God at this point he wasn't he wasn't all prideful yet amen amen and the Bible says and the Lord said unto Satan when comest thou then Satan answered the Lord and said from going to and fro in the Earth from walking up and down in it can can we say something here he's still doing the the same thing I believe it's in the message contest brother brandom says not only are you studying Satan but Satan is studying you amen amen not only are you studying him he he's also analyzing you we think that this is all one way no sir he's also he gots his on you amen so so if we go back to job one we see here that the sons of God came and presented themselves before the Lord and Satan was there with them now I don't think that anywhere Satan is is a good thing Satan never comes with good intentions he might show you something beautiful but it isn't that he wants you to get something beautiful he wants to deceive you anything that Satan gives you it's for his own gain how many is following me so we understand here that he came amongst the sons of God and even presented himself before the Lord but something happened between the first chapter of job and Revelations 12 something happened and in order for us to find find out we've got to go to the message in Revelations 12 and verse 3 in job one he's amongst the sons of God and in the presence of God but between Job 1 and Revelations 12 something happened something happened and he turned turned against God but how did he turn against God the Bible tells us and there appeared verse three and there appeared another Wonder in heaven and and and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and 10 horns and seven crowns upon his head and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered and to devour her child as soon as it was born now I I want you to see this that brother brandom tells us and I know you've read it in the message especially you ministers brother brandom said the the the the the dragon didn't it's not a pale like a horse tail it's not like an animal tail it's not a a tail like you see you know on the chili it's got a hook it's not that kind of ta no Brothers It's the tale the fairy tale the story that he told it's the tale that he told in other words and here again is why you need to go to the message to truly understand the scripture now notice on the message the God of this evil age brother Bram said it was Satan's ambition it was his ambition you know what the word ambition means it means a desire to achieve something Brothers the only ambition that we should have is the Vision that God gives us not to be great amongst ourselves not to be the biggest church or the biggest preachers that doesn't come from God that comes from Satan amen amen I'm going to be the best one I'm going to be the best one and I'm going to no brothers that does not come from God Amen what what what is our subject when the enemy comes in like a flood God will lift up a standard and God's standard is his word is the revealed message of this hour now watch here so brother Bram says it was Satan's ambition to be worshiped like God and he took two3 two third of the Stars not onethird the Bible says onethird prophet of God said two3 brothers and sisters it was the little church it was the one-third that wasn't deceived it was the two3 remember the old saying not because everybody does it doesn't mean it's right amen amen so watch here so he took two3 two3 of the stars of Heaven ascended himself above those stars and he preached to them Satan preached to them brothers let me tell you something this was a preacher this was a preacher he was able to deceive two3 of God's kingdom don't tell me he didn't know how to preach he was anointed to preach can you imagine what he was preaching amen amen he was preaching something that convinced the greater majority of Heaven to to go with him amen amen two3 and what happened he divided the kingdom amen amen I want to say something don't want to get off to preaching but I want say something that one third that didn't listen to the devil amen amen they stood on Michael's [Applause] side they stood on Michael's side Brothers we know who Michael is we know who Michael is they stay on his side amen and what happened the enemy got whole congregation he got all the sons of God and he came and he got behind the pulpit he started to preach oh it was so anointing amen oh Lucifer was going he was anointed oh they were just worshiping and they were just just having a good old time by the end of the service he had already or or deceived the majority of the church and what happened what happened he got them to attack each other that's the Bible it wasn't the bird that was pecking Satan knew that if he got on the end into the very core of the church and convince them brothers they would be at each other where does all this come from just so that we understand that all this has scriptural history amen all this has scriptural history Brothers where did Moses greatest headaches come from and do you know Kora was a was a relative to Moses he was a relative to Moses and if you can't trust your relatives who you going to trust if you can't trust your brothers who you going to trust if you can't trust people in this message who you going to trusten brothers and who was Jesus greatest obstacle it was from his church it was Judas Judas turned him in amen amen and brothers brothers and who's become the message's greatest enemies we have amen am those people on social media that were in this message now have turned against this message turned against this the prophet when the enemy comes in like a flock God is going to lift up a stand and I believe that's what he's doing this morning bringing us back to the standard of his word that's what we need Brothers to realize that we are the problems amen amen quit quit looking at the Robin quit looking at the bird picking at the app Brothers it's already amongst us we just need to identify him how he works on the message sayen brother you just raise your hand when I'm out of when I'm out of time I don't know maybe brother Santana can go out there I won't look that way I'll look over there you just tell me when I'm out of time brother if you if you don't stop me I'm going to continue going [Music] amen no I respect this church and I love you more than you what you think amen amen now watch this in paragraph 65 the message sat e uh Eden preached 1965 brother Bram said now I'm I want to move pretty fast he said he said he would exalt himself above the most high he would Ascend above the clouds and the stars and he would sit there like God and be above the most high and he succeeded in carrying out his threats he certainly has he's had a marvelous success in carry carrying out his threats I am not giving him credit the prophet of God he has had a marvelous success so now you understand brothers that this enemy is deceitful it's not because he has power it's because he has the power to deceive amen amen now watch here somebody might be saying well I don't like what brother Frank he's too preachy no brothers I'm I'm not to preach he we need to speak the truth and as long as it's coming out of the message we we need to hear it so brother brandom said he's got a marvelous success let's let's carry that for in our minds for just a bit by people explaining him away in every age the value of God's promised word of that age isn't that what's happening amen amen all the these men they try so hard to explain that everything brother brandom said or done was wrong they'll tell you that the cloud was not Supernatural that it was a missile and they go on and on and on and on trying to discredit the messenger or the message amen amen but remember in the face of all this there's still a third a third of Heaven that stayed true to the word I want to be part of that third I want to stand with Michael I want to stand with this Prophet amen because I was there I was there when Satan was preaching I said devil you [Music] and you know what he said you got to make your choice I made my choice a long time ago amen brothers and sisters brother let me say this I know here another 17 days oh Brothers Oh everybody's is it going to be a woman president oh is it going to be a man president everybody say go you didn't like Trump go Trump go Trump go Trump trump Trump trump why do you want Trump to win cuz you want to stay here longer amen amen Brothers as I told the church the other day I'm not worried about who's in the white church in the white house I'm worried about who's in this house is that right not worried about brothers because if he's not in this house whatever happens in the White House don't pertain to me amen but if he's in this house it don't matter who's at the White House I know that surely will be leaving [Applause] now watch so brother brandom said that he explained in every age he explained the promised word away that's exactly what he's done in every age he's explained it away you got to be very careful of what you hear amen am he'll try to explain these things away and in paragraph 66 of the same message brother brandom says he talks about I'm just going to paraphrase it right quick in the days of Noah he tried to explain that it was impossible for it to rain hey man he said they would shoot instruments up into heaven remember and brother brandom says scientifically they could prove that there was no rain up there amen amen he says and Satan succeeded in poisoning the minds of the people you hear that YouTube garbage so much that you're going to start believing it amen you know why I'm GNA tell you something I'm GNA tell you something people say well you know the Devil he's a father of Li oh yeah he don't lie to you when it's obvious he never gives you up obvious lie brother brandom said the greatest lie that was ever told had 99.9% of the truth in it it's never going to be obvious it's never going to be obvious do you know that Satan uses facts you know he uses facts Brothers he's not he listen to me I'm not giving the devil any credit and you have to understand that I'm not on his side I'm just trying to tell you what kind of enemy he is amen amen Brothers but Satan will show you the facts when Abraham was going to have a baby Abraham said Satan said you can't have no babies you're too old that's a fact you said he was lying he wasn't lying Abraham was was too old he could have told abrah go go down there get a check up and take and take your wife and see what they tell you that that's why he could stand there and boast cuz he was he those Li they were facts they were facts amen am brothers let's bring that a little bit closer the the devil will tell you are you sick you go no yeah you are you feel that pain he he's not lying to you we think that when the devil lies he's going to come over with something no no no fairy tales he'll tell you sister your husband don't love you yes he does no no no he was cheating on you no no no was that a lie no that's the truth is that right it's nothing but the facts where did you get this idea that he's the kind of liar that we always think that he is no I'm not saying he can do whatever he wants to but in the Bible that he told the people it was the truth amen amen glory to God thank you Lord those are facts amen amen he said your kids are lost oh no they're not they're lost when he comes here smell his breath he's GNA smell like cigarettes he's gonna smell like beer come on Brothers is that the truth he tells you the facts he tells you the facts amen amen but remember one thing the truth to us the truth to us is not a declaration of right and wrong the truth to us is the person of Jesus Christ amen amen and whatever he says is greater than the facts that we see amen that is why you've got to take God in his word truth to us is not what's right and what's wrong to us is a person and when that person becomes the truth and you see that the devil tells you you're sick the truth the person of Christ it supersedes your facts is that right is that right it supersedes the facts amen amen I I was given the sign the brother said halftime is that halftime brother the brother went like that I thought that was halftime no with me brother you got to go like this amen amen so when that I'm going to start closing so when that becomes when that truth becomes part of us then that truth is greater than any fact any any symptom that we see now I want to close with this I did a little study in back in the 1940s when when God made this body he made this body perfect during the fall we know that different diseases and sickness Came Upon This body and brother Bram said he says doctors cannot heal the body they just assist the body but the body is so it's a marvelous work of God that you can cut your finger and in a week or so you can't even tell there was anything there God made the body to heal itself it made the body to heal itself amen amen and not only that this body and I just got to paraphrase it because I I spent another half hour on this but this body God gave it cells and it gave the body intelligence that when a cancer comes from the outside remember that bird knocking amen amen there's a defense that fights against all those diseases amen it fights against all those diseases and not only that I was reading an article that one of the doctors said the body will actually take a picture of something that's trying to invade it if it gets in and when it gets in they all attack it to get it out to get it out amen amen but back in 1940 there was a doctor that said something strange is happening to the body and as medicine improved and there was more knowledge in 1960 the scientists and the doctors realized that there was something called an autoimmune disease that the body was actually attacking itself the body was attacking itself the good cells could not discern right from wrong and they were attacking the good cells they were attacking each other and the body now was sick how can the people how can the people ever be victorious if we're going to keep attacking ourselves in this message amen amen but the body would heal itself does not the scripture say by his stripes we were healed amen amen these signs shall follow them that believe the body should have healing in itself when somebody is sick call the Elders anoint them pray for the sick that's the way God made the body but when these autoimmune diseases came into the body and the body started attacking itself the body became weak the body became weak for the body is weak in many sleep that what PA says because we don't discern the body of the Lord the discernment is lost and the same thing that happens to the physical body happens to the spiritual body let can you imagine how awful that my body attacks itself my body can't heal itself the way God made it brothers and sisters but remember brother brandham said why is my daughter not healed there's bomb in Gilead there's a great physician here there's a guaranteed cure there's a guaranteed cure that's the Holy Ghost that's a guaranteed cure it's not just a cure it's guaranteed brothers and sisters when the enemy comes in like a flly God will live up a stand and I believe God has given us his word so that we know it's not the bird that's picking on the Apple it's the worm at the core of the Apple amen brothers and sisters amen it's just too bad that we didn't have time to finish it all but you but you understood let's not look too far let's look right here let's look right here amen amen let's look right here this morning amen am amen amen you know I feel like you're my wife it's time to go brother but you know you've set such a great atmosphere this morning that I could say talking to you all morning and that's because it's the love of God God bless you stand with me this morning let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you this morning for this opportunity that you've given us Lord and we pray Lord that you would help us Lord we know that the enemy in this age like no other age has come in like a flood oh this deceit is everywhere father he truly has come in like a flood but I believe this morning that you fulfilled your word you have lifted up a standard to show to show that you didn't call us you didn't call us you didn't call the body to attack itself and that's what they're doing through social media attacking this message they're attacking our Prophet but father we are those that stayed on Michael side and we are going to continue to proclaim the message of this hour you are a good God we are your children and even though we stand as a minority father you said that the glory of the latter house would be greater than the former house I believe that you saved the best for last and
