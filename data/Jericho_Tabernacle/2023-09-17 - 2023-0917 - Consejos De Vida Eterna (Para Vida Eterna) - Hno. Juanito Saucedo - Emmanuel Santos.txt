it doesn't even it doesn't make any cries or any noise the doctors will spank him a little bit so that he can cry father this morning we thank you for the life that you've given us and you keep giving us gracias we thank you for everything bless everyone here this morning share your word to every one of us that are here this morning may we say something that can help everyone to the new people and to people that have been here for 20 30 years in this beautiful and glorious message Lord we thank you this morning in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen just as you are standing we'll be reading a scripture [Music] as everyone knows me and the clock don't get along at all I want to start immediately and pray to the Lord that he helps us that way we can say something that what can help us there's a scripture that I want to read in Isaiah chapter 9 verse 6. yes the book of Isaiah chapter nine boys and I'll start with verse six Gloria Senor and praise the Lord become a habit in our homes before I go to work at 11 or 12 o'clock at night or one in the morning I read 10 verses of one of the books of the Bible and sometimes I get up so late I'm running all over but I sit down and grab the Bible read 10 verses of the book of the Bible may God help us I know that we're in an age where we run so much and we don't progress that much nacido foreign and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be caught wonderful and counselor and that's where I'll get my title from counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace Brothers this is the main scripture that I want to use and pleaded to the Lord that he has the entire power to cast me to the side may he take the control this morning Sierra a simple spare tire because when we're in a car by God's grace I tell my wife we're gonna put new tires on the [Applause] cars because I drive 10 hours on a daily basis on the streets and there is not a day go by that I don't see a new car or an old Cara that's on the side of the road with the flat tire Hermano siendes and with the 110 degree weather on the outside without a bottle of water what's the first thing that comes to mind when that you see that maybe it's happened to some of you it's happened to myself that's why I tried to put in new tires on my car when I whenever I had the chance I stopped and I offered them a bottle of water and I have with me two gallons of water in my truck yes and sometimes I offer them my two gallons of water and on Friday something happened to my daughter I was on my way home already yeah my wife called me it says your daughter strand ended with the car the air stopped it doesn't want to go anywhere I went over there immediately I thought I'm sure that the radiator doesn't have any water I went over there my daughter was in the car mirror I could see the car and it was already cold it had no water whatsoever agua I just filled it with water I ran here and ran there I sent her to go buy some antifreeze but when she came back I already filled the car with water and I said just uh sweetie turn it on she turned it on I turned on the air yeah and we started running and she left that if we check on them we can avoid a big headache so this morning my thoughts my little subject it's called consejos Council a Para everything that the preacher gives us on Wednesday Friday and Sunday are our councils of eternal life and those is so everything that is preached everything that the prophet taught us everything that the apostles preached is for eternal life for eternal life Council for eternal life is eternal life and then parentheses for eternal life so let's emphasize on the word the word for it encloses or involves certain things and I'll say it right away because time is running up from me that's if we do them that's why I call the councils of eternal life because all councils for children the message is if we read them and if we do them the messages but if we don't do it what's the point we already know what happened in Libya people sleeping in their homes how many were ready how many were ready but that already happened about a week ago so my question for you today is are you ready it's a glory to his name we're going to bring it closer we're going to bring it to ourselves for us that are here gathering for us that have come to hear the council because when the minister is preaching you don't have to be worried about anything you cured spots but if you come be a scooter and you hear but then you don't do it if we do it it's Council of eternal life and in parenthesis foreign regardless of whatever your age is I'm a person that has a lot of age now I I don't look like it but I am yeah I'm up there in age I won't say how much because many of you already know how much but how many of you in the age that you have now you can remember of some advice that your father had given you okay or that your mother gave you concept he three times mentions the word counsel VES how do you think I felt when I was sitting down there because that's what the Lord was giving me because that's what I Was preparing for today so me sitting down there how do you think I fell applications as I heard the testimony where's the brother where is he Hermano trespasses three times that filled me with so much happiness and then brother Emmanuel comes he reads Hebrews she's having around us a great cloud of witnesses let us run this page let us run with patience the race said before us and I liked what he told us when there's a race when there's a relay race and they're ready see that I'm going back and forth because I'm fighting for that race I love it I cherish it for years I've lived in that race it I don't want to be eliminated when I can see the finish line so close up ahead and I said if you fog then get up help him to get up again that's why we're here we're brothers in Christ let us pick each other up then yeah we have very little left but he found us in due time the brother said when he came up here and read it he says there's a petition that our brother has been waiting for 28 years Council of eternal life that's if we do it now let me give you this scripture and it took me about two hours to find it I have brother Octavius phone number I have your phone number I could have called you or with you I have brother oh videos phone number too I have many of yours uh phone numbers I said no I have to find it on my own I know it's a scripture that's in the word it's in the New Testament it's in the Epistles on Saturday I got up at five in the morning it took me two hours just to find this scripture I didn't want to go to use my phone neither did I want to go to the Internet neither did I want to use the Scofield concordance that the Bible has I said no I have to find it I have the feeling in my heart that I'm going to read it I said Lord help my mind and I'll guide my fingers and twice I went over this book of First Corinthians and you can join me in First Corinthians I passed over 100 or twice I read all of Paul's Epistles just two hours of just straight reading and reading and I know how the scripture reads that's why I know I wasn't unable to find it but then all of a sudden I found it they said corintios it's in First Corinthians 10 24. you can find it with me you don't have to wait the two hours that I had to wait I'm giving you the scripture right away just find it because there's a little text it's very little but it's very beautiful I forgot my water and can someone bring me yes it says it says let no man seek his own but every man's another wealth again but every man another's wealth and I want to get ahead of myself because I'm not going to be time my brother Rolando said he said my grandfather was the pastor of the church [Music] my grandfather was the pastor of the church then the father my brother is the son of his grace so they grew up in the message may God bless all the young people that have grown up in the message I want to give you a 10 out of 10 this morning may God bless the young boys and girls that were born in the message Emmanuel this morning speaking to brother Emmanuel I'm not going to mention what we said but I was interested we were back there alone and it's a great privilege to be born in a church that already believes in the message of the hour but let me say something though you were born in the message of the hour pero muchos de Nosotros but many of us many of us we we go we go astray from the message of the hour we knew the message we were born in the message we would go to church but we grew up Amigos and the brother mentioned friends he mentioned friends you know what the Bible says about friends now there's friends I am Migos there's friends and we consider each other here friends glory to his name amen amen if you invite me to your house imagine I come to your house you say come on Juanito have a drink just imagine that I'd fall over how is it possible how is it possible it's going to be late for me to come to church to tell you this is foreign and he says don't worry we all have a weakness and this is my weakness he was he was out puffing out smokes he said I'm sorry this is my weakness and he started drinking and the third one you couldn't believe it as well he would look at one and look at the other yeah and they would also look at him he says well you're the only one that's left what's your weaknesses but since they were insisting so much I said being that you're insistence my weakness is I like talking a lot about others [Music] and it's getting late for me to head back to the city to tell all the brothers what you two are doing can you imagine that is another thing that he told us the mother of the little one and say brother please pray for my son and the preacher said that he got close and he got close and he took off his belt as soon as he took off his belt the little child song right quick got up yeah yeah yeah I'm good I'm over it yeah yeah he's I'm good yes I'm over this I don't know how many of us would this happen to yes I'm over this we would just look at the belt of course he brought his tools here one of the things that the mother throw at us since they don't have anything else to throw at us I'm speaking about Council [Music] [Music] [Music] all these years is algo real that structure for me is something that is real yo I tried to live it every day I tried to put it into action every day so glory to his name let no man seek his own but every man another's wealth Let's uh do a favor we don't ever know when we'll be the one that needs one time I was coming from a trip from Mexico it was getting dark and I find a man a grandfather and his wife standing next to the car on the side of the road and here I come is and I can see that they're behind the car looking at the traffic I pull over and stop and I asked them do you need anything this is our tire got flat he says I said don't worry I'm going to help you I put my tie over my shoulders I still had my suit on I got all the tools they brought out all they knew that they had to bring out but they were struggling I helped them I put their Tire in the back and the man came up to me and said mister can you please take these twenty dollars I said sir this favor I did was from all my heart if I take those twenty dollars it would be like a sort of a piece and I did it with with all my heart I said just keep it to yourself and it's a pleasure to have met you whenever you can do a favor for someone else memorize the scripture every man another as well Council of eternal life now when we go to school they begin to give us advice about what the subject matter of the classes I mentioned before that I loved history I would always get very good grades in history but when it would come to math I would get really poor grades I wasn't in my second year and I still didn't know neither how to subtract nor multiply because math math is something that just would not call my attention at all the teacher would say Juanito I want you to stay so you can study math a bit more or no no no yeah I said no no no there's water in the river it's coming Downstream I gotta go swimming now remember on Friday we have to go play soccer football and that was my three I was a player that really liked soccer yes you can ask me about Pancho Villa [Applause] [Music] you can just ask I love it and enjoy history no so I don't know how many of you can still remember I have a piece of advice your father gave you [Music] I don't know how many can remember that but there are parents that give counselor advice and you know what they tried to carry it out that's something beautiful her brother Louise you had a place to go take his wife he was concerned that he would have a place where he can take his wife so our parents gave us very good pieces of advice and we remember them it doesn't matter our age if we're 30 40 50 or 60. if you can open your Bible to First Chronicles in the Old Testament first and second oh sorry we in first Chronicles it's a scripture that I really love so much I really like it first Chronicles chapter 28 we'll be in verse 9. Gloria dios praise God how many Founders did you find it look at the beautiful it's a father giving advice to his son just like our parents would give us advice advice as a servant with the perfect heart David knew of his failures one day he had to make a choice and many died because of the choice he made he spilled a lot of blood that's why the Lord did not allow him to build the temple because even Nathan didn't know he was a prophet he was a prophet cuando because when David say to Nathan Palacio says I live in the palace [Applause] do all that's according to your heart this is because the Lord is with you amen amen so he says do all and when what that means is I don't think he was expecting it to hear that before Nathan left the palace to his Prophet is just give them these words I took you out of your father's Sheepfold amen and it says for the Lord's churches All Hearts imagination and understand that all the imagination of the thoughts what we think right now he already knows Hermanos you can be sure of that is he knows how many hairs we have on our head you can say brothers that's God he knows how many hairs we have in our head you know how many hairs fall off of your head when you took a shower this morning he said brother I don't worry about that I don't take a shower I don't think I had any hair that fell off he knows everything glory to his name [Music] [Music] if your foot is gonna step on it just stretch your foot out a bit is if thou seek Him He will be found of thee um that's the Council of a father to his son that should be our Council that we give to our sons and thou seek Him He will be found forsake Him He will cast thee off forever there is a blessing and there is a curse if you do it it's a blessing but if you don't do it he has his consequences now go to the Book of Matthew we're going to read one more scripture Mateo it's in the Book of Matthew I think it's in chapter seven Gloria senor glory to the Lord contentos Hermanos you happy yeah for eternal life consecutors verse 24 says [Applause] he said therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and do with them once again therefore whosoever heareth these Saints and do with them what is he going to do whatever those words say therefore whosoever these sayings of mine he says I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon Iraq how many this morning glory to his name let there be no doubt we're built on the Rocks if we're in the sand we're going to suffer a great loss built on the Rock then this or the other can come yeah and will still remain glory to his name amen brothers and the rain descending and the floods came and the wind's blue palabras [Applause] adhere at these sayings he says that heareth and and then he says and do with them to a foolish man which built his house upon the sand who built his house upon the sand it is and the rain descended and the floods came and the wind blew and the and beat upon the house and it fell and great was the fall of it because did he here he heard but he didn't do it amen amen there's a message that brother Brandon preached he preached it in 1962.0407 and the message he called the signs of his coming correcto says how can you tell brother Branham what's right or wrong that's a good question he says uh how can you tell brother Branham what's right or wrong once again I think about bro what brothers was here sitting down this morning how many of us would like to come sit next you say oh praise God brother he knew the intentions of the thoughts of the heart he already knew that those Europeans okay no and I so think with a lot of fear and trembling because he was a man that was able to discern but Legacy is that right well what a privilege it would be to have them Among Us how can you tell brother Branham was right or wrong give them the word that'll tell whether they're right or wrong stay right with that word and see what happens it says just throw the word down there and see where they're at Rapido is I was once pastoring in Denver Colorado I pastored because of a necessity I had a communion with the brothers of San Francisco and uh and then they called me over the phone and said we need to come over but come over to the come buy a plane ticket and come over because we have big news we have something that we have to tell you that someone they didn't want to stay over the phone I bought my plane tickets Via San Francisco Rincon I went to San Francisco when I get there when we go into the office and I get together with four or five of them it is that the time is so close that there is no time to get married anymore and the brothers that are married it's no longer time to be spent and they no longer have time to spend with them I'm not saying that I'm just saying the news that they gave me and it was big news and I'm just hearing them the young people can no longer get married and the ones that are married can't spend time or their lives anymore why is this because the time is now here I said Brothers that's why you brought me here all the way from Denver I believe in getting married I believe in uh marrying sisters if someone wants to get married that's fine we'll let them get married and spending time with our wives it's something that's biblical we have to live together in cohabits Hermanos so that those big news really sounded weird to me I gave them some questions I gave them some of Paul scriptures and we didn't uh end up being in agreement and it was the last time that I was there for a lot of years what is happening when we hear something what we have to do is stay with the words give them the word give them the scriptures if they're not willing to listen to the message nor the scriptures then we have to separate ourselves there's no other way amen amen now brother Brandon keeps saying he says oh wow he says you can see what happens just as throw the word down there and see where they're at oh this is oh wow just get right away right then right then and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the promises to Every Generation seed to every generation says see that's us when he says to every generation he says see that's us that means us but notice what he says he says but it's conditions this is foreign aren't you happy for that this morning glory to his name amen amen they say it says but it's conditions you just can't get it anyway he says you've got to follow instructions now what are instructions Council to the coffee place or to his office the brother has a chair for himself and he has two more chairs there he's going to tell us to sit down and tell me what is it that I can help you with we come to ask for it that's what we all should do whenever we need advice whenever we need advice amen he says but you've got to follow instructions quickly 1956 on the 2nd of October yes this is now look at the at this little story read between the lines read between the lines amen amen read between the lines for us today amen amen we should read between the lines what is it that won't help us and if we read between you're going to say that's for me that piece of advice is for me blessed be the name of the Lord so read between the lines where's bear says why look at these little children going out and making fun of this preacher that was bald headed look what they said to him he says go up that bald head like Elijah won't you hey they didn't believe that Elijah they doubted it their parents wouldn't believe that the preachers of that day didn't believe it just the wind carried him away and moved them somewhere else but the the many of the people didn't believe that Elijah was carried into Heaven by a world but I do believe it this morning I believe in and I also believe that you believe Elijah was uh caught away glory to his name Enoch was translated because this is an example of those that will be also caught up if he allows it amen Brothers the random says he says how can you expect your children here he's speaking to the parents how can you inspect your children to be just cuando usted when you're putting such an example before them how can you expect to do that you're the best example that they have Guinness the parents are you are the best example that they have brothers if not they'll look for another example outside there's friends that they have out there there's friends that are out there because they think at home because you have no time for them let me give you some news he wants to be a prophet that shows me that at home he's being taught of the Prophet sister Marta in Mexico there was a little child he could barely talk and when we got home we would ask because we were looking at the picture of the Prophet that they had and we will tell the little child I think his name was Josue we would say we would say who is he would just stare at it the prophet a little guy this is the prophet he couldn't say Prophet he's the prophet amen amen but they had that portrait hanging on the wall foreign because his dad was here but it was the prophet Brothers bet the Bible says I won't read it train up a child in his way and when he grows old he will not depart from it the devil will come and we'll sift him he did it with my children he sifted them but a father and a mother are praying for years and years and years and finally they're coming to the feet of the Lord John Paul's here this morning and Jonathan's here right here his wife is here foreign just to hear God's word let them serve God let them serve God and let God decide in the end but I told you the story of in McDowell about John Curry Satan we're coming right down Satan will write down all the things you did and every so often he comes and he blocks it says this is one of them here's the next one yes and when he's about at 10. he says you can read me three complete pictures but let me tell you something and we know he came he was born and grew up the Bible doesn't narrate what he did when he was about five six seven eight years of age but I can assure you he wasn't out with stones breaking windows he wasn't hitting bunnies at the age of 12. foreign the water is here baptism is for everyone from the beginning that your age of accountability begins but Satan has everything that you did written down he also has his own book yes he knows how to get to you if you drink he's going to tempt you with beer yes but I think God this morning did not smoke no tomorrow neither drink neither use curse words I have someone that told me that I know he didn't do it and I believe it with all my heart he didn't do it that moves my heart young people that grew up in the message children or parents that were of the message [Music] to so many people that has happened and I believe to many other people that will happen May God help us this morning I wasn't able to finish I'll finish something but it's Council that's if we do it for eternal life that's if you do it tremendous when the Devil comes and shows you that long sheep a paper of what you've done don't get nostalgic or sad just think about what he did on Calvary just think that he paid the price now he will give you eternal life then you can say you're a liar you're a liar he already forgave me you can show me a list he's repeating to me all that I've done and yeah but he already forgave me glory to his name still have any doubt then this morning you can leave without any doubts Lord I want to give you my burdens I want to leave you everything here Lord I love you with all my heart Hermanos palabras Brothers It's words Council of eternal life glory to his name our heavenly father we're here this morning hearing your word if we do what we hear is that sets us on the right path that will take us to eternal life but if we don't do it there's another path that uh so many other people are walking in they think it's the path to eternal life but it isn't it so this morning Amigo we want to have a friend [Music] the friends of outside so try to drive us to do something bad that's why the Bible admonishes and tells us and advises us if the sinner calls you to do something wrong don't agree to it foreign his name is Jesus he wants to be your friend he this morning what he wants he wants to greet you
