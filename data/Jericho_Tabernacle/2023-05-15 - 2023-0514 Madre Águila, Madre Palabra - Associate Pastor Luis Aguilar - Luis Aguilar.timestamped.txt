[1:02:48] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:50] amen amen
[1:02:53] you may be Cedar Brothers amen
[1:02:57] are you happy this morning Brothers
[1:03:02] the first slide uh I'm gonna ask the
[1:03:06] brothers
[1:03:10] this morning we want to speak on a lot
[1:03:13] of subjects
[1:03:17] we want to title that mother ego mother
[1:03:19] word
[1:03:21] how many of you know que la palabra is
[1:03:24] that the word is our mother
[1:03:27] amen
[1:03:29] God is our father
[1:03:31] and the word is
[1:03:34] the one that gives us life
[1:03:39] and we just read the scripture in
[1:03:41] Deuteronomy
[1:03:43] it says just as the eagle
[1:03:46] the eagle
[1:03:48] let me open my scriptures
[1:03:52] as the Eagles stirth up her nests
[1:03:56] foreign
[1:04:08] the prophet speaks a lot about the
[1:04:11] Eagles
[1:04:11] [Music]
[1:04:13] and he's spoken about the mother Eagle
[1:04:18] how many of you have heard the prophet
[1:04:20] when he speaks about the mothers
[1:04:23] because the Prophecies of God types the
[1:04:26] eagle
[1:04:27] as the word or as God
[1:04:33] just like the the ego takes care of its
[1:04:36] eaglets
[1:04:38] the Prophecies of the word Eagle
[1:04:43] the in itself means the one that is fed
[1:04:46] by its its peak
[1:04:49] and God like himself to an eagle
[1:04:54] because God
[1:05:04] because the scripture tells us
[1:05:08] that man shall not live by bread alone
[1:05:12] but by every word
[1:05:15] that proceeded out the mouth
[1:05:17] in other words
[1:05:25] and God feeds his church by his mouth
[1:05:31] and the prophet tells us something very
[1:05:33] beautiful about the the Eagles
[1:05:39] he says that the ego builds her nests in
[1:05:42] the highest part that she can yeah
[1:05:46] currently I have an issue at my house
[1:05:49] I have problems with pigeons
[1:05:54] and the pigeons they want to make their
[1:05:56] own
[1:05:59] and I've realized that I can't really do
[1:06:01] anything about that and that's what the
[1:06:04] prophet says
[1:06:06] he says starts come to your mind
[1:06:10] we can't stop those stocks
[1:06:13] he says but we can stop them from
[1:06:15] building a nest amen
[1:06:21] is not a pigeon
[1:06:25] the eagle reaches the highest Place
[1:06:31] cannot reaches
[1:06:37] because that bird will burst open before
[1:06:40] it reaches
[1:06:43] but God made his makeup
[1:06:47] to be able to withstand
[1:06:50] to be able to withstand the height
[1:06:52] foreign
[1:06:56] we through uh trials and problems we can
[1:06:59] withstand the pressure
[1:07:03] we know that God is taking us Higher and
[1:07:06] Higher and Higher
[1:07:09] and then you think he's going to release
[1:07:11] you like this
[1:07:13] but that's how the ego is
[1:07:16] she releases her eaglets
[1:07:20] but the ego is able to withstand that
[1:07:23] pressure
[1:07:24] because she was made like that
[1:07:27] because it's maker God made her like
[1:07:31] that
[1:07:36] in a very high place
[1:07:40] in the highest mountain that it can
[1:07:42] reach
[1:07:44] there's no uh
[1:07:46] there's no coyotes
[1:07:51] had enough courage to go up there
[1:07:56] fall and he's going to break his neck
[1:08:00] because he's not able to withstand the
[1:08:03] pressure of that
[1:08:05] but the mother ego goes up even higher
[1:08:08] Protege to protect your Eagle
[1:08:14] take care of her from the Predators
[1:08:19] says that the ego builds her nest so
[1:08:22] high
[1:08:23] for uh safety protection and protection
[1:08:30] and
[1:08:37] they come out of the shell
[1:08:41] for how long is the eagle in the shell
[1:08:46] in the egg for around 21 days
[1:08:49] and the prophet speaks about the 21 days
[1:08:52] I don't have time to get into that
[1:08:56] he says but once they hatch out of the
[1:08:58] egg
[1:09:02] the prophet says that the eaglets they
[1:09:04] mount upon the wings of the mother eagle
[1:09:07] and then drop down to the grass
[1:09:11] and she lets them to walk and roam
[1:09:14] through the grass and then she goes up
[1:09:17] high you know
[1:09:18] and you would think that the Eagles are
[1:09:21] alone now
[1:09:24] and the Predators that are nearby they
[1:09:26] think that the eaglets are alone
[1:09:29] but the mother equals
[1:09:32] he's in the highest part of the mountain
[1:09:35] watching over her eaglets
[1:09:41] waiting just for one Predator that has
[1:09:43] enough courage
[1:10:32] that's the reason God likened his church
[1:10:35] until the Eagles
[1:10:38] because the Eagle's Nest which is the
[1:10:41] church
[1:10:42] I'll say it again
[1:10:57] upon upon
[1:11:06] the Rocks
[1:11:08] she builds her nest on that rock yes he
[1:11:11] is and it's the same way with the church
[1:11:15] it's not founded on the on the branch of
[1:11:18] a tree
[1:11:20] it's founded upon the rock is
[1:11:26] built far beyond the cares of this world
[1:11:32] and we see that when they hatch and when
[1:11:35] they begin to grow yeah
[1:11:42] and it's very precious when you can see
[1:11:44] a baby
[1:11:46] but that baby must grow a minimum amen
[1:11:49] Brothers
[1:11:51] if it doesn't grow then there's
[1:11:53] something wrong
[1:11:55] they have to start teething
[1:11:58] they have to start talking
[1:12:01] you don't want your babies to always
[1:12:03] remain babies
[1:12:05] all we want
[1:13:01] [Music]
[1:13:04] for them to come out of the nest
[1:13:12] [Music]
[1:13:23] just like the ego that stirred up her
[1:13:25] nest
[1:13:27] it's a time when the eagle
[1:13:32] that her little ones
[1:13:35] have matured plenty enough
[1:13:39] so the eaglets they have to grow
[1:13:42] [Music]
[1:13:43] they can't remain as English
[1:13:47] there's a time when they have to come
[1:13:49] out of the nest
[1:13:51] so then the mother ego now reaches the
[1:13:54] time
[1:13:56] now remember it's the mother Eagle
[1:13:59] it's the mother word
[1:14:19] she has to stir up the nest
[1:14:27] the word
[1:14:30] and God
[1:14:33] does the same thing
[1:14:35] in his church
[1:14:38] that is right there
[1:14:40] it's right there in the green and he
[1:14:44] says in God
[1:14:45] does the same thing
[1:14:47] in his church
[1:14:50] he begins to stir up the nest
[1:14:53] Mr kilo
[1:14:55] Vera is that right
[1:14:59] this is when we have all settled down on
[1:15:03] something
[1:15:04] then
[1:15:06] the mother word
[1:15:08] he begins it begins to stir up the nest
[1:15:13] Amos once we're nicely settled down
[1:15:18] [Music]
[1:15:19] we've conquered everything everything is
[1:15:21] nice and calm now
[1:15:23] and then God said all right I came away
[1:15:26] we got to stir up the nest now
[1:15:32] he says he brought Martin Luther from
[1:15:34] Catholicism
[1:15:35] [Music]
[1:15:37] and he says and they got so starchy
[1:15:42] that he stirred up the nest Wesley and
[1:15:46] said Wesleyan
[1:15:48] then Wesley got so starchy
[1:15:51] he stirred The Nest is
[1:15:58] when God is sending things
[1:16:01] we begin to get accustomed
[1:16:04] we begin to get adjusted
[1:16:08] but the prophet says that God does not
[1:16:11] want us
[1:16:12] he wants us
[1:16:15] to keep moving
[1:16:17] not to remain Idol
[1:16:20] or just to remain in one place
[1:16:23] God makes us keep moving and moving and
[1:16:26] moving because the mother a word
[1:16:32] knows what's best for her eaglets
[1:16:35] so then the prophet says
[1:16:38] this old mother eagle
[1:16:42] flies into the nest one day
[1:16:46] all unexpected to the Little Eagles
[1:16:50] so these Eagles were not expecting
[1:16:54] it was a day that was out of the
[1:16:56] normality
[1:16:57] they just thought it was just another
[1:16:59] common service
[1:17:00] it was just another common day
[1:17:06] but the but the mother Eagle came on
[1:17:09] a day for them and that's what the word
[1:17:12] says
[1:17:14] that the Lord shall come as a thief in
[1:17:17] the night there will be no calendars
[1:17:21] there's no scheduled date saying I'm
[1:17:23] coming at this time
[1:17:25] we have to be ready at all times
[1:17:31] I've been out Barber for eight or nine
[1:17:33] years
[1:17:39] state board
[1:17:41] I've never had the Barber State uh the
[1:17:44] board come to my Barbershop and then all
[1:17:47] of a sudden
[1:17:50] and then you can see all the Barbers
[1:17:51] they're they're rushing they're cleaning
[1:17:54] everything
[1:17:55] and says why are you such in a hurry you
[1:17:58] have to be ready
[1:18:00] at all times
[1:18:02] because you never know
[1:18:04] when the Lord will come
[1:18:10] [Music]
[1:18:14] a regular service
[1:18:19] maybe one of these mornings
[1:18:25] we'll be here in such a rush cleaning
[1:18:30] to get the oil for my lamb
[1:18:33] you must already have the oil
[1:18:36] this is your chance
[1:18:38] to have oil in your lamb
[1:18:42] oh it's because so and so in this person
[1:18:46] keep oil in your own lamp
[1:18:49] yes
[1:18:52] and this mother girl came in an
[1:18:55] unexpected day yeah yeah
[1:18:57] and then she flies into the nest
[1:19:01] and she'll take those big wings
[1:19:06] and she begins begins to give him a
[1:19:09] great gush of wind she begins to Flap
[1:19:11] her wings
[1:19:15] he says it shakes every loose feather
[1:19:18] out of them
[1:19:20] because we shouldn't have any loose
[1:19:22] feathers something that's too late
[1:19:25] just let it goes
[1:19:30] comes and flaps her great wings
[1:19:34] so whatever is tied to us
[1:19:38] can be come out that those lose friends
[1:19:45] with her great wins
[1:19:48] I Supply
[1:20:00] [Music]
[1:20:03] you shouldn't have any loose feathers
[1:20:06] Just Let It Go a man amen
[1:20:34] [Music]
[1:20:37] we're here at church
[1:20:40] and then we're we're now alone and then
[1:20:43] a time comes what we feel alone
[1:20:49] oh God is so cruel he left me alone
[1:20:53] even nature itself
[1:20:57] the mother Eagle leaves her eaglets
[1:21:03] they have to mature they have to fly
[1:21:11] it says to give them their first little
[1:21:13] solo flights
[1:21:16] and you can't have loose feathers when
[1:21:19] you're solo flying yeah
[1:21:23] she flies in and they have a mighty
[1:21:25] rushing wind
[1:21:27] they never felt it before
[1:21:30] why because they were English but now
[1:21:33] they're growing up
[1:21:37] he says because they were born in the
[1:21:39] cleft of the rock
[1:21:41] their Eagles
[1:21:44] but God changes it
[1:21:47] does God change
[1:21:49] God changes
[1:21:52] it's because brother I'm so comfortable
[1:21:54] I'm nice and warm here
[1:21:58] God doesn't want to settle down
[1:22:01] he wants us to move
[1:22:03] well we have to be ready
[1:22:06] and then he gives us some something new
[1:22:20] [Music]
[1:22:30] and it shall come to pass while my glory
[1:22:33] passes
[1:22:36] by that I will put thee in a cliff of
[1:22:39] The Rock
[1:22:42] and I will cover thee with my hand while
[1:22:44] I pass by
[1:22:46] that's where God puts us
[1:22:49] nice and safe and nicely taken care of
[1:22:52] them oh okay it's time and then God will
[1:22:56] say
[1:22:58] you have to get out of that rock okay
[1:23:00] okay
[1:23:04] I want to see how you do in a Solo
[1:23:06] flight amen amen yeah
[1:23:24] are even more precious than gold
[1:23:34] it's a deity
[1:23:38] you want to buy gold
[1:23:42] you have trials
[1:23:45] so then now the economy says we have to
[1:23:48] buy gold
[1:23:48] because the the value of gold is
[1:23:51] diminished you want gold
[1:23:55] then God said I'm gonna give you more
[1:23:57] problems
[1:23:58] Brothers I don't want any problems
[1:24:01] every one of us
[1:24:03] we have problems
[1:24:06] we have trials we have struggles
[1:24:12] gives us the trials
[1:24:15] it's not Satan
[1:24:18] is
[1:24:21] it Satan
[1:24:24] is God that gives us the trial
[1:24:29] now the prophet says that the mother
[1:24:33] Eagle is
[1:24:35] equipped
[1:24:37] to take care of her little ones
[1:24:41] that their experience
[1:24:43] is right
[1:25:00] to see that their experience
[1:25:03] is right
[1:25:06] amen amen
[1:25:08] the prophet says
[1:25:47] like a true eagle
[1:26:03] would be successful people
[1:26:20] [Music]
[1:26:51] [Music]
[1:26:59] [Music]
[1:27:05] because God gave it to you
[1:27:18] the Spirit came unto him in the
[1:27:21] wilderness I guess why
[1:27:23] it went to go test his experience
[1:27:28] even the Lord Jesus Christ himself
[1:27:31] had to be baptized
[1:27:34] the Lord Jesus Christ himself had to go
[1:27:38] through the world
[1:27:39] and the Lord Jesus Christ himself
[1:27:42] had to be tested
[1:27:45] and God had to know
[1:27:48] the mother words
[1:27:54] had the right kind of experience he took
[1:27:58] him to the wilderness
[1:27:59] to tempt him
[1:28:02] the Lord Jesus was tempted
[1:28:04] he was tempted
[1:28:07] and he overcame Temptation
[1:28:12] now notice a trial
[1:28:17] that you have the Holy Ghost is
[1:28:20] that you have trials
[1:28:39] [Music]
[1:28:47] the following week another trial
[1:28:52] sometimes I tell the pastor
[1:28:54] I think I'm done yes
[1:28:59] and then the next day
[1:29:02] here comes another trial
[1:29:49] that we are legitimate children if we
[1:29:52] overcome the trial aura
[1:29:57] oh Lord uh brother I don't want to hear
[1:29:59] about the trials
[1:30:04] I want to tell you something so that uh
[1:30:06] it can encourage you
[1:30:08] let's go to First Corinthians
[1:30:11] chapter 10 verse 13. you're the Lord
[1:30:15] Brothers
[1:30:18] First Corinthians 10 13.
[1:30:26] it says there hath no temptation taking
[1:30:29] you but such as is common to man
[1:30:34] he says but God is faithful amen
[1:30:38] Brothers
[1:30:42] but God is faithful
[1:30:51] who will not suffer you to be tempted
[1:30:53] above that ye are able
[1:30:56] so then we can see
[1:30:59] that God will not give us more than what
[1:31:02] we compare
[1:31:03] something that we are not able to Bear
[1:31:08] he gives us exactly what we need
[1:31:13] did you see and he says
[1:31:25] that we will have a wave Escape because
[1:31:28] of it
[1:31:31] that he may be able to bear it
[1:31:35] is there's the bomb
[1:31:39] s God gives us charge
[1:31:41] but God is faithful he's not Unfaithful
[1:31:46] he's
[1:31:47] faithfulness
[1:31:49] and he gives us what we can pair
[1:31:53] not only does he give us a trial
[1:31:56] but he also gives us the Escape
[1:31:59] he also gives us the way out then praise
[1:32:03] God
[1:32:07] he puts us
[1:32:10] but he also gives us the way out
[1:32:14] because he gives us what we can bear and
[1:32:18] he gives us what we can bear
[1:32:21] then blessed be God
[1:32:26] lord I want to be rich in your grace
[1:32:29] amen
[1:32:33] that changes your Viewpoint When Trials
[1:32:36] come to you okay
[1:32:38] because it's more precious
[1:32:41] if God puts you in a trial
[1:32:46] the same way he'll give you an escape
[1:32:48] from it
[1:32:50] amen Brothers
[1:32:59] ego is supposed to be a bird that renews
[1:33:02] his youth ah okay so then there's a key
[1:33:05] that lies there the best
[1:33:07] every so often no important
[1:33:11] no matter how old he is
[1:33:15] oh brother I'm old
[1:33:17] I can't change no more
[1:33:40] and turn you young again
[1:33:42] amen Brothers
[1:34:00] one glorious say there comes a time when
[1:34:03] she thinks the nest should be stirred
[1:34:06] she runs in Paris
[1:34:10] there seems to be something wrong with
[1:34:12] her
[1:34:14] sometimes we think that the word is
[1:34:16] mistaken
[1:34:18] is
[1:34:20] those eaglets stopped that there was
[1:34:22] something wrong with the mother
[1:34:23] there's something wrong with her yeah
[1:34:27] and then sometimes we think there's
[1:34:29] something wrong with the words
[1:34:31] but the word is perfect
[1:34:36] it says she looks over her baby
[1:34:39] she examines them
[1:35:03] [Music]
[1:35:21] he reaches the highest place
[1:35:25] I don't know if you notice that the uh
[1:35:27] the prophet says in his messages he says
[1:35:31] he says I can see it
[1:36:06] that the time came when Jesus crossed
[1:36:09] over
[1:36:11] and this is where the Prophet began
[1:36:13] speaking
[1:36:14] he says he went to gadera he said
[1:36:20] he says but he went over there at the
[1:36:23] Cry of one person
[1:36:25] how great is God Amen
[1:36:41] he can stop doing everything else
[1:36:45] just to go to you
[1:37:09] that he went over there at the Cry of
[1:37:11] one person
[1:37:14] this is one poor Maniac lost his mind
[1:37:20] perhaps a good man one time
[1:37:24] walk upright before God but notice
[1:37:46] got in the wrong crowd
[1:37:50] that has a lot to do
[1:37:56] never get together with the wrong crowd
[1:37:59] let me
[1:38:00] have a be quiet
[1:38:07] my bee started drinking or something
[1:38:10] and it lost his mind
[1:38:13] and he lived out in the tombs
[1:38:17] where the demons lived
[1:38:22] foreign
[1:38:49] he had an old gray-headed mother
[1:38:52] somewhere
[1:38:57] in the Bible
[1:39:02] that they would time and change
[1:39:05] he had a mother
[1:39:53] and then
[1:40:02] [Music]
[1:40:05] he started drinking
[1:41:06] foreign
[1:41:36] [Music]
[1:42:02] she
[1:42:06] took God
[1:42:27] praying for him
[1:43:04] she said I'm not I'm not losing any of
[1:43:07] my eaglets
[1:43:19] there is no other love that is closer to
[1:43:21] God's love than the love of a mother
[1:43:26] doesn't matter the condition of that son
[1:43:28] or daughter it's me he's still my son
[1:43:31] amen Brothers
[1:43:33] is that the same goes for God
[1:43:37] regardless of who of who you know it
[1:43:40] doesn't matter
[1:43:41] if you curse him
[1:43:44] he says you're still my child
[1:43:52] nothing to do with it
[1:43:55] but you're still a child of God
[1:44:00] for you to come
[1:44:04] there was another mother
[1:44:07] a colored woman
[1:44:11] the prophecies that she had a son yes
[1:44:15] and this uh this young man went astray
[1:44:19] you took the wrong path but this mother
[1:44:24] stayed in her position
[1:44:29] and she prayed until her prayer
[1:44:33] until her faith
[1:44:35] [Music]
[1:44:36] stopped a plane
[1:44:49] of the age
[1:44:52] just imagine
[1:44:56] you have enough faith
[1:45:00] my question is if you if do you have
[1:45:03] enough Faith to stop a plane where the
[1:45:07] Prophet is at
[1:45:11] help us Lord
[1:45:15] have mercy on us
[1:45:18] this mother
[1:45:41] to a colored a mother
[1:45:44] that woman is such a tremendous woman
[1:45:49] for God to honor us
[1:45:52] we have to be in our position
[1:45:55] we have to be praying amen brothers
[1:46:04] and the prophet of God was going to
[1:46:06] Dallas Texas
[1:46:15] and he stopped it in Memphis Tennessee
[1:46:21] the pilot said there's an emergency
[1:46:24] we have to land the plane
[1:46:27] there's an emergency
[1:46:31] this mother had an emergency in her
[1:46:37] and then the prophet got out hello the
[1:46:41] plane kept getting late and late and
[1:46:43] late
[1:46:49] and he said walk yes
[1:46:53] and that obedient Prophet started
[1:46:56] walking because
[1:46:58] he was asking God why are you taking me
[1:47:01] and then he began to sing those songs
[1:47:05] where are you taking me
[1:47:09] turn here turn here go through this
[1:47:11] corner keep going forward
[1:47:14] that is being led of the Holy Ghost
[1:47:19] I need you to turn here I need you to
[1:47:21] turn here and turn here
[1:47:23] and then he found himself
[1:47:29] a color sister
[1:47:42] waiting on the fence of her
[1:47:44] esperando waiting
[1:48:04] the seventh angel messenger
[1:48:09] not the first one second
[1:48:14] I'll send you the greatest one of those
[1:48:17] the seventh one
[1:48:22] so then the woman stood there
[1:48:25] Parsons
[1:48:31] how do you know I'm a person
[1:48:34] the Lord told me you are Parsons
[1:48:37] I'm here waiting for you
[1:48:39] well the Lord told me to keep walking
[1:48:42] and I ran into you
[1:48:47] and she says don't you hear about that
[1:48:49] shunami woman
[1:48:51] I was that type of woman
[1:48:56] being led by the spirit
[1:49:02] and she said let's come inside my house
[1:49:05] well the brands I've never been so
[1:49:08] welcome and ever in my life

[1:49:29] apart foreign
[1:49:47] [Music]
[1:50:02] Cristo
[1:50:05] and then the prophet says

[1:51:39] and she kissed him on his forehead
[1:51:43] she said God bless mommy's baby I
[1:51:47] thought
[1:51:48] mommy's baby
[1:51:51] that shows the love of a mother
[1:51:55] [Music]
[1:51:59] no matter how demoral and the Bots and
[1:52:02] old okay whatever it is
[1:52:06] whatever it is a mother's love
[1:52:10] Wades right on through it
[1:52:14] I thought if a mother's love would do
[1:52:17] that
[1:52:18] how much more will the love of God
[1:52:21] [Music]
[1:52:24] if a mother may forget her suffering
[1:52:27] babe
[1:52:29] but I will never forget you
[1:52:34] for your names are engraved on the palms
[1:52:37] of my hands and I thought
[1:52:41] she kissed them and now down
[1:52:45] well I asked her
[1:52:47] I asked her
[1:53:22] lord I can't do it anymore
[1:53:26] fight against you anymore
[1:53:29] she raised up her hand and the prayer is
[1:53:33] your sins
[1:53:35] he says I just cried like a baby
[1:53:40] holding the foot
[1:53:42] that little old foot sorry
[1:53:45] of that little old bed
[1:53:49] that little old iron posters
[1:53:52] I held to that bed
[1:53:57] and cry when that Old Saint poured out
[1:54:00] her heart to God
[1:54:02] the prophet cried
[1:54:07] I have never heard such in my life she
[1:54:10] said
[1:54:11] notice the prayer of this month
[1:54:16] I've done the best that I could
[1:54:21] you know I washed over the washboard for
[1:54:24] the white folks
[1:54:26] she said and I tried to take him to
[1:54:28] church
[1:54:31] but he got with the wrong company
[1:54:34] now dear Lord
[1:54:36] you taking him home
[1:54:41] and don't let them die a sinner
[1:54:45] don't let them die as a sinner
[1:54:50] Lord let me have some consolation in my
[1:54:53] heart
[1:54:54] let me have peace
[1:55:02] Lord give me consolation in my heart
[1:55:06] and my baby is safe
[1:55:08] and that you've taken him again and she
[1:55:12] said
[1:55:13] your Parson is here now she said Lord
[1:55:18] I just pray that you'll do it
[1:55:22] but like that and when she said amen
[1:55:28] wiping those old black cheeks reached
[1:55:31] over
[1:55:33] and reached over and kissed that boy
[1:55:36] again
[1:55:38] brother something swept through my heart
[1:55:44] she hugged him in her arms like that
[1:55:51] and said mommy's baby
[1:55:54] that's a mother's love
[1:55:57] and then the prophet grabs
[1:56:00] and began to pray for him
[1:56:38] Christian
[1:56:55] not only did he heal him
[1:56:59] but he also sent his Prophet through
[1:57:01] their way amen Brothers
[1:57:04] all things are possible
[1:57:07] if you can only believe
[1:57:10] you have to let go of the loose feathers

[1:57:25] daughter Lord bring them in
[1:57:29] give me a consolation in my heart
[1:57:32] I don't want them to go
[1:57:35] I want peace in my heart
[1:57:42] there was another young boy in the Bible
[1:57:46] that asked his father
[1:57:48] for his inheritance he said father
[1:57:53] um
[1:57:54] one day this boy he said
[1:57:57] I want my cut of the inheritance
[1:58:20] and I want to leave this place
[1:58:24] the father said well
[1:58:25] that's fine if that's what you want
[1:58:30] the father sold everything gave him his
[1:58:32] inheritance and he gave him his
[1:58:34] inheritance
[1:58:39] and the mother went with the father her
[1:58:42] husband
[1:58:43] and he said what are you doing
[1:58:46] why are you letting him go
[1:58:49] I don't want him to leave
[1:58:52] he's still too young
[1:58:55] the father said I can't stop him he's of
[1:59:00] age now
[1:59:02] he knows the difference between goodness
[1:59:05] he knows what's right you know what he
[1:59:08] know what's wrong
[1:59:10] I did everything I could to instructions
[1:59:12] I can't do anymore
[1:59:16] and she asked what can we do
[1:59:19] the husband said well we have to let him
[1:59:21] go
[1:59:23] um
[1:59:24] we know that he's called The Prodigal
[1:59:27] Son he wanted his inheritance
[1:59:31] he went and he went to go spend all of
[1:59:34] his money
[1:59:35] he went with his friends
[1:59:38] but then a Time came
[1:59:40] when he lost his mind
[1:59:43] and that's what happens
[1:59:46] when the Holy Ghost leaves us
[2:00:02] in the Corral of
[2:00:05] gown
[2:00:07] Elementary
[2:00:09] they would even feed him pig food
[2:00:13] maybe mom and dad
[2:00:16] every day they would think about him
[2:00:19] they would come the church they would
[2:00:21] pray for him
[2:00:23] another service that would come and pray
[2:00:25] for us
[2:00:27] Mother's Day came and
[2:00:36] the prophet says
[2:00:40] there was a mother
[2:00:43] and father that were very restless it's

[2:01:45] and roll
[2:01:47] he said we have to get her on our knees
[2:01:50] and put her in the hands of the Lord
[2:01:54] even the prophet himself
[2:01:56] had to pray for his children
[2:02:00] and give them over to the hands of the
[2:02:03] Lord he said let's pray
[2:02:09] I can see them get down on the floor
[2:02:12] and begin to pray for a little Juanita
[2:02:21] saying no
[2:02:24] saying
[2:02:25] wherever he is
[2:02:34] and send him home and the prophet says
