[5:36] is
[5:50] oh sorry
[5:52] i asked samara for permission to say
[5:54] words because um
[5:56] i told her she stole this song from me
[5:58] it's called alabaster box
[6:00] and that's it's actually a story and i
[6:01] wanted to say in spanish what it's about
[6:03] because
[6:04] i love this song it's about a woman who
[6:05] walks in to a place
[6:08] with a little alabaster box of alabaster
[6:10] and she
[6:11] actually there's a whole story about it
[6:13] she washes jesus feet with her tears
[6:16] but when she walked in the people judged
[6:18] and said
[6:19] this isn't a place for her what like
[6:21] what is she doing here
[6:22] and i wondered how many times
[6:25] we've judged others and we wonder what
[6:27] people what do what are that person
[6:28] doing
[6:29] and it was such a blessing for me it's
[6:31] like that's my song i told her
[6:33] so she i would sing it but i don't know
[6:34] how to sing so she'll sing it and i hope
[6:36] it blesses you
[6:38] god bless you thank you
[6:42] [Music]
[6:57] the room grew still
[7:01] as she made a way to jesus
[7:05] she stumbles through the tears that made
[7:08] her
[7:10] blind
[7:14] she felt such pain
[7:18] some spoke in anger
[7:22] heard folks whisper
[7:24] there's no place here for
[7:28] her kind
[7:31] still all she came
[7:34] through the shame that flushed her face
[7:38] until at
[7:43] his last
[7:47] and though she spoke no words
[7:51] everything she said was heard
[7:55] as she poured her love for the master
[7:59] from her box of alabaster
[8:06] so i've come
[8:08] to pour
[8:11] prayer
[8:13] [Music]
[8:25] don't be angry
[8:27] if i wash his feet with my tears
[8:34] [Music]
[8:40] cause you weren't there
[8:44] the night he found me
[8:47] and you did not feel what i felt when he
[8:52] wrapped his love and arms around me and
[8:57] you don't know the cost
[9:00] of the oil
[9:03] in my own
[9:05] [Music]
[9:13] i can't forget
[9:17] the way life used to be
[9:18] [Music]
[9:20] cause i was a prisoner to the sin that
[9:23] had me
[9:25] bound
[9:29] i spent my days
[9:33] put my life without measure into a
[9:37] little treasure box i
[9:40] thought i'd found
[9:44] until the day
[9:47] when jesus came to me
[9:51] and healed my soul
[9:53] with the wonder of
[9:55] his touch so now i'm giving back to him
[10:02] all the
[10:03] is worthy of
[10:05] i've been
[10:07] forgiven and that's why
[10:10] i love him so much
[10:16] and i've come to
[10:20] pour
[10:21] my praise on him
[10:24] like oil
[10:26] from mary's
[10:28] alabaster box
[10:34] so don't be angry
[10:37] if i wash his feet with my tears
[10:41] and i dry them
[10:44] with my
[10:48] [Music]
[10:54] jesus found me
[10:57] you did not feel what i felt when he
[11:01] wrapped his love and arms around me and
[11:06] you don't know the cost
[11:09] of the oil
[11:12] oh
[11:14] you don't know the cost
[11:16] of my price
