[1:09:10] thus when leo the tenth became pope and
[1:09:13] john
[1:09:15] tetzel
[1:09:16] came to sell indulgences for sin
[1:09:21] luther had no choice but to rise up
[1:09:24] against this anti-scriptural teaching
[1:09:29] entonces
[1:09:32] second
[1:09:48] first he thundered from the pulpit
[1:09:51] against it and then he wrote his famous
[1:09:53] 95 theses
[1:09:56] which on october 31st
[1:09:59] 7
[1:10:00] 1517 he knelt to the door of castle
[1:10:03] church
[1:10:21] now martin luther himself was a
[1:10:23] sensitive spirit-filled christian he was
[1:10:25] definitely a man of the word for he not
[1:10:29] only had a
[1:10:31] profound passion to study it but to make
[1:10:35] it available to all
[1:10:37] in order that all might live by it our
[1:10:41] martin luther old
[1:10:59] he translated the new testament and gave
[1:11:02] it to the people
[1:11:07] his laborers work he did himself
[1:11:11] correcting a passages
[1:11:14] a passage as much as 20 times
[1:11:25] he gathered around him a group of hebrew
[1:11:28] scholars amongst whom were jews and
[1:11:31] translated the old testament
[1:11:36] group
[1:11:43] this monumental work of luther is still
[1:11:47] the work upon which all successive works
[1:11:51] of the scripture in germany have rested
[1:12:04] he was the fifth messenger and his
[1:12:07] message was the just shall live by faith
[1:12:17] amen
[1:12:20] surely we admit that he knew and did
[1:12:24] teach that we are to go from faith to
[1:12:27] faith
[1:12:34] his marvelous understanding of
[1:12:36] sovereignty election predestination
[1:12:39] another truth show him to be a great man
[1:12:42] in the word yet i
[1:12:45] say again as do historians god used him
[1:12:48] to bring to the people god's standard
[1:12:52] against works
[1:12:57] [Music]
[1:13:14] the just shall live by faith
[1:13:22] it's
[1:13:23] it's a reformation age it's
[1:13:27] let's start it
[1:13:29] on this day in
[1:13:32] amen
[1:13:34] uh
[1:13:35] if if it would be okay with you could
[1:13:37] you please stand so we can read another
[1:13:39] scripture
[1:13:44] to honor the lord
[1:13:47] by reading his word
[1:13:49] [Music]
[1:13:52] the book of daniel chapter 12
[1:13:57] verse one
[1:14:08] and just think about it and then we'll
[1:14:09] go into the message
[1:14:16] we know that the word of god
[1:14:18] sometimes has double meaning
[1:14:25] it'll fulfill itself time and time again
[1:14:33] let's listen to this message
[1:14:38] and at that time shall michael stand up
[1:14:41] the great prince
[1:14:43] which
[1:14:44] standeth for the children of thy people
[1:14:48] and there shall be a time of trouble
[1:14:51] such as never was since there was a
[1:14:54] nation even to that same time and at
[1:14:58] that time thy people shall be delivered
[1:15:01] and every one shall be found written in
[1:15:04] the book
[1:15:06] tiempos
[1:15:08] grand principe
[1:15:22] libra and many of them that sleep in the
[1:15:25] dust of the air shall awake some to
[1:15:28] everlasting life and some
[1:15:31] to shame and everlasting contempt
[1:15:45] and they that
[1:15:47] be wise and shall shine
[1:15:51] and they that be wise shall shine as a
[1:15:54] brightness of the firmament
[1:15:56] and they
[1:15:58] that turn
[1:15:59] many to righteousness as the stars
[1:16:02] forever and ever lost
[1:16:19] but thou o day o daniel shut up the
[1:16:22] words and seal the book even to the time
[1:16:25] of the end
[1:16:27] many shall run to and fro and knowledge
[1:16:31] shalt be increased
[1:16:44] the night daniel looked and behold
[1:16:46] there's still
[1:16:47] other two
[1:16:49] one on this side of the bank of the
[1:16:51] river and the other on the side of the
[1:16:54] bank of the river
[1:17:00] is
[1:17:04] and one said to the man clothed in linen
[1:17:08] which is upon the waters of the river
[1:17:10] how long shall it be to the end of these
[1:17:13] wonders is
[1:17:21] and i heard the man clothed in linen
[1:17:25] which was upon the waters of the river
[1:17:28] when he held up his right hand and his
[1:17:31] left hand unto heaven and swore by him
[1:17:34] that liveth forever that it shall be for
[1:17:38] a time times and a half
[1:17:41] and when he shall have accomplished
[1:17:44] to scatter the power
[1:17:46] of the holy people all these things
[1:17:49] shall be finished
[1:18:12] [Music]
[1:18:15] we'll be uh
[1:18:18] paraphrasing some comments of brother
[1:18:20] branham vamos a para franciara algunos
[1:18:23] de los comentarios
[1:18:26] the greatest battle ever fought
[1:18:31] tremendous message is a two and a half
[1:18:33] hour message
[1:18:37] so i would recommend that you go back
[1:18:39] home and hear it a few times
[1:18:45] we just can't do any justice to the
[1:18:47] message by just speaking about it for a
[1:18:50] few minutes
[1:19:46] there's nothing out of place in heaven
[1:20:01] the earth is in its place
[1:20:04] if the moon won't move away from the
[1:20:06] earth
[1:20:10] if the moon will get out of its position
[1:20:16] the moon will get out of his post of
[1:20:19] duty
[1:20:23] the world will be ruined
[1:20:26] how important is your post of duty juan
[1:20:30] importante
[1:20:35] how important is everybody's post of
[1:20:38] duty
[1:20:43] we stand in our place
[1:20:51] [Music]
[1:20:56] the devil has to flee el diablo
[1:21:09] wearing the same
[1:21:11] same
[1:21:12] thoughts
[1:21:15] to go forward
[1:21:18] to stick with the word
[1:21:24] then anything can happen entrance is
[1:22:00] [Music]
[1:22:07] you'll find where you should
[1:22:19] in your post of duty in support
[1:22:33] the devil comes around
[1:22:38] we come against them
[1:22:40] [Music]
[1:22:47] let's start reading from line forty nine
[1:22:50] boy
[1:22:59] and i thought
[1:23:00] then if that great heavenly host
[1:23:04] like that has to keep its place
[1:23:08] to make everything in order
[1:23:11] what about the disorder
[1:23:13] of the earthly host
[1:23:16] says
[1:23:29] how when one gets out of order how it
[1:23:32] throws a whole thing out of caterpillar
[1:23:40] the whole program of god is upset when
[1:23:44] one member gets out of order
[1:23:53] we should continually
[1:23:56] to we shall we should continually to
[1:23:59] strive to keep the order of the spirit
[1:24:06] guard
[1:24:09] i would to god this morning that we
[1:24:12] would bring this to a real healing
[1:24:15] service
[1:24:16] that we could keep this part
[1:24:19] group that we have gathered under the
[1:24:22] roof this morning
[1:24:25] in such a harmony
[1:24:28] that the holy spirit will place every
[1:24:31] member of the body
[1:24:34] that's here this morning in such a
[1:24:36] harmony
[1:24:38] so there will be no
[1:24:40] that there will be such a spontaneous
[1:24:43] healing of the soul
[1:24:45] and body if we would just
[1:24:48] hold our positions
[1:24:56] um
[1:25:22] and that is the power of life and the
[1:25:26] power of death now that's only two
[1:25:30] powers yes
[1:25:37] there's only two powers solo
[1:25:53] of harm
[1:25:56] and satan can only his power he's got
[1:26:01] is the perverted power of god
[1:26:05] it isn't no real
[1:26:17] it's a perversion of god's power
[1:26:21] everything that satan has
[1:26:24] death is the is only a perverted life
[1:26:36] a lie is only the truth mistold see
[1:26:42] adultery is a act misused
[1:26:46] a righteous act misused see
[1:26:49] everything that satan has
[1:26:52] got this something that was
[1:26:54] perverted
[1:26:56] but it's a power
[1:26:58] una mentira is
[1:27:14] is
[1:27:18] and we are today sitting here
[1:27:22] and one or the other power is
[1:27:27] going to control us our nosotros aqui
[1:27:30] centas
[1:27:40] so one or the other
[1:27:46] as the bible speaks wandering stars over
[1:27:49] in the book of jude
[1:27:51] foaming out their own shame
[1:27:54] and we don't want to be wandering stars
[1:27:58] wonder if this is right
[1:28:01] wonder if that's right
[1:28:03] wonder if it will happen
[1:28:06] wonder if
[1:28:07] how it could be
[1:28:09] don't wonder
[1:28:11] stay like those stars and of heaven
[1:28:14] as a real soldier
[1:28:17] at his post of duty
[1:28:19] standing there believing life and death
[1:28:25] is
[1:29:03] when i see the deacons at the door or
[1:29:05] the ushers
[1:29:08] puerto
[1:29:10] i know everything's going to be all
[1:29:11] right
[1:29:16] they're protecting our door
[1:29:19] they're at their post of duty
[1:29:31] that's how important it is to be at your
[1:29:33] post of duty
[1:29:35] is
[1:29:38] decisions are made in the mind the head
[1:29:42] there is where satan meets you
[1:29:45] and the decisions are being are because
[1:29:50] that god made amen
[1:29:52] that way
[1:30:04] once again decisions are made in the
[1:30:07] mind the head
[1:30:09] there is where satan meets you and the
[1:30:13] decisions are
[1:30:15] because that god made man that way
[1:30:30] amen
[1:30:32] you know i've had some uh personal
[1:30:34] testimony here uh
[1:30:39] i i've had a privilege to work in some
[1:30:42] uh places where people
[1:30:46] have tried i think i mentioned this
[1:30:47] before i i've tried to commit suicide or
[1:30:50] or drugs and things like that
[1:30:59] is
[1:31:09] when i tell this to the people that are
[1:31:11] trying to
[1:31:13] do
[1:31:13] you know kill themselves or or whatever
[1:31:16] they're trying to do
[1:31:23] even take drugs
[1:31:26] when i tell them that the fight is in
[1:31:28] the mind
[1:31:32] and everyone has that fight
[1:31:36] you have a
[1:31:37] good thought
[1:31:39] and you have a bathtub
[1:31:42] it's all in your head
[1:31:50] and when i've told that to people that
[1:31:52] have never heard it
[1:32:00] and they think they're the only ones
[1:32:01] that have that problem
[1:32:05] hearing different thoughts in their head
[1:32:10] everyone has
[1:32:12] but we've been taught
[1:32:15] to know the difference
[1:32:18] those thoughts are allowed to come into
[1:32:20] our minds
[1:32:24] but it's up to you
[1:32:38] and just
[1:32:42] that's what i like people when
[1:32:45] they tell me yes i'm going to do this
[1:32:50] i take them afterwards lost
[1:33:06] is
[1:33:16] [Music]
[1:33:20] amen
[1:33:29] if this church right now
[1:33:32] could put together
[1:33:34] and knit it together with such
[1:33:37] that
[1:33:37] every person will be in one accord
[1:33:41] with not one shadow of doubt anywhere
[1:33:47] esta glacial
[1:34:10] nobody here desiring the holy ghost but
[1:34:14] what would receive it if you could just
[1:34:17] get that certain thing fixed
[1:34:29] now there is where the battle begins
[1:34:32] right in your mind
[1:34:34] whether you will
[1:34:36] eyes on the comments
[1:34:41] amen
[1:34:44] but your mind accepts it it grabs it
[1:34:48] what's what is your mind controlled by
[1:34:52] your spirit
[1:34:58] is
[1:35:01] and your spirit catches the word of god
[1:35:04] and that's
[1:35:05] the thing that's
[1:35:07] got life in it
[1:35:09] it is
[1:35:18] oh brother when that takes place when
[1:35:21] life comes down that shadow into you the
[1:35:24] word of god is manifested
[1:35:37] if you abide in me and my words are
[1:35:39] abiding you then ask
[1:35:42] what you will and it will be done for
[1:35:45] you
[1:35:51] that's john 15 7. this is juan quince
[1:35:55] then what does that do
[1:35:57] from the middle of the heart which is
[1:35:59] the soul
[1:36:01] from there goes forth feeding every
[1:36:04] shadow
[1:36:08] center
[1:36:14] the trouble is
[1:36:16] the trouble of it is we're standing in
[1:36:19] here with a lot of doubts
[1:36:22] trying to accept
[1:36:24] what's out there
[1:36:31] you've got to stop that
[1:36:34] and come down that channel with the true
[1:36:38] word of god
[1:36:43] and then it goes out itself
[1:36:45] automatically
[1:36:48] automatically
[1:36:49] it's what the what on the inside
[1:36:53] that's the thing that counts is in the
[1:36:56] inside
[1:37:00] get bad thoughts
[1:37:16] what's in your heart
[1:37:22] and there's only one avenue that can
[1:37:25] come down and that's by the way of
[1:37:29] free
[1:37:30] moral
[1:37:31] agency
[1:37:53] what direction you're going to take
[1:37:55] direction tomorrow free moral agency a
[1:37:58] liberal video what role are you going to
[1:38:00] take
[1:38:04] as a man think is in his heart
[1:38:10] let me backtrack a little bit free moral
[1:38:13] agency come into the soul by your
[1:38:15] thoughts
[1:38:16] as a man think it in his heart so is he
[1:38:21] if you say to this mountain move and
[1:38:23] don't doubt it in your heart but believe
[1:38:25] that
[1:38:27] what you have said will come to pass you
[1:38:30] can have what you said
[1:38:32] yes
[1:38:51] [Music]
[1:38:53] there you are see there's a
[1:38:55] battlegrounds
[1:38:57] if you'd only get that started first
[1:39:01] yes
[1:39:08] it's not affection
[1:39:25] it must be accepted in the mind
[1:39:29] then it's believed with the heart
[1:39:32] then the word of god becomes a reality
[1:39:36] then every senses of the soul and body
[1:39:39] is just scored out with the holy spirit
[1:39:53] then your senses of god your conscience
[1:39:56] of god everything that's gotten me flows
[1:39:59] through you there's not a doubt anywhere
[1:40:02] there's nothing can raise up oh man
[1:40:06] entonces
[1:40:23] amen
[1:40:26] there's nothing that can come out
[1:40:28] against of holy ghost-filled christians
[1:40:39] but if that channel has been cleared out
[1:40:43] and been purged and been filled on the
[1:40:46] inside with the holy spirit
[1:40:49] that don't even come in memory no matter
[1:40:53] about miss jones and what she did
[1:41:02] is
[1:41:57] it's you
[1:42:05] [Music]
[1:42:20] how long you can make the war linger
[1:42:24] it stop it right now
[1:42:40] gonna be
[1:42:51] hey brother don't you know this and this
[1:42:53] and stop it in this track hermano
[1:43:23] it at its tracks
[1:43:27] amen
[1:43:29] you throw aside everything
[1:43:31] and open up the channel and say god your
[1:43:36] word is eternal and true and it's for me
[1:43:50] if the whole church fails if the whole
[1:43:53] world fails yet i can't fail because i'm
[1:43:58] taking you at your words
[1:44:16] no matter if 10 000 died on the side
[1:44:20] today
[1:44:22] trusting ten thousand died
[1:44:25] on that side tomorrow trusting that has
[1:44:29] nothing to do with me
[1:44:31] i'm the individual
[1:44:59] i'm the one that's believing in this
[1:45:00] word
[1:45:07] not about anyone else
[1:45:20] i'm the one that's trusting i'm the one
[1:45:23] that believes it
[1:45:25] and we see back yonder if we wanted to
[1:45:28] open up the our channels then if we can
[1:45:32] and see
[1:45:33] we find this one and that one and this
[1:45:36] one and that one thousands of them
[1:45:39] testifying
[1:45:57] i wonder if we could go behind the
[1:45:59] curtain of time
[1:46:04] and talk to our past
[1:46:06] friends
[1:46:09] our loved ones who have gone through
[1:46:22] i have friends that have gone
[1:46:40] how is it out there
[1:46:46] just a thought
[1:46:49] but the devil will try to come right
[1:46:51] back see if he can get in there
[1:46:54] at all he's got your army routed
[1:47:05] absolutely
[1:47:21] that's why it's important for everyone
[1:47:22] to be in their post of duty foreign
[1:47:26] [Music]
[1:47:50] there's your battleground the battle
[1:47:52] your battleground is back here in the
[1:47:55] beginning
[1:47:56] back here in the soul
[1:47:59] back in your mind that's opens
[1:48:02] is
[1:48:11] the mind is a gate to the soul
[1:48:15] the gate to the spirit rather your mind
[1:48:18] opens up and accepts the spirit or it
[1:48:22] rejects the spirit
[1:48:24] you can have
[1:48:28] you can have little consciences
[1:48:32] and little feelings and little
[1:48:33] sensations
[1:48:35] all these things
[1:48:37] that has nothing to do with it
[1:48:40] that's just little sensations and things
[1:48:43] but when it comes to reality
[1:48:46] your mind opens it up your mind either
[1:48:50] accepts it or rejects it that's it
[1:48:53] friends
[1:48:58] la puerta
[1:49:26] is
[1:49:37] see it's in your mind
[1:49:40] that opens up the door or closes the
[1:49:43] door and listens to your conscience
[1:49:46] listens to your memory
[1:49:48] listens to your affections but when your
[1:49:51] mind closes us up to these things and
[1:49:54] let god the spirit of his word come in
[1:49:59] it blows the rest of the stuff out
[1:50:07] effect
[1:50:15] every doubt is gone every fear is gone
[1:50:19] every sensation of doubt is gone every
[1:50:22] feeling is gone there's nothing standing
[1:50:25] there but the word of god and satan
[1:50:28] cannot battle against them
[1:50:35] yes
[1:50:41] no sir he cannot battle against it
[1:50:44] now we know that's true
[1:50:52] see you don't reason with the word
[1:51:08] you know who reasoned with the word
[1:51:15] she reasoned with the word
[1:51:18] she
[1:51:35] the word says
[1:51:48] i like this quote
[1:51:51] we just accept the word upon the basis
[1:52:13] we just accept the word upon the basis
[1:52:24] it sets a stream between you and god
[1:52:28] exists
[1:52:57] just about
[1:52:58] done here
