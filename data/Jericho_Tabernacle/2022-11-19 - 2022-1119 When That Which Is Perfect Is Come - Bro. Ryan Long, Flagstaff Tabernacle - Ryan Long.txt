tonight to answer any call anything you need anything you need he's here and I feel the pool I feel that we all have a need we all have an expectation and I feel God will fulfill it tonight I just pray that each and every one of you are comfortable that as the word is being preached that you take what you need because it's yours he paid a price for it it's my honor to introduce the brother today it's our brother Ryan long nurse hermano Ryan long from Flagstaff Tabernacle we had the privilege to uh fellowship with with Flagstaff Tabernacle a few weeks ago um the pastor brother Steve Robson he was here fellowshipping with us yesterday and it was just a pleasure to be with them and and around the same word amen so as our brother Ryan long comes forward our brother Emmanuel Santos will be interpreting him let's just have a heart of expectation it's not the man but it's the word of God and when you can receive eternity from the word of God then Anything is Possible this tallest

greatest things ever and he rose from that great that's what separates Christianity from every other religion in the world we serve not a dead savior how many believe that this evening amen oh what a spirit in here you could just feel the praise coming through the walls it's praise from a people who know what it is they're singing about it we just feel welcome here tonight you know I never have stood behind this Pulpit or walked into this room until yesterday but I feel it I feel right at home my brother Brandon said I feel like I could just help myself to the ice box it must be that we believe the same thing we want to we want to get into the word this evening how many is expecting we've got a few hands you know you're going to get exactly what you expected and I I want to I want to ask you for a a favor could I ask you for a favor would you pull pull what you have need of because I can't do a single thing for you and I could read this Bible but it takes the Holy Spirit to make these words so if you would just do that and just pray Lord help that help those men speak your word this evening let's read a scripture and then you could let you be seated First Corinthians chapter 13. I want to thank the musicians and the song leader and those specials I can tell you I was blessed by them you've set such a lovely atmosphere this evening you know there's absolutely nothing keeping the Lord from delivering you of whatever you have I don't care what it is you have need of he can give it to you right now he's promised to be here and that spirit that you feel is him that's the reason why we've gathered here tonight First Corinthians 13. let's just read verse 10. but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away let's let's just approach him now Heavenly Father Lord we do not deserve to fill your presence as we do we don't deserve this word that you've given us but by the blood of your son you've made us worthy Lord you took a people that were worth nothing and you paid every price that could be paid for them Lord we want to give back to you our life surrender to you Lord we want to give you our hands and our eyes and our tongues we want to give you our time father concerns and the cares of the world just fade away would you just come now as you've promised in your word to do Lord and speak to our hearts amen you may be seated I want to thank brother Octavio for the invitation for the trust to let us stand behind this pulpitos want to just thank all those behind the scenes that are doing work right now could we just give them a little clap off we got brothers and sisters just back there working and working so we could have a nice meal so we could have uh Fellowship afterwards I just want the Lord to give them just a double portion if he would amen amen you forgive me I'm just want to calm my nerves a little bit and I'm uh I wouldn't I'm definitely not a speaker a public speaker I feel more comfortable sitting brother Gerald right about where you're sitting add in my Amen to the to the crown but uh more than what I want to do is I want to be obedient and you want to be a help so I could put aside what I want to do and stand before you although I you know it's a it's a little nerve-wracks hey man we comfortable everybody feel okay tonight this scripture just been on my heart for a while and uh you know once you have something on your heart and on your mind the Lord just seems to make everything line up with what you have on your heart and so everything for the last few weeks I've been hearing is just confirming what I had on my heart and I pray the Lord gives me the ability or he takes over with his ability and we'll speak to you this evening the scripture says when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away and I could I could say let's break this scripture down into three parts that which is perfect perfecto number two is is come then that which in part shall be done away and you say okay well I I can understand that you broke the scripture down brother let's just examine this for a little bit that which is perfect now this is not a trick question let me ask you what is that which is perfect because if you're expecting something to come you have to know what it is that you're expecting otherwise when it gets there you may not recognize it when it arrives brother Gerald spoke last night and said this statement and brother Branham says the evidence of the holy spirit is to be able to recognize receive the message for your day so in order to recognize and received we have to know what it is that we're looking for and there's only one thing that's perfect and that is God yes that was pretty easy to say Amen to that is all right and God is in his word amen so that makes his word a perfect word the bride of Christ has the perfect word in this day no I don't think that that is shocking it's not a surprise but do you recognize that word while it's here well you in order to do that you have to know what it is that word is saying amen amen now we were we were sent a Vindicated Prophet who taught us exactly what that word was saying to us and because he was saying what the word says which was God's message became a perfect message amen now listen if you take what the message is saying and it starts to replay in your life then you become perfecto now okay now listen brother hermano I was good when you said that God was perfect I was good when you said the Bible was perfect when you said the message was perfect when you said I was perfect I don't know I don't know about that and the reason why we think that is because they have mirrors and we can look in the mirror you know we can look at our own thoughts in our own hearts and we think well I'm not perfect when is it brother that I'm going to get to this Perfection here okay Matthew 5 48. which I think we know this scripture but let's just read it Matthew 5 48 says this is therefore perfectos even as your father which is in heaven is perfect he is not asking you to be perfect what what color are those are those this sentence in your Bible is it red what is this is Jesus he's not suggesting to you I think it'd be a really good idea if you were perfect would you work on that foreign Watson I don't know about you but that's a tall order the Lord God who created everything is okay he's not telling the group of people here we know that right we've gathered together as a church but this message is to the individual soul so when God says be perfect he's talking to you the individual individual which means it doesn't matter what the person next to you is you are called to Perfection amen amen that's good he doesn't say here's how you do it he says in the same way that my father is perfect not a different way in the same way he is perfect be perfect perfecto and then the chapter just ends and we're left with an order a Commandments from God himself that's a tall order and it goes back to this statement but when that which is perfect is come well that was a really good scripture when I was thinking about the word brother Gerald oh when I was thinking about Jesus coming to Earth but now that scripture it's talking about me habla de me now now if you're the bride of Christ you will take every word and find your name amen you know the bride of Christ is perfect it's perfect could we say Amen to that I don't think that's controversial right a statement like that can have two effects it can be encouraging foreign and the reason why it can discourage is because you see your mistakes or or do you not or am I the only one that sees the mistakes even if we've tried to say we didn't see him we see them [Applause] do something wrong and then try to go to bed with a clear conscience your mouth can say you're fine but your spirit won't let you rest amen amen so sometimes when you hear and preachers will preach the bride is perfect it's perfect is it a little easy to feel left out honestly it's a little easy to feel like well I'm not there yet right and then what the devil does he says yeah you're because you're not the bride is you're not the bride you're not perfect look what you just did this morning look what you just did the afternoon look what's going on through your mind look at this mistake you made and he has a right to tell you that is but too many times we care more about what the devil thinks of us and what God thinks of us and God will say something about us and then the devil will say something and sometimes we listen to the devil more yeah Diablo right we're looking at our flesh this flesh this isn't perfect that's the problem if this is perfect then we wouldn't need another body waiting for it and the problem is if you have a perfect bride okay trapped inside an imperfect body and if you judge your soul based upon your flesh you're going to put yourself out of the Bride what's this right here akimismo and then when a message comes across that says the bride is perfecta you live more discouraged animal then you came now I'm not saying you do this I'm saying this is what can happen we need to go we're judging our soul based on our flesh and what we need to happen is we need to go deeper than that and we need a word of God we need a spoken word of God to come on the scene at that moment we need something that is perfect to come because in my understanding which is in part it's just in part I see my goodness but I need to see that I am a perfected Son of God amen amen we must realize what lays inside the heart of the True Believer everything now now maybe this is going to sound confusing everything that has ever happened and never will happen and that ever existed lives in the heart of the believer well now you're like brother what do I do with that you said what lays inside of you is eternity so that's everything that ever was and ever will be and everything that never had a beginning in what form in que forma while God is a spirit God is eternal but there came a time when God spoke he spoke before the foundation of the world before there was time in his mind he saw somebody there's not a preacher in the world that could tell you truly who he saw you have to meet the Lord and when you truly meet him and you truly know him you will come to the realization that he saw you okay if you're the foundation of the world he didn't see a group of people now that sounds good but that has to be a reveal to you by the Holy Spirit and when that is revealed to you by the Holy Spirit you can never be defeated it has never be defeated again you might lose a battle you might lose a day but you have a victory that's already been won yeah because because what we're living right now is the manifestation of what has already taken place in God so if you know God you know what's taken place and you know what's about to become manifested let's read the scripture first John we doing okay sir all right I gotta I'm not worried about the time brother but I do have a timer running just just in case I believe it's chapter three our thoughts and that which is perfect is first John 3. everybody have it verse 9. whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin he said for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God thank the Lord for that it doesn't say that you can't sin because you have willpower you didn't sin because you're good you didn't sin because you deserve it no you didn't you don't sin um because of him this is for if our heart condemn us let's just stop right there how many cuantos could say your heart condemns you sometimes try to say that it doesn't condemn you since and I wonder if you have a conscience at all but there's another man living inside of there he's not going to let you forget that if your heart condemned you he is greater than your heart [Applause] and why is he greater because he knows all things see the beautiful part about God and this is the absolute Sovereign Grace of God yes absolutely he does not look at you like you look at you I don't know if I don't know if you if you could understand that does not look at you the way you see yourself you know what he sees a Perfect Bride oh yeah see no matter what any man says he doesn't listen to them you don't think the devil goes to God he went to God and talked about job and foreign [Applause] go try them and find out you'll find out he's my Perfect Bride why porque how can God do that because we're sinless anybody wake up and not make a mistake yet all right good no hands okay when so you say God doesn't see my sins God doesn't even know that sin exists because he sees the beginning and past the end into eternity if he saw your sins he would have to destroy you so if you're standing here you're sitting here tonight that's evidence he has not seen yourself what does he see we know what he says he sees his son slain he sees the blood you know there's a there's a there's a quote I don't have this quote it's in the message of Grace I'll never I probably quote this every time I speak I don't know that I've heard more tremendous words ever in one sentence you and I this is killed his son he says we nailed him to the cross with our sins and he said and then he takes the blood from the Sun that we killed and washes us clean of the crimes [Applause] if you don't know that God is I could see why you don't know that you're perfect that's the God you have to come to know he took the blood of the son that we killed that I killed again it's not a group I the individual I killed his son and he took that blood yes [Applause] clean limpio and to God it never happened I I don't know if we could just lay a hold of that it never happened my heart can condemn me still but he's greater than my heart he knows all things can I redo you a quote and this is from the unconditional Covenant that God made with his people we were discussing this the other night yeah you say brother Branham I've done something the other day and I'm afraid that the Lord won't heal me tonight does that sound familiar brother Brown says oh yes he will if this is just sit still he gives you two things you got to do are you ready foreign now that's hard to do I don't know about you you said brother repenting all I got to do is repent you know you know what I think keeps us from repenting uh our imagination imagination you know if I wronged my brother Emmanuel and I wronged him really badly yeah and I know I have to repent is my imagination will make that situation me imagination way worse than it needs to be okay I don't know if that's happened to you or not let's just let's just get right down to where we're at husbands esposos if you've done something against your wife and you know you have to repent does your imagination try to work out how that's going to go and you end up talking yourself out of it you've done if you've done something wrong your imagination makes repentance almost impossible with the relief the relief is on the other side of that repentance and I don't care what it cost you you got to get to that repentance not once a year not once a month not even once a day brother every minute of the day I don't want to be like that I don't want to think those Stars I don't want to be that man or that woman Lord I Repent I want to move on you might fall right on your face you get back up again always say brother I've tried that you said he said then maybe you need to repent he says and start moving on if there's something in your life that's causing you to fall oh that's hard yes especially if it's this is something that's causing you to fall you need to move on from it so all right he says you're a Christian repent for what you've done and go on he says don't make any difference this is the prophet of God now don't make any difference repent and go on he says you're scared the first little thing that comes along you turn your head away you think God's Gonna condemn you he says repentance he says in another later on in this message you if you've got the Holy Ghost this is if you've got the Holy Ghost now how many aura cuantos how many have the Holy ghosts okay I'm gonna I'm gonna I want to tell you something that somebody told me forever changed how I answered that question he said your hands should go up he said and the reason why is because you can't get it until you believe you got it so even if you look at yourself in the mirror and you think Ah Holy Ghost a holy ghost filled Christian wouldn't do the things I'm doing raise their hand up and move on and watch God honor his word by giving you the Holy Ghost not when you believe after you believe there's there's a quote that God can only do for you what you believe he's already done for you okay he can only give you the Holy Ghost if you believe he's given you the Holy Ghost so I don't care what you feel like I don't care if you were committed the worst sin right now in your heart from that sin repentance and say Lord I want the Holy Ghost and when somebody says do you have the Holy Ghost you could start looking back at all the things you've done oh you can come to this Bible right here that says whosoever is born of God it's impossible for them to sin is impossible it's impossible for you to sin it's impossible because I have the Holy Ghost but if you've got the Holy Ghost your God's child he says you have an unconditional Covenant Covenant Written In Your Heart by God Almighty who can't take it back he can't take it back do something wrong oh here's here's the Holy Ghost brother this is how God works he's not gonna take it back from you there's a quote here brother I didn't I didn't print this out but he says this is the Covenant people unconditionally God called you out of the world gave you the Holy Ghost the Seed of Abraham you are tonight with a blessed promise if your Abraham seeds you have this promise in you you believe God regardless of what takes place now listen to this the Holy Ghost makes you believe it anyhow you say brother I'm trying so hard to believe no you need to let the Holy Ghost believe it is I don't know I don't know did you catch that brother I'm trying so hard to resist but the Bible says resist the devil and he'll flee produce without the resistor inside brother the Bible says I need to be an overcomer get the Overcomer inside of you and watch him go to work everything that the Bible says for you to do you'll find out that it's really him that's going to do it the Bible tells you brother Marcos he's going to be the one that does it because you can't do it God's children unconditionally you don't deserve your healing that's the word of the Prophet is you don't deserve your healing not a one of us in here that deserves to even hear the gospel there's not one of you deserves the grace of Jesus Christ but God by Grace he did it anyhow that's right there's none of you deserve your healing he says every one of you ought to die me too brother Branham says we don't deserve to live on the earth that's right we don't deserve to look at God's creation but God promised us and he cannot lie he swore that he would do it healing belongs to us right here Hakeem right here akimismo oh it's it's lovely when I see my brother and sister get healed but I need it and this is a one-on-one relationship with the giver yes the Holy Ghost belongs to us you have ownership you have ownership of the Holy Ghost you want to talk about living below our privileges it's yours it was bought and given to you free of charge foreign you don't have to go obtain it is healing belongs to us salvation belongs to us the Holy Ghost belongs to us Heaven belongs to us now we're the sons of God and now we're sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Jesus hmm if we could just get this let me check my time okay we're doing okay soon all right that which is perfect is come then that which is in part will be done away what does that mean que significa it's the Fulfillment of the word of God a word of God was spoken and when he spoke it went out salio where did it go it went to the place where it would become Manifesto manifestation All Through the Bible the Bible says this all through the Bible the word of the Lord the word of the Lord came unto Isaiah we know Isaiah the word of the Lord came unto Nathan the word of the Lord came unto Samuel the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah those were who those were prophets foreign and all of a sudden you have Samuel yeah or Nathan or Elijah or Elisha or Eliseo speaking the word of God where does that word come from if God was there and he just wanted to speak why would he need a prophet he could just show up and speak yeah but this word when when Abraham is told get up out of your tent leave your father's house and go into a land which I have prepared for you that word was spoken before there was even time is there anything was created God spoke those words and they went forth into time and they were picked up by Abraham a prophet of the old testamental amen amen it was a perfect word when God spoke amen amen When God Says something it's just as good as it happening right then if God speaks I'm going to heal you tonight it's just as good as if it happened right there if he says I'm gonna manifestado and that which is in part it's done away yeah God before the foundation of the world he spoke a word now I I picked on brother Marcus how many who would be brave enough to raise their hands brother what's your name brother Isaac before the foundation of the world God said these words I love you I'm gonna die for you when you came to the altar yeah when Jesus hung on the cross before the foundation of the world the lamb was already slain and I love you and I'll do anything to have you with me look at my eyes you are perfect it is perfecto God is not stuck in time like we are you know where he is just past your repentance he's not waiting for you to repentance he's waiting over there where you've already repented come on to me I already see you yeah has repented before you even do it when did he save you when you raised your hand listen now when did he give you the Holy Ghost when you raised your hand a moment ago the foundation of the world it had to come to a place where it became a perfect words we have to accept what he's already done for us how did that word know where to go look Isaac how did that no word know where to find you is we say brother it's God he knows but he spoke this word Before Time exists how did it know where to come and find you because he placed in you back then and that word that seed yes contains everything that ever was all eternity everything that God is he put in and divided out to his his bride a part of me right here part of me right here no now listen you got to claim that is right who who did he send it out to I can't tell ambio right here a key I don't care what's going on around I don't care what I think he placed it right here hello can take it out of his hands isn't it great guarded his seed that he placed in your heart against even you mismo perfecto [Applause] it it's a paradox how could God see me perfect perfecto because he spoke a perfect word perfecta or or is any of us gonna tell God I think you got it wrong okay now listen if you say oh I'm not perfect Perfecto you know what you're telling god you messed up you got it wrong no we wouldn't do that but if you have the attitude that you're not worthy that you're nothing because nada we know we're nothing we know that yeah but yet the most priceless thing that ever was traded for your life so when I say oh I'm nothing I'm saying that the blood of Jesus Christ is nothing because that's what purchased me and if he took the Precious Blood of his son to buy you precious to be worth at least as much Brandon would say I see something greater here tonight he says I see the purchases it's time to start knowing what we're worth no no it makes you small does it make you uh does it make you look down on the world no no it makes you want them to have what you have as much as you want it yourself where you came from if you know that he saw you before the foundation of the world you want that for every persona now it's not up to you but the bride of Christ will not be crying for judgment he's crying for grace and trying to win souls the only people that are calling for judgment is someone who believes that they're righteous of their own self is now that's a rebuke to me because I've been guilty of calling for judgments that sin if God saw that but what about mine oh he forgave me brother hmm it's funny how that works I don't know I've been about 15 minutes can you go for just a few more minutes personal brother Brown says this and things that are to be in 65. our goal they say Joyride and prepare a place for you take you out of this pest house and deliver you into my father's house there you are take you out of this old Earthly past house he's gone to prepare a place a perfect place where no evil exists no sickness exists no old age exists I mean I'm not even older than that one made me happy yes no old age exists and no death exists he says it's a perfect place that's calling you to that Perfection and you have to now listen it does not say and you'll be perfect when you get there it says and you have to be perfect to get there in order to belong in heaven it's like saying I need to be perfect so that could be perfect it doesn't work that way the Bible said so Jesus said be ye therefore perfect Jesus even as your father in Heaven is perfect it's a perfect Kingdom so it must be a perfect people come when that which is perfect because you have to stand and be married to a perfect Son of God perfect I don't know I don't know what that does to you you have to stand and be married to a perfect Son of God so you must be a perfect bride so how can you do it through anything else which is the Waters of Separation that washes us from our sins the word of God bleeding blood yes sir she stands perfect yeah is perfect unadulterated she never sinned in the first place [Applause] I know what the devil's doing it through your mind things you've done wrong you might take his word I'm going to take a perfect word now listen his word that makes sense but it's not perfect [Music] it makes sense to this right here but there's a seed inside that he died to pay for my sins so that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost is beyond logic is beyond reasoning and what would seem to the world to be insane the seed inside can say amen I jaw these words Como how Como he said she never sinned in the first place she was trapped into it I'm telling you that I'm telling you the devil's going to God and he'll take the he'll take the Bible to God he'll say right here if they did this that was a sin against you look at what my brother did I got the videos is uh I don't know if that fires you up the Lord God can we say it this way foreign [Music] that's how now this is our this is our little brains trying to figure this out on an eternal scale what the Lord thinks of you now listen how do you commas become perfect yeah I said Perfecto we'll close at this the word of God and he said no put yourself there he said you right here okay perfect it's perfect and I love you and I watch you eat and you're mine it is Mia and everything you have need of it belongs to you because I I own the cattle in a thousand hills I own everything and what's Mineo it's yours okay those words they went out saliero you know when they went out when he was writing your name in this book I could just see him writing my name is oh I just can't wait till you're here with me I can't wait until you know what it is I've done for you and a perfect word salio if God does thing one way he'll do it that way every time is that the word when God needed to speak to Abraham he needed a prophet Abraham when he needed to speak to the children of Israel he always had a prophet amen amen and the word of the Lord came unto Isaiah he came unto Jeremiah it came unto Elijah it came into Elijah amen amen but now listen if he does things one way he's going to do him that way every time brother Branham Branham was the prophet to this age he said if there's only one member of the Bride you better believe it's you say now now listen I don't think that he believed there was only one that's not what he was trying to say is because if that's the case foreign because I believe I'm not one what he was trying to get across to us is that the word of God that came from a prophet is now a perfect word of God through a prophet uh the individual soul hey man I'm in now listen the word went out and you say brother you said this hermano I've searched in the message and I can I can see where I belong in there but like you said last night brother I need a word to me I need this word I need it to be sure now listen brother Brown says this he says let me give you let me give you about a two-minute background [Music] I was in the middle of a of uh I was listening to two sides of a dispute and this dispute was big enough to split two men who believed the same apart and one man made the statement only que solo the prophet of God has thus saith the Lord and it's in the word yes and the other brother said the Lord and it was in the word and I was listening and now you forgive me you might know the answer already but at the time I didn't know the answers but there was an answer and I knew where to go for that is just just I'm simple just break this down and I and I I prayed about it for about three months and one day I walk into church and I go to the library and I grab a random email it's not random but I never read it before and then I get to a paragraph it didn't have anything to do with the rest of what he preached and he said that's the way the church is a prophet today this is ought to be fully identified by the word of God is the prophet is and I got an answer is that both men were right and like brother Branham said you both believe the same thing but you don't know it and he says the devil's he says it's in the meeting God had explained he says the devil's got you pointing your guns at each other the men were saying the truth but it was were they willing to see the other side of what somebody else was saying and I never forgot that is but listen now if you individually now believe that he saw you and that he spoke your name and that those words went out they have to come to a place where they come to pass they're a perfect word but they're meant for a predestinated point in time pero foreign foreign Novia Eliezer told he said Lord I want this you can always have to do this and by that I'll know she's the one yeah and she listened to that prophet and then when her parents said you should stay here the parents said well what do you want to do Rebecca says I'm going with the service I'm going with they take a journey this is we we put brother Branham in the place where God wants them when we do this was to introduce because there reached a point the Bible says in the evening times where that Camel train reached its destination and Rebecca asked the servants is that is that Isaac is that I'm A Perfect Bride to a perfect room and when she saw Isaac nothing else matters who made it to the place where it was become manifested manifestation you are listen now you will stand are not going to be Perfecto you are perfecto you are not going to be sinless you are sinless because it's a perfect word of God and God idios he dwells both where he spoke it is it's the same question as how many in here islamism questions how many in here I do not care no importa what you do or your faults or your struggles I have them too how many in here present tense perfect perfect yeah now listen when you know that so it's because you know that he saw you before time before creation when he was thinking about what he was going to make I was in him right and I can know I I can't help it I can't help it I'm perfect so perfecto believe me I've tried to do something else he's not allowing it I am sinless you have to tonight that has to become a revelation to you and if that becomes a revelation yes though he's okay though he slay me I'll trust him oh the devil you want to take my life praise the Lord I'm perfect you want to take my family that family belongs to me I am the bride of Christ belongs to him belongs to me all salvation the holy ghosts [Applause] Lord senor it is not because Lord we deserve this it's not because we are good thank the Lord the Lord by your grace you have seen fit I asked to ask me to marry you Lord to take me as your bride for eternity it doesn't matter what I do Lord I'm perfect in you Senor perfecto and I pray Lord that if someone hasn't realized that before this moment that you spoke before the foundation of the world which strikes the heart of that person that you've put your seed in like they've never known you before lord it's one thing to read about a bride in the bible to read about to hear about the Bible in the message to hear a prophet speak about abroad lord it's another thing entirely to find yourself not because we're big gracefully accepted so good to us Lord it is [Music] Lord I pray you just take these these words Lord just words of a man set those to the side Lord would you allow your

covenant Lord to each and everyone right now Lord that believes upon you Lord in your Holy Spirit Lord will make them believe you Lord it will cause us to believe you despite ourselves despite the
