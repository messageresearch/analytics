This is how how do we get into this and I remember there was a veil a though that hangs between the holy and the holies of holy Christ and the holies of Holy Spirit Christ comes to sit down on your heart's Throne Cristo centrona Christ is in Thrones who enters the veil is called self-will and the only and only way that you can get in there is is to have self-willos you can see there's two types of veils we understand that in the old old times there was a tabernacle that was made that was divided from the outer courts to the outside and the second is the one that's upon your heart we know that Jesus himself is he is our example Jesus mismo Jesus himself he went through all these different stages that was in the Tabernacle una Fuente there was a fountain they will go and they'll be watched Jesus went to the Jordan River and was washed there was a bronze uh altar of made a bronze where the sacrifice was killed Jesus Christ Jesus was our sacrifice all these different uh things that were inside Jesus Jesus fulfilled each and every single one of them concerning the bells Jesus Jesus also fulfilled with the veil this is it is the flesh before he was arrested when he was praying the father let them I will be done but let thy will be done every human being has their own human self-will had their own will in the flesh but he surrendered his own human will he surrendered his body the Christian does the same thing you surrender your will you surrender your God your heart to God and then you surrender your body and then you serve God both veils have to be open adios unto God muchos God has a lot of problems with those who just opened the wealth that's on the outside those are the ones who come to church and they serve God or they just come to church but they don't allow for God to come inside their heart God needs for both of the veils to be open to him Jesus Jesus did the same thing Jesus surrendered his own human will and he surrendered his body and that is represented when he was on the cross and he said he cried in a loud voice and when he died and he surrendered his Spirit the scripture says the veil was ran in two in the temple most and surrendering into the will of God Jesus Jesus himself went to that and you yourself have to go through that you have to surrender your inner Veil you have to open up your heart and then you have to open up the will the veil of your flesh you will serve God aura personal and when a person has not been born again they're very similar we're going to demonstrate them here in the Bible in excellence in Exodus 26 1 remember the Tabernacle that Moses did reflect it reflects a human body or reflects a human being we just finished saying that both fails the outer and the inner reflection similarities they are similar Antonio's in the Tabernacles are also similar in Mexico moreover thou shall make the Tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twine linen and blue and purple and Scarlet with cherubins of cunning work shall thou make them now that's the outer Veil you can see the materials that contain now the Intervale in excellence Exodus 26 31 is made of the same materials and thou shall make available blue and purple and Scarlet scarlet and fine twinlin of cunning work with cherubins shall it be made you can see that the both veils are similar your own veils of your body and it's upon your are very similar on the outside foreign says it represents cardinal S as you can see that your cardinal s by your body when a person has not been born again they're carnal in their heart but when a person has been born again that veil has been ripped Jesus has entered inside the heart and inside their heart is no longer the Cardinal is specifically but Jesus was born specifically in El Corazon was born in the heart not in the flesh it was like a baby that was in a womb of the mother it was in a real close world but when the baby is born was born in a new world and that never wants to return back to that old world it's like being born in a new body and dances so then one day you will be born with a new body but for now but you only be born new in your heart Jesus manifested Holy Spirit only in your heart that's why your body that's why you struggle with your body sometimes one doesn't want to come to church sometimes one gets mad well this is sometimes we have bad thoughts made that aspect of your flesh or the Bella that's on the outside to be subject to the word of God there's two portions where your cardinal that flesh there's two different Grace that's why it's so important decision that if you make your own decisions you voluntarily have to decide if I accept or reject Christ because that Veil is called a veil of self-will doesn't matter if your mother your father I dragged you to come to church and you didn't want to come today because you found out that brother Emmanuel was going to preach I said I don't like when he preaches through that Veil that's on the outside foreign he surrendered his body but the first one that you have to open is the bill Within if you open up the veil that's within um foreign faith and this is the faith that overcomes the world foreign and revive that seed that's within me God will not just force himself in you have to open up to him the first one was the fine linen in Apocalypse in Revelations 19 8 says de los Santos it says and for her and to her was drenna that she would be arrayed and fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is a righteousness of saints the Bible itself says that our works filthy rags unto God the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints because when you open up to God you allow the Holy Spirit to come within you and you allow the Holy Spirit to work through you through you this great Forerunner has gone before us making a way he become from a spirit the great Fountains of the rainbow of God who had no beginning or or endos he was forever God is this ray of light went forth Amor it was a ray of love that's the main one red the next color that follows which was blue blue the trueness so the the current had the color blue so that represents the truth or trueness the baptism of the holy spirit this is says and then with the first great spirit of God which is love God like the great rainbows we couldn't imagine what he looks like but just say that he looks like a rainbow I can use espiritus them Spirits the perfect Spirit of perfect Spirit of Love Rojo redo Perfecto the perfect Spirit of fellowships they're saying I want to have a real true fellowship with you The Color Purple he was taken out into a public place and there he was robed with on a robe perhaps purple or some color of royalty so the color purple representative represents royalty and You by opening up you buy predestinations through you are Sons and Daughters of the king the soldiers started a crown of thorns and put on his head and they put on him a purple robeos and said hell King of the Jews and they smart him with their hands Jesus so they're making fun of Jesus dressing them as normally as a king would representative because purple represents royalty no that's in John when he speaks about this but in Matthew chapter 27 verse 28-29 it speaks about the same thing is and they stripped him and put on him and when they had planted a crown of thorns and they put it upon his head and a reed in his right hand and they bowed the knee before him and mocked them saying Hell the king of the Jews in Juan John this is the the road was called the color of purple in Mateo and Matthew he said the color was Scarlet which is it's the Scarlet or color red in English in English it says in Spanish says red also speaks about it also represents Redemption and the water separation I always think that the color red is danger the red does signify danger or alive but right in the scripture signifies Redemption through the bloodhub where she put the Scarlet strict down all through the Bible the Scarlet streak Redemption comes to read through the shedding of the blood and without the shading of blood there's no remission of sin and how the guy said go get this heifer that's read all over not one spot of anything else but perfectly for God look through red use what color red is when looking through red through red makes white intent try it one time Blanco red through red produces white so when God looks through the blood of Jesus Christ to we who are scarlet redo is he sees as white as snow expectations though your sins may be read like Crimson they shall be white like snow no remember it says the angel destruction was going to destroy that city is given the instructions to put that Scarlet streak yes and that was going to save her when the angel was to see it he will see the red sins of everyone and Rahab also had her since but she applied that Scarlet streak is Blanco and red through red is white so all the city of Jericho was was found it was white yourself to be sinful and you surrender to the will of God is always protected the way to the throne of God or to the tree of life so whatever God is there's life and to the Bible you can always see that he's on his throne so when you return back to your Bible in Hennessy you can read in Genesis there was a tree that was found by the tree by the name of tree of life but when they were cast out the Bible said there were Germans that were placed there they will guard the path to the tree of life is a tree of life representative represents eternal life eternal life [Music] no longer hindering you from coming to Christ but it's showing you the path to come to God but you have to open up yourself first if you don't open up the turbine won't allow you to come to God because one cannot live eternally with a sinful nature that's why Adam and Eve were cast out because with that sinful nature they didn't want sin to come to the presence of God but when the blood was shed and open up the way the blood covers you it covers your your red sins now the cheruband says that you're white and then he says come in now you can pass or apply to you it was not just a beautiful design it speaks about the things that you have to go through it speaks about the benefits that you will receive when you surrender to God that you yourself have to make from the heart is there's people that make decisions out of emotions the emotions have contact with this body by having faith in Jesus Christ that's very important if you don't open up correctly you yourself are blocking yourself to get to God's Throne the holy spirit is found there is if you if you were to be dead if you were to enter the presence of that eternal life is that thing that was there will return back to life foreign your body there's people that only Just Surrender their body coming to church week by week they hear the sermon but they never surrender the heart surrender the heart the the inside cannot open up is then he surrendered his human body personas the chirp is that allow for the people to get on to the to arrive to the presence of God physically yes and spiritually [Music] God dwells in heaven the Bible itself says that God has extended the heavens like curtains [Music] and it says my mom is waiting for you over there but here you do or the different dimensions or in different Heavens as the Bible says so before the blood of Jesus Christ was said no one can Ascend to Heaven foreign blocking the entry not allowing anyone to enter with a sinful body but when Jesus shed his blood you can read in your Bible Matthew 27 verse 49. this is many of the saints that have slept the path was not open yet to heaven lifted up whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for God so love the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life so we spoke about the cherubin we spoke about the sacrifice of the blood we spoke about the veil of the human flesh and the benefits of one when one opens up the veil application if you apply that is so these verses that we just finished reading you can see that verse 13 is a turban that blocks the person from coming to the presence of God no man has ascended up to heaven it speaks about the serpent that was placed in the wilderness and Jesus Christ foreign if we accept in verse 16 it says for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life if you open up your Veil it's in your heart you allow that eternal light is it gives you eternal life three speak about the same bill that's on the outside we just finished speaking about the materials but here is talking about the measurements here in verse two this is the length of one curtain shall be eight and 20 cubits and the breadth of one curtain four qubits and every one of the currents shall have one measure so it was 20 by four uh 28. it represents the cycle that the woman goes through oriente now there was three Hebrew children in the fiery furnace but the fourth one comes it was Deliverance Lazarus was the grave three days but when the fourth one came he was delivered four is God's number of Deliverance Anton says that Tabernacle represents the life and the Deliverance that he wants to give you an excellent stress in Exodus 26 3 . remember the veil that's on the outside foreign represents the cardinal s but obviously one does not want to be Cardinals one wants to open up so God can come in so by opening up it was separately made itself two fives number five La Gracia it's Grace gracias there's two Grace the first Grace is the grace of Salvation and the second race is Rapture in Grace so God give me of your grace by closing yourself to God you reject God's grace you come back to number 10. to your carnal nature but by opening up to God but you surrender to the God's grace and the message a paradox ES Joshua Hears A book actually it's a book of redemption the Old Testament Josh so we have to consider to be that the book of redemption because Redemption has two parts Redemption anywhere has two parts that is it takes two parts to make redemptions Saving Grace they will take you out of this world that's why it's so important that you don't maintain yourself being carnal if you make a mistake that's fine there's still blood and God's grace returns back to you you surrender so the power of Grace can work in your life yourself gracias so there's two Graces that's why the scripture says one the author and the consumer of the faith is the Alpha and the Omega recipient beginning in the end the Bible says his brother had the Assurance he that started the good work within you well take it into the day of Jesus Christ and the headstone and to show you is Zechariah 4 7 this is a great Mountain before the rebel thou shall become a plane and it shall bring forth The Headstone there thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace onto it the stone as it says in English it's the headstone as you receive to Grace now at my last ISO and they also make the loops of blue upon the edge of one curtain from the slavage into the coupling and likewise thou shall make the outermost edge of the another curtain in the coupling of the second this is shout out make in the edge of the curtain that is the coupling of the second that the loops may take hold one of another means 50 textures of gold and couple the currents together with attaches and it shall be one Tabernacle this is I even have an image if you can show it it says what the Bible says 50 Loops even the same curtain that's back here when it's opened up and the edge of every curtains and we have 50 Loops is when they'll close it again together with attaches and it should be one Tabernacle it says one Tabernacle there's only one God even though they open up and they manifest whatever's on the inside it shows all the different portions so once again when it closes it shows that it's one Tabernacle one God Persona and also speaks about one person there were 50 loops recorded remember when it was opened up it was five and five there's two redemptions there's two portions the Bible there's two fifties speaks about the number 50. this is now in the Old Testament the Bible says that there was a to be 50-year Jubilee that was seven times seven years it was to be made ready in the 50th year was the Jubilee here 50 means Jubilee cincuenta is 50 50 is God's Jubilee number significance the word Pentecost means 50. foreign of the Holy Spirit at the end of the 50 days it was also the end of the 50th year Jesus Jesus come to foreshadow or to form forewarn rather the people coming of the Year of Jubilee he went into the synagogue of Capernaum and sat down and taking the scripture turnover in Isaiah 61 1. and read the scripture the spirit of the Lord is upon me foreign everyone that was slaves to sin and bound year came every person will hear the trumpet and then they will make their decision is what happened in the Old Testament is that the high priest will carry the blood sacrificial to offer as a sacrifice and if God accepted the sacrifice of the blood and after leaving the Tabernacle the trumpet was to announce to everyone they didn't see the sacrifice that was done but by hearing the trumpets they knew that the sacrifice was made that he died for us and by hearing it we make our decision Now The Marvelous thing is the trumpet that was used not the trumpet or the instrument that we use when we played we play the music the trumpet that was used it's the Horn of an animal and this is trumpet turn into a spiritual trumpet turn into a spiritual horn now the preaching is that is a sound that comes forth from the trumpet it's the instrument that's why who he that preaches is only an instrument but that breath that goes through the instrument that inspiration that goes through it comes from someone else decision it represents a kingdom the Kingdom of Heaven has drawn eye this is so them as being a horned a trumpet instrument an instrument the message came through from Jesus Christ but it came through with the disciples said that Jesus gave power onto his disciples to heal the sick to cleanse the leopards because we don't know anybody it's God that heals but how many times have you been here because someone prayed for you so can somebody pray somebody healed you know but God uses an instrument here we have a good example Brothers but what God has done through him he is part of that Kingdom it's not his kingdom is the power that counts for the kingdom of heaven but it goes through the horn instrument it goes through the instrument allows the world to seem very attractive you close yourself by rejecting the world you open up yourself to God remember there's another world do you want to go to that world yourself to this one yeah and open to the world of faith can produce a new or make a new world for you he will not force you understand so remember La clavis the key is to surrender the inner Veil surrendering the will that's in your heart how do you do it confessing everything to God it's a God I cannot go against this but these uh these bells of the flesh does not allow me I'm going to rip this Veil Lord and I'm going to by ripping it I'm saying come in with your life and manifest what's already in me is to surrender to you within us to keep that bill that's outside under subjection until the day cometh that we should be veil with a new body we confess our sins the name of Jesus Christ amen amen [Music] yo [Music] I love it [Music] I've always believed so I believe no I am more is that where I go but I am home [Music] everything down [Music] foreign [Music] that way [Music] no [Music] I've been open way s [Music] for me tomorrow [Music] I know I know there's five things please [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] to be able to baptize my son-in-law he has made his decision adios he has come to show God that he has repented there's certain things that the human doesn't understand but only God knows when it's the time when the appropriate moment is as long as there's life then there's hope everyone that believes and is baptized shall be saved and he that believes not shall be damned on that day when they crucified Jesus on 238 and acts 2. [Music] they had already crucified him and hearing the preacher he said that it was a personal decision and Jesus made a personal decision between you and me well there is when he was up in Gethsemane Islam he was praying time had arrived he knew that it was time to die for the human race to pay the price for each and one of us so that we could have eternal life when he was praying he said these words senor said Lord if it's possible that this cup passed me by as a human being he didn't want to go through that but he said Lord let it be thy will be done for me and he decided to die for you and me not caring who we were not caring where we come from nor will we have done one thing that he did see it in you and me that being lost he knew that deep within our hearts that we loved him and it didn't matter to him what we had done even then he extended his hand and gave us Grace and in listening to the things that Peter was saying to the people I'm gonna read it it says in Acts 238 but I will go up to verse 36. he says right foreign [Music] everybody had known what they had done and they were pricked in their hearts so then in hearing this now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart less Hermanos and sit under Peter and the rest of the Apostles men and brethren what shall we do listen and then Peter says unto them repent and be baptized every one of them in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost this is his word God does not change and this night I want to tell each and every one of you that if you would like to get baptized that the waters are open but I want you to know that he loves you and he forgives you and perhaps maybe I don't understand many things but it's not my will but it's his will your name I didn't die for anything he died for you and every one of us and that's his decision one decision for eternal life we're going to pray we're going to be praying for him and that the Lord May bless him and help him and then he may give him the guidance of his holy spirit that is the only thing that can control us the life isn't easy is we're full of mistakes and many other things by his Mercy that's why he paid the price we're going to be praying Heavenly Father creator of the heavens and the Earth you know our hearts and you know sometimes we don't understand the why but you know why you do things in different ways that we sometimes don't understand but we're here to fulfill your word Lord Carlos Gomez here we have Carlos Gomez I place them into your hands I ask that you bless them and you help him that you fill them with your Holy Spirit and that he may be able to guide his family as well Lord now I place them into your hands you were the one that started the story and you're the one that will finish it in all of his walks in the rest of the days of his life in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ thank you have you been baptized into the body that does [Music] remember [Music] Hip Hop [Music] and wings baptize [Music] and foreign their response on Church bride or bodies [Music] foreign [Music] Love on [Music] ES I continue to Worship the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] what I know [Music] wiggle wiggle is located [Music] all I know [Music] wiggle Wiggles [Music] disease [Music] declaring the word of the Lord is gone away [Music] [Music] where are we cry [Music] thank you [Music] yes [Music] please [Music] shining myself [Music] knows Our Lives [Music] running over [Music] this is [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] for the many blessings he has provided foreign I mean that's all we have yes can you please stand with me let's go ahead and pray for the the petitions hello Heavenly Father celestial or we wanted to give thanks to the service you have provided Lord's sister always for the blessings you have provided you know we know that you you provide many more blessings to us Lord and we know that you will always keep providing these blessings Lord is healing Lord asked if you may provide that Lord is if you can provide Another Blessing towards his brother and you may hear whatever it needs to be healed Lord we are here we are about to dismiss Lord or I ask you to keep everyone safe take control of the vehicles so we may arrive here once once again in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you are dismissed thank you [Music] there are people everywhere [Music] it is [Music] [Music] I'm so fast [Music] [Music] don't plan that I can stay [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music]
