[38:48] this first time I've visited you here in
[38:51] this
[38:54] Tabernacle and I remember the first time
[38:56] I came to
[38:58] Phoenix Phoenix it was brother ber that
[39:00] invited me to
[39:02] come and I came in his convention and
[39:05] spoke at his
[39:08] convention and brother John before the
[39:11] Lord took him
[39:14] home I was speaking at at at Israel in
[39:18] two
[39:20] song and he came to the
[39:23] services and he wanted me to come and
[39:25] have some services with
[39:28] him and now your pastor
[39:31] here amen but
[39:36] Octavio has invited me so I really
[39:38] appreciate
[39:41] this and
[39:43] I I don't want to be
[39:46] guilty of leaving any confusion
[39:50] behind I pray is that God will bless all
[39:53] of
[39:55] you and I know that Israel introduced
[39:58] the brothers like brother
[40:01] whisper whis and certainly um I'm
[40:05] honored to be here
[40:08] tonight and of course we represent two
[40:10] big
[40:13] languages I represent the French
[40:17] language and it's
[40:19] huge in
[40:21] fact about 2third of all the Believers
[40:24] following this message
[40:29] is in the French speaking countries of
[40:31] the
[40:33] world so if you take all the
[40:36] languages Portuguese
[40:39] Spanish Russian
[40:41] English yes the
[40:43] French we bypass all of
[40:47] that a part of the reason is because of
[40:49] the Central African
[40:54] countries we we've got but we no one
[40:57] knows for
[40:59] sure but there's over two and a half
[41:02] million Believers of this message in the
[41:04] Central African
[41:09] countries and most is in and those are
[41:11] French speaking
[41:15] countries we are certainly grateful to
[41:17] God for what he has
[41:20] done and I am I'm the the head of the
[41:25] translation
[41:29] I got a great
[41:32] responsibility love you all and I
[41:34] consider you
[41:38] all God bless you did I say it right
[41:42] yes all right so we don't want to waste
[41:45] too much
[41:47] time I think sister sister Sharon
[41:50] Johnson in the meeting tonight is she
[41:52] here Sharon Johnson she rais the hand is
[41:56] she
[41:57] oh well sister Sharon Sharon I will
[42:01] never be able to forget you and brother
[42:04] M you hold a special place in my
[42:08] heart and it's really an honor to see
[42:10] her here tonight with
[42:14] us and of course my buddy and friend
[42:17] brother Mar and his
[42:20] wife my dear wife
[42:22] here amen God bless all of you
[42:26] now we will go straight into the message
[42:30] now and I prayed and asked the Lord to
[42:32] help
[42:34] me to be able to condense
[42:37] it see because that's what God can
[42:40] do God could take something that is
[42:43] really
[42:46] big and condense it condense it and
[42:50] condense it condense it and say it in
[42:53] such a few
[42:55] words that it will take all eternity for
[42:58] all of that to
[43:01] unfold and that's how God is and another
[43:05] thing quickly before we get to this
[43:09] message is that I I don't want to say
[43:11] this to be critical in any
[43:15] way but I've seen brothers that they
[43:18] explain
[43:20] stuff and nobody could understand
[43:22] anything that they
[43:25] say and people call that deep
[43:29] preaching no no the deeper we go in
[43:34] god is the simple it
[43:37] gets it's
[43:39] simple but
[43:41] hidden and because God hides

[46:50] scriptures and we will go to Mark 12
[46:54] from verse 29 to verse
[47:01] 31 Jesus
[47:04] speaking and Jesus answered him the
[47:07] first of all the Commandments is here oh
[47:12] Israel the Lord our God is one
[47:24] Lord and shall love the Lord thy God
[47:27] with all thy heart and with all thy soul
[47:30] and with all thy mind and with all thy
[47:33] strength this is the first
[47:45] commandment and the second is like
[47:49] namely this thou shall love thy neighbor
[47:52] as thyself there is none other
[47:55] commandment
[47:56] Gater than
[48:04] the uh then if we look at Matthew
[48:08] chapter 6 from verse 33 to
[48:16] 34 Matthew
[48:22] chapter verse
[48:24] 33 Jesus speaking here
[48:28] again seek ye first the kingdom of God
[48:31] and his righteousness and all these
[48:34] things shall be added unto
[48:43] you take therefore no thought for the
[48:46] moral for the moral shall take thought
[48:49] of the things of itself sufficient unto
[48:52] the day is the evil
[48:54] thereof
[49:03] all right now
[49:05] um father may you bless your
[49:08] word and bless your people as we thank
[49:12] you in Jesus name
[49:15] amen can be seated God bless all of
[49:20] you now I I know that all of us are
[49:26] aware of the fact that we must put God
[49:33] first but many
[49:36] Christians don't know how to put God
[49:41] first and tonight we want to look at how
[49:44] to put him
[49:47] first trust that will be a blessing to
[49:52] you now I just want to read for you
[49:54] something brother Brandon mentioned here
[49:58] quickly Amen in in the
[50:01] Hebrews and here's what he
[50:04] says he says now
[50:07] friends let's hear him the Holy Spirit
[50:09] speaking in our
[50:13] midst showing diverse Miracles and signs
[50:16] and
[50:19] wonders let's just not pass over it as
[50:22] just come and
[50:24] happening
[50:27] let's remember that it's Jesus Christ
[50:29] the same yesterday today and forever
[50:31] confirming his
[50:37] word we must do it oh please do
[50:41] it take
[50:44] heed let every other thing be
[50:48] secondary even your
[50:51] home your
[50:52] husband your your wife your children
[50:57] whatever it may
[50:58] be put it
[51:01] second place God
[51:05] first you say brother brandom over my
[51:09] children over
[51:12] anything Place God first let him be
[51:16] first of course we know that we live in
[51:19] a
[51:20] day where the Prophet tell
[51:23] us children
[51:26] parents will worship their
[51:29] children and sometimes we have
[51:32] parents even in the
[51:35] message that puts their children ahead
[51:38] of
[51:39] God Amen when it comes to a choice
[51:42] between the word of
[51:45] God what what the word of God
[51:48] says God wants and what their children
[51:52] wants sometimes they put put their
[51:55] children
[51:56] ahead and when they do that it
[51:59] displeases the Lord amen we must never
[52:03] put our children ahead of
[52:06] God we must not put our wives ahead of
[52:10] God must
[52:13] first now we could go deep into a lot of
[52:17] that which I'm sure that sometimes your
[52:20] pastor have shared those things with
[52:24] you but there something else I want to
[52:26] share with
[52:28] you that I never knew until this
[52:32] year and that is this amen when the
[52:36] Bible when the prophet tell
[52:39] us we must put God
[52:42] first put God
[52:45] first our family
[52:48] second
[52:50] last we must do that but when we had to
[52:54] put God second
[52:55] excuse me
[52:58] first there is some things that I found
[53:00] out this
[53:03] year I always
[53:06] thought that the problem with with the
[53:09] message or the word of
[53:12] God is people add or take
[53:16] away I always felt that way for many
[53:18] many
[53:20] years it's true there's a big problem
[53:23] with people I didn't take it away
[53:27] I discovered something this
[53:29] year I never knew
[53:32] before and that is sometimes people
[53:35] could take
[53:37] something that is
[53:39] scriptural it is
[53:41] scriptural and they put that
[53:44] first and they put God
[53:47] second let me show let me just show you
[53:50] a little example
[53:52] here as we go a little deeper into this
[53:56] now when Jesus spoke
[53:59] here in Mark
[54:02] 12 verse 29 and
[54:06] 31 amen the Bible says and Jesus
[54:10] answered
[54:12] him the first of all the
[54:15] Commandments is here oh
[54:18] Israel Lord our God is one
[54:22] Lord all right now we get into that and
[54:25] a little later if we have
[54:28] time and thou shall love the Lord thy
[54:31] God with all thy
[54:33] heart all th
[54:35] Soul all thy mind and with all thy
[54:39] strength this is the first
[54:42] commandment second is like namely
[54:46] this love thy neighbor as
[54:50] thyself loving your neighbor as
[54:54] yourself
[54:56] god require that we love one
[54:59] another that is the Bible if we don't
[55:02] love one another we displease
[55:05] God but when we put love for one another
[55:12] first God we
[55:15] have
[55:17] first first
[55:20] commandment second second so we kind of
[55:24] we kind of take the second and put it
[55:28] first keep the second
[55:32] second I I've heard people
[55:35] say I love so and so more than I love
[55:38] Jesus
[55:40] Christ to the word of
[55:42] God Jesus Christ must be
[55:47] first like I can
[55:49] say I love Israel I love your pastor
[55:54] here I love brother
[55:57] whisper
[55:59] friend I love brother
[56:01] Amando all of you but my love for God
[56:06] must be
[56:07] first I love my
[56:10] wife I love my children my God must be
[56:14] first because if I love my
[56:18] wife
[56:19] God made her an
[56:22] idol anything that you love more than
[56:28] ID and it is contrary to the program of
[56:32] god let's just let's go a little deeper
[56:35] into that
[56:37] tonight and Paul is speaking about
[56:40] this in First Corinthians chapter
[56:44] 13 now what Paul is talking about
[56:48] here it's scriptural
[56:51] things something contrary to the
[56:53] word take something that is
[56:57] scriptural god require of us to love our
[57:01] while god
[57:03] require children but that must be
[57:08] second does anybody
[57:11] understand now
[57:13] Paul speaking here in 1 Corinthians
[57:17] chapter
[57:20] 13 this is so wonderful
[57:23] amen as we go into
[57:26] in First Corinthians chapter
[57:29] 13 Paul says here do I speak with the
[57:33] tongues of men and of
[57:37] angels and have not
[57:39] charity I am become as a sounding brass
[57:42] or a tinkling
[57:45] symbol speaking in tongues is
[57:49] scriptural if somebody speaks in
[57:52] tongs it is not contrary to the word of
[57:56] God but the danger here is is when we go
[58:01] after speaking in
[58:05] tongues
[58:08] out tell
[58:09] us love here is the Holy
[58:13] Ghost that's why Jesus said seek
[58:20] first kingom of God
[58:23] his else will
[58:25] be so there are things that we have to
[58:28] put
[58:29] first amen even though it's a
[58:33] scriptural even though speaking in tongu
[58:35] is scriptural it must come
[58:39] second program of
[58:42] god let's just go a little further
[58:45] quickly amen just to bring a little
[58:48] examples
[58:49] here in 1 Corinthians 13 and though I
[58:52] have the gift of Prophecy
[58:57] and understand all
[59:00] Mysteries and all
[59:02] knowledge so understanding the
[59:06] Mysteries
[59:10] scriptural look if you want a scripture
[59:12] for
[59:14] it if you want a little scripture for
[59:18] it excuse me if we look at Matthew
[59:22] Chapter 13 I'm going to have to hurry
[59:23] here
[59:26] okay are you following
[59:29] me yeah
[59:31] here yeah in Matthew chap 13 and verse
[59:36] 11 Matthew 13 and verse
[59:44] 11 Jesus
[59:47] speaking and he says this I'm sorry I'm
[59:52] sorry I got Matthew I got the wrong
[59:53] scripture here yeah that's correct
[59:55] Matthew Chapter 13 and verse
[59:58] 11 Jesus speaking he answered and said
[1:00:01] unto them because it is given to you to
[1:00:03] know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[1:00:05] heaven but to them it is not
[1:00:11] given if we go up to verse
[1:00:14] 10 and the disciples came and said unto
[1:00:17] him why speakest thou unto them in
[1:00:22] par answered and said to them because it
[1:00:25] is given unto you to know the mysteries
[1:00:27] of the kingdom of heaven but to them it
[1:00:29] is not
[1:00:36] given to know the mysteries of
[1:00:41] godal but here is the danger even in the
[1:00:46] message when we go after the
[1:00:49] Mysteries and we leave God
[1:00:53] out that's the
[1:00:56] danger then we accumulate knowledge of
[1:00:58] the
[1:00:59] Mysteries and where is the spirit of God
[1:01:02] in our
[1:01:03] lives we must we must the kingdom of God
[1:01:09] first the kingdom of God is the Holy
[1:01:14] Ghost now Paul continues
[1:01:17] here Paul is warning
[1:01:20] us of the
[1:01:22] danger of going after something that is
[1:01:26] scriptural amen and neglecting
[1:01:30] God Amen what we have seen happen even
[1:01:34] around this
[1:01:36] message we are not saying it is not
[1:01:38] necessary to understand the
[1:01:40] M
[1:01:43] necessary
[1:01:44] scriptural and God wants us to have
[1:01:48] know that's why the seals were
[1:01:51] open when we go into the Mysteries
[1:01:55] and we don't we put that
[1:01:57] first we have made it an
[1:02:03] idol
[1:02:07] Wars does everybody see
[1:02:09] it let's go a little further
[1:02:14] now Paul
[1:02:16] continues he says and though I have all
[1:02:19] faith that I I could move
[1:02:22] mountains and have no charity I am
[1:02:27] nothing notice notice the language of
[1:02:30] the
[1:02:33] Bible notice the language of the
[1:02:36] Bible and though I
[1:02:39] had I have all
[1:02:42] faith I could move
[1:02:44] mountains this Faith
[1:02:47] here said it's your Fai it's the Fate
[1:02:52] you used to do things now what we are
[1:02:55] trying to do is not put emphasis upon
[1:02:58] what our faith can do but put the
[1:03:01] emphasis on what
[1:03:05] god
[1:03:06] father fill me with your
[1:03:09] faith and when God fills you with his
[1:03:12] faith faith is a revelation of the will
[1:03:16] of
[1:03:17] God you put the word of
[1:03:23] God
[1:03:25] but people run after the faithful
[1:03:28] Miracles praise God he heal me
[1:03:32] wonderful I prayed for a job and he give
[1:03:35] it to me
[1:03:37] wonderful my faith produced
[1:03:39] this produ that wonderful but Jesus said
[1:03:44] SE ye the kingdom of
[1:03:49] God it is
[1:03:51] scriptural for our faith to produce
[1:03:53] these things
[1:03:55] amen and God give you the faith the
[1:03:58] Bible says that
[1:04:00] every given the measure of
[1:04:02] Faith it's
[1:04:04] scriptural God give it to you but it has
[1:04:08] to be
[1:04:10] second God must be
[1:04:18] first all right now let's go a little
[1:04:21] further down
[1:04:23] now Paul continued to
[1:04:26] speak he says and though I bestow all my
[1:04:29] goods to feed the
[1:04:33] poor giving to the poor is
[1:04:39] scriptural what is wrong with giving to
[1:04:41] the
[1:04:43] poor but here is the
[1:04:46] problem what we give to the
[1:04:48] poor thinking in our
[1:04:51] minds that we will get all kind of
[1:04:53] spiritual benefit
[1:04:59] God
[1:05:03] out about
[1:05:09] that all
[1:05:11] right
[1:05:13] now then he goes
[1:05:15] on do I give my body to be
[1:05:20] burned even a m that gives his body to
[1:05:23] be burned
[1:05:26] and put God and don't put God
[1:05:29] first amen Paul warns us against
[1:05:34] it there's another
[1:05:36] thing where Christians puts God
[1:05:40] second and there is a danger with
[1:05:43] putting God
[1:05:45] second let me say this before I go into
[1:05:49] this do you
[1:05:51] remember that when Israel sinned against
[1:05:53] God
[1:05:56] that God told
[1:05:59] Moses to to build a brisen alar me a
[1:06:03] brisen
[1:06:05] serpent put it upon a
[1:06:08] pole and every one of the children of
[1:06:11] Israel that looked at the brisen
[1:06:16] altar what was it brother Bram tell us
[1:06:20] it was a gift of
[1:06:22] healing but where was the
[1:06:24] problem the children of
[1:06:26] Israel made an idol out of
[1:06:30] it was given by
[1:06:32] God Amen God told Moses to do
[1:06:35] it God can give you certain
[1:06:39] things
[1:06:40] things
[1:06:42] things
[1:06:44] come God must be
[1:06:47] first
[1:06:50] now uh let's go a little deeper
[1:06:55] okay and I'll read for you some things
[1:06:57] here
[1:06:59] quickly I trust this will be a
[1:07:02] blessing now here is what many
[1:07:05] Christians when you put God
[1:07:07] second and when I put God
[1:07:11] second there are consequences for
[1:07:18] it amen Excuse excuse me
[1:07:22] here there is Con quences for
[1:07:26] it and here's what brother brandham tell
[1:07:31] us here's the
[1:07:33] consequence he said now that is what I
[1:07:36] find among most Christian
[1:07:40] lives most I hate to say it's that
[1:07:45] way but it is true the most people that
[1:07:49] could profess
[1:07:52] Christianity they seem to have such a
[1:07:54] hard struggling time to hold
[1:08:00] on so you meet
[1:08:03] Christians and they have a hard
[1:08:07] time you hear them telling
[1:08:10] you it's a hard time for
[1:08:15] me hard for
[1:08:19] me I told the church back
[1:08:22] home according to this
[1:08:24] message things should be getting better
[1:08:27] for you and
[1:08:29] I to Jesus
[1:08:31] Christ he gives us more grace he gives
[1:08:35] us more
[1:08:36] Victory we grow in the
[1:08:39] lord it's better for us but the devil
[1:08:43] tells us it's
[1:08:44] worse don't listen to the
[1:08:48] devil Jesus said take my yoke upon you
[1:08:52] my yoke is easy
[1:08:54] burdens
[1:08:55] light but the devil tell you it's
[1:08:57] Grievious it's heavy don't listen to the
[1:09:01] devil put God
[1:09:05] first now brother brandham says
[1:09:10] here the most people that could profess
[1:09:16] Christianity they seem to have such a
[1:09:18] hard struggle in time to hold
[1:09:22] on
[1:09:24] I believe it's because of a lack of
[1:09:26] correct
[1:09:27] teaching
[1:09:29] the there's no such a thing as holding
[1:09:34] on holding
[1:09:36] on we have to
[1:09:38] stop and put the emphasis on
[1:09:42] ourselves that the devil would love for
[1:09:44] you to do he would love for me to do
[1:09:48] when our
[1:09:49] troubles and our
[1:09:51] trials and all happen in our
[1:09:54] lives becomes that that's the thing that
[1:09:57] we are occupied
[1:10:00] with amen we had this trial and that
[1:10:04] trouble this trial and that trouble and
[1:10:07] this trouble and that trouble and this
[1:10:10] what did the Bible tell us what did Paul
[1:10:13] tell us amen he said lay aside every
[1:10:17] weight R the race what does the bible
[1:10:20] tell us the burdens upon him
[1:10:24] we here tonight to cast the burdens upon
[1:10:29] Him brother listen my sister Jesus
[1:10:34] Christ is more important than any
[1:10:36] trouble you
[1:10:38] have Christ is more important than any
[1:10:41] trial you're going
[1:10:43] through all you have to do is put him in
[1:10:46] first
[1:10:49] place when you put the emphasis on
[1:10:52] yourself do this I got to do that I got
[1:10:56] to do this I got to do that then you
[1:11:00] find yourself
[1:11:01] struggling you're going up you're going
[1:11:04] down recognize it's not what I have to
[1:11:13] do then as the emphasis shifts upon
[1:11:19] Him amen then we can says Lord It's
[1:11:22] not then the
[1:11:25] trials seem to be so
[1:11:28] huge it's just like when they have this
[1:11:30] movie King
[1:11:31] Kong King Kong a big big
[1:11:36] monster told some little thing they use
[1:11:39] for that I heard it was some little
[1:11:41] thing they used for
[1:11:44] that have to dramatize
[1:11:48] things it's so hard for
[1:11:52] you hard
[1:11:54] poor you
[1:11:57] sister listen brother
[1:11:59] sister the Gospel of
[1:12:01] Jesus not sad news the Gospel of Jesus

[1:14:45] continues he says and
[1:14:47] now I find that people so
[1:14:52] struggle
[1:14:54] I meet people and they
[1:14:56] say just such a
[1:14:59] struggle have you seen people that
[1:15:02] way and probably there's many sitting
[1:15:05] before me
[1:15:06] now that that has their ups and
[1:15:09] downs ins and
[1:15:12] outs this day they all
[1:15:14] right you meet them they love the Lord
[1:15:19] today and tomorrow they're having such a
[1:15:21] struggle to hold on
[1:15:24] the devil is so tempting him and up and
[1:15:29] down then you meet
[1:15:31] somebody that's H up all the
[1:15:35] time brother
[1:15:38] listen you get up on those
[1:15:41] hilltops there may be little dips in the
[1:15:44] hilltops but you still on the
[1:15:47] hilltop you can rejoice in
[1:15:50] God why because you
[1:15:57] [Applause]
[1:16:05] on because he said cast all
[1:16:12] your and then and then you're putting
[1:16:17] God
[1:16:18] first because when Israel did
[1:16:21] that they worship the idol
[1:16:24] God had to tell
[1:16:27] heahy that thing and praise
[1:16:31] God any Idol if you if you a true child
[1:16:35] of
[1:16:36] God
[1:16:38] Idol life that you are put in ahead of
[1:16:41] God you thinking thinking thinking about
[1:16:45] that when your thoughts be on Jesus
[1:16:48] Christ word and his Blessing you all in
[1:16:54] that then God has to put on and destroy
[1:16:57] the whole
[1:16:58] thing why because it's contary to
[1:17:04] God
[1:17:06] now when we put him
[1:17:11] first when we come now to put him
[1:17:15] first we said Lord I'm putting aside
[1:17:20] everything your will
[1:17:23] your
[1:17:24] love you let me share two things with
[1:17:27] you quickly before I
[1:17:30] finish brother Bram you hear you brother
[1:17:33] Bram told
[1:17:35] us he said my
[1:17:38] Ministry is to try to unite Brothers
[1:17:43] together is that contrary to the
[1:17:48] word amen if I'm here
[1:17:51] tonight I'm trying to unite the churches
[1:17:55] together I can unite Brothers together I
[1:17:58] am absolutely in the will of
[1:18:01] God but when we speak about the
[1:18:06] unity W
[1:18:08] us Unity with
[1:18:10] God United with God must be
[1:18:15] first and it is far more
[1:18:18] important the unity of Brothers
[1:18:21] together when we put the unity of the
[1:18:24] Brethren
[1:18:27] first like like David D
[1:18:31] did we move away from God it is a
[1:18:35] scriptural
[1:18:36] thing and it is good and it is according
[1:18:40] to God's
[1:18:41] program not come ahead of the
[1:18:47] unity amen God must be
[1:18:51] first because when we put that ahead of
[1:18:55] God then we will compromise
[1:18:59] Unity
[1:19:02] compromise to
[1:19:06] God now let
[1:19:09] me let me just read one or two one or
[1:19:13] two quotes quick quick quick quick quick
[1:19:15] on
[1:19:17] that because I see it
[1:19:19] coming I see doing it listen brother
[1:19:24] sister your friendship with
[1:19:28] anybody must not come ahead of
[1:19:31] God don't let your
[1:19:38] friendship
[1:19:40] [Applause]
[1:19:46] word let me let me read it for
[1:19:50] you okay
[1:19:54] I want
[1:19:56] Unity it's
[1:19:58] scriptural and we must have
[1:20:06] it I'll read it for
[1:20:10] you in the message
[1:20:12] here God's providing place of
[1:20:17] worship let me read for you one or two
[1:20:21] quickly take five more minutes
[1:20:27] time all the churches come
[1:20:30] together it's going to be a world Cil
[1:20:33] churches and Jesus prayed for that that
[1:20:36] we all might be
[1:20:39] one but now you see that is caral minded
[1:20:43] without knowing the
[1:20:47] spirit Jesus said that there might be
[1:20:51] one father
[1:20:53] as you and I are
[1:20:58] one then he goes on to say
[1:21:02] here it says
[1:21:04] here but that you might be one with
[1:21:09] God like Christ and God was
[1:21:12] one that's what the prayer
[1:21:15] is that was the word that Jesus
[1:21:18] prayed that we might be the
[1:21:21] word reflecting
[1:21:24] him that's his prayer to be
[1:21:27] answered see how Satan scles us up in
[1:21:30] the caral
[1:21:32] mind but that wasn't Jesus per at
[1:21:36] all that we might all congregate
[1:21:39] together and have a certain Creed and so
[1:21:42] forth every time they do it they go
[1:21:46] further and further from
[1:21:48] God he wants us to be one with
[1:21:51] God God is the word each
[1:21:55] individual in his heart must be that one
[1:21:59] with
[1:21:59] God so the unity is the unity of
[1:22:06] God you and I putting him
[1:22:11] first in all
[1:22:16] things and when he is put
[1:22:19] first then the Bible says and the
[1:22:23] message says he has gotten the
[1:22:26] preeminence that word
[1:22:28] preeminence means give him the first
[1:22:32] place he is the first of all
[1:22:35] things he is the first in our
[1:22:38] Liv not our troubles and
[1:22:41] trials not our good
[1:22:44] works no gifts or manifestation
[1:22:48] of God for all of that Jes Christ must
[1:22:52] be
[1:22:56] one more quote and I'll finish
[1:22:59] here as we put him
[1:23:02] first brother brandham tells us
[1:23:05] this in Gabriel's instruction to
[1:23:10] Daniel he says and
[1:23:13] God and God never did deal with Israel
[1:23:16] till she come back to her
[1:23:21] Homeland he
[1:23:24] thus say the
[1:23:27] Lord God will not deal with his
[1:23:31] church until she comes back to the
[1:23:34] home the message of the
[1:23:37] hour so if we want
[1:23:40] God bless us amen we want God to bless
[1:23:46] our
[1:23:47] churches bless our
[1:23:49] ministry bless what we are
[1:23:51] doing must to that message of the
[1:23:56] hour when people deviate from
[1:24:00] the they keep the
[1:24:03] knowledge is not with
[1:24:10] them so as I
[1:24:13] finish we could take
[1:24:16] things that is
[1:24:19] scriptural and that God has ordained for
[1:24:22] us
[1:24:26] no true
[1:24:28] Christian is against Unity with one
[1:24:32] another
[1:24:34] scriptural friendship is
[1:24:37] scriptural but when these things come
[1:24:41] ahead of
[1:24:42] God we have made an idol out of
[1:24:45] it though it was given by God and that
[1:24:49] displeases the
[1:24:51] Lord and the result is a struggle in our
[1:24:55] lives there is no peace amen we can't
[1:24:59] relax
[1:25:01] in
[1:25:06] Eno enjoy
[1:25:09] thejoy our
[1:25:12] prayer rejoice in the
[1:25:16] Lord a
[1:25:18] struggle battle
[1:25:21] and
[1:25:23] because
[1:25:29] God but when we put all these
[1:25:33] things second must be
[1:25:36] second first must be
[1:25:38] first he said father I will see your
