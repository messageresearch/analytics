[35:35] [Music]
[35:39] foreign
[35:49] ers
[35:53] we reached that point in service to
[35:55] introduce some speakers
[35:59] [Music]
[36:01] very special speakers
[36:04] our first Speaker today was actually our
[36:06] precious brother Mateo Alvarado and Mr
[36:09] primero De Los Angeles
[36:21] um
[36:23] can we read Acts 2 38
[36:30] then Peter said unto them repent and be
[36:34] baptized every one of you in the name of
[36:37] Jesus Christ for the rementions of sins
[36:41] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[36:44] Holy Ghost
[36:47] and then John 3 5 Jesus answered verily
[36:52] verily I say unto thee except a man be
[36:55] born of water and this of the spirit he
[36:59] cannot enter into the kingdom of God
[37:04] now the first time baptism was ever
[37:08] spoke of was spoke of by John the
[37:13] Baptist
[37:14] how many knows that to be true
[37:18] all right I'm going to lay it over here
[37:22] way over here
[37:24] John the Baptist
[37:27] and John
[37:29] baptized the people in the river of
[37:33] Jordan
[37:33] commanding them that they should repaint
[37:37] and get right with God and sell their
[37:42] goods and feed the poor and the soldiers
[37:47] be satisfied with their money and to get
[37:52] right with God
[37:54] how many knows that
[37:56] and then he baptized them in the river
[38:01] of Jordan not sprinkled them not poor
[38:07] them but
[38:12] if you don't believe it here's the let's
[38:17] just come
[38:19] find out if it isn't that
[38:24] baptism which is
[38:27] baptized immersed
[38:30] [Music]
[38:32] put under buried now the first time
[38:36] baptism was ever spoke of was there the
[38:42] second time baptism was ever spoke
[38:45] in of Jesus Jesus
[38:49] commissioned it Matthew 28 19.
[38:56] next time
[38:58] baptism was spoke of was Acts 2 38.
[39:05] now if we can find out what kind of
[39:10] now remember this is just 33 years after
[39:15] the
[39:17] inauguration of the church at Pentecost
[39:22] 33 years later there has been such a
[39:27] Falling Away unto Jude here under the
[39:31] inspiration of the holy spirit is
[39:35] sending the letter to the churches to
[39:40] earnestly
[39:42] content for the faith that was once
[39:46] delivered to the Saints now if we can
[39:50] only find out what kind of a faith
[39:54] the first Saints had then we can find
[39:59] out what kind of Faith to contend for is
[40:03] that right
[40:04] but we must remember what kind of Faith
[40:09] was it
[40:10] now let's just think about
[40:13] oh well the first thing a person
[40:18] ought to do is think of the first
[40:21] subject
[40:22] the first thing that we must do is to
[40:26] repent the disciples taught repentance
[40:30] water baptism Divine Healing
[40:35] resurrection of the Dead
[40:38] Madness man if it came soon of the power
[40:43] of the Holy Ghost
[40:45] signs and wonders spoke with tongues
[40:48] interpreted interpret tongues cast out
[40:53] Devils healed the sick open the blinded
[40:57] eyes saw Visions is that right well this
[41:02] is
[41:03] 1900 years
[41:06] and we're still contending
[41:09] for the faith that was once delivered to
[41:13] the Saints and God is confirming it
[41:20] water baptism does not save you as much
[41:25] as people's sometimes think it does
[41:29] water baptism is a calm and moration of
[41:35] the death burial and
[41:39] resurrection of the Lord it does not
[41:42] save you
[41:45] there
[41:46] there's only one baptism that's the Holy
[41:50] Spirit baptism there's water is only a
[41:54] type God bless you
[41:58] thank you
[41:58] [Applause]
[42:08] God bless you thank you brother Matthew
[42:10] for speaking
[42:12] um
[42:15] now to our next special speaker
[42:18] our precious brother brother Leo Robles
[42:21] Robles
[42:33] and crucial yeah best thing you could do
[42:41] Mr makes you a new person
[42:43] if you could please turn to Mark chapter
[42:45] 8 verse 35
[42:51] and says for whosoever will save his
[42:54] life shall lose it but whoever shall
[42:57] lose his life for my sake and the
[43:00] gospels the same shall save it by being
[43:03] born again you plant yourself in the
[43:06] correct spot with this you can grow to
[43:09] be a son of God
[43:14] let's say for example Kane he was
[43:17] religious had his own church and seemed
[43:20] like the son of God
[43:21] but in reality he never really cleansed
[43:24] all the all the bad stuff
[43:27] we need to have that personal connection
[43:29] I'd also like to turn to the scripture
[43:32] John chapter 3 verse 3 to 5.
[43:39] it says Jesus answered and said unto him
[43:43] verily verily I say unto thee except a
[43:47] man be born again he cannot see the
[43:50] kingdom of God
[43:51] nicodemia is saith unto him how can a
[43:54] man be born again
[43:56] when he is old can he enter the second
[44:00] time into his mother's womb and be born
[44:03] Jesus answered verily verily I say unto
[44:07] thee except a man of water and of spirit
[44:09] he cannot enter the kingdom of God
[44:13] and the importance of being born again
[44:15] we replenish the soul and give to God
[44:19] once this happens we act and behave
[44:22] differently not only do we not do our
[44:26] old decisions
[44:27] or habits but we now see them as a sin
[44:31] and a wrong decision
[44:33] brother Branham says that you must be
[44:36] born again
[44:38] our old self dies and we are born again
[44:41] once we are fully cleansed there is a
[44:44] change in nature from our mental and
[44:46] physical bodies may have a wonderful
[44:49] evening God bless you
[44:55] [Applause]
[45:04] God bless you brother thank you brother
[45:06] uh Leo for speaking is
[45:11] now we actually have one more special
[45:13] speaker
[45:15] and now it's not me
[45:19] but before this uh this brother comes up
[45:23] I would like to read some scriptures
[45:26] now I brought my sword
[45:29] I hope you brought yours is
[45:42] can you please turn to the Book of
[45:44] Exodus Exodus
[45:47] chapter four capitulo cuatro
[45:57] chapter four the very first verse on
[46:05] and Moses answered
[46:07] and said believe me
[46:09] nor hearken onto any voice for they will
[46:13] say the Lord have not appeared unto thee
[46:15] is
[46:25] and the Lord said unto him what is that
[46:27] in thy hand
[46:29] and he said a rod
[46:31] is
[46:36] and he said cast it on onto the ground
[46:39] and he casted on the ground and he
[46:41] became a serpent and Moses fled from
[46:44] before it is
[46:52] hey man let's go ahead and pray amen
[46:55] please buy your heads
[46:59] Lord Heavenly fathers
[47:00] Lord and now is the time to hear a
[47:04] brother Speak
[47:07] Lord I asked you to open the ears
[47:10] everyone here
[47:13] open the hearts
[47:16] so whatever the brother is is
[47:19] trying to say
[47:22] may he impact everyone here
[47:27] Lord asks you to bless him Lord
[47:33] the name of Jesus Christ
[47:35] amen amen
[47:38] now I'd like to introduce our brother
[47:39] Moses
[47:54] if you don't know who I am my name is
[47:56] Moses
[47:58] I have a question for the Children First
[48:01] okay
[48:02] who likes my rod
[48:05] it's a really nice Rod right
[48:08] I said let my people go
[48:11] wait this is the wrong one I'm sorry I'm
[48:13] sorry
[48:14] I just went fishing sorry let my people
[48:18] go
[48:19] this is my rod
[48:21] do you like my rod
[48:24] well I want to tell you a little story
[48:28] that there was one time
[48:31] that God wanted his people out of
[48:34] slavery
[48:36] they were
[48:37] in the land of Egypt
[48:40] they were enslaved by I said oh
[48:43] look at the stick
[48:45] I said I'm not going to be an Egyptian
[48:47] no more
[48:48] I'm not going to be the greatest in
[48:50] Egypt I'm just going to be a shepherd
[48:54] so I took this old dry stick
[48:56] it didn't mean anything maybe it came
[48:59] from an olive tree
[49:03] or some other kind of Branch but I took
[49:06] it
[49:07] and I became a shepherd
[49:11] and sometimes I would have to have to
[49:13] hit my sheep sometimes I had to guide
[49:15] them nice and gently
[49:18] but that's what I did with this other
[49:20] burning bush
[49:21] this Burning Bush wasn't being consumed
[49:24] by the fire
[49:26] oh
[49:31] okay
[49:33] and I said yes Lord
[49:36] he said I forgot even how to talk all I
[49:38] talked to was sheep slams some Sometimes
[49:42] some goats
[49:44] but that's all that was my language
[49:47] that was my language I said Lord I can't
[49:49] speak and if I do go over there they're
[49:52] not going to believe me
[49:53] I was scared
[49:55] I wasn't I Was 80 years old I was scared
[49:59] I said they're not going to believe me
[50:01] Lord
[50:02] they're not going to listen they're not
[50:04] going to think that God is with me
[50:07] and God he turned to me and he said what
[50:10] is in your hand
[50:12] he said Lord
[50:14] it's just my dry old stick
[50:17] it's just my rod
[50:19] I use it for the the Sheep I use it for
[50:22] walking I'm getting a little old Lord
[50:25] he said cast it on the ground
[50:28] casted it on the ground and it became a
[50:30] snake
[50:31] can you believe that
[50:33] it became a snake and I I got so scared
[50:36] I began to run from it and God says go
[50:38] and pick it up from the tail
[50:41] now if anybody has handled snakes I've
[50:43] handled many
[50:45] you don't pick a snake up from the tail
[50:49] no it's just gonna bite you it's going
[50:51] to turn around and bite you you have to
[50:52] grab it from the head but God says pick
[50:54] it up from the tail
[50:56] picked it up from the tail and it became
[50:58] my staff again
[51:00] and he said with this
[51:02] broth
[51:04] with this stick
[51:06] you are going to do Mighty wonders
[51:11] is that what this difference
[51:14] this stick insignificant stick
[51:17] I was I was about to switch it it's
[51:19] getting a little old
[51:22] but he said with this one
[51:25] when you stretch forth your hands
[51:28] great wonders are going to come forth
[51:32] I said yes Lord I'll do it
[51:34] yes I will go
[51:36] I grabbed my wife I grabbed my two kids
[51:38] and I was saddled up on a donkey
[51:42] people began to laugh and say what are
[51:44] you doing are you a one-man Invasion
[51:45] going to a greatest country in the world
[51:48] I said yes
[51:50] I am going to go and conquer the
[51:53] greatest nation that there was at that
[51:55] time
[51:58] wow
[51:59] but I was confident
[52:01] because I knew God was with me and he
[52:04] said
[52:04] that with this Rod he was going to do
[52:07] his mighty wonders
[52:09] and I went I believed him and sure
[52:13] enough I went to pharaoh and I said let
[52:15] my people go
[52:17] Pharaoh said no
[52:19] he said okay
[52:21] and he I went to the waters I put my
[52:24] staff in the waters and the waters
[52:26] turned all into blood
[52:29] I said wow this power in the stick
[52:34] the Pharaoh still didn't take him
[52:37] still didn't want to lose them I said
[52:39] let my people go he said no with my
[52:42] stick I called up frogs
[52:45] let my people go he said no I put my
[52:48] stick in the sand in boils and lice and
[52:52] all those things came forward
[52:54] until the power of God broke the kingdom
[52:59] the nation of Egypt
[53:03] with this little old stick
[53:06] said what a mighty stick but it wasn't
[53:09] the stick brother
[53:11] see you want to hold it
[53:14] it's just a regular stick
[53:17] but what the stick represented
[53:21] what this stick represented
[53:23] was the power of God
[53:26] that the power of God was with me
[53:31] and believe it or not I know your guys's
[53:33] prophet
[53:35] your Prophet is named William Miriam
[53:38] Brown
[53:40] and I heard him once and I heard him say
[53:44] that The Stick of Moses the rod the
[53:48] staff
[53:51] whatever you want to call it
[53:53] he said this old stick
[53:56] is the name of Jesus for us
[54:00] think about it
[54:02] you guys have a stick here today
[54:06] and it is the name of Jesus Christ
[54:10] and you can go wherever you want
[54:13] holding your stick holding that power
[54:16] that Authority
[54:18] which is the name of Jesus Christ
[54:22] Wherever You Go kids you go to school
[54:25] you go to your friends
[54:27] you go to church take the name of Jesus
[54:30] with you
[54:32] brother Branham I remember him saying if
[54:35] Moses let go of this stick and the
[54:37] Egyptians would have took it from them
[54:39] they would have had all of Israel
[54:41] whipped
[54:43] beaten
[54:45] because they took the authority away
[54:50] brother Branham says if he ever the
[54:52] devil ever takes the name of Jesus from
[54:55] the churches
[54:57] converts it to titles or whatever you
[54:59] want to call it
[55:01] he has the church whipped
[55:04] if you don't understand
[55:07] the power in the name of Jesus
[55:10] then we won't use it
[55:13] we hear many people they say the name of
[55:16] Jesus in vain they say oh Jesus but
[55:23] there's many people called Jesus I'm
[55:26] sure we have two three four five people
[55:28] in here named Jesus
[55:30] hi Jesus hi Jesus Wherever You Are
[55:34] but the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[55:37] has power
[55:39] why
[55:40] because God
[55:43] all of God and all of his power
[55:47] every name that he had in the Old
[55:49] Testament is boiled down to that man
[55:52] named Jesus Christ
[55:55] Jesus was the one he was the one that
[55:58] paid your price
[56:00] when we didn't have no Authority we
[56:03] didn't have no power
[56:05] Jesus died for us
[56:07] and he took all the power in his name in
[56:10] his person and now he says in the name
[56:14] of Jesus
[56:15] you can cast out devils
[56:17] in the name of Jesus you can be healed
[56:20] sorry my beard is falling off don't pay
[56:22] attention to it please
[56:25] in the name of Jesus
[56:29] people can be healed
[56:31] in the name of Jesus God can help you
[56:34] with your schoolwork
[56:36] in the name of Jesus God can help you
[56:38] with the bully
[56:40] in the name of Jesus God can help you
[56:43] with whatever you need
[56:46] any trial any problem in the name of the
[56:50] Lord Jesus Christ
[56:53] it has so much power the Bible says all
[56:56] knees shall bow at the name of Jesus
[57:00] he says you pray in my name and you'll
[57:03] see mountains move
[57:04] wow
[57:06] for you guys
[57:08] you can hold the name of Jesus with you
[57:12] that's yours
[57:14] you can hold the name of Jesus sister
[57:17] that's yours
[57:20] the name of Jesus is for you
[57:23] pass it to your buddy you're there
[57:25] the name of Jesus and for anybody that
[57:28] has courage to hold it
[57:30] and don't let it go
[57:33] don't let anything
[57:35] make you drop that name of Jesus
[57:39] you will hold it and as brother Matthew
[57:41] was saying you are baptized in the name
[57:45] of Jesus that's why we are baptized in
[57:48] the name of Jesus because as it has
[57:50] Power and Jesus Christ promised that he
[57:54] will descend down and live in your heart
[57:57] if you're baptized When you pray what's
[58:00] the last thing you say when after you
[58:03] pray
[58:04] okay amen
[58:06] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I
[58:08] pray
[58:10] amen
[58:12] why because we want to finish every
[58:15] prayer everything that we do in the name
[58:18] of Jesus
[58:20] why because there's a person behind us
[58:23] saying I'll go with you
[58:25] take this Rod take this name
[58:28] and I'll go and you'll conquer Nations
[58:32] you'll conquer your sickness you'll
[58:33] conquer your habits you'll conquer
[58:35] everything you have in front of you
[58:39] people might laugh
[58:40] people might say you're crazy
[58:42] it doesn't matter
[58:44] take the name of Jesus with you
[58:47] breathe that holy name in prayer
[58:50] and you'll see miracles happen
[58:52] believe it who believes it I want to see
[58:55] Hands today
[58:56] oh my goodness
[58:58] how can we not believe it
[59:01] we've seen many miracles in the name of
[59:04] Jesus
[59:05] that name of Jesus many people are named
[59:07] Jesus but the name of the Lord Jesus
[59:10] Christ holds all of God's power in that
[59:14] name and God's word is in that name it
[59:17] represents his word
[59:20] so take his name you're taking his word
[59:24] that's all I wanted to say I wanted to
[59:26] give you a little testimony of my rock
[59:29] and let you know that each and every one
[59:31] of you
[59:32] have this same Rock
[59:35] if I could say you have something
[59:36] greater
[59:38] you have the name of God
[59:42] and you have it at your disposal not to
[59:45] say it in the in vain not to say it just
[59:49] to say it but say it with reverence say
[59:52] it with with sincerity
[59:54] and you will see the Miracles you will
[59:57] see things happen in your life
[1:00:01] amen
[1:00:03] can I hear everybody say Jesus
[1:00:07] that's power
[1:00:09] that's power and you have it for
[1:00:11] yourself
[1:00:12] that's all I wanted to say
[1:00:15] after this I'm going to be leaving
[1:00:18] I'm going to take my fishing rod because
[1:00:19] I don't want anybody to take it
[1:00:24] and we're going to have a newscast from

[1:01:43] where all the delicious meals are made
[1:01:45] standing here it's hard to think that
[1:01:48] not too long ago our church didn't have
[1:01:51] a place together much less to cook now
[1:01:54] with all the prayers and hard work our
[1:01:57] brothers and sisters have this updated
[1:02:01] commercial kitchen with a six
[1:02:05] gas burner stove
[1:02:07] and

[1:02:13] stainless sink
[1:02:16] with all these open space and open
[1:02:20] cabinets are Master Chef Lupita will
[1:02:24] have an easier time working in the
[1:02:27] kitchen
[1:02:29] back to you
[1:02:36] 'll find this here tonight in this
[1:02:39] wonderful parking lot of our church
[1:02:42] nicely redone beautiful
[1:02:44] and lovely thanks to all the brothers
[1:02:46] and the hard work that they've been
[1:02:48] doing and everything let me give you a
[1:02:50] little tour
[1:02:51] and what it's been doing around here
[1:02:53] so first off we'll start by the wall
[1:02:57] before it was all old and decrepit
[1:03:01] following day
[1:03:02] part and messed up
[1:03:04] then we pulled in some asphalt and made
[1:03:08] some more parking area even lined it out
[1:03:10] so people can see where the park and how
[1:03:12] to park
[1:03:13] and then down the center here you'll see
[1:03:15] these solar lights how they light up
[1:03:18] with the sun and looks so beautiful with
[1:03:21] all the energy it comes down from there
[1:03:24] and if you look way towards the back
[1:03:25] you'll see a real little parking lot
[1:03:28] where there's a basketball court a
[1:03:30] soccer court and a volleyball court and
[1:03:33] since we have put in this asphalt it has
[1:03:35] lowered our Energies
[1:03:38] not so many boogers coming up our noses
[1:03:42] but with all this we want to thank God
[1:03:45] for all the opportunities that you have
[1:03:47] given us
[1:03:48] and how he has provided for our church
[1:03:50] and everything
