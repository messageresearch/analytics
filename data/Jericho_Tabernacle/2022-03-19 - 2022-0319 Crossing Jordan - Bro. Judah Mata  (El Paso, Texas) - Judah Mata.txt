cardinal brother spoke last night our brother judah mata is going to bring the words we're gonna pray for him and the lord anoint him with the holy spirit [Music] and they come here to preach the word for us tonight are you in the spirit standing in the spirit are you warm up now yeah hey why don't you give a tap offering to the lord [Applause] [Music] who established his church [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and my mother just made some tortillas and some beans i said i'm sorry i only have beans and then the we want to get into the word if we can go to the book of joshua josue to the first chapter verse one and we'll read verse one through three now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord speak unto joshua the son of nun moses is minister saying moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this jordan thou and all this people unto the land which i do give unto them even to the children of israel and every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that i will give unto you as i said unto moses lord first of all for this precious group of brethren we have before us and that tonight we may be able to tread upon that promised land that is our prayer this evening we ask it in the name of the lord jesus christ amen [Music] [Music] and today we want to learn from a young one one person who in their youth [Music] he was able to do things that others in their old age were never able to do el podo relisados now we know that joshua he came out of egypt along with moses and one of the things that really set him apart is that he had his eye on the promised land and he never moved his focus from that yeah [Applause] because by this time the lord has now uh stopped dealing with moses he says as he talks to him he says be strong and have a good courage he says but in english it says to push yourself to strive so that word is fuersa so the word strive if if we could go to english we'll have many meanings one would be try your best give an extra effort now if you see the word in spanish it's composed of two words which is strengthen yourself strengthen yourself especially in other words here the lord is telling joshua you're not a baby anymore i'm not gonna go and push you you're not i don't have to go and strengthen you you know if you want to or not whether you like it or not i command you to be strong of good courage see give the extra miles [Music] vamos a verona i don't know about how i don't know these people on the bible and these these other things you know about marvel marvel oh they know all the characters you know their powers uh they know their backstory they know and what movie they came out what this what that he tells him this he says this book of the law is shall it not depart out of thy mouth but that shall of the people from israel i'd like to read a quote from the brand in the message questions and answers it says they left egypt they came through the other side rejoicing and praising god and they went and got the laws and from there one to the promised land of uh and moses stretched forth his hand over the sea and the lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night and made the sea dry land and the waters were divided oriental and with a blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together the flood stood upright as i keep and the depths were congealed in the heart of the scene when we see the movie all these people they're there [Applause] that he congealed the waters in other words another word for congeal he froze them oh what were those waters aguas that was the world the world to them was no longer a warm place but then the world was not a pleasant place it was a cold place see they left the things of the world let's say like this cold turkey at all completely so youth no we're not even we haven't even gotten to the message yet because it's crossing jordan but before you can even get to jordan you gotta have a baptism and i'm [Music] it's not it's gotta be either wet or dry no god don't want no cold or hot caliente he wants either choose a side el que so now this we see that when this happens if we go to the numbers 21-4 to compass the land of edom and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way. and the people speak against god and against moses therefore have you brought us up out of the land out of egypt to die in the wilderness is there no bread neither water niagara look at look at what we just read by the way of the red sea por el camino del mar they just saw this tremendous miracle if we could say it like this [Music] hard have you brought us out here to die there's no bread noi there's no water no agua is this in that yes didn't you just see the power of god if you keep reading it says and the lord said fiery serpents amongst the people and we know the serpents beat the people and they still keep on doing what they're going to do oh yeah you're baptized oh you're free is libre but what about up here they still have the same old mind of a slave mentality oh yeah i don't drink no more oh i don't do drugs no more no consume oh that's good brother you think you're an overcomer because of that that's nothing no no overcome this no drinking whatever all those things that's easy but overcome this you come into the into the feet of the lord you're in church now maybe if you don't die to yourself those feelings are going to proceed but you know what happens now instead of going out to the bar to drink i'm going with the sisters hermanos and i'm going to go talk bad about this other sister oh you know what now i'm going to do this it's the same spirit but now it's worse [Music] we see that in exodus 32 and exodus we see that then the peep that moses goes up into the mountain he goes up to receive the commandments of the lord but he's delayed and he's there for 40 days and the peoples are saying well this moses is probably dead in one of the uh el pollo and comments have they not seen the miracles has got not fed oh yeah we still believe in god i i don't want to be under the responsibility of some pastor i'd rather be on my own and i go with the calf i do what i want now this golden calf is my god now why what i always ask myself why a cat there's a reason behind it did you know that uh uh there's periods of time in the in the skies but during that time durant the sign in the stars was taurus so what did they say it was look at the sky oh oh it does matter who is guiding you see moses was the guy see god said they're your people you're responsible for them and then moses speaks and he tells him he says and moses and moses besought the lord his god and said lord why doest thou wrath what wrath hot what against thy people which thou hath brought forth out of the land of egypt with great power and with a mighty hand [Music] to we need to reach that maturity tenemos to where we cannot judge but extend grace stand on the bridge this young man he stayed with the ministry ministries where god was working we know that time goes on that then they go to the river jordan and moses then has the twelve spies and then they come back we know then only joshua and caleb gave the good reports they said we can do it and everyone else said no we can't joshua and caleb die to yourself and the one with the father he said we have a living example we have a joshua that brought us the evidence [Applause] and everyone else died oh the beauty what what a wonderful brethren they were they were baptized they died with the same mentality they had when they were slaves isn't there something wrong with that now in if you see a 40 year old man that's it mommy i still want a diaper and a bottle um you see a 50 year old man this is [Music] they die like big babies they were never able to cross over jordan they were never able to surpass the mind or the mentality of a slave mentality but this young man he was a slave el fuest but he was able to have a transformation of his mind there's a key right there he was able to keep his focus on the [Music] and we know as we read in the in the beginning the lord then started to deal with joshua when it's time to cross over yeah what was the first thing that they crossed over was it joshua no no they said it says the priest bearing the ark of the covenant before the people wow it says and the priests that bear the ark were dipped in the brim of the water if we go to the quote in the message israel and the church he says and he looked down through with angry eyes and he said when he did the red sea got scared and began one of these days you're going to try to follow that holy ghost band and you'll find out your wheels you said i yeah well come from the same mentality of the wilderness from the same mentality of the red sea mentality you've got to cross on dry land you have to see the people were slaves there were slaves to the world they were slaves to the devil diablo but you know what now he by this fall he has took over and possessed the garden of eden himself and he took it over and now he has six thousand years of deceitful rule because they were based on free moral agencies to act any way they wish so people today they think he used and they have rights they think that they're doing what they want to do but it's a deceitful rule when you do your will as long as you keep doing what you think is right all you're going to do is make a bunch of mud because all you're going to do is going to try to mix your mentality [Music] and we want to cross jordan now yeah it is now as though the people cross over something happened while they're in the wilderness el senor los mis he would give them food he would give them meat he would give them water agua their shoes would grow along with their feet their uh would grow with them it wouldn't tear no oh they had a pillar of fire that would cap over them in the night i'm not gonna grab you like a baby [Music] we need that god in us oh we need a living god but not the god of only of heaven not just the god of moses but you need a living but were they filled with it there's a difference exist we can go to church we can feel the presence of the lord and say glory be to god but what happens on monday what happens the rest of the week is the is the cloud not in here is the presence of god not in here he did the best he could it says there that while joshua lived they were under the rule of joshua they were true to the lord if we go away in the book of second kings they come to the same river jordan and you know what elijah does takes off his mantle now what's a mantle it's a piece of clothing it's rupa it's they call it a dress square he took his dress where el tomoso says he folded it and when he crossed to the other side he found himself in a rapture now youth we're waiting for that rapture who wants to be in that rapture well here elijah gave us the key elias if we could read in the message putting on the whole armor of god says now god's fortifying his army with what conquest what was god doing listen did you ever think a caso pencil what that office of the church is officious it's god's dress [Applause] [Music] is god's dress elijah took the dress where elias he took the the clothing that was covering god and he smoked the waters and he walked on dry land oh yes with my brothers and sisters there is a ministry ministerial that has that mantle there is a ministry ministerial that speaks of clean gospel there is a message that brother bernie preached [Music] of what god is telling us through that mask through that dress but you know what we do but we look at god what we need to hear the word of god and we see here that when when elijah smote the waters he went up into the rapture and alicia yeliseo he asked for a double portion and he received the same mantle and he came to the waters and he said where's is but now we're in the book of matthew matteo matthew 3 mateo and it says there if you say then cometh jesus untogether lead to jordan he began his ministry el comenzo ministerio by coming to jordan he himself el mismo he died to all his rights and he then took on what god asked of him we know then there as the scripture continues when he is baptized the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him a voice from heaven um jesus was baptized in jordan jesus because there the lord separated from him so that then he could die as a man oh the everlasting eternal god the god i am sending them into the world i am praying not yo no only for these disciples but also look at this brother for all who will ever okay believe in me and creating me through their message i pray that they will be one so they may be one [Music] that the world will know that you sent me and that you loved them as much as you loved me a secret we have the same experience i want to read a quote brother branagh in the in the in the church each book in the pergaming church notice the harmony of the father and the son harmony jesus never did anything jesus until it was first shown him by the father john 5 19 and juan cinco di estar is now to exist aura kicks between the groom entre el novio and his bride is he shows her el moistra in his words of life she raise it up again here is the secret of this look at what brother branham is telling us the secret of this is the word what was the problem with the people of israel they had the same mind from before the antis but here brother branham is telling us the bride is for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the lord [Music] we can then become we keep reading like the seed that is planted and watered up it comes to full harvest we must they only speak what is thus saith the lord that is so hard to do is because we have so many things to say but he says if the lord does not say anything [Music] for it was not yet time for him to do certain things which he left for this specific time in particular there is where you and i come in we are not just any people we are a special people because that's when you're most alive it's when what am god will work with his creature this is the way he's made him you don't have to figure it out works with his creature in the way it's good to pray for healing if you need deliverance it's good to pray for that but you know what you can get sick the next day you know what a week later you can be in bondage again you can have then all these blessings the people of israel had them in the wilderness but they missed that key ingredient to have the mind of christ to be one with him he said to be filled with his holy ghost not anointed until i [Music] brother branham says this and i'm finishing decent amount of remember but your real altar is where god has met you and he has met you yes where your city lord heavenly father face the giants that they can look back and just like joshua and say yes we can do it for see you thinking them people lord that they have such an experience be their anchor lord our youth need of a mighty anchor in this time senor nostros [Music] our our giants are all these things we inhabit inside [Music] anything that hinders the father the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] don't delay [Music] [Music] even now [Music] [Music] is just [Music] is [Music] [Music] uh [Music] is [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] and my mind is [Music] i can't explain it must be gone here in my soul
