[29:37] [Music]
[29:46] in the precious name of the lord jesus
[29:48] christ amen amen
[29:55] and just as we're standing if you can
[29:57] open your bibles to the book of
[29:58] deuteronomy
[30:00] chapter 1
[30:00] [Music]
[30:02] the 19th verse
[30:21] [Music]
[30:22] and we departed from arab and we went
[30:24] through all the great and terrible
[30:25] wilderness which ye saw by the way of
[30:28] the mountain of the amorites as the lord
[30:30] our god commanded us and we came to
[30:32] cadence
[30:33] bernie sanders
[30:39] and i said unto you or come unto the
[30:40] mountain of the amorites which the lord
[30:42] our god doth give unto us
[30:53] behold the lord thy god hath set the
[30:55] lamb before thee go up and possess it as
[30:58] the lord god of thy fathers has said
[30:59] unto thee fear not neither be
[31:01] discouraged
[31:15] and it says like this is
[31:28] the church of the philippians these
[31:30] things saith he that is holy he that is
[31:32] true he that had the key of david he
[31:34] that openeth and no man shutteth and
[31:36] shutteth and no man openeth
[31:50] i know thy works behold i have set
[31:52] before thee an open door and no man can
[31:54] shut it for thou has little strength and
[31:56] has kept my word and has not denied my
[31:58] name
[32:01] let's jump to verse 12.
[32:10] yes
[32:20] him that overcometh will i make a pillar
[32:22] in the temple of my god and he shall go
[32:24] no more out and i will write upon him
[32:26] the name of my god in the name of the
[32:27] city of my god which is the new
[32:29] jerusalem which cometh down of heaven
[32:31] from my god and i will write upon him my
[32:33] new name
[32:35] you may be seated
[32:39] may the lord bless the reading of his
[32:40] word
[32:55] of the the series that we have uh
[32:59] and hopefully shortly we can finish the
[33:01] series
[33:06] i feel like
[33:07] one as brother ram felt one time
[33:11] encino liver of the home he says for a
[33:12] whole year he thought of the of the book
[33:14] of jokes
[33:17] it's about six or eight weeks
[33:22] there and they're on the ash sheets
[33:27] and said that a sister wrote him a
[33:28] letter
[33:31] he didn't want to she didn't want to be
[33:33] rude with him
[33:37] well when are you going to change the
[33:39] subject
[33:41] and that's how i feel with the lord
[33:44] or when can i change subjects
[33:49] and the reason why this has gotten a bit
[33:51] lengthy
[33:55] there's so much that's being found there
[33:57] on the open door
[34:01] that it takes
[34:02] too much time to explain
[34:19] it takes you to the baptism of the holy
[34:21] ghost
[34:24] takes you to the revelations of jesus
[34:25] christ
[34:27] takes you to the rapture
[34:30] it takes you there to the city of the
[34:32] new jerusalem
[34:43] it takes you first to the baptism of the
[34:45] holy ghost
[34:50] there's no way that we can get to the
[34:52] second portion
[34:54] without the baptism of the holy ghost
[34:57] what the ram says
[35:00] there's no way that a person can go to
[35:02] the rapture cintener el bautismo del
[35:04] espirito santo without having the
[35:06] baptism of the holy ghost
[35:09] so then having the holy ghost
[35:13] it's the most important thing someone
[35:15] can have
[35:17] foreign manifestation to advance to the
[35:20] second manifestation de la puerta
[35:23] of the open door
[35:27] so first it takes you to the baptism of
[35:29] the holy ghost
[35:32] the open door and brother venom says
[35:37] philadelphia it manifests in the midst
[35:39] of the age of philadelphia
[35:42] which is
[35:55] and there's things that the open door
[35:57] does
[36:00] during the sixth church age
[36:04] and there's things that the open door
[36:06] does
[36:08] during the seventh church
[36:21] because you have to understand that the
[36:22] open door is crystal it's christ
[36:39] other things that christ would do in
[36:41] life 6 like that in the sixth age como
[36:43] la puerta vietnam alike in the open door
[36:48] there's things that he would do on the
[36:49] seventh day
[36:51] but there are things that christ would
[36:52] do la puerta verta like in the open door
[36:56] even after the church ages
[37:01] that's why this age is very important
[37:04] because it begins with you usted
[37:16] because you receive jesus christ
[37:19] just as jesus christ
[37:24] you also have to do the same connell
[37:26] with him
[37:30] you have to open up your doors to him
[37:35] the same that jesus christ does
[37:38] what he wants to do with you
[37:42] you have to do reflect the same towards
[37:44] him
[37:46] and towards the others
[37:48] because your job
[38:17] since the days of luther they lived
[38:18] under justification
[38:22] the days of wesley they come a little
[38:24] higher leglesses
[38:27] sanctification the church became in the
[38:29] minority under sanctification
[38:39] which is the baptism of the holy ghost
[38:41] entonces
[38:43] so then in the fifth age
[38:46] with luther
[38:48] it was justification
[38:50] in the sixth age on wesley with wesley
[38:52] it has sanctification it was
[38:53] sanctification
[38:56] now in the seventh ages
[38:58] it's
[39:11] open door is a baptism of the holy ghost
[39:21] that's why he put it specifically
[39:24] between those two churches
[39:54] about the capstone
[39:57] now the open door
[40:01] it manifests in those stages which as i
[40:03] just mentioned
[40:08] the open door also manifests also in the
[40:10] capstone
[40:13] one of the manifestations of the open
[40:15] door is federated it's uh
[40:17] rapturing faith
[40:20] and the capstone the sienna
[41:40] by one spur we are all baptized in one
[41:43] body el cuales chris which is christ el
[41:46] puso
[41:51] he sent that message before the
[41:52] methodist church and they turn it aside
[41:54] from it
[41:58] they come up to satisfication and refuse
[42:00] the holy ghost
[42:03] do you remember that that's the open
[42:05] door
[42:07] how do you get into christ
[42:10] by one spirit el espiritu santo the holy
[42:12] spirit el cual es el espirito
[42:27] but by one holy ghost baptism
[42:32] we're all baptized into one body
[42:37] and made partakers of that body
[42:41] santo para entrar en
[43:03] now there's another another
[43:05] manifestation of the open door
[43:09] let's go to exodus the 21st chapter
[43:13] from the first verse
[43:16] now remember it's the year of jubilee la
[43:18] puerta vietnam the open door
[43:43] now these are the judgments which thou
[43:45] shalt set before them
[43:53] if thou by hero servant six years shall
[43:55] he serve and in the seventh shall he go
[43:58] out free for nothing
[44:01] now brother branham says
[44:04] right there where it says hebrew
[44:05] servants eso represents
[44:22] if he came by himself he should go by
[44:24] himself if he were married then he
[44:26] should then his wife shall go out with
[44:28] him
[44:38] if his master has given him a wife and
[44:40] she gave born him sons and daughters
[44:43] the wife and the children shall be the
[44:45] masters and he shall go out by himself
[44:48] entonces
[45:02] then his master shall bring him unto the
[45:04] judges he shall say i'll also bring him
[45:06] to the door or onto the doorpost and his
[45:08] master shall bore his ear through with
[45:11] and all and he shall serve him forever
[45:15] if you notice it says door
[45:31] a
[45:33] they're on verse 5.
[45:36] that the servant shall say
[45:42] i love my master my wife and my children
[45:43] i will not go out free este
[45:46] this is the response to brother branham
[45:49] ammo al diablo says i love the devil
[45:54] that's making me do these things
[45:58] that's all right
[46:03] i don't think think that you're just too
[46:04] narrow-minded up there yo
[46:09] i just think you're too narrow muy
[46:10] bienjo las cosas all right i love these
[46:13] things
[46:16] i think we ought to have these big
[46:18] things like this yes it is and do this
[46:22] world and we have dances
[46:37] and they're just as good as any other
[46:39] bunch that you go up there adelante
[46:48] all right now when i go out of this
[46:50] freedom of the spirit that you talk
[46:52] about
[46:53] entonces
[46:59] shall bring him to the judges
[47:03] and shall also bring you him to the door
[47:07] and notice what brother ram says
[47:08] [Music]
[47:50] and neglect
[48:04] and you can decide if you want to accept
[48:07] or if you want to reject
[48:13] the what who's the door
[48:16] the congregation says it's jesus christ
[49:14] if you reject
[49:29] your attitude towards the door
[49:32] your attitude towards christ
[49:35] shall determine if you're going to
[49:36] receive a mark
[49:40] or you're going to receive the seal of
[49:41] god
[50:06] if you want to accept or you want to
[50:07] reject
[50:09] we say is
[50:23] what do you mean brother branham
[50:29] if you hear the gospel truth and you
[50:31] refuse to walk in it
[50:37] then god marks your ear where you'll
[50:39] never hear it no more us
[50:43] you've crossed that the line between
[50:45] life and death
[50:49] just like they're in a natural they had
[50:50] a mark
[50:52] in the air
[50:54] the people today
[50:56] that reject christ
[50:58] for the last time
[51:01] they will receive a mark in their ear
[51:05] even though they might hear the gospel
[51:10] they will never have the opportunity to
[51:12] accept it
[51:15] because god himself has marked her here
[51:20] being that you
[51:35] hearing
[51:37] and faith is revelation
[51:39] and the open door
[51:42] is one of those manifestations
[51:45] it's the revelations of jesus christ
[51:48] it all depends
[52:17] that's how the open door manifests
[52:18] himself
[52:22] he continues
[52:26] you've crossed the line between life and
[52:27] death
[52:30] organization can you go on with your
[52:32] organization the nomination denomination
[52:36] the domination the rest of your days
[52:38] forever
[52:41] walk in the light children that's right
[53:12] i
[53:41] denominations
[53:46] he who the son has made free is free
[53:48] indeed
[53:52] if you want to go free and be free in
[53:54] the sun
[53:56] who's the son
[53:57] jesus christ
[54:03] to cut loose from all things
[54:06] and serve him
[54:22] of life
[54:36] you also
[54:48] or to the antichrist
[55:18] illa de christo and of christ
[55:22] it's the heaven
[55:23] it's the paradise
[55:26] it's what waits for you
[55:29] if you accept the mark of christ
[55:32] the seal of god
[55:45] like we said it's the revelations of
[55:47] jesus christ
[55:51] and i just mentioned it's between two
[55:53] ages
[55:55] now let's read this quote from brother
[55:56] branham
[55:58] philadelphia and the philadelphia church
[56:00] age this
[56:02] grand revelation now we found out that
[56:04] in this great revelation
[56:06] that god gave here to the church
[56:09] in these last days
[56:14] it got
[56:25] neither was in this other age of
[56:27] philadelphia philadelphia
[57:10] now the revelation of himself
[57:15] he built his church
[57:18] how do you know that's true
[57:23] he built his church upon the revelation
[57:25] of himself
[57:28] that's why it's the open door
[57:33] with the revelations of jesus christ
[57:37] it's his revelations
[57:55] the revelation of the supreme deity of
[57:57] jesus christ
[58:01] specific revelations
[58:03] of himself
[58:06] of his character specifically
[58:08] specifically
[58:10] it's revelations
[58:12] of his own heart
[58:13] anoint branham have you heard brother
[58:15] branham
[58:18] he said that he thought
[58:34] that christ is god's own heart
[58:36] yes christo and it's christ
[58:40] revealing himself
[58:43] just like christ has used
[58:47] that power of the sermon
[58:55] christ is also revealing his very own
[58:57] heart austere to you
[59:00] to you who accepted him
[59:17] revelation
[59:18] the revelations of your heart
[59:21] to christ
[59:25] you have to confess your sins
[59:29] that is what you must reveal there is
[59:41] you must reveal it to christ
[59:44] just like he's revealing his own self
[59:46] revelant
[59:47] revealing his heart
[59:50] and revealing it on to you
[59:53] now you must do the same revelant
[59:56] reveal your own self
[1:01:08] and the most marvelous thing
[1:01:12] after you have confessed all your
[1:01:13] secrets
[1:01:16] after you confessed all of your uh sins
[1:01:20] today he can't remember those no
[1:02:05] us human beings
[1:02:07] we forget something
[1:02:10] but then we'll remember it later on
[1:02:13] it's not like that with christ
[1:02:16] or with god the bible says
[1:02:46] enzo contra and the conch in your
[1:02:50] country and your contrary
[1:02:52] and
[1:02:53] against you
[1:02:57] but it will be against the devil
[1:03:14] you
[1:03:28] and he will remember never remember what

[1:03:46] principal that's the main door
[1:03:48] to enter that city

[1:05:20] john to the seven church ages which are
[1:05:22] in asia
[1:05:30] grace beyond to you and peace from the
[1:05:31] which
[1:05:32] from him which is which was and which
[1:05:34] will come from the seven spiritual
[1:05:36] spirits which are before his throne
[1:05:40] iglesias you see there in verse four it
[1:05:41] says the seven church ages
[1:05:45] which are in asia
[1:06:06] it's a small parcel of land about the
[1:06:08] size of indiana
[1:06:10] iglesias
[1:06:13] the seven churches were specifically
[1:06:15] picked from all churches
[1:06:18] iglesias
[1:06:19] characteristics from all other churches
[1:06:22] for their characteristics
[1:06:28] which same characteristic
[1:06:29] characteristics will be found in the
[1:06:31] successive ages centuries later entonces
[1:06:35] then these ages
[1:06:38] were first cities
[1:06:41] and then those cities
[1:06:43] or those churches
[1:06:59] and the seventh church ages
[1:07:02] but there's another age
[1:07:04] the age of the open door
[1:07:06] now that age
[1:07:09] it's also a city la nueva jerusalem the
[1:07:11] new jerusalem
[1:07:27] open doors manifesting itself
[1:07:31] as the revelations of jesus christ
[1:07:35] the second manifestation that we're
[1:07:36] waiting on is la federato it's the faith
[1:07:40] of the rapturing faith
[1:07:58] now let's return back to the beginning
[1:08:01] there in revelations 12.
[1:08:04] 3 12.
[1:08:25] him that overcometh will i make a pillar
[1:08:27] in the temple of my god and he shall go
[1:08:29] out no more and i will write upon him
[1:08:31] the name of my god in the name of the
[1:08:32] city of my god which is the new
[1:08:34] jerusalem which cometh down out of
[1:08:36] heaven from god and i will write upon
[1:08:37] him my new name
[1:08:41] so then these ages
[1:08:43] these cities
[1:08:46] have uh spirits in particular el mondo
[1:08:50] brother also teaches
[1:09:02] it's humor
[1:09:03] joking
[1:09:28] you can imagine certain things that
[1:09:29] happen in that city
[1:09:32] also with
[1:09:46] now there's not just one spirit i
[1:09:47] various
[1:09:48] but there's several spirits
[1:09:51] in that city
[1:09:53] but all of the spirits
[1:09:55] of that city
[1:09:59] are under the leadership of the holy
[1:10:00] ghost
[1:10:13] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:10:17] now there's several spirits in that city
[1:10:20] they got sense
[1:10:22] to help you
[1:10:25] because you're a citizen of that city
[1:10:43] under the leadership of the open doors
[1:10:45] chris
[1:10:46] which is christ himself
[1:10:48] diablos just like the devils
[1:10:51] the demons
[1:10:54] or the leadership of satan
[1:10:56] today
[1:11:11] it's the main
[1:11:12] spirit
[1:11:14] that you're going to find in that city
[1:11:17] this is the baptist of the holy ghost
[1:11:22] just with the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:11:54] like a father that did weddings for his
[1:11:56] son
[1:11:59] and they called the ones who were
[1:12:01] invited to the wedding
[1:12:03] and the ones who were invited
[1:12:06] had to come
[1:12:29] he goes around and sees those who are
[1:12:31] invited
[1:12:33] and he finds someone keno
[1:12:46] they cast them out from the wedding
[1:13:00] i would really would like to explain
[1:13:01] this
[1:13:20] that this this is we like unto the king
[1:13:22] or this shall be like onto the kingdom
[1:13:24] of heaven
[1:13:27] that's going to be taking place there in
[1:13:29] the heavens
[1:13:58] that would take you to the next stage
[1:14:01] of the open door
[1:14:03] which is rapturing faith
[1:14:05] and it will take you to the next stage
[1:14:09] living or abiding in that city
[1:14:12] where
[1:14:41] of that city
[1:14:43] in this moment
[1:14:45] not there in the future
[1:14:48] now in this moment
[1:14:58] takes you to the revelations of jesus
[1:15:00] christ
[1:15:01] takes you to the rapture
[1:15:04] and it takes you to the new jerusalem
[1:15:07] we already read the scriptures
[1:15:35] speaking how the open door would take
[1:15:36] you to the new jerusalem
[1:15:41] now he's not only giving out crowns
[1:15:47] but he says that these that in the bride
[1:15:50] will be made pillars in the temple of
[1:15:51] god
[1:15:53] but what is the temple of god jesus
[1:15:57] jesus spoke of his body as being the
[1:15:59] temple
[1:16:01] temple
[1:16:02] it was it was the temple of god
[1:16:33] a pillar is actually a part of the
[1:16:34] foundation for it holds up to the
[1:16:36] superstructure
[1:16:39] just like the columns that we have here
[1:16:40] in the church
[1:16:42] they sustain the building
[1:16:46] god himself tells
[1:17:27] shall i make a pillar in the temple of
[1:17:28] my god
[1:17:30] he's going to place you in the monobram
[1:17:32] disease
[1:17:35] with joshua
[1:17:38] when they entered in the promised land
[1:17:42] joshua placed every tribe in sierta
[1:17:45] party and certain places
[1:17:48] it also says in the parallel
[1:17:52] what joshua did in the naturals
[1:17:56] is being shown
[1:18:04] it's paul placing each one in the body
[1:18:06] of christ
[1:18:08] and it's in the same book
[1:18:11] that paul explains to us
[1:18:16] what is the foundation of the city of
[1:18:17] god
[1:18:20] what is the foundation that you should
[1:18:22] have
[1:18:23] are you understanding me
[1:18:36] now therefore you're no more strangers
[1:18:38] than foreigners but fellow citizens
[1:18:40] with the saints
[1:18:44] apostles
[1:18:51] and
[1:18:52] the household the household of god and
[1:18:54] and are built upon the foundation of the
[1:18:55] apostles and prophets with jesus christ
[1:18:57] himself being the chief cornerstone
[1:19:03] coordinator
[1:19:05] um
[1:19:08] in whom all the buildings fitly framed
[1:19:10] together growth onto the holy temple of
[1:19:12] the lord
[1:19:19] in whom ye also are building together
[1:19:20] for inhabitation of god through the
[1:19:22] spirit this is
[1:19:24] fundamental this is your edified through
[1:19:27] the foundation
[1:19:29] of the apostles and prophets
[1:19:32] and that is this message
[1:20:02] you're edified through that foundation
[1:20:08] specifically you believing this message
[1:20:11] especially
[1:20:12] and especially
[1:20:15] having the life of the message within
[1:20:17] you
[1:20:19] there's many people that's in the
[1:20:20] message
[1:20:22] there's very few where the message is
[1:20:24] inside of them
[1:20:26] the message has to be inside
[1:20:30] through the baptism
[1:20:32] of the holy ghost
[1:20:34] now and only in that way
[1:20:36] no no no
[1:20:38] not just reading and hearing it
[1:20:41] necesita is an experience that you must
[1:20:44] have
[1:20:58] the revelations of jesus christ
[1:21:00] rapturing faith rapturing faith
[1:21:05] that's what says we're already in
[1:21:05] heavenly places
[1:21:08] and the new jerusalem
[1:21:11] now in these moments
[1:21:55] philadelphia on that same quote in the
[1:21:57] philadelphia age
[1:22:00] explicando lo que a cerca de la puerta
[1:22:02] he continues saying about the the open
[1:22:04] door
[1:22:06] he just finished reading the scriptures
[1:22:22] everything went through the door jesus
[1:22:23] yes
[1:22:26] and it is part of that body or tempo
[1:22:32] now when god puts a man in the temple
[1:22:34] come on column as a pillar
[1:22:55] because that is exactly what the
[1:22:56] apostles and prophets had las misma
[1:22:59] revelations
[1:23:00] the same revelations
[1:23:04] you have
[1:23:05] el mismo fundamento it's the same
[1:23:07] foundation
[1:23:09] pablo just as paul usted pedro you and
[1:23:12] peter los apostolis the apostles
[1:23:15] and the prophets
[1:23:18] are going to live in the same city
[1:23:24] let's read it again
[1:23:28] he's given the revelation of the word
[1:23:30] and of himself
[1:23:36] because that is exactly what the
[1:23:37] apostles and prophet had illoaki
[1:23:39] including
[1:23:40] then he includes the scripture
[1:23:43] matthew 16 17.
[1:23:45] jesus
[1:24:15] i will build my church
[1:24:18] what rock regress
[1:24:20] return to ephesians
[1:24:23] it was the cornerstone
[1:24:28] the revelations
[1:24:53] the revelation of jesus christ what they
[1:24:55] called
[1:24:57] they cause spiritual strength
[1:25:00] vamos a apocalypse

[1:25:08] 3 8.
[1:25:24] i know that works behold i set before
[1:25:26] thee an open door and no man can shut it
[1:25:28] for that has little strength and has
[1:25:30] kept my word and has not denied my name
[1:25:36] due to time i can't read the quotes
[1:25:52] though you have
[1:26:20] the tapes
[1:26:34] last year
[1:26:35] uh ami yami yami papa now for me my my

[1:26:54] but i had it
[1:26:56] obligatory so i was under
[1:26:58] the obligation of quarantine
[1:27:03] but to my parents it struck them a bit
[1:27:05] more harder
[1:27:08] i know here there's some that that got
[1:27:09] struck by kovitz
[1:27:14] you can only imagine the effects that
[1:27:15] they had
[1:27:44] especially
[1:27:59] revelation
[1:28:02] it took about three or four days
[1:28:06] now i didn't really know what i was
[1:28:07] looking for
[1:28:11] but i knew there was something that i
[1:28:12] was searching for
[1:28:14] but since i couldn't go to work
[1:28:20] so i could have i stayed up late to one
[1:28:22] o'clock in the morning
[1:28:25] i would study and study
[1:29:07] and the symptoms were very harsh
[1:29:37] then i went and i shared it with my
[1:29:38] parents
[1:29:41] and my parents told me
[1:29:42] las gracias truly they gave me the
[1:29:44] thanks

[1:30:06] with his people
[1:30:07] it is
[1:30:09] for 21 days
[1:30:12] they didn't have an answer
[1:30:14] but but there was a battle entre los
[1:30:16] espiritus within the spirit
[1:30:23] and the prince of persia
[1:30:25] diaz for 21 days daniel no tenia
[1:30:28] daniel did not have an answer
[1:30:31] and he was praying
[1:30:34] searching for the lord
[1:30:37] and for 21 days he did not have an
[1:30:38] answer
[1:30:41] but finally that finished
[1:30:44] and gabriel came to daniel
[1:31:26] it takes you to the new jerusalem
[1:31:45] [Music]
[1:31:52] now john speaks about certain tribes
[1:31:56] foreign
[1:32:10] a different group
[1:32:28] after this i beheld and law a great
[1:32:30] multitude which no man could number of
[1:32:32] all nations and kindreds and people and
[1:32:35] tongues stood before the throne and
[1:32:37] before the lamb clothed with white robes
[1:32:39] and palms in their hands
[1:32:42] blancas those were cesar white
[1:32:46] robes
[1:32:48] verse 10.
[1:32:51] and they cried with a loud voice
[1:32:59] saying salvation to our god would sit
[1:33:01] upon the throne on on to the lamb
[1:33:04] los angeles
[1:33:13] now the angels stood around about the
[1:33:15] throne and about the elders and the four
[1:33:16] beasts and fell before the throne of
[1:33:18] their faces and worshiped god
[1:33:20] amen
[1:33:32] amen blessing and glory and wisdom and
[1:33:34] thanksgiving and honor and power and
[1:33:36] might be on to our god forever and ever
[1:33:38] amen
[1:33:47] and one of the elders answers on to me
[1:33:49] what are these which are arrayed in
[1:33:51] white robes and once came they
[1:33:53] led
[1:33:55] me
[1:33:57] answered
[1:34:06] said to me these are they which came
[1:34:09] out of the great tribulation have washed
[1:34:10] their robes and made them white in the
[1:34:12] blood of the lamb
[1:34:21] therefore are they before the throne of
[1:34:24] god and serve him day and night in this
[1:34:25] temple and he sat and sitteth on the
[1:34:27] throne shall do all among them
[1:34:30] he said
[1:34:35] they shall hunger no more neither thirst
[1:34:37] anymore neither shall the sun light on
[1:34:39] them nor any heat
[1:34:43] now that city would be as hot as phoenix
[1:34:57] for the lamb which sit which in the
[1:34:59] midst of the throne shall feed them and
[1:35:00] shall lead them on the living on the
[1:35:02] living towns of waters and shall god
[1:35:04] shall wipe away their tears from their
[1:35:05] eyes

[1:35:49] and serve him in the temple
[1:35:54] they are the special care of the lord
[1:35:55] they are his bride
[1:36:00] the bride goes where the bridegroom is
[1:36:02] she will never leave leave
[1:36:05] be left by him
[1:36:08] she will never leave his side
[1:36:12] she will share the throne with him

[1:36:16] she will be crowned with his glory and
[1:36:18] honor
[1:36:20] amen

[1:36:34] you have to reflect the city of which
[1:36:36] you come laude

[1:37:04] and had not partaken of it
[1:37:09] they had not let the world systems
[1:37:11] overcome them
[1:37:18] politically
[1:37:20] when the
[1:37:21] illustrious names of that age had
[1:37:23] yielded to the
[1:37:24] blandishment of that state and chosen
[1:37:26] political minds
[1:37:27] maintenance yes
[1:37:32] and they were going back
[1:37:34] the way back into the world
