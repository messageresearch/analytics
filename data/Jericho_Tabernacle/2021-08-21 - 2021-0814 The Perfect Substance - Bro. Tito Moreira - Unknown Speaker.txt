to say words because um i told her she stole this song from me it's called alabaster box and that's it's actually a story and i wanted to say in spanish what it's about because i love this song it's about a woman who walks in to a place with a little alabaster box of alabaster and she actually there's a whole story about it she washes jesus feet with her tears but when she walked in the people judged and said this isn't a place for her what like what is she doing here and i wondered how many times we've judged others and we wonder what people what do what are that person doing and it was such a blessing for me it's like that's my song i told her so she i would sing it but i don't know how to sing so she'll sing it and i hope it blesses you god bless you thank you [Music] the room grew still as she made a way to jesus she stumbles through the tears that made her blind she felt such pain some spoke in anger heard folks whisper there's no place here for her kind still all she came through the shame that flushed her face until at his last and though she spoke no words everything she said was heard as she poured her love for the master from her box of alabaster so i've come to pour prayer [Music] don't be angry if i wash his feet with my tears [Music] cause you weren't there the night he found me and you did not feel what i felt when he wrapped his love and arms around me and you don't know the cost of the oil in my own [Music] i can't forget the way life used to be [Music] cause i was a prisoner to the sin that had me bound i spent my days put my life without measure into a little treasure box i thought i'd found until the day when jesus came to me and healed my soul with the wonder of his touch so now i'm giving back to him all the is worthy of i've been forgiven and that's why i love him so much and i've come to pour my praise on him like oil from mary's alabaster box so don't be angry if i wash his feet with my tears and i dry them with my [Music] jesus

here can say lord i need more faith there's a story in the bible and matthew and matteo don't we don't open to matthew but it's it's where the disciples tried to pray for somebody that had epilepsy escuela and i like how it says it in in the spanish version it says because of your little faith that's why you couldn't take it out and then and then in luke and lucas there's an [Applause] how many here could tell that [Applause] maybe it's my [Applause] so that's why we're here tonight now we want to talk about hebrews 11. and the subject is going to be the title is going to be the perfect substance it says like this this i see now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen especially [Music] [Music] if we can just receive it tonight [Music] may we just [Applause] [Applause] [Music] can you find somebody that you haven't seen in a while it's good to see you just we want to talk about the perfect substance amen amen now the word substance i want you to pay attention to this a little bit the word substance means the main and most important component of something significant means the main and most important component of something es component principal and most important so as we talk about about faith being the perfect substance i want to talk about three things tonight number one i want to talk about faith which is the real thing faith is the real deal [Applause] fave is something worth fighting for if i'm gonna [Applause] we're is [Applause] is and many times the devil wants to tell you that you're not even saved [Music] it if we're going to go through the hard path we better make sure that this is real we better make sure that there's substance behind substance it's something is made mas fuerte produced by nature que producer naturalessa that's why it's so precious you know they say that diamonds are a woman's best friend que los amantes only la mego mejor de la mujer i don't know if that's true or not i know my wife likes diamonds but there's something more precious there's something more scarce than diamonds and that is [Applause] [Applause] that we don't walk by sight but faith is not blind i'm going to say it again the bible says that we don't walk by psyche vista we've all heard that right but i want to tell you something faith is not blind [Applause] that our natural senses cannot [Applause] [Applause] existed hebrews 11 3 says through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god in english i like the way the new living translation says translation it says by faith we understand that the entire universe was formed or yes formed at god's command universe [Applause] did not come from anything that can be seen [Music] that's not what the bible says [Music] it's talking about how it says that all of that serves unto the example and shadow of heavenly things in other words what it's saying [Applause] they existed over there the holy place in is something that's [Applause] yes [Music] i don't have to get you excited so that it happens i don't have to get you to repeat it one thousand times so that you get it it's already done it's already done he
