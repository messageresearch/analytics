[37:15] every single one of you
[37:18] if we can open our bibles to the second
[37:20] chronicles
[37:24] the 20th chapter
[37:27] the 17th verse
[37:31] amen and it says like this this scene
[37:36] second chronicles 2017.
[37:41] ye shall not need to fight in this
[37:44] battle
[37:45] set yourselves stand ye still and see
[37:48] the salvation of the lord
[37:50] be with you o judah and jerusalem fear
[37:53] not
[37:53] nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against
[37:56] them for the lord will be with you
[38:14] amen may the lord add the blessing of
[38:16] his word may you take your seats
[38:21] you know before i begin um
[38:24] i'd like to i'd like to to thank sister
[38:28] lupita alvarado
[38:45] johnny's ties una de las corbatas de
[38:47] elle manojani
[38:48] and um instead of letting me borrow one
[38:51] embezz
[38:53] she gave me one and so this this this is
[38:57] a tie
[38:57] that i i have on right now
[39:01] and when she brought up all the ties
[39:05] you know it was a bunch of ties
[39:08] and um i would look for the one that
[39:11] really looked like or typified by the
[39:13] johnny
[39:17] johnny well johnny had a lot of ties but
[39:19] it looked like he always wore the same
[39:20] ones
[39:24] so i wanted that one that that looked
[39:26] like him
[39:30] so hopefully this thai will give me the
[39:32] anointment
[39:36] your brother johnny was very long-winded
[39:40] i might preach
[39:53] so i'm going to say that that's the same
[39:55] this evening
[39:57] so i'd like to thank the family
[40:04] um um this evening
[40:07] i'd like to continue on our subject that
[40:09] we have
[40:11] continued
[40:15] and uh the reason why we got this
[40:18] message
[40:21] is because we're about demonology
[40:27] and we're counter-attacking that yes
[40:31] and brother brown says we we hear a lot
[40:32] about demons
[40:36] but you hardly
[41:06] so the last time we were here we spoke
[41:07] about character ultimate
[41:10] character to have our character to be
[41:12] like christ
[41:16] and um in this in this evening
[41:27] and here's a quote from brother branham
[41:29] and the message 1955.
[41:32] extracted the position of a believer in
[41:36] christ
[41:38] now it says now with the help of god
[41:41] this afternoon
[41:44] holy scriptures if
[41:49] let's try to place the believer
[41:51] positionally in christ
[41:56] now he did not say let's try to place
[41:59] the believer positionally
[42:15] is it what excuse me what and show what
[42:17] his authority is in christ
[42:21] then everybody out there
[42:24] will be praying for the sick and we'll
[42:27] have a great meeting i'm
[42:31] see it says and he will show us the
[42:33] authority that we have in christ
[42:38] on our base scripture on second
[42:39] chronicles
[42:47] the beginning of the chapter it begins
[42:49] to talk about jehoshaphat
[42:52] and we find jehoshaphat in the corner
[42:54] here
[42:56] is
[43:11] ahab was a lukewarm believer a cabernet
[43:15] the one who was married to jezebel
[43:18] and they were going to go into war with
[43:20] some different nations
[43:24] the battle of raymond gilead
[43:28] and so joseph began to tell ahab where's
[43:31] your prophets so we can see
[43:32] we should go up there
[43:38] and although all of ahab's prophet said
[43:40] where you you're going to get it
[43:46] don't you have one more out there
[43:48] somewhere
[43:51] and you can find that on the 18th
[43:52] chapter of second chronicles
[43:58] he says yeah i got one he says his name
[44:01] is micah the son of imla
[44:04] i hate him for he never prophesied good
[44:07] on to me
[44:11] they go on to war and ahab dies
[44:16] and so here jehoshaphat is there and
[44:19] this
[45:26] and and we find on the 13th verse on
[45:28] chapter 20.
[45:59] us as long as we can stick together
[46:05] we we stay in our positions
[46:10] then the spirit of the lord can speak
[46:12] and don't
[46:20] and it says thus saith the lord unto you
[46:24] it says be not afraid not
[46:52] for the battle is not yours
[47:31] so i want you to notice what the spirit
[47:33] of the lord told him what to do
[47:37] and i'm going to jump to the 17th verse
[47:39] that was our base scripture
[47:43] and it says ye shall not need to fight
[47:45] in this battle
[47:49] you imagine that imagine the lord or the
[47:52] general tells you you don't have to
[47:53] fight this battle
[47:57] this is the only thing you got to do
[48:02] you're not going to fight this is the
[48:04] only thing you got to do
[48:07] set yourselves and stand ye
[48:11] still now set yourselves
[48:16] stay in your position
[49:04] stand still and you will see the
[49:05] salvation of the lord be with you
[49:11] many times we want to go and fight and
[49:13] go and fight
[49:14] this we want to physically sometimes
[49:18] even go fight physically
[49:21] you know where we're still christians we
[49:24] want to go
[49:25] fight it physically
[49:28] stand in your position
[49:40] when i say church i mean all of them
[50:07] and they don't know who they are they're
[50:09] not having a son i'm gonna repeat that
[50:10] one more time
[50:14] find two classes of people encounter
[50:16] those different classes
[50:18] i find fundamental people enjoy
[50:20] fundamental
[50:21] who positionally know their position in
[50:23] christ
[50:38] is that's got
[50:41] that's got a lot of money in the bank
[50:44] and can't write a check
[50:47] and the other one can write a check
[50:51] and ain't got no money in the bank
[50:54] if you could get two of them together
[50:58] if you could get two of them together
[51:01] if you could get the faith that's in the
[51:02] pentecostal fundamental people
[51:06] pentecostal
[51:34] did you understand what i just said he
[51:37] says it says if we can get both of them
[51:38] together
[51:41] it's like a man who has a lot of money
[51:43] in the bank
[51:46] but he can't write a check
[52:27] but that's why every single time that we
[52:30] should come to the service of the lord
[52:35] that we have the truth
[52:38] you're blind because you want to be
[52:40] blind
[52:43] you don't want to be in your possession
[52:44] you know your position but you don't
[52:45] want to be in your position
[52:49] it says if we can know our positions
[52:57] when we can have authority with
[52:59] character
[53:02] then we can reign now i want you to
[53:06] notice something
[53:08] we're speaking about position not our
[53:11] position in the church
[53:12] no la position
[53:24] you have to know who you are
[53:28] sometimes we ask the people or the young
[53:30] people
[53:32] do you know who you are and a lot of
[53:36] people go around i don't know who i am
[53:39] who am i who am i they're going around
[53:42] circles and circles in circles
[53:45] i don't know who i am but you're a son
[53:48] and you're a daughter of god it's very
[53:52] easy to say that
[53:54] you see this but the hard thing is to
[53:55] accept that you're a son and a daughter
[53:57] of god
[54:00] and why is it hard to accept something
[54:01] like that
[54:04] because you see a long list of mistakes
[54:09] you see a long list of all the mistakes
[54:11] that you have done
[54:15] you say how can i be a son of god
[54:19] can i be a daughter of god that's
[54:22] exactly
[54:36] you're
[55:04] because
[55:32] can you imagine the criticism that
[55:34] joshua got imagined
[55:37] you're not a prophet you're not moses
[55:41] how dare you stand behind that pupil
[55:46] never did that voice
[55:59] renegades of israel
[56:14] see moses did that you did it
[56:18] you imagine the pressure is the la
[56:20] president and the lord told them
[56:23] cross over jordan in three days
[56:27] and the paulie the brother garcia says
[56:29] probably the engineers in those times
[56:34] joshua you're not moses god won't answer
[56:38] you you're not a prophet
[56:41] i'm going to open up the sea for you
[57:09] i am a warrior
[57:37] trying to get you out
[57:51] cancer leave in the name of the lord
[57:53] jesus christ
[57:56] what you can do you can be in your
[57:59] position
[58:04] that's what the devil says
[58:24] [Music]
[58:34] those evangelists
[59:30] is
[59:41] you are kennedys
[59:46] you think the devil's going to come out
[59:48] because you believe what brother branham
[59:49] is
[59:53] you think the devil's going to come out
[59:54] because you believe who brother johnny
[59:55] and brother garcia is
[1:00:16] [Music]
[1:00:39] they are in the name of christ who paul
[1:00:41] preaches get out of here
[1:00:46] who are you yeah and the devil said who
[1:00:48] kin eddie i know who christ is
[1:00:51] i know who paul is
[1:01:07] he knows who he is do you know who you
[1:01:11] are
[1:01:12] it doesn't matter how small your
[1:01:14] position is
[1:01:16] your position could be so small
[1:01:20] but you can do more pero
[1:01:26] you know see the devil really wanted to
[1:01:28] get job out of his
[1:01:30] position
[1:01:33] the devil said lord
[1:02:17] i'm out of his position
[1:02:31] one disaster after
[1:02:33] [Music]
[1:02:38] and it seems like it's getting darker
[1:02:40] and darker and darker
[1:02:44] probably probably the devil part when he
[1:02:46] took away his kids
[1:02:49] he said okay i'm just waiting he was
[1:02:51] probably waiting around the corner
[1:02:55] i'm waiting for him to curse god
[1:02:59] have you ever cursed god before
[1:03:28] good and there was joe
[1:03:31] guest of a home one after another one
[1:03:34] after another
[1:03:36] his own wife
[1:03:40] said won't you just die and curse your
[1:03:51] [Music]
[1:03:57] probably felt like he wanted to give up
[1:04:03] i'm not gonna lie one of us sometimes we
[1:04:05] feel like giving up
[1:04:10] the greatest pastor
[1:04:24] stranger i'm an alien in their sights
[1:04:29] i call my servant and he gives me no
[1:04:32] answer
[1:04:34] i call my friends amigos they have left
[1:04:37] me
[1:04:37] immediately
[1:04:51] young children despise me
[1:04:56] i arose and they speak against me
[1:05:00] all my inward friends have hurt me
[1:05:05] and whom i loved are turned
[1:05:13] sometimes you have to separate from
[1:05:16] everything
[1:05:16] that's there on earth
[1:05:42] i'm sure you can read between the lines
[1:05:44] what i'm saying
[1:05:48] is
[1:05:50] the very dearest person on earth
[1:05:54] you have to shake hands with them
[1:05:58] and take your position in christ
[1:06:01] to where god has called you see
[1:06:05] but what is god doing transforming you
[1:06:08] from what you was
[1:06:09] transforming he's transforming you
[1:06:13] testa maybe a daughter a son
