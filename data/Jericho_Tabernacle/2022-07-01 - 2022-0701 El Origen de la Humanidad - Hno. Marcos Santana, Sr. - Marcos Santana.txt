[Music] modern bible says first corinthians 2 14 but the but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolish unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but the animal man it words us as animals that's why i asked him to read it and here it says the natural man but in my bible it says otherwise the last scripture john 3 5. they say responding jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of god you may be seated what we're going to speak on is something that no one can give you we see all the nations of the world like homosexuality and all types of deprived things [Music] but those that know the word of god we know they won't be able to do it and it doesn't work for them and all that won't stop evil because we're at the end time will come and take his children the temperature elevates the air we breathe it's contaminated earthquakes all over hurricanes temperatures these extreme and all types of things but how is the humans condition the human being's condition today presently kill and kill and kill mujeres women are raped children disappearing and all types of other things a solution to their problems and corruption and mainly juventus 24-32 why does god do this it is and it says where for god gave them up to uncleanliness of their hearts of their to dishonor their own bodies between themselves who changed amen amen they changed their natural effects their natural use and likewise also the men the han leaving the natural use of the woman burned and and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge they didn't care about anything they didn't retain god god gave them over with all unrighteousness they were fed up they were full of decay with what fornication fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness are worthy have pleasure in them that do them hey come here man let's go check out that woman they they have pleasure in doing it with them that also do it can you notice what condition the world is in presently you've [Music] in and everything that makes up this planet earth when he finished creating it everything everything was perfect there was no climate weather change no via [Music] so god created man in his own image in the image of god created him male and female created he them god is a spirit and he created another like him amen amen and god bless you and said unto them be fruitful and multiply thing that moves upon the earth he gave them there a commission amen to replenish to multiply and replenish the earth just like god and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good it's not good that the man should be alone there he performed a surgery he opened brought out a rib he stitched it up a perfect surgery he brought out una costilla he closed the flesh there back to its place and the rib which the lord got it taken from man you made a woman and flesh of my what was her name first woman because she came out of him was a byproduct of his there was no time the man had already and said unto him where art thou yes he said i heard thy voice in the garden i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself can you imagine i heard your voice in the garden and i hid because i was naked who told thee was naked [Music] wherever and she he but he no longer asks the serpent and the lord god said unto the serpent after he judged them he cast him out of eden genesis 3 24. we're giving homework for the youth he drove out the man that one day they die so then what happened [Music] they started to multiply they replenish the earth and they think that that way that god wanted them to multiply no no no no because they did not multiply the way that god wants it they were born in sin but and now we're here to noah genesis says genesis 6. can you say soon genesis 16 and it came to pass when men began to multiply the face of the earth and daughters were born into them these men that they were fair how were they they were beautiful and how they dressed and it is in the i said look who's that one she tells me of a little friend when she went to high school or middle school i knew her fair and she was ugly ugly now beautiful [Music] anywhere verse 3 verse 3. and the lord said no my spirit shall not always strive with man for remember the first scriptures what what fault did the animals have he grabbed him all the same he destroyed everything i'm in amen the entire because noah's family benia came in and all that they produced was evil just like the other ones amen amen amen amen john 3 16. forgive me john 3 1. there was a man of the name with the name man of the first his name nicodemus the ruler of the jews this same came to jesus by night and said rabbi we know there are a teacher come from god where no man can do the miracles except god be with him this unto enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born and jesus answered now he made it more difficult first he said that he would not see it then he said cannot enter yeah at that point he no longer even answered him yes he didn't even bother with nicodemus he gave him the solution he said look what's born of flesh is the flesh what's born of the spirit is when they've not been born
