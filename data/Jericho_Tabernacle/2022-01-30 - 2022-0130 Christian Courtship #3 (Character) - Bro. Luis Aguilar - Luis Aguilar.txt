situation with a sibling that she doesn't want to come to church so i began to be desperate and ask the lord for those things [Music] so one week i study and i fast and pray um and everything i heard throughout that week it was it was just about the word of god [Music] and i didn't have that revelation or what was the or what was the the spoken word so i just kept asking and praying and to my

like moses when he spoke to the rock he shouldn't smite a rock he should have spoke to it because god had already done all the miracles through him he should have he should have spoke the word anton

your word and to and may you give the revelation of the word as we bring forth these messages father may you be with us lord father may it be with the only purpose to edify the individual in the church heavenly father we just ask you lord to be with us throughout these times amen amen amen are you happy to be in the house of the lord amen are you tired of me yet yes i'm concerned to me hey man you saw me sunday and then friday and uh you see me here again now you're enjoying the series so far amen a christian courtship el nobiazo christian amen you might say well brother you know i got married before i actually did all these steps that's fine i'll be in just go back with your wife restart a friendship with your wife restart that courtship with your wife it shouldn't just stop when you get married amen amen amen you love the lord that's good if you love the lord you will eventually love me amen on this morning we're going to speak on on the subject of character established and we can open up our base scripture that we have i hope by now you already memorized it hebrews 13 4. says marriage is honorable law and the bed undefiled but whoremongers and adulterers god would judge us it says that the marriage should be honored by everyone you should honor marriage there's nothing something that you should take it out lightly and the marriage don't defile it uh no lo manche keep it pure a man but uh adulterers the fornicators and the sexually immoral morales you may take your seats um i hope i hope that uh you love me enough i hope i can stay in my time amen amen so here we we on last sunday we spoke on the foundation then on friday we spoke about christian friends christianos and today we want to kind of try to touch the surface of courtship and courtship is that i gave the definition of courtship it says it's the act or process of period of courting is here the definition says it's a period of time when you're recording and we've had many examples where brother branham will always be courting his wife even though he was already married amen amen and what is the importance of courtship in this stage you want to completely woo or win over the other person you never want to stop being in that stage that stage you really want to find out the character of one another there you want to show your best attributes you can come and you bring her a flower you can come and she can bring you something but there you really want to complete you want to uh win each other and like again you want to look at the character that that's a very important stage because people just think of courtship they think it's just a lovey-dovey stage but really and truly we should come really wise with that stage notice when they're in the fellowship notice how that young man talks to his mom and dad and vice versa how the young lady talks to her mom and dad because we should be looking for character even though she has a pretty set of eyes even though she might seem really nice or he might preach really nicely but that's that's good whatnot when we hear the phrase in spanish that that sister she's got a character that brother he's got a character el espanol the hispanic uses the word character like a type of attitude or temperament amen amen but brother branham he's a prophet we have to understand how the prophet speaks when he says character he's not talking about the temperament of a person he's talking about characteristics characteristics we've noticed moses did he marry a dove paloma not one amen but everybody laughed she was brother brown said she was a chainsaw el mano brand name so if my wife wants to fight with me and i fight with her that means they were both polishing each other oh god i wish you gave me the wife like that brother is where the knife is going to be sharpened amen amen so the woman helps the man get into his position amen amen amen so it's character character is one of the attributes or features of characteristics that make up and distinguish an individual component so brother ram says look for character it doesn't say so we want to see how that person is individual how they behave is to see how he or she treats her parents it's house how he or she treats their parents why brother luis if he wants to fight his mom and dad all the time and disrespects his mom all the time when i see someone disrespecting another person and talking to him really rudely but they want to pray really nice and sweet to the lord the way you talk to each and every single one of us that's how you pray to god if you think about it and the way you treat your husband that's how you treat god they don't confess a time and a place for that amen amen oh if you leave me i'm going to go back to drugs i'm going to go i'm going to stop going to church no brother don't do that amen amen very few amen you want to show the best qualities of yourself let's go to genesis 24. on the second verse and abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had put i pray thee thy hand o under my thighs and i will make they swear by the lord the god of heaven and the god of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife onto my son of the daughters of the canaanites among whom i dwell what are we reading about here the question wording about when isaac already research reached a certain age he he already knew his responsibilities abraham was getting old and he felt it was time for isaac to have a wife i'm going to make you swear verse 4 says but thou shalt go on to my country and take a wife onto my son isaac so they're there we're proving with the scriptures the testimony of on their testimonies going to say that again we cannot base ourselves on their testimony we have to base ourselves on the word of god so he was saying go go to my country to my kingdom according to the law and was brought up in a religious home to believe on jehovah so notice ahab he had some good roots he fell in love with some little i'm going to say how brother branham says it is some flapped eye thing of an idolater hey man you love the lord amen man brother braham says that's right this is and today fine christian men buenos ombres cristianos are fell under the the sway of such nonsense and glamour dominion because their that heart hasn't been stable in christ jesus christ why do they fall for women like that look for someone who works out uh christians are merry christians cristianos brother ram says you see ahab was reigning in israel and israel at the time over israel israel he was the wickedest kings of all of israel he failed not to continue to please to displease god and everything that he did although he had a great military system and the people had become become very prosperous under his reign instead of marrying among his own people no doubt jezebel was a beautiful woman but he had fell for what she looked like instead of what she was that so many people make the same mistake to this day we fall because she wears a nice dress because she comes from a renowned named family and he looked like a really good gentleman we fall for what they look like instead of who they are it doesn't matter if they come from a renown family or they always come to church you have to look at their character look how they behave look how they act there's many people that that are that come here to church but they're not christians i'm going to say that again there's people that come to church but they're not really you stay away from [Laughter] because it's if the sisters keep talking about about the whole brothers about the church characteristics characteristics look for characters well brother i married someone here from church from the world yeah yeah but i'm taking it higher than that there's christians there are people here that are not really christians amen amen genesis 24 9. uh and the servant put his hand under the thigh of abraham his master and swear to him concerning the matter and the servant took 10 camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand and he arose and went to mesopotamia on to the city of nehora so what do we see here there in the tenth verse what i put is that i put that he was preparing himself that he was getting ready and later on as we continue this we're going to talk about how a young man should prepare himself in the natural vamos a ver como joben it's going to say good when a young man wants to marry a young lady and tells her how would i marry you you think that he should tell his father-in-law to pay for the wedding you someone say that again i'm gonna nail it really good right here so you can get ready for the next time if a young man wants to marry a young lady if i ever the lord ever gives is love that's what i'm saying young ladies you should look for those characteristics i want to marry you honey but can your dad sign us a check check so there i put on 10 first that he's preparing himself he's preparing he's getting everything ready to go and and to look for a wife and he made his he made his camels to kneel down without the city by the well of the water at the time of the evening even the time that with the women go out to draw water and he said oh lord of god of my master abraham i pray thee send me good speed this day and show kindness unto my master abraham abram now you notice what he did what did he do he prayed as soon as he got everything ready he got the holy ghost he was ready uh materialistic after that he prayed he said god help me today that's the first thing you're supposed to do to seek after a while he prayed to seek after god he said god help me today may i have success today oh lord my god help me to have success to look for a good wife the first thing he did was pray he didn't go started looking talking behold i and notice right here he's gonna he's going to pray for a certain character he's going to pray for something to make her different amongst all the others they may all and he says and let it come to pass [Music] drink and i will give that camel's drink also let the same bee that be let the same beachy that thou has appointed for thy servant isaac and thereby shall i know that thou has shown kindness onto my master what was he praying for certain characteristics praying for certain features to make gabriel there was many women out there and and all of the city there yeah but gabriel came to one in pacific she kept her virtues she kept her dignity [Applause] god has to back up his word rebecca that's that's sweet that's a good little nugget oh and her picture upon her shoulder i would like to see the young ladies with their bible under their arm we probably won't obviously carry a picture but when a young lady carries her bible coming to church but let us not forget our ipads and our phones and our purses that's that's fine but i have the bible in here characteristics characteristics 16 yes he says notice nothing and the damsel was very fair to look upon them and hearing spanish says it really directly it means she was very pretty a virgin vitikin neither had any man known her on friday we spoke about those virtues how many of you went back to the invisible union of the bride of christ go back to that message he speaks about the virtues that a woman should keep elaborated her virginity or feminism for motherhood so maternity she should keep that las vegas and notice here there's a bigger responsibility that's why the parents shouldn't let their daughters just go with any man no he's the son of a minister sometimes they're the most you're responsible for that young ladies keep your virtues amen young parents don't let their daughters dress immorally don't let them walk out the house that way in the casa and the servant ran to meet her nothing he prayed for a woman like this sometimes that's what we need a little bit of courage go up to her if you've already prayed and you've already reached your requirements yes let me i pray they drink a little water of thy pitcher and she said drink my lord and she hates it let down her picture up upon her hand and gave me drink he gave him a drink also until they have done drinking water and ran again to the well to draw water and drew for all of his camels if the brother can put that image there for me i want to see what was a throw que quiero velo que es april she filled up that channel that throw there yeah you know yes okay put it in and put another one in there maybe she had like a gallon maybe two gallons i don't know what was the this this is between the whale and where the camels were okay they probably drink about 10 or 15 gallons each 20 gallons each pizzas come back and put it again come back and he was praying for certain characteristics come on brother don't do this to me no the young lady shouldn't be tired to come to church to show those characteristics a man amen well brother i i i don't the young lady should show the effort to come to church we want to amen amen on the 21st verse and the man wondering wandering at her held his peace to it whether the lord has made his journey prosperous or not prospered he just watched her god already showed her that she was the one god showed him but he's he's he just he just kept his peace he didn't say anything he just watched her el solomon this is god or it's not god i'm going to say it again you should wait or it's not god and they came to pass as the camels had done drinking two braces of her hands of 10 shekels of weight of gold we have both straw and provender enough in room to lodge in india to worship the lord will you see a young lady don't be afraid to talk about god don't be afraid to talk about brother branham if it makes him uncomfortable that's already a sign yeah that he's probably not the one if you talk about the lord with her and she doesn't want to come to church and it makes her uncomfortable that should already be assigned to you yes but you just can't jump and go and and just get married dude you have to pray you got to get ready well brother brother says he married a rich couple he married so [Laughter] [Applause] if you love her see you don't want to see her hungry no question if you love her see llamas you don't want to be struggling paying bills asking you're asking your father-in-law and your dad for help for money to sue amen amen you still love me ma'am man amen and 27 verses and he said blessed be the lord god of my master abraham destitute my master of his mercy and his truth in being the way the lord had led me to the house of my masters brethren to my clan and to my kindred ambition he was royalty he was a relative of abraham we should marry our own spiritual relatives amen ran and told them of her mother's house these things and said look for character element when he married the rich couple he married the poor couple money and good looks doesn't solve everything [Music] but it's character amen amen that's what brother bryan says i'd rather go with this character down here i'd rather have all the riches in the world and arguing all the time you're gonna be like wow one of us said wow lord why didn't you open my eyes it was the worst eyes i've ever seen in my life man amen but this you should be praying and praying you're praying until you get so sick of it until god answers now brother we're recording is it right for a christian man and woman to kiss one another and then write there and pray this is his brother says he said oh no sir no indeedy they said no sir you kiss one woman brother and that's your wife amen your child suica let me see if i got that right is it right for christian man and woman to kiss one another on greetings no sir no senor don't you ever get that started no sir no senor you keep away from women apart i'm gonna say that again you keep away from woman apart shine away from them exactly right now they're you're they're our sisters now they got the thing excuse me here that thing even got over to pentecost don't get anything like that stay away from it and i believe that you might be a good sanctified holy man i amen amen i don't care how clean you are no me importa you're my brother you might be a good sanctified holy man i don't care how holy you are you are still a man remember we spoke about that that that magnet this flesh it's right here you're never going to get rid of this until you die until our it's if i can't contain myself i should marry i don't care how holy she is what family she comes from don't make me no different oh she's the last name of this she's a renowned name family i don't care where she comes young men or young ladies hanging out alone holding hands hugging each other or much less kissing if a young man wants to do that to you you so that you older people will understand each human being male and female have a different type of gland carlos and those glands lay in human lips that's right correcto and here's another thing that might be brought up man kissing another in the mouth that's dirty that's why they greeted one another with the holy kiss they kissed on the neck and fell up and it fell upon their neck in case of another back of the neck that was they put their arms around one another and they kiss another on the back of the neck we shake hands with one another you got your arm around your brother and kiss him on the neck or he kisses you on the neck that's all right but don't you kiss that woman don't you let that woman kiss you you take her by the hand and say wait a minute mister just wait a minute when you see a car coming down the road 90 miles an hour get out of the way that's right when you see the first twist in anything like that get away from it stay away from it that's the ground you should not be on this satan will present you something that will wreck your soul satan will present you something that will wreck your soul and send you to hell stay away from it shun the very appearance of evil evita that's right be a man a man wouldn't go out of his place i'm sorry excuse me i lost my place she went a guy the man wanted to get out of his got out of his place if there's a bad woman but remember she can't be a bad woman without being a bad man a man can be bad unless there's a bad woman aren't you the one that's higher a stronger vessel as the bible says she's weaker he has mass death she's and other christians have done it you have more power amen this nature that we have is very tremendous and no one is except exempt from it if we notice joseph in the bible where joseph was bought by uh potiphar josef i remember how do you remember joseph in the bible he was sold by his brethren made it to egypt and this man he saw the jokes of everything that joseph did and she said joseph lie with me come with me i'm not going to do that how am i going to commit this wickedness and sin against god when that something's presented you should be a man of god and then she started to yell all over the house and say you see you look this is miraben we bring this this pedocyte into our house and now he was trying to be with me he stood for the word of god he stood for his principles he stood for his testimony nobody was watching him but he knew that god was watching he said how can i commit this wickedness you read in scripture you read his story but you've noticed even joseph jose he was presented with temptation but he stood with his principles stay away from them that's not right amen amen we're going to be closing pretty soon if you notice here that we get those anointments they come to [Applause] first corinthians chapter 6 verse 12. amen you love the lord here foster paul says all things are lawful onto me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but i will not be brought under the power of any [Applause] can i use this phone to to dig a hole i mean you can try but was it made for that pero aguero it's not for fornication but it's for the lord that's what's his body is foreign foreign and god has both raised up the lord and i will raise up raise up us by his own power so he raised up the lord amen calvary it was barry he was there in a too many he raised up the lord he raised up the lord from the dead and he will raise us also corinthians how can you raise up something that's not right no you're not that your bodies or the members of christ shall i then take the members of christ and put in the members of harlot so here aki do you have a body in our body we have many members if i commit fornication that only my member commit that sin or my whole body does it solamente the whole body if the members commit adultery and the whole body commits adultery the whole body is guilty but
