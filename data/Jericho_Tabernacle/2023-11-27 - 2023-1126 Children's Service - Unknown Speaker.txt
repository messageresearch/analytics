[Applause] bless you are you everybody hear me not yet can you hear can everyone hear me now amen how are we doing this evening is everyone feeling good I can feel the expectation rising from everybody's faces they're really uh expecting to receive something from the Lord and uh the youth and as well brother maros Saragosa and brother maros Santana have been uh putting in a lot of effort to prepare this play for you and uh it was a blessing for me just watching it and I believe it will be a blessing for you uh the whole theme about this play is basically Prayer Changes Things and there's a story in the Bible that speaks of a shunamite woman in the book of 2 Kings chapter 4 who wanted a son and by the grace of the Lord the Lord granted her to be able to have a son but then that son passed away but then the Lord sent Elisha again to bring that child back to life now we know that's a Bible that's in uh that's in ancient history that's a story that's a part of history but now uh we know that God is still a god of Eternity that what he did in the past he can do today presently as well he's the same yesterday today and forever so what he did in the past he can still to uh do today because he's still the Eternal God so there was a story during our time during our prophet's time that he uh one day had to go pray for a boy who was dying and we know the story it was uh the story of when he had to to land his plane in an emergency landing because he there was a storm and then he uh God led him to a house where there was a woman who uh she compared herself to the shunamite woman if you remember the story and she called herself the Ana so uh basically we want to give you a play that shows a little bit of backstory of what happened to the child in the Bible but then modernize it and show how that applies to today so we have different scenes biblically and and then different scenes of how that child uh during brother brandom's time had to grow up and had to face the different influences if you remember when brother Bram talks about the the story he says that that child got with the wrong company so we're just showing different parts of that child's life how he uh got with the wrong company and that led him to be in that dying condition and so we're just going to show different plays about that so if uh you can pray for us and I I I know it's going to be a blessing it'll be a blessing for me as well amen and you may be seated Brothers God bless you for 2 Kings 4: 11-2 and also verses 14- 22 one day Elisha returned to Schuman and he went up up to this Upper Room to rest he said to his servant gahaz tell the woman from Schuman I want to speak to her when she appeared later Elisha asked gazi what can we do for her gahaz replied she doesn't have a son and her husband is an old man call her back again Elisha told him when the woman returned Elisha said to her as soon as she stood in the doorway next year at this time you will be holding the son in your arms no my Lord she cried oh man of God don't deceive me and get my hopes up like that but sure enough the woman soon became pregnant and at that time the following year she had a son just as Elijah had said one day when her child was older he went out to help his father who was working with the Harvesters suddenly he cried out my head hurts my head hurts his father said to one of the servants carry him home to his mother so the servant took him home and his mother held him on her lap but around noon time he died she carried him up and laid him on the bed on the man of of God then shut the door and left him there she sent a message to her husband send me one of the servants and a donkey so that I can hurry to Elisha the man of God and come right back Lord my son why Lord why Lord you you made a promise to me through your Prophet Elijah Lord why my son Lord my son Lord Lord why my son Lord why there's a story in the Bible of Elish woman and her son the woman found favor with God and he gave her a [Music] son while in the Feld [Music] Bo all is well all is well all is well we have heard the message all [Music] it there is a place of perfect rest behind rest rest [Music] for 4: 32-37 when Elisha arrived the child was indeed dead lying there on the prophet's bed he went in alone and shut the door behind him and prayed to the Lord then he laid down on the child's bodies his eyes on his on the child's eyes and his hands on the child child's hands and as he stretched out on him the child's body began to grow warm again Elisha got up walked back and forth across the room once and then he stretched himself out again on the child this time the boy sneezed and opened his eyes and Elisha summon gazi call the child's mother he said and and when she came in Elisha said here take your son she fell at his feet and bowed before him overwhelmed with gratitude then she took her son in her arms and carried him downstairs [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

we are approaching a major storm in our path please fasten your seat belts and secure all items under your seats we will be having an emergency landing in the city of Memphis Tennessee we know you have many airlines to choose from so we thank you for choosing Northeast Airlines we thank you all for your cooperation and you all have a good refund thank you and have a great evening as we land to Memphis Tennessee was coming from Dallas Texas and we got in a storm and the plane was forced to land at Memphis Tennessee and they told us the storm would be most of the night that they'd call us the next morning and they put us up in that great famous hotel Peabody Hotel I didn't even know how to act in it we went up went to bed I wrote some letters and the next morning they called us and he said the limousine would pick us up at 7:00 down the street and all of a sudden something said stop a minute you know what I speak of stop just a minute well I thought that was just I just thought that I kept on going I got across the street and the big Irish cop looked at me because it walked across on a red light and so then I got up like was was looking in a store like this and I had these letters in my pocket to mail and I looked and there was a mailbox on the corner so mail the letters and something said just keep walking well I thought I better get back I started this way I couldn't go did you ever have that feeling I started again I couldn't do it so I turned and went walking this way something said just keep walking walking on I went walking on down first thing you know I come over into the side of the river part there I found myself down in a little color District bunch of little shadies all the sun was high I looked at my watch was was already 7:30 I was then good two miles from a hotel but something just kept saying walk and I started singing that little song that you Pentecostal people sing uh people almost everywhere whose hearts are all of flame with the power that fell on Pentecost that cleans and made them clean oh it's burning now within my heart Oh Glory to his name I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them you know that song I just heard him saying it and I was humminging and I looked at a little old shack there and a leaning across the gate was a very typical old A J Mami she had a man's shirt tied around her head great big fat cheeks I was about 40 yards from her I was humming that song and I just quit humming it passed on by not knowing oh it was a beautiful morning morning after the storm the Roses the honeysuckles the fragrance just just bursting into the air and I was singing in the spirit as I moved along and this old colored woman when I passed by she said good morning Pon now a minister in the South and then I can say I'm one of them oh one of them I'm one of [Music] them oh one of them I'm one of them and I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them good morning oh good morning Auntie how' you know I was a person I known you was coming and how did you know I was coming did you ever a read in the Bible about that shunamite woman well I sure have I is that kind of woman I promised the Lord that if he gave me a son I would raise him to in the God's glory the lord gave me a fine boy but Parson he's got with the wrong company and he caught some social disease doctor said there's nothing we can do for him he's in the other room dying I can't stand to see my baby die in these conditions I prayed to the Lord all last night and at 2:00 this morning I fell asleep I dreamed I was talking to the Lord and said you gave me this baby like the shamonite woman but where is my Elisha Lord told me look and I seen a man wearing a tan suit and a tan hat just like yours it was you Parson I've been standing here at the gate waiting for you God's work on both ends well Auntie my name is brandham have you ever heard of me no sir Parson brandham I never heard of you well I pray for the sick when I went to that house no rug on the floor and little old iron bed bed Steed and a great big huge black boy laying there about 180 lbs about 6t tall I looked around that little old house and little old stove sitting there one of those little step stoves and a sign on the side of the wall saying God bless our home but never did I feel any more welcome than I did in that little negro Shack that morning because God was there and as I walked in that big boy was laying there pson he hasn't spoken a word in days he's dying well why don't we pray let us pray and I thought that poor fellow I fell of his feet just as stiff and icy as they could be and she said begin to pray and oh my you talk about a prayer that old black woman rendered a prayer to God that would make the hardest heart cry I stood there and just bathed in the beauty of God while she was praying now will you pray Parson yes of course oh Lord heavenly father I just don't know why you L me down here this little Shack Lord but maybe it's just a place but Lord I can feel your presence here this morning Lord and I know that Lord I just can't understand but I just pray you help this poor little dear saint of yours who stood Faithfully Lord Lord I just ask you to help her Lord and spare the life of this young man right here Lord Mama yes honey what does mama's baby want mama I can't see a lie that shows love though he would disgrace her home though he was dying in sin and and disgraced with the venal disease yet that Mother's Love still regarded him as her baby then think about the grace of God and less than 5 minutes time that big boy was sitting on the side of the bed giving glory to God talk about Sovereign Grace the faith of that ignorant colored woman grounded that plane and it held it there my when I think of those things and the many I've seen I think how rich how pure how fathomless and strong the love of God is for a poor insignificant peasant ignorant colored woman but her prayers grounded that plane and held it there and sent me down there to pray for that [Applause] boy how many enjoyed the play and how many other children understood what happened to that boy that if you get with the wrong wrong company eventually it can lead you to a dark condition and something amazing that struck me about uh this play and the things that brother Brandon says about it is that so quickly the condition of that boy changed he said that first of all the boy said that he felt that he was in a dark place he said it was in the ocean rowing his boow and that he was in a dark place but after brother randam said he said within five minutes he said he could see the light and and he was praising God so that's how quickly things can change when you pray because Prayer Changes Things amen and so one of the things that I was thinking about that struck me when I was hearing brother brandham and I was watching them practice for the play was something that brother vom says about that boy he says that that boy was in that condition lying and that for some reason he says that he felt that he was out in the ocean on a little boat rowing his boat and he said that it was dark out outside and for some reason I kept thinking there has to be a reason for that there has to be a reason why him in that dying sinful condition God has him out in the ocean alone at dark and then I started thinking myself how one time our lord Jesus when he was here on the earth he sent his own disciples out onto the ocean by themselves and the Bible says that at evening time Jesus went out to a mountain to pray but his disciples were already out in the water and the Bible says that around the hour 3: to 6 in the morning that's when the waves started rocking the boat the winds begin to pick up pace and begin to go stronger and began to rock that boat now one thing that brother Ram says is that Jesus always appears at the darkest hour so does anyone know what the darkest hour of the day is it's in the morning time between 3 and 6:00 in the morning so Jesus literally with his own disciples appeared at the darkest point of the day because what brother random says that's the truth Jesus always comes at the darkest hour but just at its darkest then when Jesus comes he's the son of righteousness so that's exactly what happened with this boy he was in a dark condition just like the disciples but then Jesus came and quickly everything changed so what must we do we when we are in our darkest moments we must pray to the Lord because Prayer Changes Things and it can change it so quickly within five minutes like it did for the disciples and like it did for this uh woman with her boy amen so if we can please stand we're going to welcome the musicians and the song leader we're going to Worship the Lord [Music] above all and all above all in all
