[1:04:43] [Music]
[1:04:48] amen and just as you are let's go to the
[1:04:50] Book of
[1:04:52] Daniel the fifth chapter
[1:04:58] and verse
[1:04:59] [Music]
[1:05:07] 24 you can say Amen once you have
[1:05:09] [Music]
[1:05:16] it then was a part of the hand sent from
[1:05:19] him and this writing was
[1:05:21] [Music]
[1:05:23] written
[1:05:26] and this and this is the writing that
[1:05:28] was written
[1:05:30] [Music]
[1:05:37] menen this is the interpretation of the
[1:05:39] thing men God hath numbered thy kingdom
[1:05:42] and finished
[1:05:47] it Thou Art weighed in the balances and
[1:05:50] and are found
[1:05:53] wanting
[1:05:57] perz thy kingdom is divided and given
[1:05:59] unto the mees and
[1:06:10] Persians then commanded basar and they
[1:06:13] clothed Daniel with scarlet and put a
[1:06:15] chain of gold about his neck and made a
[1:06:17] proclamation concerning him that he
[1:06:19] should be the third ruler in the
[1:06:23] Kingdom
[1:06:25] and that night was basar the king of the
[1:06:27] Chan
[1:06:33] slain median took the kingdom being
[1:06:36] about three score and two years
[1:06:39] old God bless the reading of his word if
[1:06:42] you may you could take your
[1:06:44] seats like to thank the
[1:06:47] [Music]
[1:06:53] musicians
[1:06:55] now the scripture that we just finished
[1:06:59] reading it was in that period of
[1:07:03] time in that uh Babylonian
[1:07:11] Empire and knew this prophecy came
[1:07:13] against that uh Babylonian
[1:07:18] Empire and it says that Kingdom has gone
[1:07:20] has come to an
[1:07:22] end and a new kingdom was the Usher
[1:07:26] in and which was the med
[1:07:32] Persians we know that if something is
[1:07:34] written in the Bible and it's for a
[1:07:38] reason it's not just the history
[1:07:41] book it's a a book of
[1:07:44] Prophecy now brother Bram
[1:07:47] says in the the message the handwriting
[1:07:49] on the
[1:07:52] wall it says now and any Bible reader
[1:07:58] here knows that all scripture has a com
[1:08:01] compound
[1:08:02] meaning every
[1:08:10] prophecy some most all of it has a dual
[1:08:13] a dual time there or two times or more
[1:08:16] that it will be
[1:08:19] answered as a revolving of
[1:08:22] History so we know if it's in the
[1:08:26] Bible and US reading the
[1:08:30] Bible it seems like if it happened in
[1:08:33] the
[1:08:34] past and it will no longer happen
[1:08:37] again but God's word is
[1:08:40] eternal so as time
[1:08:43] continues like if like just as Spirits
[1:08:45] don't
[1:08:46] die and the time
[1:08:50] continues the same spirits of the
[1:08:52] past
[1:08:54] are working in
[1:08:56] today but with a new
[1:08:59] name the the the men of the
[1:09:04] Bible they saw things ahead or in the
[1:09:08] future they had visions of the future
[1:09:10] and the
[1:09:13] past but when he speaks about these
[1:09:15] kingdoms of the
[1:09:18] future they have to use
[1:09:20] names that they know in their time
[1:09:25] to describe the kingdoms of the
[1:09:28] future when he speaks about
[1:09:30] Babylon and the medal
[1:09:35] Persians it can be talking about what
[1:09:37] happened in the
[1:09:40] past but also speak of what's going to
[1:09:42] happen in the
[1:09:45] future so brother
[1:09:48] Bram and another message the handwriting
[1:09:50] of the
[1:09:51] wall paragraph 50
[1:09:56] and they sent and got Daniel the Prophet
[1:09:59] and he came
[1:10:01] in and he said he would read
[1:10:05] it for he had the gift of
[1:10:10] interpretation so he began to interpret
[1:10:12] the unknown
[1:10:14] tongue and told the king what was going
[1:10:16] to
[1:10:19] happen the king thought he was safely
[1:10:22] secured
[1:10:25] but he didn't know all that all the
[1:10:29] time he says a Godless Nation like
[1:10:35] Russia now remember the prophet was not
[1:10:37] in the med of
[1:10:38] Persia he was in
[1:10:43] Babylon the big rock and roll was going
[1:10:46] on in
[1:10:49] Babylon where the Revival was going on
[1:10:52] too
[1:10:55] where the Prophet was and the message
[1:10:57] was but all the
[1:11:01] time now notice the comparison that
[1:11:03] brother random
[1:11:04] makes says the mes and
[1:11:10] Persians are just as Godless and
[1:11:12] heartless as Russia
[1:11:15] is had found a
[1:11:18] way because Spirits don't
[1:11:21] die and story and the history repeats
[1:11:26] itself in the message the serpent
[1:11:31] seed that's the reason God has raised up
[1:11:36] Russia Yonder with an atomic bomb to
[1:11:38] wipe her
[1:11:41] off like the anti luian flood
[1:11:44] was when he raised the
[1:11:47] clouds sure he
[1:11:50] has and the Bible says so says
[1:11:55] Russia the athetic country as they
[1:11:59] are
[1:12:04] atheist has absolutely playing just
[1:12:07] exactly in the hands of of almighty
[1:12:11] God just as King
[1:12:16] Nebuchadnezzar was to destroy Israel
[1:12:18] because they have failed to walk with
[1:12:22] God say Russia is rising right
[1:12:27] up to avenge the Saints of the Catholic
[1:12:32] Church of the blood that she sh shed of
[1:12:35] the
[1:12:36] Saints the Bible said
[1:12:38] so it's going to take the whole
[1:12:42] thing just like Spirits don't
[1:12:46] die those same spirits that was used in
[1:12:48] the
[1:12:49] past in the kingdoms of
[1:12:52] old are being used in this
[1:12:55] time but now they have a new
[1:12:58] name but when the Bible speaks of
[1:13:02] it but those new names didn't exist in
[1:13:04] that
[1:13:07] time they have to know the names of
[1:13:09] their present time so
[1:13:13] Russia are the M of
[1:13:15] Persia it's the same Spirit but with a
[1:13:18] new
[1:13:20] name now the Roman Catholic Church is
[1:13:24] it's
[1:13:25] Babylon but now with a new
[1:13:27] name but with the same
[1:13:30] Spirit the spirits don't
[1:13:33] die and prophecy is being fulfilled
[1:13:35] multiple
[1:13:38] times now in Jeremiah
[1:13:52] 51:11
[1:13:56] make bright the arrows GA gather the
[1:13:58] shields the Lord hath raised up thy
[1:14:00] Spirit of the kings of the mes for his
[1:14:02] device is against Babylon to destroy
[1:14:04] because it is Vengeance of the Lord the
[1:14:06] Vengeance of his
[1:14:07] temple one would
[1:14:12] think that that Jeremiah speak about the
[1:14:14] literal
[1:14:17] Babylon what they did against
[1:14:21] Israel God is he will raise up the
[1:14:24] spirits of the of the mids of
[1:14:27] Persia to destroy
[1:14:31] Babylon when Babylon literally went to
[1:14:34] Israel they destroyed the
[1:14:37] temple he said he will get his
[1:14:41] Vengeance for what they did to his
[1:14:45] Temple but the scripture gets fulfilled
[1:14:47] multiple
[1:14:52] times
[1:14:54] now we all
[1:14:56] know we can see throughout the
[1:14:59] Bible where God
[1:15:02] is the devil wants to get
[1:15:06] in where God blesses a person or a
[1:15:10] people or a
[1:15:13] nation the devil wants to get
[1:15:16] in and he establish his own
[1:15:21] kingdom and something that did before
[1:15:23] the foundation of the
[1:15:26] world in Isaiah
[1:15:36] 14:12 how art thou falling from Heaven
[1:15:39] Lu first son of the morning how art thou
[1:15:41] cut down to the ground which did is
[1:15:42] weaken the
[1:15:44] Nations you see how he weakens the
[1:15:47] Nations now verse
[1:15:50] 13 for for thou has said in thine
[1:15:54] heart I will Ascend into
[1:15:57] heaven I will
[1:16:00] exalt my throne above the stars of
[1:16:06] God I will I will sit also upon the
[1:16:09] mountain of the congregation in the
[1:16:11] sides of the
[1:16:13] north where God is the devil wants to
[1:16:17] get
[1:16:19] in so the devil in that
[1:16:22] time
[1:16:24] he caused a
[1:16:26] revolution in the Kingdom that was found
[1:16:28] in the
[1:16:31] north because brother says the message
[1:16:33] the faith of
[1:16:38] Abraham so all this here pretty and
[1:16:41] beauty stuff that comes from the
[1:16:43] devil that's exactly
[1:16:50] right Satan won a more glamorous Kingdom
[1:16:53] than
[1:16:57] Michael and that's the reason he set up
[1:16:59] his kingdom in the
[1:17:02] north so the kingdom that was in the
[1:17:05] north it was about it was
[1:17:08] Michaels one would think why
[1:17:11] Michael now look
[1:17:14] Michael in the book of
[1:17:16] Jude he speaks that he's an
[1:17:19] archangel but in the Book of
[1:17:22] Daniel it speaks about
[1:17:24] Michael as a
[1:17:27] prince now we know that Michael is an
[1:17:30] angel just like the
[1:17:33] devil and all the rest of these spirits
[1:17:35] that control the
[1:17:37] Nations but there's different ranks in
[1:17:40] the spirits one of
[1:17:42] them is of a
[1:17:47] prince and a prince has a certain
[1:17:49] Kingdom assigned to
[1:17:51] him and should control that
[1:17:55] Kingdom if you go to the Book of
[1:17:58] Daniel where where brother Daniel was
[1:18:00] once
[1:18:03] praying and he had to pray for 21
[1:18:07] days and he want to know things that
[1:18:09] were going to happen in the
[1:18:11] future and things that were going to
[1:18:13] happen to his own
[1:18:15] people after the 21 days gabri the
[1:18:19] Gabriel the angel Gabriel he appears
[1:18:24] him he said look I have rested for 21
[1:18:27] days or I waited 21
[1:18:31] days because I was fighting the Prince
[1:18:33] of
[1:18:37] Persia and one of those main
[1:18:40] uh uhp uh Kings orp prince prince Miguel
[1:18:47] he says Michael he came to help
[1:18:51] me
[1:18:53] and after I fought the king of the the
[1:18:55] Prince of
[1:18:57] Persia I have to fight against the
[1:18:59] prince of Greece now these are
[1:19:03] spirits now Michael is a
[1:19:06] prince that's why he has a
[1:19:10] Terrain he has a kingdom that was
[1:19:12] assigned appointed to him and God gave
[1:19:15] him that
[1:19:18] Kingdom Satan wants to get
[1:19:21] in where God people is
[1:19:24] at where God blesses
[1:19:27] something Satan went to the the kings of
[1:19:30] of the
[1:19:31] north and brother Braham
[1:19:33] says he established his
[1:19:36] kingdom there in the north
[1:19:39] also he brought forth a
[1:19:41] revolution a
[1:19:44] rebellion against the kingdom of
[1:19:47] Michael and infiltrating
[1:19:50] himself and preaching to the Stars
[1:19:55] that represents the Seed of
[1:19:59] Abraham and it caused one of those stars
[1:20:02] or some of those stars to come with
[1:20:07] him now that's what the devil did he got
[1:20:10] into the
[1:20:12] kingdom he began to speak a contrary
[1:20:16] message and he took some of
[1:20:20] them he caused
[1:20:23] he caused a Civil War in
[1:20:31] heaven now in Revelations 12
[1:20:44] 1-5 and there appeared a great Wonder in
[1:20:46] heaven a woman clothed with the sun and
[1:20:48] the moon under her feet and upon her
[1:20:50] head a crown of 12
[1:20:51] Stars
[1:20:58] and she being with child cry travailing
[1:21:00] in birth and pain to be
[1:21:10] delivered and there appeared another
[1:21:12] Wonder in heaven and behold a great red
[1:21:13] dragon having seven heads and 10 horns
[1:21:16] and seven crowns upon his
[1:21:21] heads
[1:21:31] and his tail drew the third part of the
[1:21:33] stars of heaven and did cast them to the
[1:21:35] earth and the dragon stood before the
[1:21:36] woman which was ready to be delivered
[1:21:38] for to devour her child as soon as it
[1:21:40] was
[1:21:42] born remember his story history repeats
[1:21:46] itself that the Bible is not a book of
[1:21:49] History it's a book of
[1:21:51] Prophecy what happened in the past and
[1:21:55] it continues again it happens
[1:21:58] again so what the devil did in
[1:22:01] heaven here is talking about what he did
[1:22:03] in
[1:22:05] heaven but it also speaks what he's
[1:22:07] doing here on
[1:22:09] Earth verse
[1:22:18] five and she brought forth a Manchild
[1:22:20] who was to rule all nations with a rod
[1:22:22] of iron and her child was caught up onto
[1:22:24] God and to his
[1:22:27] throne what would
[1:22:29] think since it speaks about the dragon
[1:22:32] and the stars of
[1:22:34] Heaven it speaks about what he did there
[1:22:36] in
[1:22:38] heaven but it also speaks what he did
[1:22:40] here on
[1:22:43] Earth notice what brother Ram says here
[1:22:45] questions and answers law having a
[1:22:50] shadow now you say the dragon had has
[1:22:52] something to do with the Jews
[1:22:58] certainly they said this Jesus says he's
[1:23:00] the
[1:23:02] king we have no King but
[1:23:07] Caesar so when the devil went to
[1:23:10] heaven to the sides of the
[1:23:13] north he caused a rebellion leader
[1:23:17] against their leader in in
[1:23:20] Earth in is there in
[1:23:26] Israel Satan got there among some of the
[1:23:30] Jews so they can stir up a
[1:23:33] rebellion against their
[1:23:36] Messiah what he did up there he does it
[1:23:39] again here on
[1:23:46] Earth he says can you see the devil
[1:23:48] denying Hearts
[1:23:51] today excuse me that's right you see the
[1:23:53] devil preparing them Jewish Hearts back
[1:23:54] there to deny Jesus Christ when he
[1:23:58] come can you see the devil denying the
[1:24:00] hearts
[1:24:02] today to deny the power of the Holy
[1:24:04] Ghost when he
[1:24:07] comes just exactly the
[1:24:10] same yet honest and
[1:24:13] sincere but if you're
[1:24:16] deeply and seek after
[1:24:19] God like some of them Jews did
[1:24:25] they walked right out and received him
[1:24:29] anyhow that's right they didn't care
[1:24:31] what the church
[1:24:34] said but it cast twoth thirds of them on
[1:24:37] onto the
[1:24:42] ground and the dragon stood before the
[1:24:44] woman to devour her child as soon as it
[1:24:46] was
[1:24:49] born he says now he said what government
[1:24:51] what power
[1:24:55] stood before the woman the Jewish
[1:24:57] Orthodox
[1:24:59] Church to devour Jesus Christ when he
[1:25:02] was born
[1:25:05] Rome so the red dragon was
[1:25:11] Rome the
[1:25:13] devil he caused a
[1:25:16] revolution in the system of the the
[1:25:18] government
[1:25:20] system to go against their leader
[1:25:24] the history repeats itself lucif
[1:25:28] Lucifer went to
[1:25:32] heaven and caused a
[1:25:36] revolution amongst the
[1:25:39] angels to stand against Michael their
[1:25:43] leader and did the same thing here on
[1:25:46] Earth when Jesus Christ
[1:25:51] came
[1:25:54] now remember what we read on Jeremiah
[1:25:59] 511 he was going to rise up the spirit
[1:26:01] of the medal
[1:26:02] Persians against
[1:26:05] Babylon and get Vengeance of his
[1:26:09] temple one would think it would be the
[1:26:10] literal
[1:26:13] Temple but John in
[1:26:21] 2:19 Jesus answered said unto them
[1:26:23] destroy this Temple and in three days I
[1:26:25] will raise it
[1:26:32] up then said the Jews 40 in six years
[1:26:35] was a temple in the building and will
[1:26:36] thou read it up in the three
[1:26:41] days but he spake of the Temple of his
[1:26:48] body now it's the spirit of the medal
[1:26:51] Persians
[1:26:52] that will get back the
[1:26:54] Vengeance that God will
[1:26:57] use to get this Vengeance against
[1:27:00] Babylon now Babylon today has a new
[1:27:04] name now that is a Roman Catholic
[1:27:09] church so the med Persians
[1:27:11] today they also have a new name that is
[1:27:16] Russia but it's the same
[1:27:20] Spirit let's see what brother Ram says
[1:27:21] about
[1:27:26] Ria we have seen his star in the message
[1:27:29] we have seen his star and we have come
[1:27:30] to worship
[1:27:33] him why is why is communism
[1:27:38] coming why is the world being swallowed
[1:27:43] up why could 1% of
[1:27:47] Russia that all is
[1:27:51] communism 99% is still
[1:27:55] Christian 1% of
[1:28:00] Russia controlling the rest of the world
[1:28:02] almost the Eastern
[1:28:05] world so Russia has two
[1:28:09] parts it has
[1:28:11] 1% that is
[1:28:14] communist and another part another
[1:28:16] person of the mess says they're
[1:28:17] atheists they have no
[1:28:21] God remember the medal
[1:28:23] Persians they they are that bear a
[1:28:27] bear it's a it's a it's a anim
[1:28:34] beast but the
[1:28:37] bear it's that
[1:28:39] 1% it's communist it's
[1:28:43] atheist what
[1:28:46] animal represents the
[1:28:50] 99% that is Christian brother Bram
[1:28:54] said in the message go awake
[1:29:00] Jesus that's what caused communism to
[1:29:02] raise up in
[1:29:05] Russia well the Communist is not a great
[1:29:11] party there's only 1% of Russia is
[1:29:13] communism now
[1:29:18] 1% 99% is still free
[1:29:23] but they're they're
[1:29:25] ruling they're the ones
[1:29:28] ruling why did raised up in the first
[1:29:32] place because the corruption of the
[1:29:36] church that's what done
[1:29:39] it it's talking about the Catholic
[1:29:42] Church they took all the money from the
[1:29:45] people to the
[1:29:49] church and they live the same kinds of
[1:29:51] lives
[1:29:55] they they wasn't no more but just like
[1:29:57] any other
[1:30:01] Lodge and the people got sick and tired
[1:30:03] of it and that's how communism was
[1:30:06] born we see that the prophet tells
[1:30:09] us that
[1:30:10] 1% is
[1:30:13] communist and the rest of the 99 is is
[1:30:16] uh
[1:30:17] Christian how is it that
[1:30:20] 1% can rule or govern the
[1:30:24] 99 because it's
[1:30:27] communist in other words it's a
[1:30:31] dictatorship that's what's in the
[1:30:34] government controlling the
[1:30:38] citizens that's why that 1% can control
[1:30:41] that
[1:30:42] 99 that's that uh SP Spirit of
[1:30:45] communist but the Christian
[1:30:47] Spirit the spirit of
[1:30:50] Christ he leaves the 99
[1:30:53] sheep and he goes for that one sheep
[1:30:55] that got
[1:30:58] lost so that
[1:31:01] 1% it's that
[1:31:04] bear that's that that
[1:31:07] Beast that
[1:31:09] atheist has wants nothing to do with
[1:31:13] religion but the 99 it's
[1:31:17] Christian so what
[1:31:20] animal represents the Christian side of
[1:31:23] the medal
[1:31:25] Persians the Bible tells us in Daniel
[1:31:28] 8 verse
[1:31:41] one in the third year the region of the
[1:31:43] king belar a vision appeared onto me
[1:31:46] even unto me Daniel after that which
[1:31:48] appeared unto me at
[1:31:50] first
[1:31:54] now remember this is under the reign of
[1:31:56] king belthasar
[1:31:57] a king of
[1:32:00] Babylon so this was before the medial
[1:32:04] Persians verse
[1:32:15] two and I saw in a vision and it came to
[1:32:17] pass when I saw that I was in shushan in
[1:32:19] the palace which in the province of Elam
[1:32:22] and I saw in a vision and I was by the
[1:32:24] river of
[1:32:32] uali then I lifted up my eyes and I saw
[1:32:35] behold there stood before the river a
[1:32:37] ram which had two
[1:32:41] horns now brother say there's two parts
[1:32:43] in
[1:32:45] Russia it say
[1:32:47] 1% and there's the
[1:32:49] 99% the bear
[1:32:53] we we just finished reading that there
[1:32:54] is a
[1:32:55] ram that has two
[1:33:03] horns and the two horns were high but
[1:33:05] one was higher than the other and the
[1:33:07] higher came up
[1:33:09] last so it has two
[1:33:12] horns but one is higher than the
[1:33:15] other there's two parts in the metop
[1:33:18] Persians but One controls the other
[1:33:22] can you see
[1:33:24] that verse
[1:33:41] four and I saw the ram pushing Westward
[1:33:44] and northward and Southward so that no
[1:33:46] Beast might stand before him neither was
[1:33:48] there any that could deliver out of his
[1:33:50] hand but he hid he he did according to
[1:33:52] his will and became
[1:33:55] great so he's expanding his kingdom
[1:33:58] here verse
[1:34:06] 20 the ram which thou sawest having two
[1:34:08] horns are the kings of media and
[1:34:13] Persia so we can see what brother Bram
[1:34:15] tells
[1:34:16] us that the country of today that is
[1:34:19] called
[1:34:20] Russia that has two
[1:34:23] parts that is founded in the
[1:34:27] Bible because Russia has a spirit of the
[1:34:29] medal
[1:34:31] Persians and the medal Persian has two
[1:34:34] portions that one part is higher than
[1:34:36] the
[1:34:42] other in the message I restore sayith
[1:34:45] the
[1:34:47] Lord and then he said put me seven
[1:34:49] rounds on here
[1:34:52] what do the ram speak
[1:34:58] of any religious teacher know that the
[1:35:00] ram spoke of the coming of the Lord
[1:35:05] Jesus we can see that the
[1:35:07] bear it's the atheist the Communist and
[1:35:11] the ram is the
[1:35:13] Christian there's two
[1:35:20] parts
[1:35:26] and he says that he will get the
[1:35:28] Vengeance of his
[1:35:30] Temple we saw that the Vengeance of the
[1:35:33] temple the temple it was his
[1:35:37] body now brother Ram was to
[1:35:41] say that the med Persians or
[1:35:44] Russia is divided in two parts one is
[1:35:48] communist the other is is Beast
[1:35:52] is other one is
[1:35:54] Christian we have to see that in the
[1:35:57] Bible and the Bible does show us in
[1:36:00] Daniel
[1:36:04] 6 how many remember when Daniel was cost
[1:36:07] was cast to the lines
[1:36:09] Den What
[1:36:12] Spirit What Spirit was it
[1:36:16] used to cast Daniel to the Lion's Den
[1:36:20] was it the bear or was it the
[1:36:22] ram the Christian side or the atheist
[1:36:26] side the
[1:36:28] Communist that abuses the power of the
[1:36:32] government let's go to Daniel
[1:36:41] 61 it pleased Darius to set over the
[1:36:43] kingdom and 120 princes which should be
[1:36:46] over the whole
[1:36:50] Kingdom
[1:36:57] and over these three presidents of whom
[1:36:58] Daniel was first that the princes might
[1:37:00] give account count onto them and the
[1:37:02] King should have no
[1:37:05] damage now Daniel besides being
[1:37:09] Christian he was in the
[1:37:11] government he was a man of
[1:37:15] government
[1:37:20] verse
[1:37:26] then this Daniel was preferred above the
[1:37:29] presidents and princes because an
[1:37:31] excellent Spirit was in him and the King
[1:37:34] thought to set him over the whole
[1:37:38] realm now what Spirit was in this King
[1:37:42] the bear the
[1:37:44] atheist
[1:37:45] communist or the ram the
[1:37:50] Christian
[1:37:54] but in verse
[1:37:56] four we can see the other side of that
[1:38:13] Kingdom then the president and princes
[1:38:15] sought to find occasion against Daniel
[1:38:18] concerning the kingdom but they could
[1:38:19] not they could find none occas nor fault
[1:38:21] for as much as he was faithful neither
[1:38:24] was there any error or fault found in
[1:38:35] him then said these men we shall not
[1:38:37] find any occasion against this Daniel
[1:38:39] except we find it against him concerning
[1:38:41] the law of his
[1:38:49] God then these presidents and princes
[1:38:52] assembled together to the king and said
[1:38:53] unto unto him King Darius live
[1:39:14] forever all the president of the Kingdom
[1:39:16] the governors and the princes the
[1:39:17] counselors and the captains have
[1:39:19] consulted together to establish Royal
[1:39:21] statue and to make a firm decree that
[1:39:23] whosoever shall ask a petition of any
[1:39:26] God or man for 30 days save of thee O
[1:39:29] King he shall be cast into the den of
[1:39:31] the
[1:39:33] Lions so what
[1:39:35] Spirit was in the
[1:39:37] king the bear or the RAM and what
[1:39:43] Spirit control these other
[1:39:46] men they wanted to accuse
[1:39:50] Daniel because that medal
[1:39:52] Persians is divided in two
[1:39:55] portions that's the bear and the ram the
[1:39:58] Communist The Atheist and the
[1:40:02] Christian
[1:40:05] amen so it was a communist
[1:40:09] spirit that entered in these
[1:40:13] men to use and abuse the power of the
[1:40:17] government to go against Daniel to kill
[1:40:25] him but the Christian
[1:40:28] spirit and this
[1:40:31] King he loved
[1:40:34] Daniel in Daniel
[1:40:48] 6:16 then the king commanded and they
[1:40:50] brought down Daniel and cast him into
[1:40:52] the into the den of the Lions now the
[1:40:54] king spake and said unto Daniel Thy Thy
[1:40:56] God whom thou servest continually he
[1:40:58] will deliver
[1:41:00] thee so these men spoke so
[1:41:05] good that the king legally could do
[1:41:07] nothing for
[1:41:19] Daniel and a stone was brought and laid
[1:41:22] upon the mouth of the den and the King
[1:41:24] sealed it with his own signate and with
[1:41:26] the sign of the Lords that the purpose
[1:41:27] might not be changed concerning
[1:41:30] Daniel so these were men of the
[1:41:32] government
[1:41:35] communist that spoke against
[1:41:39] Daniel and they abused their government
[1:41:43] power to deceive the
[1:41:46] king So Daniel can be
[1:41:48] killed and be cast into the line
[1:41:52] den and the Bible says when he was cast
[1:41:55] there and there was a stone there on top
[1:41:57] of the den to seal
[1:42:01] it same thing with Jesus when they spoke
[1:42:03] against
[1:42:06] him and they took him to the
[1:42:09] tomb and they sealed that tomb with a
[1:42:16] stone and in fact I have a testimony
[1:42:18] about
[1:42:19] this me and this
[1:42:23] message I preached it months
[1:42:26] ago where brother Jesus Garcia magdala
[1:42:29] they in in Magdalena in Mex in
[1:42:35] Mexico in that occasion brother Jesse
[1:42:37] Alan went with
[1:42:39] me and brother Jesus asked for me to
[1:42:42] speak and I had this topic in my
[1:42:46] heart but I wasn't so sure if I was to
[1:42:48] speak it or not I was doubting itess and
[1:42:52] I I I shared it with
[1:42:55] Jesse and Jesse said well yeah you
[1:42:57] should you should speak
[1:42:58] it I said okay that's
[1:43:01] good but I wasn't completely
[1:43:04] convinced that that should be the the
[1:43:06] the
[1:43:07] topic but I decided to do
[1:43:11] so when I got there to
[1:43:14] Magdalena brother
[1:43:16] Jes he took me and Jesse to a cemetery
[1:43:25] when he took us there to that Cemetery
[1:43:27] he took us to this place called like a
[1:43:30] mum how many know what a mum
[1:43:34] is it's it's a a grave side where they
[1:43:37] bury the rich
[1:43:42] people and what got my attention of this
[1:43:46] mum this this this man was a a
[1:43:49] politician
[1:43:52] in fact he was elected to be
[1:43:57] president and he was waiting for that
[1:43:59] president in that current
[1:44:01] time for his his his uh uh time to his
[1:44:05] term to
[1:44:06] end and he was going to be the next
[1:44:10] president for all I know he was elected
[1:44:13] to be
[1:44:14] president and this man was a lot like
[1:44:17] Daniel in the
[1:44:19] Bible what I searched and what brother
[1:44:22] Jesus told
[1:44:23] me is that this man was a clean
[1:44:26] man he wanted to clean the
[1:44:31] government
[1:44:33] but but the one who was president at
[1:44:36] that
[1:44:37] time went against this
[1:44:40] man and they achieved to kill
[1:44:46] him and the name of this man that
[1:44:49] died Dono is Luis
[1:44:53] Donaldo
[1:44:57] colosio and what what surprised
[1:45:00] me when we got to the
[1:45:03] mum that he was it was a form of a
[1:45:08] pyramid we entered and we
[1:45:11] saw they had his his famous sayings that
[1:45:14] he
[1:45:15] said and even brother Jesus told
[1:45:19] me and some thought that he was
[1:45:23] Christian and because the way he spoke
[1:45:25] when he gave his
[1:45:27] speeches very similar to
[1:45:30] Daniel when we enter and we
[1:45:34] see there's there was a sayings there
[1:45:36] and there's coats there on the
[1:45:40] wall and brother Jus takes me there to
[1:45:42] the beneath what's under
[1:45:45] there there's more things about
[1:45:48] him and I enter to the bottom side
[1:45:52] and I'm looking at the
[1:45:54] wall and there's a there's a a picture
[1:45:56] that I
[1:45:58] see in that picture there's three
[1:46:02] menio in the middle is Luis Donaldo
[1:46:06] colossio and on the other
[1:46:09] side on both
[1:46:12] sides these were the these men lived
[1:46:15] during the time of Brother
[1:46:17] brandham John F Kennedy the first one
[1:46:19] was John F Kennedy
[1:46:22] a Catholic President and then the other
[1:46:24] side Martin Luther King Jr was Martha
[1:46:27] Luther King
[1:46:30] Jr two
[1:46:32] men that they
[1:46:35] say that they went against them to kill
[1:46:40] them and we're speaking about this topic
[1:46:42] of Russia
[1:46:44] communist
[1:46:46] Catholicism
[1:46:48] Babylon and then the Christian side
[1:46:51] died John F Kennedy and John F
[1:46:54] Kennedy he was a Catholic
[1:46:58] President he was elected as a president
[1:47:00] here in the United
[1:47:02] States and during that time when he was
[1:47:05] elected his opponent Richard Richard
[1:47:08] Nixon I believe it was Richard Nixon
[1:47:10] Richard Nixon and Richard Nixon brother
[1:47:13] Bram
[1:47:15] says he said there was fraud committed
[1:47:18] in the
[1:47:18] voting for The
[1:47:21] President Martin Luther King Jr now
[1:47:24] Martin Luther King
[1:47:28] Jr and he was defending the civil
[1:47:32] rights of the African-American
[1:47:36] people brother Ram says this and this
[1:47:39] impacted me a
[1:47:40] lot what he
[1:47:43] did that he was guiding his people to a
[1:47:47] killing and he
[1:47:49] says what he
[1:47:51] did was inspired by
[1:47:57] communist and that impacted me a
[1:48:01] lot I would say why would brother Bram
[1:48:03] say
[1:48:04] this now I believe brother
[1:48:08] brand but I couldn't understand how he
[1:48:10] was inspired by
[1:48:16] Communists when somebody is under a
[1:48:19] communist government
[1:48:21] system or a
[1:48:25] dictatorship one of the things that it
[1:48:27] produces re it's
[1:48:30] revolutions Civil Wars
[1:48:37] rebellion in that time the
[1:48:41] African-Americans arising against the
[1:48:43] government and against the
[1:48:49] polies that's why he said he was
[1:48:51] inspired by
[1:48:53] Communists but history repeats
[1:48:56] itself what happened during a time of
[1:48:58] brother brandham it happens
[1:49:02] again Biden a couple years ago when Joe
[1:49:05] Biden a Catholic President was elected
[1:49:10] Donal and his opponent Donald
[1:49:13] Trump he says fraud was uh being caused
[1:49:16] in the
[1:49:19] voting
[1:49:21] but in that time there was another
[1:49:22] movement for the African-Americans black
[1:49:24] lives matter which is black lives
[1:49:30] matter now we all know
[1:49:36] this now we see it when a a police a
[1:49:38] white man
[1:49:43] policeman when he shoots at a young boy
[1:49:46] that's
[1:49:48] African-American the whole country
[1:49:52] explodes where that Spirit comes from
[1:49:54] from back
[1:49:56] then Spirits don't
[1:49:58] die and history repeats
[1:50:04] itself so what happened in the
[1:50:07] past it happens again
[1:50:10] today it's it's not nothing new there's
[1:50:13] new names but same Spirits
[1:50:19] amen
[1:50:21] to what happened with
[1:50:22] Daniel it happened with
[1:50:26] Jesus men of the
[1:50:30] government abusing their government
[1:50:33] power to kill a just
[1:50:37] man in this case a Christian
[1:50:41] man so then Daniel was cast to the Lions
[1:50:46] then his only
[1:50:48] hope was God yes
[1:50:52] amen if the this the Communist system
[1:50:55] fails
[1:50:55] you and if this government fails
[1:50:58] you if this religion fails you your only
[1:51:02] hope is
[1:51:04] [Music]
[1:51:07] Christ Christ
[1:51:09] comes he will come in
[1:51:12] Armageddon to bring forth a
[1:51:14] rebellion against Babylon Med
[1:51:18] Persians
[1:51:20] and none of us shall die in that
[1:51:24] battle there's no way that you can kill
[1:51:26] an eternal
[1:51:27] body the Vengeance of his
[1:51:30] Temple and in the
[1:51:34] Millennium he will establish his own
[1:51:38] kingdom there will be Pagan Nations
[1:51:40] there there in the
[1:51:42] Millennium brother BR says it and the
[1:51:45] Bible also says
[1:51:47] it and the
[1:51:48] devil
[1:51:51] can do nothing in that
[1:51:54] Millennium the Bible said he will be
[1:51:56] tied down for thousands of years the
[1:51:58] only
[1:52:01] one can bring a successful
[1:52:04] Kingdom to Pagan Nations is
[1:52:09] Christ
[1:52:14] amen now Daniel being cast to The Lions
[1:52:17] Den it's a type
[1:52:20] of the
[1:52:21] death
[1:52:23] burial and
[1:52:25] resurrection of the Lord Jesus
[1:52:30] Christ because Christ when he
[1:52:34] died he was cast into a
[1:52:37] tomb and he was there in the Lion's
[1:52:40] Den he went to
[1:52:43] hell and he got his
[1:52:46] Vengeance with the
[1:52:48] Devil
[1:52:51] remember the devil went to the side of
[1:52:52] the
[1:52:53] north he preached to the
[1:52:55] Stars to the Seed of
[1:52:58] Abraham and some of those angels went
[1:53:01] with
[1:53:02] him now Christ goes to
[1:53:06] hell he preaches to the souls in
[1:53:10] prison and he takes the Saints of the
[1:53:13] Old
[1:53:13] Testament that were they found in
[1:53:17] Paradise there were two lions
[1:53:19] confronting them
[1:53:21] because the Bible
[1:53:23] says that Bible says the devil is like a
[1:53:26] roaring
[1:53:27] lion sinking who he may
[1:53:30] devour but the Bible also
[1:53:34] says that Christ is the lion of the
[1:53:36] tribe of
[1:53:38] Judah there were two lions they were
[1:53:43] fighting one will conquer the
[1:53:45] other and take the the other's
[1:53:48] Mana The Pride that the
[1:53:55] pride so what happened with
[1:53:57] Daniel it was a communist
[1:54:01] spirit that was used to kill
[1:54:04] him and the same happen with
[1:54:07] Jesus and the same is happening
[1:54:13] today let's go to
[1:54:17] Daniel let's see what side this king is
[1:54:19] on
[1:54:23] uh Daniel
[1:54:35] 6:17 and the stone was brought and laid
[1:54:37] upon the mouth of the den and the King
[1:54:38] sealed it with his own signate and with
[1:54:40] the signate of his Lord that the purpose
[1:54:42] might not be changed concerning
[1:54:48] Daniel now on the next day that followed
[1:54:51] the day of preparation the chief priests
[1:54:52] and Pharisees came together I'm
[1:54:56] sorry he said he laid down and he
[1:55:01] fasted What Spirit does the King show
[1:55:04] here the
[1:55:06] bear the
[1:55:09] atheist or the
[1:55:11] ram the
[1:55:18] Christian instruments of Music brought
[1:55:20] before him and his sleep went from
[1:55:23] him you can see how worried this king is
[1:55:27] for
[1:55:32] Daniel then the king arose very early in
[1:55:35] the morning and went into haste onto the
[1:55:36] den of the
[1:55:48] Lions and when he came to the den he
[1:55:50] cried with a lamentable voice unto
[1:55:52] Daniel and the King spake and said unto
[1:55:54] Daniel oh Daniel servant of the Living
[1:55:56] God is thy God whom thou servest
[1:55:58] continually able to deliver thee from
[1:56:00] the
[1:56:03] Lions then said Daniel unto the king oh
[1:56:06] King live
[1:56:18] forever
[1:56:21] my God has sent his Angel and has shut
[1:56:22] the lion's mouth that they have not hurt
[1:56:25] me for as much as before him innocent
[1:56:27] instancy was found in me and also before
[1:56:29] the king oh King have I done no
[1:56:42] hurt then was the king exceedingly glad
[1:56:45] for him and commanded that they should
[1:56:47] take take Daniel up out of the den So
[1:56:49] Daniel was taken up of a den and no man
[1:56:51] of hurt was found upon him because he
[1:56:53] believed in his
[1:57:09] God and the King commanded and they
[1:57:11] brought those men which accused Daniel
[1:57:14] and they cast him into the dens of lions
[1:57:16] them their children their wives and the
[1:57:18] Lions had their master of them and they
[1:57:20] break all their bones in pieces orever
[1:57:23] they came at the bottom of the
[1:57:32] den then then King darus wrote on to all
[1:57:35] the people and Nations and languages
[1:57:36] that dwell on all the Earth peace be
[1:57:38] multiplied onto
[1:57:41] you so we're going to show what kind of
[1:57:43] spirit this King
[1:57:46] has verse
[1:57:48] 26
[1:57:51] I make a
[1:57:57] decree that every Dominion of my kingdom
[1:58:00] men Trouble In Fear before the god of
[1:58:05] Daniel for he is a living God and
[1:58:08] steadfast
[1:58:09] [Music]
[1:58:11] forever and his kingdom sh that which
[1:58:13] shall not be
[1:58:16] destroyed and his Dominion shall be even
[1:58:18] unto the end
[1:58:21] he deliver and
[1:58:25] rescue and he worketh signs and wonders
[1:58:27] in heaven and the
[1:58:29] Earth who has delivered Daniel from the
[1:58:32] power of the
[1:58:36] Lions now showing the power of the
[1:58:40] Resurrection Daniel being tip being
[1:58:43] killed buried
[1:58:47] resurrected it caused that this
[1:58:50] King to that pertains to this Pagan
[1:58:54] Kingdom to become a
[1:58:58] Christian to show that resurrection
[1:59:01] power to one who is
[1:59:06] Pagan will cause that person that wants
[1:59:08] to be
[1:59:09] Christian you don't want to be a
[1:59:13] sinner but there's a percentage in you
[1:59:17] that's atheist that's unbelief
[1:59:21] that wants to rebel against Christ wants
[1:59:23] to go to the
[1:59:27] world but you inside of you there's a
[1:59:30] desire to be a
[1:59:32] Christian if God God if God to
[1:59:36] you shows you that resurrection power
[1:59:39] you accept that
[1:59:43] God so it's not just for the government
[1:59:46] but it's for the
[1:59:48] individual that wants to be atheist
[1:59:51] wants to be
[1:59:54] communist wants to rebel against their
[1:59:57] leader against
[1:59:59] God but there's another portion of
[2:00:03] you if you see that resurrection power
[2:00:07] in your life you accept that
[2:00:12] God Paul says in Philippians
[2:00:18] 3:10
[2:00:25] that I may know him and the power of
[2:00:27] resur Resurrection The Fellowship of his
[2:00:28] sufferings being made comfortable onto
[2:00:30] his
[2:00:32] death so the the the key of this Kingdom
[2:00:36] which is
[2:00:37] Pagan which is atheist and
[2:00:39] Christian and if you give it the
[2:00:44] opportunity to be a
[2:00:47] Christian to show that Resurrection
[2:00:49] power they will accept
[2:00:51] it what happened with
[2:00:54] Daniel in the Kingdom of of the reign of
[2:00:57] the medal
[2:00:58] Persians it's not just a
[2:01:01] story or history history repeats
[2:01:05] itself with the medal Persians of
[2:01:07] today
[2:01:09] Russia what happened with Daniel it
[2:01:12] happened
[2:01:15] again how many you remember when brother
[2:01:16] Ram had a
[2:01:18] vision
[2:01:20] when there was a little boy that was
[2:01:21] killed in the
[2:01:23] street he was ran over by a
[2:01:26] Russian it was obviously an
[2:01:29] accident but someone in the
[2:01:32] government killed
[2:01:35] someone so
[2:01:39] then so if you show that resurrection
[2:01:43] power to that
[2:01:45] Nation what will be their
[2:01:48] reaction
[2:01:50] brother message the voice of God in the
[2:01:52] last
[2:01:55] days and in Russia the birthplace of
[2:02:00] Communism which many years
[2:02:04] ago when I was just a boy
[2:02:11] preacher I say 33 years ago when na
[2:02:14] Nazism fascism and communism was
[2:02:17] Rising
[2:02:22] I said I speak in the name of the Lord
[2:02:23] they all wind up in
[2:02:27] communism but did you ever
[2:02:32] think God has left God has left us an
[2:02:35] Avenue
[2:02:37] out if we just take
[2:02:40] it there's only 1% of Russia that's
[2:02:44] communism
[2:02:47] 1% but but they're the the the percent
[2:02:50] that's
[2:02:52] controlling 1% of
[2:02:55] Communism 1% of Russia is
[2:02:58] communism rather but they
[2:03:01] control hwood but the same thing with
[2:03:05] Hollywood Holly ones one place but
[2:03:07] they're in
[2:03:13] control about onethird or two-thirds of
[2:03:16] the population of the United States goes
[2:03:17] to church
[2:03:19] and his church
[2:03:22] members but they control in those
[2:03:29] denominations what what communism needs
[2:03:31] over there is a voice of God rise up
[2:03:33] amongst
[2:03:34] them and it will put him to
[2:03:37] shame in
[2:03:41] Finland when the little boy was raised
[2:03:43] from the dead that
[2:03:47] day
[2:03:50] and they was bringing me three squares
[2:03:53] away communist
[2:03:55] soldiers
[2:03:58] Russians were standing there with a
[2:04:00] Russian
[2:04:03] salute and tears running down their
[2:04:06] cheeks and they
[2:04:10] said they said we will receive a God
[2:04:13] that can raise the
[2:04:16] dead it is the negligence of the
[2:04:18] Catholic church and the Lutheran
[2:04:23] Church and all those
[2:04:26] denominations and they're taking all of
[2:04:28] the
[2:04:29] money and building
[2:04:32] organizations and giving the people
[2:04:35] nothing they live like the rest of the
[2:04:39] people notice it was
[2:04:42] God that shut the lion's mouth there
[2:04:45] with
[2:04:46] Daniel what Russia needs
[2:04:49] is a
[2:04:52] prophet to rise on the scene with the
[2:04:54] word of the
[2:04:56] Lord that can shut their
[2:05:00] mouths then that 90% will take
[2:05:04] over the sto history begins to repeat
[2:05:07] itself what happened then what happened
[2:05:12] today it's not just for Russia but it's
[2:05:15] also for
[2:05:16] you God has resurrected us
[2:05:20] that we're
[2:05:21] dead and in our sins and
[2:05:24] trespasses we're no longer pagans we're
[2:05:28] no longer atheists we're no longer
[2:05:33] Communists if we don't like what Christ
[2:05:35] has for
[2:05:36] us then we rebel against
[2:05:39] him we're no longer that
[2:05:43] part we're part of that
[2:05:45] Ram that has seven horns
[2:05:49] that represents seven Church
[2:05:51] ages and we're part of those
[2:05:54] horns what side do you want to be on uh
[2:05:58] the the Beast the side of the Beast the
[2:06:01] atheist or the ram the
[2:06:05] Christian Christ has already showed
[2:06:08] you with that little boy that was raised
[2:06:11] up but mainly in your
[2:06:14] heart and you saw a lot many
[2:06:17] testimonies how people will live in
[2:06:20] sin and God would take them out of that
[2:06:24] condition God would take them out of the
[2:06:25] lion Den
[2:06:28] amen God can do the same thing to
[2:06:31] you he can take out your sinful
[2:06:34] life it can take you out of the Lion's
[2:06:38] Den be part of that
[2:06:40] Ram let us
[2:06:47] stand let us
[2:06:50] pray Heavenly
[2:06:53] Father we give you thanks for your word
[2:06:57] Lord we can see that there's
[2:07:01] spirits that govern this
[2:07:04] world but there's only one
[2:07:09] spirit that can successfully govern all
[2:07:12] these
[2:07:13] nations and that is the holy
[2:07:16] spirit but Lord begin etern
[2:07:21] allow us not to be like that
[2:07:25] bear that rebel against Christ when we
[2:07:28] hear something we don't
[2:07:31] like when we want to be
[2:07:34] atheist help us to be like the
[2:07:37] ram which is a domestic
[2:07:41] animal a household L
[2:07:45] animal and we are from the house of God
[2:07:49] help everyone
[2:07:50] Lord to make their
[2:07:52] decision they want to be atheists or
[2:07:55] they want to be
[2:07:57] Christians they already know what's the
[2:07:59] end of The
[2:08:02] Atheist and we already know the end of
[2:08:04] those who are
[2:08:06] rams we give you thanks for Thy word
