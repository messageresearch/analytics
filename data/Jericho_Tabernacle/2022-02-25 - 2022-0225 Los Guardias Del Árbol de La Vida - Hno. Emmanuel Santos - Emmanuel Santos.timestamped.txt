[28:18] we ask all these things in the name of
[28:19] jesus christ amen amen
[28:26] you can open up your scriptures in
[28:28] genesis the third chapter
[28:32] verse 21.
[28:40] when you have it
[28:50] and to his wife that the lord make coats
[28:52] of skins and clothe them
[28:56] is
[29:05] the lord god said behold the man has
[29:07] become one of us to know good and evil
[29:09] and now let us put forth his hand and
[29:12] take also the tree of life and eat and
[29:14] to live forever
[29:20] therefore the lord god sent him forth
[29:22] from the garden of eden to till the
[29:23] ground from whence he was
[29:36] so he drove out the man and he placed at
[29:39] the east of the garden of eden cherubins
[29:41] and at the flaming sword which turned
[29:42] every way to keep away the tree of life
[29:50] let's go to hebrews the 10th chapter the
[29:52] first
[30:12] the law having a shadow of good things
[30:14] to come and not to every image of things
[30:16] can every with those with those
[30:18] sacrifices which they offer year by year
[30:20] continually making those comers they're
[30:22] on to perfect
[30:26] may the lord bless you his word you may
[30:27] take your seats
[30:33] before beginning i would like to say
[30:36] estas
[30:39] san luis let's say that this past
[30:41] weekend we went to san luis obispo
[30:44] [Music]
[30:46] i believe it was a really good trip
[30:51] the lord helped us to get there and to
[30:53] come back with everything fine
[30:57] also received greetings from the
[30:58] brothers over there
[31:01] and from brother leyva
[31:02] into
[31:11] to speak the same topic that i spoke
[31:14] over there and speak it here
[31:58] let's go to isaiah the 6th chapter
[32:02] 1.
[32:12] is
[32:14] in the year the king of zion died i saw
[32:17] also the lord sitting upon a throne high
[32:19] and lifted up and his train filled the
[32:22] temple
[32:32] above it stood the surface each one had
[32:34] six wings with twain he covered his face
[32:37] and with twain he covered his feet and
[32:39] with twain he did fly
[32:54] they have six
[33:09] unto the other and said holy holy holy
[33:12] is the lord of hosts the whole earth is
[33:14] full of his glory lost
[33:22] in the post of the door moved at the
[33:23] voice of him that cried and the house
[33:25] was filled with the smoke
[33:26] entrance
[33:38] then said i woe is me for i am undone
[33:41] because i am a man of unclean lips and i
[33:43] dwell in the midst of people of unclean
[33:45] lips for my eyes i've seen the king the
[33:47] lord of hosts
[34:00] being that the bible is a prophetic book
[34:04] it requires
[34:18] when the law was changed onto grace
[34:21] in the law
[34:22] los diese la villain genesis the bible
[34:25] says in genesis
[34:28] that says they guarded the way
[34:31] or they kept away from the tree of life
[34:36] says the tree of life is jesus christ
[34:40] but when jesus christ came el dijo yo
[34:42] soy el camino he said i am the way
[34:44] el mismo second
[34:47] he himself converted himself onto the
[34:49] way okay
[34:52] but those same guards were protecting
[34:55] el camino now before they protected the
[34:57] way
[34:59] so no one can come close
[35:04] if someone was to come close to the
[35:05] presence of god a la presence literally
[35:07] to the literal presence
[35:10] one can fall dead
[35:15] you can go with the book of revelations
[35:16] the first chapter hablando cerca de juan
[35:19] speaking of john di cuando el bio jesus
[35:22] you say when he saw jesus
[35:25] he said he felt as dead
[35:41] when you want the love of god to descend
[35:43] unto you
[35:46] it's a shadow of a shadow of a shadow
[35:49] literally it's not something literal
[36:40] of what john did
[36:42] we were going to fall as dead
[36:45] because this body is hybrid
[36:49] was not made to be in the prince of god
[38:04] they're there
[38:07] to have their face covered
[38:10] we will go on to his presence
[38:15] at the capacity
[38:31] you're going to see them over there
[38:35] revealed physically unto you
[38:44] guardians now those were the guards are
[38:46] at il
[38:49] now the job of those guards
[38:53] it was changed
[38:55] when it was law
[38:57] montenegro
[39:32] let us therefore come boldly onto the
[39:34] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[39:37] and find grace to help in the time of
[39:39] need
[39:59] in the old testament we have laws and
[40:00] by-laws and things that people had to do
[40:02] by the works of the law to be saved
[40:11] but god wound everything in the old
[40:13] testament right up and put it in calvary
[40:19] that the believer now only has one thing
[40:21] to do esmerarel
[40:38] and everything passed away with the
[40:39] shedding of the blood
[40:41] pressure
[40:42] now notice what it says here
[40:46] when my shadow was coming to me
[40:50] when my
[40:53] [Music]
[41:50] more that the image and the shadow
[41:52] mean
[41:53] the more they get closer
[41:56] and if you notice
[41:57] oscura
[41:58] the more darker
[42:00] sombra the
[42:03] and more clear or visible does the
[42:05] shadow look see
[42:07] it looks more darker
[42:11] until finally the the shadow disappears
[42:13] sila layla sombra
[42:26] there was an eclipse
[42:45] that's why there was an eclipse at
[42:47] calvary
[42:49] that's what the bible says in matthew
[42:51] 27.
[42:52] verse 40.
[43:03] that destroys the temple and build this
[43:05] in three days save thyself and that be
[43:08] the son of god come down from the cross
[43:18] likewise also the chief priests mocking
[43:20] him and the scribes and the elders said
[43:22] autro salvo has
[43:30] he saved others himself he cannot save
[43:32] if he if he be the king of israel let
[43:34] him now come down from the cross and we
[43:36] will and we will believe him confined
[43:47] he trusted in god let him deliver him
[43:49] now if he will have if he will have him
[43:51] for he said i am the son of god
[43:54] the thieves also which were crucified
[43:56] with with him cast them in the same as
[43:58] in his teeth
[44:05] now from the sixth hour there was
[44:06] darkness all over the land onto the
[44:08] ninth hour
[44:11] la gracia as more grace gets closer
[44:16] more darker does the shadow get dela
[44:19] which is the law foreign
[44:39] [Applause]
[44:48] natural sun rose
[44:52] also the son of god
[44:56] because darkness went away
[45:00] and the light of the gospel came in
[45:16] scripture
[45:31] of death i will fear no evil for thou
[45:33] art with me thy rod and thy staff they
[45:35] comfort me
[45:39] now remember the bible is not a book of
[45:42] uh poetry poetry it's a liberal
[46:12] behind every word
[46:16] that god inspires every man with that he
[46:18] wrote the bible
[46:21] that brother says in the message
[46:24] the law having a shadow
[46:56] it's the valley of shadows not the dark
[46:58] shadows
[47:00] or the dark valley
[47:04] it's the valley of the shadow of death
[47:36] trying to scare him when there's enough
[47:38] life mixed up in it
[47:42] to show that there's light somewhere
[47:48] that's why the christian is not scared
[47:49] of death
[48:19] sombra which is a shadow
[48:21] la luz that takes you all to the light
[48:23] anos
[48:24] to our future home
[48:28] element
[48:31] says the message the angel of the lord
[48:36] all right come ahead lady aqui el esta
[48:39] di cernino
[48:40] here he's discerning a lady
[48:44] all right everybody rev red creos
[48:48] you believe sister i want you to look
[48:50] this way now
[48:52] have faith
[48:55] believe in god with all your heart
[48:58] what do you think about all this
[49:28] why is the prophet seeing it this way
[49:32] because that's how it's written in the
[49:33] bible
[49:36] the valley of the shadows of death
[49:40] god doesn't do anything outside his
[49:42] bible
[49:44] i hear with this prophet
[49:47] he's revealing him a vision
[49:51] that is perfectly aligned with the bible
[49:55] a woman in the past
[50:16] you're truly made up your mind that this
[50:18] is truly god's way of healing you is
[50:22] that right
[50:24] you believe that with
[50:52] is
[50:54] [Applause]
[51:20] of life have mercy upon this woman
[51:27] before she kissed his uremic poison and
[51:29] killed her senor satanas
[51:32] lord satan is determined but amanda
[52:18] closer was that shadow was going to
[52:20] disappear
[52:22] at the grace of the lord
[52:24] with this healing power
[52:27] comes close to you
[52:43] just because you have a sickness no
[52:45] significa
[52:46] doesn't mean you're going to die
[52:48] the devil wants to do that
[52:53] to send you to a premature grave
[52:56] but you have a light where you can run
[52:58] to puerto
[53:12] now remember
[53:27] before they were maintaining the people
[53:28] away alright
[53:31] now that the wave was provided
[53:37] those guards direct the people to the
[53:39] tree vamos apocalypse
[53:54] the book is a prophetic book
[53:57] the bible is a prophetic book
[54:01] then it requires a prophet
[54:04] to reveal the symbols
[54:21] and after this i looked and behold a
[54:23] door was open in heaven and the first
[54:25] voice which i heard was as they were of
[54:27] a trumpet talking to me which said come
[54:29] up hither and i will show the things
[54:31] which must be hereafter
[54:35] now the portion where i want you to
[54:36] notice
[54:50] that they put those guards al este
[54:52] of the east
[54:55] of the of the garden
[54:59] but the ram says
[55:03] says that there was a door
[55:15] came to offer their sacrifice
[55:32] so
[55:46] jerusalem
[56:15] blood of jesus christ
[56:17] necessaries all those necessary things
[56:21] to get to god's throne
[56:23] and not to die
[56:25] jesus were provided by jesus christ
[56:56] i was in the spirit and behold a throne
[56:58] was set in heaven and once sat on the
[57:00] throne
[57:10] detras and before the throne there was a
[57:12] sea of glass like onto crystal and the
[57:15] midst of the throne and around about the
[57:17] throne were four beasts full of eyes
[57:20] before and behind
