[27:12] um so good to be here to uh dedicate
[27:15] this service to the youth Amen to the
[27:18] young people to the children
[27:21] um so we're gonna give God first the
[27:24] honor and the Glory by uh reading a
[27:26] scripture
[27:27] and then we're going to be praying
[27:30] Let's uh go straight to
[27:33] Hebrews 11 7.
[27:37] how's everybody doing this evening
[27:40] amen
[27:42] we're gonna we're gonna have a good time
[27:43] amen just worshiping in the Lord and
[27:46] giving him the glory
[27:49] who can guess what uh what story we're
[27:51] going to be talking about today
[27:54] I can't hear anybody
[27:56] what story are you going to be talking
[27:58] about
[27:59] no uh yes
[28:02] if you didn't already know it kind of
[28:05] looks like it already but okay Hebrews
[28:08] I'm gonna be saying it a little bit
[28:09] different
[28:10] um in the King James version it says a
[28:12] certain way but I'm going to say it uh
[28:14] more simpler so that children can
[28:16] understand it
[28:17] Hebrews 11 7 it says it was by faith
[28:21] that Noah built a large boat to save his
[28:25] family from the flood
[28:28] he obeyed God who warned him about
[28:31] things that had never happened before
[28:34] by his faith Noah condemned the rest of
[28:37] the world and he received the
[28:39] righteousness that comes by faith Amen
[28:42] Let Us bow our heads
[28:45] Heavenly Father Lord we just want to
[28:47] give you the honor and the glory Lord we
[28:49] dedicate this service to you
[28:52] father we come here with our sincere
[28:54] Hearts father we just want each and
[28:57] every person to receive something from
[28:59] it father from the youngest to the
[29:01] oldest we thank you Lord we ask that you
[29:05] help each and every person here we thank
[29:07] you we ask that you touch each and every
[29:10] person that's going to be in the play
[29:11] each and every person playing all the
[29:14] young people participating and all the
[29:16] audience father we give you the glory in
[29:19] the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
[29:22] and amen amen you may be seated
[29:26] so we all know the story of Noah right
[29:29] he was a man that got swallowed by a big
[29:32] whale right
[29:34] no
[29:36] or maybe he was uh the one that uh took
[29:40] all the children of Israel through dry
[29:42] land between the Red Sea was that Noah
[29:46] who is Noah
[29:49] he was the one that built an ark right
[29:53] so our theme for this Children's Service
[29:56] is obeying God the obedience
[30:01] so who who knows about obedience I want
[30:04] to see your hands raised
[30:07] we all know about obeying our parents
[30:10] obeying the Lord right
[30:13] the Bible says that he obeyed God that's
[30:17] what the Bible says obey means to follow
[30:20] commands or guidance of somebody or to
[30:24] listen and to do it
[30:26] when Mom says to do something what do we
[30:29] have to do we have to obey right
[30:31] but Noah he didn't just obey because
[30:34] obeying is pretty easy
[30:36] right for us good kids obeying is really
[30:40] easy go take out the trash Oh that's
[30:43] easy I'll go do that go wash the dishes
[30:45] okay that's easy but Noah he obeyed God
[30:50] and the Bible says that he obeyed God on
[30:53] something that never happened before
[30:57] so what didn't happen what what didn't
[31:00] happen before no it's Noah's time
[31:04] it never rained
[31:06] so it never rained before Noah's time
[31:09] and so God told him
[31:13] he said Noah
[31:14] there's been a lot of sin in this world
[31:17] a lot of disobedient people people don't
[31:20] want to listen to my words anymore
[31:22] people don't want to follow my
[31:25] Commandments anymore but you're the only
[31:27] one that obeys me
[31:29] so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
[31:32] flood the whole earth with water
[31:35] now that's pretty normal maybe not in
[31:38] Phoenix but it's normal other places
[31:40] where there's a lot of rain it's like oh
[31:43] rain okay yeah let it rain but back then
[31:46] there was no rain
[31:49] there was and that was a hard thing to
[31:51] to think about that was a hard thing to
[31:54] believe because there had never been any
[31:57] rain and now there's God saying there's
[31:59] going to be water coming down from the
[32:02] sky
[32:03] it never rained before so why do you
[32:06] think Noah obeyed God
[32:09] what's what's a reason why God Noah
[32:12] obeyed God
[32:13] because there's no reason to obey
[32:16] somebody that says something that it has
[32:19] never happened before it's going to rain
[32:21] well it never happened before why should
[32:24] I believe him
[32:25] well the reason why Noah obeyed God was
[32:28] because he trusted in the Lord
[32:32] that's how we can obey God that's where
[32:35] obedience comes because the Bible says
[32:38] in Hebrews 11 it says it was by faith
[32:42] that Noah built a large boat to save his
[32:46] family from the flood so it was by
[32:49] trusting the Lord
[32:51] he trusted him with his whole heart with
[32:54] everything he had and because of that
[32:55] even no matter how outrageous the word
[33:00] was no matter what how crazy it sounded
[33:03] he trusted the Lord and he says you know
[33:06] what I don't care if I don't understand
[33:08] but I Trust You Lord and because he
[33:11] trusted him and because he have faith in
[33:13] him he obeyed him
[33:16] amen can everybody say Amen
[33:19] amen so he obeyed him so why do we obey
[33:22] our parents then
[33:24] because we trust them
[33:27] because
[33:28] they they take care of us
[33:31] they're the ones that have taken care of
[33:32] us our whole
[33:34] seven years our whole 11 years our whole
[33:38] life
[33:40] God has been taking or our parents have
[33:42] been taking care of us and we trust them
[33:45] we know that they'll never lead us
[33:48] astray that that they have our best
[33:51] interest
[33:52] that they want the best for us
[33:54] so then we could obey them
[33:57] because we trust them
[34:00] amen
[34:02] we obey our parents because we trust
[34:04] them even if some things we don't
[34:07] understand
[34:08] why do I have to clean my room
[34:10] it's perfect it's a perfect mess I like
[34:13] it where I like all my stuffed animals
[34:16] right here I like all my stuff right
[34:18] here it's perfect the way it is I love
[34:20] having my room as a kitchen
[34:23] I love having it as outside too
[34:26] I love doing all my things that I want
[34:28] to do my Explorations and my adventures
[34:30] in my room just leave it the way it is
[34:33] but here comes mom here comes dad you
[34:35] got to clean your room
[34:37] but they know best there's a reason why
[34:40] and we don't say well why and we stomp
[34:42] our feet but we know that for some
[34:45] reason I don't know why but Mom and Dad
[34:47] know best
[34:49] so what do we do we follow the
[34:52] Commandments of our parents and we say
[34:54] okay I'll clean because they know best
[34:58] who likes to uh play ball in the middle
[35:00] of the street
[35:03] when I was a kid I used to I loved it
[35:05] that's the best
[35:07] best place to kick the ball that's the
[35:09] best place to dribble because you know
[35:12] when when where I lived my yard was just
[35:14] full of dirt so I needed the street to
[35:17] play in
[35:18] but when it was time for my parents to
[35:20] say get out of the street Eli I didn't
[35:23] say well why
[35:26] I knew they knew best
[35:28] there was a reason they had my best
[35:31] interest they knew what I needed and
[35:34] they knew oh you know what cars are
[35:36] going to start driving by here
[35:39] they knew danger is ahead so it's like
[35:42] okay Mom I'm gonna well not a lot of
[35:44] time a lot of times I didn't listen
[35:46] and that's another topic of disobedience
[35:50] because what obedience does
[35:53] when you obey you know what it does
[35:56] what did it do for Adam or what did it
[35:59] do for uh Noah
[36:01] what did obedience do for Noah
[36:06] yeah all the way in the back the shark
[36:08] there
[36:10] it saved his life somebody else said it
[36:13] here it saved his life
[36:15] it saved his life yes brother
[36:18] it saved his family also
[36:22] obedience saves your life
[36:26] because God has the best interest in
[36:29] your life
[36:30] he knows what's best so when you obey
[36:33] the word whether it's your parents or
[36:36] it's your teachers
[36:38] or maybe it's a deacon
[36:41] maybe it's the pastor
[36:44] maybe it's
[36:46] your auntie or your uncle
[36:49] they know the best for you
[36:52] so we say okay I'll do this because
[36:55] maybe there's some Danger
[36:57] but what does Disobedience do
[37:00] well we see that in the story of Adam
[37:02] and Eve right
[37:04] the Disobedience came
[37:07] when Adam and Eve disobeyed God
[37:10] and what happened it messed up
[37:13] everything for us
[37:15] now we get tired now we have to go to
[37:18] sleep at night now we get sick and we
[37:21] get flus
[37:23] now we cry sometimes
[37:25] now we have to go through certain things
[37:27] now we have to go to school because we
[37:29] have to learn
[37:30] before then we didn't have to learn we
[37:32] knew everything
[37:34] but Disobedience it through everything
[37:38] sin covered the whole entire world when
[37:42] Disobedience happened
[37:43] and when we disobey our parents when we
[37:46] disobey what happens
[37:48] bad things happens there's consequences
[37:51] don't run the red light
[37:54] well there's a reason why we don't run
[37:56] the red light right
[37:57] maybe we can run it a few times because
[37:59] it's not going to hold us back it's just
[38:01] the light
[38:02] but you keep running it every once in a
[38:05] while there's going to be one time
[38:06] there's going to be a car coming the
[38:08] other way
[38:10] and hit the other car
[38:12] and that's the consequence of disobeying
[38:15] laws
[38:16] disobeying our parents disobeying the
[38:19] word of the Lord
[38:21] but Obedience of God what it does it
[38:25] gives you eternal life
[38:27] I could tell you this that it is the
[38:30] most important thing in a Christian's
[38:32] call
[38:34] is to obey God
[38:36] don't worry because a lot of times it's
[38:39] hard to obey God because we have this
[38:42] Fallen flesh but God gives us his Spirit
[38:45] to obey him
[38:46] he'll give us the the strength to obey
[38:50] him and that is the single most
[38:53] important thing to do is obey God and
[38:55] when you obey his word everything else
[38:58] will fall with it everything else will
[39:02] will come along everything else will
[39:04] fall into place
[39:06] when we obey his word but God gives us
[39:09] the help to do it
[39:11] he gives us his holy spirit
[39:14] so it might be hard to stop lying it
[39:17] might be hard to stop stealing but we
[39:20] once we receive the Holy Ghost it's
[39:22] going to be a joy to serve the Lord
[39:26] God says move over here we say yes Lord
[39:28] I'll move over here
[39:30] God says build an ark okay I don't
[39:33] understand but I'm going to start
[39:34] building an ark Lord
[39:36] God starts saying you know uh get away
[39:38] from the world it's doing this to you
[39:40] yes Lord I'll do it because I'm obeying
[39:43] the Lord knowing that wherever his words
[39:45] take me
[39:47] I'm going to the path of eternal life
[39:51] what a beautiful thing right
[39:53] his words is a lamp to my feet it's a
[39:57] way so every time we obey his word what
[40:00] are we doing we're following it as a
[40:02] path
[40:03] and what's that path going to take us to
[40:06] to eternal life amen
[40:08] and that's what Noah the story of Noah
[40:12] is is him obeying God throughout all of
[40:16] the Disobedience all the things that
[40:19] were going on
[40:20] Noah there was one man
[40:22] you can be that young lady today you can
[40:26] be that young man today

[40:54] amen it's going to be us

[43:51] the Earth was formless and empty dark
[43:55] Ness covered through Deep's Waters
[43:58] and the spirit of God began to hover
[44:01] over the surface of the waters and
[44:04] created many great things
[44:07] you create a beautiful place called
[44:09] Garden Eden
[44:11] it was full of different kinds of plants
[44:14] trees
[44:15] or all the animals lived in harmony
[44:21] then God created Adam
[44:28] and then he created Eve in his own image
[44:31] and placed them in the Garden of Eden
[44:34] he blessed them and said be fruitful and
[44:38] multiply fill the Earth and government
[44:42] Reign Over The Fish the sea birds in the
[44:46] air
[44:48] and the animals that run along the
[44:50] ground
[44:52] they loved God
[44:54] and made every word that he has spoke to
[44:56] them
[44:57] the animals even obeyed them
[44:59] and the Earth followed their commands
[45:04] every day Adam and Eve worship God and
[45:08] God took care of them fed them
[45:11] man had a perfect fellowship with God
[45:13] there was nothing wrong God came down in
[45:17] the evening talked to Adam and Eve
[45:19] what a beautiful picture nothing could
[45:22] harm them no sickness could ever come to
[45:25] them
[45:26] they didn't know what old age was they
[45:29] didn't know
[45:30] about hurt
[45:32] they were in the presence of God which
[45:34] helped them control and guided them by
[45:37] his spirit
[45:44] God commanded them not to eat of the
[45:46] tree of knowledge
[45:48] one day Adam and Eve disobeyed God
[45:57] and that's when sin struck the Earth
[45:58] like a black sheep fallen from the
[46:01] heavens
[46:02] that paralyzed the Earth
[46:04] and throwed everything every creature on
[46:07] the Earth all of God's creation into
[46:10] bondage
[46:11] man was under the barnage of death
[46:13] sickness trouble sorrows
[46:16] and they were set there in helplessness
[46:20] because every creature on Earth was
[46:23] subject to it and everyone born on Earth
[46:26] was subject to it
[46:29] as men
[46:30] [Music]
[46:31] began to live outside the presence of
[46:34] God
[46:35] because of Disobedience they began to
[46:38] seek knowledge creating an intellectual
[46:41] people
[46:42] they didn't sleep under the stars
[46:44] anymore as they once did
[46:47] the people didn't want the presence of
[46:49] God but sought after worldly
[46:52] understanding
[46:55] [Music]
[46:57] the people didn't want
[46:59] the presence of God
[47:02] they built homes and shelters
[47:04] out from the dangers of the weather
[47:08] they became experts in forging bronze
[47:12] and iron
[47:13] they created musical instruments
[47:16] and they played them
[47:18] sin continued
[47:22] the man began to cry out to the Lord
[47:27] but sin was too great because of the
[47:30] Disobedience and Rebellion
[47:33] the Lord observed at the extent of the
[47:35] human wickedness on the earth and saw
[47:38] that everything they thought or imagined
[47:40] was consistently and totally evil
[47:46] so the Lord said he was sorry he had
[47:49] ever made them and put them on the Earth
[47:52] it broke his heart
[47:55] and the Lord said I will wipe the human
[47:57] race I have created
[47:59] from the Earth
[48:01] yes and I will destroy every living
[48:04] thing all the people large animals and
[48:07] the small animals that were on along the
[48:08] ground and even the birds in the sky
[48:11] I'm sorry I ever made this
[48:14] but then there was one man that was
[48:17] righteous
[48:19] this was blameless person living on the
[48:21] earth at the time
[48:23] he loved to walk in the presence and
[48:26] fellowship with God
[48:27] and his name was Noah and he found favor
[48:30] with the Lord
[48:33] so God said to Noah
[48:35] I have decided to destroy the living
[48:39] things in this Earth for they have
[48:41] filled the Earth with violence look
[48:44] I am about to cover the Earth with a
[48:47] water a flood I will destroy everything
[48:51] and freeze but I will keep my promise to
[48:55] you
[48:56] rise up and build me an ark from go
[48:59] forward
[49:00] and waterproof the tar inside and out
[49:06] then construct decks
[49:09] and stalls
[49:12] throughout the inside
[49:15] make the ark 150 110 feet long 75 feet
[49:20] wide
[49:21] 45 feet high
[49:24] leave 18 inch opening below the roof and
[49:28] all around the boat
[49:30] put a door on the side and build three
[49:34] decks
[49:35] inside the boat lower middle and upper
[49:44] Noah obeyed every word that God had
[49:48] spoken to him
[50:04] so they labored for years
[50:06] building the ark
[50:10] and as the years
[50:13] began to roll by
[50:17] people became curious and what the
[50:20] commotion Noah and his family were
[50:22] making
[50:25] they began to ask him
[50:27] why are you building this Ark in the
[50:29] middle of the desert
[50:31] Noah told them because the disobedience
[50:37] and wickedness of the people
[50:41] God is going to descend water from the
[50:44] sky and flood the whole Earth
[50:46] those who chose to obey the Lord will
[50:49] find safety within the ark
[50:52] and know welcome them to come in
[50:55] [Applause]
[50:58] as he
[51:00] put up the ark laid the Timbers
[51:06] the board mix
[51:07] people laughed at him and made fun of
[51:10] him
[51:11] [Applause]
[51:16] now Noah finished the ark and stood at
[51:19] the door
[51:20] as he was sure that no one was going to
[51:23] believe him
[51:24] but for a hundred and twenty years he
[51:27] preached to the people and nobody obeyed
[51:32] then everything was ready the Lord said
[51:34] to Noah go into the boat with all your
[51:38] family for among all the people of the
[51:41] Earth
[51:41] I can see that you alone are righteous
[51:46] take a pair of every kind of animal male
[51:50] and female into the ark with you
[51:53] to keep them alive during the flood
[51:55] pairs every kind bird and every kind of
[51:59] animal and every kind of small animal
[52:01] that runs on the ground
[52:04] come
[52:06] to keep them alive seven days from now I
[52:09] will make the rains pour down on the
[52:12] earth and it will rain for 40 days and
[52:15] 40 nights until I have wiped the Earth
[52:18] of all living things I have created
[52:32] God's going with me
[52:37] he's right beside me
[52:40] I know how he loves me
[52:45] from my head to my toes
