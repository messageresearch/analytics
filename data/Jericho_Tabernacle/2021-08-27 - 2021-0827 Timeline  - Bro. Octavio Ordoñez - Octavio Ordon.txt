out amen so i got a i got something i'll call today with uh with all the respect to the lord blessed assurance policy i'd like to show you this blessed assurance policies remember this message is for the youth record we'll have a few things for the for the adults also [Music] then i'll read to you what brother braham says about this assurance policy i think everyone should have this policy with them every time you get a chance you should reach your policy there's a few rules when you get a life insurance policy existed there's different types of insurance policies uh different classes it was limited live policy existed you'll the one that will see the money is the one that stays behind in this case you'll get the the policy when you leave this world but in the meantime you have a lot of benefits you can use today does it make sense would you like to know what's inside the policy okay we'll go with future tense okay future tense what's in the policy for you we can go with the past podemos we'll look at different parts but in this case i really like and i'm really interested on the future i'm going to do a lot of reading there's a lot of information in here much information but we'll use three scriptures to base my thoughts we'll read on second peter pedro chapter three el capitan three 2 peter chapter 3. this second epistle of beloved i now write unto you in both which i stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance what scripture is that uh ii peter chapter three second peter the first verse peter chapter 3 first verse now it's the second verse that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandments of us the apostles of the lord and savior apostles knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue and they were from the beginning of the creation of for this they willingly are ignorant of what of that they by the word of god the heavens were of all and the earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the word that then was being overflown with waters perished but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept and stored reserved unto the fire against the day of judgment and perdition of of this one thing that one day is with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day ignorance is the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some man counts likeness but is long-suffering to us we're not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance perez but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat and the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up in seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy cumber conversations and godliness okay looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat esperandorandos in san diego nevertheless we according to the his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless is an account that the long-suffering of the lord is salvation even as our beloved brother paul also according to the wisdom given unto him as also in all his epistles speaking to them the things in which are some things hard to understand which they that are unlearned and unstable rest and they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction is ye therefore beloved sing ye know these things before beware lest ye also being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own steadfastness but in grow but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ to him be glory both now and forever amen gloria amen amen i have a another scripture for you uh chapter 21 of revelation remember this is your assurance policy record it's telling you what's going to happen in the future if you accept this policy and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more seed beyonce and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as an as a bride adorned and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god yohiyunnagram and god shall wipe away all their tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful established today and he said unto me it's it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end i will give unto him that is a thirst the fountain the waters of life freely el principe de la fuente del agua de la vida who shall receive this he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son [Music] that's pretty good to me [Music] isaiah 65 17. we'll read this last scripture and i'll explain to you a little bit of what all this means for behold i create a new heavens and a new earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come in mind but be glad and rejoice forever and that which i create for behold i create jerusalem and rejoicing and her people a joy and i will rejoice in jerusalem and joy in my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her nor the voice of crying allegra jerusalem there shall be no more than an infant of days nor an old man that hath not filled his days for the child shall die and hundred years old but the sinner being an 100 year 100 years old shall be a curse and they shall build houses and inherit them and they shall plant vineyards and eat of the fruit of them and they shall not built in another inhabit they shall not plant and another eat for as the days of a tree are the days of my people and my neglect shall long enjoy the work of their hands they shall not labor in vain nor bring forth for trouble for they are the seed of the blessed of the lord and their offspring with them and it shall come to pass that before they call i will answer and while they are yet speaking i will answer ya the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock and the dust shall be the serpent's meat they shall not hurt nor destroy and all my holy mountain saith the lord this is what's written on this blessed assurance is would you like for me to explain a little bit of the future this is according to my is so we all have a uh an idea this is not exactly uh you can't say thus says the lord [Music] okay okay uh well i have one more scripture for you uh would you put uh the slide up please transparency seven thousand years time is the timeline is a topic for today uh okay seven years is what god has worked with you can bring that to the garden of eden [Music] milanos from noah to jesus time were about another 2000 years now from jesus to us what year is it about 2 000 years so the arrow pointing up that's what if we have like we read people saying well we've heard that all our lives we still believe that that's what we're taught something else and uh brother branham uh explains it very well now the part i want to focus on it's from the rapture to the end of time that's pretty cool huh yeah and we we went over that i think it's pretty interesting but let's look at a couple things brother abraham says we would see jesus 1958. it says here and then the gentiles had two thousand years of training like the jews had two thousand years since the anti-deliverance destruction of those this happens in cycles of 2 000 years first 2 000 years this is the end of the gentiles another 2 000 years old now at the end of this age he's got to declare himself the same as he did then or he did wrong if he declared it the way and if he declared it that way and then let them get by just with their big fine churches and find scholars and everything if he didn't come back to the same jesus and do the same thing then he's not the same jesus is if he does he's the same jesus now is he or isn't he how many believes that he's the same silhouette [Music] then we're on the sixth day we're getting ready to go into the millennium soon it shall be time to run out millions will be that now believe that they are saved will be counted fodder for the atomic age miyones by the grace of almighty god by his help to his people that they might look forward to the soon appearing christ okay now let's see what happened with the earth the first two thousand years it was cleansed by water los primeros milanos the next two thousand years christ's blood purchased your salvation milanos la sangre and the last after now listen now after the millennium towards the end then the earth is as burned oura the fire cleanses the earth from all sins now that's the same as a person you need to repent in order to accept this assurance you need to to think right and the baptism of the holy ghost the holy spirit that gives you life el espiritu two types those typos do we understand that parallels now let's go to uh the next slide he does the earth that he's going to use in a plan of redemption it repented and was baptized with water in by noah jesus come and sanctified it by dripping his blood upon it and cleaning it up by joining church or trying to turn a new page but you are a complete brand new unit okay god takes the old man and burns him completely out with the holy ghost and fire and comes himself and sends down your representation diostoma let the mind that was in christ in you the mind that was in christ now let's see what happens in the future now the rapture is going to take place there's going to be a wedding supper for three and a half years the tribulation is going to be here for that same period of time [Music] are you familiar with the sixth seal stan family the sixth year will open up california will go down in the waters in california destructions everywhere those those that are in christ will go in the rapture those that are left behind will have three and a half years of tribulation they'll be hunted down for their testimony they'll be hunted down like dogs sorry but that's what brother branham says that's the return of the bride to do battle with saint and his followers for three and a half years satan and his followers are placed in the bottomless pit for 1 000 years pretty interesting huh now listen to what happens next in order to complete that seventh day para poder complete in terminal we then have satan in the lake of fire forever and forever one last time but in the battle of gaga magog he's he's is beaten and then he's uh placed in the lake of fire forever and forever is so he's placed in the in the lake of fire for a time and jose is collocated we have the great white throne judgment and during that time the world will be proved purified by fire el mondo now do you want to know where you're going to live the new jerusalem will be 1500 miles high the world will see the light of the world isn't that interesting there'll be a light on top of the new jerusalem how can you assure yourself that you're going to be there it's by accepting this blessed assurance in order to accept his blessed assurance we need to repent get baptized be sanctified scientifically get filled with the holy spirit study your assurance plan and we don't want to be hunted down like dogs we're blessed to know this somos benditos there are many people that are running around and reading through the book of revelations and they don't know where they're going to know this by the message of the hours [Music] [Music] now you need to take it do you want the message do you want the assurance remember this is for the youth take this acceptance it's up to you to open it we're in the open age open door age it's up to you to open your door one day that so if you want to make sure you're in the word there's nowhere else for us now i'm going to read to you all this message is from brother abraham it's a three and a half hour message you need you really need to take time off to study it and this this type of message you can't just hear it we have to take notes [Music] and i really i really enjoy studying this i actually got most of my information um [Music] it has a lot of information much information and i really like that i i really like to study that because it gives you an idea of where you're at when you go in a mall and you see a big old map there and it says you are here then you know okay well i need to go over here to get what i want i think that that's really important for us as a church to know where we're at know what it's important to me it's important for me so one day when i when i find it i asked my daughters if they still had it i gave it to them hopefully they'll find it or hopefully i'll find it in my books it's really interesting because you can get into the 70 weeks of daniel daniel uh the history the abraham listoria the abram all these the items you can put them all in a scale like i said we're blessed that we have the message of the house okay we're on uh slide number 16. the positivity says are you guys enjoying this just on this i i like this kind of information if you got eternal life there's only one form that's god and you are an expressed attribute if you if you're not you're not going to be there anyhow no man can come to me except my father has which passes away all things old things but these things don't so i so it speaks of eternity the holy ghost is eternal where you was at the time but you just recognized what happened see you were made from an eternal purpose because you was the manifestation of an attribute that was in god that thought of you and expressed you okay and he made an earth to take you out of and to make you a human being and sin come and along and perverted his way then his purpose rolls on hallelujah oh that does mean so much good think of just what lays ahead okay or after time has been fulfilled and all sin is gone taken away at the millennium at the great white throne judgment a time by the holy ghost after the world is on fire and baptized as baptism of the holy fire from heaven all sin is gone all germs is gone all devils is gone our temptation is gone all evil is gone today [Music] then what does god do he can sit upon the earth see because all sin is gone that's the same thing he does when he gives you the holy ghost baptism with fire you and we can sit in heavenly places in christ jesus because we are all we are already in him not we will be we are now estamos sitting in christ jesus centados increase of jesus how do we get in it by one holy baptism we're all baptized in christ which we are now won't be in christ he's a great spiritual king over the spirit that's in us because we're were in him at the beginning then in this new earth let's look at it for a few minutes now and this new earth the skies will never be black again will never blow across her again like that no she'll never tear up trees and tear up houses and turn over things lightning in their wrath will never bulge from satan across there and kill men walking down the road or burn up a building no more no more there'll be no more typhoon sweep down or storms or tornadoes or tear houses up and kill children and things or tornadoes won't be no more trying to destroy it won't be there anymore sane is just a couple more there's many more uh quotes but i'll just stop now listen close don't forget this that jesus said in john 14 who remembers john 14. he will go to prepare let not your hearts be troubled when he's gone away i'll have a reason to go away you believe in god he said believe also in me el eva a preparatory they couldn't see that he was god said you believe in god now you believe in me i'm going to prepare a place for you don't you want to see what god prepared for you in my father's house is many mansions and my father's kingdom is many pla palaces christ is there under the construction of this new jerusalem now now listen close don't move don't don't miss this christ is in heaven today preparing a new jerusalem attention cristo he's preparing a place for me amen amen just as god created the earth in six days made the earth in six days or six thousand years he as he said be not ignorant we read in the scriptures one thousand years is one as one day ignorance and christ has gone and is preparing a place that's been on its construction for many many thousands of years preparing a place and if i go and prepare a place i will come again and receive you that's wherever i am there you may be also notice the redeemer and the redeemed but we have a policy it's a assurance policy i got those words from brother branham so with all due respect it's up to you to teach it to your children and prepare for it when they were leaving one day those doors are closed just look what's happened in the last couple of years but we need to be ready for it it's your option amen amen would you please uh stand upon blessed assurance tremendous message our future mr futuro heavenly father almighty god we look forward for that resurrection day
