[35:34] me
[35:40] or Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[35:42] today and
[35:46] forever and the spoken
[35:49] word should already be with
[35:54] USA and you remember sister Brenda
[35:57] Rodriguez
[36:00] Rodriguez she was waiting for her
[36:04] baby she didn't know what she was going
[36:06] to
[36:09] have but she felt the presence of the
[36:12] Lord in that
[36:15] Pew and she asked of the Lord and and
[36:18] she
[36:20] said we're asking of a
[36:22] sister and you all know her
[36:28] and she spoke unto the Lord and she
[36:29] asked for a
[36:33] girl can't she even ask her
[36:36] that yeah she can ask for
[36:42] that she said the word she asked for a
[36:45] girl and you know what happened
[36:47] next she had a
[36:50] girl and I praise the Lord for
[36:55] that our brother always reminded
[36:58] us he always reminded
[37:01] us of a grandfather of our sister
[37:07] luer he always remind us that the word
[37:09] is always with
[37:11] us I believe it today in in my
[37:16] heart there is three people that I
[37:18] really
[37:20] love we have here our sister
[37:25] L as you can see just how fragile we
[37:28] are and as you
[37:33] Brethren she was doing something at her
[37:35] home perhaps it was
[37:42] cleaning and she felt a pain in her left
[37:47] side of
[37:48] the next to her
[37:51] shoulder it wouldn't allow her to
[37:53] breathe her properly
[37:57] that the Lord May touch
[38:00] her praise be the name of Lord Jesus
[38:03] Christ and a brother said
[38:06] yesterday and brother asked for
[38:10] three and he said three and he asked for
[38:13] three because with that he will be a
[38:15] great
[38:16] soup we're asking of
[38:19] squirrels you all know them
[38:21] right small animals
[38:24] creatures with three he can probably
[38:26] make a a
[38:29] and I wanted one
[38:30] there it
[38:33] appeared and he shot
[38:36] it and I want another one
[38:38] there and it
[38:40] appeared and he shot
[38:43] it and I wanted the last one there and
[38:46] he shot it because there was a
[38:50] squirrel and he touched
[38:53] them and it was bleeding and there was
[38:56] blood it was real
[38:59] Brethren God is real in this
[39:01] morning name the honor and the
[39:06] glory and then brother brother random
[39:08] with his tumor of his
[39:11] wife he said before the the surgeon
[39:15] K before he went to the
[39:17] hospital for the surgical
[39:21] operation yes he had everything ready
[39:23] and already been there
[39:25] before you already know where the tumor
[39:28] was they were just about to per surgery
[39:31] to remove that
[39:32] tumor but brother Brenham
[39:35] said that before the doctor touched
[39:39] her that you may heal my
[39:43] wife and regardless he still went to the
[39:48] hospital and the woman sister met
[39:52] ready and they brought her into
[39:57] just as the uh surgeons were about to
[39:59] perform the
[40:01] surgy there were no there were no signs
[40:03] of the
[40:06] tumor because brother said that it grew
[40:09] to the size of an
[40:11] apple and it wasn't there
[40:15] anymore and so what day are we living
[40:18] in speak the
[40:23] word and I already had something WR on
[40:25] my finger and I already told you guys in
[40:26] my testimony

[41:21] you you can make that light disappear
[41:23] from my
[41:24] truck whatever what happened to that

[56:45] gospel in the name of the Lord Jesus
[56:47] Christ we ask it amen
[56:53] amen let's go to the word of God uh
[56:56] Hebrews 10
[57:01] chapter4 when you have it you can say
[57:13] Amen says for the law having a
[57:18] shadow it's not just a shadow for there
[57:20] to be a shadow there has to be
[57:23] light so that it can reflect the shadow
[57:26] am
[57:28] amen it's not going to reflect another
[57:31] Shadow it will
[57:33] reflect
[57:36] only at the moment that I Lay My
[57:40] Hand it's reflecting my
[57:45] hand is not reflecting the hand of a
[57:48] CH but my own hand amen
[57:52] amen and the Apostle Paul
[57:58] he writes for the law having a shadow of
[57:59] good things to
[58:02] come and not the very image of the
[58:05] things can
[58:08] never with those
[58:13] sacrifices which they offered year by
[58:15] year
[58:18] continually make
[58:20] perfect make the comers there unto
[58:23] perfect
[58:26] for then would they not have
[58:29] [Music]
[58:30] ceased to be offered because uh those
[58:34] that offer
[58:36] this being purged
[58:42] once because that the worshippers once
[58:49] per but in those sacrifices there is a
[58:52] remembrance again made of sins every
[58:53] year
[59:01] for it is not possible that the blood of
[59:03] bulls and goats should not take away
[59:07] sin now Hebrews 9 verse
[59:10] [Music]
[59:16] 11 but Christ being present and how many
[59:19] believe Christ's
[59:21] presence being becoming a high priest
[59:26] good things to
[59:30] come by a greater more perfect Tac not
[59:34] made with
[59:37] hands that is to say not of this
[59:42] building neither by the blood of goats
[59:44] and Cales or
[59:48] calves but by his own blood hallelujah
[59:54] amen he entered one wants into the holy
[1:00:01] Place having obtained Eternal
[1:00:07] Redemption for if the blood of bulls and
[1:00:16] goats and the ashes of inher sprinkling
[1:00:19] the
[1:00:22] unclean sanctify to the purifying of the
[1:00:24] flesh
[1:00:26] hallelujah how much more
[1:00:29] amen we're in a in a safe
[1:00:33] place how much more shall the blood of
[1:00:37] Christ who through the eternal
[1:00:41] spirit offered
[1:00:43] himself without spot to
[1:00:50] God Purge your conscience from dead
[1:00:53] works for what
[1:00:56] to serve the Living
[1:01:00] God may God add his
[1:01:03] blessing may the Lord bless us this
[1:01:05] morning and may he be
[1:01:09] glorified we may be
[1:01:14] seated we
[1:01:17] know that all the
[1:01:20] promises are in the promised
[1:01:23] land the promised land for us
[1:01:27] is the Holy
[1:01:29] Ghost a moment ago Brother
[1:01:32] Juan was speaking about the spoken
[1:01:35] word God's Prophet said the spoken word
[1:01:39] is the Original
[1:01:42] Seed when Jesus came to the half part of
[1:01:44] the Bible Jesus did not
[1:01:46] come outside of the
[1:01:51] Bible Jesus never came outside of the
[1:01:53] word
[1:01:56] the religious people began to tell
[1:01:59] Jesus you being a man make yourself
[1:02:04] God Jesus only answered one thing he
[1:02:07] said search ye the
[1:02:13] scriptures because from Genesis to
[1:02:16] Malachi they spoke of
[1:02:20] me amen Brothers all the prophets spoke
[1:02:24] of me
[1:02:27] all the
[1:02:30] Patriarchs all types and shadows spoke
[1:02:32] of me amen
[1:02:35] Brothers I am the
[1:02:37] Tabernacle I am the Lamb of
[1:02:42] God I am the one that purges all sin
[1:02:46] amen
[1:02:50] Brothers the Lord Jesus said I am the
[1:02:53] Tabernacle amen Brothers
[1:02:58] they knew what a tabernacle
[1:03:01] was they knew the Tabernacle that Moses
[1:03:04] built
[1:03:07] amen they knew about the
[1:03:10] courts they knew the holy
[1:03:13] place and the holy of holies
[1:03:17] amen but you know
[1:03:19] [Music]
[1:03:23] what the true Tabernacle was now before
[1:03:26] [Music]
[1:03:27] that was only a shadow back then
[1:03:32] amen but the true Tabernacle was in
[1:03:34] front of those men Jesus
[1:03:37] Christ
[1:03:41] amen I
[1:03:46] am the prophet said that's where they
[1:03:53] clashed now he was out of the word when
[1:03:55] he said this Tabernacle is
[1:03:59] I
[1:04:01] he he was not lying he was the true
[1:04:07] Tabernacle now look
[1:04:16] Brothers my subject for this
[1:04:20] morning is the importance of the
[1:04:24] blood the prophet of God God said
[1:04:26] without the blood we're
[1:04:29] lost without the blood there's no
[1:04:32] Rapture without the blood there's no
[1:04:36] salvation without the blood there's no
[1:04:43] reconciliation only the blood can
[1:04:45] appease God's Wrath amen
[1:04:51] Brothers we see that when Cain brought
[1:04:55] he made an altar
[1:05:00] amen and he brought forth the best of
[1:05:02] this
[1:05:03] [Music]
[1:05:05] Earth and he put it before that
[1:05:07] offering
[1:05:10] amen he was thinking by
[1:05:14] Nature that it would be pleasing to
[1:05:17] God but now we can
[1:05:20] see that there was no blood
[1:05:23] there there was no rec ilation that was
[1:05:26] done he was
[1:05:28] lost
[1:05:31] amen and
[1:05:33] brothers
[1:05:35] only it it only looked beautiful
[1:05:40] amen it looked like a
[1:05:43] denomination just a bunch of
[1:05:47] yelling but there was no redemption in
[1:05:50] it there was no forgiveness of
[1:05:54] sins but when it came from
[1:05:58] amen he brought something perfect to God
[1:06:02] he brought something
[1:06:04] true he brought a
[1:06:07] lamb abble put it on the Altar and the
[1:06:10] prophet of God says that he
[1:06:14] took that a sharp
[1:06:17] Stone and he began to strike the
[1:06:20] lamb the
[1:06:23] scene was very ugly
[1:06:26] for for Mankind's eyes
[1:06:30] amen it looked something
[1:06:34] degraded but for God it was something
[1:06:37] beautiful
[1:06:40] amen and we see that there was
[1:06:42] Redemption done there there was
[1:06:48] forgiveness there there was Revelation
[1:06:51] on Abel's
[1:06:52] behalf amen
[1:06:56] now
[1:06:59] notice when those wise
[1:07:03] men we're being led by the
[1:07:07] star how many are being led by a
[1:07:10] star we're being led by a star
[1:07:13] amen but many
[1:07:16] times
[1:07:18] we we start to be we start to follow the
[1:07:22] star and that that star will always lead
[1:07:25] to Jesus that
[1:07:28] star that appeared to the wise
[1:07:34] men were was leading them to the right
[1:07:37] thing to the very
[1:07:40] image it was no longer now
[1:07:44] Shadow but now it was to a
[1:07:48] birth and this star is leading us to a
[1:07:51] birth
[1:07:52] amen we're in that now
[1:07:56] we're in that
[1:07:58] now we're being led by a
[1:08:02] star and a prophet of God said that a
[1:08:06] star it represents a messenger a
[1:08:12] prophet we're being led by God's
[1:08:16] Prophet but many times he
[1:08:18] says that those
[1:08:22] men that that star
[1:08:27] it
[1:08:31] appeared because God was on the
[1:08:34] earth
[1:08:37] amen God was already here on the
[1:08:39] earth for that reason that's why the
[1:08:42] star
[1:08:43] appeared but
[1:08:46] once they came into Jerusalem
[1:08:51] amen when you get wrapped up in your
[1:08:54] thoughts
[1:08:56] and then you turn your back to God's
[1:09:00] word you turn your back on the
[1:09:05] message what I think is better than what
[1:09:07] the prophet
[1:09:09] thinks then that star
[1:09:13] disappeared when they their feet touched
[1:09:16] Jerusalem a type of
[1:09:19] denomination where there were so many
[1:09:21] churches
[1:09:23] there that star was no longer
[1:09:27] when you dive into your own
[1:09:31] thinking then the star will disappear
[1:09:33] from
[1:09:36] you you'll be led by your own
[1:09:39] intellect but
[1:09:41] brother God's Prophet says that those
[1:09:45] wise
[1:09:47] men they
[1:09:51] thought when they reached Jerusalem
[1:09:57] they would at Jerusalem would be
[1:09:58] feasting and
[1:10:02] rejoicing because the king of King was
[1:10:04] not born on the
[1:10:07] Earth but we find out they were they
[1:10:09] were not aware what
[1:10:11] happened they arrived asking where is he
[1:10:14] King of the Jews where is he that is
[1:10:17] Born the one that we waited for so
[1:10:22] long amen Brothers
[1:10:26] uh but they didn't know Herod didn't
[1:10:29] know everything was confused
[1:10:34] amen but we see once they got
[1:10:37] out of
[1:10:39] Jerusalem the SAR reappeared hallelujah
[1:10:44] amen praise God
[1:10:48] Brothers now
[1:10:53] notice and
[1:10:56] in the
[1:11:01] [Music]
[1:11:11] message in the message God does not
[1:11:13] change his way of thinking when word the
[1:11:16] prophet of God
[1:11:18] say if that's how it was in the
[1:11:21] beginning that's how it has to be today
[1:11:23] am amen
[1:11:29] we were with God since before the
[1:11:30] foundation of the world how many believe
[1:11:35] that you have to see yourself in every
[1:11:40] scripture once one
[1:11:43] time the Lord told job he says he said
[1:11:46] job G yourself about in your loins
[1:11:48] because I will ask you something I will
[1:11:50] ask you something where were you
[1:11:53] Jo when I was shaping the the heavens
[1:11:56] and the
[1:11:58] Earth
[1:12:04] amen the prophet says that means that
[1:12:06] job was found in some
[1:12:10] place even when job was not born here in
[1:12:14] this
[1:12:17] flesh so then if God is asking him where
[1:12:19] were
[1:12:21] you that means that he once was
[1:12:23] somewhere else amen
[1:12:28] amen we were once in the mind of
[1:12:33] God the prophet of God
[1:12:42] says the prophet says that Moses wrote
[1:12:45] Genesis exus Deuteronomy and numbers but
[1:12:47] he did not live in that
[1:12:50] time but he was the prophet of God Amen
[1:12:56] he had a wider
[1:12:59] Vision than the people he could see
[1:13:03] things that he didn't see in his
[1:13:05] lifetime he
[1:13:06] saw but God would show it to him
[1:13:11] nevertheless in Genesis chapter 1 he
[1:13:13] began to
[1:13:14] say God
[1:13:17] created the heavens and the
[1:13:19] Earth
[1:13:24] amen but we now we see another prophet
[1:13:26] of
[1:13:27] God John the
[1:13:30] Baptist with a wider Vision
[1:13:34] amen and John began to say that in the
[1:13:39] beginning was the word
[1:13:42] amen and the Word was God amen
[1:13:48] amen and that word was made flesh and
[1:13:51] dwelt Among Us amen
[1:13:57] but today currently we have a
[1:14:00] prophet that had a wider Vision
[1:14:06] amen and he said that we were in the
[1:14:08] mind of
[1:14:10] Christ before the foundation of the
[1:14:13] world
[1:14:16] everyone everyone saw from the
[1:14:18] foundation up to
[1:14:19] here but this
[1:14:23] Prophet an
[1:14:27] Vision could take us Way Beyond
[1:14:30] time when there was no time in eternity
[1:14:36] Brothers praise the
[1:14:38] Lord now
[1:14:43] notice I I want to focus more on the
[1:14:48] subject the prophet of God says
[1:15:00] he says
[1:15:04] now the most important chapter for
[1:15:08] us for the Bride of the
[1:15:10] Lord for the end
[1:15:16] time the most important or outstanding
[1:15:19] chapter could be John
[1:15:21] 3:16 amen
[1:15:25] God so loved the world that he gave his
[1:15:27] only begotten
[1:15:29] son for whosoever believeth in him shall
[1:15:32] not perish but have everlasting
[1:15:35] life but did you know there's even a
[1:15:37] more
[1:15:39] important Revelations chapter
[1:15:43] 5 did you know if he would not have
[1:15:46] come to claim and take the book and
[1:15:50] break the
[1:15:51] seals then you and I would be lost
[1:15:56] it would it would do us no good to be
[1:15:58] here everything would be in vain
[1:16:01] amen now
[1:16:05] notice we
[1:16:08] see that Revelation 1 chapter 2 chapter
[1:16:15] 3 speak of the seven Church ages
[1:16:19] amen but we
[1:16:21] see that chapter
[1:16:23] four speaks of a Rapture
[1:16:28] amen it speaks of a voice that John
[1:16:34] raptured and he said come up
[1:16:40] amen and the prophet of God said that's
[1:16:42] the bride's
[1:16:45] chapter that chapter four is for the
[1:16:48] bride but in chapter five
[1:16:55] it speaks of
[1:17:12] a it speaks of an atonement or
[1:17:22] a it speaks of a claim being made
[1:17:27] we see that in chapter
[1:17:29] five a voice is heard who is worthy Amen
[1:17:34] to open the
[1:17:35] book and to lose the Seven Seals thereof
[1:17:38] amen now no the prophet of God
[1:17:44] says if that book was never
[1:17:48] taken by the King of Kings the Lord of
[1:17:51] lords everything would have been lost
[1:17:53] amen amen Brothers
[1:18:00] it says that no one was worthy not in
[1:18:04] heaven or in
[1:18:08] Earth neither
[1:18:10] Gabriel neither
[1:18:12] Michael Nor the
[1:18:14] cherubin nor the archangels nor
[1:18:19] seraphim none was worthy it
[1:18:22] says in Earth
[1:18:24] NE neither Adam neither Enoch nor Noah
[1:18:30] neither Jeremiah neither
[1:18:33] Moses not even John the
[1:18:38] Baptist because if there was none Worthy
[1:18:40] on the
[1:18:41] earth is because these were mere
[1:18:44] mortals
[1:18:48] amen nor beneath the Earth not even sat
[1:18:51] or his
[1:18:52] demons nor his spirits
[1:18:55] were
[1:19:00] worthy and it says that John began to
[1:19:04] weep but why was John
[1:19:07] weeping in the message the
[1:19:13] breach between the seven Church ages and
[1:19:16] the
[1:19:18] Seven paragraph
[1:19:21] 166 now look
[1:19:25] what the prophet of God
[1:19:32] says he says but
[1:19:34] John
[1:19:38] wept the prophet of God says here's what
[1:19:41] I
[1:19:43] think he wept
[1:19:49] for because if no one was worthy and
[1:19:51] could open this book of redemption
[1:19:53] that's something tremendous
[1:20:02] if no one was worthy and could open this
[1:20:04] book of
[1:20:05] redemption the whole
[1:20:09] creation was
[1:20:12] lost
[1:20:13] amen now I ask
[1:20:16] you would John be
[1:20:19] lost he would have been amen
[1:20:23] amen if God would not have
[1:20:26] come who would then claim the
[1:20:31] book who would open it and and break the
[1:20:34] seal John and all of us in this morning
[1:20:38] we would be
[1:20:41] lost but thank
[1:20:44] God that God stood in the
[1:20:48] breach put one foot on the
[1:20:50] earth one foot on the
[1:20:53] sea and he said time shall be more one
[1:20:58] moment then thank God for
[1:21:00] that he sent us a
[1:21:03] prophet that stood in the prach and
[1:21:05] could say he said just one
[1:21:08] moment I still

[1:34:29] only in chapter 15 in the book of First
[1:34:32] Corinthians the prophet of God
[1:34:37] says that he emphasized even more on the
[1:34:41] resurrection of Jesus than on the death
[1:34:42] of Jesus Christ and now
[1:34:45] why we
[1:34:49] see that if he
[1:34:52] died amen

[1:35:22] resurrection
[1:35:25] then all that would have been

[1:36:19] worst of demons once she was set free
[1:36:24] she could see the resurrection of
[1:36:25] Jesus we have been set free of all those
[1:36:31] Spirits we're waiting to see the
[1:36:39] resurrection let's go to First
[1:36:49] Corinthians First Corinthians
[1:36:57] chapter 15 I'm about to
[1:37:02] close uh uh 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:37:06] 15 verse
[1:37:09] 12 to verse
[1:37:18] 19 can we read
[1:37:22] it it says like
[1:37:24] this the entire chapter
[1:37:30] 15 all that the Apostle Paul could speak
[1:37:33] and
[1:37:35] say was of the resurrection of
[1:37:38] Jesus now look at what he
[1:37:42] says he says now if
[1:37:46] Christ now if Christ be
[1:37:49] preached that he rose from the dead
[1:37:55] how say some among
[1:37:57] [Music]
[1:37:59] you that there is no resurrection of the
[1:38:04] Dead for if there be no resurrection of
[1:38:07] the
[1:38:09] dead then is Christ not
[1:38:13] risen tremendous how
[1:38:16] tremendous
[1:38:21] amen and if Christ be not
[1:38:26] risen then is our preaching
[1:38:30] vain it's in vain to be
[1:38:35] here and your faith is also
[1:38:38] vain amen
[1:38:44] amen yay and we are found false
[1:38:46] Witnesses of
[1:38:50] God because we have testified of God
[1:38:53] [Music]
[1:38:56] that he raised up
[1:38:58] Christ whom he raised not
[1:39:01] up if so be that the dead rise
[1:39:06] not for if the dead rise
[1:39:09] not then is not Christ
[1:39:15] raised and if Christ be not
[1:39:18] raised your faith is vain
[1:39:23] ye are yet in your
[1:39:28] sins then they also which are fallen
[1:39:32] asleep in Christ are
[1:39:36] perished if in this life only we have
[1:39:40] hope in
[1:39:43] Christ we are of all men most
[1:39:46] miserable how
[1:39:50] tremendous if Christ be not risen from
[1:39:52] among the Dead
[1:39:55] then our beloved ones that are in the
[1:39:57] grave are
[1:40:01] lost along with
[1:40:03] us amen
[1:40:06] Brothers but we thank
[1:40:10] God that one day like today in the
[1:40:12] morning
[1:40:15] amen two women went to the
[1:40:20] grave and they could only find the
[1:40:22] Linens
[1:40:28] and an angel was only there was waiting
[1:40:31] there to give them the
[1:40:34] message the
[1:40:37] angel was waiting for those two women
[1:40:40] and said whom seek
[1:40:43] ye whom seek
[1:40:46] ye for he has
[1:40:49] risen he has
[1:40:51] risen and in this morning
[1:40:55] he is here present Among
[1:40:57] Us that's why any disease any
[1:41:02] problem is
[1:41:04] resolved when we're under the blood
[1:41:07] everything is made
[1:41:12] perfect that's why brother Bram said to
[1:41:14] his sister speak the
[1:41:16] [Music]
[1:41:17] word ask ask he
[1:41:21] said because she was in the right place
[1:41:25] he was speaking about the squirrels
[1:41:27] amen and the prophet
[1:41:29] said those uh squirrels were not a
[1:41:33] vision he says I ate them
[1:41:38] amen he said you cannot eat a vision
[1:41:42] amen and what was
[1:41:45] it the resurrection of those two young
[1:41:49] boys a spiritual Resurrection because
[1:41:51] they were mocking him
[1:41:58] in the message mother days I'll close
[1:42:00] with this if we can please
[1:42:06] stand preached on May the 10th of
[1:42:14] 1959 paragraph 52 the prophet
[1:42:19] says the prophet of God said
[1:42:28] the musicians can
[1:42:32] come I felt like I was at
[1:42:35] home at the very beginning I was very
[1:42:37] nervous but the
[1:42:39] Lord he he gave me
[1:42:42] liberty the lord loves us so much he
[1:42:45] still
[1:42:46] loves it will love us for all
[1:42:49] [Music]
[1:42:51] eternity someone told the prophet
[1:42:56] You Preach too much on the
[1:43:00] resurrection You Preach too much on the
[1:43:06] resurrection most every message has got
[1:43:09] something about the
[1:43:11] resurrection why
[1:43:18] sure it's the Cardinal resting place of
[1:43:21] the Gospel
[1:43:24] no matter what he
[1:43:27] did if he did not rise again from the
[1:43:32] dead then all of it was in
[1:43:37] vain it to me proves that he was
[1:43:39] [Music]
[1:43:41] God proves every claim he
[1:43:46] made the
[1:43:51] resurrection and it also is the place of
[1:43:53] resting of the
[1:43:55] [Music]
[1:43:57] Soul it's the starting
[1:44:01] point is the crowning of our
[1:44:08] consolation and when we see that he rose
[1:44:10] from the
[1:44:11] dead it places
[1:44:14] us with the gospel
[1:44:18] armor at the
[1:44:21] Battlefront to take take the place to
[1:44:25] fight for we
[1:44:27] know he
[1:44:30] said he that will lose his
[1:44:32] life for my
[1:44:35] sake shall find it
[1:44:40] again and I think it's the great
[1:44:42] coronation of the
[1:44:44] Full
[1:44:46] Gospel is the
[1:44:49] resurrection and its Divine promises
[1:44:54] and the
[1:44:57] consolation that it gives to those who
[1:44:59] are trusting in
[1:45:01] [Music]
[1:45:03] it for it promises the great Union of
[1:45:06] our uniting together
[1:45:09] [Music]
[1:45:12] again it promises and the fading away of
[1:45:15] all
[1:45:17] [Music]
[1:45:20] sin it promises the fading away of all
[1:45:22] deformity
[1:45:24] all the
[1:45:27] sufferings that we have did in
[1:45:31] this had to go through
[1:45:34] with in this
[1:45:36] life it
[1:45:40] [Music]
[1:45:41] promises and the vanishing of its
[1:45:46] all it promises that even death will
[1:45:49] lose its hold
[1:45:53] and will rise in the likeness of
[1:45:56] Jesus so to my
[1:46:00] opinion the resurrection is the greatest
[1:46:04] of all the
[1:46:06] promises in the things of the
[1:46:09] scripture there is where it sealed
[1:46:12] it and the last
[1:46:16] [Music]
[1:46:17] Easter when I was preaching on the five
[1:46:20] things
[1:46:21] of
[1:46:23] living he loved
[1:46:25] me
[1:46:27] dying he saved
[1:46:30] me
[1:46:32] [Music]
[1:46:34] buried he carried my sins far away but
[1:46:39] Rising he
[1:46:42] justified
[1:46:43] freely
[1:46:47] forever that's the day for
[1:46:49] me Isn't that the day for you
[1:46:53] that's the day for
[1:46:55] me that great day of
[1:46:59] days and to see what it what it'll mean
[1:47:03] to all of us in the
[1:47:06] resurrection as we labor and
[1:47:10] wait for that blessed day day of
[1:47:15] days how many are waiting for that
[1:47:18] day every tear will be wiped away
[1:47:23] every tear will no longer be of Sorrow
[1:47:25] of
[1:47:26] loneliness of persecution of
[1:47:29] pain but rather will be tears of
[1:47:34] [Music]
[1:47:35] joy as we see each other in that table
[1:47:38] of Eternity as we see each other hugging
