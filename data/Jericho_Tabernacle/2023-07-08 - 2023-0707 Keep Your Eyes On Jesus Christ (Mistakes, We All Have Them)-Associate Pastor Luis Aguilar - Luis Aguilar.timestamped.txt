[38:02] we all have them
[38:06] they know that the devil he sold he's a
[38:09] really good adversary
[38:12] adversario and his goal is
[38:16] for us to take her eyes off of Jesus
[38:19] Christ

[38:24] that's in his reach
[38:28] to get a son or a daughter foreign

[38:55] I can go home
[38:57] as long as I can get their eyes off of
[39:00] Jesus Christ
[39:04] that's all I need to do is
[39:07] he will use time he'll use materials
[39:12] he will use mistakes
[39:15] for us to take our eyes off of Jesus
[39:17] Christ
[39:24] are we looking at the man or are we
[39:26] looking at Jesus Christ
[39:32] as your eyes on the song leader or Jesus
[39:36] Christ

[39:42] suits the same exact suit all the time

[39:58] the devil is so good at his job
[40:03] even when we come to service
[40:06] you'll have us to take our eyes off the
[40:09] world
[40:11] and use anything
[40:13] sound systems
[40:18] Antonio
[40:28] amen amen so let's keep our eyes on
[40:32] Jesus Christ
[40:39] not on time but on Jesus Christ
[40:44] amen the scripture says look on to me
[40:49] who is he talking about is it Isaiah
[40:52] saying look on to Isaiah
[40:55] it's God
[40:57] through the prophet Isaiah
[41:00] I said look on to me
[41:04] the Lord thy God
[41:07] he said and be saved if you say he said
[41:10] salvos all the ends of the Earth
[41:14] for I am God
[41:17] he's not
[41:38] know that we know that the children of
[41:40] Israel where they're in the wilderness
[41:44] what do they do they begin to complain
[41:48] their eyes were not on the pillar of
[41:51] fire
[41:53] their eyes
[42:00] what did you even take us out of here
[42:02] anyways
[42:44] because that serpent is a type of Christ
[42:48] I don't know if this is true or not
[42:51] say the only cure for a deadly serpent
[42:56] that bites you this is
[43:00] the Venom itself
[43:03] I don't know that's true I'm not a
[43:05] scientists
[43:07] but you notice that that that Satan in
[43:10] the beginning of Genesis was a serpentes
[43:15] and here Jesus Christ is a type he's a
[43:19] serpent yeah
[43:21] but he is a brass serpent foreign
[43:31] meet in and live everyone to keep our
[43:34] eyes on that on Jesus Christ foreign
[44:06] so the here from the get-go this is the
[44:10] holy spirit is revealing on to me
[44:13] I don't know if it's revealing unto you
[44:16] it is revealing on to me he says we make
[44:20] mistakes
[44:27] okay I'm going to say that again
[44:30] we make mistakes you
[44:45] because you're always
[44:52] amen amen oh so after I get baptized I'm
[44:56] still gonna make mistakes
[44:59] even I've been in the church for 15 20
[45:01] years I'm still going to make mistakes
[45:03] on this place is
[45:06] you're always
[45:14] but don't look at them
[45:16] look at the mistakes
[45:18] but you see
[45:20] it's following his rules
[45:53] [Music]
[46:00] a real true servant this is
[46:08] he'll get up again
[46:12] so it's not about the mistakes
[46:18] thank God for the message
[46:21] now I feel good because if someone makes
[46:25] mistakes
[46:27] you're looking at them
[46:31] a real true servant um
[46:35] he'll get up again
[46:38] if he wobbles a bit
[46:41] God pulls them right back in the past
[46:45] [Music]
[46:46] as long as he's in the path of Duty
[46:52] oh so we have to be somewhere
[46:55] in that line of duty we have to be in
[47:00] his words
[47:01] because sometimes following his word
[47:05] we make mistakes
[47:08] trying to follow his words
[47:11] we have the message before us
[47:14] and it's a hard thing to live that
[47:17] message
[47:18] and you're going to make mistakes when
[47:21] you try to follow that message
[47:24] says he's going to pull you right back
[47:29] as long long as you're in the path of
[47:32] Duty
[47:35] but if he's off the path of Duty
[47:41] God's not obligated to him
[47:45] oh so we have to be somewhere
[47:53] God has called you
[47:55] and say oh sister you you're a sinner
[47:58] you got to repent do you say oh yes
[48:02] you have to receive the Holy Ghost
[48:35] [Music]
[48:56] oh so we have to be
[48:58] [Music]
[49:06] we make the mistake
[49:10] God's gonna say okay just come right
[49:12] back
[49:15] if we are duties
[49:19] God's not obligated
[49:23] but as long as he's in the path to
[49:26] duties wow
[49:34] God's obligated obligated
[49:41] that he is just a man or a woman
[49:46] see God knows and God understands that
[49:51] we're human beings
[49:52] he understands
[49:55] he understands that you're a woman
[49:58] he knows that one of these days
[50:03] we're going to make mistakes
[50:07] knowing that we're just a man and woman
[50:09] he says okay this is
[50:12] obligated to that
[50:15] Persona as long as they're in a path of
[50:18] Duty
[50:23] we're always going to have them
[50:28] now
[50:31] we're we are all going to make mistakes
[50:37] that makes me feel good
[50:40] because sometimes I look myself in the
[50:42] mirror
[50:44] and I feel like I'm the only one in this
[50:46] boat yeah
[50:48] and the boat says
[50:52] you know you had some certain Boat Type
[50:55] names
[51:15] oh so I have buddies with me in the same
[51:18] city
[51:22] amen amen amen amen we're all going to
[51:26] make mistakes
[51:28] just remember and when you're going to
[51:32] look at one another
[51:35] um
[51:36] don't look at the other person's mistake
[51:39] de lotro
[51:41] were you going to look at somebody
[51:44] don't look at the other person's
[51:47] mistakes
[51:49] see don't do that
[51:52] because remember mistakes
[52:02] amen amen
[52:04] they don't do that because you make
[52:07] mistakes
[52:09] but look
[52:11] to Christ who's guiding that person
[52:16] that person's trying to serve Christ
[52:20] he's in the line of duty
[52:24] she's trying to do something yes
[52:28] we're gonna make mistakes as we go
[52:32] but as long as we're in that line of
[52:35] duty
[52:37] God's gonna pick them right back up
[52:40] and you know what's going to happen
[52:43] we're going to gain experience
[52:54] for the benefit of the kingdom of God
[52:59] amen amen but look who's in that person
[53:02] look that it's Christ guiding that
[53:04] person
[53:12] [Music]
[53:36] when you're praying for somebody else
[53:39] so if we're sick
[53:41] in our body and our soul and our mind
[53:46] your spirit when we pray for somebody
[53:51] God's going to heal you
[53:54] that's what the prophet says
[53:58] when you're praying for somebody else
[54:00] that's right I see yes that's what
[54:03] Christianity is based upon
[54:07] to help one another
[54:12] do for one another
[54:15] be kind to one another
[54:19] understanding one another
[54:21] now if you see your neighbor's mistakes
[54:25] you see where they went wrong
[54:28] don't go wrong with them
[54:31] but just pray for them
[54:34] just keep praying and God will
[54:37] understand that is
[54:42] we all have them and you see the devil
[54:45] is so good at his job
[54:49] make us look at mistakes
[54:56] I got a list right here how long how
[54:59] many mistakes
[55:08] and the scroll says
[55:14] there goes
[55:16] all the way to the back
[55:20] he said
[55:29] but you know what God does
[55:31] he grabs that roll
[55:35] he grabs it is waiting for me
[55:39] to confess my mistakes
[55:50] and get back in the line of duty
[55:53] when I do that
[55:56] I have to do it first
[55:59] I have to do that first
[56:05] in the lake
[56:21] [Music]
[56:29] it says like this is
[56:32] now here's Jesus talking to his
[56:34] disciples
[56:36] and straightway Jesus constrained his
[56:39] disciples to get into a ship and go and
[56:43] to go before him on to the other side
[56:44] while he went to the multitudes away and
[56:47] he sent the multitudes away
[56:56] now notice now Jesus is giving his
[57:01] disciples an order
[57:06] he said he constrained his disciples
[57:13] or he ordered his disciples
[57:16] get on a ship and to go without him
[57:22] while he stays behind
[57:26] and now verse 23 and when he had sent
[57:29] the multitude away he went up into a
[57:31] mountain part to pray and the evening
[57:33] was coming he was there alone solo
[57:42] and now verse 24 but the ship was now in
[57:45] the midst of the sea tossed with ways
[57:49] for the wind was contrary you say is
[58:00] what key number one
[58:03] Jesus gives them an order Jesus the same
[58:07] thing when God gives us the message
[58:10] he told them what to do they obeyed and
[58:15] now what what happened
[58:17] their ship was in the middle of the sea
[58:20] and the ship was being tossed by the
[58:23] waves
[58:27] for the win was contrary
[58:32] now notice when God tells you something
[58:35] to do
[58:37] when he tells you through his message
[58:40] what to do
[58:42] contrario
[58:51] that's always the way it's going to be
[58:54] when God gives you a message
[58:57] when God sends you somewhere when God
[59:01] calls you to get baptized if you want to
[59:03] get baptized
[59:05] or you want to receive the Holy Ghost
[59:08] what happened
[59:10] things start to go wrong
[59:15] because who controls the wind
[59:18] the Devil Himself Diablo
[59:22] that principalities and high places that
[59:24] we don't see Los principals
[59:29] the devil was controlling the wind that
[59:32] was contrary
[59:35] and on the verse 25 and uh and in the
[59:39] Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went
[59:40] unto them walking on the scene
[59:45] Jesus and
[59:48] when the disciples saw him walking on
[59:50] the sea they were trouble saying it is
[59:52] it is a spirit and they cry out for fear
[1:00:01] but straightway Jesus spake unto them
[1:00:04] saying be of good cheer it is I Be not
[1:00:06] Afraid
[1:00:11] and Peter answered him and said Lord if
[1:00:14] it be thou bid me on bid me come unto
[1:00:17] thee on the water is
[1:00:24] now notice
[1:00:26] it was Peter Pedro that asked Jesus to
[1:00:30] get on the water Jesus
[1:00:33] it was Peter that said it first
[1:00:37] or let me go in the waters
[1:00:45] and when Peter would come down under the
[1:00:47] ship he walked out of the water to Jesus
[1:00:52] but when he saw the wind
[1:01:05] he was afraid he said he began to sink
[1:01:10] and he cried saying Lord save me
[1:01:14] and admittedly Jesus stretched forth his
[1:01:17] hand and caught him and said unto him oh
[1:01:19] thou little faith wherefore there is
[1:01:22] thou doubt
[1:01:23] Jesus
[1:01:28] now he was in the waters
[1:01:31] but he was looking unto Jesus Christ
[1:01:36] but the wind started to hit him very
[1:01:38] contrary
[1:01:45] that Satan gives
[1:01:47] and he began to look at the winds
[1:01:51] instead of looking at Jesus Christ
[1:01:56] sometimes we you know what we just have
[1:01:58] to look in our eye look at our eyes of
[1:02:00] Jesus Christ
[1:02:02] don't look at nothing else
[1:02:06] point of Doctrine uh
[1:02:09] they teach that or they teach this is
[1:02:14] keep your eyes on Jesus Christ
[1:02:18] he is the message
[1:02:21] [Music]
[1:02:26] just keep your eyes on him
[1:02:29] he will take you to the right place
[1:02:34] I'd rather be wrong in my Doctrine this
[1:02:38] is
[1:02:42] teachings and so forth I rather be wrong
[1:02:46] and that is
[1:02:47] but I'd rather have a good spirit
[1:02:52] then rather have be right in my Doctrine
[1:02:57] wrong in my
[1:03:01] [Music]
[1:03:12] so where do we have to have our eyes on
[1:03:17] Jesus Christ
[1:03:19] nothing else
[1:03:22] no no just on Jesus Christ
[1:03:26] remember the devil will use any
[1:03:36] because they talk about
[1:03:38] their mistakes about here everybody
[1:03:39] makes mistakes
[1:03:44] I come to church because Jesus saved me
[1:03:49] Jesus because he saved me does he love
[1:03:53] me when no one else did
[1:03:59] I don't come here because of the
[1:04:00] mistakes
[1:04:02] no no we don't look at them
[1:04:05] that's what all the devil wants to do
[1:04:09] you see what that
[1:04:10] [Music]
[1:04:22] it's only on Jesus Christ nothing else
[1:04:27] well the brother made the mistake
[1:04:30] he fell he made a mistake
[1:04:34] oh he's human
[1:04:37] he's saved by grace man amen so you see
[1:04:42] that Peter Pedro took his life of all
[1:04:45] his eyes off of Jesus Christ
[1:04:47] and look at the wind
[1:04:52] Peter brother Ram says decent amount of
[1:04:54] Branham Peter was all steamed up one
[1:04:56] night he said
[1:04:59] on the scene
[1:05:01] and when he got into desperation
[1:05:05] and he began to cry out
[1:05:07] there's there's there is something wrong
[1:05:11] I see a Spirit come walking to me
[1:05:15] and the ship was about to go down
[1:05:19] he said if it'd be you Lord pay me to
[1:05:22] come with you on the water because
[1:05:26] and he stepped down out of the ship and
[1:05:28] started
[1:05:30] and he got scared when he's when he's
[1:05:33] when he got started
[1:05:37] to sing
[1:05:39] sometimes we feel like that yeah
[1:05:41] or mistakes
[1:05:44] makes us feel like we're thinking
[1:05:48] I made this mistake
[1:05:52] recordia
[1:06:23] [Music]
[1:06:32] [Music]
[1:06:41] revelation
[1:06:46] [Music]
[1:07:13] I'm going to say that again because the
[1:07:15] what he is scared of
[1:07:17] the little that you do know
[1:07:22] you put it into
[1:07:24] actions
[1:07:28] because Revelations
[1:07:34] and it took one little Stone
[1:07:37] one little Revelation
[1:07:40] a big one
[1:07:42] little revelation
[1:07:48] it's not about knowledge
[1:07:50] it's about Revelation
[1:07:52] a revelation Revelation but it's not
[1:07:55] about the other brothers
[1:07:59] it's about God's grace
[1:08:03] still Grace
[1:08:16] amen amen
[1:08:19] brother Branham says
[1:08:21] though a mistake this is
[1:08:25] trying to follow the Commandments of God
[1:08:30] so Peter made a mistake he aired he
[1:08:35] failed
[1:08:38] Jesus said
[1:08:40] and what did Peter fell Pedro he made a
[1:08:45] mistake in trying to follow God's
[1:08:48] commands
[1:08:50] brother says I hope the church gets that
[1:08:55] this is
[1:09:01] it says I hope the church if you go to
[1:09:04] the next light sister
[1:09:06] there you go it says I hope the church
[1:09:09] gets that if they say okay
[1:09:11] the man el hombre was doing what God
[1:09:15] told him to do is
[1:09:32] [Music]
[1:09:39] because he was in a line of duty
[1:09:44] he was trying to follow what God told
[1:09:46] him
[1:09:49] and it's hard to follow what God tells
[1:09:52] us to do yeah
[1:09:54] this message is
[1:09:59] but we make mistakes as we're trying to
[1:10:02] get there
[1:10:05] but God sees the mistake
[1:10:11] God pulls us right back
[1:10:14] no you're my son you get back up
[1:10:18] that's where I want to stay stay in
[1:10:20] God's word
[1:10:28] that's fine
[1:10:29] God's obligated to you bye
[1:10:34] pero
[1:10:37] Al moment
[1:10:48] let's go to First Kings
[1:10:50] you love the Lord
[1:10:53] keep your eyes on Jesus Christ
[1:10:57] First Kings the 19th Chapter
[1:11:03] 1919
[1:11:05] so here
[1:11:08] Elias
[1:11:16] it says like this is
[1:11:18] so he Departed thence and found Elisha
[1:11:21] the son of Shabbat or who was plowing
[1:11:25] with 12 yoke of oxen before him and he
[1:11:28] with the twelfth and Elijah passed by
[1:11:30] him and cast his mantle upon him
[1:11:43] so what do we what do we find here
[1:11:47] let's take it step by step
[1:11:50] so here a key we find that Elisha
[1:11:56] here he's plowing the ground he's
[1:11:58] working in the field
[1:12:02] and he has 12 auctions
[1:12:06] and he's on the 12th one yes
[1:12:10] there he is working the ground
[1:12:14] never thought much of what God had for
[1:12:17] him
[1:12:20] profeta
[1:12:27] Elijah Elias and he saw
[1:12:31] elishao and he grabs he takes off his
[1:12:34] mantle izakita sumanto and puts it on
[1:12:37] top of Elijah
[1:12:41] and notice
[1:12:43] and he left excuse me in the 20th 20th
[1:12:46] verse and he left the oxen and ran after
[1:12:48] Elijah and said let me I pray thee kiss
[1:12:51] my father and my mother then I will
[1:12:53] follow thee and he said unto him go back
[1:12:55] again for what have I done today
[1:12:59] is
[1:13:12] Elijah takes off the mantle off of
[1:13:15] Elisha yeah
[1:13:17] they're Elijah recognized that God was
[1:13:21] calling him
[1:13:23] so then Elijah said well let me first
[1:13:28] let me kiss my father and my mother
[1:13:30] goodbye
[1:13:32] Madre Elijah said
[1:13:35] go back I'm not stopping you don't you
[1:13:38] know
[1:13:43] and he returned back from him and he
[1:13:45] took a yoke of oxen and slew them and
[1:13:47] boiled their flesh with the instruments
[1:13:49] of The Oxen and gave on to the people
[1:13:51] and they did eat and then he arose and
[1:13:53] went after Elijah and ministered onto
[1:13:55] him we say is
[1:14:06] so then here Elisha realized
[1:14:10] that this is not time for him to go back
[1:14:13] and say goodbye to Mom and Dad
[1:14:18] so what he did he sacrificed those
[1:14:20] accents
[1:14:23] use
[1:14:27] and he got rid of it all and he followed
[1:14:31] Elijah
[1:14:33] Alias now brother Branham says
[1:14:36] that that he put the mantle
[1:14:40] over Elijah
[1:14:42] that's what it said right there on the
[1:14:45] on the 19th verse I look at this
[1:14:48] mother says it took Elijah
[1:14:53] for 10 years
[1:14:56] for that mentota fit Elijah
[1:15:00] it took him 10 years
[1:15:03] because it wasn't that the man who had
[1:15:06] to fit Elisha
[1:15:10] had to fit the mantle Elise
[1:15:14] the God God's word doesn't have to fit
[1:15:17] us
[1:15:20] we have to fit in God's word
[1:15:24] and it took Elisha 10 years yes
[1:15:29] to follow Elijah so follow him to be
[1:15:33] right right next to him
[1:15:35] you imagine
[1:15:38] studying under the feet of Elijah
[1:15:59] took him 10 years
[1:16:03] now it wasn't that the mantle was
[1:16:04] something special
[1:16:07] it was just a robe
[1:16:10] but he was the Holy Spirit
[1:16:16] it's not the mountain that's holy
[1:16:20] it's the Holy Ghost on the mountains
[1:16:25] when Jesus was coming into the city of
[1:16:28] Jerusalem with a donkey because
[1:16:37] it was Jesus on top of the donkey no
[1:16:39] Iraq Jesus
[1:16:43] so we find that when we want to follow
[1:16:45] Jesus Christ
[1:16:48] we find that
[1:16:50] those those potential disciples wanted
[1:16:53] to follow Jesus
[1:16:57] they told Jesus well let me say Let me
[1:17:00] let me get married first
[1:17:06] let me let me bury the dead first
[1:17:10] episode
[1:17:14] let me say goodbye to my father and my
[1:17:17] mother he said
[1:17:18] [Music]
[1:17:21] we're now willing to leave father or
[1:17:24] mothers not worthy of the kingdom of God
[1:17:30] then we find later on in the scriptures
[1:17:35] that were Elisha it was his time to go
[1:17:38] okay
[1:17:43] he was tired
[1:17:46] and he told Elijah you know I'm gonna go
[1:17:49] right
[1:17:51] yeah I know he said just get back
[1:17:56] I'm not going to leave you know
[1:17:59] as long as your soul lives he said and
[1:18:03] if the father lives
[1:18:04] I will not leave
[1:18:07] to stand right next to the message
[1:18:11] and right next to Jesus Christ
[1:18:14] for all the critics they gave Elijah
[1:18:21] and how many times
[1:18:23] did Elijah told Elisha to go back
[1:18:27] how many times
[1:18:32] Juan Una
[1:18:35] to those three times
[1:18:39] Perfection Perfection
[1:18:41] Eliza told them three times
[1:18:44] I will not leave
[1:18:46] I'm going to be right here
[1:18:50] brother Branham says that Elijah okay
[1:18:53] Elias
[1:18:56] he tried to discourage Elijah
[1:19:01] try to get out of here go just go back
[1:19:06] to see what Elisha would do
[1:19:10] that's what those mistakes do is
[1:19:19] mistakes here there's mistakes there at
[1:19:21] the church
[1:19:26] to discourage
[1:19:30] let's see if he'll go back
[1:19:32] Elijah said I'm not going back
[1:19:35] I'm going to stay right here
[1:19:39] thick and thin I'm going to be right
[1:19:41] here okay
[1:19:48] Elijah had his Association or Elisha
[1:19:51] with Elijah Association
[1:19:57] that Great Mighty Prophet is
[1:19:59] do you remember how Elijah called him he
[1:20:02] threw his mantle over him and followed
[1:20:03] him to gilgal and to many places
[1:20:05] [Music]
[1:20:12] and I want you to notice how Elisha knew
[1:20:17] that he was going to be called The
[1:20:18] Prophet The Prophet Elijah said
[1:20:23] [Music]
[1:20:27] Elijah tried in a roundabout way to
[1:20:30] leave Elisha behind Elias
[1:20:36] and another message brother said he
[1:20:38] tried to discourage him
[1:20:42] try to get him out of the way
[1:20:45] are you being discouraged
[1:20:49] God tries to see what you are going to
[1:20:52] do
[1:20:53] to try to discourage
[1:20:57] Elijah tried to discourage Elijah
[1:21:01] that's what brother Branham says
[1:21:05] to see what you're going to do
[1:21:10] because there's something coming
[1:21:15] let's see let's see if he gets out of
[1:21:17] here
[1:21:23] because the mistakes
[1:21:30] does those things
[1:21:33] see if you're gonna go back
[1:21:36] because he has something down the road
[1:21:41] he tried in a roundabout to try to leave
[1:21:44] Elijah behind
[1:21:47] Elijah said as the Lord
[1:21:50] and your soul never dies I'm not going
[1:21:52] to leave
[1:21:56] I like that is when a man has been born
[1:22:01] again of the spirit of God
[1:22:05] we've got to be born again
[1:22:08] you know a lot of the the big phrase
[1:22:11] today
[1:22:13] I was born this way
[1:22:16] you know the homosexuals I was born I'm
[1:22:18] born like this
[1:22:21] I'm born like that
[1:22:23] that's
[1:22:25] why you have to be born again
[1:22:29] I was born like this
[1:22:32] that's true because you were born in
[1:22:35] equity
[1:22:38] that's why you must be born again
[1:22:42] I like that when a man has been born
[1:22:45] again of the spirit of God
[1:22:49] and he sets his eyes towards heaven

[1:23:09] will use anything

[1:24:27] if you've really been born again
[1:24:31] mistakes will not let you get bothered
[1:24:33] by that is
[1:24:36] what the ram says
[1:24:39] and he got up there and said now you
[1:24:42] stay here
[1:24:45] the Lord is calling me to the school of
[1:24:47] prophets

[1:26:10] those who have placed Their Eyes On
[1:26:12] Jesus Christ
