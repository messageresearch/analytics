again I thought of Hermanos Amigos operations all of our Brethren and all those family and friends that loved our sister like to just Express a few words about our sister Elsa he is I had the privilege to know this matrimony it was possibly around the end of September of 1999 and at that time the means in which God allowed us to get to know each other or meet each other Ramirez was through their son Manuel Ramirez Jr and my son is they used to go to the same school Amigos and being that they were friends my son told me there's a little boy that wants us to go to his house and then afterwards well I'll see if I'll let you go so that happened yes and that's how we started to have a fellowship with our brother Manuel and our sister Elsa at that time my brother Manuel he used to work as a mechanic yes that made us have even more of a friendship our sister else I remember I remember visiting them in the first home that they had that they rented she made these really large tortillas and I already knew how those were made in Sonora tortillas these really large tortillas and that's how we started to have a relationship and honestly from that point is where I started to share the message then afterwards they accepted they got baptized then here's our brother Manuel present fighting the good fight we had many trips to various places California which was California Colorado Mexico New Mexico then right here even within the same state of Arizona California but now on a trip that we made to California I believe the area is called Watsonville is our brother Bernie had some special services there the issue is that when we were on our way back our brother Manuel's vehicle he was driving with his children I believe only manolito Jr was the only one that didn't go on that trip but coming back or the car on the passenger side the wheel or the part that holds on to the wheel is it was damaged a is and the trip was very difficult we were in the northern part of California and when my brother Manuel showed me the impact that the vehicle had I started to pray I told the Lord allow us to arrive with my nephew and stay there that right there we won't move until the vehicle is fixed our sister Elsa El peligro now she saw the scene or the the the risk she was so calm she was very peaceful and as we were looking for a place where we can fix the car and it happened that no matter how much we searched we couldn't find a single place where to fix the car in every way and when we're out on the freeway you're allowed to go 80 miles per hour and see how much it's bouncing and what happened is when I looked he'd go above 50 miles an hour and the tire would start to do like this Anton says and then we said that brother Leyva to make a prayer brother Manuel said he said well why don't you give us a powerful one because we just can't continue on like this [Music] our sister Elsa was a woman of much persistence because of our fellowship and I got to know them and how she was so we made a prayer and then we continue Hermanos Brothers dios God is dios is God and the same God of cancer that has healed cancer that has raised up the paralyzed it's the same God that our sister with all her heart yes it could go above 65 miles an hour in every way on the freeway and the tire was going so gently that we were able to arrive with our nephew without any problems the next day there was my nephew he had all the materials that we needed when my brother Manuel lifted up that tire to fix it there was nothing regards to something metal that was holding it together and we even went above 65 miles an hour our sister was very enthusiastic she's always so enthusiastic for example something for example like if I would say sister else would you like to take a trip to a certain place just say the word and let's go and that's how she was our sister Elsa is one thing that I admired of them every time we go out to trips or we perform uh trips with other brethrens but something that I admired about them never no matter how free the journey was they or the road was would they go ahead they'd always stay behind me and they were always following the car where I was driving I would admire that about them it's very outstanding for me and our sister Elsa hey yeah she is a Juarez she wanted to go to Juarez when I was on my way back over here they went over there to visit me and also to welcome me that I was on my way back now is and when they stayed at the place where we were at to greet her where there's no longer the need for a goodbye we're here in the time honestly we're creatures of time but over there that no longer exists but before ending I'd like to read a scripture they're in Saint John 11. thank you thank you so 1176 Saint John 11 25 reads this is Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this God bless you brother [Music] and all those that love her will see our sister again God bless you understand God bless every one of you this afternoon we like to give our sincere condolences uh La Familia Ramirez to the Ramirez family on behalf of the lighthouse Tabernacle is Montoya and my pastor our Dr Ernesto Montoya we come to express some words family they mean to us Los amamos we love you we appreciate you [Music] [Music] and the sister everyone that knows her everyone expresses something that they knew or remember about hermano the Sierra persistente and the brother was persistent she was very loving she was very uh kind very respectful Nosotros particular Persona and and for us and in particular myself uh Lara songs the reason why we had more contact with the family foreign and the sister just like our brother Ramirez they always gave us their unconditional support God bless you siempest they were always on top of helping us with anything that was needed at any time so that we can have whatever we needed to help that's not their son we had their son there with us and in seeing the manner in which he would compose himself and in that manner we could see the quality of a mother that they had it was the respect and dedication that he had we could see that that was something that didn't just appear out of nowhere but it was something that was taught of him by a mother that feared God a mother who was always expressing her love into her children conditional in an unconditional way and we'd always see that through one of their children she was always so loving and so helpful and then and then getting to know her I can understand why it is she was that way we've been taught [Music] the name of the person has a meaning and seeing the characteristics that seal the personality [Music] characteristics the expression of the characteristics of God through the sisters I can see the impact or the power of the meaning of the name the word Elsa many interpret it in one way or another but the meaning is God is abundance or the one protected by God or the one that is consecrated and that reflects what our sister always showed us while living that name was always used throughout the Middle Ages for princesses by Queens and by princesses it was a it was a name that was used by royalty chemical representation and what better representation that our sister has given it as a daughter of God always demonstrated what she had in her heart the power of the Holy Ghost the power of the Resurrection within Hermanos because like our brother read a scripture It also says that if we believe that Jesus died and resurrected so shall God bring with Jesus those that died and that's the comfort that we have that's the word that we give unto the friends our sister has not died she only sleeps she's just sleeping because the scripture that our brother Aurelio read tells us where the our Lord Jesus Christ is I am the resurrection and the life in me and he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and our sisters so therefore we've got hope no we don't have it we've got security not just the hope but within us the power of Resurrection that will lift her up in the ladder it's not something in the air it's a shirt a assurance and I give this as words to the family that that same Assurance she has that same power within her anyone can acquire that was the desire of her heart that the family would all so God bless the family God keep you uh may God give you the understanding the strength to be able to see beyond the curtain of time that she is in a better place she knows that the family is Left Behind but why algo but there's something and that's the holy ghost that connects us with that beautiful place and in having that Holy Spirit in our hearts it connects us with each loved one that has gone with the Lord so God bless you because God bless the Ramirez family to every one of them you have our support conditional unconditionally Familia every one of the members of the family every one of the members God keep you [Music] La Fuerza and may give you the strength to continue forwarding this time of tests and may you know that God's in control of all things and always remember the word is life in truth and Jesus says the resurrection and the life and he that has understanding our sister she's only sleeping she is she's gone with the Lord yeah she's in the Lord on that Latter day she shall resurrect God bless you I appreciate the trust of our brother Manuel and the Ramirez family brother Manuel the passing away our sister Elsa really caught us by surprise uh honestly I can understand the young men a little uh I'm about six years difference I lost my mind oh I lost my mom around six years old so then or six years ago forgive me so I can understand you uh I don't know how to lose a wife but I lost my I see my dad and I was there with him [Music] when you've got a pain a cut or a fracture in the body you go and you buy medication and medicine for the pain if you go to the pharmacy you get some pills for a headache and you take them [Music] and you if you have another issue you get some medication to counter-attack that uh but when a pain comes like this one there's no medicine in the world that can comfort that pain the only thing that can Comfort it is the Lord Jesus Christ what people do in the secular world uh they go and they they wrap themselves up in alcohol and drinking to calm down the pain and alleviate it or some use drugs to get away from reality but the problem only gets bigger it doesn't heal it what happens here is the only thing that can heal that pain according to the message the Lord Jesus Christ that will give you that Comfort the strength the faith the security that you can continue on you won't stay there because of Separation but it's a momentary separation and I want to tell the family the family members so those that don't know the Lord you see the body of our sister else foreign will how the water would flow foreign foreign foreign and she thought that she was dreaming it's okay at that point of death she wanted to just reach the light and as she was approaching the light she told her loved ones my children you know how much I love you know how much I love your father but forgive me at that place in that moment I couldn't even remember you all because I was going to a better place and she came back to life that our sister she's in a better place she's waiting to reunite once again with her husband with her children she want for everyone every single one that she knows to be there with her most sincere condolences we pray for the family but we know that the only medicine for this pain is the Lord Jesus Christ which helped me when my mother passed away was the prayer of the Saints Ramirez we're praying for you all God bless you [Music] thank you when I come to the river [Music] a day when the last winds of Sorrows [Music] to show me the way I alive who crossed Jordan Alone I won't have to cross [Music] ing [Music] every way for you [Music] for you [Music] one goes [Music] now [Music] it is [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] because [Music] [Applause] [Music] what my eyes with God [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] inside [Music] foreign [Music] that was the sign foreign not personally for myself but to give attention to the word of God this is the word that our sister Elsa loved to hear the word of God if you're so kind to open your scriptures to the Book of Job verse 14. as you're finding it is let us bow our hearts yes Lord heavenly father is this afternoon Lord we draw close to thy Throne is Lord there are many people that know and that knew and loved our sister Elsa Ramirez and Lord we're here honoring the body of our sisters Comfort unto his children his grandchildrens through your word Lord knowing that that's the only we put all these things in your holy hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen just a single verse Job 14 verse 14. foreign [Music] you look at the trees [Music] or died when there because death just takes us [Music] if you'll just watch the way that nature works you can find God in anywhere you look oh that is you'll see God if you get God in the heart so then when you've got God in yourself you look at nature you see God doesn't matter where you work you see God because you've got God in your heart now when they talk about reincarnation and stuff that's foolish people a reincarnation exists and what is reincarnation it's reincarnation is when a person they live again the winters that's the life of a Christian yes he is nature cries and gives us a message that he is but we see that the morning and the sun will rise Corinthians that's a question that maybe we have Muertos now so is also the resurrection of the dead it's sown in corruption it'll resurrect in in corruption is planted in Dishonored and Gloria resurrected in glory is the word of God okay will be raised up with incorruptions but we're resurrected now like it says in the scription Romans chapter Romans and it says if the spirit of him Jesus from the dwell in you Jesus he that raised up Christ Jesus from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal Body Spirit that dwelleth in you so when the Lord Jesus Christ he went to be crucified no one takes my life I surrendered resurrected on the third day and all those that believe in here or resurrect them on that day maybe many of us won't encounter that day but maybe one of us but the question for everyone is is have you accepted the Lord Jesus Christ that's the key is the Lord Jesus Christ nothing else noise nothing else just the Lord Jesus Christ there's many people okay no cry they don't believe okay that Jesus Christ First Corinthians chapter 15. now let's start with verse 12. foreign is our preaching in vain your faith is also says the Lord Jesus Christ that you're hearing this afternoon the faith you've got in the Lord Jesus Christ it's in vain let us keep reading and we are found false Witnesses of God because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ whom he raised if so be that the dead raised a person someone not someone that was told by Secondhand all right we're the most miserable people the scripture tells us foreign there's people with different religions so that their Prophet can get on that horse and they said the biggest part of the people wasn't looking for Jesus they wanted to talk to Lazarus now Lazarus he was a friend of our Lord Jesus he's the one that died he was dead for four days and the people didn't want to talk to Jesus they wanted to talk to Lazarus notice Brothers Jesus we say well if Jesus was here right now I want to talk to Jesus when people search for Lazarus now we're going to see why because race from the dead maybe they went with Lazarus that's at all lazarusa how did that work when you died you were there in the tube oh when the Lord what did you feel he speaks your name just in the word of God hey and from testigo he was a witness what happened tell me about it that you could raise from the dead that Jesus raised from the dead and I say in this building tonight this church this afternoon there's many you say personas at least a thousand people sitting here that's a witness that Jesus Christ raised from the dead in other words this witness is here there's people here seated they're Witnesses of the Lord Jesus Christ amen Brothers they wanted to see him see him God's wit s that Jesus Christ could raise from the dead and I'm a witness tonight A Witness is someone that was their presence that saw it firsthand now you can say brother the Lord Jesus Christ he's not here that's right let's keep reading and God is showing signs and wonders that he did raise up Jesus Christ from the dead amen how do I know he lives in my heart how do I know he shows signs and wonders before the people how do I know he's taken me from a life and given me the Life of Christ and I know that he rises I am a witness now we haven't met the Lord Jesus Christ in person but we Are Witnesses [Music] foreign it's just him foreign [Music] sister don't you want to see them it's possible there's something that does exist after this life but we've got to be ready when God calls us amen Brothers we're closing is we're going to close our eyes if you need something from God if you want to accept the Lord Jesus Christ don't be embarrassed you know your life isn't right with him why don't you lift your heart why don't you speak to God say God but Lord forgive me this afternoon I won't accept you this afternoon you might not understand all that this preacher preached I understand one thing is that you do existence they'll also exist [Music] [Music] [Music] the most thankful people Lord [Music] I place every one of them in your hands this afternoon I placed them in your hands you know all the hearts now father give Comfort to our brothers we're ready thank you for your Holy Spirit In The Name Of The Lord yeah man [Music] oh my goodness
