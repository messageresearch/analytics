[39:10] [Music]
[39:11] and let him go uh
[39:16] amen
[39:17] if you haven't been coming
[39:20] it's been a while that you haven't been
[39:22] to church
[39:26] or
[39:29] and this is the first time you're
[39:30] hearing the gospel yes
[39:34] maybe it's the first time you're hearing
[39:36] the word
[39:38] maybe this is the 100th time you've come
[39:40] to
[39:54] you're about to find out why
[39:56] we cry when we praise the lord
[40:02] you're about to find out why we raise up
[40:04] our hands when we come to church
[40:10] you're about to find out why we say amen
[40:12] to the words
[40:16] you want to find out why that sister
[40:18] that you used to know was a sinner esta
[40:20] punto enters
[40:50] why we're so crazy about the gospels
[40:56] in the beginning in the principle
[40:58] everything fell todo there was no hope
[41:01] for mankind
[41:04] we were going straight down the road
[41:05] that was going straight to hell
[41:10] no one was exempt from it
[41:12] doesn't matter who you are or who you
[41:14] come from
[41:16] it doesn't matter who your father was or
[41:18] who your grandfather was important
[41:22] it doesn't matter what you did no
[41:23] important
[41:25] you had one destination
[41:28] and that was to go straight to the pit
[41:30] of darkness yes
[41:34] all because of one word back in the
[41:36] garden of eden was messed up
[41:42] everything fell todo well the brand says
[41:44] now the roses had thorns
[42:00] uh
[42:14] or if you lost
[42:27] why we're so thankful with the
[42:38] that they know that the innocent
[42:40] substitute had to die for the guilty
[43:11] and then now they would offer a sheep a
[43:14] bullock or something and kill it
[43:21] throw the blood on the altar
[43:24] so
[43:38] there's not strength enough in animal's
[43:41] life
[43:44] to a tone for human life
[43:49] it's greater as human life than animal
[43:51] life
[44:34] so good
[44:40] it can never take those sacrifice could
[44:42] never take it
[44:43] take
[44:44] or make those people perfect
[45:06] how many times we try not to lie
[45:10] or how many times we try to do the right
[45:12] thing
[45:16] it was never good enough
[45:19] it doesn't matter what you do no
[45:21] important
[45:22] it's never good enough
[45:25] you might say well what's the point
[45:30] if you just follow me just a little bit
[45:32] we'll get to there bueno
[45:35] brother graham says decent amount of
[45:37] random now notice
[45:39] all the law having a shadow of things to
[45:42] come today
[45:51] paul was trying to say how they were
[45:53] circumcised the males by flesh pablo
[45:56] procuraba mentioned
[46:00] it was a type of circumcision by the
[46:02] heart
[46:05] of the holy spirit of this day
[46:08] how they kept the commandments back
[46:11] there como que ayanes entonces guardama
[46:39] we don't want the word of god just in
[46:41] the bible
[46:44] what we want in our heart
[46:46] god said it's in the bible it's in a
[46:48] table
[46:52] but in the future
[47:06] thou shall not steal
[47:21] you see if there's no law
[47:25] there's no sin no
[47:27] i was cutting this this police officer
[47:29] the other day
[47:32] he's a regular and he says louise do you
[47:33] know they're about to legalize marijuana
[47:35] in the states
[48:18] i told officer you know that back then
[48:20] adultery you can go to prison for
[48:22] adultery
[48:28] oh yeah that's right
[48:30] now you can adult her and nobody says
[48:32] anything
[48:45] oh there's no the crime rate has gone
[48:46] down
[48:48] frequencies
[48:51] because there's no law
[48:54] and i said now people murder
[48:56] aura
[48:58] because now it's with the law you just
[49:00] it's fine
[49:14] do
[49:15] you just wake up and you're wrong
[49:19] you didn't do anything and you're
[49:20] already wrong
[49:22] you're living and you're wrong
[49:24] doesn't matter what you do no important
[49:27] you're wrong
[49:28] there's no
[49:44] you can run a red light
[49:47] you can't do this why if you run a red
[49:49] light
[49:52] you haven't done wrong because there's
[49:54] no law to say so no assets
[50:09] and it wasn't sin because there was no
[50:11] law to say there was sin
[50:16] when law came on mas
[50:19] law was added until the perfection came
[50:24] a man has always tried to find something
[50:27] to save himself by all right
[50:32] he is still doing it the same thing
[50:34] today
[50:38] hasn't failed
[51:04] you start following me well brother
[51:05] what's the hope for us then
[51:19] trying to cover sin with his own merits
[51:23] whatever we do they're dirty rags to the
[51:26] lord
[51:29] whenever we come and we sin under the
[51:31] law
[51:34] we had to bring
[51:54] and it's still in my heart y'all next
[51:56] time because it's still in my mind i
[51:58] want to send me money do you want to do
[51:59] it tomorrow
[52:03] job was a perfect example of doing
[52:05] sacrifices for him and his family
[52:11] where is his kids were out there
[52:13] uh
[52:14] on weekends and so forth
[52:28] say he committed adultery or he stole or
[52:58] you look at the significance here
[53:01] last significance slam had to be
[53:03] blameless
[53:06] for a blame person
[53:11] says i hope you see it
[53:14] is he says when we when we're here stuck
[53:17] with the rules of the law
[53:23] there's no hope for mankind noah exists
[53:25] esperanza parallels
[53:39] god gave the ten commandments to moses
[53:46] god took that prophet and took him to
[53:48] mount sinai
[53:52] hey man i'm in you took them up there to
[53:54] mount
[54:09] perfect and not sent him to mount sinai
[54:13] he didn't send him to mount sinai
[54:16] to mount calvary
[54:19] calvary not to get the law no
[54:36] i told every single one of you stand
[54:37] right here in this line
[54:40] and if you tell me everything you've
[54:41] done wrong
[54:44] just by looking and standing and being
[54:46] alive
[54:49] you're wrong
[55:33] who
[55:40] oh brother just hold on what do you mean
[55:44] let's read the scripture
[55:46] matthew
[55:49] and behold there was a man
[55:51] which his hand has withered away
[55:54] and they asked him saying is it lawful
[55:57] to heal on the sabbath days
[56:28] and the the people started looking at
[56:30] him
[56:32] is he about to
[56:34] break the sabbath
[56:42] what man shall there be among you that
[56:44] shall have one sheep
[56:46] and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath
[56:48] day will he not
[56:50] not lay hold on it and lift it out el is
[57:04] how much then is a man better than a
[57:07] sheep
[57:11] wherefore it is lawful to do well on the
[57:14] sabbath days
[57:19] he said oh if you had a sheep stuck on a
[57:21] fence somewhere this is
[57:38] how much better is a man than an animal
[57:43] wherefore it is lawful to do well on the
[57:45] sabbath day
[57:49] so they saw that this man that was
[57:51] called a prophet
[58:06] he is
[58:19] and man breaks his covenant
[58:35] how many times have we done that
[58:38] sometimes don't even come to the altar
[58:42] sometimes we're in our car we're in a
[58:44] room
[58:48] i promise you lord i'm going to start
[58:50] serving you now
[58:53] if you take me out of this one
[58:56] lord you did something great i'm going
[58:58] to serve you with all my heart
[59:02] man never kept his covenant with god
[59:06] we're always the one who leaves god
[59:11] the law was never kept
[59:14] completed they couldn't keep the law it
[59:16] is not
[59:28] there was no hope for mankind
[59:44] when jesus was there on lazarus graves
[59:46] jesus
[59:49] and he called them out by his name
[59:54] and that's what the scripture in the
[59:55] 44th verse says and he that was dead
[59:58] come forth
[1:00:36] how many of you have a scofield bible
[1:00:38] like brother branham uh
[1:01:08] romans chapter eight and romano el
[1:01:10] capitolo ocho what did jesus christ mean
[1:01:12] by saying lose him and let him go
[1:01:18] romans eight and romano
[1:01:23] for the law of the spirit of life in
[1:01:25] christ jesus
[1:01:29] jesus had made me free me
[1:01:32] from the law of sin and death
[1:01:36] so when jesus christ told lazarus
[1:01:40] said lose him and let him go
[1:01:44] it was jesus christ himself
[1:01:48] liberating him from the law of death
[1:03:29] [Applause]
[1:05:20] just
[1:05:47] jesus christ sin and flesh
[1:05:59] now if you start noticing there's two
[1:06:00] laws that i just mentioned
[1:06:23] the greek word and deuteronomy means two
[1:06:25] different laws
[1:06:30] and that's just what god has yes
[1:06:34] two different laws those different
[1:06:37] one of them is the law of death
[1:06:40] and the other one is the law of life

[1:09:18] serving our country
[1:10:00] because i love him
[1:10:02] i'm not here because of an obligation

[1:11:16] understand that
[1:11:19] law is a system of rules

[1:11:57] different
[1:11:59] same thing in the spirit
[1:12:03] are you following me this morning
[1:12:05] the same applies to the spiritual elo
[1:12:09] spiritual god took you out from the law
[1:12:11] in death
[1:12:14] do this don't do this do this don't do
[1:12:16] this
[1:12:19] romans 6 14 romano says
[1:12:23] for shits for sin shall never shall not
[1:12:26] have dominion over you.
[1:12:31] for ye are not under the law
[1:12:34] esta is
[1:12:48] you don't deserve nothing
[1:12:52] but i was just born
[1:12:55] that's right yes yes just by being born
[1:12:59] to die
[1:13:15] doesn't matter what you do important
[1:13:20] yesterday
[1:13:23] you made a mistake this morning
[1:13:30] what then
[1:13:41] [Music]
[1:13:45] you just told me that i can do whatever
[1:13:46] i want and brother you just said
[1:13:50] you just said if i just sin this morning
[1:13:52] i'm under grace
[1:13:56] two different laws those
[1:14:38] because he took me out of that mess
[1:14:51] and you really repented of what you've
[1:14:53] done
[1:15:08] not because you're scared he's going to
[1:15:09] send you to hell
[1:15:12] or because he's going to condemn you
[1:15:15] you do it because you love him
[1:15:19] said even if he sent me to help
[1:15:36] because he loves me for killing me and
[1:15:38] he saved me when i didn't deserve it
[1:15:41] i don't want to do those things
[1:15:45] that's the true revelation
[1:15:48] that we don't just go in and do things
[1:15:49] because we're not under the laws
[1:16:05] god doesn't see what you do because of
[1:16:06] the sacrifice of jesus christ
[1:16:13] we love him for saving us
[1:16:16] and i wouldn't do anything to hurt him
[1:16:46] and i know he'll he'll still love me the
[1:16:48] same things
[1:16:54] in the world
[1:16:56] i love him so much to go back
[1:17:00] i wouldn't go
[1:17:13] stand fast therefore in the liberty
[1:17:15] with christ has made us free establish
[1:17:18] firms
[1:17:22] stand free be free
[1:17:24] that christ has made us free for christ
[1:17:45] you know what that is
[1:17:46] have you ever seen those out there in
[1:17:48] the ranches and farms or whatever where
[1:17:50] there's two bulls
[1:17:56] and there's this big woody thing right
[1:17:58] on top of them
[1:18:02] that's a yolk
[1:18:04] and that man that formers on the back
[1:18:05] and he's just pulling the ground on the
[1:18:08] ground
[1:18:57] i don't know whether i've told you or
[1:18:58] not it's just a little fiction story
[1:19:04] all right i hope you hope you're paying
[1:19:05] attention it's brilliant
[1:19:29] you know his ears were broken down his
[1:19:31] knees were knocked
[1:19:34] out
[1:20:02] what a horrible looking mess i am
[1:20:06] but if that mother could speak back to
[1:20:08] the little fellow
[1:20:12] you say wait a minute
[1:20:15] you can live
[1:20:31] back and get a lamb without a blemish on
[1:20:33] it
[1:20:37] and kill it
[1:20:38] so that crippled up looking milk and liv
[1:20:44] you see the priest never seen the mural
[1:20:50] it wasn't it wasn't whether the mule was
[1:20:53] perfect
[1:20:56] it had to be a perfect lamb
[1:21:03] it isn't whether you're good enough to
[1:21:05] be a christian or not
[1:21:10] it isn't whether you are good enough to
[1:21:12] be christian or not
[1:21:16] christian whether he is good enough
[1:21:22] god accepted him
[1:21:24] and his blood makes an atonement
[1:21:40] um
[1:21:50] [Music]
[1:21:53] then that little mule could stick up his
[1:21:55] towel up in the air
[1:21:59] and snort and jump and run around all
[1:22:02] over the field and have a good time
[1:22:08] he's going
