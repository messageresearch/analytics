heading back to home to Phoenix let us pray that they may have a safe trip back home brother uel brother brother Josh may the Lord be with them in all how many of you have the scripture we'll be reading from verse eight [Music] and the word of the Lord came onto him saying arise get the the sth which belongeth to zidon and dwell there behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain Thee I want you to notice the OD things that God does he didn't send his Prophet to a rich man he didn't send his Prophet to someone who has the means but he sent him to a widow woman it's like if I were to come from the city of Mexico he said get to sister's house amen come to the household of the sister we see that they're honest Widow women that they maintain themselves in the church they have a good testimony but why to a widow woman why doesn't he send him with someone who has a lot God knows what he's doing we give him the honor and the glory this morning 10 so he arose and went to zerath and when he came to the City Gate of the city behold the little one was there Gathering of sticks and he called to her and said fetch me I pray thee a little water and a vessel that I may drink another odd thing it hasn't rained for three years and a half the the water was scarce the people in the streets were were complaining the wells have been dried up the rivers have been dried up there was no water and notice what the God's Prophet is asking and it it says I pray the give me a little water in a vessel that I may [Music] drink and as she was going to f it he called her and said bring bring me I pray thee a morsel of bread in thy hand she didn't have anything else we're going to read that she only had a handful handful of of meal that's all that she had a handful of meal and a little bit of oil and she picked up these sticks I'm going to read that she only picked up two sticks what can you do with two sticks see if I can grab what can you do with two little sticks you can form a cross and that is what she was trusting in not a whole lot of firewood she didn't have enough strength to pick up this firewood but she want to pick up two sticks to prepare the handful of meal that she had and a little bit of oil that's left over me and my son or I going to go in a corner and going to wait to die but listen verse 11 and she was going to veget he called her and said bring me I pray thee a morsel of bread in thy [Music] [Music] hand verse 12 and she said as the Lord thy God liveth I have not cake but a handful of meal and a bear and a little oil in a course and behold I'm gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress for me and my son that we may eat and die let us pray Heavenly Father Here we are this morning maybe some of us Lord we have come to that condition if not in the natural Maybe Lord when we leave Lord May our fridge be filled that's three gallons of milk there might be a lot of eggs it is everything and it's filled maybe they're not lacking anything in their [Music] fridge they might have a pantry where they stored a lot of their cans that's in the natural Lord but there might be some of us that we might not have enough in our fridge in the natural Lord here we are this morning we come to the right place we have promised to come be with us and apply our needs perhaps in the natural we might have everything Lord but in the spiritual we've only have a handful of meal and a spoonful of oil we need a touch from thee Lord you help all of us this morning give you the honor and the glory in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen let me take your seats there's three messages that I want to recommend to you for not to mention four when we mention a message here when we're standing here brother I always carry with me a a notebook I always mention the name of the of the minister I I write down the title that he's I write down the scriptures and I put their scriptures because he's going to read more than once perhaps and halfway through my journal I put messages he's going to mention some messages and when the minister mentions the messages that he's going to read he's going to read them he has them there he already has them God gave it to him and God told him going to read this so we get up here we give you the messages because we can't get up here and read everything completely we don't have the time to read the whole full message but we give you the most outstanding portions hoping that God might give you that Revelation so whenever you get home when you go back to your house you may look for it you may look for it and search it I heard a young man from New Mexico his name is Tim and he preached the message as something like this and he preached a message uh the message brother Rand be certain of God I uh wrote it down I went back to my house I studied it and for a month I have not stopped reading it for studying it for one month I haven't uh I haven't I've been having been reading all day and every time I read I learn something from it so this morning my message and the message that I want to that I want to bring to you I brought it from that message be certain of God I put a handful of meal a handful of meal and a spoonful of oil and a spoonful of oil that Widow has came to the last just like us we we reach the bottom and we seem that there's no exit we seem seems like there's no intercession now I I tell you this morning and there's someone like this this morning that are they find themselves like this remember there is a God remember there is a [Music] God you see that he doesn't move or doesn't do anything is because he's working so the first message I want to recommend to you is be certain of God the second one is Elijah and the meal offering that message I I liked it I I enjoy it very much Phoenix Arona and he also preach it here in Phoenix Arizona the third message is spiritual food in its due season and when you read those three messages and when you've gone over them and you go over them again I recommend the fourth message straight is the gate and narrow is the way I have a month and a half listening to those same four messages and even though I I listen to more but I go back to these four messages you don't know how much you learn when you listen to to God's voice in these days and I believe it's it's a Time scripture says that God will send a famine upon the earth now we don't have hunger anymore thanks be to God in the natural we're no longer hungry there's days that we eat three meals a day and some might not have that because even though we might be in the United States but there's also hunger here in the states there are fridges that are completely filled and there's no more room to put food in there and the pantries are filled but I tell you but there's people that don't have to eat thanks be to God that we have something to eat in the natural but in the spiritual God said I I will send a famine upon the Earth it won't be for water it won't be for bread like I said and I repeat it again we have that in abundance but it should be a hunger to hear God's word it should be a hunger to hear God's word so remember God's word is more important than anything else blessed be the name of the Lord am amen so when we give a message and we give another message and you write it down and you go back home and you look for them and you and you rehear them again God gives something special blessed be the name of the Lord and we're very happy with God on Friday when we were here at church and we heard a brother Castillo sure's here while back home is brother Castillo here may God bless our brother Nick Castillo I really enjoyed his his sermon because in this message that I'm quoting of being certain of God and I had written down here to mention Jo for about 15 minutes because of how time goes really quickly but if you came here on Friday all you saw online certainly I woke up Ear early in the morning and I reheard his message all the message from Friday I reheard it again this morning and I Rejoice hearing of brother Castillo because indicates one thing that we're connected in the same channel because I come Friday and he preaches seasons of tension and he speaks of job and job had four admirable things and four job had four beautiful things but even so God still tried the faith of and and God tries all of us and God has all the right to try all of us J was a sincere man he was a man who was faithful to God we know that he was he was rich we know that his riches from morning to night I gone away I was talking to my wife and I was telling her how his wife how she also suffered now the Bible doesn't really show The Suffering of his wife it talks about job's suffering but we see that it was the children of both of them what they had was for both of them and everything was taken away they were left without nothing and her her husband job she he had something in his body that it was it was he couldn't handle it anymore there comes to a time when she comes to him he says why don't you curse God and just die in this message be certain of God brother Ram says she wasn't a foolish woman but she spoke as a foolish woman why don't you just curse God and just die and sometimes brother when we men go through infirmities or sicknesses this month and a half I've been going for some going through something very terrible i' never gone through a month and a half so terrible like I did this past month and a half and also myself have a lot of faith and trust towards God and always beg and ask the Lord I will I will make an inventory I ask God and say God I came from a certain place and I preached over there I drove five to six hours I'm thankful that you took me and you brought me back I prayed I begged and I've asked I go to church that's my life the church is my life that's all I have but but Lord if there's something that I need to confess to you tell me Lord when we bring everything to God and we're still uh going through something and we see that there's no light at the end of the tunnel remember God is still working God is trying your faith if he doesn't heal you today don't worry but make sure that all is well with God job knew that all was well with God when they accused him be to be a secret sinner he said I am not a sinner I've have offered sacrifices for my children in case if they were to sin he was an honest man he was a prudent man A Man Who Loved God but nothing the less it seemed like God did not listen to him remember when he seems like God is not listening to you and it seems like we're worse from yesterday it seem like there's no way out when it seems I'm going to tell you that God is still working with you this morning blessed be the name of the Lord job came to the recognition that he came without nothing and I'm going to leave with nothing and that's something that we must record in our mind we brought nothing into this world the Apostle St Paul said and we're not going to take anything we're not going to take out anything so everything we owe it to him he should be number one in our lives he should be number one in our lives when we put other things like number one we're worshiping an idol and remember here in the United States the people are worried a lot about their houses they were worry a lot about their jobs they worry a lot about their money and they worry a lot about their cars these natural things that we see nothing that we have are we going to take it give thanks to God for what you have and if you need something God will give it to you God will give it to you not when you want it but when God wants to give it to you blessed be the name of the Lord but when the brothers we go through a a tremendous time like that a cough in the night I'm talking about just a cough and my wife would turn to me and said just drink a little bit of water get a get a little cough drop in your for your throat a water and a cuff drop she didn't say what wife job said she didn't go sleep in another bedroom that's something that touches you something beautiful they're there she's there with you even though you're waking up every 15 minutes but there she is or there because she loves you because there's trust in God place all your confidence in God and God will help us God going to bless us blessed be the the name of the Lord we can spend a lot of time speaking about job but there's another thing that brother Brandon mentioned in that same message I'd like to for you to open up your Bibles to the Book of Daniel and I believe it's the third chapter I want to spend about about 10 minutes there this is in the story where King Nebuchadnezzar makes an image we see that he sent forth a decree an order that everyone should worship him but in his kingdom there were three young men subra M and abnal here the men have preached a lot about that I'm just repeating of what they once said so Nebuchadnezzar raised up a great big image and the people all the people worship the people bowed down to it but there were three young men that refused to to bow down to it let's go to Daniel 3 let's go to the 15th verse we're gonna read the last portion or last sentence said if you're willing are you're ready for the sound of the Cornet the music and the last sentence of 15 and who is the god that shall deliver you out of my hands and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands that is what that King told that those three young men and who is that God that should deliver you out of my hands let me tell you this morning that there is a God the mighty conqueror he is the one to deliver us all the time he's always watching us all the time he knows your heart he knows your thoughts he knows who you are he knows when you're sick he knows everything about you and remember he loves us but he if he loves us if he has so much trust towards us he will allow he has to allow but on the contrary nothing will happen he has to allow it for a small infirmity to come go without a week without work [Music] that your car in the morning doesn't want to turn on go through a trial that you know that you should not be going through that trial but you're going through it it came to you let me tell you this morning it's God trying your faith let that faith not get dismayed for his name be the glory and what is that God that should deliver you out of my hands this he says verse S drach massak and answered and said to the king oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter it is not necessary for us to answer you in this matter look Our God who we serve is able to Deliver Us from the burning and he will deliver us out of thy hand O King notice what they're saying what kind of faith and he will deliver us out of thine hand he said he might Deliver Us said no he said he will Deliver Us PR his name be the glory they had Faith they knew who they were trusting in now my answer question is do we also have faith do we know who we we're believing in I know who I'm believing in I know where my my faith is resting even though I went through a month and a half that was terrible but I know who I'm trusting in and coughing and being sick I say the Lord Lord you know what you're doing but Lord just give me patience let not my faith be dismayed on you you know when he's going to give you the way out for his name be the glory when there's an entrance there's also an exit and he knows when to give us that exit those three young men those three young men said it's not necessary for us to answer you about this man the god that we serve he will deliver us out of that far but he if he does not do so we will still not Bow Down and Worship and the message brother R says be certain of God he says because they knew that if God were was not to deliver him out of the fiery furnace and they had to walk to the fiery furnace and die God was going to raise them up in the first resurrection God was going to raise them up in the first resurrection they had that trust so we're not going to bow down to it we're not going to worship it blessed be the name of the Lord what trust another messages the prophet says he was observing the scene and the angel comes and says Lord allow me I'll go and I'll go and I'll change the scene and I believe he was able to do [Music] that I believe that angel going have come and eras Babylon with everything that it had to bring down a flood and get rid of everything but that a loving being that's up there and is observing you and it's only proving your faith when you stand up for him remember he will stand up for you that's the SC says who shall confess me in public from in front of the men I will raise them up oh speak of him to my father blessed be the name of the Lord but he was observing them he says no said they trust in me says this is my job and he brought forth a chariot and he came down himself blessed be the name of the Lord he came down himself Went to went to come and comfort those three young men not one hair of them was burnt because when God does it he does it right he he shows everybody that he is the God blessed be the name of the Lord going back to our message Ahab was the king he he was one of the most wickedest kings that Israel ever had his father was like him and truly Ahab went and got married with a woman named Jezebel brother said there was no doubt that Jezebel was a beautiful woman but Ahab had no reason to go get married with her a Christian should marry another Christian and I say Amen to that amen I believe that a Christian should marry another Christian but there are no youth how is there no youth who said that there's no youth if I say a youth to stand up all of them will stand up if I tell the young sisters that stand up they will stand up what we need to do is for God to open up your eyes that's what happened to the servant of Elijah he says elishah says Lord we're surrounded he saw with his own eyes he saw with his own eyes and they saw that they were surrounded and the master the prophet said says Lord open up the eyes of my servant so you can see and so when God opened up the eyes of his servant he saw that the mountains were filled with angels for his name be the glory amen so just take that advice and God will help you and bless you must have been a terrible morning it's hot and dry Phoenix we live in Phoenix when we have temperatures of 118 I'm not sure we've gotten to 120 this summer we have and outside it's miserable you can't be outside for much time so we know already have an idea of what the heat is must have been a terrible morning dry and hot amen there hadn't had no rain for three years and a half and six months it was so dry and hot to the world was ready to blaze into fire the people were starving in the streets and there was cry everywhere and all this had been through all this had been brought because of the moral decay of the nation Israel was loved of God but when they got out of the will of God the enemy had had taken him over when one gets out of the will of God notice what I'm saying when someone gets out of the will of God who is the one that will take control the enemy there's only two it's only God and Satan so when we get out of the will of God when we leave God when we forget about everything so who's going to start controlling us may God help us this morning blessed be the name of the lord it's something like today they're all in agreement that they did that because the government and the queen endorsed it because the most the the government and the king and the queen endorsed it and they were the most popular people in that Nation let me bring something a little bit more close brother R says we had a Catholic President and without doubt we're going to have another one I'm not going to say but you know who I'm talking about Kenedy we have a president by the name of John F Kennedy he was a president declared a full [Music] Catholic and the his wife was named is Jacqueline and let me tell you what they did they took out the prayers out of the church out of out of the schools so when when the teachers gathered together ready ready to start learning they would take out a Bible and read something out of it and then a prayer was made they commended themselves to God all of that was taken out of the schools by a man and a woman say we had a Catholic President and without doubt we're going to have another one let me bring it in today's day the president that we have today in the White House and don't hit me when we leave but he is a a full Catholic President what brother ramam said is the truth that's why I believe it and that's why I shout it out when someone gets out of the will of God there's someone else that comes and take takes control of your life if you have to come back to God this morning Run come back it's like a place was to be burning and you're there inside the building get out of there take your kids with you cuz that fire take away your life and I tell all of you this morning if we have to run to God this morning run to God you might be running to the bottom of the barrel this morning there might be just a handful of meal just for one one little bit of meal left and a little bit of oil to cook it but remember brothers and sisters there's two sticks there's two sticks that that wiow want to go pick up and brother R said that is the cross and remember who was the one who died upon that cross there was only two sticks that they were required and that is what she picked up but let me tell you this a little bit over half an hour let me tell you this before God plans what he's going to do God prepares all things and I'm going to repeat what brother Castillo said on Friday and me I was screaming and shouting where I was at he forgot his Bible he almost left the whole the complete town [Applause] when he usually leaves to a certain training usually he doesn't carry a suit and a tie because he knows he's coming forth our training it's like us when we leave the church they brothers that go out and they go change and I always just go like that there I am eating and and the tie is there on the Chile he says watch your tie I just go like that but there's brothers that have take the time to go home and they change that's fine may God help us but let us not take off our eyes on what we truly believe PR his name be the glory but he said but I went back home to get my Bible and that was all before brother Eli asked me if I could preach on Friday that's why I tell you this morning before God can do something God prepares the things but Cas he perhaps didn't know the brother was going to ask him to preach on Friday but he packed the suit and TI he went back for his Bible and on Friday he came here and preached a beautiful message may God bless our brother for his name be the the glory that just shows me that God prepares everything before bringing out his plan for his name be the glory when God spoke to Elijah and said he said go go tell Ahab it will not rain for three years uh and six months until you until you say it notice notice what God is telling him until you until the prophet until he says it again until he says it again he says you quickly go to the Jordan go to the Jordan I have a creek there that's flowing with water and go there go hide there go go and be there and I have given orders notice and I have given given orders to to some Ravens I know who spoke about Jonah how that little small will began began to grow because God Was preparing something for it it was a special well it was not just any well but it was a special well and God has prepared it inside of its belly that Jonah the prophet would be inside of it because Jonah was going to be the representation of our Lord Jesus Christ because Jesus said that's like Jonah the prophet was in the belly of the well for three nights three days and three nights so the son of man shall be in the womb of the Earth for three days and three nights so God began to prepare that little small fish so God began to prepare these crows and I've ordered these crows Ravens to go and feed you it was just not any any food it was bread and it was meat how many you like meat I'll tell you one thing I was raised in a very humble home and I wasn't asked to be raised in a humble home but he put me in that humble home I like a lot of those Kos there is a soft drink that's called because my father would come home at 8:00 at night we were five in the family and he was the six I was orphan as as a young man we were six and he bring six Kos with him and he would bring six loaf of bread that was our dinner and I have I'm not shamed having shame to say I was born in a humble home I know what poverty is I know what poverty is I know what I didn't have that's why I help when God gives me something extra I share it because I know what God has brought me out of I am I am happy I'm thankful with the Lord nothing in this world it matters to me he is the one that matters to me blessed be the name of the Lord I praise him this morning amen I come out this similar way this morning talking about the story of brother Nick Castillo God was providing everything and God Was preparing him so on Friday he could be here preaching to us what if didn't bring his Bible what what if he didn't have his suit and tie with him you understand what I'm saying God prepares everything before he does what he's going what he's planning to do God had that Creek filled with water and there's what Elijah went and those crows brought bread and meat in the morning and meat and bread in in the evening time it got to a time where the creek dried up and God said rise up he already had everything prepared go to zerath and sidon and I've given orders I've given orders now God didn't come down to that Widow but God was putting everything in its place there was only a handful of flour a handful of of oil that his boy her boy ra raised up that morning that little boy that she was Raising because she was left as a widow and I like the testimony of brother George Smith I wasn't here I was completely I but I was I was watching online and many have asked me why have not I remarried again that was testimony of George Smith here he say because she's waiting for me over there that's beautiful that's beautiful because she's waiting for me over there there's widows that are here with us this morning go and ask them why have they remarried they got all the right to get married their husband passed away because she wants to have a reencounter with them may God bless our Widow women he is our all he is he is your all so God prepares everything am amen goding everything brother says God give us more Elijah in these evil days on this corruption that we're living in so they so they're not scared to preach what's the truth what the Bible says without Holiness no one shall see God you shall cleanse yourself from your sin by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ you should cleanse you from your sins by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ so his name be the glory and there was a woman there in the city none of the two both of them didn't knew each other the Widow didn't know Elijah and Elijah didn't know the Widow but she must have been an honorable woman she must have been the same type or caliber as that man God chose that woman amongst all that woman in Israel to attend his Prophet when say when Jesus was here on Earth he said there was a lot of widows in the time of Elijah but none of them went to Elijah but only that Widow there are zerath and sidon why because he had everything prepared his name be the glory amen amen he went there to the barrel sh had a handful of flour she goes to the barrel of oil to see how much oil she had left and then she only had a little bit of oil left that's all that she had left between her and death I suppose she was praying all night blessed be the name of the Lord I suppose she was praying all night she had nothing left blessed be the name of our Lord so the creek dries up over there and Was preparing something over here he gives him the instructions go to zerath and Sid there is a widow I have given orders to feed you blessed be the name of the Lord am amen so here comes Elijah he's walking here he's walking he gets to a certain point and he's starting to see what God has show him over there where she was she saw a woman was thin with her clothing worn out picking up two sticks Elijah saw her and gave thanks to God this is the place where you have sent me so he says he says or he tells that I pray that you may bring me a vessel of water drink and says the the woman discern the man and notice that he was a good man he says yes I will share the little bit of water it seem like he's a good man so when she left a little bit of water that she had left she heard the prophet said and I also beseech they bring me a bit of but bring to me first and said to me first when you put God first God Honors that when you put your work first when you put your car first when you put your bank account first when you can put everything you can mention first before God that is an idol may God help us this morning not to be worshippers of Idols but to be his worshippers because he's looking for worshippers for his name be the glory I beseech the bring me a cake in your hand it's as long as the Lord live that I had a handful of meal and a bit of oil and I was going to go cook it for me and my son and we're going to go sit down and wait to die they have gotten to the bottom God is waiting for us to get to the very last I don't know who has gotten to the very bottom this morning but there's someone who's got into the bottom there's nothing left but there's still a cross there's still a cross and there he is and his blood is still flowing for Mercy for you and I blessed be the name of the Lord amen if the musicians can come forth forgive me that I didn't give them the thanks but you know that my memory doesn't help me sometimes I don't even know my own phone sometimes I have to ask my wife what's brother VI's name he say give him this is the brother with a smile that one I can't remember I come I see the pastor and I told him on Friday I said the Lord bless our pastor I can't remember his name and my wife said well just get it in your head I can't remember it's our pastor brother thank you Lord you already know me thank you sisters I enjoy the music I enjoy it when you play and I'm going to say this in closing I don't know who has gotten to the bottom I don't know who has been asked I have a scripture I haven't read it but it's found in Luke the Lord Jesus it's telling Peter he's telling Peter and he could tell it to you this morning his name be the glory whatever your name is Satan have desired to have you and shift you as wheat isn't that what happened with job that's what happened with job Jesus was warning and telling him behold Satan has desired to have you to shift you as wheat I don't know who hair has been shift as as wheat I was shift for about a month and a half and I'm barely coming out of it but I give thanks to God because that's when we love him the most that's when we love him the most because he's continually working because he's working by your side watching you he's taking care of you his name be the [Music] glory I don't know who has come to that point this morning
