tonight you can have him tonight and he's here to stay forever it's all on you the decision is yours the service is ready the songs were songs we prayed unto the Lord we're here to hear the words but are you ready to receive and take that word we have a youth service here tonight so we're going to try and direct ourselves to the youth this evening that maybe something might be said or something might be read that could touch a young person tonight maybe open up just a little bit of those eyes the little eyes of understanding so they can take another step forward and reach that goal is I'm glad to see a brother and the members of zulima Gracia tonight I was with them not too long ago and it's so awesome for them to return the favor and be back here with us again [Applause] thank you I want to thank our pastor for the opportunity and just greet each and every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you keep me in prayer for my nerves to come and we don't come to hear the man we come just to hear from God so as we're standing if you'd be so kind to turn to the book of Acts chapter 19. foreign and I couldn't find a good title for tonight so I said why not keep it simple for the use we're going to title tonight a genuine experience so Acts 19 2 reads the same Acts 19 2 said he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and they said unto him we have not so much has heard whether there be any holy ghosts and he said unto them unto what then were you baptized and they said unto John's baptisms then said Paul John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on on Christ Jesus Christ and when they heard this when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and then Paul laid his hands upon them and the Holy Ghost Came Upon them and they spoke in tongues and prophesied yeah there's Bower has for prayer Lord Heavenly Father we thank you this evening for another blessed opportunity to be in your house Lord what a pleasant blessing to be able to have our visiting Brothers come tonight to bring their lick of fire into this building to bring that Holy Ghost anointing that they carry with them in this building that we can create an atmosphere of Revival here tonight maybe we could have another Pentecost here tonight but father for all of that we need one thing we need of your holy presence here father we ask that you would come this evening make yourself present and evident Lord so that a young person tonight can be touched and transformed you saw this service before the foundation of the world and you know each and every young person that would be here tonight so father just let your word flow and open the hearts this evening help me and my interpreter Lord then we can just surrender ourselves to you we put ourselves in this service in your hands bless the reading of this word we give you the honor and glory and the thanks in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen thank you to the musicians the title genuine experience I believe our entire Christian walk is based upon a single genuine experience every step forward that we take started with a genuine experience that that experience that caused repentance that experience that took us to the Waters of baptism is that experience they gave us the baptism of the Holy Ghost the experience that gave us the new birth experience and you know I really enjoy using this scripture from the book of Acts 19. and specific for the Youth uh because when you read it it seems like the people that Paul was talking to had an excuse because they were able to say we don't know of a holy ghosts and talking to the youth tonight yeah every message believe in youth tonight cannot have that excuse because I know we preach about a holy ghost I've been in service with our brothers and they preach about a holy ghosts unless this is somebody's first time here in a message Church you know about the Holy ghosts but for this specific group of people these were already genuine Christians who are believers that Paul happened to encounter they had a revelation they were following the words they were living the word for their days because they went and they had their messenger John Juan and they were baptized unto the baptism of John foreign the word says the word the Bible says that they were baptized then in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now I find it amazing that in those scriptures there was no record of an argument there was no debate here going on you know many times we run into people that we try to to evangelize muchas many times not even trying to present to them an end-time message and they're so impregnated and rooted with their own doctrines and beliefs yes it immediately comes with the resistance attention but these believers that's why it's so easy to believe if we're Believers today foreign just like these that accepted the baptism of Jesus Christ they would be Believers in this day so as soon as they heard they were all re-baptized and the Bible says that then Paul laid his hands upon him and then they received the Holy ghosts they received it after baptism first was the baptismal and then was the Holy Ghost and we know God has a process that he's mapped out that they are in time messenger has taught us of a process to reach that new birth I want to read a quote I don't know if the brothers got the quotes or not Manos on the message birth pains in paragraph 49 reads and and so it is in the spiritual realm is it yes yes it's water it's agua justification by faith crucification Believing on God receiving him as your personal Savior and being baptized he puts those all together in one for the first step water justification by faith believing on God receiving him as your personal savior crucification and be baptized second is sanctification sanctification of the spirit that God cleanses that spirit and he cleanses it from all the elements of the world all the elements of the world and the desires of the world nobody can tell me that they haven't had desires of the world we're born in this flesh young people every young person in here has an attraction to the world if your Nature has not been changed in all actuality you being in church you forcing yourself to pray you're forcing yourself to see forcing yourself to act decent if your Nature has not been changed we're actually fighting against the true nature that you have right now so why not not fight that nature is that something that you want tonight and the desires of the world brother Branham says and then the Holy Spirit comes in and it gives you the new birth and it fills up that Sanctified vessel the words of our prophets and I wanted to share two testimonies two examples from the Bible of a baptism I don't know maybe you've read about maybe you've read this testimony maybe you haven't but about the eunuch in the Bible I believe he's the Ethiopian who was out on his Carriage Olivia was on his way to Jerusalem and he was reading the book of Isaiah and simple enough he was just on his way trying to maybe Enlighten himself because something's about to happen and then Philip crosses path with this unit eunuch he notices that he was reading the book of Isaiah I forget what exactly he was reading but he couldn't understand and so he uh Philip asks him do you know what you're reading you know like maybe uh maybe our youth leader or some of the brothers that helped in the youth might ask the youth do you understand when you're reading the Bible when you're reading the message and in the honesty of his heart he's just saying I don't get it is he talking about himself is he talking about someone to come here that was the hook or the Real to Reel him in like our brother Emmanuel used to say a lot Manuel to study a word study a word study a word foreign this is not an option for me I have to do this now there's one example but we have another example we have Paul and Silas Silas and then the Jailer in prisoner I believe Paul and Silas were in Rome I could be mistaken but they were causing up a stirrup in the city and they were they were taken captive I believe they were beaten down they were thrown into that prison and and you know maybe this took place in the middle of the day when the sun was still out let's say around 11 12 o'clock in the afternoon and you know there was a Jailer that was appointed with the commission to watch over there yeah if he was not paying attention he might have missed the opportunity that was right in front of him but he was told to watch so that they would not escape and so as we know the scriptures if you've read it around midnight there was a great earthquake that happened and and the doors ripped open and the chains fell off something Supernatural just took place now I was telling my brother Emmanuel in the back Sometimes the best way that I can understand things is to try and get into the scene that's why I said let's say that Paul and Silas got put in prison during the afternoon and the Jailer had to watch over them all day till midnight what must have the Jailer heard from Paul and Silas in that prison Paul over here preaching to this group of of prisoners Silas over here praying for this group of sick uh uh prisoners Deliverance taking place baptisms of the Holy Ghost maybe taking place taking place left and right and here is the Jailer walking up and down the aisles listening and seeing these things the scriptures say faith in hearing the word of God [Music] foreign but this man was watching and therefore he was listening foreign he's going to get fired he's going to get put in prison they're going to kill him the Bible says that he wanted to kill himself stab himself in the corner said no stop foreign it took me back to our are we went once to South Africa with my sister my wife esposa we're at a Convention of about three or four thousand people yes and this testimony maybe reminded me of a certain person yes it told us how the bus drivers would drop people off at the entrance and I think you'll remember I believe you'll remember this and that the bus drivers would just come here drop off the two three four hundred people they sleep in their bus they get out and go eat the free food from the Fellowship Hall Salinas since there was no air conditioning they would just open the doors to the to the auditorium is drivers would just come in and kind of hang out and listen to the service for a little bit it is by the second or the third service the little bit that they caught of the word of God being priests in less than 24 hours those bus drivers surrendered their life to the Lord Jesus Christ so the Bible says that this Jailer is told what can you do to be safe very simple Bible says just believe the Lord you and your household shall be saved and the Bible says that he and his household were baptized two very different experiences but both of them were genuine experiences you can look at the eunuch and say it was so simple so basically I don't think Philip had to yell at him and try and make him cry and break down he just had to Simply take him through the scriptures but in the Jailer on the other hand that Gentile unto the Jews and non-believers who was there probably even hated the Jews that he had there in the prison he required of a tremendous Supernatural experience natural we're both still needed to be evangelized both still needed to be convicted and both also have to repent yeah repent and then be baptized and you shall receive the gifts the young people you shall receive the gifts of the Holy Ghost so both were going through those steps repentance and if the story could go on at one point in their life the baptism of the Holy Ghost is youth we should know those steps by now repent be baptized receive the receive the gift of the Holy ghosts justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost crucification sanctifications and thank God for our profit to make it even clearer very simple water blood and spirits and the message the third seal so the brother Brandon could say to young people tonight he says justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the last three messages the last three Church ages forms the complete birth just like when a woman is having or going to have a baby [Music] the actual first thing that happens is water so young people do we understand that it makes sense I I wanted to share a testimony of something personally that happened in my life it was in the first years of me being you know it's funny the only time the first and only time I ever shared this testimony uh from behind the pulpit is a few years ago my brother Emmanuel foreign you know the first time I ever shared my testimony which is a dual testimony mine in my wife's testimony yes I don't know who caught wind of it but it just spread like wildfires so for many years I wasn't preaching I was just testifying of what God had done in my life and it took me to testify in many countries all the way to South Africa that trip that I was just talking about so for you to get a picture of how many times times I kept testifying and testifying and testifying the more I would Testify the more the devil would attack me every single time because back then I didn't have the same knowledge of the scriptures I have today I didn't have the same knowledge of the message like I have today now that I remember I believe that was the when I gave that Testament the first time I met brother Lewis in Persona and look how God is I'm able to share the battlefield with my brother Louise God is well I will share my testimony and I couldn't say clearly without a doubt I know that I went through the steps of the new she was justified Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost right there on the spot and because of my lack of understanding I like the expression I know that I know that I know because sometimes if I don't understand it this much I'm still going to believe it I didn't understand how why it happened but I know it was real and you know I would share her testimony in my testimony and and I didn't want to tell her yeah that I had doubts that she didn't go through the steps of the new birth maybe she wasn't born again maybe these testimonies we've been sharing have been fake they've been people baptized there have been people that have been blessed but if we're lying then all this is fake and the devil would attack me over and over and over I want to tell her because I didn't want to discourage hero did I know she was thinking the same thing about herself but she didn't want to tell me because she didn't want to [Music] and then he starts explaining what they're foreign was getting so many letters and questions that he couldn't open them up and read them no more there wasn't enough time in the day so he was testifying that Billy Paul would give him a letter he was just under the anointing and the gift that God gave him he would just write the answer and send it back write the answer on top and send it back it wouldn't even open it you don't and here we have a letter from a sister who asked brother Branham the question is you have to be baptized in order to receive the holy ghosts brother Branham writes on the top and we saw it God bless you Sister you do not have to be baptized to receive the baptism of the Holy ghosts we broke down crying so bad she didn't know that I felt that way I didn't know that she felt that way we turned around and looked at each other because she was in front of me and at that moment when knew that we had the same struggle but we knew that we received the same answer and the very next day my brother that gave the tour invited us to his house and when we were having a good time sharing testimonies and fellowships his I believe his mother or his grandmother who was healed who was healed by Brother Branham of cancer who brother Branham called her by her full name when no one in her family knew her full name the sister was a little bit deaf she couldn't hear so she was trying to be discreet asking her daughter-in-law she wanted to say ask him about the okay brother would you share your testimony all right as we're sharing our testimonies there's a certain part that caught the attention of the brother that gave us the tour is and it was like a revelation had struck him at that instance and he got up from his seat he said I get it I get it I understand now yesterday when we were in the voice of God building and I was telling everyone I want you to know we have have hundreds of boxes in the back filled with hundreds of letters inside of them and of all the letters we could have put it we chose to put that one because God wanted to preserve this letter over 60 years because the prophet his ministry is still working today we've seen it how many times since our brother Emmanuel told us his testimony the brother said it preserved that letter for 60 years so you can have your doubts answered foreign I believe that the reason Paul had to be baptized there because it's officially an essential in the Bible that we are baptized official official what does he say official and essential official a indispensable that every single one of these young people here gets baptized now he says but I'm going to take it right back to them when the thief was hanging there on the cross and he died without being baptized at all absolutely he was not baptized but he just said that we have to be baptized foreign status but he said that was the first time he had the opportunity I don't think this is your first time for the opportunity we can find ourselves in the regions of the lost if we die tomorrow or we can accept him tonight and meet him in Paradise but what are you going to do about it okay are you going to accept him are you going to make that decision if we jump into the story of Cornelius and Cornelius was a Roman Centurion Cornelius I think the Bible says a good man that would pray and do give things to the poor multiple times kind of like bothering him it was it was a burden upon his life and eventually told him that he needed to go send someone to find this man Peter okay and to bring that Peter to the house there was something Peter had for him and now God works on both ends of the line a deep calling if that's the Eternal Light Of God then it's a perfect line of God and he's going to prepare things so perfectly for you in your life foreign the Holy Ghost was for the Gentiles I'm gonna tell you one thing young people I won't be shocked tonight if somebody gets the Holy Ghost tonight if some Gentile here tonight there's something tonight she's like those Jews that were surprised because I know that this word and this message was sent for us for us in this day they received the Holy Ghost first they received the Holy Ghost and then Peter says you see you see can you see now they've received the Holy Ghost so then can anyone object to them being baptized they've received the Holy Ghost just like we've received the Holy Name is the orders and every last one of them were baptized so this was a little bit different this was not baptism than holy ghosts these ones receive the Holy Ghost and then that drove them to the Waters of baptismales no but Brandon says in the message where is he King of the Jews the birth means we have been changed from our thinking from our attitudes Changed by the something that took place on the inside it took the blood of God's son Jesus Christ you don't need to join no churches no merits of your own I'm going to say this for the young people and you'll read it up there quit trying just receive it he's the one that's going to lead you to the life so quit trying for yourself just receive it tonight he'll take you to that new bird you know Young Brother young sister have you been born again I applaud you I I congratulate you I'm happy for you you know because one day I don't know whatever age you find yourself in right now but you're going to be wanting to search for a husband or a wife it's it's we could say it's inevitable a young brother young sister if you haven't been born again do your spouse a favor you know I wanted to say do yourself the favor but do your future spouse a favor you get the Holy Ghost for yourself first make sure you first are born again because you you have no idea the burden that you're going to be on your husband or your wife if you don't first have the Holy Ghost and you know it is going to sound a little mean but you know but young man if you're really going to seduce one of these young sisters and maybe even a young sister that does have the new birth you run the risk of potentially ruining her life if you're not on that Highway to Heaven yourself then you're going on the highway to hell and who do you think you're going to drag along with you and young ladies if you don't have the Holy Ghost you haven't been born again and used to do just let him do it in your life let him change you let him transform you tonight so the young Brothers you can lead a Godly woman you know don't expect her to follow you if she can't even follow Christ expect him to lead you a noise if he can't even be led by Christ he gets right to the point you're not converted till you get the holy ghosts you know the Miracles the walking on water they're giving the keys to the kingdoms he wasn't converted until that Upper Room experience you must be young people tonight if you're asking well then how will I know when will I know I can't discern Hearts corazones I can't look into the future of the past of your life I'll give you a simple quote you take it how you want it well could you this was from questions and answers uh 0 8 23. well could you imagine a mother giving birth to a baby and not know it is neither can you receive the Holy Ghost without knowing it there's something that takes place in you there's something that changes the whole system your whole spiritual system is made new again you become a new creature in Christ and you know know brother Branham also says that there will be thousands that will be baptized in Jesus name and I hate to believe it of one of our youth here tonight and I pray it's not one of our youth here tonight but you know you just go in a dry Center and you come out a wet ones the title was a genuine experience you know you can fake a baptism here because it's an outward expression it's something that you're showing everyone publicly is I've known so many people that have faked that in their life but what you can't face is the repentance that took place in your heart because you ain't fooling nobody but yourself this might fool somebody but the repentance in you is only fooling yourself in the message expectations it'll only come through the experience of the new birth experience a man cannot go to the kingdom of God without being born again without being born again says no more than a bird could fly without his wings what was it that you told me in the back brother uh you said you found a quote that said brother Branham said one can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost over and over and over and still go to hell and still be lost and forgive me and still be lost so we must be born again in the message questions and answers once again number one preached in uh zero one zero three and then upstairs but you say brother Bill did you ever baptize anybody over is who had been baptized when they was a little fellow and then be re-baptized many times says if you want to be baptized if that's something that's standing in your way and you feel like you should be used you should go do it that's right you go do it you said don't let nothing stand in your way you make yourself perfectly clear so it gives the example just like if you had taken something years ago and you feel like you should go and make it right no matter what it is you keep everything clearly because you'll come up to that thing and you can't go any farther till you get that out of the way you say no you've just got to lay aside every way and everything that easily besets and if you want to be baptized again that's the thing to do I've baptized and if you want to be baptized and but if you want to be baptized and you was baptized when he was 13. or whatever age it was you would be baptized if it's in your way now you don't have to be baptized to receive the holy ghosts we gave you examples from the Bible De La Biblia living examples today you can receive the Holy Ghost tonight if you were to receive the holy ghost that same Holy Ghost would Propel you is it would push you it would take you unto the Waters of baptism because there is still an opportunity Brother Bruno says like back in acts 2. when Peter gave the formula repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you need to repent you need to have an experience of repentance first what he says yes God turned around and gave the Gentiles the baptism of the Holy ghosts he can give any one of us the baptism of the Holy ghosts he says you see it he said it's the condition of your heart is the condition of your heart tonight I can't tell you what it is but you know what that condition is you know if you've been living right you know if you've been living halfway life it's your heart and your condition is I spoke to a young sister and I asked for her permission to talk about her tonight you know we have a young sister here that blew me away about a month ago she shared her testimony for the Youth as soon of what God had just done in her life and you know if you were to know this young sister when you see her you can tell she's a good girl you can tell that she listens to her mother and her father you can tell that she dresses modest she's very respectful you know everything about her speaks about herself but who would have that she was at the end of the road that she didn't want nothing else to do with this this message with this Bible with this word of God that she was at the end of the road that she found herself one night very bothered molesta and her mother saw her all bothered is I noticed something's going on in you know and she started to confess her life to her mother and pour out the lifestyle that she was living lots of intentions of her heart that we're black is that we're full of sins she said Mom I don't want to go to church I don't want to have nothing to do with this no more that reminds me of Billy Paula de Billy Paul Mr Papa I I don't want to do this I'm done with this life and brother Brandon let him go yeah but this mother of this young lady had asked her she could pray for her and upon that prayer something happened in that young lady you know it doesn't always have to be a brother it doesn't always have to be a minister it was the love of a mother foreign [Music] [Music] I need to get baptized I don't know how it's going to happen I don't know when where but I need to get baptized now that very next service we have the whole thing planned out God wiped it away said no we're gonna do it my way foreign and what's amazing that's why I read this quote she had been baptized before but she knew that that was not a genuine baptism anybody tonight if you haven't been baptized the invitation is open anybody if you haven't received the Holy ghosts you haven't been baptized yet the prophet said it himself need to be baptized to receive the Holy Spirit whatever position you are in tonight you have something that you need from God you bow your hands and close your eyes brother Branham says in the message the mark of the beast what a message he came in second now you're either one of these today there is no middle ground either you're the mark of the beast the world the apostate church or you're the Seal of God holy and acceptable there is no lukewarm DBS there's nothing in the middle are you born again does your life cope with his words does your actions does your life does your dressing does your behavior does your spirit and does your faith does it all cope with the word of God young people ask yourselves that tonight it's for you this service was for you so do something about it Lord Heavenly Father Celestial oh Lord God we thank you Lord Jesus for just speaking to us tonight Lord helping us understand the baptism starts with an experience repentance starts with an experience the new birth starts with an experience and Lord you have the perfect order set out for every one of your children whatever you want of your son and daughter tonight Lord may your perfect will be done in their lives if they need something from you the altar is open for them if they need you in their lives if they want to make a public display that they accept you as their lord and savior the waters are open tonight because we have the most important thing here in the building tonight and it's moving in our midst and that is the holy spirit of God father we thank you tonight and have your perfect will in these youths in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen [Music] uh [Applause] [Music]
