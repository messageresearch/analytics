of jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high hey demi paris it's really nice are you happy to be in the house of the lord amen it's really good to be in the house of the lord yes you know god is very wise you know we sometimes we we think we one-up him sometime but you know why we have friday services why god wanted us to have friday services you don't come to the house of the lord on a friday night you know we're prisoners of the lord you know you know we don't do we want what we want to do you know we do what he tells us to do it's a reflection of who is your um what do you call that your jailer uh the lord jesus christ he tells me what to say he tells me what to do even though i don't like it but he he's he's my jailer but he's not just my my jailer is my car but he's my savior is miss salvador amen amen let's go to matthew 12 43. we're going to place a title to our message this evening what should i do after getting baptized about this army i get baptized what do i do brother what would i do sister you know the bible says repent and receive the holy ghost but what do i do you know we believe that god sent a prophet and that prophet is a prophet you know they didn't just preach the word but this prophet whether you like it or not he taught us how to control or how to manage our finances the prophet william branham taught us how to manage our money ciel prophet william brando como administration i thought he came to open up the seals and everything else and all this stuff yes but he taught us even how to manage your finances he taught us how a young man a young lady should court the common even taught the young man how to approach the young ladies i don't believe in that brother no hermanos she likes me she likes me he taught us how to approach a young lady go to the message through dry places so he can rest and findeth none and repose what do we find here what we find we find an individual a scripture we find you yourself put yourself there and this is when the uncle and spirit is not cast out of the man uh we know rebuked you know you know not that represent you know once because no one teaches the little child this little one this is this is how you lie oh yeah me mijo asi when your mom asks this you tell her the opposite once the little child is there you put some some music on and we're saying oh how cute and how adorable that little baby is oh look how cute it is but it's the unclean spirit the baby is not able to understand us to tell the baby look move you know jiggle yourself it's the spirit that's inside of him that makes a move and as we grow up you know we start doing wrong things so here we find with the christian right here for verse 43 it is that spirit that made you dance it made you smoke it made you lie your spirit another christian that has his battery load uh a christian around here at jericho tabernacles i'll return to my house he claims it that's my house when luis aguilar was born he couldn't find a christian and jericho tabernacle with his battery loan no pudo in control he said and when i came out he he find it when he comes in he finds it empty and garnish you know sometimes we start cleaning up our act we started stopping the things that we used to do more wicked than himself malignant you know maybe this little spirit that just made you just dance just made you lie every once in a while [Music] but he's going to find seven other fellows and the last state of the man is worse than the first post we find a young man a young lady a christian christian step to the lord chaos repented he got baptized and now now they they feel this fire that's burning inside their heart all right you seen this no no one's going to stop me i i feel good and the spirit is looking around trying to find another home you see we didn't cast out the spirits once the spirit noticed that you weren't obeying him the spirit kept telling you do this and do that and do the other el espirito yes you didn't obey you nobody says the spirit said with this guy listening to me anymore i'm going to leave it i'm going to find someone that's going to obey me don't make me feel at home and since you didn't do what the prophet said what the scripture said he comes back inside of you el buelve and if you're not if you're not uh ready you're gonna start doing things that you'd even do back then now you start doing other things in pieces now you start doing that in business and doing the other yes because the scripture has to be fulfilled brother what do you mean the scripture has to be fulfilled and bring other friends with him and you're going to start doing things that you didn't do back then a very beautiful picture jesus said when the unclean spirit has gone out of a man [Music] did you notice he never said when he's cast out of a man but when he goes out by his own will and the unclean spirit has gone out of a man and returns back to this man and finds that his house was that he lived was has been swept then he goes and gets seven other devils [Music] now but you see he just found it swept and garnished says don't stop for nothing don't just stop and listen to the devil always stay busy maintain yourself doing something for the lord another and then you find yourself oh what am i doing uh you already you are already just you already welcomed him back in illoga they see the hour approaching they know something is fixing to happen what do they do there's a lot of people not just christians but people who are not christians something something's going to happen brother and sister what does he mean what do they think what what were they thinking they thought that jesus was with him jesus and they went on in their way they went how long did they terry what three days what does it matter if you're not with jesus see he says your life shows whether he's occupied here or not the scripture told us in saying in the city of jerusalem receive the gift of the holy ghost notice what jesus told told him to do jesus he says go and tarry in the city of jerusalem now terry doesn't mean to pray occupy doing something for the lord we shouldn't just stay idle you know that this i'm comfortable with just where i'm at right now as brother brown and then come back and tell me if you still feel the same way you feel that burning inside your heart you've got to maintain yourself busy at all times now matthew 26 36 30 says then cometh jesus with him onto a place called gethsemane here we find the lord jesus christ before the crucifixion before he he got turned in crucifixion he he wanted to pray and he wanted to tell god you know what can you can you can you find another solution is because even though he was the son of god or he was god he still felt it in his flesh [Music] sweating he took with him peter and two of the sons of zebedee began to be powerful and very heavy and he began to be very very sad and he got you know the sorrowful just got really heavy on him and watch amen are you following me once again and he says and he went a little further he went a little further i hope you're seeing it the way i'm seeing it and he fell on his face if you can do something here that's something that we should always pray that way lord not what i want and your nose look you [Music] for the moon and the sun to change places but lord can you do it it's not what i want but it's what you want i remember just a little just a little in in parentheses uh in parentheses i remember sister sharon guzman shared his testimony with us he said that they broke into a couple years ago they broke into her house about a and it's the same thing with the lord jesus christ and he says we were stolen we were stolen property of the lord jesus christ he didn't have to pay for us he didn't have to come back and pay for us he paid the price he still had to pay a price the same thing with the lord jesus christ and he came in he hadn't he didn't have to pay for anything hello he created us but still he paid the price amen 84 verse 4 onto his disciples sometimes we find our our christian uh walk like that just sleeping christian imagine the master the lord jesus christ the rabbi coming on to these disciples imagine you couldn't watch with me one hour so what does he say kevin says what does he say what what what's what's the remedy for that question remember watch and pray watch him pray bella brother brian says this this is now yeah you'll find it i didn't want to put it up there because when we pray we're supposed to pray with our eyes closed both eyes closed and there's a reason for that yeah but i don't want the little kids to run out you know what brother louise said that brother branham said pray with one eye when i closed and one eye opens [Music] that's what brother branham said watch and pray when i who's crying and what's going on you know nope you man are you do you love the lord okay that's good now notice this was before the crucifixion but then peter you know a very you know notable character in the bible now let's go to saint luke 22 31. you know saying luke 22 31 this is right before around the same time about the when he got turned in uh he said the lord said simon simon behold satan had the desire to have you that he may sift you as wheat the holy ghost wasn't given out yet but you know there's peter you know thinking he man i i i can do all things and then the master turns right next to him and he says simon simon the satan has a desire to sift you as wheat. the prophet tells us the devil or the spirit's can't move or do anything without permission everything everything that moves because god permitted it and he says satan went up to went up to him he said let me have peter pedro i i want to shake him up a little bit and jesus didn't say it i want to get these these people who just recently got baptized i want to get sister violet you know you know god god is good you know you know and i believe that one you might criticize me for this but you know that you know the devil el diablo he's a real good adversary but i like i like how we say it in spanish you know we in english we call it the dolly uh in english you kind of carry you you want to carry the puppet you put it right on the dolly instrument eli come over here and then let's carry this no this dolly this this diablo so so i can carry the weight of support i don't i don't break my back and i hope the lord reopens your eyes we can't do anything amen i'm in now notice just follow me and my schofield bible and my concordance is here when it says wheat it says here it says peter was the wheat pedro er altrigo the self-confidence is the shock so so here's the devil diabetes he starts shaking up peter empiesa but he's not shaking up peter but i know sakura peppers get him out of the road jesus jesus christ i'm praying for you i'm praying for you that your faith will not fail but no faith you don't get dismayed but i can know this there it is i'm i'm praying for you he wasn't converted yet when you're converted straighten your brethren confirmation help your brethren in the face establish and he said unto him lord notice peter there he is right after right after getting baptized with the fire of the holy ghost i'm ready to go with thee of prison where i can feel good around him this [Music] you don't feel disgusting you don't feel like you've betrayed him i want to get to a place where i can feel good around him see i'm justified he says now i come to the stage here where i can talk to him because i'm still ashamed of myself of myself he's talking about the stage of justification i can have peace [Music] but i'm still ashamed of myself but i want i want him to cleanse me all of those things so i can really walk up to him talk to him when you're at peace with someone nothing against that individual that's how i want to walk up to him i want to walk home i want to walk up to him that way but there's nothing there hindering me that i did in the past something i right here the stage of sanctification now what did it do okay song what does the state of section but you know brother bernie says there's a lot of people who said i'm 80 years old i'm old i already got gray hairs yes can't change me i am who i am and that's it when i get here i'm the holy spirit by baptism brother says is that right this is just like how we get baptized in the water the whole body has to be on the water man's arm is sticking out of the grave like this what does the holy spirit i said jesus when he was commissioned his disciples to be missionaries jesus christ if you listen to brother branham's tapes always get get these words confused seminaries seminars cemeteries it says something he says not these cemeteries that's oh i mean seminaries that's right i see us he says not some cemetery or seminary no algonce that's some school of ethics [Music] behold i send the promise of the father upon you carry he in the city of jerusalem until you're in due with the power from on high ha after this this the holy ghost is upon you and you shall be missionaries witnesses or testigons onto me in jerusalem and the outermost parts of the world hasta la ultimo de la tierra brother branham says decent amount of branches it says the the place the country that needs more missionaries not africa no east africa that's not south america america it's the united this is how many believes are with all your heart now now you sinners and people seeking the holy ghost here's what the holy ghost is friends amigos you you that seeking it you don't have to seek and beg and tarry us you excuse me you don't have to seek and beg and terry use yes see but brother branham says this is right with you above is peter spoke these words there's no more waiting after that just with a willing heart ghost because without the holy ghost you can't survive without the holy ghost the holy ghost will make you stop your life the holy you don't have to impersonate it anymore tina's kept being killed you don't have to act like it anymore tina's getting there the holy ghost that's
