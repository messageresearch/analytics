our Lord Jesus Christ such a good time to be here in this Easter morning this day it represents so much for us today yesterday that's why we're a Christian today that's why that's why I serve my Lord Jesus Christ because he did not only die on the cross many men have suffered for the people many people have been Martyrs what's the cause but there was only one man that Rose the third day and that is our Lord Jesus Christ that's why I'm a Christian today because we're serving a living God not only that but he gave us the same resurrection power today he gave us the same promise that we will be raised from our sins we will be raised one of these days and our body our flesh will be tooken off and we'll step into our glorious bodies what a beautiful day we're living in today for a Christian Easter is every day we're a Christian the resurrection is every day I'm so glad for that amen amen I want to go straight to the scriptures I don't want to take your time if you'd like to turn with me to [Music] and I would like to continue my my thought on pressed in between and my subtitle is is the daybreaker it's such a um beautiful thing to have service right at Daybreak amen this is when Jesus started to walk out of that tomb is right before Daybreak there was Jesus's resurrected body and when the women went out to go go and and go and to minister to the tune by the morning he was gone by the morning life took place in his body amen that's what we're waiting on today amen amen it says for to meet to live is Christ and to die is gain Philippians 1 21 but if I live in the flesh this is the fruit of my labor yet what I shall chew uh what should I why shall choose I want not marciel Vivir is for I am in a straight betwixtube having a desire to depart and to be with Christ for it which is far better yes nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you all right we're going to go ahead and stop right there let us bow our heads Heavenly Father celestial what a special day that we're living in today Lord to know that we are walking in the fruits of your resurrection that each and every Christian today has that Earnest of their Resurrection they have your Holy Spirit father God lord we're not looking for for a day in the future father God lord we're not looking for events father Lord because the resurrection is not an event you said I am the resurrection in life father Resurrection is here this morning Christian every bride this morning is holding that Earnest Resurrection Lord we believe it with all of our hearts father we thank you for everything you've done we ask Lord that you just take control of this place this morning Lord we submit ourselves to you we asked Lord that you forgive us of all of our sins and all of our iniquities all of our transgressions Lord that you may come and Abode with us give us a little piece of Eternity this morning we ask all these things in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen and amen amen amen amen you may be seated so my subtitle this morning is daybreaker I would like to read another scripture in Isaiah Isaiah 60 is verses one and two verses and I got this scripture actually from listening to the message Shalom from Brother Branham the Bible says arise Shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee responses amen amen the glory of God has risen upon thee La Gloria de dios but then in verse 2 it says for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall rise upon thee and His glory shall be upon theeakyones Gloria brother Branham he read the scripture and uh he he preached the message Shalom two times the word shaloms mean peace and brother Branham preached this message and when he preached it he read the scripture and he said that there was a mix between light and darkness in this world now when brother Branham he preached these messages the first message he preached was I believe uh Sierra Sierra Vista okay here down south in in Arizona and he didn't preach it in a big church he didn't preach it with hundreds of people brother Bradham he actually said there was about 30 to 40 people in that little cottage he called it a house or he called it a cottage and he said this is my New Year's message that I'm gonna preach for 1964. and I'm gonna go preach it over there in Phoenix he said but at first I want to preach it to you he said because I feel more freedom to say more things to this little people [Music] so he he had more freedom to express more of the word to these people and then he said because when he goes down to Phoenix it was a convention there was Methodist there was apostolics there was Pentecost there was many groups many names is and he said there's a mystery of people there's unbelief and belief at the same time in that place so he couldn't truly Express himself the way he wanted to know because there was the denominations he was preaching to foreign that that these two messages one was directly for the Bride of Jesus Christ and then the other one he was directing it to a mixture of people and and his message was Shalom peace there is light Shalom pass I lose brother Branham he says in the message Shalom he says my New Year's message is to the church elected in Jesus Christ now now this one was preached at um in the the 12th day of January this is in Sierra Vista Sierra Vista and he says this my New Year's message is to the church elected in Christ in Jesus Christ for 1964 not just to the church groups Iglesias but the elect lady or the the elect the lady of the church Christ's bride de la Iglesia Novia de Cristo see that's who I'm addressing see brother Brandon wasn't talking to the denominations he was talking directly to the bride we're facing here in our two subjects that we read the two scriptures rather a very contrast in Isaiah it says it is arise and shine for the glory of God has come upon you respondes the light is here and then the very next verse he says gross darkness is upon this people and then we are we are in a mystery of light and darkness then my address to the church is Shalom peace let's find out what's what's it all about we're facing this year with both both darkness and lightest We Are The World is one of the most chaotic times of Darkness that it's ever stood and yet it's standing in again the Most Blessed light that it's ever shined in yeah brother Branham said there was a mixed mixed Darkness but light and darkness they can't abide in the same place in Genesis 1 2 in Genesis it said that the Earth was full of darkness and it was void and it was without forms but then the spirit of God began to hover around the waters and the first thing God said out of his spoken word he said let there be light and brother or the Bible says that light came out and it was good and then the Bible says that he divided the light from the darkness there was a time where light and darkness there was a mystery but then he says I'm gonna divide the light from the darkness and what life does whenever the day breaks so so Daybreak means it means whenever the first beams of light begin to shoot out from the sky significance it's been the darkest it's ever been in in the 24 hours that we live in and right when it gets so dark a beam of light begins to shoot out and it's a day break yes and that's what the light begins to do when it separates from the darkness it presses that Darkness where the darkness gets darker and darker and darker is and it pushes it out feel the the sun uh rules the whole day that's that's the day that we're living in brother Brandon we're living in the day of where we're pressed in between light and darkness we are in the most glorious day that we've ever been where the full manifestation of the word has come to the bride manifestation it didn't come to the denominations anymore it didn't come to those that want to organize no he goes to those uh few people and he Reveals His full unadulterated word to those people his word is the light brother Branham said when in his spoken word came out he said let there be light and when the light came forth that was the manifestation of the word manifestation that's that's what we're in today you know so when I started listening to the message Shalom my first time listening to it I said praise God he's talking about the Rapture because he kept talking about the Daybreak the day break but then he began to say that the light is the manifested word whenever God said let there be light when the light came forth cuando saliola that was the manifested word whenever the light showed up and that's where we're living in today in the day of the manifested word in the day where the full word is revealed only to the bride complete when it comes down to the denomination yeah they'll get Jesus Christ on the cross yeah they'll go back to the tomb where he rose up and they'll order those things back then but they don't know that the resurrected Christ is here today they say oh well well I have his Spirit he said oh crap but his full manifestation is his word manifestation completely it's his unadulterated word that has been given to us today that is our light today and the more light and the more Daybreak that we see the more the pressing of the darkness there is people say why why is it so dark in this world why is it so evil why are all these things happening in the streets why why is people leaving the faith all these things happening why is it happening it's because light is pressing towards it is because the coming of the sun is getting closer and closer and closer and darkness cannot live in life the Bible says that the devil only has a short time so he's seeking those that he can devour why because he's only got a little time of darkness and as that light comes forth more and more that Darkness gets pressed and brother as Bride As Christians of of the Bible and of uh the message we're in between the pressings we're in between life and death brother Brandon says in the junction of time [Music] now notice again that not only that that when hell is turned loose all of Heaven is turned loose when the enemy comes in like a flood amigo uh the spirit of God raises up a standard against it and these two forces is always showed up at that Junction so there's that changing of time and once that changing happens Heaven and Hell the enemy and God are there that's where we're living in is we're even in our bodies we're living in that where there's light and darkness in our own flesh where um Paul says whenever I want to do something good my body says every time I try to do something good evil is present with me Jesus was praying to God one time he said these people are not of the world these children are not of the world but he says please Lord don't take them out of the world let them be the light of the world you're not of the world Saints you guys are not of this place we can't get attached to this place my inspiration of this message came with our precious brother our brother Daniel and then I started thinking of all the others passing all those that I've seen that were were solid in Jesus Christ I saw their body dwindling away there was an anchor to Heaven they were anchored what they were anchored was in Christ Jesus Christ they were in they were in pressed in between life and death is there was a changing of bodies there was a changing of Dimensions the bride is going into the same transition we can't be attached to our riches we can be attached to those things we can be attached to our church names we can't be attached to I'm I'm a message believer um all those names and all those things that are are of the world are part of the darkness and that Darkness has to be pressed out but if there's a seed a predestinated seed inside of you that light that's always been in you once that light hits the ground it has to be life that comes forth we cannot be attached to these worldly things but when that change happens we're ready for that change we're ready for that body change we're ready to see our loved ones once more why because we're attached to Christ amen amen so uh brother Branham says in the message how can I overcome he says lady osia Church age is the grandest of all Church ages because it's the ending of time and the blending of Eternity and then it's the greatest sinful age it's it's more sinful than this eight um this age than they're ever that there ever has been and the powers of Satan is many times harder to fight against than it was in any age here back in the early ages a Christian could for his profession be being um of being a church Iglesia of belonging to Christo could be beheaded for it he could be killed and put out of his misery and go to meet God quickly but now the enemy has come in the name of the church and it's so deceiving this is the great age of deception so this age the devil's not trying to take your life anymore that's easy we see our brothers and our sisters go on with the Lord and they step the onto the other side with courage brother that's easy from stepping from One Life to another but the devil because the time has changed it's a blending of Time and Eternity that the devil he will come into the very churches that profess Jesus Christ and try to not not take your life but they're trying to take the light from the church what is the light the manifested word of this day the unadulterated brother if you really truly understood what church is sometimes me as a human says we can we can get into our routines and say oh okay I got to do do my duty for the church I gotta help out and it's all for the honor and the glory of God but if we truly understood when we sit here and listen to the words the word is feeding you vitamins every day see brother my flesh my flesh is crying out for dust every day the brother God said he said dust you are and dust you shall return so my body is crying out for the dust brother sometimes I get so tired and it's barely the middle of the day and I think to myself I'm so like a brother brother uh Michael knew that I was going to take a nap right now I'm very disappointed and my wife says it's because you're you're probably uh deficient on iron or potassium or something like that it's it's some kind of vitamin that I'm deficient so what I do is I take those vitamins to get more energy and potassium magnesium iron where do they belong where do I get them from the very dirt that I came from my body is crying out for dirt it's crying out for the very dust that I came out of it when a woman is pregnant oh man sisters you guys begin to eat fries and and ice cream you throw ketchup on anything what is it your body your body begins to thirst for the vitamins we've heard many times um uh women eating clay I'm eating clay why because the minerals are in that clay brother Brandon talks about the young man that was eating bicycle petals why he needed sulfur in his body brother Branham actually said his body projected him to the sulfurt and that poor little kid didn't know what he was doing but he was gnawing on that pedal he is what was it or does cry now to the dust it's a deep calling to a deep queso but Brothers in the beginning you were in God's mind you were a piece of God do you believe that there was a piece of you brother Bradham says we're made of 16 elements I I looked it up we're actually made up of six elements and then the rest it's it's we're needed we need it but we're made up of six elements and those six elements were crying out for every single day yes we're crying out for calcium we're crying now for oxygen for carbon all those things were crying out for those things but if you are the Bride of Jesus Christ we have a seventh element in here we have another element that is crying out not for the dust it was an element that was before the foundation of the world it's a predestinated seed in each and every one of you and the only thing that can satisfy is not church that's not our church duties yeah but it's hearing the word of the Lord because as much as I go and I eat a steak dinner I'm eating my my iron I'm eating all those things and it helps me is brother when I come to church I'm waiting to eat on a steak dinner and to get those Eternal elements so that it can feed the Christ in me I'm forming a Christ inside me today and the more I eat the more I become that Christ the more I strengthen myself communism that's what church is to me today every time I sit down I feed on the words knowing that it's fearing an eternal being inside a being that you've never seen before you see this little white boy but this is how I identify myself you've never seen me one day of your life it's me inside here and I don't feed on the things of the world I don't feel on those worldly things because it's Darkness there's a seed inside of each and every person there is thirsting for light so that it could be pushed out and be manifested it's thirsting for the true unadulterated words that's what's going to change us that's what's going to help us and we're pressed in between that light and the Darkness brother said that the the seeds were already planted on the earth when all the darkness was there it was seeds and brothers sisters that was you yeah you were planted somewhere in a denomination maybe you were planted maybe in the message but it when that word that manifested light comes to your body comes to your soul it can't help but to bring forth life if there's no light then then you've gotta get all all it is going to do is gonna manifest that there's nothing there amen amen we've been in this seven Church ages we've been living in in the darkness we've been living in the night brother Branham one one time he he revealed that every Church age was was signified by a moon phase and he said that the moon represented the church and the reflection that it had the light that it had meant Christ in their days the word in their day so every single Church age had a portion of light or a portion of word in their days in in Shalom he says he says isn't it strange that just before the pope took his journey into Jerusalem the moon in the heavens made a total blackout now this was in 1964. when when uh it was never recorded never recorded that a pope goes and visits uh Israel Israel it was actually in January 4th 1964. he goes and he he goes to to the Orthodox Jews so that they can create a fellowship and brother Abraham says not long after that they will come to the Protestants and do the same thing and brother Berlin said right before that which was December 30th 1963. there was a total blackout of the Moon brother said that there was light in every Church he said did you ever see the paper where they took the pictures of the Moon he says I have it here if it ain't a perfect image leaving out the seventh Church age which is not yet why did he say that he said it's not finished yet so whenever he wrote The Drew the light on the seven churches it was still continuing so there was light at one time but once the pope he went and he created fellowship with with Israel establishes he said the moon had a total blackout he said exactly the way I drawed the Holy Spirit the church ages they're the six of them the seventh is not finished yet the six conditions of the Moon how in its brightness in the first church age the dark in the second third fourth fifth and sixth just the way the holy spirit let me draw them on the board then identified himself uh on the wall of the Tabernacles two years ago the moon reflects itself and science again picks up the picture of the church ages just as they picked up the light yonderos and put it in life magazines in the opening of the seals revealing of the uh in the age of the seventh angel revelando what was it he said he said that was a picture he said that was a picture of the seven churches that there was a total blackout there was a total blackout whenever that happened showing the churches completely denied Christ there was no more light for the seven churches think about it there's no more light in the churches we were not waiting for for the churches to get bigger and better we're waiting for Christ to come back we're waiting for the True Light the true light to come brother Brandon says in Shalom is Shalom he said which was that was the church the moon represents the Church La Luna represented and before the before the church the shadow of the world crosses the moon and the shadow of worldlyism the the shadow of worldliness worldly church has swept across to black out the entire light of the Bible the word World got in the light of the reflection do you understand the world crosses the light of the Moon and blinded out the sun and the reflection of the Moon that's supposed to be giving light to the Earth it was blacked out foreign says that the bride is she will be a lady of SIA not by no means a lukewarm but she'll be on fire for God she'll be in the spirit of God that's where the bride is not in the lady you'll see a church age anymore she's received Paul says yes I want to go depart to be with Christ but I'd rather stay here and be in Christ and whenever you see me you see Christo brother we're looking for Jesus out there he's waiting for him out there but remember he's not an event he says I am the resurrection he is here today the resurrection and life is here today Shalom the light has come brother Bradham said good morning you don't have to be living in the darkness it's pushing out the darkness we're living in the new days we're living in the break of that new day yes we're waiting for the change of our bodies but it's the word that changes it it's the word every time we feed on that word that body is formed inside amen amen Shalom he says gross Darkness I'm going to continue to be reading these messages this uh quotes of Shalom well Contin but I truly encourage each and every one of you to listen to both of those messages it says gross Darkness blinding of Israel was for the lighting of Gentiles so there's always that Junction there's always that Darkness and Light coming now the blinding of the Gentiles is the lighting of Israel Israel so so whenever he says it's like day and night so when one side has got Darkness the other side has got light and then the light comes over on the other side so the moon passing the way it did and the reflection of the darkness of the world blinding out its light is a reflection to us that the Gentile Church age is finished the Gentile Church age is finished the church is making herself ready making herself ready for a time it's time for the Rapture for darkness is fading upon the Gentiles and Don will soon break upon the Jews but then he says he says the church the reason I say shalom to them is because that is God's peace brother there's a lot of things happening a lot of unsure things we see Banks they're becoming bankrupts we see earthquakes we see rumors of war in in Russia and China we see all these things happening we see people falling away from the Wayside but Shalom peace don't worry good morning the manifested word has come don't worry about those things the darkness will fade out it'll pass away but good morning that's what I want to bring to you this morning for this New Year's not looking back but we're looking for forward to the breaking of a new day until there is something great laying ahead of us where the years has been the joy that we've been looking forward to the pressing the coming of the great light and now we can see a breaking over the horizontal horizontal Realms it's breaking between Mortal and immortality we see a breaking between heavens and earth from an earth-bound sickness and a troubled world [Music] into a bright and Shining day of Immortal Life that shall never pass away it's shalom unto the church now it's like time coming for the Believers but grows Darkness for the people brother Branham said how could there be dark in life he said it's got to be separated there has to be a separation and the only thing that separates it is the word manifested that's what separates life from Darkness you've got issues in your body you've got you've got things that you can't let go of it the word manifested will separate the life hey he's doing it today he's doing it in the world he's pressing the darkness out is amen let's see um he says and the only thing that separates is the word manifested separates it presses it to the other side here's the darkness on the Earth but when the manifested word of God which is spoken into existence by the word when it shows itself Darkness runs on the other side so what is life it's the Vindicated spoken word of God brother Branham you can't light the Earth with flashlights it takes the word that's manifested the sun many many years they said Emmanuel's coming here comes God With Us so here comes here comes the the Son of God but when Jesus came in his day they rejected him why because there was no light in them there was no seed there was no germanized seed to to take a hold of that life so it darkened the Pharisees it's the light that presses the darkness remember that the more the light comes the darker it becomes pressing that darkness and it will be darkest before they finally breaks tonight now in closing now we've heard the story of of the Samaritan woman many times how how she was an ill-famed woman she was person a and Jesus he was walking with his disciples they were journeying around and in the Scripture it says I need to go to Samira um he said I need to go there he didn't go for any other reason just for that woman and when he went there he sat there in the well she went over there and she started to draw her water out and he said get me some water he said and when she saw him all she saw was a Jew all she saw was race I'm a Samaritan you're a Jewish we don't have no dealings with you guys he said and he began to reveal the word more and more and more to her and and then she realized so she said oh you're you're a prophet oh it is whenever the word is being revealed more what happens is is you see Christ more okay first first you just might see a message you might see a white man with no hair americanos that sounds like a hillbilly but when you continue to hear that word you say ah he's a prophet he said wow look at what he's doing but if you continue to listen to that voice and go beyond that man and and then finally Jesus says unto her and um verse 21 of of chapter 4. he says Jesus said unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet in Jerusalem worship the father Jerusalem now here comes the word manifested here's this woman that her whole body is defiled the Bible says she's no good no yeah but here's the word manifesto he went to the Pharisees he went to the priest they denied him but then here comes the word manifested to this woman and he says the hour cometh when you don't have to Worship in Jerusalem or the mountain or wherever he says ye worship ye know what not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews now she didn't know she was in a junction or oppressing in between she didn't know that there was going to be a changing in her life she just heard him say there's going to be a time in the future but then in verse 23 he says he said but the hour cometh and now is when true worshipers shall worship the father and in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship she's and she grabbed the word for her days why she was looking ahead foreign he couldn't even he he bowed down and began to worship and then God said you can't even see my face you can't see my full Glory yes but whenever he came down the mountain what happened to him that same Glory he beheld yes it's the same Glory that was on him and when the people saw him they said Moses you've got to Avail yourself now why because the glory was on him but the glory is his word La glorious and he's not hiding his face from us it's his full word and when you see his glory you become his glory the Bible it says the Bible says when we beheld him when we see him he shall be like him think about it when you see him you'll be like him every day if you're reading your Bible and your message you're looking at him he's here today but he doesn't want to dwell in a Bible he doesn't want to dwell in the message he wants he wants the word manifested in you he wants the word walking and talking that's each and every one of you yes Heavenly Father Lord I ask that the word penetrate the soul fathers Lord it goes beyond feelings it goes beyond Jill's father Lord let it hit the predestinated seeds Lord they will be formed into the living image of the Living God okay just as brother Branham says they just heard from their theophanese lord we give you the glories give you all the honor and the praise Lord we know you're doing something Mighty and tremendous Lord I ask that you awaken every bride every seeds Lord not by Pentecostal movements not by Church names Iglesias not not of of anything else but your word that you can Quicken these people you can Quicken those that are in sin foreign
