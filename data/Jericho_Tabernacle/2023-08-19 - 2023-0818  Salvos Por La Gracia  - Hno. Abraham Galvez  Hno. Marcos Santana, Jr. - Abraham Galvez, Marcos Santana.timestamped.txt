[30:01] the glory of God
[30:03] [Music]
[30:08] Jesus being justified freely by his
[30:11] grace through the Redemption that is in
[30:13] Christ Jesus
[30:16] in proportions
[30:20] [Music]
[30:26] whom God has set forth to be a
[30:29] propitiation through faith in his blood
[30:30] to declare his righteousness for the
[30:33] remission of sins that are passed
[30:35] through the forbearance of god
[30:37] let's bar our heads
[30:40] our loving Heavenly Father
[30:44] Lord we thank you at this time
[30:51] for one more week that you allow us to
[30:53] be here
[30:55] Lord we're asking that you bless the
[30:57] service
[30:59] is
[31:03] [Music]
[31:08] we have something that is beneficial for
[31:10] your people
[31:14] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[31:16] amen
[31:19] Brothers
[31:24] first of all I want to give thanks for
[31:27] the opportunity that I've been given ESS
[31:32] hoping to say something that is
[31:34] beneficial for every one of you no it
[31:36] means
[31:38] for me it's not my intention to say
[31:40] something that isn't right
[31:42] [Music]
[31:46] this evening I want to bring the subject
[31:50] saved by grace
[31:54] how many know that were saved by grace
[31:57] in our Lord
[32:00] speaking along about justification
[32:04] of how God's great love
[32:07] how he was able to come is
[32:13] and justify us of our sins
[32:20] like it says here in diverse we just
[32:22] read for all have sinned and come short
[32:24] of the glory of God
[32:30] it says being justified freely by his
[32:32] grace
[32:35] as you can remember
[32:38] as you can remember in the beginning
[32:44] the entire human race was condemned
[32:48] salvation and Humanity did not have any
[32:52] salvation for their own sins
[32:57] something that seemed that we were all
[33:00] condemned to death
[33:03] there was nothing that a human being can
[33:06] do to save himself
[33:09] by the grace of the Lord
[33:14] that we can come back
[33:18] by faith in his blood
[33:20] by faith in his son
[33:41] this is God in the beginning made a plan
[33:48] he tried to find a way of Escape for
[33:51] himself
[33:53] he tried to make a covering made out of
[33:56] fig leaves
[33:57] that didn't work for him
[34:00] but God made a way for him
[34:09] with him again yes
[34:14] and I was under the shed blood of an
[34:16] innocent substitute yes
[34:20] and that's the only way that God ever
[34:23] did mean
[34:33] it's under the shed blood of an innocent
[34:36] substitute
[34:39] if we go back to the old testamento
[35:02] that was the way man had in in times
[35:05] past
[35:07] to be able to be reconciled with God
[35:09] once again
[35:12] that was the way back then
[35:15] but in today we
[35:40] without having the need of making an
[35:43] animal sacrifice
[35:46] because we have now received our new way
[35:50] for the Forgiveness of sins
[35:54] and the justification of our mistakes
[36:01] it seemed that we had no way to receive
[36:04] salvation
[36:05] is
[36:10] provided that way back
[36:16] to be able to use that way you don't
[36:18] have to pay anything
[36:19] the price was already paid
[36:23] the only thing that God requires from
[36:25] you is your face
[36:29] for you to believe
[36:32] that sacrifice was provided for you
[36:36] I would like to keep reading in Romano
[36:39] cinco in Romans 5 8-9
[36:45] carida para comosotros
[36:51] says commended his love towards us and
[36:55] that while we were yet sinners Christ
[36:57] died for us
[37:01] foreign
[37:06] says much more than being now justified
[37:09] by his blood we shall be saved from
[37:11] wrath through him
[37:25] or if we when we were enemies we were
[37:28] reconciled to God by the death of his
[37:30] son much more being reconciled we shall
[37:32] be saved by his life
[37:35] for when God died in tregando suvida
[37:39] surrendering his life
[37:42] he covered us with that blood
[37:45] is by which we were Justified of our
[37:49] mistakes
[37:50] the blood that saves us
[37:54] of the rap that could have come upon us
[37:58] because as I said
[38:02] we didn't deserve anything but death
[38:09] he provided his son
[38:13] so that we can be saved
[38:16] there was nothing
[38:18] there was no one
[38:20] that could ever do it for us
[38:24] because one man cannot justify another
[38:27] man
[38:28] it's only God can do that
[38:33] a sinner cannot justify the mistake of
[38:35] another sinner
[38:45] because we can find here an example on
[38:47] earth
[38:49] like in the times of the judges
[38:52] in a court setting
[38:55] [Music]
[38:57] an attorney can defend someone that is
[39:00] guilty
[39:04] trying to find a way for him to be found
[39:07] innocent
[39:08] trying to cover up his mistake
[39:12] but that doesn't work with God
[39:17] because one sinner cannot cover up the
[39:19] mistake of another sinner
[39:22] but only the Lord Jesus Christ can save
[39:25] us
[39:29] only the Lord Jesus Christ can justify
[39:32] us before God
[39:37] only under his blood can we be found
[39:40] righteous or just
[39:42] and it's by our faith in him
[39:46] I'll keep reading
[39:48] and the message that's called
[39:55] living dying buried rising and coming
[40:03] you can see why that the Lord to such a
[40:05] degree
[40:08] he must calm down himself
[40:12] and surrender his life
[40:15] for uh some sinners
[40:18] why is it that way
[40:21] I deserves
[40:24] is
[40:26] the only thing that we were we were
[40:28] faulty before the Lord
[40:30] it was because of his love
[40:45] he said he was the greatest the first
[40:47] representation of love that ever hit the
[40:49] Earth yes
[40:53] and was the spies of those who lived on
[40:56] the earth
[40:57] to whom he loved
[41:02] no man could ever love like him
[41:06] and no man was ever hated like him
[41:12] they hated him and despised him and
[41:14] rejected him
[41:17] but it did not stop his love is
[41:23] this is the last one he was hanging on
[41:25] the cross
[41:31] after that life that he had lived had
[41:34] been done nothing but good things
[41:39] forgiving the guilty
[41:41] Healing The Sick yes
[41:44] and just things that were good
[41:49] this is when he had his chest hanging
[41:52] there on the cross
[41:56] when he with his last press on the cross
[41:58] with that vulgar mocking spit of them
[42:00] who stood by either
[42:05] hanging from his sacred face he cried
[42:10] with the Heart full of love father
[42:12] forgive them for they know not what they
[42:14] do is
[42:17] that's something sad at the same time
[42:19] it's something that is already Grand is
[42:21] three things
[42:24] it's so sad in the sense that house is
[42:27] possible that person that is so full of
[42:28] love
[42:31] a person that never did anything wrong
[42:33] against mankind
[42:36] even even still he was despised
[42:43] and the only reason that was in his
[42:45] heart was love for us
[42:50] at that time mankind could have received
[42:53] death because of that
[42:57] he could have said you know what just
[42:59] destroy them
[43:00] look what they did to me
[43:06] that there was a portion
[43:09] which did have faith in him
[43:13] which did accept him and loved him
[43:17] and because of that portion
[43:21] he surrendered his life
[43:24] to save us yes
[43:29] along with all the rest that were able
[43:31] to come
[43:37] the sacrifice for whosoever believeth in
[43:40] him
[43:42] that there was no uh God was not a
[43:44] respecter of persons
[43:47] because the Lord surrendered his life
[43:49] for the sinner
[43:53] for whom it seemed that there was no
[43:55] salvation for their life foreign
[44:04] he surrendered his life to be able to
[44:06] save you and I
[44:09] it's uh incredible to think
[44:12] how he came aciano to us
[44:19] and to think that every one of us is
[44:21] here by his grace
[44:27] thankfully it hasn't happened to me is
[44:35] where it seemed that they didn't deserve
[44:38] anything
[44:39] where it seemed that no one loved us
[44:44] when it seemed that our life was
[44:47] completely gone
[44:49] he then came to us
[44:53] in a different way someone approached
[44:56] you
[44:58] and showed you that the Lord was able to
[45:01] save you
[45:03] he showed God's love towards mankind
[45:08] that even we while we were yet sinners
[45:11] he loved us
[45:15] regardless of what we have ever done
[45:18] he can forgive you
[45:21] forget your past
[45:25] but the Lord only wants you to accept
[45:28] his blood is
[45:31] and your sins will be covered and wiped
[45:34] away from his remembrance
[45:37] and to be justified by that Divine blood
[45:41] as the song says
[45:44] it's the blood that gives me peace
[45:47] is the blood that justifies me
[45:51] Jesus it's the precious blood of Jesus
[45:56] there's nothing in this mankind that is
[45:59] able to justify man
[46:02] to justify the mistake of our paste
[46:06] on the world can remind us of the things
[46:10] of the wrong things that we have done
[46:12] but God can't remember it anymore
[46:18] at the moment that you come before the
[46:21] Judgment the trial
[46:24] but you accepted the sacrifice
[46:28] you believed in that blood
[46:33] and you let that blood to cleanse and
[46:36] justify you
[46:38] and to cleanse every part of your being
[46:42] at the moment that you come before that
[46:45] trial Diablo and the devil wants to
[46:48] accuse you
[46:50] the Lord will say I can't see anything
[46:53] I just see one of my sons
[46:57] I just see a person that's cleansed and
[47:00] just
[47:02] but he might say well look he did this
[47:04] and that he says I can't remember it
[47:09] I don't know if you were mistaken by
[47:12] what person did it
[47:16] but he's one of my children and I don't
[47:18] remember him doing that
[47:20] is
[47:22] what you're saying about him is no
[47:24] longer in my remembrance
[47:26] you you can come in then
[47:30] I would like to keep reading
[47:32] in a very perfect in the message of
[47:35] perfect Faith
[47:38] remembering that great love of Our Lord
[47:42] of how he loved us
[47:48] when it appeared that we were nothing
[47:53] why why is it that he was able to love
[47:56] us while we were yet nothing
[47:58] I would like to read in the message
[48:00] perfect faith
[48:02] in uh page 21.
[48:06] a paragraph 433
[48:09] brother Branham says
[48:12] he says he caught me when I was nothing
[48:16] I'm still nothing
[48:18] he says but I am in his hand
[48:23] see he called me and he loved me
[48:28] when I was unlovable
[48:48] she said I'm not what I ought to be
[48:51] in peril
[48:53] ous area said I'm not what I ought to be
[48:59] no solo
[49:00] he says and I'm not what I want to be
[49:03] but then I'm not what I used to be
[49:07] when it seemed that no one loved us
[49:11] when it seemed that we were nothing
[49:14] he loved us
[49:17] and how many here wants to be in his
[49:20] hands
[49:22] I believe that should be the desire
[49:25] Jesus to be in the hand of Jesus of our
[49:29] God
[49:31] and allow for him to change us
[49:39] like I mentioned before how many of the
[49:41] Christians that were here now in church
[49:43] were at times past in the world
[49:46] just imagine that love
[49:51] being going from a person that was lost
[49:55] and now you're sitting here
[49:59] and you have now a testimony that you
[50:01] can tell others
[50:04] and to be able to say the Lord love me
[50:08] and by his blood I am now saved
[50:12] maybe we're not the perfect Christian
[50:16] a Christian will always have its
[50:18] mistakes
[50:20] the human aspect in our being is
[50:24] this flesh is not taken away
[50:30] always be prone to make mistakes
[50:34] but we have a way
[50:37] that we can go back to Edition
[50:43] I'm not saying that I'm going to
[50:45] deliberately make a mistake then go back
[50:46] to him so he can forgive me no I'm not
[50:49] saying that it's the Lord forgives you
[50:53] and he cleanses you
[50:56] continue but it's a constant struggle
[50:58] you say
[51:00] and you have to continue fighting
[51:03] to press forward
[51:06] until you reach that last day
[51:10] when we're finally meeting our Lord
[51:14] and being now Justified
[51:17] we have peace now
[51:21] knowing that the Lord is in us
[51:25] and that blood covers Us
[51:29] and there's nothing that can accuse us
[51:34] and we now have the best Advocate upon
[51:37] this Earth
[51:41] I want to go back to that message of
[51:43] living and dying
[51:46] buried Rising
[51:48] in the
[51:50] Bank
[51:51] page nine program 37.
[51:55] this is
[51:58] when something is buried it's then
[52:01] hidden
[52:02] it's out of sight
[52:40] because
[52:51] they're out of his memory
[53:15] our sins are erased from his remembrance
[53:20] I can only remember the story
[53:24] I think it was an elder minister
[53:32] every time he would read the Bible he
[53:34] would just simply rejoice and run all
[53:36] over his house
[53:39] but his uh his daughter was embarrassed
[53:41] was ashamed or embarrassed of him
[53:47] and one time there were some friends
[53:49] from the church that were up from that
[53:51] City that were coming over
[53:57] and she convinced him by making him
[54:00] think that he wouldn't want to be in
[54:01] that Gathering
[54:06] she said Dad if you want you can go up
[54:08] there to the Attic
[54:12] So she plants or her Dad wouldn't be as
[54:16] scandalous
[54:19] she took away his Bible and gave him a
[54:22] book of geography
[54:24] at the time of them Gathering so look
[54:31] they can only hear in the upper part of
[54:33] the house a bunch of amens and
[54:35] Hallelujah and praise God
[54:38] and they were just realized they were
[54:40] just noticing how that sound from up
[54:43] there will come down to the bottom part
[54:47] and the daughter in such a hurry ran to
[54:50] the attic where her father was at
[54:53] possible
[54:56] she said how is it that you're rejoicing
[54:58] if I just only gave you a book of
[55:00] geography
[55:03] and she said sweetie in this book of
[55:06] geography that you gave me this thing is
[55:12] there's it says that there's certain
[55:15] parts of the sea that they haven't able
[55:17] to hit the bottom of the of it yet
[55:20] and me yesterday I read a scripture
[55:25] that says that he sent my sins to the
[55:28] sea of forgetfulness
[55:32] and I'm rejoicing and knowing that no
[55:35] one is able to find my sins
[55:38] that should be such a joy for us
[55:40] Christians
[55:43] maybe because the world can remember our
[55:46] mistake
[55:48] but the Lord cannot remember it
[55:51] he does not remember your flaws
[55:54] he does not remember your mistakes
[55:58] he only knows what you are currently now
[56:03] but we have to continue struggling and
[56:06] fighting
[56:07] to press forward following our Lord
[56:12] because this battle this struggle it has
[56:15] no end
[56:17] this is just merely the beginning
[56:20] and we're not also now reaching the end
[56:24] asking the Lord is
[56:28] each day we can be closer to him
[56:32] we can reach his presence even more
[56:36] and what are even more Blessed Assurance
[56:41] knowing that we have the path laid out
[56:45] that we must repent from our hearts
[56:50] first of all someone has to repent from
[56:53] all their heart this will wrote of their
[56:55] mistake
[57:05] or wherever you are
[57:08] until you know
[57:12] that you entirely from your inner self
[57:17] has been cast out yes
[57:20] and now you have the insurance
[57:27] and you say Lord I don't want to come up
[57:30] from this place
[57:32] until I know that I'm in your presence
[57:36] until I know that you have me in your
[57:39] hand
[57:41] until I know that you are in me
[57:45] until I feel that I won't get up Lord
[57:51] the time goes too quickly
[57:55] and now it's over for me
[57:58] I can only say
[58:01] s
[58:02] that we have received God's grace
[58:08] that when apparently we didn't deserve
[58:11] anything but death it was just he
[58:14] stretched out his hand to us
[58:17] and he brought us out from where we were
[58:23] someone else uh no no one else would
[58:25] have gone for you and I were rewarded
[58:29] where no one else would have paid a
[58:32] penny for us
[58:34] he gave his own life for us
[58:38] and what is more valuable than that
[58:42] and I want to tell the use
[58:44] and especially this
[58:48] salvation is individual
[59:02] or my grandfather they serve here in the
[59:05] church
[59:09] you're Justified and saved
[59:13] not because of that is
[59:17] but it has to be a personal experience
[59:19] for you
[59:21] a personal longing
[59:24] to seek out the Lord
[59:27] so may God help us
[59:30] may we continue to press forward
[59:47] God bless our brother Abraham
[59:53] I knew it was going to be something
[59:55] special
[59:56] [Music]
[59:58] when I saw the announcement that I was
[1:00:00] going to minister along with him
[1:00:03] hearing him right now
[1:00:09] speaking in Spanish
[1:00:12] hearing him now
[1:00:14] um
[1:00:15] in the back before we came I opened up a
[1:00:18] bit with him
[1:00:19] and I asked permission
[1:00:22] to talk about this
[1:01:03] and he was talking how he was so
[1:01:06] discouraged of uh how it is here in the
[1:01:08] U.S
[1:01:09] companies
[1:01:12] that the fellowship in love and Revival
[1:01:15] is not the same here as it is in his
[1:01:16] country of El Salvador
[1:01:18] and he's almost in tears telling me this
[1:01:21] is
[1:01:24] how is it that the church that he
[1:01:26] attended when they came here
[1:01:28] right away they put on the preach and he
[1:01:31] didn't want to uh instrumentals to play
[1:01:34] an instrument and he didn't want to uh
[1:01:38] and he didn't want him
[1:01:44] it seemed that the devil was attacking
[1:01:46] and oppressing or weighing down on our
[1:01:48] brother Abraham
[1:01:50] [Music]
[1:01:52] and because of that I grew very fond of
[1:01:54] him
[1:02:02] and in my heart I was praying for him
[1:02:07] more than that I know that he was
[1:02:08] praying
[1:02:11] now from these months afterwards when we
[1:02:14] came back from El Salvador
[1:02:16] located
[1:02:18] for me it's so incredible what God can
[1:02:20] do in a human being
[1:02:23] the love that he has when he sings to
[1:02:25] the Lord
[1:02:28] the joy that he has to learn new
[1:02:30] instruments
[1:02:34] and now to be ministering God's words to
[1:02:36] God's people
[1:02:39] to continue in the footsteps of his
[1:02:41] ground
[1:02:49] and for me and he set the setting
[1:02:52] tonight
[1:02:55] and we're just gonna right now just
[1:02:57] finish it offering
[1:03:00] as the brother said the title is saved
[1:03:03] by grace
[1:03:07] and I want to my my part is I want to go
[1:03:11] back to the foundation
[1:03:14] using the same scripture that our
[1:03:16] brother used in romanoes and Romans 323
[1:03:19] English
[1:03:21] and my notes are in English so I'll
[1:03:23] switch over to English Romans 3 23
[1:03:27] for all have sinned and come short of
[1:03:30] the glory of God is
[1:03:34] that you this evening
[1:03:37] all fallen short of the glory of God
[1:03:42] and when we were getting ready for this
[1:03:44] service
[1:03:46] the brother told me he was going to
[1:03:48] speak on justification
[1:03:51] but I think he's preached justification
[1:03:54] sanctification in the New Birth just now
[1:04:00] you know brother oh brother ordonius is
[1:04:02] a very serious man
[1:04:05] but if you could see from back here
[1:04:08] the big smile that's on his face as he
[1:04:11] was listening to her brother Abraham
[1:04:13] Minister
[1:04:16] I know that he can tell there's a gift
[1:04:19] in that young man
[1:04:22] and I told the brother I'll speak a
[1:04:24] little bit more towards justification
[1:04:26] sanctification and the the new birth
[1:04:33] because he had told me brother I'm only
[1:04:36] going to speak on justification tonight
[1:04:40] and I found a quote before he told me
[1:04:43] that
[1:04:45] or I found a quote and it says like this
[1:04:49] and the message once more Lord
[1:04:52] an old minister went and preached
[1:04:54] justification at a Revival this is
[1:05:01] the second night third night fourth
[1:05:03] night fifth night
[1:05:06] and then the deacons they called him out
[1:05:10] and they said to him
[1:05:12] Reverend don't you know any more than
[1:05:15] just a sermon on justification
[1:05:20] he said oh sure I do
[1:05:24] but let them all get Justified first
[1:05:28] Jose
[1:05:31] and then we'll preach on something else
[1:05:35] that's right and then brother Branham
[1:05:39] adds on to that
[1:05:41] oh if you could only get back to that
[1:05:44] foundation
[1:05:48] so when I had this cruel and then
[1:05:50] brother Abraham said I'm just going to
[1:05:52] speak on justification
[1:05:57] I said praise God because we ain't got
[1:05:59] to preach on anything else
[1:06:03] and this is a youth service
[1:06:06] so if we can preach on justification
[1:06:10] if we could preach on sanctification
[1:06:13] and preach on that new birth
[1:06:16] maybe we can get a young person
[1:06:18] somewhere tonight
[1:06:22] you know and I'm trusting that the young
[1:06:25] people here this evening know what the
[1:06:26] what the ABCs are yes
[1:06:36] but you know it's funny to me
[1:06:39] because uh I I every time I see brother
[1:06:42] brothers
[1:06:44] you know he's so connected into the
[1:06:47] messages
[1:06:48] you know he can even finish your
[1:06:50] sentences as you're preaching
[1:06:55] what an amazing thing if one day we see
[1:06:57] our youth come into service so connected
[1:07:04] they'll be finishing the preacher's
[1:07:06] sentence
[1:07:08] so young people I trust you know what
[1:07:11] your ABCs are this evening
[1:07:16] always believe Christ
[1:07:19] when you're in trouble always believe
[1:07:21] Christ
[1:07:23] when you're sick always believe Christ
[1:07:26] when you're in school always believe
[1:07:28] Christ
[1:07:30] always believe Christ
[1:07:33] when everything's going good in your
[1:07:35] life just always believe Christ
[1:07:39] in the good and the bad times
[1:07:42] in the hard times and in the easy times
[1:07:47] always believe Christ
[1:07:51] you know I know you've heard it and
[1:07:53] you've been taught
[1:07:55] and there's nothing new to you
[1:07:58] so we're just here to remind you tonight
[1:08:00] of those ABCs again
[1:08:05] and we want to just put a little
[1:08:06] emphasis like our brother just did
[1:08:10] on justification sanctification and
[1:08:13] receiving the new birth
[1:08:17] and why do we want to put a little
[1:08:19] emphasis on that
[1:08:22] if you can be honest with yourself
[1:08:24] tonight
[1:08:27] and I know we don't have too many youth
[1:08:30] tonight
[1:08:31] so maybe God wanted to send this message
[1:08:34] to the older folks this evening
[1:08:38] if you're honest with yourself tonight
[1:08:42] some of us are in justification
[1:08:46] some of us are in sanctification
[1:08:49] some of us have received the Holy Ghost
[1:08:54] so nobody should be embarrassed
[1:08:59] nobody should be ashamed
[1:09:02] of the state that you're in this evening
[1:09:07] it don't matter what state you're in
[1:09:09] this evening
[1:09:12] because if everybody had the new birth
[1:09:14] tonight
[1:09:17] and we're just waiting on one single
[1:09:21] Persona well then we're not going
[1:09:22] anywhere till that one person comes in
[1:09:28] Jesus Christ is coming for a complete
[1:09:38] young person might be here tonight yes
[1:09:43] that's why we're preaching these Friday
[1:09:45] night services foreign
[1:10:31] when Samson Was Defeated and blinded and
[1:10:34] Shackled upon
[1:10:38] that's exactly where God wanted him
[1:10:42] because that's where God wanted them to
[1:10:45] bring them up a little higher
[1:10:49] he wanted to take them to the next step
[1:10:53] get them a little closer to God
[1:10:56] so if you're here justification
[1:10:59] sanctification or you're born again
[1:11:03] after today God wants to take you to the
[1:11:06] next step
[1:11:09] you're already in the best place that
[1:11:11] you can be yes
[1:11:14] you know my ring up almost every day I
[1:11:17] get messages
[1:11:21] 35th and Baseline someone was murdered
[1:11:28] 27th in Dobby and someone was kidding
[1:11:32] but you know what we have here
[1:11:35] we're in the best place that we can be
[1:11:40] physically speaking right here listening
[1:11:42] to the word of God
[1:11:46] and spiritually speaking
[1:11:49] the best place that we can be
[1:11:53] is be in Christ Jesus
[1:11:56] that's where I want to be is
[1:11:59] in in the Book of John 14 17.
[1:12:04] it says even the spirit of Truth whom
[1:12:07] the world cannot receive because it
[1:12:09] seeth him not neither knoweth him
[1:12:22] every one of you young people knows him
[1:12:27] how do you know him
[1:12:29] whether you want to believe it or not
[1:12:32] you are a child of God
[1:12:36] you are predestinated
[1:12:39] I believe it you need to believe it
[1:12:42] your mama and daddy believes it
[1:12:45] you were born
[1:12:47] you might be wandering in the chicken
[1:12:50] coop
[1:12:51] but when that ego hears that mother
[1:12:53] Eagle
[1:12:56] it can't help but identify with that
[1:12:59] sounds
[1:13:01] they can't identify it can't help but
[1:13:04] identify with that word
[1:13:06] identification because it knows him
[1:13:10] and the verse continues foreign
[1:14:12] just like when we're baptized
[1:14:15] that beautiful word that he shall is
[1:14:20] he shall give you the Holy Ghost
[1:14:23] it's not now it's in the future but it's
[1:14:27] a promise that he'll be in you
[1:14:31] it's great that he's with me
[1:14:34] it's a great thing he watches over me
[1:14:38] but I want that seal I want that token
[1:14:42] I want him to be inside of me
[1:14:46] it's not enough for the rain to fall on
[1:14:48] me
[1:14:50] but I wanted to penetrate deep inside of
[1:14:53] it
[1:14:56] I want Christ to live in me
[1:15:00] that is the Salvation and that is the
[1:15:03] eternal life
[1:15:05] in the message confirmation of the
[1:15:08] commission
[1:15:09] but Brandon says
[1:15:12] and and if y'all don't know me by now
[1:15:16] I don't like to get too deep on things
[1:15:20] so when brother Brandon says something
[1:15:22] that don't take much Revelation
[1:15:27] for me I feel like he's talking just to
[1:15:30] me but I mean
[1:15:32] so young people listening I believe the
[1:15:36] gospel is simple
[1:15:39] the Bible said
[1:15:42] it's so simple that a fool shouldn't air
[1:15:45] is
[1:15:48] so just all you have to do
[1:15:52] is remember a b c is
[1:15:57] you know what it stands for is
[1:16:00] always believe Christ
[1:16:03] that's all you have to do
[1:16:06] since that settles it is
[1:16:10] ABC and you're fully educated
[1:16:26] and you're fully educated as far as I'm
[1:16:29] concerned
[1:16:33] so young people we all know what the
[1:16:35] Holy Ghost is
[1:16:39] very simple the Holy Ghost is the spirit
[1:16:41] of God
[1:16:45] that when we receive the spirit of God
[1:16:49] it's simply the spirit of God living in
[1:16:52] you it's implemented
[1:16:55] it's a seal it's a sign it's a covenant
[1:17:00] and we all have the opportunity to
[1:17:03] receive that field
[1:17:06] to be a part of God
[1:17:09] and that's through a three-step process
[1:17:39] Believing on God receiving him as your
[1:17:42] personal Savior
[1:17:45] and being baptized
[1:17:47] second is sanctification of the spirit
[1:17:52] that God cleanses the spirit from all
[1:17:55] the elements of the world
[1:17:59] and all the desires of the world
[1:18:03] and then the Holy Spirit comes in and
[1:18:07] gives the new birth and
[1:18:12] fills up that Sanctified vessel
[1:18:16] so we want to make it as simple as
[1:18:18] possible tonight
[1:18:22] justification is believing
[1:18:26] sanctification is cleaning
[1:18:30] and baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:18:32] receiving
[1:18:35] so justification is believing
[1:18:40] believe in the good news Gospel of Jesus
[1:18:43] Christ
[1:18:45] that Jesus Christ died on the cross for
[1:18:47] me
[1:18:49] believing and understanding I am a
[1:18:52] sinner
[1:18:54] and get it to that point of getting rid
[1:18:56] of that self-pride that we have
[1:19:02] where we believe and know that I deserve
[1:19:05] death
[1:19:08] but Jesus Christ came on the scene
[1:19:12] and he died just personally for me
[1:19:17] you know there was some point in our
[1:19:20] lives
[1:19:21] like our brother was saying it was
[1:19:23] bringing me to tears
[1:19:27] we heard a message we heard a preaching
[1:19:31] there was a word of God that spoke to
[1:19:33] you
[1:19:35] and it spoke directly to you
[1:19:39] and that's where that Faith was starting
[1:19:41] to be born
[1:19:44] it started to grow inside of you
[1:19:47] and sometimes we underestimate just how
[1:19:49] simple faith is
[1:19:53] the word says faith comes by hearing the
[1:19:55] word of God
[1:19:59] you push play Just Hear It
[1:20:03] You Stream a service just hear it
[1:20:07] you come to service like tonight just
[1:20:10] hear it
[1:20:13] you know your Consciousness might be
[1:20:15] distracted
[1:20:17] you're tired you're hungry you're you're
[1:20:20] bored
[1:20:23] but your subconscious is catching every
[1:20:25] bit of word that's being spoken
[1:20:31] it's like when you're in a classroom or
[1:20:34] in a
[1:20:37] seminario and you're bored and tired
[1:20:41] and you're not even paying attention
[1:20:44] and then I don't know where the speaker
[1:20:46] ends
[1:20:49] and he might say all right now the first
[1:20:51] 10 people to come to the front I'm going
[1:20:53] to give them a hundred dollars
[1:21:00] Something Told me even though I wasn't
[1:21:02] paying attention
[1:21:05] oh they're giving out a hundred dollars
[1:21:07] and I run to the front this is because
[1:21:12] subconscious was list was hearing that
[1:21:14] word
[1:21:17] it wasn't listening it wasn't
[1:21:19] understanding
[1:21:21] that's just like it says faith cometh
[1:21:24] just by hearing the words
[1:21:28] Peter's like Peterson
[1:21:32] you know Silver and Gold Have I None he
[1:21:34] said
[1:21:35] tonight I don't have a hundred dollars
[1:21:37] to give you
[1:21:38] but he said but what I do have
[1:21:41] I will give that to you and he gave that
[1:21:45] man his healing
[1:21:47] how did he give him that healing because
[1:21:50] they are the light of the world we are
[1:21:52] the light of the world
[1:21:54] we are God's Representatives
[1:21:58] we carry God's power and his authorities
[1:22:03] because we've got the Holy Ghost Inside
[1:22:06] of us
[1:22:09] when the minister says if you want your
[1:22:11] healing
[1:22:24] you want salvation come forward
[1:22:27] you want the New Birth come in this
[1:22:30] prayer line
[1:22:32] because it's not the man giving you that
[1:22:36] if I could give you that I can't give
[1:22:40] you that I'm better off giving you a
[1:22:42] hundred dollars
[1:22:43] but the Holy Ghost in that minister
[1:22:48] is the one that gives that power
[1:22:51] it's the one that has that Authority
[1:22:54] so let's remember how simple it is
[1:22:59] Faith Comes just by hearing word of God
[1:23:04] let it build up inside of you
[1:23:08] it's already built up inside
[1:23:13] and it'll create an experience
[1:23:16] it'll take you to the Waters of baptism
[1:23:19] where you understand I need Jesus Christ
[1:23:22] in my life
[1:23:24] and you'll make that public display
[1:23:26] amongst everyone
[1:23:30] where you recognize the only path I can
[1:23:32] be on
[1:23:35] is the path of Salvation and eternal
[1:23:38] life
[1:23:40] because I recognize he's the way the
[1:23:42] truth in the life
[1:23:45] but then we enter into sanctification
[1:23:49] and that is that cleaning yes we've
[1:23:53] accepted Christ already
[1:23:55] we've gotten baptized we went into the
[1:23:59] water with the pitch black heart
[1:24:03] you know I guess if we couldn't
[1:24:05] categorize it by numbers
[1:24:08] [Music]
[1:24:10] maybe the whole older you are the more
[1:24:13] sins you carry in that black heart of
[1:24:14] yours
[1:24:17] maybe millions or billions of sins that
[1:24:20] you have he says
[1:24:25] mental sins physical sins little sins
[1:24:29] big sins whatever it is
[1:24:38] when we come out of those Waters
[1:24:41] we're wiped clean you know that's why
[1:24:44] you hear so many testimonies
[1:24:47] that people say I just felt so light
[1:24:49] when I came out the water
[1:24:52] I felt so clean
[1:24:55] I felt so free
[1:24:58] you know I look at my sister right here
[1:25:01] I forget your name sister
[1:25:03] but you know when she got baptized
[1:25:06] I didn't see mud on her face
[1:25:10] I didn't see a weighted vest
[1:25:20] but those shackles that filth that way
[1:25:23] is the weight of sin that was on our
[1:25:24] lives
[1:25:29] when you come out of those Waters
[1:25:32] you come out like a fresh start white
[1:25:35] and clean
[1:25:37] with the heart that no longer has any
[1:25:40] more sins
[1:25:43] what then Begins the sanctification
[1:25:45] process
[1:25:48] and during this process Satan's going to
[1:25:51] try and keep you down
[1:25:54] make you doubt your experience
[1:25:57] but I want to make it very clear for the
[1:25:59] young people
[1:26:02] it don't matter what you've done in your
[1:26:05] past
[1:26:07] what you thought what she said what you
[1:26:10] watched
[1:26:12] when it says all your sins are forgiven
[1:26:18] every single sin has been forgiven
[1:26:22] so when the devil wants to remind you
[1:26:25] know why don't you try using this
[1:26:29] just tell them all right devil thank you
[1:26:31] for reminding me
[1:26:34] of what I used to do
[1:26:37] like our brother said I'm not what I
[1:26:39] want to be
[1:26:41] but I ain't what I used to be
[1:26:44] so thank you for reminding me
[1:26:47] but God already forgave me
[1:26:50] you don't see me like that no more
[1:26:53] so therefore you can't make me be there
[1:26:56] no more
[1:26:58] your sins are forgiveness
[1:27:01] it's a great feeling to come out of
[1:27:04] those Waters
[1:27:06] with that weight of sin lifted up off of
[1:27:09] you
[1:27:11] but the the that that serpent nature is
[1:27:15] still in that heart
[1:27:18] it's why it's clean
[1:27:21] but the producer of sin is still in
[1:27:24] there
[1:27:26] no maybe those millions of sins are gone
[1:27:28] he says
[1:27:31] but the next day
[1:27:33] with the fresh start
[1:27:36] you got one new sin yes and at the end
[1:27:40] of the week you've got ten new sins
[1:27:43] a month you've got a hundred new sins
[1:27:47] but they were wiped clean
[1:27:49] but I've been baptized yeah but now
[1:27:53] you're responsible for every new sin you
[1:27:55] commence
[1:27:59] but the amazing thing young people
[1:28:02] is that now that you're a part of this
[1:28:05] family
[1:28:07] you have access to the father Lord
[1:28:11] had a horrible week
[1:28:14] school was so difficult
[1:28:17] no I was trying not to use those drugs
[1:28:22] I was trying not to watch those things
[1:28:25] I was trying not to fall into those
[1:28:28] mental places that I get into yeah
[1:28:34] so but forgive me Lord
[1:28:37] like our brother said
[1:28:39] forgive you from what
[1:28:42] I didn't see anything
[1:28:44] I didn't see you smoke I didn't see when
[1:28:48] you thought of those things
[1:28:50] you're forgivenado and if we can confess
[1:28:54] our sins
[1:29:04] but in that
[1:29:06] momento remember the nature of sin is
[1:29:09] still in that heart
[1:29:12] and I'm trying to close forgive me
[1:29:16] you know like our brother Luis and her
[1:29:18] brother Victor said last week
[1:29:21] in that sanctification process
[1:29:24] it's time to keep on walking
[1:29:31] it's not about fighting keep on trusting
[1:29:34] and a little tip for you young people
[1:29:37] you know
[1:29:38] all those worldly things that your flesh
[1:29:41] likes doing
[1:29:44] you're still gonna like doing them
[1:29:48] because the nature is still in that
[1:29:50] heart
[1:29:53] but we need to fight foreign
[1:30:06] keep on pushing place
[1:30:08] keep on coming to church
[1:30:11] keep putting your sacrifice at the
[1:30:15] altarification and one day maybe today
[1:30:20] it's your day with that nature of sin
[1:30:24] will die
[1:30:25] but you don't have to struggle with that
[1:30:28] no more
[1:30:30] and that serpent nature will be
[1:30:32] eliminated
[1:30:37] the nature of God still isn't inside of
[1:30:40] you
[1:30:42] the Serpent's gone
[1:30:47] you're clean it is
[1:30:50] Blanco but the Dove's not there yet
[1:30:55] sanctification is cleansing and cleaning
[1:30:58] of the spirit
[1:31:02] getting ready for the baptism of the
[1:31:06] Holy Spirit
[1:31:10] that's what God does through
[1:31:11] sanctification
[1:31:14] he takes all the desires of sin out of
[1:31:17] your heart
[1:31:22] and then he makes you a candidate for
[1:31:25] being filled with the Holy ghosts
[1:31:33] positions could come forward
[1:31:36] you are now a candidate for being filled
[1:31:39] with the Holy Ghost
[1:31:43] and being that you're a candidate
[1:31:46] means you still don't have it
[1:31:50] I've been Justified
[1:31:52] I've been Sanctified
[1:31:54] I believed
[1:31:59] but you're in a danger zone foreign
[1:32:23] you seem like a Christian now
[1:32:26] but you're still not born again
[1:32:30] you don't have that Dove nature yet
[1:32:34] and the devil's going to get back on the
[1:32:37] job again and again
[1:32:41] trying for us not to make it to that
[1:32:44] promised land
[1:32:48] to receive that Holy Ghost for ourselves
[1:32:52] but he knows he can't come with those
[1:32:55] old things I used to like but
[1:32:59] those fleshly desires they've been taken
[1:33:02] away from me already
[1:33:05] so it's a very delicate stage
[1:33:09] if we're not careful
[1:33:11] if we're not careful
[1:33:14] you can be filled with a religious
[1:33:17] spirit foreign
[1:33:57] Jesus said that in that day
[1:34:00] okay
[1:34:02] will come to me
[1:34:03] and they'll say Lord have I not done
[1:34:06] this and that in your name
[1:34:09] but I didn't even know you
[1:34:12] know we can be in that state this
[1:34:14] evening
[1:34:16] we're not careful we can get caught up
[1:34:18] in that state
[1:34:22] but young people do you remember
[1:34:25] Brandon being asked
[1:34:28] how long does it take to receive the new
[1:34:30] birth
[1:34:34] his response
[1:34:36] however long it takes for you to fully
[1:34:39] surrender to the Lord
[1:34:44] it was a
[1:34:45] Israelites about 11 days to make it to
[1:34:48] the promised land
[1:34:53] but because they couldn't surrender
[1:34:57] it took him 40 years
[1:35:00] maybe that's why it's taken you this
[1:35:03] long foreign
[1:35:05] you should have had it last week
[1:35:09] you should have had it a month ago a
[1:35:11] year ago
[1:35:14] but remember God has you right where he
[1:35:17] wants you tonight
[1:35:20] if you want the new birth tonight
[1:35:23] you can have it right where you're at
[1:35:27] if you want the baptism of the Holy
[1:35:29] Ghost tonight
[1:35:31] you can have it right where you're at
[1:35:34] tonight
[1:35:36] brother says and then Jesus said
[1:35:41] blessed are ye every one of you
[1:35:45] say this that when you hunger
[1:35:48] and users for righteousness
[1:35:53] you shall be filled
[1:35:55] the Holy Ghost came for the Sanctified
[1:36:01] for the Real and True Sanctified
[1:36:04] Believers
[1:36:07] so that the signs and wonders could
[1:36:09] manifest in you
[1:36:11] is
[1:36:14] Sanctified vessels
[1:36:17] so that the Holy Ghost could get into
[1:36:20] that
[1:36:22] bow your hands for prayer
[1:36:26] don't settle for nothing less than an
[1:36:29] old-fashioned experience of the new
[1:36:30] birth
[1:36:33] experience
[1:36:36] so be born again
[1:36:39] of the spirit of the Eternal God
[1:36:42] when your soul and God they unite to
[1:37:15] but it's when you're ready to die to
[1:37:17] yourself
[1:37:20] then you can be born again and
[1:37:24] you can be a new creature in Christ
[1:37:26] Jesus
[1:37:29] Jesus because you've accepted the person
[1:37:32] of Jesus Christ
[1:37:35] our brother Abraham said
[1:37:38] he said to all the youths
[1:37:41] it has to be a personal experience with
[1:37:45] God foreign
[1:38:45] of it through you we are Justified
[1:38:47] foreign
[1:39:38] [Laughter]
