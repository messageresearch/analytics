[49:37] heavenly father this morning we gave you

[50:04] may you bless us

[50:14] [Music]
[50:27] just like you said in your prayers
[50:31] give us our daily bread
[50:34] and that is what we need today
[50:37] we ask lord for these favors
[50:49] just like we're standing when i read the
[50:51] two scriptures in the bible
[50:57] the first one is going to be fine in
[50:58] revelations the third chapter the
[51:00] seventh verse
[51:04] we can please say amen once you have it
[51:07] [Music]
[51:12] the word says
[51:24] and to the angels the church in
[51:26] philadelphia write these things saith he
[51:28] that is holy he that is true he that
[51:30] hath the key of david he that openeth
[51:33] and no man shutteth and shutteth and no
[51:34] man openness
[51:48] i know thy works behold i have set
[51:50] before thee an open door and no man can
[51:52] shut it for that has little strength and
[51:54] has kept my word and has not denied my
[51:57] name
[51:59] now in leviticus the 25th chapter
[52:04] [Music]
[52:21] then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the
[52:23] jubilee to sound on the on the tenth day
[52:25] of the seventh month and the day of the
[52:27] atonement shall you make the trumpet
[52:28] sound throughout all your land is
[52:45] shall hallow the 50th year and proclaim
[52:47] liberty throughout all the land onto all
[52:49] the inhabitants thereof it shall be a
[52:51] jubilee unto you and you shall return
[52:53] every man onto his possession and you
[52:55] shall return every man onto his family
[53:06] a jubilee shall that 50th year be unto
[53:08] you you shall not sow neither reap that
[53:10] which groweth of itself in it nor gather
[53:13] the grapes in it of divine undressed
[53:22] for it is a jubilee it shall be holy on
[53:24] to you you should eat the increase there
[53:26] out of the field
[53:32] in the year of the jubilee you should
[53:33] return every man on to his position
[53:38] may the lord bless turn over his word
[53:39] you may take your seats
[53:42] we thank the musicians as well
[53:46] for the atmosphere that they have
[53:48] created
[53:51] i forget where brother brown says
[54:12] that determines if god wants to reveal
[54:14] his word or not
[54:18] so the type of atmosphere that you're
[54:20] forming is
[54:24] i will determine if god's going to
[54:26] reveal to you something this morning
[54:31] a portion to fulfill this morning
[54:35] you have an atmosphere that you have to
[54:37] create
[54:41] so the holy spirit can feel well enough
[54:46] to reveal himself to you
[54:50] continue
[54:52] and this morning i'd like to speak on
[54:54] the year of the jubilee
[54:56] it is
[54:58] this is the 11th part ireland
[55:02] israel in their homeland
[55:16] israel has their homeland yes
[55:46] has different
[56:00] and the scripture that we read in
[56:01] revelations the third chapter
[56:06] it says he that has the key of david
[56:11] now that he represents something very
[56:13] important
[56:29] elise
[56:32] says but the law required a kinsmen
[56:35] redeemer
[56:38] the law required a kinsmen redeemer
[56:42] you want to mark it down kinsman
[56:44] redeemer
[56:48] leviticus 25.
[56:51] that's the scripture that we finished
[56:53] reading
[56:56] it speaks of the year of jubilee
[57:00] now the day of the atonement is the
[57:02] expression what is in atonement
[57:05] in atonement
[57:08] is the offering for sin
[57:11] when the sacrifice is dead entonces
[57:14] [Music]
[57:16] the priest therefore gets a trumpet
[57:20] he begins to play the trumpet
[57:24] that everyone who hears the trumpet
[57:28] he can know that he's free us
[57:32] now you've heard the gospel
[57:36] you have heard that you can be free
[57:41] tomorrow but that is a decision that
[57:43] everyone must make
[57:46] if you accept your jubilee entonces
[57:50] then you can return to your family
[57:54] you can return back to your homeland
[57:57] and return back to your position
[58:01] you can return back of what adam had
[58:03] antis
[58:05] before the fall
[58:20] the bible declares that even our own
[58:22] selves
[58:25] we're kings and priests
[58:29] the bible also declares
[58:34] that the millenniums and the manilla
[58:35] will be kings and priests
[58:39] what is the king
[58:43] a king is someone who has dominion over
[58:45] something
[58:48] and the way that brother branham says
[58:51] we're now kings
[58:55] that we have dominion over the earth
[58:59] we have dominion over the evil spirits
[59:29] with our lord jesus christ we are our
[59:32] kings
[59:33] and priests
[59:44] just like and back when adam he was
[59:46] literally that
[59:47] dominion
[59:50] he had the meaning over the the animals
[59:52] and the animals over the earth
[59:56] but every day of in the evening time
[1:00:12] we can return back to our family
[1:00:16] we can return back to our homeland
[1:00:18] and to our position
[1:00:21] everything that adam had antis de la
[1:00:24] caida before the fall
[1:00:26] puerto rico
[1:00:51] i'm not sure if anybody's here i've
[1:00:52] heard when he makes reference to that
[1:00:54] boss
[1:01:08] there's a lot of redemption
[1:01:10] of the bride
[1:01:14] of the 144 000
[1:01:16] and of the land
[1:01:20] that's why if you study the story of
[1:01:22] ruth
[1:01:24] you find that boaz
[1:01:28] he redeemed ruth
[1:01:32] and the property that was lost
[1:01:36] what
[1:02:03] in the beginning
[1:02:07] he's returning us back to what was lost
[1:02:09] in the beginning
[1:02:12] that's what jubilee is to return back
[1:02:18] to return back to what belonged to you
[1:02:20] originally
[1:02:27] i would like to read this quote first
[1:02:30] the message water from the rock
[1:02:46] it was the bread of life that sustained
[1:02:48] them all the way through the journey
[1:02:52] and the day that they entered into the
[1:02:54] type el mileno the millennium
[1:02:59] over in the other promised land and on
[1:03:01] the airs podia
[1:03:02] nosotros where they could like we are
[1:03:05] vivid
[1:03:07] to live for a thousand years without
[1:03:09] death
[1:03:12] when they entered into the land
[1:03:28] heaven
[1:03:31] the day that we enter the millennium
[1:03:33] christo christ
[1:03:49] because christ will be there himself in
[1:03:51] forma
[1:03:53] and body form
[1:03:56] as king
[1:04:03] is going to beat their plowshares also
[1:04:06] of their crowning espadas and regards
[1:04:09] or swords into plowshares
[1:04:13] and war is over then
[1:04:17] going to have some rest around here
[1:04:21] the world is going to rejoice
[1:04:38] and
[1:04:53] he wants to take us out of the world
[1:04:57] and wants to take us to the baptism of
[1:04:59] the holy ghost
[1:05:03] but there is a land that he does want to
[1:05:04] share with us
[1:05:20] which is called the millennium
[1:05:22] millennial
[1:05:24] and the millennium is the year of
[1:05:25] jubilee
[1:05:28] because in the jubilee you can go back
[1:05:29] too
[1:05:33] the land of what they originally
[1:05:34] possessed
[1:05:37] now the quote that we just read
[1:05:42] in case if you don't know the scriptures
[1:05:48] is quoting a scripture at the very end
[1:05:54] it's talking about their plowshares
[1:05:55] they're crowning
[1:05:59] swords into plowshares
[1:06:13] and then the bible
[1:06:16] says and he shall judge among the
[1:06:19] nations and shall rebuke many people
[1:06:24] and they shall beat their swords into
[1:06:26] plowshares
[1:06:29] and their spears enter pounding hooks
[1:06:34] nations shall not lift up sword against
[1:06:36] nation
[1:06:39] neither shall they learn war anymore
[1:06:43] what does that mean
[1:07:12] before entering to the millennium
[1:07:16] in fact there's a war that the bible
[1:07:18] speaks about
[1:07:20] it's called armageddon
[1:07:24] so you have to see the story
[1:08:10] having control over the promised land
[1:08:14] he first had to be war after war
[1:08:18] to have a complete possession
[1:08:21] of that land foreign
[1:08:36] and that is jesus christ who is fighting
[1:08:41] he's going to fight to win over that
[1:08:42] land
[1:08:45] he's going to win the earth
[1:08:49] and it's going to return it back to its
[1:08:50] original condition
[1:08:54] which adam and eve had primed
[1:08:57] because the first adam had possession
[1:08:59] and he lost it
[1:09:02] but the second atom
[1:09:18] that position that satan took away from
[1:09:20] us
[1:09:22] that's why it says in isaiah 2 4.
[1:09:26] he says that the spears
[1:09:28] espada
[1:09:29] swords
[1:09:32] swords are something you
[1:09:48] to work
[1:09:51] because in the millennium there'll be no
[1:09:52] wars
[1:09:53] instruments
[1:09:56] so those those
[1:09:57] things that the instruments are used for
[1:09:59] war in
[1:10:12] he was the one who labored the earth
[1:10:27] convert those swords uh
[1:10:42] here's what brother bram says
[1:10:46] questions and answers number one
[1:10:50] this is a question that somebody asked
[1:10:51] for the branham
[1:11:09] it is not isaiah's meaning of the
[1:11:11] beating of the swords and the plowshares
[1:11:13] to come to pastor in the 1000 reign of
[1:11:15] christ rather than something that a man
[1:11:17] can bring as so many modern
[1:11:19] religiousness tells us
[1:11:23] ever who you are my
[1:11:24] brother who wrote it mia madormano
[1:11:26] hermana my dear brother or sister
[1:11:30] looks like a man's handwriting
[1:11:32] but anyhow whoever it may be
[1:11:36] you are exactly right
[1:11:44] that's when the plowshares well rather
[1:11:46] when the swords will beat into
[1:11:48] plowshares
[1:12:20] the story repeats itself
[1:12:27] if you see the bible
[1:12:30] you see how the bible runs in cycles
[1:12:34] because the word of god is eternal not
[1:12:36] in a principle it has no beginning nor
[1:12:38] end solo
[1:12:41] it just repeats itself once and once
[1:12:43] again
[1:12:48] it
[1:13:01] and god told them you could eat of any
[1:13:03] fruit the toddlers
[1:13:05] of all the trees
[1:13:07] except of one tree
[1:13:09] and we already know that
[1:13:11] millennium now the millennium there'll
[1:13:14] be no wars
[1:13:16] but we have to
[1:13:29] we're going to labor the earth
[1:13:33] we're going to eat the fruit of the
[1:13:34] earth
[1:13:38] like they didn't enter the promised land
[1:13:42] they had a manna fallen from heaven
[1:14:08] and the bible says and i believe it's in
[1:14:10] spanish
[1:14:23] of angels but we have received the
[1:14:25] seventh angel message
[1:14:38] we want to go back to the promised land
[1:14:54] they can feed the part of god that's
[1:14:55] within us
[1:14:57] but now in the millennium
[1:15:01] will have a different body
[1:15:04] you don't have to be fed from heaven
[1:15:08] will be fed from the same earth
[1:15:12] and isaiah 65.
[1:15:16] the 19th verse
[1:15:19] of millennium says this speaks of the
[1:15:21] millennium
[1:15:32] and the voice of weeping shall be no
[1:15:33] more heard than her they say
[1:16:19] there'll be something in the earth
[1:16:20] that's going to be able to feed us
[1:16:24] just like jesus christ when he
[1:16:25] resurrected
[1:16:30] he had the ability to travel any part of
[1:16:32] the earth yeah
[1:16:46] now the
[1:16:59] takes you to the baptism of the holy
[1:17:01] ghost
[1:17:03] takes you to the revelations of jesus
[1:17:05] christ
[1:17:07] takes you to the rapture
[1:17:10] takes you to the future
[1:17:12] and it takes you to the millennium
[1:17:41] what is the key of
[1:17:42] david philadelphia and the message the
[1:17:45] philadelphian church age
[1:17:49] organization
[1:17:53] not through any church any
[1:17:55] organization any bishop pope just
[1:17:56] through jesus christ
[1:17:59] he has the key
[1:18:02] he's the only one that can
[1:18:05] the keys of what david david el futuro
[1:18:08] millennium
[1:18:09] the future coming millennium
[1:18:14] he'll stand on the throne of david
[1:18:18] i have the keys of david
[1:18:21] i'll open this door
[1:18:24] and nobody can shut it
[1:18:27] nobody can open it but me
[1:18:30] and nobody can shut it to me
[1:18:34] the keys of david represent
[1:18:38] represents the throne that christ would
[1:18:40] have in the millennial in the millennium
[1:18:44] as son of david
[1:18:46] because david had a son
[1:18:48] in the natural
[1:18:50] salomon and it was solomon
[1:18:52] usted
[1:19:04] [Music]
[1:19:05] it was only but peace
[1:19:09] isaiah 22 22.
[1:19:13] it speaks about the same key
[1:19:19] and the key of the house of david lay
[1:19:21] upon his shoulder
[1:19:24] he shall open and none shall shut
[1:19:28] she shall shut and no one shall open
[1:19:33] that's very strange
[1:19:46] an exposition of the seven churches the
[1:19:48] philadelphian church age
[1:19:54] here david signified at that time as a
[1:19:56] mere shadow while sombra is completed in
[1:19:59] jesus which is now fulfilled in jesus
[1:20:02] christ
[1:20:16] earthly pilgrimage
[1:20:19] but what does this key signify
[1:20:23] the answer lies
[1:20:26] in the position of the king
[1:20:30] the key is
[1:20:58] and no man has the right but jesus
[1:21:00] himself
[1:21:02] isn't that right
[1:21:05] but where is the key is
[1:21:07] it is on his shoulder
[1:21:10] but what does that shoulder have to do
[1:21:12] with it
[1:21:21] he says
[1:21:22] isaiah 9 6. he says
[1:21:42] the phrase government upon his shoulder
[1:21:44] comes from the wedding ceremony of the
[1:21:45] east
[1:21:48] when the bride has been committed to the
[1:21:50] groom
[1:21:54] she takes off her veil and places it
[1:21:56] over the groom's shoulders
[1:22:01] signifying that not only is she under
[1:22:03] his dominion
[1:22:08] that she has transferred her rights to
[1:22:11] him
[1:22:14] that he is the head
[1:22:19] we have seen in wedding ceremonies
[1:22:21] when they get married
[1:22:24] that the bride places the veil upon the
[1:22:27] groom's shoulders
[1:22:31] that represents the responsibility the
[1:22:33] man is carrying foreign
[1:22:43] representing the responsibility of jesus
[1:22:45] christ
[1:22:47] that he's going to have in the
[1:22:49] millennium
[1:23:02] but also that he bears the
[1:23:04] responsibility
[1:23:18] has any right and responsibility
[1:23:24] and that beloved is the key of david
[1:23:27] the key of david
[1:23:30] was not david the king of israel all of
[1:23:33] israel
[1:23:36] and it's not jesus the son of david
[1:23:42] according to the fact that he'll be set
[1:23:44] upon the throne of david
[1:23:46] in the millennium
[1:24:08] [Music]
[1:24:17] that they may share in his reign of
[1:24:18] righteousness upon the earth
[1:24:23] now i want to take that scripture that
[1:24:24] my brother brandon mentioned and he said
[1:24:27] isaiah 9 6
[1:24:35] for unto us a child is born and unto us
[1:24:37] unto us as son is given and the
[1:24:39] government shall be upon his shoulders
[1:24:49] and his name shall be called wonderful
[1:24:51] counselor of the mighty god the
[1:24:52] everlasting father the prince of peace
[1:24:56] is
[1:25:11] but in spanish it says this principality
[1:25:15] now a principality is a territory it's a
[1:25:18] territory
[1:25:20] or a place
[1:25:23] that is given onto a prince
[1:25:37] because he has the key to that place
[1:25:53] of the increase of his government in the
[1:25:54] peace shall there be no end
[1:25:57] upon the throne of david
[1:26:00] and upon his kingdom
[1:26:04] to order it and to establish it with
[1:26:06] judgment and with justice
[1:26:10] from henceforth even to forever
[1:26:15] it says the seal of the lord
[1:26:17] of hosts will will perform this
[1:26:20] decay
[1:26:23] because before the
[1:26:25] the prince will reign his principality a
[1:26:27] peace
[1:26:29] there will be war
[1:26:31] but after the war is done
[1:26:33] milan
[1:26:34] there will be
[1:27:02] he won't be
[1:27:09] he said he will be tied down for those
[1:27:11] thousand years
[1:27:30] foreign
[1:27:37] that day there shall be a fountain
[1:27:38] opened to the house of david and on to
[1:27:40] the inhabitants of jerusalem for sin and
[1:27:42] for uncleanliness
[1:28:09] [Music]
[1:28:16] there's a fountain open the house of
[1:28:18] david berlin
[1:28:20] bethlehem
[1:28:23] it's bethlehem is the house of god's
[1:28:25] bread
[1:28:41] who warrior that can see the millennium
[1:28:43] coming
[1:28:46] what warrior can see this great holy
[1:28:48] spirit coming in
[1:28:50] to christ come in the form of jesus
[1:28:52] christ
[1:28:54] the literal
[1:29:07] talks about a fountain there in the
[1:29:08] house of david
[1:29:10] in the millennium which is christ in the
[1:29:12] millennials
[1:29:16] is going to purify the sin upon the
[1:29:18] earth
[1:29:19] and it says it's the warrior el espiritu
[1:29:22] the holy spirit informa del cuerpo de
[1:29:24] jesus christ
[1:29:26] in the form of the body of jesus christ
[1:29:28] doing this
[1:29:31] remember when joshua sent forth the
[1:29:33] spies
[1:29:35] and they returned back with the with the
[1:29:36] grapes
[1:29:39] with evidence
[1:29:41] of the promised land
[1:29:44] and then milk and honey flute uh flow
[1:29:46] through
[1:29:49] the day of pentecost
[1:30:21] and it shall come to pass in the day in
[1:30:22] the mountains thus drop down new wine
[1:30:24] and the hills shall flow with milk and
[1:30:26] the rivers of judah shall flow with
[1:30:28] waters and the fountains shall come
[1:30:29] forth out of the house of the lord and
[1:30:31] in the water of the valley asythm a
[1:30:32] system
[1:30:35] because in isaiah
[1:30:37] 65
[1:30:40] vineyards
[1:30:46] vineyards where they they grow or they
[1:30:47] have grapes
[1:30:50] in order to make wine
[1:30:53] they say they're going to have wine
[1:30:56] and milk is going to flow itamina
[1:31:00] there's going to be a fountain in the
[1:31:01] house of david
[1:31:04] if you noticed everything that we
[1:31:06] studied
[1:31:09] the scripture speaks about the
[1:31:10] millennium commons
[1:31:14] i will have wine and milk there vamos a
[1:31:16] comparable
[1:31:18] we're going to eat there's going to be
[1:31:19] something upon the earth
[1:31:21] that's going to be able to feed us
[1:31:25] we're not going to be able to feed us
[1:31:26] from heaven anymore
[1:31:29] now the earth itself will have the
[1:31:31] ability
[1:31:34] to feed the body that god gave us
[1:31:39] like we mentioned times past
[1:31:41] antis
[1:31:53] between lucifer and miguel and michael
[1:31:56] miguel
[1:32:11] there has been many signposts that
[1:32:12] pointed to that day muchos grandest many
[1:32:16] great foreshadows
[1:32:19] has been foreshadowed by the lamb
[1:32:22] by the bullock
[1:32:24] by the turtle
[1:33:32] lucifer came to the earth
[1:33:48] that he walked upon the earth
[1:33:51] that he left his footprints
[1:33:55] he says in ezekiel 28.
[1:33:58] in verse 13.
[1:34:02] that has been in the garden of eden of
[1:34:04] god
[1:34:07] every precious stone was thy covering
[1:34:15] esmeralda
[1:34:18] the sardis topaz the diamond the barrel
[1:34:21] the onyx and the jasper in the sapphire
[1:34:23] the emerald and the carbonicle and gold
[1:34:31] the workmanship of thy tablets of thy
[1:34:33] pipes were prepared to envy in the day
[1:34:35] that i was created
[1:34:39] thou art anointed
[1:34:40] covereth
[1:34:44] i have said and i have said the soul
[1:34:46] that was upon the holy mountain of god
[1:34:55] thou has walked up and down the midst of
[1:34:57] the stones of fire
[1:35:01] so satan in some manner
[1:35:07] was able to walk over the volcanic ash
[1:35:10] marco la position and he murked the
[1:35:13] position
[1:35:17] in the future
[1:35:20] that's why it says here
[1:35:24] and malachi 4.
[1:35:26] what the ram
[1:35:36] the heavens and earth will be on fire
[1:35:38] and burned with bourbon heat and
[1:35:57] the righteous shall walk upon the ashes
[1:36:00] volcanicas de los mars the volcanic
[1:36:03] ashes of the wicked in
[1:36:05] millennia in the millennium
[1:36:08] which is lomismo
[1:36:23] with the same with the same coin
[1:36:28] the same thing the devil does to the
[1:36:29] children of god
[1:36:32] god does it to the devil
[1:36:36] and lucifer
[1:36:49] over the volcanic ashes
[1:36:52] represents possession now footprints
[1:36:55] means position or possessions
[1:37:01] remember god told them where your where
[1:37:03] your feet shall trod and don't
[1:37:17] that he will take over
[1:37:40] [Music]
[1:38:28] it won't be just
[1:39:52] with footprints of faith
[1:39:56] now that's our the theme of our camp
[1:40:00] walk with god
[1:40:03] now we're walking by faith now
[1:40:06] literally
[1:40:20] even
[1:40:22] and wherever your feet shall trod
[1:40:27] marking the promise that belongs to you
[1:40:32] now malachi 4 says
[1:41:08] and here brother branham says in the
[1:41:11] message a true sign that's overlooked
[1:41:16] unto
[1:41:20] shall the sun of righteousness rise
[1:41:24] with healing in his wings vosotros
[1:41:27] you shall go forth
[1:41:30] and you shall grow up
[1:41:33] as call calves in the stall
[1:41:36] that's the millennium
[1:41:39] they're having a jubilee
[1:41:42] they're very happy
[1:41:58] communion
[1:42:12] it says that's the millennium aura
[1:42:17] i would like to read in the message
[1:42:18] questions and answers
[1:42:22] paragraph 172
[1:42:25] now watch malachi 4.
[1:42:55] destruction that's of the tribulation
[1:42:57] and destruction
[1:42:59] see that's coming
[1:43:02] but unto you that fear my name
[1:43:06] shall the son of righteousness rise
[1:43:18] you should go forth go go forth and grow
[1:43:20] up as cows of the stall como
[1:43:22] de la
[1:43:36] that brother branham gives
[1:43:51] you
[1:43:52] and in my mind i thought
[1:43:55] he was able to explain it a bit more
[1:43:59] he was very brief
[1:44:02] but that's all that you need
[1:44:22] then jesus said unto him again verily
[1:44:24] verily i say unto you i am the door to
[1:44:26] the sheep
[1:44:29] i am the door bye if any man enter in
[1:44:44] that's the interpretation that brother
[1:44:46] branham gave
[1:45:08] the exposition of the seven church ages
[1:45:10] affiliate of the philadelphian church
[1:45:12] age
[1:45:14] in san juan
[1:45:28] door
[1:45:32] and that is the shepherd to the sheep
[1:45:35] he is actually their door
[1:45:39] when i was over in the east
[1:45:42] i
[1:46:04] he will lie down in the open door of the
[1:46:06] fold
[1:46:09] and literally became the door of the
[1:46:11] fold
[1:46:17] no one could get in or out except by him
[1:46:21] he was the door jesus
[1:47:06] sound
[1:47:09] distinction and this trumpet would make
[1:47:11] the the distinction
[1:47:15] or the trumpet was the 50th year sound
[1:47:20] every slave
[1:47:48] for he was too poor to redeem himself
[1:47:53] that's why jesus christ is our kinsmen
[1:47:55] redeemer
[1:47:58] because we don't have the ability
[1:48:01] to redeem our own selves
[1:48:18] but our kinsmen redeemer
[1:48:21] he is the king of kings
[1:48:24] he is the the owner
[1:48:27] of the horse
[1:48:29] we don't have the ability
[1:48:32] because we're poor but
[1:48:33] rico but he is rich
[1:48:37] and he does have the ability to take us
[1:48:39] to that
[1:48:41] but god said
[1:48:43] remember
[1:48:57] therefore at the sounding of the trumpet
[1:49:00] today
[1:49:01] every slave no importa
[1:49:05] no matter how long he's been in
[1:49:07] poco oh how short of a time
[1:49:12] he has a liberty to return to his family
[1:49:16] and to return to his people
[1:49:19] and be free of every depth
[1:49:22] for the time of jubilee inclusive
[1:49:27] and even you wasn't to plant any corn
[1:49:31] produce what the field produced
[1:49:34] you was to live on it
[1:49:38] you shouldn't trim your vineyard
[1:49:40] or anything
[1:50:23] sin
[1:50:25] you can go home and be free
[1:50:27] with us you don't owe any depths at all
[1:50:35] the whole emancipation of proclamation
[1:50:37] is done
[1:50:39] it's signed and you are free
[1:50:43] and today when a man hears the good news
[1:50:48] christ died in your stead
[1:51:46] only the bread that falls from heaven
[1:51:49] we have the bread
[1:51:51] of the seventh messenger
[1:51:53] to feed us
[1:51:57] but one day that bread is going to take
[1:51:59] us to the next place
[1:52:29] tonight
[1:52:31] that would teach you like this
[1:52:34] that wouldn't make any difference my
[1:52:35] brother
[1:52:36] or sister
[1:52:38] whatever it is
[1:52:42] i may be wrong in my theories of it
[1:52:49] but i couldn't i i could never could
[1:52:51] liken the promised land onto like being
[1:52:53] on to heaven
[1:52:57] because they had wars in the promised
[1:52:59] land
[1:53:00] of the millennium i'm a believer in the
[1:53:02] millennium
[1:53:04] millennium i believe that there will be
[1:53:06] a millennium milan
[1:53:08] a thousand years on earth
[1:53:21] and i believe that the promised land
[1:53:22] represented the millennium los milanos
[1:53:30] and if you notice as soon as they cross
[1:53:31] jordan significa
[1:53:33] which means separation
[1:53:37] from this earthly journey
[1:53:50] and they eat of the old corn
[1:54:19] and the bible said we will build houses
[1:54:24] plant vineyards
[1:54:27] plant vineyards and eat the fruit of
[1:54:29] them
[1:54:32] when we come into the millennium
[1:54:43] as sicknesses and death flee from the
[1:54:45] world
[1:54:48] where we're
[1:55:01] we're waiting for a future jubilee
[1:55:14] make sure you have your jubilee now
[1:55:43] we give you thanks lord for your
[1:55:44] revealed
[1:55:57] that is our instructions
[1:56:01] that prepares us to go into that land
[1:56:03] yes
[1:56:05] that is to have faith in god
[1:56:09] we are walking by faith
[1:56:12] but one day
[1:56:15] [Music]
[1:56:29] name of the lord jesus christ amen amen
[1:56:33] [Applause]
[1:56:36] [Music]
[1:56:37] [Applause]
[1:56:38] [Music]
[1:56:52] amen my god

[1:57:25] [Music]
