[21:01] the
[21:03] glory if You' like to turn with
[21:06] me to
[21:08] Philippians pH chapter 4 verse 6 and
[21:14] [Music]
[21:16] 7 I I have just a little thought this
[21:21] evening if God willing I won't be
[21:23] keeping you too
[21:26] long the Bible it
[21:29] says be careful for nothing but in
[21:33] everything by prayer and supplication
[21:36] with Thanksgiving let your requests be
[21:38] made known unto
[21:49] God and the peace of God the peace of
[21:54] God which passeth all understanding
[21:57] shall keep your hearts and Minds through
[22:00] Christ
[22:10] Jesus let us bow our
[22:13] heads oh Heavenly
[22:16] Father what a privilege it is to be here
[22:19] in your presence once more
[22:24] father Lord that we can come and make
[22:27] you the sent center of our
[22:33] life Lord we come here with expectation
[22:38] father from the beginning to the end of
[22:40] the
[22:43] service knowing that father we are not
[22:46] Conjuring up any emotion or trying to
[22:48] bring anything up
[22:55] father but we're here to meet a
[22:57] supernatural
[23:01] being we're here to meet our God our
[23:04] living Jesus
[23:09] Christ and my prayer is
[23:13] Lord that you make yourself known to
[23:15] your
[23:17] people that you may just give a spirit
[23:21] of Faith within each and every person
[23:25] Lord that we may leave here father is
[23:31] stronger though the world is falling
[23:33] into pieces
[23:37] Lord father we can stand on that
[23:41] rock we can stand in your
[23:44] word in the name of the Lord Jesus
[23:46] Christ we ask all these
[23:50] things Lord have the
[23:53] preeminence name of Jesus Christ we
[23:57] pray am amen and amen amen amen amen you
[24:00] may be seated
[24:04] am so Philippians 4 6 and
[24:10] 7 he says be careful for
[24:16] nothing be careful for
[24:20] nothing that means don't worry for
[24:27] everything or be anxious for
[24:32] nothing because the peace of
[24:35] God see there's many peace out
[24:39] there many people are looking for peace
[24:42] in the
[24:44] world but this
[24:46] peace is a peace of
[24:49] God that passes all
[24:54] understanding that we don't understand
[24:56] this piece
[24:59] see worries they come up in our
[25:03] lives we're all prone to be
[25:10] worriers we're all prone to have
[25:13] problems in
[25:16] life to where we can't help but to
[25:21] worry but here Paul is telling
[25:24] us he says do not be in a perpetual
[25:28] state of worry or
[25:34] anxiety see we
[25:36] worry we'll worry about the bills one
[25:40] day we'll worry about our children the
[25:44] next but where the devil wants to keep
[25:48] us
[25:50] at is in a state of
[25:54] anxiety where we don't
[25:57] allow the Holy Spirit to
[26:01] move that's that's where the devil wants
[26:04] the world
[26:07] today see see the Bible says that there
[26:09] is a time for everything
[26:13] Brothers there's there is a time to be
[26:16] happy there's a time for
[26:19] war there's a time to be sad believe it
[26:23] or
[26:25] not I'm sure there's a time to worry too
[26:31] I'm sure there's a time to be concerned
[26:33] about
[26:38] things but where the devil gets us
[26:43] at is is whenever we we don't allow that
[26:47] time to
[26:51] stop because every time it has an end to
[26:54] that
[26:57] time but but if we allow sadness to
[27:01] continue on in our
[27:06] lives if we allow mourning over a loved
[27:09] one continue in our
[27:16] lives it becomes
[27:20] depression see we we're all sad we all
[27:23] get
[27:25] sad we're all worried about certain
[27:29] things but if the devil can continue or
[27:33] or allow us to continue in
[27:37] that that's when the the spirits come
[27:40] upon
[27:43] us and and a body full of
[27:47] worry brother bam says it's the Avenue
[27:50] of
[27:52] sickness brother brandham most of his
[27:55] prayer lines
[27:57] Brothers
[28:00] I'm not sure I asked brother Emanuel in
[28:02] the
[28:05] back but brother Brandon preached over a
[28:07] thousand over 1100
[28:12] messages and in those 1100
[28:17] messages in those prayer
[28:20] lines over 1700
[28:23] [Music]
[28:25] times brother brandham would would
[28:28] discern
[28:30] somebody and and he would say yeah yeah
[28:32] you have a a heart
[28:36] problem Oh you you have ulcers in your
[28:40] stomach oh you you have back
[28:43] pain but but what's causing
[28:48] this is your nervous
[28:52] condition it it it was their
[28:56] nervousness causing their body
[29:00] to get into a state of
[29:03] sickness brother bam says that this
[29:05] whole world is plagued with
[29:10] that well nobody
[29:13] nobody absolutely
[29:16] nobody is saved from
[29:19] this brother Bram says we're living in a
[29:22] neurotic
[29:25] age where there's nervous tension all
[29:31] around brother Bram he he tells a story
[29:34] of this little a little lamb
[29:39] once he was there in Africa looking at
[29:42] his
[29:45] binoculars and and he saw a little sheep
[29:48] leave the
[29:52] Corral and as that sheep began to go out
[29:55] into the
[29:57] field
[29:59] over there in the field it has long
[30:01] yellow
[30:06] grass that that little sheep begin to
[30:08] get a little
[30:11] nervous see in that sheep something
[30:14] began to
[30:17] happen inside of that sheep a
[30:20] nervousness came
[30:24] up and and he begin he begin to scream
[30:27] out that little sh
[30:32] and brother Bram says why is this sheep
[30:34] so
[30:38] nervous even the the little lamb the
[30:40] little sheep didn't even know why it was
[30:45] nervous and brother Bram said it was
[30:48] because there was a great big yellow man
[30:54] lion behind those that that grass
[30:59] and and he didn't know it was behind
[31:02] him he just sensed that something was
[31:07] wrong he knew something something was
[31:10] about to take
[31:13] place and and brothers that brother Bram
[31:16] says that is the condition of the world
[31:21] today the the world doesn't know what to
[31:26] do because of these Eclipse that
[31:30] happened you see in the news how people
[31:32] are buying this and buying
[31:36] that running around
[31:40] nervous why because something is fixing
[31:43] to happen brother brandham
[31:48] says the world is just built up in
[31:53] pressure it's built up upon pressure
[31:56] brother Bram says
[31:59] he said and it's going to blow up one of
[32:01] these
[32:03] days the world is built full of
[32:08] pressure and the doctors don't know what
[32:11] to do about
[32:14] it the psychiatrist has got uh
[32:17] psychiatrist doctoring
[32:21] them that's right they don't have the
[32:26] answer but God does
[32:29] God has the answer to all of
[32:33] this see the world is built up in
[32:39] pressure the
[32:42] outside your your outside uh
[32:48] environment it's building up in
[32:51] pressure whether it's your
[32:53] work whether it's it's in your family
[32:56] life
[32:58] wherever it might be there's pressure
[33:04] everywhere and and because of that just
[33:07] like the little
[33:10] sheep just BEC because there's an
[33:12] outside presence or an outside
[33:18] pressure it causes a nervousness
[33:23] inside it causes anxiety inside of our
[33:27] lives
[33:30] so so we're all all of
[33:32] us we're in this little pressurized
[33:35] bubble called the
[33:39] world and we're all subject to some sort
[33:42] of worry or
[33:47] anxiety brother brandham said each age
[33:50] had its
[33:52] pressures he said for
[33:55] example the great burden of this last
[34:00] age is the pressure of
[34:04] riches soft
[34:07] living nervous
[34:10] tensions in a complex
[34:13] age that we seem unfit to live
[34:18] in so that that's the pressure for this
[34:23] age and a few years that a few years
[34:26] ago
[34:28] they they made a study concerning
[34:29] married
[34:32] men and the study it it revealed or the
[34:35] conclusion
[34:39] was that the number one worry or stress
[34:43] in the married
[34:47] man in
[34:49] America was
[34:52] money that that one little
[34:56] thing it'll stress and put stress over
[35:00] every single man
[35:03] here why because the very time they say
[35:06] I do in the
[35:10] altar that it puts a a charge or a
[35:13] burden on
[35:17] them to where how am I going to have the
[35:24] ability to care or provide for my family
[35:30] and and and there's going there's
[35:31] pressures everywhere every single person
[35:34] has an anxiety of
[35:39] something and that's the one of the
[35:42] that's the devil's attack or his
[35:44] greatest attack on the
[35:49] Christian it's it's not trying to get
[35:52] you to smoke or drink or do all those
[35:54] other
[35:56] things
[35:58] brother we're past
[36:01] that we're past those
[36:04] things trying us to get to disbelieve
[36:07] the the word or or or the message or
[36:09] something like
[36:12] that but the way he he tries us tries to
[36:16] get us to
[36:20] disbelieve he will attack us on fear and
[36:26] worry he will we he will put an anxiety
[36:29] over a
[36:32] Christian in 2 Timothy 1:7 it
[36:36] says for God hath not given us the
[36:40] spirit of
[36:44] fear God has not given us the spirit of
[36:51] fear but of
[36:54] power love and A sound
[37:00] mind he did not give us a
[37:04] spirit he gives us his holy
[37:07] spirit but but but rest assured
[37:12] brothers that Spirit isn't just or I
[37:15] mean uh fear isn't just an
[37:20] emotion but it's a
[37:23] spirit God did not give us that
[37:26] spirit but the devil
[37:29] does he'll give us that spirit of
[37:33] fear he'll he'll do that so that it
[37:36] because it combats or or it attacks our
[37:43] faith fear is the
[37:46] devil and it's the enemy to our
[37:49] faith it directly contradicts the
[37:54] word brother brandham says in the in
[37:57] perfect
[37:59] Faith now now he's going to talk about
[38:05] job job was a perfect
[38:07] man there there was nothing that you
[38:10] could put on job and say he's wrong on
[38:16] this but but brother Bram says
[38:20] this he says in the Book of
[38:23] Job it says here job
[38:28] feared and what what he
[38:32] feared actually
[38:35] happened what brought
[38:37] it what brought the thing that actually
[38:42] happened his
[38:44] fear that's what made it
[38:48] happen his
[38:50] faith would have kept him from
[38:54] it but his fear brought him him brought
[38:58] it to
[39:00] him he was scared it was going to
[39:04] happen and it did
[39:07] happen now if he know it wouldn't happen
[39:10] or it it wouldn't
[39:13] happen see what I
[39:16] mean so his his own
[39:20] fear his own
[39:23] worry his own
[39:26] anxiety was the one thing that brought
[39:29] the thing he was scared of to
[39:35] pass and and that fear it's caused by
[39:38] the
[39:43] belief the
[39:45] expectation the
[39:48] anticipation of that something is bad is
[39:51] going to
[39:53] happen it's the negative of faith
[39:58] see I've always when I would hear that
[40:02] quote I'd hear Brother Bron say
[40:06] this and I understood that the devil he
[40:09] is powerless without
[40:14] us he can't do nothing without
[40:17] you he he's just a fly on the
[40:22] wall but if if he can allow you to use
[40:26] your own faith against the
[40:31] word then he will allow you or cause
[40:38] you to create things that are negative
[40:41] in your
[40:44] life by our own
[40:47] faith by our own
[40:50] worry fear and faith are the
[40:55] Opposites it's the an anticipation that
[40:58] something horrible is going to
[41:02] happen there was there was one time when
[41:05] the the disciples and Jesus were on the
[41:11] ship and brother brandham says that
[41:14] Devils were on each side in those
[41:20] waves he was going to turn that boat
[41:25] over he was going to try to eliminate
[41:28] those
[41:30] people and and and the disciples were so
[41:34] scared so fearful of their
[41:40] lives that that's how we are sometimes
[41:42] in our
[41:45] lives when storms
[41:48] happen when troubles happen in our
[41:51] lives we're so
[41:55] afraid of what is to come
[41:59] we're so afraid of something that is not
[42:01] even
[42:04] real it hasn't even taken place
[42:09] yet see fear is and worry and
[42:15] anxiety is all future
[42:19] problems they're all tomorrow problems
[42:22] that we're worrying
[42:26] about
[42:27] but the devil will say yes this is the
[42:29] greatest problem that you're ever going
[42:31] to
[42:35] face and maybe it
[42:37] is and maybe maybe we'll die
[42:42] tomorrow but Brothers Jesus was in the
[42:47] ship Jesus was in that
[42:51] ship the Bible brother Bram says a ship
[42:55] means
[42:56] Fellowship
[43:01] two men in one
[43:04] ship and brother if you have Christ in
[43:07] your
[43:09] heart if you have Christ in your
[43:12] life why
[43:15] worry why
[43:17] worry the the the one that will cause
[43:20] the sea to stop is here
[43:25] Brothers Let's the storm robot
[43:29] let the things
[43:30] happen as long as Jesus is in the
[43:34] ship that's all we care
[43:37] about that's all that matters to me
[43:42] personally where is
[43:45] Jesus they were so scared they woke him
[43:49] up they said Lord Lord we're about to
[43:52] die and you don't even
[43:56] care he probably wiped the tears off of
[43:59] his eyes as he barely woke
[44:04] up he got in the the Helm of the
[44:09] ship and he said peace be
[44:12] still and as easy as that
[44:16] was he he didn't have to get worked up
[44:19] in a Pentecostal uh spirit
[44:24] Brothers he didn't have to yell and yell
[44:26] and yell at that
[44:30] water he said peace be
[44:33] still and that se knew who its maker
[44:39] was and he turned to his beloved
[44:44] disciples and he said why are you afraid
[44:47] why are you so
[44:51] fearful I believe God would ask us the
[44:54] same thing
[44:59] as as the whole world as our world is C
[45:03] crumbling around
[45:08] us why are you so
[45:11] fearful and he right after he says that
[45:15] why are you so
[45:19] fearful he says H how is it that you
[45:22] have no
[45:25] faith see he used both of them right
[45:29] together in the same
[45:33] sentence because fear is the absence of
[45:39] Faith fear is saying Lord I I Love You
[45:44] Lord but I don't know if you can do
[45:48] it I don't know if you're
[45:51] capable of taking over this
[45:55] situation
[45:57] and he's saying why are you so
[46:03] fearful I believe it's in Matthew or
[46:07] Luke he says oh ye of little
[46:11] faith our anxiety is the lack of trust
[46:15] in God and that that he is under
[46:22] control that he is has everything under
[46:25] control
[46:28] me as a child I know we could all
[46:30] testify of
[46:34] this but my father he had this blue
[46:40] van we weren't the richest in in the
[46:44] block we weren't the richest in the
[46:47] church so he had he had this blue van
[46:51] that he he would get all five of us kids
[46:54] and we would go from Phoenix to
[46:57] Texas wherever they wanted to
[47:06] go and yes there was times that we'd
[47:08] break down in the middle of
[47:14] nowhere and I'm sure my father he was
[47:19] stressed I'm sure he was trying to
[47:21] figure out every which way to get this
[47:25] going
[47:30] at that time we didn't have cell
[47:32] phones we we were just waiting for a a
[47:35] good pedestrian to stop and and help us
[47:42] out but brother did that bother
[47:47] me I was in the back playing with my
[47:51] toys I was in the back getting hungry
[47:54] saying I'm
[47:55] hungry
[47:59] I I was thinking okay this is a time for
[48:02] us to rest our feet and and play around
[48:04] in the
[48:10] side this is not my
[48:13] problem that sounds like dad's
[48:16] problem because it's it's a dad kind of
[48:22] problem and and I think to
[48:25] myself
[48:27] stop meddling with dad's
[48:31] problems I have to tell myself every
[48:33] once in a
[48:35] while stop meddling with Father's
[48:41] problems the things that I can't control
[48:43] in my
[48:45] life the things that that I I have no
[48:48] control to to fix or or to make it
[48:55] worse
[48:57] it's a god kind of
[49:01] problem it reminds me of Whenever there
[49:04] was that the child with his father in in
[49:07] Egypt or in
[49:11] Goan and the word of the Lord went forth
[49:14] to the
[49:17] land and and it said that the death
[49:19] angel would come and strike the
[49:25] land and kill every firstborn in that
[49:30] land but God gave the children of Israel
[49:34] a
[49:36] promise Brothers there's going to be
[49:38] trials there's going to be death Angels
[49:40] coming our
[49:45] way but God always gives us a
[49:50] promise God always gives us a way
[49:55] out God gave them away and and said put
[49:57] the blood on the lentil of the
[50:03] door and the father that's what he did
[50:09] faithfully and the son he began to hear
[50:12] the screams on the other
[50:17] side and he said dad do you love
[50:21] me yeah I love you
[50:23] son well am I not your first boy
[50:29] yes you are my
[50:31] firstborn he says look there
[50:35] dad the angel he got that little boy
[50:40] there I know
[50:43] him I played with him Oh Daddy here he
[50:48] comes
[50:51] says here he comes towards the
[50:55] house he says but son do you see that
[50:58] door post right
[51:01] there do you see that blood on that door
[51:07] post he said Daddy will will he get me
[51:10] will the angel get
[51:15] me he said no he can't get
[51:19] you why because God gave us a
[51:23] promise the death angel the problem the
[51:27] things they can't get
[51:31] us why father has gotten toen care of
[51:35] all the
[51:38] things no wonder the psalm psalmist
[51:40] David
[51:43] says though I walk through the valley of
[51:45] the shadow of
[51:48] death I fear no
[51:52] evil why don't I
[51:54] fear why cuz I'm big and
[51:58] strong why because I'll take it over
[52:02] myself no because thou art with me
[52:08] Lord thy rod and thy staff they come for
[52:13] me brother I need to stop meddling with
[52:17] father's
[52:21] business the the most uh command the the
[52:24] the Commandment that Jesus said the
[52:29] most as I'm
[52:31] closing he says it wasn't do not
[52:36] steal he he he said do not do this or do
[52:41] not do
[52:43] that he said do not be
[52:47] afraid and that
[52:50] commandment is the the Commandment most
[52:54] often looked at in the Bible
[53:00] do not be
[53:02] afraid there's a reason why that that
[53:05] commandment is is the most out of
[53:12] everyone because we're prone to be
[53:17] afraid we're prone to have fears and
[53:22] problems and this is not going to take
[53:24] away your issues out there
[53:29] in John
[53:32] 14:27 Jesus says now now this is this is
[53:37] right before Jesus gives his life on the
[53:43] cross this man that has all the world in
[53:46] his
[53:49] shoulders he has my sins and he has your
[53:53] sins he has my worries he has my
[53:56] problems
[53:59] yet he could still
[54:02] say peace I leave with
[54:06] you peace I leave with
[54:10] you my peace my
[54:14] peace I give unto
[54:17] you not as the world give
[54:21] it I give it to
[54:24] you let your heart not be
[54:28] troubled neither Let It Be
[54:32] Afraid my coworker he wants asked
[54:37] me he said if you could do anything to
[54:40] help this world out if you had the power
[54:42] to do
[54:46] it what would you
[54:48] do now that this very silly
[54:52] question I asked him what would you do
[54:57] he said I would create world
[55:04] peace I said how would you do that
[55:08] exactly well I would I would fix this
[55:12] with the police and that and and and all
[55:14] the wars I would get all the presidents
[55:22] together I would do this and I would do
[55:24] that and I would fix the park and I
[55:26] would do
[55:31] this Brothers the source of
[55:37] war the source of
[55:42] turmoil it's not going to be fixed
[55:47] outwardly it's not going to be fixed by
[55:49] by fixing the
[55:53] roads it's not going to be fixed by by
[55:56] running away from our
[55:59] problems it's not going to be fixed by
[56:02] going here and going
[56:05] there peace starts
[56:10] here you want world
[56:13] peace peace starts in
[56:17] here he says peace I give unto
[56:21] thee not as the world gives
[56:25] it see the world will try to give you
[56:30] peace but let me tell you
[56:32] what let me burst that
[56:36] bubble it's going to build more pressure
[56:39] in your
[56:41] life the drinking the smoking all of
[56:44] those
[56:47] things it creates more unstableness in
[56:50] our
[56:53] lives so how would Christ give us
[56:58] peace well not as the world gives
[57:02] it because the world they'll give you
[57:06] peace but it will be taken
[57:10] away once a little trial comes
[57:14] up once you wake up in the morning all
[57:16] of those issues are back with
[57:22] you he says let not your heart be
[57:28] trouble that's where our peace is at and
[57:31] founded
[57:34] at it starts in
[57:37] here where where no matter if the
[57:40] situation
[57:43] continues if if everything breaks around
[57:48] you nobody wants to talk to one
[57:53] another your family is in shambles
[57:58] you don't know how you're going to pay
[57:59] the bill next
[58:02] month you don't know how how you're
[58:04] going to do this or your what's going to
[58:06] happen
[58:09] here brother it's going to be there
[58:13] tomorrow this peace is not to fix all
[58:16] those
[58:19] things this piece isn't to fix
[58:23] whatever this piece is to give give you
[58:26] a quiet and a sound
[58:32] heart that you can
[58:35] understand though I am in
[58:39] Tribulation though I am in
[58:42] Trials though I don't feel
[58:45] good Lord thou art with me
[58:49] Lord Lord you are with me no matter
[58:54] what God is with
[58:57] us that is the source of our
[59:01] peace that is the reason why I'm a
[59:04] Christian
[59:06] today can't you say Amen to
[59:09] that why are you a
[59:12] Christian why do you come to
[59:14] church why do you want to serve
[59:17] him it's because
[59:20] him it's because when everybody is
[59:25] around
[59:26] or when nobody's
[59:29] watching he is with me no matter
[59:32] what where whether there's good days and
[59:35] bad days I have peace in my
[59:40] life let us stand to our feet
[59:43] brother brother brandham he says as the
[59:46] musicians come
[59:49] up he says now my poor dejected
[59:55] friend
[59:57] he says if you are here and don't know
[1:00:03] that I'm a witness that that's the
[1:00:08] truth I'm now this is Brother brandham
[1:00:14] here brother brandham he he wasn't he he
[1:00:17] wasn't uh protected from all of these
[1:00:23] things he went through exactly what we
[1:00:26] gone
[1:00:29] through and Jesus specially went through
[1:00:32] what we went
[1:00:35] through brother brandham he says I'm a
[1:00:38] nervous and upset
[1:00:43] person Irish on both
[1:00:47] sides and they're nervous and
[1:00:51] drunk my mother is a half
[1:00:54] Indian would would which would actually
[1:00:57] um by birth make me a
[1:01:03] renegade he said that's right oh I'd be
[1:01:06] a terrible
[1:01:10] person if it wasn't for the Lord where
[1:01:13] would we be
[1:01:15] at in this same message he carth for
[1:01:21] you he said if I wasn't a Christian
[1:01:27] he said I'd be a suicide
[1:01:31] case the prophet of the hour saying
[1:01:35] that but he's not a prophet just because
[1:01:38] he's he's William Mary and
[1:01:42] brandom but he needed Christ in his
[1:01:46] life to activate every
[1:01:50] gift Brothers if we didn't have Christ
[1:01:53] in our lives where would we be at
[1:01:58] we would be faking a good happy life
[1:02:00] somewhere maybe drinking in a club or
[1:02:07] something maybe we' be living a more
[1:02:09] righteous life than Christians
[1:02:14] do but without Christ we're poor and
[1:02:20] miserable he says oh I'd be a terrible
[1:02:24] person
[1:02:26] but what
[1:02:28] happened I found something that took the
[1:02:32] little room in
[1:02:36] me to to give peace that passes all
[1:02:43] understanding and I've come from Death
[1:02:45] unto
