[34:40] musicians thank you very
[34:45] much uh these two scriptures they're
[34:49] um kind of
[34:53] different but my my title this this
[34:59] evening is uh watch the end and keep
[35:06] steady now now don't worry I'm not I'm
[35:08] not going to be talking about what's
[35:10] going on with Hamas and
[35:15] Israel it's a very very simple
[35:19] message I and I I just want to talk
[35:21] usually I I get too excited
[35:25] sometimes
[35:29] but I just want to have a talk and um
[35:31] this is geared of course to the
[35:37] youth but knowing that it's it's going
[35:39] to help each and every person
[35:43] here um the the reason I I got this
[35:49] title was from a message that brother
[35:52] brandham
[35:54] preached it was called uh discern of the
[35:59] spirit preached in
[36:02] 1960 brother brandham he talks about how
[36:07] there was a
[36:10] town there was a town that was holding
[36:13] this little competition for for the
[36:15] young
[36:18] kids they wanted all the bike riders to
[36:21] to go over
[36:25] there because they had this little
[36:29] plank that was 12 in
[36:33] long and it it was a few feet um it was
[36:37] it was a few feet
[36:42] long and they wanted all the kids to
[36:44] ride over
[36:48] it so all the best bicyclist all the
[36:52] best um kids that knew how to um ride
[36:55] their bikes
[37:00] they all went to that
[37:03] competition because if they can get from
[37:05] one side of the plank to the
[37:10] other then they can win uh a
[37:14] bicycle and it was one of the the newest
[37:17] nice I think they were called Schwin
[37:19] bicycles back
[37:25] then brother brandham says that all the
[37:28] greatest um kids that knew how to ride
[37:30] their bikes were
[37:35] there the ones that could ride their
[37:37] bike without holding the Hanah
[37:43] bars all the ones that could do the
[37:47] tricks they they all went to that
[37:51] competition and so one by one they
[37:55] went and they all fell off of the
[38:00] plank and brother bham said that there
[38:02] was this little old
[38:07] boy brother called him a mama's
[38:12] boy he he he wasn't like like um the
[38:15] other
[38:18] children but but he went and he saw how
[38:21] everybody failed and how they
[38:25] fell
[38:27] and he got on his
[38:29] bike and he began to
[38:32] ride and he went from the beginning all
[38:35] the way to the
[38:38] end and all of the kids they were
[38:41] surrounded him and and they asked
[38:45] him how how did you make
[38:48] it how did you make it all the way to
[38:51] the end without
[38:53] falling now brother bham says this in
[38:56] the message
[38:58] Mage he says uh let's
[39:04] see he says um well okay well then he
[39:08] told him he's like well I watched every
[39:10] single one of
[39:13] you and I saw that you guys were looking
[39:16] at the the bicycle
[39:21] wheels I I saw how close you're getting
[39:24] to the to the edge
[39:29] and you were keeping an eye on what you
[39:30] were
[39:31] [Music]
[39:34] doing but he said all I
[39:37] did he said I kept my eyes to the
[39:42] end and I kept
[39:45] steady brother bam says that's what
[39:47] we're to
[39:50] do don't look at these little things
[39:54] now did this one do this or that one do
[40:00] that he says watch the end and keep
[40:07] steady Christ is
[40:09] coming watch the
[40:12] end just keep
[40:15] steady don't go don't notice what's
[40:18] going on
[40:21] now watch what's going on out yonder at
[40:24] the end time
[40:29] when we're going to have to stand and
[40:31] give an account for our
[40:37] lives brother that reminded me of of
[40:39] Peter whenever he started drowning
[40:41] because he saw all the
[40:47] waves he had he had the courage to step
[40:50] out of the
[40:53] boat he had the courage to accept accept
[40:56] Christ's um
[41:00] word when Christ said come to
[41:04] me and he went and he began to step into
[41:11] Miracles that's what Christians
[41:14] do every single day is a miracle for
[41:18] you you guys step into from Miracle to
[41:21] Miracle to
[41:25] miracle
[41:26] every step was on that
[41:31] water but because how how bad the waves
[41:37] were brother Bram already
[41:40] said that those were demon possessed
[41:45] waves so when he began to see those
[41:48] demons around
[41:51] him and he began to see those
[41:55] problems and he began to see um the
[41:58] bicycle
[42:01] wheel he began to
[42:04] drown because he had he has to keep his
[42:08] eyes on
[42:12] Jesus that's the only way we can go from
[42:15] here to
[42:18] there is that we keep our eyes on
[42:24] Jesus there's this little quote um from
[42:27] the message come follow
[42:32] me um I I wanted to send it to our
[42:35] brother Angel pinea and then when I
[42:37] started to listen or watch
[42:43] it it it really inspired me to read this
[42:49] today it's in the message come follow me
[42:55] 1963
[42:56] he said Lord
[42:58] Jesus
[43:00] youth men and women for
[43:05] tomorrow there's there's men and women
[43:08] here for
[43:11] tomorrow if there is a tomorrow he
[43:15] says we must train them
[43:18] Lord we fill that
[43:21] burden to train them like there will be
[43:24] a tomorrow
[43:29] if there is
[43:30] not then today is the
[43:35] day there is people men and women of
[43:39] tomorrow here
[43:42] today and if there is a
[43:46] tomorrow you'll be taking that
[43:49] torch that if there's a tomorrow you'll
[43:52] be growing and you'll be having children
[43:54] you'll be having family
[44:01] you'll be having careers and all these
[44:06] things if there is a
[44:09] tomorrow when when I was
[44:12] young and I was in
[44:14] school I I truly
[44:17] believed that I was never going to be
[44:19] able to graduate in
[44:24] 2009 I I was like nope I'm never going
[44:27] to
[44:29] graduate the Rapture is taking
[44:33] place and then when I
[44:36] graduated I
[44:38] believed I would never have children or
[44:41] be married or
[44:45] anything why the Rapture is at
[44:48] hand it's any
[44:50] moment it could happen
[44:52] tomorrow it could happen tonight
[44:56] and and you you start thinking those
[45:00] things well I'm never going to
[45:03] graduate I'm never getting getting
[45:06] married and then I I thought it kind of
[45:08] selfishly
[45:11] also like man I'm never going to be able
[45:14] to get
[45:17] married man I'm never going to
[45:20] graduate and I have my own
[45:23] car now I see myself
[45:27] I'm
[45:28] 32 and I'm serving the
[45:31] lord and and and if I would have never
[45:35] graduated if the Rapture would have took
[45:39] place I would have never been
[45:43] saved because I I gave my heart to the
[45:45] Lord at at 19 years
[45:49] old I would have never met my
[45:52] wife I I I would have never had children
[45:57] I would have never been able to serve
[45:58] God and his
[46:01] people time continued
[46:05] on even though we think it's tomorrow
[46:07] it's
[46:10] tomorrow then we wake
[46:12] up and we realize how old we
[46:17] are we we realize that that time has
[46:21] went
[46:23] on and we're still waiting for
[46:28] tomorrow we're still waiting for the
[46:32] Rapture and a lot of
[46:35] times a lot of times um it it'll
[46:39] paralyze a
[46:41] person it it scares them to from not
[46:45] doing certain
[46:48] things who remembers what what should
[46:51] have happened in
[46:54] 1977
[46:57] many people gave
[46:59] land many people uh uh stopped
[47:04] working many people thought that the
[47:07] Rapture was going to take place in
[47:13] [Music]
[47:14] 1977 and then time continued
[47:17] on in 2000 we thought what was it y
[47:22] [Music]
[47:23] 2kk everybody wased scared because this
[47:26] was the
[47:29] end and a lot of times what it does it
[47:32] it stops us from from these Earthly
[47:40] Ambitions brother bam says in 1963
[47:44] question and answers on the
[47:49] seals first of all he he had to calm the
[47:52] people

[47:58] same exact
[48:01] thing they said brother brandham should

[50:22] away just as hard as I can
[50:26] and when he when he
[50:27] comes I'll just drop that hole and take
[50:33] off and and we we've heard that quote
[50:36] many
[50:38] times that we live um like like we're
[50:41] going to live for a hundred
[50:45] years but be ready like he coming
[50:51] tonight and and and if I had um uh
[50:56] uh any uh advice to
[51:01] give it's it's fulfill your
[51:06] goals do what you what what you have in
[51:09] your
[51:11] heart many many people have Ambitions
[51:13] and
[51:16] goals and
[51:18] careers certain things that they want to
[51:22] accomplish and that's okay if we have
[51:24] certain visions for our
[51:27] life brother brandham says do that to
[51:30] the very last
[51:35] second it's make a goal for your life um
[51:38] young
[51:41] people you guys um many of you have
[51:45] graduated many of you are are going to
[51:50] graduate make a goal for your
[51:53] life but but when you put Christ in the
[51:56] center of that
[51:59] goal everything is is in
[52:03] equilibrium you don't go too much this
[52:05] way or you don't go too much that
[52:10] way you'll be the best at at what you do
[52:13] in your
[52:16] job not for anybody
[52:18] else but you do your job with with
[52:24] Thanksgiving
[52:25] you be the best student that that there
[52:27] ever ever
[52:30] is not for anybody
[52:32] else not for Jesus
[52:35] Christ you put him in the
[52:39] center watch watch yourself prosper in
[52:42] your
[52:46] job everything that you do just like
[52:51] Joseph even whenever he was in prison
[52:56] even when all of his brothers turned
[52:58] their back on
[53:01] him go he had a
[53:04] vision he had a vision saying one of
[53:07] these
[53:09] days I'm going to be standing on the
[53:12] right hand of that
[53:15] Throne he had a
[53:18] vision and when you have a
[53:21] vision everything becomes very very
[53:24] clear
[53:26] everything becomes very
[53:28] simple when we don't have
[53:31] visions we don't know where to
[53:33] go when we don't have visions we we
[53:36] don't know what to do we're we're all
[53:41] confused but when you have a vision for
[53:44] your
[53:45] life then everything becomes
[53:51] easy now the greatest
[53:54] ambition
[53:55] brother brandham says it continues on in
[53:57] the message come follow
[54:01] me and he and he's praying for the young
[54:04] people
[54:06] here these young people were about to
[54:10] graduate he preaches this message come
[54:13] follow
[54:15] me and now he's praying for them after
[54:17] the the the
[54:20] message he says that voice is still
[54:23] alive tonight
[54:28] and there's still post outposts
[54:30] listening
[54:35] posts receiving stations of
[54:39] faith that can accept
[54:42] it we we pray that each one of these
[54:45] children receive
[54:48] it receive that Lord in their
[54:53] hearts and remember remember
[54:56] that not what they um what they do to be
[55:02] good but they God does not judge us uh
[55:06] by what we
[55:11] do but by what we have
[55:15] accepted God doesn't judge us by our our
[55:21] works we are saved by our faith
[55:26] and not in our
[55:28] works so we pray heavenly
[55:32] father now I want you to pay attention
[55:35] to this
[55:37] part that they'll catch the vision
[55:42] now and see and hear the great Eternal
[55:46] invitation of come follow
[55:54] me
[55:55] the best thing to do is have a
[55:59] goal to have a vision of your
[56:02] life but the greatest vision for for you
[56:06] young
[56:08] people if you can catch this
[56:12] vision and hear this great Eternal
[56:17] invitation of come follow
[56:21] me then you're not looking at here or
[56:24] there
[56:28] your vision is in Christ
[56:32] Jesus and then
[56:35] everything work school
[56:40] family if if um there's a a girl you're
[56:43] interested or a boy you're interested
[56:48] in if if you're going on to the next
[56:51] chapter of your
[56:53] life everything is calibrated by that
[57:00] Vision everything is is the standard is
[57:04] that vision for
[57:09] everything amen Amen brother bam says
[57:12] another
[57:15] thing in the message as the eagle stth
[57:18] up her
[57:20] nest another thing the Church of the
[57:23] Living God
[57:26] is built uh or um is built
[57:32] high because it's got high anticipations
[57:36] and
[57:40] expectations say well we belong to the
[57:46] church Our Father served in this church
[57:48] years
[57:51] ago that might be
[57:53] fine but the Church of the Living
[57:58] God can't sit
[58:01] still its
[58:04] Ambitions is to go higher
[58:09] farther brother there's people with the
[58:11] greatest Ambitions in the
[58:15] world that they can see
[58:19] clearly how they can become a
[58:23] millionaire how they can control many
[58:25] many
[58:27] things and be
[58:31] CEOs and and and be
[58:34] uh Builders of of great
[58:38] things
[58:40] Visionaries but the greatest
[58:44] ambition is in the
[58:47] church because where our Ambitions
[58:49] aren't on the things that are going to
[58:51] fade
[58:53] away
[58:55] when you decide to trust in
[58:59] Jesus when you decided saying Lord I
[59:03] accept your
[59:07] blood I did I made my
[59:10] decision to serve you
[59:13] Lord you made the greatest
[59:16] decision and now you have the greatest
[59:21] ambition you have the greatest vision
[59:25] because it goes past
[59:29] work it goes past all the exciting
[59:32] things of the
[59:35] world it goes Plum into
[59:40] eternity that's the greatest Vision we
[59:42] could
[59:44] have and a lot of us here sitting
[59:48] today we've made our
[59:51] decision we've made our decision to
[59:53] serve the Lord
[59:57] we were in
[59:59] sin but the Lord took us out of that
[1:00:03] condition many people have given their
[1:00:05] heart to
[1:00:08] God years and years
[1:00:11] ago and they're solid in their position
[1:00:14] in
[1:00:16] Christ see see uh the Christian
[1:00:20] Life it's a
[1:00:22] journey that's why we we always talk
[1:00:25] about the three stages of
[1:00:28] Grace we talk about how how you have to
[1:00:32] the be in the Statue of a perfect
[1:00:36] man that it's steps and
[1:00:42] Journeys it's a
[1:00:44] pathway and many people are far into
[1:00:47] that
[1:00:50] pathway and there is many that that have
[1:00:53] just started
[1:00:56] there is many that have just been
[1:00:57] converted and and come to Jesus
[1:01:02] Christ and and I know sometimes we can
[1:01:08] think how can I come into this
[1:01:13] Perfection if I still need the Holy
[1:01:17] Ghost people are saying that Jesus might
[1:01:19] come
[1:01:22] tomorrow yet I still need to receive my
[1:01:25] holy
[1:01:28] spirit yet I I still feel like I need to
[1:01:31] be
[1:01:33] sealed sometimes I'm not
[1:01:36] patient sometimes I feel like I don't
[1:01:38] have the sufficient
[1:01:42] faith and then we could see that vision
[1:01:45] of eternal
[1:01:48] life the vision of whatever might be out
[1:01:53] yonder and then compare
[1:01:56] oursel in our present
[1:02:00] condition and say how am I going to go
[1:02:03] from here to all the way over
[1:02:09] there when Jesus Christ might be coming
[1:02:12] tomorrow
[1:02:14] night why Jesus might be coming
[1:02:19] tonight and yet I'm right
[1:02:23] here yet yet just I've given my heart to
[1:02:27] the Lord and I'm
[1:02:31] sincere and the fact that we are between
[1:02:34] these
[1:02:37] things of what shall be and what
[1:02:41] is it can create Agony in a person's
[1:02:47] life it can create uh uh complexes in
[1:02:52] somebody saying saying well how how how
[1:02:55] can I reach to that level of
[1:03:00] perfection but in Philippians
[1:03:05] 16 the Bible
[1:03:07] says being confident of this very
[1:03:13] thing that he that which hath begun a
[1:03:17] good work in you will perform it until
[1:03:20] the day of Jesus
[1:03:23] Christ
[1:03:26] [Music]
[1:03:28] if God called
[1:03:30] you he's got to finish the
[1:03:34] work if he started a work in
[1:03:38] you he's he has
[1:03:42] to because the he has to finish the
[1:03:46] work because the reason why I'm where
[1:03:49] I'm
[1:03:52] at even though sometimes it doesn't feel
[1:03:55] like very
[1:03:57] much it's not because of my
[1:04:00] merits it's by
[1:04:03] Grace by Grace you are
[1:04:06] saved and if by Grace you are
[1:04:09] saved by grace you'll receive
[1:04:12] justification sanctification and the
[1:04:14] Holy
[1:04:18] Ghost one thing I've always appreciated
[1:04:21] what brother Bernie preached on the
[1:04:23] three stages of Grace
[1:04:28] that he says it's three
[1:04:31] stages of one
[1:04:33] Grace you can only make those
[1:04:39] stages you can only
[1:04:42] walk you can only move
[1:04:46] forward you can only Advance as a
[1:04:50] Christian by
[1:04:52] grace and if by Grace you are saved by
[1:04:58] grace he'll see you
[1:05:00] through by
[1:05:03] grace and and I I heard my precious um
[1:05:07] Michael my precious brother
[1:05:10] Michael always talking about the 11th
[1:05:13] Hour
[1:05:15] worker that's in this time that we're
[1:05:19] living
[1:05:21] in that's what's going on
[1:05:24] that there's many people that have lived
[1:05:26] long
[1:05:29] lives that that have left the
[1:05:33] denomination that had to leave all those
[1:05:35] denominational
[1:05:39] thoughts and come into the realization
[1:05:41] of this
[1:05:44] message and receive the baptism of the
[1:05:47] Holy
[1:05:49] Ghost receive the unadulterated
[1:05:53] word
[1:05:54] see the manifestation of God in
[1:05:58] them and then somebody that just given
[1:06:01] their heart to the Lord just
[1:06:07] today can receive those same
[1:06:12] blessings that that person took 50 years
[1:06:16] to
[1:06:19] receive you can receive that Revelation
[1:06:23] tonight
[1:06:25] because those workers they worked all
[1:06:27] day
[1:06:30] long but when whenever the evening time
[1:06:35] came there was 11th Hour
[1:06:39] workers that received the same reward as
[1:06:43] those that worked all night or all
[1:06:50] day by faith you are saved
[1:06:54] and I don't know
[1:06:56] how I don't know how we'll get to that
[1:07:01] point but we know by Grace he took me
[1:07:04] out by Grace he'll take me
[1:07:09] on just as long as you keep your eyes on
[1:07:14] Jesus don't keep it on anything
[1:07:18] else and if if there's something that
[1:07:21] you desire to
[1:07:22] do
[1:07:26] base that that decision on Jesus
[1:07:30] Christ make Jesus Christ the
[1:07:34] standard make Jesus Christ the standard
[1:07:37] of of a person that you're talking to
[1:07:39] you're interested
[1:07:46] in make Jesus Christ a standard of any
[1:07:49] career decision you
[1:07:52] make
[1:07:56] then it doesn't
[1:07:57] matter if you're there in
[1:08:00] school if you're there in the farm like
[1:08:03] brother Bram
[1:08:07] says work to the very last
[1:08:11] second and God is faithful to call
[1:08:15] you because you've done
[1:08:18] everything you've believed in him you've
[1:08:22] kept your eyes on Jesus Christ
[1:08:26] and whatever stage that you're
[1:08:30] in it's okay that you're in that
[1:08:33] stage it's okay that you're you're in a
[1:08:37] a certain place that God has put you
[1:08:43] in God called the children of Israel out
[1:08:46] of
[1:08:48] Egypt that was good but then they kept
[1:08:52] going God put them in the Red
[1:08:58] Sea that's good but they kept
[1:09:01] going it's okay that you're in a stage
[1:09:04] that you're in
[1:09:08] today but let's not remain
[1:09:12] there because in order for us to reach
[1:09:14] our
[1:09:17] goal we we have to uh keep in
[1:09:22] mind we we have to keep our eyes focused
[1:09:25] on the
[1:09:29] goal Paul he had a vision and he had a
[1:09:31] goal ahead of
[1:09:34] him and he let us know that he kept his
[1:09:37] eyes on that
[1:09:40] goal he this man that that has done many
[1:09:43] many
[1:09:46] things the Bible says that he went up to
[1:09:49] the third
[1:09:51] Heavens he was he was the the first
[1:09:56] Apostle in in the church
[1:09:58] ages he was he was he was such a great
[1:10:04] man yet when he be to write to these
[1:10:09] people he said I count not myself to
[1:10:15] apprehend I I haven't reached it
[1:10:19] yet now this guy you could basically say
[1:10:22] he could be raptured at any
[1:10:29] moment yet in his
[1:10:32] caliber he said I still haven't reached
[1:10:35] what I
[1:10:37] needed I'm still
[1:10:40] pressing I press towards the
[1:10:44] mark and whenever there's a challenge
[1:10:46] facing
[1:10:49] you you need to learn just to press on
[1:10:52] keep going
[1:10:56] because God has a purpose for his
[1:10:59] children God has given us a vision
[1:11:03] today and this vision is greater than
[1:11:05] any Vision that we could ever have in
[1:11:08] the
[1:11:12] earth Proverbs 29 I want to read it one
[1:11:15] more
[1:11:17] time he says where there is no vision
[1:11:21] the people perish but he that keepeth
[1:11:24] the law happy is
[1:11:31] he where there is no
[1:11:34] vision what
[1:11:36] happens the people fall off of the
[1:11:39] plank the people begin to
[1:11:43] perish the the translation of
[1:11:46] vision it could be a
[1:11:49] dream a vision or a revelation re those
[1:11:55] that have that
[1:11:58] Revelation now we think when we think of
[1:12:00] revelation we think of something so
[1:12:05] high but it's whenever you have a Clear
[1:12:08] Vision or a clear
[1:12:12] look at Jesus
[1:12:14] Christ and he is your
[1:12:17] goal and whatever happens around
[1:12:21] you it doesn't matter cuz you're looking
[1:12:24] at
[1:12:26] him you caught the revelation of Jesus
[1:12:31] Christ brother brandham
[1:12:33] says he says I put my arm around
[1:12:38] him a real
[1:12:40] brother now this brother he asked
[1:12:42] brother
[1:12:44] brandham brother brandham brother
[1:12:47] brandham C can I see a
[1:12:50] vision can I have a vision
[1:12:54] brother Bram
[1:12:55] says I said beloved
[1:12:59] brother every time you open the
[1:13:03] Bible you see a
[1:13:05] vision God revealing
[1:13:09] himself here is God's
[1:13:12] Vision when you open it up and open and
[1:13:17] say God now open my eyes that I can see
[1:13:22] you
[1:13:24] the word is
[1:13:26] God in the beginning was the
[1:13:29] word and the Word was with
[1:13:31] God and the Word was
[1:13:34] God and the Word was made
[1:13:37] flesh and dwelt Among
[1:13:40] Us and and here's
[1:13:42] God every time you open the
[1:13:45] Bible you see a vision of
[1:13:48] God speaking forth to
[1:13:51] you set with a humble humble
[1:13:54] heart but you want to see your end
[1:13:59] goal you want you want to see the road
[1:14:04] map brother Bram says every time you
[1:14:07] open this
[1:14:10] Bible you'll see that
[1:14:13] Vision you'll see Jesus
[1:14:16] Christ vision is a look into your
[1:14:21] future your vision will keep you
[1:14:26] moving because you're looking at the
[1:14:30] destination you're looking at the end
[1:14:33] goal and it's something that you can't
[1:14:37] touch it's something that's not here
[1:14:40] yet but it's something that only you and
[1:14:43] only you can
[1:14:46] see and sometimes it'll it'll break
[1:14:49] families
[1:14:51] up sometimes your friends will reject
[1:14:55] you because they don't understand your
[1:14:59] vision sometimes they have only um
[1:15:02] chicken
[1:15:05] Visions visions of of how to be
[1:15:09] successful visions of how to be
[1:15:13] rich visions of of of
[1:15:17] beauty Vis visions of of all the
[1:15:19] goodness of this world that has to give
[1:15:25] and that's
[1:15:26] good we could have those
[1:15:28] things but there is a
[1:15:31] vision that is greater than any Vision
[1:15:34] out
[1:15:36] there it make you stand
[1:15:39] out it'll make you
[1:15:41] change it'll make you go to the Bible
[1:15:44] says the narrow
[1:15:47] way not everybody goes into that narrow
[1:15:51] W because it's a hard
[1:15:54] way but let me tell you
[1:15:56] what that it there's light in that
[1:16:00] way that you'll be going to a
[1:16:04] place you'll be going to a destination
[1:16:07] of eternal
[1:16:09] life but the Bible says it says when we
[1:16:13] don't have that
[1:16:15] Vision we
[1:16:17] perish now if we think we're going to
[1:16:22] die
[1:16:24] or or or something bad is going to
[1:16:26] happen that's what we think when we hear
[1:16:31] perish but that Hebrew
[1:16:35] translation it means to let
[1:16:39] loose to loose of
[1:16:45] restraint to go
[1:16:47] back to make
[1:16:49] naked to
[1:16:52] uncover whenever we lose that
[1:16:56] Vision we we don't have no more
[1:16:58] discipline in our
[1:17:00] lives now what I've
[1:17:04] realized there's a big
[1:17:07] difference in discipline without
[1:17:12] Vision because we can discipline
[1:17:17] ourselves we could look the
[1:17:21] part we could do everything we
[1:17:25] could to look like a
[1:17:28] Christian but if we don't have an end
[1:17:32] goal see I I
[1:17:34] believe a lot of
[1:17:36] times that that people lose their
[1:17:41] vision of why they're
[1:17:46] Christians they lose that
[1:17:49] Vision they just come to church because
[1:17:51] that's what they've always done
[1:17:56] they they it becomes
[1:17:58] routine it it becomes something that
[1:18:01] okay I just got to do this and um donate
[1:18:04] my two
[1:18:10] hours and we lose the
[1:18:13] vision we lose the reason why we're
[1:18:15] actual
[1:18:18] Christians and what happens is when we
[1:18:20] lose that
[1:18:21] vision
[1:18:24] then then we we lose the
[1:18:29] restraint when you lose the
[1:18:32] vision that's when you go off the
[1:18:36] path and and we can go and we can be
[1:18:38] doing things that like Christians
[1:18:44] do but it has no
[1:18:47] value because the only thing that has
[1:18:51] value
[1:18:53] is when you're walking in that
[1:18:57] path I could say I'm going to go walk
[1:19:01] home and if I start walking that
[1:19:06] way there is no value in what I just
[1:19:10] said I'm I lost
[1:19:13] track and I'm not going to reach my
[1:19:17] destination and and whenever we lose
[1:19:19] path in our
[1:19:21] lives
[1:19:24] we're not going to reach that
[1:19:26] destination because we kept we lost our
[1:19:29] eyes on Jesus
[1:19:32] Christ we have to keep our eyes on Jesus
[1:19:37] Christ but the Bible
[1:19:39] says he says but he that keepeth the law
[1:19:42] happy is
[1:19:46] he because the Bible and the word is the
[1:19:51] vision
[1:19:53] now we we we've got
[1:19:56] to um live
[1:20:00] intentional we've got we've got to make
[1:20:02] sure that that when you catch the
[1:20:07] vision when you catch that
[1:20:10] Vision you begin to live life on
[1:20:14] purpose everything you do is
[1:20:18] intentional remember when the little
[1:20:20] kids they they would hit one another
[1:20:24] my little boy sitting over
[1:20:26] there when he hits his
[1:20:29] sister and she oh she starts
[1:20:33] crying and it was on accident it was on
[1:20:38] accident she said no it was on
[1:20:42] purpose it was a it was he did it for a
[1:20:47] purpose he did it
[1:20:49] intentionally that's how we got to live
[1:20:51] life
[1:20:54] we got to live life wake up every single
[1:20:58] day and live life on
[1:21:02] purpose Brothers I'll tell you something
[1:21:04] about my
[1:21:06] life the biggest waste of my
[1:21:10] time is whenever I forget to live on
[1:21:16] purpose whenever I lose my eyes off of
[1:21:19] the
[1:21:21] goal Brothers God created the fish to
[1:21:27] swim he created the birds to
[1:21:30] fly and when you take them out of their
[1:21:33] natural
[1:21:35] habitat they're going to
[1:21:38] perish God created
[1:21:40] us in his own
[1:21:43] image to fulfill his
[1:21:46] purpose and when you leave that natural
[1:21:51] habitat we are bound to
[1:21:54] perish because so we every single day we
[1:21:57] have to live in our
[1:22:01] purpose even even every single person
[1:22:04] has a purpose to serve the
[1:22:09] Lord every single person has a
[1:22:12] gift to give to the
[1:22:15] Lord and you know what I've always
[1:22:19] noticed a gift is the easiest thing you
[1:22:22] can do
[1:22:26] why because it is
[1:22:28] you you were born to do
[1:22:31] it you you didn't have to um you didn't
[1:22:34] have to think that Jesus did this on
[1:22:39] accident no he was the
[1:22:42] savior he was born for to be a
[1:22:47] savior so whenever Christ is near
[1:22:51] you you have to
[1:22:54] expect that something is going to
[1:22:56] happen because that was his
[1:23:00] purpose to heal you to save you to
[1:23:04] restore you to give you everything you
[1:23:07] [Music]
[1:23:09] needed why that was his
[1:23:13] purpose and whenever he fulfilled his
[1:23:17] purpose he said it is
[1:23:20] finished and then he died
[1:23:23] you you know the most beautiful thing
[1:23:25] that I
[1:23:27] saw is when somebody says I've done
[1:23:30] everything I
[1:23:34] could and they get to go on to be with
[1:23:37] the
[1:23:38] Lord I remember when when my
[1:23:42] dad my dad he never cried in front of
[1:23:47] me he never
[1:23:49] cried I never see him I probably I could
[1:23:52] could count with my my
[1:23:56] fingers all the times I've seen my dad
[1:24:00] cry but that was whenever he was coming
[1:24:03] to the the end of his
[1:24:06] life he seemed
[1:24:09] healthy he seemed
[1:24:11] okay but but there was one time where he
[1:24:14] pulled me
[1:24:16] aside and he began to
[1:24:19] cry and he says I'm ready to go
[1:24:24] I I don't want to be here no
[1:24:26] more but he said but but the reason I'm
[1:24:31] here is for your sister now I didn't
[1:24:35] understand what what why he said that
[1:24:37] what he was
[1:24:41] saying but he was telling me that that
[1:24:44] was the reason he was
[1:24:48] there and then I would have dreams of
[1:24:50] him leaving but something was holding
[1:24:52] him
[1:24:55] back and then there was a point in his
[1:24:59] life to where he could tell me
[1:25:05] smiling he says your sister doesn't need
[1:25:08] me
[1:25:10] anymore and that that would that's very
[1:25:14] strange to
[1:25:16] me and whenever he
[1:25:19] left there was almost
[1:25:23] nothing for me to grab on
[1:25:27] to because it was almost like he said it
[1:25:30] is finished I'm done with my
[1:25:36] purpose I'm done with what I
[1:25:40] did and brothers I'll tell you
[1:25:43] honestly I he left and my heart was was
[1:25:48] okay with
[1:25:51] it
[1:25:52] our brother Johnny he
[1:25:55] passed and he fulfilled his
[1:25:59] purpose but Brothers with my
[1:26:02] ignorance I hurt more for brother
[1:26:08] Johnny than my own
[1:26:11] father because I in my
[1:26:13] mind I I said oh there's so much to
[1:26:17] do we got to fulfill so much
[1:26:21] things
[1:26:22] and when he
[1:26:23] left I know it hurt so many
[1:26:27] people because we saw the hand of God
[1:26:33] moving but the brother he he didn't
[1:26:36] leave without fulfilling his
[1:26:40] purpose God will not take
[1:26:43] somebody if he hasn't fulfilled his
[1:26:46] purpose
[1:26:48] yet he set everything in order so that
[1:26:51] we could take the Baton
[1:26:55] not not as a
[1:26:57] church as
[1:27:00] individually individually I could take
[1:27:02] the Baton of my
[1:27:05] father I could take the Baton of my
[1:27:08] pastor brother
[1:27:10] Nick you can take the Baton of brother
[1:27:15] Bernie we could take the Baton of
[1:27:17] brother Johnny
[1:27:21] Alo
[1:27:22] and we could fulfill our
[1:27:25] purpose and keep
[1:27:27] going not a not a purpose of Earthly
[1:27:32] things but
[1:27:34] Jesus Jesus that's the only
[1:27:38] purpose if we we revolve
[1:27:43] everything on Jesus
[1:27:46] Christ then nothing's going to fail
[1:27:48] around
[1:27:50] you because you are on the
[1:27:55] goal you haven't apprehended
[1:27:58] yet but you press
[1:28:01] forward you got to keep pressing
[1:28:04] forward and look towards that
[1:28:07] goal and one of these
[1:28:09] days you're going to see Christ face to
[1:28:14] face and you could say it and thank the
[1:28:19] Lord that I wasn't looking at the wheels
[1:28:23] I wasn't looking at the
[1:28:26] plank I wasn't looking at this or
[1:28:29] that I was looking at Jesus
[1:28:32] Christ and as far as I
[1:28:35] know I see Jesus Christ all here
[1:28:40] tonight that's our
[1:28:42] goal is so that we can project Jesus
[1:28:45] Christ to one
[1:28:48] another so that we could be a
[1:28:51] light to those that are
[1:28:55] unfortunate so that we could give
[1:28:57] eternal
[1:28:59] life to those that are asking for
[1:29:04] water that's the reason we're
[1:29:07] here that's the
[1:29:10] purpose the purpose is Jesus
[1:29:13] Christ that's the
[1:29:16] purpose let let us stand to our
[1:29:19] feet that's the only thing that will get
[1:29:23] us to that
[1:29:26] side and all we have to do is go step
[1:29:30] after step after step if the musicians
[1:29:32] would like to come
[1:29:37] up sometimes when we look at the
[1:29:41] vision when we look at at the eternal
[1:29:45] life ahead of
[1:29:48] us we say Lord how am I going to be able
[1:29:51] to get there
[1:29:55] and my answer to you
[1:29:58] is day by day by
[1:30:01] day every day just serve him the best
[1:30:04] you
[1:30:07] can every day keep your eyes on Jesus
[1:30:12] Christ and that'll just if you're you're
[1:30:14] falling that'll adjust
[1:30:19] you why because you're looking at at
[1:30:22] Jesus
[1:30:24] Christ let us bow our
[1:30:26] heads oh Heavenly
[1:30:29] Father Lord I just ask that you keep us
[1:30:33] in inside of you
[1:30:38] father Lord that we can trust in you in
[1:30:41] every step that we
[1:30:45] take Lord you said that the steps of a
[1:30:47] righteous
[1:30:50] man are ordered by the
[1:30:54] Lord father the steps make me recognize
[1:31:00] father that it's a
[1:31:02] progress that it's a
[1:31:05] process that we're not going to get
[1:31:07] there from day to night
[1:31:10] Lord but father it's by every single
[1:31:13] time we
[1:31:17] believe every day we can trust in you
[1:31:20] father
[1:31:23] even though we could say I'm not what I
[1:31:25] want to
[1:31:27] be I'm not what I what I ought to
[1:31:31] be but we can say that we've have
[1:31:37] progressed that that I'm not who I used
[1:31:39] to
[1:31:41] be that Lord you called us out of the my
[1:31:46] reclaim you took us out of
[1:31:49] sin you took us out of a how found
[1:31:54] life and Lord you set us in Heavenly
[1:31:59] places you set us in your bosom so that
[1:32:02] we could trust in you
[1:32:06] Lord father we're trusting in
[1:32:09] you we know father that you're faithful
[1:32:11] to take us all the
[1:32:15] way we ask all this in the precious name
[1:32:18] of Jesus
[1:32:20] Christ
