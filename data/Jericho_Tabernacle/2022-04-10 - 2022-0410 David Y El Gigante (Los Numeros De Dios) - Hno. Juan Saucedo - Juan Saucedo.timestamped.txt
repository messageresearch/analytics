[1:08:11] church
[1:08:13] but today gracias adios we thank god
[1:08:19] for science has increased in a wonderful
[1:08:21] way
[1:08:25] and as sons and daughters of god we have
[1:08:27] to know how to use it
[1:08:33] because if not that would turn into a
[1:08:35] giant
[1:08:41] and this morning my uh title of my
[1:08:43] message
[1:08:47] i want to call it david and the giant
[1:08:50] dapidi
[1:08:57] and as a subtitle i would like to call
[1:08:59] it god's numerals
[1:09:02] god's numerals
[1:09:21] and the years that the lord allows us to
[1:09:23] travel in this life
[1:09:27] it's always made up of numbers
[1:09:44] we know that it's happened to several
[1:09:46] pressures
[1:10:40] when i came to you came not with the
[1:10:42] excellency of speech or of wisdom
[1:10:44] declaring unto you the testimony of god
[1:10:50] brother bannon would always emphasize
[1:10:52] and he would say i never had an
[1:10:53] education
[1:10:56] i'm not as educated as other men are you
[1:10:59] tomorrow
[1:11:01] i just uh pay attention to the natural
[1:11:04] things
[1:11:07] to be able to talk about spiritual
[1:11:08] things hermanos educacion as
[1:11:13] education is something that's good
[1:11:20] we would always want and we want for our
[1:11:22] children to have an education
[1:11:38] not only here locally but them that are
[1:11:39] watching online as well
[1:11:44] there's a lot that watch us online
[1:11:49] so we want god to bless and help them
[1:11:51] los hollande es que nos
[1:12:00] maybe they're not watching right now at
[1:12:01] this moment at 10 in the morning because
[1:12:03] they have their own services
[1:12:12] after the service and they watch us
[1:12:15] so may god bless the young people
[1:12:20] and we
[1:12:29] uh perhaps many of us like myself we
[1:12:31] didn't have the way amina gustava
[1:12:33] escuela mencantaval
[1:12:47] but unfortunately i did not have the way
[1:13:20] and they have a good job in employment
[1:13:21] to take their family forward
[1:13:26] now the apostle paul here is talking to
[1:13:27] us about that
[1:13:35] he says and my brother when i came to
[1:13:37] you came not with the excellency of
[1:13:39] speech or of wisdom declaring unto you
[1:13:41] the testimony of god
[1:13:51] for i determined not to know anything
[1:13:53] among you save jesus christ and him
[1:13:55] crucified
[1:13:57] christ
[1:14:01] christ and him crucified may that be our
[1:14:04] main theme
[1:14:06] may that be our everything
[1:14:11] but because many times when we come up
[1:14:13] here we're uh we're fearful
[1:14:18] and we read here that paul was with fear
[1:14:20] and trembling
[1:14:23] not because he didn't know what to say
[1:14:40] because he did
[1:14:52] and what a privilege
[1:14:57] for example many students that have the
[1:14:59] opportunity to go to the university have
[1:15:01] gone
[1:15:03] universidad
[1:15:05] if they reach the university even their
[1:15:07] parents are proud of them
[1:15:48] and here it is i was with you in
[1:15:50] weakness and in fear and in much
[1:15:52] trembling enemy
[1:16:01] espiritu
[1:16:03] [Music]
[1:16:04] in my speech and my preaching was not
[1:16:06] with enticing words of man's wisdom but
[1:16:08] in demonstration of the spirit and of
[1:16:10] power
[1:16:15] we go through very tough days
[1:16:32] and from then on we have to go to
[1:16:34] calvary every one of us i have to preach
[1:16:38] because we want to say something that
[1:16:40] will actually help you
[1:16:42] that's why we come here to this place
[1:16:45] so that god can help us if you all know
[1:16:47] why you are a traveler
[1:16:49] and god will help us through the
[1:16:50] ministry
[1:16:54] god will help us through what was
[1:16:55] already said yes
[1:16:58] it's already there
[1:17:26] brothers we go through a calvary
[1:17:32] the one that says he does it will let me
[1:17:33] know so that i can do the same as well
[1:17:36] because it truly is a calvary
[1:17:41] i remember when i would come when i was
[1:17:43] a visitor entrepreneurs
[1:17:47] i remember when i went to the mcdowell
[1:17:49] church
[1:17:51] and brother johnny allowed me to speak
[1:17:54] and i mentioned it
[1:17:57] i said the brothers that help are
[1:17:58] brother johnny siempre esteem
[1:18:01] always be ready
[1:18:04] always be prepared
[1:18:08] because you don't know when brother
[1:18:10] johnny will call you
[1:18:11] pare
[1:18:14] so you can stand up here to say
[1:18:16] something to god's people and
[1:18:19] so we prayed at our house
[1:18:22] we study at our house
[1:18:53] and we sit down at church you are a
[1:18:56] bingo i stay listen now i come to this
[1:19:00] i'm i'm part of a member of this church
[1:19:05] so i come to sit down in here
[1:19:11] and when i hear these young people
[1:19:12] brothers
[1:19:15] when i go out and i and i greet my
[1:19:16] brother
[1:19:20] i
[1:19:33] young people that the lord has given us
[1:19:35] gloria glory to be to be honest
[1:19:40] this morning i want to repeat
[1:19:43] i want to explain and talk about
[1:19:47] predicates
[1:19:50] on subjects that the brothers the
[1:19:52] preachers have already spoken
[1:19:57] and of course something that brother
[1:19:58] adam has already said
[1:20:01] verse 4 again
[1:20:11] and my speech and my preaching was not
[1:20:13] with enticing words of man's wisdom si
[1:20:15] no con demostration
[1:20:45] of an israel everyone knows that
[1:20:49] and we're still in the battle brothers
[1:20:51] gloria glory to his name
[1:20:53] uh
[1:20:57] representative
[1:21:16] for they had to fight for every inch of
[1:21:17] ground were as they were going forward
[1:21:20] blessed be the name of our lord
[1:21:26] now this morning i would like to speak
[1:21:28] about david and the giants
[1:21:34] and i want to mention that i also want
[1:21:36] to talk about joshua and caleb
[1:21:39] and if you notice
[1:21:45] all the preachers if you go two months
[1:21:46] in the past
[1:21:50] and you just pay attention to the kind
[1:21:51] of preachings that we've had here today
[1:21:58] every one of them in some way or another
[1:22:00] have mentioned joshua and caleb
[1:22:06] uh in the meeting that we had we had
[1:22:07] brother judah mata with
[1:22:20] he almost read the same scripture to us
[1:22:31] and the message brother eli preached on
[1:22:33] friday was really awesome it was really
[1:22:34] good
[1:22:40] the next day my son jonathan comes some
[1:22:41] of you know him and some of you don't
[1:22:43] but
[1:22:46] he told me i want you to tell brother
[1:22:48] eli castillo
[1:22:50] that he
[1:22:56] tell him that i really loved what he
[1:22:58] said on friday
[1:23:01] but make sure you tell him
[1:24:04] when i also when i saw that the the logo
[1:24:06] said jericho on it
[1:24:10] i joined with the thought that brother
[1:24:11] donais had enough
[1:24:16] there's other places that the name of
[1:24:17] the church is also jericho
[1:24:24] but when i heard what brother ordonez
[1:24:26] explained about jericho
[1:24:28] represent
[1:24:43] because the name of our place is jericho
[1:24:44] tabernacle
[1:24:48] and i really liked what our brother said
[1:24:51] about joshua
[1:24:53] and we've read it
[1:24:57] but maybe perhaps i just didn't pay
[1:24:59] attention
[1:25:04] but when the brother mentioned joshua
[1:25:06] the destroying angel
[1:25:10] [Music]
[1:25:24] lord
[1:25:28] we're happy and grateful with the lord
[1:25:31] but only one house remained
[1:26:08] god help us
[1:26:10] bless us
[1:26:12] to be able to to do that
[1:26:14] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:26:18] david in the giants
[1:26:21] i don't know how many are fighting
[1:26:22] against giants
[1:26:25] but i do it every day
[1:26:27] every day
[1:26:30] every day i'm fighting
[1:26:33] and there is not a day that passes that
[1:26:35] i don't fight it's on gigantes and they
[1:26:37] are giants
[1:26:41] many times they want to they want to
[1:26:43] scare us and terrorize us
[1:26:45] but uh know one thing
[1:26:48] if god
[1:27:05] if the brothers can put up the picture
[1:27:06] that i gave him
[1:27:08] we're going to talk about a giant
[1:27:12] media
[1:27:15] did anyone anyone ever think what was
[1:27:17] the height or the measurement of this
[1:27:19] giant goliath
[1:27:22] i was interested to go and look that up
[1:27:29] and i found out that goliath was nine
[1:27:32] feet and six inches
[1:27:35] nine feet six inches tall
[1:27:39] uh the player that you see right there
[1:27:41] in that picture
[1:27:43] is eight three
[1:27:44] three he's
[1:27:52] and just look at the uh the size of the
[1:27:54] other player that wants to take the ball
[1:27:56] away
[1:27:58] just look how uh he's looking down on
[1:28:00] him
[1:28:03] he's looking down on him as if he was
[1:28:04] nothing
[1:28:10] like he's looking down saying like what
[1:28:12] are you to do to me
[1:28:15] just imagine goliath
[1:28:18] thank you we have another one
[1:28:22] hopefully they can put the next one
[1:28:26] this picture that's there is
[1:28:28] an americano it's a it's an american
[1:28:34] he was born in an eastern city here of
[1:28:36] the united states
[1:28:40] unfortunately at the age of 22 years of
[1:28:42] age he passed away
[1:28:45] because his heart couldn't endure
[1:28:47] problems
[1:28:49] he had heart problems
[1:28:52] because of his height
[1:28:56] he was eight feet eleven inches tall
[1:28:58] ocho pierce onsen
[1:29:01] eight feet 11 inches tall
[1:29:03] persona natural
[1:29:06] just look how an average size person
[1:29:08] looks next to him
[1:29:13] so just so you can bear in mind this
[1:29:16] great giant that we're talking about
[1:29:21] so that's what uh his height was
[1:29:23] 811.
[1:29:27] and goliath was nine feet tall and six
[1:29:29] inches
[1:29:32] he was nearly a foot taller than this
[1:29:34] man

[1:29:40] less
[1:29:40] five feet
[1:29:43] cinco pierce or less five feet or menos
[1:29:49] 11. he wasn't five eight or five eleven
[1:29:52] cinco piers or less

[1:30:02] when he came face to face with this
[1:30:03] giant ese gigante
[1:30:18] god is in numbers
[1:30:31] just look how they look
[1:30:46] how about we get you and put you there
[1:30:47] in the picture
[1:30:51] help us
[1:30:54] brothers and sisters we're fighting
[1:30:56] against giants
[1:30:59] every day we fight giants is
[1:31:11] if we trust in our own height what
[1:31:13] height
[1:31:22] we're trusting in him in the same one
[1:31:24] that david trusted him

[1:32:06] going to mention things that the
[1:32:07] brothers have already spoken about when
[1:32:10] rodriguez

[1:33:21] them

[1:33:27] rodriguez rodriguez
[1:33:33] he read a quote in the message the
[1:33:35] greatest battle ever fought ime gusto
[1:33:37] and i liked it i really loved it
[1:33:39] i wrote it down
[1:33:44] and i went and searched the message the
[1:33:46] greatest battle ever fought
[1:33:47] [Music]
[1:34:02] blessed
[1:34:10] just pay attention to what brother
[1:34:12] rodriguez read when he gave the
[1:34:13] testimony about the brothers in nebraska
[1:34:28] if you can find it that's fine if not
[1:34:29] just listen this is
[1:34:36] he says now this is what i'm saying this
[1:34:38] morning
[1:34:42] i'm storing food
[1:34:44] estoy
[1:34:56] he doesn't change he's the same and
[1:34:58] those is are you
[1:35:00] so there is a storehouse
[1:35:03] what are store houses for los alamos
[1:35:08] store houses are made with the intention
[1:35:10] to store up food los alamos
[1:35:17] or storages are meant to put away
[1:35:19] thousands of ganons of diesel of gas
[1:35:23] now the profit
[1:35:25] when he would go to jeffersonville
[1:35:36] when he was in jeffersonville he said
[1:35:37] we're going to preach the messages here
[1:35:39] because there'll be food in due season
[1:35:51] and he would come to jeffersonville and
[1:35:53] there that's where he goes
[1:36:00] so that's what i'm talking about this
[1:36:01] morning i'm storing food
[1:36:04] how many believe that
[1:36:07] i'm storing food imagine
[1:36:35] i was actually scared when i saw it for
[1:36:37] the first time
[1:36:38] i got scared
[1:36:42] of california
[1:36:45] la paz baja california
[1:36:48] solamente
[1:36:50] la paz
[1:36:52] when there wasn't a rodeo you would
[1:36:54] either arrive by plane or buy a ship
[1:36:58] juanitos
[1:37:01] and of course juanito saucedo couldn't
[1:37:03] arrive in la paz on a plane
[1:37:08] i went and uh i boarded the ship
[1:37:14] uh it was called
[1:37:16] that was the name of the ship
[1:37:18] and
[1:37:36] around two in the morning i got up from
[1:37:37] my seat and i went outside
[1:37:41] and i thought i was going to see lights
[1:37:42] and i didn't see any lights
[1:37:46] what was happening was actually i was
[1:37:48] falling down
[1:37:52] so i had an experience right
[1:37:55] that i said to the lord
[1:37:58] if you allow me to get yourself
[1:38:09] i'll promise i'll think about it before
[1:38:11] i board another ship
[1:38:14] so
[1:38:25] it's better that we don't drink so much
[1:38:26] water they say
[1:38:28] he says we might finish the water at the
[1:38:30] sea
[1:38:32] two little fish
[1:38:34] at the sea
[1:38:37] i think it's better if we don't drink up
[1:38:39] that much water
[1:38:41] because we can run it out
[1:38:46] it doesn't make any sense right
[1:38:48] it's the sea
[1:38:50] in egypt now
[1:38:52] those great storehouses
[1:38:57] were they stored up for seven years of
[1:38:58] prosperity
[1:39:00] brothers and sisters
[1:39:03] just imagine two little mice
[1:39:07] they might say oh we better not eat so
[1:39:08] much
[1:39:23] when we come to hear the message
[1:39:28] when god speaks to us through the vessel
[1:39:30] that he appointed
[1:39:34] what we're listening is food for us
[1:39:38] and they're taking it out of that great
[1:39:40] storehouse
[1:39:42] so blessed be the name of our lord
[1:39:47] food so you have something to eat
[1:39:52] so that you have something to feast upon
[1:39:56] get it on your tapes
[1:40:04] maybe when i'm long ways away

[1:41:14] work and i said go back to berwinito

[1:46:10] we're talking
[1:46:20] so that you can have a picture in your
[1:46:21] mind
[1:46:23] about what we're trying to talk about
[1:46:34] the spirit of the sword they say la
[1:46:37] palabras
[1:46:42] he says the word of god is sharper than
[1:46:44] a two-edged sword according to hebrews
[1:46:46] 4. amen
[1:46:47] brothers
[1:46:52] let's
[1:47:20] here's where we're going to start
[1:47:22] talking about the gracias adios numeros
[1:47:24] god's numerals and we thank god for his
[1:47:26] numerals
[1:47:33] do you know when brother juanito knew
[1:47:34] how to multiply and divide
[1:47:37] and as i mentioned before i really liked
[1:47:39] schools
[1:47:43] and maybe with what i say you might say
[1:47:45] back oh brother i don't really i think
[1:47:46] you really didn't like it
[1:48:01] i was in second grade
[1:48:07] math was always something that would
[1:48:08] cause me headaches
[1:48:12] whenever we had to do that at school
[1:48:16] for me that
[1:48:53] 19 he says now i want you to bear in
[1:48:55] mind
[1:48:58] he
[1:49:12] but we have to know
[1:49:27] we're coming out of the world we're
[1:49:28] coming out of the wilderness
[1:49:31] he says i want you to bear in mind
[1:49:35] there is a church and a bride
[1:50:11] and he says and god runs his messages in
[1:50:14] the numerals of the bible
[1:50:17] do you believe it i believe it this
[1:50:18] morning
[1:50:22] god runs his message in the numerals of
[1:50:25] the bible
[1:50:29] and if you get something that flies off
[1:50:32] one of those numbers
[1:50:34] you better watch
[1:50:47] if you keep reading you'll find brother
[1:50:48] branham said it's like a rifle
[1:51:17] even though you have a license
[1:51:21] but you cannot just hunt any animals
[1:51:29] it has to be the specific animal that
[1:51:30] they're telling you that it's the season
[1:51:32] of hunting for that animal amen
[1:51:37] he says if the rifle
[1:51:40] the hunting brothers
[1:51:42] if you i aim the rifle
[1:51:44] and the sight is fine
[1:52:10] or maybe your rifle needs to be adjusted
[1:52:33] we know that gas today is very up in
[1:52:36] prices
[1:52:43] so we would like to find a gas station
[1:52:45] that would sell the lowest
[1:52:48] and many times we're going through
[1:52:49] corners just watching
[1:52:52] but we can't find something that's
[1:52:54] cheaper california especially in
[1:52:55] california
[1:52:58] super expansive in california hermanos
[1:53:00] hermanos brothers and sisters
[1:53:03] but we have to fill our tanks with gases
[1:53:07] we have to put gas in the car no matter
[1:53:09] the price look you are going to you
[1:53:12] idiot so what i do with god's help
[1:53:16] is i keep the tank full
[1:53:21] and every on every third day i go to a
[1:53:23] gas a gas station and i fill it up
[1:53:27] and i only have to pay fifteen dollars
[1:53:31] even though the price is being so high
[1:53:36] sometimes i have to pay 20 and they have
[1:53:37] to give me some money
[1:53:57] because the gas tank is letting us know
[1:54:00] that we're almost out of gas
[1:54:03] but thank god we're on a saturday
[1:54:06] and then sunday's coming up
[1:54:11] and we know that we have to we have to
[1:54:12] go we have to
[1:54:14] we have to get uh come to a gas station
[1:54:18] because our car is being left without
[1:54:20] any fuel
[1:54:22] so when we come to church
[1:54:24] why do we come
[1:54:27] out
[1:54:27] to fill our cup once again
[1:54:31] i don't know how you are this morning
