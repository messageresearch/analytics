[56:56] we made
[56:57] extension or an invitation to the young
[56:59] men of jericho
[57:04] uh you know to have some fellowship
[57:07] outside of church
[57:11] we've tried to do breakfast and dinner
[57:13] and things
[57:15] you know
[57:17] because we see each other in church with
[57:18] the suit and the tie all the time
[57:23] dressed our best in acting our best
[57:29] but what about the christian life that
[57:30] we have outside of this church
[57:36] to be able to have some nice christian
[57:38] healthy fellowship
[57:40] [Music]
[57:50] but we look forward to having some of
[57:51] those young men next time for some good
[57:52] healthy fellowships
[57:59] and i don't want to keep you standing
[58:00] too long if you'd be so kind as to turn
[58:02] in your bibles to matthew 22. no quiero
[58:04] montenegro de masado tiempo si
[58:11] and we're going to be reading from verse
[58:12] 34 to verse 40.
[58:19] and
[58:20] the title this morning
[58:27] and it's going to be agapo number two
[58:32] i didn't plan for this to
[58:34] transpire into a number two or a number
[58:36] three or number four no um
[58:42] but as a subtitle i'd like to uh if we
[58:45] could say corrections
[58:50] so this is the scripture we read last
[58:51] time we were up here
[58:55] and it reads but when the pharisees had
[58:57] heard that he had put the sadducees to
[58:59] silence they were gathered together
[59:17] master which is the great commandment in
[59:20] the law maestro is the grandmother
[59:24] jesus said unto him thou shalt love the
[59:26] lord thy god with all thy heart and with
[59:29] all thy soul and with all thy mind
[59:45] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[59:51] on these two commandments hang all the
[59:53] law and all the prophets
[59:57] prophets
[1:00:03] we thank you lord for another
[1:00:04] opportunity to be in your house
[1:00:09] lord we ask you father that you would
[1:00:10] take preeminence in this service senor
[1:00:12] te
[1:00:36] and to continue to love our brother and
[1:00:39] love you is
[1:00:53] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[1:00:55] pray
[1:00:57] amen amen you may be seated brothers
[1:01:02] if you'd like to keep your bibles open
[1:01:06] uh if you'd like to turn in galatians
[1:01:07] chapter six
[1:01:16] to try and give an uh a start to our
[1:01:19] subtitle corrections
[1:01:27] brethren if any man be overtaken in a
[1:01:30] fault ye which are spiritual restore
[1:01:33] such a one in the spirit of meekness
[1:01:36] considering thyself lest thou also be
[1:01:39] tempted
[1:01:52] bear ye one another's burdens and soul
[1:01:54] fulfill the law of christ
[1:02:01] so i'm gonna read it from another
[1:02:02] version for a dummy like me
[1:02:06] different person
[1:02:08] that helps me understand this a bit es
[1:02:11] says dear brothers and sisters
[1:02:15] if any other believer is overcome by sin
[1:02:22] if any other believer that's to your
[1:02:23] right or to your left that becomes
[1:02:25] overcome by sin
[1:02:32] you who are godly
[1:02:35] should gently and humbly help that
[1:02:37] person back to the right path
[1:02:44] and be careful not to fall in the same
[1:02:46] temptation yourself
[1:02:52] and i like verse 2.
[1:02:55] share each other's burdens
[1:02:59] like a brother eli preached a long time
[1:03:01] ago
[1:03:03] so has that heart have that
[1:03:04] understanding for your neighbor your
[1:03:06] brother your sister
[1:03:11] you can share that burden by simply
[1:03:13] listening to them
[1:03:27] and as the scripture says and in this
[1:03:30] way obey the law of christ
[1:03:35] in such doing so we can obey our opening
[1:03:38] scripture
[1:03:42] to love god with all our hearts
[1:03:46] and to love our neighbor or our brother
[1:03:48] with all our hearts
[1:03:52] in the message titled the approach to
[1:03:54] god
[1:04:08] did you ever know that every son that
[1:04:10] cometh to god must first be tried
[1:04:17] whipped child whipping correction
[1:04:23] since it's not easy
[1:04:35] god will give you a real old-fashioned
[1:04:38] spanking for it
[1:04:53] i don't want to expand on that no
[1:04:56] expander
[1:04:57] but i think that's a pretty good
[1:04:58] statement for my brother
[1:05:03] we can just give a little bit more of
[1:05:04] that to our children
[1:05:16] so he gives you a little whooping so
[1:05:18] that you can get straightened up
[1:05:22] that little daughter that's a little
[1:05:24] rebellious needs that little whooping to
[1:05:25] straighten up
[1:05:31] papa god with that rebellious son he has
[1:05:33] needs a little whooping so he could
[1:05:34] straighten
[1:06:02] where i could say i love them more after
[1:06:04] that whooping and yo
[1:06:08] on the contrary i did the same thing my
[1:06:10] father did yeah
[1:06:13] he got whooped so much i got whooped so
[1:06:15] much
[1:06:34] my father used to give me weapons and i
[1:06:36] thought
[1:06:40] oh my i wish i could just call that that
[1:06:43] old gray-headed brother father
[1:06:57] he says i would respect every weapon
[1:07:00] that he ever gave me
[1:07:05] i never got even as much as i needed
[1:07:09] i thought so then
[1:07:12] but i don't
[1:07:26] what a lesson the prophet teaches us
[1:07:27] with that
[1:07:30] his dad wasn't living right
[1:07:34] we know the errors that our mother and
[1:07:36] our father have in the homes
[1:07:46] but nonetheless they want the best for
[1:07:48] us
[1:07:51] so i can respect i love how brother
[1:07:53] branham says that foreign
[1:08:04] mom and dad gave me cadase
[1:08:08] because it corrected
[1:08:16] they wanted the ultimate goal for me to
[1:08:19] serve the lord jesus christ with all my
[1:08:21] heart
[1:08:35] what about the heavenly parent the lord
[1:08:37] jesus christ
[1:08:40] he has to correct us
[1:08:44] not he might correct us
[1:08:46] but he wants to correct us
[1:09:02] then we become illegitimate children of
[1:09:04] god
[1:09:30] doesn't matter if it's an elder sister
[1:09:31] elder brother
[1:09:45] if they come and approach you without a
[1:09:46] gop
[1:09:58] that makes you an illegitimate child
[1:10:04] we have to be able to withstand
[1:10:06] correction is necessary
[1:10:09] correction says if you're really born
[1:10:11] again this is
[1:10:28] then there's nothing that can separate
[1:10:30] you from god
[1:10:34] absolutely nothing nada in absolutely
[1:10:37] brown says that's right this is
[1:10:40] neither starvation nor perils nor trials
[1:10:42] nisikera
[1:10:45] suffering death nothing can separate us
[1:10:47] from the love of god
[1:10:51] you might be saying well brother
[1:10:52] sometimes it's just too much
[1:10:57] you know there's too much correction
[1:10:58] upon correction and correction
[1:11:02] always going through these trials and
[1:11:04] tribulations
[1:11:07] the suffering is just too much for me
[1:11:11] well if we can suffer with him now
[1:11:15] we can suffer with him on this earth in
[1:11:17] this flesh now
[1:11:21] then we will reign with him tomorrow
[1:11:36] he embraced the suffering that was put
[1:11:38] upon him while he walked this earth
[1:11:40] off
[1:11:43] the suffering that we go through in our
[1:11:45] christian walk
[1:11:48] christiano is what molds us into the
[1:11:51] character of jesus christ
[1:11:55] and he went through the ultimate
[1:11:56] suffering
[1:11:59] suffering all the way to the last
[1:12:01] breaths of his life
[1:12:05] when he was facing death face to face
[1:12:10] to let this cup pass over me
[1:12:15] why have you forsaken me
[1:12:18] he was suffering
[1:12:20] but he suffered so that he can be that
[1:12:22] agape love
[1:12:27] love can give us eternal life
[1:12:31] that we can be born again by the holy
[1:12:33] ghost through that agape love
[1:13:15] temptation in there
[1:13:31] but with christ there are no days off
[1:13:34] we are carrying that cross daily
[1:13:39] and daily and daily and daily
[1:13:42] and he says follow me
[1:14:07] and keep on going
[1:14:09] it makes me think of the the hiking trip
[1:14:10] we took on saturday with the young men
[1:14:12] mensah
[1:14:27] we've got to climb trees and jump over
[1:14:29] rocks
[1:14:32] and maybe squirm through cactus and
[1:14:33] things like that
[1:14:37] but the path was already paved for us
[1:14:41] the footsteps were already set out for
[1:14:43] us to get to our destination
[1:14:48] and the path is already set for us to
[1:14:49] get to that capstone love it
[1:14:53] is
[1:15:08] this brother
[1:15:23] what it's supposed to produce
[1:15:26] let suffering produce in your life
[1:15:30] what it's supposed to produce in your
[1:15:32] christian life
[1:15:36] romans 5 3 says and romano cinco tres
[1:15:38] disen says not only so
[1:15:41] esto but we glory in tribulations or
[1:15:44] sufferings
[1:15:47] knowing that this suffering worketh our
[1:15:50] patience
[1:16:15] the wife you said i do to at the altar
[1:16:18] que es esposa
[1:16:22] for about nine months isn't the same
[1:16:24] exact wife you said i do too at that
[1:16:25] altar
[1:16:30] i need a little bit more patience
[1:16:41] they start getting their own little
[1:16:42] ideas and ways of thinking at school
[1:16:48] i need a little bit of patience to deal
[1:16:49] with that
[1:16:52] i need patience to deal with my brothers
[1:16:54] and sisters here necessarily
[1:16:58] it's not that we don't like each other
[1:16:59] no
[1:17:10] i was raised this way you were raised
[1:17:11] that way yes
[1:17:25] that can help us love one another
[1:17:40] well you know what the remedy is
[1:17:50] you know they're suffering it it makes
[1:17:52] me it makes me get this bitterness this
[1:17:54] depression is
[1:17:58] the more i suffer the more hatred i
[1:18:00] start to get for people
[1:18:04] well it's just a simple question
[1:18:07] are we in the spirit are we in the flesh
[1:18:11] are we in the spirit or are we in the
[1:18:13] flesh
[1:18:16] the bible says that which is born in the
[1:18:17] flesh is flesh
[1:18:21] and i know every one of us are born in
[1:18:22] the flesh
[1:18:25] but that which is born of the spirit is
[1:18:27] spirit the bible says
[1:18:31] and somebody in here has got to be born
[1:18:33] of the spirit this morning
[1:18:37] somebody probably could say it
[1:18:38] confidently
[1:18:43] you know we got those humble brothers
[1:18:44] too yes brother that's i've been born in
[1:18:46] the spirits
[1:18:51] there's some who don't even know i don't
[1:18:53] know if i've been born again yet or if i
[1:18:54] haven't been born again
[1:18:59] but there might even be someone here
[1:19:01] this morning
[1:19:03] they're saying i know i haven't been
[1:19:05] born again
[1:19:06] jose
[1:19:16] you can be born of that spirit this
[1:19:17] morning
[1:19:20] so everyone that's been born of that
[1:19:22] spirit
[1:19:25] let's let's read this scripture here
[1:19:28] for those of you that said it
[1:19:30] confidently
[1:19:32] i've been born again of that spirit
[1:19:40] who shall separate us from the love of
[1:19:42] christ
[1:19:47] or distress
[1:19:56] well in my version of the bible it
[1:19:58] doesn't say what shall separate us from
[1:20:00] the love of christ
[1:20:09] what the tribulation what the distress
[1:20:11] what the persecution
[1:20:16] it says who shall separate us
[1:20:20] there's a who that's bringing all these
[1:20:22] afflictions on us
[1:20:28] these are attributes of that who is
[1:20:44] he allows me to go through the suffering
[1:20:45] i'm going through right now this morning
[1:20:51] but it's satan the one who's inflicting
[1:20:53] those things upon you
[1:20:58] he thinks satan thinks that he's kicking
[1:20:59] you down and bringing you down
[1:21:04] but the truth is god is just trying to
[1:21:06] lift you up lift you up
[1:21:12] he's trying to take us to a higher place
[1:21:14] through that suffering that we're going
[1:21:15] through
[1:21:19] so we need to stop giving satan the
[1:21:21] power over us
[1:21:35] nothing can separate you from the agapo
[1:21:38] love of christ
[1:21:49] nor can satan separate you from the love
[1:21:51] of christ
[1:21:54] if agapo
[1:22:37] and that experience brings forth hope
[1:22:39] the bible says
[1:22:42] hope in the agapo love of god that's in
[1:22:45] every one of your hearts
[1:22:50] the bible says that's given to us by the
[1:22:52] holy ghost
[1:22:57] but says in the message led by the
[1:22:58] spirit of god this is
[1:23:02] preached in 1956
[1:23:04] when
[1:23:30] and thy staff they comfort me this is
[1:23:57] in the book of revelations even depicts
[1:23:59] it as a rod of iron
[1:24:08] like when you're scared and mama comes
[1:24:10] and gives you that warm hug to make you
[1:24:12] feel good for example
[1:24:28] they let me know this is
[1:24:31] that god is with me que dios esta con
[1:24:34] migo because he corrects me from all my
[1:24:36] wrongs
[1:24:39] somebody got wrongs this morning
[1:24:42] better believe god's going to correct
[1:24:44] you of those wrongs
[1:24:48] well bryan says maybe he's trying to
[1:24:49] correct you tonight
[1:24:53] why don't you let the rod and staff
[1:24:56] comfort you
[1:25:08] the hard preaching of the gospel from
[1:25:10] the pastor the
[1:25:17] it's that hard preaching of the gospel
[1:25:19] that's that rock
[1:25:21] is the predication
[1:25:23] says it's a comfort to let me know
[1:25:28] that god speaks to me que vios
[1:25:31] when that type of gospel is being
[1:25:33] preached to correct me
[1:25:38] correction
[1:25:48] legitimate sons of god we need to accept
[1:25:50] that correction
[1:26:21] many times it's from the ministry to the
[1:26:23] sheep
[1:26:24] is the ministerio
[1:26:27] and then many times that correction
[1:26:28] comes from the sheep to the ministry
[1:26:34] you know
[1:26:40] but you know when you said that about
[1:26:42] what brother branham said
[1:26:43] he says
[1:26:45] he didn't really say that
[1:26:47] correction
[1:26:49] you know when you read that part of the
[1:26:50] bible the bible doesn't mean that us
[1:26:55] that's correction
[1:26:57] you know brother marcos when you heard
[1:26:58] me that other day
[1:27:00] hermano marcos
[1:27:02] that's corrections
[1:27:18] when i first started the relationship
[1:27:20] with our brother michael when you come
[1:27:21] and send me relations
[1:27:23] brother michael started walking with the
[1:27:24] footsteps of the lord
[1:27:29] i remember i told him
[1:27:31] you know he started growing a fondness
[1:27:33] for me and we started establishing a
[1:27:34] friendship
[1:27:39] and i wanted to make sure that he knew
[1:27:41] clearly
[1:27:45] i said not
[1:27:58] even not be of available own choosing
[1:28:03] i might even do it unconsciously without
[1:28:04] even thinking
[1:28:08] because i want you to know i'm just a
[1:28:09] man
[1:28:11] so take your eyes off any man
[1:28:15] make sure to always keep them on christ
[1:28:20] because no matter how much of a friend i
[1:28:22] can beat to you
[1:28:26] how much of a brother i can be to you
[1:28:28] que clase de hermano yo polo
[1:28:30] man is still prone to making mistakes
[1:28:35] but the spiritual man
[1:28:37] spiritual the spiritual man is prone to
[1:28:39] accepting that correction
[1:29:08] is
[1:29:22] they comfort me commodities
[1:29:27] says he loved me
[1:29:30] he wants me to walk with him
[1:29:34] so that he can walk with me in that hour
[1:29:36] parker
[1:29:39] you know so now we've come to a place
[1:29:42] we understand you know god loves me with
[1:29:44] this agape love
[1:29:48] and now with that agape love now i can
[1:29:50] give some of that agape love
[1:29:55] and with that agape love i can now
[1:29:57] embrace the suffering that i go through
[1:29:59] in my life
[1:30:04] because now i know suffering builds my
[1:30:05] character of christ
[1:30:10] so i'm now a legitimate son and daughter
[1:30:13] of god
[1:30:15] because i love corrections
[1:30:19] well let's read first john 4 20.
[1:30:24] it says first john 4 20.
[1:30:27] if a man says
[1:30:30] i love god and hateth his brother he is
[1:30:33] a liar for he that loveth god and loveth
[1:30:36] not his brother whom he hath seen
[1:30:38] how can he love god whom he hath not
[1:30:41] seen
[1:30:42] he says
[1:31:00] but okay let's correct that
[1:31:03] i love god
[1:31:05] i just don't like my brother man
[1:31:08] gusta manuel no just the way he is i
[1:31:10] just don't like him too much
[1:31:14] i've been falling in love with the
[1:31:15] concordance lately
[1:31:19] and maybe if i can give you some
[1:31:21] homework
[1:31:23] you know go look up every time the word
[1:31:25] love is used
[1:31:29] and find when it's used in the sense of
[1:31:30] filio and when it's used in the sense of
[1:31:32] agapo logo
[1:31:35] de la morphilo
[1:31:37] and you'll see how many times we need to
[1:31:39] use that higher level of love
[1:31:55] i love god with that heavenly love that
[1:31:57] capstone love
[1:31:59] celestia
[1:32:01] what i hate is my brother
[1:32:03] then he is a liar
[1:32:06] you cannot agapo god and filio your
[1:32:08] brother
[1:32:10] agape
[1:33:33] as soon as he stops doing those things
[1:33:37] i start running out of that love for him
[1:33:41] but when you've got that agape love
[1:33:44] it's an unconditional love
[1:33:47] never-ending love
[1:33:50] that no matter how much he offends me
[1:33:54] no matter how much he he speaks bad
[1:33:56] about me
[1:33:59] just like jesus at the cross it didn't
[1:34:00] matter what they said about him
[1:34:02] jesus
[1:34:26] there's nothing we can do to make him
[1:34:28] love us
[1:35:02] we hear his voice when he speaks to us
[1:35:06] you know we we hear his voice that we
[1:35:08] recognize when he's talking
[1:35:12] you know we
[1:35:27] stop paying your ties
[1:35:30] and then you know a month down the road
[1:35:33] you fall into some great financial
[1:35:35] crisis in your life
[1:35:40] right away
[1:35:48] i've seen your correction lord please
[1:35:50] forgive me you know you're you you cheat
[1:35:51] your brother in a business deal
[1:35:58] and maybe in a week or so at work
[1:35:59] someone cheats you out of a job or some
[1:36:01] money in kisas
[1:36:07] and the light switch turns on oh this is
[1:36:09] god correcting me
[1:36:13] and so on and so forth example after
[1:36:15] example after example
[1:36:19] somehow we accept and we recognize this
[1:36:21] is a form of god's judgment or god's
[1:36:23] punishment
[1:36:29] the correction he's trying to bestow on
[1:36:30] me for something i've done or or lacked
[1:36:33] doing la corazon
[1:36:46] it seems like it's just so easy to
[1:36:48] accept
[1:36:56] and you accept it and you embrace it and
[1:36:57] you ask for forgiveness
[1:37:01] but somehow
[1:37:02] when it takes place in here but this
[1:37:19] when we get some heavy correction from
[1:37:21] inside the church
[1:37:26] from this family of believers
[1:37:30] i want to read the scriptures
[1:37:47] says moreover if thy brother shall
[1:37:49] trespass against thee
[1:37:54] go and tell him his fault between thee
[1:37:56] and him alone
[1:38:00] if he shall hear ye hear thee
[1:38:03] thou has gained thy brother
[1:38:07] so if your brother has sinned against
[1:38:09] you entonces
[1:38:12] has has uh offended you done something
[1:38:14] to hurt you
[1:38:16] is saying uh nice and clear go with him
[1:38:19] in privacy
[1:38:24] go express yourself to him
[1:38:27] go talk to him
[1:38:34] and it says if he shall hear you if you
[1:38:37] say
[1:38:38] you have gained your brother back
[1:38:41] so there is an opportunity between you
[1:38:44] and him to fix the situation
[1:38:50] if you can come in that love
[1:38:54] if you can project that love
[1:38:57] love
[1:39:11] but can receive it through the love you
[1:39:13] projected to him
[1:39:18] or he already has that love
[1:39:21] but just made a mistake
[1:39:24] and your love and his love come together
[1:39:29] your holy spirit and his holy spirit
[1:39:31] come together
[1:39:35] that sin or that offense is rectified
[1:39:51] one or two more that in the mouth of two
[1:39:53] or three witnesses every word may be
[1:39:55] established
[1:40:02] there can still be a gobble up
[1:40:06] maybe you couldn't project the words
[1:40:07] that needed to be said
[1:40:10] necessarily but maybe the deacon you
[1:40:12] took with you can you oh bro
[1:40:17] you took with you he can ela
[1:40:21] because we're still trying to gain our
[1:40:23] brother back
[1:40:27] even though he made a mistake
[1:40:30] even though he committed an offense
[1:40:32] towards
[1:40:34] 17 says and if he shall neglect to hear
[1:40:37] them
[1:40:40] then tell it to the church
[1:40:42] then bring that case to the church
[1:40:46] and if you neglect to hear the church is
[1:40:50] then let it be unto him
[1:40:53] let him be as a heathen man and a
[1:40:55] republican
[1:40:58] as a sinner a heathen or any other tener
[1:41:13] that can end up in a judgment that needs
[1:41:15] to take place
[1:41:30] like verse 15 says commodities
[1:41:32] for the sole purpose to gain thy brother
[1:41:35] back
[1:41:39] but now we have a different example of
[1:41:41] correction
[1:41:44] both of these are scriptural ambos
[1:41:47] both of these are valid
[1:41:50] both both of these can and should be
[1:41:52] applied
[1:41:56] second corinthians chapter two second
[1:42:10] for out of much affliction and anguish
[1:42:12] of the heart i write
[1:42:26] which i have for you is i have more
[1:42:28] abundantly unto you
[1:42:33] don't be sad with this letter that i'm
[1:42:35] writing i want to let you know i love
[1:42:36] you more than you even imagined
[1:42:55] this correction that this brother was
[1:42:57] given
[1:43:00] this judgment that this sister was given
[1:43:04] it's sufficient yeah
[1:43:06] it's enough yes
[1:43:08] she's been through enough already
[1:43:11] she's gone through enough uh suffering
[1:43:13] already from that yeah
[1:43:17] but paul is trying to say that
[1:43:20] and he says which was inflicted of many
[1:43:25] it could have been inflicted of the many
[1:43:27] of that family towards that person
[1:43:35] it could have been inflicted of many the
[1:43:37] whole church towards that one person
[1:43:43] but he's saying it's enough that's
[1:43:45] enough punishment that's enough
[1:43:46] suffering
[1:44:15] go and comfort that brother go and
[1:44:18] comfort that sister via consular alert
[1:44:22] it says lest perhaps such a one should
[1:44:25] be swallowed up with over much sorrow
[1:44:31] we leave them out to die
[1:44:34] we leave them out in the wilderness
[1:44:36] we leave them out in that punishment
[1:44:38] that judgment los jamos de castillo in a
[1:44:41] sequel that correction that led them
[1:44:42] astray and correction
[1:44:45] they left them all alone out there
[1:44:49] if we live let that be see
[1:44:52] that and we can't come to a point of
[1:44:54] forgiveness
[1:44:57] a point of comfort that we can extend to
[1:44:59] them al punto de el consuelo
[1:45:06] that person is going to be swallowed up
[1:45:08] with spirits of depression
[1:45:12] of maybe suicide of sorrow all
[1:45:28] that you would confirm your love toward
[1:45:30] him
[1:45:33] once again this love
[1:45:35] is este in the concordance
[1:45:38] to confirm your filial toward him
[1:45:54] he deserved to hate that man that killed
[1:45:56] his son
[1:46:17] that can love him no matter what that
[1:46:19] person's done
[1:47:02] i forgive in the person of jesus christ
[1:47:08] i think verse 11 is for those that were
[1:47:10] a little more mature
[1:47:14] because paul is telling corinthians
[1:47:18] corinthians if we don't do this
[1:47:47] and the accused will fall into a spirit
[1:47:48] of hate
[1:47:52] to the audio or resentment
[1:47:54] he says because we cannot be ignorant of
[1:47:57] the devil's devices
[1:48:01] because that is what the devil wants
[1:48:05] he wants separation
[1:48:07] he wants division
[1:48:09] he wants enmity
[1:48:11] he wants you to hate your brother and
[1:48:13] sister on your side
[1:48:29] let's turn off those fleshly eyes
[1:48:34] let's shut off that filial love of his
[1:48:36] flesh
[1:48:39] and get into the spirit we claim we're
[1:48:42] born in
[1:48:43] this spirit de la cuatro
[1:48:46] and start to project to our brothers and
[1:48:48] sisters that have offended us
[1:48:55] because we're not ignorant of how the
[1:48:58] devil operates
[1:49:25] my brother ricardo did la costa queso
[1:49:27] del mano ricardo the word says that
[1:49:29] requires judgment
[1:49:32] you know
[1:49:33] some of us we can stand on the word
[1:49:38] over preserving a human relationship
[1:49:40] embezzy
[1:49:54] of reconciling the reconciliation of
[1:49:57] forgiving the pardon of restoring and
[1:50:00] rescuing
[1:50:02] you know brother just don't say that
[1:50:04] about brother man you don't know the
[1:50:05] situation he's in description
[1:50:10] if you knew the circumstances that he
[1:50:12] had to go through that's why he said
[1:50:14] what he said
[1:50:18] that's why he acted the way he acted
[1:50:22] i have a little bit of grace for my
[1:50:23] brother
[1:50:25] have a little bit of mercy and
[1:50:26] understanding for my brothers
[1:50:30] but if we're not careful
[1:50:33] both of those can fall into an error
[1:50:36] almost that's why we read the two
[1:50:39] different types of corrections
[1:50:43] standing on the word el para la palabra
[1:50:46] calling out the sin exponent
[1:50:48] bringing the correction
[1:50:50] and giving
[1:51:17] is also backed up by the word
[1:51:21] espaldado por la palabra if we are all
[1:51:23] judgment and no grace
[1:51:27] we're out of cater estamos fuera de
[1:51:29] orden if we're all grace and never give
[1:51:32] anyone judgment
[1:51:47] but this word will pull you here and
[1:51:49] it'll pull me here
[1:51:53] and that agapo love and correction will
[1:51:55] keep us right down the center yes
[1:52:00] i'm starting to close now yeah
[1:52:04] i want to share a couple of testimonies
[1:52:07] when i first arrived here to phoenix
[1:52:11] and speaking about correction
[1:52:14] trying to be respectful and honest
[1:52:19] within the first couple of months that i
[1:52:20] lived here
[1:52:24] shortly after brother johnny passed this
[1:52:25] was the key for you know johnny i was
[1:52:27] out at walmart one night with my wife
[1:52:29] and my family
[1:52:33] family and walmart we had to pick
[1:52:35] something up and just put some clothes
[1:52:36] on real quick
[1:52:40] and i found a deacon of jericho
[1:52:42] tabernacles
[1:52:47] and he sees me and greets me
[1:52:50] hello brother marcos how you doing hello
[1:52:52] marcos como estas we talked for about 30
[1:52:54] minutes 40 minutes i don't know how long
[1:52:56] hour
[1:53:25] and he starts talking to me and
[1:53:28] he says oh brother you remember when i
[1:53:30] saw you there at walmart the other day
[1:53:34] yeah you know brother uh well you know
[1:53:36] i'm nobody to tell you and this is
[1:54:09] and i know the brother knows who i'm
[1:54:10] talking about
[1:54:13] but in a good spirit in that agape love
[1:54:19] he said brother uh the clothing you were
[1:54:21] wearing
[1:54:24] it was not convenient or uh it's not
[1:54:27] prudent for you to dress that way
[1:54:32] and he started to explain to me why and
[1:54:34] the reasons and everything
[1:54:39] i hope you don't get scandalized by this
[1:54:43] brother marcos still has that sodom and
[1:54:45] gomorrah spirit from california hanging
[1:54:47] on him
[1:54:52] maybe that was the last one that i had
[1:54:53] to kind of kick off my body i don't know
[1:54:58] but uh it wasn't that i was shirtless or
[1:55:01] skulls or the crazy clothing nothing
[1:55:03] like that
[1:55:09] but the brother in that love
[1:55:14] starts to explain it to me why it's not
[1:55:15] prudent to have been dressed that way
[1:55:20] and he used examples of his children and
[1:55:22] his family and brothers so that i could
[1:55:24] understand clearly that this was being
[1:55:26] given in love
[1:55:34] now right away i have the option
[1:55:36] immediately
[1:55:38] who is this brother yesterday
[1:55:41] this isn't wrong esther is my lord i can
[1:55:43] show this to everyone in church and
[1:55:44] nobody will say this is wrong
[1:55:50] but this is a deacon that this church
[1:55:52] voted
[1:55:56] that this church believes has a certain
[1:55:58] wisdom of the word world
[1:56:02] he is my elder elizabeth and he came to
[1:56:05] me to express something that is of my
[1:56:08] benefit
[1:56:11] beneficial if he didn't have a gap loved
[1:56:15] and i didn't have a gap
[1:56:17] there is no way i could apply that
[1:56:19] correction in my life
[1:56:24] i took it i accept it and i applied it
[1:56:28] i appreciate it
[1:56:30] well brother you know it's easy to take
[1:56:32] it from a deacon
[1:56:35] they're the police of the church
[1:56:38] if brother says that barks at me i'm
[1:56:40] gonna get to running
[1:56:47] what about
[1:56:48] anybody else
[1:56:50] what about our sisters
[1:56:52] what about our elders
[1:57:11] and there was an elderly sister there
[1:57:13] having her auntie
[1:57:17] forgive me
[1:57:19] and she greeted me
[1:57:33] [Music]
[1:57:36] d
[1:57:40] [Laughter]
[1:57:50] you know it's up to me is my body going
[1:57:52] to receive it or reject it
[1:57:58] and and the sister says
[1:58:00] uh brother marcos you know how how you
[1:58:02] been and so on hey marcos
[1:58:14] [Music]
[1:58:18] these are some tapes that i don't listen
[1:58:20] to anymore but i think they'll be good
[1:58:22] for you in your ministry
[1:58:29] and and right away
[1:58:32] i could have thought in my mind
[1:58:35] what does this sister think she is
[1:58:38] i've been praying preaching for so and
[1:58:40] so years and i know so much and this and
[1:58:42] that yeah
[1:58:46] i could have think that way
[1:58:49] oh yes sister i really appreciate it
[1:58:51] thank you
[1:58:54] gracias
[1:58:56] she keeps going
[1:58:58] and she says i don't see your fellowship
[1:59:00] no more this is
[1:59:03] it's it's i haven't seen a long time no
[1:59:05] le vista mucho tiempo oh sister you know
[1:59:07] we get busy and
[1:59:09] things happen
[1:59:13] oh no i understand oh i see yo yo
[1:59:20] and i get emotional
[1:59:24] because the next word she says
[1:59:28] i didn't get emotional then
[1:59:32] but now i reflect on it
[1:59:35] and she says you know your wife
[1:59:38] it'd be nice if she starts coming
[1:59:43] and
[1:59:44] that she might be able to have but
[1:59:48] some more friends mas amigas
[1:59:50] now
[1:59:51] i shared something at the at the youth
[1:59:53] fellowship or the youth breakfast we had
[2:00:24] we didn't have friends amigos we didn't
[2:00:26] have anybody
[2:00:28] and how we've been longing for friends
[2:00:33] and not so much me
[2:00:36] necessary for me you know i grew up in
[2:00:38] this christian walk yo christine is the
[2:00:40] camino christian but more so for my wife
[2:00:44] and and i get emotional right now
[2:00:48] because
[2:00:50] you know
[2:00:51] the elders are the wisdom of the church
[2:00:56] and for some reason
[2:00:58] you know an elder sister like that
[2:01:02] who can just sit back
[2:01:05] and just observe
[2:01:22] because there's a certain sense of
[2:01:23] experience that you can't buy at the
[2:01:25] grocery store
[2:01:28] experience
[2:01:30] and maturity and wisdom that comes with
[2:01:32] age
[2:01:47] and that was a form of correction for me
[2:01:48] yes una forma de correction for me that
[2:01:51] she projected so much agape love to me
[2:01:54] okay
[2:01:57] that instead of rejecting the words that
[2:01:58] she said
[2:02:01] instead of getting offended at the the
[2:02:03] the recommendations that she gave
[2:02:05] embezzle
[2:02:07] recommendations
[2:02:09] i took them in la
[2:02:11] and i applied them
[2:02:12] and i put them into effect into my life
[2:02:18] every christian born of the spirit
[2:02:20] should accept corrections
[2:02:25] you can tell when it's coming from a
[2:02:27] place of agape love
[2:02:33] whether it's from your younger brother
[2:02:34] whether it's from the pastor it doesn't
[2:02:36] matter
[2:02:38] no important correction can come in many
[2:02:41] different shapes and sizes
[2:02:58] speaking
[2:03:05] when my father first began his christian
[2:03:07] walk
[2:03:11] during that time as he explained where
[2:03:13] my mother was taking away from him
[2:03:20] brother
[2:03:21] if you know brother jimmy garcia
[2:03:24] garcia and various brothers from here in
[2:03:26] phoenix
[2:03:29] along with my father they all worked in
[2:03:31] construction
[2:03:33] in the construction a few names just to
[2:03:35] name some brother paul uh i believe
[2:03:37] brother alex baroona worked here as well
[2:03:43] and there was also a brother by the name
[2:03:45] of billy contreras
[2:03:49] now this brother billy had spent some
[2:03:51] time here in phoenix uh our estermano
[2:03:53] billy avia posado um
[2:04:07] he knew a whole lot about the message
[2:04:09] and about the bible
[2:04:13] now i know this testimony because it's
[2:04:14] been told to me ever since i was a
[2:04:16] little boy all right
[2:04:21] i wasn't born yet i was born in 1989.
[2:04:26] and so when my father just come into
[2:04:28] church he called me padres
[2:04:31] he had already been in for some time
[2:04:35] but as my dad came in
[2:04:38] he started to drift out
[2:04:41] and at that stage my dad didn't
[2:04:42] understand too much about the message of
[2:04:43] christianity
[2:04:49] but my dad brother jimmy brother billy
[2:04:51] they all work together in the same place
[2:04:56] and since he billy didn't go to church
[2:04:58] anymore but he still went to work
[2:05:03] my dad was like his handyman
[2:05:07] and he would always tell him about
[2:05:08] revelations and preach to him about the
[2:05:10] bible and stimulate him with that first
[2:05:12] love my dad
[2:05:16] is
[2:05:39] and he starts to talk to him about his
[2:05:40] condition in the church
[2:05:44] the way he's been living
[2:05:54] because he was living in a state of
[2:05:56] fornication at that time
[2:06:00] so he had taken my dad as a witness
[2:06:04] now the testimony is brother billy never
[2:06:06] fought back
[2:06:11] he was decent he was very polite
[2:06:14] and
[2:06:27] for you to pray and to meditate
[2:06:43] and brother jimmy called my dad to go
[2:06:44] see billy again as a witness
[2:06:50] billy
[2:06:51] billy you know have you thought about
[2:06:53] things yeah
[2:06:55] it's been 30 days now yeah
[2:07:10] i'm going to have to apply that which
[2:07:12] paul says in the scriptures
[2:07:16] and still billy in a good spirit iona
[2:07:19] sibili
[2:07:21] well composed
[2:07:23] comportado didn't fight back
[2:07:26] we could say
[2:07:29] uh he had an agape spirit to him
[2:07:35] not of contention or fighting
[2:07:38] he just
[2:07:39] had a mistake that he made in his walk
[2:07:44] jimmy said well that's fine brother
[2:07:48] no if you're not going to fix anything
[2:07:52] that was a wednesday
[2:08:04] i'm going to do something that i've
[2:08:05] never done in my life
[2:08:20] first
[2:08:24] it's reported commonly that there is
[2:08:26] fornication among you
[2:08:31] and such fornication that is not named
[2:08:33] among the gentiles
[2:08:38] and you are puffed up and have not
[2:08:40] rather mourned
[2:08:43] and and that he had that has done this
[2:08:46] deed might be taken away from you he was
[2:08:48] established
[2:08:56] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[2:09:01] when ye are gathered together in my
[2:09:03] spirit
[2:09:06] with the power of the lord jesus christ
[2:09:10] deliver such a one unto satan
[2:09:16] for the destruction of the flesh
[2:09:20] that the spirit may be saved on the day
[2:09:22] of the lord jesus
[2:09:26] jesus my dad and brothers testify that
[2:09:29] there was an atmosphere so heavy that
[2:09:31] wednesday night at church
[2:09:37] like never felt before he says
[2:09:41] to the point where they were up there
[2:09:43] behind the pulpit trembling
[2:09:48] and as brother jimmy was giving that
[2:09:49] sentence to turn that brother into the
[2:09:51] hands of satan
[2:09:57] my dad says i'd never seen brother jimmy
[2:09:59] cry before in my life
[2:10:04] and during that sentence
[2:10:07] well that same weekend
[2:10:10] semana brother billy went to phoenix
[2:10:12] billy for phoenix i believe there's
[2:10:14] brothers here that know brother billy
[2:10:18] and he went to see brother paul and
[2:10:19] brother bernie el foravera
[2:10:22] he spoke to brother paul
[2:10:24] pablo and after a week from that
[2:10:26] sentencing it
[2:10:28] is a sentence we have a freeway there in
[2:10:31] california the 94.
[2:10:33] in california
[2:10:35] and he swerved off the exit of that
[2:10:38] freeway in his truck
[2:10:54] brother paul mentioned after brother
[2:10:55] billy's funeral el mono pablo mentioned
[2:10:59] because brother billy died that day
[2:11:03] that when they had spoken
[2:11:05] god gave him an opportunity to
[2:11:07] straighten up his life
[2:11:11] but he didn't choose to do so
[2:11:14] so god had to take his life
[2:11:18] because he wouldn't be able to live the
[2:11:20] life
[2:11:22] now
[2:11:34] that there wasn't a single wound or
[2:11:36] bruise on his entire body
[2:11:42] in that wreck that took place
[2:11:45] the only impact that happened
[2:11:49] something flew and struck him right on
[2:11:51] his heart
[2:11:55] and killed him right at that impact
[2:12:00] no broken limbs or any of these things
[2:12:05] many brothers from phoenix went to that
[2:12:07] funeral habia muchos de manos de
[2:12:08] finisque foreign brother paul told them
[2:12:10] all the same things
[2:12:14] god had to take his life
[2:12:17] because he wasn't going to be able to
[2:12:19] live that life
[2:12:22] before he can fall in the hands of satan
[2:12:26] i'm going to take my son back home
[2:12:30] i'm not going to lose one of my homes
[2:12:46] so god had to take him off the earth
[2:12:50] and as my dad was sharing that testimony
[2:12:52] with me
[2:12:54] testimonial because i wanted to share
[2:12:56] with you all this morning
[2:12:59] my mother was falling asleep on the
[2:13:00] couch

[2:13:05] testimony
[2:13:07] she said if i'm not mistaken he says

[2:13:12] fellowships
