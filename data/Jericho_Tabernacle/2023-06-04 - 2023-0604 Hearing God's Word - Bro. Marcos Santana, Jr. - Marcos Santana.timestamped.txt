[48:24] words from the trip that we had
[48:27] I'm going to try and steal some minutes
[48:29] before we get into the preaching
[48:33] and distract you a bit with these photos
[48:37] as we said we went to the city of San
[48:39] Jose California
[48:42] where the pastor there's a brother
[48:46] and we're blessed to go myself and my
[48:49] family

[49:10] there where we had Services Friday
[49:12] through Sunday
[49:16] beautiful Services
[49:18] you know one point million brother boys
[49:20] were really tired
[49:23] and you know we kind of had a joke
[49:25] between us
[49:32] you know this is taking us back to the
[49:34] 90s when it was church food church
[49:39] and you know maybe we got a little out
[49:41] of shape
[49:43] but it felt good to get back into that
[49:46] routine
[49:49] you know as soon as you're about to get
[49:51] tired it's time to go worship once again
[49:57] and the brothers did a good job of
[49:59] giving us some long-winded preachers
[50:05] like our brother Gerald Hughes when he
[50:07] came to visit us
[50:11] thank God our brother Emanuel had the
[50:13] blessing of interpreting that brother
[50:17] and then just when we're falling asleep
[50:20] at the end of the conventions
[50:24] God sent us a press
[50:29] if you want to hear about brother Fred
[50:31] you can ask our brother Victor Chavez Jr
[50:33] from last year
[50:37] he fell in love with how that brother
[50:40] ministers
[50:42] this is a Congolese brother from Africa
[50:46] who who who brother Johnny got to see
[50:49] how sweet and humble he is
[50:54] but the moment he steps behind that
[50:56] Pulpit
[50:59] you would think it's a completely
[51:01] different person
[51:04] just a firecracker on fire for the worse
[51:10] just when we started getting tired this
[51:12] brother woke us right up
[51:16] I'm looking here brother Boaz song
[51:21] you know we didn't go with any a
[51:23] commission to minister to interpret to
[51:26] sing nothing
[51:31] but we did prepare our youth and
[51:33] everyone to just always be ready
[51:39] so we took our instruments
[51:42] we took our song books
[51:44] we took our notes
[51:46] and we were just ready at God's
[51:49] disposition yes
[51:52] the brothers felt in their heart to use
[51:54] our brother Johnny and her brother boys
[52:01] forgive me I forgot to mention another
[52:03] brother that I just saw in the picture
[52:07] or if he's watching or he watches this
[52:09] stream in the future
[52:12] our brother Gerson Ponce also
[52:15] accompanied us on this trip
[52:18] and since there's no divisions here
[52:22] there's no my circle in your circle here
[52:26] is the circle of the body of Jesus
[52:29] Christ
[52:31] that brother came in to be a part of the
[52:34] Jericho Tabernacle youth is
[52:39] and all in one the Youth of the Bride of
[52:42] Jesus Christ
[52:46] so I don't want to exclude my brother
[52:47] Gerson
[52:49] but it fell on my lot to minister
[52:52] Saturday morning
[52:55] which also caught me by surprise
[52:59] brother Emmanuel interpreted myself
[53:01] interpreted
[53:06] all together we're saying representing
[53:08] Jericho Tabernacle two specials out
[53:10] there
[53:15] and if you see this video right here
[53:19] there were a total of three baptisms at
[53:21] the end of
[53:22] campism
[53:24] and honestly every service every Camp
[53:28] every every uh meetings
[53:33] that's the purpose
[53:35] and somebody might hear a word
[53:39] that they might hear a word from God
[53:41] they would touch their hearts
[53:45] they've never surrendered their lives to
[53:47] the almighties
[53:51] there is a God that can change their
[53:54] lives
[53:56] so the Waters of baptism were open for
[53:59] anyone during those meetings
[54:04] and and we had the victory
[54:08] there were three baptisms you know the
[54:11] brothers there are so sweet
[54:14] they made it known to me they didn't
[54:16] want us to leave without giving us a
[54:18] like a goodbye lunch is
[54:26] so they brought all the visiting
[54:28] ministers and the youth from the church
[54:32] and it was one of the hardest things
[54:34] ever just to say goodbye on Monday
[54:36] morning
[54:41] honestly I look back and it was like a
[54:43] glimpse of Eternity
[54:49] you know I would go to this group where
[54:51] Emmanuel was
[54:53] and then I'd get them ready to go
[54:57] and then I'd go find Boaz and Johnny
[54:59] with this little group here to get them
[55:01] ready to go
[55:05] and then I find our precious young
[55:08] sisters get ready to go
[55:11] and it seemed as soon as I spoke to one
[55:14] the other one was back into it again and
[55:16] back into it again
[55:22] you know one day we'll have that
[55:24] opportunity
[55:26] this opportunity but we don't have to
[55:28] say goodbye
[55:30] we don't have to say I'll see you next
[55:32] year
[55:34] I'll see you at the next
[55:36] campaign no if brother Emanuel wants to
[55:39] have Fellowship for all of eternities
[55:43] he can go and have fellowships
[55:48] if the sisters want to laugh and dance
[55:51] and rejoice
[55:54] they have an eternity to spend that time
[55:56] with each other
[56:00] it was just a beautiful feeling foreign
[56:18] [Music]
[56:27] he must have given us some Supernatural
[56:30] strength for the two drivers that drove
[56:33] Sovereign
[56:48] but truly it was a blessing
[56:52] like I said I don't want to Rob too much
[56:54] of the time
[56:56] but you know the people are so humble in
[56:59] San Jose
[57:02] and and everyone that went they
[57:05] expressed a little bit of that humility
[57:07] that they saw and they felt from these
[57:08] people
[57:13] my wife was telling me about a moment
[57:16] that she had with sister Rachel Alone um
[57:20] and our sister Rachel was just so broken
[57:22] down
[57:26] love that these brothers are projecting
[57:29] the humility that they're projecting
[57:33] and that how I believe the words were
[57:35] it's like no one is greater than the
[57:37] other yeah
[57:41] and you know if you would have seen the
[57:43] youth how they were in action is
[57:47] in every single service serving the
[57:50] people
[57:52] it was just something beautiful and I'm
[57:55] sure every single one adult and young
[57:57] they took something back with them
[58:02] and I hope at least for the group of us
[58:04] that went yes
[58:07] and a little bit of this testimony I'm
[58:09] sharing
[58:11] might we be able to apply some of that
[58:13] same love and energy and humility
[58:19] in this church camp that we're getting
[58:21] prepared foreign
[58:26] time where we're going to put ourselves
[58:27] aside
[58:30] where we're going to invite the guests
[58:36] for them to come and have a good time
[58:40] for them to see a smile on our face
[58:45] for them to see the love of God that we
[58:48] have to give them
[58:51] so they can see that God is truly there
[58:54] at Jericho Tabernacles
[58:58] there's a group of humble Believers
[59:00] there that love the Lord with all their
[59:02] hearts
[59:05] and that there are no barriers
[59:08] there are no divisions that we are all
[59:12] in that body of Christ
[59:15] forgive me I think I'm preaching now
[59:19] if I'd like to go ahead and get started
[59:22] now
[59:23] if we would all please stand for the
[59:25] reading of the words
[59:30] you'd all turn to the Book of John
[59:32] chapter eight
[59:36] and we're going to give this a message
[59:40] or this sermon this morning
[59:45] hearing God's voice
[59:49] plain and simple
[59:51] right to the point
[59:53] but so easy to miss
[59:58] you know sometimes it's not even
[1:00:00] complicated to miss this is
[1:00:04] but hearing God's voice
[1:00:07] if we jump down to verse 43
[1:00:10] it reads the same why do ye not
[1:00:14] understand my speech even because you
[1:00:17] cannot hear my word
[1:00:23] jump down to verse 47.
[1:00:27] he that is of God heareth God's words he
[1:00:32] therefore heareth him not because ye are
[1:00:35] not of God
[1:00:43] once again hearing God's voice
[1:00:52] this morning Father we're so grateful to
[1:00:54] be in your house Lord
[1:00:58] thankfully I've been able to return back
[1:01:00] from this trip
[1:01:03] we're also thankful father for the
[1:01:05] brothers that travel to the other
[1:01:06] meetings on Memorial weekend
[1:01:24] and now that we are all here gathered
[1:01:28] safe and sound we're here to hear of
[1:01:31] your word once again
[1:01:34] this morning Father I said you put me
[1:01:37] and my interpreter aside
[1:01:40] just take these small simple words and
[1:01:42] touch the heart of the listener says
[1:01:47] that if they can hear the voice of God
[1:01:49] this morning
[1:01:52] and it was something that they needed
[1:01:54] this morning
[1:01:57] they have the faith and courage to take
[1:02:00] actions
[1:02:05] and we place the service in your hands
[1:02:09] in the precious name of our Lord and
[1:02:11] Savior Jesus Christ
[1:02:14] amen amen you may be seated Brothers
[1:02:18] once again the title hearing God's voice
[1:02:24] we can just put it on the screen if they
[1:02:26] have it Revelations 3 20.
[1:02:31] just to add on to that importance of
[1:02:34] hearing God's voice
[1:02:38] a very deep scripture
[1:02:41] behold I stand at the door and knock
[1:02:46] If any man hear my voice
[1:02:50] and open the door
[1:02:52] I will come into him and sup with him
[1:02:59] it's so simple if we can just hear that
[1:03:02] voice
[1:03:04] we can open the door to him
[1:03:08] great things will begin to happen
[1:03:12] Hebrews 3 15. wow
[1:03:16] it is said
[1:03:19] today if you will hear his voice
[1:03:23] Harden not your heart
[1:03:27] as in the Rebellion
[1:03:30] so this morning if I could ask of
[1:03:32] anything from you
[1:03:35] it's just to Simply open up your
[1:03:37] spiritual ears a little bit
[1:03:41] and just hear the voice of God
[1:03:44] the voice of God is in me
[1:03:47] the voice of God is not my brother
[1:03:50] but the voice of God comes from God
[1:03:52] alone
[1:03:55] you know there's human studies
[1:03:58] about how many thoughts the brain has
[1:04:03] and it's it's debated it's around six
[1:04:06] thousand to seventy thousand thoughts a
[1:04:08] day
[1:04:11] and you know that's that's a lot of
[1:04:13] thoughts
[1:04:14] I probably couldn't tell you maybe a
[1:04:16] hundred thoughts that I have myself in a
[1:04:18] date
[1:04:22] so now whether 70 000 or 6 000.
[1:04:26] let's go to the Book of Genesis
[1:04:29] because let us remember what day and age
[1:04:31] we're living in today
[1:04:35] we know that in the last days
[1:04:39] it'll be like the days
[1:04:44] so in Genesis 6 5 it says
[1:04:48] that God saw the wickedness of men and
[1:04:50] women on the earth
[1:04:55] and it was great
[1:04:59] it was great not great as in good
[1:05:03] as a number was a lot
[1:05:08] it says that every imagination of their
[1:05:11] thoughts was on evil continually
[1:05:20] so 70 000 thoughts in a day
[1:05:25] and every single one of those were evil
[1:05:30] no I I don't I don't want to make anyone
[1:05:33] feel bad
[1:05:35] but I know everyone in here is born in
[1:05:38] sins
[1:05:41] and we still battle this flesh
[1:05:44] and when we're not a hundred percent
[1:05:47] consecrated and anointed
[1:05:52] a lot of those 70 000 thoughts are evil
[1:05:57] because we're in the same days
[1:06:03] whether you want to believe it or not
[1:06:05] evil thoughts are going through your
[1:06:07] mind all the time
[1:06:12] thank God some of us are born again
[1:06:17] God some of us have received the Holy
[1:06:18] ghosts
[1:06:21] we have a weapon to combat those
[1:06:24] thoughts
[1:06:27] but we're still in the flesh
[1:06:30] and all thoughts have only two places to
[1:06:34] come from
[1:06:40] you know I really enjoyed the message on
[1:06:43] Friday the brother Eli preached
[1:06:46] you know if a young person wasn't paying
[1:06:49] attention
[1:06:51] I feel sorry for them
[1:06:54] I'll tell you go listen to that message
[1:06:56] over and over again
[1:07:00] because it almost seemed like brother
[1:07:02] Eli had it out for this specific demon
[1:07:04] from hell
[1:07:05] is
[1:07:11] this little thing right here
[1:07:13] you know and and I love that he was
[1:07:15] talking about Satan's devices
[1:07:29] I personally think it's it's probably
[1:07:31] the strongest device that he's perverted
[1:07:33] and used to attack us
[1:07:40] you know I was just thinking and kind of
[1:07:43] being funny to myself
[1:07:46] I'll say you know what Satan don't even
[1:07:48] got to work that hard anymore
[1:07:51] you know he don't have to be try to be
[1:07:54] everywhere at once trying to attack us
[1:07:55] all at the same time
[1:08:00] the Legion of demons that is within this
[1:08:04] device
[1:08:06] some of us we sleep with it next to our
[1:08:09] pillows
[1:08:13] some of us tuck it inside of our
[1:08:15] clothing all day long
[1:08:20] other of us can't wait to our kids to
[1:08:23] get of age so we can get them that
[1:08:24] Legion of demons
[1:08:31] Satan don't even need to work on us no
[1:08:34] more
[1:08:37] because the access to hell is on us
[1:08:40] every single day
[1:08:43] and going back to thoughts I think I
[1:08:47] could say the majority of our thoughts
[1:08:51] because of how dependent we are on this
[1:08:53] thing right here
[1:08:57] the things we like and dislike come from
[1:08:59] here
[1:09:02] the way we tend to reason comes from
[1:09:04] right there
[1:09:07] the the the actions that we take are
[1:09:10] from right there
[1:09:12] because of what we see what we're here
[1:09:27] those demons have a heavy effect on our
[1:09:30] lives
[1:09:34] I'm so sorry I forgot to give the
[1:09:36] brothers in the back my quotes this
[1:09:38] morning
[1:09:39] [Music]
[1:09:41] in the message in 1955
[1:09:47] brother Brandon says never permit a
[1:09:49] negative thought to come in your mind if
[1:09:51] you can help it
[1:09:57] when it starts don't entertain it
[1:10:02] I got 70 000 that I can get
[1:10:07] but it's my job just to not entertain it
[1:10:10] is
[1:10:12] we can't help the pop-ups
[1:10:16] we can't help the advertisements
[1:10:20] but we can help if we click that button
[1:10:24] to go watch whatever's behind that
[1:10:25] foreign
[1:11:07] and you know sometimes it is hard to
[1:11:10] catch when God is trying to talk to us
[1:11:15] that happens to me so
[1:11:29] he was studying a topic
[1:11:32] and when he was so into his word and
[1:11:35] into that prayer
[1:11:39] and he didn't even know he was preaching
[1:11:41] to me
[1:11:43] he said brother I don't know when I was
[1:11:45] so into my word
[1:11:48] and it might be a snippet for what he's
[1:11:50] going to bring us at some point
[1:11:53] he said there's a a circle of protection
[1:11:59] that's around you
[1:12:02] when you're in connection with God
[1:12:04] and he said and the moment that I
[1:12:07] stopped is
[1:12:08] do you know how hard it was for me to
[1:12:11] get back into that Circle so
[1:12:16] so it's a state that we need to be in
[1:12:19] constant connection with God
[1:12:24] so therefore there are moments where we
[1:12:26] don't hear him we we don't follow what
[1:12:28] he's trying to tell us
[1:12:32] so since we all know in the beginning
[1:12:34] was the word
[1:12:37] the word had power to create to
[1:12:39] transform the hill
[1:12:44] then since the beginning
[1:12:47] Satan's main goal with every one of us
[1:12:52] was just to get us to not listen to the
[1:12:56] words
[1:12:58] and like my brother said to destroy us
[1:13:02] because when we don't listen to that
[1:13:04] word
[1:13:05] we don't obey that word and apply that
[1:13:08] word in our lives
[1:13:11] we're going to get into problems
[1:13:14] we were not within connection or are in
[1:13:17] tune with that word
[1:13:20] you know plain and simple
[1:13:22] if he's trying to speak to us
[1:13:26] and we're not hearing that voice that
[1:13:28] word
[1:13:30] then exactly what my brother said we're
[1:13:32] destroyed
[1:13:36] you're going to be defeated
[1:13:39] we know we're more than conquerors with
[1:13:42] the words
[1:13:44] we know we have eternal life with the
[1:13:46] words
[1:13:47] we know we have weapons against the
[1:13:50] enemy with the words
[1:13:54] but take away that word
[1:13:57] and now you are defeated
[1:14:00] now on top of that not only just being
[1:14:04] defeated
[1:14:05] if Satan he can replace the words
[1:14:10] if he can substitute the words
[1:14:13] and then we find ourselves in our daily
[1:14:15] walk
[1:14:17] and we're taking heed to that word that
[1:14:19] we heard
[1:14:21] and we're listening and following that
[1:14:24] word that we heard
[1:14:26] now we're deceived and we're defeated
[1:14:31] because we've been wrongfully convinced
[1:14:33] of the wrong word
[1:14:37] now it sounds very drastic for the
[1:14:40] Christians
[1:14:43] I feel like this message is it is for
[1:14:45] the Christian this morning
[1:14:49] the person out there
[1:14:51] there's many voices they could listen to
[1:14:55] there's plenty of word they can listen
[1:14:57] to
[1:14:58] I'm going to say like this good word
[1:15:00] that they can listen
[1:15:03] educational word motivational words
[1:15:08] businessman's words political words
[1:15:12] but for us there's only one word that
[1:15:14] we're trying to listen to
[1:15:17] and that's the word of God yes the one
[1:15:22] that saved us the one that transformed
[1:15:24] us and the one that's going to take us
[1:15:27] to that Eternal destination
[1:15:30] but for us as the Christians
[1:15:34] say it might be a little different how
[1:15:36] he tends to get to it
[1:15:41] if you're now a Christian
[1:15:43] you're now born again
[1:15:46] you now have been baptized
[1:15:48] he's not going to come to you with with
[1:15:51] with uh with lust and those things
[1:15:55] we've already come out of that
[1:15:58] we've come up higher than that
[1:16:01] if he's got to get a Son of God
[1:16:05] you always got to get a daughter of God
[1:16:08] he's got to be a little more slick and
[1:16:10] use the word of God
[1:16:13] he's got to find a way to twist it just
[1:16:16] a little
[1:16:19] because if you take uh those that
[1:16:22] believe in uh
[1:16:24] those that believe that the new name of
[1:16:26] Jesus Christ is William Branham
[1:16:29] William Branham and they baptized in the
[1:16:32] name of William Brown William Branham if
[1:16:35] you talk to them they have a deep
[1:16:36] conviction
[1:16:39] and you know where they got that from
[1:16:42] right here you know where else they got
[1:16:45] that from
[1:16:48] the message so if Satan's gonna do
[1:16:51] anything to stumble us
[1:16:54] or give us a voice to hear that we think
[1:16:57] is
[1:17:00] he's gonna have to use a little bit of
[1:17:03] that word to mix it up
[1:17:06] have you ever found yourself where you
[1:17:08] want to listen to a message
[1:17:11] you just want to read your Bible
[1:17:14] you want to pray a little bit more
[1:17:17] you want to have a family altar with
[1:17:19] your children
[1:17:21] but it seems like something always
[1:17:53] the young people they had this this pole
[1:17:56] that was pulling them to get into prayer
[1:18:01] and then the thought came they forgot
[1:18:04] they have a big assignment they need to
[1:18:05] turn in tomorrow
[1:18:09] yeah so these are just reasons
[1:18:13] these are just reasons that they are
[1:18:15] valid
[1:18:17] they're not evil reasons you didn't stop
[1:18:21] reading to go do something bad
[1:18:24] you didn't stop praying because there
[1:18:26] was a chat on the youth chat or the
[1:18:28] women's chat
[1:18:32] and something bad came about from that
[1:18:36] no it was good things
[1:18:39] positive things but it was just a split
[1:18:42] second to change the course of what God
[1:18:44] had for you
[1:18:48] that in that exact moment God wanted you
[1:18:51] to get into prayer
[1:18:54] at that exact moment God wanted you to
[1:18:57] turn on The Voice Radio
[1:19:02] because there was a voice and he was
[1:19:04] trying to talk to you get you to hear
[1:19:06] him
[1:19:09] but Satan just happened to get in the
[1:19:12] way
[1:19:13] just to get us a little attitude
[1:19:19] get us a little out of sync
[1:19:22] and Miss what God
[1:19:31] a little bit of Revelation you were
[1:19:33] seeking for in your life
[1:19:36] but for a split second Satan turned you
[1:19:39] away
[1:19:41] you know if you're if you're walking
[1:19:43] down the road
[1:19:45] and then it's let's just say it's 10
[1:19:47] miles down the road
[1:19:51] if you change that course by one degree
[1:19:55] you might walk maybe two three miles and
[1:19:58] feel like you're on course
[1:20:02] but you get down to seven eight nine ten
[1:20:05] miles down the road
[1:20:10] you're going to be so far from the road
[1:20:15] wondering where did I go wrong
[1:20:18] what was I listening to what was I doing
[1:20:22] I got off the way
[1:21:00] he says what if the sick people here
[1:21:02] tonight would begin to think
[1:21:08] God is God God is yours if he isn't then
[1:21:15] why serve him
[1:21:16] if God is in God
[1:21:19] we might as well leave
[1:21:21] you know the NBA finals are going on
[1:21:24] right now foreign
[1:22:13] because this church is in tune with God
[1:22:18] he says something's going to take place
[1:22:22] and there's nothing that's going to stop
[1:22:27] you know being in tune with God
[1:22:31] I don't know if anybody's familiar with
[1:22:33] the artist James Brown
[1:22:35] artista James Brown you know if you are
[1:22:38] you don't got to be too religious this
[1:22:39] morning
[1:22:42] he's a singer from the 40s 50s 60s 70s
[1:22:48] he was a great singer
[1:22:51] he was so in sync with his music
[1:22:53] Elizabeth
[1:22:56] with the instruments the songs the
[1:22:58] backup singers everything
[1:23:03] and he was revered for being ahead of
[1:23:06] his time in the mute speaking about
[1:23:08] music
[1:23:13] and he was so in tune with his music
[1:23:19] that as the concert was going on
[1:23:23] if a single person got one note off
[1:23:27] or was delayed by half a second or a
[1:23:30] quarter of a second
[1:23:33] in the middle of dancing and singing
[1:23:38] he'll look over at the saxophone player
[1:23:42] and give them that little look and they
[1:23:46] knew that they were going to get a
[1:23:47] hundred dollars taken off of their
[1:23:48] checks
[1:23:51] that's how in tune he was
[1:23:55] so since nobody raised their hand
[1:23:58] is anybody familiar with Michael Jackson
[1:24:00] Michael Jackson amen God bless you if
[1:24:03] you listen Michael Jackson Michael
[1:24:05] Jackson also another revered man in in
[1:24:08] the music industry
[1:24:13] I believe in pop music I think it is
[1:24:16] also who was so obsessed and so in tune
[1:24:19] with music
[1:24:23] with every aspect of Melody the time in
[1:24:26] everything
[1:24:28] just like James Brown who happened to be
[1:24:31] his Idol
[1:24:33] when when there was one occasion
[1:24:37] we're a music director and the singers
[1:24:41] they didn't end the song exactly where
[1:24:44] it was supposed to end
[1:24:48] and in the middle of him singing
[1:24:51] without anyone even noticing
[1:25:05] and no one noticed and the performance
[1:25:08] kept going on
[1:25:11] now those are just examples to see when
[1:25:13] you're so in tune with something
[1:25:18] now brother Johnny forgive me
[1:25:21] I think we entered a new level of love
[1:25:24] and Brotherhood my brother
[1:25:29] I feel the same way like my brother
[1:25:31] Victor and Josh on our last trip
[1:25:36] so I might pick on you a little bit
[1:25:38] right now
[1:25:40] alien how many know brother Johnny is an
[1:25:43] amazing song leader
[1:25:46] man I've heard him in Camp he's God has
[1:25:49] used him tremendously
[1:25:53] I used to watch him years ago when he
[1:25:55] was songly he was tremendous
[1:25:59] and even here God has used him in a
[1:26:02] tremendous way
[1:26:04] because he's yielded the gift that came
[1:26:07] from God
[1:26:09] that God might use it through him
[1:26:13] as just a vessel surrender to him
[1:26:18] for the benefit of his people
[1:26:21] you know brother Johnny can be up here
[1:26:24] and and can look at Sister Sarah
[1:26:27] and within that brotherly connection
[1:26:30] they have yes
[1:26:32] give her this some kind of sign to get
[1:26:34] her to play a certain way
[1:26:37] and for our younger musicians down here
[1:26:41] you give a little bit of a Stern looks
[1:26:44] in this direction to these young sisters
[1:26:45] playing here
[1:26:48] but they catch on and they start playing
[1:26:51] the way he needs it
[1:26:54] and then here I am tucked away trying to
[1:26:57] hide from everybody
[1:27:00] right brother Josh that's how we do it
[1:27:03] we're we're we're shy individuals
[1:28:05] but he's feeling and as that spirit is
[1:28:07] going up and down those eyes
[1:28:12] and by his administration
[1:28:15] by his in tune guys
[1:28:19] the Lord can operate on his people
[1:28:24] the same thing with James Brown James
[1:28:27] Brown the same thing with Michael
[1:28:28] Jackson Michael Jackson they want
[1:28:31] Perfection
[1:28:32] for worship
[1:28:34] for self-worship
[1:28:37] and the worship of
[1:28:39] satanas because Satan also has his song
[1:28:42] leaders
[1:28:44] many times there's so much better than
[1:28:46] us
[1:28:48] but God also wants Perfection
[1:28:51] we we strive to be perfect for God
[1:28:56] though we know we will never be perfect
[1:28:59] but there's a perfect one that died on
[1:29:02] the cross for us
[1:29:04] and because that perfect one lives in us
[1:29:09] we can be perfect in his eyes
[1:29:13] so I'm not saying we need to sing
[1:29:15] perfect
[1:29:16] foreign
[1:30:14] [Music]
[1:30:29] and all the young ones that are in
[1:30:31] training right now
[1:30:34] we're all just working together for the
[1:30:37] honor and glory of God
[1:30:40] just trying to give him the best of our
[1:30:42] praise and the best of our worship
[1:30:47] that synchronization
[1:30:50] that's talking about the praise and
[1:30:53] worship Department
[1:30:56] in the church and in your personal life
[1:31:00] but what about in The Prayer Department
[1:31:02] of your life
[1:31:05] some people are probably really strong
[1:31:10] but some people are probably really weak
[1:31:14] you might find yourself somewhere in the
[1:31:16] middle
[1:31:18] I don't know the life of prayer you have
[1:31:20] behind closed doors
[1:31:24] but if I had to guess
[1:31:27] like they say I'm gonna take a wild
[1:31:29] guess
[1:31:31] that group they personas they make it
[1:31:35] here on
[1:31:36] Wednesdays they make it here on that
[1:31:38] Friday
[1:31:39] make it here on Sunday okay
[1:31:42] and they make it here on
[1:31:46] Mondays I'm gonna guess that they have a
[1:31:48] pretty strong life of prayer
[1:31:52] and thank God for them
[1:31:55] we have examples in those those that are
[1:31:58] Prayer Warriors of this church
[1:32:02] they're probably there Monday praying
[1:32:04] for the Wednesday service
[1:32:08] praying for a Friday in our Sunday
[1:32:10] service
[1:32:12] you know and and say and he hates that
[1:32:15] is
[1:32:17] he says one thing he doesn't want is for
[1:32:19] us to have a life of prayer
[1:32:23] maybe we're not all prayed up personally
[1:32:28] no but maybe the brother sister next to
[1:32:30] you has been praying all week long
[1:32:36] and that's the beauty because we are a
[1:32:38] family
[1:32:40] within the bride family
[1:32:44] within the family of Christ
[1:32:47] where somebody praying for the pastors
[1:32:51] somebody's praying for the preacher
[1:32:54] somebody's praying for that petition
[1:32:56] that you came up here to be prayed for
[1:33:00] so you're not alone
[1:33:03] the goal is to get a stronger prayer
[1:33:06] life for God
[1:33:10] but if it helps you this morning
[1:33:14] you're not alone this morning
[1:33:26] as much as he's been studying us
[1:33:29] together you know I love when preachers
[1:33:32] say that he's scared of you
[1:33:37] because he can never equal up to you
[1:33:41] he's inferior to you and he knows what
[1:33:45] we're capable of
[1:33:47] he knows what power we have
[1:33:50] he knows that when we are in tune with
[1:33:53] this word
[1:33:55] oh it's game over for Satan yes
[1:33:59] so his goal is to achieve that we don't
[1:34:02] hear the word of God
[1:34:07] where we're hearing this voice where
[1:34:09] we're hearing his words
[1:34:12] because he knows it's forming a stronger
[1:34:15] bond with God
[1:34:19] a bigger connection with God
[1:34:23] where we now have access to the spoken
[1:34:25] word powers
[1:34:29] where we can speak our healing into
[1:34:31] existence
[1:34:33] where we can speak our husband and
[1:34:36] wife's salvation into existence
[1:34:40] well you can speak anything into
[1:34:43] existence
[1:34:45] that's why Satan is trying at all costs
[1:34:50] to try and destroy your prayer life
[1:34:54] because that's where you can get into
[1:34:57] connection with God
[1:34:59] that's where you start to hear God's
[1:35:02] voice
[1:35:04] and you recognize God's voice
[1:35:08] you talk to somebody on the street
[1:35:11] you meet them at the grocery store
[1:35:14] I don't know the conversation leads you
[1:35:29] your person
[1:35:31] and then a few months down the road
[1:35:35] you run into that person again
[1:35:38] and they're trying to talk to you yes
[1:35:41] you don't remember me this is
[1:35:45] [Music]
[1:35:48] you tell me how your wife loves to make
[1:35:50] it what they said cilantro and all these
[1:35:53] things
[1:35:57] oh I'm so sorry I I don't recognize you
[1:36:00] I don't know who you are
[1:36:02] [Music]
[1:36:03] if we're not in constant prayer with God
[1:36:08] if we're not in constant fellowship with
[1:36:10] God
[1:36:12] a person who we claim is our friend
[1:36:16] who is our lover who is our everything
[1:36:20] when we don't talk to him for months and
[1:36:23] months and months
[1:36:26] how are you going to know the voice of
[1:36:28] God when he speaks to you
[1:36:31] Diabla it you can't no puedes it's been
[1:36:36] so long
[1:36:37] you forgot what it looks like
[1:36:39] you forgot what it sounds like
[1:36:42] you forgot what it feels like to get
[1:36:45] some loves
[1:36:49] because we don't have a strong life of
[1:36:51] prayer
[1:36:54] says these simple words
[1:36:57] in the message testimony
[1:37:00] let everything else be secondary but
[1:37:04] your prayer life
[1:37:10] everything is in second place
[1:37:14] and in first place
[1:37:17] is my life of prayer
[1:37:21] he says stay right there with him
[1:37:26] all the time
[1:37:28] not some of the times
[1:37:31] portion of the time
[1:37:33] but all the time
[1:37:35] let us strive to pray with him all the
[1:37:38] time
[1:37:41] our business let's put a second
[1:37:44] our job
[1:37:47] our career let's put a second
[1:38:00] [Music]
[1:38:19] and we all as message Believers we know
[1:38:22] this already
[1:38:24] you know it's not flesh and blood that
[1:38:27] we fight with
[1:38:29] if it was Flesh and Blood
[1:38:34] I can just get rid of my brother
[1:38:36] Emmanuel and I solved my problems
[1:38:40] if it was that easy I can get rid of
[1:38:43] this Deacon that I don't like in problem
[1:38:44] solve foreign
[1:39:21] to think why I can't stand brother
[1:39:23] Emanuel
[1:39:25] why did he have to do what he did to me
[1:39:29] why did they make this decision in that
[1:39:31] decision
[1:39:34] because it's invisible
[1:39:36] its powers in The Invisible Realms
[1:39:41] you know one of the things I love about
[1:39:43] Arizona
[1:39:45] are the gun laws here in Arizona
[1:39:49] and and you know the freedom to carry
[1:39:53] you don't get that in California
[1:39:56] the freedom to go to the store and walk
[1:39:58] out five minutes later with a gun you
[1:40:00] don't get that in California
[1:40:05] the freedom to go out shooting into the
[1:40:08] field you don't get that in California
[1:40:12] you know if brother o ever got to the
[1:40:15] point
[1:40:17] where where he needed individuals to
[1:40:19] start caring in church
[1:40:24] I might just be one of the first ones to
[1:40:26] sign up
[1:40:28] you know thank God that we don't need
[1:40:31] that
[1:40:32] but I'ma tell you even in the United
[1:40:34] States there are places that they do
[1:40:36] need that
[1:40:40] and if you talk to our Elder brothers
[1:40:42] that have traveled the world
[1:40:46] there are churches of the message that
[1:40:48] their deacons are are carrying those
[1:40:50] firearms
[1:40:54] and I might know one or two brothers
[1:40:56] they'll probably sign up right along
[1:40:58] with me
[1:41:01] but you know if the devil was just
[1:41:04] walking around
[1:41:05] and he just hit the corner on Rozier
[1:41:10] and this was a flesh and blood Affair
[1:41:13] yes
[1:41:14] and I see them all red like the world
[1:41:16] paints
[1:41:19] with the long old nasty tail that he's
[1:41:22] got
[1:41:24] and that spear looking thing that he
[1:41:26] carries
[1:41:27] you know we know that's not safe but if
[1:41:31] that devil were to walk by
[1:41:33] Foreign
[1:41:38] I would shoot him so fast
[1:41:42] I would drop him dead in his footsteps
[1:41:46] but we know that's not how it operates
[1:41:50] we can't shoot the devil much more than
[1:41:52] we can shoot our brothers
[1:41:56] because there can be just momentary
[1:41:59] anointings upon each and every one of us
[1:42:06] just like Peter momentarily anointed
[1:42:11] to say something that was contrary to
[1:42:14] the word of God
[1:42:17] for Jesus to say get behind me
[1:42:22] get out of here
[1:42:24] we don't want you here and he left
[1:42:27] because it's it's it's an invisible
[1:42:30] realm
[1:42:32] it's a battle in the mind
[1:42:34] and that's how he speaks to us in the
[1:42:37] minds
[1:42:39] he's in the church he wants to be
[1:42:42] worshiped like God in the church
[1:42:45] we hear it all the time the wolf in
[1:42:47] sheep's clothing
[1:43:46] he's so similar to the truth
[1:43:58] [Music]
[1:44:01] you know you just gotta have that
[1:44:03] connection with God
[1:44:06] if you're not in tune
[1:44:08] if you don't have the ability to
[1:44:10] recognize God's voice
[1:44:17] not with some crazy Street terminology
[1:44:23] but with the same word
[1:44:27] and we'll hear what we think is God's
[1:44:30] voice
[1:44:33] because it sounds like his voice
[1:44:36] looks like his voice it acts like his
[1:44:39] voice
[1:44:40] therefore we need to be in our word
[1:44:42] daily
[1:44:45] and we can identify that voice
[1:44:49] because God speaks to us all in many
[1:44:51] different ways
[1:44:55] like two or three times already
[1:44:58] [Music]
[1:45:00] some of us God speaks to dreams
[1:45:03] oh there's God literally has an audible
[1:45:06] voice that he speaks to us
[1:45:11] though I've noticed the way God speaks
[1:45:13] to our brothers
[1:45:16] he'll pull over on the middle of the
[1:45:18] road and start crying and praying
[1:45:23] the moments where I find him talking to
[1:45:26] me
[1:45:27] habla it's usually in the barbershop
[1:45:31] and I like to cut hair with the hat yeah
[1:45:35] and I pull my head nice and low
[1:45:39] and I have something planned in my ears
[1:45:43] and it just starts talking to me and
[1:45:45] talking to me
[1:45:47] and a sermon a preaching music whatever
[1:45:49] the case may be
[1:45:53] and Tears start flowing from my face
[1:45:57] and I put it down low
[1:46:00] so the client doesn't see me
[1:46:02] the one I'm cutting this here or the
[1:46:05] ones waiting
[1:46:08] so that discreetly I can just wipe
[1:46:10] myself off and keep on working
[1:46:15] however he speaks to you
[1:46:19] stay in tune with God
[1:46:23] don't ever lose that recognition of that
[1:46:26] voice that wants to speak to you
[1:46:31] brother Brandon says in the message
[1:46:34] amazing title of a message
[1:46:39] thirsting for life
[1:46:41] is anybody thirsty for life this morning
[1:46:45] he says when he cuts your prayer life
[1:47:02] he says that's right
[1:47:04] when he cuts that thirst off of you
[1:47:09] and he perverts it into things of the
[1:47:13] world
[1:47:16] we're talking to us
[1:47:20] outside
[1:47:22] he might not pervert you back to drugs
[1:47:27] he's not perverting you into adultery
[1:47:29] from your husband or wife
[1:47:34] but he's taken you one degree off the
[1:47:37] road
[1:47:40] he perverts you one degree into the
[1:47:43] things of the world
[1:47:46] and he's got you right where he
[1:47:51] he will let you gobble along here
[1:47:55] until you get to a certain place
[1:47:58] and then you crash your life right
[1:48:01] without God
[1:48:04] we're going to crash our life into
[1:48:07] misery without God
[1:48:11] that's why prayer is so important
[1:48:16] I'm not preaching you because I'm some
[1:48:19] great prayer warriors
[1:48:23] you know there's two types of glass
[1:48:26] there's the glass in the window
[1:48:29] yeah I could stand here and be looking
[1:48:31] at every one of you all this morning
[1:48:34] point the finger to everyone this
[1:48:36] morning
[1:48:38] and there's the glass in the mirror
[1:48:43] that that one when I look at it
[1:48:45] I'm looking at myself I'm preaching
[1:48:57] I need to learn to hear his voice every
[1:49:00] second of my life
[1:49:03] because I've got to put him first in
[1:49:06] everything else seconds
[1:49:09] we pray for our burdens foreign
[1:49:48] so in tune that you recognize his
[1:49:51] response
[1:49:54] you know sometimes we just have to pray
[1:49:57] ourselves through the trials
[1:50:00] how many times have we heard brother
[1:50:02] Branham cry out in his messages
[1:50:07] what happened to those all night prayer
[1:50:09] services
[1:50:12] what happened to those prayer revivals
[1:50:18] what happened to that brother or sister
[1:50:20] that would be here and pray till after
[1:50:22] everyone's gone out the building
[1:50:28] that's somebody trying to pray their way
[1:50:31] through the trials
[1:50:34] they're trying to fight to get through
[1:50:36] that burden
[1:50:38] you know if you were stuck in a car
[1:50:40] falling into the ocean
[1:50:45] you wouldn't just grab the handle and
[1:50:47] quit
[1:50:55] you grab something to break the window
[1:50:58] on your side
[1:51:01] to obtain your Liberty your deliverance
[1:51:07] so why when we pray we can't fight our
[1:51:10] way through the Deliverance
[1:51:14] fight our way out of the escape from the
[1:51:17] hold of
[1:51:18] satanas
[1:51:22] pray to the point where we can get that
[1:51:25] response from God
[1:51:29] and I think of the older sisters that
[1:51:32] come out here and shed their tears
[1:51:36] you know when they're here for 20 30 40
[1:51:39] minutes praying
[1:51:42] if God wanted to and it's his will
[1:51:46] when they pray for their husband or
[1:51:48] their children
[1:51:50] they could come running through that
[1:51:52] door surrendering their lives
[1:51:57] because we have living testimonies of
[1:51:59] that
[1:52:01] but when you understand you can identify
[1:52:04] the voice of God
[1:52:08] when that older sister when that mother
[1:52:10] gets up
[1:52:13] she has heard from God himself
[1:52:18] and she knows that it's already done
[1:52:22] the job is finished
[1:52:24] my children are going to be okay
[1:52:26] my husband's gonna be okay my wife's
[1:52:30] gonna be okay
[1:52:31] because they heard the voice of God
[1:52:34] they don't gotta see it they don't gotta
[1:52:37] feel it they're just having faith in
[1:52:40] that voice
[1:52:42] and when they leave here
[1:52:45] they profess it over and over again
[1:52:52] now many people wonder what happens when
[1:52:55] they're healed we say uh
[1:52:59] and the message letting off the pressure
[1:53:03] after a while that they don't feel that
[1:53:05] way
[1:53:08] because but it's because when the prayer
[1:53:11] is being made
[1:53:13] when you're up here and they're praying
[1:53:16] for you
[1:53:18] and the presence of the Lord is with you
[1:53:22] faith
[1:53:25] and when the faith then leaves
[1:53:29] when you live here
[1:53:31] you go home
[1:53:33] you battle the rest of the week
[1:53:37] when the faith leaves
[1:53:43] something has to happen to you
[1:53:47] you must remain with that phase
[1:53:52] don't never let that Faith leave you
[1:53:56] just always remember
[1:53:59] that God has answered your prayers
[1:54:05] you heard from God
[1:54:07] he gave you his word he gave you his
[1:54:11] promise so God has already answered
[1:54:15] he says it's his words he cannot go back
[1:54:19] on that
[1:54:22] he must keep his word
[1:54:26] we're gonna now be closing if the
[1:54:28] musicians would like to come forward
[1:54:33] you know the devil's watching and he's
[1:54:36] watching right now
[1:54:37] he's going to be watching in the morning
[1:54:39] and in the evening
[1:54:42] and we're taught to always profess our
[1:54:45] healing
[1:54:48] profess your Victory
[1:54:51] that's your deliverance
[1:54:54] he's in control he's taking his load and
[1:54:57] put it on his back
[1:55:02] God's word said it's a finished work
[1:55:06] my word is saying that it's a Finnish
[1:55:09] word
[1:55:10] then the supernatural word is gonna make
[1:55:13] it a finished work
[1:55:17] the blind man in the barber chairs
[1:55:22] over and over and over again
[1:55:26] and what happened to him
[1:55:28] the time came where he had so much faith
[1:55:45] there's power in the words that we speak
[1:55:49] don't don't speak your sufferings
[1:55:52] and all the struggles that you're going
[1:55:55] through
[1:55:56] and find yourself complaining and
[1:55:59] complaining and complaining
[1:56:02] because Satan is going to capitalize on
[1:56:05] that
[1:56:07] oh he wants to complain about what's
[1:56:09] going on in his life
[1:56:12] I'm gonna go ahead and give him a little
[1:56:14] bit more to complain about
[1:56:16] and I'm gonna put him deeper in that
[1:56:18] hole
[1:56:19] let us instead use our words
[1:56:23] and if we're going to speak about our
[1:56:25] burdens and our problems
[1:56:29] let us profess it with the name of Jesus
[1:56:32] Christ attack
[1:57:01] that's tacked on to what I'm asking
[1:57:04] foreign
[1:57:32] Jesus he's looking at your giant big
[1:57:35] brother standing behind you
[1:57:38] because there's a life behind the name
[1:57:43] that's the name of Jesus Christ
[1:57:47] [Music]
[1:57:50] brother Branham says decent amount of
[1:57:53] Branham
[1:57:54] our Eternal destination
[1:57:58] eterno is not altogether determined
[1:58:02] by what we see and by what we're here
[1:58:07] do you understand that your Eternal
[1:58:09] destination is
[1:58:12] not determined by what you can see with
[1:58:15] these eyes
[1:58:17] so what you hear with these years
[1:58:20] but it's determined on what discernment
[1:58:24] we have
[1:58:27] what we see and of what we hear
[1:58:32] if you discern that those voices that
[1:58:34] come to you
[1:58:38] are not of God
[1:58:40] then strive to get them out of your head
[1:58:45] but if you can discern
[1:58:48] that this is a sound word
[1:58:52] it's a certain word
[1:58:55] it's a promise word
[1:58:58] then you can discern um
[1:59:01] this is the voice of God
[1:59:04] this is him speaking to me
[1:59:08] [Music]
[1:59:18] [Music]
[1:59:29] a powerful service that morning
[1:59:33] but when that service was over
[1:59:36] everybody had to go home
[1:59:39] and Jesus told his disciples
[1:59:42] don't meet me on the other side of that
[1:59:44] of water
[1:59:48] service is going to end here today
[1:59:51] and you're going to have to leave here
[1:59:53] on your boat
[1:59:56] Jesus went to pray Jesus and the
[1:59:59] disciples out on that water
[2:00:02] there were strong wins they came
[2:00:06] those heavy storms they were
[2:00:12] [Music]

[2:02:11] the waves of discouragement
[2:02:14] things that you've been going through
[2:02:17] they start coming back and thoughts over
[2:02:20] and over and over in your mind
[2:02:24] but the words that Peter says
[2:02:29] anyone can say those words
[2:02:33] anybody can say those words this morning
[2:02:39] help me
[2:02:41] save me he shouted it over and over
[2:02:45] again
[2:02:47] and he extends
[2:02:50] don't doubt me my son
[2:02:56] here come I'll take you in my arms
[2:03:06] just call on the name of Jesus Christ
[2:03:12] this morning
[2:03:21] but his voice and if it's calling you
[2:03:25] you can answer to that girl
[2:03:28] he's here
[2:03:32] when they made it to shore
[2:03:35] the people at that land
[2:03:38] they recognize
[2:03:41] Jesus
[2:03:56] did you know
[2:03:58] that the woman with the bloody shoes
[2:04:01] was not the only one that had that
[2:04:04] touched his garments
[2:04:07] the Bible says
[2:04:09] that everyone that was sick on that land
[2:04:15] they touched the Hem of His Garden
[2:04:19] they rushed to the altar of Jesus
[2:04:22] Christ
[2:04:29] they were all healed that night
[2:04:33] you can grab the Hem of His Garment this
[2:04:36] morning
[2:04:38] it wasn't just one woman
