be able to see each and every single one of you is amen tonight we have a very beautiful service we you know we have a very special very special people in our church and everybody is special everybody has its own grain of sand [Music] and God has dealt with us separately and individually individuals and God has given us a testimony it's nice to hear the young people give their testimony but it's so nice when you have someone that's been in the message for many many years I want you young people to notice we have Elders in our church and they have been here with the gospel for many years don't you love the Lord man let's let's open our scripture first Timothy chapter 5 verse 1. for those who know their Bibles and for those who do not know the scriptures very well this is the Apostle Paul writing to the to a young man you know he's writing a letter to a young persona and I want you to notice what the Apostle Paul is telling this young man rebuke not an elder but entreat him as a father and the younger man as Brethren this is the Elder woman as mothers the younger sisters with all Purity let's bow our heads we come Lord approaching your throne of mercy and Grace at this hour we thank you for the message we thank you for your word and Lord we thank you for the life that you have given us now Lord as we're going to speak for a few moments Lord may you open up our spiritual ears and Lord may we able to understand the scriptures or we might be able to read it but you're the one who can give the Revelation and Lord father may we place this service in your hands name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen you may take your seats real quickly I'm not going to take too much of your time um I want you to notice what the Apostle Paul just told Timothy said he says don't rebuke an elder he said no reprendas but in the fourth chapter on the 12th verse Pastor Paul tells Timothy Mateo let no man despise thy youth in other words don't let nobody make you any different because you're younger trying to serve the Lord and there he is encouraging and once he's done saying those encouraging words because sometimes the younger folks and I say this for myself I remember my uncle in [Music] I want you to tell me that you give up I want you to tell me it was a very very uh comedic a very funny man and that was the way he taught he said I want you to tell me that you you can't do this by yourself so I can help you yeah and I try my best not to say that I didn't want to give up all right stood an hour another hour trying to fix what the problem was the what was wrong with the car is all right you give up now all right I give up now but here is what the Apostle Paul is telling Timothy is just don't rebuke an elderly but take him as a father and the elderly woman as mothers how many can say Amen to the word [Music] you know they're already big trees they got big shade and big branches and they've probably been you know some trees have different scars in different places but those big trees we can lean upon them grab that fruit that they have produced amen I'm going to read just one quote here and I'm not sure if the brothers already have it in the back and I'll be finishing hearing a message and a message Paradox preached in 1964. bless these my brothers and sisters some of these little women standing here who served and taking care of their husbands wow they worked out and they're in the fields foreign [Music] and we've battled a long time and we may never meet another we might never meet at another breakfast you know it's so nice that we have these sisters here yes sisters who have stood by their husbands and we would like to hear from them don't you want to hear from them I want to hear from them you want to hear from them you're talking about sisters oh brother sisters there wasn't any cell phones back then they weren't internet back then oh it was old-fashioned cooking back then and their husbands will go to the missionary Fields Oh They'll be at church all night long [Music] and they had to take care of the kids here and there there were no iPads to try to entertain the kids but that's mother stood right next to her husband raise them little kids to serve the Lord to stand right next to us oh don't you want a testimony like that oh may the Lord help us don't you love the Lord amen we're going to have sister kenoba Dominguez how many you know who she is amen but today we're going to hear from our sister and we're gonna she's gonna tell us a bit of her testimony how many are an expectations amen amen the scripture says rebuke not an elder this is amen as she can come forward and let's be praying for our sisters God bless each and every one of you Brothers I'm going to speak a little bit of what has been the trajectory of my life in regards to me knowing the Lord I go back to the I go back to the year of six of the 60s 62 when I got married and um when my husband and I were about four years married that's when the Lord began to deal with us and is [Music] and that's when we began to have the hardest part to start off I got six from a very severe allergy um ass I got worse and the doctor still didn't know what it was did I have that I had to separate my children from myself and um and back then I didn't know God in any way the only way that I need to cry was saying my God yes when the doctor said that I had to separate myself for me that was impossible to do I cried the entire night foreign [Music] it started I Believe by then God was starting to deal with us [Music] six months later my my husband's mother my mother-in-law yeah she went to go visit us devout woman of the Lord she loved the Lord foreign [Music] [Music] my husband didn't want to know anything because he already came from the house okay okay yes but I did have the knee yeah because when I was younger I always did that much I didn't know much because I really didn't understand that much I heard the songs that's when I began foreign but then she he was very understanding with me it would help me a lot when the female says it was an Apostolic church I don't know how it's called uh nothing I said I just know it was an Apostolic Church a [Music] is but it was about Noah and Noah's preaching for them to [Music] repented and then afterwards but it was a message that's where God was able to gravel over my heart and that's when I understand the gospel was and that's when I remember that my husband yeah and when I heard that message it seemed that I was living in that present time [Music] made me understand more and when the message was over I was eager foreign but I said to the Lord I don't understand that much but I believe I believe and got baptized in that church and when we went back home yesterday we were at home eagerness to ask what are you feeling I'm not going to tell you what I feel this is just for me and so I didn't explain to him what I felt yes and we kept going are you out there but I had a big blessing because I had friction because of what he was doing me getting sick and everything but there there was a complete change for me a complete change that I was just flipped around [Music] I also want to get baptized [Music] because the water's too cold right now and this is I come with a lot of embarrassment okay and I said he said I was embarrassed year old people got baptized and with the freezing water and with freezing water and I'm afraid of freezing water so he did give outside he did get baptized [Music] and we continued in the path of Our Lives uh [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] El Hermano [Music] [Music] thank you which is the eighth one but we didn't understand anything the only thing we did is read quotes and we would read it and what we read we realized it was important for us you know oh yeah he was talking to us about prophecies about brothers this is the eighth messenger was coming on to put on brother random shoes after him for us it's always foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and I told my and I didn't know anything about Phoenix or brothers that were there I said let's stay there and he would say no let's go to El Paso let's go to El Paso okay we'll go to El Paso and we left we went to El Paso we lived there 23 years but [Music] God helped us um because my mother-in-law she was a Christian and she really loved the Lord [Music] and speaking about God's word singing and you know reading the Bible that was very often that would happen in the nights yes and that's how we lasted after we left California we were there for two years at that house [Music] but just as visitors she would talk to the people and one time [Music] [Music] what are you saying what are you preaching about [Music] and then you know she said this is a Divine powerful man it's the message of the hour he's a prophet and all of that but my mother-in-law had already met the message through the brothers and another brother she had already accepted it and when that man passed by through there okay she said come over here she said can you show me that little book that you have because she showed it and it was brother Branham and said she said do you know this man and she said yes she said yeah she's a he's a mighty prophet and then she asked where are you coming from he said from Juarez [Music] so then she asks what's your name and his name was macedonio facio oh yes [Music] by chance do you know Juan Francisco a man that's named Juan Francisco she said yes he's my brother he's my brother where is he he's [Music] also has he also accepted the message and then she got the address and everything [Music] [Music] [Music] for 11 years we were very happy in that church he's a good brother he's such a he was a such a gentleman quite a bit of time from there the Lord my husband will go to the missions with them they would go to different places and that's when my children grow up also in that church so they were young be fair and it was such a very beautiful time a very beautiful time we have many trials and we would also struggle we would struggle yes we haven't wavered at all right always praising God and happy with God and with the Lord Jesus Christ last thing to know his word in brother Branham we were there for 11 years in that church what I want to give the testimony about [Music] my third daughter uh [Music] to get an operation on the appendix foreign [Music] but it was actually the appendix when I took her to the doctors the doctor said it was the appendix that an operation had to be done but my husband by then was working my children were small and I was alone going with her alone and the doctor said at one o'clock in the afternoon so I went with the children with her then at 1 pm he wanted to operate on her but since my daughter she's uh she was very nervous when they gave her the anesthesia it wouldn't have any effect on it I think they gave her too much but she got operated on by the time that she needed to be operated [Music] I was very desperate waiting I began to pray and pray and pray and I would say Lord I said Lord give me my daughter back giving my give me my daughter back those are the only words give me back my daughter Lord yes that's what was going on I didn't know what was going on a while after the doctor came out and said we had a setback with your daughter she said she had a cardiac arrest this is your daughter died but then he said she's fine now I said I'm sorry I didn't understand what do you mean your daughter died her heart stopped eat your make adventure and I was in shock s understand what was going on he said yeah but she's fine now she said the daughter came back the girl came back the girl came back to be able to massage your heart and I still [Music] [Music] she was out of danger now foreign [Music] [Music] why is there a lot of people coming here [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] but I've experienced it [Music] the greatest trial that we had was when foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it was something that was very serious and then I came here with him and I'm also amazed because God did America with him because Tony my son foreign [Music] [Music] and then I took him to the hospital they took off the bandages [Music] the doctor would ask what did you do because his skin is fully cleaning the healing began from his shoulders going down foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] to be here with him but I don't know what happened we didn't want to leave my daughter didn't want to leave my smallest one didn't want to leave her alone so that's the reason why we stayed here I don't know if it was time for us to be here right I don't know okay [Music] these are just the highlights but we've had many trials here I believe that's all I can say God bless you continue [Music] thank you I'm expecting anticipating a move from God a move from God and I'm expecting anticipating from God one more time I'm expecting [Music] I'm expecting and disappeared from God [Music] from God I'm expecting anticipate [Music] oh we won't be satisfied we won't be satisfied Heaven
