them up without the camp in a clean place and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of israel for a water of separation it is a purification of is it's for the congregation of israel the second scripture we have for today is ephesians chapter five verse 22. [Music] wives submit yourselves unto your own husband as unto the lord [Music] for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body for maridos christos therefore as the church is subject to christ so let the wise be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify it and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word [Music] we might not be taking too long today i think my throat's acting up today loosen up the collar here don't careful cue i'll do what what brother branham talks about the brother that put a for the breath in his mouth and he and he started preaching this and the deacons took him to the side afterwards we appreciated your message but uh it took a little longer than usual twice as long again he goes yeah usually i put a breath mint on my mouth when i'm speaking and this time it turned out that i was taking a little longer than usual see this is even more when i'm a little nervous i have a few updates before we get started brother juanito saucedo was in mexico last week in mexico he was the brother of orleans he says they had some good services out there [Music] and he was scheduled to to speak with us that is brother juanito but his daughter has covet and she lives with him so i had to take his place so whenever his family gets better he'll return [Music] so the proper thing to do is to stay at home wait a few days to get better and when they are all clear everyone's clear from the culvert yeah then you can get back get back and come to church i think that's a proper thing to do right if you have someone at home that's sick and you're taking care of them as a person we know that that kobe is highly contagious we do have a lot of families that are out families but it's better for them to get better and once they're better we we we like to see them so we know that virus is uh is very contagious but over 99 of the people are make it through the through the virus and take your medicine as soon as possible but even then you you have to be careful when you're out there is he told me everyone's going to get the virus sooner or later i really hadn't thought about that too much you told me you know what just everybody's going to get it sooner or l take care of each other and be careful we're also thinking about having a potluck type of thanksgiving november 21st that'll be in a couple of weeks it'll be uh before the actual thanksgiving it'll be after the message type thanksgiving outside or in the fellowship hall salad companies no brother brian says that thanksgiving is one of the most religious festivals or holidays america has it is festivals in america i remember in my home and i thought that was a big thing and that was a big thing for us and i think we should celebrate it somehow so what do you think you like the idea so i would say get with the sisters and uh maybe they can plan us a good thanksgiving dinner they look much better than our curtains and we thank the brothers who have been working on them painting them getting them fixed we're improving a little bit at a time we thank everyone that has put an effort to it you know brother joseph branham he uh he sends us a text information on tapes they hear every week all right up to anyone that's the one we should look at well ibrahim calls him a minor prophet yes brother brian calls him that monogram i call him [Music] and we should have respect for the man to for brother joseph branham jose branham no he sent us a tape last week called the thinking man's filter we're part of it on wednesday is how brother abraham blasted the american companies how the american companies can promote a product americana pay their scientists or doctors to say the wrong thing is everybody knowing that it's a bad product and yes promote it as a good product how could our people our own american companies our own people mr pro pueblo promote something that they know it's going to kill you i wonder if there's a reason that brother joseph sent us that tape we're going to see in particular something to think about can't trust everything you hear us i wonder if this is happening today that's what really interests me about this this subject is a thinking man's filter a thinking man's filter el filtro de nombre smoking is a death sentence and they proved that by mentioning or brother brahm proved that by mentioning the tests that were done at yet the companies were promoting it as a good production embargo a thinking man would smoke this brand of cigarettes now once again they paint their own scientists to say it was a safe product they paid their doctors to say it was a safe product and yet the companies knew that it would kill the user material they knew it would kill the users isn't you're making a product to kill somebody is that's a tough way to start a message a product that'll kill you now on line 39 of a thinking man's filter i'm just going to go over the thinking man's filter and then we'll call it an evening a day uh solamente now i thought how deceiving that is now that a tobacco companies are supposed to be american americans oh and we live in our policy we would be working to help one another you and how hypocritical is the reason i never called the company's name i've got to say something some bad things about them and how hypocritical can anybody be to make money to make money a thinking man wouldn't smoke at all but how the american public fall for it they think that that's wonderful and now look you cannot you cannot ask anybody scientists you'll you cannot have smoke without having tar us if there's one little speck of smoke comes through that star um and if you don't get any smoke well you get you don't get any tar no no and you don't get anything you know [Music] but as long as you get any smoke at all you're drawing in cancer a poisonous alkaloid c10h14 n2 that is the sheep active principle of tobacco and that is used as an insecticide and sometimes used in smoking cessation aids and if you have been with me last year or the year before last i believe it was at the world spur when your brain or brainerd and all of them was up there on demonstrations and you see them take the cigarette put it in something and put it across a piece of marble anyone know who your brain brainer is joe breiner us old folks he was the one that played the part of the pharaoh in the ten commandments he's the same person well he died in 1986 of lung cancer he was a heavy smoker as what i understand and that doctor taking a swab called rolled across there and got the nicotine off of it and put it on the back of a white rat and put him in a cage he and every seven days they took him out and the rat was so full of cancer couldn't walk for the nicotine out of the cigarettes you know they say that you you can't get it through a filter he said you cannot have a filter any filter that would take nicotine out it takes the smoke out said because you have to have smoke have tar to make the smoke and it's the tar that gives cancer us and then he went and pulled it through the water and said sometimes you think you could filter it through set every time that no matter where you pull it said they they say i don't inhale it then put it it then put it in their mouth and spit it out then he took that and rolled it up and put it under something there and showed it was still cancer produced what are you doing swallowing it down your throat see no matter what you do it's still death and then to think that a company would deceive a man even though they tried to deceive their own people it's like a vulture living up there's its own kind of pencil money making selling death to the country and to young men and go out there in on the battlefront and ate and die for them then turn around and sell such a thing as that under a false pretense a thinking man's filter but a smoky man's taste you'd have to have the smoke to get the taste a smoking man's taste false pretense false representations concerning past or present facts that are made with the intent to defraud another the definition of protection to don't believe everything you hear not every product they sell you is is a good product sponsors doesn't mean it's good for you it's up to you depending on the state how the people fall for it though they get it now it's only to deceive you for you they sell you that stuff just to watch you die as long as they get their money like politics and war como la politica i don't believe in war i don't believe that we all ever should have ever had a war you know [Music] album i believe in the kingdom that god is bringing the great civilization that will be brought down under his own great dominion there will never be another war nation won't lift up spirits against nations they'll all be peace eternal peace civilization so this kind of civilization brings war is the class of the civilization the more civilized we get under this the more war we have entre one trying to be more civilized than the other and the more civilized we get the more wars and look what under the civilization that a person will put out such a thing as that and the only thing it does it only deceives you to make you buy more cigarettes smoke cigarettes and i believe it is of the devil and there is a nicotine devil in a man and or a woman refused and if one cigarette will satisfy that nicotine devil till he'll leave you alone and quit hunting you with one cigarette diablo nicotine and you take a filter just lets you one third of that smoke through there then or one third of that nicotine through there then it'll take three cigarettes to take the place of that one and you'll smoke three to one so one cigarette gives you the nicotine that that devil wants for you they put a filter and now you gotta smoke three filters then the company sells three instead of just one company i wonder if the government does that to us here's one oh you know what here's the second one here's the third one oh you know what here's the fourth one in in real estate in buenos aires we say don't don't just don't agree so a comma agreed to a period in real estate we have something called a 10-day inspection period inspection some people will call you and tell you hey you know we need so and so fixed the rookie realtor will say okay we'll do it then you make a decision a decision but a smart way of doing things with companies yes [Music] that's how this uh cigarette companies put this i see publican see it's only a scheme to deceive a scheme to try to sell you try to sell cigarettes foreign they can sell more that way than they can just letting a man smoke a straight tobacco in his pipe or in a cigarette now see it's of the devil diablo as i stood there as a stutter looking at it a thinking of how deceitful it was the question came to me and i stood back looked at the pack again and i just seemed like something said to me but the slogan is right a thinking man's filter a smoking man states [Music] and he did and that's that's what the slogan that's what the slogan was on that pack of cigarettes it came to me that that deceitfulness also in the natural realm there in the tobacco is something in order of the churches today see deceitfulness it's come to the whole world has become a great deception of what is true is really true and what's right see even in politics and in social affair in school and everything it becomes a deceitfulness does the government really care for you that's just me okay brother brahm talks about a general i'm sorry colonel uh elemono branham talks about a colonel that's only thinking about himself this is a young man this young soldier have your name sold he gets run over by a by a tank the poor guy is dying there el porter take him to the hospital now this poor guy he's a regular guy he's a what the what the big shots call a nobody basically important he stands in line he's dying there el estan filas esperando yeah little boy or a little daughter that has a rash in the ham instead of the young man that's dying because he was crushed by a by a so i wonder what the big shots think about us little people it is he says if this kernel would have been a genuine feeling for his brother out there in the line he would have said this kid can wait get that man up here quickly do something for him no they're not all like that no no no but there is too many like that there's too many of them that's like that exists but the man the only thing he was thinking of was of his own little boy that had a rash on his hands not thinking of the poor boy standing there mashed under a tank the very tank and maybe the very boy that would save his life someday in the battlefront see they don't stop to think only for themselves let's get into the the church and it has to do with the government what we just talked about is about the government about companies i looked i looked at it and thought it's something like the denominations of today the churches that we have denominations each one of them has their own filter they have their own type of filter they let just that come in that way to and what not to come in what they filter in and filter out with their own kind of a filter they just get they just let so much of the world get in to satisfy the unbelievers that's in there because the but there's one thing about it you can't get the church of god like that not that the denominational now i mean the real genuine church of god our nola denominacion man has always looked for someone or something he could worship all through history man has tried to worship someone or something he knows that there's something out there on 62 line 62. so the human being no matter how fallen he is he still knows there's something somewhere else but he's got such a taste of the world that he cannot take the correct filter he has to have his own man-made filter each one making their own kind of filters as i spoke this morning and last sunday morning on that wheel in the middle of the wheel or that little inside soul on the inside of the spirit yellow ultimate how the spirit on the inside between the soul and the body can be absol can be absolutely anointed with the holiest ghost did you understand that absolutely how to follow that in the in with the continuity of the message the god of this world the anointed ones in the last days that outside that middle circle that first circle is the is a human census a second circle is the spirit census will sell will self-will desire and so forth but the inside is the soul the soul that was pre-destinated so they can anoint the spirit to make the outside body come in subjection to the spirit but the soul that sinneth that soul shall die the soul that rejects in unbelief the word of god which it is a part of that soul shall eternally has always has is ezekiel 18 20. i believe in an eternal death same as i believe in an eternal heaven but not an internal hell but there's no such a thing as eternal hell there's an eternal death for people that are many of them religious in the world today has always been dead many of them religious in the world today has always been dead muchos the woman that lives in pleasure with her bobbed hair and painted face is dead while she is alive she may be religious but she never was saying she's got an outward motion for afuera she might sing in the choir or she might dance in the spirit she might speak in tongues and have all the manifestations of the spirit but unless the soul on the inside is of god's daughter see she is gone no matter what she does first timothy 5'6 but she that liveth and pleasure is dead while she living you ever wonder why brother branham always said bob hair and painted face always said something else here but i wonder why brother abraham said painted face painting pets you go all the way back to jezebel what's to impress something or someone but uh impressionara alien or algo so you might say uh bob here us the style of the people el estilo del pueblo and uh is there while she lives that's just me it says the woman that liveth in pleasure with her bobbed hair and painted face is dead while she lives but she was never saved she might sing in the choir she might dance in the spirit she might speak in tongues and have all manifestations of the spirit but unless that soul on the inside is god's daughter see she's gone no matter what she does is hey man i'm in we're almost done yeah brother brown says uh on um the serpent's seed i don't think i have that one up there oh yes i do so look here if their mother was a chorus girl and their grandmother and her mother was a flapper what she's today a rock and roll striptease what's her children going to be is when you're born of the spirit of god then you've got a you you are a son of god and you always was a son of god and you always will be a son of god you see no way to separate it because it's you have eternal life and eternal never did begin never will it end up this is a this next part i like this next part oh for the grace of god that he would give us understanding of such great mysteries as paul spoke here further on down in ephesians speaking of the husband and wife and said this is a mystery how the woman should re should be in respect to her husband is mysterious even the second place i believe it is the entire bible that reverence was ever spoken to said the woman seeing she reverenced her husband reverence her husband questioned i think those are fighting words for today's world then a husband ought to live such a life before his wife that his wife could reverence him as a son of god and esposito and if he doesn't live that kind of life well then of course she wouldn't reverse him because she knows what he's made of classes but when it's a man that is reverent man reverent and clean with his wife and before his family a real servant of god then the woman children and all should respect that servant of god with that is tremendous right there is when any of those items gets out of sequence there's enough balance there and this existing library the other way around if there's another different item in that family there's problems with now notice women they want to have bobbed hair they want to wear shorts pants makeup these little bikinis and things that they they wear nowadays they want to do it and yet want to go to church you see the anointing on the spirit and not about not upon the soul yes see that that's a lot that's a mouthful right there but it says you have the body you have the anointing on the spirit sorel the soul is where you have to be worried about if the spirit of god is in that soul then the spirit will do the word of god amen amen you have the body the spirit anointing of god or of the devil and the soul has to be of god now that's why you must be born again if you're not born again then you're just in the spirit entonces solo stats but you need to so you cannot have to worry about whether or not you're going to do this or whether or not you're going to do that you do it by nature god is in the soul amen 75. so it wants to be a christian and also do these things and the pastor says it's okay then if he says it's okay you can be a member your name can be on my church book here it's okay then he is giving you his denominational filter to suit a worldly woman's taste is she loves the world she likes the taste of it so he's got a filter for her but she's a long ways from being a thinking woman but there you are that's where i found this text no 76 no no she isn't a thinking woman if she was a thinking she would know the church isn't going to judge her at the last day the church is judging her now by her membership her loyalty to the circles that she belongs to and the societies they are judging her now by that but god is going to judge her at the last day so we're almost done here yeah my candy's gone now yes so uh just a couple of things just to just to nail down about a thinker in amazon now if there is a theological filter for the theological thinker and there is a church filter for a church thinker a cigarette filter for a cigarette thinker there's got to be a real filter somewhere for the real thinker and god has a filter and that's his word it's a separator it for it's a the waters of separation for sin no that's the thinking man or the holy man's taste all right i want to be a thinking man to think who i am who i'm going to stand by one of these days for judgment who am i going to stand by one of these days for judgment i want to stand on the right side of the 121 when you come to this world you are born in sin you don't even come with a fighting chance you were born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies within your own spirit you deserve you you the desire of sin the lover of sin because you were born in sin you didn't even have a chance don't think this is on there but but down inside of you somewhere here you come there was something in there that began to draw bro if you note it was something that told you there was a god somewhere and you read his word then you took the church you took their ideas when you was told better then you never used a thinking man's filter entonces glacier tomorrow but when you use god's filter which is a thinking man's filter because all other filters will pass away but mine shall not recon and when you take god's filter you draw your life your desires if you draw your desires through god's filter a thinking man's filter there is nothing but god there's nothing left now if you want the evidence of the holy ghost there it is when that soul of yours will line with the word of god in every respect it shows you've drawn your life through a thinking man's filter god's m just got a couple more here 178. now if you are a thinking people tonight here and out in the land where the message is going your desire will be a bible taste not a denominational taste for you will be judged by the very bible the word that i'm asking you to filter your soul through hours i'm asking you to filter your soul through and to reject one word of it and not let your soul pass through the word you'll be turned down not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded off of the mouth of god it will be brought into you predestinated and when the lord breathes upon you his spirit will quicken that word to a reality and you'll see that jesus christ is the same yesterday today in pereira the word if you are predestinated you see it there's no way to hide it from you you look there and say why it's just so plain for me so plain before my face i look at it there it is i'm look at i'm looking right at it i see it here it is the word every word just word by word living out then there's a state of eternal life that you want to direct and when you breathe through that what can come through that god's filter nothing but the spirit no world at all no unbelief at all is god's filter and when you breathe through that nothing can get through that but the holy ghost now you got the evidence of the holy ghost see a holy man or a woman's taste they want to live they got eternal life and because this word is quickened to them they live a thinking man's filter and a holy man's taste auras father celestial thank you lord for the message of the hour lord for revealing that word to us for quickening that word in thank you lord for your message lord there's nowhere else to go lord no i don't know there's nowhere else to go to your world i
