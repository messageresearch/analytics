[49:30] first of all i would like to thank god
[49:32] that brought us here safely
[49:36] we come from the city of tucson
[49:40] we've been living there for around 16
[49:42] years now idiosynos
[49:57] for the invitation that he extended
[49:59] towards us
[50:03] we hope you don't let them down this
[50:04] morning
[50:05] amen
[50:08] and as well to the local ministry and
[50:10] all the brothers
[50:14] we
[50:15] hope to be able to get a good time out
[50:16] of this morning
[50:21] before we open the scripture
[50:26] the church nearly the whole church is
[50:28] with us here this morning
[50:32] i say nearly everyone because not
[50:34] everyone was able to come
[50:37] it's a small group little
[50:47] well what can i say about the city of
[50:49] the church of tucson
[50:52] group there's no better group to deal
[50:55] with than the one that god has given us
[50:57] there not informa problema no one causes
[50:59] any issues
[51:03] and then the one that causes the issue
[51:04] gets into it
[51:06] and there no one wants to get into any
[51:08] problems with me group
[51:10] it's a group that loves god
[51:14] we're all striving as as to say
[51:20] that
[51:30] [Applause]
[51:34] thank you
[51:52] sometimes as a human being you speak or
[51:54] you say things that as paul says you
[51:56] don't understand
[52:01] one time i heard someone else say
[52:05] he was telling to the person that was at
[52:07] their side
[52:10] oh yeah the brother he lives in tucson
[52:16] there he's you know he's in charge there
[52:21] there's a little group there that isn't
[52:23] even growing
[52:29] the tremendous thing is that this person
[52:33] what i know
[52:35] has never been in tucson
[52:40] at least they're with us maybe in the
[52:42] city yes but not with us
[52:48] and it made me remember of those that
[52:50] don't love brother branham
[52:54] and they are always trying to say
[52:55] something negative about brother branagh
[52:58] but they don't really know anything
[53:00] about brother branagh
[53:02] they don't know where he was born
[53:05] who his parents were quantos
[53:07] how many children he had
[53:12] they're completely unaware they don't
[53:13] know anything at all
[53:23] and just the same way we as humans we
[53:25] say something about someone or a place
[53:30] but before we get into the word
[53:34] i'm just going to take a few three or
[53:36] five minutes
[53:46] in june the 1st 2006 we moved to the
[53:49] city of tucson
[53:51] uh
[53:57] we've been living there for and residing
[53:59] there for 16 years and one month now
[54:03] and the sister only began with one
[54:05] sister
[54:08] that's
[54:19] she's the guilty one of why we're there
[54:22] serving the lord
[54:28] me and my family but in that time we had
[54:30] the two oldest the one that song lin and
[54:32] the one that was playing the piano yes
[54:36] and that's how the church started in
[54:38] tucson
[54:42] today
[54:45] god he's kept us there
[54:48] by god's grace
[55:03] about three years ago
[55:05] [Music]
[55:15] god allowed us to be able to get a
[55:17] building through the help of my
[55:18] brother-in-law jose sosa
[55:20] [Music]
[55:22] and in two years
[55:26] the lord allowed us to pay off the
[55:27] building
[55:32] after that we got a debt but with the
[55:35] land that was attached to it
[55:40] because our project is to build a
[55:42] sanctuary
[55:46] and then the current building that we
[55:47] have we were trying to turn it into a
[55:49] dining hall uh
[55:52] and if we hope if the lord carries
[55:55] medicine and if god blesses us
[55:59] we hope that we can complete that task
[56:01] amen amen
[56:06] then you know that will become storage
[56:11] if you uh know the message that's what
[56:12] brother branham says
[56:19] he says that the churches that don't
[56:20] join the worldwide council of churches
[56:22] they'll become a storage house
[56:27] so we're hoping if the lord comes soon
[56:32] or if he terry's or may he help us
[56:37] now if we can all please stand
[56:39] it's cool
[56:40] i apologize
[56:55] is
[57:24] okay
[57:37] and we called it jesus christ the same
[57:39] yesterday today and forever
[57:48] malachi chapter 3 verse 6.
[58:04] it reads for i am the lord i change not
[58:07] therefore ye sons of jacob are not
[58:09] consumed
[58:11] now let's go to hebrews
[58:15] chapter 13
[58:17] verse
[58:19] 8.
[58:42] my family that's in colombia they're
[58:44] they know that i'm here and they also
[58:45] send you their greetings
[58:55] and in the little town of trinchera
[58:57] there's a little mission a little church
[58:59] that we have there me come on
[59:04] i got in contact with the brother and
[59:05] they also send you their greetings
[59:13] and it reads jesus christ the same
[59:14] yesterday and today and forever
[59:21] lord father we thank you this this
[59:23] morning
[59:26] we ask that you give us the calm
[59:30] response we know that there's a great
[59:33] responsibility that's ahead of us
[59:38] there's a people that have a desire to
[59:40] draw close to you
[59:47] and i believe the entire purpose of a
[59:49] minister is to raise and build up the
[59:51] faith of the people
[59:54] so we ask you lord for your help
[59:56] we ask that you be with us
[1:00:29] we usually in tucson we have bible
[1:00:31] studies but through fun
[1:00:39] and things that you're able to learn
[1:00:41] through the reading of the bible
[1:00:44] as you begin to learn god's nature
[1:00:50] what are the things that god likes or
[1:00:51] what are the things he doesn't like
[1:00:54] in through
[1:01:06] and he left every experience and
[1:01:08] everything that's written inside of
[1:01:09] there ah
[1:01:11] so it can be helpful
[1:01:19] because one of the things that came to
[1:01:21] mind
[1:01:22] is uh
[1:01:28] i was working the story of hannah came
[1:01:31] to mind
[1:01:36] how is it that hannah in the old
[1:01:38] testament
[1:01:41] the bible says that she was barren yes
[1:01:47] and she was married to a man i believe
[1:01:49] his name was canna
[1:01:57] she was very grieved because she was
[1:01:59] unable to have children
[1:02:08] and the scripture says that she would go
[1:02:09] to the temple and pray
[1:02:14] and it says there she poured out her
[1:02:16] heart and her spirit
[1:02:22] and there was a priest during that time
[1:02:23] his name was elij
[1:02:31] and eli saw that she was praying and he
[1:02:33] thought that she was drunk
[1:02:38] but truly what was happening is that she
[1:02:39] was grieved in her heart
[1:02:43] how many of you can remember that story
[1:02:46] bueno
[1:02:54] the story ends that god gave her a son
[1:02:58] and that the name of that son was samuel
[1:03:10] and what came to me or the reason why
[1:03:12] this came to me is
[1:03:28] that way god can answer our needs
[1:03:37] but very few times we practice the habit
[1:03:39] of coming to the altar or praying to god
[1:03:42] polo normal
[1:03:57] but there is something special about the
[1:03:59] altar ayalgo especially
[1:04:02] there's something special about coming
[1:04:04] to the house of the lord amen amen
[1:04:10] and when you apply
[1:04:24] uh
[1:04:48] the same thing that he established in
[1:04:49] the beginning that remains being the
[1:04:51] same thing that's established
[1:04:56] it's a good thing that god doesn't
[1:04:57] accept us because we're from a certain
[1:04:59] family or a certain church
[1:05:02] there's only one way
[1:05:04] and it's under repentance
[1:05:18] because if it were to be that way then
[1:05:20] he died in vain at the cross
[1:05:23] we all come under the blood amen amen
[1:05:29] the prophet says that god does not have
[1:05:31] any grandchildren amen amen
[1:05:49] it says that the judge
[1:05:52] barely be saved amen amen
[1:05:59] so you can see the thief at the cross
[1:06:02] at his last
[1:06:26] he made some mistakes in his life
[1:06:42] he had to pay the consequences or just
[1:06:44] face the consequences
[1:06:51] but then the bible also states that he
[1:06:52] was a man after god's own heart
[1:06:58] okay your
[1:07:06] how is it that a man with all those
[1:07:08] mistakes uh he was still labeled as a
[1:07:10] man after god in god's own heart
[1:07:12] you know they go
[1:07:22] [Music]
[1:07:26] the man himself recognized that he
[1:07:28] needed from god
[1:07:30] and he would always humble himself
[1:07:34] and that's what god wants for a man to
[1:07:36] recognize
[1:07:38] that god is god
[1:07:40] and that he can help us
[1:07:41] amen amen
[1:07:47] and if that god does not change
[1:07:52] i mean
[1:08:04] i understood that god made a covenant
[1:08:06] with abraham
[1:08:10] in other words god he made a commitment
[1:08:13] and god gave his word
[1:08:16] when god gives his word
[1:08:18] he can't move from that
[1:08:20] clc is that right amen
[1:08:22] amen know
[1:08:24] even though if you don't say amen that's
[1:08:27] how god is
[1:08:29] what god says
[1:08:35] there was a brother that one time he
[1:08:36] said he was going to go go with me to
[1:08:38] mexico
[1:08:42] he said yes brother i'll go with you
[1:08:50] he's thought that when he said he was
[1:08:52] going to go with me he thought there was
[1:08:53] going to be a big group that
[1:08:55] was going to join me
[1:08:57] and that's why i believe he he had the
[1:08:59] courage to go
[1:09:04] and then one day when i called him
[1:09:07] mexico and i said brother let's go to
[1:09:08] mexico
[1:09:10] and i said who's going
[1:09:13] and i said uh it's just you and me
[1:09:18] and he said
[1:09:31] and i said brother you told me back then
[1:09:33] that if i ever needed your help then you
[1:09:36] would go with me
[1:09:39] i said yeah brother i said it but i
[1:09:41] didn't swear
[1:09:44] so man he always takes back what he said
[1:09:51] and depends on the circumstances that is
[1:09:53] surrounding the person they either you
[1:09:55] know they take a step back
[1:09:58] that's the human tendency that's how
[1:10:00] everyone is and some more than others
[1:10:04] is that right
[1:10:05] but that's how we are
[1:10:07] i want to buy a car
[1:10:12] and they see the price the insurance the
[1:10:14] price of gases and you know what i don't
[1:10:15] want to buy anything
[1:10:17] we regret it amen amen
[1:10:23] the decision he made
[1:10:26] that's a definitive decision forever
[1:10:28] amen amen
[1:10:36] is telling the people of israel
[1:10:39] you know what you've misbehaved a lot
[1:10:42] you're just
[1:10:51] remember that's not my subject my
[1:10:53] subject is jesus christ the same
[1:10:54] yesterday today and
[1:10:57] but forever if you're not paying your
[1:10:58] tithing then line up with god
[1:11:02] if they asked brother branham the
[1:11:03] question hermano brananan brother
[1:11:04] branham
[1:11:06] a man that doesn't pay his ties
[1:11:15] he says well i don't really have any
[1:11:17] biblical support to say that
[1:11:20] but he says but a christian pays his
[1:11:22] tithes
[1:11:24] amen amen
[1:11:38] oh
[1:11:42] what you're doing is you're blocking or
[1:11:43] interfering with your own blessing
[1:11:47] i've found at least two things
[1:11:52] that it obligates
[1:12:00] now you pay your tithing and you often
[1:12:02] don't think no i'm just going to give my
[1:12:03] tithing now and then my offering later
[1:12:07] the bible speaks of tithing and offering
[1:12:09] coc is that right
[1:12:12] you pick your tithing and your offering
[1:12:14] israel and bless is wrong
[1:12:17] and god will bless you
[1:12:19] is that right
[1:12:32] and here the people of israel were
[1:12:34] misbehaving
[1:12:45] through god's mind he thought that he
[1:12:47] was going to wipe away the entire people
[1:12:49] of israel
[1:12:54] said one time he decided i'm going to
[1:12:56] wipe every single one of them
[1:12:59] and then there was a man that stood okay
[1:13:20] [Applause]
[1:13:28] i don't want to say this but the people
[1:13:29] of israel is the type of the church
[1:13:32] and sometimes the church doesn't behave
[1:13:34] correctly
[1:13:37] is that true
[1:13:47] we're all in different stages you know
[1:13:48] up and down some are just really bad and
[1:13:50] they're for 40 years they've been in the
[1:13:52] same condition
[1:13:55] but there's other that misbehave because
[1:13:56] they still have not understood amen
[1:14:26] he says that's why you have not been
[1:14:28] consumed
[1:14:31] just as you are i still take care of you
[1:14:36] how tremendous uh how tremendous is god
[1:14:39] but uh remember
[1:14:51] it's better that we react before it's
[1:14:52] too late
[1:14:53] amen amen
[1:15:06] and he was calling them and was saying
[1:15:07] do the right thing uh
[1:15:13] leave aside the whims and the hardness
[1:15:15] of your heart
[1:15:18] that's what god was telling the people
[1:15:19] of israel
[1:15:21] for them to line up with the word
[1:15:27] and we find that the messenger of the
[1:15:28] age
[1:15:32] he says that jehovah of the old
[1:15:34] testament
[1:15:36] is jesus christ of the new testament
[1:15:39] amen amen
[1:15:42] so we can find pablo hablando
[1:15:46] that paul is speaking to the hebrews
[1:16:02] and in that same letter he said jesus
[1:16:03] christ is the same yesterday today
[1:16:05] forever
[1:16:08] he doesn't change he still remains the
[1:16:09] same
[1:16:10] amen amen
[1:16:14] we thank god for jesus christ
[1:16:15] [Music]
[1:16:17] because he had mercy on us amen
[1:16:28] god gave me two older brothers and then
[1:16:30] a younger sister
[1:16:43] but i was what you know what they say
[1:16:44] the black sheep of the family is
[1:17:02] the good thing is that i was a black
[1:17:04] sheep i was still a sheep but there's
[1:17:05] other ones that are goats but they're
[1:17:06] white goats
[1:17:08] and gods he rescued me
[1:17:12] god he crossed my path
[1:17:21] [Music]
[1:17:26] but he also allowed me by his race to be
[1:17:28] able to know the message
[1:17:34] and we believe that this message is is
[1:17:37] the great the greatest
[1:17:40] it gives us all the information that we
[1:17:42] need
[1:17:57] the one that says something different to
[1:17:59] it
[1:18:01] paul said let him be accursed amen amen
[1:18:05] is that true
[1:18:09] you should only stick to what the
[1:18:11] message says
[1:18:13] so why i'll look for anything else coc
[1:18:16] is that true
[1:18:18] if we stay with what the message says
[1:18:22] even though it hurts sometimes
[1:18:32] and then there's uh some filth that is
[1:18:34] so sticky sometimes
[1:18:38] then the grease that's in the hands of
[1:18:39] the mechanic
[1:18:42] and god has to do something but he
[1:18:44] cleans you cozy isn't that true
[1:18:50] we don't need a another revelatory
[1:19:17] to hear brother branham
[1:19:19] is
[1:19:23] a ministry unlike any other ah
[1:19:28] and sincerely
[1:19:31] where we thank god for that
[1:19:46] but there's also people that listen to
[1:19:48] these messages
[1:19:50] and the best thing is
[1:19:53] to hear him
[1:19:59] and to stay with them
[1:20:12] it's only this message
[1:20:26] god allowed us to be in jeffersonville
[1:20:32] and there we were able to meet up with
[1:20:33] some brothers
[1:20:36] brothers that we met previously before
[1:20:45] and you know there was a time that there
[1:20:46] was a lot of people that were moving
[1:20:47] over to jeffersonville
[1:20:53] pastores i even met pastors
[1:20:56] or at least just one pastor
[1:21:14] that the reason for which she moved to
[1:21:16] jeffersonville
[1:21:19] because the word truly is in
[1:21:21] jeffersonville
[1:21:36] [Music]
[1:21:39] and today we even are able to have him
[1:21:41] in social media
[1:21:44] like on youtube
[1:21:48] so you can say that the word of god is
[1:21:50] on youtube
[1:21:52] isn't that right
[1:22:02] if you go to jeffersonville and over
[1:22:03] there you hear the message marriage and
[1:22:05] divorce
[1:22:09] and then you come to phoenix and you
[1:22:10] hear marriage and divorce
[1:22:12] it says the same thing
[1:22:15] isn't that right
[1:22:17] you don't have to go anywhere
[1:22:18] specifically
[1:22:20] okay
[1:22:44] and i i didn't give it to the brothers i
[1:22:46] don't know if they can put it up
[1:22:51] i want to read in the message god is his
[1:22:53] own interpreter
[1:22:57] i'll read paragraph 49
[1:23:10] and what the prophet said here really
[1:23:12] caught my attention
[1:23:20] and he's speaking on the manifestation
[1:23:22] jesus christ
[1:23:24] of jesus christ in this last day
[1:23:29] and it says
[1:23:33] do you guys like this
[1:23:35] is it fine if i read it
[1:23:39] it's not only
[1:23:41] play the tape here
[1:23:49] because my motto is you know that you
[1:23:51] play the tape that you read the bible
[1:23:52] you read the message and also pay your
[1:23:54] tithing an offering
[1:23:56] isn't that right
[1:23:59] is it good or are we only sticking to
[1:24:01] playing the tapes
[1:24:05] the prophet says
[1:24:09] he says brother isaac he's terrible
[1:24:12] apprentice de los hermanos
[1:24:26] what good thing did he learn from them
[1:24:43] it's good to see you
[1:24:47] even though it's a lie you're really not
[1:24:49] happy to see that person
[1:24:51] he's not right
[1:24:53] and i say look brother
[1:24:57] i'm also pleased that you can see them
[1:25:01] that's something that i learned from the
[1:25:02] bruness
[1:25:04] isn't that right
[1:25:06] there's a people that call you
[1:25:09] here
[1:25:23] you think it's a miracle that they say
[1:25:30] there's people that told me here here in
[1:25:31] the tabernacle
[1:25:33] hermano they say brother
[1:25:38] it's a miracle that you came in
[1:25:41] and they've never gone too soon
[1:25:43] and i'm here every once in a while
[1:25:48] and it's a miracle
[1:25:52] now the miracle is when you go over
[1:25:53] there
[1:25:58] the prophet says
[1:26:02] jesus
[1:26:05] he says jesus looked at them and said
[1:26:13] this is why you speak that against the
[1:26:14] son of man it'll be forgiving you
[1:26:19] but when the holy ghost
[1:26:21] haciendo las mis mas cosas to do the
[1:26:23] same thing
[1:26:31] speak against that it will it'll never
[1:26:34] be forgiven
[1:26:35] you in this world or in the world to
[1:26:36] come
[1:26:43] he was prophesying of our day the day
[1:26:45] that we should see
[1:26:48] amen brothers
[1:27:02] for he is the same yesterday today and
[1:27:04] forever
[1:27:07] and then the prophet keeps saying
[1:27:12] remember it was jesus christ that was in
[1:27:14] moses
[1:27:16] now the question is
[1:27:19] who was the one that was in william
[1:27:20] branham
[1:27:23] jesus christ jesus christ coc is not
[1:27:26] true
[1:27:30] what he
[1:27:43] in this next paragraph it says
[1:27:47] paragraph 95
[1:27:55] the prophet says here they say
[1:27:58] elohim
[1:28:06] he says he was elohim manifested in
[1:28:08] human flesh wearing human clothes eating
[1:28:10] humans food
[1:28:12] amen
[1:28:24] a sign that in the last days that god
[1:28:26] will appear again among his people in
[1:28:28] human flesh
[1:28:29] amen amen
[1:28:31] jesus
[1:28:32] jesus
[1:28:37] the works that i shall do you do also
[1:28:46] and as it was in the days of sodom so
[1:28:48] shall it be at the coming of the son of
[1:28:50] man amen amen
[1:28:55] i don't need no interpreting necesita
[1:28:57] manifestation it needs manifestation
[1:29:02] that's what it needs amen amen
[1:29:06] do you believe that
[1:29:22] any man that wholeheartedly wants to
[1:29:24] draw close to god yes
[1:29:26] and they hear the message of the hour
[1:29:29] something strikes their heart
[1:29:32] isn't that true
[1:29:34] it's a mighty message
[1:29:36] that helps us amen amen
[1:29:39] isn't that true
[1:29:41] how many like will william branham says
[1:29:47] before i see the next
[1:29:49] one uh
[1:30:03] that god has been really good to me
[1:30:08] and it's good to be here
[1:30:13] and to join together to be able to honor
[1:30:15] the resurrection
[1:30:23] that it was the desire of the local
[1:30:25] pastor for us to be here
[1:30:30] what we did is we didn't cancel the
[1:30:32] service
[1:30:36] we just moved it to here to phoenix
[1:30:39] so now here we're holding the service
[1:30:51] and god has been giving different
[1:30:53] talents and gifts to the young people
[1:30:58] and this group of sea that god has
[1:31:00] raised in tucson
[1:31:05] in one way or another not because i wish
[1:31:07] it to be
[1:31:15] somehow the among the young people the
[1:31:17] responsibility has fallen on my children
[1:31:21] for which i'm very grateful with the
[1:31:23] lord
[1:31:25] for the children that god has given me
[1:31:29] [Music]
[1:31:44] one of those is that he understands a
[1:31:45] lot about music
[1:31:49] so what we're doing in tucson nosotros
[1:31:53] indispensable we don't plea we don't
[1:31:55] believe that a person is
[1:31:56] absolutely essential
[1:32:00] we believe that there are really
[1:32:01] important in the church
[1:32:04] but not absolutely essential
[1:32:07] the only one that's absolutely essential
[1:32:10] in the church
[1:32:25] and these young people every one of them
[1:32:27] is learning to play an instrument
[1:32:30] and as i've told them
[1:32:34] the more learning that you add
[1:32:38] you'll be greater blessings
[1:32:41] if you can't do this then you can do
[1:32:42] this
[1:32:46] and i'm very happy with the lord
[1:32:50] another thing
[1:32:52] is
[1:33:08] and
[1:33:09] luckily there's been an interest of
[1:33:10] going there to tucson
[1:33:12] and that's good
[1:33:15] fellowship
[1:33:18] it's beautiful to have fellowship
[1:33:34] uh
[1:34:01] they're well behaved
[1:34:06] and if they're not well behaved then
[1:34:07] they get into problems with me
[1:34:12] but we never just you know string them
[1:34:13] along los giamos we just we lead them
[1:34:44] i don't
[1:34:51] he says we'll never become perfect to
[1:34:53] the eyes of our neighbor
[1:34:57] he's not saying that we're never going
[1:34:58] to be perfect he says
[1:35:02] he says we'll never be perfect
[1:35:06] before the eyes of our neighbor media
[1:35:08] hope just look at job
[1:35:13] the bible says that he was
[1:35:15] righteous he was upright and perfect
[1:35:16] before the lord
[1:35:19] but it doesn't say before the eyes of
[1:35:20] men
[1:35:24] because he had some friends that were
[1:35:25] just eating him
[1:35:26] alive have you read that story
[1:35:31] no this is all you may be saying or you
[1:35:33] maybe you did this
[1:35:38] and surely enough maybe those sinners
[1:35:40] those friends were more sinner than job
[1:35:42] himself
[1:35:44] but they wanted to be judged amen amen
[1:35:51] but i thank god
[1:35:54] i'm very proud
[1:35:56] i say it wholeheartedly
[1:36:00] i know that i will be accountable for
[1:36:02] what i say on the day of judgement
[1:36:05] in the blood
[1:36:08] family i couldn't have a better family
[1:36:11] than what god has given me yes
[1:36:13] and spiritually
[1:36:16] i couldn't have a better church
[1:36:22] everyone you know they're shoulder to
[1:36:24] shoulder everyone's helping there
[1:36:27] i'm very proud of them
[1:36:35] when i mentioned the shoulder to
[1:36:36] shoulder thing i just remember brother
[1:36:37] sergio navarrete when he would say the
[1:36:39] one that wouldn't put their shoulder in
[1:36:41] is just the serpent
[1:36:44] he's the only head and then he has the
[1:36:47] body
[1:36:50] he has no shoulders so he can't he can
[1:36:52] go shoulder-to-shoulder with you
[1:36:55] amen amen
[1:36:57] [Laughter]
[1:37:08] i just want to read a paragraph and then
[1:37:10] i don't want to wear you out we'll be
[1:37:12] finishing
[1:37:18] brother branham says in paragraph 74
[1:37:27] how many understood the elohim god the
[1:37:29] great god
[1:37:30] was manifested today
[1:38:05] the devil couldn't say well i think i
[1:38:06] believe oh it was revealed to me
[1:38:11] how did the devil come
[1:38:14] for him to believe him
[1:38:16] the first thing he said
[1:38:20] is that he couldn't deny what was
[1:38:22] written
[1:38:23] he said it is written
[1:38:27] even though it was something that was
[1:38:28] said he was coming to prove sometimes
[1:38:35] if someone comes to teach something
[1:38:36] different than what william branham
[1:38:41] at least do it like the devil show me
[1:38:43] where it's written
[1:38:45] because if it's not written
[1:38:48] i don't believe him
[1:38:50] isn't that right amen amen
[1:38:53] when you're going to leave an
[1:38:54] inheritance
[1:38:56] you have to
[1:39:05] who knows that is going to have the the
[1:39:08] cow that only has one eye
[1:39:38] to be able to speak to him through him
[1:39:40] to the people
[1:39:42] hear him
[1:39:45] the prophet says
[1:39:48] or elohim in human flesh is saying
[1:40:08] where program 64 says lot is a type of
[1:40:10] the nominal denominational church down
[1:40:13] in sodom
[1:40:16] how many here are part of the
[1:40:18] denominational church in sodom
[1:40:20] i
[1:40:28] believe that we're the bride of the lord
[1:40:30] jesus christ everyone
[1:40:32] at least do it by faith
[1:40:34] true
[1:41:21] says watch the bible said that the sins
[1:41:23] of sodom vexed his righteous soul daily
[1:41:28] says
[1:41:33] why didn't he have nerve enough to stand
[1:41:35] out against it
[1:41:39] in other words
[1:41:42] job could see what was going on
[1:41:55] now let's keep reading what the prophet
[1:41:57] says
[1:42:12] hombres
[1:42:26] is
[1:42:29] he says there's a many a good man
[1:42:31] sitting in church today looking out and
[1:42:33] seeing women with shorts on and men
[1:42:35] doing these things and their memories
[1:42:37] going playing golf on sunday and picnic
[1:42:39] parties and swimming and things instead
[1:42:41] of attending church
[1:42:46] sitting home on wednesday night
[1:42:51] watching television instead of attending
[1:42:53] church
[1:43:11] they feel like saying something about it
[1:43:13] but the board would put them out
[1:43:16] he says what's the matter then
[1:43:20] it's la again
[1:43:22] mirando
[1:43:34] and afraid to call sin sin
[1:43:51] person is
[1:43:58] to say a doctrine that's contrary to
[1:44:00] what we've already received
[1:44:04] that's what the bible says that that is
[1:44:06] someone that would be a curse
[1:44:12] and the one that knows
[1:44:14] to do right but doesn't do it
[1:44:17] is a foolish man
[1:44:21] and also foolish means
[1:44:24] the church that remains in the great
[1:44:26] tribulation
[1:44:28] they're foolish
[1:44:37] so we have to get serious here
[1:44:40] coming out coming outside
[1:44:42] and just walk seriously with god
[1:44:45] we one day took a decision
[1:44:47] to follow the word
[1:44:49] to follow the word
[1:44:53] so let's be sure
[1:44:55] what is it that we're doing amen
[1:45:12] there's a great immense heaven that's
[1:45:14] awaiting us
[1:45:17] if your neighbor doesn't want to line up
[1:45:19] with the word
[1:45:26] may we keep going forward with the words
[1:45:28] brother
[1:45:41] he says in christ is the word
[1:45:45] so what brother branham says
[1:45:46] what the bible says
[1:45:49] that's what we're following amen amen
[1:45:52] is that true
[1:45:55] let's uh bride keep going forward let's
[1:45:58] uh be encouraged
[1:46:02] let's follow the the advice that's
[1:46:04] always been given to us
[1:46:08] how can we spiritually grow
[1:46:10] let's uh if you
[1:46:19] he says
[1:46:20] read and pray every day
[1:46:22] he says read your bible
[1:46:24] and pray
[1:46:37] lord god
[1:46:46] i hope that these mispronounced words
[1:46:52] could have been helpful for someone
[1:46:55] no no no no
[1:46:56] no
[1:46:59] we have nothing else to point the people
[1:47:02] to
[1:47:03] palabras but only to your word boy
[1:47:16] at their own level
[1:47:33] [Music]
[1:48:04] the only thing that we can do is just
[1:48:05] repeat what's already been stated
[1:48:07] [Music]
[1:48:11] and possibly what we did say was
[1:48:12] something new for someone else
[1:48:16] because they never had the chance to be
[1:48:18] able to hear it
[1:48:23] we asked that let it be a help for them
[1:48:27] for them that have already heard it
[1:48:30] is
[1:48:33] maybe it's a reminder of what they had
[1:48:35] heard and read before
[1:48:38] may you help them in their faith
[1:48:40] [Music]
[1:48:44] today we come lord
[1:49:17] [Music]
[1:49:26] but pressing on to california

[1:49:34] [Music]
[1:49:36] because inside of us
[1:49:37] [Music]
[1:49:39] lies reasoning
[1:49:40] and
[1:49:41] [Music]
[1:50:26] [Music]
[1:50:35] if we can all stand for the word and do
[1:50:38] what's right
[1:50:39] [Music]
[1:50:41] that's what a church needs
[1:50:43] to continue forward
