[Music] they all right I greet all of you and the the lovely name of the Lord Jesus what a privilege for your pastor to invite me to come first time I've visited you here in this first time I've visited you here in this Tabernacle and I remember the first time I came to Phoenix Phoenix it was brother ber that invited me to come and I came in his convention and spoke at his convention and brother John before the Lord took him home I was speaking at at at Israel in two song and he came to the services and he wanted me to come and have some services with him and now your pastor here amen but Octavio has invited me so I really appreciate this and I I don't want to be guilty of leaving any confusion behind I pray is that God will bless all of you and I know that Israel introduced the brothers like brother whisper whis and certainly um I'm honored to be here tonight and of course we represent two big languages I represent the French language and it's huge in fact about 2third of all the Believers following this message is in the French speaking countries of the world so if you take all the languages Portuguese Spanish Russian English yes the French we bypass all of that a part of the reason is because of the Central African countries we we've got but we no one knows for sure but there's over two and a half million Believers of this message in the Central African countries and most is in and those are French speaking countries we are certainly grateful to God for what he has done and I am I'm the the head of the translation I got a great responsibility love you all and I consider you all God bless you did I say it right yes all right so we don't want to waste too much time I think sister sister Sharon Johnson in the meeting tonight is she here Sharon Johnson she rais the hand is she oh well sister Sharon Sharon I will never be able to forget you and brother M you hold a special place in my heart and it's really an honor to see her here tonight with us and of course my buddy and friend brother Mar and his wife my dear wife here amen God bless all of you now we will go straight into the message now and I prayed and asked the Lord to help me to be able to condense it see because that's what God can do God could take something that is really big and condense it condense it and condense it condense it and say it in such a few words that it will take all eternity for all of that to unfold and that's how God is and another thing quickly before we get to this message is that I I don't want to say this to be critical in any way but I've seen brothers that they explain stuff and nobody could understand anything that they say and people call that deep preaching no no the deeper we go in god is the simple it gets it's simple but hidden and because God hides it people think it's complicated it is not complicated it is so simple and we serve a simple God simple people am we simply thank the Lord tonight we praying that God will make it so simple for us and yet yet even though it's so simple it reveals the depth of almighty God thank him for that and again I see brother Amando is he in the back bless him we were with him last night had a wonderful time it's such a blessing to be with you all here in Phoenix in Phoenix you know what brother Bram said of Phoenix Phoenix he said this is the city that I love above all the cities of the world if he said that I have to say Amen it's got to have something special here in Phoenix Phoenix and I'm happy to be here with you all be associated with you amen amen at this time amen and God bless you all now we will stand for a word of prayer father father we approach you tonight and we love you with all our hearts you are our God you are Our Redeemer you our Creator and we have been redeemed by you and we come tonight Lord to express our love and our thanks and our gratitude to you for all things that you have done for us and now father let it not be me me out of the picture Lord and you speak to your people that something will be said tonight Lord that will edify this congregation well bless their Pastor oh God as he Faithfully stands here to minister your word in a time like this it's hard for the for the local pastors help help Lord because you promised to supply our needs him and bless him and anoint this congregation father we wait upon you now in Jesus name amen amen now we will we will take a couple of scriptures and we will go to Mark 12 from verse 29 to verse 31 Jesus speaking and Jesus answered him the first of all the Commandments is here oh Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment and the second is like namely this thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself there is none other commandment Gater than the uh then if we look at Matthew chapter 6 from verse 33 to 34 Matthew chapter verse 33 Jesus speaking here again seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for the moral for the moral shall take thought of the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof all right now um father may you bless your word and bless your people as we thank you in Jesus name amen can be seated God bless all of you now I I know that all of us are aware of the fact that we must put God first but many Christians don't know how to put God first and tonight we want to look at how to put him first trust that will be a blessing to you now I just want to read for you something brother Brandon mentioned here quickly Amen in in the Hebrews and here's what he says he says now friends let's hear him the Holy Spirit speaking in our midst showing diverse Miracles and signs and wonders let's just not pass over it as just come and happening let's remember that it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever confirming his word we must do it oh please do it take heed let every other thing be secondary even your home your husband your your wife your children whatever it may be put it second place God first you say brother brandom over my children over anything Place God first let him be first of course we know that we live in a day where the Prophet tell us children parents will worship their children and sometimes we have parents even in the message that puts their children ahead of God Amen when it comes to a choice between the word of God what what the word of God says God wants and what their children wants sometimes they put put their children ahead and when they do that it displeases the Lord amen we must never put our children ahead of God we must not put our wives ahead of God must first now we could go deep into a lot of that which I'm sure that sometimes your pastor have shared those things with you but there something else I want to share with you that I never knew until this year and that is this amen when the Bible when the prophet tell us we must put God first put God first our family second last we must do that but when we had to put God second excuse me first there is some things that I found out this year I always thought that the problem with with the message or the word of God is people add or take away I always felt that way for many many years it's true there's a big problem with people I didn't take it away I discovered something this year I never knew before and that is sometimes people could take something that is scriptural it is scriptural and they put that first and they put God second let me show let me just show you a little example here as we go a little deeper into this now when Jesus spoke here in Mark 12 verse 29 and 31 amen the Bible says and Jesus answered him the first of all the Commandments is here oh Israel Lord our God is one Lord all right now we get into that and a little later if we have time and thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart all th Soul all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment second is like namely this love thy neighbor as thyself loving your neighbor as yourself god require that we love one another that is the Bible if we don't love one another we displease God but when we put love for one another first God we have first first commandment second second so we kind of we kind of take the second and put it first keep the second second I I've heard people say I love so and so more than I love Jesus Christ to the word of God Jesus Christ must be first like I can say I love Israel I love your pastor here I love brother whisper friend I love brother Amando all of you but my love for God must be first I love my wife I love my children my God must be first because if I love my wife God made her an idol anything that you love more than ID and it is contrary to the program of god let's just let's go a little deeper into that tonight and Paul is speaking about this in First Corinthians chapter 13 now what Paul is talking about here it's scriptural things something contrary to the word take something that is scriptural god require of us to love our while god require children but that must be second does anybody understand now Paul speaking here in 1 Corinthians chapter 13 this is so wonderful amen as we go into in First Corinthians chapter 13 Paul says here do I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity I am become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol speaking in tongues is scriptural if somebody speaks in tongs it is not contrary to the word of God but the danger here is is when we go after speaking in tongues out tell us love here is the Holy Ghost that's why Jesus said seek first kingom of God his else will be so there are things that we have to put first amen even though it's a scriptural even though speaking in tongu is scriptural it must come second program of god let's just go a little further quickly amen just to bring a little examples here in 1 Corinthians 13 and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge so understanding the Mysteries scriptural look if you want a scripture for it if you want a little scripture for it excuse me if we look at Matthew Chapter 13 I'm going to have to hurry here okay are you following me yeah here yeah in Matthew chap 13 and verse 11 Matthew 13 and verse 11 Jesus speaking and he says this I'm sorry I'm sorry I got Matthew I got the wrong scripture here yeah that's correct Matthew Chapter 13 and verse 11 Jesus speaking he answered and said unto them because it is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given if we go up to verse 10 and the disciples came and said unto him why speakest thou unto them in par answered and said to them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given to know the mysteries of godal but here is the danger even in the message when we go after the Mysteries and we leave God out that's the danger then we accumulate knowledge of the Mysteries and where is the spirit of God in our lives we must we must the kingdom of God first the kingdom of God is the Holy Ghost now Paul continues here Paul is warning us of the danger of going after something that is scriptural amen and neglecting God Amen what we have seen happen even around this message we are not saying it is not necessary to understand the M necessary scriptural and God wants us to have know that's why the seals were open when we go into the Mysteries and we don't we put that first we have made it an idol Wars does everybody see it let's go a little further now Paul continues he says and though I have all faith that I I could move mountains and have no charity I am nothing notice notice the language of the Bible notice the language of the Bible and though I had I have all faith I could move mountains this Faith here said it's your Fai it's the Fate you used to do things now what we are trying to do is not put emphasis upon what our faith can do but put the emphasis on what god father fill me with your faith and when God fills you with his faith faith is a revelation of the will of God you put the word of God but people run after the faithful Miracles praise God he heal me wonderful I prayed for a job and he give it to me wonderful my faith produced this produ that wonderful but Jesus said SE ye the kingdom of God it is scriptural for our faith to produce these things amen and God give you the faith the Bible says that every given the measure of Faith it's scriptural God give it to you but it has to be second God must be first all right now let's go a little further down now Paul continued to speak he says and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor giving to the poor is scriptural what is wrong with giving to the poor but here is the problem what we give to the poor thinking in our minds that we will get all kind of spiritual benefit God out about that all right now then he goes on do I give my body to be burned even a m that gives his body to be burned and put God and don't put God first amen Paul warns us against it there's another thing where Christians puts God second and there is a danger with putting God second let me say this before I go into this do you remember that when Israel sinned against God that God told Moses to to build a brisen alar me a brisen serpent put it upon a pole and every one of the children of Israel that looked at the brisen altar what was it brother Bram tell us it was a gift of healing but where was the problem the children of Israel made an idol out of it was given by God Amen God told Moses to do it God can give you certain things things things come God must be first now uh let's go a little deeper okay and I'll read for you some things here quickly I trust this will be a blessing now here is what many Christians when you put God second and when I put God second there are consequences for it amen Excuse excuse me here there is Con quences for it and here's what brother brandham tell us here's the consequence he said now that is what I find among most Christian lives most I hate to say it's that way but it is true the most people that could profess Christianity they seem to have such a hard struggling time to hold on so you meet Christians and they have a hard time you hear them telling you it's a hard time for me hard for me I told the church back home according to this message things should be getting better for you and I to Jesus Christ he gives us more grace he gives us more Victory we grow in the lord it's better for us but the devil tells us it's worse don't listen to the devil Jesus said take my yoke upon you my yoke is easy burdens light but the devil tell you it's Grievious it's heavy don't listen to the devil put God first now brother brandham says here the most people that could profess Christianity they seem to have such a hard struggle in time to hold on I believe it's because of a lack of correct teaching the there's no such a thing as holding on holding on we have to stop and put the emphasis on ourselves that the devil would love for you to do he would love for me to do when our troubles and our trials and all happen in our lives becomes that that's the thing that we are occupied with amen we had this trial and that trouble this trial and that trouble and this trouble and that trouble and this what did the Bible tell us what did Paul tell us amen he said lay aside every weight R the race what does the bible tell us the burdens upon him we here tonight to cast the burdens upon Him brother listen my sister Jesus Christ is more important than any trouble you have Christ is more important than any trial you're going through all you have to do is put him in first place when you put the emphasis on yourself do this I got to do that I got to do this I got to do that then you find yourself struggling you're going up you're going down recognize it's not what I have to do then as the emphasis shifts upon Him amen then we can says Lord It's not then the trials seem to be so huge it's just like when they have this movie King Kong King Kong a big big monster told some little thing they use for that I heard it was some little thing they used for that have to dramatize things it's so hard for you hard poor you sister listen brother sister the Gospel of Jesus not sad news the Gospel of Jesus Christ is good good news Jes lives Hallelujah he is here to deliver us the name of the Lord must be first glory to his name now look let me just read it just a little bit B bit more we got a little bit more time right here brother continues he says here he said there's no such thing as holding on he done the holding on the whole Christian principle is based upon rest come onto me all the that labor and heavy lb come onto me all the that and what's going to happen are you going to continue to carry your burden some come to Jesus and they want to continue to carry the burden all my troubles and my trial this problem hold that problem to me happen what is he going to do I will give you rest he canot lie when we come to him we have got to get rest we must put in order to get that rest put Jesus he is more important all the trials Hallelujah glory to God Amen he is more important than that that Temptation you're going through brother he is more important than the worries you have are you ready to put him first tonight butam continues he says I will give you rest don't have to worry and you don't have to worry and struggle you just rest in that's all give rest rest that's the whole thing is finished let's go on here then brother brandom continues he says and now I find that people so struggle I meet people and they say just such a struggle have you seen people that way and probably there's many sitting before me now that that has their ups and downs ins and outs this day they all right you meet them they love the Lord today and tomorrow they're having such a struggle to hold on the devil is so tempting him and up and down then you meet somebody that's H up all the time brother listen you get up on those hilltops there may be little dips in the hilltops but you still on the hilltop you can rejoice in God why because you [Applause] on because he said cast all your and then and then you're putting God first because when Israel did that they worship the idol God had to tell heahy that thing and praise God any Idol if you if you a true child of God Idol life that you are put in ahead of God you thinking thinking thinking about that when your thoughts be on Jesus Christ word and his Blessing you all in that then God has to put on and destroy the whole thing why because it's contary to God now when we put him first when we come now to put him first we said Lord I'm putting aside everything your will your love you let me share two things with you quickly before I finish brother Bram you hear you brother Bram told us he said my Ministry is to try to unite Brothers together is that contrary to the word amen if I'm here tonight I'm trying to unite the churches together I can unite Brothers together I am absolutely in the will of God but when we speak about the unity W us Unity with God United with God must be first and it is far more important the unity of Brothers together when we put the unity of the Brethren first like like David D did we move away from God it is a scriptural thing and it is good and it is according to God's program not come ahead of the unity amen God must be first because when we put that ahead of God then we will compromise Unity compromise to God now let me let me just read one or two one or two quotes quick quick quick quick quick on that because I see it coming I see doing it listen brother sister your friendship with anybody must not come ahead of God don't let your friendship [Applause] word let me let me read it for you okay I want Unity it's scriptural and we must have it I'll read it for you in the message here God's providing place of worship let me read for you one or two quickly take five more minutes time all the churches come together it's going to be a world Cil churches and Jesus prayed for that that we all might be one but now you see that is caral minded without knowing the spirit Jesus said that there might be one father as you and I are one then he goes on to say here it says here but that you might be one with God like Christ and God was one that's what the prayer is that was the word that Jesus prayed that we might be the word reflecting him that's his prayer to be answered see how Satan scles us up in the caral mind but that wasn't Jesus per at all that we might all congregate together and have a certain Creed and so forth every time they do it they go further and further from God he wants us to be one with God God is the word each individual in his heart must be that one with God so the unity is the unity of God you and I putting him first in all things and when he is put first then the Bible says and the message says he has gotten the preeminence that word preeminence means give him the first place he is the first of all things he is the first in our Liv not our troubles and trials not our good works no gifts or manifestation of God for all of that Jes Christ must be one more quote and I'll finish here as we put him first brother brandham tells us this in Gabriel's instruction to Daniel he says and God and God never did deal with Israel till she come back to her Homeland he thus say the Lord God will not deal with his church until she comes back to the home the message of the hour so if we want God bless us amen we want God to bless our churches bless our ministry bless what we are doing must to that message of the hour when people deviate from the they keep the knowledge is not with them so as I finish we could take things that is scriptural and that God has ordained for us no true Christian is against Unity with one another scriptural friendship is scriptural but when these things come ahead of God we have made an idol out of it though it was given by God and that displeases the Lord and the result is a struggle in our lives there is no peace amen we can't relax in Eno enjoy thejoy our prayer rejoice in the Lord a struggle battle and because God but when we put all these things second must be second first must be first he said father I will see your you and the kingdom of God the Our God one Lord the first and the greatest of all the Commandments thou sh love the Lord with all th Heart All Soul this is the first keep it I love you I love you my sister I love you my brother I love you oh glory to God praise praise praise wonderful Jesus you love him with all your heart tonight all right let's lift our hands let's reconsecrate Our Lives to him all of us here tonight let us tell him God to Heaven let's all stand now let's let's lift our hands Lord God Of Heaven you will be first your message will be first your will is first your love is first your your Fai is first you are first Lord everything is second we put you first in Jesus name I recate my life to and I say to you oh God Heaven me Lord help me Father
