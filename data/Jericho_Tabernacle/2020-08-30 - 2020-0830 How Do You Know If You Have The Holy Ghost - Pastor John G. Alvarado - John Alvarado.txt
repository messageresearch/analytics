present [Music] we're trying to comply with as much as possible we just want to thank everyone today those people that are online we want to thank you also tamina australia after righteousness likewise our now we have we have a message before us here today i think it's a very beautiful glorious message how many believe the word and the message that you have received today how many believe that how many believe that god sent us a prophet how many of you have ever heard the message of the the way of a true prophet so today we're going to try to present something you said he was man that was not nothing to look at he had a beard then he wasn't his appearance wasn't very good but he wasn't interested in their appearance and really really i'm really not really interested uh how i look i'm interested in one thing i want to present to you the message we're so worried about taking a bath every day you know no i'm talking about the soul now your soul and maybe you'll be of the foolish version but we want to be part of the bride of jesus christ we believe every word that has been said and proclaimed to us so uh without any more hesitation here and just get into what i've got to say i know that i'm not normal and maybe you think i'm crazy or whatever you might think about me jose normal but i'm me brother master just be yourself this is but i know i believe a message that god has sent us and i love that message let me explain something to you here let's explain in a minute here i'm going to dramatize something one thing is to have eternal life is to have the baptism of the holy ghost and be placed in the mystical body of the lord jesus christ it's like a person that's justified they just come out of the world they're they receive they believe the message maybe possibly only an intellectual conception but the minute the second that you confess with your mouth you believe you have eternal life how many remember the guy at the cross that was his last and only opportunity and all he did was say jesus remember me is and he says today you'll be with me in heaven it's broken up in two different things though it's it's the same thing now god is eternal god does not have a beginning or heaven but there are people that have or receive eternal life but they do not receive the gene of god but nevertheless there are they are god machine embargoes let's get into this a little bit and let me explain to you entrepreneurs explicit and i i i set it out as a the title of the message as a question and the question is how do you know if you have the holy ghost have you ever asked yourself that yeah amen i have amen you'll see how many believe this message is i always like to reference coats of brother brown so you can see hear it from him and like i've said before if you don't like my style it's not a problem you know brother man would come up to the pope and he said i don't even know what i'm going to say because he was the womb of god come to his mind and then under inspiration he wrote right there deliver the word of god to you and us we have to repeat what he said we can't have our own message so when i get up there i have to be led of god what i'm going to say of course i understand but what i say has to be in accordance then you can imagine a person having the holy ghost and and denying the part of god's word now here's a person says i have the holy ghost and then you deny one word of what he why do you deny so i believe a man ought to live a pretty good life but when we come to a time of thinking about divine healing and all this stuff some people believe that if if they don't smoke or drink or they don't do bad things abstaining from this and that or the other person they're going to merit righteousness they're going to be good you can never be good okay now jesus we find out that he had he has warned us again these last days that these kinds of people jesus yes that they would be so much like the real thing they would be they would absolutely would deceive the very elect ones what is it that's that judas the people that go so far up you know what is the evidence of having the holy ghost that's do not deny not even one word shelf forgot to reveal it to me what is he trying to say i i don't understand god every time i hear him talk i don't understand brother branham every time he is other than believing believing all the word of god and then turn back around and deny the word exactly they have a form of godliness see they have a form of godliness but deny the power of their house so it's a very deceiving age that we're living in it's got to be the word of god applied to you outstanding now i'm going to get into here what i what i want to it's so simple what i've got to say to you so i believe god has the holy ghost for us get up and receive it take it it's yours god will change you transform you and make you a new creature christ jesus now let's listen here how brother brown breaks this down your spirit okay god cannot give you the holy ghost has to give you a new spirit first primero a new spirit spirit vessel oh you made a mistake you sinned he said after you you confessed and you believe you said now you're christian you made a mistake you smoked a cigarette after you said you believed now you smoked a cigarette brother brangham explains all that explicitly he says if you say this is the pekka you're going to pay for it abraham brother she sometimes she doubts what does she doubt he can't do that she doubts who she is you gotta believe who you are you are a son of god by the grace of god let me go back to the show i can plant uh express what i want to say this morning that's the first thing god does to a person he saves them if i can insert the word there justifies him only the sins that they did in the past now in the big now in the future they're going to commit more sins so this justification of the person that's just coming out of the world justification sanctification the new birth of justification now what did i say at the beginning how do we know if we have the holy ghost deny any word that jesus christ as his personal savior and then that person is a person maybe he'll drink a bottle of wine or smoke some cigarettes if you don't obey god god can cut your life off so that person is just barely justified she's going down the street he has an accident he's a christian christian now if i can say it like this the minute you believe this message you are a christian if you believe this message there's no way that you can be lost but one thing is to have eternal life and the other is to have the holy ghost one is eternal life the other one is the holy ghost excuse me now for a second i'm going to get kind of deep here okay it's the book of redemption three things three things redeemed under the sixth heal and they're sealed not with the holy ghost they're sealed with eternal life cannot god bless you sir that's right god bless you that's right that's good uh our heavenly father i now bring each one of you the recording angel standing here taking down every name that's raised their hand tonight to receive eternal life and taking those names who are candidates for the baptism of the holy spirit you hope see how brother brian separates it there comes okay tonight to receive eternal life in those names who are candidates for the baptism of the holy spirit the word said blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled now let's go into the scriptures now then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened into ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and they that were foolish took their lambs and took no oil with them tomorrow but the wise took oil in their vessel with their lamps while the bridegroom terry they all slumbered and slipped all ten versions are saved they all have eternal life i'm gonna dramatize something here in a minute just give me a little just a few minutes be patient with me and at midnight there was a cry made yeah behold the bride can come and go out to meet meet him then all of those are all those virgins rose and trim their lamps and my wife has these candle things where there's there's a fluid on the bottom it's got a wick on top and i try to lit it i try to light it up and then i said i know i have to be cut so i cut i cut it straight and i know how it's supposed to be cut my wife showed me she said it's cut like this she has made herself ready they had oil they ran out of revelation then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps now watch this observe it uh have you ever met somebody that's despotic how many like a person like that i don't you know i like somebody to be you know nice and considerate i don't like rude people amen amen amen i mean okay listen the way the bride is answers the foolish version but the wife answered saying not so much there not be enough for us but go e rather to them that sell and buy of yourself one time my wife was out on the street this lady begger came up to her yesterday i might not quote the mess of the the story just like my wife you can she'll explain to you better and and with something like this she said can you give me some money or something and then my wife said well you know i don't i don't remember what she actually said well i don't have no money or something and the lady got upset and my wife she's very respectful she doesn't like to be rude no legusa but these people sometimes they beg for something they're rude and they almost want to hold you up give me money you know if you're healthy enough to stand here and talk to me you can talk on the phone or be a telephone reception something talk work but look at the answer here what the bible says that the bride told the full inversion i said to he that hears my words and believeth on him that has set me has everlasting life and shall not come into con condemnation but is passed from death and to life de sierto de sierto os digo el que oh yemi palabra ecre alchem if you hear my words believeth on him that's has sent me alchemy has everlasting life in the minute you believe al momento christa you have everlasting life you have eternal life and you cannot be lost and you will not come into condemnation in other words you won't go to the lake of fires and shall not come into condemnation or judgment the bride does not go to the great tribulation she goes in the rapture but the foolish virgin virgins because they have eternal life and they cannot be lost and the other the bride same scripture saint john 5 24. so i have a hard time sometimes i have to ask my daughter how do you say this word i'm i'm like uh tongue tied i can't say certain words i want to read you a word here forgive me because my tongue doesn't help help me to pronounce words but uh let's let's go to the definition of the word now and forgive me for not saying it right i can't i can't i can't help it brother my tongue is tongue-tied the word president okay he says it a lot better listen to it the way he says the definition of this word an early event or action that is regarded as an example or guide to be considered in the subsequent similar circumstances in circumstances now we're not talking about the word president like president trump in subsequent similar circumstances in circumstances so what brother branham says that's what we have to use as a guide is but this system will will not grow out of this cause it's a system of but they're both in the same field watered by the same water regattas and the same sun water by the word and by the holy spirit i just said that one is the word one is not the word and them two are fighting they've been fighting since the first reformation and they're still fighting now i know what brother branham said all right we're not supposed to argue it says he said abraham you say abram he didn't even know himself that he was a warrior he was a soldier and being a soldier he said he went after his nephew he went to a battle he went to fight for apeliar to come after lot look the the way of a true prophet when he comes to see and when he comes on the scene he's always against the system and he is [Applause] you say brother johnny you're fighting now this is established god sent us a prophet the way of a true prophet he comes out and with a sharp edged sword and he just attacks okay since they've been fighting since the first reformation reformacion martin luther martin luther he stood up and the other is not the word and they're still fighting brother johnny you're fighting brother johnny we shouldn't be fighting okay i'm gonna i never attack anybody for their doctrine been very watchful in hearing what i'm saying everywhere that i'm saying brother bram said this i believe that the trinitarians have eternal life what okay brother brab says decent amount of random some people believe out there they believe in three gods but they're gonna have eternal life [Music] i don't find anybody against if they believe something different than what i believe what i am against is the spirit you know you could be right in your doctrine i'd rather be i'd rather be right in my spirit and wrong than my doctrines you gotta have the right attitude in the right spirit why would he attack them [Music] if [Music] and it all started because of jealousy it began in heaven remember that remember that and the devil wanted to be co-equal with god el diablo when we come down to the garden of eden what happened in the garden of eden let me read he's ready to shoot the dark of lust and hate and envy at your heart right now you've got to have a shield of faith the shield of the power of god in your life to shoot off all those darts that come against you every day every minute tell me the devil's not real no existence i fight with him every minute and it came why did one boy kill another boy then the lord said unto him where is your brother and he said i don't know look at the attitude here fix the latitude what a cocky video obnoxious attitude and that many people are not i don't know brother where's your brother i don't care i don't know i'm busy with a lot of people i have to go work take care of my wife maintain my house my kids he said i don't know am i my brother's keeper bad attitude huh god forbid that we take an attitude like that right i don't know i'm not thy brother's keeper he said what about what have i done what what have you done the voice of your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground the spirit el espirito cries out to me klama and i noticed that uh it was pretty late when i come up here i told the brother of what what i only got 30 minutes now and he said no brother you know don't worry about that just get up there and talk or something like that so bear with me okay just a bit of patience okay just bear with me a little bit sorry so i can bring my thought across to you well leave soon we won't be here all along um brother branham elementary i think this is questions and answers no they're asking them a question are the five folded versions of matthew 25 counted as a gentile remnant they say mano bran ma caso la cinco they are part did he obtain eternal life will he cease to live one day he's your turtle that's what you got to understand one face of god he is so good to us even some of us it's not by marriage it's the grace of god okay but have to go through the great tribulation period correct what would be their final destination could they be the sheep which are divided from the goats in matthew 25 33 and 34. las vegas and the foolish virgins are the goats what are you today are you allowed escorted you forfeit your rights to accept all the word of god it doesn't say like this it says how i believe it to be okay do you want to be a sheep or a goat okay pretty good theologian according to what um think it too uh they are the remnant the sleeper version is a remnant spoke of revelation that kept the commandments of god and have the testimony of jesus christ a woman will take a piece of good and lay it down okay how many just heard what i just said sentence as i a said takes a piece of good and lays it down now i'm going to dramatize something to you and i'm repeating myself here i know that and some people say why do you repeat so much okay so i'm going to dramatize something here let's i should have had a little table here and bear with me here i'm not a woman but right now i am a woman you're a woman i'm part of the bride of jesus christ and spiritually we're all women okay he's coming for a bride i want to be part of that bride now how many are familiar with uh brother ma'am says a piece of good and saves it down to someone i asked my wife for this she says well everybody knows what that is so i know but i still want to show it everybody knows what this is this is a pattern and what is this yes this is a pattern to make a wedding dress and you lay it down on the table you put the little pins around it you don't even know how you don't even have to know how to sew okay or i even know how to make a dress put all the pieces together and you'll form a wedding dress and the bride right now is being dressed with a wedding garment and where is that wedding dress every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god did you understand so now we're trying to make a wedding dress now now here's all these goods you know brother rats did all these goods you know there's different cloths and everything and the other day i went to uh i went with my wife to sas you know uh how do you know what sasses how many men know what sauces wow thank you brother that's good that's awesome brother um so you take your wife to sauce is where they sell materials and the sewing equipment there's no excuse for a sister to show her knees [Laughter] brother johnny you're so mean and so angry i am outside you act like a little child because i i am home i'm a young person you know the young people they're somewhat crazy right oh hey young people i was do you think an old man is going to jump down he's going to jump down but he's going to shatter every bra but the youth are the strength and one day it will get to that place where everyone i know you his face is all marked up the other uh day i said to my wife can i use sandpaper on my face i have my face it's all marked up [Laughter] i don't know if you can't see it yes it's a bride brother do you have that picture up there can you put it up there for me let me come back to the slide here that's the bride of jesus christ because i don't have a lot of time i've got to do this real quickly i can't i can't go in the details but the woman cuts the pattern and how does she cut the pattern she choosing a her choosing like god chose us by his choosing you never chose him you'll never marry will do nothing did you hear brother louise the other day wasn't that awesome i love it i love the word of god that man is called of god to pray yes i didn't all he does is just pull out this pull out that pull it out and just shoots it out some people get up here they can't even talk to them i know it's a process okay let's go back to the style game i just cut it out look mellow corte wow i didn't even need to cut it like this but it's like a capstone it's completely that's what it is we're in the capstone age is this is going to be the wedding dress hallelujah we're going in the bride we're going in the in the rapture hallelujah this is the whole message right here this is all the messages i told there is to it and that's where so many people are wrong they're wrong completely wrong this message is not only for the bride brother branham said he called him on the bride the third pool for the bride for the church and for the total loss but this too is eternal wow i cut it out like a heart that's what god wants you he wants your heart look at david david david was a man after god's own heart david conformed what he was a liar a murderer an adulterer brother brahm city with god deleted because they are part of i love same material no difference oh that's sister she's full of virgins she's lower please don't judge bro if someone obtains eternal life it's by god's grace okay now here again the ones that have eternal life are millions millions and millions and millions will have eternal life and the bride ilanovia is just a little tiny little group and if you don't believe me i'm going to tell you what brother said wow this oh that's right brother oh you know whatever he said there you're right it's it's 7 000. and then brother bob said it again was corrected again we kept saying seven hundreds and the last quote i read were they correct brother branham and they said they told him brother branham it's seven thousand that's what the scripture said that they then did not bow their knee to bear bow my god and what do you have to do you say i'd be happy just to have eternal life just to know that i'm going to exist forever and if i do make it on the bride it's only grace upon grace upon grace solo is gracious no one puts himself in the bribe your name was written in the left book of life before the foundation of the world and you were already cut out of the pattern that's bear with me because it's already time for me to get down but i'm going to keep reading here well now what what's she cutting takes her pattern and lays it anywhere she desires which which way she's going to cut that and by one spirit we're all baptized into one body of that holy spirit is spiritual which is eternal life because jesus said jesus here's my word and believe it on him has eternal life amen remember what brother louise was telling us the other day now that is that is in in this here is when you accept jesus as your personal savior personality you are a christian at that time okay let's say yesterday some person was drinking and gambling and carousing and everything in a mess is christian now he's barely justified justification brother branham said listen to them you are a christian at that time the one with you accept them as your personal timer personality he's already saved he's got eternal life well you should do this johnny you should do this for them to come to the feet of jesus christ here it is so many 50-somethings i don't know how many years after brother branham has already gone off the scene look at the hour we're living in a whole bunch of people coming in brother brahms it is an individual affair worldwide one by one by one comes to the feet of jesus christ so when did you have eternal life you always had eternal life you just have to recognize it and understand that you are eternal and if you have eternal life you will come to this mexico i don't have to do anything fancy one way or another you will come to the feet of jesus christ you might have an accident okay an accident you might lose your job you might lose your wife but it's god working on you to put you in the right frame of mind of thinking to come to i believe you'd be saved god jesus christ don't people read the message i believe you'd be saved that's that's what dying thief did at the cross yes come to me not long ago i said i got one on you preacher brad branham no se mucho una fundamentalista vino ami medico aura tengo i gotta crack my neck here this is this is a mind blower you mean you become an enemy of god and god will still save you so why don't you back off brother sister we're always putting down on the foolish virgin siempre estamos contra you try to manufacture him manufacturer brother you need to speak in tongues you need to shouting screaming yeah no you don't no no we don't want to manufacture anyone if you have is after all he did did not commit suicide hey and everyone that is saved i am so happy thank you jesus that you saved this guy he said no good for nothing low down but you saved him god by the grace of god thank you jesus i don't know but i just say thank you jesus for your plan thank you for your planet you go after your children you pray for them amen i believe that many thousands of turning people who believe in 23 gods is saved come against me come to me and you don't even realize no you're saying that theirs no i'm one of them no you know some of them do you think i tell you everything not even if i was crazy what happened to samson never give out the secret i believe that many thousands of 2010 people who believe in three gods is saved many trinitarian people that believe in three gods i lost my place i believe that many thousands of people who believe in three gods is saved so god cannot lose you after he saved you but he can shorten your days here proceed and make you pay for everything you've done said when abraham got out of the promised land for all the wrong that you do you're going to pay for it miraculous look what brother branham did god punished him took away her daughter took away his wife come on brother come on prince god doesn't impute any sin to me i mean the bride also sins and don't worry whatever you plant what you saw is but lord i don't understand why did this happen to me why this is what's your own fault does that mean that you're lost no it doesn't that doesn't take away from
