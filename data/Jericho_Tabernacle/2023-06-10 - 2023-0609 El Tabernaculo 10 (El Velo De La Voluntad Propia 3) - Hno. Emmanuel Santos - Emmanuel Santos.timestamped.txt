[27:49] [Music]
[28:11] foreign
[28:44] [Music]
[28:49] [Music]
[29:00] brother Brandon calls it an omnipotence
[29:03] [Music]
[29:04] this is a word that's also in us
[29:07] which is possible
[29:43] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[29:46] amen amen
[29:51] she says you're standing we're going to
[29:53] be reading two scriptures
[29:56] the first is in Hebrews 10 19.
[30:09] the Bible says
[30:17] having therefore Brethren boldness to
[30:19] enter into the holiest by the blood of
[30:21] Jesus
[30:28] by the new by a New and Living Way which
[30:30] she have consecrated for us through the
[30:32] veil is to say his flesh
[30:36] and having a high priest over the house
[30:39] of God I said
[30:48] let us draw near with the true heart and
[30:50] full Assurance of Faith having our
[30:52] hearts sprinkled from an evil conscious
[30:55] and our bodies washed with pure water
[31:00] now in second Corinthians 3 14.
[31:13] but their minds were blinded
[31:17] foreign
[31:31] and in English it says their minds were
[31:34] blinded
[31:37] they cannot receive it is
[31:48] but uh which remaineth for until this
[31:52] day the same Veil untaken away in the
[31:54] reading of the Old Testament which Veil
[31:56] is done away in Christ
[32:02] but even unto this day when Moses is
[32:04] read the veil is upon their heart
[32:09] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[32:11] Lord the veil shall be taken away
[32:14] it goes to the first veil of the outside
[32:18] you receive it in your heart
[32:20] but in order to receive it in your heart
[32:23] you break the veil okay
[32:28] God bless the reading of his word
[32:36] this evening I want to continue the
[32:38] theme of the veil of self-will
[32:41] that's a name okay
[32:44] brother Brian I'm assigned to that Veil
[32:46] yeah
[32:49] I'm going to read it from Revelation
[32:51] chapter four number two
[32:56] then how do how do we get into this
[33:01] now remember there was a veil um
[33:05] available
[33:19] Christ is enthroned who comes in
[33:23] metolistas
[33:29] whoever will
[33:35] you know what that you know what that
[33:38] Veil is that veils your heart from it
[33:40] are you ready
[33:43] the veil is called self-will
[33:47] all right
[33:49] now like we studied in the past and
[33:52] those velos there's two veils
[33:55] the exterior Veil is
[34:03] we could see that the outside Veil
[34:05] represents this body
[34:06] represents this flesh
[34:08] and the inside
[34:10] but the brand-up teaches us
[34:13] he calls itself
[34:16] now when a person is born in this world
[34:20] they're born with both fails
[34:23] and both veils are very similar
[34:41] thou shall make the Tabernacle with ten
[34:44] curtains
[35:16] of man
[35:34] which is the outside Veil is
[35:38] it has a worldly nature
[35:46] another quote in the same message
[35:48] countdown uh this is
[35:53] notice the natural man even counts
[35:56] backwards
[35:58] I said he did things backwards
[36:01] he counts backwards
[36:11] 654-3-20
[36:14] see he goes back
[36:16] and starts counting
[36:22] he's all 10 is a bad number that's right
[36:26] to start with 10 is a bad number
[36:31] they had ten tribes of Israel
[36:34] and that was just all Cardinals
[36:39] so you can see that this Veil
[36:42] that was made of ten curtains is
[37:00] this body is a fleshly body
[37:06] it's not subject to the things of God
[37:09] when someone's born again
[37:13] you fight against your body
[37:18] you've got two types of natures the
[37:22] spirit of God
[37:23] inside your heart
[37:27] but you still have to deal with this
[37:29] worldly body
[37:39] [Music]
[38:12] it takes you out
[38:15] of this worldly uh this fleshly world
[38:22] now that's the first veil of the outside
[38:27] now let's go back to Exodus 26 3.
[38:36] now when that Veil from the outside is
[38:39] opened
[38:40] and it creates five and five grace and
[38:44] grace
[38:45] now verse
[38:48] [Music]
[38:50] now when it speaks of the first five
[38:52] this is
[38:59] the five curtains shall be coupled
[39:01] together one to another and the other
[39:04] five curtains shall be coupled one to
[39:06] another this is
[39:17] and thou shall make loops loops of blue
[39:19] upon the edge of one curtain of the
[39:21] Selvage and the coupling and likewise
[39:23] thou shall make in the uttermost edge of
[39:24] another curtain in the coupling of the
[39:27] second
[39:40] 50 Loops that are making one curtain and
[39:43] 50 Loops shall thou make in the edge of
[39:45] the curtain that is in the coupling of
[39:47] the second that the loops may take hold
[39:49] one of another
[39:52] now when that Veil is turned into five
[39:54] and five uh
[39:57] the Bible says in verse
[40:02] it says that it'll have 50 Loops
[40:06] the number 50 is the number of what
[40:57] or not
[41:16] it
[41:21] also has 50 loops
[41:29] Exodus 26 6. this is
[41:40] and thou shalt make 50 taxes of gold and
[41:43] couple the curtains together with the
[41:44] tattoos and it shall be one Tabernacle
[41:48] now both those five
[41:51] they're works of redemption
[41:54] it's the Redemption of the soul
[41:57] and the Redemption of your body
[42:00] it gives you an internal Grace
[42:04] and a Grace to take you out of this
[42:06] world
[42:12] from your sinful condition
[42:15] and also give you a jubility
[42:19] that'll free you from this world of sin
[42:21] literally
[42:23] take you out of here
[42:26] one takes the world out of you
[42:29] and what will make you come out of the
[42:32] world
[42:33] you're literally ascend
[42:36] already say s
[42:39] now when both fives
[42:42] they joined together again
[42:46] since there's 50 Loops
[42:49] it says they had to use touches of gold
[42:55] they'd couple each one
[42:57] both curtains
[43:02] with those golden touches
[43:06] because gold represents deity
[43:09] it represents God's spirit that's in you
[43:13] so when you receive the Jubilee
[43:16] and then you bring both jubilees
[43:18] together
[43:23] and you'll be with God yes
[43:25] it's a jubilee from God
[43:29] a specific Jubilee
[43:32] of the Holy Spirit
[43:38] was 50 blue loops
[43:53] it's the color of Truth
[43:58] this is UNA Gracia so what is Grace
[44:01] one of The Graces
[44:05] we'll give you Fellowship in truth
[44:08] the second grace will do the same
[44:11] and as he joined them both
[44:15] there's a portion of the Holy Spirit
[44:18] there's a work of the holy spirit
[44:20] that will join both yes
[44:23] it's by the holy spirit
[44:27] so those 50 tattoos of gold
[44:31] it's
[44:36] a jubilee of the Holy Spirit
[44:42] the way the Holy Spirit operates
[44:45] it's through faith
[44:50] nothing can be done without faith
[44:56] there's something that brother Branham
[44:58] teaches
[45:01] something that always stood out to me
[45:05] speaking about the denominations
[45:07] he said that for 2000 years
[45:11] the same Holy Spirit
[45:15] has been adapted or has been bound
[45:22] by denominational beliefs foreign
[45:41] but the same holy spirit
[45:43] it's got a jubilee
[46:42] so come to me and save me
[47:17] they make both Graces that you have
[47:21] be a work of the Holy Ghost in your life
[47:33] they say
[47:35] is
[47:41] the spirit of the Lord God is upon me
[47:43] because the Lord hath anointed me
[47:49] decorations
[48:00] to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and
[48:02] the opening of the prison to them that
[48:04] are bound
[48:09] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[48:11] Lord
[48:14] now Jubilee is
[48:19] through the preaching of the gospel
[48:22] God anoints a man
[48:25] to speak the words
[48:28] then you believe the words
[48:31] now you in believing the words
[48:36] you're anointed by the spirit
[48:44] it has an anointing
[48:47] it's
[48:48] a very powerful anointing
[48:51] and that anointing is
[48:53] it's through faith
[48:57] you should believe if you believe
[49:01] you activate that anointing in your life
[49:06] that anointing separates from you
[49:10] that anointing is the Holy Ghost it's
[49:14] the anointing of faith
[49:25] you limit the anointing
[49:27] foreign
[49:46] the anointing of the Holy Ghost
[49:51] foreign
[51:32] Faith Can See Beyond
[51:36] and you can see yourself healed
[51:44] will make what's in your heart
[51:47] be manifested in your body
[51:56] let's go to First Peter 1 23.
[52:07] that's in you okay that's in your heart
[52:12] it's a seed of faith
[52:15] foreign
[52:43] but of incorruptible
[52:49] by the word of God which liveth and
[52:51] abideth forever
[52:53] first of all since we're born again
[53:01] it's the word of God
[53:12] but it hasn't grown to a complete
[53:15] maturity
[53:17] that's why you have trial after trying
[53:20] and you also receive blessing upon
[53:23] blessings
[53:25] just like the same is is nights the day
[53:30] comes again and the Night Comes again
[53:33] so come the blessings of God and also
[53:36] the test is
[53:40] it's causing the seed that's within you
[53:43] to reach a full maturity
[54:15] because it's a seed of faith
[54:20] in Galatians 3 16
[54:25] now to Abraham and who is Abraham
[54:28] the father of Faith Abram foreign
[55:21] but it's there
[55:23] faith
[55:53] Faith causes that
[55:56] is
[55:58] why we're the seed of Faith
[56:02] Abraham is the father of the faith
[56:06] so Abraham had to wait 25 years
[56:11] the Bible says he did not doubt in faith
[56:17] what you need is
[56:21] up there further ahead
[56:27] and
[56:29] makes it come to a present time
[56:32] Faith believes
[56:35] up there in the future
[56:44] but you know God does fulfill his
[56:47] promise
[57:07] it can see beyond
[57:12] Faith doesn't speak to this mouth
[57:14] but it can't speak
[57:17] Faith Can't touch with his hands but it
[57:21] can touch God
[57:22] in another way
[57:28] we've got five natural senses
[57:34] where the seed of faith is
[57:45] and he calls it the Holy Spirit
[57:48] and when you yourself
[57:51] because it's the veil of self-will
[57:56] you want to live by the five outside
[57:58] senses
[58:00] or do you want to live in the holiest of
[58:02] holies
[58:04] and the sense that's found in there is
[58:06] Faith
[58:07] so if you live in the holiest of holy
[58:17] Faith
[58:20] tells you that what's out there in the
[58:22] future it's something sure
[58:28] you buy your decision
[58:31] you decide where you want to live
[58:34] they're in the veil in the outside
[58:37] well you've only got the five senses
[58:40] or do you want to live in the holiest of
[58:42] holies
[58:46] that's super sense
[58:49] can speak to God can
[58:53] touch God
[59:19] protects
[59:22] where you go
[59:30] a person that's been born again
[59:33] can live in various places
[59:35] in both places
[59:39] because we're still in this body
[59:41] Cristiano but also Christians that's
[59:45] been born again
[59:48] can take the self-decision
[59:54] when you do that
[59:57] is
[59:58] it's easier for God to speak to you
[1:00:02] it's easier for you to receive God
[1:00:06] but when you're out in the outer courts
[1:00:09] and God wants to speak to you
[1:00:13] honestly you don't really pay attention
[1:00:15] you don't want to listen
[1:00:18] you're very focused on the things
[1:00:20] outside
[1:00:21] the outside world
[1:00:26] your whole mentality
[1:00:29] all your thoughts is
[1:00:37] the revealed word that's what feeds you
[1:00:42] well you can also live in the outside
[1:00:44] world
[1:00:46] and feed the black dog
[1:00:50] this body is the black dog
[1:00:53] but the seed of faith is
[1:00:56] the white dog
[1:01:00] feed the white dog
[1:01:02] and the black dog will be silent
[1:01:05] but now you feed the black dog pero
[1:01:08] Blanco the white dog
[1:01:11] will have tons of difficulty to overcome
[1:01:58] [Music]
[1:02:04] you've got the seed in you
[1:03:03] is to have fellowship with God
[1:03:33] surrender to God
[1:03:56] that's where that seed is
[1:04:00] that's your decision
[1:04:04] because myself personally
[1:04:09] I felt so so filthy
[1:04:12] by the things that I've done
[1:04:16] I've said I've seen
[1:04:19] there's other times
[1:04:23] not to boast about myself
[1:04:27] I feel like the devil can't even bother
[1:04:30] me
[1:04:37] [Music]
[1:04:39] sometimes I feel so filthy for being out
[1:04:43] there
[1:04:44] then there's other times
[1:04:47] I feel so clean
[1:04:49] I I did I clean my own self sure I did
[1:04:53] it well it was him
[1:04:56] but I made the decision
[1:04:59] I broke the Veil
[1:05:15] or do you want to live in the Holy place
[1:05:22] the affections
[1:05:26] or you want to live in the holiest of
[1:05:28] holies
[1:05:29] the sense that's there is faith
[1:05:46] or
[1:05:53] the single sense
[1:05:56] that's in the holiest of holies
[1:06:04] can control the rest of the senses
[1:06:22] it's just you and him
[1:06:26] beautiful
[1:06:34] Elementary the notice brother Branham
[1:06:37] says
[1:06:39] I'm going to read the the quote who is
[1:06:42] God
[1:06:43] this is
[1:06:45] when the inspiration of the holy spirit
[1:06:47] is
[1:06:48] here to inspire you remember remember
[1:06:53] God will make your body
[1:06:56] come into your confession
[1:07:17] into the outer courts
[1:07:20] foreign
[1:08:44] [Music]
[1:09:17] through the super sense of faith
[1:09:30] this body has to obey
[1:09:35] light
[1:09:56] giving God times
[1:09:58] if you don't give God time
[1:10:01] then you won't get fat
[1:10:03] Omni potential you won't cause that
[1:10:06] omnipotence
[1:10:07] to start to practice
[1:10:10] that's already in you
[1:10:12] you've already got a tree
[1:10:14] potentially in the form of a seed
[1:10:18] you've got the power potential
[1:10:21] potentially foreign
[1:11:33] this world doesn't affect you
[1:11:57] if you live in the holiest of holies
[1:12:00] live by faith
[1:12:02] that's the battle
[1:12:20] is practice
[1:12:35] for whatsoever is born of God overcometh
[1:12:38] the world
[1:12:38] what is Born
[1:12:41] overcometh the world
[1:12:47] and this is the victory that overcometh
[1:12:49] the world even our faith
[1:12:53] and the seed that's within you is a seed
[1:12:56] of faith
[1:12:57] when you're born again
[1:13:01] it starts to grow is
[1:13:06] it starts to gain practice
[1:13:11] it starts to know what are the its
[1:13:13] abilities
[1:13:15] just like a person that plays Sports
[1:13:18] and the more they practice
[1:13:20] they get better
[1:13:23] they know more what they
[1:13:52] and he tries to grab the handle
[1:14:14] and what you cannot do
[1:14:17] it
[1:14:18] you're practicing
[1:14:32] to practice your faith
[1:14:57] for now
[1:15:00] you're the one that's got to open the
[1:15:02] door
[1:15:04] just like you see you're moving through
[1:15:06] the room
[1:15:07] and then the baby gets to the door what
[1:15:11] does the baby do the baby wants to get
[1:15:13] out
[1:15:14] it turns to look at mama and papa
[1:15:19] they've got the power to open the door
[1:15:25] you've been born again
[1:15:27] you're practicing faith
[1:15:34] and you know what God can do
[1:15:50] don't allow them to discourage
[1:15:54] after some time that babies got there
[1:15:57] crawling then it's walking then it's
[1:16:00] running
[1:16:03] a motorcycle
[1:16:10] faith is advancing
[1:16:21] now that seed that's in you
[1:16:24] the equivalent to that
[1:16:29] the vocabulary of the Tabernacles
[1:16:32] is the Ark of the Covenant
[1:16:35] the branches that the art is the word
[1:16:40] he says that the ark also represents the
[1:16:42] heart
[1:16:46] was not the only thing in the holiest of
[1:16:48] holy
[1:16:51] it had a lid on top of it
[1:16:55] which on English is called The Mercy
[1:16:58] Seat
[1:17:15] it's Hollow
[1:17:18] it's
[1:17:19] God's Throne
[1:17:22] a place already designated for him
[1:17:47] was above that Throne foreign
[1:18:26] a place separated for God
[1:18:31] now what's required is you break the
[1:18:33] veil
[1:18:34] surrender to God
[1:18:36] and your spirit will come
[1:18:40] so that sea that's already in you this
[1:18:43] is
[1:18:49] doing whatever you please
[1:19:03] voluntarily unto God
[1:19:05] the light comes
[1:19:09] and it activates what's already there
[1:19:13] not that it's going to play something
[1:19:15] there I'll go something's already there
[1:19:18] is
[1:19:23] the holy spirit's just activating what's
[1:19:25] already there is
[1:19:27] it's the seed of faith
[1:19:41] I'm going to Omit a lot
[1:19:45] we're going to go to the communion
[1:19:48] paragraph 45
[1:20:15] that William Branham isn't the same one
[1:20:18] tonight
[1:20:19] if someone someone back there would say
[1:20:22] William Branham
[1:20:24] William Branham he was a ranked
[1:20:29] scandala Branham a rank Rascal C because
[1:20:32] I was born of Charles and Ella Branham
[1:20:35] and in their nature I was a sinner
[1:20:39] I came to the world as a liars
[1:20:44] and all the habits of the world laid
[1:20:46] right in me
[1:20:48] but down in there
[1:20:52] other nature present bienada see
[1:20:56] predestinated
[1:20:58] in there by God
[1:21:01] in this same body
[1:21:04] two Natures
[1:21:07] well I only cater to one
[1:21:12] I could as a baby daddy
[1:21:16] yeah but first thing I know
[1:21:18] I became a liar
[1:21:21] become everything that's a sinner
[1:21:24] because I raised up that way
[1:21:29] but down there was a little speck of
[1:21:31] Life all the time what was it
[1:21:34] Branham there was another William
[1:21:36] Branham
[1:21:43] see a little spot of eternal life down
[1:21:45] there
[1:21:47] from the genes of God
[1:21:51] the word of God was placed in there
[1:21:55] each one of you can think of similar
[1:21:58] things
[1:21:59] see it was working
[1:22:02] then I look up to the trees and I think
[1:22:09] you fall last year and why are you back
[1:22:11] there again
[1:22:14] who brought you here
[1:22:18] you see it was that eternal life working
[1:22:21] in the body
[1:22:23] and one day as I walked on
[1:22:26] that voice talking
[1:22:31] so foreign
[1:22:51] there's something
[1:23:11] there's something in me calling Anton
[1:23:13] says then I was born again
[1:23:18] that little life was laying there
[1:23:21] the life of water was poured upon it
[1:23:25] then it began to grow is
[1:23:36] to never be remembered again me no more
[1:23:40] now we're Justified
[1:23:43] as if we never sinned
[1:23:46] in the presence of God
[1:23:50] foreign
[1:24:07] to govern my life
[1:24:11] you've got two parts in you
[1:24:15] you can be born again
[1:24:18] and struggle with the things of the
[1:24:20] world
[1:24:21] because this body is
[1:24:23] this body is carnal
[1:24:27] but you can get to the point
[1:24:30] where you live in the holiest of holies
[1:24:34] and everything that happens
[1:24:37] everything that dominates
[1:24:40] everything you can see is
[1:24:43] by faith
[1:24:45] but it requires practice
[1:24:53] a man to live by faith is the father of
[1:24:57] Faith Abraham
[1:24:59] Lafayette the face
[1:25:03] or that anointing I mean
[1:25:05] where the brand also calls it the Holy
[1:25:08] Spirit that's in you
[1:25:11] what that Faith also does
[1:25:14] it offers a protection
[1:25:25] to the things of the world
[1:25:31] you can get to the point where you live
[1:25:33] so much by faith
[1:25:36] honestly there's not many things
[1:25:39] or nothing in this world
[1:25:42] that can affect you
[1:25:47] you'll have to overcome
[1:25:49] but it'll get to the point
[1:25:53] you live so much in that Holy place
[1:25:57] that faith will overcome every
[1:25:59] circumstance
[1:26:01] every one of the five senses
[1:26:05] they'll have to respond to the super
[1:26:07] sins
[1:26:12] was Abraham
[1:26:16] when the Bible speaks of the armor of
[1:26:18] God when it speaks of faith
[1:26:22] it says it's the shield of Faith what
[1:26:25] does the shield
[1:26:28] it's used during the time of battles
[1:26:31] and it's used as protection
[1:26:34] and that's what faith does for you
[1:26:37] Faith
[1:26:40] the darts of the enemy will come
[1:26:43] the enemy will come to attack
[1:26:45] but your protection
[1:26:51] that's already in you you've already got
[1:26:54] it
[1:26:55] you just have to practice
[1:26:59] how to use the shield
[1:27:03] in Genesis 15 1
[1:27:21] after these things the word of the Lord
[1:27:23] came unto Abram in a vision saying
[1:27:28] fear not Abram I am thy shield
[1:27:33] and they die exceeding great rewards
[1:27:38] the seed that's in you is
[1:27:41] the word of God
[1:27:43] it's the seed of faith
[1:27:47] and God is the word
[1:27:56] that God placed in you yes
[1:28:00] it works as a shield it protects you
[1:28:15] you get discouraged terribly discouraged
[1:28:19] you've got no faith
[1:28:29] but you keep believing in God
[1:28:35] Abraham was a man of faith
[1:28:37] God tells us to Abraham isn't it it's in
[1:28:41] Genesis
[1:28:43] and God says I am thy shield
[1:28:47] and you're exceeding great rewards
[1:28:51] and God proved this to Abraham in
[1:28:55] the previous chapter
[1:29:18] he was exposed to the things of the
[1:29:20] world
[1:29:23] and he was taken prisoner by the kings
[1:29:26] of various nations of the world
[1:30:02] or stay where he was
[1:30:07] since Abraham live by faith
[1:30:12] he didn't care the risk of death
[1:30:17] he went and rescued his nephew
[1:30:24] even though there were many more with
[1:30:27] the other nations
[1:30:30] I believe the Bible says there were only
[1:30:32] 300 men that were with Abraham
[1:30:35] but since Abraham live by faith he knew
[1:30:38] this
[1:30:39] God was faithful to his words
[1:30:42] God made the promise
[1:30:45] he would give him that promise
[1:30:49] so since he knew God would give him that
[1:30:52] promise
[1:30:59] and he was going to go to that battle he
[1:31:02] was going to rescue
[1:31:04] and there was nothing nothing that would
[1:31:06] touch him
[1:31:08] because Abraham live by faith
[1:31:11] that's why in the next chapter
[1:31:14] School God told him I am your Shield
[1:31:19] we can imagine
[1:31:32] when I went there
[1:31:34] frequency I went with faith
[1:31:37] I knew you wouldn't let me die
[1:31:41] there was a pending promise that you
[1:31:45] still owe me
[1:31:46] I promise there's promises in your life
[1:31:50] so when the tests come the battles come
[1:31:54] have faith
[1:31:55] God is faithful to his word
[1:32:00] do you confront the enemy confess with
[1:32:03] faith
[1:32:05] there's no way that situation can die
[1:32:08] you live by faith
[1:32:11] God will give you the reward
[1:32:41] [Music]
[1:33:03] that you won't like it
[1:33:19] that's where faith is
[1:33:23] that makes contact with the world of God
[1:33:27] the only way you can come in contact
[1:33:29] with God is through faith foreign
[1:33:50] answer you
[1:33:52] there's two omnipotence
[1:33:55] God over there out there
[1:34:00] trying to speak to the god that's in you
[1:34:03] and it's not you that believes in God
[1:34:07] it's the sea that's in you that believes
[1:34:10] in God
[1:34:30] is
[1:34:35] break the vent break the Veil
[1:34:40] and believe in God
[1:34:44] in believing in God
[1:34:47] he'll bring you in he'll submerge you
[1:34:49] into a world of Faith
[1:34:52] where everything is possible
[1:34:54] not everything is instant always
[1:34:57] possible everything is possible
[1:35:02] that's why it's necessary
[1:35:05] to live by faith
[1:35:08] let us all stand
[1:35:19] let us pray
[1:35:21] Heavenly Father
