[28:12] at the cross where i first received my
[28:14] sight in la cruz
[28:18] that's what uh calvary does for us
[28:22] it gives us our sight
[28:25] it allows us to see
[28:28] what a beautiful thing god has given us
[28:30] amen
[28:33] so good to be here in the house of the
[28:34] lord once more
[28:38] to fellowship and to give god all the
[28:40] glory amen
[28:44] amen let us go straight to the
[28:46] scriptures
[28:49] if you would like to turn with me to
[28:51] saint john
[28:54] juan
[28:56] chapter 14.
[28:59] verses 16 all the way to verse 26.
[29:06] whenever you have it just go ahead and
[29:07] say it man
[29:14] and the bible says
[29:18] and i will pray the father and he shall
[29:21] give you another comforter that he may
[29:23] abide with you forever
[29:32] even the spirit of truth whom the world
[29:35] cannot receive because he
[29:37] it seeth him not neither knoweth him but
[29:41] ye know him for he dwelleth with you and
[29:44] shall be in you
[29:46] spirit
[29:51] pero vosotros
[29:56] amen that's why i like that song
[30:00] at the cross in la cruz where i first
[30:03] received my site
[30:06] this comforter
[30:20] i will not leave you comfortless i will
[30:23] come to you
[30:27] get a little while and the world sees me
[30:29] no more but ye see me because i live ye
[30:32] shall live also
[30:41] now notice this at that day ye shall
[30:44] know that i am in the father and ye and
[30:47] me and i in your
[31:07] he that
[31:08] he that uh
[31:10] that hath my commandments and keepeth
[31:12] them
[31:14] he it is that love with me
[31:17] and he that loveth me shall be loved of
[31:19] the father and i will love him and i
[31:21] will manifest myself to him
[31:42] and he'll be loved by my father
[31:46] and i will love him
[31:48] and i will manifest myself to him
[31:53] now um
[31:55] here a disciple asked a very good
[31:57] question
[31:58] this
[32:01] judah saith unto him not iscariot lord
[32:04] how is it that thou will manifest
[32:07] thyself unto us and not unto the world
[32:16] then jesus tracks back and says exactly
[32:19] what he said in the beginning
[32:23] [Music]
[32:25] jesus said unto him if a man love me he
[32:29] will keep my words and my father will
[32:32] love him and we will come unto him and
[32:35] make our abode with him
[32:46] he that loveth me not keepeth not my
[32:48] saints the word which ye here is not
[32:51] mine but the father which sent me
[32:59] these things i have spoken unto you
[33:01] being present with you
[33:06] but the comforter which is the holy
[33:09] ghost whom the father will send in my
[33:12] name
[33:13] he shall teach you all things and bring
[33:16] all things to your remembrance
[33:18] whatsoever i have said unto you
[33:21] el consolador el espiritu
[33:38] comes in the name of jesus christ
[33:42] so we don't have to separate the holy
[33:44] ghost from jesus
[33:49] that holy ghost that deals with you
[33:50] today
[34:04] heavenly father celestial lord we just
[34:07] want to give you the preeminence this
[34:09] evening father father
[34:14] lord that you may have the revelation in
[34:16] our lives father

[34:23] to serve you the way we want to father
[34:26] libertad
[34:29] lord i ask that you just take each and
[34:31] every person here lord
[34:35] persona
[34:36] lord each and every spirit under your
[34:38] control father spirit
[34:40] control lord that you may speak through
[34:43] i and the the interpreter
[34:49] lord that you may
[34:51] just give us what we need lord jesus
[34:57] we thank you we give you the glory
[35:01] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[35:05] amen and amen amen
[35:07] amen you may be seated
[35:10] my title this evening
[35:14] is the revelation for everyday life
[35:20] the revelation for everyday life
[35:25] you know um
[35:27] one of the hardest things i've seen in
[35:29] my christian life
[35:35] genuine people
[35:40] serve the lord
[35:52] one day they just go out into the world
[35:58] [Music]
[36:07] this is a message directed to the young
[36:09] people
[36:12] but i pray that god just puts it in each
[36:14] and every heart
[36:18] that receives it
[36:20] but but a young people
[36:22] uh we are raised in the message
[36:50] and as as we grow up as young people
[36:55] we we look like christians
[36:59] because that's what our household
[37:02] has us to do
[37:06] we're subject
[37:10] so the young sisters they they look like
[37:12] uh uh christians
[37:16] foreign
[37:34] of the world
[37:43] they walk according to the word of god
[37:56] and i've seen many young people yes
[38:00] where they begin to serve the lord
[38:30] because you go to church every every
[38:32] week
[38:34] because the way you dress
[38:38] doesn't make you a christian
[38:42] christian and telling somebody to act
[38:44] like
[38:51] [Music]
[38:57] [Music]
[39:10] a personal revelation in my
[39:37] my family my family my my my sister
[39:54] a person
[40:06] and she would tell me how much she loved
[40:08] the lord
[40:12] and every time something would happen
[40:15] she would she would be ready to pray for
[40:18] it
[40:21] but there was one day
[40:24] one day everything changed
[40:27] where she cut her hair off
[40:31] she put makeup on
[40:34] she started wearing pants
[40:40] because i said
[40:42] this great christian that i saw before
[40:44] my eyes
[40:48] what happened to her
[40:50] it was because she was never a christian
[40:54] cafe cristiano she was never converted
[40:59] she was doing it because she that's the
[41:01] way she was raised
[41:07] parents can raise their children
[41:12] as best as they can or close to the
[41:14] world
[41:17] but as soon as rock and roll music
[41:20] enters into the ears
[41:25] it'll catch that little spirit
[41:29] because we are bored with that nature
[41:31] porque nace con
[41:34] it's nobody's fault
[41:36] it's not that poor young person's fault
[41:41] it's their nature
[41:44] their nature to serve the things of the
[41:47] world
[41:50] amen amen
[41:52] i i had a really good friend of mine
[41:57] man we used to run around when uh when i
[42:00] was out in the world
[42:10] but then i gave my heart to the lord
[42:14] and i don't know how but i i ended up
[42:17] picking him up and taking them to my
[42:18] house
[42:23] and i we i gave him something to eat
[42:26] and then we begin to talk
[42:34] and i don't know how long or how many
[42:36] times he went to jail in my period of
[42:39] serving the lord no
[42:40] tiempo
[42:42] la carson
[42:46] but it allowed him to
[42:49] to read the bible
[42:53] okay i just got nervous because i didn't
[42:55] see the clock there my position
[43:04] and he told me that he read the whole
[43:06] bible
[43:09] and and
[43:10] his conclusion was conclusion fue that
[43:14] nobody could live up to the bible
[43:17] standards
[43:21] there is nobody that could live up to
[43:23] the bible standards he told me
[43:59] [Music]
[44:34] we could be as faithful as possible
[44:38] but yet our spirit is still
[44:42] held on to the things of the world
[44:47] brother branham says in impersonation of
[44:50] christianity
[44:52] personification christianity he said
[44:56] now he's he's talking about uh people
[44:59] that are struggling to serve or the lord
[45:02] yes
[45:15] impersonation of christianity
[45:21] i'll go over and join but i tell you and
[45:24] stick your head in yoke with christ
[45:38] and then you begin oh it chats my
[45:42] shoulders it hurts my
[45:43] social prestige
[45:52] the people i once associated with pass
[45:54] me by and say yeah there she is she's a
[45:57] holy roller last person
[46:05] there he goes see um he john don't come
[46:09] to the pool room anymore
[46:12] juan
[46:36] then the yolk is lined up with fat lined
[46:39] with feathers oh my haciendo
[46:45] no matter what the word calls you it
[46:47] don't make
[46:48] oh i backslid because i tell you i
[46:51] couldn't stand for them to call me this
[46:52] or that or the other no important
[47:02] you've never got the mainstream put
[47:05] mainspring put in the middle of
[47:08] um
[47:09] of this of his spirit in the middle of
[47:11] your spirit
[47:19] see you had a false impersonation
[47:33] you just you just accepted the emotional
[47:35] side and never got the real side us
[47:44] religion religion
[47:46] called formal religion religion free
[47:48] formal to follow the word
[47:55] it'll cage you up just like the world
[47:58] will cage you up
[48:02] this message
[48:19] i don't like anything bound down
[48:20] shackled down.
[48:26] put you in mind of cold formal religion
[48:28] that shackles you and binds you
[48:31] mentality
[48:35] but i don't like that um like
[48:38] that
[48:38] whosoever the son has made free is free
[48:41] indeed that's right just take your
[48:43] liberty
[48:46] gusta
[48:55] [Music]
[49:12] what a horrible feeling it is
[49:29] is the feeling of being trapped in
[49:32] religion
[49:36] i hate that
[49:38] it it just makes me crawl
[49:41] it makes my my my
[49:50] [Music]
[49:53] whenever my
[49:54] spirit didn't align with his spirit
[50:15] i would try everything i could to not be
[50:17] a christian
[50:21] christian
[50:22] whenever i was in in church economy
[50:37] and i was a completely different person
[50:42] because that's not what i wanted
[50:46] my spirit thirsted for the things of the
[50:48] world
[50:52] so so whenever uh we say not to do this
[50:56] and not to cut your hair and not to do
[50:58] this
[51:02] and we begin to create a very decent
[51:05] looking sinner
[51:32] therefore if the sun makes you freely
[52:02] it's the
[52:23] jesus says in john 8 32 jesus
[52:28] and ye shall know the truth
[52:57] you shall know the truth
[53:02] and when you know it
[53:05] it shall make you free
[53:08] well we've been raised in the message
[53:12] we've
[53:26] you know what the bible says
[53:29] you know what's right and what's wrong
[53:32] but do you know the truth but
[53:37] i can intellectually know the bible yo
[53:39] intellectual producer but if i don't
[53:43] know the truth
[53:46] i'm still caged up
[53:48] i'm still not free
[53:51] the
[53:52] devil knows the truth
[54:05] satan builds his church do you know what
[54:08] satan builds his church off of satan
[54:14] satan builds his church on the word of
[54:17] god
[54:21] when i heard that i was like ah that
[54:22] doesn't sound right
[54:26] but then he says but
[54:31] god builds his church
[54:35] upon the revelation of the words
[54:39] there's a big difference exists
[54:42] to know the truth
[54:44] and to really know the truth
[54:48] i can know the bible
[54:50] and i could be the worst sinner in the
[54:52] world
[54:55] my buddy me amigo i don't know where
[54:58] he's at
[55:00] my heart goes out to him
[55:02] because he's he did so much good things
[55:05] for me when we're out in the world
[55:11] i pray he's still alive
[55:14] i pray that god has mercy on him
[55:18] but he read the whole bible when he was
[55:20] in jail
[55:24] he probably knows the bible better than
[55:26] i do
[55:28] but he doesn't know the truth
[55:32] he doesn't know he does not have the
[55:34] revelation of the word
[55:39] the devil can go round and round around
[55:42] with the word
[55:46] with the bible
[55:57] of why not to do certain things
[56:03] we remember that scripture in matthew 16
[56:06] 15.
[56:09] when jesus begins to ask his disciples
[56:14] who
[56:15] [Music]
[56:24] [Music]
[56:27] some say you're this great prophet
[56:32] some say you're there some say or that
[56:37] but then he turned to peter and he says
[56:39] who do you say that i am
[56:53] and jesus says jesus
[56:56] blessed peter blessed thou art peter
[57:00] for flesh and blood hath not revealed
[57:03] this unto you
[57:06] flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[57:08] you
[57:22] you can hear the messages every sunday
[57:25] every uh wednesday and friday
[57:31] but it's not me who gives you the
[57:33] revelation
[57:36] it's not brother branham who gives you
[57:38] the revelation
[57:42] flesh and blood cannot give you
[57:44] revelation
[57:47] but it's from our father up in heaven
[57:52] not even jesus could give peter that
[57:55] revelation
[57:58] why jesus was flesh and blood
[58:02] he couldn't teach him a revelation
[58:35] when jesus began to say if you you uh do
[58:38] not eat in my flesh and drink of my
[58:40] blood you have no part with me jesus
[58:46] brother says people began to think he
[58:48] was a vampire man
[58:52] people thought that he was a crazy man
[58:56] they they didn't catch the revelation
[59:01] but peter pero pedro somebody
[59:13] of who jesus christ was is
[59:44] my father which is in heaven revealed
[59:46] the thing to you
[59:50] that he is the word of god
[59:54] it's a personal revelation
[59:58] it's something that brother branham says
[1:00:00] this
[1:00:03] is he says that if it would have been a
[1:00:06] revelation to the whole church
[1:00:12] when peter would have received that
[1:00:13] revelation juan pedro uh um
[1:00:17] that whole church would have been saved
[1:00:21] but that revelation was just for peter
[1:00:26] pedro now what is revelation revelation
[1:00:30] now i i know i'm speaking to people that
[1:00:32] know all right
[1:00:35] but i just want to speak to the young
[1:00:37] people
[1:00:39] what is
[1:00:40] revelation
[1:00:42] the greek word for revelation
[1:00:46] is apocalypse it's apocalypse
[1:00:49] that's that the world is terrified of
[1:00:52] that word
[1:01:07] it's just uh kind of funny yes
[1:01:11] i believe that the devil made it that
[1:01:13] way
[1:01:14] okay el diablo
[1:01:16] cause people to
[1:01:17] um
[1:01:18] be afraid of that word
[1:01:33] that the whole church is built upon
[1:01:35] revelations
[1:01:39] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:01:42] against it
[1:01:46] revelation revelation
[1:01:48] the devil cannot prevail against
[1:01:50] revelation
[1:01:54] so the whole world is running away from
[1:01:56] apocalypse away from revelations
[1:02:02] but the bride lives off of revelation
[1:02:15] now the greek word for revelation is
[1:02:17] apocalypse
[1:02:31] and it means apocalypse
[1:02:34] it's like a a a sculpture has made a
[1:02:37] great statue
[1:02:43] and he's got it covered by a veil
[1:02:47] and then he goes and tears back this
[1:02:49] veil and reveals what's behind the veil
[1:02:54] it's an uncovering
[1:02:58] that's
[1:02:59] as simple as it is i sit in the u.s
[1:03:02] that's what revelation is
[1:03:06] is whenever
[1:03:09] you young sisters
[1:03:13] struggle
[1:03:14] to um wear decent clothing
[1:03:20] you young men
[1:03:22] struggle to act like a christian
[1:03:26] christian struggle to to uh not go with
[1:03:31] the trend of the world but i am paranoid
[1:03:36] it's hard it's defeating it's hard but
[1:03:39] and we have these questions
[1:03:43] why why do i have to be this way
[1:03:47] why do i have to act this way
[1:03:51] and maybe we don't ask anybody
[1:03:55] but it's a question on
[1:03:57] why can i just do this
[1:04:02] why where in the bible does it say i
[1:04:04] can't wear earrings
[1:04:08] where in the bible i can't do this or
[1:04:10] that and don't
[1:04:37] without revelation it'll never work
[1:04:42] without the understanding
[1:04:45] without jesus christ in your life
[1:04:49] it will never work
[1:04:52] i could try and try and try to be a
[1:04:54] christian
[1:04:57] christian and i know not to smoke and
[1:05:00] drink and do drugs
[1:05:04] but do i really have the revelation
[1:05:10] of why a christian acts the way he does
[1:05:16] when we talk of revelation
[1:05:20] people start
[1:05:34] gloria
[1:05:36] but where's the revelation on acting
[1:05:38] like a christian bro
[1:05:43] where's your revelation on everyday life
[1:05:48] uh how to overcome every single day
[1:05:54] that's where our revelation shall lie
[1:05:58] in contrast
[1:06:00] now i know time is slipping by jose
[1:06:04] so i'm just going to
[1:06:06] go over things real quick
[1:06:10] but
[1:06:11] the greatest revelation brother branham
[1:06:13] says this
[1:06:15] is the greatest revelation
[1:06:19] is the supreme deity of our lord jesus
[1:06:21] christ
[1:06:25] amen amen that's the greatest revelation
[1:06:30] brother berlin
[1:06:40] you can you've got to believe that in
[1:06:43] order to get to first base
[1:06:48] peter says in the message uh
[1:06:50] uh patma's vision
[1:06:55] that's what peter said
[1:06:57] repent and see the deity
[1:07:04] be baptized in the name of jesus christ
[1:07:06] for the remission of your sins and ye
[1:07:09] and then you're ready to go in the
[1:07:11] spirit
[1:07:24] because we all know that scripture is
[1:07:29] when peter says repent um and be
[1:07:32] baptized with the uh
[1:07:34] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:07:40] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[1:07:42] holy ghost
[1:07:44] but brother branham inserts a quote here
[1:07:50] he said peter said to repent
[1:07:54] and then see the deity
[1:07:58] so when do you see the supreme deity of
[1:08:00] jesus christ
[1:08:03] when do you receive that great
[1:08:05] revelation
[1:08:09] when you receive your new birth
[1:08:12] brother branham says in in the uh christ
[1:08:14] is the mystery of god revealed el
[1:08:16] monobram lo this element
[1:08:19] what is the new birth then you see
[1:08:22] entonces
[1:08:30] it is the revelation of jesus christ
[1:08:32] personally to you
[1:08:37] so the whole church is built upon
[1:08:39] revelation
[1:08:43] jesus
[1:08:45] he is the mystery of all things jesus
[1:08:50] he is the mystery of everything
[1:08:53] every tree that you see
[1:08:57] that when you see the sky
[1:09:00] when you see nature
[1:09:03] when you look at time
[1:09:06] when you read from genesis to
[1:09:07] revelations
[1:09:10] is an apocalypse it should scream out
[1:09:12] jesus christ
[1:09:15] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:09:20] so whenever you receive christ in your
[1:09:22] heart
[1:09:24] you'll receive the word of god in your
[1:09:27] heart
[1:09:29] he is the fullness of the word
[1:09:47] pray to the lord or el senor to ask him
[1:09:50] for a revelation
[1:09:53] and he will give you that revelation
[1:09:57] amen amen
[1:10:00] the revelation is the new birth
[1:10:05] because it's the word becoming alive in
[1:10:09] you
[1:10:12] the revelation of jesus christ is the
[1:10:15] new birth
[1:10:19] birth is what
[1:10:20] becoming alive
[1:10:24] being born
[1:10:27] that's it's the word the letter is
[1:10:30] becoming alive in you
[1:10:34] so whenever the word is revealed in you
[1:10:40] it becomes alive in you cobra
[1:11:09] it becomes alive in me than me and then
[1:11:13] i i'm the walking word
[1:11:16] then nobody has to tell me not to do
[1:11:18] this and not to do that
[1:11:21] because it's alive in me
[1:11:30] he continues in the crisis the mystery
[1:11:32] of god revealed
[1:11:36] now all the quotes most of all my quotes
[1:11:38] is from that
[1:11:54] he was in the psalms
[1:11:57] he was in the history of the bible
[1:12:00] the prophetic um the bible is a
[1:12:02] prophetic book
[1:12:05] it's a historical book
[1:12:07] historical it's a book of love
[1:12:10] it's a book of songs
[1:12:13] it's a book of life
[1:12:15] and there you find christ
[1:12:20] that's
[1:12:27] amen amen then if he is that now listen
[1:12:30] to this
[1:12:32] song then if he's the principal theme of
[1:12:34] the bible
[1:12:45] [Music]
[1:12:53] amen he should be the principal theme of
[1:12:55] our life amen
[1:12:59] if he's the principal theme of the bible
[1:13:03] and the bible is in us
[1:13:07] then he should be the principal thing of
[1:13:09] every thing that we do say or think
[1:13:13] entonces
[1:13:29] of who jesus christ is personally to you
[1:13:34] then he'll be the principal theme of
[1:13:35] everything
[1:13:39] then the world will just push out of you
[1:13:44] then
[1:13:58] freedom in
[1:14:10] then the minister can say go out and
[1:14:12] drink tonight
[1:14:26] anymore
[1:14:28] then the devil can tempt you with
[1:14:29] everything everything that the devil can
[1:14:31] throw at you
[1:14:36] on on acting like the world a cerca de
[1:14:38] comportando
[1:14:40] acting like the
[1:14:54] you
[1:15:20] amen amen
[1:15:22] then it's freedom entonces
[1:15:25] that's the worst thing i i could put on
[1:15:28] anybody
[1:15:31] brother branham says a wishy washy
[1:15:33] christian is the most miserable person
[1:15:35] on earth
[1:15:49] he doesn't know if he's in the world or
[1:15:50] he doesn't know if he's with god
[1:15:55] he's double-minded
[1:15:58] mentally he's trying to
[1:16:00] juggle the world and god
[1:16:06] but whenever you give it all to the lord
[1:16:10] by your choice
[1:16:13] by you understanding why
[1:16:17] then it becomes something different
[1:16:23] now i realized this thing when brother
[1:16:25] branham was saying this
[1:16:30] that the daily life of the old testament
[1:16:32] saints
[1:16:35] santos testament
[1:16:37] in their daily lives
[1:16:41] dwelt the mysteries of god
[1:16:45] that's pretty
[1:16:46] amazing in their daily life in their
[1:16:49] daily walk in succumbing
[1:16:53] now it's hard to kind of understand this
[1:16:58] because all we see is the what's written
[1:17:00] of them
[1:17:05] but when moses
[1:17:07] when he saw that burning bush
[1:17:10] when moses had to walk to egypt
[1:17:14] when moses was rejected by the people
[1:17:19] every day he had a certain struggle
[1:17:24] um david whenever he was rejected by his
[1:17:26] own people
[1:17:43] maybe they didn't know or maybe they did
[1:17:47] but in that everyday life
[1:17:51] dwelt the mysteries of christ in that in
[1:17:54] abitaba los misterios
[1:17:56] whenever
[1:17:58] moses got angry
[1:18:01] and he smote the rock
[1:18:04] he was just angry
[1:18:06] not knowing that there was going to be a
[1:18:08] rock smitten on calvary
[1:18:14] his actions was the very mystery of
[1:18:16] christ
[1:18:20] whenever joseph was was there in prison
[1:18:34] not knowing that it was going to be
[1:18:36] christ that was going to be crucified
[1:18:38] for us since
[1:18:50] and that's why christ is in every
[1:19:19] christ was in their daily life
[1:19:23] now if he's the principal theme of their
[1:19:25] lives
[1:19:29] he has to be the principal theme of our
[1:19:30] lives
[1:19:33] then we in us
[1:19:47] in your
[1:19:48] decisions
[1:19:50] it's it's a prophecy it's a prophecy
[1:19:53] it's a reflection it's a reflex of jesus
[1:19:56] christ
[1:19:58] amen amen
[1:20:01] brother branham says
[1:20:04] look christ in you makes you the center
[1:20:06] of life of the revelation
[1:20:16] the center el centro it makes him the
[1:20:19] center of all revelation in you
[1:20:26] now i just got to say this again
[1:20:30] the word isn't rules
[1:20:33] the bible isn't rules
[1:20:36] it's a love story
[1:20:39] it's a book of psalms
[1:20:43] and look at what he says here
[1:20:46] what is it it's christ being revealed
[1:20:49] and he is the word
[1:20:54] and when the word is revealed it
[1:20:57] expresses itself
[1:21:02] so when you allow this word
[1:21:04] to be alive to be revealed in you
[1:21:10] in your daily walk
[1:21:12] whether it's a great big revelation or
[1:21:14] it's just a revelation to overcome that
[1:21:17] day
[1:21:19] revelation
[1:21:22] it expresses itself
[1:21:26] then it's not you trying to to fight
[1:21:29] against the current entonces
[1:21:33] but it's the word becoming alive and
[1:21:35] expressing itself through you
[1:21:40] expressed amen amen
[1:21:44] amen
[1:21:46] brother branham says do you see the man
[1:21:48] of branham if you say he's been revealed
[1:21:51] to me
[1:21:54] and then the life of christ produ um the
[1:21:57] life that christ produced here in the
[1:21:58] bible
[1:22:04] that the same life is is in him does not
[1:22:07] produce itself in
[1:22:14] [Music]
[1:22:18] then he
[1:22:19] continues in the message of the great
[1:22:21] commissioner
[1:22:33] a revelation of christ that brings the
[1:22:35] results
[1:22:40] what makes you act like a christian is
[1:22:41] the revelation of jesus christ
[1:22:48] i always thought
[1:22:50] i always thought it took a certain
[1:22:52] different revelation for everything
[1:23:00] i thought if you had to overcome smoking
[1:23:02] or drinking your pencils
[1:23:17] it's just a further revelation of who
[1:23:20] jesus christ is
[1:23:22] revelation
[1:23:25] when you understand how much jesus
[1:23:27] christ loves you
[1:23:30] if you understand how much jesus christ
[1:23:33] is interested in your everyday life
[1:23:39] when you understand that jesus christ is
[1:23:41] with you every step of the way
[1:23:58] when he's cheering you on though every
[1:24:00] step
[1:24:12] then listen so many people has got the
[1:24:14] wrong conception
[1:24:33] you say we make converts to christian
[1:24:35] christianity by his government that's
[1:24:37] not it
[1:24:43] well they're not supposed to drink
[1:24:45] buenos air
[1:24:47] tomato they're not supposed to lie
[1:24:51] do you know the mohammeds can outshine
[1:24:53] you
[1:24:56] respond
[1:24:58] you know the heathens in africa them
[1:25:00] black men they they've got laws
[1:25:03] among their tribes that outshine
[1:25:05] anything you can produce in christianity
[1:25:09] in africa
[1:25:36] we're not in the age of telling somebody
[1:25:39] not to do this
[1:25:43] because brother branham says that
[1:25:45] there's heathens that can outshine our
[1:25:47] lives
[1:25:54] that can live better and pure lives than
[1:25:56] a christian can live question
[1:26:01] christianity so i can reform or myself
[1:26:04] to become a christian
[1:26:06] you know
[1:26:22] god is making himself known
[1:26:26] not not we're supposed to make converts
[1:26:29] to christianity by a government case
[1:26:45] as god was in christ christ in you
[1:26:50] and what did god do in christ what did
[1:26:52] god did in christ
[1:26:55] oh wait when when what god did in christ
[1:26:58] god christ does in you
[1:27:03] what signs did god uh what what signs
[1:27:06] did god do in christ christ does in you
[1:27:13] oh isn't that beautiful
[1:27:15] oh my i like that
[1:27:18] i mean
[1:27:19] brother branham once says
[1:27:22] he started to talk about how jesus
[1:27:24] christ if you like to stand and the
[1:27:26] musicians would like to come up
[1:27:30] brother branham talked about you cannot
[1:27:32] put new wine into old wineskins
[1:27:40] you cannot put new wine into uh old
[1:27:43] bottles
[1:27:58] that they would use cowhide
[1:28:03] they would use that leather
[1:28:06] and and and that's where they would put
[1:28:08] their wine
[1:28:12] but if that leather that cowhide was old
[1:28:15] and dry
[1:28:20] it would break every time you put new
[1:28:22] wine in there
[1:28:27] because wine is a type of revelation
[1:28:32] and well wine does it's it's a ferment
[1:28:35] it's a fermented drink
[1:28:39] it's not like water no escomolagua it
[1:28:42] expands and it grows
[1:28:46] and it produces carbon
[1:28:49] dioxide
[1:28:52] carbon dioxide
[1:28:53] so it it causes the bottle to expand
[1:28:59] but if that old if that bottle is old
[1:29:05] that life is old
[1:29:07] it cannot take the revelation
[1:29:12] but whenever you make a new life
[1:29:16] when you get a new wine
[1:29:20] that has life inside of ita
[1:29:35] a certain way
[1:29:50] you won't
[1:30:05] but you allow that new life to come
[1:30:07] inside you pro
[1:30:10] and whenever the word says to do
[1:30:12] something
[1:30:15] whenever the word says it's wrong to do
[1:30:17] another thing
[1:31:15] martin luther wesley pentecost martin
[1:31:18] luther wesley
