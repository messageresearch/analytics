the lord jesus christ amen amen let us turn our bibles like to thank the lord as always for the life that he always gives us gives us and also our pastor brother johnny for the trust that he always has towards us may the lord keep blessing him amen amen uh saint mark fifth chapter on the 35th verse capitalism while he yet spake there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain how certain which said thy daughter is dead why troublest thou the master any further um amen you may take your seats hey man once again it's real nice to see you here again um and i hope that all of you feel very good hey man are you you are happy to be here right because we're we're happy because we know he's here if he wasn't here well i'll we'll definitely be sad and so scripture tells us where there's two or three gathered in his name he said he'll be there that settles it that's it there's nothing else to it don't that's that's it he's two or three gathered in his name amen if i could place a title to our uh message this evening and i kind of want to in a certain way uh continue what we spoke about two weeks ago with the guidance of the lord and i'd like to grab my title there from the 35th verse and your husband doesn't doesn't treat you right to esposo why do you keep going with those religious fanatics i'm not sure you've been told that before i hope you understand what i'm saying you have said to yourself why do i keep going why do i keep listening to the tapes why do i keep reading the bible if this is still the same she doesn't change my marriage is still a wreck my daughter doesn't want to get right [Music] my son is doing this and sometimes those demons come to you and it says your daughter is dead you know she might not be physically dead but sometimes those demons tell you what she's spiritually dead she's not coming anymore for your husband anymore there's no more hope for your marriage but notice what jesus says on the 36th verse be not afraid only believe be not afraid only believe and the winds are tossing back and forth back and forth and you feel like you're a ship alone in the ocean i'm just rocking you back and forth you wake and you see your dad acting a certain way why do i keep doing it then this is all in vain do i just go to church in vain they told her they told this person your daughter is dead but notice that the one who gave the life we notice on the fifth chapter there on the first verse [Music] here mark begins to explain the scripture like we read two weeks ago about the maniac and cadera the el hombre el gadareno but here mark begins to kind of narrate a little bit more in detail and it says here it is on the sixth verse but when he saw jesus afar off cuando vio pues a jesus de lejos let me let me go for the fifth verse and always night and day he was in the mountains in the tombs crying and cutting himself with stones so notice this is the this is the the maniac and guidera and just that that was possessed with allegiance [Music] and cutting himself with stones you know a lot a lot of the times we i remember i was in school and i was sometimes this i always see young girls mainly young girls they want to you know the guest that satisfies them and i always always tell them why do you do that because it feels good and some will say because some will tell you flat out because they try to kill themselves i begin as as the masses begin to reveal itself i started to notice that it wasn't themselves and it says but when he saw jesus afar off he ran and worshiped him you notice here in the sixth verse he ran he worshipped and he cried with a loud voice said what do i have to do with the jesus jesus all the devils besought him saying send us into the swine that we may enter into them in four weeks jesus gave them leave and the unclean spirits went out and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea they were about two thousand and they were choked in the sea jesus is and they that fed the swine fled and told it totally in the city and the country and they went out of this out of the sea what it was that was done so notice here that the swine asks jesus well lord if you allow us to enter in those wine and the lord gave them permission and here it says and it says he be in the legion sitting and clothed in the right mind he is and they saw and told him how it felt to him that he was possessed with the devil and also concerning the swine concern and they began to pray to him depart out of their coasts and when he was coming to the ship he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him so he'll notice here what jesus says how about jesus suffered him not but saith unto him the capitalists how great things jesus has done for him and all men did marvel says and i'm not sure what message he says it uh of you dyeing your hair you want to go diet i'm not sure what brother brian says about it he's our great-headed mother they're praying for their sons [Music] here's and then we say lord he gave go back to the scriptures no there's wood and fire up here no is [Music] enemies who's your enemy it's either possessed or to be possessed you're either going to conquer or you're going to be conquered that's a promise to you yes what gate stands before you is they literally there's no question about it and as after jesus finished with this guidera man here comes this man a ruler from the synagogue by the name of jairus but then here came a woman who had a blood issue for 12 years she was being tormented for 12 years and she suffered many things many physicians suffer spend all the money that she had gas and instead of getting better and better for 12 years said if i can only touch his garments if i can only touch him rather his garment almost being supervised and touch his body needs to get up to consequently he doesn't have to look at me he needs to get in again he doesn't know my name just by touching his garments no i will be healed but my question is and she said if i can only touch him and there when he touched him jesus says on the 30th verse and jesus immediately he disciples says jesus come down uh excuse me he says she says why you asked that why are you where do you ask who touched me there's a church full of people here who's touching you this one was different esta because virtue came out of me because they came and the scripture says immediately he knew in himself that someone touched them and then jesus turned and said to her you hoe no dicho because you uh recited so many verses your faith has made the whole go in peace [Music] in the message uh demonology religious realm this is and here come the lowest type of a demon that had a man bound out yonder in the the devil himself said we know who you are you're the son of god the holy one theological seminary preachers uh recognize them to be bells above them which was right the devil or the preacher el diablo was i want to know oh my god i'm talking about you want to cast a demon out hablando de quierendo es how many of you are honest i want to be honest may the lord help me question my youth god is in an honest heart you might stand here us speak big words i don't know what como jonos i love about the brand of preachers [Music] that don't get you closer to god imagine brother standing behind presented before the mirror god bless you brothers and sisters again brother johnny again you can't stand in practice and repeat your sermon and say things that's going to get you closer to god you can learn dictionary you can sleep with the dictionary i'll get you closer to god says submitted hearts repeat that one more time and that's true amen amen a humble heart god loves you no matter if you don't know your abcs that don't make any difference just a humble [Applause] you can become doesn't they came into jairus and they told jesus he says your daughter is dead why troubleless doubt the mastery notice that jesus came and he bowed before jesus and a woman with a bloody should just finish to be healed and then somebody came hello he says jairus if you go hideo your daughter is dead stop troubling the master only she's not and tells her for the first verse which is interpreted it doesn't matter what you say to your own selves you might say why do i keep coming in why do i keep praying and why do i keep doing this and i keep fasting and i keep praying there's only faith so right you've got to have faith you're said to get into faith and you have to stay on that word you've got to fight for it every inch of the way it's a promise to you [Music] because in every service every revival the holy spirit does come down hallelujah but there's twins just like god comes down satan comes down you open up your heart but you got to be very careful because what was we're you think it's the holy spirit [Music] but what and that's how you defeat him because there's demons that are moving right now don't believe him don't [Music] [Music] and they [Music] no no no there is there is someone greater than solomon no uh high blood pressure irreverence because they're moving and then in the mind oh i'm not good for nothing also they think this about me they think that about me [Music] you guys are going to do the same thing with judas he was sitting there with jesus and you open up his heart and the scripture says [Music] no right there [Music] why trouble is now the master any further foreign [Music] he's here don't let your thoughts suspend your demons those demons excuse me no um jesus doesn't love you [Music] [Music] dear lord heavenly father this evening lord we give you thanks the name of the lord jesus christ lord father may you deliver them sen your father because that soul doesn't belong to the devil lord we claim all of these sheep here tonight and washed by your blood lord i present here these people to you father i present
