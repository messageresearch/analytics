morning Lord May their heart be a fertile ground to accept the teaching of your word and then you will send forth your Reigns I will bring the revelation of that which was taught we're asking of your help this morning only you can bring the Revelation yes and that revelation will bring us to a maturity we ask for this Lord the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen is just like we're standing like to only read one scripture and the Book of Joel the second chapter on the 23rd verse foreign once you have it Joe 223 is be glad then hit children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for yet given you the former Reign moderately and it will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of Wheat and the vast shall overflow with the wine and oil restitution Los Angeles I will restore to you the years that the locusts had eaten the canker worm the caterpillar the Palmer worm a migrate Army which I sent among you you should eat planting and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God hath that hath dwelt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed God bless everything of his words as well if you have your Bibles open you can see where it says that those two Reigns that will take you back to the original condition in the beginning then the Lord says that he will restore the Bright Tree he will restore it back to its original condition now there are two trees of Life all those personas or two people okay that symbolizes the tree of life it's a Christian that is Christ has eternal life he's the author of eternal life and you his bride usted you have eternal life Christian you and Christ representative represent that tree of life the tree of life is that eternal life and God says he will restore us back to the original condition to that eternal life in the way that he will do so is using the former Reigns and using the lettering says in the exposition of the seven Church ages of the review of the ages and now it says God is going to restore for he cannot deny his word this is not the resurrection of the church God will take the church right back to Pentecost of the beginning that's with 120 received life and God wants to restore us back to the original condition original the original condition is eternal life Cinco in paragraph 65 this is now notice in verse 25 it tells us why we need restoration is [Music] all but the root in a small bit of the stems now we are told that these insects are all one and the same in different stages that is right they are the Antichrist spirit manifested in organization in latinumination and denomination and false Doctrine Through the Ages you can see what takes you out of that original condition that condition of eternal life is perverting that Eternal world the false Doctrine the incorrect teachings and perverting the word you present a perverted life to the people there is no longer eternal life God wants to restore us back to eternal life and the way that it does he says that here in paragraph 66 but it's going to bring his original planting back to original seeds he's doing it as a stated in verse 23 by the teaching or or temprana or former rain in seguida vendra next will come the Harvest rain or rapturing faith now God wants to restore us back to the beginning the first thing he uses is former ring is which is the teaching Reigns correct if we're turning you back to the right teaching of the Bible getting you back to the right doctrines and teachings of the word then he will bring the latter ring that will manifest that which you were taught the Bible teaches you it says that you're saved by grace the nominations you're saved by writing your name in their book he brought that form of rain that correct baptism of the Holy Ghost that teaches you what's right you follow that process of the the teaching and then God will bring that latter rain okay that will manifest the fruits of that sea that was planted within you each everyone has a seed planted in them it's God's predestinated seats but if you don't have that correct teaching if you don't have that first form of rain that former rain then you cannot receive that lettering that will manifest that was brought to you back in the beginning with the teaching of what's written rapturing faith El Cielo and after this I look and behold the door was opened in heaven is and the first voice which I heard was that wherever trumpet talking to me said which said come up hither dios vares God's going to restore you through the former Reigns it's raptured faith iguan John and type Forest his uh redeemed body was restored and being raptured this body does not have the capacity to go up and have any places but one day you will have a body that will have that capacity you believe in a resurrection you will be in the resurrection you believe in the Rapture you will be in that rapture that you will manifest in that time when John is raptured Cielo he goes up to heaven we know the one who spoke to him was Christ and we see that John going up representative representing the church going up in the rapture okay in our Revelations chapter 4 a throne was in heaven and one sat on the throne is and he said that sap was to look upon like a Jasper and a sardine stone and there was a rainbow around about The Throne inside like onto an emerald remember these Reigns will restore back to the original Italian and we help you manifest the original in the beginning we know that it's Christ it's yours it's God he sees him he sees them in his original condition before the foundation of the world because he sees it back in his original condition in the beginning I made a couple of things but let's go to questions and answers on Hebrews number three yeah this is the beginning we'll go back to our Hebrew teaching just for a few minutes and so forth a rainbow obviously has seven colors but in the next chapter on the fifth chapter he sees the same Throne going to the throne we'll take you back to the first day in his original condition right here when God made Man In His Image and his likeness Genesis Genesis there was no man yet to tell the soils now God had done made male and female and one theophany always teaches us that we were in God before the foundation of the world brings you back to the original condition you are always eternal it brings you back to that original condition s this man had no beginning of days nor End of Days so also Christ glorified not himself to be made in high priests also in another place thou art a priests Forever After the order of Michelson attention so please pay attention [Music] who in the days of the flesh when he had offered our prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears on Tim that was able to save him from death and he was hurt and he and that he feared though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and be made perfect he become the author of Eternal salvation on taught them that obey him if he can say Pablo noticed that Paul wants to enter mourn this topic of melchized but not what it says in verse 11. he said we have many things to say and hard to be uttered the people that Paul is speaking to know he couldn't teach the basic teachings to these people because they did not want to accept the former Reigns and the former Reign is a type of teaching it's uh where they're sowing the seeds they couldn't accept the first Reigns so they cannot receive the second Reigns if you do not accept you must want to have to have to have the Holy Spirit if you do not accept the right teachings you cannot accept the power of that teaching foreign you have made that one teach you again which is the first principles of the Oracles of God and it becomes such as have need of milk and not of strong meat they were not able to accept the basics of the teachings of Paul foreign because the word is not just letter form it's the spiritual it's also spirit Ed how can you accept the invisible Spirits if you cannot accept the word that's written will teach you the principles and here comes the Holy Spirit the Divine portion that will reveal that what was written verse 14. it is full age even those by reason of those who have their senses exercise to discern both good and evil you can see between the lines that Paul was trying to bring a reign of teachings A Reign of Revelation de Cristo therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ El fundamento let us go on to a Perfection not laying again the foundation a repentance from their works and uh the faith toward godismos of doctrine of baptisms and at the resurrection of the Dead remember if you want to be in the resurrection you want to be in the Rapture believe that what is being taught of the Resurrection believe that you will be there because there is a teaching there is a form of rain of the Resurrection then there's the lottery that is the manifestation the power of the Resurrection there's a time where the seed is being planted and there's a time where that seed is being born but it has to be the right seat it has to be the right word that Eternal Word not a perverted word the Eternal Word and remembering he says he will restore is remember Christ in his bride is they symbolize that those that tree because both have eternal life was the first that manifested that eternal life is spiritually and also physically that there will be a future Resurrection but then the time comes or that power of Resurrection is being manifested we see that also Christopher in his physical body Murio died and Resurrected the only thing that was left was the roots and their cries on Calvary was cut down but his roots were planted on Friday and on Sunday he resurrected the tree was restoredo physical foreign Jesus raised on the eighth day that Jesus resurrected on the next day that's what the Bible shows usmana in the end of the Sabbath as it began to Dawn toward the first day of the week okay Mary Magdalene in the other Mary to see the soap and you see the latter rain that's coming see the manifestation of the powers that's going to bring forth that water to the rain to the seed this is a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descended from Heaven it came and rolled back the Stone from the door and sat upon it foreign I am the resurrection in the life that he is the resurrection you will not receive the second ring yes Paul himself in First Corinthians 15. once again he's rebuking the people for not receiving the right teaching um Paul says the First Corinthians 15 12. this is now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some of among you that there is no resurrection of the dead but have there been a resurrection of the dead then Christ is not risen important see how important is to believe in the resurrection how important is to receive that former range to receive that at the reign of teaching verse 14 is if Christ be not risen says your faith is also in vain because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ whom he raised Muertos if so be that the dead rise foreign then they also which are falling asleep and Christ Our perished in this life we only hope in Christ we are of all men most Miserables but now is Christ rose from the dead premises and become the first fruits of them that slept so first Christ and then the rest come Christopher primero so Christ was the first that manifested eternal life Christopher primero Christ was the first that man that manifested the buffering then you come then you manifests you can also manifest the Resurrection being a tree of life for Since By Man Came Death and by man also the resurrection of the Dead for as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall Allah be made alive but every man in his own order Cristo Las primitias Christ the first fruit afterwards that is coming so the first one that manifests eternal life is Christ himself the author of eternal life but since you were in Christ they're in the beginning you have that same eternal life but Christ's the first one that manifests then you manifested you also do 23. let's see that Christ is the first fruit and how Christ had to resurrect on the eighth day this was after the day of Sabbath foreign you good okay levitico International Leviticus 3 9 23 23 9. you say yeah and the Lord's pick on tomorrow saying speak on the children of Israel and say unto them when you become when he become into the land which I gave unto you and shall reap the Harvester of then you shall bring the chief of the first first fruits of your Harvest onto the priest so they're in that verse you can see there's a former and a lot of rain where there's where a rain where the seed is being sown and that where it's being picked up what was planted la and he shall weigh the Sheep before the Lord to be accepted for you on them on tomorrow after the Sabbath the priest shall weave it wave it so Jesus Christ like it says in the Bible that he resurrected after the day of Sabbath the first fruits or the fruits that were gathered there in the Gathering of the fruits those are the first ones that came into maturity and they grab the first fruit and they will wave them presenting the fruits showing or presenting that these are the first fruits that came into maturity I remember it was Christ that came into eternal life foreign and a physical maturity Christ when he resurrected he was young primero Christ is the first Kimani Fiesta that manifests the Eternal youth element teaches us that a human being reaches its highest peak that'll always stay in a mature state let us take a fruit naturally in fact yesterday seven days to be able to eat them when they're young gradually death begins to enter that body there's a time or that banana where it's immature is maturity but if it passes that maturity the death will enter that banana it will start getting black just like the human body that's why Christ is the first fruits of the Resurrection your body being the seed that's being sown the body of Christ on the future always be young thank you foreign and you shall count on to you the tomorrow after the Sabbath another word from the eighth day this is from the day they brought the sheep of the wave offering seventh Sabbath shall be complete mode even on to tomorrow after the seventh Sabbath shall you remember 50 days and you shall offer a new me offering unto the Lord seven days will go by on the Eighth Day Christopher macido Christ was being waived the first fruit that got to maturity 50 days after that day you uh showed a new grain a new seed 50 days later that was a day of Pentecost when on the 50th day those are seven sabbaths seven by seven plus seven or forty nine seven times seven times seven is 49. and you add one more day to the number seven that was manifested with the first foreign and sins now Christ completed that feast he was the first that manifested that eternal life in its maturity then we'll come after more after him when he resurrected it was the first one but then after him the Saints of Old Testament the original life Eterna that eternal life fruit foreign is 23. I siete fiestas there's a Feasts you can read it at your house they covered a lapse of seven months foreign [Music] that came down in Pentecost you see the Sheep turns into a loaf of bread I am the bread of life remember look in the Bible you see seven months of after that I'll count off seven months February March April Mayo June Julio in July it'll be July seven months the full seven Church ages some Minister might pick that up and then you have it so my brother ran against the cow is that will give you the revelation of what he taught so then he teaches that is from January on to July what month are we in is we are on we are in the seventh month we're about to enter the age we're about to enter eternity and going into eternity is going back to the beginning again showing for the first the original fruit that was there back then how many you believe brother Branham but for some reason I don't know why he started from January to July okay if you accept that let's go to the Bible of the seventh month it's called The Feast of the Tabernacles let's go to the Bible Leviticus 23 33 here comes the eight I see what the Bible says saying in the 15th day of the seventh month shall be the Feast of the Tabernacles for seven days unto the Lord is just happened to say is Julio it's July now this Feast started on the seventh day of the seventh month let's keep reading this is the the 15 days the seventh month shall be the future of the Tabernacle for seven days unto the Lord so they start on the 15th day who said you had seven days yes de Julio that comes out to be the 22nd of July yesterday but we want to enter into eternity we want to enter on the eighth day I want to go back to the original Fruit 35. on the first day at Holy convocation you shall do no servile work thereinence seven days that you offer an offering main offer to the Lord on the eighth day then you have a holy convocation unto the Lord this is the Tabernacles that's limited to time but in that feast there's an anointment of the Eighth Day we are in what is on the seventh Church the future home is just read to you is the same scripture that brother uses at the base when he brings his teachings of Eternity comes it has an eighth day in it just like we've taught you are eternally I'm receiving the Same Spirit Christopher Christ physically so your body is under seven days that age there's an eighth day pores that's why you're able to live physically on this Earth it's already internally if your physical body is the first fruits I was going to come later it's already manifesting the that will come there in the future so there is a eternal spirit time on the 15th eight days later Julio it's the 23rd of July today is the 23rd of July what does God want to tell us he wants to take you Allah to Eternity once again through his soul a maturity of the holy spirit in Su Alma in his soul he thinks it's rich in need of nothing of the holy spirit is the joy of the Lord um having the joy of the Lord when you were there with him back at the beginning that's why under the Feast of the Tabernacles of the old order of the creation with your body is your body shall be eternal on
