[26:00] they
[26:02] Ino as the Bible
[26:05] says they without knowing you they love
[26:09] you and they send their greetings to
[26:12] you now
[26:15] this I'm go straight to the
[26:20] word let's open our Bibles to the book
[26:22] of First
[26:23] John chapter
[26:26] 1 uh verse
[26:30] 5 first John
[26:36] 15 the Lord says in his
[26:47] word this then is a message which we
[26:50] have heard of him and declare unto you
[26:53] that God is light and in him is no
[26:55] Darkness at
[26:56] all now let us pray our heavenly
[27:01] father in the name of the Lord Jesus
[27:04] Christ we approach your throne of
[27:07] grace I mainly
[27:09] Lord uh I'm asking for your
[27:13] help for what will be speaking or spoke
[27:16] on
[27:19] tonight I ask that you take control over
[27:23] myself and no word that is out of your
[27:25] word be spoken
[27:29] but only your
[27:30] word and Lord
[27:34] tonight a part of your bride is gathered
[27:37] here and as your word
[27:39] says you open your
[27:42] hand and give food in due season and I
[27:46] ask
[27:46] Lord that for the love of your
[27:49] name and for the love of your
[27:52] bride you speak to our
[27:55] hearts in the name of the Lord Jesus
[27:57] Christ amen
[27:59] amen you may be
[28:07] seated uh now just as a preface or a
[28:10] pre-introduction
[28:16] I know I believe that the majority of us
[28:19] know or we can
[28:22] remember that today January the
[28:26] 24th is the uh 74th uh an
[28:32] anniversary of the appearing of the
[28:34] pillar of
[28:36] fire William Bram over William branham's
[28:42] Head it was uh taken by a a
[28:47] camera in Houston in the city of
[28:54] Houston I sent some pictures to the
[28:57] brother
[28:57] if they can show them I
[29:01] have that picture has been touched a
[29:03] little but that's the picture but
[29:08] tonight uh my intention isn't really to
[29:10] speak on a
[29:15] sermon but speak on some things on the
[29:17] word and in the
[29:20] message and my talk for tonight I've
[29:23] named
[29:26] it when God decided to be photographed
[29:29] with his
[29:30] Prophet because uh there are
[29:33] things that we must not
[29:35] forget though time goes
[29:38] on even though people attack
[29:41] them for me it's still a reality that
[29:44] God does not
[29:45] change man changes his way of thinking
[29:49] his own
[29:50] perspective but God Remains the
[29:53] Same and I'll start off by
[29:56] reading
[29:58] in the uh 70th week of
[30:00] Daniel the prophet of God
[30:03] says he says he has spoken through
[30:06] me and he has spoken to
[30:08] me and he's spoken to
[30:10] others and he has told me of others and
[30:14] I know that he is God
[30:17] correct he was gracious enough that he
[30:20] came
[30:21] down and
[30:24] allowed that I could take a picture with
[30:26] him
[30:28] where the scientific World cannot deny
[30:34] it so that's where that thought came
[30:36] from God was gracious enough that he
[30:40] allowed uh to be
[30:42] photographed with the prophet of
[30:45] God and I've seen many pictures of
[30:50] ministers where there are lights that
[30:53] appear I'm not going to say anything
[30:55] against that
[30:58] but for me the only thing that is
[30:59] certain and true is that I have the
[31:03] certainty that that was
[31:05] God now in the
[31:09] Bible there are uh six
[31:13] verses where the word Pillar of Fire is
[31:16] uh
[31:20] stated I'm going to read it in Exodus
[31:22] 1321 and
[31:26] 22
[31:28] and said the L and the Lord went before
[31:30] them by day in a pillar of of a
[31:33] cloud to lead them the
[31:38] way and by night in a pillar of fire to
[31:41] give them
[31:43] light to go by day and
[31:48] night he took not
[31:53] away the pillar of cloud by
[31:56] day
[31:58] nor the pillar of Fire by night from
[31:59] before the
[32:01] people Exodus
[32:12] 14:24 and it came to pass that in the
[32:15] morning watched the Lord look unto the
[32:17] host of the Egyptians through the pillar
[32:19] of fire and of the cloud and troubled
[32:21] the host of the
[32:24] Egyptians I'm not really going to really
[32:26] explain the scriptures
[32:29] I'm just reading the references that are
[32:31] in the
[32:33] Bible in uh numbers
[32:54] 144 and they will tell it to the
[32:56] inhabitant of this land for they have
[32:58] heard that thou Lord art among this
[33:00] people that thou Lord art seen face to
[33:02] face and that thy Cloud standeth over
[33:05] them and that thou goest before them by
[33:08] day in a pillar of cloud and in a pillar
[33:10] of Fire by
[33:12] night
[33:14] now in these two
[33:18] scriptures that event that took
[33:21] place was
[33:24] recent maybe 40 years had not even
[33:26] passed
[33:27] from when the people of
[33:29] Israel were uh Witnesses of
[33:33] this but as you know as time goes
[33:37] by it's part of human
[33:39] nature to forget
[33:42] things or take away its
[33:47] importance now when you follow Israel's
[33:52] timeline and we know that at a critical
[33:55] stage in their life as a people
[33:58] they were taken
[34:00] tolon for 70 years they were in
[34:04] Babylon but to fulfill the
[34:07] prophecy God put in that King he
[34:10] inspired
[34:14] him so that he could release a zor and
[34:18] that first group of
[34:19] people to go restore the
[34:22] temple now doing
[34:25] that through the uh the priest
[34:28] Nehemiah he reminds them
[34:31] again not so much a recent
[34:36] event maybe hundreds of years had gone
[34:40] by and he says in nemiah
[34:53] 912 moreover thou letest them in in the
[34:57] day by a cloudy pillar and in the Night
[34:59] by a pillar of fire to give them light
[35:01] in the way wherein they should
[35:04] go verse 19 of this very same
[35:08] chapter
[35:25] says
[35:30] yet thou in thy manifold mercies forer
[35:33] not them in the wilderness the pillar of
[35:35] cloud departed not from them by day to
[35:38] lead them in the way neither the pillar
[35:40] of Fire by night to show them the light
[35:41] in the way wherein they should
[35:44] go now for
[35:47] Nehemiah uh in spite of this
[35:50] event had taken place hundreds of of
[35:53] years
[35:54] before he still had the remembrance
[35:58] because this is a prayer that he's doing
[36:01] and he's REM
[36:03] remembering that for him an
[36:09] event because here he's not speaking in
[36:11] present
[36:12] T he's speaking of something that
[36:14] happened in the
[36:18] past so when Moses writes it in
[36:22] Exodus uh many
[36:24] witnesses could remember and
[36:30] say yes of course during the night there
[36:32] was the pillar of cloud that would
[36:33] protect us from the
[36:35] Sun or during the day and then during
[36:38] the
[36:40] night and during the night the pillar of
[36:42] fire would uh would give us
[36:44] life now during the time of
[36:46] nemiah there was no more witnesses
[36:51] however he he highlighted
[36:54] this because for him
[36:59] in spite that he was not a witness of of
[37:01] that it was still a
[37:04] reality there was a pillar of cloud and
[37:07] there was a pillar of fire brother bham
[37:11] said that the
[37:13] scarecrows are
[37:15] are where the best are that's why
[37:22] today they began to use this to attack
[37:24] the
[37:25] message
[37:29] trying to undermine and diminish the the
[37:31] confidence in the people in this that
[37:35] for
[37:35] us is a
[37:39] reality that's why we should never
[37:42] allow that this should simply fall to
[37:44] the
[37:46] ground because it is
[37:48] part of our
[37:52] identity now in each one of these
[37:54] biblical quotations yeah it refers
[38:00] to the people of Israel in their Exodus
[38:03] out of
[38:04] Egypt and God's
[38:09] presence in the form of a cloud to
[38:11] protect them from the scorching
[38:14] sun and the Wilderness by
[38:17] day and in the form of the pillar of
[38:20] fire to give them light in the darkness
[38:23] of the
[38:25] night now that
[38:27] fire was not something else but God
[38:32] himself because John just told
[38:35] us that this is the
[38:38] message that we have
[38:40] heard from the
[38:42] beginning for God is
[38:47] light now that very same
[38:50] light with
[38:52] time did not just remain in in
[38:55] history now in the New
[38:57] Testament it became present
[39:01] again because that was the same
[39:03] light that
[39:05] encountered
[39:08] with on his way to
[39:12] Damascus acts 9 it says and as he
[39:18] journeyed he came near
[39:20] Damascus and
[39:23] suddenly there shine round about him
[39:27] a light from heaven now look the Bible
[39:32] says that it was that at noon when this
[39:36] happened that testimony that PA
[39:40] had shows up three times in the book of
[39:42] act one of those
[39:44] times that Paul is testifying he says
[39:48] that that
[39:49] light was even
[39:51] stronger than even the
[39:54] sunlight and then
[39:57] he says and he fell to the
[39:59] Earth and he heard a voice saying unto
[40:02] him this
[40:03] voice where did it come from from the
[40:07] light and the light told
[40:11] him Saul saw why persecuted me now
[40:16] Saul was not an
[40:18] ignor he
[40:20] immediately related that to the pillar
[40:23] of
[40:24] fire that had led the people of is
[40:27] that's
[40:29] why his immediate
[40:32] question Lord
[40:34] Lord now
[40:36] look he
[40:39] said and the Lord said uh sa why
[40:42] persecuted th me now brother Bram says
[40:45] that
[40:47] Paul being a a scholar of the
[40:50] scriptures not just to
[40:52] anything was he going to call
[40:55] Lord for him to call him
[40:57] Lord because he knew that it was the
[41:01] Lord and
[41:04] therefore instead of identifying himself
[41:07] and
[41:08] saying I am Jehovah he said I am
[41:12] Jesus
[41:14] Jesus was the L that came out of God
[41:19] made it
[41:20] flesh and came back once again to be the
[41:25] logus
[41:28] but the story does not end there another
[41:30] time
[41:33] Peter was uh laid in
[41:36] prison because of his
[41:39] stance in preaching the name of Jesus
[41:42] now
[41:43] brother God never forgets
[41:46] anything
[41:48] God sends his
[41:50] angel in the form of a
[41:54] light Acts
[41:56] 12 and
[41:59] behold the angel of the Lord came upon
[42:01] him and a
[42:06] light shine in the
[42:09] prison now
[42:12] look you think a light is unable to be
[42:15] touched or inang you can only see it but
[42:19] you can't touch
[42:21] it but here the Bible is telling us that
[42:24] this light
[42:27] it it smoke or it struck him
[42:31] Peter it struck him on his
[42:34] side now we can see these lights
[42:40] here and then a light has no other
[42:42] effect but just to light up the
[42:44] place but how is it that we can
[42:46] understand what the Bible is
[42:48] saying it doesn't say that it merely
[42:51] touched him but it SM him the lights
[42:57] for what reason to wake him up on his
[43:01] side and raised him up arise up
[43:08] quickly and his chains fell off from his
[43:11] hands brother Bram tells us that this
[43:15] light was the very
[43:19] light appeared to Sol of
[43:22] Tarsus
[43:24] now that very same Pillar of Fire
[43:27] that the Bible is speaking of once again
[43:30] is manifested in a
[43:34] world to
[43:36] show that it's the same God that is ever
[43:40] present je of the Old
[43:44] Testament now becomes Jesus of the New
[43:47] Testament and
[43:48] God wanting to
[43:51] show his interest in
[43:53] mankind after ages
[43:57] in centuries of not showing
[43:59] himself in the form of the P fire he
[44:02] does it again in the place where
[44:06] people would least think it would be
[44:09] that he would do
[44:10] it in a humble
[44:13] cabin in the state of
[44:15] Kentucky to vindicate the
[44:22] birth Prophet to the Gentiles William
[44:24] Mar and BR
[44:26] if they can now show the second
[44:28] picture now notice what brother Ram
[44:33] says and the message early spiritual
[44:35] experiences and he says and
[44:38] there in this little laog
[44:41] cabin on that morning April the
[44:45] 6th when the Midwife opened the
[44:48] window so that the light could come
[44:52] in to let Mom see how I looked and Dad
[44:56] D when they looked
[44:58] inside there was a light there that was
[45:02] whirling around through the
[45:06] window
[45:09] roughly around the
[45:11] size of a
[45:16] pillow and it spun around where I
[45:20] was it fell on the
[45:23] bed and several mountain people there
[45:26] they were
[45:27] crying years
[45:29] later uh
[45:32] specifically on Sunday
[45:34] June of
[45:37] 1933 before a crowd of
[45:39] people as he was
[45:41] baptizing belie Believers in the Ohio
[45:45] river that very same Pillar of Fire once
[45:48] again
[45:49] appears in the form of a star now
[45:54] look uh one of these days we were
[45:57] speaking somewhere
[45:59] else
[46:04] yesterday those pictures that you can
[46:05] see is a series about five or six
[46:08] pictures they were taken by sister
[46:11] hope brother BR first
[46:14] wife she didn't live long
[46:17] enough to
[46:19] testify of the
[46:21] voice but
[46:23] there within that crowd
[46:27] there was a teenager there with the
[46:30] name meta
[46:32] branam she was there she was close the
[46:36] edge of the river in such a
[46:39] way that when the voice
[46:42] spoke she heard
[46:46] it and you know what she
[46:49] said you know one one time what she said
[46:51] to
[46:52] Le she said brother this
[46:57] she says that
[46:59] she speaking about that
[47:02] situation she told Brother BR she said
[47:06] Billy it was your
[47:10] voice so
[47:11] then God
[47:13] allowed if there was a
[47:16] witness
[47:24] now you might say what the social press
[47:26] didn't come it's like we wanted the
[47:27] social press to come here
[47:29] tonight and they dedicate to what they
[47:32] have but God did have a
[47:36] witness so
[47:39] then as years went
[47:42] by Reverend William
[47:46] Bram eventually went into a healing uh
[47:51] Ministry that took him almost to every
[47:54] corner that's in the United
[47:56] and to several nations in the world and
[47:59] he before the
[48:02] audience many times he
[48:05] mentioned the
[48:07] presence of that Pillar of
[48:09] Fire in his life and
[48:12] Ministry maybe in the minds of the
[48:15] people that were listening to
[48:17] him there there was a
[48:20] questions if those
[48:23] stories about the light were true or
[48:29] not that's what he was
[48:31] saying but
[48:33] God
[48:36] wanted to clear all
[48:38] doubts from the
[48:40] minds of the people so then he decided
[48:46] himself to make himself
[48:48] present in the
[48:52] form among a scientific world
[48:56] for there to be scientific
[49:00] Pro of what this Prophet was saying that
[49:03] what he was saying was
[49:05] true and now here we're starting
[49:09] tonight if they can put the fourth
[49:13] picture now that
[49:18] picture it was taken on August the 4th
[49:20] of
[49:24] 1946 wasn't in the fourth but it was in
[49:26] the month of August of 1946 Aransas in
[49:29] candom
[49:32] Arkansas now notice what the prophet of
[49:35] says and the message The Works that I do
[49:38] bear witness of a bear record of
[49:41] me he says I remember that one night in
[49:43] candom
[49:44] Arkansas I was speaking like
[49:47] this and the angel of the Lord came in
[49:50] and a
[49:51] minister called
[49:54] Adams
[49:57] the man that you can see on that side
[49:59] he's
[50:00] Adams that the one that brother bam is
[50:03] speaking
[50:10] about I'm read he says and the angel of
[50:12] the Lord came
[50:13] in and a minister by the name of
[50:18] Adams his father was the minister here
[50:21] in Phoenix a long time
[50:23] ago maybe some of you knew who
[50:28] was I believe it was an individual
[50:30] called
[50:31] Adams he used to be here a long time
[50:35] ago I don't know if he was a Pentecostal
[50:37] man or what his
[50:40] son as soon as that Whirlwind came
[50:43] in and it rested where I
[50:48] was the that the image of that is behind
[50:51] there in my
[50:53] book what book is brother Ron referring
[50:57] to the book of William Brandon a man
[50:59] sent by God if you have that
[51:03] book that picture is published there and
[51:07] you can say where's the Supernatural
[51:08] part in the picture now if you
[51:12] notice the two faces of both
[51:17] men now in the in the in the backdrop
[51:19] you can see there's lights in the
[51:21] auditorium but if you
[51:23] notice there is a
[51:26] difference between brother bram's
[51:29] face and the face of Reverend
[51:32] Adams the one of Reverend
[51:35] Adam you can see the light is behind his
[51:38] head but if you
[51:42] look brother Bron's profile his
[51:46] face does not seem
[51:49] darkened that light was there around
[51:54] him
[51:59] and the prophet of God said and he ran
[52:00] towards me to grab my hand and when he
[52:04] did he simply blinded his
[52:07] eyes and his his head back fell
[52:12] back and a journalist that was there
[52:14] took the picture
[52:17] H and now the picture Houston
[52:21] Texas today we're celebrating because I
[52:24] believe that we should celebrate
[52:26] the
[52:27] 74 anniversary when that picture was
[52:30] taken the prophet says in Jehovah
[52:33] Gyra and he says and look in that Pillar
[52:35] of Fire that's in the
[52:38] picture the night that it was
[52:40] photographed it was in Houston H in the
[52:43] Sam Houston
[52:47] Coliseum we were taking we were having
[52:50] about 8,000 people in there in the Music
[52:53] Hall we were there that night
[52:56] with about
[52:58] 32,000
[53:00] now the prophet obviously in all of his
[53:04] message he always
[53:07] referred hundreds of times to that
[53:11] picture but
[53:16] tonight I don't want it to be him to
[53:18] come and speak to us about that
[53:20] picture I'll say it like this I'm going
[53:23] to invite someone else that was there
[53:27] and they knew of the
[53:28] event and his name is Gordon
[53:32] Lindsay and now of course I got this not
[53:35] from a
[53:38] book but from Brother bram's own
[53:41] sermons if now if you have the
[53:44] chance to hear the message at Thy
[53:49] word uh preached on uh uh July the 17th
[53:53] of
[53:54] 195
[53:55] starting with uh paragraph
[53:58] 36 now you can see what Gordon Lindsay
[54:01] is
[54:02] saying now this picture was taken in
[54:04] January Gordon Lindsay now Gordon
[54:07] Lindsay here he's speaking
[54:10] this practically about 6 months
[54:12] afterwards what does that mean that that
[54:16] event was fresh
[54:19] still in the mind of the
[54:22] people now notice what Gordon Lindsay
[54:24] says
[54:27] he says as the prayer line is getting
[54:31] ready he says I want to show you this
[54:35] picture that it just so happens that we
[54:37] found
[54:40] today one that brother brandham was
[54:42] speaking
[54:44] about which shows the
[54:47] light that is
[54:50] Supernatural over his
[54:54] head
[54:59] do you think Gordon Lindsay was foolish
[55:00] enough to call something Supernatural
[55:02] that wasn't he was
[55:04] there he knew the place in the
[55:08] auditorium he knew what he was talking
[55:10] about Gord Gordon Lindsay was not
[55:14] obligated to recognize that that light
[55:18] was Supernatural unless that he himself
[55:22] was fully
[55:23] convinced that it was
[55:31] Supernatural as soon as that picture was
[55:34] taken I made the uh the
[55:37] arrangements for the negative to be
[55:41] taken to the uh examiner of dubious
[55:46] pictures La houon Mr George Lacy of
[55:50] Houston Texas and I asked him I
[55:54] said
[55:58] I said you have all the ways of uh to
[56:00] use science at your
[56:08] disposition can you tell me that if
[56:10] there is any possibility that that
[56:11] picture in particular was
[56:16] forged can you tell me if there was a a
[56:19] super
[56:22] imposer if you can tell me if it was a
[56:24] double
[56:29] exposure can you tell me if the the film
[56:31] was doctored in one
[56:34] sense he says I absolutely can so then
[56:38] he took
[56:40] it it took us a substantial amount of
[56:45] money being that he was a scientist that
[56:49] was
[56:50] hired for that
[56:53] job and he examined it for many hours in
[56:57] his
[56:58] laboratory and then he
[57:01] signed with his own name in the lower
[57:04] part he stated that the
[57:08] negative was
[57:10] absolutely
[57:12] absolutely truly
[57:15] genuine I can only add
[57:22] this the picture was taken by a hostile
[57:27] photographer someone that had spoken
[57:29] against the meeting the fact is that
[57:34] he the even
[57:39] was was published in the newspaper and
[57:41] he was just as shocked as everyone
[57:43] else they were
[57:45] Jews Orthodox
[57:48] Jews and so then I consider this is
[57:53] simply a
[57:56] verification and
[57:58] Confirmation and brother Ram considers
[58:03] it not that he is Supernatural in any
[58:06] way but a
[58:08] Vindication of his ministry and a
[58:11] message to
[58:14] bring Divine Healing to the people of
[58:16] the
[58:17] world what do you
[58:22] think now let's hear something that the
[58:24] prophet of God says about the
[58:29] purifier in the message the
[58:30] unconditional Covenant that God made
[58:32] with his
[58:34] people he's in the prayer
[58:38] line and he says a person how are
[58:43] you he say I can see that you have one
[58:45] of those pictures he says well that's
[58:50] fine he says I just want to talk to you
[58:52] for a
[58:53] moment
[58:56] I suppose we're strangers one to
[58:58] another so I don't know
[59:02] you but my Lord knows you and he knows
[59:04] me and
[59:07] I let's speak about the picture just
[59:10] only for a moment if you wish very
[59:16] well you have the little story of how
[59:18] that happen here yes
[59:23] ma'am that was confirmed by George J
[59:30] Lacy he's one of the best in research
[59:33] and
[59:35] fingerprints and things like that that I
[59:37] guess are in the
[59:39] world and that pillar fire that you can
[59:43] see
[59:44] there some time
[59:47] ago there was a miracle that was
[59:49] performed it was
[59:52] this a lady placed it in a picture
[59:56] frame many of them put them in a
[59:59] frame and they put something behind
[1:00:02] it and someone asked for
[1:00:08] that and she had it on her
[1:00:12] bedside in the hospital and she was
[1:00:14] seeing not me of course
[1:00:17] not but she was seeing that Pillar of
[1:00:19] Fire that was there and she
[1:00:23] states this is her
[1:00:27] testimony the doctor gave her up to
[1:00:31] die she said that that Pillar of Fire
[1:00:34] came
[1:00:35] out of the
[1:00:40] picture and held itself above
[1:00:43] her two days
[1:00:46] later she was released from the hospital
[1:00:49] and she went to her house healed you see
[1:00:52] God
[1:00:53] only she only like
[1:00:59] a it was only her contact with that you
[1:01:02] see she
[1:01:04] only she only looked at that and
[1:01:08] believed
[1:01:09] now we
[1:01:13] know that to look at that in any other
[1:01:17] way would be as
[1:01:19] idolatry we wouldn't want to do that you
[1:01:22] see it's not the picture
[1:01:25] it's what she
[1:01:27] represents so you understand
[1:01:32] that now the prophet of God having that
[1:01:34] picture he wanted to take it to
[1:01:40] Finland and that picture was taken on
[1:01:42] August 23rd
[1:01:44] 1950 where he himself he's showing the
[1:01:50] picture now we've had two so
[1:01:53] far the next one in uh laon
[1:01:58] Switzerland there's a series of four
[1:02:01] pictures that were taken during a
[1:02:03] ministerial
[1:02:07] breakfast which was held on uh Saturday
[1:02:10] August 27th of
[1:02:16] 1955 now even the the magazine of the
[1:02:20] businessman they they published that
[1:02:23] picture
[1:02:26] because of its Supernatural
[1:02:30] content now I'm just remembering right
[1:02:32] now that I have a copy of that in
[1:02:34] Mexico but he going back to
[1:02:38] Jeffersonville the prophet takes this
[1:02:40] very
[1:02:42] occasion and he
[1:02:44] explains what is
[1:02:47] happening now that's the seven picture
[1:02:50] I'm going to quote
[1:02:51] from the message the unwelcome Christ
[1:02:54] and now notice what he
[1:02:58] says and he says and here is a picture
[1:03:00] from the ministeri of
[1:03:04] breakfast now you can see how the
[1:03:05] pictures are how the lights are up
[1:03:08] here how they look how the room
[1:03:12] looks and there's around there about six
[1:03:16] after before that and at six
[1:03:20] after now there it
[1:03:23] is this has me standing
[1:03:26] there that's The
[1:03:29] Interpreter and that is Dr
[1:03:32] goab and that's brother
[1:03:36] Bosworth all of these are H stately
[1:03:39] pastors of churches and groups of them
[1:03:42] very well
[1:03:44] now when it appeared that is noticeable
[1:03:48] you see there's no light or anything
[1:03:51] there when it
[1:03:53] appeared
[1:03:54] the eighth picture the next
[1:03:59] one the prophet begins to explain it and
[1:04:01] he says it in this uh very
[1:04:04] message he says now when I got up and
[1:04:07] said please
[1:04:09] stand the angel of the Lord is
[1:04:12] here here here it
[1:04:15] is now that's where it's going down look
[1:04:19] here am I standing here it's coming down
[1:04:25] they got the image of
[1:04:27] it going
[1:04:29] up going down from the
[1:04:31] roof as it was going down you can see
[1:04:35] everyone looking in this image here is
[1:04:39] uh looking on the side of its
[1:04:43] eye the ninth
[1:04:46] picture now notice what the prophet
[1:04:50] explains now here it's where it now came
[1:04:53] down
[1:04:55] and you can't see anything else but my
[1:04:57] shoulders
[1:05:00] there that's when the vision is going
[1:05:04] on when the it is telling
[1:05:07] him the 10
[1:05:10] picture and here is
[1:05:12] where it's leaving my
[1:05:16] face with the half of my face cut
[1:05:19] off with the
[1:05:22] vision the angel of Jehovah
[1:05:26] the the glory of Jehovah going
[1:05:29] off do you see it there and here it
[1:05:32] is after it was done in any
[1:05:38] place now when the prophet
[1:05:43] Ezekiel this is very important about
[1:05:46] what I'm going to say the prophet
[1:05:49] Ezekiel he saw God's glory in between
[1:05:52] the
[1:05:53] cherubims he
[1:05:55] described that light of
[1:05:58] fire that it was of an amber
[1:06:04] color in Ezekiel 1:4 and then verse
[1:06:09] 27 and he said and I looked and behold a
[1:06:13] whirlwind came out of the North a great
[1:06:17] cloud and a fire infolding itself and a
[1:06:22] about it
[1:06:26] and a brightness was about it and out of
[1:06:29] the
[1:06:31] midst thereof as the color of
[1:06:34] amber uh verse 27
[1:06:38] of and it says and I saw as the color of
[1:06:41] amber as the appearance of
[1:06:44] fire round about within
[1:06:47] it from the appearance of his loins even
[1:06:51] upward and from the and from the
[1:06:53] appearance of his going even down I saw
[1:06:56] as it were the appearance of
[1:06:59] fire and it had brightness round
[1:07:01] about in eel
[1:07:09] 82 it says then I beheld in low a
[1:07:11] likeness as the appearance of of
[1:07:15] fire from the appearance of his loin
[1:07:17] even
[1:07:22] downward from his loin even upward as
[1:07:25] the appearance of
[1:07:27] brightness as the color of
[1:07:30] Amber so in these
[1:07:33] scures the fire that Ezekiel sees he
[1:07:36] says it is of an Amber col now going
[1:07:39] back to the
[1:07:41] pictures the pictures that were taken up
[1:07:43] until
[1:07:44] now where that light
[1:07:47] appeared all of them were in black and
[1:07:50] white and so you could not
[1:07:52] appreciate the color of the
[1:07:55] light but brother
[1:07:58] Bram he could see the color of the
[1:08:01] light in the message God testifying of
[1:08:04] his
[1:08:05] gifts now he says here he
[1:08:08] is he's
[1:08:09] close if you can believe
[1:08:12] it the entire
[1:08:14] building is
[1:08:16] becoming in an amber light
[1:08:21] everywhere have faith in God
[1:08:24] believe him with all your
[1:08:26] heart now I'm going to uh interject
[1:08:29] something
[1:08:33] here uh when brother B speaks about the
[1:08:36] film of the of Moses and the Ten
[1:08:39] Commandments he says that was a
[1:08:41] masterpiece that the theil made but in
[1:08:43] the entire
[1:08:45] film there's something that that Drew
[1:08:47] his
[1:08:48] attention they can put the 11th
[1:08:52] picture
[1:08:54] you've seen that picture in the movie
[1:08:56] The Ten
[1:08:57] Commandments that's when God's
[1:08:59] fire it strikes The
[1:09:03] Rock and it writes The Ten
[1:09:06] Commandments and notice what the prophet
[1:09:08] of God
[1:09:09] says and the message questions and
[1:09:11] answers on the Holy
[1:09:16] Ghost M he said has any of you seen the
[1:09:20] movie of cisil De that is called the 10
[1:09:26] Commandments did you notice that when
[1:09:28] the Ten Commandments were
[1:09:30] written how did he catch it I didn't
[1:09:34] know there was two or three things that
[1:09:36] I saw
[1:09:37] there that I really
[1:09:40] liked the first
[1:09:42] one was that Emerald
[1:09:46] light because that's exactly how it se
[1:09:49] you see another
[1:09:52] thing was when the Commandment was being
[1:09:56] written and after he wrote them did you
[1:10:01] notice that coming out of that huge
[1:10:03] Pillar of
[1:10:05] Fire there was little clothing tongues
[1:10:07] that were coming out did you notice
[1:10:15] that I'm placing this base because all
[1:10:17] the
[1:10:19] pictures that were taken were in black
[1:10:21] and white but he said that the pillar
[1:10:22] fire was the an amber
[1:10:24] but once
[1:10:26] again how can we have the certain the
[1:10:28] certainty that it was
[1:10:30] that now let's go to Lakewood
[1:10:34] California in the month of October of
[1:10:36] 1958 God wanted to make
[1:10:39] sure in every
[1:10:42] way that what his Prophet was saying was
[1:10:44] the
[1:10:46] truth in October of
[1:10:50] 1958 Lort during some services that that
[1:10:53] brother Benham held in Lakeport
[1:10:56] California that Pillar of Fire
[1:10:59] appeared but now in
[1:11:03] color if they can put the 12th
[1:11:06] picture that's how it
[1:11:10] looked that's how the picture originally
[1:11:14] looked but they took a second picture
[1:11:16] the 13th picture and now this
[1:11:21] appears now remember brother B already
[1:11:23] told us that Ezekiel said that that
[1:11:27] light was uh
[1:11:29] amber the prophet of God
[1:11:31] said that the light that he saw in his
[1:11:33] meetings was of an amber
[1:11:36] color and he makes
[1:11:40] reference to that movie of The Ten
[1:11:42] Commandments the
[1:11:44] Lord wanted to make
[1:11:48] sure because sometimes people want uh
[1:11:51] scientific proof for everything but I
[1:11:53] want to say one thing
[1:11:56] to the Bible says that without faith it
[1:11:58] is impossible to please God now I I with
[1:12:03] those pictures and without those
[1:12:06] pictures I believe in William brandham
[1:12:08] statement but
[1:12:10] tonight we're presenting
[1:12:13] it so that the new generations could
[1:12:17] know that this is not a myth this is
[1:12:22] true
[1:12:25] now notice what he says about this
[1:12:28] picture uh in the message Watchman what
[1:12:31] of the
[1:12:33] night and he says and here some nights
[1:12:37] ago maybe the strangers have not seen it
[1:12:41] maybe they uh saw another I have it at
[1:12:47] home it's the profile of the Lord
[1:12:50] Jesus
[1:12:52] standing
[1:12:54] just
[1:12:56] behind where I was
[1:13:01] standing his hands stretched
[1:13:05] out and clothing
[1:13:07] tongues of fire flying out of
[1:13:12] his as I spoke on the
[1:13:16] topic speak to this
[1:13:18] mountain
[1:13:20] move and don't doubt in your heart but
[1:13:25] and we have
[1:13:28] it it's in Tech it's in the kod chrome
[1:13:32] color and now they have it at home and
[1:13:35] they're
[1:13:38] doing it's been now examined by science
[1:13:42] and so on in
[1:13:45] Laboratories it will soon come out
[1:13:47] another
[1:13:49] one what about six of them now
[1:13:54] that were in different places that have
[1:13:55] been taken in and
[1:13:59] photographed this is the most
[1:14:01] outstanding of all of
[1:14:02] them it had never been
[1:14:05] seen there is his beard his face his
[1:14:10] profile his outstretched
[1:14:13] arms and I was standing there like this
[1:14:17] where he has his
[1:14:19] arms you can't even see my part like my
[1:14:24] head and then my feet they're on the on
[1:14:26] the
[1:14:27] floor only the head and the feet it was
[1:14:30] all that was seen you see and he's
[1:14:33] standing
[1:14:35] there with his outstretched arms like
[1:14:39] that and I have my hand stretched down
[1:14:41] like this preaching
[1:14:44] saying speak to this
[1:14:47] mountain in that moment something
[1:14:50] happened and here the brother
[1:14:54] he snaps his finger and he says and
[1:14:56] that's how they photograph that and
[1:14:58] there was behind there with h full
[1:15:01] color and a great like God
[1:15:06] had as God deci said a great basket of
[1:15:08] Lies there close by and later
[1:15:13] on and it says and the great Lily basket
[1:15:16] is there in the
[1:15:18] front where I was speaking there on the
[1:15:21] platform the next one
[1:15:24] Dallas
[1:15:25] Texas in March of
[1:15:28] 1964 the 14th
[1:15:30] picture now I
[1:15:34] forgot because I just remember if you
[1:15:36] look at the
[1:15:39] picture you can see the the door is a
[1:15:42] jar and someone can say well it's the
[1:15:45] inside light that's striking him on the
[1:15:48] shoulder I have another
[1:15:52] picture
[1:15:54] Jack where brother ROM is with Gordon
[1:15:56] lizy and Jack Mo in the same position in
[1:16:00] the same
[1:16:02] place in that back door of the church
[1:16:05] and there's nothing that appears there
[1:16:08] just in this
[1:16:11] one up to the knowledge that I
[1:16:13] have brother
[1:16:16] Bram did not speak about this
[1:16:19] picture the fact that he did not speak
[1:16:21] about this picture
[1:16:24] does not mean he did not have any
[1:16:25] knowledge of
[1:16:27] it but brother
[1:16:30] peren in the book The Acts of the
[1:16:33] prophet he makes this
[1:16:36] remark he says behind the church souls
[1:16:39] harbard in Dallas Souls Harvard church
[1:16:41] in Dallas Tas
[1:16:45] Texas he says in February but it was in
[1:16:48] March March of
[1:16:52] 1964
[1:16:53] another strange uh picture of brother
[1:16:55] Ram was
[1:16:57] taken which reveals a supernatural
[1:17:03] light that that light appeared on in
[1:17:06] this picture as a strange tongue of
[1:17:09] fire upon the right shoulder of the
[1:17:13] Prophet the people that knew brother
[1:17:16] Branham are
[1:17:18] acquainted with the
[1:17:22] fact
[1:17:24] that he always had his uh right shoulder
[1:17:26] lower than his left
[1:17:28] one I don't know how many of
[1:17:31] you have seen those home films that were
[1:17:34] Tak where the Prophet is
[1:17:37] walking and I've proven it Time After
[1:17:41] Time what brother green is saying here
[1:17:43] is
[1:17:46] true and I've seen that I can prove it
[1:17:48] to
[1:17:50] anyone brother green keeps saying
[1:17:55] he says the anointing was always on his
[1:17:56] right
[1:17:58] side where the angel of the Lord would
[1:18:03] stand when brother Billy Paul showed
[1:18:05] this picture to his
[1:18:07] father brother Bram told him to keep it
[1:18:11] he
[1:18:12] said
[1:18:14] they did not believe the one in
[1:18:17] Houston neither will they believe this
[1:18:19] one for this
[1:18:21] reason hardly anyone ever saw this
[1:18:27] picture unless until after the death of
[1:18:29] brother
[1:18:32] Bram then brother Billy Paul hung up
[1:18:35] that picture in his
[1:18:39] office but did not give out copies due
[1:18:42] to the instructions that brother BR had
[1:18:43] given
[1:18:45] him that's why the prophet of
[1:18:48] God always wanted that
[1:18:51] people that were going through the
[1:18:53] prayer
[1:18:54] line would stand on his right side
[1:18:57] because he would say that the angel of
[1:19:00] the
[1:19:01] Lord would stand on his right
[1:19:04] side now we can find a reference to this
[1:19:07] in the
[1:19:08] Bible in Luke
[1:19:12] 1:1 here the Bible speaks of
[1:19:16] Zechariah and it says and there appeared
[1:19:18] unto him an angel of the Lord standing
[1:19:20] on the on the right side
[1:19:23] of the altar of
[1:19:27] incense now uh uh sunset Mountain
[1:19:33] Arizona May 19th of
[1:19:39] 1965 now the last three pictures that
[1:19:41] were taking of brother
[1:19:43] Bram where the pillar of fire
[1:19:45] appears upon a
[1:19:48] rock it also includes his son
[1:19:51] Joseph
[1:19:55] that Wednesday on the of the Year 1965
[1:19:57] in the month of
[1:19:59] May of the May 19th his son Joseph was
[1:20:03] having a
[1:20:04] birthday and brother
[1:20:07] Bram wanted to take him to Sunset
[1:20:11] Mountain where that loud noise
[1:20:16] happened on Good Friday in
[1:20:20] 1964 many pictures were taken
[1:20:23] but from all that were
[1:20:27] taken there's three that stand out this
[1:20:29] is the first picture this is Brother BR
[1:20:32] The
[1:20:33] Rock The Rock being
[1:20:36] bathed with that Amber color light the
[1:20:39] next
[1:20:43] picture if you look on the left
[1:20:47] side you can see the light on the Rock
[1:20:51] the next one
[1:20:55] here is more
[1:20:58] evident at the bottom of the picture you
[1:21:01] can
[1:21:02] see that Amber
[1:21:06] color even on the the table and The Rock
[1:21:13] there to the knowledge that I have that
[1:21:15] was in May of 196 to what I
[1:21:19] know brother bam did not speak about
[1:21:22] this picture
[1:21:24] but the one that took those
[1:21:29] pictures I have a series about seven
[1:21:31] pictures among them are these the one
[1:21:34] that took these pictures Roy Robertson
[1:21:36] was Roy
[1:21:37] Robertson now notice what he
[1:21:41] says I brought this out of the only
[1:21:43] believe
[1:21:45] magazine volume uh three number
[1:21:48] two uh the eth Edition page 16 and now
[1:21:52] notice what he
[1:21:55] says he says on May the 19th of
[1:22:00] 1965 was uh the 10th anniversary of
[1:22:03] Joseph the son of brother
[1:22:05] Bram and brother Bram took
[1:22:09] him along with several other
[1:22:12] brothers and myself to Sunset
[1:22:16] Mountain to spend the day
[1:22:19] there I had taken with me a little
[1:22:21] camera
[1:22:23] Browning uh one of the Browning uh
[1:22:26] brand but when we got
[1:22:29] there I saw that some of the other
[1:22:32] brothers had newer cameras and even
[1:22:36] better
[1:22:37] ones I let them take the
[1:22:42] pictures and brother Bron began to
[1:22:44] relate some of the things that had taken
[1:22:46] place in that
[1:22:48] place telling
[1:22:50] Joseph where the different things had
[1:22:52] taken place and as he did
[1:22:56] it the brothers were taking
[1:22:59] pictures and then brother Bram addressed
[1:23:02] me and said brother
[1:23:08] Roy would you like to take the picture
[1:23:10] of me standing on this rock
[1:23:12] here I said of course brother BR I took
[1:23:15] out my little
[1:23:16] camera and I began to take
[1:23:20] pictures I took one of him standing
[1:23:22] alone on the
[1:23:26] Rock then he asked Joseph to uh get up
[1:23:29] on the rock with
[1:23:31] him and I took one of them
[1:23:35] together in total I took an amount of 12
[1:23:39] pictures of that day and brother Bram
[1:23:41] told
[1:23:42] me as soon as you develop the film of
[1:23:45] those I want to see
[1:23:47] them many days
[1:23:51] later when when uh the people that
[1:23:54] developed the film returned the film to
[1:23:57] me I showed them to my
[1:24:00] wife and I uh very upset
[1:24:04] said there must have been something
[1:24:07] wrong with my
[1:24:10] camera because some of these pictures
[1:24:12] are complete scratched are completely
[1:24:14] scratched with the
[1:24:16] color our
[1:24:21] department
[1:24:23] or our apartment was just uh down the
[1:24:26] street where brother Bram lived and I
[1:24:28] went to his
[1:24:31] house to show him the
[1:24:34] pictures when I told him what I had in
[1:24:36] my
[1:24:38] hand he called sister
[1:24:41] Bram and began to show her the pictures
[1:24:44] and said you
[1:24:46] see here's what I told
[1:24:50] you this is the the angel of the Lord
[1:24:53] that you see on the
[1:24:54] Rock
[1:25:00] now I believe that my Exposition should
[1:25:03] end here it's already enough but now
[1:25:06] let's go to
[1:25:11] something last night I told the brothers
[1:25:13] that when a minister say I'm closing I
[1:25:15] really don't believe
[1:25:16] him but I just want to touch this uh at
[1:25:20] his grave
[1:25:21] site
[1:25:23] now the first
[1:25:25] picture
[1:25:27] of uh the first picture showing brother
[1:25:30] Ram's grave site that
[1:25:34] one now this is the grave site when they
[1:25:37] just
[1:25:39] bar uh were they barely buried brother R
[1:25:42] there's no h headstone or gravestone
[1:25:44] there it's just that's how it was back
[1:25:47] then and a little Eagle there laying now
[1:25:51] you can see there is a light of the same
[1:25:55] color in the in the form of an
[1:25:57] eye the next
[1:26:02] picture I'm going to tell you this one
[1:26:04] because this picture has a story now
[1:26:06] this
[1:26:14] story it was told by Brother
[1:26:17] Hickerson now this
[1:26:19] picture was taken
[1:26:23] after Brother bram's
[1:26:27] cast was had already dropped down to the
[1:26:30] ground was already buried in the ground
[1:26:32] Hickerson brother holl
[1:26:36] Hickerson that was a deacon at brandom
[1:26:39] tabernacle during brother bram's
[1:26:44] time he said that it was a day or
[1:26:47] several days later when that picture was
[1:26:51] taken after after the the casket was
[1:26:53] laid in that they took this
[1:26:56] picture now he
[1:26:59] remembers Robertson that the residents
[1:27:01] of
[1:27:04] brotherson rather he remembers that the
[1:27:06] relatives of brother Roy
[1:27:10] Robertson a truste of Bram tabernacle
[1:27:12] during William bram's
[1:27:16] time they saw the casket above the
[1:27:19] ground after the burial
[1:27:22] and so they made this
[1:27:27] comment he says what kind of religion
[1:27:29] leaves the casket on the ground
[1:27:33] after but the casket was already dropped
[1:27:36] into the
[1:27:37] ground now this picture
[1:27:42] shows that there was there something
[1:27:44] appearing to the human eye that the
[1:27:47] casket was already dropped down to the
[1:27:51] ground that's how brother Hickerson
[1:27:53] tells this
[1:27:57] story now he was one of the Paul Bears
[1:27:59] of the casket to that
[1:28:01] place so he fir hand he
[1:28:05] knew that the casket had already gone
[1:28:08] into the
[1:28:11] ground
[1:28:13] now those
[1:28:17] pictures now you remember the old uh
[1:28:19] pictures that were of of the rolls
[1:28:23] there wasn't Photoshop back
[1:28:26] there to edit them or um manipulate
[1:28:30] them but that's how it
[1:28:33] appears in the form of a
[1:28:36] casket the third
[1:28:40] picture now you can see this one is in
[1:28:42] black and white but you can see a circle
[1:28:45] of light that is around the picture the
[1:28:49] next
[1:28:51] one
[1:28:56] now you can see this this was a
[1:28:58] screenshot of a
[1:29:01] video in this video there's some
[1:29:03] brothers that are
[1:29:05] going I think it was during the
[1:29:08] 90s and they were with the
[1:29:11] camera recording brother bram's
[1:29:13] bra and then
[1:29:15] suddenly out of the out of the grve
[1:29:18] there com a lot van amber
[1:29:20] color as it was a dove that was uh
[1:29:24] flapping its wings
[1:29:27] there they just took the
[1:29:29] picture so that you can see that and
[1:29:32] then the last
[1:29:34] one maybe this one is not as known uh
[1:29:38] there appears that light in the form of
[1:29:42] the
[1:29:46] cloud so please stand in what better way
[1:29:50] to remember
[1:29:53] that a day like
[1:29:54] today God
[1:29:58] decided to be photographed with this
[1:30:02] Prophet there's too many evidences for
[1:30:05] this to be
[1:30:07] false no one uh tampered with
[1:30:10] this it's it's that God simply
[1:30:14] wanted to do it so that the Believers
[1:30:17] could believe it I say it
[1:30:20] again even in this pictures did not
[1:30:23] exist but if the prophet of God said I
[1:30:26] would have believed it because I'm a
[1:30:29] Believer God called me to be a
[1:30:31] believer there's things that the Bible
[1:30:33] says there's no evidence for it
[1:30:37] never we should not deny them because
[1:30:40] there's no evidence we believe
[1:30:43] them but in a scientific
[1:30:46] World God had to
[1:30:48] show through science to vindicate
[1:30:52] that this message and this
[1:30:55] messenger came sent from God let us pray
[1:31:03] father I would like to thank you this
[1:31:05] evening
[1:31:06] Lord that you allowed
[1:31:08] me speak on these things Lord
[1:31:12] Jesus I think we should never allow
[1:31:15] Lord that this is left in
[1:31:19] Oblivion that if this world
[1:31:24] were to
[1:31:25] exist for a 100 more
[1:31:28] years or 200 more
[1:31:31] years May those
[1:31:33] Generations just like
[1:31:35] Nehemiah can
[1:31:38] remember that Lord you cared
[1:31:41] enough in human Affairs that you
[1:31:44] decided to be
[1:31:46] photographed with your
[1:31:49] Prophet father I thank you tonight
[1:31:53] for this thought of your
[1:31:54] word leave it in our hearts
