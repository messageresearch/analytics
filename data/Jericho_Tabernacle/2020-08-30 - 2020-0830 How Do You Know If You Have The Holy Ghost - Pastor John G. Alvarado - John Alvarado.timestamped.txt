[1:05:06] tamina australia
[1:05:32] after righteousness
[1:05:48] likewise our
[1:06:30] now we have we have a message before us
[1:06:32] here today
[1:06:35] i think it's a very beautiful glorious
[1:06:38] message
[1:06:41] how many believe the word and the
[1:06:43] message that you have received today how
[1:06:45] many believe that
[1:06:49] how many believe that god sent us a
[1:06:50] prophet
[1:06:53] how many of you have ever heard the
[1:06:54] message of
[1:06:56] the the way of a true prophet
[1:07:10] so today we're going to try to present
[1:07:12] something
[1:07:26] you said he was man that was not nothing
[1:07:28] to look at
[1:07:32] he had a beard then he wasn't
[1:07:35] his appearance wasn't very good
[1:07:40] but he wasn't interested in their
[1:07:41] appearance
[1:07:44] and really really i'm really not really
[1:07:46] interested uh
[1:07:47] how i look
[1:07:50] i'm interested in one thing i want to
[1:07:53] present to you the message
[1:08:06] we're so worried about taking a bath
[1:08:07] every day you know
[1:08:21] no i'm talking about the soul now
[1:09:05] your soul and maybe you'll be
[1:09:08] of the foolish version
[1:09:11] but we want to be part of the bride of
[1:09:13] jesus christ
[1:09:16] we believe every word that has been said
[1:09:18] and proclaimed to us
[1:09:22] so uh without any more hesitation here
[1:09:26] and just get into what i've got to say
[1:09:32] i know that i'm not normal and maybe you
[1:09:34] think
[1:09:35] i'm crazy or whatever you might think
[1:09:36] about me jose
[1:09:38] normal
[1:09:41] but i'm me brother master just be
[1:09:45] yourself this is
[1:09:56] but i know i believe a message that god
[1:09:58] has sent us and i love that message
[1:10:16] let me explain something to you here
[1:10:18] let's explain
[1:10:20] in a minute here i'm going to dramatize
[1:10:21] something
[1:10:24] one thing is to have eternal life
[1:10:31] is to have the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:10:35] and be placed in the mystical body of
[1:10:37] the lord jesus christ
[1:10:41] it's like a person that's justified
[1:10:44] they just come out of the world they're
[1:10:47] they receive they believe the message
[1:10:50] maybe possibly only an intellectual
[1:10:53] conception
[1:10:56] but the minute the second that you
[1:10:59] confess with your mouth
[1:11:05] you believe you have eternal
[1:11:08] life how many remember
[1:11:12] the guy at the cross
[1:11:16] that was his last and only opportunity
[1:11:20] and all he did was say jesus remember me
[1:11:24] is
[1:11:35] and he says today you'll be with me in
[1:11:38] heaven
[1:11:50] it's broken up in two different things
[1:11:52] though it's it's the same thing
[1:11:57] now god is eternal
[1:12:00] god does not have a beginning or heaven
[1:12:04] but there are people that have or
[1:12:06] receive eternal life
[1:12:10] but they do not receive the gene of god
[1:12:17] but nevertheless there are they are god
[1:12:20] machine embargoes
[1:12:34] let's get into this a little bit and let
[1:12:36] me explain to you entrepreneurs
[1:12:38] explicit and i i i set it out as a the
[1:12:42] title of the message as a question
[1:12:46] and the question is how do you know
[1:12:50] if you have the holy ghost
[1:12:53] have you ever asked yourself that
[1:12:57] yeah amen i have amen you'll see how
[1:13:00] many believe this message
[1:13:02] is
[1:13:30] i always like to reference coats of
[1:13:32] brother brown so you can see
[1:13:33] hear it from him
[1:13:38] and like i've said before if you don't
[1:13:39] like my style
[1:13:41] it's not a problem
[1:14:10] you know brother man would come up to
[1:14:12] the pope and he said i don't even know
[1:14:13] what i'm going to say
[1:14:18] because he was the womb of god
[1:14:23] come to his mind and then under
[1:14:26] inspiration he wrote right there deliver
[1:14:27] the word of god to you
[1:14:31] and us we have to repeat
[1:14:35] what he said we can't have our own
[1:14:40] message
[1:14:44] so when i get up there i have to be led
[1:14:46] of god what i'm going to say
[1:14:48] of course i understand
[1:14:53] but what i say has to be in accordance
[1:15:18] then you can imagine a person having the
[1:15:20] holy ghost and
[1:15:22] and denying the part of god's word
[1:15:29] now here's a person says i have the holy
[1:15:31] ghost
[1:15:34] and then you deny one word of what he
[1:15:50] why do you deny
[1:16:05] so i believe a man ought to live a
[1:16:07] pretty good life
[1:16:12] but when we come to a time of thinking
[1:16:13] about divine healing
[1:16:18] and all this stuff
[1:16:28] some people believe that if if they
[1:16:30] don't smoke or drink or
[1:16:32] they don't do bad things abstaining from
[1:16:34] this and that or the other
[1:16:35] person
[1:16:39] they're going to merit righteousness
[1:16:43] they're going to be good you can never
[1:16:46] be good
[1:17:09] okay now jesus we find out that he had
[1:17:12] he has warned us again
[1:17:14] these last days that these kinds of
[1:17:15] people jesus
[1:17:21] yes that they would be so much
[1:17:24] like the real thing
[1:17:28] they would be they would absolutely
[1:17:29] would deceive the very elect ones
[1:17:35] what is it that's that judas
[1:17:39] the people that go so far up
[1:17:54] you know what is the evidence of having
[1:17:56] the holy ghost
[1:18:10] that's
[1:18:22] do not deny not even one word
[1:18:39] shelf forgot to
[1:18:42] reveal it to me what is he trying to say
[1:18:45] i
[1:18:45] i don't understand god every time i hear
[1:18:47] him talk i don't understand brother
[1:18:48] branham every time
[1:18:49] he is
[1:19:03] other than believing believing all the
[1:19:05] word of god
[1:19:33] and then turn back around and deny the
[1:19:35] word
[1:19:40] exactly they have a form of godliness
[1:19:48] see they have a form of godliness
[1:19:52] but deny the power of their house
[1:19:56] so it's a very deceiving age that we're
[1:19:59] living in
[1:20:02] it's got to be the word of god applied
[1:20:04] to you
[1:20:07] outstanding now i'm going to get into
[1:20:10] here what i
[1:20:11] what i want to it's so simple what i've
[1:20:13] got to say to you
[1:21:54] so i believe god has the holy ghost for
[1:21:56] us
[1:22:00] get up and receive it take it it's yours
[1:22:03] god will change you transform you and
[1:22:05] make you a new creature
[1:22:06] christ jesus
[1:22:20] now let's listen here how brother brown
[1:22:22] breaks this down
[1:22:36] your spirit okay god cannot give you the
[1:22:39] holy ghost
[1:22:41] has to give you a new spirit
[1:22:45] first primero a new spirit
[1:22:49] spirit vessel
[1:23:17] oh you made a mistake you sinned he said
[1:23:21] after you you confessed and you believe
[1:23:23] you said now you're christian
[1:23:24] you made a mistake
[1:23:29] you smoked a cigarette after you said
[1:23:32] you believed now you smoked a cigarette
[1:23:37] brother brangham explains all that
[1:23:39] explicitly
[1:23:40] he says if you say this is the pekka
[1:23:42] you're going to pay for it
[1:23:44] abraham brother
[1:24:01] she sometimes she doubts
[1:24:04] what does she doubt he can't do that she
[1:24:05] doubts who she is
[1:24:08] you gotta believe who you are you are a
[1:24:11] son of god
[1:24:13] by the grace of god
[1:24:22] let me go back to the show i can plant
[1:24:24] uh
[1:24:25] express what i want to say this morning
[1:24:32] that's the first thing god does to a
[1:24:34] person he saves them
[1:24:38] if i can insert the word there justifies
[1:24:42] him
[1:25:24] only the sins that they did in the past
[1:25:28] now in the big now in the future they're
[1:25:31] going to commit
[1:25:32] more sins so this justification
[1:25:36] of the person that's just coming out of
[1:25:37] the world
[1:26:07] justification sanctification the new
[1:26:10] birth
[1:26:11] of justification now what did i say at
[1:26:15] the beginning
[1:26:16] how do we know if we have the holy ghost
[1:26:19] deny
[1:26:20] any word that
[1:26:46] jesus christ as his personal savior
[1:26:51] and then that person is a person maybe
[1:26:54] he'll drink a bottle of wine or
[1:26:56] smoke some cigarettes
[1:27:01] if you don't obey god
[1:27:05] god can cut your life off
[1:27:08] so that person is just barely justified
[1:27:14] she's going down the street he has an
[1:27:16] accident
[1:27:29] he's a christian christian now if i can
[1:27:32] say it like this
[1:27:34] the minute you believe this message
[1:27:37] you are a christian if you
[1:27:40] believe this message there's no way that
[1:27:44] you can be lost
[1:27:47] but one thing is to have eternal life
[1:27:50] and the other is to have the holy ghost
[1:27:54] one is eternal life the other one
[1:27:58] is the holy ghost
[1:28:03] excuse me now for a second i'm going to
[1:28:05] get kind of deep here okay
[1:28:10] it's the book of redemption three things
[1:28:26] three things redeemed under the sixth
[1:28:29] heal
[1:28:32] and they're sealed not with the holy
[1:28:35] ghost
[1:28:37] they're sealed with eternal life
[1:28:40] cannot
[1:29:07] god bless you sir that's right god bless
[1:29:10] you that's right that's good
[1:29:15] uh our heavenly father
[1:29:18] i now bring each one of you the
[1:29:20] recording angel standing here
[1:29:22] taking down every name that's raised
[1:29:24] their hand tonight to receive
[1:29:26] eternal life
[1:29:36] and taking those names
[1:29:40] who are candidates
[1:29:43] for the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:29:49] you hope see how brother brian separates
[1:29:51] it there comes
[1:29:54] okay tonight to receive eternal life
[1:29:59] in those names who are candidates
[1:30:04] for the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:30:08] the word said blessed are they that
[1:30:10] hunger and thirst for righteousness for
[1:30:12] they shall be filled
[1:30:18] now let's go into the scriptures now
[1:30:21] then shall the kingdom of heaven be
[1:30:22] likened into ten virgins which took
[1:30:24] their lamps and went forth to meet the
[1:30:26] bridegroom
[1:30:32] and
[1:30:45] they that were foolish took their lambs
[1:30:47] and took no oil with them
[1:30:51] tomorrow but the wise took oil in their
[1:30:54] vessel with their lamps
[1:30:58] while the bridegroom terry they all
[1:30:59] slumbered and slipped
[1:31:13] all ten versions are saved
[1:31:17] they all have eternal life
[1:31:21] i'm gonna dramatize something here in a
[1:31:22] minute just give me a little just a few
[1:31:24] minutes be patient with me
[1:31:27] and at midnight there was a cry made
[1:31:30] yeah
[1:31:32] behold the bride can come and go out to
[1:31:34] meet meet him
[1:31:38] then all of those are all those virgins
[1:31:40] rose and trim their lamps
[1:31:56] and my wife has these candle things
[1:31:58] where there's
[1:32:00] there's a fluid on the bottom
[1:32:04] it's got a wick on top and i try to lit
[1:32:08] it i try to light it up
[1:32:10] and then i said i know i have to be cut
[1:32:12] so i cut i cut it straight and i know
[1:32:13] how it's supposed to be cut
[1:32:18] my wife showed me she said it's cut like
[1:32:20] this
[1:32:36] she has made herself ready
[1:32:52] they had oil
[1:32:58] they ran out of revelation
[1:33:01] then all those virgins arose and trimmed
[1:33:04] their lamps
[1:33:25] now watch this observe it uh have you
[1:33:28] ever met somebody that's
[1:33:30] despotic
[1:33:36] how many like a person like that i don't
[1:33:40] you know i like somebody to be you know
[1:33:42] nice and considerate
[1:33:47] i don't like rude people amen
[1:33:51] amen amen i mean okay
[1:33:55] listen the way the bride is
[1:33:59] answers the foolish version
[1:34:02] but the wife answered saying not so
[1:34:06] much
[1:34:10] there not be enough for us
[1:34:16] but go e rather to them that sell and
[1:34:18] buy of yourself
[1:34:25] one time my wife was out on the street
[1:34:30] this lady begger came up to her
[1:34:31] yesterday
[1:34:34] i might not quote the mess of the the
[1:34:36] story just like my wife
[1:34:37] you can she'll explain to you better
[1:34:43] and and with something like this she
[1:34:44] said can you give me some money or
[1:34:46] something
[1:34:50] and then my wife said well you know i
[1:34:51] don't i don't remember what she actually
[1:34:52] said well i don't have no money or
[1:34:53] something
[1:34:57] and the lady got upset
[1:35:25] and my wife she's very respectful she
[1:35:27] doesn't like to be rude no legusa
[1:35:30] but these people sometimes they beg for
[1:35:32] something
[1:35:35] they're rude and they almost want to
[1:35:38] hold you up
[1:35:40] give me money
[1:36:04] you know if you're healthy enough to
[1:36:05] stand here and talk to me you can talk
[1:36:07] on the phone or be
[1:36:09] a telephone reception something talk
[1:36:11] work
[1:36:16] but look at the answer here what the
[1:36:18] bible says that the bride told
[1:36:20] the full inversion
[1:37:03] i said to he that hears my words and
[1:37:04] believeth on him
[1:37:06] that has set me has everlasting life and
[1:37:08] shall not come into con
[1:37:09] condemnation but is passed from death
[1:37:12] and to life
[1:37:13] de sierto de sierto os digo el que oh
[1:37:15] yemi palabra ecre alchem
[1:37:33] if you hear my words believeth on him
[1:37:36] that's has sent me
[1:37:38] alchemy has everlasting life
[1:37:43] in the minute you believe al momento
[1:37:45] christa you have everlasting life you
[1:37:48] have eternal life
[1:37:50] and you cannot be lost
[1:37:53] and you will not come into condemnation
[1:37:57] in other words you won't go to the lake
[1:37:59] of fires
[1:38:14] and shall not come into condemnation
[1:38:17] or judgment the bride does not go to the
[1:38:21] great tribulation
[1:38:25] she goes in the rapture but the foolish
[1:38:28] virgin
[1:38:43] virgins because they have eternal life
[1:38:46] and they cannot be lost
[1:38:49] and the other the bride same scripture
[1:38:53] saint john 5 24.
[1:40:04] so i have a hard time sometimes i have
[1:40:05] to ask my daughter how do you say this
[1:40:07] word
[1:40:08] i'm i'm like uh tongue tied i can't say
[1:40:10] certain words
[1:40:18] i want to read you a word here forgive
[1:40:21] me because
[1:40:22] my tongue doesn't help help me to
[1:40:23] pronounce words
[1:40:27] but uh let's let's go to the definition
[1:40:30] of the word now
[1:40:32] and forgive me for not saying it right i
[1:40:34] can't i can't
[1:40:35] i can't help it brother my tongue is
[1:40:37] tongue-tied
[1:40:42] the word president
[1:40:47] okay he says it a lot better listen to
[1:40:49] it the way he says
[1:40:53] the definition of this word an early
[1:40:56] event or action that is regarded as an
[1:40:58] example or guide to be considered in the
[1:41:01] subsequent
[1:41:02] similar circumstances
[1:41:11] in circumstances now we're not talking
[1:41:14] about the word president like
[1:41:15] president trump
[1:41:31] in subsequent similar circumstances
[1:41:35] in circumstances so what brother branham
[1:41:38] says
[1:41:41] that's what we have to use as a guide is
[1:41:52] but this system will will not grow out
[1:41:54] of this cause it's a system
[1:41:58] of
[1:42:12] but they're both in the same field
[1:42:16] watered by the same water regattas
[1:42:19] and the same sun water by the word
[1:42:24] and by the holy spirit
[1:42:28] i just said that one is the word
[1:42:32] one is not the word
[1:42:36] and them two are fighting
[1:42:40] they've been fighting since the first
[1:42:42] reformation
[1:42:45] and they're still fighting
[1:42:49] now i know what brother branham said all
[1:42:50] right
[1:42:52] we're not supposed to argue it says
[1:43:14] he said abraham you say abram he didn't
[1:43:17] even know himself
[1:43:20] that he was a warrior he was a soldier
[1:43:25] and being a soldier he said he went
[1:43:27] after his nephew
[1:43:31] he went to a battle he went to fight
[1:43:34] for apeliar to come after lot
[1:43:52] look the the way of a true prophet
[1:43:56] when he comes to see and when he comes
[1:43:58] on the scene
[1:44:00] he's always against the system
[1:44:04] and he
[1:44:32] is
[1:45:06] [Applause]
[1:45:15] you say brother johnny you're fighting
[1:45:17] now this is
[1:45:18] established
[1:45:22] god sent us a prophet the way of a true
[1:45:25] prophet
[1:45:27] he comes out and with a sharp edged
[1:45:29] sword and he just attacks
[1:45:34] okay since they've been fighting since
[1:45:36] the first reformation
[1:45:39] reformacion martin luther martin luther
[1:45:42] he stood up
[1:45:57] and the other is not the word
[1:46:00] and they're still fighting brother
[1:46:03] johnny you're fighting
[1:46:04] brother johnny we shouldn't be fighting
[1:46:10] okay i'm gonna
[1:46:22] i never attack anybody for their
[1:46:24] doctrine
[1:46:36] been very watchful in hearing what i'm
[1:46:38] saying everywhere that i'm saying
[1:46:41] brother bram said this i believe that
[1:46:44] the trinitarians
[1:46:46] have eternal life what
[1:46:50] okay brother brab says decent amount of
[1:46:52] random
[1:47:14] some people believe out there they
[1:47:15] believe in three gods
[1:47:19] but they're gonna have eternal life
[1:47:27] [Music]
[1:47:37] i don't find anybody against if they
[1:47:39] believe something different than what i
[1:47:40] believe
[1:47:43] what i am against is the spirit
[1:47:47] you know you could be right in your
[1:47:48] doctrine
[1:47:53] i'd rather be i'd rather be right in my
[1:47:55] spirit and wrong than my doctrines
[1:47:59] you gotta have the right attitude in the
[1:48:00] right spirit
[1:48:43] why would he attack them
[1:48:54] [Music]
[1:48:58] if
[1:49:15] [Music]
[1:49:26] and it all started because of jealousy
[1:49:31] it began in heaven remember that
[1:49:35] remember that
[1:49:40] and the devil wanted to be co-equal with
[1:49:42] god el diablo
[1:49:45] when we come down to the garden of eden
[1:49:49] what happened in the garden of eden
[1:49:54] let me read
[1:50:08] he's ready to shoot the dark of lust and
[1:50:10] hate
[1:50:11] and envy at your heart right now
[1:50:17] you've got to have a shield of faith
[1:50:22] the shield of the power of god in your
[1:50:23] life
[1:50:26] to shoot off all those darts that come
[1:50:27] against you every day every minute

[2:06:01] to it
[2:06:04] and that's where so many people are
[2:06:06] wrong
[2:06:09] they're wrong completely wrong
[2:06:13] this message is not only for the bride
[2:06:18] brother branham said he called him on
[2:06:20] the bride the third pool
[2:06:22] for the bride for the church
[2:06:25] and for the total loss
[2:06:44] but this too is eternal
[2:06:47] wow i cut it out like a heart
[2:06:52] that's what god wants you he wants your
[2:06:54] heart
[2:06:55] look at david david david was a man
[2:06:58] after god's own heart
[2:06:59] david conformed what he was
[2:07:03] a liar a murderer an adulterer
[2:07:08] brother brahm city with god deleted
[2:08:05] because they are part of
[2:08:20] i love
[2:08:48] same material no difference
[2:08:53] oh that's sister she's full of virgins
[2:08:56] she's
[2:08:56] lower please don't judge bro
[2:09:02] if someone obtains eternal life it's by
[2:09:04] god's grace
[2:09:06] okay now here
[2:09:09] again the ones that have eternal life
[2:09:14] are millions millions and millions and
[2:09:18] millions
[2:09:20] will have eternal life
[2:09:25] and the bride ilanovia is just a little
[2:09:28] tiny little group
[2:09:38] and if you don't believe me i'm going to
[2:09:39] tell you what brother said
[2:09:44] wow this
[2:10:25] oh that's right brother oh you know
[2:10:27] whatever he said there
[2:10:28] you're right it's it's 7 000.
[2:10:33] and then brother bob said it again
[2:10:36] was corrected again we kept saying seven
[2:10:40] hundreds
[2:10:42] and the last quote i read were they
[2:10:44] correct brother branham and they said
[2:10:45] they told him
[2:10:46] brother branham it's seven thousand
[2:10:47] that's what the scripture said that they
[2:10:49] then
[2:10:49] did not bow their knee to bear bow
[2:11:06] my god
[2:11:21] and what do you have to do you say
[2:11:38] i'd be happy just to have eternal life
[2:11:43] just to know that i'm going to exist
[2:11:45] forever
[2:11:48] and if i do make it on the bride
[2:11:51] it's only grace upon grace upon grace
[2:11:54] solo is gracious
[2:11:57] no one puts himself in the bribe
[2:12:01] your name was written in the left book
[2:12:03] of life before the foundation
[2:12:05] of the world
[2:12:15] and you were already cut out of the
[2:12:18] pattern that's
[2:12:29] bear with me because it's already time
[2:12:30] for me to get down but i'm going to keep
[2:12:32] reading here well now what
[2:12:33] what's she cutting takes her pattern and
[2:12:36] lays it anywhere she desires
[2:12:44] which which way she's going to cut that
[2:13:12] and by one spirit we're all baptized
[2:13:13] into one body
[2:14:09] of that holy spirit is spiritual which
[2:14:12] is eternal life
[2:14:14] because jesus said jesus here's my word
[2:14:16] and believe it on him
[2:14:23] has eternal life
[2:14:42] amen remember what brother louise was
[2:14:45] telling us the other day
[2:14:47] now that is that is in in this here
[2:14:52] is
[2:15:05] when you accept jesus as your personal
[2:15:07] savior
[2:15:09] personality you are a christian at that
[2:15:11] time
[2:15:13] okay let's say yesterday some person was
[2:15:15] drinking and gambling
[2:15:17] and carousing and everything in a mess
[2:15:34] is christian now he's barely justified
[2:15:37] justification brother branham said
[2:15:39] listen to them
[2:15:40] you are a christian at that time the one
[2:15:43] with you
[2:15:43] accept them as your personal timer
[2:15:48] personality
[2:15:58] he's already saved he's got eternal life
[2:16:11] well you should do this johnny you
[2:16:12] should do this for them to come to the
[2:16:13] feet of jesus christ
[2:16:17] here it is so many 50-somethings i don't
[2:16:20] know how many years
[2:16:21] after brother branham has already gone
[2:16:22] off the scene
[2:16:27] look at the hour we're living in
[2:16:34] a whole bunch of people coming in
[2:16:40] brother brahms it is an individual
[2:16:41] affair
[2:16:43] worldwide one by one by one comes to the
[2:16:46] feet of jesus christ
[2:16:52] so when did you have eternal life
[2:16:55] you always had eternal life
[2:16:58] you just have to recognize it and
[2:17:00] understand that you are eternal
[2:17:04] and if you have eternal life you will
[2:17:07] come to this mexico
[2:17:11] i don't have to do anything fancy
[2:17:15] one way or another you will come to the
[2:17:17] feet of jesus christ
[2:17:21] you might have an accident okay an
[2:17:22] accident you might lose your job
[2:17:25] you might lose your wife
[2:17:31] but it's god working on you to put you
[2:17:33] in the right frame of mind of thinking
[2:17:40] to come to
[2:17:53] i believe you'd be saved
[2:17:57] god jesus christ don't people read the
[2:18:00] message

[2:25:09] you
[2:25:13] but he can shorten your days here

[2:26:44] what you saw is
[2:26:50] but lord i don't understand why did this

[2:26:58] does that mean that you're lost no it
[2:27:00] doesn't
[2:27:13] that doesn't take away from still being
[2:27:15] part of the bribe
[2:27:17] that doesn't mean they're foolish virgin
[2:27:18] either the foolish virgin also
[2:27:22] and also that's why the bride goes
