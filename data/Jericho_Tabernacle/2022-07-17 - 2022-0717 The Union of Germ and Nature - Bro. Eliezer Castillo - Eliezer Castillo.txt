amen amen amen i just thank god that each and every one of you uh brought your lick of fire so great um those specials uh los speciales tambien those who are amazing specials and i believe god was preaching us a message to those specials amen so i'm going to give you a little report on um our trip to nebraska nebraska just take a minute or two so um july 7th to july 11th [Music] julio our pastor brother octavio ordonez we fellowship with our brothers brother our pastor uh brother miguel and sister sarah faustino companies and also the church that was there that they passed her there and from thursday to saturday we fellowshipped we didn't have any services and i think a lot of times that's that's where god meets us and and build that christian bond a little more even more our uh brother miguel he also expressed his desire to meet him uh since we already had our brothers our brother marcos and our brother michael go over there and fellowship yeah marcos and that's all we did we fellowshipped and uh their hospitality was just uh amazing [Music] we were truly blessed to be there ember that because they just kept feeding us kept feeding us and and i was almost um worried because i was like oh no another plate is coming but it's just such a blessing and they're showing their gratitude and on sunday we had one service they specified that they wanted us our pastor brother octavio he gave his testimony about his life story testimony then after that i preached i preached for probably another hour and i remember uh at one point where i said okay i'm already closing so it's amazing to see people that are thirsty for the word amen and after that we had fellowship um after church with the whole church and it was just good to to fellowship with the family and with the members of that church and on the 11th we we flew back and i just want to thank each and every one of you for your prayers you know when brother branham would go out he said the large portion or the large portion of his success in his ministry was because there were saints over there in jeffersonville praying for him in jeffersonville orlando so i just want you to know that your prayers they count and they matter important so i just want to thank you for that so i just want to go straight into the message um just to give you an overview of what we just read it's saying put off that old man and every single person has that old man or i should say every single person was born with that old man before i keep saying old man brother branham said not to call your parents old man and old lady but today we're going to call this person the old man he's the corrupt deceitful person is and that's the person we were born with yes brother branham um said in the message the individ uh invisible union of the bride of christ now this is the message where i'm going to base my my sermon with today and my title today is the union of germ and nature the union of germ and nature naturalessa now brother branham says now in romans 7 aura and romano trusting that you have your bibles open if you would like to turn with me to romans 7 also he said everywhere now across the country we want to read closely now this it this message of here it seems like it's on marriage and divorce but it really isn't all right it's a prophecy of the church in the last days so he says it looks like it's a message or scripture about marriage and divorce is but he said no it is a prophecy of the bride in the last days if you would like to read from two or chapters seven two and 3. it says for the woman which has a husband is bound by the law to her to her husband so as long as he lives but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband so then while her husband lives she she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress through though she be married to another man what an amazing scripture amen now remember this is a scripture of prophecy this is a scripture of the bride today if we go all the way down to 14. this is where you see that little fight the good that i tried to do it i don't do it and and the evil that i don't want to do he said i do it he said now there there's two laws within me they say and he said all wretched man that i am wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death because first he says all wretched man that i am then he said who's going to deliver me from me but i need deliverance from myself two natures fighting against one another but on 25 he says but i thank god through jesus christ our lord giving us through jesus christ our lord jesus christ so then with my mind myself serve the law of god but within my flesh the law of sin lamented so most of the times when we read this scripture enthusiasm we see it as a fight we see it as a battle but just like um brother branham said this is so paul is typing this to a relationship he said i i need to get out of this relationship [Music] today i want to say a little story today a story of uh the story of abigail who knows the story of abigail the story of abigail and david david before i i want to start reading the scriptures i just want to set the scene so david is in a between a rock place a a rock and a hard place david uh and he showed that he had the favor of the lord the evil spirit was upon saul to to chase him and take him down a second but but david began to be on the run and he would go from place to place from cave to caves and wherever he went he would bless the bible says that he was prophesied over to be the king of israel foreign and we could see that's a very amazing type of our lord jesus christ jesus christ is so our lord jesus christ goes from place to place from heart to heart blessing each and every one of us blessing the people that he makes contact with medicine that's where david found himself if you would like to turn with me to first samuel 25 secretary clinton the bible says that samuel finally died now i'm just going to give you a little um i'm going to skip through a bunch of things but he died and in in the bible says that david arose and went down to the wilderness in verse two it says and there was a man in um whose possessions were in carmel and the man was very great and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats and he was shearing his sheep in carmel you say now the name of the man was nabal and uh and the name of his wife abigail she was a woman of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance but the man was churlish and evil in his doings and he was of the house of caleb and [Music] [Music] amen amen so this natural story it takes place in a place called carmel esta historian there's three characters there was david estaba he was the fugitive king there was nabel nabal and there was abigail abigail nable if i just want to lay it out here what is our out our worldly nature there is a rebel in each and every one of us [Music] [Music] he is the holy then you become a partaker and after the coming into his body a partaker of his divine nature this is [Music] but we don't know that abigail's in there of life that was there before the foundation of the world brother maybe they're still out in the world maybe they're still out there drinking and partying maybe they're out there committing adultery foreign is the reason we now the next step is redeem means to buy back it restores to the original owners god by his death the shed blood brought us back to his own broad it was back his own lodel he bought back the spoken word sea bride el compro de welte amen amen so how how did she marry nabel how can such a righteous person marry somebody so evil showing that they were going to work with one another and be allies and many times in those days the the parents would go and arrange she couldn't do herself something that she didn't decide for it and that's the way we are today brother branham says in the invisible union of the bride because it would stick to the world it loves everything of the world and you know what over time if you say i believe she begins to love nable yo yeah he continues to say now it was nature associated with death your world we can't condemn a sinner for being a sinner you can't condemn somebody that loves the world out there foreign when he preached the message it would cut he conducted when he preached the message you could feel it because he wasn't preaching out to the world he was preaching to those that said yes i'm a christian i'm filled with the holy ghost well if they we claim that buenos aires says i claim that see your because i'm not claiming that i'm not [Music] he had to change amen amen but to the a person that is born of the world you begin to love that nature he says your desires was by nature to love the world you're part of this you're a part of nature it is you believe that amen and that's your natural thing amen so there they begin to work with one another but the bible says that nabel means he was he was a rough person he was stubborn he he was foolish and and because of his wife the blessings were there uh and that's our life yes then there is a time in our life [Music] a la puerta de naval god begins to knock at our door not making us or forcing us to be christians i believe he had three hundred men ready to go these men would take on thousands of people just one but he went and sent 10 men and in first samuel 25 they began to say or he told his people to say this and thus say ye shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity peace be both unto thee peace be to thine house and peace be unto all that thou hast amen jesus is the god of peace amen and now that i have heard that thou has has has shearers now thy shepherds were which were with us we hurt them not neither was out any missing unto them all the while we're there in caramel caramel there he god has given him grace god you know for the the reason enables success to the naval the reason of his fortune and we watched over them we didn't do anything wrong but we watched over the sheep and your people and he had to realize that he was blessed because of david that situation when they could have went really bad there was somebody watching there was somebody watching over the sheep there was god is showing grace showing that i was there when you almost died my healing hand was there when you were sick jesus christ is there every step of the way now what did mabel say verses 10 it says and abel answered and answered david's servants and said who is david and who is the son of jesse there be many servants nowadays that break away from every man his master then i take my bread and my water and my flesh that i have killed for my shears and give it to men whom i know not where they be prepared but to be spiritually minded is life and peace for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be poor no navel said who is this guy he knew who david was there was reports across the whole land avian informes puerto de la tierra who this man who slayed the great giants this fugitive king that has been anointed he knew because he said shall i help all those that are left leave their master he knew exactly who he was i don't want nothing to do with those christian people i don't want nothing to do with that world or that religious world why our nature is against god he says how can he work with you when our nature and of the spirit is of the devil there it is he says and every man born of the earth is born in sin shaped in iniquity come to this world speaking how can we go farther with god with our carnal nature [Music] there's a germ of life in each and every that's the germ of life by nature we shun away from god we don't want nothing to do with him we're born with that nature by nature we are selfish by nature we we hate all those things now what happened whenever nabel said this the bible says that wrath is for the children of disobedience the bible says in in 1316 and david said unto his men and they were girded and every man his sword and david also girded his sword and there went up after david about 400 400 men and 200 abode by the stuff but one of the young young men told abigail nable's wife saying behold seven david sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master and he railed on them beyond but the men were very good to us and we were not hurt neither missed we anything as long as we were conserving with them when we were there in the fields and they they were a wall to us both day and night while we were with them keeping the sheep therefore know and consider what you will do for this evil is determined against our master and against all of his household for he is such a son of belial a man that cannot speak to him that a man cannot speak to him now this word is a very strange word in in english he says for he is such a man of belial this in english a man that a man cannot speak to him he says he's a man or he called him he's a belial man now that word in in the old testament you frequently used as worthless but in second corinthians 6 14. el capitan yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath um with righteousness with unrighteousness this and what concord has christ with bilal or what part has he that believeth with an infidel is what does christ have to do with the devil how could we we be how could they be yoked together equally and he said how could christ and the devil be yoked together or have fellowship [Music] he said this man is a devil el dijo hombre es diablo this man is a wicked man to where nobody can go and talk to him where grace comes that if we allow that date nature to rule we will will destroy our lives in colossians 3 5 and ten it says encore fortify therefore your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness in inordinate affection evil conspicuous and covetousness which sake the wrath of god cometh up on the children of disobedience because the disobedience because the members of our body we will become children of disobedience and the wrath of god will be upon us no wonder brother branham says ye must be born or jesus said you must be born again wrath of god is for all those things fornication and uncleanness the bible said the servants begin to uh alert abigail now there was a difference between abigail knowing that david was there and nable our aviona but when abigail recognized maybe many years the word can be preached to a person i don't want anything to do with it no thank you i don't want anything evil he was going to cause every single person in the household to die the bible says she got up and started to do something this is abigail begins to hear the word of the lord inside each and every person here begin to see that the lord of god [Music] begin to come down the road there she went to him and she fell on the ground now if you want to see perfect repentance read the story of abigail she went down on the ground i began to repent even though it was in her faults you're not the one that sinned that germ of life is not the one that sins it's your nature that causes you to sin every single day it's that old man that you don't want to do those things but yet you still do it all right because of that old man hombre oh it was him it was all him no she said it's all on me lord sorry i didn't mean to do it father when you get down to a great a real repentance oh something has to happen change the lord's course because god spoke it in the beginning there's a course of judgment coming down already it's it's a train of of 600 or 400 soldiers coming to poor wrath on every single person every single children of disobedience but she repented and she gave her repentance to him she said you are going to become king of amen amen and god forgave and david forgave them he repented in his heart knowing that they were preserved their life was preserved but we all know that in justification that old man is still there justification he was still there honestly and when she went there he was partying and drinking fiesta the bible says he was in in a party just like he was a king this is and she goes and she tells them everything that he did that she did whenever you're justified nature finds it sees the repentance of god the bible says that he heard those words his heart turned into stones his heart turned into stone and he died ten late days later god took over took over the judgment of david and he killed that man that old man that all nature she was sanctified she was free from that old nature that old man an david says i'm gonna make her my wife i'm going to make her my wife he was the new man but you have to mortify your members if you would like to stand with me you have to mortify your members we cannot be in in church and in the world at the same time because then we cause adultery entonces we're playing with god's heart or we're playing with jesus's heart heavenly father father celestial lord we just want to give you the glory and the honor lord gloria father lord we ask that you just touch each and every person here god and he said their adultery lord we ask that the every single old man father that is holding these people up may die today father um we thank you jesus for your goodness and your grace in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen yemen amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen [Music] ah [Music] you are [Music] me
