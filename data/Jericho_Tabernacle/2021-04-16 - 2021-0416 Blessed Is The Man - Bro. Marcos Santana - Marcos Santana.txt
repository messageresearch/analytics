to be here once again and i want to thank the local ministry for the opportunity to be here before you all speaking once more ministries it's always a privilege even though uh very nervous all the time but we want to let god take control this evening i decided to speak in english tonight in english because this is a youth service and so i felt as though the majority of our young people they speak english as their first language knowing some of our young people spanish is their first language but we're going to try and do our best this evening before entering in a word of prayer if you can open your bibles to psalms chapter one anthony [Music] foreign [Music] psalms one salmon verse one reads blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the sea of the scornful aventura de marlos our heads for a word of prayer lord heavenly father we come before you this evening giving you all the honor and glory that you deserve father glory lord asking that you be with us this evening may you bless this reading of your word that you bless each and every one of the young people here in attendance every single young person watching via the internet and every young person that might watch this in the future [Music] [Music] glory in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen you may be seated i never thought i'd feel a little awkward speaking in english before i grew up a little ashamed of speaking spanish but now i think i've grown a little fond of the language let us read that scripture one more time blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of the sinners nor siddith in the sea of the scornful de escarnes now this scripture here i heard brother luis vaguely mention it in one of his sermons and he tied it to how it is uh the testimony of a young person that's never stepped out into the world and and i thought i was the only one that saw this scripture in that manner it gave me peace in my heart to know that someone else thinks the same way because in english as i read it i see clearly here that it's speaking about a man or a woman they're not letting themselves be influenced by the counsel of those worldly people they're not standing in those places where the sinful congregate and the most beautiful part about it to me [Music] you [Music] if you can remain and preserve that purity about yourselves because there was a go there was a purpose and a mission that he had to carry about and brother branham's not more special than any one of you young people tonight yeah le mans and why not identify yourself with this scripture tonight and be blessed in knowing that you have kept yourself from those evil things a few days ago we uh we assisted uh at a a church here in phoenix in phoenix uh there's a there's a brother that's well known his name is brother kaidry diggs uh but a brother that god truly uses in a tremendous way for a long time his messages have been played in my home por mucho tiempo los mensages and we had the opportunity to see him so we took advantage of that we were all blessed but there's one thing that stood out to me more than anything that he said now young people might seem a little simple but just take this for yourself today brother dick said the greatest act of faith now the greatest act of faith [Music] he says the greatest act of faith is to just accept the word that's been given to you that's simple i see listen to you that's simple i see this and see you if the word and that's the greatest act of faith to simply accept the word of god so young people today if i could use that as a bit of a foundation to get you ready fundamental just keep that in your heart if there's a word that's spoken to you that is speaking to you que te then just know that the greatest act of your faith is if you can just accept it so keep that tonight because what it is do that tonight whatever it is that you're asking of god tonight young person and not just young person anybody god can grant it for you i want to read as a foundation quote from the message be certain of god in 1959 brother branham says after this stern hardcut message rude and brought out in this rough way but it's the truth brother brandon was referring to the message he just preached and he was about to enter into his closing prayers he says if you humbly believe what you've asked for um so young person write that down in your heart the greatest act of faith that i can have is just accept the word given to you and write down yes kriva that don't you never let nothing push you away from that straight rope just stand right there but branham continues until you accept it as your own personal properties do we understand that young people i don't care how much i jump and shout here no important unless you can accept it as your own personal property and i'm sure he probably shared this in his wisdom with many men but my father shared it to me when i was a young boy and i used to laugh about this and brother bernie would tell them you know i just if that's god and the way he's working on that day in particular then let god's will be done but now brother is just making a commentary i don't get it these men jumping and screaming in prolonged services he says if the word of god don't bring the center to the altar this is what do they think that all these extras are going to do and then he asked the question almost sarcastically well are we capable of doing god a favor capacity maybe raise their hand like that maybe just nod their head like this the word of god has done no effect in them but if i start shouting and shouting preaching then the word will do its job you've been then be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins it must be that way so if you're a backslider tonight i don't know who you are but you should know who you are god can take you back tonight we i know you all know the pattern of receiving the holy ghost i'm sure every minister up here has preached that over and over again so if you know it you'll agree with what i'm about to say is so i just wanted to share with you young people this evening my personal process towards the new birth me propio proceso personal para el nacimiento uh i'm not here to share my testimony i've shared that plenty of times but i i but the process of how i knew i received my new birth process i was 19 years old drunk one night i was out in some bar underage drinking and then one night the place got raided by the police because they knew some illegal activity was taking place in there [Music] i was going in and out of consciousness from being so drunk that and i told him drop me off in my dad's house but at that time i no longer lived in my parents house so it was already weird that i wanted to be there but during that car ride for those 45 minutes something clicked in my brain and i realized and i noticed at any given moment in my life at that point simple death from just getting sick nothing crazy for any reason if i died at that stage in my life i hadn't even fulfilled the first step is and i could only imagine i was sitting there holding on to him asking him i need to get baptized i need to get baptized and he told me okay son let's let's wait in the morning let's talk about it tomorrow because he didn't know is this the drunk man talking or is this actually him talking about so then in the morning that's all that was in my heart i wanted to get baptized i knew that i had to obtain my salvation somehow someway jose [Music] but after all that happiness took place inside of me yeah then satan started to torture me and torture me getting inside of my head [Music] and i remember just fighting within myself this is something i need to do and young people these are moments in your life that you'll never forget you know in your christian walk there's certain certain uh milestones that you go through the minister that spoke the day you gave your heart to the lord like sister brianna spoke the other day the minister that came to the house for a month straight and she received her new birth through his ministry the brother that baptized you when you give your heart to god moments in your life that nobody can ever take from you momentos and i'll never forget brother sir suarez baptize me in san marcos suarez in san marcos there brother jimmy garcia's church garcia just so precious to me in my heart but now the point of all this testimony that i'm sharing with the young people is that god has a traditional pattern [Music] or a perfect pattern patron perfecto like we said earlier to be repent to repent be baptized receive the holy spirit be justified to we got this country old prophet that made it so simple for us to understand that he gave us that simple analogy of a pregnancy that and then you have the physical birth of that baby those steps into three stages of my life at the age of 19 like i said i was baptized i got justified who's justificado de estabida i started accumulating a new set of sins in my life so i walked for three years in justification and at the age of 22 from 19 to 22. i met my girlfriend my wife and as you've heard her testimony she had her experience in one day come on very different than that of the traditional experience we believe with all our hearts she was justified sanctify to fill with the holy ghost in one instance justification god wanted to take me down the traditional perfect pattern he has in his scriptures i started going to church three times a week i cleaned my filthy mouth that was the bait that he chose to use to take me through that sanctification so for three months i was in a stage of sanctification from august to november in a simple he said you know the apostles it took them almost four years to get their holy ghost experience so young people there's no need to get discouraged tonight you've already been baptized you're coming here to church you're living the best that you can you might not know what stage that you're in he says the apostles in this bible it took them almost four years so i'm sorry but i'm going to say it like this then what are we complaining about the promise is already in his scriptures i didn't know it at the time i didn't know what stage i was in i didn't understand what god was doing in my personal life but now i can look in retrospect and i put the pieces of the puzzle together then he's been with you this whole time you've been presented and dedicated to the lord so there's been that angel that's been walking with you every step of the way is manifest that greatest gift of faith then just accept the word being speaking to you so once more speaking about that pattern is you don't have to pass through those same things and god's got a perfect pattern set out just for you i love how brother louis said in one of his messages he made that example about the sign you and then you see that sign five miles to phoenix you don't start praising and worshiping and getting all excited no you're not in phoenix you got five more miles to go you see that sign on the road el camino on your christian walk into camino cristiano on that long journey and it says five miles to the new birth don't stop no time i don't care young people whatever stage that you're in you're in justification i want to be that raptured bride of the lord jesus christ don't go down no dead end streets don't make no u-turns in your walk don't let satan disrupt your mind with none of those foolish things i just want to encourage you young people a little bit solamente i don't know maybe this evening you're thinking inside your mind maybe the little faith that i do i think it's been getting weak i think i'm losing that faith this walk is getting harder and harder for me i don't know what's going on with that faith that i thought i had no no don't get discouraged young people you haven't lost your faith your faith ain't weak suffer your faith has you here tonight your faith led you to repentance your faith brother kidri also shared a testimony that night el mono testimonial that stuck to me like glue okay and uh i'm sure many of you probably know that testimony from brother branham and and how brother branham was on that plane on his way to the west coast and he had to have an emergency landing in the city of memphis and brother branham says that they had to land there and he was placed in the peabody hotel foreign in the morning he said well i'm going to take advantage of my time and go mail some letters for correspondence but the holy ghost tells him to turn around that there was an elijah that was going to come across the way okay just like the shumanite woman that was waiting on her elijah elias because she needed the healing of her son and now what what stood out to me is that brother diggs he testifies that there were some brothers i'm assuming they were from that area they got the curiosity i wonder how long brother branham walked that day i don't know if any adult or any young person ever thought about that but as the story goes he left the hotel hotel and he walked over all the way to this bridge camino and he crossed that bridge and then made it to auntie's house with the with the fence in front so if i ask the young people tonight you can give any guess you want in your mind maybe ten blocks he says maybe walk for an hour he says maybe he walked for a mile two miles he says but these brothers testify that they went to the peabody hotel and then from brother diggs was expanding upon this exponent it blew me away because that's that's a long hard walk brother diggs was saying all brother branham had this and as he kept walking his plane was going to leave and it said keep walking and as the neighborhood got more rough and rough the voice said keep on walking there was no vision there was no it was just a simple voice that said keep on walking so maybe you've been baptized in january but i i dare to say any of the young people here today i don't think you had a vision that told you when you were going to get the new birth i dare to say i don't think you had a dream that told you where you were going to receive the new births but i know for sure that you young people heard the voice that you would receive that new birth because i heard that voice i've been here for all the baptisms since i moved to phoenix and i heard the voice every last one of these brothers that have baptized you young people i didn't hear a voice of man i heard the it said be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and you were baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ that voice said you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost there was no prophecy no via prophet there was no dreams but brother followed just a voice he walked on faith from that voice when you got into those waters you heard that voice so don't be discouraged because it was three years it was five years was four years but for you young person today it could be your year bro i was baptized in 19. yo me bautista you know i don't know if you can really get into the scene of what brother branham went through if i could dramatize it for you young people tonight imagine yourself somewhere at a nice fancy hotel in scottsdale and then the voice of god tells you to just start walking and you're walking all the way down to tempe in college town illogo caminando por tempe college town and you're looking at your watch saying lord what are you trying to do with me you keep on walking now you've made your way into the city of phoenix you're wondering lord what what do you want from me and then you make your way all the way to the south side and i'm just now starting to learn about the south side i hear gunshots by my house i see the police officers up and down my block and i see all the druggies and why not at the corner stores but god's telling you keep on walking now that's faith you don't have no vision nothing is vision you don't have no signs with your faith that you've got you said you can have the new birth this evening it's all in your hands if you can accept it all you've got to do is and i don't know how many of you all have received your new birthday no you've got to know that you know that you know that you've had an experience you might be brother marcos i'm a little embarrassed i haven't had an experience yet acts 19 tells us have you received the holy ghost since you believe you believed chris but have you received the holy ghost since you believed every one of you young people ask it's just but it's an example to get you connected this evening are you here tonight are you watching on the internet us that you can identify yourselves if it cuts let it cut if it burns then let it burn if it came up the expression says well if the shoe fits this expression then let's take and own up let's own up to it and take responsibility for that responsibility young people don't feel bad tonight i want you to rejoice tonight the bible said have you received the holy ghost since you believed that's me i believe but i haven't received it yet the next scripture says be baptized in the lord jesus christ that's me yes it's a young i've been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ but i still haven't received the holy ghost yet the very next scripture says that they placed their hands on them and they received the holy ghost you can [Music] how much we jump we shout yeah that's not how much we can say up here tonight the minister isn't doing god any favors tonight if you know once god told a man you know he looked over at him let me know he said hey tough guy hey uh hey big man uh hombre grande come here where was that when i laid the foundations of the earth come on man if you have understanding tell me so in other words young people to dramatize it for you with my brother emmanuel manuel now i asked him for permission emmanuel manuel mr now tell me where were you when i made the earth i ordered you tell me where were you at if you think you know now that was god speaking to job as we all know that he chose me before the foundation of the world i was in him before the foundation of the world okay i was in his thoughts i was in his veins you don't have the holy ghost this evening that's okay it's here to the holy spirit is here to give it to you you know you might be thinking or you know that we have young people here and old people here they come from a life of sin okay they come from a life that they weren't raised in a christian home that lifestyle that they have to live that was they have to deal with the scars and the memories that they went through you know he said it's so sad brother marcos these youth they don't need to step out you know if they step out they won't be able to erase those memories of sin you know once you gamble and you see how you could turn uh one dollar into a thousand dollars you will never see money the same caberas because you know what it can do you know you start taking those extra shifts at work and you start missing wednesday service friday services sunday services domingo every time you see your paycheck calaveras you'll know what it can do you know how much money you could make you take that shot of alcohol you take that little bottle of beer you can't go to the grocery store the same no more yeah you can't go to the restaurant the same no more yeah because all you're going to see around you is alcohol and liquor everywhere and you know what it does to your life you smoke a cigarette you smoke some weed you smoke some drugs in a pipe uh marijuana cigarillos you walk around on the city in the parks driving your car i can spot out as a cigar of marijuana from miles away and that smell comes instantly to my nostrils if you ever go past that simple handshake between a young brother to a sister a young sister to a brother and you experiment with satan's oldest trick in the book you will never see a man or a woman the same in your life that you've got to deal with in these memories that you can't erase it's known birth your spirit will be free so espiritu because it's no longer your spirit it's the holy spirit in you but that flesh is gonna fight every single day but we don't get a body change down here but with that holy spirit that you can get tonight you can overcome and defeat that flesh that you walk with every day just [Music] you know i used to think that the little little ones don't pay attention they're too young to understand there [Music] you know that you're an overcomer you might be feeling like you're not victorious he says young person if i could do it myself i would stand behind this pulpit and tell you i can do it all on my own but i'm a sinner i'm because the lord jesus christ did it for me that day when he died on calvary i'm tired of driving i don't know what your little problems are i don't know what your great problems are but we all have problems according to our age and our maturity with trying to please the young boy or the young girl problem so you can use me close your eyes maybe you're thinking tonight no i i can't talk to these old people in church [Music] they you might be thinking you know brother pascual uh brother tanis brother octavio what do they know your brother he can't [Music] we're gonna [Music] there's young people within this same church there's young people that have had that experience that have gone through the same things so if you won't listen to the elders of this church you [Music] your very earthly birth makes you a candidate for salvation [Music] [Music] thank you lord jesus this evening for your word you've spoken to us father open the eyes of your young people tonight may you ex show them what stage they find themselves in this and lord give them the faith that they need to know that you will give them that new birth one day [Music] and in this end time you have sent us that voice lord and maybe then it is and pray a special prayer upon every young person tonight that they
