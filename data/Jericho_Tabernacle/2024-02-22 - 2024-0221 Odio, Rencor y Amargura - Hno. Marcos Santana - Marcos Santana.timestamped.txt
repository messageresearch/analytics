[25:01] Lord bless each and every one of you
[25:02] this
[25:03] [Music]
[25:07] evening the last couple of words really
[25:09] touched my
[25:13] heart reflecting Your Love unto this
[25:18] world or one way or
[25:23] another the message for tonight that's
[25:25] what we want to
[25:26] do
[25:29] reflecting the love of God unto this
[25:34] world uh when we're on the back the
[25:36] brother
[25:38] prayed what beautiful
[25:42] words forgive us
[25:46] Lord that we may be clean before your
[25:51] presence thank you
[25:53] [Music]
[25:56] Lord with the right
[25:59] [Music]
[26:01] spirit and that's what I'm asking for
[26:04] this
[26:06] evening may the Lord bless each and
[26:08] every one of you once
[26:12] again it's a great privilege to be here
[26:14] once
[26:16] again and I give thanks to God for this
[26:21] opportunity and also for our pastor for
[26:24] this
[26:26] privilege you will have to forgive
[26:28] [Music]
[26:30] me you know that sometimes I try to calm
[26:32] down all of my
[26:34] [Music]
[26:36] nerves but it seems like I've had a bit
[26:38] of a
[26:42] vacation and many times before when I've
[26:45] had a minister
[26:47] uh and I didn't do
[26:52] it we had precious brothers that came to
[26:54] visit
[26:56] us or we had uh very special
[27:01] testimonies and it fell on my lot that
[27:04] it was my turn to
[27:09] preach and in many occasions and though
[27:12] after that um my me and myself and my
[27:14] family got
[27:15] [Music]
[27:16] sick in the days that I had to
[27:21] preach and so the vacations are now
[27:26] over
[27:29] but now we come humbly and reverent
[27:31] behind this
[27:34] Pulpit to seek the Lord's
[27:38] guidance that he may speak to us once
[27:41] [Music]
[27:46] again and just as you're standing if you
[27:48] wouldn't mind turning to the scriptures
[27:50] on 1 John
[27:53] 4:19 verse
[27:56] 19
[28:00] and the title of this
[28:01] [Music]
[28:04] message hate grudges and
[28:07] [Music]
[28:09] bitterness I'm a bit
[28:13] strong or sometimes a bit hard to
[28:19] swallow but let's see what the Lord says
[28:23] tonight and the scriptures read like
[28:26] this
[28:30] we love him because he first loved us
[28:32] amen
[28:45] amen if a man say I love God and hateth
[28:48] his brother he is a liar for that for he
[28:51] that loveth not his brother whom he ha
[28:53] seen how can he love God whom he has not
[28:56] seen amen
[29:04] and this commandment have we from him
[29:06] that he who loveth God love his brother
[29:10] also let us pray if you wouldn't mind
[29:12] bowing your
[29:14] heads Heavenly
[29:16] Father once
[29:19] again I just want to repeat those
[29:21] precious words of our
[29:24] brother forgive our sins this evening
[29:28] that we may be clean before your
[29:31] presence so that we may be able to speak
[29:34] a couple of your
[29:37] words help us to speak and also
[29:42] receive and that we may also speak that
[29:45] only which you want us to
[29:48] speak help us to understand a little bit
[29:50] more about your
[29:52] word because there's only one motive in
[29:55] our
[29:56] lives
[29:58] is to be filled with that perfect
[30:02] love because with only that is that what
[30:05] is going to allow us to be with you over
[30:08] there and we ask all of these
[30:12] things we give you all the honor and
[30:14] glory in the name of the Lord Jesus
[30:15] Christ amen
[30:17] amen you may be
[30:23] seated we thank the musicians and what a
[30:25] precious hymn that was
[30:27] [Music]
[30:31] uh I also want to add another scripture
[30:34] if you want to turn to it if not it
[30:35] should be up on the
[30:38] screen on Matthew
[30:44] 2239 and this was the answer that was
[30:47] given after they asked him what is the
[30:48] greatest
[30:53] commandment and he said You shall love
[30:55] the Lord thy God with all your might and
[30:56] the spirit and
[30:59] soul and then verse 39 he
[31:10] says and the second is like unto it Thou
[31:13] shalt love thy neighbor as
[31:16] thyself when I hear that word uh like
[31:22] unto it reminds me a little bit about
[31:26] Genesis
[31:28] that God created man both in His image
[31:31] and his likeness
[31:35] coequal so if the great commandment is
[31:37] to love
[31:40] God and something similar to
[31:43] that or equal to
[31:47] it is to love thy neighbor as
[31:51] thyself and in English it says to love
[31:53] your
[31:55] neighbor so I'm going to lean a little
[31:57] bit more on that
[31:59] word and we all everybody understands
[32:01] here what a neighbor
[32:03] is or in
[32:05] Spanish
[32:09] neighbor so there's different types of
[32:13] neighbors so your neighbor at home or
[32:16] neighbor at
[32:19] work or at school or even the brother
[32:22] that's sitting next to
[32:24] you a neighbor that's your friend
[32:28] or a neighbor that's my
[32:32] enemy so there's many different examples
[32:34] of a
[32:37] neighbor but we want to focus ourselves
[32:40] on our
[32:42] enemy that person who hates
[32:45] you the person that you
[32:47] hate oh brother don't you dare say I
[32:51] don't hate
[32:54] anybody all right so then the person
[32:56] that you kind of don't like
[32:59] [Music]
[33:00] amen but brother you're wrong cuz see I
[33:03] don't I love
[33:06] everybody well then I pray to God that
[33:08] that may be
[33:10] true because I also pray onto
[33:15] God that I may love each and every one
[33:17] of you with the love of
[33:19] God and not only
[33:22] you but even unto my own
[33:25] enemies
[33:28] well who doesn't say that we don't
[33:31] love or who claims that we
[33:35] love I could say that I love my wife and
[33:37] my
[33:39] kids that's the normal the easy
[33:42] thing I love my good
[33:47] friends or those people that are always
[33:49] nice to
[33:50] me the Good
[33:54] Neighbor the church members that are
[33:56] very
[34:00] pleasing or the preacher or the pastor
[34:02] who's also very uh
[34:06] pleasing and you don't need too much
[34:08] force to be able to love those kinds of
[34:10] people like the young
[34:13] person when he falls in love with the
[34:15] young
[34:16] lady well she's very
[34:19] beautiful and she talks so
[34:22] sweetly and she dresses so
[34:25] beautifully
[34:28] and vice versa with the young lady with
[34:30] the young
[34:31] man how is how are you not to fall in
[34:34] love with
[34:35] them and the same thing with the pastor
[34:38] and the
[34:39] Sheep a nice Meek
[34:43] sheep
[34:47] gentle who speaks cautiously and then
[34:50] very
[34:51] precise or vice
[34:54] versa a sheep that falls in love with
[34:56] the p Pastor because he's very Meek he's
[35:00] very
[35:01] gentle he speaks in a very pleasing
[35:07] way but what about those people that who
[35:09] we claim to
[35:13] love and they begin to what it says out
[35:16] in the world to show the real
[35:19] colors that little young
[35:24] lady and they say well in reality I'm
[35:26] I'm really afraid of the
[35:29] kitchen that young man that's so strong
[35:32] and and
[35:34] good-looking and he's behind closed
[35:37] doors he says I hate going to
[35:40] work so then now things begin to change
[35:42] a little
[35:46] bit so the Sheep begins to do something
[35:49] that maybe you didn't expect
[35:54] it or a minister begins to show you
[35:56] something that you weren't
[35:59] expecting or a deacon begins to behave
[36:02] in a manner that you weren't
[36:05] expecting and that certain thing that
[36:08] you were not
[36:10] expecting tends to turn out to be
[36:12] something very
[36:15] negative and then that's when we are
[36:17] going to truly find
[36:20] out if we really love that
[36:24] person as we read in the scriptures love
[36:27] thy
[36:29] neighbor if you love God love thy
[36:33] neighbor and he says here in Matthew
[36:43] 546 for if you love them which love you
[36:47] what reward have ye do not the even the
[36:50] publicans the
[36:53] same well like we said it's very easy to
[36:55] love the person who loves
[36:58] us the one that's always inviting me to
[37:00] go eat with
[37:02] them the one that always keeps invied me
[37:05] to go over to his
[37:06] house doesn't the world do that and 47
[37:18] says and if you salute your brethren
[37:21] only what do ye more than others do not
[37:23] even the publicans
[37:25] so
[37:27] and it's sad to see many
[37:30] times when the greetings between the
[37:38] brothers uh they kind of seem like
[37:40] they're a bit
[37:41] offensive the word or you could say the
[37:45] lack of
[37:46] respect I've experimented
[37:50] it and my family as well has has
[37:53] experimented it many times and I've also
[37:56] seen
[38:00] it Lord bless you my brother how you
[38:03] doing God bless you
[38:12] brother I lived it and I've seen
[38:16] it and
[38:24] 48 be ye therefore perfect even as your
[38:27] father which is in heaven is
[38:30] perfect and what is to be
[38:32] perfect god is
[38:35] perfect and who is
[38:38] God God is
[38:40] love so I'm going to read it in another
[38:44] way be ye therefore
[38:49] love even as your father which is in
[38:52] Heaven is
[38:55] love Lord bless you brother I love you
[38:58] how are you
[38:59] doing be
[39:03] love I was looking up for the definition
[39:05] of
[39:09] hate and I'm always looking up uh
[39:11] definitions because I'm very
[39:15] ignorant and somebody didn't believe me
[39:18] uh just not not too long
[39:20] ago SCH that I didn't graduate from high
[39:25] school
[39:27] and in reality I did threaten my
[39:30] teacher and I did a couple of Mischief
[39:33] things to be able to receive my
[39:35] diploma and I did not graduate and I am
[39:39] ignorant and the definition of
[39:43] hate it says like this right here
[39:45] brother I got right here
[39:53] brother a feel Intense or passionate
[39:56] dislike for
[40:00] someone an adversion or an extreme
[40:07] dislike and take a look at some of the
[40:09] words that are synonym to what hatred
[40:13] is
[40:15] intense
[40:16] passionate
[40:19] extreme and it's something deep the
[40:23] hatred and then searching up in Google
[40:27] and in the bottom I had a couple of
[40:29] words come
[40:32] up the greatest form of
[40:35] hate well I'm going to click on this
[40:37] link right
[40:38] here and then when it opened
[40:42] up the greatest form of hate
[40:45] is to uh abort abort abort
[40:52] which in Spanish I've always heard
[40:55] it
[40:58] but in Spanish when you say the word
[41:01] abore in English the the word is
[41:07] hate and it's very interesting to see
[41:10] what the the words and the meanings end
[41:11] up coming out when you go into the
[41:16] translations not only in Spanish does it
[41:18] express as
[41:22] hate but it also uses the word correctly
[41:25] uh detail the meaning of that
[41:30] word and it goes into the Very extreme
[41:32] which is the word
[41:35] abore not just the hatred that was just
[41:38] barely
[41:40] born or a mediocre hatred that it was
[41:44] kind of half and half
[41:45] no no but to
[41:49] abore intensely passionate and
[41:55] extremely and I know that I'm speaking
[41:57] to the Christians this
[42:00] evening and if they would
[42:04] ask how many of you have surrendered
[42:06] your
[42:09] rights I think everybody would raise
[42:11] their hand
[42:12] here because we have given our
[42:15] lives for the Life of
[42:19] Christ we've surrendered our rights to
[42:22] have his
[42:24] rights to have everything of Christ
[42:28] and if we are confessing
[42:29] that and we believe
[42:32] it truly from the
[42:34] heart if we lift our
[42:40] hands then we have no right to hate
[42:43] anyone if we are
[42:46] Christian if we have surrendered our
[42:51] rights I have not known that Jesus has
[42:53] hated
[42:55] anyone
[42:57] so then we have no
[42:58] right to hate
[43:04] anyone and it's a very dangerous Zone to
[43:07] be
[43:08] in that we should try to
[43:13] avoid at all cost whatever it takes to
[43:16] be away from that
[43:19] zone being in that zone means that you
[43:22] are now out of your
[43:25] position
[43:27] the minister that has now gotten out of
[43:29] his
[43:30] position and he's no longer
[43:35] ministering that Sunday school teacher
[43:37] that has now stepped away from their
[43:40] position and is no longer
[43:44] teaching and the pastor that was once
[43:47] pastoring is no longer in his position
[43:50] no no that's not
[43:54] it I don't need the holy Spirit to be
[43:56] able to
[43:59] minister I don't need the Holy Spirit to
[44:01] teach
[44:03] someone and you don't even need the Holy
[44:05] Spirit to be a
[44:08] pastor because there's so many pastors
[44:10] around the
[44:11] world without the Holy
[44:15] Ghost I need the Holy
[44:17] Ghost to be able to
[44:19] love to be able to love and to
[44:24] love and when we get away
[44:28] once we get out of our
[44:30] position of having that
[44:33] love to show that
[44:37] love right then and there we have
[44:40] removed ourselves from our position in
[44:44] Christ because it is our duty to love
[44:46] one
[44:48] another I could preach whatever I
[44:51] want and teach whatever I
[44:54] want but without love love I am out of
[44:58] position I am in a very dangerous
[45:03] position a p a pastor could
[45:06] teach he could
[45:08] correct he could uh
[45:11] pastor but without
[45:14] love he would be in a position of
[45:19] danger that's why love is the most
[45:22] important thing in a Christian's
[45:24] life and let's go up a little bit higher
[45:29] here for a message believer in this uh
[45:32] end
[45:34] time because everybody is claiming to
[45:36] have
[45:38] love but thanks be to God for a
[45:43] messenger that he came and he gave us
[45:44] the great revelation of the great
[45:48] love of that great agap love that we
[45:50] should
[45:51] have in the message
[45:54] adoption preached in
[45:57] 1960 brother Bram
[46:01] says I preach because I love him and I
[46:04] love his
[46:07] people and that's the reason I know I
[46:09] have passed from Death unto
[46:15] life because that I love them and I go
[46:17] after
[46:20] them no matter what kind of condition
[46:23] they're
[46:24] in
[46:27] no matter what kind of condition they're
[46:30] in
[46:33] Fallen
[46:35] Sinners uh
[46:37] self-centered
[46:40] murmurers I go after
[46:44] them no matter what kind of condition
[46:46] they're
[46:48] in I go after them
[46:54] anyhow go get them any
[46:57] anyhow and brother brand continues to
[47:00] say that's what we
[47:03] do go out and get
[47:06] them catch them
[47:08] anyhow no
[47:10] matter no matter what they've
[47:12] done no matter what condition they're
[47:15] in and brother B says
[47:18] reach
[47:21] grab hold on with all your
[47:24] might
[47:26] and this reminds me of
[47:27] Jacob when he was wrestling with the
[47:30] angel and he wanted his
[47:33] Blessing and when he grabbed on to him
[47:35] he said I will not let you
[47:38] go can you imagine a brother with so
[47:40] much love coming out
[47:42] of that when he goes and he rescues a
[47:45] brother I'm not going to let you
[47:48] go until the love that I'm showing
[47:52] you until the compassion love and grace
[47:55] that I'm showing you
[47:56] you may be able to reestablish you
[48:00] restore
[48:03] you and bring you back to the feet of
[48:05] Jesus Christ and brother brandham
[48:08] says you don't know who they
[48:11] are save
[48:13] them only save
[48:16] them that's because of
[48:19] love not that because I have
[48:22] to but because I
[48:24] love and the most beautiful thing
[48:28] is brother Brandon uh turns to the
[48:32] congregation because you
[48:37] lovec and then we find out that it's not
[48:39] only the duty of the
[48:42] minister but also the
[48:46] congregation it's both love from here to
[48:49] there and from there to over
[48:52] here because we are all responsible for
[48:55] that love that he showed
[48:56] [Music]
[48:57] us I think that each and every one of us
[48:59] here in our one point in our
[49:03] lives I'm not going to DARE I'm going to
[49:05] say that at least me in my
[49:07] life someone has come and pushed my
[49:11] buttons and they've pushed me up to my
[49:13] limit even up to the
[49:18] border that I'm almost about to
[49:21] say maybe you might be able to identify
[49:23] yourself with this
[49:26] even sometimes we say or we've said
[49:31] before Oh How I hate him oh how I hate
[49:38] her whoever it might be husband wife
[49:41] friend or
[49:44] relative oh I can't stand this person I
[49:47] just hate
[49:50] him no matter what kind of dangerous
[49:53] condition they might find themselves in
[49:55] that brother or
[49:57] sister and maybe I'm speaking about
[50:01] you acting a certain
[50:04] way or uh thinking a certain way about
[50:10] you we have no right to be able to hate
[50:13] that brother or
[50:15] sister we should turn our Focus
[50:18] around and put it in front of
[50:22] us like as to say to close the windows
[50:26] and uh put a mirror
[50:29] up so that when you want to go look at
[50:31] that person you look at yourself
[50:35] first return that
[50:40] Focus because then now you or a certain
[50:43] person is now in a very dangerous
[50:45] condition because now me
[50:49] myself I'm about to do a service with my
[50:52] lips to say that I hate them
[50:56] and then he keeps pushing
[50:59] me and if I'm not
[51:02] careful I'm going to say it from the
[51:06] heart when it has then now come into the
[51:09] most deepest part of my
[51:12] heart and then you begin to express
[51:15] hatred towards your
[51:17] brother and it is a very dangerous
[51:22] Zone and it's as far as our our own
[51:27] enemies and even unto
[51:32] ourselves how can hatred exist in a
[51:38] Christian if the present pardon of God
[51:41] exists if the grace of God
[51:45] exists if the love of God exists in this
[51:49] moment love and
[51:54] forgiveness
[51:56] should destroy any kind of root of
[51:59] bitterness any uh root of
[52:04] bitterness and whatever spot of hatred
[52:07] we might
[52:10] have see the story of uh go and
[52:16] Hosea how many times didn't go uh
[52:19] deceive
[52:21] uh
[52:23] Hosea and even he took her
[52:27] back he never had any hatred or grudge
[52:30] against
[52:32] her and Joseph when he was sold uh into
[52:37] slavery by his brothers he even loved
[52:39] them in in
[52:42] jail which would be something extremely
[52:45] difficult for somebody to
[52:50] do even Jesus being uh uh deceived or or
[52:54] betrayed by one of his
[52:57] being crucified by his own
[53:01] people he even said forgive them
[53:03] Father for they know not what they
[53:06] do that is
[53:11] love a love divine a love that passes
[53:13] all
[53:17] understanding an attribute of love that
[53:19] is called
[53:22] forgiveness that not only does it
[53:24] destroy the root of
[53:28] bitterness but when that seed is planted
[53:30] within this
[53:31] Earth a bitterness or
[53:34] hatred the
[53:38] Forgiveness can destroy that seed before
[53:40] it even grows any
[53:43] Roots before it comes out to be a huge
[53:45] tree trunk and becomes a
[53:48] tree that forgiveness can destroy that
[53:53] hate and
[53:56] in an occasion a
[53:59] minister can he develop a
[54:05] grudge can a deacon develop a
[54:11] grudge can a pastor develop a
[54:15] grudge can
[54:18] he Samson
[54:20] fell David
[54:24] Fell
[54:26] and then it comes into my memory that uh
[54:28] saying that my father used to tell me as
[54:29] a
[54:31] kid bigger Towers have fallen
[54:35] down so then if they
[54:41] fell and if they could develop a grudge
[54:44] or
[54:45] hate I am no exception to
[54:48] it we are no exception to
[54:52] that what about brother brandham
[54:55] don't you dare speak about my
[54:58] Prophet because brother Brandon was
[55:01] perfect that was Christ with
[55:04] us well however you like
[55:07] it what about brother
[55:10] brandham was he free from
[55:12] temptation of the
[55:14] trials of
[55:18] hatred of
[55:21] grudges what did happen to brother
[55:24] brandham
[55:27] that he had something against these
[55:28] Ricky and
[55:31] retas and I was telling the brother
[55:35] behind that every time that he would
[55:37] mention those
[55:40] names he would even say it before I
[55:43] could even finish it
[55:47] saying oh yeah he was very passionate
[55:49] about what he would say when he would
[55:51] speak about
[55:52] them now I'm not going to say
[55:56] and I don't believe
[55:58] either that he had a hatred towards
[56:04] them and I'm not going to say or think
[56:06] that he had a grudge against those Ras
[56:09] but he had
[56:10] something I'm going to say
[56:15] something I'm going to say that he there
[56:18] is something there that he
[56:20] had against
[56:23] them well how can you dare to say that
[56:27] brother brother Bram was never like that
[56:29] he was nothing but
[56:31] love no brother brandham was also a
[56:33] human
[56:38] being as I said you can hear in the in
[56:40] the tape he would Express himself when
[56:42] he would mention the Ries and
[56:45] Ras and just listen what he says here in
[56:47] standing in the
[56:53] Gap and and these Ricky and retas that I
[56:56] have so sass the
[56:58] word Rick that I've called them Ricky
[57:02] and
[57:06] Retta God give me to understand I
[57:09] shouldn't do
[57:12] that that I shouldn't call them by those
[57:16] names that I shouldn't disrespect
[57:19] them I shouldn't do
[57:23] that
[57:26] because that's many of them are still
[57:27] his
[57:30] children the Ricky and retas of the
[57:34] congregation they are still his
[57:41] children they can't help because they
[57:43] act so much
[57:50] different some of these old cold formal
[57:53] churches has got them that that Spirit
[57:55] upon
[57:59] them and they're much uh in much in
[58:03] prison as Israel was in
[58:06] prison and brother brandham continues to
[58:21] say and I wanted to bring this to you so
[58:24] that you would see and see how you that
[58:27] the mistake that a man can make yet
[58:28] being
[58:30] oh I'm going to repeat
[58:33] it and I wanted to bring
[58:36] this so that you could
[58:39] see and show
[58:45] you that the mistake that a man can make
[58:48] yet being
[58:50] sincere brother BR speaking about
[58:53] himself and even talking about
[58:58] Moses Moses lost the feeling of his
[59:01] people because they wouldn't listen to
[59:06] him can you imagine losing that love or
[59:08] that sincere for that for the
[59:12] people something so simple because they
[59:14] wouldn't listen to him brother
[59:20] brandham brother Bram here also lost
[59:22] that love for those Ricks and retas
[59:25] that God had to come down and correct
[59:27] him and
[59:35] continuing and I don't have the feeling
[59:37] for the people that I should
[59:39] have he's speaking about
[59:45] himself I don't have the feeling for the
[59:47] people that I should
[59:50] have until I can get that
[59:53] feeling
[59:57] there is no need in me going because I'd
[59:59] be a
[1:00:01] hypocrite do you begin to see how
[1:00:03] important the Love Is The Love for the
[1:00:07] people love for the
[1:00:09] brothers love for one
[1:00:16] another and all these years I've tried
[1:00:18] to serve him with a true
[1:00:22] heart and I won't go out there being a
[1:00:25] hypocrite I got to feel
[1:00:29] that that it isn't Ricky and
[1:00:33] Retta and they're not a bunch of
[1:00:36] liars they're not
[1:00:39] murmurers they're not
[1:00:42] backslid they're not
[1:00:45] womanizers they're not Ricky and
[1:00:47] Ras they're not this
[1:00:51] group and it isn't this Bunch it's God's
[1:00:55] children that's in
[1:00:58] bondage that I must go
[1:01:01] to and here brother BR
[1:01:04] says he realized that he needed to be
[1:01:08] corrected he needed to be
[1:01:12] rebuked because God allowed allowed him
[1:01:15] to
[1:01:18] see that which he was saying and
[1:01:21] expressing wasn't correct
[1:01:26] there was something that was displeasing
[1:01:29] him but he was a special
[1:01:34] vessel that in the same manner that God
[1:01:36] protected him when he was just a little
[1:01:39] kid so that he wouldn't contaminate his
[1:01:43] body because he had a purpose in his
[1:01:46] life God also protected
[1:01:50] him for him to not develop a a root of
[1:01:53] bitterness
[1:01:55] to not develop a a
[1:01:58] hate because it's very
[1:02:00] probable uh
[1:02:02] disagreement brother
[1:02:04] brandham with
[1:02:06] time that it might develop into a br of
[1:02:09] bitterness and then with more
[1:02:13] time that root of bitterness becomes
[1:02:15] into a
[1:02:17] hate but God had a purpose for that
[1:02:21] man he had to cut him
[1:02:23] there protect him at that
[1:02:26] moment so that he wouldn't come to that
[1:02:29] point of
[1:02:30] having that he wouldn't have that St on
[1:02:32] his
[1:02:34] testimony because it was a purpose for
[1:02:36] his uh Ministry and his and his
[1:02:41] life just how how I think that there's a
[1:02:44] purpose for your ministry and a purpose
[1:02:45] in your
[1:02:47] life God wants to restore
[1:02:49] you God wants to reestablish you God
[1:02:53] wants to console you
[1:02:57] and perhaps that cons
[1:03:01] consolidation might come through a hug
[1:03:02] of a
[1:03:03] brother a hug of a
[1:03:07] sister uh maybe throughout
[1:03:11] everything he Jesus even called Judas
[1:03:14] his
[1:03:16] friend Smith even George
[1:03:19] Smith when he came to preach to
[1:03:23] us that use a specific expression the
[1:03:27] prophetic
[1:03:29] Dimension and I've heard of Brothers
[1:03:31] with that uh
[1:03:35] gift that they express it as if they
[1:03:37] were on a
[1:03:39] computer and you open up one window and
[1:03:42] another
[1:03:45] window and then all of a sudden you got
[1:03:47] six windows open in a single
[1:03:49] screen so even brother
[1:03:52] brandham maybe seeing you
[1:03:55] sister with a maybe a window open and
[1:03:59] then another window open and then
[1:04:01] another
[1:04:03] one just like brother George Smith said
[1:04:06] that he was in a prophetic
[1:04:08] Dimension he was seeing who was
[1:04:10] murmuring about
[1:04:13] him those who were deceiving
[1:04:16] him who those that were lying about
[1:04:19] him but even then he still loved them
[1:04:23] that's the tremendous
[1:04:27] part that maybe you wouldn't even
[1:04:34] notice no the testimony was that nobody
[1:04:39] knew who was the enemy or his
[1:04:44] friend just like Jesus knowing the life
[1:04:47] of
[1:04:49] Jesus and brother brandom knowing the
[1:04:51] life of one
[1:04:53] another
[1:04:54] even then he showed them
[1:04:58] love and that's the love and that's the
[1:05:00] tremendous thing that I
[1:05:03] want and only the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:05:05] is going to have that type of
[1:05:07] love and if you lost it on the first
[1:05:10] age if they lost their first
[1:05:13] love well in this one we will not
[1:05:16] lose because in this age we needed to be
[1:05:19] able to go in that
[1:05:21] Rapture it was needed in the first age
[1:05:24] it's needed at the
[1:05:25] end and that love is the one that I
[1:05:29] want nobody with the root of
[1:05:32] bitterness will ever make it into
[1:05:34] heaven nobody with a
[1:05:38] malice with a
[1:05:41] hate it's
[1:05:43] impossible and Matthew 544
[1:05:46] says but I say unto
[1:05:50] you love your
[1:05:53] enemies
[1:05:54] right there everything
[1:05:57] ends I can't have
[1:05:59] hatred not to a neighbor but my
[1:06:04] enemy love your
[1:06:07] enemies bless them that curse
[1:06:11] you do good to them that hate
[1:06:16] you and there goes that word again
[1:06:19] hate those that really hate
[1:06:23] you
[1:06:27] and pray for them which despitefully use
[1:06:31] you pray for them which despitefully use
[1:06:34] you persecute
[1:06:37] you and I think that's one of the
[1:06:39] hardest things in my Christian
[1:06:43] walk to pray for those that really don't
[1:06:46] like me or I don't they don't like
[1:06:50] me to pray for those that I that don't
[1:06:53] like like
[1:06:56] me to pray for those that might be my
[1:07:00] enemies and show them that love of
[1:07:05] Christ this scripture is only for the
[1:07:08] Sheep only for the
[1:07:10] ministers for the
[1:07:13] pastors no this scripture is applied to
[1:07:16] every single one of
[1:07:18] us it's for each and every one of us and
[1:07:21] I believe and I'm going to say it
[1:07:25] that it begins from the
[1:07:27] pulpit and it goes from Pew to
[1:07:31] Pew to be able to have that kind of
[1:07:37] love and it goes from Pew to Pew to all
[1:07:39] the way to the uh parking lot
[1:07:43] outside to show that type of
[1:07:45] love to do good to those that hate
[1:07:48] us to pray for those that despitefully
[1:07:51] use
[1:07:52] us begins from the head to the
[1:07:57] toe it begins from the pastor all the
[1:08:00] way to the most insignificant
[1:08:02] sheep and just like the
[1:08:07] pillars and just like this the faces
[1:08:09] that come out on the
[1:08:13] screen and just like those figures that
[1:08:15] the ministry is always looking
[1:08:19] at the ministry that the church is
[1:08:21] always looking
[1:08:22] at
[1:08:25] they should be the first ones to preach
[1:08:30] that and not preach it from this
[1:08:32] beautiful
[1:08:34] Pulpit not preach it from these
[1:08:36] beautiful or from
[1:08:40] lips but that Ministry should be
[1:08:42] preached with that
[1:08:44] life to be an example from the top to
[1:08:46] the
[1:08:49] bottom because we're all equal in the
[1:08:51] eyes of
[1:08:52] God God makes no exception for your
[1:08:57] title he loves us the same
[1:09:03] way and he has the same requirements for
[1:09:05] every single one of
[1:09:07] us love your
[1:09:10] enemies and brother Johnny
[1:09:13] said and I'm GNA try to close up
[1:09:18] here that this message has a variety of
[1:09:21] plate or dishes that we can
[1:09:27] eat but perhaps this one might be one
[1:09:30] that you don't want to
[1:09:34] eat and I hear it in my ears and they it
[1:09:37] said that maybe
[1:09:42] today this message might be something
[1:09:44] that you don't want to
[1:09:46] swallow and I remember from my
[1:09:50] childhood fighting with my f with my
[1:09:53] parents cuz I didn't didn't want to eat
[1:09:54] my
[1:09:56] vegetables and then I hear a loud voice
[1:09:58] from my father
[1:10:00] saying eat
[1:10:03] it and there it goes a slap on my back
[1:10:05] and
[1:10:06] my then I began to eat it very quickly
[1:10:11] why because it's very health healthy for
[1:10:15] for my
[1:10:16] growth it's it's good for my
[1:10:20] well-being these
[1:10:22] messages
[1:10:24] that then we don't want to
[1:10:27] eat it's for our spiritual
[1:10:31] growth I have to love the one that has
[1:10:34] that's speaking evil of
[1:10:37] me I have to love that two faes
[1:10:41] brother yes you do have to love
[1:10:46] them brother B said yes you do because
[1:10:49] they are children of
[1:10:50] God could be your love could Your
[1:10:55] Grace the Forgiveness that you give
[1:10:58] them perhaps that might be the thing
[1:11:00] that brings them back and brings them
[1:11:03] and puts them back in into their
[1:11:07] position and then they begin to have
[1:11:09] that first love
[1:11:13] again and we're going to be closing now
[1:11:15] if the musicians could come
[1:11:19] up and that might heal your brother or
[1:11:22] sister
[1:11:27] that might be the thing that opens the
[1:11:29] eyes of your brother or
[1:11:31] sister that's not the Santana
[1:11:35] Doctrine those are not the rules of
[1:11:39] Jericho that is message and
[1:11:43] Bible that is the word of
[1:11:48] God and in the message Africa uh trip
[1:11:52] report if you wouldn't mind
[1:11:56] standing preached in
[1:11:59] 1953 brother brandham
[1:12:01] says and I love
[1:12:04] people and I love to minister to
[1:12:09] them and I love them because they love
[1:12:13] Christ and if they love
[1:12:17] Christ then they B then they bound to
[1:12:20] love
[1:12:21] me you can't love
[1:12:25] love you can't love Christ and hate
[1:12:30] me and it's not only just for me this is
[1:12:34] also for
[1:12:39] you let's repeat that once again you
[1:12:41] can't love Christ and hate
[1:12:45] me I can't love Christ and hate
[1:12:50] you you've got to love me too
[1:12:55] because I his
[1:12:57] servant and I have to love
[1:12:59] [Music]
[1:13:01] you because you're his servant as
[1:13:06] well not just the one that's up
[1:13:09] there but each and every one of you are
[1:13:13] servants and brother BR says and I
[1:13:15] happily
[1:13:17] say and with much
[1:13:21] Grace I love you with all my heart
[1:13:24] and that's
[1:13:26] true and now just to make a turn the
[1:13:29] corner
[1:13:30] [Music]
[1:13:32] here and questions and answers preached
[1:13:34] in
[1:13:35] [Music]
[1:13:39] 1959 and love is the most powerful force
[1:13:42] there is in the
[1:13:43] world
[1:13:45] now if you
[1:13:48] notice a devil is always
[1:13:52] hate
[1:13:54] a devil is always hate
[1:13:58] period and he repeats it once again hate
[1:14:01] is of the
[1:14:04] devil and when people hate
[1:14:07] someone
[1:14:10] remember it is a terrible
[1:14:13] devil to despise or
[1:14:17] dislike it's a terrible
[1:14:22] devil to despise or dislike our
[1:14:26] Brethren and brother Bram says you
[1:14:28] mustn't do
[1:14:31] that but can a person really know their
[1:14:36] heart who you really
[1:14:41] love or can you notice when you really
[1:14:43] love
[1:14:46] someone we should examine ourselves with
[1:14:48] the
[1:14:50] word love your enemies
[1:14:56] bless them that curse
[1:14:59] you do good to them that hate
[1:15:03] you and for me the most powerful of them
[1:15:08] all and pray for those that
[1:15:12] persecute pray for them with
[1:15:15] love place them into the hands of the
[1:15:19] Lord ask the Lord for guidance and
[1:15:22] direction
[1:15:24] not just only for
[1:15:25] me but also for my
[1:15:28] enemy the one that
[1:15:30] persecutes the one that curses me the
[1:15:34] one that hates
[1:15:35] me if you wouldn't mind closing your
[1:15:38] [Music]
[1:15:40] eyes I heard a preaching from our
[1:15:42] brother Johnny and he
[1:15:44] said he said these
[1:15:47] words I
[1:15:49] [Music]
[1:15:51] want that when when they hear about
[1:15:53] Jericho
[1:15:57] Tabernacle I don't want it to be
[1:16:01] known that we're so tremendous in the
[1:16:06] message that we know so much about the
[1:16:11] Bible I don't want this church to be
[1:16:13] known for
[1:16:14] [Music]
[1:16:17] that I want this church to be known
[1:16:21] for where everybody loves one
[1:16:26] another this is what brother Johnny
[1:16:30] said when this church was only 5 months
[1:16:35] old now we're at 5 years in this
[1:16:41] church I want this church to be known
[1:16:46] for where everybody loves one
[1:16:49] another Heavenly
[1:16:51] Father we thank thank
[1:16:55] you for this word that you gave us this
[1:16:59] evening we don't want to hate anyone
[1:17:04] Lord and we don't want to feed that root
[1:17:06] of
[1:17:09] bitterness even though it's so easy
[1:17:11] being in this
[1:17:14] flesh because the devil attacks us day
[1:17:16] and
[1:17:19] night and he uses our own brothers and
[1:17:22] sisters in our church
[1:17:23] [Music]
[1:17:25] but if we can
[1:17:26] recognize if we can
[1:17:28] see that it's not our
[1:17:30] brother it's not our
[1:17:33] sister but there are the Spiritual
[1:17:36] Beings they're the Devils from
[1:17:40] hell that anoint our brothers and
[1:17:44] sisters from the head to
[1:17:46] toe we are no
[1:17:50] exception Lord help us to love
[1:17:53] to love and
[1:17:57] love and don't permit any root of
[1:17:59] bitterness be grown in our
[1:18:03] heart so that we may fulfill those words
[1:18:06] that our brother Johnny used to
[1:18:08] say and even more than
[1:18:13] that to fulfill those words of the Holy
[1:18:18] Scripture the word of
[1:18:21] God to love th
[1:18:24] neighbor we ask you this
[1:18:27] even in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:18:29] Christ amen
