[43:23] you have found yourself in the balance
[43:26] and you have found yourself wanting
[43:29] amen
[43:31] please bow your heads
[43:35] you can close your eyes so we can
[43:37] approach the author of the word
[43:44] thank you this morning

[43:51] Lord we're here ready for service
[43:56] Lord we'll be able to take preeminence

[44:07] receive your world
[44:09] we want to thank the musicians

[44:18] in order Lord

[44:23] the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
[44:26] hey man you guys may be seated
[44:34] hey man you guys love the Lord this
[44:36] morning amen
[44:41] and it's more like to continue in the
[44:43] message we've been following with
[44:48] and it's putting all things in Balance
[44:53] our subtitle our Focus this morning is
[44:57] the Agents of God Amen
[45:03] we're asking that the Lord could help us
[45:06] and bless us this morning
[45:41] sometimes we want to follow a certain
[45:43] road
[45:44] but God's not on that road amen yeah
[45:51] sometimes we take a certain quote from
[45:54] the prophet
[45:56] or a certain scripture of the Bible
[46:02] sometimes we stick or we grab hold tight
[46:04] of that that scripture
[46:06] and no one can
[46:19] Anton says
[46:22] and then at that point you're out of
[46:24] balance
[46:26] but if you could take their brothers
[46:30] and the other quote from the other
[46:32] brothers
[46:33] and put them on God's scale Anton says
[46:37] then we could be in balance
[46:42] in Proverbs it tells us that a a false
[46:45] balance
[46:47] it's an abomination in God's eyes
[46:51] but a correct balance it's pleasing to
[46:54] the Lord
[46:58] but when we find ourselves with a quote
[47:00] from the prophets
[47:03] everything that the prophet says about
[47:05] that amen Brothers
[47:10] says oh well I heard the prophet said
[47:12] this
[47:13] but seek out everything that the prophet
[47:16] said about that
[47:21] our elderly brothers were preaching a
[47:23] very beautiful message
[47:30] they were talking about dreams and
[47:33] visions and speaking in tongues and
[47:34] Prophets
[47:36] and how God speaks to us to those gifts
[47:40] but the main thing is
[47:42] the way that God speaks to us
[47:45] is through his word
[47:47] amen brothers
[47:49] let's go let's take a little example
[47:52] here
[47:52] a very simple example
[47:57] let's say we're going to have a voting
[48:01] but someone speaks in tongues
[48:05] and it says in speaking in tongues he
[48:07] says this is the person that will take
[48:09] that place
[48:11] what should we do
[48:13] are we going to go with the person that
[48:15] spoke in tongues
[48:16] when the word of God tells us
[48:20] to place it in voting animals amen
[48:24] Brothers
[49:17] what the word of God says
[49:20] amen amen
[49:22] is
[49:26] so this morning we're going to speak
[49:28] about God's agents
[49:30] amen Brothers
[49:32] the prophet says yes
[49:37] and that's the reason I believe those
[49:39] Visions
[49:42] because it's always declared to me the
[49:45] truth
[49:46] because it comes from the word
[49:49] amen Brothers
[49:52] the prophet says why do you think I
[49:54] believe that Vision
[49:56] because it coincides with the world
[49:58] because it sounds beautiful
[50:02] because it benefits
[50:05] because it goes along with what the word
[50:07] says
[50:10] and if he says it is
[50:15] when it's declared like that
[50:19] there's no more guesswork is
[50:22] it's going to be and
[50:31] tonsamento because it's beyond the human
[50:34] things
[50:38] it's up in the Realms of the Lord's
[50:40] thinking
[50:42] but you're standing you're standing here
[50:50] just as a branch producing the fruit
[50:53] that's in the vine vein see
[50:56] now notice what the prophet says yes God
[51:00] USA uses
[51:11] God doesn't use Machinery
[51:14] God doesn't use groups
[51:17] God doesn't use organizations
[51:25] he's always done it this way
[51:31] this is going to get nice
[51:36] and on the pool of beces
[51:40] the water chopped
[51:43] the trouble the waters were trouble
[51:47] and whoever stepped in there
[51:53] is
[51:58] look what a great water I am no no
[52:02] it was the Angels
[52:08] during the healing
[52:11] not the water it was the
[52:14] angels and when the angel went away
[52:18] it was just water
[52:40] a human flesh
[52:45] but sometimes we want a different roads
[52:52] and dreams
[52:57] speak to us
[53:17] amen Brothers
[53:23] that's God's way that's the way God does
[53:25] it
[53:27] God doesn't let us fall in denominations
[53:32] that doesn't let us fall on mechanical
[53:35] devices
[53:45] man is God's ages
[53:48] and the hardest thing is
[53:52] the God has ever had to do is
[53:57] for one mortal to believe another
[54:00] the most difficult thing for God is
[54:04] for this man I believe the other man
[54:09] OS amen Brothers is that the truth
[54:13] man
[54:23] they say
[54:25] greneso
[54:26] he said you believe that
[54:29] they couldn't believe Moses
[54:38] and God has given two signs to prove to
[54:41] the people that he was sent from God to
[54:43] for their Deliverance
[54:47] he's the same yesterday today
[54:52] the same way that he worked back then
[54:54] he's going to work today
[54:57] the way he's working today
[54:59] he'll work tomorrow
[55:13] I have some the definition and some
[55:15] synonyms
[55:19] an agent is a person who acts on behalf
[55:22] of another person or group
[55:24] it's a representative
[56:05] and place them in Balance yeah
[56:39] and that's the only thing that God
[56:40] needed foreign
[57:20] is nothing
[57:25] sometimes we believe we're something
[57:27] great
[57:27] because
[57:29] I have gifts
[57:32] but if you don't have God
[57:34] you're nothing
[57:37] man
[57:39] amen amen
[57:45] Peter said that mountain is
[57:50] Transfiguration he said no
[57:54] it's the holy spirit
[57:57] that made that mountain holy it's not
[58:00] the mountain
[58:07] I don't accept that okay what if I were
[58:11] to tell you
[58:12] that if God is a spirit
[58:16] and Juan Capitola
[58:22] I don't have it okay
[58:25] John 4 24. it says God is Spirit
[58:32] amen amen
[58:51] amen Brothers
[58:58] the first Christians 1 11
[59:03] the Apostle Paul tells us
[59:25] he says follow me
[59:35] telling other men
[59:37] follow me
[59:41] just as I follow Christ amen amen
[59:46] that's God's way
[59:48] it's a it's a continuance
[59:52] follows Christ and we follow Paul amen
[59:56] amen
[59:59] followers
[1:00:02] imitators
[1:00:10] it's an imitator
[1:00:12] another thing is to be a follower
[1:00:38] [Music]
[1:00:43] how many have heard that
[1:00:47] you are the leader
[1:00:50] go to the sixth sale hey
[1:00:55] begins to talk about going beyond the
[1:00:57] curtain of time
[1:01:01] he says you are the leader
[1:01:06] and you shall first be judged
[1:01:11] it says here the patience of Paul
[1:01:13] Pakistan here they are and so the
[1:01:16] Glorious the glory to God
[1:01:18] because what Paul preach I have also
[1:01:22] preached it
[1:02:02] that want to run away
[1:02:04] foreign
[1:02:35] that I will be there too
[1:02:38] amen again Siegel stand who do you
[1:02:41] follow oh they see your alien you follow
[1:02:43] somebody

[1:02:52] God is a spirit yes
[1:02:56] in his vessels
[1:03:03] that's fine
[1:03:09] but you're going to follow somebody
[1:03:53] at the head of his church and of his
[1:03:57] people
[1:03:58] Brothers

[1:05:25] had the charge of all her treasure and
[1:05:27] had come to Jerusalem for to worship
[1:05:31] so here we see Phillips
[1:05:36] we see that the angel of the Lord Felipe
[1:05:39] had spoke to Phillip
[1:05:42] he said get up and go through this road
[1:05:48] we saw in verse 27 that the Ethiopian
[1:05:51] man
[1:05:55] what is it
[1:05:59] well eunuch is a man that has saved his
[1:06:01] virginity
[1:06:03] that has a lot of authority
[1:06:05] is a safeguarder amen Brothers
[1:06:09] in another message
[1:06:12] the prophet says that the ten virgins
[1:06:16] I'll just leave that there is
[1:06:23] and the eunuch was in charge of all the
[1:06:25] treasures of this queen yes
[1:06:29] and the smell went to Jerusalem to
[1:06:31] worship
[1:06:32] he went searching for something
[1:06:35] he went to Jerusalem
[1:06:39] the most religious place in the whole
[1:06:42] entire world to worship
[1:06:48] now we're seeing the unit returning back
[1:06:50] to his home Anton says verse 28
[1:06:58] was returning and sitting in his Chariot
[1:07:01] read isaiis the prophet
[1:07:06] so the unit opened up the scriptures
[1:07:11] and he began to read
[1:07:15] as the Sheep took to the slaughterhouse
[1:07:19] in that in that manner
[1:07:22] pay then Philip approached him
[1:07:25] verse 29 is
[1:07:32] and join thyself to this charioto Felipe
[1:07:39] and Philip heard that he was reading
[1:07:42] tether to him
[1:07:45] so Philip made a question to this
[1:07:48] unites do you understand what you are
[1:07:52] reading
[1:07:55] that's a question to ask each and every
[1:07:57] one of you this morning

[1:12:24] amen
[1:12:28] what is that Deacon doing over there
[1:12:32] is
[1:13:20] that is where it's declared the perfect
[1:13:22] will of God
[1:13:24] all right amen
[1:13:30] I don't want to follow that man he yells
[1:13:32] too much
[1:13:39] amen the prophet says here
[1:13:43] now here we're going to get into
[1:13:45] something like
[1:13:48] now we look at the Sea church
[1:13:51] [Music]
[1:13:55] this real church with the real true
[1:13:58] sperm not the eleno
[1:14:02] now notice the eunuch it had been with
[1:14:05] all the doctors of divinity now remember
[1:14:09] no this man went to Jerusalem
[1:14:12] the most religious place around the
[1:14:14] earth
[1:14:15] doctors of divinity
[1:14:17] and did not find himself
[1:14:23] and he left empty
[1:14:38] to an angel
[1:14:41] you want an angel to come down
[1:14:49] with beautiful Wings
[1:14:51] put the Halo on his head no it's yours
[1:14:57] they couldn't speak Spanish
[1:15:01] Brothers
[1:15:19] how many know that in Galatians
[1:15:26] who comes from heaven and preaches
[1:15:28] anything other than what he preached
[1:15:30] let him be cursed is
[1:15:53] he came below foreign
[1:16:13] amen Brothers
[1:16:16] he says
[1:16:19] he said descends below
[1:16:21] and gave him to men
[1:16:24] who were Sons
[1:16:31] now he never committed to the angels
[1:16:38] He had been in Pentacles
[1:16:41] Jerusalem to worship
[1:16:43] how many men say Amen to them
[1:16:49] maybe not the eunuch had been with all
[1:16:51] the doctors of divinity
[1:16:54] but why didn't he receive anything
[1:16:57] because he had went to Jerusalem why
[1:17:01] didn't he receive it receive anything
[1:17:05] he went back downstairs studying Isaiah
[1:17:10] although the angel directed to Philip
[1:17:13] but the germ of Life
[1:17:17] had to come to the body
[1:17:31] through the angel
[1:17:33] foreign
[1:18:22] just like each and every one of us all
[1:18:24] about this house we're baptized in the
[1:18:26] Water
[1:18:28] The Gift of the Holy ghosts
[1:18:32] inside the body of God
[1:18:35] we have got seed inside of us
[1:18:43] and that's where children can be
[1:18:45] produced
[1:18:52] the message
[1:18:55] he found himself
[1:18:59] fertile ground ready to receive the
[1:19:01] germs
[1:19:05] if nobody can guide me
[1:19:15] into the universe
[1:19:45] God has got seed
[1:19:48] okay
[1:19:51] now we see what a seed is
[1:19:57] when you see that there's a nut
[1:20:01] you see the cut the has like a shark or
[1:20:05] a shell
[1:20:06] and you open the Shelf
[1:20:10] the the nut comes out
[1:20:14] so there's stages for that seed
[1:20:17] amen
[1:20:23] this is the the prophet speaks the
[1:20:26] message the air shall not be seed with
[1:20:27] the shack
[1:20:30] we see that the shack
[1:20:32] has a purpose
[1:20:34] it's to protect
[1:20:37] the seed
[1:20:39] have anyone amen Brothers
[1:20:45] oh brother it's garbage
[1:20:47] it has a purpose
[1:20:54] to protect the seed
[1:20:58] foreign
[1:21:34] now we have our little groups
[1:21:38] there shouldn't be any groups
[1:21:42] let's say I have my little groups
[1:21:51] can hang out with the holies
[1:21:58] the moment
[1:22:01] of my group
[1:22:03] I identify myself
[1:22:22] identify yourself with the sugar
[1:22:25] that is a denomination
[1:22:36] and you go to the ground you are worth
[1:22:40] nothing
[1:23:17] you have turned yourself into a
[1:23:19] denomination
[1:23:29] [Music]
[1:23:40] if you don't believe
[1:23:43] it because
[1:23:48] we don't have anymore
[1:23:50] those doors are open to everybody
[1:23:54] foreign
[1:24:42] hold up
[1:24:44] come on how does the dragon speak
[1:24:48] that's my first question
[1:24:50] number two
[1:24:52] who is the dragon
[1:24:57] God says
[1:25:03] I understand there's more quotes
[1:25:13] how does the dragon speak
[1:25:15] you want to see how the dragon speaks
[1:25:19] we have to go to Genesis
[1:25:22] everything is found in Genesis
[1:25:25] everything
[1:25:31] that's why the devil hates Genesis and
[1:25:34] Revelations
[1:25:36] we see in Genesis chapter 3
[1:25:40] what are the serpent approach
[1:25:44] he came close to the world he didn't
[1:25:47] approach the man
[1:25:48] he approached the woman
[1:25:50] and what did the woman tell him
[1:25:53] destruction
[1:26:12] no no no
[1:26:14] how did the serpent speak
[1:26:17] he says you look very pretty
[1:26:37] not this
[1:26:53] that's what God wants to say no no no no
[1:27:00] yes
[1:27:06] because they've dropped the bars
[1:27:13] [Music]
[1:27:22] that little calm
[1:27:33] it's fine
[1:27:39] they became a man by the name of John
[1:27:41] the Baptist
[1:27:44] Anointed with the spirit of Allah
[1:27:49] he had an ax
[1:28:05] of the tree
[1:28:23] I'm a saint
[1:28:34] uses the man yes
[1:28:41] of the tree
[1:28:45] we'll be closing though
[1:28:48] it's a propheta the prophet says
[1:29:03] he didn't give the message to an angel
[1:29:05] he gave it to the Man
[1:29:12] the scripture says
[1:29:16] follow me the way I follow Christ
[1:29:24] this morning
[1:29:27] the prophet tells us
[1:29:33] Prophet says never trust any man
[1:29:38] what do we do now
[1:29:48] brother you just told me that those are
[1:29:50] God's agents
[1:30:08] it sticks to that quote
[1:30:15] placed them on God's scale foreign
[1:30:36] never trust any man
[1:30:40] important I don't care who he is
[1:30:44] if he's a holy man
[1:30:48] she has Bueno if he's good
[1:30:53] there is no such thing

[1:32:56] God can use them yes
[1:33:01] you don't believe it

[1:33:09] equilibrium put it on the balance
[1:33:23] the prophet says
[1:33:25] Santo is God holy
[1:33:28] Santo not a holy man
[1:33:32] the Holy Spirit
[1:33:36] once offered it to the holy mountains
[1:33:48] it was the holy God that found him on
[1:33:51] that mountain
[1:33:53] not the holy church
[1:33:56] holy God in that church
[1:34:20] he will fail
[1:34:23] is
[1:34:25] a failure to begin with
[1:34:28] anyone
[1:34:32] the greatest of the men's will fall
[1:34:45] never put your trust

[1:36:40] others
