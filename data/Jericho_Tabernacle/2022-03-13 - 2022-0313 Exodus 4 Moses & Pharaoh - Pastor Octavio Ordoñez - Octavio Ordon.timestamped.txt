[1:01:39] exodus uh this is the fourth uh message
[1:01:47] as a subtitle i wrote down uh moses and
[1:01:50] pharaoh
[1:02:01] i thought that was pretty interesting
[1:02:08] i wanted to
[1:02:09] give a review of what we've spoken
[1:02:17] was in the desert land of midian
[1:02:23] hurting his flock
[1:02:26] he was said to inherit his
[1:02:28] father-in-law's possessions
[1:02:32] he had
[1:02:39] so moses was doing pretty good on his
[1:02:41] own
[1:02:44] he had a wife and a son
[1:02:46] esposa
[1:03:00] but he saw the burning bush
[1:03:06] he's changed everything yes
[1:03:09] that's changed his life
[1:03:12] he had no choice now our yeah
[1:03:29] and he couldn't put it aside anymore
[1:03:33] he must have thought of all those things
[1:03:35] that his mom told him
[1:03:40] he was born for a purpose
[1:03:48] he had a special task to do in his life
[1:03:55] all those thoughts must have come back
[1:03:57] to him
[1:04:00] once he had met god
[1:04:04] when he met god
[1:04:10] the burning bush
[1:04:13] he showed him a couple of uh
[1:04:15] of
[1:04:16] of uh tokens
[1:04:20] the rod turned into a snake
[1:04:25] being the type of the judge
[1:04:28] serpent
[1:04:31] he was to get it by the tail
[1:04:35] and it would turn back into a rock is
[1:05:06] doesn't
[1:05:33] he tried to serve the lord his own way
[1:05:38] he went out and killed pence
[1:05:41] no one followed him
[1:05:44] instead they accused them
[1:05:47] so iran
[1:06:29] that's just the way i am
[1:06:33] i've always liked to go camping
[1:06:37] it's nice to sit out there by a lake
[1:06:42] just watch nature
[1:06:45] it's a very relaxing atmosphere
[1:06:50] but moses
[1:06:53] was called for a purpose
[1:06:57] now let's let's
[1:06:58] uh let's see what moses told god when he
[1:07:02] met him
[1:07:06] i told him but i i can't even speak
[1:07:10] i
[1:07:12] started and it's all right well aaron's
[1:07:15] on his way
[1:07:19] so what else
[1:07:22] well they won't believe me
[1:07:24] so okay well i'll show you some science
[1:07:32] he ran out of excuses
[1:07:36] so here he goes on his way
[1:07:40] but he forgot one thing
[1:07:44] he forgot to circumcise his own son
[1:07:48] i think that's also a type
[1:07:52] we try and go and help everyone
[1:08:11] [Music]
[1:08:22] how can we be a light to the world in
[1:08:24] darkness in our own home podemos
[1:08:30] how can we want to go out and evangelize
[1:08:32] and travel and do things when our own
[1:08:35] home is falling
[1:09:02] his wife helped them
[1:09:04] and uh
[1:09:06] i got a uh some
[1:09:08] question here
[1:09:09] uh
[1:09:13] there's a question on questions and
[1:09:15] answers number two
[1:09:17] uh
[1:09:33] please explain exodus 24 the fourth
[1:09:36] chapter and the 24th verse
[1:09:45] what does this scripture mean
[1:09:49] the god aimed to kill moses or his son
[1:09:52] and why
[1:09:57] we know where that's at exodus 4 24.
[1:10:05] that's a good question
[1:10:09] here we'll read it right here just a
[1:10:11] moment exodus 4 24. you can take out
[1:10:14] your bibles and look at it
[1:10:22] and it came to pass by the way
[1:10:25] in the end that the lord met him and
[1:10:28] sought to kill him
[1:10:39] now god gave abraham generations before
[1:10:43] moses
[1:10:44] the sign of circumcision
[1:10:51] and that was a covenant that god made
[1:10:54] that every jew should be circumcised
[1:11:02] is that right
[1:11:05] every man should be
[1:11:07] that's a sign
[1:11:10] of and we are circumcised today
[1:11:17] with the holy spirit not by flesh
[1:11:24] no no god gave this commandment
[1:11:29] and every male must be circumcised
[1:11:35] and god when he called moses to go down
[1:11:38] there and deliver the children of israel
[1:11:47] moses hadn't performed on his own sons
[1:11:50] the very delivering sign
[1:12:01] would be like me saying all the church
[1:12:04] now every one of you you come in and be
[1:12:08] baptized here with water
[1:12:11] and we put you on the church membership
[1:12:15] is
[1:12:26] we're all going to glory together
[1:12:30] why brother that's not scripture hermano
[1:12:34] is unless you are born again
[1:12:39] circumcised of the holy spirit
[1:12:44] you've got to be us
[1:12:46] i don't care how good you are in
[1:12:57] except you as an individual has been
[1:13:00] born again by the holy ghost except
[1:13:16] except you as an individual
[1:13:19] has been born again by the holy ghost
[1:13:23] you'll never go in the rapture okay
[1:13:26] except
[1:13:35] that's the very delivering sign the
[1:13:38] circumcision and the circumcision is by
[1:13:42] the holy spirit
[1:13:52] now god the the questioner
[1:13:55] asks this does
[1:13:57] does the scripture mean that god ain't
[1:13:59] to kill moses or his son
[1:14:11] and why
[1:14:26] sometimes our wives gets us out of
[1:14:28] trouble right
[1:14:29] now
[1:14:31] sometimes our wives are our
[1:14:34] our right hand
[1:14:35] this is
[1:14:51] foreign
[1:15:05] was the only one that saved him there is
[1:15:13] got a sharp rock and
[1:15:15] went and cut the foreskin of her baby
[1:15:25] and threw it before moses and sent our
[1:15:27] bloody husband to me is that right
[1:15:35] and god would have took moses life but
[1:15:38] perhaps
[1:15:39] an angel was standing there said
[1:15:42] sephiroth
[1:15:44] catch it quickly
[1:15:54] went and circumcised the baby said moses
[1:15:57] you're so concerned about everything
[1:15:59] else and about your journey that your
[1:16:02] own boy hasn't been circumcised
[1:16:15] [Music]
[1:16:17] they both had a character right
[1:16:21] there separate was kind of kind of rough
[1:16:23] and so was moses
[1:16:29] now let's go to exodus
[1:16:31] 5 1.
[1:16:35] and afterwards moses and aaron went in
[1:16:39] and told pharaoh thus says the lord
[1:16:42] god of israel let my people go
[1:16:46] that they may hold a feast unto me in
[1:16:49] the wilderness
[1:17:01] and pearl said who is the lord
[1:17:04] that i should obey his voice to let
[1:17:07] israel go
[1:17:10] respond
[1:17:15] israel
[1:17:16] i know not the lord neither will i let
[1:17:19] israel go jono
[1:17:26] i know not the lord neither will i let
[1:17:29] israel go
[1:17:31] giovanni
[1:17:34] you have a man of god
[1:17:40] promised birth
[1:17:50] coming before a man that did not know
[1:17:52] god miniendo ante
[1:17:56] a
[1:18:10] some do you remember the story that
[1:18:13] brother bran tells us about
[1:18:15] the man who
[1:18:17] had a sign on his chest or in his front
[1:18:20] so
[1:19:15] let's see what pharaoh does when
[1:19:18] when told to let israel go aura
[1:19:26] as soon as he hurt the first time
[1:19:31] he had the jews there for 400 plus years
[1:19:41] did not know who joseph was yes
[1:19:46] jose enslaved all of israel
[1:19:52] he was a top gun of the world at that
[1:19:54] time
[1:19:58] he was a man
[1:20:00] no one was above him that he know
[1:20:03] [Music]
[1:20:16] so when he heard to let the people go
[1:20:22] he took off the straws
[1:20:25] for israel to make bricks without them
[1:20:30] israel had to go run out and get
[1:20:32] stubbles or whatever they can find
[1:20:39] but let's backtrack a little bit
[1:20:43] before
[1:20:44] moses and aaron
[1:20:46] went before pharaoh
[1:20:51] first went to the elders
[1:20:55] and told the elders
[1:20:58] showed the
[1:21:25] so moses and aaron were sent back to
[1:21:27] them
[1:21:29] foreign
[1:21:34] tell them everything was
[1:21:36] going to be fine
[1:21:37] foreign
[1:21:42] and they complain
[1:21:47] exodus 7 1.
[1:21:49] exodus
[1:21:51] and the lord said unto moses
[1:21:53] see i have made thee a god to pharaoh
[1:21:57] and aaron thy brother shall be a prophet
[1:22:07] thou shalt speak
[1:22:09] all that i
[1:22:10] command thee and aaron thy brother shall
[1:22:13] speak unto pharaoh
[1:22:16] that he send
[1:22:17] the children of israel out of this land
[1:22:29] and i will hearten pharaoh's heart and
[1:22:32] multiply my signs and my wonders in the
[1:22:36] land of
[1:23:04] didn't even really have a chance
[1:23:09] he was raised to pause
[1:23:19] pharaoh was shown a miracle
[1:23:21] aaron's rod turned to a serpent
[1:23:24] but so did the magicians
[1:23:27] turn
[1:23:28] a rod into a serpent
[1:23:51] moses so do these also resist the truth
[1:23:55] men are corrupt minds reprobate
[1:23:57] concerning the faith is
[1:24:10] so aaron's rod
[1:24:13] that had turned into a snake swallowed
[1:24:15] up the others
[1:24:20] now the next day
[1:24:24] at the river in rio they turned the
[1:24:28] river red
[1:24:40] the river turned into red as blood
[1:24:57] dig wells to get water
[1:25:01] and what did pharaoh do in case of our
[1:25:03] own he just went into his house
[1:25:07] then another warning to pearl
[1:25:10] but he refused so the land was full of
[1:25:13] frogs
[1:25:24] and the magicians did the same thing
[1:25:28] prairie then called moses and asked them
[1:25:30] to remove the frogs
[1:25:36] yeah i find this really interesting
[1:25:41] moses goes and tells okay when do you
[1:25:42] want the raw frogs removed
[1:25:49] you would think he would have said
[1:25:50] immediately
[1:26:03] you're
[1:26:04] two three feet deep in frogs and you say
[1:26:06] well
[1:26:25] but
[1:26:26] the magicians could not bring forth lies
[1:26:32] they were now convinced
[1:26:34] it was the finger of god
[1:26:40] exodus 8 18.
[1:26:46] and the magicians did so with their
[1:26:48] enchantments to bring forth lies
[1:26:51] but
[1:26:52] they could not
[1:26:54] so there were lies upon man and upon
[1:26:58] beasts
[1:27:10] then the magician said unto pearl this
[1:27:12] is the finger of god
[1:27:14] and pharaoh's heart was hardened
[1:27:17] and he hearkened not unto them as the
[1:27:20] lord had said
[1:27:22] entonces
[1:27:29] is
[1:27:53] then wanted to let the people go
[1:27:59] but as soon as the flies were removed
[1:28:04] he changed his heart
[1:28:08] he changed his mind
[1:28:12] i
[1:28:12] wonder
[1:28:14] if some people are like that
[1:28:18] when something happens
[1:28:26] i'll serve you this time yes
[1:28:28] i'll be for real this time
[1:28:32] they're healed
[1:28:34] they're giving what they want
[1:28:37] and they're gone
[1:28:56] they're gone
[1:28:59] isn't that something
[1:29:02] we've seen it throughout the year es alo
[1:29:05] que mos vistas
[1:29:10] let's read a little bit of the message
[1:29:15] let's prove that there was no
[1:29:18] nothing happening in gershon
[1:29:23] egypt was being
[1:29:25] was being hammered
[1:29:29] they were being hurt
[1:29:33] but in gerson
[1:29:35] everything was called
[1:29:51] the ever-present water from the rock
[1:29:57] and israel
[1:29:59] as a historical type had to take this
[1:30:02] chastisement
[1:30:08] now when they were down in egypt
[1:30:11] and god sent moses
[1:30:16] and he stretched forth the rod and flies
[1:30:19] and lies come on the ground
[1:30:26] he stretched forward
[1:30:28] forth forward to
[1:30:30] forward to
[1:30:31] four
[1:30:33] towards the sun sexton diocea el sol
[1:30:36] and it went down
[1:30:39] it stretched it over the waters and they
[1:30:41] turned to blood
[1:30:45] why israel was over in canaan's over in
[1:30:50] goshen
[1:30:54] just having a glorious time establishing
[1:30:57] tiempo glorioso the sun never went down
[1:31:11] just like you did when you first got
[1:31:13] saved
[1:31:16] everything the birds sang different and
[1:31:19] everybody was sweet
[1:31:26] i know my how everything was just dandy
[1:31:29] when you first got saved
[1:31:35] then come the trying time
[1:31:41] the sanctifying time
[1:31:51] laying aside the ways that those does so
[1:31:54] easily besets you the spoken
[1:31:59] you a man have to stop your smoking
[1:32:04] you're drinking
[1:32:06] stop
[1:32:07] you're going to the pool room your
[1:32:09] all-night car parties
[1:32:23] all those things you had to
[1:32:25] sanctify yourself from them
[1:32:32] by the faith in the blood of jesus
[1:32:34] christ
[1:32:38] sanctifying yourself santificano
[1:32:41] you women have to let your hair grow out
[1:32:47] lengthen your dresses
[1:32:50] and act
[1:32:51] like
[1:32:52] different than what you was
[1:32:58] sanctifying time
[1:33:02] many times they would rebel and go back
[1:33:05] muchas versus
[1:33:12] see a child of god looks straight at
[1:33:15] calvary
[1:33:20] and knows that's it
[1:33:22] for his good isabel
[1:33:26] that is
[1:33:28] for his own good ques
[1:33:31] why do you do all those things
[1:33:49] someone
[1:33:50] good
[1:33:52] you have to bring it home
[1:33:58] so then the process of time
[1:34:00] there's where the great falling away
[1:34:10] when this great crowding in time
[1:34:14] then the people began to fall away from
[1:34:17] one side to the other side
[1:34:26] then in the shading well we wish we were
[1:34:29] back down in egypt our
[1:34:33] [Music]
[1:34:42] in other words if i would take it
[1:34:44] historically now
[1:34:46] that's what they said
[1:34:53] i was out drinking all night
[1:34:58] it was out smoking partying
[1:35:03] now in the modern day it would be
[1:35:06] oh every wednesday night prayer meeting
[1:35:24] the same thing the preachers stand up
[1:35:27] and preach
[1:35:31] sons go on
[1:35:33] back
[1:35:37] see then you're just going as a line of
[1:35:41] duty
[1:35:45] you're not a worshiper
[1:35:48] a worshiper goes there to worship
[1:35:53] to express himself before
[1:36:08] yeah
[1:36:11] questions and answers uh
[1:36:14] 5307 29.
[1:36:22] now look back in the old testament
[1:36:24] when you see
[1:36:25] the plagues falling
[1:36:27] they were in egypt
[1:36:37] and god was bringing his people out
[1:36:40] to the promised land is that right
[1:36:47] and israel never received one plague
[1:36:50] israel
[1:37:05] no mosquitoes come no frogs was there no
[1:37:09] lies
[1:37:10] was there no storms was there no
[1:37:12] lightning was there no killing on the
[1:37:15] cattle was there and everything
[1:37:19] they had
[1:37:20] was preserved in goshen
[1:37:43] listen to this real carefully okay our
[1:37:45] presidency
[1:37:48] is that right it's the type of the
[1:37:50] church going just before the tribulation
[1:37:54] period
[1:38:00] is jesus said when these things begin to
[1:38:04] come to pass jesus
[1:38:07] christ
[1:38:09] lift up your head for your redemption is
[1:38:12] dying
[1:38:26] in christ jesus is
[1:38:46] the holy spirit guiding us taking care
[1:38:49] of us
[1:38:53] today
[1:38:55] we will be okay
[1:39:10] then they said that go ahead and read it
[1:39:13] and said
[1:39:18] a man run hide themselves in the and
[1:39:21] fall upon their sought to kill
[1:39:24] themselves and couldn't do it and
[1:39:27] everything i believe
[1:39:29] that takes the place just before the
[1:39:32] tribulation
[1:39:34] los ambres
[1:39:38] causes
[1:39:50] the tribulation comes
[1:40:02] just an ordinary church without the holy
[1:40:05] ghost
[1:40:07] goes through the tribulation period
[1:40:16] it's only the leg that goes through
[1:40:19] los alex
[1:40:29] okay then what happens next back to the
[1:40:32] story
[1:40:34] is
[1:40:49] the boils were
[1:40:51] on the egyptians and the magicians
[1:40:58] exodus 9 13 exodus
[1:41:10] and the lord said unto moses
[1:41:12] rise up early in the morning and stand
[1:41:15] before pharaoh and say unto him thus
[1:41:18] says the lord
[1:41:19] god of the hebrews let my people go that

[1:43:52] cause it to rain a very grievous hell

[1:43:59] foundation thereof even until now

[1:44:54] thunder and hell with fire those who
[1:44:57] feared the word of the lord brought
[1:45:00] everything inside their homes
[1:45:12] but in gerson there was nothing
[1:45:19] after that the pharaoh
[1:45:23] the pharaoh refused god
[1:45:28] you still refuse
[1:45:56] he
[1:46:14] darkness fell for three days that could
[1:46:17] be felt
[1:46:18] inevitable
[1:46:21] but there was light
[1:46:23] at gerson
[1:46:36] and all the first born in the land of
[1:46:38] jesus shall die
[1:46:44] no the first born in the land of egypt
[1:46:47] shall die

[1:46:57] firstborn of the maidservant that is
[1:47:00] behind the mill
[1:47:02] and all the first born of beasts
[1:47:19] and there shall be a great crime
[1:47:21] throughout all the land of egypt
[1:47:28] such as there was none like it nor shall
[1:47:32] be like it anymore
[1:47:36] when the rapture takes place
[1:47:42] what do you think is going to happen to
[1:47:43] those left behind
[1:47:46] from the house
[1:47:48] what crime will you be hearing
[1:47:52] we won't hear it
[1:47:58] but the cry of the people
[1:48:01] pueblo knowing that they had an
[1:48:04] opportunity
[1:48:08] they had an opportunity to go before god
[1:48:14] and ask for forgiveness
[1:48:42] but against any of the children of
[1:48:45] israel shall not adopt
[1:48:48] movies

[1:49:17] the difference between a believer and a
[1:49:19] non-believer
[1:49:22] we are the outballs
[1:49:26] we are the outcome
[1:49:29] we are the weird ones that go to church

[1:50:11] in the land
[1:50:12] of egypt saying

[1:50:21] beginning of months

[1:51:08] unto him unto his house
[1:51:11] take it according to the number of the
[1:51:13] souls

[1:51:45] animals

[1:51:55] day of the same month and the whole
[1:51:58] assembly of the congregation of israel
[1:52:01] shall kill it in the evening
[1:52:12] they shall take the blood
[1:52:27] and they shall eat the flesh in the
[1:52:29] night
[1:52:32] rolls with fire assad
[1:52:35] and unleavened bread
[1:52:37] and with bitter herbs
[1:52:42] eat not
[1:52:53] his head with his legs and with his
[1:52:56] pertinent zero
[1:53:09] there's something that my daughter told
[1:53:10] me the other day
[1:53:13] i was telling brother emmanuel about it
[1:53:18] and
[1:53:19] i thought this was interesting
[1:53:23] my daughter said me
[1:53:39] see genesis goes all the way through
[1:53:42] revelation right
[1:53:46] now if we look at revelations chapter 10
[1:53:50] verse 8.
[1:53:52] apocalypse
[1:54:05] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[1:54:08] spake unto me again
[1:54:10] and said go and take the little book
[1:54:13] which is open in the hand of the angel
[1:54:16] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[1:54:18] earth
[1:54:30] and i went unto the angel and said unto
[1:54:32] him give me the little book
[1:54:36] and he said unto me take
[1:54:39] and eat it up
[1:54:41] and it shall make thy belly bitter but
[1:54:44] it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey
[1:54:48] if we are
[1:54:57] and i took the little book out of the
[1:54:59] angel's hand and ate it up
[1:55:02] and it was
[1:55:04] in my mouth sweet as honey
[1:55:07] and as soon as i had eaten it my belly
[1:55:10] was bitter entonces
[1:55:31] is more difficult
[1:55:32] it's really hard more difficult but as
[1:55:35] long as we want to live it
[1:55:40] that's the difference
[1:55:42] whether we want to live the world
[1:55:48] i'll i'll save the
[1:55:51] token i was going to speak on the token
[1:55:55] but a couple of things i'm running out
[1:55:57] of time and then i'm running
[1:56:12] and once we eat it up
[1:56:15] then the word of god is in us
[1:56:19] the life of christ in us
[1:56:23] so when christ comes around in the
[1:56:25] rapture enthusiasm
[1:56:40] it only comes and takes what is
[1:56:42] attracted to that magnet
[1:56:46] when christ comes
[1:56:49] he's coming back for this
[1:56:52] if this is enough
[1:56:54] we're
[1:57:02] my daughter told me that and i told the
[1:57:05] brother and i said well yeah i heard
[1:57:06] that one
[1:57:23] and thou shalt
[1:57:24] eat it
[1:57:26] with your loins girded your shoes on
[1:57:28] your feet and your staff in your hand
[1:57:31] and ye shall eat it in haste it's the
[1:57:34] lord's passover
[1:57:47] i will pass through the land of egypt
[1:57:50] this night
[1:57:51] and i will smite all the firsts born in
[1:57:55] the land of egypt but
[1:57:58] man and beasts
[1:58:00] both men and beasts and against all the
[1:58:03] gods of egypt i will execute judgment i
[1:58:07] am the lord
[1:58:23] and the blood shall be
[1:58:25] to you for a token
[1:58:28] upon the houses where ye are and when i
[1:58:32] see the black i will pass over you the
[1:58:36] plague shall not be upon you to destroy
[1:58:40] you when i spit the land of egypt
[1:58:46] in las casas
[1:59:00] next time around we'll we'll get into
[1:59:02] the the message the token
[1:59:07] and the token talks about this subject
[1:59:12] and i think the token is a tremendous
[1:59:15] message
[1:59:19] no token is something we have to apply
[1:59:21] in our lives
[1:59:25] without it
[1:59:28] you're a part of egypt
[1:59:34] you're a part of christ
[1:59:56] domingo
[2:00:09] because the word of god says let every
[2:00:11] man be a liar and the word of god be the
[2:00:12] truth
[2:00:17] so if i say anything contrary to the
[2:00:18] word of god
[2:00:24] stick to
[2:00:30] amen
