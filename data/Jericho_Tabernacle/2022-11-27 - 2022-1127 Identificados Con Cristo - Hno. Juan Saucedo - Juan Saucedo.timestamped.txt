[1:11:33] Christ amen amen
[1:11:35] you may take your seats
[1:11:41] this morning with God's help cremos
[1:11:48] con Cristo and this morning if God
[1:11:50] allows us we'd like to speak of the
[1:11:52] message identifying with
[1:11:56] Christo identifying with Christ
[1:12:01] I recommend this message
[1:12:06] this message identified with
[1:12:12] Christie
[1:12:14] he preached it on December 20th
[1:12:27] of 1959. and Jeffersonville Indiana
[1:12:30] Jeffersonville Indiana
[1:12:33] it's a message I recommend to you
[1:12:38] my brother ordonius preaches
[1:12:43] when you recommends something for us to
[1:12:45] read or listening
[1:12:51] in his preachings
[1:12:55] I have the privilege if I can say it
[1:12:58] like that is
[1:13:02] upon leaving the service
[1:13:06] grab my phone and my tablet
[1:13:11] and to seek out the message that he uh
[1:13:13] gave to us
[1:13:16] development at all and I don't get up
[1:13:18] till I listen to the whole entire
[1:13:20] message
[1:13:23] like I have a job where it allows me to
[1:13:25] listen while I'm driving alone
[1:13:29] and I can hear it multiple times
[1:13:34] but let's never get tired of listening
[1:13:37] and reading the message
[1:13:42] because let's remember that the prophet
[1:13:44] told us
[1:13:48] the message and the messenger are one no
[1:13:51] problem we cannot separate them
[1:13:57] we can only we cannot only desire the
[1:14:00] message
[1:14:03] there are many that only desire the
[1:14:05] message
[1:14:06] and not the messenger
[1:14:10] but we don't want to be like that
[1:14:16] we want to be knowers of the message
[1:14:21] but also get to know the
[1:14:24] [Music]
[1:14:26] messengerless repeat it again
[1:14:31] the message and the messenger are one
[1:14:35] you can't have one
[1:14:38] without the other simplement
[1:14:41] simply saying it can't happen
[1:14:44] you got to have both of them is
[1:14:50] speaking about identifying with Christ
[1:14:55] I read a few messages
[1:14:59] and brother Brandon says
[1:15:06] I'm identifying myself with Christ on
[1:15:09] Calvary
[1:15:13] for all believers Christians they were
[1:15:16] most star identificados con Cristo we
[1:15:20] should be identified with Christ
[1:15:23] that's why I read the Scripture
[1:15:26] it says like this one more time
[1:15:30] with Christ I'm also crucified
[1:15:35] this is a great Apostle Saint Paul is
[1:15:38] this is a great Apostle the great man of
[1:15:42] God a prophet
[1:15:44] an evangelists
[1:15:50] an example of a of a man
[1:15:55] with Christ I am also crucified
[1:16:01] saying he's identified himself of course
[1:16:05] and that's the same way that we should
[1:16:07] be the memos are starting
[1:16:10] we should be identified with Christ
[1:16:16] and I no longer live
[1:16:19] Christ
[1:16:20] that lives in me
[1:16:38] with Christ I am also crucified
[1:16:43] how many can say that this morning
[1:16:51] brother says in that message
[1:16:55] I'm going to give you a few quotes
[1:17:01] so that you could take the interest is
[1:17:04] upon going home and seek out this
[1:17:07] message
[1:17:08] and read it and read it over again
[1:17:15] because we never stop learning
[1:17:24] if you notice as we're watching
[1:17:26] something on the television
[1:17:28] [Music]
[1:17:58] that's the motive why they played so
[1:18:00] many times
[1:18:02] now I bring it like this
[1:18:06] the reason why we go to the message and
[1:18:09] we read it
[1:18:10] and we read it over again
[1:18:13] let me read it one more time
[1:18:17] sounds like a broken disc
[1:18:20] read it again
[1:18:31] and we say I believe it because he
[1:18:33] revealed it to me
[1:18:34] not because my dad believes it not
[1:18:37] because
[1:18:39] my sister
[1:18:43] because he has revealed it to me
[1:18:47] it has to be a personal revelation
[1:18:51] each and every one of us
[1:18:54] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:18:57] and when it's a revelation to us
[1:18:59] [Applause]
[1:19:02] no one can take it from you nobody
[1:19:06] so number La Gloria
[1:19:10] when they told me
[1:19:14] over there in 1976
[1:19:19] that the new name was William Miriam
[1:19:21] Branham
[1:19:23] knowing that you're a preacher
[1:19:26] and I'm a preacher
[1:19:29] and so we me and you have to place the
[1:19:32] example
[1:19:36] so me and you must get baptized in the
[1:19:39] name of William Mary Brennan
[1:19:42] brother I opened my eyes tonight
[1:19:45] because he hadn't told me that before
[1:19:47] yeah
[1:19:48] we had started to hear little rumors
[1:19:51] but he had never told me that
[1:19:55] but when he told me face to face
[1:19:59] I told him brother
[1:20:01] I've done a lot of things
[1:20:04] of what I am repented
[1:20:09] but for me to get baptized in the name
[1:20:12] of William Miriam Branham
[1:20:14] I'd rather run
[1:20:17] and I'd rather run
[1:20:20] there's a baptism that I know of yes
[1:20:24] it's the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:20:28] I don't know another name Brothers
[1:20:32] I was baptized in the three names

[1:20:52] today

[1:21:00] the only thing he said is the water is
[1:21:02] warm he didn't say that
[1:21:06] but he said the same thing our brother
[1:21:10] he read the same thing our brother
[1:21:11] Louise
[1:21:13] the only difference was what I told you
[1:21:18] but he explained the baptism in water
[1:21:24] in the matter that I understood it
[1:21:26] marvelously I can tell you this morning
[1:21:30] it was a revelation to me
[1:21:34] and I had a response
[1:21:37] I had a response
[1:21:42] it seemed like I had finished
[1:21:47] this is what the clothes that I had
[1:21:50] I went and got into it
[1:21:53] and I got baptized in the name of the
[1:21:55] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:22:00] I prefer to run away
[1:22:02] and when I say Iran

[1:25:00] small Tabernacle isn't that beautiful
[1:25:04] let's read another scripture
[1:25:07] hey
[1:25:13] we're going to try to advance to where
[1:25:15] the time allows
[1:25:20] we're going to read Amos 3 7. I'm all
[1:25:24] stress name is three seven una is
[1:25:28] a little bit of a difficult uh scripture
[1:25:32] to find foreign
[1:25:57] you have it
[1:25:59] [Applause]
[1:26:01] surely the Lord God will do nothing
[1:26:07] but he revealed his Secrets unto his
[1:26:09] servants the prophets
[1:26:11] [Applause]
[1:26:12] surely the Lord God will do nothing
[1:26:20] but he revealed his Secrets unto his
[1:26:22] servants the prophetske
[1:26:26] did you know Buzz that I looked
[1:26:30] and brother mentions this scripture
[1:26:34] more than 114 times
[1:26:37] and it's beautiful
[1:26:39] it's a beautiful scripture
[1:26:43] you know identify with it
[1:26:49] Believers of this message should
[1:26:51] identify with this scriptures
[1:26:56] but when the scripture becomes a
[1:26:58] revelation to the believer
[1:27:01] we shall do nothing is
[1:27:08] when I say nothing means nothing
[1:27:11] was yes that's how it is
[1:27:15] he says we shall do nothing
[1:27:18] here while Senor surely the Lord God
[1:27:22] until he revealed the secrets
[1:27:26] unto his servants the prophets
[1:27:35] this is a quote that's in Revelations
[1:27:41] and he preaches in the years of the 70s
[1:27:44] in the 12th month in the fourth day this
[1:27:48] is
[1:27:54] The Book of Revelations has more symbols
[1:27:57] or more symbolic things than any other
[1:27:58] book in the Bible
[1:28:00] and we can agree with me
[1:28:06] the Book of Revelations has more symbols
[1:28:09] than other other any other book in the
[1:28:11] Bible
[1:28:13] it has more symbols because it's a
[1:28:15] prophetic book do you believe that
[1:28:19] believe that with all my heart
[1:28:21] they said
[1:28:24] it has more symbols because it's a
[1:28:27] prophetic book es un libero prophetico
[1:28:30] it's a prophetic
[1:28:31] books
[1:28:36] it needs to be understood by a prophetic
[1:28:39] kind
[1:28:40] of Glory to be in his name
[1:28:43] getting us closer amen amen
[1:28:47] it's a prophetic book
[1:28:51] it must be understood
[1:28:54] by prophetic kind
[1:28:57] [Applause]
[1:28:58] this book is not for everyone
[1:29:01] I believe that with all my heart
[1:29:04] when I began in the denomination
[1:29:08] [Applause]
[1:29:28] it's a book that we always want to enter
[1:29:31] Gloria glory be to his name
[1:29:34] this book is not for everyone Cassie no
[1:29:41] there's not too many that can understand
[1:29:44] it
[1:29:46] there's not too many that can understand
[1:29:47] it
[1:29:52] this book is designed for a certain type
[1:29:55] of people
[1:29:57] you said back then he said for a
[1:29:59] prophetic type
[1:30:03] here he says it was only made for a
[1:30:05] certain type of person
[1:30:07] aren't you happy that we're identifying
[1:30:10] right ourselves
[1:30:41] his name
[1:30:43] amen
[1:30:47] this book is made for a certain type of
[1:30:50] people
[1:30:52] Deuteronomy las cosas
[1:30:57] I have a scripture here
[1:31:02] Deuteronomy 29 29
[1:31:06] blessed be the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:31:09] Christ
[1:31:12] foreign Deuteronomy 29 24 organizations
[1:31:17] when the organization sent me to a Bible
[1:31:20] School
[1:31:24] one of the first things they told me to
[1:31:26] do as a homework
[1:31:29] was to learn all the books of the Bible
[1:31:31] by memory
[1:31:33] and they only gave me one week
[1:31:37] said all the books of the Bible
[1:31:40] and you have one week to learn it is
[1:31:46] that's why you're here
[1:31:49] to learn from the Bible
[1:31:54] the first thing that I learned was all
[1:31:56] the books of the Bible
[1:31:59] but ask me now where Joel is
[1:32:02] or where Amis can be found
[1:32:06] brother I struggle to find them
[1:32:10] how many are there 29.29
[1:32:17] says the secret things belong to the
[1:32:19] Lord Our God
[1:32:21] how many believe that this morning
[1:32:26] the secret things belong to the Lord our
[1:32:28] god
[1:32:29] listen to this this is
[1:32:34] but those things which are revealed
[1:32:36] belong unto us
[1:32:52] which they are to us
[1:32:56] and to our children
[1:32:59] forever
[1:33:03] so that we may do all the words of this
[1:33:06] laws
[1:33:08] the
[1:33:25] lost the prophet Prophets
[1:33:40] the secret things belong unto the Lord
[1:33:43] that's correct
[1:33:46] and he revealed it unto us and to our
[1:33:50] children
[1:33:52] in reveals to us are his children
[1:33:55] the hidden things
[1:33:58] the mind
[1:34:13] but those that are lovers of the word of
[1:34:16] God
[1:34:19] that's why the book was written
[1:34:22] for the church
[1:34:26] the revelation of Jesus Christ for the
[1:34:29] church in Ephesus
[1:34:30] the church in Smyrna Iglesia
[1:35:04] it's the last age and don't says the
[1:35:07] numbers
[1:35:09] so glory be to the name of the Lord
[1:35:11] Jesus Christ
[1:35:16] said if the God would ask me when would
[1:35:18] you like to come to this world
[1:35:22] I would have said
[1:35:24] and this time
[1:35:27] and I believe we would also say the same
[1:35:29] things
[1:35:32] well in doubt we would have like to
[1:35:34] really see Jesus who wouldn't like to
[1:35:37] see that
[1:35:39] I would like to live in the times of
[1:35:41] brother Branham
[1:35:43] I was born in 53.
[1:35:48] so he was still preaching but
[1:35:51] I was barely being born when
[1:35:54] I received the message
[1:35:58] the anointed ones in the end time was
[1:36:01] the first message
[1:36:02] after I read through it I read a letter
[1:36:06] to him
[1:36:07] and I sent it off to Jeffersonville res
[1:36:11] 15 days later I received
[1:36:35] you would come here to Phoenix
[1:36:53] [Music]
[1:36:55] and we're asking
[1:36:57] foreign
[1:38:06] so we could see where he was
[1:38:10] where he rested a while
[1:38:13] gory beats his name
[1:38:16] read another scripture with me here
[1:38:23] I have a few more questions
[1:38:30] corinthios
[1:38:42] capitulo
[1:38:45] dos First Corinthians chapter 2
[1:38:53] get him also
[1:38:55] how beautiful
[1:38:56] is
[1:39:00] beautiful that there's brothers and
[1:39:02] sisters that are able to beat us and
[1:39:04] finding the description of the Bible
[1:39:05] glory be to his name
[1:39:07] I like that
[1:39:10] blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:39:13] the scripture I'm going to read you here
[1:39:15] is
[1:39:18] because us as preachers
[1:39:24] there's probably quite a few of you that
[1:39:26] are there in advance
[1:39:29] that can identify with this
[1:39:32] [Music]
[1:39:34] on one occasion the brother said I feel
[1:39:36] like this this morning
[1:39:40] he went he took the pulpit
[1:39:43] I believe I've said this story in the
[1:39:45] past
[1:39:49] if you haven't heard this story
[1:39:54] Brothers God bless you yes I'm shaking
[1:40:00] I'm not sure if it's a fear
[1:40:02] [Music]
[1:40:03] how much bravery How brave I feel
[1:40:08] you
[1:40:10] guys can be the judge
[1:40:14] that's how we arrive to this place
[1:40:16] sometimes
[1:40:17] and the reason for that
[1:40:20] because we're speaking to a special
[1:40:22] people
[1:40:25] we're speaking to the Bride of the Lord
[1:40:27] Jesus Christ
[1:40:29] [Applause]
[1:40:34] they leave their home
[1:40:37] they leave their jobs
[1:40:41] they drive miles and miles
[1:40:45] foreign
[1:40:48] sometimes the enemy of Our Lord comes
[1:40:53] he says what do you drive so far
[1:40:55] why do you got to drive all the way over
[1:40:57] there
[1:40:58] why there's a lot of churches around
[1:41:00] here
[1:41:02] in every corner there's a church
[1:41:05] but remember what we have already read
[1:41:09] this message is for a special people
[1:41:12] foreign
[1:41:17] [Music]
[1:41:20] senor and those results
[1:41:23] so those miles that you're driving is
[1:41:28] that you're sitting there in your car
[1:41:30] Hermano
[1:41:32] God is going to repay you greatly
[1:41:36] blessed be the name of the Lord he said
[1:41:39] and the word says like this is
[1:41:43] a great Apostle Paul
[1:41:45] a great man of God
[1:41:47] I love speaking about him
[1:41:54] brother and when I came to you and came
[1:41:57] with the accidentally speech of wisdom
[1:41:59] no frequent excellencia de palabras or
[1:42:03] the saviduria I did not come with
[1:42:05] Excellency or the speech of wisdom
[1:42:09] the great Apostle Paul saying this is
[1:42:14] remember he was educated
[1:42:19] so I would surpass everybody in my class
[1:42:24] according to the law
[1:42:27] Yer I knew everything
[1:42:45] I said and I came to you not declaring
[1:42:48] into the testimony of God and with him
[1:42:50] crucified
[1:42:53] was Paul identified with Christ
[1:43:01] with Christ I am also crucified
[1:43:05] everybody's hearing reading here
[1:43:11] and I was determined not to know
[1:43:12] anything see
[1:43:17] so among you saved Jesus Christ and him
[1:43:19] crucified
[1:43:21] here it goes Brothers
[1:43:25] and I was with
[1:43:30] and in much trembling
[1:43:34] the reason why
[1:43:37] because he was speaking to his special
[1:43:40] people
[1:43:42] and we also are speaking to a special
[1:43:45] people
[1:43:46] said brother when you come in the
[1:43:48] morning and you take a seat
[1:43:54] and it seems like you're a me and you
[1:43:56] have no meaning
[1:43:58] and let me tell you this morning
[1:44:01] you have a very
[1:44:03] insurmountable value
[1:44:06] being a brother or a sister
[1:44:09] you're a grandfather or grandmother
[1:44:16] you come here every year Wednesday
[1:44:18] Friday and Sunday
[1:44:20] but adios for God hermanosa
[1:44:25] there's a thing that thing has no price
[1:44:31] you come and you sit down you listen to
[1:44:34] the word
[1:44:36] seems like nobody pays attention to you
[1:44:38] no you don't sing no no testifical you
[1:44:42] don't testify
[1:44:44] but you know one thing
[1:44:47] that's your place
[1:44:49] and we should be happy with that we
[1:44:52] should be joyful of that God loves all
[1:44:55] of us God loves all of us
[1:45:02] all things for all of us
[1:45:09] this is
[1:45:13] with you in weakness and in fear in
[1:45:16] which much trembling foreign
[1:45:30] but in demonstrations of the spirit and
[1:45:33] Power
[1:45:35] in this message
[1:45:42] he has to preach and tell the people
[1:45:47] what's happening today in our time
[1:45:54] people want to identify themselves
[1:45:59] they can't find what to identify with
[1:46:04] [Music]
[1:46:07] you see those people going driving down
[1:46:09] the road 85 miles per hour
[1:46:12] when the speed limit says 45
[1:46:17] we suppose that we don't do that
[1:46:23] mentioned something the other day
[1:46:28] although I used to do it
[1:46:30] but when I heard
[1:46:35] I do even more with all my heart
[1:46:38] listen to me brother
[1:46:42] 10
[1:47:12] now we have reached 75 miles per hour
[1:47:16] and they haven't raised it anymore
[1:47:18] maximum
[1:47:24] is the lead limit on the highways
[1:47:27] on the streets it's different
[1:47:32] you find on some roads it's 45 miles per
[1:47:34] hour
[1:47:36] 35 miles per hour
[1:47:40] but in school zones it's only 25.
[1:47:44] what's happening to us in these days
[1:47:48] that everybody wants to be in such a
[1:47:50] rush
[1:47:53] from church I live in Glendale
[1:47:56] and I'm coming here
[1:48:00] there's not one day that that don't
[1:48:02] happen
[1:48:04] the cars always pass me up
[1:48:10] and when they're passing me up they even
[1:48:12] rev their engines
[1:48:13] foreign
[1:48:29] and
[1:48:37] we end up finding ourselves in the same
[1:48:40] place at the red light
[1:48:43] is that what they wanted
[1:48:46] persona it's only to scare somebody
[1:48:49] [Music]
[1:48:52] they didn't Advance too much because
[1:48:54] they're there with me
[1:48:56] that happens to me every single day
[1:48:59] Gloria glory be to his name
[1:49:02] God bless our brothers
[1:49:05] so if you drive over the speed limit
[1:49:08] Hermanos brothers and sisters
[1:49:11] you drive over the speed limit
[1:49:20] if there's a police that's there and
[1:49:22] sometimes they're not very visible
[1:49:24] I drive on the highway
[1:49:27] I drove buses for a lot of years
[1:49:32] this police don't stop in a place where
[1:49:35] you could see them
[1:49:37] you understand what I'm talking about
[1:49:40] they don't stand in a visible place
[1:49:45] when I see a cop in a visible place
[1:49:47] today we saw one and I told my wife
[1:49:52] God bless this policeman
[1:49:55] he's there
[1:49:58] it's only so you could see him again
[1:50:05] they're going to drop their speed limit
[1:50:15] and all of a sudden what you will see is
[1:50:17] the lights
[1:50:19] and your heart begins to want to jump
[1:50:22] out of your chest
[1:50:23] calm down calm down
[1:50:26] he's a policeman
[1:50:29] and he has his lights on
[1:50:32] and he's stopping you
[1:50:35] you look around he's pulling someone
[1:50:37] else over no it's you see
[1:50:42] [Music]
[1:50:50] there are consequences
[1:50:57] see us the drivers
[1:51:01] we drive with a special license
[1:51:05] one time I was on my way to Los Angeles
[1:51:10] and I saw what I was talking about is it
[1:51:14] me it was me
[1:51:17] I had to pull the bus over to one side
[1:51:21] I drove maybe about half a mile because
[1:51:23] there was nowhere to pull over
[1:51:25] because I could see the lights flashing
[1:51:27] I said well it's me there's no doubt
[1:51:28] find out about me he's stopping me
[1:51:32] and when he came and he greeted me
[1:51:35] I responded to his greeting
[1:51:40] and this is the the statement I gave to
[1:51:43] him after greeting each other
[1:51:47] and here was my
[1:51:49] records in tickets driving without a
[1:51:52] ticket for many years
[1:51:55] and he heard me
[1:51:58] [Music]
[1:52:06] it was a little strange it didn't take
[1:52:08] very long he came back to me
[1:52:11] he said
[1:52:13] Mr your record Remains the Same
[1:52:18] I only stopped you what
[1:52:21] is
[1:52:23] because you were kind of hitting the the
[1:52:26] barrier line on the right side of the
[1:52:27] road and I was right behind him
[1:52:31] and I saw you hitting the white line on
[1:52:35] the highway for a while
[1:52:37] that's the reason why
[1:52:40] foreign
[1:53:30] they're trying to find something to
[1:53:32] identify with
[1:53:35] the reason why they're doing this is
[1:53:39] because there's something in them
[1:53:42] God made for them but
[1:53:46] God made an example
[1:53:50] so in other words they're looking for an
[1:53:52] example
[1:53:53] the people outside
[1:53:56] are looking for an example
[1:53:59] and we should also take care of
[1:54:01] ourselves
[1:54:04] if we're not careful we'll also start
[1:54:06] looking for an example outside in the
[1:54:08] world
[1:54:10] but the reality our example is here
[1:54:12] Gloria glory be to his name his name is
[1:54:15] Jesus
[1:54:16] and his name is William Branham
[1:54:20] because brother Branham
[1:54:23] preach to us a message he
[1:54:26] is awesome and if there's someone that
[1:54:27] followed Jesus it was him
[1:54:32] when they confused him with the Lord
[1:54:34] Jesus Christ he said
[1:54:38] I'm going to close everything down
[1:54:42] I'm going to cancel all my trips tours
[1:54:46] I'm going to go up to the
[1:54:48] mountains
[1:54:51] and perhaps you may hear an accident
[1:54:53] happen to him
[1:54:55] he said he was preparing to take his own
[1:54:58] life
[1:55:02] he said taking away from the Lord Jesus
[1:55:05] Christ
[1:55:06] what belongs only to him
[1:55:10] I can't do that
[1:55:13] I am a sinner
[1:55:16] I was born
[1:55:18] yo yo yo yo
[1:55:22] he says me I mentioned three or four
[1:55:24] times
[1:55:27] how can I take away that glory and that
[1:55:29] honor come on
[1:55:33] to that extreme
[1:55:34] Williams
[1:55:41] baptizing in the name of William Branham
[1:55:43] foreign
[1:56:04] [Music]
[1:56:16] oh but God made an example
[1:56:20] that we can identify with him
[1:56:23] that example that God made yes
[1:56:26] and that's when God
[1:56:28] when God made Jesus Christ
[1:56:32] to be our savior
[1:56:35] that's the example
[1:56:43] Jesus they should identify with Jesus
[1:56:45] Christ
[1:56:48] and they should uh desire to be the way
[1:56:50] he is
[1:56:52] somebody desire this morning to be like
[1:56:55] Christ
[1:56:56] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:57:00] that is identifying ourselves with him
[1:57:04] in the Old Testament
[1:57:08] I want to read another scripture
[1:57:14] leviticos Uno cuatro Leviticus 1 4.

[1:58:08] and it shall be accepted for him to make
[1:58:11] atonement for him
[1:58:13] once again
[1:58:18] and he shall place his hands upon the
[1:58:20] head of the burnt offering
[1:58:30] in the Old Testament
[1:58:34] and when a man wanted to identify in
[1:58:36] God's house

[1:58:52] how many knew that
[1:58:55] the lamb is the most innocent of all the
[1:58:58] animals
