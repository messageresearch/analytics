to guide us we have a little small uh thought and again we just pray that it be beneficial for you just want to encourage you to have fellowship around the world i think we we have forgotten what the family alter is how many have forgotten it you know we don't we don't we don't hear it as much anymore so just i just want to bring it simply because that's all i got i think it's important for us parents and very important for our youth to gather around the congregate and to share the word and just simply share our thoughts about the word the thing that brings unity to the family i think that brings unity to the church and that's all we want yes so don't forget to pray for me for me and um let us bow our heads please lord jesus we just want to step aside this evening and when you take control lord jesus of the service father lord we're nothing father but with you we're everything lord jesus lord we just need you in our lives we need you in this home of ours for jesus in this physical body we need you lord jesus and in the hole where our parents and our siblings live lord [Music] i just want to testify of the family altar lord yesterday or just how it's it made an impact in our lives lord [Music] lord jesus senor jesus we're just so thankful for you lord jesus lord we humbly ask you lord jesus that these few words that i'm going to say lord question maybe a blessing father for our brothers and sisters we just want to be simple father we want to accept your word lord jesus we give you all the honor and the glory gloria in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen please open your scriptures to joshua chapter two see and we'll we'll be reading a few uh scriptures but uh if we stand at school you know for the pledge you know we we should be standing for the word as well now therefore i i pray you swear unto me by the lord since i have showed you kindness that ye will also show kindness out to my father's house and give me a true token and that he will save a life my father and my mother and my brethren and my sisters and all that they have delivered our lives from death alvarez hermanos hermanas and she's asking for her parents yes and i believe each and each youth here you guys have the authority to ask for your parents as well verse 14 and the man answered her our lives for yours if ye utter not this our business and it shall be when the lord has given us the land that we will deal kindly and truly with thee respond then she let them down by a cord through the window for her house was upon the town wall and she dwelled upon the wall entonces casa estaba and she said unto them get you to the mountains least the pursuers meet you and hide yourselves there are three days until the pursuers be returned and afterward may ye go your way foreign and the man said unto her we will be blameless of this stein oath which thou has made us swear on behold when we come into the land thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which out that is let us down by and thou shall bring thy father and thy mother and thy brethren and all thy fathers household household home unto thee and it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will be guiltless and whosoever shall be with thee in the house his blood shall be on our head if any hand be upon him foreign and if thou utter this our business then we will be quick of thine oath which thou has made us to swear and she sent them away and they departed and she bound the scarlet line in the window you may be seated you know this is a a beautiful beautiful story i i don't know about you but i identify with rahab identification and it's made a big impact in my life you know to realize what god could do on somebody like her the realization and that's exactly what he did with me yes um so i just want to get a little point across no mosquito destiny you know just pretty much bring it as a testimony of a family altar how many can you know i want to open my heart with you guys i i just want to bring it so simple i wish we could be together at the hall with the youth because that's where i feel more comfortable um but i just want to be honest with you guys i want to be open and and maybe you guys could be honest with yourselves and i i want to ask you a question how many can you say that you that that we may wasted most of our our time on worldly things he wants the vision he wants separation he wants death between us and and i think that he's doing a good job but we are overcomers pero nosotros is you know it's been a big burden realizing that i had been misplacing or misleading my family you know wasting our times on watching tv how many watch tv okay i guess now everybody has tv praise you know we watch movies we waste our time watching those short videos on youtube videos on youtube uh maybe maybe we don't maybe we're not watching nothing bad but we are wasting our time we are not giving the lord his time you know there's there's there's so many things that there's been distractions in our lives and it's misleading our our youth and our children you know i it has been a burden in my heart the school systems you know they're they're molding our our youth and our children they have the power to mold our children and our youth or even in the colleges you know they're they have they have they have us for 40 hours a week and they're feeding us whatever they want to feed us and it scares me to to realize that that's what's happening to my children and i and it makes me feel like i'm a failure as a pastor to my home center now i'm being open with you guys this evening you know it's it's those living testimonies testimonials of of other brethren like us that we go visit their homes and and then it hurts when we don't see a tv on the wall or it hurts us that their kids are praying much better so i seen all these testimonies testimonials all these brothers you know it's encouraged me to make a decision in my home tiempo and have family alter with their parents you know there's a lot of division between dad and mom and and and the children and the youth mother but the word could bring us together you know so we we started to do family altar comments and by all means i i'm not saying we're perfect we don't do it every day but we're doing our best to to make that happen just just so you can have a little uh idea of what a family altar is or how we do it at home you know we we choose a message together and um and we listen for 30 minutes or an hour yes sometimes less menos and i usually ask one of the children to pray regularly so you know we pray we listen to the tape or ramos and and then we all have our little notebooks and at the end of the message we all voice our opinion of what we learned and and you know god has come down on the scene no it might see something simple but god has come down in our in our living room you know and it's i think our children need to see that more often on our youth you know where we get so used to yeah just to come to church iglesia but then we don't even pray together at home can't even talk about god at our homes and that's scary yes at this one time on our family altar family you know we're listening to a message and and god is clearly talking to me idiot and you know i'm at the point of of breaking down yes and and my my son turns around out of nowhere and he says god is talking to you you know how how beautiful that is to have the unity around the world already he was wondering because we we heard about the gifts and and he heard in the tape you know that we all have a gift and the very next day at sunday school you know his questions was answered and and the these kids my kids are always telling me you know they're talking to me about the message you know we we go out with a family salimos con una famiglia and and sometimes you know they see that things are wrong and and they call it out and and sometimes it's like oh be quiet don't say that too loud because we don't want them to hurt anybody uh but i i feel that we're identified with rahab because she had done the same thing with her family she applied the token to her home [Music] now she if we listen to the message you know brother branham says that it was two tape boys you know that's what we're doing today we're applying the tape to to our homes applicants slipped in somewhere for the predestinated seed they slipped over to her her house and play some tapes she made her house a church to service the message to receive the message you know how that for me that speaks so loud we have to make the altar it is so important to play the messages at our house it has to be playing day in and day out we want them to penetrate the walls to the deepest room talking about our physical home physical and i'm talking about our physical being you know um this shows us that rahab received the messenger yes and the message of her time and that is exactly what we should be doing we need to accept the message and the messenger this is um on the token his messenger had preached joshua when he said that don't touch that house or anything in it [Music] oh it's served for the lord amen a gentile a harlot street walker a man but she heard and believed and she applied the token no matter how stooped you are in sin no importa what you have done que esecho that doesn't have one thing to do with it you apply the token to application it's for you espera if you feel in your heart there's something tugging you know it don't matter what condition you're in portland you can apply the token you know we there's nobody no i nadian that cannot receive the token you know what is the token we are we are taught that the token is the holy ghost you know and we know the prescription for the holy ghost says repent and be baptized for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for their promises is for you and your children and for all who are far off and who the lord shall call yeah amen isn't that beautiful we have the token today you know we we have to apply the token to our lives you know in moses you know the sign was the blood but there was no life in that blood it was just a foreshadow of what it is today and that's the lord jesus christ this blood is the one that could save us and the token is the single ghost es el espirito santo what do we do when we apply the token to our home what do we do when we apply the token to our home says if you want to read another one acts 16 31. paul told the centurion now you've seen the god of heaven perform a miracle just before judgment you believe it yes what can i do he said rise and be baptized and thou and thy house shall be saved believe what believe the lord jesus christ for your house apply the token to your house then what do you do when you apply it to your house i think the ques the this question our youth have been asking you know we already got baptized what's next we gave our life to the lord jesus christ what's next i raised my hands at the altar what's next do you guys have that question i know i have that question you'll see this is what brother branham says yes move all the trash out sakato lava listen here he got baptized and brother ben is telling them move all the trash out of him get all the short skirts sakato and what whatever more equal and kick them out the door is affordable you're going to apply the token won't stand still for it won't stand still for it yes sir that is all that that it that it all out all the dances and the parties and fiestas and the rock and roll rock and roll and old vulgar newspapers and the stuff that's out of if you really want the token it's time to do some spring cleaning to start cleaning our house is time to grab our mops start getting everything out you know how many months we have here tonight i know that you guys clean well yo this is how we have to clean like our moms mothers we just make sure we get everything out of our lives all these worldly things to receive the token like jacob did a second issue he said and he said he told his wife put away them gods put away them gods take those gods out amen you know what joshua said for crossing over he said wash your clothes come not come not at your wives and so forth and get ready amen get ready apply it believe it clean up olympian let your children die your family this is the prescription of how to apply the token i'll ask you again do you guys want to apply the token this evening you guys want to clean up your homes this is all it takes sometimes we make it too complicated we gotta do this we gotta do that step after step after step let's just clean our lives let's take out all these worldly things out of our lives so he could enter in puerto it says his messenger turned back and said i have obeyed your orders we found a woman that believed in controversy and we told her that all that would come under the red sign back there the token person it would signal to destroy the whole the whole thing went right straight up and rehab and all her people said right he told us and they didn't have to look out the window they could read the scripture while the battle was going on no matter what what word is it the word of this of this hour i'm going to read you a a a testimony let's testify it says uh greetings in the name of the lord jesus christ saludos in the hombre del senor christo we are writing this testimony from ukraine first of all we want to thank everyone my sister and i are in the dorms of our university where two or three are gathered together in my name there i am the bible says in matthew 18 20. and while explosions and gun volleys rumbled outside outside the window my sister and i hit the play button and if i were asked what was the best time of my life i would say with one hundred percent certainty that it is now we clearly hear him answering us in these sermons i am glad that in such a terrible situation when people are trembling with fear and panic foreign quotes from brother branham tapes sintas menzakis de nostromano branham christian hymns like onward christian soldier cantando in jesus name and many others come to our minds i am glad that god sent us this test for he tests all his children he wants to appear on the last day amongst the victors those who have withstood god's test and kept the faith there is a martial law in the city i lay and i and i see that so when the siren sounds everyone has to go down to the bomb shelters but honestly it's very disturbing there are a lot of people there ai muncha except for me and my sister except there are not enough things to stay there comfortably many make noise curse and behave badly asenrido imalicen in addition there is poor communication and no internet departed running out and i remembered what i had been taught since i was a little girl recorded my parents had taught me to look for answers in god's word mr and peace and inspiration came to my heart to stay inspiration we had a wonderful night in the room the lord gave us a good and sound sleep and she replied that it would remind her of the harlot rahab responded it gave me confidence that we are perfectly safe as long as the message is heard in our room a little later god confirmed it again a little later god confirmed it again and the sermon the patriarch abraham and el salman el patriarca abram this is a testimony from two young ladies is a testimonial in ukraine and ukraine where they couldn't have any shelter with peace and they decided to stay in the room they weren't allowed to stay in the room but they decided to stay there because that's the only place they could push play perez i believe yo crayon that that's what we should be doing today we should be listening to the tapes day in and day out it sounds like i repeat myself all the time but there's no greater thing than to listen to the hour to the message of this hour ray have accepted that message hour for her time she made a family altar familiar that and she was saved that's what we have to do what's going on in the world we have to have the confidence in this message it has to be everything for us i don't know what else to tell you we always have to be listening to the tape siempre tenemos it says and then you people that listen to this on tape for to quit fussing with one another believe the message of the bible believe jesus christ and love and honor yeah and respect one another men respect your wives you respect your home bring your home together because you you re remember this land was for the home not just one record the whole home the tot we should love each other and believers should separate themselves from the world they were not just yet come together to talk about the message i would like to encourage you to listen to this message of the hour there is nothing greater under the sun besides this message we have to listen the musicians would come forward siapo and vanilos musicos it is my heart desire to be under the token with all of you yes my desire is for all of us to have our lord jesus christ in our hearts of christ it is a burden to see es um how sad it is to see an eagle caged the que tantriste let's not just
