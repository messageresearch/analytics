very grateful with god that he still has my mother with life i know he's [Music] [Music] we're going to continue with our talk that we were going to have this morning [Music] the second message of putting all things in balance and as a subtitle i want to call it christian balance danielle [Music] [Music] in are found wanting hey man just as you are let's power our heads let's draw close to the author of the word celestial our lord heavenly father and father we know that you sent a prophet in these last days [Music] so that he can help us in our lives help every one of us that is here in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen brothers you may be seated whenever i'm very grateful with the lord that i have a pastor that's a friend and i can trust him in my man amen we're going to continue with our with our talk that we left off last time which is called putting all things in balance in the book of january we find that there was a prophet that they were taken out or they were kidnapped from their own land and they were taken to babylon he had dreams and or rather he had dreams but he couldn't remember the dreams and he wanted someone to come to him and give him the interpretation of so they would say to him king no one can tell you a dream that you forgot but there was only one prophet there in the land and the word of the lord comes to the prophet amen we're going to go over some definitions that we spoke on last time the word balance is it's an even distribution of weight enabling someone or something to remain upright and steady in a condition like it's a condition in which different elements are equal or in the correct proportions it's the stability of one's mind or feelings now we're going to speak of the words that are synonymous so these are words that can take the place or substitute the word balance which is steadiness now words that are have the opposite meaning equilibrium of the word balance is uneven disunity violence violence disorder confusion confusion disconnection and disconnectedness now just by looking at the definitions in equilibrium so we can see how important it is to put all things in balance because if we ourselves are not in balance then we get very confused last time we saw that the scale is god's word when something comes close to you or something comes in your everyday life he says put it on the scale of the word so we can see if it's something that's from god or no is it or if it's not from god amen amen that's why many times we see that we're missing the target the situation is very confusing because we didn't put those things in the balance of the word let's read a quote from the brought up from the prophet estoya sombrado en este dia preta brandon says i'm astounded in this day christianas and have always been when people profess to be christians economic and then the first little trial comes on for el camino the the prophet says they fall by the wayside so that's very tremendous it's in other words it's not the greatest trial but it's a very little trial enos then we fall by the wayside because we lost our balance when for example when a person gets baptized in the baptismal waters they should then search for the holy ghost because when someone is baptized in waters that person is yet not ready he says it goes to show that it was just an intellectual conception of christ he says that's the reason so many doesn't hold out today to and we're accepting the person of christ [Music] he says justification is what you believe and you that don't believe that the holy ghost is a person he is a personal pronoun we accept what oh i you need a personality some characteristics which are shaping the character when we accept the person of the holy ghost is a personality you have like the brother lord forgive them for they know not what they do amen amen the water just glides off its skin amen amen we're in this christian walk and there's so many things in our everyday life in osaka del camino that makes us go by the wayside and we just want to walk and serve the lord but then there are things of our lives in equilibrium that we don't put them in balance the last time that i was here i told you examinance to examine yourselves to study your own selves how many of you can say amen you study me and i still don't even know myself any any kind of people from any kind of life come to this place amen amen how is it that we use our time el tiempo mesa foreign time does it get at me does it get me out of balance tiempo do i have time the prophet says he said jesus had just been turned down from a great revival el siempre estaba el he was always about the father's business amen amen what is the the father's business the prophet says i like that he said nosotros i foolishly use who people were always talking he was uh they were always staying outside of his house and the prophet says i have so much time and when i know when i say i don't and the scale was going up and down and the doctor tells them billy i don't know how you're alive right now and the prophet says i myself i have so much time every time we get a chance to put in a plug for jesus do because time is precious to see argo pala iglesia to do something for the church to help the people of the church i have so much time let me now go to the church let me sweep the churches because we don't know how to manage our time so my question is where do you put god there's some times that we lose our balance because we don't even where to place god sometimes we don't even know where we left him amen and he said david said david said i placed the lord always before me that i shall not be moved [Music] carner reposera en esperanza my flesh shall rest in hope yes sir because i know he will not leave my soul in hell neither will he suffer his holy one to see corruption so when we ever find ourselves in an issue the lord will not leave us there in that issue but what we have to do is place god before us put him in first place because the problems will come and sometimes we feel that our problems are a living hello it feels like a living because david said for the lord is always before me so there is the key no it's not the land of me he's before if a guy calls you a holy rollerco plays god between you and him if the wife gets angry with you i'll say that part again [Music] i'll repeat it again so it'd be the third time which is perfection if the wife gets angry with you place if the children aggravate you whatever you do if papa and mama gives you a little spanking and corrects you please remember what god said about that created put but in third place is the first stage of insanity heard that the prophet says maybe that's why people say no wonder i'm insane now there's two kinds of insanity one that is of the devil and there's another one that is from god people that are going crazy because but then there are people that can also have the mind of the devil himself temper is the first stage of insanity sometimes we're driving to our job and and the gas is almost costing six dollars and now your day is you begin that way you can lose your balance sometimes your feelings get hurt and sometimes you say well no one uh cares about me no one worries for me not even me no one talks to me diablo that's just the devil important telling that you don't matter to anyone in check with the word of god in proverbs that ruleth his spirit then he that taketh the city here in proverbs it's telling us this is the one that isn't easily angered it's better he says that a man that has muscles so big they're about to tear off his shirt a person that can contain themselves i just easily is is because we don't have the mind of christmas he's better than a person that can take over a city you have the rifle the bible but the message is the scope to hit the target so you have the bible it is they [Applause] his memory would go bad then a spirit starts to come now this is a question if you say to this mountain you can have what you're getting spiritual amnesia now the prophet says and he says and you forget christian you lose your christian balance christian we're talking about christian balance and if you forget you lose your christian balance now the problems that come in our lives in our marriage at work in our money and in our health and all the problems it will scale things out here are the problems because we're now knowing and recognizing that he will take us out of the problem god's word is the reason why we're still standing if it wasn't for god's word we would have already tipped over that's why the prophet said that so many that profess to be christians they're now by the wayside because they didn't put everything will come in its place amen hey because we have spiritual amnesia you say that the word is not for me it is for you brother sister it's for you don't deny the word the prophet says when you begin to forget the word the prophet says watch out you're losing your balance that may mean that the disease sign is showing on you que tienes algo de amnesia es spirituan that you've got some spiritual amnesia amount of random vision spiritual brother branham says in the message spiritual amnesia in paragraph 41. i don't have it on the on the slideshow the prophet is a way that we can have uh spiritual amnesia escondos opinion is when you're in between two different opinions this is when you're in between two different opinions he says you're right at the door then of receiving spiritual amnesia familia do you have the opinion that comes from the family then the opinion of my brother and then from my mother's family but now you the prophet says when you're in between two different opinions is [Music] not long ago there was a great sum of money that was given me buchus [Music] many of you heard about it and i refused to look at it i could have made all of you happy just pick through among us a million five hundred thousand dollars if someone could be rich here on the earth can be a millionaire in my opinion william brandon it was william branham but he never an article of it in the paper but i didn't want it it isn't money this is a man that gets his mind on money now we're talking about balance we have to keep our balance and the devil always wants to get us out of balance and he uses three things to get the ministry out of balance he's on the outside then i'm on the outside there are three things that i've noticed in reading history that wrecks the minister's life from the start and the next is women yes that's right man takes money las mujeres women popularity essence that's so there's three things but there are other things that go along with it but the major the main thing but the main thing is when god begins to bless a brother and gives them something a little more than or something another to help the people then the man begins to think how many believe the prophet has the correct prescription a good doctor he examines he says you want me to tell you how to get up he says get down get down get down el camino has he says the way up is go down he that humbles himself he that exhausts himself will be made a beast so the devil always wants us to get out of the way to get us out of balance but we always have to put god in first place we have to put god in first place if you can please stand we're now closing now going back to the book of daniel the king nebuchadnezzar he had dreams he says if someone can tell me my dreams that i can't even remember he says then i will raise him up the bible says that king nebuchadnezzar gave the name balthasar to uh so he gave daniel the name of the god of the king he made a golden image of his god who was the god of king nebuchadnezzar is it and they took them and the bible smell the bible says that they didn't even smell like they were burned so then the king said now that was the beginning of the dispensation of the gentiles the prophet said it started supernatural and he says that the dream that he saw there was a very big tree in the chapter and the animals would rest in the shade of the tree and then a voice from heaven said such in the tree [Applause] he then went to the mountains and he would eat the grass of the beasts of the ox of the field the weeds from an ocean and and he said that his hair grew throughout his body like the feathers of an ego yes and then there was a heart of a beast that that came in him that was amnesia because he forgot he was a king he forgot that he was a human being and he thought he was an animal the king came back to his senses and it says at the end of the day i never considered lifted my eyes onto heaven and my understanding is an everlasting dominion and his kingdom is from generation to generation and all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing and he doeth according to his will in in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth now notice nebuchadnezzar's revelations and none can stay his hand and say unto him no one can tell god what are you doing lord what are you doing my problem what we have since we know in the name of the lord jesus christ amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] right [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i [Music] [Music] my you are [Music] oh [Music]
