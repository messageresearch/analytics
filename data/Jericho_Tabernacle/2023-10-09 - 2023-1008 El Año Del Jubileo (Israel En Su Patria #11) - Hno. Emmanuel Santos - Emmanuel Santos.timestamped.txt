[46:27] [Music]
[46:30] we're going to go to the book of
[46:32] Hosea uh chapter
[46:35] 6 and we're going to start with verse
[46:43] [Music]
[46:47] one hose is between the Book of Daniel
[46:50] and the Book of
[46:53] [Music]
[46:54] Joel you can say say Amen when you have
[46:58] it the word of the Lord
[47:12] says come and let us return unto the
[47:15] Lord for he hath torn and he healed us
[47:18] he hath smitten and he bind us
[47:24] up
[47:27] after two days will he revive us in the
[47:29] third day he will raise us up and we
[47:31] shall live in his
[47:44] sight then shall we know if we follow on
[47:47] to know the Lord his going forth is
[47:50] prepared as the morning and he shall
[47:52] come unto us as the rain as the latter
[47:54] and former rain unto the
[47:56] [Music]
[47:58] Earth may the Lord bless the reading of
[48:00] his word you may be
[48:02] [Music]
[48:13] seated it's something rather
[48:17] funny Marcos and I have the same suit
[48:24] onday so I believe we have the same
[48:26] Spirit from
[48:28] yesterday that on at the wedding we had
[48:30] on the same
[48:32] suit so we decided to do the same thing
[48:34] this
[48:37] morning so now right here in
[48:42] Hosea it speaks that there's a group of
[48:45] people they're going to go back to the
[48:50] Lord they'll have a former and a latter
[48:54] rain
[48:56] last time we spoke on the former and
[48:58] latter
[48:59] rain but for the
[49:03] Gentiles but this former and latter
[49:05] rign this for the
[49:09] Jews brother brandom says in the
[49:12] message recognizing your day and its
[49:16] message now notice
[49:18] carefully that after two
[49:23] days now that didn't mean 2 24-hour
[49:29] days cuz there's been that's happened
[49:31] way back
[49:33] Yonder many hundreds of years
[49:37] ago see it meant two days with the
[49:40] Lord after 2,000
[49:44] years now you know how long it's been
[49:46] since that
[49:49] time it's been 2700
[49:54] years
[49:59] since that because here in Hosea it's BC
[50:05] 780
[50:10] 1964 you see it's been something over
[50:12] 2700 years
[50:16] ago he said after two days in the third
[50:20] day he will revive us
[50:23] again and give us light in his
[50:27] sight there's where the trumpets coming
[50:31] in that's the hour that we're
[50:34] living the day that we're
[50:38] living now they've been
[50:40] scattered
[50:42] blinded
[50:46] gathered and are far into the third
[50:51] day you see it they were scattered from
[50:53] Palestine to the whole world
[50:56] they were
[50:57] blinded to reject the
[51:02] Messiah and now they've been gathered in
[51:04] their
[51:06] Homeland ready for the
[51:09] trumpets to recognize the
[51:12] atonement so this prophecy of
[51:15] Hosea it speaks about how it is that the
[51:19] Jews they were in different nations of
[51:21] the
[51:23] earth they were spread around different
[51:25] parts of the
[51:26] world because 2,000 years
[51:30] ago when Jesus Christ the Messiah came
[51:33] they were blinded and they rejected
[51:37] him and the punishment of
[51:41] that they were expelled out of their
[51:44] promised
[51:45] land they were expelled out of their
[51:50] Homeland the Bible says that the Jewish
[51:53] people it's God's people
[51:57] so then God in his
[52:00] grace being that they rejected
[52:04] Christ there's no way to have
[52:07] access to the baptism of the Holy
[52:12] Ghost but God is still trying to return
[52:14] them back to their
[52:17] Homeland so that once in their
[52:19] Homeland they're in the promised
[52:23] land God can finally reveal himself to
[52:26] them the same applies to every one of us
[52:30] here if you're not in the right
[52:33] position in the promised land in
[52:37] Christ God will bring you
[52:40] back so that then finally he can reveal
[52:42] himself unto
[52:44] you a good example of this
[52:47] isth is in the story of
[52:50] ruthu in Ruth
[52:54] 1
[53:05] now it came to pass in the days when the
[53:06] judges ruled that there was a famine in
[53:08] the land and a certain man of Bethlehem
[53:10] Judah went to sojourn in the country of
[53:12] Moab he and his wife and his two
[53:24] sons
[53:29] and the name of the man was AMC and the
[53:32] name of his wife Naomi and the name of
[53:34] his two sons was mean and chilon ephra
[53:38] of the Bethlehem Judah and they came
[53:40] into the country of Moab and continued
[53:44] there now remember when the Jews 2,000
[53:46] years
[53:47] ago they rejected their
[53:50] Messiah the
[53:52] gospel it started to go from the Jews
[53:55] unto the
[53:57] Gentiles now here we have Naomi and her
[54:03] family leaving the promised
[54:05] land and they go into a gentile
[54:09] Nation brother brand says the message
[54:11] why little
[54:15] Bethlehem Naomi representing the
[54:17] Orthodox
[54:19] Church was went on the account of
[54:23] famine entered into the land of
[54:27] Moab like the scattering of
[54:30] Israel all out among all the
[54:34] nations and as she came back she brought
[54:38] back Ruth the
[54:42] moabit and she returned just in barley
[54:47] season just the Gathering in of the
[54:50] first
[54:54] barley
[54:56] that is the Gentile Church coming to God
[54:58] just barely at The Barley season
[55:01] again so then at the same
[55:04] time when the Jews go back to their
[55:07] Homeland the
[55:09] Gentiles that had been
[55:13] scattered from the original
[55:16] word that was brought in the
[55:20] beginning they're also being restored
[55:23] unto their Homeland but our homeland
[55:27] first of all it
[55:28] is is to be in Christ
[55:34] Jesus now
[55:37] Naomi it says in Ruth
[55:41] 13 now just observe what God needed to
[55:44] do for Naomi to come
[55:47] back verse three
[55:53] says and
[55:55] ELC Naomi's husband died and she was
[55:58] left and her two
[56:07] sons and they took them wives of the
[56:09] woman of Moab and the names of one was
[56:12] orpa and the names of the other Ruth and
[56:13] they dwelt there for about 10
[56:17] years now notice it was for 10
[56:23] years
[56:27] and mean and chilon died also both of
[56:30] them and the woman was left of her and
[56:33] the woman was left of her two sons and
[56:35] her
[56:36] husband now
[56:38] Naomi she's of the tribe of
[56:42] Juda now in the Old
[56:45] Testament when Solomon was
[56:50] alive when Solomon had a sin that he
[56:53] committed
[56:57] he fell in love with women that were not
[56:59] of his
[57:01] homeland he fell in love with many Pagan
[57:05] women God told him to be
[57:07] careful because those
[57:10] women would cause for his heart to get
[57:14] distant from
[57:15] God and that's what happened because of
[57:20] that God punished
[57:23] Solomon by SP in the Kingdom of
[57:28] Israel I believe brother also spoke of
[57:31] this when he spoke on the Kings of
[57:34] Israel one kingdom was the kingdom of
[57:36] the
[57:37] north it had 10
[57:39] tribes now these were 10
[57:43] tribes Naomi was in Moab for 10 years
[57:47] then the second kingdom was the kingdom
[57:49] of the South that had two
[57:53] tribes
[57:55] the Bible says in First Kings
[58:08] 11:11 wherefore the Lord said unto
[58:10] Solomon for as much as this is done of
[58:13] thee and thou Hast not kept my Covenant
[58:15] and my statutes which I have commanded
[58:17] Thee I will surely Ren the Kingdom from
[58:19] thee and will give it to thy
[58:23] servant
[58:27] not withstanding in thy days I will not
[58:30] do it for David thy father's sake but I
[58:32] will Rend it out at the hand of thy
[58:43] son how be it I will not Rend away all
[58:45] the kingdom but I will give One Tribe of
[58:48] to thy son for David my servant's sake
[58:51] and for Jerusalem's sake which I have
[58:53] chosen
[58:55] now verses later down into in
[59:11] 29 and it came to pass that at the time
[59:13] when jeroboam went out to Jerusalem that
[59:16] the prophet aijah and shilonite found
[59:19] him in the way and he had and he had
[59:22] clad himself with a new garment and they
[59:24] two were alone in the
[59:30] field and aajan caught the new garment
[59:33] that was on him and rent it in 12
[59:47] pieces and he said to jeroboam take thee
[59:50] 10 pieces for thus sayith the Lord the
[59:52] god of Israel behold I will Ren the
[59:54] Kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and
[59:56] will give 10 tribes to
[1:00:06] thee but he shall have one tribe for my
[1:00:08] servant David's sake and for and for
[1:00:10] Jerusalem's sake the city that I have
[1:00:12] chosen out of all the tribes of
[1:00:16] Israel now 10 were for a certain
[1:00:20] Kingdom and one tribe was given to David
[1:00:23] so these were two
[1:00:25] it was
[1:00:26] David that was the tribe of
[1:00:29] Judah and the other tribe that was given
[1:00:31] to
[1:00:33] him brother brandham says in the message
[1:00:36] the
[1:00:39] countdown notice the natural man even
[1:00:42] counts
[1:00:45] backwards I said he did things
[1:00:48] backwards he counts
[1:00:51] backwards watch his
[1:00:53] count
[1:00:57] 10
[1:01:02] 9876543210 you you see he goes
[1:01:04] back and starts
[1:01:10] counting he's all 10 is a bad number
[1:01:13] that's
[1:01:15] right to start with 10 it's a bad
[1:01:20] number they had 10 tribes of
[1:01:23] Israel
[1:01:26] and them was just all
[1:01:30] carnal so then the kingdom of the north
[1:01:32] that had the 10
[1:01:35] tribes that was the carnal part of
[1:01:39] Israel Naomi going to Moab for 10
[1:01:44] years she lived a carnal life for 10
[1:01:48] years she came out of the promised
[1:01:51] land because God can only bless you
[1:01:55] with his spirit in the promised
[1:02:03] land so then the the kingdom of the
[1:02:06] South it was Judah and there was another
[1:02:10] tribe let's see what that other tribe
[1:02:13] is in First Kings
[1:02:23] 12:20
[1:02:30] and it came to pass when all Israel
[1:02:32] heard that jeroboam was come again that
[1:02:34] they sent and called him unto the
[1:02:36] congregation and made him King over all
[1:02:38] of Israel there was none that followed
[1:02:41] the House of David but the tribe of
[1:02:42] Judah
[1:02:45] only so jeroboam was the king of the
[1:02:48] king of the kingdom of the
[1:02:50] north now in verse
[1:02:53] 21 it's it speaks of another
[1:02:56] man that will be the King of the
[1:03:05] South and when reob rooam was come to
[1:03:09] Jerusalem he assembled all the house of
[1:03:11] Judah with the Tribe of
[1:03:16] Benjamin so the tribe that was added
[1:03:19] unto the House of David to the tribe of
[1:03:22] Judah that was the Tribe of
[1:03:28] Benjamin now these aren't just
[1:03:30] scriptures of the
[1:03:32] past this also applies for
[1:03:36] today now remember when Naomi left the
[1:03:39] promised
[1:03:41] land she left as a backsliding
[1:03:44] woman she left the promised
[1:03:47] land just like Israel as a nation she
[1:03:52] backslid because they were blind
[1:03:56] to not accept the
[1:03:58] Messiah so then the
[1:04:01] gospel could go first from the
[1:04:04] Jews unto us the
[1:04:11] Gentiles now in Zechariah
[1:04:23] 137
[1:04:28] awake oh sword against my shepherd and
[1:04:30] against the man that is my fellow sayith
[1:04:32] the Lord of hosts Smite the shepherd and
[1:04:35] the Sheep shall be scattered and I will
[1:04:37] turn my hand upon the little ones do
[1:04:40] this
[1:04:40] say it says if you attack the pastor the
[1:04:45] shepherd the Sheep will be
[1:04:48] dispersed in John 10:14 it
[1:04:51] says Jesus himself speaking
[1:04:56] I am the Good
[1:04:58] Shepherd and I know my
[1:05:01] sheep and I am known of
[1:05:05] mine even as the father knoweth
[1:05:08] me and I know the
[1:05:11] father I Lay My Life down for the
[1:05:15] sheep and other sheep have
[1:05:18] I which are not of this
[1:05:21] F them also must I bring
[1:05:24] they'll hear my voice there shall be one
[1:05:27] F and one
[1:05:33] Shepherd so Naomi leaving the promised
[1:05:37] land in a backsliding condition then
[1:05:40] goes to
[1:05:41] Moab was with the
[1:05:44] intention to find to get
[1:05:48] Ruth to bring her back to the promised
[1:05:53] land
[1:05:55] now remember Judah and Benjamin they're
[1:05:58] connected so when the the gospel left
[1:06:00] the
[1:06:02] Jews and was in transition of going from
[1:06:05] the Jews to the
[1:06:06] Gentiles the seven Church ages
[1:06:09] began and the first messenger it was
[1:06:13] Paul
[1:06:15] Paul is of The Tribe of
[1:06:19] Benjamin in Romans
[1:06:23] 11:1
[1:06:31] is sayth then hath God Cast Away his
[1:06:33] people God forbid for I also am an
[1:06:35] Israelite of the Seed of Abraham of the
[1:06:38] tribe of Judah of The Tribe of
[1:06:45] Benjamin so now if we jump over to
[1:06:47] Philippians
[1:06:53] 3:4
[1:06:56] though I might also have confidence in
[1:06:58] the in the flesh if any other man
[1:07:00] thinketh that he that he hath whereof he
[1:07:02] might Trust In the Flesh I
[1:07:12] more circumcised The Eighth Day of the
[1:07:15] stock of Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin
[1:07:17] and Hebrew of the Hebrews as touching
[1:07:20] the law of
[1:07:22] Pharisee so remember Jud and
[1:07:25] Benjamin one way or another they're
[1:07:29] connected and Naomi leaving the promised
[1:07:34] land it was Judah and Benjamin leaving
[1:07:36] the promised
[1:07:38] land Ruth Andi going back to the
[1:07:41] promised
[1:07:42] land that's Judah and
[1:07:45] Benjamin going back to the promised
[1:07:51] land now in the message questions and
[1:07:53] answers on the
[1:07:54] seals brother Bram
[1:08:00] says in the days of Paul the angel of
[1:08:02] the Church of Ephesus
[1:08:04] Paul founding this church being the
[1:08:06] messenger to
[1:08:10] it remember Paul founding the church at
[1:08:14] Ephesus became the messenger to that
[1:08:22] church and the Spirit was in the land at
[1:08:25] that time was The
[1:08:29] Lion and the lion is the lion of the
[1:08:32] tribe of
[1:08:33] Judah which is
[1:08:35] Christ and Christ is the
[1:08:38] word Paul with the word of that
[1:08:43] age so when Naomi leaves the promised
[1:08:46] land it's Judah and
[1:08:50] Benjamin leaving behind the promised
[1:08:52] land going unto
[1:08:56] Moab representing the Pagan
[1:09:00] Nations now in
[1:09:06] ruth6 after Naomi lived her carnal life
[1:09:09] now
[1:09:10] remember these two
[1:09:12] kingdoms the one of the
[1:09:15] north it had 10
[1:09:17] tribes those were
[1:09:20] carnal the one of the South it had two
[1:09:26] now God's true
[1:09:29] people is never called to live a fleshly
[1:09:33] life but we're in this
[1:09:36] flesh sometimes it happens that we we
[1:09:38] fall or we
[1:09:41] backslide God never
[1:09:44] wants for us to stay in that carnal
[1:09:47] condition if we
[1:09:50] backslide he's got a
[1:09:52] process to bring us back to the promised
[1:09:57] land so then
[1:10:00] Naomi she was not of the kingdom of the
[1:10:03] North she was of the kingdom of the
[1:10:08] South supposedly she needed to live a
[1:10:10] life in the promised
[1:10:12] land a life led by the Holy
[1:10:15] Ghost but she
[1:10:19] backslid being that she represents the
[1:10:22] Jews
[1:10:24] she was predestinated to eternal
[1:10:26] life God had to bring her
[1:10:29] back God doesn't lose the ones he
[1:10:33] saves God doesn't
[1:10:35] lose those he's
[1:10:40] predestinated your carnal
[1:10:44] decision if you decide to live
[1:10:47] carnally God will bring you
[1:10:50] back through much pain and suffering
[1:10:54] but that carnal
[1:10:56] decision that decision you
[1:10:58] made to live
[1:11:01] carnally and not live through the Holy
[1:11:04] Ghost in no
[1:11:07] way will that affect your salvation in
[1:11:10] heaven it just affects your life here on
[1:11:13] Earth but onto
[1:11:15] eternity what God Saves it's
[1:11:20] saved God doesn't go back on things
[1:11:24] on the decision he's
[1:11:26] made about his
[1:11:28] salvation but your carnal
[1:11:31] decision it affects your life here on
[1:11:34] the
[1:11:34] earth will not affect your eternal
[1:11:42] life now in
[1:11:52] ruth6
[1:11:54] then she arose with her daughters in the
[1:11:56] law that she might return from the
[1:11:58] country of Moab for she had heard in the
[1:12:00] country of Moab how that the Lord had
[1:12:01] visited his people in giving them
[1:12:12] bread wherefore she went forth out of
[1:12:14] the place where she was and her two
[1:12:16] daughters-in-law with her and they went
[1:12:18] out unto the way to return unto the land
[1:12:20] of
[1:12:22] Judah
[1:12:29] so Naomi returned but Ruth the moabitas
[1:12:32] her daughter-in-law with her which
[1:12:34] returned out which returned out of the
[1:12:36] country of Moab and they came to
[1:12:38] Bethlehem in the beginning of barley
[1:12:41] Harvest now remember
[1:12:44] Naomi she had two
[1:12:46] daughters that was Ruth and
[1:12:49] orpa you've been
[1:12:52] called to not live a carnal
[1:12:55] life but in the
[1:12:58] beginning you're in a carnal
[1:13:04] condition but you weren't called to live
[1:13:06] that carnal
[1:13:08] life you were called to live a life got
[1:13:10] led by the
[1:13:13] spirit you were called to live in the
[1:13:15] promised
[1:13:17] land so there was a separation Ruth
[1:13:20] between Ruth and
[1:13:22] Ora just like a
[1:13:25] separation of the 10 carnal
[1:13:28] tribes and the two
[1:13:31] tribes that would be led by the
[1:13:35] spirit but now these two
[1:13:38] tribes though they were led by the
[1:13:42] spirit they backslid into their carnal
[1:13:45] nation into their caral
[1:13:47] condition but since they're
[1:13:50] predestinated God has to bring them back
[1:13:52] to their position
[1:13:57] so then when Naomi and
[1:13:59] Ruth they go back to the promised
[1:14:04] land that was during The Barley
[1:14:08] Harvest now you use barley to make
[1:14:11] bread Just Like Us in every
[1:14:14] age we've had our bread our
[1:14:21] mana and Mana was bread that fell from
[1:14:26] heaven now the scripture that we read in
[1:14:28] the beginning Hosea chapter
[1:14:29] 6 verse
[1:14:41] three then shall we know if we follow
[1:14:44] unto know the Lord for his going forth
[1:14:46] is prepared as the morning and he shall
[1:14:48] come unto us as the rain as the latter
[1:14:51] and former rain unto the Earth
[1:14:56] brother Brown says in the message the
[1:14:57] spoken word is the Original
[1:15:01] Seed the the word former is the Hebrew
[1:15:04] word
[1:15:06] Mor which means
[1:15:11] teaching in other words it'll be a
[1:15:13] teaching rain and a harvest
[1:15:17] rain now we've had a now we've had the
[1:15:19] teaching
[1:15:21] rain now we're ready before the Harvest
[1:15:26] rain you know the first rain is when you
[1:15:29] plant the
[1:15:31] seed that's when they planted the barley
[1:15:36] seed that crop starts
[1:15:39] growing then just before it
[1:15:42] matures there comes another
[1:15:47] crop that's what they call the Harvest
[1:15:49] rain we know when that
[1:15:52] is the the spring
[1:15:55] rains then it rains about
[1:15:58] June it makes your
[1:16:00] crop now the
[1:16:03] rain we find out was the
[1:16:08] spirit so then when Naomi and
[1:16:11] Ruth they're going back to the promised
[1:16:15] land Naomi representing the
[1:16:18] Jews Ruth the
[1:16:22] Gentiles
[1:16:23] there's a rain that's falling down upon
[1:16:25] the promised
[1:16:28] land that rain brother brandham
[1:16:31] says in various parts of the
[1:16:34] message it says it's a
[1:16:42] Revival now during these time
[1:16:46] periods when there's seven Church
[1:16:49] ages and the Seven Church
[1:16:52] ages they're being led by the
[1:16:55] spirit because they have the baptism of
[1:16:57] the Holy
[1:16:58] Ghost the
[1:17:00] Jews they were scattered from their
[1:17:04] Homeland to different parts of the
[1:17:05] nation of the
[1:17:09] world brother brandham gives some
[1:17:12] teachings they're in Leviticus
[1:17:17] 23 and he says in the message
[1:17:19] recognizing your day and its
[1:17:22] message
[1:17:26] now we noticed last Sunday that there
[1:17:28] was preaching of the feast
[1:17:31] days there was a feast of
[1:17:35] Pentecost and between the Feast of
[1:17:37] Pentecost and the Feast of
[1:17:40] trumpets there was a long period of
[1:17:44] time exactly 50
[1:17:47] days between
[1:17:49] Pentecost and the Feast of the trumpets
[1:17:56] and 50 days which Pentecost means
[1:17:59] 50 it was the shef
[1:18:03] waving the first fruits Harvest was
[1:18:05] brought
[1:18:08] in and we see that it was a type back
[1:18:13] there with the natural first
[1:18:18] fruits representing the first fruits of
[1:18:21] the Holy Spirit to be poured out upon
[1:18:22] the
[1:18:24] people then we find
[1:18:28] out that them 50 days was received by
[1:18:31] the
[1:18:35] Gentiles which God called from the
[1:18:37] Gentiles a people for his
[1:18:40] name the Feast of
[1:18:46] Pentecost and we've been going through
[1:18:48] that long Feast of
[1:18:51] Pentecost
[1:18:54] now to call uh to call there would be
[1:18:57] the seven days of the
[1:19:01] sabbaths and that represents the seven
[1:19:03] Church
[1:19:07] ages to be called during the the Feast
[1:19:10] of the
[1:19:13] Pentecost to call a people from the
[1:19:15] Gentiles for his
[1:19:18] name now at the end of these seven
[1:19:21] sabbaths that have passed
[1:19:25] there was to be a day of
[1:19:27] atonement which was the seven
[1:19:30] trumpets and the Seven
[1:19:33] trumpets was to call a day of
[1:19:37] mourning back for the
[1:19:40] sacrifice or the
[1:19:47] atonement and we find out then that
[1:19:49] Israel the seven trumpets pertained only
[1:19:51] to Israel
[1:19:54] now remember it was
[1:19:55] Naomi that left the promised
[1:19:58] land it was Judah and
[1:20:00] Benjamin they left the promised
[1:20:02] land to be
[1:20:05] carinal it was a backsliding
[1:20:09] condition God's got to take us back to
[1:20:11] the
[1:20:12] condition so during that
[1:20:15] time when God wants to restore
[1:20:19] us God uses two
[1:20:21] Feasts the Feast of
[1:20:24] Pentecost which is for the
[1:20:26] Gentiles and the Feast of the
[1:20:29] trumpets it's for
[1:20:32] Israel now these two
[1:20:34] feasts there is something
[1:20:38] similar because both have
[1:20:42] trumpets one is literally called the
[1:20:44] Feast of the
[1:20:47] trumpets and us under the Feast of
[1:20:50] Pentecost we've had seven messagers
[1:20:53] with seven messages seven
[1:20:58] trumpets and our trumpet it's the
[1:21:05] gospel now the difference between these
[1:21:07] two
[1:21:08] feasts is that the Feast of
[1:21:11] Pentecost it gives access to the
[1:21:16] Believer by receiving the baptism of the
[1:21:18] Holy
[1:21:21] Ghost but the Feast of the
[1:21:25] trumpets it just sounds the
[1:21:29] trumpet and natural things happen in the
[1:21:32] life of the
[1:21:33] person that punishes
[1:21:36] them and takes them back unto the
[1:21:38] promised
[1:21:39] land because only in the promised
[1:21:42] land can God bless you if you're not
[1:21:48] there God has to take you back
[1:21:51] somehow so then the Feast of the
[1:21:55] trumpets there's no access to the Holy
[1:21:59] Ghost because they were
[1:22:02] carnal and in saying
[1:22:05] carnal basically it's
[1:22:08] saying to live a life without
[1:22:11] Christ without the revelation of his
[1:22:14] word you can be in
[1:22:17] church come to
[1:22:19] church and be a carnal believer
[1:22:24] Traditions dogas
[1:22:28] doctrines but without the love of
[1:22:31] Christ without
[1:22:33] revelation of the word of God in your
[1:22:38] heart so you as an
[1:22:41] individual your spiritual
[1:22:44] life can be under the life of the Feast
[1:22:46] of
[1:22:47] Pentecost where you should
[1:22:50] be under the baptism of the Holy
[1:22:53] Ghost being led by the
[1:22:56] spirit God working through
[1:22:59] you but if you've
[1:23:03] backslid under the Feast of the
[1:23:06] trumpets where you become
[1:23:09] carnal and that carnality the Bible
[1:23:11] says is enmity with
[1:23:17] God if you decide to live a carnal
[1:23:21] life remember it doesn't affect your
[1:23:25] salvation but it does affect your
[1:23:27] spiritual life here on the
[1:23:29] earth you remember
[1:23:34] Saul he went against God's
[1:23:39] people and in that time he didn't have a
[1:23:41] prophet to go
[1:23:43] to so the Bible says that he went with a
[1:23:45] witch brother brandham
[1:23:49] says being that in that time period they
[1:23:51] were not under the grace
[1:23:53] they were under the
[1:23:55] law under the blood the blood of bulls
[1:23:58] and
[1:24:01] goats so she could call the prophet
[1:24:03] Samuel from where he
[1:24:05] was and Samuel talks to
[1:24:08] Saul and says why have you called
[1:24:13] me being that you've now converted
[1:24:15] yourself to an enemy of
[1:24:19] God and said tomorrow you'll be here
[1:24:21] with me
[1:24:23] where was Samuel he was already in
[1:24:27] Paradise his carnal
[1:24:30] life our carnal
[1:24:32] life doesn't affect our
[1:24:35] Salvation if we've had the
[1:24:39] experience that we've accepted Jesus
[1:24:42] Christ as our
[1:24:45] savior but if you after the
[1:24:49] experience you deliberately decide
[1:24:53] to live
[1:24:55] carnally that carnal
[1:24:59] life can take you onto a premature
[1:25:04] death you weren't called to live
[1:25:08] carnally you weren't called To The Feast
[1:25:10] of the
[1:25:11] trumpets you were called to the Feast of
[1:25:18] Pentecost so Saul lost his life
[1:25:21] prematurely but he never lost his
[1:25:27] salvation so don't ever allow the devil
[1:25:31] to lie to
[1:25:33] you your mistakes here on the
[1:25:37] earth after you converted to a
[1:25:40] Christian by no
[1:25:42] way will it affect your
[1:25:45] salvation by no
[1:25:47] means it only affects your life here on
[1:25:50] the
[1:25:51] Earth
[1:25:57] brother Bron says in the message
[1:25:58] recognizing your day and its
[1:26:00] message Israel's in her
[1:26:03] land drove them in
[1:26:06] there hered them there like
[1:26:13] sheep the loaves got the Wolves got
[1:26:16] after them and it run them back to
[1:26:17] safety to their own
[1:26:21] land
[1:26:25] remember Israel is only promised to be
[1:26:27] blessed as long as she was in her
[1:26:32] land God never blesses Israel outside of
[1:26:35] the
[1:26:37] land Abraham went outside the land and
[1:26:40] was
[1:26:43] condemned everyone that leaves the land
[1:26:45] is
[1:26:50] condemned God can only bless is Israel
[1:26:52] when she stays in her
[1:26:55] Homeland remember it's Naomi and
[1:26:58] Ruth that went back to the
[1:27:01] Homeland now Benjamin and
[1:27:04] Judah they went back to their
[1:27:11] Homeland brother BR says in the message
[1:27:13] questions and answers on Hebrews number
[1:27:17] two now when the end time
[1:27:20] comes when we're getting down to the
[1:27:27] end if I see it right the gospel in here
[1:27:29] there's supposed to be a great
[1:27:33] Revival now did you know that the that
[1:27:35] the Jewish
[1:27:38] flag is the oldest flag in the
[1:27:42] world and it's been laying dormant for
[1:27:45] 2,000 years more than
[1:27:48] that about 2500
[1:27:51] years
[1:27:54] that Jewish flag the Sixpoint Star of
[1:27:59] David never flowed for 2500
[1:28:04] years since the carrying away of
[1:28:08] Babylon and when the Roman Empire took
[1:28:10] over
[1:28:13] them and the Messiah come and they
[1:28:15] rejected
[1:28:18] it and they were scattered to the Four
[1:28:20] Winds of the Earth
[1:28:24] but did you know that on May 6th
[1:28:28] 1946 that that flag came back over
[1:28:31] Jerusalem
[1:28:34] again did you know that on May the 7th
[1:28:38] 1946 one day
[1:28:41] later the angel of the Lord appeared to
[1:28:46] me and sent me up into the whole world
[1:28:49] to bring forth a
[1:28:51] Revival
[1:28:52] the very next
[1:28:56] morning when that flag was raised in
[1:29:00] Jerusalem as the going down of the Sun
[1:29:02] that
[1:29:06] afternoon the angel of the Lord appeared
[1:29:08] here in the United States at the same
[1:29:12] time so during the time of brother
[1:29:15] brandham during the
[1:29:18] time of the promised
[1:29:20] restoration
[1:29:22] of those that are of the promised
[1:29:24] land Judah and
[1:29:27] Benjamin the Jews go back literally to
[1:29:29] their
[1:29:32] Homeland and brother brandom literally
[1:29:33] has to go through the na to the
[1:29:35] Nations to take out a
[1:29:38] bride it's Judah and
[1:29:40] Benjamin going back to the promised
[1:29:44] land but now with brother
[1:29:48] bradam it's a spiritual
[1:29:50] Revival
[1:29:52] but now with the
[1:29:54] Jews it's a literal
[1:29:57] Revival they don't have the
[1:30:01] spirit the Jews today have access to the
[1:30:03] spirit
[1:30:05] Gentiles but now
[1:30:08] both they're going back to their
[1:30:16] Homeland now the message recognizing
[1:30:18] your day and its
[1:30:20] message
[1:30:22] now at the end of these seven sabbaths
[1:30:24] which has
[1:30:27] been there was to be the day of
[1:30:30] atonement which was the seven
[1:30:34] trumpets and the Seven trumpets was to
[1:30:36] call a day of
[1:30:40] M back for the sacrifice or the
[1:30:46] atonement now if you read in Leviticus
[1:30:48] 23 there's seven Feasts
[1:30:52] the Feast of
[1:30:55] Pentecost the one which the whole
[1:30:57] Gentile
[1:30:58] church it's under that Feast that
[1:31:02] Feast it gives
[1:31:04] access to the baptism of the Holy
[1:31:07] Ghost and the revelation of Jesus
[1:31:10] Christ but the
[1:31:13] Jews they're under the Feast of the
[1:31:15] trumpets those
[1:31:19] trumpets it caused them to pay the price
[1:31:23] because they rejected the
[1:31:26] Messiah the punishment was to be cast
[1:31:29] out of their
[1:31:31] Homeland but they've also got to come
[1:31:33] back to the
[1:31:36] Homeland they're also a part of the
[1:31:38] promised
[1:31:40] land God can only bless
[1:31:43] them if they're in the promised
[1:31:50] land now remember number number
[1:31:54] 10 is the number of the carinal
[1:31:59] nature now then after the
[1:32:02] Jews under the Feast of the
[1:32:05] trumpets they go back unto their
[1:32:08] Homeland now God can reveal himself to
[1:32:11] them he can now bless
[1:32:14] them to the next
[1:32:16] Feast which they go
[1:32:19] to is the Feast of the atonement
[1:32:22] the
[1:32:24] atonement it's the offering made for sin
[1:32:28] for The
[1:32:30] Sinner now Leviticus
[1:32:35] 2326 and the Lord spake unto Moses
[1:32:43] say and on the 10th day of the seventh
[1:32:45] month there shall be a day of
[1:32:47] atonement what day was
[1:32:49] this on the 10th day
[1:32:53] number 10 is the number of
[1:32:56] carnality the Jews are carnal right
[1:32:59] now because they don't have the Holy
[1:33:02] Ghost they go back onto their
[1:33:06] Homeland they go back they now go under
[1:33:09] the Feast of
[1:33:12] atonement and on the 10th day of that
[1:33:16] month they'll have a holy
[1:33:20] convocation
[1:33:22] and you shall afflict your
[1:33:25] souls verse
[1:33:28] 28 you shall do no work in the same
[1:33:31] day for it is a day of
[1:33:36] atonement to make an atonement for you
[1:33:39] before the Lord your
[1:33:41] God I like how it says it in
[1:33:45] Spanish because you are
[1:33:49] backslid when you enter under under the
[1:33:51] Feast of
[1:33:54] atonement the reason why it says that
[1:33:56] your soul is affli
[1:33:59] Afflicted because you've
[1:34:01] recognized you've left the promised land
[1:34:04] you've left the
[1:34:06] Lord but you're
[1:34:08] predestinated God brings you
[1:34:10] back and you
[1:34:14] recognize what was your mistake right
[1:34:16] here on the
[1:34:18] earth that's why there's an Affliction
[1:34:20] in your soul
[1:34:23] you
[1:34:25] recognize the mistake you made in the
[1:34:29] past but since you're
[1:34:32] predestinated there's no way to be
[1:34:35] lost you were
[1:34:38] called to live under the Feast of
[1:34:41] Pentecost you decided to live
[1:34:44] carnally or you made a caral
[1:34:47] decision God restores
[1:34:50] you through much much
[1:34:52] persecution many
[1:34:54] tests many things that happen to
[1:34:57] you you go from the Feast of the
[1:35:00] trumpets to the Feast of
[1:35:05] atonement and you recognize where you
[1:35:07] decided to start living
[1:35:10] carnally what was your carnal
[1:35:16] mistake that's why it says that your
[1:35:19] soul will be an affliction
[1:35:22] you'll
[1:35:24] notice where you made a
[1:35:27] mistake all that is the grace of the
[1:35:31] Lord though you decided to live
[1:35:34] carnally not under the grace of the
[1:35:37] Lord that gives you access to the
[1:35:40] spirit God will use the Feast of the
[1:35:42] trumpets to take you
[1:35:45] back and then the Feast of
[1:35:50] atonement so you can recognize your
[1:35:52] mistake where you left
[1:35:54] Christ when you recognize your
[1:35:58] mistake you repent
[1:36:00] sincerely then something you
[1:36:03] do you go back to
[1:36:06] Calvary you repent
[1:36:11] again and the Jews go through the same
[1:36:14] process on a bigger
[1:36:17] scale you just as an
[1:36:19] individual if you leave the Lord
[1:36:22] God will restore
[1:36:26] you but you'll have to repent once
[1:36:30] again because of the mistake you made in
[1:36:32] the
[1:36:33] past but by no means by no
[1:36:36] means will it affect your
[1:36:39] salvation nor your position there in
[1:36:44] eternity but it can take you to a
[1:36:46] premature
[1:36:49] death you remember brother brandham
[1:36:55] when he obeyed his
[1:36:58] mother-in-law remember
[1:37:01] Naomi for 10 years she was out there in
[1:37:05] Moab brother Bram around the year
[1:37:10] 1936 that's when he went to those
[1:37:12] meetings for that
[1:37:16] Revival they invited him to go preach at
[1:37:19] their
[1:37:19] churches he was going to do
[1:37:23] it but his mother-in-law said I don't
[1:37:25] want you to do
[1:37:28] that I don't want you to take my
[1:37:30] daughter with that bunch of
[1:37:33] trash the prophet listened to his
[1:37:37] mother-in-law instead of listening to
[1:37:40] God because he used the ministry of the
[1:37:43] Prophet to bring a
[1:37:45] Revival a lad
[1:37:48] rain unto the gentile people
[1:37:53] they got access to the reain of the Holy
[1:37:55] Ghost they're under the Feast of
[1:38:00] Pentecost because of that single carnal
[1:38:05] decision the flood came one year later
[1:38:07] in
[1:38:09] Jeffersonville he lost his wife and his
[1:38:13] daughter because of a single
[1:38:16] decision of Disobedience to
[1:38:19] God but by
[1:38:22] means didn't affect brother brandom's
[1:38:25] salvation nor the salvation of sister
[1:38:30] hope your life here on the
[1:38:34] earth after you accept
[1:38:37] Christ if you
[1:38:39] backslid by no
[1:38:42] means will it affect your
[1:38:45] salvation by no
[1:38:47] means will it affect your eternal
[1:38:50] life but it will affect your life on
[1:38:55] Earth you weren't called under the Feast
[1:38:57] of the
[1:38:59] trumpets you weren't called to be a Jew
[1:39:01] a carnal
[1:39:03] Jew you were called to be a
[1:39:07] Jew Paul says that's the Jew of the
[1:39:12] heart brother BR says that's a Christian
[1:39:14] filled with the Holy
[1:39:15] Ghost you weren't called to be
[1:39:19] orpa that was in the carnal land of
[1:39:23] Moab you were called to be
[1:39:25] Ruth that will leave that carnal
[1:39:28] land and go to the promised
[1:39:32] land but if you
[1:39:34] backslide God's going to take you back
[1:39:37] by no means by no
[1:39:40] means does it affect your
[1:39:43] salvation we're under the
[1:39:49] grace but your
[1:39:52] decision will affect your life here on
[1:39:55] the
[1:39:59] earth you should listen to two messages
[1:40:01] brother Brandon
[1:40:03] preaches the fifth
[1:40:05] seal and the Feast of the
[1:40:08] trumpets in the fifth seal the Bible
[1:40:10] speaks
[1:40:12] about there are souls under the
[1:40:15] altar those Souls now
[1:40:18] see brother BR makes an emphasis on this
[1:40:22] they'd ask for
[1:40:25] vengeance because they were killed here
[1:40:26] on the
[1:40:30] earth brother brand says if those Souls
[1:40:32] were
[1:40:33] Gentiles or members of the
[1:40:36] Bride they would not ask for
[1:40:39] vengeance they'd speak like Ste
[1:40:43] Steven when they were stoning him and
[1:40:45] killing
[1:40:46] him he said father forgive
[1:40:49] them
[1:40:52] but these Souls that were under the
[1:40:55] altar they received white
[1:40:58] robes they received
[1:41:02] salvation but they never had the
[1:41:06] opportunity to accept Christ here on the
[1:41:10] earth they never entered under the Feast
[1:41:13] of
[1:41:14] Pentecost they're under the Feast of the
[1:41:18] trumpets they were they were blinded by
[1:41:20] God himself
[1:41:22] so that you and
[1:41:25] I we can come under the Feast of
[1:41:28] Pentecost under the baptism of the Holy
[1:41:31] Ghost and in that
[1:41:34] Feast you're led by the
[1:41:37] spirit you've got the revelation of the
[1:41:39] word of
[1:41:41] God the Jews though they're the people
[1:41:43] of
[1:41:44] God they don't have the baptism of the
[1:41:46] Holy
[1:41:48] Ghost they have the revelation of Jesus
[1:41:50] Christ
[1:41:52] that he's the
[1:41:54] Messiah but they had to pay with their
[1:41:57] life for the carinal
[1:42:00] decision that their forefathers
[1:42:03] did by rejecting the
[1:42:05] Messiah they go back unto their
[1:42:08] Homeland under the Feast of the
[1:42:12] trumpets they go to the Feast of
[1:42:16] atonement when Christ reveals himself to
[1:42:19] them through two prophets Moses and
[1:42:23] Elijah he starts to reveal
[1:42:28] himself and they start to preach the
[1:42:31] Gospel of Jesus
[1:42:32] Christ that's why brother Ram says this
[1:42:35] same message that we
[1:42:38] have one day will go with the
[1:42:42] Jews the same message that we
[1:42:45] have the same latter
[1:42:48] rain the same baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:42:51] will go with
[1:42:53] them and they'll have their
[1:42:55] Revival not
[1:42:57] literally they've already had it they're
[1:43:00] in their
[1:43:02] Homeland they have a spiritual
[1:43:06] Revival the baptism of the Holy
[1:43:09] Ghost recognizing that Christ is their
[1:43:11] Messiah and nonetheless their
[1:43:15] soul will be
[1:43:17] afflicted they'll
[1:43:19] recognize they their
[1:43:29] Messiah that's when these scriptures are
[1:43:33] fulfilled in Zechariah
[1:43:39] 136 and they shall ask unto him what are
[1:43:42] these wounds in thine
[1:43:46] hands and then he shall answer those
[1:43:49] with which I was wounded in the house of
[1:43:50] my
[1:43:52] friends now Zechariah
[1:43:56] 1210 and I will pour upon the House of
[1:43:59] David what was the House of David Judah
[1:44:03] you and Benjamin the
[1:44:06] Jews if you
[1:44:08] backslide this scripture is for
[1:44:12] you you were taken back unto your
[1:44:15] Homeland taken back unto the Promised
[1:44:19] Land it's only by
[1:44:22] grace that you can enter into the
[1:44:24] promised
[1:44:26] land because Moses brother brandham says
[1:44:29] represents the
[1:44:32] Law that just took them to the border of
[1:44:35] the promised
[1:44:36] land but Joshua as
[1:44:39] Grace representing the Holy
[1:44:42] Ghost them into the promis
[1:44:47] land so then when it says that I would
[1:44:49] pour upon the house of
[1:44:52] David and the inhabitants of
[1:44:55] Jerusalem Spirit of
[1:44:58] Grace that's the
[1:45:00] Jews the backsliding
[1:45:03] people that are going back to their
[1:45:06] Homeland going back to the
[1:45:09] Lord going back to the Holy
[1:45:14] Spirit and of
[1:45:17] prayer and will see me whom they pass
[1:45:26] and they shall mourn for him as one that
[1:45:27] mourneth only for his son and shall be
[1:45:30] bitterness in him as the one of the
[1:45:31] bitterness for his
[1:45:35] firstborn they go through the process of
[1:45:37] the
[1:45:38] feast to be restored to their
[1:45:42] Homeland you'll go through the same
[1:45:45] process because you're also of the House
[1:45:47] of
[1:45:48] David you're of the house of God
[1:45:52] and our David is
[1:45:54] Christ you go through the same process
[1:45:58] if you leave
[1:45:59] God by no
[1:46:02] means by no means does it affect your
[1:46:05] salvation it affects your life here on
[1:46:07] the
[1:46:12] earth remember brother brandom he was
[1:46:14] invited to go preach to those
[1:46:17] churches like around the year 1936
[1:46:21] and then in
[1:46:23] 37 the flood
[1:46:26] came it was about 10 years
[1:46:29] later that the Lord then appeared to
[1:46:37] him brother Bram says in the message a
[1:46:41] life his life
[1:46:43] story oh my there it
[1:46:46] was and here's where I made my mistake
[1:46:49] friends
[1:46:52] I listen to my mother-in-law instead of
[1:46:54] listening to
[1:46:57] God and if I would have went ahead
[1:47:02] then this great thing would have been
[1:47:04] manifested before
[1:47:08] this and the church had been farther
[1:47:13] along our carnal
[1:47:17] decisions maybe they just affect us
[1:47:20] maybe they affect
[1:47:24] others and for that reason God will make
[1:47:26] you go through that
[1:47:28] Feast it's going to take you back to the
[1:47:30] promised
[1:47:31] land for God to bless
[1:47:34] you and bless others through
[1:47:41] you so then the
[1:47:44] Jews they go from the Feast of the
[1:47:47] trumpets to the Feast of atonement
[1:47:51] they recognize Christ as their
[1:47:53] Messiah they accept what he's
[1:47:59] done Christ is not sacrificed once
[1:48:02] again he doesn't have to shed his blood
[1:48:04] once
[1:48:05] again they just
[1:48:08] simply accept what he's already
[1:48:11] done what they
[1:48:14] do they go back to
[1:48:17] Calvary they accept the sacrifice he
[1:48:19] made on Calvary
[1:48:21] you do the same thing you make a
[1:48:24] mistake you recognize your
[1:48:28] mistake Christ doesn't have to shed his
[1:48:30] blood once again for
[1:48:32] you the blood is still
[1:48:34] fresh you go back to
[1:48:37] Calvary how do you go back to
[1:48:39] Calvary
[1:48:41] repenting and confessing your
[1:48:47] sins they go from Feast of trumpets
[1:48:50] to the Feast of
[1:48:54] atonement there they accept Christ as
[1:48:56] his as their
[1:48:58] Messiah they accept him as their
[1:49:01] savior then they go onto another
[1:49:04] feast in Revelation
[1:49:06] 14 verse
[1:49:19] one and I looked and lo a lamb stood on
[1:49:22] the Mount Zion and with him 144,000
[1:49:25] having his father's name written on
[1:49:27] their
[1:49:30] foreheads now notice the
[1:49:33] 144,000 they've got his name and the
[1:49:36] name of his
[1:49:37] father and Christ said when he was here
[1:49:39] on the
[1:49:41] earth I've come in the name of my
[1:49:44] father the name of the father Son and
[1:49:47] Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:49:51] Christ so these
[1:49:55] 144,000 they have his name and his
[1:49:59] father have already accepted Christ as
[1:50:01] their
[1:50:03] savior he says in verse
[1:50:12] two and I Heard a Voice from Heaven and
[1:50:15] the voice of many Waters and as the
[1:50:17] voice of a great Thunder and I heard the
[1:50:18] voice of Harpers harping with their
[1:50:21] hearts now they're playing
[1:50:24] music they're they're in a
[1:50:41] feast and they sung it as it were a new
[1:50:43] song before the throne and before the
[1:50:45] four beasts and the elders and no man
[1:50:47] could learn that song but the 144 th000
[1:50:50] which were redeemed from the
[1:51:06] earth these are they which were not
[1:51:08] defiled with women for they are virgins
[1:51:10] these are they which follow the lamb
[1:51:11] withs soever that he goeth these were
[1:51:14] the redeemed from all from among men
[1:51:16] being the first fruits unto God and to
[1:51:17] the
[1:51:18] lamb the
[1:51:21] Feast of the
[1:51:22] trumpets where they don't have the
[1:51:25] spirit but they're
[1:51:27] predestinated they're taken back to
[1:51:29] their
[1:51:30] Homeland Feast of
[1:51:32] atonement they recognize their mistakes
[1:51:35] they
[1:51:37] repent they accept Christ as their
[1:51:41] savior he gives them entrance into the
[1:51:43] promised
[1:51:44] land in the spiritual sense under
[1:51:48] grace now they have access to the Holy
[1:51:53] Ghost now they go onto the Feast of the
[1:51:55] first fruits and the first
[1:51:59] fruit it's the Holy
[1:52:02] Ghost you
[1:52:05] also will go through the same
[1:52:08] process you and being
[1:52:10] carnal don't allow that the
[1:52:14] spirit lives as it wants to in you and
[1:52:18] guide you
[1:52:20] but you being
[1:52:23] restored you're restored back unto the
[1:52:26] joy of your
[1:52:31] salvation brother Bram says David never
[1:52:34] lost his
[1:52:35] salvation he lost the
[1:52:39] joy The Joy brother brand says is the
[1:52:42] anointing of the holy
[1:52:43] spirit it's that rain that falls from
[1:52:48] heaven let us stay
[1:53:02] stand if the musicians could come
[1:53:05] forward let us

[1:53:30] Jesus
[1:53:31] Christ that today reveals to
[1:53:36] us if we're not in the condition we need
[1:53:38] to
[1:53:41] be if we're not located in the position
[1:53:44] here on the
[1:53:46] earth you've got a process to restore us
[1:53:50] but it will cost us so

[1:54:02] grace give us of your

[1:54:20] Christ that comes upon
[1:54:23] us and can lead Our
