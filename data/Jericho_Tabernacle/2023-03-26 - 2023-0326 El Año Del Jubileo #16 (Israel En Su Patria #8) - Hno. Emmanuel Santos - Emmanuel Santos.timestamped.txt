[45:26] [Music]
[45:30] just like if you're standing we can open
[45:33] up our Bibles to Jeremiah 32 6.
[45:41] yeah
[45:45] we're going to start on verse six
[45:50] Jeremiah 32 6.
[45:56] and Jeremiah said the word of the Lord
[45:58] came unto me saying
[46:08] behold the son of Shalom
[46:12] shall come unto thee saying by by thee
[46:16] my field that is in anathoth for the
[46:18] right of redemption is is dying to buy
[46:20] it
[46:41] my uncle's son came to me in the court
[46:43] of the prison according to the word of
[46:45] the Lord and said unto me by my field I
[46:48] pray thee that is anathoth which is the
[46:51] country of Benjamin for the right of the
[46:53] inheritance is thine and the Redemption
[46:55] is thine buy it for thyself then I know
[46:58] that this was the word of the Lord
[47:00] is
[47:07] and I bought the field of animals my
[47:10] uncle's son that was in anathoth and
[47:12] await him the money even 17 shekels of
[47:15] silver
[47:16] embalances
[47:22] and I subscribe the evidence and sealed
[47:25] it and took the witnesses and weighed
[47:27] him the money and the balances
[47:34] so I took the evidence of the purchase
[47:36] both that which was sealed according to
[47:38] the law and custom that which was open
[47:41] area
[47:54] and I gave the evidence of the purchase
[47:57] onto Barack the son of naraya the son of
[47:59] Messiah and the side of hanamel my
[48:01] uncle's son and in the presence of the
[48:03] witnesses that described the book of the
[48:05] purchase before all the Jews that sat in
[48:07] the court of the prison
[48:11] and I charged Barack before them saying
[48:16] is
[48:27] the god of Israel take these evidence
[48:29] and the evidence of the purchase both
[48:32] which is sealed and this evidence will
[48:34] just open and put them in the Earthen
[48:36] vessel that they may continue many days
[48:41] of his word you may take your seats
[48:54] I'd like to speak on the 14th verse
[49:00] where it says there was two uh letters
[49:03] or two purchases
[49:07] the evidence of the purchase that was
[49:10] sealed is
[49:12] and this evidence which is open
[49:16] so these two portions
[49:19] were placed in an Earthen vessel
[49:23] now brother Bram says in the message
[49:28] Gabriel's instructions to Daniel
[49:35] in the Old Testament property could not
[49:37] be or could not be held any longer than
[49:39] 50 days 50 years
[49:42] the your 50th is the Year of Jubilee
[49:45] esta
[49:47] Del due original por Mazda cincuenta you
[49:51] cannot be annihilated from its original
[49:53] owner but 50 years
[49:57] and on the 40th Day he paid the price
[50:04] and on the 50th day of the Redemption
[50:07] and the power that belonged to the
[50:08] church
[50:11] that was lost in the Garden of Eden
[50:14] foreign
[50:53] [Music]
[51:09] it says shows where the power of God
[51:14] and the Scrolls and the secrets of God
[51:16] is known in
[51:19] the heart
[51:21] or Plan of Redemption
[51:26] the same being kept in Earthly vessels
[51:29] Jesus
[51:31] name and the Revelation
[51:34] so when Jeremiah
[51:38] took the open portion
[51:40] and the sealed portion
[51:43] and place that an
[51:49] Eartha places the open portions and the
[51:53] portion that sealed
[51:55] at the plan of his Redemption
[51:57] [Music]
[51:58] he places it in our human hearts una
[52:02] Persona a person
[52:04] can have both portions in the use in
[52:08] them
[52:09] this is more important now that's very
[52:11] important una Persona a person
[52:14] can have both portions
[52:17] being reflected through their heart
[52:20] foreign
[52:46] for all of them that believe in him
[52:48] shall not be lost but have eternal life
[52:59] now there's two sides or portions to
[53:01] Redemption
[53:03] and this scripture shows it
[53:06] but it explains it a bit more
[53:09] there's an open part yeah and there's a
[53:13] sealed part
[53:15] now this example of this open portion
[53:20] and the portion that's sealed uh
[53:25] that can be applied or explained through
[53:28] many portions of the Bible
[53:31] explain a lot of things in the message
[53:33] and in the in the Bible
[53:35] but since we're Limited in time
[53:38] I want to take I'll only take one
[53:40] example
[53:42] and that is the
[53:45] rainbows
[53:47] if you can up your Bibles to Second
[53:50] Corinthians chapter 4 verse 6 and 7.
[53:56] we spoke on both portions
[54:00] and that we have those two portions in
[54:05] our hearts
[54:08] second Corinthians 4 6.
[54:12] and we're also speaking about the
[54:14] rainbow
[54:16] now rainbow gives out colors of light is
[54:30] for God who commanded the light to shine
[54:33] out of darkness and shine in our hearts
[54:35] to give the light of the knowledge of
[54:37] the glory of God in the face of Jesus
[54:39] Christ
[54:40] [Music]
[54:42] reflects Darkness
[54:44] or reflex reflects light your heart is
[54:50] can reflect the rainbow
[54:52] now what is a rainbow
[55:02] sacrifice has been accepted
[55:10] that you have accepted the sacrifice of
[55:13] Jesus Christ
[55:15] now if you accept the sacrifice of Jesus
[55:17] Christ
[55:20] now that reflects the rainbow through
[55:22] your heart
[55:24] now the seventh verse it says
[55:32] so we have this treasure and Earthen
[55:35] vessels that the Excellency of the power
[55:38] may be of God and not of us
[55:41] because we are Earth and vessels
[55:47] we can have both portions of redemption
[55:53] now in us we can reflect the light that
[55:57] we have is
[55:58] that that is through our heart
[56:12] the 12th verse
[56:16] now this is After the flood with Noah
[56:21] the 12th verse it says
[56:32] and God said this is the token of the
[56:35] Covenant which I made between me and you
[56:37] and every living creature that is with
[56:38] you for Perpetual generations
[56:46] and I do set my bowl in the cloud and
[56:49] there shall be for a token for a
[56:51] covenant between me and the Earth
[56:53] you see notice on 13th verse
[56:56] says the ball the rainbow is
[57:00] the token of the Covenant
[57:16] that is God's covenant that he made with
[57:19] Earth
[57:21] they're not just they explain our lights
[57:24] not the 14th verse this is
[57:33] when I bring a cloud over the Earth that
[57:36] the bow shall be seen in the cloud
[57:40] we noticed we said there's two portions
[57:43] there's an open portion and there is a
[57:46] sealed portion now there's a rainbow
[57:49] there's a cabinet
[57:52] that is available to all
[57:58] for us who are here on Earth
[58:01] every person that's here on Earth
[58:03] Cristiano Christians
[58:06] atheists
[58:09] believer or unbelievable
[58:11] if you believe in God or you don't
[58:14] believe in God
[58:16] everyone can see the rainbow
[58:24] there's an open portion in God's
[58:27] covenants
[58:28] that can benefit the whole world
[58:32] but
[58:33] there is a sealed portion
[58:36] of God's covenant
[58:39] beneficiar that it only benefits
[58:42] one single person
[58:45] and that is the bride
[58:50] as for the whole world
[59:12] and he took the cup and gave thanks and
[59:14] gave it to them saying drink ye all of
[59:16] it is
[59:22] for this is my blood of the test of the
[59:26] new testament which is said for many of
[59:27] remission of sins
[59:31] now the blood is a blood of the of the
[59:34] Covenant
[59:35] and the rainbow
[59:37] it is
[59:45] my brother random went to the restaurant
[59:49] and there was an elderly lady there with
[59:51] two police officers
[1:00:50] the second
[1:00:59] that blood that blood of Christ is the
[1:01:02] only thing that keeps the wrath of God
[1:01:04] off of us tonight
[1:01:07] there's an open portion
[1:01:09] the benefits the whole world
[1:01:12] the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:01:15] that right now it protects everyone in
[1:01:17] the whole world from God's Wrath for now
[1:01:26] how would I
[1:01:27] Tiempo because of time
[1:01:31] I'm gonna go to paragraph eight eight
[1:01:35] we know that brother Brandon repented
[1:01:37] right
[1:01:39] and he asked Jesus to forgive him
[1:01:43] in paragraph a brother says
[1:01:48] and I said I was the one who did that
[1:01:51] will you forgive me Jesus
[1:01:54] and when God forgave brother Branham
[1:01:59] he said he took his hand
[1:02:02] and he dipped it inside
[1:02:05] why on his side
[1:02:07] because in the cross
[1:02:10] they pierced aside and what came out of
[1:02:14] there
[1:02:15] his church came out
[1:02:51] forgetfulness never to remember it
[1:02:53] against me no more
[1:02:55] now what Jesus did is biblical it is
[1:03:10] it talks about the high priest
[1:03:13] and Jesus is our high priest
[1:03:29] and sprinkle it with his finger upon The
[1:03:31] Mercy Seat Eastward and before the mercy
[1:03:34] seat shout he sprinkle of blood with his
[1:03:36] finger seven times
[1:03:39] through his finger in the blood seven
[1:03:43] times
[1:03:48] Revelation chapter four part three
[1:03:51] it says Eastward
[1:03:56] where was the sacrifice place as oriente
[1:04:01] towards the east
[1:04:33] as many as could to bring papers and so
[1:04:36] forth
[1:04:38] to get these maps in a few minutes
[1:04:42] he said all right sprinkle it
[1:04:46] eastwards
[1:04:48] and before the mercy seat shall be he
[1:04:51] sprinkled
[1:04:53] that isn't that wonderful
[1:04:57] seven times towards the east what is it
[1:05:00] is
[1:05:04] the seven Church ages shall be covered
[1:05:06] by the blood
[1:05:08] so one brother random asked for
[1:05:10] forgiveness is
[1:05:13] right here what he's telling us right
[1:05:15] now so Jesus
[1:05:18] and pardoning him
[1:05:23] the blood of Jesus Christ is sufficient
[1:05:26] yesterday boy today and forever
[1:05:30] and to every age
[1:05:33] to save every sinner
[1:05:36] here every sick person
[1:05:39] bring every Miracle
[1:05:42] every sign to pass
[1:05:44] seven times
[1:05:47] way back Yonder in the Old Testament
[1:05:49] milk
[1:05:53] 490 years before Christ came
[1:05:56] aura
[1:05:59] as we just saw
[1:06:01] Cristo it was Christ
[1:06:04] that took his finger and dipped it in
[1:06:07] the blood
[1:06:08] what does the finger represent in Lucas
[1:06:12] and Luke 11 20 says
[1:06:20] but if I was the Finger of God cast out
[1:06:24] Devils no doubt the kingdom of God has
[1:06:26] come upon you
[1:06:28] know we know the four Gospels
[1:06:32] it speaks about the same thing that
[1:06:34] Jesus spoke
[1:06:35] but in different different aspects
[1:06:40] now and Lucas says the Finger of God
[1:06:43] foreign
[1:06:58] but if I cast out the Devils by the
[1:07:01] spirit of God then the kingdom of God
[1:07:03] has come come unto you
[1:07:05] now what does their finger represent
[1:07:09] it is the spirit of God Jesus
[1:07:12] so when God took his finger
[1:07:16] and dipped it inside
[1:07:19] and pardon brother Branham
[1:07:23] so when the high priest would take his
[1:07:25] fingers
[1:07:29] it will sprinkle it seven times
[1:07:32] it will speak of Jesus Christ
[1:07:35] that physically he's up there
[1:07:38] but it takes the spirit
[1:07:42] and he applies the blood seven times
[1:07:46] to the seven Church ages
[1:07:49] that is what the finger represents is
[1:07:53] God's spirit that applies the blood
[1:07:58] there's a there's a drop of blood for
[1:07:59] Paul irino Martin iridius Martin Luther
[1:08:03] Columbus Wesley Wesley and for brother
[1:08:07] Branham
[1:08:39] or proudly displaying the blood of Jesus
[1:08:42] Christ upon their chest
[1:08:46] the message of God and the hour that
[1:08:48] they lived in
[1:08:50] so in every age it had his message
[1:08:55] that message came the power of the blood
[1:08:59] through the through the blood of Jesus
[1:09:01] about the blood of God
[1:09:05] I purchased our salvation
[1:09:08] portion
[1:09:21] now in that open portion
[1:09:24] that one has to pray but uh
[1:09:29] so another person can be saved
[1:09:32] just like you fathers and mothers
[1:09:36] you're praying so your children can be
[1:09:38] saved
[1:09:39] you pray
[1:09:41] so you can receive your healing
[1:09:46] benefits and God's covenant is
[1:09:58] a higher
[1:10:57] you don't no longer have to pray
[1:11:00] you no longer have to have a vision
[1:11:03] just speak it
[1:11:38] not anyone can use that portion
[1:11:42] only mature people
[1:11:45] it's not the one the size
[1:11:48] tough shot for me to use that power
[1:11:51] now if you listen to the tapes
[1:11:56] it was goddess and his Sovereign Grace
[1:12:00] that told him to do it
[1:12:03] is decided to do it portion
[1:12:11] okay
[1:12:13] are you not are you not quiris abierto
[1:12:16] now there's an open rainbow yeah
[1:12:18] and there's a sealed rainbow all right
[1:12:24] and the message shows the father in
[1:12:27] outside of space
[1:12:31] then I see it in Revelation 1.
[1:12:38] when the rainbow was across the throne
[1:12:40] where Jesus was standing
[1:12:44] a covenant God had made with his people
[1:12:50] he was to look upon a Jasper and sardia
[1:12:53] stone
[1:12:55] there's no time to to speak on these
[1:12:58] stones
[1:12:59] but this is the first and the last
[1:13:03] which is in shall come
[1:13:06] the root and offspring of David
[1:13:09] the Morning Star come on as a rainbow
[1:13:33] it has a Grace
[1:13:36] the grace of Salvation
[1:13:39] as the only Grace
[1:13:43] that has an open portion
[1:13:49] now that open portion noise it's not
[1:13:53] complete without the other portions
[1:13:57] now you need both portions
[1:14:00] you need both Grace what is the first
[1:14:04] Grace or the second is
[1:14:09] rapturing Grace
[1:14:11] now there's a a initiative or a
[1:14:14] beginning Grace
[1:14:15] now there's a ending or a
[1:14:18] Finnish Grace
[1:14:20] now the first Grace the Salvation it
[1:14:23] gives salvation
[1:14:24] second grace
[1:14:28] it gives you the faith of rapture
[1:14:32] and we'll enter that in a bit
[1:14:37] now the reason why there's an open
[1:14:40] portion and there's a sealed portion
[1:14:44] when we speak about the rainbow
[1:14:48] everybody here in this world and this
[1:14:50] everybody in this world can see the
[1:14:52] rainbow
[1:14:53] but there's another rainbow
[1:14:56] that's not here on Earth
[1:15:02] and that and since not everyone is going
[1:15:04] to go to heaven
[1:15:07] they can't see the second portion of the
[1:15:10] rainbow
[1:15:11] the first rainbow is
[1:15:17] there in heaven middle
[1:15:21] and now even brother Branham ministerio
[1:15:24] in this ministry
[1:15:26] had an open portion
[1:15:29] and he had a sealed portion in his
[1:15:32] ministry
[1:15:34] but there's not time to get into it
[1:15:37] but we're going to touch it a bit
[1:16:13] healing campaigns
[1:17:06] just a little rim of hair around his
[1:17:09] head
[1:17:12] no preachers
[1:17:39] and they had a have a conference up
[1:17:41] there on account of not having it in the
[1:17:43] South because they they had both colored
[1:17:45] and white together
[1:17:52] and this old fellow was standing there
[1:18:05] and all the ministers that they have
[1:18:07] been preaching on what Jesus done and so
[1:18:09] forth
[1:18:13] but he never take it he took the text
[1:18:16] over in job
[1:18:18] somewhere there where it said
[1:18:23] where were you when I laid the
[1:18:25] foundations of the world
[1:18:28] and when the morning Stars sang together
[1:18:33] and the sons of God shouted for Joy
[1:18:35] president
[1:18:40] well where the ministers was bringing
[1:18:42] the activities of the church on Earth
[1:18:46] he went up to the heavens
[1:18:54] Plumbing back downtown Millions years
[1:18:56] before the world was even foreign
[1:18:59] [Music]
[1:19:48] but he was a fountain of seven colors
[1:19:52] because there's a rainbow in heaven 38
[1:20:31] what was that when I lay the foundations
[1:20:33] of the earth declare if thou has
[1:20:35] understanding
[1:20:40] who has laid the measures thereof
[1:20:42] without knows or who had stretched the
[1:20:44] line upon it is
[1:20:49] all the foundations therefore fast and
[1:20:52] who lay the Cornerstone thereof okay
[1:20:55] there's two portions of redemption
[1:20:58] there's a Cornerstone yeah and there's
[1:21:01] the headstone
[1:21:03] foreign
[1:21:43] it's also called the constellation
[1:21:46] of Seven Sisters
[1:22:19] did they form One Cloud
[1:22:57] here came a flood at Jeffersonville in
[1:23:00] Jeffersonville
[1:23:08] during that time of the floods
[1:23:13] because he reject to receive that open
[1:23:15] portion in Grace I am now there's
[1:23:20] bitterness
[1:23:22] that a Christian has to go through
[1:23:26] and that open Ministry that brother
[1:23:28] Branham
[1:24:02] you turn to you who turn judgment to
[1:24:06] Wormwood and leave of righteousness
[1:24:08] leave off righteousness in the earth
[1:24:11] is
[1:24:15] but it's also an angel
[1:24:43] for the Waters of the sea and pour them
[1:24:45] out upon the face of the earth now
[1:24:48] if you search the message
[1:24:54] now the angel that started began the
[1:24:57] flood there with Noah
[1:24:59] was
[1:25:04] bitter Waters
[1:25:07] now the Bible says in Revelations 8 11.
[1:25:09] this is
[1:25:18] and the name of the star is called
[1:25:21] wormwood and the third part of the
[1:25:23] waters became wormwood and many men died
[1:25:25] of the waters because they were made
[1:25:27] bitter
[1:25:28] avier
[1:25:30] so the open portion of the ministry of
[1:25:33] brother Branham
[1:25:34] he went through bitter Waters
[1:25:39] because he first rejected to fulfill
[1:25:42] that portion
[1:25:44] but there's another bitterness on that
[1:25:48] sealed portion
[1:25:49] but the bitterness
[1:25:53] it should not hold you back
[1:25:56] there will always be bitterness
[1:26:02] but these bitterness or trials that come
[1:26:05] to your life
[1:26:08] because you accepted the blood of Jesus
[1:26:10] Christ you accepted the rainbow you have
[1:26:14] said that the Covenant you accepted his
[1:26:17] grace
[1:26:18] and being that you accepted
[1:26:21] the Devon comes with his bitterness
[1:26:31] to serve God
[1:26:35] bitterness will come
[1:26:38] now there are two portions there's two
[1:26:41] rainbows
[1:26:42] the first rainbow
[1:26:45] of the seven churches
[1:26:51] are the Seven Seals
[1:26:54] immediately
[1:26:55] is
[1:26:58] this item in his office
[1:27:02] if you notice it's
[1:27:05] in the form of a rainbow
[1:27:08] in form of a bow or an arch
[1:27:12] there's two portions like brother
[1:27:15] Branham says there's
[1:27:19] two halves two halves
[1:27:22] this is a complete circle
[1:27:25] now the first half is on the earth
[1:27:29] that's why we can all see it
[1:27:32] but the second half
[1:27:34] it's not on Earth it's in the heavens
[1:27:47] but it's half of a complete circle
[1:27:51] it's not all of it
[1:27:56] now this this candlesticks solamente is
[1:28:02] one half of the Redemption
[1:28:05] there's a second half she said
[1:28:09] the last time that I spoke
[1:28:13] we spoke about the Holy place and the
[1:28:15] holies of holies
[1:28:16] now this is in the Holy place
[1:28:20] now the other rainbow is
[1:28:25] there around the Throne of God and those
[1:28:28] gracias there's two Grace
[1:28:31] Grace
[1:28:52] not everyone would be raptured
[1:28:56] not everyone can benefit from that Grace
[1:29:00] portion
[1:30:14] and as you know it's just a
[1:30:16] manifestation of the seven and angels of
[1:30:18] the seven churches
[1:30:21] but there are seven other seals
[1:30:26] that's on the back side of the book it's
[1:30:29] outside the Bible
[1:30:32] if you read in Revelations
[1:30:35] says the book was
[1:30:37] still from in and out in Jeremiah this
[1:30:41] is
[1:30:42] it's an open letter
[1:30:45] and it's a sealed letter
[1:30:47] now there's two portions
[1:30:55] now this this candlesticks now that's
[1:30:59] only one half
[1:31:00] La salvation Salvation is
[1:31:04] now these candlesticks are it's the
[1:31:06] rainbow you know
[1:31:08] the one could see from here on Earth
[1:31:10] this is
[1:31:14] the message I think a man's filter
[1:31:19] one day he was out there in nature yeah
[1:31:21] this is
[1:31:26] what happened up there when the angels
[1:31:28] of the Lord appeared to me one morning
[1:31:29] yes
[1:31:32] and then squirrels were spoken to
[1:31:34] existence
[1:31:36] all of you remember when it was taking
[1:31:38] place
[1:31:41] and also just at top of the hill where I
[1:31:43] was standing
[1:31:47] was where just before preaching the
[1:31:49] seven Church ages
[1:31:58] I thought the sun was coming up
[1:32:17] candlesticks standing upon there on top
[1:32:19] of the hill come on
[1:32:21] you're worth like a rainbow
[1:32:24] Traverse
[1:32:27] was coming up through the pipes and
[1:32:30] feeding out
[1:32:32] so the seven churches
[1:32:35] like here like it's represented here
[1:32:37] these candlesticks it's the first
[1:32:39] rainbow
[1:32:40] it's here on Earth
[1:32:43] everyone can see this rainbow
[1:32:46] now if it will rain today
[1:32:50] we can all see the rainbow
[1:32:53] who produces who makes that rainbow dios
[1:32:56] God does it
[1:32:58] everyone can see that rainbow
[1:33:01] creentes Believers Incredibles and
[1:33:03] unbelievers
[1:33:05] but there's a second rainbow
[1:33:07] not everyone can see that one
[1:33:11] remember in your heart
[1:33:16] you can reflect the both portions in
[1:33:19] your heart
[1:33:21] you reflect the Covenant
[1:33:24] you reflect the rainbows
[1:33:27] in your heart
[1:33:30] one person can have both portions
[1:33:34] now
[1:33:39] in Isaiah 30 26
[1:33:42] this is
[1:33:57] more of the light of the moon shall be
[1:33:59] as the light of the sun and the light of
[1:34:01] the sun shall be Sevenfold as the light
[1:34:03] of seven days and the day of the light
[1:34:05] the day of the Lord binded up the bridge
[1:34:08] of his people and healeth the stroke of
[1:34:10] their wound all right
[1:34:14] several years
[1:34:18] we spoke about the lunar or the rainbow
[1:34:21] of the Moon
[1:34:22] La Luna the Moon
[1:34:24] it brings forth life
[1:34:29] it has capacity to make or bring forth
[1:34:32] the rainbow
[1:34:35] this is the seven Church ages
[1:34:38] and it talks about seven moons
[1:34:42] the light of the moon
[1:34:44] it's not its own life it's the light of
[1:34:48] the sun
[1:34:49] Jesus Christ is the son
[1:34:52] the the church is the Moon
[1:35:05] here on Earth
[1:35:08] but remember there's another rainbow
[1:35:12] so let's read on the second rainbow in
[1:35:16] Apocalypse and Revelations 4 El
[1:35:18] versicolono verse one this is
[1:35:31] after this I looked and behold the door
[1:35:34] was open in heaven and the first voice
[1:35:35] which I heard was as they were a trumpet
[1:35:38] talking with me which said come up
[1:35:39] hither and I will show thee things which
[1:35:42] must be here Hereafter yeah
[1:35:45] and I wish you all know
[1:35:48] by now that the first verse is the
[1:35:50] rapture amen amen
[1:35:54] because Christ is the door
[1:35:57] the voice that he uses is voice of
[1:36:01] Archangel the trumpet is what calls it
[1:36:05] up
[1:36:06] so verse one is the rapture
[1:36:09] the first rainbow
[1:36:14] Esther in heaven
[1:36:18] but to be able to see the second rainbow
[1:36:21] one has to go up to heaven
[1:36:24] to see the second rainbow
[1:36:27] it requires a rapture
[1:36:31] now even in the natural
[1:36:34] s the rainbows that we see
[1:36:39] we're going to see one half
[1:36:41] because we're here on Earth but
[1:36:47] if you go up high up in their in the
[1:36:50] skies
[1:36:51] it's like there's there's Pilots that
[1:36:54] have seen Pilots
[1:36:57] airplane pilots that I've seen a
[1:37:00] complete rainbow
[1:37:03] why because they're so high up in the
[1:37:05] skies
[1:37:17] you can see a complete circle
[1:37:24] to see the rainbows of the seven
[1:37:26] churches
[1:37:29] to see the
[1:37:32] second half of the rainbow
[1:37:35] he had to come up higher he had to be
[1:37:38] raptured
[1:37:47] of the rainbow
[1:37:50] that's why brother Branham was raptured
[1:37:55] when that rainbow came
[1:37:58] because it was that sealed portion of
[1:38:02] God's covenants
[1:38:07] of God's covenant is
[1:38:11] Rapture in Greece
[1:38:14] not everyone can receive that portion
[1:38:16] solo La Novia only the bride
[1:38:20] that's why a human being
[1:38:23] that's part of the Bride
[1:38:27] Can reflect both portions through their
[1:38:30] hearts like brother Branham
[1:38:32] since he had both Graces
[1:38:36] he could give the grace of Salvation
[1:38:39] because God
[1:38:42] healing Resurrection resurrection
[1:38:46] of all those things that we just
[1:38:48] finished speaking about
[1:38:52] well that's why not everyone can see the
[1:38:54] second half of the rainbow foreign
[1:39:19] in your heart
[1:39:29] in Revelation chapter
[1:39:31] two
[1:39:42] and immediately I was in the spirit and
[1:39:44] behold a throne was set in heaven and at
[1:39:46] once sat on the throne
[1:39:59] and he said was look up when he said it
[1:40:03] would look like a pond like a Jasper and
[1:40:05] starting Stone and there was a rainbow
[1:40:07] round about the throne and sight like
[1:40:09] upon onto Emerald
[1:40:12] it was a complete rainbow
[1:40:15] it wasn't just one half this is
[1:40:19] a rainbow around about The Throne
[1:40:23] I have an image where it shows
[1:40:29] it shows a complete rainbow
[1:40:32] instrumental
[1:40:34] that one
[1:40:38] but this one you have to see it in an
[1:40:40] elevated position
[1:40:41] not everyone
[1:40:45] can see a complete false rainbows
[1:40:51] not everyone can receive both portions
[1:40:56] by the God's grace
[1:40:58] it has both Graces
[1:41:14] it has the first half and the second
[1:41:18] half
[1:41:21] this is
[1:41:25] Revelation chapter 4 part 2.
[1:41:31] now if you notice seven watch seven
[1:41:34] rainbows seven colors
[1:41:37] I mean I mean I want to say seven color
[1:41:40] rainbows
[1:41:42] that meant seven bows
[1:41:47] seven churches reflecting seven lights
[1:41:52] each light wrapped into into the other
[1:41:55] one
[1:41:56] it started off with the red is
[1:42:00] red after red come orange
[1:42:04] which is a reflection of red this
[1:42:06] President
[1:42:07] is
[1:42:15] which is red and orange mixed together
[1:42:22] green and blue makes black indigo then
[1:42:26] comes Indigo you know
[1:42:29] then from Indigo come Violet
[1:42:32] which is part of blue Allelujah no
[1:42:35] buenos Hallelujah don't you see it
[1:42:38] is
[1:42:48] a covenant that through seven Church
[1:42:50] ages
[1:42:53] seven colors that he will save the Earth
[1:42:58] we got the first portion of the rainbow
[1:43:01] with the seven Church ages it's
[1:43:04] salvation
[1:43:05] the second portion is
[1:43:08] Rapture in Greece
[1:43:12] what would he do recorded
[1:43:15] remember he made it with it with it on
[1:43:18] the Earth
[1:43:47] it's half of a circle
[1:44:15] he covered the Earth just makes an ark
[1:44:18] solo is
[1:44:20] just half of it is
[1:44:24] that's the church ages
[1:44:28] oh when John saw him in that Amber color
[1:44:31] amber the color amber
[1:44:36] Alo he's surrounded and covered around
[1:44:38] like a Halo
[1:45:39] now this candlesticks
[1:45:47] are The Messengers
[1:45:50] now there's an eighth
[1:46:01] he's of those eighth
[1:46:04] number eight is
[1:46:06] number of Eternity
[1:46:11] so then the eighth messenger
[1:46:15] has to come from eternity
[1:46:18] because the messengers
[1:46:20] were born from Earth is
[1:46:28] not born from the earth Came From Heaven
[1:46:32] Christ
[1:46:40] but the word that he brings is
[1:46:45] a complete circle
[1:46:49] so you believe in the eighth messenger
[1:46:51] it's a human being no it's not so Cristo
[1:46:55] Christ is
[1:46:58] the eighth messenger
[1:47:08] that he calls it the age of the Bride
[1:47:25] our soul is already there in eternity
[1:47:29] you reflect las dos gracias both Graces
[1:47:35] but your body it's still here on Earth
[1:48:03] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[1:48:05] and left foot upon the Earth
[1:48:10] that book has two portions
[1:48:24] and the voice which I heard from Heaven
[1:48:26] spoke to me unto me again and said go
[1:48:28] and take the little book which is open
[1:48:30] in the hand of the Angel which standeth
[1:48:32] upon the sea and upon the Earth if this
[1:48:35] is
[1:48:41] and
[1:48:43] said unto him give me the little book
[1:48:45] and he said unto me take it and eat it
[1:48:47] up and it shall make thy belly bitter
[1:48:49] but in thy mouth sweet as honey
[1:48:54] how can one person have both portions
[1:48:57] eating the book
[1:49:01] make your belly bitter
[1:49:04] and that seal portion the administrative
[1:49:06] and the ministry of brother Branham
[1:49:09] he had another bitterness is
[1:49:26] of his belly
[1:49:29] foreign
[1:49:46] was raptured
[1:49:51] ultimasita now one last quote
[1:49:55] the sudden sugar going away of the
[1:49:57] church
[1:49:58] if you can please stand
[1:50:12] before reading the quote
[1:50:17] I've always said that in your heart
[1:50:21] you can have both rainbows
[1:50:25] the most detailed message
[1:50:30] concerning the rainbow
[1:50:32] Lo hablo el primero
[1:50:35] Uno and the first of January of 1961.
[1:51:15] so there's a pastor asked if I could
[1:51:17] speak to the church
[1:51:44] two rainbows came here to Phoenix
[1:51:47] that was number five
[1:51:52] in the afternoon
[1:51:55] two rainbows appeared here in the city
[1:51:57] of Phoenix
[1:51:59] I'm not sure those who are here remember
[1:52:01] yes and those two rainbows
[1:52:06] those two rainbows appeared over the
[1:52:08] tomb of brother Johnny
[1:52:10] I have some images that they can please
[1:52:12] place it
[1:52:39] there is a
[1:52:42] Rapture in Grace
[1:52:49] going away of the church
[1:52:51] this is
[1:52:55] now let us take the way with the Lords
[1:52:58] the spies the few
[1:53:00] years

[1:53:06] neighborhood Entre Las personas amongst
[1:53:09] the people Iglesia amongst the church or
[1:53:12] wherever it is
[1:53:15] that has nothing to do with us
[1:53:20] we shall not the file our garments with
[1:53:23] the things of the world
[1:53:26] for you shall come and someday in a
[1:53:28] moment

[1:53:37] church
[1:53:39] you'll be coming over the hill of time
[1:53:45] down the horizontal rainbow to take away
[1:53:48] the church
[1:54:09] you can have both portions
[1:54:21] because that's only for a small amount
[1:54:23] of time
[1:54:24] let us pray
[1:54:27] Heavenly Father
[1:54:30] Lord we give you thanks for those
[1:54:32] rainbows Lord
[1:54:34] is

[1:54:41] to not reject your Covenant
[1:54:44] do not reject your grace
[1:54:47] as we advance more and more
[1:54:51] we're going to that open portion
[1:54:54] that's available to the whole world
[1:54:57] we're going to that sealed portion
[1:55:01] that is only for your selected bride
[1:55:06] that those bitterness Lord may not
[1:55:08] unmotivate us
[1:55:09] [Music]
