[1:26:49] lavados de la sangre del Calvario
[1:26:56] hermano no tomamos ese privilegio a la
[1:27:02] ligera en esta mañana estamos pidiendo
[1:27:04] el favor de
[1:27:06] Dios dice el hermano
[1:27:09] branam que el don de
[1:27:13] Dios no es el don de
[1:27:18] predicar es de hacerse uno a un lado
[1:27:21] para que él trabaje
[1:27:24] y Ese es nuestro deseo esta
[1:27:28] mañana que Dios le hable a usted por su
[1:27:33] palabra los cielos y la tierra
[1:27:35] [Música]

[1:28:13] era y siempre aprecié su posición en lo
[1:28:17] que es la palabra de
[1:28:23] Dios llevar al hermano a
[1:28:27] casa pero la obra
[1:28:30] continúa Que Dios bendiga a cada uno de
[1:28:34] ustedes por mantener las puertas
[1:28:39] abiertas a este Faro de la
[1:28:41] comunidad
[1:28:46] en Dios benda Quiero agradecer todos
[1:28:58] yo me propuse de no anunciar la reunión
[1:29:02] esta ahí del púlpito cuando estaba

[1:29:30] a tocar los
[1:29:32] instrumentos yo s que si
[1:29:37] hay sabes lo que dijo el hermano
[1:29:41] bram en el lugar proveo de Dios para la
[1:29:46] adoración dice ahí es donde colocó su
[1:29:50] nombre dice que no es en ninguna iglesia
[1:29:53] en particular

[1:30:01] aho su nombre en
[1:30:04] Cristo yo es su
[1:30:09] palabra y dice la palabra donde est
[1:30:12] dos congregados en mi
[1:30:15] nombre ahí estoy en su medio

[1:30:47] versos verso 20 y 21
[1:30:54] mientras leemos el texto en esta
[1:31:00] mañana nos vamos a referir si el señor
[1:31:03] nos
[1:31:06] ayuda referencia a la
[1:31:10] escritura y por supuesto las
[1:31:12] declaraciones del profeta
[1:31:14] mensajero ahora hermano y
[1:31:19] hermana yo creo que El mensajero de la
[1:31:22] séptima edad
[1:31:25] es el profeta vindicado a nuestra
[1:31:32] edad en la escritura de Tesalonicenses
[1:31:36] 4
[1:31:41] 16 el hermano ha referencia la escritura
[1:31:44] en el mensaje rapto
[1:31:57] con la voz del Arcángel y la trompeta de
[1:32:01] Dios dice que Jesús hace las
[1:32:05] tres mientras está descendiendo
[1:32:08] antes de su
[1:32:11] aparición Qué es la
[1:32:14] aclamación es un
[1:32:17] mensaje un mensajero con un
[1:32:20] mensaje para llamar a la novia
[1:32:25] hermano este mensaje no es el mensaje de
[1:32:27] un
[1:32:29] hombre Dios usó un hombre
[1:32:33] redimido para
[1:32:35] hablarlo pero este
[1:32:38] mensaje es el señor
[1:32:43] mismo Así es como lo creemos esta
[1:32:46] mañana mi
[1:32:48] hermano si hubiésemos vivido en el
[1:32:50] tiempo de Noé
[1:32:54] hubiese tenido uno extra en su
[1:32:59] arca si hubiéramos vivido en los días de
[1:33:03] Jesús hubiese más de 12
[1:33:07] discípulos pero este es nuestro
[1:33:10] [Aplausos]
[1:33:11] día lo que usted está haciendo
[1:33:14] hoy es lo que usted hubiera hecho
[1:33:18] allá este es nuestro tiempo de
[1:33:21] viar este es nuestro día y su
[1:33:25] mensaje y no nos avergonzamos de
[1:33:28] él no nos avergüenza de
[1:33:31] decirle lo que dijo el hermano
[1:33:34] branam Gloria a Dios Dios le bendiga Me
[1:33:37] siento
[1:33:41] bien Juan capítulo
[1:33:44] 16 de cierto de
[1:33:46] cierto os digo que digo
[1:33:53] lloraréis y
[1:33:56] lamentaréis y el mundo se
[1:34:00] alegrará pero aún vosotros estéis
[1:34:06] tristes vuestra tristeza se convertirá
[1:34:09] en gozo me gusta
[1:34:14] eso la mujer cuando da a luz tiene
[1:34:19] dolor porque ha llegado su hora
[1:34:26] pero después que ha dado
[1:34:30] luz ya no se acuerda de la
[1:34:35] angustia porque el gozo de que haya
[1:34:38] nacido un hombre en el
[1:34:42] mundo vamos a dirigirnos al autor por un
[1:34:47] momento gracioso padre
[1:34:50] celestial cuánto te agradecemos en esta
[1:34:52] mañana
[1:34:54] de la profundidad del
[1:34:58] corazón por el gran privilegio que nos
[1:35:00] has
[1:35:02] permitido de reunirnos en este
[1:35:06] lugar pero no en vano
[1:35:11] señor porque te estamos adorando a ti
[1:35:14] por tu
[1:35:16] gracia en espíritu y en verdad
[1:35:26] ahora señor pedimos tus
[1:35:28] bendiciones sobre la palabra de
[1:35:32] Dios porque podemos voltear las páginas
[1:35:35] de la
[1:35:37] Biblia podemos leer las Santas
[1:35:42] Escrituras pero solamente tú puedes dar
[1:35:45] revelación Divina de la
[1:35:47] palabra y la manera que lo has
[1:35:51] ordenado es
[1:35:57] mientras la palabra de Dios Se
[1:35:59] predica pedimos tu favor en esta
[1:36:02] mañana que la
[1:36:05] Vivi por tu
[1:36:08] presencia al corazón de tus
[1:36:11] hijos porque nos encomendamos a ti cada
[1:36:15] uno en tus
[1:36:18] manos para tu honra y tu gloria
[1:36:23] nombre del señor
[1:36:25] Jesucristo y dice el pueblo de Dios Amén
[1:36:29] pueden tomar su
[1:36:33] lugar Pueden decir Gloria a
[1:36:37] Dios Ahora voy a estar leyendo esta
[1:36:40] mañana al
[1:36:43] empezar del mensaje de dolores de
[1:36:48] parto Este es el texto que usó el
[1:36:50] hermano branam
[1:36:54] en esta lección tan
[1:36:57] tremenda y ahora en este
[1:37:00] mensaje es muy impactante para
[1:37:04] m esto se predicó en
[1:37:09] 1965 en el Ministerio ya tardío del
[1:37:11] hermano
[1:37:13] branam se le intit dolores de
[1:37:18] parto y antes de
[1:37:22] estee de
[1:37:25] 1961 El Hermano Branham
[1:37:29] predicó es menester nacer de
[1:37:33] nuevo El Hermano Branham a través de su
[1:37:36] ministerio
[1:37:40] constantemente se refería a este nuevo
[1:37:45] nacimiento a esta experiencia de nacer
[1:37:48] de
[1:37:50] nuevo tan significativo
[1:37:53] que nos
[1:37:56] dijo a no ser que usted nazca de nuevo
[1:37:59] usted se
[1:38:01] perderá la primera doctrina de
[1:38:05] Jesús dice es necesario nacer de
[1:38:09] nuevo no que quizás o
[1:38:13] deberías o a lo
[1:38:16] mejor Dice tienes
[1:38:19] que y hermano
[1:38:22] escritural cuando Dios instauró la
[1:38:27] iglesia después de la muerte el entierro
[1:38:30] y la resurrección de
[1:38:33] Jesucristo para esa vida que que estaba
[1:38:35] en
[1:38:36] Cristo para regresar al
[1:38:38] [Música]
[1:38:45] creyente tuvo
[1:38:47] que haber un rendimiento
[1:38:53] tuvo que haber algo que estuviese
[1:38:57] buscándolo Y eso se
[1:39:00] cumplió en esa
[1:39:02] iglesia del ayer en el día de
[1:39:07] Pentecostés hermano y hermana Dios no ha
[1:39:11] cambiado el Espíritu Santo aú es el
[1:39:15] mismo el Cielo aún es
[1:39:19] igual Pedro dio la receta
[1:39:24] aquellos que le escucharon predicar esta
[1:39:26] mañana que cuando cayó el espíritu
[1:39:30] santo le preguntaron Cómo podemos
[1:39:32] recibir lo que tú
[1:39:34] tienes dice arrepentidos cada uno de
[1:39:38] ustedes y bautícese en el nombre del
[1:39:40] señor
[1:39:41] Jesucristo para la remisión de
[1:39:45] pecado y recibiréis el don del espíritu
[1:39:48] santo porque esta promesa es para ti
[1:39:53] aquellos que están
[1:39:57] leos y paraos el señor
[1:40:01] llamase si Dios Aún está
[1:40:05] llamando La promesa es tan real esta
[1:40:08] mañana como fuera aqu
[1:40:11] Entonces ese era el
[1:40:14] tema de malaquías
[1:40:18] 45 de restaurar el
[1:40:21] corazón de los hijos
[1:40:24] de regreso a
[1:40:26] esto de estos padres
[1:40:29] pentecostales quiero hacer una
[1:40:33] aclaración Yo sé lo que dijo el hermano
[1:40:35] bram nos
[1:40:39] dijo que ya estamos más allá de la
[1:40:42] odisea y dice estamos más allá de
[1:40:48] Pentecostés dice que la palabra que cayó
[1:40:50] en pés
[1:40:53] trabajar No va a funcionar
[1:40:56] hoy dice ahora Estamos en la edad de la
[1:41:00] novia es verdad
[1:41:03] hermano como la iglesia del dios
[1:41:07] viviente porque los mensajes de Los
[1:41:09] Cabos
[1:41:10] sueltos se han
[1:41:13] desarrollado somos
[1:41:16] responsables para recibir más
[1:41:19] revelación para crecer aún más
[1:41:23] la palabra de
[1:41:24] Dios un entendimiento más
[1:41:28] avanzado que han recibido las
[1:41:31] otras
[1:41:34] ciertamente hemos pasado la edad de
[1:41:37] Lutero de
[1:41:39] justificación la edad
[1:41:41] de de
[1:41:44] santificación la edad
[1:41:46] pente de restauración de los dones ah
[1:41:55] habrá una
[1:41:57] Eva que no
[1:41:59] caerá ella está completamente
[1:42:03] vestida en la palabra de
[1:42:07] Dios pero quiero que se
[1:42:10] fijen ya pasaron 400
[1:42:13] años de la edad de
[1:42:15] Lutero pero la
[1:42:18] justificación la verdad que
[1:42:21] predicó esta
[1:42:24] como siempre ha
[1:42:25] sido sin
[1:42:28] justificación cómo será
[1:42:31] [Música]
[1:42:32] [Aplausos]
[1:42:34] salvo 300 años han
[1:42:36] pasado de la edad de
[1:42:39] Wesley pero la
[1:42:42] santificación la verdad que é
[1:42:45] predicó es tan real esta mañana como
[1:42:48] fuera aquel
[1:42:50] entonces estamos más allá
[1:42:53] de la
[1:42:54] edad de
[1:42:56] Pentecostés pero la
[1:42:59] bendición es tan
[1:43:01] real como siempre ha
[1:43:04] sido dice el hermano
[1:43:07] bran la iglesia del
[1:43:10] Odisea no te
[1:43:12] comprometas con cualquier
[1:43:15] cosa que el bautismo del espíritu
[1:43:18] santo que cayó en el día de Pentecostés
[1:43:21] [Aplausos]
[1:43:23] no
[1:43:25] permitas un maestro falso que te
[1:43:29] saque de la
[1:43:32] importancia de es asimiento requisito
[1:43:35] del
[1:43:38] día
[1:43:43] entendemos cuando usted escucha el
[1:43:46] mensaje estaturas del varón
[1:43:49] perfecto nombres blasfemos
[1:43:54] hermano tomando segunda de Pedro como
[1:43:58] texto dice tener fe y nazca de
[1:44:03] nuevo eso coloca el
[1:44:05] fundamento pero mi
[1:44:07] hermano no se detenga usted
[1:44:11] ahí dice ahí es donde ustedes
[1:44:13] pentecostales cometieron el
[1:44:15] error nacieron en la familia por el
[1:44:18] espíritu santo pero fallaron
[1:44:24] de continuar con el
[1:44:26] instructor y convertirte en un
[1:44:29] heredero dijo el hermano
[1:44:31] bram en el mensaje la
[1:44:34] adopción tu nacimiento no es tu
[1:44:38] adopción no es tampoco tu
[1:44:41] sello es el mismo espíritu santo pero el
[1:44:46] sello es más adelante maduración
[1:44:57] usted tiene virtudes que tien que ser
[1:44:59] agregadas dijo el hermano
[1:45:01] br en nombr
[1:45:05] blasfemos dice naces a esto naces a
[1:45:08] estot a esto otro a
[1:45:11] esto siete
[1:45:13] veces dice el espíritu santo te
[1:45:18] Sella cada una de estas virtudes dentro
[1:45:21] de ti
[1:45:23] para llevarte a la
[1:45:24] estatura de un varón
[1:45:27] perfecto una mujer
[1:45:29] perfecta por eso mi
[1:45:33] hermano no es suficiente de nacer de
[1:45:36] nuevo usted tiene que irse hasta el
[1:45:40] final pero para poder ser
[1:45:42] salvo mi hermano mi
[1:45:45] hermana escuchamos el mensaje de las 10
[1:45:48] vírgenes dijo El Hermano
[1:45:50] Branham Que la virgen fatua
[1:45:54] dice están hechas del mismo
[1:45:56] material son
[1:45:59] salvas son salvos como usted y como
[1:46:03] yo pero este es el ejemplo que él otorgó
[1:46:06] que
[1:46:07] dio una mujer por ejemplo una costurera
[1:46:10] que tiene un patrón para hacer
[1:46:12] confeccionar un
[1:46:14] vestido ella compra el metro de material
[1:46:18] de ya tiene el patrón para
[1:46:21] seguir la
[1:46:23] tela donde quiere colocar el
[1:46:27] patrón el precio que se
[1:46:30] paga es para toda la yarda el patrono
[1:46:34] herman cuando Cristo fue al
[1:46:38] Calvario compró a los dos
[1:46:43] grupos está constituido de Dos
[1:46:46] clases Mateo 25 no los
[1:46:49] dice Usted tiene virgen prudente virgen
[1:46:53] fatua
[1:46:55] ahora todos los que estamos aquí esta
[1:46:59] mañana la razón que estamos
[1:47:02] aquí es para ser virgen
[1:47:07] prudente me puede decir
[1:47:10] amén ninguno de nosotros nos levantamos
[1:47:13] esta mañana y decir
[1:47:16] amada vamos a vestirnos de lo
[1:47:19] mejor vamos a ir a la casa de Dios para
[1:47:23] honrar la resurrección de
[1:47:25] Cristo y aseguremos noos de que somos
[1:47:29] vírgenes
[1:47:33] fatuas ese no será nuestro motivo no es
[1:47:37] Nuestro
[1:47:38] objetivo y hermano y
[1:47:40] hermana esto nunca va a ser
[1:47:43] popular pero la
[1:47:47] mayoría de los grupos que son salvos de
[1:47:50] cada edad
[1:47:56] el grupo de elegida era una minoría
[1:47:59] siempre ha sido
[1:48:01] así y no cambiará nuestra
[1:48:04] edad Aquí está lo que dice el hermano
[1:48:07] branam la
[1:48:09] virgen se queda por parte de la palabra
[1:48:13] pero no toda la
[1:48:15] palabra pero la
[1:48:17] novia cree y
[1:48:20] recibe cada palabra de Dios
[1:48:25] dijo
[1:48:26] Jesús el hombre no vive solamente del
[1:48:29] pan Pero de cada
[1:48:34] palabra no n más de los mensajes después
[1:48:36] del
[1:48:37] 63 pero cada
[1:48:40] palabra que sale de la boca de Dios
[1:48:44] hermano esta es la boca de Dios para
[1:48:47] nuestra edad
[1:48:56] El Hermano Branham nos los
[1:48:58] apunta que la mujer compra la
[1:49:02] tela la virgen fatua y
[1:49:05] prudente Las dos son
[1:49:08] salvas pertenecen al mismo
[1:49:11] material pero la soberana
[1:49:16] escogencia de la costurera mujer que
[1:49:18] compró el pliegue de de tela es su
[1:49:21] escogencia
[1:49:23] dónde coloca ahí el
[1:49:26] patrón hermano debajo de ese patrón Ahí
[1:49:29] está su
[1:49:31] elegida y lo que los
[1:49:34] separa es una línea
[1:49:38] fronteriza hay una un
[1:49:41] acortamiento usted y yo
[1:49:43] hermano estamos siendo
[1:49:46] cortados Dios está ha siendo
[1:49:49] testigo si usted y yo
[1:49:54] estamos creyendo y recibiendo cada
[1:49:56] palabra dijo el hermano
[1:50:00] bran que tu
[1:50:02] comportamiento te coloca la
[1:50:05] adopción me gusta esta
[1:50:08] parte dijo el hermano
[1:50:12] branam usted no se escogió a sí
[1:50:19] mismo No no mire es lo que dijo
[1:50:24] con tu libre albeldrío
[1:50:27] porque Dios le dio a todo
[1:50:30] humano la habilidad de
[1:50:34] escoger eso se encuentra en la tercera
[1:50:37] esfera el alma o acepta o
[1:50:45] rechaza cuando escuchamos la
[1:50:48] palabra lo que a mí me encanta de esto
[1:50:52] dice el hermano br usted no se escogió a
[1:50:54] sí mismo él le
[1:50:57] escogió antes de la fundación del
[1:51:00] mundo el hermano br Lo coloca de esta
[1:51:03] manera usted lo encuentra en los últimos
[1:51:05] mensajes que
[1:51:07] predicó Unión invisible de la novia de
[1:51:10] Cristo dice ese Gen ese
[1:51:14] germen la Simiente
[1:51:17] predestinada que era usted en el
[1:51:19] principio hermano cuando usted entiende
[1:51:23] que en
[1:51:25] s es un pensamiento
[1:51:28] expresado dice el hermano
[1:51:31] br que hay una parte de usted que nunca
[1:51:33] se
[1:51:34] perdió hay una parte de usted que nunca
[1:51:38] cayó fue el pensamiento
[1:51:42] el Dios tenía la
[1:51:46] habilidad
[1:51:49] su con su
[1:51:51] eleg esto es
[1:51:53] maravilloso por eso mi hermano mi
[1:51:57] hermana usted no lo puede
[1:52:01] evitar cuando usted escuchó este
[1:52:03] alimento de la Águila dice el
[1:52:05] hermano cuando usted escuchó el alimento
[1:52:07] de la Águila dejaste las otras
[1:52:10] cosas viniste la imagen viviente del
[1:52:13] dios
[1:52:14] viviente usted escuch de su
[1:52:18] [Aplausos]
[1:52:22] dice
[1:52:24] ustedes que están
[1:52:27] poseídos con esa porción de un ser
[1:52:30] angelical es tu primera imagen
[1:52:33] creada dice que resistió la mentira del
[1:52:37] y nunca
[1:52:41] cayó hay una parte de
[1:52:43] usted que nunca ha
[1:52:46] caído hay parte de
[1:52:49] usted que se paró con Miguel
[1:52:53] que
[1:52:53] pateó el lo sacó del
[1:52:58] cielo
[1:53:01] hermano cuando el te quiar Quién
[1:53:05] eres tú
[1:53:07] recuérdale de que
[1:53:09] y ayud para sacarte fuera
[1:53:22] del
[1:53:24] diao la única vida que usted y
[1:53:28] yo caímos
[1:53:30] fue esta vida de
[1:53:35] aquí pero por suio
[1:53:38] conocimiento él nos
[1:53:40] predestinó él
[1:53:42] sabía lo que usted haría con la
[1:53:47] palabra miren su ley en
[1:53:51] gesis la
[1:53:53] Simiente produzca después de su propia
[1:53:58] generación tenemos el gen de
[1:54:00] Dios viviendo
[1:54:03] adentro hermano piénselo
[1:54:06] la palabra de
[1:54:08] Dios es
[1:54:11] usted en palabra
[1:54:16] expresada la palabra es una expresión
[1:54:18] del
[1:54:19] pensamiento primeramente el pensamiento
[1:54:23] por eso cuando usted escuchó

[1:58:23] que viene a la
[1:58:25] manifestación recibiendo
[1:58:29] vida de lo que era en forma de
[1:58:32] semilla es

[1:58:58] na es esa palabra que fue
[1:59:01] sembrada que vendrá a existencia
[1:59:10] luz la palabra
[1:59:13] nacer dice traer a existencia
[1:59:25] y
[1:59:25] nacer es el resultado de ese
[1:59:29] proceso Oh

[1:59:35] perfecta la palabra de Dios es
[1:59:39] perfecta quiero tomar algunas
[1:59:46] cosas del mensaje dolores de

[2:00:37] dice la vieja semilla debe de
[2:00:42] morir antes de que venga la
[2:00:45] nueva Por lo
[2:00:48] tanto morir la muerte es algo difícil
[2:00:53] el hermano br
[2:00:56] continúa dice por eso no
[2:00:59] tenemos muchos
[2:01:02] nacimientos nacimientos
[2:01:05] Genuinos Por supuesto mi
[2:01:08] hermano venimos bajo el
[2:01:11] ungimiento Pero recuerde que hay tres
[2:01:14] esferas cuerpo
[2:01:17] espit y adentro al
[2:01:23] puede usted tener ese
[2:01:25] ungimiento y toca tu carne tu
[2:01:28] cuerpo y después se mueve a tu

[2:01:44] lado pero mi hermano mi
[2:01:46] hermana ese nacimiento
[2:01:48] Genuino no puede ocurrir
[2:01:52] Hasta que el hombre
[2:01:54] viejo
[2:01:57] muera y dijo el hermano
[2:01:59] br que se
[2:02:03] pudra no nás vas a morir a ti
[2:02:07] mismo Te tienes que

[2:02:12] [Aplausos]
[2:02:18] hermano aquí es donde todo se ponen muy
[2:02:21] calladitos
[2:02:24] porque nadie quiere
[2:02:26] morir porque eso de morir
[2:02:29] hermano es
[2:02:32] doloroso ocasion
[2:02:35] angustia se lo leímos en la
[2:02:37] escritura
[2:02:40] hermano y ustedes papás y
[2:02:46] mamás cuando el niño el hijo
[2:02:52] elb está a punto de

[2:03:04] tiempo le llaman
[2:03:10] contracciones ustedes hermanas mams aquí
[2:03:12] disfrutar las contracciones
[2:03:25] más intensas se convierten las
[2:03:31] contracciones duran
[2:03:35] más y hay menos espacio entre una y la
[2:03:41] otra por eso mi hermano mi
[2:03:46] hermana Dios no le va a pasar una vara
[2:03:48] mágica para que usted nazca
[2:03:51] cuando usted tiene un pie adentro y un
[2:03:54] pie afuera un pie adentro usted tendrá

[2:04:00] morir usted tendrá que
[2:04:03] [Aplausos]
[2:04:06] morir y nadie quiere
[2:04:09] morir porque da
[2:04:13] dolor a veces nos gusta mejor el camino
[2:04:16] fácil mejor queremos saludar la mano del
[2:04:20] predicador o o unirnos a la
[2:04:24] iglesia Sí yo creo el
[2:04:27] mensaje te voy a decir
[2:04:29] algo también el
[2:04:32] dice la
[2:04:34] Biblia que el cree y que
[2:04:39] tiembla a veces muestra más emoción que
[2:04:43] algunos de los creyentes del
[2:04:47] mensaje no ha nacido de nuevo
[2:04:52] ide de que usted tiene el espíritu
[2:04:56] santo porque usted cree que Dios envió
[2:04:58] un
[2:04:59] profeta eso no es diferente que una
[2:05:02] enseñanza
[2:05:04] Bautista tienes el espíritu santo desde
[2:05:08] que
[2:05:09] [Aplausos]
[2:05:14] creíste el Espíritu Santo es una
[2:05:17] experiencia es lo que dijo el hermano
[2:05:19] branam
[2:05:21] deca la
[2:05:28] Biblia dice aquí el hermano
[2:05:35] br fíjese
[2:05:37] en el nacimiento de la
[2:05:41] Simiente la Simiente vieja tiene que
[2:05:43] nacer hasta que y después la
[2:05:46] nueva Por lo tanto la muerte es difícil
[2:05:49] cualquier tiempo es doloroso
[2:05:53] es tiene mucho
[2:05:55] estrés el nacimiento es
[2:05:58] igual porque usted está produciendo vida
[2:06:02] al mundo está trayendo vida al
[2:06:04] mundo es
[2:06:06] doloroso Mire mi hermano mi

[2:06:18] mundo porque el espíritu del mundo está
[2:06:20] dentro de usted
[2:06:22] usted no lo podía evitar que
[2:06:24] amarlo pero adentro de esa
[2:06:28] naturaleza de
[2:06:30] Dios que está ahí
[2:06:33] adentro pero tuvo que ser
[2:06:36] vivificado ve la mujer en el
[2:06:39] pozo El ejemplo más grande del hermano
[2:06:42] br de la Simiente
[2:06:44] predestinada mi hermano mi
[2:06:49] hermana cre
[2:06:52] sal de que ella pudiese ser novia pero
[2:06:56] Dios rico en

[2:07:09] evitarlo más poderosa que la
[2:07:12] sangre él se te levantó desde lodos en

[2:07:19] mañana porque él nos escogió
[2:07:25] dice el hermano
[2:07:26] bram
[2:07:29] usted escogió
[2:07:31] solamente de
[2:07:34] aceptarlo lo que le haya escogido él
[2:07:38] escogió a
[2:07:39] usted

[2:20:26] iglesia Dice que el
[2:20:30] ruido dice que cualquier
[2:20:33] cosa que ya deja de hacer

[2:35:58] desorden Usted tiene que morir y
[2:36:02] podrirse para que pueda provenir la
[2:36:07] vida y si usted lo hace y toma Dios por
[2:36:10] su
[2:36:11] palabra hermano Él no está obligado

[2:36:21] palabra ya estará usted él obligado a

[2:37:31] desorden la palabra desorden o mes es
[2:37:35] fuera de
