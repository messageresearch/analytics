[43:10] give you the
[43:20] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[43:22] amen amen
[43:29] to start off we'll be reading two
[43:31] scriptures for this evening
[43:33] you can open up with me to the Book of
[43:35] Romans
[43:43] verse 28 to 30.
[43:51] three nine
[43:54] Romanos
[43:56] Romans 8 28 to verse 30.
[44:01] and as you're looking for it
[44:07] I want to thank our pastor for the
[44:09] chance and his confidence
[44:13] he's pleased to me to be able to bring
[44:15] this small thought
[44:26] you should pray for them so everything
[44:28] can go fine for them
[44:36] the scripture says
[44:47] and we know that all things work
[44:49] together for good to them that love God
[44:51] to them who are called according to his
[44:54] purpose
[44:57] hijo
[45:02] para Queens
[45:05] for whom he did for now he also did
[45:08] predestinate to be conformed to the
[45:09] image of a son that he might be the
[45:12] firstborn among many Brethren yeah
[45:26] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[45:29] he also called and whom he called them
[45:31] he also justified in whom he justified
[45:34] them he also glorified
[45:39] now First John 3 9.
[45:52] whosoever is born of God does not come
[45:55] in sin for his seed remaineth in him and
[45:58] he cannot sin because he is born of God
[46:04] may the Lord add his Blessing to the
[46:06] reading of his wording you may be seated
[46:07] Brothers
[46:15] this evening I want to share a little
[46:17] thought or better yet a small testimony
[46:22] about my life and how the Lord has
[46:24] progressively been working
[46:30] I also want to compliment that with a
[46:33] little thought
[46:35] Cristiano which I want to title it the
[46:39] battle of the Christian
[46:43] how many knows that were all in a battle
[46:47] constantly we're battling on a daily
[46:50] basis
[46:51] ever since we get up in the morning
[46:54] throughout the day and in the evening
[46:59] constantly we're in a battle spiritual a
[47:02] spiritual battle
[47:03] a carnal battle
[47:06] [Music]
[47:09] and it's an endless
[47:13] battles
[47:17] spoke to us about the greatest battle
[47:19] ever fought
[47:23] but that great battle it happens Within
[47:34] that war has already ended
[47:37] the second world war has already ended
[47:43] but the the war of the battle of the
[47:45] Christian is one that is Without End
[47:48] until the Christian dies
[47:53] so it's a constant a constant
[47:56] battles
[48:00] so here's a description that I read it
[48:02] speaks about predestination
[48:04] of the children of God
[48:07] and I believe we all are children of God
[48:11] that's why this evening we find
[48:13] ourselves here
[48:17] foreign
[48:41] towns are labeled as a hard place to
[48:44] live
[49:03] but naturally more in the Border towns
[49:06] it's harder to be able to Blossom as a
[49:09] Christian
[49:10] because it's a very hard place
[49:15] that's where I by God's grace
[49:19] that's where I was born and that's where
[49:22] I grew up
[49:24] I come from a family of five siblings
[49:27] five brothers and two sisters he was
[49:31] foreign
[49:42] [Music]
[50:05] so my siblings in average grew up in
[50:08] that environment
[50:10] on the other side of my mom's family
[50:15] my mother was a message believer it was
[50:21] so we would uh be fed by both
[50:24] atmospheres
[50:29] it's just like the children here that
[50:32] learn English and Spanish
[50:34] and they don't know what language lean
[50:37] towards
[50:40] sometimes they speak English sometimes
[50:42] they speak Spanish
[50:45] and that's how we were growing up in two
[50:48] different atmospheres
[50:52] by God's grace and mercy my mother would
[50:54] take us to church
[50:59] and there was a tabernacle there in
[51:01] Nogales that was there
[51:05] and at the age around seven or eight uh
[51:10] we were there attending the church
[51:16] I remember the first time that I saw
[51:18] brother Bernie
[51:21] I was around the age of seven or eight
[51:27] and I believe it was during the time of
[51:30] special services
[51:33] well there was a lot of people there
[51:35] gathered
[51:36] um
[51:38] and I remember that they said all the
[51:40] children up here in the front
[51:44] and I was there and I remember that
[51:46] brother Bernie was preaching
[51:49] and I would see him he you know he was a
[51:52] big man
[51:54] with a very deep voice
[51:59] I didn't see him again until the next
[52:01] time that I came here to the U.S
[52:07] I remember then they played the 20th
[52:10] century Prophet film
[52:13] and I as a child I saw that movie
[52:21] and then I completely forgot as a child
[52:25] but when I came here to the U.S
[52:29] I saw that film again
[52:33] yes so that made me go back to the
[52:36] memory of my childhood
[52:41] and I said I remember seeing that film
[52:43] before and does this uh
[52:46] um
[52:51] the impression that it caused on me now
[52:54] as an adult is that I noticed that
[52:56] children really do catch things
[52:58] and they do learn and they do whole
[53:01] things
[53:03] maybe in that moment they might forget
[53:05] it
[53:08] but when a certain scenario comes up
[53:10] that comes back to your memory
[53:13] is
[53:16] so there we were attending in the
[53:18] Tabernacle that was in Nogales
[53:24] and because a fader I don't know how you
[53:27] might call it
[53:29] the church split it
[53:32] there was a pastor there is
[53:37] brother Bernie was attending to go help
[53:40] the church
[53:47] during that time he said brother Alex
[53:49] burundor the Father the patriarch
[53:52] the the father of the burundas
[53:56] so he can help the the people there
[54:07] so what happened is that the sisters and
[54:09] the majority of the people there they
[54:10] fell in love with brother burunda yeah
[54:14] so I believe that a jealousy came in
[54:19] and because of that I think the church
[54:27] so my mother and I we were the ones that
[54:30] came out of the church
[54:33] and the church lasted a while
[54:37] but after some time it vanished
[54:43] that work there it vanished
[54:50] that building that church building they
[54:52] started using it afterwards as a place
[54:54] where they you can rent movies
[54:58] so I started to think that when things
[55:01] are not from God
[55:02] it's something that just vanishes
[55:07] so we stayed at the church
[55:09] we were left without a church without a
[55:12] pastor yeah
[55:15] and then I started growing and growing
[55:18] up yeah
[55:19] we reach adolescence
[55:26] and then that's when the the struggle as
[55:29] a Christian began
[55:30] [Music]
[55:37] as normally when you get into that age
[55:39] when you reach you know middle school
[55:41] high school
[55:44] that's when you meet the challenges in
[55:46] your life
[55:49] but God's grace the seed was already
[55:52] planted yes
[55:59] and in every step of the way even though
[56:01] I was doing things according to the
[56:03] flesh
[56:05] there was always that inward voice
[56:08] that would tell you not to do those
[56:11] things
[56:14] and but nevertheless the the influence
[56:17] of the world was more
[56:19] stronger in position
[56:29] I started trying new things but I was
[56:31] never a really bad person perverted
[56:33] person trying all these bad things
[56:36] but I was in Dances With Friends
[56:50] and I wasn't really happy doing those
[56:52] things but I just wanted to fit in with
[56:54] the rest of the group
[56:56] just identifying with what they were
[56:59] doing too
[57:04] I remember just because being with my
[57:06] friends I never really liked beer yeah
[57:12] and I could see how they just enjoyed
[57:14] that beer and they would drink it
[57:16] and I wanted to do the same thing is
[57:21] but The Taste was awful and for this
[57:26] I could never manage to get to like it
[57:29] is
[57:32] doesn't matter how much I tried even
[57:35] though I tried really hard I would drink
[57:37] it
[57:39] and drink it again and then my face will
[57:42] get source
[57:45] and I would think how can they light
[57:47] this if the The Taste is just awful okay
[57:52] I just would drink some soda or
[57:55] something
[57:56] and I would still hang out with them
[58:02] and they were just speaking just wild
[58:05] things dirty jokes
[58:07] but I was still there with them
[58:17] by God's grace I never did manage for
[58:21] that to become a liking that I like that
[58:25] smoking the same thing
[58:28] I remember that we would go to high
[58:31] school
[58:33] after we were done with our classes
[58:38] you know there's always someone that has
[58:40] uh there's the sugar it's sneaked in
[58:42] their pocket
[58:47] and I remember that we would go to the
[58:49] back part of the building of the school
[58:53] and we would all get there at like
[58:55] around six or seven of us
[58:57] and supposedly we would start smoking
[59:00] let's start imitating
[59:04] started experimenting
[59:10] and uh and so uh like the word they used
[59:14] here I was a bit bullied
[59:18] even though I was short and my friends
[59:21] were really tall and big it was
[59:27] oh I would bully them and you know I
[59:30] would crack jokes about them
[59:33] and so we would also speak very a lot of
[59:37] curse words
[59:45] I didn't we just all wanted to finish
[59:47] like that we were show-offs big big
[59:50] shots
[59:51] and I remember that I would tell my
[59:53] friends uh
[1:00:00] some would really smoke and others just
[1:00:02] like really quickly would take a puff
[1:00:04] and like uh like they really didn't want
[1:00:06] to yeah
[1:00:09] and so I would say like a bunch of stuff
[1:00:12] and for them to smoke
[1:00:15] everywhere
[1:00:21] struggling with that inward Battle of
[1:00:23] smoking with cigarettes
[1:00:32] one time when we were done and it was
[1:00:34] just me and my friend we were heading
[1:00:35] home
[1:00:41] and so I was talking to him because his
[1:00:43] mother had like a little uh Corner place
[1:00:46] and in that store she would sell
[1:00:48] cigarettes
[1:00:52] and my my friend would steal the
[1:00:54] cigarettes from his mom's foreign
[1:01:04] have those cigarettes they have the
[1:01:06] taste of mint
[1:01:07] is
[1:01:09] he said yeah I'll go check and I'll
[1:01:12] bring them tomorrow and I said okay
[1:01:13] that's fine
[1:01:14] so that happened
[1:01:17] he went to his house I went to mine
[1:01:22] Casa or rather when I was heading home
[1:01:26] and me something in me happened
[1:01:30] I asked myself the question
[1:01:33] why is it that I'm doing this why is it
[1:01:36] that I'm smoking
[1:01:37] why am I behaving like this
[1:01:43] so I promised God that I wouldn't smoke
[1:01:46] anymore
[1:01:48] so with that determination I made that
[1:01:51] decision
[1:01:55] so the next day when my friend brought
[1:01:57] those cigarettes
[1:02:01] and he said look I have the cigarettes
[1:02:03] here
[1:02:05] I said um not anymore
[1:02:08] and he said why I said because
[1:02:14] he just looked at me he didn't say
[1:02:17] anything but you know we just kept going
[1:02:18] with our own thing
[1:02:24] so that's where I think God began to
[1:02:26] work in my life
[1:02:31] like I said Nogales is a tough place to
[1:02:34] live in there's a lot of crime
[1:02:37] a lot of drug addiction
[1:02:39] there's a lot of violence
[1:02:43] [Music]
[1:02:44] the area of the colony where I lived in
[1:02:48] there was around five families
[1:02:51] that would dedicate themselves to
[1:02:54] smuggling drugs or trafficking
[1:02:59] there was around amount of five
[1:03:02] different gangs there
[1:03:05] so I grew up in in that environment
[1:03:09] and by God's grace he took care of me
[1:03:14] and he delivered me from all that danger
[1:03:17] that was around me
[1:03:20] by God's grace we were able to get to
[1:03:23] know the message
[1:03:24] my mother was a Believer
[1:03:28] and my mother has already passed to be
[1:03:30] with the Lord
[1:03:35] and she instilled many things in us she
[1:03:37] would take us to church
[1:03:40] so there as a child I can remember
[1:03:45] all the songs that we would sing there
[1:03:47] yeah
[1:03:48] now coming here to the U.S
[1:03:53] I got to Phoenix
[1:03:59] I was there for 25 years attending
[1:04:02] Phoenix Tavern
[1:04:05] that's where I grew up spiritually
[1:04:10] videos
[1:04:13] and so the church had a split in Nogales
[1:04:15] so like I said we were left without a
[1:04:17] church
[1:04:19] but the sea was already planted
[1:04:24] at the age of 19 I came to the U.S
[1:04:28] my older brother was the one that
[1:04:31] invited me
[1:04:33] he asked me he said would you like to
[1:04:35] come
[1:04:37] I said I said okay that would be fine
[1:04:45] but I still had a year left to finish
[1:04:47] high school
[1:04:53] first let me finish my school and then
[1:04:55] I'll get prepared and then we'll do it
[1:04:57] he said that's fine
[1:05:03] so that entire year passed I finished
[1:05:07] with school
[1:05:08] I got ready either
[1:05:18] and the first three months were you know
[1:05:21] they were good because it's something
[1:05:22] new for me it's a novelty
[1:05:26] uh
[1:05:28] but then afterwards I really can't tell
[1:05:30] something happened in me uh
[1:05:47] and I truly felt really bad because I
[1:05:49] was asking myself what am I doing here I
[1:05:51] can't do anything
[1:05:54] so I opted to go back again to Nogales
[1:05:59] when I was going to Nogales I was very
[1:06:01] happy and glad
[1:06:07] because truly to be detached from the
[1:06:10] place where you grew up it's it's
[1:06:13] Amigos leave behind your family leave
[1:06:16] behind your friends
[1:06:19] and to leave behind the neighborhood
[1:06:21] where you grew up it's something that's
[1:06:23] very tough
[1:06:26] so when I made the choice to go back to
[1:06:29] Nogales I was very happy
[1:06:32] [Music]
[1:06:37] and on the other side of my mind I was
[1:06:40] also saying well I'll take a break
[1:06:42] I'll get uh reorganized and then I'll
[1:06:46] try again and come back you see if uh
[1:06:48] and I did come back he was
[1:06:54] and I did the same thing I was with my
[1:06:56] friends hanging out here and there
[1:07:08] because I knew that I needed God in my
[1:07:11] heart
[1:07:12] and I would never be able to prosper
[1:07:15] doing that uh
[1:07:21] uh
[1:07:23] must must spread this puesta and so at
[1:07:26] this time I came with more determination
[1:07:28] with the more uh with more
[1:07:30] predisposition towards something
[1:07:35] and so I made the choice to permanently
[1:07:37] come here
[1:07:43] it wasn't too tough for me because I had
[1:07:45] a local passport I could come and go
[1:07:47] by God's grace
[1:07:49] pero
[1:07:51] foreign
[1:08:12] and so the the situation got better got
[1:08:15] better
[1:08:17] was
[1:08:23] my parents above all my mother she was a
[1:08:25] very special woman
[1:08:28] foreign
[1:08:29] spiritual she was concerned with our
[1:08:32] spiritual well-being
[1:08:37] my father on the other hand even though
[1:08:40] he wasn't uh you know he didn't serve
[1:08:42] God he was very strict with us
[1:08:44] he wasn't bad he was strict
[1:08:50] personas he wouldn't let us hang out
[1:08:52] with certain people
[1:08:54] to be in a bad company
[1:09:00] when it was night out like around 10
[1:09:02] o'clock
[1:09:05] he would have to go pick us up to get us
[1:09:07] to go in home
[1:09:09] if no if not we would have a bad time
[1:09:13] so he in his own way his own lighter
[1:09:17] understanding
[1:09:20] he also protected us a lot
[1:09:23] my father still is not a Believer
[1:09:27] he's 81
[1:09:32] and I would like to ask if you can
[1:09:34] please keep him in your prayers
[1:09:36] [Music]
[1:09:38] may you please pray for him so God can
[1:09:41] perform
[1:09:46] I believe he's seed that comes from God
[1:09:48] but that still is not manifested in him
[1:09:50] yet
[1:09:53] I believe that the children of God are
[1:09:55] predestinated
[1:09:57] I believe that God
[1:10:00] it doesn't matter where they are
[1:10:03] sooner or later
[1:10:06] that seed has to come to Germany
[1:10:11] sometimes you can see a bad person
[1:10:16] a person that you might say at that
[1:10:19] moment that person's a Christian
[1:10:21] because their life doesn't match up
[1:10:27] but we truly don't know if they're a
[1:10:30] child of God
[1:10:35] the Bible gives us an example of the
[1:10:38] woman that was at the well yeah
[1:10:41] she was an ill-fame woman a harlot
[1:10:45] she was a prostitute
[1:10:55] and because of her deed she was labeled
[1:10:58] as an ill-fained woman
[1:11:02] but what the people didn't know that
[1:11:04] within her lied that predestinated
[1:11:09] so when the son of righteousness the
[1:11:11] Lord Jesus Christ came
[1:11:13] had contact with her
[1:11:17] then that seed sprouted
[1:11:23] so then she started running and you know
[1:11:25] the rest of the story foreign
[1:11:32] on the other side we can see the
[1:11:34] Pharisees the Sadducees and the
[1:11:35] religious people of that time
[1:11:40] we can see how on the outside they were
[1:11:42] very clean and modest
[1:11:44] [Music]
[1:11:47] you can appoint anything against them
[1:11:51] but nevertheless God Christo Christ uh
[1:12:14] on the inside they were just dry bones
[1:12:18] just filled with death
[1:12:58] because we're in a constant battle and
[1:13:00] struggle
[1:13:04] I would like to read it on the scripture
[1:13:10] and galatas it's in the book of
[1:13:12] Galatians yes he says
[1:13:17] chapter 5
[1:13:19] verse 16 to 25.
[1:13:25] this is
[1:13:27] Galatians 5 16 to 25.
[1:13:33] it says this
[1:13:35] is
[1:13:40] this I say then walk in the spirit and
[1:13:43] ye shall not fulfill the lust of the
[1:13:45] flesh is
[1:13:55] for the flesh lusteth against the spirit
[1:13:58] and the spirit against the Flesh and
[1:14:00] these are contrary the one to the other
[1:14:03] so that ye cannot do the things that you
[1:14:05] would
[1:14:06] yeah
[1:14:10] but if ye be led of the spirit ye are
[1:14:13] not under law imanifiest
[1:14:20] now the works of the flesh are manifests
[1:14:23] which are these adultery fornication and
[1:14:26] cleanliness and lasciviousness
[1:14:35] idology witchcraft hatred variants and
[1:14:38] relations wrath strife seditions
[1:14:40] heresies
[1:14:44] foreign
[1:15:03] I have also told you in time past that
[1:15:06] they which do such things shall not
[1:15:08] inherit the kingdom of God
[1:15:11] that's the former life is amor
[1:15:23] but the fruit of the spirit is love joy
[1:15:26] peace long-suffering gentleness goodness
[1:15:28] faith
[1:15:31] [Music]
[1:15:36] meekness Temperance against such there
[1:15:39] is no law
[1:15:43] crucified
[1:15:48] and they that are Inc that are Christ
[1:15:51] have crucified the flesh with the
[1:15:53] affections and lust
[1:15:55] foreign
[1:17:08] something that's why it's it's a
[1:17:10] constant fight uh
[1:17:15] but since we have a body
[1:17:18] is
[1:17:22] and the Bible speaks of the Gathering
[1:17:25] that was demon possessed
[1:17:27] those demons actually do out and lived
[1:17:30] inside that man
[1:17:32] you know the story as Jesus came by
[1:17:35] where he was they used
[1:17:39] and then when Jesus was going to cast
[1:17:41] them out
[1:17:45] they asked they requested that they he
[1:17:47] cast them into those swines
[1:17:51] and because the demons have to have a
[1:17:53] vessel where they can dwell uh
[1:18:11] that's why by God's grace we've been
[1:18:13] able to know this message
[1:18:20] it's a real message
[1:18:25] a message that was bought that was
[1:18:28] brought by God's very own presence
[1:18:30] with signs and wonders
[1:18:34] a Vindicated message
[1:18:40] and by God's grace we've embraced it and
[1:18:43] we're living it now
[1:18:45] [Music]
[1:18:53] currently right now and the planet is
[1:18:56] around six to eight billion of humans
[1:18:58] living here
[1:19:00] billions with the B
[1:19:02] and consists
[1:19:04] due to so many people that there is in
[1:19:07] the world
[1:19:08] and we're just being a handful of the
[1:19:11] brothers uh
[1:19:16] we had the privilege to be able to
[1:19:18] embrace this message
[1:19:21] there's many that won't be able to get
[1:19:23] to know it
[1:19:24] or neither will they accept it
[1:19:28] by God's grace
[1:19:55] you see how there's Wars
[1:20:38] [Music]
[1:20:48] our heads
[1:20:55] that way we can also thank God for
[1:20:57] everything that he has done for us
[1:21:00] if the musicians can come forward
[1:21:04] let's bar our heads
[1:21:07] our heavenly father
