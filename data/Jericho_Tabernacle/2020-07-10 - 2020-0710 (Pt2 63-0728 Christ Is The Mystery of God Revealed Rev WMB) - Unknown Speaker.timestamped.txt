[4:26] [Music]

[4:36] [Music]
[4:45] they were gathered in that upper room
[4:48] all praying in his name they was
[4:53] baptized with the Holy Ghost than power
[4:57] for service came now what he did for

[5:17] I'm so glad
[5:24] [Music]
[5:34] [Applause]
[5:35] [Music]
[5:37] and since he was made all thing made for
[5:44] all of us all things was made far by him
[5:48] then since that is true we should make
[5:53] our identification should be with him we
[5:57] should be identified ourselves with him
[6:00] because he has identified himself with
[6:03] us we should be identified with him how
[6:08] by living for him not just a confession
[6:12] so many people take a confession see
[6:14] I'll say it's got to this place now are
[6:17] you a Christian I'm Methodist oh that's
[6:21] a long ways to me even making yourself
[6:22] known as a Christian I look like the
[6:24] Methodist does I'm Baptist look what the
[6:27] Baptist does I'm Catholic look what they
[6:30] do see but the only way that you can
[6:35] actually be a Christian is for Christ to
[6:37] identify himself in you how we got some
[6:42] a stinger there I hope everybody on the
[6:44] tape gets that to think you say I'm
[6:48] Pentecostal that don't mean a thing
[6:51] it's Christ identified in you that's
[6:55] when he has recognized you it's a spoke
[6:59] of tongues Devils does too I shouted the
[7:03] Muhammadans Buddhas and everything
[7:04] shouts the Indians scream at the snake
[7:06] dance hey your honor
[7:08] they all do cults clans and everything
[7:11] else screaming holiday holler shouted a
[7:13] baseball game but when Christ is
[7:16] identified in you identifying itself in
[7:18] your christ-like which the word
[7:20] Christian means to be christ-like there
[7:24] is your identification all right now and
[7:28] since he is our identification then we
[7:33] should be identified with him by leading
[7:36] for him notice God has had a three full
[7:40] purpose
[7:42] in this great mystery secret God in his
[7:47] great mystery secret that he had before
[7:51] the world began he's got a three-fold
[7:55] purpose in it and now what we want to
[7:57] grow up on this morning is what is that
[8:01] three full purpose I believe by the help
[8:05] of God who's present and he'll show it
[8:10] to us now if he had this threefold
[8:15] purpose we want to find out what is this
[8:18] threefold purpose the first thing was
[8:21] that God wanted to reveal himself to the
[8:26] people he couldn't do it as a great
[8:29] Jehovah God who covered all space time
[8:33] and eternity he could not is too great
[8:36] to ever be revealed to people because it
[8:40] would be too mysterious how could that
[8:43] great beam that never did began that
[8:47] after you went beyond the cycle of a
[8:49] hundreds of billions and trillions and
[8:51] trillions of years of life space and all
[8:54] out into the infinite into the eternity
[8:58] and a great creature that was all that
[9:03] is still in but what he wanted to do he
[9:08] loved fatherhood or he was a father and
[9:13] the only way that he could express it
[9:16] was to become a son a man that's reason
[9:21] Jesus kept saying the son of man they
[9:24] they didn't know what he's talking about
[9:25] many ever but now you get it he wanted
[9:30] to express himself that was this one of
[9:32] these great threefold purposes wants to
[9:34] express himself identify himself with
[9:38] human beings to reveal yourself in
[9:41] Christ secondly to have the preeminence
[9:45] in his body of believers that is his
[9:49] bride that he might live in
[9:52] people now he could do that in Adam and
[9:55] Eve but since separate them so now there
[9:57] had to be some way to get it back again
[9:58] oh oh this this is rich to me just even
[10:04] think of it see see what God's purpose
[10:07] was now why didn't he just keep Adam and
[10:10] Eve like that then he would never been
[10:12] able to express his fullness his full
[10:16] attribute because he could be a father
[10:19] there that's true but also he's a savior
[10:22] you say how do you know what he is cause
[10:24] I've had the experience he is a savior
[10:29] and he had to express that in how could
[10:32] he do it only through Christ how could
[10:34] he be a son only through Christ how
[10:37] could it be healer only through Christ
[10:38] think all things are wound up in that
[10:41] one person Jesus Christ oh my when I
[10:49] think of it I just see the nominations
[10:51] passed off the scene everything you're
[10:52] just going to when I see God's great
[10:55] purpose revealing himself and having
[10:58] first to reveal himself in Christ the
[11:01] fullness of the Godhead bodily and then
[11:04] to bring that wholeness of Godhead
[11:08] bodily into a people that he could have
[11:14] the premises the oversight the leading
[11:16] another other tonight if you didn't get
[11:19] the tape I appreciate one night on a
[11:21] prisoner of Jesus Christ Paul a prisoner
[11:26] see when God gets you to be his prisoner
[11:29] then you can't do nothing but what the
[11:32] Spirit says do Paul with all these great
[11:36] interlinks he taught he was taught by
[11:39] Germania to be a great priest or rabbi
[11:42] Sunday and he had high ambitions he was
[11:46] intellectually a great man great
[11:49] authority great man in the nation but he
[11:53] had to sacrifice every bit of it to
[11:57] become part of the word to express Jesus
[12:01] Christ he known what it was to say he
[12:05] had a notion
[12:06] some place some brother to call him but
[12:08] he was forbidden by the spirit to do his
[12:12] own will
[12:13] oh if if people have spiritual can pick
[12:17] that up
[12:18] hey he was forbidden to do his own will
[12:22] he only could do the spirit for bedmi he
[12:27] was a prisoner to Christ then there's
[12:31] some fortune teller one day who you know
[12:33] Paul no D had power to cast that devil
[12:35] out but he could only do it as God
[12:40] willed it day after day she followed e
[12:43] crying out a dream but one day the
[12:45] spirit gave him permission then he
[12:47] rebuked her the spirit that was in her
[12:49] the he known what it was to be a
[12:52] prisoner Moses he's intellectuals he had
[12:56] to lose him in order to find Christ to
[12:59] be a prisoner then when God got all the
[13:01] world beat out of him and all this
[13:02] mighty man that he wasn't standing the
[13:05] prison that a pillar of fire that day he
[13:07] was found speechless he didn't even
[13:09] couldn't even talk he said God had a
[13:11] prisoner then see you won't try it to
[13:13] your own searching then God had him do
[13:16] this man or dying with power another
[13:19] thing he could go down there and he said
[13:21] Lord I've told Pharaoh what you said and
[13:23] he wasn't there he said then take this
[13:26] thigh Rock God speaking that's God's
[13:31] Word go out there and point it towards
[13:34] the east he called for flies and flies
[13:36] come into creation because he had a
[13:39] prisoner that pharaoh couldn't pay off
[13:42] with nothing nobody else could turn him
[13:44] knowing he was a complete presser in the
[13:48] cheese of god's word bound up only to
[13:51] dust south along oh god can gave
[13:54] prisoners like them now that's when he
[13:58] can express the preeminence insisting he
[14:00] he's got the man or the person so that
[14:03] he knows nothing but Christ you get one
[14:07] of me all right
[14:08] that's secondly first to express his
[14:10] self completely gone in Christ second to
[14:14] have the preeminence by this in his
[14:16] church which is his body the bride
[14:18] - he could have the premise to express
[14:20] himself through them all right and
[14:23] thirdly to restore the kingdom to its
[14:27] riding position that fell by sin by the
[14:30] first Adam back to where you've walked
[14:33] in the cool evening with his people talk
[14:36] with them fellowship with him and now
[14:39] sin and death had separated them from
[14:43] his presence and he's in power
[14:46] expression you read it before the
[14:50] foundation the world to express all of
[14:52] his is his attributes what he was there
[14:56] for if any Trinitarian here we'll just
[14:59] let yourself loose a minute you can see
[15:03] that Father Son and Holy Ghost is not
[15:05] three gods it's three attributes of the
[15:08] same God its expression father he wasn't
[15:12] who want to be a father he was a father
[15:14] he was the son and he is the Holy Ghost
[15:18] and the father the Holy Ghost is the
[15:20] same spirit don't you see you get it not
[15:24] three gods the devil told you then
[15:27] things to make an idolatry out of you
[15:30] it's one God expressed in three
[15:34] attributes to be father to be Savior to
[15:39] be son to be healer see is this
[15:42] expression I want to push just a little
[15:45] bit so that even people listening to the
[15:47] tape will get the idea that can see it
[15:51] would take me around around that clock
[15:53] just each one of those subjects but I
[15:55] hope I make it clear enough that you can
[15:56] see what I'm coming to thank God
[16:00] expressed in Jesus Christ who was both
[16:04] Father Son and Holy Ghost the fullness
[16:06] of the Godhead Bali now the complete
[16:08] fullness of the Godhead Bali dwells in
[16:11] his church the premises all that God was
[16:15] he poured into Christ all Christ was
[16:17] poured into the church the believers not
[16:19] denomination we'll get to that in a few
[16:21] minutes and it'll take it out of your
[16:22] mind forever show you what caused is
[16:25] that by the help of God if he'll just
[16:28] permit it to it
[16:28] what's his purpose now express himself
[16:32] as the Sun see and now that in here
[16:38] might draw the fullness of the Godhead
[16:40] bodily
[16:40] I've got clashes laying here right
[16:42] before me thing that all through the
[16:45] scripture that's what God purpose was
[16:46] then through this life of the Sun is
[16:49] cross the blood it says you're of his
[16:50] cross that he might reconcile to himself
[16:53] about a bribe which is Eve 2nd Eve and
[16:58] God given in a pipe I could hit Moses
[17:01] and all of the same thing he did in Adam
[17:03] and Eve given a type that they were
[17:06] Christ and the bride he is the second
[17:09] dad in the church as the second Eve and
[17:11] as long as the second Eve compromises
[17:14] against the word is she doing the same
[17:16] thing the first Eve did kind of say it
[17:21] well it was for some other age we'll get
[17:24] to that in a few minutes whether he said
[17:26] that it was for another age how can it
[17:28] be another age when he is the same
[17:30] yesterday today and forever
[17:33] but God has purpose that and heated from
[17:37] the eyes of the prudent and wise and
[17:39] reveal it to the predestinated babes who
[17:43] are predestinated to receive it that's
[17:45] reason washed down to the age whenever
[17:47] that light hits something turn it away
[17:48] and flashed it away and great
[17:50] intellectuals and I'm great priest
[17:51] standing there there's rabbis from great
[17:53] teachers authority like the different
[17:56] ones like Nicodemus named the man
[17:58] polished his scholarship
[17:59] you couldn't even understand it and that
[18:03] was great priest stood out there and
[18:05] rabbis you were taught net word my baton
[18:07] noted intellectually and he said you are
[18:10] of your father the devil and it is work
[18:13] she'll do think of it holy man you could
[18:15] put your finger nowhere on their life or
[18:17] their father's life or their
[18:18] grandfather's life or the great
[18:19] great-great great-great-grandfather's
[18:20] live if it did they died and shame is
[18:23] stoned to death but he understands Jesus
[18:26] calling that group a bunch of Devils
[18:29] religious people how Oh
[18:35] the great revelation now now to restore
[18:39] back his kinship
[18:44] to bring back now he had to let them get
[18:46] lost you understand it he had to let
[18:48] them sin
[18:49] put him on Fremont he he could not make
[18:51] them sin and remain God and then
[18:55] punished him for something he made him
[18:56] do but when he put man on partnership
[18:59] with him then let man act as a free
[19:02] moral agent he the same thing he's got
[19:05] you on today
[19:06] see he you act any way you want to your
[19:10] free moral agent
[19:11] so therefore if he put the first like
[19:14] that he has to put the second like ideas
[19:15] put everyone like that or he acted wrong
[19:18] in the first place but everybody is on
[19:21] the same basis now noticing and bringing
[19:25] that back and let that man do that and
[19:28] knowing that he would do it nobody would
[19:31] do it but wanting to do it displayed his
[19:33] answer do that Savior and the whole
[19:36] purpose that is left in Jesus Christ to
[19:40] become God himself to take the penalty
[19:42] of his own law death the died to redeem
[19:46] the life that was lost by rejecting him
[19:49] when Eve went away from the word she
[19:52] went away from her mate and when the
[19:54] church goes away from the word to a
[19:56] denomination she rejects and commits
[19:59] fornication with the world of man's
[20:03] wisdom rejecting the authority of God's
[20:06] Word that sound clear the Bible said
[20:12] committing spiritual fornication any
[20:16] word in the Bible that's rejected or is
[20:18] any self interpretation put to it it's
[20:21] absolutely rejecting and committing
[20:25] adultery against the God that is your
[20:27] husband and an adulteress in every
[20:31] interstate kingdom of heaven we know
[20:32] that now see that's what Eve done at the
[20:36] first place I noticed again now what's
[20:40] this threefold purpose manifest itself
[20:42] in Jesus tries to come into the body by
[20:44] Jesus Christ to have the preeminence as
[20:46] to what restore back eating bringing
[20:51] back that which love that's the only
[20:53] thing out of order all the rest of these
[20:55] things was in order but he had to let
[20:58] put man on free moral agency the fall so
[21:01] that he might be a savior to display
[21:04] what city see his attribute of Savior
[21:08] something had to be lost and the very
[21:10] thing that man fell and become lost he
[21:13] become the savior of that taking his own
[21:15] law and he could not do it is that great
[21:18] Jehovah that covered all his face time
[21:20] he could go in he had to become a man
[21:22] and he took kinship with the man that
[21:24] was lost a man and becoming flesh I'm
[21:32] excited but I'm not something inside God
[21:40] he came from God and he come me to take
[21:45] my sin upon him that he might make me
[21:47] him hey man back to his great purpose of
[21:51] sons and daughters of God for he is a
[21:53] Eternal Father that attribute was any
[21:59] see so if that had to be displayed now
[22:02] see the whole threefold purpose
[22:04] see to express himself he wants to
[22:09] become right the world is lost now he
[22:13] has to express himself in a man to
[22:17] become a savior through the
[22:18] reconciliation of the blood from his
[22:21] cross I had to become that to die in
[22:26] order to save and to bring yourself back
[22:29] into the church to have the preeminence
[22:32] in his church I remember it can not end
[22:36] will not and never will be and never has
[22:39] been a denomination he has to have the
[22:43] parameter system he is the word
[22:48] hey man how can any creepy injected in
[22:53] itself it turns a church into a
[22:55] prostitute
[22:56] to take any man's words of any creed or
[23:00] any denomination if it quickly is marked
[23:02] in revelation 17 as a and harlots
[23:05] the Roman Catholic Church being the
[23:07] and the Proust is being a harlot
[23:09] exactly as clear as any person could
[23:11] read it we've come through the church
[23:12] ages and you see that note those tapes
[23:15] if you desire exactly then anything that
[23:19] jordans herself with a Creed outside of
[23:21] the Bible is the in the side of
[23:23] God done the same thing II did got away
[23:26] from the word which is Christ
[23:27] oh my all right now we see his mystery
[23:32] he had hid in his mind before the
[23:36] foundation of the world I would just
[23:38] like to read a little bit let's just
[23:41] read it if you got plenty time we will
[23:43] read it now let's just all turn just for
[23:46] one reading anyhow to the book of
[23:48] Ephesians and let's begin at the the
[23:51] first chapter of the Ephesians to read
[23:56] an hour as a Sunday School lesson goes
[23:59] on on this tree full manifestation of
[24:02] Christ
[24:03] let's read Paul an apostle of Jesus
[24:06] Christ by the will of God
[24:08] now watch it's not addressed to the
[24:10] world but to the Saints which are an
[24:13] emphasis and to the faithful in Christ
[24:18] Jesus
[24:18] how do you get into Christ Jesus by
[24:21] joining church by birth by one spirit
[24:26] first Corinthians 12 we are all baptized
[24:29] into one body all right that's one he's
[24:33] talking to that any address the outside
[24:35] world we can't talk to the sinner on
[24:38] this cause he knows nothing about it
[24:39] Paul didn't address it to those sinners
[24:41] he said this is two that that group
[24:43] there that's in Christ Jesus grace be
[24:47] unto you and peace from God our Father
[24:48] and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed
[24:50] be the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[24:52] Christ who has blessed us with all
[24:54] spiritual blessings we're about
[24:58] in heavenly places in Christ heavenly
[25:04] places all how I wish had time you've
[25:06] got it marked I hear my Bible about
[25:08] heavenly places what is heavenly places
[25:10] heavenly places just for a moment is a
[25:14] believers position in Christ where the
[25:17] believer stands in Christ in heavenly
[25:19] places according as he has chosen us
[25:22] listen close chosen us in him before the
[25:28] foundation of the world when did he
[25:34] choose us before the foundation of the
[25:38] world when his great hidden mystery his
[25:41] great secret he chose us in Christ
[25:44] before the foundation of the world that
[25:49] we should be holy and without blame
[25:51] before him in what love having or what
[25:58] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[26:01] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[26:04] according to the good pleasure of his
[26:07] will
[26:11] predestinated there's the mystery he
[26:15] before Christ or anything else is ever
[26:19] on earth you sees great mystery and he
[26:22] chose the bride knowing even fall from
[26:26] disbelieving the word knowing as she
[26:29] would fall but he would choose a bride
[26:31] that would not fall that would hold that
[26:35] word regardless of what all the rest of
[26:39] world had to say about it they would
[26:40] hold to that word
[26:43] they are predestinated to stand there
[26:48] the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[26:51] to the church to that great glorious fan
[26:55] now you see his secret what to do you
[26:59] restore fallen Eve as she was a pre
[27:03] figure of the church and I noticed as
[27:06] God opened up the side of Adam and took
[27:10] out Eve by his own flesh and blood and
[27:15] divided his spirit from masculine to
[27:17] finish to finish and put it in Eve took
[27:20] the rib from under his side I may eat
[27:24] out of it so God did the same thing take
[27:28] him out of the side of Christ the blood
[27:31] and the water and Christ is the word and
[27:34] taken the word and making up his Church
[27:36] Eve see back to yourself again you see
[27:47] it now God's great mystery being
[27:50] unfolded that's been hid since the
[27:54] foundation of the world but prefigured
[27:56] it all the way down through how are we
[28:00] find that to heat that he did that here
[28:02] in Ephesians and many other places but
[28:04] that'll give you enough to now down
[28:06] through the ages he has been slowly
[28:09] unfolding this mystery can you see now
[28:14] now down to the how did he what happen
[28:17] in the pre figure now he opened Adam
[28:20] side and took part of his flesh which
[28:27] was Adam to make Eve the bride has to be
[28:33] the word or he is the word she cannot
[28:38] stand on Creed's she cannot stand on
[28:41] denomination she can't stand on good
[28:43] behavior
[28:44] she has to stand alone on the word
[28:47] because she's part of it she was taken
[28:49] from Christ and to be sure that the
[28:56] whole rapture now Luther was a part
[28:59] Wesley was the part the prophets was a
[29:02] part if there aren't a part just in the
[29:05] revelations they was making up the body
[29:07] feet toes arms and so forth until the
[29:09] head which we get to that in a few
[29:12] minutes see that makes the entire
[29:15] rapture it's the body of the word which
[29:19] is crying hey man how does that your
[29:23] loss I don't care how good you are
[29:25] what's your relationship is or what's
[29:27] your fellowship is or what your
[29:28] organization you're lost outside of that
[29:31] word being in you if he abide in me the
[29:37] word my word abide in you then you asked
[29:41] what you will because you in the word
[29:44] the same he has the preeminence
[29:46] he's got the rulership you're you're a
[29:48] prisoner to me the world is dead you
[29:51] have nothing more you see the rest of
[29:53] people living the way they do but yet
[29:54] you do not do it you're a prisoner
[29:56] you're yoked with me my yoke is easy
[30:00] yoke with Christ with his word I do that
[30:04] only which the pleases the Father if you
[30:08] can't believe that I am he then believe
[30:10] the word so perfect notice notice now
[30:16] down through the ages
[30:18] he's been gradually letting us out
[30:21] slowly unfolding the mystery through the
[30:25] prophets and through the times now we
[30:28] can just go on to that expressing
[30:29] himself he spreads himself in Moses look
[30:32] at Moses born in a time of persecution
[30:34] of the children he is born to be a
[30:37] deliverer he was hitting the bullrushes
[30:39] just like Jesus was taken down in Egypt
[30:41] he came out he went up on them out and
[30:43] come back with the commandments Jesus
[30:44] went up to the mountains first sermon
[30:45] Sermon on the Mount come back down with
[30:47] the commandment you ever say them bold
[30:48] times out of Charlotte commit adultery I
[30:50] said you look up on a woman to lust
[30:52] after her has committed adultery
[30:53] lawgiver priest king leader Justin
[30:57] acting expressed itself in Joseph born
[31:00] amongst denomination his brother they
[31:02] hated him without a cause because he was
[31:04] spiritual he saw visions God was with
[31:06] him he could interpret dreams and his
[31:08] brothers hated him he was sold for all
[31:10] by his brother but almost thirty pieces
[31:13] of silver just exactly like him his soul
[31:15] but Judas Iscariot one of his brethren
[31:17] about thirty pieces of silver he stowed
[31:20] into a ditch and supposed to been dead
[31:21] that's right the father and I'm was told
[31:23] that he was dead as told him to this
[31:25] dish taken up and went to the right hand
[31:27] of Pharaoh in the dungeon high suffered
[31:30] there and and there was two saved there
[31:32] butler and the Baker what I'm lost him
[31:34] once a brother now the butler won almost
[31:38] lost and the other stayed just as on the
[31:39] cross when he was in his prison house
[31:41] attacked to the cross for our sins when
[31:43] you become a prisoner one thief was lost
[31:45] and one was saved he just exactly then
[31:48] he become at the right hand of Pharaoh
[31:50] of the king that he dreamed and had the
[31:52] vision he was set at the King's feet and
[31:56] all authority in Egypt was given to him
[31:59] his vision had to come to pass you might
[32:02] have studied of it many times while he
[32:03] was in that prison down there his
[32:05] whiskers growing out and so forth but he
[32:07] studied there someday
[32:08] his vision had to come to pass thought
[32:10] languorous got to heaven as I spoke last
[32:13] night or not before is day night here at
[32:15] the service it has to happen when God
[32:17] says so it's got to happen it's a
[32:19] vindicated prophet and has to come to
[32:21] pass cause it's God's Word and the word
[32:23] comes only to the Prophet
[32:24] the word prophet means a revealer of the
[32:27] divine written word as soon as it does
[32:30] the forth tailor their seer notice and
[32:33] the seer how the one you're telling
[32:36] forth he's divinely vindicated by
[32:38] foreseeing and it comes to pass the
[32:40] therapy one who's prophet will speak to
[32:42] you and tell you certain things go to
[32:44] happen and if it don't happen don't
[32:45] listen to him but if it does happen then
[32:47] I'm with him you better fear Him because
[32:48] I am with you see
[32:50] that's a daggers a vindication every way
[32:51] you know where it's the truth or whether
[32:53] it is God is speaking back through his
[32:54] word to his people by people see God
[32:57] only speaks through man I am the pioneer
[33:00] of the branches a bond doesn't bear
[33:02] fruit the branches talk bears of fruit
[33:05] of the vine notice has always been that
[33:07] way now we find Joe
[33:09] then that when no man could touch her
[33:13] come to Farrell without first seeing
[33:15] Joseph no man can come to the Father all
[33:17] about the Sun I want Joseph left the
[33:20] throne the sound of trumpets every knee
[33:23] bow
[33:23] Joseph is coming forth lorry
[33:27] someday every knee will bow and every
[33:29] tongue will confess when he leaves the
[33:31] throne of his father see to come forth
[33:33] everybody will he's a son of God either
[33:37] he was too late then do it now now we
[33:42] notice that to the types we could take
[33:44] even David as a spoke of a while ago
[33:46] going off his throne rejected by his own
[33:49] people going up the same mountain Mount
[33:52] of Olives as is going over to his prison
[33:54] he was going to his prince the house
[33:57] because he was rejected of his brethren
[34:00] and all these old people he went up
[34:02] weeping that was the Spirit of Christ in
[34:05] him to be rejected as you looked up over
[34:07] Jerusalem and weapons that Jerusalem how
[34:09] awful a rejected King eight hundred
[34:13] years later the son of David stood on
[34:15] Jerusalem up there above the real son
[34:17] rejected and wept over Jerusalem it said
[34:20] now your hour has come
[34:24] although say he's typing just in time
[34:28] but yet the mystery was here then man
[34:30] didn't know what they were doing they
[34:33] only knew that they were led by the
[34:35] spirit to do something now holding it
[34:37] back in the last days for the great
[34:39] revelation but expressing it express
[34:42] himself in Moses and David and Joseph
[34:45] and Elijah and on down through you he
[34:47] could take each one of those prophets
[34:49] and bring their lives on shore to
[34:50] express Jesus Christ perfectly exactly
[34:52] yet never giving his secret in full
[34:56] waiting for make it known in the last
[34:58] days waiting for it to be fully
[35:01] comprehended see before he could express
[35:04] it if he told the whole thing because
[35:06] the Bible is written in mysteries
[35:08] Jesus thanked the Father for the that it
[35:12] was ruled in mysteries now the coming of
[35:14] the Lord is in mystery we don't know
[35:16] when he's coming how he's coming but we
[35:18] know he's coming
[35:19] see and so was all the mysteries of God
[35:22] waiting for this last day atrás already
[35:26] been completed any reveals and shows
[35:28] what he's done although my never gave us
[35:32] mr. evil it's just like this
[35:33] comparing the seven seals now when God
[35:36] used Martin Luther for the coming out
[35:38] for that first church of that church age
[35:40] and want to use John Wesley and he
[35:43] grassy brought them out and was
[35:45] revealing in them that church age when
[35:48] we went goes back to the Bible now I
[35:49] find out but in the last days the reason
[35:52] that was such a cutting of her men
[35:53] disdain that he spoke of hearing
[35:55] shoulder was seven thunders and looking
[35:57] life my life magazine impact that circle
[35:59] a cloud and light there that they could
[36:02] not understand and don't know it yep but
[36:05] here telling go there and wait for these
[36:08] mysteries to be revealed in here months
[36:11] before it happened and then it happened
[36:13] exactly the way he said it would do did
[36:16] you notice in that picture even that
[36:17] arranged on the right when he's being
[36:19] the paralyzed coming down with his wings
[36:21] back his head sitting sideways there it
[36:23] is right there in a picture yes exactly
[36:25] months before two haven't told here that
[36:27] he's going to bring the body of
[36:29] believers together to reveal take up
[36:32] them lost in here come well Luther
[36:35] through he only preached justification
[36:37] just pound it away and that age he
[36:40] didn't know what the age was here come
[36:41] Wesley to it he found his age to see a
[36:45] lot of Al Falls come from it the other
[36:47] churches raised them and yeah come
[36:48] Pentecost patently they organized went
[36:52] right back into death again as we get to
[36:53] in a few minutes right back into death
[36:55] and then comes a revelation of the
[36:57] mystery to reveal what's all been about
[37:01] were these little doctrines like Luther
[37:04] brought out catechism and everything
[37:05] else and Wesley brought this that and
[37:06] the other and these other things man
[37:08] Pentecost brought organization just the
[37:09] same and Father Son Holy Ghost baptism
[37:11] things not knowing any difficult then
[37:14] come back in the last days to pick up
[37:15] all these mysteries and clearly explain
[37:18] it
[37:19] ever repeal it why it's all the last
[37:22] days when this great mystery that God
[37:25] had in his heart is being revealed you
[37:28] get it
[37:29] if you fail come back to this tape again
[37:33] I don't know how much longer I'll be
[37:35] with you remember this is the truth of
[37:38] thus saith the Lord
[37:39] it's the truth it's the scripture like
[37:43] the seven mysteries of the seven light
[37:47] seals and mysteries of them the seals
[37:49] have done been broken ever age had come
[37:51] down and there they left a lot of
[37:53] scattered and God not willing that it
[37:55] should be scattered he comes back and
[37:57] picks up those things those doctrines I
[37:59] started and brought it on how to reveal
[38:01] the whole thing same thing he's doing i
[38:04] and revealing a mystery of Christ
[38:06] Holly was God's three-fold purpose for
[38:09] the church oh my
[38:11] Lydia not reveal reveal Webster says is
[38:14] to make no one make no one an especially
[38:18] Webster says in divine truth that
[38:20] revelation means the revelation it is
[38:24] Christ's way of making himself known to
[38:27] his church how we're going to say now
[38:30] brother bang you're just saying this no
[38:31] we won't say just say this I noticed he
[38:35] made itself known to Peter now if you
[38:37] want to mark this down and we're gonna
[38:39] read it we will read it if you want to
[38:41] and st. Matthew 16 15 and 17 are quoted
[38:48] when it comes to the Mount
[38:49] Transfiguration he says who this man say
[38:52] i the son of man am some says all they
[38:56] think you're Elijah and some says you're
[38:58] one of the prophets Jeremiah sometime
[39:00] but that wasn't what he asked he said
[39:02] who do you think that I am now
[39:04] now there's the church he's talking to
[39:07] what does man think I am today he's the
[39:11] philosopher this social religion he's a
[39:13] good man
[39:14] we believe his teachings right it's the
[39:16] subject to be lived by I think it makes
[39:18] us all better if we did we are to have
[39:20] our churches or so forth that's the
[39:23] Santa Clause like a Santa Clause story
[39:24] it's not expressions of some church that
[39:28] we should express some it's a life that
[39:30] you don't live yourself that he comes in
[39:32] you and lives by itself and you become a
[39:35] prisoner to any human intellectual being
[39:37] at all you're led by the spirit how do
[39:40] you know now you say I might know I was
[39:42] losing my mind maybe a mass losses in
[39:44] mine does that but if you have the mind
[39:46] of Christ Christ expresses himself
[39:47] through you shows that it's him and not
[39:50] you not lost your mind
[39:53] some people under illusions of things
[39:55] goes out and becomes insane well that we
[39:58] know that's wrong that's the devil
[39:59] trying to impersonate the real thing
[40:01] before he gets here
[40:02] always a bogus thing but a real man is
[40:06] to lose his own thoughts and his own
[40:08] thinking not come up blindly like that
[40:11] no sir you come up with your right
[40:13] senses and Christ takes you over and
[40:16] expresses itself and out to the world
[40:18] you're an insane person now if you're
[40:20] insane you're actually insane then
[40:22] there's nothing the devil teeth.take you
[40:24] in complete control you make you do
[40:25] everything contrary to this word but
[40:27] when Christ takes you over he'll express
[40:29] that word I do that cause hits him he is
[40:31] the word then you can see the expression
[40:35] of Christ not some illusion of some sort
[40:37] but a real genuine Christ expressing
[40:39] himself right through you how beautiful
[40:42] how long he said who do you say I am
[40:46] he's asked in the church is 12 out of
[40:48] the millions of that day yes 12 his
[40:51] church in the millions in the days of
[40:55] Noah yes eight and he said as it was in
[41:01] the days of Noah so would it be in the
[41:03] coming of the Son of Man we're eight
[41:06] souls were saved I don't say go be eight
[41:08] say now I don't get that all wrong I
[41:10] never said that I don't know how Mays be
[41:12] gonna be saved in that that's the last
[41:14] moment to do rapture that little group
[41:17] it'll be a small group I'll tell you
[41:19] there or Strait is the gate and there is
[41:21] way but few there will be they'll find
[41:22] it but when the great ransom body
[41:25] through all ages comes up and that's
[41:27] gonna be a great throne there revelation
[41:29] 7 expressive great number which no man
[41:31] could number through all the ages has
[41:33] come up them
[41:34] it's walked in the light of the Bible as
[41:36] far as it was revealed to them and now
[41:38] we know that Wesley had more light than
[41:40] Luther did we know Pentecost outshine
[41:42] Wesley see certainly does because it
[41:44] just gradually let loose as it did down
[41:46] the profits and so forth it was
[41:48] perfectly made knowing the Godhead
[41:50] bodily in Christ and now the Christ in
[41:52] the church is just being made no the
[41:54] whole thing is a revelation of God to
[41:55] take heed back to her right position a
[41:58] game with her husband noticing God is
[42:01] the husband of the church and the church
[42:03] is his bride now Peter when he called
[42:07] said thou art the Christ the Son of the
[42:10] Living God and what blessed art thou
[42:12] simon barjona says which means son of
[42:15] Jonah think blessed art thou for flesh
[42:19] and blood never reveal this to you you
[42:23] never learned it from some school but my
[42:27] father which is in heaven has revealed
[42:29] you notice what he said to him upon this
[42:35] rock that's Peter the predestinated seed
[42:40] of God that had received the slide and
[42:43] giving the keys to the kingdom upon this
[42:46] rock of revelation of who Jesus Christ
[42:50] is
[42:51] he's the full manifested God upon this
[42:55] rock not a Father Son and Holy Ghost and
[42:58] him being the second person upon this
[43:02] rock I'll build my church and the gates
[43:06] of Hell will never shake it down never
[43:08] prevail against it I'll build my church
[43:11] upon this Ark a revelation of Jesus
[43:14] Christ
[43:15] look Christ in you makes him the center
[43:19] of life of the revelation the Christ
[43:25] life in you makes him the center of the
[43:29] revelation Christ in the Bible makes the
[43:32] Bible the complete revelation of Christ
[43:34] Christ in you makes you the complete
[43:37] revelation of the whole thing
[43:38] me what God's trying to do what is the
[43:42] new birth then you'd say brother Bram
[43:44] what is new birth it is the revelation
[43:46] of Jesus Christ personally to you
[43:49] amen not you join the church you shuck a
[43:52] hand you done something different you
[43:54] said a Creed you promised to live by a
[43:56] code of rules but Christ the Bible he is
[44:02] the word that was revealed to you and no
[44:06] matter what anybody says what takes
[44:09] place it's Christ
[44:11] pastor priest whatever it might be it's
[44:14] Christ in you that is the revelation
[44:18] that the church is built upon you say
[44:20] well I'm a Lutheran I'm a Baptist I'm
[44:22] presbyterian that don't mean what don't
[44:25] mean that to God not a thing
[44:27] not a snap of your finger what is it
[44:30] it's Christ being revealed and he is the
[44:34] word and when the word is revealed it
[44:36] expresses itself see that's God's
[44:40] purpose for Jesus Christ was to express
[44:42] himself to take his own laws and live by
[44:46] his laws can and fulfill his law by
[44:50] death Christ God died in flesh in order
[44:55] to condemned sin in the flesh that he
[44:59] might bring to himself a glorious bride
[45:02] redeemed back that will believe only in
[45:05] the Word of God and not swap it like he
[45:07] did for intellectual conceptions of man
[45:10] said that's Christ's idea that's God's
[45:14] idea the new birth reveal system and if
[45:17] a man says he's born again and try to
[45:20] place these promises of Christ in his
[45:22] last days to some other age making him
[45:25] Christ's gesture but not today then that
[45:28] man or that person has been in a
[45:32] delusion by Satan you know that man says
[45:35] that he believes that and it doesn't
[45:37] manifest itself through him Jesus said
[45:39] in mark 16 these signs shall follow them
[45:42] to believe and all the world ever aged
[45:44] casting out Devils and speaking with
[45:46] tongues and and all these great
[45:48] manifestations of gifts that would
[45:50] follow that they shout not pay maybe
[45:52] they ought to they will
[45:55] and heavens and earth will pass away but
[45:56] his word long so it's Christ expressing
[46:00] himself in the individual whether he's
[46:02] intellectual or whether he's he's don't
[46:04] know his ABCs half the Apostles didn't
[46:06] know but they know Christ they never
[46:10] taken heed to Peter John knowing and
[46:12] they had been out of some seminary they
[46:14] said they'd taken heat and notice that
[46:15] they've been with Christ when they
[46:16] healed the lame man thing at the gate
[46:18] they know they had been with Christ the
[46:21] new birth is Christ is a revelation God
[46:26] has revealed to you this great mystery
[46:29] and that's a new birth now why are you
[46:32] gonna do and get all that group together
[46:34] where the revelation is perfectly in
[46:36] harmony and God expressed it through his
[46:39] word by the same actions the same things
[46:41] that he did making the word manifest oh
[46:43] if the church only knew its position it
[46:47] will one day then the rapture go when it
[46:51] knows what it is
[46:52] now notice you say brother Brannon but
[46:55] yes it is - it is the truth
[46:57] did you notice Paul never knew Jesus
[47:00] physically Paul never knew you the only
[47:04] way that Paul knew him was by our
[47:05] revelation by a vision is that right
[47:08] Paul only knew Jesus by the revelation
[47:12] just like Peter did Peter had seen in
[47:15] flesh but he didn't knowing by flesh or
[47:18] Jesus said soul flesh and blood didn't
[47:20] reveal at you he my own life did reveal
[47:22] at youth but my father which is in
[47:24] heaven has revealed upon this rock I
[47:30] build my church
[47:31] Peter did knowing by flesh man walked
[47:34] and handling and everything else Paul
[47:36] had something greater than any other
[47:37] apostles did he they say well I I've got
[47:42] more of a revelation you Paul because
[47:43] you know I'll walk with him I went
[47:45] fishing with him one day I heard him
[47:47] talk you set the boat with me and
[47:49] actually told me let's go over here
[47:50] fishing this place would get more fish
[47:52] and we did it think think we see him do
[47:54] things but Paul saw him after he was
[47:57] dead buried and rose again and expressed
[48:01] himself in the pillar of fire that led
[48:03] the children of Israel
[48:05] knowing Paul being a Jew would never
[48:07] called that Lord and that's either seen
[48:10] the expression he was back the same
[48:11] yesterday and forever he said Paul in
[48:13] other words I'm the same God today that
[48:15] it was Jesse Here I am in the same light
[48:17] the pillar of fire that Moses talked to
[48:19] in the burning bush no wonder he could
[48:21] separate the law from grace over the
[48:23] book of Hebrews he met that same pillar
[48:26] of fire he said I'm Jesus whom you
[48:28] persecute yesterday in the same manner
[48:34] the same pillar of are expressed himself
[48:37] indicating himself to see revealing the
[48:40] mystery of God that's been hidden since
[48:42] the foundation of the world said Paul
[48:47] only Newton doing by revelation Peter
[48:50] doing by revelation he walked with him
[48:52] company therefore you can set this word
[48:54] I just said that he was the word now a
[48:58] scholar can sit down and read that word
[49:00] til he get his tie your mind up in
[49:02] anyway see if he wants to do it cause
[49:05] he's smart brilliant get a Catholic
[49:07] priest we're not so much that there's a
[49:09] real good trained theologian in the
[49:11] Bible rather a Baptist or a Presbyterian
[49:14] or something he'll make you think that
[49:16] you don't know nothing when it comes to
[49:18] talk what see they cause that he has no
[49:23] team in the flesh the word but the only
[49:27] way you're saved is by knowing by
[49:29] revelation if I can take I'm taking the
[49:32] Presbyterian doctrine and tie you
[49:33] Pentecostal you won't know I take the
[49:35] Baptist doctrine and show you pinnacles
[49:38] a million things that you know nothing
[49:39] of right but that's not it that's not
[49:42] his church
[49:43] that's not his church his church is
[49:46] himself revealed man do you sit and
[49:52] expressed by the word itself that he is
[49:56] gone how can you say father son Holy
[49:59] Ghost and be baptized neither me how
[50:05] could you say you know Jesus Christ he's
[50:06] the word when he's not a scripture in
[50:08] the Bible there's not a place where
[50:10] anybody was ever baptized in the name of
[50:12] Father Son Holy Ghost
[50:13] and you and you Jesus only people just
[50:17] using the name Jesus for baptism I'm
[50:19] personally acquainted with four or five
[50:20] Jesus is myself so you see what your
[50:25] denominations lead you into that's the
[50:28] darkness expression of King who brought
[50:31] fruits in instead of blood but the
[50:34] revelation comes to the blood through
[50:37] Jesus Christ who is the blood of God
[50:39] created blood in the womb of Mary and
[50:42] Paul knew him but Rev Li that's how we
[50:44] know him today is only the only way you
[50:46] can know it now say I'm Methodist that
[50:48] means nothing
[50:48] I'm Baptist that means nothing I'm
[50:51] Catholic that means nothing but by the
[50:53] revelation that God has revealed the
[50:56] word to you he is the word and the word
[51:00] how you know revealed it lives itself
[51:02] and expresses itself through you o
[51:06] churches has long forgotten that great
[51:10] revelation that's right
[51:12] revelation of the truth they have
[51:14] forgotten they went them now when Luther
[51:17] raised up he was a great man he had the
[51:19] revelation of that day but what happened
[51:21] a bunch of Ricky's got in flat-topped
[51:23] haircuts as we call it today and Rick
[51:25] aerosol them they got around there and
[51:28] the first thing you know it's there
[51:30] that's precious if you only only knew
[51:32] the numerology of the Bible you know
[51:34] what Elvis are Ricky means into the
[51:36] scripture just like why did Jesus say
[51:39] there's nothing to that your name there
[51:41] isn't that name could only come in this
[51:43] last days for this last days people why
[51:47] did Jesus change Abraham's name to
[51:49] Abraham then Sarah - Sarah why do you
[51:52] change a soul to Paul why did you change
[51:57] the assignment to Peter and so forth you
[52:00] see it certainly means something that
[52:02] name could not be spoken til this day
[52:04] that's reason we got this hellish thing
[52:07] we got the earth today the cause of such
[52:09] things the whole human race is corrupted
[52:12] it's it's gone that's why it is notice
[52:17] now he was all right he was in his days
[52:20] Luther and he had the revelation his
[52:22] cities he left look what he did Wesley
[52:25] had a message look what
[52:26] in the old early Pentecostal head net
[52:28] look what they did they got a bunch a
[52:30] man together it's like exactly the same
[52:32] thing that God by grace sent Israel a
[52:35] purifier a prophet a sacrifice and
[52:39] showed himself among them and brought
[52:40] them out of Egypt across the red seas
[52:43] and they wanted at all so they could
[52:46] have great dignitaries they could have
[52:48] something to do into it and what do they
[52:50] do they was left in the wilderness for
[52:51] 40 years to wonder and not what of that
[52:53] organization ever went over Caleb and
[52:57] Joshua stood out and said we were able
[52:59] to take it look at the Word of God every
[53:02] one of them died in the motors and Jesus
[53:04] said they were eternally gone right
[53:07] actually showed his blessings of power
[53:09] their ages like Luther Wesley and so
[53:12] forth Guinea said our fathers eat man in
[53:16] the woods you said and there are
[53:17] everyone dead that's eternal separated
[53:20] from God their carcasses perished in the
[53:23] wilderness thing they're dead
[53:26] I'm the bread of life they come from God
[53:28] out of heaven they couldn't see it they
[53:30] just couldn't see it all right
[53:32] churches long forgotten they accepted
[53:36] intellectual message intellectuals
[53:40] membership knowledge instead of the
[53:43] revelation of the truth of the word now
[53:46] look here they say today do you believe
[53:48] that God Commission is going all world
[53:49] heal the sick and preach the gospel and
[53:51] cast out devils oh yes I suppose that
[53:54] right but you see a lady told me the
[53:57] other day she said what all the churches
[53:59] aren't harmony I said there isn't one up
[54:01] in harmony with the other there's
[54:04] Catholics standing there I said how
[54:06] about you you're a Methodist Ness
[54:07] Catholic are you harm me in one another
[54:10] I said this Pope countered United
[54:12] together that's a good thing for all
[54:13] that kind of people but the Church of
[54:15] God has nothing to do with it it's out
[54:19] from the whole bunch yes sir you ought
[54:22] to unite that together and one believes
[54:24] in something the other Methodist takes
[54:26] Franklin the Baptist taking Merson both
[54:28] I'm denying the Holy Ghost in its
[54:29] fullness of the power they said we
[54:31] receive the Holy Ghost when we believe
[54:32] the Bible said have you received the
[54:35] Holy Ghost since you believe yeah they
[54:40] say we're the Catholic Church we started
[54:42] early we did this the method say we are
[54:44] based upon the Bible
[54:45] jesus said these signs shall follow them
[54:47] that believe now where's that works in I
[54:52] do should you do also every creature
[54:54] every person who believes any not words
[54:56] of that that's his words heaven through
[54:58] earth will pass away but my words shall
[55:00] never fail now where's it at hey oh I
[55:04] just show what is it it's a hybrid
[55:06] condition look here you take a big fine
[55:09] grain of corn it's high bird and you
[55:12] take a hybrid corn it's a pretty car but
[55:15] you paint it what are you get a little
[55:17] stock comes up like this and turns
[55:18] yellow and wheels down
[55:19] that's why ever denomination is wife
[55:22] hybrid but man's words mixed with God's
[55:24] words it'll come up to the signs and
[55:26] winters and what Jesus said about
[55:27] believing the word it turns yellow and
[55:29] say we can't accept and go back just
[55:31] like all the mother of spies did it what
[55:32] we're looking at Canaan they come over
[55:34] there so we look like grasshoppers Sodom
[55:36] we can't take them the Amalekites oh all
[55:38] these what they're gonna do and they
[55:40] went back and Canada Joshua Ian
[55:42] thoroughbreds
[55:42] a man by the Word of God no God said I
[55:45] do that man they said we're able to take
[55:49] it depends on where you're born from if
[55:53] you're born to the Word of God God's
[55:55] Word has a preeminence as in his church
[55:57] that's what He died for that's his
[55:59] purpose that he might be able to achieve
[56:01] to have his preeminence working in his
[56:03] church that the Word of God shine forth
[56:07] first no matter what anything else looks
[56:09] like I don't care if the intellectual
[56:10] says this tethered has nothing to do
[56:12] with it God's Word said so and we were
[56:14] more than able to take it my five picks
[56:17] at my church to minister told me said
[56:18] I'd be preached into four pokes to the
[56:20] church I said I'd preach that word said
[56:24] so we can do it
[56:28] amen oh yeah the excuse themselves for
[56:32] this see that's why they're blind to the
[56:36] message of the end time this last days
[56:40] when God is proving himself they try to
[56:43] class it as some kind of Spiritist
[56:46] or some Oh what would I call it some
[56:51] mineral an allusion or something on that
[56:56] order see they they try to make it
[56:58] something that it is and just like they
[57:00] did when he was here but Jesus here they
[57:02] called him Beelzebub a fortune-teller
[57:04] now they say it's kind of like a middle
[57:06] telepathy see when they know that he
[57:09] could stand there and look upon the
[57:10] people and discern the very thoughts is
[57:12] in their heart the Bible said so what
[57:15] does not
[57:15] Hebrews the fourth chapter says the Word
[57:17] of God is quicker sharper than a
[57:19] two-edged sword and concerned the very
[57:20] thoughts of the mind and he was that
[57:22] word and when that word is preeminence
[57:24] in the man the same thing takes place
[57:27] again or it is the word Amen see how you
[57:33] to stumble over this from out there so
[57:36] perfectly plain all right that's why
[57:39] they're blind famous was today's crisis
[57:41] on earth come on
[57:43] they staggered the same way they said
[57:45] he's bills above ear they seen he could
[57:47] do it so they said he's just a he was
[57:49] born to the illegitimate child have an
[57:50] odd fella he's just got possessed for
[57:52] some devil he's a he's the Samaritan
[57:54] over there he's got a devil in he met hi
[57:56] does that Jesus said I'll forgive you
[57:58] for that he calling the Word of God the
[58:01] works of God an evil spirit he said I
[58:04] forgive you
[58:04] that Sunday the Holy Ghost will come one
[58:07] word against it will never be forgiven
[58:09] neither in this world of the world that
[58:11] is to come or that great day it will not
[58:13] be forgiven so I see that's written
[58:15] plain in the scripture so when people
[58:17] come to that day no matter how
[58:19] intellectual how bigger denomination
[58:20] they belong to is condemned they have to
[58:23] be they blaspheme the Holy Ghost Harley
[58:26] and Holy Roller in something that had a
[58:28] nun taystee name or something that I got
[58:31] in God's church had to bear it all the
[58:33] time even Paul before gripper sat in the
[58:35] way that's called heresy which means
[58:37] crazy today
[59:09] people say it's a denomination it's
[59:11] Jesus Christ a new birth revealed in you
[59:13] and he has a preeminence is that he
[59:16] might express his words and anything
[59:17] that he's promised in his last days he
[59:19] can bring it to pass through his body as
[59:21] he's working
[59:21] hey man it's just exactly the Word of
[59:23] God made manifest notice me all right
[59:28] same as in the days of Christ God holds
[59:30] a key to this revelation of Christ
[59:32] himself you believe that schools of
[59:37] theology can never find it jesus said so
[59:40] if you want to read it now in st.
[59:41] Matthew 11:25 and 27 I think the old
[59:45] father god of heavens to earth now it's
[59:47] hid this from the eyes or wasn't pretty
[59:49] reveal it to babes such as would learn
[59:51] me see
[59:53] I don't care look at them scholars of
[59:55] that day those Jews very fine man their
[59:59] organizations a Pharisees Sadducees and
[1:00:03] Herodians and whatever they might be see
[1:00:04] all the great organizations that Jesus
[1:00:06] said you're a blind you lead the blind
[1:00:10] well there's this speak of you you have
[1:00:13] ears and can't hear it eyes that you
[1:00:14] can't see cause Isaiah said this in the
[1:00:17] spirit therefore the God of heaven has
[1:00:20] blinded your eyes you're doing like Eve
[1:00:22] did accepting the intellectual side and
[1:00:25] know nothing of the Spirit of God
[1:00:26] therefore folks they all fall in the
[1:00:29] ditch both the leader in the blind to
[1:00:32] the leader will fall with the blind
[1:00:34] cause he's blind also the leader fall
[1:00:37] blind leading a blind they're both fall
[1:00:39] in the ditch and God don't hold this key
[1:00:43] express the same thing in a previous
[1:00:45] scripture that a while ago when I read
[1:00:47] it when he said who does man say i the
[1:00:49] son of man am and Peter said I like the
[1:00:52] Christ the Son of the Living God he said
[1:00:54] blessed art thou simon son of jonas
[1:00:57] flesh and blood never reveal this to you
[1:00:59] my father which is in heaven up on this
[1:01:02] revelation here I'll build my church the
[1:01:06] gates of Hell will never prevail against
[1:01:08] it see now you see so therefore there's
[1:01:10] no school no theologians no teachings of
[1:01:13] the Bible among any school that knows
[1:01:15] anything about it they cannot know
[1:01:16] nothing about it's impossible from the
[1:01:18] annoying thing about it God has hit the
[1:01:20] census of known you from the very
[1:01:22] elected teachers and everything else
[1:01:24] it's a personal individual affair with
[1:01:26] the person that Christ is revealed to
[1:01:28] them if you say he's been revealed to me
[1:01:30] and then the life that Christ produced
[1:01:32] here in the Bible that same life as in
[1:01:34] him does not produce itself in you then
[1:01:36] you've got the wrong revelation if I put
[1:01:39] a life of a pumpkin into the life of a
[1:01:42] pear tree it would bear pumpkins father
[1:01:45] fruits you shall know them exactly right
[1:01:48] it's a first you put out a tree a
[1:01:51] grapevine and it put out a bunch of
[1:01:53] grapes the first shoot it put out
[1:01:54] brought grapes the next you brought out
[1:01:56] lemons the next two brought out pears
[1:01:57] the next we brought out apples there's
[1:01:59] some kind of grafting a fairy in there
[1:02:01] experienced own life over denominational
[1:02:04] bear life of itself but if that ratio by
[1:02:06] never puts out another a shoot it'll
[1:02:09] bear greats like I did the first time
[1:02:12] life the life of Jesus Christ ever puts
[1:02:15] out another body of believers
[1:02:16] it'll bear the fruit that the first one
[1:02:18] did they'll write a book of Acts behind
[1:02:21] me the city wide so you wanna mean you
[1:02:26] just can't get away from it it's the
[1:02:28] life of Christ in you been injected in
[1:02:30] you by the Holy Spirit itself living its
[1:02:32] life through you by leaders of the blind
[1:02:35] notice God holds this key alone no
[1:02:38] theologian can tell you it's not known
[1:02:41] as hid from them they know nothing about
[1:02:43] so the schools when you say I got a pH L
[1:02:45] LD you only met you to me now I believe
[1:02:48] it to God and do any real true believer
[1:02:50] that means you're just that much farther
[1:02:52] away just back on God is not knowing
[1:02:55] about education he's not knowing about
[1:02:56] how to explain it
[1:02:57] God is long a simplicity and a
[1:03:00] revelation of Jesus Christ in the most
[1:03:02] illiterate person they not your theology
[1:03:05] it's a revelation of Jesus Christ upon
[1:03:07] this rock I'll build my church no other
[1:03:11] rocks accepted no other things except
[1:03:13] tonight
[1:03:13] no other ramen Rock nor the Protestant
[1:03:15] Rock no other school Lord or nothing but
[1:03:18] exactly the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:03:20] to the new birth he barns there and he
[1:03:23] checks his own life in your life is gone
[1:03:25] in the life of Christ is projecting
[1:03:27] itself through you with the premises to
[1:03:29] the people that they see the very life
[1:03:31] and works and signs and wonders that he
[1:03:32] did is doing the same thing through you
[1:03:35] outside of that the rest of us not even
[1:03:37] called to it all watch God's great
[1:03:41] revelation unfolding by lack of this
[1:03:45] revelation is why we have so many
[1:03:47] different divisions among us and so much
[1:03:51] mockery so much division among this is
[1:03:54] because of people lack that revelation
[1:03:56] they like that revelation the teachers
[1:03:59] Paul after his great revelation of
[1:04:02] Christ said in first Corinthians the
[1:04:04] second chapter be sure to read that as
[1:04:06] you're writing down watch oh he said I
[1:04:09] ever come to you with wisdom look at
[1:04:11] that man who did have the wisdom look at
[1:04:13] man who had the scholarship I never come
[1:04:16] to you with them kind of a word
[1:04:17] first Corinthians the second chapter of
[1:04:20] first craisins I wish this read oh how
[1:04:22] can you stand a minute let's read this
[1:04:23] verse attune
[1:04:24] I just like to read you so you you at
[1:04:26] beacon it gets even the people on the
[1:04:28] tape to turn back to it anyhow give them
[1:04:30] a chance first Korean teens the second
[1:04:32] chapter listen this great apostle here
[1:04:35] Paul the intellectual servant of God
[1:04:37] let's look at here I Paul when I come to
[1:04:41] you came not with excellency of speech
[1:04:43] of wisdom declaring to you the testimony
[1:04:47] of God I never said I I'm dr. so-and-so
[1:04:50] well I'm determined not to know anything
[1:04:53] among you say Jesus Christ and him
[1:04:56] crucified and I was with you in weakness
[1:04:59] and in fear and in much trembling my
[1:05:02] speech and and my decision was not with
[1:05:05] enticing words of man's wisdom but in
[1:05:09] demonstration of the Spirit and power of
[1:05:12] the power there see there's the gospel
[1:05:15] jesus said go you know a little preach
[1:05:17] the gospel did say go teach he said go
[1:05:21] preach in other words demonstrate the
[1:05:24] power and these signs shall follow them
[1:05:26] just teaching doesn't do it it takes the
[1:05:29] actual spirit itself demonstrating these
[1:05:31] signs
[1:05:33] listen is that's your face you're not
[1:05:36] stand in the wisdom of men but in the
[1:05:38] power of God oh my see to change the man
[1:05:43] not in what I can explain away and say
[1:05:46] he's not the same when he is the same if
[1:05:48] I do that it shows to me it's surely a
[1:05:51] man tell me that which showed me he
[1:05:53] don't have the revelation the three full
[1:05:54] revelation of God thank al Adha be it
[1:05:58] him weakness among you that are perfect
[1:06:00] yet we're not with the wisdom of the
[1:06:03] world but all the princes of this world
[1:06:06] that come to nought but we speak the
[1:06:10] wisdom of God in mystery see the
[1:06:13] threefold mystery of God even the hidden
[1:06:16] wisdom which God ordained before the
[1:06:20] world unto our glory which none of the
[1:06:27] princes of this world knew not a priest
[1:06:30] rebar rabbis for me or anything knew
[1:06:33] anything about it for hair day
[1:06:35] they would have not crucified the Lord
[1:06:38] of glory you said you're wrong about
[1:06:39] brab eyes and preachers there who
[1:06:41] crucified Him all on and on and on we
[1:06:46] could go read it Oh save time cause he
[1:06:49] got just not getting laid yet but we
[1:06:53] just got plenty here to say if the Lord
[1:06:55] will help us now lack of this now and
[1:06:58] Paul this great intellectual man never
[1:07:01] tried to express his great theological
[1:07:03] terms upon the people he humbly accepted
[1:07:07] the word of the Lord and he lived the
[1:07:10] word sort Express - he lives soul or so
[1:07:12] godly until they see Jesus Christ he
[1:07:14] needs too much so they wanted his
[1:07:15] handkerchief they're taken laid upon the
[1:07:18] sick there's a life of Christ
[1:07:21] now watch them - although you see Elijah
[1:07:24] done that long time ago ladies stick but
[1:07:26] all as the days of Elijah now the world
[1:07:29] thought that the intellectual priests
[1:07:31] and things in churches of that day

[1:07:43] foretold things are happen exactly the
[1:07:45] way it was and they know that was God's
[1:07:46] identification of a prophet and they
