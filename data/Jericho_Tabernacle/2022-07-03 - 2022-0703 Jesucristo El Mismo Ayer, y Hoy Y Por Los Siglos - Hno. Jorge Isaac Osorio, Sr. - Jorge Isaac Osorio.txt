[Music] [Applause] may the lord jesus christ bless you this morning you may be seated just for a few minutes first i want to greet you in the name of the lord jesus christ first of all i would like to thank god that brought us here safely we come from the city of tucson we've been living there for around 16 years now idiosynos for the invitation that he extended towards us we hope you don't let them down this morning amen and as well to the local ministry and all the brothers we hope to be able to get a good time out of this morning before we open the scripture the church nearly the whole church is with us here this morning i say nearly everyone because not everyone was able to come it's a small group little well what can i say about the city of the church of tucson group there's no better group to deal with than the one that god has given us there not informa problema no one causes any issues and then the one that causes the issue gets into it and there no one wants to get into any problems with me group it's a group that loves god we're all striving as as to say that [Applause] thank you sometimes as a human being you speak or you say things that as paul says you don't understand one time i heard someone else say he was telling to the person that was at their side oh yeah the brother he lives in tucson there he's you know he's in charge there there's a little group there that isn't even growing the tremendous thing is that this person what i know has never been in tucson at least they're with us maybe in the city yes but not with us and it made me remember of those that don't love brother branham and they are always trying to say something negative about brother branagh but they don't really know anything about brother branagh they don't know where he was born who his parents were quantos how many children he had they're completely unaware they don't know anything at all and just the same way we as humans we say something about someone or a place but before we get into the word i'm just going to take a few three or five minutes in june the 1st 2006 we moved to the city of tucson uh we've been living there for and residing there for 16 years and one month now and the sister only began with one sister that's she's the guilty one of why we're there serving the lord me and my family but in that time we had the two oldest the one that song lin and the one that was playing the piano yes and that's how the church started in tucson today god he's kept us there by god's grace about three years ago [Music] god allowed us to be able to get a building through the help of my brother-in-law jose sosa [Music] and in two years the lord allowed us to pay off the building after that we got a debt but with the land that was attached to it because our project is to build a sanctuary and then the current building that we have we were trying to turn it into a dining hall uh and if we hope if the lord carries medicine and if god blesses us we hope that we can complete that task amen amen then you know that will become storage if you uh know the message that's what brother branham says he says that the churches that don't join the worldwide council of churches they'll become a storage house so we're hoping if the lord comes soon or if he terry's or may he help us now if we can all please stand it's cool i apologize is okay and we called it jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever malachi chapter 3 verse 6. it reads for i am the lord i change not therefore ye sons of jacob are not consumed now let's go to hebrews chapter 13 verse 8. my family that's in colombia they're they know that i'm here and they also send you their greetings and in the little town of trinchera there's a little mission a little church that we have there me come on i got in contact with the brother and they also send you their greetings and it reads jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever lord father we thank you this this morning we ask that you give us the calm response we know that there's a great responsibility that's ahead of us there's a people that have a desire to draw close to you and i believe the entire purpose of a minister is to raise and build up the faith of the people so we ask you lord for your help we ask that you be with us we usually in tucson we have bible studies but through fun and things that you're able to learn through the reading of the bible as you begin to learn god's nature what are the things that god likes or what are the things he doesn't like in through and he left every experience and everything that's written inside of there ah so it can be helpful because one of the things that came to mind is uh i was working the story of hannah came to mind how is it that hannah in the old testament the bible says that she was barren yes and she was married to a man i believe his name was canna she was very grieved because she was unable to have children and the scripture says that she would go to the temple and pray and it says there she poured out her heart and her spirit and there was a priest during that time his name was elij and eli saw that she was praying and he thought that she was drunk but truly what was happening is that she was grieved in her heart how many of you can remember that story bueno the story ends that god gave her a son and that the name of that son was samuel and what came to me or the reason why this came to me is that way god can answer our needs but very few times we practice the habit of coming to the altar or praying to god polo normal but there is something special about the altar ayalgo especially there's something special about coming to the house of the lord amen amen and when you apply uh the same thing that he established in the beginning that remains being the same thing that's established it's a good thing that god doesn't accept us because we're from a certain family or a certain church there's only one way and it's under repentance because if it were to be that way then he died in vain at the cross we all come under the blood amen amen the prophet says that god does not have any grandchildren amen amen it says that the judge barely be saved amen amen so you can see the thief at the cross at his last he made some mistakes in his life he had to pay the consequences or just face the consequences but then the bible also states that he was a man after god's own heart okay your how is it that a man with all those mistakes uh he was still labeled as a man after god in god's own heart you know they go [Music] the man himself recognized that he needed from god and he would always humble himself and that's what god wants for a man to recognize that god is god and that he can help us amen amen and if that god does not change i mean i understood that god made a covenant with abraham in other words god he made a commitment and god gave his word when god gives his word he can't move from that clc is that right amen amen know even though if you don't say amen that's how god is what god says there was a brother that one time he said he was going to go go with me to mexico he said yes brother i'll go with you he's thought that when he said he was going to go with me he thought there was going to be a big group that was going to join me and that's why i believe he he had the courage to go and then one day when i called him mexico and i said brother let's go to mexico and i said who's going and i said uh it's just you and me and he said and i said brother you told me back then that if i ever needed your help then you would go with me i said yeah brother i said it but i didn't swear so man he always takes back what he said and depends on the circumstances that is surrounding the person they either you know they take a step back that's the human tendency that's how everyone is and some more than others is that right but that's how we are i want to buy a car and they see the price the insurance the price of gases and you know what i don't want to buy anything we regret it amen amen the decision he made that's a definitive decision forever amen amen is telling the people of israel you know what you've misbehaved a lot you're just remember that's not my subject my subject is jesus christ the same yesterday today and but forever if you're not paying your tithing then line up with god if they asked brother branham the question hermano brananan brother branham a man that doesn't pay his ties he says well i don't really have any biblical support to say that but he says but a christian pays his tithes amen amen oh what you're doing is you're blocking or interfering with your own blessing i've found at least two things that it obligates now you pay your tithing and you often don't think no i'm just going to give my tithing now and then my offering later the bible speaks of tithing and offering coc is that right you pick your tithing and your offering israel and bless is wrong and god will bless you is that right and here the people of israel were misbehaving through god's mind he thought that he was going to wipe away the entire people of israel said one time he decided i'm going to wipe every single one of them and then there was a man that stood okay [Applause] i don't want to say this but the people of israel is the type of the church and sometimes the church doesn't behave correctly is that true we're all in different stages you know up and down some are just really bad and they're for 40 years they've been in the same condition but there's other that misbehave because they still have not understood amen he says that's why you have not been consumed just as you are i still take care of you how tremendous uh how tremendous is god but uh remember it's better that we react before it's too late amen amen and he was calling them and was saying do the right thing uh leave aside the whims and the hardness of your heart that's what god was telling the people of israel for them to line up with the word and we find that the messenger of the age he says that jehovah of the old testament is jesus christ of the new testament amen amen so we can find pablo hablando that paul is speaking to the hebrews and in that same letter he said jesus christ is the same yesterday today forever he doesn't change he still remains the same amen amen we thank god for jesus christ [Music] because he had mercy on us amen god gave me two older brothers and then a younger sister but i was what you know what they say the black sheep of the family is the good thing is that i was a black sheep i was still a sheep but there's other ones that are goats but they're white goats and gods he rescued me god he crossed my path [Music] but he also allowed me by his race to be able to know the message and we believe that this message is is the great the greatest it gives us all the information that we need the one that says something different to it paul said let him be accursed amen amen is that true you should only stick to what the message says so why i'll look for anything else coc is that true if we stay with what the message says even though it hurts sometimes and then there's uh some filth that is so sticky sometimes then the grease that's in the hands of the mechanic and god has to do something but he cleans you cozy isn't that true we don't need a another revelatory to hear brother branham is a ministry unlike any other ah and sincerely where we thank god for that but there's also people that listen to these messages and the best thing is to hear him and to stay with them it's only this message god allowed us to be in jeffersonville and there we were able to meet up with some brothers brothers that we met previously before and you know there was a time that there was a lot of people that were moving over to jeffersonville pastores i even met pastors or at least just one pastor that the reason for which she moved to jeffersonville because the word truly is in jeffersonville [Music] and today we even are able to have him in social media like on youtube so you can say that the word of god is on youtube isn't that right if you go to jeffersonville and over there you hear the message marriage and divorce and then you come to phoenix and you hear marriage and divorce it says the same thing isn't that right you don't have to go anywhere specifically okay and i i didn't give it to the brothers i don't know if they can put it up i want to read in the message god is his own interpreter i'll read paragraph 49 and what the prophet said here really caught my attention and he's speaking on the manifestation jesus christ of jesus christ in this last day and it says do you guys like this is it fine if i read it it's not only play the tape here because my motto is you know that you play the tape that you read the bible you read the message and also pay your tithing an offering isn't that right is it good or are we only sticking to playing the tapes the prophet says he says brother isaac he's terrible apprentice de los hermanos what good thing did he learn from them it's good to see you even though it's a lie you're really not happy to see that person he's not right and i say look brother i'm also pleased that you can see them that's something that i learned from the bruness isn't that right there's a people that call you here you think it's a miracle that they say there's people that told me here here in the tabernacle hermano they say brother it's a miracle that you came in and they've never gone too soon and i'm here every once in a while and it's a miracle now the miracle is when you go over there the prophet says jesus he says jesus looked at them and said this is why you speak that against the son of man it'll be forgiving you but when the holy ghost haciendo las mis mas cosas to do the same thing speak against that it will it'll never be forgiven you in this world or in the world to come he was prophesying of our day the day that we should see amen brothers for he is the same yesterday today and forever and then the prophet keeps saying remember it was jesus christ that was in moses now the question is who was the one that was in william branham jesus christ jesus christ coc is not true what he in this next paragraph it says paragraph 95 the prophet says here they say elohim he says he was elohim manifested in human flesh wearing human clothes eating humans food amen a sign that in the last days that god will appear again among his people in human flesh amen amen jesus jesus the works that i shall do you do also and as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man amen amen i don't need no interpreting necesita manifestation it needs manifestation that's what it needs amen amen do you believe that any man that wholeheartedly wants to draw close to god yes and they hear the message of the hour something strikes their heart isn't that true it's a mighty message that helps us amen amen isn't that true how many like will william branham says before i see the next one uh that god has been really good to me and it's good to be here and to join together to be able to honor the resurrection that it was the desire of the local pastor for us to be here what we did is we didn't cancel the service we just moved it to here to phoenix so now here we're holding the service and god has been giving different talents and gifts to the young people and this group of sea that god has raised in tucson in one way or another not because i wish it to be somehow the among the young people the responsibility has fallen on my children for which i'm very grateful with the lord for the children that god has given me [Music] one of those is that he understands a lot about music so what we're doing in tucson nosotros indispensable we don't plea we don't believe that a person is absolutely essential we believe that there are really important in the church but not absolutely essential the only one that's absolutely essential in the church and these young people every one of them is learning to play an instrument and as i've told them the more learning that you add you'll be greater blessings if you can't do this then you can do this and i'm very happy with the lord another thing is and luckily there's been an interest of going there to tucson and that's good fellowship it's beautiful to have fellowship uh they're well behaved and if they're not well behaved then they get into problems with me but we never just you know string them along los giamos we just we lead them i don't he says we'll never become perfect to the eyes of our neighbor he's not saying that we're never going to be perfect he says he says we'll never be perfect before the eyes of our neighbor media hope just look at job the bible says that he was righteous he was upright and perfect before the lord but it doesn't say before the eyes of men because he had some friends that were just eating him alive have you read that story no this is all you may be saying or you maybe you did this and surely enough maybe those sinners those friends were more sinner than job himself but they wanted to be judged amen amen but i thank god i'm very proud i say it wholeheartedly i know that i will be accountable for what i say on the day of judgement in the blood family i couldn't have a better family than what god has given me yes and spiritually i couldn't have a better church everyone you know they're shoulder to shoulder everyone's helping there i'm very proud of them when i mentioned the shoulder to shoulder thing i just remember brother sergio navarrete when he would say the one that wouldn't put their shoulder in is just the serpent he's the only head and then he has the body he has no shoulders so he can't he can go shoulder-to-shoulder with you amen amen [Laughter] i just want to read a paragraph and then i don't want to wear you out we'll be finishing brother branham says in paragraph 74 how many understood the elohim god the great god was manifested today the devil couldn't say well i think i believe oh it was revealed to me how did the devil come for him to believe him the first thing he said is that he couldn't deny what was written he said it is written even though it was something that was said he was coming to prove sometimes if someone comes to teach something different than what william branham at least do it like the devil show me where it's written because if it's not written i don't believe him isn't that right amen amen when you're going to leave an inheritance you have to who knows that is going to have the the cow that only has one eye to be able to speak to him through him to the people hear him the prophet says or elohim in human flesh is saying where program 64 says lot is a type of the nominal denominational church down in sodom how many here are part of the denominational church in sodom i believe that we're the bride of the lord jesus christ everyone at least do it by faith true says watch the bible said that the sins of sodom vexed his righteous soul daily says why didn't he have nerve enough to stand out against it in other words job could see what was going on now let's keep reading what the prophet says hombres is he says there's a many a good man sitting in church today looking out and seeing women with shorts on and men doing these things and their memories going playing golf on sunday and picnic parties and swimming and things instead of attending church sitting home on wednesday night watching television instead of attending church they feel like saying something about it but the board would put them out he says what's the matter then it's la again mirando and afraid to call sin sin person is to say a doctrine that's contrary to what we've already received that's what the bible says that that is someone that would be a curse and the one that knows to do right but doesn't do it is a foolish man and also foolish means the church that remains in the great tribulation they're foolish so we have to get serious here coming out coming outside and just walk seriously with god we one day took a decision to follow the word to follow the word so let's be sure what is it that we're doing amen there's a great immense heaven that's awaiting us if your neighbor doesn't want to line up with the word may we keep going forward with the words brother he says in christ is the word so what brother branham says what the bible says that's what we're following amen amen is that true let's uh bride keep going forward let's uh be encouraged let's follow the the advice that's always been given to us how can we spiritually grow let's uh if you he says read and pray every day he says read your bible and pray lord god i hope that these mispronounced words could have been helpful for someone no no no no no we have nothing else to point the people to palabras but only to your word boy at their own level [Music] the only thing that we can do is just repeat what's already been stated [Music] and possibly what we did say was something new for someone else because they never had the chance to be able to hear it we asked that let it be a help for them for them that have already heard it is maybe it's a reminder of what they had heard and read before may you help them in their faith [Music] today we come lord [Music] but pressing on to california will you help us [Music] without your help father we won't be able to make it [Music] because inside of us [Music] lies reasoning and [Music] [Music] if we can all stand for the word and do what's right [Music] that's what a church needs to continue forward [Music] and father likewise [Music] we [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we pray in the name of jesus christ amen amen [Applause] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] you oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music]
