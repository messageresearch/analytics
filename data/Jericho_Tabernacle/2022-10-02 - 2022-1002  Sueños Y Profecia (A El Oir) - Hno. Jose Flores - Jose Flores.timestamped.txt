[54:00] [Music]
[54:07] once again we'll be reading
[54:10] The Book of Joel
[54:12] 2 28.
[54:19] praise God God bless him
[54:22] I'm a bit nervous this morning
[54:26] I think it's something natural a natural
[54:29] reaction for someone to get nervous
[54:32] but we're still trying
[54:40] if you have it
[54:42] foreign
[55:00] Upon Our flesh and your sons and
[55:02] daughters shall prophesy your old men
[55:04] shall dream dreams and your young men
[55:06] shall see visions
[55:13] and also upon the servants and upon the
[55:15] handsmaids in those days will apart my
[55:18] spirit amen
[55:21] God bless you may be seated
[55:26] uh nowhere
[55:30] I won't take too long today
[55:33] I just would like to make a summary
[55:36] of
[55:38] what I spoke about two weeks ago
[55:41] and as I mentioned
[55:44] I think God is
[55:50] laid out the road for me already
[55:54] before I forget before I get ahead of
[55:57] myself
[55:58] I would like to thank my pastor
[56:01] for giving me the chance
[56:04] to be able to express something to the
[56:07] bride it ministerio and also to the
[56:10] ministry
[56:11] that are in their posts
[56:15] may God bless them right Bueno
[56:30] and I said that he speaks to him
[56:34] that's what at least what I know
[56:37] if someone knows
[56:42] one of the ways
[56:44] that I can uh one of the ways for me one
[56:49] of them is dreams
[56:51] or visions
[57:03] God has spoken to me by dreams and by
[57:06] vision
[57:08] I want to summarize
[57:14] its dreams and visions
[57:16] and as I said
[57:21] the reason why the lord gave me that
[57:23] Vision
[57:25] how many here have ever had a vision
[57:39] that Vision caused me to go to a service
[57:42] uh
[57:46] [Music]
[57:49] God works in a way that we don't
[57:51] understand according to my understanding
[57:53] because we're just human
[57:55] but with that Vision that the Lord
[57:59] and I can say that God did give it to me
[58:02] because
[58:05] is
[58:07] dead because if you're if you ever get a
[58:09] vision
[58:13] you have to examine it uh through the
[58:15] scriptures
[58:17] because even the enemy can give you a
[58:20] vision
[58:22] and you can say well God gave me a
[58:24] vision
[58:26] you got to make sure that it was God
[58:30] you have to pass it and examine it
[58:33] through the Bible
[58:34] Bueno wealthy
[58:37] um
[58:41] I'm reading the message is this a sign
[58:43] of the answer
[58:46] just pay attention to what brother
[58:49] Branham says
[58:54] he says but now let me from now on for
[58:56] the next about 15 to 20 minutes let me
[58:58] take the scriptures
[59:02] if you notice in Revelations the 10th
[59:05] chapter
[59:06] now let me say this is if the vision is
[59:12] scriptural and tons is
[59:16] it can only be interpreted by the
[59:19] scripture
[59:25] and then I want you to put this together
[59:31] I could say the same
[59:35] you can put everything in in its place
[59:39] about the vision that I have you know
[59:42] you know
[59:44] I'm not hoping for you to give me your
[59:46] seal of approval yes
[59:49] I'm hoping that the Lord gives me
[59:52] about that vision and through the
[59:54] scriptures
[59:59] and during that time when I was
[1:00:01] searching for someone the dream and the
[1:00:03] vision
[1:00:04] I wasn't able to find any answers
[1:00:08] and the brothers that were over there
[1:00:14] the reply was only the prophet can
[1:00:16] interpret it for you
[1:00:20] I'll keep reading in Pages
[1:00:25] if I believe that the interpretation
[1:00:28] didn't come immediately
[1:00:31] that was God's sovereignty
[1:00:34] foreign
[1:00:35] it was God's sovereignty foreign
[1:01:26] we're fixing to something is fixing to
[1:01:29] happen
[1:01:30] amen
[1:01:34] something is fixing to happen Hermanos
[1:01:39] is
[1:01:41] we're living in tough times the physical
[1:01:45] Cristiano very tough for the Christian
[1:01:48] s
[1:01:49] and as the days go by or get even
[1:01:52] tougher
[1:01:53] if you
[1:01:57] may the Lord speak to us now
[1:02:06] I'm going to read
[1:02:08] Lucas
[1:02:11] Luke 4 17.
[1:02:14] uh
[1:02:18] despacio I want to take it slowly
[1:02:22] because I'm very nervous
[1:02:27] it's a really big responsibility just to
[1:02:29] be behind us
[1:02:31] it's really nice just to be sitting down
[1:02:34] when you're just eating
[1:02:37] all the preachers
[1:02:39] they go fasting
[1:02:59] if you want to take it or not uh
[1:03:07] we'll be reading Luke 4 17.
[1:03:15] amen
[1:03:19] we're going to talk a little here
[1:03:24] Lucas cuatro this is
[1:03:28] we'll start with uh Luke 4 16 and then
[1:03:31] going on
[1:03:41] and he came to Nazareth where he had
[1:03:43] been brought up and as his custom was he
[1:03:46] went into the synagogue on the Sabbath
[1:03:48] day and stood up for to read
[1:03:52] speaking about the king of kings
[1:03:54] foreign
[1:04:07] and there was delivered unto him the
[1:04:09] book of the prophet Isaiah and when he
[1:04:12] had opened the book he found the place
[1:04:15] where it was written is
[1:04:25] the Corazon
[1:04:27] foreign
[1:04:35] of the Lord is upon me because he has
[1:04:37] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[1:04:40] poor he has sent me to heal the
[1:04:42] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[1:04:44] the captives and recovering of sights of
[1:04:46] the Blind and to set at Liberty them
[1:04:48] that are bruised
[1:04:58] and he closed the book and he gave it
[1:05:01] again to the minister and sat down and
[1:05:03] all the eyes of all them that were in
[1:05:05] the synagogue were fasting on him
[1:05:09] foreign
[1:05:18] fulfilled in your ears
[1:05:21] one chairman can you say Amen
[1:05:25] it's not a mini me but you're Amen in
[1:05:28] the word
[1:05:32] here it's saying it's speaking about a
[1:05:36] prophet that's in the book of Isaiah
[1:05:39] and here in the New Testament it's being
[1:05:42] fulfilled
[1:05:45] the same Arkansas
[1:05:50] I can say
[1:05:52] with all the breath in my lungs
[1:05:56] Cinco says the Malachi 456.
[1:06:00] this day is this scripture fulfilled
[1:06:03] that's why
[1:06:11] because he brought God's word
[1:06:14] to reveal the word to us
[1:06:18] because
[1:06:21] now notice
[1:06:23] so
[1:06:27] is the temple right now we're living in
[1:06:30] a Time
[1:06:31] Moody fishing that's very difficult but
[1:06:34] I don't know
[1:06:35] wherever you look to your right to your
[1:06:40] left
[1:06:41] behind or in front of you El Mundo estas
[1:06:44] the world is suffering
[1:06:48] the time is very near at hand
[1:06:54] notice
[1:07:01] the time that we're now living in
[1:07:04] is
[1:07:05] a complete Insanity it's insano it's
[1:07:09] something that is not healthy
[1:07:16] but
[1:07:18] we as Christians I asked myself
[1:07:23] what are we doing
[1:07:25] how are we with God
[1:07:28] what conditions
[1:07:37] because I believe our spirituals
[1:07:44] by reading his Bible
[1:07:48] and we're going to see
[1:07:50] what conditions and in his message
[1:07:55] there's so many messages
[1:08:04] foreign
[1:08:12] that truly this world is falling apart
[1:08:18] and many of us
[1:08:24] I don't want to get into this but we'll
[1:08:26] get into it right now may God help me
[1:08:30] and may the Lord help you as well
[1:08:37] brother Branham
[1:08:39] he brought us
[1:08:41] this message
[1:08:43] and this message is
[1:08:46] to leave
[1:08:50] of this sinful world
[1:08:55] now many of us
[1:08:57] we spend our time
[1:09:00] and a technology
[1:09:03] at least
[1:09:06] I'm very ignorant
[1:09:08] in question
[1:09:09] when it comes to technology
[1:09:12] I was asking my wife uh
[1:09:19] sometimes she has to fix things on my
[1:09:21] phone
[1:09:23] I'll go
[1:09:27] will be Cardinals because sometimes you
[1:09:29] have to locate yourself
[1:09:34] it just seems that I'm going around and
[1:09:36] around spinning
[1:09:37] yeah right foreign
[1:10:02] when the economy was on the ground was
[1:10:04] so low
[1:10:07] I was working I wasn't able to work for
[1:10:09] about two to three weeks
[1:10:12] there was a lot of people that lost
[1:10:14] their jobs
[1:10:17] and there was a service on a Sunday and
[1:10:20] I said to the Lord I said Lord
[1:10:23] you know that I don't have a job
[1:10:26] I need you to give me a job
[1:10:32] before the service began
[1:10:36] and the Lord said to me
[1:10:40] now brother I can say
[1:10:43] that the Lord said to me
[1:10:46] because God is in his word
[1:10:51] so when I finish my prayer
[1:10:56] without looking for a specific quote
[1:10:59] I just opened my Bible yes and as soon
[1:11:03] as I opened it here it said there
[1:11:06] Genesis
[1:11:09] Genesis 30 28.
[1:11:12] it just it wasn't beating around the
[1:11:14] bush
[1:11:15] there the scripture says
[1:11:19] this is appoint me thy wages and I will
[1:11:22] give it
[1:11:26] that's the god that we serve
[1:11:32] and he said appoint me thy wages
[1:11:37] and as a human many times
[1:11:41] or is it true or is it not true
[1:11:45] so pondering on that
[1:11:48] um
[1:11:51] I would repeat it so often I would say I
[1:11:54] will give it and I said Lord
[1:11:56] I asked you for a job if it's you
[1:12:00] speaking to me
[1:12:01] I'm going to see God at his word hermano
[1:12:04] and brother
[1:12:05] here in this book God is here
[1:12:09] God speaks
[1:12:13] when the service was done we went to our
[1:12:16] house
[1:12:17] I got a call Steve Sanders and brother
[1:12:21] Steve Sanders
[1:12:24] a brother that goes to a church over
[1:12:26] here in the north he said brother and he
[1:12:28] says
[1:12:31] because that's how they know me
[1:12:34] foreign
[1:13:03] God answering a prayer
[1:13:06] so if you have something
[1:13:23] amen Brothers
[1:13:28] that's why we come just know that God
[1:13:32] gives to us and you ask
[1:13:35] if it's God's will God will give it to
[1:13:38] you amen amen Brothers
[1:13:43] foreign
[1:13:45] I'm gonna read
[1:13:48] like I said I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm
[1:13:51] gonna go at a slow pace
[1:13:54] I just wanted to finish
[1:13:57] LA profesia on concerning what
[1:13:59] prophecies are is
[1:14:04] the prophecy of Joel
[1:14:09] Miracles
[1:14:13] I'm going to read in the message this
[1:14:15] day is the scripture fulfilled
[1:14:18] foreign it's just this
[1:14:21] is
[1:14:23] just to confirmment
[1:14:27] uh truly what is it that we're following
[1:14:32] I believe in the messenger Williams
[1:14:37] and I believe
[1:14:39] has gone around the world
[1:14:44] from the corners
[1:14:49] a lot of people can't even reach okay
[1:14:52] this is here
[1:15:11] that same day when the pillar of fire
[1:15:14] descended on Mount Sania
[1:15:16] testimonials
[1:15:18] your testimony as you know
[1:15:22] Moses was the man caught of God
[1:15:25] um
[1:15:27] and when God called him
[1:15:30] he had to have an experience amen
[1:15:48] speak with him
[1:15:53] and anyways everything that he said had
[1:15:55] to come to pass
[1:15:57] just as
[1:16:00] if he were to say it
[1:16:03] or else no one would believe him
[1:16:09] so therefore no man has to call and has
[1:16:12] the right to call himself that
[1:16:17] until he has spoken with God face to
[1:16:19] face
[1:16:24] there in the back side of the desert
[1:16:26] when he found God himself
[1:16:31] now all the atheists in the world could
[1:16:33] not explain
[1:16:37] cannot explain it away from him
[1:16:42] he was there he knew what happened
[1:16:53] should have that experience before they
[1:16:56] say anything about being a Christian
[1:17:00] your own experience
[1:17:05] you have an experience with God
[1:17:07] you have an experience with god
[1:17:11] um
[1:17:12] and when we come here to the fellowship
[1:17:16] that's what we should be talking about
[1:17:19] the experiences
[1:17:33] for me that's real Fellowship
[1:17:36] it's fellowshipping around
[1:17:48] others
[1:17:54] grieved and then it says
[1:18:00] I want to hear something that will
[1:18:02] benefit my life in my spiritual life
[1:18:05] not to speak about it
[1:18:07] but only God's word
[1:18:17] [Music]
[1:18:41] um
[1:19:41] are you
[1:19:49] that's different from one person to the
[1:19:51] other
[1:19:53] yo
[1:19:55] medicine I like to keep my distance
[1:19:59] because I believe in this message
[1:20:07] A co-worker of my wife
[1:20:12] she attended I don't know what church
[1:20:14] but her husband
[1:20:16] they gave him a message
[1:20:19] one of these old books
[1:20:24] and they were speaking about the message
[1:20:26] and he read it
[1:20:30] but the point is this
[1:20:49] that's where the problem is
[1:20:53] or wherever
[1:20:56] wasn't living right
[1:20:58] he was drinking
[1:21:01] and it's still others
[1:21:04] that he was a Christian
[1:21:07] it really hard
[1:21:11] it really harms the message that we
[1:21:12] believe
[1:21:14] because the example was given
[1:21:16] brother Branham
[1:21:19] to follow him
[1:21:22] that's why the Lord took care of him he
[1:21:25] was born
[1:21:28] and don't dishonor your body
[1:21:32] because it's a word for you
[1:21:36] so these things that were happening to
[1:21:38] this man
[1:21:40] my brother
[1:21:42] that's just me
[1:21:45] if he was a brother
[1:21:47] well
[1:21:49] I'll drop it
[1:21:54] he spoke to his wife
[1:21:57] and my wife spoke to her
[1:22:00] and she said
[1:22:02] get away from that yeah
[1:22:06] this man he did this this and this is
[1:22:11] and tarnishing our clean message our
[1:22:14] perfect message
[1:22:34] and let me tell you something
[1:22:37] Casa at my house
[1:22:42] at the very entrance
[1:22:45] I have the picture
[1:22:47] Emmanuel
[1:22:56] [Music]
[1:23:47] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:59] and that's why
[1:24:02] photographia Contigo he said I'm going
[1:24:05] to take a picture with you because I'm
[1:24:06] satisfied
[1:24:09] and there's the pillar
[1:24:11] the same polarifier
[1:24:13] that showed up to Paul says and to Moses
[1:24:17] and so on and so forth
[1:24:20] you can see it there
[1:24:23] Anton says
[1:24:29] so why do they take it out of the
[1:24:31] churches
[1:24:33] and their excuses it offends
[1:24:36] you're offending people then
[1:24:39] are you relying on the people or God
[1:24:44] hermano brother
[1:24:47] what can we do then
[1:24:53] you're free to think whatever you want
[1:24:55] but as for me in my house
[1:24:59] that Jesus Christ is the same yeah
[1:25:02] yesterday oh today and forever
[1:25:07] brothers and sisters
[1:25:11] so
[1:26:41] it doesn't matter
[1:26:47] can tell you you messed up here and you
[1:26:49] messed up there
[1:26:51] at least I every day
[1:26:54] every while we're always fighting him
[1:26:57] and sometimes he is right
[1:27:00] well then I say devil
[1:27:05] since he know that he himself
[1:27:08] he wants you to be miserable
[1:27:12] since he knows that he has little time
[1:27:14] left
[1:27:15] he wants to take
[1:27:18] he he knows the scriptures
[1:27:21] Genesis
[1:27:29] he knows our mistakes
[1:27:33] you can answer okay okay all right
[1:27:38] now I'm gonna say your future
[1:27:45] his future doesn't look too good embargo
[1:27:48] nevertheless our future
[1:27:54] because we're under the blood of God
[1:27:58] it doesn't make it doesn't matter
[1:28:07] that they knocked down but within him
[1:28:12] he has the spirit of a champion and he
[1:28:15] says
[1:28:19] when you fall
[1:28:39] [Applause]
[1:28:48] [Music]
[1:29:20] waiting for everyone
[1:29:29] and may he not forget you
[1:29:33] so what are we in
[1:29:36] many of us that are Christians
[1:29:39] the struggle is really heavy it's hot
[1:29:42] and heavy
[1:29:45] this world
[1:30:01] I'll bomb you
[1:30:03] pero
[1:30:04] uses but God is the creator of
[1:30:07] everything
[1:30:12] they're scared
[1:30:17] what Lord what can I do
[1:30:19] trust in the Lord
[1:30:22] It's Time to trust
[1:30:25] in the hardest times
[1:30:27] you must trust in God
[1:30:34] the Lord help me
[1:31:16] but if we look like we have a tire that
[1:31:18] is so smooth
[1:31:21] the Lord will take care of it
[1:31:23] don't tempt the Lord
[1:31:26] that's tempting the Lord
[1:31:32] without an issue
[1:31:36] we visited
[1:31:38] we did what we did and on our way back
[1:31:43] in Vallarta we were there for about four
[1:31:45] hours
[1:31:48] two to three hours before

[1:32:21] worried and I said Lord

[1:32:27] spoke the next day I turn on the car
[1:32:30] issue and I went up
[1:32:35] the car didn't want to keep going
[1:32:38] we got to come

[1:35:37] knowledge

[1:35:43] Emmanuel
[1:36:19] just like Peter
[1:36:22] when Peter was in the water
[1:36:27] he wanted to walk and he did walk and
[1:36:32] then suddenly he said like the Americans

[1:36:37] it I'm walking
[1:36:40] I can't believe it I'm walking
[1:36:46] and what does it says

[1:45:16] that's why I say
[1:45:20] we can't live this way anymore
[1:45:27] there has to be an Awakening
[1:45:31] an Awakening that we must uh
[1:45:35] We've for many years have lost
[1:45:40] I've been nearly 30 40 years in this

[1:46:57] Jesus Christ in the Old Testament
[1:46:59] show me one of the Apostles
[1:47:06] but I can say
[1:47:08] there's the furnaces from Genesis to
[1:47:11] revelation
[1:47:13] it's all in there
[1:47:15] if God used Moses
[1:47:19] god uses Prophet
[1:47:21] if God will use the spirit of Elijah
[1:47:25] five times
[1:47:28] or four times and then the fifth one is
[1:47:32] yeah just be patient Hermano
[1:47:48] my time has gone by
[1:47:52] oh
[1:47:54] little Hermano
[1:47:57] police well we must pray one for each
[1:48:00] other

[1:48:08] your brother and your sister your name
[1:48:10] or your brother your sister
[1:48:12] and if you have love for them
[1:48:16] don't have love for him or her then ask
[1:48:19] yourself is
[1:48:20] God's love is
[1:48:23] you must ask yourself
[1:48:27] if God's love is
[1:48:32] if you have certain feelings against so
[1:48:35] and so
[1:48:36] then ask yourself is
[1:48:40] the Lord enthroned in your heart
[1:48:46] I'll close with this
[1:48:54] once again I'm
[1:48:56] in debt
[1:48:59] but it's
[1:49:01] that I just wanted to point
[1:49:04] how is it that God can speak to a man
[1:49:06] he's showing his Visions by his word
[1:49:11] and what's the other one
[1:49:13] summarizing
[1:49:27] todos suenos every dream no Sunday dios
[1:49:30] are not from God
[1:49:32] you have to go through the scriptures to
[1:49:34] see it
[1:49:36] all the Visions are not from God
[1:49:40] seven years old you know that
[1:49:42] is
[1:49:46] to see if it's from God or from the
[1:49:49] enemies
[1:49:51] then throw it away
[1:49:57] and if the musicians can come

[1:50:05] you live in here
[1:50:07] God bless you this morning
[1:50:13] so we're now good
[1:50:16] um
[1:50:20] I was thinking
[1:50:26] what I said last time
[1:50:28] if they can play something soft
[1:50:34] of us being on the am wave
[1:50:43] this is if you're on the a.m
[1:50:46] on that channel on that line
[1:50:51] so Antojitos those are little cravings
[1:50:58] if you're on that channel
[1:51:01] beneficial it doesn't benefit you
[1:51:03] in your spiritual life
[1:51:07] it doesn't benefit you in anything but
[1:51:10] if you is
[1:51:16] on another channel
[1:51:19] that one will benefit you
[1:51:22] it's a mature Faith that's having faith
[1:51:27] foreign
[1:51:49] because if you're weak
[1:52:11] if you can bow your heads
[1:52:13] [Music]
[1:52:16] I'll just ask
[1:52:20] if there's anyone
[1:52:22] that has the need
[1:52:26] says be spiritual one same for me that
[1:52:30] or be a sickness
[1:52:31] [Music]
[1:52:34] for God there's nothing impossible
[1:52:40] he has the answer for you at this time
[1:52:47] just raise your hand
[1:52:52] and if there's also someone else
[1:52:56] that wants to receive the Lord Jesus
[1:52:59] Christ as their only
[1:53:02] Salvador savior raise your hand
[1:53:07] and I'll make this prayer of faith
[1:53:11] and if there's someone that wants to
[1:53:13] come up
[1:53:15] and that isn't embarrassing to come up
[1:53:32] let us pray
