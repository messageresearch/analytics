in your handsome in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen it's like we're standing I like to read two scriptures first one is found in Revelations the first chapter in verse 5. [Music] the Bible says and from Jesus Christ was faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins and his own blood is made us Kings and Priests unto the gods and his father to him be the glory and Dominion forever and ever amen I like to also read Matthew 12. starting with the first verse foreign [Music] at the time Jesus went out on the Sabbath day through the corn and the disciples were hungered and began to pluck the ears of the Corn and to eat but when the first you saw it they said unto him behold the disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the Sabbath day is read what David did when he was hungered and they that were with him foreign which was not lawful for him to eat you know for them which were with him but only for the priests is or have you not read in the law how that on the Sabbath days the priest and the temple profane the Sabbath and and are blameless but I say unto you that in this place for one is greater than the temple is but if you had not but if you had known what this minute I will have mercy and not sacrifice you will not have condemned the guilty the Guiltless for the son of man is the Lord even of the Sabbath day [Music] please the bless the reading of his word you may take your seats [Music] that is the Kings and Priests and we now we know what the Bible is divided into main or principle points what is Law and what the other one is Grace now we're Kings and Priests spiritually speaking the priests were separated from the Kings if you started the genealogy uh you saw that the priest came from the tribe of levias and the Kings or these men that were Governors came from the tribe of judahismo and Jesus Christ himself is king of kings and he is high priest entrances so then under the law is those two offices were separated the priest had their job and the Kings also had their job they could not mix but with Grace those two are united and we're going to enter that in a few moments now we know that the Bible says that the law was a Shadows of good things that were to come one of those things of the priesthood and royalty foreign foreign always told us that David always typed Christ because Christ is King and he's priest so when Jesus was I was walking to this field he was the anti-type of what David did in time David as a king and to the temple and ate the bread Jesus Christ now Jesus is our King who governs us but he also gives us bread to feed us foreign who was 16 years old and made him King in the room of his father amaziah now we have a king here in the tribe of Judah this is on the 16th verse and it says but when he was strong his heart was lifted up for up to his Destruction for he transgressed against the Lord his God and went into the Temple of the Lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense wanted to do the work of a priest but the result of what he did was the opposite of what happened to David on the 26th verse 17. and azeriah the priests winning after him and with him four score Priests of the Lord that were Valiant men foreign to burn incense unto the Lord but to the priests the sons of Aaron porqueas that are consecrated to burn incense go out of the sanctuary for thou has trespassed neither shall it be for thine honor from The Lord of God foreign incense and while he was Wrath with the priests the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests of the house of the Lord from beside the answers of altar the chief priests and all the priests looked upon him and behold he was leprous in his forehead and they trust in him out from the fence yea himself hasted also to go out because the Lord had submitted him so this king is taking a job that did not pertain to him because the Kings and Priests were separated I can't find where brother Branham says but he does say that David was a type of Christ that's why David being a king is something illegally or that was did not pertain to him but regardless nothing happened to him because David was a type of Christ is Christ is the king of kings and he is the high priest and it wasn't just only David it was David and the men that were with him that's Jesus Christ that is and high priests and you are a king and a high priest just like David had men that follow him we are following the Lord Jesus Christ and we are the body foreign even to pick up the bread so that day of Sabbath is very important in the law if it was something that was broken the penalty was very strong and exodus on verse 8 this is remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy says six days shout out labor and do all thy Work is but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God and thou shall not do any work thy son or thy daughter thy man servant nor thy maidservant nor thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy Gates for the six days the Lord made Heaven and Earth a sea and all that is in that in the amazing rest of the seventh day were for the Lord bless the Sabbath day and hallowed it so these priests we're breaking the Sabbath day and nothing would happen to them because the priest they came from a very special tribe of the tribe of Levi there's a reverence that we must keep here in the sanctuary no one should move so much or cause a lot of noise we know that our dear brethren the deacons they move from place to place they speak amongst themselves and no one tells them anything because that is their duty to do that is there are they're without faults they're commissioned to carry that works but have any of us who are sitting here begin to move and speak to each other they're going to call our attention same thing with these priests you can't break the Sabbath day but these priests because these men were commissioned to do so that's why they were out there they were not guilty David and not just him but the men that were with him and nothing happened because David was a type of Christ o now Christ is now he is our Sabbath day which is Saturday is I started thinking should we not work on Saturdays and write today this morning I was reading on the Sabbath day they asked a question to brother Branham if there's a scripture that authorizes us to keep the Sunday like the Jews keep the Sabbath there is no such thing there's no such scripture in the Bible for the New Testament Grace for us to keep the Sabbath or the Sunday but the reason why we keep Sunday is a memorial of the Resurrection foreign there and had these seven golden candlesticks and there was an altar of incense now the king of Zaya tomorrow now he took the work of the incense and David took the job of the bread both men blasphemit de Cristo but David was the type of Christ Leviticus the 24th chapter on verse 5. here we speak about this bread this is and thou shall take fine fine flower and make 12 cakes thereof two cents deals shall be one cake says and thou shalt set them in two rows six on a row upon the pure table before the Lord is pure frankincense upon each role that it may be on the bread or for a memorial even as even an offering made by fire unto the Lord every Sabbath he shall set in order before the Lord continually being taken from the children of Israel by an Everlasting Covenant is Sons and they shall eat in a holy place for his most holy unto him for of the offerings of the Lord made by fire by Perpetual statute something I want you to see only in the tribe of Levi were able or allowed to eat those breads and every Sabbath day though those bread were being changed if you remember this is something very important and First Chronicles 9 32 de los Hijos Hermanos and the other Brethren are the sons of the coatites now these are descendants of the tribe of Levi it is to prepare it every Sabbath every Sabbath the showbread was being changed Samuel now let us read for Samuel on the 21st chapter is now this is a story of David when he goes to the temple this is amalek the priests and amalek was afraid at the meeting of David and said unto him why are thou alone and no man with thee is the priest the king had commanded me a business and has said unto me let no man know anything of the business where about I Cindy and what I have commanded thee and I've appointed my servants to church in such a place now therefore what is under thy hand give me five loaves of bread in my hands and the priest answer David and said there is no common bread under my hand but there is a hollow bread if the young men have kept themselves at least from women of a truth woman have been kept from us about three these three days since I came out and the vessels of the young men are holy and the bread is in a manner of common yea though I were Sanctified this day in the vessel is so the priest gave him hollow bread for there was no bread there but the shoe bread that was taken from before the Lord to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away all right something very important all these things that we're reading about we're gonna we're gonna read them and explain why they're so important but David came in a very specific name he didn't come on a Monday on a Tuesday or Wednesday he got there on a Saturday there where the bread was being exchanged that's something that's very key there where the bread was being exchanged there were the food was being exchanged now we're speaking about the bread is how is he going to give us his body to eat he said well now we know we believe Moses Moses is our Prophet We Believe Moses and our fathers was fed in the wilderness for 40 years he said I know that he said I know that but every one of them is dead he said but I am the bread of life foreign what happened in the natural in the Old Testaments it was a type that was going to happen in the spiritual in the New Testament so in the natural in the old testamentes only the priests were allowed to eat in undergrace there has to be bread where only the Believers have to eat in Israeli like Israel nutrition before paragraph 14 this is how the war in the Tabernacles how the Brazen altar the lever proposition the showbread everything pointed to Christ and in him we are completing Jesus Christ now what does the bread representation Hebrews chapter 7 part 2. paragraph 344. This is but the Perfection has come to the place that the middle person now there happens to be a Jew here or somebody that understands the old testamento to prove it let me show you I haven't got the Old Testament with me this is the New Testament but in the offering of the show bread that was laying on the kosher plate in the Jewish sacrifice at the cleansing of the Tabernacles ask any Jew on those three pieces of bread partido the middle the middle piece was broken that was Christ the middle the middle piece was broken cries in the between so that there had to be a breaking in algun aparte somewhere for Redemption yes and that piece was considered Redemption on the kosher bread and here he is and tonight when we take communion we break the kosher bread porque es el cuerpo de Cristo for it's the body of Christ and he was broken at Calvary to be a Pro Vision for our sin foreign that we feed off the Bible says we're the dead body or the dead carcass is there were the Eagles will be gathered I'm going to read another quote and then God's only provided place of worship and the mule offering that was given to Christ is and the meal offering must be grounded with a certain verb foreign [Music] but the Jews can't explain it yet why they do it and all these other things typed him now then him now we now we see now all denominations and Creeds left behind us for he is the pure unchangeable word of God which is the unleavened bread Saint John one that's right he is the unleavened bread so when you add this or that is it is 11 added to that what's already been originally given to you Jesus and the body of Jesus it was the original bread that was given out to Calvary there's several types of bread there's the showbread now when when Manna came down says and put it there in a basket and to put in the Holy place that's something very important I tres partes now there are three parts of the Tabernacle now the outer courts the holy place and the holies of holies now there's also three types of light and the outer courts one has the light of the natural sun and the light of the natural light of the stars and now in the Holy place there were seven golden candlesticks which he says that represent the seven Church ages and the Seven Messengers Glory was there it says so there's bread yeah I lose there's light and Tres difference and three different parts and there's light and the holy and the holy place that everyone can eat only worked or was good for that day they could not eat it the next day because now it already had worms Los panes the breads there are the holy place it was only good for one Sabbath to the next Sabbath and they could not eat it no longer but the manna that was there in the holies of holies it never rotten now Jesus says there in John chapter 6 verse 47 he said unto you he that believeth on me have everlasting life I am that bread of life your fathers that eat man in the wilderness and are dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man eat may eat thereof and not die I am the living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world so there's bread we got to know what kind of bread you're eating a denominational bread those who have worms or are you there found in the Holy place are you a True Believer you're eating the bread of your messenger depending on the bread of what you're eating is six bread in this row it says and six going this way and six is a man's number Dia de Lombre man's Genesis Man was created in Genesis 1 26 on the sixth day is but seven is God's number seventh day God rested aura through this foreign the fourth The Mystery of the New Testament Church as one body composed both Jews and Gentiles in that table where the where the breads were at is there with the seven golden candlesticks they represent the seven Church ages and the light was lighter The Messengers light and and a new light that was coming in the body of the lord it's six and six Jews and Gentiles through the church ages but there's also in the Holy place the bread of the Holy place just like the food was being changed from Paul trirenius from the the last Church age onto this church there was a new bread there's new Believers that were coming in together with a new light decent efficient stresses in Ephesians 3 6 against Pablo here's Paul that is speaking it says that the Gentiles should be fellow Heirs of the same body participates Jesus and partakers of his promise in the Christ by the gospel so the bread represents representative Believers spiritual and represent the spiritual food okay that the Believers we're eating for their appointed time First Corinthians 10 17 he says for we being many are one bread cuerpo for us being many are on one body participants for we're all partakers of that one bread this bread was for the priests for the Believers and every certain time the bread was being exchanged there was a lapse of time for Ephesus and there's also a bread here for the church age of laurasia foreign it's the message continually being taken from the children of Israel by an Everlasting Covenant so when David got to the temple right to the temple he arrived on the day when they were exchanging the old bread for the new bread it was there he captured a day of transition spiritual where the spiritual food is being exchanged the bread the bread represents the body so there was a new part of the body that was entering in this in this momentum it was in that moment when David arrived we already read what David asked for the bread I'm going to continue reading what happened afterwards first Samuel 21 8 this is not here under thine hand Spirit of Sword for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me because the king's business required haste where we're speaking about priests and Kings a day was a type of Christ we're talking about the bread that corresponds to the priest but in verse 9. and the priest said the soul Lord of Goliath the Philistines behold it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the airport security if that would take it take it for there is no other save that here and David said there is none like that give it to me and the seventh Sabbath is the seventh Church years Church ages now actually from the 50 days will be exactly seven sabbaths is seventh Sabbath represented the seven Church ages to be called in the time of the Pentecostal Feast of Pentecost foreign the video that David arrived in el dia on the day where the bread was being exchanged now he didn't only just receive his food but he received a sword in his hand for the second time that he used it beforehand when he killed Goliath and he killed Goliath Samuel 17. verse 48. now here's David confronting Goliath and it came to pass when the Philistines arose and came and Drew night to me David that David hastened and ran toward the Army to meet the Philistines and David put his hand on his bag and took hands of stone and slang it and smoked the Philistine on his forehead that the stone sunk on his forehead and he fell upon his face to the Earth so David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with the stone and Samantha Philistine would and slew him but there was no sword in the hand of David so David killed him with the stone he did not use a sword therefore David ran and stood upon the Philistine and took his sword and Drew it out the sheath thereof and slew him and cut his head off there with and when the Philistines saw the champion was dead they fled David primero David was the first but in verse 52 11 and the men of Israel and Judah Rose grittarius the Philistines until coming to the valley yes and they wounded off the Philistines fell down by the way of sharing is and the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines and they spoil their tents so David was the first important so that's very important so it's not just David it's David and his men not just David in the temple there was David also and the men that were with him Not only was it Jesus but as Jesus and his disciples that is only the physical body of Jesus Christ but also the mystical body of Jesus Christ but to put the example and you have to follow that example but the first one was David and he killed him with the stone and he took his sword that before they were scared that it was possible to kill those giants that's the Holy Spirit the sword of God that he first used with Jesus Christ and in our age he used in this age he used it with brother Branham because not only kills those men he also attacks you he attacks me so God uses someone as an example someone small like David like Jesus like brother Branham like an example it is possible to kill the giant God doesn't see the height God sees your heart God gives you the faith he gives you those five Stones it's fair that is Faith Gracia and Grace and when David returned back to it was very important God used someone as an example so the devil was only attack only that example he attacks and he also attacks me we already had an example in our age doesn't matter who you are God can use you all right now the beautiful thing is concerning that story of David and Goliath preparation in the message preparation paragraph 84. notice how brother Branham is typing it no and here when he went up there just dancing in the spirit as hard as he could Why by faith he saw the victory amen he saw the victory he took his little old sling in there on one of these Stones he gave a dance and here he comes coming around I can see Goliath saying what was it he had five stones English is something colettres it's five because in English it's five letters the word faith and Cinco de dos five fingers wrapped is the string around j-e-s-u-s here he comes oh brother look out you got to fall and when he's Let it Loose and the Holy Ghost got a hold of that little Old Stone and picked up a speed about a thousand miles per second between the face and he fell forward hallelujah oh my God Jim Crow like a little Jim Crow dance up there jumped on them pulled out a sword chopped his head off like that say how do you like that boy reach down and got him by the hair of his head says come on boys let's preach Divine Healing foreign Oregon or when the Divine healing powers prove that night or Yonder at Portland Oregon is ran to the platform and got through that demon right on the ground Tommy Osborne Tommy Osborne Oral Roberts Oral Roberts Jaggers Jaggers Los Dimas the rest of them took turns we cut them that was plump to the walls Victoria we've got the victory hallelujah hallelujah God prepared him a man to take care of it wasn't just only brother Branham he had healing campaigns with Tommy Osborne it was also Tommy Osborne or Robert Roberts Jaggers Jaggers [Applause] you got to overcome and he's going to attack me we already have an example doesn't matter who you are um a young boy from Kentucky that nobody would pay attention to him and God use them as an example that it is possible a court trial s remember God only works through man is you could have had the gospel preach to the stars or through the trees but he chose man is that's what he's ever done is revealing his secrets and his foreign and they're the holy spirit said because you have challenged the word of God tonight you'll fall over my feet and remember at first it was that challenged the people it's not that first we're going to go and challenge him because we want peace want to be left alone he's the one who wants the trouble God helps us now you can imagine a man in that kind of Rage a man weighing about 128 pounds Pizzeria he's like a mountain standing before you what he thought he said I'll show you whose feet I'll fall over and he jerked back to his big fist joining gun momentum memory I never moved just stood there yeah and he walked up to me and draw back like this to hit me draw back like this to hit me and I heard myself nothing that I said at all said Satan come out of the man no louder than that and when he drew back his face his hands went up and his eyes pushed the way out and went around and around his tongue went out and slobbers fell from his mouth he turned around and around and around and fell down and pinned my feet to the floor we could see now who's David the Branham the maniac David two occasions he used the sword of Goliath element two occasions use a sword in his ministry and the healing campaign the word of God is a two-edged sword that reveals the secrets are the intent of the heart the first sword it was revealing it was the discernment but also in 1963 The Sword in his hands he said this is the third pool there's two stores yes he says Redemption is in two portions or two parts two swords and here's the key when David went to the temple foreign and they said that and it was in that age when a new portion of the body a new bread was entering in what portion of the body the cloud que Vino that came it was in the transition of the spiritual food when the sword enters in the hand of the prophet of God it requires sevens and seven times seven is 49. in the 50th is the transition from the 49th year to the 50th was what David is when he received the sword in his hands right before Del jubileo before the Jubilee is when the sword appears in that transition in El Cambio and that exchange like Joshua they're going to enter the promised land and before they would take a complete position saying foreign there's a new that's coming in foreign Rey is the king 's and Priests you are Kings and Priests the sword that brother Brandon received he'd used it first but you have to come to a maturity with the word or the sword comes in your hand but when you use the word we use the sword it's going to come out of your mouth the important thing is it comes in the junction that's when the short appears if you can please stand and the message what is the extraction on the mountain he The Voice came back and said not a king sword but the king sword the word of the lord it's only the third pool is the Vindication of your ministry the message why Christ speak this is praying it is God give me the courage to take the sword of the word that he put in my hand about 33 years ago and holding a March 4th to the third pool there's two swords those spots there's two occasions where David used a swords two swords in the ministry of brothers and both occasions there were men with David foreign that message is our Mana is also our sword help us Lord help each one foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music]
