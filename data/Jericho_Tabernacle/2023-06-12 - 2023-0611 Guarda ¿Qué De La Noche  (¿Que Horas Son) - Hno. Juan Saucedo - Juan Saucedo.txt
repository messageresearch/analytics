and grateful for the good thing that you do towards with everyone and [Music] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated Brothers I want to say that I'm very happy this morning because I know a mighty God I know that a God that throughout 46 years I've seen him how he works I've seen how he's taken us forward he's taking care of us along the way the other day just this week Flagstaff I was drawing driving towards Flagstaff on the I-17 65 miles per hour that's the the advice that our pastor has given us and it's with me every time I get into my work truck I remember it if we are speeding problems we can get into trouble with the authorities but if we drive at the speed limit then we're fine if we drive three four miles below the speed limit then it's even better for us but here I was going at 60 files with the heavy load and then all of a sudden uh one of my back tires you can tell I was really scared it doesn't matter that I've been driving for 40 years but you can just imagine that the how scared I was and the people that were behind me as well only Gods watches over us I just pulled over and I said Lord this could have been worse I could have easily gone off the road but undoubtedly you're very good to us and your grace is still with us that's why I love my church and appreciate him he's my everything I live for him I give him the honor and the glory because throughout my entire life ever since I yielded and surrendered myself I've seen his hand how he's taking care of me he's protected me one time I was shot with the gun I could hear how the the bullets were just passing by but they didn't hit me they knocked me off the motorcycle that I was on but I I got up I picked it up and I started it and I left that's the mission field sometimes things happen on the mission field so that we can give him the honor and the glory for it every time I see something that I shouldn't you can see it because you're driving the people out in the streets you can imagine that at four in the morning there's women literally running on the streets doing exercise and that's fine there's nothing wrong with working out but at four in the morning with special clothing to be able to run what they call special apparel La Cruz but that's when I can see the cross that I have with me so glory to God's name because we know who is the one that is watching over us blessed be the name of the Lord if you can please stand with me we'll be reading a scripture [Music] we'll be reading in Isaiah but do you know chapter 21 verse 11. foreign it's not easy you can see the church today is a full house it's not an easy job for my brother whenever we want to criticize him just uh imagine you're in his shoes for one week just look at this it's a big responsibility and our prayers are for you may God help us all this morning amen amen [Music] we're going to start reading how many founded perdon whenever you come up here it's no longer you um [Music] a guarda que de la noche it says the burden of Duma he calleth to me out of Sayer Watchman water the night Watchmen what of the night now let's go to the new testamentos let's go to the Book of Romans chapter 13. we're going to read verse 11. verse 11. Romano Romans 13. we're going to start with verse 11. we're going to speak we're going to speak about the day and the night my brother Emmanuel did an excellent job on Friday okay for those that weren't able to be here Friday I recommend that you go watch it it was recorded I I listen to him then I go to where I have to go and then I always put time aside to hear it again it was a tremendous message that we were spoken to on Friday it says Romans 13 11. yes foreign and that knowing the time that is now is high time to wake out of sleep for now is our Salvation nearer than what we believed Hermanos amen Brothers [Music] the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of lightestamente is let us walk honestly as in the day not in writing and drunkenness not in chambering and wantonness not in strife and envying La carne which it says in verse 14 but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof is you may be seated Brothers may God bless us this morning preached on Friday it is he said your faith it activates something your faith activates God's power so this morning I'm praying and beseeching that the faith that he's pouring over us can activate then something in US it can activate our faith Lord to his name when faith is activated whatever you ask for is then received When Faith is activated whatever you ask for is but Faith must be activated you have to pray and ask for it you must have that Faith many times we ask ourselves how can we have the brothers to have that faith we can't do nothing of ourselves [Music] but he can do it because he's the faith Giver so and James says if anyone does not have it or if anyone's lacking Faith ask him of it demand it from him pray it to him and he will give it to you when that faith is inactivated when you hear the word of God which was what the brother preached to us when God's word is and the word is falling on fertile grounds it's falling on the ears that are yielded to cause glory to his name then that will activate a faith that's inside us that will make us believe glory to his name now look at Barbie when he was sitting by the wayside and when he heard a tremendous uh uproar a lot of people and he asked what's going on when they told him what was going on who was going through there yes he would recall the stories that his mother would tell him he would tell us she would tell them about Jericho she told how Joshua overcame Jericho even though Jericho at the time was surrounded by big Wars she would tell him sores when he was little and there he was sitting down at the city of Jericho he was blind but when he heard a person that cannot see Stone they have a cane Daniel and they have a white part under it there's a there's very um several ways to distinguish a person that cannot see and we all know this he had a mantle over him Cornell with him that indicated that he was a person that was blind but when his face was inactivated when they told him and answered have faith the Master's College when he finally heard he rises from where he's at he takes off that mantle and he throws it to the ground he leaves that he deserves it he abandons it he knew that he was going to get what he was asking for oh he would no longer lead that mantle anymore because his side would be restored and we all know that that's exactly what happened his sight was restored glory to his name that blind man that brother Brandon went to pray for him and he would always saying we're always saying would always say the Lord healed me and when uh that he was at the barbershop he testified to the barber yeah I can imagine what his Barber was thinking but he just kept saying it and saying it because there was something in him that was activated he had believed glory to his name yes our children don't see us when we cry but we do cry we ask God we pray to God and when we come to church we have that petition inside us we say Lord my daughter Lord my son then that faith will be activated so praise God there will be an encounter a mighty thing will Unite with another Mighty thing so I'm preaching with the trumpet this morning brother when a man fully 100 surrenders to God 100 to God yes he's a Mighty Man the Mighty Man he needed more sunlight he needed more lights come on so then he cried out he cried out and said Son stand still and it will come to pass the scientists I'm just amazed scientists [Music] they say if he would have stopped the sun there would have been such a catastrophe that we could all still remember this morning I don't care what they say the Bible says that Joshua stopped the Sun and he stopped it there's no devils in this earth that will make me disbelieve it I believe with Allah that's exactly what happened just as I believe if you surrender to God and you just call the word you speak the word you brother and sister you speak the words the Lord will grant you what you're asking foreign I believe glory to his name if she would have asked for money then money would have appeared but just look what she asked foreign what time are we living in Saturday reading messages reading scriptures after scriptures I find that brother Branham says we're in the last days he says we're living in the last days [Music] I hope we all know that we're living in the last days women are acting like men and the first thing that I see on the news is that tremendous basketball player that's a woman and we all know the story there's many women that want to be men and there's many men that want to be women [Music] the brother spoke on Friday about the white dog and the black dog now what is it that feeds the black dog the things that are in the world the things that are in the world the Bible says don't love the world verse John 3 16. don't love the world you know the things of the world if anyone loves the world then you eat it then it's for you don't say uh whatever brother Juanito speaks oh don't don't nudge your neighbor say oh that's what that's what brother Juanito is saying this morning I'm speaking to everyone we're sounding the Jubilee trumpet every Minister that stands here when he starts to preach he's sounding the Jubilee trumpet which can make you free it can make you free what is it that you need what is the Deliverance that you need in your life maybe it's cars that are still overtaking your life maybe you're feeding the black dog too much it's gotten big and huge it easily beats the white dog because it's feeding itself but if we begin to wake up from our Slumbers know what time we're living in glory to his name you realize the hour that we're living in then you're going to want to surrender to God with all your hearts you won't care about anything else nada nothing the only thing that you care for is to do God's Will and for that we need him to help us everyone knows everybody knows this morning he wants to help out if we can just acknowledge if we struggle with something if we're feeding the black dogs then the black dog will make us lose the rewards it will make us lose eternal life that's what he wants to do with some of you this morning he wants to restore your joy of Salvation who can it be this morning blessed be the name of the Lord his word is good as Mercy endures forever he can do it this morning but we have to acknowledge what is exactly what we're struggling with and don't don't be afraid run here come up here when I was younger I ran I hardly let the preacher finishes as soon as he was done I ran I had a smoking habit I had a mouse my grandmother would put soap in my mouth all right just a little he would put a she would put a little bit it was my grandmother not my mother my mother died when I was nine and my grandmother raised me so every once in a while she would open my mouth she would say open your mouth [Music] fishing in the world with our diapers we're having a good time a little boy just growing up but when my mom would say Juanito para come over here and I was I would see that she was looking for a stone you know you think I wanted to go over there no I didn't I knew what was going to happen she was looking for a little Stone to rub me with it and that really hurts brother those numbers [Music] but I had to do it but thanks to my mother glory to his name is my face and hands were Dusty she knew how to do it she knew how to do it and you think God doesn't know how to do with us he knows how to do it that's why when you see a man when he's preaching he's sounding the Jubilee trumpet he's saying you can go free I don't know but you do know [Music] there I found someone that I didn't know before there I found something that I truly needed and when he came Brothers when the preacher came and prayed for me I could feel God's presence in my life maybe for the first time just being a young man back then and I yielded and surrendered my life to God may God help and bless us all this morning the Night Comes there's a Watchman in the in the highest point just like God has a Watchman here watching over everyone that is here blessed be the name of the Lord when we're we're slumbering we're sleeping The Watchman that God has placed here maybe he can't sleep maybe he has his Bible maybe maybe because just look look how many we have here as a city we are they uses that they chose a man that could distinguish between the enemies and who the person that was not an enemy here they would pick him no one can jump higher than the pasture did he say it or not yesterday reading several messages and then in Matthew 24. I find that Jesus says will be wars and rumors of wars Russia is in war with Ukraine and we know that already they're soldiers from both sides that are dying there's a war going on right now over there there's rumors of wars we just heard either yesterday or the the day before yesterday that China put uh its headquarters in Cuba on the United States brothers and sisters what we have to do is to recognize what time is it it's 11 30. it's about to be 11 30. because I can see the clock what day of the week is it look at your calendar today is June 11th Museum my wife was telling me yesterday I went to the the cemetery to go see my son and my wife says tomorrow is the five-year anniversary of our son's death tomorrow June 11. five years ago is when one of our sons passed away his name was Miguel Jose time goes by so fast it's been five years already and I can't believe it but I have to come back to my five senses that rule over me those five senses those five senses that we make contact with each other five years ago I lost one of my children today more than ever I still want to love my Lord even more he knows what he's doing and seven he knows what he's doing may he allow us to recognize that he knows exactly what he's doing the Bible says the Lord the lord taketh away but blessed be the name of the Lord because job lost everything I was able to just escape from that to give you the news four times I just escaped to give you the note to give you the news it doesn't matter whatever he would get that those boils would keep attacking him and so finally he one day was on a heap of ashes and maybe he would throw the ashes on top of him he can no longer find the way out even his wife comes and says why don't you curse but blessed be the name of the Lord I know that in my flesh I will see God one day and he did see him because when the Lord resurrected he went for all the saints that died before him blessed be the name of the Lord and He took them all with him he took them all with him that's why the Bible says in one of the Psalms says and they answer back who is the king of glory how many know what time is it right now we're closer than when we believe First estamos we're closer than when we believed when I went to El Paso in the 80s and I saw my sister that's here Dominguez it's close to the 1983-84. because there's many brothers in here that many years ago they knew the truth so brothers and sisters don't forget that we're actually closer now listen it says and then knowing the time that now it is high time to wake out of our sleep for now is our Salvation nearer than when we believed the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light let us walk as in the day honestly not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering and wanting us not in Strife but ye on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh this flesh is [Music] whenever we fulfill the desire of what this flesh wants remember which is the one that you're feeding of the two and one of them is going to beat the other brand this uh brother random he asked his chief and he says Chief which one do you think is the one that wins [Music] he says it depends on who I feed the most that's a good answer right it depends on who I feed the most so take that with you it all depends who we're feeding the most that's the one the walls as children of the lights we're waking up now if you put your alarm at a certain time don't turn it off don't snooze it make sure and then we can be free if you lost your house in the past you could get it back then immediately if you were a slave you were working at a Ranch at the moment you would hear the Jubilee trumpets you wouldn't throw down your shovel and your hose and you would go and claim your freedom blessed be the name of the Lord and that trumpet would be sounding lasting for an entire year so blessed be the name of the Lord so we should be happy this morning that three times a week that Jubilee trumpet is sounded to us so if there's a people without an excuse we're one of those people we are without an excuse [Music] we're going to read another scripture in first Thessalonians I'm skipping over a lot of the things I'm skipping over a lot of things I wanted to say but a glory to his name because he's the one that has the controls we just surrendered to him first Thessalonians 5. if you find it say Amen I'll be in verse says but of the times and the seasons Brethren ye have no need that I write unto you it says for you know yourselves perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night glory to his name and say hey I'm coming steal for me please don't come out our car isn't there anymore when we go out yeah our truck isn't there anymore they stole it from us who stole it from us and he didn't notify us at what time he was coming at what time did he come he just came and took our truck we didn't even notice we were dreaming with the angels and the Stars hopefully with the angels the other day I had a dream that I was crashing my truck see so yes that I I dreamed that but then I woke up it was just a dream it was just a dream but it seems that it's real hasn't that happened to you it seems real just pay attention to him don't get scared just pay attention to him and keep still about a year ago don't wake up and call me immediately at 1am because then I will die for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not Escape Now record this memorize this but ye Brethren you brothers were preaching to you yes it says are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as it is because the children of lie and the children of the day we are not of the nights nor of Darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others let us watch is Glory to his name amen Brothers says therefore Brethren this is in verse therefore let us not sleep as do others well let us watch and be sober the Night Comes but when that night comes and goes then the day comes the day comes let's be Children of the day let's be Children of the day not of the night I tell my family and to many of you I give this Council if you don't work during the night because there are brothers that work during the night they're sisters that work during the night if you don't have a night shift we have no business being outside hopefully I'm speaking to people with revelation we have no business being outside because the majority there are outside and are of darkness and they love Darkness they're waiting for the night to come they're waiting for the the night time to come but we are not of the night we are the day we're part of that glow that the Lord has sent to us so glory to his name Zechariah 14 6 and we'll be closing time went by so quickly but the Lord knows everything amen Brothers may God give us the life in the house we'll pick this up on another occasion Zechariah 14. have you found it and I would appreciate if the musicians can come forward now as well there you can receive your healing many have already received it the elders have now prayed for you now my question is do you believe amen amen I believe it and to his name be the glory amen Hermanos amen Brothers because we feel embarrassed many times we don't come up because we think that somebody else will criticize us but do you know this when I ran to that place I ran up there and I didn't care that everyone else was criticizing I knew the need that I had yeah and have a good I have good news for you Leos God God gave me what I needed and those is so many times we say I don't know I would like to know but I don't know we just remain in the pews but if you stay in the Pew stay there stay there just sit there but what you have to do is open your heart to God God bless the musicians this morning the scripture says here is shall come to pass in that day say that the light shall not be clear nor dark those that know the message know what the prophet says about the scripture many people were not going to know what to do denominations or the truth there's only one truth solamente there's only one message our brothers have been saying it and preaching it there's only one Bible [Music] that's the one that I use this morning there's only one Bible and there's only one message so blessed be the name of the Lord [Music] is explaining what the Bible says to us amen amen to him or lose we've had lights at the evening time and it says in verse 6 and it shall come to pass on that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord but it shall come to pass that in the evening time it shall be light there shall be lights that's something that I believe all this uh this morning with all my heart if I ask how many believe this morning now there shall be lights many people don't know in in water I don't know that he's Mighty foreign [Applause] there was a cry that was made and brothers we woke up but I started trimming our lamps we started putting the oil is the Holy Ghost amen amen so if we have our lamb lit if we believe this message which is the truth it says by the truth and sell it that's why we're here we don't want to sell out what we have received by Grace the glory to his name how many are children of the lights now how good we are but he's the one that has made us Worthy so
