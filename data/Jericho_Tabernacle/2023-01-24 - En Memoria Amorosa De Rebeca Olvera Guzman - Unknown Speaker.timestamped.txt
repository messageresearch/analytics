[44:30] Remos
[44:33] hermana
[45:07] foreign
[45:17] first of all would like to Center
[45:19] condolences to the the Guzman family
[45:21] [Music]
[45:24] for myself my family
[45:27] and on behalf of here the members of
[45:30] here of Jericho Tabernacles
[45:34] I believe for the flesh it's a it's a
[45:37] very
[45:38] um sad and nervous time
[45:43] but I I believe for the for the believer
[45:46] it's a very joyful time
[45:51] especially for those who knew sister
[45:53] Rebecca is
[45:56] and I believe anybody knew sister
[45:59] Rebecca was her very own family
[46:04] if anybody knew her was her children
[46:09] who was her was her daughters-in-law
[46:13] their her grandchildren they were the
[46:16] ones who really knew who sister Rebecca
[46:19] Guzman was hey yes
[46:23] we were so privileged to be able to know
[46:26] her to get to meet her
[46:29] and to know how God works with anybody
[46:34] he wants to work with
[46:38] and I was looking at her had her name is
[46:44] Rebecca Olvera Guzman is
[46:48] and I like to really look at their names
[46:51] and their definitions
[46:54] and what their what what they meant his
[46:58] brother Brandon says those those names
[46:59] give a certain influence to the person
[47:01] is
[47:05] so the definition of the name Rebecca
[47:09] definition
[47:10] or the meaning
[47:12] it's to tie or to bind is
[47:17] uh the meaning Olvera
[47:21] is Olive or Olive Tree
[47:25] and the meaning of Guzman El certificate
[47:28] is a descendant of a good man is
[47:35] so sister Rebecca
[47:38] she was tied yeah foreign
[48:18] brother Branham says that is a type of
[48:20] the Holy ghosts
[48:22] you grab an olive and you just squeeze
[48:26] the ingredients out of it
[48:29] that's olive oil
[48:32] and that was Sister Rebecca Guzman yes
[48:36] she was an olive tree to her family
[48:41] she was a pillar to her family
[48:44] she was olive oil
[48:47] and she was Guzman a descendant of a
[48:51] good man
[48:54] the sentence of her a good father or a
[48:57] good grandfather this is
[49:00] but we know as we were born again
[49:04] says we have a new father
[49:08] and that is Jesus Christ
[49:11] so she is a descendant of a good man
[49:14] don't say yes
[49:16] noble man
[49:20] so you notice every name has a meaning
[49:25] significado she binded her family
[49:28] to the Olive Tree Jesus Christ
[49:32] and the descendant of a good man Jesus
[49:35] Christ
[49:37] I'd like to thank brother art for giving
[49:40] me the time to speak
[49:43] in her family so familiar in these
[49:46] difficult times
[49:47] I was talking to Brother Art I said
[49:50] Brother Art how did your mom knew the
[49:52] message
[49:57] how did she come across this beautiful
[49:59] message
[50:02] you know brother art he's a descendant
[50:05] like me from Texas
[50:09] and they were farmers who go into
[50:12] different places to pick out the farm
[50:14] the the the the fruit or the Farmland
[50:17] yeah
[50:21] in this moment in their life they were
[50:24] located in Michigan
[50:27] and sister Rebecca she was a Pentecostal
[50:32] woman
[50:33] amen now brother we know what brother
[50:35] Ram says about Pentecostals
[50:39] and she knew how to read her Bible
[50:42] every time she'll get home she'll read
[50:45] her Bible
[50:47] and then she ran into a scripture of
[50:51] Malachi 4 5.
[50:54] and she says behold I send you Elijah
[50:58] the prophet he said
[51:01] and she says there's a prophet that's
[51:03] coming
[51:05] now I want you to notice on a side note
[51:10] nobody told her of William Miriam
[51:12] Branham
[51:15] Michigan at this time
[51:18] and she's reading her Bible like a good
[51:21] Christian woman
[51:24] and she says there's a prophet that's
[51:26] coming it is
[51:28] we gotta start getting ready
[51:30] because the Prophet Elijah is coming
[51:34] and what she did
[51:36] nobody told her what she had to do
[51:40] she began to pray and she began to fast
[51:45] for weeks began to pray and begin to
[51:48] fast
[51:49] ready to receive this Prophet that was
[51:52] coming that was foretold by the
[51:54] scriptures
[51:58] and then she comes to her across the
[52:00] family
[52:02] and I believe brother
[52:04] family
[52:07] and they told her so she said to them
[52:10] we're waiting for a prophet is
[52:13] because the scripture says there's a
[52:15] prophet that's coming
[52:42] and we're waiting for him to come back
[52:48] she didn't receive it from second hand
[52:51] she didn't receive it from anybody else
[52:55] she received it straight from God
[52:58] himself
[53:06] she was tied to the word of God
[53:10] she was a tree to treat her family
[53:15] from the message
[53:18] nobody told her well if there's a
[53:20] prophet neither convince her that
[53:22] there's a prophet
[53:24] no God revealed himself to her
[53:28] and then we see the fruits of it we see
[53:32] that he she gave birth to a very good
[53:34] young man
[53:38] tremendous man
[53:40] I wish we could have ten of him hundreds
[53:42] of him
[53:44] he's everywhere
[53:55] who instructed her children in the right
[53:57] way
[53:59] taught him how to dress right
[54:02] how to shake their hand the brother's
[54:04] hands right
[54:06] the reason I say that
[54:10] I'm gonna say this
[54:13] it might sound a bit funny but I'm not
[54:15] trying to be funny
[54:18] I was uh I have this little little
[54:21] relationship a little man-to-man
[54:24] relationship with robertito uh
[54:29] and we have this thing where we just
[54:32] shake each other's hands
[54:36] and sometimes would be funny we just
[54:39] kind of shake a little hard and we we
[54:40] move our arms like this yeah this is
[54:46] I encouraged it foreign
[55:47] yeah she still came to church
[55:50] she never got a ride from no one
[55:54] right she always drove herself here
[55:58] three times when she'll be parking all
[56:00] the way in the back
[56:03] there was no room there here in the
[56:05] front yeah
[56:06] so she'll Park all the way in the back
[56:09] and our little golf cart wasn't working
[56:13] she'll walk all the way over there
[56:16] and she never complained
[56:19] she never fought for a parking spot
[56:23] she just wanted to get here to church
[56:26] her eyes were on the Lord Jesus Christ
[56:30] and we're so thankful that we got to
[56:32] know and and have amongst us a sister
[56:39] that's so tremendous
[56:42] little things like that they make they
[56:44] give us an example
[56:48] that it's not about parking spots
[56:50] it's not about dressing well
[56:54] fancy
[56:56] serving Jesus Christ
[57:00] so we thank God for her
[57:03] and for her giving through her
[57:07] tremendous children and grandchildren
[57:11] we thank the family once again
[57:15] we thank Brother Art and sister Sharon
[57:18] guzmann
[57:19] this is her daughters
[57:25] condolences
[57:27] it could be kind of hard at times like
[57:30] this is
[57:32] but as she was departing
[57:35] she didn't want to turn back
[57:38] this is what she fought foreign
[58:10] foreign
[58:17] God bless you
[58:20] um
[58:33] on wanting to say just get them down get
[58:35] them down
[58:36] otherwise he's not going to let me say
[58:38] anything

[58:42] that
[58:44] first of all before I forget is
[58:48] I want to give condolences unto the
[58:50] family
[58:53] I want to thank them for allowing me to
[58:55] share some words
[59:00] and I want to thank the brothers that
[59:02] have helped us out
[59:05] foreign
[59:11] we were called from eternity
[59:16] God didn't call us to come in any other
[59:18] age
[59:20] he called us to come in this age
[59:23] to be manifested
[59:27] and to fulfill our purpose
[59:31] after we finish our purpose
[59:34] return back home
[59:38] I know it's not easy to lose a loved one
[59:41] my father passed it wasn't easy
[59:48] there's the Assurance within me
[59:53] I don't serve a dead God I just
[59:57] I serve a living God
[1:00:00] I came from eternity

[1:00:33] what you've got to be sure
[1:00:38] that when God finds himself with you in
[1:00:41] your journey
[1:00:42] you can accept him
[1:00:45] because he died to save us to redeem us
[1:00:50] to give us eternal life
[1:00:53] and it was free it's free
[1:00:57] I didn't do anything

[1:01:10] English no Spanish
[1:01:43] the only perfect one is God yes and he's
[1:01:47] the one that lives in US
[1:02:02] and I married her
[1:02:06] and so I'm a winner
[1:02:12] but sister Rebecca did the best that she
[1:02:14] could
[1:02:16] she lived the life
[1:02:27] and it was time for her to go home
[1:02:31] that time will come unto every one of us
[1:02:35] but you've got to be sure
[1:02:37] that's why I don't cry

[1:02:44] what can you say because
[1:02:46] that my redeemer liveth
[1:02:49] and I won't go back
[1:02:53] because in my dead father's end
[1:02:56] he was the worst
[1:02:59] he drank he smoked
[1:03:02] and he was just the worst
[1:03:05] when I started to go to church
[1:03:08] he told me don't talk to me
[1:03:11] because I'm going to keep being a drunk
[1:03:18] God gave him the opportunity
[1:03:21] to serve the Lord
[1:03:24] he gave him the best he could he
[1:03:27] fulfilled with what he did and he left
[1:03:31] and I'm not sad okay
[1:03:34] because I know I'll see him again

[1:12:20] Familia
[1:12:35] [Music]
[1:12:39] Arizona when our family we left here
[1:12:42] from Arizona
[1:12:45] and we moved on to the City of Arlington
[1:12:47] Texas naturally which is in Texas
[1:12:53] she was one of those that opened her
[1:12:55] home but uh
[1:12:58] to allow us to be in her house
[1:13:04] she opened up her home to have Services
[1:13:06] there
[1:13:10] she was just an extraordinary woman
[1:13:12] brother a
[1:13:15] it was a pleasure to be able to know her
[1:13:21] when her husband
[1:13:26] we knew him as Don Benito
[1:13:30] is
[1:13:36] she called me in the evening
[1:13:39] and I went to the hospital
[1:13:45] and when she was waiting to hear about
[1:13:47] her husband
[1:13:48] when the doctor came out
[1:13:52] and he gave us the news
[1:13:58] had passed away
[1:14:03] she took maybe a minute or two
[1:14:07] without saying anything
[1:14:10] she was in silence
[1:14:14] then she stood up she said
[1:14:19] so what is it that I must do now
[1:14:24] what papers do I have to sign
[1:14:28] what's the process to continue on
[1:14:38] naturally the news impacted her
[1:14:41] but it took two dos minutos two minutes
[1:14:47] and then she reacted
[1:14:51] what do I need to do to continue forward
[1:14:56] those are things you just can't Forget
[1:14:58] Brothers
[1:15:02] I'm going to ask if you please stand for
[1:15:04] a moment
[1:15:05] and I want to read a portion of the
[1:15:08] Bible
[1:15:10] we find it in Job chapter 2
[1:15:15] Job chapter 2 verse
[1:15:18] Ecclesiastes
[1:15:20] forgive me it's Ecclesiastes chapter
[1:15:22] three we're going to read verse one and
[1:15:25] two
[1:15:27] they say s
[1:15:32] yellow
[1:15:36] to everything there is a season and
[1:15:38] every purpose under him and the time to
[1:15:41] every purpose under Heaven
[1:15:43] a time to be born a time to die
[1:15:47] a time to
[1:15:51] plantado and a time to pluck up that
[1:15:53] which is planted let us pray
[1:16:02] we thank you for the life you permitted
[1:16:04] our sister
[1:16:08] and for every person today that has
[1:16:10] shared their presence
[1:16:13] to honor this woman Lord
[1:16:16] we ask that you help us
[1:16:18] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:16:21] amen amen
[1:16:23] brothers please take your seats
[1:16:29] we know that in the Bible Brothers
[1:16:38] he went through a very difficult
[1:16:40] situation
[1:16:42] but he had two friends
[1:16:47] they came to see their friend Joe yeah
[1:16:51] and they saw that he was in a difficult
[1:16:53] situation
[1:16:54] Dos Amigos these two friends
[1:16:58] they sat next to Joe
[1:17:01] for seven days
[1:17:04] without speaking
[1:17:10] with the sole presence of these friends
[1:17:13] I hope they were telling Joe estamos
[1:17:17] Contigo we're with you
[1:17:19] this morning
[1:17:22] everyone that's present here he says
[1:17:26] we might not be able to say much
[1:17:31] but just with the presence of you being
[1:17:33] here is
[1:17:37] that we're with them amen amen
[1:17:44] the Bible speaks to us in the scripture
[1:17:46] that we just read
[1:17:48] there's the time
[1:17:50] for all things
[1:17:53] there's a time to be born
[1:17:56] she had her time
[1:17:58] October
[1:18:00] 20th Centos 1945.
[1:18:05] IE
[1:18:07] there's also a Time To Die
[1:18:12] the 9th of January of 2023.
[1:18:17] God was good with her
[1:18:22] he extended unto her all these years of
[1:18:24] life
[1:18:27] but the scripture certainly fulfills
[1:18:29] itself
[1:18:33] there's a time where we also must die
[1:18:37] in this trajectory of life is
[1:18:42] it's God's hand
[1:18:47] Works through all things Brothers
[1:18:51] God does things in silence
[1:18:55] but in that is God's hand for example
[1:18:58] for example
[1:19:02] God can bring the two of the morning
[1:19:07] that can bring much more water
[1:19:10] then those great rainfalls
[1:19:14] it is silent
[1:19:18] that's the way that God operates
[1:19:26] we want to determine our time here on
[1:19:28] Earth
[1:19:31] we find ourselves sane on occasions
[1:19:34] I want to die
[1:19:37] nonetheless
[1:19:41] God is the one that has the last word
[1:19:43] about that is
[1:19:48] God the one that determines when we're
[1:19:50] going to go
[1:19:51] for that
[1:19:56] I want to read the book of Job chapter
[1:19:59] 14.
[1:20:02] and I want to read to you the first six
[1:20:05] verses it says
[1:20:10] Corto de dias
[1:20:12] in sabores man that is born of a woman
[1:20:15] is few of days and full of trouble
[1:20:19] yes cortado
[1:20:24] he comes forth like a flower and is cut
[1:20:28] down he flareth also as a shadow and
[1:20:30] continueth not is Contigo
[1:20:37] and thus thou open Thine Eyes Upon such
[1:20:40] as one and bring us me into judgmento
[1:20:45] love you who can bring a clean thing out
[1:20:48] of an unclean not one
[1:20:52] I want to focus on number five
[1:21:06] seeing his days are determined the
[1:21:09] number of his months are with thee thou
[1:21:11] has appointed his bounds that he cannot
[1:21:13] passer
[1:21:21] turn from him that he may rest till he
[1:21:24] shall accomplish as in hiring his day
[1:21:29] it's a very tremendous scripture
[1:21:32] to the Guzman family
[1:21:37] I want to comment to you that this same
[1:21:40] scripture
[1:21:41] God gave it to me
[1:21:45] when we made the when we had the funeral
[1:21:48] for Don Benito
[1:21:50] that was her husband
[1:21:53] but the Bible speaks to us
[1:21:57] and Compares us as a flower
[1:22:00] that it comes out one day
[1:22:04] and we see the beauty of the flower is
[1:22:08] that is our youth
[1:22:17] and the youth is certainly beautiful
[1:22:22] but we don't stay young forever
[1:22:28] nor does the floor stay radiant forever
[1:22:32] it also grows old
[1:22:35] every time I look in the mirror
[1:22:38] I see myself just a little older but
[1:22:41] this is
[1:22:43] but it's like the shadow
[1:22:46] that it flees
[1:22:52] on occasions were seated they're in the
[1:22:54] shade
[1:22:57] but as the day passes
[1:23:01] that shadow starts to go away from us
[1:23:08] and there's no way that you can keep
[1:23:10] that shadow
[1:23:13] the rotation of the earth needs to pass
[1:23:21] you can't withhold the shadow in the
[1:23:24] same manner
[1:23:26] we cannot withhold life forever
[1:23:31] the shadow leaves
[1:23:35] but there is a new day brothers
[1:23:40] that the sun comes up again
[1:23:44] and the day starts over again
[1:23:49] that's the hope of all Christians
[1:23:52] The Book of Job
[1:23:56] it's one of the oldest books of the
[1:23:58] Bible
[1:24:00] but since back then a hope job
[1:24:04] he would ask himself the questions
[1:24:10] will he live again
[1:24:13] sure he will
[1:24:17] Campo it's like the flowers of the field
[1:24:20] Primavera they come out in the spring
[1:24:22] they get a little older Proxima
[1:24:25] Primavera but then next spring they come
[1:24:29] out again
[1:24:31] we just wait
[1:24:33] that next spring
[1:24:37] because we'll be young again Brethren
[1:24:40] amen amen
[1:24:49] that's how I'm going to look
[1:24:55] we see that she was a beautiful woman
[1:25:01] and that's how we will see her again
[1:25:06] because brother Brandon
[1:25:09] in his simple way of just bringing the
[1:25:12] message
[1:25:14] it tells us like the tree
[1:25:18] approxima when he knows that the winter
[1:25:21] is approaching
[1:25:23] the life of that tree okay
[1:25:26] which is that that's that's Salvia the
[1:25:29] sap
[1:25:32] it goes down onto the roots
[1:25:35] because there's a wisdom
[1:25:39] that says that the winter is drying
[1:25:42] clothes
[1:25:45] naturally it had a spring
[1:25:48] like all of us
[1:25:52] and then the summer approaches
[1:25:57] when things get a little hot pero
[1:26:01] but during that time
[1:26:04] the tree gives forth fruit
[1:26:07] is
[1:26:09] Rebecca and in the case of our sister
[1:26:10] Rebecca
[1:26:12] she also brought forth fruit
[1:26:16] then the Autumn comes
[1:26:23] when the trees let down all of their
[1:26:25] leaves
[1:26:27] when the hair starts to fall off
[1:26:31] until the winter comes
[1:26:36] and you might say well shall we cut the
[1:26:38] tree down because it's dead
[1:26:40] surely we should not
[1:26:44] it's just sleeping
[1:26:48] we just need to wait the next spring yes
[1:26:52] and that tree will be dressed once again
[1:26:56] and we'll bring forth new leaves
[1:26:59] heels in sufurmas and sigreser God in
[1:27:02] his simple way of being
[1:27:05] a resurrection he speaks to us of a
[1:27:07] death and of a resurrection
[1:27:11] because he died for us
[1:27:13] foreign
[1:28:19] usually we just ask ourselves the
[1:28:21] question
[1:28:25] what happens with us during this time
[1:28:28] period of death
[1:28:31] elements naturally the body being made
[1:28:35] of the elements of this Earth
[1:28:38] it also goes back onto the Earth
[1:28:44] that's why it says that dust shall turn
[1:28:46] back into dust
[1:28:49] our 16 elements that compose this body
[1:28:53] Etc they're calcium and sulfur and all
[1:28:55] those things
[1:28:57] all those things go back into the dust
[1:29:00] of the Earth
[1:29:07] when Jesus was about to be crucified
[1:29:11] he said father enters
[1:29:15] in thy hands I commend my spirit I place
[1:29:18] my spirit it's the spirit okay
[1:29:20] so then this Spirit that's within us
[1:29:24] it goes someplace unto God
[1:29:28] because that's what Jesus did
[1:29:32] I place my spirit in thy hands
[1:29:36] but our soul
[1:29:39] goes to a specific place
[1:29:42] a place separate from God
[1:29:46] there's no old men
[1:29:50] there's a body no somos un Espirito
[1:29:53] we're not a spirit
[1:29:56] we're not floating out in the in the
[1:29:58] clouds there's a body
[1:30:01] separate from God
[1:30:04] for if this body will be destroyed
[1:30:07] we've got another prepared from God
[1:30:10] that one is in this body
[1:30:14] that no longer has any pain
[1:30:17] how tremendous
[1:30:21] it no longer feels any shyness
[1:30:24] there's just Joy there's this joy and
[1:30:28] happiness
[1:30:31] there was someone behind this curtain a
[1:30:34] prophet
[1:30:36] that said I saw young people
[1:30:40] in the prime of their youths
[1:30:43] with all their teeth
[1:30:47] there they won't take out all of our
[1:30:49] molars
[1:30:51] getting them in there how tremendous
[1:30:54] it's a place there with God
[1:30:59] it's not our home
[1:31:02] we've got a home yes
[1:31:04] that home is here on the earth
[1:31:08] it's a place that we're waiting case
[1:31:12] Perfection that is perfection
[1:31:15] everything is
[1:31:17] it's it's happiness because
[1:31:22] that's the hope of every Christian
[1:32:20] she is in that place
[1:32:24] I can Only Imagine
[1:32:31] the encounter with all those that have
[1:32:33] already passed
[1:32:36] just think for a moments
[1:32:42] we've got loved ones on the other side
[1:32:47] she's got a son
[1:32:49] and what she's already reunited
[1:32:53] wow wow
[1:33:00] that she can hug him
[1:33:03] contemplarla it's in contemplating
[1:33:07] and to know that he's there
[1:33:10] siertamente surely
[1:33:14] Ernesto Ernesto
[1:33:17] has a question
[1:33:20] how are my brothers
[1:33:25] we want to know about our family
[1:33:29] how are my brothers and sisters
[1:33:32] how'd you leave them
[1:33:38] everyone will respond for that see
[1:33:42] but when the Resurrection comes
[1:33:46] primeros this is the first sedan es the
[1:33:51] last shall be first
[1:33:54] the god in his great wisdom
[1:33:58] the last that have gone
[1:34:02] they'll rise up first
[1:34:05] and then we'll see them
[1:34:08] and no longer have the question
[1:34:15] did they make it in the rapture
[1:34:18] is
[1:34:19] that question will be answered we'll see
[1:34:23] them
[1:34:24] we know that we'll be together
[1:34:26] God's family
[1:34:29] once again reunited
[1:34:32] to be taken up all together
[1:34:36] no longer with the questions is my
[1:34:40] mother there is
[1:34:41] my brother there yeah we'll have the
[1:34:45] answer
[1:34:56] that great Gathering that she's having
[1:35:00] partido all of our Brethren that have
[1:35:02] gone uh passed away
[1:35:05] they are there
[1:35:10] I want to read first Thessalonians
[1:35:14] verse 13 and 14. Hermanos
[1:35:18] foreign
[1:35:28] but I would not have you to be ignorant
[1:35:31] Brethren concerning them which are
[1:35:33] asleep that is sorrow not even as others
[1:35:36] which have no hope Jesus
[1:35:41] Ito
[1:35:49] for if we believe that Jesus died and
[1:35:52] rose again even so them also would sleep
[1:35:54] in Jesus will God bring with him
[1:36:10] there are people that die
[1:36:12] without Christ without any hope for we
[1:36:17] is
[1:36:19] naturally we do get sad
[1:36:23] but not as those that they don't have
[1:36:25] any hope
[1:36:26] because if we believe that Jesus Christ
[1:36:29] he died and resurrected then we also
[1:36:33] believe
[1:36:34] he'll bring with him
[1:36:36] all those that sleep is
[1:36:41] that's what we believe in our sister
[1:36:43] Rebecca one day
[1:36:46] not too far
[1:36:49] they will see her again
[1:36:52] Bueno Perla photos
[1:36:55] it'll be very wonderful to see the
[1:36:57] picture
[1:36:58] to be able to recognize her yeah
[1:37:03] she'll be young once again
[1:37:06] she is young
[1:37:10] when people say well we'll be younger
[1:37:13] will we be old
[1:37:14] no if God already made us Young when he
[1:37:19] brings us he won't bring us back elderly
[1:37:23] still bring us back young it does
[1:37:26] then let's look at her pictures when we
[1:37:29] see her
[1:37:30] we can recognize
[1:37:36] it's a pleasure again
[1:37:38] to have you in our midst
[1:37:41] and that together
[1:37:44] we'll go together in a Rapture
[1:37:47] because that's what awaits us
[1:37:55] these are just my brief words it's
[1:37:59] the time that was given unto me
[1:38:01] I believe
[1:38:04] we've got a great hope on God's behalf
[1:38:09] that all those that are dead
[1:38:12] they'll hear the voice of God
[1:38:15] and they'll rise up once again
[1:38:22] we'll let forth its leaves once again
[1:38:26] when the tree loses its leaves
[1:38:29] and it rises in the spring
[1:38:32] it's not searching for the old leaves
[1:38:36] but simply it'll give forth newly yes
[1:38:40] that's what we're waiting
[1:38:43] will be dressed newly with
[1:38:47] eternal youth
[1:39:04] and who lived in her
[1:39:07] it's yes and if that spirit is in her
[1:39:10] it'll raise her up again amen amen let
[1:39:15] us pray brother
[1:39:19] we thank you this morning
[1:39:22] for the life you gave our sister Rebecca
[1:39:26] for the fruits of her womb Lord
[1:39:31] as we take her unto her rest Lord
[1:39:35] fulfilling the word
[1:39:38] that the dust shall return unto dust
[1:39:42] but surely she's no longer there
[1:39:46] but she's got a place set apart from God
[1:39:50] where those that sleep in him are at
[1:39:53] Senora Lord
[1:39:55] give us this Revelation yes
[1:39:58] and that full Revelation that full hope
[1:40:03] that we wait upon the Lord
[1:40:05] that when you return
[1:40:13] that place will be soon
[1:40:15] may God bless you
[1:40:19] may God be with you brother
[1:40:22] bless you richly and abundantly amen
