[20:50] people even through the
[20:51] [Music]
[20:54] internet uh many times the internet is

[25:29] thank you Brothers you may be
[25:33] seated our musicians as well they may be
[25:35] seated thank you so
[25:41] much I really appreciate the brothers
[25:43] that dedicate themselves to the music
[25:50] department if I were to mention that I
[25:52] have a guitar in my
[25:57] room and for several years I've been
[25:59] trying to learn how to play
[26:02] it and even until
[26:06] now I've been I'm haven't been able to
[26:09] be able to learn
[26:11] it and with that you you can understand
[26:13] the
[26:14] [Music]
[26:15] rest and I don't want to be
[26:19] convinced that's not my
[26:22] gift that that is not my
[26:27] gift
[26:29] I can have a guitar a piano uh in the
[26:32] drums as
[26:34] well but it's not my
[26:37] gift it's really hard for
[26:44] me so the the shoe maker goes to his
[26:47] shoes everyone to it to their own
[26:54] office now if you'll excuse me if I do
[26:57] this
[27:03] just as you are seated I would like for
[27:04] you to open your
[27:09] Bibles we'll be reading in the book of
[27:12] First Corinthians chapter
[27:24] 13 and I would like this to open the
[27:27] hearts and as well to break the ice that
[27:29] sometimes
[27:34] lingers in First Corinthians 131 it
[27:48] says though I speak with the tongues of
[27:50] men and angels and have not charity I am
[27:53] become as sounding brass or a tinkling
[27:56] symbol is it
[28:13] and though I have the gift of Prophecy
[28:15] and understand all Mysteries and all
[28:17] knowledge and though I have all Faith so
[28:20] that I can remove mountains and have not
[28:22] charity I am
[28:27] nothing
[28:38] and though I bestow all my goods to feed
[28:40] the poor and though I give my body to be
[28:42] burned and have not charity it profit me
[28:48] nothing love is p charity suffereth
[28:52] long and is
[28:56] kind charity enth
[29:04] not no
[29:08] is
[29:25] oh am no is
[29:30] charity vth not
[29:41] itself is not puffed
[29:46] up do not behave itself
[29:52] unseemly seeketh not her
[29:57] own
[29:59] is not easily
[30:02] provoked think no
[30:07] evil rejoices not in
[30:15] iniquity but rejoices in the
[30:21] truth beareth all
[30:24] things believeth all
[30:26] things
[30:30] hopeth all
[30:33] things and endureth all
[30:38] [Music]
[30:40] things we'll read up to there I
[30:54] apologize uh now you know that in my
[30:56] testimony I wasn't in the denomination
[30:59] for many
[31:08] years and in the denomination they teach
[31:10] us more uh more about the New
[31:15] Testament such as the Epistles of the
[31:17] Apostle
[31:18] Paul and the Apostle
[31:21] Peter the book of
[31:24] Acts the first
[31:26] church
[31:28] the first
[31:33] Christians and they would hardly ever
[31:36] get into the Old
[31:49] Testament when I barely got started and
[31:52] was newly baptized I asked there in the
[31:56] denomination
[32:03] I would ask about the Book of Genesis
[32:04] the Book of Joshua and all of
[32:12] that and their only reply was not to try
[32:15] to be so
[32:25] complicated uh just keep it simple just
[32:27] go through the letters of the New
[32:29] Testament and just to have my life
[32:31] follow
[32:36] that so what I just read and it's
[32:38] something that touched my
[32:43] heart it's something that we really we
[32:46] live we really lived through uh while we
[32:48] were in the
[32:52] denomination because Brothers you must
[32:54] also
[32:56] understand
[32:59] that this serves as a base for every one
[33:01] of
[33:04] us because it doesn't matter how much of
[33:08] a good preacher you are if you don't
[33:10] have love then it won't
[33:17] work if you play the piano or the other
[33:20] drums or well but if you don't have love
[33:22] then it won't
[33:23] work it won't have the outcome that you
[33:26] want
[33:30] all things must be done in
[33:32] love and if you don't know
[33:36] love that's where you have to
[33:39] start I
[33:41] apologize if you think otherwise I'm
[33:48] sorry and the ones that are watching
[33:53] online if you also think otherwise then
[33:55] I
[33:56] apologize
[33:59] but love comes
[34:10] first so we'll be uh laying this as our
[34:12] base so we can get into the message that
[34:14] way we don't take so
[34:18] long I wanted to say that we really uh
[34:21] uh enjoyed ourselves on
[34:25] Sunday with the preaching that our
[34:27] pastor brought
[34:29] us and with the
[34:36] songs and if on that Sunday you didn't
[34:38] leave this place being full of the
[34:41] spirit I don't know what then will be
[34:43] able to fill
[34:48] you but that day the Holy Spirit
[34:51] manifested
[34:53] itself it was just for you to
[34:56] say
[35:01] Lord Heal Me from this or give me
[35:04] this that I need and the Holy Spirit
[35:06] would have given it to you
[35:09] there obviously if you first believe
[35:12] it
[35:23] well so the introduction to this message
[35:26] the title is uh disease and
[35:36] afflictions uh I would like to First
[35:37] mention the great uh breakthroughs that
[35:39] there have been in science
[35:45] first so many new medicines to heal have
[35:47] been
[35:53] found like never before even about
[35:56] thousands uh thousands of years
[36:01] ago uh today we have the greatest
[36:04] breakthroughs or advances in
[36:10] medicine if you didn't know open heart
[36:13] surgeries are performed
[36:16] now they uh they perform organ
[36:19] transplants as
[36:23] well uh organs like the
[36:26] kidneys
[36:28] the liver the heart the
[36:32] lungs and something that's very
[36:36] cheap there's a actually a waiting
[36:40] list so if there is a
[36:43] donor to be able to get a
[36:46] kidney or something
[36:56] similar
[37:00] and I also want to mention that
[37:01] currently thousands of hospitals have
[37:03] been
[37:05] built thousands of
[37:08] clinics uh there's red
[37:10] crosses blue
[37:14] crosses uh throughout the entire
[37:18] world there's thousands and millions of
[37:21] doctors infas
[37:24] nurses
[37:25] laborator uh lab uh
[37:34] doctors you know they draw some blood to
[37:37] be able to check your blood to see if
[37:38] you have high cholesterol or you know so
[37:43] on uh thousands of years ago there was
[37:46] no La
[37:52] physician neither would they draw your
[37:54] blood with the needle to be able to
[37:55] check if you had high cholesterol
[37:59] now all that today uh is something that
[38:01] is
[38:03] checked they make all kinds of
[38:08] tests it's an entire Army that is
[38:11] fighting against
[38:17] diseases uh nevertheless I was reading
[38:20] in a very reliable
[38:26] article that said 90% of the worldwide
[38:33] population dies every year and is
[38:39] sick it's so many
[38:43] people that die uh because of
[38:49] cancer obviously it uh shows itself in
[38:53] different
[38:56] ways
[38:58] some say that calling cancer is the one
[39:00] that is at the very
[39:02] top and then the list goes
[39:06] on the list goes on and there's no need
[39:09] to mention every one of
[39:12] them uh there's a lot of people that
[39:14] have
[39:17] strokes and with the covid-19
[39:23] virus I believe that every one of us at
[39:26] our homes
[39:30] we went through that
[39:33] experience if you never had
[39:37] co9 well then praise God for
[39:40] you that you didn't have to go through
[39:42] that
[39:45] experience but 19 even uh infected
[39:54] me and I do thank God I wasn't infected
[39:57] but it wasn't that
[40:03] severe and we know that millions of
[40:05] people have died
[40:10] worldwide and still this disease is uh
[40:13] unable to be
[40:17] eradicated it's something that's very uh
[40:19] latent uh in our
[40:22] midst and it has a lot of
[40:25] variables that can can affect
[40:30] us and so I ask myself the
[40:36] question why is uh what's the use of
[40:38] having so many medical
[40:43] breakthroughs what's the purpose of
[40:45] having a lot of hospitals with so many
[40:48] floors
[40:49] High
[40:52] everywhere in every city and every
[40:56] country
[40:59] if there's no nothing there's nothing
[41:01] that you can heal covid-19
[41:04] with they make up
[41:12] vaccines and those same vaccines they
[41:15] have after effects or side
[41:18] effects because they've made a vaccines
[41:21] even for
[41:26] vapor
[41:27] a vaccine has to be in a time frame of
[41:29] 10 20
[41:31] years testing with
[41:35] people until you can finally eradicate
[41:38] the
[41:40] disease I'm
[41:43] sorry the first question that we ask
[41:46] ourselves
[41:48] is why does disease
[41:54] come have you ever asked yourself why is
[41:56] it that disease Jesus
[42:00] come you'll learn
[42:05] tonight you'll learn
[42:12] tonight William Bram in the message
[42:15] diseases and afflictions from uh the
[42:18] message of William
[42:23] Branham paragraph number
[42:25] 23 this is
[42:27] it says like
[42:33] this he says diseases and afflictions
[42:36] are all the results of
[42:39] sin maybe not in your
[42:44] life but in someone but in somebody's
[42:48] life before
[42:52] you the devil is the author of sickness
[42:55] and afflictions
[42:58] I I'll repeat
[43:04] it the devil is the author of sickness
[43:08] and
[43:10] afflictions before we had any
[43:14] devil we had no
[43:16] sickness or
[43:20] afflictions but when Satan
[43:26] came he brought with him sickness and
[43:29] afflictions
[43:32] brothers that's the
[43:39] answer now there's characters in uh the
[43:41] word of
[43:43] God uh like in the case of
[43:51] job that we can see here that it was
[43:53] God's permissive
[43:56] will
[44:00] that he God allowed Satan to come into
[44:02] job's
[44:14] body because the Lord said there is no
[44:17] one on earth that is so perfect and so
[44:19] great as
[44:20] job he's fearful of
[44:25] God so then what did Satan
[44:32] reply he says uh job fears God because
[44:35] you put a hedge around
[44:40] him he has so many things he has cattles
[44:43] and so
[44:47] on but take that all away from him and
[44:50] he will curse you before your
[44:56] face
[44:58] so that's where God's uh permission came
[45:00] that he gave to
[45:02] Satan to be able to touch
[45:13] job Regard in his infinite will and
[45:18] wisdom he knew what he was going to do
[45:20] with
[45:23] job you know that the lord gave
[45:25] everything back to him
[45:27] and uh even twofold amen
[45:37] amen Let's uh corroborate all of this uh
[45:40] let's go to the Book of Romans
[45:48] 6:23 the Bible in Romans says for the
[45:51] wages of sin is
[45:55] death for the wages of sin is
[46:00] death and now the question is how does
[46:03] Death
[46:05] come it comes through
[46:08] diseases and why do we get
[46:11] sick because of
[46:14] sin Adam and
[46:18] Eve they were
[46:22] Eternal they didn't have any diseases or
[46:25] anything they lived such a happy
[46:31] life but
[46:35] Satan using the
[46:41] serpent or the serpent rather being
[46:43] anointed by
[46:45] Satan deceived the woman amen
[46:50] amen how many can say Amen to that
[46:55] GL
[47:02] so he deceived the woman and then the
[47:04] woman gave uh to the man to gave to eat
[47:07] to the
[47:09] man now remember this very
[47:13] closely the woman was
[47:16] deceived by the
[47:19] serpent that was anointed by
[47:22] Satan but Adam was not
[47:25] deceived did you know that
[47:28] Adam was not
[47:32] deceived he willfully
[47:38] sinned because he could have very well
[47:41] said you're wrong to his
[47:47] wife and could have stopped sin and and
[47:49] sickness
[47:51] there all of us we inherited
[47:55] diseases all of
[47:59] mankind it was for
[48:02] everyone in that moment that's when we
[48:05] all
[48:06] fell we're a fallen
[48:09] race because of
[48:14] sin it was something that was
[48:17] Universal we all
[48:19] died little
[48:23] children uh
[48:25] grownups
[48:27] uh religious people with a high
[48:31] morale and as well them that disobey
[48:35] and have are depraved they also
[48:40] die that's the uh the outcome of Adam's
[48:47] sin many were established as
[48:51] Sinners because of the transgression of
[48:55] one
[48:58] condemnation for all men
[49:04] came and that sinful condition is our
[49:07] inheritance that we have received from
[49:11] Adam but Grace is what makes the
[49:16] difference between Adam's
[49:20] condemnation and justification that is
[49:23] in Christ Jesus amen amen so
[49:28] we
[49:30] are therefore Justified if you believe
[49:33] in the Lord Jesus
[49:34] Christ if you're born
[49:40] again you have the forg the forgiveness
[49:43] for that
[49:49] sin the uh Lord says that your sins are
[49:52] sent to the sea of forgetfulness to the
[49:55] abyss
[49:58] and now you can go in directly to speak
[50:00] with the Lord
[50:05] amen you can once again have the
[50:07] connection that they once had in the
[50:10] beginning Adam and Eve with
[50:13] God that's where we go back
[50:16] to when we
[50:20] accept our Lord Jesus
[50:23] Christ when we believe him
[50:28] because that's very important
[50:30] Brothers we must believe
[50:35] him and the brother the brother in the
[50:37] back is going like this does that mean
[50:39] my time is up
[50:42] no
[50:44] okay okay gracias I'm fine thank
[50:55] you
[50:59] uh the second question that I would ask
[51:01] myself
[51:10] is the question is when you receive your
[51:13] healing Your Divine Healing from God how
[51:15] long does it
[51:25] last
[51:27] we're going to go to paragraph 27 to get
[51:29] the answer in the same message of these
[51:31] uh diseases and
[51:36] afflictions paragraph 27
[51:45] says he says they last as long as Faith
[51:53] lasts he says but when Faith fails then
[51:56] your healing will
[52:05] fail he said would you say every person
[52:08] came to the Altar and got converted
[52:10] would be a Christian all their
[52:14] days that's a question that brother Bram
[52:16] is
[52:21] asking and he says he could be a tonight
[52:24] A Child of
[52:25] God
[52:28] and tomorrow be a child of the
[52:33] devil it's when he loses his faith in
[52:37] God what sends him
[52:45] back and in paragraph 28 he says and any
[52:48] power that could heal you
[52:51] here at this
[52:54] platform can keep you well
[52:58] that's the reason I made this
[53:04] statement that nothing comes here but
[53:06] what is delivered
[53:12] here outside here it's according to your
[53:15] faith whether it
[53:19] stays I hope that we're able to
[53:21] understand this very
[53:25] clearly
[53:27] if you come to Elders
[53:31] prayer the brothers and sisters that
[53:33] come up to the
[53:40] altar so that the ERS can pray over you
[53:43] for a a disease or a trial or something
[53:46] that you're going
[53:49] through you have to be sure that God
[53:54] exists sure it's here
[53:58] present in our
[54:01] midst and you're fully trusting in
[54:06] Him because you must come
[54:10] believing as God's word
[54:14] says if you remember Hebrews
[54:20] 111 faith is the substance of things hop
[54:25] for
[54:27] the evidence of Things Not
[54:31] Seen because if your faith
[54:35] fails your healing will also
[54:40] fail and the disease will come back to
[54:42] your
[54:45] body this is something that the prophet
[54:49] said and the prophet brought us the last
[54:52] thing for this
[54:54] age on behalf of of
[55:02] God and none of us is able to deny the
[55:05] gift that God gave the prophet amen
[55:14] amen now the number one disease in the
[55:17] entire world
[55:18] Brothers is
[55:22] cancer and it's in its different
[55:25] variable uh state stages or
[55:28] form in the organs of our body
[55:32] tumors uh cataracts ulceras ulcers
[55:37] pneumonia pneumonias tuberculosis
[55:44] tuberculosis there's H so many names
[55:46] that uh science has given to these
[55:50] diseases that doctors have named
[55:55] them
[55:58] nevertheless the Lord Jesus Christ has
[55:59] said that they're
[56:02] demons diseases are
[56:07] demons spiritually
[56:14] speaking we'll be reading in paragraph
[56:16] 36 from the same
[56:23] message because it's really important to
[56:25] know what the messenger says
[56:28] canc about
[56:37] cancer he starts off by saying there are
[56:40] three that bear record in
[56:43] heaven he says now when
[56:46] we're our
[56:52] conversion the element came from Jesus
[56:54] Christ's body
[56:57] when he
[57:01] died there was water blood and
[57:08] spirit and these three things make up
[57:10] the new
[57:12] birth is that right
[57:18] ministers these three elements make up
[57:20] the new
[57:22] birth water blood and spirit
[57:28] that make up the natural
[57:31] birth when a baby is
[57:34] born what's the first
[57:38] thing water blood
[57:43] life all the Natural
[57:46] Things type the
[57:51] spiritual and a cancer in the
[57:55] natural in the spiritual he's a
[58:00] devil he types the
[58:02] scavenger and a
[58:05] Buzzard eats dead
[58:10] things the cancer comes from a
[58:14] bruise that's what the prophet
[58:17] says he says cancer comes from a
[58:25] bruise
[58:28] for instance my
[58:30] hand it hasn't got any cancer on
[58:35] it and it may have
[58:39] sometime well what causes a
[58:44] cancer is some
[58:49] cell germ in my body
[58:54] backslides gets bruised or something
[58:56] sets
[59:01] in and from that germ or cell it starts
[59:04] a multipli multiplication of
[59:09] cells multiplying and it forms the
[59:14] cancer and it starts eating into the
[59:21] body now all every life and every kind
[59:23] of life doesn't matter how small it is
[59:27] it comes from a
[59:31] germ you yourself you come from a
[59:38] germ you on one occasion you came and
[59:40] when you came you were a single
[59:46] germ tiny little germ that cannot be
[59:48] seen with a natural
[59:51] eye you came from your
[59:55] father
[59:57] you don't come from your mother's blood
[59:59] at
[1:00:02] all the blood cell comes from the male
[1:00:08] sex and then from that germ cells begin
[1:00:12] to
[1:00:14] multiply and uh every fourth every seed
[1:00:17] according to its
[1:00:20] kind a germ from the dog will bring
[1:00:22] forth a
[1:00:24] dog from a bird a
[1:00:28] bird and a human a
[1:00:32] human if nothing interrupts that God's
[1:00:40] program nothing interrupts it it'll
[1:00:42] bring forth a perfect normal
[1:00:47] child and it will grow to be a perfect
[1:00:50] normal
[1:00:52] adult if nothing interrupts it
[1:01:01] but when something interrupts it then
[1:01:03] it's bound to be the evil that
[1:01:05] interrupts God's
[1:01:10] program God didn't intend you to be
[1:01:17] sick God Made You in his
[1:01:23] likeness can we read in Genesis 126 if
[1:01:26] you open your
[1:01:29] Bibles
[1:01:31] genis
[1:01:43] genesis6 oh
[1:01:54] Christ
[1:02:01] [Music]
[1:02:04] Genesis
[1:02:24] 1:26
[1:02:26] and God said let us make man in our
[1:02:28] image after our likeness and let them
[1:02:30] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[1:02:32] and over the foul of the air and over
[1:02:34] the cattle and all and over all the
[1:02:37] Earth and over every creeping thing that
[1:02:39] creepeth upon the Earth
[1:02:49] amen so God created man in his own image
[1:02:52] in the image of God created he him
[1:02:55] mailing female created he
[1:03:06] them so in paragraph 41 of the message
[1:03:08] that we're currently
[1:03:13] reading the prophet said God didn't
[1:03:15] intend you to be
[1:03:19] sick he says God Made You in his
[1:03:24] likeness he wants you to to be
[1:03:30] well he's done everything he can to keep
[1:03:33] you
[1:03:36] well and he says and Satan is against
[1:03:44] you therefore this cancer he starts or
[1:03:48] tumor whatever it
[1:03:51] is from a germ he begins to multiply
[1:03:58] like a tumor becomes malignant and so
[1:04:01] forth It's a
[1:04:03] body just like
[1:04:05] you just like you're of a
[1:04:10] body it has a spirit just like you are a
[1:04:14] spirit it's a
[1:04:16] spirit only it it has not a
[1:04:21] soul a cancer is a
[1:04:24] germ
[1:04:27] that it starts multiplying itself
[1:04:30] cells and it starts eating up the
[1:04:34] body and it's a
[1:04:36] soul rather it's a spirit amen
[1:04:41] amen and we also come from a single
[1:04:47] germ but now the difference is that we
[1:04:50] do have a
[1:04:52] soul cancer does not have a soul
[1:05:04] there's only two Realms that that
[1:05:06] product can come
[1:05:10] from God's kingdom or realm or Satan's
[1:05:16] kingdom so this cancer it comes from
[1:05:20] Satan because God wants you to be
[1:05:23] well for you to be healthy
[1:05:28] for you to live an Abundant
[1:05:32] Life what the Lord Jesus Christ comes to
[1:05:34] mind what he
[1:05:39] said he said Satan only comes to uh
[1:05:42] steal destroy and
[1:05:45] lie he says but I have come so that you
[1:05:47] may have
[1:05:49] life and life abundantly amen
[1:05:54] amen he wants you to be
[1:05:59] happy from you not to suffer with any
[1:06:02] ailment for you not to have any
[1:06:07] pain there's no reason for us to accept
[1:06:10] any kind of
[1:06:14] pain you can turn it down with all your
[1:06:20] strength whatever
[1:06:23] pain headache or kidney pain whatever it
[1:06:25] is you can
[1:06:29] reject and
[1:06:31] you to Satan that's up up until there
[1:06:34] that no more I don't want anymore this
[1:06:37] is not something that's for
[1:06:39] me I am a child of
[1:06:42] God my God wants me
[1:06:46] healthy my God wants the best for
[1:06:51] me so you with your
[1:06:54] mouth you know that your mouth it
[1:06:56] carries the
[1:06:58] power your words are very important
[1:07:04] amen because if we're complaining every
[1:07:08] day and we're just uh petting or or just
[1:07:12] being uh very sensible to that
[1:07:17] pain that pain will become more
[1:07:19] excruciating instead of going
[1:07:22] away but if you reject it
[1:07:27] and you keep rejecting it and rejecting
[1:07:29] it and rejecting
[1:07:31] it it's going to go like
[1:07:33] this
[1:07:35] amen believe
[1:07:42] [Music]
[1:07:49] it because that's the first thing that
[1:07:52] you must do is believe
[1:07:54] it
[1:07:56] because we live by
[1:07:58] faith we're here by
[1:08:04] faith as long as you're declaring that
[1:08:07] you're a child of
[1:08:11] God and you're a holder of all the
[1:08:13] promises of the
[1:08:17] Lord with you saying by his stripes we
[1:08:20] were
[1:08:22] healed and you stand on that word
[1:08:26] Satan has to
[1:08:28] flee he has to
[1:08:32] flee he can't stand or be against the
[1:08:37] word the Lord Jesus Christ said to him
[1:08:39] it is
[1:08:43] written Thou shalt worship and serve
[1:08:45] only thy
[1:08:49] God he says well I'll offer to you all
[1:08:52] the kingdom of the
[1:08:54] world if if you just uh Bow Down and
[1:08:56] Worship
[1:09:00] me the Lord Jesus Christ said it is
[1:09:10] written so it's very important that you
[1:09:13] in your heart and in your mind you
[1:09:16] remember God's word because God's word
[1:09:18] is your
[1:09:19] Shield that uh Shields around
[1:09:24] you and the Lord will be the lifter of
[1:09:26] your
[1:09:29] head as it says in Psalms chapter
[1:09:32] 3 he is our
[1:09:36] Shield he is the lifter of our
[1:09:39] head no one
[1:09:44] else maybe you have uh faith in home
[1:09:51] remedies you placed your faith in some
[1:09:54] doctor or some person
[1:09:59] no one else will heal you only
[1:10:01] God so uh just
[1:10:04] memorize only he can
[1:10:07] heal no one else can heal
[1:10:13] besides and the prophet said it it's
[1:10:15] something that you can clearly see in
[1:10:16] his
[1:10:19] messages he only have the gift that God
[1:10:22] gave
[1:10:24] him
[1:10:30] but the angel of the Lord had to be
[1:10:32] there because if he
[1:10:36] wasn't then brother Bram would say if
[1:10:38] the angel isn't here if I can't feel him
[1:10:40] then I'll just go
[1:10:42] home because God is the one that heals
[1:10:44] amen
[1:10:47] amen as our Pastor said on
[1:10:53] Sunday everything has to be orderly
[1:10:57] there has to be order set in the
[1:11:00] church there has to be order in our
[1:11:04] homes order in our jobs
[1:11:10] amen there's uh things that don't
[1:11:12] require too
[1:11:14] much you are able to realize
[1:11:19] yourself I must have my house in
[1:11:24] order
[1:11:26] not necessarily with good hygiene and
[1:11:29] have it have it nice and
[1:11:33] neat but in our interpersonal
[1:11:38] relationships with our wives children
[1:11:42] grandchildren great grandchildren and so
[1:11:46] on your very conscience is dictating
[1:11:49] that to
[1:11:51] you now our time is up
[1:11:54] Brothers
[1:11:57] I I wasn't able to get to the point that
[1:11:59] I wanted to get to and tell
[1:12:04] you but I hope we learned something
[1:12:09] tonight I I personally learned a
[1:12:15] lot and I'm hoping that the brothers
[1:12:17] that are watching
[1:12:19] online we're also able to
[1:12:23] learn and if you want to come come to
[1:12:25] this
[1:12:27] place and surrender your life to the
[1:12:29] Lord Jesus Christ we're
[1:12:35] here that's a Great Commission that the
[1:12:37] Lord left
[1:12:41] us to take the gospel to Every
[1:12:46] Creature if these few words have
[1:12:49] impacted
[1:12:50] you we'll be waiting for you
[1:12:53] here with open arms
[1:12:59] just a few uh
[1:13:04] lines seek ye the kingdom of
[1:13:08] Christ strive to enter
[1:13:13] in you that have not come into the
[1:13:18] kingdom search Christ as your
[1:13:24] shelter
[1:13:25] as long as there's time and you have the
