[Music] I place myself in your hands and my brother Louise so all of us may be blessed by Your Word we asked for all of this in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen [Music] just like if you're standing we can open up our Bibles to Jeremiah 32 6. yeah we're going to start on verse six Jeremiah 32 6. and Jeremiah said the word of the Lord came unto me saying behold the son of Shalom shall come unto thee saying by by thee my field that is in anathoth for the right of redemption is is dying to buy it my uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the Lord and said unto me by my field I pray thee that is anathoth which is the country of Benjamin for the right of the inheritance is thine and the Redemption is thine buy it for thyself then I know that this was the word of the Lord is and I bought the field of animals my uncle's son that was in anathoth and await him the money even 17 shekels of silver embalances and I subscribe the evidence and sealed it and took the witnesses and weighed him the money and the balances so I took the evidence of the purchase both that which was sealed according to the law and custom that which was open area and I gave the evidence of the purchase onto Barack the son of naraya the son of Messiah and the side of hanamel my uncle's son and in the presence of the witnesses that described the book of the purchase before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison and I charged Barack before them saying is the god of Israel take these evidence and the evidence of the purchase both which is sealed and this evidence will just open and put them in the Earthen vessel that they may continue many days of his word you may take your seats I'd like to speak on the 14th verse where it says there was two uh letters or two purchases the evidence of the purchase that was sealed is and this evidence which is open so these two portions were placed in an Earthen vessel now brother Bram says in the message Gabriel's instructions to Daniel in the Old Testament property could not be or could not be held any longer than 50 days 50 years the your 50th is the Year of Jubilee esta Del due original por Mazda cincuenta you cannot be annihilated from its original owner but 50 years and on the 40th Day he paid the price and on the 50th day of the Redemption and the power that belonged to the church that was lost in the Garden of Eden foreign [Music] it says shows where the power of God and the Scrolls and the secrets of God is known in the heart or Plan of Redemption the same being kept in Earthly vessels Jesus name and the Revelation so when Jeremiah took the open portion and the sealed portion and place that an Eartha places the open portions and the portion that sealed at the plan of his Redemption [Music] he places it in our human hearts una Persona a person can have both portions in the use in them this is more important now that's very important una Persona a person can have both portions being reflected through their heart foreign for all of them that believe in him shall not be lost but have eternal life now there's two sides or portions to Redemption and this scripture shows it but it explains it a bit more there's an open part yeah and there's a sealed part now this example of this open portion and the portion that's sealed uh that can be applied or explained through many portions of the Bible explain a lot of things in the message and in the in the Bible but since we're Limited in time I want to take I'll only take one example and that is the rainbows if you can up your Bibles to Second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 6 and 7. we spoke on both portions and that we have those two portions in our hearts second Corinthians 4 6. and we're also speaking about the rainbow now rainbow gives out colors of light is for God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness and shine in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ [Music] reflects Darkness or reflex reflects light your heart is can reflect the rainbow now what is a rainbow sacrifice has been accepted that you have accepted the sacrifice of Jesus Christ now if you accept the sacrifice of Jesus Christ now that reflects the rainbow through your heart now the seventh verse it says so we have this treasure and Earthen vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us because we are Earth and vessels we can have both portions of redemption now in us we can reflect the light that we have is that that is through our heart the 12th verse now this is After the flood with Noah the 12th verse it says and God said this is the token of the Covenant which I made between me and you and every living creature that is with you for Perpetual generations and I do set my bowl in the cloud and there shall be for a token for a covenant between me and the Earth you see notice on 13th verse says the ball the rainbow is the token of the Covenant that is God's covenant that he made with Earth they're not just they explain our lights not the 14th verse this is when I bring a cloud over the Earth that the bow shall be seen in the cloud we noticed we said there's two portions there's an open portion and there is a sealed portion now there's a rainbow there's a cabinet that is available to all for us who are here on Earth every person that's here on Earth Cristiano Christians atheists believer or unbelievable if you believe in God or you don't believe in God everyone can see the rainbow there's an open portion in God's covenants that can benefit the whole world but there is a sealed portion of God's covenant beneficiar that it only benefits one single person and that is the bride as for the whole world and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it is for this is my blood of the test of the new testament which is said for many of remission of sins now the blood is a blood of the of the Covenant and the rainbow it is my brother random went to the restaurant and there was an elderly lady there with two police officers the second that blood that blood of Christ is the only thing that keeps the wrath of God off of us tonight there's an open portion the benefits the whole world the blood of Jesus Christ that right now it protects everyone in the whole world from God's Wrath for now how would I Tiempo because of time I'm gonna go to paragraph eight eight we know that brother Brandon repented right and he asked Jesus to forgive him in paragraph a brother says and I said I was the one who did that will you forgive me Jesus and when God forgave brother Branham he said he took his hand and he dipped it inside why on his side because in the cross they pierced aside and what came out of there his church came out forgetfulness never to remember it against me no more now what Jesus did is biblical it is it talks about the high priest and Jesus is our high priest and sprinkle it with his finger upon The Mercy Seat Eastward and before the mercy seat shout he sprinkle of blood with his finger seven times through his finger in the blood seven times Revelation chapter four part three it says Eastward where was the sacrifice place as oriente towards the east as many as could to bring papers and so forth to get these maps in a few minutes he said all right sprinkle it eastwards and before the mercy seat shall be he sprinkled that isn't that wonderful seven times towards the east what is it is the seven Church ages shall be covered by the blood so one brother random asked for forgiveness is right here what he's telling us right now so Jesus and pardoning him the blood of Jesus Christ is sufficient yesterday boy today and forever and to every age to save every sinner here every sick person bring every Miracle every sign to pass seven times way back Yonder in the Old Testament milk 490 years before Christ came aura as we just saw Cristo it was Christ that took his finger and dipped it in the blood what does the finger represent in Lucas and Luke 11 20 says but if I was the Finger of God cast out Devils no doubt the kingdom of God has come upon you know we know the four Gospels it speaks about the same thing that Jesus spoke but in different different aspects now and Lucas says the Finger of God foreign but if I cast out the Devils by the spirit of God then the kingdom of God has come come unto you now what does their finger represent it is the spirit of God Jesus so when God took his finger and dipped it inside and pardon brother Branham so when the high priest would take his fingers it will sprinkle it seven times it will speak of Jesus Christ that physically he's up there but it takes the spirit and he applies the blood seven times to the seven Church ages that is what the finger represents is God's spirit that applies the blood there's a there's a drop of blood for Paul irino Martin iridius Martin Luther Columbus Wesley Wesley and for brother Branham or proudly displaying the blood of Jesus Christ upon their chest the message of God and the hour that they lived in so in every age it had his message that message came the power of the blood through the through the blood of Jesus about the blood of God I purchased our salvation portion now in that open portion that one has to pray but uh so another person can be saved just like you fathers and mothers you're praying so your children can be saved you pray so you can receive your healing benefits and God's covenant is a higher you don't no longer have to pray you no longer have to have a vision just speak it not anyone can use that portion only mature people it's not the one the size tough shot for me to use that power now if you listen to the tapes it was goddess and his Sovereign Grace that told him to do it is decided to do it portion okay are you not are you not quiris abierto now there's an open rainbow yeah and there's a sealed rainbow all right and the message shows the father in outside of space then I see it in Revelation 1. when the rainbow was across the throne where Jesus was standing a covenant God had made with his people he was to look upon a Jasper and sardia stone there's no time to to speak on these stones but this is the first and the last which is in shall come the root and offspring of David the Morning Star come on as a rainbow it has a Grace the grace of Salvation as the only Grace that has an open portion now that open portion noise it's not complete without the other portions now you need both portions you need both Grace what is the first Grace or the second is rapturing Grace now there's a a initiative or a beginning Grace now there's a ending or a Finnish Grace now the first Grace the Salvation it gives salvation second grace it gives you the faith of rapture and we'll enter that in a bit now the reason why there's an open portion and there's a sealed portion when we speak about the rainbow everybody here in this world and this everybody in this world can see the rainbow but there's another rainbow that's not here on Earth and that and since not everyone is going to go to heaven they can't see the second portion of the rainbow the first rainbow is there in heaven middle and now even brother Branham ministerio in this ministry had an open portion and he had a sealed portion in his ministry but there's not time to get into it but we're going to touch it a bit healing campaigns just a little rim of hair around his head no preachers and they had a have a conference up there on account of not having it in the South because they they had both colored and white together and this old fellow was standing there and all the ministers that they have been preaching on what Jesus done and so forth but he never take it he took the text over in job somewhere there where it said where were you when I laid the foundations of the world and when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy president well where the ministers was bringing the activities of the church on Earth he went up to the heavens Plumbing back downtown Millions years before the world was even foreign [Music] but he was a fountain of seven colors because there's a rainbow in heaven 38 what was that when I lay the foundations of the earth declare if thou has understanding who has laid the measures thereof without knows or who had stretched the line upon it is all the foundations therefore fast and who lay the Cornerstone thereof okay there's two portions of redemption there's a Cornerstone yeah and there's the headstone foreign it's also called the constellation of Seven Sisters did they form One Cloud here came a flood at Jeffersonville in Jeffersonville during that time of the floods because he reject to receive that open portion in Grace I am now there's bitterness that a Christian has to go through and that open Ministry that brother Branham you turn to you who turn judgment to Wormwood and leave of righteousness leave off righteousness in the earth is but it's also an angel for the Waters of the sea and pour them out upon the face of the earth now if you search the message now the angel that started began the flood there with Noah was bitter Waters now the Bible says in Revelations 8 11. this is and the name of the star is called wormwood and the third part of the waters became wormwood and many men died of the waters because they were made bitter avier so the open portion of the ministry of brother Branham he went through bitter Waters because he first rejected to fulfill that portion but there's another bitterness on that sealed portion but the bitterness it should not hold you back there will always be bitterness but these bitterness or trials that come to your life because you accepted the blood of Jesus Christ you accepted the rainbow you have said that the Covenant you accepted his grace and being that you accepted the Devon comes with his bitterness to serve God bitterness will come now there are two portions there's two rainbows the first rainbow of the seven churches are the Seven Seals immediately is this item in his office if you notice it's in the form of a rainbow in form of a bow or an arch there's two portions like brother Branham says there's two halves two halves this is a complete circle now the first half is on the earth that's why we can all see it but the second half it's not on Earth it's in the heavens but it's half of a complete circle it's not all of it now this this candlesticks solamente is one half of the Redemption there's a second half she said the last time that I spoke we spoke about the Holy place and the holies of holies now this is in the Holy place now the other rainbow is there around the Throne of God and those gracias there's two Grace Grace not everyone would be raptured not everyone can benefit from that Grace portion and as you know it's just a manifestation of the seven and angels of the seven churches but there are seven other seals that's on the back side of the book it's outside the Bible if you read in Revelations says the book was still from in and out in Jeremiah this is it's an open letter and it's a sealed letter now there's two portions now this this candlesticks now that's only one half La salvation Salvation is now these candlesticks are it's the rainbow you know the one could see from here on Earth this is the message I think a man's filter one day he was out there in nature yeah this is what happened up there when the angels of the Lord appeared to me one morning yes and then squirrels were spoken to existence all of you remember when it was taking place and also just at top of the hill where I was standing was where just before preaching the seven Church ages I thought the sun was coming up candlesticks standing upon there on top of the hill come on you're worth like a rainbow Traverse was coming up through the pipes and feeding out so the seven churches like here like it's represented here these candlesticks it's the first rainbow it's here on Earth everyone can see this rainbow now if it will rain today we can all see the rainbow who produces who makes that rainbow dios God does it everyone can see that rainbow creentes Believers Incredibles and unbelievers but there's a second rainbow not everyone can see that one remember in your heart you can reflect the both portions in your heart you reflect the Covenant you reflect the rainbows in your heart one person can have both portions now in Isaiah 30 26 this is more of the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun and the light of the sun shall be Sevenfold as the light of seven days and the day of the light the day of the Lord binded up the bridge of his people and healeth the stroke of their wound all right several years we spoke about the lunar or the rainbow of the Moon La Luna the Moon it brings forth life it has capacity to make or bring forth the rainbow this is the seven Church ages and it talks about seven moons the light of the moon it's not its own life it's the light of the sun Jesus Christ is the son the the church is the Moon here on Earth but remember there's another rainbow so let's read on the second rainbow in Apocalypse and Revelations 4 El versicolono verse one this is after this I looked and behold the door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as they were a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be here Hereafter yeah and I wish you all know by now that the first verse is the rapture amen amen because Christ is the door the voice that he uses is voice of Archangel the trumpet is what calls it up so verse one is the rapture the first rainbow Esther in heaven but to be able to see the second rainbow one has to go up to heaven to see the second rainbow it requires a rapture now even in the natural s the rainbows that we see we're going to see one half because we're here on Earth but if you go up high up in their in the skies it's like there's there's Pilots that have seen Pilots airplane pilots that I've seen a complete rainbow why because they're so high up in the skies you can see a complete circle to see the rainbows of the seven churches to see the second half of the rainbow he had to come up higher he had to be raptured of the rainbow that's why brother Branham was raptured when that rainbow came because it was that sealed portion of God's covenants of God's covenant is Rapture in Greece not everyone can receive that portion solo La Novia only the bride that's why a human being that's part of the Bride Can reflect both portions through their hearts like brother Branham since he had both Graces he could give the grace of Salvation because God healing Resurrection resurrection of all those things that we just finished speaking about well that's why not everyone can see the second half of the rainbow foreign in your heart in Revelation chapter two and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and at once sat on the throne and he said was look up when he said it would look like a pond like a Jasper and starting Stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne and sight like upon onto Emerald it was a complete rainbow it wasn't just one half this is a rainbow around about The Throne I have an image where it shows it shows a complete rainbow instrumental that one but this one you have to see it in an elevated position not everyone can see a complete false rainbows not everyone can receive both portions by the God's grace it has both Graces it has the first half and the second half this is Revelation chapter 4 part 2. now if you notice seven watch seven rainbows seven colors I mean I mean I want to say seven color rainbows that meant seven bows seven churches reflecting seven lights each light wrapped into into the other one it started off with the red is red after red come orange which is a reflection of red this President is which is red and orange mixed together green and blue makes black indigo then comes Indigo you know then from Indigo come Violet which is part of blue Allelujah no buenos Hallelujah don't you see it is a covenant that through seven Church ages seven colors that he will save the Earth we got the first portion of the rainbow with the seven Church ages it's salvation the second portion is Rapture in Greece what would he do recorded remember he made it with it with it on the Earth it's half of a circle he covered the Earth just makes an ark solo is just half of it is that's the church ages oh when John saw him in that Amber color amber the color amber Alo he's surrounded and covered around like a Halo now this candlesticks are The Messengers now there's an eighth he's of those eighth number eight is number of Eternity so then the eighth messenger has to come from eternity because the messengers were born from Earth is not born from the earth Came From Heaven Christ but the word that he brings is a complete circle so you believe in the eighth messenger it's a human being no it's not so Cristo Christ is the eighth messenger that he calls it the age of the Bride our soul is already there in eternity you reflect las dos gracias both Graces but your body it's still here on Earth and he set his right foot upon the sea and left foot upon the Earth that book has two portions and the voice which I heard from Heaven spoke to me unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth if this is and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but in thy mouth sweet as honey how can one person have both portions eating the book make your belly bitter and that seal portion the administrative and the ministry of brother Branham he had another bitterness is of his belly foreign was raptured ultimasita now one last quote the sudden sugar going away of the church if you can please stand before reading the quote I've always said that in your heart you can have both rainbows the most detailed message concerning the rainbow Lo hablo el primero Uno and the first of January of 1961. so there's a pastor asked if I could speak to the church two rainbows came here to Phoenix that was number five in the afternoon two rainbows appeared here in the city of Phoenix I'm not sure those who are here remember yes and those two rainbows those two rainbows appeared over the tomb of brother Johnny I have some images that they can please place it there is a Rapture in Grace going away of the church this is now let us take the way with the Lords the spies the few years if there's little Scruples in our neighborhood Entre Las personas amongst the people Iglesia amongst the church or wherever it is that has nothing to do with us we shall not the file our garments with the things of the world for you shall come and someday in a moment that sudden secret Rapture of your church you'll be coming over the hill of time down the horizontal rainbow to take away the church you can have both portions because that's only for a small amount of time let us pray Heavenly Father Lord we give you thanks for those rainbows Lord is help us Lord to not reject your Covenant do not reject your grace as we advance more and more we're going to that open portion that's available to the whole world we're going to that sealed portion that is only for your selected bride that those bitterness Lord may not unmotivate us [Music] but it may help us as a sign that there's a Grace that God wants to give us the second grace of rapture [Music] [Music] in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen [Music] thank you I sing praises to your name oh Lord praises to your name [Music] for your name is [Music] foreign [Music]
