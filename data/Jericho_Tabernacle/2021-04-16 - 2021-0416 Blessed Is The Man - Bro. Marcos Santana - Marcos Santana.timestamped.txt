[23:17] [Music]
[23:20] it's an honor honor and privilege to be
[23:22] here once again
[23:27] and i want to thank the local ministry
[23:29] for the opportunity to be here before
[23:30] you all speaking once more
[23:34] ministries
[23:38] it's always a privilege
[23:41] even though uh very nervous all the time
[23:47] but we want to let god take control this
[23:49] evening
[23:53] i decided to speak in english tonight
[23:57] in english because this is a youth
[24:00] service
[24:02] and so i felt as though the majority of
[24:04] our young people they speak english as
[24:06] their first language
[24:12] knowing some of our young people spanish
[24:14] is their first language
[24:19] but we're going to try and do our best
[24:21] this evening
[24:25] before entering in a word of prayer if
[24:27] you can open your bibles to psalms
[24:29] chapter one anthony
[24:38] [Music]
[24:44] foreign
[24:47] [Music]
[24:48] psalms one salmon verse one reads
[24:54] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[24:56] the counsel of the ungodly
[24:58] nor standeth in the way of sinners nor
[25:01] sitteth
[25:01] in the sea of the scornful aventura
[25:06] de marlos
[25:12] our heads for a word of prayer
[25:17] lord heavenly father we come before you
[25:19] this evening
[25:24] giving you all the honor and glory that
[25:26] you deserve father
[25:29] glory lord asking that you be with us
[25:33] this evening
[25:37] may you bless this reading of your word
[25:41] that you bless each and every one of the
[25:42] young people here in attendance
[25:47] every single young person watching via
[25:49] the internet
[25:52] and every young person that might watch
[25:54] this in the future
[26:05] [Music]
[26:16] [Music]
[26:31] glory in the name of the lord jesus
[26:33] christ
[26:36] amen amen you may be seated
[26:43] i never thought i'd feel a little
[26:45] awkward speaking in english before
[26:53] i grew up a little ashamed of speaking
[26:55] spanish
[27:00] but now i think i've grown a little fond
[27:02] of the language
[27:06] let us read that scripture one more time
[27:11] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[27:13] the counsel of the ungodly
[27:18] nor standeth in the way of the sinners
[27:22] nor siddith in the sea of the scornful
[27:26] de escarnes now this scripture here
[27:31] i heard brother luis vaguely mention it
[27:34] in one of his sermons
[27:41] and he tied it to how it is uh the
[27:43] testimony of a young person that's never
[27:46] stepped out into the world
[27:51] and and i thought i was the only one
[27:53] that saw this scripture in that manner
[27:58] it gave me peace in my heart to know
[28:00] that someone else thinks the same way
[28:07] because in english as i read it
[28:11] i see clearly here that it's speaking
[28:12] about a man or a woman
[28:26] they're not letting themselves be
[28:27] influenced by the counsel of those
[28:29] worldly people
[28:34] they're not standing in those places
[28:35] where the sinful congregate
[28:40] and the most beautiful part about it to
[28:42] me
[28:54] [Music]
[28:56] you
[28:57] [Music]
[29:05] if you can remain and preserve that
[29:08] purity about yourselves
[29:27] because there was a go there was a
[29:28] purpose and a mission that he had to
[29:29] carry about
[29:34] and brother branham's not more special
[29:36] than any one of you young people tonight
[29:38] yeah le mans
[29:51] and why not identify yourself with this
[29:53] scripture tonight
[29:57] and be blessed in knowing that you have
[29:59] kept yourself from those evil things
[30:05] a few days ago we uh we assisted uh
[30:08] at a a church here in phoenix
[30:14] in phoenix uh there's a there's a
[30:15] brother that's well known his name is
[30:17] brother
[30:17] kaidry diggs uh
[30:28] but a brother that god truly uses in a
[30:30] tremendous way
[30:35] for a long time his messages have been
[30:37] played in my home
[30:38] por mucho tiempo los mensages
[30:41] and we had the opportunity to see him so
[30:43] we took advantage of that
[30:48] we were all blessed but there's one
[30:51] thing that stood out to me more than
[30:52] anything that he said
[30:56] now young people might seem a little
[30:58] simple
[31:02] but just take this for yourself today
[31:07] brother dick said the greatest act of
[31:10] faith
[31:14] now the greatest act of faith
[31:19] [Music]
[31:30] he says the greatest act of faith
[31:34] is to just accept the word that's been
[31:36] given to you
[31:40] that's simple i see listen to you that's
[31:42] simple i see this and see you
[31:44] if the word
[31:58] and that's the greatest act of faith
[32:03] to simply accept the word of god
[32:08] so young people today if i could use
[32:12] that as a bit of a foundation to get you
[32:13] ready
[32:15] fundamental just keep that in your heart
[32:20] if there's a word that's spoken to you
[32:25] that is speaking to you que te then just
[32:28] know that the greatest act of your faith
[32:34] is if you can just accept it
[32:39] so keep that tonight because what it is
[32:41] do that tonight
[32:43] whatever it is that you're asking of god
[32:44] tonight young person
[32:48] and not just young person anybody
[32:52] god can grant it for you i want to read
[32:56] as a foundation quote from the message
[32:58] be certain of god
[33:04] in 1959 brother branham says after this
[33:08] stern hardcut
[33:09] message
[33:13] rude and brought out in this rough way
[33:18] but it's the truth brother brandon was
[33:21] referring to the message he just
[33:22] preached
[33:26] and he was about to enter into his
[33:27] closing prayers
[33:31] he says if you humbly believe what
[33:34] you've asked for
[33:36] um
[33:50] so young person write that down in your
[33:52] heart
[33:55] the greatest act of faith that i can
[33:57] have
[34:00] is just accept the word given to you
[34:04] and write down yes kriva that don't you
[34:07] never let nothing push you away from
[34:09] that straight rope
[34:14] just stand right there
[34:17] but branham continues
[34:32] until you accept it as your own personal
[34:35] properties
[34:39] do we understand that young people i
[34:42] don't care how much i jump and shout
[34:44] here
[34:44] no important
[34:58] unless you can accept it as your own
[35:00] personal property
[35:12] and i'm sure he probably shared this in
[35:14] his wisdom with many men
[35:18] but my father shared it to me when i was
[35:19] a young boy
[35:22] and i used to laugh about this
[35:25] and brother bernie would tell them you
[35:28] know i just
[35:42] if that's god and the way he's working
[35:44] on that day
[35:47] in particular then let god's will be
[35:49] done
[35:51] but now brother is just making a
[35:53] commentary
[35:56] i don't get it these men jumping and
[35:58] screaming in prolonged services
[36:03] he says if the word of god don't bring
[36:05] the center to the altar this is
[36:10] what do they think that all these extras
[36:12] are going to do
[36:16] and then he asked the question almost
[36:17] sarcastically
[36:21] well are we capable of doing god a favor
[36:24] capacity
[36:38] maybe raise their hand like that
[36:41] maybe just nod their head like this
[36:44] the word of god has done no effect in
[36:46] them
[36:48] but if i start shouting and shouting
[36:52] preaching
[37:13] then the word will do its job
[37:48] you've been
[37:56] then be baptized in the name of jesus
[37:58] christ for the remission of your sins
[38:16] it must be that way so if you're a
[38:19] backslider tonight
[38:22] i don't know who you are but you should
[38:25] know who you are
[38:27] god can take you back tonight
[38:58] we
[39:20] i know you all know the pattern of
[39:21] receiving the holy ghost
[39:27] i'm sure every minister up here has
[39:29] preached that over and over again
[39:35] so if you know it you'll agree with what
[39:36] i'm about to say
[39:40] is
[40:03] so i just wanted to share with you young
[40:04] people this evening
[40:08] my personal process towards the new
[40:10] birth me propio
[40:12] proceso personal para el nacimiento uh
[40:15] i'm not here to share my testimony i've
[40:16] shared that plenty of times
[40:21] but i i but the process of how i knew i
[40:24] received my new birth
[40:26] process
[40:30] i was 19 years old drunk one night
[40:35] i was out in some bar underage drinking
[40:40] and then one night the place got raided
[40:41] by the police
[40:46] because they knew some illegal activity
[40:47] was taking place in there
[40:52] [Music]
[41:02] i was going in and out of consciousness
[41:03] from being so drunk that
[41:17] and i told him drop me off in my dad's
[41:19] house
[41:22] but at that time i no longer lived in my
[41:24] parents house
[41:27] so it was already weird that i wanted to
[41:28] be there
[41:31] but during that car ride for those 45
[41:34] minutes
[41:37] something clicked in my brain and i
[41:39] realized
[41:42] and i noticed at any given moment in my
[41:44] life at that point
[41:58] simple death from just getting sick
[41:59] nothing crazy
[42:04] for any reason if i died at that stage
[42:07] in my life
[42:11] i hadn't even fulfilled the first step
[42:14] is
[42:30] and i could only imagine i was sitting
[42:32] there holding on to him asking him i
[42:34] need to get baptized i need to get
[42:35] baptized
[42:42] and he told me okay son let's let's wait
[42:43] in the morning let's talk about it
[42:44] tomorrow
[42:49] because he didn't know is this the drunk
[42:51] man talking or is this actually him
[42:52] talking
[42:56] about
[42:58] so then in the morning that's all that
[42:59] was in my heart i wanted to get baptized
[43:06] i knew that i had to obtain my salvation
[43:08] somehow someway
[43:10] jose
[43:36] [Music]
[43:54] but after all that happiness took place
[43:55] inside of me yeah
[43:59] then satan started to torture me and
[44:01] torture me
[44:04] getting inside of my head
[44:08] [Music]
[44:47] and i remember just fighting within
[44:48] myself this is something i need to do
[44:54] and young people these are moments in
[44:57] your life that you'll never forget
[45:01] you know in your christian walk there's
[45:02] certain certain uh
[45:04] milestones that you go through
[45:10] the minister that spoke the day you gave
[45:12] your heart to the lord
[45:17] like sister brianna spoke the other day
[45:21] the minister that came to the house for
[45:23] a month straight and she received her
[45:24] new birth through his ministry
[45:31] the brother that baptized you when you
[45:32] give your heart to god
[45:37] moments in your life that nobody can
[45:39] ever take from you momentos
[45:43] and i'll never forget brother sir suarez
[45:45] baptize me in san marcos
[45:48] suarez in san marcos there brother jimmy
[45:51] garcia's church
[45:53] garcia just so precious to me in my
[45:54] heart
[45:57] but now the point of all this testimony
[45:59] that i'm sharing with the young people
[46:05] is that god has a traditional pattern
[46:09] [Music]
[46:11] or a perfect pattern patron perfecto
[46:14] like we said earlier
[46:16] to be repent to repent be baptized
[46:20] receive the holy spirit be justified
[46:26] to
[46:40] we got this country old prophet that
[46:42] made it so simple for us to understand
[46:49] that he gave us that simple analogy of a
[46:51] pregnancy
[46:54] that
[47:04] and then you have the physical birth of
[47:06] that baby
[47:23] those steps into three stages of my life
[47:30] at the age of 19 like i said i was
[47:32] baptized
[47:35] i got justified who's
[48:05] justificado de estabida i started
[48:07] accumulating a new set of sins in my
[48:09] life
[48:12] so i walked for three years in
[48:13] justification
[48:17] and at the age of 22 from 19 to 22.
[48:23] i met my girlfriend my wife
[48:26] and as you've heard her testimony she
[48:28] had her experience in one day
[48:30] come on very different than that of the
[48:35] traditional experience
[48:40] we believe with all our hearts she was
[48:41] justified sanctify to fill with the holy
[48:43] ghost in one instance
[48:46] justification
[48:53] god wanted to take me down the
[48:54] traditional perfect pattern he has in
[48:56] his scriptures
[49:21] i started going to church three times a
[49:23] week
[49:25] i cleaned my filthy mouth
[49:40] that was the bait that he chose to use
[49:42] to take me through that sanctification
[49:48] so for three months i was in a stage of
[49:50] sanctification
[49:54] from august to november
[50:10] in a simple
[50:29] he said you know the apostles it took
[50:30] them almost four years to get their holy
[50:32] ghost experience
[50:38] so young people there's no need to get
[50:40] discouraged tonight
[50:44] you've already been baptized you're
[50:46] coming here to church
[50:48] you're living the best that you can you
[50:51] might not know what stage that you're in
[50:52] he says
[51:02] the apostles in this bible it took them
[51:03] almost four years
[51:07] so i'm sorry but i'm going to say it
[51:08] like this
[51:10] then what are we complaining about the
[51:13] promise is already in his scriptures
[51:17] i didn't know it at the time i didn't
[51:20] know what stage i was in
[51:22] i didn't understand what god was doing
[51:24] in my personal life
[51:27] but now i can look in retrospect
[51:31] and i put the pieces of the puzzle
[51:34] together
[52:01] then he's been with you this whole time
[52:05] you've been presented and dedicated to
[52:07] the lord
[52:09] so there's been that angel that's been
[52:10] walking with you every step of the way
[52:16] is
[52:30] manifest that greatest gift of faith
[52:35] then just accept the word being speaking
[52:38] to you
[52:41] so once more speaking about that pattern
[52:44] is
[53:09] you don't have to pass through those
[53:10] same things
[53:27] and god's got a perfect pattern set out
[53:29] just for you
[53:33] i love how brother louis said in one of
[53:35] his messages
[53:39] he made that example about the sign you
[53:49] and then you see that sign five miles to
[53:51] phoenix
[53:55] you don't start praising and worshiping
[53:57] and getting all excited
[54:01] no you're not in phoenix
[54:04] you got five more miles to go
[54:07] you see that sign on the road el camino
[54:10] on your christian walk into camino
[54:12] cristiano on that long
[54:14] journey and it says
[54:17] five miles to the new birth
[54:21] don't stop
[54:36] no time
[54:45] i don't care young people whatever stage
[54:47] that you're in
[54:50] you're in justification
[55:18] i want to be that raptured bride of the
[55:20] lord jesus christ
[55:23] don't go down no dead end streets
[55:27] don't make no u-turns in your walk
[55:32] don't let satan disrupt your mind with
[55:33] none of those foolish things
[55:39] i just want to encourage you young
[55:40] people a little bit solamente
[55:43] i don't know maybe this evening you're
[55:45] thinking inside your mind
[55:54] maybe the little faith that i do i think
[55:56] it's been getting weak
[56:00] i think i'm losing that faith
[56:04] this walk is getting harder and harder
[56:05] for me
[56:08] i don't know what's going on with that
[56:09] faith that i thought i had no no
[56:13] don't get discouraged young people
[56:17] you haven't lost your faith your faith
[56:19] ain't weak
[56:20] suffer your faith has you here tonight
[56:25] your faith led you to repentance
[56:28] your faith
[56:43] brother kidri also shared a testimony
[56:45] that night el mono
[56:48] testimonial that stuck to me like glue
[56:51] okay
[56:52] and uh i'm sure many of you probably
[56:54] know that testimony from brother branham
[57:04] and and how brother branham was on that
[57:06] plane on his way to the west coast
[57:11] and he had to have an emergency landing
[57:12] in the city of memphis
[57:17] and brother branham says that they had
[57:18] to land there and he was placed in the
[57:20] peabody hotel
[57:24] foreign in the morning he said well i'm
[57:26] going to take advantage of my time and
[57:28] go mail some letters
[57:33] for correspondence
[57:36] but the holy ghost tells him to turn
[57:38] around
[57:54] that there was an elijah that was going
[57:56] to come across the way
[57:58] okay just like the shumanite woman that
[58:02] was waiting on her elijah
[58:06] elias because she needed the healing of
[58:08] her son
[58:10] and now what what stood out to me
[58:14] is that brother diggs he testifies
[58:18] that there were some brothers i'm
[58:20] assuming they were from that area
[58:25] they got the curiosity
[58:28] i wonder how long brother branham walked
[58:30] that day
[58:34] i don't know if any adult or any young
[58:36] person ever thought about that
[58:40] but as the story goes
[58:44] he left the hotel hotel and he walked
[58:47] over all the way to this bridge
[58:48] camino and he crossed that bridge and
[58:51] then made it to auntie's house with the
[58:53] with the fence in front
[58:59] so if i ask the young people tonight
[59:15] you can give any guess you want in your
[59:17] mind
[59:20] maybe ten blocks he says maybe walk for
[59:22] an hour he says
[59:24] maybe he walked for a mile two miles he
[59:26] says
[59:28] but these brothers testify that they
[59:29] went to the peabody hotel
[59:44] and then from
[59:57] brother diggs was expanding upon this
[1:00:01] exponent it blew me away because that's
[1:00:04] that's a long
[1:00:05] hard walk
[1:00:09] brother diggs was saying all brother
[1:00:11] branham had this
[1:00:22] and as he kept walking his plane was
[1:00:24] going to leave and it said keep walking
[1:00:30] and as the neighborhood got more rough
[1:00:31] and rough the voice said keep on walking
[1:00:38] there was no vision there was no
[1:00:45] it was just a simple voice that said
[1:00:47] keep on walking
[1:00:51] so maybe you've been baptized in january
[1:01:09] but i i dare to say any of the young
[1:01:11] people here today
[1:01:16] i don't think you had a vision that told
[1:01:18] you when you were going to get the new
[1:01:19] birth
[1:01:24] i dare to say i don't think you had a
[1:01:25] dream that told you where you were going
[1:01:27] to receive the new births
[1:01:33] but i know for sure that you young
[1:01:35] people heard the voice that you would
[1:01:37] receive that new birth
[1:01:43] because i heard that voice i've been
[1:01:46] here for all the baptisms since i moved
[1:01:48] to phoenix
[1:01:52] and i heard the voice every last one of
[1:01:56] these brothers that have baptized you
[1:01:57] young people
[1:02:01] i didn't hear a voice of man i heard the
[1:02:19] it said be baptized in the name of the
[1:02:21] lord jesus christ
[1:02:24] and you were baptized in the name of the
[1:02:26] lord jesus christ
[1:02:29] that voice said you shall receive the
[1:02:33] gift
[1:02:34] of the holy ghost
[1:02:38] there was no prophecy no via prophet
[1:02:40] there was no dreams
[1:02:41] but brother followed just a voice
[1:02:46] he walked on faith from that voice
[1:02:50] when you got into those waters you heard
[1:02:52] that voice
[1:02:56] so don't be discouraged because it was
[1:03:00] three years it was five years
[1:03:03] was four years but for you young person
[1:03:07] today it could be your year
[1:03:09] bro
[1:03:12] i was baptized in 19. yo me bautista
[1:03:29] you know i don't know if you can really
[1:03:31] get into the scene of what brother
[1:03:33] branham went through
[1:03:38] if i could dramatize it for you young
[1:03:39] people tonight
[1:03:43] imagine yourself somewhere at a nice
[1:03:44] fancy hotel in scottsdale
[1:03:50] and then the voice of god tells you to
[1:03:51] just start walking
[1:03:55] and you're walking all the way down to
[1:03:57] tempe in college town
[1:03:58] illogo caminando por tempe college town
[1:04:01] and you're looking at your watch saying
[1:04:02] lord what are you trying to do with me
[1:04:06] you keep on walking now you've made your
[1:04:09] way into the city of phoenix
[1:04:13] you're wondering lord what what do you
[1:04:14] want from me
[1:04:17] and then you make your way all the way
[1:04:19] to the south side
[1:04:22] and i'm just now starting to learn about
[1:04:24] the south side
[1:04:28] i hear gunshots by my house
[1:04:32] i see the police officers up and down my
[1:04:34] block
[1:04:37] and i see all the druggies and why not
[1:04:39] at the corner stores
[1:04:44] but god's telling you keep on walking
[1:04:48] now that's faith you don't have no
[1:04:51] vision nothing is vision you don't have
[1:04:52] no signs
[1:05:06] with your faith that you've got you said
[1:05:09] you can have the new birth this evening

[1:06:31] holy ghost since you believe
[1:06:36] you believed chris but have you received
[1:06:38] the holy ghost since you believed
[1:06:43] every one of you young people ask

[1:07:25] up

[1:11:46] raised in a christian home
[1:11:50] that lifestyle that they have to live
[1:12:06] that was
[1:12:16] they have to deal with the scars and the
[1:12:18] memories that they went through
[1:12:33] you know he said it's so sad brother
[1:12:34] marcos
[1:12:37] these youth they don't need to step out
[1:12:41] you know if they step out they won't be
[1:12:42] able to erase those memories of sin
[1:12:48] you know once you gamble and you see how
[1:12:51] you could turn uh one dollar into a
[1:12:53] thousand dollars
[1:12:56] you will never see money the same
[1:12:58] caberas
[1:13:00] because you know what it can do you know
[1:13:03] you start taking
[1:13:04] those extra shifts at work

[1:13:30] you can't go to the grocery store the
[1:13:31] same no more yeah
[1:13:34] you can't go to the restaurant the same
[1:13:36] no more yeah

[1:13:58] driving your car
[1:14:12] i can spot out as a
[1:14:17] cigar of marijuana from miles away
[1:14:24] and that smell comes instantly to my
[1:14:26] nostrils
[1:14:40] if you ever go past that simple
[1:14:42] handshake
[1:14:45] between a young brother to a sister a
[1:14:47] young sister to a brother
[1:14:51] and you experiment with satan's oldest
[1:14:54] trick in the book
[1:15:03] you will never see a man or a woman the
[1:15:06] same in your life
[1:15:32] that you've got to deal with in these
[1:15:33] memories that you can't erase
[1:15:51] it's known birth your spirit will be
[1:15:53] free so espiritu
[1:15:55] because it's no longer your spirit it's
[1:15:57] the holy spirit in you
[1:16:00] but that flesh is gonna fight every
[1:16:02] single day
[1:16:18] but we don't get a body change down here
[1:16:23] but with that holy spirit that you can
[1:16:25] get tonight
[1:16:29] you can overcome and defeat that flesh
[1:16:31] that you walk with every day just
[1:17:13] [Music]

[1:18:58] tell you i can do it all on my own
[1:19:04] but i'm a sinner i'm
[1:19:27] because the lord jesus christ did it for
[1:19:29] me
[1:19:32] that day when he died on calvary
