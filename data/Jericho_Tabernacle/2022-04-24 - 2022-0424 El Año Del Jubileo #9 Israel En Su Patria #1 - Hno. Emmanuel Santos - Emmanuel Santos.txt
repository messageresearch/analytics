saves your soul and gives them eternal life help these people or ministers [Music] the third chapter [Music] the word says and to the angel of the church in philadelphia right these things sayeth he that is holy he that is true he that have the key of david he that openeth and no man shut it and shut it and no man openeth i know thy works behold i set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou has little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is the new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and i will write upon him my new name amen you may take your seats blessed reading of his word um it says i will write upon him the name of my god in the name of my of the city of my god which is the new jerusalem final and at the very end it says i will write upon him my new name so the first name that he mentions is the name of my god and it's only one name that we have now the name of jesus christ that's the name of god today but we know that even brother brahms says it's god who's going to decide so this morning i'd like to enter into a new phase of the year of jubilee is israel it's israel in their homeland we have a homeland which is this earth this is where we're going to live for all eternity now obviously because of the falling of adam and eve the world fell down to a perversion even nature itself fell down to a perversion and our bodies enter a perversion because our bodies were made out of the dust of this earth that's something that you like christ himself came to fulfill vamos a leviticus let's go to leviticus uh the 25th chapter verse 9. the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month and the day of the atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your lands is and you shall hallow the 50th year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land of all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man onto his possession and you shall return every man on to his family a jubilee shall there that 50th year be unto you you shall not sow neither reap with that which groweth of itself in it nor gather the grapes in it of the vine un undressed for as a jubilee it shall be holy unto you you shall eat the increased thereof out of the field says the breach between the seven church ages and the seven seals but the law required a kinsmen redeemer the law of god required a kinsmen redeemer you it's also connected with our redemption christo in la cruz christ in the cross share his blood cincuenta vias despues 50 days before he resurrected after he resurrected it's your jubilee even though we might not you remember that he wanted to give all the kingdoms to jesus without paying the price legally to obtain those kingdoms now christ could have received those kingdoms if he would accept what satan was offering him without pain but he paid because he does things the right way sustains genesis now if you go to genesis if you read the saints of the old testament like adam abraham abram uh sarah sarah etc etc because they're preparing for their death they want to go to abram paid aquidis in the future do you see how say they hear the scriptures para recibirlo tried to try to make him break god's plan to receive it gave it to him he took him up on the mountain and try to give it to him without the purchase of the blood como connecto esto le mano but notice how brother ram connects it you notice abraham when you try to give him the land hello with so many shackles of silver antel pueblo before the people as an ensign common testimonial as a witness let it be known that this day i bought this bearing place see he purchased it and said to try to give him the kingdom which belongs to him diablo he didn't receive the free offer of the devil he knew that he had to pay for legal to have the legal right upon that land even the bible is a prophetic book and it requires a prophet to get the pieces together matthew 16 27 says the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with eight with his angels and then he shall reward every man according to his works i say unto you there be some standing here which are not taste of death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom oh now that's the last verse in the next chapter uno verse 1. jesus pedro a jacob juan sermano after six days jesus taketh peter james and john his brother and bringeth them up onto a high mountain part is it was transfigured before him and his face did shine as the sun and his raymond was white as the light i want you to remember that portion that his face and behold there appeared unto moses and elias talking with him then answered peter said unto jesus lord it is good for us to be here if thou wilt let us make here three tabernacles one for thee one for moses and one for elias de luz behold a bright cloud overshadowed him and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son son who i will please hear ye him says it they fell on their face and they were sore afraid of teaches us that this was the adoption of jesus the laws of the old testament when a jew a jewish father was going to adopt his son he would do a ceremony for him he said put him in a high place we'll give them a new garments this was the adoption of jesus because the sun was like the sun and his garment was bright as the light este is me just says this is my beloved son hear ye him in other words what he says that has to be done then he saw the coming or the rehearsal in mattel this is how in matthew 16 jesus jesus tells his disciples there's going to be people that are not going to die peter james and john vieron une they saw a rehearsal that's the key let us continue the first thing he saw lo primero que vio en la vinida fue amo the first thing he saw in the coming was moses represent the dead saints that would be resurrected that's all the six ages that they slept six church ages but elijah was there el mensahiro de lutimo the messenger of the last day with his all that gathered with him pedro jacobo juan fue completa what was it his promise to peter james john was fulfilled correct that's right because he said some standing here will not taste of death until they see the son of man coming in his kingdom and they seen the rehearsal of it the divine revelation of the word adoption number two now he did the same thing to his son jesus when he took jesus up on mount transfiguration he took peter james and john up there that's three witnesses of the earth in la montagna there was jesus moses and elijah and god up on the mountain remember when a son is adopted a ceremony a ceremony a ceremony is being done and when they look they see jesus being glorified before them is that right what did he do he dressed him on the robe of immortality he said he and he said he is raymond shine like the sun porque jesus because jesus was adopted there was a ceremony there was witnesses and he was dressed with a new body the echo dc branham in fact brother bram says that was the body he had after the resurrection then jesus also there the transfiguration in the transfiguration he was on the on the top part said his face shine like the sun now notice all this revelation that god gives us there are rehearsals that allows us to see literally things that are literally going to happen in the future now the age of the open door una one of those manifestations are the revelations of jesus christ and the same revelation that you received today islamism having the same revelations and the same rehearsals and why is that because you're going to marry jesus christ there's going to be a wedding and for a wedding he was the capstone here speaking about the new city where we're going to la noire the new jerusalem necessity and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of god delight lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof so for a light illuminati can illuminate a great space come on like these lights that we have but this one doesn't have anything the bible said and there was no temple there but the lord god and the lamb is the temple of it el cordero es la lumbrera the lamb is the lion el cordero es el temple the lamb is the temple el cordero es el no the lamb is the throne el cordero es la vida the lamb is the life el es ese to worship the lord jesus christ because the one who we're worshiping is already there jesus christ will be there like peter and john up on top of the mountains the light covered the top of the mountain said and a voice spoken said this is but with god we're doing a rehearsal of what we're going to do there in the future that's why we have the message the message helps us to do our rehearsal of a wedding rehearsal now let's after and jesus what is it to you if he remains to my coming and the bible says that a new doctrine began the pultado being buried in san juan bentuno bente and saint john 21 20. some critics started this in the early days right while we're hearing this lesson let's clean it up in san juan bente ventino in st john 2021 jesus jesus had met with his disciples fed him fish and bread upon fire they said that jesus said that he was going to live until the coming but jesus did not make no mistake notice what brother bram says right here in revelations the fourth chapter christ kept his word el trajo juan alcielo he brought john up onto heaven and rehearsed the whole thing gloria el bio la vista anticipated glory he saw the preview he saw it just as though he lived on the earth as he saw the whole the whole thing the whole church ages and the and the whole book of revelation where john saw and he wrote in apocalypses and revelations it was the fulfillment of his promises of what he said in st john 21. to you if he waits until i come pablos but he first saw the rehearsal video [Applause] just just like john pedro jacob juan and peter james and john just you have the rehearsals what you're going to do in the future why because there's a wedding will and took him and showed him the whole thing before he even died just like he lived the whole thing through le monstrolo right here on the fourth chapter the second verse proves it just as though as he lived right down through the whole thing and he saw it all happened he just took him up there and showed him la pelicula the film that he was turning el cuerpo de crisis the entire body of christ this is called juan for raptago so when john was raptured and he saw the rehearsal represent it represented you represent represents what you do through the revelations of jesus christ when he spoke to him an apocalypse cuatro on revelations chapter four oh you know i heard a voice as of a trumpet that's the voice of the rapture us you can rehearse that and he transfiguration one has already experimented the voice of an archangel which was moses which is the voice of the resurrection experiment there was another one who uh experienced the trumpet which was elijah that he was raptured that voice it's a voice that's also going to call us is it's not that he decided that he was going to condemn los angeles that he didn't even know when the great earthquake was going to happen but at towards the end of the tape he was uh inspired to say what he said and it was the voice of archangel because it's the voice of judgment that produces fear the fear of god that's how the ladies are crying in that tape porque los angeles why did it happen in los angeles because in los angeles oneself and his judgments for others for those who reject me now i just want to read the quote first for brother branham speak about jesus rebuking the priest and they put him out of their camp jesus jesus suffered without the camp in other words he was taken outside of jerusalem and they put them out outside the camp way beyond their camp that was a crucifixion there more than 2 000 years ago and observe how the prophet gathers it together on the next paragraph we find out the bible said in the last day under the loudest in age excuse me in the last day under the latter c and age they would do the same thing they would be put out of the camp our observation jesus more than 2000 years ago he was taken out of the city of jerusalem with the other ages or also esta afuera de la di it's out of laura jesus crucification like jesus outside of jerusalem when they crucified it was once again crucified where for jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffer without the gate now notice what paul tells us what to do let us go forth therefore onto him and where is jesus he's without he's outside fuera del campamento without the camp bearing his reproach for we have no continuing city no buscamos la por venir but we seek one to come that's why there is an age that exists as the closed door because it's laura they cast them out hilo crucification and they crucified him again the prophet even says it is that he accused this generation crucifixion for the second crucifix crucifix crucifixion of jesus christ because they were crucifying the words they were rejecting the word and they cast them out of the city they cast them out of la racea him in the air rehearsals because there's a wedding we require a wedding rehearsal jesus is perfect because god is perfect everything he does in absolutely particular it's a very particular voice the voice of archangel trumpetta voice of trumpet voice of thunder it is also a voice of a lion when jesus used that voice de leon the voice of a lion why is it a voice of a lion in the natural leon a lion when he roars heaven saying i have been both glorified and i will glorify it again and the people that were there avid that stood by and heard it and said that thundered others said an angel spake to him it was a voice some thought it was a is for the person that's on their side doesn't feel nothing even though we're all here god can speak only to one person is it's the voice of thunder it was the voice of archangel it's a very strong voice but it has to cross the mention it's a voice it says that jesus christ and a loud voice in that voice have the capacity to take him out of that dimension and to bring him back to this [Applause] dimension now this voice also has the capacity that's in the here in this dimension and take you to that dimension just like the prophet being raptured he said he roared and he was raptured has the capacity to break seals and many of the out of the tomb now i want to read this quote here on the the true easter seal because he broke the seal off of it he broke the seal of death he broke the seal of the tomb el rompio del infield he broke the seal of hell el rompio el del cepulco he brought the seal of the graveyard as we know the message is is this the sign of the answer is this was the year 62. in the year 63. that's when the cloud appeared but first he had a rehearsal he had make you get this right and then he says first there was a blast and i thought it sounded like a sound barrier or we call it when the planes cross that sound and the sound comes back to the earth it shook everything it roared todo everything um i just heard that that great blast when it came forth and it sound like it came from the south for me towards mexico but it shook the earth and when it did it looked like it might have been little dots there could have been no less than five and not more than seven perov they were coming in the shape of a pyramid like these messengers the voices is islamism the same voice with different effects personas because there's different people in different positions spiritualities different spiritual positions but they hear the same voice yes in a dimension and it brings it to your dimension you're here in this dimension and take you to that dimension the book of redemption that has seven seals now hear this verse is and i saw in the right hand of him that sounded thrown a book written within and on the back side sealed with seven seals let's go to the next chapter apocalypse revelation and that's how the lamb opened one of the seals one of his guards and it says one of the one of the four beasts saying you go to the message the first guard que ba al primer sayo the ghost of the first seal it's the lion in apocalypse yes revelations 10. verse one [Music] and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was at word of the sun and his feet as pillars of fire remember when jesus went during the transfiguration a sun shine like the sun este ankel aqui this angel here wrapped in a cloud in his face where's the sun it's christ a cry with a loud voice as when a lion roareth islamism it's the same voice and the way he reveals itself today it all depends on our attitude and that's going to determine if that voice is going to give us rapturing faith what's going to cause us to be in the great tribulation it all depends on our attitude if you accept christ now you can have rehearsals rehearsals rehearsals but to others the great tribulation pertains to them lord help us to have the right spirit election correcta and the correct attitude comenzano beginning with myself mr manas with my brothers and sisters help us to be more humble in jesus christ amen amen [Applause]
