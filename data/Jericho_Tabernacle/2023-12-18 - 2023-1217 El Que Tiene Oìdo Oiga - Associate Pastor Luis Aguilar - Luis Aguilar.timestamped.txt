[1:21:46] locally we're in the same battle we're
[1:21:48] in the same
[1:21:51] fight
[1:21:55] be so kind open your Bibles in the Book
[1:21:57] of Luke
[1:22:00] 8 verse
[1:22:02] [Music]
[1:22:08] eight this morning we want to start some
[1:22:15] messages and we want to call it he that
[1:22:18] have an ear let him
[1:22:21] hear a few weeks ago like a month
[1:22:25] ago I was
[1:22:28] studying and the word hear came to
[1:22:36] mind and I began to study to put the
[1:22:39] pieces of the puzzle
[1:22:42] together and I just you know put it away
[1:22:45] and I seemed to forgot
[1:22:50] it and as time went on on that thought
[1:22:53] began to bother me
[1:23:02] again uh and then one day I I played the
[1:23:05] tape the spoken word is the Original
[1:23:13] Seed not because of the title itself but
[1:23:16] because of the length of the
[1:23:18] message I played it so it just can keep
[1:23:21] on playing
[1:23:24] uh I left and I started to do some
[1:23:26] things that I had to
[1:23:28] do and once I came back I sat
[1:23:33] down and the prophet was reading this
[1:23:37] scripture and he said how I would love
[1:23:39] to preach about
[1:23:41] this and I said Lord you're truly
[1:23:44] tremendous you're so
[1:23:47] perfect I play the tape I
[1:23:51] leave
[1:23:53] and I come at the exact time when your
[1:23:54] Prophet says
[1:23:56] [Music]
[1:23:57] this before we read the Bible we're
[1:24:00] going to
[1:24:01] pray our Lord Heavenly
[1:24:05] Father this morning we're completely
[1:24:08] trusting on
[1:24:13] you trusting that you are the same
[1:24:15] yesterday today and
[1:24:17] forever and your people's here
[1:24:19] [Music]
[1:24:20] Lord wanting to hear your word
[1:24:23] word now father I ask that you cleanse
[1:24:26] our
[1:24:28] hearts when the word is
[1:24:32] spoken May the seed go into the heart of
[1:24:36] the
[1:24:40] individual we ask that Lord you help us
[1:24:42] to bring out this message in the way
[1:24:44] that you gave it to
[1:24:45] us open our
[1:24:47] eyes open our
[1:24:50] ears we ask for all this in the name of
[1:24:53] the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:24:56] amen Luke
[1:24:58] [Music]
[1:25:12] 88 and other fell on good ground and
[1:25:15] sprang up and bear fruits and
[1:25:18] hundredfold and when he had said these
[1:25:20] things he cried he that hath ears to
[1:25:22] hear Let Him hear
[1:25:25] am you may be
[1:25:27] [Music]
[1:25:30] seated we thank the song Lead and the
[1:25:35] musicians he that have an ear let him
[1:25:39] hear for those that study their
[1:25:42] [Applause]
[1:25:44] Bible maybe you've uh come across that
[1:25:49] phrase but if you uh read your Bible
[1:25:55] about 15 times you'll come across that
[1:25:57] certain phrase in the
[1:26:00] Bible and it's always the same uh person
[1:26:03] that says the same
[1:26:05] phrase It's the Lord Jesus
[1:26:10] Christ and he always says that phrase he
[1:26:12] that have an ear let him
[1:26:17] hear now here the messenger says in the
[1:26:19] message perfect
[1:26:21] faith he says he that has an
[1:26:25] ear let him hear what the spirit saith
[1:26:28] to the
[1:26:32] churches he says you know in the Bible
[1:26:35] it's always constantly saying
[1:26:37] that to him that has
[1:26:40] Faith to him that has an ear let him to
[1:26:47] hear Let Him hear see he that have
[1:26:49] wisdom let him count the numbers of the
[1:26:51] Beast
[1:26:53] all these different
[1:26:57] things he that has let him tell it to
[1:27:00] the rest of them that they might
[1:27:03] have so if you just look at the
[1:27:06] words it says he that
[1:27:10] have in the Book of
[1:27:14] Revelation it says to he that
[1:27:18] overcometh now brother vom says it's he
[1:27:21] doesn't say that it's the church that
[1:27:25] overcomes but he say it's the individual
[1:27:28] that
[1:27:30] overcomes so he says he that hath an
[1:27:35] ear let him hear what the spirit saith
[1:27:38] unto the
[1:27:39] churches so in other words the Holy
[1:27:41] Ghost is speaking to the
[1:27:44] church but within the
[1:27:48] church there's only few that have that
[1:27:51] ear
[1:27:54] uh if you notice it's the
[1:27:58] individual every age has had its own
[1:28:02] elect and that group of
[1:28:05] elect always listened to the
[1:28:08] word and received the
[1:28:12] word showing that they have God's seed
[1:28:15] within
[1:28:17] them there's not one Church
[1:28:21] age
[1:28:22] where this verse isn't
[1:28:27] mentioned each age has the same
[1:28:31] warning for the people of all the
[1:28:36] ages now the messenger says this and
[1:28:38] it's very tremendous when he says
[1:28:41] this he says but it's absolutely
[1:28:45] impossible that all
[1:28:49] men hear to what the spirit says
[1:28:54] not everyone has that ear I'll say it
[1:28:59] again it's absolutely
[1:29:02] impossible that all
[1:29:06] men can hear what the spirit
[1:29:11] says now Jesus says my sheep hear my
[1:29:15] voice how many can say Amen to
[1:29:18] that Jesus also says this in John
[1:29:23] 105 but a
[1:29:26] stranger they shall not
[1:29:29] follow but on the
[1:29:32] contrary they will flee from
[1:29:36] him because they know not the voice of
[1:29:41] strangers only my sheep hear the voice
[1:29:44] of
[1:29:46] God but when a stranger
[1:29:49] comes and that stranger begins to
[1:29:52] speak they will run away from
[1:29:56] him because they don't know the voice of
[1:30:02] strangers he that has an an ear let him
[1:30:05] hear what the spirit says
[1:30:11] amen may God help us because sometimes
[1:30:14] you you feel like
[1:30:18] running now if you go to Luke 8 verse4
[1:30:26] here is the beginning of when Jesus is
[1:30:28] giving the parable of the
[1:30:38] SE verse four it says and when much
[1:30:41] people were gathered together and were
[1:30:43] come to him out of every city he spake
[1:30:46] by a
[1:30:50] parable
[1:30:52] now I just want you to look at these
[1:30:54] groups that the Lord Jesus is going to
[1:30:59] separate says a swer went out to sew his
[1:31:02] seed and as he
[1:31:06] SED some fell by the
[1:31:11] wayside and was trotten down and the
[1:31:14] fouls of the air devoured it now that's
[1:31:17] one
[1:31:18] group that is by the wayside now verse
[1:31:24] six and some fell upon a
[1:31:28] rock and as soon as it was sprung up it
[1:31:32] withered away because it lacked
[1:31:35] moisture that's the second
[1:31:38] group now this is the third
[1:31:41] group and some fell among
[1:31:47] thorns and the Thorns sprang up with it
[1:31:50] and choked it
[1:31:53] now this is the fourth
[1:32:04] group and other fell on good ground and
[1:32:07] sprang up and bear fruit H hundredfold
[1:32:09] and when he had said these things he
[1:32:11] cried he that hath ears to hear Let Him
[1:32:16] hear now here the Lord is speaking a
[1:32:20] parable and here the
[1:32:23] disciples they asked the Lord
[1:32:26] Jesus they asked what what is the
[1:32:28] meaning of this
[1:32:34] Parable and now here the Lord gives them
[1:32:36] the answer of what this Parable means in
[1:32:40] verse
[1:32:44] 10 and he said unto you it is given to
[1:32:47] know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[1:32:49] God but to others
[1:32:52] in
[1:32:55] Parables that seeing they might not see
[1:32:58] and hearing they might not
[1:33:01] understand
[1:33:05] now the parable is this the seed is the
[1:33:09] word of
[1:33:12] God so a
[1:33:15] seed is a
[1:33:19] word now the Lord here is saying when
[1:33:21] the swer
[1:33:23] came to sew his
[1:33:25] seed he says that's the word of
[1:33:30] God now when a minister stands behind a
[1:33:35] Pulpit wanting and trusting that he is a
[1:33:38] child of
[1:33:39] God that he has the word inside
[1:33:47] him I don't want to say he's tossing but
[1:33:49] he's you know casting the seat of God
[1:33:53] he's speaking the word of
[1:33:55] God to the
[1:33:59] church so the the seed is being
[1:34:05] scattered when the The Prophet's tape is
[1:34:10] playing the seed is being uh scattered
[1:34:13] on the
[1:34:14] earth and there's always those four
[1:34:17] groups some by the
[1:34:20] wayside upon on the Rocks upon the
[1:34:24] thorns and the other ones are good
[1:34:27] ground it's the
[1:34:29] seed but the
[1:34:31] seed comes out of the mouth of God's
[1:34:36] mouth when it comes out of the mouth of
[1:34:39] God it has to come in through the
[1:34:43] ear that's why it says he that have an
[1:34:45] ear let him
[1:34:48] hear now everyone here is hearing what
[1:34:51] I'm saying
[1:34:53] but there's only
[1:34:55] few that are
[1:34:57] understanding what the prophet
[1:35:01] truly truly
[1:35:05] brought because when you hear the
[1:35:07] prophet's
[1:35:09] message you can say well the prophet
[1:35:11] said
[1:35:12] this others others say well the prophet
[1:35:16] meant and another group says no the
[1:35:19] prophet said this it's the
[1:35:22] am
[1:35:25] amen I hope you're not getting getting
[1:35:30] scared now in verse
[1:35:33] 11 it says the seed is the word of
[1:35:39] God now the Lord here begins to break
[1:35:42] down this
[1:35:46] Parable he says those by the
[1:35:48] wayside are they that hear
[1:35:53] says and and then he says then cometh
[1:35:55] the
[1:35:59] devil and taketh away the word out of
[1:36:02] their hearts lest they should believed
[1:36:04] and be
[1:36:06] saved so that's the first group that's
[1:36:08] by the
[1:36:10] wayside he says they are the ones that
[1:36:15] hear they are hearing the word of
[1:36:20] God and and then he says and then cometh
[1:36:22] the
[1:36:25] devil and takes the word out of their
[1:36:28] hearts just like in
[1:36:31] Genesis the serpent came to the
[1:36:35] woman and he said uh the uh God didn't
[1:36:38] really mean
[1:36:39] this you shall surely not
[1:36:44] die trying to take the word that she
[1:36:48] had and if you bring it out to our day
[1:36:52] the devil can
[1:36:55] come and the devil says well the prophet
[1:36:57] didn't mean
[1:37:00] that you can live any kind of life you
[1:37:03] want you can do whatever you
[1:37:06] want you're saved by grace is that
[1:37:11] true the devil also preaches the
[1:37:15] word if there is a good preacher it's
[1:37:18] the
[1:37:19] devil I'll say it again
[1:37:23] if there is a good preacher it's the
[1:37:28] devil he knows Genesis to
[1:37:32] Revelation he can quote you the prophet
[1:37:34] of the message of the
[1:37:37] hour he can quote any verse of the
[1:37:41] Bible and try to get you out of the word
[1:37:43] of
[1:37:44] God that's why when you hear the
[1:37:48] word the devil then always comes
[1:37:52] the devil is always
[1:37:55] present now if you go to
[1:38:00] Hebrews this morning we're going to be
[1:38:02] reading several scriptures of the
[1:38:05] Bible I hope you have your swords with
[1:38:09] you we're going to train ourselves on
[1:38:11] how to wield a
[1:38:16] sword when a soldier in back back then
[1:38:19] they had swords
[1:38:22] they had to train on how to use the
[1:38:25] sword Hebrews
[1:38:36] 2:1 therefore we ought to give the more
[1:38:39] Earnest heed to the things that which we
[1:38:41] have heard lest any time we should let
[1:38:44] them
[1:38:48] slip so the Apostle Paul says we have to
[1:38:51] more earnestly heed the things that we
[1:38:53] have
[1:38:56] heard that way we don't slip or stumble
[1:39:00] or
[1:39:01] fall whenever you hear the message of
[1:39:04] the
[1:39:06] hour we have to earnestly hear
[1:39:10] it closely listening to what the prophet
[1:39:13] is
[1:39:14] saying that way we don't
[1:39:18] slip now Hebrews 4:2
[1:39:35] for for onto US was the Gospel preached
[1:39:38] as well unto them but the word preached
[1:39:41] did not profit them not being mixed with
[1:39:43] faith in them that heard
[1:39:49] it so the uh Apostle Paul is saying that
[1:39:52] we also receive the the good news which
[1:39:54] is the
[1:39:57] gospel it says but it did not profit
[1:40:00] them hearing the
[1:40:02] word because when they heard the
[1:40:05] word it was not mixed with
[1:40:09] faith with them that heard
[1:40:12] it so when you are hearing the
[1:40:16] word it has to be mixed with faith what
[1:40:19] is faith
[1:40:21] faith is believing it though you don't
[1:40:24] understand but you believe
[1:40:28] it faith is something that you cannot
[1:40:30] see something you can't touch that you
[1:40:33] can't taste you can't
[1:40:36] smell but in your hearts you believe
[1:40:42] it you don't understand what the prophet
[1:40:44] just
[1:40:45] said but there's something in you that
[1:40:49] says
[1:40:51] that's the
[1:40:54] truth because your
[1:40:57] heart is a deep calling to a
[1:41:00] deep how is it then
[1:41:02] possible that we are
[1:41:05] here and we hear the messenger and we
[1:41:09] say that's the truth but
[1:41:13] others they receive the
[1:41:16] seed and they say that's a
[1:41:18] devil the prophet himself
[1:41:22] that we say Amen
[1:41:24] to others say that's a
[1:41:27] curse how is it
[1:41:30] possible it's by election or
[1:41:34] predestination that the
[1:41:36] sea fell on good
[1:41:40] ground amen
[1:41:43] Brothers we're just getting
[1:41:46] started so when you hear the
[1:41:49] word it has to be mixed
[1:41:51] and going
[1:41:53] along with
[1:41:55] faith because if Faith does not go along
[1:41:58] with
[1:41:59] it then the word uh escapes us because
[1:42:04] that
[1:42:05] faith faith is Like
[1:42:10] Glue it's the glue that makes the word
[1:42:13] stick amen
[1:42:16] brothers so when you're
[1:42:18] here you must have faith
[1:42:21] believe that this
[1:42:24] word is nothing more but the
[1:42:29] truth we believe that what the messenger
[1:42:31] brought is the
[1:42:34] truth I don't remember what Minister
[1:42:36] said
[1:42:38] this but one of those Ministers of back
[1:42:45] then he says speaking about brother bham
[1:42:47] he says this is the most tremendous man
[1:42:49] on Earth
[1:42:51] or he says or he's the greatest
[1:42:55] impostor but when you in your
[1:42:58] heart every one of you that's sitting
[1:43:01] here and you can hear every
[1:43:04] word some are saying well that's too
[1:43:08] strong or that's not strong
[1:43:11] enough or I don't believe that or I I
[1:43:14] accept that it's the
[1:43:17] seed it that's the word of God
[1:43:24] and every one of us are hearing the
[1:43:27] word you just have to believe the
[1:43:31] word now let's go to uh first
[1:43:35] Thessalonians chapter 2 verse
[1:43:49] 13
[1:43:55] for this cause also thank we god without
[1:43:58] ceasing because when ye reive the word
[1:44:00] of God which ye heard of us ye received
[1:44:03] it not as the word of man but as it is
[1:44:06] in the truth the word of God which
[1:44:09] effectually worketh also in you that
[1:44:14] believe now the Apostle VA in very
[1:44:17] simple terms is saying
[1:44:19] here it says but we cannot but cease
[1:44:22] from thanking
[1:44:24] God because he received the
[1:44:27] word that was not of
[1:44:29] men though it came out of the
[1:44:32] man but you
[1:44:34] understood that it came
[1:44:37] straight from God's
[1:44:41] throne even though it came out of the
[1:44:43] mouth of
[1:44:45] man but it's not the word of
[1:44:48] man I'll say it again
[1:44:53] the Apostle Paul is thanking
[1:44:55] God because this
[1:44:58] people this people
[1:45:02] understood that even though the word
[1:45:04] came out of the mouth of a
[1:45:05] man they
[1:45:08] understood that it was not the message
[1:45:10] of a
[1:45:12] man but it came from God's
[1:45:16] Throne they understood that it's nothing
[1:45:19] more but the truth
[1:45:21] it's God's
[1:45:23] word now let's go back to the Book of
[1:45:30] Luke now we left off on verse
[1:45:34] 12 it says those that hear and then
[1:45:38] cometh the
[1:45:43] devil and taketh away the word out of
[1:45:45] their hearts lest they should believe
[1:45:47] and be saved so the Devil Comes
[1:45:52] and wants to take away that word from
[1:45:54] your
[1:45:55] heart but when you have
[1:45:58] faith it's now yours you own
[1:46:01] it when you hear the
[1:46:03] promise that God will heal
[1:46:06] you that God will deliver
[1:46:08] you you with faith believe
[1:46:11] it but when the Devil comes and you
[1:46:15] don't have
[1:46:16] faith the devil will take it away from
[1:46:19] you but you must have
[1:46:23] faith
[1:46:25] amen now verse
[1:46:28] 13 they on the
[1:46:30] Rock now this is the second
[1:46:33] group now as we're
[1:46:37] reading I want you to identify which
[1:46:40] group you're in you
[1:46:44] are of the ones that are of good
[1:46:48] ground but sometimes we go through
[1:46:49] certain
[1:46:51] sages but don't doubt that you're
[1:46:54] children of
[1:46:57] God says they on the
[1:46:59] Rock are they which when they
[1:47:04] hear so the first group and the second
[1:47:08] group they heard the
[1:47:13] word they receive the word with
[1:47:17] joy when the brother's preaching
[1:47:21] they're receiving it with
[1:47:24] joy oh the brother preaches so
[1:47:27] tremendously they're receiving it with
[1:47:30] joy it says
[1:47:33] however
[1:47:35] these have no
[1:47:39] roots which for a while
[1:47:44] believe and in time of Temptation fall
[1:47:48] away is that you brother is that you
[1:47:51] sister you hear
[1:47:54] it and with you're joyfully enjoying it
[1:47:59] but then the Temptation
[1:48:00] comes I don't want to go to church
[1:48:03] anymore I don't want anything to do with
[1:48:05] God
[1:48:06] anymore my my wife my my family doesn't
[1:48:09] act
[1:48:10] up I'm going to speak very
[1:48:13] simply my old man he won't act up my old
[1:48:17] woman won't
[1:48:18] behave my children won't uh
[1:48:22] behave it's the time of
[1:48:25] Temptation and then they fall
[1:48:27] away they heard the
[1:48:30] word he that hath an ear let him
[1:48:34] hear what the
[1:48:37] spirit sayith unto the
[1:48:42] church we're barely
[1:48:49] starting
[1:48:50] but he says and these have no
[1:48:54] root when the uh the seed
[1:48:58] Falls there has to be the right
[1:49:00] temperature and
[1:49:03] water the the seed is covered by the
[1:49:09] earth and the prophet and even science
[1:49:13] itself it says that there you need
[1:49:17] moisture so that the those roots can
[1:49:19] come out
[1:49:23] now you that have your
[1:49:25] swords let's go back to verse
[1:49:30] six because it's speaking how it fell
[1:49:32] upon the
[1:49:38] rock verse six and some fell upon a rock
[1:49:41] and as soon as it was sprung up it
[1:49:44] withered away because it lacked
[1:49:46] moisture that's the second
[1:49:49] group
[1:49:51] verse six it says it lacked
[1:49:54] moisture now when Jesus explains the
[1:49:57] parable it says that it has no
[1:50:00] roots the word does not make mistakes
[1:50:04] because the roots
[1:50:06] needs uh
[1:50:12] moisture and you in a certain way you
[1:50:14] understand what moisture
[1:50:16] is but but since I'm a bit clumsy
[1:50:21] I went to the dictionary to see what
[1:50:23] moisture
[1:50:27] is moisture is steamed up water in the
[1:50:31] air and how is it
[1:50:34] possible that the
[1:50:38] seed that is placed in the
[1:50:42] ground and then you have the moisture
[1:50:44] that's in the air how how how is it
[1:50:49] possible it's not logic
[1:50:53] it's more logical for you to have water
[1:50:55] in the in the
[1:50:58] ground so then the Holy Ghost
[1:51:02] came he says that's why when you play
[1:51:05] The Prophet's
[1:51:06] tape you press
[1:51:09] play the tape is in the
[1:51:17] air that's why when the messenger came
[1:51:19] and poured out his
[1:51:22] vial it was poured out upon the
[1:51:26] air that moisture is in the
[1:51:29] air that's why it's very important that
[1:51:32] every one of
[1:51:34] us we hear the prophet's
[1:51:37] tapes at your house in your car just
[1:51:42] play
[1:51:43] it though you're not really
[1:51:45] listening but that moisture that
[1:51:48] Steam is in the
[1:51:51] air it's touching the seed of the hearts
[1:51:55] that belongs to you so the
[1:51:58] roots can go
[1:52:03] deeper
[1:52:05] so by the
[1:52:08] reason for some reason we don't hear the
[1:52:11] prophet but the devil attacks us it's I
[1:52:15] fall
[1:52:16] asleep it's too
[1:52:18] boring play the
[1:52:20] tape play the
[1:52:23] tape and those spirits will will go
[1:52:28] away even
[1:52:30] science
[1:52:33] proves that the word is the
[1:52:35] [Music]
[1:52:42] truth now the second group it Withers up
[1:52:45] because it its roots are not very
[1:52:47] deep in the time of Trials
[1:52:51] and they fall away it
[1:52:53] says now the prophet
[1:52:55] says it says every time you shake a
[1:53:02] tree it says it loosens up the root and
[1:53:04] it causes it to grow deeper and
[1:53:08] deeper sometimes we don't like ourselves
[1:53:10] to be
[1:53:11] shaken we don't like the
[1:53:16] trials but sometimes you need yourself
[1:53:18] to be shaken
[1:53:21] that way you can wake
[1:53:22] up oh the
[1:53:25] church you're in the church and
[1:53:28] you're you're you're praying right
[1:53:32] you're
[1:53:34] praying but you need the Deacon to shake
[1:53:36] you okay okay oh I'm sorry I'm sorry I
[1:53:40] got to pay attention
[1:53:43] now you need a
[1:53:48] shaking brother the ROM says every time
[1:53:50] you shake a
[1:53:52] tree it loosens up the
[1:53:56] roots and cause it to grow deeper and
[1:54:01] deeper he says every time the Holy Ghost
[1:54:03] falls on the
[1:54:04] [Music]
[1:54:05] church in an oldfashioned
[1:54:08] Revival it shakes up the
[1:54:14] roots like this so it can get rooted and
[1:54:18] grounded the prophet
[1:54:23] says forgive me that I don't have it up
[1:54:25] there's a bit of an issue but he
[1:54:30] says he says ready for the storms and
[1:54:34] trials when the Holy Ghost
[1:54:36] comes and he shakes
[1:54:39] you and you hear something that the
[1:54:41] prophet says that shakes and it hurts
[1:54:44] you oh that hurt me this hurt me
[1:54:50] that's the Holy Ghost shaking you
[1:54:53] because you are a
[1:54:55] tree and your
[1:54:58] roots they go deeper into the word of
[1:55:00] God and you should say
[1:55:03] Lord even though it
[1:55:06] hurts I want to line up with your word
[1:55:09] if I'm
[1:55:10] wrong tell me Lord correct
[1:55:15] me I want to be put to shame
[1:55:18] here that way I'm not put to shame up
[1:55:21] there so correct me
[1:55:25] Lord that should be our
[1:55:27] attitude the
[1:55:30] attitude and when you hear the prophet
[1:55:33] you hear the pastor or the
[1:55:37] ministry sometimes we bring a message
[1:55:39] that's a bit strong instead of running
[1:55:42] away you should say that's the word it's
[1:55:46] the word you should accept it and say
[1:55:50] Lord I'm
[1:55:52] wrong help
[1:55:55] me and those roots begin to deepen they
[1:55:58] begin to grow the prophet
[1:56:01] says in that
[1:56:05] way they'll get rooted and
[1:56:10] grounded so when a storm
[1:56:13] comes and it blows with the strong
[1:56:18] wind you're not found on the
[1:56:21] Wayside you're still
[1:56:24] standing you're still
[1:56:29] there and the prophet says ready for the
[1:56:31] storms and the
[1:56:33] trials what's the meaning of the trials
[1:56:35] of the
[1:56:36] storms what are the meaning for
[1:56:40] trials to remove all the little trees
[1:56:42] that don't belong there I'll say it
[1:56:46] again what's the point of the storms
[1:56:50] what's the point of the
[1:56:53] trials to remove all those little trees
[1:56:56] that should not be
[1:56:58] there
[1:57:00] amen the prophet
[1:57:03] says he says every time a
[1:57:07] man gets rooted and grounded in God's
[1:57:11] word he says a
[1:57:14] man he doesn't say a church he doesn't
[1:57:16] say a
[1:57:18] group
[1:57:20] he says every time a
[1:57:22] man that's an individual it's
[1:57:29] individually gets rooted and grounded in
[1:57:31] God's
[1:57:33] word what does it say in the God's word
[1:57:36] or in the
[1:57:37] church he says in God's
[1:57:44] word um um I apologize again I'm usually
[1:57:47] always ready but maybe this time it was
[1:57:49] the devil's
[1:57:53] fault he says and every time a man gets
[1:57:55] rooted and grounded in God's
[1:58:01] word he says it roots and grounds him in
[1:58:04] Calvary
[1:58:06] Yonder where the
[1:58:08] anchor the
[1:58:12] tist of God was brought there so the
[1:58:17] man has to be red Ed and grounded in God
[1:58:21] work at
[1:58:24] Calvary in the sacrifice that Jesus
[1:58:26] Christ made but many times we have it
[1:58:31] backwards Chariot how you say Chariot
[1:58:34] wagon a
[1:58:37] wagon sometimes we have the Chariot in
[1:58:39] front of the the
[1:58:41] horse but we need the horse in front of
[1:58:43] the
[1:58:45] Chariot we want it to
[1:58:48] go but we have the Chariot in front of
[1:58:50] the horse how is it going to
[1:58:53] go but if we
[1:58:57] place but if you notice if we place the
[1:59:00] Christian the
[1:59:01] individual if we bring the individual to
[1:59:04] Christ and not to church we bring them
[1:59:08] to
[1:59:09] Christ so when a a trial comes a storm
[1:59:15] comes that
[1:59:17] individual is
[1:59:19] grounded in
[1:59:21] Calvary not in the
[1:59:26] church if we bring the Christian the
[1:59:29] individual to
[1:59:31] Christ then that Christian will come to
[1:59:37] church you have to be rooted in God's
[1:59:41] word grounded in
[1:59:43] calary on what Jesus Christ
[1:59:47] did he died for us
[1:59:50] for our sins and
[1:59:53] trespasses and your
[1:59:56] roots should be grounded
[1:59:59] there and be more rooted in that
[2:00:03] cross imagine a root just entangled in
[2:00:06] the
[2:00:11] cross now verse
[2:00:16] 14 it says those that fell on
[2:00:20] Thorns are they which that have
[2:00:25] heard so this group also heard God's
[2:00:28] word but now
[2:00:30] notice says it says go
[2:00:33] [Music]
[2:00:40] forth and says and are choked with cares
[2:00:43] and riches and pleasures of this life
[2:00:46] and bring no
[2:00:48] fruit
[2:00:51] for those that are bilingual and have
[2:00:52] their Bible in Spanish if you
[2:00:57] notice it says these are the ones that
[2:01:00] hear and then it has a
[2:01:03] comma but it says go forth and then
[2:01:08] comma in my own uh chopped up Spanish
[2:01:11] the way I
[2:01:13] understand in my own way of of
[2:01:16] understanding they
[2:01:18] left they heard the word but then they
[2:01:28] left and it says and are choked with
[2:01:30] cares and riches and pleasures of this
[2:01:32] life and bring no fruit to
[2:01:34] Perfection they
[2:01:37] left they didn't
[2:01:39] stay so that fruit can
[2:01:44] mature it says it didn't bring any fruit
[2:01:47] to Perfection they heard heard the
[2:01:50] word but they didn't produce
[2:01:54] fruit and I said that's so tremendous
[2:01:56] because that's the last
[2:01:59] group that's the the fourth
[2:02:03] group now if you go to the Book of
[2:02:08] James James
[2:02:11] 1:22 the scripture
[2:02:16] says it says but be ye doers of the
[2:02:21] word and not hearers
[2:02:26] only deceiving your own
[2:02:29] selves this is very
[2:02:32] tremendous it says but be
[2:02:36] doers not only hearers of the
[2:02:39] word because everyone here is hearing
[2:02:42] the
[2:02:42] word but not
[2:02:44] everyone not everyone lives the
[2:02:47] word
[2:02:50] we have to live this word that we're
[2:02:53] hearing one part is hearing the
[2:02:57] word the other part is that we live the
[2:03:03] word he says but be ye doers of the
[2:03:09] word it says deceiving your own
[2:03:14] selves a sad thing is when someone else
[2:03:17] deceives you
[2:03:21] when someone deceives you and they lie
[2:03:23] to you but the saddest
[2:03:26] thing is when you
[2:03:28] yourself you deceive
[2:03:31] yourself is you say I'm fine just keep
[2:03:35] trying just go to church on Sundays hear
[2:03:38] the
[2:03:39] word you'll be saved by
[2:03:42] grace you keep going just keep doing
[2:03:45] it just read the verses that suit you
[2:03:52] those uh messages when the prophet is
[2:03:53] just patting you on the
[2:03:56] back the saddest
[2:03:59] thing is when you're lying to
[2:04:03] yourself that's the saddest
[2:04:05] thing a sad thing is when someone
[2:04:08] deceives
[2:04:09] you but the saddest
[2:04:11] thing is when you look in the
[2:04:15] mirror and you're deceiving your own
[2:04:17] self
[2:04:24] because in verse 23 it says for if any
[2:04:26] be a hearer of the
[2:04:29] word and not a
[2:04:36] doer he is like unto a man beholding his
[2:04:39] natural face in a
[2:04:45] glass for he beholdeth himself and goeth
[2:04:48] his way and straight way forgeted what
[2:04:50] manner of man he
[2:05:04] was but who so lookth into the perfect
[2:05:07] law of Liberty and continueth therein he
[2:05:10] being not a forgetful hearer but a doer
[2:05:13] of the work this man shall be blessed in
[2:05:15] his
[2:05:17] deed
[2:05:20] so here it tells us if someone is a
[2:05:22] hearer of the word but not a doer of the
[2:05:25] word is like a person that looks in the
[2:05:28] mirror after he looks he
[2:05:32] leaves and he forgets how he
[2:05:36] looks so you look in the mirror you know
[2:05:39] what you're
[2:05:40] missing I'm missing this I'm missing
[2:05:43] this what is the
[2:05:46] mirror it's the word
[2:05:49] that's the
[2:05:52] mirror you have to be reflected in the
[2:05:54] mirror of God's
[2:05:58] word so you look in the mirror and you
[2:06:01] and the mirror tells you that you're
[2:06:02] missing this and this and this and you
[2:06:04] see
[2:06:06] yourself you see what you're
[2:06:08] [Music]
[2:06:10] missing you leave and then you forget
[2:06:12] what you're missing and then it
[2:06:15] [Music]
[2:06:17] says ISS not being a forgetful
[2:06:22] hearer don't forget what you
[2:06:24] heard what the prophet said what the
[2:06:27] pastor
[2:06:28] said don't forget
[2:06:31] it it should be engraved in your
[2:06:36] heart he says but a doer of the work
[2:06:41] this man the
[2:06:44] individual shall be blessed in his
[2:06:47] deed
[2:06:49] because God will always be with
[2:06:53] you because you'll always carry the word
[2:06:55] in your
[2:06:57] heart oh to the Book of
[2:07:01] John uh St John
[2:07:06] 8:43 here the Lord Jesus is
[2:07:11] speaking he says why do ye not
[2:07:14] understand my
[2:07:15] speech so the Lord has his own speech
[2:07:18] he's
[2:07:21] speaking and these men are not
[2:07:23] understanding his
[2:07:25] speech it says why can't because you
[2:07:28] cannot hear my
[2:07:31] word even because you cannot hear my
[2:07:37] word so the the Lord Jesus be begins to
[2:07:40] speak to them in a very straight
[2:07:44] way he says ye are of your father the
[2:07:47] devil
[2:07:50] and the lust of your father you will
[2:07:58] do he was a murderer from the beginning
[2:08:00] and Abode not in the
[2:08:04] truth and he says and Abode not in the
[2:08:09] truth because there is no truth in
[2:08:13] him when he speaketh a
[2:08:16] lie he speaketh of his own
[2:08:19] for he is a
[2:08:21] liar and father of
[2:08:29] it and because I tell you the truth ye
[2:08:32] believe me
[2:08:35] not and once again and because I tell
[2:08:37] you the truth you believe me
[2:08:45] not which of you convince me of sin and
[2:08:48] if I say the truth why do you not
[2:08:51] believe
[2:08:53] me we're just starting
[2:08:57] here but he starts off by saying you
[2:08:59] don't understand my
[2:09:02] speech he also says that the devil
[2:09:05] speaks he speaks a word is a
[2:09:12] seed God has his own seed and the devil
[2:09:17] also
[2:09:18] has his own
[2:09:23] seed he says when I speak the truth you
[2:09:27] believe me not verse
[2:09:31] 47 it says he that is of
[2:09:35] God heareth God's
[2:09:39] words ye therefore hear them
[2:09:42] not because you are not of
[2:09:46] God he that is of god
[2:09:50] heareth God's
[2:09:51] words he he that have an
[2:09:56] ear let him hear what the spirit of God
[2:09:59] says unto the
[2:10:01] churches but these can't hear
[2:10:04] it because they're not of
[2:10:09] God now um I feel like we're
[2:10:12] understanding more and more the
[2:10:17] word now the brother R speaks about
[2:10:20] about the pleasures of
[2:10:22] life in the message the church and its
[2:10:27] condition for those that have heard this
[2:10:30] uh tape from the
[2:10:32] Prophet this uh portion of the
[2:10:36] tape the prophet in this portion of the
[2:10:39] tape he's
[2:10:40] crying he's a he's in
[2:10:45] tears so I really recommend that you
[2:10:47] listen to this tape
[2:10:50] he says when I have to stand there by
[2:10:53] myself my brother's
[2:10:55] gone my pastor's
[2:10:57] gone my mother's gone my Daddy's Gone my
[2:11:03] wife's gone my kitties are

[2:11:22] do what can I do oh
[2:11:26] [Music]
[2:11:27] Christ I'll stand for you
[2:11:31] now I'll take my choice
[2:11:37] today I'll forfeit all my talking about
[2:11:40] other
[2:11:42] people in other words
[2:11:45] gossip he says I'll forfeit all all my
[2:11:48] talking about other
[2:11:51] people I'll forfeit all my
[2:11:55] temper I'll forfeit all my
[2:11:59] differences I'll forfeit everything

[2:12:25] indifference just all taken off of
[2:12:29] me I believe that's our
[2:12:32] prayer that all of our gos our
[2:12:36] bad our selfish our pride and
[2:12:41] indifferences Lord take them from me

[2:12:47] Lord
[2:12:48] and also I want to stand for
[2:12:51] you as a sheared
[2:12:58] lamb willing to give up all the
[2:13:01] pleasures of what they call pleasures of
[2:13:03] life because this group they
[2:13:09] left because they began to go astr
[2:13:11] because of the pleasures of
[2:13:13] life this life has many
[2:13:16] pleasures and you as a human you have
[2:13:20] your
[2:13:21] flesh you have your
[2:13:23] eyes and there's many
[2:13:26] Pleasures not only for the young people
[2:13:29] but for the
[2:13:31] adults you begin to go astray because of
[2:13:34] the pleasure of Life speaking bad about
[2:13:37] other people your temper and
[2:13:41] differences that's why the prophet says
[2:13:43] Lord Shear me
[2:13:46] off
[2:13:48] but now listen to the words that the
[2:13:50] prophet will
[2:13:54] say willing to give up all the pleasures
[2:13:57] of what they call pleasures of
[2:13:59] life all the
[2:14:01] dances all the
[2:14:04] parties all the old vulgar
[2:14:08] clothes
[2:14:10] makeup
[2:14:16] lipstick fingernail poish
[2:14:21] all this indifference that looks like
[2:14:23] the
[2:14:24] world the pleasures of life dances
[2:14:29] parties old vulgar clothes
[2:14:34] makeup
[2:14:38] lipsticks even the Polish for your
[2:14:41] fingernails says all those
[2:14:44] indifferences that look like the world
[2:14:47] you you
[2:14:50] said don't even act like the
[2:14:54] world don't even associate with the
[2:14:58] world come out of from among them the
[2:15:02] prophet
[2:15:03] says he says help me
[2:15:05] Lord Shear me
[2:15:08] today take me like a
[2:15:13] lamb and let me be
[2:15:15] dumb don't open my mouth
[2:15:20] say nothing about
[2:15:22] it oh the messenger he's speaking about
[2:15:26] about makeup and The
[2:15:29] Temper but
[2:15:30] Lord the prophet
[2:15:33] said he say let me be dumb quiet and not
[2:15:38] open my
[2:15:39] mouth not say anything about
[2:15:42] it Lord if it's your
[2:15:46] word help me to fit with your
[2:15:49] word I want to be corrected here and not
[2:15:53] over
[2:15:54] there so that everyone else can
[2:15:58] see because the word the bride the
[2:16:01] children of
[2:16:02] God are being judged
[2:16:06] now being cheered is something that's
[2:16:10] strong listen to this
[2:16:13] message you can hear how the prophet is
[2:16:16] crying and crying
[2:16:18] you said Lord you have sheared me
[2:16:20] off when you took away my
[2:16:23] wife when you took away my brother you
[2:16:26] took away my
[2:16:28] daughter you really sheared me off
[2:16:31] Lord every one of
[2:16:34] us we have gone through those
[2:16:38] shearings and it's the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:16:41] not the
[2:16:42] devil it's the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:16:45] shearing us not because he hates us he
[2:16:49] loves
[2:16:50] us and a
[2:16:52] sheep stays quiet doesn't say anything
[2:16:56] and says
[2:16:57] Lord Cheer Me
[2:17:00] Lord I want to be right with your
[2:17:08] word in Luke
[2:17:11] 8:15 this is now the last
[2:17:14] group everyone heard the word
[2:17:19] some left because the devil
[2:17:20] came others
[2:17:23] left because they have no roots in
[2:17:26] them the third group
[2:17:29] left because of the pleasures of life
[2:17:32] makeup
[2:17:34] partying
[2:17:37] money but now here comes that fourth
[2:17:41] group he says but that on the good
[2:17:46] ground
[2:17:48] are they which in in honest and good
[2:17:51] hearts and
[2:17:54] honest having heard the word keep
[2:17:59] it and bring forth fruit with
[2:18:02] patience they heard the
[2:18:05] word but they also keep it in their
[2:18:09] heart even though it hurt
[2:18:12] them but they keep it in their
[2:18:14] hearts and they bring forth fruits
[2:18:18] now the prophet
[2:18:20] says in closing now do you love
[2:18:24] me you love God you love his word amen
[2:18:30] now the prophet
[2:18:31] says in uh the message Jehovah Gyra
[2:18:34] number
[2:18:35] two he says and we know that a
[2:18:38] seed now
[2:18:40] remember the devil has his own seed and
[2:18:44] God has his own
[2:18:45] seed but later on will go into
[2:18:48] that now we're speaking about the seed
[2:18:50] of
[2:18:51] God he says and we know that a
[2:18:56] seed when it falls on the right
[2:19:00] ground not on rocks without
[2:19:04] roots neither on Thorns or
[2:19:09] thistles that will be quick to choke
[2:19:14] it but with a good rich and fertile
[2:19:18] Faith you must have faith believe the
[2:19:23] word believe in and accept the
[2:19:27] word every seed will bring forth
[2:19:29] according to its kind and we know that
[2:19:32] every
[2:19:33] seed or promise of
[2:19:36] God will bring forth according to its
[2:19:40] kind what he
[2:19:43] promised now the prophet
[2:19:45] says he says the Earth Earth will be
[2:19:48] struck in other words the
[2:19:51] heart he says the Earth will be prepared
[2:19:54] and made
[2:19:55] ready that's why in Psalms it
[2:19:58] says it says oh God cleanse my
[2:20:02] heart so I can have a clean and upright
[2:20:05] heart before
[2:20:07] you all the stones have been Cast
[2:20:16] Away when you're at your house and
[2:20:18] you're going to uh plant uh plants or or
[2:20:22] flowers first you have to prepare the
[2:20:26] ground all the stones that are there you
[2:20:28] have to throw them
[2:20:31] out you also have to dig up the ground
[2:20:34] to find the stones that are buried
[2:20:39] underneath that's why the prophet is
[2:20:41] saying these
[2:20:43] words that the Earth will be
[2:20:46] struck the Earth Earth is being
[2:20:48] prepared all the stones have been thrown
[2:20:51] out the
[2:20:53] roots and the
[2:20:55] bitterness and the selfish indifferences
[2:21:00] jealousy everything has been plucked
[2:21:03] up that root of bitterness that
[2:21:13] Springs that so many times it ruins what
[2:21:16] God is trying to
[2:21:18] do God wants to speak to your
[2:21:21] heart God wants to work in your
[2:21:26] lives but that root of bitterness that
[2:21:28] you
[2:21:31] carry is getting in the way of what God
[2:21:33] wants to
[2:21:34] do uh preparing the ground is something
[2:21:38] that's
[2:21:40] hard you have to pluck up all the
[2:21:43] roots and say
[2:21:46] Lord help me to bring out this root of
[2:21:50] bitterness this root of
[2:21:52] selfishness this root of
[2:21:55] Pride there's a lot of
[2:21:57] roots not only a
[2:21:59] bitterness but there's many
[2:22:03] roots like there's a root of
[2:22:06] God there's also a root of selfishness a
[2:22:10] pride of all those kinds of
[2:22:13] roots but brother God wants to bless you
[2:22:18] sister God wants to bless you but that
[2:22:21] roots of Pride
[2:22:24] selfishness a
[2:22:26] bitterness is getting in the
[2:22:30] way of what God is trying to do the
[2:22:33] prophet
[2:22:34] says he says Lord we
[2:22:37] pray that that be not so in
[2:22:43] us but the good word can find good
[2:22:46] ground in US
[2:22:48] please
[2:22:51] stand I apologize I didn't have the
[2:22:53] quotes on the
[2:22:59] screen you love the Lord
[2:23:04] am I hope God can help
[2:23:09] us that God's word had May reach your
[2:23:14] ear and come into your heart
[2:23:17] and touch our
[2:23:20] hearts he that have an ear let him
[2:23:24] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[2:23:29] churches but it's the
[2:23:33] individual it's not the entire church
[2:23:37] it's the
[2:23:42] individual we're reaching the the
[2:23:44] highest
[2:23:46] point
[2:23:48] where the bride and the
[2:23:51] word will be
[2:23:53] one do you believe
[2:23:55] that that's something that's
[2:23:59] biblical I'll say it
[2:24:02] again it's
[2:24:04] biblical and everything that's in the
[2:24:08] Bible That's thus sayth the
[2:24:12] Lord in Revelations
[2:24:16] 2217
[2:24:19] by this chapter in the Bible everything
[2:24:20] is closing
[2:24:23] now we're in Revelation chapter
[2:24:26] 22 everything is
[2:24:30] [Music]
[2:24:31] finishing but Revelations
[2:24:35] 22:17 says and the
[2:24:37] spirit and the
[2:24:39] bride
[2:24:44] [Music]
[2:24:45] say doesn't say that the spirit
[2:24:48] says it says the
[2:24:51] spirit and the
[2:24:53] bride
[2:24:55] both
[2:24:56] say
[2:24:59] come and he that hears he that
[2:25:03] Hearth say
[2:25:05] come and let him that th come and
[2:25:09] whosoever
[2:25:11] will let him take the Water of
[2:25:14] Life
[2:25:15] freely
[2:25:18] it doesn't say only the
[2:25:20] spirit in other words the Holy Ghost
[2:25:22] Jesus
[2:25:23] Christ because by this
[2:25:26] time the spirit and the bride are now
[2:25:30] one but here the
[2:25:34] bride and the word are joining
[2:25:39] together right now they're joining
[2:25:44] together so when this time is
[2:25:48] fulfilled the spirit and the bride are
[2:25:52] joined
[2:25:54] together because now the bride has
[2:25:56] become the
[2:25:58] word the bride has dressed herself with
[2:26:00] the word she
[2:26:02] stayed quiet and she was
[2:26:05] sheered she
[2:26:07] heard what the spirit said she had fell
[2:26:10] in her heart she accepted it she dressed
[2:26:14] herself with the
[2:26:15] word
[2:26:17] and now the spirit and the bride both
[2:26:22] [Music]
[2:26:23] say he that
[2:26:25] Hearth they're going to say
[2:26:28] come he that Hearth say
[2:26:31] come and he that a thirst let him
[2:26:34] come are you
[2:26:36] thirsting are you thirsting
[2:26:40] sister then come and drink of this Water
[2:26:43] of Life it won't cost you anything it's
[2:26:48] free it you won't be charged anything
[2:26:51] it's
[2:26:53] free but when you drink this water it's
[2:26:57] impossible for you to go back to the
[2:27:00] world and go back to the
[2:27:03] garbage you tasted that rich water and

[2:27:42] that
[2:27:44] water will give water and will water the
[2:27:46] word of God that seed that's in your
[2:27:51] heart he that has an ear let him
