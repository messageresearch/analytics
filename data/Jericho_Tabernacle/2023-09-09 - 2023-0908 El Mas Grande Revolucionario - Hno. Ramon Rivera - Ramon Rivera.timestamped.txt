[23:20] Seth Enoch Robles
[23:25] um
[23:27] so tonight we just want to dedicate this
[23:29] child
[23:33] the Fathers as well to the hands of our
[23:35] God
[23:37] and we know that in the Bible says that
[23:58] I just want to read a base scripture
[24:05] which is the base scripture of why we do
[24:08] this
[24:10] Mark 10 13. this is
[24:19] and they brought young children to him
[24:21] that he should touch him and his
[24:23] disciples rebuke those who brought them
[24:26] Jesus
[24:34] but Jesus saw it and he was much
[24:36] displeased and said unto them suffer the
[24:38] little children to come up to me and
[24:40] forbid them not for such is the kingdom
[24:43] of God
[24:44] so if you can please just bow your heads
[24:47] we can pray
[24:48] thank you
[24:52] [Music]
[24:58] and Lord gracious Heavenly Father
[25:02] tonight Lord
[25:05] we're here with the family
[25:07] [Music]
[25:19] for we know that the Bible says
[25:27] that even though even though I wasn't
[25:30] even in the womb of my mother you still
[25:32] knew me
[25:35] for we know that everyone that came into
[25:38] the Earth is predestinated
[25:41] for a certain purpose
[25:43] and you take care of the child
[25:47] just as you took care of Moses
[25:50] Jesus and you took Jesus
[25:54] you can also take care of this child
[25:59] and Lord we plead and ask for your
[26:01] blessings
[26:07] we always Camp around them
[26:09] [Music]
[26:13] and to keep forward on the Walk of God
[26:18] we also asked for the fathers
[26:22] may you help them
[26:24] may you give them the wisdom
[26:27] that comes from your word
[26:31] so they can guide their little little
[26:34] child
[26:36] and also the rest of their families
[26:39] and Lord we ask for this blessing
[26:44] for we know this comes straight from
[26:46] your word
[26:47] and we ask all of this
[26:50] Lord Jesus Christ
[26:52] [Music]

[33:52] [Music]
[34:04] thank you
[34:06] [Music]
[34:12] [Music]
[34:27] order
[34:29] [Music]
[34:31] Ed
[34:36] their eyes
[34:41] [Music]
[34:51] [Music]
[34:58] [Music]
[35:04] this is
[35:07] [Music]
[35:33] we all need more of our Lord Jesus
[35:36] Christ
[35:39] and that's the reason why we're in this
[35:41] place
[35:43] we've come to fill our hearts
[35:47] to fill our spirit
[35:49] like a brother would say
[35:53] and to recharge the batteries
[35:57] stuck
[36:15] it's good being made around us forgive
[36:17] me brother
[36:20] we're going to read a scripture
[36:23] gracias our brother and our musicians
[36:26] thank you so much
[36:28] you're very kind
[36:31] yeah
[36:37] we're going to read a scripture which is
[36:39] the basis of this small
[36:41] thoughts yo
[36:46] small thought that the lord gave us
[36:51] is
[37:03] came to me when I was listening to
[37:05] something about a very famous leader
[37:07] there in Mexico
[37:11] [Music]
[37:12] I don't want to say his name but he's
[37:14] the one that governs all of Mexico
[37:19] and he was asked if he was a Christian
[37:22] or if he was a Catholic
[37:25] Cristiano if you're a Christian or
[37:28] you're a Catholic foreign
[37:35] [Music]
[37:58] but I want to follow the footsteps of
[38:01] Jesus
[38:03] I want to follow his Footprints
[38:08] because Jesus was the opposer in his
[38:12] time
[38:14] against
[38:16] all the government in the system against
[38:18] him
[38:22] to the point where those that were
[38:24] governing there
[38:29] they condemned him and they killed him
[38:33] he didn't say many words brothers
[38:36] pero Perez
[38:39] but that came to my heart
[38:46] and I said well I'm going to speak to my
[38:48] brothers about that
[38:53] it's been so many years that I haven't
[38:55] stood behind a Pulpit
[39:01] honestly I tell you and I'm not here to
[39:03] start lying to anybody
[39:05] but
[39:08] the word of God is always burning in my
[39:10] heart
[39:31] and I hope that with all all of my heart
[39:36] that's something of this part of this
[39:38] message
[39:40] can serve you for good
[39:43] can help you in your walk
[39:47] and can guide you Allah
[39:51] on to the footsteps of our Lord Jesus
[39:54] Christ
[39:55] this could be me forgive me
[40:02] we're in Matthew chapter 10 verse 34
[40:08] .
[40:09] the word of God says
[40:11] if you found it already
[40:22] passed
[40:26] Espada
[40:27] think not that I am come to send peace
[40:30] on Earth I am come not to send peace but
[40:33] a sword
[40:37] and in the gospel of Saint Luke
[40:42] chapter 12 verse 51
[40:45] .
[40:48] and he says the same thing but in a
[40:51] different form
[40:52] this is a in signals the interrogation
[40:56] in the form of interrogation like that
[40:59] of a question
[41:06] no
[41:10] suppose ye that I am come to give peace
[41:13] on Earth I tell you nay but rather
[41:16] division
[41:17] is
[41:22] you can read the following scriptures 52
[41:25] and 53.
[41:33] it'll say it's be father against the son
[41:35] against the Father the daughter against
[41:36] the mother
[41:40] the daughter-in-law against the
[41:42] mother-in-law
[41:44] and it says all of that there
[41:47] why
[41:49] to follow Jesus
[41:53] Jesus the other isn't
[41:56] foreign
[42:28] because he's come to put division
[42:32] is
[42:34] Cristiano but what about you which is
[42:36] firm and a Christian
[42:40] that has to continue the footsteps of
[42:43] the Lord
[42:46] if you like to be seated forgive me
[42:49] brother
[42:51] is
[42:55] this theme is called the greatest
[42:58] revolutionary
[43:03] maybe the word revolutionary
[43:08] might sound a little exaggerated
[43:14] when talking about the Lord Jesus Christ
[43:18] existed
[43:23] revolutionarios but in the word of God
[43:25] there exists many revolutionaries
[43:30] if you go to the Old Testament Brothers
[43:35] you'll find out that Joshua was Joseph
[43:39] was a revolutionary
[43:43] when he was a young man
[43:48] he had dreams and he had Visions
[43:54] I'm not going to read it to you you've
[43:56] read it and you already know it
[44:00] Joseph had Visions
[44:03] he saw that he was seated upon a throne
[44:10] and his his brother were beneath him
[44:13] like worshiping him
[44:24] as they worshiped him him
[44:30] so he had those Visions even being a
[44:33] young man
[44:35] you know how he was sold by his brothers
[44:39] how he was taken to Egypt
[44:44] the Lord had to place him in a prison
[45:02] [Music]
[45:29] as second in charge over the whole
[45:31] country
[45:42] the Egyptian people and the and the
[45:44] Israeli people his brothers
[45:46] from dying of hunger
[45:51] I'm getting ahead of myself a little bit
[45:54] yeah
[46:00] foreign
[46:07] before continuing I'd just like to say I
[46:10] believe it's prudent
[46:11] um
[46:13] that I can present myself before you all
[46:20] I'd like to share a small testimony of
[46:22] my life
[46:25] and it's more so so that those people
[46:29] those brethren
[46:38] nor did they know my family
[46:46] cuatro we got here to this message in
[46:48] the year 2004.
[46:51] in uh in the Iglesia
[46:54] Garcia at the church of our brother
[46:56] bernabe Garcia
[47:02] and we got there by the attendance of a
[47:05] brother that he attends here
[47:08] his name is Alfredo Sosa
[47:13] he's got more or less the same age as I
[47:17] have he works alongside with me
[47:21] in the company
[47:24] is
[47:26] and he was hired the same day that I was
[47:29] hired
[47:31] I was in the denomination
[47:36] he started to speak to me of the prophet
[47:42] every time that we go out to eat
[47:50] bring me a message and talk to me and
[47:52] I'd listen to him
[47:55] he started placing a seed in my heart
[48:00] he had plenty of patience brothers
[48:06] because he started doing this since the
[48:08] year in 1999.
[48:13] all the way to 2004 five years had
[48:15] passed
[48:22] so that I could come to the feet but
[48:24] better said so I can come to the message
[48:28] my family and I were already Christians
[48:34] but we came to get to know all of this
[48:37] and we just fell in love
[48:40] yeah
[48:44] and we've been here for all the years of
[48:46] our life
[48:48] alfredo
[48:49] no libros brother Alfredo he gave me
[48:52] some books
[48:55] some books that impacted me so much
[48:59] books of the prophet
[49:02] foreign
[49:20] I know that you've read it
[49:28] that that book it impacted my mind it
[49:32] just shook my brain
[49:35] and I said Within Myself
[49:38] this makes sense
[49:42] this makes sense
[49:45] I started going back to the word of God
[49:49] and I compared them
[49:52] he graciasuke
[49:59] denomination thank God that impacted me
[50:01] so much I was able to get away from the
[50:03] denomination
[50:06] and I could embrace the message
[50:10] Anton says
[50:13] so then going back to what I was telling
[50:15] you
[50:22] thanks to our brother alfredo sauce
[50:25] he had the patience
[50:28] to work with me they call me familiar
[50:33] and with my family
[50:36] and for my whole life I'd be grateful
[50:39] for that
[50:44] to the point where just a small
[50:46] testimony
[50:50] I'd like to tell you so that you can get
[50:52] to know me better
[50:55] okay
[50:59] I come from a very small town
[51:06] I was born in a town called
[51:12] Veracruz about 40 kilometers north of
[51:15] Veracruz
[51:18] [Music]
[51:19] when I was born there wasn't any
[51:21] electricity in that town
[51:27] I pertain to a very humble home
[51:31] my father
[51:33] didn't have land
[51:39] we just worked off we just lived off of
[51:42] what he worked doing
[51:46] economics and we live very difficult
[51:50] Financial situations
[51:54] it's six of six brothers
[51:57] Una
[52:00] Yuna Romano it was five males and one
[52:03] female he
[52:05] is
[52:07] and the situation is very difficult
[52:13] my father immigrated to the city of
[52:15] Veracruz
[52:18] there he found a better job
[52:21] foreign
[52:31] and then once in the city
[52:35] we could prepare ourselves
[52:38] we could study
[52:44] my father worked very hard so that we
[52:46] can get an education
[52:48] we
[52:51] isos we're very proud for that
[52:56] the Lord took me
[53:01] when I was in the sixth semester
[53:05] mechanical electrical electrical
[53:08] engineer
[53:12] is
[53:14] some of you know that I'm a mechanical
[53:16] electrical
[53:19] engineering
[53:22] I went and I took my exam and I passed
[53:25] there in
[53:27] veracruzana they're in the Veracruz
[53:29] University
[53:32] and also my brothers
[53:38] and
[53:41] I tell you this Brothers not to think
[53:44] that I'm something great but
[53:47] just so that you can see
[53:52] where the Lord took me out of
[53:57] from the sixth semester of engineering
[54:03] I wanted to know why the moon wouldn't
[54:06] strike the Earth
[54:09] [Music]
[54:11] I wanted to know what happens when two
[54:13] cars Collide
[54:16] how to build a turbine
[54:21] um
[54:22] and how a combustion engine works
[54:28] that took me that drove me to study all
[54:31] that I studied
[54:33] but then the day came where I said
[54:39] and I said who was it that formed the
[54:41] Earth
[54:42] the one that formed the Earth
[54:52] if within the Earth lies the materials
[54:55] and the steel which we make the cars
[54:57] with
[55:01] we can build a car and we work the steel
[55:05] but who placed it there
[55:08] who put the moon there yeah
[55:11] who put the Stars over there amen
[55:14] entrances told us of buenos
[55:20] so that all that that I studied then for
[55:23] what
[55:24] is
[55:27] I wanted to know what why this
[55:30] is
[55:35] how the Lord took me yeah
[55:40] and I started to follow the lord Jesus
[55:43] Christ
[55:45] someone spoke to me of the Lord Jesus
[55:47] Christ
[55:51] and then I understood it in my heart
[55:55] there was no other solution
[55:59] so then briefly Brothers
[56:07] just wanted to say this for those
[56:09] Brothers
[56:10] they don't know my family
[56:14] we come from there yes
[56:18] we were with our brother Bernie
[56:22] for some Years also with the brothers
[56:26] and now here we are
[56:30] Familia this has been our family
[56:40] our brother obedience
[56:47] from way back in those years up to now
[56:50] Los Angeles
[56:51] and the years don't pass in vain bien
[56:54] Hermanos very well Brothers
[57:02] but let us continue
[57:07] Brothers the females
[57:23] about the greatest revolutionary
[57:29] [Music]
[57:30] um
[57:31] and I'd like to just abbreviate real
[57:33] quick
[57:34] the
[57:35] [Music]
[57:38] the word revolutionary
[57:44] the word revolutionary according to the
[57:47] dictionary
[57:54] as means a person who's actively
[57:56] participating in A revolution is
[58:02] a person that's a part of
[58:05] ideologies
[58:07] a revolutionary ideologies is
[58:15] and another dictionary it says someone
[58:17] who stirs things up
[58:19] and a turbulent person
[58:23] but Brothers
[58:25] in in el mundo avido muchas personas but
[58:30] in the world there's been many people of
[58:32] this type
[58:33] with ideals
[58:36] and because of time
[58:42] I'm just going to show you a few
[58:44] examples that are more significant
[58:46] chronological chronologically
[58:55] the first Revolution and revolutionary
[58:58] that I remember
[59:00] was called robespiere
[59:05] this man Maxim miliano Robin
[59:10] he started the French Revolution
[59:14] taking the Baton Paris there to to Paris
[59:20] and he rebelled
[59:23] he rebelled
[59:27] absolutismo De Los Reyes against all of
[59:31] the absolute of the Kings
[59:36] if you've read a little bit of the
[59:38] French Revolution
[59:44] you know that the king had the absolute
[59:46] power within his hands
[59:49] the revolutionaries
[59:55] they stripped That Power from the King
[59:57] they got him out
[1:00:02] him and his wife Mary antonetta is
[1:00:07] we're talking about Louis XVI is
[1:00:15] to sum it up that was the French
[1:00:17] Revolution
[1:00:20] and it was established
[1:00:24] um
[1:00:28] during the leadership of this man
[1:00:30] robespiere
[1:00:32] declaration
[1:00:34] They promoted the Declaration of
[1:00:37] Independence of man either and of the
[1:00:40] citizens
[1:00:44] that established a series of basic
[1:00:46] rights
[1:00:48] for all citizens
[1:00:56] he was executed in 1964.
[1:01:10] who liberated and did great things
[1:01:13] was Abraham Lincoln
[1:01:16] foreign
[1:01:28] unto his death
[1:01:30] principal
[1:01:32] Motivo era abolition
[1:01:35] his main motive was to abolish slavery
[1:01:38] de los afro-americano of the African
[1:01:41] Americans
[1:01:44] in all the states of the Union
[1:01:48] as many of us already
[1:01:51] knows
[1:01:52] the 23 states of the north
[1:01:57] they were against slavery
[1:02:02] and all the southern states
[1:02:05] they were in favor of slavery
[1:02:13] discuss the separation of the states
[1:02:16] in parentheses
[1:02:20] separation
[1:02:26] it was the Civil War that we had in this
[1:02:29] country
[1:02:35] Abraham Lincoln tried to come and to
[1:02:38] work with the Southern States
[1:02:43] but the southern states they started the
[1:02:45] war tomando Uno de los fuertes De Los
[1:02:48] Estados Del Norte taking one of the
[1:02:50] taking one of the strongholds of the
[1:02:52] states in the north
[1:02:55] and you know how Abraham Lincoln he died
[1:03:01] there's a message of the Prophet brother
[1:03:04] Branham
[1:03:05] that's called a paradox
[1:03:13] it says like this Brothers
[1:03:17] when I was a young man
[1:03:23] I'd sit down and read my history book
[1:03:27] I was reading one day
[1:03:30] Abraham Lincoln and I saw there were
[1:03:33] Abraham Lincoln
[1:03:35] he got down from a train
[1:03:38] there in New Orleans
[1:03:45] and they were selling a
[1:03:48] slave a black slave
[1:03:52] location
[1:03:56] and they wanted to use him to to mix him
[1:03:59] with other large women
[1:04:03] to create better slaves
[1:04:11] they wanted to mix him in with a large
[1:04:14] statured women
[1:04:29] Abraham Lincoln took off his his hat
[1:04:33] and he squeezed his uh fist
[1:04:38] he was also from Kentucky
[1:04:41] he said
[1:04:44] he said that's wrong
[1:04:48] and he repeated again
[1:04:52] that's wrong
[1:04:58] and the prophet said even I say that's
[1:05:01] wrong
[1:05:03] God made man
[1:05:05] el hombre is
[1:05:08] man-made slaves
[1:05:10] amen amen
[1:05:17] we could mention some other
[1:05:18] revolutionary man brothers
[1:05:20] that were leaders
[1:05:24] and then thousands of people followed
[1:05:27] themes
[1:05:29] trying to change the social economical
[1:05:32] system the surprise of their country
[1:05:36] like Vladimir Lenin and Russia in Russia
[1:05:40] Mahatma Gandhi and La India Gandhi in
[1:05:43] India in Mexico
[1:05:47] in Mexico we should we can mention
[1:05:49] Juarez
[1:06:00] that would take away all the riches from
[1:06:02] the Catholic church
[1:06:05] and separate the church the government
[1:06:07] from the church
[1:06:09] foreign
[1:06:39] and I believe we all know about these
[1:06:41] two revolutionaries
[1:06:44] both fought for their ideals
[1:06:47] for a more just country para los
[1:06:51] Mexicanos for the Mexicans
[1:06:56] but both also paid with their lives
[1:07:00] every one of you knows
[1:07:03] that they were killed yes and murdered
[1:07:07] they were persecuted and murdered see
[1:07:15] was murdered Zapata
[1:07:20] and I'm sure there in the south
[1:07:23] being very well
[1:07:28] es
[1:07:32] the ideals and the change
[1:07:40] the form and the way that we were able
[1:07:42] to realize these changes through our
[1:07:44] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:47] we can see it clearly
[1:07:55] sermon on the mountain was the first
[1:07:57] place Brothers
[1:08:01] the first sermon the Lord Jesus gave us
[1:08:04] he got up to the mountains and he saw
[1:08:08] the multitude
[1:08:12] without a pastor it is and and forgive
[1:08:16] me
[1:08:19] and he said this
[1:08:22] is
[1:08:25] and it's chapter five six and seven of
[1:08:28] the Book of Matthew
[1:08:31] I'm just going to show you a few
[1:08:35] but you can read it
[1:08:38] easily at home
[1:08:43] he declares unto his disciples the
[1:08:45] beginning of his kingdom Christo
[1:08:51] convert in this message the Lord Jesus
[1:08:55] confirms and reaffirms the Mosaic law
[1:08:58] um
[1:09:00] as the core of his Earthly Kingdom
[1:09:05] the Earthly Kingdom that is coming
[1:09:08] in
[1:09:11] Matthew 5 17 it says
[1:09:16] don't think that I've come to stir up
[1:09:19] the law or the prophets
[1:09:23] I haven't come for that
[1:09:30] how many of you have read this amen amen
[1:09:37] the Lord Jesus also tells us that the
[1:09:40] attitude of man
[1:09:41] for this
[1:09:45] shall determine his place in King in
[1:09:48] heaven
[1:09:49] erate
[1:09:54] in the kingdom and if anyone were to
[1:09:57] break these Commandments
[1:10:06] the least shall be called in the Kingdom
[1:10:08] of Heaven
[1:10:13] but whoever would do so yes
[1:10:16] and would teach them
[1:10:21] shall be caught great in the Kingdom of
[1:10:24] Heaven
[1:10:25] foreign
[1:10:39] and
[1:10:47] the intention
[1:10:49] amen amen
[1:10:54] in verse 27 of chapter 5.
[1:10:59] have you heard that it was said
[1:11:03] thou shall not commit adultery
[1:11:07] but I say unto you that whosoever
[1:11:11] look it's on a woman to lust after her
[1:11:15] you have committed adultery with her
[1:11:18] already in his heart
[1:11:22] and If thy right eye offended
[1:11:27] pluck it out and cast it from
[1:11:32] for it is profitable for thee one of thy
[1:11:34] members should perish
[1:11:38] and not that thy whole body should be
[1:11:40] cast into hell
[1:11:47] the perfect standard of Justice required
[1:11:50] by our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:11:52] is
[1:11:55] in chapter 5 verse 48.
[1:12:01] be ye therefore perfect
[1:12:05] even as your father which is in heaven
[1:12:08] is perfect is perfect
[1:12:15] us today they're in this dispensation
[1:12:21] what happens with all the redeemed
[1:12:27] because we're not under the laws
[1:12:32] we are under grace
[1:12:37] Romans 6 14.
[1:12:42] for sin shall not have dominion over you
[1:12:48] for you're not under the law
[1:12:51] but under grace amen amen
[1:12:58] I would add to that the paragraph that
[1:13:01] says
[1:13:02] in John 1 12.
[1:13:06] he came to his own
[1:13:09] but his own did not receive him
[1:13:13] but to all those that received him
[1:13:16] he gave them power to become egos sons
[1:13:21] of God
[1:13:26] those which the word says
[1:13:33] which are redeemed
[1:13:35] Los cuales
[1:13:40] which were redeemed
[1:13:46] I mean
[1:13:52] that's the part that I added
[1:13:56] there's a message
[1:14:01] it's called the exposition of the seven
[1:14:03] Church ages and it says
[1:14:06] it doesn't have a paragraph in
[1:14:10] Divine service
[1:14:14] you always hear the words of man
[1:14:18] then the word of God
[1:14:21] of the power of the keys
[1:14:25] the church has almost lost
[1:14:29] the power to bind
[1:14:35] all that's left is losing power
[1:14:40] just that thing is was necessary
[1:14:44] to go back to Christ
[1:14:47] to look to Christ
[1:14:50] as the only leader
[1:14:54] and to walk in his footsteps
[1:14:57] in elementary
[1:15:00] and the message go and tell my disciples
[1:15:04] paragraph 41.
[1:15:08] the life of the great men they remind us
[1:15:14] we can make our lives
[1:15:18] and we leave behind us
[1:15:23] footprints in the sands of time
[1:15:28] footprints that perhaps another
[1:15:33] sailing over life's solemn Maine
[1:15:39] a forlorn and Shipwrecked brother
[1:15:42] alberlas
[1:15:47] shall take their heart again
[1:15:55] the Revolutionary system of our Lord
[1:15:58] Jesus Christ
[1:15:59] it was very distinct
[1:16:02] EMA the cameos
[1:16:05] revolutions to the system of change that
[1:16:08] these revolutionary leaders have have
[1:16:10] had
[1:16:13] that have existed on the earth
[1:16:16] throughout all the ages
[1:16:24] because the Lord Jesus Christ in Matthew
[1:16:27] 5 43
[1:16:28] this is
[1:16:31] you have heard that it was said
[1:16:35] Thou shalt love thy neighbor
[1:16:38] and hate thine enemy
[1:16:49] bless them that curse you I said
[1:16:53] do that do good to them that hate you
[1:16:58] and pray for them which despitefully use
[1:17:01] you and persecute you
[1:17:06] might be the children of your father
[1:17:08] which is in heaven
[1:17:11] for you make it the sun rise on evil and
[1:17:14] the good
[1:17:17] and send it rain on the just and on the
[1:17:20] unjust
[1:17:24] he left us instructions on how to pray
[1:17:29] he taught us not to judge the rest
[1:17:34] he left us the Golden Rule
[1:17:40] how many remember the Golden Rule
[1:17:46] I thought that if we all follow the
[1:17:49] Golden Rule
[1:17:53] Church would be something else
[1:17:55] and the world
[1:18:00] I'm going to read it for you in case
[1:18:02] somebody forgot
[1:18:06] so all things
[1:18:11] that you want man to do to you
[1:18:16] do also unto them
[1:18:22] for this is the law and the prophets
[1:18:28] this is a thought that breaks everything
[1:18:35] if you want a cold glass of water in the
[1:18:37] time of heat
[1:18:41] you've got to First give it to your
[1:18:43] neighbor
[1:18:44] you understood me in
[1:18:48] a few words that's what the Lord is
[1:18:50] trying to tell us
[1:18:52] if you want something more
[1:18:58] [Music]
[1:18:59] maybe you want some expensive shoes
[1:19:06] first give the shoes
[1:19:09] just the way you want them
[1:19:12] the 200 kind for example
[1:19:15] he is you stayed in that opportunity
[1:19:19] and you'll have the opportunity that
[1:19:21] someone could give it to you
[1:19:23] it's got to start with yourself
[1:19:29] we're always waiting to come from
[1:19:31] another
[1:19:32] um
[1:19:36] well the brother is going to bring me
[1:19:38] some cake
[1:19:40] first you take it to them
[1:19:43] that's it it says that's the Golden Rule
[1:19:49] forgive me
[1:20:00] to close this Brothers
[1:20:07] I want to tell you that when the Lord
[1:20:09] was here on the earth
[1:20:11] as a human being
[1:20:15] just like us
[1:20:21] he also rebelled against what was
[1:20:24] established
[1:20:29] I don't know if you remember he made a
[1:20:31] act with the court before templo and he
[1:20:34] went to the temple
[1:20:36] and then he destroyed everything
[1:20:39] he flipped the tables
[1:20:42] and he scolded all of them
[1:20:46] you made the house of my father
[1:20:48] um
[1:20:52] a den of Thieves
[1:20:56] oh
[1:20:58] Los governantes the governors of this
[1:21:01] time this day
[1:21:03] on that day
[1:21:06] they were offended
[1:21:10] they looked for a way
[1:21:13] they look for a word
[1:21:16] how to trap him
[1:21:20] to imprison him and then kill him
[1:21:27] that's why Jesus always told them their
[1:21:30] truths to their face
[1:21:32] he's called them Hypocrites
[1:21:36] white and sepulchers
[1:21:40] there on the outside you look beautiful
[1:21:44] but on the inside you're full of rotten
[1:21:49] bones
[1:21:50] of worldliness
[1:21:57] [Music]
[1:22:03] a code of righteousness for all the
[1:22:06] Christians
[1:22:08] they believe in his name yes
[1:22:12] and we're waiting for his coming
[1:22:16] he is our leader
[1:22:18] Cristiano because to be a Christian is
[1:22:22] to follow the footprints
[1:22:25] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:22:28] to continue his footsteps is
[1:22:32] to be like Christ
[1:22:48] apart from the book of Acts
[1:22:51] you can also read
[1:22:56] when he appeared to the Apostle Paul
[1:22:59] in a light
[1:23:02] they blinded him
[1:23:05] and knocked him to the ground
[1:23:07] amen amen
[1:23:15] why do you persecute me
[1:23:20] it's hard
[1:23:22] to kick against the thorn
[1:23:25] amen amen
[1:23:29] if the musicians can come forward
[1:23:33] if they can please come forward
[1:23:38] if you can understand we're going to be
[1:23:40] praying
[1:23:42] let us give thanks to God
[1:23:44] for his word
[1:23:52] is
[1:23:56] what we brought this evening is just a
[1:23:58] part of the testimony
