eternally won't it be amazing [Music] [Music] god bless you this morning [Music] and how he said how he's walked out those doors and it's like a wave that um that that atmosphere strikes him when you create that atmosphere here in the sanctuary atmosphere so we want to grab hold of his presence in his spirit this morning and let him speak to us just a few simple words today if you be so kind just open your bibles and meet in ephesians chapter four foreign we want to thank our pastor and the ministry for the opportunity to be here the trust and confidence to speak a few words to you all once again [Music] may it be the lord speaking this morning not the man ephesians 4 30 reads and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption let's bow our heads this morning and lord give us some of that grace by your word today heal any heart in the audience healing lord necessity give the holy spirit to any soul that needs that holy spirit this morning and just take us on that ride and get us ready for that rapture that is coming soon preparing as the world is continuously entering into turmoil and we see our brothers and sisters on the other side of the world crying out to you for help we know that one day the same will happen to this nation but while we still have the opportunity to give you thanks in the blessing of having a sanctuary for me we want to thank you this morning for this opportunity may you have preeminence in the service and just speak to us a few sweet words this morning we put it all in your precious hands we put your sons and daughters in your hands this morning amen amen you may be seated forgive me for getting so emotional all the time i don't want to be like that no no but i i'm going to say it's your fault you always do this but god is good amen amen i i would like to give a little title to this small talk this morning and title it uh rapture express and let us if you still have your bibles open turn to hebrews chapter 10. and if you go all the way down to the end verse 38 and verse 39. now the just shall live by faith us we are not of them who draw back onto perdition we're not of them who's going to turn our back and go to sin nosotros that are going to backslide and go in reverse but be of them that believe to the saving of the souls we have believers here this morning we're going to need believers this morning for where we're going this morning now i see a lot of people here that have tasted in one way or another of the presence of god personal they've been in the presence of god's glory at some point in their life felt his touch they've partaken of the grace that he gives and now our younger children the younger generation they're gonna these young sisters from my generation they're out their haircut and makeup on some of them the young brothers out in the club out in the bars cantina some are living a pretty good life with their high paying career and their good lifestyle and and some have even gotten to the point to call this message a lie yeah these brothers and sisters that we love but i think something had to have happened along the way something that hit them that hurt them that damaged them many times it's something that we see or something that we hear that that caused them to take this very same word the same word that saved them that brought them to their knees took them to the waters of baptism and for them to count it at one point in their life worthy of by the lifestyle the way they're living today they're counting this is unworthy like it was just an emotion or a sensation it's unworthy comoxinomas i don't know maybe they found out our prophet wasn't perfect maybe they said oops i just found out the pastor's not perfect the minister's well you know what it's better you might as well go out you come back next sunday proximo domingo when you're ready to hear jesus not the man where he can be the one that can speak to you this morning i don't want to be mean but let's read from the message be not afraid uh paragraph 51 and it says that's all it needs not so man to say well glory to god brother so-and-so laid hands on me i felt something go right through me you might have felt his hands laying his hands on you did you feel it i've known that i felt some strange feelings but i never did rest my faith upon that feeling i've got to build it upon okay thus saith the lord by the word of god not upon a sensation not upon a feeling my flesh is driven by sensations and my flesh is imperfect so so if you want to cast some stones at me today you can go ahead i really don't care about this flesh because this body to me it's no good this is from this corrupted soil of this earth it's been hybrid it does me no good there's a body that i'm waiting for and i used to work out on the railroad he says you anticipate and we would load in a boxcar these different things different but the inspector comes around first and it's got to it and it's got to go over a lot of rough roads that train is going to go downhill sometimes that train sometimes is going to go on windy roads sometimes on these rough bumpy roads and he says if there's anything loose he will not seal it if there's something moving around in that box car the inspector will not seal it shut he says until that car is loaded and compact till nothing can shake it says sanctification into the new birth of justification where there ain't no wind of doctrine that's going to shake you left or right there's no strange voice that's going to shake that box car in your life because you know what you're tied down to a question you know what's locked inside of your boxcar muster and that's the unadulterated word of the lord brother branham says then he closes the door and he seals it and it cannot be broken until it's at its destination i want you to keep that in mind until it's at the destination what is that destination god's got to give the approval he's got to check your boxcar and inspect it thoroughly not like like i'll just say like i've been uh when i used to work when i was young and i used to sell shoes and i'd have to check the the back room where all the shoes were uh and the shipments of shoes would come in these big old boxes and i had to check them off to make sure they were there but i would just open it up and two threes oh okay they're okay it's good no this inspector no is the inspector the lord jesus christ himself he's going to take measurements of that boxcar he's going to check every corner in that box and he's going to make sure it's nice and secure before he can put that seal and send it off to its destination says in the message the resurrection this is god comes around and finds a lot of foolishness in us he didn't say foolishness in me in him but in us [Music] truth you'll ever find in your life you might believe god's holy word this morning with the full but when we've once got packed in god's spirit the right way and you become a child of god then the door is closed and the seals put on that door and that door cannot be open until the destination once you're sealed he put that seal on himself so that seal is good till you get to the destination he says that works destined to be we're sealed by the holy ghost until the day of our redemption is that not the scripture that we read until the day of our redemption but your box car but my box car amiibo one it doesn't depend on the box car in front of me of the boxcar behind me no depending on you know i got caught in glendale the other day uh when we were going to take care of some matters from my grandmother's funeral es almost and we got caught behind the tree or we got caught at the train tracks and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of boxcars kept passing by one link to the other uno but they're not dependent upon one another to go forward you know there's somebody there doing something at the front of the training there's an evangelist pushing the buttons of that train there's a pastor watching the tracks of that train there's a teacher in communication with the stations for that training there's a fivefold ministry working to get that train to the rapture that ministry doing its job to get us to our destinations there's a conductor there's an engineer there's an operator that has to move that train conductor but without an engine in that train it's like the worst is the blind leading the blinds if the train don't got an engine i don't care what conductor and engineer and operator you've got no important conductor it's that holy spirit that seals us it's that holy spirit that pulls us and it's that holy spirit that's going to take us into the rapture yes no i i was thinking of the prodigal son uh yo pence prodigal and it might be a little different different but i thought of the father the king and and the prodigal son that went off in the world and i see prodigal sons and daughters here this morning and you know when he was on his way back and and the father the king daddy the king he was so happy and emotional he started giving orders episodes and he wasn't giving orders to just anybody to to to primo and theo and nico and to cousin uncle son daughter no no no he started giving orders to the servants that fivefold ministry are servants of god that are here to serve the sons and daughters of and god king that father said hey hey servant go kill that cow es padres oh jose is coming back he told the other servant hey go get the royal garments and prepare the feast because my son and daughter are coming back he was giving orders to that fivefold ministry for his sons and daughters because their and this word found you worthy yes therefore you're worthy of the finest god has to offer entonces you know you can't even be linked onto that train uh unless you've been inspected unless you've been approved for a problem you've been sealed by god because we kept saying that it's got a destination and there's only one destination for this train that's to the rapture that's to that eternal security that's and it's not going to take a single box car with it i don't know what train you're going to leave on this morning this ministry that ministry the other ministry because i gave up my name i gave up my nature i gave up my rights for his rights i was hearing a small uh uh and i'm assuming he's talking to the congregation he says what's my name and he says religion garcia garcia and then he says no listen says you and he starts expressing the person gets caught with their hand in the cookie jar and like they did something they got caught when your hand's in the cookie jar and brother bernie says and the person covers themselves with religion he says in other words they cover themselves with bernabeu garcia garcia told me to do this and told me to do that brother bernie says if that person is wise or prudent they would know that brother bernabeu garcia so when i heard these words they impacted me and you know we all make mistakes the pastor told me to do this so you know i i i did this and el paso is the preacher approached me and told me it's better if i do this and the sister advised me to do this and the brother said this the church said do this so that's why i do that the word says let every man's word be alive but mine be true and so i went on a trip when he was led by the spirit to be to be tested i took notice that satan spoke the word me i hope i don't sound crazy today but satan got a little bit smarter than how he was with eve in the beginning you know in the beginning he quoted the word in the principle but he twisted the word added to the word when he was back then with eve before the presence of the son of god he was a little more slick but still a coward because he had to approach him in a time of weakness when he was fasting but he was smart he was slick yeah and he quoted the word exactly as it's written but so the word says try the spirits to see if they are of god and the word also says to worship me in spirit and in truth now the spirit in satan satan he first came to jesus and challenged him then he came and quoted psalms 91 word for word to him and it didn't work so then he tempted him he spoke the word and he spoke just the truth but from the beginning he's always had the wrong spirit but jesus replied with the right spirit and the truth and when you come to service you that's here this morning anyone watching online this morning you just simply being here that's only half the job you know you come and you write down the quote you bring out your notepad and you write down the scriptures and you you you hear a word that strikes you you said oh you know impact so you write it down but then you hear a word that sounds uncertain you also write that down and cross check it with the words to make sure that it was in spirit and in truth foreign amen to the message service after service after service is obedience to the words can we say that this morning obedience to the word obedience we've all made mistakes that's why we're here to ask for forgiveness to confess our sins so let them know our lord i did do wrong can you forgive me and make me white as snow again but brother and sister we're already under the blood but we got that conviction to ask for forgiveness not only to the lord no mental senor but to our brother maybe you covered yourself in religion maybe you've covered yourself in johnny alvarado religion alvarado jose branham maybe it's your first time here today he says church and if we're not careful we'll get caught up in the message church religion there's no religion that's going to seal that boxcar no he's the one that will steal your railcar your boxcar and and just think about this you know we've got preachers the church has preachers domination message all any christian church has preachers denominations and a preacher is preaching because he's got the gift of preaching he don't even need to have an experience to have the gift of preaching experience and rappers and political figures and activists people that are really good preachers they can attract the masses and we've got some of those preachers in the church as well and unfortunately some of those preachers don't even have the holy ghost but they know how to preach the gift to preach it's there whether you're saved or not god don't give you the gift of being a witness you've got to become a witness what god needs in his church what god needs in here today is witnesses witnesses true and faithful witnesses a church with people in it a church with members in it bench warmers that can be real witnesses because they've come in contact with the living god they've heard a voice one day they believed in a sign one day those are real witnesses those are those that can say amen to the words as i was talking to brother manuel in the back and i was explaining a little bit about the message he was telling me he's a brother hermano i preached the same thing on friday i said praise god then i don't feel that bad this morning because we're not just the preachers standing up here when we look at real faithful witnesses in the audience you're preaching back to the ministers but it says if the shoe fits is uh you know if the shoe fits i'm sorry it's not a bad thing no salgo but if the shoe fits what you going to do about it so remember i ring back to what brother eli preached a long time ago how condemnation is not forgive me condemnation is for the world not for the believers not for the sake but correction is for the believer correction is for the same but because i'm still in this flesh that you can cast stones i need a little bit of correction well you know my home it's so hard for me to keep it in line well if the shoe fits you know i try to keep my kids in line and i thought i was bringing them to church and that's enough if the shoe fits you know my attitude that brother he makes me so mad and i try to be nice to him well if the shoe fits lord give me the correction that i need correction and we all we all read our bibles in here and and since we read our bibles the word says that love is condemning love is get inspired and have to preach these rough things and to all the brothers and sisters watching online even myself from the living room back in san diego party ayanna san diego sometimes he would say a couple of things that i just had it was just uncomfortable for me it wasn't like a little small prison knife but it was like a greek sword from back there that goes in and out and it's because of what the preacher is saying why does he gotta you know maybe you're saying on the inside can you just give the preacher the love that i need so that i can i can change my life lord can you just give the pastor the love that i need to hear so i can i can understand this word give so correction comes with the little bit of whooping cough does it come with a little bit of whooping vienne i was whooped from phoenix to san diego the phoenix san diego medal some sundays i'm whooped in here but i'm not the one doing the whooping coil the the pastor is not the one doing the whoopings the teacher evangelist whoever is not doing the whooping it's daddy that does the whoopings that he took a beating so far not not moses that our brothers preached to us who killed the egyptians but a different brother he was so jealous and passionate of the revelation that he carries this conviction that burned inside is the conviction that he started off with the little beating okay but he ended up killing his brother with this tongue unfortunately we have killed one another but we need to be very careful because it's so easy to kill and condemn your brother and sister came through him day in and day out as a brother i don't want to be king to you and i hope you don't want to be kane to your brother's sister i know of another brother hermano and he and his brother they shared the same father we shared the same father right they heard the same word they sat in the same church and that brother's name was jacob and the promise the birthright gift but jacob knew that his brother didn't care for that birthright he didn't care for the holy ghost he didn't care for his salvation we're not waiting for the last family to get in no estamos espresso ultima family we're waiting for the last individual to come in that means it's an individual affair with god and if i've got to be like a brother in the bible maybe it sounds bad but matthew chapter 10 says jesus was speaking and he gives a warning ye wise as serpents but harmless as doves so maybe it's time this morning to take on the garment of the scriptures to put on the character of our brother of our brother jacob no brother hermano i i watch how you've been and how you act i'm kind of like you sorry you know i'm one foot in and one foot out you know but if you don't want the new birth but i've been waiting in line and if you don't want salvation well get out the way because i'm gonna claim it you don't want the token this morning somebody that's met the person of the holy ghost someone that knows him someone has felt him let's talk to him somebody that can say man because he changed my life that is the amen of the faithful witness behold i send you the prophet elijah amen amen unless a man is born again he cannot see the kingdom amen i'm in i must go yo but i will send you the comforter that he may be with you and even in you the church needs witnesses you close your eyes men and women that can say amen because they are the faithful witness you know the song amazing grace sublime gracias how sweet the sound del senor that saved a wretch like me through many dangers through so many dangers oils and snares i have already come today [Music] disgrace has brought me safe thus far and that grace will lead me
