like i like always como siempre always like to thank our pastor my brother johnny alvarado juanito alvarado for the opportunity and privilege that he allows us to stand behind his puppet privilege amen i don't want to take too much time but i'd like to go to the scripture quietly amen i know it's kind of odd to say to stand uh imagine being in your living room or in your room but we're so accustomed to stand for the reverence of the word so you may forgive me amen this is so new 1833 saint john san juan then pilate entered into the judgment hall again and called jesus and said unto him art thou the king of the jews jesus answered him say sayest thou this thing of thyself or did others tell thee of me jesus pilate answered am i a jew thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what hast thou done villa responds to jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hence respond pilate therefore said unto him are thou a king then jesus answered thou sayest that i am a king to this end was i born and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness onto the truth every one that is of the truth heareth my voice is pilate saith unto him what is the truth and when he had said this he went out again on to the jews and said unto them i find him no fault one at the passover were you therefore that i release onto the king of the jews then cried they all again saying not this man but barabbas now barabbas was a robber entonces amen you may take your seats may god bless the reading of his word like uh once again we'd like to thank the lord for the life and the opportunity of being here uh we've been i've been having a thought in my mind and we've been speaking a bit on the kingdom and i haven't really left that subject so maybe if the lord sees it fine or sees it good but i like to entitle it where is the kingdom located and i have a subtitle that i got from john 18 34. that's where i got my subtitles and my subtitle i like to entitle it is do you know jesus christ i'd like to focus that on a little bit to ask you a question do you know jesus christ it's like if i were to say it do you know brother so-and-so i know who he is i know he looks like this but i never really had a conversation with him i don't really know him and sometimes i guess we get that confused a lot and we think we know jesus christ because we go to church because we've been going since we were we were little children because my grandma knows jesus christ because so and so or my family or my family member knows the lord we use that as i guess like a reference point we say well i don't know him but my dad does do you know jesus christ so i've noticed that uh that's why pilate pilato he said are you the king of the jews it is that's amazing what a bloody face naked scars all over his back because you got to notice the scene that we're talking about here said are you the king of the jews are you saying this because you know it or because you heard it from someone else that's the same question that he asked peter pedro what do the people say the son of man what do they say some say that you're one of the prophets no no but do you know jesus christ what did you say and peter said thou art the star of the son of the living god then jesus said jesus contest so my question to you is do you know jesus christ do you know him now when you know someone says you can approach him freely us when it's the uh young people to the adults or the excuse me let me rephrase this let me fix this when it's the young people asking the grandparents to say grandma or dad or mom abuela mama papa can you pray for me for me i've even had some adults you can't sit again i even had some adults elderly people uh personas mayors come to me which i'm a lot younger and they say can you pray for me for me and my question comes that's my question do you know jesus christ when you know a certain brother i'm not going to say brother emmanuel can you ask brother johnny this for me november but the question is why am i not going to brother johnny myself do you know jesus christ that's why in romans 5 1 romano can come on to jesus we can come unto god freely so that's that's why with through what jesus christ did paying for our sins dying on the cross now we have peace with him now we can approach him we had i guess you can say a broken fellowship with god whatever happened in the beginning with in the garden of eden we were cast out now we have peace with god so now we can come on to him and get to know him that's why we're so scared to come to god that's why some adults some elders say can you pray for me because they don't know god or the young people go on to the elders and say can you pray and lord i it strikes me when jesus asked pilate jesus you're saying this because of yourself though this is portimismo or because you heard it from someone else amen amen if we can go to matthew matteo matthew 4 matteo cuatro we find that here jesus encontra jesus was there in the desert in the wilderness he fasted for 40 days 40 nights and we noticed that the temp the the tempter came to him if thou be the son of god command these stones to be made bread is trying to figure out this being jesus and he was so similar to like any man i can see the devil starting following jesus since his birth and maybe perhaps the devil was doubting because that's where he sent for the first those kids to be born at that time and he wasn't so sure that a god a king where the cows and he didn't understand maybe this is myself speaking you could throw this away opinion alone but that every word that proceeded out of the mouth of god that's a good subject one day maybe we can speak about the mouth of god and took him to the very top of the temple and he said if if that'll be the son of god throw yourself cast thyself down imagine jesus being the top of the holy in the top of the temple in the party so he's noticed that jesus didn't didn't didn't uh listen to him the first time so now he's trying him a second time then satan says he shall give angels charge concerning thee and their hand shall bear thee up los angeles they're not they are they're not going to allow for anything to happen so he was waiting for jesus to do this so he's it is written again it is [Music] all these things will i give thee todd thou shall worship the lord thy god and him only shall thou serve now i want to i want to pause a little bit you might say well the devil doesn't stop us that even the devil said it is written now you got to be careful jesus they are being tempted in the desert jesus maybe it's a good thing that the devil is here which you know you grab a it's like a two wheels and uh you put something heavy in it and you recline it so it helps you move heavy things upon diablo whoever that mexican whoever it was they called that the devil was truly inspired real men because that thing is oh hallelujah don't you understand what i'm talking about you you put the dolly push it in there you slide it in there you push it back and who's doing all the work the devil see the devil was created for a purpose he said he showed all the kingdoms he should all the kingdoms in all of its glory that all of this belongs to him in the future 17 bcc now this will be i guess my base scripture jesus and then he was demanded of the pharisees when the kingdom of god shall come and he answered them and said the kingdom of god cometh not with observations 21st neither shall they say lo here although there for behold the kingdom of god is within you is the kingdom located in dondes encuentro reno when the pharisees were demanding him they were pressuring him when the kingdom was going to come cuando escaped he said he says it's not going to be here nor there oh yeah forbid the kingdom of god is within you we spoke about first seeking the kingdom now we're talking about where the kingdom of god is located in jesus here is telling the pharisees yeah now there is where the kingdom of god is at ies amen i'm going to read a little script a little quote here uh give me your little patience here brother brahm says do you said if my kingdom was of this world i could call any legions of angels but my kingdom is not of this world so therefore legions and powers that's why that's why uh jesus said jesus in uh saint john 18 and juan di this is my kingdom it's out of here you say no no if it was here i was saying for the angels to help me yo mandaria he said it is within you the kingdom of god is not in this world but it is within you el reyno de dios no estan esta mundo so all of those angels that were to protect jesus is now within you so all those legions and powers do oh you notice that brother branham is saying that how that prodigal son he was in the kingdom he wanted his inheritance now he left with his inheritance and that is how that prodigal sound son found himself he says but you don't want us to be your servants no it says but you don't want us to be your servants you want us to be your sons and daughters and we go astray and we leave the presence of the lord you want us to be you want us to be your sons and daughters and that's a very awesome thing that's why the question is do you know jesus christ do you know who he is know that he loves you many of us don't know that a lot of us because [Music] we know that the kingdom is within us but that's why he says behold i stand at the door and knock. now if you notice it's his kingdom is permission just like it is with the united states and russia it's a cold war do you say because your dad knows that jesus that is not just asking that's why they wanted to crucify him not because he lied no not because he robbed that because he adultered because there he was just a man he was a man that was trying to raise himself up they know and then they cried out for the blood of jesus christ because it had to be done because in order for god to be within you el petrorio the judgment hall i remember i s that's a good thing what did they do with the judgment what did they do to him kelly sierra they stripped them naked they put it they put a a a blindfold over his eyes and then they began to whip him and they began to say who punched you you're a prophet tell us who punched you dinos he was being judged now by who truly was he being judged he knew that it had to be done now barabbas was a robber he was a thief now what are we nosotros brother branham said this branham that went i liked this story very much he said that barabbas was waiting and he said he was pacing back and forth back and forth because he knew that the crucifixion crucifixion is a very torturing thing and finally he began to heard hear the roman soldiers with their chains marching down the cell finally and take them and he began to hear the the footsteps of the romans the chains being dragged by the floor como esque las cadenas for el pisco the right call would be him to be crucified and i will reign upon he did not touch the earth because he is holy porque les santos but when he comes back he's going to set foot on the earth [Music] dear lord heavenly father lord i lord i want to get to know you
