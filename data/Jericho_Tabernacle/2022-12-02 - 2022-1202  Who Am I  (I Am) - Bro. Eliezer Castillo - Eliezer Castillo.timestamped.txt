[29:12] Hallelujah
[29:16] [Music]
[29:36] praise God
[29:39] whenever I lift up my hands
[29:42] I heard our brother Pedro mancilla
[29:47] he was praying and he was quoting
[29:49] brother Branham
[29:52] how when we lift up our hands we defy
[29:55] gravity
[29:59] or Define everything that tells us to
[30:02] leave our hands down
[30:06] and whenever we do it we surrender to
[30:09] the almighty God
[30:11] when we do it God sees
[30:15] whether we're here in church or whether
[30:17] we're at our house alone
[30:22] whenever I raise my hands God knows
[30:27] and when he knows he takes away my car
[30:30] my charges
[30:33] he takes everything away
[30:35] I'm so thankful for that song Amen
[30:40] so good to be here in the house of the
[30:42] Lord once more
[30:45] to give God all the honor and the glory
[30:49] I pray that each and every one of you
[30:51] came with a liquifier and with
[30:53] expectations
[30:58] we believe that God is here this evening
[31:01] or amen
[31:03] hey man I want to go straight to the
[31:06] scriptures
[31:08] if you would like to turn with me to
[31:10] Matthew 3 16.
[31:16] now we're going to read 16 and 17.
[31:19] this is
[31:25] whenever you have it just go ahead and
[31:27] say Amen
[31:31] and the Bible says
[31:34] and Jesus when he was baptized went
[31:38] straight away out of the water Lo the
[31:40] heavens were open unto him and he saw
[31:43] the spirit of God descending like a dove
[31:46] and lighting upon Him
[31:52] foreign
[32:02] this is my beloved Son in whom I am well
[32:05] pleased
[32:12] brother Berlin says in other words in
[32:15] whom I am well pleased to dwell in
[32:18] Andres
[32:21] amen it was such a blessing to see our
[32:24] sister Lydia get baptized
[32:28] because that's what happens
[32:31] when we're baptized when we give our
[32:34] hearts to the Lord
[32:37] God identifies you dioses as a child of
[32:42] God
[32:43] well let's let's turn to chapter four
[32:48] chapter four one two three
[32:53] now this is right when Jesus tells him
[32:57] or this is when God identifies Jesus
[33:04] this is my beloved Son
[33:08] now in chapter 4 it says then Jesus was
[33:11] led of the spirit Into the Wilderness to
[33:14] be tempted of the devil
[33:16] Jesus
[33:20] and when he had fasted 40 days and 40
[33:24] nights he was afterward and hungered
[33:31] and when the tempter came to him he said
[33:34] if thou be the Son of God command these
[33:38] stones to be made bread
[33:45] let us
[33:49] heavenly father father Celestial Lord
[33:52] we're so thankful you've allowed us to
[33:54] be here this evening Lord
[33:58] father I ask that you just take
[34:00] preeminence of each and every one of us
[34:02] here
[34:06] Lord that if there's anything you would
[34:09] like to say that you may have free
[34:11] Reigns to speak to us this evening
[34:13] fathers
[34:19] Lord we submit ourselves unto thee and
[34:22] we we come with Open Hearts and open
[34:24] ears
[34:28] we thank you we give you the glory
[34:32] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[34:37] amen you may be seated
[34:40] so as you could see up there in the the
[34:45] screens
[34:47] my title is who am I
[34:52] that's a very good question to ask
[34:54] ourselves
[34:58] I believe it's one of the greatest
[35:00] issues that people are wrestling with
[35:06] who am I
[35:08] the greatest Quest that people can
[35:10] Embark in is the discovery of oneself
[35:18] young people that's what they try to do
[35:21] discover who they are yes
[35:26] and if everything goes right they they
[35:29] figure out who they are is
[35:34] but even over time it seems like people
[35:38] try to find out who they are what's
[35:41] their meaning in life
[35:48] identity is is the fact of being who a
[35:52] person is
[35:56] to understand identity
[36:00] identity is often thought as your
[36:04] overarching sense of your view of
[36:07] yourself so
[36:13] [Music]
[36:16] you know the the young people today
[36:20] and not only the young people but I
[36:23] believe the old some of the old also
[36:27] some of the adults
[36:31] they're figuring out trying to figure
[36:33] out who they are
[36:37] and the way they try to figure out is
[36:40] they try to fit in with certain things
[36:46] they're trying to figure out what what
[36:49] career they're going to make
[36:54] what school to go to
[36:57] Escuela who to marry
[37:00] what what what profession should I
[37:03] embark in uh
[37:07] who am I what defines
[37:12] that's a very good question
[37:15] a stable uh sense of identity
[37:21] it means that you know who you are
[37:27] that you're the same person from the
[37:29] past
[37:31] as you are from the prayer to the
[37:34] present all the way to the future
[37:39] a stable sense of identity
[37:44] is that you can identify who you are
[37:49] even though sometimes your actions are
[37:52] contrary to that
[37:57] sometimes we do something out of
[37:59] character
[38:02] out of our own identity
[38:06] but when you know who you are
[38:10] it doesn't matter rain or shine good or
[38:13] bad days
[38:18] you know who you are
[38:24] and that's the search that the whole
[38:26] world has today yes
[38:31] what I realized as in studying this
[38:36] that your identity is made up of layers
[38:39] that are added up throughout your life
[38:40] is
[38:51] your perception of your abilities
[38:55] they're formed by your achievements
[39:00] by the way of your your behaving
[39:04] even as that changes
[39:08] your personality or your
[39:13] temperamento your opinions or your the
[39:17] social roles that you play
[39:21] such as work school even Church
[39:27] those are all layers of our what makes
[39:30] up our personality or our identity
[39:36] so why why is knowing or why is our
[39:40] identity so important
[39:46] why is it important to know who we are
[39:49] important because your identity
[39:53] it governs the kind of life that you're
[39:56] going to live
[39:58] it propels you to a certain destination
[40:04] by your own identity who you identify
[40:07] with
[40:11] now I mentioned some layers of how how
[40:14] your achievements or how your work can
[40:16] can be a layer of your identity
[40:22] but we we need to find out
[40:26] all of us we need to find out
[40:30] the the core or the your strong or your
[40:34] core identity so nuclear nucleos
[40:38] your core identity that that will stay
[40:41] the same and will adapt to all the
[40:44] changes
[40:50] that no matter what happens you are this
[40:56] because we can't we can't make a thing
[40:59] our identity
[41:03] we can't make our job our core identity
[41:10] hey who are you
[41:12] oh I'm a barber oh I'm an insurance
[41:16] agent
[41:20] and we make that our identity
[41:25] well that's a layer of our identity
[41:29] but we can make our jobs
[41:33] we can't make our relationships
[41:36] we can't even make the way we look our
[41:40] identity
[41:45] because those things
[41:48] those things become very unstable
[41:53] established if if a young woman makes
[41:55] her looks her identities
[42:02] look at the social media
[42:05] look at how how they identify themselves
[42:08] by the way they look
[42:13] everything they do is surrounded by that
[42:16] okay
[42:20] but what happens when she turns 80 years
[42:22] old
[42:25] what happens when when her her looks
[42:30] fade away
[42:32] her identity crashes down
[42:37] what if your job what if you get laid
[42:40] off
[42:41] your identity is broken in pieces
[42:46] if you identify yourself through
[42:49] relationships what if those broke break
[42:52] or what if those are broken
[42:57] so we have to identify ourselves
[43:03] with something that is going to hold us
[43:06] forever
[43:09] something that is not going to change
[43:12] with the times
[43:13] [Music]
[43:15] he even achieved people receive their
[43:19] identity by achieving things
[43:25] well I'm the best at my work
[43:28] well I'm this and I've been top of my
[43:31] class
[43:33] well I am the most good-looking
[43:38] oh well I'm the smartest one
[43:42] and we become we attach our identity by
[43:46] our achievements
[43:51] but what what if some we find somebody
[43:53] that's better than us
[43:56] somebody that does it better
[43:59] somebody that is smarter
[44:02] somebody that is more better looking
[44:06] than our identity becomes unstable
[44:09] identity
[44:11] well the whole world is constantly
[44:15] changing
[44:18] if you have a strong sense of who you
[44:21] are
[44:24] you have an anchor
[44:26] you have an anchor so that you can stand
[44:29] the time the test of times
[44:33] because without in that anchor
[44:37] changes will become chaotic in your life
[44:43] changes will become terrifying in your
[44:46] life
[44:49] because you don't have
[44:54] who am I that's what I want the young
[44:57] people to think who are who am I
[45:00] okay
[45:02] when I'm in school who am I
[45:05] when I'm with all my co-workers who am I
[45:10] we're not away from church when I'm away
[45:12] from my parents who am I
[45:17] when I'm by myself who am I
[45:23] it's a good question to ask
[45:27] a lot of us
[45:29] when we were younger a lot of us
[45:33] have a lot of hat to wear
[45:37] we have a lot of personas
[45:40] that's natural yes we try we try to fit
[45:45] in
[45:46] we we try to change the way we look in
[45:50] order to fit in with other people
[45:55] we try to act a certain way so that we
[45:58] can fit in with a certain group of
[46:00] people
[46:06] and we have a lot of faces
[46:09] that's normal yes that's normal as a
[46:13] young person
[46:15] to try to fit in with the group
[46:20] my brother Branham says what makes them
[46:23] do that
[46:26] it's it's for a cause
[46:29] now now um I pray praise God for uh the
[46:34] way God does things
[46:38] because I've been it's been in my heart
[46:41] for for a while
[46:45] and then this Sunday our precious
[46:47] brother Juanito is
[46:50] preach the message message identified
[46:53] with Christ
[46:57] and and uh he used this this message
[47:01] identified with Christ
[47:05] and this is the um part of part of the
[47:08] message
[47:10] he says it's foreign
[47:16] God gave gave them that nature
[47:21] they've got a nature that makes them
[47:23] want to have something to identify
[47:26] themselves with
[47:31] so it's a god-given nature
[47:35] to identify ourselves with something
[47:38] someone foreign
[48:00] they want to be a superstar
[48:04] they they see these the the new people
[48:08] that that these new influencers
[48:14] they see these great people behind the
[48:18] screen
[48:22] and what happens is it puts a pressure
[48:25] on our young people
[48:30] to become who they are
[48:34] to become like the world
[48:37] because once they step out of their
[48:39] homes
[48:41] they're homes that have been prayed over
[48:45] the homes that play the tapes
[48:50] once they go out and they go into the
[48:53] real world
[48:56] when they go into their schools
[49:00] see is the influence of of what you see
[49:04] behind the screens
[49:09] all you see is the influence of
[49:12] Tick Tock
[49:15] and Instagram Instagram YouTube the
[49:19] YouTube uh I don't know the rest
[49:23] TV television Netflix either Netflix
[49:27] it's all there
[49:29] it's something that we all know
[49:33] young or old we know the influences out
[49:36] there
[49:40] and and what happens is young people are
[49:44] trying to fit in
[49:49] they're trying to find who they are
[49:53] so they have to identify themselves with
[49:57] something identification
[50:02] so they they move here and they change
[50:04] here and they wear many hats
[50:10] I remember when I was a young man
[50:14] I was under 18.
[50:17] Church Iglesia I was the same and like
[50:22] let's say
[50:24] I was the Saint at church
[50:26] I had to fit in I had to then
[50:30] but put me with my friends
[50:33] Amigos put me with my buddies Amigos
[50:38] and I I become somebody completely
[50:40] different
[50:44] I become different it's natural
[50:48] that's the cause of sin Isa is
[50:52] born in sins shaped in iniquity come to
[50:55] this world-speaking life
[51:00] without an experience
[51:03] I would act just like them maybe worse
[51:09] the bad thing about where I live
[51:14] it was a small town
[51:17] people knew who my pastor was
[51:21] and they knew he was my uncle
[51:25] and so when I would be in middle school
[51:29] and I'd be saying those words
[51:33] the other
[51:35] students
[51:37] not the teachers not not the counselors
[51:42] the other students Los otros estudiantes
[51:45] would say why are you acting that way
[51:49] that's not who you are
[51:53] that's not how you were raised no voice
[51:56] why I was trying to fit in there
[52:01] was a man that was married to his wife
[52:07] and he said this statement that really
[52:09] caught my attention
[52:13] he says my wife has been married to five
[52:16] different men
[52:20] over all the years that we've been
[52:23] married
[52:26] and he said all those men were mean
[52:32] his character and his identity would
[52:35] change
[52:40] I I can ask each and every person that
[52:43] that is um you know adults
[52:47] think of yourself when you were 15 years
[52:50] old
[52:57] oh man
[52:59] he didn't know nothing
[53:01] even when he was 20 years old 20 year
[53:05] old Eli was ignorant he didn't know
[53:07] anything
[53:10] he was a different persona but as As I
[53:16] Grew I changed my identity
[53:20] As I Grew I became more mature
[53:26] into the identity of Christ
[53:30] as I change in my life
[53:34] that old person he's different he's
[53:37] another person is
[53:46] he smoked cigarettes
[53:50] oh it didn't matter if there was one on
[53:53] the floor he would get the little bud
[53:55] and he would smoke
[54:00] that's who he was
[54:04] until something happened in him
[54:08] and whenever he gave his heart to the
[54:10] Lord
[54:12] his identity changed
[54:15] that wasn't him anymore
[54:18] so when people say oh well Juanito he
[54:21] was he's him he's that person
[54:26] you can't put him to that person anymore
[54:30] his identity changed
[54:34] Who Am I
[54:36] who are you today
[54:40] looking inside of our emotions and our
[54:42] feelings
[54:46] and our desires to find our identity
[54:51] it will not work
[54:54] because like I said we change every year
[54:59] we change every week
[55:02] young people we change with the culture
[55:08] if we're not serving the lord we're
[55:10] changing
[55:13] last year they used to wear those pants
[55:15] not this year
[55:20] last year's how they used to cut their
[55:22] hair that's how they used to cut their
[55:23] hair last year
[55:27] oh you're still growing your beard that
[55:29] was that was 2015.
[55:34] oh you're still you still have this
[55:37] style like that oh that was 10 years ago
[55:42] it changes every day
[55:46] now these days
[55:49] we are people
[55:51] demanding
[55:54] demanding for everyone else
[55:58] to identify themselves or identify them
[56:02] by their gender identity or their
[56:04] pronounselves
[56:12] this is this is made up of a sense of
[56:16] themselves or this made up sense of
[56:19] themselves
[56:23] it's based on the time that they live in
[56:25] is
[56:28] by by the place that they're at
[56:32] and by the way they feel is
[56:38] so so one day
[56:43] what is it a she her or her she uh
[56:49] and the next day they're he him or they
[56:52] them
[56:57] it changes by their feelings
[57:01] the thing is now this is what's going on
[57:04] in in schools today
[57:07] this is what's going on in that the
[57:11] young people have to deal with today
[57:17] what is brother he like talking about
[57:19] the young people know
[57:22] that that that these people
[57:26] they demand you
[57:29] to call them by their identity
[57:32] but their identity is so fickle or so
[57:36] unstable
[57:38] that they could be a she one day okay
[57:44] and non-binary the next day
[57:51] or or he him or they them
[57:54] and they change it
[57:57] yet they demand you to call them by
[58:00] their identity
[58:03] there was only one one person
[58:08] that could say I am okay
[58:12] that was gone
[58:14] Moses said who are you
[58:17] he said I am the I am
[58:22] if I want to be the door I'm the door
[58:27] I am the shepherd
[58:30] I am the Water of Life
[58:36] Today people want to be I am
[58:40] I am this now
[58:42] tomorrow I'll be this
[58:45] that's the world we're living in today
[58:48] that's
[58:50] the world that our young people have to
[58:53] indulge themselves in this is
[58:59] the world thinks today
[59:02] that they're able to create their own
[59:05] identity
[59:08] but they don't realize
[59:11] that the culture has influenced the way
[59:15] they are
[59:16] influence
[59:18] now I'm bringing it as plain as possible
[59:22] we know who who's in control of the
[59:25] culture
[59:28] we know that the devil has his hands on
[59:30] it
[59:32] so when these people they try to
[59:35] identify themselves and say it's coming
[59:38] from me I am
[59:41] controllers
[59:44] it's the culture that they're being
[59:47] influenced by is
[59:50] now now imagine I want you guys to
[59:53] imagine something
[59:55] and time is going so fast
[1:00:00] imagine all right imagine
[1:00:02] 1200 years
[1:00:05] an Aztec warrior is walking around the
[1:00:08] Amazon jungle
[1:00:10] is
[1:00:14] and he has two very strong feelings
[1:00:19] now remember he's an Aztec warrior
[1:00:24] first he sees aggression inside of him
[1:00:29] he loves War
[1:00:32] he loves killing
[1:00:35] and he loves to hunt
[1:00:38] he sees that in him
[1:00:41] and he says that's me
[1:00:44] he says that's me
[1:00:47] I'm an Aztec warrior Jose I'm gonna
[1:00:51] Express that so
[1:00:54] then he sees another feeling
[1:01:00] now forgive me for for getting a little
[1:01:03] um
[1:01:03] too much but I just want you guys to
[1:01:06] understand what's going on here
[1:01:12] he sees another feeling
[1:01:15] he sees the same sex attraction
[1:01:30] he said that's not me
[1:01:33] now let's take somebody today
[1:01:38] a young hispanic man
[1:01:41] um
[1:01:42] let's say his ancestor was that Aztec
[1:01:45] warriors
[1:01:48] now you have this Hispanic man walking
[1:01:51] down downtown Phoenix
[1:01:55] the Phoenix he has two strong feelings
[1:01:59] he sees aggression
[1:02:03] he sees that he he likes to hurt people
[1:02:08] and he says I need therapy neces
[1:02:13] something's wrong with me I need to go
[1:02:15] to a therapist
[1:02:19] then he sees the other feelings
[1:02:32] now now why did I say those two things
[1:02:35] because
[1:02:39] it depends on the culture of what you're
[1:02:42] going to express
[1:02:47] 1200 years ago the culture was demanding
[1:02:53] it was demanding for a warrior Guerrero
[1:02:59] so so the other feeling he said that's
[1:03:02] not me
[1:03:06] and maybe he thought this expression or
[1:03:09] this self uh identity was coming from
[1:03:12] himself
[1:03:17] but this culture
[1:03:20] will bring out a blueprint or a grid of
[1:03:24] how we should be
[1:03:28] so now in this day
[1:03:31] they say oh you know what being
[1:03:34] masculine no no no that's that's not
[1:03:36] part of the culture anymore
[1:03:40] to be aggressive that's not me anymore
[1:03:45] that's not socially acceptable
[1:03:50] what's acceptable is is the same sex
[1:03:54] attraction
[1:03:57] and then they attach the
[1:04:03] they think they know what they're doing
[1:04:06] or they think it's coming from
[1:04:07] themselves but it's it's a tool of the
[1:04:10] enemy and yes
[1:04:14] it's culture telling you you have to be
[1:04:18] a certain way
[1:04:22] you have to act a certain way
[1:04:26] that's what culture is doing today to
[1:04:29] our young people
[1:04:33] but culture is unstable and it changes
[1:04:36] every day
[1:04:40] so young men young women
[1:04:44] by the way you are dressed
[1:04:47] by the way you believe foreign
[1:04:51] by the way you live
[1:04:56] the culture will identify you a certain
[1:04:58] way
[1:05:00] they will categorize you maybe crazy
[1:05:07] um
[1:05:13] it's easy to be a professing Christian
[1:05:16] it's uh
[1:05:19] and and let the culture tell you who you
[1:05:22] are or who you should be
[1:05:27] the culture will try to push you to what
[1:05:31] it really is
[1:05:35] they'll try to push you to be like
[1:05:37] everybody else in the world
[1:05:41] they'll try to identify you as
[1:05:43] old-fashioned
[1:05:46] they'll identify you as a certain class
[1:05:49] of people
[1:05:52] and try to make you be like them
[1:05:57] I understand this now all right
[1:06:00] that we need somebody to name us
[1:06:12] somebody identified me for for myself
[1:06:17] somebody identified me and said this is
[1:06:20] who you are
[1:06:23] so so we have to identify ourselves with
[1:06:27] something today
[1:06:32] identify is to recognize
[1:06:37] recognize something or somebody
[1:06:41] to prove that that person is who he is
[1:06:46] you know in the in the courts
[1:06:50] whenever you you have a victim uh
[1:06:54] and they need to find out who the
[1:06:57] suspect is
[1:07:00] they line up a group of people uh
[1:07:02] foreign
[1:07:34] now I wanted to get a subject but I
[1:07:36] won't do it I won't put anybody um
[1:07:39] make anybody embarrassed
[1:07:43] um
[1:07:44] so I'm going to ask everybody
[1:07:48] can you guys just do this one thing for
[1:07:50] me
[1:07:51] I want you guys to look at your face
[1:07:58] nobody no you need this right
[1:08:04] you can't look at your own face
[1:08:07] you need something to identify yourself
[1:08:11] you need
[1:08:14] to identify yourself with something
[1:08:17] identification there's many things we
[1:08:20] don't know about ourselves
[1:08:24] until we identify ourselves through
[1:08:27] something else
[1:08:31] and then we can see who we truly are yes
[1:08:35] almost
[1:08:38] amen amen
[1:08:40] did you know that Jesus went through the
[1:08:43] same thing you are going through today
[1:08:48] did you know he grew up the same way
[1:08:54] that the culture or the people
[1:08:58] identified him a certain way
[1:09:03] oh you're an illegitimate child
[1:09:07] right
[1:09:08] oh he's the son of the crazy woman
[1:09:12] oh she says that she would she had a
[1:09:15] virgin birth
[1:09:18] oh that's the crazy family
[1:09:22] oh that's that's him
[1:09:25] that's how the world identified Jesus
[1:09:28] Christ I see for 30 years
[1:09:34] for 30 years they identified him that
[1:09:36] way
[1:09:38] oh he's Joseph's son
[1:09:41] oh the the poor family that makes makes
[1:09:45] uh tables
[1:09:48] oh it's it's them
[1:09:51] oh it's her oh it's him
[1:09:55] oh that person oh it's a person and they
[1:09:58] put him in a little category category
[1:10:04] let's look at uh Matthew 3 16.
[1:10:10] what happened
[1:10:12] now this is the first time
[1:10:17] that God spoke to Jesus that we can see
[1:10:20] in the Bible okay
[1:10:25] Jesus he goes up to John the Baptist
[1:10:29] Jesus Bautista
[1:10:33] Jesus or John the Baptist just finished
[1:10:36] preaching
[1:10:38] saying that there was going to be one
[1:10:42] whose sandals he wasn't even worthy to
[1:10:45] unlock
[1:10:47] he was going to baptize them not with
[1:10:50] water only but by the spirit or by the
[1:10:53] the fire of the Holy ghosts
[1:10:59] now here comes this little stoop
[1:11:02] shouldered man
[1:11:05] the illegitimate child
[1:11:08] the the son of the crazy woman
[1:11:14] what is the world identifying you today
[1:11:19] you know you we have to be careful to
[1:11:23] not to accept what the world thinks of
[1:11:25] us
[1:11:30] he he was baptized
[1:11:33] right when he comes up
[1:11:37] right when he comes up
[1:11:40] the spirit of God comes down
[1:11:44] it says it comes down like a dove
[1:11:47] and foreign
[1:12:15] the Lord identified him
[1:12:19] how by his voice
[1:12:23] or we should say by his word
[1:12:27] how do we identify ourselves
[1:12:32] that's a good question
[1:12:35] how do we identify ourselves
[1:12:39] who loves the Lord
[1:12:42] oh if you truly believe it I want to see
[1:12:45] hands
[1:12:47] if you truly believe that you're a child
[1:12:49] of God I want to see Hands
[1:12:53] then you're a child of God
[1:12:57] praise God Gloria praise God that you
[1:13:00] can be identified with him
[1:13:05] so I know who what your core identity is
[1:13:08] now
[1:13:11] I know what's your strong identity
[1:13:15] it's not the church member
[1:13:19] it's not it's not the the worker out
[1:13:23] there
[1:13:24] it's not whatever the world tells you
[1:13:30] your core identity is Jesus Christ
[1:13:35] your core identity is what the word says
[1:13:42] that's your identity
[1:13:44] the word says you are my beloved Son in
[1:13:48] whom I'm well pleased
[1:13:52] and his identity was revealed through
[1:13:55] his word
[1:13:58] so through his word we are identified
[1:14:05] how am I identified
[1:14:08] I need something to look at myself
[1:14:12] through his word
[1:14:14] brother brother salcello says we we've
[1:14:18] got to read the message over and over
[1:14:20] and over again
[1:14:24] until it becomes a revelation
[1:14:29] and when the word is revealed to us
[1:14:34] then your identity is revealed in the
[1:14:37] word
[1:14:42] now I want you to understand that our
[1:14:44] people
[1:14:46] how is my identity
[1:14:48] revealed in the word
[1:14:52] because in the world
[1:14:55] and the voice of God was
[1:15:00] said you are my beloved child
[1:15:04] so in that voice
[1:15:07] he was truly revealed who his true
[1:15:10] identity was
[1:15:19] so you look in the word
[1:15:22] and you read it you said and read it and
[1:15:26] read it and read it until it becomes a
[1:15:29] revelation to you
[1:15:32] you will see yourself
[1:15:35] and you when you believe it
[1:15:38] you'll see you'll identify yourself
[1:15:41] there
[1:15:42] identification why porque because if
[1:15:46] anybody believes that they that Jesus
[1:15:49] died on the cross for them
[1:15:52] [Music]
[1:15:55] then you're identified in the Bible
[1:15:59] when he died you know it was for me
[1:16:05] that is the identification
[1:16:10] so the first time we see God speak to
[1:16:12] Jesus he was identified
[1:16:18] brother Branham says and that's what we
[1:16:22] want to look at tonight
[1:16:24] I want to look at me
[1:16:28] now this is in the message
[1:16:30] identification in 1963.
[1:16:35] he says I want to look at me
[1:16:39] who wants to look at themselves who
[1:16:41] wants to know who they are
[1:16:46] see he says I want to look at me and I
[1:16:49] want to want you to look at yourself
[1:16:54] as we look into God's Great mirror of
[1:16:58] his word
[1:17:02] let's be able to identify ourselves with
[1:17:06] some
[1:17:07] with some that we're going to speak
[1:17:09] about some characters of the other times
[1:17:19] I want to see myself in God's looking
[1:17:22] glass
[1:17:25] because if anything your show where
[1:17:28] you're standing in this book
[1:17:34] there's no book like it because it's all
[1:17:36] the truth is
[1:17:40] you want to see where you're standing
[1:17:43] you want to balance yourself
[1:17:46] you want to see where you're at with the
[1:17:49] world and with the word
[1:17:53] read your Bible
[1:17:55] and the the mirror will show your
[1:17:58] condition
[1:18:01] he'll show you who you are
[1:18:04] he'll show you how to fix
[1:18:09] he'll show you how to be identified with
[1:18:12] Christ
[1:18:16] when you become identified with the
[1:18:18] scriptures
[1:18:21] everything from Genesis to Revelation is
[1:18:25] you the Genesis apocalypse is
[1:18:28] then you become I am
[1:18:32] not I will be
[1:18:34] tomorrow I will be
[1:18:37] and you fluctuate with the cultures
[1:18:42] fluctuate with your feelings
[1:18:46] you're five people within a year
[1:18:51] no identify with your with the scripture
[1:18:57] and you will find I am
[1:19:01] what does I am
[1:19:03] it means he never changes significant
[1:19:07] it means you've got an anchor
[1:19:09] significant it means your identity
[1:19:13] will always be stable
[1:19:17] you'll know who you are
[1:19:19] every day the good days and the bad days
[1:19:24] I am
[1:19:28] I am Jose I am a child of God
[1:19:32] I am redeemed
[1:19:35] when you can't say that
[1:19:38] well when you can
[1:19:41] you never say I was redeemed
[1:19:45] or I will be saved
[1:19:48] I am
[1:19:49] you'll be solid
[1:19:52] but brother Branham oh I love when he he
[1:19:56] began to say how he was as an American
[1:19:58] yeah
[1:20:02] he says I am an American and you have to
[1:20:05] identify yourself with America
[1:20:31] he says I was there with George
[1:20:34] Washington
[1:20:35] George Washington he said I was there in
[1:20:38] Plymouth Rock in Plymouth Rock he said I
[1:20:41] was there he said
[1:20:43] with Stonewall Jackson Stonewall Jackson
[1:20:46] he said I was there I'm identified with
[1:20:49] that
[1:20:52] then he says just as much as that is
[1:20:56] a Christian should be identified with
[1:20:59] the word
[1:21:02] When God Says in When God says let there
[1:21:05] be
[1:21:06] there I was there Joseph when God said
[1:21:09] to Job where were you when the sons of
[1:21:11] God shouted for Joy
[1:21:16] I was there
[1:21:18] I can identify myself there
[1:21:23] I was there
[1:21:25] and I will be there in the Rapture
[1:21:27] yesterday
[1:21:31] I am identified with the bride of Jesus
[1:21:34] Christ
[1:21:36] oh to be identified with him
[1:21:40] the brother Brandon says the True Church
[1:21:43] of Jesus Christ
[1:21:46] the bride is likened to pure gold La
[1:21:50] Novia is
[1:21:52] now her righteousness now why does he
[1:21:55] say that pure gold
[1:21:58] because brother Bradham says the more
[1:22:00] you beat the gold
[1:22:04] the more the reflection
[1:22:10] the more the reflection of the beater
[1:22:15] you become a reflection of God
[1:22:20] so her righteousness is his
[1:22:22] righteousness
[1:22:26] her attributes are his own glorious
[1:22:29] attributes
[1:22:33] her identity is found in him
[1:22:37] like that where is my identity
[1:22:42] it's not over there with the world
[1:22:45] it's not found somewhere in Netflix with
[1:22:48] some movie out there
[1:22:51] it's not found with all the the
[1:22:54] influencers out there
[1:22:58] everybody that raised their hand that
[1:23:01] says they are a children of God
[1:23:05] your identity is found in him
[1:23:10] what is he
[1:23:12] or what is he she is to reflect okay
[1:23:23] your identity is him
[1:23:26] what he has she is to manifest
[1:23:32] there is no fault in her life
[1:23:36] whatever the world is identifying you as
[1:23:42] whatever the devil is saying about you
[1:23:46] the Bible says there is no fault in you
[1:23:50] when you are found in him
[1:23:53] she is all glorious within and without
[1:23:57] Aya is
[1:23:59] from beginning to ending she is the work
[1:24:02] of her Lord and all his works are
[1:24:05] perfect
[1:24:10] in fact in her sums up and manifested
[1:24:14] the Eternal wisdom of the purpose of God
[1:24:17] is
[1:24:25] amen praise God glorious
[1:24:28] so so when all this culture is pushed on
[1:24:31] you
[1:24:35] with all this world is that
[1:24:46] that the devil is attacking your
[1:24:48] identity
[1:25:13] he has you in a slave mindset
[1:25:17] he has you not allowing yourself to push
[1:25:22] out the true power of God
[1:25:28] the Bible says that that or brother
[1:25:31] Branham says
[1:25:33] he says that he was almost co-equal with
[1:25:36] God
[1:25:37] [Music]
[1:25:39] he was almost co-equal with God
[1:25:43] he was God's right hand man
[1:25:47] but because he wanted to be God
[1:25:51] that was his desire
[1:25:55] to be an image of God
[1:25:59] but that wasn't his lot to have foreign
[1:26:26] but then there was a certain creature
[1:26:30] that God says let us make man in our own
[1:26:35] image
[1:26:38] that's who you are
[1:26:41] you are in the image of God
[1:26:45] nothing less
[1:26:47] you are children of God
[1:26:50] and because of that the devil hates it
[1:26:54] that's what the devil wanted it's okay
[1:27:20] then Jesus was led up
[1:27:23] of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be
[1:27:25] tempted of the Devils foreign
[1:27:38] now this is the first time in chapter
[1:27:41] four that the devil speaks to Jesus
[1:27:47] and and when he fasted 40 days and 40
[1:27:50] nights he was afterward hungered
[1:27:55] and when the tempter came to him he said
[1:27:58] if thou be the Son of God
[1:28:06] in chapter 3 God says this is my beloved
[1:28:10] Son
[1:28:14] this is my beloved Son he identified who
[1:28:17] he was
[1:28:20] by his word he'll identify you for many
[1:28:43] why did you get a little temper here if
[1:28:45] you're a child of God
[1:28:48] if you're a child of God why do you do
[1:28:51] this
[1:28:52] what is the devil doing
[1:28:55] he's attacking your true identity
[1:29:00] he's attacking who you truly are
[1:29:04] but you know what when you get that
[1:29:07] Revelation
[1:29:10] nothing can stop you
[1:29:13] when you get a revelation of what the
[1:29:16] word is
[1:29:18] if there was a man
[1:29:21] that knew who he was Jesus
[1:29:27] that was Jesus for Jesus
[1:29:30] he was the person that I've heard say I
[1:29:33] am the most
[1:29:37] he wasn't afraid of who he was
[1:29:41] the Bible says or in 10 times the Bible
[1:29:44] declares that he says I am
[1:29:48] he says before Abraham was I am
[1:29:53] he says I am the door and because
[1:29:56] he says I am the truth the life and the
[1:29:59] way
[1:30:02] he says I am the Good Shepherd
[1:30:05] he knew who he was
[1:30:08] if you truly not want to know who you
[1:30:11] are
[1:30:13] you don't have to grow up and mature and
[1:30:16] do all those things
[1:30:20] one day you'll find out what your career
[1:30:22] is
[1:30:25] one day you'll get married
[1:30:28] one day you'll have
[1:30:31] um steady job um
[1:30:34] those are all layers of your identity
[1:30:36] yes
[1:30:39] but we should be on top
[1:30:43] we should be the core identity
[1:30:48] is that I am a child of God
[1:30:55] I was until the devil said this is
[1:31:00] I will be but let me let me just get
[1:31:02] some things done first
[1:31:07] I am
[1:31:09] a child of God
[1:31:11] I am loved
[1:31:14] I am redeemed I don't care what the
[1:31:17] devil says
[1:31:18] I don't care what the what anybody says
[1:31:22] about me what the kind of identity they
[1:31:24] want to push on the importance
[1:31:29] classified God I am a child of God
[1:31:33] Amen Let Us stand to our feet
[1:31:36] amen
[1:31:39] oh Lord we just want to give you the
[1:31:41] honor and the glory god
[1:31:44] Lord because only you
[1:31:47] only you can show us who we truly are
[1:31:50] father and brother
[1:31:53] Lord you said through the words of your
[1:31:55] Prophet
[1:31:58] if the church finds out what her true
[1:32:02] position is
[1:32:06] the rapture will take place
[1:32:09] the Bible says
[1:32:12] that all of creation is in Earnest
[1:32:16] expectation for the manifestation of the
[1:32:18] sons of God
[1:32:23] lord when your children can understand
[1:32:26] and be revealed who they are Lord
[1:32:33] a Rapture will take place
[1:32:37] that's why the devil has such to grip on
[1:32:40] the young people's identity Lord foreign
[1:32:46] [Music]
[1:32:50] Lord when we know we are just like you
[1:32:53] said
[1:32:55] we know that we were bought with the
[1:32:58] price
[1:33:00] when we know that we will redeemed Lord
[1:33:04] we were in the back side of God's
[1:33:07] thinking Lord
[1:33:10] oh nothing can hold us back
[1:33:15] nothing can can bring us down Lord
[1:33:19] why because we have gone to our place
