[0:00] foreign
[1:25] you
[2:49] now
[3:33] do you care
[3:34] my brother william marion branham was
[3:37] liver sunday morning july 21 1963
[3:41] at the branham tabernacle in
[3:42] jeffersonville indiana usa
[3:46] elements
[3:53] foreign
[4:10] let's remain standing just a moment now
[4:12] for prayer
[4:14] now with our heads bowed is there any
[4:17] spoken request or made known by just a
[4:19] lifting of your hand if you just raise
[4:21] up your hand
[4:23] that just holds your request now
[4:43] our heavenly father we are approaching
[4:46] thee
[4:47] again
[4:48] for these requests that
[4:51] they have their hands lifted into the
[4:53] air
[4:54] and they are
[4:55] needy this morning lord of many things
[5:08] it
[5:12] thou does know what they are thinking in
[5:14] their heart because you are the word and
[5:17] the word is a discerner of the thoughts
[5:20] and the intents of the heart
[5:22] is
[5:32] i pray the most gracious god that you
[5:35] will answer each of them according to
[5:38] their needs
[5:39] knowing this that thou will do it
[5:41] according to their faith
[5:44] give us faith as we speak thy word then
[5:46] lord may it bring faith to them
[6:07] help me to speak thy word for thy word
[6:10] is truth that it might bring faith to
[6:12] give answer to these requests
[6:23] and then there might be some here lord
[6:25] who has
[6:26] wandered off of that
[6:28] narrow way
[6:30] that's not walking in the truth of the
[6:32] way we pray father that something will
[6:36] be done today
[6:37] and made known that they will
[6:40] come quickly back to that path of
[6:43] fellowship again with christ
[7:04] the days are growing late
[7:07] evil is on every hand
[7:09] there's a great falling away
[7:11] and we pray father that you will make
[7:13] yourself known to us today by healing
[7:16] the sick in our midst performing
[7:19] miracles
[7:35] not that you have to do it lord let us
[7:38] know that you're god but because you
[7:40] promised to do it
[7:42] and we know that thou will grant to us
[7:45] your promises if we'll only believe them
[7:48] and know they are true
[7:50] we ask this favors in jesus christ's
[7:53] name amen
[8:19] it
[8:30] i was just taking a moment to read some
[8:33] of the requests laying here
[8:36] there's two or three one of them is a
[8:38] request for prayer of course there's
[8:39] many handkerchiefs laying here that we'd
[8:42] be glad to to pray over him just in a
[8:45] little while when we feel that the
[8:47] presence of the holy spirit is as at its
[8:50] peak that's when i try to pray over this
[8:52] when all the congregation all is
[8:54] anointed with his presence
[9:23] we're so sorry to
[9:26] bother
[9:27] have so many standing
[9:29] and not room for them to sit down
[9:32] and this is the day
[9:34] hot weather at its very peak
[9:37] of heat we're having about a hundred
[9:39] percent
[9:41] of humidity in about a hundred degrees
[9:44] so it's very sticky and hot
[9:47] much
[10:06] and i gave out this morning for
[10:09] healing services or not
[10:12] uh what reason i make that healing
[10:14] service because i put my faith in what
[10:17] he promised
[10:19] i cannot say that he will do it but i
[10:21] believe
[10:23] after hearing his word and basing our
[10:25] faith upon
[10:27] what he has promised then we have a
[10:30] right to claim his healing promises just
[10:34] as we do his salvation promises
[10:43] servicio de san nida
[11:08] these
[11:09] couple requests i don't know where they
[11:11] got the recorders going yet for this or
[11:14] not
[11:15] it might be
[11:17] uh
[11:17] good well i guess it's all right for the
[11:19] outside the public to hear this it's a
[11:21] request
[11:36] did you prophesy that there be a million
[11:39] negroes
[11:41] killed
[11:42] on the
[11:44] art did you just announce
[11:46] that there would be this happening
[11:50] [Music]
[11:54] or
[11:58] now
[12:01] see
[12:02] i've always asked you to be careful what
[12:05] you're listening to i think there's so
[12:07] much of it that it's just the human side
[12:11] but always if there is something that
[12:14] goes forth it will speak it it's thus
[12:17] saith the lord even to visions or
[12:20] anything
[12:22] ben
[12:39] the visions on the platform in the
[12:41] audience you are doing that yourself it
[12:44] isn't god it's you
[12:47] see
[12:48] god doesn't produce that vision you do
[12:51] it yourself by your faith in a divine
[12:53] gift
[13:04] no produces
[13:10] like the woman touched his garment he
[13:12] didn't know who she was or what was
[13:14] wrong with her but she did that herself
[13:18] see
[13:19] now that wasn't just saith the lord
[13:22] it was thus saith the lord when jesus
[13:24] spoke back and told her that her faith
[13:26] had saved her
[13:27] but see
[13:29] you have to watch
[13:54] i just was talking about martin luther
[13:57] king
[13:58] on this great
[13:59] disaster that they're having in the
[14:01] south with the the colored people
[14:04] i said
[14:05] if
[14:06] those people were slaves
[14:08] i'd take my church and go south to help
[14:11] them people out of slavery
[14:14] no
[14:31] sure would because
[14:34] man makes slaves not god
[14:36] we're all of one blood we all come from
[14:39] one tree and that was from adam god by
[14:42] one blood has made all nations
[14:58] and whether we our colors are brown or
[15:01] black or yellow or red or whatever it
[15:03] might be we are all creatures of the
[15:06] almighty see and there shouldn't be any
[15:09] differences in us yes
[15:23] the question down there is
[15:25] a segregation of school
[15:28] now i was there at the first uprise
[15:32] and i heard it and i i know from what i
[15:34] speak of the colored people has fine
[15:37] schools sometimes much better than the
[15:39] other schools
[15:52] escuela
[15:55] and for instance shreveport they got
[15:58] finer schools and the white school is
[16:01] but it's the idea of somebody inspiring
[16:04] them that they should go and mix
[16:06] themselves together which i think that
[16:09] it'd be all right but as long as the
[16:10] people are protesting those southern
[16:12] people then what difference does it make
[16:15] anyhow
[16:16] for example in shreveport
[16:19] escuela
[16:20] blanca
[16:37] and i think that martin luther king is
[16:39] communistic inspired
[16:41] which is going to lead about a million
[16:45] people to absolutely a death trap see i
[16:49] don't say the lord told me that i
[16:50] believe see and i believe it shouldn't
[16:53] be done i think that people are to be
[16:55] christians and recognize one another's
[16:57] brothers
[17:22] and but i think just because this united
[17:25] states this government now tells me that
[17:28] i can't even sign a check that's be give
[17:30] to me personally
[17:32] see
[17:33] that's constitutional rights taken from
[17:35] me but what can i do about it just go
[17:37] ahead that's all see it has to go
[17:40] through another system before i as a
[17:42] citizen united states can cash a check
[17:44] has
[18:20] that's not right that's unconstitutional
[18:23] but what what can i do about it there's
[18:25] nothing
[18:26] this tax collector down here someone
[18:28] told me i couldn't do it so well there
[18:30] it is if it is what of it so just let it
[18:33] go yes
[18:55] 960 i think it ought to be the same
[18:58] thing that the
[18:59] my colored brothers and sisters in the
[19:01] south ought to rise up to arms against
[19:03] their brethren and things like over such
[19:05] a little thing is that
[19:07] my what difference does it make if you
[19:08] go to school or what
[19:13] is
[19:26] i seen a fine colored lady that morning
[19:29] one that was they had the revolt there
[19:31] shreveport it was a
[19:33] an old colored minister kept telling
[19:35] militia he said let me speak to them
[19:50] and so he was a godly old man and he
[19:52] stood up there and he said i've never
[19:54] been ashamed of my color
[19:56] he said my maker made me what i am and
[19:59] i've never been ashamed of it but until
[20:02] this morning
[20:03] it was
[20:18] but so when i see you my people acting
[20:20] like this said then i'm ashamed of being
[20:23] a colored man
[20:24] there's a uh
[20:26] militia call hollering down
[20:32] says
[20:38] so some fine educated fine looking
[20:41] colored lady stood up with an
[20:42] intelligence my supreme she said the
[20:46] first thing i don't want my children
[20:47] taught by a white woman said why said
[20:50] because she won't take the interests of
[20:52] my children that my a colored teacher
[21:00] intelligence
[21:14] so look at our schools over here what
[21:16] are you hollering about so we got
[21:17] swimming pools and everything in our
[21:19] schools and they haven't got it over
[21:21] there so now what are you people
[21:23] hollering about and they hollered her
[21:24] down see hey
[21:28] greetings
[21:40] it's inspired of the wrong thing you see
[21:43] see they them people and that's reason i
[21:46] say that not that there is any uh any
[21:49] prophecy concerning it i have nothing on
[21:52] it from the lord
[22:08] and be sure now if i say anything from
[22:11] the lord like that to tell you it's
[22:13] always i'm speaking now but when he
[22:16] speaks i say it's not me it's thus saith
[22:18] the lord and i can't say it until he
[22:20] tells me
[22:22] that
[22:24] was
[22:37] i could be all together wrong in my
[22:38] thought about martin luther king
[22:41] i don't know i can't say that's just my
[22:43] opinion anything it rises up trouble
[22:46] that's what's supposed to be in the last
[22:47] days and it's all spot inspired of satan
[22:50] to break up our commonwealth and
[22:52] whatever we have anything that rises up
[22:54] like that
[23:06] yes
[23:18] so
[23:19] i'm far those people down there don't
[23:21] you never think that i'm not i i'm for
[23:23] freedom and for everything but the
[23:25] people doesn't have that situation under
[23:29] uh now but what it will do i believe
[23:31] it'll start another revolution if
[23:33] somebody doesn't stop it see it's the
[23:35] commonest working among those people
[23:45] live
[24:00] i was in africa when they've done the
[24:01] same thing see and i know there's
[24:03] communists coming there telling those
[24:05] colored people oh you're this that the
[24:07] other you're this that the other and the
[24:08] first thing you know it caused thousands
[24:10] of them to be killed and were they yet
[24:12] nowhere
[24:14] nowhere gustav in africa
[24:16] movement
[24:35] and i love human life let's serve the
[24:37] lord our kingdom is above nothing about
[24:40] this thing here long as we eat drink and
[24:42] can have what else do you want see
[24:44] so i know what it would be i realized
[24:48] that it just caused trouble
[25:08] now another question is here
[25:11] john the baptist when meeting jesus
[25:14] see
[25:15] what did he say thus it behooveth us to
[25:19] fulfill all righteousness
[25:22] what did it mean
[25:26] yes
[25:37] well
[25:38] i remember dr roy davis a personal
[25:42] friend of mine who baptized me
[25:44] the only time i've ever been baptized
[25:47] and he said
[25:49] that john was meaning i remember this in
[25:51] her school he said
[25:53] john
[25:55] know that he had never been baptized
[25:57] himself so he
[25:59] jesus uh john suffered jesus to baptize
[26:02] him well that i i different with the
[26:06] great doctor there
[26:07] bueno recorded dr
[26:34] not for controversy but for the sake of
[26:36] truth i might say this
[26:38] no
[26:40] there was two man the two leaders of the
[26:43] hour
[26:44] the messiah and his prophet met in the
[26:47] water
[26:48] controversial
[27:01] now remember john was baptizing not for
[27:04] remission of sins
[27:06] but unto repentance
[27:08] not for remission of sins because the
[27:11] offering had not yet been made
[27:13] there was no sacrifice
[27:15] and the sacrifice come to him in the
[27:17] water
[27:18] hola
[27:38] now notice
[27:39] john looking up and seeing jesus
[27:42] he said i have need to be baptized of
[27:45] thee and why cometh thou unto me
[27:48] jesus said suffer that to be so which it
[27:51] was
[27:52] suffer it to be so for thus it behooveth
[27:55] us or it's becoming to us to fulfill all
[27:58] righteousness
[28:19] then john being a prophet on who the
[28:22] word of the lord come
[28:24] comes only to the prophet john being a
[28:26] prophet understood if that was a
[28:28] sacrifice and according to the law that
[28:31] the sacrifice had to be washed before
[28:34] presented and that's the reason he
[28:35] baptized it
[28:59] he said thus it behooveth us to fulfill
[29:01] all righteousness
[29:03] the sacrifice which he was must be
[29:05] washed in the lava before presented for
[29:08] sacrifice and jesus was the sacrifice
[29:12] and john knew it
[29:13] and he knew that he must be washed
[29:16] before presented and then immediately
[29:18] edwards he was presented to the public
[29:20] for trial and was a sacrifice for all
[29:23] human life
[29:24] lord
[29:51] um
[29:55] now
[29:56] we're going to have a little short
[29:58] message
[29:59] and trusting the lord will grant to us
[30:02] his blessings
[30:11] now
[30:13] probably if i get back i'm leaving this
[30:15] next week to take the kiddies on a
[30:17] little vacation up in the hills
[30:19] and then
[30:21] if i if i get back in time we want to
[30:24] speak next sunday morning if it's
[30:26] permissible to god and to the pastor
[30:28] here we'll let you know this week
[30:30] farther you it's out of town by the way
[30:33] of letter hora probably
[30:48] is
[30:53] i want to speak on a subject of exactly
[30:57] why
[30:58] we believe the things that we believe
[31:01] about christ why it must be this way and
[31:04] cannot be no other way see and prove it
[31:07] by the scriptures
[31:14] christ
[31:23] if the lord believes it don't i'll try
[31:25] to see you this winter or next summer
[31:26] one when we get back if the lord tarries
[31:29] we're going now back home to arizona so
[31:32] get the children in school
[31:44] arizona
[31:47] now this morning just
[31:49] uh
[31:50] prior to the prayer for the sick
[31:54] uh we are going to read some of god's
[31:56] word which we know that
[31:58] without this word it's impossible
[32:01] there's nothing can be done and only the
[32:03] word can produce
[32:06] these blessings that we're asking for
[32:08] the sick and the needy
[32:11] just
[32:28] and i want to read some now from first
[32:31] peter
[32:32] the fifth chapter
[32:34] beginning with the first verse
[32:37] and then from the book of hebrews i want
[32:39] to read hebrews 2
[32:54] the elders which are among you i exhort
[32:58] whom am also an elder and a witness of
[33:03] the suffering of christ
[33:05] and also a partaker of the glory that
[33:08] shall be
[33:24] feed the flock of god which is among you
[33:27] take the
[33:28] oversight thereof
[33:31] not by constraint but
[33:34] willingly
[33:36] not for filthy lucr
[33:40] but of a ready mind
[33:44] neither as being large over god's
[33:47] heritage
[33:48] but being examples to
[34:16] and when the chief shepherd shall appear
[34:19] ye shall receive a crown of glory that
[34:22] fadeth not awake.
[34:31] likewise ye younger
[34:33] submit yourselves unto the elder
[34:37] yea all of you be subject one to another
[34:41] and be not close
[34:43] and be clothed with humility
[34:46] for god resists us the proud and giveth
[34:49] grace to the humble equalment
[34:53] estas
[35:00] vestidos
[35:11] humble yourselves under the mighty hand
[35:14] of god
[35:15] that he may exalt you in due
[35:18] time
[35:21] casting all your care upon him for he
[35:25] careth for you
[35:27] um
[35:43] and in hebrews the second chapter
[35:46] we read these words
[35:49] now i'm pulling for giving for a text
[35:53] cast in your care i'm my text is he
[35:57] cares do you care
[35:59] enemies
[36:15] want to read this potion now while
[36:17] you're turning to hebrews 2
[36:19] that you might see the the real
[36:22] meaning of these words what the what
[36:24] this text means
[36:37] therefore we ought to give the more
[36:39] earnest heed to the things which we have
[36:41] heard
[36:43] lest at any time we should let them slip
[36:47] or if the words spoken by angels were
[36:50] steadfast
[36:52] and ever transgression and disobedience
[36:54] received a just recompense of reward
[37:18] how shall we escape if we neglect our
[37:21] great salvation
[37:22] which at the first begin
[37:25] to be spoken by the lord and was
[37:28] confirmed
[37:30] unto us by them that heard him
[37:46] god also bearing witness with both with
[37:50] signs and wonders and diverse miracles
[37:53] and gifts of the holy ghost according to
[37:55] his own will
[38:09] i want to use the subject here
[38:13] of he cares
[38:16] and do you
[38:24] when he was here on earth
[38:28] he cared for the people
[38:32] the thought of it rises in my mind just
[38:35] before
[38:36] speaking or praying for the sick
[38:40] not knowing just what kind of a
[38:42] of a prayer line that we'll have
[38:59] uh first
[39:01] it to approach this the audience
[39:04] must be anointed
[39:06] with faith
[39:08] if you do not have faith then there's
[39:11] there's no need of even coming to be
[39:12] prayed for
[39:14] because it's going to take your faith
[39:16] and my faith together
[39:19] my faith to believe in your faith to
[39:21] believe him
[39:23] john
[39:32] [Music]
[39:46] so we
[39:47] don't forget this now so go along
[39:50] we've got to have something evidently
[39:53] with evidence i mean
[39:55] that we can base our faith upon what
[39:58] we're trying to do
[40:05] necessarily
[40:14] because if a man approaches anything
[40:16] that he wants to do without sufficient
[40:19] faith he's bound to be a failure
[40:22] but if he can approach it with
[40:25] sufficient faith
[40:26] then he's bound to succeed if
[40:29] it is according to god's will and
[40:31] purpose
[40:32] to do it
[40:53] now
[40:56] i was thinking of him caring
[40:59] last evening somehow strangely i was
[41:02] led
[41:04] by the holy spirit when i was waiting on
[41:07] some fellows to come to help brother
[41:09] wood to put a a trailer uh he'd build on
[41:12] the back of his truck
[41:30] i didn't know why i was trying to find
[41:31] my good friend brother evans
[41:34] and i went i started up the highway
[41:36] which my wife and family studying back
[41:39] here
[41:40] knows it to be true and
[41:42] somehow strange that i turned around and
[41:44] went back to a place
[42:04] all how it thrilled my heart to see so
[42:06] many my friends gathered there in about
[42:08] two minutes time till it clogged the
[42:10] pathway the cars couldn't pass through
[42:12] no more
[42:13] just real friends driving for hundreds
[42:16] of miles from georgia and tennessee
[42:19] and alabama and all around
[42:22] just to hear
[42:25] a service
[42:41] tennessee
[42:49] come on my mind then what should i say
[42:52] to those people knowing that in the day
[42:53] of judgment i have to answer for what i
[42:55] tell
[42:56] them and i too am a
[43:00] i'm a lover of this great life that is
[43:02] to come and i i want to be there
[43:24] and then strangely i went to a place
[43:26] where i made a odd turn instead of
[43:29] turning around there i went up to make a
[43:30] turn
[43:32] the lights flashed on
[43:34] lovely
[43:35] couples on the outside two fine young
[43:38] ladies that i just married to to find
[43:41] young ministers
[43:59] and satan and whiter seen the minister
[44:02] one of them his ministry being set and
[44:04] he took a a life's companion right
[44:06] you're this altered
[44:08] they went away happily on the honeymoon
[44:10] and the enemy jumped on to this young
[44:13] man
[44:20] a company
[44:29] and i'm saying this to express what i'm
[44:31] saying does he care
[44:34] somehow with faith that would not take
[44:37] no they turned and returned back here
[44:40] knowing actually it was all way over in
[44:42] way in the east here somewhere on their
[44:44] honeymoon returned back
[44:46] and was sitting waiting
[45:08] and i walked in fine handsome young man
[45:11] his wife sitting on the outside crying
[45:13] her
[45:14] and their little
[45:15] companion and the other man and the
[45:17] other brother coming running which is a
[45:19] friend of this young man
[45:22] saying
[45:22] oh brother branham such and such has
[45:25] happened
[45:40] went there and seen this handsome young
[45:42] man sitting there just in the peak of
[45:44] his life
[45:45] a leader of young man
[45:48] sitting there in the satan bound him
[45:57] leader the homeless centa
[46:02] he never noticed but i took my hand left
[46:04] to shake hands with his hand right to
[46:06] see if some disease had plagued him but
[46:09] there was no sign of vibration
[46:23] coming right out of the room from
[46:24] praying and
[46:25] fasting and waiting upon the lord the
[46:28] anointing of the holy spirit was there
[46:29] and that's why it led us
[46:37] to establish
[46:41] and then seeing this shadow of darkness
[46:43] over him i never said what i was doing
[46:45] but in less than a couple of moments
[46:47] time it was all gone the coldness of his
[46:50] hands had left he was shouting and
[46:52] praising god a few minutes to find
[46:54] themselves and hear this set right here
[46:56] this morning sitting in the audience
[47:20] see how satan was trying to upset that
[47:24] young man
[47:25] by referring to him as some complex to
[47:28] be built back which the holy spirit knew
[47:30] and
[47:31] seen it by the vision of the lord but
[47:34] god cared for that man god cared for
[47:37] that young boy
[47:39] ben come on
[47:56] just coming in a few moments ago a lady
[47:59] i see her sitting here in the aisle with
[48:01] no
[48:01] or just got her seat somewhere and sat
[48:04] down
[48:06] she said nine years brother brandon i've
[48:08] tried to get a hold of you and she said
[48:11] i'm so desperate here late and couldn't
[48:13] even get a prayer card to be in the
[48:15] lineup
[48:36] billy of course it's his orders to see
[48:38] that i'm not bothered take me in and out
[48:41] don't feel hard at billy he's commanded
[48:43] by this board of trustees to do that and
[48:45] if you didn't i wouldn't be able to get
[48:46] to the prayer line getting here you
[48:48] realize that see there's got to be a
[48:50] system to whatever we're doing we we got
[48:52] to have it
[49:14] haciendo
[49:18] but him saying come on daddy hurry up
[49:21] this
[49:22] the lady
[49:23] moved back and she said brother bram
[49:25] just a word with you
[49:27] standing there a vision broke over this
[49:30] fine looking
[49:32] young woman
[49:33] and seeing that her heart was burned
[49:54] you're trying to work and make a living
[49:56] in a great thing happened back way back
[49:59] in the time of her parents
[50:02] that it caused this great thing to
[50:04] happen to her
[50:06] and the lord jesus revealed it and
[50:08] showed what it was and there in a
[50:11] moment's time took it from the woman
[50:24] caused
[50:35] she went around rejoicing and now
[50:36] sitting here
[50:38] in the audience with us now
[50:41] rejoicing with tears and she's wiping
[50:44] her eyes now knowing that the truth of
[50:46] the thing was made known
[51:02] and that what that poor little neurotic
[51:05] woman
[51:06] that was so nervous she didn't know what
[51:08] to do with herself and thinking that she
[51:10] was gone and there was no holy spirit
[51:12] and this is her last day she tried for
[51:14] nine years and she was about at the end
[51:16] of despair god cared for that little
[51:19] woman who no one cares for amen
[51:24] what a time
[51:26] he does care
[51:27] yes
[51:55] when he was shared on earth is to say he
[51:57] cared for the people so much until he
[51:59] healed their sick comfort their hearts
[52:02] told them about a
[52:03] a place that or he would go and prepare
[52:06] for them and would come again to receive
[52:08] them and to himself
[52:10] he cared for them
[52:28] and notice
[52:30] he cared so much until when he knowed he
[52:34] must leave in order to bring this great
[52:36] thing to us he said i'll not leave you
[52:39] comfortless
[52:42] but i will send the holy spirit and he
[52:46] shall continue my care for you
[52:50] until he returns
[53:12] there's no one cares like jesus
[53:15] knowing that his body
[53:17] as a high priest
[53:19] in the meteoral work that he's doing now
[53:21] that body must be in the presence of god
[53:24] at all times for intercession that god
[53:26] cannot see the sinner's sin
[53:28] he sees only the blood of his own son
[53:33] jesus
[53:39] is
[53:53] and knowing that he sent back the holy
[53:56] spirit to continue to comfort his people
[54:01] does he care
[54:03] certainly he cares
[54:08] continued
[54:16] now
[54:18] he was to continue to care for the
[54:21] people his people here on earth
[54:24] in the same manner that he cared for him
[54:26] when he was here because he said in
[54:29] saint john the 15th chapter if you want
[54:31] to make i've got notes laying here with
[54:32] these scriptures where i'm referring to
[54:34] saint john 15 26-27
[54:55] i see many of you writing the scriptures
[54:57] down so i may refer to this if you don't
[54:59] know it many times to the scripture i
[55:01] write the scripture down that i know
[55:02] what i'm speaking of from here because
[55:04] it's always in the word of the lord
[55:17] land
[55:22] he said when the holy spirit has come
[55:26] who the father would stand in his name
[55:30] he would testify him in other words he
[55:32] would do the same thing he did
[55:34] the holy spirit working through a
[55:36] tabernacle that he had sanctified would
[55:39] do the same thing that he did
[56:01] now what that ought to do for us
[56:04] then we know that right among us today
[56:07] we have the same comforting lord jesus
[56:11] in the form of the holy ghost
[56:13] another office that god himself is
[56:16] working
[56:22] on
[56:36] it was a comfort to israel when they
[56:38] could look up and see the pillar of fire
[56:41] and here the prophets speak the words
[56:43] that was true and god vindicated
[56:46] that was their comfort
[56:49] israel
[57:00] he was a comfort when he was here on
[57:02] earth as a man
[57:04] god made flesh
[57:05] god representing himself and expressed
[57:07] himself through a man christ jesus who
[57:11] promised that the works that i do shall
[57:13] you do also
[57:20] represent
[57:31] now i'm going to the father and go to
[57:32] send back the holy spirit which will be
[57:35] me in spirit form and i'll be with you
[57:38] and dwell in you and the very same
[57:40] things that i've done here the holy
[57:42] spirit will do again in my name when he
[57:44] comes in
[57:51] for the spirit
[58:04] that's why i said to speak against that
[58:06] now after the atonement's already made
[58:08] was unpardonable sin to blaspheme the
[58:10] holy ghost
[58:21] and he would do it in the same way so
[58:23] that we would know whether it was a
[58:25] comfort from some
[58:27] earthly
[58:28] standpoint
[58:30] whether we know it was a comfort from
[58:32] some elderly person who could put their
[58:34] arms around us and hug us a little and
[58:36] make us feel good
[58:43] is
[58:52] or some a theological term
[58:55] of a denomination that would say now you
[58:57] belong to us and we got it and don't
[58:59] belong to the rest of them because they
[59:01] haven't welcomed
[59:13] he made this directly sure
[59:17] see
[59:18] he will speak in my name
[59:21] the works that i do will you do also
[59:24] when he's upon you see he would comfort
[59:28] in the same way
[59:30] by forgiving all of our sins healing all
[59:33] of our sicknesses and speaking to us of
[59:36] comfort of the kingdom that is to come
[59:42] hello
[1:00:01] see
[1:00:02] proving himself among us as god proved
[1:00:05] himself among us by jesus christ
[1:00:09] and in
[1:00:11] second timothy first timothy 3 16
[1:00:13] it's written
[1:00:15] this way
[1:00:17] know about god
[1:00:19] without controversy we realize that
[1:00:22] great is a mystery of godliness for a
[1:00:24] god
[1:00:25] was manifested in the flesh
[1:00:29] we saw god in flesh
[1:00:39] christ
[1:01:00] that was god's comfort to know that he
[1:01:03] calmed so much he cared for us until he
[1:01:06] could become one of us
[1:01:09] god manifested in the flesh not just
[1:01:12] another person but god himself
[1:01:28] and now to make it another step closer
[1:01:31] he sends the holy spirit to care for our
[1:01:35] comforts and he abides in us
[1:01:42] oh it does care
[1:01:47] about
[1:01:59] now we must go on to another portion of
[1:02:02] scripture here or another thought to
[1:02:05] back this up
[1:02:07] before i go i might say this everybody
[1:02:10] doesn't have this comforter
[1:02:18] and
[1:02:24] they don't they don't have it
[1:02:27] so
[1:02:28] the reason they don't have it is because
[1:02:31] they don't accept it
[1:02:34] it's for them but they don't accept it
[1:02:49] now i hope that you're spiritual enough
[1:02:51] to to read what i'm saying
[1:02:54] see
[1:02:55] i'm speaking to a group of people that's
[1:02:57] to be prayed for in a few minutes
[1:03:10] and we have this comfort in holy spirit
[1:03:12] that sent far the comforter but all
[1:03:15] people won't receive that they don't
[1:03:17] believe in it
