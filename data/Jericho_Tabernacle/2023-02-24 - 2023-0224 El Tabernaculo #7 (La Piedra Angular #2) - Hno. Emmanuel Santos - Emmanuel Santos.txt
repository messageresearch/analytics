receive their answers and their blessings being that I don't know any one of their problems they can recognize it was not I foreign but it was the Lord Jesus Christ that simply decided to use a vessel to speak unto his children therefore we ask for your anointing and for your guidance this evening we asked for all this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen as we're standing I'd like to go to the Book of Luke chapter 20. we're going to start with verse 9. Lucas Luke 20 9 says then began here to speak to the people this Parable a certain man planted a Vineyard and led it forth to husbandmen and went into a far country for a long time and at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen that they should give of the fruit of the vineyard but the husbandman beat him and sent him away empty is and again he sent another servant and they beat him also and entreated him shamefully and sent him away empty foreign and again they sent a third and wounded him also and cast him out then said the Lord of The Vineyard what shall I do I will send my beloved Son that it may be it may be they will reverence him when they see him but when the husbandmen saw him they reasoned amongst themselves saying this is the heir come let us kill him and The Inheritance may be ours so they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him what therefore shall the Lord of The Vineyard do unto them is he said he shall come and destroy these husbandmen and shall give the vineyard to others and when they heard it they said and he beheld them and said what is what is this that is written the stone which the builders rejected the same has become the head of the corner whosoever shall fall upon the stone shall be broken but whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder may the Lord has blessings to his words you may be seated this evening I want to continue speaking about the Cornerstone something that always seems so interesting to me the Jesus of Jesus when he speaks about the Cornerstone first of all he always speaks about a Vineyard so he first speaks of the vineyard and a Vineyard is where they cultivate grapes so that once it reaches its time they can take those grapes and eat them or create wine out of those grapes Jesus Jesus always wants for his Vineyards for them to give their fruit and when Jesus speaks of The Vineyards there's men that work in The Vineyards and then the time the season comes where the Lord or the master of The Vineyards he sends a man to get the fruit to get the good work to get the fruits of the spirit the laborers or the husbands they cannot give that fruit and like we spoke last time it's it's in waves waves of opportunity that God grants so Jesus speaks of the vineyard and since he spoke that they rejected the men that he sent he makes reference to the parable angular of the rejection they gave they gave him towards the Cornerstone brother Brandon says and the message is your life worthy of the gospel and he reads this scripture and then he's speaking about these Parables and he says in paragraph 35 that happens in all ages the rejection of the Cornerstone is something that happens in every age he said it went back into all the ages and we find that Parables and how he sent his servants to collect from this Vineyard the first servant to come Casey and they run servant after servant off Los Hombres the cruel men the king finally sent his son and when the sun came we find out they said this is we'll kill him and we'll have all things Jesus said to them the king sent forth and slew those murderers and burnt their cities now when Jesus speaks about The Vineyards he speaks of Israel Israel were the first that received the opportunity to produce a good fruit foreign okay paragraph 39 he continues saying now him speaking directly to Israel the ones that was called To The Feast that I would also apply today to men like Iglesia the church who has been bitten Avenida La Fiesta to come to the feast and won't do it the spiritual Feast of the Lord and they won't do it they don't want to do it they've got other things to do they find excuses Jesus was trying to tell them that they're excuses was what killed the prophets and by doing so had made the word of God of no effect Lavinia now the vineyard is that's Israel and it says in the Bible in Isaiah chapter five verse now will I sing to my well-beloved a song of my beloved touching his Vineyard my well-beloved half the vineyard in a very fruitful Hill is and he fenced it and gathered out the stones thereof and planted it with the choicest vine and built a tower in the midst of it and also made a wine press therein and he looked that it should that it should bring forth grapes and it brought forth wild grapes now remember God wanted that first of all for Israel to produce good fruits in this case they're grapes but it did not produce the right grapes It produced wild grapes and now o inhabitants of Jerusalem and Men of Judah judge I pray you betwixt me and my Vineyards what could have been done more to my Vineyard that I have not done in it wherefore when I look that it should bring forth grapes brought it forth wild grapes and now go to and now go to I will tell you that I will do to my Vineyard I will take away the Hedge thereof and it shall be eaten up and break down the wall thereof and it shall be trodden down remember Jesus says because you've rejected what was first given to you it'll be taken away and given unto the Gentiles verse and I will lay it to waste it shall not be pruned nor digged but there shall come up Briars and Thorns I will also command the loud clouds that they rain no rain upon it and so for this entire time that God wanted to give the Holy Ghost to the Gentiles the spiritual condition of Israel it's like verse six ways and it shall not be pruned or dig but therefore come up Briars and Thorns I will also command the clouds that they Reign no rain upon it finally verse 7. for the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel so Israel was the first Vineyard they had the opportunity to produce the right grapes but since they rejected now they're left with nothing no fruits now there's a new vineyard remember these are the husbandmen that are working in the vineyard now First Corinthians for we are the laborers together with God ye are God's husbandry ye are God's Building is Jesus remember that's Jesus speaks first of all at the vineyard he connects that Parable onto the Cornerstone and Paul's doing the same thing for your laborers with God and your God's Building according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation and another upon another building thereon but let every man take heed to his own building there upon for other Foundation can no man lay that is laid which is Jesus Christ so then the first Vineyard that was Israel the first labor a husbandry husband those were the citizens of Israel being that they rejected Jesus the new vineyard is for all the Gentiles and now the new husbands are those that Jesus that they preach the gospel says that the husband those are the preachers to produce good fruit you are The Vineyards and the preachers are the husbands they need to preach the good word of God to produce a good fruit in you now when Jesus speaks of the vineyard he connects it then to the Cornerstone in Isaiah 28 verse 16. this is therefore thus saith the Lord God behold I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone a tried Stone a precious Cornerstone a Shore Foundation he that believeth shall not make haste aura now that is the Cornerstone that's placed on Zion the first message I preached on the Tabernacle I spoke about Shiloh yeah and I spoke how it is it's a place and it's a person just like Jesus Christ but it's also God's Temple as a person the new vineyard be non-level it produces new wine recorded now remember the day of Pentecost they were so drunk they were saying we have new wine the right grapes remember when Joshua Los doses when both spies entered into the promised land and came back with the evidence they came back with grapes they said the land is good verse 5. now remember these were the husbands they killed the prophets and then finally they killed Jesus and it came to pass on the morrow that their rulers the elders and the scribes and ananiah and anus the high priest and caiphes and John and Alexander And as many were of the Kindred of the high priests were gathered together at Jerusalem so then here are the ancient husbands that cannot produce a fruit they're persecuting the new husband man and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or by what name have you done this then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and Elders of Israel beneficios if we this day be examined of the good deed done unto the impotent Man by means he is made whole Los buenos Los nuevos labradores the new husbands are producing good fruits of Divine Healing verse 10. be known unto you all and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom ye crucified whom God raised from the dead even by him does this man stand here before you whole yeah this is the stone which was set not of you Builders which has become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under Heaven given amongst men whereby ye must be saved so the new husband they're producing good fruits of Salvation and fruits of healing aura it was made solely the materials of materials from the Jews but when Solomon's Temple was made it was made from various materials from around the world now Moses it represents a single person it represents Jesus Christ now Solomon's Temple it speaks of another person of another body the multiples of a multi-member it speaks about the bride it speaks about God's children says in the message Israel in the church number two this is listen when they built the temple of Solomon they and any of you Masons now could get this pretty good they brought down Cedars down from Lebanon foreign but every one of them went together they started laying the thing putting the building up getting along fine and they found a funny looking Stone they didn't want that thing they said they don't belong here they kicked it out they throw it over the weed piles and come to find out they built on and on and they found that they come to find out the very Stone they had rejected was the Chief Cornerstone Jesus said so and today the methodists everywhere around in the building of the spiritual house is the holy spirit you're afraid of it foreign but there's a genuine article of the holy spirit in the baptism Los Angeles oh the the builders they're a different groups that reject that stone just like in the naturals they're building Solomon's Temple and they saw this strange Stone they threw it out they rejected it but then in the spiritual the husband those builders in other words the preachers the Ministers of the various groups they see Jesus Christ and you can see the reaction at the Cornerstone it can cause and since they don't want to act that way they reject it generation but thou O Lord shall endure forever and thy remembrance unto all generations thou shall arise and have mercy upon Zion for the time to favor her yea the set time is come now remember Scion is the place but the Bible speaks of Zion as a woman when the Lord shall build up Zion he shall appear in his glory to declare the name of the Lord in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem now Moses is Tabernacle there's a scripture where the Bible says God told Moses I will cause my name to be there and the name of that Tabernacle it was Jesus Christ now the name of the lord it's in Zion because when there's a matrimony the wife takes on the husband's name is you're the feminine aspect of God you're the feminine Tabernacle they came out of God because it came out of him you've got his name the Bible says that all of God's family all of God's family is under the name of the Lord Jesus Christ all right now in regards to Solomon's Temple foreign distinct form in foreign to whom coming as unto a living Stone disallowed disallowed indeed of man but chosen of God and precious Vivas said sacrifices he also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house and a priest a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ so then the various stones that were brought from different places it spoke about how the New Testament there will be living stones they'll come from different parts of the world to form God's house wherefore also it contained in the scripture behold I lay in Scion a Chief Cornerstone elect precious that he would that he that believeth on him shall not be confounded foreign let's go to Acts 2 1. now remember that's the Cornerstone principal that's the chief Stone and other Stones as well because Jesus is that Chief person that must be in God's house then all the rest come from but Jesus Christ is the main one just like us here there's many people here seated in the benches most important person that needs to be here is Jesus Christ had to be there Jesus Christ is the most important and we're built upon him but he's the foundation in Acts 2 1 it says and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were with one Accord in one place and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and they were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under Heaven remember they were Stones they were brought from various places on the earth of different nations verse 7. now when this was noise abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language and they were all amazed and Marvel say one to another behold are not of these which speak galileans and how here we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born since there were different people from different parts of the world they spoke in different languages but when the Chiefs the chief Stone came when Jesus Christ arrives everyone could understand now we've also had the Cornerstone in everyone could understand in their language they all got together perfectly with the help of that Chief Stone now the reason that that stone it's rejected brother Brandon says that it had a funny-like appearance or a freak Stone now if it was a freak Stone in the natural that has to be a freak Stone in the spirit is when a person receives the Holy Ghost they act in a way that's not common and all the rest that are looking at that person they say what's going on with that person that he's acting so strange that is the Holy Ghost but that is the Cornerstone that's the Holy Ghost remember now every one of those stones it had a different appearance to the others just like I'm different from Marcos Marcos does things that I'd like to do Marco says qualities that I'd like to have just like Marcos can do things that I can do God formed him different than how God formed me we're part of the same house foreign I just love that about you because every stone is different but every stone is essential in the Lord's House they rebuilt the temple and that's registered in Ezra 3-1 it speaks about the Reconstruction of Solomon's Temple and when the seventh month was come the children of Israel were in the cities the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem now for you to see the importance of the first verse just observe the attitude that they had they were in unity if you go to acts 2. in English the Bible says in English that they were in one Accord not that they just got there and started to do whatever they wanted they were in one mind and then started to work and then God sent the Holy Ghost is required to lay the foundation verse two this is and his Brethren and building an altar of God and build an altar of the god of Israel to offer burnt offerings thereon as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God verse six this is from the first day of the seventh month began day to offer burnt offerings unto the Lord but the foundation of the Temple of the Lord was not yet laid and when the builders laid the foundation of the Temple of the Lord they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets and the Levites the sons of asaph with symbols to praise the Lord after the ordinance of David the king of Israel and they sang together by course and praying and giving thanks unto the Lord because he is good for his mercy endureth forever toward Israel and all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the Lord because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid now see the reaction that happens to these men when the foundation is laid they've got some type of reaction but many of the priests and Levites and Chiefs of the fathers who were ancient men they had seen the first house when the foundation of the house was laid Before Their Eyes wept with a loud voice and many shouted aloud for joy so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of Joy from the noise of the Weeping of the people for the people shouted with a loud shout and the noise was heard afar off remember now every stone is different every person here is different it's the same holy ghost that enters the person but since the person is it causes a different reaction foreign different forms the same holy ghosts but in the individuals it causes a strange reaction in you when the Holy Spirit touches you he says I um the Holy Ghost it's represented as fires if natural fire touches you're going to shake your hand like this if the Holy Ghost Fire touches you know it'll make some type of reaction in you [Music] but every stone is different every person is different but when it touches you it causes you a reaction strange you think what am I doing I act like this is that's the Cornerstone the Holy Ghost foreign or Joshua does the work through his husband to bring forth the temperature to bring forth the Cornerstone it speaks of Jesus Christ as a high priest all right recording now remember cuando Josue el Guerrero now when Joshua the warrior he entered into the promised land with the people of Israel brother Brown says that represented how it is the Jesus Christ he takes us unto the promised land unto the promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost so then Solomon's Temple foreign taking all the people back onto the Promised Land so those two important they are really important Jesus Christ as a high priest he is the Son of God brother Brandon says in the message the Mighty God unveiled before us he said then we find after his death burial and Resurrection he came to the day of Pentecost as Son of God the spirit in the form of the Holy Ghost what was he doing he was changing himself making himself known to his people in a different form like the Holy Spirit which is he came to deal through the churches as the Son of God the Holy Spirit that's why it's Jesus Christ the son of God but he also has his husband his ministers there's seven main ministers which are the seven Messengers it means the Lord the savior his husband in that photo there's two people that's Jesus and brother Branham now when you hear Brother Brian when he speaks about that photo brother Brandon never says that photo is of himself he says that's a photo of Jesus and Jesus allowed for him to be with him in the picture hey man so then if they criticize that we've got the picture of a man yes but it's because Jesus allowed him to be in the picture because Jesus Christ he is the Cornerstone and then all of us we are built upon that stone as a high priest he is a Son of God the Bible says in Hebrews 4 14. Jesus seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God our recording now remember it is the high priest with his Builder that they lay the temple they lay the Cornerstone foreign that's why the holy spirit is so important for every husband and for every builder in other words for other all preachers because Paul himself says once he's received the Holy Spirit I lay the foundation which is Jesus Christ that's why you require the high priest the Holy Ghost upon the physical body of a husbandman to produce good fruits it's not us I don't have the power of a savior I don't have the power of a Healer I don't have any of those Powers but if God can heal someone through a prayer [Music] it was not the minister it was God the Cornerstone the holy ghost that is in that husband because the husband is the one that does the physical labor but the orders come from him the honor and glorious for Jesus Christ there's no way for any of us deliver somebody it's Jesus Christ through the Builder construction that does a good Construction that produces the good fruit if we can stand let us pray Lord Heavenly Father well we thank you for your word Lord foreign that produces the good fruit bless the rest of the service in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you [Applause] [Music] thank you anymore [Music] to be that foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yes for me [Music] now [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign oh people [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you Jesus Jesus [Music] and names [Music] [Music] Jesus [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] everybody easy [Music] [Music] [Music] so for this is [Music] [Music] from your business [Music] [Music] [Music] this Christmas see [Music] me [Music] please [Music] [Music] [Music] is this is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] is to please [Music] time has come to dismiss the service but before we do we have some petitions Rodriguez our brother Michael Rodriguez is asking prayer for him and his family we also have traveling Mercies [Music] we ask you to please keep our brother Napoleon sister Andrea Santos brother Emmanuel Santos and our brother Jessica and Elise in prayer as they travel to Magdalena Mexico this weekend when Cinemas is if we can please have the petition in our hearts if you can please buy your heads tonight Lord for this wonderful service you've permitted Senor just asking Lord that your Holy Spirit may always be present here is always be glorify your name is maybe from even though it's from different ways but can we still Worship You Lord and tonight we put these petitions Onto You Lord put your Almighty hands over them but never from your presence we ask all of this in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen OS IMO services [Music] oh [Music] it is down foreign [Music] on my mind [Music] [Music] when I go [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music]
