[36:21] um
[36:24] [Music]
[37:08] [Music]
[37:22] [Music]
[37:25] foreign
[37:37] [Music]
[37:47] my
[38:09] this is
[38:13] [Music]
[38:21] just as you are standing if we can open
[38:23] our bibles to luke 18 verse 9.
[38:30] lucas diciocho
[38:41] and the bible says and he spake this
[38:43] parable unto certain which trusted in
[38:45] themselves that they were righteous and
[38:47] despised others
[38:50] [Music]
[38:57] is that it
[39:12] two men went up into the temple to pray
[39:14] the one a pharisee and the other
[39:16] republicans
[39:17] [Music]
[39:23] the pharisees stood and prayed thus with
[39:25] himself god i thank thee that i am not
[39:28] as are the men
[39:29] are extortioners unjust adulterers or
[39:32] even as a republican
[39:40] come on
[39:47] and the publicans standing far off would
[39:49] not lift up so much as his eyes into
[39:52] heaven
[39:53] but smote upon his breasts saying god be
[39:55] merciful to me a sinner
[39:58] you know those vessels
[40:02] [Music]
[40:09] [Music]
[40:23] [Music]
[40:27] i tell you this man went down to his
[40:29] house justified rather than the other
[40:32] for everyone that exalts himself shall
[40:34] be a base and the
[40:35] humbleth himself shall be exalted
[40:48] [Music]
[41:01] our precious lord heavenly father
[41:04] salvador
[41:16] even though there might be good things
[41:18] that we can do on our own
[41:24] that's not the attitude that we want to
[41:26] take yes
[41:29] we want to come humbly before you get
[41:46] i pray that you bless the service
[41:49] and may you give a portion to every one
[41:51] of your children
[41:54] for we ask for these things in the name
[41:55] of the lord jesus christ
[41:59] amen amen
[42:09] uh
[42:10] this evening i'm going to continue with
[42:12] that the series of the tabernacle
[42:20] this is uh i'm going to speak about the
[42:22] altar that's in the tabernacle
[42:27] now
[42:28] the one thing that i want you to notice
[42:30] about the these two men
[42:34] it was two men that went to the temple
[42:38] temple
[42:40] a man that was humbling himself
[42:52] he represents a sinner el represented
[42:56] and
[42:56] the pharisee
[42:58] he represents the religious center
[43:04] he also represents the hypocrite
[43:08] now the republican our public
[43:14] it says that he he wouldn't even dare to
[43:16] look up to heaven
[43:21] now i want to read this quote from
[43:22] brother branham
[43:25] brother branham says in the message
[43:26] hidden life with christ
[43:32] he says now the outer courts represented
[43:34] justification
[43:39] the which was there water baptism the
[43:41] lever sit out there
[43:43] yes
[43:50] where they washed before they ministered
[43:56] now if you study the tabernacle
[44:01] you can find that the tabernacle is in
[44:03] three uh in three phases
[44:13] and then you have the holy place
[44:16] and then you have the holy of holies
[44:20] now
[44:32] so this republican when he was praying
[44:37] he was praying outside
[44:39] [Music]
[44:41] because the bible says
[44:43] that he would he was so
[44:45] so repentant
[44:48] that he would not even dare to look up
[44:49] to heaven
[44:53] here if we look up
[44:56] we can only see the ceiling
[45:00] in
[45:01] the temple in the temple when they would
[45:03] go into the holy place
[45:06] to the holy place
[45:09] you can only see curtains around you
[45:12] cortinas
[45:13] but you cannot see the sky but
[45:16] so this man the place that he was at
[45:22] he was in the outer courts
[45:25] he was in justification
[45:27] in justification because the bible says
[45:29] that when he humbled himself before the
[45:31] lord
[45:34] and he asked god
[45:36] he has god for uh for mercy
[45:40] jesus said that he was justified
[45:43] jesus
[45:45] so this man was in the outer courts
[45:49] and he was praying
[45:52] and he repented
[45:54] now in the outer courts you have two
[45:56] pieces of furniture and
[46:05] [Music]
[46:08] fuente
[46:14] now brother branham says in the message
[46:16] dedication of building to the lord
[46:23] he says and even the furniture that was
[46:25] inside the walls everything spoke of
[46:27] christ
[46:34] all the furniture in the building typed
[46:36] christ
[46:40] such as the laverne como la fuente where
[46:42] the sacrifice was washed the brass altar
[46:50] where it was slain and burned
[46:54] and the brass even in the altar speaks
[46:57] of judgment divine judgment
[47:03] now the two men that were in the temple
[47:08] they were in the outer courts
[47:11] and both were praying
[47:13] and one man judged himself
[47:18] he judged himself worthy before god
[47:23] but the other man judged himself
[47:26] and he found that he was a sinner and he
[47:28] was asking for mercy in control
[47:33] that's why those two pieces of furniture
[47:35] that are on the outside
[47:51] yourself before god tennis
[47:54] so when you come to the altar
[47:57] you must come with a humble attitude
[48:02] not an arrogant attitude
[48:07] now
[48:08] brother branham says in the exposition
[48:11] of the seven church ages the patmos
[48:13] vision
[48:16] exposition
[48:18] de patmos he says the foundation of the
[48:21] altar of sacrifice was solid brass el
[48:24] fundamento del altar de sacrificio era
[48:26] de bronte solido
[48:28] typifying the lamb's slain from before
[48:30] the foundation of the world typically
[48:37] judgment had already passed upon him
[48:39] when he was yet when as yet there was no
[48:42] sinners
[48:46] decreed
[48:56] now the reason why that that altar was
[48:59] made of brass
[49:15] that's why there's a scripture in the
[49:16] bible
[49:18] that says that jesus christ was the lamb
[49:20] slain from before the foundation of the
[49:23] world
[49:42] lord
[49:44] and it's represented in those two pieces
[49:46] of furniture
[49:50] where it's judgment first you need to
[49:51] judge yourself
[49:55] that's why it says peter says
[50:01] he says repent and be baptized
[50:05] in the name of jesus christ
[50:11] it represents the altar represented
[50:13] and the word baptized
[50:16] represents the lever
[50:18] representative so what peter is saying
[50:20] he's giving you the process
[50:25] he's giving you the process to enter
[50:27] into the temple of the lord
[50:33] because once you understand the
[50:34] furnitures that are in the temple
[50:41] then you can understand different parts
[50:42] of the bible
[50:46] now the altar
[50:48] uh brother branham says in the message
[50:51] he swore by himself
[50:56] he says now brass represents divine
[50:58] judgment
[51:00] representative
[51:02] not earthly judgment
[51:06] or mental judgment or juicio mental but
[51:08] divine judgment
[51:10] divino sees the brass altar the altar
[51:13] where the sacrifices was burnt was made
[51:15] of brass
[51:28] and it means that it was divine
[51:30] insignifica
[51:32] that is where the divine price was paid
[51:35] for
[51:38] now brother branham says in another
[51:40] message he says all things
[51:45] he says that was the lane the lamb for
[51:47] god
[51:48] that was the lamb of god for all of
[51:50] adam's race
[51:55] that takes away the sin of the world
[51:58] soon that lamb was nailed to his altar
[52:01] cross
[52:14] that's why if you ever want to go into
[52:16] the temple of the lord
[52:21] you have for you first have to repent at
[52:23] the altar
[52:26] and you have to accept accept what jesus
[52:29] did for you at the crosstalk
[52:36] so that's why it's the first furniture
[52:38] that's there
[52:43] because for the first thing that any
[52:45] christians should ever do
[52:49] is accept jesus as their savior
[52:54] if they don't do that first part
[52:56] correctly
[53:26] you
[53:32] when you come to the altar
[53:34] and you repent from your heart
[53:38] it doesn't mean that you have the holy
[53:40] ghost yeah
[53:43] it's simply just starting the process
[53:44] for you to get the holy ghost
[53:50] that's why peter said repent and be
[53:52] baptized
[53:56] in the name of jesus christ
[53:58] and he shall receive the gift of the
[54:00] holy spirit
[54:03] it's something that's up ahead in the
[54:04] future
[54:07] now the burning it's uh depending on the
[54:10] person
[54:12] some a person when they repent
[54:16] they can receive the holy ghost
[54:18] immediately
[54:21] one example that i know of unexploded
[54:25] is sister lisa santana
[54:28] santana have you ever heard her
[54:29] testimony
[54:32] testimonial because when you come to the
[54:34] altar
[54:36] you have to repent and you have to
[54:38] confess your sin
[54:42] you have to let go of everything in the
[54:44] world
[54:47] and if and if
[54:49] anyone has ever done anything against
[54:51] you
[54:54] you're even willing to forgive that
[54:56] person
[54:59] because just as christ forgave you
[55:04] so you forgive everyone else
[55:08] and sister lisa is a really good example
[55:10] of someone who receives it immediately
[55:18] if you if you ever get the chance you
[55:19] should hear her testimony
[55:25] because she received it what i believe
[55:26] she received it immediately
[55:28] okay
[55:30] just in one service she got it
[55:37] it took me around 14 15 days
[55:42] uh i had my experience at the altar
[55:46] experience
[55:47] in my room on august 21st
[55:53] and that day i repented of my sins
[55:58] i confess everything that i did wrong yo
[56:00] confessed
[56:02] and i was willing to leave everything
[56:04] behind yo
[56:06] i wasn't going to try to change my own
[56:08] self no intent
[56:11] i knew that god was going to be the one
[56:13] that was going to change me jose
[56:27] they decide to become a christian they
[56:29] see them cristiano because they're
[56:31] either born in the message
[56:36] or maybe they have friends that are part
[56:38] of the message
[56:41] and so they come to church
[56:43] and don't say hello
[56:45] because afterwards they'll hang out with
[56:46] each other
[56:49] but if you really want to be a true
[56:52] christian
[56:55] you have to make a decision for yourself
[57:00] and it's going to be a painful decision
[57:04] when you come to the cross
[57:07] when you come to the altar
[57:09] it's going to be so painful
[57:12] so painful tan doloroso just as it was
[57:15] so painful for jesus when he died
[57:20] and it was it was really it was a really
[57:23] painful decision that he made
[57:27] before he ever went to the cross antes
[57:29] la cruz before he went to the altar
[57:33] he made a decision
[57:34] a decision and because he made that
[57:37] decision
[57:43] many people decide many people say they
[57:46] they're they're christians
[57:49] and they they decide that they will
[57:51] become christians
[58:04] a few issues come up with a with a
[58:05] sister or a brother
[58:13] or sometimes they have issues in their
[58:15] own life
[58:19] and and they say oh god doesn't love me
[58:22] oh yeah
[58:23] because he's letting all these things
[58:24] happen to me
[58:28] you want to know why those things are
[58:29] happening
[58:32] god is testing your decision dios
[58:48] because they're telling god i'll become
[58:50] a christian
[58:52] christian i'll follow you yota
[58:55] and then god begins to test their
[58:57] decision
[59:00] and then they leave him
[59:04] the decision is is the most important
[59:07] thing that you have to make the decision
[59:09] is
[59:11] important
[59:12] it has to be a sincere decision from the
[59:15] heart
[59:18] it doesn't mean that you're born again
[59:20] no significa
[59:21] it just means that you're starting the
[59:23] process and you're willing to go through
[59:25] the process
[59:30] it doesn't matter how much it hurts
[59:34] you have decided that you're going to
[59:36] follow jesus
[59:40] but it's the most important part
[59:44] is that you have to be determined
[59:48] no matter what happens
[59:52] you're going to follow him
[59:54] even though this happens
[59:56] or this happens
[59:58] and this happens
[1:00:12] if god loved you he wouldn't let you go
[1:00:14] through all these things
[1:00:17] but really what god is doing
[1:00:21] he's testing your decision
[1:00:24] we have to be people of our word
[1:00:34] and if it's not easy all the times we're
[1:00:36] still going to follow him
[1:00:42] that's why the altar is the first
[1:00:44] furniture in the temple
[1:00:51] temple
[1:00:52] now for me in my experience
[1:00:54] and the
[1:00:56] i received my uh
[1:00:58] my altar experience
[1:01:02] august 21st
[1:01:05] that day i was i was alone in my house
[1:01:10] and i i
[1:01:11] i got so i had so much conviction
[1:01:15] because i i felt that i left god
[1:01:20] and so that day
[1:01:37] and i started confessing everything
[1:01:40] and i was even determined to do things
[1:01:45] that god wanted me to do
[1:01:47] that i for many years was was so against
[1:01:50] it
[1:01:53] one example is that i i never wanted to
[1:01:55] be a preacher
[1:01:56] [Music]
[1:01:59] and you can ask my parents
[1:02:02] you can ask my friends
[1:02:35] that's different from the people that
[1:02:36] are sitting in the piece
[1:02:40] and i've seen i've seen a lot of that
[1:02:44] so i in my heart for many years john
[1:02:54] and i would always say to myself
[1:02:57] there is no way god can force me to
[1:03:00] become a preacher
[1:03:04] because i'm the one that has to decide
[1:03:06] to come up here and speak before the
[1:03:08] people
[1:03:12] but that day on august 21st
[1:03:16] when i was at the altar
[1:03:19] remember it's something that is ugly
[1:03:24] it's something that's painful yes
[1:03:26] but it's absolutely
[1:03:28] necessary necessary for a christian
[1:03:32] cristiano they first have to come to the
[1:03:34] altar primero
[1:03:36] and die there emory
[1:03:39] now you you die
[1:03:42] on the decision that you make in the
[1:03:44] decision
[1:03:45] you're not born again yeah no it is
[1:03:48] you could be born again in the next few
[1:03:50] minutes
[1:03:54] but the way that you die
[1:03:56] is that you make a decision that you're
[1:03:58] going to die to the world es
[1:04:01] primeramente acer una decision
[1:04:04] that's the most important part for a
[1:04:07] christian yes
[1:04:18] and i was confessing
[1:04:20] and i was willing to do thing i was livi
[1:04:22] i was willing
[1:04:25] to leave things that i knew were not for
[1:04:27] a christian
[1:04:30] christian and lord i i remember i i said
[1:04:33] to the lord
[1:04:36] i said lord i'll i'll serve you ladies
[1:04:42] and then i said i'll even preach if you
[1:04:44] want me too
[1:04:49] that was a really hard decision for me
[1:04:51] this is
[1:04:52] difficult for me because i was so
[1:04:54] against it
[1:04:57] i never liked the worship that a
[1:04:59] minister receives
[1:05:03] just because you're a minister
[1:05:06] the people treat you even more special
[1:05:08] than a normal person that's sitting in
[1:05:10] the pews
[1:05:12] person
[1:05:14] and i i never really liked that i mean
[1:05:17] and so i never want and i don't like
[1:05:18] receiving attention
[1:05:20] you
[1:05:32] but i said lord if you want me to i'll
[1:05:33] i'll even preach if you want perro
[1:05:38] because in that year and even in the
[1:05:41] years before that
[1:05:45] i i would have an anointing that would
[1:05:47] come upon me
[1:05:48] i mean
[1:06:01] i knew i wasn't living right
[1:06:05] and i didn't want to become a preacher
[1:06:08] so i said i'm not going to do it
[1:06:10] and there was a lot of people that would
[1:06:12] ask me emmanuel
[1:06:13] why don't you preach
[1:06:17] even brother johnny would ask me and i
[1:06:18] would say no brother johnny it's not for
[1:06:20] me
[1:06:24] brother johnny one time uh we were in
[1:06:26] the office
[1:06:30] he would uh
[1:06:31] saturday nights he would stay up really
[1:06:33] late studying for his messages
[1:06:40] sometimes i would receive his notes like
[1:06:41] at three or four in the morning
[1:06:46] and so one day he walks in and i'm
[1:06:48] already in the office
[1:06:53] and he's he sits down and he and he says
[1:06:56] oh i don't want to preach today he says
[1:07:01] and then he looks at me hilo memira and
[1:07:03] he says emmanuel what would you do
[1:07:07] if me and you we go up to the to the
[1:07:09] pulpit
[1:07:12] and then
[1:07:13] i would say you know what brothers i'm
[1:07:14] not going to preach today
[1:07:18] emanuel is going to preach for you today
[1:07:21] what would you do emmanuel
[1:07:24] because after i say that i'll walk down
[1:07:42] so that was a really hard decision for
[1:07:43] me to make santos
[1:07:47] so my experience at the altar
[1:07:50] experience
[1:07:51] was on august 21st
[1:07:54] because remember you have to be sincere
[1:07:57] when you make your decision
[1:08:01] so that day was a friday so i said
[1:08:04] so i had that that experience in the
[1:08:06] morning at noon so this is
[1:08:22] and
[1:08:26] he was revealing a lot of the things
[1:08:29] that i said in my prayers
[1:08:34] and i was right next to him
[1:08:39] i was thinking how do you know all that
[1:08:41] just happened
[1:08:43] you weren't there
[1:08:45] i was just by myself how do you know
[1:08:47] that yo
[1:08:49] so i knew it was god talking because he
[1:08:51] wasn't there
[1:08:56] so he began to say a lot of the things
[1:08:58] that i said in my prayer entonces
[1:09:02] so that caught my attention
[1:09:06] and then luis said something that that i
[1:09:08] knew was my answer
[1:09:12] and that answer was yes
[1:09:16] sincere
[1:09:18] sincero you have to be sincere
[1:09:22] and it's going to hurt a lot
[1:09:25] it's really going to be painful
[1:09:28] the more you go into the world
[1:09:31] when god calls you
[1:09:33] it's gonna it's really gonna hurt to
[1:09:35] leave everything that you liked in the
[1:09:36] world
[1:09:40] but it's something that's absolutely
[1:09:43] necessary
[1:09:46] god looks at your decision
[1:09:49] he doesn't look at the sin that you made
[1:09:54] he sees the decision that you make el
[1:09:56] mirola
[1:09:59] that's why with the two men foreign
[1:10:04] [Music]
[1:10:28] you remember brother branham
[1:10:31] before he started his new ministry
[1:10:35] he he had that experience with that with
[1:10:37] the angel at the cave
[1:10:42] and one thing that the angel told him
[1:10:46] is that you have to be sincere when you
[1:10:49] pray
[1:10:53] i've never said this before but i'll say
[1:10:55] it today
[1:11:09] and brother branham talks about when
[1:11:10] that angel when was talking with him in
[1:11:13] the cave
[1:11:16] the angel was telling him the different
[1:11:18] signs that he was going to have in his
[1:11:19] ministry
[1:11:24] the first one was going to be the sign
[1:11:25] in the hand
[1:11:28] and and then he says the next one is
[1:11:29] that he was going to be able to discern
[1:11:31] the hearts
[1:11:36] and brother branham says
[1:11:50] so in my experience
[1:11:52] told me
[1:12:06] yet
[1:12:08] with sister lisa it happened like this
[1:12:13] but with me it took me around two weeks
[1:12:21] september the 5th
[1:12:23] of september
[1:12:25] there's a park
[1:12:26] near my house
[1:12:30] it has a it has a tall wall
[1:12:35] and what i would do for years
[1:12:38] i would go to that park and hear tapes
[1:12:44] i would i would i would do it for hours
[1:12:47] just to study english and spanish
[1:12:52] just to become a better interpreter
[1:12:56] and then to be able to do some exercises
[1:13:01] so that day on the fifth yard
[1:13:05] cinco uh that day was a saturday yes
[1:13:09] that day um me and joshua alvarado were
[1:13:12] going to go to a service
[1:13:17] with brother bob willard
[1:13:19] hermano bob willard he was having
[1:13:21] special services
[1:13:24] but before
[1:13:25] before we went to the services
[1:13:29] uh i went to that park yofia
[1:13:32] and in that park i was listening to
[1:13:34] tapes
[1:13:36] and as i was listening to the tapes
[1:13:40] the the second tape that i listened to
[1:13:44] is called the sign of the messiah
[1:13:47] and if you study the message he says
[1:13:50] the sign of the messiah
[1:13:53] is revealing the secrets of the heart
[1:13:59] and so when i was there
[1:14:02] i stopped playing
[1:14:03] yo deje de jugar and i sat under a tree
[1:14:06] ima center back
[1:14:09] and i just started listening to brother
[1:14:10] branham he commented
[1:14:17] that desire was that i i wanted to be
[1:14:19] discerned
[1:14:23] i wanted brother banham to talk to me
[1:14:27] so what i did is i sat down
[1:14:29] right under that tree entonces
[1:14:34] and then brother branham he just said
[1:14:36] when when someone is discerned
[1:14:40] personally
[1:14:55] and god simply would use brother branham
[1:14:57] he did implement
[1:14:59] to talk to them very quickly
[1:15:03] and they would finally get their answer
[1:15:07] after many years of waiting
[1:15:12] so i had been waiting for a lot of years
[1:15:14] entonces
[1:15:16] for five years actually for cinco anos
[1:15:19] so that day brother bannon he's he's
[1:15:21] discerning people entonces elementary
[1:15:30] he's almost towards the end of the tape
[1:15:33] yes
[1:15:35] and he says he says i see a man praying
[1:15:38] sincerely
[1:15:44] he says standing there he's a preacher
[1:15:50] so i knew that was my answer
[1:15:53] because that was the decision i made
[1:15:55] just a few weeks before
[1:16:00] this is really important the decision
[1:16:02] that you make
[1:16:03] important
[1:16:05] to assess if your decision isn't right
[1:16:07] [Music]
[1:16:09] if your decision is not made
[1:16:12] on the basis that you want to follow
[1:16:14] christ
[1:16:20] and then it's not a right decision
[1:16:23] correct if you just say i'm going to
[1:16:25] become a christian
[1:16:28] christian just because you felt the
[1:16:31] presence of the lord no masculinity
[1:17:01] whether you feel the presence of the
[1:17:03] lord
[1:17:06] or whether you feel the presence of the
[1:17:07] devil in your life
[1:17:10] because when you make a decision
[1:17:14] the devil makes a decision
[1:17:18] he's going to start attacking your mind
[1:17:23] so that day
[1:17:25] brother branham said i see a man praying
[1:17:28] sincerely
[1:17:40] [Music]
[1:17:43] but as soon as you said the word
[1:17:44] sincerely
[1:17:48] i didn't have time to think you know
[1:17:51] my body just reacted
[1:17:54] reaction i started crying come and see
[1:18:01] i've never cried like that in all my
[1:18:03] life
[1:18:06] i was
[1:18:07] the tape was already over la cinta
[1:18:09] terminado and i was still crying for
[1:18:11] like 10 more minutes
[1:18:16] it was so ugly estaba
[1:18:18] but that is the most beautiful
[1:18:20] experience i've ever had
[1:18:26] so don't be ashamed
[1:18:30] to let god touch you okay
[1:18:35] because when he touches you
[1:18:37] you might cry
[1:18:53] ugly is that unfair
[1:18:54] but you need that experience
[1:18:58] so that day when he said when he said i
[1:19:00] see a man praying sincerely
[1:19:07] my body just simply reacted my cuerpos
[1:19:10] implemented
[1:19:12] i started crying and crying and crying
[1:19:16] i had mucus coming out of my nose
[1:19:19] i had to go around the tree and blow out
[1:19:21] the bloated mucus
[1:19:25] and then i
[1:19:26] i had no more tears
[1:19:29] i said oh thank god i'm not gonna cry
[1:19:31] anymore
[1:19:34] and then the tears will come back again
[1:19:38] that that experience lasted about 20 25
[1:19:42] minutes yes
[1:19:45] and i had nothing to do with it
[1:19:48] so
[1:20:02] i had my experience in the holy of
[1:20:04] holies
[1:20:10] but it's all based on your decision
[1:20:15] you have to make a decision
[1:20:17] a decision not on emotions
[1:20:23] that's where a lot of people make that
[1:20:25] mistake
[1:20:27] there's so many people
[1:20:30] just because they felt the presence of
[1:20:32] the lord at church
[1:20:36] or the the song that was sung was so
[1:20:39] beautiful
[1:20:42] or the preacher
[1:20:43] he what he said was so awesome
[1:20:49] people people decide to become
[1:20:52] christians
[1:20:55] based on the wrong decision
[1:20:58] embarrassed
[1:21:12] you have to decide that you're going to
[1:21:14] follow him
[1:21:16] in the good times
[1:21:18] buenos and more importantly in the bad
[1:21:20] times
[1:21:23] because as soon as as soon as a little
[1:21:25] problem comes up
[1:21:40] it's god testing your decision
[1:21:44] to decision we have to be like ruth the
[1:21:46] name
[1:21:47] of ruth ruth
[1:21:48] she made a decision one day
[1:21:51] una decision that she was going to leave
[1:21:53] her entire world behind her
[1:21:58] and she told her mother-in-law
[1:22:01] he says wherever you go i'll go
[1:22:04] boy wherever you die i will die
[1:22:07] says your god will be my god
[1:22:15] said that she was justified in when she
[1:22:17] made that decision
[1:22:22] she didn't receive
[1:22:24] what we could say the baptism of the
[1:22:26] holy ghost until later on
[1:22:31] because it was only a type in the
[1:22:33] natural porque
[1:22:34] typical
[1:22:35] but brother adam says when she made her
[1:22:37] decision she was justified
[1:22:43] she wasn't born again
[1:22:45] so when you're when you make
[1:22:47] your decisions sincerely from your heart
[1:22:50] conotus
[1:23:02] because he knows that you're committing
[1:23:04] sin elsa
[1:23:32] to
[1:23:46] if you make the right decision
[1:23:50] then god will guide you to the next
[1:23:51] stage
[1:23:56] and then because you made the right
[1:23:58] decision
[1:24:00] then god will guide you to
[1:24:02] to the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:24:07] that's where a lot of people make their
[1:24:08] mistake
[1:24:11] they come to the altar
[1:24:14] based on emotions
[1:24:17] not a decision
[1:24:20] remember there was two women
[1:24:23] it was ruth
[1:24:24] and orfa
[1:24:28] both of them were crying
[1:24:31] both of them were were having emotions
[1:24:35] because they just lost all the men in
[1:24:37] their family
[1:24:38] junta avian peridot
[1:24:44] and then orf and then uh naomi logo
[1:24:46] naomi started to test their decision
[1:24:52] they said we'll go with you we'll go
[1:24:54] we'll go with you
[1:24:57] that's what they said
[1:24:59] but then naomi said no no that's fine
[1:25:01] you can go back to your land
[1:25:07] and so orpha
[1:25:09] decided okay that's fine i'll go back to
[1:25:10] my land
[1:25:15] only had emotions
[1:25:19] ruth had more than just emotions
[1:25:24] ruth made a clear decision
[1:25:32] he says wherever you go i'll go hey yo
[1:25:36] whatever you eat i'll eat lo que tu
[1:25:38] comas
[1:25:52] it's going to be a painful process
[1:25:55] it's going to be really painful for you
[1:25:58] but in your heart
[1:26:01] you have a determination of
[1:26:03] determination to keep going forward
[1:26:07] if that decision is the right one
[1:26:11] that you're willing to be a christian
[1:26:14] christian and you're willing to follow
[1:26:16] christ
[1:26:21] and even though there's problems along
[1:26:23] the way
[1:26:26] he's going to take you from
[1:26:27] justification to sanctification
[1:26:31] and then he's going to take you from
[1:26:32] sanctification to the baptism of the
[1:26:34] holy ghost
[1:26:47] that's that's really what i to what i
[1:26:49] want to emphasize
[1:26:53] the decision
[1:26:54] cause i had i had a lot of notes
[1:26:57] and i haven't even touched them
[1:27:01] because that altar
[1:27:03] is a is a painful altar
[1:27:08] it's an ugly altar
[1:27:11] that altered the brass altar
[1:27:14] it speaks of the cross
[1:27:16] and where jesus when he died at the
[1:27:18] cross
[1:27:21] it was the most horrible thing that you
[1:27:23] could see
[1:27:26] it was absolutely necessary it
[1:27:28] absolutely necessary because he shed his
[1:27:56] and then he's going to start using you
[1:27:58] to help
[1:28:12] judgment
[1:28:14] you judge yourself by the word
[1:28:19] and then you you find that you're a
[1:28:20] sinner
[1:28:22] you humble yourself before the lord
[1:28:26] and
[1:28:53] remember god can see the future record
[1:28:56] and god knows your decision is true
[1:29:02] so god can see that in the future
[1:29:06] when the problems begin to come con
[1:29:08] problems
[1:29:09] you can in your mind you can go back to
[1:29:11] that day that you have that experience
[1:29:16] and you say no i decided that i was
[1:29:18] going to be with him
[1:29:21] i decided that i'm gonna follow him
[1:29:25] but it's all based on that decision
[1:29:29] if you don't make the right decision
[1:29:34] then you yourself you're gonna want to
[1:29:35] go to sanctification
[1:29:40] but you're going to be like that
[1:29:42] pharisee
[1:29:47] you're going to be arrogant
[1:29:51] a few weeks ago we played a tape
[1:29:55] brother talks about how uh he he would
[1:29:58] always have these thoughts am i serving
[1:30:00] the lord correctly
[1:30:10] i don't know have any of you had those
[1:30:12] thoughts before
[1:30:15] ever since i had my experience there's a
[1:30:18] question
[1:30:31] i've been able to see things in the
[1:30:33] message
[1:30:36] and in the bible
[1:30:38] that years before i was never able to
[1:30:40] see okay
[1:30:42] but yet
[1:30:44] the devil attacks me every
[1:30:53] [Music]
[1:31:00] haven't received the baptism of the holy
[1:31:02] spirit
[1:31:05] that's what he tells me
[1:31:07] you're not born again
[1:31:10] that's why you can see all these things
[1:31:12] in the message is
[1:31:30] because i can see the world that i was
[1:31:32] living in
[1:31:36] i could see all the different things
[1:31:37] that were happening to me
[1:31:40] i said you know what he's probably right
[1:31:45] so for a few months i was doubting
[1:31:47] myself
[1:31:51] i was thinking did god make me go
[1:31:53] through all that
[1:31:54] stuff
[1:32:08] why am i struggling in my mind like this
[1:32:10] is
[1:32:32] foreign
[1:32:53] and i tell the devil
[1:32:55] diablo
[1:32:55] [Music]
[1:32:57] okay he did take me to sanctification
[1:33:01] but i promised him that i would serve
[1:33:03] him
[1:33:06] even though i'm in sanctification
[1:33:10] i'm still gonna serve him
[1:33:13] and one day he's gonna take me to the
[1:33:14] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:33:19] it's all based on your decision
[1:33:26] even though the devil can lie to you
[1:33:31] and he can make you believe
[1:33:34] that you're not in the stage where you
[1:33:36] really are yeah
[1:33:41] you can go back to the decision that you
[1:33:43] made one day
[1:33:48] i
[1:33:55] so even though i'm not where i should be
[1:33:59] i'm gonna keep going
[1:34:04] that's why that decision is so important
[1:34:10] because the devil will come and he will
[1:34:11] play with your mind
[1:34:14] he's going to come bring he's going to
[1:34:16] bring message quotes
[1:34:20] he's going to he's going to tell you
[1:34:21] scriptures of the bible
[1:34:24] and he's going to tell you see the bible
[1:34:25] says this
[1:34:29] the message says
[1:34:43] [Music]
[1:34:44] even though the devil every day he comes
[1:34:46] and attacks you
[1:34:52] that's why that altar
[1:34:57] is the first furniture in the temple
[1:35:02] because you have to accept what jesus
[1:35:04] did for you
[1:35:07] and you have to be so determined
[1:35:12] that you're gonna keep going forward
[1:35:17] it's all based on your decision estate
[1:35:26] brother branham had a lot of
[1:35:27] difficulties in his life
[1:35:31] he disobeyed god
[1:35:33] and god took away his his wife and his
[1:35:36] daughter
[1:35:39] and he even wanted to take his own life
[1:35:44] but god wouldn't let him
[1:35:48] but he made a decision one day that he
[1:35:50] was going to follow jesus
[1:35:55] you have to keep moving forward
[1:35:59] because it's it's a really painful
[1:36:02] process
[1:36:04] it's going to hurt you so bad
[1:36:08] just like i heard jesus
[1:36:11] christ before he got to the cross
[1:36:14] they were spitting on him
[1:36:16] they were torturing him
[1:36:18] they put a crown of thorns on his head
[1:36:22] the spinas but he made a decision
[1:36:27] he says lord if it's possible
[1:36:31] let this cup pass from me okay
[1:36:35] but let your will be done
[1:36:40] jesus made a decision one day jesus
[1:36:43] and even though he suffered so much
[1:36:47] and it was so painful for him yesterday
[1:36:50] he was able to save us because of it
[1:36:54] you you can only see what's going around
[1:36:56] you right now
[1:37:00] you can't see the future
[1:37:03] but god is bringing you right now to the
[1:37:05] altar
[1:37:09] he's he's trying to force you to make a
[1:37:11] decision
[1:37:14] and sometimes he'll even let you be so
[1:37:17] close to death
[1:37:31] that's why it's gonna hurt you so bad
[1:37:35] it's going to be so painful
[1:37:37] but just keep going forward
[1:37:42] don't make your decision
[1:37:45] just because you felt the anointing
[1:37:51] don't make your decision no decision
[1:37:54] just because you had an emotion
[1:37:57] because you spoke in tongues
[1:37:59] because you were crying
[1:38:02] make a decision
[1:38:05] because you simply want to follow him
[1:38:10] and you love him
[1:38:14] just keep moving forward
[1:38:17] many of you can please stand in the
[1:38:19] piano
[1:38:30] brother branham he talks about how
[1:38:32] people come to the altar
[1:38:34] at the church
[1:38:39] he says he doesn't like to make an altar
[1:38:41] call
[1:38:42] it
[1:38:47] he himself said that most likely in the
[1:38:49] future he would make an altar
[1:38:55] because when a minister is trying to
[1:38:57] force you to the altar
[1:39:03] he's trying to base it on emotions
[1:39:09] he's trying to base it well all
[1:39:24] an altar of decision
[1:39:28] now if you listen to brother bannon's
[1:39:29] messages
[1:39:32] when he's praying for people and
[1:39:34] discerning them
[1:39:37] sometimes he has the people right there
[1:39:41] he has them right there in the altar
[1:39:44] but then sometimes he can see that he
[1:39:46] says that light
[1:39:47] yeah
[1:39:49] that light of that angel
[1:39:52] is is going towards the audience
[1:39:56] so it doesn't really matter if you come
[1:39:58] here or you're over there
[1:40:04] it's your faith
[1:40:06] and it's your decision
[1:40:10] i know i know of sisters here yo conosco
[1:40:13] de hermanas aqui
[1:40:14] that were praying for a baby
[1:40:18] and they received
[1:40:20] they received an experience right in the
[1:40:22] pews
[1:40:25] it was right it was based on their
[1:40:27] decision
[1:40:30] they said they felt the fire of god
[1:40:35] one sister one of them was on this side
[1:40:40] and the other one was on this side
[1:40:42] and one felt it
[1:40:44] she was praying for a baby
[1:40:47] and the baby is not born
[1:40:50] and now the other one pray for and she's
[1:40:51] over there
[1:40:54] and now she's pregnant
[1:40:56] but it's it's based on a painful
[1:40:59] decision
[1:41:02] it's going to hurt you so bad
[1:41:05] but it's absolutely necessary but it is
[1:41:09] necessary
[1:41:14] let's bar hats
[1:41:15] including
[1:41:23] lord jesus christ
[1:41:28] we want to confess our sins
[1:41:39] amen
[1:41:42] we don't deserve your grace
[1:41:44] to gracias
[1:41:56] so lord let us make a decision tonight

[1:42:19] decision
[1:42:24] we have to make the decision
[1:42:26] [Music]
[1:42:34] [Music]
[1:42:40] but we have a decision that we have to
[1:42:42] make
[1:42:44] a decision
[1:42:45] that we're going to follow
[1:42:48] even when we feel the presence of the
[1:42:50] devil
[1:42:53] and the devil's tempting us
[1:43:06] [Music]
[1:43:22] and then god you took you took care of
[1:43:24] the rest
[1:43:26] of us help us lord to make a decision
[1:43:33] every day
[1:43:35] even though everything is against us
[1:43:39] even though the devil comes in our mind
[1:43:43] and he tells us that he doesn't love you
[1:43:47] why is he letting you go through this
[1:43:50] we
[1:44:04] and i'ma keep serving
[1:44:13] [Music]

[1:44:21] because they're living everything that
[1:44:23] they loved in the world
[1:44:27] but there's so much that you want to
[1:44:28] give us
[1:44:33] help them make the decision for the
[1:44:36] right reason
