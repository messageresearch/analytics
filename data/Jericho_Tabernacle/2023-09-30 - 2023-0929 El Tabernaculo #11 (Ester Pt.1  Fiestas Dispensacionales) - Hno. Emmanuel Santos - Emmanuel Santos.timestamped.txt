[33:39] power that you've given us yes
[33:45] [Music]
[33:52] personal
[33:58] [Music]
[34:00] ity
[34:05] in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen
[34:09] uh
[34:13] standing I like to read one portion of
[34:15] the Bible is
[34:23] chapter 1 verse 1 to 3.
[34:27] [Music]
[34:28] since
[34:33] you can say Amen once you have it
[34:36] foreign
[34:40] [Music]
[34:57] this is a Suarez which rain from India
[35:00] even on to Ethiopia over 107 and 20
[35:04] provinces
[35:13] that in those days when the king of
[35:15] Suarez sat on the throne of his kingdom
[35:17] which was in shusan the palace
[35:21] is
[35:31] the third year of his Reign he made a
[35:34] feast onto all the prince princes and
[35:36] his servants of the power of Persia and
[35:38] media the Nobles and princes of the
[35:39] promises being before him
[35:48] as well
[35:57] [Music]
[36:03] and originally I had another thought uh
[36:08] but to begin I want to speak about this
[36:14] the subject is concerning Esther is
[36:19] and it's the dispensational feast uh
[36:23] is
[37:24] and at that time it was the Jews that
[37:26] were found under that law
[37:29] [Music]
[37:40] it says now it came to pass in the days
[37:42] of a Suarez this is a Suarez which rain
[37:45] from India even on to Ethiopia
[37:48] in the next image I have a photo okay
[37:53] where it shows where it's India where is
[37:55] India Indonesia Ethiopia and we're in
[37:57] Ethiopia is
[38:01] you see that India is found on the
[38:03] eastern part of the world
[38:05] Ethiopia and to go to Ethiopia
[38:10] one has to travel to the west of the
[38:13] world
[38:14] so the reign of this king is
[38:18] when from the East to the West
[38:40] it first rises in the East and sets on
[38:43] the west
[38:44] now follow me close
[38:48] civilization has traveled con El Sol
[38:51] with the sun
[38:52] we all know that it is
[39:04] I came from the east across over into
[39:06] Germany
[39:08] across the Mediterranean
[39:11] into Germany
[39:15] from Germany across the English Channel
[39:17] English into England
[39:21] from there across the Atlantic
[39:24] into United States
[39:33] now the East and the West has met
[39:51] the gospel also travels from the East to
[39:54] the West
[39:57] we are found in the western part of the
[39:59] world
[40:01] it started in the East
[40:05] principlements the people that we know
[40:07] that live in the eastern part of the
[40:09] world
[40:10] which the Bible speaks about
[40:13] there are the Jews
[40:17] so this King had a feast
[40:20] so in Esther one two this
[40:24] is
[40:34] in the third year of his Reigns Feast
[40:37] onto all the princes and servants the
[40:39] power of Persian media the Nobles and
[40:41] princes of the promises being before him
[40:52] and his Nobles
[41:00] the strongman of his of his reign
[41:05] the power of that rain
[41:10] so that the gospel began with the Jews
[41:15] we know the Jews come from the nation of
[41:17] Israel
[41:19] how many you know of Jacob okay
[41:22] and his name was changed to Israel
[41:26] and the scripture Genesis 32 28. if you
[41:30] have your Bible today is
[41:35] going to read several scriptures
[41:39] Genesis 32 28 this is
[41:49] Thy Name shall be called No More Jacob
[41:51] but Israel for as a prince has thou
[41:53] power with God and with men and has
[41:55] prevailed
[41:57] see the name is
[42:03] and has power with God says
[42:08] is the first seal this is
[42:14] but one night he caught on hold of
[42:16] something real yes
[42:18] and he knows that it was something
[42:19] realism
[42:22] and he stayed with it and held until he
[42:25] overcome until you overcome
[42:29] his name was changed to Israel
[42:34] meaning a prince with power before God
[42:37] is
[42:40] so the first Feast that this King had is
[42:45] the most powerful men with in his Reigns
[42:50] when God started the kingdomen he
[42:53] started with Israel with the nation
[43:14] remember the servants has always been
[43:17] God's servants is the Jews
[43:20] Abraham was a servant Los Angeles the
[43:23] Gentiles are not the servants it's the
[43:26] brideos it's a son this is the sun the
[43:31] churches
[43:32] the Jews are the servants
[43:38] it was the Nobles of his Reigns
[43:42] remember keep your your the Bible at
[43:45] your hand
[43:46] Exodus 24 9.
[44:00] and seven of the Elders of Israel
[44:03] is
[44:12] and they saw that the god of Israel and
[44:14] there was under his feet as they were
[44:16] paved the work of a sapphire stone as
[44:18] they were the body of heaven and his
[44:20] clearness
[44:23] principles
[44:27] and upon the Nobles of the children of
[44:29] Israel he laid not his hand also they
[44:32] saw God and did eat and drink
[44:37] in Spanish it says that the powers of
[44:39] the of the men or the princes of of
[44:41] Israel in English
[44:46] and in English is the noble men of
[44:49] Israel
[44:50] Fiesta so when that first
[44:59] [Music]
[45:18] the Jews are the first one to receive
[45:20] the Gospel
[45:38] and be there and I will give thee tables
[45:40] of stone and the law and Commandments
[45:42] which I have written and thou mayest
[45:44] teach them
[45:47] we're reading a lot about Moses in the
[45:50] wilderness
[45:52] and we're reading that that type of the
[45:55] first Feast that this King had
[45:58] when Moses went to Pharaoh is
[46:02] these are the words that he said unto
[46:04] pharaoh and exodus in Exodus 5 1. this
[46:07] is
[46:19] and afterwards Moses and Aaron went in
[46:21] and told Pharaoh thus said to the Lord
[46:23] God of Israel let my people go that they
[46:25] may hold a feast unto me in the
[46:27] wilderness
[46:30] what type of feast was this
[46:37] when the King has its first Feast
[46:43] tells us the reason why he had this
[46:48] feasters
[46:55] when they show The Riches of his
[46:57] glorious Kingdom in the honor of his
[46:59] excellent Majesty many days and even 104
[47:02] score days
[47:04] so if someone reads the scripture in a
[47:07] superficial way
[47:09] you might think that this king is is
[47:12] boasting
[47:13] foreign
[48:37] he said he was going to harden Pharaoh's
[48:40] heart
[49:16] and there was Darkness all over the
[49:19] kingdom there was light in Goshen
[49:53] even though they're found in a place
[49:55] called The Wilderness
[50:01] and if a snake was to be in the
[50:04] wilderness
[50:05] and that snake was to bite you God told
[50:09] Moses
[50:10] this is lift up that brass
[50:14] serpentes whoever that looks upon that
[50:16] breast surface
[50:20] the time came when they were thirsty
[50:40] in this Exodus
[50:45] it was God preaching them the gospel
[50:49] is
[50:51] in the book of Galatians 3 78 this is
[50:59] which are of Faith the same are the
[51:01] children of Abraham located
[51:08] and the scripture foreseen that God
[51:09] would justify the Heathen through faith
[51:14] preach before the gospel unto abrahamas
[51:17] in English
[51:20] and it says in English He preached the
[51:22] gospel
[51:24] and the gospel is not just words
[51:28] it's a demonstration of God's power
[51:32] so when God preached to Abraham he said
[51:36] you should have a son
[51:38] not only did he say it to him
[51:44] with the power of His glory
[51:48] to show him that he does what he says
[51:55] it's the Feast of the Gospel
[51:59] preaching regards of his kingdom
[52:04] and it was only for Israel
[52:09] also in Psalms 145 verse 9 it says
[52:17] the Lord is good to all and his Tender
[52:20] Mercies are over all his words
[52:24] all thy works are praise thee O Lord and
[52:27] thy Saint shall bless thee La Gloria
[52:31] that shall speak of the glory of that
[52:33] Kingdom and talk of thy power Los
[52:36] Angeles
[52:40] to make known the sons of the men of his
[52:43] mighty acts and the Glorious Majesty of
[52:45] his kingdom
[52:47] is
[52:50] the kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom
[52:53] and thy Dominion under withdrawal
[52:54] Generations
[52:56] so God wants to show the gospel
[53:00] he wanted to preach them the gospel
[53:03] showing them that there's no God so
[53:06] great as he is there is
[53:16] no one else that can heal you
[53:18] like he can heal you know
[53:22] they will take care of you more better
[53:25] than he can yeah
[53:27] it was him preaching the gospel
[53:31] showing the power that he has
[53:37] Abraham's Covenant
[53:42] in the beginning he was
[53:47] self-existing one
[53:50] and him was attributes to be a father to
[53:53] be a savior to be a Healer yes
[53:59] all these things only display for his
[54:01] attributes
[54:03] see that's what it is
[54:16] because God is an object of worship
[54:22] so he created angels so he could be God
[54:25] is
[54:28] and then he put man on free moral Agency
[54:31] for his own Holiness
[54:39] Salvador then he became a savior
[54:44] he's just displaying his attributes
[54:48] is the king showing in this Feast
[54:52] the glory of his Reigns
[54:55] God's showing his powers there's not no
[54:58] other God like me
[55:01] all right
[55:02] and Romanos and Romans
[55:05] chapter 9.
[55:09] speaking again about Moses he said
[55:13] Romans 9 15. this is
[55:22] Mercy on whom I will have mercy in our
[55:25] compassion whom I will have compassion
[55:31] so then it's not of him that willeth nor
[55:34] of him that runeth but of God that
[55:36] showeth Mercy
[55:38] for the scripture says
[55:45] for this same purpose I have raised the
[55:48] up that I might show my my power
[55:52] and that my name might be declared
[55:54] through all the Earth
[55:57] why is
[56:00] let all this happen in Exodus
[56:05] to show The Riches of his power of His
[56:09] Reign is
[56:10] the same thing this King did and it's
[56:13] Supreme and supreme in this first Feast
[56:16] it was the Feast of the Gospel
[56:18] Israel
[56:57] notorious
[57:36] what if God willing to show his wrath
[57:38] and or to make his power known
[57:45] endured with much long-suffering the
[57:47] vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction
[57:52] that he might make known The Riches of
[57:54] his glory
[57:59] Gloria on the vessels of Mercy which has
[58:02] been prepared unto Glory
[58:05] esto is
[58:10] called not of the Jews only but also of
[58:13] the Gentiles
[58:15] you can see that Paul speaks speaks
[58:19] about Moses and Pharaoh he loses
[58:22] and it types both as one of honor and
[58:25] one of dishonors
[58:32] through these vessels
[58:35] to show the power of his glory
[58:38] celebrated but then in verse 24 it says
[58:47] because even us whom he had called not
[58:50] of the Jews only but also of the
[58:52] Gentiles
[58:54] because the gospel travels from the East
[58:57] to the west
[59:01] to you Los cantiles to the Gentiles
[59:05] so God in his first Feast is
[59:12] the gospel
[59:15] but this King had another Feast
[59:18] one five
[59:35] these days were expired the king made a
[59:37] feast onto all the people that were
[59:39] present in Suzanne the palace both on to
[59:42] Great and Small seven days in the court
[59:43] of the garden of the king's Palace
[59:48] so the the list of the people who are
[59:50] invited is
[59:52] from the the greatest to the smallest
[59:55] you remember about Peter
[59:58] when he told them
[1:00:00] what must we do
[1:00:04] Peter said unto them repent to be
[1:00:06] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:00:10] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:00:12] Holy Ghost yes
[1:00:24] it's for whosoever from the from the
[1:00:28] greatest to the smallest
[1:00:35] is invited to the second feast
[1:01:05] when it begins to describe the garden
[1:01:08] this is
[1:01:24] a white green blue hangings fasting with
[1:01:26] cords of fine linen and purple and
[1:01:28] silver rings and pillars of marble the
[1:01:30] beds were of gold and silver silver upon
[1:01:33] a pavement of red and blue and white and
[1:01:35] black and marble
[1:01:37] the first thing
[1:01:42] this pavement had several colors
[1:01:46] the first one was white then green then
[1:01:51] blue yeah and brother Rams tells us
[1:01:55] these colors have uh significance
[1:02:01] he says in Hebrews chapter 7 part two
[1:02:03] this is
[1:02:07] how we've had time to to give those
[1:02:10] colors
[1:02:13] to show that each one of those colors
[1:02:15] represents God's Purity amen
[1:02:19] those colors there are seven natural
[1:02:22] colors
[1:02:24] those colors represents the purity of
[1:02:26] God is
[1:02:29] these colors represent the motors of God
[1:02:32] and the attitude of God
[1:02:41] begins to describe the different colors
[1:02:43] that were in this Garden in primeros
[1:02:45] Blanco the first one is
[1:02:50] pureness
[1:02:52] this is the green representative it
[1:02:55] represents life it is
[1:02:59] represents the trueness
[1:03:02] and a perfect Fellowship
[1:03:07] and then we go back to the first Feast
[1:03:11] it was a feast that God had
[1:03:14] with the Jews
[1:03:18] remember what we read in Exodus
[1:03:23] when God calls Moses
[1:03:28] Moses and Aaron and two other men
[1:03:32] and then 70 elders
[1:03:39] but not everyone was able to reach the
[1:03:42] top of the mountain
[1:03:44] only Moses was able to get up there
[1:03:48] because he got up there to receive the
[1:03:50] laws the Commandments
[1:03:53] but when they were down there on the
[1:03:55] earth
[1:03:57] they saw that up there in heaven
[1:04:01] in English you said there was a pavement
[1:04:04] they saw God's feet
[1:04:07] like a pavement of sapphire
[1:04:12] but that's under the law
[1:04:36] has gone up to heaven
[1:04:40] but he that is descended from heaven
[1:04:45] and quickly he speaks about his
[1:04:47] crucifixion
[1:04:48] and we go back to Moses
[1:04:52] he said that no one can go up there only
[1:04:56] Moses
[1:04:59] they were able to see the pavement on
[1:05:01] that rock
[1:05:04] but we are no longer under the law
[1:05:07] when a person diesel they do go to
[1:05:10] heaven
[1:05:44] where since we were white green and blue
[1:05:46] hangings fasting with cords of Finland
[1:05:49] and purple to silver rings and pillows
[1:05:51] of marble the beds were of gold and
[1:05:53] silver upon a pavement of red and blue
[1:05:55] and white and black marble in English
[1:05:59] once again in English it says
[1:06:02] this is a pavement upon a pavement that
[1:06:05] there was
[1:06:23] they're walking upon the pavement
[1:06:29] when a Christian is born again
[1:06:32] he has the capacity
[1:06:35] to go to Heavenly places
[1:06:38] in Christ Jesus
[1:06:41] you have the opportunity
[1:06:44] you don't literally just go up there but
[1:06:47] brother Ram says
[1:06:49] that were found in Heavenly places
[1:06:53] it says our position that we have
[1:06:57] in the body of Christ
[1:06:59] you as a Christian
[1:07:01] born again
[1:07:06] the Feast of Greece
[1:07:09] you have the capacity
[1:07:11] to go up to Heavenly places
[1:07:15] to walk upon the God's pavement
[1:07:46] has the capacity to go to Heavenly
[1:07:49] places and you as a Believer your faith
[1:07:53] is
[1:07:56] to be able to walk upon that pavement
[1:08:12] and the foundation was also part of
[1:08:14] marble
[1:08:17] all right
[1:08:21] says the next position of the seven
[1:08:23] Church ages
[1:08:27] now he's going to make the Overcomer a
[1:08:29] pillar in that Temple but what is a
[1:08:33] pillars
[1:08:36] a pillar is actually a part of the
[1:08:38] foundation for it holds up for the
[1:08:40] superstructure
[1:08:58] he's giving him the revelation of the
[1:09:00] word and of himself
[1:09:05] because that is exactly what the
[1:09:08] apostles and Prophets had
[1:09:10] Foundation
[1:10:05] now Abraham was the foundation of Faith
[1:10:09] let's say he had four foundations
[1:10:12] the foundation of Faith was Abraham and
[1:10:15] fundamentals the foundation of love was
[1:10:18] Isaac foreign
[1:11:07] you go to the Garden of the palace
[1:11:35] of the garden of the palace
[1:11:38] the devil also gets in there
[1:11:42] remember it's in the garden of the
[1:11:44] palace
[1:11:45] just like it was in a Garden of Eden
[1:11:48] just like Satan detectives
[1:11:51] just like in the Garden of Gethsemane
[1:11:54] Jesus
[1:11:56] this is where Jesus found with his
[1:11:59] greatest battle
[1:12:04] the Bible says in the Song of Solomon
[1:12:06] Cinco Uno 5-1 they say jovina
[1:12:09] means
[1:12:21] I've come into my garden my sister my
[1:12:23] spouse I have gathered my murder and my
[1:12:26] spice and I've eaten my honeycomb with
[1:12:28] my honey and I have drunk my wine with
[1:12:30] my milk ital friends drink gay drink
[1:12:32] abundantly oh beloved
[1:12:35] if you read all this chapter
[1:12:38] he speaks about this woman
[1:12:40] that is seeking this this man
[1:12:44] and she calls him my beloved
[1:12:48] so when she begins to speak about it
[1:12:53] she begins to speak of the damsels there
[1:12:56] of Jerusalem that
[1:13:20] his hands were as gold rings set with
[1:13:23] the barrel his belly is the bright ivory
[1:13:25] overlaid with sapphires he says
[1:13:29] he said his legs are as pillars of
[1:13:32] marble
[1:13:33] so in the second Feast it's
[1:13:37] found in the court Garden of the Palace
[1:13:40] of the king
[1:13:42] so that Satan can also get in the
[1:13:45] gardens
[1:14:22] because he's been there with them many
[1:14:24] times in the past
[1:14:27] the devil can find or get in the garden
[1:14:30] to get in that feast
[1:14:49] one seven
[1:14:53] so when the king had his feast
[1:15:08] and they gave them drinking bezels of
[1:15:10] gold the vessels being the verse from
[1:15:12] one to another and Royal wine and
[1:15:14] abundance according to the state of the
[1:15:15] king is
[1:15:25] the drinking was according to the law
[1:15:28] none that compelled for so the king had
[1:15:30] appointed to all the officers of the
[1:15:32] house that it should be due according to
[1:15:34] Every Man's pleasure
[1:15:35] so one thing I want you to notice
[1:15:38] that in the second piece
[1:15:41] he begins to speak about wine in Los
[1:15:44] basos De Oro and the vessels of gold
[1:15:48] we begin to speak about Moses in Romans
[1:15:52] 9
[1:15:53] spoke about Moses and pharaoh
[1:16:53] and the people that got close to him
[1:16:56] they were very sinful cambiano La Fiesta
[1:17:00] and then changing the feast under the
[1:17:02] Grace
[1:17:04] under the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:17:07] that takes away all of your sins
[1:17:10] you come to the feast
[1:17:13] now you're a vessel of gold
[1:17:16] now your God in human flesh
[1:17:20] and he fills you with the wine que
[1:17:23] esvino what is wine is La estimulation
[1:17:25] it's the stimulation of the revelation
[1:17:29] of Jesus Christ
[1:17:48] it means perfect Fellowship
[1:17:51] God in you
[1:17:55] before it was God above us
[1:18:00] when God came in human flesh
[1:18:02] it was God With Us
[1:18:13] it's the Feast of Pentecost
[1:18:18] it came out of the upper room
[1:18:20] and the people that saw them
[1:18:23] they thought that they were drunk
[1:19:09] he would do it with the whole group
[1:19:12] he would do what the whole nation of
[1:19:14] Israel
[1:19:16] it was God above them
[1:19:22] there's different sizes of vessels
[1:19:24] Iglesia
[1:19:35] which they're filled with
[1:19:48] it's a personal
[1:19:51] with you and God it's it's
[1:19:54] a vessel of gold
[1:19:57] according its own size
[1:20:00] and God will fill you with wine
[1:20:05] one time brother Ram said this is
[1:20:08] what is the new birth he says
[1:20:11] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:20:16] revealed to you
[1:20:45] the people of Israel were literally
[1:20:47] captured
[1:20:48] they were literally thirsty
[1:20:51] they were literally hungry
[1:20:54] but now in the second phase
[1:20:59] you received your freedom
[1:21:02] of the Captivity of sins spiritual you
[1:21:06] have spiritual thirst foreign
[1:21:30] it's more intimate what he wants to have
[1:21:32] with you
[1:21:33] it's a personal revelation with you
[1:22:12] he says that God is more closer to you
[1:22:14] than your right hand
[1:22:32] now we're walking upon the pavement
[1:22:41] when Moses went to the mountains
[1:22:45] he went up there with 70 elders he Jesus
[1:22:49] if you remember Jesus also
[1:22:52] he had 70 ministers with him
[1:22:56] to the missionary field
[1:23:00] and when they got back from the
[1:23:01] missionary Field
[1:23:03] Report Jesus they began to give Jesus
[1:23:06] the missionary reports
[1:23:10] and how they shared how the Devils were
[1:23:13] subject to his name
[1:23:18] and Jesus replies
[1:23:21] I see Satan
[1:23:24] falling from heaven like like lightning
[1:23:29] I've given power unto you
[1:23:33] to tread upon serpents yes
[1:23:36] us
[1:23:40] you now have the capacity
[1:23:43] to tread or walk upon him come in many
[1:23:46] places
[1:23:48] to walk over the kingdom of the devil
[1:23:52] why because you have your your
[1:23:56] vessel of wine
[1:23:58] what is the wine
[1:24:01] the wine or the rest of Revelation that
[1:24:03] you receive is
[1:24:07] and the most powerful thing there is
[1:24:09] against the the kingdom of the of the
[1:24:11] devil is the Revelation
[1:24:15] that you personally receive
[1:24:19] remember in the first Feast
[1:24:22] the people of Israel were captive
[1:24:25] they needed a revelation
[1:24:27] that God was a deliverer
[1:24:30] in the desert
[1:24:32] they were they were hungry
[1:24:35] they near the Revelation
[1:24:40] to food
[1:24:42] now it's more personal
[1:24:44] now it's not just for the whole group
[1:24:48] now it's a individual Revelation to you
[1:24:53] if someone is struggling with something
[1:24:56] sin God can reveal to you I'll still
[1:24:59] reveal himself to you
[1:25:34] God preaches the gospel
[1:25:37] in both Feasts
[1:26:25] he knows the wine that you need
[1:26:54] and reveals itself personally to you
[1:27:00] does it matter your problem
[1:27:03] in the second piece
[1:27:06] it's a more intimate Feast that he wants
[1:27:09] to have with you
[1:27:11] there's a special wine
[1:27:13] the wine of the king as the Bible says
[1:27:18] that this wine was in abundance
[1:27:22] you remember what brother Ram says
[1:27:26] the God is like that great ocean
[1:27:29] you can never find the the the bottom
[1:27:49] it's in the whole ocean
[1:28:45] the wine that he provides
[1:29:00] once in a while
[1:29:16] and wine that maketh glad the heart of
[1:29:19] man El Vino this is the wine is is
[1:29:26] one time Brothers
[1:29:29] he says what is the anointment
[1:29:32] that God uses to anoint the temple this
[1:29:36] is
[1:29:37] the joy of the Lord
[1:29:45] and if your your wine is running low
[1:29:49] the once in a while God will come
[1:29:51] and fill your wine once again like David
[1:29:55] said
[1:29:58] father restore to me the joy of my
[1:30:01] salvation
[1:30:03] you know fill me with wine once again
[1:30:06] my wine is running low
[1:30:10] I know that you're a vessel of gold it
[1:30:12] is
[1:30:13] your god in human flesh but my wine is
[1:30:17] running low
[1:30:18] Fresco I need fresh wine
[1:30:22] a fresh Revelation
[1:30:24] that you are still Jehovah Jireh
[1:30:28] your Jehovah Rapha yeah
[1:30:35] whatever personal revelation it is
[1:31:08] God already knows it
[1:31:10] is
[1:31:16] remember it's more of an intimate Feast
[1:31:21] the king knows you more intimately in
[1:31:24] this feast
[1:31:30] there was
[1:31:31] uh
[1:31:33] leads out there with the group La neces
[1:31:36] the need of the Church
[1:31:39] of the people of Israel
[1:31:41] but now on the second piece
[1:31:45] it is your own personal individual need
[1:31:49] diosante is
[1:31:51] God was dealing with them as a form of a
[1:31:54] group
[1:31:56] and now God is dealing with his people
[1:31:58] but individually
[1:32:00] the wine that I need
[1:32:03] the wine that you need
[1:32:06] it's the most more intimate Feast
[1:32:11] that he has that this person that comes
[1:32:14] to the feast
[1:32:15] it's a personal revelation it's a
[1:32:18] personal wine
