harvest [Music] he'd go out and sell in the streets in a truck i'll tell you this because he the supreme court from his own voice i know plenty of his testimony because he shared with me with a lot of emotion how he had worked before he had gotten sick he was a [Music] a warrior full of love and comprehension dominion self-control and a lot of courage the i don't know who could have withstood all of that i saw him up close for a long time [Music] i don't know brother but i'd like for the example of our brother jose ankita [Music] you don't know what's coming for us uh besides what we're already going through there are tests but with his holy spirit it's not with our strength but giving place or god to manifest himself because the word of god says in first corinthians chapter 13 the

[Music] i invite accept the lord jesus christ are you amen amen and brothers [Music] forgive me if i said things that might have hurt somebody don't [Music] god bless you brothers uh hi good morning my name is ankel emmanuel pasuelos ortiz and i am uh josue luisa's grandson we never accustom ourselves to say uh grandpa grandma we always say like granny or gramps or and saying the words the full term grandmother or grandfather it's like it made them seem really old so we gave them those cute nicknames i'd like to say some words on the 10th of january 2022. and i wrote these words the day that my grandpa passed away two days ago my mother called me applications and we talked about the applications and seeing them after my homework the doctor came in and said that we had to leave quickly because we stayed for longer than 30 minutes my grandpa didn't want anyone to go yes and that seemed very strange to granny and my mom dialysis even though going through so much pain through dialysis and medical procedures my grandfather never complained on this game before mom and grandma left he asked for one last domino game mom and grandma they laughed and then they got an agreement [Music] and then after a few minutes the call was over in person he told me that he really struggled in this last game the little pieces would fall out of his hands and his hands wouldn't stop shaking even took a few minutes just to put the domino pieces on the table my mom told me that in his last game he won he beat my mom and my grandma as they would pack their things victoria they could see him smile with his victory i could have only imagined the happiness in that moment i could only imagine how in a fraction of a second everything was normal it was all good and we had our dad once again why number seven your almighty and when i think of the month of july i think of these artificial games and celebrations but unfortunately i i feel like i made a mistake but what i'm sure of is that of the seven days of the week i want to spend them with you riendo laughing and crying just take him into the sun playing with chateau regano las plantas just watering the flowers and passing by the house [Music] or doing our favorite activity which was to eat in this corruptable world we have seven continents and with those seven continents i'm bothered because we're wasting time here so much of terrain to cover and explore i promise that i would take you to any place at any moment nothing will be apart from cancer and it still isn't for you for me but for us forgive me for not being able to take you to new places to eat in new places pleasing places exotic places and expensive places where i wish you could ask for more than seven plates i wished i could have appreciated everything that god has given us sight beauty that you can only see with the more time that you look at it the beauty that's captured by perception and is nourished by love like the love that you gave to me he believed in me he believed in me when all the problems were against me he believed in me when my back was against the wall el padre perfecto the perfect father hermano when i was a little boy he'd make me and my brother smile laugh no spurs you chase us with the vacuum and make us cry and then laugh and then cry again i wish that he could have kept working i wish you could have seen me work from seven in the morning until the next day maybe at 7pm we could make ourselves something to eat you deserve to rest because you're a spectacular in life the last thing i told you is all my achievements they're dedicated to you and i love you administrator everything is possible and i'll administer my time better i promise you god created the world in six days and on the seventh day he rested seven is destined to represent perfection and the fullness then through seven minutes your heart stays still and his heart stood still for seven minutes and i was there to translate what the seven medics were saying i wasn't there to count to seven or for my mother to be there to reach his seventh breath problem and i wish i could have picked my phone and grabbed the seven pieces of dominoes to play if i would have won maybe you would have been here maybe the impulse of wanting that rematch would have kept you awake to be here maybe we could play for seven hours more or for seven more games maybe i could have hit in your room for seven hours and everything would have been okay and they're in a domino game please give me my rematch and i say and i know that you never say no to that and in that matter you could teach me all your tricks and give to me all your wisdom and knowledge i never saw you angry or explode out of frustration you're always so loving and so kind always cracking jokes and smiling like a little kid and you're happy and you choose to be happy and you choose to keep calm in desperate situations and you choose to battle hate with love and he'd stand as like a wall in front of the bicycle even though i was going as fast as i could and he'd stop me like that as a child in my heart i also just want to say he's the best father i could have ever known and the number seven seven are angelical numbers my heart is so calm knowing that he's there amongst them and then leaving the hospital on the 10th of january is and every day i'm thankful with god connell with him me my mom my mother and my mom because of them we are the people that we are and i never forget how proud he was of me and my brother he never failed in reminding us that he had every time we see him he'd always remind us keep going on in school keep going on with what you're doing and i get happy knowing that he's watching over us and i know that he's still watching i want him to keep watching because we've gotten plenty to make him proud still and i know i might be selfish in thinking and being sad that he's not here is and i'm being sad i'm sad and i'm selfish to know that he's not going to be here to see me and my brother graduate the csb engineers and lawyers as well [Music] to be at my side at the altar for my wedding won't be there when i buy my first house and i know i'm being selfish because the memories continue and i know that he's smiling in peace and finally after so much pain i know that he's resting i thank god because i feel in my heart that he's smiling [Music] i know that he's very happy i want to tell him he doesn't have anything to worry about after so many injections so much pain so much medical procedures it's his time thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] you know that we're here with our brother and his body here present we've always been together in the good times and the bad times [Music] we fellowship for a long time even in the same house [Music] i don't remember how many years but more than 15 years but knowing that our brother's in a better place [Music] [Music] [Music] we fight not against flesh and blood but spirits that are in the air and my brother he battled plenty against him he battled when the battle was good [Music] it's because that's what his word says we know that those in christ they don't die they just sleep and he's up there with him right now el esta because the bible says there's many promises for all those that die in christ i'd like to read something that says what death is for the christians for second corinthians chapter five verse eight says this you see it says we are confident i say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the lord and it also says in the book of philippians 1 23. the moment that a christian dies his presence goes immediately unto christ and the apostle paul he spoke about his desire to die and go before christ there's many scriptures like mark 5 39 [Music] we went to go wake up a girl that they said was dead but she was not dead when you come in he sayeth unto them ties your eyes why make us this addo and weep damsel is not dead but sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn marcel but when he put them all out of the father and the mother of the damsel [Music] and straight away the dams of the rose and walked out for she was 12 years of age and she was astonished with a great astonishment here's an example of that the christian doesn't die but he's just sleeping that he's given to us he was a man of much faith so he [Music] saliva will get his life will get better and better [Music] sometimes we go every 15 days we like to go more frequently like two to three times but for that same reason i would tell my wife we need to be careful and also care for the brother lately we were traveling a lot to mexico we also had to be aware and take care of ourselves in order to take care of others i'd where him one morning and the brother he had the holy ghost he was loved by god and that form that dove is uh what i could say the signs that he sent him that he was the son of god drop its head to look at the brother's face it was something very beautiful that we saw and the brother he was something special and i thank god because he put him in our path he didn't put me in his path your person may come in god placed him in my heart could see when you go out into dialysis and my poor brother would just move his head it was a difficult trial that my brother had i'm already accustomed did [Music] mr maria thank you for loving my brother my name mr daisy gracias thank you for taking care of him so much it's a great love that you have for him [Music] [Music] [Music] the best hands are than being in the hands of our lord jesus christ that's the greatest thing get close to the lord jesus christ the same way and we want to see him again we've got to be walking with our lord jesus christ like the prophet said to be on the side of jesus jesus because if you're not on jesus's side then you're on the other side so there's two paths the way the path of the lord jesus christ the path of satan [Music] no one wants to perish without being in the presence of the lord jesus christ we've got to be conscious when we depart like our brother said a while ago to be sure on what side we're on we were in the worst [Music] now in the lord jesus christ left without words what our young man said in our brother no it's not easy brothers passing to go through something bitter like that's not easy to drink like bitter vinegar lord jesus christ when he was at the cross he desired some water but they gave him vinegar water he just turned his mouth to the side tomorrow can't drink that what is [Music] we've got to do something so when he's over there lost that's the only way i'm ready for you my brethren to also be ready because if we were ready he places the example of a life following the way he did i'll be closing with this brothers family right in [Music] like angel said that's what broke my heart the most is just like us on earth we've got to give to our heavenly father [Music] i bless you i love this [Music] goodbyes [Music] will there be spoken entire [Music] anymore [Music] someday [Music] they're my hopes shall be [Music] i'm looking out across the river [Music] there's just [Music] then i will [Music] my shall be [Music] you may be seated just for a few moments we're going to try and just shorten the time and we're going to open our bibles to the book of luke 10 27. the word of god says answering he said thou shalt love the lord god with all thy heart and all thy soul is and with all thy strength and with all thy mind and thy neighbor as thyself and said unto him that was answered right who is my neighbor entonces the word says he tried to justify himself and god gave him a parable there was a man quebec that was walking on his way and he was assaulted he was wounded almost to the point of killing him then give him what he needs and when i return i'll pay you entonces he said the lord says of these three who was the one who was the one that loved this man that was wounded answered is the man that had mercy upon him he said do that and you shall live and says god desires that we love him with all of our hearts with all of our soul and all of our strengths but many times we justify ourselves we think about it and he knows it he knows what we're going to do so the purpose is that we love him with all of our heart because he doesn't he embraced this message we believe by faith that he was an overcomer and applying the word of god to his life he overcame his finales he reached his last days benciendo to say goodbye to the remains of our brother [Music] and those that remain still here else the lord continues to remind there's still time in the book of isaiah chapter one verse eight this come now and let us reason together saith the lord through your sins be as god though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool if you be willing and obedient you shall eat the good of the land consumed but if you refuse and rebel you shall be devoured with the sword for the mouth of the lord hath spoken so we know that everything has a price problem and that's the problem that many times we don't want to pay the price but god is righteous that's why it says in romans 8 28. and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of the son of god that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified and says so these are the promises of god and he's waiting that every one of us while we understands life we've got the opportunity to get close to him apocalypses in the book of revelation it's got seven blessings for all those that love it those that believe in it those that are growing spiritually in that measure esta an applicant they're applying that word to their lives there's seven blessings the first says let him heal with the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i have to eat of the hidden mana el cual esta el medio which del paraiso the midst of god's paradise that's one second the second says heather hathan here here's what the spirits say it unto the churches shall not hurt of the second death it's beautiful those are problems let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches of the hidden man and i will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written el cual ninguno conoce which no man knoweth saving he that received and every time that the lord speaks to us through his word that we could pay attention and we could straighten up our lives with this word the last blessing that it speaks of in revelation so he that overcometh obtain all things i will be his god and he shall be my son amen amen because of time this [Music] and that he give you all the strengths necessary to go through this difficulties as a church here at jericho estamos con ustedes we're with you all to place our shoulders he's left a great legacy for his family a great example but now it's on them to follow that example we ask that you help every member of the family you bless them and reveal your words every one of them will you be with them in everything father que tu suplas qualiquer the name of our lord jesus christ amen thank you brother she may be seated [Music] when the trumpet of the lord shall sound and time shall be normal and the morning
