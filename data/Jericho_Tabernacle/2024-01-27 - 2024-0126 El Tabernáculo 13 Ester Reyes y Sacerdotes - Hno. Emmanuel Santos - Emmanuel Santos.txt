help them according to their need for we place ourselves into your hands asking that you take control of every single thing help us and also bless us for we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen just as we're standing we're going to read our scriptures to Exodus 19 uh Chapter 19 Verse 5 now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant then you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the Earth is mine and ye shall be unto a kingdom of priests and and holy nation these are the words which Thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel and may the Lord add his Blessing to his reading of his word you may be seated we also want to thank the musicians now on this chapter 19 let's say well we've come to a very crucial point that the people of Israel find themselves in it's a chapter now if you study it throughout the message it's when the people of Israel changed the grace that they had into great uh law and brother random says in the message the uh Paradox now if we notice then their Journey uh then their journey in the wilderness is where they got their greatest mistake uh that Israel ever made until Calvary was when in Exodus 19 they accepted law instead of Grace they had Grace they had a prophet they had they had a sacrifice uh sacrificial lamb they had Redemption they had been uh brought through the Red Sea they had been healed of their diseases and they had had water from a smitten Rock they had they had Mana Out of Heaven everything they had need of had been supplied and still they wanted something else now that's a perfect type of our Ephesians today exactly we come out of under Luther we went through sanctification under methodists and came into the restoration under Pentecost exactly like it was the Wilderness journey and when God brought us out we did very well but what did we do we wanted to be like the rest of them now we find out that Grace is the only thing that takes us through never law and now being that all of us know by now that the people could not enter into that Promised Land uh through law and only you can only enter in through Grace now our promised land is the Holy Ghost now here in Exodus 19 in the scripture that we had read here the God is telling them God wants them to be a a priesthood a kingdom of a priesthood so then there's two things United in one that they would be Kings and Priests but because they wanted the law instead of the grace God stood in both things and if you see throughout the Bible one tribe was the tribe of uh the priests and the other tribe was the tribe of Kings but God's original desire was that he wanted both of those offices to be in one people for all of them to be United and not separated but since they had chosen law and not Grace they could never accomplish something like that but since we are under grace in First Peter uh 2:9 but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood under grace you can be both Royal and priesthood if you stay under the law you will never accomplish to be a royal priesthood and just like Jesus Christ is the king of kings and is also the high priest he is one single person but he has multiple offices he has both offices now we're going to take the subject of Esther in Esther 25 now in the place there was a certain Jew whose name was uh Mori uh the son of Jer uh the son of shimi and the son of Kish a benjamite who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the Captivity which had been carried away with uh Janiah the king of Judah and whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away and he brought up hadasa that is Esther his uncle's daughter for she had neither father nor mother and the maid was fair and beautiful whom morai when her father and mother were dead took for his own daughter now one thing that brother Brandon teaches us is that person should always find Jesus Christ in every verse of the Bible so he also teaches us that the scriptures have a double meaning or multiple meanings now here when he talks about Esther from what we can read we tells us that she was an orphan she didn't have a father or a mother and we're talking about that uh subject of Kings and Priests and when we search out through the Bible we find out that there is a king and a priest that is one single person who did not have also a father or a mother and his name was MDC in Hebrews 7 Hebrews 713 for this mzc the king of Salem priest of the most high God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation of king of righteousness and after that also the king of Salem which is king of peace without father without mother just like Esther was Esther in the natural she was an orphan because she did not have a father or a mother but now if you apply it into the spiritual you can see that she is something like MDC because later on in her life she became being a queen and a priest to intercede for her people so that scripture is not only talking about an orphan child it also speaks about how she is something like MDC a priest and a king both offices in a single person nothing separated but both things united into one in one single person now we're going to be reading a lot of scriptures tonight and it reads here in Revelations 15 now it speaks about Jesus Christ and from Jesus Christ who is a faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father now I want you to pay close attention that he made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father now we're going to read something that brother brandham says and the message Hebrews chapter 7 number two and he said and this mzc was not Jesus for he was God and what made Jesus and God different was that Jesus was the tabernacle that God dwelt in see now MDC Jesus had both father and mother and this man never had father or mother Jesus had a beginning of Life and he had an end of life and this man had no father nor mother no beginning of days or ending of life but it was the uh was the self same person so now here brother Bram is telling us that both of these uh people or it appears to be two people MDC and Jesus he says that they're different but then he says that they're the same person and he continues to say like this uh mzc and Jesus was one but Jesus was the Earthly body born and fashioned after sin God's own body his own son born and fashioned after sin to take the thing out of the death to pay the ransom and to receive Sons and Daughters unto himself now the reason being that they're two different people and although they're the same person is because one per one of them is made of three different things a human being is both Body Spirit and soul so then the body of Jesus was not God but what was inside of Jesus it was God that's the reason why it was two different people but even then they're the same person and brother Bram says in Hebrews chapter 7 part part one now we want to notice here now again as we go on with this lesson of uh this MDC this great priest of Salem and the uh and the possessor of Heaven and the earth now being first without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor ending of life but was made like unto the Son of God abideth a priest continually now watch he wasn't the Son of God he was the god of the son he wasn't the Son of God mzc wasn't but he was the father of the Son of God but Jesus Christ himself says my father and I are one so what seems to be two different people there are just two different attributes that are within a single person and it reads in John 5 and verse 18 therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him because he not only broke the Sabbath but said also that God was his father uh What uh horrible saying was to say that God was his father but then the scriptures continue to say that God was his own father being co equal to God so by Jesus saying that God was his father he was basically saying that he was God himself and that's the very same thing that happens to you when you say or confess that you're a Christian when you are born again you are now a child of God you then confess that you have the Holy Spirit and God is your father and now God dwells in you just the same as uh God dwell in Jesus that's the reason why you and God are one because God lives in you it's two different people in one single person and the scripture says in John 17 21 that they all may be one as thou father are in me and I in thee and that they also may be one in us and in verse 22 and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may go ahead that they may be one even as we are one i in them and thou and me that they may be made perfect in one so then you come have to come to the realization that that when you become a child of God you then now become a God just the same as brother Luis told us on Sunday God was the god of the universe but Adam was the god of the earth and he says that when Jesus Christ returns we shall reign the Earth with him but you first have to learn Reign over your body because your body was made out of the earth you are a Dei God or a small God because you are a child of God because you are now one with God that is something that the devil has always desired to be like God and and it says here in uh Isaiah yeah and Isaiah 14 verse 12 how art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did is weaken the Nations for thou Hast said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit upon the mountain of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high that was the devil's desire to be like God but he was never able to accomplish it but the Bible says that when God created Adam he made it like unto His Image so then what you be end up becoming in your spiritual life you end up becoming like God something that the devil exactly wanted to be but he was was never able to accomplish it and brother Bram says in the message questions and answers on Hebrews number three God told Abraham look up to the heavens and Number the Stars if you can and he said I can't do it he said neither will you be able to number remember the your seed the stars who is the bright and Morning Star Jesus of Nazareth the brightest that ever lived in human flesh he is the bright and Morning Star and he is the Seed of Abraham coming through Isaac and we being dead in Christ take on Abraham's seat and our erors according to the promise so the stars of the heaven represented the spirits of man here and then if you remember when the devil began his lies it was with the stars of the heaven but now the stars of the heaven are spirits that are now here on Earth and brother bam has always told us what the devil tried to do up there in heaven when he was cast out of heaven and he came down into Earth he continues to try to do the same thing the devil up there in heaven he tried to create his own kingdom and when he was cast down on Earth he tried to create his own kingdom as well but he does it through through the realm of the spirits I in previous years when I had begun this journey at the age of around 18 I began to interpret it was something a bit strange for me I would study every single word that I would hear you may think you know English and you might think that you know Spanish but when it's time for you to interpret you find out that you don't know nothing and one of my greatest fears if I could say it this way is I grew a fear that I didn't know how to uh correctly interpret a word so then I would go home and study every single word that I would hear I would hear the tapes of brother brandham even though that I didn't understand a single thing that he said I would pay more attention to the words that he would use when I would read the Bible I would read every single word and I would try to understand understand it even though I didn't understand what the reason why it was written in that manner so one of the tapes that I started hearing about about brother brandham years ago was de demonology and you know that brother Bram divides that into two sections now in English he uses a very specific word realm which is the word realm but when the interpreters translated it into Spanish they used another word that was very similar which is kingdom and within myself I had a a conflict remember I said you think you know your own language but when it comes time for you to interpret youve come to realize that you don't know nothing and me and my young mind I thought that I knew what that word meant and I said to myself well the interpreters really messed up here and in reality they never did the one that was wrong was me uh because of that word realm the translation to that is uh sphere but but in studying that single word I found out that that word means two things a kingdom and a dimension so then when brother Bron was talking about demonology and he talks about how the devil also wanted to create his own kingdom he does it throughout the sphere of the dimensions that's how he's able to create his own kingdom the devil can make his own kingdom through a dimension that's why the Curiosity really grew in being to learn what the word realm meant now we might not be able to see spirits but we can see the effect or the actual impact of what they cause and we always know that the world is controlled by either one or the other the spirit of God or the the spirit of the devil but both equally are trying to edify their Kingdom but it's throughout the dimensions because the spirit of God is also an invisible spirit that works throughout the dimensions but we also are trying to edify the kingdom of God but it's throughout Spirits now remember brother brandham said that the stars of the heaven represent the spirits of the mankind here on Earth that's the reason why he says in job 384 where was thou when I laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou Hast understanding when the morning Stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy and notice what brother bam says here in the message the beginning and ending of the Gentile dispensation and the great high priest mzc will come someday and will EAD communion a new with him in the kingdom of God one of those great Glorious Days oh I'm so happy tonight to be in his kingdom yes sir some great day some marvelous day time shall be no more see we come out of Eternity we was before there was a world did you know that God ma God made man in his own image where was you he said to Job when job thought that he had some wisdom said where was you when I laid the foundation of the world before I laid it when the sons of God sang together and the morning Stars shouted for Joy the morning Stars shouted for Joy now he's talking about stars here but the stars represent spirits of men here on Earth them shining ones out shouted for Joy when they seen that someday they were uh tabernacled here on Earth and the king mzc would come in the righteousness of God and give his life to redeem us to God again back again and outshine the Stars forever and ever now what had begun over there in heaven is now being portrayed here on Earth through both sides they're both trying to edify their own kingdom through the Spheres through the dimensions and Their Kingdoms brother brandham says United under one head see the same devil if he can get you to stop just for a minute and he can make you reason it out he can make you think in your mind but God doesn't use a man's head God uses his heart God works on his heart oh um sorry when you get to be one with God God comes to your heart he doesn't come to your mind he comes to your heart that's why he says that God uses his heart God works in his heart while the devil Works in his head because both sides they're both trying to edify their own kingdom through the spirits that move throughout the Spheres says here God chose the heart because the scripture says for though uh for God said his heart as a man thinketh in his heart so is he now brother BR says that God uses the heart but the devil uses the mind and in 2 Corinthians uh 103 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to pull uh to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ so our war today as it says it's not something carnal it's not something natural but it's a something that happens within your own mind and what the Bible tells us that we must do is that you must take that thought and bring it into The Obedience of Christ and Christ is his own word that's why in previous years when we spoke about uh the complexes we spoke about how it's something that happens first in your mind it's a spirit that comes into your mind and if you allow that Spirit to maintain it itself in there you're going to begin to edify a kingdom where you are the king and you will do whatever you want and you will live according to that complex when in reality what you should be living your life as is through the holy spirit that lives in you but the spirits they want to build a complex within your mind but God wants to use your spirit that's within your heart so that you may edify a kingdom not of complexes not of unbelief not of Doubt but you as a child of God be one of one with God being just like God you are also a creator just as God created worlds into existence you through faith can create your own world and live in your own world of faith brother bam says in the message the exposition of the seven Church ages the revelation of Jesus Christ he hath made us oh there are certain truths that we need to emphasize this is one of them he he have made us salvation is his doing salvation is of the Lord all of Grace he redeemed us for a purpose he bought us for a purpose we are Kings spiritual Kings oh we are going to be Kings upon the earth when him with him when he sits on his throne but now we are spiritual Kings and we Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom and there we see the word sphere once again where it's a dimension but a kingdom that's within a uh Dimension it's a spiritual Kingdom and brother Bram continues to say right now we reign with Christ having dominion over sin the World the Flesh and the devil showing forth his praise and glory showing forth himself for it is Christ in US willing and doing of his good pleasure yes indeed even now we are seated we are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus okay Bo now I'm going to go to Esther 2:15 remember I put all of this as a foundation to speak now about Esther now remember it's not only Esther it's you Esther by birth did not have a father or a mother but spiritually she was something like mzc which was a king and priest without beginning of days and Without End of Days brother Bram says that that represents eternal life because eternity is without beginning or end now if you've read the book of Esther in the first chapter the king Had A Feast for seven days and in the last day of the feast he called his Queen to come before him and she didn't want to she denied him and that's for that very reason that the king took her away from her position so in and then in the next couple of chapters Begins the search for a new king uh Queen it's just the same as God is looking for a uh a queen or bride now if you read in chapter two Esther had to go through three steps before she could become a queen and just the same as each and every one of us before we can be a child of God and becoming a child of God we begin to be a spiritual priest spiritual King we also pass through three steps which is justification sanctification and then the baptism of the Holy Ghost and now when Esther came up to the very last step the third one in Esther 2:15 now when the turn of Esther the daughter of uh Abel the uncle of morai who had taken her for his daughter was come to go into the king she required nothing but Hagi the king's Chamberlain The Keeper of the women appointed and Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her so Esther was taken unto the king uh whoas into his his house Royal in the 10th month which is the month of tith in the seventh year of his Reign and the King loved Esther above all the women and she obtained grace and favor in the sight of more than all the virgins V so that he set the Royal Crown upon her head and made her Queen instead of uh vashi so I want you to notice that in that third step was the crowning and now brother bam says in the message of Phil uh Philadelphian uh Church age what is a crown what is a crown it's a it's a crown which means that you have a Dominion you are a king if you are crowned see and we are the sons of God when we're crowned with eternal life you when you receive eternal life you then become a king spiritually speaking and it says that our Dominion is the Earth make you priests and Kings unto God okay just like we spoke last time we spoke about how there was a man in that Kingdom and his name was uh Aman and he represented the devil because he wanted the worship of the king just the same as the devil wanted to be worshiped uh like God now this man uh amen he hated the Jews so much that he began to bring up a plan so that all the Jews in the king of this man king were to be killed but he didn't know that his very own Queen was a Jew so then Esther when she found out about this news she had to make a decision she had not uh told the king her true identity she never told them that she was a Jew so then what the Bible tells us now remember we're talking about Kings and Priests the Bible says that she prayed and fasted for three days and that's something that I've noticed that once you begin to consecrate yourself a little more the more you can get closer to God the more you dedicate time to God it's more assured that God will respond to you and Esther had uh three days separated that she prayed and fasted and at the end of those days the Bible says that she clothed herself now remember at this point in time she is now a queen she had the crown in other words she already had eternal life so then what she did she had to go with the King to present her petition and notice here the Bible tells us that by Grace we are saved there's nothing that we can do or that we've done to Merit eternal life but the Bible also tells us in that very same chapter that God has Works prepared for us that we have to fulfill even though there is no works that we can do to be saved then now when we're all already saved there is now things that he wants us to do for him just the same as the Bible teaches us about Esther that she found Grace upon the uh before the king and she was crowned in other words she already had eternal life then when she had already eternal life she then had a work to do as a a priest to intercede for her people so that they may be saved we will never deserve uh Salvation but we receive God's salvation and eternal life but then there comes a point in your life that you must do something for God in favor of someone else and do you remember the story about sister Hatty right and it's something that I was listening to today remember what the devil wanted to do was to be like God to be worship like God and brother Bram says that the only difference between the devil and God is that the devil cannot create but we as children of God we are creators we can create our own world of faith and live in that world of Faith through the spirit that's within our heart we begin to edify a kingdom and then we can live in that Kingdom with Jesus Christ but the devil will always want to pervert that which you have created if you have created a world of Faith the devil will always try to pervert that faith and try to create it into unbelief right now sister had right I think for the most part all of us know the story but it really caught my attention the way that brother bandam started to narate it he said that she had a sister she had a sister that was bed written for many years brother bam says that they would always pray for her and she could never come to a full healing and he also tells us that uh sister had Wright was a very poor woman and she was a widow she used to work a lot to be able to uh feed her children and even then at that time they were in in Works in to remodel the the the church and he says that she donated $50 and in that time $50 was a lot so from the uh depths of the hearts of the brothers they wanted to return that money to Sister Hattie because she was struggling to be able to feed her children and to be able to live but then God reminded brother brandham of that uh poor old lady in the Bible that she gave all of her money even though it was very little but she gave everything that she had and she compared or he compared it to sister had right and brother brandham had uh the the thought of returning at least a portion of that money but God did not permit him because he had something greater for her Remember by Grace you are saved you can never do anything to inherit eternal life but then when then now when you are saved God is expecting you to do certain things for his kingdom and the Bible tells us and if I had time I would take the scriptures to show you I have them written down here but I don't have enough time the Bible tells us that when you approach night to God and you approach his throne the Bible tells us that you're supposed to approach it with faith you're supposed to approach him knowing that he is God is the key isth faith and mzc is the king of righteousness and the Bible tells us that we are uh righteous righteous through faith now the same thing as Esther by Grace she was elected to be Queen she was given a crown that represents eternal life so then she was now in the Kingdom of that King she was then now like a priest and King her having eternal life she then now had to do something for her people and just the same way that sister had Wright a Christian saved by grace she did something in favor for her [Music] children and it's such a powerful thing that brother brandham says that when brother bam starts speaking about the squirrels sister had wght she spoke the right thing because when you approach God you must approach him with faith and she said that is nothing but the truth brother brandham and so then when Esther approached the Throne of the god with faith she found Grace with that King and that King told her ask whatever you will I'll give you whatever you will even up to the half of my kingdom and when brother Brandon speaks about sister had rght he says that God was so pleased with what she had said he told Brother brandom tell her that she has found found grace before God so that she may ask whatever she will and I will grant it to her so then Esther approaching unto the king that is something that you must do Also spiritually when you approach God you approach unto him with faith and as you're coming unto him with faith he then responds you as a a child of God you are then a small God you are now two omnipotents that are approaching one with the other and brother Bram says that when two omnipotent people approach then all things are possible in that moment so then when Esther was approaching to the king her being a woman of eternal life the king then sees her and sees himself because he is then Eternal he is the savior and when God sees you approaching unto him he sees himself he sees the work of Salvation that he's done in him and he sees that he will have eternal life you are just a reflection of God because you and God are one even though there's two you are both one that's the reason why the Bible speaks of eser in that manner the Bible says that she approached unto him and now there is a law that exists whosoever enters into that place without being called they shall be killed now we're talking about the law and the grace uh under law in the Old Testament whoever uh whichever person that entered into the tabernacle into the throne would fall dead what was it that helped Esther to not come out dead it was the love that the king had towards Esther the love that he expressed towards her through an instrument that was called uh Selter the scepter sorry and in Hebrews 81 oh 18 sorry but unto the son he saith thy Throne oh God is forever and ever and the scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom represent and that scepter represented the kingdom of God that scepter represented the righteousness of God one of the things that I see that the Bible speaks about righteousness is that it's justification when brother Bram teaches us about uh uh justification he tells us that when a person is Justified he is first forgiven of all of the past sins and then he also adds on that it's like that person never committed a sin to begin with and so then when a person would approach the Tabernacle they would approach the throne they would be killed because they were born in a sinful manner but then when you are now born again you are then Justified and it's like you've never sinned in the first place but nonetheless now you are clean you now can enter into the throne and so then when Esther approached into the throne that's the moment when you were Justified of your sins since you are now clean of your sins you then now have permission to go or the right to go into that throne and that's the reason why we're Kings and Priests because we reign with Christ but in a dimension but we are also priests who can intercede for other people just as Esther did it for her people and her sister Hatty Wright did it for her children if you wouldn't mind standing with me as I read the final thing in Hebrews 4:14 seeing then that we have a high a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast for our profession for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the field of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin Let Us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in time of need let us bow our heads Heavenly Father we want to thank you for this little lesson of your word and to be able to see how different we are from you but in the same manner we are one with you and confessing that we are children of God and that God is our father that then means that that person and God are one help each and every person for each and every one of them are priests that in one point in their life they will approach a person that will need their help they will need them to guide them un salvation even though though that we are not the Savior we can help them Lord to be able to lead them under the Salvation just as Esther did with her people and sister had did with her children we ask that you help each and every person Lord that they may be able to meditate on these words so that they may understand what they must do in the kingdom of God being a a king and a priest we ask all of this Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen may the Lord bless [Applause] [Music] you praise God [Music] I
