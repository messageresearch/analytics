[35:09] the Lord bless you
[35:14] Brothers God bless you tonight it is a
[35:25] pleasure I believe is also a very great
[35:27] way to be able to bring God's word to
[35:29] his
[35:31] people uh because they deserve the best
[35:36] amen expecting to receive something from
[35:38] the
[35:41] Lord just as we're standing not to keep
[35:43] you standing for so
[35:47] long I would like to read in Isaiah
[35:52] [Music]
[35:53] 4522 once you find it you can say Amen
[35:59] Isaiah
[36:11] 45:22 if you have
[36:15] it the word of the Lord
[36:23] says lto me and be ye saved all the ends
[36:27] of the Earth for I am God and there is
[36:29] none
[36:31] else let's bow our
[36:34] heads our loving Heavenly
[36:38] Father Lord we thank you
[36:43] tonight for this brand new opportunity
[36:46] that you have given us to come to your
[36:50] house we're asking that you be the one
[36:53] that comes down on the scene
[36:58] and don't just allow it to be a simple
[37:00] young man that is speaking to the
[37:02] people but Let It Be You
[37:06] Lord we put this service in your
[37:12] hands hoping that you can be pleased
[37:14] with
[37:16] us and speak to us as
[37:19] well we ask for all these
[37:22] things in the name of the Lord Jesus
[37:25] Christ amen
[37:28] you may be seated
[37:30] Brothers we thank the
[37:39] musicians uh tonight I would like to
[37:41] speak on a
[37:45] subject uh the title I would like to
[37:48] call it uh let us look and follow
[37:52] Jesus and the decision uh for this
[37:55] subject
[37:56] [Music]
[37:58] is a specifically thinking on the time
[38:00] that we're currently living
[38:05] in uh I believe there's nothing better
[38:07] that we can
[38:10] do than to look onto and follow the lord
[38:13] Jesus
[38:15] Christ because just as he said here in
[38:18] his word in Isaiah
[38:22] 45 look unto me and be saved all the
[38:25] ends of the Earth
[38:28] for I am God and there is none
[38:32] else because he's the only on that can
[38:34] give us our
[38:38] Salvation the only one that we can look
[38:40] onto and
[38:42] follow which is a a secure
[38:46] place where you can have your
[38:50] salvation because he says for I am God
[38:53] and there is none
[38:56] else if we look on the outside to other
[39:02] religions they have what they call uh
[39:04] several
[39:07] Saints to whom they pray a lot
[39:13] too they have St Jude and so
[39:18] on which is the saint for
[39:21] protection for your
[39:25] wellbeing uh but they forget
[39:29] that there's only
[39:33] one that all of them rest that they call
[39:36] supposedly
[39:38] Saints they can't answer back to
[39:41] them because there's only
[39:43] one which
[39:48] lives and he holds all the answers that
[39:50] you will ever
[39:53] need which is able to answer you for any
[39:57] specific
[40:00] thing and I would like to read in the
[40:03] message uh look unto
[40:07] Jesus in the second page paragraph
[40:10] number
[40:11] 10 he says and I ask
[40:15] myself in the time now that we're now
[40:17] living
[40:21] in it says what could we look to that
[40:24] would be more solid than God
[40:27] and God is his
[40:31] word so look to the word of God today
[40:33] for your
[40:36] answer the Bible has the answer for this
[40:41] day it's had it for other
[40:44] days it's got it
[40:49] forever because it is Christ the same
[40:51] yesterday today and
[40:54] forever and brother Bram he asked the
[40:56] question
[40:59] is there
[41:03] something or something that we can look
[41:05] onto that is more solid than
[41:09] God Something That We're secure
[41:13] in that has the real
[41:18] promise that can answer any question
[41:21] that you may
[41:24] have because he's the only one that
[41:26] holds the answer
[41:29] and he has left it here in his
[41:33] word and maybe it would just seem like
[41:35] it's an ancient
[41:40] book and you might say well that was
[41:42] just in the times of of past when he
[41:44] would just answer those
[41:46] things but it wasn't only for past
[41:54] times but there's also an answer
[41:57] currently today for the things that
[41:58] you're going to and you can find it in
[42:00] the
[42:04] Bible because reading here in the Bible
[42:07] I I was remembering that in the last
[42:08] pages in the
[42:11] back when the end comes to the entire
[42:14] Book of
[42:16] Revelation there's a there's a guy a
[42:18] guiding Angel
[42:20] there and he was looking unto that
[42:24] guide that there were some rows and in a
[42:28] line that
[42:30] said that for
[42:33] salvation uh home or family
[42:36] problems things like
[42:38] that and he would give them scriptures
[42:40] for
[42:43] that and those are still answers
[42:45] currently for
[42:52] today so then uh brother vam says and I
[42:54] wonder in a time that we are living in
[42:56] now what could we look to would be more
[42:58] solid than
[43:01] God because we could follow uh thousands
[43:04] of gods that are on the
[43:07] outside but none is more solid than God
[43:11] himself and
[43:13] why because they're
[43:16] lifeless not a single one of them will
[43:18] be able to answer back to
[43:20] you God is the only
[43:22] one that's why he
[43:25] said say for I am God and there is none
[43:32] else if we can place it in in a human
[43:36] life outside of the spiritual
[43:41] realm there's sometimes there's people
[43:43] that follow other
[43:45] people they look up to these
[43:48] people and they want to be like
[43:52] them they want their life to mirror the
[43:54] the person that they're following
[43:58] but if you start
[44:01] thinking man can't just simply follow a
[44:07] man a man just can't simply set his eyes
[44:09] on another
[44:11] man because man can
[44:14] fail but God will never fail
[44:18] you now if you begin to
[44:23] think all these people that follow other
[44:25] people they say oh I want my life to be
[44:27] just like that person's
[44:29] life I want to be just like
[44:32] them because they have a lot of
[44:35] money uh they're known by a lot of
[44:39] people but there comes a moment that
[44:42] that person that they're
[44:46] following their eyes are so set on that
[44:50] person in their
[44:52] life they're mimicking every step that
[44:55] that other person is making
[44:59] in that moment that that other person uh
[45:02] commits a failure or makes a
[45:05] mistake now they're just left thinking
[45:08] what do I do
[45:09] now that person they failed here they
[45:12] lost
[45:13] everything now no one knows
[45:17] them and and at that moment they have
[45:20] two
[45:22] choices they just remain lost without
[45:25] knowing what to do
[45:29] or they just keep following him and
[45:31] continue in the same steps that they
[45:32] were
[45:33] in that's why it
[45:37] says there is no one that is more solid
[45:40] or firm than
[45:43] God because when your eyes are set on
[45:45] Jesus
[45:50] Christ when you in your spiritual life
[45:52] your spiritual eyesight is placed on
[45:53] Jesus Christ
[45:57] you say I want to have the life of Jesus
[46:01] Christ I want my life to be just like
[46:03] the life of Jesus Christ then you can
[46:06] rest
[46:07] assured that there won't be any failures
[46:09] then in your
[46:11] life and if you start taking the
[46:16] steps and you set your eyes on Jesus
[46:20] Christ what you will find is salvation
[46:29] and why did I touch this subject on how
[46:31] people look up to other people and they
[46:33] follow these other
[46:36] people uh remembering when I was in
[46:38] school in high
[46:41] school I I remember I was taking an
[46:43] English
[46:46] class and the teacher she gave us this
[46:49] uh project that we had to
[46:52] do I really don't recall the story that
[46:55] it was
[47:01] [Music]
[47:03] but more or less I think it was about a
[47:04] girl that was from palast or Pakistan or
[47:07] more or less around
[47:11] there that in her country where she was
[47:14] at they wouldn't allow girls to go to
[47:18] school so this girl began to break the
[47:24] rules trying to get the girls to go back
[47:26] to school
[47:32] she was even going to go to court to be
[47:34] able to fight this case so that the the
[47:36] girls can go back to
[47:39] school so at the end of the
[47:43] project the teacher asked us to do a
[47:46] certain
[47:54] job and during that time there was a lot
[47:56] of people that would love look up to
[47:57] this specific girl and they would say
[47:58] wow it's an awesome thing that this girl
[48:00] has
[48:01] accomplished I want to do
[48:10] that so then she gave us the task of
[48:13] finding our own role model that we would
[48:15] like to
[48:16] follow who we would look up
[48:22] to and why is it that person was so
[48:24] inspiring for us to follow them
[48:29] I believe that's the only homework at
[48:30] school that I really didn't
[48:34] do because I never really regarded
[48:37] someone else as someone that I look up
[48:43] to at church I can uh admire the work of
[48:47] a Preacher of a song
[48:48] leader but outside in the
[48:52] world I really don't regard anyone else
[48:55] as someone to look up to
[48:59] because like I said a man can't follow
[49:01] another
[49:03] man just like it says that a it's the
[49:06] blind leading the
[49:08] blind both will end up being
[49:11] lost falling into a
[49:17] hole it's the same thing that happens
[49:19] that when when someone is following the
[49:20] life of someone else that is in the
[49:23] world it's just simply a blind person
[49:25] leading another blind person
[49:29] and both will fall into the same
[49:33] pit but we do have a person that we can
[49:37] follow that gave his life for
[49:44] you and that's the most admirable thing
[49:46] that you can see that a person ever did
[49:48] in this
[49:50] world if the world does not regard that
[49:52] as something admirable
[49:58] because they consider these little minor
[49:59] things that are senseless to be
[50:01] admirable
[50:06] things but just the thing that a person
[50:08] came down and then he gave him gave his
[50:11] life for
[50:13] you how can we not admire
[50:19] that how can we not say well I that's
[50:21] what I want to
[50:24] follow follow that person that gave his
[50:26] life for
[50:28] me he didn't he didn't care about my
[50:33] mistakes anything that I ever did he uh
[50:36] he erased it and he forgave
[50:38] it and better yet he only loved
[50:44] me even though it was our very human
[50:47] race that killed
[50:49] him nevertheless he still loved
[50:54] us I would like to keep reading in that
[50:56] message
[50:57] and looking unto
[51:01] Jesus paragraph told he says and you say
[51:04] I've done
[51:06] that it depends on what you looked
[51:10] at determines what you look
[51:15] at is where and what you look for him
[51:20] for what are you looking
[51:24] at what purpose do you have in looking
[51:26] at
[51:30] him it only depends on what you look for
[51:34] that's what you
[51:37] find well I can't say well I come to
[51:41] church I have my my life centered in
[51:46] Christ but the the real question that
[51:49] you should ask yourself is my life truly
[51:51] centered in
[51:53] Christ because it's one thing to attend
[51:56] church
[51:59] and it's something entirely different to
[52:00] Center your life in
[52:03] God it might seem that for someone else
[52:06] those two might be the same thing but
[52:09] they're actually
[52:16] different because you say well I do live
[52:18] the Christian Life I go to church I sing
[52:19] I participate I do all these
[52:22] things but why is it that you do
[52:25] it what's your reason for doing
[52:29] it do you just simply do it because
[52:32] everyone else does
[52:33] it or because you're told to do
[52:37] it or something that comes from your
[52:42] heart you've seen God in your
[52:44] life and you've
[52:48] said I do it because he did something
[52:50] for
[52:52] me he changed the path of my life
[52:57] and at the time that he did that for me
[52:59] why not then serve
[53:00] him why not then worship
[53:04] him if he changed what my past life
[53:10] was and then brother bam keeps
[53:14] saying it says it only depends on what
[53:16] you look
[53:18] for that's what you
[53:21] find and sometimes it seems
[53:29] and it's better yet it's not that we
[53:30] find him but he finds
[53:34] us because it was in the very moment
[53:37] that we had a
[53:40] need we didn't know where to find the
[53:44] answer we didn't know where else to
[53:49] look and depending what you're looking
[53:51] for that's what you will
[53:53] find if we can set an example
[53:59] just like when you're in a moment where
[54:00] you have a need in your
[54:02] life let's say you need
[54:05] money and you're you're lacking many
[54:09] things and you begin to look for
[54:12] jobs you go somewhere you go to a
[54:14] certain place you can't find it
[54:16] there you go somewhere else you can't
[54:18] find it
[54:21] there until you finally get somewhere
[54:23] you can find what you were needing
[54:28] you come to appreciate that certain
[54:30] thing because that's exactly what you
[54:32] needed it's the same thing in the
[54:36] spiritual we could have been lost in the
[54:41] world just uh wasting away in the
[54:44] privilege and all the pleasures that the
[54:45] world will offer
[54:48] you but then a time comes in the life of
[54:51] that
[54:53] people that that the things of the world
[54:55] can no longer fit
[54:57] them they feel such a void in their very
[55:01] being that they it's something that
[55:04] can't they can't
[55:06] explain he says well it's just maybe a
[55:09] strange
[55:14] feeling maybe just with a few drinks
[55:16] that I'll take I'll I'll get over this
[55:18] and I'll forget
[55:21] it I'll go out to a party with my
[55:23] friends and then I'll forget about the
[55:24] fact that I feel alone
[55:27] they do all
[55:28] that and then when they come back
[55:31] home they still feel
[55:35] alone maybe it's not because just
[55:38] because the house is is by
[55:42] itself but rather there's this little
[55:44] space within the human heart that is
[55:49] empty that feeling that the things of
[55:51] the world can't fulfill
[55:54] you and then truly they don't provide
[55:56] anything anything good for your
[55:57] life but then
[56:00] suddenly he found
[56:06] us for some reason or another someone
[56:08] approached you and and uh made the offer
[56:10] for you to come to
[56:12] church and and you'll see well I I'll
[56:14] see what it's about I'll see what
[56:18] happens and at that moment you don't
[56:21] come really expecting
[56:24] anything maybe you just came because a
[56:27] great friend inviting you you say well
[56:28] that's
[56:29] fine and sitting right there in that
[56:34] moment because God gives you what you
[56:36] need not what you
[56:39] want but rather what you
[56:45] need sitting right there in that moment
[56:48] maybe you were listening to every
[56:49] problem that you had in your
[56:52] life for every need that you were having
[56:54] throughout your life
[56:57] and then all of a sudden that
[57:00] void begins to be
[57:03] filled it becomes an unexplainable
[57:09] feeling because it became a feeling that
[57:11] it's a new found feeling that you never
[57:13] felt
[57:14] before that maybe it's something that
[57:16] you
[57:19] needed that's where you found your
[57:24] answer so that's where just like he said
[57:27] it all depends what you're looking for
[57:30] that's what you will
[57:31] find if you're looking for
[57:35] salvation God will give you an answer
[57:37] for
[57:40] that if you're looking for more
[57:43] faith God will answer
[57:48] that but it's also it's something that
[57:50] has to come from your
[57:52] heart to approach even more
[57:59] so that your heart your very eyes and
[58:01] everything can be set on
[58:04] God like uh personally I came in a
[58:07] moment in my
[58:09] life it's a really just like a small
[58:13] testimony in the year
[58:17] [Music]
[58:18] 2022 I went through a lot of different
[58:20] things in my
[58:24] life so I got to the point if God
[58:26] actually uh did
[58:32] exist and all of that began to grow even
[58:34] more because during that time I had to
[58:36] work so I really couldn't come to church
[58:37] that
[58:42] often so uh maybe throughout the whole
[58:44] week I would work from 3:00 to 10: at
[58:49] night and so Sundays too I would have to
[58:51] work from 3:00 to 10:
[58:57] so my mindset while I was in church is
[58:58] that I have to get out early because I
[59:00] have to go straight to
[59:03] work and truly during that time in my
[59:06] life go the things of God were just set
[59:08] to one
[59:16] side and during that time I was thinking
[59:18] well things are going fine for me
[59:20] because you know they tell you that when
[59:21] you leave God you leave church and
[59:23] things go bad for
[59:24] you but as time went
[59:29] on that that void began to come
[59:36] up but sometimes you really doubt if God
[59:39] is really with
[59:44] you and you might say well I come to
[59:46] church I serve him I've had my heart set
[59:49] on him but I've never really believed
[59:54] in like I've said before God is there
[59:57] but sometimes we can't see
[59:59] him but he's always with
[1:00:04] us so in that very same year of
[1:00:12] [Music]
[1:00:13] 2022 in the month of July when we went
[1:00:16] to the country of Salvador brother Marco
[1:00:18] Santana brother Lis
[1:00:21] agil it's that's when I began to go
[1:00:23] through all of that
[1:00:26] and when we got to El
[1:00:31] salvad uh my I was with my other brother
[1:00:34] my my middle
[1:00:36] brother uh not the one that's here he's
[1:00:38] the actually the
[1:00:45] eldest and I was with him it was H
[1:00:47] during the night before the the meetings
[1:00:49] the services that were going to be held
[1:00:51] over
[1:00:52] there and my brother said to me
[1:00:56] he says are you
[1:00:57] fine and I said yeah why do you
[1:01:00] ask he says I just wanted to
[1:01:04] know he asked how's your spiritual life
[1:01:09] doing and I think all I said well
[1:01:13] fine and he said he said are you
[1:01:17] sure he says well if I'm really being
[1:01:20] honest with
[1:01:23] you I'm having a lot of doubts if God
[1:01:25] really
[1:01:27] exists I said why do we even go to
[1:01:34] church sometimes I even come to think
[1:01:36] that I actually don't
[1:01:40] believe I've seen so many things that I
[1:01:43] really I haven't seen
[1:01:45] him and my brother began to talk with
[1:01:50] me because I even told him that I was
[1:01:53] thinking of I was getting to that point
[1:01:54] of thinking leaving church
[1:02:00] he began to talk to me and and he also
[1:02:02] prayed for
[1:02:05] me and he said he said God is with
[1:02:09] you but even though you can't see him
[1:02:12] he's he's there with
[1:02:14] you and then the next
[1:02:20] day that's when we went to the services
[1:02:23] there in in Salvador that were being
[1:02:24] held
[1:02:26] maros where brother Lu and brother
[1:02:28] Marcos
[1:02:31] preached first brother Lu preached and
[1:02:33] then brother Marcos
[1:02:36] preached and when brother Marcos went up
[1:02:39] to to
[1:02:42] preach he began to speak about his own
[1:02:44] wife's
[1:02:47] testimony and his testimony as
[1:02:52] well and the time came when he was done
[1:02:55] preaching
[1:02:57] that he
[1:03:00] said he says for all those young people
[1:03:02] that are having those doubts if God
[1:03:04] really
[1:03:05] exists he said if God is with
[1:03:12] you so what really surprised me and what
[1:03:15] impacted me is he said every single
[1:03:18] word that my brother and I were talking
[1:03:21] about
[1:03:23] before it was not just by chance
[1:03:32] and I was shocked and I I turned to look
[1:03:33] at my brother and my my brother was just
[1:03:35] sobbing in
[1:03:38] tears because he stated every single
[1:03:41] word that me and my brother talked
[1:03:46] about and that struck me so hard I I
[1:03:48] couldn't really have a reaction for
[1:03:52] that once we left the service
[1:03:57] my brother and I we were heading home
[1:04:00] and then he asked
[1:04:02] me he said did you listen to today's
[1:04:04] service see I said
[1:04:07] yes he said did you hear what the
[1:04:09] brother said
[1:04:12] yes he says that's the same thing we
[1:04:14] talked about
[1:04:16] yesterday he says there's your
[1:04:21] answer
[1:04:23] sometimes as I've said before
[1:04:28] he found
[1:04:29] us not we found
[1:04:32] him he sought for
[1:04:37] us and what other motive do you need
[1:04:40] just to worship
[1:04:44] him I'll keep reading
[1:04:47] here and the same message looking onto
[1:04:54] Jesus there's two two different kinds of
[1:04:56] eyesight that people can
[1:04:58] have and one is the real
[1:05:02] one in paragraph
[1:05:05] 14 he says many people go to the
[1:05:09] services and just to be
[1:05:14] seen and sometimes people go to services
[1:05:17] this is too bad to say
[1:05:20] this and we could Linger on it a long
[1:05:23] time
[1:05:28] but they go to church with their mind
[1:05:30] already made up before they
[1:05:32] go if certain things is
[1:05:37] said or something just against their
[1:05:43] idea against their their
[1:05:47] idea they'll get up right up and walk
[1:05:52] out they just simply will not stand
[1:05:58] because they've got their own
[1:06:00] idea what it must
[1:06:04] be like I said there's two kinds of
[1:06:09] eyesight for example like I mentioned
[1:06:12] before we could say well I come to
[1:06:15] church but you have your own
[1:06:18] idea of what you want to hear and as I
[1:06:22] said
[1:06:24] before God gives us what we
[1:06:29] need sometimes you get up Sunday morning
[1:06:32] you
[1:06:34] come and you say well today I want to
[1:06:36] hear about
[1:06:38] salvation today I want to hear about
[1:06:41] God's
[1:06:43] love or rather better yet I want this
[1:06:45] particular brother to
[1:06:50] preach because that brother has such a
[1:06:52] fire that he even makes me jump
[1:06:55] service
[1:06:59] comes they begin to say that we're
[1:07:02] Sinners because how we dress our
[1:07:06] mistakes and in your in your attitude is
[1:07:09] well I wanted to hear nice beautiful
[1:07:10] words not to be
[1:07:14] scolded and then the brother that's up
[1:07:16] there I really don't like how he
[1:07:18] preaches he's really boring the way he
[1:07:21] just does
[1:07:22] it but sometimes
[1:07:26] those uh reprimands or scoldings that
[1:07:28] we're
[1:07:30] listening maybe uh the
[1:07:34] reprimands are things that are happening
[1:07:36] in a
[1:07:38] life maybe it's not for
[1:07:41] you or for your brother that's to your
[1:07:45] side but there is a person in the
[1:07:49] audience that really needs to hear
[1:07:53] that to hear that that they would said
[1:07:56] that we were once
[1:07:58] Sinners that we were once
[1:08:01] lost but we were
[1:08:05] saved when we come to hear about
[1:08:10] God we can't come with a certain mindset
[1:08:13] on what to
[1:08:15] hear or try to reason God's
[1:08:19] word because God's word cannot be
[1:08:23] reasoned God's word is believe
[1:08:27] D well this what they're telling me it's
[1:08:30] really hurting
[1:08:31] me but it's the
[1:08:36] truth maybe physically I'm unable to see
[1:08:40] God maybe I'm just reading about
[1:08:43] God but even though I have not seen him
[1:08:47] I believe
[1:08:49] it and you don't start
[1:08:54] reasoning no you might say well what he
[1:08:56] said what he just said that's
[1:08:59] wrong that that's not
[1:09:01] right the Bible means this and
[1:09:05] that the messenger meant this and
[1:09:08] that people have their own
[1:09:11] idea they have their own
[1:09:15] reasoning but they want to hear what
[1:09:17] they want to
[1:09:20] hear but God is giving you what you need
[1:09:23] to hear
[1:09:26] but you need to see
[1:09:28] that we want to see with our own Earthly
[1:09:35] eyes and we're not saying that we have
[1:09:37] to see look and follow God with our own
[1:09:40] Earthly
[1:09:43] eyes but with your spiritual
[1:09:47] eyes sometimes you might say well I
[1:09:50] don't I don't get what he's
[1:09:53] saying I don't think he actually means
[1:09:59] that at the moment that you start seeing
[1:10:01] with your spiritual
[1:10:05] eyes you'll see and understand other
[1:10:07] things that you've never seen before and
[1:10:09] understood
[1:10:12] before but always remembering that
[1:10:15] God is not looked for with
[1:10:19] reasoning you can't search him with your
[1:10:22] just your
[1:10:23] reasoning you search him with with your
[1:10:27] heart and you believe him with all your
[1:10:32] heart that's the way to believe and see
[1:10:35] God with all your
[1:10:39] heart I would like to read this
[1:10:43] scripture Deuteronomy
[1:10:53] 429 Deuteronomy 4
[1:10:56] 9 when you have it you can say
[1:11:05] Amen do you have
[1:11:08] it God's word
[1:11:11] says it says but if from then Thou shalt
[1:11:15] seek the Lord thy
[1:11:18] God Thou shalt find
[1:11:23] him if thou seek him with all thy heart
[1:11:26] and with all thy
[1:11:28] Soul now notice what it
[1:11:32] says it says if thou seek him with your
[1:11:35] thoughts and your
[1:11:36] reasoning does it say that it doesn't
[1:11:45] right but it says rather if thou seek
[1:11:47] him with all thy heart and with all thy
[1:11:51] Soul that's the way that you seek God
[1:11:56] up above in the
[1:12:02] scripture it's speaks about the
[1:12:03] different gods of uh of uh wood and
[1:12:10] gold and that's what we said at the very
[1:12:13] beginning that there's thousands of
[1:12:17] gods but there's only one that we should
[1:12:19] look
[1:12:21] for and when you start looking for that
[1:12:24] God
[1:12:28] the way you should do is with all your
[1:12:29] heart and with all your
[1:12:32] soul let's keep reading in this
[1:12:36] message in paragraph
[1:12:46] 30 says Sometimes they come in a man
[1:12:49] will judge
[1:12:52] you by what kind of clothes
[1:12:58] if you don't wear ministerial
[1:13:00] clothes and so
[1:13:03] forth then that's
[1:13:07] out they won't have nothing to do with
[1:13:13] you sometimes they want to look to see
[1:13:15] what kind of education you
[1:13:21] have if you speak your words proper
[1:13:26] if you stand
[1:13:30] correctly how you use your nouns and
[1:13:36] pronouns frankly I don't know which is
[1:13:38] noun or
[1:13:40] pronoun I couldn't tell
[1:13:43] you so that's out for
[1:13:46] me and I just don't
[1:13:50] know I couldn't make the difference
[1:13:52] between a noun and a pronoun
[1:13:55] I did when I was in
[1:13:59] school but I have forgotten that a long
[1:14:02] time
[1:14:04] ago so it
[1:14:08] says so also people have their eyes set
[1:14:11] on different
[1:14:14] people they have their eyes set on every
[1:14:16] one of
[1:14:18] us how do I
[1:14:21] dress if they're dressing with the suit
[1:14:23] on
[1:14:27] well that brother he used that same
[1:14:28] shirt last
[1:14:33] Sunday people have their eyes set on the
[1:14:35] things of other
[1:14:38] people they have their eyes or their
[1:14:40] sight set on the lives of other people
[1:14:43] than in their own
[1:14:46] life when it shouldn't be like
[1:14:50] that we should be more concerned about
[1:14:52] our own life
[1:14:55] then how the brother is
[1:14:57] dressed if the brother believes the
[1:15:00] word if the brother lives the
[1:15:04] word be concerned about your own
[1:15:07] self if you live the
[1:15:10] word if you believe the
[1:15:15] word if you're truly dressing
[1:15:18] properly just worry about
[1:15:23] yourself if actually if we see a brother
[1:15:25] is failing
[1:15:30] somewhere if we have our life and our
[1:15:32] eyes set on
[1:15:35] God we know that the least that we could
[1:15:38] do is criticize the life of the
[1:15:42] brother because no one here is
[1:15:47] perfect or if you never made a mistake
[1:15:49] please raise your
[1:15:52] hand all that we have left to do is just
[1:15:55] to pray for the
[1:15:56] brother motivate the
[1:16:00] brother remind remind them that we have
[1:16:02] to set our eyes on
[1:16:08] someone and that can happen just as well
[1:16:10] with the
[1:16:14] Christian and as well the people in the
[1:16:16] world they have their eyes set on
[1:16:20] us they have a certain eyesight or
[1:16:22] expectation on what a Christian should
[1:16:24] be
[1:16:30] and the people in the world will notice
[1:16:31] carefully in every single detail of your
[1:16:35] life and if you make a mistake doing
[1:16:38] this they say well they supposedly
[1:16:40] they're
[1:16:42] Christian look at him he's listening to
[1:16:44] that kind of
[1:16:46] music saying cursed words and
[1:16:49] profanity dressing like
[1:16:52] that and he's supposedly a Christian
[1:16:57] and I say it because one time it
[1:16:58] happened to
[1:16:59] me not because I did
[1:17:04] something and but rather we were at
[1:17:07] school during
[1:17:09] lunchtime and it was about to be the
[1:17:11] graduation was
[1:17:15] approaching uh prom was going to was
[1:17:18] about to happen
[1:17:27] so my parents they raised me that a
[1:17:28] Christian doesn't mix himself with the
[1:17:29] people of the world one Spirit doesn't
[1:17:31] mingle itself with another
[1:17:33] spirit because what is a spirit going to
[1:17:37] do that knows what's right and
[1:17:40] wrong mixing in mixing itself in the
[1:17:44] things are that are just simply wrong
[1:17:49] things they have different thinking than
[1:17:51] we
[1:17:53] do well then
[1:17:57] so then they were uh we were talking and
[1:17:59] they asked you know are you going to
[1:18:02] prom and one was saying well I don't
[1:18:04] know I don't know what to
[1:18:07] wear I don't know who's going to pick me
[1:18:09] up give me a
[1:18:11] ride and then they asked me Abraham are
[1:18:13] you going no I said no and they said
[1:18:19] why it says I'm actually a Christian and
[1:18:22] I don't go to those things
[1:18:25] and that person got
[1:18:27] upset they began to say a bunch of
[1:18:29] things to
[1:18:33] me it says you Christians are hypocrites
[1:18:36] I've seen people that call themselves
[1:18:37] Christians they drink and they do all
[1:18:38] these
[1:18:40] things they go to dances and whatever
[1:18:44] more you think you're better than
[1:18:47] us you're the most hypocritical people
[1:18:50] that there
[1:18:53] are he says well I don't know what kind
[1:18:55] of Christian you've
[1:18:57] seen I don't know what person you
[1:19:01] saw but we are sure of one
[1:19:04] thing we're not
[1:19:08] perfect we have our own
[1:19:11] mistakes and I'm
[1:19:17] saying because all of us just like they
[1:19:19] told me you think you all of you are
[1:19:21] better than
[1:19:22] us it's not that we feel that we're
[1:19:24] better
[1:19:26] or we're believing that we're
[1:19:28] better we're just the
[1:19:31] same we're just
[1:19:33] different and they don't understand
[1:19:36] us they don't understand why we do such
[1:19:41] things or why we do such
[1:19:45] things but we're the
[1:19:48] same we're just simply
[1:19:52] Sinners trying to get out of sin
[1:19:56] struggling and fighting to
[1:20:00] improve fighting to get to a
[1:20:04] place because we don't want to just stay
[1:20:06] here on this
[1:20:08] Earth that's why we have to set our eyes
[1:20:11] on Jesus
[1:20:13] Christ he's our only way out of this
[1:20:18] Earth they have they're they're looking
[1:20:20] at different things than we are
[1:20:25] they're looking forward to uh reaching
[1:20:28] 200 or 300 years of
[1:20:31] life but we that have read the Bible in
[1:20:34] the
[1:20:36] message we know that we're very close to
[1:20:39] the very end when this Earth will come
[1:20:41] to its
[1:20:45] end if brother brandom about 50 years
[1:20:48] ago was saying that the world is falling
[1:20:52] apart that hardly anything was left for
[1:20:54] the Lord to
[1:20:56] come then how close are we
[1:21:00] today that's why we should be concerned
[1:21:03] on what we're looking
[1:21:06] at if our eyes are truly set on
[1:21:12] Christ and if better yet if our eyes are
[1:21:15] out of
[1:21:17] focus because sometimes doubts
[1:21:23] come yeah and sometimes you say well I
[1:21:25] well I'm still a
[1:21:29] Christian and then you go outside and
[1:21:31] then you say well the Lord will forgive
[1:21:33] me
[1:21:36] anyway I can make as many as a thousand
[1:21:39] mistakes in my
[1:21:41] life and the Lord will forgive me for
[1:21:43] every one of
[1:21:45] them by the way they always tell me that
[1:21:48] the lord gave his life for
[1:21:50] us that's another
[1:21:52] eyesight and that's even
[1:21:56] worse because you know the difference
[1:21:58] between right and
[1:21:59] wrong and then you still go for what's
[1:22:02] wrong and then you want to come back to
[1:22:04] what's
[1:22:06] right but when you come to
[1:22:10] God it has to be with a sincere
[1:22:15] repentance you truly repent of what you
[1:22:21] did not because the Lord will forgive me
[1:22:23] out of the way because I do come to
[1:22:25] church I serve here at the
[1:22:29] church it has to be heartfelt
[1:22:35] repentance because just like he said
[1:22:37] depends what you look at that's what you
[1:22:39] will
[1:22:40] find if you're looking for
[1:22:43] salvation you will find
[1:22:45] it but you have to be
[1:22:49] sincere sincerely seek it out from your
[1:22:51] very heart
[1:22:56] get to that very feeling where you feel
[1:22:58] that you can't live any more without
[1:23:00] having that
[1:23:02] salvation like David once said to
[1:23:06] God restore unto me the joy of my
[1:23:10] salvation he never lost
[1:23:13] it what he lost was the joy of knowing
[1:23:16] that he was
[1:23:18] saved the same thing goes with
[1:23:22] us we have not lost
[1:23:25] salvation it's just you have to seek it
[1:23:29] out you need
[1:23:32] it let it be something that comes from
[1:23:34] your heart for you to seek for
[1:23:38] it if you can please
[1:23:41] stand and the musicians can come
[1:23:46] up
[1:23:48] truly that's what we
[1:23:51] need our eyes to be set on God
[1:23:56] not
[1:23:58] carnally but
[1:24:00] spiritually to be
[1:24:04] concerned that your life is centered in
[1:24:08] God and to the young
[1:24:13] people I could say maybe there will be
[1:24:15] thousands of doubts that come in our
[1:24:19] life and thousands of remarks that come
[1:24:21] from other people
[1:24:25] that they we might come to say well
[1:24:27] that's
[1:24:28] true it's better for me just to leave
[1:24:34] church don't set your eyes on what your
[1:24:37] friends and everyone else
[1:24:39] thinks they will not save
[1:24:43] you the time will come that we will come
[1:24:45] to
[1:24:48] judgment and by then we would already
[1:24:51] know what was
[1:24:52] good and we de excited to get away from
[1:24:57] that so be concerned that your eyes are
[1:24:59] set on
[1:25:02] God don't follow other people or other
[1:25:07] things because a time of Darkness will
[1:25:10] come over your
[1:25:12] life that you will not know what to
[1:25:16] do and I don't I believe that no one
[1:25:18] wants to be in that state of
[1:25:21] desperation to look for God and you
[1:25:23] can't find anything
[1:25:27] look for God while he can still be
[1:25:30] found because a time will come over this
[1:25:34] Earth where everything will be
[1:25:38] closed you will no longer be able to go
[1:25:40] to
[1:25:42] church you can't look for God
[1:25:46] anymore but if you have already set your
[1:25:49] eyes on
[1:25:50] him you still have time
[1:25:55] because there's very very little time
[1:25:58] left so it I think it benefits us that
[1:26:01] we know where we're looking
[1:26:03] at let's Close Our
[1:26:06] Eyes our loving Heavenly
[1:26:10] Father Lord we thank you at this
[1:26:15] time for all that you've done for
[1:26:19] us but we also ask for your help
[1:26:25] we're asking that you show yourself in
[1:26:27] our
[1:26:29] lives and that you help us to
[1:26:31] [Music]
[1:26:33] change because salvation is already
[1:26:36] [Music]
[1:26:37] set all we have to do is accept
[1:26:41] it we're asking you
[1:26:43] Lord that you
[1:26:47] please help us to set our eyes on
[1:26:51] you and take our eyes off from the
[1:26:55] world but rather be more concerned with
[1:26:59] searching for
[1:27:00] you we
[1:27:02] ask Lord that you be with
[1:27:04] [Music]
[1:27:07] us thank you for what you've
