foreign you now do you care my brother william marion branham was liver sunday morning july 21 1963 at the branham tabernacle in jeffersonville indiana usa elements foreign let's remain standing just a moment now for prayer now with our heads bowed is there any spoken request or made known by just a lifting of your hand if you just raise up your hand that just holds your request now our heavenly father we are approaching thee again for these requests that they have their hands lifted into the air and they are needy this morning lord of many things it thou does know what they are thinking in their heart because you are the word and the word is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart is i pray the most gracious god that you will answer each of them according to their needs knowing this that thou will do it according to their faith give us faith as we speak thy word then lord may it bring faith to them help me to speak thy word for thy word is truth that it might bring faith to give answer to these requests and then there might be some here lord who has wandered off of that narrow way that's not walking in the truth of the way we pray father that something will be done today and made known that they will come quickly back to that path of fellowship again with christ the days are growing late evil is on every hand there's a great falling away and we pray father that you will make yourself known to us today by healing the sick in our midst performing miracles not that you have to do it lord let us know that you're god but because you promised to do it and we know that thou will grant to us your promises if we'll only believe them and know they are true we ask this favors in jesus christ's name amen it i was just taking a moment to read some of the requests laying here there's two or three one of them is a request for prayer of course there's many handkerchiefs laying here that we'd be glad to to pray over him just in a little while when we feel that the presence of the holy spirit is as at its peak that's when i try to pray over this when all the congregation all is anointed with his presence we're so sorry to bother have so many standing and not room for them to sit down and this is the day hot weather at its very peak of heat we're having about a hundred percent of humidity in about a hundred degrees so it's very sticky and hot much and i gave out this morning for healing services or not uh what reason i make that healing service because i put my faith in what he promised i cannot say that he will do it but i believe after hearing his word and basing our faith upon what he has promised then we have a right to claim his healing promises just as we do his salvation promises servicio de san nida these couple requests i don't know where they got the recorders going yet for this or not it might be uh good well i guess it's all right for the outside the public to hear this it's a request did you prophesy that there be a million negroes killed on the art did you just announce that there would be this happening [Music] or now see i've always asked you to be careful what you're listening to i think there's so much of it that it's just the human side but always if there is something that goes forth it will speak it it's thus saith the lord even to visions or anything ben the visions on the platform in the audience you are doing that yourself it isn't god it's you see god doesn't produce that vision you do it yourself by your faith in a divine gift no produces like the woman touched his garment he didn't know who she was or what was wrong with her but she did that herself see now that wasn't just saith the lord it was thus saith the lord when jesus spoke back and told her that her faith had saved her but see you have to watch i just was talking about martin luther king on this great disaster that they're having in the south with the the colored people i said if those people were slaves i'd take my church and go south to help them people out of slavery no sure would because man makes slaves not god we're all of one blood we all come from one tree and that was from adam god by one blood has made all nations and whether we our colors are brown or black or yellow or red or whatever it might be we are all creatures of the almighty see and there shouldn't be any differences in us yes the question down there is a segregation of school now i was there at the first uprise and i heard it and i i know from what i speak of the colored people has fine schools sometimes much better than the other schools escuela and for instance shreveport they got finer schools and the white school is but it's the idea of somebody inspiring them that they should go and mix themselves together which i think that it'd be all right but as long as the people are protesting those southern people then what difference does it make anyhow for example in shreveport escuela blanca and i think that martin luther king is communistic inspired which is going to lead about a million people to absolutely a death trap see i don't say the lord told me that i believe see and i believe it shouldn't be done i think that people are to be christians and recognize one another's brothers and but i think just because this united states this government now tells me that i can't even sign a check that's be give to me personally see that's constitutional rights taken from me but what can i do about it just go ahead that's all see it has to go through another system before i as a citizen united states can cash a check has that's not right that's unconstitutional but what what can i do about it there's nothing this tax collector down here someone told me i couldn't do it so well there it is if it is what of it so just let it go yes 960 i think it ought to be the same thing that the my colored brothers and sisters in the south ought to rise up to arms against their brethren and things like over such a little thing is that my what difference does it make if you go to school or what is i seen a fine colored lady that morning one that was they had the revolt there shreveport it was a an old colored minister kept telling militia he said let me speak to them and so he was a godly old man and he stood up there and he said i've never been ashamed of my color he said my maker made me what i am and i've never been ashamed of it but until this morning it was but so when i see you my people acting like this said then i'm ashamed of being a colored man there's a uh militia call hollering down says so some fine educated fine looking colored lady stood up with an intelligence my supreme she said the first thing i don't want my children taught by a white woman said why said because she won't take the interests of my children that my a colored teacher intelligence so look at our schools over here what are you hollering about so we got swimming pools and everything in our schools and they haven't got it over there so now what are you people hollering about and they hollered her down see hey greetings it's inspired of the wrong thing you see see they them people and that's reason i say that not that there is any uh any prophecy concerning it i have nothing on it from the lord and be sure now if i say anything from the lord like that to tell you it's always i'm speaking now but when he speaks i say it's not me it's thus saith the lord and i can't say it until he tells me that was i could be all together wrong in my thought about martin luther king i don't know i can't say that's just my opinion anything it rises up trouble that's what's supposed to be in the last days and it's all spot inspired of satan to break up our commonwealth and whatever we have anything that rises up like that yes so i'm far those people down there don't you never think that i'm not i i'm for freedom and for everything but the people doesn't have that situation under uh now but what it will do i believe it'll start another revolution if somebody doesn't stop it see it's the commonest working among those people live i was in africa when they've done the same thing see and i know there's communists coming there telling those colored people oh you're this that the other you're this that the other and the first thing you know it caused thousands of them to be killed and were they yet nowhere nowhere gustav in africa movement and i love human life let's serve the lord our kingdom is above nothing about this thing here long as we eat drink and can have what else do you want see so i know what it would be i realized that it just caused trouble now another question is here john the baptist when meeting jesus see what did he say thus it behooveth us to fulfill all righteousness what did it mean yes well i remember dr roy davis a personal friend of mine who baptized me the only time i've ever been baptized and he said that john was meaning i remember this in her school he said john know that he had never been baptized himself so he jesus uh john suffered jesus to baptize him well that i i different with the great doctor there bueno recorded dr not for controversy but for the sake of truth i might say this no there was two man the two leaders of the hour the messiah and his prophet met in the water controversial now remember john was baptizing not for remission of sins but unto repentance not for remission of sins because the offering had not yet been made there was no sacrifice and the sacrifice come to him in the water hola now notice john looking up and seeing jesus he said i have need to be baptized of thee and why cometh thou unto me jesus said suffer that to be so which it was suffer it to be so for thus it behooveth us or it's becoming to us to fulfill all righteousness then john being a prophet on who the word of the lord come comes only to the prophet john being a prophet understood if that was a sacrifice and according to the law that the sacrifice had to be washed before presented and that's the reason he baptized it he said thus it behooveth us to fulfill all righteousness the sacrifice which he was must be washed in the lava before presented for sacrifice and jesus was the sacrifice and john knew it and he knew that he must be washed before presented and then immediately edwards he was presented to the public for trial and was a sacrifice for all human life lord um now we're going to have a little short message and trusting the lord will grant to us his blessings now probably if i get back i'm leaving this next week to take the kiddies on a little vacation up in the hills and then if i if i get back in time we want to speak next sunday morning if it's permissible to god and to the pastor here we'll let you know this week farther you it's out of town by the way of letter hora probably is i want to speak on a subject of exactly why we believe the things that we believe about christ why it must be this way and cannot be no other way see and prove it by the scriptures christ if the lord believes it don't i'll try to see you this winter or next summer one when we get back if the lord tarries we're going now back home to arizona so get the children in school arizona now this morning just uh prior to the prayer for the sick uh we are going to read some of god's word which we know that without this word it's impossible there's nothing can be done and only the word can produce these blessings that we're asking for the sick and the needy just and i want to read some now from first peter the fifth chapter beginning with the first verse and then from the book of hebrews i want to read hebrews 2 the elders which are among you i exhort whom am also an elder and a witness of the suffering of christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be feed the flock of god which is among you take the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly not for filthy lucr but of a ready mind neither as being large over god's heritage but being examples to and when the chief shepherd shall appear ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not awake. likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the elder yea all of you be subject one to another and be not close and be clothed with humility for god resists us the proud and giveth grace to the humble equalment estas vestidos humble yourselves under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he careth for you um and in hebrews the second chapter we read these words now i'm pulling for giving for a text cast in your care i'm my text is he cares do you care enemies want to read this potion now while you're turning to hebrews 2 that you might see the the real meaning of these words what the what this text means therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip or if the words spoken by angels were steadfast and ever transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect our great salvation which at the first begin to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him god also bearing witness with both with signs and wonders and diverse miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will i want to use the subject here of he cares and do you when he was here on earth he cared for the people the thought of it rises in my mind just before speaking or praying for the sick not knowing just what kind of a of a prayer line that we'll have uh first it to approach this the audience must be anointed with faith if you do not have faith then there's there's no need of even coming to be prayed for because it's going to take your faith and my faith together my faith to believe in your faith to believe him john [Music] so we don't forget this now so go along we've got to have something evidently with evidence i mean that we can base our faith upon what we're trying to do necessarily because if a man approaches anything that he wants to do without sufficient faith he's bound to be a failure but if he can approach it with sufficient faith then he's bound to succeed if it is according to god's will and purpose to do it now i was thinking of him caring last evening somehow strangely i was led by the holy spirit when i was waiting on some fellows to come to help brother wood to put a a trailer uh he'd build on the back of his truck i didn't know why i was trying to find my good friend brother evans and i went i started up the highway which my wife and family studying back here knows it to be true and somehow strange that i turned around and went back to a place all how it thrilled my heart to see so many my friends gathered there in about two minutes time till it clogged the pathway the cars couldn't pass through no more just real friends driving for hundreds of miles from georgia and tennessee and alabama and all around just to hear a service tennessee come on my mind then what should i say to those people knowing that in the day of judgment i have to answer for what i tell them and i too am a i'm a lover of this great life that is to come and i i want to be there and then strangely i went to a place where i made a odd turn instead of turning around there i went up to make a turn the lights flashed on lovely couples on the outside two fine young ladies that i just married to to find young ministers and satan and whiter seen the minister one of them his ministry being set and he took a a life's companion right you're this altered they went away happily on the honeymoon and the enemy jumped on to this young man a company and i'm saying this to express what i'm saying does he care somehow with faith that would not take no they turned and returned back here knowing actually it was all way over in way in the east here somewhere on their honeymoon returned back and was sitting waiting and i walked in fine handsome young man his wife sitting on the outside crying her and their little companion and the other man and the other brother coming running which is a friend of this young man saying oh brother branham such and such has happened went there and seen this handsome young man sitting there just in the peak of his life a leader of young man sitting there in the satan bound him leader the homeless centa he never noticed but i took my hand left to shake hands with his hand right to see if some disease had plagued him but there was no sign of vibration coming right out of the room from praying and fasting and waiting upon the lord the anointing of the holy spirit was there and that's why it led us to establish and then seeing this shadow of darkness over him i never said what i was doing but in less than a couple of moments time it was all gone the coldness of his hands had left he was shouting and praising god a few minutes to find themselves and hear this set right here this morning sitting in the audience see how satan was trying to upset that young man by referring to him as some complex to be built back which the holy spirit knew and seen it by the vision of the lord but god cared for that man god cared for that young boy ben come on just coming in a few moments ago a lady i see her sitting here in the aisle with no or just got her seat somewhere and sat down she said nine years brother brandon i've tried to get a hold of you and she said i'm so desperate here late and couldn't even get a prayer card to be in the lineup billy of course it's his orders to see that i'm not bothered take me in and out don't feel hard at billy he's commanded by this board of trustees to do that and if you didn't i wouldn't be able to get to the prayer line getting here you realize that see there's got to be a system to whatever we're doing we we got to have it haciendo but him saying come on daddy hurry up this the lady moved back and she said brother bram just a word with you standing there a vision broke over this fine looking young woman and seeing that her heart was burned you're trying to work and make a living in a great thing happened back way back in the time of her parents that it caused this great thing to happen to her and the lord jesus revealed it and showed what it was and there in a moment's time took it from the woman caused she went around rejoicing and now sitting here in the audience with us now rejoicing with tears and she's wiping her eyes now knowing that the truth of the thing was made known and that what that poor little neurotic woman that was so nervous she didn't know what to do with herself and thinking that she was gone and there was no holy spirit and this is her last day she tried for nine years and she was about at the end of despair god cared for that little woman who no one cares for amen what a time he does care yes when he was shared on earth is to say he cared for the people so much until he healed their sick comfort their hearts told them about a a place that or he would go and prepare for them and would come again to receive them and to himself he cared for them and notice he cared so much until when he knowed he must leave in order to bring this great thing to us he said i'll not leave you comfortless but i will send the holy spirit and he shall continue my care for you until he returns there's no one cares like jesus knowing that his body as a high priest in the meteoral work that he's doing now that body must be in the presence of god at all times for intercession that god cannot see the sinner's sin he sees only the blood of his own son jesus is and knowing that he sent back the holy spirit to continue to comfort his people does he care certainly he cares continued now he was to continue to care for the people his people here on earth in the same manner that he cared for him when he was here because he said in saint john the 15th chapter if you want to make i've got notes laying here with these scriptures where i'm referring to saint john 15 26-27 i see many of you writing the scriptures down so i may refer to this if you don't know it many times to the scripture i write the scripture down that i know what i'm speaking of from here because it's always in the word of the lord land he said when the holy spirit has come who the father would stand in his name he would testify him in other words he would do the same thing he did the holy spirit working through a tabernacle that he had sanctified would do the same thing that he did now what that ought to do for us then we know that right among us today we have the same comforting lord jesus in the form of the holy ghost another office that god himself is working on it was a comfort to israel when they could look up and see the pillar of fire and here the prophets speak the words that was true and god vindicated that was their comfort israel he was a comfort when he was here on earth as a man god made flesh god representing himself and expressed himself through a man christ jesus who promised that the works that i do shall you do also represent now i'm going to the father and go to send back the holy spirit which will be me in spirit form and i'll be with you and dwell in you and the very same things that i've done here the holy spirit will do again in my name when he comes in for the spirit that's why i said to speak against that now after the atonement's already made was unpardonable sin to blaspheme the holy ghost and he would do it in the same way so that we would know whether it was a comfort from some earthly standpoint whether we know it was a comfort from some elderly person who could put their arms around us and hug us a little and make us feel good is or some a theological term of a denomination that would say now you belong to us and we got it and don't belong to the rest of them because they haven't welcomed he made this directly sure see he will speak in my name the works that i do will you do also when he's upon you see he would comfort in the same way by forgiving all of our sins healing all of our sicknesses and speaking to us of comfort of the kingdom that is to come hello see proving himself among us as god proved himself among us by jesus christ and in second timothy first timothy 3 16 it's written this way know about god without controversy we realize that great is a mystery of godliness for a god was manifested in the flesh we saw god in flesh christ that was god's comfort to know that he calmed so much he cared for us until he could become one of us god manifested in the flesh not just another person but god himself and now to make it another step closer he sends the holy spirit to care for our comforts and he abides in us oh it does care about now we must go on to another portion of scripture here or another thought to back this up before i go i might say this everybody doesn't have this comforter and they don't they don't have it so the reason they don't have it is because they don't accept it it's for them but they don't accept it now i hope that you're spiritual enough to to read what i'm saying see i'm speaking to a group of people that's to be prayed for in a few minutes and we have this comfort in holy spirit that sent far the comforter but all people won't receive that they don't believe in it personally [Music] [Applause] through [Music] um oh the sweetness of my lord don't you feel his love just pulling you right up close to him saying lord i love you i love you
