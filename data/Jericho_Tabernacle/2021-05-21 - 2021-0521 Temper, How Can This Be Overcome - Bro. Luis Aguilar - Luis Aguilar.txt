is there any spirit that's contrary to your word lord we rebuke it in the name of jesus christ may you be with us father we ask all these things in the name of jesus christ amen amen amen god bless you this evening it's nice to see you all here in the house of the lord if you be so kind if you can uh open up your bibles with me to the book of philippians the fourth chapter and the third verse el capitan thirteen el beres says i can do all things through christ which strengthens me you may take your seats amen a very simple scripture that i can do all things through christ which strength strengthens me if i could place a little sub title for our message this evening i like to entitle it how can this be overcome i was studying a little bit i had the books of conduct order and doctrine from the prophet established liberals and in the books you go to the very back there has there's a bunch of uh things where the the context or the things where he's mentioning and there was one that said temper how can this be overcome yes and i felt like the lord was speaking to me right there in this moment so i begin to just look up the word temper temperament [Music] and so i begin to notice that well i guess we're not alone i don't feel like okay i'm the only one who has this problem [Music] and the first thing that i thought in my head is that i can do all things through christ increase i i feel like i feel like with this verse i feel like we just read part of the verse i think we just read i can do all things maybe that's how i've been reading it he says i can do all things and i stop right there can i think that's where uh i begin to think i can do all things i can do all things whatever i want i can do all things i can't no puedo because i didn't finish the whole verse it says i can do all things they say christ in christ not by myself no your solo but through christ who strengthens me and i think that if we can just take that right there i believe that that would be more than enough because it does take us whatever we have says that i can't do it for them lord this is but through christ and i think that's very awesome i said well no wonder i can't overcome this no wonder i can't overcome the other thing one of my favorite stories is moses bellerin says that's one of his favorite stories too that's an awesome story imagine finally israel is in egypt's bondage it all happened abraham isaac jacob avraham isaac jacob then joseph hello jose sold his brother joseph goes to egypt then finally the israelites just stay in egypt a pharaoh rises up that didn't know joseph they're a people captive and finally god raises up a little boy by moses by the name of moses and oh how he his work how he was a lawgiver went up up in the mountains it stayed for 40 days came back out with the law sally that that the priesthood must die pass away so we see here he goes under he goes to egypt he finally he he kills an egyptian after he grows up brother said he could have done it so easy god could have done it so easy but god is so very particular in the way he does things that he could have just easily made moses pharaoh and let the people of israel go deliberate but the thing is you just get mad as a little boy you imagine little baby moses getting thrown a fit with his mom says but that was his problem he was growing up he never smoked he never the bible never said he smoked in you than the sickness that you that's in your that you have in your body greater is the power of christ and that little besetting sin that you can overcome after moses uh god took him to the desert it a is story he led him to the desert there for 40 years ran into a small church of jethro's little flock iglesias what brother ram says you know us did you ever study that right close moses had a temper that finally kept them out of the promised land that kept them away from the promised land we see him as a wonderful experience that he had comes down from the mount comes down from the mountain space change ah god spoke to him said go out there to my people i remember i made a promise to them and then he started saying well if they don't believe you then i will back you up imagine how i want you to notice by this time he was already married i'm going to go out there to egypt and i'm going to go and deliver god's people he appeared to me in a burning bush indicated the commission i'm going to go you know the promise that god gave abraham uh that the circumcision circumcision that everyone has to be circumcised while your son needs to be circumcised do you think sephiroth said it like that piensa de que se foreign he was talking to god's prophet like that hey imagine moses came down from the from the mountain make something new food and pack it up with lunch because i'm going to go to egypt now my mind works very tremendously that the first bibles were written by moses now moses i i god i know god know what to write in the bible but maybe moses kind of left out some things how he didn't how he didn't talk to her he only moses so he finally goes out finally and as the journey went on says that finally kept him out of the promised land from and god had him sent back out there and gave him a little high-tempered wife too tremendous i bet they had some trouble on the back side of that desert in front of everybody what are you talking about we gotta go do this first oh man god knows how to tame you down hey man god knows how to tame you down so he fixed him back out there with the little woman he was instructed in egypt you know all this engineering work and what was everything else and that still wasn't enough to calm moses down he knew how to calm his prophet down el salvia como tranquiliza take that temper out of him he knew how to take moses temper out by his wife that's why you young man you young sisters you're really praying and praying and praying and praying when you get sick of praying he praying moses was a clean young man says the mother of moses molded his character and moses had a lot of temper that was his trouble i can just imagine things wasn't so peaceful back there in the backside of the desert [Music] maybe god's trying to tame you down a little okay you see so vice versa maybe it's the vice versa the young lady you're trying to get tamed down he says doing he's trying to school the man's mind what what god pro what what the program of god is trying to train moses he had to take things at his own home first he can't go out there and speak locus into existence showing what what the program of god was program says the only time in the bible so here is god is trying to show moses the program moses and his temper gets to him strikes the rock and he broke the program but god still had to back up moses because that was his prophet he couldn't just leave him alone like that but that was the only time in the bible where he married this so i guess there was some little trouble on the backside of theirs or once in a while does maybe that's your cross god might have given to kind of keep you lined up same thing with you women to your husbands stick together question it was uh and uh questions and answers you can find this i'm gonna have it right up here here's the here's here's the question brother branham and mano branham when someone gets on me steps on my toes but the ramp says this might be a good one steps on my toes as the old saying is come on my temper rises how can i overcome this thing i know the lord will have to do it what can i do in my heart listen to the answer the prophet of god gives no much mind i don't guess there's there's too many people in this building i ever had any more temper that i didn't begin with brother branham had a temper element and if you have something that you can't overcome if you're if you're something that little besetting sin that you have es temper is get get a pack of sugar same thing with you sweeten yourself up endure not everybody is trying to fight you brother no so he cut off one of the lights of a lady this lady came out and says you blabbery blappery blap and he says brother braham said if you would have told me that before i was that before i was a christian christian i would have said some things and hear what abram says i thought i can never be a christian he said i thought i could never become a christian the el dijon [Music] you know the evils the evils that i have done when i was a kid i almost killed five men at one time una took a rifle loaded with 16 shots and when they when them boys beat me because i was a kentuckian porque that mom took one of one of his dad's the the the coat that he got married and he took that jacket made a pair of pants for brother brandon so you can go to school for the first time and they will make fun of him sometimes you go to school without a shirt some overalls their days made fun of him and his temper would just build up and a couple of boys because i walked down the road muchachos was some little girl and packed her books libros so he better carry the books of this little girl i had a little 22 winchester rifle rifle winchester laying up over the door reached up and got that rifle full of bullets went right down that kentuckian will realize where he's at from this one kentucky going on like that i step up with the hammer pulled back the rifle i said now which one of you want to die first which one are you going to die first wow that's the prophet he didn't say who's the first one who wants to get baptized no who's the first one who wants to accept jesus christ who wants to die first so you won't watch the others talk about a man of his word and i meant it he said he tween said he was gonna kill these boys and i meant it and then just then they started squealing and i pull and snap the gun snapped shells on the ground every one of them snapped and the boys went running and screaming and diving over the hill and everything now that's a temper put it back in the rifle talk about grace talk about grace he's going to protect you he has such a temper you get so angry that [Music] having a problem don't make fun of him because his dad was an alcoholic if it that's where i identify myself i is on the identification people made fun of me it's my dad was an alcoholic alcoholic because i was poor yo they was saying louise look at your dad and beating them i was telling the boys a while ago coming over i said how about we must be happy all the time god don't want you to be sad you know what ill temper does uh the 60 of the causes of all sicknesses about sixty percent of the sickness is caused by temperature and there you are getting sick and getting sick and getting sick and you have high blood pressure now you got diabetes you got something else diabetes yo because because of temper a causa del mar you might say brother i'm okay okay well put your little besetting scene and say settings how can this be overcome you have to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks i don't know what you understand what the prophet says i can place a quote right here we have five people every single one of us will understand in a different way that has already been conquered but brother branham tells me that the one that hasn't been conquered myself so that the greatest enemy i have the enemy the devil has been defeated by the bran says that's right this is like like all the old saints dead like jesus did midst of all of his enemies he's defeated it by surrendering himself he defeated it by surrendering himself why by the word you destroyed this temple and i raise it up in three days what the spirit says to the churches he that what the spirit says to the churches whatever you struggle with it doesn't matter what it is no important locations just lay it at the altar of god you struggle with your tongue you struggle with your eyes because you can't do all things but you can do all things just as long as it's through christ what a revelation that you can't do all things as long as it's with christ the holy spirit is right there yes the word is right there but you got to grab the holy spirit and let the holy spirit be the he can't but as long as you want it to be conquered the only one that gives the devil life the only one that gives temper lives and all these i gave them little little treats little snacks imagine you're there at the dinner table you got the white dog and you got the black dog blanco oh you're crumbs and other ones you gave it to the black dog i like the food i like going to church the tapes let someone is you have to understand the prophet nothing is quite professional just pray and pray and say lord i don't understand the message i don't understand the prophet but i can identify myself with the prophet identification is that an alien noise someone who's perfect i'll give him perfection he struggled too he wanted to talk to young ladies too he wanted to smoke too that mean he wanted to kill people sweet sovereign is he is a man of human flesh just like you and i did he cried at night because he was hungry he would go with his dad to go fetch some water to for the prohibition to make to make alcohol he had to take care of his siblings he knows how it feels to be a human como sientes romano just like you and i but just himself as well he had to
