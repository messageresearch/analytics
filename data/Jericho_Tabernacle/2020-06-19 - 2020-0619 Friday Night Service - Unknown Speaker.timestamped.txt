[22:03] the sixth chapter el capitolo says
[22:06] uh the 30th verse
[22:10] the 34th verse
[22:14] like to thank brother john alvarado for
[22:17] the
[22:17] opportunity once again
[22:23] for speaking to the to
[22:29] [Music]
[22:39] says wherefore if god so clothed the
[22:42] grass of the field
[22:43] which today and tomorrow is cast into
[22:46] the oven
[22:47] shall he not much more clothe you o ye
[22:50] of little faith
[22:52] is
[23:02] therefore take no thought saying what
[23:05] shall we eat
[23:06] or what shall we drink or where thou
[23:09] shall we be clothed
[23:18] and here it says parentheses for after
[23:20] all these things
[23:22] do the gentiles seek for your heavenly
[23:26] father
[23:26] knoweth that he have need of all these
[23:28] things
[23:34] but
[23:39] but seek ye first the kingdom of god and
[23:42] his righteousness
[23:44] and all these things shall be added on
[23:46] to you
[23:48] el
[23:54] take therefore no thought for tomorrow
[23:57] for the morrow shall take thought for
[23:59] the things of itself
[24:00] sufficient on to the day is the evil
[24:02] thereof
[24:11] now let us go to the same same book just
[24:14] to this 22nd chapter
[24:16] enemies
[24:24] [Music]
[24:28] to the 40th verse
[24:32] it says for master what is the great
[24:35] commandment in the law
[24:36] pregnant
[24:40] jesus said unto him thou shalt love the
[24:42] lord thy god with all thy heart
[24:44] and with all thy soul and with all thy
[24:46] mind jesus
[24:53] this is the first and great commandment
[24:58] is amen you may take your seats
[25:02] may god bless the reading of his word
[25:07] it's like once again it's really nice to
[25:09] be here uh
[25:12] very pleasant atmosphere
[25:18] i'd like to give a title to the message
[25:20] they today if you'd be appropriate
[25:26] i'd like to entitle it as first
[25:31] first something very simple
[25:35] doesn't matter what you do important if
[25:38] you're about to put some furniture
[25:44] [Music]
[25:52] there's always that first thing that you
[25:54] need to
[26:15] and so i always go to the scripture and
[26:18] i
[26:19] look up certain words
[26:36] but to me it is but i even had to look
[26:40] up the definition of the word first
[26:44] definition and it is it's coming
[26:48] first is coming before all others
[27:09] a lot of us sometimes we say well i
[27:10] don't have time
[27:15] the first thing we do is the what should
[27:16] be first
[27:20] it should be the first thing in our time
[27:24] and the first thing in our order
[27:27] like i said it doesn't matter what we do
[27:30] no important
[27:31] doesn't matter we're setting up some
[27:33] furniture no importance
[27:36] usually they come with instructions
[27:40] and they come in a numerical order
[27:44] and it says first
[28:14] so sometimes it's happened to me
[28:17] where i have to take it all apart
[28:21] and start in the first thing
[28:25] and the first thing usually is
[28:28] set everything in order the ponetto into
[28:31] order
[28:32] set everything in order ponton all of
[28:35] its bolts
[28:37] all the sizes all of the sizes of the
[28:41] the foots and whatever you want to do
[28:51] amen amen it doesn't matter what you're
[28:53] going to do an important
[28:55] if you're going to start courting a
[28:56] young lady
[29:01] and this isn't just isn't for the young
[29:02] men
[29:04] there's something you must do first
[29:09] it's everything has a first
[29:12] a lot of the times of the youth today or
[29:15] the couples today
[29:19] you know i had a co-worker there a lady
[29:22] that i work with
[29:26] and she started asking me what brought
[29:28] you down here so forth and so forth
[29:33] so i'm married and this and that is she
[29:38] said well you never live together
[29:43] no no i'm from texas
[29:47] i'll come out here i'll leave you
[29:50] and once i leave yeah i had to find
[29:52] another
[30:07] you don't have to live with her
[30:10] you got to know her character so forth
[30:13] and so forth
[30:15] what i'm trying to explain to you uh we
[30:18] want to go to the last step
[30:20] is
[30:33] to try if we are compatible
[30:44] and you can apply that to any situation
[30:49] amen do you love the lord now yeah now
[30:52] here in matthew the sixth chapter again
[30:56] here jesus is talking to us to his
[30:58] people
[31:01] he says he says don't worry about
[31:02] tomorrow
[31:06] don't worry about it of little faith
[31:09] don't worry about it
[31:12] it says i know that you gentiles seek
[31:15] after these things
[31:30] and he says for all these things you
[31:32] gentiles look after
[31:33] it
[31:37] but your heavenly father know
[31:40] it that you need these things
[31:57] and his righteousness
[32:40] not the
[33:28] because a lot of times we we like to get
[33:30] a job we want to get a house we like to
[33:32] get this and we like to get that
[33:37] and we want to start looking for a
[33:39] spouse and we just want to look for this
[33:44] but everything has its order everything
[33:47] has its time
[33:50] before we look for those things
[33:53] christ is saying i know you need them
[33:57] necesita i know you need a spouse second
[33:59] is it doesn't cause you i know you need
[34:00] your husband
[34:02] i know you need your wife second is it
[34:04] uh
[34:27] [Music]
[34:33] now if christ is telling us to look for
[34:35] something
[34:37] and obtain something we must do
[34:40] our research and see what he's telling
[34:42] us to look for
[34:46] amen amen oh yeah your mom's going to
[34:49] say you will go
[34:50] go to the store
[34:53] or give me this and give me that oh yes
[34:58] i don't know i don't know what you're i
[34:59] don't know what you're looking for
[35:02] ask her what is it that you want me to
[35:03] look for
[35:06] a lot of times where we're like i make a
[35:07] mistake and i bring her the wrong thing
[35:13] but we want to be right with the lord
[35:17] his righteousness what is his
[35:19] righteousness
[35:21] to be morally right
[35:25] the synonyms is to be in other words
[35:27] it's goodness uh
[35:43] [Music]
[36:10] because he's
[36:24] that do
[36:53] will that when jesus was on earth
[36:58] he taught his disciples everything
[37:03] how to pray to even how to act when he
[37:07] enters someone's
[37:08] house don't come in like this and like
[37:12] no
[37:12] come in respectfully
[37:15] jesus eve taught him every little detail
[37:18] of what they must do
[37:20] jesus listens
[37:31] he says that he taught the disciples how
[37:33] to pray okay
[37:34] associated
[38:02] but
[38:44] oh my god he's handsome
[38:47] guapo and you pray to the lord
[38:51] you say lord but let your will be
[38:54] done
[38:58] seek first the kingdom of god who is god
[39:01] and to enter in this kingdom you must do
[39:05] his will
[39:05] that is complete and when you pray for
[39:08] his will
[39:10] it hurts willy
[39:14] well lord is she so pretty
[39:18] that car oh with the oatmeal oh my gosh
[39:22] but let your will be done let your will
[39:26] be done
[40:19] hey man do you still love the lord i
[40:21] mean i'm an el senor you still
[40:24] amen now my base scripture is in first
[40:28] kings
[40:32] and the 17th verse
[40:36] you don't have to open it if you don't
[40:37] want to no
[40:39] i'm not going to read it i'm just going
[40:41] to make emphasis
[40:44] and here in the scripture it's talking
[40:47] about
[40:48] elijah already the tisch bites
[40:52] he was the prophet in the time when
[40:54] jezebel
[40:55] and the king ahab
[40:59] and on the 17th verse
[41:03] elijah stood before ahab
[41:07] and he said as the god of israel liveth
[41:12] before whom i stand
[41:16] there shall be no dew nor rain these
[41:19] years
[41:20] but these years but according to my
[41:23] words
[41:27] now the elijah standing before the king
[41:32] and he was bringing forth judgment and
[41:34] he said there will be no rain
[41:37] until i say that's the prophet speaking
[41:41] all right until god says
[41:46] he says according to my word
[41:50] that's good that's good stuff isn't it
[41:51] this is rico now elijah he fled
[41:54] he went to a cave uh elias
[41:59] he went to the brook el fuego
[42:27] and and elijah was there yes
[42:31] and he started to notice that the brook
[42:32] began to dry up
[42:36] because he commanded the heavens not to
[42:38] reign
[42:42] and the lord spoke to elijah el senor
[42:45] and he says get up you say levanta arise
[42:49] and go to zerabeth if we are sick of it
[42:52] go up there because i have commanded
[42:54] a widow woman there to sustain thee
[43:25] hot son he didn't know what what a woman
[43:29] was
[43:30] which woman was it the lord didn't tell
[43:34] him it's going to be this one by the
[43:35] name of this
[43:38] uh
[43:50] you know fetching some fetching some
[43:52] some firewood
[43:57] and here eliza elijah here i'm going to
[44:00] read the scripture
[44:02] on the tenth verse so he arose and went
[44:05] to zera but then when he came to the
[44:06] gate to the city
[44:08] behold the widow woman was there
[44:09] gathering the sticks
[44:11] and he called for her and said fetch me
[44:14] i pray thee a little water and vessel
[44:16] that i may drink
[44:31] and she said as the lord thy god liveth
[44:34] i have not a cake
[44:35] but a handful of meal and a barrel a
[44:38] little oil and a cruise
[44:40] and behold i am gathering two sticks
[44:42] that
[44:43] i may go in and dress it for me and my
[44:46] son
[44:46] that he may eat and die yeah
[45:16] and her young one is stomach cake
[45:20] because she hasn't eaten
[45:23] and he will say mom i'm hungry
[45:27] we haven't eaten and brother graham said
[45:31] the little boy would go up to the pantry
[45:35] and you open it there was nothing to eat
[45:40] and as a mother or as a parent
[45:44] it would just break anyone's heart
[45:49] to notice that your kid
[45:52] will grab his stomach my stomach hurts
[46:11] said that she was a widow this is
[46:15] and her husband was a soldier
[46:19] and her soldier brother says and the
[46:21] message why we're not a denomination
[46:23] yes
[46:43] she was no longer bound to the law of
[46:45] her husband
[46:47] [Music]
[46:48] she was no longer bound to the
[46:50] denomination
[46:53] so she was open is
[47:36] but
[47:51] what an honor to receive elijah
[47:55] oh it's amazing to receive the pastor at
[47:58] your house
[48:02] your house is
