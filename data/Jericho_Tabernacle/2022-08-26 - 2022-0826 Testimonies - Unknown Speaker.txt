[Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] it was a surprise that i was going to ask that i was going to speak first i told my husband that they wanted to give a testimony but unless there was nobody that put god on the list [Music] i want to thank the lord for all of his blessings i asked the lord to return to me the joy of my salvation on friday i sang the special campaign [Music] and during the campaign i would ask the lord to help me to get rid of those things so i can get closer to him [Music] and on friday brother anthony who he spoke he spoke on specific scriptures that were important to me um and on saturday when brother matas preached my daughter wouldn't let me enjoy the service i was outside the majority of the time nope i heard some few things but i couldn't grab my whole thoughts together and i said well maybe i won't receive anything but that's fine there was a prayer line that went up but i didn't really feel the need to go up and towards the end i filled the pool and i left my daughter with the sister and i went up um i was being sincere with the lord telling the lord things that were on the way of me serving him he and when the prayer line started i asked the lord to take those things away from my heart and asking for the joy of my salvation my brother grabbed my hand and gave me the answer when i was waiting from the lord [Music] and then a brother spoke in tongues and i lost control of myself i received from the lord established and i just asked forgiveness from the lord the things that were bothering me and my in the past [Music] and the brother who was preached on sunday el dijo and the lord told me the song that you sang on friday that's for you not to see everyone else but to live and [Music] and i feel led to speak to my sister anna what's next to me e cuando i went to the altar once again i asked forgiveness of the lord once again i want to thank the lord for answering all of my questions can you return the joy of my salvation [Music] and sometimes we see the people and that makes us get out of the path and once we came back or my sister anna sent me a message and she told me the same exact thing she said that song that you sang was for you i want to thank the lord god bless you [Applause] and coming to camp i was asking god that if he could heal me and i had that i had that on my mind the whole camp and so um on saturday in el salvador i had started to feel like anxious and depressed and i was very i was being tormented in my mind and so i went to my cabin to to take a nap because i was like oh i'm just tired of so i i went in there and i was like i can't sleep though i'm not tired and i was like let me try to listen to some music just to calm down but even like behind the music i could still feel being tormented so i said i'm going to listen to a tape and i had um because it was like no internet i had a list of tapes downloaded israel and the church number three israel the indictment hebrews chapter 3. and then the one that i ended up choosing was a court trial so i listened i started listening to the tape but quickly after i was called to practice with the youth and while i was practicing i did not want to practice i felt like i was just fighting with myself and i i felt so like i just didn't want to hear the music i just wanted to be alone and i want to thank sister brianna and hannah for keeping me going and giving me words of encouragement and so after we finished practicing the song i went back to my cabin and i thought i'm going to finish the tape and i started listening to the tape and i was kind of asleep and kind of awake but i heard brother branham say something about healing and he prayed for some young kids and it just made me cry and in the cabin i couldn't stop crying and i didn't understand why but after i knew that it was god telling me that i was going to be healed and then we went to service and hearing um at the all at the when they were praying for me i felt like i was delivered from all the anxiousness and and all like that i had felt being tormented and i felt this just like blanket of like um like calmness and i i had gone to camp and i i we came back and i had still not i didn't really see what i came for but i got what i needed gave me what i needed and words of encouragement to to keep on going and go through the trials and i forget which brother but the brother was talking about how you can be um like seeing god from a distance but you're because i felt like i was going to church and i was i would go to church every day and i would like follow and like wear skirts and everything but i wasn't really getting to know jesus and that was something that really helped me to to keep pushing forward and so after after camp well today i was writing the testimony and i had just finished writing it and then i found out that that my health problems were healed i just want to thank god for that and thank you for um everyone who had been praying for me for me i want to thank the lord for allowing sister connie to come because i felt like she was such a blessing i felt like she was something someone that i needed to talk to she gave me a lot of words of wisdom and thank you [Applause] to speak about a testimony that happened to me while i was at camp testimonial i have i have a verse and a message that really spoke to me in isaiah 9 2. it says the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them half the light that shined and in the message jubilee year paragraph 61 brother branham says you can you can't do it yourself but i know someone who can break it for you the lord jesus christ has come to make you free so going to camp thursday afternoon to be honest i wasn't in the right mindset i also wasn't in expectation as i should have been i was tired and stressed from school and also not really feeling like myself i honestly already wanted to go home i was anxious to meet new people and even anxious on what god was going to say to me through the preachings however saturday night that all changed for me i'm sure anyone who is present saturday night can also agree on how strong the spirit was that evening even before instead of feeling relaxed i was anxious and after the preaching was over the spirit began to move throughout the tent i could feel my brothers and sisters receiving something special from the lord and i felt strong emotions but i tend to keep them inside and touched until i couldn't hold it in and my tears poured down my face i put my face into my hands and i started weeping uncontrollably all the emotions i kept in every bit of anger jealousy and fear came flooding out and that's when um my sister daniella spoke some words to me that i feel were straight from the lord for me and once all those negative emotions left me negative i felt an overwhelming sense of love and forgiveness something i haven't truly experienced in my life i felt an unconditional love to know that even if you put up walls god will break through and come and find you god [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] nemesis [Music] oh foreign [Music] is [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is is [Music] um i just wanted to give a short testimony i know there's a lot to say but i just want to hit the highlights i want to give thanks to the lord for allowing me to go to campus [Music] there was so many blessings there so many things that helped me and encouraged me just through the services and um the fellowship and um just being out in nature but the thing that really um stuck out to me was on saturday night i went through the prayer line and i went with uh with faith in my heart and um i really couldn't i was just praying i couldn't no words would come out of my mouth and as i was walking through i just felt so much love from the brothers i felt so encouraged and just lifted up i felt like i entered their dragging on the ground in and they were lifting me up and giving me encouragement and there was a couple brothers ministers that began to tell me everything that i had been asking the lord and uh they told me things that i only told god and they just began to tell me and prophesy to me that the lord was going to help me and he he knew all about what i was going through and they told me all the details of the things that i was asking the lord i know the lord hears our prayers they pray for you and they speak life over you yeah [Music] and they tell you that you're going to have the victory that all will be well and there's just nothing like that that message from the lord so i just feel really grateful to god and it gave me the strength to continue on and i think the words that stuck out to me from the minister that was discerning me he told me that my sorrow would be turned to joy and i really thank the lord for that god bless you [Applause] [Music] [Music] blessed assurance [Music] all lives things may seem so impossible but i know god cannot fail just look back and see how many times you were at your end and god delivered you with his mighty hand blessed assurance [Music] is [Music] just look back and see

testimony testimonial of my experience how i experienced camp como experience and the things leading up to it um so i'm starting off i could i could just say i'm blessed to be around each and every one of you [Music] that alone is encouraging you know you could if somebody from the world were to go by and see us they might think we're a little crazy why are these people just you know they're so happy and so motivated but being on the inside you know being on the inside and and fellowshipping with you guys it's beautiful it's something like the song says you know there's no words words can't explain it you know starting off uh you know i got there a day early i really enjoyed brother anthony ham when he spoke i believe i had met him a few weeks back and i went to new mexico [Music] so i never expected him to bring the message that he brought you know i i went to camp um kind of hurt i was a little wounded i think a lot of us kind of felt like that going there i felt like a soldier that was uh doing everything he could when i got there i when i heard brother anthony speaking it was very encouraging me kind of opened my eyes up he read galatians uh 524 hello it says i believe it says paraphrasing here it says uh those that are christ have crucified the flesh and i believe that was very [Music] direct to me i felt like i had been attacked and been being challenged by the devil being a christian cristiano we are looked at differently you know this world is so um there's no hope for the world although although jesus christ god gave his son jesus christ we live in darkness you know our children i i don't consider myself a young person i can imagine our children the children you know it's very um it's a dangerous world that we're in it you know it's way later than what we think there's nothing else that's going to help me unless i stand on god's word and even then even though we're on god's word we're still going to be getting attacked on the daily you know i asked for your guys prayers i really i really want to serve the lord with my heart and i feel like i feel like my mind tells me it's impossible what can i do but you know there's nothing else that's going to help me nobody can help me you know i if i can go back to my my little timeline i was given you know brother anthony um kind of remind me of my dad how how he spoke emmanuel anthony me come and you know and when the prayer line came the next the following day and then also the on sunday domingo we have to take we have to take what's ours you know we have to possess it you know i believe that um no one's gonna no one's gonna fight for us not and you know when i made that choice i didn't expect to fall down so many times but all i can do is get back up stand at god's word keep moving forward you know if i stick to god's word all of my problems start falling away i know i have journeyed i've walked with the lord i began my past but it's so easy to just go to one side or the other but so we got to get back up and continue forward you know i can't emphasize or i can't express that i feel like i want to i want to grab somebody and shake them and you know stand on god's word there's nothing else that's going to help us i'm not very good at speaking but if i can express myself and i appreciate everybody's help all the talent and everyone that went to the camp i think that you guys are all special people okay and i'm blessed to be around you guys um you know and like i said just keep me in your prayers let's let's make the circle a little bit tighter not smaller but tighter i question let's not let the enemy uh take us down or come into our our circle right now i think that we are all on the same idea that we're fighting for and we all got a little fire that we received over there let's uh let's do what our well if we are hesitant to do something let's not think about it let's just do it okay in god's name right i feel like a lot of us that's what we were doing at camp we were saying you know what it's camp and it's a special moment let's just let's do what we can to help i feel like we could bring that idea home and just keep helping each other out so um i love you guys thank you for sharing the ear hermanos thank you for listening to me speak gracias and thank you very much god bless you [Applause] [Music] yes [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] m [Music] me [Music] [Music] me i'd like to start with the scripture john 16 20 to 23. verily very i say unto you that ye shall weep and laminate but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy a woman when she is in travail has sorrow because her hour has come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembereth no more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world and ye now therefore have sorrow but i will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you and in the day ye shall ask me nothing verily verily i say unto you whatsoever ye shall ask the father in my name he will give it to you um i think it's amazing that i picked this scripture and i just heard sister sharon say that her sour her sorrow shall be turned into joy they asked me to share a small part of my testimony over what happened at this past jericho camp and the devil started finding me as soon as he heard i was going to testify yesterday my car's engine overheated and i started feeling a little sick but don't worry it's not covered you know i wish i could sing or play an instrument to glorify god but i can't not very good but you know what so and i would say yes i'm coming with expectations i had some things i was struggling with and i knew at camp i would receive something from the lord during camp i was grateful to meet new people in fellowship during fridays in saturday's service when brothers anthony ham and judah mata were preaching during both preachings i was just crying because everything they said touched me okay but during saturday's service i received a lot of confirmation and answers to things i was struggling with my heart started beating super fast and i just felt a call to go through the line and as i was walking through it hearing what the brothers were saying made me cry even more i was already crying the whole service but as i continue to walk through the line towards the middle of it is when brother albert delgado ain't el medio alberto delgado said something to me and i just started crying really hard he pulled me aside and started discerning me one of the things he told me was just to open my heart fully to the lord and then he prayed for me towards the end of the prayer he put his hands on my forehead and he casted some things out i was struggling that's when i felt so light and liberated i fell back i would like to thank the sister who caught me and helped me back up after i was done praying on the floor that's when i continued to walk and a couple steps after falling my hands and arms started to shake really hard miss manos and just covered my face with my hands and kind of leaned over and i just kept crying and i was praying thanking the lord my face in my head felt super hot like fire meet me after i calmed down i felt tired and drained like i couldn't get up so i just stayed there worshiping god listening to the music [Music] you know i come from the world and there's no better feeling than the presence of god [Music] never in my life i'd imagine i'd be here but by god's grace and mercy i'm here you know it's like eating at mcdonald's your whole life and then getting to eat at longhorn steakhouse longhorn steakhouse why would i ever want to go back to mcdonald's this monday was my one year mark of being baptized is i was born 19 years ago but really only been living for one year and i thank god for this beautiful year for all his mercy revelations and experiences he has given me grace as my favorite song says just remember when you're standing in the valley of decisions and the adversary says just hold on our lord will show up in phoenix january 21st 1962 in phoenix what you need is the holy ghost to deflate you a little bit that's right let you know that the real true baptism of the holy ghost will make a tuxedo suit put his arms around a pair of overalls and say brother right real old time salvation [Music] he's going to have a bride that hasn't got a wrinkle in here amen she's wholly washed by the blood of his own self that's right so we see where we stand the wedding's getting ready to come
