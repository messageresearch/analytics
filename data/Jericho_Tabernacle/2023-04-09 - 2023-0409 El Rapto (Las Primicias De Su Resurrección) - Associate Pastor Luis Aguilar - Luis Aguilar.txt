within me so we're waiting at one of these mornings the resurrection amongst the dead so my question for every one of you do you want to live worse or better [Music] let's open up our scriptures First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 20. our pastor right now is in Mexico City along with our brother Manuel Santos and Juanito yeah I believe that tomorrow they'll be coming back so let's pray for them that they can come with all will First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 20. you have it Brothers man Ado de los Muertos premises but now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that sleptos for since my Man Came Death by man came also the resurrection of the Dead [Music] for as in Adam I'll die even so in Christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order Christ the firstfruits afterward they that are Christ at his coming being very happy you've given us life Lord father prepare us Lord are you are you going to start at least to Senor help us to be ready Lord we know the Bible we know the message we know the signs we're not an ignorant people so father help us to get ready to express the word in such a simple way that's what people might understand it help us Lord you can resurrect in every one of our hearts so that we can be there that day of Resurrection when the dead in Christ shall foreign [Music] he can take it only God amen Brothers I just want to stay there because I just feel so happy this morning this morning I'd like to speak on the Rapture and the first fruits of his resurrection here in the book of First Corinthians in verse 12. I'm not going to read it emphasis I'm going to make an emphasis is telling us the guy said some among you can speak about the resurrection something that was faked and that was being spoken amongst us or if there's no resurrection of the Dead which we are waiting foreign verse 15 foreign I would uh Miracle of Senses Colossians 1 15. he said El is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature of the invisible God Amen Brothers we look in the scriptures there's people that say the invisible God Amen Brothers we see that with Moses and God allowed him to see the back of a man and being a man I say what a privilege it was myself the God's back I would have loved to seen God's back foreign [Music] [Music] the firstborn of every creature he's the firstborn among the Dead the first fruits and then the others come about now in this glorious scene that we have before us tonight primavera is Jesus up from the dead in springtime caminando walking around up from Spring the Resurrection The First Flower arrives from the dead our lord Jesus he was the first fruits of them that slept the Easter flowers the first one that stuck its head out after the cold midnight of darkness and sins price and God raised him up on the third day we believe this is God raised him up on the third day according to his promise and we believe it according to the scripture that he raised up the Third he was the first one that raised up from the dead the first fruits are the ones that sleep Jesus now we see the Lord Jesus Christ was crucified the scripture says he went to hell he went in priests and he took captivity captive and so in the old times in the Old Testament all the saints sacrificial the animals they make animal sacrifices they were forgiven under the blood of that animals so then what would happen with those Saints where would those Saints before Jesus Christ where would they go they go to the sixth Dimensions to the presence of God where did Abraham when he died say to A Place Called Paradise amen brothers that's why when Jesus was nailed to the cross that sinner was on his side and he said Remember Me didn't have time to be baptized I didn't have time to join the church today into Paradise with me in the Old Testament that did not go to the presence they didn't go to the sixth dimensions an adulterer like me you love God Brothers these men were under the blood of those of those animals they could not enter with God those Souls were just stored like that land of sleep until the Lord Jesus came and then his perfect blood unto the presence of God they were captive and waiting that's why the prophet says if you know your Bible the prophet says the reason that the witch offender could call the spirit of Samuel you remember the prophet Samuel died and what did Saul do you want with the witch okay and don't ever go with those witches you want to know your future how many children am I going to have let's get let me get my palm read okay read that sphere that ball that they read you want to know your future if you serve God you go with God you don't serve God there's your future Brothers they didn't have to pay a witch for the blood of bulls and goats could not take away sin but since Jesus died that's why these saints were there in a place called Paradise now let's go to Saint Matthew I hope you got your Bibles this morning good soldier always carries his Bible amen Brothers and San Mateo Matthew chapter 27 verse 50. Jesus Jesus when he had cried again with the loud voice the Lord Jesus he cried with a loud voice the scripture tells us in Thessalonians the voice and the Trump of God who is the one doing that the Lord Jesus he's the one that's doing it bring in the message the Lord Jesus he said he cried again with the loud voice the shout gondos and the temple was from the top to bottom of the earthquake and the Rocks rent how many believe that the Earth there was an earthquake [Music] I can't remember which mountain it was forgive me I can't remember what mountain or Canyon it was okay okay so you know that Sabino there there were two stones that fell he said and they got stuck together when the Lord Jesus a rose who the prophet has told us so then from here in Arizona this broke the whole Earth when the Lord Jesus Christ the prophet says there's two rocks and they both crash and there's like a a path under how many of you have been there a man now the scripture says and the graves were open and many bodies of the Saints which slept a rose the Lord Jesus first arose along with the sinner first and they started to arise in their order now my questions and you can think about it tomorrow and think this morning after the Lord Jesus in the scriptures who was the second and just meditate upon it he says he and it says after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared unto many how tremendous right and appeared unto many fourth [Music] and they started to appear unto many amen Brothers that's why the Saints in those days don't bury me anywhere else the Saints wanted in the resurrection they believe Joe believed in the restaurant Abraham believed the resurrection that's why in Genesis all the services that Abraham says he said I got all these kingdoms me just worship me oh no he said no I'm going to pay for it and then Abraham was married there Sarah all his children that's why Jesus said Joshua said and Joseph and Joseph said in Egypt don't you bury me here in Egypt don't bury me here yeah take my bones near to Palestine because my grandfather Abraham they knew that the resurrection was going to be in Palestine so don't bury me here now imagine Karen Joseph's body the Red Sea open they're carrying Joseph's boat that's what the prophet says he said Bury Me Not in Palestine a cemetery or a cemetery you can be buried anywhere just bury yourself in the Lord Jesus amen no the cemetery is Anointed God will raise you up Palestine Prophet said only them Christo that are in Christ how can we enter with Jesus you've got to be born you're born in the Bible you can find it in First Corinthians a que hora Academy what was the time where the Lord went to Paradise what time what hour he was crucified he went to paradise and what time was it the prophet tells us right the prophet says like this Prophet says Abraham and them they're in Paradise maybe sing in a good song that morning in the message God perfect in his church he said like at two in the morning here on the earth he went and knocked at the doors of paradise like two in the morning he went and knocked at the door onto Paradise amen Brothers now he says now we see the prophet says Israel in in the Red Sea El mourio he died his soul went down into him he preached unto the soul and prison souls to death unto the devil is and he came back on Easter morning and he came through Paradise he knocked at the door Prophet says I can hear him say children Abraham saying who is that I am the stone that was cut out of the mountains the Old Testament Saints waiting to be clothed upon in Paradise are we going now he said it's time let's get out foreign listen then they say we're recognized like when you went through the walls and you know they didn't even know or seek when he come in glorificados they had glorified bodies they appeared back on Earth for a first roots of the proof of God's power and the resurrection principalities took death in hell and they're on Easter morning and they entered in the Kingdom with him if you notice the prophet's glorified bodies we have three bodies the Earthly foreign the scripture says in First Corinthians that he appeared to more than 500 people at the same time don't you know what's happening this man arose from the dead so these ones they went home they start to eat with him and the scripture tells us there was one sign to recognize the Lord Jesus when he was here on the earth when they gave them the bread when he took the bread and then break it he left he left their eyes could not see that it was him but at the same time he could go through walls behold so you see my flesh see my blood see my bones a spirit cannot do these things when he said that is the other question that he had do you have something to eat and this before [Music] you speak to his disciples the first question you've got something to eat the scripture says that they gave him some fish grilled fish it wasn't just raw fish it was grilled and then put a little lemon on top of the fish it was cooked that's what the Bible says so that he could eat when the first fruits in the dead arose they also ate I can imagine that raises up in the resurrection he's going to say give me a taco some cactus spicy chili right and El Salvadoran will also get up too maybe they'll also raise up two years with some very bitter coffees some strong coffee because they're hungry it's a body and eat the pride is blessed everyone else is your Resurrection that's biblical you happy Brothers the prophet tells us that there's six raptures three raptures in the Old Testament three raptures in the New Testament what are those raptures then Elijah then it was the Lord Jesus Christ but those that were in Paradise the prophet says that the Lord Jesus Christ was the Keystone that's right in the middle between the old and the New Testament amen Brothers the first Rapture of the New Testament and also and then the Rapture that's going and we're waiting and what is the other Resurrection the first don't doubt it don't doubt usted young brother and sister the first resurrection that's why the largest crisis that all will raise up amen amen Brothers in the end everyone will raise up but the last shall be the resurrection of condemnation we just read in Matthew he cried with a loud voice and the resurrection and we're ready we're waiting for that shout the resurrection so if the dead in Christ can rise up first who does it who does those three things the Lord Jesus now my question to you is how will the tombs open up will there be tombs open all over dirt all scattered around have you ever thought about that imagine driving around and just see the tombs all dug up you'll say oh how tremendous the prophet says the message God hiding himself in Simplicity then revealing himself in the same and when they say the Grays will open how are the graves I don't have time to explain it I'm going to jump over to save some time the prophet says God just speaks and the Rapture will come noise it ain't going out there the Angels come down with shovels up the graves to get the old dead carcasses here what is it was born in sin to begin with that body it's a body we've got another body ready glorified body of perfect that's waiting foreign a secret it's a secret no one else will know about it I want to say something but I'm holding back no I said a new group chat it won't be in a group chat I said Secreto I see because he said he'd come as a thief in the night that's why it's good to wake up early in the morning because you never know when you'll be here how the dead will arrive it's a secret let me tell you one thing that all the secrets have been revealed by the seventh messenger they've been declared [Music] that'll give us Rapture in faith with the change with the body change Gomorrah and three men came an Earthly body [Music] why did your wife Sarah laugh the prophet says foreign is the discernment is to receive that promise the Lord Jesus Christ there's a question that was asked to the prophet will the bride be gathered in one place in the Rapture will it be in the East the prophet said yeah you don't have to be there the bride will be gathered in one place that's true but not until the resurrection foreign all of them have to be in a place like this maybe we don't understand everything but I believe it with all of my heart Now quickly if we go to First Corinthians chapter 2. verse 9. you love God Brothers truly we're very blessed Brothers First Corinthians [Music] it will pass that [Music] it's yours that place is just temporary Heaven's a nurse but my words will not pass First Corinthians chapter 2 verses but as is it as it is written I have not seen nor ear hurt s things that are there that we can't even imagine the things God has prepared for them I have not seen you have not heard to US foreign [Applause] blessed people in this day all the secrets have been revealed the musicians can come I'm going to read one last quote they're ready to go to Israel Jesus Christ foreign all of our loved ones and we get our body chains the Rapture will be ready to happen where does it say we'll find the Lord Jesus on the earth or in the sky tonight in the air foreign and then comes with her Allah because the Earth is not ready yet it has to be burned that's to receive the Holy Spirit the prophet says there's more than 200 000 demons and the ephrase ready to go against Israel but the bride she won't be here there's so many things that are going to happen but the bride won't be here that's why Joseph is brought her into the palace to not suffer what's going on take us to the palace and we don't even notice What's Happening Here I want you to pay much attention pay attention the prophet says like this the secret has been known the seals are open the trumpet sounded for the Israelites it's the message the Feast of the trumpets Pentecost age is finished the seventh trumpet is the age [Music] and this Moses the sound the seventh trumpet and make them known Christ what we know they will know about it that Jesus was crucified next slide [Music] and the seventh angel and foreign [Music] that takes away the sin of the world amen amen amen seventh message Hallelujah there he is in the message there's the message the second messenger hallelujah hallelujah [Music] [Applause] of God [Music] and we'll ask the bride I think just like Elise here is your Rebecca the seventh message when this Rapture happened by the Sea we'll say the Lamb of God takes the sin of the world and then the bride knows hallelujah hallelujah oh Jesus don't reject him time is ending the song leader can come forward [Music] time is ending you'll be your brother's
