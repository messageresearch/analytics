may you be the minister for your people this evening we ask the blessing of your your word in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen let's go to the Book of Esther uh chapter 2 we're going to read from verse 5 to 7 if you can say Amen when you have it now in suan the The Palace there was a certain Jew whose name was morai the son of jaier the son of shm and the son of k a benjamite who had been carried away from Jerusalem with a captivity which had been carried away with Janiah king of Judah whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of babyon had carried [Music] away and he brought up hadassa that is Esther his uncle's daughter for she had neither father nor mother and the maid was fair and beautiful whom morai when her father and mother were dead took for his own daughter may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated we also want to give thanks to the musicians before beginning I'd like to comment that once again Marcos and I have the same suit on this evening I want to speak about Esther from a little bit of a different way uh here talking about Esther about how she was an orphan and ever since she was a child if I could say it like that uh she had the trauma or the negative experience of losing both her mother and her father we know that death can cause a very strong impact in a person's life and the way that I want to take this and Esther was raised by a man whose name was Mori but it says that it was the son of his uncle the the daughter of his uncle so in other words they were cousins but Mori believed he was older than she was so he was like an uncle figure for her so then with Mori if you read the book of Esther he did a great job raising Esther but nonetheless she had the trauma of losing both mother and father we know that every human being without an exception of anybody everyone in their lives they go through a trauma or some abuse or some negative experience in life and the trauma of this young lady is that she lost her parents now typically when you're a child that's when you're growing your character is starting to form and once you're older it's harder to change the way that you are someone can receive trauma at any moment in their life but the moment where it can affect you and impact you for your whole life it's when you're young or when you're a child Satan hates the sons of God and that's why he attacks them Esther was a woman if you read the book of Esther because the queen was disobedient To The King The King cast her out of the Kingdom therefore he was searching for a new Queen so throughout the whole Kingdom he searched through all women to bring them to the Palace so they can be presented to the king and he could choose the one that he wanted we know that the king chose Esther and the Bible says that this King he loved Esther above all the women of the Kingdom now if you truly pay attention to the Book of Esther Esther was a woman that was a part of the Kingdom she had a very special position she was the queen but nonetheless she had her enemy in the same Kingdom that that enemy his name was hmon being that she was a Jew and Jews weren't really accepted in the Kingdom she had to change her name to a new name which was Esther before it was hadasa and then changed unto Esther and in searching the the the meaning of the name Esther one of the meanings is that it's a secret it's something hidden and it also means a star now we know that changing a bit before the foundation of the world there was a war in heaven between Satan and his name back then was Lucifer and it was against Michael brother Brown says in the message questions and answers Satan was the original Archangel of God he once dwelt in heaven he was once the greatest person in the heavens outside of God he was God's right-and man to Fellowship but he got puffed up in his heart Satan he had a complex he was almost like God though he had many wonderful qualities but he was not God therefore there was a complex that came from him that he went against God and against Michael what he did he went to Michael's Kingdom and he created his own kingdom there he tried to persuade that the Angels instead of worshiping God would worship him all of that was because of a complex he was almost like God but he was not and the the only one that was worshiped was God and he wanted worship sometimes a complex can cause you to have a jealousy towards someone and that Envy can carry you to hate that hate can make you attack the other person that's what happened with Satan it was just a complex he was almost like God but it was not him and hmon in the Kingdom of this King he was the right hand man of the king he was almost like the king he wanted to be worshiped like the king but he was not the king so you can see what happens in the story of Esther it's just a repetition or a continuation of what happened there in heaven in a single Kingdom there were two oppositions both wanted worship one by by right deserved it because he was King he was God and the other one who was the right hand and he had jealousy of what the other person had so he conspired against that Kingdom to receive that which he wanted and that's because of a complex that he was almost like God brother brandom says in the message the Seal of the Antichrist and forgive me that I don't have the quotes on the screen I didn't have the time to to do the the the screen or the slides but if you want the quotes I can give them to you gladly brother B says in the message the Seal of the Antichrist did you know that in heaven the devil was God's rightand man in the beginning that Lucifer the son of the morning was given power and the reason he brought sin into the world he was able to take something that God had created and pervert it back into an evil thing which back into an evil thing which started trouble in the beginning then God before the foundation of the world was ever laid when he seen what Satan done in his pride he went to the north and set up his kingdom fought against Michael and his angels do you see it lufer was the right-hand man of almighty God the son of the morning the first God granted him almost co-workers with him he was a coworker partially equal with him only Satan could not create God is the only Creator but God but Satan took something that God created and perverted it back to something else evil every person every person is born with certain pecul arities qualities by Nature a nature and mainly a person isn't conformed with that which they have they see a person that has something that they desire and a complex starts to come out of them that can produce an [Music] and can cause a negative reaction in the person you might you'd hate that person you hate yourself because of not having that thing and just simply it's a complex it's the same thing that happened to Satan it's the same thing that can happen to you a complex can cause so much destruction to you in your life it happened with the devil and it happened with hmon hmon wanted something that he didn't have in Isaiah 14 when it uh speaks of the devil verse 12 how art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did US weaken the Nations for thou has said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high it's something interesting Satan wanted to be as go like God and it was a complex that took him to his destruction caused him to be kicked out of heaven but when it's about us God wants us to be like him and Satan can see you can be like God that complex is born again that he had in the beginning and he's jealous of you that's why he hates you and he attacks you because you have something that he could never have you can be like God in the message the greatest battle ever fought brother BR says this great first battle that was ever fought begin in heaven when Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer and his angels it was first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on Earth it originated in heaven and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of Heaven to the Earth and it fell upon human beings then the battle from angels became human battles and Satan come to destroy God's creation what God had created for himself he Satan come to destroy this that was his purpose was to destroy it then the battle began here on Earth and began in us and has been raging ever since Satan is jealous of you there's something you've got that he cannot have that's why he hates you and he attacks you he wants to destroy you because he wanted to be like God he wanted to to be worshiped he wanted to be king and the Bible says that we were called to be Kings and Priests we share God's glory the glory that he could not have you've got it in your heart that's the Holy Spirit a complex if you've got a complex and you don't recognize you've got a complex it can destroy others and it can destroy you all of us everyone can have a complex I'm the first to admit I have many complexes but the key is to recognize what is the complex and not allow for my complex to control me there's times that my complexes they crash with God there's things that God asks of me he requires of me but because of my complex I have an imaginary barrier in front of me I can't get to that point because my complex doesn't allow it it is something imaginary it's the same thing that can happen to you you in your growth in your Christian Life you can be paralyzed because of a complex you can't Advance anymore because of something you've got that happened to you in the past and if the devil knows what your complex is if he's able to provoke it he can make you detain yourself not progress or go back to the way you used to be a complex can cause this the complex of the devil he wanted to be like God he wanted to be worshiped that same complex those same struggles they've gone on to the human race and hmon he had that complex remember Lucifer was the right hand man of God in heaven now in Esther 31 after these things did K did King aerus promote hmon the son of hamadaa and agagite and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes that were with him you can see that the king gave him a certain position that was Above the Rest but inferior to that of the king and Lucifer was God's right hand Superior to everyone else but inferior to God but because of this position that hmon had in verse two it says and all the king's servants that were in the king's gate bowed and reverenced hmon for the king had so commanded concerning him but morai bowed not nor did he reverence M Mori placed resistance against Hon's desire just like Michael and his angels They didn't accept what Lucifer wanted there in heaven it's a repetition of the same story it's not just the story of a king that married a woman that has this man hmon at his right hand it's something that began back there it happened with Esther and it happens to you today you are Esther you're a part of God's kingdom and you're going to have to confront hmon the devil in Esther 6 before reading it Mori if you read the book of Esther he would always be outside the gates of the palace in one occasion he saw he heard two men they were servants to the Palace I believe they were going to kill the king they were conspiring a plan to kill the king Mori then heard this and he warned Esther and Esther saved the king and so then from this event what happened it was registered in the in the the books of the king and now in Esther 61 on the night on that night could not the king's sleep and he commanded to bring the book of records ofon of The Chronicles and they were read before the king and it was found written that morai morai had told of ban and teresh two of the king's chamberlains the keepers of the door who sought to lay hand on the king aerus the king said what honor and dignity had be done to had been done to Mori for this then said the king's servants that ministered unto him there's nothing done for him and the King said who is in the court now hmon was come into an into the outward Court of the King's house to speak unto the king to hang morai on The Gallows that he had prepared for him while the king wanted to reward morai hmon tried to kill Mori verse five and the King's servant said unto him behold hmon standeth in the court and the King said let him come in so hmon came in and the King said unto him what shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor now hmon thought in his heart to whom the king Delight to honor more than to myself so hmon can see that the king wants to honor a man he thinks that the man is himself so then he says that in his it says that in his heart he thought this just like in Isaiah says that Lucifer thought in his heart verse seven and hmon answered the king for the man whom the king delighteth to honor let the Royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear and the horse that the king rideth upon and the Crown Royal which is set upon his head all these things were things that belonged to the king these were things that he wanted for himself then verse n says and let this appal and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes that they may array the man with all whom the king delighteth to honor and bring him on a horseback through the streets of the city and Proclaim before him thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighted to honor then the king said to hmon make haste and take the apparel and the horse as thou has said and do even so to Mori the Jew that sth at the king's gate let nothing fail of all that thou Hast spoken Hon's complex was Lucifer's complex he wanted to be like the greatest man he wanted everyone to worship Him and since he thought that honor was going to be for himself he said all the things that he wanted but it was not for hmon it was for Mori that complex once again arised in him he wanted to be like God but he couldn't receive it and he it was another person that received what he wanted if you're not careful the same thing can happen to you God to everyone has formed you in a certain way with certain things and without certain things and if you're not careful you can have jealousy towards someone else so therefore you'll hate that person or you'll hate yourself for not having that because it's a simple complex brother Brown says in the message questions and answers number four preached on the 30th of August of 1964 they ask him the question when a person realizes he has an inferior complex or some sort of complex how may he overcome this he said uh uh do the opposite if you're always waiting your way and that one little brat wants to always have everything your way turn right back around and give everything you've got in the other way if you're selfish and you want to hold everything then start giving away what you've got see do whatever just go the vice versa that's the way to overcome anything it's an antidote so then what happened to Satan it was a complex he saw something that he wanted and he wanted to get it for himself he didn't want it and someone else received it the same thing can happen to anybody and it can be a simple complex everyone I dare to say everyone if not the majority we've got complexes and the majority of complexes can originate from something of your childhood when I was born I was born a certain day a certain month and I was born a certain way by Nature I'm an introvert I don't like people to look at me I don't like to be photographed I don't like people to record me I don't know why until one day I spoke to my mother and she told me that my grandfather was just the same oh my my grandmother I don't like people to give me a lot of attention but nonetheless God called me to minister to interpret I don't like it and because of that I I put a lot of resistance toward God every person has their own complex once one day I took a course of uh medical interpreting and the teacher she said there's two types of people interpr there's interpreters that are extroverts that they like to talk to everybody they can talk all day long and then there's interpreters or translators that those they are introverts they'd rather be alone in front of a computer with the dictionary and studying words in that moment I noticed that I'm a translator but God called me to be an interpreter I've got to use my voice but my complex placed resistance on God because I don't like people to look at me I don't like for cameras to be recording me I I I think that I look bad I said something incorrect it's a complex that God had to help me to overcome your complexes they can impede you to serve God God can call you for a certain thing but because you've got a you put these B imaginary borders you say I can't do that Moses did the same thing go to Egypt and deliver my people well I can't do it I stutter complexes can impede you from serving God and grow in your Christian life I've myself I've caused my own self harm there's no person that's harmed me more than myself the person that I struggle with the most the person that displeases me the most is myself because I recognize the complexes that I carry and I don't want to overcome my complexes they're very Comfort comfortable they protect me from the humiliation that people can criticize me people can make fun of me a complex can make a person distance themselves from everyone and and hide somewhere to be free from criticism and humiliation of other people a complex can cause this and I've got that complex when I was a little boy I thought well I was just a normal child but once I got to school I noticed I wasn't a normal kid at school ever since I was a young boy and even in Sunday school people would make fun of me people would always say I'm so quiet they'd say oh Emanuel just shut up you make so much noise others would say you need to speak up once a brother he doesn't know that this affected me in a negative way but I allowed it to affect me in a negative way my my face also doesn't help me because it looks like I'm angry or so [Music] serious once I'm walking getting close to a brother and he points to the ground and I looked to see if something was on the ground and he said oh your smile fell on the ground and to not offend the brother and I just faked my smile but honestly that offended me and it bothered me so much that he said that but it wasn't his fault but it was my fault I allowed that complex to to dominate me but I recognized it so I forgave him but if I had not forgiven him that complex would have taken me to hatred towards that person that's one of the most loving people I know but a complex can destroy you can destroy yourself if you allow it uh some months ago I went to visit another church and at that church a friend of mine preached so after service was over I went with my friend and all the everyone came to go talk to him they really enjoyed what he preached and since I'm an introvert it's my nature I was just standing there listening to everybody else they had the desire to go and talk to him and with much pleasure I was just quietly listening but since I've got such a serious face a brother came and he started talking talking talking at the end he he's saying yes brother he was telling my friend the only thing I don't understand why do they have a security guard standing here and he was talking about me and it took me a second to catch what he was talking about I've got a serious face I'm all [Music] quiet I said no I'm just listening and I'm just enjoying what you guys are talking about then we went to a restaurant to go eat and it so happened that I had to sit next to that same brother and that brother I had him right here on my side and he's such a talkative person but I'm not and he's over talking and talking and talking and once again mentions how I'm so quiet he keeps talking talking talking until finally he touches my arm and he starts poking like as if they were buttons I'm just looking for the volume button on this young man and it seems so insignificant that shouldn't affect me but what he did it provoked a complex that I had in my childhood to to to arise in me I felt uncomfortable I felt bad that I made him feel bad because I'm not interesting enough for him I can't start a conversation so then what I did I went to the restroom I stayed there for about five minutes until I gained my composure and then I decided to leave I dismissed myself from the brothers and then I left and those days were just horrible days for me why because of a complex of my childhood I didn't understand what happened to me for me it was something just so insignificant the reaction that I had it was like that of a child I shouldn't have even done that but it affected me the following day honestly I didn't even want to study but I wanted to listen to something so then I pushed play on this life story of brother brandom and brother Bram was talking about his own childhood when he was a child uh his father used to uh make alcohol and on one occasion his father was with a friend and then he's there with brother brandham he's about eight or nine years old and the that friend brings out a bottle of alcohol he gives it to the father and is also and also offers it to brother brandom but years before that Whirlwind in the in the tree had told Brother brandom don't smoke Don't drink don't defile your body in any way but in offering him that drink he said no but the friend the friend and his father they made fun of brother brandham and they called him a and since he didn't want to be a he was going to take that drink at that moment he started to hear that Whirlwind again that wind so instead of taking a drink he just left crying years later uh he's at an appointment with a a friend and two young ladies they went out to eat then one of the young ladies that that he really liked she started to smoke and offered the cigarette to brother Brandon he said no she said you don't smoke you don't drink you don't dance you don't go to parties then what do you do I really like hunting and I like going fishing and once again she called him a and because he didn't want to be a he was going to smoke that cigarette but once again he heard the Whirlwind he he dropped the cigarette he left running brother Bram says those friends followed him making fun of him calling him a he went out to the field just to go cry what happened to him a complex of his past a complex can take you to commit sin can take you to go destroy yourself destroy your own life it can make you devalue your own self make you to hate somebody else can make you isolate yourself from everyone else go and hide from everyone else because you don't got something that they do have you don't do something that they do a complex can do that so then hearing this I could understand what happened to me the day before it seems like something so insignificant that I really shouldn't pay any attention to that but my complex is different than yours there's different ways that the devil can provoke me like he can provoke you so Esther had a trauma in her past she didn't allow for her trauma affect her but hmon he had a complex that complex took him to his own death it all depends if you allow your complexes to dominate you you're Esther you're born in God's kingdom you're the the the wife of the king but even so you still have to confront amen brother Bram he also had his complexes at growing up in the message standing in the Gap God bless God bless each one of you we hope to see you again real soon till then will you do this one favor for me now both here and on the tapes also you Brethren pray that God Place into my heart something that I lost out there in that complex it's so easy to build a complex brother bram's complex we believe he's the messenger of this age the God's Prophet Elijah the prophet we believe that with all of our heart but back then in the times of brother brandham when he was giving his message the complex that he had is that people didn't want to listen to him people didn't want to pay attention so then if you listen to this message standing in the Gap brother bram's plan since he really enjoyed ened hunting and he enjoyed living in the mountains his plan was he's going to go and get in the mountain take his wife with him and live over there separated from everyone else why because people just didn't want to hear him if people don't want to hear me that's fine I'll go but since I'm a prophet if he gives me a message I'll come down and I'll preach to them then I'll go back up there people don't want to hear me that's fine a complex makes you build walls against other people that just want to help you makes you not be able to advance more with God if you hear that that message or or have heard the message you'll hear that brother brandham had a vision of two bums and in real life he encountered two bums and I believe his son Billy Paul said look dad that looks like you and your brother-in-law it was at that moment God then told him if you continue with your plans you'll end up like that and your wife's going to leave you why did that happen because of a complex that of being rejected an introverted person a person that's rejected since they don't get along well with people or people don't accept them they'd rather just be alone and being alone you're in your weakest point with the devil I know it because it's happened to me something happens to me I make a mistake I think God doesn't love me anymore he won't accept me again I did it I crossed the line then there's no reason for me to go to him and ask for forgiveness and because I accept that I go days weeks and months without talking to him because of a complex I feel that as though I'm just not worthy and this time I just cross the line when the Bible says God with his great love in which he loved us has forgiven us even with my complexes my mistakes the person that showed me the most love is is God but then my complexes they they build walls with him and the person that hurts me the most it's myself because of a simple complex your complexes can paralyze you can weak weak in you can make you lose all the progress that you've made can make you separate from everyone else and believe that everybody hates you nobody loves you nobody misses you a complex can do that because you don't feel Worthy you know nobody likes you that's my complex that I receiv received since a child since I was so quiet I thought I'm never going to have friends now every time that I travel I encounter a friend and say how do I get friends when I'm so quiet God helps you with your complexes if you see that someone has a complex that they're not too social or they don't feel that they're worthy whatever reason the best medicine the best an adult for that complex it's love but what you've got to do is compare your complex to the word of God that's what brother brandham says if you've got a complex compare to the word of God to see if it's true or not so then Esther she received a trauma in her childhood she lost her parents when they died heon he wanted to kill the Jews kill Mori he didn't know but he was conspiring against his own Queen and Esther found out so what she did she began to pray for three days the Bible says now the King was in uh what's called the inner courts and the Bible says there was a law if anyone entered into those inner cour without being summoned they'd be killed except that the king would extend his scepter which was a golden staff that he carried the Bible says that when it speaks of Esther the king loved her above all the women of the Kingdom so when she had that petition she started to pray if you notice she started to fulfill the office of a priest interceding for someone else having compassion for her people she started to pray and then she clothed herself a certain way the priest had to dress a certain way entered into the inner Court went into the holiest of hly where the King's throne was with the risk of being killed but since the king loved her so much he forgave he pardoned her life you're not worthy to enter into the holiest of Hol but the blood that he shed it makes makes you worthy and it forgives your life pardons your life even apart from your complexes and your sins your mistakes don't allow your complex impede you to come to God your complexes make you be selfish that you just want to search for your own benefit the one that searches for your benefit is God the Bible says don't forget about his Mercy don't forget about all of his benefits it says the love does so many things one thing it doesn't do it doesn't search for its own good and a person full of complexes just wants to protect themselves they don't want to go through more humiliations more criticism you weren't called to be selfish I wasn't called to be self and because of my complex I've been very arrogant a complex can cause that you can be selfish and not help the rest because you're thinking of how can I overcome you want to protect yourself no one harm me when Christ gave his life he shed his blood he was humbled in the worst way because he wanted to save me Christ will never care about the complexes the mistakes the sins that you've got but if you allow those complexes to over to dominate you they're going to impede you in your Christian walk the key is recognize your complex and allow God to give you his love the person that has loved me the most that's loved me the most That Forgives me over and over and over he's never against me it's God but I've got to recognize that I harm myself in recognizing my complex Hebrews 4:4 seeing then that we have a great high priest that has passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to to help in time of need there's a a a scepter that's going to find you if you draw close to God there's not a need to have fear the Bible says that perfect love casts out fear there's a king that loves you and will give you of his own divine nature his own Holiness and will give you what Satan could never have to be like God perfect let us stand brother brandom says in the message Fellowship preached on the 11th of June in 1960 and men just educate themselves till they'll educate themselves away from one another they get complexes you don't get complexes by the blood of Jesus Christ re you get love that's where you get love not a complex that I'm just a little bigger than somebody else a little better than somebody else I know a little more than somebody else you've got your arms around everybody and it's a basis of Love through the blood the blood cleanses let us pray Heavenly [Music] Father I remember brother Brandon when he had that Vision when he was criticizing that elderly woman for being in that sinful condition and then you gave saw gave him a vision of the high priest how he had wounds on his ribs and he put his hands in his fingers in those ribs and would write with his own blood Willam BR William brandham has been forgiven help me Lord help everyone I know I'm not
