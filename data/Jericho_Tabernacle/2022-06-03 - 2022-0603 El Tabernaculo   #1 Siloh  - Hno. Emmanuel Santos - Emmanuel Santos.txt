standing we can please bow our heads we just as we are like to go to the book of genesis the 49th chapter verse 10. you can say amen once you have it the word says this scripture shall not depart from judah nor a law giver from between his feet until shiloh come and unto him shall the gathering of all the people i want you to notice in genesis you know the book in genesis persona as a person i want to go to joshua 18. verse 1. the whole congregation of the children of israel assembled together as shiloh and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there and the land was subdued before them genesis speaks of shiloh una persona as a person but in joshua the bible speaks of shiloh come on lugar as a placebo you're going to find a lot of contradictions in the world but when one receives the revelation of the word el cuadra that all of the old testament is sombra is type in shadow of the history of jesus christ so this is my my title for this evening to speak of the tabernacle and speak of shiloh different descriptions in the early days when they will come up to shiloh for the blessings of the lord and now tonight we have assembled here to hear your word it's a place where the people were gathered by the ram will also say it's a place where they will assemble or gather together the message god's wrapped gift it was [Music] heavenly peace tranquility in palestine a place in palestine like i said genesis 49 that all the people will be gathered there in shiloh will be gathered unto him therefore the bible makes no mistake no comment contradictions doesn't make any contradictions but there's going to be something that's going to connect both of them the same thing with these scriptures there's a reason why god says that here it's a person and over it has different names in english in english vernaculo de la congregacion it's called the tabernacle of the congregation and the tabernacle of the witness espanol but in spanish it's the tabernacle of assembling together and the tabernacle of the testimony i want to speak on what the tabernacle of the assembling together because god says two or three gathered in my name there i would be idiots god told moses we all amongst us as we suddenly look to the word of the living god and speaking on the subject of dedicating of the building i would like to make this statement that is known among if god is omnipresent just like the atmosphere then he is a myth but god is a person therefore the reason why he's everywhere because he knows that everything that's going on and if god was to be in every place and sin will not be able to exist because god cannot live or dwell with our sin but god himself dwells in a certain place god told moses and that building was placed in shiloh now is [Music] there and it's also a place and ii samuel 7 6 speaking concerning the tabernacle now whereas i have not dwelled in any house since the time that i brought up the children of israel out of egypt even to this day una casa a house something stable something that would not be moved to place to place so i have not dwelt in any can walk in that place but when you see the building you only see things you don't see a towards another tabernacle since the day that i brought up to israel to this day but i've gone from 10 to 10 and from one tabernacle to another aura it's a person it's a place and it's a place of gathering together fuel guardios whether god placed a tabernacle there in that place first samuel in chapter four algo paso and silo something happened there in shiloh album something very serious if you read the first three chapters of first samuel habla talks about the priests of uh the sons of eli the priest eli samuel 4 3 says los angeles and when the people were coming to the camp the elders of israel said wherefore hath the lord spent us today before the philistines let us fetch the ark of covenant of the lord unto shalom unto us that when it cometh among us it may save us out of the hand of our enemies so the people sent to shiloh that they might bring from hence the ark of the covenant of the lord of hosts which dwelleth between the cherubians and the sons of eli hofney and vanessa's were there with the ark of the covenant of god and when the ark of the covenant of the lord came into the camp all over israel shouted with great shouts so that the earth rang again and when the philistines heard the noise of the shout they said what meaneth the noise of this great shout on the camp of the hebrews and they understood that the ark of the lord was come into the camp behind that thing verse 10. and the philistines fought in israel and israel was smitten and they fled every man into his tent and there was very a great slaughter for their fellow israel thirty thousand foot men and the ark of god was taken the sons of ilahafny and finas were slain now if you study of eli and because of that the ark was taken it was stolen now if you sin in gran manera in great for they provoked him to anger with their high places and moved him to jealousy with their graven images when god heard this he was wroth and greatly upheld israel so that he forsook the tabernacle of shiloh the tenth which he placed among men the reason why god left shiloh recorded a persona remember a person where the people will gather with to him with him onsen verse 11. is this the house which is called by my name become a den of robbers in your eyes doesn't that remind you of another scripture when jesus entered the temple where god is living in escueva de la drones esta casa s become a den of robbers which is called by my name behold i've even seen it saith the lord andada ora ami lugarencilo but going out to my place which was in shiloh al principio where i set my name at the first so god placed his name in silo in shiloh pueblo ira and see what i did to do it for the wickedness of the people of israel my people of israel is a persona shallow as a person the wickedness of the sins of the people and now because you have done all these work saith the lord and i spake unto you rising up early and speaking but you hear he heard not and i called you but he answered yes therefore what i do onto this house which is called by my name wherein ye trust and on to the place which i gave to you and unto the fathers i said back done to shiloh to worship in the temple jeremiah 26 6. then will i make this house like shiloh yes de la tierra it will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth so there being a place of blessing it became a blessing a cursed place all because of the the sins of the people for the youth is difficult in this world there's so many attractions that are out in the world but i know that also in your heart you don't want to do those things and that's why you have to come to christ and coming to christ you're humbling yourself before him because you're recognizing it that he's the only one that can help you with your problem in your path it was a great place a blessing of worship of gathering together it is types and shadows of better things of of to come there was another tabernacle that was to come but this tabernacle was not a building that's why he speaks that he spoke he put his name in the tabernacle but the name of the lord is the lord jesus christ it's a place it's notice how he interprets the scriptures now the gathering will be on to the lord commodity as jacob said in el capito in the 49th chapter as he go until from between the feet hasta que vegas until shalom come lando de judah speaking of judah and to him shall be the gathering bee so the gathering jeffersonville whether i am in jeffersonville or in suissa whether i'm in sweden whether i or whatever it is to meet the lord in the air people will come from all parts of the earth that's dead and so forth will rise i will gather all all the people on to me chris shiloh speaks of christ it's a persona it is a person yes also a place that's where moses made a tabernacle it's jesus christ in paragraph 144 he continues saying universal his coming will be universal it would not be just coming to louisville and the resurrection and the gathering shall be from everywhere restriction what is speaking of shiloh as a resurrection joshua jordan when he crossed jordan one thing to one person to one place christ shiloh is christ tiempo de jesus now shiloh has in his importance during the time of jesus expectancy brother brahms says speaking concerning of mary estaba and her wrote up she engaged to a man who had been married before they had four sons you truth came through jesus christ the parents are deciding what's going to be the name of that child jesus and before jesus was born was going to be his name and he sent a message to mary this is i found something that was very interesting jesus we see that jesus before he came in he had a messenger that came before him which is john the baptist now if you notice malachi 3. speaking that jesus said to john coming behold i will send my messenger el cual prepara el camino de lante de me and he shall prepare the way before me even and the lord whom he seeks shall certainly come to this temp to his temple even the messenger of the covenant whom you delight and behold he shall come saith the lord of hosts that was john announcing the coming of jesus you never really practiced the office of a high priest in the temple in the temple since it was a child he went to the desert but here speaks on malachi 3-1 speaks of the messenger viniendo al temple coming to the temple temple what was the temple that he came to do at paragraph 233 this is jesus that was john announcing the coming of jesus temple and he came to the temple in exactly what he said the message of the covenant the angel in the wilderness with his disciples do you believe he was that messenger but in a person when the bible speaks to this person it speaks of this person like it was a place that's why it's a place remember his tabernacle jesus that god did the same thing with jesus instead of being a place of blessings 224 his own self-prayer since in his own body on the tree para que nosotros estano muertos alos pecados that we being that descent should be left righteous by whose stripes ye or he were healed now when it speaks of shiloh it's a persona it is a person and it's a place vernacular where the tabernacle is at home that has the name of god [Music] and all that was the cause of the sins of the people that didn't christ became because of our curse because of us again on verse 24. this is i like how it says in english it says on the tree and deuteronomy 21 22 this is and if a man have committed a sin worthy of death and he be he to be put to death and to hang him on a tree no deja esque his body should not remain all night upon the tree sinfalta el mismo wise bury him in that day porque maldito por dios es el colgado for he that is hang is a curse of god e and that's what they did with jesus christ he was hanging on a tree and he didn't remain there all night but quickly they took him off the cross and they went to go bury him for me it was my sin and it was your sins it could turn christ accursed just like shiloh place because of the sins of the people it became a cursed place christ did all of that for you me and for me notice in first peter 2 25. shepherd and the bishop of your souls returning back again speaking of shiloh uh now is a place of gathering will be for the gathering of the lord como dicco jacob and el capitolo nueva like it says jacob and the 49th chapter it says like this pueblos and the gathering will be on to him there will be no love or go away until from between the feet until shiloh come avilando de judah speaking of judah yeah in jeffersonville whether i'm in jeffersonville or in suica or whether i'm in sweden ocillo whether with the shepherd one last quote it is the rising of the sun the spirit left him in the garden of gethsemane the literal tabernacle the building for the cause of the sins of the people it was during seminary jesus began to receive the lord of the sins for suspicion because of your sins and my sins he had to die like a man remember friends he didn't have to do that that was god anointed that flesh which was human flesh and if if he didn't if he if he went up then it went up there as god nunca so when god looked down on the body of christ he saw both male and female fue tododo redemido it was all redeemed in that one body uno you see they're one lomismo same la palabra same word la misma palabra habla del novion the same word spoke of the groom that means it speaks of the bride so then your your curse now is in christ now he paid the price to take away that curse now all of that chastisement del pecado and he said he was going to gather everyone all right for the temple to receive the chastisement the nos tropical our beloved brothers have gone with the lord that's what the bible teaches us and these small things even concerning shiloh yes resuscitation amen amen you will be in shiloh and you will be there with christ they're dwelling with christ they're worshiping him amen celestial heavenly father we give you thanks tonight lord foreign for the small message i pray lord that people might have understood and understood understand what happened to shiloh is something that happened to you that was for my sins and their sins why you receive the curse help us lord and when the rapture comes it will be gathered together with you name of jesus
