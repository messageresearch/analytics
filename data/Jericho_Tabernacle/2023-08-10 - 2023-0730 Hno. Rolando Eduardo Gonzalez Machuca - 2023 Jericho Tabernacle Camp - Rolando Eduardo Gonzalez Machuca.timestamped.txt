[57:45] I believe I was remembering
[57:51] in one of the services that brother pray
[57:54] so that is so here we have our answer
[57:57] [Applause]
[58:04] now we're going to have to pray to the
[58:07] Lord
[58:08] so he can make the water be a bit more
[58:11] calm
[58:13] and then we can take our picture
[58:15] afterwards amen
[58:19] so we're happy to have you here Brothers
[58:24] the brothers are doing everything that's
[58:26] possible
[58:31] so we can be comfortable here in the
[58:33] sanctuary praising the Lord
[58:37] so don't let the devil distract you this
[58:40] place is
[58:42] after these beautiful services that
[58:44] we've had
[58:45] the water is the least important thing
[58:48] you're going to get wet
[58:50] but you also dry up afterwards
[58:55] we want to welcome you
[58:57] to everyone
[59:02] 2023. to our 2023 Jericho Tabernacle
[59:06] Family Camp
[59:08] have you had a good time so far
[59:12] I guess
[59:14] we have to express it and say Lord thank
[59:17] you
[59:23] brothers that are making this Camp
[59:25] possible
[59:27] so for them to renew their strength so
[59:30] we can have another ID 24.
[59:38] if not I'll raise my voice
[59:45] and as you know
[59:48] the theme of our camp
[59:52] is
[59:54] a Prayer Changes Things
[59:57] and I believe
[1:00:00] it's been a living proof
[1:00:03] in our hearts
[1:00:05] in our life is
[1:00:09] and the testimony of our brothers
[1:00:12] it confirms that
[1:00:22] for the experiences that we've had
[1:00:30] and as you know the base scripture is
[1:00:32] James 5 16.
[1:00:34] okay this is
[1:00:39] one to another
[1:00:43] and pray one for another
[1:00:46] he may be healed
[1:00:52] prayer of a righteousness

[1:33:29] is
[1:33:35] the prayer is the title is Prayer

[1:33:48] that the the prayer of the righteousness
[1:33:52] an effectual fervent prayer availeth
[1:33:55] much
[1:33:56] and that is true
[1:33:59] how many can say Amen
[1:34:04] presentations
[1:34:06] we've had Friday and Saturday wonderful
[1:34:09] presentations of the world
[1:34:12] where I believe paying attention to what
[1:34:14] we were told
[1:34:17] we can take so much things
[1:34:20] so much tools
[1:34:22] that can help us
[1:34:37] against the one that's opposing the word
[1:34:41] of God
[1:34:43] we know that there's two kingdoms
[1:34:46] kingdom of darkness
[1:34:49] they'll always be opposite
[1:34:52] and in contention
[1:34:55] may God help us
[1:34:59] the prayer the factual prayer of the
[1:35:02] righteous
[1:35:04] that took me to the thought
[1:35:06] to the subtitle
[1:35:09] Primera first the kingdom of God and his
[1:35:15] righteousness
[1:35:17] and everything will come
[1:35:20] um
[1:35:24] brother Branham tells us
[1:35:29] the prayer is a strong weapon God's
[1:35:31] given us
[1:35:34] I read in a message a
[1:35:39] poderos he says that it's something
[1:35:41] powerful yes but it's so powerful okay
[1:36:13] let's go to Isaiah 38.
[1:36:16] okay
[1:36:37] Isaiah 38 we were saying okay
[1:36:44] in those days Hezekiah got sick unto
[1:36:46] death
[1:36:50] and Isaiah the prophet came
[1:36:53] son of Gamers and came unto him
[1:36:56] said to him the Lord says
[1:37:05] the word of a prophet the mouthpiece of
[1:37:09] God it cannot fail
[1:37:36] and with a perfect heart
[1:37:53] now you're following Brothers
[1:37:56] it wasn't just any prayers
[1:38:00] and he was saying unto who everyone knew
[1:38:03] you know
[1:38:06] I've walked before this
[1:38:10] and with the perfect heart
[1:38:14] and then he started weeping in tears
[1:38:17] within his heart
[1:38:18] brother Brandon tells us
[1:38:27] he started to walk
[1:38:30] when the Lord told him hold on
[1:38:33] my mind
[1:38:35] go back
[1:38:38] a prophet is very obedient
[1:38:40] God bless us
[1:38:45] then came the word of the Lord to Isaiah
[1:38:47] saying verse 4.
[1:38:51] go and say to Hezekiah
[1:38:53] in other words turn around correct
[1:38:57] don't say it to the Lord thy father
[1:39:04] I have heard thy prayer
[1:39:06] and I've seen thy tears
[1:39:11] I will add unto thy name
[1:39:14] 15 years
[1:39:21] how many would like to pray like that
[1:39:25] and we can
[1:39:27] yeah
[1:39:36] I'm not lying
[1:39:38] me you know me
[1:39:42] is
[1:39:44] and he made it the opinion change
[1:39:50] there was a program of God
[1:39:56] it was his time
[1:40:00] and I'd like to point out something
[1:40:07] it was the petition of Hezekiah
[1:40:11] in a permissive will not
[1:40:14] in perfect will okay
[1:40:31] with everything
[1:40:35] God heard the prayer
[1:40:38] and gave it 15 more years
[1:40:43] I know that more things happen that God
[1:40:46] answered for him
[1:40:49] another thing that I see is that he did
[1:40:53] right
[1:41:16] the hard drives don't get hot that way
[1:41:20] we've been told
[1:41:23] the first thing is
[1:41:37] so that our Focus can change
[1:41:40] how many like that
[1:41:44] our self-righteousness
[1:41:46] in those days
[1:41:51] we've been given something more not
[1:41:55] self-righteousness
[1:42:01] with God
[1:42:04] who could come
[1:42:06] before
[1:42:11] I've been here I've been straight
[1:42:14] foreign
[1:42:17] I couldn't do that
[1:42:27] that's perfect
[1:42:30] that prayer
[1:42:32] it'll reach the Throne of God
[1:42:34] God bless us
[1:42:37] yeah
[1:42:38] both yeah are we going okay
[1:42:42] this is sometimes
[1:43:21] now that's tremendous
[1:43:40] you don't have anything to worry about
[1:43:45] everything was under control
[1:43:48] in the Garden of Eden do you remember
[1:43:52] in the evening time
[1:43:55] he'd go in his father's arms and he
[1:43:59] talked to him face to face
[1:44:02] and he would Embrace him oh
[1:44:05] I'm so happy myself
[1:44:08] oh when we walk in Eden how many will be
[1:44:12] there
[1:44:13] self-righteousness no no foreign by the
[1:44:18] blood of the Lamb
[1:44:24] that blood has power Brothers
[1:44:27] what I'm trying to say
[1:44:31] that a moment came
[1:44:34] that something appeared and you know it
[1:44:40] and it changed the whole scene
[1:44:46] brother speaks about
[1:44:49] that when man fell
[1:44:54] our fathers in Eden are
[1:44:57] a
[1:44:59] Los Angeles the angels
[1:45:02] He paints a picture
[1:45:04] this is all like a drama
[1:45:07] God's waiting
[1:45:10] that the Fallen race of Adam
[1:45:12] sin opened its eyes
[1:45:15] look unto
[1:45:18] calvaryto that the veil was open so that
[1:45:22] now our prayers
[1:45:28] anything that we ask of the Lord
[1:45:30] it can reach his presence
[1:45:45] don't get tired
[1:45:47] just hold on it's yours
[1:45:51] it's your inheritance
[1:46:01] the prophet says he becomes unconscious
[1:46:03] of who he is
[1:46:14] can you think about that
[1:46:17] that that son he had control
[1:46:22] there was peace
[1:46:24] and if the wind would blows
[1:46:27] that first Adam would say Be Peace at
[1:46:30] peace
[1:46:32] how many prayers for the storm to stop I
[1:46:35] prayed for it right there
[1:46:37] so then
[1:46:39] we're on the right path we're on the way
[1:46:41] back
[1:46:42] we're on that promise restoration
[1:46:48] is it not so yeah
[1:46:59] in a faith
[1:47:03] to get to a perfect faith
[1:47:05] necesitamos we need Primera first of all
[1:47:09] the kingdom of God and his righteousness
[1:47:14] and that righteous God
[1:47:27] it's unchangeable
[1:47:31] things went into judgment
[1:47:34] and there was a condemnation
[1:47:39] I'm going back in the tape going way far
[1:47:42] back
[1:47:45] I know but I believe because you've been
[1:47:48] taught
[1:47:49] we've got to know where we come from
[1:47:51] where we're standing so no word is that
[1:47:55] we're going to bendiga God bless us
[1:47:58] Anton says
[1:48:01] ah
[1:48:03] um when that happens
[1:48:08] brother Brandon quotes the message as a
[1:48:10] foundation of Faith
[1:48:12] the man becomes unconscious it seems
[1:48:15] like he doesn't understand
[1:48:18] who he is
[1:48:23] what is Man David said in the Psalms
[1:48:26] he's the greatest of God's creations
[1:48:45] um
[1:49:06] that's a great thing for God to be loved
[1:49:11] but God is also righteousness
[1:49:15] that's a little stronger
[1:49:18] but if you look in the scriptures
[1:49:24] if love appears a hundred times
[1:49:28] righteousness appears 200. go and test
[1:49:32] it out it's easy
[1:49:36] just test it and introduce
[1:49:40] and then go search the word
[1:49:41] righteousness
[1:49:43] you'll find out that it's double that is
[1:49:46] scripture my scripture yes and apart
[1:49:50] from that many times
[1:49:55] in that condition
[1:49:58] solamente intellectual strictly
[1:50:00] intellectual
[1:50:01] sometimes emotional security they want
[1:50:04] to get off this off the road
[1:50:06] from that thought that God is
[1:50:09] righteousness see yes yes
[1:50:21] there's a prayer that the Lord said and
[1:50:26] don't do it like that is
[1:50:36] that love and make these things in front
[1:50:38] of the synagogue and etc etc
[1:50:42] don't be like the Gentiles
[1:50:45] that they think because of what they do
[1:50:47] they'll fleas
[1:50:50] there's a prayer that that one's not he
[1:50:53] said it yeah
[1:51:17] you'll be rewarded openly that's a good
[1:51:20] prayer
[1:51:42] the Lord presents to us
[1:51:47] forgive me where I jump around
[1:51:50] and he says
[1:51:52] look at the grass
[1:51:54] they've got all that they need and do
[1:51:58] you see them praying it's a good
[1:52:00] question
[1:52:01] do you see nature praying
[1:52:04] she's connected to God she continues
[1:52:07] with God
[1:52:09] is that good
[1:52:11] this is our hearts
[1:52:15] it should always circulate with God
[1:52:19] God bless us
[1:52:22] that's why the Lord told us
[1:52:28] the kingdom of God and his righteousness
[1:52:35] what are we searching what do we need
[1:52:38] what is
[1:52:40] where do we want to reach
[1:52:50] and his righteous
[1:52:54] Ness
[1:52:55] and the kingdom of God the Lord said
[1:52:58] the Pharisees would ask him

[2:02:44] and say how it's what it's made up of
[2:02:47] but with that to fabricate
[2:02:50] an atomic bomb is that right
[2:02:56] this matter right here atomos Adams
[2:03:02] the wood from the Tree Adams
[2:03:07] I think this is imitation but forgive me
[2:03:11] yeah I'm sorry
[2:03:16] but that one that's the original win
[2:03:19] that's the good one that's the one that
[2:03:21] works
[2:03:24] but it was needed
[2:03:27] Atomic power
[2:03:29] to create it what did it the word of God
[2:03:35] his whole world
[2:03:42] famous came to existence
[2:03:50] he made it for creation precious
[2:04:00] it has to change
[2:04:04] now
[2:04:09] we can split the atom fabric May create
[2:04:12] the bomb
[2:04:14] we can explain
[2:04:16] all those things
[2:04:20] on a leaf
[2:04:26] how it is that grass is there
[2:04:30] God and simplicity
[2:04:32] it's manifested sincere simple parakeets
[2:04:51] but you revealed it unto babes
[2:04:56] um
[2:05:00] and you know when the scripture speaks
[2:05:04] he's talking about the children he's
[2:05:07] talking about you he's talking about me
[2:05:10] the simple children of God
[2:05:13] not the great intellectuals
[2:05:16] not the great scientist see yes
[2:05:21] we appreciate appreciate all the
[2:05:23] technology it works but one day
[2:05:27] this won't work
[2:05:31] but you revealed it unto babes
[2:06:09] with God's favor
[2:06:16] why are you talking to us about this
[2:06:19] Maybe
[2:06:24] I know a little bit
[2:06:27] in construction
[2:06:29] about building
[2:06:31] there's nothing
[2:06:33] within building more valuable than the
[2:06:37] foundation
[2:06:57] from that excavation
[2:07:00] if they knew because
[2:07:03] they're laying the foundation
[2:07:06] and there is
[2:07:15] we know the pyramid
[2:07:17] what is the foundation
[2:07:21] but before Faith
[2:07:23] the new birth
[2:07:26] New Birth
[2:07:29] what good is
[2:07:31] if it doesn't have a foundation
[2:07:46] and his righteousness
[2:07:50] that which is born of flesh is Spirit
[2:08:02] what shall I pray
[2:08:05] but will I pray in the spirit and with
[2:08:08] understanding
[2:08:16] into that effectual fervent prayer
[2:08:20] in the songs that can be received
[2:08:28] are we okay
[2:08:32] not too many amends
[2:08:36] let's drink some water instead
[2:08:43] they don't
[2:08:45] understand
[2:08:47] but when we have a good foundation
[2:08:52] then we can add and then comes faith
[2:08:56] and it's not my faith you know it we
[2:09:01] need the face that was in Jesus Christ
[2:09:14] Jesus Christ
[2:09:19] that's why the word
[2:09:21] it's circulated with him and he with the
[2:09:25] word amen
[2:10:07] [Applause]
[2:10:08] he'll have respect
[2:10:13] but first things first
[2:10:16] God help us
[2:10:22] it's not difficult
[2:10:25] it's not complicated
[2:10:28] the messenger already said it
[2:10:31] is
[2:10:32] the Lord made it easy
[2:10:35] he did it for us
[2:10:40] he took
[2:11:02] can you say Amen to that
[2:11:06] without faith
[2:11:18] we understand that baseball baseball
[2:11:21] we understand
[2:11:24] we won't even impossible
[2:11:29] impossible
[2:11:32] everything is possible
[2:11:41] oh now the building's starting to get
[2:11:43] higher
[2:11:46] it'll reach
[2:11:47] a point of one day being finished oh yes
[2:11:52] they're waiting right bro they're
[2:11:55] waiting
[2:11:56] they cannot be perfected without us
[2:12:00] God bless us
[2:12:07] if I told you that for me it was today
[2:12:09] was going to be memorable
[2:12:13] I believe that at the end of the message
[2:12:15] for many of you will also
[2:12:21] Sita but we need
[2:12:26] to be local to be placed
[2:12:29] upon a solid foundation
[2:12:32] see yes but also we know that's why this
[2:12:35] came un Constructor a builder
[2:12:39] Savi knows
[2:12:43] that is viral Pablo losupo Paul knew it
[2:12:49] just like a Chief Architect
[2:12:51] he laid the foundation man amen
[2:12:57] and the prophets
[2:13:00] those that are coming further
[2:13:03] they see how they're building see right
[2:13:07] now speaking about Builders
[2:13:11] we've got quite a large amount of Youth
[2:13:18] God bless you
[2:13:22] place your building
[2:13:25] upon the rock
[2:13:29] as a good Builder
[2:13:32] build upon the rock
[2:13:35] and when you make your your home bam
[2:13:38] just see
[2:13:39] how is it homosexual fundamental how the
[2:13:42] foundation is
[2:13:53] that's where he gets in the most
[2:13:57] sometimes you don't need the right
[2:13:59] materials
[2:14:01] and you don't mix in the right material
[2:14:04] you understand me
[2:14:06] a
[2:14:09] underground underground
[2:14:16] the underground that you need to lay the
[2:14:18] foundation upon
[2:14:22] brother Brandon
[2:14:24] tells us
[2:14:26] and the message the statue of a perfect
[2:14:29] man
[2:14:30] they're here
[2:14:33] the builders contractors
[2:14:54] [Applause]
[2:14:57] there'll be no problems
[2:15:00] nothing will fall down
[2:15:06] the inspector of the city won't come
[2:15:10] and then come with the the plans
[2:15:13] written in the book
[2:15:16] is there any Builders here okay
[2:15:21] this is
[2:15:23] and here are the the plans
[2:15:26] a
[2:15:39] they make amendments
[2:15:43] you understand me but I'm not going to
[2:15:45] get into that
[2:15:57] we need the Capstone to come upon it
[2:16:01] yeah as a wise master builder Paul says
[2:16:05] uh just a few moments ago I spoke with
[2:16:07] some brothers there were some ministers
[2:16:13] to tell you something foreign
[2:16:25] do it all over again
[2:16:28] there won't be a pay if you don't fix
[2:16:31] that
[2:16:35] and gets angry
[2:16:39] it's worthless
[2:16:41] rejected
[2:16:48] that has a license
[2:17:18] to the prophet
[2:17:23] about being baptized in the name of the
[2:17:26] Lord Jesus Christ
[2:17:29] I don't want
[2:17:32] my home to come down
[2:17:35] but the Lord made it easy
[2:17:42] that's what I'm saying I don't know what
[2:17:44] the Lord says
[2:17:45] the pastor also gave me a license for a
[2:17:48] little bit more time
[2:17:51] but I want to say this on behalf of the
[2:17:53] message
[2:17:56] the message living dying buried and
[2:17:59] resurrecting
[2:18:03] the penalty of of death uh the penalty
[2:18:06] of sin is death
[2:18:08] and there was no one that could pay it
[2:18:12] there was no way
[2:18:15] there was only one foreign
[2:18:31] foreign
[2:18:48] to pay the price
[2:18:56] sin no longer has
[2:19:00] when he cried it is finished
[2:19:03] sin died
[2:19:06] the unbelief it ended
[2:19:09] and now it's dead
[2:19:12] that's in
[2:19:17] the prophet said the enemy of the human
[2:19:19] race
[2:19:22] no longer has life
[2:19:24] it no longer has an effect
[2:19:29] when it's received When My Sacrifice is
[2:19:32] received amen amen
[2:19:39] they needed
[2:19:41] to please God to find favor
[2:19:45] to be able to go back
[2:20:01] where
[2:20:03] they used to walk
[2:20:06] do we want to go back there Brothers
[2:20:11] have the message come for that see
[2:20:14] yes
[2:20:17] the prophet said
[2:20:19] the blood of Jesus Christ and his
[2:20:22] righteousness
[2:20:26] it has connected us
[2:20:37] I put this on
[2:20:41] es because the servants needed them De
[2:20:45] Los Reyes of the king of the king
[2:20:47] servants needed them
[2:20:48] that's where the use of the tie comes
[2:20:50] from
[2:20:52] and the prophet told us
[2:20:55] that the minister is
[2:20:57] a servant
[2:20:59] and he's a public servant
[2:21:02] whether it's hot Aya whether it's cold
[2:21:09] he has to continue to serve
[2:21:13] is
[2:21:15] follow me
[2:21:19] I love this Epistle of Hebrews
[2:21:22] just like Romans
[2:21:26] I tell my son
[2:21:29] he's studying law
[2:21:33] Romanos and I tell them Romans
[2:21:36] it's going to talk to you to teach you a
[2:21:38] lot about laws
[2:21:40] I know maybe some might not understand
[2:21:42] in
[2:22:32] great grandfather
[2:22:37] would gather intense
[2:22:40] you understand me
[2:22:43] Hebrews
[2:22:49] verse 11.
[2:22:55] Hebrews chapter 9 verse 11. foreign
[2:23:39] see
[2:23:43] just once in the Holy Place
[2:23:50] Eternal Redemption
[2:23:52] what is redemption
[2:23:55] is
[2:24:00] our original condition
[2:24:03] doesn't that make you happy yeah
[2:24:10] we're already marching
[2:24:14] we're on the Third Exodus see yes
[2:24:18] we're marching yesterday
[2:24:21] I've been preaching back home
[2:24:23] about the way of the election how many
[2:24:27] are left here
[2:24:28] how many pre-ordained on behalf yeah
[2:24:32] so you go keep marching
[2:24:36] under the pillars the angel of the Lord
[2:24:40] a prophet like Moses
[2:24:46] marking the way to the people for the
[2:24:49] people
[2:24:50] here's one of those priests
[2:24:53] foreign
[2:25:08] Sanctified to the purifying of the flesh
[2:25:12] how much more
[2:25:15] La Sangre de Cristo shout the blood of
[2:25:18] Christ foreign
[2:25:53] see right
[2:25:55] the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:25:59] and so for this cause
[2:26:01] he's the mediator
[2:26:04] of a new testament a New Covenant see
[2:26:10] that means
[2:26:24] I don't know how many calls we have here
[2:26:27] would receive the promise of the Eternal
[2:26:31] inheritance
[2:26:33] Eternal inheritance
[2:26:37] to receive an inheritance
[2:26:43] it's always been ours that's
[2:26:57] eternal
[2:27:01] principles
[2:27:03] in the beginning it says Christ the high
[2:27:06] priest
[2:27:21] and you know the Spanish language
[2:27:24] it comes from Latin
[2:27:27] and in the Latin
[2:27:30] a high priest
[2:27:33] comes the word bridge
[2:27:39] to do in Latin or Italian is to do
[2:27:45] and so one that came to make a bridge
[2:27:51] we were separated
[2:27:57] one deep
[2:27:59] that's message me
[2:28:03] the bridge
[2:28:07] the Seven Seals
[2:28:11] no one cries unless the prophet says
[2:28:15] men fell into it
[2:28:17] there was no way of going back
[2:28:21] it must be tough to be in there no ideas
[2:28:27] not that it was difficult
[2:28:30] and I want to say this to encourage
[2:28:33] for those that went into prayer
[2:28:35] that's why I spoke of a foundation
[2:28:38] then the enemy's going to want to come
[2:28:40] and steal from you what is yours it's
[2:28:44] your inheritance
[2:28:50] it pertains to us
[2:28:54] so when you're conscious of that
[2:28:57] how are you going to believe
[2:29:00] that you have to ask
[2:29:03] and ask upon if that's yours
[2:29:15] you understand me
[2:29:18] someone went through sickness someone
[2:29:22] asked for the Holy Spirit
[2:29:26] someone asked for some problems
[2:29:30] [Applause]
[2:29:40] it's yours
[2:29:42] you are the children of God
[2:29:46] you're God's children
[2:29:48] what is it that we need in Eden
[2:29:51] but that's where we're headed
[2:29:54] it pertains to us
[2:29:58] now it's a little hot
[2:30:01] ter but we have ended here
[2:30:08] yeah someone said it's going to be
[2:30:10] hotter over there
[2:30:15] on one occasion
[2:30:18] I'm just going to speak a little
[2:30:24] bit
[2:30:25] once brother Brandon
[2:30:28] experience he told us his experience
[2:30:32] how he was out in the hurricane
[2:30:35] do you remember that
[2:30:37] and you know that he got lost there
[2:30:41] he couldn't find his way out
[2:30:44] many times that happens to us
[2:31:35] how is it possible that I can be lost
[2:31:38] do you remember that
[2:31:42] Eduardo
[2:31:44] is
[2:31:45] brother Eduardo 30 years ago he was
[2:31:47] baptized
[2:31:50] and now he's ministering for the Lord
[2:31:54] occasion could have been lost
[2:31:57] how could that be
[2:32:06] he gave him a lesson to our prophet
[2:32:13] the storm
[2:32:15] s
[2:32:22] where you were able to to find yourself
[2:32:36] but there was something precious in the
[2:32:38] cabin
[2:32:40] his wife
[2:32:42] little son Billy Paul say science six
[2:32:46] years old
[2:32:49] they will die
[2:32:56] if I don't managed to get there to them
[2:32:58] because they don't know how to get
[2:32:59] around them you remember
[2:33:02] foreign
[2:33:04] Brothers
[2:33:10] after going around a few times I thought
[2:33:14] okay
[2:33:15] wrong expert that I was an expert pero
[2:33:19] luego algo
[2:33:23] came to my mind for me to understand
[2:33:27] that I was not sufficient
[2:33:31] I wasn't as an expert as I thought
[2:33:35] even though even though
[2:33:37] he wouldn't give up
[2:33:39] that happens many times to us
[2:33:50] that's not for me
[2:33:53] that could be for someone else a little
[2:33:56] weak in faith
[2:33:58] someone that's just starting
[2:34:01] not for me
[2:34:03] I can help others
[2:34:06] but here was our Prophet
[2:34:09] going in circles
[2:34:12] and the Nightfall coming
[2:34:29] when you have time to read the seven
[2:34:31] compound names of Jehovah and then go
[2:34:33] over to the message a guide
[2:34:36] his mind started to tell him
[2:34:39] what's going on are you going crazy
[2:34:46] because it started to bounce between
[2:34:48] intellect
[2:34:50] and that which was in his heart
[2:34:54] we've got two means
[2:34:57] you know that right
[2:34:59] but the Lord with this one he can't work
[2:35:03] he's got to work with this one right
[2:35:06] here
[2:35:11] and like our brother was telling us
[2:35:33] the Lord wants us to just take things
[2:35:35] off
[2:35:36] house
[2:35:53] is
[2:35:56] starting to now getting even hotter
[2:36:01] the issue is
[2:36:38] [Applause]
[2:36:41] I'm lost
[2:36:48] but there's my family as well
[2:36:50] I tell that to my beloved brother
[2:37:26] but it has to be spoken to our hearts
[2:37:35] it was getting dark
[2:37:37] ER
[2:37:40] until you remember that life there was
[2:37:44] that telephone line
[2:37:46] that communication that was always there
[2:37:54] that dance
[2:37:56] it didn't let him see
[2:37:59] when he humbled himself
[2:38:03] then the Lord opened up a Hole
[2:38:07] In This Cloud
[2:38:10] and there's where you found that
[2:38:17] here installed years ago with the man
[2:38:20] the owner of that ranch do you remember
[2:38:21] that
[2:38:42] until he came down
[2:38:45] he came down the life of
[2:38:47] life and he connected
[2:39:02] but first things first
[2:39:05] that righteous Lifeline
[2:39:09] all the way to the Savior where I went
[2:39:13] to El Salvador where I live
[2:39:18] in English
[2:39:21] maybe 50 60 times within the country of
[2:39:24] United States
[2:39:27] who knows it is that little flea the
[2:39:29] America of America
[2:39:51] I don't know truly pero momento there
[2:39:55] was a moment
[2:39:58] where the line was long
[2:40:02] and the prophet's arm got tired
[2:40:06] and that happens
[2:40:09] because the arm gets tired many times
[2:40:13] from keep touching the line yeah
[2:40:18] you know that he walked a lot muchas
[2:40:21] many miles
[2:40:31] it starts to hurt
[2:40:49] there was a line of communication and we
[2:40:53] stopped praying
[2:40:54] foreign
[2:41:33] that's our message right
[2:41:37] pero terminal
[2:41:41] a guide
[2:41:45] that I mean you know end here
[2:41:50] my arm got so tired
[2:41:54] I couldn't hold it
[2:41:57] I had to bring it down
[2:42:01] but I held on to that wire
[2:42:04] I threw my rifle on the ground
[2:42:09] many times
[2:42:22] you have to go to what God provides us
[2:42:26] what God provides is even better now
[2:42:33] foreign
[2:42:50] deadline
[2:42:57] is
[2:43:02] because back then he didn't know that I
[2:43:04] was going to serve him a purpose
[2:43:08] the line got a hold of him
[2:43:10] [Music]
[2:43:13] 23.
[2:44:11] and I'll trust in him the rest of the
[2:44:13] way
