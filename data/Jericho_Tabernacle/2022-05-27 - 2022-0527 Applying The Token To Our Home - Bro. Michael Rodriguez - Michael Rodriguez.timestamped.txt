[31:11] alvarez
[31:15] hermanos hermanas
[31:26] and she's asking for her parents yes
[31:29] and i believe each and each youth here
[31:35] you guys have the authority to ask for
[31:36] your parents as well
[31:40] verse 14 and the man answered her our
[31:43] lives for yours if ye utter not this our
[31:46] business and it shall be when the lord
[31:48] has given us the land that we will
[31:51] deal kindly and truly with thee
[31:55] respond
[32:10] then she let them down by a cord through
[32:13] the window for her house was upon the
[32:15] town
[32:16] wall and she dwelled upon the wall
[32:19] entonces
[32:25] casa estaba
[32:30] and she said unto them get you to the
[32:32] mountains least the pursuers meet you
[32:35] and hide yourselves
[32:36] there are three days until the pursuers
[32:38] be returned and afterward may ye go your
[32:41] way
[32:45] foreign
[32:58] and the man said unto her we will be
[33:01] blameless of this stein oath which
[33:03] thou has made us swear
[33:08] on
[33:15] behold when we come into the land thou
[33:17] shalt bind this line of scarlet thread
[33:20] in the window which out that is let us
[33:22] down by and thou shall bring thy father
[33:25] and thy mother and thy brethren and all
[33:28] thy fathers household
[33:30] household home unto thee
[33:50] and it shall be that whosoever shall go
[33:52] out of the doors of thy house into the
[33:54] street his blood shall be upon his head
[33:57] and we will be guiltless and whosoever
[34:00] shall be with thee in the house his
[34:02] blood shall be on our head if any hand
[34:05] be upon him
[34:07] foreign
[34:22] and if thou utter this our business then
[34:24] we will be quick of thine oath which
[34:26] thou has made us to swear
[34:47] and she sent them away and they departed
[34:49] and she bound the scarlet line in the
[34:51] window
[34:59] you may be seated
[35:05] you know this is a a beautiful
[35:07] beautiful story
[35:10] i i don't know about you but i identify
[35:13] with rahab
[35:16] identification
[35:17] and it's made a big impact in my life
[35:23] you know to realize what god could do on
[35:25] somebody like her
[35:27] the realization
[35:31] and that's exactly what he did with me
[35:33] yes
[35:36] um so i just want to get a little point
[35:39] across no mosquito
[35:42] destiny you know just pretty much bring
[35:45] it as a testimony
[35:49] of a family altar
[35:54] how many can
[35:56] you know i want to open my heart with
[35:58] you guys
[36:00] i i just want to bring it so simple
[36:04] i wish we could be together at the hall
[36:06] with the youth
[36:10] because that's where i feel more
[36:11] comfortable
[36:14] um
[36:15] but i just want to be honest with you
[36:17] guys
[36:19] i want to be open
[36:22] and and maybe you guys could be honest
[36:24] with yourselves
[36:28] and i i want to ask you a question
[36:31] how many can you say that you that
[36:34] that we may wasted most of our our time
[36:36] on worldly things
[37:06] he wants the vision he wants separation
[37:10] he wants death between us
[37:13] and and i think that he's doing a good
[37:15] job
[37:18] but we are overcomers pero nosotros is
[37:22] you know it's been a big burden
[37:24] realizing that i had been misplacing or
[37:27] misleading my family
[37:35] you know wasting our times on watching
[37:37] tv
[37:41] how many watch tv
[37:45] okay i guess now everybody has tv praise
[37:50] you know we watch movies
[37:54] we waste our time watching those short
[37:56] videos on youtube
[37:59] videos on youtube uh maybe maybe we
[38:02] don't
[38:03] maybe we're not watching nothing bad
[38:07] but we are wasting our time
[38:10] we are not giving the lord his time
[38:14] you know there's there's there's so many
[38:16] things that there's been distractions in
[38:18] our lives
[38:22] and it's misleading our our youth and
[38:24] our children
[38:29] you know i it has been a burden in my
[38:32] heart
[38:35] the school systems
[38:38] you know they're they're molding our our
[38:40] youth and our children
[38:44] they have the power to mold our children
[38:46] and our youth
[38:50] or even in the colleges
[38:53] you know they're they have they have
[38:55] they have us for 40 hours a week
[39:00] and they're feeding us whatever they
[39:01] want to feed us
[39:04] and it scares me to
[39:06] to realize that that's what's happening
[39:08] to my children
[39:14] and i and it makes me feel like
[39:16] i'm a failure as a pastor to my home
[39:19] center
[39:22] now i'm being open with you guys this
[39:24] evening
[39:47] you know it's it's those living
[39:48] testimonies
[39:50] testimonials
[39:51] of of other brethren like us
[39:55] that we go visit their homes
[39:58] and
[39:59] and then it hurts when we don't see a tv
[40:01] on the wall
[40:05] or it hurts us that their kids are
[40:07] praying much better
[40:26] so i seen all these testimonies
[40:29] testimonials all these brothers
[40:32] you know it's encouraged me to make a
[40:34] decision in my home
[40:51] tiempo and have family alter with their
[40:53] parents
[40:57] you know there's a lot of division
[40:58] between dad and mom and and and the
[41:01] children and the youth
[41:04] mother
[41:07] but the word could bring us together
[41:13] you know so we we started to do family
[41:16] altar comments
[41:19] and by all means i i'm not saying we're
[41:21] perfect
[41:24] we don't do it every day
[41:26] but we're doing our best to to make that
[41:29] happen
[41:33] just just so you can have a little uh
[41:35] idea of what a family altar is
[41:41] or how we do it at home
[41:45] you know we
[41:46] we choose a message together
[41:51] and um and we listen for 30 minutes or
[41:54] an hour yes
[41:58] sometimes less
[42:01] menos and i usually ask one of the
[42:02] children to pray
[42:04] regularly
[42:07] so you know we pray we listen to the
[42:09] tape or ramos
[42:12] and and then we all have our little
[42:14] notebooks
[42:17] and at the end of the message
[42:20] we all voice our opinion of what we
[42:22] learned
[42:27] and
[42:28] and
[42:30] you know god has come down on the scene
[42:34] no it might see something simple
[42:38] but god has come down in our in our
[42:39] living room
[42:43] you know and it's
[42:44] i think our children need to see that
[42:46] more often on our youth
[42:50] you know
[42:51] where we get so
[42:54] used to yeah
[42:56] just to come to church
[42:58] iglesia but then we don't even pray
[43:00] together at home
[43:04] can't even talk about god at our homes
[43:09] and that's scary yes
[43:38] at this one time on our family altar
[43:45] family you know we're listening to a
[43:46] message
[43:49] and
[43:50] and god is clearly talking to me idiot
[43:54] and you know i'm at the point of of
[43:56] breaking down yes
[43:59] and
[44:00] and my my son turns around
[44:04] out of nowhere
[44:05] and he says
[44:10] god is talking to you
[44:12] you know how how beautiful that is
[44:16] to have the unity around the world
[44:20] already
[44:29] he was wondering because we we heard
[44:31] about the gifts
[44:36] and and he heard in the tape you know
[44:38] that we all have a gift
[44:42] and the very next day at sunday school
[44:48] you know
[44:49] his questions was answered
[44:52] and and the these kids my kids are
[44:55] always telling me you know they're
[44:57] talking to me about the message
[45:01] you know we we go out with a
[45:04] family salimos con una famiglia and and
[45:07] sometimes you know they see that things
[45:09] are wrong
[45:12] and and they call it out
[45:18] and and sometimes it's like oh be quiet
[45:21] don't say that too loud
[45:26] because
[45:28] we don't want them to hurt anybody
[45:30] uh
[45:33] but i i feel that we're identified with
[45:36] rahab because she had
[45:38] done the same thing with her family
[45:44] she applied the token to her home
[45:47] [Music]
[45:49] now she
[45:50] if we listen to the message
[45:53] you know brother branham says
[45:57] that it was two
[45:58] tape boys
[46:06] you know
[46:07] that's what we're doing today
[46:10] we're applying the tape to to our homes
[46:12] applicants
[46:26] slipped in somewhere
[46:30] for the predestinated seed
[46:34] they slipped over to her her house
[46:39] and play some tapes
[46:43] she made her house a church to service
[46:46] the message
[46:51] to receive the message
[46:53] you know how that for me that speaks so
[46:56] loud
[46:59] we have to make the altar
[47:04] it is so important
[47:06] to play the messages at our house
[47:10] it has to be playing day in and day out
[47:15] we want them to penetrate the walls
[47:19] to the deepest room
[47:22] talking about our physical home
[47:26] physical and i'm talking about our
[47:28] physical being
[47:36] you know um this shows us that rahab
[47:39] received the messenger
[47:41] yes
[47:45] and the message of her time
[47:48] and that is exactly what we should be
[47:50] doing
[48:05] we need to accept the message and the
[48:06] messenger
[48:15] this is um
[48:16] on the token
[48:31] his messenger had preached
[48:36] joshua when he said that
[48:40] don't touch that house or anything in it
[48:44] [Music]
[48:46] oh
[48:48] it's served for the lord
[48:52] amen a
[48:53] gentile a harlot street walker a man

[51:09] you know in moses
[51:12] you know the sign was the blood
[51:16] but there was no life in that blood
[51:19] it was just a foreshadow of what it is
[51:22] today
[51:26] and that's the lord jesus christ
[51:29] this blood is the one that could save us
[51:33] and the token is the single ghost es el
[51:36] espirito santo
[51:50] what do we do when we apply the token to
[51:52] our home
[51:55] what do we do when we apply the token to
[51:57] our home
[52:01] says if you want to read another one
[52:06] acts 16 31.
[52:11] paul told the centurion

[52:48] just before judgment
[52:51] you believe it

[54:13] and brother ben is telling them move all
[54:15] the trash out
[54:17] of him
[54:19] get all the short skirts
[54:22] sakato
[54:36] and what whatever more
[54:38] equal
[54:40] and kick them out the door is affordable
[54:44] you're going to apply the token
[54:48] won't stand still for it

[56:09] everything out of our lives
[56:14] all these worldly things
[56:16] to receive the token
[56:22] like jacob did a second issue he said
[56:26] and he said he told his wife
[56:41] put away them gods
[56:44] put away them gods
[56:46] take those gods out
[56:50] amen you know what joshua said for
[56:53] crossing over

[57:58] apply the token this evening
[58:03] you guys want to clean up your homes

[58:19] let's just clean our lives
[58:23] let's take out all these worldly things
[58:24] out of our lives
[58:28] so he could enter in
[58:30] puerto
[58:39] it says his messenger
[58:43] turned back and said
[58:46] i have obeyed your orders
[59:02] we found a woman that believed in
[59:04] controversy
[59:05] and we told her that all
[59:07] that would come under the red sign back
[59:11] there the token
[59:14] person
[59:16] it would
[59:43] signal to destroy the whole the whole
[59:45] thing
[59:49] went right straight up
[59:54] and rehab
[59:56] and all her people said right he told us
[1:00:12] and they didn't have to look out the
[1:00:14] window
[1:00:17] they could read the scripture while the
[1:00:19] battle was going on
[1:00:25] no matter what
[1:00:46] what word is it the word of this of this
[1:00:48] hour
[1:01:00] i'm going to read you a a
[1:01:04] a testimony let's
[1:01:06] testify
[1:01:09] it says uh greetings in the name of the
[1:01:11] lord jesus christ saludos in the hombre
[1:01:13] del senor christo we are writing this
[1:01:15] testimony from ukraine
[1:01:20] first of all we want to thank everyone
[1:01:33] my sister and i are in the
[1:01:36] dorms of our university
[1:01:44] where two or three are gathered together
[1:01:46] in my name
[1:01:49] there i am
[1:01:54] the bible says in matthew 18 20.
[1:02:04] and while explosions and gun volleys
[1:02:07] rumbled outside
[1:02:12] outside the window
[1:02:14] my sister and i hit the play button
[1:02:20] and if i were asked what was the best
[1:02:22] time of my life
[1:02:27] i would say with one hundred percent
[1:02:30] certainty that it is now
[1:02:44] we clearly hear him answering us in
[1:02:46] these sermons
[1:02:51] i am glad that in such a terrible
[1:02:53] situation
[1:02:58] when people are trembling with fear and
[1:03:01] panic
[1:03:03] foreign
[1:03:05] quotes from brother branham tapes
[1:03:08] sintas
[1:03:09] menzakis de nostromano branham christian
[1:03:11] hymns like onward christian soldier
[1:03:14] cantando
[1:03:21] in jesus name and many others come to
[1:03:24] our minds
[1:03:28] i am glad that god sent us this test
[1:03:34] for he tests all his children
[1:03:37] he wants to appear on the last day
[1:03:39] amongst the victors
[1:03:43] those who have withstood god's test and
[1:03:46] kept the faith
[1:03:50] there is a martial law in the city
[1:03:53] i lay and i and i see that so when the
[1:03:55] siren sounds everyone has to go down to
[1:03:57] the bomb shelters
[1:04:03] but honestly it's very disturbing
[1:04:08] there are a lot of people there
[1:04:10] ai muncha
[1:04:14] except for me and my sister except
[1:04:17] there are not enough things to stay
[1:04:20] there comfortably
[1:04:24] many
[1:04:28] make noise curse and behave badly
[1:04:30] asenrido imalicen in addition there is
[1:04:33] poor communication and no
[1:04:36] internet
[1:04:37] departed
[1:04:52] running out
[1:05:24] and i remembered what i had been taught
[1:05:26] since i was a little girl
[1:05:28] recorded
[1:05:31] my parents had taught me to look for
[1:05:33] answers in god's word mr
[1:05:46] and peace and inspiration came to my
[1:05:48] heart to stay
[1:05:49] inspiration
[1:05:52] we had a wonderful night in the room
[1:05:56] the lord gave us a good and sound sleep
[1:06:10] and she replied that it would remind her
[1:06:13] of the harlot rahab
[1:06:16] responded
[1:06:48] it gave me confidence that we are
[1:06:51] perfectly safe as long as the message is
[1:06:54] heard in our room
[1:07:03] a little later god confirmed it again
[1:07:06] a little later god confirmed it again
[1:07:13] and the sermon the patriarch abraham and
[1:07:16] el salman el patriarca abram
[1:07:19] this is a testimony from two young
[1:07:20] ladies is a testimonial
[1:07:23] in ukraine and ukraine
[1:07:26] where they couldn't have any shelter
[1:07:32] with peace
[1:07:36] and they decided to stay in the room
[1:07:39] they weren't allowed to stay in the room
[1:07:45] but they decided to stay there because
[1:07:47] that's the only place they could push
[1:07:49] play perez
[1:07:54] i believe yo crayon
[1:07:56] that that's what we should be doing
[1:07:58] today
[1:08:01] we should be listening to the tapes day
[1:08:03] in and day out
[1:08:06] it sounds like i repeat myself all the
[1:08:08] time
[1:08:12] but there's no greater thing than to
[1:08:13] listen to the hour to the message of
[1:08:15] this hour
[1:08:21] ray have accepted that message hour for
[1:08:23] her time
[1:08:26] she made a family altar
[1:08:29] familiar that and she was saved
[1:08:32] that's what we have to do
[1:08:35] what's going on in the world
[1:08:39] we have to have the confidence in this
[1:08:41] message
[1:08:47] it has to be everything for us
[1:08:58] i don't know what else to tell you
[1:09:02] we always have to be listening to the
[1:09:03] tape siempre tenemos
[1:09:12] it says and then you people that listen
[1:09:14] to this
[1:09:15] on tape

[1:10:08] home not just one
[1:10:10] record
[1:10:13] the whole home
[1:10:14] the tot
[1:10:27] we should love each other
[1:10:30] and believers should separate themselves
[1:10:32] from the world
