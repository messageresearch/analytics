[2:27] USA Mar br
[2:38] Indiana
[2:40] norica now this morning just uh prior to
[2:45] the prayer for the
[2:47] sick uh we are going to read some of
[2:50] God's word which we know that without
[2:53] this word it's impossible there's
[2:56] nothing can be done and only the word
[2:58] can produce uh these blessings that
[3:01] we're asking for the sick and the
[3:22] needy and I want to read some now from
[3:25] first Peter the 5th chapter beginning
[3:29] with the first verse and then from the
[3:32] book of Hebrews I want to read Hebrews
[3:35] 2 uh 2-
[3:48] 4 the elders which are among you I exal
[3:53] whom am also an elder and a witness of
[3:57] the suffering of Christ and also a
[4:00] partaker of the glory that shall be
[4:17] revealed feed the flock of God which is
[4:20] among you take the oversight
[4:25] thereof not by constraint but willing
[4:30] ly not for filthy
[4:34] lucer but of a ready
[4:38] mind neither as being Lords over God's
[4:42] Heritage but being examples to
[4:58] the
[5:11] and when the chief Shepherd shall appear
[5:14] ye shall receive a Crown of Glory that
[5:16] fadeth not
[5:24] away likewise ye younger submit
[5:28] yourselves on to the
[5:30] Elder yay all of you be subject one to
[5:35] another and be not clo and be clothed
[5:39] with humility for God resisteth the
[5:42] proud and giveth grace to the
[5:58] humble
[6:06] humble yourselves under the mighty hand
[6:08] of God that he may exalt you in due
[6:14] time casting all your care upon him for
[6:19] he careth for
[6:28] you
[6:37] and in Hebrews the 2
[6:40] chapter we read these
[6:43] words now I'm pulling for giving for a
[6:47] text cast in your care I'm my text is he
[6:51] cares do you
[6:58] care
[7:09] want to read this portion now while
[7:11] you're turning to Hebrews 2 that you
[7:14] might see the the real meaning of these
[7:17] words what the what this text
[7:28] means
[7:32] therefore we ought to give the more
[7:33] Earnest heed to the things which we have
[7:36] heard lest at any time we should let
[7:40] them slip for if the words spoken by
[7:43] Angels were was stud fast and every
[7:47] transgression and Disobedience received
[7:49] a just recompense of
[7:58] reward
[8:12] how shall we escape if we neglect so
[8:15] great
[8:16] salvation which at the first
[8:19] begin to be spoken by the Lord and was
[8:23] confirmed unto us by them that heard
[8:28] him
[8:40] God also bearing witness with both with
[8:44] signs and wonders and diverse Miracles
[8:47] and Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to
[8:50] his own will
[8:58] ttif
[9:03] [Music]
[9:04] I want to use the subject
[9:06] here of he
[9:09] cares and do
[9:18] you when he was sh on
[9:22] Earth he cared for the
[9:26] people the thought of it rises in my
[9:29] mind just before speaking or praying for
[9:32] the
[9:33] sick not knowing just what kind of a of
[9:37] a prayer line that we'll
[9:53] have uh uh
[9:55] first to approach this the audience must
[9:59] must be Anointed with
[10:01] faith you if you do not have faith then
[10:05] there's there's no need of even coming
[10:07] to be prayed for because it's going to
[10:10] take your faith and my faith together my
[10:14] faith to believe him your faith to
[10:16] believe
[10:28] him
[10:40] so we don't forget this now as we go
[10:43] along we've got to have something
[10:47] evidently with evidence I mean that we
[10:50] can base our faith upon what we're
[10:53] trying to
[10:58] do
[11:08] because if a man approaches anything
[11:11] that he wants to do without sufficient
[11:14] Faith he's bound to be a
[11:16] failure but if he can approach it with
[11:19] sufficient Faith then he's Bound To
[11:22] Succeed if it is according to God's Will
[11:25] and purpose to do it
[11:50] now I was thinking of him
[11:53] caring last evening somehow Strangely I
[11:56] was
[11:57] led by the Holy Spirit when I was
[12:01] waiting on some fellas to come to help
[12:03] brother wood to put a a trailer he had
[12:06] build on the back of his
[12:20] [Music]
[12:23] truck I didn't know why I was trying to
[12:26] find my good friend brother Evans and I
[12:29] went started up the highway which my
[12:32] wife and family setting back here knows
[12:35] it to be true and somehow Strangely I
[12:38] turned around and went back to a
[12:41] place a
[12:57] motel oh how it thrilled my heart to see
[13:00] so many my friends gathered there in
[13:02] about two minutes time till it clogged
[13:05] the pathway the cars couldn't pass to no
[13:07] more just real friends driving for
[13:10] hundreds of miles from Georgia and
[13:12] Tennessee and and Alabama and all around
[13:16] just the the
[13:18] he a
[13:27] service
[13:36] [Music]
[13:42] then that that thought come on my mind
[13:44] then what should I say to those people
[13:47] knowing that in the day of judgment I
[13:48] have to answer for what I tell
[13:51] them and I too am a am a lover of this
[13:56] great life that is to come and I I want
[13:58] to be
[14:13] [Music]
[14:17] there and then Strangely I went to a
[14:21] place where I made a odd turn instead of
[14:23] turning around there I went up to make a
[14:25] turn the lights flashed on I love L
[14:29] couples on the outside two fine young
[14:32] ladies that i' just married to two fine
[14:36] young

[15:01] right here this altar it went away
[15:03] happily on the honeymoon and and the
[15:05] enemy jumped on to this young
[15:22] man and I'm saying this to express what
[15:25] I'm saying does he
[15:27] care somehow with faith that would not
[15:31] take no they turned and returned back
[15:34] here knowing actually it was all way
[15:36] over in way in the East here somewhere

[16:36] man sitting there just in the peak of
[16:38] his life a leader of young man sitting
[16:43] there in the
[16:55] Satan he never noticed but I tuck my
[16:58] hand left to shake hands with his hand
[17:00] right to see if some disease had plagued
[17:03] him but there was no sign of
[17:16] vibration coming right out of the room
[17:18] from praying and fasting and waiting
[17:21] upon the Lord the anointing of the Holy
[17:23] Spirit was there that's why it l us
[17:27] see
[17:36] and then seing this Shadow Of Darkness
[17:38] over him I never said what I was doing
[17:40] but in less than a couple of moments
[17:42] time it was all gone the coldness of his
[17:45] hands had left he was shouting and
[17:47] praising God few minutes to find
[17:49] themselves in here they set right here
[17:50] this morning sitting in the
[17:57] audience
[18:15] see how Satan was trying to upset that
[18:18] young man by referring to him as some
[18:21] complex to be built back which the Holy
[18:24] Spirit knew and uh seen it by the vision
[18:27] of the Lord but God cared for that man
[18:31] God cared for that young
[18:50] boy just coming in a few moments ago a
[18:53] lady I see her sitting here in the aisle
[18:55] with no or just got her seat somewhere
[18:58] and sat
[18:59] down she said nine years brother brandom
[19:03] I've tried to get a hold of you and she
[19:05] said I'm so desperate here late and
[19:08] couldn't even get a prayer card to be in

[19:27] line
[19:30] Billy of course it's his orders to see
[19:33] that I'm not bothered take me in and out
[19:35] don't feel hard at Billy he's commanded
[19:37] by this Board of Trustees to do that and
[19:39] if you didn't I wouldn't be able to get
[19:41] to the prayer line and get in here you
[19:42] realize that see there's got to be a
[19:45] system to whatever we're doing we we got
[19:46] to have it
[19:57] think
[20:13] but him saying come on Daddy Hurry Up
[20:16] This the lady moved back and she said
[20:19] brother Bram just a word with you
[20:22] standing there a vision broke over this
[20:25] fine looking young woman and seeing that
[20:28] her heart was
[20:48] burdened you're trying to work and make
[20:50] a living and a great thing happened back
[20:53] way back in the time of her parents that
[20:57] had caused this great thing to happen to
[20:59] her and the Lord Jesus revealed and and
[21:03] showed what it was and there in a moment
[21:06] time took it from the
[21:25] [Music]
[21:27] woman
[21:29] she went around rejoicing and our
[21:31] sitting here in the audience with us now
[21:36] rejoicing with tears that she's wiping
[21:38] her eyes now knowing that the truth of
[21:41] the thing was made
[21:56] known and that why that poor little
[21:59] neurotic woman that was so nervous she
[22:02] didn't know what to do with herself and
[22:04] thinking that she was gone and there was
[22:05] no Holy Spirit and this is her last day
[22:08] she tried for nine years and she's about
[22:10] at the end of Despair God cared for that
[22:13] little woman who no one cares for amen
[22:18] hallelujah quite a time he does
[22:26] care
[22:50] what he was share on Earth is to say he
[22:52] cared for the people so much till he
[22:54] healed their sick comforted their hearts
[22:56] told them about a
[22:58] a place that where he would go and
[23:00] prepare for them and would come again to
[23:02] receive them unto himself he cared for
[23:21] them and
[23:24] notice he cared so much until when he he
[23:28] know he must leave in order to bring
[23:30] this great thing to us he said I'll not
[23:33] leave you
[23:36] comfortless but I will send the Holy
[23:39] Spirit and he shall continue my care for
[23:44] you until he
[23:56] returns
[24:06] there's no one cares like Jesus knowing
[24:09] that his body as a high priest in the
[24:13] meteor work that he's doing now that
[24:16] body must be in the presence of God at
[24:19] all times for intercession that God
[24:21] cannot see the sinner sin he sees only
[24:24] the blood of his own
[24:26] son
[24:48] and knowing that he sent back the Holy
[24:50] Spirit to continue to comfort his
[24:55] people does he care sir certainly he
[25:10] cares
[25:11] now he was to continue to care for the
[25:15] people his people here on Earth in the
[25:19] same manner that he cared for him when
[25:21] he was here because he said in St John
[25:24] the 15th chapter if you want to make
[25:26] I've got notes laning Here with these
[25:27] scripture here's where I'm referring to
[25:29] St John 1526 and
[25:49] 27 I see many of you wrri the scriptures
[25:51] down so I may refer to this if you don't
[25:54] know it many times to the scripture I
[25:55] write the scripture down then I know
[25:57] what I'm speaking of from here because
[25:59] it's always in the word of the Lord
[26:15] see he said when the Holy Spirit has
[26:19] come who the father would s in his
[26:23] name he would testify of him in other
[26:26] words he would do the same thing he did
[26:29] the Holy Spirit working through a
[26:31] tabernacle that he had Sanctified would
[26:33] do the same thing that he
[26:46] [Music]
[26:55] did now what that ought to do do for us
[26:58] then we know that right among us today
[27:01] we have the same comforting Lord Jesus
[27:05] in the form of the Holy Ghost another
[27:08] office that God himself is working
[27:26] in
[27:30] he was a comfort to Israel when they
[27:33] could look up and see the pillar of fire
[27:36] and he the prophets speak the words that
[27:38] was true and God
[27:40] Vindicated that was their
[27:54] comfort he was a comfort when he was
[27:56] here on Earth as a man God made flesh
[28:00] God representing himself and expressing
[28:02] himself through a a man Christ Jesus who
[28:05] promised that the works that I do shall
[28:07] you do
[28:24] also now I'm going to the father and go
[28:27] to back the Holy Spirit which will be me
[28:30] and spirit farm and I'll be with you and
[28:32] dwell in you and the very same things
[28:35] that I've have done here the holy spirit
[28:37] will do again in my name when he
[28:56] comes
[28:59] that's why he said to speak against that
[29:00] now after the atonements already made
[29:02] was unpardonable sin to blaspheme the
[29:05] holy
[29:15] go and he would do it in the same way so
[29:18] that we would know whether it was a
[29:20] comfort from some uh Earthly standpoint
[29:24] whether we know it was a comfort from
[29:26] some elders person who could put their
[29:28] arms around us and hug us a little and
[29:30] make us feel good
[29:45] or are some theological term of a
[29:50] denomination that would say now you
[29:52] belong to us and we got it and don't
[29:54] belong to the rest of them because they
[29:56] haven't
[30:07] he made this directly
[30:11] sure see he will speak in my
[30:15] name the works that I do will you do
[30:18] also when he's upon you see he would
[30:21] comfort in the same way by forgiving all
[30:25] of our sins healing all of our
[30:28] sicknesses and speaking to us of comfort
[30:30] of the Kingdom that is to
[30:55] come see proving himself among us as God
[30:59] proved himself Among Us by Jesus
[31:03] Christ and in and second timoth 1
[31:06] Timothy 3:16 it's
[31:09] written this
[31:11] way no about God without controversy we
[31:16] realize that great is the mystery of
[31:17] godliness for God was manifested in the
[31:22] flesh we saw God in flesh
[31:51] [Music]
[31:55] that was God's comfort to know that he
[31:58] Cal so much he cared for us until he
[32:00] become one of
[32:03] us God manifested In the Flesh not just
[32:06] another person but God
[32:22] himself and now to make it another step
[32:25] closer he SS the Holy Spirit to care for
[32:29] our Comforts and he abides in
[32:36] us oh he does
[32:43] [Music]
[32:50] care
[32:53] oh now we must go on to another portion
[32:56] of script scripture here or another
[32:58] thought to back this
[33:01] up before I go I might say this
[33:03] everybody doesn't have this
[33:18] comforter they they don't they don't
[33:20] have it so the reason they don't have it
[33:24] is because they don't accept it
[33:28] it's for them but they don't accept
[33:43] it now I hope that you're spiritual
[33:46] enough to to read what I'm saying see
[33:50] I'm speaking to a group of people has to
[33:52] be prayed for in a few
[33:55] minutes
[34:04] and we have this comfort in Holy Spirit
[34:07] that's sent far the comforter but all
[34:09] people won't receive that they don't
[34:11] believe in
[34:22] it they in order to do that then they uh
[34:27] together their comfort from some other
[34:29] resource some other means if they don't
[34:33] accept God's provided comforter then
[34:36] they have to get some other comforter
[34:39] see because you can't live without
[34:42] something to
[34:55] live
[35:02] and I hope that each of you get that
[35:04] especially you people has to be prayed
[35:06] for that's so uncomfortable this morning
[35:08] with maybe troubles that the doctors
[35:11] cannot
[35:23] touch we believe that doctors help
[35:25] people I believe that God heals by
[35:29] medicine God heals by surgery God heals
[35:34] by understanding God heals by
[35:49] love just a little love goes a long way
[35:52] let somebody be all upset and just show
[35:55] them you care for see God heals by
[36:08] love God heals by prayer God heals by
[36:12] Miracles God heals by his
[36:15] word God heals whatever Source it is God
[36:20] heals by it's God that heals for he said
[36:23] I the Lord that Health all thy diseases
[36:26] do
[36:44] so all of it should work together and
[36:47] man and different Ministry should work
[36:49] together far
[36:55] that
[37:01] now but they don't do it because
[37:03] sometimes they're forbidden to take
[37:06] certain stands upon God's word because
[37:09] their certain uh denominations doesn't
[37:12] permit them to do that but that doesn't
[37:14] stop the truth just the same God goes on
[37:17] healing just the
[37:25] same
[37:36] so they try to draw comfort from some
[37:38] other resource let's speak first of the
[37:42] Soul we find out that many people try to
[37:45] find Comfort by
[37:46] drinking you know we have a saying which
[37:51] is pretty well known among us today that
[37:54] that many ministers
[37:57] drink sometime before going to the pull
[38:00] pit take a a a good heavy drink of
[38:25] intoxication
[38:28] it's been known to seeing ministers on
[38:30] the platform that even staggered under
[38:32] the influence of liquor and uh that that
[38:36] ought not be it should not be is
[38:40] because uh many times we might condemn
[38:44] the man when maybe we ought not do that
[38:47] we ought to find back what's the
[38:55] trouble
[39:11] many of them was converted from
[39:13] alcohol and we find out if they are in
[39:16] that condition it's a disgrace and a
[39:20] reproach but no more a reproach it would
[39:22] be to lie steal or lust after women or
[39:26] any other thing that's in the
[39:28] Commandment
[39:46] see and maybe a man's Born High
[39:48] passioned and he sees these modern strip
[39:51] teases on the street and he he
[39:52] constantly in
[39:54] trouble see he uh that the man is born
[39:57] like
[40:09] that now what he ought to do the
[40:13] minister that drinks or the or the woman
[40:16] that smokes or dresses immorally trying
[40:20] to draw her a comfort from being so well
[40:24] put together that she wants to cause uh
[40:28] man to look at her there's no other
[40:32] reason she is partially
[40:53] insane see no sensible woman would no to
[40:56] strip herself before man who has her
[40:59] right mind see there's no reason for it
[41:02] at
[41:10] Allen and she uh but she's trying to
[41:14] these young girls today would go out on
[41:16] the street they're real uh well you
[41:20] excuse expression and remember this tape
[41:23] don't only just to this people here it
[41:24] goes around the world see
[41:40] and um a woman that would uh take her
[41:43] clothes off from her for she knows it's
[41:48] hotter walk out there in the sun naked
[41:51] and then walk out with some clothes on
[41:52] which is the
[41:55] coolest
[42:05] the Indians down there in the papos and
[42:07] navajos the papos especially of the
[42:11] reservation those women come out with
[42:13] big yarn blankets around them and set
[42:16] out there in the sun to keep cool why
[42:18] they perspire in the wind that blows
[42:21] sets up an air conditioning you
[42:25] see
[42:42] and uh these women have no other reason
[42:45] but just they don't know it they don't
[42:47] realize it I'm not saying that they do
[42:50] many of them are fine
[42:52] women and I'm not saying it to be rude
[42:55] I'm saying it to to try to to to wake
[42:59] them up see it's only
[43:20] Satan see you realize the other sect the
[43:24] male sect looking upon such give such an
[43:27] influence to them till they'll they'll
[43:29] squeak their tires and whistle the the
[43:32] wolf whistle and and uh what do they do
[43:34] that far the women does it in order to
[43:37] get the man to do
[43:54] that what how do you get out right In
[43:57] the Heat of the day and 4:00 in the
[43:58] afternoon to mow the grass when people
[44:00] are coming from their work and things
[44:02] like that it shows it's a spirit of
[44:16] insanity I know many of might have IQ a
[44:20] million miles higher than mine but I
[44:22] test your IQ with God's word and see
[44:24] where it comes out see
[44:26] that's modern IQ but the very evidence
[44:30] and fruits of the life Pro so they try
[44:32] to find comfort with
[44:54] that many of them say well I don't do
[44:57] that but you so dress themselves in such
[45:02] an appeal till they try to be more
[45:04] modern and the woman go to set by them
[45:06] in church the next morning wear a better
[45:08] hat or a little better clothes because
[45:09] you can afford to do it
[45:24] much us said Lord see see sin reaches
[45:29] way
[45:32] down and uh they try to find Comfort by
[45:35] doing so and they have it's become such
[45:38] a thing until it's absolutely struck the
[45:41] nation in whole not only the nation but
[45:44] the world in
[45:54] whole
[46:02] many things I could say here but to save
[46:04] time the healing service coming up I I
[46:07] could speak at large on this but I won't
[46:10] I'm sure you'll understand what I
[46:23] mean this uh uh it struck the political
[46:27] world the political life the social life
[46:30] the moral life of the nation of the
[46:33] peoples around the
[46:44] world it's got to a place the man wants
[46:47] to be a politician just to have the name
[46:50] of being a politician got plenty of
[46:53] money can pull votes and hire Machin
[46:55] means to do it and and so forth Just for
[46:58] the name and worth millions and millions
[47:00] of dollars see just for the name of
[47:03] being some great
[47:05] politician enough has said it that you
[47:07] know what I'm talking
[47:24] about
[47:26] [Music]
[47:38] and social life that people try to get
[47:41] together in this insane social life
[47:44] don't tell me the world's not insane
[47:47] doing the way it's doing it sure is it's
[47:49] an erotic world and by the grace of God
[47:55] was only only way we'll Escape
[48:15] it notice in this social life the people
[48:20] has come to a place that they they
[48:23] socialize little Clans and they get into
[48:26] there and think we're better than the
[48:28] next group see and it's just done that
[48:45] way it's the morals it's hit the morals
[48:49] of people until honest friends I don't
[48:51] even believe that the world the word
[48:53] moral is recognized among 90% of the
[48:56] people of this nation they don't even
[48:58] know what the world the word moral means
[49:02] it's is escaped from him and it's done
[49:04] it so
[49:24] trickery
[49:29] [Music]
[49:31] Satan is very subtle see and he does it
[49:34] so easy so so subtle just a little teeny
[49:39] bit here and a little there let it he's
[49:40] got plenty of time so he just runs a
[49:43] little bit in here and a little bit in
[49:44] here and the first thing you know the
[49:46] people just gradually move into
[49:54] it
[50:10] what would have happened of a woman uh
[50:13] back when I was a boy of 16 years old if
[50:16] she walk down the street like she does
[50:18] today in this strip teas Farm while
[50:21] they' have had her in
[50:24] jail
[50:36] well if it was wrong then it's wrong now
[50:39] see but you see Satan just begin to cut
[50:42] off the skirts and to lower them down
[50:45] and and it'll come to pass that there's
[50:47] somebody will Design One a little beyond
[50:50] the minini or what you call a thing to a
[50:53] fig Leaf you remember that's right it'll
[50:56] go right straight back and it's it's
[50:58] there practically
[51:24] now
[51:26] and now we find all those things is
[51:29] because people are trying to find
[51:33] Comfort they're trying to find something
[51:36] that they and remember your comfort is
[51:39] your
[51:40] religion and you make those things your
[51:44] religion
[51:54] see
[52:02] what a Pity in realizing that death lays
[52:04] right before you see until all this has
[52:08] happened until it seems like that
[52:10] there's not a a solid foundation left in
[52:14] the nation to build anything
[52:24] on
[52:31] just let me ask you something you can't
[52:34] believe nothing hardly but the Bible we
[52:38] still have Christ thanks to
[52:40] God you you can't believe
[52:54] anything
[52:56] you get on for instance when you turn
[52:58] your television on you that have such
[53:00] and when you turn your television on and
[53:03] see the the
[53:05] commercials well if a person tried to
[53:07] live by 100th of those commercials you d
[53:11] a week see you couldn't do
[53:24] it
[53:31] and the very thing is some company will
[53:33] break down like a product and say this
[53:37] is the thing here and don't have this
[53:40] one over here and the same company sells
[53:43] the same
[53:54] product
[53:57] then another commercial come on take
[53:58] this on this side and not that in the
[54:01] same company the American people fall
[54:04] for such stuff as that till the whole
[54:07] thing is become a rock until there's no
[54:12] hopes at
[54:24] all
[54:30] [Music]
[54:32] nobody knows what to believe but I'm
[54:35] going to tell you after a while what to
[54:37] believe if you want Comfort if the Lord
[54:48] willing the people they lie cheat steal
[54:53] tell you almost have have to have a bond
[54:57] of security to Bar $5 from somebody it's
[55:01] uh you know the Bible speaks that that
[55:03] there be no love in the last days but
[55:05] just among the elect people that's
[55:24] right the scripture speaks of that that
[55:28] uh husband to be against wife and wife
[55:30] against husband children against parents
[55:32] just among the elected of the Lord will
[55:35] there be any love
[55:47] left the churches has got into the same
[55:50] thing out of social life they brought it
[55:53] into the church their social life and
[55:56] their
[55:57] politics and their other things until
[56:00] they've got the church so confused that
[56:03] it doesn't know what to
[56:18] do they brought politics in the
[56:21] church they brought also social life
[56:24] there social life in the church your
[56:26] social
[56:27] activities uh bingo or Bunko or what
[56:31] they call it and uh these suppers and
[56:34] dances and so forth in the house of the
[56:38] Lord
[56:39] amen why it's it's
[56:53] aity
[56:58] they say well now that isn't that's on
[57:00] the annex remember it was an Annex also
[57:04] that Jesus beat the the merchants out
[57:07] with their merchandise and said it's
[57:09] written my father's house and made a
[57:10] house of prayer and youve made it a d of
[57:23] Thieves
[57:34] it's wrong I don't care where it's that
[57:36] as long as the church the church is not
[57:39] so much the building it's a people in
[57:41] the building and if those people are
[57:44] anticipating in this why it's wrong and
[57:48] they brought that
[57:53] practice
[58:06] now we find out that the churches too
[58:09] are always promising something like
[58:11] television and so forth that they never
[58:13] get to the the thing they
[58:23] promis
[58:26] as I've often said an old quotation man
[58:29] is always praising God for what he did
[58:32] praising God for what he will do looking
[58:33] forward what he will do and then ignore
[58:35] what he's doing they they they
[58:53] fail that's R they become history after
[58:56] a while of the polluted see because they
[58:59] fail to recognize
[59:10] now you can talk of the Comfort Christ
[59:13] give once and say that the Comfort he
[59:15] will give in the ages to come but refuse
[59:17] the comfort that he's got here now far
[59:18] here see it's on the same basis we find
[59:23] that
[59:37] it's become a great thing I find out
[59:41] that there they come that's even
[59:43] becoming
[59:45] Pentecost in the
[59:47] churches it's become into the
[59:49] Pentecostal Realms that they're always a
[59:52] promising something that they never get
[59:55] to
[1:00:10] it it's always that every fellow has a
[1:00:14] different sensation and and make it
[1:00:16] whether scriptural or not their promis
[1:00:18] and something that they never do get to
[1:00:21] it until it seems like it's got to a
[1:00:24] place to where there doesn't seem to be
[1:00:26] any
[1:00:41] sincerity the the people don't get down
[1:00:44] to that real kernel of
[1:00:47] sincerity it's lost the the very English
[1:00:51] word of sincerity has lost its its
[1:00:55] value to the people or about the
[1:00:59] people's way of of living it's lost its
[1:01:03] sincerity to
[1:01:23] them
[1:01:26] care
[1:01:29] for
[1:01:31] he care for
[1:01:35] you
[1:01:37] through
[1:01:38] sunshine or
