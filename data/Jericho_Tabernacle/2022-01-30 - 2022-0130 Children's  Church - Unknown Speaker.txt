up your bibles we could turn to the book of exodus chapter six we're going to be reading verse 1. the title of our of our theme today is let my people go exodus chapter 6 verse 1 reads then the lord said unto moses now shalt i see what i do to pharaoh for with the strong hand shall i let them go and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land you may be seated once again we thank you all for coming out to children's church i just want to give a small disclaimer to everybody this evening uh we're going to be bringing some biblical events to life tonight so we just want you to be a little prepared this evening did everyone enjoy the word from our young brothers tonight my brother zachary and our brother leo tremendous future preachers here of jericho tabernacle amen well this time i'd like to take everybody back to the days of moses let's take it all the way back to the days of moses back to a time where god called moses for a very special job now does any one of you know what that job was that god called moses to do yes do you know to deliver the people of israel that's right deliver the people of israel out of egypt and does anyone know where god spoke to moses to give him that job yes with the burning bush yes that's right in the burning bush that's where he spoke to moses well after god spoke to moses through that burning bush moses obeyed and he agreed to go all the way back to egypt but before we go to egypt and before we go out and we talk to pharaoh over here i need all of your little ones helps okay so you all you little ones everyone here is a christian today everyone a christian you raise your hand we're all christians okay so then you all have the power of the spoken word tonight right that's right okay so when i lift my staff up like this i want you to say let my people go okay we got we got it everyone's got it hey man that's right okay so now let's go to the bible the bible says then announce to him the lord the god of the hebrews has sent me to tell you let my people go so this is what the lord says i will show you that i am the lord and look i will strike the water of the nile with this staff in my hand and the river will turn into blood let my people go and the water turned into blood but that blood in the river it stayed water for seven whole days where nobody could drink the water nobody could jump into the water and it smelled really bad the bible says that the fishes were dying left and right all across the river there was no more way to make mon posole we couldn't make any menudo there's no more way to make some frijoles because the water had turned into blood but pharaoh he was still as stubborn as can be he did not let the people go so god had to come and bring yet another plague upon egypt does anyone know what that plague was yes it was frogs that's absolutely right the bible says then then the lord said unto moses go to pharaoh and announce to him let my people go and if you refuse i'm gonna send a plague of frogs in the nile and swarm and come out of the river and the palace and into your bedrooms and into your kitchens you guys here you guys feel those frogs where they're coming from where is coming from oh no they're everywhere they're everywhere oh no and then the frogs disappeared but pharaoh was still as stubborn as could be he did not let the people go so god had to bring yet another plague and the bible says then the lord told moses get up early in the morning and stand in pharaoh's way right down by the river and say to him this is what the lord says and if you refuse then i will send swarms of flies upon you upon your officials upon the people and all the houses and everywhere will be filled with flies till they're covered all over they're both guys here can can you hear that can you hear that where are they coming from oh flags everywhere flies flies oh no oh the flies are everywhere oh you're coming [Music] now do you think even after flies everywhere in the land that pharaoh let the people go no he did not let them go god had to send another plague the bible says go back to pharaoh and the lord commanded moses tell him what the lord the god of the hebrew says and the hand of the lord will strike your livestock strike your cows strike your horses strike the donkeys strike the camels the cattle the sheep the goats with the deadly plague where the animals would start to fall over and die and get very very sick but god still didn't stop there the bible says then the lord said to moses and aaron take a big handful of ashes from the brick furnace and go have moses toss it in the air towards pharaoh as pharaoh watches the ashes spread like fine dust over the whole land causing these festering boils and blisters upon the skin and the people oh no oh look at that oh the boil's all over people sick and dying from those boils but god didn't just stop there does anyone know what the next plague was anybody it was the hailstorm yes it was the hailstorm and the bible says so tomorrow at this time i will send a hailstorm more devastating than any in all the history of egypt that so moses lifted his staff to the sky and thunder and hail and lightning flashed towards the earth and the lord sent a tremendous hailstorm across egypt that destroyed the entire land but i'm sure you can guess pharaoh was still as stubborn as could be he did not let the people go the bible says so moses and aaron they walked out and went unto pharaoh and they said this is what the lord the god of the hebrew says how long will you refuse to listen to the lord let my people go so that they can worship me and if you don't listen and watch out for tomorrow i will bring a swarm of locusts upon your country locusts that will cover the entire land to where you won't even be able to see they'll eat up all your crops we here in locust running around all right back here underneath i think they're in the back of the church they're back there oh there come the locust [Music] and pharaoh saw the frogs he saw the river he saw the hailstorms his people suffering from the boils but still a stubborn face upon pharaoh he would not let the people of israel go so god had to send another plague the bible says then the lord said to moses lift your hand toward heaven and the land of egypt will be covered with darkness darkness so thick that you can't even feel it so moses lifted his hand to the sky and the darkness covered the entire land [Music] and it covered the entire land for three days but during all that time the people could not see each other and no one moved but there was light there was light in the land of goshen where the people of israel they lived and they were protected by god himself where he would watch over them and none of these plays got over them before the egyptians it was so dark there was no school there was no work there was no play time after the third day that darkness was over but then something very special happened really special in the scriptures the bible says then moses said go pick out a lamb a little young goat for each of your families and slaughter the little passover animal and then take a bundle of hyssop branches and dip it into that blood and then i want you to brush it across the tops and the sides of your door frames of your houses for the bible says for the lord will pass through the land to strike down the egyptians but when he sees the blood that blood on the door frames he will not permit that death angel to enter your house and to strike you down so now everyone i'm gonna need your help okay and we can all do this together can you all grab that paint brush you can all grab that paintbrush and let's dip it into that blood mix it up real nice and let's paint that door frame up and down up and down and get it ready because shortly after the bible says that moses had announced to pharaoh this this is what the lord says at midnight tonight i will pass through the land of egypt and all the firstborn sons will die in every family in egypt from the oldest son of pharaoh who sits on that throne to the oldest son of the lowliest servant girl who grinds the flower even the firstborns of all the animals will die and then a loud whale will arise throughout the land of egypt no my son he's dead the death angel came upon egypt because of pharaoh's stubbornness that is why it's good to listen to the word of god and always heed to his word and his message that's been brought for you little ones the lamb's blood on the doorpost that represented the blood of jesus christ for us it was a token it was a sign of his protection and god protected the israelites back then from all the plagues but right now god is protecting us through jesus christ the blood was a sign on the door that the death angel you're not welcome in my house but the blood of jesus on my heart is telling the devil devil you're not welcome here you're not welcome in my home sin you're not welcome here you're not welcome in my life so if you'd all please stand with me if you want to apply the blood of jesus to your heart please stand raise your hands and let us pray lord heavenly father oh we thank you lord jesus for that precious blood that you shed on calvary lord for father even before the manifestation of the existence of our lord and savior jesus christ upon this earth you gave us the examples throughout your holy bible lord that one day your lamb would die on that cross for our sins and today with these little ones they want to give their heart to you father
