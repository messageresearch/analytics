this morning likewise we thank every single one of you for being come here to honor the resurrection of the lord jesus christ and you know just like in you go to baseball games or basketball games football games you know that there's people there that might have differences there's some that voted for the democrats democrats regardless of what we believe in independence we're cheering for the lord jesus christ so that's how we why we're here this morning we all were in the same garment we might that's so let's give a high five to one another spiritually amen we we thank our pastor for allowing us to be here for always giving us a trust to speak the word his word is the power of authority matthew 8 verse 5. and when jesus entered in capernaum there came into him a centurion beseeching him and saying lord my servant lieth at home sick of palsy grievously tormented and jesus says unto him i will come and heal him centurion answer said lord i'm not worthy that thou should has come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed for i'm a man under authority having soldiers under me and i say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he do with it ibn and when jesus heard it he marveled and he said unto them that followed verily i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel jesus and i say unto you that many shall come from the east and the west and shall sit down with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven jose the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into utter darkness and there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth mas lucijos del reynolds jesus said unto the centurion go thy way and thou has believed so it be done unto thee and his servant was healed the same selfsame hour and father we come unto you lord this morning lord father celestial in estonia lord telling you lord opening our hearts to you really and truly no words to say to your people father but may you fill in the blanks lord but lord may you give the words this morning lord may you help your people or to recognize and hear the word this is a very special time a special part of the service is to hear your words [Music] lord may you anoint every single one of us we ask this in the name of jesus christ amen amen you may take your seats once again we thank you all for for being here this morning and uh we're thankful for the lord for the life that he has allowed us to have which you say speak the word when you tell people just speak the word but we want to do we want to dissect that word what backs up the phrase speak the word maybe not of knowledge of words and and [Music] intellectual when brother branham you know he saw he went to these real big meetings uh i i forgive me i might not quote it correctly you saw the minister's group coming in his group will follow after the minister very fine educated people and here comes the other preacher with his people very rich and educated fine people okay and then brother brown saw the people that were that were sick illogic and that's what we're wanting is the lord to reveal us his word amen amen so here we find this man as a roman centurion romano knowing that the the romans didn't crucify jesus christ levites didn't crucify jesus christ the jews did not crucify jesus christ so this this this man is roman soldier approach the lord jesus christ amen so let's go to mark 1 21. here jesus is in the same city of capernaum and they went into capernaum on mark 1 21 in marcos and they went into capernaum and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught in capernaum amen i like how the bibles are flipping you know we don't have any more bibles now today yeah you know i must be blessed you just have ipads and tablets ipads but it's nice to hear that in the church amen verse 22. and [Music] how do you teach just by going to chalkboard and you start teaching someone the best teaching a message if i speak about a minister as a public servant but when i come down i don't want to pick up a chair i don't want to pick up a trash because i'm a minister but this is right here with what the lord jesus christ was teaching his disciples he was not only just preaching to them but he was showing him them a man with the unclean spirit and he cried out saying let us alone what do we have to do with thee uh and jesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace and come out of him now who was jesus speaking to our akin jesus speaking to the man brother brown gave us one one good golden nugget he says love the sinner sinners sometimes we get that mixed up yeah this is uh we hate the sinner okay it wasn't the man he was talking to the spirit and jesus rebuked them 26 and when the unclean spirit had torn him and cried out with the loud voice he came out of him but when you speak god's word you don't have to repeat it to the demon twice or three times once is enough when you tell them get out of there get out get it come out get out of there again one time once is enough when brother brandon will come in the prayer line brown condor you hardly really will shout in the prayer line because he knew who he was when sometimes when when when you scream and you shout it out sometimes you're insecure lost and when they were all amazed and so much that they questioned amongst themselves saying what thing is this what new doctrine is this quest for with authority commanded he even the unclean spirits and they do obey him amen amen let's read what the brother bram says now see the roman recognized that jesus of nazareth had the authority over sickness [Music] all right he knew that jesus had that much authority and more over sickness but i know what authority is but yo you just speak the word my servant will live speak the word here's a very key thing here what brother branham says the roman soldier i know what authority is what is the word no comes from the word knowledge knowledge is facts information uh information skills acquired by a person through experience abilities and if i tell someone under me go and he has to go in again this is how authority works i hope you're following me he was under authority your dad taught you or your excuse me because your dad or your mom no it has to be something personal one-on-one this man was under authority he do he was uh he probably started his ranks started cleaning the restrooms he says so forth picking up the trash started to yeah how to be under authority and matthew matthew this is on matthew 8 but in matthew 9 jesus was going to go heading to heal jairus daughter uh jesus jairus came on to him and said lord my my my daughter she's she's dead uh she's sick um i need you to come and lay hands on my daughter and as jesus was heading towards towards that house jesus there was that woman who had the blood issue who struggled with for 12 years so jesus was heading to heal jairus's daughter jesus but along the way there was another woman who had another issue and her revelation so i don't need to touch him i just need to touch his clothing i just need to touch a little part of his clothing and i know i will be healed the third one said i need you to come to my house and lay hands so as he was heading there the woman had the faith her revelation i need is according to your revelation this is a revelation jairus was a jew jairo era this roman was a gentile estee romano i'm just i hope you're following me especially i don't have this quote up here but i want you just to follow me did you notice when he was going to pray for jairus daughter to be raised and she shall live in pontos he had been taught of laying of hands no i don't have i don't think i have that quote up there but i would just just notice what i'm about to say here el fuego power and authority it's according to what you believe is conformed both both of their faith was in christ i have this quote up here in the slides here um you know jairus said come and lay hands on my little girl and she will live the roman said i'm not worthy that you come under my roof why why did the romans say that porque es que el romano di hueson this is a gentile porque elera gentile we were not we were not we had no part of this because he's under me and i say to this one you do so and he does it because he has to obey me he's under me what was the roman doing what was the roman doing he was recognizing the supreme deity of jesus christ what a revelation by a question they had a whole loaf of bread and they rejected the bread but when us the gentiles we were satisfied with just the crumbs and this roman soldier was recognizing the supreme deity of jesus christ wow what that that's awesome right there now there's a lot of golden nuggets i just hope you you get them well i don't need you to come to my house because i'm not worthy for you to come enter my house i don't have i'm not worthy i have you the gentiles were not worthy of him the jews were his chosen people so see who gives revelation and revelation do i just open it up and i just grab it no god gives a revelation oh man i hope i hope you i really hope you really get it now if i if i'm outside and sometimes i see trash on the floor yeah this is your will one walks by it you know one what revelations are we asking the lord to give us a lord show me the mysteries of the seven seals mysterious is what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with god justice god just doesn't care about me whatsoever it's not important he gives you the cross that you can carry 15. for he saith to moses i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy and i will have compassion on who i will have compassion so then it is not him that willeth nor of him that runeth but of god that show with mercy i really really wanted to i really want to learn to run as hard as i can you don't work for this you don't work for it it's god have i it wasn't the other pharaoh who raised pharaoh that knows about egypt and with moses and pharaoh therefore he has mercy on him who will have mercy entonces and whom he will harden us piece of cake uh banco meal you could have made moses ferro el podo a certain pharaoh said all right here we go but god has a certain way protest he would have made it that easy no one would have known the power that god has done that's why there's a sick person so there can be he was recognizing the supreme deity of jesus christ and these jews didn't know who he was yes i thought he this is the supreme deity of jesus christ it is a supreme deity of jesus christ you must know who he is when you hear the voice ain't that good how you must know who he is i still have a texas area code area i don't have 602048 and i call the brother or so forth oh brother forgive me i didn't know it was you brother luis it was a texas area code but if you if you saw the error code 600 somebody from somebody here from you know he's the only one here with a 936 area so here is the same thing with jesus christ do we have to have that revelation of the deity of jesus christ the beginning and the [Music] he wasn't just a man he was receiving that revelation amen i hope you're writing this down because we're going to talk about that just a bit especially now just a little comment before we read again this morning we take in the supreme deity of the revelation of jesus christ who god revealed him revealed him to us this morning as a supreme deity the great i am the grand joe nor not i was or will be jesus christ what's the first thing he reveals himself here as well the god of heaven not a triune god but one god [Applause] and he reveals himself that way in the first of revelations and he speaks it four times in the first chapter before the so the first revelation we shouldn't be looking for some great mysteries he goes in faith and faith glory and glory gloria and gloria you get that sounds just like him when you recognize the scriptures and he reveals himself to you he takes the blind off your eyes he takes the earplugs out of your ears solomon through the edges when you know who he is you know his voice and when another uncertain sound comes i have the contact might not be there christ will never contradict his word uh i hope i hope the lord is revealing you the scriptures revelations 1 1 apocalypse he says what is the what is the revelation of the revelation of jesus christ the revelation of jesus christ which god gave on to him so god gave it to him you can grab it you can throw it away you could do whatever you want with it the revelation that i should be seeking of course is the word the supreme deity of jesus christ then you start adding to your revelations what revelation should i be seeking you know what revelation god forgave me i'm a little mischievous but i say with a true honest heart the revelation of loving the amar my wife amie do you know your wife's favorite restaurant restaurant one one brother you know what her favorite food is does the wife know their husband's revelation of what their favorite food are casual see he taught them remember jesus christ taught the the disciples he didn't teach them you taught him how to have authority how can i the key to cast out a spirit this element is perfect love perfect it's perfect love cast out spirits when like i said you can grab it you can throw it away this is my revelation that's why brother abraham says i love that song that says down from his glory because i love it because it speaks about his deity he speaks about who he is it speaks about that he was a god coming to become man he wasn't just a prophet [Music] he was more than a man he was more than a prophet that you know that every other voice i'm the lord jesus christ el senor jesus christ bow down before me and worship me and you lord you know what john luther did yeah excuse me what uh uh john martin did uh juan martin you know what he did he says i rebuke you satan because you're not him because he's not crowned yet we're going to crown him you have to have that revelation of who he is because it says they would deceive the very elected if it was possible john martin said he says you're not even him when jesus heard it he marveled jesus he's talking about the roman centurion romano he said i have verily until you have not found so great faith not in israel and i say unto you that many shall come from the east and the west and shall sit down with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven what is verse 11 speaking about el basicolons you speak about the gentiles habla de los gentiles and on verse 12. it is about the children of the kingdom [Music] shall be cast out into outer darkness there shall darkness they went through the time they went through a time of weeping and not we like wailing and gnashing of teeth they so you and i can have a space to repent but they were never cast out of the mind of god brother at the end time it's about the us the gentiles los gentiles they were blinded so we can have an opportunity to notice who joseph was next you know he became the right hand of pharaoh every knee was to bow down when joseph came in and joseph was the perfect type of jesus christ and when joseph was rejected by his brethren he was given a gentile wife that natural typifies the spirituals joseph was a type of christ he came for the jews the jews rejected him when jacob was blessing them remember jacob joseph had his children and it says jacob was blessing them ephraim was one onside on one side and manasseh on the other emanate he crossed his hands and he gave the younger child the blessing and jacob himself you put your right hand on the blessing on the young child it should have gone to the older one jacob said i know my hands are crossed your second is that's why he couldn't find a place to repent through the he a little after those quotes right there on paragraph 2 240. this is when jesus christ comes to christ he says arizona the desert arizona el decierto we will blossom the cactuses there's gonna be trees just read what the tape says but they're on the first hill says george joseph comes he says the desert is going to blossom hallelujah man see the jews had the right to become the bride because we recognize the supreme deity of jesus christ jesus christ they were all amazing so much at the question among themselves saying what thing is this what new doctrine is this for with authority command that he even the unclean spirits and they do obey him so when we tell the demon or an unkind spirit you have no authority i'm going to ask you two questions it's a rhetorical question so don't just think about it what gives the demon authority and when does that demon not have authority i'm going to pick your brain a little bit well yeah um how many are ready to receive the revelation of the lord how many know that the church is a hospital hospital it's people that are sick people that are hurt people that are damaged when a member makes a mistake have a hearing with one another that's what the scripture says yeah there it is if a member makes a mistake don't turn them down help him raise before we can go before god we got to go before that person we hurt what the prem says i had to do that yo i lied your mentee man i caused my wife to lie you can say amen to the word notice this is this is the prophet william branham william brown i had to do that i know i did wrong i lied this is your mentee and i caused my wife to lie i i believe i've told you about it here at the church it was a few days not long ago yes it's been about six weeks ago the attorneys had me so tore up over this investigation so i hardly knew where i was at investigation i had just got to go home from the office to eat dinner and then the private phone number rang and mera went to answer the phone number she put her hand over it and said my head feels like it's drawing off i'm losing my mind everyone has pressure but we have to let go of that pressure let it go let the pressure go i jumped up and i said tell them i'm not here she's very conscious of those things i know how i wasn't in here right then she said but you was here when he made the call that afternoon i went to pray for a sick baby and before i left the house the phone rang again and little joseph run over took the phone telephone said you want me to tell them you're not here you see how sin corrupts what a family would that finally be uh excuse me and little joseph run over took hold of the phone and said daddy jose tomorrow john the first chapter in the 21st verse then we have confidence in god for our hearts condemn us when i started to lay hands on it economy if brother branham wasn't fit to pray for that baby if he had to be clean i need to be clean when i lay my hands on someone who needs to be prayed for it i turn away from the man i said sir just wait here i got something something to make right i went up to the office and called him i said look sir i told the lion ladies i had my wife live i hope you get in the revelation of this of things she said i wasn't there and i ran out behind the house and i confessed it i told him about it he put his hands on my shoulder and he said brother branham el pose i've always have confidence in you but i got more than ever now a man he said that's willing to make his make right his wrongs a man that is willing to make right his wrongs i told them and i said i started to pray for a baby and the lord would just condemn me for it in my heart because i knew and if so then the spirit has all of the authority if not and the person has done all the requirements then that spirit has no authority is it the minister that's praying are we fit to pray for someone if our heart condemns us then we have confidence with god jesus said i taught them how to have authority jesus how to cast these unclean spirits out i'm done you can please stand yeah here there's roman soldier yeah that jesus christ had authority to cast out an evil spirit but here i find two powers one why does he stand by this element the reason in romans 8 17 18. there's a process the existing process faith and faith glory and glory of faith glory and glory to the child he was about to be adopted he had to be tutored he had had to get a report the two died report to the father he had to be interested in the father's business then he was heir to that throw to that business he said this is my beloved son here he him because whatever he says is as good as i say yes because i find them trustworthy i'm a clean man i find and if yeah faith and faith defense glory and glory and glory and glory man i i really hope you get it if so that we suffer with him i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared a lot of the evangelists they say well when he was crucified i was crucified crucified when he raised i was raised [Music] [Music] the reason for this is that character is simply never made without suffering la razon is because anybody can say do this do this do this do this do that character el character is a victory it's a victoria not a gift on a man without character [Music] everything is aligned today [Music] [Music] and the little temporary suffering that we go through now it's not worth it to be compared to the tremendous glory that would be revealed in us when he comes gloria oh what treasures are laid up for those questions who are willing to enter in his kingdom [Music] [Music] heavenly father we don't need you lord to come and lay hands on us lord that's why faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of god is there any sick amongst us in the name of jesus christ amen hello [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm [Music] [Applause] [Music]
