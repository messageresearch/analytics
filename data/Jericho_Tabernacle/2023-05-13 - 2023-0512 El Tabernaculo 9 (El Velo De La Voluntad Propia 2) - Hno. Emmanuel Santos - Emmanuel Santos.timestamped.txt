[28:19] myself
[28:21] [Music]
[28:49] Heavenly Father
[28:53] we come before you Lord this evening
[28:57] because father you're the author of this
[29:00] Bible
[29:02] you know the beginning and the end and
[29:06] Lord who better to go but on to you
[29:11] so we ask of your help Lord
[29:16] we asked you we open up our
[29:18] understanding
[29:21] and help us to open up our hearts
[29:24] and opening our hearts
[29:27] you are in charge of the rest
[29:32] of your help tonight
[29:41] we ask for this Lord
[29:45] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[29:47] amen amen
[29:51] just like we're standing I like to read
[29:54] two portions of the Bible is
[29:58] the first one is in Hebrews 10 19 to
[30:02] verse 22.
[30:17] the word says
[30:24] having therefore Brethren boldness to
[30:27] enter in the holiest by the blood of
[30:28] Jesus
[30:29] foreign
[31:46] but their minds were blinded for until
[31:48] this day remaineth the same Veil untaken
[31:51] away in the reading of the Old Testament
[31:52] which veil has done away in Christ
[32:00] but even on to this day when Moses has
[32:03] read the veil is upon their heart
[32:08] nevertheless when shall turn to the Lord
[32:09] the veil shall be taken away
[32:13] the blessings of the Ring of his word
[32:15] you may take your seats
[32:43] it's over their heart
[32:46] are those differences classes available
[32:47] there's two types of elves
[32:51] the veil that is inside of you
[32:54] that's all over your heart
[32:59] but the RAM says Revelations chapter
[33:02] four part two
[33:04] paragraph 266. This is
[33:08] how how do we get into this
[33:12] and I remember there was a veil
[33:15] a though that hangs
[33:18] between the holy and the holies of holy
[33:22] Christ
[33:25] and the holies of Holy Spirit Christ
[33:27] comes to sit down on your heart's Throne
[33:29] Cristo centrona Christ is in Thrones
[33:32] who enters
[33:55] the veil is called self-will
[34:21] and the only and only way that you can
[34:23] get in there is is to have
[34:27] self-willos you can see there's two
[34:29] types of veils
[34:32] we understand that in the old old times
[34:37] there was a tabernacle that was made
[34:42] that was divided
[34:45] from the outer courts to the outside
[35:24] and the second is the one that's upon
[35:26] your heart
[35:29] we know that Jesus himself is he is our
[35:33] example Jesus mismo Jesus himself
[35:37] he went through all these different
[35:39] stages
[35:41] that was in the Tabernacle una Fuente
[35:45] there was a fountain
[35:47] they will go and they'll be watched
[35:50] Jesus went to the Jordan River and was
[35:53] washed
[35:54] there was a bronze uh altar of made a
[35:57] bronze
[35:59] where the sacrifice was killed Jesus
[36:01] Christ
[36:02] Jesus was our sacrifice
[36:08] all these different uh things that were
[36:11] inside Jesus
[36:13] Jesus fulfilled each and every single
[36:16] one of them
[36:17] concerning the bells Jesus
[36:20] Jesus also fulfilled with the veil this
[36:23] is
[36:45] it is the flesh
[36:53] before he was arrested
[36:57] when he was praying
[37:01] the father let them I will be done
[37:05] but let thy will be done
[37:08] every human being
[37:12] has their own human self-will
[37:16] had their own will in the flesh
[37:49] but he surrendered his own human will
[38:05] he surrendered his body
[38:09] the Christian does the same thing
[38:12] you surrender your will
[38:15] you surrender your God your heart to God
[38:18] and then you surrender your body and
[38:21] then you serve God
[38:25] both veils have to be open adios unto
[38:29] God
[38:30] muchos God has a lot of problems
[38:35] with those who just opened the wealth
[38:38] that's on the outside
[38:40] those are the ones who come to church
[38:42] and they serve God
[38:44] or they just come to church
[38:48] but they don't allow for God to come
[38:51] inside their heart
[38:54] God needs for both of the veils
[38:57] to be open to him Jesus
[39:00] Jesus did the same thing
[39:03] Jesus surrendered his own human will
[39:07] and he surrendered his body
[39:11] and that is represented when he was on
[39:14] the cross
[39:16] and he said he cried in a loud voice and
[39:21] when he died
[39:22] and he surrendered his Spirit
[39:26] the scripture says the veil was ran in
[39:29] two in the temple most
[39:42] and surrendering into the will of God
[39:45] Jesus
[39:47] Jesus himself went to that
[39:50] and you yourself have to go through that
[39:54] you have to surrender your inner Veil
[39:58] you have to open up your heart
[40:02] and then you have to open up the will
[40:04] the veil of your flesh
[40:06] you will serve God
[40:11] aura personal
[40:14] and when a person has not been born
[40:17] again
[40:21] they're very similar
[40:23] we're going to demonstrate them here in
[40:25] the Bible in excellence in Exodus 26 1
[40:33] remember the Tabernacle that Moses did
[40:35] reflect it reflects a human body
[40:40] or reflects a human being
[40:44] we just finished saying that both fails
[40:48] the outer and the inner reflection
[40:51] similarities they are similar
[40:55] Antonio's in the Tabernacles are also
[40:58] similar in Mexico
[41:13] moreover thou shall make the Tabernacle
[41:15] with ten curtains of fine twine linen
[41:18] and blue and purple and Scarlet with
[41:19] cherubins of cunning work shall thou
[41:21] make them
[41:23] now that's the outer Veil
[41:26] you can see the materials that contain
[41:31] now the Intervale in excellence
[41:35] Exodus 26 31 is
[41:38] made of the same
[41:40] materials
[41:46] and thou shall make available blue and
[41:49] purple and Scarlet scarlet and fine
[41:51] twinlin of cunning work with cherubins
[41:53] shall it be made
[41:56] you can see that the both veils
[41:59] are similar
[42:02] your own veils of your body
[42:06] and it's upon your
[42:08] are very similar
[42:12] on the outside foreign
[42:24] says it represents cardinal
[42:28] S
[42:30] as you can see that your cardinal
[42:33] s by your body
[42:37] when a person has not been born again
[42:41] they're carnal in their heart
[42:45] but when a person has been born again
[42:48] that veil has been ripped
[42:52] Jesus has entered inside the heart
[42:55] and inside their heart is no longer the
[42:58] Cardinal
[42:59] is specifically but Jesus was born
[43:02] specifically in El Corazon was born in
[43:05] the heart not in the flesh
[43:38] it was like a baby that was in a womb of
[43:40] the mother
[43:41] it was in a real close world
[43:45] but when the baby is born
[43:48] was born in a new world
[43:53] and that never wants to return back to
[43:55] that old world
[43:57] it's like being born in a new body
[44:01] and dances
[44:05] so then one day you will be born
[44:08] with a new body
[44:10] but for now
[44:13] but you only be born new in your heart
[44:18] Jesus manifested Holy Spirit
[44:21] only in your heart
[44:24] that's why your body that's why you
[44:26] struggle with your body
[44:28] sometimes one doesn't want to come to
[44:30] church
[44:31] sometimes one gets mad well this is
[44:35] sometimes we have bad thoughts
[44:43] made that aspect of your flesh or the
[44:45] Bella that's on the outside
[44:48] to be subject to the word of God
[44:57] there's two portions where your cardinal
[45:41] that flesh
[45:49] there's two different Grace
[45:53] that's why it's so important
[45:57] decision that if you make your own
[46:00] decisions
[46:04] you voluntarily have to decide if I
[46:06] accept or reject Christ
[46:10] because that Veil is called a veil of
[46:13] self-will
[46:15] doesn't matter if your mother your
[46:17] father
[46:19] I dragged you to come to church
[46:22] and you didn't want to come today
[46:26] because you found out that brother
[46:27] Emmanuel was going to preach
[46:30] I said I don't like when he preaches
[46:51] through that Veil that's on the outside
[46:53] foreign
[47:23] he surrendered his body
[47:33] but the first one that you have to open
[47:35] is the bill Within
[47:39] if you open up the veil that's within
[47:43] um
[47:44] foreign
[48:09] faith
[49:01] and this is the faith that overcomes the
[49:04] world
[49:05] foreign
[49:58] and revive that seed that's within me
[50:07] God
[50:11] will not just force himself in
[50:15] you have to open up to him
[50:28] the first one was the fine linen in
[50:31] Apocalypse
[50:32] in Revelations 19 8 says
[50:43] de los Santos it says and for her and to
[50:46] her was drenna that she would be arrayed
[50:47] and fine linen clean and white for the
[50:49] fine linen is a righteousness of saints
[50:52] the Bible itself says
[50:55] that our works
[50:58] filthy rags unto God
[51:05] the fine linen is the righteousness of
[51:07] the Saints
[51:09] because when you open up to God
[51:13] you allow the Holy Spirit to come within
[51:15] you
[51:18] and you allow the Holy Spirit to work
[51:20] through you
[51:31] through you
[51:46] this great Forerunner has gone before us
[51:49] making a way
[51:51] he become from a spirit
[51:54] the great Fountains of the rainbow of
[51:56] God
[51:58] who had no beginning or or
[52:01] endos he was forever God is
[52:05] this ray of light went forth Amor it was
[52:09] a ray of love
[52:10] that's the main one red
[52:14] the next color that follows which was
[52:16] blue blue the trueness
[52:20] so the the current had the color blue
[52:24] so that represents the truth or trueness
[52:28] the baptism of the holy spirit this is
[52:35] says and then with the first great
[52:36] spirit of God which is love
[52:38] God like the great rainbows
[52:42] we couldn't imagine what he looks like
[52:44] but
[52:47] just say that he looks like a rainbow I
[52:49] can use espiritus them Spirits
[52:52] the perfect Spirit of perfect Spirit of
[52:55] Love Rojo
[52:57] redo Perfecto the perfect Spirit of
[53:03] fellowships
[53:08] they're saying I want to have a real
[53:10] true fellowship with you
[53:13] The Color Purple
[53:42] he was taken out into a public place
[53:50] and there he was robed with on a robe
[53:53] perhaps purple or some color of royalty
[53:56] so the color purple representative
[53:59] represents royalty and You by opening up
[54:04] you buy predestinations
[54:23] through you
[54:27] are Sons and Daughters of the king
[54:46] the soldiers started a crown of thorns
[54:49] and put on his head and they put on him
[54:51] a purple
[54:54] robeos
[54:56] and said hell King of the Jews and they
[54:59] smart him with their hands
[55:01] Jesus so they're making fun of Jesus
[55:06] dressing them as normally as a king
[55:08] would
[55:09] representative because purple represents
[55:12] royalty
[55:13] no that's in John
[55:16] when he speaks about this
[55:20] but in Matthew chapter 27 verse 28-29 it
[55:25] speaks about the same thing is
[55:32] and they stripped him and put on him
[55:45] and when they had planted a crown of
[55:47] thorns and they put it upon his head and
[55:49] a reed in his right hand and they bowed
[55:51] the knee before him and mocked them
[55:52] saying Hell the king of the Jews in Juan
[55:55] John this is
[55:57] the the road was called the color of
[56:00] purple in Mateo and Matthew
[56:04] he said the color was Scarlet which is
[56:14] it's the Scarlet or color red in English
[56:18] in English it says
[56:22] in Spanish says red
[56:32] also speaks about it also represents
[56:34] Redemption
[56:36] and the water separation
[56:42] I always think that the color red is
[56:44] danger
[56:46] the red does signify danger or alive
[56:56] but right in the scripture signifies
[56:58] Redemption through the
[57:01] bloodhub
[57:06] where she put the Scarlet strict down
[57:08] all through the Bible the Scarlet streak
[57:11] Redemption comes to read
[57:15] through the shedding of the blood
[57:20] and without the shading of blood there's
[57:22] no remission of sin
[57:27] and how the guy said go get this heifer
[57:29] that's read all over
[57:32] not one spot of anything else but
[57:35] perfectly
[57:39] for God look through red use
[57:45] what color red is when looking through
[57:48] red
[57:50] through red makes white intent try it
[57:53] one time
[57:55] Blanco red through red produces white
[58:02] so when God looks through the blood of
[58:04] Jesus Christ to we who are scarlet
[58:07] redo is
[58:14] he sees as white as snow expectations
[58:18] though your sins may be read like
[58:21] Crimson
[58:22] they shall be white like snow no
[58:46] remember it says the angel destruction
[58:48] was going to destroy that city
[58:51] is
[58:54] given the instructions to put that
[58:56] Scarlet streak yes
[58:58] and that was going to save her
[59:01] when the angel was to see it
[59:07] he will see the red sins of everyone
[59:10] and Rahab also had her since
[59:15] but she applied that Scarlet streak is
[59:19] Blanco and red through red is white
[59:23] so all the city of Jericho was
[59:28] was found it was white
[1:00:19] yourself to be sinful
[1:00:31] and you surrender to the will of God
[1:00:35] is
[1:00:49] always protected the way to the throne
[1:00:51] of God
[1:00:53] or to the tree of life
[1:00:55] so whatever God is there's life
[1:01:03] and to the Bible you can always see that
[1:01:05] he's on his throne
[1:01:09] so when you return back to your Bible in
[1:01:13] Hennessy you can read in Genesis
[1:01:24] there was a tree that was found by the
[1:01:26] tree by the name of tree of life
[1:01:28] but when they were cast out
[1:01:32] the Bible said there were Germans that
[1:01:34] were placed there
[1:01:36] they will guard the path to the tree of
[1:01:38] life
[1:01:40] is a tree of life representative
[1:01:42] represents
[1:01:44] eternal life
[1:01:51] eternal life
[1:02:16] [Music]
[1:02:31] no longer hindering you from coming to
[1:02:33] Christ
[1:02:35] but it's showing you the path to come to
[1:02:38] God
[1:02:40] but you have to open up yourself first
[1:02:43] if you don't open up
[1:02:46] the turbine won't allow you to come to
[1:02:49] God
[1:02:50] because one cannot live eternally
[1:02:54] with a sinful nature
[1:02:58] that's why Adam and Eve were cast out
[1:03:02] because
[1:03:08] with that sinful nature
[1:03:17] they didn't want sin to come to the
[1:03:19] presence of God
[1:03:20] but
[1:03:22] when the blood was shed
[1:03:25] and open up the way
[1:03:28] the blood covers you
[1:03:31] it covers your your red sins
[1:03:35] now the cheruband says that you're white
[1:03:38] and then he says come in now you can
[1:03:41] pass
[1:03:49] or apply to you
[1:03:53] it was not just a beautiful design
[1:03:57] it speaks about the things that you have
[1:03:59] to go through
[1:04:01] it speaks about the benefits that you
[1:04:03] will receive
[1:04:05] when you surrender to God
[1:04:14] that you yourself have to make
[1:04:17] from the heart
[1:04:20] is
[1:04:22] there's people that make decisions out
[1:04:24] of emotions
[1:04:26] the emotions have contact with this body
[1:04:41] by having faith in Jesus Christ
[1:04:46] that's very important
[1:04:49] if you don't open up correctly
[1:04:52] you yourself are blocking yourself
[1:04:55] to get to God's Throne
[1:05:01] the holy spirit is found there is
[1:05:12] if you if you were to be dead
[1:05:16] if you were to enter the presence of
[1:05:18] that eternal life is
[1:05:22] that thing that was there will return
[1:05:24] back to life
[1:05:26] foreign
[1:06:22] your body
[1:06:25] there's people that only Just Surrender
[1:06:27] their body
[1:06:29] coming to church week by week
[1:06:32] they hear the sermon
[1:06:35] but they never surrender the heart
[1:06:39] surrender the heart
[1:06:42] the the inside cannot open up is
[1:06:59] then he surrendered his human body
[1:07:07] personas the chirp is that allow for the
[1:07:10] people
[1:07:12] to get on to the to arrive to the
[1:07:15] presence of God
[1:07:16] physically yes and spiritually
[1:07:31] [Music]
[1:07:32] God dwells in heaven
[1:07:35] the Bible itself says
[1:07:39] that God has extended the heavens like
[1:07:43] curtains
[1:07:56] [Music]
[1:08:40] and it says my mom is waiting for you
[1:08:42] over there
[1:08:50] but
[1:08:54] here you do
[1:09:07] or the different dimensions
[1:09:11] or in different Heavens as the Bible
[1:09:13] says
[1:09:20] so before the blood of Jesus Christ was
[1:09:22] said
[1:09:24] no one can Ascend to Heaven foreign
[1:09:33] blocking the entry
[1:09:37] not allowing anyone to enter with a
[1:09:39] sinful body
[1:09:41] but when Jesus shed his blood
[1:09:44] you can read in your Bible
[1:09:47] Matthew 27 verse 49. this is
[1:09:59] many of the saints that have slept
[1:10:21] the path was not open yet to heaven
[1:10:45] lifted up
[1:10:51] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:10:53] perish but have eternal life
[1:11:01] for God so love the world that he gave
[1:11:04] his only begotten son that whosoever
[1:11:05] believeth in him shall not perish but
[1:11:07] have everlasting life
[1:11:09] so we spoke about the cherubin
[1:11:12] we spoke about the sacrifice of the
[1:11:14] blood
[1:11:16] we spoke about the veil of the human
[1:11:19] flesh
[1:11:22] and the benefits of one when one opens
[1:11:25] up the veil application if you apply
[1:11:28] that is
[1:11:29] so these verses that we just finished
[1:11:31] reading
[1:11:33] you can see that verse 13 is
[1:11:38] a turban that blocks the person from
[1:11:40] coming to the presence of God
[1:11:43] no man has ascended up to heaven
[1:11:50] it speaks about the serpent that was
[1:11:52] placed in the wilderness
[1:11:53] and Jesus Christ foreign
[1:12:20] if we accept
[1:12:55] in verse 16 it says
[1:13:05] for God so loved the world that he gave
[1:13:07] his only begotten son that whosoever
[1:13:09] believeth in him shall not perish but
[1:13:10] have everlasting life
[1:13:13] if you open up your Veil it's in your
[1:13:17] heart
[1:13:19] you allow that eternal light is
[1:13:32] it gives you eternal life
[1:13:39] three
[1:13:46] speak about the same bill that's on the
[1:13:49] outside
[1:13:51] we just finished speaking about the
[1:13:53] materials
[1:13:56] but here is talking about the
[1:13:58] measurements
[1:14:00] here in verse two this is
[1:14:10] the length of one curtain shall be eight
[1:14:13] and 20 cubits and the breadth of one
[1:14:15] curtain four qubits and every one of the
[1:14:18] currents shall have one measure
[1:14:20] so it was 20 by four uh 28.
[1:14:35] it represents the cycle that the woman
[1:14:38] goes through
[1:14:40] oriente
[1:15:40] now there was three Hebrew children in
[1:15:42] the fiery furnace
[1:15:45] but the fourth one comes it was
[1:15:49] Deliverance
[1:15:52] Lazarus was the grave three days
[1:15:55] but when the fourth one came
[1:15:58] he was delivered
[1:16:01] four is God's number of Deliverance
[1:16:05] Anton says
[1:16:14] that Tabernacle represents the life
[1:16:17] and the Deliverance that he wants to
[1:16:19] give you
[1:16:24] an excellent stress in Exodus 26 3
[1:16:29] .
[1:16:30] remember the veil that's on the outside
[1:16:32] foreign
[1:16:39] represents the cardinal
[1:16:41] s
[1:16:43] but obviously one does not want to be
[1:16:46] Cardinals
[1:16:47] one wants to open up so God can come in
[1:16:51] so by opening up
[1:16:56] it was separately made itself two fives
[1:17:00] number five
[1:17:03] La Gracia it's Grace gracias there's two
[1:17:06] Grace
[1:17:08] the first Grace is the grace of
[1:17:10] Salvation
[1:17:12] and the second race is Rapture in Grace
[1:17:28] so God give me of your grace
[1:17:31] by closing yourself to God
[1:17:34] you reject God's grace
[1:17:37] you come back to number 10.
[1:17:39] to your carnal nature but
[1:17:42] by opening up to God
[1:17:45] but you surrender to the God's grace
[1:17:57] and the message a paradox
[1:18:00] ES
[1:18:05] Joshua Hears A book actually
[1:18:08] it's a book of redemption the Old
[1:18:11] Testament
[1:18:14] Josh so we have to consider to be that
[1:18:16] the book of redemption
[1:18:19] because Redemption has two parts
[1:18:23] Redemption anywhere has two parts
[1:18:27] that is
[1:18:31] it takes two parts to make redemptions
[1:18:40] Saving Grace
[1:18:48] they will take you out of this world
[1:18:54] that's why it's so important
[1:18:57] that you don't maintain yourself being
[1:19:00] carnal
[1:19:02] if you make a mistake that's fine
[1:19:06] there's still blood
[1:19:33] and God's grace returns back to you
[1:19:43] you
[1:19:48] surrender so the power of Grace
[1:19:51] can work in your life
[1:19:55] yourself
[1:20:08] gracias so there's two Graces
[1:20:15] that's why the scripture says one the
[1:20:17] author
[1:20:18] and the consumer of the faith is the
[1:20:22] Alpha and the Omega recipient beginning
[1:20:24] in the end the Bible says
[1:20:28] his brother had the Assurance
[1:20:32] he that started the good work within you
[1:20:36] well take it into the day of Jesus
[1:20:38] Christ
[1:20:47] and the headstone
[1:20:52] and to show you is Zechariah 4 7 this is
[1:21:06] a great Mountain before the rebel thou
[1:21:08] shall become a plane and it shall bring
[1:21:10] forth The Headstone there thereof with
[1:21:12] shoutings crying Grace Grace onto it
[1:21:16] the stone as it says in English
[1:21:18] it's the headstone
[1:21:37] as you receive to Grace
[1:21:43] now at my last
[1:21:47] ISO
[1:22:05] and they also make the loops of blue
[1:22:07] upon the edge of one curtain from the
[1:22:09] slavage into the coupling and likewise
[1:22:11] thou shall make the outermost edge of
[1:22:13] the another curtain in the coupling of
[1:22:15] the second this is
[1:22:30] shout out make in the edge of the
[1:22:32] curtain that is the coupling of the
[1:22:33] second that the loops may take hold one
[1:22:36] of another means
[1:22:43] 50 textures of gold and couple the
[1:22:47] currents together with attaches and it
[1:22:49] shall be one Tabernacle this is
[1:22:53] I even have an image if you can show it
[1:23:04] it says what the Bible says 50 Loops
[1:23:11] even the same curtain that's back here
[1:23:14] when it's opened up
[1:23:16] and the edge of every curtains
[1:23:19] and we have 50 Loops
[1:23:22] is
[1:23:27] when they'll close it again
[1:23:54] together with attaches and it should be
[1:23:56] one Tabernacle it says one Tabernacle
[1:23:59] there's only one God
[1:24:04] even though they open up
[1:24:07] and they manifest whatever's on the
[1:24:10] inside
[1:24:11] it shows all the different portions
[1:24:14] so once again when it closes
[1:24:17] it shows that it's one Tabernacle one
[1:24:21] God
[1:24:22] Persona and also speaks about one person
[1:24:30] there were 50 loops
[1:24:33] recorded remember when it was opened up
[1:24:36] it was five and five
[1:24:39] there's two redemptions there's two
[1:24:42] portions
[1:24:45] the Bible there's two fifties
[1:24:54] speaks about the number 50. this is
[1:25:00] now in the Old Testament the Bible says
[1:25:02] that there was a to be 50-year Jubilee
[1:25:06] that was seven times seven years
[1:25:11] it was to be made ready
[1:25:16] in the 50th year was the Jubilee here
[1:25:20] 50 means Jubilee cincuenta is
[1:25:23] 50 50 is God's Jubilee number
[1:25:27] significance the word Pentecost means
[1:25:30] 50. foreign
[1:25:37] of the Holy Spirit at the end of the 50
[1:25:39] days it was also the end of the 50th
[1:25:41] year Jesus
[1:25:45] Jesus come to foreshadow or to form
[1:25:47] forewarn rather the people
[1:25:51] coming of the Year of Jubilee
[1:25:56] he went into the synagogue of Capernaum
[1:25:59] and sat down
[1:26:02] and taking the scripture turnover in
[1:26:04] Isaiah 61 1. and read the scripture
[1:26:09] the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[1:26:11] foreign
[1:26:53] everyone that was slaves to sin and
[1:26:55] bound
[1:27:35] year came
[1:27:39] every person will hear the trumpet
[1:27:42] and then they will make their decision
[1:27:45] is
[1:27:50] what happened in the Old Testament is
[1:27:54] that the high priest will carry the
[1:27:56] blood
[1:27:57] sacrificial to offer as a sacrifice
[1:28:00] and if God accepted the sacrifice of the
[1:28:03] blood
[1:28:04] and after leaving the Tabernacle
[1:28:08] the trumpet was
[1:28:11] to announce to everyone
[1:28:16] they didn't see the sacrifice that was
[1:28:18] done but
[1:28:19] by hearing the trumpets
[1:28:22] they knew that the sacrifice was made
[1:28:40] that he died for us
[1:28:45] and by hearing it
[1:28:47] we make our decision
[1:28:53] Now The Marvelous thing is
[1:28:56] the trumpet that was used
[1:29:01] not the trumpet or the instrument that
[1:29:03] we use when we played we play the music
[1:29:06] the trumpet that was used
[1:29:26] it's the Horn of an animal
[1:29:29] and this is trumpet
[1:29:50] turn into a spiritual trumpet
[1:29:59] turn into a spiritual horn
[1:30:31] now the preaching is
[1:30:35] that is a sound that comes forth from
[1:30:37] the trumpet
[1:30:40] it's the instrument
[1:30:42] that's why who he that preaches is
[1:30:45] only an instrument
[1:30:50] but that breath that goes through the
[1:30:53] instrument
[1:30:55] that inspiration that goes through it
[1:30:57] comes from someone else
[1:31:01] decision
[1:32:15] it represents a kingdom
[1:32:29] the
[1:32:34] Kingdom of Heaven has drawn eye
[1:32:37] this is
[1:32:48] so them as being a horned a trumpet
[1:32:51] instrument an instrument
[1:32:53] the message came through from Jesus
[1:32:56] Christ
[1:32:57] but it came through with the disciples
[1:33:02] said that Jesus gave power onto his
[1:33:04] disciples
[1:33:06] to heal the sick
[1:33:09] to cleanse the leopards
[1:33:23] because
[1:33:27] we don't know anybody
[1:33:29] it's God that heals
[1:33:34] but how many times have you been here
[1:33:36] because someone prayed for you
[1:33:40] so can somebody pray somebody healed you
[1:33:43] know
[1:33:46] but God uses an instrument
[1:33:51] here we have a good example Brothers
[1:34:05] but what God has done through him
[1:34:10] he is
[1:34:15] part of that Kingdom
[1:34:18] it's not his kingdom
[1:34:20] is
[1:34:23] the power that counts for the kingdom of
[1:34:25] heaven
[1:34:26] but it goes through the horn instrument
[1:34:30] it goes through the instrument
[1:35:16] allows the world to seem very attractive
[1:35:22] you close yourself
[1:35:25] by rejecting the world
[1:35:28] you open up yourself to God
[1:35:31] remember there's another world
[1:35:33] do you want to go to that world
[1:35:36] yourself to this one yeah
[1:35:38] and open to the world of faith
[1:35:43] can produce a new or make a new world
[1:35:46] for you
[1:35:52] he will not force you
[1:35:55] understand
[1:36:05] so remember La clavis the key is
[1:36:10] to surrender the inner Veil
[1:36:16] surrendering the will that's in your
[1:36:17] heart how do you do it
[1:36:21] confessing everything to God
[1:36:24] it's a God I cannot go against this
[1:36:31] but these uh
[1:36:34] these bells of the flesh
[1:36:37] does not allow me
[1:36:39] I'm going to rip this Veil Lord
[1:36:43] and I'm going to by ripping it
[1:36:47] I'm saying come in
[1:36:49] with your life
[1:36:52] and manifest what's already in me
[1:37:27] is to surrender to you
[1:37:41] within us
[1:37:45] to keep that bill that's outside under
[1:37:49] subjection
[1:37:50] until the day cometh
[1:37:53] that we should be veil with a new body
[1:38:08] we confess our sins
[1:38:19] the name of Jesus Christ amen amen

[1:43:12] [Music]
[1:43:39] to be able to baptize my son-in-law
[1:43:44] he has made his decision
[1:43:49] adios
[1:43:53] he has come to show God that he has
[1:43:55] repented
[1:43:59] there's certain things that the human
[1:44:02] doesn't understand
[1:44:05] but only God knows
[1:44:08] when it's the time
[1:44:11] when the appropriate moment is
[1:44:17] as long as there's life then there's
[1:44:19] hope
[1:44:25] everyone that believes and is baptized
[1:44:27] shall be saved
[1:44:30] and he that believes not shall be damned
[1:44:39] on that day when they crucified Jesus on
[1:44:41] 238 and acts 2.
[1:44:44] [Music]
[1:44:45] they had already crucified him
[1:44:49] and hearing the preacher
[1:44:54] he said that it was a personal decision
[1:45:00] and Jesus made a personal decision
[1:45:02] between you and me well there is
[1:45:06] when he was up in Gethsemane Islam
[1:45:09] he was praying
[1:45:14] time had arrived
[1:45:19] he knew that it was time to die for the
[1:45:22] human race
[1:45:24] to pay the price for each and one of us
[1:45:28] so that we could have eternal life
[1:45:32] when he was praying
[1:45:36] he said these words senor said Lord
[1:45:41] if it's possible
[1:45:45] that this cup passed me by
[1:45:48] as a human being
[1:45:51] he didn't want to go through that
[1:45:57] but he said Lord let it be thy will be
[1:46:00] done
[1:46:02] for me and he decided to die for you and
[1:46:05] me
[1:46:07] not caring who we were
[1:46:11] not caring where we come from
[1:46:14] nor will we have done
[1:46:17] one thing that he did see
[1:46:21] it in you and me
[1:46:23] that being lost
[1:46:27] he knew that deep within our hearts that
[1:46:31] we loved him
[1:46:36] and it didn't matter to him what we had
[1:46:38] done
[1:46:42] even then he extended his hand and gave
[1:46:45] us Grace
[1:46:48] and in listening to the things that
[1:46:51] Peter was saying to the people
[1:46:55] I'm gonna read it
[1:46:59] it says in Acts 238
[1:47:03] but I will go up to verse 36. he says
[1:47:09] right
[1:47:17] foreign
[1:47:31] [Music]
[1:47:33] everybody had known what they had done
[1:47:37] and they were pricked in their hearts
[1:47:42] so then in hearing this
[1:47:47] now when they heard this they were
[1:47:48] pricked in their heart
[1:47:51] less
[1:47:53] Hermanos
[1:47:55] and sit under Peter and the rest of the
[1:47:56] Apostles men and brethren
[1:47:59] what shall we do
[1:48:03] listen and then Peter says
[1:48:06] unto them repent
[1:48:09] and be baptized every one of them
[1:48:11] in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:48:15] for the remission of sins
[1:48:19] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:48:21] Holy Ghost
[1:48:23] this is his word
[1:48:25] God does not change
[1:48:29] and this night I want to tell each and
[1:48:31] every one of you
[1:48:33] that if you would like to get baptized
[1:48:36] that the waters are open
[1:48:42] but I want you to know that he loves you
[1:48:44] and he forgives you
[1:48:48] and perhaps maybe I don't understand
[1:48:50] many things
[1:48:53] but it's not my will but it's his will
[1:48:57] your
[1:48:58] name I didn't die for anything
[1:49:00] he died for you and every one of us
[1:49:04] and that's his decision
[1:49:07] one decision for eternal life
[1:49:10] we're going to pray
[1:49:19] we're going to be praying for him
[1:49:22] and that the Lord May bless him and help
[1:49:24] him
[1:49:27] and then he may give him the guidance of
[1:49:31] his holy spirit
[1:49:35] that is the only thing that can control
[1:49:38] us
[1:49:39] the life isn't easy is
[1:49:46] we're full of mistakes and many other
[1:49:48] things
[1:49:51] by his Mercy
[1:49:56] that's why he paid the price we're going
[1:49:58] to be praying
[1:50:00] Heavenly Father
[1:50:03] creator of the heavens and the Earth
[1:50:07] you know our hearts
[1:50:11] and you know
[1:50:12] sometimes we don't understand the why
[1:50:17] but you know why
[1:50:23] you do things in different ways that we
[1:50:25] sometimes don't understand
[1:50:28] but we're here to fulfill your word Lord
[1:50:33] Carlos Gomez here we have Carlos Gomez
[1:50:37] I place them into your hands
[1:50:41] I ask that you bless them and you help
[1:50:43] him
[1:50:45] that you fill them with your Holy Spirit
[1:50:52] and that he may be able to guide his
[1:50:54] family as well
[1:50:57] Lord now I place them into your hands
[1:51:00] you were the one that started the story
[1:51:03] and you're the one that will finish it
[1:51:26] in all of his walks in the rest of the
[1:51:29] days of his life
