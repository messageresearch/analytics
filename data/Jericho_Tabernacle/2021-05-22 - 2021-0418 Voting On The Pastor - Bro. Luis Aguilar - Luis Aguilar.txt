before we before we begin brothers and comments let us pray let us bow our heads borrow hearts and let us unanimously lord knowing lord if one of these days if we don't repent lord if we die here on earth without and father even [Music] mientras as we're what we're about to speak here this morning father may you help us to be in one accord father if there's any spirit contrary to your word father we cast it out in the name of jesus christ we don't want to accept the word of a man we want to accept the word of god heavenly father we are ready for service father you know anoint your servant and your interpreter father may you anoint your members here at this church father amen amen and we can open up our scriptures in ephesians chapter 4. i kind of want to say something here before we begin we as sort of an apology i know some people might have disagreements and some might be in agreement but let us be in one accord here this morning we don't want to offend anybody we don't want to hurt anyone we're just trying to do the best that we can as humans and to do it the closest we can to the word of god amen amen ephesians the fourth chapter starting on the verse seven comenzano conversiculosiete but unto every one of us is giving grace according to the measure of the gift of christ wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captive captivity captive and gave gifts on to men now that he ascended what is excuse me now what that he ascended what is it but also he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he descended in the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things and he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers evangelists pastors for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in unity of faith and of the knowledge of the son of god onto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ affine de perfectionara los santos talking about the ministry of christ the ministry gifts of christ to his body ablando del ministerio de los dones de cristo al cuerpo and and once again it's to his body he says he gave every one of his uh everyone a gift according uh with measure everyone has a measurement it is a gift of christ he uh he gave some apostles some prophets and some evangelists some pastors and teachers pastors now there's a reason why he sent forth a five-fold ministry he didn't just send the fight forward ministry for the so that apostle no solomon or for the prophet or for the evangelist or for some pastors or teachers maestros to just to wear a nice suit and tie but there's a purpose why he sent the five-fold ministries and in verse 12 the pastor paul says it is for the perfecting the saints perfection for the perfecting of the saints for the edifying of the body of christ that's why that's why there's a fightful minister and we understand that that tapes are good antennae but we need the five-fold ministry but and i'm going to insert something right here what the bernie says and the message uh if i'm not mistaken the story of his life he said mexico mexico has found a six-fold ministry i'm going to let you meditate on that mexico has had a six-fold ministry mexico and control ministerial he said brother bernie said we would go to mexico vamos el trista the one who goes to go tour around the city to go for a vacation there's not a six-fold ministry no ayun sexto ministerio pastor paul says it is for the perfecting of the saints or the edifying of the body of christ till we all come into a unity and unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ we all have our disagreements we we might have all of our agreements but as brother brother branham says hermano brandon he said we can barely disagree with one another but we still shake each other's hands god bless you todd a man a man well brother i don't i don't believe he's coming in a cloud i don't believe he's coming in a horse we still believe that he's coming back amen amen there was there was a i'm going to go real fast we were in jeffersonville one time established almost in jeffersonville i'm stalling a little bit so i can feel the right time and i was in jeffersonville estaba in jeffersonville and the pastor told me to speak for 15 minutes there in the ohio river pastor in rio ohio on repentance we had some people come together and uh we had some baptisms and what happened once we were done some [Music] and suddenly this this this couple stopped me either he said what church do you go to oh yeah he said well i i come from texas this youth are from phoenix and we're visiting this church called branham tabernacle here on penn street estamos visitano que esta glacia is [Music] yeah that man that man over there that the dead and christ shall rise first i don't think he's the only one that's going to come back you and i have loved ones and i'm talking to the colored man this is the scripture is amen amen now this is let us go to first timothy chapter 3 verse 1 this is a true saying vigilant sober of good behavior sobrio prudente de coroso gave it to hospitality aptitude hospital given to wine no striker nope no guardian filth of the cree but patient but a but not a brawler not covetous no codicioso de ganancias de sonestas one that ruleth world his own house having his children its objection with all gravity go for if a man know not how to rule his own house how shall he take care of the church of god not a novice lest being lifted up with pride he followed the condemnation of the devil and moreover he must have a good report of them which are without unless he fall into the approach of the snare of the devil is necessary he's the right man always you should pray and seek god's favor you you who are you are such to select your pastor he says you should pray for god's favor you who are selecting your pastor intellectuals intellectuals you churches sometimes voting for your pastor justice iglesias you want your pastor you try to find some great intellectual guy intellectual so you can say to your neighbor over here you see this you know what he's got this guy's got best location our pastor has a college education universitaria see you see we ben nosotros you ustedes you'll pick a man like that ustedes you'll pick a man like that if i want a man to teach my children to leave them under his tutor and things like that and my brother and my mother and someone that i'm expecting to meet over there on the other land the algebras i'd rather have a man that didn't know his abcs if i want a man to teach my children and to leave him under his tutor and things like that and my brother and my mother and someone that i'm expecting to meet over in the other land i rather have a man that didn't brother branham is saying i'd rather have a man that doesn't know anything in an intellectual standpoint how many believe this is a sovereign church this is a sovereign church it's official it's official as long as the church iglesia in our church is the sovereignty of the church the church moves or puts in the trustees the church moves the church moves the pastures that's the way it was did in the bible time therefore we feel that no one person is a dictator or something in the church we don't want that no what did brother brian say katy put him on a branch we don't want that no every man every person got a persona myself yo mismo and voting anyone botando and just got one vote solo tengo un boto just like any other person in the church here personally brother neville thinks this man would be a right man or the trustee board thinks this this man would be a right man it has to be the church one more time it's the sovereignty and the law of the church by the word of god before they just can't say that i think this man will be a right man no one that's the minister that's the trustee that's the elder el minister from the biggest to the smallest no one does anything in himself is the vote of the church it's a sovereign church and this church is sovereign there ain't no board of trustees or deacons going to tell you what to do there's no board of trustees or deacons going to tell you what to do and there's two or three people getting something against the pastor they can't raise up with their deacons and trustees if he's the assistant pastor he's got one vote he's just like the lane member como los lycos that sits back there yeah he just got one vote that's all if he's the assistant pastor he's just got one vote he's just like the lame member that sits back there esc the whole vote of the church settles the matter el boto de la iglesia a regla that's put a deacon board out on pastor the church does that la iglesia in a general vote of the whole thing it's sovereign in itself amen amen he's the bishop the general overseer you all voted a hundred percent on it so we held right up to that entonces the church is sovereign what the church says local and we like that because we have no bishops hierarchies here or overseers supervisors or so forth to tell us tell us this or that or the other so how do we know if god how does one know the rightful position in the body of christ that's a good one at the moment very good muy buena how does that be kind of a question amongst us many of us here tonight how do you rightfully no como los aves now i'm presuming that this brother wants to know what position what in christ what part of christ do i play position now for instance i like to say this for example brother to give you the best answer i know hermano your position in christ revealed to you by the holy spirit and then if you want to know whether it's the holy spirit or not find out whether he blesses what you're doing or not and if you want to know whether it's the holy spirit or not find out whether he blesses you what you're doing and if he blesses it then that's him and if he doesn't bless that's a pause and i'm not adding but i believe brother graham is saying that's not god so always do this brethren whenever you feel that you're supposed to do a thing first find out if it's scriptural for for for you to do it if it's in the scriptures not just wrote right in one place no but i mean completely scriptural through the bible for you to do it your position to position say say if you be an evangelist the grammar sustainability of the nine spiritual gifts in the church and the four spiritual offices of the church any position first see if it's a first see if god called that they're professing see god will work with this creature the way he's made him so i i watch him says yolo mirror if you see him real flighty and going on silver fribolo and he says the lord called me for so at such to be a pastor senor yamado para talcosaur if you see real flighty and going on he says the lord called me for so as such to be a pastor now a pastor can't be a flighty person a pastor solid and sound um see ben god called me to be a teacher and watch a teacher he gets all mixed up and everything else then you can tell but the thing to do your position is is usually known whether you can do it or not your position is usually known you can do it or not now staying at home here would just be and there's no one there's none of them left here tonight i wanted and there's no one there's none of them here left tonight that they cried and went out there on 1717 spring street spring and the lady mrs hawkins over here hawkins met me instead crying during the time of depression one in the neighborhood will cook a mess of beans and we'll come and eat from that she said i'll allowance my children at the table if you can only build a tabernacle and my calling was an evangelist laying right here at this cornerstone acosta if we could burst in here tonight you'll see a fly leaf of my bible here us where he told me to be an evangelist and i wasn't a successful pastor enough because i haven't got the patience what it takes to be a pastor so therefore if i try to if i try to pasture i would just be as far out as a pastor trying to be an evangelist see what i mean you can see the way the lord calls you what your position is in the body we read quotes about praying over the decision we read codes of the sovereign church and we just read the quotes of knowing the position of our body in christ god honor this man i know it is the choice lord as a sovereign church is this portion of this service in a special way in what righteous and holy name of jesus jesus now with our heads bowed not only with our heads but our hearts no solos and as every member of this church that comes here regularly and supports it with your tithe and offerings which is considered a member of this church while the pastor and i mean along looks the associate pastor uh solo aqui pastor associates i will ask if the church finds brother taylor to be a just man and eligible hermano taylor said by the best of your thinking over this group of people you will signify the same by raising your hand significa now if there is any contrary will you raise your hand before is the same caliber of a pastor [Music] so what happens when we vote the majority vote wins [Music] so what is what if it's uh 50 with 51. the majority vote wins that's what the prophet told us if one of that one act that one voted for no no if that one voted for yes it's yes someone says everything is we're reading the codes for brother branham everyone has their ideas i understand everyone has their thoughts we're trying to do our best to rely on ourselves what the prophet of god says then i come down and i felt the feeling of the church entonces and felt the feeling of the church de la iglesia that the church in the majority iglesias seemed to want it this is brother brandon then what did i do anton says what did i do okay if the church wanted it what did i do can you say yo i sacrificed my own thoughts yo sacrifice if the church wanted it i'd be like i sacrificed my thoughts your sacrifice and i throw it in with the church sure let's do it again that's the way we cast lots that's the way was in the bible time cisco fuels the impossibility the way the church voted the sovereignty of the groups of people they come together in unity there are strengths in unity certainly if that's what the church wants sierra mentions if that is god is wanting he's got more authority to vote among the whole group of people than he has to me that should be the motive of every christian wow wow that ain't clear i'm sorry i'm behind it you do all that i votes for him that is what we stand for if there is a more clear brothers si no es mas laro que sormanos if you want to see that brother luis is lying with them you're going to offend me then say for instance we want to change something in the church well then if the trustees wants to and that somebody else wants to bueno persona the deacons they want to change something that comes before the church seems to be a little different than what the whole church said let's sacrifice that idea sacrifice idea if my idea see me there is different as different from all of yours i don't care who i am important you preach really good brothers and if our idea here seems to be a little different what the whole church is let's sacrifice that idea because that's the only way we can stand united is [Music] we'll just go on on your way going now is if this church will just go on the way you're going nowhere if the church continues the way we're going united together it's eliminated what god would do if we stick together and then so complete in the hands of god amen amen i suggest brother neville to be pastor of the church as long as as long as the church suggests them being pastored as long as he holds the post of duty and stays with the faith wants to come and feels the leading of the lord then the leading of the lord will the leading of the lord for him to stay direction then the leading of the lord for him to stay direction what is the leading of the lord for him to stay direction if the congregation votes the same sila congregation amen amen we read quotes of praying over the decision that this is a sovereign church how to know the position on the body of christian this is the church of god it is the way we conduct ourselves in here are like christians i don't think we could be any more clearer and i believe that that is truly from the lord your we gave we gave the announcement last week that everyone had had the week to pray what was going to happen [Music] we're only asking them to to vote solos this is a serious matter and if if only put this in the hands of the lord if the you know up trust in the lord solo ponies last week we informed you that we have selected a candidate for the position of pastor pasada a candidate is a person who applies for a job or is nominated for elections a person taking examination a person or thing regarded as suitable for or likely to receive a particular fate we have selected this man because we believe that he is the right man for the position man can think whatever he wants but it is what god wants through his people man can think whatever he wants it is what god wants through his people we have given you the name of the candidate we gave his name because you're members of this church who have the right to know the way we'll be deciding this is according to them before we do this we're going to count the votes of the deacons and the sound systems we're going to count their votes first once we cast wins once we get their votes then we'll proceed with the church amen amen everybody has one vote you go for yes you can't vote for no no no that's two years you only have one vote amen amen amen brothers if uh let us let us pray before we begin and uh to proceed with this and put ourselves in the hands of the lord and says we needed your guidance lord senor your father as we begin to make a great decision or may you help us father lord let us not look at man may you guide us

commentarios i'm not a sure not even anywhere close to my brother or pastor brother johnny uh you know when we bought it for brother johnny it was a lot easier we were all here because of him but the lord had a change of heart maybe not a change of heart but a change of plan and he threw us all a curve and we we had to we had to stand at the crossroads and go forward but i do have some some comments i'd like to go over with you pero si tengo nos comentarios lo cual es quieres espressados i'll try not to take so long and it's been quite a long day already a real long week there's three things three things you might uh have questions about uh my experience my experience my plans for the future miss planet i'll try and go over them really fast as mentioned last week how i spoke last year i'm not someone that was born in the message or from a religious family i don't have a name like others do not i am the only one in my sight of the family who has received this precious message of grace only one thing i can tell you is i love the lord and have tried to serve him in every job post i have been placed i have been pl uh blessed to have a career that has allowed me to attend almost every service and to be in every in my post of duty the type of work i have done the last 22 years it allowed me to work every day or any day i wanted but i decided to follow jesus and the message of the hour first i have tried to be as honest as i could in the work that i do i have worked with some of you guys please talk to me and tell me what i have done my life has revolved around the service of the lord and by doing so i have served the lord's bride the message teaches us to serve where you are needed and to be faithful faithful faithful to your post of duty if [Music] you may say i haven't heard him preach i wasn't asked to preach i have served in other positions in el paso tabernacle i was asked to preach and song need in spanish tabernacle you might remember i am not very good at it but i was obedient to my pastor damien pastor the last three months i only spoke once you might ask why because if i would have spoken and take in the pulpit i would have been accused of taking advantage of the situation my friends when i speak i want to repeat what our prophet spoke and be a vessel that the lord can use to re reach each one of you what really matters is how well you encourage lead and by example and serve the members of what we did when our pastor brother johnny was called by the lord is to encourage our young ministers with the help of our elders we asked them to preach and preach the best they could predict because we were at a crossroads we told them we were expecting only the best from them and we were going to use them in every opportunity we could and we expected them to do their best to serve the members of our church who are asked to keep the flock together and take them to the master junto the lord jesus christ and every member is important i have also asked the deacons to be at their post of duty and to be ready to preach if called i have not asked for more than what i have already done and am doing no pedigree i have several messages i can speak from the basic basic messages to the token which is one of my favorite messages then but you see it's not about me it's about you how can the ministry better serve you peruse but if you don't have anyone to preach to who will believe you i am asking you to have faith and follow jesus christ we have a tremendous we have a tremendous evangelist tremendous teacher we have a we have a

pray for our ministry including the music department including the department of music sunday school teachers department department our objective is to serve the bride of the lord jesus christ let's unite around the world and get ourselves ready it is to our benefit to go forward we must go forward necessity pray for each of our mentioned departments in our church pray for each person who by god's grace stands before this pulpit and brings you the word to have them help with counseling and send them out to wherever we feel led to send them to preach the gospel they can be a great inspiration to other churches we need to fellowship with other churches we want our children to accept the lord jesus christ we need to have some good dedicated classrooms for our children we need to
