[23:07] but we keep fuers we keep the strength
[23:10] and energy
[23:13] to come and present him a worship to our
[23:18] Lord
[23:23] with our presence here
[23:27] let's go to the word of God
[23:33] I begin with a quote of brother Branham
[23:38] entitled The unchanging God
[23:41] um
[23:43] uh March of 1960. Jesus Jesus said
[23:50] the word of God says the word of God is
[23:53] like an unto a man who sown a seed
[24:16] that's in the seed
[24:55] like it was in the beginning
[24:57] and
[25:00] on to the person that it was given to
[25:21] because that comes from eternity
[25:25] in the beginning
[25:32] a story of redemption
[25:35] we have come
[25:38] when the times have gone
[25:40] [Music]
[25:42] and the things have moved
[25:46] somewhere there's something that does
[25:48] not move
[25:49] that is our God
[25:53] he does not change
[25:57] and what he has established it
[26:02] cannot stop being
[26:04] he has enough power
[26:07] sufficient
[26:10] he has enough creativity
[26:13] to make a go local
[26:15] of what he has made it to be in the
[26:19] beginning
[26:22] we know that there were two trees
[26:26] the tree of knowledge
[26:29] and the Tree of Life
[26:32] and Eden there were okay
[26:37] came from a seed a
[26:41] they'll be it's
[26:43] and it was ordained for us to live by
[26:46] this from that tree Jesus Christ
[26:55] stops eating from that tree
[26:58] he enters into time
[27:02] and enters into a corruptable stage
[27:05] and here's where we're at now
[27:09] may the Lord bless us
[27:12] so cuando
[27:16] El Senor when the Lord when he knew that
[27:21] this was going to happen
[27:23] he prepared everything
[27:26] [Music]
[27:27] the messenger tells us
[27:30] God's purpose
[27:33] can never be defeated
[27:35] and there's something
[27:38] for the children of God
[27:40] is going to keep them
[27:43] always going forward
[27:47] that we cannot even be defeated
[27:51] and that's called Revelation amen amen
[27:56] where no matter
[27:58] ah
[28:00] a Pedro to Peter
[28:03] the Lord told them
[28:05] blessed art thou is for no for no one to
[28:10] do this flesh or blood he's angry nor
[28:12] neither flesh nor better but my Father
[28:15] which is in heaven
[28:18] Thou Art Peter he
[28:21] and
[28:38] do we identify with those blessed
[28:48] tells us in a message
[28:55] in the message the great warrior David
[28:59] paragraph 49 in Spanish
[29:02] just hear very well

[29:58] itself before you

[30:10] like saw
[30:12] no not right
[30:23] it fell in the ears of a good of a right
[30:25] young man
[30:27] this young man
[30:31] and this way
[30:36] it has been revealed and he was the son
[30:40] of God
[30:44] and he had an anointment
[30:46] since when
[30:49] that's the key since when
[31:13] that does not change
[31:20] I
[31:22] like to think
[31:27] the prophet circular

[31:56] and it comes with a great anointment but
[32:00] uh
[32:01] estimular to simulate
[32:04] to stimulate what okay those hearts
[32:12] before the foundation of the world
[32:16] that were associated with
[32:19] Islam
[32:21] because they were believing genuine
[32:25] of the
[32:27] word of God that is Incorruptible in
[32:32] which
[32:35] to be given to light given the light
[32:40] I find

[40:52] what that is
[40:58] to you by revelation of God
[41:01] and then conference
[41:06] you act accordingly as a Believer I
[41:11] added that
[41:17] here we see plenty that God is revealed
[41:20] in Jesus is
[41:32] be sure to read that scripture Saint
[41:34] John uh
[41:38] can come unto me except
[41:41] my father draws him first yes
[41:47] and all that the father has given me
[41:51] they will come to me
[41:54] they will come
[42:14] when did he give it to him
[42:18] before the foundation of the world
[42:24] how many are those are here foreign
[42:37] that's the only lineage
[42:44] in paragraph 124 in Spanish
[42:51] just a little bit before that sir
[42:55] no man can do that Persona not a person
[42:59] doesn't matter if it's good doesn't
[43:02] matter who you are
[43:04] it has to be revealed
[43:07] and know who Jesus is
[43:12] in Plainview
[43:15] just as others
[43:18] the word of God is a seed
[43:21] that's precious here it is
[43:41] we could do a great harvest
[43:44] a great harvest a hundred percent
[43:52] our pastor would say
[44:02] just to see the stock coming up
[44:08] leaves coming out
[44:12] just to see the shock coming out
[44:17] we want the grain
[44:22] now is the time
[44:25] amen amen lamies
[44:31] the the the harvest is ready
[44:37] to sing laborers onto the Harvest
[44:40] there's no labor there's no harvesting
[44:43] there's no Harvest then there's no bread
[44:46] there's no bread then there's no life
[44:51] we need that
[44:56] of
[45:01] the Original Seed
[45:03] is
[45:04] that's where the children may the Lord
[45:09] have every Church of the message
[45:24] to eat
[45:27] they don't give him the bread
[45:29] then they're going to find somewhere
[45:31] else
[45:32] but we are responsible to give them
[45:35] something to eat
[45:37] [Music]
[45:39] of the original a bread of life he said
[45:44] yes
[45:47] that has descended from Heaven
[45:51] may the Lord bless us
[45:58] the the ground prepared beforehand
[46:02] if you sold the seed simply and you just
[46:06] throw it out to the out there on the
[46:08] ground
[46:09] it will do no good
[46:11] the birds will pick it up
[46:15] if you throw it among thrifts this was
[46:18] the Thorns
[46:19] it'll choke it out pretty soon
[46:23] Jesus parable
[46:25] so then
[46:28] the ground has to be made ready first
[46:32] the natural typifies the spirit so then
[46:37] in his Sovereign Grace
[46:39] Sovereign Grace
[46:45] prepares the heart first
[46:47] he prepared you
[46:51] before the foundation of the world to
[46:54] receive him
[46:55] in this age
[46:57] he foreknew you
[46:59] but before
[47:03] knowledge
[47:05] ordain you to eternal life
[47:09] he knew you
[47:11] therefore he prepared you
[47:16] that's the reason you staggered
[47:19] and you staggered
[47:23] but you you're here where you are now
[47:25] it was God
[47:28] leading you to the place
[47:31] where he had foreign
[47:50] that you have there he left a million
[47:54] for you you can occupy
[47:57] good people
[47:59] no malientes not
[48:04] not bad people
[48:06] people
[48:12] the people who are right
[48:16] but they didn't have something that's
[48:18] something that you do have
[48:20] predestination
[48:22] A Heart That was predestinated
[48:25] you're able to receive him to receive
[48:28] what to receive the message of the hour
[48:38] may the Lord bless you brethren
[48:43] it's a love story
[48:46] the prophet tells us
[48:52] what was first
[48:55] or faith faith
[48:59] in the answers
[49:03] because with
[49:12] eternal love
[49:15] it's great
[49:18] great
[49:27] being reborn
[49:31] of Incorruptible seed
[49:37] less
[49:40] the scripture says to go where we're at
[49:43] now
[49:45] that
[49:47] our great great grandfather
[49:50] which is Abraham
[49:53] is
[49:56] he also your great great grandfather
[50:01] he is my great great great grandpa okay
[50:05] because I'm the Seed of Abraham
[50:20] in the dictionary to find that
[50:26] but we are the children of abrahamas
[50:30] through an Incorruptible seat
[50:34] the seed of the word
[51:02] [Applause]
[51:06] and he wrote
[51:09] a registry
[51:26] there
[51:28] you can find me yeah
[51:35] but my second register
[51:39] of my new birth
[51:42] it's not written here it's written up
[51:45] there
[52:01] in the book
[52:04] of the heavens
[52:18] unto Abraham was the promise and onto a
[52:22] seed
[52:23] s he does not say seeds as of many
[52:30] he's not talking of the natural seeds
[52:35] he says unto thy see
[52:38] which is Christ
[52:47] that was found in Galatians 3 verse 16.
[52:55] when Saint Paul preaches us to the
[52:58] Galatians
[53:01] you can remember that the Galatians
[53:06] of their primitive way of believing isao
[53:09] Paulo and Saint Paul
[53:13] comes and he corrects them
[53:19] they started in the spirit and they're
[53:21] going into the first you're going
[53:24] backwards
[53:25] asike
[53:26] so then
[53:30] stress and verse 24 of the third chapter
[53:34] of Galatians decent it says
[53:37] where for the law
[53:41] was our Schoolmaster it was our school
[53:48] there's only a school a teacher only to
[53:52] take care of us to bring us to the
[53:56] genuine things to me to that lie
[54:00] eternal life that light that goes in the
[54:04] circle
[54:05] to Christ
[54:11] that we might be justified by Foreign
[54:13] anymore
[54:29] [Music]
[54:31] by faith in Christ Jesus
[54:35] Christ for as many of you has been
[54:37] baptized
[54:39] have put on Christ
[54:41] there is either Jewish
[54:47] there's no mail nor female
[54:53] Jesus in Christ Jesus
[54:56] Christ
[55:00] then ye or Abraham
[55:03] and heirs according to the promise
[55:09] brother
[55:13] this is something to start dancing The
[55:17] Heirs
[55:21] I would be just content that my father
[55:24] my parents would have just left me
[55:28] a building
[55:30] and leave me a ranch
[55:35] say
[55:36] mansion
[55:41] but this inheritance
[55:46] for the children of Abraham
[55:53] may the Lord bless us
[55:58] Abraham Busco he looked for a city
[56:04] and Builder is God
[56:08] a city with Foundation con fundamentos
[56:12] with a Vine Foundation

[56:43] s
[56:46] here in in finishing
[56:49] he
[56:52] um
[56:58] the message communion friction 65
[57:04] in Spanish
[57:08] in paragraph
[57:11] 43.45 and 46.
[57:18] the first book of life appearing
[57:50] which you have asked yourself
[57:54] where did this come from
[57:57] what are these strange things
[58:03] but it happens on to us
[58:26] he'll go and take that example
[58:38] they're in the field
[58:41] a strange egg
[58:45] an occasion
[58:48] is
[58:50] studying a bit
[58:52] in North America you have the Eagles
[58:55] here in North America
[59:03] there is an ego that represents the
[59:06] United States as the bald eagle
[59:07] Americana the American Eagle
[59:11] that's a species uh
[59:17] when it brings forth eggs
[59:21] it's not a chicken
[59:24] it doesn't put it every once in a while
[59:27] and when it puts when it lays it it's
[59:30] common but he lays only one muchos he
[59:34] doesn't the eagle doesn't Place many
[59:36] eggs
[59:43] I don't know if anybody has know that
[59:45] but I know a little bit of it but
[59:47] I called my attention
[59:50] that the real ego is because there is a
[59:53] real eagle
[59:56] and that egg
[1:00:04] in a shell
[1:00:05] s
[1:00:09] this have these little portions in the
[1:00:12] Shell okay

[1:00:16] says
[1:00:20] they come out a bit
[1:00:23] with a bit spots
[1:00:26] when I read that oh Senor I said Lord
[1:00:32] I mean
[1:00:39] the real Seed of Abraham
[1:00:41] a man a man Jesus christovino Jesus
[1:00:45] Christ came in
[1:00:48] and it's Sanctified so for us
[1:00:55] to come forward
[1:00:57] like the seed oh that's incorruptible
[1:01:02] it's so low
[1:01:04] commentary that's only our comments
[1:01:08] let's see what the messenger says
[1:01:12] what are those strange things
[1:01:39] that was somebody different
[1:01:47] you know who the branhams were
[1:01:52] um
[1:01:57] because of the last name
[1:02:00] because he says
[1:02:05] because I was born the Charles is I was
[1:02:10] born by Charles and Ella Branham
[1:02:12] and then by their nature
[1:02:15] I am a sinner the world would say
[1:02:20] speaking lines
[1:02:23] Psalm 51.
[1:02:27] and all those worldly habits that are
[1:02:29] within me
[1:02:30] foreign
[1:03:19] um
[1:03:20] everything that a sinner is
[1:03:23] I was I was raised
[1:03:26] but here in the Bible there was
[1:03:31] there was a small sign of life
[1:03:36] since always
[1:03:38] all the time it does not
[1:03:42] abandon us
[1:03:44] it cannot leave us
[1:03:47] that is that is the predestinian plan of
[1:03:51] God
[1:03:54] aura
[1:03:56] now
[1:03:58] El sitake
[1:04:03] that in his household
[1:04:06] Christian or anything else
[1:04:12] he speaks about his contact with nature
[1:04:14] in his story
[1:04:15] but it says but one day I said Senor I
[1:04:19] said Lord there's something here
[1:04:24] manifest yourself
[1:04:29] he took a step and he was born again and
[1:04:33] he was born again
[1:04:35] song
[1:04:38] our our lives are like that Lily
[1:04:42] and the message how can I overcome
[1:04:49] and paragraph 92 in Spanish
[1:04:52] I think the same in English
[1:04:56] says like I said in the beginning
[1:04:59] you are born defeated
[1:05:09] because you're born
[1:05:14] what a surprise to Satan
[1:05:18] that he was gonna come across some
[1:05:21] people
[1:05:22] friend they was going to confront
[1:05:24] himself just like David confronted
[1:05:27] Goliath
[1:05:32] you come to me this way
[1:05:36] of the Lord of hosts
[1:06:11] the armies of the Living God
[1:06:24] [Applause]
[1:06:28] may God help us
[1:06:31] I want to finish
[1:06:35] defeated

[1:06:54] defeated
[1:07:00] Victoria we gotta come to some real
[1:07:03] victories
[1:07:12] because my father that's my father's
[1:07:14] throne

[1:08:27] outside
[1:08:29] there he is displayed
[1:08:32] I believe
