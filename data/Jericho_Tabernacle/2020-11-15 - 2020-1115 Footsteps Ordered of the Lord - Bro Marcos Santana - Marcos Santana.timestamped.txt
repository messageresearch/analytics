[53:12] elizabeth the scripture tells us that he

[53:52] jesus christ
[54:08] as long as there's life in you

[54:14] is still wet on the cross

[1:11:42] and there was about 10 or 12 of us there
[1:11:48] in addition to her and her grandson
[1:11:51] and now the shack that she lives in
[1:11:55] is no more than six feet wide is known
[1:11:57] as the uh
[1:11:59] and maybe 12 to 15 feet long
[1:12:05] where somehow they managed to squeeze a
[1:12:07] tiny bed
[1:12:11] a really small couch
[1:12:15] and shelves all on all four walls
[1:12:17] stacked from the ground to the ceiling
[1:12:27] and now we would just see and think to
[1:12:29] ourselves
[1:12:32] how much she lacks how much she doesn't
[1:12:35] physically have on this earth
[1:12:40] where there she her daughter and her
[1:12:42] grandson live
[1:12:45] but yet she has a joy coming from within
[1:12:47] her that i've never seen before
[1:12:53] she starts testifying of the miracles
[1:12:55] that have taken place in her life
[1:12:59] and then she tells us he knows but today
[1:13:02] is a special day
[1:13:06] we are i am truly blessed
[1:13:10] angels from heaven have come to leave
[1:13:13] their footsteps in my home
[1:13:30] we offered to give her a hundred dollars
[1:13:32] in their currency
[1:13:37] that goes a long way in south africa
[1:13:41] and she wouldn't receive it she would
[1:13:44] reject it
[1:13:46] but instead she grabbed of her own food
[1:13:50] out of the poverty that she's in de la
[1:13:52] pubres
[1:13:54] and said no i want to bless you
[1:13:57] that you and your sister and your wife
[1:13:59] kenny
[1:14:00] hermano it was just such a beautiful
[1:14:03] testimony for us
[1:14:07] an experience in our lives
[1:14:10] and i'm happy and proud to know
[1:14:27] but i know how happy she was while being
[1:14:29] in this world
[1:14:34] and she's now even more happy where she
[1:14:36] finds herself today
[1:14:48] if you could turn to the book of psalms
[1:14:50] chapter 37
[1:14:56] we're going to read verse 23 and 24.
[1:15:08] psalms 37 23 reads
[1:15:12] almost 23
[1:15:15] the steps of a good man are ordered by
[1:15:17] the lord

[1:17:07] christ amen i'm in
[1:17:10] you may be seated
[1:17:14] uh to to give this message uh
[1:17:17] a title
[1:17:20] [Music]
[1:17:22] uh i would like to title it footsteps
[1:17:25] ordered of the lord los pasos ordenados
[1:17:30] and to give it a subtitle
[1:17:34] uh we're going to say desperation
[1:17:40] and and we'll see if we can get into
[1:17:42] that desperation
[1:17:47] and throughout the week i don't know why
[1:17:50] i
[1:17:50] kept being pulled back to the story of
[1:17:52] jonah
[1:17:55] regress and jonah is a very well-known
[1:17:59] story in the bible
[1:18:04] that's taught to us in the sunday
[1:18:06] schools
[1:18:09] that god came to this man named jonah
[1:18:11] okay
[1:18:14] and that jonah was given a commission by
[1:18:16] god
[1:18:20] or an order from god
[1:18:23] to go where the bible says to arise and
[1:18:25] to go on to nineveh
[1:18:29] the scriptures say cry out unto nineveh
[1:18:33] it was gold preached
[1:18:38] for their wickedness their sins are
[1:18:40] great
[1:18:43] and this man jonah yes like we know
[1:18:47] he didn't listen to the word of god
[1:18:51] he didn't listen to the commission that
[1:18:53] was sent to him
[1:18:56] instead of going out onto nineveh
[1:19:00] the bible says that he got on a boat and
[1:19:02] fled from the presence of the lord
[1:19:19] and storms and waves throughout the
[1:19:21] ocean
[1:19:24] so tremendous that it was at the point
[1:19:26] of breaking down that ship
[1:19:31] where all the sailors and even the
[1:19:33] shipmaster were scared and desperate and
[1:19:35] nervous
[1:19:40] brother branham says in the message
[1:19:42] behold a greater than solomon is here
[1:19:43] this element
[1:19:47] speaking about jonah
[1:20:02] well we know that all of them cried out
[1:20:06] that they was going to sink and that
[1:20:09] there was something wrong
[1:20:11] and jonah came up and then he confessed
[1:20:15] he confessed that this could be his
[1:20:17] fault
[1:20:20] he said to bind his feet in his hands
[1:20:24] and to throw him overboard because it
[1:20:27] wasn't right for all of them to perish
[1:20:29] because of him
[1:20:34] no no i find it so amazing
[1:20:37] that here jonah was fleeing away from
[1:20:39] the presence of god
[1:20:43] god sending him in one direction
[1:20:47] and him going backwards to another
[1:20:49] direction
[1:20:53] we could say in other words he was back
[1:20:54] sliding
[1:20:58] and and this wasn't just anyone this was
[1:21:00] what brother brown says was a prophet of
[1:21:01] god
[1:21:02] yes
[1:21:06] and in the book of jonah it says so they
[1:21:09] took up jonah
[1:21:11] they cast them forth into the sea
[1:21:13] illocharon
[1:21:14] and then the sea ceased from raging
[1:21:19] so after them sending him out
[1:21:23] the the skies got clear
[1:21:26] the
[1:21:40] these weren't believers of jehovah
[1:21:43] these weren't believers of the i am that
[1:21:45] i am
[1:21:48] because moments before moments
[1:21:52] the bible says that these mariners they
[1:21:55] were all afraid
[1:21:57] they were desperate they were scared
[1:22:01] and that every one of these men they
[1:22:04] cried out unto
[1:22:05] their god so these were believers of
[1:22:09] other gods strange gods
[1:22:13] and what a scene that god takes
[1:22:16] advantage of every single moment
[1:22:20] that through every single pair of eyes
[1:22:22] that was there on that ship
[1:22:27] they were able to see the power of that
[1:22:28] almighty god in action
[1:22:33] jonah didn't preach to these shipmates
[1:22:35] about repentance
[1:22:49] he taught every single man on that ship
[1:22:54] that there would that salvation requires
[1:22:56] a perfect sacrifice
[1:23:00] and that perfect sacrifice yes for
[1:23:04] everyone to be saved on that ship
[1:23:08] to not die on that sea but
[1:23:12] to not be destroyed by that storm
[1:23:16] was that it had to be jonah that was
[1:23:17] thrown off the ship
[1:23:21] they couldn't throw out the shipmaster
[1:23:25] they could have cast out their luggage
[1:23:27] to to make the ship lighter
[1:23:29] nope
[1:23:38] none of that was going to stop this
[1:23:39] storm
[1:23:42] jonah had the revelation that he needed
[1:23:44] to be thrown out
[1:23:51] for the safety and salvation of everyone
[1:23:53] on that ship
[1:23:57] and then what happens next the bible
[1:24:00] says
[1:24:02] that the men feared the lord exceedingly
[1:24:08] and they offered a sacrifice unto the
[1:24:10] lord and they made vows
[1:24:14] that once the
[1:24:28] and those men were now converted unto
[1:24:31] that true god
[1:24:35] they offered their own personal
[1:24:36] sacrifices
[1:24:38] sacrifices personally that sacrifice of
[1:24:40] repentance unto god
[1:24:44] and they made a personal vow with him
[1:24:48] brother branham says in the same message
[1:24:50] this is my brand name is mansaki and i
[1:24:52] always felt sorry for jonah
[1:24:55] because many people i think they
[1:24:57] misunderstood jonah
[1:24:58] muchos personas now they said jonah was
[1:25:02] backslidden
[1:25:05] and he was this and he was that and he
[1:25:07] was the other iq
[1:25:09] and i've said the same thing but let's
[1:25:13] just study jonah for a minute
[1:25:17] i don't believe that he was backslid
[1:25:20] because he was god's prophet
[1:25:24] and he seemed to be walking out of the
[1:25:26] will of god
[1:25:30] but the little story that i want to tell
[1:25:32] you in a moment
[1:25:36] i believe that you will all see
[1:25:52] and i tried my hardest to try and find
[1:25:54] it
[1:25:57] where brother branham was talking donde
[1:25:59] hable branham about that if we so much
[1:26:01] as doubted
[1:26:02] doubt our testimony
[1:26:06] testimony that we've already backslid
[1:26:09] just from simply doubting i just
[1:26:12] couldn't find it i wanted to read it
[1:26:14] this morning
[1:26:16] personally i struggled for years to
[1:26:18] believe my own testimony my own
[1:26:20] experience
[1:27:07] so in other words one is like a
[1:27:09] temporary action
[1:27:13] and then the other one is like a
[1:27:15] long-term or permanent condition
[1:27:21] or state of being jonah was not a
[1:27:25] backslider
[1:27:28] jonah had simply backslid
[1:27:53] you know the footsteps of the righteous
[1:27:55] or ordered of the lord
[1:28:26] now that doesn't take away from our own
[1:28:28] desperation
[1:28:31] jonah when he was awakened
[1:28:34] you can only imagine what he was seeing
[1:28:38] uh maybe like the titanic
[1:28:54] the storm about to destroy everyone in
[1:28:55] the boat
[1:28:59] but then desperation kicks in
[1:29:03] jonah knew he was fleeing from the
[1:29:04] presence of god
[1:29:08] he thought
[1:29:21] this wasn't some escape artist that
[1:29:23] could be thrown under water and escape
[1:29:30] this was real life for jonah
[1:29:34] brother says his hands were tied his
[1:29:36] feet were tied when he was thrown into
[1:29:37] the sea this is
[1:29:41] hopeless probably thinking this is it
[1:29:43] for me
[1:29:48] but brother branham says better this is
[1:29:50] but i'm going to try and take up for
[1:29:52] that preacher tonight
[1:29:56] and i'm going to say i believe he was a
[1:29:59] prophet
[1:30:02] and he was exactly in the will of god
[1:30:07] i believe he followed the leading of the
[1:30:09] spirit
[1:30:12] i believe he was led to go that way
[1:30:17] he didn't understand it after god had
[1:30:21] commissioned him
[1:30:22] in one place
[1:30:26] and then here he found himself going
[1:30:28] another way
[1:30:31] here jonah now being swallowed up by the
[1:30:33] whale
[1:30:36] may be thinking could this be my
[1:30:37] salvation
[1:30:40] or maybe this is the finale to my death
[1:30:42] okay
[1:30:44] i'm going to die here in the belly of
[1:30:46] this whale
[1:31:17] it says that it wasn't until after those
[1:31:19] three days and three nights
[1:31:24] that he finally started to pray unto god
[1:31:28] after those long three desperate days in
[1:31:31] the whale's belly
[1:31:36] where he saw that nothing and no one
[1:31:38] else can save him and help him
[1:31:40] donde miraculous
[1:31:47] bible says then jonah prayed unto the
[1:31:49] lord god
[1:31:53] to get him out of the fish's belly
[1:32:29] and i will pay that which i vow
[1:32:33] that salvation is of the lord
[1:32:36] and we know what happened next in the
[1:32:38] story of jonah
[1:32:42] he was spit up on the shores of nineveh
[1:32:46] he fulfilled what god wanted of him
[1:32:50] and those people repented and god saved
[1:32:52] that people
[1:32:56] but it took no it took jonah experience
[1:32:59] after experience for him to see the
[1:33:01] light
[1:33:06] not the experience of going from an
[1:33:08] unbeliever to a believer no experience
[1:33:13] but jonah was already a christian he was
[1:33:15] already a believer
[1:33:18] the issue was jonah had to wake up
[1:33:37] where he could finally reach out and
[1:33:38] grab that hand
[1:33:42] because jonah had heard the direct voice
[1:33:44] of god
[1:33:48] it wasn't enough for him jonah saw the
[1:33:51] powerful hand in the storm that was
[1:33:53] taking place
[1:33:57] but it wasn't enough for him jonah was
[1:34:00] saved and swallowed up by that whale
[1:34:13] but it wasn't until he found himself
[1:34:15] himself in that place of desperation
[1:34:21] where he had to choose between life or
[1:34:23] death
[1:34:27] isn't the message desperations this is
[1:34:30] when you pray for the baptism of the
[1:34:32] holy spirit
[1:34:36] the token don't say no diga
[1:34:39] well now i'll go up there and try and
[1:34:42] boy
[1:34:44] lord i'm just a little tired
[1:34:48] says oh mercy just stay in your seat
[1:34:53] then don't even make an attempt if you
[1:34:56] come
[1:34:57] vienna and you say i'll pass through the
[1:35:00] prayer line
[1:35:03] i'll put a little oil on my head
[1:35:06] i'll see if it does me any good but
[1:35:09] you might as well just set where you're
[1:35:11] at
[1:35:12] is
[1:35:22] that when he was a young man he had felt
[1:35:26] a pull in his life cynthia
[1:35:28] that drove him to that altar
[1:35:32] where he wanted to be prayed for don de
[1:35:34] queria
[1:35:35] and this brother he did get prayed for
[1:35:37] isis
[1:35:38] but nothing happened but
[1:35:49] maybe that holy spirit just touched him
[1:35:51] on the exterior
[1:35:58] but because of what had happened to him
[1:35:59] on that day
[1:36:02] he swore to himself
[1:36:06] that he would never again go up to the
[1:36:08] altar to be prayed for hamas
[1:36:12] unless almenos unless he
[1:36:15] knew that it was god being the one that
[1:36:17] was pulling him
[1:36:20] and now on one side
[1:37:04] such a simple but deep revelation
[1:37:09] how it is that man doesn't search for
[1:37:11] god
[1:37:13] it's god that searches for the man
[1:37:16] yet once he finds us
[1:37:20] and now we find ourselves seeking more
[1:37:22] and more of him
[1:37:25] but how it is that he hides himself in
[1:37:27] simplicity
[1:37:30] for us to want more and more and more of
[1:37:33] him
[1:37:36] and like i said this brother wasn't
[1:37:38] looking for god no more ecomodic
[1:37:41] he was fleeing just like jonah
[1:37:45] but the moment came in his life
[1:37:58] to open him up to the reality of life
[1:38:14] getting into that desperate state
[1:38:18] knowing that this is a matter of life or
[1:38:20] death
[1:38:24] and that desperation drove that brother
[1:38:43] branham says lisa amano branham until
[1:38:45] you get to that place
[1:38:49] until the whole church gets to a place
[1:38:54] that it's between death and life
[1:39:08] it takes desperation to bring god on the
[1:39:11] scene
[1:39:15] and so in looking at jonah miranda i i
[1:39:18] was pulled toward the life of peter
[1:39:22] pedro and peter is our precious brother
[1:39:23] in the faith
[1:39:40] and in the book of luke chapter 22.
[1:39:44] here was jesus jesus and he directed
[1:39:47] himself to peter
[1:39:49] pedro and he says behold it is
[1:39:52] satan has desired to have you
[1:39:55] satan but i have prayed for thee
[1:40:04] and when thou art converted
[1:40:12] so satan knew that peter was a very
[1:40:14] important piece in god's economy
[1:40:18] important peace in god's plan
[1:40:23] satan knows that each and every one of
[1:40:25] you are an important piece in god's plan
[1:40:30] that's why satan desires to have every
[1:40:33] one of your
[1:40:34] satanists
[1:40:48] that satan was desiring to take hold of
[1:40:50] peter
[1:40:53] pedro that's why jesus had already
[1:40:55] gotten into a deep prayer with god
[1:41:00] that when the great time of trial comes
[1:41:05] when that testing that pressure that
[1:41:07] desperation comes
[1:41:11] the scripture says faith
[1:41:14] fail thee and i try to put myself in
[1:41:18] those scriptures
[1:41:20] you should put yourself in those
[1:41:21] scriptures
[1:41:23] jesus was making an intercession for
[1:41:25] peter unto god
[1:41:29] to give him faith because he knew those
[1:41:31] dark times were coming
[1:41:36] but jesus did more than that for you and
[1:41:38] me
[1:41:41] for me he prayed unto the father for us
[1:41:43] to have faith
[1:42:11] we were inside of jesus
[1:42:15] jesus so that prayer for peter
[1:42:18] pedro that prayer was for me
[1:42:22] that prayer is for you i need that god
[1:42:25] sent faith
[1:42:41] and what blows my mind is at the end of
[1:42:44] verse 32
[1:42:47] the scripture says and when thou art
[1:42:50] converted
[1:42:53] then strengthened thy brethren confirmed
[1:43:00] but peter had already been given the
[1:43:02] keys to the kingdom
[1:43:05] peter was the one with the great
[1:43:08] revelations
[1:43:10] seems to me like peter was the man
[1:43:14] but the scriptures tell us that he
[1:43:15] wasn't even converted
[1:43:20] i've learned that there's a difference
[1:43:22] between being convinced
[1:43:24] and being converted
[1:43:30] and it takes me immediately to the words
[1:43:31] of paul immediately
[1:43:35] have you received the holy ghost since
[1:43:37] you believe
[1:43:41] jesus was here saying the same word
[1:43:43] saying the same thing but in different
[1:43:45] words unto peter
[1:43:46] jesus
[1:43:49] so peter you're my disciple
[1:43:52] you're you're a believer peter you've
[1:43:55] got faith
[1:43:57] but you have yet to be converted
[1:44:01] so then how then are we converted
[1:44:04] when we receive that baptism of the holy
[1:44:06] ghost
[1:44:09] we are then now born again
[1:44:12] to go from convinced unto converted
[1:44:17] peter was convinced supernaturally pedro
[1:44:19] sovereign a sovereign natural mention
[1:44:22] when he was called to be a disciple
[1:44:25] he was convinced by the wisdom of jesus
[1:44:27] christ
[1:44:30] he was convinced by the miracles that
[1:44:32] jesus performed
[1:44:36] he was convinced by the very life in
[1:44:38] itself of jesus
[1:44:41] jesus a convinced believer
[1:44:45] and maybe someone in here is only a
[1:44:46] convinced believer today
[1:44:51] and you know the pastor is so humble
[1:44:56] it's convinced me me a convention the
[1:44:58] sisters are so
[1:44:59] sweet it's convinced me
[1:45:03] unconventional the ministers they're
[1:45:05] just so wise it's convincing
[1:45:09] the church is so orderly it's convincing
[1:45:11] me
[1:45:14] this message of the hour has so much
[1:45:16] revelation it's convincing me
[1:45:18] yes
[1:45:21] and amen to all of that but
[1:45:24] have you received the holy ghost since
[1:45:27] you believed
[1:45:42] that's
[1:45:54] to break past that intellectual
[1:45:57] righteous christian mentality
[1:45:59] mentality christianity intellectually
[1:46:02] enter
[1:46:03] into being converted christians
[1:46:08] that's why i say put yourself in that
[1:46:10] scripture foreign
[1:46:24] joshua
[1:46:29] [Music]
[1:46:38] but
[1:47:05] and to enter into being converted
[1:47:16] see peter had forgotten an experience
[1:47:17] that he had previously had with jesus
[1:47:34] place about the resurrection that was
[1:47:38] going to take place
[1:47:41] but peter got angry peter got bold
[1:47:46] peter the bible says he rebuked jesus
[1:48:16] what a mind-blowing thing
[1:48:19] that in one moment the spirit of god was
[1:48:22] upon peter in the spirit
[1:48:25] in the next moment the spirit of satan
[1:48:28] was upon peter
[1:48:43] don't die jesus please don't die jesus
[1:48:47] why don't you just stay with us
[1:48:50] you're the son of god
[1:48:54] teach us a little bit more do a couple
[1:48:57] more miracles
[1:49:04] that the perfect sacrifice had to be
[1:49:07] offered
[1:49:10] that the lamb had to be slain
[1:49:22] that nothing could impede that from
[1:49:24] happening
[1:49:26] it didn't matter what good intentions
[1:49:28] peter might have had no importa
[1:49:31] anything that tried to stop that plan
[1:49:37] was nothing more but satan himself
[1:49:39] [Music]
[1:49:41] and that's how simple it is i'll see
[1:49:43] this in the u.s your brother
[1:49:45] he can be anointed of god in one moment
[1:49:50] and he's lifting you up and then in an
[1:49:53] instant
[1:50:20] his or her flesh can be anointed
[1:50:50] we don't
[1:50:59] they might be anointing your brother or
[1:51:01] anointing your sister
[1:51:05] they might be causing you to have that
[1:51:07] difference or dissension among each
[1:51:08] other
[1:51:13] we've got to see behind that
[1:51:16] and judge the spirit but now coming back
[1:51:19] to the future
[1:51:22] jesus said jesus but i have prayed for
[1:51:24] thee
[1:51:26] that thy faith failed and when thou art
[1:51:30] converted
[1:51:32] strengthened
[1:51:46] i want you to truly be converted
[1:51:50] once you're truly converted
[1:51:54] then you can strengthen your brothers
[1:51:58] you can guide your brethren
[1:52:06] peter was still focused on the fleshly
[1:52:08] things and not the spiritual things
[1:52:09] pedro
[1:52:10] established the spirituality therefore
[1:52:13] that's why peter replied
[1:52:29] i'll go to jail for you i'll go to jail
[1:52:31] with you
[1:52:32] i'll fight with you i'll do anything to
[1:52:34] be by your side
[1:52:38] and what an awesome god we serve today
[1:52:42] that
[1:52:58] he knew that we would choose him
[1:53:03] therefore he made us sons and daughters
[1:53:05] of his
[1:53:08] he chose for us to be his bride
[1:53:22] forgive me jonah he knew that jonah was
[1:53:24] going to deny
[1:54:04] the shall not crow this day no
[1:54:10] before thou shalt three times deny that
[1:54:13] thou
[1:54:13] knowest me.
[1:54:18] and we go back to the base scripture is
[1:54:27] it said the steps of a good man are
[1:54:29] ordered by the lord
[1:54:34] that though he would fall okay
[1:54:37] the lord upholdeth him with his hand
[1:54:42] so the very footsteps of disobedience
[1:54:45] from jonah and just las propios
[1:54:47] pasos de dis
[1:55:02] don't you think that peter by any means
[1:55:04] possible
[1:55:08] he would have not denied the name of
[1:55:09] jesus christ
[1:55:12] but jesus christ was the word
[1:55:16] and the word had said peter
[1:55:19] you will deny me three times pedro
[1:55:23] negara you will deny me me that was the
[1:55:26] word of god
[1:55:28] to deny jesus it almost seems illogical
[1:55:33] but the word made flesh spoken
[1:55:36] and therefore it had to take place
[1:55:40] for all that was inside of peter
[1:55:44] it was up to him he would have never
[1:55:47] done that
[1:55:49] because he had just got done saying
[1:55:52] with all of his heart with the
[1:55:54] conviction
[1:55:55] with the sincerity that he would die for
[1:55:58] jesus
[1:56:09] it was preordained for peter to do so
[1:56:12] preorder
[1:56:14] the footsteps of the righteous
[1:56:17] peter was of those righteous pedro
[1:56:21] his denial was already ordained
[1:56:26] that though peter should fall pedro and
[1:56:29] that peter would deny jesus
[1:56:32] the lord would still uphold him with his
[1:56:34] hand
[1:56:37] your footsteps are ordained today
[1:56:39] suspense
[1:56:48] he will hold you up by his hands
[1:57:02] three desperate days in the belly of the
[1:57:05] whale
[1:57:08] just like peter asico pedro it took him
[1:57:11] three times
[1:57:14] to be accused to be chased
[1:57:18] they said to be pointed out they said
[1:57:21] to be marked
[1:57:35] i don't know this man whom you speak up
[1:57:39] he was so scared he was so concerned
[1:57:44] he was so desperate that he had to say
[1:57:47] something to get out of this corner he
[1:57:49] was in a
[1:58:06] he remembered those words that the lord
[1:58:08] jesus christ told him
[1:58:12] that before the crow
[1:58:16] thou shalt deny me three times
[1:58:19] and he went out isalio and he wept
[1:58:22] bitterly
[1:58:24] what a scene that that was it
[1:58:28] that three times he denied jesus christ
[1:58:32] and that on
[1:58:45] he sees the face of god himself
[1:58:49] the lord jesus christ looking at him eye
[1:58:51] to eye
[1:58:54] and he comes back to his mind that he
[1:58:58] had told jesus
[1:59:09] [Music]
[1:59:14] but it doesn't get more depressing than
[1:59:15] that
[1:59:18] maybe you've denied him in your life
[1:59:22] maybe you've denied him up to this point
[1:59:26] you may have had experience after
[1:59:28] experience
[1:59:42] wanting
[1:59:58] this is just too much for me
[2:00:01] please stand we're going to be closing
[2:00:06] but thanks to god
[2:00:10] for the grace that he's extended unto us
[2:00:14] for the promises that he has given us
[2:00:17] for this word that he gave unto us
[2:00:21] that our footsteps have already been
[2:00:23] ordained
[2:00:24] foreign
[2:00:37] peter saw that god made flesh pedro
[2:00:40] said right after he had denied him
[2:00:44] and through all of that swearing and all
[2:00:46] of that cursing
[2:00:50] him so bad
[2:01:36] the pastor isn't the one convincing you
[2:01:38] el paso
[2:01:41] it's not the ministers that are
[2:01:43] convincing you
[2:01:46] it's not your mama your daddy that's
[2:01:48] convincing you
[2:01:52] but it's the word of god that has
[2:01:53] convinced you this far
[2:01:58] you've been convinced that the god
[2:02:00] almighty he is
[2:02:09] otherwise you can't even explain the
[2:02:11] existence of the universe
[2:02:15] of the universe you've already heard him
[2:02:17] use the yellow or y'all you have heard
[2:02:19] him for yourselves
[2:02:22] because then you can't explain the
[2:02:23] little faith that's already in your
[2:02:25] heart
[2:02:28] and you're feeling him this morning
[2:02:35] how can you explain that you're here
[2:02:37] right now
[2:02:41] that spiritual part of god that's in you
[2:02:43] it's a part of spirituality
[2:02:48] [Music]
[2:02:58] back to oneness with god
[2:03:04] back to that oneness
[2:03:07] don't let that opportunity pass you by
[2:03:12] he's here this
[2:03:26] to have the faith and take that step
[2:03:31] but that can be you this morning
[2:03:35] you can go past being just convinced
[2:03:40] and
[2:04:08] there comes a time diego momento where
[2:04:11] the spirit was leading the lamb
[2:04:13] cuando el espirito giava al cordero the
[2:04:15] dove
[2:04:16] la paloma there had to be a conference
[2:04:18] between the lamb
[2:04:20] and the dove
[2:04:36] it was the dove that had to talk to the
[2:04:39] lamb
[2:04:42] it was about the lambs
[2:04:46] and the lamb young and beautiful life
[2:04:50] um
[2:05:13] is your love for that sinful that
[2:05:15] stinking world that you were born in a
[2:05:18] castle
[2:05:22] do you love them enough to forfeit your
[2:05:24] own life
[2:05:28] do you love them enough to take their
[2:05:30] place
[2:05:32] to bear
[2:05:44] [Music]
[2:05:46] such
[2:05:59] such a desperation
[2:06:41] but i'll drink no more
[2:06:55] i'll stop today
[2:07:11] like my master who died for me
[2:07:16] to make my way clear but
[2:07:19] that not my will but let it be your will
[2:07:38] whatever it costs in this
[2:07:41] conference this morning
