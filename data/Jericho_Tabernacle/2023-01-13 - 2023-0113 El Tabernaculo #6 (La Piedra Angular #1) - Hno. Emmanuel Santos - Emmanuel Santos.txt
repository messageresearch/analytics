the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ just as we're standing if we could please bow our heads foreign [Music] there's various people here and because of that there's different needs here just as the prophet he didn't know the person he didn't know what they needed but you through the spirit would Minister unto that person I'm not the prophet Lord but I'm just a servant of yours I don't know the need of the people but I ask that you would Minister unto that need glorious May the glory always be for thee we put ourselves in your hands Lord asking of the help we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen uh just as you're standing I like to read in two parts in the Bible the first one is in Ephesians chapter 2. verse 20. and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstoneado president in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy Temple in the Lord in whom you also are building together for inhabitation of God through the spirit now the second scripture it's in Psalms 118. verse 22. the stone which the builders refused has become The Headstone of the corner may God bless the region of the word you may be seated this evening I want to speak about the Cornerstone we know that the Cornerstone is fundamental it's the foundation now in the last month uh principal I've studied a main theme of the message of the Bible and that is that God makes his redemption in those particles in two parts that's what brother Brandon says God's Redemption is in two parts that's why you find that there are two stones there is a Cornerstone and there is a Capstone as the Bible says he is Alpha Omega and Omega the beginning and the finisher of our faith both parts this evening I want to speak on the cornerstone and as we just read the Cornerstone is Jesus Christ now this Stone avenido indifferentes it's come in different phases first it was manifested in Solomon's Temple being a literal Stone they have to use to build that literal Temple then another Temple the one which is which was the Lord Jesus Christ then there's another Temple which is you all it has to do with every one of those temples now when Jesus Christ himself came in La carne In the Flesh he was that Cornerstone now when he came he had a certain message that he preached Elizabeth I'm going to give you the scriptures before Jesus Christ came he had someone that came before him who was John the Baptist in those days Came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judea it is and saying repent ye for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand that's the main theme the Kingdom of Heaven has come now is at hand now that was John the Baptist also the Cornerstone it's coming phases or in waves in Opportunities Time After Time After Time the Bible says they rejected it the Bible says that God is rich in Mercy opportunity he gives opportunity after opportunity for you to accept that stone for you to accept Jesus Christ when he speaks of Jesus in Matthew 4 17. Jesus from that time Jesus began to preach and to say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand Juan Jesus John and Jesus they preached the same message the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand in opportunities the next phase after John either Jesus and Jesus foreign these 12 Jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go not into the way of the Gentiles and into any City the Samaritans entered that stone environment first came to a single people to Israel Jesus that's what Jesus is here no wine don't go with the Gentiles but since it's in phases it's in waves opportunity God gives opportunity after opportunity and then him seeing they don't accept the opportunity he gives the opportunity to another person God first gave the opportunity to Israel but since they rejected that opportunity now it's given unto you but that's in phases it's opportunity after opportunity that God gives God is rich in his Mercy opportunity he gives the opportunity after opportunity and look at what the message is that Jesus gives his disciples as you go preach saying the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand is at hand unto you is an exposition of the seven Church ages the Philadelphian Church age the very first introduction we have in the way the kingdom of God was to be breached foreign this ministry that he gave them was actually the sharing of his own Ministry Jesus so when Jesus is the the main Stone of the corner without him there's nothing he's the main Stone that's needed principal he's the the main thing in the temple of the Lord from that stone everything else is expanded fundamental first of all you need to start with the foundation and the foundation is Jesus Christ you cannot expand it you cannot grow Jesus so Jesus he expanded with his disciples when he was here on the Earth foreign aura Isa Piedra now that stone no solamente it's not just a stone that stone represent something representative brother Brandon says that it represents the baptism of the Holy Ghost so first of all that's Jesus it was manifested in Jesus then it was manifested in the spirit at the day of Pentecost so Jesus gave power unto the disciples they did not have the power of the new birth though they did what he said they were limited in the power that they had until finally that stone Jesus Christ Jesus Christ in the form of a spirit he entered into them at the day of Pentecost is a covenant so for example let us say that someone buys something let's say when someone purchases a cell phone they buy something they have to read the terms and conditions of what they're purchasing but normally what we all do we just do like this in school and then we accept it we don't read what the terms and conditions are this Cornerstone it has plenty terms and conditions that the Covenant of Grace is an unconditional Covenant um everything's based upon what I'm going to do for you I'm muchos beneficios there's many benefits they're a company that Cornerstone and then finally when Jesus died he resurrected and he was going to ascend into heaven once again he gave the commission unto his men and Marcos this is in March 16 verse 15. this is all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned is and these signs to follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay their hand hands on the sick and they shall recovery observe the power that they were going to have the Cornerstone first of all it was Jesus here on the earth and when he was on the earth he did these same things it was Jesus Christ the same Stone now in his disciples doing the same thing Jesus Christ did when he was here on the earth without that stone usted as you cannot do this foreign without him there's nothing you say paragraph 108. when the man was made in the image of God and then God came down in the image of man to redeem man that brought man and God together remember the message was that the kingdom of heaven so he says that when God descended in the image of man to redeem man that brought man and God together heavens and earth isotos and sonship when the logos became flesh and dwelt among us so that when Jesus came here in his literal body is that the kingdom of heaven was at hand unto them because the same King that was in heaven he became human flesh to be with them and restore them redeem them remember that the Redemption is in two parts the first part is the Cornerstone [Music] how many know that brother Brandon was given a prophecy in French and I would like to read this note is this is the original note of one of them and it was from this man that had interpreted I may not be able to call his names is Right Ladue Ladue Victor Ledoux Victor Ladue Francis he's a full-blooded Frenchman now here's the message now remember the message the disciples preached the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand now the prophecy is because that was chosen the Narrow Path the harder way Dallas walked of your own shoes that was picked the correct and precise decision yes and it is my way because of this momentous decision a huge portion of Heaven awaits thee Los Cielos the the kingdom of Heavens is at hand it's the same message what a huge what a glorious decision this in itself is is that which got which which will give and may come to pass the tremendous victory in love divine now I don't know if it passed over one of you but this is how I used to think I used to think that when the heaven came unto brother Brandon he was going to have a huge section that pertained to him [Music] a huge portion of Heaven awaits now that's what I wondered when I die will it be then I happen to think Heaven is not portioned off to different portions to us up there is the Kingdom of Heaven that's within us foreign but you're still trapped here on this earth now there's a second Redemption of the Cornerstone and then a Capstone are those gracias now there's two Graces now Gracia de salvation the grace of Salvation now there's a second grace of rapture or Rapture in Grace now this is in two parts not everyone can receive the second part is but you're so fortunate to have this message because this message has both parts now it corresponds to you is to get that this message enters in you you don't have to go search anywhere else you need to search in the message both parts both redemptions both Graces both Stones they're in this message you don't have to go search anywhere else it's right here is it possible for a person to have both parts in them yes it's possible it's very possible how about a recording now remember that stone first came unto Israel and it came in phases in opportunities that you would accept it he blinded them even though he gave opportunity after opportunity foreign it says hombre padre de Familia planton Avenue here another Parable there was a certain householder which planted a Vineyard and hedged it round about and dig the wine press in it and built a tower and let it out to the husbandmen and went into the far country and when the time of the fruit junior he sent his servants to the husbandmen that they might receive the fruits of it now I want you to see the waves the phases the opportunities that this man gives and the husbandman took the servants and beat one and killed another and stoned another and again he said other servants more than the first and they did unto them likewise he sent unto them his son saying they will have reverence my son Maslow's labradores but the husband saw the sun they said amongst themselves this is the air beneath come let us kill him and let us seize on his inheritance and they caught him and cast him out of the vineyard and slew him when the Lord therefore and we'll let out his Vineyard until other husbandmen [Music] God gives multiple opportunities and it's got to be a very bad mistake for God to take away that opportunity and give it unto another but like I said that is rich in Mercy he gives the opportunity after opportunity the God is more willing to give you what you want then you even wanting it don't think you'll drain God's mercy God seen that there would be someone that would accept him being that the person that rejected Gibson is the person that will accept the opportunity God gives waves of opportunity finally since these wretched men didn't accept the father gave the opportunity to other men Jesus saith unto them did you never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same has become the head of the corner the Lord this is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes now look what Jesus says here therefore I say unto you the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given unto a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof in English I really like how it says in English because that stone initial element initially came to the nation of Israel but after so many opportunities and gave you the opportunity but it says to be taken from them and given unto another Nation well the gospel's gone throughout the whole world what nation is it America America Mexico chile Chile Argentina Argentina Francia France Italian which nation is it molado they are worthy to take the book and open the seals for thou was slain and has redeemed Us by unto God by the blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nation and after this I beheld and low a great multitude which no man could number is about Nations and kindreds and people and tongues it stood Before the Throne and before the Lambs Blancas closed with white robes and Palms in their hands and one of the elders answered is saying unto me what are these which are rated white robes and once they come winds come day and I said unto him sir thou knows and he said unto me these are they which came out of the Great Tribulation and have washed the robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb foreign therefore are they Before the Throne of God and serve him day and night in his Temple this is shall dwell among them it's not a nation of the earth it's a nation of Heaven because the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand the way that it's at hand is the holy spirit of God being born in you foreign a Chief Cornerstone electing precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded and unto you therefore which believeth he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling that same Stone you accept not everyone can accept it it's elect and precious for the other person but you are a chosen generation royal priesthood Nation Santa and holy nation so then when Jesus said will be taken from the nation of Israel and given unto another Nation he wasn't speaking about a nation here on the earth about his present time or about the future he's talking about the nation in heaven the Christian Life is a flowery bed of ease he is or he's never accepted that experience himself the world hates you and the people will hate you Senor you've got to take the way of the Lord's despised views made fun of or anything else you've got to be different you're born of another Nation my wife as I will quote it again but foreign the Holy Spirit and we've got a national spirit is that's the Holy Spirit coming from God out of Heaven Kingdom of Heaven is at hand unto uses and you act like that makes you conduct yourself as they do up there is because you are of another world we're living in America the Cornerstone it has the first part of redemption which happens inside of you this is we live in America that's right the Corporal part the first part of the Redemption it's not for your body it's for your soul the Cornerstone it has the first part of redemption it makes the kingdom of heaven to be born in you the Cornerstone it doesn't make the Kingdom of Heaven coming to you the Cornerstone it makes you come to the kingdom of heaven he was taken up above it has both parts difficulties there's much difficulties there's there's bitterness okay a companion is that a company though both parts brother Branham also had to confront those bitterness the first bitterness he needed to confronto when he lost his wife and his daughter was that of his of his belly ambas both of those bitterness is they're in both parts when the wise menero Naches they came unto Jesus I believe it was a years after he was born the Bible says that Jesus was a child not necessarily a baby but when those wise men came with Jesus they brought gifts with them one of them was myrrh bitterness [Music] when Jesus was at the cross they gave him a second bitterness the vinegar for him to drink there's bitterness we've got to go through that bitterness it's so fast and they're ugly but this message it has both Grace to overcome the bitterness oh God more important it's very important this message it has both parts so that nation that Jesus spoke of International is the nation from above it's no Nation down here the way that you enter into that kingdom is that the spirit of that Kingdom it first enters in you the Cornerstone it makes the Kingdom of Heaven coming to you and the Cornerstone the corona or the Capstone it makes you come unto the kingdom of heaven that was placed upon the 120. it is and verse 4 it says and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues of the spirit gave them utterances and there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews development out of every nation under heaven and the main nationality for you is Christianity if you're American culture your Mexican culture whatever culture Cristiana it clashes with the Christian culture is you've got to decide what culture is more important for you to be a citizen of what nation that you care most foreign with certain people when he was here literally on the earth wherever the word of God is the word is repeated the story is repeated the Bible is manifested once again just like the stone was rejected and then accepted by others there in the past once again there's a new generation otherwise God wouldn't be just God is just he gives everyone the opportunity he knows already who will accept it and who will reject but he gives everyone the opportunity what opportunity do you have to have this message that has both parts that you need I I am Christianity there's bitterness that every Christian must go through we don't want to go through that but in both parts there's the bitterness there's Grace also but overcome that bitterness there's a parable in the Bible in Luke 14. verse 16. Jesus and he said unto him a certain man made a great supper in paid money and send his servant at supper time to say unto them that were bidden come for all things are now ready and another said I have married a wife and therefore I cannot come is hola that was the first wave the first phase so the servant came and showed his Lord these things and the master of the house being angry said to his servants go out quickly into the streets in the lanes of the city and bring in hither the Poor Los manchos the main Los cojos and the blind it seemed like they weren't included if he said and he says bring unto the the Poor Los mangos Los cojos and the blind and let me show my Mercy unto them and then they'll believe me that's the last call got God's last call supper call is healing that's God's last call so then the second group they received Divine Healing campaigns the brother Brian says in the message you're life worthy of the Gospel did you notice there was three pulls or three turns of it there's different phases different opportunities when they went out first and called unto them that were them to come but they didn't do it there went out a healing campaign went out to get the Blind and the halt God gives the opportunity for them to want to accept and there was a second group this is a second healing campaign to get the Blind and the main reason [Music] the Long Beach California I believe he was in Long Beach California he was uh speaking into an auditorial compartino he was sharing and I believe the person who he was sharing it with Charles Fuller I believe his name was Charles Fuller now the group of this other man Charles Fuller Charles Charles Fuller it's a group that brother Branham says paragraph 256. This is there was his intellectual group of fine dress people walking out of there the first group Maine [Music] opportunity God gives opportunities after opportunities for those that humble themselves enough to accept the Cornerstone foreign will make you do strange things things that you never imagined yourself to do so then the second group was brother branham's group with campaign healings now remember Brandon said that healing was the last call so then why are we still here there was a new group that would come afterwards because brother Brandon was only accepted because of that Supernatural gift that he has when you would pray for the people they would heal but they would reject him for because the message that he brought opportunity God gives opportunities the people only wanted Jesus because it multiply the bread and he will feed them but when he gave them the message that Cornerstone was rejected Jesus Jesus was rejected brother Branham was rejected if you receive that stone usted you will confront rejection um so they rejected brother Branham they didn't want his message they just wanted a supernatural gifts companies brother Brandon said those campaigns should have been the last call but then in verse 22. the Bible says and the servant said Lord is done as that was commanded and yet there is room even though it makes us strange now we've got the opportunity accept God's grace it should have ended 60 years 70 years ago but for some reason the servant returned and said yet there is still room that's where you and I and tramos we enter in the Kingdom of Heaven that's where you and I we had the opportunity to find ourselves with this message that makes the Kingdom of Heaven through the Cornerstone and also the second part that will make you go unto the kingdom of heaven and God gives you Grace to overcome do you want to accept or reject Ed because after that he says this lord said unto the service he said go into the hedges and the streets and force them to compel them to come in so that my house may be filled so the third part pertains to you and just see what brother Branham says he preached this message here in Phoenix the message remembering the Lord so you pray now for us and go out into the streets into the hedges in the highways and ask them no no compel them compel them to come in for this would be a wonderful time visitation for Phoenix to get its great visitation I hint in Phoenix there's people in Phoenix that are part of that third group now what will you do will you accept the Cornerstone you'd be a make you a very strange person it would make you do things that you never thought you'd do you speak it away that before was strange to you it'll make you do strange things but it's worth it continuing it contains a Grace and there's also a second grade but there's bitterness that you need to go but don't worry after the bitterness there's honey after the bitterness do you want that stone or not it's just the beginning of redemption that's the second part and it's worth it he said it'll be a wonderful time for Phoenix to get its great visitation God is including you you've got the opportunity now you want to accept or reject they're in this message [Music] is giving you the opportunity and I know that God is willing when we are ready yes sir when we're ready that's why we we these revivals are some conditions is to try to meet conditions and get ready for this thing to happen if you don't please stand the reason why that stone is always rejected is because it has a strange appearance the reason why Jesus Christ was rejected even the Bible itself says there was no Beauty in him for to be desired it might be strange but for us who have accepted him it's the most beautiful thing we can receive you know I am but there are bitterness Domingo like the brother told us on Sunday you read us the scriptures all those that live Godly in Christ Jesus they will suffer persecution there is rejection that's on that stone but there's also Grace let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your word Lord we thank you for your message that gave me the opportunity and my brother in the opportunity to see if we would accept or we would reject I experiences Lord their bitterness bitter experiences that await us but you yourself went through bitter bitterness help us Lord give us of that Grace and give us to overcome them Minister unto the hearts that are present give them the honey to continue to withstands the bitter bitter moments they need to go through help us Lord we're in your hands we ask you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you [Applause] [Music] baby [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] videos [Music]
