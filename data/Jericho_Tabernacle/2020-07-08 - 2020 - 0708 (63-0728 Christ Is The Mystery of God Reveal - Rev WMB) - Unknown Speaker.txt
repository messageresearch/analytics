service does anybody know where the dowel family any of them got down today or not sister down brother brown are you here brother brown yes I'm late and the brother dowel is still with us and wonderful brother Dow almost leftists see we can't stay too much or ask too much he's already 21 years the past the time that God told him to live that's an ordinary lifetime a past a time that God told him he could live but we had a call the other morning that he was he was dying and we rushed up there and the Lord God was really good to him is spared him just I think he he's ready and just waiting the coming of the Lord but you know we all hold on to one another we just the old fella is like a like a dad to me here I'm everything sitting right down here in the old Tabernacle the old part when he that light flashed across on that water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ right out there he comment about 87 88 years old on a stick come right up here and said I wanna go riding there and be baptized somebody went got him some clothes he couldn't wait til the next time he had come right then alright and so I like that instead the other day I was talking to him he said you think I'm alright now brother branham I said did you ever go to a doctor for a physical checkup he said yesterday I so the doctor cuts tear scopes in his ears and put them on your heart see if your heart's beating right in an electrical cartogram and then blood pressure urine tests and so forth instruments to find out where your physical being now the way he does that he looks back on a book here were specialists on these different subjects writes down if this takes place this is what's wrong and I said now the only steer scope that I have is the Bible aim or the soul I said I'm gonna give you the test I said Saint John 5:24 said he that heareth my words I said that isn't listening to it that's receiving it ever seen it you believe it something inside of you tells you it's right you've accepted it you believe it it's yours either Europe it's already yours my word and believeth on him that sent me you believe that he said I do I said then I'll tell you what the chief doctor said he's passed from death unto life and shall no more come into condemnation our judgment I said as far as I know according to the books you pass the examination at old man of nearly a hundred years old not a church man at all but just the first time that light flashed across his path he received it ci predestinated seed laying there see as soon as the light strikes it it comes to life right quick now I know it's hot today and I look like it's hard for me to call you people together for our service where you sit jammed in like this but yet I thought by the grace of God that I would have another service before I had to leave you on for a short season I trust and I've got to go now tomorrow night to Chicago to begin Wednesday ought to get there a little early if possible and rest up a little before beginning a series of service and I believe they got it here I was looking at right here it's advertised up there it's called the Moringa area yeah marigold marade oh yeah area arena Mariga arena it's worth to be held beginning Wednesday night through Sunday and the Full Gospel businessman has a breakfast also on on Saturday morning and I don't know just where they got that advertised for no then start the evenings at the lean tech I see yours that every time now if you're around in that area up there it's be a regular if just a regular evangelistic service like we have at any time most the message is a beef primarily on something that's been talked to your course here's where we make our tapes you see out there they can fuss but if they get tapes made from here that's up to them if they want to listen to any tape it comes right from here this is our own pulpit so out there use the I'll try to pick around on something not very deep because many of them are shallow and experience and what comes in but your I feel I have a right to say whatever God puts up on my heart to say from right here so our tapes are all made from right here and they're riding the room there now you see their heads up or the cloud of glass in there where they're sitting with their recorders now on if you want to come to the meeting we'd be most happily to have you just if you get there don't know just where to go I just contact any of the Full Gospel people our brother Carlson and he'll you'll tell you that's um you can advise your the Philadelphia Church or any of them they can tell you right how to get to the place then I come back the next Monday evening sometime afternoon or evening and Tuesday we go back to Arizona for for putt the children's school and so forth and then I don't know just exactly when to be back again because the Lord I want him to leave me just don't want to do a very strange thing happened I might as well I know this is taped I might as well place it on here and right while visions and leadings of the Holy Spirit is moving I like to strike just exactly while it's a moving that's now the last year it's been that one right along with one of the most highest time for visions that I've ever had and all my ministry has been this last year of things that has taken place that you people know that it's foretold before it happens and it happened just the way it's said now we come back here and into a visit the climate in this place I certainly don't like cuz it just breaks me down as soon as you get here and I just I can cross the top of the knobs a parent come down in this valley and I'm here about ten minutes I got high get sick weather swimming in it everything looks spooky dark and I I just have to get out of it see and the other day I was talking to the wife but what brings me in first what brings me in here is you people me this church itay of all the places I went my life this is my favorite place to come preach the gospel and it looks like it we can make a tape from here it's ten times better than anywhere else the s reason I say we're God's doing something and stay right with that but I think what the great thing is that's me failing to go out at the first time when he called me and therefore he makes it kind of rough on we want to come in obedience is better than sacrifice and then I'll be coming back and forth all the time preaching in the Tabernacle in you people it's from out of town you're being notified Billy Paul would be here right in the office and and then be reached at any time through him and we'd be coming back here and then the seven trumpets is coming up right away the Lord willing seven last plagues and the vials and so forth just as we can get a little cooler weather maybe or something however the Lord leads and now the other day coming in uh it was a question brought up about something about someone had given me a check and said personally exactly just to me and the only tax paid free everything else what we went and Billy knew that I Connie had need of that check not you went and asked the attorneys if we could cash and he said why he's American citizen why can't he cashes he says tax paid and everything it was free any citizen can do that so then he couldn't be satisfied with that really so he goes to the public accountant he said why certainly you can cash that said he's in since the United States so well he couldn't think good about that so he called Merle Miller the head of the the tax Association at at Indianapolis there was our attorneys and so I simillar so sure it's all right hey hurry can have that check it's it's uh it's made out to him and Dorsey only I can only one can't endorse it go forth and it couldn't be stamped with our CI don't cash no checks that's what they got me for the other time somebody bringing a bunch of checks and say you're a brother branham at the meeting I'd say we didn't Branham William Branham well the government's taking care of all that a whole time I was signing to myself is paying the debts out there they said I will delinquent taxes on all of it anyhow three hundred thousand dollars so so then that's where the fuss came so then as soon as I put the check in whammy here come the agent right bank said we reopen the case for him now so it made it kind of rough and brotherly veils sitting here I guess it's all right to say it we just had come down and this fine scholar Baptists your head i baptize him in the name of Jesus Christ here food yesterday brotherly Valen and so it's really a fine man a brother in Christ he's preached for sure before highly intellectually educated and besides that a spirit-led man and the light flashed across him he said he'd try to get away if it just couldn't do it so I baptized him right here good morning couldn't stand it any longer so we just come down here put on her clothes when he was baptized the name of Jesus Christ well I thought been taking that fine spiritual food maybe to talk a little bit we take some natural food so he goes over to blue board sets down was talking except you come up how can you let people talk about you like that now our brother Vail one of the finest man they ever know but he's just a little too quick on the trigger always told her you know and so on yeah it's all I said I hope that's alright brother so what he's I said don't lie loose all at once that's still gloves the ones are doing it he said I might be alright for you he said he said but well I believe he is so smart so that's what he's been meeting those smart intellectual people so he just knows how to pour it in there and they ain't got no place to stand so I said look brother bail was set at the Blue Boar I said David one day after being thrown from the throne by his own son run off the throne mutiny Israel divided and David took off the throne by his own son and was going out of the city weeping and a guy that didn't like his last a message you know he didn't care for him little old fella kai crippled up going along there I'm making fun of him and he spit on David and that's guard drew that swords that I'll lift the head of that dog stay on him spit on my King David said let him alone the Lord told him to do that spit on making fun of him and then spitting so the Lord told him to do that well we know the story I returned Bank brother Vale though that took a whole lot of grease to do that so no more coming back and entered in the office public accountant called Billy Paul and told him about this so brother Vale went up the house with me I walked in out said to the wife long about sometime the afternoon we wanted to room I said I got something to tell you honey we just been talking for left she said bill I know that God sent you out there we all know that but he never told you come back he said huh that's where I'm worried about I said well I think it's for you and the children don't matter for me I'm gonna serve Him Lord willing more ever ago and so walk back not told her about it like that so I just turned around laid my head up somebody said something about hold this tax collector who Oliver I just kind of raid it out of something I can't not thinking of what I told brother Bale I said let him alone maybe the Lord told him to do that and no more and said that the light flashed on the wall and rolled across her brother Vale my wife sitting there come on back to Arizona with letters rolled across the wall come on back to Arizona I'm trying so here I go and then back to Arizona now this week has been a week of great blessings we had private interviews this week of people who have been waiting since seven seals and I would don't doubt but some of them course was called in from out of the town across the nation but the morning before the interview started setting in the room the Holy Spirit let me ride out exactly everything they knew everything they wanted to ask rotate the questions just the way they want to do and tell them their dreams and interpretation before they ever told me now that people are in the room you're there and I go ahead and let them talk and say well brother branham I come such-and-such I said now remember we have symbol here not for fellowship we haven't come here to fellowship with one another there is a question in your mind in your heart that that you've stumbled into and you don't know what it is and maybe I'll be able by the help of God to do it I said remember the Queen of the South had some questions to when she came to Solomon and the Bible said there was nothing revealed or helped back to what Solomon couldn't answer for now I said of greater than Solomon this year right the Lord Jesus promise wherever two or three are gathered in my name there I am in the midst of them what so everything they can the think of our desire and and she lasts it shall be given to them and now your question is something you don't know about something you don't know how to approach about something you don't know what to do about and I said again the scripture said this that the angels of God are encamped about those who fearing so in another world where the five census does not declare the five senses only contacts this world you have no feeling you couldn't feel nothing feeling won't be nothing to you that'd be another world you have no sight what you look at would be another world you know nothing about it so these five senses is the only thing that God let us lose to now there is another one called faith but by faith you walk up a ladder finally you can get so high until you break into another world which is vision there you can see just like if you never know what this was you is feeling with your sense of feeling never seen it then your eyes come open you can see it it'd be all mystery to that person who never could see you'd be a mystery to him but yet that's it and in there the Lord before we got here two people from across the country everywhere north south west come in for these interviews and as soon as they get through talking just exactly the questions they would ask the thing that they would asked about I'd say watch here raised over and that was a piece of paper with every question to rotate yes exactly why they asked it was going to a sit there answer down here to their question just answer down the Lord is great you know it's all things but yet take me about three days to come out of that afternoon well it was such a tear down and now I thought to get it all before we left and there is a proper way the real way to individuals now these things can be said and if the people share that knows that secrets of hearts that was revealed that would absolutely it would be horrible it calls time because somebody shoot another or something if that be revealed right here at the platform like this in a pub and before the public it would cause penitentiary and offenses and everything else that way but when you're setting together like that the Holy Spirit just two of you together but we understand this that what they ask me is private I say nothing about it and what I say to them it's up to them where they want to say it or no I think but it's been on between us the interview that's taken the person one by time and setting there until everything is completely settled see the Holy Spirit and then to think of the grease the Holy Spirit telling me all about it to each one a whole line them before they ever even got here across the country comes in people I've never seen in life and ride it out so if they had no just a routine according to the questions the way they would answer it one brother had questions on the serpent seed that I didn't get the answer just exactly calls her little half-hour was up I hoped that he got it all right the answers to it on the paper I it rolled out he didn't get to all of his answer so I just give him variety back the answers on the paper if he hasn't Billy Paul has it I know the man sitting here I just looked at in just a few moments ago so if he if he wants to find that it's rolled out on a piece of paper and your answers to your question now oh how good the Lord is I hope everybody's feeling good and now lets us remember now when I pray for these tanks ships do you remember brother Dow he's the precious brother and we want to remember him in prayer and I see brother Agron but I can't see sister Unger in anywhere whether she's all right now yes sitting right out from him sure yeah I'm glad course was called out to the night in a just emergency case of her and her daughter sister I down he down he run off the road and just the grace of God are they both been crushed to pieces right there and here they come out on the church got on a train he come on I'll never forget you all I love you God knows in I love you how across the countries you slick weather when I look at some brother here from Georgia and Alabama and different places and tennis scene around where they ride their car down the road where the ice slide and back and forth I get to come here for one service when I had that emergency called her brother Dow the other day I didn't realize the liable how us so far away yes I thought that's a little skip hopping a jump and my I let your real early that morning never got there to one o'clock out afternoon driving every everything this feat limit would allow and there on dual highway and I think how close that is to way down in the South away these other people come from way out in the north and west where they come I love you and that's reason I try to be deadly sincere here and the old-timers I see brother Creech them setting back there now and wants to spend with me all these years and things and how we come up together I was looking at Mary Jo's picture I believe was a couple nights ago just a little bitty tiny thing when we first met now she's guessing our children brother creats and sister Creech young black headed and median I and here we are a gray and stooped over see there's something about people like that it grips you me you you you want to stay with them see there's top another that it always makes your mind pull back just giving them for examples to others that you're young and old we look forward for the coming of the Lord so this morning I have to put it God I believe put it in my heart to teach a Sunday School lesson here this morning God willing for a length of time okay and I this being my last service for a little while as far as an old the and I want you to remember that rather naval your left in the church in the charge of this Tabernacle honor the Holy Spirit and he's left here and he believes this messages and teaches it just the same as I do all right and anytime she wanted you can see fit to come to here brother navel he certainly what do you good I'm sure the great servant of Jesus Christ I've noted arm and Neville since I was a little boy and he hasn't changed one speck only got closer to God I remember when I first saw him on earth I was invited to his Methodist platform and when I come back here at the Tabernacle I said someday I'll baptize him his name is Jesus Christ I have enough here we used with the message not going on a real gallant servant and brother Neville goes too many strings and heartaches that he does his short you're at the Tabernacle but being that the Lord lets me have a little sight into people's life I know what he goes through whole lot of it see and he certainly goes under a lot of labor and strains and things and you new people here hold him up like Joshua Caleb who held up the hands of Moses as he's bringing the word love one another above everything love one another don't no matter what the devil tries to say now you're all one great big sweet group now but remember my warning hey Satan won't let that stay that way no sir he'll shoot everything he has bring somebody in to make his target hmm he'll bring some critic unbeliever is setting down and causing the fellowship with you other quite distant things then either shoot that guy with some kind of it poisoned stuff and you'll start to the church with it don't you take sides with it don't you to have nothing to do with anything else you stay right loving and sweet and kind to one another pray for that man that he'll be saved too or that woman or ever hood is it pray for them and stick one with another and stay with your pastor see he's the Shepherd and you give Him respects he leads you through and cause he's ordained of God to do so how do you remember that the enemy will come and when he does it's clean that much closer together and the one that the devil is used in foreign enemy will either get out or come into you one of you that's all don't never clan among one a tall make yourself clenched we are one I couldn't say left hand I'm mad at you I'm going to take you away cause you're not a right hand he's my left hand I want him to stay there even the little tip of my finger I wanna stay right there every little part of my body stay right there and God wants us as the body of believers to stay right exactly with one another write it with one another and now you've got tapes on man you got tapes on what we believe you've got tapes on discipline in the church how we behave ourself in the Church of God how we got to come here together and sit together in heavenly places don't stay home God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open up to get in here to fellowship with your brothers if you don't don't feel that way then I'll tell you it's time you got to prayin cause we're in the last days where the Bible exalted us just too much more as we see that day approaching to love one another with Christian love and divine love to symbol ourselves together in heavenly places and and and Christ Jesus and loved one of this will all man know you're my disciples when you have loved one for the other try to stay right together if the brother you think he's a little wrong with the sister say Lord don't let me ever have the root of bitterness springing up cause you know it'll affect him and it'll take the Christ right out of my life that poison assets of a malice and jealousy and hatred that let's take the Holy Spirit rod away from you running from the Tabernacle here it'll kill the Spirit of God or drive it away from here hurt your pastor it'll do everything see don't you do that you just wax that much closer together draw the take the buckle as a brother testify to ministry here the night about having a buckle seen it in a vision just add buckles on the whole armor of God just put it on and tighten up move around a post you one another love one another anyhow Pope nice about one of the say nice things about one another and then God will bless you now this morning the Lord willing bias help and grace I got quite a bunch of questions hearing I have scriptures rather and now before we approach it I think I heard that recorders click alone in there we are going to bring the message now by God's grace first a word of Prayer Lord Jesus speaking to this body of the church that they should hold together with God's unchanging hand their absolute the word warning them as Paul warned his flock that there be wolves enter in your the same God today as you were then and that enemy is the same may this fellowship and bonds of love always exist amongst these people in Christ Jesus help this morning Lord as we read the word may the holy spirit reveal it to us that the church might be fully established in the faith that was once delivered to the Saints to hold Ammon may as you gave the vision some two years ago to store up the food fine healthy-looking vegetables that I saw in the vision being stored here in this tabernacle may we today receive a whole barrel full of that granite Lord our tape load that it might reveal Jesus Christ to us in the hour that we live to give a sustaining strength spiritual strength for the past that lays ahead granted father bless these thy children they're in here this morning from many different parts of the nation hot sticky morning but yet we feel the presence of the Holy Spirit and all this we think of John Wesley and Calvin and sink in Knox Finney and many of those even without electric fan or people set in halls and preparation running down their faces the women well covered and dressed said of the audiences and perspire till their clothing was soaking wet listening to the Word of God feeding their souls now we feel are there rest somewhere honor waiting the coming of the Lord keep us together father let the Holy Spirit guide us and direct us give us long life of service for you give us this great message this morning at we're expecting out of thy word that it might go to each heart make the lips that speak Lord speak truth make the heart but years be fertile to receive truth I may it grow into great trees of eternal life to be shining lights and red epistles of all man they might know that Jesus Christ has raised from the and lives among us make it so full of love in the fruit of the Spirit other man and women boys and girls can see the results of the life of Christ still living in us after 2,000 years from the great event granted father to honor thee we asked in Jesus Christ's name Amen now I want to read some out of the scriptures and I trust now that you've got your pencils and papers and everything ready and brother Neville you're sitting still how many go take my coat off excuse me for taking off my coat but this this is a awfully warm up here I want you to turn to the book of Colossians the first chapter of cloth and then while we read this beginning with I want you when you go home to read the entire chapter of these cloth sins but I want you to read this morning with me from the fifteenth verse 29 inclusive and I'll just be as patient as you can or I filled it in this year if God will help me will reveal and bring into your mind all these other things that I have talked on all through the days of the tabernacle why I have said what I've said and why I have done what I have done this is why now from the fifteenth birth who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him we're all things created that are in heaven and that are in the earth visible invisible were they be Thrones dominions principalities powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the prim poor heed please the father that in him should be all fullness dwell should all fall as well let me put a little emphasis on that again this nineteenth birth bar it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things and to himself by him I say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven watch what that reconciliation went and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works you now has he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy unblameable approvable in his sight if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and not be moved away from the hope of the gospel which you have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven were loved I Paul made a minister who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is bound behind all the affections of Christ in flesh for his body's sake which is the church or rod I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which has been hidden from age and from generation but now is made manifest to his Saints I want to read that verse again even the mystery which has been hidden ages and from generations but now is made manifest to a saint the whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man and all wisdom that we might present every man perfect in Christ Jesus I want you are also labor striving according to the working which worketh in me mightily now for a text I want to take out of there this for a text basing it upon the entire Bible but I want to title this Christ is a mystery of God revealed Christ being the mystery of God reveal now I took it in order as the Sunday School lesson so we could all read together and and have this fellowship together now God's secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back part of God's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive and doing in order to let himself be expressed because first there wasn't even a moon star atom molecule or anything he was gone but he exactly wasn't God at that time because God is an object of worship and there wasn't nothing to worship Him so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed and in him was love in him was to be father in him was to be son in him was to be a savior in him was to be a healer all these great attributes that we see already expressed they were in God so my opinion the first thing that he made was angels and then they worshiped him and that made him God and he started from there as in previous messages I have tried to explain it break it down and now then when angels begin to worship Him that was before there was even a molecule in the earth there was nothing it's all darkness there was no Sun there no moon no stars no nothing then he was God as he asked Jobe where was you when I laid the foundations of the world I think when the morning stars sang together the sons of God shouted for joy now where were you see way back before the earth now God had a purpose and a hidden mystery and that's why I want to speak on to the church this morning the hidden mystery of God that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how that's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living thing then you will understand clearly then see oh I believe what is being done God's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody know nothing about even the Angels didn't understand it he he didn't read me that's reason under our seventh mystery when the Seventh Seal was open they were silent Jesus when he was on earth they won't know when he would come he said it's not even the son himself don't know when it's gonna happen the God has this all to himself it's a secret that's reason there was silence in heaven first face the half hour and seven thunders are their voices and John was even forbidden to ride it the the coming of the Lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't know he is showed or revealed it in every type that's in the Bible therefore the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ hmm the entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had won a purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible and all the acts of the the believers in the Bible has been in tight and expressing what God's great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it it shows it and God's help will you see if I here this morning what the Lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it therefore you can see the great meaning of what it's been to know this and then try to bring it to the people see and then you don't I have him went into details to try to explain it as God has revealed it to me now if you want to mark this down I got so many places I want to read from and now in in the book of st. Luke the 24th chapter of Saint Luke we find out it's it is the two of the Apostles on the road to Emmaus and Jesus stepped out after his resurrection and they were on the road over to Emmaus going along the road thinking and talking and weeping on account of Israel is and how they seen him suffer for what they thought was no value at all they took their lord and crucified Him and and they were going along I weeping and he stepped out from the roadside and begin to talk to them about Christ he said old fools and slow to understand don't you know that all the prophets and the Psalms think what was he doing identifying himself to these apostles that all of the prophets and all of the song and everything was him expressed they I now the reason I never tucked to preach this morning must be called I thought in teaching we would understand it better than just to take a text and skip over it we just teach it he was saying that all the Psalms and all the prophets spoke of him well therefore that shows that all of the Old Testament all of the New Testament and all of the Psalms are singing the songs that were sung were sung of him take the twenty-second song and sing it and compare it with the morning of the crucifixion think my God my God why has thou forsaken me all my bones they stare at me they pierced my feet and my hands yet all those things there at them singing that song down there in the temple and crucifying the very one see see those great religious leaders those great man those great teachers and yet so blinded that was reading the prophets and was singing the songs and doing the crime that they said they would do the same thing is taking place this morning now listen close cause I ain't gonna even pay attention to what that clock says I want you to get these things don't you see so you can see here basically in the beginning the very thought that God had in his mind he hid it from all of those scholars and just a number of selected predestinated number a predestinated people was the only ones that heard it I now search back the scripture down through the age of the prophets and see if it was the same thing now that Jesus shared referring them to the prophets and the sound he said they all spoke on me see and hear these Jewish teachers rabbis doctors of the law professors had did exactly like they had done before now I noticed again he said search the Scriptures for they are they that testify on me search the Scriptures the scriptures the entire scriptures what am I trying to do to show you that this Bible is the thing it's right the other day standing a hospital room halkan sister it asked me to explain about denominations why we was against denominations with some denominational people you see it's got to come back to the word because the word is God I think and Jesus declaring the same year that the word is him you can't make the scripture contradict itself in the beginning was the word wars with God in the Word was God and the Word made flesh then now here he says search the Scriptures they testify on me in them you think you have eternal life that's true and they are the one that bear record of me and I'm bearing record of them if I do not the works that's promised that I would do that don't hear me but if I do the work so you can't believe me believe the works because they testify that he is the word oh it looks like it couldn't be any plainer thing all right now search the scriptures he said Moses and all the laws and so forth and the prophets and psalms spoke of a and again he said the scriptures testify of him he is the principal theme of the entire Bible if you read the Bible and don't see Christ in every verse of it go back to read it again if you can't see Christ in every verse of the Bible then you read it again because you missed something the Bible is Christ he is the word when you read in the beginning God created there's Christ see every from that to the Amen in Revelations is every word testifying of Jesus Christ that's why these added books that call the second Book of Daniel in the book of the Maccabees adds purgatory and stuff like that see it's not spoke up in the scripture see it doesn't theme up with the rest of it there's no place to place purgatory in there there's no place to place intersection of saints and things there's no place in there for that there's no place for a denomination there's no place for the Creed's outside of the of the Bible so when you see those things they just don't come into the picture and that's why people is added those and got there they're they're jigsaw puzzle all mixed up then they can't make it right same yesterday today and forever but if the things put together right there's an entire picture of the fall and regeneration the whole picture of creation of God's whole plan revealed right in Jesus Christ amen that's the whole picture set together every little crook and corner it's just like no I don't mean to be sacrilegious for this but if it's just like putting a jigsaw puzzle together that's why we got pictures today that looks horrible say we are believers the cow picking grass up on top of the tree don't work that's when they say yeah he's ever way but just of a certain he's same yesterday forever all but a certain things he then you ruin your picture the Bible said he is the same st. John PI or st. John 14:12 he said he he anybody he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also well that was for another age there you got your picture wrong again you got a man fishing out the desert for fish and a bunch of hot saying where there's no fish I had thing see you've got to bring you back to where he's fishing at Galilee where these plenty of fish you see they you you got to make the picture look right it's God's great picture is only one way you'll sit that when you see Jesus Christ there's the entire Bible he's the principal theme of the Bible are you realized in any of these places here you could take a text it's just hard for a preacher hold his peace you look like you want to keep going with it but you got to get back to what we're teaching on the Bible is a prophetic book it's a historical book it's a book of love it's a book of songs it's a book of life and in there you find Christ he was in the prophets he was in the Psalms he was in the history and he also in the Bible is the things that is to come so he was before enter after what that is that making day is the same yesterday today and forever and you inject something in there that doesn't make him the same yesterday and forever brotherly where do you go to you got an awful picture there for he was the history see and he is the prophet he is the Psalms he is everything and if you can't make him everything and the same word what's your Fisher the pike do you see it all right he is the thing he was the prophets he was in them he was in the Psalms he was in the history and he is the things to come the same yesterday and forever Hebrews 13:8 if you're right to them he should be then he should be the principle if that's what he is and we believe it don't we then if he is that then he should be the principal theme of our talking of our thinking of our singing of our walks he should be the principal theme of our life if he's the principal theme of the Bible and the Bible is in us then he should be the principal theme of everything that we do say our thing should be Christ that right all right since we think this since he's been meant made the head of all things to us the blushing Center here he's a head of all things to us for he was made for us which we are considered all things he said what about the sinner he was made to be the judge of the sinner if you don't accept it he was made the glory for the believer who does accept it so their thing all things is made by him and for him and it takes the night to express the glory of the day it takes the best-loved dishonor to express the the love and care for the vessel of the honored it takes an evil woman that would wear immoral clothes and his seller morals to express the virtue of a decent genuine lady it takes the crook and a thief in a man to express the genuineness of a real believer a real Christian it takes the hypocrite to short the believer what he is so all things was made by him and since he was made all thing made for all of us all things was made far by him then since that is true we should make our identification should be with him we should be identified ourselves with him because he has a dinner fired himself with us we should be identified with him how by living for him not just a confession so many people take your confession see I'd say it's got to this place now are you a Christian I'm Methodist oh that's a long ways to me even making yourself known as a Christian I look like the Methodist does I'm Baptist look what the Baptist does I'm Catholic look what they do see but the only way that you can actually be a Christian is for Christ to identify himself in you how we got some a stinger there I hope everybody on the tape gets that to think you say I'm Pentecostal that don't mean a thing it's Christ identified in you that's when he has recognized you it's a spoke of tongues Devils does too I shouted the Muhammadans Buddhas and everything shouts the Indians scream at the snake dance hey you're all right they all do cults clans and everything else screaming holiday hollers shouted a baseball game but when Christ is identified in you identifying itself in your christ-like which the word Christian means to be christ-like there's your identification all right now and since he is our identification then we should be identified with him by leading for him notice God has had a three full purpose in this great mystery secret God in His great mystery secret that he had before the world began he's got a three-fold purpose in it and now what we want to grow up on this morning is what is that three full purpose he I believe by the help of God who's present and he'll show it to it now if he had this threefold purpose we want to find out what is this threefold purpose the first thing was that God wanted to reveal himself to the people he couldn't do it as a great Jehovah God who covered all space-time and eternity he could not is too great to ever be revealed to people because it would be too mysterious how could that great beam that never did began that after you went beyond the cycle of a hundreds of billions and trillions and trillions of years of life space and all out into the infinite into the eternity and a great creature that was all that is still in [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] but I thought gives me yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music] you
