Virginia everyone else from Las Cruces thank you all for coming God bless you we are so excited number one we're out of the heat I don't know if that excites you or not [Applause] I don't I don't know

days but that's not number one number one is to come in Fellowship not to hear me this evening pray we hear from the Throne of God Amen I'm gonna ask you to stand for the reading of the words and we want to get into this awesome awesome subject you know when we when we hear about prayer that it changes things I said Amen to that brother when brother Octavio called me and said this is the theme of our meetings I'm the first to be a witness that is changes things amen Amanda go into our scriptures we're going to read James 5 16. Santiago Cinco this is the scripture of our of our uh of our meetings this this weekend and it says confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that ye may be healed you know this this scripture is probably one of the most misquoted scriptures and that we have in the Bible because many times when you hear the scripture and some somebody's saying that really fast it says the pray and they would say the prayer of a righteous man Avail as much amen amen amen but that's not what the scripture says we say that the prayer of a righteous man availeth mucho that's not what the scripture says it says the effectual ferventification of a righteous man amen may the Lord has blessings to the reading of the word [Music] amen amen as I was um as I was uh meditating on this I started reading the the Book of James um it's kind of it's it's kind of one of those books um sometimes I I'm Gonna Keep It Personal that that I personally maybe Overlook sometimes but as as I was reading the the Book of James there was there was one word that really that really caught my attention and it um and if we go back into James um we're going to start with uh five seven and it reads like this be patient therefore brethren [Music] take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering Affliction and of we count them happy which endure ye have heard of the patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender Mercy is so as as I was thinking of prayer and I was meditating on the word prayer I I uh my mind would take me back doesn't mean too many times as I was a child I would I would get up in the middle of the night and I would see my My Mother by her bedside and maybe two three o'clock in the morning and I would see her praying Orlando so many nights were like that countless countless nights I saw the prayer of a righteous but not only did I see or hear the prayers of this lady but I saw the results so many times when we when we when we pray much we we pray to God in a way that if God answers our prayers God is on a level that is so high when God doesn't seem to answer our prayers it seems that God has dropped a few levels anybody experience that is we we take a look at prayer and we see the effects of it but when we don't see those effects of the prayer we wonder why we question God questions why God why did you take my family member for years as I was as I was a teenager growing up I asked God a question every single day I was 14 years old when the Lord took my mother and I said Lord why porque I have prayed you know I saw many Great Men of God that would come to our home there in Silver City even he understood that in Silver City and I would see them pray for my so and I said I know Lord this is foreign las cosas the way that we look at prayer is not the way that it should be when we ask God for something in our lives there is a chance there is a good chance that it's not gonna happen in your life but that doesn't mean that God can still do it he is the same no matter if he answers your prayers Jesus Christ but why is he so much greater to us when our prayers are answered when I found out um it's a little secret that I discovered I was maybe my early twenties for about 10 years of asking why Lord I felt like I was the only person in the world that ever lost a mother you know so many times we go through life we just complain yes I also say we because there's there's a lot of people here that don't complain for that I went through so so many years of my life complaining why aren't you doing this Lord look at my father how many Radiance so many times we have a mindset that we are entitled for the Lord to answer okay we are entitled that is supposed to do it because of what of who we are what we've done oh Lord I went to the I went to the meeting you know I sacrificed I went over there you know I I helped an old lady across the street I fed those because of the works that we see ourselves doing um man I'm preaching to myself this evening a lot of good people here which there is every one of you everyone is of you is good people but when I when I discovered something the Lord the Lord really really dealt with me in this is going to the Book of Daniel sometimes when you have so many notes written and you think everything's all good you always takes you in the opposite directions okay now everyone knows this this uh this scripture here in this story here now if you be ready that at what time you hear that's 3 15 I'm sorry now if you be ready that at what time you hear the sound of the Cornet flute harp Sacrament Sultry and dulcimer and all kinds of music ye Fall Down and Worship the image which I have made well but if you worship not ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands amen is they won foreign [Music] from the burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine handle King yes this scripture here blew my mind the scripture changed the way I saw and viewed prayer but if not see no these Hebrew children had Faith they prayed Adam they knew what they were doing was going against the grain they were going against an entire Empire but as they approached the king they said oh King we understand we know the consequences we're prayed up and we know that when we pray for God to deliver us that we know that he will but even if he doesn't how old they looked at prayer but they looked at prayer in an angle that we fail to look at so with God doesn't come on the scene well God doesn't love me I guess there's something wrong but if we have the change of a mentality that we can say Lord I know you're a Healer I know you're a savior I know you're a provider I know that you are everything but even if you don't see no I will serve you when I'm healthy I will serve you when I'm sick okay I will serve you when I'm rich [Music] because my situation is it gonna change [Applause] that God can do things he can do things in a way where he's speaking but he can also do things in a way where he's silence you it's up to us our situation in a different way how many wanna view our situation in a different way you know patience is something patience is is an amazing thing patience is something that is built that is that we're it's not given to us yes but it's something I believe that we that we earn through life it's molds our character is it helps us to to see things you know when I was young when I was a kid I was I love to fight [Music] when I was a kid I fought brother Jim yeah Jimmy [Laughter] I did see Louise because anything and everything would set me off there was one day I got mad at brother Jim we were playing basketball and I threw a basketball at and then I hit him well I got sent to the pastor's office and I got a message talked about me the following days of how disrespectful we are today I've learned patience along the way Brothers a true story thank you bro it only took us 30 years I've been waiting for that 30 years now yes amen amen now now now we can go a little better yeah the patience is is is an amazing thing um I was um I was in Cape Canaveral uh uh two days ago in Cape Canaveral Cape Canaveral Florida I am La Florida we were um with our company we were uh waiting we we've been patient for the last three years in sending in um in testing or not testing but sending a a new satellite into space in foreign we had an 11 o'clock um uh time then 11 o'clock pm times for the rocket to go up we're there where there are at the at the viewing dock waiting patiently is there with all the the Big Wigs of the company and they're like man yeah we can't wait till tomorrow morning man our stock is just going to be through the room espera [Music] what okay what does that mean que signification just a hush just came over what is it now and about two minutes later yes all the patients that we had over the last three years lunch aborted there was men from South America from India Europe but all had gathered to this point that had worked hundreds of thousands of hours to get to this point and we looked you know vimos and it said lunch is for safety concerns and I said oh my gosh what's gonna happen now talk about grown men that were just devastating devastated well last night I had I had to come I didn't I had to fly back home yesterday yeah we're gonna move the launch to Thursday night I can't be with you because I made prior arrangements with brother Octavio and I ain't gonna miss this I'm going back home Thursday so I'm I'm there getting all the all the the emails electronics and they said Thursday night I got I got emails from the from the guys Muchachos hmm I said man well yeah when this is a good this is a good way to learn patience no we've been patient for the last few years but yeah so in about 30 minutes we're gonna see what's going to happen but as I was contemplating that I could see the Lord kind of working on me and I could see the spiritual aspect of it so many times when we've been working on something in our spiritual life oh we're ready to show it I'm ready I'm ready to do something in the church and the moment that that we're that we think we're going to do it is and you look back and said what went wrong what happened I was getting ready to launch yes I was getting ready just to just to take my my Ministry whatever it may be up to the next level and God comes in at the last minute oh look what I've been doing okay I've been doing all this stuff hold on barely said it's hard oh it's noodle it's hard it's doodle to hold back and you're just ready to start running but the Lord says it's not your time yet that teaches us patience that teaches us how to look at things differently first Peter 3 12. says this this Esto for the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous amen and his ears are open unto their prayers oh my God 15 maybe we're going to work on you this weekend you can get some righteous people man and his ears are open unto their prayers but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil is and who is he that will harm you if he be followers of that which is good but and if ye suffer for righteousness righteousness is sake happy wow that doesn't that's crazy how many how many are happy when they're when there's sick as sick and beans how many are how many are excited and happy when a loved one is dying um man why are you the Bible just seems to just give you blow after blow but and if ye suffer for righteousness's sake Master means and being not afraid of their Terror be troubled but sanctify the Lord God in your heart [Applause] and be ready just um just on the the camp here this weekend to give an answer to every man be ready always no this is an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope the people that are affected around us by us being around them sometimes we don't see it but when somebody asks you what is the reason of your hope Esperanza um whatever what a conversation that is brother Jim hey man what is the reason you know I've seen brother Jim yeah Jim I've known him since I was just just a kid but since I was a kid brother Jim your mother Jim has been the same way on fire for God brother Jim I can ask you what is the reason for your hope is that Jesus Christ man isn't that awesome this is awesome he gave an answer like that ah see he was like um let me get back to you in about 10 minutes let me uh let me Google what a what an amazing thing that is after so many years of good times I don't want to say bad times in God aren't aren't bad that's another thing that you got to get out of your mind there's no such thing as a bad time in God I don't know if anybody's ever thought about that since I've been since I've been going to church I've been good times and there's been bad times there's been tough times but there's not been any bad times I don't care what what you've been going on when you're in the hands of God it's going to be difficult we think so crazy I got a word from the Lord the other day you know what it said location said William William and I'm like wow he up and said wow that's something that's got to change yeah my mentality the way that I look at this has to change it's a cheerful endurance ISO the King James version Santiago as we read on in uh in James 5 16. this is as it talks about the word available it says it produces an advantage wow man okay how many likes you have an advantage so if I if I played brother uh brother Abe does he okay in basketball raise your hands okay if I played brother Abe in basketball the advantage that he has Tom is the only Advantage she has now according to brother a being equal I got into Camp either because he was smoking everybody okay but when he's playing his Advantage is that he has height is there's a common saying that says in sports you can teach a lot of things you can't teach height why there's not much Mexicans in the NBA they can't teach us available produces an advantage now brother Jim taught me this a few years ago yesterday when you add an eth to the word in the Old English it means that it's a continuation significance all right amen so whenever you see eth at the end of the word that's why we love the King James version there's no other version that we that you can you can read it but that's not what we go by the is if you didn't if you didn't know that that's what the prophet told us it is a continuation so when we see the word available that means this is the effectual fervent prayer of a right of a righteous man a veileth mucho um what that means is that it it continually produces an advantage it's not a one-time thing that as we continue to pray foreign [Applause] there's so many things in our lives that we just you know men I gotta get some water real quick getting a little dry it's cool air we're not used to it continues so many times muchas versus now brother brothers said I got an hour and a half I have never ever preached for more than an hour so don't worry we're gonna we're gonna stay good and the reason I tell you that is that story is just coming to my mind all the time and the reason I tell you that is like the second time that I had preached is [Music] here I am good service huh so how much time did I give you the first 30 minutes that was God thank you the next 10 minutes that was you yes too he said don't ever be you my dad man me papa I don't care who you were when you were out of line you're going to get it next time next time you're getting money they're not going to be next ever since then it is man the pastor says I got 40 minutes but here we go oh my goodness when we approach God you know brother Branham says remember him these things I'm gonna read it I'm going to read a quote from him and when we and when we can display the token of the Holy Spirit shows that we have been accepted in Christ that is our token yes that all that we have need of is already purchased by him are identified with our Tokens The Token must be ready the blood Covenant Covenant blood is not recognized without the token the word assures us of the promise the token is the sign the purchase has been made for us but you know why our prayer doesn't work CNN because it takes full obedience man takes patience yeah takes full obedience so many times we worry about what the other person is is doing and we we measure ourselves against everybody else look at me look at me I'm behind the pulpit yes man I see a lot of Sinners the ministers sometimes hold on hold on hold on this Minister sometimes is out of line is when we have Disobedience that's when our prayers do not avail at all they said they have no power what an amazing thing it is to be obedient well how many how how many are fully obedient how many how many how many young people are just just say yes yes sir yes Mom yes yes and you do that all the time not just when say okay okay son if you do this we're gonna go to Disneyland Lassen sometimes we we look at obedience and think that on the other side there's a there's a rewards that's why we're obedient but the moment that we get the moment that we get uh that there that there's nothing behind that okay I don't want to do it but full obedience now we talked about being entitled right this is my last name is Perez so I'm entitled so it says obedience to [Music] this this is awesome it's not to the word of God everybody that's what that was looking down no full obedience to the word of God that's not what it is it's full obedience to the full word of God there's there's times that even if you take out one word it just sets everything off yeah [Applause] but what God said about it all right everybody understood that right full obedience [Music] it's a lot more than prayer than you know that that that's involved in prayer right it's mask you know that prayer changes things but first you better go to God in patience yeah yeah because without that so you're just going to be mumbling words Prayer Changes Things but the way that we look at it prayer that has to change the way that we look at our brother and sisters you know what I learned a valuable lesson how many how many are uh cuantos son how many are high and mighty fuertes okay well you know that's exactly what I thought hey it's excited to look up and say everyone is has humility in here I'm gonna give you an experience of myself because brother William welcome to William felt high and mighty says I'm going to ask you another question okay if you see usted divided the church and you would put in different sections you would say okay all those that were alcoholics go to this section that's do you have a group of people going all those that did drugs go to another section no one has any problems since I did drugs there's those people go to the sections okay all those that that smoked they will go to another section all right we got a section now all those that are high in Mighty altives that section is empty no one has ever felt high in my foreign [Music] this is where I'm going with it so so so so just just just bear with me so here I am devastated upset that the brothers the brother said something bad about me or I am just so angry yeah I said Lord that's that was my friend amigo can't believe we did that nope can't believe he gossiped about it 12 people I did this Lord you got to deal with him show him your powers people better understand you better recognize okay when so there I go to Subway devastated I look at myself in the mirror something just clicks something just knocks me just knocks me out there as I'm looking in the mirror I hear a voice coming it says William he said William have you ever gossiped us when that voice comes you ain't beating around the bush you need the answer is William William have you ever spoken evil about someone yes Lord see Senior William have you ever lied William mentido yes Lord William have you ever cheated William yeah see quite a few history tests so then why does porque do you want judgment on him when I gave you Grace obedience obedience yeah makes you look at yourself makes you look at that reflection in the mirror is in man I am messed up I'm not worried about my brother or sister is messed up and then he says you know why your prayers aren't answered because you're disobediente you know why things in your life are the way they are because of disobedience but brother and sister I can tell you this this evening it's a prayer [Music] the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous Mane mucho it worksione but the way that you see it the way that God does it is you're the way that you see it has to change we can't go on viewing our lives that is just I'm gonna just live my my life the way that it is and anyways the grace of God just covers me the grace of God does not work like that no like when I say is yes see it it brings you out through through a lot of things what's amazing about the grace of God it makes you examine your life I don't ever want to be out of your grace I don't ever want to be out of your will I'm gonna ask you to stand this evening we can say much more much when James 5 16 is talking about confess your faults one to another uh and pray for one another he said brother Branham gives us gives us this quote and I want to ask you as I'm reading it for you to follow what brother Branham is is saying this is not what I'm saying no look at your ego but this is what with the prophet of of God and of this age has showed us to do so many times when we when we need prayer we're asking Lord help me help me help me I use but many times in our dire situation in need very rarelys in our time of despairie very rarely do what you're saying give brother without his strength give sister Elsa strength give my brother Jim's strength fuers be with my sister Virginia so many times we go to God with an attitude this is now while you're praying this is if you're sick why don't you put your hand over on somebody and pray for them can you do that this evening can you get your neighbor why don't you put your hand over on somebody foreign put your hand over on one another now now you've confessed that he was now you've confessed that you was wanting the holy the holy ghost that you wanted salvation now if you want healing put your hands on one another Jesus said these signs shall shall follow them that belief Jesus if they lay
