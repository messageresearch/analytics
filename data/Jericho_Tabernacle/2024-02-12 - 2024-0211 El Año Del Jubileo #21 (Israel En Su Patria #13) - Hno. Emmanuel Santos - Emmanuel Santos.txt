receive it with [Music] joyfully we ask for all these blessings and these favors the name of Jesus Christ amen amen just like you're standing let's go to the Book of Ezekiel uh verse 30 chapter [Music] 37 we'll be reading from the uh first verse to verse [Music] 6 of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord and sent me down in the midst of the valley which was full of [Music] Bones and caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open Valley and low they were very [Music] dry and he said unto me son of a man can these bones live and I answered oh Lord God thou knowest and again he said unto me prophesy unto these bones and said unto them oh you oh ye Dry Bones hear ye the word of the [Music] Lord thus sayith the Lord God unto these bones behold I cause breath onto enter into you and you shall live and I will lay sin news upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and you shall live and you shall know that I am the Lord now verse 11 [Music] then he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of Israel behold they say our bones are dried and our hope is lost we are cut off for our parts therefore prophesy and say unto them thus sayith the Lord God behold all my people I will open your Graves and cause you to open up your Graves and bring you into the land of Israel and you shall know that I am the Lord and when I open your Graves all my people and brought you up out of your [Music] Graves and shall put my spirit in you and you shall live and I shall place you in your own land then you should know that I the Lord have spoken it and performed it sayeth the Lord God bless theing of his word may be seated we also thank the musicians now in this morning I'd like to speak on the dry bones now if you read these uh verses that we just read or the first chapters that are before chapter 37 you see you find Israel that's in a pagan State and being in that Pagan situation and then God shows Israel their condition it shows it to the prophet Ezekiel and it shows that their Condition it's like a valley of dry bones and that's because they were out of their Homeland they're out of the promised land and it shows that you cannot have life if you're outside the Promised Land so then there were dry bones and they didn't have life so then they thought they had no more hope for them but yet God spoke through the prophet Ezekiel and they were restored to their Homeland and then being restored back to their Homeland They will receive life just like you when you find yourself in a valley a valley is a low Point uh speaking geographically and it's surrounded by mountains when you find yourself in a valley and it's impossible to overcome what you're being confronted with you lose all hope it doesn't matter God can still restore so the same thing that happened to Israel in the natural they find themselves in different nations and then being in different nations they didn't have life also the God's people were different denominations and God had to take them out of those denominations and take them to their Homeland which is God's word and being in God's word they can have eternal life so the restoration of the word is what produces life brother Ram says in the message restoration of the Bright Tree prophesy son of man can these bones live I wish we had time I got to wrote down here but I have to miss that prophesy can these bones live what's the four stages of that coming forth of that church what's the fourth stage of ezekiel's dry bones coming forth but the life only come not when the sinu skin was on them but when the wind blowed upon them that's when come back that fourth message of Life have you gone and you study that message of the restoration of the bright tree and here we're talking about the restoration of the dry bones and brother R is talking about how that uh that tree of life that bride tree had four meses of death they began to eat off that tree so then life brother Ram says came back to the life back to the roots when we see a tree here in the natural especially in this winter time we it finds like the tree is dead and it seems like there's no way of coming back to life so then so when when uh Springtime comes then life comes again the same thing happened with this tree in the spiritual now the four messengers of death they began to eat off that tree in the first the four stages of of the church ages but brother Bram says just like there were four messagers of death there were four messagers of life that God sent to restore that that back that tree and brother Ram also compares the the restoration of the tree of the restoration of the dry bones and brother Ram says what are the four stages of the dry bones of Ezekiel if you notice the first stage is justification under Luther which is the fifth Church age which is the sinus Wesley the second is Wesley sanctification and it's the sixth Church age and that's the flesh the third it's the Pentecostals it's the uh the the age of laa which is the restoration of the gifts now many get confused they believe the restoration of the gifts is the is the restoration of Ezekiel my brother says that's not it and then the fourth it is the eighth age where life comes because number eight is the is the number of number of Life the number of Eternity of eternal life if you can show that image so when this Cloud came introducing it spiritually not physically not literally an eigh age but spiritually it takes us to an eternal age because the bones had to be restored the body had to be restored it had to receive life once again so when it received life it was the the restoration completed so when this cloud appear here in the United States it was photographed and it was published in a magazine you can show the next image it was published in this magazine called life life now let's take a sharp turn now brother compares the dry bones of Ezekiel Phoenix like the City of Phoenix this very same city I'm going to read several quotes so you can understand it and the first uh message the uh the believer the position of a believer in Christ he says let's pray Heavenly Father we we love you take us under your care God this lovely little church here oh I see them scattered everywhere like a sheep without a Shepherd just like Ezekiel Saw that Valley of Bones being scattered all over the valley uh Born Again children they love you Lord with all their heart father somehow get a hold of their hearts Pho and may there be an oldfashioned hungry for God break out across Phoenix till there be a Revival that sweep from the South Mountain to the north Mountains from the East to the west and this Valley the Maricopa Valley and this Valley will become illuminated with the glory and power of God as every Church coming together like ezekiel's dry bones May the sin skin and flesh rise upon the church as we go in the name of the Lord Jesus you can see that Ezekiel God showed him a valley full of dry bones and here in Phoenix live in the valley of Maricopa okay and the message experiences now this in the in the uh year 47 uh just a little while after he found himself with the angel and the angel sent them forth to go send for bring forth a Revival Phoenix has been the hardest that I have ever had yet the smallest crowds that ever attended and so forth Phoenix has been Phoenix Phoenix it's the city that I love above all cities in the world is Phoenix I love it and that I want to be I want this to be my home someday and that's why Satan fights me so hard here that that's right but with God's grace I'll win and I shall have what I've asked for by God's grace Phoenix and what I want to see in Phoenix and I'm just going to pray that God do it because I want to see the churches all in Phoenix like they was up in the nor Northwestern territory all in one heart one Accord and one place in the year 62 unbelief does not hinder God the prophet says and we're so happy to be here today in this fine atmosphere of worship and I appreciate so much the attendance of these churches since we've been in this city and throughout the Maricopa Valley such a wonderful Fellowship I said the other day I think that the word Phoenix something that's come out of nothing now that might be the wrong expression but I think something on that order that this city was built a desert here just right in the middle of the desert so it rose up out of the chaos and a few years ago I came into this city some 10 or 15 years ago and then the churches was kind of battling with each other you could hardly get they said well if this group is going to do the cooperation we're out pH so I see I find out there's another Phoenix has rose up such a Brotherhood of Fellowship among the Brethren all the churches together and in the message forsaking all speaking about Phoenix once again this is a beautiful country I I I found this kind of a outstanding that he said this I don't think there's anything like it that I've ever seen and I travel pretty near every nation in the world and never seen nothing in Europe Italy Asia anywhere in the orients Phoenix they ever compared with Phoenix Arizona that's right it's the most beautiful place I've ever saw but oh it will look like an alley up in the side of what what would be in that great Millennium I don't know why brother brandham says phix that's Phoenix the most beautiful city and if we live here and it it's so hot 11 months out of the year but that's what he says the message the angel of God father I thank thee for this another privilege for this evening for the third trip to this lovely little city of Phoenix or the Valley of the Sun where my heart has yearned to be since a little boy oh God somehow I pray God that you'll start us a Revival in every Church there in the city Grant it Lord May a great moving Revival come to this city and the message the second coming we thank thee for the opportunity that we have for meeting here in this great City sitting here in the desert Phoenix by the name of Phoenix something that's raised up out of chaos and we pray father right in this great city that you raised up out of the chaos of generation of a generation a marvelous Church of the Living God fill with the spirit anointed Great Men of God may come from this city proclaiming the message around the world and the Harvest time I said what a time now that's been about 12 14 years ago Phoenix now it's in the city called Phoenix Phoenix Phoenix is something that's built built from the ruins I said well that same thing happened to you this morning God built you up I believe this morning from a ruined Health to a good health and then Mage the Paradox then my first meeting M I'm gonna preach here is in Phoenix Arizona is at Phoenix Arizona Phenix Phoenix is something that can raise out of nothing that's what God does he takes nothing raises something out of it we read all these quotes so you can see what brother Bram says Phoenix of the City of Phoenix Phoenix and what Phoenix uh means there's an image that I want to show this is an image that I found from a young man I believe from Mexico years back and I got my attention I want you to see it now once again in the Quast that we just read how many you know that Phoenix is a bird okay Phoenix means something that has come out of nothing pH Phoenix is also something that's raised up out of chaos Phoenix is something that's built up from the ruins and so when God takes Ezekiel and he sees the Valley of the dry bones they're in that condition like the Phoenix in chaos ruins and they come to be nothing but nevertheless God speaks to the prophet and asks him the question and one might think this is the prophet Ezekiel this man already had fellowship with God and he might know that for God there's nothing impossible but when God speaks to Ezekiel he's ask him can these bones live again and one might think that his response might be sure God you can do all things but Ezekiel said seeing the scene that was before him only Lord you know and that's how many of us are in that condition we've already had fellowship with God we've already seen in the past what he has done now we're in a valley in our spiritual life and we don't know if we can come out of it Phoenix I also got in the uh the website there in Phoenix of why they chose this name Phoenix now this is from the web page from Phoenix history of the city of the bird history of the city bird the City of Phoenix was given its name by its Founders because it sprung up from the ruin of from its former civilization that had vanished into history as a result the phoenix bird became the official City symbol the myth the phoenix bird symbolizes immortality the resurrection life after death and in ancient Greek and and Egyptian mythology it is associated with the sun god according to the Greeks the bird lives in Arabia near a cool well every morning at dawn the son God will stop his Chariot to listen to the bird sing a beautiful song while it bathed in the well only one Phoenix exist at a time so when the bird felt its death was near every 500 to4 1,461 years it would build a nest of aromatic wood and set it on fire then the bird was consumed by the flames a new Phoenix sprang from the from the p and inolved the ashes of his predecessor in an egg of myr and flew with the hopos in the city of the sun where the egg was deposited in the altar of the sun god in Egypt it was us usually depicted as a heron but in classic literature as a peacock or an eagle but now why did I read that it speaks about this bird this associated with a Greek and Egyptian mythology now we don't believe in those things we believe in the Bible we believe in the message but that there is a truth that exists Pho about the Phoenix but throughout time they have taken that and they plac their own interpretations to bring forth their own religions phix but just because the Phoenix because it in the uh the culture of the Greek doesn't mean it has nothing to do with us and a good example about this it's in Acts 17 here's Paul now he goes to a specific place in Greece acts 175 and they that conducted Paul brought him onto Athens and receiving a commandment onto Silas and tootus for to come to him with all speed they departed now while Paul waited for them at Athens his Spirit was stirred in him when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews and with the devote persons and in the market daily with them that met with him and the certain philosopher of the epicureans and of the stoics and conjured him and said some said what will this babbler say others some he seeth to be said set her forth of strange Gods because he preached onto them Jesus and the resurrection and they took him and brought him onto erag saying may we know what this new doctrine whereof thou speakest is for th bring us certain strange things to our ears we would know therefore what these things mean for all the for all the atheen for the strangers which were there spent their time and nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing then Paul stood in the midst of Mars Hill and said ye men of Athens I perceive that in all things you're too superstitious now in English it says the word superstitious now Superstition is meaning something crazy for as I passed by and behold your devotions I found an altar with this inscription to the unknown God whom therefore you ignorantly worship him I declare unto you you can see that Paul he's he's with the Greek people and these people they have an altar of a God that they don't know and they worship Him so they can see that they have a part of the truth but not all the truth pH the same thing is applied to the to Phoenix it's part of Greek mythology but it also has something to do with us so how can we separate of what is Greek mythology and what belongs to us and that is by the Revelation that's in the Bible and in the message because the Phoenix let me tell you it's in the Bible it's in the Bible the message he cares do you care says we're at the end and we see see we're at the end there's no way to build upon that corruption how can we build a city Upon A charred ruins of a Sodom and Gomorrah remember that Sodom and gomor was also found in a valley and a place geographically where they were at it reflected their spiritual state they were they were uh beneath or or drowned in sin it says how can we do this there's only one Phoenix left and that's the coming of the Lord Jesus Oh My a purification through the tribulation period to bring back a restoring of a world for a people who are just in the sight of God and live by his word now we want to see Phoenix in the Bible right now this is in Malachi 4:1 I just finished saying that Phoenix it is the coming of the Lord now in verse one for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud and and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayeth the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither nor root nor Branch pH now here's the Phoenix go ahead but unto you that that fearth my name shall the son of righteousness arise and with his wings will bring healing and you shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall now this bird was a bird associated with the sun now our our Phoenix is the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and he is our son of righteousness but he also has wings like in both languages it says and and on one languages it says healing in his wings and the other language it says he brings salvation in his wings and when that bird comes to die it turns into ashes it becomes nothing verse three and you should tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this sayeth the Lord of hosts now you can see Phoenix it is in the Bible but not in the way that the world brings it now in Greek mythology because that's a pagan belief but just because it's a pagan belief doesn't mean there's no truth in it better yet brother Bram teaches that that Catholic Doctrine when they baptize in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost that that is a pagan teaching but in that teaching there is a truth because Jesus himself said go and go bring disciples baptizing them in the father Son and the Holy Ghost but the Catholic church does not have the Revelation that's the name of the father Son and the Holy Ghost it's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ just because they have have a pagan teaching I'm going to throw it away there's truth in it but it's by the Revelation that you know what is the truth and what's not the truth the same thing with Phoenix now once again Ezekiel he sees the valy of the dry bones and God interprets to him what this means in Ezekiel 3711 then he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of Israel behold they say our bones are dried and this is the the portion where I want you to focus on and our hope is lost now them humanly speaking they didn't have no they no longer had hope to be restored and that's how the Church of the Living God just like paganism entered the church with a teachings of erroneous things that took away the life to the from the tree in this case the bones and it seemed like there was no longer hope for God's word to produce eternal life in their children but what's impossible for man for God is not impossible so they say they thought they believe their Hope was lost but yet again they were restored but that is a faith and Romans 4:17 as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him who he had believed even God who quickened the dead and call those things which is not as though they were Verse 18 notice who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be so Abraham received the promise that he received the promise in his old age when humanly it was impossible for him to have kids but God told him you're going to receive a child and you should be father of many nations and father of Faith but in the time where God calls Abraham humanly it was it was impossible there was no longer hope for him to have a son but did that stop God of course it didn't but when hope is lost that's when you're begin to use this Faith verse 19 and I'm sorry and not and being not weak in his faith he considered not his own body now dead being not being this body now dead now notice how Abraham's body was he was now dead and and Ezekiel Saw the valley of dry bones The Human Condition The Human Condition it tells you there's no more hope but the faith of Abraham it tells you it tells you can be done it is possible but hope it only has a certain limit but the faith of Abraham doesn't see the human hope doesn't see The Human Condition they see God's promise shall these bones live again of course they can can I have a son of course you can when all hope is lost one should use the faith and believe on what to believe to believe what you believe is more real it's more true and believe your situation in that moment is a lie the brother says in the message God's covenant with Abraham and his seed Abraham believed God he never thought of reasonings he never he never thought of the matter without now the Mind reasons but Faith believes it anyhow Faith don't look the Bible said against hope he believed in Hope when there was not even a hope he still believed anyhow and it was imputed to him for righteousness and if you don't have that kind of Faith you're not Abraham's seed now the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed oh how I wish I had time to go back into Ezekiel and pull out them dry bones show you and he said Can these bones live again he said prophesy how can prophecy come only through the prophet it's the word of the Lord hear ye Dry Bones the word of the Lord and Senus came and skin Came Upon them and they stood up a mighty Army now notice this they started in a valley in the Valley of the dry bones and they began to March toward Zion where is Zion it's up in the mountain from their their bottom condition you should be restored to the most highest point now brother when he speaks about Ezekiel said Ezekiel prophesied he say only prophecy comes to the prophet and he says in the message the anointed ones at the end time no no more there's no more higher order to reveal the word notice there's no more higher order now God's word throughout the ages it's in a valley of dry bones but Ezekiel prophesied and turned into an army that was marching to Zion now here the Prophet Elijah it shows us here throughout the ages that the age was was in the same condition but we have reached the fourth stage where life comes in there's no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word remember now here's the faith of Abraham the third pool was opening them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word I want you to know what brother Bram says that throughout the Revelation that we're in the fourth stage of the dry bones of Ezekiel that's when life comes in and when Phoenix comes in he brings salvation and healing in his wings he said it was the third pool that opened the Seven Seals but he also when I said that a humble little woman the first time this ever happened the third pool upon a human being was a little humble woman so the same Faith the same power to open up the seals that was in his highest point that it shows us we're in the highest point in God's word it was the same power with the same power that was used on sister hat Wright pH and it's the faith of a phoenix because Phoenix means that you're in a valley you could be in ruins in chaos your life turned to be nothing Satan has won you over there's no way you can come out of this pH that is what Phoenix represents that even though you find yourself in that low situation without any hope without exit humanly speaking then God restores you out of that condition he takes you out of there he brings you out phix so that faith of Phoenix it's in the Bible now let's let's demonstrate it in Matthew 15:22 like I said we we know and I believe we studed some of the message the third po it's creative power it's a spoken word it's the revelation of the seals it's life now in Matthew 15 verse 22 behold the woman out of Canaan of Canaan came out on the same coast and cried out him saying have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil you see the Revelation sometimes between the lines verse 23 but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and beside him saying send her away for she cry crith after us but he answered and said I am not sent I not have sent but unto the lost sheep of the House of Israel the first quot that we wear from Brother Bram Phoenix when he Compares Ezekiel to Phoenix Pho the children of God that's in Phoenix it's dispersed throughout this whole city it's talk about the lost sheep of the House of [Music] Israel and when God shows Ezekiel in the condition of the valley this is the condition of the House of Israel verse 25 then she came and worshiped him saying Lord help me but he answered and said it is not meat to take the children's bread and cast it into the dog and she said truth Lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the master's table then Jesus answered said unto her oh woman great is thy faith be unto thee as thou Wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour Phoenix now we're talking about the faith of Phoenix in M no in Matthew it speaks that she came out of Canaan now we know that the four Gospels it talks about the same story but but different points of views now Matthew says she came out of Canaan but in Mark 7:25 say for a certain woman whose young daughter had an unclean Spirit heard of him and came and fell at his feet Pho now remember Phoenix was part of Greek mythology we see that there is a truth found in there verse 26 the woman was a Greek and a Ser ofation by Nation you see the word phoenix in there Phoenix the the name of Phoenix here in this city was taken from out of that region there of of of of Phoenician so this woman who was a c phenician used the faith of the Phoenix faith of God of the spoken word and she was a pagan and she besought him that he will cast forth the devil out of her daughter Jesus said unto her let Let The Children First be filled for it's not meat to take the children's bread and cast it onto the dogs and she answered them yes yet the dogs under the table eat of the crumbs of the children crumbs and he said H for this saying go thy way the devil has gone out of thy daughter so the faith of Phoenix was used by a certain phenician was the power of the spoken word now woman was a pagan it speaks of how God in the dry bones that the Israel was in paganism God's Al God's people's also the bride throughout the ages were in in Pagan teachings but God was going to restore them God was going to take them out of paganism and it was a pagan that used this power to restore the the condition of daughter cenia C phenician it means a native or inhabitant of Phoenicia when it was a part of the Roman province of Syria in the message the uh the availing of God brother Ram says says look at that cenan woman who run to him and said thou son of David have mercy on me he never as much rais his head she had no claims on him as a son of David she was a gentile no more than my daughter has claims on me as a husband or my wife as a daughter yet she is my daughter and my wife wife she's my daughter in the gospel but Earthly she has no rights to call me a father but notice this Gentile woman had no claims on him as son of David But Blind barus but did see he was a Jew now he comes as son of man you have to know these words and these things look at had right that time when the third pool you remember it of all of everything that woman said the right thing you got to say that right word the right thing to God so you can see so the human condition of har R it's in a valley says speak to this mountain there said her crippled sister her aged father she was poor she could ask for money and financially she would find herself in a valley but financially she was barely able to make it and she gave part of her money to the renov the renovation of the brandham Tabernacle and brother Ram wanted to return that money back to sister hadie but it was in that moment that God revealed to brother Bram I remember her remember him in that passage in the Bible there was a widow woman that went to the house of God and gave the little of what she had forgive me she gave much of what she had that much for her might be little for us it was a little money for us but that was the much that she had what you s it might seem small you're you're going to reap what you sow and the faith of the third pole is the rap the rapturing faith it's the latter rain and the latter rain is the is the Harvest the pick the reaping time now she sold in God to give God what everything that she had even though she was in her low condition and she reaped or picked up the Harvest there in the third pool and being found in a valley she was now in the mountain to receive the salvation of her two children she could have asked for anything she wanted to I said ask anything that's in your heart anything you want to you ask it and thus sayith the Lord I'll speak it behind you and you have it she said the salvation of my two boys says you have it in the name of the Lord notice that the condition of these two Bo they were in a valley there was no human hope for them to be saved and those two little modern teenage snickle frits boys that they hated the very cause of Christ they grabbed one another and began to scream the blessings of God the power of God struck that place Banks fell in his plate I don't know what happened about 10 minutes now remember how does prophecy come forth how does the restoration come forth by the prophet Ezekiel now here for me is a prophecy that the prophet is bringing forth friends you realize what that was I had never felt in my life such an anointing the first time it was ever performed in a human being it bypassed the aristocrats bypassed everything else and it went to a little poor little old widow woman living up in the hill there and God know what she was to ask her boys were G gloriously saved the very minute it was spoken if she would have asked for $10,000 it had been given onto her if she would ask for the sister's healing it'd be given to her I I believe the Church of the Living God now is moving into a sphere now that's going to shake the whole world that's the first time it's been since the days of Jesus of Nazareth to a human being ask anything that you will and it should be given unto you anything you desire don't you see the words of Jesus Christ being fulfilled oh it's going to come come to pass pretty soon I'm looking for it to happen in this meeting I'm want to happen it now that that anointing will strike the whole church and she will rise to her feet like a mighty Army marching she wants that he wants that anointing to come to the church and to turn into a mighty Army of God in Ezekiel 37 and still in the Valley of the bones God tells Ezekiel verse 9 he he me prophesy unto the spirit onto the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus sayith the Lord God come from the Four Winds oh breath and breathe upon these slain and they may live so I prophesied as he commanded me and breath came into them and they lived and they stood upon their feet now know what it says here an exceeding great Army the faith of the third pool Phoenix is the faith of Phoenix they can restore any condition it's the faith that God used for the world when it was there empty and without order it was the same faith that he used for the dry bones to restore his own word that they lost life throughout the ages and it's the same faith that God used and gave brother brandham to speak to the squirrels and gave salvation to the two boys nothing's impossible for God there's no more hope there is no more hope but that doesn't matter God doesn't want to see your Human Condition he doesn't want to see your condition that's around you God only wants you to believe in him and he's going to take care of the [Applause] rest now we're in that age when that Faith was used now the key is now don't put your faith in the Earthly in your Human Condition and what's happening at the moment there's no exit there's no solution for you there isn't but for God there is notice how was that faith that God used to restore the dry bones of Ezekiel to restore that body R says in the fifth the fifth seal I believe I'm not going to speak it speak it in his name but I'm going to speak it in my in the revelation of my faith what happened in Sabino Canyon the other day I believe that the hour is approaching when the missing limbs will be restored and the glorious power of the Creator if God used that Faith to restore the body of Israel God he can he can also use that Faith to restore his body the body that you have it doesn't matter the situ sitation if you're the Seed of Abraham you don't have to fear the third pool you're supposed to believe or depend on that third pole and part of that third pole is the revelation of God's word if God revealed it that you're not sick that you don't have cancer you don't have the spirit upon you then believe it it doesn't matter what your body tells you it doesn't matter what the devil the devil tells you even though there's no more human hope but you speak what God revealed to you and keep going on like a like an army marching onto Zion now the third pool now it is the the Supreme omnipotence of God it's the greatest power he has you may you may understand says and the the patmas vision says man is omnipotent so you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent did he not say in Mark 11:22 whatsoever the things you say don't doubt in your heart it'll come to pass you can have what you said now the thing about us and when we tell the mount to move we think that the whole mountain is going to move but brother R says when you tell the mountain to move it says a small grain a small rock begins to fall from the mountain and if you study the earthquakes it requires from one rock to be thrown to start an earthquake you want the mount to move believe God doesn't matter what you see speak to that that unclean spirit and it seems like that Spirit doesn't leave you God will begin begin to weaken the power of that Spirit through the power the third pool what happens when two omnipotents meet when God and man comes together two omnipotents something's got to shake whatever you say with that creative power of omnipotence of God knowing that he got knowing that he promised it he said in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and bring things to pass now see that's the faith of Abraham things that is not it makes them as they they were because two omnipotents have met let us let us bow our heads now remember God's going to take you to that Valley God's going to take you to that condition you will no longer have a way out you won't have no more of a solution so you yourself can discover the omip omnipotence that's in you it's the seed of Faith that's in your heart it seems like nothing's going on you keep believing God we're in that age everything shows that we're there begin to believe it with the omnipotence that's in your heart and God omnipotent and you'll see the unip that you have he's reflecting it brother says the words that har wght said were the words that God gave her to say so Heavenly Father help us in this morning possibly human humanly speaking we don't understand why we're in these conditions we don't want to be in these conditions we believe there's many in the lives of the people here that have struggled this for years and they don't find a way out they don't find the solution but the solution is already in them we just it just needs desperation to surrender to God to use the omnipotence to reflect the Life of Christ Christ is savior and Christ spoke about har right about salvation we speak of this Lord that your people come to a maturity that they don't fear the third pole but but they embrace it help us Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
