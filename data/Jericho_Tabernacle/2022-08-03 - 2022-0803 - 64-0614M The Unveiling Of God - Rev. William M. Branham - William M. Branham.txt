TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you you this message the unveiling of god by brother william marion branham was delivered on sunday morning june 14 1964 at the branham tabernacle in jeffersonville indiana usa hermano william marion branham foreign let us remain standing just a moment while we bow our heads for prayer permanent our gracious lord we are indeed grateful today for this privilege that we have of assembling ourselves together upon the earth before the coming of the lord. may we examine our hearts today by thy word and see if we are in the faith that we might be ready that the hour of his appearing that we should be as the scripture has said would be caught up together with those who are asleep and meet the lord in the air and forever be with him yes we thank thee for the true christian spirit that's still in the world among the people that they still believe thee and i word so we asked your blessings upon us today that you'll shout out to each one of us that which we have need of that we might be watered by the word that we might grow into instruments of use in thy hands for this last day for we ask this in the name of the lord jesus christ our great shepherd that we are looking to appear amen says and i want to say that i deemed this a grand privilege this morning of being here again and sorry that we don't have the adequate seating room and we are going to try tonight now to have prayer for the sick. today this morning it would be a little hard and and i was going to tape this message today the lord seemed to deal with me concerning it all a month or two ago and it's along respect he is largo and i don't have the time out in the meetings because we allow that to 30 40 minutes of service and is we uh because of the people having to go to work and things i found it better if i make my messages short entonces nosotros and they didn't have time out there to record it so i thought i'd just wait till i got to the tabernacle here and then record it from here on time and it's a little lengthy and i know you're standing and i i'm going to hurry just as fast as i can and now you won't bother me if you switch in seats or whatever more that'll that'll be perfectly all right with me because this is a special day that we just make these recordings special and so we got great reports from what the lord has done out in the field but we'll probably give more of that tonight when we can give more time to it have more time to give and now we trust that the lord will bless each one of you i know your hearts are full of joy looking for the coming of the lord and mine also bubbling over to see things happening the way they are and national strife and the church in the condition it's in and see the signs of his coming both physically and spiritually nationalism and knowing that this time of his appearing is so close it just fills our heart with joy to know that we're going to be changed one of these days we're going to be changed in these creatures that we are is implementing now i believe if i understand they got a telephone or hookup somewhere this message is going into phoenix and to uh and to different parts by telephone aura apart and so now we trust that if that's so i don't know i just told that for coming in and all the people out there are really enjoying good health and and the glory of the lord upon them and now now we're going to open the word of the lord and what we are all here for is to enjoy ourselves and to take heed to what we are it is we never come here and we're no one that's present knows that any man was set in this heat like this and just to the idea of being here amen that's all we can do is to believe the lord jesus is with us and we're here to to walk closer with him now this heat's a little hard on me i kind of got customized to that dry heat out there in tucson which is uh the humidity here now our heat there is much hotter than this but uh it's uh dry hora our humidity sometime is one twentieth of one percent maybe something like that just almost like living under an oxygen tent but here it's got the moisture in it and it makes you just kind of feel all rung out as we used to so it's uh hard on him so i know that and you mothers are the little babies and you people standing old and young and placed together like you are in tonses and now we're we're hoping that god will reward you richly for your sacrifice i understand that brother roy borders is here somewhere i heard him announce but i guess maybe he couldn't get in tending all right that's the manager of the meetings administrators now we are also want to announce that one that used to be among us uh went to be with the lord this morning a man brother jackson from sturgis michigan no one knows how it went or what about it he was just doing fine and it just i think they found him dead or something i didn't get the full detail of it and we are very grateful to god that brother jackson was a christian yes i haven't seen him for several years but he set among us and he's one of us god rest his gallant souls going like that we believe that maybe that it was something that it was time for him to go well the lord never warned us of it or him just and we all want to give thanks to god for his gallant christian life and what he meant here on earth and especially to us here tonight i announced there will be prayer for the sick tonight and i'll speak more about on the sick tonight but for this time let's get straight into the word now because it's uh congested and hot we'll get right straight to the work director i want to read from two portions of scripture this morning lengthy so that it'll give me a little background on what i want and now i wish that they would hold the tape brother softman and them before selling it if possible and i'd like to listen to it before we before it goes out to the public spot now and i want to read from philippians the second chapter one to eight hours and ii corinthians 3 beginning with six and reading into the fourth chapter of second corinthians just for a background now in philippians uh second chapter i will read first before reading let's pray lord jesus the word is truth senor jesus and in this troublesome hour that we're living nation against nation pestilence earthquakes in many places man's hearts failing fear we see the handwriting on the wall now that is in the natural realm that all the world should see this but now there is a spiritual realm also and we see the great happenings and we want to speak of them today bless our word to our heart we know that there's no man in heaven or in earth is worthy to take this book to lose the seals are to look up on it even but there was one appeared a slaying lamb bloody that came and took the book and was worthy and able to open it oh lamb of god open thy word to our hearts today for comfort and consuelo we are your servants forgive our sins anything that would keep the word from going forth with great power and influence today on our lives take it away lord any hindrance that we might have full access to all the blessings promised to us through thy word influenza we asked it in jesus name amen lopez jesus amen philippians 2 philippines if there be therefore any consolation in christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any vowels of mercy algun consuelo di amoros espiritu fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded having the same love being a one a card of one mind completed let nothing be done through strife or vain glory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem the other better than themselves look not every man to his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which also was in christ jesus jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no repetitions and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of man and being found in fashion of a man he humbled himself and became obedient to death even the death of the cross now if we shall turn now over to second corinthians the third chapter we will begin with the sixth verse and reading this to the 18th and down to part of the fourth chapter who also has made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life but if the administration of death written and engraved in stones was glorious so that the children of israel could not steadfast behold the face of moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to be done away from how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious bien con gloria ministerio del espiritu for if the ministration of condemnation be glorious much more does the administration of righteousness exceed in glory for question or even that which was made glorious has no glory in this respect by reasons of the glory that excelif or if that which is done away was gloria much more hath which remaineth his glory gloria mucho mas glorioso seeing then that we have such a hope we must uh greatly plainness of speech use great plainness of speech and not as moses which put a veil over his face that the children of israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which was abolished but they're minds were blinded for until this day remains the same veil untaken away in the reading of the old testament which baal is done away in christ but even unto this day when moses is read the veil is upon their hearts he says when it shall be turned to the lord the veil shall be taken away now the lord is that spirit and we're the spirit of the lord there is liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord has changed into the same image from glory unto glory even as by the spirit of the lord gloria del signor transformative glory and glory therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy we faint not record see hidden things and the dishonest not walking and craftiness and handling the word of god deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth condemning ourselves to every man's conscience in the side of god manifestation but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them which are lost [Music] may the lord add his blessings to the reading of his word now my subject this morning i trust that god will reveal this and each time if you who take the tapes and listen and i hope and trust that that you have had a spiritual understanding of what that god has been if trying to get over to the church without saying it right out see us we have to say things in such a way that it might thin down it might bring some to go out some to leave and some to to to ponder over manera but that's done purposely it must be done that way peru then it might be that some would say you mean god would purposely do a thing like that says he said one day when he had thousands around him he said uh except you eat of the flesh of the son of god a son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you until comes what kind of a statement do you think that a medical doctor or nurse or any fine intellectual person would think of a statement like that for a man that had a ministry like he had declaration intellectual declaration el ministerio why he would say eat the flesh that's cannibal to drink human blood it's a vampire comedy in other words he wants us to be cannibals and vampires and the whole audience walked away from him and there was a ministerial association with him of 70 that have been chosen and he turned to them and he said uh what will you think when you see the son of man ascending up from where he came from now he didn't explain that he never explained how paul did that later on he just said it no he said what will you say to these ministers when you see the son of man ascending up from where he come from no doubt that man said now just a moment oh we eat with him we fish with him we sleep with him oh no we know where he was born we've seen the cradle that he he was rocked in and uh how does this man this is a hard saying and the bible said they didn't walk with him anymore they left him john van daven connell you chose 12 and one of them was the devil he said you know so he turned how are they going to eat his flesh and drink his blood and they turned to the apostles he said uh do you want to go also and that's when the apostle peter made that great statement lord to whom would we go ahead or we are satisfied we know surely that you and you alone have the word of life of this house and we're satisfied of that concern you can't explain faith it's something that you believe and it's so solid that there's nothing else will take its place therefore they know that the word that was written for that age that they were living in the messiahic age that he fit that place exactly in this and what could they do to go back in them coal formal churches that they come out of iglesias said where would we go and they they couldn't explain it but they believed it and jesus said that to weed down his crown see so he could get the group together and out of all those people they only have 11 of them then understood actually who he was now my subject this morning is to reveal or unveil that god aura is god has always in every age has hid behind the veil all ages but he's been god all the time but he's kept himself hid from the world and reveals himself to his elected like the apostles at that day embargo del mundo is now that was god's speaking in christ now man has always it's been the nature of man he sought to see physically that god is and we found in africa different forms of animals and so forth in africa different animals see the mass then up the totem poles in alaska and and different farms that they think this god is in yeah in alaska just paul spoke there at athens that time on mars hill and i told him if they were superstitious concerning this unknown god that they know he was there but yet they didn't know him and uh so we find even back as far as job job knew that there was a god he knew it yeah [Music] and there's not a a human being in their right mind but what knows there's got to be something somewhere in existence i want you to notice the form that god chose to talk to job god was veiled when he talked to jobs you believe that god still comes there's several settings here a number that was with us the other day when he came in a whirlwind ibario sentados told us the day before brother banks woodstown when he said take up this rock throw it up in the air and say thus saith the lord you will see it right away and i picked up the rock up on top of the mountain threw it up in the air and the course coming down it started to whirlwind see the suction of it is you have to do something to call something to follow it jesus took a piece of bread and broke it then multiplied from that piece of bread jesus he took water poured it into a pitcher agua elijah tucked salt put it in a cruise cut down a stick throw it on the water elias and picking up this rock and throwing it into the air and coming down started the whirlwind the next day while there was a minister with us on a hunting trip aldia siguiente he was standing close and uh he said to me does the lord give visions out like this brother branham and just then the vision came in brother borders i think he's outside now he was along borders brother banks woods i think in several was up there eight or ten hermano banks woods yes and brother banks wood's watching for this right on the mountain right across from exactly about one half mile where the seven angels appeared that i left here to go there for uh come back and told the about the seven seals hermano banks woods is just about a half a mile from then and then the next day when this was going on while the uh i said to brother this brother i said what's your trouble you've got an allergy in your eye the doctors has tried for a couple years to stop it and they can't do and i said but don't worry the lord jesus has honored your faith and he just dropped his gun jesus implemented and i said your mother just what she was and what was wrong with her and he said that's the truth brother roy roberson from the church here standing present i guess all of you know him knowing he was a veteran and knowing what was going to take place i put my hand on his shoulder i said brother roberson be careful watch something's fixing to happen i walked back to where i was supposed to be standing and out of the air came a whirlwind down to a canyon from above that was so great until it tore rocks eight or ten inches of through out of the top of the mountain and threw them 200 yards out in regression and clapped three times like that and a voice came from all of them standing there brother banks present now came up so that was what you told me yesterday i said yes sir that's it he said uh what did it say i said now that's just for me to know brother banksy because a little few days later it hit in the ocean and you see what happened around fairbanks it was a judgment sign used now we find that that god still uh you see throw people into panics and so then they had that had to happen see it just has to happen the things that's got to happen got to happen anyhow it's going to happen anyhow moses one time desired to see god and god told him to stand on the rock certainly it moses stood and his scene god passed by and his back looked like the back of a man we said i guess you all see the picture out there the other day we stood by that same rock photography and here's that light the age of the lord right there jehovah of the old testament is jesus of the new testament jesus is the same god just changed in his form now someone said the other day a baptist minister out in tucson how can you say that jesus and god would be the same person i said well it's very easy if you just let your own thinking get away and think the bible terms of it they are the self-same being god is a spirit jesus is the body that he was bailed in i said like in my home to my wife i am her husband i have a young daughter rebecca i am her father and i have a grandson and his name is paul i am his grandfather is paul i am husband father and grandfather and my wife has no claims on me as father or grandfather she has claims on me alone as a husband and my daughter has no claims on me as husband or grandfather she is my child see me hey that's god father son and holy ghost is just the dispensation claims on manifestations god is saying the same god has if you notice your philippines he said not thinking it a robbery but tuck the form of man now the greek word there for that form i've been looking at it all day yesterday trying to think out what it was i find come with this word of a mafia is [Applause] i may pronounce that wrong but that reason i spell it whether the tape is released their people scholars will know what a i mean is that means that he changed his self he calmed down morphe now the greek word there means that something that could not be seen yet it's there and then it's changed and the eye can catch it like elijah was a dolphin see the the servant couldn't see all those angels around there and god just changed not brought the angels down but he changed the seeing of the servant los angeles and there was the mountains full of angels and fire and horses of fire chariots of fire all around his prophet establishment [Music] the thing is already there so that what i'm trying to say that god that always was is here the only thing he'd done when he become man he changed his mask he changed himself to what he was to what he is or his masked like in a great drama as i was uh speaking this morning kind of catching up on this of shakespeare it's been a long time actually shakespeare pasado mucho tiempo but when shakespeare wrote the the the drama the uh for a king james of england when he uh the character of macbeth pero quando see shakespeare did not believe in witches but uh uh in the play for the king did believe in witches so he had to include witches see beyonce [Music] and and now in order to do this they changed the cast becky here uh and carmen they acted that in the and the school where she just graduated a few weeks ago now maybe one person played three or four parts in order to do that he changed his mask sometimes he comes out he's this character and the next time he comes out he's another character but it is the same person all the time he changed himself from from a pillar fire to become a man then change himself from that back into spirit again that he might dwell in man god acting in man what he really was doing jesus christ was god acting in man in a man jesus christ it changed from the pillar of fire and then it come in which was a veil in the wilderness that hid god from israel israel moses seen the shape of his body but really he was hid all the time behind this pillar of fire which was the logos that went from god moises now we find here now since pentecost god is not acting uh in man or act and how he's acting through man he was acting in a man-man jesus now is acting through man that he is chosen for this purpose god in the form of man he changed himself from the form of of us of god to a form of man. he came in three names three sons names he came in the son name of the son of of man the son of david and the son of god three sons names i want to sing that just a moment real quietly in worship have thine own way lord have thine own way hold over my being absolute sway mow make me after thy will why i'm waiting yield it in still all together now in a way of worship have that own way now

for answering her prayers and also for the group of elderly sisters that are always in prayer for the needs of the people contest it's something that's not in vain god can even see the elderly sisters that are putting in their own part just like one time jesus was at the temple and he saw that this elderly woman just gave a little bit of money but that's all she had and jesus appreciated that much even more so let's give all that we have even though it's just a little bit because the lord appreciates it those are all the petitions and the thanksgivings that we have but we know that every one of us has a need and we're also thankful for the life that he has given us today and if his mercy continues come again for the next service now we can please stand we'll be praying for any petitions that
