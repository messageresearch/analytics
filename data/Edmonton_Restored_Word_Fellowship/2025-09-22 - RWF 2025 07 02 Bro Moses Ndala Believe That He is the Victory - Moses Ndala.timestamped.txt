[10:21] A last send did my Savior
[10:27] bleed and did my sovereign die?
[10:34] Would he devote that sacred
[10:40] head for such a worm as I
[10:47] at the cross at the cross where I first
[10:52] saw the light and the burdens of my
[10:56] heart rolled away.
[11:00] It was there by faith. I received my
[11:06] sight and now I am happy all the day.
[11:14] Was it for crimes that I have done? He
[11:21] groaned upon the tree.
[11:27] Amazing
[11:29] pity.
[11:30] Grace unknown and love beyond
[11:36] degree.
[11:39] At the cross, at the cross where I first
[11:44] saw the light and the burdens of my
[11:48] heart rolled away.
[11:52] It was there by faith I received my
[11:57] sight. And now I am happy all the day.
[12:05] Well might the sun in darkness hide and
[12:12] shut his glories in.
[12:17] When Christ the mighty maker died for
[12:24] man the creature sin
[12:29] at the cross at the cross where I first
[12:34] saw the light and the burdens of my
[12:38] heart rolled away.
[12:42] It was there by faith. I received my
[12:47] sight and now I am happy all the day.
[12:55] Amen. Welcome. God bless.

[13:44] Because I know.
[13:47] Yes, I know. He holds the future.
[13:55] And life is worth the livinging just
[14:01] because he lives.
[14:06] God sent his son.
[14:12] They called him Jesus.
[14:18] He came to love,
[14:23] heal, and forgive.
[14:29] He lived and died.
[14:34] You by my pardon
[14:40] and empty grave is there to prove my
[14:46] savior there.
[14:50] Because he lives,
[14:53] [Music]
[14:55] I can face tomorrow
[15:01] because he lives.
[15:06] All fear is gone
[15:11] because I know yes I know he holds the
[15:18] future
[15:22] and life is worth the living just
[15:27] because he lives.
[15:32] And then one day
[15:37] I'll cross the river.
[15:42] I'll fight life's fun.
[15:47] No war with pain.
[15:52] And then as death
[15:57] gives way to victory,
[16:02] I'll see the lights of glory. And I'll
[16:08] know he lives.

[16:53] 1297 Oh glorious victory
[16:57] [Music]
[17:05] is victory
[17:10] the day he set me free
[17:14] and made my heart
[17:18] his very throne
[17:22] my life's known No longer mine.
[17:25] I'm a prisoner of love divine.
[17:29] And now I live
[17:33] to praise his name.
[17:37] Who am I Lord?
[17:41] Who am I?
[17:44] I can see now
[17:48] who I am.
[17:52] A part of my savior,
[17:56] a part of his word.
[17:59] It's a revelation
[18:03] of who I am.
[18:07] On Calvary, he died to redeem his lost
[18:13] bride.
[18:14] The king of kings
[18:18] became my savior.
[18:22] This is good mystery
[18:25] of love expressed to me that Christ and
[18:30] I
[18:33] might be made one.
[18:37] Who am I? Lord,
[18:40] who I am?
[18:44] I can see now
[18:48] who I am.
[18:51] I'm a part of my Savior.
[18:55] I'm a part of his world.
[18:58] It's a revelation
[19:02] of who I am.
[19:07] Amen. Maybe if we sing higher, we get
[19:09] closer to God. I guess
[19:15] let's sing 11:05. I've got to make it.
[19:20] [Music]
[19:24] More than anything
[19:27] in my life, I've got to make it.
[19:33] I've got to know my name's inscribed
[19:38] in that lamb's great book of life. I've
[19:43] got to hear him say, "Well done.
[19:47] Enter in my child. You are more than
[19:52] anything
[19:54] in my
[20:02] [Music]
[20:06] possessions, great or small.
[20:10] Friends or family take them all. But
[20:15] more than anything in my life, I've got
[20:20] to make it.
[20:24] If I can run and keep the pace,
[20:29] then in heaven I'll see his face. More
[20:33] than anything in my life, I've got to
[20:38] make it.
[20:41] More than anything in my life, I've got
[20:45] to make it.
[20:48] I've got to know my name's inscribed in
[20:53] that lamb's great book of life. I've got
[20:57] to hear him say, "Well done.
[21:00] Enter in, my child. You've won more than
[21:05] anything in my life. I've got to make it
[21:12] more than fame or wealth or desire.
[21:16] More than all this world's attire. More
[21:20] than anything in my life I've got to
[21:24] make it.
[21:27] What is all I've come to know?
[21:32] Gain the world but lose my soul. More
[21:35] than anything in my life, I've got to
[21:40] make it.
[21:42] More than anything in my life, I've got
[21:47] to make it.
[21:50] I've got to know my name's inscribed in
[21:54] that lamb's great book of life. I've got
[21:58] to hear him say, "Well done."
[22:01] Enter in, my child. You've won more than
[22:05] anything in my life. I've got to make
[22:10] it.
[22:11] [Music]
[22:18] 50. There's a river of life flowing up
[22:20] from me. Maybe if you'd stand with me.
[22:24] [Music]
[22:28] There's a river of life flowing out from
[22:32] me. It makes the lame to walk and the
[22:37] blind to see.
[22:40] It opens prison doors, sets the captives
[22:45] free.
[22:47] There's a river of life flowing out from
[22:52] me. Spring up a well
[22:56] within my soul.
[22:59] Spring up a well
[23:02] and make me whole.
[23:05] Spring up, oh well,
[23:08] and give to me
[23:12] that life
[23:15] abundantly.
[23:19] Oh, there's a river of life flowing out
[23:23] from me.
[23:26] Makes the lame to walk and the blind to
[23:30] see.
[23:32] It opens prison doors, sets the captives
[23:37] free.
[23:38] There's a river of life flowing out from
[23:43] me. Spring up a well
[23:47] within my soul.
[23:50] Spring up a well
[23:53] and make me whole.
[23:56] Spring up, oh well,
[23:59] and give to me
[24:03] that life
[24:06] abundantly.
[24:10] Amen. Amen.
[24:13] There's no word request. Maybe you'll
[24:14] just bow your heads with me and we'll go
[24:15] to the Lord in prayer.

[33:29] Lord hand of praise this evening.
[33:32] Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's go to the Lord
[33:36] in prayer this evening. Father, we thank
[33:38] you for your grace and your mercy. Lord
[33:41] Jesus Christ, it's good to be in the
[33:43] house of the Lord once again and your
[33:46] presence. Father, holy ground. Father,
[33:49] we realize that you are faithful to your
[33:53] word. As you said, Father, two or three,
[33:55] wherever there will be gathered, I'll be
[33:58] amongst them. Father, we are here
[34:00] together to agree upon your word,
[34:03] Father, to worship you, to glorify your
[34:06] name, to praise you, Father, to realize,
[34:10] Father, that we we have not made
[34:13] ourselves Christians, but you made us
[34:15] Christians, Father. Lord, you bought us
[34:18] with the price that cannot be compared
[34:20] to any other money or any value that man
[34:24] can put on. As you say, the soul of a
[34:27] man, Father, is worth 10,000 worlds.
[34:30] Father Lord, you you bought our our soul
[34:33] with your own blood. Father Lord, you
[34:36] realize, oh, Father, you could put a
[34:38] price to the equivalent to your own
[34:40] life. Your own life was the souls of
[34:43] your loved ones. Father Lord, we thank
[34:45] you for that. For your grace and your
[34:47] mercy in our life that we didn't choose
[34:49] ourself, you chose us, Father. Amen.
[34:52] This evening we are here Lord to hear
[34:53] once again the word of God that will
[34:56] draw us closer to you. Father help us
[34:58] Lord to have us to make a step towards
[35:01] you. A closer stop, a closer step, a
[35:03] closer walk with you. Father, we thank
[35:06] you father that you took our shame. You
[35:08] took our unbelief. You took our past.
[35:10] You took our sins. You took, Father,
[35:12] Lord, whatever that was hindering us to
[35:15] have a close fellowship with you. You
[35:17] put that in the sea of forgetfulness to
[35:19] not remember it no more. Now we are in
[35:22] your presence, Father, as the virtuous
[35:24] bride. Father, we give you the glory and
[35:26] the honor. Father, let your name be
[35:28] praised once again. Help me, Father, to
[35:30] deliver the thought you put in my heart
[35:33] and prepare the ground in the people to
[35:35] receive it. Thank you for the song
[35:36] service. Thank you for your presence.

[40:52] one. just um it was just a good comment
[40:55] to put there from an elder just very
[40:58] good. Amen. Hebrews 11:6.
[41:04] But without faith it is impossible to
[41:06] please him means to please God. For he
[41:10] that cometh to God must believe that God
[41:13] is and that God is a rewarder of them
[41:17] that diligently seek him. Amen. Then we
[41:22] go to Revelation 1.
[41:41] Revelation 11:17 says, "When I saw him,
[41:45] I John fell at his feet as dead, and he,
[41:50] Lord Jesus Christ, laid his right hand
[41:52] upon me, saying unto me, Fear not, I am
[41:56] the first and the last. I am he that
[41:59] liveth and was dead, and behold, I am
[42:03] alive forever more. Amen. And have the
[42:06] keys of hell and of death." May God
[42:11] bless the reading of his word. You can
[42:12] have a seat. Amen.
[42:26] This Wednesday of prayer, I just wanted
[42:28] to emphasize on what the Bible says that
[42:32] in the chapter of faith that without
[42:34] faith it is impossible to please God.
[42:37] You cannot pretend or cannot try to
[42:40] please God in other way but believing on
[42:43] what God has said and accepting him and
[42:46] walking by faith that the only way you
[42:48] have can please God and even Enoch
[42:52] pleased God. Verse five says Enoch was
[42:54] translated that he should not see death
[42:57] and was not found because God had
[42:59] translated him. For before he for before
[43:02] his translation, he had this testimony
[43:05] that Enoch pleased God. Enoch had
[43:08] pleased God by having faith in what God
[43:11] says regarding his word. Amen. Enoch
[43:14] prophesied about the coming of the Lord.
[43:16] Enoch prophesied there will be a
[43:18] Messiah. Enoch knew that there will be a
[43:20] Messiah. He had he walked with God,
[43:22] trust in God, build the pyramid having
[43:24] faith in God. even wrote the second
[43:27] Bible believing that what we God wrote
[43:30] in heaven can be translated into what he
[43:33] could he could translate into the
[43:35] pyramid and and lived also what he
[43:38] preached. Amen. Because his life was a
[43:41] testimony of what he preached. His life
[43:43] was a manifestation of what he preached.
[43:46] Amen. And then he pleased God by having
[43:48] faith in God. The prophet says in God's
[43:52] covenant with Abraham says Gazi round
[43:55] out his servant to ask and said is all
[43:57] well with thee and is all well with thy
[43:59] husband is all well with the child. He's
[44:02] asking the woman to whom was given the w
[44:04] the the the child and the child the
[44:08] prophet said the child a corpse and
[44:09] husband franking frantic and her riding
[44:12] at the at the break neck speed she said
[44:15] all is well. Prophet says I like that
[44:18] even though the substance symptoms the
[44:20] circumstances were negative everything
[44:22] was looking like like to me like nothing
[44:26] was really nothing was positive from
[44:29] what you could tell but even our test
[44:31] even those circumstances and the those
[44:33] circumstances faith was still all is
[44:37] well the prophet says I like that she
[44:40] was before the servant of the lord I
[44:42] think that where Mary got the idea
[44:45] Mark got the idea of meeting Jesus the
[44:48] way she did and said, "Lord, if thou
[44:50] would have been here, my brother had not
[44:52] died, but even now whatever you ask God,
[44:56] God will do it." That she knew that if
[44:58] God was in his prophet, surely he was in
[45:01] his son. So she approached in the right
[45:03] way, reverent, and she got what she
[45:06] asked for. So you approach God in a
[45:09] reverent way, you will get what you ask
[45:11] for. There's an approach to to get God.
[45:14] There is an approach to have fellowship
[45:16] with God and one of them is reverence.
[45:19] Reverently coming in the presence of
[45:21] God. And the prophet said the reason to
[45:23] that that we don't get what we ask for.
[45:25] We approach in the wrong way. We
[45:28] approach we got to approach we and then
[45:30] he didn't finish the sentence. Then he
[45:32] he quote this the scripture that we
[45:34] quoted says he that cometh to God must
[45:37] believe that he is and is a rewarder of
[45:40] those who diligently seek him. Just want
[45:43] to emphasize you come to God but you
[45:46] must believe God is. It's kind of a
[45:50] sentence that doesn't complete right God
[45:52] you believe that God is. Amen. We
[45:54] believe that God is and we as we
[45:57] approach God we I just want this evening
[46:01] to to emphasize a little bit on on on
[46:04] God on the Lord Jesus Christ. As we put
[46:07] here and there and all the word of God
[46:09] is Jesus Christ. So everything that we
[46:11] preach here is always Jesus Christ. But
[46:13] there just just to see who he is the
[46:15] Lord Jesus Christ. What revelation says
[46:18] of who he is. What the book of
[46:19] revelation says who the Lord Jesus
[46:22] Christ is. Believe that he is. Amen.
[46:26] Just give him the praise. Just to give
[46:27] him the first place just to give him the
[46:29] first the first authority just to
[46:31] elevate him a little bit more. Just to
[46:33] to praise him a little more. You are
[46:35] worthy to be praised. You are the lamb
[46:37] of God. You are the you are the great I
[46:39] am. You you are everything. You are our
[46:41] portion. You are our father. You you are
[46:43] the son. You are the holy ghost. You are
[46:46] everything. Amen. That's what we want to
[46:48] say. Lord, you are the you are the
[46:50] judge. You are the father. You are you
[46:52] are the healer. You are you you are my
[46:54] portion. You are the rose of Sharon. You
[46:57] are all the title the good title we can
[47:00] have belong to the Lord Jesus Christ
[47:02] more than any other thing. Amen. We are
[47:05] all nothing. We are all nothing. He's
[47:07] the one who deserves the glory and the
[47:09] honor. He's the redeemer. He's our He's
[47:13] our savior. He's everything. Amen. He's
[47:16] the one who has forgiven our sins.
[47:18] You're the one who has saved us. He is
[47:20] the one who has given us the promise for
[47:21] redemption, the promise for the
[47:23] resurrection, the promise for the
[47:25] rapture. All is about the Lord Jesus
[47:27] Christ. No man can pretend to be
[47:31] anything. Is about him and only him.
[47:34] Amen. believe that he is Lord. You are
[47:37] my all. You are my healer. All is well
[47:40] with you Lord Jesus Christ.
[47:43] The prophet says the voice of blessing
[47:45] said fear not don't be afraid. And after
[47:49] saying don't be afraid he qualifies
[47:51] himself I am the first and the last. I
[47:55] am the first and the last. It means
[47:56] before anything happened I was the
[47:59] first. Amen. And I am also the last word
[48:01] for every situation. I'm the one giving
[48:04] the last word, the last decision. Amen.
[48:07] Nothing can happen to your life before I
[48:09] know it. I know it before it happens to
[48:11] your life and the solution for your
[48:13] life. I am the last one who has to give
[48:15] the solution. I am everything in your
[48:18] life. Amen. Oh, I like that. Amen. I am
[48:22] he that liveth and was dead. And even
[48:24] when he died, he had a purpose why he
[48:26] died. He died because of you. Amen. He
[48:29] died because you were thinking of me. He
[48:31] was thinking of you and said, "Behold, I
[48:34] am alive and forever more. Where is
[48:36] there to fear?" The judgment that fell
[48:40] upon him at the cross at the grave and
[48:42] when he descended was for us. The
[48:45] prophet says, he absorbed the full
[48:47] branch of the wound of sin. And there is
[48:50] therefore now no condemnation to them
[48:54] which are in Christ Jesus. Glory to his
[48:57] name. See for short our attorney is our
[49:01] judge. He's both attorney and judge. If
[49:05] you have a good if if you want for any
[49:07] case for your case, if you have a
[49:09] problem, you got into trouble, you want
[49:10] to find the best attorney, the best
[49:13] advocate, the best the best who can
[49:16] defend for you the who can we where can
[49:19] we find the best attorney than Jesus
[49:21] Christ. He's the one who can defend us
[49:23] the best. Amen. because he took all the
[49:26] judgment everything. What he can tell
[49:28] the father is the father you know what I
[49:30] already paid the price for him so there
[49:33] is no condemnation of him there's no
[49:34] condemnation of her because I already
[49:36] paid the price look my bank account look
[49:39] my receipt everything is paid off so
[49:41] it's free but on top of that he is also
[49:44] the judge so he's the one making the
[49:47] decisions if he's the one making the
[49:49] decision he can only make a decision on
[49:51] behalf of the attorney because he's the
[49:54] same one amen so when you come to him
[49:57] remember who he is. Amen. Says a judge,
[50:02] the prophet says as judge, the case is
[50:04] settled. It is finished. So when the
[50:07] devil comes with condemnation, you show
[50:09] him that the case is finished. Because
[50:11] the attorney and the judge are the same
[50:14] person. Oh, I love that. There is now
[50:17] therefore no condemnation. Why should
[50:20] the church fear? What promise has he
[50:23] ever failed to manifest before us? Why
[50:26] should it fear punishment? Why should it
[50:29] fear punishment or death? It has all
[50:32] been overcome. He is the mighty
[50:35] conqueror. He is the mighty conqueror.
[50:38] Amen. Is worth reminding ourself that
[50:42] whatever
[50:43] about who is the one who needs to be
[50:46] worshiped. We need to remind ourselves
[50:49] oh who is the one who needs to be
[50:51] worshiped. So when you are singing, when
[50:53] you are worshiping, who is the one who
[50:55] needs to be worshiped? Is the lord of
[50:58] lord the king of kings.
[51:00] Now the prophet says, "Now all these
[51:02] expressions, him which is him which was
[51:05] and he is to come and faithful and
[51:07] faithful witness, the firstborn from
[51:10] among the dead and the prince of the
[51:12] kings of the earth, the alpha and the
[51:16] omega and the almighty. They are all
[51:18] titles and descriptions of the one and
[51:22] same person who is the Lord Jesus Christ
[51:25] who washed us from our sins in his own
[51:29] blood. Amen. I love that he not only
[51:32] washed us by his blood but he washed us
[51:34] in his own blood. He immersed us into
[51:38] his own blood. Amen. And then we came
[51:40] out from it completely pure. Amen.
[51:43] That's our Lord Jesus Christ. That's the
[51:44] one who deserve to be praised. He's the
[51:47] one who took the title, the title of God
[51:50] himself. In Isaiah 44:6, it says, "Thus
[51:54] say the Lord, the King of Israel, and
[51:57] his Redeemer, the Lord of hosts. I am
[52:00] the first and I am the last. And besides
[52:04] me there is no God." That was Jehovah in
[52:07] the Old Testament. Amen. The only person
[52:10] who can say that was Jehovah in the Old
[52:12] Testament. But this in the the new
[52:15] testament the same God come in the form
[52:18] of the Lord Jesus Christ and he declares
[52:20] to John who represent the bride. I am
[52:23] the first and I am the last. Amen. I am
[52:27] your redeemer. Amen. I am the one and
[52:30] besides me there is no other God. That's
[52:32] why the Lord Jesus Christ is our God and
[52:35] the only true God. Oh we worship you
[52:38] Lord. We thank you father. Amen. Amen.
[52:41] Isaiah 43:12. Hearken unto me, oh Jacob
[52:44] and Israel. My call, I am he. I am the
[52:48] first. I am also the last. That Jehovah
[52:52] the Old Testament is the Lord Jesus
[52:54] Christ. That why Jesus Christ is the
[52:57] name above any other name. When you come
[53:00] in the name of Jesus Christ, it's like
[53:03] Jesus Christ himself praying to the
[53:05] father when you come in the name of
[53:07] Jesus Christ because that the only
[53:09] redemptive name by which you we can be
[53:12] saved. Amen. Do you realize who we are
[53:15] worshiping? Amen.
[53:17] The prophet says, "He that descended has
[53:20] now ascended above all and unto him has
[53:24] been given a name that is above every
[53:26] name." Yes. He conquered death. He
[53:29] conquered hell. He conquered the grave.
[53:31] He has the keys thereof. He has the key.
[53:34] But the devil doesn't have any key.
[53:36] Doesn't have any control of any
[53:38] situation. God is the one who is in
[53:40] control of every situation because he
[53:43] conquered the the place where the devil
[53:45] used to use in order to make to put fear
[53:48] on people or fear of death, fear of
[53:50] hell, fear of the grave. But Christ
[53:52] conquered all of three, all of them.
[53:55] says, "And what he looses and it's
[53:58] loosed and what he binds is bound.
[54:00] There's no changing of it. There is
[54:02] there was no conqueror before him. There
[54:04] is none beside him. He alone is the
[54:07] savior, is the redeemer, is the only God
[54:10] and the Lord Jesus Christ is his name."
[54:14] He says, "The greatest of all revelation
[54:17] is the deity, the supreme deity of our
[54:21] Lord Jesus Christ. You can't get to f
[54:24] you can't get to first base until you
[54:27] believe that. So the greatest of all
[54:30] revelation sometimes we have simplifies
[54:33] it. Sometimes we have maybe we even the
[54:36] denomination have caught up a little bit
[54:38] to that and now the denomination is most
[54:40] of them believe that Jesus Christ is
[54:42] God. Most of them believe but in their
[54:44] mind they're probably thinking oh it the
[54:48] the the trinity form it was there is a
[54:51] god the father there is a god the son
[54:54] there is a god the holy ghost all of
[54:56] them they are bound together somewhere
[54:58] you know sometimes they have to agree
[55:00] all together they always think the same
[55:02] way it's a it's a denominational ideal
[55:05] idea amen they all those different
[55:08] things or you know we can't comprehend
[55:10] those oh so maybe you know the God God
[55:14] the Lord Jesus Christ just a man.
[55:16] Different ideas but it was it is
[55:19] actually the same God who just cannot
[55:23] himself and he took another form of a
[55:26] man took another form. The same God like
[55:29] you see me like here I went here and I
[55:32] come out with this one. The same person
[55:34] but in a different form but exactly the
[55:38] same form. Amen. There is a difference
[55:40] between us
[55:43] time. There is a difference even between
[55:45] Adam and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[55:48] Adam was the word pronounced creative
[55:51] word. Jesus Christ was the creative
[55:53] word. But Adam was not the fullness of
[55:56] God. But the Lord Jesus Christ was the
[55:59] fullness of God himself in the Lord
[56:02] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[56:05] Wonderful. Amen. Amen. Prophet says
[56:08] that's what Peter said. Repent and then
[56:10] see the deity. Be baptized in the name
[56:12] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[56:14] your sins and then you are ready to go
[56:16] in the spirit. The first thing you have
[56:18] to know is the deity of Christ. I am the
[56:21] alpha and omega. I am from A to Zed.
[56:24] There is no more but me. I was at the
[56:27] beginning. I'll be at the end. Think
[56:30] about it. I was at the beginning of the
[56:32] situation you're going through. I'm at
[56:34] the end of the situation you're going
[56:35] through. I am he that was, which is, and
[56:38] shall come, the Almighty. Think of it.
[56:40] That's what the trumpet said. That
[56:42] prophet says, think of it. That's what
[56:43] the trumpet said. I'm the alpha and I'm
[56:46] the omega. Oh, you see the things
[56:47] happening in the church. You see the
[56:49] things happening among the message
[56:51] realm. You see what happening? Some
[56:53] negativity is going here there. No,
[56:55] don't worry. God is at the is at the
[56:58] beginning. He's also at the end. The
[57:00] message will defend itself. Amen.
[57:02] Sometime we don't even need to defend
[57:04] the message. The message will defend
[57:05] itself because God is the alpha and the
[57:08] omega. The Lord Jesus Christ is the
[57:10] alpha and the omega. The message can
[57:12] never be defeated. The word of God can
[57:15] never be defeated.
[57:17] Says all right. The first of all
[57:19] revelations is the supreme deity of
[57:23] Jesus Christ. You must know you must
[57:26] know who he is when you hear the voice.
[57:31] Amen. I'll say this. You cannot
[57:34] understand the word made flesh in the
[57:36] bride unless you understand the
[57:39] revelation of the supreme deity of the
[57:42] Lord Jesus Christ. Unless you value also
[57:45] the supreme deity of the Lord Jesus
[57:48] Christ. Sometimes we have maybe not you
[57:52] but sometimes I I I have the fear that
[57:55] sometimes we have simplified
[57:58] the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ to to
[58:02] something I don't know I don't know but
[58:06] I've seen that in my life where people I
[58:08] don't know how they take brother Banam
[58:10] and they seem to compare it to the Lord
[58:12] Jesus Christ. There's some similarities.
[58:15] There's some similarities. Amen. Don't
[58:17] get me wrong. There's some similarities
[58:19] there some but you can brother Banam is
[58:22] not is not the Lord Jesus Christ. The
[58:25] Lord Jesus Christ is way way way way
[58:29] above the brother Banam. As much as we
[58:32] value brother Banam but you can't
[58:34] compare brother Banam to the Lord Jesus
[58:36] Christ. The Jesus Christ is the savior.
[58:39] He's the redeemer. Brother Banam is not
[58:42] a savior. Brother Banam is not the
[58:43] redeemer. I know it sounds simple but
[58:46] you know when we pray we are not praying
[58:48] to brother vanam we are praying to the
[58:49] lord Jesus Christ omnipotent god
[58:53] omnipotent god
[58:59] he was not simply a prophet he was god
[59:03] says it plainly says here is revelation
[59:05] that Jesus is that which is that which
[59:08] was and that which is to come is the
[59:10] alpha and the omega which means he is
[59:12] the a to said he all of it is
[59:16] everything. The Almighty is the rose of
[59:18] Sharon. He's the lily of the valley, the
[59:20] bright and morning star, the righteous
[59:22] branch, the father, the son, the holy
[59:25] ghost. He is God, almighty God, one God.
[59:29] 1 Timothy 3:16 says, "And without
[59:32] controversy, great is the mystery of
[59:34] godliness. God was manifest in the
[59:36] flesh, flesh, justified in the spirit,
[59:39] seen of angels, preached unto the
[59:42] Gentiles, believed on in the world,
[59:45] received up into glory. This is what the
[59:48] Bible says, the prophecy. It doesn't say
[59:50] a a thing about the first or second or
[59:52] third person. Here it says God was
[59:55] manifest in flesh, one God. So means God
[59:59] took the form of a flesh.
[1:00:02] Your God is so great. so great that he
[1:00:06] can humble himself so low so long to the
[1:00:10] point where he can put himself in a form
[1:00:13] of being ignorant. Can you imagine the
[1:00:16] great God took a certain time a portion
[1:00:20] for redemption he make himself flesh to
[1:00:23] the point who becomes ignorant that say
[1:00:26] I don't know when I can when I will come
[1:00:30] back only when I return in my form of a
[1:00:34] father of the holy ghost then I will
[1:00:36] know when I will come back the same god
[1:00:38] think about it
[1:00:41] that blows my mind then you'll be
[1:00:43] wondering but if it's god how does
[1:00:44] didn't came he doesn't know he's God but
[1:00:47] he put himself in a place where he
[1:00:49] becomes a man where he can suffer when
[1:00:52] he can go through what we go through in
[1:00:55] order for redemption but doesn't remove
[1:00:58] the quality of him being God that's why
[1:01:01] prophet says you see Jehovah in a manger
[1:01:04] you see Jehovah playing it's still
[1:01:07] Jehovah but Jehovah has put himself
[1:01:10] condoned himself in a form of of a weak
[1:01:14] form but for redemption. Amen.
[1:01:18] Amen.
[1:01:22] I hope it's okay. Amen. It can only be
[1:01:24] okay because it's the supreme
[1:01:26] revelation.
[1:01:28] Amen.
[1:01:32] Says that one God was manifest in flesh
[1:01:35] that ought to settle it. God came in a
[1:01:37] human form that didn't make him another
[1:01:40] God. He was God. The same God is a re it
[1:01:43] was a revelation then it is a revelation
[1:01:46] now one God and let me say this I'm not
[1:01:49] God in human form I'm not God in human
[1:01:52] form you are not God in human form by
[1:01:54] the way was not God in human form no one
[1:01:58] can says no I came back from the pill of
[1:02:00] fire I'm going back to the pill of fire
[1:02:02] no one but it is the pill of fire inside
[1:02:05] of you the pill of fire portion of pill
[1:02:07] of fire inside of me no one is God in
[1:02:10] human form but we tabernacle God in our
[1:02:14] flesh. Amen. But Jesus Christ was God in
[1:02:19] human form. Amen. There is only one name
[1:02:22] that is one name that is above any other
[1:02:24] name is the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:27] Christ. God has many titles as we said
[1:02:30] our righteousness, our peace, our
[1:02:32] everpresent, the father, the son, the
[1:02:34] holy ghost. But he has only one human
[1:02:37] name and that name is Jesus.
[1:02:40] Don't be confused because he has three
[1:02:42] offices or that he has a three-fold
[1:02:44] manifestation on earth. He was a prophet
[1:02:48] in heaven. He is a priest and coming
[1:02:50] back to earth is the king of kings.
[1:02:54] He that was that is Jesus the prophet.
[1:02:57] He that is let me say this
[1:03:03] brother was not the prophet he was a
[1:03:07] prophet. Amen. Amen. But was not was not
[1:03:12] the son of man. He was a son of man. He
[1:03:15] was a son of man revealing the son of
[1:03:18] man. Amen. So when we receive the
[1:03:21] message, we are receiving the son of
[1:03:23] man. Amen. He was a son of man revealing
[1:03:26] the word, the Christ, the son of man.
[1:03:29] Amen. So that's what the prophet say.
[1:03:31] Jesus is the prophet, the prophet. He
[1:03:35] that is he that that he is the high
[1:03:38] priest making intercession. One who can
[1:03:40] be touched with the feelings of
[1:03:42] infirmities which is to come. That is
[1:03:44] the coming king on earth. He was the
[1:03:47] word the prophet. Amen. You know the
[1:03:49] proverbs say you know dispensation the
[1:03:51] son of the son of god the son of man the
[1:03:54] son of god through the ages and then he
[1:03:56] become the son of David. But between the
[1:03:59] son of god and the son of David there is
[1:04:02] a portion where he comes again to be
[1:04:04] manifested as the son of man.
[1:04:07] There come a time where we manifest
[1:04:09] himself as the prophet the prophet
[1:04:12] that's why when baranam is is is um
[1:04:16] discerning the thought and intent of the
[1:04:18] the heart at some point he will be
[1:04:20] discerning and says oh I don't even know
[1:04:23] what I said I don't know what he said I
[1:04:26] have to listen to the tapes to hear what
[1:04:29] he said it was my voice but it was not
[1:04:31] me. Amen. So that was the the sign of
[1:04:34] the messiah. It was God using a vessel
[1:04:36] of a man but it does not make the
[1:04:38] prophet the prophet. It was still God
[1:04:41] the word of God is the prophet. Amen. So
[1:04:44] that's why whether the prophet is alive
[1:04:46] whether the prophet has gone the word
[1:04:48] has not diminished his power. Amen. We
[1:04:51] still believe the same word still have
[1:04:53] the same power. Amen. The same
[1:04:55] manifestation. Amen. The same potential.
[1:04:58] Are you with me this evening? Amen.
[1:05:01] Moses said unto him, "The Lord your God
[1:05:04] will raise up a prophet like unto me,
[1:05:06] and it will come to pass if they don't
[1:05:08] hear the words of that prophet, they
[1:05:10] will be cut off from among the people."
[1:05:14] Thank God we are part of the plan of
[1:05:16] God.
[1:05:18] The Bible says, "He will come forth in
[1:05:20] power and glory and take the authority
[1:05:22] to reign as king." He is the coming king
[1:05:25] of the earth. Of course, that does not
[1:05:27] say he is not king now. For he is our
[1:05:31] king. He's the king of the saints. Right
[1:05:34] now, it is a spiritual kingdom. It is
[1:05:37] not of this world system. Even as we are
[1:05:40] not of this world, that's the reason we
[1:05:43] act different from the world. Our
[1:05:45] citizenship is in heaven. Amen. Our
[1:05:49] citizenship is not here. Our citizenship
[1:05:51] is in heaven. says we reflect the spirit
[1:05:54] of the world of our rebirth where Jesus
[1:05:57] is the king. This is why our women do
[1:06:00] not dress in men's clothing
[1:06:03] or cut their hair or use all those
[1:06:06] cosmetic and other things that the world
[1:06:08] likes so much. That is why our men don't
[1:06:12] drink, they don't smoke, they don't
[1:06:13] carry on in sin. Why? Because our
[1:06:17] citizenship is from above. Amen. Our
[1:06:20] dominion is the dominion over sin and it
[1:06:23] is in force through the power that is in
[1:06:25] the spirit of Christ that indwells us.
[1:06:29] Every kingdom on earth is going to be
[1:06:32] torn down but ours will remain.
[1:06:36] Thank God to be part of the kingdom of
[1:06:38] God. Amen. And in that kingdom no one is
[1:06:41] above the other. Amen. No one is above
[1:06:44] the other. We are all born of the Holy
[1:06:46] Ghost. We can have different functions
[1:06:49] but no one is above the other. Not even
[1:06:52] the brother above the sister. We are all
[1:06:54] born with the same Holy Ghost but
[1:06:56] different different function different
[1:06:58] things. Amen. The pastor is not above
[1:07:01] the congregation. No, he is also born of
[1:07:03] the same Holy Ghost. He submit himself
[1:07:05] to the word of God. Amen. As every
[1:07:07] believer submit himself the to the word
[1:07:10] of God. Yes, we respect him. He has a
[1:07:12] function but he's actually the servant
[1:07:14] of the people. He's submitting he is
[1:07:17] actually the servant. Amen. But uh there
[1:07:19] is no one above the other all at the
[1:07:22] same level. The holiness the holiness is
[1:07:24] not reserved only to the pastor. It's
[1:07:27] not reserved only to the deacon. Amen.
[1:07:29] It's for everybody. Amen. Prophet says
[1:07:32] that's why no man can never come along
[1:07:35] and say the holy man is a pope or the
[1:07:37] holy man is a bishop or a priest. The
[1:07:40] holy man is Christ. The holy spirit in
[1:07:43] us. How dare the the hierarchy declare
[1:07:47] the lady has no word to say you know you
[1:07:50] can't say you can't tell me anything you
[1:07:53] know but pastor you know you preached
[1:07:55] the other day this way but I read
[1:07:57] brother when I'm saying something here
[1:07:59] how can you put that together no you
[1:08:02] can't say anything
[1:08:04] I'm when I'm preaching you know I'm
[1:08:05] under the anointing you can't tell me
[1:08:07] anything no no no no
[1:08:10] there there is one above the pastor amen
[1:08:13] that the holy ghost amen Amen. To submit
[1:08:15] himself. The pastor does know
[1:08:17] everything. That does not know
[1:08:18] everything. He's also under the
[1:08:20] anointing under submission of the of of
[1:08:22] the word of God.
[1:08:25] Says how the ary declare the late has no
[1:08:27] word to say. Each one has something to
[1:08:30] say. Each has a work. Each has a
[1:08:33] ministry. The Holy Ghost came at
[1:08:36] Pentecost and separated himself on each
[1:08:39] that it might be fulfilled whereof of
[1:08:41] Christ said, "At that day you shall know
[1:08:44] that I am in my father, ye in me, and I
[1:08:47] in you." Amen. John 14:20. The great I
[1:08:51] am. The almighty God has come a spirit
[1:08:54] to fill his true church. He has a right
[1:08:57] to move anywhere he wants to and upon
[1:09:00] anybody he wants to. We don't make any
[1:09:03] holy man among us but the whole true
[1:09:06] congregation of the Lord is holy. Amen.
[1:09:09] That's why in the prayer meeting we
[1:09:11] allow everybody to pray. Everybody to
[1:09:13] pray because the Holy Ghost is free and
[1:09:16] can anoint anyone. Amen. It's not only
[1:09:19] reserved to one person to pray. Amen.
[1:09:21] All of us we are called to pray because
[1:09:24] all the congregation is holy by the Holy
[1:09:27] Spirit. Amen. says the whole true
[1:09:29] congregation of the Lord is holy and
[1:09:32] because because of the presence of the
[1:09:34] Holy Spirit. It is he, the Holy Spirit
[1:09:38] that is holy, not the congregation of
[1:09:41] itself. No, it is by the Holy Ghost that
[1:09:45] the congregation is holy. Amen.
[1:09:50] A simple question as I think I'll be
[1:09:52] closing to allow prayer. Simple
[1:09:54] question. Give me a few minutes. Adam
[1:09:57] was a son of God created by the word of
[1:10:00] God. He was a spirit man before he
[1:10:04] became a flesh man. In fact, his
[1:10:07] chemical blood was pure because it was a
[1:10:10] creative blood like I said earlier. But
[1:10:12] when sin came in, why could not his
[1:10:15] blood clean him? Why could not the blood
[1:10:18] of of Adam clean Eve or clean himself?
[1:10:23] Why?
[1:10:24] Good question. think it made me think.
[1:10:27] So why actually if you look there's a
[1:10:30] lot of similarity of the Lord Jesus
[1:10:31] Christ was created it was Jesus Christ
[1:10:36] was virgin born but it was actually the
[1:10:38] same creative word inside of the womb.
[1:10:41] So there a lot of similarities but why
[1:10:45] the prophet doesn't call the blood of
[1:10:47] Adam the blood of God but he calls the
[1:10:49] blood of Jesus Christ the blood of God.
[1:10:53] Revelation 15, unto him that loved us
[1:10:56] and washed us from our sins in his own
[1:10:58] blood. God has made flesh. This is the
[1:11:01] word washed is actually loosed. Loosed
[1:11:05] us from our sins in his own blood. God
[1:11:08] was made flesh and dwelt among us and
[1:11:11] redeemed us redeemed us unto himself. We
[1:11:14] are saved by the blood of God.
[1:11:17] It's not the blood of the Jews. It's not
[1:11:19] the blood of the Gentiles. It's not the
[1:11:21] blood of Joseph. is not the blood of
[1:11:23] Mary is the blood of God himself. The
[1:11:27] eternal God indwelt a mortal body in
[1:11:29] order to take away sin. He became the
[1:11:32] lamb in order to shed his blood and
[1:11:35] enter into the veil with it. Consider
[1:11:38] this. Since it is the blood of God, it
[1:11:41] is perfect blood. Amen. The the blood of
[1:11:45] Adam was not perfect blood, but the
[1:11:47] blood of Jesus Christ was perfect blood.
[1:11:51] If the perfect blood is loosing us from
[1:11:54] the power and bondage and defilement of
[1:11:56] sin, then the loosing is also perfect
[1:12:00] and complete. Amen. I like that.
[1:12:02] Loosing, separation. I repeat that many
[1:12:04] times, but it just blows my mind. It's
[1:12:07] the loosing and the separation from sin.
[1:12:10] It is perfect and it is complete. Amen.
[1:12:13] There is now therefore no condemnation
[1:12:16] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:12:18] elect. Amen. If you look into the blood,
[1:12:21] what God considers the blood, you look
[1:12:23] the blood in Leviticus 17, it says, "The
[1:12:27] life of the flesh is in the blood." So I
[1:12:30] have given it to you upon the altar to
[1:12:33] make an atonement for your souls. For it
[1:12:36] is the blood that makes an atonement for
[1:12:38] the souls. For it is the life of all
[1:12:42] flesh. The blood of it is for the life
[1:12:44] thereof. Therefore I said unto the
[1:12:46] children of Israel, you shall eat the
[1:12:48] blood of no manner of flesh. For the
[1:12:51] life of all flesh is the blood thereof.
[1:12:54] Whatsoever eat ofth eat shall be cut
[1:12:56] off. That's what God represents. Say the
[1:12:59] blood the life is actually in the blood.
[1:13:01] Amen. You see the life of of Adam was
[1:13:05] the life of of God in Adam. A portion
[1:13:07] life of God in Adam. But it was not the
[1:13:10] perfection. Amen. It was not the
[1:13:12] fullness of the life of God, but the
[1:13:14] life of Jesus Christ. It was the
[1:13:17] fullness of the life of God. All deity
[1:13:22] was in the Lord Jesus Christ. So when he
[1:13:25] shed his blood, it was the blood of God
[1:13:27] himself. Did you know that Adam actually
[1:13:31] sinned?
[1:13:33] Amen. Adam sinned. The prophet says Adam
[1:13:37] sinned. says, "You remember I took Adam
[1:13:40] and Eve before the world before sin came
[1:13:43] into the world." You look at Adam, what
[1:13:45] a beautiful type. Adam and Eve was a
[1:13:47] type of Christ and in the church. Now
[1:13:49] remember, Eve did not sin. Adam sinned.
[1:13:55] Oh wow.
[1:13:59] That's kind of surprising, right?
[1:14:01] Usually think, oh, that Eve sinned.
[1:14:02] Don't prophet says no. God making his
[1:14:05] promise. Eve did not sin. Adam sinned.
[1:14:07] That's right. Not Eve. Adam sinned. Not
[1:14:11] Eve. She was the one who did the act.
[1:14:13] But Adam done the sinning. The woman was
[1:14:16] deceived.
[1:14:18] The Bible say she was deceived. She
[1:14:21] thought she was right. She thought she
[1:14:25] was right. Brother Hall used to say she
[1:14:28] thought she had a new revelation.
[1:14:31] So know, oh, I have a new revelation.
[1:14:33] Now I'm going to tell Adam, you know,
[1:14:35] Adam, this is a new revelation. You
[1:14:37] know, I got this from from Saber. He
[1:14:39] told me that this, you know what, that's
[1:14:40] why we are Adam. No, he knew the word of
[1:14:43] God. Said, "No, that's not a new
[1:14:45] revelation. I'm sorry you made a mistake
[1:14:47] there. But I'm going to do this because
[1:14:50] I love you. Because I want to redeem
[1:14:52] you." He knew what he was doing. Eve did
[1:14:56] not know what she was doing. She was
[1:14:57] completely deceived. She thought she had
[1:15:00] a new revelation.
[1:15:06] the prophecy. She thought she was right,
[1:15:07] but Adam know it was wrong. Now how look
[1:15:11] when Adam saw Eve had seen and had done
[1:15:13] wrong, Adam walked right out, not
[1:15:16] deceived, but with both eyes open. But
[1:15:20] he so loved Eve that he took her place
[1:15:23] in death with her and walked out with
[1:15:26] her. You know that that exactly what
[1:15:30] Jesus had done. The church is guilty.
[1:15:34] The church has sinned. That's right. But
[1:15:36] Christ come and was made sin. Christ did
[1:15:40] not sin. Christ was made sin. He was
[1:15:43] made sin and took the place and walked
[1:15:46] with his church and condemned sin in the
[1:15:48] flesh that he might redeem his his bride
[1:15:51] back to him again. What a beautiful
[1:15:54] picture, friend. Amen. Though when the
[1:15:57] bride realizes what the Lord has done
[1:16:00] for her, she can only say, "You are
[1:16:03] worthy to be praised, the lamb of God,
[1:16:06] for redeeming me. Thank you for
[1:16:08] redeeming me. Thank you for making me
[1:16:11] part of the redemption. No one could
[1:16:14] save me like you have saved me. No one
[1:16:17] could rescue me like you have rescued
[1:16:19] me. You took my place. You came, you
[1:16:21] became sin and took me from that place
[1:16:24] where I was in a type like Adam. But you
[1:16:27] came, you didn't sin. You knew what you
[1:16:29] were doing. You gave your life for me
[1:16:31] and you redeemed me by the blood of God
[1:16:34] himself.
[1:16:36] The blood of God himself.
[1:16:39] 1 Timothy 2:14 says, "And Adam was not
[1:16:42] deceived, but the woman was was being
[1:16:45] deceived was in the transgression."
[1:16:50] Romans 5:12, "Wherefore, as by one man
[1:16:53] sin entered into the world, and death by
[1:16:56] sin, so death passed upon all men, for
[1:17:00] that all have sinned." But the blood of
[1:17:03] Jesus Christ has restored us. When Adam
[1:17:06] sinned by heeding to his wife reasoning
[1:17:09] instead of holding to God's word, that's
[1:17:11] what made Adam sin, his wife reasoning
[1:17:14] with Satan and then produced the product
[1:17:17] to Adam. The prophet says, "Adam turned
[1:17:20] loose the word and sold out and he lost
[1:17:23] he lost also his inheritance. When he
[1:17:26] lost his fellowship and right to life."
[1:17:29] Remember the day you eat thereof, that
[1:17:31] day you die. But when he lost his life,
[1:17:33] he also lost his inheritance in life
[1:17:36] because he had completely supreme
[1:17:38] control of the earth. Amen. And then
[1:17:41] down says, "But couldn't we stop here?"
[1:17:44] And then he says, "Oh, then if the blood
[1:17:47] has cleansed it back, what about now?
[1:17:50] The blood of Jesus Christ brought us
[1:17:52] back to the level where Adam did not
[1:17:56] sin. Before the fall, that's where the
[1:17:58] blood of Jesus Christ is bringing us
[1:18:00] back before the fall." Amen. Where Adam
[1:18:03] could have fellowship with God without
[1:18:05] anything separating between God and
[1:18:08] them. That's where the blood of Jesus
[1:18:10] Christ brings us back to. That's what
[1:18:12] the bleeding word brings us back to.
[1:18:14] Amen. That we can have fellowship with
[1:18:17] God.
[1:18:19] Look what the son of God, the second
[1:18:21] Adam did. The works that I do shall you
[1:18:24] shall you also. Adam lost his
[1:18:27] inheritance, the earth. It passed from
[1:18:29] his hand to the the one he sold out to
[1:18:32] Satan. He sold his faith in God. So to
[1:18:35] Satan's reasoning, therefore is eternal
[1:18:38] life. His right to the tree of life, his
[1:18:40] right to the earth belonged to him and
[1:18:43] he forfeited every bit to the hands of
[1:18:45] Satan. He passed it from the hand for
[1:18:48] his hand to Satan. Therefore, now it has
[1:18:50] been it returned and has been polluted.
[1:18:53] The seed of Adam has destroyed
[1:18:55] inheritance of Adam that Adam should
[1:18:58] have had. That's the earth is talking
[1:19:00] about the earth is not talking about the
[1:19:02] the book. The book could not go in the
[1:19:04] dirty hands of Satan. Had to go back to
[1:19:06] God. But the earth now is handled by
[1:19:08] Satan. Amen. But the blood of Jesus
[1:19:11] Christ brings us back back again to the
[1:19:14] fellowship with God.
[1:19:19] Let me read this.
[1:19:21] It says,
[1:19:24] but in one last closing glimpse of this
[1:19:26] chapter, see him as he stands here in
[1:19:28] the midst of the golden lampstick
[1:19:30] lampstand with the seven stars in his
[1:19:32] right hand. It is breathtaking to see
[1:19:35] him standing there in his supreme deity.
[1:19:39] He's the judge. He's the priest. He's
[1:19:42] the king, the eagle, the lamb, the lion,
[1:19:48] the alpha, the omega, the beginning and
[1:19:52] the end, the father, the son, the holy
[1:19:55] ghost. He which was, which is, which is
[1:19:58] to come, the almighty, the all in all.
[1:20:01] I've read that many times but the
[1:20:04] prophet was not saying the same quote.
[1:20:06] It's not the same quote I'm reading at
[1:20:08] many different places. He's repeating
[1:20:10] the same thing to put the emphasis on
[1:20:12] that is the almighty is the all in all.
[1:20:16] There he is. He's the author and the
[1:20:18] finisher. He's the worthy is that lamb.
[1:20:21] He proved his worth as he bought our
[1:20:24] salvation by himself. Now he stands in
[1:20:26] all his power and all his glory with all
[1:20:29] things committed unto him as a judge.
[1:20:32] Amen. And in our age we have received
[1:20:35] the judge. Amen. The one who has the the
[1:20:37] right wing upon him is the supreme judge
[1:20:40] among us to settle our case. Amen. Amen.
[1:20:44] Amen. Brother Peter, I would invite you
[1:20:46] to sing softly as I'm closing here. The
[1:20:50] prophet says the position of seven
[1:20:51] church ages. Please before he reveals
[1:20:55] the characteristics of the last age to
[1:20:57] us, he gives us one final look at his
[1:21:00] own gracious and supreme deity. This is
[1:21:03] the capstone revelation of himself. The
[1:21:06] capstone revelation of himself is the
[1:21:09] supreme deity of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:21:16] That's why the Bible says Colossians
[1:21:18] 1:16, "For by him were all things
[1:21:21] created, that in heaven and that are on
[1:21:23] earth, visible and invisible, whether
[1:21:26] there be thrones or dominions or
[1:21:28] principalities or powers, all things
[1:21:31] were created by him and for him is
[1:21:34] before all things and by him all things
[1:21:37] consist." Amen. How many can say praise
[1:21:41] be to God?
[1:21:43] Amen. In the beginning was the word and
[1:21:46] the word was with God and the word was
[1:21:48] God. The same was in the beginning with
[1:21:50] God. All things were made by him and
[1:21:54] without him was not anything made that
[1:21:57] was not made that was made. Have he in
[1:22:00] the last days spoken unto us by Son whom
[1:22:03] he had appointed heir of all things by
[1:22:06] whom also he made all worlds. Amen. He
[1:22:10] is the omnipotent God. Amen. The alpha
[1:22:12] and the omega, the first and the last
[1:22:16] for every situations.
[1:22:18] And if it omnipotent God, the prophet
[1:22:22] says, "Don't fear John. Don't fear
[1:22:24] little flock. All that I am, you are
[1:22:27] heir to to it. All my power is yours. My
[1:22:31] omnipotence is yours. As I stand in your
[1:22:33] midst, I have not come to bring fear and
[1:22:36] failure, but of love and courage and
[1:22:38] ability. All power is given unto me and
[1:22:42] it is yours to use. We are privileged to
[1:22:44] use the power of God. You speak the word
[1:22:47] and I will perform it. That is my
[1:22:49] covenant and I can never fail. Amen. So
[1:22:53] we are God part in this last age. We are
[1:22:57] part of God's in this last age. And if
[1:23:01] he's God omnipotence we can use God says
[1:23:03] himself in revelation one. He says, "He
[1:23:05] had made us kings and priests unto God
[1:23:08] and his father. To him be glory and
[1:23:10] dominion forever and ever. He has made
[1:23:14] us." The prophet says there are certain
[1:23:17] truths we need to emphasize. This is one
[1:23:20] of them.
[1:23:22] This is one of them. He had made us.
[1:23:26] Salvation is not salvation is not our
[1:23:29] doing. Salvation is his doing. Salvation
[1:23:32] is of the Lord all of grace. He redeemed
[1:23:37] us for a purpose. He bought us for a
[1:23:40] purpose. We are kings, spiritual kings.
[1:23:44] We are going to be kings upon the earth
[1:23:46] with him when he sits on his throne. But
[1:23:49] now we are spiritual kings and we reign
[1:23:52] over spiritual kingdom. It says in
[1:23:55] Romans 5:15, "If by one man's offense
[1:23:58] death reign by one, how much they which
[1:24:01] receive abundance of grace and of the
[1:24:03] gift of the righteousness shall reign in
[1:24:05] life by one Jesus Christ who had
[1:24:09] delivered us from the power of darkness
[1:24:11] and had translated us into the kingdom
[1:24:13] prophecies reign of his dear son. Right
[1:24:17] now, we reign with Christ having
[1:24:19] dominion over sin, the world, the flesh,
[1:24:22] and the devil. So, you can't say, "I am
[1:24:25] a king," but you're still under dominion
[1:24:27] of sin. No, under dominion of the flesh,
[1:24:30] on the dominion of the devil. No.
[1:24:32] Showing forth his praise and glory,
[1:24:35] showing for himself, for it is Christ in
[1:24:38] us, willing and doing of his good
[1:24:40] pleasure. Yes indeed. Even now we are
[1:24:43] sitting in heavenly places in Christ
[1:24:46] Jesus.
[1:24:48] And he has made us priests. Yes, priests
[1:24:50] unto him. Offering the spiritual praise
[1:24:53] of sanctified lips. Spending our lives
[1:24:56] as a sweet offering unto him. Worshiping
[1:24:59] him in spirit and in truth. Interceding
[1:25:02] and petitioning priests and kings unto
[1:25:05] our God. No wonder the world does not
[1:25:08] appeal to us. And we are peculiar
[1:25:10] people, zealous unto good works. We have
[1:25:13] been recreated in him to be children
[1:25:16] like unto our father. That's why when
[1:25:20] the opening of the word in revelation 5,
[1:25:22] you repeat the same scripture in
[1:25:24] revelation one saying that I've made he
[1:25:26] has made us kings and priests. When we
[1:25:30] realize what god has done for you, when
[1:25:32] you realize who God is and what he has
[1:25:34] done for you, there is nothing else but
[1:25:36] praising him and worshiping him. You are
[1:25:39] worthy, worthy, worthy to be praised.
[1:25:42] Amen. Let's give a hand to the Lord this
[1:25:44] evening. I just want you to praise him.
[1:25:47] I just want you to glorify him. I just
[1:25:49] want you to put all the emphasis upon
[1:25:51] him because without him, we are nothing.
[1:25:55] Nothing. Completely nothing. Amen.
[1:25:59] I bless your name. I bless your name. I
[1:26:02] bless your name.
