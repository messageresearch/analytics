[0:53] bad flu for a couple weeks and I'm sure
[0:56] there's more needs. You can raise your
[0:57] hand if you have a need.
[1:03] Let's just pray together. Lord Jesus,
[1:06] we're so grateful to come into your
[1:08] presence because of the shed blood at
[1:11] Calvary.
[1:12] &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you for Calvary. We thank
[1:14] you for coming, Lord, becoming a man,
[1:17] Lord, like we heard this morning, Lord,
[1:19] just a few minutes ago. You became the
[1:22] amorph of a man, Lord. And we praise you
[1:24] for that. And now you've come, Lord, in
[1:27] the form of the Holy Spirit to dwell in
[1:30] your people, Lord. And here we are,
[1:32] Lord, your people. And I believe that by
[1:34] the spirit of the Lord, by the Holy
[1:36] Ghost, we are you are living inside of
[1:39] us, Lord. And we're here to worship you,
[1:42] Lord, to praise your name, to hear your
[1:44] word, glorify your name. We want to have
[1:48] the right attitude. We want to just
[1:50] receive every word of God that proceeds
[1:53] out of the mouth of God. And this
[1:56] morning, Lord, we have different prayer
[1:57] requests, Lord Jesus.
[2:00] Oh, Father, we pray, oh, for brother for
[2:04] sister Wendy's and brother Blaine's um
[2:07] children, Lord, as they're traveling,
[2:09] Lord, that would you be with them and
[2:12] and by them, Lord God, protect them and
[2:14] shield them, Lord. The weather is
[2:16] stormy, but Lord Jesus, when the angels
[2:19] of God are with us, Lord Jesus, there's
[2:21] nothing for us to fear. We believe that
[2:24] you take care of them, Lord. So we ask,
[2:26] Lord, take care of them, Father, in the
[2:28] name of Jesus, and the different
[2:30] requests here, Lord, that I have here.
[2:33] Uh, Brother Dan Courtney has been sick
[2:36] for with a bad flu, Lord God. There's a
[2:38] lot of flu going around, Lord, but
[2:41] you're our healer, Lord. And and we
[2:43] trust in you in every detail, even small
[2:46] things, big things, large things, Lord.
[2:48] We just trust in you, our wonderful
[2:50] heavenly father. We worship you and
[2:53] praise your wonderful name in the name
[2:55] of Jesus. Hallelujah Lord. And I'm sure
[2:58] there's more requests, Lord. Different
[3:01] people have needs, Lord, this morning. I
[3:04] pray that you would meet every need this
[3:05] morning, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Glory
[3:09] to thy wonderful name. I didn't get all
[3:11] the details of the request, but Lord
[3:13] Jesus, you know every detail. We worship
[3:17] you and we praise you and thank you for
[3:19] that we can be here gathered together as
[3:22] a family of God just worshiping you and
[3:24] glorifying your name because we all have
[3:27] the same names Jesus. And so we thank
[3:31] you for that Lord. Bless our brother
[3:33] Moses Lord as he comes and ministers the
[3:36] word of God. May may have such liberty
[3:39] and may Lord he speak directly to our
[3:42] hearts. Lord, we pray we we believe Lord
[3:44] that you are still speaking through the
[3:47] channel of the ministry.
[3:50] And so we Lord Jesus commit ourselves to
[3:52] you. Bless brother Andrew as he as he
[3:55] leads us in service. May he be led to
[3:58] sing the right songs and may your name
[4:00] be glorified. Hallelujah.
[4:03] Oh hallelujah to your wonderful name.
[4:05] Thank you for saving me. Thank you Lord
[4:07] Jesus for predestinating me before the
[4:10] foundation of the world. We praise you
[4:13] this morning in Jesus name. Amen. And
[4:16] the people said
[4:18] &gt;&gt; isn't Lord wonderful.
[4:24] You can have your seats if you like.
[4:29] We'll sing uh this this next song. Pass
[4:31] me not gentle savior. Then maybe we'll
[4:33] have sister Kathy and sister
[4:40] Pass me not, oh gentle Savior,
[4:48] hear my humble
[4:52] cry.
[4:56] While
[4:57] on others thou are calling,
[5:04] &gt;&gt; do not pass thee by
[5:11] &gt;&gt; Savior.
[5:15] Savior,

[6:04] Help my unavior.

[6:23] cry.
[6:27] While on others thou are called,

[7:47] the Lord
[7:49] of all.
[7:52] Jesus
[7:54] be
[7:56] the Lord
[7:58] of all.
[8:01] The kingoms
[8:03] of
[8:05] my heart.
[8:10] Jesus

[8:35] The kingoms
[8:37] of
[8:39] my heart
[8:45] in my heart
[8:48] are kingdoms
[8:52] of a world
[8:54] that's all
[8:56] my own
[9:01] kingdoms that
[9:04] are only seen
[9:08] by myself
[9:10] and God
[9:13] alone.
[9:16] In the past,
[9:19] when I
[9:21] tried to rule
[9:23] my world,
[9:25] it just seemed to fall
[9:30] aart.
[9:33] So please Jesus
[9:36] be
[9:38] the Lord
[9:40] of all
[9:42] the kingoms
[9:44] of
[9:46] my heart.

[10:05] of all.

[10:09] be
[10:11] the Lord
[10:13] of all
[10:15] the kingoms
[10:17] of
[10:19] my heart.
[10:27] I guess I only
[10:30] f myself
[10:33] when I said that I had yielded
[10:38] it all.
[10:42] Yet in the secret corners of my heart
[10:47] was a kingom
[10:50] that did not fall.
[10:56] I surrender now.
[11:00] Make my heart your throne.
[11:05] Rule its kingoms,
[11:09] great and small.
[11:14] For if you're
[11:17] alone
[11:18] of
[11:20] everything,
[11:22] then you're alone. Lord at all.
[11:31] Jesus
[11:33] I
[11:35] surrender
[11:37] all.
[11:40] Jesus
[11:42] I
[11:43] surrender
[11:46] all.
[11:48] Jesus
[11:50] I
[11:52] surrender
[11:54] all
[11:56] the kingoms
[11:59] of my heart.
[12:05] Jesus
[12:07] be
[12:08] the Lord
[12:11] of all.
[12:13] Jesus
[12:15] be
[12:17] the Lord
[12:19] of all.

[12:25] the Lord
[12:27] of all
[12:29] the kingoms
[12:32] of
[12:34] my heart.
[12:37] For if you're
[12:40] not lord
[12:42] of
[12:44] everything.
[12:46] For if you're
[12:48] not lord
[12:50] of
[12:52] everything.
[12:54] For if you're
[12:56] not lord
[12:58] of
[13:00] everything,
[13:02] then you're
[13:06] not Lord
[13:13] at all.
[13:24] Amen. Thank you.
[13:26] I was just thinking about those some of
[13:28] those songs we we s
[13:31] earlier and it's just you a a lot of
[13:33] times we
[13:37] we we have to have a secret place and
[13:38] then but in that secret place is where
[13:40] we find value and like inside of a bank
[13:44] you have like most banks have like a a
[13:47] vault I guess and you go in there and
[13:49] that's That's where you store everything
[13:50] you have treasure. That's where you go
[13:52] to inspect it.
[13:53] &gt;&gt; And I just Yeah. We want him to be lord
[13:56] of all. We want him to to come and be in
[13:59] that innermost and we can expect inspect
[14:02] those things and we can look at those
[14:03] things and like yes this is this is
[14:05] where my value lies. This is where not
[14:08] just where I store value but the value
[14:10] that's in me is held in that inner
[14:12] place.
[14:17] Who am I Lord? Who am I?

[14:32] and made my heart,
[14:36] his very throne.

[14:51] &gt;&gt; to praise his name.
[14:55] &gt;&gt; Who am I, Lord?
[14:59] Who I am?
[15:02] &gt;&gt; I can see now
[15:06] who I am.
[15:09] I'm a part of my Savior,
[15:13] a part of his word.
[15:17] It's a revelation
[15:20] of who I am. Let's stand
[15:24] on Calary. He died to redeem his lost.
[15:31] The King of Kings,
[15:35] became my Savior.
[15:39] is God's great mystery
[15:42] of love expressed to me that Christ and
[15:47] I
[15:49] might be set free.
[15:53] &gt;&gt; So who am I?

[16:40] prisoner of love divine.
[16:43] And now I live
[16:47] to praise his name.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; Who am I? Lord,
[16:54] who I am.
[16:58] I can see now
[17:02] who I am.
[17:05] I'm a part of my savior,

[29:05] songs,
[29:07] with our amen to the word of God, with
[29:10] our presence here, Lord. And Father,
[29:13] Lord, maybe some also an offerings all
[29:16] this part of part of of worship. Lord,
[29:20] we just want to say thank you, Father,
[29:22] for what you have done for us, Lord.
[29:25] There is nothing we can do Lord to
[29:29] to merit the love that you have you you
[29:32] have displayed or projected towards us
[29:34] but in return we just want to say father
[29:37] to love you we want we love you and we
[29:40] desire to love you more and more father
[29:43] Lord may you come this morning and speak
[29:46] to our heart one word from from you will
[29:48] make a difference as a prophet will say
[29:51] I've preached I've I Ah, I've said what
[29:55] I've said, but one word from the Lord
[29:57] will make a difference.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; As if Moses in the presence of the
[30:01] pillow of fire, just five minutes
[30:03] changed his life the whole life. Father,
[30:06] &gt;&gt; amen.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; Let this morning, Lord, just we spend
[30:09] five minutes in your presence that will
[30:11] change our life, we change our
[30:12] directions, we change our decisions,
[30:15] Lord, we change out the situations in
[30:18] our life, Father. Whatever we are in
[30:19] Lord God we believe are coming in your
[30:22] presence. You will heal the sick. You
[30:24] will touch the heart Lord. You will
[30:27] transform our families. Father will be a
[30:30] special anointing that will sweep this
[30:33] this church will sweep our house will
[30:35] sweep father even our soul as brother
[30:38] expressed it earlier Lord the inner part
[30:40] of our whole being Lord where the
[30:42] treasure of the presence of God shall
[30:44] remain. Father that's where we desire to
[30:46] be. Thank you father for your
[30:48] faithfulness. Lord remember those who
[30:51] are sick those could not make it. May
[30:53] also be with them and touch them. Your
[30:56] presence be with them father. Help me
[30:58] father to deliver the few thoughts that
[31:00] you put in my heart and bless the people
[31:02] as we commit oursel to you in Jesus
[31:04] Christ name we pray. Amen.
[31:09] Amen. Thank you musicians. God bless you
[31:11] richly.
[31:13] Thank you brother Andrew.
[31:15] Peter, brother Caleb.
[31:23] Amen. Invite you to go to the word of
[31:26] God. I'll just touch a little bit
[31:30] on the love of God one more time.
[31:33] is it's a subject we can never finish
[31:35] but
[31:38] might have a little bit of repetition of
[31:40] some of the thoughts but
[31:45] I just thought to myself if it's the
[31:47] most important thing that we need then I
[31:51] think it deserves at least two services
[31:54] on it if it's the most important thing
[31:58] so just let's speak a little bit about
[32:00] it and um
[32:05] Colossians 3. I will read
[32:10] verse 14. I'll let you sit and then I'll
[32:13] read the whole part that I want you to
[32:15] read.
[32:17] Colossians 3 verse 14.
[32:30] Colossians comes up the Philippians and
[32:33] Ephesians and
[32:36] so if you're there Colossians 3 verse 14
[32:39] above all these things so above all
[32:42] these things means there are certain
[32:44] things that are very important are very
[32:46] good but above all those things put on
[32:49] charity which is agapo which is the love
[32:52] of God which is the bond of perfectness
[32:56] the bond of perfection is found into
[33:00] charity. Amen. God bless his word. Can
[33:03] have a seat this morning.
[33:12] Welcome the visitors among us and God
[33:14] bless you richly. I think we have one
[33:17] brother from all our brother Samuel.
[33:20] Where are you? God bless you Richley.
[33:23] Welcome here. Good to have you. I stay
[33:26] where papa mama
[33:29] my mamaishi there god bless them richly
[33:32] and comes from all
[33:36] it's good if you stay longer here
[33:38] brother
[33:41] bless you and also we have brother
[33:44] brother Daniel from
[33:47] now we have to call you from lebridge
[33:48] right used to be from Edmonton now he's
[33:51] from Lebridge so just good to have him
[33:54] god bless him richly keeping keep
[33:57] brother brother Gabriel in prayer and
[34:01] his daughter was just sick and he's been
[34:03] hospital couple of times and yesterday
[34:06] they have to put a little bit of
[34:07] profusion for the daughter but his home
[34:10] has been in contact with him and just
[34:13] keep him in prayer and the family in
[34:16] prayer. My little boy is also sick this
[34:19] morning. He's not feeling well so he
[34:20] stayed home but
[34:23] um the Lord is the healer. Amen.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; Just want to read Colossians 3:105.
[34:35] Bible says and
[34:37] and have put on
[34:40] have put on the new man which is renewed
[34:43] in knowledge after the image of him that
[34:46] created him
[34:48] where there is neither Greek nor Jew
[34:52] circumcision or uncircumcision
[34:54] barbarian
[34:56] skitian or I don't know how to say that
[34:58] but bond or free but Christ is All and
[35:03] all in and in all. Christ is all and in
[35:07] all. Amen.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; So the song said that that we just need
[35:10] him to have the primance. He's the God
[35:12] of all. Want to have the preminence in
[35:15] everything. Amen. Then it says, "Put on
[35:17] therefore as the elect of God, holy and
[35:21] beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness,
[35:25] humbleness of mind, meekness,
[35:28] longsuffering,
[35:30] forbearing one another, and forgiving
[35:33] one another. If any man have a quarrel
[35:36] against any, even as Christ forgave you,
[35:41] so also do ye." This verse is very, very
[35:45] important. I don't think we we are at
[35:47] that level yet or maybe we are there but
[35:50] we need more of that
[35:52] &gt;&gt; where we can forgive as Christ has
[35:54] forgiven us and that's what we have to
[35:57] do. It says above all these things put
[35:59] on charity which is the bond of
[36:01] perfectness and let the peace of God
[36:04] rule in your heart to the which to the
[36:08] which also you are called in one body
[36:10] and be thankful.
[36:13] Let the word of Christ dwell in you
[36:15] richly in all wisdom, teaching and
[36:18] admonishing one another in psalms and
[36:20] hymns and spiritual songs.
[36:30] The name of the Lord Jesus, giving
[36:32] thanks to God and the father by him.
[36:36] Wives, submit yourself unto your own
[36:38] husbands as it is fit in the Lord.
[36:42] Husbands, love your wives. Do not
[36:45] bitter. Do not be and be not bitter
[36:48] against them. Children, obey your
[36:51] parents in all things. And this is well
[36:53] pleasing unto the Lord. Fathers,
[36:56] remember it's not saying mothers, but
[36:58] say fathers, provoke not your children
[37:01] to anger, lest they be discouraged.
[37:04] servant, obey in all things your masters
[37:06] according to the flesh, not with I eye
[37:10] service as man pleasers, but in
[37:12] singleness of heart, fearing God. And
[37:16] whatsoever you do, do it heartly as to
[37:19] the Lord and not unto man, knowing that
[37:22] the Lord is knowing that of the Lord,
[37:25] you shall receive the reward of the
[37:27] inheritance,
[37:28] for you serve the Lord Christ. But he
[37:31] that doeth wrong shall receive for the
[37:34] wrong which he had done and there is no
[37:37] respect of persons. Amen. May God bless
[37:41] his word.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:46] This is just wonderful scripture and the
[37:49] prophet says you know as the Bible says
[37:51] that the absolute we just say amen to
[37:54] the word of God.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; I just want to want to continue and put
[37:57] the title this morning. Charity is the
[37:59] bond of perfectness. Charity is the bond
[38:03] of perfectness
[38:05] as we go through many times and perfect
[38:08] we went through many times with but
[38:10] perfect does not mean that you have you
[38:12] are sinless or in the sense that you
[38:14] have no mistakes no no no failures but
[38:18] as a human being that means you have
[38:20] come to complete you are fulfilled
[38:22] you're fulfilled you're mature uh uh uh
[38:26] per perfectness mean perfection in God's
[38:29] eyes again God looks at you, he sees
[38:32] that you have no sin. As you if you have
[38:34] never sinned and for the past sins, for
[38:38] the present, for the future, but as a as
[38:40] a human beings, we have failures. We
[38:43] fail all time. We die daily. Amen.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; But at least we have to grow. We have to
[38:48] come to the place where we become
[38:50] stable. We become mature. We know where
[38:53] we are. And love is what holds all the
[38:56] virtues together. As they say, Christ
[38:59] charity is the bond of perfectness.
[39:01] Means love is what holds all the virtue
[39:04] together. Is what brings you to
[39:06] maturity. It holds all the different
[39:09] parts of the body together. I would say
[39:11] not only it holds them together but it
[39:13] is also what helps them to grow together
[39:17] and keep them together at the same time.
[39:19] Amen.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:22] I just want to skip few things here but
[39:24] uh just want to get to the place where I
[39:27] have to say um
[39:33] the prophet says somebody told me and
[39:36] say well preacher I don't know the Greek
[39:38] words and I said and I said you you
[39:42] don't know the Bible right so he's
[39:44] claiming to prophet you don't know the
[39:45] Bible right and says if you know the
[39:48] words don't mean this it means that and
[39:51] I said brother I know the author better
[39:53] than I know his book
[39:55] &gt;&gt; says my my problem is not about to know
[39:58] to know the word the letters although
[40:01] it's important part of the st of a
[40:03] perfect man but that should not be that
[40:05] should not be the focus sometimes you
[40:07] think okay you know I know it so well
[40:10] that that know I don't need to learn
[40:12] anything else no it says you need to
[40:14] know the author the author of the word
[40:16] of god that's what is more important
[40:19] listen how the prophet Phet says, "Amen.
[40:21] I rather have the order anyhow, any
[40:23] time. His book is fine. That's right.
[40:26] But I'd rather know the order of the
[40:28] word of God." Wouldn't you? And you know
[40:30] him. How do you know him? You know him
[40:33] by love. You know God by love,
[40:43] the Holy Spirit. I'm just saying we are
[40:46] living off that one thing that's more
[40:48] important than all. It's the love of
[40:50] God. Amen. That make us one one in
[40:54] Christ Jesus. Amen. So the love of God
[40:57] is so important and we need to cry for
[40:59] it. We need to pray for it. We need God
[41:02] give me more of your love than anything
[41:04] else. The pure love of God that only the
[41:07] Holy Spirit can give. That's what I
[41:09] desire. That you give to me the love of
[41:11] God inside of my heart. The love of God
[41:14] is God himself. The love of God is not
[41:16] is not only something that you can
[41:19] learn, something you can practice, not
[41:21] something you can you you can you can
[41:23] even imitate. It's not something you can
[41:25] manufacture. It has to come through the
[41:27] Holy Spirit. Only the Holy Spirit can
[41:29] give you the true love of God in the
[41:31] heart. And that's what we desire. God,
[41:34] fill me with your Holy Spirit and let it
[41:36] create the love of God inside of my
[41:38] heart. And it will be manifested itself
[41:41] by the way I speak, the way I love you,
[41:43] the way I dedicate myself, the way the
[41:46] the way I'm in connection. I desire the
[41:48] fellowship with you. That's how the love
[41:50] of God is going to be manifested. How I
[41:52] forgive my brother. I forgive my sister.
[41:55] I want the love of God to take over over
[41:58] then and then my than my emotion, then
[42:00] my feeling, then my thinking, than my my
[42:02] my lecturing, than my theology. I want
[42:05] the love of God to have the full
[42:07] preminence. Are you with me this
[42:08] morning?
[42:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; I believe it's the desire as well. The
[42:12] prophet says, the Bible says, the Bible
[42:14] says Israel knew the works of God, but
[42:17] they did not know his ways. That's what
[42:20] the Bible says. It says Psalm 103 says,
[42:23] "The Lord exe executive righteousness
[42:25] and judgment for all that oppressed. He
[42:28] made known his ways unto Moses, his act
[42:31] unto the children of Israel." So God
[42:33] made his ways unto Moses and his act
[42:37] unto the children of Israel. The Lord is
[42:39] merciful and gracious, slow to anger and
[42:42] planters in mercy. I will say is Israel
[42:45] the people they knew exactly what the
[42:48] works of God. They knew the miracles.
[42:50] They saw the deliverances. They saw how
[42:53] God
[42:55] displayed his power through Moses. They
[42:57] saw the the the 10 plagues. They they
[43:00] saw all the miracles, the mighty. It was
[43:02] actually the creative word of God. It
[43:04] will create the flies. It will create
[43:06] recre.
[43:09] THEY SAW THAT THEY THEY EXPERIENCED IT.
[43:11] THEY they they saw the work of God. They
[43:14] saw the Red Sea being split. Amen. They
[43:16] saw how they walked they walked through
[43:19] dry land through the Red Sea. They saw
[43:20] the Egyptian to drown. They saw the when
[43:24] they on the other side they saw the the
[43:26] word of marriage it was beaten. It
[43:28] became sweet. They saw all the great
[43:30] things. Amen. But they didn't know they
[43:33] still did not understand the way of God.
[43:36] They don't understand the ways of God.
[43:38] So we we don't I pray that we we we
[43:41] don't just stay and look at the works of
[43:43] God and we don't understand the heart of
[43:46] God. The heart of GOD IS LOVE. AMEN. THE
[43:49] HEART OF GOD IS FORGIVENESS. The heart
[43:51] of God is mercy. The heart of God is
[43:54] redemption. THE HEART OF GOD IS TO come
[43:56] to relationship WITH HIM. AMEN. THAT
[43:59] THAT'S ALL THAT GOD IS DOING. GOD ALL
[44:01] GOD HAS HAS DONE EVEN IN LIFE of brother
[44:03] Bon in the first pool in the second pool
[44:06] EVEN IN THE THIRD POOL THE opening of
[44:07] the word IS ALL THE DESIRE IS TO EXPRESS
[44:10] HIS LOVE. GOD WANT THAT LOVE TO THAT FOR
[44:13] us to understand his love. Amen. To have
[44:16] the revelation of his love but ALSO NOT
[44:18] THAT ONLY the love to stay to him. He
[44:20] want that love to come into our heart.
[44:23] ISRAEL SAW THAT THEY SAW THE MIRACLES
[44:25] but they didn't understand the way of
[44:27] God. But listen to how the prophet God
[44:30] gave the the the the the promise to the
[44:32] prophet says because that has chosen the
[44:35] narrow path, the hard way that hath
[44:39] walked in your own choosing that has
[44:41] picked the correct and precise decision.
[44:44] The prophet say at many places I think
[44:47] would say no Moses had to make his own
[44:49] choice. Amen. He had to to choose and he
[44:52] had to he had to say no. You know what I
[44:54] I appreciate the word of God. I
[44:56] appreciate Christ. I take the reproach
[44:58] of Christ more than the the riches of of
[45:01] Egypt. I accept what the word of God
[45:03] says more than the riches of Egypt. And
[45:06] the and the prophet had to make also a
[45:07] choice and he made the hard choice. He
[45:10] says that he picked out the correct and
[45:12] precise decision and it is my way.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; How many wants God's way?
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; I want God's way. This and God says this
[45:22] is my way. It might be hard. IT MIGHT BE
[45:24] HARSH. IT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT. But as
[45:27] long as it's God's way, I want to stay
[45:29] in God's way.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; So because of this momentous decision, a
[45:34] huge portion of heaven will await thee.
[45:38] What of a glorious decision that has
[45:40] made this in itself that which is will
[45:43] give and may come to pass the tremendous
[45:46] victory in the love divine.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; HOW WE GOING TO HAVE THE VICTORY in
[45:51] time? Through the love divine. THROUGH
[45:55] THE DECISION that you are making by
[45:57] staying God's way and the love divine is
[46:00] going to take the preminence in our
[46:02] life. Amen. I'll say this. HOW MANY HAVE
[46:04] CHOSEN the Lord Jesus Christ by the way
[46:06] of this message?
[46:08] &gt;&gt; How many has accepted the Lord Jesus
[46:10] Christ? Say God I thank you for the
[46:12] message of the hour. I thank you FOR THE
[46:14] WORD OF GOD. I THANK YOU FOR THE
[46:16] UNVEILING OF GOD. I THANK YOU FOR THE
[46:19] INVISIBLE UNION. THANK GOD FOR THE WAY
[46:21] OF GOD. I THANK YOU FOR YOU COMING DOWN
[46:24] TO MY LEVEL. I THANK YOU FOR THE BLOOD
[46:26] OF JESUS CHRIST. I THANK YOU FOR THE
[46:29] BLEEDING WORD. AMEN.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; This message of the living truth to the
[46:34] whole Bible is not sometimes an easy
[46:37] way. Sometimes it is a hard way. In the
[46:40] midst of the Leodyian age, we are
[46:43] fighting a battle. We are fighting a
[46:45] battle in Laia where
[46:49] the trend of Laia is pushing in one way
[46:52] and you have to find your own way
[46:54] through that which is not your own way.
[46:56] It's actually God's way.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; But it's harder. IT'S GETTING HARDER AND
[47:00] HARDER. IT'S GETTING HARDER AND HARDER.
[47:02] ONLY THE LOVE OF GOD is going to
[47:04] prevail. Amen.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; But you have made the right choice
[47:09] because of that decision. This message
[47:12] will bring to pass the tremendous
[47:14] victory in love divine. You can receive
[47:17] your healing in this in this tremendous
[47:20] victory in love divine. How many believe
[47:22] that is God the god of paradox?
[47:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Our God is a god of paradox.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; As I was listening to the message of
[47:30] love or the message of brother love and
[47:33] I've just as I've just been been on it
[47:35] and he's just been speaking to my taking
[47:37] simple examples just simple example. You
[47:40] see that the aposum that came to me came
[47:42] to me that a person had the revelation
[47:45] of the word of God revelation of the
[47:47] prophet of the age the revelation of the
[47:50] gift that God has given in our time that
[47:53] and if an animal that doesn't have a
[47:55] soul could have revelation of where the
[47:58] gift of God was.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Oh how much more a human being with a
[48:03] soul should have the revelation of where
[48:06] the gift of God is. that opposome
[48:09] recognize it and because of the love
[48:11] that she had for her own children, God
[48:13] says God's love was projected and God's
[48:16] grace had to come and intervene. Amen.
[48:19] If God's love was projected in an animal
[48:22] and it produced healing, how much more
[48:25] the love of God, if it is projected on a
[48:28] human being, can it produce healing IN
[48:30] OUR BODIES? AMEN. CAN IT PRODUCE HEALING
[48:33] IN OUR MIND? THE GOD IS STILL THE SAME
[48:36] YESTERDAY, today and forever. THOSE ARE
[48:39] NOT ONLY STORIES. THEY ARE REALITY.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE SAME MESSAGE THAT WE HAVE
[48:44] RECEIVED. IT SHOULD have it has the same
[48:46] power. OH GOD, HELP US TO CHANGE our
[48:49] attitude and to take you at your WORD TO
[48:52] ACCEPT THE LOVE OF GOD THAT HAS BEEN
[48:54] PROJECTING OUR AGE. THANK GOD FOR THE
[48:57] GIFT YOU HAVE SENT, BUT THANK GOD FOR
[48:59] THE WORD OF GOD THAT YOU HAVE SENT
[49:01] because the word of God is the love of
[49:03] God expressed. Amen.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; You see that we take another example
[49:07] example of the of of brother Bert and
[49:09] went and him and
[49:12] hunting for the brother Bert but about
[49:14] was a cruel man
[49:16] &gt;&gt; and and nothing could change him. He saw
[49:18] he saw things he saw different things.
[49:20] So evangelist evangelizing to him but
[49:23] that couldn't change his heart. His
[49:24] heart was just so hard. But one time he
[49:27] went with the prophet and I like
[49:29] sometime the attitude of the prophet. He
[49:31] didn't know he's an unbeliever and no he
[49:33] sometimes he he knew that God would work
[49:36] with him somehow.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; God has a different god is gods of
[49:39] paradox. Amen. As he goes through there
[49:42] and and he he has his whistle and
[49:44] brother saying you you can't use that
[49:46] whistle because he was just mean just
[49:48] killing all the animals just for fun
[49:50] sometimes to hurt the prophet and
[49:52] because he was a Christian. You are just
[49:54] you're so tender. When God is in your
[49:56] heart, you become tender. Sometimes you
[49:59] know small things that other people
[50:01] don't see, but you just become small.
[50:03] Even even to animals, I can't just kill
[50:05] any animal. No, you you you kill him if
[50:08] you only if you want if you have to eat
[50:09] it. Just don't kill it for the for fun.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; But the prophet has that sensitivity. I
[50:16] think the Holy Ghost has that
[50:17] sensitivity. Amen. Just kill. I don't
[50:19] kill just for the sake of killing. and
[50:21] and and he went there and and and
[50:24] brother Bird uh they were looking for
[50:26] for for hunting and they couldn't find
[50:28] so he had to blow his whistle and blew
[50:30] his whistle and a little phone came out
[50:34] a little animal came out. Amen. And uh
[50:38] and and the mother the mother door came
[50:40] out looking for the little one because
[50:42] he was looking for the baby. Amen. and
[50:45] he came out and see us looking for the
[50:47] baby
[50:49] and brother Bird saw this my occasion in
[50:51] two
[50:53] young young sisters young brothers these
[50:56] are not old stories there's a reality
[50:59] behind it
[51:01] &gt;&gt; and he took the his gun and okay I'm
[51:05] going to charge and that mother doll is
[51:07] not running away and brother Bam says
[51:10] that that's not normal normally that
[51:12] that animal has to run away and they
[51:15] don't even come but during that time
[51:17] they don't come out but that one could
[51:19] not go could not run away why because he
[51:22] had a love for the baby that the love of
[51:25] a mother for the baby this we are
[51:27] talking about an animal that doesn't
[51:30] have a soul
[51:32] even an animal that doesn't have a soul
[51:34] can still have the love of God expressed
[51:37] at this level amen because still still
[51:40] is the creation of God expressed at this
[51:42] level I'm If that could express on that,
[51:45] how much should it be on a human being?
[51:48] &gt;&gt; As brother Bird looked at and and charge
[51:51] on the mother say he's going to blow his
[51:53] heart. The prophet says, "I don't want
[51:54] to look at it." And and brother Bird and
[51:58] try to charge doesn't go. Try to charge
[52:00] doesn't go. Says, "No, this is something
[52:04] more powerful."
[52:05] &gt;&gt; He threw his gun. Said, "Brother,
[52:08] brother Branam, can you pray for me? I
[52:09] give my heart to the Lord Jesus Christ."
[52:11] Amen.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Why did he give his heart to the Lord
[52:14] Jesus Christ? Prophet say because he saw
[52:16] something genuine.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Something real, something that you you
[52:21] can't put on that door. You can't you
[52:23] can't put you can't you can't you can't
[52:25] manufacture it. It has to come from the
[52:27] inside. Just become something real.
[52:30] LORD, I WANT something real in MY HEART.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT SOMETHING TO put on. I
[52:35] don't want something to imitate. I want
[52:37] something real from heart. People are
[52:40] dying for the real love of God. For the
[52:44] reality of the love of God in the heart.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; No one know the prophet who referred to
[52:58] Moses.
[53:01] When Israel sinned against God by taking
[53:04] the idol, God was about to wipe them
[53:07] away. In Exodus 32
[53:11] verse 30 says, "It came to pass on the
[53:13] tomorrow that Moses said unto the
[53:14] people, you have seen the great scene,
[53:17] and now I will go up unto the Lord, but
[53:20] eventually I shall make an atonement for
[53:22] your sin." And Moses returned unto the
[53:24] Lord and said, "Oh, these people have
[53:26] seen the great sin and have made them
[53:28] gods of gold. And now yet now if thou w
[53:31] forgive thy sin and if not blow me blot
[53:35] me I pray thee out of thy book without
[53:38] which thou hast written. And the Lord
[53:40] said unto Moses, "Whosoever had sinned
[53:43] against me, him will I blot out of my
[53:45] book."
[53:47] I believe Moses knew the way of God. He
[53:51] didn't only see the works of God, but he
[53:54] knew the way of God. He knew the very
[53:58] love of God, the very heart of God. As
[54:00] the prophet will say, only the prophet
[54:03] could say that says, "How come I used to
[54:05] wonder I used to wonder how Moses could
[54:08] give God a better idea than God
[54:11] himself?"
[54:13] How could God how could Moses bring to
[54:15] God something to the point where God had
[54:17] to come and repent and repent of what he
[54:20] was about to do? Let's just go through
[54:22] that to a little minute. The prophet
[54:23] says in the soul that in prison now the
[54:25] ministry of Jesus Christ reincarnated in
[54:28] his church in these last days
[54:31] is a wonderful God. The ministry of
[54:34] Jesus Christ reincarnated in his church
[54:36] in these last days. So we have not only
[54:38] we have not we have not received only a
[54:42] ministry uh that is similar to the
[54:44] ministry of Jesus Christ but we have
[54:46] received the ministry of Jesus Christ
[54:49] reincarnated in the church in this last
[54:52] days.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Why? To bring us to the statue of the
[54:55] perfect man. There's nothing that can
[54:57] give you that can bring you higher than
[55:00] what is come to visit you. If a ministry
[55:03] comes and visit that generation is to
[55:06] bring that generation to the statue of
[55:08] what the ministry was brought to. Amen.
[55:10] Are you following that principle? If
[55:12] they come Luther come with justification
[55:14] is to bring the age to justification.
[55:17] Amen. If Wesley come with sanctification
[55:19] is to bring the is to bring the church
[55:21] to sanctification. If a brother banham
[55:24] came the first pool and the second pool
[55:26] to bring to the bring to the the gift to
[55:28] the to the gift of Pentecost to the TO
[55:30] THE BROTHERLY LOVE it's because the
[55:32] church has to come to that statue of the
[55:34] per to that statue that God wanted FOR
[55:36] THAT AGE. NOW IF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST
[55:39] COMES amen through the word of God how
[55:41] many believe that lord the word of God
[55:43] is Jesus Christ. If the ministry of
[55:45] Jesus CHRIST HAS BEEN DISPLAYED ONE MORE
[55:47] TIME IS TO BRING THE BRIDE TO come to
[55:50] the stem statue. Amen. so that we can
[55:52] become the the chief THE MASTERPIECE TO
[55:55] BECOME THE REFLECTION of Jesus Christ TO
[55:58] COME TO THE STATUE OF JESUS CHRIST. THE
[56:00] BRIDE HAS TO BE AT THE SAME level as
[56:04] Jesus CHRIST
[56:05] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE FOR THE RAPTURE TO HAPPEN YOU
[56:08] HAVE TO BECOME THE WORD AS HE IS THE
[56:10] WORD. SO WE THANK GOD FOR THE VISITATION
[56:13] OF THE MINISTRY OF JESUS CHRIST. IT'S
[56:16] NOT ONLY THE MINISTRY OF A MAN. IS not
[56:18] the MINISTRY OF A PROPHET BUT IS THE
[56:20] MINISTRY OF THE SON OF MAN. THAT'S WHY
[56:23] IT IS A SON OF MAN REVEALING THE SON OF
[56:26] MAN. THE SON OF MAN HAS TO TAKE A VESSEL
[56:29] in order for him TO SPEAK TO THE BRIDE
[56:32] TO BRING THE BRIDE AT THE SAME level
[56:34] that himself is. Amen. So that the
[56:37] rapture can take away THE MAGNET. THE
[56:40] BIG MAGNET HAS ALREADY STARTED COMING.
[56:42] AMEN. IT'S NOT A MAN WHO CALLED YOU.
[56:44] It's not a minister called you. IS THE
[56:46] CALLING OF THE BRIDE TO THE BRIDEGROOM
[56:49] HIMSELF AND HIMSELF IS CALLING YOU.
[56:52] AMEN. The Lord Jesus Christ.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Just one statement but just powerful
[56:57] statement.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; The ministry of Jesus Christ
[57:00] reincarnated in this church in this last
[57:02] day.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; So the third pool it was not the opening
[57:08] of the word getting away with my note
[57:10] but I think just put it an opportunity.
[57:13] the opening of the word
[57:16] to open the seals. It's not brother Bam
[57:19] who open the seals
[57:22] because only the lamp could open the
[57:24] seals.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Banam himself and you
[57:27] say be spiritual here. He go and studies
[57:30] he will prepare and then put his and he
[57:32] put his notes together. You read and put
[57:34] all the things together and that was the
[57:37] that was the man's anointing. That what
[57:39] he could have done. But when the angel
[57:42] come down and give him the revelation
[57:45] says no I would have made a big mistake
[57:49] if the angel didn't come
[57:51] &gt;&gt; if the mighty angel didn't come and
[57:53] reveal the thought for the bride because
[57:56] this ministry is not about is not even
[57:58] not a ministry only only of a
[58:01] or say it's not a ministry only an
[58:03] evangelist for the ministry of an of a
[58:05] of a local prophet but the ministry of
[58:08] God himself using a vessel that God
[58:12] could express himself.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; That's the message we HAVE RECEIVED.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR THE MESSAGE of the hour.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Bring it to the bride to the stature of
[58:21] a perfect man.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; That's what many of us believe. He says,
[58:25] "I believe with you. I believe this. If
[58:27] I didn't believe it, I didn't do
[58:29] something else about it." Because after
[58:31] all, that's that's concerning here. If
[58:33] the spirit of God, the spirit of God be
[58:36] in you, you are concerned about the
[58:38] people. That was a scripture that also
[58:41] puzzled me how that Moses could tell God
[58:44] a better idea than God had. Till I found
[58:46] out that it was the spirit of Christ in
[58:49] Moses.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; God said, "Moses, separate yourself from
[58:54] them. I'll destroy the whole thing and
[58:56] start with you." And he said, "Lord," he
[58:58] throwed himself in the bridge and said,
[59:00] "Take me. Blot out my name." Of these
[59:03] very people that had rebelled, his heart
[59:06] went for them. When a minister that got
[59:08] the people in his heart, how could he
[59:10] ever feel justified to my and an
[59:13] infinite sentence say before God or to
[59:15] myself to ever hold anything back from a
[59:18] people that you love better than you
[59:20] love yourself? How could a man take a
[59:23] person into the church by a hand join or
[59:26] some sprinkle, some false baptism or
[59:28] something? Let them lay under the
[59:30] influence of a liar and know the Bible
[59:32] less there and say he loves the person
[59:35] and said though I have to beg for my
[59:38] living whatever it is let me be honest
[59:40] honest with God and with the people to
[59:43] tell them the truth never let me be a
[59:45] deceiver how can I deceive who I live I
[59:48] love though I have to hurt them yet I
[59:52] love them that's the reason you spank
[59:54] your child it's because you love him not
[59:57] because you don't like him because you
[59:59] love him. If he's wrong, you'll get
[1:00:01] killed if you don't correct him. Amen.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; So Moses many good principle on that.
[1:00:08] God Moses had to step in on the bridge
[1:00:10] for others. That's the love of God. The
[1:00:13] love of God can never wish someone to be
[1:00:16] to to be lost. If no matter what the
[1:00:19] person has done to you, no matter what
[1:00:20] what disagreement you have, no matter
[1:00:23] HOW CRUEL THEY HAVE to be to they have
[1:00:25] been to you, you can never wish someone
[1:00:27] else to be lost. There will always be a
[1:00:30] desire for that person to be saved. You
[1:00:33] will do everything for that person to be
[1:00:35] saved because if Christ inside of you,
[1:00:38] you will have the desire for redemption
[1:00:40] FOR SOMEONE ELSE. AMEN. MAY GOD HELP US
[1:00:43] TO HAVE THE ATTITUDE. LORD, give me SO
[1:00:45] MUCH OF YOUR LOVE TO THE POINT EVEN ON
[1:00:48] LOVING MY enemies because I want his
[1:00:50] salvation. Let me even be able to stay
[1:00:53] IN THE BRIDGE AND ACCEPT EVERYTHING
[1:00:56] BECAUSE I want his redemption. I WANT
[1:00:58] HER REDEMPTION. IF YOU DIED FOR ME, HELP
[1:01:00] ME TO DIE FOR SOMEONE ELSE. LORD, GIVE
[1:01:03] ME THAT HEART THAT CAN STAND IN THE
[1:01:05] BRIDGE FOR SOMEONE ELSE. THOSE ARE
[1:01:06] PEOPLE WHO WERE SO HARD on Moses. So
[1:01:09] hard ON MOSES. BUT IN THAT TIME THAT
[1:01:12] WERE ABOUT TO BE DESTROYED, MOSES STOOD
[1:01:14] AND STANDING AND PREACH. OH GOD, INSTEAD
[1:01:17] OF KILLING THEM, KILL ME, LORD. KILL ME.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; And God himself look at that says, "No,
[1:01:26] that actually my representation of my of
[1:01:28] myself."
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Look in the Bible. God repented. Mhm.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; One minister says
[1:01:37] you can bring God to repentance. I don't
[1:01:40] have that boldness to say but it was
[1:01:42] just nice the way he put it. So you can
[1:01:44] BRING GOD TO REPENT. THE BIBLE SAYS GOD
[1:01:46] REPENTED. IF GOD REPENTED, WHAT CAN MAKE
[1:01:49] GOD REPENT? THE WORD of God. But
[1:01:52] actually is a little bit right. If you
[1:01:54] take the word of God to God, God cannot
[1:01:56] deny his own word.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; God will always GO WITH HIS OWN WORD.
[1:02:01] THANK GOD FOR THE WORD OF THE HOUR.
[1:02:03] THAT'S WHY THE CAPSTONE CAME THE OPENING
[1:02:05] OF THE WORD SO THAT WE KNOW THE MIND OF
[1:02:08] CHRIST. We know THE WORD OF GOD. WE KNOW
[1:02:11] WHAT HE WANTS. AMEN.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; But at the same time, the prophet says,
[1:02:16] "Sometimes I can be hard.
[1:02:19] But it's not because I hate you, but
[1:02:21] because I love you."
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Love of God sometimes can be or not.
[1:02:26] Sometimes the love of God is corrective
[1:02:28] all the time.
[1:02:33] Let me just put a little bit of note on
[1:02:35] that. The reason sometimes people think
[1:02:38] I get rough with people bowling them out
[1:02:40] is not because I don't love you. It's
[1:02:42] because I do love you.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; What if your little boy was sitting out
[1:02:46] in the street and you said, "Junior,
[1:02:48] dear, you know, it's okay. You cannot
[1:02:51] say it's fine. You shouldn't sit out
[1:02:53] there. You know, daddy don't want you."
[1:02:56] No, you better you you better you better
[1:03:00] strip the and the prophet says, "No, you
[1:03:02] better strip the hide off of him if you
[1:03:04] love him."
[1:03:06] I wanted to say a soft way, but say you
[1:03:09] BETTER STRIP THE HIDE OFF OF HIM IF you
[1:03:11] love him.
[1:03:13] Keep him off of that street. Real love
[1:03:16] is corrective. Genuine love is
[1:03:19] corrective.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. What if your wife was running
[1:03:22] around with some other man and you say
[1:03:24] you know de I hope you had a good time
[1:03:28] but uh really I don't think uh you
[1:03:30] should do it you know honey I love you
[1:03:34] so the brother says if you have that
[1:03:37] attitude but himself say she ought to
[1:03:40] kick you out of the door
[1:03:44] real love is corrective
[1:03:46] and places a posterior pro protolasma
[1:03:49] stimul ulation is that way the way it's
[1:03:52] pronounced he say that what it would be
[1:03:54] if that was sometimes you have to give
[1:03:56] the church not because you don't like
[1:03:58] junior but because you do like junior
[1:04:01] love is corrective and Jesus wasn't evil
[1:04:04] with them he loved them he must correct
[1:04:06] them
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; so I'm putting this I don't want to just
[1:04:10] just just just to put it in maybe in a
[1:04:13] carnal way but I say put it spiritually
[1:04:17] speaking I thank God for the word of
[1:04:19] God.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Because the word of God corrects me.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; He doesn't want God the God doesn't want
[1:04:25] me to stay in error.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; God doesn't want me to continue in that
[1:04:29] error in that ignorance. No. The love of
[1:04:32] God came to me to help me to change my
[1:04:35] direction because God loves me. God want
[1:04:39] to correct us in a nice way with love.
[1:04:42] We we with with the right attitude. The
[1:04:45] correction of God is not for judgment.
[1:04:47] Is not for condemnation. is not to put
[1:04:49] you down. Is not is not to show you that
[1:04:52] you are nothing. The correction of God
[1:04:54] is to bring you to the la to to the
[1:04:56] revelation of how much he loves you
[1:04:58] because he does not want to lose you.
[1:05:01] Amen. The same thing for us our parents.
[1:05:03] You don't chastise your child just for
[1:05:05] the sake of chastising him. Sometimes
[1:05:07] you chastise HIM AND YOU KNOW HOW
[1:05:09] sometimes if you have had the Holy
[1:05:10] Spirit you don't just you know sometimes
[1:05:13] let me just you know put you in the door
[1:05:15] that's opening. You don't correct them.
[1:05:17] Sometime we don't correct your children
[1:05:18] when we are an under anger
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; anger
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; anger and hunger both maybe
[1:05:27] don't do that
[1:05:29] don't do that
[1:05:31] because you might correct him more than
[1:05:33] than than it than than he should. Right?
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; The right attitude sometimes you you
[1:05:39] calm down
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; calm down. Okay here my nerves my temper
[1:05:44] is just calm down. You might even some
[1:05:47] attitude I'm shout some you know you
[1:05:49] have little kids sometime you shout and
[1:05:51] then but you take your time and then
[1:05:54] after you call him you talk to him say
[1:05:56] you know I'm going to punish you because
[1:05:58] of this this this because it's not it's
[1:06:01] it's not the punishment or how hard it
[1:06:05] is that make them change
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; is the attitude is make them understand
[1:06:12] is the love that you express to them
[1:06:15] then they will correct themselves. Amen.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Sometimes sometimes sometimes you know
[1:06:20] how hard you beat them but
[1:06:24] you need to have a little bit of wisdom
[1:06:26] just the door that's open you know I did
[1:06:28] not prepare that but on this way but a
[1:06:30] little bit of wisd use a little bit of
[1:06:32] wisdom God help me to help me to talk to
[1:06:35] him. My Paul David is the hardest. When
[1:06:39] he was younger, he will, you know, you
[1:06:42] hit him. Other times, even Is he
[1:06:46] sleeping? Yeah, he's awake.
[1:06:49] Sometimes he does something wrong. He's
[1:06:51] even bringing you what you are going to
[1:06:53] hit him with
[1:06:58] because that's not what is changing him.
[1:07:01] That's not changing me, daddy. Then you
[1:07:04] don't know what to do if you because
[1:07:09] Then you have to find another way. God's
[1:07:12] grace. But you want him to be better.
[1:07:14] It's not it's not you don't punish him
[1:07:16] just for the sake of punishing or
[1:07:18] hitting him hard. It's the love of God.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; There is no not there is nothing of such
[1:07:23] great power, such great force than the
[1:07:26] love of God.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:38] Oh, praise be to God. There's so many
[1:07:40] things we can say on the love of God.
[1:07:41] But
[1:07:46] prophet says
[1:07:49] Moses threw himself in the path of God's
[1:07:51] rife. Take me and not the people that he
[1:07:53] had called rebels. Rebellion against God
[1:07:56] and against him. Yet he loved them so
[1:07:58] much till he said, "Take me. Save save
[1:08:01] them." That was Christ in Moses. If a
[1:08:04] man, no matter how much some other one
[1:08:06] would disagree with him, if he doesn't
[1:08:09] feel that way, then there is a lacking
[1:08:11] of Christ. I believe it's from the from
[1:08:14] his heart. Not his lips, but from his
[1:08:16] heart. If he doesn't feel that way
[1:08:18] towards humanity. So I'll say agap love
[1:08:21] is not manifested when people are in one
[1:08:23] accord with you. When everything is
[1:08:25] fine. Is not when you test and see if
[1:08:27] agap love is there.
[1:08:30] Love is tested and manifested when
[1:08:32] things go wrong. When you don't see the
[1:08:34] same way. Amen. When things when when
[1:08:38] people hurt you, when something is is
[1:08:40] going against your per your will, then
[1:08:43] that's when you see the manifestation of
[1:08:45] agapa or love. As we see the story of
[1:08:47] Joseph, it shows it so well. He heard
[1:08:50] them discussing how they kill, how they
[1:08:52] will kill him, how they wanted to kill
[1:08:53] him. He heard them, he heard them, they
[1:08:56] were doing all these things. He saw them
[1:08:58] how they were selling him, how they were
[1:09:00] mocking him. We receive if your dream is
[1:09:02] going to be manifested. We receive that
[1:09:04] if you see what you have been telling
[1:09:05] us, you're going to be manifested. BUT
[1:09:07] EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE SELLING HIM, THEY
[1:09:09] WERE PUTTING HIM AWAY. MAN, GOD WAS
[1:09:12] FULFILLING the same dream. IT WAS THE
[1:09:14] WAY OF GOD TO FULFILL THAT SAME DREAM.
[1:09:17] BUT WHEN GOD WHEN GOD PUT JOSEPH at the
[1:09:20] right position, you see Joseph didn't
[1:09:22] keep any bitterness against his brother.
[1:09:25] God. Joseph forgave his brother. Joseph
[1:09:28] manifested to them the perfect love of
[1:09:30] God. The prophet would say Joseph was a
[1:09:33] type of perfection. Perfection. Oh, let
[1:09:36] him say perfection doesn't mean that you
[1:09:37] don't have any sin, but perfection SHOWS
[1:09:39] MATURITY. JOSEPH UNDERSTOOD AND TOLD HIS
[1:09:42] BROTHER, YOU THOUGHT EVIL AGAINST ME,
[1:09:45] BUT GOD meant unto good to bring to pass
[1:09:48] in these days to save much people alive.
[1:09:51] A mature Christians doesn't doesn't
[1:09:54] discern things or judge things by the
[1:09:57] circumstances. A mature Christian knows
[1:10:00] that God is in control of every
[1:10:02] situation. SO YOU DON'T RESPOND EVIL
[1:10:05] WITH EVIL. YOU DON'T RESPOND HURT WITH
[1:10:08] HURT, BUT YOU RESPOND TO ANYTHING
[1:10:10] NEGATIVE. YOU RESPOND WITH THE LOVE OF
[1:10:12] GOD BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE LOVE
[1:10:15] OF GOD IS ABOVE ANYTHING. YOU UNDERSTAND
[1:10:18] THAT GOD IS IN CONTROL OF EVERYTHING.
[1:10:20] AMEN. AS THE PROPHET SAYS, LOVE, GOD'S
[1:10:23] LOVE, love is the most powerful thing
[1:10:26] that there is in the world. IT CONQUERS
[1:10:29] ANYTHING. IT CONQUERS ANYTHING IS LOVE.
[1:10:32] But if you shall conquer by love,
[1:10:34] divine, loving one another, loving the
[1:10:37] cause of God, loving Christ, loving
[1:10:40] suffering humanity. That is how YOU
[1:10:42] CONQUER. HOW CAN YOU CONQUER? By the
[1:10:45] love of God. God, give me more of your
[1:10:47] love. Amen.
[1:10:51] always like this storyendo
[1:10:54] spoke on it on the respect
[1:10:58] prophet says in respect you can't
[1:11:00] disrespect God you have to respect God
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; if you don't believe it just keep still
[1:11:07] keep away from it or either do that or
[1:11:10] some reverent come reverently and
[1:11:13] respect it don't make fun of people in
[1:11:15] the spirit don't talk about people that
[1:11:17] worshiping in the spirit of God. Laid
[1:11:20] I'm alone. I was standing right there in
[1:11:23] the corner preaching some years ago as a
[1:11:25] boy preacher and there was a woman came
[1:11:27] by and she was Catholic by faith and I
[1:11:29] know her. Her her husband was Catholic.
[1:11:31] She wasn't nothing. Say very handsome,
[1:11:34] pretty woman, nicel looking about 20
[1:11:36] years old, 22. I knew her as a girl here
[1:11:39] in the city. So she came by and stood
[1:11:41] there and said I wouldn't let my pet cow
[1:11:44] have that religion that William
[1:11:46] Branham's God.
[1:11:50] And the next night, the next night
[1:11:52] before I could get to her, I heard she
[1:11:55] was dying in the hospital.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; And I don't know yet what killed her.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; She was dying down there in the hospital
[1:12:01] and husband came came to get me. And he
[1:12:05] said he was a Catholic and he came and
[1:12:07] said, "Come quickly, say a prayer for my
[1:12:10] wife. She's been calling for you all
[1:12:12] evening. She's dying."
[1:12:15] She was disrespectful towards God's
[1:12:18] servant
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; and and God struck her
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; and and she was dying and then she
[1:12:24] realized
[1:12:26] when her senses
[1:12:28] you know she used to think she was
[1:12:30] intelligent and everything and it
[1:12:32] doesn't even if she had a a a pet cow
[1:12:34] she would allow to listen to that kind
[1:12:36] of but when at the time of death she
[1:12:38] start thinking oh oh now realize I made
[1:12:42] a mistake
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; oh uh call call that man of God and call
[1:12:46] that she become desperate she become
[1:12:48] desperate
[1:12:50] but as negative this story is and but I
[1:12:53] I like the portion of the prophet part
[1:12:56] his attitude
[1:12:58] when they called him he didn't stay and
[1:13:00] say you know what you know she deserve
[1:13:03] what she did you know that's a problem
[1:13:05] that that that that you know she she get
[1:13:08] she get what she she sold and no as they
[1:13:11] called him he RUSHED HE RUSHED RUN. He
[1:13:15] did ALL HIS BEST TO GET AT THE PLACE
[1:13:18] BEFORE SHE DIED. And that's the
[1:13:20] expression OF THE LOVE OF GOD. NO MATTER
[1:13:22] WHAT HOW HARD SHE WAS ON HIM, NO MATTER
[1:13:25] WHAT SHE DID, NOT THE MISTAKE WHAT SHE
[1:13:26] MADE, GOD, HE RAN, HE RAN, HE RAN.
[1:13:31] But unfortunately before arrived there,
[1:13:33] she already passed.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; They say, "Oh, God." And the husband
[1:13:37] says, "But still pray for now." They say
[1:13:39] it won't make any different because she
[1:13:41] already passed. But still the attitude
[1:13:44] was not to leave her alone you not to
[1:13:46] say no you know he criticizes me he said
[1:13:49] something bad about me or the thing then
[1:13:51] you know I can't I I don't no still God
[1:13:54] give me that love that I can still go
[1:13:56] towards him I can still stay in the
[1:13:59] bridge for him I can still pray for him
[1:14:01] I can still pray for her amen
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; that's WHAT THE MESSAGE CAME TO do
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; amen Amen.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; For me, the best definition agap love is
[1:14:17] the ability or
[1:14:19] the love God gives a person to desire
[1:14:22] salvation for another person despite any
[1:14:26] other external circumstances.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; As long as there have a breath of life,
[1:14:33] I want him to be saved. I want her to be
[1:14:36] saved. Amen.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Talking the experience of the other side
[1:14:40] says I felt something lick my hand in
[1:14:42] the fifth seal. There was my old kund
[1:14:45] dog Mr. Short. Mr. Short poisoned him. I
[1:14:50] saw I saw that
[1:14:54] I would kill Mr. Short for it.
[1:14:57] I was about 16 years old. He poisoned
[1:15:00] him. He gave him a dog button and my
[1:15:03] daddy caught me with a rife going down
[1:15:05] to shoot him. right in the police
[1:15:07] station. I said, "I'll kill him." I went
[1:15:10] over to the dog's grave. I buried him. I
[1:15:13] said, "Fritz, you've been like a
[1:15:15] companion to me. You've cloed me and you
[1:15:18] sent me to school. When you got hold, I
[1:15:22] was going to take care of you. Now
[1:15:24] they've killed you." I said, "I promise
[1:15:26] you, Fritz, that he won't leave. Mr.
[1:15:29] Short won't leave." I said, "I promise
[1:15:32] you he won't leave. I'll catch him on
[1:15:34] the street someday walking then I'll run
[1:15:37] right over him. See, I said I'll get him
[1:15:40] for you. But you know what?
[1:15:44] That was the man speaking.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; That's the part with you that the filio
[1:15:48] love may be speaking there. But agap
[1:15:51] love has not taken over yet.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; But once you receive the Holy Ghost,
[1:15:56] once you realize, oh no, there's more
[1:15:59] something important than than even
[1:16:02] sometime the natural things. and and and
[1:16:04] he went to him and the prophet says,
[1:16:06] "And you know what? I led Mr. Mr. Short
[1:16:10] to Christ and I baptized him in Jesus
[1:16:13] name and I even buried him at his
[1:16:15] death." Yes, sir. I got converted about
[1:16:18] two years after that. I've seen things
[1:16:19] different then. I loved him instead of
[1:16:22] hating him.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. That's the love of God I desire
[1:16:26] in my heart. Not revenge, not anything.
[1:16:30] Not no not no not no not no not no not
[1:16:30] no not no not no not no not no not no no
[1:16:31] no no not no no no no not no no no not
[1:16:31] no no no not no no no no not no no no
[1:16:31] not no no no not no no no not no no no
[1:16:31] not no no no not not her no not not
[1:16:32] tooth for tooth and foot for what no
[1:16:36] beyond that Lord I I I I forget all the
[1:16:39] past I forget all that let me love that
[1:16:42] person I want him to be saved let me
[1:16:45] bring HIM TO CHRIST AMEN PRAISE BE TO
[1:16:48] GOD
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; and God because even of that I believe
[1:16:50] because even of that God gave him fruit
[1:16:52] on the other side that's the message we
[1:16:55] have received the grace of God I don't
[1:16:58] understand how an animal without The
[1:17:00] soul can be part of the body change. I I
[1:17:03] don't ask me a question, but I just
[1:17:05] believe that it's possible. Amen.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you have a little pet. Oh,
[1:17:09] praise be to God. Your pet might be on
[1:17:11] the other side, too.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; That's the power of the message of the
[1:17:16] hour. If it can do that FOR ANIMAL, HOW
[1:17:18] MUCH MORE for those who are the soul OF
[1:17:20] GOD, THE NATURE OF GOD INSIDE OF THEM,
[1:17:22] YOU CAN PRAY FOR YOUR CHILDREN. AMEN.
[1:17:25] BECAUSE GOD CAN RESTORE YOUR CHILDREN.
[1:17:27] BECAUSE IF GOD CAN GIVE ETERNAL LIFE TO
[1:17:30] A TO A DOG, GOD CAN GIVE ETERNAL LIFE TO
[1:17:32] A HUMAN BEING, YOUR OWN CHILDREN. We are
[1:17:35] under THE ATMOSPHERE OF PERFECT LOVE.
[1:17:38] NOW
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; PROJECT YOUR PERFECT LOVE. PROJECT THE
[1:17:41] LOVE OF GOD.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; THERE IS NOTHING of greater force than
[1:17:44] the love of God.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says. James 5:1
[1:17:53] 19:20. Brethren, if any of you do er
[1:17:55] from the truth and one convert him, let
[1:17:58] him know that he that which converted
[1:18:00] the sinner from the error of his ways
[1:18:02] shall save a soul from death and shall
[1:18:05] hide the multitude of sins. The hide
[1:18:08] here in the the word is means to cover,
[1:18:10] not to expose but to cover. But I
[1:18:12] believe not only to cover it, but God
[1:18:14] will forgive his sins. God will justify
[1:18:17] him as if he has never done it to begin
[1:18:19] with. The love of God in action is
[1:18:22] restoration. is not humiliation. The
[1:18:24] love of God is to restore the other
[1:18:26] person. Even if someone falls, the love
[1:18:28] of God, your desire is to restore him.
[1:18:31] Your desire is to lift him up. Your
[1:18:34] desire is to bring him out. Amen. If God
[1:18:37] love pushed you, God love pushed God,
[1:18:40] constrain God to come down. Amen. I
[1:18:42] believe that God's love in our heart
[1:18:45] help others also to come up. Amen. 1
[1:18:48] Peter 4:3 says, "Love above all things.
[1:18:52] Have fervent charity among yourself, for
[1:18:54] charity shall cover the multitude of
[1:18:57] sins." Amen. Above all means above any
[1:19:01] other things. What is above other
[1:19:03] things, you need to have love of God.
[1:19:05] Now, covering that means covering never
[1:19:08] means it doesn't mean you ignore evil or
[1:19:11] you excuse unrepentance or you pretend
[1:19:14] that sin does not matter or sin does not
[1:19:16] exist. That's false love. Is it okay if
[1:19:19] I go this way a little bit? Sometimes,
[1:19:21] you know, see ah no, no, just cover it.
[1:19:25] That's not what it means. Covering.
[1:19:27] Covering doesn't mean you ignore sins or
[1:19:29] you pretend that sin doesn't exist. But
[1:19:32] covering covering means you you bring
[1:19:35] that person under Christ and Christ will
[1:19:39] cover everything.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. People say because sometimes we
[1:19:44] have a false impression of what real
[1:19:47] love is. Amen.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; People say he's too good. God is too
[1:19:52] good. He's too good to do it. God is so
[1:19:55] good. Prophet says, "I believe that God
[1:19:58] is good." A teenage boy said not long
[1:20:00] ago in our town in presuming the
[1:20:02] prophecy in our city, he said, "You know
[1:20:04] what?" HE SAID, "GOD IS SO GOOD, brother
[1:20:06] Bam." He said, "You know, God is so
[1:20:08] good. He just let me do anything." He
[1:20:11] said, "I don't care. He doesn't care. He
[1:20:13] doesn't mind because God is so good to
[1:20:16] me." Prophecies and nonsense.
[1:20:22] Nonsense. God is good God. We hear so
[1:20:26] much about him being a good God. And I
[1:20:28] believe he's a good God. I said, "That's
[1:20:30] right. He's a good God. But if he's a
[1:20:32] good God, is God to be a just God, too.
[1:20:35] He can't give us a commandment to do
[1:20:37] something another and and and and then
[1:20:39] to do something another and we disobey
[1:20:41] it and expect to escape the judgment.
[1:20:43] He's also a god of wrath, a god of
[1:20:46] judgment. That what makes him a good God
[1:20:48] because he keeps his word. He watches
[1:20:51] over it. Amen. So we can't expect to do
[1:20:53] wrong and these things that we do and
[1:20:55] get by with it. No. No. We just is not
[1:20:59] is not is not so. No, it's good. That's
[1:21:01] true. But I don't want you I don't want
[1:21:03] you to misunderstand me. God is a good
[1:21:05] God. That is exactly right. Remember the
[1:21:08] only way he can be God, he can be good
[1:21:10] is to be just. If he's just, if he's
[1:21:13] just, he has to keep his own
[1:21:15] commandment. If he keep his commandment,
[1:21:18] if if he keeps his commandment, it's
[1:21:20] wrong for Christian tolerate
[1:21:23] with the world or tolerate the world.
[1:21:25] It's wrong. We shouldn't do it. We are
[1:21:27] to be a different person. We are only
[1:21:30] venturing out presuming it without
[1:21:32] actual authority. God's words give us
[1:21:34] the authority that the authority we
[1:21:36] should stand on is what God said. Amen.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Just keep a little balance here. I like
[1:21:43] the way the prophet puts sometimes a
[1:21:44] balance for us. Amen.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Cuz sometimes we can go on one way and
[1:21:48] God is just so good and say now God is
[1:21:51] good but God is also a God who's
[1:21:53] righteous. That's why Moses could come
[1:21:55] and stay in the bridge there because he
[1:21:57] put the word of God to God. God, you
[1:22:00] prom you promised to Abraham that you
[1:22:02] shall give him a seed and you shall give
[1:22:04] them inheritance. So God, you can't
[1:22:06] destroy what you already you already
[1:22:08] promised. That's your word, Lord. And if
[1:22:11] you want a blessing from God, put the
[1:22:13] word of God in front of God. Amen. That
[1:22:15] what Jacob came to God too when he was
[1:22:18] coming when he has to meet Esau. So God,
[1:22:21] I'm desperate, but I know one thing. YOU
[1:22:24] PROMISED ME. YOU BLESSED ME. THAT'S WHY
[1:22:27] I'M COMING AND PUTTING THE WORD OF GOD
[1:22:29] TO YOU, LORD. AND GOD HAD TO HONOR HIS
[1:22:31] OWN WORD. AMEN. CAN YOU IMAGINE A MAN
[1:22:34] fighting and wrestling with God? How can
[1:22:36] you overcome God? How can you wrestle
[1:22:38] with God and and and and win and and
[1:22:42] overcome?
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; IT'S ONLY BY PUTTING HIS OWN WORD
[1:22:46] BECAUSE GOD CANNOT REJECT HIS OWN WORD.
[1:22:50] IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE
[1:22:51] FOR GOD IS TO REJECT HIS OWN WORLD. SO,
[1:22:54] HE HAS TO ACCEPT HIS OWN WORD. AMEN. SO
[1:22:56] DON'T SAY, "NO, I I IGNORE GOD'S word
[1:22:59] and I'm going on my own way." No. THEN
[1:23:02] YOU ARE OUTSIDE OF OF THE COVENANT.
[1:23:04] AMEN. COME INTO THE COVENANT OF THE WORD
[1:23:06] OF GOD AND GOD will honor you. AMEN.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; SOME MINISTER ARE AFRAID TO MENTION
[1:23:11] HELL.
[1:23:13] If you mention hell, you know, YOU ARE
[1:23:14] SCARING PEOPLE. BUT IN THE WORD OF GOD,
[1:23:17] IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW THE WORD OF GOD, YOU
[1:23:19] GO TO HELL.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:25] LOVE OF GOD IS CORRECTIVE. IF YOU
[1:23:26] CORRECT, CORRECTION IS NOT TO DESTROY
[1:23:29] BUT is to it in order to prevent the
[1:23:31] destruction. Amen. Actually, no one go
[1:23:34] God doesn't send anyone to hell. People
[1:23:37] send themselves to hell. As the prophet
[1:23:39] say you you made your you you yourself
[1:23:42] going you are doing the it's hard to go
[1:23:44] to hell. Do you KNOW THAT?
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; IT'S VERY HARD TO GO TO HELL because God
[1:23:48] has PUT ALL THE SAFEGUARD ALONG THE WAY.
[1:23:51] EVERY TIME YOU DO SOMETHING WRONG,
[1:23:53] SOMETHING tells you no that's wrong.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Even an unbelievers, something is inside
[1:23:57] of him telling that's wrong.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; SO IT'S VERY HARD TO GO TO HELL.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; By God's grace.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; But people naturally sometimes what he's
[1:24:08] like a little child don't do this then
[1:24:10] that's the thing he's going to do
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; because that's the flesh. AMEN. BUT
[1:24:13] THANK GOD FOR THE HOLY SPIRIT COMES AND
[1:24:15] HE HAS POWER OVER THOSE THINGS AND GIVE
[1:24:18] YOU THE DESIRE FOR GOD. YOU LOVE GOD
[1:24:20] MORE THAN ANYTHING. YOU WANT TO SERVE
[1:24:22] HIM MORE THAN ANYTHING. LIKE I SAID LAST
[1:24:24] SUNDAY, the love of God inside of you,
[1:24:26] you don't want to hurt him. I don't want
[1:24:29] to hurt you, Lord. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. I
[1:24:32] DON'T WANT TO hurt you. The love of God
[1:24:34] prevails.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; So, we are chosen unto salvation. If you
[1:24:39] are chosen unto salvation, the prophet
[1:24:41] says,
[1:24:44] Israel could not figure out God's love.
[1:24:47] They thought that love meant no
[1:24:49] suffering. They thought that the love
[1:24:50] meant a baby with parental care. But God
[1:24:55] said his love was elective love. The
[1:24:58] proof of his love is election. That no
[1:25:00] matter what happened, his love was
[1:25:02] proven truly by the fact that they were
[1:25:04] chosen onto salvation. How many are
[1:25:07] thankful for predestination
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; for election in our lives? His love was
[1:25:12] proven truly by the fact that they were
[1:25:14] chosen unto salvation because God has
[1:25:17] chosen you to salvation through
[1:25:19] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[1:25:21] of the truth. Oh, I love this one. SO IF
[1:25:25] YOU ARE CHOSEN UNTO SALVATION, God is
[1:25:27] not ignoring sin. Sometimes you rebuke
[1:25:30] sin.
[1:25:32] Sometimes even openly rebuke sin.
[1:25:34] Proverbs 77 27 says, "Open rebuke is
[1:25:38] better than secret love." Faithful are
[1:25:41] the wounds of a friend, but the kisses
[1:25:44] of an enemy are deceitful.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; I thank God when God is rebuking me.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; It means that God loves me.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; I thank God when the word of God is
[1:25:54] correcting me.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; It's God loving me. Amen.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT GOD IS GOD PREVENTING
[1:25:59] DESTRUCTION. IS GOD HELPING ME? I THANK
[1:26:02] GOD WHEN GOD IS REBUKING ME OR THE way I
[1:26:04] dress and the way I dressing is is
[1:26:07] immoral. You have to change your way.
[1:26:09] I'm not saying, you know, God, that's
[1:26:11] hard on me. No, thank God for your love,
[1:26:14] for correcting me.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; I THANK GOD WHEN HE'S REBUKING ME.
[1:26:17] HUSBAND, LOVE YOUR WIVES. OR WIVES, BE
[1:26:20] SUBJECTED TO YOUR HUSBAND. That's not
[1:26:22] that's not being legalist. Is God love?
[1:26:25] Thank God for your love.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you for helping me. Amen. I THANK
[1:26:30] GOD WHEN GOD WHEN GOD IS REBUKING ME IN
[1:26:33] THE WORD OF GOD, I don't want the kisses
[1:26:35] of an enemy. I don't want someone
[1:26:38] compromising on the word of God. If
[1:26:40] someone is compromising on the word of
[1:26:42] God is your enemy.
[1:26:44] Remember that pastor who was telling
[1:26:48] that little lady you know himself was
[1:26:50] smoking outside there.
[1:26:53] It's a little bit a sad story that
[1:26:55] little that little that little girl or
[1:26:57] that little lady brother spoke about
[1:26:59] that little lady. She was even a Sunday
[1:27:01] school teacher and then and she she she
[1:27:04] kept living a immoral life or whatever
[1:27:06] life she was living in and her pastor
[1:27:08] was not rebuking her and she was kept
[1:27:10] going on and then at the at the time of
[1:27:13] death she she's dying she realized oh
[1:27:16] I'm lost I'm lost because I was it was
[1:27:19] supposed to be an angel of God PICKING
[1:27:21] UP HOW COME I'M GOING TO DARKNESS I'M
[1:27:23] LOST CALL THE pastor
[1:27:26] and the pastor is smoking outside
[1:27:30] And I call the pastor. They come in and
[1:27:33] oh no, no, she she's hallucinating.
[1:27:35] She's putting a shock. They're trying to
[1:27:38] calm her down. NO, YOU I DECEIVER.
[1:27:40] YOU'RE A LIAR. YOU KNOW, you you
[1:27:42] deceived me. Now I'm lost.
[1:27:45] Why? Because you was just It's okay for
[1:27:48] you, you know. It's okay for you know,
[1:27:50] just be religious, you know. Church a
[1:27:53] little bit. No, no, no. That's not the
[1:27:55] message of the hour. The message of the
[1:27:57] earth comes to correct us, come to
[1:28:00] change us. The proverb say, you know,
[1:28:02] today you hate me because I'm hard on
[1:28:04] you and you feel like I don't you feel
[1:28:07] like I don't love you and I'm but one
[1:28:09] day you will love me because I've spoken
[1:28:12] to you the TRUE WORD OF GOD WITHOUT
[1:28:14] COMPROMISE IS THE LOVE OF GOD. THE
[1:28:17] CAPSTONE IS LOVE OF GOD. THE WORD OF GOD
[1:28:20] UNVEILED TO US IS THE LOVE OF GOD. IT'S
[1:28:23] NOT LEGALISM. IT'S THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:28:25] THANK GOD FOR CORRECTION.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; It changes our attitude. Amen.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; In anything in the small details, Lord,
[1:28:34] I want correction of the word of God.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ correct his own mother. So,
[1:28:40] don't you know that the word I have to
[1:28:42] be after my father's business.
[1:28:45] Sometimes looks like hard. How can you
[1:28:46] say that? Because the word of God
[1:28:48] corrects the error.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; The love of God corrects the error.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Lord, correct me when I'm wrong. every
[1:28:55] time, ANYTIME
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S YOUR LOVE TOWARDS ME.
[1:29:00] AMEN.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; In the natural how we love our children.
[1:29:05] Sometimes you are so hard towards them
[1:29:07] than someone else child.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's love. Amen.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; You can't touch other people. You wish
[1:29:16] sometimes like
[1:29:23] or you don't want to go in jail and
[1:29:25] everything. So you just leave it gone.
[1:29:27] But you love them. But your own children
[1:29:29] now you are very hard
[1:29:31] because you want the best. The same
[1:29:34] thing spiritually speaking. Amen. The
[1:29:36] natural is a TYPE OF A SPIRITUAL. GOD IS
[1:29:39] GIVING THE WORD OF GOD AS HARD AS can be
[1:29:41] but it's still God's love.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:47] That's why on the other side they called
[1:29:49] my precious brother when they saw
[1:29:51] brother Vana my precious brother. Oh if
[1:29:54] you had not come we would not be here
[1:29:56] because you came because you stay
[1:29:58] FAITHFUL TO THE WORD OF GOD. YOU DID NOT
[1:30:00] COMPROMISE. YOU DIDN'T follow
[1:30:02] popularity. You didn't follow money. YOU
[1:30:04] DIDN'T FOLLOW ALL THESE THINGS. YOU
[1:30:05] STAYED TRUE TO THE WORD OF GOD. THANK
[1:30:07] GOD FOR THE MALACHI FARM. THANK GOD FOR
[1:30:10] THE SPIRIT OF ELIJAH JOHN. THANK GOD FOR
[1:30:12] THE HOLY SPIRIT. AMEN. THANK GOD. I WILL
[1:30:15] SAY EVEN TODAY BEFORE WE GO ON THE OTHER
[1:30:17] SIDE, THANK GOD THAT MALACHI 4 came.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; IF HE HAD NOT COME, WE WOULD NOT BE
[1:30:22] HERE. IF YOU NOT COME, I WOULDN'T KNOW
[1:30:24] YOU. WILL YOU KNOW ME? BUT THANK GOD FOR
[1:30:26] THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR THAT BROUGHT US
[1:30:28] TOGETHER WITHOUT COMPROMISE. I THANK GOD
[1:30:31] FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. AMEN.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE NOT COME, we will not be here.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; And he said, and I want to say, but
[1:30:39] where I WANT TO SEE THE LORD Jesus
[1:30:40] Christ. No, you can't see him yet
[1:30:43] because he's on the is higher dimension,
[1:30:45] higher level. Says, but one day he will
[1:30:48] come and he will judge you. So he will
[1:30:51] judge me. Will he judge Paul? Say yeah,
[1:30:53] he will judge Paul too.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. The brother says, "Oh, PRAISE BE
[1:30:58] TO GOD. IF HE JUDGES PAUL AND HIS PEOPLE
[1:31:00] PASS, MY PEOPLE, IF YOU JUDGE ME AND ME
[1:31:03] AND MY PEOPLE WILL PASS THROUGH." WHY?
[1:31:06] BECAUSE I PREACHED LIKE PAUL PREACHED. I
[1:31:08] STAYED FAITHFUL TO THE WORD OF GOD. I
[1:31:11] DID NOT COMPROMISE ON THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:31:13] THANK GOD FOR THAT. AMEN.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; I CAN AND THE PEOPLE RESPONDED. WE ARE
[1:31:18] RESTING UPON IT.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; TODAY WE ARE SAYING THE SAME THING. WE
[1:31:22] ARE RESTING UPON THE WORD OF GOD. WE ARE
[1:31:25] NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE WORD OF GOD FOR
[1:31:26] NOTHING. WE STAY TRUE TO THE WORD OF GOD
[1:31:29] BECAUSE IT'S the love of God being
[1:31:31] expressed.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Not for condemnation,
[1:31:37] but for the rapture.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; False love will try to compromise on the
[1:31:44] word of God under the pretext of
[1:31:47] avoiding conflict under the pretext of
[1:31:50] not hurting people's feeling. Oh, you
[1:31:53] hurt my feeling.
[1:31:58] remember the experience of that pastor's
[1:32:00] wife. So she came like she's makeup and
[1:32:06] tight things and she she came she's
[1:32:09] playing the piano and
[1:32:13] looked at say that's your wife say she's
[1:32:16] my wife she's a scent
[1:32:22] she looks like Hint.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Hint.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; A hint. A ant true.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Not making a little but it it is it has
[1:32:35] a truth behind it
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; because he could correct the error.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; So that's love towards that person. If
[1:32:43] you just want to batter them, then you
[1:32:45] are not doing them a good service.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Oh God, help us to preach the whole word
[1:32:50] of God.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. because that's the true love of
[1:32:53] God. Let the head of home stay with the
[1:32:55] word of God because that's the true
[1:32:58] correction. That the love of God. Let
[1:33:00] the mother stay with the word of God
[1:33:02] BECAUSE THAT'S THE LOVE OF GOD.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Charity is the bond of maturity of the
[1:33:12] church.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; We need a prophet of the age to define
[1:33:16] to us what is charity? What is the love
[1:33:18] of God? Because without it we might be
[1:33:21] mistaken with the wrong attitude of
[1:33:23] filio and calling it the higher level of
[1:33:27] agapa love.
[1:33:30] But even in fil the parents don't
[1:33:32] overlook over sins a good parent because
[1:33:36] overlooking everything means there is no
[1:33:39] correction. But the bible says in
[1:33:41] Hebrews 12 9:10 are you with me this
[1:33:44] morning?
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Furthermore, we have we have had
[1:33:47] fathers of our flesh which corrected us
[1:33:50] and we gave them reverence. Shall we not
[1:33:52] rather be in subjection unto the father
[1:33:54] of spirit and live? For they verily for
[1:33:57] a few days chestned us after their own
[1:34:00] pleasure. For he for a profit that we
[1:34:03] might be partakers of his holiness. And
[1:34:05] verse six says, for whom the Lord loveth
[1:34:08] is chastened
[1:34:09] and scorgeth every son whom he
[1:34:12] receiveth. If you're Jew chesting, God
[1:34:15] dealeth with you as with sons. For what
[1:34:19] son is he whom the father chasteth not?
[1:34:22] One time I preached a message, it's a
[1:34:24] grace when God deals with you as a son.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; It's God's grace.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Because if he deals you with a servant,
[1:34:32] he might leave you. If he deals you not
[1:34:34] as a son, it means he might let you do
[1:34:37] whatever you want to do.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; But when he deals you have a son, he's
[1:34:41] hard on you. That's right.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; How many times it has happened to me
[1:34:45] many times. I see other people crossing
[1:34:48] and no flashing of the light but the
[1:34:51] moment I fly.
[1:34:55] Oh why is hard on me? I told you many
[1:34:59] times I think I've told us you were
[1:35:01] there as as a student as I was a student
[1:35:03] people can cheat but the moment I try to
[1:35:06] cheat
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; they caught me.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; WHY? WHY?
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR TREATING ME AS A SON
[1:35:15] BECAUSE HE DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO do
[1:35:16] anything. He's watching over you. He's
[1:35:18] after you. HE'S CORRECTING YOU. THANK
[1:35:21] GOD FOR GOD'S GRACE WHEN HE'S DEALING
[1:35:23] WITH ME AS A SON. HE CORRECT ME, SPANK
[1:35:27] ME SOMETIMES. AND THANK GOD FOR THAT
[1:35:29] BECAUSE IT'S YOUR LOVE. I APPRECIATE
[1:35:32] GOD'S LOVE IN MY LIFE.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; But to realize that it takes maturity.
[1:35:39] Amen.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; That's why charity is the bond of
[1:35:43] perfection.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Matthew 18:15 says, "Moreover, if your
[1:35:53] brother shall trespass against thee, go
[1:35:56] and tell him his fault between thee and
[1:35:58] him alone, and he shall hear thee that
[1:36:00] shall gain thy brother." That's a good
[1:36:03] example why charity deals with a sin
[1:36:05] privately, not publicly. Charity does
[1:36:08] not expose the mistakes of others. You
[1:36:10] try to restore your brother or your
[1:36:12] sister. You retain it with love to
[1:36:14] prevent sin from spreading and
[1:36:16] destroying more lives. Like can ach
[1:36:28] your sister to be saved. You don't want
[1:36:30] to affect everybody else. Amen. Jesus
[1:36:32] Christ being the perfect example. He
[1:36:34] addresses it in the case of the woman
[1:36:36] taken in adultery. Say John 8:1011 said,
[1:36:39] "Neither do I condemn it. Go and sin no
[1:36:41] more." The Lord Jesus Christ covered her
[1:36:44] with the public covered her from the
[1:36:46] public shame. But he refused to deny the
[1:36:49] sin. He refused. He refused to say that
[1:36:51] she did not make a mistake. You made a
[1:36:53] mistake. But go and sin no more.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; So that's the attitude. Amen. You
[1:36:58] forgive and we have to forgive. But you
[1:37:00] know what? What you did is wrong. Don't
[1:37:02] do that anymore. Thank God for God's
[1:37:04] grace in our life.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; And the Paul Paul said in 1 Timothy 5:1
[1:37:10] 19:21 against an elder receive not an
[1:37:13] accusation but before two or three
[1:37:14] witness them that sin rebuke before all
[1:37:18] that others also may fear. I charge thee
[1:37:21] before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:37:23] the elect angels that they should
[1:37:24] observe these things without preferring
[1:37:27] one before another doing nothing but
[1:37:29] partiality.
[1:37:31] Love of God does not do by things by
[1:37:34] partiality
[1:37:35] partiality. You know this because this
[1:37:38] is my son, this is my kids. You know
[1:37:40] what? You just let them pass. This is my
[1:37:44] wife, I let them pass. Or this is my
[1:37:46] husband, I let them pass. No, three
[1:37:49] things without partiality.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; But was hard on upon his own children
[1:37:53] was hard upon the wife, upon himself.
[1:37:56] Because the word of God is the absolute.
[1:38:00] No pastor is above the word of God. No
[1:38:03] office is above the WORD OF GOD. NO ONE
[1:38:05] IS ABOVE THE WORD OF GOD. ABOVE ALL
[1:38:07] THINGS IS THE WORD OF GOD. AMEN.
[1:38:10] EVERYONE IS SUBJECT TO THE word of God.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; But there's a principle here that is
[1:38:14] also saying says no charity cover
[1:38:16] things. It's not about catching someone
[1:38:19] struggling. But charity also correct the
[1:38:22] error. Sometimes
[1:38:25] it has to correct the error publicly
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; but still God's love. Amen.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; So for the elders,
[1:38:33] for the heads of home, for the for the
[1:38:37] officers of the church,
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; you are an example. You are influencing
[1:38:42] many things. What you do is it influence
[1:38:44] many things.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you need to be corrected
[1:38:48] publicly.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Are we mature church? Amen.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; And as a small church, sometimes you
[1:38:53] correct things everybody knows who you
[1:38:55] are talking about. Mhm.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; And some people even turn their head to
[1:39:01] see we're talking.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; But as a mature Christian, you know,
[1:39:05] it's not about humiliating one person,
[1:39:07] the other one.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; It's still God's love.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; We want that person to be saved
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; and we won't protect any other person
[1:39:15] from that influence. Amen.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; I hope may God help us. Amen.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; And sometimes I'm sitting there, the
[1:39:21] word of God is correcting me too.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. And I repent God. Thank God for
[1:39:26] correct me. You send brother Victor
[1:39:28] brother say did this. Oh God thank I see
[1:39:30] that. Oh I didn't see that angle but
[1:39:32] thank God the word of God is above
[1:39:34] anything. Or brother Gilbert who
[1:39:36] sometimes myself even I'm talking oh God
[1:39:38] this is the word of God. Thank God for
[1:39:39] correcting. I didn't see that when I was
[1:39:41] preparing but now I'm preaching it. I
[1:39:43] see the word of God speaking to me. I
[1:39:44] also humble to it. Lord thank God
[1:39:46] FORGIVE ME LORD. AMEN.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; THE WORD OF GOD IS CORRECTING US.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39:56] But I like here says against an elder
[1:39:59] receive not an accusation before but but
[1:40:01] before two or three witnesses them that
[1:40:04] sin rebuke before all that others also
[1:40:07] may fear.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Leaders shape doctrines and behavior
[1:40:15] and sometimes think you know the offices
[1:40:17] of the church you have you are an
[1:40:19] example. People look at you because your
[1:40:22] attitude is influencing others. Amen.
[1:40:25] You can't be a leader and you are always
[1:40:27] the one late influencing a lot of people
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; without knowing it. Myself included. God
[1:40:34] help me.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; So I have a post. Let me be there on
[1:40:38] time. Let me prepare. Let because it's
[1:40:42] affecting many people.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:51] Honestly, I didn't want to say that when
[1:40:52] I was preparing the message, but I feel
[1:40:54] like I had to say it.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Leaders shape doctrine behavior. If
[1:41:01] their sin is ignored, others will
[1:41:03] stumble. Silence towards it will become
[1:41:06] endorsement. But people see it. Look at
[1:41:09] that. How how can he be there and it's
[1:41:11] coming late like this? It's affecting
[1:41:13] everybody.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Becomes a spirit. It takes the church
[1:41:16] and go there. Love will come with a
[1:41:19] correction. Love don't tolerate sin. It
[1:41:22] has to correct it.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; I used to wonder Paul said in Galatians
[1:41:27] 1:6, "Brethren, if a man be overtaken
[1:41:29] with a fault. He which are spiritual,
[1:41:31] restore such a one in the spirit of
[1:41:33] meekness, considering thyself, thou
[1:41:35] shalt be tempted." But the same at the
[1:41:37] same time the same Paul who's saying to
[1:41:40] speak to people with spirit of meekness
[1:41:42] and considering that you can be tempted
[1:41:44] by the same time Paul why is not
[1:41:47] respecting the the the why is he not
[1:41:49] respect I used to wonder myself why he's
[1:41:51] not respecting Matthew 18:15 when he's
[1:41:54] talking to Peter said when Peter was
[1:41:57] come to enter I withtood him to the face
[1:42:00] because he was to be blamed and before
[1:42:03] that certain came from James and he did
[1:42:06] eat with the Gentiles, but when they
[1:42:08] were come, he withdrew and separated
[1:42:09] himself, fearing them that were with of
[1:42:12] the circumcision. And the other Jews
[1:42:16] dissembled likewise with him, in so much
[1:42:18] that Barnabas was also carried away with
[1:42:21] their dissimulation. When I saw that
[1:42:23] they walked up not upright according to
[1:42:25] the truth of the gospel, I said unto
[1:42:27] Peter before them all, if being a Jew,
[1:42:30] listen, leave us after the man of
[1:42:32] Gentiles and not as the Jews, why
[1:42:34] compare thou the Gentiles to leave as to
[1:42:37] do the Jews.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; I used to wonder why Paul is not talking
[1:42:41] calling Peter and said, Peter, you know
[1:42:42] what? What they're doing is wrong. You
[1:42:43] know, they need to correct him.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; They said, no, this is a spirit that has
[1:42:48] already influenced so many people.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; He's an elder. is a is is is is a is an
[1:42:54] example to many things. Now you have to
[1:42:56] rebuke it publicly. So you know what
[1:42:58] Peter you're doing it's wrong because
[1:43:01] what you are doing is wrong. You see how
[1:43:02] how many people start doing the same
[1:43:04] thing. Maybe you are not aware of it but
[1:43:06] you're affecting so many people. So
[1:43:08] others also also there say oh that
[1:43:11] actually wrong. Yes that's wrong. It's
[1:43:14] not an endorsement.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Let the WORD OF GOD CORRECT US.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:43:20] AMEN.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Because he was to blame. Others were
[1:43:26] being led astray. Silence will destroy
[1:43:29] more souls.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine a pastor see so many
[1:43:32] things? I know I don't want to say
[1:43:33] because they leave the church. So just
[1:43:36] keep them. Oh, we we need them. We need
[1:43:39] them. Just keep them coming. Just just
[1:43:42] just pick on the nice thing they like.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; We can't make the rapture with that.
[1:43:48] That's right.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; SPEAK THE WHOLE WORD OF GOD WHETHER IT
[1:43:52] REBUKES ME, WHETHER IT CORRECTS ME,
[1:43:54] WHERE I LOVE THE WORD OF GOD BECAUSE I
[1:43:57] WANT TO BE PART OF THE RAPTURE.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; LORD, LET MY INFLUENCE BE POSITIVE. LET
[1:44:02] ME BE PART OF THOSE WHO BRING SOMEONE
[1:44:04] COME CLOSER TO YOU, LORD. I DON'T WANT
[1:44:07] MY LIFE TO BRING SOMEONE AWAY FROM YOU,
[1:44:09] BUT I WANT THEM TO COME CLOSER TO YOU,
[1:44:11] LORD.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; BRING THE LOVE OF GOD IN MY HEART, LORD.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; IF WE DON'T SEE THAT, IF WE WE OVERLOOK
[1:44:20] OVER THINGS, I will say SIN WILL BECOME
[1:44:23] NORMALIZED.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; REPENTANCE WILL DISAPPEAR IN OUR CHURCH.
[1:44:28] WELLNESS WILL CREEP IN. IF WE JUST SEE
[1:44:30] THINGS AND WE JUST SAY IT'S OKAY, LEAVE
[1:44:32] THEM. NO. LET THE WORD OF GOD, LET THE
[1:44:34] LOVE OF GOD COME WITH HUMILITY, WITH
[1:44:38] SIMPLICITY, WE BUT STILL THE LOVE OF GOD
[1:44:40] TO CORRECT OUR LIVES.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; That's why it will be even important to
[1:44:51] read Colossians that we read at the
[1:44:52] beginning. It was the love of God. But
[1:44:55] it says so many good things in the
[1:44:56] natural life to correct people. Amen.
[1:45:00] Love of God. Charity sufferth long.
[1:45:03] Charity is kind. Charity env. Charity
[1:45:06] vth not itself. It's not puffed up. Does
[1:45:10] not behave itself unseemingly. It
[1:45:12] seeketh not our own. is not easily
[1:45:14] provoked, think no evil. Amen. Rejoice
[1:45:18] not iniquity but rejoice in the truth.
[1:45:22] Charity can there cannot be there and
[1:45:23] say it's okay LEAVE INIQUITY. NO, THE
[1:45:26] LOVE OF GOD CANNOT TOLERATE INIQUITY.
[1:45:29] The love of God will WE WE WILL REJOICE
[1:45:32] IN THE TRUTH will rebuke iniquity. Amen.
[1:45:35] Cherth bear of all things, believe on
[1:45:37] all things, hope of all things, endure
[1:45:39] of all things. Charity never fails. But
[1:45:41] whether there be prophecy, they shall
[1:45:43] fail. Whether there be tongue, they
[1:45:44] shall cease. Whether there be knowledge,
[1:45:46] it shall vanish away. BUT WE KNOW IN
[1:45:49] PART, BUT WE PROPHESY IN PART. BUT THEM
[1:45:51] WHICH is perfect is come, that which is
[1:45:53] in part shall be done away. WE THANK GOD
[1:45:56] FOR THE PERFECTION OF THE LOVE OF GOD IN
[1:45:58] OUR TIME. THANK GOD FOR THE MESSAGE OF
[1:46:00] the hour. Amen.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; What the prophet says from ALL THE GIFT
[1:46:04] IF YOU want a church with many gift the
[1:46:07] the Pentecostal HAVE SO MANY GIFT SO
[1:46:10] MANY GIFT IN THEIR CHURCHES AMEN AND we
[1:46:12] want those gift don't take me wrong we
[1:46:14] want those gift but there is no perfect
[1:46:16] love of God there
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; to correct the error
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; that's why they still there and people
[1:46:22] are prophesying they're still in in
[1:46:24] wearing trousers and things are catching
[1:46:26] THEIR HAIR PUTTING MAKEUP AND ALL
[1:46:29] DIFFERENT THINGS and the men ARE DOING
[1:46:30] THEIR LIFE AND HAVE TWO THREE WIVES AND
[1:46:35] BUT THEY'RE PROPHESYING THEY have a many
[1:46:36] gift and they have uncuction
[1:46:39] all those THINGS ARE GOOD BUT THANK GOD
[1:46:42] FOR THE WORD OF GOD TO come to CHANGE
[1:46:43] THE HEART
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; CHANGING YOUR HEART PREPARING THE BRIDE
[1:46:47] FOR THE REDEMPTION
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; CORRECT the error
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; says I'm going to do all these things
[1:47:00] for you. I'll give you that. But I won't
[1:47:02] let you have any of these things. Says,
[1:47:04] "Let me have real love in my heart."
[1:47:06] I'll say, "God, give me love." But where
[1:47:09] there is love, it will endure forever.
[1:47:11] That's what drove the heart of God to
[1:47:13] send Christ to the earth. Mercy said,
[1:47:15] "God, we approach God through the
[1:47:17] channel of love and faith. Faith take us
[1:47:20] to the channel, but the love of God is
[1:47:22] the one that takes us in the channel
[1:47:25] without the love of God." It says the
[1:47:28] the um love love is the most powerful
[1:47:31] force that stops anything there is is
[1:47:34] love. Love that moved a mighty God. GOD
[1:47:37] SO LOVED THE WORLD THAT HE GAVE his only
[1:47:39] begotten son. Love is the great keynote
[1:47:42] thing we live out. It's something that
[1:47:44] eternal. Let me say it. The love of God
[1:47:47] brought God down.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; As it was at the place where he was, the
[1:47:54] love of God brought him down.
[1:47:56] at
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; the level where we are. But if you allow
[1:47:59] me to allow the love of God is taking us
[1:48:02] from where we were to also bring us up
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; to God.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; The first coming it was coming down. The
[1:48:11] second coming the love of God is
[1:48:13] bringing us in the rapture to God. Amen.
[1:48:16] And it will do the work of correction,
[1:48:17] the work of cleaning, the work of of of
[1:48:20] of realizing our go our salvation does
[1:48:23] not depend on our works but on the of
[1:48:25] the grace OF GOD. ALL THE WORK IT WILL
[1:48:28] DO BUT IN ORDER TO BRING us up to God
[1:48:30] himself.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; When love comes when the two ominants
[1:48:34] meet together then something shall
[1:48:36] happen.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the love of God in our
[1:48:39] lives.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; It says oh love reaching out. When his
[1:48:43] own children cried out for his blood, he
[1:48:45] screamed, "Father, forgive them." They
[1:48:48] don't even know what they are doing.
[1:48:49] That's love. The church don't want that.
[1:48:52] They want creed. But we need love. The
[1:48:55] church is dying by creed. It's only live
[1:48:57] by it's only it can only live by love
[1:49:00] because love is eternal life. Love
[1:49:03] overcomes all things. Love is the most
[1:49:06] powerful force there is. They didn't
[1:49:08] want him because they know what was in
[1:49:11] the gift. Amen. You see, I like the way
[1:49:14] he's putting it. They they want creeds.
[1:49:16] They don't want love. You might say,
[1:49:17] "Why can you compare creed and love?"
[1:49:20] Yes. They don't want they want the
[1:49:22] creed. They don't want the word of God.
[1:49:25] But we want the word of God
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; because it produce the love of God.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; And it's also the love of God. The
[1:49:31] church is dying by creeds, but can only
[1:49:33] live by the love of God. There's another
[1:49:36] subject I could take but with the
[1:49:37] prophet how he was saying you know
[1:49:39] almost the evidence evidence of the Holy
[1:49:41] Spirit was love but we give that another
[1:49:44] time. So you never cast a devil out by
[1:49:46] the wrong attitude. It takes love to do
[1:49:49] that. Love is the most powerful force
[1:49:51] there is in the world. Now if you notice
[1:49:53] a devil is always hate. Hate is of the
[1:49:56] devil. But when people hate someone,
[1:49:59] remember it's a terrible devil. Devil to
[1:50:02] despise or to dislike. You must not do
[1:50:05] that. No matter how bit the other is,
[1:50:09] love remains itself. Love is the
[1:50:12] ultimate of grace. Love is God
[1:50:15] ultimately for us. For after all other
[1:50:19] gift and things have vanished, our
[1:50:20] prophecies, our tongues, our
[1:50:22] interpretation, all that I've ever done
[1:50:24] or the more when love comes in, it's the
[1:50:27] ultimate. It above all cause all other
[1:50:31] failures. The Supreme Court decision,
[1:50:33] it's the typost. It's the northstar that
[1:50:36] keeps the the the semen the semen the
[1:50:39] semen level. It's the compass that guide
[1:50:41] us. Love is the ultimate.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many desire more of God love?
[1:50:47] Amen.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Give me a few few minutes here. So be
[1:50:53] wrapping up to thank you for your
[1:50:55] patience. So filio comes from the world
[1:50:57] fellowship. If you feel your love is
[1:50:58] what you have for your wife, a man might
[1:51:01] flirt with her, insult her and you will
[1:51:03] shoot his brain out of it. And that's
[1:51:05] what filio love will do. It accompanies
[1:51:07] jealousies and many other things goes
[1:51:08] with it. But agapa love will make you
[1:51:11] pray for a sinful soul. That difference
[1:51:13] between the two love. God's love is the
[1:51:15] beginning of love. It's the fountain of
[1:51:17] love. The church today is lacking in
[1:51:19] that real agapa love that makes you have
[1:51:22] love for your enemy. If we only had that
[1:51:25] kind of love, there would be a revival
[1:51:27] sweep this nation from coast to coast,
[1:51:30] from north to south. The reason that we
[1:51:32] do do not have that's the main reason
[1:51:35] the church is not progressing like it
[1:51:36] should. We don't need theology. We only
[1:51:39] need the real love to go with the
[1:51:41] theology we already know. WE ALL ARGUE
[1:51:44] SO MUCH whether we should be baptized
[1:51:46] backwards, forwards, whatever. That
[1:51:48] won't make any difference how you are
[1:51:50] baptized or what church you belong to or
[1:51:52] what evidence that you have to that you
[1:51:54] are a Christian. If you haven't got
[1:51:56] love, you haven't got God. We need love.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; As God has described what love of God is
[1:52:02] and we we can't even go you still can't
[1:52:05] describe it in fullness. But the love of
[1:52:08] God can be correction. The love of God
[1:52:10] will be will be the word of God. love of
[1:52:12] God, the Holy Spirit, the all the
[1:52:14] description of the love of God. As the
[1:52:16] bride is understanding more and more of
[1:52:18] that love, she just said, "Lord, I need
[1:52:21] more of that love." Because if I love
[1:52:23] you, one more time, if I love you
[1:52:25] really, if I really love you, I will do
[1:52:27] great things for you. Not as a burden,
[1:52:30] but because I love you, Lord.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; And that's what the church needs.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Not more more knowledge, but more of the
[1:52:37] love. I know the author of the word of
[1:52:39] God. Help me to know you by love. Amen.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; In the power of love of God
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; more than theology.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; Let me take just one time, one po
[1:52:57] portion here. Give me a few minutes.
[1:52:59] Sorry. So I don't have feel like I I
[1:53:02] skipped so many things already. But just
[1:53:04] I wanted to say this. Luke 9 5456. When
[1:53:08] disciples came, disciples James and John
[1:53:11] saw this, they said, "Lord, will thou,
[1:53:14] will thou that we command fire to come
[1:53:16] down from heaven and consume them, even
[1:53:19] as Elias did?" But he turned and rebuked
[1:53:22] them and said, "You know not what man of
[1:53:25] spirit you are of. For the son of man is
[1:53:27] not come to destroy man's life, but to
[1:53:30] save them."
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; And they went to another village.
[1:53:36] Just want to put emphasis here. They did
[1:53:39] not have the love of God yet.
[1:53:43] But
[1:53:44] they took the scripture, they quoted the
[1:53:47] scripture, they saw what a mighty
[1:53:51] prophet did and they want to replicate
[1:53:54] that
[1:53:56] under the dispensation of grace and
[1:53:58] love.
[1:54:00] And they missed the point because they
[1:54:03] saw the works of God. One more time.
[1:54:05] They saw the works of God. They saw what
[1:54:07] God did in Elijah, but they didn't catch
[1:54:10] the way of God. The inner reason behind
[1:54:14] it is love of God.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; So Jesus Christ is coming and correcting
[1:54:18] them. And I said, "No, you know what?
[1:54:21] Even it was done there, it doesn't mean
[1:54:23] that you have to do it all the time.
[1:54:26] Sometimes you can take the word of God
[1:54:28] and you quote it. But if you don't quote
[1:54:31] it without the love of God, sometimes it
[1:54:34] can be doing also some damage. Putting a
[1:54:38] parallel a balance here. God help me to
[1:54:41] have the love of God in my heart even
[1:54:45] when quoting the truth because the truth
[1:54:48] will only have his real potential, his
[1:54:51] real work when it's being worked on the
[1:54:54] love of God. Amen.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; The love of God is the bond of
[1:54:58] perfection.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Every different part of the body are
[1:55:01] good. Can you imagine? You have very
[1:55:03] good home, good eyes and many things can
[1:55:06] be part in the body and are very good.
[1:55:08] But if they don't work together, they
[1:55:11] won't be efficient. The thing that make
[1:55:14] them work together is the love of God.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; That's what we desire in our church.
[1:55:20] God, fill me with your love of God. that
[1:55:23] the part that I'm doing it can edify
[1:55:26] someone else
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; because it's being worked under the love
[1:55:30] of God.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; That's why we desire the love of God.
[1:55:33] Amen. Let's stand together. Thank you.
[1:55:36] Patience
[1:55:43] as the music's playing softly. Read 1
[1:55:46] Timothy 1:46.
[1:55:49] Paul saying neither give heed to fables
[1:55:52] and handless genealogy which minister
[1:55:54] questions but rather than godly edifying
[1:55:59] which is in faith. So do now the end of
[1:56:03] the commandment is charity out of a pure
[1:56:06] heart. The end of the commandment. So as
[1:56:10] a ministry say the end of my ministry

[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; without nothing,
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; without the savior.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; But you descend yourself

[2:10:56] That's a love that no one can do.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; That's a love no one can bring in this
[2:11:04] life.

[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; he become a flesh.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; He came down

[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; He took our life.
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you.

[2:11:40] statures of the perfect man.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; Before come in the point of to have that
[2:11:48] love,
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; we pass by virtues.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; We pass by knowledge. We pass by
[2:11:54] temperance.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; We pass by patience.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; We pass by love.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; And then you come, you dwell in us.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; For having that big love.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; That's why we are this morning here.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; To hear about love.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; To sing about love.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; Dear Lord, we don't want to sing just
[2:12:18] love. We don't want just to talk about
[2:12:21] love.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we want that love to be us.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; That everyone in this church to manifest
[2:12:28] that love.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; Because you died for that love. Lord
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; forgive our sins. Lord
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; dear Lord
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; give us the Holy Ghost.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; Yes Lord.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; Because is that Holy Ghost will give us
[2:12:41] the
[2:12:43] the true love
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; in our life.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; It will not be a fellow love.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; But it will be a a gap love. Yes Lord.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; And we need a aapola in the end time.
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; Because this world become a bad word.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; A bad word that we we see people are
[2:13:04] living uh such a a bad life.
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; But if we can have uh a gap love,
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; we can bring someone to Christ.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; Just for loving him, he can come to
[2:13:18] Christ.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, father. Because we read brother
[2:13:22] Abraham say the sign that can show that
[2:13:26] someone is saved is when he can go and
[2:13:30] uh bring someone else to the word.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; But we can't bring some someone to the
[2:13:36] word if we don't have love.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; That's why we need that love. Oh Lord
[2:13:41] Jesus Christ.

[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; May you accept to give him more
[2:14:00] revelation
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; to guide this church
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; in the truth and
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; yes
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; and in the love of God.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. Because sometime we are like his

[2:14:17] way. But if he can have the love and if
[2:14:21] you can give him the revelation to bring

[2:14:41] Jesus
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; because oh Lord Jesus Christ, we are in
[2:14:46] the end time
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; and we are seeing what is happening in
[2:14:49] this world.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, give us the way that we can
