We appreciate each presence of each and every one of you friends, old friends. God bless you richly and the regular God bless you richly. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. hard to mention any name all the names but we are one body amen in Christ Jesus Christ that what matters the most and thank you Lord I will just um I would invite the word of God I'll invite brother brother Steve I think most of you know brother Steve I know brother Steve from from from couple of years and uh I've been to some I've been to the camp family camp I've been to the services that he he preached in the end time message regarding the family and it had been a blessing and I believe we all going to be blessed. Amen. I just want before I invite him, I just want to say one story, a small story. When I was young, when I was young minister, I was a single back then and I had a I had I had a roommate. I just put put you a picture. I had a roommate and I was a preacher and then one time his wife was back home and he called and he and he told to the wife and he was he was speaking to that in mother tongue. I couldn't understand everything he said. when he end up and I said brother that's not how he talk to the wife it's your love and everything and I was like know I'm I'm a young minister so telling to him he was a good friend of mine and he just saw brother Moses brother Moses I respect you a lot but when you'll be married &gt;&gt; then we can talk and when when I got married as I think of him as oh Brother Marshall. So that's what brother brother Steve is. So he's a he's he's married. He has children. He has a children who went through a teenager. He has a child who got married. Now he has a he's a grandpa. So he he can tell from experience. &gt;&gt; So uh uh maybe if I I'd say some advices here, some of them I say, "No, we wait for your children to be teenagers. We'll see uh how many remember on end time message I pre I preached one message on how to keep the kids in order in the church young kids and I didn't have any child there I spoke so hard and one brother of mine a friend of mine well later on when I had kids and said how how are you keeping the kids in the church so okay now I I preach by experience if I preach the same message by experience I will have a little bit of humility but when We are hearing today from God speaking to us but also someone who has experienced. So we come to learn you know the Holy Ghost is a gift but a character is something you have to work on. So we are here to learn God maybe our character mold us help us shape us. There are things we have to arrange. Help us Lord Jesus Christ to become better father, better husband, better wife, better mother, whatever God wants us to be. Are you willing to God? &gt;&gt; And I desire more of you. &gt;&gt; That's what we put it a little bit as a team as a challenges that we face, but don't only look at the challenges. Babam says the word of God, the anti- message will meet every conditions, every challenge. So we are here to learn from God so we can meet those challenges. Amen. And so we invite the word of God. Brother Steve, God bless you richly higher higher ground. You know that song just to let sing the chorus and give him time. [Music] I'm pray I'm pressing on the upward way. New hearts I'm king and in every day still praying high as I'm more than Lord plant my feet on higher ground Lord lift me Lord lift Yeah. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] [Music] Heat.

Lord Jesus, it's such a privilege to be in your house tonight, to be gather in your presence, Lord. And even though Lord we all came and we are all appreciate Lord to be able to see each other Lord first and foremost Lord we came to hear from you. And so Lord for that Lord we need to put oursel aside and &gt;&gt; allow you to come here and have preeminence Lord &gt;&gt; and I pray Lord even though some people doesn't know me and I don't know them Lord we have something in common &gt;&gt; we come from the same place &gt;&gt; and we are on the same journey &gt;&gt; and we have the same calling &gt;&gt; and so Lord may be we united together in your presence by faith Lord and may you come down maint and have preeminence and take control over every spirit so that you may be glorified and speak to our hearts tonight and simplicity. I pray Lord in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord bless you tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's really good to see every one of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so um it's my first time here and it's my first time to meet most of you. So I had the privilege to uh to meet uh the now I would say former pastor. I understand there's been a transition and so I wanted to pay my respect to my elder to my brother for your ministry and also for the support. So I bring you greetings from brother Andre Pet some of you know him. He's my father-in-law and so I bring greetings from from him and his wife. And also I want to thanks this church for the support you've been given to brother Andre and the mission field and so we are really uh grateful grateful for that and I want to uh congratulate the church and for a orderly transition changing a pastor is a huge challenge it is a huge challenge I've been uh there's been a transition between me my father-in-law 17 years ago uh this November unfortunately Certainly it was not an orderly transition because my father-in-law had a health issue and so it came upon the church suddenly and his his health was not doing fine and uh he felt in his heart that Lord was asking to move in in the mission field but it was it was it was sudden even though I was assist I was I was the assistant pastor since two weeks and two weeks after I was voted as the assistant pastor we thought me andre will work we we were already working together, but to work in that new capacity and we didn't have a chance because right away two weeks after he called me and his health was not doing good and the church was a bit in a turmoil and so when the pastor is not doing good and the church is already going through something then it became much worse and so I became the pastor in the middle of that and it it was a it was a difficult it was a long transition not to blame anyone but when a church can go through that process in in orderly way. I I I I cherish to to see that and I want to I want to to to say to the church it is a blessing. It doesn't make it easy. It doesn't make it easy. It's a change. Every man is different. That's why the prophet says, you know, they cannot be two heads in the church because every man will do it a certain way. And and me and my father-in-law had different different um totally different character. We love each other, but we're not built the same way. And so the church had got to use to me and and some it was difficult for them to get used to me. Well, he's not like brother Andre. Yes, I'm sorry for that. I even though I would try, I have to be my be myself. And so we we need the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Church, a church to stand together, it needs it needs it needs God. It needs God. uh uh in in every place in the world they try to keep things together. It's they they try to keep a hockey team together. They try to keep have motivation and keep people together and they try every tricks in the book and it it's sometime a lot of time it doesn't work. &gt;&gt; They have to change a coach. They have to change a spirit. They have to change things all the time because there's no unity. So the miracle is when a group of people that are from different horizon and different makeup that we could walk together and accept the differences. You know sometimes the people want church to be like I don't know a a communist system where everybody's the same, everybody thinks the same. No, we should we should you know you know that there's the unity of faith and then there's the unity of spirit. The Paul says we should thrive for the unity of spirit until we reach the unity of faith. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And unity of faith the prophet says he says when we going to see Jesus eye to eye then when we going to be with Jesus then he says we going to have unity of faith then we're going to see eye to eye. Until then to see eye to eye the prophet says he says I disagree even with my own wife. But but sometime people thought that unity of spirit was to everybody would see eye to eye exactly the same way every comma. I'm sorry to disappoint you. I don't think that's possible until we have a body change. There's things that there there's going to be you know there's those great theme that we agree but then when we going to fall into the small details there's there's differences. That's why that's why Paul taught to to to to to everybody to go after their own conscience. &gt;&gt; The Bible teaches that Romans, you know, and and and so because what we have a different conscience for for somebody this this seems okay and this other brother is like, "Oh my goodness, like I don't like this brother is doing this and and everybody wants the other people to be like them." &gt;&gt; And it caused many division. It caused many you it stirs the church and it's it's not it's not good. So, may the Lord bless you &gt;&gt; and and and and you all look good tonight. And so, I'm really happy to be with you. I'm happy, brother Moses, uh, for the fellowship. Um, he obviously he has interest in Quebec. His brother is there. His his brother is assistant pastor in a church in in Montreal, not too far away from home. So, he came visiting us and preach at our church. And I met him in Edmonton. And so, brother um when he texted me and he said that he wanted me to come by and he was a pastor uh I was like what? Okay. And then I told him I says I don't know if I should congratulate you or wish you my condolences. I I I I didn't know what to say. You know it is a blessing but being pastor is a is a huge is a huge challenge. It's not only a personal challenge. It's a p it's a it's a it's a challenge in your marriage. It's a challenge for your family. Um you can be seated. I feel like I I'm breaking the ice here. Sorry for for keeping you standing. Um I'm off note. I'm off script right now. I just feel on my heart to maybe talk a little bit about pastoring. When when my wife um realized that I was about to become the next pastor, she would cry. She was crying. And I was shocked because I looked at her. I was like, "Why are you crying, honey? I mean, this is this is God's calling. This is this is precious, you know." But I didn't realize she's a pastor's daughter, so she knew what she was getting into. I didn't know. So, we had to sit down and have our conversation together. And she explained to me what she went through as a kid when the the father became a pastor. She felt like a vacuum swallowed daddy &gt;&gt; and she felt like we lost daddy when he be because my father-in-law became the pastor when the church was splitting because the other pastor left the message with half of the church. So there that was not an orderly transition. So our church has been there. So the first pastor was there 17 years. Then the second one's been 17 years. I'm in my 17 years. And some of them I'm wondering Lord what's coming. But I see there's a change right now in our church. Might not be a change of pastor, but something something is changing. Church, you've been there for years. God is still challenging the church. challenge the church to be better and to enter more in our uh in our calling. And so I had to sat down and and listen instead of just saying, "Well, if you cry, it's a lack of faith and you should just shake out of it." I didn't do that. I sat down and listened to her heart and understood it was not a lack of wanting to serve God is that she she just knew what was the price. And then we made a covenant together. I had to make a covenant with her that I would I would by the grace of God not forget the family. But at first in my mind that's not what I had in my mind as a pastor because I was like Lord you know I have uh many children but if you call me to as a pastor then you ask me to to to take uh care of your people then you Lord you'll have to take care of my children while I take care of your people. And no, I see your reaction now. The Lord didn't want to do that deal with me. And he reminded me of Moses. Moses, you know, was leading the people of God. But his own son, &gt;&gt; his own son was not circumcised. He would preach that every Sunday. You need to be circumcised and we need to apply the token or whatever he was preaching. But at home, but he had a wife. She helped him good that day when the angel came. The angel didn't give him a pass because well, since you're taking care of my people, I'll give you a pass on your family. And so for me, these were the first lessons as God is calling me pastoring was my my wife's reaction and and then my uh my conception of what my life would be. Then God right away told me this this is this won't be it. If I'm asking you to be a pastor, I'm asking you more. And then then I realized, okay, this is serious. This is there's no pass. And so it's a it's a it's a it's a blessing. It's a great calling. Some people think sometime that is glamorous. You know, you have a title, people respect you, but sometime they don't. But you know, you get both. You know, you get both. And and uh Quebec is a different culture. I I know here maybe Edmonton is conservative and and and back in the US they they have their this appreciation day for pastor like it's almost like a national thing you know appreciation day for pastors that's a we don't know known such thing in Quebec in Quebec the background is Catholic so people are rough with the church people are rough not talking about church people but but there's there's a stigma with with pastor because it it reminds them of priests and priests have caused a lot of doubt damage in Quebec. And so there is there is that stigma when you say you're a pastor. People are like, "Ah, is it like a priest?" I'm like, "Yeah, but I have kids and I'm married." Oh, that's good. That's good. [Laughter] So, may the Lord bless this church in this transition. &gt;&gt; Be patient. &gt;&gt; Be patient. It's not because things have been done physically, vote and this and that. it doesn't mean that it's it's completed. &gt;&gt; So be patient. Be patient with what's one another. Be patient with the new pastor. And and and just walk slowly as the Lord is completing the transition in the spiritual realm. &gt;&gt; One pastor told me that was pastor many years before me. He says, "Brother Steve, I don't want to discourage you, but he says, he says, I felt it took me seven years to really feel like I was fully the pastor." And then I went realized a couple of years later, I went in the Bible and it took seven years for David, you know, that he was first pastor of Judah for seven years until the rest of Israel was like they were watching him. you know the house of Saul and and and the rest of the tribes they were watching David from far like can we trust him? Will it be like Saul? Will it be like this? Will it be not saying the old pastor was Saul? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. But just just the difference, you know, and and then the rest and it took he was a king. He was king seven years and then God dealt with the heart of the rest of the Israel. And so we don't run into into these things. We cannot rush. We cannot push other like well you should accept the new pastor. You should you push. We don't push these things. God is in control. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We believe God started this church &gt;&gt; and what he started he will finish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So this was not premidated. It's off script but I just felt in my heart just to encourage you. &gt;&gt; We've been we've been through those transition and just felt in my heart to encourage you. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We will stand tonight. read a a portion of the scriptures in the book of Ephesians 5 28-33 and um and then after that uh honestly I don't know how much I'm going to preach and I'm much I'm going to share with my own heart uh what the burden I have for families the burden I have for &gt;&gt; for marriage and you'll I I'll give you a little bit of my background after we read the scriptures maybe you'll got get um some understanding. Ephesians 5 28-33. So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth even as the Lord the church. For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they shall two, and they too shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church. Nevertheless, let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself, and the wife see as she as she reverence her husband. May the Lord have the blessing upon the reading of the word. You can be seated. So as uh brother Moses in his is his his introduction I'm used to call him. Okay. Amen. I'm telling my Congalles friends, I'm guessing some of them are Congalles, that I'll be in Congo. So, I was speaking French. So, Lord willing, I'll be in Congo next month. I've been wanting to go. I had on my heart to go since over 10 years. And the Lord never opened the door, but I knew I know in my heart that I needed to go. And finally, the Lord made a way. And so we will be in Congo next uh next month. So as our brother introduced me talking about my family. So yes, we we have a a tribe. Um it's uh the Bison. And so my um my oldest son is married and got married a year ago and now they have a baby. They didn't wait for a long time. They were I guess they were ready and so now I'm a grandpa. So that's a new season of life. So there's a brother elder in my church says, "Brother Steve, we should expect some grandpa sermon soon." You know, the the the ministry of the grandpa. And so yes, maybe that's going to come, but it's all new to me. I need I need to learn. So you have brother Andre and sister Suzanne. So we just celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary uh last month. And so it was last May, but to get all the kids spread across America, their children to be together, it had to be in September. So, so yes, our our children is from 16 to uh 23. All of them are are um all of them are serving the Lord. And um but it's it's been a challenge. And I would say that tonight it's it's going to be partially, you know, obviously I'm preaching the word of God, but it comes it comes from also from from experience and and I was raised in the message. So when in 1979 my my my mother gave her life to the Lord. I was two years old. I was raised in a church and at 17 I back. So at seven actually uh my my father left for Greece. So so I'm half Greek or I'm my father's Greek, my mother is French Canadian and he left for Greece and I never saw him until I was 22 and I got married. he kind of show up and and so I was raised without a father and I always thought that it's not a big deal but I was raised with no sibling just with my mother she's working try to make a living no father and so it was it was a pretty lonely lonely childhood and raised in an environment that was not always positive and and as you grow up so at 17 I I I can't my my mom left you know usually teenagers go through rough time and they run away but this time my mother went through a difficult time and she ran away. She left the house and she went to live with a man and I ended up at 16 years old alone living on my own. Tried to do your own laundry and all that. And I didn't realize it was when you go through that you just cope. You just cope. But it's when my son turned 16, I realized I looked at my son when he turned 16. I'm like this is when my mom left. My goodness. That that's That's a crime. I mean that's &gt;&gt; this this is serious &gt;&gt; start to dawn on me that okay something I was raised but like there iso big holes in my life and you think it doesn't affect you &gt;&gt; or you think that your new birth will fix the holes as a you know the new birth will fix you spiritually you know but there is there is things in in the background that we tend to repeat because We we learned certain things. We I grew up without a father. So when I started having children, I was asking my wife, "So what did your dad do when this happened? What did you I was looking for a model. Did Jesus say, "I do what I see the father doing?" But when you're raised in a fatherless home, you are clueless because you're never if Jesus was doing what the father was showing him. If if Jesus as he walked on earth had words from the father saying this is my beloved son. I never had that moment of affirmation where a father declare his son. But but but God is showing that as a model of fatherhood. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you don't have those moment, you don't make a big deal out of it because you don't know what you don't know. &gt;&gt; You know, if you have a father that that that really, you know, you know, abuse you physically, you know that he hurt you. You know that he was bad. But fatherless home is an invisible pain, is an invisible scar. You don't know that you're damaged because it's invisible. It took me many many years to see that I was crippled in a certain in my humanity. Now I was a servant of God. I had many experience with God, supernatural experience with God. Caught in the ministry, married a wonderful daughter of God. But in my fatherhood, I I was as a human being, I was crippled in many areas of my life and I didn't know it until I start to raise those precious treasure and I started to repeat some of the patterns. Then I realized there's something wrong with my fatherhood. But then I didn't know better. And so that was a long process to for me to go and and find healing and find answers for myself to become the father I never had, which is is a great challenge. So for me, that's where family and and marriage became a burden because I knew how crippled and how much the first three we we laugh sometime now. We can laugh about it, but the first three kids, especially the first two, they I started I I really started on a bad I would say on a bad way of approaching and dealing with them. And and I could see in their eyes that I didn't have it. I was causing distress in them. I was causing more. They had something I would I would make it worse. I try to keep it straight, but I was too strict. And and I would I would overwhelm them with my my discipline. And I I I I didn't know how to do it. I love the Lord. I could preach. Boy, I could preach. &gt;&gt; You know, you may be a great preacher. That's okay. &gt;&gt; But it doesn't make you a great father. &gt;&gt; You can know the message and you can read and have some experience with God. I mean, Moses is a great example for that. How he could lead millions of people, but not taking care of his home &gt;&gt; until God had to send an angel. say you got it all wrong and so it is a great burden and and and some maybe some of you heard me preach on these so back home I don't preach on these theme all the time I preach you know we have a prophetic message there's there's there's you know there's the open word there there's so many things that we were blessed but there's that theme so and when when a pastor called me and I and I preach on family in many places around the world I just come back from India we did a family series had a great great impact I did in New Zealand it had a great impact back. So when I go out, most of the time it's because a pastor is like, "Brother Steve, we have a family camp. We want you to come." So it has kind of become something that I do, especially when I go out because of of the background I had. And because maybe because my background is so broken, it made me study that more and it's been a help around the world. And so maybe some people think, well, that's all he preached. That's all we hear. Because when I go out, that's what I do back home. It's not just what we deal upon. The word is uh the word is there's so many things. It's not just family. But where I come from and where I was raised, it those topic was totally overlooked. &gt;&gt; Totally overlooked. God sent a prophet. This is the end time. Rapture is at hand. Just a prophetic view. It was just a prophetic view. But the pastoral view of strong families make strong church &gt;&gt; was totally over totally overlooked. So we were raised in a clueless environment about how to raise kids, how to build strong families. We God sent a prophet, you know, we believe these things. But because they went so much on a prophetic side, they forgot the pastoral side. So this is my background. So if I make some comments, so I don't know you, I don't know. So it it's not because of what I think about you, but what I'm going to preach tonight is or if I'm critical, it's it's it's because of the background that I come from. So my prayer tonight, this this this can be a a help. &gt;&gt; Um now I want to start with with a quote. Now obviously sometime I such a bunch of rules. I I I might go I think I got a little problem with the rem. Okay. Okay, let's go to rules quickly because I'm going to teach tonight can be something that can be misused. Okay, so the principle and teaching and we're going to learn through these meetings going to be tonight, tomorrow morning and tomorrow night. Tomorrow night so we it's tonight is a slow start. We need to break the ice. You need to understand where I come from. Why do I preach? I I talk like I talk. But one thing for sure is that we cannot use this to attack to blame our parents or members of our family. So this as we expose those things obviously we going to expose things that we're lacking. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; And to be honest even though I learned so many principles I still have to go back and sit with my children as adults now. My oldest is 23 my second is 22 the other one is 28. I sit with them and if they go through something I realize okay that pattern what you're doing right now this is because of me or this is because of your mother the way we the way we approach this with you made you call and so we we have an open discussion and we are we are aware of our failure as parents so we every parents if you think you had it perfectly you might need to revise we did our best so it's it's nothing about to blame anyone but it's to bring a a greater understanding so we cannot also use this teaching to blame or attack the pastor or local church. Well, if only the pastor. Well, if only the church. If if only someone. We're not here to blame. We're here to learn. And if something we need to we're here to heal in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; All right. So, this teaching is meant to help you in your personal walk and not to point fingers. All right. So, do do we have an agreement? &gt;&gt; Really important because I'm I'm I'm I'm giving information. I'm giving advice and in principles that can be used as a weapon to attack somebody else to blame somebody. So it needs to be taken in the right spirit and also you don't go home try to fix your parents or try to fix your family if you're children or try to fix your church. uh it's for you personally when I preach that to I did preach these same things to youth camps for children to understand for the kids to understand that they need to react in a better way even though the family sometime they struggle they have a role to try not to fix it but their attitude because the Bible says Paul says in the book of Corinthians it's not for the children to lay for the parents &gt;&gt; we cannot place the burden to embed the family to the kids and sometime you know when when that's a big mistake parents do if if they if if the marriage is fighting then the mother start confiding in the daughter well you're that your father is like this and and he's doing this and then she puts all unload all the burden the problem marriage to the children don't ever do that because the children now is going to try to do something to fix it and it's a it's a it's such a burden that they cannot bear it'll damage them they need to be children become before they become the wife especially if there's the that their dad is not the husband there's it's it's their dad okay so I to I get was ahead of myself so the children are not to lay up for the parents but it's the parents that need to carry the burden to lay for the children also you cannot use the teaching to justify your wrong habits and behavior oh now I understand why I'm this ambador or why I'm delinquent it's because it's because you you'll find that the prophet lays reasons why there's neurotics and gangsters and street. There's many quotes and in many place those quotes been overlooked. We're going to study them tonight and tomorrow. It's all laying there. The prophet is point the finger, point the cause and effect. If those gangster neurotic turns in the street, why why are they like that? So, we can now blame, well, okay, now I know why I'm a gangster. Well, we cannot use that as an excuse because God has a way out. If you're a gangster, if you're neurotic, if you're if you're a hidden delinquent, God will find you. And God wants to take you out of that pattern because God God have called Christians out of every bad situation, off the streets, off the New York gang, gangsters, and whatever. God God can. So we have no excuse to remain in in in in if we're stuck in a rut somewhere we have no excuse to stay there. But there is explanation though. There is the prophet brought those things. All right. So we have a contract together. &gt;&gt; All right. You all signed up. That's all good. I will start with a quote, a simple one and it will give you maybe uh a better understanding of the mistake where I come from. Again, I will always put it where I come from. But I've traveled many places and I realized there was a pattern in in our ranks in the message. There was a pattern that I could see many many places. Seems like it's been uh uh the same mistake. And that mistake we find in that quote. So the prophet says not long ago we were going together across the country and he said to me talking about brother Fendler he says brother Brandham you know my wife don't believe in this. So she didn't believe the message and said every night when I go to church and come home oh she just start balling me out when I hit the door. And I said I get her I get her by the hand. She's little and hold her and I try to to cast that devil as hard as I can. And it remind me of your message this morning, sir. Said, I tried to cast that devil out. I says, "Devil, you come out of my wife. Devil, you come out of my wife. Honey, you're possessed with the devil. Come out of there, devil." Well, I said, "That's fine, Brother Fendler, but you go at it the wrong way." Now, I got a question for you. Did that brother believe the message? &gt;&gt; Obviously, he did. &gt;&gt; So, he believed the message. He he and he's trying to apply what he would say. He's trying to apply the word to his marriage. &gt;&gt; We hear that many time. Well, I applied a word and she left. Oh, praise the Lord, brother. You You've been faithful. Well, we should ask the next question. How did you handle it? &gt;&gt; Right? So, sometimes the thought of like if you believe the message, you believe everything the prophet said, your marriage going to turn right. It depends. Did you get it? Because this brother and also he's taking inspiration from the prayer lines because he says, "I've watched you on the pulpit how you deal with demons." And he he he tried to bring that and apply it at home the same way. Now, I'm wondering how many time can you squeeze your wife, hold your hands, and squeeze her tight and and and cast the devil out. I'm I'm wondering how much can you do that until you run you literally run your wife away from the house and once she leaves you say well she's serpent seed and I'm glad that this example is there because and and and I think it's like an exaggeration. I I I I didn't see that a lot, but I know that a lot of people when they came to the Lord and the spouse was kind of late and not coming, they made they made s they they poison the atmosphere of the house because the other one was not serving the Lord. Instead of bringing the love in the house, &gt;&gt; they brought war. It's not always the the unbeliever who brought war. In this case, you know, he didn't react well. She she was not happy. Imagine she if if the wife this wife think my husband is in a cult. &gt;&gt; Okay. He was not. But she thought obviously she probably thought so. &gt;&gt; Now when he start doing this it kind of confirms to her. Yeah. That's what I thought. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So the prophet had to correct him and give him marital advice. That's right. &gt;&gt; And he told he says, "You go at it a wrong way." &gt;&gt; So he said, he says, "When you come home, buy her a box of candy." Well, someone said, "Well, that's just a bunch of psychology." Prophet says, &gt;&gt; "Go it the wrong way." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Give it to her. When you come in at the door, put your arms around her and say, "That's the way you cast out devil." Love cast out fear. So actually she was afraid because her husband is in a church and is this and that and she's afraid and now he's afraid that she's going to be lost. And so fear clash with fear &gt;&gt; and the devil has a party while they destroy each other. &gt;&gt; So ones has to show love, real love. And love is redemp love is to bring love is redemptive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. like we we preach about redemption and and Ruth and Boaz all great themes spiritual theme but it can be applied in the home naturally that's what's great is those those big prophetic things that we learn if we scale it down we can enjoy the blessing when we apply those principle in the natural realm it's not just principle spiritual principle so friends the world is dying for love that's one of the great blessing that we leave out of Pentecostal blessing too of it is love that mixth together. The mortar that makes gift and all the things of God operate perfectly is love one for the other. And this is all this will all men know that you're my disciples. So the prophet took the concept the brother had of c casting demons out of your wife and exchange that for a box of candy and telling your wife I love you. Now some of us try to sometime we would like to say okay well I'll try that but then when the box of chocolate is thrown against the wall then we're like well it didn't work because sometime we want quick result. &gt;&gt; We we use love as a money exchange. Okay then I'll I'll I'll try the candy and I and I'll try love. No, you don't have love. You don't try love. You are love. Love is not a currency. Love is a person. &gt;&gt; You know we have the pyramid there. The charity at the top is not an emo. That love is not an emotion. It's not a feeling. That love at the top there. It's Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Christ I came down. &gt;&gt; We our first scripture we read is husband love your wife as you love yourself. Are we good? &gt;&gt; Okay. Now I want to explain another principle is that and this is really um peculiar not peculiar uh this is really related to our movement. So in our ranks, in our movement, we have we have received a prophet. We have received such a prophetic gift and and and and it even though the prophet after the seals, he says, don't change anything. Don't go out and become weird, you know, stay humble and plant your potatoes. Don't change anything. Yes, this great revelation, but you know what? My my I think we've changed a lot of things. And we change sometime also how church operates and now we see the exaggeration now because everything became prophet prophetic prophet as and then the pastor's office the pastoral role has changed in the side the people because the prophetic ministry is so big that prophet a pastor had to to try to navigate and exercise their ministry in a shadow of a such a great prophet that the role of the pastor or the the qualities or the attributes of a pastoral heart has been forgotten by the people. That's right. And and it seems like even the pastor a lot of places has lost their authority and and and when they speak now they need quotes all the time because his burden and what he has on his heart is not enough. It needs to be back up backed up by the prophetic side. Now I want you to I want to show something to you here and maybe it can it can help you understand what I'm trying to say. So in the book of Romans, Paul justifies by faith. He justify Abraham by faith. You you know those things. I so I'll go quickly. But James, when James talks, he justify Abraham by works. For many years, people thought the Bible contradict himself until the prophet came and gave the explanation. But it seems that those two minister contradicts it themsself obviously. Yeah. Therefore being justified by faith or justified by works it seems like a contradiction. But then the prophet comes and says you know the two men that were talking on faith Paul justify Abraham by what God saw &gt;&gt; in Abraham but James justify Abraham by what men saw. And so actually the prophet says it's the angle the point of view that are different. &gt;&gt; But when you look at the nature of those two men's Paul was an apostle but Paul was also a prophet but James was a pastor. &gt;&gt; And those two anointing are totally totally different. The the anointing of an evangelist and a prophet it's the eagle anointing is totally different than the pastor's anointing which is an ox. And sometime pastors are blamed for not being spiritual enough too too earthly, too grounded and and but exact. It's it's exactly and it brought to such a misunderstanding through all those years like James contradicts Paul's who we think he is. He was not contradicting. It's because since he's the ox, he has four feet on the ground and what he saw is what Abraham did. But the prophet could see Paul, it could see that when he did in his heart, it was a done deal. &gt;&gt; But the pastor is watching &gt;&gt; because he's earthly. &gt;&gt; He has no wings. &gt;&gt; So the prophet even says he's a &gt;&gt; burdenbearer. That's right. &gt;&gt; So, and prophet talks about you know evangelist comes to town and everybody's like oh wow we were so blessed last lately we had an evangelist coming and and brother said well I could hear that every week like oh it was so we were so blessed like well thank you I feel good you know and and and but happen so so those flying eagle they could be the evangelist or prophet put such a shadow in and and our movement is be it has become extreme in a sense that Now so many people they want to hear a tape. They don't want to hear the pastor. Or if they allow the pastor to preach, he has to quote all the time. He's not allowed to be a pastor. He has to be a prophet reading quotes. &gt;&gt; And and so there's different level, but it has all the same thing in common. the backfire of God sending a prophet as people as has cornered and tied the pro the pastors in a corner where he has not he has not liberty anymore to exercise his ministry on a pastoral level. That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Neville preached a message at Brennham Tabernacle. And you know what what it was? The prophet says, "Brother Neville preached a great evangelistic message and he and he and he and he and he preached a sermon on kids and malnutrition a pastor and he's preaching in his church on how kids eat too much and eat bad food." I'm wondering how many pastor message would be would be allowed to do that. There's a portion there's a natural element of the pastor's office that has been and I've watched it has been despised for many year which as and I remember even my father-in-law in my own church he would preach off the Bible and and simple things try to apply simple principle and people in church called him a Baptist pastor and despite surprises pastor's heart because he says you're not message enough saying you're not prophet enough. So this this attitude is a is a misunderstanding to the level of brother Fendler's misunderstanding. There's a lot of misunderstanding that it caused problem or big holes in our church where we were not allowed to apply simple principle Bible principle about family raising children making marriage stronger because it was it was called and labeled psychology and I remember many years ago when I started preach those things people were accusing me brother Steve you're trying to do the job as a psychologist I says You got it reverse. &gt;&gt; Says before psychologist came around, who was doing that kind of job? &gt;&gt; As the pastor was in charge of the flock, he was taking care of the people. &gt;&gt; But because the church has let down and and and now people are going for life coach and for advice and they're getting a bunch of nonsense out there, but people are seeking guidance for their soul. &gt;&gt; And I understand that the first guidance of the soul is to be filled with the Holy Ghost. I get that. But God also has sent pastors to help you with natural things where we should be allowed to teach teach simple principles. Yes, there's this huge prophetic the prophetic view is like the view of 13 13 thou 30,000 ft. You see the old age you see before the foundation of the world. Bless your heart. It is such a blessing and we need to preach those things. It's and it's been covered abundantly I'm sure. Mhm. &gt;&gt; But then when we we make a close up with the same principle, we can talk about Boaz and Ruth and scale it down and bring it right in our house. &gt;&gt; And we need to be able to go up there and down there. But when we go too down there, I know because because I covered those topic out of a necessity necessity for me, my own family, my own five kids, my own background, my own troubled childhood sitting in a mess church, message church. When I was young, there's been a scandal in the church where men started to abuse little children, young my friends. And some of one one of them confided in me and I'm the one who talked to my mom and finally we exposed the thing. He was cast away and and all that. But we were clueless that those kids were heavily damaged. They had a whole we we were clueless that something needed to be done. Now that you got rid of this monster, &gt;&gt; we thought the rest was okay. &gt;&gt; My own family, my own friend left and he never came back. And when when I gave my heart to the Lord, he he says he says, "I don't understand why my my my friend would return to a place where they abuse children because that's all he had in mind because it did not get resolved in his heart. And it's not because nobody cared because people were not careless. They were just clueless. &gt;&gt; So what I'm talking about is real life issues. It's real things that cannot it's been overlooked for too long. &gt;&gt; And it's not a lack of care. It's a misunderstanding of God's will for his church. We have forgot the pastoral ministry. But the prophet says even James is a pastor. And what is he talking about? He says if if if if you tell the needy, you know, I'll pray for you. He says &gt;&gt; depart in peace and warm and still and you don't give him nothing. like my father-in-law sometime he was blamed like blame in Haiti because he was printing books opening churches but also sending money to orphanage and feeding the poor and some accus him well is your work a mission work or humanit like your red cross like you could just go spiritual but if you go natural you're off the word and I understand the prophet says that's money is not you don't build hospital because now the exaggeration is denomination became all about just hospital and just the natural and they lost spiritual side. But sometime we swing on one side, then we sing totally on the other side and we're supposed to left the orphan star because oh we we're going to give him a tape or we're going to give him a message book. But the Bible says if you don't give him anything. So why James is talking like that? Because he is a pastor. &gt;&gt; He sees the needs in the people. &gt;&gt; Now obviously the pastor is going to preach a prophetic. Absolutely. We have such a great message, but there's there's the natural element that needs also to be covered. And so it's like a young man comes and he talks to the pastor and he says, "You know, brother, I want to get married." He talks to the pastor and I have this sister in a church I'm interested into and Lord showed me and I I listen to a tape every day and I pray and I fast and Lord showed me. And a pastor's like, "Well," and and and this young brother thinks he's going to impress the pastor because like he's so spiritual. The pastor's like, "Okay, do you have a job?" &gt;&gt; No. No. But God showed me and and he wants to go spiritual. You want to go up there, but the pastor keeps him down there like, "Do you have a car?" &gt;&gt; And then the brother's all offended. My sp my pastor is not spiritual. He he didn't see the spiritual vision that I have. Like you might be up. you I don't question your spiritual vision but now it needs to be manifest on this on this earth &gt;&gt; we need to land this vision on earth &gt;&gt; all right so probably for the sick he he maybe it reminds him of some of the experience he had giving counsel sometime to people that are so Lord God show me God show me I get it but what I see is your wife is crying And so the prophet says that the pastor is a burden bearer. &gt;&gt; He's the ox of the team. And what amazes me with that quote is that he says he's a man that can sit down. And that quote when he describes the pastor, he doesn't he doesn't even mention how much he preach. Obviously, we know that he preaches, but that quote, he says he sits down with families. &gt;&gt; He's a man that could sit down when somebody's got something against somebody else and he sit down with them two families and take it and reason it out. &gt;&gt; Reason. &gt;&gt; He's using reasoning &gt;&gt; and bring it back into sweetness. He's a pastor and he knows how to take care of these things. You put an evangelist between two families. &gt;&gt; Well, he's going to apply the word, &gt;&gt; but the pastor is built for that. &gt;&gt; So, he's the ox on the team. He's the ox. He's built for that. He sit with people. He sit with I spend more time with people than sometime the numbers of hour in the week that I spend behind the pulpit versus the number of hours I spend talking to people. I talk more with people than I stand behind the pulpit &gt;&gt; because there's a real need. And and when the prophet was asking to people for interviews, he says, "How many want an interview?" &gt;&gt; Now the modern word for interview today is counseling. We call it counseling. The message word for counseling is interviews. &gt;&gt; Okay? So call it counseling, call it interviews. Is the same thing. You're sitting in an office with a man of God. that try to apply the word and try to give you godly advice with what you're going through. And so the prophet said at one point he says well who don't want one because he how many wants like all the hands raised like who doesn't want one then you think well obviously everyone want to sit with the prophet but then the prophet says no every one of those needs are genuine needs and he says some of these things cannot be dealt behind the pulpit &gt;&gt; so there's always so also that idea that I've heard in our ranks that every problem should be solved by the preaching of the word the preaching of the world word cast most of the spirits out and the preaching of the word ca solves a lot of problem but not all of them the prophets you can go find out I was not I didn't I didn't know I would dwell so much on that but I just follow the leaning of the lord but the prophet says he says some of those issues these about life and he says they only can be dealt in the office but he says I have too much prophet says I have and then other people will say well only the prophet could do that well again you got it wrong a lot of misunderstanding. So first of all, if there is a place that every if if there is a place on earth at one time that your problem could be solved by the preaching of the word behind the pulpit was at the Brham tabernacle sitting under brother Brham in human flesh and then he said some of those interviews could only those situation could only be fixed behind doors where we can have an open discussion. So the preaching of the word behind the pulpit doesn't sol the prophet says he said it doesn't solve every situation &gt;&gt; and then this idea that only the prophet could do it since he passed away now only the preaching can solve the prophet when at the end of his ministry he says I'm he says I cannot do interviews anymore but he says there is ministers sitting here he says that can help and then he names minister that are sitting here he says go see those brother they believe the message and there's as qualified as me to do it. Obviously, we know the prophet had vision. You would know before you enter the office. He had the answer. I wish I had that sometime. For many years, I thought I wish I had that. But again, sometime gifts in the church can help for that. But but so the prophet is pointing at men of God in the church and he says, "They're going to help me." And Moses reached that point sometime in his life where the burden was too much for him because he spent so many hours sitting with people trying to help them. God didn't say, "Well, quit counseling. Those people are stubborn." No. God said, "Now find 70 people &gt;&gt; because there is needs in the body of Christ." Right. &gt;&gt; And so as you see tonight before we start addressing the families and marriage, I'm addressing the misunderstandings. And those misunderstanding, I found them everywhere I go. Even though I don't know you, I found them in India. I find them in New Zealand. I found them across. There is if you want to understand those, you listen to question and answers. Especially one in 64. The four message in 64 almost all those questions became a false doctrine later. Even though he answered black and white, &gt;&gt; it became later on something that people kept believing. It's kind of unique. It seems it shows that spirits don't die. Now, another misunderstanding is that because you're born again and you're a new creature and believe that that God's will to will totally ignore your natural side. And there's a quote here where the prophet would give an advice to someone based on its nature. Not just saying, well, you're new. You're the word of God said this and and like we don't care. I apply the word. So, um, I'm going to read you this quote and then you're going to see how the prophet would would approach those things. He says, "I found someone, excuse me, in the interview this morning." So, it's in interviews or counseling that I realized that a person uh had a question about a genuine person, a real person. They live right and they've heard me say the evidence of the Holy Ghost wasn't speaking in tongue and is and it it isn't. But I advise that person to ask God to let them either speak in tongue or prophesy because it's the nature. The first thing I went to that person and found their birthplace and what sign that they were born under and I could tell what their birth was and which way is set in their natural nature sets them in a certain line. &gt;&gt; Then when they're reborn again they're over here in that other nature. And when you find into this nature that's in conscious inside conscience but the outside conscious moves you in a one way. That's your natural birth. And then they'll make up something and and it puts them what? Under four. And it puts them in a split condition. They don't know what to do. They'll say, "The Lord wants me to do this." So the prophet realized that if you're born a certain way, you lean a certain way, but then your new birth make you lean in another way. And I'm not talking mean leaning on a sinful way. Just leaning in a certain way the way your makeup is. And so for that person, she was probably somebody and I don't know, but the prophet would go as far as your birthplace under what sign &gt;&gt; to try to determine who are you and what's your nature. Then he could understand that's why you have a question like this and then he would give an advice. I'm wondering how many pastor could stand up and say well I I advised that person to pray the speaking tongue. Well, the prophet condemned the thing. He gave an advice that looked contrary to his teaching. Why? Because he could discern the nature and the need of that person. And he says, "My advice for her is to let he said ask the Lord to let you do it because you're built a certain way." So maybe that person is a practical person, whatever she needed. The prophet when he did interviews is is is like in a pastoral role and he have a tailor made counsel to that person to help them with their to harmonize their nature and that spiritual birth and the natural side of it. And the prophet could do those things because he said it's been one of the mo most amazing thing that I have noticed along the lines of my ministry for the Lord Jesus is the peculiarity of people and the study of human life is one of the greatest things that a person can study to watch nature of people. So the prophet was not only interested in supernatural and spiritual thing but he says one of the greatest study you can have is also to study human nature or human life so you can understand how people are different and they're built different way &gt;&gt; and so when you sit with them you understand where they come from what kind of background &gt;&gt; that's why before I started tonight I gave you my background now you know why I take those things at heart &gt;&gt; because my background is I'm a a and a kid that was abandoned by his father, raised alone and many other things I'm skipping. But we were built a certain way and for many years I wondered Lord why why my father abandoned you? Why I was raised like why I couldn't have like a normal family like my wife? My wife was raised with mother sister Suzanne you know five kids and godly home. I was raised in a godly home. It says my mother was a Christian. And by the way, my mother after she backslid, I left one year later and I spent four years in the world. When I came back, I was 21 years old. When I came back to the Lord, I was on fire. And one year after I started preaching, I was 22 in 1999. And my mom never missed one sermon. She was she was in the world, but every time I preached, she showed up in church until I I brought her back to the Lord. And now she's in our church and serving God and being happy. But we we went to through some some tough time. And I was I was I was I was feeling like a victim for many years until God showed me. He says, "Do you see where when you preach on those things who comes to see you after the service?" I remember South Africa. I preach Johannesburg and I I touch a little bit on those things. And after there was a thousand people, there's a big family camp. And after the service, who do you guess who was coming see me after the service? It was those fatherless. those sons fireless that came to me says, "Brother Steve, you're the first man of God I hear talk about these things. I don't feel alone anymore." And I was in India the other day and I had orphans sitting there because where I preached, brother Samuel Kotraad uh it used to be an orphanage. So there's many orphans sitting there and as I sharing my testimony and and and their life is changing and they come to see me after you're touching there's many people sitting in churches with different horizon who are not coming from the same mold. And so that's why God is is asking and he's talking to shepherds. Shepherds are pasture. And he says, "Thus said the Lord, woe to be shepherds that do not feed them that do feed themselves. As should not the shepherds feed the flock. Ye eat the fat and ye clothe with the wool. Ye kill them or that are fed, but ye feed not the flock." Then feed we know feed. We we preach the word. I fed the word of the hour. It's awesome. But verse four says, "The disease have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up which was broken, neither have ye brought up again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought which was lost, but with force and cruelty have you ruled them." And so God is frustrated with shepherd that that that that we're doing half of their their feeding or not feeding or not taking care. So God God is a is is a God who and and I told I told I remember not long after I became the pastor I sat with the deacon board and I said brother I said I said you need to understand you deacons and me sheeps are more important than the pastor and the deacons because we were sent towards the sheep sometime we just view the authority of but the authority of is to be able to lead. Yes, but God want us to take care &gt;&gt; of the flock. And the same thing for the father. The father is the head. And sometime he's the head means he's the boss. So he decides and he doesn't care. But but but the Bible is clear. We have to love our families as we love oursel. So it's also related to your self-esteem. Do do you take care of your own self? Amen. &gt;&gt; And so when I approached pastoring, that's what I had in my mind. Lord, I'm going to take care of you people. You're going to take care of my family. And right away, God says, "No, no, you got it all wrong." And when I saw the tears in my wife's eyes, saying, "I don't want my children to lose their father." And it says, "Wow." Okay, that that that that got me thinking. Then I realized, okay, we have a we have a challenge here. We have a challenge. And so not to be not to be critical as I said this is how I would say difficult and challenging the mentality the message mentality that I was raised in. It had consequences in my generation. My generation in my church when I was young when we were teenagers we all went in the world. We have the greatest message and then we all left and I don't think we have time tonight because the time is already run so we might enter into this tomorrow morning but we going to we going to study again not based my opinion or based on a psychology book but based on quotes. We're going to study tomorrow morning why does people leave. We're going to study why our teenager leaves. We're going to get it straight. The sometime we're like it it's it's we're like a teenager's runaway and we're like oh my goodness he left. It's like something that it happened overnight. It didn't happen overnight. Before it was transferred into the physical realm, something inside was not going. Not at all. &gt;&gt; Or uh one of the one of the spouse husband or wife files for divorce. It's like, well, I don't get it. It was our wedding anniversary last week and he bought me flowers and then he I received the p lawyers paper this week. It's like it happened suddenly. No, no, no. We're going to study how from the inside something start changing and nobody notice it. And if we don't watch for these things and don't ask the right question, we realize there's trouble in the house when it's almost too late. Not too late on the long term, but too late on the short term. And then we wake up and then we want to and as I as I went, you know, with my and also we're gonna study brother Brandham's reaction maybe, Lord willing, tomorrow night and I I'm not trying to set up something. We're going to see how the Lord leads but because I got so much I could we could preach every night for the rest of keep you one week and I got I've preached so much on that but so I'm trying just to concise and like to do a power pack in three meetings. Okay. But the prophet went through the same thing with Rebecca when she was 18 when she starts slamming doors. Prophet says, "Okay, we got a problem. She's slamming doors and then it it started a chain reaction and there's so much to learn and and I think it's seven seven or eight paragraphs. Prophet told the whole story and every details and how it got solved." So we read the quote, but we we were going to do an indepth analysis of that quote and every steps that brother Brandham took in every change. I used to do this. Now we won't do this anymore. I I thought this way now I get I got to change the way and he changed and he changed and the one who changed the most in the three brother Brandham his wife and Rebecca it's the parents who changed the most and it's in the quote. It is there but it's been overlooked. We read these as little stories, but these are awesome, great lesson. And when we apply those things, we get great benefit. &gt;&gt; But most of the time, it's been overlooked as a little side story because we want the meat of the word. We want the the seals and we want, you know, God and the unveiling of God and who is this MelzDC and and those things are great. And so when he tells a story about Rebecca, we're like, "Oh, yeah. This is a little side note, you know, let's go back to Melzdc." &gt;&gt; Well, because Melzdc wants you to understand that you need how to solve your your your things at home. &gt;&gt; In those principle, I start after three kids. I had to wake up because I was I was having it wrong. Totally wrong. If if if I if how I started my three firsts, if I kept this way, I think all my kids would be in the world right now. I was heading the wrong way. It has nothing to do with their salvation. It has nothing to do with eternal life. But I would have sent them on the wrong path and they would have to learn the hard way and then come back. But there's and so I have five. So I have I have William as a boy and I got four girls. And four girls, they're all different. We think sometime boys and girls and that's all. It's there's two too kind. No, no. Everyone is a kind. And the challenge of being a father and and to follow your kids without being overwhelming controlling, it's being more like overwhelming caring. And there's a difference between controlling and caring. And how does the free moral agency plays into that? &gt;&gt; You're going to see that when brother Brandham had problems with Rebecca when she was two years old and when she was 18, he use a totally different approach. &gt;&gt; Totally different approach because at two, there's no free will. &gt;&gt; At two, you're the one who take control of the spirit. &gt;&gt; At 18, she has a rebellious spirit and slamming door. You cannot really cast that spirit out if she feeds the thing. you have to solve why it does she needs that spirit. &gt;&gt; That's a different question. &gt;&gt; So, because we've we've used a lot of time tonight, I don't know. I don't I lost track of time, so I I don't know where I'm at right now. But but tomorrow, we're going to we're going to we're going to study just the relationship of the relation between it's a chain of effect. It's a series of event that happen. And we're going to go back to the Genesis. We're going to go back to the garden of Eden which we call the season of innocence. And we all had in our life at one point a season of innocence. And that season of innocence, you thought life would be great. There is no pain. Nobody's dangerous. Nobody's evil. Everything is good. I live in a perfect world and my family is perfect. Season of innocence. And the devil wants to come and wreck that in a in the most fear fearful forceful way to traumatize you in a such a way to break you in such a way that you to that that it it you know the prophet says that the devil is allowed a blow in your life. Well, he wants to break that season of innocence to make you somebody bitter and some life would experience sometimes some of you is going to recall painful thing. It might it might be at one point during the the weekend you might you might experience some oh my goodness I forgot about that. But I want you to know there's a place you can run into tonight or tomorrow or this weekend. you can bring those forgotten burdens which the prophet says are laying in the subconscious. That's another thing we'll try to cover just a little bit but it's a whole sermon two ser full sermons if you preach just only on the subconscious prophet talk about that says that's your worst enemy the guy in there that he controls the if he says no it's no you think oh praise the lord I'm going to I'm going to do this when I'm going to get married I'm going to do this when I get married I'm going to do that you get married you do nothing of that why there's somebody inside says no why does he say no because well some somewhere somewhere something happen. And so that's why the prophet says in the greatest battle ever fought, he says you need to clean those channels, the channels of memory, the channels of affection, which is emotion, the seat of imagination, those he says that's why there's so many blow up Christians because they don't clean those channels. So sometime we think because we're Christian, well, it doesn't matter. It's all in the sea of forgetfulness. A lot of people think it's the sea of forgetfulness, but it's not forgotten at all. It's just put on the shelf and when the shelf is full, it cracks. And the prophet says, "This why we have so many blow up Christians because we don't clean the channels." And so when we don't clean the channels, it has a chain of effect until we blow up. And when we blow up, it causes damage to us. If a father blow up, if a mother blow up, the impact is on all the church. When the pastors blow up, there's impact everywhere. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, we need really we need the grace of God. And so, we're going to try to cover a little bit this tomorrow morning and from there we're going to see how how the Lord leads. And so, I realize tonight we stay mostly on on on the on the big bigger picture of what is our belief system that we have developed. And and and we need to we really need we really need the the grace of God to understand that those simple things they're simple principles are allowed to be preached in a church because God cares about those those little things and God cares for these things. Amen. Let's bow our head. for Jesus. It's just Lord just an almost like an opening statement. There is so much Lord to to tackle. Well, I hope Lord that it it gives a little bit of a greater understanding of the misunderstanding. There's been a misunderstanding Lord I feel in many places. I don't know about here Lord but I know many places we really got excited Lord because a prophet came but then we saw Lord and we were seeing the climax of that exaggeration these days where even church and pastors and five-fold ministry everything got true outside the window because they are prophet only but Lord we see there's many levels of that deity spirit that are crippling our church and that are crippling the pastor's ministry where he's not allowed to be a simple pastor who can also teach simple principles. It'll be labeled that he doesn't preach the meat and he's not deep enough and we don't want to hear about family things. And [Music] even the disciples like send the kids away. Don't let the kids bother Jesus. And Jesus is like, "No, you don't get it." What a misunderstanding. What did they had in mind? They thought Jesus not interested in kids. He says, "Let it let those children come. You don't get it. You don't get it, do you? Unless you unless you're like them, you're going to miss it." And the prophet has warned us, don't change anything. Brother Neville was such a simple man. Such a simple man. When the prophet passed away, they got rid of him. I guess he was not deep enough. Preaching on malnutrition. Obviously, they got rid of him. And that happened many places, Lord. They got rid of simple pastor who wanted to lead the flock in simplicity. Cuz all what people wanted to hear is the deep things of God. and to meet and we appreciate those things. Lord, but Lord, I feel in my heart it's time to look and see, have we forgot something? When we see our children walking away, when we see divorce rates in our churches going high, it's the condition of the time. Yes, Lord. But is there something we could have done differently? Have we fed? Have we preached a whole council of God? Lord, you said you came to heal the brokenhearted, the wounded in spirit, but Lord, we don't know what to do with them. We don't know what to tell them. We don't understand human nature. Teach us Lord. Teach us Lord to be able to take care of our wives to to listen. When the prophet went through that season, Rebecca, he said, "We need to think 18 years old thoughts." He realized he was thinking like an adults. Well, I never wanted her to get married. No wonder she's slamming doors. Then he says, "I got to think 18 years old. She need a friend. And when he landed in his own house, he realized he realized his daughter that slamming doors and look like she's rebellious. She needed something and then he saw it. [Music] If Moses went through that, if if brother Brandham in a certain way went through that with Rebecca and Billy Paul, Lord, what about us? Lord, forgive us, Lord. We have overlooked those things sometime. We got caught up, Lord, and and got excited, Lord. And it's all okay, Lord. We're not here to blame tonight. We We want to remember the rules that the opening of the church, this is not a blaming. I told the church, it was really sensitive, but it comes from a it comes from a a heart that doesn't want to blame anyone. I was heading on such a wrong path, Lord. And when I saw the sadness in my son's eyes, when I saw the question mark in my third child looking at me, not understanding why I was so such a bad father. Those kids questions, they had no malice. But I could see in their eyes, they were confused. Why? Why are we afraid of dad? Why am I afraid of dad? And when I saw the fear in their eyes, they were afraid of me. I knew I was wrong. I love the Lord. And I I saw the pillar of fire in my life. I I I had supernatural experience and I was preaching and the Holy Ghost was falling and there was converts and I would pray for people. But when I got home, it was not working. And my I was troubled my heart. Lord, how can it be, Lord, that I am so blessed in your presence, but my children are afraid of me? But you heard my cry, Lord. Lord, I didn't want to repeat the mistake of the other generation. Help us, Lord. We need your grace. We need to be humble, Lord. You've humbled me. So, see if you need to learn everything and you need to unlearn the ways how the Bisson the Bryson how they do it is all bad. They all they got it all wrong. I I used to be proud Lord of how our families raise children. Why did I forgot that I was miserable when I was young? I didn't like it, but I was doing it the same way. Lord, if we walk with you, you're going to show us your way. I pray, Lord, that you inspire this church. You inspire the fathers because it starts with them. They have to set the tone. They have to set the atmosphere in their house. It starts with them. &gt;&gt; Lord, it also starts with the sets of belief that we have. Open our eyes tonight, I pray. in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. May the Lord bless you. I know I know these are not easy things to bring, but it comes from a it comes from a sincere heart, out of a out of a burden, out of a out of a cry. And I just want to say how much I love you and I wish I want the best of I I have the privilege for now of not knowing you which is better now tonight cuz I'm clueless about what this church went through whatever I I have no clue. So it gives me just the freedom just to open my heart. &gt;&gt; But don't take it as an attack or blaming. I am not. I I hope you feel the atmosphere. We I you know one day my son told me he says, "Daddy, I want to be like you." I says, "You don't want to be like you. You want to do better than me. &gt;&gt; I've tried to I've tried to fix the things I've learned from I do what the Lord showed me and and tried to raise the standard higher in the way." But it says, "You take it from there and you do an even better job." Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; That should be if we're not competing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I was talking to our first pastor. [Music] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Brother Steve," he said, he says, "I hear you preach." And he says, "Never in the world I would have bring those things." And he says, "Never I would be able to preach like you." And he had like a complex. And he keep repeating that and it bothered me. I said, "You don't get it, brother." I said I said the reason I'm preaching like that is because in 1970 and 1980s you fought and you open a way when there was no way. There was it was it was all the while you you so you had you had your big chainsaw and you cut the trees and and now we are able to walk and refined it &gt;&gt; because you you did the the heavy lifting. &gt;&gt; Now we can think about think about those things. Amen. &gt;&gt; I told him I said we have where I live, we have, you know, the snowmobile Bombardier BRP. They're built right right in my neighborhood. I said, Bombardier, the guy who invented snowmobile, I said, did you see the snowmobile then? How it looked like and the snowmobile how it looks today? I mean, it's such stronger, faster, more agile. This I mean there we cannot compare. But it says, what do you think? Do you think that Bombardier that the engineer today do you think they're smarter and better engineer than Bombardier was because the machine is built today is so much better? He says, "Oh, no, not at all." And he started bragging about Bombardier. Well, I says, "You are Bombardier." And when I said that, he started crying. Then he got it. He says, "Oh, I get it." Yeah. There was no snowmobile. He made one. It's easy to take this and then bring it to the other level &gt;&gt; and so take it take it as that there's it should be that other ministry God rise up they're going to take the flame or the torch and they're going to bring it higher not because they're better it's because we have the privilege to take it from here instead of take it from there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So there's no thought that this generation is better. We are just we're just taking you know how do you call it the race the relay race. for taking the baton and and we run with it. Hallelujah. May the Lord bless you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Brother Moses, &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's it. A red like me. I once was lost, but now was found, but now I see. was grace that taught my heart to grace my fears. [Music] How precious the thy grace I first believe through angels. [Music] this [Music] rain. His grace has brought [Music] [Music] as the sun. Oh, we know to sing God's praise. And when we first began, praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. to be like Jesus. [Music] Jesus came to be like like Jes [Music] all through life journey Come to glory. [Music] I only to be like him &gt;&gt; to be like Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's my prayer. &gt;&gt; That's my desire. Jesus [Music] all earth I know to be like him all through life journey from earth to glory I [Music] to be like. [Music] &gt;&gt; Is that the desire of your heart &gt;&gt; to be more like Jesus Christ? Amen. Did you like the sermon this evening? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wasn't it just wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank God for that. Thank you, brother Steve. God bless you richly. That exactly what you know, I was just thinking about it. You know we can't um we can't put God in a box you know even in a theme like we said okay we'll be on the theme like that but God took it in a certain angle but we could not expect it will go in that angle but no matter how even it went that angle we still say God thank you thank you you know our needs you know what we have need and u maybe as a pastor of the church. I say okay um was it directed to the pastor only? I don't think so. I think it's for each and every one of us. The mother has a she's a pastor of a certain church. She's a ministry upon our church. It's good mother to you spend spend a lot of time with your children that interview your children because you talk with them the friend that interview it's important bring that to the level of a of a local church in your house. So okay I will I give sometimes I'm give advices I preach I'm an evangelist you have to do this this but certain time no just okay let have an interview is everything fine is everything good same thing for the husband you are a pastor can give too many orders and be an evangelist or be a a prophet but there's a time we have to come down and and create that relationship ship, that friendship with your wife, with your children. Amen. &gt;&gt; Same thing for the pastor. It's not God help me. Not just a pastor here. I'm a pastor. I have a title and everything. People respect me. Pastor, I like that that quote. You are more important than the pastor. God, brother Bam. God was so hard on brother Ban. so hard on brother Bana. Why? Because of because of us. Brother Bana had to suffer a lot because God want the bride to receive the purity of the word without any man ideas. You show how important God cares for us. Same thing. God cares for you more than than myself. And may God help us to have that attitude. Amen. just say I want to be a pastor for my church. I want to be a pastor for my family. I want I want to have that caring bear care bearing of burden burden bearer for my family. Amen. Can can we do that? Can we have a Lord help me to become a better pastor in my church in my family? Help me to become a better pastor in my family. Not only when things I was saying I like the way you put it. Not only when things go wrong &gt;&gt; then you wake up before they get wrong. Spend already the time when things seem okay on the surface. Spend time spend time with your family. Spend time with your family. Very important because a strong church can only have a strong church if you have strong families. We can't we can't we we can't rely on on people who testify today and tomorrow they leave the church. How many people have visited this church? We have seen so many visitors. Do they make this church? No. What makes this church is those few stable people sometimes empty church sometimes. Today we are privileged to have uh many visitors but those those few people on the corner here that's what make the church those pillars there how much more we need to become even better stable families oh god I it just break my heart just break my heart because um I'm a family person too and um a little bit like him I was privileged to be raised in in a family far from my father but um but I was in a good family. Caleb's uh parents were good good thank God good good parents to me they raised me very good very good parents and they brought me to the message very good I'm privileged that I was raised in the right way and they built that confidence in me and loved me and everything but but that relationship as I that I had with them oh I wish I could portray that to my kids wish every family could portray that to the kids uh because that's deep to me. Um what saved me in the message? What what brought me in the message? It was not the mysteries although they're good. I understood um or I the the I I was marveled by it. Oh wow. How wonderful. But deeper than that, it was a family life that I saw like hm can actually people have a family life like this on earth that strike me. So I'm it's deep deeper than me. When you have strong families, it's more than quotes, more than so may God help us to have that life. Amen. Are you with me? Hopefully hopefully I didn't add more than and and we will go to tomorrow. Uh the deacon was just encouraging me to press on on the brother. Can you give him more time? He still have 1 hour. Actually, he still has 1 hour. He still has 1 hour to preach. So I I I I took 1 hour from him um because we could finish at 9:00 today. That was the deacon was trying to negotiate there and I feel like he was led to leave at this time I think. So we allow just the Holy Spirit to go this way. But tomorrow if it's possible um 9:30 we start the songs if it's possible make a so that we give him time that we talk from him today. 9:30 song service start 9:30 song service start tomorrow. I'll try to put that for the local church 9:30. Sometimes put the time that we put we usually put it for the tape to play for 15 minutes and then but tomorrow let's make an exception that make it 9:30 for the song service to start if possible. Can we sing again to be like Jesus Lord make me like you. Make me like you. To be like Jesus. Oh to be like Jesus. to be Jesus on earth.

We just want to be humble with him and accept the way he lead us. But maybe we have taken it in the wrong way.

Father, what we desire to be to do in the right way. How we can be nice to our to our to our wives. We can be nice to our husbands.

Amen. &gt;&gt; He'll give us wisdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why they're preaching like this. It's bringing dust right down to earth &gt;&gt; so that we can learn and have the wisdom how to take care of our families. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That each each one of our children might serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We've got to teach them the right way. &gt;&gt; Yeah. When they're two, yes. Amen. You They have to listen. Amen. You give them directions. But when they're 20, they or 18, they become your friend. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You got to treat them different. Amen. We've been teaching that &gt;&gt; all along. Praise the Lord. Right, Sister Marie? Praise God. So, we're very happy that we're hearing it again. Praise God.

Bless him richly and give him wisdom for tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Give him what we have need of for tomorrow, Lord. Add to what we have heard today. Oh yes, Lord Jesus, we want to be good pastors. We want to care for the sheep. We want to love them and care for them. &gt;&gt; But I pray, Lord Jesus, that you would give us all wisdom. &gt;&gt; How to follow your word. &gt;&gt; Because that's what we want to do. We want to eat of your word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. And so we want to eat of that word whether it's simple or whether it's a little bit more difficult, more prophetic or more pastoral. We want to just eat the word of God and we want to make it in the rapture. We want our children. We want our families to make it. Lord, help us dear Jesus is my prayer.
