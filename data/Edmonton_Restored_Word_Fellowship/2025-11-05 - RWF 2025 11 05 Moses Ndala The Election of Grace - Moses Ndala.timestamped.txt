[7:40] You are healing and grace our hearts always hunger. Oh. Oh, our hearts always hunger for
[7:58] you know I was uh I was just uh meditating on the word uh from Sunday and um I was just
[8:07] thinking about patience and looking at my life and uh even the life of our prophet. You know,
[8:17] there were times that you you hear him saying, "I just had to wait for that thing to happen before
[8:24] I can pray for whoever, whatever." And whenever he there were times that he would he'll be quick,
[8:32] he go before that thing happens, everything before everything falls in line, and it would never work.
[8:41] I I look at my life back um when I lost my job in 2014. I was uh depressed. Nobody knew
[8:52] that even my wife. You know, depression is Satan really will be working with you. You no
[8:59] wonder some people just kill themselves because you'll be dealing with it's a personal thing,
[9:04] you know. It's just like faith. You faith is a personal thing. But this one is on the negative,
[9:11] you know. But one thing that uh taught me faith and patience, I was introduced to fishing. You
[9:19] know, you know how you put your your you you have to wait. If you don't have patience, you you're
[9:25] just going to leave, right? You wait until it starts biting. And it may take may go the whole
[9:30] day and it will only bite once or twice. Even when it bites, it doesn't mean you're going to catch
[9:39] So really Sunday's message was so good. I felt so happy. I was like, you know, patience. We
[9:46] need patience. God give me more patience with myself, with you, with your people, with everybody
[9:54] around me so I can be a better father, a better brother, and a better bride. Amen.

[31:40] in the house of the Lord. Amen. Amen. I I salute you and I greet you in the name of
[31:45] the Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. I'll go to the word of God as I only have a few moments here and
[31:53] u just want to convey the greetings of brother Victor as well and just want to called me today
[32:03] and we've been exchanging before time difference but we managed to talk today confirming that it's
[32:11] coming this weekend and just thank God for that. that will be here and thank God and if I if I had
[32:20] known a little bit earlier confirmation a little bit earlier the schedule could have been a little
[32:25] bit different but since I was not sure so many unpredictability in Africa so just I wanted to
[32:34] let him until things get sorted out and confirmed and it'll be on on on Sunday on Wednesday on on on
[32:46] Saturday and on Sunday we're going to meet and then talk a little bit more but we are
[32:51] happy that he's here unfortunately sister day be staying and in Africa so so we we'll talk more
[33:01] find out but we are happy that Lis is here can help us well and when I'm away can help
[33:08] um I don't know if you put the announcement I didn't but I probably put the announcement we
[33:13] have so we have service on brother Jeanasi will take the service on on on this coming Sunday and
[33:23] um and after that be brother Steven do I'll be away brother Gideon Gideon and the 30th the 30th

[33:44] take that service but um if he's not there I might take it as well and then after that brother Nelson
[33:50] brother Nelson actually wanted to take the 30th but I said no I'll be away so much but can't take
[33:58] that one so pushed him back on the 7th but at 7th we might have communion as well it's the Sunday
[34:07] of communion that fall on that Sunday so just confirm when you come back it my for his birthday.
[34:18] He has been has been planning shall I say it? Can I say it? Can I say it? He's been planning
[34:28] a batism on his birthday. So that thank God for that. So he's a little bit sad when I
[34:40] said communion because it's going to interfere with desire of baptism. But just keep that in
[34:48] the Lord's in the Lord's hand. Amen. Um besides that, I invite you to go to Deuteronomy chapter 7.
[35:05] Let's continue praying for brother Ed. seems to be it looks good and still looks good and everything
[35:14] but um certainly behind the scene it's affecting him just need to keep him in prayer. Amen.
[35:25] Deuteronomy chapter 7
[35:40] verse
[35:44] verse six
[35:47] say for thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy God has chosen thee to be
[35:55] a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the earth. Amen. Amen.
[36:04] The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you because you were more in number
[36:10] than any people, for you were the fewest of all people. But because the Lord loved you,
[36:18] and because he would keep the oath which he had swn unto your fathers,
[36:23] had the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of the bond man,
[36:31] from the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. May God bless you and have your seat. Amen.
[36:46] before I travel and before I just felt like to touch a little bit on the on God's grace
[36:53] for a moment here and uh as you stay and might uh whatever whichever the Lord will feel to lead and
[37:03] speak um might be correction might be instruction might be wherever the Lord chooses to go as a as
[37:12] well be away and just f want to I just felt to leave a little bit of foundation of grace so that
[37:20] um so that yeah so that you know remember that it's by grace that God saved you and God chose
[37:28] you. Amen. and u and but but the zik is there he will be closing and so he will be if it's too hot
[37:36] he will be putting a little bit of oil so that people don't go heads down so so he's a pastor
[37:47] he knows how to to handle it but just felt to to leave that foundation so just in case anything
[37:54] hard the lord will lead but still it's we just leave that to the lord to lead. But the church,
[38:00] like I said, it's a good church. You you're mature, you know, you accept whichever
[38:04] God leads. It's just you accept it and say, "Amen." Thank you, Lord, for correction. Um,
[38:10] but I just fa to speak a bit of an on grace. As he as he's speaking to Israel, he says,
[38:17] "Thought and holy people unto the Lord thy God. The God that God has chosen thee to be a special
[38:23] people unto himself." So, it's God's choosing. So the election is of grace is God's choosing.
[38:31] God has chosen them. God has has put his eyes upon Israel because he wanted them to be special unto
[38:39] himself above all other people that are upon the earth. This natural Israel and he loved them. The
[38:47] Bible says God did not did not set his love upon Israel nor choose Israel because they were more in
[38:54] number than any other people. But but he says you are the fewest of all the people. In other words,
[39:00] you can say you you you are maybe even the weakest of all the people. Moses will call
[39:05] them stiff stiff necked people. But but God still loved them. God still chose them. God still prefer
[39:13] them above any other people to the point that even today if you say one word against Israel,
[39:19] if you curse Israel, you are you there's a curse upon you. If you bless Israel, you are blessed.
[39:25] just to show how much God loved them. He still loves them. Amen. That's that the love of God.
[39:31] And the same now that's in the natural Israel. Now think about the spiritual Israel. Think about you
[39:36] and I. You know that Israel Israel when they will be restored. There will be the 144,000.
[39:43] They will be restored. They'll be restored. But there will still be the servants. But you and I,
[39:47] we are the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ. We have special importance in the eyes of God. Amen. And
[39:54] to realize that it should give us comfort. To realize that should give us rest. To realize
[39:59] that should give us joy. Amen. To know that I'm so special in the eyes of God. Amen. I didn't
[40:06] choose him. He chose me. It's by grace that I'm being saved. By grace that I've been redeemed
[40:12] because he chose me. The same way that he chose Israel even chose me. Amen. Says because the Lord
[40:19] loved thee. Because the Lord loved Israel. the same thing for you and me because the Lord loved
[40:25] you. Amen. Praise be to God. God chose Israel not because of their size, not because of their power,
[40:32] not because of their special qualities. No, he chose them just the way they were simple people.
[40:38] But God loved them. Amen. God loved Abraham not because Abraham was special. Not Abraham
[40:45] was intellectual. Abraham did a lot of actions or or did a lot of good things or good services. No,
[40:51] God just put his eyes upon Abraham to Gabbraham, I love you. I choose you and I will give you an
[40:57] inheritance. Amen. What have you done? Nothing. But I will give you I will make you a father of
[41:04] nations. Amen. Wow. Why Abraham? Yes. Because God is sovereign and his grace is sovereign. He has
[41:11] put his eyes upon Abraham and he loved Abraham. Glory to God. Praise be to God. Amen. Paul will
[41:19] take that. It says in 1 Corinthians 15 1:10 says, "For I am the least of the all the apostles."
[41:26] Think about it. Apostle Paul was the one who persecuted the Christians. the one who was who was
[41:32] even approving the killing of Stephen, he was the one who's he was putting them in jails doing so
[41:39] evil things to the point where when God God saved him or met him on the way to the to Damascus and
[41:47] then then and then and he told his prophet no you have to go and pray for Paul the prophet even have
[41:53] to question God are you really sure I'm putting my terms there are you really is the one was
[41:58] killing how can I go and bless him. No, no, no. That's beyond my understanding. In other words,
[42:06] if if Satan is looking and see how God has done in your life, you look behind. But this is the
[42:11] person was lying. It was a person was stealing. The person was doing these bad things. How can you
[42:16] save them? They don't deserve it. Yes, they don't deserve it. But my grace is upon them. I have
[42:22] chosen them. Praise be to God. He says, I have chosen him and he has a great work to do for me.
[42:29] Glory be to God. God could have put in you in the first age, on the second age, on the third age,
[42:35] but he put you in the seventh age for you to experience the rapture. Are you better than
[42:40] Paul? No. But God has put you by grace in that age. Amen. To magnify how great he is. God delight
[42:49] himself in his grace. Glory to God. Praise be to God. Then he says, "I'm the least of the apostles
[42:56] and I'm not meant to be called an apostle, but because I persecuted the church of God, but by the
[43:02] grace of God, I am what I am." Who are you? How come you are what you are? It's not me. It's the
[43:10] grace of God in my life. We are nothing outside of God's grace. Amen. I like that song. Crisism
[43:17] song. I see the that that's not my righteousness. It's God's righteousness. Amen. Where would I be
[43:24] if God's grace didn't meet me? Where would I be? Would be all lost. No one can present
[43:28] himself before God as being righteous. It's only God's grace. And he says, "And his grace which was
[43:36] bestowed upon me was not in vain, but I labored more abundantly than they all." Says, "Why? Yet
[43:43] not I, but the grace of God which was with me." Amen. In other words, we say the grace of God has
[43:50] labored a lot through me. How can you do those things? It's not me. Amen. Once you have the
[43:56] revelation of the grace of God, actually you don't become arrogant. When you have the revelation of
[44:02] the grace of God, realize that it's not you. It was only given to you by God's desire and God's
[44:09] purpose, God's election. Everything is about God electing. We didn't choose him. He chose us. Look
[44:17] at the disciples. It they didn't choose him. They were not looking for him. They so we we we all we
[44:22] are looking everywhere for you and then we found you. No, it was him going around and said you I
[44:28] choose you. You I choose you. You I choose you. Follow me. Follow me. Follow me. Follow me. The
[44:34] same thing for you. Amen. Sometimes we Oh, I hope that we don't forget that someone who talks to you
[44:41] and share with you a book of the message and share with you. Oh, it was God's grace coming to you and
[44:48] calling you. Amen. Many people the word of God has been shared to them, but it just passed over their
[44:53] head. They don't understand. They don't know. Well, what are you believing? Are you a cult?
[44:57] And they don't understand. But God put something inside of you that can respond to that. Says, "Oh,
[45:03] that's my name being called." Amen. When the message is being preached, your name is being
[45:08] called. The mystery reveal. It's your name. Amen. You can identify to that. What identification?
[45:14] Your name is your identification. Amen. The message when it's being preached, you identify
[45:18] to that. That's my identification. That me that correspond to the truth. How come they don't see
[45:24] it? I see it so clearly. Amen. God's grace. It's like an image in a sculpture. You know, sometimes
[45:31] they put an image in a sculpture. Can't you see brother in that mountain there? You know, I was
[45:36] showing to my kids one. Can't you see, brother? I don't see daddy. I don't see. I don't see. Then
[45:41] one of them caught it. So, oh, I see it. The other ones, but I don't see at all. I don't see. And
[45:47] then finally, oh, I see. I see. I see. Oh, I see. I see. Amen. Praise be to God. The same thing with
[45:56] the message of the hour. People don't see it, but you see it. Oh, I see. My name is written in the
[46:03] book of life. No one can erase it. Amen. Even my own mistakes, even your own decisions cannot erase
[46:11] your name from the lamb's book of life. Amen. You might try, you might try, but he will pull
[46:16] you. You have already swollen the bait. You can't go nowhere. You will just hurt yourself. You will
[46:23] come back no matter what. Amen. That's the power of the election of the grace of God in your life.
[46:30] You can't send yourself to hell. Impossible. If you are the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ, you
[46:36] will come back no matter what because his purpose of election must be fulfilled. Praise be to God.
[46:44] Oh, we thank God for that. So when you are coming into prayer, you don't come begging. So God change
[46:51] your plan, make me your son, make me your daughter today. No, you are a daughter of God. You are a
[46:58] son of God. Keep believing what God has promised. God, thank you for your grace in my life. I thank
[47:04] you for your grace. Your grace changed me. Your grace called me. Your grace justified
[47:09] me. Your grace sanctified me. Your grace gave me the Holy Ghost. Your grace healed me. Your grace
[47:16] will provide to my needs. Your grace will give me the rapture. Amen. Glory to God. Amen. Amen.
[47:28] With the grace of God, you don't come to prove to God that you are a son of God. You don't come
[47:33] to God to prove that you are a Christian. Lord, I want to prove that I'm a Christian, so accept
[47:38] me. No, no, no, no. He accept you and then he prove that you already accept you. So your life
[47:45] that you are living, it's proving that he already accepted me. You're not living to be accepted. No,
[47:50] you have been accepted and then you are proving that you have been accepted. God chose you before.
[47:57] Amen. Glory to God. Our attitude is not God, I want to show that you can choose me now. No,
[48:03] no, no, no. God already chose you and now God, I live the life I'm living because you expressed to
[48:09] me that you chose me. That's why he was telling to Israel and they made the biggest mistakes.
[48:15] Oh no God, I want to choose the law so I can prove to you that I can do something to you and then
[48:21] then then you can choose me. And I said, "No, no, no. That's the greatest mistake. I've given you a
[48:26] prophet. I've given you the pillow fire. I given you the cloud." Doesn't that represent something
[48:32] to you? I've given you all these things. Now you have to accept in it and walk in it. Wherever the
[48:37] clouds go, you go. Wherever the purifier goes, you go. Amen. That's your grace. Amen. That's what we
[48:43] have accepted. Amen. We are accepting the word of God. We just follow where the where the word of
[48:48] God says. See the word says this. We say amen. The purifier goes there. We say amen. Amen. We we want
[48:54] healing. We just we just look at that so at the present serpent. Look and see. Look and live. We
[49:00] look at it and we are healed. Praise be to God. Is it yourself who healed? No. It's the grace of God.
[49:06] Can you imagine just looking at the brazen serpent and you are healed? Wow. Wow. That's right. Moses,
[49:17] can you tell for two for two, thou two million people, how do you do heal? Dr. Moses, what is
[49:22] your prescription? My only pres prescription that I have, the Lord health all thy diseases.
[49:29] Amen. Oh, praise be to God. And for those who sin, what? And look, the serpent. Oh, no. That
[49:34] they just need to look and look and leave. Just look at us that it's provided. The same thing
[49:39] for us. Amen. When we come in prayer, Lord, you have already provided. Help me just to look and
[49:46] live. Help me to believe. Help me to accept the provided way. The provided way of grace,
[49:53] grace, grace, grace. When the capstone comes down, what is shouting? Grace, grace, grace,
[50:01] grace to the right. What is shalom to the bride? Grace. Amen. Everything is about grace. Amen.
[50:14] Romans 11:5 says says even even so then at this present time are there there is
[50:21] a remnant according to the election of grace for if by grace then it is no more of works
[50:26] and otherwise grace is no more grace but if it is of works then there is no more grace
[50:32] otherwise work is no more work then Israel had not obtained that which is it seeketh
[50:39] For for the election had obtained it and the rest were blinded. The election obtained it. What is
[50:45] going to give you perfection? Your perfection is not by yourself. Your perfection is election.
[50:52] Amen. Our perfection through the blood of Jesus Christ is election. Because we were elected,
[50:58] that's why he died. He died. He died. He He died. The lamb was slain before the foundation of the
[51:06] world because he could not lose us because he already predestinated us. That's why he died.
[51:13] Amen. Because he was already predestinated us. So the perfection was already done way before we even
[51:20] came. So when God is looking at you, he's not looking at you in the special time that you are
[51:25] going through the portion of time. He's looking at you the way he saw you before the foundation of
[51:30] the world. He's looking at you on the perfection. Amen. And in the time you are working through it,
[51:36] you are living through it and you're asking God grace and all the different things. But
[51:41] when you have the revelation, you Lord, I'm not trying to become something that I was not. I'm
[51:47] trying to become what you already made me from the beginning. I want to be what you know about me,
[51:54] Lord. I want to accept what the word of God says about me. The flesh is telling you something else.
[52:00] Amen. because it's corrupt, it perverse, it will put you down. It's telling you something different
[52:05] from who you are. Amen. But now by faith you are look, you are claiming what you are. Lord,
[52:11] I am a son of God. Lord, this thing is bothering me and these things, oh father,
[52:15] Lord, may you take it away because it's not part of me. It's not part of me because it's
[52:20] not part of you. I am part of you, Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise be to God for his grace. Amen.
[52:33] I like what Paul says. For by grace I am what I am. And his grace which was bestowed upon me
[52:39] was not in vain. The grace was not found vain. For grace in in Paul was not found vain. God's
[52:48] grace is not empty. Is not ineffective in in those who receive it by by faith. It transforms. God's
[52:55] grace transforms. God grace redeems. God's grace sustains us. It's marvelous indeed to look back
[53:02] on on on one's life and see the grace that was born that has borne fruit. Amen. First Corinthians
[53:11] 15:15. For by grace of God I am what I am. And his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain.
[53:19] The grace in your life is not in vain. The grace in my life is not in vain because it has done
[53:25] great things. Today God has done great things and it is still producing great things. God's grace
[53:31] in our life has produced faith has produced humility has produced good works. Amen. God's
[53:37] grace like he said in Ephesians 2 8:9 for by grace are you saved through faith and not of yourself.
[53:44] It is the gift of God not of works lest any man should boast. Amen. It just shows that salvation,
[53:52] every spiritual blessings come not from our merit but it's from God God unearned favor. All is just
[54:01] God's grace in our life. The good works you can do. You can be a good preacher. You can be you can
[54:06] be healing the sick. You can be performing all the great miracles. You can be have a gift of help. A
[54:12] gift of singing. Whatever you have, it's just God's grace. Amen. Glory to God. By his grace,
[54:21] we have been saved. His grace will save us also in the future. His grace has accompanied
[54:26] us through our life. Look into your life. You'll see how he spared you from accident from different
[54:32] things. It was just God's grace in your life. Sometimes you will cross you'll cross you you
[54:38] you'll cross you are riding and then you cross a certain road. You arrive then you even wonder
[54:42] oh that light was real green or red. You don't remember. You just passed it and you just went
[54:49] God grace sometimes as brothers brother Boris expressing but as happening many times in my
[54:55] life has happened so many times you're driving and sometimes you are sleeping and and you do

[55:19] Something wakes you up just on time. God's grace. Amen. You can't wake yourself up. Oh,
[55:28] sometimes we come through trials. We forget God's grace. Count numerous blessings your
[55:33] life. You will see how you are blessed. God has blessed you as many things because of his grace.
[55:46] Psalm 5:12 David experiences for thou Lord will bless the righteous with favor that will compass
[55:52] him as a wild shield. The same thing for David. It was just in the ship called from nowhere
[55:57] where he was hiding even his father neglecting him rejecting him in in the sense that he he does not
[56:04] deserve to be a king. The prophet comes and looked at only his other brother but Jo David is not even
[56:11] there. And the father doesn't even consider him. But God goes all the way there and pick him up
[56:17] from where he was. Not even aware that someone is looking for him. God picks him up and says,
[56:23] "You are the man after my heart." And he present that tiny little big thing. You are the man after
[56:30] my heart. The same thing for you. from where you were. God went and pick you up from the place
[56:36] where you were and brought you here to display you in the front of the people. This is my daughter.
[56:43] This is my This is my son. I've chosen them even though the world has neglected them, but they are
[56:50] my favorite one. Peculiar people above any other people, special in God's eyes. Glory to God. Oh,
[56:59] for me it just blows my mind. Amen. Amen. Without doing anything that Oh, God's grace. God's grace.
[57:11] His grace has guided us. He has preserved us. He has comforted us. Even his grace has punished us
[57:19] in certain things. You're doing something wrong. And you know, many times, oh, I was a student. I
[57:25] just put it many times at school. I was there. I said, I've never I've never cheat. I've never
[57:30] cheat by God's. I've never cheat. And I was at university one time. It was just so hard. You

[57:49] the book. I just copy the whole answer from the book and it was a difficult question and I copy
[57:56] everything and I put it. You know what happened? I got two out of 20. Two out of 20. And in Africa,
[58:04] you can't even complain. You can't even tell him. That's a right answer because he knows that
[58:09] you cheated. And I got two out of 20. My And my neighbor have been confessed. I was a Christian.
[58:15] I told him I'm a Christian. I tried my best not to cheat on that cross for all. But at the end,
[58:21] I kind of failed on that one. So he Moses, you cheated. You know later on in life what
[58:27] he came to that that man came later on he became a preacher of the message but he testified on he
[58:35] was like oh brother Moses was so faithfully tried so I failed on that exam and so God banished me
[58:41] and then we had to redo the exam God I know you punished me on that exam so it came again that

[59:38] but he knows his children. This little, you know, you you humiliated me in front of that young man.
[59:43] You don't know what I have in on purpose for him because he knew later on you'll make him
[59:48] a minister. So, I should have been a testimony back then. He punished me so hard. Another man
[59:54] I confessed and then he just let me pass. Oh, praise be to God. So his grace punished us. His

[1:01:07] us. His grace delivered us. His grace caused our justification, our sanctification, our cleansing,
[1:01:14] our preparation for service. His grace gave us the Holy Spirit. No one can give you the Holy Spirit.
[1:01:20] No pastor, no minister, no evangelist, and no one, no prophet can give you the Holy Ghost. Only God
[1:01:27] can give you the Holy Ghost. We preach that you must be born again. But no one can give you the

[1:08:56] Sister
[1:08:59] brother and can help me papa mat and sister.
[1:09:08] Um I just want to thank the Lord uh for healing me. Um I was just uh cleaning out um a drawer
[1:09:17] in our bathroom or whatever and throwing out a whole bunch of stuff. Um and I found a cream that
[1:09:23] um the doctor had given me to use um on this rush that would come back um continually and
[1:09:33] um I had um given testimony before saying that um even though I I haven't seen um the healing yet
[1:09:48] um the fruits of it, I'm still claiming it and thanking the Lord. And when I saw that cream,
[1:09:55] I just I said in my heart again, I said to the Lord, I was like, I don't I don't need this.
[1:09:59] I'm not using it. I'm not allowing for there to be any credit to any doctor or to any man.
[1:10:08] The the healing goes to the Lord. The glory goes to the Lord. So, I just threw it in the garbage.
[1:10:14] And um I noticed that it spread to another part of my body, but I said to the Lord, I was like,
[1:10:22] "Just because it spread doesn't mean you're not a healer." And I just keep thanking the Lord for
[1:10:27] it. And I told the Lord that I would just give testimony again because the Lord really impressed
[1:10:31] upon my heart that as John Ryan just kept going around testifying and handing out the newspapers
[1:10:38] and thanking the Lord, that we're supposed to do that, too. So, I just want to say thank you,
[1:10:43] Lord. And um there had been a song um that had come to my heart in the morning um about um the
[1:10:53] the blood of Jesus and the stripes that he took for our healing. Um and that by his stripes we
[1:10:59] are healed. Um and uh I had wanted to sing it as a song special and it it just didn't work
[1:11:06] out at the time, but the word of the Lord is true and I just want to thank the Lord for that. So,
[1:11:11] thank you Lord for my healing. And um I just have a prayer request. Andrew had shared with me that
[1:11:17] um one of his co-workers or whatever um is going through something right now. Um and
[1:11:25] uh him and his spouse are are not in agreeance and um the man is concerned about um his marriage. And
[1:11:36] I said to Drew um at supper time tonight, I said um even if they're not serving the Lord,
[1:11:44] the Lord can still come on the scene for their marriage. And um so just remember them in your
[1:11:51] prayers, I believe that the Lord can help them to sort out their problems and to keep their
[1:11:57] marriage together. Correct. It's important. Amen. Thank you. Thank you, Sister Kine. Amen. Amen.
