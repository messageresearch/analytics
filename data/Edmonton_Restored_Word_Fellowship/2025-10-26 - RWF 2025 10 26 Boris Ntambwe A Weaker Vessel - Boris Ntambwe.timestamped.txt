[37:37] All to thee, my blessed
[37:42] savior.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; I surrender.

[38:20] Amen.
[38:24] [Music]
[38:26] Amen.
[38:28] [Music]
[38:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[38:35] And um as I was talking to Pastor Moses,
[38:40] I told him
[38:42] I you know when I was uh back in
[38:44] Winnipeg knowing that I was coming this
[38:46] way
[38:48] and um before even that you know some
[38:51] message start coming up on my heart and
[38:53] I thought maybe this is what God wants
[38:55] me to to share with you and it was kept
[38:58] on coming and taking note and taking
[39:01] note and taking note and I came prepared
[39:03] here knowing that uh Saturday I'll lay
[39:06] my foundation and Sunday I I'll I I'll
[39:10] finish the message but for some reason
[39:14] um things have changed completely and
[39:17] and know God taking me into different
[39:20] direction
[39:21] &gt;&gt; and uh you know when I was last night
[39:24] was very difficult.
[39:26] I have so many messages. I changed my
[39:29] message I think three times last night
[39:31] praying out to the Lord. What do you
[39:32] want me to say this morning? Oh God,
[39:35] &gt;&gt; you know it's not easy. It's not easy.
[39:37] Um because he's the one who knows. We
[39:40] don't preach to impress people.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; No.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; And we don't preach for people to to to
[39:45] to know that we know something.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; No, it really to address the needs and
[39:49] to make sure that as you come to church,
[39:51] you can go home and say, "Truly, the
[39:53] Lord has spoken unto me." and uh
[39:56] something that can help us in this
[39:57] journey. We know all of us. We are in
[40:00] this journey in this pilgrimage. We need
[40:01] encouragement. Uh we need somebody to
[40:04] hold our hands and to walk with us, you
[40:07] know. And it's so wonderful to know that
[40:09] we have a friend and his name is Jesus.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; And um so um this um this morning I was
[40:16] thinking to bring a message. I brought
[40:18] this message a long time ago. Um but I
[40:21] trying to take another angle a little
[40:22] bit today. Um my message this morning is
[40:25] a weaker vessel. So let us stand and I
[40:28] appreciate all the uh the special songs
[40:31] and beautiful voices here. God rich you
[40:33] bless you s leaders and
[40:35] &gt;&gt; musician. Thank you so much.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah
[40:40] and um we are going to go to Genesis
[40:43] chapter 2.
[40:47] I also want to express my gratitude to
[40:49] all of you to pastor Zcloud for uh
[40:51] making it happen.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh
[40:58] I uh
[41:02] I really appreciate the confidence that
[41:04] you placed in me to be back again here.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; Thanks so much.
[41:11] um Genesis chapter 2 verse 21
[41:15] um which I just read um so I get
[41:21] verse 21 to
[41:24] um 20
[41:27] what I say just chapter 2 yeah
[41:31] 21-23
[41:34] and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to
[41:38] fall upon Adam, and he slept. And he
[41:42] took one of his ribs, and closed up the
[41:45] flesh instead thereof. And the rib which
[41:48] the Lord had taken from a man, made he a
[41:52] woman, and brought her unto the man. And
[41:56] Adam said, "This is now bone of my
[41:59] bones, and flesh of my flesh. She shall
[42:03] be called woman
[42:06] because she was taken out of men.
[42:10] May the Lord bless the reading of the
[42:12] word.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; I want to make sure I have my time here
[42:15] so I don't go over.
[42:18] Let us pray.
[42:20] Our gracious heavenly father, we thank
[42:23] you for your love and grace, for the
[42:24] breath of life you've given us this
[42:26] morning to come into your house, Lord
[42:28] Jesus. Father, today the whole world is
[42:31] commemorating the resurrection of
[42:33] Christ. But as we've come to your church
[42:36] uh to church, Father, this morning, we
[42:39] just don't want to commemorate your
[42:41] resurrection. But we want, oh God, you
[42:44] to manifest the proof of your
[42:46] resurrection in our midst that you are
[42:48] the risen Christ who can touch hearts,
[42:50] who can heal our bodies and heal our
[42:52] souls, transform things around us. Oh
[42:54] God, give us joy and peace, oh God,
[42:56] through this journey. Mighty God, we are
[42:58] calling you on the scene. Come and take
[43:00] over the service. Take me aside. Lord,
[43:03] I'm not a good preacher, but you be Lord
[43:05] the preacher this morning. Mighty God,
[43:07] let beyond the voice of a mortal. Lord,
[43:10] they may hear the still small voice, the
[43:13] voice of the Holy Spirit speaking
[43:15] directly to their hearts. Oh father,
[43:18] bless the pastor and appreciate the
[43:20] invitation, Lord. May you be with us, oh
[43:22] God. And we dedicate the service in your
[43:24] hand. In the blessed name of Jesus, we
[43:26] have prayed. Amen.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated. And we
[43:31] are going again to turn our Bible in uh
[43:33] 1 Peter chapter 3:7.
[43:40] Likewise,
[43:42] ye husbands, dwell with them according
[43:44] to knowledge, giving honor unto the wife
[43:47] as unto the weaker vessel, and as being
[43:51] hes together of the grace of life, that
[43:53] your prayers be not hindered.
[43:56] Amen.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; You know, we used to read these
[43:59] scriptures when we're in denominations
[44:02] and different things, but by God's
[44:04] grace, he sent us a prophet. And with
[44:07] the opening of the word,
[44:09] &gt;&gt; we we know that one of the mysteries
[44:12] that God was to reveal for us in this
[44:14] hour was the mystery of uh the church as
[44:17] um the bride of Christ.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; And uh we know that that mystery brother
[44:23] Brandham refer uh to Ephesians chapter 5
[44:27] verse 28 where the Bible says so ought
[44:29] to men to love their wives
[44:32] &gt;&gt; as their own bodies. Hallelujah.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; I preach a lot to marriage is that I
[44:36] like this subject so much.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Because the whole Bible is about
[44:41] marriage.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Redemption is about marriage. The Old
[44:44] Testament, the New Testament, marriage.
[44:46] The sun and the moon marriage.
[44:48] Hallelujah. the heaven and the earth,
[44:50] woman and wife. So redemption, our
[44:53] relationship with God is tapped as a
[44:56] tapped as a as a marriage relationship.
[44:58] Israel and and God is as is as marriage
[45:01] as well. So marriage is the whole story
[45:04] of the Bible.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; And the Bible opens up with marriage.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Then the Bible closes with marriage.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So there's no way you can
[45:13] you can escape.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; So when you're talking about marriage,
[45:16] we are talking about redemption. We are
[45:18] talking about our own lives with Christ.
[45:20] Amen. So it says here, "So ought men to
[45:22] love their wives
[45:24] &gt;&gt; as their own bodies." You know, I always
[45:26] tell people, if you love your body, you
[45:28] take care of it.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; You feed it, you buy some lotion, some
[45:35] stuff, and you know, you make sure that
[45:37] everything goes well. So in love there
[45:40] is care.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Because you love your body, you take
[45:42] care of it. So love is to to take care
[45:44] as well, you know. And um he that loveth
[45:47] his wife loveth himself.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; For no man ever yet hated his own flesh,
[45:53] but nourisheth and cherisheth
[45:56] &gt;&gt; even as the Lord the church.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; So they're saying the Lord does the same
[46:00] thing for the church.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Now keep in mind that our marriages they
[46:05] are just a partial realization
[46:08] &gt;&gt; because it's a shadow.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Our marriages are not the true marriage.
[46:13] The true marriage, the uh perfect
[46:17] realization of marriage is the marriage
[46:19] of the lamb.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; So we all in this relationship of
[46:24] marriage, we are just trying to to be a
[46:27] partial realization trying to portray
[46:30] Christ as the husband in the house and
[46:31] the woman trying to portray Christ uh
[46:33] the church as a wife in the house. Amen.
[46:37] So we are members of his body, of his
[46:39] flesh and of his bones. Amen. For this
[46:42] cause shall man leave his father and
[46:44] mother, and shall be joined unto his
[46:46] wife, and they too shall be one flesh.
[46:49] This is a great mystery. And but I speak
[46:52] concerning Christ and the church. So
[46:56] spiritually speaking, the church is
[46:59] always represented by a woman in the
[47:02] Bible.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; In the me what shall I do with Christ?
[47:06] Jesus preached in 1963. But I'm saying
[47:09] this, the church is always,
[47:14] &gt;&gt; not sometimes,
[47:16] &gt;&gt; always
[47:18] &gt;&gt; represented by a woman cuz the bride of
[47:21] Christ is a woman. Even was the even Oh,
[47:25] sorry. Eve was the one fell.
[47:28] She's the one to be redeemed. And the
[47:31] church is what is a woman that is
[47:33] redeemed.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Is that wonderful? Amen.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; You know, many times, one time I there's
[47:40] a young lady at work
[47:44] and I asked her, "What is love?"
[47:49] And she show she told me, "Love is a
[47:52] feeling."
[47:53] I said, "Love is a feeling." I I said,
[47:55] "I don't I don't think love is a
[47:56] feeling."
[47:58] And one day I preached at church. I
[48:00] said, "Love is a character."
[48:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the book of Corinthian, not
[48:06] me.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Love is patient. Love is this. Love is
[48:10] this. Love is this. Love is this. So
[48:12] love is not a feeling.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; No.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; If you say you have love, you have a
[48:17] character.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; That character is called love.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; So I said, well, when you say you love
[48:24] somebody, what do you love?
[48:27] You say I love you. What is you? Because
[48:32] you is uh Bam told us that and the Bible
[48:35] says we are a three-fold being.
[48:40] You have a body,
[48:42] you have a spirit, you have a soul. So
[48:45] your body has the five senses. Your
[48:48] spirit has also five senses.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; And your soul has only one sense which
[48:52] is either faith or unbelief.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Now when you say I love you,
[48:58] what do you love? You love my body.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; If you love just my body, it be like you
[49:05] just love chicken.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Hey.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; Let's ask chicken if the chicken loves
[49:12] you.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; The chicken said, "No, that guy, I don't
[49:16] love him."
[49:17] &gt;&gt; Because for him to love me, I have to
[49:18] make a supreme sacrifice. Give my life
[49:21] that may love me. So if you love
[49:23] chicken,
[49:25] &gt;&gt; the chicken doesn't love you.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; It is selfish love. Amen. Amen.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; It's a love that is looking at your own
[49:33] interest.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; And many people when they get married, a
[49:39] lot of marriages,
[49:40] love is only at two dimension.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; The body.
[49:47] And if the body is what can keep a
[49:49] marriage, why do we why do we have
[49:51] divorces?
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Good question.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; And you may say, well, he's an engineer,
[50:01] all that guy. He's a nice guy,
[50:03] hardworking person. That the level of a
[50:05] spirit,
[50:07] &gt;&gt; your ability to work,
[50:10] to understand, to analyze, you are using
[50:13] your five senses.
[50:15] But most of the problem that we have in
[50:16] our relationship
[50:19] is the third level,
[50:21] &gt;&gt; the depth of your being. It's your soul.
[50:25] Because your soul is your nature, your
[50:28] behavior. All the behavioral issue is at
[50:30] the level of the soul. But the Bible
[50:33] says he that loves his body
[50:36] take takes care of it.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; So if you love you take care
[50:44] &gt;&gt; and love is not receiving. By the way,
[50:48] many time you hear people, you don't
[50:49] love me.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; You don't love me. Why? Oh, I love you,
[50:54] but you don't love me because I asked
[50:56] you this. You You didn't do this for me.
[50:58] You didn't do this for me. So, people
[50:59] think love is receiving.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; If you are hungry
[51:04] and I I give you $5 to buy a loaf of
[51:07] bread,
[51:09] you did you that received the $5, you
[51:12] did not express love. I'm the one who
[51:14] has expressed love by giving it.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Love in all aspect is always giving.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; You get to give something. God so loved
[51:24] the world that he gave his only begotten
[51:26] son.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; So in other word something that you have
[51:30] &gt;&gt; but you have to give to the benefit of
[51:33] the person that you love.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; In other word love is a sacrificial.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; If you say you love somebody, you are
[51:41] ready to make sacrifices.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; There's no place for selfishness.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; No.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; So if you if you do if if you are still
[51:51] selfish, you are not ready for marriage.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; No.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Because marriage is really to deny
[51:57] yourself.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; You invest your whole being to the for
[52:00] the happiness of the person you are
[52:02] living with.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; And it is not one way. It must be two
[52:06] ways.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; And husband and wife both doing the
[52:10] same.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; So when we see most of the issues that
[52:14] we have in marriages are behavioral
[52:16] issues. M
[52:17] &gt;&gt; I don't like the way you talk to me.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; I don't like this. I don't like that. I
[52:21] don't like that. I don't like that. You
[52:22] know, but we get to the point where we
[52:24] forget the principle of Christianity.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; That God say in the book of Leviticus
[52:29] that I giving you the blood, the life
[52:32] that is in the blood to fix the soul, to
[52:35] repair the soul. If you know that you
[52:38] are sick and you can go to a doctor to
[52:41] fix the problem. So if you know that
[52:44] this other person has the same sickness
[52:46] or has an issue then you have to take
[52:48] that person to the same doctor.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; If you have experienced salvation and
[52:53] you know there's somebody who can
[52:54] transform the soul of a human being that
[52:57] the blood of Christ is more powerful
[53:01] &gt;&gt; to transform and to change that you can
[53:03] go on your knees and pray for your wife.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; You can go on your knees and pray for
[53:07] your husband and come out with a
[53:09] testimony.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. People don't want to do that
[53:12] anymore. Oh, I'm not your mom to teach
[53:14] you life.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; I want somebody to pray for me. If you
[53:20] love me only when I'm lovable,
[53:22] &gt;&gt; then anybody can love me.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; If you love me because I give you
[53:27] candies, then anybody can love me.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; But I want to be love when I'm
[53:33] unlovable.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Somebody can tell me, you know what? No
[53:37] matter what you do, I still love you.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll be there for you.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; So I call it 3D love.
[53:49] You know we have a 3D movie.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; The movie can be two 2D or 3D.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; And but they say in the 3D it has the
[53:58] depth.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; So for me I call a 3D love is where
[54:01] there's a depth. You have you have
[54:03] reached the depth of love because the
[54:05] Bible say you shall love the Lord your
[54:07] God with your whole being your body your
[54:10] spirit and your soul. So love love has
[54:13] to cover the all areas of your life.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; If you I I was talking to to to my one
[54:22] of my nephew. I said well you God has
[54:24] blessed your dad. You have money you
[54:25] travel. You go all over the place. Now
[54:27] tell me what the difference between you
[54:28] and the other guy whose father says has
[54:31] money, buy cars and do everything for
[54:33] the children.
[54:37] How can you say that you being a a
[54:39] Christian couple, you are different from
[54:41] a non-Christian couple?
[54:43] &gt;&gt; What makes you different?
[54:45] &gt;&gt; There must be something making you
[54:46] different
[54:48] &gt;&gt; because if it's just the body and the
[54:50] spirit, you're not different from the
[54:52] &gt;&gt; non-Christian couples. But there's
[54:54] something about us
[54:56] &gt;&gt; that above this flesh, above everything,
[54:59] we love the soul.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; I want the soul to be saved.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; And if you love the soul, you have
[55:06] reached a the depth of love.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; And when you have your children, you can
[55:13] buy them, gift them, do everything that
[55:15] you can. But many people they are rich.
[55:17] They take already kids. They take them
[55:19] to Mexico. They have fun on the beach,
[55:22] different thing, nice cars and good
[55:24] heritage and homes and different things.
[55:27] But they've neglected the soul.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; They've never taken them to church.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; They've never taken them to Sunday
[55:34] school.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; So that love is just a two-dimensional
[55:37] love.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; But if you really love your children,
[55:40] you want to bring them to church.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you want to take care of
[55:44] all aspect of their life,
[55:46] &gt;&gt; their body, their spirit and their soul.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; So love is sacrificial.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; You have to sacrifice something. You
[55:59] have to sacrifice your time. You have to
[56:00] sacrifice your energy. And that's what
[56:03] Christ did for the bride. He said, "Love
[56:05] your wife as Christ loved the church and
[56:08] gave himself for that church.
[56:12] Everything that he was,
[56:14] &gt;&gt; he poured out for that church.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; He emptied out himself
[56:19] &gt;&gt; for this church to be happy, for this
[56:22] church to be delivered, for this church
[56:24] to be protected.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; So you see, Christ is the perfect
[56:30] realization.
[56:32] But we being here in uh in this partial
[56:36] realization, we still have some flaws,
[56:38] you know,
[56:39] &gt;&gt; but we are so thankful to God we have an
[56:41] unconditioned covenant.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; We can always repent and get back to
[56:44] God.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; So the what I'm saying in in a question
[56:50] answer said he made the buried spirit
[56:52] for the man
[56:56] and made the tender little delicate
[56:59] feminine spirit for the women.
[57:02] So when God created Adam, it was both
[57:05] male and female. So in other words, the
[57:09] tender and the buried spirit were
[57:10] together.
[57:12] Are you there with me?
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Then God say, "It's not good for a man
[57:16] to be alone. I'm going to make him a
[57:19] helpmate."
[57:21] So God separated the burly spirit
[57:25] from the tender part. So when the burly
[57:29] and tender part were together they were
[57:32] it was such it was it was so
[57:34] complimementaryary that there was no way
[57:36] the fall could have happened.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Then God separated the burly spirit from
[57:44] the tender spirit.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; But sometime we read
[57:49] words in the message but sometime
[57:51] getting into the definition of words
[57:53] gives you more understanding.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; What does it be? Does it mean a tender
[57:58] spirit?
[58:01] So the woman was created weaker.
[58:05] It was not a choice.
[58:09] Eve did not become weak after the fall.
[58:13] It was the way she was brought.
[58:16] In other words, it was not her choice.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Because all other females they came
[58:23] different
[58:24] &gt;&gt; from her. So it was not her choice.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; No, I want you to be spiritual as I'm
[58:30] talking now.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Remember I'm telling you I'm talking
[58:33] about you as the woman.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother. I'm a man. Oh, you are you
[58:38] at the church? You are a woman.
[58:43] Hallelujah.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; So the woman, it was not her fault. It
[58:51] was not even her choice.
[58:54] She was just a victim of circumstances
[58:57] that she did not choose.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; It was not her desire to become that
[59:02] way. It was God's own decision for a
[59:05] purpose.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Until when the purpose was fulfilled,
[59:11] God knew that that the reason why I made
[59:13] her this way.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; And the purpose of God was to cause the
[59:19] fall. But say God created that way to
[59:24] cause the fall. So God was the origin of
[59:27] the cause of the fall.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; He was able to make it in a way that the
[59:31] fall would have never happened.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; But he wanted to express his attribute
[59:35] as a savior, as a healer, as a redeemer.
[59:38] But for he has to do something.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Now those attributes could be
[59:44] manifested.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; It's so wonderful. God sent a prophet.
[59:49] Don't you feel that way too?
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Because we understand we can't complain.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Now
[59:56] the body of a woman is weaker. We know
[59:58] that. And um men physically they have an
[1:00:03] advantage over a man of a women. you
[1:00:06] know they they have stronger
[1:00:09] most strength and they can uh have a um
[1:00:13] endurance and you know you cannot see uh
[1:00:17] in a in a box uh a man competing with a
[1:00:20] woman you know it can't it can't work.
[1:00:23] You can't see in a football a female uh
[1:00:27] uh team with a male team. They don't put
[1:00:31] them together.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; So the world agrees
[1:00:36] because they don't put them together.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; We are built different. Our bodies looks
[1:00:41] different. We have different roles in
[1:00:43] life.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Even though today we have some crazy
[1:00:46] things happening in the world.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; One man said, "No, I'm a woman."
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to be in the in the NBA of
[1:00:57] women.
[1:00:58] And then they say, "What? He's she is or
[1:01:02] she I don't know beating up everybody.
[1:01:05] And then all the women complain. They
[1:01:07] say no no no no
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; she is not a woman.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; We refuse.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; And then they have to change. They have
[1:01:16] to require that the person must be a
[1:01:17] woman from birth.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Well, if you you say I'm a trans man,
[1:01:25] that's fine. Let me bring Mike Tyson
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; and put you there.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Competition. It'll take you to the
[1:01:34] hospital.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; We are different.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Whether you like it or not, we are
[1:01:42] different. We are built different.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; As I'm talking about this, think about
[1:01:46] Christ and you.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; We are built different.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; He is the stronger vessel. We are the
[1:01:52] weaker vessel. Amen.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; He cannot require man to deal with woman
[1:01:58] in a certain way if he himself who is in
[1:02:01] the perfect realization can do it.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; So you see that she's also weaker in her
[1:02:09] spirit
[1:02:11] because she has a tender spirit. Uh
[1:02:14] because uh um tender means here um
[1:02:17] easily distressed,
[1:02:20] readily made uneasy,
[1:02:23] a tender conscious.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; You see there's more advertisement
[1:02:33] and it takes all the ladies in there.
[1:02:37] I was looking at some statistics and
[1:02:40] even product advertised for men.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Over 60% of product advertised for men
[1:02:48] are bought by women.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; If you they take women off the malls,
[1:02:57] business will go down.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; That's true. That's true.
[1:03:02] I agree.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; They are holding the economy.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; If I go to uh Canire, I just go inside.
[1:03:13] 5 minutes I'm out.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; But my wife can go there. Daddy just
[1:03:20] milk. Milk. Okay. She goes for milk.
[1:03:22] She's coming out with so many bags. And
[1:03:24] you say it was just milk. How come you
[1:03:26] have so many bags? You're coming out.
[1:03:28] No, I needed this. We needed this. We
[1:03:30] needed this. We need this. So we are
[1:03:32] built different.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; We don't see the same thing.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; You can tell me look at your head it's
[1:03:40] square.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Your head is square head. Everybody
[1:03:44] don't care whether my head is square or
[1:03:45] round or triangle. As long as I live I'm
[1:03:48] fine. But you go and tell a woman you
[1:03:50] have a square head. She'll spend her
[1:03:51] whole life looking at the mirror. What
[1:03:53] are the four corners of my head?
[1:03:57] Because she has a tender pride. She can
[1:03:59] be broken. She want to be praised. She
[1:04:01] wants something to tell her, "You are
[1:04:02] beautiful. Oh, I love you. You are so
[1:04:04] nice." You know, because they have a
[1:04:06] tender pride, they can be easily broken.
[1:04:08] This is us the bride.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Easily broken.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says that the sacrifice
[1:04:15] that are pleasing unto him is a broken
[1:04:17] heart, a contrite spirit. If you're
[1:04:19] easily broken, you can come out to him
[1:04:22] crying. No.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; You tell a woman, "I love you, she
[1:04:27] cries.
[1:04:29] You say I don't love you, she cries.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; The same way when Jesus come and tells
[1:04:35] me he loves me.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; I can beat my hands out. Oh God, thank
[1:04:39] you Lord. Oh father, I love you. Thank
[1:04:43] you for what you've done for me.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; And he's happy
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; to receive my praises.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; And when I've done something wrong, I'm
[1:04:52] broken in my heart. I cry unto him, "Oh
[1:04:55] God, I'm so sorry. This is me. You are a
[1:04:58] woman brother and sisters.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; The church.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; You know she's not she a woman is made
[1:05:05] in a way when they say she's tender. She
[1:05:08] must be handled with care.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I can tell you there's so
[1:05:14] many things in the Bible we can talk
[1:05:16] about here.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; There are so many things. So she has to
[1:05:19] be handled with care. You can't just do
[1:05:22] whatever you want
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; with her. That's right.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; You must know the Bible say deal with
[1:05:28] her in knowledge.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; In knowledge.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; You just don't I don't care. I don't
[1:05:34] care. No, you have to care.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; You have to care.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; If you don't care, you'll be in trouble.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; This is very important. You know
[1:05:52] the Bible says that man will will answer
[1:05:55] for his wife
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; but not the wife to answer for the man.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; So it puts man in a position of
[1:06:01] responsibility. When he said you are you
[1:06:03] are going to answer that means there are
[1:06:05] some responsibility
[1:06:08] that God is going to look at
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; and if you fail he say you have failed
[1:06:12] to this
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; because you're going to answer.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; So if he can ask that to the man,
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; God himself has to take responsibility
[1:06:23] of his bride.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; He cannot ask a man to do that in a
[1:06:29] partial realization. When he himself in
[1:06:32] a perfect realization, he can't do it
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; because you are here just a shadow
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; of the perfect realization.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; You know, she she she's physically weak,
[1:06:47] not able to endure hardship. So, she
[1:06:50] needs to be shielded from harsh labor
[1:06:53] and the roughness of life.
[1:06:57] That's what Christ
[1:07:00] is doing for you and I.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; So, they are easily broken,
[1:07:07] you know, and they can easily be
[1:07:10] influenced as well.
[1:07:12] The church easily influenced when when
[1:07:15] we're talking about the woman, you look
[1:07:16] at the church as a congregation.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Just to look at the church, you as an
[1:07:20] individual,
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; they all have the same characteristics.
[1:07:24] Easily influenced.
[1:07:27] Why did you buy this? We don't need it.
[1:07:28] It was on sale.
[1:07:31] Does it mean that everything that is on
[1:07:32] sale, we have to buy? Easily influence.
[1:07:35] They 50% of daddy. It was 50% off. I
[1:07:40] just bought it. Oh, but we don't need
[1:07:43] it. But it was 50% off.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; That's the reality of life.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; But you have to deal with them in
[1:07:53] knowledge.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Are you there with me?
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; So men means strong
[1:08:00] strength, ability to fight.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; So when both were together, the devil
[1:08:06] could not do anything.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:09] Amen. But one day the woman went to meet
[1:08:13] the devil without the burly one,
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; without Adam.
[1:08:18] And then she was deceived.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; That's what the church does. When you
[1:08:24] meet the devil
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; without your second Adam,
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; the revealed word,
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; you are going to be defeated.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when you are always staying
[1:08:36] with the second Adam, the revealed word,
[1:08:38] you are bound to victory.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; He's shielding you. He's protecting you.
[1:08:43] But even when she did that and she made
[1:08:46] a mistake, yet Adam as a protector,
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; he stood between judgment and Eve.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; They say, "I give my life for her."
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; I don't know if there are men ready to
[1:09:00] give their life for the wives. I don't
[1:09:01] know. Amen.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; The Bible says
[1:09:05] about the Bible says that men should
[1:09:08] love their wives like Christ loved the
[1:09:10] church and he gave his own life for for
[1:09:12] for for the church. I said, "Brother, I
[1:09:14] have I don't know yet if I'm able to
[1:09:16] give my life for my wife.
[1:09:22] Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God."
[1:09:25] You can see that
[1:09:27] the meat church age.
[1:09:31] Let us go back to the beginning. In the
[1:09:33] original of physical creation as we know
[1:09:35] it today, God made everything in pairs,
[1:09:37] male and female. There was two chickens,
[1:09:40] rooster and hen. There were two cles,
[1:09:42] the cow and the bull. And right down the
[1:09:45] line, but when it came to men, there was
[1:09:47] only one.
[1:09:49] They were not a pair. Adam had been made
[1:09:52] in the image of God. He was a son of
[1:09:54] God. As a son of God, he could not be
[1:09:57] tempted and fall.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; That would be impossible. So God took a
[1:10:03] byproduct of men to cause the fall.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Are you there?
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; When God came to Adam, Adam, Adam, where
[1:10:16] are thou? Oh, I'm hiding. Why we are
[1:10:19] naked? Who told you are naked? is did
[1:10:22] you eat of that food I forbid you to to
[1:10:24] eat? Yes. Why did you do that? The woman
[1:10:27] you gave me.
[1:10:30] God could not debate that. It was not me
[1:10:33] who gave you women. Yeah. Yeah. I'm the
[1:10:34] one. Yeah. Actually,
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; you made all other female different. You
[1:10:38] made her that way.
[1:10:41] And God knew that the purpose was being
[1:10:43] fulfilled.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; It's hard to believe
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; but that's the truth. Amen.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; He came to the woman. Why did you do
[1:10:55] this?
[1:10:57] You made me a weaker vessel.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; With the lust of the eyes, the lust of
[1:11:02] the flesh and the pride of life. I saw
[1:11:05] the the fruit was good for flesh.
[1:11:09] My pleasant to the eyes.
[1:11:12] Increase knowledge. The pride of life.
[1:11:15] You made me thus
[1:11:17] and the devil deceived me. Uh-huh. Okay.
[1:11:22] When he came to the serpent, he didn't
[1:11:25] ask a question.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Why did you do that?"
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "Because you've done that,
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; you are going to be cursed."
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Woman never stepped fresh from the hands
[1:11:41] of God as a true product of God. She was
[1:11:44] produced from men.
[1:11:47] And when God caused her to be brought
[1:11:48] from to bring birth forth from men, she
[1:11:52] was vastly different from the other
[1:11:53] females he had created, she was able to
[1:11:55] be seduced. No other female in creation
[1:11:58] can be immoral, but the human female may
[1:12:00] be touched at almost any time. And that
[1:12:03] weakness in her allows Satan to seduce
[1:12:06] her by way of the serpent and has
[1:12:09] brought the woman to a very peculiar
[1:12:11] position before God and his word. She is
[1:12:14] the type of all things vulgar, foul and
[1:12:17] lossome and the one on on the one hand
[1:12:19] and on the other hand she is the type of
[1:12:22] all things clean and beautiful and holy
[1:12:25] and the respectable of the spirit and
[1:12:27] blessings of God. On the one hand she's
[1:12:29] called the war who is drunk with the
[1:12:32] wine of her fornications. On the other
[1:12:35] she's called the bride of Christ.
[1:12:37] One hand she is the mystery Babylon, the
[1:12:40] abomination before God. On the other
[1:12:42] hand, she's called New Jerusalem, our
[1:12:44] mother. On the one hand, she's called,
[1:12:46] she's so foul and wicked and lwd that
[1:12:49] she's seally cast into the lake of fire
[1:12:52] as the only fit place for her. And on
[1:12:54] the other hand, she's exalted to heaven,
[1:12:56] sharing the very throne of God as the
[1:12:58] only place befitting such a queen.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; Is that wonderful?
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; So God knew that a woman needed
[1:13:08] protection
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; by the burly one.
[1:13:12] So Adam was the image of protection. I
[1:13:14] told you how Adam stood between Eve and
[1:13:17] judgment.
[1:13:19] Not only Adam did that but even Abraham
[1:13:22] when God when uh Sarah laughed and God
[1:13:26] said why did Sarah laugh and then Sarah
[1:13:29] said no I did not. She made God a liar
[1:13:31] and both of them said God could have
[1:13:33] killed Sarah right there.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; But Abraham stood between Sarah and
[1:13:38] judgment. Amen.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; I'm so happy to know that Christ is
[1:13:42] standing between you and judgment.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; He knows that you're a weaker vessel.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; You'll make mistake. You made them
[1:13:51] yesterday. You'll make them today.
[1:13:53] You'll make them tomorrow.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; But it's standing between you and
[1:13:57] judgment.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; And here it says this. Um I I'm just
[1:14:04] going to be very fast so I can get to my
[1:14:06] message. Amen.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; So
[1:14:08] um in the message of marriage and
[1:14:10] divorce said paragraph 110 also there is
[1:14:14] nothing that can be so easily deceived
[1:14:17] as a woman.
[1:14:19] Now the fault proves this statement to
[1:14:21] be true. The fall in the beginning. So
[1:14:24] when they say there's nothing that can
[1:14:26] be easily deceived as a woman. Don't
[1:14:29] look just at the woman in the natural
[1:14:32] even in the spiritual.
[1:14:34] Look at the things that is happening
[1:14:36] today.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; People are so easily deceived. Church
[1:14:39] are easily deceived
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; by all kinds of doctrine and things and
[1:14:45] nonsense.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Easily deceived.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; People believe anything.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; This is the reality.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; This is we women as a church.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; So because she was a victim of
[1:15:04] circumstance, God cannot blame Eve
[1:15:08] for being weak because it was not her
[1:15:12] desire.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; It was not her choice. It was God's own
[1:15:17] choice. It was not your choice to be
[1:15:20] weak. Hallelujah. If you could have
[1:15:23] shaped your life by yourself, you could
[1:15:25] have designed your life the way you want
[1:15:27] to be.
[1:15:29] You could have decided before you were
[1:15:31] born, I want to be born
[1:15:34] this tall,
[1:15:36] this big,
[1:15:38] this way, that way. You can define what
[1:15:42] you want to be. Unfortunately, it's
[1:15:44] beyond your control
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; and you find yourself unable to do
[1:15:49] whatever you can. You are a victim of
[1:15:51] circumstances. But God cannot blame you
[1:15:54] for being a victim of circumstances. You
[1:15:55] know, I used to go and preach in the
[1:15:57] Stony Mountain to the uh uh the inmate
[1:16:00] there and I was telling God will never
[1:16:02] blame you for for being a murderer
[1:16:04] because most of the people I was
[1:16:06] visiting, they were sentenced to life.
[1:16:08] That mean they have taken somebody's
[1:16:09] life. You know, they've been sentenced
[1:16:11] to life and it was very unfortunate. You
[1:16:14] meet people there that have been in
[1:16:15] prison since you you were born.
[1:16:18] They spent like over 50 years in prison,
[1:16:20] 60 years in prison. It it just make you
[1:16:23] feel so bad. And um but I said you know
[1:16:25] what it doesn't matter where you are.
[1:16:27] Salvation is not described by ge
[1:16:29] geography where you are but you can be
[1:16:31] saved here in prison.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; And I said I said whatever you did there
[1:16:35] you were you were a victim of
[1:16:36] circumstances but God has a way provided
[1:16:39] to take you out of those circumstances
[1:16:41] and Christianity is overcoming the
[1:16:43] circumstances of life.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because God has made a way
[1:16:47] of escape.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; God will never condemn you because you
[1:16:50] are a thief.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; God will never condemn you because
[1:16:52] you're a prostitute. But when he has
[1:16:54] provided a way to take you out of
[1:16:56] prostitution and out of theft, then you
[1:16:59] refuse the way provided by God, then God
[1:17:01] will condemn you for that.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; So to refuse to receive him as your
[1:17:07] savior
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; for your the forgiveness of your sin,
[1:17:10] then you have rejected salvation. Then
[1:17:13] you are going to die
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; in your sin.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So when you're a victim of
[1:17:18] circumstances, God doesn't blame you for
[1:17:21] that. But God has provided a way to put
[1:17:25] strength in the weaker vessel.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; He has provided a way to put strength.
[1:17:30] The Bible say in Ephesians chapter 3:1
[1:17:32] 16 verse 21
[1:17:35] verse 16. So Ephesians chapter 3 16 that
[1:17:40] he would grant you according to the
[1:17:42] riches of his glory
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; to be strengthened with might by the
[1:17:47] spirit in the inner man. So God has
[1:17:52] provided a way to strengthen you inside
[1:17:56] to become stronger. Uh and and said that
[1:18:00] the riches of God to strengthen you. It
[1:18:02] comes in the form of a letter by a
[1:18:06] messenger. When you see the message,
[1:18:08] they give you books of the message. It's
[1:18:11] a letter that has the riches of God.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; You have to break it. You have you you
[1:18:17] have to get in and get the riches. Not
[1:18:20] just knowledge of quotes but the riches
[1:18:22] that are in those quotes.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; They are there to give you victory.
[1:18:26] Glory to God. So I'll give you a few
[1:18:29] examples here just for you to understand
[1:18:32] what it means um to be a weaker vessel
[1:18:35] because sometime when you give example
[1:18:37] that people can easily relate.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:40] In the book of Job, I we said it
[1:18:43] yesterday. Uh uh Job chapter 2:9. Um the
[1:18:49] Bible say here, "Then said his wife unto
[1:18:51] him, do thou still retain thy integrity?
[1:18:55] Curse God and die." But he said unto
[1:18:58] her, "Thou speakest as of one of the
[1:19:01] foolish women speaketh. What shall we
[1:19:05] receive? Good at the hand of God, and
[1:19:07] shall we not receive evil? In all this
[1:19:10] did not Job sin with his lips. So you
[1:19:13] can see that Job's wife could not handle
[1:19:19] the hardship they were going through. It
[1:19:21] was too much for her. See, why don't you
[1:19:24] just kiss God and forget about it?
[1:19:27] You know, well, it can happen. Why don't
[1:19:30] you just give give up and forget about
[1:19:33] it?
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; But Job was there to give strength. And
[1:19:37] we're happy to know that Christ is there
[1:19:39] all the time to give us strength.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Even when we ready to do something, it
[1:19:45] just prevent us from not doing it.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; I'm going to take my life. I'm going to
[1:19:49] hold this power line. I want to die. You
[1:19:52] touch the power line. Nothing.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; I want to kill myself.
[1:19:56] Nothing.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; He's still there keeping you.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; You're not keeping yourself. He's the
[1:20:03] one keeping us.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; You're not holding yourself. is the one
[1:20:06] holding you.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; So we see here um coming down here this
[1:20:14] what I was so like today what says in
[1:20:17] the message possessing all things
[1:20:20] and the angel
[1:20:22] with his back turned to the tent said
[1:20:24] where did Sarah laugh and she denied it.
[1:20:29] Now that's telling God to his face that
[1:20:31] he's wrong.
[1:20:33] See that would have took her life but
[1:20:36] God couldn't take Sarah because she was
[1:20:38] part of Abraham.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; See and she was in the covenant with
[1:20:42] him. So she had to go with him and he
[1:20:47] could not take Abraham or take Sarah
[1:20:49] without taking part of Abraham
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; for these two are one.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; And bam continue said a beautiful type
[1:20:56] of us today.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. unworthy
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; worthy of death when we sin. But God
[1:21:05] cannot kill us
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; because he will we are part of Christ.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; That's our grace. Amazing grace.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Because we are in union with Christ.
[1:21:17] Isn't that beautiful thought? Union with
[1:21:20] Christ. So therefore, our sins when we
[1:21:22] do them, we ought to quickly confess
[1:21:25] them that they are wrong because God
[1:21:28] would take our life. But the blood
[1:21:31] answers in our place and God just can't
[1:21:33] cross that blood. He just can't do it
[1:21:36] because it's a promise that won't do it.
[1:21:38] So he can't break his own promise.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Being a weaker vessel, God can't tell
[1:21:47] you everything.
[1:21:49] You can't tell your wife everything.
[1:21:53] Somebody say amen.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; I I haven't heard a lot of amen here.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Some people they make their wives a
[1:22:02] dumping station
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; where they bring all their frustration,
[1:22:06] everything and all the everything they
[1:22:09] go through in their life just dump and
[1:22:11] dump and dump. You need to protect her.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; She needs to be protected.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Listen here. I'll give you an example.
[1:22:20] Say when God spoke to Abraham,
[1:22:24] he said, I can imagine it was on a
[1:22:26] Sunday afternoon after he spoke to him
[1:22:29] maybe
[1:22:31] on Monday. How is he going to do it? He
[1:22:34] said, take thy son Isaac and go and
[1:22:38] offer him in sacrifice. Burnt sacrifice,
[1:22:42] burnt offering. So po Isaac, he looks at
[1:22:46] him. gave me image. It was the only son
[1:22:48] that Sarah had. She waited for so long.
[1:22:53] Baby Isaac, oh, you're so cute. I love
[1:22:56] you. Come to mommy. Stay here. You come
[1:22:59] and say here, Sarah.
[1:23:02] God spoke to me.
[1:23:05] What?
[1:23:07] What?
[1:23:09] Relax, relax, relax, sir. He God said we
[1:23:13] should offer Isaac,
[1:23:16] kill him, burn. What?
[1:23:18] And when you going to do it? Tomorrow.
[1:23:21] Okay. I think by the time they wake up
[1:23:23] in the morning, Sarah and Isaac would
[1:23:27] have disappeared already in the house.
[1:23:34] But I'm say here, he loves him. But I
[1:23:37] can't look at that. I got to think of
[1:23:40] obeying God. So he couldn't tell Sarah
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; because you know the ladies are the
[1:23:46] weaker vessel.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; So you sometime you have to watch. I
[1:23:52] can't tell Sarah because she wouldn't
[1:23:55] understand.
[1:23:56] God cannot tell you everything you can't
[1:23:58] understand.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; You are a weaker vessel. God cannot tell
[1:24:04] you know when you get married your
[1:24:06] children will have such issues. Your
[1:24:08] husband will be like this in 10 years or
[1:24:10] in 25 years. Then what you going to do?
[1:24:12] You say, "Oh, if this the case, I'm
[1:24:14] taking a different route."
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; But he wants you to walk by faith.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; You you are walking
[1:24:24] in into the unknown.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; You don't know what the future hold.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; You say, "I know the maker of the rain."
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; I know who holds the future.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He holds tomorrow.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; I'm concerned about today. Tomorrow will
[1:24:45] take care of itself.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; God doesn't give you those details.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the time God called uh
[1:24:54] called Abraham?
[1:24:56] Who knew that Israel will go through
[1:24:58] everything that they went through today?
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; But they've never lost the covenant.
[1:25:03] They may have lost some joy, some
[1:25:06] battles, but they are still loved of
[1:25:08] God.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; You may lose some joy. You may lose some
[1:25:13] battles, but you are still beloved of
[1:25:15] the father.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; The covenant is still there.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; And what say here in Job? Sarah never
[1:25:25] was too strong anyhow in the faith
[1:25:29] because she lacked she disbelieved the
[1:25:31] promise. But Abraham held her because
[1:25:36] the man and the woman are one.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; I'm so happy to know today that it's not
[1:25:42] my faith. He knows that I'm weak.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; He knows that I'm going to fail. But he
[1:25:48] brings in his own faith.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; He brings in his own virtue. He brings
[1:25:52] in his own patience. He brings in his
[1:25:54] own temperance. He brings in his own
[1:25:56] godliness. He brings in his own
[1:25:58] brotherly kindness and his own love to
[1:26:01] put strength in me
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; because I'm weak.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; He knows that there's nothing in me to
[1:26:07] overcome. He said without me you can't
[1:26:09] do nothing.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; I am the vine. You are the branches.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Life must come from me divine for you to
[1:26:15] bring forth fruits.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Otherwise you'll never do anything good.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; I'm a weaker vessel.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; That's that's why I like the song. I am
[1:26:24] weak but thou are strong.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Jesus keep me from all wrong.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; But you see,
[1:26:34] there was another woman in the Bible
[1:26:37] whose husband was supposed to protect,
[1:26:40] but he did not protect. That was Ahab.
[1:26:44] His wife Jezebel
[1:26:47] loved loved him so much.
[1:26:51] But Ahab
[1:26:53] saw the field of Nebat.
[1:26:56] He said, "Oh, he asked neighbor, can you
[1:26:58] give me your field? I want to buy your
[1:27:00] field." I said, "No, this is the
[1:27:02] inheritance of our family."
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; You know the laws of inheritance
[1:27:08] to give it to you. That means it's old
[1:27:10] generations,
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; they're going to be deprived,
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; so I can't do that. And Ahab was
[1:27:18] frustrated. The Bible say he went home.
[1:27:21] He refused to eat.
[1:27:24] He was in the bed turning
[1:27:27] and she did it. Then Jesus became
[1:27:29] sweetheart
[1:27:31] are you okay? No. What's wrong
[1:27:36] but what did you do? You refused to sell
[1:27:40] me feel. Uhhuh. Aren't you the king of
[1:27:44] Israel? I'll take care of it.
[1:27:48] And what did she do? She killed Nebot.
[1:27:51] And when the prophet came, he said,
[1:27:52] "Ahab, you have killed neighbor."
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; If he would have protect his wife
[1:28:00] knowing she's a wicked vessel,
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; huh? You tell her everything that
[1:28:05] brother told me this, that brother said
[1:28:06] this about me, this one, this, this, the
[1:28:08] next time that person comes home, no
[1:28:11] juice,
[1:28:16] no water.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; No coffee.
[1:28:20] Who's responsible?
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; You.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Because you go and tell her everything.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; You thinking you think she had the same
[1:28:30] strength like you.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; So God cannot come tell you everything
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; because he knows that you don't have the
[1:28:38] same strength like him.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; That reason he can just keep you walking
[1:28:43] by faith.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Walking by faith.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Walking by faith. Amen.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; So he said now
[1:28:56] here
[1:29:00] um
[1:29:02] in the me in the sarra church age
[1:29:04] because as we read he said you must
[1:29:06] dwell with them in knowledge.
[1:29:11] So when a man lives with a woman,
[1:29:15] you know, you might say, "Will my wife
[1:29:17] is she's in my hands like this. I know
[1:29:20] how to make her happy. I know how to
[1:29:22] calm it down. I know how I know. I know.
[1:29:24] I know. I know. I know. When she's
[1:29:27] unhappy, I know I know how to fix it.
[1:29:33] When she's she she's happy, I know what
[1:29:36] can make her happy.
[1:29:39] And if I go out, I bring a gift, she'll
[1:29:41] be very happy. And you know you can do
[1:29:44] it. If you refuse to do it and I'm not
[1:29:47] going to do it, no, no, no, no. There's
[1:29:48] something wrong.
[1:29:51] A man should know because the Bible said
[1:29:53] you should deal with the woman in
[1:29:56] knowledge.
[1:29:59] Like Christ, he stands in the midst of
[1:30:02] the seven church ages.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; He say, I know.
[1:30:07] I know. I know your trials. I know your
[1:30:10] problems. I appreciate you when you do
[1:30:12] this. I appreciate when you do that.
[1:30:14] Even the way he's talking to the church,
[1:30:17] even when he has to blame the church, he
[1:30:19] start by appreciating them for the good
[1:30:20] works. I appreciate them then. But I
[1:30:23] have something against me when you do
[1:30:24] like that.
[1:30:26] You know, one day these are things that
[1:30:28] happened when we I had just get married.
[1:30:30] We're there by one year of marriage or
[1:30:32] something. something happened between my
[1:30:34] wife and then I was was uh upset and I
[1:30:36] was happy and I said I'm not going to
[1:30:39] eat
[1:30:41] you know men they have those kind of a
[1:30:43] behaviors you know is that true
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; is that true
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; brother is that true
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; you don't want to answer that's fine
[1:30:54] I say I don't want to eat
[1:30:59] now if you say you don't want to eat
[1:31:02] make sure You don't eat.
[1:31:08] Don't stop at Morton or at McDonald's or
[1:31:12] anywhere. Then when you come home, you
[1:31:14] change your face. I'm not eating.
[1:31:18] If you say you're not eating, don't eat.
[1:31:24] So
[1:31:26] you say I'm not eating and then oh I
[1:31:29] think long time I haven't seen this
[1:31:31] brother. Let me go and see. Oh brother,
[1:31:32] how you doing? Let's go and have a
[1:31:34] coffee. You go but you know you are
[1:31:36] going for coffee or something because
[1:31:37] you don't want to eat at home and when
[1:31:39] you come back home you change your face
[1:31:41] become serious because you want to
[1:31:43] maintain the atmosphere and that's
[1:31:46] happened to me and then as I was going
[1:31:49] out like I was talking to somebody
[1:31:52] speaking to my heart
[1:31:54] why aren't you eating? I said because
[1:31:56] I'm disappointed
[1:31:58] I said you're disappointed with who?
[1:32:01] with food or with your wife?
[1:32:05] I said disappointed with my my wife. So
[1:32:08] you have any problem with the food? I
[1:32:10] said no. See, eat food. I'm telling the
[1:32:14] truth, brother.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; One thing I want to tell you, I believe
[1:32:17] that God speaks today.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Because we have our our our mindset is
[1:32:25] so polluted with the spirit of the age.
[1:32:28] Even Hollywood has polluted our mind
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; because they gave all the they make
[1:32:33] movies of uh of uh of all Bible
[1:32:36] characters.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; And when you see the movie of Abraham,
[1:32:40] they tell you how God was Abraham,
[1:32:42] Abraham, take thy only begotten son and
[1:32:45] going to sacrifice him. And people knew
[1:32:48] that God spoke to Abraham with an
[1:32:50] audible voice. But the prophet say God
[1:32:52] spoke to his heart.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; It was still small voice. trust me
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; asking him to go and sacrifice
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; in the third pool there are there small
[1:33:02] voice there too
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; and that's the small voice you don't
[1:33:06] need to be filled with the Holy Ghost to
[1:33:08] hear it
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; because what I'm saying whether you are
[1:33:11] a believer or not God speaks to
[1:33:12] everybody
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; sometimes people think it's their own
[1:33:15] conscience you know sometimes you can be
[1:33:17] there something just tell you move this
[1:33:19] glass from here
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; and you neglect it then you did a
[1:33:22] mistake it fell on the floor or oh boy
[1:33:25] something told me to remove it. What is
[1:33:27] that thing that warns you?
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; God speaks all the time. But there it
[1:33:32] says it's still small voice,
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; but we are so overwhelmed by other
[1:33:36] voices and other things that we are
[1:33:39] unable to listen to God. But God still
[1:33:42] speaks today.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; I I I believe he still speaks. If he can
[1:33:47] speak to the unbelievers, how much more
[1:33:50] do his own children?
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; If you can just stay quiet and listen to
[1:33:55] him, he will speak to you.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; What Bible said, before you do any
[1:33:59] wrong, God has to warn you.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; But many time people don't yield to the
[1:34:03] warning of God.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; They get mad want to do something, but
[1:34:07] God spoke to me. You a Christian, just
[1:34:09] leave it alone. Oh no, I got to tell
[1:34:11] them. They got to know. And then you
[1:34:13] move on. But God did speak to you.
[1:34:16] Hallelujah.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; So God spoke to me that day. You know,
[1:34:19] one day I was driving. I was in um it
[1:34:22] was winter and it was it was dark. I was
[1:34:25] by myself
[1:34:27] and um it was a um on a highway, but
[1:34:32] because the the words were not really
[1:34:35] good and it was there was a it's not a
[1:34:38] blizzard, but it was snowing and uh
[1:34:42] something I was just by myself in the
[1:34:43] car. Something spoke to my heart. Slow
[1:34:46] down.
[1:34:48] I said, "Slow down. I'm by myself.
[1:34:51] Slow down." I didn't. I continue on.
[1:34:54] Slow down. I slowed down. I slowed down
[1:34:59] without knowing why. And I started
[1:35:02] looking around and just as I was slowing
[1:35:05] down completely down, I saw a big herds
[1:35:08] of deers
[1:35:12] crossing before me like that.
[1:35:15] in the whole village.
[1:35:18] I say, "Oh, God, thank you." But God
[1:35:20] spoke to me.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; God speaks.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; He has spoken to you many times.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Don't say God never spoken to you.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; In every situation, he speaks.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; But the only thing is people don't take
[1:35:34] time to listen.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; When somebody come to see pastor, pastor
[1:35:38] this situation say what did God tell
[1:35:40] you?
[1:35:42] anything anything that come to your mind
[1:35:43] anything no thinking of this or but
[1:35:45] right there God spoken to you this is
[1:35:47] the word
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; I can't tell you more than that
[1:35:51] amen
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; so God speaks so when he spoke and I say
[1:35:56] since that time
[1:35:59] I always eat food
[1:36:05] there's nothing such as don't eat food
[1:36:06] anymore
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:36:10] So
[1:36:12] God bless you.
[1:36:15] He said here now the Lord God Almighty
[1:36:19] says I know
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; you think God doesn't know you.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; You think he doesn't know your problems?
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; He said he asked the man to deal with
[1:36:29] the woman in knowledge. You must know
[1:36:32] everything she's going through.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:37] But even says where she going through a
[1:36:39] menopause, how you should you should uh
[1:36:41] deal with her and you know and how many
[1:36:45] he has given so many advices how we
[1:36:48] should take care of our wives
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; because many times in the message
[1:36:54] people try to focus on women women
[1:36:59] but they don't talk much about men.
[1:37:04] They don't talk much about men, but men
[1:37:06] are the problem too.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Because if a man is really established
[1:37:14] in the scriptures,
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; she he is going to stabilize the wife
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; because he has the fear of God in his
[1:37:22] heart.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; He knows what God is expecting of him as
[1:37:26] a man. Amen.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; And if we a man stand at the place of
[1:37:32] Christ for his wife,
[1:37:35] his wife would say, "God has given me a
[1:37:38] man after my own heart."
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; I'm telling the truth
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; because you realize as the head, you are
[1:37:47] actually a servant.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; The Bible say he that want to be big,
[1:37:52] let him be a servant. That's right.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; If you cannot serve, you're not ready
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; for marriage.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm I'm I'm the head. Man is the
[1:38:04] head. What does it mean is the head?
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; Who gave you that authority?
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; He that gave you authority, do you have
[1:38:12] authority above him?
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; No. God never given anyone authority
[1:38:18] without measure, without limit. Nobody.
[1:38:22] Even the sun has much power
[1:38:26] but respect God's law.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; If it comes just closer we all burnt.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; It doesn't further we all frozen.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; The moon lots of power
[1:38:40] but respect God's word. The power is
[1:38:43] controlled by the perimeter of God's
[1:38:46] laws. God's word. Amen.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Even a police officer,
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; if he has authority to stop a car, a big
[1:38:53] truck, a semi-truck, or to arrest you,
[1:38:56] his his authority is bound by the
[1:38:59] constitution.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; So if he goes beyond that,
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; he can be sued and put in jail and
[1:39:06] arrested.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; He when somebody is is using power over
[1:39:13] the limit
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; that is given out to him, they call him
[1:39:16] a dictator. Amen.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; An abuser
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; is abusing power.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; So God can even even the church when
[1:39:24] they say the pastor he he has full
[1:39:26] authority. It has limitation. It's
[1:39:29] controlled by the word.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Even when they say parents you have to
[1:39:36] the children need to obey to their
[1:39:38] parent. The Bible say parent make sure
[1:39:40] you don't uh uh anger your children.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; There are limitation in everything. God
[1:39:46] cannot give you authority without
[1:39:47] measure.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; But how many people know the limitation,
[1:39:51] the perimeter of the authority?
[1:39:53] If you know it, then you know who you
[1:39:56] are.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; If you don't know it, you can be an
[1:39:58] abuser.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; You're abusing authority.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Huh? But if you stay in a position of a
[1:40:06] real man,
[1:40:10] the wife,
[1:40:12] she has no other church. She's going to
[1:40:14] praise her husband.
[1:40:18] Hallelujah.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; One time I was preaching a denomination
[1:40:22] church in Winnipeg,
[1:40:25] they asked me this question, what do we
[1:40:27] do? Because it was we have a lot of
[1:40:28] people that came like immigrants and
[1:40:30] said, "What do we do? We have a uh uh
[1:40:33] women, wives when they come here,
[1:40:36] they take all the child tax benefit
[1:40:38] money. They don't share with their
[1:40:39] husband. How can we handle this?" I told
[1:40:42] him, I said, "Go on your knees, pray for
[1:40:45] them, for God to deliver them from
[1:40:46] selfishness." Everybody start laughing.
[1:40:51] But if you're a Christian, you know how
[1:40:53] to fight.
[1:40:54] Use
[1:40:56] the means that God has given you to
[1:40:58] fight.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; People don't spend much time on their
[1:41:02] knees to pray for one another anymore.
[1:41:05] It debate and debate and argument and
[1:41:08] things but nobody takes time to stay in
[1:41:10] prayer for mercy. Lord, do something for
[1:41:12] this man. Do something for my husband.
[1:41:14] You gave me this man. Oh God, I'm
[1:41:16] claiming me under the blood. Deliver
[1:41:18] him. Oh, father God.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Like Rebecca in the Bible was praying
[1:41:22] for uh uh Zakias
[1:41:26] to know the message of the hour
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; and God changed the man and he believed
[1:41:31] the word.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; But you don't see those kind of people
[1:41:35] anymore. But how how do you say you love
[1:41:37] a person when you can't take care of
[1:41:38] their soul and taking care of their
[1:41:40] soul, you have to make a sacrifice the
[1:41:42] behavior that you don't like, God can
[1:41:44] change it.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; But unless you see you're no longer a
[1:41:47] Christian, you don't believe that God
[1:41:48] can do it.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; But we believe in the supernatural.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; And when you pray, don't expect the
[1:41:53] result today.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Have faith in God.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Even if after you pray the things happen
[1:42:00] tomorrow, say, "Lord, I've already
[1:42:01] prayed. I committed in your hands. Take
[1:42:03] care of it. God will do it.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; You got to come out with a testimony.
[1:42:07] Lord, thank you.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; In this age, I have overcome.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Not by might, not by power, but by
[1:42:14] Christ.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I know.
[1:42:21] I know.
[1:42:24] There he is walking in the midst of his
[1:42:26] people.
[1:42:28] There he is, the chief shepherd of the
[1:42:31] flock.
[1:42:33] But does he hold back the persecution?
[1:42:38] Does he stem the tribulation?
[1:42:41] No, he does not. He simply says, "I know
[1:42:44] your tribulation. I know your
[1:42:47] challenges. I know your problems.
[1:42:51] I'm not at all unmindful of your
[1:42:54] suffering."
[1:42:56] But said, "What a stumbling block to
[1:42:58] this is to many people
[1:43:02] like Israel. They wonder if God really
[1:43:04] loves them. How can God be just and
[1:43:07] loving if he stand by and watches his
[1:43:10] people suffer?"
[1:43:14] That is they ask in Malachi 1:3,
[1:43:18] the better of the word of the Lord to
[1:43:19] Israel by Malachi.
[1:43:22] I have loved you, said the Lord. Yet we
[1:43:26] say, where is thou hast loved us? Was
[1:43:29] not Esau, Jacob, brother? Said the Lord.
[1:43:31] Yet I love Jacob. I hated Esau and laid
[1:43:34] his mountains and his heritage waste for
[1:43:36] the dragons of the wilderness. He said,
[1:43:38] you see, they could not figure out God's
[1:43:41] love.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; They thought that love meant no
[1:43:44] suffering.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; They thought that love meant a baby with
[1:43:47] parental care. But God said that his
[1:43:50] love was elective love. The proof of his
[1:43:53] love is election. That no matter what
[1:43:55] happened, his love was proven truly by
[1:43:57] the fact that they were chosen unto
[1:43:59] salvation.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; God did not choose you in time. It
[1:44:03] before the foundation of the world.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; The bottom say he know he knows you the
[1:44:08] way he knew you before the foundation of
[1:44:10] the world.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; And he may commit you to death as he did
[1:44:16] Paul. He may commit you to suffering as
[1:44:19] he did Job. That is his prerogative.
[1:44:21] He's sovereign, but he's still all with
[1:44:25] purpose.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; If he did not have a purpose,
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; then he would be the author of
[1:44:30] frustration and not of peace.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; His purpose is that after we have
[1:44:35] suffered a while, we will be made
[1:44:38] perfect,
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; be established, strengthened, and
[1:44:42] settled.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; He's the one who knows how to make you
[1:44:45] perfect. Amen.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; It's not perfection according to your
[1:44:49] eyes.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; I was saying yesterday, I said, can you
[1:44:52] imagine the same God who protected
[1:44:57] uh uh uh Daniel in the lion's den, he
[1:45:01] closed the mouth of the lions.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; The same God who protected the Hebrews
[1:45:09] children from the fire.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:13] The same God in the church ages you
[1:45:17] could see the saints being fed to tigers
[1:45:21] and lions
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; and he never done anything
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; but they are overcomers
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; so the way
[1:45:30] the overcomer is looked is not the way
[1:45:34] you look at the overcomers. You would
[1:45:36] think oh God has delivered Daniel he's
[1:45:39] going to deliver me. No, for you
[1:45:41] tonight. The de the lion is going to eat
[1:45:43] you.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Oh no, they're going to burn me. Oh, he
[1:45:51] has saved Shadrach, Mesha, Abednego. I'm
[1:45:55] going to stand up. This fire is not
[1:45:56] going to burn me. You are going to be
[1:45:58] burned.
[1:46:00] But that was what God was doing at that
[1:46:01] time.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we I'm so thankful
[1:46:06] because Bam said at the opening of the
[1:46:08] seventh seal, God will be known,
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; his ways,
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; who he is, how he does things, that you,
[1:46:16] his children, you may not be in
[1:46:18] confusion.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. It say in plain language,
[1:46:26] the very character of Jesus Christ was
[1:46:28] perfected by suffering.
[1:46:31] I'll just go here something before I I
[1:46:34] go to my last uh part here that I'm
[1:46:37] going to finish.
[1:46:40] He said in the message church age. Now
[1:46:43] this special condition in Simra must be
[1:46:46] applied to every age
[1:46:50] said there is no age free from it.
[1:46:54] There is no true believer free from it.
[1:46:58] This is of God. This is the will of God.
[1:47:02] It is needful. We need the Lord to teach
[1:47:06] us the truth that we are to suffer and
[1:47:09] be Christlike in doing it.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; No matter the Bible say that count it as
[1:47:18] a joy all the trials and everything you
[1:47:20] go through, he knows that you're a
[1:47:22] weaker vessel. He has to protect you.
[1:47:24] Don't think he's dealing with you
[1:47:25] without knowledge. He knows. I know what
[1:47:28] you go through. I know your problem. Is
[1:47:31] he taking it away? May he doesn't take
[1:47:32] it away. He knows what he's doing. He
[1:47:34] has a purpose. If he's not doing for a
[1:47:36] purpose, then he's the author of
[1:47:38] frustration.
[1:47:41] In every church age, look at the John to
[1:47:45] the seventh church age. He said, "Peace
[1:47:47] and grace be upon you."
[1:47:51] Is it taking away problems? No.
[1:47:55] the church that was the the with the the
[1:48:00] Christian um um persecution and
[1:48:02] everything but it said peacemen.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; And
[1:48:11] grace
[1:48:13] be upon you.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; He say I will give you peace not the way
[1:48:17] the world give peace. You may go through
[1:48:20] problems, challenges, but you have peace
[1:48:22] with God.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And even Paul,
[1:48:28] all the epistles,
[1:48:30] grace and peace.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Grace and peace.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Grace and peace. It doesn't mean that
[1:48:35] there's no problem.
[1:48:37] Even to the correction, grace and peace.
[1:48:39] But it was the troubled church. many
[1:48:41] problems, division, separation. One has
[1:48:45] taken his father's wife, a different
[1:48:46] things, competition, a gift and
[1:48:48] everyone, everybody want to speak with
[1:48:50] tongues. But say grace and peace be upon
[1:48:53] you.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Grace and peace be upon you each one of
[1:48:58] you.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; It does not mean that I'm going to take
[1:49:01] away the challenges of life. But you see
[1:49:04] that he that endureth to the end,
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; say the quitter never wins. And the
[1:49:10] winners never quit.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; But God has a way of doing it.
[1:49:17] He told Abraham here in Genesis chapter
[1:49:20] 17 verse one. And when Abraham was 90
[1:49:24] years old and nine, the Lord appeared to
[1:49:26] him and said unto him, I am the Almighty
[1:49:29] God and walk before me and be thou
[1:49:31] perfect.
[1:49:33] In the message El Sharam said, and God
[1:49:35] appeared to him again. And when he
[1:49:37] appeared to him this time he appeared to
[1:49:39] him in the name of almighty God. The
[1:49:42] Hebrew word there is is El Shia which
[1:49:45] means L means God the strong one.
[1:49:49] Hallelujah.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; From Genesis 3 the strong one. L God the
[1:49:55] lifegiver. Shadi Shad. Shad mean breast
[1:50:00] like the woman. Shadi means breasted
[1:50:02] plural. And God appeared to Abraham in
[1:50:04] the name of the strong breasted one.
[1:50:10] What to what a thing to appear to an old
[1:50:13] man aund years old. His body as good as
[1:50:17] dead after he had made him a promise
[1:50:19] that he was going to have a baby with
[1:50:21] his wife Sarah and her 90. Think of it.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So Abraham,
[1:50:27] he was already weak in his body, but El
[1:50:31] Shadia,
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; he gave strength to the body.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; It doesn't only give strength to the
[1:50:36] body, even to your spirit.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Because he's the braces God.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Weaknesses of the flesh and weaknesses
[1:50:44] of the spirit, he gives strength.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; I am the Lord God that health thee from
[1:50:50] all thy disease and forgiveth all thy
[1:50:52] iniquities. We used to sing I am the
[1:50:55] Lord that he
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; I am the Lord that save my soul that
[1:51:00] save your soul. So he I will love this.
[1:51:03] I'm going to finish with this. So in
[1:51:05] every station of Abraham he has been
[1:51:07] strengthened by God. Maybe you don't see
[1:51:10] it but God is giving you strength.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; God is fighting for you in a way that
[1:51:16] you don't see.
[1:51:19] He said here in the message question and
[1:51:22] answers of 1964 it's exactly with Luther
[1:51:24] Wesley and down to here just exactly how
[1:51:27] he has dealt with the churches like he
[1:51:28] did with Abraham God is dealing with the
[1:51:31] churches he's dealing with you as he did
[1:51:33] with Abraham
[1:51:35] how he appeared how that there when he
[1:51:38] confirmed the covenant to him under the
[1:51:39] shed blood it was Philadelphia age yes
[1:51:43] sir that was the blood age Luther the
[1:51:45] western age but the when the we watch
[1:51:47] the pentecost also age after he come to
[1:51:49] there he made the promise to of El Shari
[1:51:54] nurse from me the question is can you
[1:51:57] nurse
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; h
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; can you nurse can you take strength from
[1:52:02] me are you ready to nurse for me and
[1:52:05] take strength or you don't want because
[1:52:08] I'm willing to give you strength
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; come to me I'm shar
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; you are tired
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; you have lost hope your body is is
[1:52:17] completely weak but I'm El Sharia.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; That was brought before the
[1:52:26] Pentecostals. You see, can you nurse?
[1:52:29] But they didn't do it. They grabbed a
[1:52:31] breast from the denomination when they
[1:52:33] were come out. But the seed, real seed
[1:52:36] come on to nurse that breast. Are you
[1:52:38] the real seed?
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; El Shadia. Now what promise? Abraham,
[1:52:44] you are old. Your strength is gone.
[1:52:48] And for the last 25 years, you've
[1:52:51] trusted me. Hallelujah.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; For the last 25 years, you have trusted
[1:52:56] me. Since you came to the message, for
[1:52:59] all this time, since I gave you the
[1:53:01] promise, you have trusted me. You
[1:53:03] believed me. So many things happens, ups
[1:53:06] and down, but you did not give up.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; You stayed with me. I'm so happy.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You trusted me. But now I
[1:53:16] want to tell you what my name is. My
[1:53:18] name is the breasted one. The strong one
[1:53:22] and breasted God. Now watch. Not a
[1:53:24] breast God, but breasted both for the
[1:53:28] spirit and body. Wounded for
[1:53:30] transgression and with his stripes we
[1:53:33] were healed.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; The breasted one, the strong one, the
[1:53:36] strength giver.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Is here tonight. this morning, right now
[1:53:42] he's here,
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; giving you strength.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; Do you want to take his breast
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; and get some strength or you don't want?
[1:53:49] He said the believer
[1:53:52] nursing from the word, the breasted one,
[1:53:55] the new testament and the old testament
[1:53:58] nursing from God promises.
[1:54:01] That's where you draw your strength.
[1:54:02] Amen.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; When God has given us the word and it
[1:54:06] takes God promise of healing, salvation,
[1:54:08] whatever it is, he's laying on the bosom
[1:54:11] of God just as satisfied as it can be.
[1:54:14] Glory to God. And he said, Abraham, you
[1:54:18] are old. Your strength is gone. Your
[1:54:21] arms are withered up. Your men, God, but
[1:54:26] I am your mother.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:29] God said to Abraham, Abraham, I am your
[1:54:32] mother. God present himself to Abraham
[1:54:34] as the mother. I am your mother just
[1:54:38] take a hold of my promise and be
[1:54:40] satisfied. While you are waiting, be
[1:54:42] rested. Now, that's the way every
[1:54:44] believer.
[1:54:46] No matter how bad the cancers got you,
[1:54:50] how long you've been sitting in a
[1:54:51] wheelchair, any of those things, just if
[1:54:54] you can grasp that revelation from God,
[1:54:56] then be satisfied knowing that is going
[1:54:58] to happen because faith waits patiently
[1:55:01] for the promise.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; One time I preached this message was a
[1:55:06] sister had cancer. I didn't know that.
[1:55:08] She came to the prayer line. She said,
[1:55:10] "Lord, you are the strength giver." It
[1:55:12] was her faith.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; I didn't know, but she believed. Amen.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; She came and God healed her.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; We had a sister in our church that she
[1:55:23] had a
[1:55:26] uterus uh um cancer and it was so bad
[1:55:29] and she went through so many
[1:55:30] chemotherapy and so many things. It came
[1:55:33] to the time they say she's going to say
[1:55:34] well she's she's dying and you know I I
[1:55:37] said Lord I was just walking walking in
[1:55:40] my room praying Lord no I was in a
[1:55:43] different state. I decided I took her to
[1:55:46] church and uh her son, my wife, I said,
[1:55:49] "Let's go and pray to God all night."
[1:55:52] She was very weak. I said, "But just
[1:55:53] stay in the couch. We're going to pray."
[1:55:56] And for some reason, I just said, I say,
[1:55:59] "You know, there are things you say in
[1:56:00] prayer and under the anoint, you don't
[1:56:02] know what you're saying." I said,
[1:56:04] "You'll be a testimony
[1:56:09] of God's grace."
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then it was so bad. She was in
[1:56:17] pain every day. You know, I can't just
[1:56:21] give much details, but people know what
[1:56:24] it means. She was suffering at a level I
[1:56:30] can't just describe. But I told her, I
[1:56:32] said, "Sister, no matter how you feel,
[1:56:35] keep coming to church."
[1:56:37] She'll come to church. She come just sit
[1:56:39] there. The toilet is right beside you
[1:56:41] here. anything just go and come back
[1:56:45] and they did the chemotherapy the
[1:56:47] radiation and they done um biopsy they
[1:56:51] say wow when we went to the hospital
[1:56:53] they said no cancer is still there I
[1:56:56] just give I say you know you see those
[1:56:58] thoughts of healings
[1:57:00] just repeat them over and over and over
[1:57:03] repeat them over and over the more you
[1:57:04] repeat it the more you believe it more
[1:57:06] you believe it the more you repeat it
[1:57:07] the more you repeat it the more you
[1:57:08] believe it and and one day your body is
[1:57:10] going to obey to your profession. I
[1:57:12] said, "Repeat those words. Repeat,
[1:57:14] repeat your the healing." She kept on
[1:57:16] repeating and repeating and repeating. I
[1:57:18] went to the doctor and they said, "Oh,
[1:57:20] we have to sign a document here because
[1:57:22] uh uh we I I told him I said, "What if
[1:57:25] it's everything changes? What? Oh, it
[1:57:28] won't change. We are 99% convinced that
[1:57:33] it won't work."
[1:57:35] We said that's fine. So they did the
[1:57:36] biopsy two times and then they called
[1:57:41] they said you know what there's no more
[1:57:43] cancer in her body.
[1:57:46] [Applause]
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; The sister who was unable to walk she's
[1:57:50] not walking
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; unable to eat. She's not eating.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; She's doing everything normal now
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; than what it used to before.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; It is El Sharia.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not going to take those
[1:58:06] things away,
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; but he want to reveal his attribute
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; through our weaknesses.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; How many are we this morning?
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; How many can say, "Lord, I'm weak,
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; but thou are strong.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; I've come to you, El Shad.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Lord, give me strength. I can't keep on
[1:58:22] going without you. I can't even make one
[1:58:25] step. I can't even walk without you,
[1:58:28] Lord, holding my hands." Let us stand
[1:58:31] and just speak it in your own own words
[1:58:33] and tell him Lord give me strength as
[1:58:36] the pastor comes.
[1:58:58] [Music]
[1:59:08] I'm weak but thou strong.
[1:59:18] I am weak but thou art strong.
[1:59:26] Jesus
[1:59:28] keep me from all
[1:59:36] be sisfied
[1:59:38] as long
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; as the walk. As we walk close to thee,
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; just
[1:59:52] a closer walk with me.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, granted
[2:00:01] Jesus is my plea.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, daily
[2:00:09] walking close to thee.
[2:00:13] Oh, let it be,
[2:00:16] dear Lord. Let it be.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; Let's sing verse one once again. Oh
[2:00:22] Lord, I
[2:00:24] am weak, but thou are strong.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[2:00:33] keep me from all.
[2:00:39] I'll be sisified as long
[2:00:46] as I walk. Let me walk close to thee.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:00:55] just a closer walk with thee.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; Is that your desire this afternoon?
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; Granted,
[2:01:04] Jesus is my plea.
[2:01:10] Oh, daily
[2:01:12] walking close to thee.
[2:01:17] Oh, let it be,
[2:01:20] dear Lord. Let it be
[2:01:24] for this world.
[2:01:26] Oh, through
[2:01:28] this world of toils and stairs.
[2:01:34] If I falter, Lord, who cares?
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; Who
[2:01:43] with me my burden shares?
[2:01:48] Oh, none but thee,
[2:01:51] dear Lord. None but thee.
[2:01:55] Just a closer
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; just a closer walk with me.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Closer walk with me.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Granted
[2:02:07] Jesus is my plea.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; Daily
[2:02:15] walking close to thee.
[2:02:20] Let it be,
[2:02:22] dear Lord. Let it be.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Did you love the message this morning?
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; Let's give a hand to the Lord.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[2:02:35] [Music]
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; Pastor Boris has a way to bring the
[2:02:44] message that is just so nice.
[2:02:48] He knows how to go and then just filter
[2:02:50] and then come to the level where we are.
[2:02:53] Oh, thank God for that. Thank God for
[2:02:55] that.
[2:02:57] Sometimes we want to be too strong.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; But you know when when we are strong
[2:03:03] when we think we are strong when we
[2:03:05] think we are strong we can handle things
[2:03:07] ourselves
[2:03:09] that's where we fail. Amen.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; When Eve thought that she she she she
[2:03:14] had the greater revelation than Adam
[2:03:17] that she has figured things out on her
[2:03:19] own. That's where she failed. When the
[2:03:22] church think that can live by itself
[2:03:25] without God, that's where we fail. When
[2:03:27] we leave the word of God, that's when
[2:03:29] you fail. But when you recognize, Lord,
[2:03:32] I only depend on you. I make mistakes. I
[2:03:36] have failures and things happen in my
[2:03:38] life. I have trials and but God I depend
[2:03:41] on you. You are the strongest one. Let
[2:03:44] me just feed from your breast. Let me
[2:03:46] just feed from your strength. That's
[2:03:48] when we have the victory. Amen. Can we
[2:03:51] pray all this this this this afternoon?
[2:03:53] Lord, give me the strength. Let me stay
[2:03:56] where my strength reside. Don't let me
[2:03:58] go out of the place where you can give
[2:04:00] me the strength. Is that the desire of
[2:04:02] your heart this evening? I want to hold

[2:14:03] Do you believe that?
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; It's still the same yesterday, today,
[2:14:07] and forever. And we have a place of
[2:14:10] refuge where we can find our place is in
[2:14:13] Jesus Christ, the strength giver, El
[2:14:16] Shadai. Thank you, Lord. Thank you for
[2:14:19] your word. Praise be to God. You know,
[2:14:23] as a as the church, we we are the weaker
[2:14:27] we are the weaker vessel.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; And God knows it. God knows it. He knows
[2:14:33] that you have your ups and downs. And he
[2:14:37] knows it. The most important thing, he
[2:14:39] knows.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; As the brother put it so well, he knows.
[2:14:43] Sometimes you don't know, but he knows.
[2:14:46] And he's leading you. is guiding you.
[2:14:49] Think about it. The three-fold purpose
[2:14:51] of God,
[2:14:53] he he accomplished
[2:14:55] one part in Jesus Christ.
[2:14:58] Why didn't accomplished when he was
[2:15:00] still God? One part he accomplished in
[2:15:02] Jesus Christ in a weaker
[2:15:06] position than than being the father
[2:15:10] because Jesus Christ didn't know at some
[2:15:12] point to say I don't know everything.
[2:15:15] The father has to reveal it to me. Then
[2:15:17] I do the work. But God was fulfilling
[2:15:20] his purpose. And now in the bride.
[2:15:24] So the other part I will have preminence
[2:15:26] in the bride. Why the bride is not the
[2:15:29] strongest part the strong? Why? Why God
[2:15:32] choose the strong the weakest place?
[2:15:34] Why? To show his purpose.
[2:15:36] But he chose it to be so. So that his
[2:15:40] attribute all the glory can be placed to
[2:15:43] him. But what we have to have is
[2:15:45] attitude. Lord, I depend on you
[2:15:47] completely. Help me to stay faithful.
[2:15:51] Help me to continue as that was the
[2:15:54] theme that God put in his in his heart.
[2:15:58] Whatever happens, you stay faithful.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; You stay faithful. You continue to come
[2:16:03] to church. You continue to serve the
[2:16:05] Lord. You continue to to be faithful.
[2:16:08] Your husband is hard on you. You stay
[2:16:10] continue be obedient to God and be nice
[2:16:12] to him. is the the the wife maybe is not
[2:16:15] hard on you. You continue to be obedient
[2:16:18] to love her unconditional love. You
[2:16:20] continue to be a Christian no matter the
[2:16:22] circumstances.
[2:16:24] That's was the burden that God put on
[2:16:26] his heart. He changes not change
[2:16:28] completely.
[2:16:30] No, no matter the situation you are
[2:16:32] going through,
[2:16:34] stay faithful.
[2:16:36] Sister Grace, sing that song for us.
[2:16:38] Help us to sing that song. So just in
[2:16:40] tune with the message, keep holding. I
[2:16:43] can't even walk without you holding my
[2:16:45] hand. Let's sing together as she's
[2:16:48] leading us.
[2:16:50] I can't even walk without you holding my
[2:16:54] hand.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, I can't even
[2:16:59] walk
[2:17:00] without you.
[2:17:04] [Music]
[2:17:07] The mountains
[2:17:09] too high
[2:17:12] and the valleyies
[2:17:14] to
[2:17:18] down on my knees.
[2:17:23] That's where I learned how to stand
[2:17:28] because I can't even
[2:17:32] walk without you holding
[2:17:36] my hand.
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; Oh no. Oh,
[2:17:42] I can't even
[2:17:46] walk
[2:17:47] without you holding
[2:17:50] my hand.
[2:17:52] [Music]
[2:17:54] The mountains
[2:17:56] too high
[2:17:58] and the valley
[2:18:01] to
[2:18:05] down on
[2:18:07] my knees.
[2:18:09] That's where I learn to stand
[2:18:14] because I can't even
[2:18:18] walk
[2:18:20] without you. holding
[2:18:23] my hand.
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; Can you sing verse two?
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; I thought I thought
[2:18:29] I had done
[2:18:32] Lord on
[2:18:35] my own.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; That's what we thought.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; We can do things on our own.
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; I was strong enough.
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; I don't need you. I don't need God. I
[2:18:45] don't need this.
[2:18:47] And I thought
[2:18:50] of myself
[2:18:52] as a mighty
[2:18:55] big one.
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, but I can
[2:19:01] walk
[2:19:02] without you holding
[2:19:06] my hand. Oh, I can't
[2:19:11] I can't even
[2:19:14] walk without you holding my hand.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; The mountains
[2:19:23] too high
[2:19:26] and the valleys
[2:19:28] still wide.
[2:19:31] Oh, but down on my knees,
[2:19:35] that's where I learn how to stand.
[2:19:40] Because I can't even
[2:19:44] walk without you holding
[2:19:48] my hand.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; Prophet says, I'm paraphrasing,
[2:19:55] whenever you think you are strong on
[2:19:57] your own, God can't use you. It's only
[2:20:00] when you realize that you are weak, then
[2:20:03] you are ready to be used by God.
[2:20:06] God, help us to understand that we
[2:20:09] depend completely on you.
[2:20:12] Depend on one another, too. Can't walk
[2:20:15] this walk by yourself. Depend on one
[2:20:17] another. I need you. You need me. Let's
[2:20:21] walk together. Thank you, pastor. God
[2:20:23] bless you richly for the word. Thank God
[2:20:26] for that.
[2:20:28] Thank God for that.
[2:20:32] Thank you for the suffering you went
[2:20:34] through that we have to change messages
[2:20:35] many times.
[2:20:37] Let it be. So it was sacrificial love.
[2:20:43] We are the beneficiary for that. Don't
[2:20:45] leave what we have heard. Don't let it
[2:20:48] be just special meetings. No, we had
[2:20:50] some special meetings. Now let's put it
[2:20:52] aside. Let's move forward to the other
[2:20:54] meetings. and what God took to us here.
[2:20:57] No, it's the past and then let's move
[2:20:58] forward. No, no, no, no, no. Lord, let
[2:21:00] me stop on that. Let meditate on what I
[2:21:03] heard this weekend. Father, I want that
[2:21:07] to be a reality. I want that to be a
[2:21:10] reality. Sometimes we It's a hard
[2:21:13] message sometimes to go to preach on
[2:21:15] things that can look like hard things
[2:21:17] you are going through, but God knows
[2:21:20] because we want it quick quick to pass
[2:21:22] quick. Sister Esther,
[2:21:24] Lord, help me to wait. If I have to
[2:21:26] wait, let me wait. If there is a purpose
[2:21:30] and I have to wait, God, let me wait. I
[2:21:33] rather wait for your purpose to be
[2:21:36] fulfilled than to a rash thing and it's
[2:21:39] not God's will. Amen. God bless you
[2:21:42] richly. And I just want to sing another
[2:21:44] song and then we'll be dismissed. Lord,
[2:21:46] I love you. Simple song, but I love you
[2:21:49] because you first loved me.

[2:30:06] Deacon was just reminding me that keep
[2:30:08] me in prayer for the missionary work
[2:30:11] trip that I'll be having on next month
[2:30:14] on the on the on the 12th. So keep that
[2:30:17] in prayer of November. Thank you, Papa
[2:30:19] Matendo. Keep that in prayer as we go
[2:30:22] separate ways. Think about that. On
[2:30:23] Wednesday, we'll pray about it again. So
[2:30:25] keep that in prayer. Thank you, Papa
[2:30:27] Matendo. But let's protect our sisters.
[2:30:30] Let's protect our wives. We will see God
[2:30:33] working mighty. The scripture that the
[2:30:35] pastor read was if you don't treat her
[2:30:38] properly, God can't even answer to your
[2:30:40] prayers. So if you ask for prayers, you
[2:30:44] want blessings your family, make sure
[2:30:47] that you take care of your wife
[2:30:49] properly. That's what was on my heart.
[2:30:52] Uh I I would have felt bad if I didn't
[2:30:54] say. Thank God that you reminded me. God
[2:30:57] bless you richly. Amen. Amen.
