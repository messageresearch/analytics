[35:58] obey more what the prophet has to say. I
[36:01] want to be more obedient. It applies to
[36:04] everyone,
[36:06] not only to the to the janitor, Sister
[36:09] Matabishi.
[36:11] It It applies to me,
[36:14] to Brother Ben, to every one of us. We
[36:16] have to be more listening, more
[36:18] obediently, more and be more sincere.
[36:21] Because if we're more sincere, we will
[36:24] get what we what not what we deserve. I
[36:27] was going to say what we deserve, but we
[36:29] don't deserve nothing. But you know
[36:31] what? his promise. We'll get all the
[36:33] promises of God. But most of all, I want
[36:36] to welcome our heavenly father, the
[36:39] father of all spirits. And we're all
[36:42] spirits here this morning. If you
[36:43] believe it or not, you're here in the
[36:44] flesh, but you're all a spirit.
[36:47] And he is our father. So this morning, I
[36:49] thought, you know, I just came to me. I
[36:51] I do things spontaneously.
[36:54] So I think we should honor our father
[36:56] who is in heaven. Can we all pray
[36:58] together? Let's say let's pray together.
[37:01] Our Father,
[37:03] who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name,
[37:09] thy kingdom come, thy will be done on
[37:12] earth as it is in heaven. Give us this
[37:16] day our daily bread, and forgive us our
[37:19] debts as we forgive our debtors,
[37:22] and lead us not into temptation,
[37:27] but deliver us from evil. For thine is
[37:31] the kingdom, the power, and the glory
[37:34] forever and ever. Amen. Amen. Now, we
[37:37] learned this in school, believe it or
[37:40] not. We don't we don't say that in in
[37:42] school no more, but you know, we and you
[37:44] know, I I forgot a couple of lines. Is
[37:46] that amazing? Amen. A preacher
[37:49] forgetting a couple lines of the Lord's
[37:50] Prayer isn't amazing. Amen.
[37:53] It's quite humorous. That's true. That's
[37:55] good, sister. You can laugh at me or
[37:57] laugh with me. Amen. Praise God.
[37:59] Hallelujah. It's good to be in the house
[38:00] of the Lord. And we're so happy to have
[38:03] brother Gilbert Vamateti with us. All
[38:06] the way from Calgary. Can you imagine
[38:08] Calgary? Amen. Amen. Our rival city.
[38:13] Amen. Well, they are our rival city,
[38:16] aren't they, brother? Amen. But not in
[38:18] the spirit. Not in the spiritual. Amen.
[38:20] May the Lord bless you this morning. And
[38:22] we're going to hear a message, I
[38:24] believe, on adoption.
[38:26] I'm announcing it for him. Amen.
[38:29] Amen. Adoption is not your, you know,
[38:32] it's not about the new birth. Now, you
[38:34] all have to be born again.
[38:36] It's about getting into our position.
[38:39] And that's is very, very important. All
[38:42] of us, we need to get in our position in
[38:45] the Lord. Hallelujah. That means we got
[38:47] some things to do.
[38:50] We have some inviting to do. We have we
[38:52] have some spreading this message to do.
[38:56] Who's going to spread the messages? the
[38:58] preachers. No, it's going to be the the
[39:01] sheep that is going to spread the
[39:03] message all over the place. Can you how
[39:05] many can say amen? So, let's get to
[39:07] work. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise God. So,
[39:11] I'm going to invite our brother, you
[39:13] know, I don't want to take take too much
[39:14] time. Brother Kilbert, just come. Just
[39:16] come now. Amen. What What chorus are you
[39:19] playing?
[39:21] Okay, brother. Heavenly Father,
[39:25] I am praising
[39:29] you.
[39:34] Heavenly Father,

[39:41] heart wide.
[39:46] Amen. I love you. I adore you. I

[40:13] Amen. God bless you.
[40:16] No, you can do better than that.
[40:20] God bless you. Thank you, musician.
[40:23] Thank you, brother Joseph.
[40:26] I'm happy to be in my second home. Amen.
[40:35] I want to greet you all in the name of
[40:37] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[40:42] Uh I also bring you greetings from our
[40:44] little fellowship in Le Bridge. Amen.
[40:48] and also from my wife. She's she
[40:53] was attacked by the demon of high blood
[40:56] pressure on Friday
[40:58] and it it has been so severe on her and
[41:02] that's why she couldn't make it to come
[41:04] with me this morning. But by his stripes
[41:07] we are here.
[41:10] Amen.
[41:14] I'm so happy.
[41:18] that the songs that were sung this
[41:20] morning, the prayer that the prayer that
[41:23] was prayed and even the last one that
[41:27] was my theme. So we can say the sermon
[41:30] is already complete.
[41:33] So we just read a few the scriptures and
[41:36] a few quotes then uh we go home.
[41:41] Let's turn to our Bibles. Genesis
[41:44] chapter 1
[42:00] Genesis chapter 1 we'll read verse 27
[42:03] and 28
[42:05] then chapter 5 verse 1 and verse
[42:22] Let's pray before we read.
[42:24] Our
[42:26] dear most blessed savior,
[42:31] our father who art in heaven,
[42:35] we want to invite your presence once
[42:37] again this morning.
[42:40] According to your word, you said where
[42:43] two or three will gather in your name.
[42:47] You promise to be in their midst.
[42:50] Here we are more than two.
[42:53] Now we pray Lord Jesus may you come Lord
[42:58] may thy kingdom come
[43:01] may you come and have preeeminence in
[43:03] our mid father oh dear Lord Jesus Christ
[43:08] one time your disciples asked thee that
[43:11] teach us how to pray
[43:14] not that they didn't know how to pray
[43:16] but they wanted to do exactly according
[43:19] to your will father Lord Jesus Christ
[43:23] and you answered their desire by showing
[43:26] them how to pray. Loving master, we pray
[43:30] this morning Lord Jesus that if there
[43:32] will be anything that would hinder your
[43:34] presence in our meetings, Father, we
[43:37] bring everything under the altar.
[43:40] We pray Lord Jesus Christ that you may
[43:42] wash us and cleanse us. Father, may you
[43:45] cleanse our minds. May you cleanse our
[43:47] lips, Father. Lord Jesus Christ, just
[43:50] take me out of the way. I don't want to
[43:52] be a hindrance for your children to
[43:54] receive what thou has prepared for them,
[43:57] Lord. Father, I pray as I commit this
[44:00] church in your hands, they have been so
[44:02] welcoming to us, Father, may you bless
[44:04] them in a special way, Lord. Any time
[44:07] they call unto thee, may you may you
[44:09] always come on the scene, Lord, and
[44:11] manifest yourself in their mitties. Oh,
[44:14] we bless your name. We worship you. We
[44:16] adore you, Father. Now as we go to read
[44:19] your word in the name of the Lord Jesus
[44:22] Christ, may you breathe the breath of
[44:24] life upon the scriptures that we are
[44:26] going to read. Lord, loving master, even
[44:29] as the prophet said, anybody who knows
[44:31] how to read can read and that anything
[44:34] we any any one of us can do, heavenly
[44:36] father, but now we want you to come and
[44:39] take control of the service. We commit
[44:42] it in your hands as we surrender
[44:43] ourselves to your will. For it's in
[44:45] Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[44:48] Amen. Genesis 1 verse 27
[44:54] and 28. So, so God created man in his
[44:58] own image, in the image of God created
[45:02] he him, male and female created he them.
[45:08] And God blessed them. And God said unto
[45:11] them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and
[45:15] replenish the earth, and subdue it, and
[45:18] have dominion over the fish of the sea,
[45:21] and over the fall of the air, and over
[45:25] every living thing that moveth upon the
[45:28] earth."
[45:30] Chapter 5, verse one and two.
[45:39] This is the book of the generations of
[45:42] Adam.
[45:44] In the day that God created man in the
[45:47] likeness of God made he him.
[45:52] Male and female created he them and
[45:56] blessed them and called their name Adam.
[45:59] Amen. In the day when they were created.
[46:03] Amen. May God bless the reading of the
[46:06] word. You can have your seats. Amen.
[46:20] Now,
[46:22] we've been talking about adoption
[46:26] and uh it's a very wide subject
[46:32] and that doesn't mean that I I'm asking
[46:34] to come back.
[46:39] But uh this morning we'll see how far
[46:42] God will lead us.
[46:44] Now the Bible
[46:47] starts in Genesis with marriage.
[46:51] That's true.
[46:53] And it concludes in Revelation with
[46:55] marriage.
[46:58] In between here are the stories of love.
[47:03] Hello
[47:05] So in the beginning it starts with
[47:08] marriage.
[47:10] In the beginning it concludes with
[47:13] marriage.
[47:15] The marriage of the lamb has come. Amen.
[47:19] Now we are going for the marriage
[47:22] supper. Amen. So for those who will go
[47:26] for the marriage supper are the ones who
[47:28] have been invited.
[47:30] So I want to invite you this morning to
[47:34] join me as we talk about the story of
[47:36] love in between here.
[47:39] Now
[47:50] in the message of Christ is the mystery
[47:53] of God revealed.
[47:56] The prophet says that God had threefold
[48:00] purposes.
[48:02] One, he wanted to reveal himself. Amen.
[48:06] That one he did in the body of Jesus
[48:09] Christ.
[48:10] Two, he wanted to have preeeminence
[48:15] in the body of believers.
[48:18] Once he achieves that,
[48:21] then he resto.
[48:24] Now that restoration
[48:31] there is a doctrine that we we are being
[48:33] restored back to Pentecost. That is
[48:36] true. But restoration has two parts.
[48:41] One restoration back to Pentecost.
[48:45] Then the second restoration is the
[48:48] restoration back to Eden. Amen.
[48:51] Where
[48:53] where the scripture that we have read,
[48:56] let's read it. Genesis 1:28.
[49:00] Oh my goodness.
[49:04] And God said, "Let us make man in our
[49:07] image, after our likeness, and let them
[49:11] have dominion over the fish of the sea,
[49:14] and over the fall of the air, and over
[49:17] the cattle, and over all the earth, and
[49:20] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[49:23] upon the earth." That is 26. So God
[49:26] created man in his own image. In the
[49:29] image of God created he him. Male and
[49:33] female created he them. Amen. Amen.
[49:38] Here was Adam.
[49:40] But in him,
[49:43] hello. In him there was male and female
[49:48] in Adam.
[49:51] So Eve was in Adam. Yes. Hello. Amen.
[49:56] Then verse 28, it says,
[49:59] "And God blessed them, and God said unto
[50:03] them, be fruitful and multiply and
[50:07] replenish the earth and subdue it and
[50:10] have dominion." Oh my God. Amen. Be
[50:13] fruitful. Who? It was only Adam.
[50:18] Hello.
[50:20] How was he to be fruitful and multiply?
[50:24] So in him there was Evemen.
[50:28] So our restoration
[50:30] is to be restored back. Amen. Amen. Into
[50:36] him.
[50:39] Hello. Amen. So that God and the bride
[50:43] becomes one. Amen.
[50:47] We can finish there and go home.
[50:51] So our restoration is to be restored
[50:55] back to him.
[50:58] Now when Eve was in Adam,
[51:03] oh my goodness, thank you brother
[51:04] Joseph. No danger of falling while here
[51:10] I remain.
[51:13] When you get inside there, there is no
[51:16] danger of falling.
[51:18] Amen.
[51:20] While inside there, so as long as if if
[51:25] could have remained inside there, there
[51:27] was no danger of falling. But when he
[51:30] was separated,
[51:33] then it opened a channel for the fall.
[51:37] So anytime as long as if is not in Adam,
[51:43] there is a danger of falling.
[51:48] Hello.
[51:50] Can we get to a point where we can say
[51:53] there is no danger of falling? Yes.
[51:56] Amen. The answer is found in Ephesians.
[52:00] Okay. Chapter one.
[52:02] Oh my goodness. I am just enjoying
[52:05] myself with this subject. Hallelujah.
[52:08] Oh my.
[52:12] Ephesians
[52:15] chapter 1
[52:21] verse 10.
[52:25] Okay, let's start from verse 9. having
[52:28] made known unto us the mystery of his
[52:32] will according to his good pleasure
[52:35] which he hath purposed in himself
[52:38] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[52:41] of times he might gather together in one
[52:45] all things in Christ. Hallelujah. So the
[52:49] gathering is going on now in the
[52:53] dispensation of the fullness of time.
[52:57] Now when we talk about the dispensation
[52:59] is not a specific time that at exactly
[53:03] 10 you must be on the pullpit. No it is
[53:06] a it is a continuous season.
[53:10] So in the dispensation of the fullness
[53:14] of time we are living in the fullness of
[53:18] time. Now in the fullness of time the
[53:21] gathering is going on now. Amen. In who?
[53:26] in Christ.
[53:28] So that gathering in Christ is what we
[53:31] what we are calling being restored back.
[53:35] Amen. Into the second Adam
[53:42] Oh my.
[53:45] Amen.
[53:48] God bless you saints.
[53:51] Oh my
[53:56] Now in the message five definite
[53:58] identifications of the true church of
[54:01] the living God paragraph 66. If you are
[54:06] a Christian you are born again creature.
[54:11] You are in a mystic kingdom of God.
[54:15] Your eyes are not on things of this
[54:18] world but on things above. That is when
[54:22] you are in the church.
[54:29] No, you didn't get it.
[54:34] When you are born again,
[54:38] so the condition is you must be born
[54:41] again.
[54:43] Now, how are you born again?
[54:46] Then you must be born by the word to be
[54:49] the word. Amen. Amen. Hello. Amen. You
[54:53] must be born by the word to be the word.
[55:02] Now, what is God's chosen place of
[55:05] worship?
[55:07] It is in the Holy Spirit. Amen. And
[55:10] that's why in that mortal prayer,
[55:15] Jesus said, "Let thy kingdom come."
[55:19] And the kingdom of God is the Holy
[55:22] Spirit.
[55:24] So
[55:26] having you must be born again.
[55:31] You must have the Holy Spirit.
[55:37] Oh my. Yes.
[55:39] I quoted here sometimes back
[55:42] where the prophet says
[55:46] the reason you are hungering and
[55:48] thirsting for the Holy Spirit
[55:52] is because he made a provision. He
[55:55] ordained you for for he orained for you
[55:58] to have it.
[56:00] Those who are not ordained to have it,
[56:03] they don't even bother. Amen.
[56:06] They can stay in the church fulfilling
[56:09] religious duties.
[56:14] Sorry, you you will bear with me.
[56:18] Yeah.
[56:19] But those who are ordained,
[56:23] you will hunger and thirst,
[56:27] you must have it. Amen.
[56:30] Why? Because we will okay we'll come to
[56:33] it. By one spirit we are baptized into
[56:36] that body. Amen. Amen. So it is the Holy
[56:41] Spirit baptizing you into the body which
[56:44] is the Holy Spirit.
[56:47] Then inside there you find your
[56:49] position.
[56:51] Amen. That's right.
[56:53] Now once you find your position
[56:56] then you can sing as long as I'm there
[56:59] is no danger of falling.
[57:02] Why? Now you know who you are.
[57:06] Oh my.
[57:10] Okay.
[57:12] They're talking paragraph
[57:14] 178 here friends. If you ever was healed
[57:18] or if you ever was healed, if you live
[57:22] long enough, you are going to get sick
[57:24] again.
[57:26] But if you are one time take that token,
[57:29] you will you will have had it forever.
[57:32] Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God
[57:35] whereby you are sealed until the day of
[57:38] your redemption,
[57:40] not to the next revival. You wasn't
[57:43] sealed. You got emotionally worked up.
[57:49] Hello.
[57:51] Now, we just don't want to be
[57:53] emotionally worked up.
[57:56] We want to be sealed inside.
[57:59] Once you are sealed inside, then you
[58:01] take your position.
[58:04] Oh,
[58:08] okay.
[58:12] Inside there
[58:14] you are in his fullness.
[58:18] In him is all the fullness of God. All
[58:22] the fullness of the promise.
[58:25] Now what is our promise?
[58:29] Hebrews 11. Let's go there.
[58:42] Hebrews 11:39.
[58:46] All this
[58:49] it's all about the heroes of faith.
[58:53] Yeah, you can imagine
[58:57] all the heroes of faith. But verse 39
[59:01] says, all these having obtained a good
[59:05] report through faith received not the
[59:07] promise.
[59:11] Amen. You mean Abraham never received
[59:14] the promise
[59:20] or the prophets?
[59:23] Yes.
[59:24] Then what was the promise?
[59:27] Verse 40. God having provided some
[59:30] better thing for us that they without us
[59:34] should not be made perfect.
[59:39] So Abraham without you.
[59:44] Oh my. Can we believe that?
[59:50] Why are you doubting what God has made
[59:52] you?
[59:58] Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Okay,
[1:00:05] listen. Christ is the mystery of God
[1:00:07] revealed. Paragraph 240. The new path is
[1:00:10] Christ is a revelation. God has revealed
[1:00:14] to you this great mystery and that is a
[1:00:18] new path. Now what are you going to do
[1:00:21] when you get all that group together
[1:00:24] where the revelation is perfectly in
[1:00:27] harmony? God expressing it through his
[1:00:31] word, by the same actions, the same
[1:00:34] things that he did, making the word
[1:00:38] manifest. Oh, if the church only knew
[1:00:41] its position, it will one day, then the
[1:00:46] rapture will go when it knows what it
[1:00:49] is.
[1:00:51] Amen.
[1:00:55] Oh, if the church only knew its
[1:00:59] position,
[1:01:01] what is that position?
[1:01:04] It is your position in the body of Jesus
[1:01:07] Christ. And that body of Jesus Christ,
[1:01:11] it is a mystical body.
[1:01:15] How do you get into that body? By one
[1:01:18] spirit, we are baptized into that body.
[1:01:21] that mystical body.
[1:01:24] Allow me to say this. You can be in this
[1:01:27] church and you are not in that body.
[1:01:31] Yeah.
[1:01:33] So we are not just talking about
[1:01:35] membership
[1:01:38] no we are talking about those who are in
[1:01:41] the mystical body
[1:01:44] and they have found their place
[1:01:48] and they are at rest. Yes.
[1:01:51] Amen. With the storms comes. Yes.
[1:01:56] Yeah.
[1:01:58] The dangers, the dolls and everything.
[1:02:01] Yes.
[1:02:02] But you know you are standing.
[1:02:05] You know where you are standing. You can
[1:02:08] sing. There is no danger of falling.
[1:02:11] Amen.
[1:02:13] Oh my.
[1:02:16] Okay.
[1:02:21] Amen.
[1:02:23] Okay.
[1:02:28] The mystery is in the evening time where
[1:02:32] God has purposed to take this woman back
[1:02:34] to her position in Christ Jesus.
[1:02:37] The woman being taken to her position is
[1:02:40] what we are calling adoption.
[1:02:44] The woman being taken back to her
[1:02:47] position.
[1:02:53] Okay.
[1:02:55] Once in her position, she will never
[1:02:58] fail.
[1:03:04] Okay.
[1:03:05] the revelation of God to take Eve to her
[1:03:08] position in Christ. Put that great
[1:03:11] mystery in the woman and once she
[1:03:14] catches it.
[1:03:19] Yeah. How is she to be taken back?
[1:03:22] Please just allow me. Today I will go
[1:03:24] very slowly.
[1:03:27] Yeah. I just want to be a Sunday school
[1:03:28] teacher
[1:03:30] so that even my pastor can can follow
[1:03:33] it. Yeah, we are taking we are saying
[1:03:37] the the woman being taken back to her
[1:03:41] position. Who is this woman? The bride.
[1:03:46] Yeah. Now when the bride is taken back
[1:03:49] to her position, where is her position
[1:03:53] in the body of Jesus Christ?
[1:03:56] Okay. Now, how do we how can we put this
[1:04:01] woman back or how is she going to be put
[1:04:03] back? Put that great mystery.
[1:04:08] Yeah.
[1:04:10] Unto her. And once she catches that
[1:04:13] mystery.
[1:04:15] Yeah. The mystery of his will. Yeah. And
[1:04:21] that mystery of his will is the promise
[1:04:25] that was made that without this, without
[1:04:28] us,
[1:04:30] the heroes of faith could not be made
[1:04:33] perfect.
[1:04:34] So perfection is here.
[1:04:37] [Music]
[1:04:39] Oh my.
[1:04:41] Perfection is here.
[1:04:45] So put that great mystery in the woman
[1:04:48] and once she catches it, she goes back
[1:04:51] in her position. Then the rapture takes
[1:04:53] place.
[1:04:58] So who is holding the rapture is for the
[1:05:01] woman for that woman to catch the
[1:05:04] revelation that great mystery.
[1:05:08] Oh my.
[1:05:10] And the prophet says, "Hell is against
[1:05:16] this revelation."
[1:05:20] Yeah.
[1:05:22] Hell is against this revelation. Amen.
[1:05:28] I'll repeat it again. Hell is against
[1:05:32] this revelation. Why is hell against
[1:05:35] this revelation? Because once the woman
[1:05:39] catches that revelation and she's taken
[1:05:42] back into her position, the rapture
[1:05:44] takes place. Hallelujah.
[1:05:49] Amen.
[1:05:55] Jesus Christ told Peter, let's let's
[1:05:58] read it. Matthew 16.
[1:06:02] Oh my.
[1:06:08] Please pray for me.
[1:06:10] I would like this one to sink so that we
[1:06:13] know our position. Amen.
[1:06:16] We stop being church members so that we
[1:06:19] know who we are.
[1:06:21] Oh yes.
[1:06:25] 16:16. And Peter and Simon Peter
[1:06:29] answered and said, "Thou art the Christ,
[1:06:31] the son of the living God." Verse 17.
[1:06:34] And Jesus answered and said unto him,
[1:06:36] Blessed art thou Simon perjonah, for
[1:06:39] flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[1:06:42] unto thee, but my father which is in
[1:06:45] heaven. And I say unto thee that thou
[1:06:48] art Peter, and upon this rock I will
[1:06:51] build my church, and the gates of hell
[1:06:54] shall not prevail against it.
[1:06:56] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:06:59] The gates of hell shall not prevail.
[1:07:05] Now what are these gates of hell?
[1:07:10] Do you want to know?
[1:07:13] The gates of hell are denominations.
[1:07:19] Anything
[1:07:23] that hinders you from accessing heaven,
[1:07:27] that is hell. Amen. Amen. Yeah. So the
[1:07:32] gates of hell are denominations.
[1:07:35] And the prophet said you can be a oneman
[1:07:37] denomination. That's true.
[1:07:41] Yeah. So if you are a oneman
[1:07:44] denomination, know that that is the K of
[1:07:46] error.
[1:07:48] True.
[1:07:50] Yeah.
[1:07:52] Now this great revelation
[1:07:57] kids of hell cannot prevail against it.
[1:08:01] Hallelujah.
[1:08:03] Hell is against it.
[1:08:07] Against what? This great mystery
[1:08:09] revelation. Because once this woman
[1:08:12] catches that revelation
[1:08:15] God open my understanding. Amen. God,
[1:08:19] take away the spiritual mania. Open my
[1:08:22] eyes. I want to see these things. I want
[1:08:26] to see it clearly. Why? Because once the
[1:08:30] woman catches that revelation, Amen.
[1:08:33] Nothing can hold her here. So what is
[1:08:36] holding us today is to catch this
[1:08:39] revelation.
[1:08:41] It is it is this revelation. Once we
[1:08:44] catch this revelation, then we are
[1:08:47] restored back into Christ.
[1:08:51] Then Christ and the bride become one.
[1:08:59] God help us.
[1:09:02] Oh yes. Are we together saints?
[1:09:07] We need that revelation.
[1:09:09] Oh yes. The prophet says, "Why do you
[1:09:12] hunger, church?
[1:09:15] Why do you hunger?"
[1:09:17] It's because God wants to reveal this
[1:09:21] revelation to you.
[1:09:24] Amen. You are hungering because God
[1:09:28] wants to reveal to you this mystery.
[1:09:32] But we let so many things.
[1:09:36] Oh yes.
[1:09:40] There was a story
[1:09:43] about uh somebody who was saving some
[1:09:45] money to buy a house
[1:09:49] and uh after he saved some good money
[1:09:52] then he was involved in an accident
[1:09:55] and he was rushed to the hospital
[1:09:58] and uh he needed an operation
[1:10:03] and they they knew he had some money so
[1:10:05] they asked him
[1:10:08] can do we take your money so that we pay
[1:10:11] for the operation? He said no.
[1:10:18] He said I would rather die than for the
[1:10:20] money to be taken.
[1:10:23] Now the doctors asked him please dead
[1:10:27] bodies they don't stay in houses.
[1:10:32] Yeah. Dead bodies they don't stay in
[1:10:36] houses.
[1:10:37] So you need this operation. But he said
[1:10:40] no. What am I trying to say?
[1:10:45] The things we are holding on.
[1:10:48] We don't want to surrender.
[1:10:52] Hello.
[1:10:54] That money cannot be touched but it will
[1:10:57] save your life.
[1:11:01] Yeah.
[1:11:02] So why do you hung a church? It's
[1:11:05] because the father
[1:11:07] wants to reveal this great mystery to
[1:11:10] you. But we let so many things. Amen.
[1:11:15] What are these things? It can be your
[1:11:18] job.
[1:11:21] It can be your wife. It can be your
[1:11:23] husband. The prophet says it can even be
[1:11:27] a pastor
[1:11:29] who doesn't want to preach this great
[1:11:32] mystery so that your eyes of
[1:11:35] understanding can be opened. Amen.
[1:11:39] Yeah.
[1:11:41] So we read so many things to hinder
[1:11:45] us from accessing this great mystery and
[1:11:48] that's why hell is against it.
[1:11:53] God help us. Amen. Yeah.
[1:11:57] Why hell is against us? So that we
[1:12:00] continue staying around. Yeah.
[1:12:05] Just want to stay around.
[1:12:08] You are talking about the rapture and I
[1:12:10] just bought a new house. I've not even
[1:12:12] enjoyed it.
[1:12:16] Oh, you are talking about the rapture
[1:12:18] and yet I'm not yet married.
[1:12:21] No, I have to get married and enjoy
[1:12:24] enjoy life.
[1:12:27] Yeah, God help us.
[1:12:31] We just have to surrender.
[1:12:34] If this morning, thank you, brother
[1:12:36] Joseph. If this morning we can
[1:12:38] surrender,
[1:12:40] yeah, surrender that thing that you are
[1:12:42] holding on. Amen.
[1:12:44] If I can surrender it for God to have
[1:12:48] preeminence once he achieves that second
[1:12:52] purpose. Amen.
[1:12:56] Oh my. Allow me to say this. Hell is not
[1:12:59] against the first pool.
[1:13:02] Hell is not against the second pool.
[1:13:06] Hell is against the third pool. Amen.
[1:13:11] Where you catch the revelation, the word
[1:13:14] is revealed to you. Amen.
[1:13:18] Once the word is revealed to you, then
[1:13:21] what happens? You are restored back in
[1:13:24] your position. Amen.
[1:13:27] Amen. Oh my.
[1:13:32] Oh my.
[1:13:39] When the mystery is completely revealed,
[1:13:42] the headship is here.
[1:13:47] What is the coming of the headship?
[1:13:50] So that the head and the body can be
[1:13:53] joined together. Yes. Yeah.
[1:13:58] We will try to eat.
[1:14:01] Amen.
[1:14:03] Okay.
[1:14:06] Okay.
[1:14:10] The headship is here.
[1:14:13] I wasn't the one that appeared down on
[1:14:15] the river.
[1:14:17] I was only standing there when he
[1:14:20] appeared.
[1:14:21] Now, who appeared? Yes, sir. Christ.
[1:14:25] Amen. Why did he appear?
[1:14:29] We are identified by our faces. Yeah. If
[1:14:34] you chop off the head and hide this and
[1:14:38] hide this f this the face, nobody will
[1:14:41] know that this is Gilbert. Yeah. It was
[1:14:44] just some black pharaoh. Yeah. But once
[1:14:48] the head is put there, then you say,
[1:14:51] "Oh, I know this guy."
[1:14:53] Yeah.
[1:14:55] So, what are we saying? Hallelujah.
[1:14:57] Christ came down to take a selfie
[1:15:02] and the selfie was taken so that now we
[1:15:05] know he's here.
[1:15:07] We are not waiting for him. We know he's
[1:15:09] here. What is he doing? We are uniting
[1:15:13] with him. How do we unite with him? The
[1:15:16] more you eat the word, the more you
[1:15:18] become the word. So keep on eating the
[1:15:21] word. Keep on eating the word. Amen.
[1:15:25] Thank you Lord. Oh my
[1:15:31] God help us.
[1:15:34] But we are promised according to
[1:15:36] Revelation 10 and according to Malachi 4
[1:15:40] and St. Luke 17.
[1:15:43] Oh, we can add other scriptures.
[1:15:46] St. John 14:20.
[1:15:49] Yeah. Zechariah 14.
[1:15:52] Oh yes.
[1:15:54] Hebrews 13:8, he's the same yesterday,
[1:15:57] today, and forever. All these promises
[1:16:01] that we have been promised,
[1:16:03] we are at the end there. Amen.
[1:16:07] Oh yes. We can say these scriptures have
[1:16:11] been fulfilled in our eyes.
[1:16:15] Oh yes.
[1:16:18] What are they for? To bring us another
[1:16:21] Ephesians. Amen. Ephesians types the
[1:16:25] book of Joshua. Joshua took the children
[1:16:29] of Israel into the promised land. So our
[1:16:33] Ephesians is to put us positionally.
[1:16:38] Hello. Amen. Our Ephesians is to put us
[1:16:42] positionally
[1:16:43] in the body of Christ. Inside there we
[1:16:48] have blessings. All right. Let's read
[1:16:49] it. Ephesians 1. Oh my
[1:16:54] God help us.
[1:16:59] Okay.
[1:17:04] Verse three and four.
[1:17:12] Blessed be the God and Father of our
[1:17:14] Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us
[1:17:18] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[1:17:21] places in Christ,
[1:17:24] according as as he hath chosen us in him
[1:17:28] before the foundation of the world, that
[1:17:31] we should be holy and without blame
[1:17:34] before him in love.
[1:17:36] Blessed be the God and father who has
[1:17:39] blessed us with all spiritual blessings.
[1:17:47] We may rejoice because of the worldly
[1:17:49] blessings. That is fine. But we are
[1:17:53] talking about the spiritual blessings.
[1:17:57] Yeah.
[1:17:59] according as he hath chosen us in him
[1:18:02] before the foundation of the world that
[1:18:05] we should be holy and without blame
[1:18:07] before him in love.
[1:18:12] He hath chosen us in him.
[1:18:18] I'm sorry.
[1:18:20] Okay.
[1:18:23] Now
[1:18:29] I wish this light could come on
[1:18:33] but um
[1:18:35] let's see
[1:18:42] now our Lord Jesus Christ is so full of
[1:18:45] quickening power. He was all of it
[1:18:49] together. He was so full of the
[1:18:52] quickening power. He said this, "You
[1:18:54] destroy this body and I will raise it up
[1:18:57] in three days." Talk about confidence in
[1:19:00] the quickening power.
[1:19:04] What is the quickening power? Is the
[1:19:05] revelation.
[1:19:08] Now in Romans the Bible says, "If that
[1:19:11] spirit that raised up Jesus Christ
[1:19:13] dwelleth in you, Amen. It will also
[1:19:17] quicken
[1:19:19] your motor.
[1:19:21] It will also quicken. So we need the
[1:19:24] same spirit.
[1:19:26] Yeah. We need the same spirit that was
[1:19:30] in Jesus.
[1:19:34] Oh my.
[1:19:40] The message a guide paragraph 35. And
[1:19:44] the Holy Spirit always speaks of the
[1:19:46] word. I've got many things to tell you.
[1:19:49] You cannot understand it now. But when
[1:19:52] he comes, he will guide you to it.
[1:19:55] That's the reason the coming of the
[1:19:57] seals.
[1:20:02] No, you didn't get it. I
[1:20:07] expected a big
[1:20:10] Yeah.
[1:20:11] The Holy Spirit always speaks of the
[1:20:14] word. Amen. I've got many things to tell
[1:20:18] you. You cannot understand it now. So
[1:20:21] without the Holy Spirit, you cannot
[1:20:24] understand anything.
[1:20:28] Yeah.
[1:20:34] But when he comes, he will guide you to
[1:20:38] it. That is the reason the coming of the
[1:20:41] seals
[1:20:43] at the finishing of the seventh seal.
[1:20:46] The mystery of God should be finished.
[1:20:48] Amen. To know who God is, what he is,
[1:20:53] how he lives, his nature, his being. You
[1:20:57] are supposed to be all the way up here
[1:21:00] by that time. See, bring us into the
[1:21:03] full stature of sons and daughters of
[1:21:06] God. Amen. A church that has been washed
[1:21:09] in the blood of Christ that has been
[1:21:12] bought without money is paid for by the
[1:21:15] blood of Jesus Christ. Oh my. We are
[1:21:20] supposed to be way up here now.
[1:21:23] Yes. But what is happening?
[1:21:27] Because hell is a chemist. Amen. This
[1:21:31] revelation.
[1:21:33] Hello. Amen. Why do you hung a church?
[1:21:37] God wants to reveal this revelation to
[1:21:39] you, this mystery to you. Amen. Why?
[1:21:43] Hell is against it. He will do all that
[1:21:46] he can. Hello.
[1:21:50] He will do all that he can. How? You can
[1:21:54] be seated here. Then he takes you a
[1:21:56] thousand miles away.
[1:21:59] You start working on a certain project.
[1:22:03] Yeah. Because he knows once you catch
[1:22:06] that revelation.
[1:22:07] Hello.
[1:22:09] What happens? The rapture will take
[1:22:11] place.
[1:22:14] God help us. Am I communicating
[1:22:18] pastor? Am I saying?
[1:22:20] Yeah.
[1:22:22] Hell is against this truth
[1:22:27] of the mystery.
[1:22:31] Why are you preaching the mysteries?
[1:22:34] Am I preaching the mysteries? I'm only
[1:22:36] preaching the seven seals.
[1:22:40] And that was the coming of the seven
[1:22:42] seals. Who came down? Christ. Amen. For
[1:22:46] what? He came as the head so that he can
[1:22:49] unite with the body for the body to
[1:22:52] become one. Amen. For the wife and the
[1:22:56] husband to become one. Amen. That's
[1:23:00] right.
[1:23:01] So the union is going on.
[1:23:06] The union is going on.
[1:23:09] Lord, help me.
[1:23:12] Help me.
[1:23:16] Let me get united.
[1:23:19] Let nothing hinder me.
[1:23:23] Let nothing hinder me.
[1:23:28] God have mercy on us.
[1:23:32] Amen.
[1:23:34] Okay.
[1:23:37] Adoption part three.
[1:23:40] Now the invisible union.
[1:23:44] The invisible union.
[1:23:48] That union is adoption
[1:23:51] where you get into your position.
[1:23:55] Hello.
[1:23:57] So the invisible union is going on.
[1:24:03] When the pride is married to her
[1:24:05] husband, then we say she has found her
[1:24:08] position in her husband.
[1:24:15] When she's married to her husband,
[1:24:20] this marriage is an invisible union.
[1:24:25] Hello.
[1:24:28] Am I communicating?
[1:24:31] The marriage is an invisible union.
[1:24:36] But we want things we can see.
[1:24:40] Yeah.
[1:24:44] And that is the biggest problem. We want
[1:24:47] things we can see. Okay. Fine. It's
[1:24:49] good.
[1:24:50] Yeah. We want to see you in the church.
[1:24:53] [Laughter]
[1:24:56] Yeah, the pastor will be happy to see
[1:24:57] you in the church.
[1:24:59] That is fine. But the invisible union.
[1:25:03] Yeah. Even if you are seated here, what
[1:25:07] matters is the invisible
[1:25:10] union. Amen. You get united with your
[1:25:14] husband. Amen. Once you get united, that
[1:25:18] is getting now into your position.
[1:25:22] Amen.
[1:25:25] The prophet says in heavenly places. Oh
[1:25:29] yeah, we are seated in heavenly places.
[1:25:33] Where are these heavenly places? The
[1:25:35] prophet says it is the believer's
[1:25:38] position
[1:25:40] in the body of Jesus Christ. The
[1:25:43] believers.
[1:25:45] Am I speaking to the believers? Amen.
[1:25:49] Am I speaking to the believers? Amen.
[1:25:52] Now the believer's position in the body
[1:25:56] of Jesus Christ
[1:25:59] once you get your position you will not
[1:26:02] even fight with your sister or your
[1:26:04] brother. Amen.
[1:26:06] Yeah.
[1:26:08] Hello.
[1:26:10] Why? Why fight?
[1:26:12] When Joshua was allotting the positions
[1:26:15] in the in the land of Canaan. Yeah.
[1:26:19] There was no fight. Yeah. You take your
[1:26:23] position. Your position is from here up
[1:26:25] to here. Or you your position is from
[1:26:27] here up to here. Take your position.
[1:26:30] Once you take your position, you have no
[1:26:32] time to fight your brother or sister.
[1:26:34] Amen. Amen.
[1:26:39] Hello. Amen.
[1:26:42] God help us.
[1:26:46] Okay.
[1:26:48] Now we are paragraph adoption part three
[1:26:51] paragraph 34. Now we are going to stop
[1:26:54] just a second on the adoption the fifth
[1:26:56] verse trying to get down as far as we
[1:27:00] possibly can on it. But now remember the
[1:27:03] theme is it is all together on blessing.
[1:27:07] How many understands that? Let's hear
[1:27:10] you say it with one word blessing.
[1:27:14] Congregation says blessing. the body of
[1:27:19] Jesus Christ positionally.
[1:27:24] Amen.
[1:27:26] So, can we say the blessing is going on?
[1:27:30] Positionally in the body of Jesus
[1:27:33] Christ. Amen. Oh my. And watch this
[1:27:38] master Paul. The first thing he does is
[1:27:41] knock out all the idea of falling away.
[1:27:49] Oh, today you are in, tomorrow you are
[1:27:52] out.
[1:27:54] Yeah.
[1:27:57] Hello.
[1:27:59] No, you look so dull.
[1:28:02] We can end there.
[1:28:04] Yeah. Am I communicating? Amen.
[1:28:08] Imagine Paul is knocking out the idea of
[1:28:12] falling.
[1:28:15] Thank you Lord.
[1:28:19] Now when we were singing that songh
[1:28:23] that no danger of falling we were
[1:28:25] singing at the topest part of our
[1:28:27] voices. But now here is the quote to
[1:28:30] support what you are singing. You keep
[1:28:31] quiet.
[1:28:35] Oh my goodness. Okay. Now knock out all
[1:28:40] the idea of ever being a Christian today
[1:28:43] and tomorrow. I'm gone and the next day
[1:28:46] God condemned me and the next day I am
[1:28:49] back again. That is nonsense. It's the
[1:28:51] prophet not me.
[1:28:54] This book is not addressed to
[1:28:57] evangelistic teaching, evangelist
[1:29:00] sermons. I don't touch this on the
[1:29:02] fields. I bring this to the church for
[1:29:05] Paul addressed it to the saints.
[1:29:09] How many saints are here? Amen. So, it's
[1:29:13] addressed to you.
[1:29:15] I bring this to the church. Paul
[1:29:17] addressed it to the saints. Those that
[1:29:20] are called and preserved and are filled
[1:29:23] and are set aside and are in the Holy
[1:29:26] Spirit already in canon. Amen. How many
[1:29:30] are in canon today? Amen. Oh
[1:29:34] my.
[1:29:36] Okay.
[1:29:38] He's trying to tell them the first
[1:29:40] thing, get it out of your mind that you
[1:29:43] are going to get lost
[1:29:45] and you are going to do this and you are
[1:29:47] going h you you are scared of this.
[1:29:50] Don't be scared of nothing for he's
[1:29:53] trying to tell you where you are at, who
[1:29:56] you are, and how you are standing.
[1:30:00] Oh my, I feel like shouting hallelujah.
[1:30:04] Amen. Yes. He's trying to tell you who
[1:30:06] you are, where you are, and how you are
[1:30:08] standing. How are you standing this
[1:30:10] morning?
[1:30:15] Now, you might do things that are wrong
[1:30:19] and every time you do anything wrong,
[1:30:22] you are going to get paid for it. Yes,
[1:30:24] sir. You will reap what you sow, but
[1:30:28] that has nothing to do with your
[1:30:31] salvation.
[1:30:34] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:30:36] Oh my
[1:30:41] I I can I can do this. I can
[1:30:45] Yeah.
[1:30:47] If you do wrong, the prophet says you
[1:30:50] will pay for it.
[1:30:52] Yeah. Hello.
[1:30:56] Hello. Amen. Yeah.
[1:30:59] There was a brother I I I don't have
[1:31:02] time to read everything. Yeah. He said,
[1:31:04] "Ah, I'm tired. I'll start drinking."
[1:31:08] Yeah. How many knows the story? Yeah.
[1:31:13] So, he bought himself a case of beer.
[1:31:16] Yeah. To enjoy himself. What happened?
[1:31:20] Because he had the representation. Amen.
[1:31:23] Amen. Yeah. God could not allow him. So
[1:31:27] what happened? God had to take him away.
[1:31:39] That shows where you can be once you are
[1:31:42] inside there. Amen. And you have your
[1:31:44] representation.
[1:31:46] Yeah. God cannot allow his
[1:31:49] representation to get lost. Amen.
[1:31:55] Oh my God. Help us. Amen. Church, let us
[1:32:00] wake up. Let us know where we are now.
[1:32:04] We are going home. We are soon leaving
[1:32:08] this world. Where are we now? We are
[1:32:10] soon going home. So, who are you?
[1:32:14] I'm a child of God.
[1:32:17] I'm a child of God.
[1:32:20] Amen.
[1:32:22] Oh my.
[1:32:23] God help us. God help us.
[1:32:28] Oh yes.
[1:32:30] God can never lose you.
[1:32:35] If you are his
[1:32:37] Oh yes. What happened to the prodical
[1:32:40] son? He was always the child's father.
[1:32:46] Regardless of what he did, we say it
[1:32:48] here last time that when he came to
[1:32:51] himself, So all the things he was doing,
[1:32:55] he was not himself.
[1:32:57] So all the things you are doing is not
[1:32:59] is because you are not yourself. But
[1:33:02] when you come to yourself, who is
[1:33:04] yourself? You are representation.
[1:33:07] The charm of life. Amen.
[1:33:11] Thank you. The charm of life. Is your
[1:33:15] representation. Amen. Oh yes. Yes. When
[1:33:18] you come to yourself, Lord, open my eyes
[1:33:21] of understanding. Let me know who I am.
[1:33:25] Who I am, let me know who I am. Yes.
[1:33:28] This morning. Amen. Amen. That's the
[1:33:31] reason we are preaching this subject.
[1:33:34] For the church to know who she is, what
[1:33:37] happens once the church knows who she
[1:33:40] is. Yeah. The rapture takes place.
[1:33:45] Once the church knows who she is, the
[1:33:48] rapture takes place.
[1:33:50] So who is holding the rapture?
[1:33:56] God open my eyes.
[1:33:59] Oh my God help us. Church, let us wake
[1:34:04] up.
[1:34:06] The time for playing the church is over.
[1:34:11] Yeah.
[1:34:17] But hell is against this.
[1:34:20] Hell is against this. Why? Because hell
[1:34:25] knows once you catch that revelation.
[1:34:29] The prophet says, "What happens when you
[1:34:31] put together?"
[1:34:33] Yeah. Those people with their revelation
[1:34:36] who have caught the revelation, you put
[1:34:38] them together. If God can put us
[1:34:40] together, each one of us with a
[1:34:42] revelation
[1:34:43] of who you are, oh yes, God help us. May
[1:34:48] God help me. Amen. God help me. Start
[1:34:52] with me. Amen. Amen.
[1:34:57] Oh yes. Like that girl who was putting
[1:35:00] them in institution
[1:35:03] when the prophet went there. Yeah.
[1:35:07] And he started pray before he started
[1:35:09] praying this girl went to the prophet
[1:35:11] and said, "Can you start with me?"
[1:35:15] Yeah. I I wish we could get to that
[1:35:18] point.
[1:35:20] Lord, start with me. Amen. Yeah. Amen.
[1:35:25] Start with me.
[1:35:27] I I don't know about my neighbor. Yeah.
[1:35:30] Lord, start with me. It is me who needs
[1:35:34] you. It is me who needs that revelation.
[1:35:37] Lord, start with me. Open my eyes. I
[1:35:40] need you, Lord. I need you. Open my
[1:35:43] eyes.
[1:35:47] Oh my.
[1:35:50] Oh yes.
[1:35:52] So, as long as you are, as long as God
[1:35:57] has met you,
[1:36:00] I'm not talking to those outside of
[1:36:03] Christ. I'm talking to those that that
[1:36:07] are in.
[1:36:10] How do you get in Christ? By one spirit,
[1:36:15] capital S, which means by one Holy
[1:36:19] Spirit, we are all baptized into one
[1:36:23] body. Amen. How do we get in? By water
[1:36:27] baptism? No. Amen.
[1:36:30] How disagreeable am I with you Baptist
[1:36:33] and you church of Christ? Not by water
[1:36:36] baptism. By no means. 1 Corinthians 12
[1:36:41] say, "By one spirit, Holy Spirit, are we
[1:36:45] brought into that body." Now, if the
[1:36:49] Holy Spirit is the one that baptizes you
[1:36:52] into that mystical body, how important
[1:36:55] it is. Oh, yeah.
[1:36:59] God help us. Amen.
[1:37:04] If it is that so important,
[1:37:08] how can we substitute it with something
[1:37:10] else?
[1:37:13] How
[1:37:15] how do we substitute it with something
[1:37:17] else with church membership?
[1:37:20] Oh, I belong to restored word
[1:37:22] fellowship.
[1:37:24] How does that help you? Amen. Yeah.
[1:37:28] We are talking about you are here and
[1:37:31] you are in the mystical body
[1:37:35] of Jesus Christ.
[1:37:37] Yeah. You have been baptized into that
[1:37:40] body.
[1:37:42] Now inside there there is no danger of
[1:37:46] falling.
[1:37:51] Oh my what an assurance.
[1:37:54] Can we get there?
[1:37:56] Can we
[1:37:58] friends? Can we? Can we?
[1:38:03] Oh, let me hear from you. Can we
[1:38:08] inside there? Not around there,
[1:38:12] but inside there. Oh yeah. Is where you
[1:38:15] now you can sing that song. There is no
[1:38:18] danger of falling.
[1:38:20] Amen.
[1:38:23] Oh
[1:38:24] my.
[1:38:27] Amen.
[1:38:30] How did he choose us before the
[1:38:34] foundation of the world? When his great
[1:38:37] hidden mystery, his great secret, he
[1:38:40] chose us in Christ before the foundation
[1:38:43] of the world. That we should be holy and
[1:38:46] without blame before him in what? in
[1:38:48] love, having what predestinated us unto
[1:38:52] the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[1:38:56] to himself.
[1:38:59] Oh my,
[1:39:02] I said this in uh let's preach last
[1:39:04] Sunday. Sometimes
[1:39:08] if you are a carpenter or whatever,
[1:39:12] when you are making something for the
[1:39:14] customer, you want to make it so
[1:39:15] perfect.
[1:39:17] Yeah. Why? You are valuing what you'll
[1:39:21] be paid by the customer. But when it
[1:39:24] comes to something that is of your own.
[1:39:27] Yeah.
[1:39:30] Sometimes you take corners.
[1:39:32] As long as it is a as long as it is a
[1:39:35] sofa.
[1:39:37] Yeah. After all, I I'm the one who will
[1:39:40] be sitting on it. Yeah.
[1:39:43] You value the customer
[1:39:46] but not yourself,
[1:39:49] but not Christ.
[1:39:51] Yeah,
[1:39:53] he's doing it all for himself.
[1:40:00] And that's why he's preparing a church
[1:40:04] without spot
[1:40:07] or wrinkle.
[1:40:10] Why? because it is for himself.
[1:40:14] Now this restoration we are talking
[1:40:16] about it is back to himself.
[1:40:21] The scripture where we read in Genesis
[1:40:24] 1:28. Yeah. We can see that Eve was
[1:40:29] inside Adam. Amen. Now if she had
[1:40:34] remained in Adam, there was no danger of
[1:40:37] falling. Amen. The danger came by
[1:40:40] separation.
[1:40:43] Now if you stay separated from Adam,
[1:40:48] you cannot say there is no danger of
[1:40:50] falling. There is danger of falling.
[1:40:53] So today for there not to be a fall.
[1:40:57] Hallelujah.
[1:40:59] For there not to be a fall then we must
[1:41:02] be restored back. Amen. If must be
[1:41:06] restored back in Adam. Amen.
[1:41:10] Where Adam was told, yeah, it was he,
[1:41:16] them, male and female. Amen. Yeah. Then
[1:41:21] he was told you can have dominion.
[1:41:25] [Laughter]
[1:41:27] Oh my. You can now you can have
[1:41:31] dominion.
[1:41:33] Amen. Yeah.
[1:41:34] over the force of the air, all the
[1:41:37] creatures in the sea,
[1:41:40] every living creature, you can have
[1:41:42] dominion.
[1:41:45] That can only happen.
[1:41:48] Yeah. Amen. When that restoration has
[1:41:51] taken place, Amen.
[1:41:53] where Eve has been restored back into
[1:41:57] Adam.
[1:41:59] Then we can say Christ and the bride are
[1:42:03] one. Amen. Amen.
[1:42:06] Now, amen. Paul
[1:42:10] as much as in Ephesians he's addressing
[1:42:13] to those who are in Christ,
[1:42:16] but in Corinthians he said, "I have
[1:42:18] espoused you to one husband, but I fear
[1:42:23] Yeah.
[1:42:26] Now Paul with all the revelation that he
[1:42:30] had now he's telling the Corinthians,
[1:42:32] "Yes, I have I have espoused you to one
[1:42:35] husband, but I fear."
[1:42:38] Yeah.
[1:42:45] Oh my.
[1:42:48] Oh yes,
[1:42:51] Paul is saying I fear.
[1:42:56] But when it comes to the prophet
[1:42:59] in the message invisible union in that
[1:43:03] message, the prophet says it was a
[1:43:07] thanksgiving sermon. Hallelujah.
[1:43:12] Thanksgiving and you are talking about
[1:43:14] invisible union. How does it match?
[1:43:17] Yeah.
[1:43:18] The prophet was thanking God for the
[1:43:21] invisible union.
[1:43:26] So he could not say like Paul that I
[1:43:29] fear. That's good. No, you didn't get
[1:43:34] it.
[1:43:35] Paul said, "Yes, I have espoused you to
[1:43:38] one husband." Who is the husband?
[1:43:40] Christ. But I fear. Yes.
[1:43:43] But when it comes to the prophet, he's
[1:43:46] pre he's preaching a thanksgiving
[1:43:49] sermon.
[1:43:51] Thanking God for what? For the invisible
[1:43:54] union. Why? The marriage has taken
[1:43:58] place.
[1:44:01] Amen.
[1:44:02] Now he's let's put it this way. He's he
[1:44:05] was the only marriage officer who could
[1:44:09] announce the engagement.
[1:44:12] Yeah. And also pronounce the marriage.
[1:44:16] And that's why he was thanking God for
[1:44:19] the invisible union. Amen. Did you get
[1:44:23] it my
[1:44:28] Yeah.
[1:44:29] Paul was afraid.
[1:44:32] But the prophet says this was a
[1:44:34] thanksgiving
[1:44:36] message. Amen. Thanking God for what?
[1:44:39] for the invisible union. So he conducted
[1:44:44] he announced the engagement.
[1:44:47] Yeah. And also pronounced the marriage.
[1:44:56] Oh my. What a message we have.
[1:45:01] What a message we have. Hallelujah. The
[1:45:05] marriage is on.
[1:45:08] Amen. The marriage is own. Lord.
[1:45:14] Oh,
[1:45:16] praise God.
[1:45:18] Oh my goodness.
[1:45:22] Amen.
[1:45:25] Okay.
[1:45:29] Amen.
[1:45:32] If you can just be a member of this
[1:45:34] pride, then you have met it.
[1:45:42] No, you didn't get it.
[1:45:45] If only you can be a member of this
[1:45:48] body, then you have made it. Praise God.
[1:45:54] Oh yes. How do you become a member? By
[1:45:57] one spirit we are baptized into. Amen.
[1:46:04] Oh my.
[1:46:06] Praise God. If only you can be a member.
[1:46:12] Lord, help me to be a member. Amen. Pass
[1:46:16] me not, oh general savior. Hear my
[1:46:18] humble cry.
[1:46:20] Let me unite myself now. Let me unite
[1:46:24] with the word. Let me become the word.
[1:46:27] Let me become the word. Lord, pass me
[1:46:30] not. Oh general savior, hear my humble
[1:46:32] cry. Amen.
[1:46:35] Holy Spirit baptize me into that body.
[1:46:39] Oh yes.
[1:46:41] So when it comes to that point that's
[1:46:44] why the prophet preached the message
[1:46:45] desperation.
[1:46:48] You become desperate.
[1:46:50] When you are desperate Yeah. When you
[1:46:54] are desperate
[1:46:56] you become so serious.
[1:46:59] God bless you my brother. When you are
[1:47:01] desperate. Yeah. you become so serious.
[1:47:05] Yeah. It will be more than just entering
[1:47:08] that door and sitting down.
[1:47:11] Yeah.
[1:47:13] It will be more than that.
[1:47:16] When you become desperate.
[1:47:19] Oh yes. When you become desperate,
[1:47:23] Lord, create more thirst in me.
[1:47:27] Create more hunger in me. Just create
[1:47:30] more hunger in me.
[1:47:32] Let me let me stop the game of playing
[1:47:36] church.
[1:47:38] Yeah. Lord help us. Help us, Lord.
[1:47:43] Yeah. He has been so good to you.
[1:47:47] He has been so good to you. Thank you,
[1:47:49] sister. He has been so good to you. How?
[1:47:52] Yes, he has. By bringing you to church
[1:47:54] so that you can listen about this
[1:47:56] mystery.
[1:47:57] Yeah. He's so much concerned with you.
[1:48:00] Amen.
[1:48:03] That's why he does good things for you.
[1:48:06] He makes he creates some hunger and
[1:48:10] thirst in you to go and listen.
[1:48:16] Amen. God help us.
[1:48:20] God help us.
[1:48:22] Amen.
[1:48:25] Oh my
[1:48:30] adoption is the gathering of Eve or the
[1:48:33] church back into Christ the headstone.
[1:48:38] And according to Zachchariah, the
[1:48:41] headstone came down crying grace, grace,
[1:48:46] grace.
[1:48:48] Oh yes. Yes. So we can now sing Amazing
[1:48:52] Grace because grace grace came down.
[1:48:59] Grace came down.
[1:49:03] Have you seen grace?
[1:49:06] Do you know grace?
[1:49:09] Grace who?
[1:49:13] Have you seen grace?
[1:49:16] Yeah.

[1:49:25] Grace found me. Amen. Oh yes.
[1:49:30] Oh my. He lifted me up from the mar. Who
[1:49:34] lifted you up? Grace.
[1:49:38] It is grace.
[1:49:40] Yeah. It is grace. Yeah. Amen. There is
[1:49:46] a song we used to sing in
[1:49:51] I think it's in English. He will gather
[1:49:53] he will gather the chew wells. Now
[1:49:56] gathering the jewels is not the way the
[1:50:00] caterpillar push grabs everything. H and
[1:50:04] no no no no no it's speaking.
[1:50:07] It is speaking. Yeah it is speaking.
[1:50:12] Yeah. Oh yes. Why is he why why is he
[1:50:16] picking? Because you have a
[1:50:18] representation.
[1:50:21] So it is that representation.
[1:50:23] Yeah. It is that representation that is
[1:50:26] coming for you. Amen. Oh my. In that
[1:50:31] representation, it is that
[1:50:32] representation. And that's why the
[1:50:34] prophet says we are hearing from our
[1:50:37] theophanes. Amen. Our representation is
[1:50:41] the one that is speaking to you now.

[1:52:48] Praise God. We're adopted. Amen. Sons
[1:52:51] and daughters of God. You wonder why we
[1:52:54] preach the Holy Ghost so much. We've got
[1:52:57] the life of God inside of us.
[1:53:02] Hallelujah. That's what it is. That's
[1:53:03] what the Holy Ghost is.
[1:53:06] The life of God, the seed of God on the
[1:53:10] inside of you. We've got representation.
[1:53:14] How many have that representation?
[1:53:16] But we've got to surrender our life to
[1:53:19] him. Let's sing it again. I surrender
[1:53:22] all.

[1:53:45] savior
[1:53:47] I surrender
[1:53:51] all.
[1:53:53] Amen. Let's sing that song. He abides.
[1:53:57] Amen. But you know before we sing that
[1:54:00] song, can we all lift our hands and say,
[1:54:03] Lord, I surrender all.
[1:54:06] Amen.
[1:54:08] Maybe he wants you to surrender your
[1:54:10] bank account. I don't know.
[1:54:13] But it's not about money. He wants to
[1:54:16] have all of you.
[1:54:19] Amen. Not your not just your living
[1:54:22] room. He wants all of you. That's what
[1:54:26] he's interested. Amen. But we can
[1:54:29] rejoice. We're children of God. He knew
[1:54:31] us before the foundation of the world.
[1:54:34] Amen. By for now, he predestinated you
[1:54:39] that you cannot fall. Amen. Can we hear
[1:54:43] it? Amen. You cannot fall if you are in
[1:54:46] Christ Jesus. We heard it this morning.
[1:54:49] And that's what the message is all
[1:54:51] about. You cannot fall. We are on the
[1:54:54] inside of him. Amen. So, let's rejoice
[1:54:58] this morning. Thank you, Lord.
[1:54:59] Hallelujah. I'm I'm rejoicing night and
[1:55:04] day as I'm on the pilgrim way for the
[1:55:08] hand of God in all my
[1:55:13] reason.
[1:55:16] The secret all is that the comforter
[1:55:19] abides with me.
[1:55:23] He abides.
[1:55:26] He abides.
[1:55:28] Oh hallelujah. He abides with me.
[1:55:34] I'm rejoicing
[1:55:36] as I walk away for the comfort of my
[1:55:43] [Music]
[1:55:45] heart of sin. Once I had no peace within
[1:55:50] till I heard how Jesus died upon a tree.
[1:55:55] Oh, and I fell down at his feet. And
[1:55:58] there came a piece of me
[1:56:01] [Music]
[1:56:03] with
[1:56:08] [Music]
[1:56:11] hallelujah.
[1:56:12] [Music]
[1:56:19] As I walk there away
[1:56:24] with me,
[1:56:27] he is with me everywhere.
[1:56:31] Hallelujah. I'm happy as a
[1:56:36] free
[1:56:38] for the spirit has
[1:56:41] a sacrifice
[1:56:44] around
[1:56:46] that singing. abides. He abides.
[1:56:52] He abides. Hallelujah. He abides with
[1:56:57] me.
[1:56:59] I'm rejoicing night.
[1:57:03] The narrow way for the comforter abides
[1:57:07] with me.
[1:57:09] There's no thirsting. The things of the
[1:57:13] world they take away. Long ago I gave
[1:57:16] them up and instantly
[1:57:20] all my
[1:57:23] burdens away. Now the comforter abides
[1:57:28] with me. He abides. He abides. He
[1:57:32] abides. He
[1:57:35] abides. Hallelujah. He abides me.
[1:57:41] Rejoice night and tears of block and air
[1:57:45] away
[1:57:47] comforter. Abide with me.
[1:57:52] Does he abide with you? Amen. Do you
[1:57:55] have the Holy Ghost since you believed?
[1:57:58] Amen. We've heard the message, but have
[1:58:00] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:58:02] believed? That's the question. Amen.
[1:58:04] Hallelujah. Praise God. We're so happy.
[1:58:07] Amen. We can sing hallelujah. Amen. Can
[1:58:10] you say it? Can you say hallelujah?
[1:58:12] Hallelujah. Can you say praise the Lord
[1:58:15] that I'm redeemed? We've been bought
[1:58:17] back. Amen. Hallelujah. He paid a big
[1:58:20] price, but he paid he he he paid it all.
[1:58:24] Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. Too bad
[1:58:28] it's the close of another service, isn't
[1:58:29] it? Hallelujah.
[1:58:32] Not Hallelujah. Amen. We're happy that,
[1:58:35] you know, we were able to hear God's
[1:58:37] word today. Thank you. Thank you,
[1:58:39] brother Gilbert, for yielding to the
[1:58:41] Lord and Amen. giving us what we needed
[1:58:44] today. I needed it. Amen. I needed to be
[1:58:48] reminded I cannot fall away.
[1:58:52] Sometimes you get to a position, you
[1:58:54] know, you're a believer to 20, 30 years,
[1:58:57] but you know, you come to a position,
[1:58:58] the devil says, well, do you really have
[1:59:01] it? Is that right? Are you really inside
[1:59:05] of the body of Jesus Christ? But we
[1:59:08] heard today the word of God says we are
[1:59:11] in the body and we can't fall away.
[1:59:15] Isn't that a wonderful message?
[1:59:18] God has looked after our future sins.
[1:59:22] Even what we you will do wrong tomorrow.
[1:59:25] He's looked after it. The blood covers
[1:59:28] it all. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:59:32] Amen. Can we sing? Going to stay right
[1:59:35] under the blood. Can we sing now?
[1:59:41] I'm going to stay the right.

[1:59:58] [Music]

[2:00:04] No harm.
[2:00:07] No,
[2:00:10] no,
[2:00:13] no.
[2:00:15] I'm going to sing right under the
[2:00:21] saw this world
[2:00:24] to me.

[2:01:07] so this world can do me no harm.
