TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Let's go pray each one to the Lord as spoken to us this morning. Speak to him, Lord. If you have been, if you're already born again, thank God. Say, Lord, fill me with more, more love, more than nature, till I come to the earth. You're still struggling, it's not the end yet. The fact that you still have that desire in your heart that shows that God is still you son of God just want that se to be expressed not in a feeling maybe you might not even feel anything today but as you press on that same desire that same tag inside of you the one who started the work before the foundation of the world will bring it full expression, full manifestation. Just yield yourself. Tell him, "Lord, I want more of the Holy Ghost. Lord, I want you to be expressed through me. I want the part of you. I want the portion of the scripture. I want the portion of the word, Father, for my day to be expressed. I want the attribute of God in me to be manifested. Lord, I love you. Lord, I obey you. Lord, I I'm determined to serve you. Lord, I want father to be separated from from the things of the world. And I want the love of God to take over. I don't want to love the things of the world, the things of the flesh, but I want you, Father, to have the Father. You see the desire in my heart is more of you. Speak to your Lord this morning. Father, Lord, I accept your word. I believe your word in my flesh. I can't even do it myself, but Father, I accept your word. I believe your word like Abraham. I just believe your word. Father, may you come and bring the change, the transformation from the inside out. What I desire. But I will I will try my best to confirm myself to the word of God to be obedient. But Father, you know in my flesh I will fail. If there is no power of the Holy Ghost to take over, to transform me from the inside out. Oh God, may you come in a special way. May you come and move. May you, Father, Lord, move me. Put the man aside. Lord, I accept you. Accept your word. Father, transform me. Change me. Change my heart. Change my desire. Oh Lord, may you have the God. Father, may you the omnipotence of God come and take over. Shadow me with the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; that I might give birth to Christ and let Christ grow deeper and higher, stronger in me, Lord. Father, I'll pray each morning. I'll pray each day. I'll read my Bible, but let the dynamic of God comes, Father Lord, to quicken the mechanic. Oh, Father Lord, I don't want to be just a church member. I don't want to be like a lukewarm Christian. I don't want just father to live from session from emotion to emotion. I want the reality of Jesus Christ. I want father person of Christ. I want the relationship a fellowship with you Lord every day. Oh Lord, that's my desire. Change my heart Lord. Bring me to that place where I'm hidden Lord in the inner chamber having Lord the relationship. Move me in a higher place. Oh Lord, thank you for your word. Thank you for your word that came this morning. Father, accept it in my heart. I receive my heart. I receive it in my heart. Lord, let it be made life in me. Let the Holy Spirit come and quicken the word of God that have received. But Lord, we have received the full word, the restored word, Father, so that we can have a restored fellowship with you. Not just, Lord, Lord, not like a a boyfriend or girlfriend, oh father, not like a sympaizer, but you bring us Lord to a marriage relationship with you. That's why all the loose hand has been restored in the word of God. The message of the hour. Lord, I want to grow deeper. I want to go higher. I want the life of Jesus Christ. I want the literal life. Oh Lord Jesus. Oh father, visit us in our little church. Restored word fellowship. fellowship based upon the restored word of God, the full restoration of the word of God. Move among us, Father. Remember the heads of home, the mothers, oh Father, bring us Lord, bring us to the place, the place where we know you the way we have been known, even to know ourselves the way we have been known. Make this church and strong word of God, full obedience of the word of God and the love of God just taking over, Father, where we have love for one another, united in faith, believing the word of God, trusting in you, Lord, believing in the miraculous, Lord, where the signs and wonders being fulfilled among us, Father. Lord, move in a spiritual way. We don't want to limit you, Lord. We won't want to put you in a box. Father, we want to tap in those un unlimited resources, those untapped resources of the word of God. Help us to dig deeper, Lord. Father, Father, I'm tired of lukewarm religious. I'm tired, Father, of pushing from the outside. I desire something. Oh God, I pray something deep inside. Lord, I love you more as Pastor Zeke prayed on Wednesday. Lord, just I want you more, Father.
