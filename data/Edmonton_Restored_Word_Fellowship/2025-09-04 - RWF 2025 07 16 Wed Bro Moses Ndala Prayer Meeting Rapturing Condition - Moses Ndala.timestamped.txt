[10:15] to be in service tonight.
[10:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Welcome to the service. May the
[10:20] Lord bless us together. He placed upon
[10:23] me. He placed me upon the strong rock by
[10:27] his side. Is that right, Brother Len? Is
[10:29] that wonderful?
[10:30] &gt;&gt; Is that wonderful, Brother Len? Amen.
[10:34] And maybe you don't hear me. Amen. My
[10:38] steps were established

[11:32] Oh, step into the water.
[11:36] Wait out a little bit deeper.
[11:40] Come join angels singing praises to the
[11:44] lamb of God. It's time we the people
[11:49] stand up for what is right. It's time we
[11:54] squared our shoulders back and raised
[11:57] our swords to fight. For the Bible is
[12:01] our weapon and the spirit is our shield.
[12:06] The church needs more of its members to
[12:09] be workers in his field. Oh, step into
[12:14] the water.

[12:36] lamb of God. There's victory for the
[12:40] Christian who walks the narrow way.
[12:45] There have been a prize appointed for
[12:48] the soul who does not stray. Oh, I want
[12:52] to live for Jesus. be all that I should
[12:57] be so that I can rest with him forever
[13:01] and live eternally.

[13:22] bit deeper.
[13:24] Come join angels singing praises to the
[13:28] lamb of God.
[13:45] If you just stand with mead
[13:50] morning when this life is over, I'll
[13:56] fly away
[14:00] to a home on God's celestial shore.
[14:05] I'll
[14:07] fly away.
[14:11] I'll
[14:13] fly away. Oh, glory.
[14:17] I'll
[14:19] fly away.
[14:22] I won't die. Hallelujah. By and by,
[14:28] I'll
[14:30] fly away.
[14:34] When the shadows of this life have
[14:38] grown,
[14:39] I'll
[14:42] fly away
[14:45] like a bird from prison. Bars have
[14:49] flown.
[14:51] I'll
[14:53] fly away.
[14:57] I'll
[14:59] fly away. Oh, glory.
[15:02] I'll
[15:04] fly away.
[15:08] I won't die. Hallelujah. By and by,
[15:13] I
[15:15] fly away.
[15:19] Just a few more weary days and then I'll
[15:27] fly away
[15:30] to a land where joy shall never end.
[15:36] I'll
[15:38] fly away.
[15:41] I'll
[15:43] fly away. Oh glory. I
[15:49] fly away.
[15:52] I won't die. Hallelujah. By and by,
[15:58] I'll
[16:00] fly away. Just a few,
[16:03] just a few more weary days. And then
[16:09] I
[16:11] fly away
[16:14] to a land where joy shall never end.
[16:20] I'll
[16:22] fly away.
[16:25] I'll
[16:27] fly away. Oh glory I
[16:33] fly away.
[16:36] I won't die. Hallelujah. By and by
[16:42] I'll
[16:44] fly away.
[16:47] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[16:51] And just as a I guess a testimony, we've
[16:55] been praying for brother Steven had in
[16:59] Montana on his bike and I only know a
[17:01] little bit. So, he was riding around a
[17:04] curve at about highway speed and a patch
[17:07] of gravel and sand
[17:10] him slid
[17:13] slid off his bike, hit the guard rail,
[17:15] got ejected from his bike onto the
[17:20] heard
[17:22] rail.
[17:25] So, the Lord kept him through all that
[17:27] he's home.
[17:29] And now he's
[17:31] going
[17:32] couple appointments to see what
[17:36] he's recovering. So
[17:40] maybe we'll just bow with
[17:46] Lord. Heavenly Father, we thank you Lord
[17:50] for this opportunity Lord to be in your
[17:51] house. Lord Lord the grace Lord you've

[20:29] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[20:33] the pilgrim way for the hand of God in
[20:37] all my life I see
[20:40] and the reason of my bliss. Yes. The
[20:44] secret all is this that the comforter
[20:47] abides in me.

[21:05] the pilgrim way. For the comforter
[21:09] abides with me.
[21:12] Once my heart was full of sin. Once I
[21:16] had no peace within, till I heard how
[21:19] Jesus died upon the tree.
[21:23] Then I fell down at his feet. And there
[21:26] came a peace so sweet. Now the comforter
[21:30] abides with me.

[21:58] every care. I'm as happy as a burden,
[22:02] just as free
[22:05] for the spirit control. Jesus satisfies
[22:09] my soul since the comforter abides with
[22:13] me.
[22:15] He abides.
[22:18] He abides.
[22:21] Hallelujah. He abides with me.
[22:26] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[22:29] the narrow way. For the comforter abides
[22:34] with me.
[22:36] There's no thirsting for the things of
[22:39] the world. They've taken wings. Long ago
[22:42] I gave them up and instantly.
[22:46] All my night was turned to day. All my
[22:50] burdens rolled away. Now the comforter
[22:53] abides with me.
[22:57] He abides.
[22:59] He abides.
[23:02] Hallelujah. He abides with me.

[23:11] the narrow way. For the comforter abides
[23:15] with me.
[23:17] He is with me everywhere and he knows my
[23:21] every care. I'm as happy as a bird, just
[23:25] as free.
[23:28] For the spirit has control. Jesus
[23:31] satisfies my soul. For the comforter
[23:35] abides with me.
[23:38] He abides.
[23:41] He abides.
[23:43] Hallelujah. He abides with me.

[23:52] the narrow way. For the comforter abides
[23:56] with me.

[38:47] says Even thus shall it be in the day
[38:51] when the son of man is revealed. So it
[38:54] gives out the symptoms and the things
[38:56] that happening in time of Noah, things
[38:58] that happened in the time of Lot or
[39:01] which was also the time of Abraham and
[39:04] then he compared that to the time we are
[39:06] living in when the son of man is being
[39:08] revealed. Then he gives a parable in 18
[39:12] just after that gives a parable of 18.
[39:15] He says as he spoke a parable unto them
[39:18] to this to this end that man ought
[39:21] always to pray and not to faint.
[39:25] So it's a prayer meeting today. It says
[39:28] saying there was in a city a judge which
[39:31] feared not God neither regarded man. And
[39:34] there was a widow in that city. She came
[39:36] unto him, saying, "Avenge me of mine
[39:39] adversary." And he would not for a
[39:41] while. But afterward he said within
[39:44] himself, "Though I fear not God, nor
[39:47] regard men, yet because this widow
[39:50] troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by
[39:53] her continual coming she wear me." And
[39:57] the Lord said, "Hear what the unjust
[40:00] judge saith. And shall not God avenge
[40:03] his own elect which cry day and night
[40:06] unto him, though he bear he bear long
[40:10] with them? I tell you that he will
[40:13] avenge them speedily.
[40:16] Nevertheless, when the Son of Man
[40:18] cometh, shall he find faith on the
[40:21] earth. Amen. May God bless his word and
[40:24] have a seat.
[40:32] We should never be wary of of praying.
[40:36] Should never say no, I've already prayed
[40:38] enough. Already mentioned that to God.
[40:40] So that I will not repeat that again.
[40:42] But God likes to hear our prayers. Amen.
[40:45] God likes to enjoy our prayers. And then
[40:47] whenever we say that, never give up.
[40:49] Continue to knock. Continue to knock on
[40:51] the door. Lord, you know I need. Lord,
[40:54] you know my situation. I keep knocking
[40:55] on the door. And the prophet says, Not a
[40:58] simple knock is a continual knock.
[41:00] Continue knocking. And the one who
[41:02] knocks it will be open to him. And if
[41:04] the unjust will just the unjust was was
[41:08] answering to the prayer of that widow
[41:10] even though he was not fearing God, how
[41:12] much more God will answer to the prayer
[41:14] of his own elect. The Bible says his own
[41:18] elect means himself has elected those.
[41:20] Himself has made a choice. How can't he
[41:23] put some time to answer to this to the
[41:26] prayer of those who cry unto him? Is the
[41:28] same God today who knows our needs, who
[41:32] knows, he knows our situation, who knows
[41:34] our condition, and he's there to answer
[41:36] to our prayer. Amen.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; So never give up on praying Lord. Never
[41:40] give up on praying on your family. Never
[41:42] give up on praying on your situation.
[41:44] Never never give up on God. God is not
[41:47] tired. Amen. God is actually happy and
[41:50] he will answer even though God is has a
[41:53] certain principles and know sometimes he
[41:55] knows the needs but he just want to hear
[41:57] from you that you can express that need
[42:00] to you know sometimes God you know after
[42:03] the resurrection when he came to the
[42:04] disciples he looked like he was about to
[42:06] go a certain way even though himself
[42:09] desired to reveal to his disciples but
[42:12] he did like he was going to go away then
[42:15] the disciple had to stop master why
[42:17] can't you spend a moment with us. Then
[42:21] he he solded that desire and then he
[42:23] respond to that desire and he revealed
[42:25] himself in a greater way. So God likes
[42:28] to be stopped. Amen.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; How many want to stop God?
[42:32] &gt;&gt; God I want to stop you. Amen.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; As a as a batimus the blind Batimir God.
[42:37] Oh son of David here
[42:40] son son of them have mercy upon me. The
[42:43] same voice of of of the same faith of in
[42:47] Batimirus stopped the son of God. Amen.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Prophet will take that in that message
[42:52] says you know he was he was thinking
[42:54] about what his mother told him about
[42:56] Joshua. Joshua had to stop the son the
[42:59] natural son. Now him had to stop the the
[43:02] the son of God. Amen. The s o n of God.
[43:06] Praise be to God.
[43:09] I would like to go a little bit on a
[43:10] thought and we had said that we had a
[43:12] wonderful message and brother um
[43:17] brother brother Daily preached a message
[43:19] and I had to accompany me to to to
[43:22] manifested word and sprove there to
[43:25] preach on the evening and he preached
[43:27] another good message and I was thinking
[43:29] oh I'll be good some some of the
[43:31] messages I that maybe he preached he
[43:33] will preach maybe one of the messages
[43:35] that he preached here and I will hear it
[43:37] again and sometimes you hear a message
[43:39] and few things still passes you over and
[43:42] I was going there I will hear it again
[43:44] and he went there and he preached a
[43:46] different message completely different
[43:47] message and it was as good as the
[43:50] messages that he preach here amen and
[43:52] some of the thoughts were kind of
[43:54] parallel of what I was thinking to talk
[43:56] about so I didn't want you to miss that
[43:59] as well so I might go to some of the
[44:01] thought that he shared over there and
[44:03] just to put it together and what uh I
[44:06] also wanted to see to share with you uh
[44:09] in few minutes. Amen. I have 20 minutes.
[44:11] I'll try to speed up on that. Amen. Are
[44:13] you with me this evening?
[44:15] &gt;&gt; I'll try to condense something of one
[44:17] hour into 20 minutes. So I would like to
[44:20] talk a little bit on the rapturing
[44:22] condition. Rapturing condition. Amen.
[44:24] Rapturing condition as the question has
[44:26] been asked. Nevertheless, when the son
[44:28] of man cometh, shall he find faith on
[44:31] the earth? When the son of man comes,
[44:34] he's not interested to see other so many
[44:37] other things. He's interested to see one
[44:39] important thing. His own faith. Can he
[44:42] find the faith of God on the earth? He's
[44:45] not asking to the cosmos. Not asking to
[44:47] the other unbelievers. He's asking to
[44:49] the true believers. Because even this
[44:51] parable that he gave there, he's talking
[44:53] to his own elect. So according to his
[44:55] own elect, he's asking them a question.
[44:57] When I shall be revealed, when I shall
[44:59] come, can I find? Can you guarantee me
[45:02] that I will find my faith inside of you?
[45:04] Amen. That's the most important thing.
[45:07] The prophet will talk about this
[45:09] condition corruption conditions only in
[45:11] one message. Perfect faith. And I'll
[45:13] just read that sentence quickly so that
[45:15] he gives you the picture. He says, "So
[45:17] when a man lives by faith and walks by
[45:20] faith, I mean substance faith is
[45:23] isolated from the entire world and
[45:26] becomes a new creature in Christ. Amen.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; When you have the substance faith, you
[45:32] are isolated from the world. You don't
[45:34] think like the world you think
[45:35] differently. You have a super sense as
[45:37] we saw last time. You people of the
[45:40] world cannot understand. You cannot
[45:42] understand some of the decisions that
[45:44] you are making because the decisions are
[45:46] not based on the five senses of the
[45:48] flesh, five senses of the mind that
[45:50] based upon the word of God. You see
[45:53] things that they cannot see. Amen.
[45:55] because you have the substance faith a
[45:57] reality of a faith of God and when you
[46:00] have that you are isolated from the
[46:02] world and you become a new creature in
[46:04] Christ he says now then you are getting
[46:07] into bride material in other words means
[46:10] you cannot part you cannot say you are
[46:12] part of the bride if you don't start by
[46:14] the first step of the new creation in
[46:17] Christ you cannot go anywhere without
[46:19] starting by the new birth then he says
[46:21] see you are getting into rapturing ing
[46:24] conditions. So the rapture is not just
[46:27] one event like this. No, the rapture is
[46:30] actually you have to be in that
[46:32] conditions. You have to be you have to
[46:35] be in that in in that in that
[46:37] environment in that atmosphere and then
[46:40] the rapture will happen. Amen. Actually
[46:43] the process as we heard it on the
[46:45] weekend the process of the rapture has
[46:47] already started. Amen. We are already in
[46:49] the cycle of his coming. Amen. We are
[46:52] not waiting for we we are not we are not
[46:54] waiting for for the cycle to start. We
[46:56] are waiting for the departure. Amen.
[46:59] Which will be the climax of his coming.
[47:01] But we are already in the cycle of his
[47:03] coming. If you miss the cycle of the
[47:06] coming there is little hope to be part
[47:08] of that climax of the clim of the coming
[47:10] of the Lord. So we need to get into the
[47:13] rapturing conditions. The world is
[47:16] already in the conditions of being
[47:18] destroyed. Amen. You have to be in the
[47:21] spirit of the end time in order for the
[47:23] destruction of the end time to come. You
[47:25] have to be in the spirit of the rapture
[47:28] in order for the rapture to happen.
[47:30] Amen. Remember, John had to be in the
[47:32] Lord's in the Lord's day. Amen. He had
[47:35] to be in the spirit. He had to get into
[47:36] the spirit in order to see the things
[47:38] that will happen the Lord's day. Amen.
[47:40] The Lord's day is the day of the coming
[47:42] of the Lord. Amen. So, you have to be in
[47:45] the rapturing condition. that he says we
[47:47] are getting into rapturing conditions
[47:50] now. That means for each one of us, not
[47:53] just the pastor, not just the deacons,
[47:56] not just the trustees, that means for
[47:59] the lady, every individuals walks in a
[48:02] world with God alone. Amen.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; You are you have to walk with God alone.
[48:08] It has to become a personal revelation.
[48:11] It have to become a personal walk with
[48:13] God. You cannot rely on the church
[48:16] group. You cannot rely even
[48:19] the the the stamp of the message
[48:21] believers. No, it has to become a
[48:23] personal revelation with God. And we are
[48:26] we are believers here. We all that we
[48:27] know. But it's good to remind that.
[48:29] Amen. He says we are baptized into his
[48:32] kingdom and there is nobody in there but
[48:34] you and God. He gives the orders and you
[48:37] pack them out. Whatever he says there is
[48:40] no there's not a shout of doubt.
[48:43] nowhere. He walks right on. If the Lord
[48:46] says this, there's nobody in the world
[48:48] can talk you out of it. You go right on.
[48:51] That's the same. Now you are getting
[48:53] into perfect faith. Perfect perfection
[48:56] that cannot fail. Amen. That faith never
[48:59] fails. Yes, he was a mystic to them with
[49:02] his perfect faith. And so is it now for
[49:05] those who have perfect faith a mystic to
[49:08] others. Why that mystic to others?
[49:10] because they cannot understand you.
[49:12] Jesus Christ was a mystic to others
[49:15] because he was in the world but he was
[49:18] also in another world. Amen.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; We as a two two beings two two two
[49:23] worlds in one being. One being in two
[49:25] worlds. Let me say one one person in two
[49:28] worlds. Amen. We also here we are in
[49:30] this world but we are not part of this
[49:32] world. Amen. The bride is in the leodia
[49:35] age but is not in Leodia. The bride in
[49:38] last year age, but he's also in the
[49:40] bride age. Amen. In order to be part of
[49:42] the rapture, you have to be in the bride
[49:44] age. Amen. You have to rise up. Come up,
[49:47] John. John, you are the bride. Come up.
[49:49] Amen. You have to get out of the
[49:52] denominations. That's why when the seven
[49:54] sins come, you are not part of the
[49:56] denomination ages is over. Because you
[49:59] cannot think as denominations anymore.
[50:02] You think as God things. Amen. You don't
[50:04] have your own thought anymore. You have
[50:06] God's thoughts now.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; God, may you give us the mind of Christ
[50:10] to think like Christ to to to behave
[50:13] like Christ, to speak like Christ. Amen.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Let it be our desire.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; The more this flesh dies, the more he's
[50:21] taking the preeminence and we want him
[50:24] to have the primance. So the prophet
[50:25] says Jesus lived in a world that nobody
[50:28] else could touch. The disciples couldn't
[50:30] understand him. When he spoke to them
[50:32] they say this they say this and then
[50:35] they said why why you talk in riddles we
[50:38] don't understand how can this say that
[50:40] was not they was not in the world that
[50:43] he lived in he lived in a different
[50:45] world they could not understand him
[50:47] nobody could understand him
[50:51] then the prophet say we are told resist
[50:53] the devil and you will flee from thee to
[50:56] resist is to to to just simply turn him
[50:59] down Just resist him. Just walk away
[51:03] from him. God said a certain thing. No
[51:06] matter what he's trying to tell you, you
[51:08] don't even listen to him. Don't mind the
[51:11] devil. How can you know that he's the
[51:14] devil when he's trying to tell you
[51:16] something that is not confessing the
[51:18] word of God?
[51:19] &gt;&gt; If you are sick and he come say you know
[51:21] you will not you you you will die of it.
[51:24] Who told you you will die like that? I'm
[51:26] already healed. Amen. Amen.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; If he tells you, "No, you are not going
[51:30] to make it. Oh, you are too late. I'm
[51:32] already pregnantated by the word of God.
[51:34] I will make it." Amen.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; You cannot feel it. But I know that
[51:38] something happened in my heart. Of
[51:40] course, I'm not what I ought to be. I'm
[51:42] not what even what I should be, but I
[51:44] know from where I come from. And I know
[51:47] that something has happened in my heart.
[51:49] Why? It is a personal revelation to you.
[51:52] Amen. You can say to the enemy, "Boo
[51:54] devil." Amen.
[51:56] If you want, the devil will never say
[51:58] something to encourage you. Never.
[52:00] Never. He will never quote the word of
[52:03] God in order to encourage you. He always
[52:05] quot the word of God in order to put
[52:07] that inside of you. If you are really a
[52:10] son of God, if you are really a daughter
[52:12] of God, you should do this. You should
[52:14] do this. This Oh, I am a daughter of
[52:16] God. I am a son of God. Why? Because my
[52:19] desires have changed. This flesh can put
[52:22] me down but my desire would always point
[52:25] to God. I want to be like God. I want to
[52:28] behave like God. Amen.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; You walk by your desire towards God.
[52:33] Amen. That's why you are here. So it
[52:36] says yes. So you receive the devil.
[52:39] Don't even listen to him. You your ears
[52:41] are deaf to anything else. What? By what
[52:44] the spirit says. To he that has an ear,
[52:48] that listens, see what the spirit said
[52:49] unto the churches. The one that's got
[52:51] the listening post that catches what the
[52:54] spirit says to the churches. Amen. In
[52:56] other words, you know, you don't listen
[52:58] to the devil because the devil in a
[53:00] certain world, you are in a in a
[53:01] different you are soundproof to what the
[53:04] devil is trying to tell you. Completely
[53:06] cut off of what the devil is telling
[53:08] you. That's actually, you know, the the
[53:10] pastor mentioned it on during the
[53:12] weekend. You have your own millennium.
[53:16] You have your own millennium because the
[53:18] devil is he cannot he cannot catch you
[53:20] anymore. The devil is bound. How can the
[53:24] devil be bound? He's bound by the chain
[53:27] of circumstances. He has no place where
[53:30] he can go through. Amen. He still has
[53:32] the flesh but in the soul he cannot.
[53:34] Amen. Even in your mind you start
[53:36] recognizing no this is not this is only
[53:38] the devil. This is only the enemy.
[53:42] The more you grow, the more you become a
[53:44] Christian, you know sometime even a
[53:45] negative thought can come towards your
[53:47] brother, towards your sister. Oh no, why
[53:49] she doesn't? I think and then you
[53:51] realize, oh no, it's only the devil.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; It's not my sister. It's not my brother.
[53:56] It's only the devil. And there he
[53:58] becomes defeated. Amen.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Very quickly you recognize, oh, I was
[54:03] about to say that. No, no, it's only the
[54:04] devil. It's not my sister. It's not my
[54:06] brother. Oh, we will keep pressing on.
[54:08] Amen.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; I know they love the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; That then the devil has no place where
[54:13] he can work in. That's what will happen
[54:15] in the millennium. But it has already
[54:18] started here.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; We are binding him. We have the power to
[54:22] bind the mamba.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; The the Christian has the power to bind
[54:26] him and to loose him. Amen.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; So we are getting into rapturing
[54:33] conditions and rapturing condition. You
[54:36] cannot go into raptured conditions
[54:38] without faith and perfect faith. Amen.
[54:42] Substance faith. We need that substance
[54:45] faith. That's what the son of man in
[54:47] this age when he's being revealed, he
[54:49] want to see that perfect faith. That
[54:51] substance faith. And that's our prayer
[54:54] this morning. And that substance faith
[54:57] will bring you know where where the
[54:58] substance faith is based. The prophet
[55:00] says the faith is based on forgiveness.
[55:05] Oh, I want to be in that in a rapturing
[55:08] conditions. Is there anything in my
[55:10] heart? Lord, take it away. Is any
[55:13] malice, any grudge, any anger, any
[55:16] bitterness, anything negative, Lord,
[55:19] take it away. put me into that rapturing
[55:22] conditions where there is perfect
[55:24] forgiveness
[55:26] where I understand even my brother and
[55:28] my sister when he's weak when she's weak
[55:31] I can understand her in that condition
[55:33] and help her no rise up let's keep
[55:36] pressing on amen don't stay don't if you
[55:39] fall don't stay don't stay in that
[55:41] stages just rise up and let's continue
[55:44] pressing on
[55:45] &gt;&gt; that's where I desire to be in that
[55:48] rapturing condition amen
[55:50] based on forgiveness.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; As I said, prophet, as I said this
[55:54] morning, the church in the place where
[55:56] we could easily or really see apostolic
[56:00] times moving among us. That's what we
[56:03] all hunger to see apostolic times. It's
[56:06] not the miracles and the wonders and God
[56:09] working mighty. The faith of the people
[56:12] being increased and abounding is not
[56:14] only in the old time of books of acts.
[56:17] It was not actually the book of act of
[56:19] the individuals. It was the book of act
[56:22] of the holy ghost in the individuals. It
[56:24] was not the wonders of brother vanam. It
[56:26] was the holy spirit using brother vanam.
[56:29] But if we can heal our vessels the same
[56:31] way as brother vanam heal his vessels.
[56:33] The same god is going to operate among
[56:36] us. Amen.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; We have the same power to stop again
[56:39] that that bull that wild bull the love
[56:43] of god being expressed. Amen. Amen.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; I said it one time in my my sermons. If
[56:48] the love of God can stop an animal that
[56:51] that have doesn't have a soul, you know,
[56:54] that only have working by instant, how
[56:57] much more the love of God can stop
[56:59] someone who has a soul for anything you
[57:02] could do. If I can express to him the
[57:04] love of God,
[57:06] &gt;&gt; if you love someone, he cannot hurt you.
[57:08] Amen.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you really love them sincerely
[57:11] and and they know that you love them,
[57:13] they can never hurt you.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Love, you can never hurt someone
[57:18] and they cannot hurt you if you really
[57:20] love them.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Brother demonstrated with that person
[57:24] who came, you know, that maniac who came
[57:26] and almost and there was one preacher I
[57:29] said I always like to tell my wife was
[57:33] he was so he was he was making it so
[57:35] funny. He he made it that image that it
[57:38] stays right here says you know I you
[57:40] know you can do to me anything you want
[57:42] you can slap me you can do anything you
[57:45] know I'm a human being you can do to me
[57:47] anything you want but when you get
[57:50] you really take your saliva and you
[57:52] threw it at me no that's too much for me
[57:58] and bra could stand up someone really
[58:02] cry spitting on him wow No.
[58:06] So that always stayed with me because he
[58:09] really did it himself. Know really? So
[58:13] and then to your face. No.
[58:18] Now think about it. If someone does that
[58:20] to you,
[58:22] but the he say I loved him. Even though
[58:25] he did that, I loved him
[58:27] &gt;&gt; and my love was projected on him and he
[58:30] fell on his feet because of the love of
[58:32] God. Amen. Amen.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise be to God. Amen. So
[58:38] rapturing conditions, God has to prepare
[58:41] us in that rapturing conditions. That's
[58:44] why the brother took it a bit in that
[58:46] angle and I found it so good says God
[58:49] God does not need to prepare anything
[58:54] &gt;&gt; in the sense that is omnipotent. God is
[58:57] omnipotent. He can create he can create
[59:00] anything in one stand. can like we saw
[59:03] the squirrel being created. God can
[59:05] create anything. God can create us in
[59:07] instant and having perfect love and
[59:09] anything. He has no need to prepare us.
[59:13] But God in John 14, he went to prepare a
[59:16] place.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? God omnipotent goes to
[59:20] prepare a place.
[59:23] Why? Because God like to respect the
[59:26] principle of preparation.
[59:28] That's how he put it. God likes to
[59:31] prepare a pre to have a principle of
[59:33] preparation. And us as well as
[59:36] Christians, if we are sons and daughters
[59:38] of God, we need to value preparation
[59:41] because God lacks preparation. Before
[59:44] you come to church, prepare yourself for
[59:46] the church. Stay in that condition. Stay
[59:48] in that atmosphere because God himself
[59:51] who can do things instantly lacks
[59:54] preparation. Amen.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; For anything, God lacks preparation. And
[59:57] he had to send Malachi 4 and Malachi 3
[1:00:00] to prepare the way for him. It could
[1:00:03] have been instant thing but God had to
[1:00:06] prepare a way. Amen. The same thing for
[1:00:08] some nature as well. We we can we can be
[1:00:11] married in instantly you get married.
[1:00:13] No, God likes the principle of
[1:00:15] preparation for marriage. You have to go
[1:00:17] through the cycles and courtship and go
[1:00:20] to the engagement and then you get
[1:00:22] married. Amen. The same thing for us.
[1:00:24] Amen. Even to go into the rapture, he
[1:00:27] puts us into a cycle of preparation. He
[1:00:30] has sent us Malachi 4 to prepare us.
[1:00:34] Amen. He has sent us all of the shout to
[1:00:37] prepare us for that rapture day. Amen.
[1:00:40] But it takes a moment and a time and a
[1:00:43] principle of preparation. And we come to
[1:00:46] church. Why do we come to church?
[1:00:48] Because we are preparing ourself for
[1:00:50] that rapture. Amen. God prepares himself
[1:00:53] could do things instantly but he goes to
[1:00:56] prepare a place that place is there for
[1:01:00] prepared people. Amen.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; That's why it's a prepared place for
[1:01:04] prepared people. Amen. That's why we
[1:01:06] come to church to prepare oursel. That's
[1:01:09] why we receive the message to prepare
[1:01:11] oursel. Amen. That's why we value to
[1:01:14] pray because we prepare oursel.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Lord continue to prepare me. Help me to
[1:01:20] prepare myself.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; We can take the same lessons from David
[1:01:28] and Saul. You know, Saul was a instant
[1:01:32] instant king.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; He was an instant king. You know, there
[1:01:35] was a need. The people rejected the
[1:01:37] prophet. They rejected God. We want a
[1:01:39] king. We want a king. God says, "It's
[1:01:40] okay. I will give you one." Amen. And he
[1:01:43] gave them a king. That king did not go
[1:01:46] through preparation. He was instant
[1:01:48] king. Oh, because he looked big. He
[1:01:51] looked nice and all people. Oh, King
[1:01:53] Saul. But when trials come, it shows his
[1:01:57] character because he was not prepared.
[1:02:00] Character is not a gift. God doesn't
[1:02:03] give you a good character instantly. God
[1:02:05] gives you a character that he has to
[1:02:07] prepare. He has to go through some
[1:02:09] trials, some training, some suffering,
[1:02:12] and some some patience in order to build
[1:02:16] that character. Amen. Then from that
[1:02:18] character, then you can reign. Amen.
[1:02:21] That was the difference with David.
[1:02:23] David, he was anointed. Even though he
[1:02:25] was a small boy, God already chose him
[1:02:28] to be a king. He anointed him to be a
[1:02:31] king. But didn't come the next day.
[1:02:34] Amen. God had to go through through the
[1:02:37] school of training, through the school
[1:02:39] of preparation as he's preparing him.
[1:02:42] Amen. He meets the bear. He He meets the
[1:02:45] lion. Amen. He meets the mockery of his
[1:02:47] brothers. He makes even Goliath.
[1:02:51] All that to prepare him to become the
[1:02:53] king so that in times in in difficult
[1:02:57] times he knows how to humble himself. He
[1:03:00] knows how to take care of the of his
[1:03:02] sheep. Amen. Even God through running
[1:03:04] away from the same anointing. The same
[1:03:07] anointing God gave him. It was the
[1:03:09] anointing that created more problem for
[1:03:11] him. Can you think about it? the
[1:03:13] anointing of becoming king that created
[1:03:16] more problems for him. That's why the
[1:03:18] brother mentioned even on Sunday say no
[1:03:20] sometimes God you don't it's not don't
[1:03:22] think like when you become a Christian
[1:03:24] then all the problem are solved
[1:03:26] instances no intent in instantaneously
[1:03:30] no sometimes they can even become harder
[1:03:33] they become when you become Christians
[1:03:35] why because God is preparing you for
[1:03:38] that city amen
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; so that we don't walk by our senses on
[1:03:45] the other side we cannot to rely on our
[1:03:47] senses. We have to rely on one sense,
[1:03:51] the faith of God. The faith in his in
[1:03:53] his word. The faith in his God's word
[1:03:56] will not change. Amen. Even on the other
[1:03:58] side, we'll be see Oh, God said so. So
[1:04:01] that nothing can break God's word. Amen.
[1:04:04] He promised me you have perfect faith.
[1:04:06] We know everything. Oh, praise be to
[1:04:08] God.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; So, I think I lost my thought there, but
[1:04:13] I will.
[1:04:15] So David David knew David had to go to
[1:04:18] the training and when God trained him
[1:04:21] then God made him a king.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And even when he made mistakes he
[1:04:26] knew how to humble himself before the
[1:04:28] word of the prophet because he went
[1:04:31] through a certain training through a
[1:04:33] certain preparation. Amen. Through a I
[1:04:36] will call it through a certain
[1:04:37] conditioning.
[1:04:39] God was conditioning him. He was he was
[1:04:41] working on him. He was putting him to a
[1:04:44] certain form to a certain statute to a
[1:04:46] certain to certain way where he wants
[1:04:48] him to be. Oh God, we don't want just to
[1:04:51] go in heaven without going through the
[1:04:53] conditioning of God. God, we want to go
[1:04:56] through your conditioning, rapturing
[1:04:58] conditioning, through your word
[1:05:01] preparation. Amen.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; You took in the Bible in looking on the
[1:05:08] Bible. Esther didn't just go and present
[1:05:12] herself to the king. Oh, here I'm a
[1:05:13] king. I'm I'm a virgin. And there so
[1:05:17] many virgins in that time.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; But there is one who was special. Amen.
[1:05:22] And it was Esther.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Why? She had a desire to accept to be
[1:05:27] conditioned. She had a desire to be
[1:05:29] prepared. And she find favor with Hega.
[1:05:33] Whatever Hega was saying, Esther will
[1:05:35] say, "Oh, I love that. I accept that. I
[1:05:39] believe what you say because you know
[1:05:41] the king better than I know."
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Thank God for Malachi 4. He knows the
[1:05:47] king better than we know. Amen. He was
[1:05:49] talking to God face to face. Amen. He
[1:05:52] was talking with the angels face to
[1:05:54] face. We were not there. He knows what
[1:05:56] the angels knows. Amen. He knows even
[1:05:58] the song that the angels like.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Who can say this song? Who who can you
[1:06:03] go in any denomination say you know this
[1:06:05] song the angel told me that this is song
[1:06:08] that he likes
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; who can say that who has that authority
[1:06:11] to say that
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; but we have the privilege to know
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; oh this song the angel likes it. Amen.
[1:06:20] He feels welcome when you see oh Lord oh
[1:06:24] I believe Lord I believe. He loves when
[1:06:28] you tell him that you believe the word
[1:06:30] of God. Oh, praise be to God. Thank you
[1:06:33] for the message of the hour.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; So Esther knew
[1:06:40] that he knows what the kings want. And
[1:06:43] then the he was preparing her. No, this
[1:06:45] is what you have to do. This is the
[1:06:47] anointing. This is the perfume he likes.
[1:06:49] This is what the kind of dress he likes.
[1:06:52] So before you present yourself to him,
[1:06:54] this is how you have to be dressed. And
[1:06:56] she prepared herself. And because she
[1:06:59] prepared, she condition herself and then
[1:07:01] the king accepted find favor in her as
[1:07:04] well. Oh, this one, this one, how come
[1:07:08] she smells the way I like? How come?
[1:07:11] Look how she's come. Oh, the kind of
[1:07:13] dress I like. Oh, no. No different
[1:07:16] things. No different to make yourself
[1:07:19] blue, green. No, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:07:22] Even though you're a virgin, a Christ,
[1:07:24] call yourself Christian. No, no, no, no,
[1:07:26] no, no, no, no, no high heels and no no
[1:07:29] no no no
[1:07:31] short skirts there. No, no, no.
[1:07:34] My guy must be talking. Tell her what I
[1:07:37] like. Amen.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; She doesn't take it as an orders that oh
[1:07:41] no this is I used to be I used to do
[1:07:44] that when I you used to be in Ireland. I
[1:07:46] used to do that when I was in Italy. I
[1:07:47] used to do that when I was in Africa. So
[1:07:49] why is you here? I used to change. No
[1:07:50] here you're in presence of the king.
[1:07:53] It's not about countries. It's not about
[1:07:54] No, this is the preparation to meet the
[1:07:57] king.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; This is the preparation for the rapture.
[1:08:00] Amen. Amen. So you condition yourself to
[1:08:04] fit the rapture. Amen.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; And then why God accepted her?
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Why God didn't do that miraculous you
[1:08:14] know you know Rebecca comes, Rebecca
[1:08:17] comes and you just go and meet the king
[1:08:19] and that's all you are done. No, she had
[1:08:22] to go through preparation to the
[1:08:25] messenger. Amen. To Elazar. I had to
[1:08:28] prepare her. I had to condition her. I
[1:08:30] had to tell her what Isa Isaac likes.
[1:08:33] This is what he likes. This is how you
[1:08:34] have to present yourself. This is how do
[1:08:37] you know? Do you know from all the man
[1:08:40] who was walking around in that field and
[1:08:43] she has met I don't know how many days,
[1:08:44] three days, whatever there was, you
[1:08:46] know, behind the camera. She has met so
[1:08:48] many men. So many men. But the Bible
[1:08:51] doesn't mention none of those men. But
[1:08:54] once she sees Isaac
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; says, "Oh, who is that man? Who who is
[1:09:00] that man?
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Is he is corresponding to the
[1:09:03] description you have given me of the man
[1:09:06] I have to meet? And I have prepared
[1:09:09] myself to meet that man." That's why she
[1:09:11] could say, "Who is that man from all the
[1:09:14] other mens?" That's why the bride is not
[1:09:16] surprised to know Jesus Christ our
[1:09:19] bridegroom because Malachi 4 has
[1:09:21] described to us who is our bridegroom
[1:09:24] and we can see and recognize oh who is
[1:09:27] this? It can only be the son of man.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; That's the conditioning we have been
[1:09:37] under. Amen.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. rapturing conditions.
[1:09:44] Brother took that to as well. And but
[1:09:47] look at look at look at Mary.
[1:09:53] Look at Mary. The first coming of the
[1:09:55] Lord, the virgin shall conceive.
[1:09:59] The mother Mary answered to her, the
[1:10:01] virgin shall conceive. I'll be closing.
[1:10:04] The mer the virgin shall conceive.
[1:10:08] That scriptures they have been preached
[1:10:09] for 800 years almost. The virgin shall
[1:10:13] conceive. The v all the virgin were
[1:10:15] keeping themselves and oh maybe it might
[1:10:17] be maybe it might be maybe it might be
[1:10:19] and maybe it might. Even the prophet
[1:10:20] says Mary was thinking about that
[1:10:23] scripture because the preacher spoke
[1:10:24] about it in the morning and then you
[1:10:26] thinking oh what did the preacher the
[1:10:28] virgin shall conceive. Oh wow. as she
[1:10:32] was thinking about the word of God.
[1:10:33] That's why we need to continue thinking
[1:10:35] about the word of God. There's so many
[1:10:37] distractions, so many things putting
[1:10:40] putting our thought away from the word
[1:10:42] of God. But as you stay on the word of
[1:10:44] God, as you meditate upon the word of
[1:10:46] God, he comes. He comes. Amen. Oh, God
[1:10:50] help us to meditate, to think more about
[1:10:52] Jesus Christ, to talk more about Jesus
[1:10:54] Christ. Let leave, let leave Trump
[1:10:56] alone. Let leave Carney and and and
[1:10:59] Palevo and what let them leave them a
[1:11:02] little bit alone. Amen. Let's think
[1:11:04] about God.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; And she was thinking about that
[1:11:10] scripture.
[1:11:11] And then the angel of the Lord came and
[1:11:13] said, "Oh, Mary, you are beloved. You
[1:11:16] have found favor with God. You have been
[1:11:19] chosen. You know you shall you shall
[1:11:21] give you shall give birth to the son of
[1:11:24] God
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; me.
[1:11:27] How is it possible? How is it possible?
[1:11:32] Even though she has been even though she
[1:11:35] has been preached that word of God has
[1:11:36] been preached that the word of God has
[1:11:38] been preached to her. A virgin shall
[1:11:40] conceive but where it has been addressed
[1:11:42] to her she still didn't understand.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; She still didn't comprehend how it will
[1:11:48] happen. So the people of the word of the
[1:11:51] message or not the people of the message
[1:11:52] the people in the Christian world they
[1:11:54] believing in the rapture but the way
[1:11:57] they are believing in the rapture is not
[1:11:58] the same way we are believing in the
[1:12:00] rapture. Amen. Even though we are
[1:12:03] quoting the same scripture of 1
[1:12:04] Thessalonians 4, they can quote it. We
[1:12:07] are waiting upon the Lord. They're
[1:12:08] waiting upon the Lord. Like in the first
[1:12:10] coming, we are waiting upon the Messiah
[1:12:12] to come through a virgin. But when it
[1:12:14] happened, they didn't have the
[1:12:16] revelation of what how it happened.
[1:12:18] Amen.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Mary said, "How can it happen?" I like
[1:12:22] the way the brother put it says I think
[1:12:26] maybe in our understanding she was
[1:12:28] thinking you know the preacher always
[1:12:31] mentions the virgin shall come and they
[1:12:34] can't explain that the only way they
[1:12:36] could explain that is maybe a man will
[1:12:39] take a virgin may have a son and that
[1:12:42] son god will make him a messiah
[1:12:46] because that I couldn't understand how
[1:12:48] it happened because even Mary had to had
[1:12:50] to ask the angel How was it possible to
[1:12:53] happen? Now the the supernatural
[1:12:57] happens. The angel explained to her the
[1:12:59] Holy Ghost will come and cover you,
[1:13:02] overshadow you. Then you shall have a
[1:13:04] son.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; That revelation, no other churches could
[1:13:08] have that revelation. No other virgin
[1:13:10] could have that revelation. That's the
[1:13:13] same thing for the rapture. Even though
[1:13:15] they quotes the rapture, even the quotes
[1:13:17] what first Thessalonians says, but no
[1:13:20] one has the interpretation of when the
[1:13:22] Lord is descending, they have a shout,
[1:13:25] they have the voice, they have a trump,
[1:13:27] no one can say the shout is the message.
[1:13:30] Amen. But thank God we have received the
[1:13:33] revelation of God in order to prepare us
[1:13:36] to put us in that condition. The angel
[1:13:39] has told us, you know, the shout is the
[1:13:42] message. The shout has come to prepare
[1:13:46] you for the rapture. Amen.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; I thank God for that. Praise be to God
[1:13:53] for the revelation.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost shall come and overshadow
[1:13:57] you. But you know that even that
[1:13:59] statement doesn't actually explain too
[1:14:02] many things.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; It was just a statement to oh something
[1:14:06] will happen. But then she made a clear
[1:14:08] statement that should be that should be
[1:14:10] our prayer. Let it be done to me
[1:14:12] according to your word. I still don't
[1:14:15] understand how the overshadowing will
[1:14:18] the overshadow overshadowing will
[1:14:20] produce a son. But because you have said
[1:14:23] it, praise be to God. Let it be done to
[1:14:25] me according to your word. What will
[1:14:28] change us? It is the message of the
[1:14:30] hour. How is it going to happen? I don't
[1:14:32] understand the mechanic of that, but
[1:14:35] thank God. Let it be done to me
[1:14:37] according to your word. I believe your

[1:35:20] you once again.
[1:35:22] Lord, you promised in your word that
[1:35:24] healing
[1:35:26] is the bread for the children.
[1:35:29] Father Lord, in your word, you said if a
[1:35:32] child asks you for bread, would you give
[1:35:34] him would you give him a a serpent,
[1:35:37] would you give him a stone?
[1:35:40] How much more our father is gracious and
[1:35:43] full of love? Will he give the Holy
[1:35:45] Ghost to those who ask him? Will he give
[1:35:47] him bread to those who ask him for
[1:35:49] bread? Father Lord probably
[1:35:53] some people among us Lord are sick and
[1:35:55] afflicted in the flesh. Lord Jesus
[1:35:58] Christ we are coming to you and praying
[1:36:02] that what you said in your word by your
[1:36:04] stripes we are already healed. It's a
[1:36:07] finished work in the work of Calvary.
[1:36:09] Father this evening Lord we are coming
[1:36:11] and uniting our faith and pray oh God
[1:36:15] whoever is sick among us Lord may the
[1:36:17] person go out from this place completely
[1:36:20] healed Lord claiming the blood of Jesus
[1:36:23] Christ father Lord you said in your word
[1:36:25] these are the signs that shall follow
[1:36:27] those who believe we are believers in
[1:36:30] your word father we have the super sense
[1:36:33] looking not at the symptoms looking not
[1:36:36] at what the flesh of the mind is saying
[1:36:39] but father Lord we are praying for our
[1:36:41] brother for our sister who sick this
[1:36:43] evening Lord that you will touch them
[1:36:45] father by the healing power of the Holy
[1:36:47] Ghost Lord that you restore them in the
[1:36:49] flesh in the name of Jesus Christ father
[1:36:52] you like to see us be being healed in
[1:36:55] the body so that we can praise you we
[1:36:57] can glorify you we can serve you
[1:36:59] faithfully father whoever is weak Lord

[1:37:03] Christ we are declaring them healed we
[1:37:06] are declaring them restored father Lord
[1:37:08] Where Father we those who are weak may
[1:37:11] they be strong in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:37:14] Father Lord you promise in your word oh

[1:37:18] who health who heal us for all our
[1:37:20] diseases all our sicknesses not only
[1:37:23] some of them but all of them. Father no
[1:37:26] matter what the name the medicine has
[1:37:28] given to it. No matter what the
[1:37:29] complicated name the pharmacies has
[1:37:31] given to it. But in the name of Jesus
[1:37:34] Christ father Lord we rebuke any spirit.
[1:37:36] We cast it in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:37:39] And we place the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:37:41] between the believer and that enemy
[1:37:44] between father lord our sister and an
[1:37:46] enemy between the brother and that enemy
[1:37:49] and remove that curse in the name of
[1:37:51] Jesus Christ because you took upon you
[1:37:54] the curse. Every curse has been taken by
[1:37:56] our Lord Jesus Christ and it has been
[1:37:58] nailed on the cross of Calvary so that
[1:38:01] we can be free and we have been declared
[1:38:04] free. Freedom is here. The healing is
[1:38:06] here because you promised and because
[1:38:09] you have already paid the price. So we
[1:38:11] pray like this, Father, that you
[1:38:13] increase the faith for each believer to
[1:38:15] claim what you have already purchased
[1:38:16] for them and may you heal them and
[1:38:18] restore them in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:38:21] we pray. Amen.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:42:49] Remember father Lord the special
[1:42:50] meetings that will be happening at the
[1:42:52] end of the month. Father, Lord Jesus
[1:42:54] Christ, we pray that you condition our
[1:42:56] souls and our heart, prepare the land,
[1:42:59] Lord, to receive also something that
[1:43:01] will help us, Lord, to have a closer and
[1:43:04] a deeper walk, a relationship with you.
[1:43:08] Father, we pray that every step of our
[1:43:10] walk will draw us closer to you, Father,
[1:43:12] as we see that we come to recognize our
[1:43:16] position. And as you said in your word
[1:43:17] when the church the bride will recognize
[1:43:19] who she is then the rapture will go
[1:43:22] because father lord what the bridegroom
[1:43:24] is ready is the bride that is not ready
[1:43:26] yet but father you have given us all the
[1:43:29] materials to make ourself ready to
[1:43:31] prepare ourself. Lord, if there is
[1:43:34] anything where we had negligent or the
[1:43:36] church of God is negligent on one thing,
[1:43:38] Father, may you stir our heart, Father,
[1:43:41] to recognize where is the weak spot that
[1:43:44] we can make ourself ready for you, Lord.
[1:43:46] Bless those special meetings, anoint the
[1:43:48] speakers, Father, and help us Lord to be
[1:43:51] in tune in the same harmony in the name
[1:43:53] of Jesus Christ. Remember us as well,
[1:43:55] Father, for this for the meetings on
[1:43:57] Sunday. May you, Lord, inspire the
[1:43:59] speaker, Lord, that will be preaching on
[1:44:01] Sunday. Father may you oh God use him
[1:44:04] and lead him into the study that to to
[1:44:07] know our needs. Father you are the
[1:44:09] discerner of the thought and intent of
[1:44:11] the heart is not a man following a man
[1:44:14] but is the man following the leadership
[1:44:16] of the Holy Ghost. You are the great
[1:44:18] shepherd Father. Lord may you come and
[1:44:20] speak to our need. May you meet our

[1:44:39] things of God. Father, the love of God.
[1:44:41] Father, there are many distractions in
[1:44:43] this world. But God, may you stir their
[1:44:46] heart. Lord, this word, this message is
[1:44:48] not only for grown up or for older
[1:44:50] people, but for each individual. Bring a
[1:44:53] revival even in their generation, in
[1:44:55] their time. Father, let it be a personal
[1:44:57] revelation to them. Father we pray we
[1:45:00] don't want to leave them aside but make
[1:45:02] us one in Christ as we are walking with
[1:45:05] you in this third exodus. We love you
[1:45:08] and appreciate you. Bless each family
[1:45:10] this evening that came Lord and you know
[1:45:12] the needs and may you speak to them. May
[1:45:15] you walk with them. May you lead them.

[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; come before your throne of grace,
[1:49:10] sons and daughters of God,
[1:49:13] that you predestinated us, Lord Jesus,
[1:49:16] before the foundation of the world to
[1:49:19] just be part of your end time plan,
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; to let our light shine, Lord, for the

[1:49:37] We thank you for your presence tonight,

[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Not to look at the situation,

[1:50:12] that promise, oh, Father God,
[1:50:15] Lord, for the many prayer requests this
[1:50:17] evening, Lord Jesus. Lord, you know each
[1:50:21] name. You know every hair and every
[1:50:22] head. You know the beginning from the
[1:50:25] end, oh Father God, and you're more than
[1:50:28] able, Lord, to reach out to the
[1:50:29] different prayer requests, Father, for
[1:50:31] the different families, for our loved
[1:50:33] ones, Lord, that are
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; maybe gone astray, Lord Jesus, stepped

[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, the grace of God in his life,
[1:51:00] Father,
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; you spared his life, Lord Jesus. It

[1:51:06] God. But
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; thank you.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Here he is at home, Lord. He's
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; on the mend and I'm reaching out to you
[1:51:12] in the name of Jesus Christ that you
[1:51:14] just
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; heal every broken bone in his body.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; His body, Lord Jesus. Give him healing,
[1:51:21] Lord, where his healing is needed.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Wrap your arms of love around the entire
[1:51:25] family, Lord Jesus. Raise their faith,
[1:51:28] oh Father God, to go through this time.

[1:51:32] recovery.
