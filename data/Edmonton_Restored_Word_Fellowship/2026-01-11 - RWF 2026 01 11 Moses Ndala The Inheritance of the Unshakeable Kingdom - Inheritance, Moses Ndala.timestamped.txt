[2:54] Welcome to Sunday service. Uh
[2:59] sister Anita, good to see you. Uh we
[3:02] thank the Lord for healing you. But what
[3:06] you did is you passed it on to brother
[3:08] Sig and we are praying for brother Sik
[3:09] to get better. [music] Um got a few um
[3:14] issues to get out of the way before we
[3:16] start our service.
[3:17] &gt;&gt; [music]
[3:17] &gt;&gt; So, like I said, if we can uh pray for
[3:20] brother sik, he's not feeling well
[3:21] today. Uh a praise report. Brother
[3:24] Victor's [music] mom wasn't feeling well
[3:26] and he posted uh a prayer request on the
[3:30] group chat. Uh there's a report that
[3:33] she's feeling much better. We thank the
[3:35] Lord for that.
[3:36] &gt;&gt; Uh brother Peter's [music] wife hit her
[3:39] feet. Uh there was a prayer request. I
[3:41] don't have an update but we let's keep
[3:44] praying um that the Lord [music] will
[3:47] touch her wherever she is.
[3:50] Uh brother goshen is traveling uh to
[3:53] Africa to get married. So we let's keep
[3:58] our brother in prayer. Uh pray that uh
[4:02] all the plans [music] uh there in Africa
[4:04] will go according to the to the Lord's
[4:07] will. uh sister Esther [music] is
[4:11] collecting a love offering for our
[4:14] brother. So if you feel it in your heart
[4:16] that you want to help your brother or
[4:19] just uh give uh something to your
[4:21] brother for his wedding, you [music] can
[4:22] see sister Esther, she's doing the
[4:25] collection. Uh
[4:29] also uh at [music] the back of the
[4:32] church outside
[4:34] uh
[4:35] we have posted a list [music] of names
[4:37] and addresses of uh donors of tithes and
[4:40] offerings. Uh if you can go and check as
[4:43] you make your way out, check uh [music]
[4:45] your name and address so that they will
[4:48] appear correctly on your donation
[4:50] receipts for the [music] year 2025. So
[4:54] you can just drop by a ticker against
[4:56] your name. Um, okay.
[5:01] Sister Rahma will be leaving for Africa
[5:04] on Tuesday to be with her husband.
[5:08] Um,
[5:10] Sister Lisa [music]
[5:11] is traveling on Tuesday.
[5:14] Oh, tomorrow. She's going back to the US
[5:16] [music] tomorrow. So, if we can also
[5:18] keep uh in our prayers. [music] I don't
[5:21] see brother Phillip. I know he's uh he's
[5:24] been working. So, let's keep him in our
[5:27] prayers [music] as well and keep praying
[5:29] that the Lord will find him a suitable
[5:32] position. We know it's it's [music] our
[5:33] brother's desire to be in church. He
[5:36] requested for he pastor on a prayer
[5:39] request that uh if the Lord can grant
[5:42] him, [music] he granted him a job. So
[5:45] what's more difficult getting a job than
[5:47] getting [music] a good shift that will
[5:49] make him be available for God's service
[5:52] here. Uh okay and we have a baptism
[5:57] after service. So if we can also bear in
[5:59] mind and uh pray for the young sister
[6:01] [music]
[6:02] Christristiana for that. Amen. Sorry
[6:05] that was a long list [music] but uh we
[6:08] got that out of the way. Let's uh if you
[6:10] can stand with me this morning. Let's
[6:12] see if we can [music] uh make some noise
[6:14] to the Lord. If you can help me out here
[6:18] in moments like this.

[29:31] to be in that secret place, the inner
[29:34] chamber, Father, to have fellowship with
[29:36] you. Let the shana glory come upon us,
[29:39] Father. Shine upon our soul, Lord Jesus
[29:42] Christ. Set us free, Father, from
[29:44] anything that is keeping us bound.
[29:47] Father, Lord, may you break the chains
[29:48] of the enemy. For those who came
[29:50] afflicted, Father, maybe in the flesh,
[29:52] maybe in their mind. May they come out
[29:54] of this place of this secret place.
[29:57] Father, delivered, set free. Father, you
[30:00] said the one that is set free by the Son
[30:02] of God is free indeed. Lord, let the
[30:05] power of the Holy Ghost come and move in
[30:07] a mighty way among us this morning.
[30:09] Father, Lord, may you come and Lord God,
[30:12] may you set them free. Those who are
[30:14] sick, Father, in the flesh, Father, you
[30:16] said by your stripes, we are already
[30:18] healed. Father Lord, do those who need
[30:20] deliverance in the soul. May you come in
[30:22] the power of the resurrection, break
[30:24] again the chains of death, Father, and
[30:26] bring liberty and victory in the name of
[30:29] Jesus Christ. Father, we desire to gain
[30:31] power, to gain strength, Father, for the
[30:33] race where we are in, Lord, give us
[30:36] energy, give us the faith, give us,
[30:38] Father, what we have need of, Lord, to
[30:40] have a closer walk with you, a life of
[30:43] victory, Lord, this morning. We give you
[30:45] the glory and the honor, Father. Bless
[30:47] your people this morning. Thank you for
[30:49] your presence, Lord. Thank you for the
[30:51] anointing. We love you and appreciate
[30:53] you, Father. Remember, Brother Zeke,
[30:55] Lord, may you touch him and heal him,
[30:57] Father. [music] For those who are not
[30:58] here, may you also touch them, be with
[31:00] them where they are, Lord. Those are
[31:02] streaming, those who listen to the to
[31:04] the to the stream later. Father, may you
[31:06] visit them in a special way as well. We
[31:09] give you the glory and the honor in
[31:10] [music] the name of Jesus Christ, we
[31:12] pray. Amen.
[31:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music]
[31:17] Amen. Thank you musicians and thank you
[31:19] song leader. God bless you richly.
[31:21] [music] Amen. And God bless you all.
[31:25] It's good to be in the house of the
[31:26] Lord. Amen. You make the church and
[31:30] without you there is not be any church.
[31:33] It will be just a storage room. But you
[31:36] by coming you make this become a church.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you richly for being
[31:40] here.
[31:45] a little bit of a program today. So,
[31:49] just go to the word of God right away
[31:52] and
[31:55] we had a youth meeting on on on
[31:59] Friday. It was just wonderful and thank
[32:02] God for
[32:04] the Monukis family opening the door and
[32:07] welcoming the
[32:09] &gt;&gt; the youth and appreciate that. God bless
[32:12] them richly. Amen.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; And that was good fellowship just to
[32:16] around the word of God but also among
[32:19] themselves and parents on the side so
[32:22] talking and we just um you know um it's
[32:27] not it's not a one man's ministry. So we
[32:30] need one another.
[32:31] &gt;&gt; It's a bit too high. It's too low.
[32:38] Oh,
[32:41] it's better.
[32:43] Okay.
[32:47] Yeah, we need one another. Definitely.
[32:51] I just say we need one another. So
[32:53] that's uh so that's uh so just there as
[32:56] we fellowshipping with brothers and just
[32:58] have good ideas and sharing that. So
[33:01] just realize that uh we need one
[33:03] another. Amen. Amen.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; So, it's important to have fellowship. I
[33:08] invite you to go to um the book of
[33:10] Colossians,
[33:14] familiar scripture. Colossians chapter
[33:17] 1.
[33:47] Colossians chapter 1 verse 10 to 19
[33:53] then I'll let you sit and I'll read
[33:55] another one in Hebrews 12.
[33:59] So the word of God says Colossians,
[34:01] Colossians comes after Philippians. Um
[34:04] Philippians comes after Ephesians I
[34:06] think. And then so um
[34:13] 10 says
[34:15] that he might walk worthy of the Lord
[34:18] unto all pleasing being fruitful in
[34:21] every good work and increasing in the
[34:25] knowledge of God. Is that what we desire
[34:28] to increase until we come to the stature
[34:30] of the perfect man? It says, "Strengthen
[34:33] with all might according to his glorious
[34:36] power unto all patience and
[34:39] longsuffering with joyfulness."
[34:42] says, "Giving thanks unto the Father
[34:44] which had made us meat to be partakers
[34:48] of an inheritance of saints and light
[34:52] who had delivered us from the power of
[34:54] darkness and has translated us onto into
[34:57] the kingdom of his dear son." So that's
[35:01] where I would like to focus now today is
[35:03] to be translated into the kingdom of his
[35:06] dear son in whom we have redemption
[35:09] through his blood even the forgiveness
[35:12] of sins who is the image of the
[35:15] invisible God the firstborn of every
[35:19] creature. For by him were all things
[35:22] created that are in heaven, that are on
[35:24] earth, visible and invisible, whether
[35:27] they be thrones or dominions or
[35:30] principalities or powers. All things
[35:33] were created by him and for him. And he
[35:36] is before all things, and by him all
[35:38] things consist. And he is and he is the
[35:41] head of the body, the church with the
[35:44] beginning, the firstborn from the dead,
[35:47] that in all things he might have the
[35:49] preeminence. For it pleased the father
[35:52] that in him shall all fullness dwell.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. May God bless his word. Can I have
[35:58] a seat?
[36:01] And glory to his name. Just wonderful to
[36:05] read what pertains to our Lord Jesus
[36:07] Christ is the head of the body. Amen.
[36:11] Is the head of the body so that he might
[36:14] have preminence upon all the body. Amen.
[36:18] I so want just to special greetings to
[36:21] my my friend George there. Welcome.
[36:26] uh
[36:28] just uh he came here last year but uh
[36:32] see uh we just get in contact so spend a
[36:36] little time after work and and yeah you
[36:39] might you might remember George remember
[36:42] George
[36:44] you used to be in a the same business
[36:46] back then
[36:49] yeah [laughter]
[36:52] &gt;&gt; long time yeah
[36:54] so we will uh We used to work together
[36:57] in the business together, brother Yahoo
[36:59] and brother George there. So after
[37:02] meeting we spend a little time and talk
[37:04] about past [laughter]
[37:08] no not grieving but still
[37:12] talk about it. So welcome. Um,
[37:16] Hebrews 12 2020 20
[37:32] Hebrews chapter 12 verse
[37:37] 20 22nd verse
[37:45] So Paul years make a difference between
[37:48] the law of Moses
[37:50] and [snorts] says 21 says so terrible
[37:52] was the sight that Moses said exceeding
[37:54] fear and quake. Then he make now the
[37:57] transition to what we have come to. say
[38:00] that, but we are come unto Mount Zion,
[38:03] unto the city of the living God, the
[38:05] heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable
[38:09] company of angels, to the general
[38:12] assembly and church of the firstborn,
[38:14] which are written in heaven, and to God
[38:17] the judge of all, and to the spirits of
[38:20] just man made perfect, and to Jesus the
[38:24] mediator of the new covenant, and to the
[38:26] blood of the sprinkling that speaketh
[38:29] better things than that of Abel. That
[38:31] blood is still speaking better things
[38:33] today.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; The blood of the Lord Jesus Christ is
[38:36] not crying for vengeance, but it's
[38:38] crying for healing, for forgiveness, for
[38:40] salvation, for redemption, for joy, for
[38:43] peace. Whatever we have need of,
[38:45] whatever he paid on the on the Calvar
[38:48] tree today, that blood, it's still it's
[38:50] still speaking better things on our
[38:52] behalf and it's still here. It's still
[38:55] available. And then it says 25th, I
[38:58] think 25th says, "See that you refuse
[39:00] not him that speaketh. For if they
[39:03] escape not to refuse him that spake on
[39:06] that spake on earth, much more shall not
[39:09] we escape. If we turn away from him that
[39:12] speaketh from heaven." So the one that's
[39:15] speaking now is speaking from heaven
[39:17] whose voice then shook the earth but now
[39:20] he had promised yet saying yet once more
[39:23] I shake not the earth only but also
[39:26] heaven. And this word yet once more
[39:30] signifth the removing of those things
[39:32] that are shaken as of things that are
[39:35] made that those things which cannot be
[39:37] shaken may remain. Wherefore we
[39:40] receiving a kingdom which cannot be
[39:43] moved, let us have grace whereby we may
[39:46] serve God acceptably with reverence and
[39:50] godly fear for God is a consuming fire.
[39:55] Amen.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Just want to focus on the verse 28.
[39:58] Wherefore I said that's why we have we
[40:01] receiving a kingdom which cannot be
[40:03] moved. Let us have grace whereby we may
[40:06] serve God acceptably with reverence and
[40:09] godly fear. Just bow our head one more
[40:12] time. Father, we have read the
[40:14] scripture, the word of God, the holy
[40:16] word. Father Lord, we pray that you give
[40:18] us the context. Father Lord, may you as
[40:21] a prayer was done was made earlier,
[40:23] brother Dan, Father, we desire just to
[40:26] speak one word, something that will
[40:28] strike our heart. Help us Lord in our
[40:30] walk. That's what we desire. Help us
[40:33] Lord for the speaker and the hearers.
[40:35] Let the Holy Spirit move on each and
[40:37] every one of us in Jesus Christ's name.
[40:40] Amen.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; I would like to talk this morning about
[40:45] um the so brother Peter I'll start maybe
[40:49] putting the tit so I put the title there
[40:51] so that um you'll be safe for you. So I
[40:54] put a title as a note there. um um the
[40:57] inheritance of the unshakable kingdom
[41:00] says we have received a kingdom that
[41:03] cannot be moved. So that we have
[41:06] received something that God has given us
[41:09] a kingdom that cannot be moved that
[41:11] cannot be shaken as an announcement of
[41:14] the capstone of the pyramid that we are
[41:16] going through. So it's not something
[41:18] that is in the future. It's something
[41:21] that we have received that is available
[41:24] to have a want it. Amen. Whoever is
[41:27] growing with God it's available. The
[41:30] prophet to say first I would like to
[41:32] start with this. The prophet says in
[41:34] each local church there is nine
[41:35] spiritual gift that come among the
[41:37] people that is knowledge, wisdom, gift
[41:39] of healing, working of miracles,
[41:41] speaking with tongs, interpretation of
[41:44] thanks and all these things go in each
[41:46] local body and every person in the
[41:48] church has an individual ministry and
[41:51] that individual ministry goes together
[41:54] with the rest of the ministry to edify
[41:56] the body of Jesus Christ. Sometimes you
[42:00] might think, "No, I'm just there. I'm
[42:01] just coming church and I go back. I
[42:03] don't have any ministry. I don't have
[42:04] anything." But the prophet says, "Every
[42:07] one of us, every one of us has a
[42:09] ministry.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Every one of us has a place. Every one
[42:13] of us can edify someone else." Amen. So
[42:16] you are very important in God's eyes.
[42:19] God does not neglect you. God doesn't
[42:21] put on just this part is not important
[42:23] for the body. No, every part is
[42:26] important for the body. That's why we
[42:28] need one another so much in this age.
[42:31] Amen. Because I cannot be complete
[42:34] without you. You cannot be complete
[42:35] without me. So I depend on you. You
[42:38] depend on me. We depend on the Lord
[42:40] Jesus Christ.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; And I relying on God's working through
[42:44] you. Amen. As you are relying on God's
[42:47] working through me. Amen. One another.
[42:49] So important because each person in the
[42:52] church has an individual ministry. Amen.
[42:55] as we can be blessed on different ways
[42:57] through the songs and the presence to
[42:59] the amen creating the atmosphere and all
[43:02] that is important never don't let the
[43:05] enemy try to take that from you it's
[43:07] very important
[43:09] so talking about in kingdom I just want
[43:12] to say here that I'm not I'm not a
[43:14] politician but uh we we we sometimes we
[43:18] can't afford to to avoid to see what
[43:20] things are happening in the world and
[43:22] things like that so I'm not trying to
[43:24] win people here and then everything on
[43:26] one side of the politics and everything.
[43:28] But um you know the politicians
[43:30] sometimes they say
[43:33] uh you know when politicians are
[43:35] campaigning they say you know what they
[43:37] will they will they will draw the bad
[43:38] things or say oh no look this economy is
[43:41] bad and things and immigration and
[43:43] everything they will they will they put
[43:45] a picture on negative things. Amen. And
[43:48] then once they are in power then they
[43:50] try to no there's no problem. There's no
[43:52] pro like everything is fine. But when
[43:55] they out then they will again need to
[43:56] come the negative things. So that's
[43:58] that's not how God works.
[44:01] God does not need to change and to try
[44:03] to depict that things are but God God
[44:06] the word of God is the absolute. The
[44:08] word of God what the word of God says is
[44:10] the absolute. We might not understand it
[44:12] at the beginning but it still remains
[44:14] the absolute. There are many voices now
[44:17] many different voices going around but
[44:18] there is only one voice that is the
[44:20] absolute is the word of God. Amen. So I
[44:23] think the prophet preached this message
[44:25] and many of my quot my thoughts come
[44:26] from this message. The world is falling
[44:29] apart.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; The world is falling apart and it's
[44:32] still real today. The world is falling
[44:34] apart. There's nothing that can bring
[44:36] this world from coming back outside of
[44:39] the world of outside of the word of God.
[44:42] I believe it's not a coincidence that
[44:44] this message the pro the message that
[44:46] prophet preached this message the first
[44:48] message one of the first message I
[44:50] believe that after the seals it says the
[44:52] world is falling apart in other words
[44:55] outside of the seed outside of the word
[44:57] of God outside of the seals that have
[44:59] been revealed this world everything will
[45:02] be crumbling everything will be falling
[45:04] apart amens
[45:06] are nothing else but Christ the word of
[45:08] God is nothing else but Christ in the
[45:10] beginning in the Beginning was the word.
[45:12] The word was with God. The word was with
[45:14] God. The word was made flesh. And then
[45:16] in the in the Lord Jesus Christ, Jesus
[45:19] Christ, the Lord Jesus Christ is the
[45:21] word of God being revealed. Amen. If you
[45:23] say I love the Lord, you have to love
[45:25] the word of God because they are one.
[45:28] There are three people there three there
[45:30] three say that I'm putting there three
[45:31] things or three three are making witness
[45:34] are witnessing in heaven. It will say
[45:36] the father, the word and the spirit and
[45:39] those are one. It's not separate. They
[45:41] all one. Amen. You can't separate the
[45:44] father from the word. You can't separate
[45:45] the word from the holy spirit. All are
[45:47] one. It's not three persons in in a
[45:49] deity. It's one person in different
[45:52] offices. Amen.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; So it says as it was in the time as it
[45:57] was in the time of Noah, so shall it be
[45:59] in the time when the son of man is
[46:00] revealed. So shall it be in the coming
[46:03] of the son of man. The whole thing
[46:05] crumbling and falling apart. Certainly
[46:07] they could not believe that he could be
[46:09] destroyed. One time you know one time I
[46:12] went went with my the family to B and
[46:15] everything and after that they were
[46:17] showing us showing we went to a place
[46:20] where there used to be
[46:22] coal mine and everything and there was a
[46:24] city there used to be a city there and I
[46:26] look at that and then just told my wife
[46:29] you know what you know at one time this
[46:31] place was maybe flourishing and
[46:33] everything. It was the economy. It was
[46:35] the boom of the economy at that time.
[46:38] But today it's just ruin. Then I just
[46:40] reminded them there is no continuing
[46:42] city here.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; We have no continuing city here. Anyway,
[46:48] we go one time went to Rome and I went
[46:50] to Rome and you see the place where
[46:52] there used to be a big the great empire
[46:56] and everything the great kingdom of Rome
[46:59] but today is just ruins and people are
[47:01] working on it and everything is just
[47:03] this is nothing. So we have no
[47:05] continuing city here. No matter how
[47:08] powerful it can be, no matter how great
[47:09] it can be, one day it will just be ruins
[47:13] &gt;&gt; just pass away. Amen. Only one thing
[47:15] cannot be shaken.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Only one thing cannot be moved is the
[47:20] kingdom of God. Amen.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; All the other kingdoms are just are just
[47:24] are just temporal. They just the time
[47:26] they will come and they will pass. But
[47:28] the kingdom of God can never pass. The
[47:31] kingdom of God is eternal. Amen.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; You see in Egypt in time of the pyramids
[47:37] such a glorious empire. Look at it and
[47:40] today is just ruin. See the empire of
[47:42] Babylon today it fell apart. You look at
[47:44] Rome as I mentioned today is nothing.
[47:46] The only permanent is the new Jerusalem
[47:49] from above where we have come to. Amen.
[47:52] We have come to the new Jerusalem to the
[47:54] kingdom of God that cannot be moved.
[47:56] That the only thing that cannot be
[47:58] shaken. Amen. I want to hold to that
[48:00] unshaken hands of God. The kingdom of
[48:03] God that way is the stability. Any other
[48:06] thing is just shaking. It's just moving
[48:08] ground. Only upon the kingdom of God
[48:11] that something that cannot be moved.
[48:13] Amen. That's why really I want really to
[48:15] emphasize this this this morning is let
[48:17] hold to the thing that cannot be shaken.
[48:20] Anything else will be shaken today looks
[48:22] like a good idea tomorrow it's a bad
[48:24] idea or tomorrow it look like a bad idea
[48:27] tomorrow it's a good idea man keeps
[48:29] changing man keeps changing ideas
[48:31] changing poly things but the word of God
[48:35] stays stable. Amen.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Let me go back a little bit to the dream
[48:40] of Neb. uh go with you in the Bible. The
[48:43] kingdom of Babylon was the greatest of
[48:45] all of them. We see Daniel gives that
[48:48] interpretation of the dream of that
[48:50] statute of the dream that of of
[48:52] Nebuchadnezzar. So in Daniel 2:37, he
[48:56] say 38:7 says, "Oh king, are a king of
[49:01] kings." Daniel 2:37, "For the God of
[49:04] heaven had given thee a kingdom, power,
[49:06] and strength and glory. Wheresoever the
[49:09] children of man dwell, the beasts of the
[49:11] field and the fowls of the heaven have
[49:14] he given unto thine hand have made thee
[49:16] ruler over them. For the art this head
[49:19] of gold. This simpl this passage shows
[49:22] that Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon was the
[49:24] head of gold means it was the first and
[49:27] the greatest kingdom of all of them. You
[49:29] know you you see that that status shows
[49:32] actually it was given a grace to that
[49:34] king to to see all the different
[49:37] kingdoms that will come after him. You
[49:39] saw the kingdom of Babylon himself where
[49:41] he was the head. You saw the kingdom of
[49:43] Median person where they will come and
[49:45] they saw the other kingdom that will
[49:46] come again about the Greece and and in
[49:48] Rome at the end. Let's just go to the
[49:50] scripture here. And it says the other in
[49:53] Daniel 2:39, "And after thee shall arise
[49:56] another kingdom inferior to thee, the
[49:58] median persia says, another third
[50:00] kingdom of brass, which will be Greece,
[50:03] and thou shall bear rule over all the
[50:05] earth." Then and the fourth kingdom
[50:07] shall be strong as iron, which is Rome.
[50:10] For as much as iron breakth in pieces,
[50:12] and subdued all things, and as iron that
[50:15] breakth all these shall it be break in
[50:17] pieces and bruise. And whereas thou
[50:20] seest the feet and the toes, part of
[50:23] potter's clay and part of iron, the
[50:25] kingdom shall be divided, and they shall
[50:28] be in it of the strength of the iron.
[50:30] For as much as they saw as the iron
[50:32] mixed with with marry clay.
[50:36] This is the time we are living is the
[50:38] time of the feet. Part of it is the is
[50:40] the clay. Part of it is the iron. And
[50:43] the clay is Russia. And the iron is a is
[50:46] a is is a is is a is is a united state.
[50:50] So the kingdom shall be divided and
[50:51] there shall be in it as a strength of
[50:53] the iron for as much as that so as the
[50:55] iron mixed with merry clay. They might
[50:57] sometimes they look like they're working
[50:59] together but in reality they can never
[51:01] mix. They will always be one block east
[51:04] and one block west. Always always all
[51:06] the time. They might look like sometimes
[51:08] they can they can rec reconcile but they
[51:10] will never reconcile. It's promise that
[51:13] they can never be mixed. As we see that
[51:15] we see the prophecies being fulfilled.
[51:18] That's why the bride is not being
[51:19] surprised. The bride is not being
[51:21] shaken. The bride is not be going to a
[51:24] Christian should not be be uncertain to
[51:26] go to one side or go to the other side.
[51:28] You know where you are standing. You
[51:30] know what the word of God says. You
[51:32] should have to be just as stable. Amen.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Just staying with the word of God. As we
[51:36] see that the prophet will point to that.
[51:39] He says, "You see our cruchev crv means
[51:42] in in Russian means clay and eisenhower
[51:46] which which means the iron you know they
[51:49] at some point they were together and at
[51:51] some point the crew during the United
[51:54] Nations he took his shoe and then and he
[51:57] put it on the table and he was just
[51:58] slapping the table is against about the
[52:01] against what the the American were doing
[52:03] at that time and he says you see the
[52:05] prophecies being fulfilled what Daniel
[52:08] prophesied eyes is being fulfilled now.
[52:10] So we are in the time of the fulfillment
[52:12] of the prophecies of God.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our eyes are being opened. WE SEE
[52:17] WHAT HAPPENING. If it was already in the
[52:20] time of brother Bam there, how much is
[52:22] it in the time we are living in? It it's
[52:25] it's more than late. If you know I can
[52:27] say it in English, this can be it. IT'S
[52:30] TIME IS ALREADY PASSED. WE ARE IN THE
[52:31] TIME OF THE PATIENCE OF GOD. IT'S NOT
[52:34] TIME TO PLAY CHURCH ANYMORE. IT'S NOT
[52:37] TIME TO BE NEGLIGENT ANYMORE. It's time
[52:39] to be more sincere with God BECAUSE THE
[52:42] COMING OF THE LORD CAN HAPPEN ANY TIME.
[52:44] WE ARE ALREADY IN THE PROCESS of the
[52:46] coming of the Lord. Amen. As a brother
[52:49] prayed, we have already received. We
[52:51] have already received THE HUSBAND COMING
[52:52] DOWN. NOW, IT'S THE TIME OF THE UNION of
[52:55] the bride and the bridegroom. It's a
[52:58] time to be united WITH THE WORD OF GOD.
[53:00] AMEN.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[53:08] Just allow me to to read my notes here.
[53:10] Says, "But now if not realized yet, we
[53:12] should realize nothing on this earth on
[53:15] this earthly side is certain. Nothing is
[53:18] certain. If you want to trust the
[53:20] government, I'll say good luck to you.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; You can't put your trust in the
[53:25] government. The government is corrupt.
[53:27] Nothing is certain. Today there will be
[53:29] one way, the tomorrow there will change.
[53:31] There's nothing there." says, "We live
[53:34] in the day of uncertainty.
[53:36] Our nation is rotten to the roots."
[53:39] &gt;&gt; That's right. There's no hope for it.
[53:42] It's all gone. There's only one thing to
[53:44] look for is the coming of the Lord.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Only the coming of the Lord is our
[53:49] consolation. Is our comfort. The
[53:52] government is not our comfort. You know,
[53:54] we can be there. We can put back
[53:56] Trudeau. Maybe you don't like Trudeau.
[53:58] You keep him out. You put another one
[54:00] Mark Carney on. Maybe maybe you might
[54:02] keep it out. There is no solution in
[54:05] government. I'm not Democrat. I'm not
[54:07] Republican. I'm not liberal. I'm not
[54:09] NDP. I'm not green. I'm just a
[54:13] Christian. Amen.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; One person came one time the house and
[54:17] he said, you know, you are conservative.
[54:19] I like many ideas of conservatives. It's
[54:21] very good. I don't like those liberal
[54:23] blah blah blah things. But you know
[54:25] what? BUT OH, SO YOU are really how come
[54:28] you he thought that he found someone?
[54:30] Oh, so you don't believe in I don't
[54:32] believe in those liberal things. Oh,
[54:34] wow. You must be Can you recite
[54:36] something? I already be taken by
[54:38] something else. Can you come to the
[54:40] place where I have also my party?
[54:42] [laughter]
[54:44] Can you come to the church? Come to the
[54:46] church. That's where I go to fellowship.
[54:48] I don't go to any other political party.
[54:51] I've already voted for one. I voted for
[54:53] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; That's where my soul is gone. Amen.
[54:57] Amen.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; So the prophet says
[55:04] in the world is falling apart. They
[55:05] might elect a president or even Abraham
[55:08] Lincoln in every county of the United
[55:10] States and to never hold it together
[55:13] till we get back to the word of God.
[55:15] back to the oldfashioned black back
[55:18] black back Bible that's got the truth
[55:21] that the only way we'll ever know God
[55:23] and keep our world together is back to
[55:26] the principle of Jesus Christ back to
[55:28] his doctrine back to the Holy Ghost
[55:30] again leading the church. In other
[55:32] words, you can you can think you can
[55:35] elect this one you can. No, you can
[55:38] never come back. This world is falling
[55:41] apart.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; It's going to fall apart. You can maybe
[55:44] you can put Biden. You can remove Biden.
[55:47] You can bring what is now Trump. Make
[55:51] America great again. It will never be
[55:54] great again. Oh, it might look like a
[55:57] little bit the peace and everything and
[55:58] one day it will just crumble. I mean
[56:01] because there is no hope. When everybody
[56:03] say peace, peace, peace, peace, peace,
[56:05] then great destruction will come.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; There there is no hope for the world.
[56:10] The only hope is in the word of God.
[56:13] The only hope is in the kingdom of God
[56:15] that cannot be shaken. Anything else
[56:18] will be shaken. Amen.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; The handwriting is already on the wall.
[56:23] The angel has already announced this
[56:25] world is finished. EVEN THOUGH YOU MIGHT
[56:28] NOT see it today, but one day you'll see
[56:30] it will be finished. CALIFORNIA WILL BE
[56:33] under the sea. IT WILL HAPPEN. I'M not a
[56:37] prophet of doom, but I'm just announcing
[56:39] the word of God. It's going to happen.
[56:41] So the only way of escape is going to
[56:44] the rapture. Amen. WE WILL BE CUT AWAY.
[56:47] AMEN. AND THIS WORLD will be destroyed.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Humanly speaking, there's no certainty
[56:56] in politics. No need to emphasize on it.
[56:59] But it's already rotten. Some rely on
[57:01] dictatorship. Dictatorship is rotten.
[57:04] Some brag about democracy. Let me tell
[57:06] you, democracy is also rotten. The
[57:10] prophet says democracy is rotten. I
[57:12] believe democracy and then he says
[57:14] certainly I'm an American. I believe in
[57:16] democracy but at the rotten thing there
[57:18] is there at the rotten things that in
[57:21] democracy means it's also rotten. It's
[57:23] also why is it rotten? Because it is
[57:26] uncertain sound. You can't rely on it.
[57:28] The nations give an uncertain sound.
[57:31] Employment gives an uncertain sound.
[57:33] Everything is about uncertain. If you
[57:35] are hoping for your pension to make you
[57:37] rich, I would say good luck to you. It's
[57:40] uncertain. Uncertain everywhere.
[57:42] Uncertainty. There's uncertainty in your
[57:44] job. Uncertainty in politics. But we
[57:47] thank God for the word of God. The word
[57:49] of God gives a certain sound. It's
[57:52] clear. IT'S REAL. AMEN. LIKE I SAID, the
[57:55] blood IS STILL SPEAKING BETTER THINGS.
[57:57] It's clear. IT'S CERTAIN. IT CANNOT BE
[57:59] CHANGED. I WILL BE WITH YOU, EVEN IN YOU
[58:03] UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD. ONE MIGHT
[58:06] ONE,000 MIGHT FALL AT YOUR LEFT AND
[58:07] 10,000 AT THE RIGHT, BUT I WILL KEEP YOU
[58:09] SAFE IF YOU STAY IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD.
[58:13] THAT'S WHERE certainty is. The other
[58:15] side of that, the world is falling
[58:17] apart. We have received all a kingdom
[58:20] that cannot be shaken. Anything else
[58:22] will be shaken and must be shaken. Amen.
[58:25] What happened in the in the dream of the
[58:28] king Nebuchadnezzar? It's actually we
[58:30] are in the middle of heat being
[58:32] happening because Daniel 2:34 says, "Thy
[58:35] saw as still that a stone was cut out
[58:38] without hand, which more the image upon
[58:41] the feet that were on iron and clay and
[58:44] break them to pieces. Then was the iron,
[58:47] the clay, the brass, the silver, the
[58:49] gold, the broken to pieces together, and
[58:52] became like the shaft of the summer.
[58:54] threshing floors and the wind carried
[58:56] them away that no place was found for
[58:59] them and that stone that smoked the
[59:01] image became a great mountain and fill
[59:04] the whole earth. I believe there is
[59:07] there is a physical manifestation of
[59:10] that prophecy. Amen. There is a physical
[59:12] manifestation of that prophecy. One day
[59:14] these kingdoms will be over and only one
[59:17] kingdom that will stay in the millennium
[59:19] is the kingdom of the Messiah of the
[59:21] Lord Jesus Christ. And we are looking
[59:23] forward to that time. Amen. We are
[59:25] looking to forward to the manifest to
[59:26] the to the the manifestation of that
[59:29] kingdom to come and be real. So there
[59:31] will be no no sickness in that. There is
[59:34] no no death in that kingdom. There is no
[59:37] be there will be NO TAXES. THERE WILL BE
[59:39] NO RECEIPT AND and bills.
[59:43] All the different negative things. There
[59:45] won't be in THAT KINGDOM. ONLY JOY
[59:48] ETERNAL. AMEN. PRAISE BE TO GOD. THAT'S
[59:50] WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR. THAT'S WHERE
[59:52] OUR JOY IS.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Glory to his name. There will not be
[59:55] separation anymore. No death, no crying,
[59:58] no weeping. Only joy eternal. Thank God
[1:00:01] for that. But as but also in the
[1:00:04] spiritual realm, this prophecy is being
[1:00:06] fulfilled in the spiritual realm. Now we
[1:00:09] used to be slaves of kingdoms. We'll be
[1:00:11] slave of backgrounds. We slave of of
[1:00:14] traditions. We be slave of we thinking
[1:00:16] this. I came from this place. I came
[1:00:18] from that place. I came from that place.
[1:00:20] BUT THANK GOD THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED THE
[1:00:23] WORD OF the hour. The word of the hour
[1:00:25] came as the capstone AND CRUSHED ALL THE
[1:00:28] KINGDOMS IN OUR HEART. WE USED TO HAVE
[1:00:30] DIFFERENT KINGDOMS IN OUR HEART. BUT
[1:00:32] THAT WORD OF GOD CAME AND CRUSHES THEM
[1:00:34] AND REMOVE THEM. AND NOW THAT KINGDOM
[1:00:37] HAS TO BE THAT THAT STONE THAT MIGHT
[1:00:39] LOOK LIKE A small stone that was not cut
[1:00:42] by any man. That small stone of
[1:00:44] revelation that you got in your heart.
[1:00:46] That small stone of revelation your
[1:00:48] heart HAS NOW TO GROW AND BECOME A GREAT
[1:00:51] MOUNTAIN BECOME A GREAT KINGDOM IN YOUR
[1:00:54] SOUL. AMEN. WE ARE NOW celebrating or we
[1:00:58] ARE CELEBRATING THE COMING OF THE
[1:01:00] CAPSTONE IN OUR SOUL. AMEN. THE COMING
[1:01:02] OF THE capstone through the word OF GOD
[1:01:04] IN OUR SOUL TO ESTABLISH THE KINGDOM OF
[1:01:07] GOD IN OUR [screaming] HEART. AMEN.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE I'M RELYING THE THANK GOD
[1:01:12] FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD IN MY HEART.
[1:01:14] AMEN. THAT CANNOT BE SHAKEN.
[1:01:17] [clears throat]
[1:01:20] [snorts]
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; No man controls you. No man as here
[1:01:25] controls you. The only thing that should
[1:01:27] control you and will control you is the
[1:01:29] capstone in your heart. It becames the
[1:01:32] great mountain of revelation. Daniel
[1:01:35] said when he saw that, he gave the
[1:01:36] interpretation. Daniel 12:33 he says,
[1:01:39] "But go thou thy way to the ends, but
[1:01:42] thou shalt rest and stand in thy lot
[1:01:44] until the end of days." Daniel saw the
[1:01:47] kingdoms, but did not leave to see all
[1:01:49] the kingdoms. But we are those coming at
[1:01:52] the end time. We see, oh, now we see the
[1:01:55] interpretation of all a dream being
[1:01:57] manifested through the age. He gave the
[1:01:59] interpretation, but now we we know what
[1:02:02] it means. We have even studied in
[1:02:04] schools where they mean. But now we COME
[1:02:06] TO THE LAST kingdoms and the natural
[1:02:08] kingdoms. And as we see the natural
[1:02:10] kingdom, we realize, oh, now we are the
[1:02:12] END OF THE END TIME. SO IT'S NOT only
[1:02:16] it's not only it's not only a theory,
[1:02:19] but it's a reality. We are right in the
[1:02:21] middle of the word of God being
[1:02:23] fulfilled. So let's OPEN OUR EYES,
[1:02:26] SPIRITUAL EYES, AND PINCH OURSELVES.
[1:02:28] LORD, I'M IN THE TIME of the fulfillment
[1:02:31] of the word of God
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; and I want that word of God to be real
[1:02:34] for me. As we see the world falling
[1:02:37] apart and the going in the corruption
[1:02:39] that going, there is also another PART
[1:02:41] FOR THE BRIDE WHERE SHE HAS TO STAND AND
[1:02:43] come to the place where she HAS BEEN
[1:02:45] CALLED TO. AMEN. WHERE SHE has to be the
[1:02:47] manifestation of Christ.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning?
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:55] Prophet says [snorts]
[1:02:58] we wasn't promised a system. The world
[1:03:00] is falling apart. We were promised. What
[1:03:02] was we promised? A kingdom. How do we
[1:03:05] get into it? By one spirit. We are all
[1:03:08] baptized into this kingdom. It's the
[1:03:11] kingdom of God. The kingdom of eternal
[1:03:13] life. We have an eternal king giving
[1:03:15] forth his eternal world is eternal word.
[1:03:19] And we have an eternal people
[1:03:20] predestinated to eternal life. is the
[1:03:23] king. We are baptized into it sitting in
[1:03:26] heavenly glory. AMEN.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; SO YOU CANNOT JOIN THAT KINGDOM. YOU
[1:03:31] CANNOT TAKE YOU CANNOT TAKE YOU CANNOT
[1:03:34] make some exam or do some exam and pass
[1:03:36] those exams to be part and take the
[1:03:38] citizenship of THAT KINGDOM. NO, YOU
[1:03:41] HAVE TO BE BORN IN THAT KINGDOM. YOU
[1:03:43] HAVE TO BE PART OF THAT KINGDOM. YOU
[1:03:45] HAVE TO BE YOU HAVE TO BE BORN. YOU HAVE
[1:03:47] YOU CANNOT JOIN IT. YOU CANNOT TAKE A
[1:03:49] STAMP UPON IT. YOU HAVE TO BE PART OF
[1:03:51] IT. AMEN. YOU HAVE TO BE BORN AND RAISED
[1:03:54] INSIDE OF THAT KINGDOM.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; And Paul Nicodemus came to Jesus and
[1:03:58] asked him, he's asking, "We know that
[1:04:01] you are a master of the law. We know
[1:04:02] that God no man can do what you are
[1:04:04] doing except he has been with God." So
[1:04:06] they knew that he was the Messiah.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; But because of the popularity, because
[1:04:10] of the prestige, because of their pride,
[1:04:12] they didn't want to remove it. They
[1:04:13] didn't want they want to accept it
[1:04:14] publicly. So at least he came he came
[1:04:17] secretly and asking what is happening
[1:04:19] here? And Jesus Christ gave him the key.
[1:04:23] Jesus answered and said unto him,
[1:04:24] "Verily, very verily, I say unto thee,
[1:04:26] except a man be born again, he cannot
[1:04:28] see the kingdom of God." To see is to
[1:04:31] understand the kingdom of God. He cannot
[1:04:33] understand the kingdom of God. It's a
[1:04:35] mystery to him. Yes, you are in this
[1:04:38] world, but because you are born again,
[1:04:40] you can understand the kingdom of God.
[1:04:42] You're in this world, but you are not
[1:04:43] part of this world. Your life is
[1:04:45] different from the life of the other
[1:04:47] people. How are you so different? Oh,
[1:04:49] because yes, I'm a Canadian, but I'm not
[1:04:51] a Canadian. I come from another city. I
[1:04:54] come from another kingdom. I'm part of
[1:04:56] another kingdom. That's why I behave the
[1:04:58] way I'm behaving because I'm a citizen
[1:05:00] of another kingdom. My life is
[1:05:03] different. All the other kingdoms, all
[1:05:04] the other traditions HAVE BEEN BROKEN
[1:05:06] DOWN. I HAVE RECEIVED THE CAPSTONE. I
[1:05:09] HAVE RECEIVED THE CAPSTONE. AMEN. THE
[1:05:12] HEADSHIP IS HERE.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; THANK GOD.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05:18] Nicodemus said unto him, "How can a man
[1:05:20] be born when he's old? Can he enter the
[1:05:22] second time into his mother's womb and
[1:05:24] be born?" Jesus answered, "Verily,
[1:05:27] verily, I say unto you, except a man be
[1:05:29] born of water and of the spirit, he
[1:05:32] cannot enter into the kingdom of God."
[1:05:35] So that we're going to have a baptism of
[1:05:36] the water. First, you have to pass by
[1:05:38] the baptism of the water. Amen. In the
[1:05:41] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, not in
[1:05:43] the name of the father or the son or the
[1:05:45] holy ghost. You cannot. No one has a
[1:05:47] name. Can you ever seen my name is
[1:05:49] father, son, and holy ghost. That's not
[1:05:51] a name. Only titles. Amen.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; So the the name of the father, the name
[1:05:57] of the son, the name of the holy ghost,
[1:05:59] the name of the of of of that person
[1:06:02] there is the lord Jesus Christ. So you
[1:06:05] have to be baptized in the name of the
[1:06:07] lord Jesus Christ. It's like someone
[1:06:09] saying you know go and you if you're
[1:06:13] talking let's say just an example to my
[1:06:14] your wife can the children say oh how
[1:06:17] can how daddy how can I sign here no you
[1:06:20] can sign it in the name of of the father
[1:06:22] just just just sign it in the name of
[1:06:24] the father they're not going to go there
[1:06:26] and sign I'm signing in the name of the
[1:06:28] father no they know their father they
[1:06:30] know the name of their father so they
[1:06:32] say I'm signing in the name of Mr. and
[1:06:35] dala. Amen. Because they know what it
[1:06:38] means. So the same thing for the Lord
[1:06:40] Jesus Christ when he gave the order to
[1:06:42] the disciples, go and be baptized in the
[1:06:44] name of the father, the son of the holy
[1:06:47] ghost. Peter come in in in act 238 he
[1:06:50] says the name of the father, son and
[1:06:52] holy ghost is the lord JESUS CHRIST. YOU
[1:06:55] HAD that revelation. Amen.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; So you can't enter into that kingdom
[1:06:58] unless you be born of the water and of
[1:07:01] the spirit. And the spirit is the new
[1:07:03] birth. Amen.
[1:07:05] Prophet says in his presence, but we
[1:07:07] have we receive a kingdom that cannot be
[1:07:09] moved. Say hallelujah. Everything can be
[1:07:11] shaken will be shaken. The heavens will
[1:07:14] shake. The earth will shake. Earth and
[1:07:16] heaven will pass away. But the word of
[1:07:18] God shall never pass away. Upon this
[1:07:20] rock, I'll build my church and the gates
[1:07:23] of hell will never prevail against it.
[1:07:26] So it's not a man building a church. The
[1:07:28] bride of Jesus Christ is not built upon
[1:07:31] a man. is not built upon a character of
[1:07:33] a man of ideas of a man. It bu is GOD
[1:07:36] HIMSELF BUILDING THE CHURCH. GOD IS
[1:07:40] BUILDING THE CHURCH ON unshakable rock
[1:07:43] of revelation. AMEN. THAT'S WHY IT'S
[1:07:45] IMPORTANT TO HAVE A PERSONAL REVELATION.
[1:07:48] AMEN. YOURSELF HAVE TO COME TO THE place
[1:07:50] say Lord Jesus Christ I believe that the
[1:07:53] word of God is the truth no matter what
[1:07:55] the other one does. SOMETIMES WE ARE
[1:07:58] SHAKEN by what the other person does. So
[1:08:00] if a certain group of people do these
[1:08:02] things and then everybody just follow
[1:08:03] that because they're being they're being
[1:08:06] shaken they're being tossed about
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; go one movement here and then everybody
[1:08:10] goes there everybody goes here that's
[1:08:13] politics you know politician they can
[1:08:15] change that they're checking things
[1:08:17] underneath
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; I know the word sage but I just give
[1:08:22] polling right is it polling yeah
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; polling they're polling the numbers oh
[1:08:28] now the majority think this way. Okay,
[1:08:30] now let's change because we want votes.
[1:08:34] Now the majority is moving this way and
[1:08:36] now let's change.
[1:08:38] So really
[1:08:40] intellectual people, clever people and
[1:08:43] everything, but they're depending on on
[1:08:46] on the people they should lead. Now the
[1:08:50] people are leading them.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; So who's leading us?
[1:08:56] But thank God for the message OF THE
[1:08:58] HOUR. THANK GOD FOR THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:09:00] AMEN. It's the absolute. Doesn't change.
[1:09:03] It is unshakable. It's unmovable. IT'S
[1:09:06] THE STANDARD. IS THE ABSOLUTE. HEAVEN
[1:09:09] AND EARTH WILL PASS AWAY. BUT THE WORD
[1:09:11] OF GOD SHALL NEVER PASS AWAY. LET ME
[1:09:14] STACK MY HEART. LET ME BE CLEAN TO let
[1:09:17] me let let me be let me be LET ME BE
[1:09:19] ATTACHED TO THE WORD OF GOD BECAUSE IF
[1:09:22] I'M ATTACHED TO THE WORD OF GOD, I WILL
[1:09:24] NOT PASS EITHER BECAUSE THE WORD OF GOD
[1:09:26] CAN never pass. Amen.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; And it says everything that can be shook
[1:09:31] will be shaken but we have but we
[1:09:34] receive a kingdom which is the word of
[1:09:36] God himself. So what is the kingdom is
[1:09:38] the word of God himself. God is his
[1:09:41] word. He doesn't he he doesn't shake
[1:09:44] himself. Amen. Oh my. We but we receive
[1:09:47] a kingdom that cannot be moved. It's
[1:09:49] unshakable. Said Paul the Hebrew writer.
[1:09:52] So it's not a man building church. It's
[1:09:54] God himself building the church. And
[1:09:57] then we're talking about the spiritual
[1:09:58] kingdom is not something for the future.
[1:10:00] It's something that is happening right
[1:10:02] now. It has to become a PERSONAL
[1:10:04] REVELATION RIGHT NOW. AMEN. GOD WANT TO
[1:10:07] BUILD THE KINGDOM IN YOUR HEART.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; HIS KINGDOM IN YOUR HEART. DON'T LET
[1:10:12] ANYTHING else build the kingdom in your
[1:10:14] heart. HAVE A STRONGHOLD IN YOUR HEART.
[1:10:17] NO. LET THE STRONGHOLD BE THE WORD OF
[1:10:20] GOD.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; LET THE STRONGHOLD BE THE HOLY SPIRIT.
[1:10:23] AMEN. AMEN.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; LET HIM BE THE MOUNTAIN THAT OCCUPY
[1:10:26] ANYTHING IN YOUR HEART.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; I CANNOT BE SHAKEN. I cannot be moved
[1:10:30] from the principle of the word of God.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:10:39] As Daniel was giving the interpretation
[1:10:41] Daniel 2:44 says, "In the days of these
[1:10:44] kings shall the God of heaven set up a
[1:10:48] kingdom which shall never be destroyed."
[1:10:52] In the days of those kings, in the days
[1:10:55] of as you see Kruchev, as you see
[1:10:59] Eisenhower,
[1:11:01] God shall set up a kingdom that shall
[1:11:04] never be moved. Spiritually speaking,
[1:11:07] that kingdom has already been set.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Is the kingdom of the word of God.
[1:11:13] During the time as they were living
[1:11:14] there, God revealed the word of God in
[1:11:17] the fullness
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; to the point that the bride can never be
[1:11:21] shaken.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Through the ages, we were shaken.
[1:11:24] Sometimes we believe this way and then
[1:11:26] the other people believe this way. Those
[1:11:30] who believe only in grace without works,
[1:11:32] nothing. We usually come to that point
[1:11:34] many times in this church. And I like to
[1:11:36] come to that. No, no, no. Then it's just
[1:11:39] this. No. The other one said, "No, it
[1:11:41] only this because we see it's the word
[1:11:44] of God and they have scriptures on both
[1:11:46] sides, two schools of two doctrines, but
[1:11:48] how can we reconcile both? We we we
[1:11:51] don't know." But we thank God for the
[1:11:53] revelation of the word of God. It give
[1:11:56] the balance in the word of God. So you
[1:11:58] need both. You need the grace of God and
[1:12:00] you need in the manifestation of your
[1:12:02] love towards God. Amen. But what you are
[1:12:05] doing the works can't save you but
[1:12:07] express what is happening inside of you.
[1:12:09] WOMEN. THANK GOD THAT NOW WE CANNOT BE
[1:12:12] SHAKEN ANYMORE.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:12:16] The greatest
[1:12:18] the greatest uh compliment Jesus gave to
[1:12:21] John the Baptist and so when I came and
[1:12:24] John the Baptist and people came the
[1:12:27] disciple of John the Baptist came and
[1:12:28] asked Jesus if John the Baptist is
[1:12:30] wondering are you the one or the other
[1:12:32] one should we wait for another one then
[1:12:34] Jesus Christ didn't send him and send
[1:12:38] them say no go give him this book and go
[1:12:40] then read this way and this way and say
[1:12:42] no just wait and see the prophecies that
[1:12:45] being fulfilled Heal the heal. The heal
[1:12:46] are being sick. The paralytic are being
[1:12:48] healed. The blind can see, the deaf can
[1:12:51] hear, and everything. And when they saw
[1:12:53] that, they reported to John. And John
[1:12:55] believed that he was the messiah. He was
[1:12:57] the king. Amen. Amen. His eyes and he
[1:12:59] got strengthened again. One more time.
[1:13:01] And Jesus Christ instead of criticizing
[1:13:04] John now is giving good testimony. What
[1:13:06] did you go to see there?
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Did you go see an a shaken toss here and
[1:13:13] there? No. is a prophet of God. He knows
[1:13:17] what is the word of God. He's stable,
[1:13:19] unshakable. He could speak so hardly to
[1:13:22] the king, as to the prison, as to the
[1:13:25] soldiers. He was not being shaken by by
[1:13:28] tendency, by the ideas of man. No, he
[1:13:31] stayed faithful. Even cost his life, but
[1:13:33] he could not shake from the word of God.
[1:13:36] SAYS, "AH, THIS IS JOHN the Baptist.
[1:13:39] John the Baptist was the greatest of all
[1:13:41] the PROPHET UNTIL THEN." AMEN. But it
[1:13:43] says those who are born in the kingdom
[1:13:45] of God, THE LEAST OF THEM SHALL BE MORE
[1:13:48] THAN JOHN THE BAPTIST. SO IF WE ARE IN
[1:13:51] THAT KINGDOM, WE ARE MORE THAN JOHN THE
[1:13:53] BAPTIST. IT MEANS WE CAN NEVER BE
[1:13:55] SHAKEN. AMEN. NO MATTER THE PRESSURE OF
[1:13:57] THE OUTSIDE, YOU STAY FAITHFUL TO the
[1:14:00] word OF GOD NO MATTER WHAT.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE FACT THAT YOU ARE HERE DESPITE
[1:14:06] WHAT THE ENEMY HAS TRIED TO PUT UPON
[1:14:08] YOU, IT SHOWS THAT THERE IS SOMETHING
[1:14:10] INSIDE OF YOU THAT CANNOT BE SHAKEN.
[1:14:13] AMEN.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; We go through trials. We go through
[1:14:17] temptation. We go through difficult
[1:14:18] things. And sometimes we feel like no, I
[1:14:21] CAN'T ANYMORE. IT'S LIKE A little boat
[1:14:24] in the middle of the ocean. But you
[1:14:26] know, you've been SHAKEN ON DIFFERENT
[1:14:27] SIDE from the outside. BUT INSIDE THE
[1:14:30] ANCHOR [screaming] HOLD
[1:14:32] SOMETHING IS HOLDING.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; I CANNOT DENY THE WORD OF GOD. IT'S
[1:14:37] TRUE. EVEN THOUGH MY SENSES, what I'm
[1:14:39] seeing and the situation I'm seeing, it
[1:14:41] looks like it's getting from worse to
[1:14:43] worse. BUT THANK GOD FOR THE ANCHOR
[1:14:45] INSIDE. GOD IS KEEPING ME. [screaming]
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT EVEN keeping him. HE'S KEEPING
[1:14:50] ME.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; THE ANCHOR HOLD. IT WILL GIVE YOU THE
[1:14:53] VICTORY.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:04] says, "And in the days of the these
[1:15:06] kings, God of heaven set up a kingdom
[1:15:09] which shall never be destroyed. And the
[1:15:10] kingdom shall not be left to other
[1:15:12] people, but it shall break in pieces and
[1:15:15] consume all these kingdoms, and it shall
[1:15:18] stand forever. For as much as they saw
[1:15:20] as that the stone was cut out of the
[1:15:22] mountain without hands, and that
[1:15:24] breaking in pieces the iron, the brass,
[1:15:27] the clay, the silver, and the gold, the
[1:15:29] great God has made known to the king
[1:15:31] what shall come to pass you after. And
[1:15:33] the dream is certain, and the
[1:15:35] interpretation thereof is sure. I like
[1:15:38] that he had a dream. He was saw the
[1:15:41] symbols. He saw the thing, but he he
[1:15:43] didn't have the interpretation. Now
[1:15:46] Daniel the prophet is telling him the
[1:15:48] dream is certain. I can relate that to
[1:15:50] the seals. You see the seals the symbols
[1:15:53] symbols symbols. Those symbols are
[1:15:56] certain. Thank God they are certain.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; But oh praise be to God. The
[1:16:02] interpretation of those seals is also
[1:16:05] certain. Amen. Is also certain. Is sure.
[1:16:09] Is sure. The interpretation of it is
[1:16:12] sure.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is interpretation of the
[1:16:15] seals symbols is the thunders. Amen. The
[1:16:18] thunders sometimes we get confused and
[1:16:19] say what is a thunder in the message.
[1:16:22] It's so simple. The thunders is the
[1:16:24] content of the seals. The seals are the
[1:16:27] symbols and they have been they've been
[1:16:30] broken. But the content of those seals
[1:16:32] the content of the book is the thunders.
[1:16:34] Amen. So you are not waiting for the
[1:16:36] other thunders. We have already received
[1:16:38] the thunders. Amen. By the word of God
[1:16:40] being by the seals being open, we have
[1:16:43] received the seven thunders in THE
[1:16:45] CHURCH. AMEN. THANK GOD FOR THAT.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT A mystery anymore. It's not
[1:16:50] something you have now to guess. No, to
[1:16:52] assume, to presume. No, it's a
[1:16:54] certainty. IT'S A CERTAIN SOUND.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; So they came and I gone.
[1:17:06] Cruchev came and gone. Eisenhower came
[1:17:09] and gone. Kennedy came and gone. All the
[1:17:13] other one came and gone. During the
[1:17:15] days, God will set up a kingdom. And the
[1:17:17] kingdom is the word of God himself. The
[1:17:20] dominion of the word will reign forever.
[1:17:23] That's why in the days of those king,
[1:17:25] God sent forth the fullness of his word
[1:17:27] to establish the kingdom of the world in
[1:17:29] the heart of his bride. Amen. Daniel
[1:17:33] 7:14 says, "There was given unto him
[1:17:35] dominion and glory and a kingdom that
[1:17:38] all people, nations, and languages
[1:17:40] should serve him. His dominion is an
[1:17:42] everlasting dominion which shall not
[1:17:45] pass away. And his kingdom that we shall
[1:17:47] not be destroyed." And it says, "But the
[1:17:49] saints of the most high shall take the
[1:17:51] kingdom and possess the kingdom forever,
[1:17:54] even forever and ever." Babylon was
[1:17:58] great, but temporary. All human kingdoms
[1:18:00] rise and fall. God's kingdom alone is
[1:18:02] everlasting. It will never be destroyed
[1:18:04] and will be possessed by the saints.
[1:18:06] Amen.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; The world is falling apart. Says,
[1:18:09] remember every falling generation,
[1:18:11] there's only one thing that can bridge
[1:18:12] this world together. That's the word of
[1:18:15] God. The world was made by the word of
[1:18:18] God. It's framed together by the word of
[1:18:20] God. That the only thing that will ever
[1:18:22] keep it together is the word of God. You
[1:18:25] think that the world is staying at the
[1:18:26] level or staying because of what the
[1:18:29] people trying to do? Now let keep the
[1:18:31] conservation and no polution and all
[1:18:34] these things are good. I I I do
[1:18:36] recycling. I I I do that too. I it's
[1:18:39] good thing to do but it's not what we
[1:18:42] are really doing there that is keeping
[1:18:44] the world. No the world is where it is
[1:18:47] because the bride is still here
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; because we are still party. But once the
[1:18:53] bride is gone
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; it's just judgment. It's just smoke
[1:18:57] underneath. the rifle of the of the lamb
[1:18:59] that will be behind. But the world is
[1:19:01] standing today because you and I we are
[1:19:03] still here.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; BUT ONCE WE ARE TAKEN AS IT WAS FOR LOT.
[1:19:07] Once Lot left Sodom and Gomorrah,
[1:19:10] judgment strike SODOM AND GOMORRAH. ONCE
[1:19:12] THE BRIDE IS TAKEN, JUDGMENT WILL STRIKE
[1:19:14] AGAIN.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; BUT THANK GOD FOR THE KINGDOM THAT CAN
[1:19:18] never be shaken.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME TO PRESS ON IN THIS KINGDOM.
[1:19:21] YOU HAVE TO BE PRESSING ON. YOU HAVE TO
[1:19:24] FORCE YOURSELF IN THIS KINGDOM. LORD, I
[1:19:26] WANT AND DESIRE TO BE PART OF THE
[1:19:28] KINGDOM. I DON'T WANT TO COMPROMISE IN
[1:19:31] ANYTHING ON THIS KINGDOM. THE WORD OF
[1:19:33] GOD THAT HAS GIVEN ME IS MY PLACE OF
[1:19:35] SECURITY, OF SAFETY. AMEN.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:44] Listen to what the prophet says. Praise
[1:19:46] be to God. No demon,
[1:19:48] no demon can stand before the infinite
[1:19:50] son of God when his name is brought into
[1:19:53] a challenge by faith. does not and
[1:19:55] cannot fail.
[1:19:57] The angel of the Lord said, "There is
[1:19:59] one that could stand. I could have meant
[1:20:01] that you would have not be shaken, but
[1:20:02] all of them are shaken because only the
[1:20:04] word of God can never fall." And I will
[1:20:06] say this, I know that we all go through
[1:20:08] different trials and some disappoint.
[1:20:10] But one comfort and one solid assurance
[1:20:13] is God word can never fail. God's
[1:20:16] kingdom can never be shaken. My words
[1:20:18] can fail and they will fall. My opinions
[1:20:20] will fail. But God's kingdom, God's word
[1:20:23] would never fail. That what is the
[1:20:25] secret? Stay with the word of God. 2
[1:20:28] Corinthians 4:15 says, "For all things
[1:20:31] are for your sakes, and that the
[1:20:32] abundant grace might through the
[1:20:34] thanksgiving of many redound to the
[1:20:37] glory of God, which cause we faint not,
[1:20:41] but though our outward man perish, yet
[1:20:43] the inward man is renewed day by day."
[1:20:47] For our light affliction, which is but
[1:20:49] for a moment, workketh for us far more
[1:20:51] exceeding and eternal weight of glory.
[1:20:54] While we look not at the things which
[1:20:56] are seen, but at the things which are
[1:20:58] not seen. For the things which are seen
[1:21:00] are temporal, but the things which are
[1:21:02] not seen are eternal.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Isn't that a comfort? [clears throat]
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; The things that we see are only
[1:21:10] temporal. Think about it. Everything
[1:21:13] that we see is temporal. Anything that
[1:21:16] you feel is temporal.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Anything that the the the any all the
[1:21:22] symptoms that you have are temporal.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; But only those who don't don't think
[1:21:27] that you don't see that you want that
[1:21:28] eternal. The word of God that you don't
[1:21:31] see is the only thing that is eternal.
[1:21:34] Don't rely on your on your own
[1:21:37] conception. Don't rely on the symptoms.
[1:21:40] Don't rely on the situation how it looks
[1:21:42] from the outside. Look to the word of
[1:21:45] God. That's the thing that is eternal.
[1:21:48] That the thing that has more value than
[1:21:50] what you see from the outside. Amen. The
[1:21:54] things which are seen are temporal, but
[1:21:56] the things which are not seen are
[1:21:58] eternal.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Our flesh might become old, but the real
[1:22:03] thing is inside of that flesh. Amen.
[1:22:06] Heaven and earth will pass away, but
[1:22:08] God's word will never pass away.
[1:22:13] For he that heareth my word and believe
[1:22:15] on him that sent me has everlasting life
[1:22:17] and he shall never come into
[1:22:18] condemnation is passed from death unto
[1:22:21] life. Jesus made those statement and
[1:22:24] those words after there is no more moon
[1:22:26] nor stars them words will still be in
[1:22:30] effect just as powerful as the way the
[1:22:32] day that he spoke them. His word can
[1:22:35] never fail. Amen.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we think about it and say,
[1:22:41] "Oh, no, but brother B made mistakes.
[1:22:43] Brother Bana made mistakes." But he's
[1:22:46] only a human. And yeah, I a man. A man
[1:22:48] is a human. He made mistakes. I can I
[1:22:51] can even point you to the things he has
[1:22:53] made. Maybe he spelled this he called
[1:22:56] Elijah instead of Elisha.
[1:23:00] But the word of God comes to the
[1:23:02] doctrine. The word of God that he
[1:23:04] preached it is unfailable. The word of
[1:23:07] God is unfailable. Him as a man is a
[1:23:11] mistake. My as a man is a mistake. But
[1:23:12] the word of God can never have mistakes.
[1:23:15] Amen. The word of God is unfailable. So
[1:23:17] you can put your trust upon what the
[1:23:20] word of God says. The doctors might
[1:23:22] fail. The doctor might give you a
[1:23:25] dynamism. But let me tell you, the
[1:23:27] doctors is relying on what he's seeing.
[1:23:30] And what he's seeing is only temporal.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; It's only for a certain time. But God's
[1:23:38] word, if you stay with God words, that
[1:23:40] word is eternal.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Your healing will come from God's word.
[1:23:44] Amen.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; So he will tell you because that only
[1:23:47] thing he has learned and he can only say
[1:23:49] what he has learned. He can he's honest.
[1:23:51] He want to be honest as as he can. But
[1:23:53] God's word is above the report of the
[1:23:55] doctor. Amen. God's word is above the
[1:23:58] report of any other man because God's
[1:24:01] word is eternal. Amen. It cannot change.
[1:24:04] It cannot be moved. I always like that
[1:24:06] experience. I tell that many times of
[1:24:08] that little boy, that little boy was
[1:24:10] sick and called the prophet come to pray
[1:24:12] for him and the parents were waiting for
[1:24:14] the prophet. He just prayed a simple
[1:24:15] prayer and then the signal was showing
[1:24:18] that that boy was dying and the nurses
[1:24:20] and and the parents start rejoicing
[1:24:22] about that. Oh, thank God our boys is
[1:24:24] here. Thank God our voice is healed. And
[1:24:27] and the nurse looked at how can you be
[1:24:29] thanking God when when it's showing
[1:24:32] there in in that machine that the boy is
[1:24:33] dying. According to science never seen a
[1:24:37] person coming back to life from that
[1:24:39] state. It's just showing a signal that
[1:24:41] he's dying. Then the the that old man s
[1:24:44] says that oh nurse I I I know what you
[1:24:48] are looking you are looking at that
[1:24:49] machine and you are right. Look at that
[1:24:51] machine and what I see the same thing
[1:24:53] that you see there. But I see also
[1:24:55] something beyond what my natural eyes
[1:24:57] see there. I see the word of God. By his
[1:25:00] stripes, he's already healed. And God
[1:25:03] has already already paid the price for
[1:25:05] his healing. So he's healed. And he
[1:25:07] continued thanking the Lord. He
[1:25:08] continued thanking THE LORD. THE NEXT
[1:25:11] DAY, THAT BOY WAS OUT OF THE HOSPITAL.
[1:25:14] PRAISE BE TO GOD. AMEN. THE FOLLOWING
[1:25:16] MAYBE IT WAS OUT OF THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE
[1:25:18] HE WAS NOT RELYING on what the signs
[1:25:20] were saying. The word of God can NEVER
[1:25:23] BE SHAKEN. AMEN. HEAVEN AND EARTH WILL
[1:25:25] PASS AWAY BUT GOD'S WORD WILL NEVER PASS
[1:25:28] AWAY.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; So our place of defense is only upon the
[1:25:35] word of God. One thing that is
[1:25:38] impossible for God to do is to fail.
[1:25:41] There's one thing that impossible. We
[1:25:43] say everything is possible but nothing
[1:25:45] one thing that is impossible to God. And
[1:25:48] for God is for God to fail. God can
[1:25:51] never fail his own word. For the Bible
[1:25:53] says, he says he cannot fail. Amen. You
[1:25:56] are the word. You in the beginning was
[1:25:58] the word and the word was with God and
[1:26:00] the word was and the word was made flesh
[1:26:01] and dwells among us in our heart in our
[1:26:04] beings. So God can never destroy his own
[1:26:07] word because he is the word of God.
[1:26:08] Amen.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; So where where the problem is where
[1:26:11] where the problem is? Sometimes the
[1:26:13] problem is we we look we look with our
[1:26:16] natural eyes. We we reason with our
[1:26:18] natural eyes but we believe that God
[1:26:20] give us more faith in the word of God.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Reveal your word on our heart more and
[1:26:24] more. Proverb took this example says I'm
[1:26:28] not defending the devil here but you you
[1:26:31] hear sometimes this expression somebody
[1:26:33] say you know the devil got me. Prophet
[1:26:36] said no he never the devil never got
[1:26:39] you. You went out after him. He never
[1:26:43] come in and got you because you are dead
[1:26:46] and your life is hid in God and sealed
[1:26:48] by the Holy Ghost. The only way he could
[1:26:50] ever get in there is the way the the
[1:26:54] same way you did. So he just invited you
[1:26:57] and you walk out of him. That's all.
[1:26:59] See, it isn't that he come in after you.
[1:27:01] He can't come in there for you are in
[1:27:04] Christ dead yourself. Amen. I'm I'm not
[1:27:07] amening myself. That means so be it. So
[1:27:10] that's true. experienced it and now that
[1:27:12] truth passed from death onto life to
[1:27:14] receive Christ in you. So no, the devil
[1:27:16] got me. I was no this devil really got
[1:27:19] me. No say no. If you are really sealed
[1:27:22] in that kingdom,
[1:27:24] walled in that kingdom, the devil can't
[1:27:26] come there. So he's the one you were
[1:27:29] inside there. He kind of called you. You
[1:27:31] came out of that kingdom and then you
[1:27:34] got trapped.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; So he didn't GET YOU. YOU GET OUT OF IT.
[1:27:38] THAT'S WHY YOU GET TRAPPED. BUT THANK
[1:27:40] GOD we want to decide to stay behind the
[1:27:43] wall of the word of God. Stay with the
[1:27:46] word of God. You will never be defeated
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; because God is the word.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Another place he says
[1:27:58] the same spirit that fell on the day of
[1:27:59] Pentecost that healed the sick back
[1:28:01] there, it's been here in the church all
[1:28:03] the time. But the thing of it is you
[1:28:06] don't know how to make it work for you.
[1:28:08] There is one thing that makes it work is
[1:28:10] faith to believe. When you believe and
[1:28:13] take him at his word, that's the
[1:28:15] lifeline. It cannot fail. If you if you
[1:28:18] would go in the morning and turn on your
[1:28:20] electrical electric iron, some of you
[1:28:24] were meant to start to iron. The first
[1:28:26] thing you know, well, that iron doesn't
[1:28:27] come on. Well, you not go around and say
[1:28:30] there is no such thing as electricity.
[1:28:33] No, you wouldn't do that. There's just
[1:28:34] nothing wrong. You got your wires
[1:28:36] crossed up.
[1:28:39] But oh but but but but
[1:28:42] I believe this and then then this
[1:28:44] doesn't happen. He says no you just stay
[1:28:47] with the word of God. Stay faithful as I
[1:28:49] was encouraging the young people. Just
[1:28:51] stay faithful in the word of God. It
[1:28:53] might take time but stay faithful in the
[1:28:55] word of God. Never move from it. Amen.
[1:28:58] Don't reject the iron because no it's
[1:29:02] not working. No there's no electricity.
[1:29:03] I don't believe in that. No. Just make
[1:29:06] just make the the line be correct. Put
[1:29:10] the mechanic in place. Stay with the
[1:29:12] word of God. One time it will work.
[1:29:15] AMEN. NOT MAYBE TODAY, BUT TOMORROW it
[1:29:17] will work. IF NOT TOMORROW, THE
[1:29:19] FOLLOWING DAY IT WILL WORK. BUT ONE DAY
[1:29:21] IT WILL WORK. Deliverance is on the way
[1:29:24] already. Just stay with the word of God.
[1:29:28] Praise be to God.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; That's why you will say be more sincere.
[1:29:32] That's why he will say pray. That's why
[1:29:34] he will say water the word of God with
[1:29:36] praise and confession. Stay with a
[1:29:39] positive confession. Never move from the
[1:29:42] positive to a negative confession
[1:29:43] because tomorrow it didn't work. No,
[1:29:45] continue staying praising the Lord.
[1:29:47] Thank God for HEALING ME. THANK GOD FOR
[1:29:50] SAVING ME. THANK GOD FOR SAVING MY
[1:29:52] CHILDREN. THANK GOD FOR RESTORING MY
[1:29:54] FAMILY. THANK GOD FOR BRINGING ME TO A
[1:29:57] HIGHER POSITION. THANK GOD FOR
[1:29:59] ESTABLISHING ME IN THE KINGDOM. CONTINUE
[1:30:02] TO CLAIM THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; DON'T STAY DISCOURAGED. AMEN. DON'T STAY
[1:30:06] DISAPPOINTED. AMEN. AMEN.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Why it cannot fall? All of these is to
[1:30:16] allow the kingdom of God to be
[1:30:18] established. Sometimes God want to see
[1:30:20] that our reaction and just see how we
[1:30:23] are going to react. But he our reaction
[1:30:26] has to be always the word of God. God's
[1:30:29] word will never fail. It will always
[1:30:32] come to pass. We look in the Bible. Look
[1:30:34] at the the three Hebrew children. They
[1:30:37] just confess the word of God.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; They didn't have a dust of the Lord. The
[1:30:42] fire will not burn you. No, they just
[1:30:44] stay with the word of God. The king says
[1:30:46] that it was one of the greatest kingdom.
[1:30:48] As I mentioned, it was one the greatest
[1:30:50] of all the kingdom. The same spirit of
[1:30:53] Babylon there is the same spirit that is
[1:30:55] working here. Satan doesn't change. It's
[1:30:57] still the same Satan. Still the same
[1:30:59] devil. Just changing maybe strategies
[1:31:02] here and there, but it's still the same
[1:31:03] devil. The same devil want you to work
[1:31:06] for him. He want you to worship him. He
[1:31:08] want him to put a first thing before
[1:31:10] him, an idol that you put something that
[1:31:13] have preminence upon the word of God. He
[1:31:15] want you want he want you to he he want
[1:31:18] he want you to soul to sell your s your
[1:31:21] soul your to sell your soul to him. If
[1:31:24] you look in the book of re revelation,
[1:31:26] it's actually amazing. So the beast she
[1:31:28] she she even bought the souls of people.
[1:31:31] They became so slave and everything in
[1:31:34] their mind in their bodies even to the
[1:31:37] point of the soul
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; because they gave everything to the new
[1:31:40] kingdom to the new ideas and new things.
[1:31:43] But God says no don't worship that idol
[1:31:46] there.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Don't worship everybody has to worship
[1:31:52] this idol. Those two children says no we
[1:31:55] are not going to worship that. The king
[1:31:57] say you are not going to worship you are
[1:31:58] not going to follow my rules. Say no we
[1:32:01] are not going to worship that. So do you
[1:32:03] know that you are going to be burning
[1:32:04] that fire
[1:32:06] [snorts] even if we have to go to the
[1:32:08] fire. We are not going to worship this
[1:32:10] idol. We are not going to submit ourself
[1:32:12] to Laia. No no no no. We are going TO
[1:32:16] WORSHIP ONLY ONE GOD. ONE TRUE GOD IS
[1:32:18] THE LORD JESUS CHRIST.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; NOT EVEN THE PROPHET. NOT EVEN ONLY THE
[1:32:23] LORD JESUS CHRIST IS the only true God.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; And the king says that because you have
[1:32:28] done that, I'm going to send you into
[1:32:30] the fire. And you know the story, right?
[1:32:32] Send them as they're going through the
[1:32:34] fire there.
[1:32:36] Praise be to God. I LIKE THEIR
[1:32:37] TESTIMONY. KING, EVEN IF HE does not
[1:32:40] deliver us, we will not worship that
[1:32:43] idol.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Even if he does not deliver us, but we
[1:32:46] will not worship that idol. We will stay
[1:32:48] true to the word of God. We will not
[1:32:50] compromise with the kingdom of God. WE
[1:32:53] ARE NOT PART OF WE ARE NOT BABYLONIANS.
[1:32:55] WE ARE NOT PEOPLE OF THE LEODYSIA. WE
[1:32:57] ARE CITIZENS of the kingdom of God.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Those who are carrying them got
[1:33:04] destroyed. But them they were not
[1:33:06] destroyed. The good news is the angel
[1:33:09] was already there
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; waiting for them.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; In your trials you are going through the
[1:33:14] angel is already there
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; waiting for you.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; SO IT'S NOT YOUR BATTLE. IS GOD'S
[1:33:19] BATTLE.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; AS YOU STAY WITH THE WORD OF GOD, IT
[1:33:22] CHANGE FROM YOUR BATTLE TO BECOME GOD'S
[1:33:24] BATTLE. AMEN.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; IF YOU LEAVE THE WORD OF GOD AND BECOMES
[1:33:28] YOUR OWN BATTLE. OH, AND GOOD LUCK TO
[1:33:30] YOU IF IT BECOMES YOUR OWN BATTLE. BUT I
[1:33:32] DON'T WANT IT TO BE MY OWN BATTLE. I
[1:33:34] WANT TO BE THE LORD'S BATTLE.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL HAS TO CHALLENGE THE WORD OF
[1:33:38] GOD. I'M TAKING THE WORD OF GOD. I'M
[1:33:41] STAYING WITH THE WORD OF GOD. THEN GOD
[1:33:43] WILL FIGHT FOR ME. AMEN. AMEN.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; As they go into that fire, he was
[1:33:49] already there. The fourth man was
[1:33:51] already there cooling the fire.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; As they drop down in there, they found
[1:33:56] him already there.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus Christ, he didn't send
[1:33:59] any angel. Himself came THERE
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; IN YOUR TRIALS. HIMSELF IS [screaming]
[1:34:04] THERE.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; HE'S WAITING FOR YOU THERE TO COMFORT
[1:34:08] YOU, TO GIVE YOU VICTORY. AMEN. AND HE
[1:34:11] WILL GIVE YOU VICTORY. The prophet says
[1:34:14] sometimes those trials that you put us
[1:34:16] there is to break the chain as we are
[1:34:18] there. The fire that was supposed to
[1:34:20] destroy them, it destroys the chain they
[1:34:23] WERE BOUND TO.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; THANK GOD SOMETIMES FOR THOSE TRIALS to
[1:34:27] show the great victory of God.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; So we need to be translating that
[1:34:39] kingdom. Romans 14. Give me a few
[1:34:43] minutes here. Romans 14:17. For the
[1:34:45] kingdom of God is not me is not meat and
[1:34:47] drink, but righteousness and peace and
[1:34:50] joy in the Holy Spirit.
[1:34:53] So I can walk in this kingdom of the
[1:34:55] Messiah. It's an inheritance. I didn't
[1:34:57] touch the part of the inheritance. But
[1:34:59] it is your inheritance.
[1:35:03] Prophet says world is falling apart. The
[1:35:06] good thing about it, friend, is think of
[1:35:08] this. Before we get to this kingdom,
[1:35:10] before this kingdom, this king comes
[1:35:13] now, we can set together in heavenly
[1:35:16] places in Christ Jesus, lifted above,
[1:35:20] lifted up above all the shadows of all
[1:35:23] the corruption of the world and all the
[1:35:26] television programs.
[1:35:28] Listen how it's so we are in the
[1:35:30] kingdoms here. But says, "No, before the
[1:35:33] king comes, before we go into the
[1:35:35] millennium, we can set together in
[1:35:37] heavenly places in Christ Jesus, lifted
[1:35:40] up above all the shadows of all the
[1:35:42] corruption of the world and all the
[1:35:44] television programs and all these other
[1:35:46] nonsense they got in the earth today and
[1:35:49] all the rotten pollution and systems and
[1:35:51] everything be lifted up in heavenly
[1:35:53] places. The Holy Spirit himself come
[1:35:56] upon us and speak out and call to us our
[1:35:59] sins and tell us how to get straighten
[1:36:01] up and what we have done in life and
[1:36:04] what we are doing. It's the Holy Spirit.
[1:36:06] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today
[1:36:08] and forever. That's the king that shall
[1:36:10] come to this kingdom someday. And his
[1:36:13] kingdom is now being established in the
[1:36:16] hearts of his people here on earth.
[1:36:20] Oh God, let your kingdom be established
[1:36:23] in my heart.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; I'm going to the kingdom
[1:36:29] that that king established into my
[1:36:30] heart. It's like someone is traveling
[1:36:34] gosh when he was traveling he was his
[1:36:37] heart was already in Burundi. The body
[1:36:41] is here but his heart is already there.
[1:36:43] So oh I'm going there that that's where
[1:36:45] my mind is. That's where his plan is
[1:36:47] there. Everything is there. He's
[1:36:49] planning for it. Amen.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; That's the same thing for us. We might
[1:36:53] be here, but our heart is already caught
[1:36:55] up. Translate it into that kingdom.
[1:36:58] Already caught up in that kingdom. Amen.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; You can't go in that kingdom if that
[1:37:02] kingdom is not in you. You are going
[1:37:05] that kingdom because that kingdom is
[1:37:07] already in you. Amen.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Says his kingdom is now being
[1:37:10] established in the heart of his people
[1:37:12] here on earth.
[1:37:15] Ephesians 6:11-13, "Put on the whole arm
[1:37:19] of God that you may be able to stand
[1:37:21] against the viles of the devil." But
[1:37:23] Victor touched on Wednesday. For we
[1:37:25] wrestle not against the flesh and blood,
[1:37:27] but against principalities, against
[1:37:29] powers, against the rulers of the
[1:37:31] darkness of this world, against
[1:37:32] spiritual weaknesses in the high places.
[1:37:34] But for take on upon you the whole armor
[1:37:37] of God, that you may be able to stand in
[1:37:39] the evil day, and having done all to
[1:37:41] stand. So it's a fight of powers, the
[1:37:44] fight of kingdoms, but we want the
[1:37:46] kingdom of God to be established. That
[1:37:49] little revelation that is in your heart
[1:37:51] there,
[1:37:53] let it grow, become a mountain.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; So Lord, add revelation upon revelation,
[1:37:59] word upon word, spirit upon spirit. Fill
[1:38:03] me more of you, Lord. One baptism but
[1:38:06] many refilling. Fill me with more of
[1:38:07] you, Lord. Let the word of God take
[1:38:09] prereeminence. Let the word of God take
[1:38:12] take control. Father, I want you to be
[1:38:14] in the place where you are taking
[1:38:16] control. Not me taking control, but you
[1:38:18] taking control in my heart, in my
[1:38:20] desires, in my ambitions, in my
[1:38:22] decisions. Let you have the preeminence,
[1:38:25] Lord Jesus Christ. So, we're looking for
[1:38:27] a kingdom and we do receive now a
[1:38:30] kingdom that cannot be moved. The world
[1:38:32] is falling apart. We receive something
[1:38:34] into our heart. There is no not devil,
[1:38:37] devils in hell can shake it out. there's
[1:38:40] nothing. So, end of quote there. Think
[1:38:43] about it. It's not that we will receive
[1:38:45] it, but we have received the kingdom.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about those who are born
[1:38:50] again. We have received a kingdom.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Those who are born again, you can if you
[1:38:55] have received that kingdom, you can
[1:38:56] never perish
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; as God can never perish.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; The word perish does not belong to a
[1:39:02] born again Christians. You can never
[1:39:04] perish. As is I'll just touch the word
[1:39:08] perish for a moment here. The Matthew
[1:39:09] 8:26 20 22 26 says when he was entered
[1:39:14] into a ship the disciples followed him
[1:39:16] and behold there arose a great tempest
[1:39:17] in the sea in so much that they the
[1:39:19] sheep was covered with the waves and and
[1:39:21] he was asleep his disciples came to him
[1:39:23] and they woke him say Lord SAVE US WE
[1:39:26] PERISH THAT'S WHERE WE perish that's
[1:39:28] usually sometimes how it comes in our
[1:39:30] mind I'm going through these THINGS I'M
[1:39:33] PERISHING no a Christian can never
[1:39:36] perish
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; as long as in the boat. You can never
[1:39:40] perish. What you need IS TO WAKE HIM UP.
[1:39:43] OH LORD JESUS CHRIST, LOOK IN THIS
[1:39:45] SITUATION AND COME WAKE UP. OH LORD
[1:39:47] JESUS, INTERVENE IN THIS SITUATION. TAKE
[1:39:50] JESUS CHRIST OUT OF HISTORY. MAKE HIM
[1:39:52] PRESENT TODAY. [screaming]
[1:39:54] THE SAME MIRACLE THAT HAPPENED THE TIME
[1:39:56] OF BROTHER. THE SAME MIRACLE HAPPENED
[1:39:58] TODAY.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; TAKE JESUS CHRIST OUT OF HISTORY. BRING
[1:40:01] HIM INTO LIFE TODAY. WAKE JESUS CHRIST.
[1:40:04] You can never perish.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Jesus replied says, "And he
[1:40:08] said unto him, why are you fearful, oh
[1:40:10] ye of little faith?"
[1:40:14] Then he rose and rebuked the winds and
[1:40:15] the sea and there was a great calm.
[1:40:20] Perish does not apply to the believers.
[1:40:23] We can never perish as God can never
[1:40:24] perish. John 3 says, "Whosoever believes
[1:40:28] on him shall not perish but have eternal
[1:40:31] life." Amen.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; For God so loved the world that he gave
[1:40:34] his only begotten son that whosoever
[1:40:36] believers on him should not perish but
[1:40:38] have everlasting life. A Christian can
[1:40:41] never perish. He is not perishable.
[1:40:44] There is no expiry date for a believer.
[1:40:47] For a born again Christian, a born again
[1:40:50] Christian is eternal. Amen. He
[1:40:52] [clears throat] can never die as God
[1:40:54] cannot die. Prophecies in thirsting FOR
[1:40:57] LIFE. THEREFORE, GOD had no beginning
[1:40:59] and yet had no ending. And if we become
[1:41:02] part of God, we can no more die than God
[1:41:05] can die because we've got his life in us
[1:41:08] by the new birth. We just as eternal as
[1:41:12] God is eternal.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; For me, THAT'S A POWERFUL STATEMENT.
[1:41:17] THANK GOD. YOU ARE ETERNAL AS GOD is
[1:41:20] eternal. YOU ARE PART OF GOD. YOU CAN
[1:41:22] NEVER PERISH. IF GOD PUT THAT KINGDOM
[1:41:24] INSIDE OF YOU, it means you have been
[1:41:26] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:41:28] the world, you can never perish as God
[1:41:31] can never perish.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; John 10. And I give unto them eternal
[1:41:36] life and they shall never perish.
[1:41:38] Neither shall any man pluck them out of
[1:41:40] my hand.
[1:41:42] No one can pluck you out of the hand
[1:41:46] because you have received that that
[1:41:48] stone that was cut without any help of
[1:41:51] any man. It was not it was not your
[1:41:53] father who saved you. It was not your
[1:41:55] husband who saved you. It was not the
[1:41:56] children who saved you. It's not even
[1:41:58] the pastor who saved you. It's not a
[1:41:59] minister who saved you. It's not a
[1:42:01] prophet who saved you. It was that stone
[1:42:04] cut with the help with not help of any
[1:42:06] man but God himself. He put something
[1:42:09] inside of you and he want that to grow
[1:42:12] come to the fullness of the of the
[1:42:14] capstone.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; It says neither shall any man pluck them
[1:42:19] out of my hand. My father which gave
[1:42:21] them me is greater than them all. And no
[1:42:25] man is able to pluck them out of my
[1:42:27] father's hand. Are tribulation going to
[1:42:30] take out take you out of God's hand? No.
[1:42:33] Sickness going to take you out of God's
[1:42:35] hand? No. Deception will take you out?
[1:42:38] No. No. Nothing can separate you from
[1:42:40] God.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Nothing can take you out of God's hand
[1:42:44] because you are part of him already. Can
[1:42:47] never pass. You can never change. You
[1:42:49] can never change. Once you are in that
[1:42:51] kingdom, he can never take you out of
[1:42:53] that kingdom. No one can make you change
[1:42:56] your identity once you are part of that
[1:42:59] kingdom. No one can take you and make
[1:43:01] another citizen. Once you are part of
[1:43:03] that kingdom, you are part of God's
[1:43:05] economy. DO YOU LOVE the Lord this
[1:43:07] morning?
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU THANK GOD FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE
[1:43:10] FOR YOU?
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR THAT KINGDOM THAT CANNOT
[1:43:13] BE SHAKEN.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR THE PROMISE OF GOD. AMEN.
[1:43:16] SOMETIMES YOU CAN HAVE SOME TRIALS. YOU
[1:43:18] KNOW WHAT TRIALS DO? Trials do for for a
[1:43:22] tree that doesn't have any trial.
[1:43:25] His roots are not getting deeper.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; But a tree sometimes you go through wind
[1:43:30] and tempest and every time that you see
[1:43:33] a trial coming, that tree is putting the
[1:43:35] root deeper deeper deeper deeper deeper
[1:43:39] deeper DEEPER DEEPER DEEPER. THANK GOD
[1:43:42] THAT YOU ARE HELPING ME TO PUT my roots
[1:43:44] deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper,
[1:43:46] deeper because I CANNOT BE SHAKEN. I
[1:43:50] CANNOT BE MOVED. I'M planted near the
[1:43:53] river of THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; I CAN NEVER BE MOVED.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR THE kingdom that can never
[1:43:59] be shaken.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; The world will die, but I will not die.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; I will keep pressing on.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; God bless you richly. Amen.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Let's give a hand to the Lord this
[1:44:09] morning. Amen.

[1:54:09] Your love, your life [singing and music]

[1:54:47] I know okay I'm losing but um all the

[1:54:54] You're not [music]
[1:54:57] exactly

[1:56:47] [singing]
[1:56:49] [music]

[1:56:59] I [music]
[1:57:03] praise his righteousness [singing]
[1:57:06] alone who rest to stand [music] before
[1:57:11] the throne.
[1:57:13] Oh Christ is holy
[1:57:16] [music] for Christ. Oh, and the ground
[1:57:20] is [singing] sinking sand.
[1:57:23] All [music]
[1:57:24] the ground is sinking sand.
[1:57:30] She ready. [music]
[1:57:35] As the sister comes, I just want to read
[1:57:38] Act chapter 2.
[1:57:46] You can have a seat for a moment just
[1:57:51] act chapter 2 is when Peter was
[1:57:53] mentioned when I was
[1:57:56] preaching came Acts 2:37 he was
[1:58:00] preaching and telling them that they
[1:58:01] crucified the Messiah.
[1:58:03] So they when they heard what what was
[1:58:06] preached 37
[1:58:09] the Bible says then when they heard this
[1:58:12] that's why the baptism has to come after
[1:58:14] you have heard the word of God you
[1:58:18] cannot baptize a child doesn't know the
[1:58:21] word of God it's nothing you can repent
[1:58:23] about so it's nothing to prickle the
[1:58:26] heart there's nothing to make him take a
[1:58:28] decision so that's why when we were
[1:58:31] baptized in the Catholic as a child it
[1:58:33] was wrong because was not according to
[1:58:36] the word of God.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; So um you have to hear the word of God
[1:58:40] and align with the word of God. Accept
[1:58:42] the word of God. Say God your word is
[1:58:44] the truth and then what you manifest
[1:58:48] decision in your heart. What something
[1:58:49] happened in your heart. The baptism is
[1:58:51] an expression of what has happened in
[1:58:53] your heart that you you show it publicly
[1:58:56] that now I am decided to follow the Lord
[1:58:59] Jesus Christ. Amen. So when they heard
[1:59:02] this, they were pricricked in their
[1:59:04] heart and said unto Peter and to the
[1:59:06] rest of the apostles, men and brethren,
[1:59:09] what shall we do? Then Peter said unto
[1:59:12] them, repent. Repent first. So the
[1:59:15] baptism have to start by a true
[1:59:17] repentance. Repentance means is a change
[1:59:20] of directions. Means I've going this
[1:59:22] direction. I realize now it's a wrong
[1:59:24] direction. Maybe you are not sinful. Not
[1:59:26] not necessarily that you are a wrong
[1:59:28] person like the our dear is a Christian
[1:59:31] is coming is a very nice little girl
[1:59:35] I I I like her a lot very sweet and nice
[1:59:38] and no she's a she didn't anything wrong
[1:59:42] many speaking said but she realized no I
[1:59:44] can't depend on my own lord I make a
[1:59:47] decisions to follow you this is a public
[1:59:49] expressions of what I have in my heart
[1:59:52] amen
[1:59:54] says uh repent Repent and be baptized
[1:59:57] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[1:59:59] Christ for the remission of sins, the
[2:00:03] forgiveness of sins and then and you
[2:00:06] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[2:00:09] Ghost.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; So there's a promise if you baptized is
[2:00:12] a manifestation from what happened in
[2:00:14] your heart and God is bound to his own
[2:00:16] word to give you the gift of the Holy
[2:00:19] Ghost and he will give you the gift of
[2:00:21] the Holy Ghost. I like the next part
[2:00:23] too. For the promise is unto you, said
[2:00:26] to the one he was talking to. And I
[2:00:27] said, even to you, not only to you, but
[2:00:29] to your children as well, and to all
[2:00:32] that are a far off, even as many as the
[2:00:35] Lord our God shall call. And God is
[2:00:38] still calling today.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Christian is is a response of the call
[2:00:43] of God. And she's answering God. Thank
[2:00:45] God for the answer. Thank God for the
[2:00:48] word of God. Now I respond to that word.
[2:00:50] Amen. And with many others word did he
[2:00:53] testify and exhort, saying, "Save
[2:00:54] yourself from this untored untored
[2:00:57] generation." And then they that gladly
[2:01:00] received his word were baptized.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; And the same day they were added unto
[2:01:05] them about 3,000 souls. Today one soul
[2:01:10] will be added. Amen.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; And as we are rejoicing, the angels are
[2:01:14] rejoicing. Thank God we have one who
[2:01:17] came into the kingdom of God.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Thank God.
[2:01:21] So, Satan is defeated one more time.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; And we show that to the devil that thank
[2:01:26] God, God has called someone today. Amen.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; That's my go again to Romans.
[2:01:35] Romans 6.
[2:01:42] Romans 6 chapter Romans chapter 6 verse3
[2:01:48] says know ye not that so many of us as
[2:01:52] were baptized into Jesus Christ were
[2:01:55] baptized into his death therefore we are
[2:01:57] buried with him by baptism unto death
[2:02:01] that like as Christ was raised up from
[2:02:03] the dead by the glory of the father even
[2:02:06] so we also should walk in newness of
[2:02:09] life
[2:02:10] for if we have being planted together in
[2:02:12] the likeness of his death. We shall be
[2:02:15] also in the likeness of his
[2:02:17] resurrection.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; So the baptism is not only uh a sprinkle
[2:02:22] in the head. That's not baptism.
[2:02:24] Actually baptism comes from the Greek
[2:02:26] word if I'm not mistaken Greek word
[2:02:28] means immersed. You have to be immersed
[2:02:30] completely. So it's a sign of completely
[2:02:33] death. So you die completely under
[2:02:36] that's your old that your past that your
[2:02:39] nature you die to the old nature and
[2:02:41] then you come out in the newness of life
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; as a symbol now it's a new person the
[2:02:47] one the old Christian is gone will be
[2:02:49] gone now the new Christian will come out
[2:02:51] amen through the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; that's why the baptism has to be through
[2:02:56] the water completely under immersion
[2:02:59] amen you have you will help me give you
[2:03:01] some soft good songs Bring them in.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; Bring them in.
[2:03:09] Bring them in.
