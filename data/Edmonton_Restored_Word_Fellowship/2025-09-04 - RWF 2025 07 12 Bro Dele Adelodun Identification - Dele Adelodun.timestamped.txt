[37:55] we return thanksgiving unto you tonight.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; For yet another privilege
[38:02] to be in your presence together. Thank
[38:05] you for your grace that has been keeping
[38:07] the saints here and the keeping every
[38:10] one of us in our individual quarters and
[38:13] that same grace has brought us together
[38:16] one more time.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Lord, we want to appreciate you for it.
[38:20] We thank you for the worship of the
[38:23] saints tonight. Uh Lord, this
[38:26] thanksgiving and praises have proceeded
[38:29] forth out of grateful hearts. Father, I
[38:32] pray that you will accept them. May you
[38:35] also accept our person that nothing, oh
[38:39] God, will stand between our soul and the
[38:41] savior.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; Come by one more time. Break the bread
[38:46] of life in your own manner, oh God. That
[38:49] our eyes of understanding will be
[38:52] illuminated
[38:54] &gt;&gt; and we shall become lighfooted.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. with cares and bodies and
[38:58] anxieties ruled away
[39:01] &gt;&gt; to go and declare the proof that indeed
[39:03] you are not dead,
[39:05] &gt;&gt; you are risen.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; Do it for us tonight. Move through the
[39:10] audience of your people,
[39:12] &gt;&gt; but don't pass no one by.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; May you stop at the post of each person.
[39:18] May you discern their needs
[39:20] &gt;&gt; and grant to them the substance of their
[39:22] requests and bless their desires. May
[39:26] their coming to thy house tonight never
[39:28] be in vain.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Help us is our prayer.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; At the end of the service, may we have
[39:34] cause to give you praise.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; May we give you glory.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; We want to trust you for souls that may
[39:40] be coming on their way that you will
[39:42] guide their path here safely.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; Maybe one way or the other others are
[39:47] connected with us. May they be a
[39:50] partaker of the life blessings such as
[39:53] we shall receive. Perhaps some saints
[39:56] are also gathering tonight like we are.
[39:59] We pray that your presence that is with
[40:01] us we also abide with them
[40:04] &gt;&gt; that both there and here we shall be
[40:06] thankful
[40:07] &gt;&gt; at the end of all things tonight. Grant
[40:10] it is our prayer as we commit ourselves
[40:13] this time and thy word into thy care in
[40:16] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord bless you, saints.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, I don't keep us standing. I'll
[40:30] just humbly request that we read the
[40:33] Bible.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; Then when we take the comfort of our
[40:36] seats, I will greet us as I should.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord bless you. You're
[40:40] welcome. Amen.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; If you have your Bibles with you, please
[40:44] turn to the book of John 5 verse 39.
[40:52] John chapter 5, the 39th verse.
[41:12] If you are there, say amen.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:16] Search the scriptures,
[41:19] for in them ye think ye have eternal
[41:22] life, and they are they which testify of
[41:26] me.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; May the Lord add his blessings to the
[41:30] reading of his holy word. Amen. God
[41:33] bless you. You may please be seated.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; I want to thank the Lord tonight for
[41:40] making it possible for me to be in the
[41:43] midst of the believers
[41:45] &gt;&gt; in this part of the world.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; I thank God for granting it and uh I
[41:52] want to appreciate uh our dear pastors
[41:56] as it were.
[41:58] Amen. Uh my first pastor here is brother
[42:03] CL. Amen. God bless you sir. Amen. And
[42:08] uh now I have brother Moses.
[42:11] Amen. And uh I thank them for extending
[42:16] this arm of love to me
[42:18] &gt;&gt; to come and be of servicemen
[42:21] &gt;&gt; trusting to God that somewhere along the
[42:23] line we can be of a blessing. I bring
[42:26] the greetings of the saints back in
[42:28] Nigeria.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Everyone is doing well. My wife, the
[42:33] children and all the members of my
[42:35] house, they all send their greetings.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; The local assembly that I represent also
[42:41] send their greetings.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; And uh I came into Canada on Wednesday.
[42:48] We had a service at Calgary on Wednesday
[42:51] and we had another one yesterday in
[42:54] Leedbridge before I traveled down here
[42:57] today. All the saints along that line
[43:01] also pass their regards to every one of
[43:03] you here.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; So it's nice to see you all again. Both
[43:08] the old faces that I know and the new
[43:11] faces I'm getting acquainted with. Is
[43:13] that brother Lucky?
[43:15] Okay. Wonderful. God bless you. Amen.
[43:19] God bless every one of you. God bless
[43:21] you, my brother. Amen. And uh I am sure
[43:25] glad to see everybody and I trust that
[43:28] the Lord will bless our time together.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. So for a little exhortation
[43:35] tonight, I would like to speak on
[43:37] identification.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; Identification. And uh if time permits
[43:43] and God help us, I want to look at it
[43:46] from three angles. Uh we identifying
[43:49] ourselves in the Bible. That is we
[43:53] identifying ourselves in the Bible.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; When we are inspired to locate our
[43:59] identity,
[44:00] &gt;&gt; it's very important. We shall start from
[44:03] there tonight. Then uh also the word
[44:07] identifying who we are. That is the
[44:10] second aspect. Amen. The word
[44:13] identifying who we are. And number three
[44:17] is uh who we also identify with.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Very very important.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; If time permits uh we will see how God
[44:26] will help us. But if I do not finish and
[44:30] God did not lead that way tomorrow, I
[44:32] will leave the rest to brother Moses to
[44:34] continue.
[44:36] I'm used to giving assignments to the
[44:38] local pastor.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; So, brother Moses be on guard. Amen. The
[44:43] Lord bless you, sir.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; Now, I took inspiration for this subject
[44:47] from, you know, the message of the
[44:50] prophet himself on identification.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; But something struck me uh I don't know
[44:56] if it's possible to put it on the board,
[44:58] but if it's not, I will just read.
[45:01] Something struck me in two of the
[45:03] quotations where the prophet was
[45:05] speaking on identification. He preached
[45:08] identification about three or four
[45:11] places. Amen. And uh in one of the
[45:14] places the one he preached uh 63-0123
[45:20] 63- 0123 paragraph 33 it said may the
[45:25] Lord add his blessings uh to the reading
[45:28] of his word. I would like to take for a
[45:32] few minutes of your time on what I would
[45:35] call or like to say a text called
[45:39] identification.
[45:41] Identifying.
[45:43] Identified in the likeness of Bible
[45:47] characters.
[45:49] Being identified in the likeness of
[45:52] Bible characters. Then in paragraph 35
[45:55] he says, "I'm sure tonight that we ought
[45:59] to find ourselves somewhere in some
[46:02] character of the Bible so that we will
[46:05] know the outcome of that character and
[46:08] know what our outcome will be.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; That is what struck me." Now, Apostle
[46:16] Paul said he was speaking about Paul and
[46:19] the rest, you know, of the characters of
[46:22] the scripture and it described their
[46:24] life as an allegory
[46:27] unto us. Some call it allegory,
[46:29] whichever one you call it. And when you
[46:31] look at the meaning of that, it's an
[46:34] event taking place not for itself, but
[46:38] something taking place now to speak of a
[46:41] future.
[46:43] So that follows that the life of Paul
[46:46] and most of these characters of the
[46:48] Bible that we are reading for an example
[46:51] are mere shadows.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; They are prophecies.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; And today we to whom the end of the
[47:00] world are come are the fulfillment of
[47:02] those prophecies.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; In fact our life will explain their own
[47:08] life better. Amen.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; The details we didn't get from their
[47:13] life, we shall get by our life.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; You know why? If you look at a shadow,
[47:19] all shadows look black.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[47:23] &gt;&gt; They don't give so much details, but you
[47:26] will. The shadow can tell enough as to
[47:28] show you the shape of the object you are
[47:30] looking at.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; But the color of that object, you cannot
[47:34] see by shadow. But when the real
[47:36] substance come, the substance gives the
[47:39] entire detail of what the shadow is
[47:42] projecting.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; So we become the entire details of all
[47:46] the Bible characters who are seeds of
[47:50] God.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; That is why the Bible said they without
[47:54] us
[47:56] &gt;&gt; the number is not complete. We represent
[47:59] the church of the capstone that will put
[48:02] perfection on the entire work of God
[48:05] bringing redemption to mankind
[48:07] throughout all the ages.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; So something struck me here. He said if
[48:12] we could look at the characters of the
[48:15] Bible and see what their outcome turn
[48:18] out to be, we will have an idea of what
[48:22] our own outcome will be.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Because if you are seeing the shadow of
[48:29] an elephant, when the substance come, it
[48:32] will not be a rat.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; You agree with me on that, church?
[48:37] &gt;&gt; It's going to be an elephant with better
[48:40] details.
[48:43] All right, let's go gradually
[48:46] then in the identification the one he
[48:48] preached in 1964 paragraph 27 he said I
[48:52] just you know he was uh giving us a
[48:55] background here he was talking about a
[48:57] young boy who hadn't seen a mirror
[49:00] before
[49:01] and uh he was raised in the village but
[49:04] during occasions it came with a mother
[49:08] to see the aunt in the city And as they
[49:11] were walking up the steps, you know, uh,
[49:14] in the stairway, uh, there was a
[49:17] standing mirror, you know, facing them.
[49:21] So this boy, as he was walking up the
[49:23] steps, he saw another boy walking up the
[49:26] steps.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; And he was thinking somebody was coming
[49:29] to meet him.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; But by the time he got near the mirror
[49:33] and stood, the boy also stood.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Then he was watching. Now, he couldn't
[49:39] immediately realize that that was him
[49:42] because he hasn't seen his own face
[49:44] before.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; It was his first time of seeing a
[49:47] mirror. So, he waved at the boy. The boy
[49:51] waved back at him.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; He smiled, the boy smiled. He jumped,
[49:56] the boy jumped. Everything he did, the
[49:59] boy did. Then he turned to mama. He
[50:01] said, "Mama, that's me."
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So the prophet says, "So I
[50:07] just wonder today if we couldn't look in
[50:10] the Bible and say that's me
[50:14] &gt;&gt; as we wonder which one is it."
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Which character in the Bible
[50:19] would we look like? Because the Bible is
[50:22] a mirror.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; When we come in here, we either come for
[50:25] treatment or for check off.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; That is why this is God's grace clinic.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; And that is why he is called the great
[50:33] physician.
[50:35] The sick people comes for treatment in
[50:37] the clinic. But if you see a healthy man
[50:39] come to the clinic, he is coming for
[50:41] check off.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you are healthy tonight, you
[50:45] need a checkup.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; If you are sick tonight, you need a
[50:48] healing.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; And the gospel does all.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; The Bible does all because it's the
[50:53] mirror that X-rays our life and show us
[50:56] our picture. May the Lord be our help
[50:58] tonight.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Which character would look like? And uh
[51:03] let's just take that for a little text
[51:05] now and stay with it for a while. As we
[51:08] look into God's word, let's identify
[51:11] ourselves
[51:13] for he give others in there for examples
[51:17] of what we are.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Are you following church?
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Now remember that God takes his spirit
[51:25] or takes his men but never his spirit.
[51:29] Satan takes his man but never his
[51:32] spirit. So let's see if we can identify
[51:35] our present state now with Bible
[51:38] characters. The Bible said all those
[51:40] things happened back in those days for
[51:42] example for us they are examples. So
[51:45] it's a cardinal strong touch that the
[51:47] prophet is projecting that the
[51:49] characters in the Bible are
[51:51] representations of some characters today
[51:54] and if we can get inspired enough in his
[51:58] presence we'll be able to locate our own
[52:01] identity
[52:02] &gt;&gt; in the Bible. There's a character that
[52:04] fit us
[52:06] &gt;&gt; and it fit us perfectly. And what is
[52:09] good for me is that if we'll see the
[52:11] outcome of that character, in other
[52:14] words, if that character made it,
[52:16] &gt;&gt; then it will give us faith.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; That we will also make it.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; If that character went through
[52:22] challenges, Amen. and you are also going
[52:25] through challenges. If that character
[52:27] wasn't defeated, then you know you will
[52:30] never be defeated.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Because your shadow can never fail.
[52:34] Amen.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; I believe this was the inspiration
[52:39] that sister that brother said, "Let us
[52:41] call Auntie Jamaima."
[52:44] &gt;&gt; This was the grace she had.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Take note, Auntie Jamaima was not even a
[52:50] message believer
[52:52] &gt;&gt; at the time of the report.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the principles of the word is
[52:57] just the same and is going to work for
[53:00] anyone, believer or saint. Amen.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; This is why the prophet said sometimes a
[53:06] prostitute or an unbeliever would come
[53:08] in and receive his or healing when the
[53:12] children of the kingdom are struggling
[53:14] &gt;&gt; to get their blessings because the
[53:17] blessings of God walk by principles.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; So if we could come by his word tonight.
[53:23] Amen.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; I like it when it said when you see the
[53:26] outcome of that character, you already
[53:29] know what your outcome will be.
[53:31] That is a way to build faith in
[53:33] ourselves.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; So this auntie Jumima had a very serious
[53:38] condition. Her son was sick and uh the
[53:43] son was nearing death. He was going to
[53:46] die and he began to she began to pray
[53:49] for her son. Then you know the trouble
[53:53] the challenge got so much on her till
[53:56] she began to think on her ways and
[53:59] somehow the mercy of the Lord came down.
[54:02] While she was looking at the story of
[54:04] our life she find something that looks
[54:07] like her
[54:08] &gt;&gt; a story that matches with us
[54:11] &gt;&gt; right in the Bible.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Then she exclaimed I is that Shunamite
[54:16] woman. Amen.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; When that realization struck her,
[54:23] &gt;&gt; she didn't even have to pray.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Is it does it mean you don't believe in
[54:30] prayer? I believe in prayer. Prayer.
[54:32] Prayer. Prayer.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; But what I'm saying is that you have to
[54:36] pray with understanding.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Something must inspire your prayer. When
[54:42] that sister prayed through, God inspired
[54:45] her to locate her identity
[54:48] &gt;&gt; in the word of the Lord. And at that
[54:50] moment, by that location alone, her
[54:53] prayer was already answered.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; She said, "I shunite woman." Then all
[54:59] she needed to do is to look at how it
[55:02] worked out for her. Then she can tell
[55:05] what her own outcome will be, whether
[55:08] she pray or not.
[55:12] It's a powerful realization.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Then as she found her identity in the
[55:18] scriptures,
[55:19] then she said to herself, "Where is your
[55:22] Elijah?"
[55:24] &gt;&gt; It was a thought. It was an expression.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Where is your Elijah?
[55:30] &gt;&gt; And the Lord of Elijah,
[55:32] &gt;&gt; the Lord who knows where Elijah was,
[55:35] &gt;&gt; went and locate Elijah for her. Amen.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Elijah was in the plane traveling
[55:42] &gt;&gt; amongst many other travelers
[55:44] &gt;&gt; who had important businesses
[55:47] &gt;&gt; appointment to go and keep
[55:49] &gt;&gt; but the appointment did not matter again
[55:52] because a daughter of God located the
[55:55] identity
[55:56] &gt;&gt; in the word of the Lord.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; By that location she became the number
[56:00] one preference. Amen.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; May God help us to enjoy the blessings
[56:09] &gt;&gt; that God has freely given unto us.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; If you just know how to mind the wealth
[56:13] of the wedge,
[56:14] &gt;&gt; life will be victorious for you.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. There were a lot of people in that
[56:19] plane, but it didn't matter to God at
[56:21] that time because a daughter of God
[56:24] said, "Lord, if I am the Shunamite
[56:26] woman,
[56:27] &gt;&gt; then where is your Elijah?"
[56:29] Because the picture has got to become
[56:31] perfect.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; We have the Shunomite woman. We have the
[56:35] son that has been struck by disease.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was she was going to die. Then
[56:40] for the picture to become perfect, there
[56:42] must be an Elijah.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; And it doesn't matter whether it is
[56:50] season or out of season.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Because when the Shunami woman went to
[56:54] her husband, he says, "Saddle me and
[56:56] us." It will be today. get me a car and
[56:58] a driver.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Where are you going?" He
[57:01] said, "I'm going to see the prophet of
[57:03] the Lord." And the husband said, "It is
[57:05] neither the new moon nor the this and
[57:07] that." Hallelujah. In other words, it is
[57:10] not the season to go and see the
[57:11] prophet. But the woman said, "Whether it
[57:14] is in season or out of season, all will
[57:16] be well." Amen.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; And I tell you tonight, whether it is in
[57:21] season or out of season,
[57:23] &gt;&gt; God overrides every season.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Because he is the God of all season.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; It was out of the season for the prophet
[57:33] to turn around and come and attend to a
[57:36] sick call because she was actually in
[57:38] the air traveling somewhere among many
[57:42] other people. There might have been many
[57:44] CEOs and big people who were going to
[57:47] sign multi-million billion dollar deals,
[57:50] but it never mattered to God because of
[57:52] a woman who found her identity in the
[57:56] word of the Lord. And it wouldn't matter
[57:58] to God when your case is at stake. If
[58:01] you could find your identity,
[58:04] &gt;&gt; in the word of the Lord, search the
[58:06] scriptures.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; In them, you think you have eternal
[58:10] life. They are they that testify who I
[58:13] am.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; They testified of the bridegroom. They
[58:16] must testify of his bride.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Because the same scripture that applies
[58:20] to the groom applies to his bride.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; And the bride will be word of his word,
[58:26] power of his power, life of his life.
[58:29] She will be him.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Same characteristics.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; So God unplugged the knot on the
[58:39] aeroplane.
[58:40] And it signaled emergency
[58:43] &gt;&gt; and the pilot said we have to do a force
[58:45] landing
[58:46] &gt;&gt; and the only place they could land the
[58:49] only place they could land for you to
[58:51] know it was the guiding hand of the
[58:53] Almighty. The only place they could land
[58:55] was in Memphis, Tennessee.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Right in the town where the woman lives.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; That is not a coincidence. That is the
[59:04] power of God
[59:06] &gt;&gt; responding to the need of his own
[59:08] daughter. He is still the same God
[59:10] tonight. Whatever your needs are,
[59:13] &gt;&gt; this is another avenue for you to
[59:16] receive your blessings. Begin to get in
[59:18] the spirit. Begin to locate your
[59:21] identity
[59:22] &gt;&gt; in the scripture. If you are in a state
[59:24] of suffocation, if there's no place to
[59:27] move in the front, and there's no back
[59:29] to turn to, no side to pull over,
[59:32] remember it has happened like that in
[59:33] the Bible before. There was a time
[59:36] Israel following God's leadership find
[59:38] themselves before the Red Sea. Find the
[59:41] Egyptians behind them. The hills and
[59:43] valleys were here. But what was the
[59:45] outcome? If they were never consumed,
[59:48] you can never be consumed. No matter how
[59:51] your experiences are getting tough and
[59:53] suffocating, only believe all things are
[59:56] possible.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; If they were never consumed, you can
[1:00:00] never be consumed. That is the way to
[1:00:03] have faith in the promises of God. Begin
[1:00:06] to locate your situation. Begin to
[1:00:08] locate your person in the word of the
[1:00:10] Lord tonight. And it will give you a new
[1:00:13] faith. It will awaken the giants of the
[1:00:17] faith in you to look positive in the
[1:00:20] face of any situation and mock the
[1:00:23] devil.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Mock your fears tonight.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; You love him.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Friends,
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; the plane did force landing
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; right in Memphis, Tennessee. Yes.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; And the prophet asked the people, the
[1:00:41] technicians, the pilot and so forth, how
[1:00:44] long will it take to fix this plane? I
[1:00:46] think they said about four hours. He
[1:00:48] said that is enough time for me to do
[1:00:50] some postages.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; So he thought it was letter posting that
[1:00:55] God put him down for. But God had a
[1:00:58] different appointment.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; So when he carried his pouch or his bag
[1:01:02] to go and post letter, the spirit said
[1:01:05] keep moving. Amen.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; That's where you got the song, keep
[1:01:08] moving.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; The spirit told brother Abraham. That
[1:01:11] was where the song came from. He said,
[1:01:13] "Keep moving."
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't bring you here to post
[1:01:17] letters. I brought you here as an answer
[1:01:20] to the yearning of my daughter who found
[1:01:23] identity
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; or did they look do you know our
[1:01:26] situation identity in the word of the
[1:01:28] Lord?
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; And you know what? Before the day broke
[1:01:33] that day, God had also told the woman
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; that Elijah you ask for is on the way.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Because he works on both hands.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; This is why you must never take the
[1:01:47] matter upon yourself.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Let go and let God.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; He knows how to fix it. He knows how to
[1:01:53] arrange it.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Christianity is peace.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Christianity is rest. Rest little bride
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; because all is well.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; The strength of Israel can never lie.
[1:02:05] Nothing can get out of his hand. He came
[1:02:08] four days late in Lazarus matter and yet
[1:02:11] he wasn't late.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; What was the outcome?
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; So as he was going with the pouch and
[1:02:23] start moving, brother Bram said, "Not
[1:02:25] knowing where I was going.
[1:02:28] It was just following the spirit. The
[1:02:30] Lord went back to tell that lady, "Come,
[1:02:32] the Elijah you asked for is on the way."
[1:02:35] And because over the night in the dream,
[1:02:37] she had seen how she was going to be
[1:02:39] dressed for you to know it wasn't a
[1:02:41] coincidence
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; that Brother had to touch down in
[1:02:45] Memphis.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; It was all the working of God.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; That woman who was never a message
[1:02:51] believer
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; saw Elijah. So how can you live today
[1:02:56] and deny the prophet as Elijah? What
[1:02:59] would you tell the woman of Memphis
[1:03:02] when she asked for Elijah and God sent
[1:03:05] her William and you are still in doubt
[1:03:07] who the Elijah of this hour is.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Come on. It's a sin to disbelieve.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; It's a sin.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; It's a sin.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; And it started going. It started going.
[1:03:23] The woman was so sure of her revelation.
[1:03:26] You know what she did? She came out.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; She stood by her gate.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; If any neighbor ask her what were you
[1:03:32] doing? Say I'm waiting for Elijah.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Which Elijah?
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Elijah of this hour I ask for Elijah.
[1:03:40] And the neighbor is going to say you
[1:03:42] must be out of your mind.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; And brethren, it takes to be out of our
[1:03:46] mind before we can believe God. Amen.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; If you are not ready to lose your mind,
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; you won't take the mind that was in
[1:03:53] Christ Jesus.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Be out of your mind tonight.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown said, "If you want to
[1:03:59] believe the open word, you've got no
[1:04:01] thought coming."
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Because things will come better than
[1:04:08] your personal understanding.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; The Bible must become a new book in your
[1:04:13] hand.
[1:04:14] That sister stood outside waiting for
[1:04:16] Elijah
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; and Elijah appeared.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; And when she looked, okay, yeah, that's
[1:04:24] the bag I saw. That's exactly the color
[1:04:26] of the suit he was wearing. That's the
[1:04:28] tie. That's the shirt. Okay. He's even
[1:04:30] having the heart. Okay. It must be the
[1:04:33] one.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; All right. And Elijah had no idea where
[1:04:37] he was going.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the goodness of God? That
[1:04:42] woman had better revelation than the
[1:04:44] prophet for that moment.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; She knew what was to happen.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Elijah never knew what was to happen.
[1:04:51] But Elijah, it is enough that Elijah was
[1:04:54] in the will of God
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; just doing what the Lord says.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; And as Elijah was passing by, the woman
[1:05:00] said, "Good morning person."
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; And good morning person. Brother Abraham
[1:05:06] turned back. He said, "When I looked at
[1:05:08] her, she was old enough for me to call
[1:05:09] her auntie.
[1:05:12] And she and he said, "Good morning,
[1:05:14] auntie. How did you know him?" Auntie
[1:05:17] said, "In fact, this is where you should
[1:05:19] you were coming."
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Really? And she gave her testimony. And
[1:05:24] brother Arab said, "I still don't
[1:05:26] understand." But her testimony was so
[1:05:28] real, I couldn't turn her down. Then he
[1:05:32] went with her. And when they came
[1:05:34] inside, he said, "You see, I am that
[1:05:37] woman."
[1:05:39] Amen.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; She introduced herself again as a
[1:05:42] shamite woman. What a conviction that
[1:05:45] was.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; He said, "I never had a child. I trusted
[1:05:51] God for one, he gave me." And Yeshuna
[1:05:53] might never had a child. She trusted God
[1:05:56] and God gave.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "As my son grow up,
[1:06:00] uh he he got instructed. I tried to
[1:06:04] raise her up in a nice way, in a godly
[1:06:06] way, but he took the wrong road and it
[1:06:09] caught social disease and he's going to
[1:06:11] die. Now the Shunamite woman, brother
[1:06:14] Abraham said, maybe God's son stroke
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; or something like that and he died. And
[1:06:20] the sister said and the auntie said, you
[1:06:22] know what? uh if God is going to take
[1:06:26] him that's okay but I want him to
[1:06:29] confess Christ
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; before he is taken
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; that struck me very deep
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; that even in the hour of the deepest
[1:06:39] desperation
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; the woman what she wanted was the
[1:06:43] kingdom of God first
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; in other word if he's going to survive
[1:06:50] this he must be ready to live for God
[1:06:53] Amen.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. But Lord, if you are pleased to
[1:06:56] take him, it is fine. But let me have
[1:06:59] the testimony
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; that he confessed you because that will
[1:07:03] be the only guarantee that I was I will
[1:07:06] see mama's boy again.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Brother said even in his condition, he
[1:07:11] still addressed him as mama's boy.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; What a love.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; And that looks to me like the love of
[1:07:20] God himself. Amen.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; The love of God is unconditional.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; He said while we were yet sinners.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; He commended his love towards us.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; You never did anything to impress him
[1:07:33] before he loved you.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; His love was in election.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; When when when he elected you in his
[1:07:41] heart to be one of his own, he placed a
[1:07:43] gym a gin
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; or a gem, a soul of life in there.
[1:07:49] Are you with me, brethren?
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; You were not born empty.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; You were born with a seed gene.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It is not everybody that
[1:07:59] carries that.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; And it is that gene of God that makes
[1:08:02] you a son,
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; a daughter of God, not even your new
[1:08:07] birth.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Ah,
[1:08:10] now you go quiet on me.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:08:14] I didn't It wasn't a slip of tongue. I
[1:08:17] meant what I said.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; It is not a new birth that makes you a
[1:08:22] son
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; or a daughter of God.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; The new birth brings you to the
[1:08:26] realization
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; of your sunship and your daughtership.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; What makes you a son or a daughter of
[1:08:34] God is election.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; That is the meaning of the love of God.
[1:08:40] Amen.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Before the foundation of the world,
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; he ordained you to life
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; and he puts the seed of life. Remember,
[1:08:49] it was before you received the Holy
[1:08:51] Ghost that you started thinking about
[1:08:54] Christ. You started thinking about a
[1:08:56] change. Brother Brown said it is the
[1:08:58] deposit of God in you
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; that was hungering and testing.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. for life at that time and it
[1:09:06] staggered you to the church or it made
[1:09:08] you listen to the gospel one more time
[1:09:11] and it struck a hold.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; What strikes a hold was the quickening
[1:09:15] of the seed.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; So what the spirit does is to wake up,
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; is to sprank to like
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; what was already in you.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Brother said that was actually to be
[1:09:31] you. But because we were born natural,
[1:09:35] you understand the way we were born.
[1:09:37] That birth was a program between Satan
[1:09:39] and Eve
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; and it was the devil's way of injecting
[1:09:44] his own nature into mankind. So as many
[1:09:47] as were born that way have a nature of
[1:09:50] the devil imposed. That is why the pro
[1:09:53] Bible said we were by nature the
[1:09:55] children of rot fitted only for
[1:09:58] destruction. But that nature that I'm
[1:10:00] sorry is it okay?
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Sometimes I like to
[1:10:05] connect with my audience.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. That nature that fits you for
[1:10:09] destruction. Amen. It didn't come from
[1:10:13] God. It wasn't your real you.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; The real you is the one that lays
[1:10:18] dormant like a little button armless
[1:10:22] inside of you. Amen. But because your
[1:10:25] first manifestation on earth was flesh
[1:10:27] and blood, that is the nature that
[1:10:29] became activated and it started
[1:10:32] controlling you. Satan stole your
[1:10:34] identity
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; to do many things. Amen. They saw you
[1:10:39] here. They thought it was you stealing.
[1:10:41] It wasn't you.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; They thought it was you uh living
[1:10:45] immoral. It wasn't you. They thought it
[1:10:47] was you fighting. It wasn't you. It was
[1:10:51] an identity theft by the devil. Lord,
[1:10:54] your real you cannot fight. Lord, ye you
[1:10:58] cannot steal.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Your real you cannot even commit sin. It
[1:11:03] doesn't have it in him to do. This is
[1:11:06] why the Bible say it that is born of God
[1:11:09] does not commit sin because the seed of
[1:11:12] God abideth in him. Why is he not a
[1:11:16] sinner? because it doesn't have a desire
[1:11:19] for it.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; That is what makes the difference.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; But your first appearance didn't look
[1:11:27] like that.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Born in sin shaped in iniquity come to
[1:11:31] the world speaking lies.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you keep on doing like that
[1:11:36] until you appointed season.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; When your season came, you at the same
[1:11:41] word you've been hearing. It came
[1:11:43] strangely this time around because your
[1:11:45] real you
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; is ready to come to life.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; And that and your real you and that old
[1:11:52] nature don't dwell together.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; One must give way for the other.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; This is why when God comes with the
[1:12:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost to give a
[1:12:02] quickening to your real you, he also
[1:12:04] comes with fire
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; to do what? to burn the nature
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; to his roots and an elate it completely.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Arab said the way is redeeming
[1:12:16] you is the way is redeeming the earth
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; that you are going to live in. That is
[1:12:22] why before the first quaset is set in
[1:12:24] here and eternity begins, there must be
[1:12:27] another annihilation by firemen,
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; a cleansing of fire to renovate the
[1:12:33] earth. As your heart is being renovated
[1:12:36] for God to take full occupation.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; You love him tonight.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's come back to auntie
[1:12:47] Jamaima's house
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; because if we go that way we won't leave
[1:12:51] here tonight
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; except you are prepared for a night all
[1:12:55] night.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you saints.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; So it's a I just need that testimony
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; that he meets God before he dies. And uh
[1:13:07] when a when a person thinks like that, I
[1:13:10] think it's always like God to give them
[1:13:13] bonus
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; because you know why she was seeking the
[1:13:18] kingdom of God
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; even first in the face of death.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; And there's a principle seek ye first
[1:13:26] the kingdom of God
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; and its righteousness then all other
[1:13:31] things.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. those other things whether
[1:13:34] you pray for them or you do not pray for
[1:13:37] them it's a given
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; as long as you seek the kingdom that is
[1:13:41] the principle you seek the kingdom then
[1:13:44] all other things you know why every
[1:13:46] other thing it's in the kingdom
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; brother said when you receive the Holy
[1:13:52] Ghost all that you need and all that you
[1:13:56] will ever need even to your rapture it's
[1:13:59] already in you
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; come on charge
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; everything you need,
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; every blessing as you water that seed of
[1:14:08] God.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Growing it start manifesting
[1:14:12] pushing out your blessings.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. At the appointed time, it pushes
[1:14:17] out your wife,
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; pushes out your husband, pushes out your
[1:14:21] children, it pushes out your jobs, it
[1:14:24] pushes out your house, it pushes out
[1:14:26] every blessing.
[1:14:29] That is why God said take no thought
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; if our faith can rise to it. Jesus said
[1:14:35] do not be anxious for nothing
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; because all things are already yours but
[1:14:43] the kingdom of God in your heart.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; This is the rest of the believers.
[1:14:54] Because she sought for the kingdom,
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; God was ready to offer her bonuses.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Let's say the bonus by a woman who
[1:15:02] located identity
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; in the word of the Lord.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Abraham said,
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; I was still trying to come to terms with
[1:15:11] what she was saying. Then I said, you
[1:15:14] know what, auntie, you pray.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:19] You know when they all entered that boy
[1:15:22] was saying it's getting dark in here.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Meaning the shadows of death
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; were already covering.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; And brother Abraham said auntie began to
[1:15:34] pray and you can tell that auntie is
[1:15:37] used
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; to talking to God.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Mamas
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; be used to talking to God.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; You need it very well. Amen.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "A praying mother can
[1:15:49] do much more in the life of a child even
[1:15:53] than a pastor
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; behind the pulpit."
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; God makes you the kinsman redeemer.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; I'm using the words of the prophet. You
[1:16:01] are the nearest king to those children.
[1:16:05] This is why your prayer done righteously
[1:16:08] must avail
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; in their lives. You are one of those who
[1:16:12] must wave the token over your family.
[1:16:15] We've got four things to wave the token
[1:16:17] over our children. Then we can say,
[1:16:19] "Lord, it is in your hand."
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "Live a life worthy
[1:16:23] before them."
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "Keep the right
[1:16:26] atmosphere in the home. Put out things
[1:16:28] that are evil out of your house." He
[1:16:31] said, "Then brother said find time to
[1:16:33] sit with them and share the word." Then
[1:16:36] number four, he said, "Learn to be on
[1:16:38] your knees. Pray for those children." If
[1:16:41] you have done those four things, he
[1:16:43] said, "Leave the rest." Amen.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; into the hands of the Lord
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; day by day. Tell them no matter how they
[1:16:49] are behaving,
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; if they are behaving contrary
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; to the values of the word, tell it to
[1:16:55] yourself. It is mere symptoms.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet call it. He said
[1:17:00] don't look at symptoms. Look at the
[1:17:03] promise.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; If it get worse with her or with him,
[1:17:06] look at the promise and tell the child I
[1:17:09] have claimed you for Christ.
[1:17:11] You have no option at God's appointed
[1:17:14] time. Hallelujah. You must come to his
[1:17:17] saving grace. It's the principle of the
[1:17:19] word. Brother said, "I've seen it so
[1:17:22] effective that even when some mamas have
[1:17:25] gone on to the Lord." God put their
[1:17:28] prayers in a bank waiting for the
[1:17:32] appointed time to reckon with it. That
[1:17:34] was why he could tell some folks when
[1:17:36] they come to the altar. He said, "Do you
[1:17:38] know what is happening today? It is the
[1:17:41] prayer of your mother that has long gone
[1:17:44] that God has brought to remembrance and
[1:17:46] that is what has brought you to the
[1:17:47] altar. You've got the power my sister
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; let us enjoy the blessings that God have
[1:17:54] put in our hand.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Brother the prophet said auntie pray
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; and auntie prayed like she's used to
[1:18:00] talking to God
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; and you know all the prophet did was to
[1:18:03] endorse our prayer.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; That's all he did. He endorsed the
[1:18:08] prayer of that woman and the boy who
[1:18:10] said it's getting dark in here started
[1:18:13] saying it's getting light in here.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; It's getting light in here. It's getting
[1:18:17] light in here. In the midst of the
[1:18:19] revival and joy, brother Arab left to
[1:18:21] run to the airport. And when he got to
[1:18:24] the airport, he was being called for the
[1:18:26] last time.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; William Brown, final call for your body
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; because the mission has been
[1:18:34] accomplished.
[1:18:38] Two years later,
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; he met the same young man in one of the
[1:18:43] ports, airports or so, and they couldn't
[1:18:46] recognize him again.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; And the boy walked up to the prophet and
[1:18:50] said, "You couldn't you can't recognize
[1:18:52] me, Brother Abraham." He said, "No, I
[1:18:54] doubt. I'm sorry. We made a lot of
[1:18:56] people, you know." He said, "Yes, I am
[1:18:58] that Auntie Juba's son,
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; whom you came to play for
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; two years ago." He says, "Since that
[1:19:07] time, I've been healed and I've cleaned
[1:19:09] up my life. I've settled down and
[1:19:12] married with a child and I'm serving the
[1:19:14] Lord, preaching the gospel."
[1:19:18] [Applause]
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; So, the mama got a bonus
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; for placing the kingdom of God first.
[1:19:25] That is the power of those who located
[1:19:28] their identity
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; in the word of the Lord.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; You love him tonight.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; One time in Bram tabernacle.
[1:19:40] The old man would know more about this
[1:19:41] than I do.
[1:19:44] They are reservoirs of histories of the
[1:19:46] message. But this one I read so I'm
[1:19:50] fine.
[1:19:52] One time you know they were
[1:19:54] contemplating I think a renovation or an
[1:19:57] expansion of the church and uh they were
[1:20:01] taking the pledges from people you know
[1:20:03] voluntary pledges whoever wants to be a
[1:20:06] support and there was an old widow woman
[1:20:10] very popular among us sister
[1:20:15] ate right and uh from the account of the
[1:20:19] prophet Ahan Hennings was $100
[1:20:22] Then,
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; yeah, $100 digging potatoes as laborers
[1:20:27] for farm people, for farm owners. And
[1:20:30] this woman came and pledged $50,
[1:20:35] half of our annual wages. She's a widow.
[1:20:39] She's so poor even by the poverty or
[1:20:43] standard of living index at that time.
[1:20:46] But she was so committed to the things
[1:20:48] of God. I think our life is an
[1:20:50] inspiration
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; for those of us who might think that it
[1:20:54] is when we have money that we'll do
[1:20:56] things for the Lord. You see, if you
[1:20:58] don't do it when you don't have,
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; you cannot do it when you have.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Because resources isn't what makes you
[1:21:07] committed.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Commitment comes from the heart.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; It's a victory in itself. That is why
[1:21:13] you see somebody with $10 for the
[1:21:16] kingdom, you will still want to pinch
[1:21:18] out of it. Whereas somebody with
[1:21:20] $10,000, you say, "Let me have $100,000
[1:21:23] before I serve the Lord."
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; I hope I'm not uing your feelings.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Or I'm just preaching the gospel.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; But this woman, $100 a whole year and
[1:21:36] she pledged 50. And as a commitment to
[1:21:40] demonstrate her seriousness, she has
[1:21:42] redeemed 20
[1:21:44] $20.
[1:21:46] So the boards, the dickens and the the
[1:21:49] board were you know telling the prophet
[1:21:52] when giving report when it came around
[1:21:54] they were giving it excitingly and the
[1:21:57] prophet was shocked in his heart. If we
[1:22:00] need people's money it's not that kind
[1:22:02] of our own money. She's a poor woman.
[1:22:06] So, brother Abraham made up his mind to
[1:22:09] return Sister Attorney in a very stylish
[1:22:13] way.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; The wife gave him $20 to buy an to buy
[1:22:20] some eggs and so forth. He said, "I
[1:22:22] better go to Hat's house to go and drop
[1:22:24] this money." And you watch this.
[1:22:29] When he was going, the Lord began to
[1:22:31] deal with him.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; And the Lord just gave him a scripture.
[1:22:36] You know what in the Bible there was a
[1:22:39] widow woman
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; who gave let me use the word maybe cent
[1:22:44] today who gave two cents or $2.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; And uh there were a lot of people who
[1:22:52] gave so much in that meeting
[1:22:56] but I the Lord said she gave the most
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; because those who gave thousands gave
[1:23:03] out of their plenties.
[1:23:05] But she gave out of nothing.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; So God was using the law of relativity,
[1:23:11] not absolute
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; figures. In other word, she gave 100% of
[1:23:18] a 100%.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Whereas a $10,000 of somebody might just
[1:23:23] be 1% of several. You get it? So if we
[1:23:27] look at it in percentages, the woman
[1:23:29] gave the highest.
[1:23:32] And he was telling the prophet, "Perhaps
[1:23:34] if you were there that day, you would
[1:23:36] have stopped her."
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "But I didn't stop her then,
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; and neither should she be stopped." Now,
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; what was God showing?
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; He was showing that that widow woman
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; was a shadow identity
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; of sister, right?
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; My goodness.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Are you following? Amen.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; So the rest of the story about the widow
[1:24:04] woman that we couldn't see in the
[1:24:05] shadow, we can find out in our own life.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Because our story never ended with that
[1:24:12] pledge money.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Brother said it was because God knew
[1:24:17] what he had for her
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; along the road. That was why he inspired
[1:24:23] her
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; to do such a thing. Amen.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Then the prophet became very humble
[1:24:31] and uh said, "Well, I'm on my road
[1:24:33] anyhow, but we'll forget about this $20
[1:24:36] business."
[1:24:39] I thought we don't need it, but God said
[1:24:41] he needs it.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; So, let the Lord have it. Amen.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; And by the time she he got to the house
[1:24:48] of the sister, he met some brothers
[1:24:50] there. Now we call this woman I've
[1:24:53] always wondered we called her a very
[1:24:55] poor woman but her house is always
[1:24:57] filled with brethren.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Most account of what you will read about
[1:25:03] sister aie her father uh mother it's all
[1:25:07] about them entertaining the brethren.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; So why would a poor why would people be
[1:25:15] so much attracted to the house of a poor
[1:25:17] sister?
[1:25:20] What does she offer? What did she offer
[1:25:21] them
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; that would have been sweeter, better,
[1:25:24] nicer, sumptuous
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; than what they could have gotten
[1:25:28] elsewhere?
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; I think it is the atmosphere that she
[1:25:31] created around herself. And I think it
[1:25:34] is the love with which
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; she presented her peanuts.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; She might not have more than peanuts,
[1:25:41] but the love with which she presented it
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; endeared her to the people. Hallelujah.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; So the prophet got there and settled
[1:25:50] down with the brethren and one thing led
[1:25:53] to the other discussions were going on
[1:25:55] and as they started talking about the
[1:25:58] testimony of the spoken word.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; And uh this sister also got interested
[1:26:05] but you know what she did she started
[1:26:08] playing Mary and matter combined.
[1:26:13] I think we can learn from her. You said,
[1:26:15] "What do you mean?" The prophet told us
[1:26:18] that she positioned herself, I think, by
[1:26:20] the door of the kitchen because she was
[1:26:22] trying to cook something for her guests,
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; but at the same time, she was interested
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; in the testimony.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; So with her hands, she was working in
[1:26:32] the kitchen, but with her heart, she was
[1:26:34] connecting with the word.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Matter was so busy with kitchen things
[1:26:39] to the detriment of the word. Mary will
[1:26:42] sit to listen to the word money tonight
[1:26:45] to the detriment of the house.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; So we need a combination.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. The house must be kept in it.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; And yet we must hear the gospel.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; We must spare time to pray.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; We must spare time to listen to the
[1:27:02] word.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. So while she was there sitting in
[1:27:06] the middle, Amen. The prophet was
[1:27:09] laboring
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; to convince the brothers that were
[1:27:12] seated with him at the table. He was
[1:27:14] saying, "You know what? That thing
[1:27:16] wasn't a myth. It wasn't a vision. I
[1:27:20] killed the squirrel. It bled. We cooked
[1:27:23] it. We ate it."
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; And yet they were still looking.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Some of you come to the house of the
[1:27:33] Lord with skeptic ideas.
[1:27:37] And some of you get so full of
[1:27:39] yourselves
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; until even the spirit cannot break you.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; The only thing that breaks you is dozing
[1:27:46] in church
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; is sleeping in church.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that breaks.
[1:27:53] Outside of that, people don't know who
[1:27:56] you are moody with.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; You say it's my nature. It's a bad
[1:27:59] nature for a Christian to have.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. When the spirit of the Lord take
[1:28:05] over your life, it changes your nature.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; So, let us go with a song and a smile.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; The world is exuberance in the things of
[1:28:14] the world.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; They go to their games. You don't tell
[1:28:17] them to say, "Man, you don't tell them
[1:28:19] to rejoice there." They don't sit there
[1:28:21] moody.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; They get connected in order to enjoy
[1:28:25] their game.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That is the emotional drive.
[1:28:29] Here is where we come to express our own
[1:28:32] emotions and we must be exorbitant in
[1:28:35] the presence of God.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Don't let your grace pass you by
[1:28:41] friends.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Respond to the word.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; The spirit of the Lord was moving. One
[1:28:49] day the pillar of air was moving and it
[1:28:51] was descending from seat to seat. That
[1:28:53] was how a brother sat looking at the
[1:28:55] prophet when his life was being talked
[1:28:57] about. He was so lost. He was just
[1:29:00] looking. Then the pillar of fire thought
[1:29:02] that he wasn't ready. He just moved to
[1:29:04] the next person. That was when he woke
[1:29:05] up. Brother Abraham said, "Mr. This, you
[1:29:08] missed it."
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; And he missed it completely because the
[1:29:13] pillar of never came back to him.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. Amen.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; This was why those brothers in their
[1:29:26] watch it took a woman who wasn't seated
[1:29:29] close to the prophet
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; to give comfort the prophet needed.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; It said brother Abraham that is nothing
[1:29:36] but the truth
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; and the Lord honored it.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; The moment she said that everywhere
[1:29:44] change
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; and brother Brown says sister ate you
[1:29:48] have found favor before the Lord. Ask
[1:29:51] anything you want.
[1:29:53] Amen.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; God is still in that business of giving
[1:29:56] blanket checks.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Brother said we live in the times that
[1:30:00] God will put it amongst human being
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; to ask and it shall be given.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; It said so. It didn't tell us those
[1:30:08] times are taken off.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Your right mental attitude.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; That was why he said your right mental
[1:30:13] attitude to every promise of God to the
[1:30:16] word of God will determine your
[1:30:19] blessings. Amen.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; You can leave here tonight packing
[1:30:22] bonuses of blessings.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; And while another person may leave and
[1:30:25] say, "I feel no virtue."
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; He felt no virtue because he wasn't
[1:30:29] connected.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; How did it take a woman sitting at the
[1:30:36] kitchen door
[1:30:38] to give the right comfort? Whereas those
[1:30:41] who were sitting by the prophet at the
[1:30:43] table were looking.
[1:30:45] [Music]
[1:30:48] Glory to God.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; And said, "I don't know what to ask."
[1:30:54] You know what the prophet said in
[1:30:56] another place? He said, "God knows the
[1:30:58] characters he gives blanket check to."
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; So Arty has gotten to that realm of
[1:31:04] maturity. She's coming to a climax to
[1:31:07] know what to do with the blessings of
[1:31:08] God
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; right here on earth.
[1:31:13] And you all know the rest of the story
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; because somebody located our identity.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Don't forget that somebody saw our
[1:31:24] identity in the word of the Lord.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Mind who you identify with.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; We can go on and on. We have we have we
[1:31:36] have finished on identifying yourself in
[1:31:38] the Bible.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Now mind who you identify with.
[1:31:45] Because who you identify with
[1:31:50] do not sometimes only determine your
[1:31:52] fortune.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; It cannot affect the fortunes of your
[1:31:56] generation.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; And I have that by the scripture.
[1:32:05] Don't move with people who have negative
[1:32:08] energies.
[1:32:12] The congregations of I cannot, I cannot,
[1:32:15] I cannot.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; We be not able.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; If you are within the circles of friends
[1:32:24] that when you finish conversation, they
[1:32:26] leaves you vile.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Then you get to them. You must change
[1:32:31] your company.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Mind who you identify with.
[1:32:39] You must move with characters that
[1:32:41] provoke you
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; to good works.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Iron must sharpen iron.
[1:32:56] He was a righteous man.
[1:32:59] Hear me. Hear me. Good.
[1:33:02] Joseph was such a righteous man.
[1:33:09] But he lost all
[1:33:12] because of poor discret discretion of
[1:33:15] who to move with.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Even when God had mercy upon him to
[1:33:21] escape
[1:33:24] certain fatalities,
[1:33:26] as a repercussion for his indiscretion.
[1:33:29] His generation didn't
[1:33:34] time will fail me to trace it because
[1:33:36] we'll go through about seven chapters to
[1:33:39] do that. But let me give you a summary.
[1:33:44] The prophet said Aab and Jehoshaphat
[1:33:48] and were not exactly the same.
[1:33:55] Jehoshaphat was a worshshiper of God who
[1:33:58] was committed.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Because sometimes you ask yourself, why
[1:34:01] do bad things happen to good people?
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; This can be why.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; This is one of the wise. Not all of the
[1:34:10] wise, but this is one.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; There could be positive reasons also,
[1:34:16] but this is a negative one which I want
[1:34:18] you to learn from.
[1:34:23] The Bible's description of Aab was that
[1:34:26] there was not a man so wicked who sold
[1:34:29] his art to do evil like Aab.
[1:34:33] How many ever read that in the Bible?
[1:34:35] That was the Bible's description of this
[1:34:36] character
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; because he joined himself into idol
[1:34:43] worship
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; by a poor marriage. That's right.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; And it was by him the prophet taught us
[1:34:51] that we shouldn't marry unbelievers.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Always marry believers.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Mixed marriages have never worked.
[1:35:01] That's one of the mixed marriages the
[1:35:02] prophet talked about.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; He said it never worked. When Solomon
[1:35:06] joined himself to strange women,
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; the wisest king on the earth died and
[1:35:12] had a worshshiper.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; That's the scripture.
[1:35:18] And it was this action of ease that made
[1:35:21] the kingdom of Israel that was united as
[1:35:23] one to be divided into two.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Read your Bible.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; And the reason God had to divide it was
[1:35:33] because God wanted to spite and
[1:35:36] humiliate Solomon
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; for what he did by handling over the
[1:35:41] kingdom of Solomon to his own errand
[1:35:43] boy.
[1:35:46] But Jerobam wasn't of the seed of David
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; who had an inheritance of perpetuity of
[1:35:53] kingdom.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; So for the sake of David, God had to
[1:35:57] divide the kingdom so that he can retain
[1:36:00] his promise to David of giving him a
[1:36:03] perpetual kingdom.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; But the major part of Israel was handed
[1:36:08] over to Eron boy of Solomon.
[1:36:14] because of this.
[1:36:18] And the Bible said when Jeroboam came,
[1:36:22] that guy was too evil
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; until his evil became a stain that
[1:36:28] couldn't be bleached out of Israel.
[1:36:31] Every king that came, no matter most of
[1:36:34] them, no matter how great a revival they
[1:36:36] had, you will hear the Bible say, "But
[1:36:38] he did not depart
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; from the sin of Jeroboam, the son of
[1:36:43] Nebat, who caused Israel to sin." His
[1:36:47] sin was too much.
[1:36:50] But as if that was a light thing, Ahab
[1:36:53] added dimensions.
[1:36:56] That was who we was. I'm giving you a
[1:36:58] background.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Now for a righteous man, king of Judah,
[1:37:02] Jehoshaphat to come and join an affinity
[1:37:05] with such a character.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. You yourself, you are rejecting
[1:37:14] it in your heart.
[1:37:16] But that was it. That was what happened.
[1:37:19] The Bible said Jehoshaphat visited Ahab.
[1:37:24] And the Hab knowing himself to be a
[1:37:27] troublesome man
[1:37:30] who has gotten an acclaim as a
[1:37:32] troublemaker
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; is looking for a way to legitimize his
[1:37:36] actions.
[1:37:40] When those weward brothers are dragging
[1:37:42] you, conscripting you into their
[1:37:44] projects, they are only looking for
[1:37:46] legitimacy
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; for their poor lives.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; And it takes somebody standing pure and
[1:37:52] righteous
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; to stand as the cover.
[1:37:57] Aab remained unrepentant. He wasn't
[1:37:59] willing to change.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Brother said he always has an axe to
[1:38:03] grind with everybody. It doesn't feel
[1:38:06] good when everything is peaceful.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; He must simulate and create problem
[1:38:11] situations.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; I'm describing his character by the
[1:38:16] prophet.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; So when Joseph maybe by invitation or
[1:38:22] whatever came to meet him, the prophet
[1:38:25] said, "Watch what he did first."
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; He first approached him with an
[1:38:31] hospitality
[1:38:32] that was so generous.
[1:38:37] He killed him with kindness.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Not because Jehoshaphat himself wasn't a
[1:38:43] rich man.
[1:38:46] But you see, when you want to be polite
[1:38:47] when somebody went all the way out for
[1:38:50] you, you want to be polite to turn, you
[1:38:53] know, to appreciate them.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; But be careful the kind of appreciation
[1:38:56] you offer. Amen.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; And be careful the kind of gift you
[1:39:02] accept
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; because the cost of repayment may be too
[1:39:06] great for you.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Aab never disclosed his mission.
[1:39:11] He only offered hospitality. You see
[1:39:14] when you study the Bible and the Bible
[1:39:16] is giving you details of some things.
[1:39:18] It's because that thing is profound.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; He wants you to give attention.
[1:39:22] He said Ahab slaughtered a lot of cles
[1:39:25] this that and the other just for one man
[1:39:28] and his entourage. He was using all
[1:39:31] those things to arise his psychology
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; and to get him to submission for the
[1:39:36] plot that is coming
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; and that is why it's he wants he want
[1:39:43] young sisters he said that slick guy
[1:39:46] that could dump the can of his mama's
[1:39:49] vaseline mama's you know jelly on his
[1:39:51] head and look so great
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; if he started spoiling you with some
[1:39:55] kindness
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; with some generous gift he said he's
[1:39:59] putting you up
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; for a showdown.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Are you getting it?
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Because he's come to ask for a he's come
[1:40:07] he's come to ask for a repayment of that
[1:40:10] favor and the cost may be too great.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Don't be carried away.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Why is he buying you an iPhone?
[1:40:27] Why is he placing you on contract and he
[1:40:29] said don't let mama knows
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; I just feel led
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; that is not apostolic brethren if you
[1:40:38] want to be kind to the if you are itchy
[1:40:40] if you have enough to spend don't direct
[1:40:43] it to an innocent girl
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; bring your blessings to the deacons they
[1:40:49] know who have need
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; that is Why? That was how deacon deacons
[1:40:54] began in the Bible. Amen.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; So that the blessings can even out.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Don't single out a young sister in that
[1:41:04] innocent mind and become a predator in
[1:41:07] our life.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Am I making the seat hard for you?
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Truth must be preached anyhow.
[1:41:21] Hallelujah.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; And you young ladies to don't be weward
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; to be accepting gifts
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; from people.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Even if somebody's in cship with you.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; The best place I know where the prophet
[1:41:38] plays gifting is when he's engaged to
[1:41:40] you.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; He said when he's engaged to you, start
[1:41:43] giving you love tokens
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; beginning with an engagement ring. If he
[1:41:49] wants to buy car, buy house for you, he
[1:41:51] can do it. He's already locked inside
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; because your vow seals the deal
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; don't get carried away. Gift corrupt,
[1:42:00] gift blind.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; If you are taking decision, take it out
[1:42:05] of your pure heart.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Huh? Not because this, not because that,
[1:42:11] these things weaken the body.
[1:42:17] God bless you, sir.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; After I hear about offered hall, that
[1:42:22] was when he brought out his joker. Ramad
[1:42:25] Gillad belonged to us.
[1:42:28] He had it in mind all along.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; But he wanted to put Jehoshaphat in a
[1:42:32] condition where he cannot refuse.
[1:42:40] And they said Joshua said, "Okay.
[1:42:43] But that's fine if you want us to go to
[1:42:45] battle. Your people are as mine.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Mine is yours. Our God is the same.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; When you hear the prophet preach on that
[1:42:54] scream said, "No, they are not the
[1:42:56] same."
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Jehoshaphat is a worshshiper of God.
[1:43:02] Ahab is a worshshiper of Ba. How can
[1:43:04] they be the same?
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; We are not the same.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; But you see when you have been corrupted
[1:43:13] with hospitality,
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; you can you lose your senses.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; That was what happened.
[1:43:23] But the God factor in Jehoshaphat made
[1:43:26] him to make a small request.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; He said, "Even though this battle looks
[1:43:30] nice for us to go, can we please ask the
[1:43:33] Lord?"
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Aab said, "I got that covered. I
[1:43:37] know you are too righteous to go to
[1:43:39] anywhere without asking the Lord. I've
[1:43:41] got it covered. He called his 400
[1:43:43] prophet. They said, "Go."
[1:43:48] The divine instinct, the measure of
[1:43:50] discernment
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; that God placed in every child of God to
[1:43:55] guide them against error came up again
[1:43:58] in Jehoshaphat.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; He said, he said, "Isn't there a prophet
[1:44:02] of the Lord?"
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Can you underline that statement?
[1:44:06] meaning that these ones are your own
[1:44:08] prophet.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; I want to hear from the prophet of the
[1:44:11] Lord.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Oh man.
[1:44:14] [Applause]
[1:44:14] [Music]
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; And also answered he said he said that's
[1:44:20] where the problem is.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; We have one actually but I hate him.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; He loves his own prophet but he hates
[1:44:28] the prophet of the Lord.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Shouldn't you run from such a man?
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; What affinity should you have with such
[1:44:35] a person?
[1:44:36] What identification should we have with
[1:44:38] a character like that? Joaba said, "Let
[1:44:40] not the king say so."
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Well, said it and we have heard it and
[1:44:47] it's been written.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; They brought Micaiah
[1:44:51] after all deal to compromise that the
[1:44:54] prophet of the Lord rejected.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; You all know the story. I'm just quoting
[1:44:58] it. Amen.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; And Micaiah even showed him
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; the secret behind all his prophets
[1:45:05] saying the same thing.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Did you catch that?
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; He revealed all the entire mysteries to
[1:45:11] him.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; But because he is not of the Lord,
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; he can't he couldn't catch it.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; It so Jehoshaphat. Wait, this is the
[1:45:21] danger. This is what I'm pointing out.
[1:45:23] It so bad Jehoshaphat. But Jehoshaphat
[1:45:26] was too carried away
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; because he doesn't want to ought Ahab.
[1:45:32] Now he was the one who asked for a
[1:45:34] second opinion. The opinion had come and
[1:45:37] yet he remained too weak
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; to take a decision by the genuine
[1:45:43] opinion.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; And that was why Jehoshaphat sealed his
[1:45:50] own doom. the doom of his generation.
[1:45:56] What he should have done at that moment
[1:45:58] is to say, "Hey, at this moment, I think
[1:46:03] I don't mean to hurt you."
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; But if you take it as ought forgive me,
[1:46:09] I can't go any further because let me
[1:46:12] tell you, somebody has got to be ought
[1:46:14] in the process.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; When you are not oughting man, you are
[1:46:17] oughting God.
[1:46:20] Have not the faith of our Lord Jesus
[1:46:23] Christ with respect of persons?
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; Are you with me brethren?
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Jehoshaphat went to that battle and it
[1:46:32] was Ahab's plan to donate Jehoshaphat to
[1:46:37] use Jehoshaphat as a ransom for himself.
[1:46:41] That's why the prophet said the children
[1:46:43] of this world are smarter and wiser.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Even though weaker, they are smarter in
[1:46:49] their generation.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; They are good, but they will push you to
[1:46:53] the guillotin and jump over it
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; while you as a lamb, you will stick your
[1:46:58] neck inside.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet said. Yes,
[1:47:03] that's right.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Even Aam knew better than to joke with
[1:47:09] the words of Micaiah.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; That was why out of panic and fear, he
[1:47:13] said, "You know what? I will change the
[1:47:15] battle strategy.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; I will not dress as a king this time.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; But you, Jehoshaphat dress as a king.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; What? What is that?"
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; And Jehoshaphat was too dull
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; to see the plot.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; And God said, "Don't kill nobody else
[1:47:31] than here." He told the Syrians, "Leave
[1:47:34] my he leave my people of Israel alone.
[1:47:36] Target to that guy."
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; And the Hab has disguised himself
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; till the battle was over. Nobody could
[1:47:45] get here.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; But the Lord who can identify who was
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; he told one Syrian soldier, he said,
[1:47:52] "You came with this spear all the way
[1:47:54] from your country, right?" He said yes.
[1:47:57] And you carried an heavy load coming and
[1:47:59] you didn't achieve your him and you are
[1:48:01] carrying the load back again. Is that
[1:48:03] not double trouble for one man?
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; Are there no more rods and ions to make
[1:48:09] more spears in
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; in Syria? He said yes there are. So why
[1:48:13] waste your time? Just throw it away.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; And he said that makes sense. That makes
[1:48:18] sense. And he threw it. He just look at
[1:48:20] let me let me eat that fruit and the
[1:48:23] angel of the Lord pick it. Amen.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Because thus say the Lord
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; can never fail.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; And he picked the spear and he came to
[1:48:33] where because only God can identify
[1:48:35] here.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; And he came to where here was. He said,
[1:48:38] "Thus say the Lord can never fail.
[1:48:43] [Music]
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Jehoshaphat escaped it
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; by God's providence." You know the
[1:48:50] Syrians wanted to kill him
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; until he identified himself. That was
[1:48:55] what wanted to do.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; All right. But when he came back home,
[1:48:58] God told him
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; God welcomed him with a prophecy
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; that should have make that man quick and
[1:49:05] repented.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; But you know what? Jehoshaphat repeated
[1:49:09] the class again
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; by joining affinity with the son of
[1:49:13] Ahab.
[1:49:15] And from there family uh family
[1:49:18] friendship began. That was where the son
[1:49:21] of Jehoshaphat became attracted to the
[1:49:24] daughter of Jezebel
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; and
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; and he married her.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; And when the son of Jehoshaphat took
[1:49:30] over the throne, they called him
[1:49:32] Jehoram. The Bible said he was too
[1:49:34] wicked.
[1:49:36] the wickedness that was not in his
[1:49:38] lineage. He showed it until he killed
[1:49:41] all his own brothers who were not
[1:49:43] struggling the throne with him. He wiped
[1:49:45] out all the generations of Jehoshaphat
[1:49:49] because the Bible said he has the wife,
[1:49:51] he has the daughter of Jezebel
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; as his wife.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; So you saw where it came
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; and from there go and look at it. It was
[1:50:02] the daughter of Jezebel who eventually
[1:50:04] took over the throne. That's right.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; of Judah atallayah
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; and wiped out the rest of the remnant.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; It was only the mercy of God to David
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; that preserved one seed for Jehoshaphat.
[1:50:16] Everything was wiped out
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; because of poor identification. Don't
[1:50:21] bequitch evil to your generation.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; You love him tonight.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Okay, that's on the negative side. Let
[1:50:33] me give you one on the positive side and
[1:50:36] we can see if the world can identify us
[1:50:38] if there is time. If there's no time,
[1:50:39] bro, Moses will take care of that.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; One day Jesus was invited to Simon's
[1:50:50] house.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Simon the Pharisee. Do you remember him?
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. It looks like an honorable
[1:50:57] invitation,
[1:50:58] but it turned out to be a setup.
[1:51:02] And you will wonder why Jesus our Lord
[1:51:06] we allowed himself to be set off.
[1:51:09] Is it that he didn't know?
[1:51:12] The Lord knows what he's doing.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; He's the master of all circumstance.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Whatever the devil taught as a ploy to
[1:51:18] disgrace God will turn out a blessing
[1:51:22] for somebody.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Simon the Pharisees invited our Lord to
[1:51:28] his feast. Brother Aram said Jesus keep
[1:51:31] all his appointments.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; If he could honor the invitation of
[1:51:35] Simon the Pharisee, he can honor the
[1:51:37] invitation of his children.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; So just invite him into your heart
[1:51:40] tonight
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; and you will find him there.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; He's going to come to your home. He's
[1:51:45] going to come to your job. Amen.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; The prophet told us when Mr. Cabbury
[1:51:51] Foodcraft and the rest of them were
[1:51:53] struggling with their businesses. He
[1:51:55] said one of them woke up one day and
[1:51:58] heard a loud voice. He said, "Make Jesus
[1:52:00] your partner."
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; Go and read their story. Great Christian
[1:52:05] men who set up enduring multinational
[1:52:08] legacies.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Said make Christ your partner. And the
[1:52:12] men woke up and said today Christ is the
[1:52:14] partner of this business.
[1:52:16] And that is why after they have gone,
[1:52:18] their business is still surviving
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; because all may change. Jesus never.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; So invite him into your life.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Invite him into your home.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; If you bring him to your home, don't
[1:52:30] make him a guest.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; That's a poor position.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Because brother Arab said wherever you
[1:52:36] put him, that's where he stays.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; So make him the householder
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; so that he can take responsibility for
[1:52:42] whatever goes out or whatever comes in.
[1:52:45] Let him be the land owner.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; You'll be more protected that way.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; So they brought Jesus to the party or to
[1:52:54] the feast. But
[1:52:57] even though he came by special
[1:52:58] invitation, yet he wasn't treated any
[1:53:02] special.
[1:53:04] They didn't wash his feet. They didn't,
[1:53:07] you know, towel his body, anoint him
[1:53:10] with handments to give him some cool
[1:53:12] effect and a refreshing effect in order
[1:53:15] to gather with the rest of the crowd.
[1:53:17] So, because these things were not done,
[1:53:19] he found himself out of place
[1:53:22] because he has been burning in the heat
[1:53:25] of the eastern sun, sweaty and
[1:53:27] everything. So, he found himself out of
[1:53:30] place to move with the rest of the highs
[1:53:33] who were sitting and doing their things.
[1:53:35] So Jesus was left alone in a corner
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; and they must have been celebrating to
[1:53:41] Mr. Simon the Pharisee. Ah, you got a
[1:53:44] big cash for us today. Let's make a spot
[1:53:46] out of him. See how he's there sitting
[1:53:48] down like a defeated like a conquered
[1:53:50] guy. Just look at him. Oh,
[1:53:52] congratulations. You're a big man. They
[1:53:55] were happy.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; But you see, Jesus had a purpose for
[1:54:01] everything.
[1:54:03] Do you know why he kept the appointment?
[1:54:05] Because that was God's appointed day for
[1:54:08] a bigger picture.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; While the celebration was going on, we
[1:54:17] didn't know how this lady came in.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Maybe she great crashed. Maybe she came
[1:54:23] as an escort to one of the big men.
[1:54:26] Maybe she was it was in her neighborhood
[1:54:28] and she heard that do you know that
[1:54:31] Jesus of Nazareth is in that feast is in
[1:54:35] that feast and we do everything I can to
[1:54:38] enter that place
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; we don't know the circumstance that got
[1:54:41] her inside
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; but when she came inside
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; she chose to identify
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; glory
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; with the person that was rejected
[1:54:57] And it was this identification,
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; amen,
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; that rewrote our life.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ our Lord said, "Wherever
[1:55:04] the gospel of Christ is being preached,
[1:55:07] mention will be made of her."
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; Tonight, this scripture
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; is fulfilled again.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; What did she do
[1:55:17] when she looked perfectly
[1:55:20] and truly assertaining that that is
[1:55:23] Jesus Christ of Nazareth?
[1:55:26] She said, "I won't miss today."
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; The Bible said she went back to her
[1:55:31] house
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; to do what? To empty all our savings.
[1:55:35] That's the language of the word.
[1:55:37] Everything she had because the kind of
[1:55:40] oil, the perfume oil she was going to
[1:55:42] buy will cost everything.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; Is a big box of alabaster oil.
[1:55:50] And in Israel, they told us that this
[1:55:53] box of alabaster oil that this woman
[1:55:56] purchased, uh, the cost of it equals the
[1:56:00] annual wages, not monthly wages, of six
[1:56:03] elitist soldiers,
[1:56:06] imperial guards of the majesty. So you
[1:56:09] could imagine how much they'll be
[1:56:11] earning when you put the annual wages of
[1:56:13] six of them together. That was why Judas
[1:56:16] is carry
[1:56:21] You know why he was mad? Said, "Why such
[1:56:25] a waste?" He forget it was being done to
[1:56:27] his master.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; He said, "This this money could have
[1:56:31] been used to set up a foundation that
[1:56:34] might have taken care of maybe 200 poor
[1:56:36] families
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; and we're just wasting it one time."
[1:56:41] Even though it looked as if he had
[1:56:42] consent for the poor,
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; the Bible said no.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; No, he said he's a thief.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible said. Because he
[1:56:52] holds the bag.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Even if he did they seeded the money to
[1:56:56] do the foundation, he's already looking
[1:56:58] at the percentages that he will swallow
[1:57:00] out of it.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; That was his interest, not the poor.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible said not that he cared
[1:57:07] for the poor.
[1:57:09] Mhm.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; But I'm trying to show you how costly
[1:57:12] that oil was.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; And it took a hall.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; It's got to take you all
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; to serve the Lord.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said,
[1:57:25] not minding what people will say, she
[1:57:28] brought the oil.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; She started weeping.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Gathered enough tears. I don't know the
[1:57:35] quantity, but it was enough to do what
[1:57:38] Simon couldn't do
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; to wash his feet. And she turned her
[1:57:43] hair to towel to wipe the feet. And she
[1:57:47] poured the oil on my Lord.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; And when Judas was annoyed with that,
[1:57:57] Jesus told them, "Why?
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; You thought I came to eat rice. I came
[1:58:01] to eat potatoes." Yeah. Some turkey
[1:58:05] slices of some chicken here.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; Grilled saloin steak. You think that was
[1:58:11] why I came here? I came here to be
[1:58:13] anointed for my burial.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; This was the chosen place.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "This woman has done this for
[1:58:21] my burial."
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; That was why when Jesus died and the
[1:58:26] sisters were bringing spices to anoint
[1:58:28] the body, read your Bible. Did they
[1:58:29] succeed? They couldn't find a body to
[1:58:32] anoint because it's been anointed
[1:58:34] already for the burial.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; That was how powerful the revelation of
[1:58:40] the sister was. And that was why Christ
[1:58:42] had to keep that appointment. She
[1:58:44] identified
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; with the Lord Jesus Christ and it's
[1:58:49] under eternal life.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; When she was doing that, Simon and his
[1:58:53] friends, they said, "We got them.
[1:58:56] We got them." And they called all the
[1:58:59] press men that came and said, "Give us
[1:59:01] strategic pictures because we got to
[1:59:04] make an headlines tomorrow." And they
[1:59:06] were already congratulating themselves.
[1:59:08] Sir, you are too intelligent. We must
[1:59:11] make you a night of St. Order of John.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; How you will get us get this man so we
[1:59:17] can oh, we can deal with this matter
[1:59:19] once and for all. And Jesus heard what
[1:59:22] they were saying, but he waited for the
[1:59:24] woman to finish. And when he finished,
[1:59:27] he said, "Simon, come over here."
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; I have someone to tell you.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; Let me give you a small quiz if you can
[1:59:35] answer.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Uh there are two fellows who hold their
[1:59:39] master. One hold the master $100,000
[1:59:43] Canadian dollars
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; and another $10,000 Canadian dollars and
[1:59:48] he forgave the two of them. Who do you
[1:59:51] think will love the master most? Simon
[1:59:54] said that's a simple equation. It's even
[1:59:57] arithmetic. It's not mathematics. I
[1:59:59] thought you were going to give me a
[2:00:00] complex quadratic equations. That one is
[2:00:03] simple, master. The simple answer, the
[2:00:07] man to whom he forgave much.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, you answered well.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; You are very smart.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; So now let's bring it home.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; So you invited me here since I came.
[2:00:23] You neglected me.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; You are minding your friends, having
[2:00:26] good times, and enjoying yourself. But
[2:00:29] guess what? Since this woman discovered
[2:00:31] me,
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; she hasn't ceased to do this and to do
[2:00:35] that. Now, our sins, which are many
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; She got the forgiveness of our sins by
[2:00:46] identification.
[2:00:48] Our sins which are many,
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; the ones that you are building cases
[2:00:53] for,
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; that you are trying to build scandal in
[2:00:56] the newspapers tomorrow for, they are
[2:00:58] all forgiven.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; When your journalists go to the press
[2:01:02] tomorrow, tell them to add this also.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; That was the end of the plot.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; She got eternal life and she hand her
[2:01:11] place in God's kingdom by the right
[2:01:13] identification.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; God bless you saints.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:19] Time wait for me to continue on that.
[2:01:21] Let's drop this.
[2:01:25] [Applause]
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Brother Bram said when
[2:01:31] the seals are opened.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; You know we have three phases of the
[2:01:36] ministry. Sign in the hand.
[2:01:40] The ability to tell the secret of heart
[2:01:43] healing service. Then the opening of the
[2:01:45] word. Brother Abraham said those first
[2:01:50] two things are sign
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; and there must be a voice behind every
[2:01:54] sign.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; The voice is actually the one that
[2:01:59] separated the bride
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; from the crowd that we attracted by
[2:02:04] signs and wonders.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Pro Moses will expand on it.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; All right. But this is what I want to
[2:02:10] say. And the message anointed once at
[2:02:13] the end time.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; The prophet said when the seals are
[2:02:17] opened
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; which is the opening of the word which
[2:02:21] it described as the shout in the message
[2:02:23] rapture
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; which is the first stage of the
[2:02:28] condescension of the Lord. The coming of
[2:02:30] the Lord by which we know towards
[2:02:33] rapture and body change is a process.
[2:02:37] The prophet said that when those seals
[2:02:41] are opened, when that shout is sounded,
[2:02:43] three things will happen.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; One, the world will be in a sodom
[2:02:49] condition.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; You don't need to be told.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; It's all around you.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; Number two, James and Jambers will
[2:02:59] arise.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; He's presently working. That's the
[2:03:02] current revival.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Anything that stands against
[2:03:08] the message of the Exodus that attacks
[2:03:10] it either from outside or from inside is
[2:03:13] by the anointing of James and Jambers.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; You remember James and Jabas were
[2:03:17] Egyptians
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; who never even followed in the Exodus.
[2:03:21] You remember that? But there were those
[2:03:23] who carried the anointing
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; and were following the Exodus. They
[2:03:28] Quran and Habiran.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; Aha.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; So there will be outside one, there will
[2:03:34] be inside one. So when you see people
[2:03:36] who have preached the message for 40, 50
[2:03:38] years and are now attacking the message,
[2:03:41] nothing is out of place.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; Don't let your faith be discomforted. In
[2:03:46] fact, that should make you love the
[2:03:48] message the more
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; that should vindicate to you the more
[2:03:51] that the message is the truth. If those
[2:03:53] things are not happening, then the
[2:03:55] sermon is not correct. Because the
[2:03:57] prophet in the message anointed once,
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; how appropriate that message was and how
[2:04:02] appropriate it is for him to drop it in
[2:04:05] that message. He said three things will
[2:04:07] happen.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; The world will be in the Sodom
[2:04:09] condition.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; James and Jambers will arise. Then
[2:04:13] number three, there will be the
[2:04:14] revelation of the son of man.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Now you must get what he meant there. He
[2:04:21] is the one that brought the revelation
[2:04:23] of the son of man. But he also told us
[2:04:26] there will be the revelation. The son of
[2:04:29] man will be revealed.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; What is he saying? Brother Arab said I
[2:04:34] must talk about that because that is
[2:04:35] you. Now amen. Brother Abraham said the
[2:04:38] revelation of the son of man ministry
[2:04:41] Luke 17:30
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; is to unite the head with the body.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; Christ and his bride
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; in what? In marriage.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; That's right. Are you with me brethren?
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; Why will it take the opening of the word
[2:05:01] for these three things to happen?
[2:05:03] Because brother said that is the
[2:05:05] unbeliever, the make believer and the
[2:05:07] believer being identified. Why will it
[2:05:10] take those three things to happen to be
[2:05:12] identified by the opening of the word?
[2:05:14] Because the opening of the word is the
[2:05:16] light of the hour.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; And every seed must interact with
[2:05:20] sunlight. Every vegetative life must
[2:05:24] interact with sunlight in order to
[2:05:27] develop
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; in their different stages of growth and
[2:05:32] manifest the character that they are.
[2:05:35] The power of transformation is not to
[2:05:37] change a mango to an apple, but is to
[2:05:40] make an apple to grow in different
[2:05:42] stages of development until it comes to
[2:05:45] a point of fruition.
[2:05:49] So the sun is not going to change grass
[2:05:51] to wheat.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; Neither is it going to change mango to
[2:05:55] orange, but it's going to make each of
[2:05:57] them grow. So both the good plants and
[2:06:00] the bad plants will grow by the same
[2:06:02] sunlight.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. So because the dynamics of all
[2:06:08] this plantage plant life is in the hand
[2:06:10] of one son.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; All plant life manufactur their food
[2:06:16] through the process of photosynthesis by
[2:06:19] sunlight.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; No plant will survive good or bad
[2:06:23] without sunlight. Is that telling you
[2:06:25] something? The light of the hour must
[2:06:28] shine
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; for every seed whether good or bad
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; to come to fruition.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; So nothing is wrong with the message of
[2:06:39] the how.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; The message represent the only light
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; to quicken every seed.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; This is why Judas's scariot needed to
[2:06:48] interact with Jesus as much as Peter
[2:06:51] needed it. By their interaction, Judas
[2:06:54] will not become Jesus. Neither will
[2:06:57] Judas will not become Peter. Neither
[2:06:59] will Peter become Judas.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; No matter what happened. But Peter will
[2:07:03] grow to be Peter and manifest as Peter.
[2:07:07] Judas will grow to be Judas and manifest
[2:07:09] as Judas. In fact, when Judas was ripe
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; for his service, it was Jesus that gave
[2:07:15] him his anointing.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; That which thou doest,
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; do quickly. The Bible said he gave him a
[2:07:22] sword and by the time he received the
[2:07:24] sword a strange spirit entered him.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the only person conscious of
[2:07:28] what was happening and he said Judas get
[2:07:30] busy and do your job.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; The dynamics of the false church, the
[2:07:36] dynamics of the true church is in the
[2:07:39] hand of only one man. The message of the
[2:07:41] hour.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; So there's nothing wrong with the
[2:07:45] message. But why James and Jambers are
[2:07:48] living true to their identity and
[2:07:50] unbelievers are crashing
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; and becoming so apostate and
[2:07:56] and evil.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; Let us show that the bride of Christ is
[2:07:59] becoming glorious.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you if the marriage wasn't
[2:08:04] contracted brother would not have left
[2:08:06] here.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; I close with this line.
[2:08:11] He said, "What God sent me to do is to
[2:08:13] establish a relationship, a union
[2:08:16] between God and man,
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; bring them in marriage." And when the
[2:08:20] prophet saw that accomplished, what did
[2:08:22] he do? He offered a thanksgiving
[2:08:24] message, invisible union.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; He said, "This message is my own
[2:08:30] thanksgiving." America was celebrating
[2:08:32] their thanksgiving. He said, "But that's
[2:08:34] not what he's celebrating now." He said,
[2:08:36] "He's celebrating his own thanksgiving."
[2:08:38] The purpose for which God brought him,
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; he saw it accomplished. And when his
[2:08:44] purpose was accomplished, he already
[2:08:46] told us it doesn't need to be here
[2:08:47] again. That was why he preached it in
[2:08:49] November. In December, the Lord took him
[2:08:51] home.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; The bride came in marriage with the
[2:08:54] groom.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; The union is necessary.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; Because the bride must reproduce.
[2:09:02] He needs to encounter a male
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; to bring forth Christ again
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; on two feet. It is the bringing of
[2:09:09] Christ again
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; by the unity that comes with the
[2:09:13] revelation of the son of man that is the
[2:09:16] son of man again revealed.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; This is the hour we are in friends.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; This is why we come to the church
[2:09:24] tonight. You could have been doing other
[2:09:26] things but you came to lay in the
[2:09:28] presence of the SOM to pack the seed of
[2:09:31] your husband
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; in God's own secret place. Hallelujah.
[2:09:35] Where relationship consummation is
[2:09:37] possible so that you can be what?
[2:09:40] Impregnated
[2:09:41] by your husband to bring forth. Don't
[2:09:44] forget this job must testify.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; And the testimony of Jesus Christ is the
[2:09:50] spirit of prophecy. The he said he must
[2:09:52] prophesy. The testimony of Jesus Christ
[2:09:55] is the spirit of that prophecy. You must
[2:09:57] reproduce Christ again on two feet. So
[2:10:00] you become the final revelation of the
[2:10:02] son of man.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; That is the message of the hour. The
[2:10:06] revealed word identifying you, blessing
[2:10:09] you in your position as the bride, as
[2:10:12] the elect. God bless you. Enjoy the
[2:10:15] journey. Shalom.
[2:10:19] [Applause]
[2:10:29] Bless you, sir. Thank you.
[2:10:51] I have a lot of homeworks to work on.
[2:10:58] But it was wonderful. Amen.
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. We have been blessed
[2:11:02] this evening. Amen.
[2:11:05] God has been good to us. Praise be to
[2:11:07] God. Amen. Brother Joseph will need you
[2:11:10] as well just to help me as well from
[2:11:11] time to time if you don't want mind.
[2:11:14] Praise be to God. I don't know what to
[2:11:16] add on top on top of that. I just say
[2:11:18] Lord I accept your word.
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; I accept your word. As a as a as a
[2:11:24] pastor daily said at the beginning we
[2:11:27] come to we come to the to the house of
[2:11:29] God. It's a the place like going to the
[2:11:31] hospital either to be healed or for a
[2:11:36] checkup.
[2:11:37] Father Lord, if there is anything that
[2:11:39] is that is not correct, Father, take it
[2:11:42] away. Father, thank you for helping me
[2:11:45] to to check up my life to look into the
[2:11:48] mirror of the word to realize Lord,
[2:11:51] where am I? I want to see myself in the
[2:11:54] mirror of the word of God and say, "Oh,
[2:11:56] it's me, mama. It's me." Amen. How many
[2:11:59] want say Lord I I I want I I I want to
[2:12:03] be the revelation of Jesus Christ as
[2:12:06] Jesus Christ was the revelation of the
[2:12:08] father. I want to be the revelation of
[2:12:11] Jesus Christ. That's my desire. I I want
[2:12:15] to serve you more. I I want to search in
[2:12:17] the scripture in the volume of the book
[2:12:20] it's written of me. I want to find
[2:12:22] myself. I want to identify myself in the
[2:12:25] word of God. I want to know my place in
[2:12:27] the scripture. And as I identified it,
[2:12:30] Lord, I I want I want to hang on it.
[2:12:33] Amen. Think about that. Auntie Jeremiah.
[2:12:36] She was so sure that he is going to
[2:12:39] come. No matter what, he is going to
[2:12:42] come. Why? Because the scripture cannot
[2:12:44] be broken. The type cannot be broken.
[2:12:47] He's going to pass here. I might wait
[2:12:50] longer. I might take time, but I know
[2:12:52] he's going to pass here. Amen.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; The message of the Yahweh we have
[2:12:56] received can never fail.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; The same pillar of fire will lead us
[2:13:01] into the millennium. Amen. Just stay
[2:13:03] with the word of God. Just feed upon the
[2:13:06] word of God. Just keep confessing the
[2:13:08] word of God. It's the word of God. Amen.
[2:13:11] It will never fail. Amen. Oh, wonderful.
[2:13:15] Amen. Oh, I really enjoy the word of
[2:13:17] God. Let's stand together and give it

[2:16:47] Let's bow our head as the music is
[2:16:49] playing softly.
[2:16:51] I just want to
[2:16:53] The message was so good. I just bow our
[2:16:57] head. But
[2:17:00] If it's possible, I think we can go on
[2:17:02] the website
[2:17:04] and listen to it again and
[2:17:07] just to
[2:17:09] digest everything that was said. But
[2:17:11] many things, many deep wonderful things
[2:17:14] were said as we can just ponder upon
[2:17:17] that. Lord, how can I apply the token in
[2:17:22] my family?
[2:17:24] Lord,
[2:17:26] how how is it my life?
[2:17:30] my association with others.
[2:17:33] How can I identify myself in the
[2:17:36] scripture?
[2:17:38] How can I find the principles the way
[2:17:41] you work in the scripture? All those
[2:17:44] great secret that has been given to us
[2:17:47] as the ministers, the Holy Spirit came
[2:17:49] to the ministers telling us there are
[2:17:51] many blessings but sometimes we we miss
[2:17:54] it because we miss the principle of God,
[2:17:57] the way of God.
[2:17:59] Oh God, help help us to
[2:18:02] to understand your way to have the
[2:18:06] discernment to have the revelation to
[2:18:09] know your way.
[2:18:11] Is that the desire of your heart? Lord
[2:18:12] Father, I don't want to miss the
[2:18:14] blessings that you have in store for me.
[2:18:17] Sometimes we look too much to the
[2:18:19] symptoms, but help me to be like, hide,
[2:18:22] to do the right thing, to say the right
[2:18:25] thing,
[2:18:27] to say what the word of God says,
[2:18:31] to do the even the small things that
[2:18:34] sometimes we put aside, but Lord, help
[2:18:36] me to be faithful in the small thing as
[2:18:38] in the big things.
[2:18:40] Is that the desire of your heart this
[2:18:42] evening?
[2:18:44] Can you just talk to the Lord this
[2:18:45] evening as we will be closing but in
[2:18:48] your own way? Father, I came to the
[2:18:50] church as I go to the hospital.
[2:18:54] Father, I came to
[2:18:56] see and check my statute in the word of
[2:18:59] God and see where I am. And Lord, you
[2:19:02] have spoken to me and I accept it. I
[2:19:06] believe it. I'll be like head to right
[2:19:09] and say Lord this is nothing else but
[2:19:12] the truth
[2:19:14] and I accepted it father Lord Jesus
[2:19:17] Christ I desire to walk with you to see
[2:19:20] identify myself
[2:19:23] with the character of the Bible to see
[2:19:26] their outcome. If the outcome succeeded
[2:19:29] my outcome will succeed too.
[2:19:32] Actually my life gives more details to
[2:19:35] the type and the shadow of the Bible
[2:19:39] because now it has come to the full
[2:19:41] manifestation as I've receive the s n
[2:19:45] the son of righteousness that has come
[2:19:47] father to display the nature of the sea
[2:19:51] that was inside of me.
[2:19:54] Them without us cannot come to
[2:19:56] perfection. Lord help me to walk with
[2:19:58] you. My desires to walk with you. My
[2:20:02] desire Lord is to dig deeper to know my
[2:20:05] time and and the season of of the
[2:20:08] message for my time. Revelation 10 8-11.
[2:20:12] Eat the book. Eat the book. Make it part
[2:20:15] of you and then prophesy. Lord, the
[2:20:19] testimony of the Jesus Christ is the
[2:20:22] spirit of prophecy. Let me testify. Let
[2:20:24] me be like Jesus to manifest the life of
[2:20:27] Jesus Christ. And if I give and I search
[2:20:31] the kingdom, the rest will be given unto
[2:20:33] me. Because everything that I have need
[2:20:36] of is contained into the kingdom. It
[2:20:38] contained in the Holy Ghost. That's why
[2:20:42] the Holy Ghost is important. The new

[2:27:56] brethren receive the baptism of the Holy
[2:27:57] Ghost they said this is the submit this

[2:28:17] nothing about.
[2:28:19] &gt;&gt; So never limit God to the certain
[2:28:21] things. Continue to tap into the those
[2:28:25] untapped resources of God, the more you
[2:28:28] know his ways, the know more his
[2:28:30] principle, the more you see in this
[2:28:32] scripture, those untapped resource, you
[2:28:35] can have access to it. Amen. God bless
[2:28:38] you richly. greet one another and and
[2:28:41] and and
[2:28:43] be kind to one another and God bless you
[2:28:45] richly. Amen.

[2:29:11] there is a kind sister who has provided
[2:29:13] some um some donuts after service. So
[2:29:17] you have been fed spiritually but after
[2:29:20] church those who can get a donut after
[2:29:23] service outside of the church not really
[2:29:26] but there is some donuts and deep meats
[2:29:28] being provided. So God bless you richly.
[2:29:31] You are dismissed. I will not be denied.
[2:29:33] Amen.
[2:29:36] Jesus
[2:29:39] and
[2:29:41] me.
