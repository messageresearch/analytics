[12:59] that's why I'm doing it today.
[13:02] Well, praise the Lord.
[13:04] &gt;&gt; Lord is faithful. Very, very faithful.
[13:06] &gt;&gt; So, on my way early for church today,
[13:09] &gt;&gt; so I thought and I was driving down
[13:13] white mud and suddenly the wheel caught
[13:16] some snow on the side. I just didn't see
[13:18] it. There was lights ahead. So, I got
[13:20] pulled onto the boulevard on top of the
[13:22] snow
[13:23] &gt;&gt; and I'm trying to get over to get
[13:25] because there's another it's a exit and
[13:27] then there's the white mud
[13:28] &gt;&gt; and I'm trying to get and I'm stuck. I'm
[13:33] hung up. I'm on top of the world, the
[13:35] snow world, and not happy because I
[13:38] couldn't move. Like the tires made ice
[13:41] and I couldn't go forward. Forward. So I
[13:44] said, "Well, what will I do?" I tried
[13:46] hacking. I had a little scraper and I
[13:48] worked on that till it broke. I said,
[13:50] "Okay, now what?" I started talking to
[13:52] the Lord. I say, "This is something.
[13:54] What are you doing here?" Right? And so
[13:56] I said, "Well, I could call my roadside
[13:59] assistants." And uh I did and they said,
[14:01] "Well, we'll come in five hours."
[14:05] &gt;&gt; I said, "You don't understand." She's
[14:07] this woman in in Ontario. She says, "Um,
[14:10] yeah, I'm sorry. That's the best we can
[14:12] do. They're all stuck in the alleys
[14:13] helping people out of the the weather
[14:15] there." I said, "It's 10 degrees above."
[14:17] Well, I don't know, but we just can't
[14:18] five hours. I said, "Brother Andrew,
[14:22] Brother Joseph." So I I gave them a text
[14:24] each and they got in touch and they come
[14:26] down. They're going to come. I had toll
[14:28] ropes. I couldn't budge and so uh I was
[14:31] stuck there waiting and it was just
[14:34] about4 to 6 when it started and they
[14:36] came finally around whenever I called
[14:39] after I tried my exhausted my own
[14:41] efforts and in the meanwhile I was
[14:43] talking to the Lord said you know Lord
[14:45] it'd be pretty easy for you to just send
[14:47] somebody with a truck. I thought brother
[14:50] Joseph had one but he doesn't anymore.
[14:52] So, um, I continued to wait and lo and
[14:55] behold, all of a sudden, a young man
[14:57] named Abby and Indian descent truck,
[15:00] tires on the truck, half ton, he's got
[15:04] to ropes. Yeah, we can do this. We
[15:06] hooked it up and out we came.
[15:08] &gt;&gt; So, praise the Lord.
[15:11] &gt;&gt; And what an answer to prayer because uh
[15:14] the Lord is able to do these little
[15:16] things for us. And it was more than a
[15:18] little because I couldn't be late for
[15:19] church. I'm here today. So, and I told
[15:22] this guy, his name is Abby. I said, and
[15:25] u very fine, like the Lord sent him.
[15:27] &gt;&gt; It's amazing. I said he helped us out
[15:30] over there. Joseph, brother Andrew
[15:31] didn't have to, you know, so he had the
[15:35] the other goods. The Lord owns
[15:36] everything anyway. So, praise God. Thank
[15:38] you. Be joyful with me. Praise the Lord.
[15:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Isn't the Lord
[15:43] wonderful? Praise the Lord. Let's just
[15:45] open up in prayer and thank him this
[15:47] this evening hour. Father in heaven,
[15:50] we're so grateful for the testimony of
[15:52] brother brother Peter's Lord Jesus. How
[15:55] you helped him out. It may seem so
[15:57] little, but Lord, you were you care care
[15:59] for the sparrows, Lord. As I'm watching
[16:02] out the window, Lord, you care for every
[16:04] sparrow, Lord, that's hungry and they're
[16:07] just coming around our feeder, Lord. And
[16:09] you feed them through our hands and you
[16:11] feed them otherwise in different ways.
[16:14] And Lord Jesus, we're more than
[16:16] sparrows. And brother is more than a
[16:18] sparrow, Lord. And you had your mind
[16:21] upon him to to show him that you're
[16:24] still real, that you're still Jehovah,
[16:26] the provider, the Jehovah Gyra, the Lord
[16:29] that provides all our needs, Lord. And I

[17:24] remembering Brother Victor over there in
[17:26] in in Ontario. Lord Jesus, oh God, his
[17:30] mother was sick. I heard I read that on
[17:32] the internet. She was sick. She wasn't
[17:34] able to speak. But Lord, you caused her
[17:37] to speak again, Lord. And you're
[17:39] restoring her, Lord. And I pray that
[17:41] you'd bless that family, Lord. and use
[17:44] them mightily. Lord, I pray for brother
[17:46] Luke Freeman. Lord Jesus, I pray that

[17:58] well. In the name of Jesus, Lord, you
[18:00] came Lord. You paid the price for our
[18:03] salvation and for our healing.
[18:06] And Lord Jesus, Matthew, Lord God,
[18:08] sister Claudia's son, Lord, oh God in
[18:12] heaven, you see him as he is, Lord
[18:15] Jesus, he needs a touch from heaven.
[18:18] Lord Jesus, I I pray that you would not
[18:20] let him rest. Lord, I until he seeks you
[18:23] and finds you, Lord Jesus. It's We don't
[18:27] want him to be anxious, but Lord, we
[18:29] want him to be so restless until he
[18:31] finds that peace, that peace that passes
[18:34] all human understanding. So, I pray, oh
[18:37] God, that you would speak. Doesn't
[18:38] matter how you do it, Lord, just bring
[18:40] him in again, oh Lord, the whole family,
[18:43] Lord. Daniel and and what's the other
[18:45] ones? Juan. Yeah, John. We call him

[18:53] too, Lord. You see the different needs,
[18:56] Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. We bring them
[18:59] all before you in Jesus' name. I pray,
[19:01] Brother Terren, Lord, he hasn't shown
[19:03] his face for maybe for weeks and weeks,
[19:06] Lord. I pray that you would speak to his
[19:09] heart, to his children, his boys. Oh
[19:12] God, I don't know what has happened, but
[19:14] Lord Jesus, may you come on the scene
[19:17] and touch his life. Lord, you you
[19:19] brought him in here, Lord Jesus, for a
[19:21] purpose. May that purpose not be wasted.
[19:24] But may, oh God, you speak to his heart.
[19:27] And we'll give all the praise and all
[19:29] the honor, Lord. Those that couldn't be
[19:31] here tonight, may you bless them, Lord.

[31:00] &gt;&gt; Let's give a hand to the Lord this
[31:01] evening. Glory to his name. Glory to his
[31:06] name. Thank God I'm free.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; Imagine you have been bound in slavery
[31:12] for so many years. Then on the day of
[31:15] the emancipation say you are free now.
[31:17] You you are not bound anymore.
[31:20] &gt;&gt; You're bound. Sin, but I'm not bound
[31:22] anymore. The blood of Jesus Christ has
[31:24] loosed me and set me free.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; Thank God I'm free.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was a slave, but through the day
[31:31] of Jubilee, I heard the trumpet. I
[31:34] respond to it. Now I throw that
[31:36] instrument that was keeping me captive.
[31:39] Now I'm free. I can serve the Lord
[31:41] forever. Thank God I'm free. Oh, thank
[31:44] God I am free.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, from this world of sin.
[31:52] This world of sin. I'm washed in the
[31:55] blood of Jesus. I've been born again.
[32:01] Be born again. Hallelujah.
[32:05] Save. Save. Save by wonderful grace.
[32:13] So great.
[32:15] I found out he bring me out and show me
[32:21] the way.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; Show me the way.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; Glory to his name.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; Praise be to his name.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; It's good to be in the house of the
[32:31] Lord.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; On a Wednesday night just to recharge
[32:35] our battery. Amen.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; And then just so God, thank you for your
[32:39] grace in our lives.
[32:41] greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[32:42] Christ.

[33:43] the word of God towards their place

[33:46] restored, may they be touched, Father.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; Lord, as you are touching us this
[33:50] evening, may also touch them over there,
[33:52] Lord. We pray,
[33:54] &gt;&gt; Lord, we are expecting great time in
[33:55] your presence, through the the the
[33:58] worship. So through father prayer,
[34:01] through the word of God, help us,
[34:02] Father, as we desire a closer walk with
[34:04] you. We give you the glory and the
[34:06] honor, Lord. Bless your word in our
[34:08] heart. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[34:10] Amen.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:15] Let's give a Wednesday time of prayer.
[34:17] So just go to the word of God.
[34:20] Thank you, brothers
[34:23] and
[34:25] brother Joseph.
[34:42] just invite you to go to Matthew 6 9:10.
[34:51] We don't necessarily need to read it,
[34:53] but we have to read it because my
[34:55] opening scripture, but
[35:07] Matthew chapter 6
[35:10] 9:10
[35:18] says after this moment.
[35:22] So after this manner therefore pray ye
[35:26] our father which which art in heaven.
[35:30] Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come.
[35:34] Thy will be done in earth as it is in
[35:36] heaven. Give us this day our daily
[35:39] bread. And forgive us our debts as we
[35:43] forgive our debtors. And lead us not
[35:46] into temptation, but deliver us from
[35:48] evil. For thine is the kingdom and the
[35:51] power and the glory forever. Amen.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless his word. They just have
[35:58] a sit
[36:01] on a day of a time of prayer as a we
[36:04] have different needs.
[36:06] How many are needs are need have a need
[36:08] in their heart? Lord, I have a need.
[36:10] Myself, I have a need. All have needs
[36:14] and we are needy people. But we have a
[36:17] God who answers to prayers.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; I was fellowshipping with someone said,
[36:22] "Why do you have so many needs?" Say,
[36:23] "Yeah, that that's what that's good." If
[36:26] you have so many needs because God did
[36:29] not come for those who didn't have any
[36:30] need. He comes for those who have a
[36:33] need. that where his attribute has been
[36:35] will be manifested to show who is God.
[36:38] So we it's good sometimes to have needs
[36:41] so that it shows and and to recognize
[36:43] that we have needs. Some have needs but
[36:45] they don't recognize that they have
[36:46] needs. But as we are not we don't have
[36:49] that spirit of leicia that say I don't I
[36:51] don't need you. I don't need God. But we
[36:53] need God constantly all the time
[36:56] &gt;&gt; and we desire just him to be manifest in
[36:59] our lives. I would like to call this a
[37:01] little bit subject. Let thy kingdom
[37:03] come. Let thy kingdom come. A little bit
[37:06] of just
[37:08] parenthesis of what we touched on on on
[37:10] Sunday. Let thy king let that let thy
[37:13] kingdom come.
[37:15] Here Jesus Christ is teaching his
[37:17] disciples how to pray. You know they're
[37:20] wondering how to pray and John the
[37:22] Baptist has taught his disciples how to
[37:24] pray. How come we you don't teach us how
[37:26] to pray? I said no. Then he told them
[37:28] this is the way you have to pray. This
[37:30] is the manner. Not necessarily exactly
[37:32] the same words but it has to follow a
[37:35] bit the same structure and you see the
[37:37] importance is putting and if you have
[37:39] really go through it and each one I
[37:41] remember when I was a student I was in
[37:44] Ontario and I went to one brother there
[37:45] in his church and he took he took a
[37:47] series just on this prayers. He went on
[37:50] each word and each sentence. So just
[37:54] wonderful how we how we can grasp out of
[37:57] that prayer see many things that related
[37:59] to to what God has unveiled. But one
[38:01] just thought here Jesus says you start
[38:04] by saying our father you call God our
[38:08] father
[38:10] it's not just by calling God as our
[38:12] father just by the expression as our
[38:14] father Jesus Christ actually himself
[38:16] said don't call anybody father because
[38:17] there is only one father one true father
[38:20] and is is our lord Jesus Christ is god
[38:22] himself but as you call god our father
[38:25] you need to have also revelation of what
[38:28] is really being our father if he's our
[38:30] father and you come as a father. You go
[38:32] to God's prayer says I'm coming to God
[38:35] as my father.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; You don't come to God as as as as a as a
[38:40] master of slaves. No, you come to God we
[38:43] have a relationship between father and
[38:46] son, father and daughter. You don't come
[38:48] to God with fear. You don't come God
[38:50] trembling. You don't want God wondering
[38:53] whether he loves you or not. No. A real
[38:56] parent loves his children. And the
[38:58] children as they come they know that as
[39:00] they're coming to ask for a prayer ask
[39:02] for this request my father loves me he's
[39:06] going to give me the best he's going to
[39:08] give me the best so Jesus emphasizing
[39:10] you call him our father Amen if he's our
[39:13] father there is a relationship amen it's
[39:16] not just saying that I say just to say
[39:18] by by saying but because if you call him
[39:20] the father means he has begotten you he
[39:24] has given you life he's the one who has
[39:26] given you life so you have recognize
[39:28] that the the the nature of the father is
[39:31] also your nature. Amen.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; If God is our father is of the same
[39:35] nature. If you see in the animal
[39:36] kingdom, even human kingdom, you see
[39:38] animal kingdom, a lion gives it to a
[39:41] little lion. If you see the fish and you
[39:44] give a fish, we don't change the spaces
[39:46] species, right? If God gives give birth
[39:49] to a son, that that son is also a small
[39:52] god.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; He's alo the same nature as God. He has
[39:56] all the attribute of God in that little
[39:58] in that in maybe in a small the small
[40:00] amount but he has the same nature as
[40:03] God. As we recognize that we become more
[40:07] and more and more and more and more uh
[40:11] more and more acquainted with it and we
[40:13] have more revelation of it. It has to
[40:15] become life in our lives. Amen.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; You say if he's a father it means that
[40:19] you have the same characteristic. You
[40:22] have the seed genes of your father.
[40:25] Prophet said in things that are to be
[40:26] said, that's where we are. We have
[40:28] become from mortal beings from time
[40:30] beings to eternal beings. When the word
[40:33] of God lit our souls and we become sons
[40:36] and daughters of God with the attribute,
[40:39] the gene of God in us to be sons and
[40:42] daughters of God.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; The genes is manifesting a certain
[40:46] attribute. The gene is the gene manifest
[40:50] a certain attribute.
[40:52] Every cell has different genes. They
[40:54] have different genes and different
[40:55] different characteristic different
[40:56] attribute. Each one of us is expressing
[40:59] a certain attribute of God.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Each one of us is expressing certain
[41:03] characteristic of God. So if you come in
[41:06] prayer, you come with revelation, you
[41:09] realize that you are expressing God's
[41:11] nature. You are expressing what God is.
[41:15] If God is forgiving, you are forgiving.
[41:17] If God is full of love, you are full of
[41:19] love. If God is is not worried, you
[41:23] don't you will not get worried. Amen.
[41:25] God has peace. You have peace. God is
[41:27] shalom. You have shalom. Amen.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Because what God is, you are too. YOU
[41:32] EXPRESSING GOD. AMEN.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; GOD is our father.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; It's hard to we take it for granted. But
[41:39] that's the the the religious people the
[41:41] old religions have they're fearing God
[41:45] know like in India they have their god
[41:48] even to have a relationship with their
[41:50] god no how can he be my father no he's
[41:54] he's way above god certainly they their
[41:58] god are not even true god they're just
[41:59] idols
[42:00] &gt;&gt; but that respect that have they can't
[42:02] just re be related to their god their
[42:05] god is way here there they are way here
[42:08] but our god Indeed, he was way here. But
[42:11] his his purpose is to get close to us
[42:15] &gt;&gt; as a true sons and daughter of God.
[42:17] Actually to the same God who put his
[42:20] nature, the divine nature into you.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; So that the worshipper and God himself
[42:25] have the same nature.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; The soul that is inside of you has the
[42:30] nature of God himself.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; It's not something else. Amen. You don't
[42:34] want to make yourself a son of God. You
[42:36] are son of God because of the gene of
[42:38] God inside of you before the foundation
[42:41] of the world. It says to be sons and
[42:43] daughters of God. God in heaven crying
[42:46] aba father my god and my god in my
[42:49] father's house. So you come from god you
[42:52] have the same you have the same nature
[42:54] of god. You are called unto adoption.
[42:57] You are not you are not you don't
[42:59] believe the message of the hour just to
[43:01] be just to be a nominal Christians. You
[43:04] are called unto adoption. You have a
[43:07] function you have to do. You have a
[43:09] purpose you have to do. You have to be
[43:11] after the father father's business.
[43:13] That's what the revelation of calling co
[43:15] of calling god your father. Calling god
[43:18] our father. Amen.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; Romans 8:15 says I will read a little of
[43:23] scriptures here. I don't I don't intend
[43:25] to take too long but just a few
[43:27] scriptures. Romans 8:15 says, "For we
[43:30] have not received the spirit of bondage
[43:33] again to fear, but we have received the
[43:36] spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, aba,
[43:39] father."
[43:40] &gt;&gt; We don't cry unto God by fear. So no
[43:45] Lord,
[43:47] I'm so afraid. I'm so scared. If this
[43:49] happen, if this happen, this happen. No,
[43:52] God, let thy will be done
[43:54] &gt;&gt; as it is in heaven. Let it be done on
[43:57] the same thing on earth. Your perfect
[43:59] will is always the best, Lord. I'm
[44:02] trusting in you. I'm relying on your
[44:04] grace. I'm trusting in your the word of
[44:06] God. It might take time, but father, I
[44:09] know that your will is always the
[44:11] perfect will. Is always the perfect
[44:14] thing for me. Amen. I don't want
[44:16] permissive will. I want your perfect
[44:18] will. Let your kingdom come. Let you
[44:22] yourself have the preminence. Lord, may
[44:24] you the one be dominating in my life. I
[44:26] want you to have the dominion upon my
[44:28] life. You have not received a spirit of
[44:30] fear, a spirit of trembling, a spirit of
[44:34] of of of being all the time afraid. No,
[44:37] God is saying you the fear no longer
[44:40] defines our standing with God. You don't
[44:43] serve God by fear of hell. You don't
[44:45] serve God by fear of punishment. No, you
[44:49] have to go a little bit further than
[44:50] that. It has to be the perfect love of
[44:52] God. It has to be the reality of God IN
[44:55] OUR HEART. AMEN. LET THAT BE OUR PRAYER.
[44:57] LORD, I want to serve you because I love
[44:59] you so much.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; Increase the love inside of my heart.
[45:03] Amen. Maybe we don't know Sunday. The
[45:06] love of God. The love is the most
[45:09] powerful most powerful virtue. I call it
[45:12] virtue that God can give you human
[45:14] because God is love himself.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; With love you can you can do anything if
[45:19] you love someone. You can do anything.
[45:21] If if just if brotherly kindness,
[45:24] brotherly love could bring a mother to
[45:27] go into fire to bring the baby. How much
[45:29] more our God with agapa love has
[45:32] expressed his love. HE CAME DOWN TO OUR
[45:35] PLACE. HE TOOK US FROM THE PLACE WHERE
[45:36] we were. He even BECAME SIN. NOT JUST
[45:39] BORE our sins, but he became sin IN
[45:42] ORDER TO TAKE us from that place. Amen.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; The love of God. Amen.
[45:47] If you have the love of God, let me tell
[45:50] you, you can conquer. Brother says, "How
[45:53] how do I cast those enemies? How do I
[45:55] cast the devils? Is it because of of
[45:58] strong words?" And no, it's because of
[46:00] the love of God inside of my heart.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; How can I conquer animals? Because I
[46:06] have the love of God inside of my heart.
[46:08] With love of God, you can you no one can
[46:11] hurt you and you can't hurt anybody.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:16] So we have not received a spirit of
[46:18] bondage again to fear but we have
[46:20] received a spirit of adoption whereby we
[46:22] cry aba father because we are not under
[46:27] slavery anymore.
[46:29] We are we are not prisoners anymore but
[46:32] we are sons and not only sons not only
[46:35] baby sons but sons of god called onto
[46:38] adoption become mature they know who
[46:41] they are they have that stability they
[46:44] are established in the truth. Amen.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; A sons of God who is adopted knows who
[46:49] he is. He knows that what belong to my
[46:52] father belongs to me as well. He takes
[46:54] care of the father's business. We and
[46:58] the father business that we have is the
[46:59] is the word of God for our time. YOU YOU
[47:01] YOU APPLY THE WORD OF GOD. YOU CARE
[47:04] ABOUT THE WORD OF GOD. LORD, I WANT THAT
[47:06] SPIRIT of adoption to be working IN MY
[47:08] LIFE. I DON'T WANT THE SPIRIT OF FEAR. I
[47:11] don't want the fear of spirit of
[47:12] bondage, but I want the spirit of the
[47:14] love of God in my heart.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; So, we approach God as father, not as a
[47:19] judge. We don't approach God as a judge.
[47:23] Though God is a judge, but he's a judge,
[47:25] but he's also our attorney. He's also
[47:28] our advocate. He's our mediator. Amen.
[47:32] The prophet will say then the case is
[47:34] settled.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; The case is SETTLED BECAUSE THE JUDGE
[47:37] AND THE ATTORNEY IS THE SAME PERSON.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; He comes as the word of God and says
[47:41] that because of what you have done by
[47:43] the the word of God, you are being
[47:45] condemned by the same God. Because you
[47:47] have said, "Lord, forgive me. The blood
[47:50] of Jesus Christ has wiped away your sins
[47:53] and you are declared sinless in the
[47:55] PRESENCE OF GOD. NOW HE'S DEFENDING YOU.
[47:58] SAY THAT my son, that my daughter.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; I like that expression. You cannot
[48:02] perish as God cannot perish. Amen.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Because you have the same spirit at work
[48:06] in you. Amen.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; First 2 Timothy 1:7 says, "For God has
[48:12] not given us the spirit of fear, but the
[48:15] spirit of power, the spirit of love, the
[48:18] spirit of a sound mind." We have
[48:21] received the spirit of power, the power
[48:23] of the Holy Ghost is still working in
[48:25] the church. God, give me more of your
[48:27] power. Give me more of the love of God.
[48:30] And let me have a sound mind. Not fear,
[48:34] but a sound mind. making the right
[48:37] decision with serenity, with peace,
[48:39] knowing that God is in control. Amen.
[48:42] Not going in a rush, not making a
[48:46] huh decisions in a in a in in harsh, but
[48:49] just believing in God word and taking it
[48:52] as his word. In other words, fear says,
[48:54] "I hope God accepts me or God God will
[48:57] receive me one day. I hope this. I hope
[49:00] this." No. The spirit of God INSIDE OF
[49:03] YOU BEAR witness to what the word of God
[49:05] says. The spirit inside of us bears
[49:08] witness that we are sons and daughters
[49:11] of God.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; How? Because the same spirit that was in
[49:14] Jesus Christ, the same spirit inside of
[49:16] us.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; Our Lord Jesus, how do you come? Our
[49:19] father which are in heaven. Heaven is
[49:22] just a dimension and heaven is now in
[49:25] our heart. Amen.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; How do you remove fear? You remove fear
[49:30] by the capstone, the perfect love. 1
[49:34] John 4:18 says, "There is no fear in
[49:36] love, but perfect love casteth all out
[49:39] fear because fear had torment. He that
[49:42] fear is not made perfect in love." So we
[49:45] thank God for the perfect love of God.
[49:48] Love cast out the fear.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; But I'm you know Job Job was fearing
[49:54] many things. Don't fear that this happen
[49:56] if this happen this happen. So fear is
[49:59] the worst enemy. It's the worst curse
[50:01] that can be upon the church is that fear
[50:04] &gt;&gt; that worries. So what is this? What
[50:07] about this? What about this? What about
[50:08] this? And you create your own negativity
[50:11] too much. But there is no negativity in
[50:13] the word of God.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Don't worry too much. Amen. That God I
[50:18] just put I I cast all my burden at your
[50:20] feet and I trust you. Leave it there and
[50:23] trust him. Amen. Just trust him because
[50:26] you are son and daughter of God.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; Instead of fear, believers receive the
[50:32] adoption, the spirit of adoption.
[50:35] Adoption in the Bible as the prophet
[50:37] would say is when you come to the full
[50:39] maturity is a place where you know that
[50:42] you are a son not of God. That what
[50:44] belongs to the father also belongs to
[50:46] you. Amen. It you have you have always
[50:49] been a son but there's a time where you
[50:51] realize that I am a son. Amen.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; That I am a daughter of God. You have
[50:56] always been there, but you have to come
[50:58] to the place where you realize who you
[51:00] are really are. When the bride recognize
[51:03] who she is, then the rapture will go.
[51:05] It's a matter of God. GIVE ME MORE
[51:07] revelation to know who I am, what I'm
[51:10] standing in the vision IN A BIG PLAN OF
[51:12] redemption and take all the fear away.
[51:14] Lord, give me more of your love
[51:17] &gt;&gt; rather than fear.
[51:21] That's why we cry with intimacy, aba
[51:24] father. Aba father. The prophet says as
[51:27] the eagles to up their nees, nothing
[51:29] will move you. On this I will build my
[51:31] church, says Jesus. And the gates of
[51:33] hell can't prevail against it. Nothing
[51:35] will never move it. It the unmovable
[51:38] rock of God's eternal word. Right in the
[51:41] hours of death, even when all hope is
[51:43] gone, a born child of God can take his
[51:46] stand on God's eternal word and look
[51:48] yonder beyond these tears and say to
[51:51] look to him and said, "I am the
[51:53] resurrection and life." Even death is
[51:56] itself will never shake them. They are
[51:58] eagles. They're heavenborn birds. Their
[52:01] nature in them is designed to believe
[52:03] that and to trust it.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Galatians 4:6 says, "And
[52:08] because you are sons, God has sent forth
[52:11] the spirit of his son onto your hearts
[52:13] crying, aba father." As we cry, we as we
[52:17] come and pray, this crying doesn't mean
[52:19] that you are crying and crying, but it
[52:21] means you you are yearning and coming to
[52:23] the Lord, you are my father, I trust in
[52:26] you. You are my father. There is a
[52:28] relationship between you and me. I'm not
[52:31] just a religious person. And if I am
[52:33] Lord change me from the the churchity to
[52:36] have a relationship of love with you
[52:38] Lord that I recognize my position the
[52:41] family of God. I am your son. I am your
[52:44] daughter. Take away the fear of
[52:45] punishment. Take away the fear of
[52:47] rejection. Take away the fear of
[52:49] condemnation. I even if you have
[52:52] repented of your sins that fear of
[52:54] condemnation should not be there
[52:55] anymore. You should come and take part
[52:58] in the promise of God. Why sometimes we
[53:01] don't get the benefit? Why we don't get
[53:03] the benefit of redempt of what the
[53:05] redemption have have brought to us on
[53:07] Calvary? Because we are constantly under
[53:10] the spirit of fear, under the spirit of
[53:13] condemnation, under the fear of guilt.
[53:16] Even though sometimes we have confessed
[53:17] our sin, but the enemy comes and reminds
[53:20] us and then we we we tend to agree with
[53:22] what the enemy is saying. SATAN IS
[53:24] ALWAYS A LIAR. AMEN. BUT YOU STAND UPON
[53:27] THE WORD OF GOD. I have already
[53:28] confessed. Amen. And and I'm standing
[53:31] AND I'M MOVING ON. PROPHET SAYS WE DIE
[53:33] DAILY. AMEN. WE DIE DAILY. We vaccinate
[53:36] daily. But there is something keeps
[53:39] holding you. SOMETHING KEEP PUSHING YOU.
[53:41] WHAT'S THAT? THE SPIRIT OF GOD. SPIRIT
[53:43] OF POWER. SPIRIT OF LOVE.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; AND A SOUND MIND. THANK GOD.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Now Luke 17:21. Neither shall they say
[53:59] lo here lo there lo behold the kingdom
[54:02] of god is within you. So it looks like a
[54:05] little bit how do you say how do you say
[54:08] oh god let the kingdom come and then god
[54:10] says the kingdom of god is within you.
[54:14] I believe as I said on Sunday, I believe
[54:17] what you have received that little stone
[54:19] of revelation that you have received in
[54:21] your heart, it has to grow. It has to
[54:24] become it has to become the one that is
[54:27] dominating our heart, our lives. Not not
[54:30] walking by sight, not walking by our
[54:32] feelings, but walking with faith. Amen.
[54:36] That faith has to increase. That
[54:38] reality, the Holy Spirit even inside of
[54:41] us has to increase, has to grow. It has
[54:44] to grow and we has to come down. We have
[54:46] to die more and let the Holy Spirit take
[54:48] full dominion, full control over our
[54:50] lives. Lord, Father, give me more of the
[54:53] Holy Spirit. Give me more of the
[54:55] revelation. Make me more sincere. Help
[54:57] me to die to myself that Christ have the
[55:00] full dominion upon my life.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; And if there is any need, if there is
[55:04] any need, and we have a lot of needs. We
[55:07] are coming to God with full confidence.
[55:09] Lord, I'm not coming with a with a
[55:11] slavery mentality, with a beggar
[55:14] mentality. No, like prophet says, like
[55:17] that little fish in the middle of the
[55:19] ocean. I I can't ask too much because I
[55:22] don't know if he's able to provide to
[55:24] this. I'm I'm scared. BUT NO, GOD IS
[55:27] MORE THAN ABLE TO PROVIDE TO ALL OUR
[55:29] NEED. THERE'S NOTHING IMPOSSIBLE to
[55:32] whoever believes. AMEN.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; YOU JUST ACCEPT THE WORD OF GOD. GOD, I
[55:36] TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD. OTHERS MIGHT NOT
[55:38] HAVE THE SAME REVELATION BUT YOU KEEP
[55:40] PRESSING ON LIKE THAT WOMAN WITH THE
[55:42] BLOOD ISSUE NEVER DONE IN THE PAST BUT
[55:45] SAYS IF I TOUCH THAT THE HEM OF HIS
[55:47] GARMENT I KNOW I'M GOING TO BE HEALED.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SHE HAD A PERSONAL REVELATION AND
[55:52] SHE COMES AND SHE TOUCH AND SOMETHING
[55:54] HAPPENED.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; GOD THANK YOU LORD BECAUSE YOU ARE STILL
[55:57] THE SAME GOD TODAY. THE SAME HIGH PRIEST
[55:59] WHO CAN BE TOUCHED BY THE FEELING OF OUR
[56:01] INFIRMITIES. HE IS OUR FATHER. HE IS OUR
[56:05] FATHER. IF THE NATURAL FATHER DOESN'T
[56:07] WANT HIS CHILDREN to be hurting, if he
[56:09] has the means to provide to the TO THEIR
[56:11] NEEDS, HOW MUCH MORE OUR HEAVENLY father
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Proverb says, look away to Jesus. The
[56:26] Messiah is the word.
[56:28] The word. And the Bible says in Hebrews
[56:30] 4th chapter say the word of God is
[56:32] quicker more powerful than a two-edged
[56:35] sword getting even a sound the born of a
[56:39] discern of the thought that in the heart
[56:41] and when she know that Messiah was he
[56:43] was was to be that word made manifest
[56:46] and could tell her what was wrong with
[56:48] her that woman at the well she know that
[56:51] was Messiah. If she knew that there was
[56:54] Messiah today we know that the word we
[56:56] have received is also the Messiah. If
[56:58] he's a messiah, it means he has a
[56:59] kingdom and we are part of that kingdom.
[57:02] Amen. In type, Israel possess the
[57:04] kingdom, the kingdom of the the land by
[57:07] conquering a small by small steps. But
[57:10] God was with them. Amen. The same as
[57:13] with today. We want to claim our
[57:15] inheritance. We got to claim what we we
[57:18] if if if God drops in your heart a
[57:20] revelation for healing, a revelation for
[57:22] your children, a revelation for for for
[57:25] job, a revelation for for for a deeper,
[57:28] a closer walk with God. Whatever is in
[57:31] the need, God drops a revelation your
[57:32] heart. Let me tell you, continue
[57:34] claiming that. Continue fighting for it.
[57:37] Lord, this is my inheritance. I am a son
[57:40] AND DAUGHTER OF GOD. THIS MY
[57:42] INHERITANCE. I'M NOT GOING to let the
[57:44] devil take it away from me. Amen.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; Prophet says Christ the mystery of God.
[57:57] First to express the three-fold purpose.
[57:59] First to express himself completely God
[58:02] in Christ. Second to have the
[58:03] preeminences by this in his church which
[58:06] is his body the bride till till he could
[58:09] have the preeminence to express himself
[58:11] through them. It's the time we are
[58:13] living in. And thirdly, to restore the
[58:15] kingdom to its rightfully position.
[58:18] Rightly position that fell by sin by the
[58:21] first Adam back to where he walke off in
[58:23] the cool of the evening with his people,
[58:26] talked with them and fellowshipped with
[58:28] them. And we are looking forward s we're
[58:31] looking forward to that time where the
[58:33] the kingdom of God will fully be
[58:35] restored in the physical and the
[58:37] spiritual fully restored. But today that
[58:39] kingdom is being restored in our soul.
[58:41] Amen. and say the kingdom is already in
[58:43] your heart and we want that kingdom to
[58:45] be fully restored completely in our
[58:48] heart where we have a personal and
[58:50] direct fellowship with God direct
[58:53] connection with our father seed gene of
[58:56] God only the prophet could tell that we
[58:58] are we are the seed gene of God MEANS WE
[59:01] ARE PART OF GOD HIMSELF WE ARE NOT
[59:04] different from from God if we're not
[59:06] separated from God we are
[59:09] &gt;&gt; THE SE GENE OF GOD AMEN AMEN.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; AS WE WERE IN HIM, WE WERE THE THOUGHT
[59:13] OF GOD NOW BEING EXPRESSED. THE GENE
[59:16] THAT WAS IN GOD NOW being expressed.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Now we come to God with that faith, with
[59:22] that revelation. Lord, I'm bringing my
[59:25] family to you because you are my father,
[59:30] &gt;&gt; my heavenly father.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Lord, I have this problem in this body,
[59:34] BUT YOU ARE MY FATHER. YOU ARE the one
[59:39] who loves me more than anything else.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; We are living in a time of full
[59:48] inheritance. The full manifestation of
[59:50] sons and daughters of God, not partial
[59:53] manifestation, full manifestations.
[59:56] So that what we are the age we are
[59:58] living in. Why? We we are living in a
[1:00:01] king. The kingdom is being restored. And
[1:00:03] we have as as Abraham met the king, you
[1:00:06] know, Abraham met mec
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; the king of Salem. He met me, king of
[1:00:12] Salam. The prophet said now he has been
[1:00:14] looking for that kingdom, for that city
[1:00:17] where the maker and the builder is God
[1:00:18] himself because he met me. He knows that
[1:00:22] that city exists. Can't have a king of a
[1:00:24] city without without having. So he's
[1:00:27] looking for that king. But now the
[1:00:29] prophet come says and preaching who is
[1:00:31] this mech? No. Who was that meedc? Who
[1:00:34] he is this Melkisedc? So now we can meet
[1:00:37] THE SAME MELKISEDC TOO. AND WE HAVE met
[1:00:39] the Melkisedc. And that's why WE ARE
[1:00:41] LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT CITY TOO. AMEN.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; AND GOD gave him in his inheritance. He
[1:00:46] gave him a portion of that kingdom. But
[1:00:48] now today the mercy THAT THEY COME BACK
[1:00:51] SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THE FULL KINGDOM OF
[1:00:53] GOD BEING RESTORED. NOW
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR LIVING IN THIS LAST AGE.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; MOSES WOULD HAVE LOVED TO BE LIVE IN
[1:01:00] THIS EARTH. ABRAHAM WOULD HAVE LOVED TO
[1:01:02] BE LIVING IN THIS AGE. JOHN THE BAPTIST
[1:01:04] WOULD HAVE LOVED TO BE LIVING IN THIS
[1:01:06] AGE. BUT YOU AND I, WE ARE LIVING IN THE
[1:01:08] MOST GLORIOUS AGES OF all the ages.
[1:01:11] Amen.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHERE GOD NOW NOT IN THE
[1:01:14] DISPENSATION OF THE FATHER, not in the
[1:01:16] dispensation of the son, but God in the
[1:01:18] dispensation of the HOLY GHOST USING
[1:01:20] YOUR BODY, USING YOUR MIND, USING YOUR
[1:01:24] PECULARITY, MY PECULARITY TO EXPRESS
[1:01:27] HIMSELF.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; GOD IS OUR FATHER. AMEN.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; LORD, let your kingdom come
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; in our soul, in our mind, in our being,
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; just living as citizen of that kingdom,
[1:01:39] having control what was done. Moses saw
[1:01:42] the plan of God in heaven.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; And God agreed with what he was doing
[1:01:47] because what he saw in heaven has been
[1:01:49] duplicated on earth. AMEN.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; GOD LOVED THE offering of Abel because
[1:01:54] it was representing the lamb of God was
[1:01:56] slain before the foundation of the
[1:01:58] world. What was done in heaven now has
[1:02:00] been duplicated on earth. Amen.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; We God approved the temple of Solomon
[1:02:05] because it was a part according to a
[1:02:07] pattern OF HEAVEN. NOW GOD WANTS
[1:02:10] EVERYTHING THAT HAVE BEEN NOW OUR PRAYER
[1:02:12] IS THE SAME THING. GOD WE DON'T WANT OUR
[1:02:15] own pattern. We don't want our own will.
[1:02:17] We want WHAT IS DONE IN HEAVEN. WHAT HAS
[1:02:19] BEEN FOR AND PREDESTINATED BEFORE THE
[1:02:22] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. WE WANT THAT TO
[1:02:24] BE FULFILLED IN OUR LIVES. AMEN. NOT A
[1:02:26] PERMISSIVE WILL BUT YOUR PERFECT WILL
[1:02:29] LORD FOR YOUR GLORY LORD MAKE ME JUST
[1:02:32] AVAILABLE TO FULFILL YOUR WORD LORD KEEP
[1:02:35] ME IN THE CHANNEL OF THE WORD OF GOD
[1:02:37] KEEP ME IN THE CHANNEL OF THE PLAN OF
[1:02:39] REDEMPTION. AMEN.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Proverb says we have he received you
[1:02:52] know the story he received.
[1:02:55] I'm almost there. He received the sword
[1:02:58] of of of of the king. He says it fit my
[1:03:01] hand so perfectly.
[1:03:03] That sword of the king says no. Uh it's
[1:03:07] not it's not it's not a sword of a king.
[1:03:11] It's the sword of the king.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; The king of kings, the lord of lords.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; And that sword he gave it to the
[1:03:20] prophet. Amen.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, it did not stop only
[1:03:23] with the prophet. The prophet got that
[1:03:25] and he gave that to us. Amen. We can use
[1:03:28] the same sword of the king of kings to
[1:03:31] cut the unbelief, to cut sickness, to
[1:03:34] remove negativity. WE WE HAVE THE SAME
[1:03:37] SWORD OF THE WORD OF GOD TO CUT
[1:03:40] ANYTHING. AMEN. THE BIBLE SAID USE THAT
[1:03:42] SWORD TO CUT THE PROMISE OF GOD BELONGS
[1:03:45] TO YOU. AMEN.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR THE SWORD OF THE WORD OF
[1:03:48] GOD. NOT A CERTAIN KING BUT THE KING OF
[1:03:51] KING HAS GIVEN US THE SWORD FOR OUR
[1:03:53] DEFENSE FOR OUR DEFENSE IN THIS AGE OF
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; LAIA.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; MOTHERS YOU CAN USE THE SWORD. AMEN.
[1:04:01] FATHERS YOU CAN USE THE SWORD. YOUNG
[1:04:03] CHILDREN YOU CAN USE THE SWORD OF THE
[1:04:05] WORD OF GOD.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; IT IS WRITTEN. It is written. It is
[1:04:09] written. YOU CAN DEFEAT SATAN ANYTIME,
[1:04:13] ANY PLACE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BY THE
[1:04:16] WORD OF GOD.
[1:04:17] SPEAK THE WORD OF GOD. AMEN.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; AND MOVE ON.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Glory to his name.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Says in the message Christ the mystery
[1:04:33] of God says our headship is the kingdom.
[1:04:38] The kingdom of God is within you. Say
[1:04:40] the Bible Jesus the kingdom. We are not
[1:04:43] a denomination. We belong to a kingdom.
[1:04:46] And the kingdom is the word of God made
[1:04:49] spirit and life in our own life,
[1:04:52] bringing to pass every promise in this
[1:04:54] day as it did in that day when the word
[1:04:57] and God was one. And the word and God is
[1:05:00] one in his church today, making it the
[1:05:03] headship of the body that is redeemed to
[1:05:07] bring the message in the last day and be
[1:05:10] taken up from the dead in the
[1:05:11] resurrection to go back and restore
[1:05:14] again as Adam and Eve in the beginning
[1:05:17] in the garden of Eden the three-fold
[1:05:20] mystery of God, his body and the
[1:05:23] prophecies. Oh my. Oh, let me just put a
[1:05:27] comment here. The healing might be just
[1:05:30] you read in the in the word of God says,
[1:05:32] "Oh, by your stripes I'm healed." And it
[1:05:35] is written here. But now we want what is
[1:05:39] written here to become a revelation in
[1:05:41] the heart. Say, "Lord, I now want the
[1:05:44] word of God, as you say, the kingdom is
[1:05:46] the word of God made spirit and life in
[1:05:49] his own life." Yeah, it is the word of
[1:05:51] God. But I want this word of God to
[1:05:53] become life inside of me. To become
[1:05:56] reality inside of me. Let the word of
[1:05:58] God made the spirit and life inside of
[1:06:00] me. Let thy kingdom come. Now, Lord, let
[1:06:04] the word of God become reality inside of
[1:06:06] me. Father, spiritually speaking says,
[1:06:09] now if this my comment, if you are still
[1:06:12] bound to sin, the word says you are
[1:06:14] free. As long as it stays in letter
[1:06:16] form, it is not yet your kingdom. But
[1:06:18] God wants it to become your kingdom. He
[1:06:21] wants it to become your property. He
[1:06:23] want to become your place of your
[1:06:24] domain. Becomes part of you. The promise
[1:06:27] of salvation of our kids is part of the
[1:06:29] kingdom. The promise to be free from
[1:06:31] depression, from anxiety, to live a
[1:06:33] clean sanctified life. Is part of the
[1:06:36] promise of inheritance. It is our
[1:06:38] kingdom. Satan Satan Satan cannot be in
[1:06:41] our kingdom. The kingdom of God is
[1:06:44] peace, joy, victory, glory to God. As
[1:06:48] the Bible says 1 Corinthians 4:20, for
[1:06:51] the kingdom of God is not in word but in
[1:06:53] power. Amen. How many wants the power of
[1:06:55] God in our life?
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want more of your power in my
[1:06:59] life.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; That's what I desire. Father,
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; grant it. Amen.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Musicians in Father Peter took a
[1:07:08] steal 10 minutes out of my time, but
[1:07:11] sweep over my soul. Sweep over
[1:07:15] my soul.
[1:07:18] Sweep over
[1:07:21] my soul.
[1:07:25] Sweet spirit.
[1:07:27] Sweep over
[1:07:30] my soul.
[1:07:34] My wrath
[1:07:37] is complete.
[1:07:41] My
[1:07:42] seat at your feet
[1:07:47] spirit
[1:07:49] sweep over
[1:07:52] my soul.

[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; I want to thank God for daily protection
[1:15:14] of my family.
[1:15:16] Sometimes in our neighborhood we hear
[1:15:18] things or we read things that's
[1:15:20] happening like some people stealing
[1:15:22] things and sometimes my children forget
[1:15:24] to lock the doors and then we wake up in
[1:15:26] the morning the door is not locked but
[1:15:28] we thank God for protection keeps us
[1:15:30] safe and I also want to request that uh
[1:15:33] we can pray for my family back home.
[1:15:35] Nobody is safe. It's only me. So if we
[1:15:38] can get my brothers and my sisters and
[1:15:40] my nephews and my nieces to see God.
[1:15:44] Amen. Amen.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; I just just want to thank God for his
[1:15:53] love, mercy, and grace in my life, for
[1:15:55] my wife and children uh for watching
[1:15:58] over this past year of 2025.
[1:16:01] It's been a very challenging year,
[1:16:03] especially for my wife. She's had to go
[1:16:07] through some serious health issues and
[1:16:10] but through it all, God's been there.
[1:16:12] I've been trying to encourage her that,
[1:16:14] you know, that the doctors can do what
[1:16:16] they can do and you know, they can use
[1:16:18] the medicine, but it takes a great
[1:16:20] physician to come on the scene and to
[1:16:22] touch her body. And I believe God has
[1:16:24] already done that. Um, and she's doing
[1:16:27] well. Um, and for my children also, of
[1:16:30] course, everybody knows my situation all
[1:16:33] too well. and I'm seeing a change in our
[1:16:37] uh our Candace and uh I think God is
[1:16:40] working behind the scenes and uh you
[1:16:44] know and it's the little things that you
[1:16:47] know you pick up on. It's it's not the
[1:16:49] big things so much. it's, you know, you
[1:16:51] know, the makeup's gone, you know, and
[1:16:53] she's hasn't cut her hair for a long
[1:16:55] time.
[1:16:55] And I think that to me that's a sign
[1:16:57] that God's working on her
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; and she's uh I see she's starting to
[1:17:02] wear, you know, the skirts again a
[1:17:04] little bit once in a while and she's got
[1:17:06] but you know it's all part of the
[1:17:07] process and it's all because you know
[1:17:09] sisters out there loving her you know
[1:17:12] inviting her out and people that are
[1:17:13] praying this it's so important
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; correct
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; that we as a body of Christ
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; absolutely
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; can love one another with no strings
[1:17:21] attached and just say God bless you. God
[1:17:24] bless you. We're praying for you. They
[1:17:26] know that.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Correct.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; That's what's going to win them back.
[1:17:28] That's what wins anybody back is prayer,
[1:17:31] love. Correct.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; And I just pray that we could all pull
[1:17:33] together tonight in prayer for our loved
[1:17:35] ones, for our friends, for our maybe for
[1:17:38] it's for a worker or whatever it is.
[1:17:39] Somebody that out there that needs
[1:17:41] Christ, but doesn't know how to reach
[1:17:43] out. Somebody reached out to me 35 years
[1:17:46] ago.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Correct.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; And they prayed for me. And now it's my
[1:17:50] turn to pray for that one person maybe
[1:17:52] that's out there, whoever it may be. God
[1:17:54] bless you. Thank you very much.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
