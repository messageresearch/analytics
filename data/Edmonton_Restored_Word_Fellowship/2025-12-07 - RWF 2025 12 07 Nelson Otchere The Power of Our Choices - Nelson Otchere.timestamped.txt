[27:40] &gt;&gt; My prayer, my [singing]
[27:42] higher
[27:43] ground,
[27:44] &gt;&gt; oh my Lord, [singing]
[27:46] &gt;&gt; lift me up.
[27:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, lift me up and let me stand [music]
[27:52] by faith on
[27:56] stable land.
[27:59] a higher place
[28:02] that I have [singing] found.
[28:06] Lord, plant my feet [music] on higher
[28:10] ground
[28:16] of the world.
[28:19] Satan's [singing and music]
[28:23] all heard
[28:32] the song [music and singing] of saints
[28:34] on higher
[28:36] ground
[28:45] by faith.
[28:55] that I have found.
[28:59] Lord, plant my feet on higher
[29:03] ground.
[30:10] There's no bondage in the house of the
[30:11] Lord.
[30:13] is always freedom and libert and
[30:14] happiness. God rich bless you all.
[30:18] God bless you.
[30:55] because he lives.
[31:00] I can face
[31:03] him more very slowly and prayerfully
[31:08] because Christ lives.
[31:13] All fear is
[31:20] because I know.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:33] Oh,
[31:35] and life is worth the living
[31:40] [music and singing] just because
[31:44] he
[31:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, because he lives.
[31:52] Oh,
[31:56] I can face
[31:58] tomorrow.
[32:04] God
[32:06] because my goal is [music] of
[32:15] God because
[32:18] I know
[32:20] yes I know
[32:23] he holds my future
[32:30] and life
[32:33] Oh living
[32:37] be
[32:39] in
[32:42] shall bow our heads for a word of
[32:43] prayer.
[32:45] Our gracious heavenly father.
[32:49] Your sons are gathered. Your sons and
[32:51] daughters are gathered before your
[32:53] presence this morning.
[32:57] Father Lord Jesus. The reason why we are
[32:59] gathered this morning is for a purpose.
[33:03] and the purpose is what you know
[33:06] and I pray the father may your will be
[33:08] done upon our lives.
[33:11] May we put our will aside
[33:14] and your will take total absolute
[33:17] control.
[33:19] Thank you for the pastor of the church.
[33:22] Thank you for the church officers.
[33:24] Thank you for the instrumentalist.
[33:27] And thank you for each and every member
[33:29] in this house this hour.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; And if there be that the
[33:34] service is also being streamed, we also
[33:37] commit all those
[33:40] watching via live streaming. May every
[33:42] loving presence be with each one of us.
[33:45] Bless your word.
[33:48] speak to each and every heart that at
[33:50] the end of the service we shall give you
[33:52] all the praise and all the glory
[33:54] for we ask all this in Jesus Christ we
[33:56] pray with all thanksgiving. Amen.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; You know there's one thing I always love
[34:08] the house of the Lord. There's liberty.
[34:11] Amen.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; I've never ever seen any place that is
[34:14] so sweet and so comfortable than the
[34:16] house of the Lord.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; And the house of the Lord is the only
[34:19] place where you come in, you put your
[34:21] trouble there, you leave there very
[34:22] empty.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; You know out there there's so much of a
[34:25] burden.
[34:27] Our daily life is filled with burdens
[34:29] and trials.
[34:31] Our lives the step you even take are
[34:33] very heavy.
[34:35] Your minds are filled with worry.
[34:38] You're filled with a lot of things.
[34:41] thinking of what you eat in the morning,
[34:43] thinking of what the children is going
[34:44] to wear, thinking of what you're going
[34:46] to wear, thinking of how you're going to
[34:49] get to work, thinking of the lovely
[34:51] weather,
[34:53] thinking of everything. But when you
[34:55] come to the house of the Lord, you drop
[34:58] everything
[34:59] &gt;&gt; at the feet of the mighty God and he
[35:01] will take care of the rest.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; And I always love being in the house of
[35:05] the Lord. That's why David said, "I was
[35:07] glad when they said unto me, let us go
[35:08] to the house of the Lord."
[35:10] &gt;&gt; He didn't say that for fun. He said for
[35:12] a purpose.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; And I want you to know that you being
[35:14] here is not by an accident. It's not by
[35:17] chance. It's by the will and the grace
[35:19] of the mighty God.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Once again, as pastor
[35:24] said, my name is Nelson.
[35:27] That's my full name.
[35:30] Here is my wonderful brother and friend.
[35:33] We grew all the way from Nigeria so
[35:36] young
[35:37] through Sunday school God has brought us
[35:40] this far and we thank God for the life
[35:42] God has given to us and I also want to
[35:45] really appreciate him for the good work
[35:47] he's doing
[35:49] when I was coming over I said don't
[35:51] worry I'll talk to
[35:57] the will of the Lord be done and this
[36:00] morning I am here with my precious
[36:02] brother Daniel as well and I want to
[36:04] pastor for giving us the privilege to
[36:07] stand before you and share what we have.
[36:10] You know it's very difficult for a
[36:11] pastor to give his to you. You know the
[36:14] reason why there are a lot of falsehoods
[36:16] going around. So of that you want to put
[36:20] that barricade around the pulpit and be
[36:22] very careful for the kind of spirit that
[36:25] doesn't come in and destroy the church
[36:26] or dabilize the church.
[36:28] And I want to thank the pastor to bless
[36:30] you for giving us this opportunity and I
[36:34] pray that the almighty God would bless
[36:36] each and every one of us this morning.
[36:40] It shouldn't be my words and it's not my
[36:41] words because I have nothing to give. I
[36:44] can't even put down together the ABCs.
[36:46] Almighty God knows how to put down
[36:47] everything in our lives. So without much
[36:50] ado, why don't you stand to your feet
[36:53] and stand with me to the book of Joshua
[36:55] chapter 24.
[36:58] We are reading from two places from the
[37:01] scripture this morning.
[37:05] I'm trusting almighty God to be brief.
[37:09] I don't know how many gi
[37:16] God give to us will be a blessing to
[37:18] each and every of you.
[37:20] We're going to read from the 15th verse
[37:24] of the 24th chapter of the book of
[37:27] Joshua.
[37:30] Joshua
[37:32] chapter 24 and verse 15.
[37:38] I wouldn't rush. I'll take it slowly so
[37:41] that we all can be part of it.
[37:45] I read and it says, "And if it seem evil
[37:51] unto you to serve the Lord,
[37:55] choose you this day whom you serve,
[38:02] whether the gods which your father
[38:04] served that were on the other side of
[38:07] the flood,
[38:10] or the gods of the Amorites,
[38:13] in whose land you dwell.
[38:16] But as for me,
[38:20] &gt;&gt; will you say the same thing?
[38:23] &gt;&gt; Say that. As for me,
[38:25] &gt;&gt; for me
[38:26] &gt;&gt; and my house
[38:27] &gt;&gt; and my house,
[38:29] &gt;&gt; we will serve the Lord.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; Is that your prayer this morning?
[38:34] &gt;&gt; Is that your prayer this morning?
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Let's say that said, but as for me,
[38:40] &gt;&gt; as for me,
[38:41] &gt;&gt; just say it after me. But as for me,
[38:43] &gt;&gt; But as for me,
[38:45] &gt;&gt; and my household,
[38:47] &gt;&gt; and my household,
[38:48] &gt;&gt; we will serve the Lord.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; We will serve the Lord.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, there's no other God we can serve.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; There's no other God.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; Turn with me again to the book of
[38:59] Deuteronomy chapter 30.
[39:02] Deuteronomy 30
[39:06] and we're reading the 19th verse.
[39:21] Deuteronomy 30 and verse 19.
[39:27] I call heaven and earth to recall this
[39:29] day against you
[39:32] that I have set before you life and
[39:37] death.
[39:39] I said I'm taking very seriously. Just
[39:40] pay attention please.
[39:43] I have called heaven and earth to record
[39:46] this day
[39:48] against each and every one of us in here
[39:50] this morning
[39:53] that I have set before you life and
[39:58] death
[40:01] blessing and cursing.
[40:05] Therefore, choose life.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible is saying.
[40:10] Therefore, choose life
[40:13] that both thou and thy seed,
[40:18] I'm changing that seed to the house,
[40:20] just as we read in the book of Joshua,
[40:22] that both you and your household may do
[40:27] what?
[40:29] May the Lord add his rich blessings to
[40:31] the words. Amen.
[40:34] Rich bless you
[40:38] this morning. As I said, I'm trusting
[40:39] Almighty God to help us. We just want to
[40:41] take for a thought the power of our
[40:44] choices.
[40:49] The power of our choices.
[40:52] The prophet makes us know that we are
[40:55] all free moral agency on this earth.
[40:59] We have the right to make choices.
[41:03] And before I go on, I want to say this.
[41:06] Everything that is related to our life,
[41:10] every question that you have got,
[41:14] everything that is troubling you,
[41:17] God has given us the answers
[41:20] in the scriptures as well as the end
[41:23] time message.
[41:25] And that is why the prophet came in to
[41:28] set in order
[41:30] anything
[41:32] that would bring doubt,
[41:35] anything that will be discrepancies.
[41:38] Anything that will be confusion no
[41:40] brothers
[41:42] as long as you get a revelation of God's
[41:44] word
[41:46] you at peace.
[41:50] If you want to find fault in the word of
[41:51] God you will find it.
[41:54] If you want to find negativity in the
[41:56] word of God you will surely find it. But
[41:59] look in everything you need to do just
[42:02] put it before God and he God his spirit
[42:06] will direct you to its perfection.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; So this morning it's not my words. We
[42:13] have everything pertaining to the
[42:14] thought we're going to share and we're
[42:16] going to read it as we move ahead. And
[42:19] now let's move back. The power of our
[42:22] choices. This morning you had a choice
[42:25] to be in the house of God.
[42:27] You also had you also had a choice to be
[42:29] in your house and sleep and even make an
[42:32] excuse that the weather is so cold
[42:34] [laughter]
[42:36] and put on the heater and sleep.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; But he said, "I will go to the house of
[42:41] the Lord." Why did you come to the house
[42:42] of the Lord this morning?
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Brothers, you didn't come here so that
[42:45] you can see me.
[42:47] You didn't come here to see the pastor.
[42:50] You didn't come here to see your brother
[42:51] or your sister. You came here to meet
[42:54] the Almighty God. Hallelujah.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; And look, the almighty God is already
[42:58] here. For he said in his word, that for
[42:59] where two or three are gathered,
[43:02] &gt;&gt; I am in their midst.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; So he God is already here. So you are
[43:06] here to meet him
[43:08] &gt;&gt; so IF THERE'S ANYTHING TROUBLING YOU,
[43:11] channel everything to his feet
[43:14] &gt;&gt; and he will surely answer it and do it
[43:15] according to his which is in glory.
[43:18] There are two sources of power.
[43:22] We have the power of God
[43:25] and we have the power of the enemy.
[43:31] Now the power of Gods
[43:34] down to the book of Genesis. Turn with
[43:37] me to the book of Genesis chapter 2.
[43:38] Let's read verse 17. [snorts]
[43:41] Genesis chapter 2
[43:44] and verse 17.
[43:51] And what does it say? Genesis 2 and
[43:54] verse 17.
[44:01] It says, "But of the tree
[44:05] of the knowledge of good and evil,
[44:09] thou shalt not eat
[44:13] of it.
[44:16] For in the day that thou eatest thereof,
[44:20] thou shalt surely die.
[44:24] So which means from the scriptures we
[44:26] just read, there were two trees in the
[44:30] garden of Eden.
[44:33] And the two trees are this. There is
[44:35] one, the tree of life, and there's
[44:38] another one, the tree of knowledge of
[44:39] good and evil.
[44:41] Let's read something here from the
[44:42] prophet. It says in the garden of Aan
[44:46] verse two trees
[44:49] one was knowledge and one was faith.
[44:55] One was life
[44:58] one was death of knowledge.
[45:01] Other was life by faith.
[45:05] And as long as they eat by faith of this
[45:09] tree
[45:11] they lived.
[45:14] But when he got on this tree,
[45:17] he died.
[45:21] It says we start with the fact that
[45:24] there are two trees in the midst of the
[45:26] garden.
[45:28] The tree of life was Jesus.
[45:34] The other tree is definitely Satan
[45:38] because of what came forth of the tree.
[45:43] Because of what came forth of the fruit
[45:46] of the tree,
[45:50] this what the prophet is saying here,
[45:54] we have two choices to make. And that's
[45:57] what happened in the garden of Eden. And
[45:59] the book of Romans chapter 6 and verse
[46:01] 23 says, "For the wages of sin is
[46:03] death."
[46:05] Let me see if I can see. For the wages
[46:06] of sin is death, but the gift of God is
[46:09] eternal through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[46:13] You can put it down. That's the book of
[46:15] Romans chapter 6 and verse 23. Now in
[46:18] the garden of heaven, God's children
[46:20] have the choice to make.
[46:23] And that is where we are this morning.
[46:25] We are I want to turn this into the
[46:27] garden of heaven. We have a choice to
[46:29] make this morning. What is your choice?
[46:32] I don't know the kind of choice you want
[46:33] to make.
[46:35] But he that believeth in him has
[46:39] something.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; And in the book of Mark 16:6, it says
[46:43] that he that believeth and is baptized
[46:46] shall be saved.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; But he that believeth not shall be what?
[46:52] Damned.
[46:54] I'm not the one saying it.
[46:57] is the scriptures
[47:00] from the book of Joseph. I said, "Choose
[47:02] you this day."
[47:06] There was a very nice, lovely young man
[47:08] in the Bible, the rich young ruler.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; He saw the master and he realized within
[47:14] himself that there was something missing
[47:16] on the inside of him. Church, as you're
[47:19] sitting down here, if there's something
[47:21] missing in you, you know it.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; But don't let time leave or don't let
[47:28] him go and sit down and said I will do
[47:31] it today or I'll do it tomorrow. Time
[47:34] might not be there for you.
[47:37] Make your choice and make your decision
[47:39] today.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; MAKE YOUR STEP THIS VERY HOUR.
[47:44] Where am I going to?
[47:48] This rich young realized that there was
[47:50] something missing in him. He had
[47:52] everything. All the riches on earth, he
[47:54] had it.
[47:58] And when he saw the master, he realized
[47:59] that there was something. He went over
[48:00] to him. He said, "Master,
[48:02] what may I do that I may inherit what?
[48:05] Eternal life."
[48:09] Listen. He said, "Go over. Do you know
[48:12] whatsoever is in the scriptures? You
[48:13] know the ten commandments. Look at what
[48:15] he said." He said, "I have done all
[48:17] those things from what?"
[48:20] Church, I want to throw this challenge
[48:23] to you, pastor. Please get the key doors
[48:26] ready. If anybody answers us the same
[48:29] thing, we'll close the service and go
[48:30] home.
[48:33] Who amongst us can say the same thing as
[48:36] that rich young ruler?
[48:39] Who
[48:42] service continues?
[48:47] Nobody.
[48:49] HE SAID I HAVE [screaming] DONE
[48:50] EVERYTHING FOR MY YOUTH.
[48:55] But you and I, we are we are culprits of
[48:58] it.
[49:00] BUT HE THAT HAS DONE ALL THIS STILL LACK
[49:04] SOMETHING. HOW MUCH MORE YOU AND I THAT
[49:06] DO THIS MISTAKE EVERY DAY OF OUR life
[49:09] &gt;&gt; that we act as if we are so righteous.
[49:17] He said, "Master, I have done all this,
[49:20] all the commandments, thou shall not
[49:21] steal. I have done it. Thou shall not
[49:24] lie. Oh, I've never lied in my life.
[49:27] Thou [snorts] have done this. I have
[49:28] done all everything." The master said,
[49:32] "But you lack one thing." He said, "Yes,
[49:34] that's why I've come before you, church.
[49:37] You and I have a choice to make this
[49:38] morning or this afternoon.
[49:41] I am I am a sinner saved by grace."
[49:44] Amen.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; You are a sinner saved by grace.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; His grace is why HE CAME DOWN ON EARTH
[49:50] HERE TO SHED HIS BLOOD FOR YOU AND I.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; HOW MUCH MORE WOULD YOU SAY, LORD, HAVE
[49:55] MERCY ON ME?
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Let me read this.
[50:06] There are two influences of power on
[50:08] earth. [snorts] And I want to read from
[50:10] the message atonement.
[50:13] The prophet said, "Just below the
[50:15] regions of mortal beings
[50:19] lay the realms of demon power.
[50:23] Just above that lays the soul of the
[50:26] unjust.
[50:28] Below it lays the very domain of Satan
[50:32] which is hell.
[50:34] Then [snorts] just above us lays the
[50:36] Holy Spirit.
[50:38] Then under that under the altar lays the
[50:41] souls of the just man. Then the next is
[50:45] God himself.
[50:48] One going downward,
[50:50] one going upwards.
[50:53] Two choices.
[50:55] One going where? Downwards and one going
[50:59] upwards.
[51:00] The two spirits are here on earth
[51:07] influencing the people of this earth.
[51:12] So which means that we have two spirits
[51:14] influencing us.
[51:17] Every decision we make under two
[51:20] influences.
[51:22] That's why Joshua said, "Choose you this
[51:24] day
[51:25] &gt;&gt; whom you will serve."
[51:28] church, who do you want to serve today?
[51:31] Don't tell me that I've been a church
[51:32] member for the past 10 years. That
[51:34] doesn't count. You know, most of times
[51:37] we are the people that are even the
[51:38] worst enemies and worst corporates.
[51:42] We come to church and use that as a
[51:44] covering.
[51:45] Get that out. Let the almighty God be
[51:48] the covering of your life.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Don't use church or don't use religion
[51:52] as a covering.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; It wouldn't take us anywhere.
[51:57] two spirits, one downwards,
[52:01] one upwards, one above us, one below us.
[52:06] Now, these two spirits, he says there's
[52:09] only going to be two classes of people
[52:11] in the last day.
[52:15] Both of them is going to wear a mark.
[52:21] The mark of God is the baptism of the
[52:24] Holy Spirit. Amen.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Don't you love that church?
[52:29] &gt;&gt; The mark of God is the Holy Spirit.
[52:33] Which means if you have the spirit of
[52:34] God in you,
[52:36] &gt;&gt; he says that you are sealed until the
[52:38] day of what? Redemption.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; I love this.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Without a shadow of doubt. And then
[52:48] all that was not sealed by the Holy
[52:50] Spirit
[52:52] was all those that were not sealed by
[52:55] the Holy Spirit will take the mark of
[52:58] the beasts.
[53:01] And the mark of the beast is the mark
[53:05] minute please is the mark of apostasy
[53:10] which is rejecting
[53:12] the Holy Spirit.
[53:16] church
[53:18] as we getting it right now here it says
[53:20] that there are two what spirits
[53:25] but I want to be associated with the
[53:29] spirit of the almighty God
[53:31] &gt;&gt; that is why I'm here I'm not here for
[53:33] any kind of sake I'm not here to please
[53:35] anybody look church if you come to
[53:38] church and you want to please somebody
[53:40] then you're making a mistake if you're
[53:42] living your life to please somebody
[53:44] you're making a mistake. If you're
[53:46] living your life to please the pastor,
[53:47] you're making a mistake. The pastor is
[53:50] not the one you're you're looking up to.
[53:53] The only person that you have the right
[53:55] to look up to is the almighty God.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Look at him and leave.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:12] There's one time we're having a
[54:14] discussion
[54:16] and I come to realize that whatsoever
[54:19] that we tend to do, whatsoever that we
[54:22] tend to say, it should be seived by the
[54:25] word of God.
[54:27] Our life should be seed by the word of
[54:29] God. Our speeches should be seived by
[54:32] the word of God. Our relation to our
[54:35] brothers and sisters should be seed by
[54:36] the word of God. Even our work ethics
[54:40] should be saved by the word of God. Why?
[54:42] Because we are not like them.
[54:45] We are different.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; It says what is it? The mind is the womb
[54:53] for the spirit
[54:57] to take in or let out.
[55:01] That was his knowledge. His mind the
[55:03] womb of his mind. the battlegrounds
[55:07] where the battle is fought in the mind.
[55:12] Now look at this. We are being told of
[55:17] how to make our decisions. You and I
[55:19] have got to make a decision. And that
[55:22] decision that we need to make starts
[55:23] from somewhere.
[55:25] It starts from the mind. And this has
[55:28] been one thing that is so key to our
[55:31] life.
[55:32] The mind of Christ in you makes you live
[55:34] a Christlike life.
[55:37] But the mind of the enemy makes you live
[55:39] a different life altogether.
[55:41] But my prayer this morning is that may
[55:43] our life, our minds be renewed in line
[55:46] with the word of God.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; And that is why you are here
[55:51] in the book of Romans. It says that
[55:53] Romans 8 and verse 7 says because the
[55:55] cannon mind is enmity against God.
[56:01] That's what it says.
[56:03] For it is not subject to the law of God,
[56:06] neither indeed can be. In each of us, I
[56:10] want to say this. In each of us, there
[56:13] are two dogs.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; In each of us, there are two dogs.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; I don't know which dog leads you this
[56:23] morning,
[56:25] but let me just read something.
[56:27] These two dogs, there is one which is
[56:30] good
[56:32] and there's one which is evil.
[56:35] The one which is good, it is of joy,
[56:41] peace.
[56:43] These are the attributes of the of the
[56:45] dog that is good. It is of joy, peace,
[56:51] love, hope, serenity,
[56:55] humility,
[56:57] kindness.
[56:59] Look, you can't tell me that,
[57:02] oh, I don't have one of this, but I'm
[57:04] still of God.
[57:07] The Godhead
[57:09] dwelleth
[57:11] fully in the bride of Christ. There is
[57:16] not a single one omitted from it. So if
[57:19] you tell me that oh I love my brother I
[57:22] do this I do this but I don't have the
[57:24] spirit of humility then I'll question
[57:26] what kind of life it is or what kind of
[57:28] spirit is in you because the life of God
[57:33] gives this lovely and sweet attributes.
[57:38] Now amongst we brethren one of the
[57:42] simplest virtue
[57:44] that we even find so difficult to give
[57:46] out is the spirit of forgiveness.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; BRETHREN,
[57:55] &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE WE DOING?
[57:57] AMEN.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; GOD FORGAVE THE
[57:59] &gt;&gt; WORER.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; And you are TELLING ME THAT GOD IS YOUR
[58:03] father and this same God is in you
[58:06] &gt;&gt; that you're able to hate your brother.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; God be merciful unto us.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Abraham said, "If you have the love of
[58:21] Christ in you, you would love your worst
[58:24] enemy.
[58:27] He didn't say your enemy. He said your
[58:29] what?
[58:30] &gt;&gt; So worse
[58:32] enemy.
[58:34] But you come and tell me, "Oh, that's my
[58:36] brother." But you hate the brother. The
[58:39] brother has offended you. Forgive the
[58:41] brother is an issue.
[58:43] Your wife has offended you. Forgive your
[58:45] wife is a problem. Your husband has
[58:48] offended you. Forgive your husband is an
[58:51] issue. Your pastor has made a mistake.
[58:54] Look, let me tell you, every one of us
[58:55] in here are capable of making mistakes.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; We are not immune to mistakes.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; We would make them.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; We will continue to make them. But the
[59:05] point is this. When you realize that
[59:07] you've made A MISTAKE, GO BACK AND MAKE
[59:09] IT RIGHT.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; That is what the scripture says.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; And when you go back and make it right,
[59:15] you the person have offended should be
[59:17] able to say, "Brother, I have even
[59:20] forgiven you."
[59:23] That is the love of God.
[59:27] Oh, I love God. God is in my heart. What
[59:30] kind of love do you have when you can't
[59:32] forgive your your own self? Oh, if
[59:35] you're not able to forgive your brother,
[59:36] it's a reflection of your character.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; I don't care how many prayer tongues or
[59:44] whatsoever you give or prophecies you
[59:46] give. If you can't forgive,
[59:51] I don't know why I'm dwelling on this
[59:52] this morning.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; It's horrible.
[59:59] We all brothers.
[1:00:01] We all sisters.
[1:00:03] I would offend you. Please. Your mouth.
[1:00:06] In your mouth, you have your teeth in
[1:00:08] there.
[1:00:10] You have your tongue in there. It gets
[1:00:13] [snorts] to a point in time, those two,
[1:00:14] they fight.
[1:00:18] Oh yes, they fight.
[1:00:20] And when they fighting, don't know when
[1:00:21] they fight. They fight over food.
[1:00:25] When there's food in your mouth and
[1:00:26] you're eating, the teeth will just slam
[1:00:29] the tongue and you go like,
[1:00:32] it's painful. But at the end of it all,
[1:00:35] the two are STILL LIVING IN THE SAME
[1:00:37] MOUTH.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; THE TWO ARE STILL THERE.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU'RE ABLE TO EAT.
[1:00:48] So if I offend you and you come to
[1:00:51] church like God bless you.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Look this God blessing is even a curse.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Don't say it.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Go and repent and come back and tell me
[1:01:03] that God bless you.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; God merciful to us.
[1:01:18] We have two doors. One is good, one is
[1:01:20] evil. But my prayer is the Lord, may we
[1:01:23] have the good one. May we make the right
[1:01:26] choice this hour. May we make the right
[1:01:28] choice this morning.
[1:01:31] If you don't have any choice to make,
[1:01:33] say, Lord, may your will be done upon my
[1:01:35] life.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; That's all we need for. And this starts
[1:01:40] from one place, from your mind.
[1:01:45] I wrote something. He said, "Your
[1:01:47] thoughts becomes your words.
[1:01:51] Your words becomes your actions.
[1:01:55] Your actions becomes your habit.
[1:02:00] Your habit becomes your attitude.
[1:02:04] And your attitude becomes your
[1:02:06] character.
[1:02:08] And your character shows me who you
[1:02:10] are."
[1:02:12] And that's the reason why prophet said
[1:02:15] character
[1:02:16] a godly character is victory
[1:02:22] because if you have the character of
[1:02:24] Christ in you there is nothing you can
[1:02:26] never overcome on this earth.
[1:02:29] I don't care what the challenges will
[1:02:31] be. It might be so huge. The almighty
[1:02:35] God will give you that character to
[1:02:36] overcome it.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[1:02:43] The prophet said
[1:02:45] now it's a strange thing that this is so
[1:02:49] much taught of people
[1:02:52] they say well I am weak
[1:02:55] my faith is not very much
[1:02:59] I am not a very good Christian
[1:03:03] says that's just what the devil wants
[1:03:05] you to stay
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; you are just talking his language right
[1:03:13] You're talking the devil's language. Oh,
[1:03:15] I don't have the strength. I'm not that
[1:03:18] good. Who is good?
[1:03:21] Who is good?
[1:03:23] He said, you must never say that. Don't
[1:03:26] never let your testimony be negative.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; LET IT BE POSITIVE ALL [screaming]
[1:03:35] THE TIME.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; He didn't say sometime.
[1:03:39] He said what?
[1:03:43] [snorts]
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "I am saved." That should be
[1:03:46] your testimony.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; I have God in my heart.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; I believe him with all my heart.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Do you believe in DIVINE HEALING? WITH
[1:03:57] ALL MY HEART.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Do you believe you ARE SAVED? WITH ALL
[1:04:01] MY HEART.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; DO you believe YOU ARE BLESSED? WITH ALL
[1:04:06] MY HEART. CHURCH, don't say something
[1:04:09] negative about your life.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; You know our mouths, the words out of
[1:04:15] your mouth are powerful.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; There are two edges sword.
[1:04:22] I would always want to say something
[1:04:23] positive about myself.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; When I say something about positive
[1:04:27] about myself, then I say something
[1:04:29] positive about everybody around me.
[1:04:32] I've always said that look the
[1:04:33] reflection of who I am is the same thing
[1:04:36] of those around me.
[1:04:40] If I speak positive I always have people
[1:04:42] that speak positive around me instead of
[1:04:44] oh but sometimes you know oh yeah
[1:04:46] sometimes but let your reflection
[1:04:48] reflect in them.
[1:04:51] If you know the God you serve let that
[1:04:53] be a reflection in the life of those
[1:04:56] you're working with.
[1:04:58] Don't let if they're able to influence
[1:05:00] you, go back in there and take complete
[1:05:03] inventory of your life.
[1:05:07] Choose you this day whom you will serve.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; If you're going to serve God, serve him
[1:05:13] in the complete fullness of his glory.
[1:05:16] If you want to serve the devil, that's
[1:05:18] up to you. But Joseph said, "For me and
[1:05:22] my household, we will serve the Almighty
[1:05:25] God."
[1:05:29] It says, "And God can only bless you
[1:05:35] as you confess that he has done it for
[1:05:38] you."
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; And God can only bless you as you
[1:05:46] confess that he has done it for who? for
[1:05:48] you.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; He is the high priest of your
[1:05:53] confession.
[1:05:57] [laughter]
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; He can only do for us as we accept it.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; And believe it
[1:06:08] and confess it.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Look at the three. It says what he can
[1:06:13] only do for us as we accept it.
[1:06:17] That's right.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; If you don't accept it, IT CAN'T DO IT
[1:06:19] FOR YOU.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; And you believe it.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; I believe I am healed.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; I don't care what the devil would do.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; I don't care what the devil will plan
[1:06:28] against my life. As long as I believe
[1:06:30] that I am healed, I am healed.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, pastor has prayed for me so many
[1:06:35] years. Everything is not working out.
[1:06:37] Believe it.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; I am growing. I don't know when I'm
[1:06:42] going to get married. Believe it. You
[1:06:43] will surely get married.
[1:06:45] I have been praying for the seed of the
[1:06:47] womb all these years but I don't know
[1:06:48] where church believe it.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Let it be the confession of your mouth.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Let everything about you be positive.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; We are always cloud with negativity.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; When things go way we don't know the god
[1:07:04] we're serving.
[1:07:06] Then we go like what is going on? Look,
[1:07:09] the moment you start complaining,
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; I've always been saying this forever. I
[1:07:14] said, look, the moment you start
[1:07:16] complaining,
[1:07:18] that problem wouldn't go, but that
[1:07:20] problem will continue multiplying.
[1:07:24] Do you know why? Because you are
[1:07:26] watering the problem.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; The more you complain, you've taken
[1:07:32] water and watering that problem.
[1:07:35] And you know what going to do? because
[1:07:37] you are worshiping it and you're
[1:07:39] complaining about it, it will keep
[1:07:41] growing.
[1:07:43] It will keep growing. But when that
[1:07:45] problem is in there and say you
[1:07:50] I have a God.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; He said in his word,
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; he is never never going to leave me nor
[1:07:56] forsake me.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; He also said in his word, I am not
[1:08:00] fighting against flesh and blood.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; He also said in his word that the Lord
[1:08:04] is my shepherd. He also said in his
[1:08:07] word, I am the alpha and the omega.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; He also said in his word that whosoever
[1:08:10] asks, it shall be GRANTED UNTO HIM.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; YOU [screaming] THIS EVIL OR WHATSOEVER
[1:08:15] obstacle it is, I am victorious.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Do you know what you do? You suppress
[1:08:20] the problem.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Believe it and confess it.
[1:08:28] Jesus Christ is my savior.
[1:08:32] All things are mine by God.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Church, when we're coming this morning,
[1:08:39] we had a lot of conversations, but
[1:08:41] there's something that came in and I
[1:08:44] want to encourage you. This end time
[1:08:46] message, God has given us every promise
[1:08:50] in his word.
[1:08:53] But this end times it tend to we've
[1:08:56] always surrounded in a way that it seems
[1:08:58] that we don't prosper.
[1:09:02] It seems that we don't grow. We tend to
[1:09:05] we tend to uh h um portion like being
[1:09:10] prosperous
[1:09:11] as evil.
[1:09:15] Look, I can give you in the message
[1:09:19] where the prophet the brah himself
[1:09:22] talked about being prosperous.
[1:09:25] He said that I will buy a certain type
[1:09:28] of car. My son will buy something
[1:09:31] different and the other one will buy
[1:09:33] something greater. Look at the
[1:09:35] possession. Look, we need to believe in
[1:09:38] God that God has given us everything.
[1:09:40] Amen.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; The point is the motive behind what he
[1:09:43] has given to you and how you're going to
[1:09:45] use it.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; When money comes in, it tends to bring
[1:09:48] in pride.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; That's that's the whole thing. You tend
[1:09:54] to feel so high and mighty. You tend to
[1:09:56] do respect. But look, it's no wrong to
[1:09:59] be blessed.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; It's not wrong to be rich.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; It's no wrong to be prosperous.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; It has been given to us in this word.
[1:10:09] And he said, "I have given everything."
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; He didn't say some.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; He said, "What?" Everything. [screaming]
[1:10:17] So everything on on earth here is for
[1:10:20] me.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Abraham said, "Never permit a negative
[1:10:32] thought to come in your mind if you can
[1:10:35] help it.
[1:10:39] When it starts,
[1:10:42] don't entertain it.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Well, you say, "I can't help the
[1:10:49] thoughts from coming." It's true. You
[1:10:50] can't help it. It will surely come.
[1:10:53] Sometimes in the especially when
[1:10:55] somebody has done something against you,
[1:10:58] you want to open your mouth annoyed if
[1:11:00] you can strike this person.
[1:11:03] Oh yeah. Sometimes we do that.
[1:11:08] I hate this brother. Who gave you a
[1:11:10] spirit of hate?
[1:11:14] I dislike this sister. Really? I come to
[1:11:17] the house of God.
[1:11:23] He said, "Well,
[1:11:25] I can't help the thought from coming."
[1:11:27] The prophet said, "Like the farmer that
[1:11:30] said he couldn't he couldn't stop the
[1:11:32] bears from flying over his place.
[1:11:36] But he could sure stop them from
[1:11:38] roosting.
[1:11:40] You can't help the thoughts when they
[1:11:42] come.
[1:11:44] But don't entertain them. Just let them
[1:11:48] pass.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Look, negative thoughts will always
[1:11:53] come.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; This mind of always is always revolving.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; As you're sitting down here, listen to
[1:12:01] me. There are a lot of thoughts rumbling
[1:12:03] in your minds.
[1:12:05] Oh yes, some is thinking about oh I need
[1:12:08] to go to work.
[1:12:10] Someone is thinking that when we close
[1:12:12] service, what food am I going to eat?
[1:12:14] Someone is thinking tomorrow the
[1:12:16] children will be going to school. There
[1:12:17] are a lot of thoughts rumbling in there.
[1:12:21] But you know what? Don't let the
[1:12:22] negative ones have that effect upon your
[1:12:25] life.
[1:12:26] We tend to let these negative thoughts
[1:12:29] affect us to the extent that our faces
[1:12:30] become so crumbled when we are walking.
[1:12:35] Oh yes, you see people's faces instead
[1:12:37] of you being so bright and praising
[1:12:38] almighty God. They look so crumbled like
[1:12:41] they are fighting with you. They're not
[1:12:42] fighting with you. They're fighting with
[1:12:43] themselves.
[1:12:46] DROP THIS BURDEN.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; GOD SAID, "LEAVE THEM AT my feet.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; He's surely going to handle them for
[1:12:53] you."
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Look, there's no problem or burden that
[1:12:56] you can solve.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. I'm telling you church,
[1:13:02] everything that you've solved is not by
[1:13:03] your grace.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; It's by the grace of the almighty God.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; He has done it for you.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; So why don't you put every burden at his
[1:13:10] feet?
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; If you can't pay your bills, put it at
[1:13:15] his feet. He will surely grant it.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; If there's sickness, put it at his feet.
[1:13:19] He's surely going. Look, he is the
[1:13:21] healer.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; He is the provider.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; He is our comforter. Amen.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; He is our shield.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; And he has promised us that I'll be with
[1:13:32] you
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; even in you,
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; today,
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; tomorrow, and when?
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; To the end of the world.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; So, did I put smile on your face?
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Let's give a clap offering to the mighty
[1:13:45] God.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:50] There is one thing as children of God.
[1:13:55] I know that we need to make a choice.
[1:13:57] But I should believe that I know the
[1:13:59] choices you are making.
[1:14:01] And the choice is to follow Jesus. I
[1:14:04] want to follow Jesus the rest of my
[1:14:06] life.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; And if I know the man I am following,
[1:14:10] I'll always create a very good
[1:14:12] atmosphere around me.
[1:14:15] The prophet said you create your own
[1:14:19] atmosphere around you.
[1:14:22] Don't never have no negative testimony.
[1:14:27] It says testify positive.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus has healed me. I am well.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Go and you receive your healing.
[1:14:43] These are creating that atmosphere
[1:14:45] around you believing that the almighty
[1:14:48] God has done it. Let me give a little
[1:14:51] testimony here. There was a sister and a
[1:14:53] brother got married. They've been
[1:14:56] seeking for the fruit of the womb for
[1:14:57] quite a long time. They had struggled it
[1:15:01] every medical help and staff and prayer
[1:15:03] and everything. They've done it.
[1:15:05] But according to that testimony, they
[1:15:06] said they went down to a servant of God
[1:15:08] and the servant of God told them now
[1:15:09] says, "Do you believe that God can give
[1:15:11] you?" said, "Yes, I believe it." He
[1:15:14] said, "Then go and start preparing for
[1:15:16] it."
[1:15:19] Do you know what she did? She created
[1:15:21] her own atmosphere.
[1:15:23] Church, let's create our own atmosphere.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; She went back home, prepared a room.
[1:15:30] Honey, let's go and buy the court. Let's
[1:15:32] go and buy this.
[1:15:35] What sex do you want? She said, "Oh, I
[1:15:37] think this should be a female. Let's buy
[1:15:39] all the pinky pinky stuffs. You know
[1:15:42] ladies and pinky color and ladies love
[1:15:44] pinky colors. That's your nature. Don't
[1:15:46] worry. Bought all the pinky pinky stuff.
[1:15:50] Dress the whole place. You enter to the
[1:15:52] room, the whole place is so pinky pinky.
[1:15:54] So you get to see that this is a baby
[1:15:56] girl coming. She believed in HER OWN
[1:15:58] TESTIMONY. SHE CREATED HER OWN
[1:16:01] ATMOSPHERE AROUND IT. And do you KNOW
[1:16:03] WHAT? BY THE GRACE OF GOD, SHE GAVE
[1:16:05] birth to a baby girl.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Church. Amen.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; We have testimonies you can give.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; What's your testimony this morning?
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; What's your testimony?
[1:16:19] Is it testimony of negativity?
[1:16:25] Till when?
[1:16:27] Lord, till when? Don't ask God that
[1:16:28] question.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; DON'T ASK HIM TILL WHEN.
[1:16:38] What you need to ask God is that Lord, I
[1:16:40] thank you for what you have given me
[1:16:44] [laughter]
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; and I thank you for what you are still
[1:16:47] giving me
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; and I'm thanking you for what you even
[1:16:50] have in store for me
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; and I KNOW AT THE RIGHT TIME
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; LISTEN AT THE WHAT AT THE RIGHT TIME
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; you will give it to me.
[1:17:03] You see this watch?
[1:17:07] This time is not God's time.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; What's the time right now?
[1:17:14] Almost half 11 if I'm right. Good.
[1:17:18] According to God's time is not half.
[1:17:22] God is preparing his own time.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; If you are seeking for something, let me
[1:17:27] encourage you this morning. If you're
[1:17:30] seeking for something,
[1:17:33] if you want to get married and you're
[1:17:35] getting old, look, let that old age be a
[1:17:38] beauty of your life.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Don't let anybody pressure you.
[1:17:44] Don't anybody push you and you are
[1:17:46] GETTING LOOK IF ANYBODY TELLS YOU THAT
[1:17:48] WHEN WILL YOU GET MARRIED SAY when will
[1:17:49] you die?
[1:17:55] ASK THE PERSON WHEN WILL THE PERSON DIE.
[1:17:59] If you are asking ME WHEN WILL I GET
[1:18:01] MARRIED. God bless you brother. God
[1:18:03] bless your sister. [laughter]
[1:18:05] Please when will you also die.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; You asking ME WHEN I GET MARRIED. I
[1:18:14] DON'T KNOW.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; JUST AS YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU'RE GOING
[1:18:17] TO DIE.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; SO PRAISE GOD FOR MY LIFE.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Hey sister, you're getting too old
[1:18:27] brother. Hey everybody's getting sister
[1:18:30] please when is your casket also getting
[1:18:32] ready
[1:18:42] we don't make fun behind the pulpit but
[1:18:44] what I'm telling you is the truth
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; I don't know when a brother is going to
[1:18:49] get married I don't know when a sister
[1:18:51] is going to get married just the same
[1:18:54] way I don't know when I'm going to die
[1:18:56] all I just need to do is I need to thank
[1:18:58] God for the kind of life I am living.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; I need to live in line with the word of
[1:19:02] God. As long as I've chosen to serve
[1:19:04] God, all I do is I put my trust in him.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; I put my belief in him. I PUT EVERYTHING
[1:19:10] OF MY LIFE ON GOD AND HE WILL DO IT
[1:19:13] ACCORDING TO HIS RICHES IN GLORY.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Please tell me, married ones, those that
[1:19:21] have children, when did you know when
[1:19:24] you're going to give birth?
[1:19:27] Oh no, let's talk about this.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; There are certain things we need to talk
[1:19:31] in the house of God. Don't let us talk
[1:19:32] about it outside. Let's talk about it in
[1:19:34] the house of God.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; When did you know you're going to give
[1:19:38] birth to your your 12-year-old son?
[1:19:39] Pastor, so sorry I'm using him.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; God gave him to you in his own appointed
[1:19:48] time.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; That is the same way he's going to work
[1:19:51] everything for your good in his time.
[1:19:54] Child don't rush things. All it just
[1:19:57] need is just to believe. Say, "Lord, I
[1:20:00] believe you. I believe in your steps. I
[1:20:03] believe in your direction. I believe in
[1:20:05] your blessing. When the time is right, I
[1:20:08] know you will make it right. When the
[1:20:10] time is right, he will make it
[1:20:11] beautiful.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Look,
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; just put your trust in the Almighty God.
[1:20:24] Oh Lord, I've been desiring this. Lord,
[1:20:28] when?
[1:20:30] Lord, when? Lord, when?
[1:20:34] Look,
[1:20:35] if you want to ask God when, challenge
[1:20:38] him.
[1:20:41] I'm giving a secret to that. Challenge
[1:20:43] him. Do you know the almighty God has
[1:20:45] given us the the the the step to
[1:20:48] challenge him? Do you know that
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; I'm almost the victim? I don't know the
[1:20:52] vote. I'm just bringing across. It says
[1:20:55] that whatsoever you want me to do,
[1:20:58] challenge me.
[1:21:01] It's in the scriptures.
[1:21:04] But you don't challenge him.
[1:21:07] You go to him. Look,
[1:21:10] if pastor son wants something, he stand
[1:21:13] up and goes to pastor. Pastor, daddy.
[1:21:16] No, he wouldn't use pastor. Sorry.
[1:21:18] Daddy,
[1:21:20] my teacher says that I need to bring
[1:21:23] this and this and this and that. Do you
[1:21:25] know what the son has done? He's given
[1:21:28] his orders.
[1:21:30] He doesn't care how you're going to
[1:21:31] provide.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Are you getting it?
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Ah, church get the revelation of this.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; When it goes to mama, mommy teacher says
[1:21:42] that I need to do this. the head
[1:21:44] mistress or head master says I you need
[1:21:45] to do this and this and he has put his
[1:21:48] request.
[1:21:50] HE DOESN'T CARE HOW YOU'RE GOING TO DO
[1:21:51] IT.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; He doesn't want to know how you're going
[1:21:54] to do it.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; All he wants that it should be done.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:59] [laughter]
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; At the end of it,
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; it will be done.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; GO TO GOD. TELL HIM THAT LORD, I HAVE
[1:22:06] SAVED YOU WITH MY LIFE IN SINCERITY and
[1:22:09] in honesty.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; I HAVE PAID MY DUES. I'VE PAID MY TITHE.
[1:22:14] CHURCH, there's one thing we tend to
[1:22:16] omit.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; And this I know majority of ministers
[1:22:23] find it difficult to see, but I'm going
[1:22:25] to say it here.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; I am a minister of which I always pray
[1:22:31] to God that God should open up the
[1:22:33] blessings for his children.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; And if you want to receive the blessings
[1:22:38] of God, do you know what it is?
[1:22:39] It says bring your tithes and offering
[1:22:41] to the house.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Look, paying of tithe,
[1:22:48] don't assume that pain of tithe is for
[1:22:50] your pastor.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Don't assume that paying of tithe is for
[1:22:56] the for the enrichment of your pastor.
[1:22:59] Lord,
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; if you get the revelation of the pain of
[1:23:01] tithe, when you pay tithe, you are
[1:23:03] opening an account in heaven.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Church, get this very well.
[1:23:09] When you pay your tithe, you are opening
[1:23:11] an account in heaven.
[1:23:14] And that account in heaven is the bank
[1:23:16] is the bank of heaven.
[1:23:19] When the moment you pay your tithe, you
[1:23:21] are deposited in your account. If your
[1:23:24] account is Nelson, it will bear the name
[1:23:25] Nelson. When I when I pay my tithe, it
[1:23:28] goes into my account.
[1:23:30] It doesn't go into the account of Bati.
[1:23:34] It goes into my own account. And when it
[1:23:37] gets into my account, you know doing
[1:23:38] what I'm doing. I'm counting my
[1:23:40] blessings.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; I want to feel free. Pastor, I hope I'm
[1:23:45] I'm I'm I'm at God bless you.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; When you open that account,
[1:23:54] that account has lot of blessings.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Oh church, are you getting this?
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; That account in THAT ACCOUNT THERE'S
[1:24:02] EVERY BLESSING OF GOD IN IT.
[1:24:05] ALL you need to do is pay your money
[1:24:08] into your account. That account don't
[1:24:10] assume that account is for somebody.
[1:24:13] It's your name.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Inscribed
[1:24:17] with the blood of Jesus.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; It's yours.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; So as you're putting it in there,
[1:24:24] you are feeling your blessings.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; So when IT COMES TO THE POINT OF WHEREBY
[1:24:28] YOU WANT TO GO DOWN TO YOUR ACCOUNT AND
[1:24:30] WITHDRAW THE BLESSINGS FOR HEALING,
[1:24:32] hold on.
[1:24:35] If you have a bank account and you have
[1:24:37] money in it, when you're going to the
[1:24:39] bank, you go with your chest out,
[1:24:43] your shoulders high. Why? Because you
[1:24:46] know that you have money in there.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; You are going to withdraw. But when you
[1:24:50] have just about just two pound or five
[1:24:52] pound, would you go to the bank with
[1:24:54] your shoulders high? You are even
[1:24:56] ashamed going.
[1:25:01] Amen.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; You ashamed going.
[1:25:05] That's the same way in your heavenly
[1:25:07] account when it's empty and you're going
[1:25:09] before God.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:25:12] Lord have mercy on me. But when you have
[1:25:15] it full and you go there, say, Lord, I
[1:25:18] want my healing.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; The almighty God says,
[1:25:22] test me.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; I love that word. HE SAID, "TRY ME
[1:25:26] [screaming]
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; AND SEE IF I WOULDN'T OPEN UP THE
[1:25:30] WINDOWS OF HEAVEN
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; AND BLESS YOU."
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; PLEASE, is it in the word of God or not?
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Am I the one saying it?
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, church, answer me. Am I the one
[1:25:41] saying it?
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; God is challenging you.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Put it in there.
[1:25:51] When you go, the Lord, I have served you
[1:25:54] faithfully.
[1:25:56] I have paid my tithe and offense.
[1:25:59] I have served it diligently.
[1:26:02] Look, this time this situation is
[1:26:04] coming.
[1:26:06] I want to lose my job. And I've been
[1:26:09] faithful to you. I don't know why they
[1:26:12] want to do this.
[1:26:13] Father, may your everlasting presence
[1:26:16] come and take control.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; No, God will be there at that very
[1:26:19] moment.
[1:26:22] Even if you lose that job,
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; he will open up a wonderful window for
[1:26:26] you.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; No, there are a lot of things you can
[1:26:34] challenge God
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; for your healing. Go to that account.
[1:26:40] And that account, God is sitting there.
[1:26:43] He is the bank manager.
[1:26:46] He's watching it as he flows. Oh, okay.
[1:26:49] My son is doing fine. My daughter is
[1:26:50] doing good. Okay.
[1:26:52] He's always looking at your account
[1:26:53] every day. Look at your account. The
[1:26:56] moment you go there and you ring the
[1:26:58] bell and say, "Lord, master," he said,
[1:27:00] "Yes, my son, my daughter. Here I am.
[1:27:02] What is it?" Said, "Lord, I'm coming to
[1:27:04] cash out of my account."
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; What are you coming to cash out? I'm
[1:27:08] coming to cash out my wedding ceremony.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; What are you coming to cash out? I'm
[1:27:14] coming to cash out my son.
[1:27:17] What are you coming to cash? I'm coming
[1:27:18] to cash out my daughter.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; What are you coming to cash out? I'm
[1:27:21] coming to cash out my blessings.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Church, look, we have a living God.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; I know that the choice you've made today
[1:27:29] is to follow Jesus Christ.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; And if you if you've decided to follow
[1:27:33] him, let's do what is required of him.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; And let's stop the complaints.
[1:27:41] We are more than the complaints. We have
[1:27:44] the power over every complaint. Create
[1:27:47] the positive atmosphere
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; in your life.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; If you believe it, if you work on it, it
[1:27:55] will reflect on you.
[1:28:03] Let me read this from the prophecies.
[1:28:06] I just want to say
[1:28:08] there's so many people passing through
[1:28:11] here that suffering with mental
[1:28:14] oppression,
[1:28:17] demon manifestation,
[1:28:20] but oppression is from the devil.
[1:28:24] The prophet said, "I seen a vision break
[1:28:26] before me of a young lady.
[1:28:29] She went back there and sat down a few
[1:28:32] minutes ago that she thinks she's
[1:28:34] crossed the separating line."
[1:28:38] He says, "Don't let Satan tell you that
[1:28:44] as long as you love God
[1:28:48] and God still loves you,
[1:28:52] DON'T LET THE devil tell you that
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Lord, my end has come to an end." What
[1:29:01] end is come to an end?
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Who created thy end?
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Who brought thy end? You look the
[1:29:08] scripture says as long as God hasn't
[1:29:09] said it, it would never be.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that can ever befall you
[1:29:15] until the purpose of God in your life is
[1:29:17] fulfilled.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; If everything God has destined for your
[1:29:23] life isn't been fulfilled, you are going
[1:29:26] nowhere.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Let the devil DO WHATEVER WANTS. LOOK,
[1:29:32] LET ALL THE DEVILS OF HELL,
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; THE VOODOO IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES, let
[1:29:36] them come. Oh, you have the power to
[1:29:39] overcome them.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; I don't care what the enemy would do.
[1:29:48] Look, you know, the devil is just a
[1:29:49] funny fool.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; When it comes in, he's just wingling his
[1:29:53] to he's wingling his tail. Look, the
[1:29:55] moment he comes in and he's just shaking
[1:29:57] and just and you're also scared,
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; then it stops and it start popping off.
[1:30:01] But when it comes and see you yourself,
[1:30:03] you're strong and powerful. Then it
[1:30:05] starts panicking.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Don't give room to the enemy.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Church, don't let us give room to him.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; He has no power over you.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; He has no power over us.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; We have the victory.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Church, I said we have the victory.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; We have the victory.
[1:30:31] Don't let Satan tell you that as long as
[1:30:34] you love God, God still loves you. It
[1:30:39] says
[1:30:41] it has to be a creator to create that
[1:30:45] creation in your heart to make you love
[1:30:47] God.
[1:30:49] Isn't this beautiful?
[1:30:52] Go believing with all your heart that
[1:30:55] Christ loves you.
[1:31:00] church. We can talk more. There is lot
[1:31:03] more. But I want us to have a little
[1:31:05] reflection this hour
[1:31:07] and probably close around this time.
[1:31:12] You are not here on this earth by
[1:31:13] chance.
[1:31:16] You are not bought on this earth to come
[1:31:19] over and suffer.
[1:31:24] God brought you here for a purpose.
[1:31:27] And that purpose is to live a victorious
[1:31:30] life.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; I Nelson I said I believe it.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; He brought you here to live a victorious
[1:31:38] life.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; But we have given the enemy the chance
[1:31:43] to toy with us.
[1:31:46] And you know what he does? Instead of we
[1:31:48] having the love of God in our lives, he
[1:31:50] has rather put enmity in our lives.
[1:31:55] Then things that we can overcome with
[1:31:57] love, we are trying to overcome it with
[1:31:59] en with envy.
[1:32:05] Maybe a brother can help you out of a
[1:32:06] certain situation. You hate the brother.
[1:32:10] A sister can help you out of that
[1:32:11] situation. You hate THE SISTER. WHY?
[1:32:14] JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING SOME political
[1:32:16] issue.
[1:32:19] Where is the virtue of forgiveness?
[1:32:21] Do you know that forgiveness is also a
[1:32:24] virtue?
[1:32:25] It is.
[1:32:28] Just as love is a virtue, forgiveness is
[1:32:31] in there. Don't tell me that you love
[1:32:34] God and you're unable to forgive.
[1:32:37] Don't tell me that you love God and
[1:32:38] you're not able to help one another.
[1:32:41] And we live hypocritical life
[1:32:45] and we come here every day then we sing
[1:32:46] and praise the almighty God. Whom are we
[1:32:48] serving?
[1:32:53] choose you this day whom you will serve.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; I and my household, we shall serve the
[1:32:58] Lord.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Church, let the team of our life be God.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Everything we are going through is just
[1:33:07] a face of life.
[1:33:09] Every challenge you're going through, I
[1:33:10] said is what is a face
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; because he God has given us the power to
[1:33:16] overcome
[1:33:18] and in his time we would overcome
[1:33:20] everything.
[1:33:21] And I can even say probably right now
[1:33:23] you are even overcoming.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; So why don't you believe it?
[1:33:28] Why the moment?
[1:33:31] Why the pain?
[1:33:33] Why are you giving up?
[1:33:36] People would come to church and because
[1:33:37] they not able to see, they go like the
[1:33:39] church there's no love. You are the
[1:33:41] [clears throat] first culprit of lack of
[1:33:42] love.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; It's not the church.
[1:33:47] There's always love in the house of God.
[1:33:48] Amen.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Find your position in the house of God
[1:33:52] and do what's expected of you and leave
[1:33:55] the rest to God.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; May the Almighty God help us.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; May he help you.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; May he guide you.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; May he protect you
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; and may he make you see the light that's
[1:34:08] before you.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever the devil is taking away from
[1:34:11] you in the might name of Jesus, may it
[1:34:12] be restored back to you.
[1:34:15] Whatsoever the devil is trying to put
[1:34:16] around your path that is making you
[1:34:18] shaky, may it be put behind you.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Stand on the word of God, stand on the
[1:34:24] CROSS
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; AND SAY, "LORD, [screaming] HAVE MERCY
[1:34:27] ON ME.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; I AM BELIEVING IN YOU. I choose this day
[1:34:30] to follow you the rest of my life."
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Who's ready to do that?
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; I said, "Who's ready to do that?" Amen.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Why don't you stand to your feet
[1:34:41] with your eyes closed,
[1:34:44] your heads bowed?
[1:34:46] I want you to just quiet and just have a
[1:34:48] reflection of your life.
[1:34:51] Don't look at who is on your right and
[1:34:52] who's on your left. I said, eyes closed.
[1:34:56] Ask the almighty GOD, LORD, WHERE HAVE I
[1:35:00] GONE WRONG?
[1:35:08] Today I have decided to follow you Lord.
[1:35:13] I am not turning back again
[1:35:16] and I have if I have come and I go back
[1:35:18] I come and go back today I am not going
[1:35:21] back anymore.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; I want to create that positive
[1:35:25] atmosphere of my life. You have spoken
[1:35:28] to me. He said there is no negativity at
[1:35:33] all in Christianity.
[1:35:36] It's all positive
[1:35:39] done paid for. It is finished. Where was
[1:35:43] it finished? On the cross of Calvary.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Everything about YOUR LIFE IS FINISHED.
[1:35:48] EVERYTHING. WHY IS THE WORRY? WHY IS THE
[1:35:50] BED IN CHURCH?
[1:35:53] Why can't you see the GLORY OF GOD
[1:35:54] AMONGST US?
[1:35:57] But the glory of God is among us. here.
[1:36:01] It's just that we don't believe.
[1:36:04] It says, think of it. It's all
[1:36:07] completed.
[1:36:08] It's all finished.
[1:36:11] It says God cannot do anything else.
[1:36:15] It's already completed.
[1:36:19] when he died at Calvary, every sin that
[1:36:21] was ever committed or ever would or ever
[1:36:24] would be committed was forgiven right
[1:36:27] there on the basis of the shed blood.
[1:36:32] But it says, "But it will never do you
[1:36:35] no good until you accept it."
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Choose you this day whom you receive.
[1:36:45] The power of our choices.
[1:36:48] When you're going to get get married,
[1:36:51] the choice of partner is you.
[1:36:56] Whatsoever you get into that marriage
[1:36:57] happens. It's your choice.
[1:37:01] There is more we can talk about, but
[1:37:02] there's no time. I just want us to have
[1:37:05] this reflection. Think of the choice
[1:37:06] you're making today.
[1:37:09] I believe that you've all decided I want
[1:37:10] to follow Jesus. The less live in line
[1:37:13] with his word.
[1:37:15] Every promise in his word is given to
[1:37:18] you and I.
[1:37:20] Let's claim it by faith. Who has decided
[1:37:23] to walk with Jesus today? I have decided
[1:37:25] to walk with Jesus today of my life.
[1:37:28] Talk to him and say, "Lord,
[1:37:31] have your way in my life."
[1:37:33] Talk to him. Say, "Lord, have mercy on
[1:37:37] me." Talk to the almighty God and ask
[1:37:41] and say, "Lord Jesus, I want to make the
[1:37:43] right Today I have decided to follow
[1:37:47] you. I'm not turning back again. May
[1:37:50] almighty grace and mercy lead me. May
[1:37:53] you guide me. May you direct me. Direct
[1:37:56] my path. May every path of my life be
[1:37:59] you. Everything of my life from A to Z
[1:38:02] be you. Every breath of my life, let it
[1:38:05] be you. Even when I speak, may it be
[1:38:08] you. The step I take, may it be you.
[1:38:14] I have decided
[1:38:19] to follow Jesus.
[1:38:24] I have decided
[1:38:28] to follow Jesus.
[1:38:34] I have decided
[1:38:38] to follow Jesus.
[1:38:43] No turning back.
[1:38:48] No turning back. Hold your keyboard.
[1:38:51] Hold your keyboard.
[1:38:54] I have this
[1:38:58] to follow you.
[1:39:02] Oh,
[1:39:04] I have [screaming]
[1:39:05] decided
[1:39:09] to follow [screaming]
[1:39:10] Jesus.
[1:39:14] I have decided
[1:39:19] to follow Jesus.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; No turning [singing] back.
[1:39:29] No turning back. I want to ask the
[1:39:32] church this morning or afternoon
[1:39:38] who would want to make every commitment
[1:39:40] to follow Jesus this hour.
[1:39:48] Take it that almighty God is standing
[1:39:49] before you this hour.
[1:39:52] Look at him on the cross of Calvary.
[1:39:56] LOOK AT HIS BLOOD SHED FOR YOU BECAUSE
[1:39:58] OF YOU.
[1:40:01] AND ON THAT BUS IS CRYING AND SAY IT IS
[1:40:03] FINISHED.
[1:40:05] He's finished everything for you and I.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Where do you want to turn to right now?
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Why don't you rededicate your life once
[1:40:19] again to him and say, "Lord, I have your
[1:40:20] way in my life."
[1:40:23] COMMIT YOUR HUSBAND TO THE ALMIGHTY GOD.
[1:40:25] COMMIT YOUR WIFE TO ALMIGHTY GOD. BRING
[1:40:28] YOUR CHILDREN TO THE ALTAR OF THE MIGHTY
[1:40:30] GOD.
[1:40:32] BRING YOUR HOUSEHOLD TO him
[1:40:35] and SAY, "LORD,
[1:40:36] I AND my household, WE SHALL SERVE THE
[1:40:39] Lord
[1:40:43] and he will surely grant your heart
[1:40:44] desires. Young ones,
[1:40:49] make it this day. Choose you this day
[1:40:51] whom you will serve."
[1:40:56] LOOK, BE A REFLECTION OF GOD IN WHEREVER
[1:40:59] YOU ARE. In your school, your workplace,
[1:41:04] in your house, in your community,
[1:41:06] wherever you are, be that reflection of
[1:41:08] God.
[1:41:10] And before you can be a reflection of
[1:41:12] him, that is when you've taken him
[1:41:14] completely as your own.
[1:41:22] Ah Lord to us
[1:41:35] before I hand over to the pastor
[1:41:40] I want to ask the church
[1:41:45] if you want to be remembered in prayers
[1:41:47] the pastor will pray for us
[1:41:51] if you know that You've wandered away
[1:41:52] from him.
[1:41:55] You've wandered far in sin.
[1:41:59] Wandered far away and unbelief
[1:42:02] and you want to come home.
[1:42:08] Why don't you signify by the raising of
[1:42:09] your hands? If you want to also approach
[1:42:10] the altar and I want all eyes closed,
[1:42:13] please all eyes closed. If you want to
[1:42:16] approach the altar, you can do so this
[1:42:17] hour.
[1:42:19] Say, "Lord,
[1:42:21] have mercy on me."
[1:42:25] Don't let it be too late.
[1:42:28] Don't let it to be tomorrow.
[1:42:30] If you feel led,
[1:42:35] just do and say, "Lord, here I am."
[1:42:39] If you also want to raise your hand, you
[1:42:40] can just raise your hand wherever you
[1:42:42] are
[1:42:45] and say, "Lord Jesus,
[1:42:49] have your way in my life."
[1:42:56] And as we sing this song, we invite the
[1:42:58] pastor to take over
[1:43:02] to follow
[1:43:04] Jesus.
[1:43:08] I have decided
[1:43:13] to follow Jesus.
[1:43:18] No turning back.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; No turning back.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; I have decided.
[1:43:27] I have decided
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; to follow Jesus.
[1:43:37] I have decided
[1:43:42] to follow Jesus.
[1:43:47] I have
[1:43:51] to follow Jesus.
[1:44:07] The world
[1:44:09] behind me.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; The world
[1:44:19] behind
[1:44:20] me.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Cross before me.
[1:44:27] The world behind
[1:44:30] me.
[1:44:38] Turn.
[1:44:47] Amen. Coming home, Lord. I'm coming
[1:44:51] home. And if you know a song, Lord, I'm
[1:44:53] coming home.
[1:44:57] Coming.
[1:45:01] Oh,

[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:45:28] I'm coming.

[1:45:57] wide [singing] arms
[1:45:59] of blood.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:46:04] I'm coming.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; I've wandered far away.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; I wondered
[1:46:14] far
[1:46:16] away
[1:46:18] from God.
[1:46:21] Now
[1:46:22] I'm coming

[1:47:09] wide
[1:47:11] arms
[1:47:13] of life.
[1:47:16] The Lord

[1:47:21] home.
[1:47:25] I have wasted
[1:47:29] preious
[1:47:32] years.
[1:47:34] Now
[1:47:35] I'm coming
[1:47:38] home. [music]
[1:47:43] I now repent
[1:47:47] with
[1:47:49] her tears.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord,
[1:47:53] I'm coming [singing]
[1:47:56] home.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Verse three,
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; I'm tired
[1:48:04] of sin
[1:48:06] and strain.
[1:48:09] Now I'm coming
[1:48:14] home. [music]
[1:48:18] I'll trust thy love
[1:48:22] and believe thy word,
[1:48:26] Lord.
[1:48:28] I'm coming
[1:48:31] home.
[1:48:33] Verse four,
[1:48:35] my soul is sick [music]
[1:48:39] and heart is
[1:48:44] now.
[1:48:46] I'm coming
[1:48:48] home.
[1:48:53] My strength renew.
[1:49:01] Oh Lord, [music] I'm coming [singing]
[1:49:05] home.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Coming home, Lord.
[1:49:10] Come,
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Lord. I come home.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; I just want to walk close with you,
[1:49:26] Lord.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Open
[1:49:29] wide. Open wide the arms of love
[1:49:34] [singing]
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; just desire to walk closer to you.
[1:49:42] Coming home, Father.
[1:49:44] Coming
[1:49:46] home.
[1:49:49] Coming.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Never [music and singing]
[1:49:57] to
[1:50:02] open
[1:50:06] arms
[1:50:08] of love,
[1:50:10] Lord.
[1:50:18] Like that prodical son.
[1:50:21] Why shall I stay in that state? I am
[1:50:25] when my father is a house.
[1:50:28] I can come home. Why shall I take food
[1:50:32] from pigs pig's food?
[1:50:35] Why not just go home to my father?
[1:50:39] And sure indeed the father was there
[1:50:42] his arms wide open
[1:50:45] to receive him.
[1:50:48] He did not judge him. He did not go
[1:50:51] through all history. You made the wrong
[1:50:53] decision there. You see you are paying
[1:50:54] it off now.
[1:50:56] I say my son come.
[1:51:00] I've been waiting for you for so many
[1:51:02] years.
[1:51:03] I knew you'll come back. Why don't you
[1:51:06] come?
[1:51:08] That invitation we had this morning.
[1:51:12] Oh my son, my daughter,
[1:51:15] maybe you have been through many
[1:51:16] negativity. Why don't you come home?
[1:51:20] I'm your open my arms wide open for you
[1:51:24] to receive you and to walk with you.
[1:51:28] And we respond with Father, we come.
[1:51:31] Maybe you have been Christians for many
[1:51:33] years. Yes, that's good.
[1:51:36] But don't give up. Stay calm. Walk with
[1:51:39] me. Walk with me closer.
[1:51:43] Give me your heart.
[1:51:46] Feed feed feed the white dog with more
[1:51:48] food. The right food.
[1:51:51] Confession of the word of God. Maybe
[1:51:53] give God a little bit more time.
[1:51:56] Oh Lord, I I today I make a decision to
[1:51:58] serve you faithfully.
[1:52:01] Lord, I want to challenge you on your
[1:52:03] own word to take you at your word.
[1:52:05] Father, I just want to to make a
[1:52:08] decision. There is a power of decision.
[1:52:09] The prophet preached power decision. But
[1:52:12] this morning, Lord,
[1:52:15] Lord, I just want to live an overcoming
[1:52:18] life, a closer walk with you, Father.
[1:52:21] Not to complain, not to murmur, not to
[1:52:24] look at the negative [music] things, not
[1:52:27] to nurture animosity or jealousy or or
[1:52:30] envy or hatred of try to make the other
[1:52:34] one look bad or the other things,
[1:52:36] Father. But let me create around me the
[1:52:39] atmosphere of love, atmosphere of
[1:52:42] praise, atmosphere of thanksgiving.
[1:52:45] Lord, I'm coming home. I'm coming. I'm
[1:52:48] sick and tired of negativity and
[1:52:51] frustrations and and battles and fight
[1:52:54] and all those different things. Father,
[1:52:57] oh God, I put all the burdens at your
[1:53:00] feet. Give me that rest. Give me that

[2:03:30] Let's have a word of prayer.
[2:03:33] Heavenly Father, we want to thank you
[2:03:35] this afternoon.
[2:03:37] Indeed, we bless your name.
[2:03:40] When we were coming here, we came with
[2:03:42] expectation
[2:03:44] and we know within our hearts that Lord,
[2:03:46] you have met our expectation.
[2:03:49] We want to thank you Lord.
[2:03:52] Maybe there was one person that you
[2:03:56] needed to speak to
[2:03:59] and we are happy that Lord you spoken to
[2:04:01] that person.
[2:04:03] We bless your name. Want to thank you
[2:04:07] Lord. We commit ourselves into your
[2:04:09] hands. We acknowledge the weakness in us
[2:04:13] that Lord there is nothing that we can
[2:04:16] do but we know that Lord you went to the
[2:04:19] cross. You nailed all our weaknesses.
[2:04:24] You given us the strength to overcome.
[2:04:27] Lord, you fought the battle for us. And
[2:04:29] you said that we are more than
[2:04:31] overcomers.
[2:04:34] The only thing we need to do is to make
[2:04:37] a decision to walk with you. The power
[2:04:40] of decision is in our hands. Joshua
[2:04:42] said, "For me and my household, we will
[2:04:46] worship the Lord."
[2:04:48] We are also making a decision this
[2:04:50] morning that we want to follow through.
[2:04:52] It doesn't matter what happens, Lord. We
[2:04:54] are not turning back because we know
[2:04:56] that there's nothing good out there.
[2:05:00] There is nothing good out there. The
[2:05:03] world is crumbling. Everything is
[2:05:05] turning bad.
[2:05:07] And we are making a decision Lord to
[2:05:09] follow you. Give us the strength to
[2:05:12] progress. Give us the strength to fight
[2:05:15] this battle.
[2:05:17] We know that the devil is there
[2:05:20] but everything that happens to us is to
[2:05:23] give us unexpected end.
[2:05:26] We are asking for your grace Lord. Even
[2:05:28] as we leave here we are asking that Lord
[2:05:31] may you go with us.
[2:05:33] May we ponder over this word and we know
[2:05:36] that every problem is nothing
[2:05:38] insountable. We can overcome every
[2:05:40] problem. We commit the church into your
[2:05:43] hands, the pastor, everybody into your
[2:05:45] hands. Take absolute control of our
[2:05:47] lives and lead us, Lord. And if there be
[2:05:50] a time next week, we'll come back and we
[2:05:53] give you all the glory and honor. May
[2:05:55] you go with us. In the name of the Lord
[2:05:57] Jesus Christ, we pray with thanksgiving.
[2:05:59] Amen.

[2:06:46] his power. So I will count God's
