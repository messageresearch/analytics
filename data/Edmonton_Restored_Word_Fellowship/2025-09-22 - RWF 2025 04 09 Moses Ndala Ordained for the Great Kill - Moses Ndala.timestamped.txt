[2:24] on the messaging app there and I was
[2:26] just thankful. It was the best of a
[2:29] worse situation. So, Adeline was okay
[2:32] and I was okay and there was no other
[2:34] vehicles on the road when I hit it and
[2:37] my airbags didn't go off which would
[2:38] have veered me somewhere and yeah and so
[2:41] everything was okay and I'm sorry I
[2:43] missed Sunday. I had to drive um drove
[2:46] all the way to left bridge to try and
[2:47] find parts of my car. I don't have
[2:48] collision on my car. So, I'm fixing it
[2:50] myself. So, so I have enough to make it
[2:53] roadw worthy. And praise the Lord, it's
[2:55] roadw worthy.
[2:57] I just have a a bunch of doors that are
[2:59] just all dented. So,
[3:03] let's sing 842. Keep on the firing line.
[3:12] If you're in the battle for the Lord and

[3:18] keep on the firing line.
[3:24] If you'll win, my brother, surely you
[3:27] must fight.
[3:29] Keep on the firing line.
[3:35] There are many dangers that we all must
[3:39] face.
[3:40] If we die of fighting, there is no
[3:44] disgrace.
[3:46] A coward in the service, he will find no
[3:50] place. So keep on the firing line.
[3:56] You must fight. Be brave against all
[4:01] evil.
[4:03] Never run or even lag behind
[4:08] if you would win for God and the right.
[4:13] Just keep on the firing line.
[4:19] God will only use a soldier he can
[4:22] trust.
[4:24] Keep on the firing line.
[4:30] If you wear a crown, then bear the
[4:32] cross. You must
[4:35] keep on the firing line.
[4:40] Life is but to labor for the master,
[4:44] dear.
[4:45] Help to banish evil and to spread good
[4:49] cheer.
[4:51] Great you'll be rewarded for your
[4:53] service here. So keep on the firing
[4:58] line.
[5:00] You must fight. Be brave against all
[5:05] evil. Never run or even lag behind.
[5:12] If you would win for God and the right,
[5:16] just keep on the firing line.
[5:22] When we get to heaven, brother, we'll be
[5:26] glad.
[5:27] Keep on the firing line.
[5:33] How will we praise the Savior for the
[5:35] call we had?
[5:38] Keep on the firing line.
[5:43] When we see the souls that we have
[5:46] helped to win,
[5:48] leading them to Jesus from the paths of
[5:52] sin,
[5:53] with a shout of welcome, we will all

[6:38] have.
[6:39] Keep on the firing line

[12:06] [Music]
[12:07] tomorrow.
[12:09] We can keep brother Dan in our prayers.
[12:12] Um maybe if I ask brother Fox if he
[12:14] could come up and and open pray for the
[12:18] Pray for brother Dan Bamford.
[12:22] You can sing that one more time. What a
[12:25] wonderful thing. A wonderful thing to be
[12:30] saved from sin. Have peace within to be
[12:35] made anointed with Jesus my king. What a
[12:41] wonderful wonderful thing.
[12:47] [Music]
[12:50] God bless you. It's good to be in God's
[12:53] house again.
[12:56] No better place for a Christian to be is
[12:57] right here tonight to come to
[13:01] fellowship with our Lord and Savior, the
[13:02] one that gave us eternal life through
[13:05] his precious blood.
[13:07] Um I just like to share a couple of
[13:09] things before we go into prayer. Um
[13:12] I was uh found uh brother Luke Sim. He's
[13:17] uh I think he's scheduled to go in for
[13:19] an operation, I believe he has a donor
[13:22] for a liver
[13:24] and if it's if the liver is
[13:27] uncompromised and he's a fit for it,
[13:31] apparently he'll be going in for an
[13:33] operation tomorrow. Uh but don't quote
[13:36] me on that. I just heard that. I was
[13:38] texting brother Ray Adrian tonight and
[13:40] it's sounding good right now, but you
[13:42] know, things can change, right? So, we
[13:44] just want to trust in the Lord and keep
[13:46] the whole family in prayer that uh if it
[13:48] does come to pass that he has his
[13:50] operation and that uh that uh our Lord
[13:53] will just intervene in that operating
[13:55] room and and uh just work with everybody
[13:57] involved to to put a new liver in him.
[13:59] Even even so, uh it takes God to come on
[14:04] the scene and do the healing. And I was
[14:06] also talking to uh brother David
[14:08] Hakaluck. Um I see him quite often
[14:11] because he comes to my club and I'm
[14:12] coaching him. So I'm keeping in touch
[14:14] with him with his his brother uh Johnny
[14:17] and uh he's basically fighting for his
[14:19] life and uh the doctors have given him
[14:22] six months to live. You know he needs a
[14:25] miracle. Um he's uh he's not keen keen
[14:29] on taking chemotherapy
[14:31] uh because at the best even with the
[14:34] chemotherapy the doctor said there's
[14:35] only maybe 50/50 chance that he'd make
[14:38] it through chemotherapy.
[14:41] So uh he's opted for the option to try a
[14:44] holistic view point of view of taking
[14:46] natural medicine and he's doing that and
[14:50] uh so he's apparently he went and saw
[14:53] another doctor another specialist and
[14:55] that doctor recommended he should take
[14:56] both both the natural approach and to
[14:59] take chemo.
[15:01] And there again, um it all comes down to
[15:04] um his trust and faith in the Lord and
[15:07] that uh it'll raise his faith up to
[15:10] accept what God will have for him. Uh
[15:12] he's pretty low. He's very weak. He he
[15:14] he's uh he can't drive anymore. He's
[15:18] pretty much on full care. Um so pray for
[15:22] the Hakalak family and uh just pray that
[15:25] God would have his will and wait tonight
[15:26] in this meeting. and uh we just want to
[15:29] give him all the praise. So let's go in
[15:31] prayer for before our Lord. Heavenly
[15:33] Father, Lord, we just really want to
[15:35] thank you this evening, Lord, that
[15:36] you've given us the opportunity again
[15:39] one more time, dear Lord, just to come
[15:40] into your house, Lord, just to spend
[15:43] time with you, Lord, just to take away
[15:44] the cares of this world, Lord, that
[15:46] we're living in. And Father, that we
[15:48] come here tonight for one purpose only.
[15:50] And that purpose is, Lord Jesus, just to
[15:52] get closer to you, Father God. And
[15:55] Father, Lord, just forgive us where
[15:56] we've fallen short today. Maybe Lord
[15:58] Jesus, we just want to commit everything
[16:00] to you tonight in this service, the song
[16:02] service, the song later. Lord, a brother
[16:04] that would step behind this pulpit
[16:06] tonight, Lord, preach the word of God.
[16:08] May we just pull on that gift, Lord
[16:10] Jesus. Father, just bind us together in
[16:12] one accord and one spirit, Lord Jesus,
[16:15] for our desire and our prayer, Lord
[16:17] Jesus, that we leave here a better
[16:18] people than we come in, Lord Jesus. Lord
[16:21] Jesus, that our light would just shine
[16:22] for you, oh Father God, for this is the
[16:24] reason and purpose we're here on earth,
[16:26] Father, just to be a shining light for
[16:28] that one lost soul. And Lord, I'm sure
[16:30] there's many unspoken requests out there
[16:32] for families and loved ones. And I sure
[16:34] have my family and my and I'm just I'm
[16:37] just claiming them, Lord Jesus. Lord,
[16:39] that you would just intercede in that
[16:41] and my family, Lord Jesus. And all
[16:43] things are possible, Lord Jesus, through
[16:45] you. We just want to put our trust in
[16:47] you tonight, Lord Jesus. and just want
[16:48] to give you all the glory and the honor
[16:50] and praise your wonderful precious name
[16:52] we pray. Amen.

[32:20] Father. Lord, that's why we are here,
[32:22] Lord. We love you and appreciate you. We

[32:28] Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen.
[32:33] Amen.
[32:35] A little up. Yeah, sure. Thank you.
[32:41] Thank you. Thank you pastor. Greet you
[32:44] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[32:45] evening. Amen. And u
[32:50] keep you a li good habit to keep you
[32:53] standing
[32:55] makes you uh awake. Keeps you awake.
[33:00] Wednesday sometimes you feel tired and
[33:02] we've been doing different things during
[33:04] the day. So but you know sometimes we
[33:07] are tired as we allowed oursel to be
[33:09] tired. Sometimes sometimes if they put
[33:13] something here that you like is some
[33:14] people like hockey if they put hockey
[33:17] you forget about tiredness.
[33:20] So jumping and everything. So sometimes
[33:22] just ourel allowing to be tired but we
[33:26] we also respect genuine tiredness but
[33:29] may God help us. Amen. The prophet says
[33:32] uh I want to to go to the word of God
[33:33] but I just want to read this quote. Oh,
[33:37] it seems condemning, but I just liked
[33:39] it. I just found it almost when I was
[33:41] preparing towards the end. I said, "Oh,
[33:43] that's that looks a good quote. Christ
[33:45] is a mystery of God revealed." It says,
[33:48] "You've got tapes on discipline in the
[33:50] church, how we behave oursel in the
[33:53] church, how we got to come here together
[33:55] and sit together in heavenly places."
[33:57] Say, "Don't stay home." Oh, looks like
[34:00] we should say for those who stayed home,
[34:02] but they're talking to us. Don't stay
[34:04] home. If God is in your heart, you can't
[34:07] hardly wait for them doors to open out
[34:10] your handle to get in here to fellowship
[34:12] with your brothers. If you don't feel
[34:15] that way, then I tell you, it's time for
[34:18] you, you got to go to praying.
[34:21] May God help us. Amen. Oh, we have that
[34:24] desire where we want to come to church
[34:26] and have fellowship with one another and
[34:28] fellowship around the revealed word of
[34:30] the hour. Amen. Judges 16
[34:34] going to talk about some sum. Thank you
[34:36] musicians and thank you brother Andrew.
[34:38] Amen.
[34:40] We are happy that you are here. God
[34:43] bless you. Thank you for keeping you and
[34:45] watching over you and the family. Great
[34:49] testimony of God's protection and his
[34:52] presence. Amen. We're happy for Sister
[34:55] Esther who's also back. She's not in the
[34:56] service yet. I think she jet lag or so.
[35:00] Uh but she will recover. She will
[35:04] recover. So God bless her. Um
[35:09] happy that she's here.
[35:12] Judges 16.
[35:22] Judge 16 verse 2022.
[35:30] Judges 16 verse 20. And she said is
[35:33] Delilah. Delilah said, "The Philistine
[35:36] be upon thee, Samson." And he woke out
[35:39] of his sleep and said, "I will go out as
[35:43] at the other times before and shake
[35:47] myself." And he whis not that the Lord
[35:50] had departed from him. Oh my. But the
[35:54] the Philistines took him and put out his
[35:56] eyes and brought him down to Gaza and
[35:59] bound him with feathers of brass. And he
[36:02] did grind in the prison house. It did
[36:05] grind in the prison house. May God bless
[36:08] his word. And you can have a seat.
[36:19] Like I said, I would like to talk a
[36:20] little bit of Samsson um as a thought
[36:23] just for this uh small thought to share
[36:26] for the prayer meeting.
[36:28] Hebrews 11:32 says,
[36:31] "And what shall I say more? For the time
[36:34] will fail me to tell of Gideon and of
[36:36] Barack and of of Samson, of Jeffy, of
[36:39] David also and Samuel and of the
[36:41] prophet." So Samson was not was
[36:45] considered as one of the heroes of
[36:47] faith. Amen. Even though we know at the
[36:49] end it seemed like a little bit was
[36:51] beaten or but it was a hero of faith.
[36:53] Amen. It was an example but it was put
[36:56] there for for as a type. It was put
[36:57] there as a as some something where we
[37:00] can learn from as a principle where we
[37:02] can learn from. So that's why is there
[37:03] in the Bible
[37:05] is a type of the church. The prophet
[37:07] will use it as a type of the church to
[37:09] preach some messages. a deceived church
[37:11] by the world or just once more and
[37:14] different messages to show a parallel
[37:16] between Samson and the church. Amen. So
[37:19] look at the life of Samson. We see that
[37:21] it represent the church. Samson was born
[37:23] with a mission. Samson was born with a
[37:26] mission. He was born with a purpose. He
[37:29] had a mission to kill the Philistines.
[37:31] That was his mission. But because they
[37:33] were under bondage, he was he was there
[37:35] to kill them. He was born in order to
[37:37] deliver them from the Philistines. The
[37:40] church also had a commission. The church
[37:42] has a commission to deliver to kill uh
[37:44] to to to kill the enemy if we can do to
[37:46] the works of the enemy to continue the
[37:49] works of the law to destroy the works of
[37:51] the enemy. Amen. Yes, sir. The Bible
[37:54] says in 1 John 3 says, "He that committh
[37:57] sin is of the devil, and the devil
[37:59] sinnth from the beginning, but the
[38:01] purpose of the son of God was manifest
[38:04] that he might destroy the works of the
[38:06] devil." Amen. We are not here just to be
[38:09] on the to be the one receiving the
[38:12] pushing the the punch the punch from the
[38:14] devil. We are not here just to be there
[38:17] on the on the side where the devil can
[38:19] throw anything at us and we are just oh
[38:21] he was just defending trying to to do
[38:23] this way. We are also also on the side
[38:26] where we can also defend our land and
[38:28] also show to the devil that this is our
[38:31] possession. We can claim our
[38:33] inheritance. Solomon, Samson was there
[38:37] to claim the inheritance that God has
[38:39] already given them. This cannot be
[38:41] pertaining to the Philistines. You have
[38:44] to fight for it. You have to put them
[38:46] away. You have to defend your land. You
[38:48] have to defend your family. You have to
[38:51] defend your church. Amen. You have to
[38:53] defend the message. Amen. We are here to
[38:56] defend our inheritance. Amen. We cannot
[38:59] just be there and be accepting anything
[39:01] that comes from the enemy. We are there
[39:02] to defend what God has given us. Amen.
[39:04] God has given us the joy of salvation. I
[39:07] have to defend the joy of salvation. God
[39:09] has given healing. I have to defend
[39:11] healing. God has given have given me
[39:14] sanctification. I have to defend
[39:15] sanctification. He has given them the
[39:17] Holy Ghost. I have to defend the Holy
[39:19] Ghost. Amen. Confessing what God has
[39:23] told me. Amen.
[39:25] The prophet says in the spoken words the
[39:27] original seed he says now Christ was
[39:29] manifested to destroy the works of the
[39:32] devil. You believe that? Now I can't
[39:34] explain all this. I'm just going through
[39:36] just quickly hit the high places so you
[39:38] can't stay too long. The prophet says
[39:40] Christ was manifested to destroy the
[39:42] works of the devil. Is that right? The
[39:44] congregation says amen. You all believe
[39:47] that. That's why it says God's word
[39:49] which destroys the works of the hybrid,
[39:52] the devil. Is that right? He was done to
[39:54] do that. He was born to to be that to
[39:57] destroy the works of the devil. Now his
[40:00] body is to do the same because the body
[40:03] is or head or body is together. That's
[40:06] right. If Christ is the head was the
[40:08] word, his body has to be the same thing
[40:12] as his head was. Amen. The church of the
[40:15] word, born of the word, virgin born from
[40:18] the word. No denimation now. Virgin born
[40:21] from the word. The way the body operates
[40:23] is by the head. Is the head was there to
[40:26] destroy the works of the enemy. So the
[40:29] body must also be there to destroy the
[40:31] works of the enemy. Amen. We are here to
[40:34] destroy the works of the enemy. So Satan
[40:37] was ordained Satan Samson was ordained
[40:41] to to to to ordained for the great kill.
[40:44] Amen. Son
[40:47] was ordained for the great kill. You
[40:50] have not been ordained to live under
[40:52] your privileges. You have been ordained
[40:55] to cast the enemy and to take your
[40:57] inheritance of the promised land of God.
[41:02] Healing is ours. Joy, salvation is ours.
[41:04] Sanctification is ours. Full service for
[41:07] God is ours. Amen. Our marriage is ours.
[41:10] Our family is ours. Amen. Our church is
[41:13] ours. We have to claim all of them.
[41:15] Amen. Because of what God has given us.
[41:17] We are sons and daughters of God. Amen.
[41:20] We are not slaves. We are not servant.
[41:22] We are sons and daughters of God. Once
[41:24] you have received the Holy Ghost, you
[41:26] have the token to claim your family. You
[41:29] have the token to claim your belongings.
[41:31] You have the token to claim your h your
[41:33] health. Amen. Amen. Amen. Samson was
[41:38] predestinated to life. He was announced
[41:41] by the angel way before he was even
[41:44] conceived.
[41:46] The angel came and told them the the
[41:48] mother says you know you shall have a
[41:50] son that son has to be dedicated to me
[41:52] make sure that you don't drink any wine
[41:54] you don't drink any alcohol you don't
[41:56] drink anything because that son has been
[41:58] dedicated to me in order to fight the
[42:01] enemy has been dedicated
[42:12] in this age you shall the I will send
[42:16] you I will send you Elijah the prophet
[42:19] that Malachi 4 concerns you concerns me
[42:21] amen we are part of the prophecy we have
[42:24] been ordained for the great kill we have
[42:26] been ordained to defeat the enemy
[42:30] that's right
[42:34] prophet says that the only one thing I
[42:37] find with the Christian church today it
[42:39] a scare or it's being afraid it backs up
[42:42] it doesn't understand its privileges is
[42:45] we are living far under the privileges
[42:47] that God has for then for us to live. We
[42:50] are now not will be but now we are now
[42:53] are you the sons and daughters of God
[42:56] and and we try to put it in the
[42:58] millennium somewhere but now you are now
[43:01] that you have to exercise your
[43:04] privileges of being son and daughter of
[43:06] God. We should not be living under fear.
[43:09] Fear of cancer, fear of this, fear of
[43:11] this, fear of this. Both things exist,
[43:13] but we are sons and daughters of God.
[43:16] God is more powerful than anything that
[43:18] the enemy can put upon us.
[43:22] The prophet says in perfect faith when
[43:25] we were sinners alenated without God in
[43:28] the world in that mark of man as I
[43:31] talked about this morning, God come to
[43:34] us. God sought you. God sought you. You
[43:37] never sought God. No man can come to me
[43:40] except the father draws him first. Amen.
[43:43] We didn't when not looking for God. We
[43:45] are not seeking the message. We are not
[43:47] looking for the message. We didn't even
[43:49] know that the message was there. But the
[43:52] God God reach in reach in mercy. Looked
[43:55] for you. Looked for me. Was seeking for
[43:57] you like that eagle was looking to find.
[44:00] I know my son is there. I know my
[44:02] daughter is there. I will send a book.
[44:04] I'll testify. I will send someone to
[44:05] testify that person. I will bring them
[44:07] in the church. Amen. God is the one who
[44:10] was seeking after us. We are not seeking
[44:12] after him. So if God was seeking after
[44:15] you, after me. He has a purpose for it.
[44:17] Amen.
[44:19] Amen. Prophet says, "No man can come to
[44:21] me except the father draws him first."
[44:25] Amen. That's a wonderful scripture. Be
[44:28] it is the father who draws you. Amen.
[44:30] It's the father who who brings you to
[44:32] him. We didn't bring oursel. We didn't
[44:35] know. We didn't even we didn't know
[44:36] anything. Amen. We were we were say we
[44:39] were we were we were suffering of
[44:41] spiritual amnesia.
[44:43] We didn't know where we were. But by
[44:46] God's grace, he put us in a he put us in
[44:48] a in a way that we we start remembering
[44:51] something. He put us in a way where we
[44:53] stop at the station. We go there. Oh,
[44:55] this reminds me of something. This
[44:57] reminds me of something. This reminds me
[44:59] of something. When they talk about the
[45:01] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ, oh,
[45:03] just something says amen. You don't
[45:05] understand but you say amen. When they
[45:07] talk about the prophet and the prophet
[45:09] God has sent a prophet just in your
[45:10] heart something says amen. It was God
[45:13] drawing you to him. God drawing me to
[45:16] him.
[45:18] Hallelujah. Amen. Says God came down in
[45:21] that mark where you were and sought you
[45:24] out and brought you out. That ought to
[45:26] create a perfect love. Look what you
[45:29] were. Look what you are today. What did
[45:33] that? somebody that loves you. Can't you
[45:36] have faith in what God has promised you?
[45:38] Then real genuine love will create a
[45:41] confidence in his word. Sometimes the
[45:44] problem is love. God, may you give us
[45:46] more of your love. Because if I love you
[45:49] so much, I know that you love me
[45:51] already. There's nothing I can do to
[45:53] make you love me more. Amen. Because
[45:55] God's love is elective. He's already
[45:58] elected you. Already chosen you. Now we
[46:00] ask to love him more. Amen. to express
[46:02] our love to him more and more. The more
[46:05] we love him, the more we trust him. Love
[46:07] creates faith. Amen. Love creates faith.
[46:10] You love the Lord so much if you have
[46:12] faith in his word. Amen. That's true.
[46:14] That's why in order to go on the other
[46:16] side, we need perfect faith. Perfect
[46:18] love. God, may you give us more of your
[46:20] love. Amen.
[46:23] It says, "He caught me when I was
[46:25] nothing. I'm still nothing, but I am in
[46:27] his hand." See, he caught me. And he
[46:31] loved me when I was unlovable.
[46:34] He loved you when you were unlovable,
[46:36] but he changed you. Amen. Just like that
[46:40] sister said that time in her testimony.
[46:42] She said, "I'm not what I ought to be."
[46:44] Yeah, that true. That's why we come to
[46:46] church. That's why we read the word of
[46:48] God. We listen to the tapes. That's why
[46:50] we we pray because we realize we are not
[46:53] there yet where we had to be. We had to
[46:56] come to that perfect perfect love the
[46:58] capstone that that's why we reach that's
[47:00] where we are aiming that's where we want
[47:02] to go. Amen. That's why we we we we we
[47:05] pray that's why we dedicate ourselves.
[47:07] Lord I want to reach there. I want to
[47:09] get there. I want to come to the point
[47:11] where I can forgive. I can come to a
[47:13] point where I can love anyone. I want to
[47:15] come to the point where no nothing can
[47:17] hurt me and I cannot hurt anybody. I
[47:20] want to reach that statue of the perfect
[47:21] man. I want to come to the level where
[47:24] Lord I can hear your voice that any time
[47:26] I've been led Lord I don't want to rely
[47:29] on my own understanding. I want to come
[47:30] to the level where you are like with the
[47:32] prophet I'm waiting for you to lead me.
[47:34] Amen. Amen. Amen. Because there are many
[47:38] things in the channel sometimes many
[47:40] things logging the pres or or the talk
[47:42] or the communion with God. Now we want
[47:44] all those channels to be cleansed to be
[47:46] removed to come to that perfect such a
[47:49] perfect man.
[47:51] So I'm not what I ought to be,
[47:54] but I'm not what I want to be. I know
[47:56] I'm not what I want to be, but I'm not
[47:58] what I used to be. That's the
[48:00] difference. I used to be the one who
[48:02] loved alcohol. I used to be the one who
[48:04] loved the world. I used to be the one
[48:05] who all the different things. But
[48:07] something changed me. I did not change
[48:09] myself. Something changed me. There is
[48:12] only one thing that can remove the
[48:13] desire is the Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost has
[48:16] the power to remove the desire. God, you
[48:19] have removed the desire. If you could
[48:22] remove the desire for the things of the
[48:23] world, now today, I know you will bring
[48:26] me to perfection. Amen. Because God does
[48:28] not do a partial work. Amen. God doesn't
[48:31] start a project and it stays in the
[48:33] middle of the project. No, that's not
[48:35] how God works. When God start a work, he
[48:38] he continue all the way to full
[48:40] completion.
[48:43] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[48:47] He says
[48:49] she know that she had come somewhere
[48:51] something happened. That's the way it
[48:53] is. If God when I was an alien from him
[48:56] so loved me till he stooped down to get
[48:59] me and picked me up that gives me
[49:01] confidence that that he wants to use me.
[49:04] Amen. Amen. He's got the purpose in
[49:07] doing it. He seen something in me. He
[49:10] seen something in you. He had a reason
[49:12] to save you. Look at the people that are
[49:15] unsaved today. Sometimes we we we look
[49:18] only at the negative side sometimes,
[49:20] right? So this I'm still this. I'm this
[49:23] and this. I'm still this. But the
[49:25] prophet says no. Sometimes look look
[49:27] from all the unsaved people there. But
[49:29] God saved you. God chose you. God
[49:32] revealed his word to you. Amen. God
[49:34] forgave your sins. God tell you you are
[49:37] justified as if you have never done it
[49:39] to begin with. From all the people, God
[49:41] tells you that. Oh God, it should give
[49:43] us more confidence. It should give us
[49:45] more love towards him. Should give us to
[49:47] understand that we have been called for
[49:50] a purpose. Amen. God reveal to us your
[49:53] purpose. The purpose sometimes might not
[49:55] be a big things and to become a big man
[49:58] or a big woman. The purpose might be
[50:00] just oh to say amen to the church. In
[50:02] the church I share sometimes with my
[50:04] wife. I says, "Oh, I thank God for
[50:06] brother Bryant in in the tapes." Is it
[50:08] Brent, right? Brent. Bryant. Yeah. We
[50:10] ran in the tape and some the tape
[50:13] sometimes will be so you know if he was
[50:16] not there but God put him there just to
[50:19] say amen.
[50:21] Oh that makes the tapes lively.
[50:24] Thank God for that brother. Amen. Maybe
[50:27] God just call you for that purpose.
[50:28] Amen.
[50:30] That's right. Amen.
[50:33] Amen. I like that.
[50:38] says, "No one can take your place." No
[50:41] one can take your place. Amen. No one
[50:45] can take your place. Amen. You are in
[50:47] God's economy. Sometimes think, "No, I'm
[50:49] just a little one. I'm just nothing
[50:51] here." And no, you are part of God's
[50:54] economy. Amen. That's why if you
[50:56] understand it, oh God, help me to play
[50:59] my part. Help me to play my part fully.
[51:02] Lord, whatever you want me to be, help
[51:04] me to be on my post of duty because I'm
[51:06] part of God's economy. If I'm not there,
[51:09] I'm making God's economy incomplete.
[51:11] Amen. And you can never be successful.
[51:14] The Bible say at some point I might not
[51:16] get reached. Say you can never be
[51:17] successful or you can never be you.
[51:19] There are only two things either you
[51:21] fulfill God purpose in your life or you
[51:23] will be the most miserable person in
[51:25] your life. Oh God, I would like to be
[51:28] the I would like to be fulfilling God
[51:30] purpose than to be miserable. Amen.
[51:33] You can never find satisfaction, real
[51:36] satisfaction until you come to the real
[51:38] place where God called you. Amen. You
[51:41] are part of God's economy. No one can do
[51:44] it. That is love to you. Amen. Then
[51:47] won't your love won't won't your love
[51:49] reach back to him? If there is there and
[51:52] there is a love affair no matter what
[51:54] the situation is it circumstances is
[51:57] governed by this love that create faith
[51:59] that God loves you and you love God and
[52:02] you love one another and that brings
[52:04] faith. Amen. It can't keep from bringing
[52:07] out just exactly what it can't keep from
[52:10] bringing out just exactly what God
[52:13] promised it it will be. Amen. So each
[52:16] one of us has a purpose. Yes. Amen.
[52:19] Samson was a Nazarite from his mother's
[52:21] womb. The the angel told the mother
[52:23] said, "Therefore be aware I pray thee.
[52:25] Drink not wine nor stream drink and hear
[52:28] and eat not any unclean thing for no th
[52:31] shall conceive and bear a son and no
[52:33] razor shall come into his head. For the
[52:36] child shall be a Nazarite unto God from
[52:38] the womb, and he shall begin to deliver
[52:39] Israel out of the hand of the
[52:41] Philistines." You know what a Nazarite
[52:44] he is? He is the one who has to be
[52:45] consecrated. has to be dedicated. That's
[52:47] why we are we we are dedicated to God.
[52:50] We we don't we don't compromise on the
[52:52] word on God's word. We don't go and and
[52:54] drink wine and do a different things and
[52:57] and be there on unclean things. We are
[52:59] Nazarite dedicated to God. Consecrated
[53:01] to God. A life that is consecrated,
[53:04] sanctified, undeiled. Amen. God cannot
[53:07] use any any person who's not a Nazarite.
[53:10] Amen. We have to be a Nazerite. The
[53:12] sister have to keep the long hair as a
[53:14] sign of Nazarite. Amen. Submission. What
[53:16] is part? You are a Nazerite. Amen. The
[53:19] prophet said, "A Christian is a Nazerite
[53:21] is separated from the things of the
[53:23] world." Amen. We are Nazarite. Amen.
[53:26] Listen. Because we want to be used by
[53:28] God for the purpose he called us to do.
[53:30] Amen. To be a Nazerite means you make an
[53:34] effort to keep yourself.
[53:36] You make an effort to keep yourself. You
[53:39] run away from dead people, dead things.
[53:41] You run away from women. You run away
[53:43] from from things on the website. You run
[53:46] away. You You keep yourself clean.
[53:48] That's a Nazarite. He had to make that
[53:50] effort. Amen. To make sure I'm dedicated
[53:52] to God. Amen. I'm sanctified.
[53:56] True. Amen. Samson, when he saw the
[54:00] lion, I'm just going quickly because I
[54:01] want to say I don't want to be too long.
[54:03] The spirit of the Lord came upon him
[54:05] mighty upon him and he ran him. He ran
[54:08] the lion and he ran him. He rent him and
[54:12] he rent him as he would have rent a kid
[54:14] and he had nothing in his hand but he
[54:16] told not his father and his mother what
[54:18] he had done. The prophet will pick the
[54:20] scripture and many other places he says
[54:22] Samson was not a big full of muscles and
[54:25] different things. No that's how
[54:28] Hollywood is trying to represent Samson.
[54:31] Samson was not big and full of muscles.
[54:34] He was just a simple man. A simple man.
[54:39] Just a simple man like that. But when
[54:41] the spirit of God comes upon him, then
[54:44] he can do the great works. Amen. He's a
[54:47] type of the church. The church is not
[54:50] maybe different from the other churches.
[54:51] May have a simple building and but when
[54:54] the Holy Spirit comes in that church,
[54:56] that makes the difference. Amen.
[54:59] Praise be to God. Amen. So that was the
[55:02] mystery. He was a CC boy. He was a ce a
[55:05] little cece man. And people look how
[55:08] where is the secret of that man? We
[55:10] don't see any different. He was a
[55:13] Nazerite. He was not the only Nazerite.
[55:15] There are many Nazerite in the country.
[55:17] They had the long hair the same way as
[55:19] him. But him this strength is different.
[55:22] Where does it come from? Everybody was
[55:24] wondering how can someone take a line
[55:26] and and and just kill him in in pieces
[55:29] like that. This must be something
[55:30] different. What's going on? How can a
[55:32] man run after 300 foxes? Can you think
[55:35] about it? 300 foxes. They go in a
[55:38] different direction and he goes, he
[55:39] catch this one, he catch this one, he
[55:41] catch this 300 and tie them together.
[55:44] That must be something really wonderful.
[55:48] So they know this man cannot only be
[55:51] supernatural. Not a man can do that. Not
[55:54] a man, not a simple man can do that. So
[55:56] we have to find where the secret is.
[55:58] This they must have something different.
[56:01] Indeed, he had a hidden power inside of
[56:03] him. That was the Holy Spirit. That the
[56:05] spirit of God when it comes upon him, he
[56:08] changed him completely. He gave him that
[56:10] supernatural power. Amen. The same thing
[56:13] for the church. Amen. We have received
[56:16] the supernatural power of God to change
[56:19] us, to transform us. Amen. Amen. That's
[56:22] right. That's what makes the bride
[56:24] special. Amen.
[56:26] So the success of the world is not our
[56:28] success. The success of the bride is
[56:31] depending upon the Holy Spirit. We
[56:35] cannot compare with the world. Amen. We
[56:37] cannot compare to the program of the
[56:38] world. We cannot compare. The prophet
[56:40] will take that down the evil world
[56:41] church says we cannot compare even
[56:43] pattern after the world and the company
[56:45] and all the things they do. We have to
[56:48] rely on what God has done. We see some
[56:50] in the Christian music. We have to rely
[56:52] on what God has done. Amen. Amen.
[56:59] At one time, you see, he takes a you
[57:01] know the story of of of Samson just just
[57:03] read. He take a dry jawbone of a NAS and
[57:06] killed 1,000 fully armored soldiers. You
[57:10] know that was not the problem. Pick it
[57:12] out. That was not the what? That was not
[57:14] the strength of Samson. That could not
[57:16] be the strength of a man. Even that
[57:18] jawbone that he had in his hand, it was
[57:21] already dry. The first heat would have
[57:23] crushed it. Amen. But when God, the
[57:25] spirit of God came, he used that that
[57:29] dry job on. Amen. If you have sometimes
[57:32] you what God has given you, God has
[57:35] given you a little a little slingshot of
[57:37] prayer. Don't neglect it. Amen. If God
[57:40] comes behind it, he has the power to
[57:42] remove what the enemy is trying to
[57:44] attack you. He has the power to
[57:46] stabilize our families. He has the power
[57:48] to give us healing. Amen. He has the
[57:51] power to give us the joy of the
[57:52] salvation. He has the power to give us a
[57:55] life of prayer. Amen.
[57:58] Oh no. I I want to wait for the time
[57:59] when I can make a very long prayer. No,
[58:02] start with a small prayer. Just few
[58:04] words. Oh God, I thank you Lord. I thank
[58:06] you Lord. You wake up in the morning
[58:08] Lord I thank you Lord. The first the
[58:11] last thing to go before going to bed. Oh
[58:13] God thank you Lord. You must not be on
[58:16] the phone and checking. No no no no no.
[58:19] Amen. Amen. Amen. Just a small thing,
[58:22] God can go behind it. Amen. And give you
[58:26] more than what you can think. That's
[58:28] right. That's the principle of God.
[58:30] Otherwise, you rely on yourself. That's
[58:33] right. That's true.
[58:37] The hidden power in Shamgar killed 600
[58:40] Philistines with an ox goat. The hidden
[58:43] power in Daniel overcame the lions. The
[58:45] hidden power in the three Hebrews
[58:47] overcame the fire furnace. The hidden
[58:49] power in John the Baptist when they
[58:52] boiled him in oil he was still alive.
[58:55] What is that? The hidden power. Amen.
[58:57] The hidden power was behind the stone
[59:01] that David used. It was not that small
[59:04] stone that could kill that giant Golite.
[59:06] No, no, no, no. It was not the strength
[59:08] of David to kill that giant. No, no, no,
[59:10] no. It was God behind that stone that
[59:13] killed the giant. Amen. to prove that it
[59:16] was God killing the giant. The giant
[59:18] didn't didn't fall behind or backwards.
[59:21] He fall he fell forward to show that he
[59:25] had to worship God. Amen. He had to
[59:27] worship the God that was in David. Amen.
[59:30] The same God who was with David, the
[59:31] same God is with us this evening. Amen.
[59:34] for any giant that the enemy would try
[59:36] to throw before us to try to to to try
[59:40] to defy or to defy the the God the
[59:43] challenge to challenge our God. The same
[59:45] God is present this evening. Amen.
[59:48] That's right. Let's have faith in the in
[59:49] God's word.
[59:52] Praise God. Coming back to Samson, they
[59:54] could not understand how he could take
[59:56] the gate of gas and and its ports and
[59:58] carried them to the top of the gate of
[1:00:01] the city because he was a son of
[1:00:03] Abraham. And the city of Abraham shall
[1:00:06] possess every gate of the enemy.
[1:00:09] Every gate of the Once you possess the
[1:00:11] gate of the enemy, once you possess the
[1:00:14] gate of a city, you possess that city
[1:00:16] because you know the power of the city
[1:00:19] comes from that gate. So if God God has
[1:00:21] promised you and you and I, we shall
[1:00:23] possess the gates of the enemy.
[1:00:26] Amen. Whatever the enemy will put upon
[1:00:29] us, no weapon against you and I shall
[1:00:32] prosper. Amen. But we shall possess
[1:00:35] every gate of the enemy.
[1:00:38] Brother says,
[1:00:40] "And what does it take to make a
[1:00:42] Christian life? Not you, the Holy
[1:00:44] Spirit, but the Holy Spirit as you." You
[1:00:46] say, "I got the Holy Ghost." I don't
[1:00:48] think that should be say you must say
[1:00:50] the Holy Ghost got me. Then when the
[1:00:53] Holy Ghost gets you, the burdens, the
[1:00:56] yoke is easy. Then you pick up the big
[1:00:58] gates, the big gates of Gaza and pack
[1:01:01] them straight to Calvary.
[1:01:04] There on Mount Calvary, you lay them at
[1:01:07] the feet of Jesus and pray for your
[1:01:09] enemies, not with a grudge. Amen. So see
[1:01:12] when when you don't have you you you
[1:01:14] just have to carry every gate to the
[1:01:17] mountain and leave it at the gates at
[1:01:19] the feet of Jesus Christ. Leave it
[1:01:21] there. Don't carry it yourself. Leave
[1:01:23] you carry it and leave it to Jesus
[1:01:25] Christ. You have possessed Gaza. Amen.
[1:01:28] The spirit that was in the Philistines
[1:01:30] is the same spirit that is now today.
[1:01:32] Maybe I would say maybe in the actual
[1:01:33] world and not politic but that actual in
[1:01:36] amas and they just want to destroy. They
[1:01:38] just want to destroy. But let me tell
[1:01:40] you, Israel shall overame shall
[1:01:43] overcome. Amen.
[1:01:45] The prophet says, "When a man is in the
[1:01:48] line of duty for God, there is no gate.
[1:01:51] Nothing can stand in his way." The devil
[1:01:54] tried to fence God's man and people in
[1:01:56] one in one day with the Red Sea. But
[1:01:59] they went right on through just the
[1:02:01] same. When as long as a man is in the
[1:02:04] service of God, as long as the anointing
[1:02:06] and blessing is upon him, he should not
[1:02:08] fear nothing because his promise that he
[1:02:11] will be with you and nothing will bother
[1:02:13] us by no means. As long as you stay with
[1:02:17] the word of God, you will always be an
[1:02:19] overcomer. Always be an overcomer. Amen.
[1:02:23] So whenever we gather here, we can
[1:02:25] remove mountains, we can remove gates,
[1:02:27] we can ask God for deliverance. Amen.
[1:02:31] Samson being a type of of the church.
[1:02:40] Just want to get to that point. Maybe
[1:02:42] another point. So I want to change a
[1:02:43] little bit the corner here. But we saw
[1:02:45] Samson had a weakness. Maybe 10 10
[1:02:47] minutes here and I'll close. He loved he
[1:02:50] loved the woman and he finally he got
[1:02:53] into one woman called Delilah. Yes.
[1:02:56] Contrary to how Hollywood portrays that
[1:02:58] Delilah Delila loves her, loves him and
[1:03:02] he was trying to protect him. No,
[1:03:04] Delilah was she knew what was going on.
[1:03:08] She actually she actually betrayed him.
[1:03:10] Yeah. Judges 16:5 says, "The Lord of the
[1:03:13] Philistine came unto her and said unto
[1:03:15] her, entice him, and see wherein his
[1:03:17] strength lies, and by what means we may
[1:03:20] prevail against him that we may bind him
[1:03:23] to afflict him." So she knew from the
[1:03:26] very beginning what she was doing.
[1:03:27] That's what the enemy is doing to the
[1:03:29] church. That's what the enemy is doing
[1:03:30] to you and I. From the very beginning,
[1:03:32] the enemy want to destroy. He want to
[1:03:34] afflict. And he said, "We will give thee
[1:03:36] every one of us, 1100 pieces of silver."
[1:03:40] So because of popularity, because of
[1:03:42] money and I said you have to go and you
[1:03:44] have to def you have to to find where
[1:03:46] his strength is. Find for us where the
[1:03:49] strength is. And they came and she was
[1:03:51] you know the story she came and asked
[1:03:52] him what is your strength? Where is your
[1:03:54] strength lies? And Sam Samson being a
[1:03:56] little bit clever say you know just take
[1:03:58] seven green weaves and you know bind me
[1:04:00] and you see you see you see that I'll
[1:04:03] become weak like any other person. And
[1:04:04] then she did that and she put men around
[1:04:07] and the Philistine is around. said the
[1:04:08] Philistines upon thee and and and he
[1:04:11] woke up and he and he and and he removed
[1:04:13] all of those weeds and everything all
[1:04:15] the robes. The prophet says it was it
[1:04:17] was he was bound as a Catholic was
[1:04:19] bound. But Luther came Luther came and
[1:04:22] it was one deliverance once again. He
[1:04:24] came he overcome overcame. Amen. Praise
[1:04:26] be to God. He overcame and then she came
[1:04:28] again asked him what is your secret? You
[1:04:30] see what you lie to me. What is your
[1:04:31] secret? Then he goes there and says,
[1:04:33] "You know what? You take new robes and
[1:04:35] you bind me and you I will become like
[1:04:37] the other one." And she bind him and she
[1:04:39] and she put again man around and come
[1:04:41] and attack him. And then the Philistines
[1:04:44] upon him and he rose and said and he
[1:04:46] rose and and he chased them everything.
[1:04:48] Amen. Amen. Prophet says, "Yeah, that
[1:04:51] was the lutter. They was bound. Now
[1:04:53] Wesley came up and then the third time
[1:04:56] then they came and what can I do? What
[1:04:57] can I?" So you take you weaved me with
[1:04:59] the seven locks. But you remember every
[1:05:01] secret that he was telling, he was
[1:05:03] getting closer to to the real secret,
[1:05:06] the seven locks, the word of God, what
[1:05:09] God has given him as a promise. That the
[1:05:11] place where it was. And every time he
[1:05:14] was revealing, he was getting closer and
[1:05:16] closer to a place where he was. Amen.
[1:05:20] And then she bound him. And she bound
[1:05:22] him upon a web. As I look in the word, I
[1:05:24] say if that we the seven logs of my head
[1:05:27] with the web, oh maybe that the web that
[1:05:30] is how is making the church become so
[1:05:33] lukewarm sometimes and then like that.
[1:05:35] Oh God, deliver us from the web spirit.
[1:05:39] Web spirit is is worse than television
[1:05:41] spirit because it can bind. It's
[1:05:44] actually the same spirit. Maybe the same
[1:05:46] spirit seven times worse because it it
[1:05:49] can distract you. It can just kill your
[1:05:51] time and all the different things you
[1:05:53] you you become bound to it. Even
[1:05:56] scientists themselves they say you
[1:05:58] become addicted to it. Addicted to it.
[1:06:01] Television sometimes you you just look
[1:06:03] at it but when you become
[1:06:06] activated you think that you are doing
[1:06:07] any action but actually you are being
[1:06:09] addicted to it. Amen. Says when you bind
[1:06:13] him like that then the prophet says he
[1:06:17] was delivered again. Pentecostal came
[1:06:19] out. Oh, thank God for the Pentecostals.
[1:06:22] But now she came back to him again and
[1:06:24] says, "You tell me, tell me the real
[1:06:26] secret. Tell me your real secret." Let's
[1:06:28] read in the Bible. Tell me your real
[1:06:30] secret.
[1:06:33] She says, and she said unto him, "How
[1:06:35] can thou say I love thee when thy heart
[1:06:38] is not with me?" Now she's getting
[1:06:41] deeper in the heart. Where is your
[1:06:44] heart, Samson? Where is your heart?
[1:06:47] says, "Where is your heart? Your heart
[1:06:49] is not with me." Of course, your heart
[1:06:51] must not be with you. My heart must be
[1:06:54] with God. Why you want to change my
[1:06:56] heart to be in you? And Samson didn't
[1:06:59] understand that. And he let that heart
[1:07:01] go to Delilah. Remember, I should say
[1:07:04] that has mocked me these three times,
[1:07:06] has not told me wherein that great
[1:07:08] strength lies. And came to pass when she
[1:07:11] pressed him daily with her words, and
[1:07:13] hedged him so that his soul was vexed
[1:07:15] unto death. Then he told her all his
[1:07:18] heart. Now he gave all his heart to her.
[1:07:22] Oh Samson, don't do that. Don't give
[1:07:25] your heart to Delila. Give your strength
[1:07:28] and your heart to God. That's sometimes
[1:07:31] the problem with the church. We give our
[1:07:33] strength only to the church, but our
[1:07:35] heart is somewhere else. What is the
[1:07:38] time? What time is it? Let me go. My
[1:07:40] heart is somewhere else. Oh God, help my
[1:07:43] heart to be in you, Lord.
[1:07:46] Then he said unto her, "There has no
[1:07:48] come a razor upon my head, and I've been
[1:07:51] a Nazarite unto God from my mother's
[1:07:53] womb. And if I be shaven, then my
[1:07:56] strength will go from me. I shall become
[1:07:58] weak and be like any other man." And
[1:08:00] when Dela saw that he had told her all
[1:08:03] his heart, then she sent and called for
[1:08:06] the lord of the Philistines says, "Come
[1:08:07] up this month, for he has showed me all
[1:08:11] his heart." So the point he put all his
[1:08:14] heart on Dala. Then the lord of the
[1:08:16] Philistine came up unto her and brought
[1:08:18] money into hand and she made him sleep
[1:08:20] upon her knees and she called for a man.
[1:08:22] He caused him to shave off the seven
[1:08:24] locks of his head and she began to
[1:08:27] afflict him and his strength went from
[1:08:28] him. Let me say the main problem was
[1:08:33] definitely identified as the problem of
[1:08:36] the heart. He had been a Nazerite only
[1:08:39] by name. Samson has been a Nazerite only
[1:08:42] by name. I've been a Nazerite but
[1:08:44] actually you had he was not a Nazerite
[1:08:46] anymore. He has been drinking.
[1:08:49] He has been going with woman. He has
[1:08:51] been with dead people people. So he was
[1:08:54] not a Nazerite anymore. But it was just
[1:08:56] by name to be a Nazerite. But but but
[1:08:59] God was still checking where his heart
[1:09:01] is going to be. When his heart was
[1:09:03] really went away then he lost
[1:09:05] everything. Amen. Maybe Samson could
[1:09:08] think, you know, if I could get away, I
[1:09:10] think the main problem could be if I can
[1:09:12] get away with this, if I can get away
[1:09:14] with this, you can get get away with,
[1:09:16] God is still with me. That was our
[1:09:18] opening scripture. Oh, even the other
[1:09:20] times has delivered me, he can deliver
[1:09:22] me now as well. But Samson, your heart
[1:09:26] is not there anymore. Church of God. Oh,
[1:09:29] where is your heart? Where is your God?
[1:09:32] Renew our love for you. Our first love,
[1:09:36] Lord. Our first love for you. Our first
[1:09:38] love for the word of God. Our first love
[1:09:40] for the church. Our first love to be on
[1:09:43] fire for you, Lord. Renew our heart to
[1:09:46] you, Lord. We can be prospering. We can
[1:09:49] be like Samson and be, oh Lord. Maybe
[1:09:51] you are still with me. You are still
[1:09:52] with me. I still But God, oh Lord, stay
[1:09:54] with us.
[1:09:57] Amen. I don't want to be negative, but
[1:09:59] let me cry in our heart. Lord, I want my
[1:10:02] heart to be completely to you. I want my
[1:10:05] heart to be completely to you. I don't
[1:10:08] want even do to serve you just by by
[1:10:11] pushing or by pressure. No. Samson was
[1:10:15] maybe serving God just by pressure.
[1:10:17] Under pressure, he has to defend God.
[1:10:19] When he's being attacked, he has to
[1:10:20] defend God. But you have been born with
[1:10:23] a commission to serve God with all your
[1:10:26] heart, Samson. We will hold your heart
[1:10:29] without constraint. We will from your
[1:10:30] holy heart. Lord, make me a Christian
[1:10:33] from my heart. We thank God for Malachi
[1:10:36] for who came to change our heart to
[1:10:38] restore our heart. Amen.
[1:10:44] John 16:20 says, "And he said the
[1:10:46] Philistine be upon his son. He awoke
[1:10:48] asleep and said, I will go out as the
[1:10:50] other times before and shake myself and
[1:10:53] we know that the Lord was departed from
[1:10:55] him." He thought that maybe he thought
[1:10:58] that all the things he have been doing
[1:11:00] it was by his own strength because I
[1:11:02] will shake myself. I will do it again.
[1:11:05] No, you were not doing it by yourself.
[1:11:07] It was the Holy Spirit upon you. Samson,
[1:11:10] the church can never prevail by itself.
[1:11:12] It has to be the power of the Holy
[1:11:14] Ghost. Oh Lord, send your power in our
[1:11:17] heart. Is that a desire in your heart
[1:11:19] this evening as we look into this type
[1:11:21] of the scripture? Lord, give me your
[1:11:23] power. Lord give me your strength. Give
[1:11:27] me the real strength is through your
[1:11:29] power. Lord give me the real strength is
[1:11:31] through the sincerity. Give me your real
[1:11:33] strength is through prayer. In other
[1:11:35] message the prophet says yeah they
[1:11:37] shaved him. They removed his power. What
[1:11:39] was his power? It was the power of
[1:11:40] prayer. If you don't have the power of
[1:11:43] prayer, you you you might be deceived.
[1:11:45] You might be enticed. You might be
[1:11:47] defeated. But let me tell you, you have
[1:11:49] been ordained to defeat the enemy. Amen.
[1:11:53] You have been ordained to bind the
[1:11:55] mamba. Amen. The church has been
[1:11:58] ordained to bind the mamba. But what
[1:12:00] does it take to bind the mamba? It takes
[1:12:02] the sincerity. It takes the heart to be
[1:12:05] turned completely to God.
[1:12:09] Amen.
[1:12:11] The prophetic code says when God calls a
[1:12:14] man to do something, he just as well
[1:12:16] come to it or he'll be miserable the
[1:12:19] rest of his days. Amen. But let me
[1:12:22] finish with this. John 16:22. How be it
[1:12:25] the hair of his head began to grow again
[1:12:29] after he was shaven. Praise be to God
[1:12:32] that there is still hope. Amen. Praise
[1:12:34] be to God that we have been called to
[1:12:38] defeat the enemy. The prophet says in
[1:12:40] this church by the word says here is the
[1:12:43] only hope that have this morning is to w
[1:12:46] to wind up my message is this. While
[1:12:48] Samson was bound, a new shock of hair
[1:12:50] growled out. God sent out another church
[1:12:54] just before the end time that the power
[1:12:57] of the Holy Ghost can come unto her in
[1:12:59] the demonstration of the spirit. Mark 16
[1:13:02] can follow the church. Acts 2:4, Acts
[1:13:05] 238, all of it will be following right
[1:13:08] along with the church. Signs and wonders
[1:13:12] accompany the apostles. Great signs of
[1:13:14] his res resurrection accompany them.
[1:13:17] While we are in prison, surely God is
[1:13:20] growing a crop somewhere. That's why I
[1:13:23] took my title. God is growing a crop
[1:13:26] somewhere for the last great kill.
[1:13:30] We are here for the last great kill.
[1:13:34] Maybe you, my Christian friend, here
[1:13:36] this morning, may it be your strength
[1:13:38] has begun to grow. I pray that this
[1:13:40] message this morning, preach this
[1:13:42] morning and out of this land you to
[1:13:44] where this will go. I tr that this
[1:13:46] message will bring the vitamins to your
[1:13:49] system that will grow a spiritual power
[1:13:51] back into your life again. Samson now
[1:13:54] his hair grew. Amen. As he was in
[1:13:57] prison, his hair grew.
[1:14:01] But do you notice that even though his
[1:14:03] hair grew, the strength was not there?
[1:14:10] It's quite amazing. Verse 28, 16 verse
[1:14:14] 28 says, "And Samson called unto the
[1:14:16] Lord when you know when they put him in
[1:14:18] front of all the lords of the
[1:14:19] Philistines, Samson called unto the Lord
[1:14:21] and said, Oh Lord God, remember me, I
[1:14:24] pray thee." And strengthen me, I pray
[1:14:27] thee only this once, oh God. So he had
[1:14:31] his God had to fulfill his word. God had
[1:14:34] to fulfill his word because the covenant
[1:14:36] was with the seven locks. if as long as
[1:14:38] you stay Nazarite, as long as you clean,
[1:14:40] as as long as as long you come back to
[1:14:42] me. But now, even though his hair grew,
[1:14:46] now God is waiting for him to change his
[1:14:48] attitude. Now realize, Lord, it's not my
[1:14:52] strength. It's not by myself.
[1:14:55] Now, Lord, I need you. I need you. Come
[1:14:59] and remember me. Amen. That's the
[1:15:01] church. You know, the bride is the is
[1:15:04] Samson being restored. Amen. The Samson
[1:15:07] had have the eyes that have been
[1:15:09] restored. When they killed him, when
[1:15:11] they took him and bound him, they remove
[1:15:13] his eyes. But thank God for the prophet
[1:15:16] who represent the eyes. So the bride is
[1:15:19] the he is is Samson being restored. Is
[1:15:23] Samson having the new locks. Amen. The
[1:15:26] new lock that comes out. But those new
[1:15:28] locks need to have a different attitude.
[1:15:30] Now it's God remember me. Amen. Give me
[1:15:33] more of your love, Lord. Give me, let my
[1:15:36] heart be turned to you completely. Lord,
[1:15:39] change me. Give me more sincerity. Make
[1:15:41] me more sincere. In order to bind this
[1:15:44] mamba, I need to be more sincere, Lord.
[1:15:46] That's the desire of your heart this
[1:15:48] evening. That's certainly the desire of
[1:15:50] my heart. Lord, make me more sincere as
[1:15:53] you have been restoring us to you. Amen.
[1:15:58] Amen. Do you love the Lord? Just give a
[1:16:00] little bit of time. Let's pray together
[1:16:02] as the musicians can come just prepare
[1:16:05] our heart for
[1:16:09] I thought I'll be small short but still
[1:16:12] I passed my time but it's okay I will
[1:16:15] get there one time.
[1:16:17] Amen. My heart used to get shorter and
[1:16:20] shorter but um I I was carried away.
[1:16:25] Forgive me for that.
[1:16:27] Amen. Lord send your power just now as
[1:16:31] prepare our heart.

[1:17:49] Lord, send the power just now.
[1:17:53] Oh Lord, send the power just now. Oh
[1:17:59] Lord, send the power just now and
[1:18:03] baptize everyone. Verse three.
[1:18:08] In old time power was given
[1:18:13] to our fathers who were true.
[1:18:18] This is promise to be
[1:18:23] and we only have it to amen. Oh
[1:18:30] Lord send the power just now.
[1:18:34] Oh Lord, send the power just now.
[1:18:39] Oh Lord, send the power just now and

[1:20:14] sunshine or shadows.
[1:20:20] He
[1:20:22] careth for you.
[1:20:30] We have heard as the music is playing
[1:20:32] softly. We
[1:20:34] message was maybe too long but just
[1:20:37] think of the the some point that God has
[1:20:40] emphasized this evening. He called you
[1:20:43] for a purpose.
[1:20:45] He called you to serve him. Serve him
[1:20:48] with all your heart. Called you to be an
[1:20:52] overcomer. And he ordained you to be an
[1:20:54] overcomer. We will be overcomers.
[1:20:57] But we desire Lord that our heart be
[1:20:59] completely tuned to him. Lord, fill our
[1:21:02] heart with more of your love. Love for
[1:21:05] you to love you, to love your word, to
[1:21:08] love my brother, to love my sister.
[1:21:11] Lord, help me to be more sincere. Help
[1:21:13] me, Lord. Even when I'm praying for the
[1:21:16] different needs that have been
[1:21:17] mentioned, help me to be more sincere.
[1:21:20] Father, for Father David, for brother
[1:21:22] Luke, we pray, Father, Lord, for brother
[1:21:25] Dan. We pray for Sister Mida. Pray,
[1:21:28] Father, for the upcoming services or for
[1:21:32] all those needs that you might have in
[1:21:33] your heart. Lord, make me more sincere.
[1:21:37] Help me, Lord, to be in the channel
[1:21:38] where you can use me for your glory, for
[1:21:41] your purpose, Father.
[1:21:43] Amen. As the music's playing, let us
[1:21:46] pray each and every one.

[1:33:42] Amen. So just uh God is faithful and he
[1:33:47] has ordained us to be overcomers.
[1:33:49] No matter what the enemy will put in
[1:33:51] front of us, if we are sincere, if we
[1:33:54] are humble and claiming God's promises,
[1:33:58] we will kill more. Amen. When we are
[1:34:01] able, we are we are willing to die to
[1:34:03] our own pride like Samson came to that
[1:34:06] level. Lord, I'm willing to die to my
[1:34:09] own pride. He killed more than when he
[1:34:12] wanted to keep his own life, his own
[1:34:14] ego. That's where we want to be. God, I
[1:34:16] just want to be more like you and be
[1:34:18] humble and die to myself. Amen. All is
