[8:08] ask for you just to come. And I know
[8:10] you're already here,
[8:13] but Lord Jesus, still we our physical
[8:16] eyes can't see you, but Lord Jesus, our
[8:19] hearts sees you.
[8:21] We know that you're here because we feel
[8:23] you in our hearts. And tonight I pray uh
[8:26] that you would bless us, bless our
[8:28] brother as he leads us in song. May the
[8:30] Holy Spirit just guide us and lead us
[8:33] Lord throughout the whole service. And
[8:35] Lord Jesus, bless our brother Moses.
[8:38] We've been so enjoying the word of God,
[8:40] Lord God, as we have started with faith
[8:44] and then virtue and knowledge.
[8:47] Lord God, and we're so grateful.
[8:50] Help us to make sure that we nourish on
[8:53] this precious word of God. Heat the word
[8:56] of God so that we become into your
[8:58] image. We thank you, Lord. Even Lord, we
[9:01] pray for the services upcoming
[9:04] with brother Prasan. Lord, I pray that
[9:06] uh you would just my God, may you just
[9:10] open the windows of heaven
[9:12] and may you just be able to speak
[9:15] through him what we have need of in our
[9:17] families.
[9:19] Oh, we're some of us are older, Lord. We
[9:21] think we already know it all, but Lord,
[9:24] we're going to be hearing your word,
[9:26] Lord. We're so thankful for that, Lord.
[9:30] Blessed be thy name. Bless us tonight.
[9:33] We ask it all in Jesus name. the
[9:35] different ones that are at home. Maybe
[9:38] bless them and help them. Oh God, we
[9:40] need one another.
[9:43] &gt;&gt; Put it on our hearts, Lord, that we are
[9:46] a flock of sheep that need one another.
[9:49] Protect one another. We have to keep
[9:51] company with one another, Lord Jesus.
[9:54] It's so important in this day that we're
[9:56] living in. Make it more real to us, Lord
[9:59] Jesus, that it's not just coming for
[10:01] just a preacher, Lord. that we're not
[10:03] coming here for any man, for any man. It
[10:06] doesn't matter who he's his name is.
[10:08] We're coming to see you, Lord, to meet
[10:10] with you and to feel your presence. So I
[10:13] pray, oh God, put it in our hearts,
[10:16] Lord. I believe that's the that's the
[10:18] thing that is in the bride. We want to
[10:20] hear the voice of our bridegroom. And so
[10:22] we invite your Holy Spirit to move upon
[10:25] us. Speak to us, Lord, supernaturally
[10:29] as we've been listening to the message,
[10:31] Lord Jesus. The important part, the
[10:33] supernatural power of the word. It's not
[10:37] just the natural presentation of a word,
[10:40] but it's the supernatural Holy Spirit
[10:43] that changes our life, changes our
[10:46] attitudes, changes everything about us.
[10:49] So I pray that your blessing would rest
[10:51] upon this service tonight and may we
[10:54] reach out Lord and glorify your name.
[10:57] Thank you Lord for being our savior, our
[10:59] healer, our wonderful heavenly
[11:01] bridegroom and we want to all say we
[11:03] love you. Can we all say together Lord I
[11:06] love you Jesus Jesus.
[11:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Praise his wonderful
[11:10] name. Amen.
[11:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:12] &gt;&gt; God bless you brother.

[22:53] uh we just pass our condolences to you.
[22:56] May God bless you richly. That's good to
[22:58] see you here and pray that God will

[23:03] comfort around you through these
[23:06] difficult times. And he's is the real
[23:08] comforter. Amen.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[23:13] go to the word of God and Colossians um
[23:19] chapter one.
[23:22] Colossians chapter
[23:25] first chapter
[23:33] after Philippians
[23:35] as don't forget the special meetings
[23:39] that starting on Saturday evening at
[23:42] 5:30. I had few announcement I forgot
[23:45] what to say and um so it start at 5:30.
[23:51] Um usually when I put the time I put it
[23:54] as a the quiet time but we have sent
[23:58] those
[23:59] those um some of invite to other people.
[24:03] Usually other churches when they put the
[24:05] time it start at the singing time. Um so
[24:09] there is a bit confusion there. We
[24:11] probably see some people arriving 30
[24:13] minutes before that time.
[24:15] I'm thinking we take this time as a as a
[24:20] as a song time. Would it be okay if we
[24:23] take it as a song time except the Sunday
[24:26] one? I think they will understand that.
[24:28] But um for the for the Saturday and
[24:33] Sunday we put it as a song time. Um
[24:38] if if there is a we can continue
[24:41] communication through the WhatsApp group
[24:43] or something. I thought I was thinking
[24:44] to think about it and put it as a song
[24:47] time as we can start at a time. So be 30
[24:49] minutes a bit earlier than in the
[24:51] evening but on Sunday we keep the same
[24:54] time.
[24:56] I'm sorry for that. Um but I'm thinking
[25:00] the service start when we have a quiet
[25:01] time that how I like it so that people
[25:05] come and respect that quiet time and
[25:07] sometimes struggle many things but when
[25:10] we prepare our hearts and then we
[25:13] usually get blessed more. Amen.
[25:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:18] uh collisions
[25:21] 1
[25:23] 9 20
[25:28] 9- 20 so I'll I will read some and then
[25:31] I'll let you go I'll let you sit down
[25:33] not goats
[25:36] chapter 1 verse 9
[25:40] for this cause we also since the day we
[25:43] heard it do not cease to pray for you
[25:46] and what is to prayer about and to
[25:49] desire that you might be filled with the
[25:52] knowledge of his will in all wisdom and
[25:55] spiritual understanding.
[25:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:57] &gt;&gt; That's what the desire of the prophet
[25:59] Paul and I believe the same desire that
[26:02] we have the knowledge of God's will in
[26:05] all wisdom and spiritual understanding.
[26:08] And what else? that we might walk worthy
[26:10] of the Lord unto all pleasing, being
[26:14] fruitful in every good work and
[26:17] increasing in the knowledge of God.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; You can have a seat. Amen. God bless his
[26:23] word.
[26:31] As I looked at this um the knowledge or
[26:33] I just continue a little bit on as on
[26:36] Sunday on the knowledge the third the
[26:38] third attribute of the statue of the
[26:40] perfect man look at it you can see that
[26:44] it's just many angles we can never
[26:46] finish it um but um just put the surface
[26:51] of it and then so that we might move on
[26:54] thought that maybe I'll just touch it
[26:55] again before the main services and break
[26:58] it so I just want to touch leave it
[27:01] again this evening before we go into
[27:03] prayer. So for 20 30 minutes just uh
[27:06] give a little bit of exhortation about
[27:08] it. So go u uh Paul's prayer was that we
[27:12] might walk worthy of of the Lord unto
[27:14] all pleasing being fruitful in every
[27:17] good work and increasing in the
[27:20] knowledge of God. So increasing the
[27:22] knowledge of God is a desire. It has to
[27:24] be a desire. It has to be something that
[27:27] all of us desire to have because it's
[27:30] not a one-time thing. It's something
[27:32] that is progressive. As you grow, as you
[27:35] grow, we should grow in knowledge of God
[27:37] more and more so that you can be
[27:39] pleasing in everything and have be
[27:41] willing pleasing to do every good work.
[27:44] If you don't know, usually you don't do
[27:47] things because you don't know. Many
[27:49] people don't do they are good people and
[27:51] everything. They don't do things that we
[27:53] do because they don't know. They don't
[27:55] know better. They don't know anything.
[27:57] And and and sometimes when you tell him,
[28:00] "Oh, I did not know." Amen. But but it's
[28:03] I think God's grace. I think God's grace
[28:06] when you know what you have to do.
[28:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you know what to do, when you
[28:10] know the will of God, it's God's grace.
[28:12] So we should be the more thankful or the
[28:15] more and more thankful because we know
[28:17] what we know. Amen. The one that's been
[28:20] I given more, it will be asked more
[28:22] because they know better. Amen. The
[28:24] other ones don't know better and they do
[28:26] according to their own conscience. But
[28:28] thank God to the to the bride of Jesus
[28:30] Christ in this last age, God has made it
[28:33] that she has to know everything that he
[28:36] needs to know in order to go in the
[28:37] rapture. God has opened the word of God
[28:39] so that she knows and she's aware of it.
[28:42] Amen. God has to make it a revelation.
[28:44] God has make it life. But thank God that
[28:47] we already know. Amen. And that
[28:49] knowledge need to continue to increase
[28:51] and to become more and more real. And
[28:53] then the Bible continues, "Strengthen
[28:55] with Almighty according to his glorious
[28:57] power unto all patience and
[29:00] longsuffering with joyfulness, giving
[29:03] thanks unto the Father, which has made
[29:05] us meet to be partakers of the
[29:08] inheritance of the saints in light, who
[29:11] had delivered us from the power of
[29:13] darkness and translated us into the
[29:15] kingdom of his dear son." Is God who
[29:19] delivered us from the power of darkness.
[29:21] It's God who has translated us into the
[29:24] kingdom of his dear son. Amen.
[29:26] &gt;&gt; It's not by our own power but by God's
[29:28] grace that we have what we are. Amen.
[29:31] And the Bible says in whom we have
[29:33] redemption through his blood even the
[29:35] forgiveness of sins because he is the
[29:39] image of the invisible God, the
[29:41] firstborn of every creature. Amen. Is
[29:43] the Lord Jesus Christ. For by him were
[29:46] all things created, that are in heaven
[29:48] and that are in the earth, visible and
[29:51] invisible, whether they be thrones or
[29:54] dominions or principalities and powers.
[29:57] All things were created by him and for
[29:59] him.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; Glory to his name.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; He's the one who deserve to be
[30:03] glorified. He's the one who deserve to
[30:05] be praised.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; As your brother was singing, he's worthy
[30:08] of everything. He's worthy of everything
[30:10] Lord because he's the alpha and the
[30:12] omega. says before all things and by him
[30:16] all things consist. He is the head of
[30:18] the body, the c the church who is the
[30:21] beginning, the firstborn from the dead,
[30:24] that in all things he might have the
[30:26] preeminence. For it pleased the father
[30:28] that in him should all fullness dwell.
[30:31] Amen.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; In Christ Jesus in in the Lord Jesus
[30:34] Christ in him was all the fullness of
[30:37] the deity of God. Amen. Even his even
[30:42] his flesh was a spoken word. Amen.
[30:44] Brother Banam's flesh was not a spoken
[30:46] word. But but the Lord Jesus Christ, his
[30:49] flesh was a spoken word.
[30:51] &gt;&gt; And in him dwell all the fullness of
[30:54] God.
[30:55] &gt;&gt; And having made peace through the blood
[30:57] of his cross by him to reconcile all
[31:00] things unto himself, by him I say,
[31:03] whether there be things on earth or
[31:05] things in heaven. Praise be to his name.
[31:10] Glory in his name. I will take this um
[31:13] second scripture where I will take my
[31:15] title.
[31:17] Daniel 11:32
[31:19] says, "In such as do wickedly against
[31:21] the covenant shall he corrupt,
[31:25] and such as do wickedly against the
[31:27] covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries.
[31:32] But the people that do know their God
[31:35] shall be strong and do exploit.
[31:39] I'll give it a title. Those who know
[31:41] their God. The people who know their God
[31:44] shall be strong and do exploit.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; It's a promise of God. The prophet when
[31:49] he to touches the scripture says it's
[31:52] not something that might be. It's
[31:54] something that is a a certainty. The
[31:57] people who do know their God, they shall
[31:59] be strong and they shall do exploit.
[32:02] They shall do great things. People who
[32:04] know their God, they shall do great
[32:06] things. I was just checking out what is
[32:08] I looking for the word that exploit.
[32:10] Yeah, what is exploit according to the
[32:12] Bible? What is it mean? Actually, so I
[32:14] looked at it and then this is what the
[32:16] internet gave me that says actually do
[32:18] exploit comes from two Hebrew words say
[32:22] they shall do. So the the word exploit
[32:26] is added by the translators by clarity
[32:28] of English.
[32:30] So in actually the word that was
[32:32] expressed in in Hebrews it say they
[32:35] shall do or act or make and perform. So
[32:38] there's no specific word for exploit but
[32:40] even when you are doing something the
[32:43] action that you are doing it has to be
[32:45] an exploit it has to be something great
[32:47] that you are doing. So when he says
[32:49] those who know their God shall be strong
[32:52] and they shall do something. They shall
[32:54] do something they do think something
[32:56] that they have to do has to be
[32:58] marvelous. That Hebrew phrase in in
[33:00] Hebrews implies taking actions. It means
[33:04] doing mighty deeds. Doing mighty deeds.
[33:07] It means acting with boldness and
[33:09] purpose. It's rising to the occasion in
[33:13] face of evil. I kind of like that
[33:15] because
[33:17] only the bride will come to the point
[33:19] where she can face the the evil of this
[33:22] age.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; Only the bride can know what to do in
[33:25] this time because
[34:00] Wonderful.
[34:02] I'm back. Thank you very much, brother.
[34:08] Acting with boldness and purpose, rising
[34:10] to the occasion in face of evil. So,
[34:13] because only the bride can come to the
[34:15] level where she knows what to do and can
[34:17] stand against the evil of the age that
[34:20] we are living in. The bride will stand
[34:22] for what she knows to be the truth.
[34:24] Amen. The bride will not bind to the
[34:26] pressure of laudicia. The bride will not
[34:29] succumb to the pressure of laudicia. But
[34:32] the bride she will do the mighty deeds
[34:34] by staying faithful to the word of God.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; Because she knows her God. Amen. She
[34:39] knows who he is. She knows what he says
[34:41] according to the word of God. And she's
[34:43] going to obey God's word. Amen. The
[34:46] prophet will say, "But those who know
[34:48] that God shall do exploit and the power
[34:50] of the resurrected Jesus Christ lives in
[34:53] the man." That's right. He's not dead.
[34:56] He's risen. Christ is not dead. He's
[34:58] risen. I will be with you even in you.
[35:01] And the things that I do shall you do
[35:03] also. Amen. Because how can she do those
[35:06] things? Because God is in her. Because
[35:09] the spirit of God is inside of her and
[35:12] she's bound to do the great things.
[35:14] Amen. Who are those people? Who are
[35:16] those people who will know their God?
[35:18] That the people that the people who know
[35:21] their God are the ones the one to whom
[35:23] the word of God will be open to. Amen.
[35:26] In Daniel 12:4 in continuation the
[35:29] prophet you look in the court of the
[35:31] prophet usually relate the Daniel 11
[35:34] that we have read to Daniel 12. The
[35:36] people are connected is the same people
[35:39] the people who know their God. Amen. Are
[35:41] you with me this evening? Amen.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; Daniel 12 says, "At that time shall
[35:46] Michael stand up, the great prince that
[35:48] stand up for the children of thy people,
[35:50] and there shall be a time of there shall
[35:52] be and there shall be a time of
[35:54] trouble." I believe we are living in a
[35:57] time of trouble.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; We are living in a time where people are
[36:00] becoming nervous and insanity and people
[36:03] don't know who they are. They don't know
[36:04] their identity. Those are kind of
[36:07] trouble where we don't know the truth.
[36:09] You don't know what is right is right.
[36:10] You don't know what is wrong is wrong.
[36:12] People we call right wrong and wrong
[36:15] right. Time of confusion, time of
[36:18] trouble. Said there shall be a time of
[36:20] trouble such as never was since there
[36:23] was a nation even to that same time. And
[36:25] at that time thy people shall be
[36:27] delivered. Everyone that shall be found
[36:30] written in the book. Amen. I believe the
[36:33] bride is the part. He's talking about
[36:34] the bride there. the part of the related
[36:37] to the bride there because they will be
[36:39] find in the book and they will be
[36:40] delivered. As we come in prayer today,
[36:43] we have to have that certainty that God
[36:46] said if we know him, we are going to do
[36:48] exploit through God.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Through his spirit, we can do
[36:52] great exploit
[36:54] &gt;&gt; and many of them shall sleep in the
[36:55] dust. Everyone that shall be found
[36:57] written in the book, and many of them
[37:00] shall that sleep in the dust shall uh or
[37:02] many of them that sleep in the dust of
[37:04] the earth shall awake. Some to
[37:06] everlasting life, and some to shame, and
[37:09] everlasting contempt, and they that be
[37:12] wise shall shine as the brightness of
[37:14] the firmament, and they that turn many
[37:17] to righteousness as the stars forever
[37:20] and ever. By thou, oh Daniel, shut up
[37:24] the words and seal the book, even to the
[37:26] time of the end. Many shall run to and
[37:29] fro and knowledge shall be increased.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; Sha shut up the words and seal the book
[37:37] even to the time of the end. To the time
[37:40] when we are living in the time of the
[37:41] end. Daniel had a commandment that he
[37:45] has to shut up the words. He know he
[37:48] heard some of the words. He will himself
[37:50] declare, "I don't understand everything
[37:52] that I heard in in in in Daniel 12. I
[37:55] didn't understand everything that I
[37:57] heard, but I told me to shut to shut up
[38:00] the words and to seal the book until the
[38:02] time of the end." But many shall run to
[38:05] and fro and knowledge shall be
[38:06] increased. But in this time, there is a
[38:09] purpose. There is a promise to the
[38:10] there's a pro promise to some people to
[38:13] those who will know their God, they
[38:15] shall do great exploit. The prophet says
[38:18] we are living in a time of scientific
[38:20] research.
[38:22] Says knowledge shall increase in the
[38:24] last days and we see the hour we are
[38:26] living. Notice the condition of the
[38:28] world and the conditions of science. It
[38:31] says the increase in scientific
[38:33] research. One time my grandfather went
[38:35] to see my grandmother in an oxcart. Now
[38:38] it's a jet plane even in orbit in the
[38:41] air and out of space. He says who said
[38:44] this? He says then prophet code says
[38:45] Daniel 12:4 said knowledge shall
[38:47] increase in the last days. We see the
[38:50] Yahweh we are we are living.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; So not knowledge has increased and we
[38:54] see technology has increased. Knowledge
[38:56] has increased in all the aspects you
[38:59] know the things now you know incredible
[39:02] things and medical science and all
[39:04] different things as we heard on Sunday
[39:06] but that's the knowledge of the world.
[39:08] The knowledge of the world has
[39:09] increased. But remember as the knowledge
[39:12] is of the world is increasing on on the
[39:15] worldly things that not where we put our
[39:18] trust. That's not where we put our
[39:19] confidence. But the natural sometime is
[39:22] a type of the spiritual. Amen. In the
[39:25] spiritual realm also God is unveiling
[39:27] great mysteries. Amen. We see in the
[39:29] world they talk about artificial
[39:31] intelligence. Oh that thing is a kind of
[39:34] a monster, right? Because it can do
[39:36] almost everything. And and the more
[39:38] they're training it and I I work a
[39:40] little bit work and my work there to
[39:42] train it and to see how it can just
[39:43] learn. And the more you teach it, the
[39:45] more it learns and the more it learns,
[39:47] the more information it has, the more it
[39:49] can give you the closest answer to the
[39:52] information that you give him. So it's
[39:54] just something and it gives such speed.
[39:57] They call it a super super brain. It's a
[39:59] super brain. The more you train, it
[40:01] become just so powerful and it can do
[40:04] almost anything. Anything that that that
[40:06] requires a memory. Oh that you I mean
[40:09] people have to change job. Everything
[40:11] that require memory they have to change
[40:13] job. Amen. Everything that is repetitive
[40:15] you have to change. You have to think
[40:16] how to to move to another place because
[40:18] it will take over. Amen.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; But as that inter art artificial
[40:23] intelligence is there I believe God is
[40:25] not relying on artificial intelligence.
[40:28] God has come as the headstone to give us
[40:31] the real intelligence. God has come with
[40:34] the will of God to give us the mind of
[40:36] Christ. That's why it is our desire.
[40:38] God, give me the mind of Christ to think
[40:41] like you, to see like you, to have the
[40:43] wisdom like you, to have the
[40:45] understanding like you, to have the
[40:47] discernment like you.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; Prophet says the Bible say they will run
[40:53] to and fro in these last days. Knowledge
[40:55] shall increase. It's a sign of the end
[40:58] time. Super. Everything must be super.
[41:01] It won't work. And and even they want
[41:04] super people. So they they got a
[41:06] television cast they call Superman.
[41:09] Always something super super super two
[41:12] or three of them has committed. You talk
[41:14] about people playing Superman. Then some
[41:16] of them committed suicide. So everything
[41:18] is about super super races super things
[41:21] super brain super people. But thank God
[41:24] there is also a super race. Amen.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; There's a God super race. It's those who
[41:29] are filled with the Holy Ghost. The
[41:31] proverb say if you have the Holy Ghost
[41:33] those who are in Africa, those who are
[41:35] in India, those who are in Europe, those
[41:37] who are in Canada, those who are in
[41:39] United States, all will behave the same
[41:41] way. Why? Because they have the Holy
[41:44] Ghost that will make them identical.
[41:46] Amen.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; It the robe is not different from the
[41:49] people to behave differently in Africa
[41:51] and to behave here. The Holy Ghost is
[41:53] the robe that that should be the same
[41:56] for everybody. Amen. Don't say this is
[41:58] the gospel only for African people. It
[42:00] is the gospel only for white people. No,
[42:03] it's the gospel for every nation.
[42:05] Because once we have the Holy Ghost, you
[42:08] become part of that super race of God.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; Super people. Amen. Those who know their
[42:13] God. Amen. It's not the knowledge only.
[42:15] The knowledge is the mind. But to know
[42:18] him as a person, to know him having a
[42:20] relationship with me as I mentioned a
[42:22] little bit on Sunday is not only to know
[42:24] about him, but is to know the person of
[42:27] Christ,
[42:28] &gt;&gt; to have a relationship with him, to have
[42:31] a love affair with him. Amen.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; The prophet will say, I will send a
[42:35] letter to my wife and I would write it
[42:37] and I write it. Any other person will
[42:39] take it and read it and won't see
[42:41] anything. What is he talking about? Is
[42:43] he doesn't understand? Maybe can read
[42:45] the word. baby. Can I have a picture of
[42:47] it? But my wife, when she's reading that
[42:49] letter, she knows what I'm talking about
[42:53] because she loves me. It's a It's a love
[42:56] letter. Amen.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; The Bible is a love letter. You need You
[42:59] need to be in love with God. To know
[43:02] God, you need to be in love with God to
[43:04] have that personal relationship with
[43:06] God. Amen. To know his ways, to know his
[43:09] nature, to Oh, praise be to God.
[43:13] The law was there given but the people
[43:16] did not know God behind the law.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; The law was not given to condemn people
[43:21] and to do this and that. But if someone
[43:24] could go into that channel and realize,
[43:26] oh God is love. Even in the law, you
[43:29] realize that everything is about love.
[43:31] Because if you really love God, you
[43:34] don't consider it as a law anymore
[43:36] because you express the love towards
[43:37] him. Amen. The same thing about if you
[43:39] know God is unveiled to you with love.
[43:43] It's not a law anymore. It's a
[43:45] relationship. Amen.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; No one knows me as better than my wife
[43:52] knows me.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because because she loves me and I
[43:56] love her. We we tell each other secrets
[43:59] and we we know each other. There is
[44:01] another level of knowledge that where
[44:04] we can go even to the capstone. It's
[44:07] another level of knowledge when you know
[44:09] each other so well becomes one. Amen.
[44:12] And that's what God desire that we know
[44:14] each other. He knows that now we need to
[44:16] know him to a greater level.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that the desire as Paul said, I
[44:22] believe and I pray that you come your
[44:24] knowledge of God increases. Not becomes
[44:27] a static nor become like the pastor pray
[44:29] no I know it all. I can't learn anything
[44:32] but God give me more of yourself. Let me
[44:34] know you more. Let me know you more.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; We will go through the Sunday special
[44:40] meetings here. Whatever God has in
[44:43] store, oh God, I want to know you more.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; If there is a way I can raise, I can
[44:48] change the way you can correct me. If
[44:50] there's a place you want to rebuke me,
[44:52] Lord, let your will be done. I desire to
[44:54] learn more. I desire to know you in a
[44:56] greater way. Lord, I want to do exploit
[44:59] in my family. I want to do exploit in my
[45:01] life. I want to do exploit in my
[45:03] relationship with my husband. I want to
[45:04] do exploit in the relationship with my
[45:06] children. I want to do exploit in the
[45:08] relationship even in the society. I want
[45:10] to be a better Christian. I want to do
[45:12] great exploit. What is exploit? Just to
[45:15] stand for the truth. Amen.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; Is that your desire?
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; The six-fold purpose of that of
[45:28] Gabriel's visit to Daniel. The prophet
[45:30] says as he's commenting on Daniel
[45:33] 12:9-10, he says, "Many shall be
[45:35] purified and made white and tried by the
[45:38] wicked shall be shall do wickedly and
[45:40] none of the wicked shall understand, but
[45:42] the wise shall understand. The end time
[45:45] message shall reveal it." The last
[45:47] church age says, "Glory, oh few," says
[45:51] there you are. Oh my, it shakes me to
[45:54] think it. The mystery, the things that
[45:57] the church world bats their eyes and say
[45:59] that nonsense. The mystery of who Jesus
[46:02] Christ was. Not the third person, not a
[46:05] second person, not a third person, but
[46:07] the person of God. All the all these
[46:11] other mysteries of God will be revealed
[46:13] because it's written here in this book
[46:15] and be revealed to the end time
[46:17] generation.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; They can almost see it in seminaries or
[46:21] schools or denominations. Then the Jews
[46:23] could see Jesus being the Messiah. No
[46:26] wonder they cry to think they no wonder
[46:29] they try to think you are crazy. No
[46:31] wonder they think you are foolish. No
[46:33] wonder they can't understand why you
[46:35] don't pluck up with them because there
[46:37] is a power and a vision behind it. A
[46:40] word of God has been revealed to get the
[46:42] church in order for the rapture and the
[46:45] going home.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; I know there is a in the Daniel 12 there
[46:49] is a connection with the 144,000
[46:52] But remember there's a connection there
[46:54] because it's the part of prophecy that
[46:56] also fulfills for them. But remember if
[47:00] that's prophecy applies to them that
[47:03] those they'll be purified. They will be
[47:05] made white. Remember they won't receive
[47:08] any message that is greater than the
[47:10] message that we have received.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; The 144 will not have another greater
[47:16] perfect message than the one that we
[47:18] have received. The same message if the
[47:20] message that they will receive is the
[47:22] message that we have received. If is
[47:24] purifying them is making them white.
[47:27] It's purifying us today and it is making
[47:29] us white today because we have received
[47:32] the perfect message of God. The
[47:34] unveiling of the word of God we have
[47:36] received it. Amen.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; So if we dare to receive something that
[47:40] will make them whiter and purify them,
[47:42] we have received the same message that
[47:44] will make us whiter and purify us today.
[47:46] Amen. So we should cherish it. We should
[47:49] love it. We should pray God. I desire to
[47:51] know more about what the word of God
[47:53] says about me. Amen. That's what we
[47:56] desire. And he says here because it's
[47:58] written this book and be revealed to the
[47:59] end time generation because there is a
[48:02] power say they cannot no more see it in
[48:05] seminaries and schools and denomination
[48:07] than the Jews could see Jesus being the
[48:09] Messiah. Through the church ages through
[48:12] the church ages in the age of of of man
[48:15] anointing. If you see Luther, if you see
[48:18] Wesley, even some of the Pentecostal,
[48:21] it's a man anointing.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; It means they have they had intelligence
[48:26] only the intelligence of man, they had
[48:28] read the Bible from the beginning to the
[48:30] to the end. If you see the monks and all
[48:34] the people staying, the priest on that
[48:36] time, even Luther, they had to write the
[48:38] word of God. They had to read it. They
[48:39] had to look in Greek. They had to look
[48:41] this and this. So they know the word of
[48:43] God so so much. like in the same time of
[48:47] Jesus Christ those scribes they that's
[48:50] what they were doing they just reading
[48:51] the word of God making sure that he's
[48:53] coping properly and everything but they
[48:56] miss to see the Messiah
[48:58] &gt;&gt; that's right
[48:59] &gt;&gt; they see to see the Messiah amen the
[49:01] same thing here for those of the ages
[49:03] they read the Bible back and forth back
[49:05] and forth but they couldn't see the
[49:08] opening of the seals amen but in our age
[49:12] by God's grace taking a seventh grade
[49:15] ministers Seven great man through him
[49:18] the angel not not him who revealed the
[49:20] seals but the lamb of God reveal the
[49:22] seals and pass it to him. Now we have
[49:25] the knowledge of God's will in our time.
[49:29] God's will cannot be given by a person
[49:32] by your own intellect. Amen. God's will
[49:34] is revealed by the messenger of the age
[49:37] and the messenger of the age gives us to
[49:39] the bride and the bride will be need
[49:42] needs to be eager or desiring to know
[49:45] more
[49:45] &gt;&gt; from what has been given to her. Amen.
[49:48] Elijah Elzo tell me more.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; But I just I was just rejoicing to know
[49:58] that God has opened the word of God.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God has opened the word of God
[50:03] for one purpose to get the church in
[50:05] order for the rapture and for the going
[50:08] home. That's why he has opened the word
[50:10] of God. That's why he has increased the
[50:13] knowledge of even of the word of God
[50:15] because in order to prepare for the
[50:17] rapture and the going home the others
[50:20] could not even though they read things
[50:22] they could not have the real knowledge
[50:23] of it because it was not their season.
[50:26] But as it is our season to know God in a
[50:30] greater way. Amen.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; So what is the knowledge of God? Just
[50:37] summarize it. The Bible says in John
[50:40] 17:3, "This is life eternal that I might
[50:43] know thee, the only true God and Jesus
[50:46] Christ whom that has the sent." So
[50:49] knowledge is to know him, the person of
[50:51] the Lord Jesus Christ, God himself.
[50:55] Amen. And if you want to desire God, I
[50:57] desire the knowledge of you yourself.
[51:00] The Bible gives us a hint. It says in
[51:02] Proverbs 9:10, the fear of the Lord is
[51:05] the beginning of wisdom. And the for and
[51:08] the knowledge of the holy is
[51:09] understanding. So if you want to have
[51:11] more knowledge of God, God give me the
[51:14] fear to fear your word to obey your
[51:17] word.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. John 1 John 2:34 says, "Hereby we
[51:21] do know that we know him if we keep his
[51:24] commandments and he that saith, I know
[51:27] him or I know God and keep not God's
[51:29] commandment is a liar and the truth is
[51:32] not in him."
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know God. I know God. But you
[51:36] don't follow God's commandment, you
[51:37] don't know him.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; You need to, if you know him, you should
[51:42] follow God's commandment. Oh, God, help
[51:44] us, Lord.
[51:46] Amen.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; That doesn't stay only lips service but
[51:50] it becomes in action in life manifested
[51:53] in all that we do in our lives in our
[51:55] families and everywhere. Father we
[51:58] cannot know God unless God reveals
[52:01] himself. He does he is through his word
[52:04] his spirit and ultimately through
[52:08] the Holy Spirit. Amen. That's what we
[52:10] desire. The prophet says
[52:13] in I'll be closing to prepare for for
[52:16] prayer
[52:18] because the things in Hebrews chapter 7
[52:21] they know him in a form and a ritual
[52:23] like our first lesson said they don't
[52:25] know him by the way of perfection. We
[52:29] need to know God in the way of
[52:31] perfection. How to know God the way of
[52:33] perfection? You need to be born again
[52:35] because the things of the world is
[52:37] foolish to the wisdom of this world. But
[52:39] the things of the world is carnal to the
[52:42] believer. The things of the world is
[52:44] carnal to the believer. If you are so
[52:46] you are a different person. You are
[52:48] living in a different sphere. You're no
[52:51] more of this world. You have passed from
[52:53] this life on for this life onto a new
[52:56] life. That's where you can testify and
[52:58] say I know God but I desire to know him
[53:01] more and more. Amen.
[53:03] Amen.
[53:06] Amen.
[53:08] I believe Daniel knew the importance of
[53:10] prayer. Daniel knew the importance of
[53:13] going back to the scroll. Daniel knew
[53:15] the importance of purposing in his heart
[53:18] to serve God. That's why he could say
[53:21] with a certainty those who know God mean
[53:24] those who follow God's commandment those
[53:27] who know the importance of the prayer
[53:29] and importance of of of of the word of
[53:31] God importance of being determined to
[53:34] serve God they will certainly do exploit
[53:37] by God's grace because God is being be
[53:40] doing the work through them. Amen.
[53:42] Daniel heard the seven thunders. He
[53:45] heard the seven thunders but it was
[53:46] forbidden to him to write down about
[53:49] them. But there will be a bride that
[53:51] will hear the seven thunders. They will
[53:54] understand the seven thunders. They will
[53:56] obey the seven thunders. They will live
[53:59] by the seven thunders. They there is no
[54:01] other choice but to do great exploits
[54:04] through through them. I believe that
[54:06] with all my heart. It's not me doing it
[54:09] but God's doing the work through him.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. As Daniel heard the seven, the
[54:13] prophet say Ephesians church 8. As
[54:15] Daniel heard the seven thunders and
[54:17] forbidden and John heard the voices and
[54:20] his book was sealed and the back of the
[54:22] book was sealed with seven seals. But in
[54:24] the days of these seals to be open, the
[54:27] mystery of God will be finished. In
[54:29] other words, God will be known to his
[54:32] church.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; God will be known to his church. Mean
[54:35] God will unveil himself to his church.
[54:38] We are so privileged to go to know God
[54:41] being unveiled. The mighty God unveiled
[54:44] before us. Amen. That's what privilege
[54:47] how privileged we are to know God and to
[54:50] know God in front and we continue to
[54:52] know him. But we know him better than
[54:54] the other ages. Why? Because he's
[54:57] preparing us for the rapture.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:10] 1 Corinthians 13 the Bible says I'll
[55:13] just read few parts he says
[55:16] charity never fail us whether there will
[55:18] be prophecies they shall fail whe there
[55:20] be tongues they shall cease whether
[55:21] there be knowledge they shall vanish
[55:23] away for we know in part and we prophesy
[55:26] in part but when which is prophet is
[55:28] come that which is in part shall be done
[55:30] away when I was a child I spake as a
[55:33] child I understood as as a child. I
[55:34] thought as a child but when I became a
[55:37] man I put away childish things mean at
[55:40] certain point we understand and we
[55:42] understand we know as a child but the
[55:44] more God is increasing the more we start
[55:47] understanding and we know more as an
[55:49] adult and we are living in the age where
[55:52] we should be living as adult. Amen.
[55:55] Means we know but we know but the the
[55:58] knowledge that we have is not only our
[56:00] heads knowledge but is know that need to
[56:03] be mixed with God's love because
[56:05] knowledge without love it just makes you
[56:08] like and know it all but when you know
[56:11] with the love of God amen you know the
[56:14] love of God in you then he makes that
[56:17] love that knowledge you have to put it
[56:19] into practice through life it's not only
[56:22] a head knowledge it becomes a life
[56:25] knowledge. Amen.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; As I said before,
[56:35] so as we go into it, our desire believe
[56:38] is still Lord, I want to know you more
[56:42] because to do great exploit is to know
[56:45] to stand for the right purpose. Even in
[56:48] the midst of trials, still say, God,
[56:51] you're in control of every situation. I
[56:54] trust you.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; I don't know how it will end up, but I
[56:57] just trust you, Lord, that you'll make
[56:59] everything right
[57:01] &gt;&gt; because I know that you'll never lie. As
[57:03] the prophet says, if you have the real
[57:05] knowledge of God, you know that God
[57:07] cannot lie. No matter how time it takes,
[57:10] no matter the difficulties, but you know
[57:12] that God can never lie.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; God will make his word to come to pass.
[57:17] And I should stand on that and say, God,
[57:19] you are faithful. God, your word can
[57:22] never fail. God, you can never lie. The
[57:24] heaven and earth will pass away, but
[57:26] your word will stand, Lord. That's where
[57:28] I'm standing. And if I stand that, God
[57:30] will come and back up his own word
[57:32] through you. Amen. And you will see the
[57:34] great exploit, the great things, the
[57:36] great miracles, the great things that
[57:37] God will do because God can never fail.
[57:40] He has never failed one of his promises.
[57:42] And he won't fail that in your life
[57:44] either. Amen. So keep pressing on. Keep
[57:46] pressing on. God, you are in control
[57:48] over these situations. How do I know?
[57:50] Because your word says so. Amen.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; And that give me that perfect knowledge
[57:55] of knowing that God your word can never
[57:57] fail. Amen.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Notice this great masterpiece of the
[58:02] family. Say the husband and wife cannot
[58:05] be truly a family unless they are one.
[58:08] They have to be. If they are not, they
[58:10] are not a good family. Wife pulling one
[58:13] way, the husband another. They will make
[58:15] a noful family. But in agreement with
[58:18] love one to another, there is that a
[58:20] family. Now that was God's masterpiece.
[58:23] Now all the true family all now all true
[58:27] all the true family here portrays that.
[58:30] Now the masterpiece family has come
[58:32] again. Christ and his bride ready to
[58:35] come. The second Adam, second Eve now
[58:38] ready to return back to their home. The
[58:40] whole picture has been redemption for
[58:42] what it was. Bring it back. See just
[58:44] exactly bring it back again. What I want
[58:47] to say with that is say God as we go to
[58:50] our special meetings and I want this to
[58:51] be a prayer as well for the special
[58:53] meetings. God I desire to see that
[58:55] masterpiece family
[58:57] &gt;&gt; because between you Christ and the bride
[59:00] and me personally not only the full
[59:02] church but myself personally I want to
[59:04] see that masterpiece that union. What
[59:07] you want that what I desire to do what
[59:10] what you want becomes my desire. Your
[59:12] desire is my first desire as well Lord.
[59:15] That's what I desire. but also in our
[59:17] families. Lord, we desire to portray
[59:19] that true relationship that you have
[59:22] with the bride that the good husband
[59:24] will love his wife. The wife respect the
[59:27] husband, the children love one another,
[59:29] love their father and the father
[59:31] respects them and the mother respect
[59:33] them. Is that the desire of your heart?
[59:35] &gt;&gt; I believe God will fulfill his word.
[59:37] Amen.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Musicians can come and just record the
[59:41] word of God. It's a prayer.
[1:00:06] I will cast all my cares upon you. If
[1:00:10] you don't know that you can sing,

[1:05:23] um I just want to thank the Lord for
[1:05:24] healing my foot. Um it was I was
[1:05:28] claiming healing for it and the Lord had
[1:05:30] touched it and then um Satan tried to
[1:05:34] give me a bunch of symptoms again after
[1:05:36] um I had thanked the Lord for my healing
[1:05:39] and the pain had gone and then it came

[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Family. Um,

[1:08:02] at the funeral everybody was testifying
[1:08:04] even though she wasn't a mess believer
[1:08:07] but she was the way how she was praying
[1:08:09] and everything and encouraging other
[1:08:11] people to know God. And I want to thank
[1:08:14] God for um because I was having trouble
[1:08:17] controlling my uh emotions even when I
[1:08:20] was coming home.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; I could feel the grief creeping me like
[1:08:23] into me. So I prayed. I said God you are
[1:08:26] not confused. You took her at the right
[1:08:28] time. This is the appointed time that
[1:08:30] you had planned that she will go even
[1:08:32] though it's difficult for us. Please
[1:08:34] Lord take I don't want to sin against
[1:08:36] you thinking like you made a mistake or
[1:08:38] something.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Take away this pain and the and he gave
[1:08:41] me peace. So I want to thank God for

[1:09:01] difficult time where we can easily think
[1:09:04] ask the question why why me? Why our
[1:09:06] family? Why this? But if God gives you
[1:09:09] that peace, it's a it's a miracle.
[1:09:12] God bless you.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Thanks. I want to thank
[1:09:17] God for healing me. Yesterday I was s I
[1:09:21] was seriously sick
[1:09:23] starting morning. I went to work. I was
[1:09:27] feeling my pain in my stomach.
[1:09:30] I keep driving.
[1:09:33] But
[1:09:35] when I arrived to work, I couldn't make
[1:09:38] it. I called my husband. I called my
[1:09:42] husband. Please pray for me. He prayed.
[1:09:48] I keep feeling that pain. I went to

[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:04] Amen.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Hello everyone. Um I have two
[1:10:07] prayer requests. one on for me and then
[1:10:10] one on behalf of one of my brothers. For
[1:10:12] my brother, he has not been working for
[1:10:15] about two years now and it's starting to
[1:10:17] really get to him. We're here visiting
[1:10:19] our family, but we're in Ontario and
[1:10:22] Ontario right now with the jobs, it's
[1:10:24] not it. So, if we can just pray for him
[1:10:27] to get a job, he's been using a lot of
[1:10:29] like defeist language like, "Oh, maybe
[1:10:31] I'm cursed. Maybe the law." So, I think
[1:10:34] it's deeper than a job. I think it's
[1:10:37] character and like the language that he
[1:10:39] uses. And for me, like I said, we're
[1:10:42] visiting our family, but I moved in
[1:10:45] Ontario with some of my siblings. We
[1:10:49] live in a Christian neighborhood and
[1:10:51] there's a whole bunch of churches that I
[1:10:53] just don't believe have the truth. And I
[1:10:56] don't believe that they fear God. And
[1:10:59] I'm praying for a church that fears the
[1:11:01] Lord and that my family can go there and
[1:11:04] we have the community that we need.
[1:11:07] Amen. God bless you, man. Amen.
[1:11:12] Amen.
[1:11:20] God bless you, Saint.
[1:11:23] This morning when I woke up, I was
[1:11:25] getting ready to uh start off to go to
[1:11:29] work, but I noticed that I had like hard
[1:11:32] time breathing. So, I called someone
[1:11:35] that morning. And then I just told her
[1:11:38] that, "No, can you sister can you pray
[1:11:40] for me cuz I'm about to go to work, but
[1:11:43] I feel like something is choking my
[1:11:45] throat and I can't breathe." So after
[1:11:48] she prayed, God healed me and I can
[1:11:52] testify that he has healed me.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Praise be to God.
[1:11:57] Praise be to God.
[1:12:00] Praise be to God. Thank you for all the
[1:12:01] testimonies. Thank you mama. Thank you
[1:12:04] brother Goshan. Thank my dear sister the
[1:12:06] request. God is working. God is doing.
[1:12:09] And I I like the the way it is you know
[1:12:13] when you're in need. We are one body. So
[1:12:15] if you're in need, call someone else and
[1:12:17] pray together. God works. The life is
[1:12:20] through the body. Amen. So keep keep
[1:12:23] doing that. Thank God for that. And God
[1:12:25] is working. We love we appreciate the
[1:12:27] Lord and thank God for that. Thank you.

[1:12:32] of one song. Then you can sing.

[1:28:26] the word of God that was spoken to us
[1:28:29] through our brother.
[1:28:33] And we thank you, Lord, for
[1:28:37] your love, mercy, and grace in our life.
[1:28:43] We thank you, Lord, uh
[1:28:46] that you're a God that
[1:28:49] still on the throne
[1:28:53] and you know all things, Lord Jesus.
[1:28:56] You see all things.
[1:29:00] There's nothing, Lord, too great or too
[1:29:02] small for you, Lord.
[1:29:07] We stand here Lord
[1:29:10] this evening.
[1:29:11] [Music]
[1:29:13] The bride of Christ on display to the
[1:29:15] world that
[1:29:18] a world Lord that knows you not.
[1:29:22] We're living in a time and age, Lord,
[1:29:24] where
[1:29:26] more than ever before,
[1:29:28] [Music]
[1:29:30] our light
[1:29:32] that it would shine for that soul that's
[1:29:35] out there that's crying out

[1:29:46] Lord, be a friend. Lord, without
[1:29:49] judgment, but through love, Lord,
[1:29:54] because love conquers all things.
[1:29:59] Because of the world we live in, it's
[1:30:02] such
[1:30:03] full of hate that
[1:30:06] they don't even know how to express
[1:30:07] love.
[1:30:11] How can you express love if you don't
[1:30:13] have the love of God in you?
[1:30:17] Lord, we thank you for brother Moses
[1:30:20] tonight for
[1:30:23] giving us the word, Lord. And
[1:30:26] as we leave here tonight, oh, Father

[1:30:54] Without you, Lord, we're nothing.
[1:30:58] You've given us everything abundantly
[1:31:00] and more.
[1:31:02] But above all,

[1:31:05] we have you, Lord Jesus. We have each
[1:31:08] other, Lord Jesus. and we have our
[1:31:11] families
[1:31:13] and that's so important Lord Jesus to
[1:31:16] have the family to be united together
[1:31:20] and Lord that
[1:31:23] we could just agree to disagree
[1:31:27] and move on and just love one another
[1:31:29] unconditionally. Lord,
[1:31:32] just be with my brothers and sisters as
[1:31:34] we leave here tonight. Lord Jesus,
[1:31:38] just walk with them, Lord Jesus. Just

[1:31:45] Lord Jesus, and all the meetings that
[1:31:48] are coming up, the the special meetings,
[1:31:50] Lord. May you just prepare our souls,
[1:31:53] Lord, for the meetings that are coming
[1:31:55] up, Lord.
[1:31:57] May we just go in much in prayer, Father
[1:32:00] God, to search, Lord, what
[1:32:04] you would have for us, Lord Jesus.
[1:32:06] That's my prayer. That's my desire, just
[1:32:09] to have a little closer walk with you,
[1:32:13] Father God.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we're just
[1:32:18] living in these unredeemed bodies, Lord,
[1:32:20] that fail you every day.
[1:32:23] But that blood, oh that precious blood
[1:32:26] covers us, Lord Jesus, an amazing grace.
[1:32:30] We thank you for that, Lord Jesus.
[1:32:33] Oh, blessed be your holy name, Father
[1:32:35] God.
[1:32:37] Thank you, Father God, for the
[1:32:38] testimonies tonight, Lord Jesus.
[1:32:41] Lord, and for the unspoken request,
[1:32:44] Lord. And we know, Lord, that even
[1:32:46] behind the scenes, we may not see
[1:32:49] things, but we know you're working
[1:32:50] behind the scenes, Lord. And we know all
[1:32:53] thing know that all things will work out
[1:32:56] for the good for those that that love
