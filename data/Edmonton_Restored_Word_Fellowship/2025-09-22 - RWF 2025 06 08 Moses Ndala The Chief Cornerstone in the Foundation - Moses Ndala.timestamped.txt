[0:18] [Music]
[0:46] Once my soul
[0:48] was a stray
[0:51] from the heavenly
[0:54] way.
[0:56] And I'm
[0:59] in
[1:01] as could be,
[1:07] but my savior
[1:10] above
[1:12] gave me peace,
[1:14] joy, and love.
[1:17] when he reached
[1:20] down his hand
[1:22] for me.
[1:28] When he reached
[1:30] down his hand
[1:33] for me.
[1:38] When he reached
[1:40] way down
[1:43] for me,
[1:48] I was lost
[1:50] and undone
[1:53] without God
[1:55] or his son.
[1:58] When he reached way down
[2:03] me,
[2:07] I was nearing
[2:10] despair
[2:12] when he came to me there
[2:16] and he showed
[2:19] me that I
[2:21] could be free.
[2:26] Then he lifted
[2:28] my feet,
[2:30] gave me gloryy
[2:33] complete.
[2:35] When he reached down his hand for me.
[2:44] When he reached down his hand for me.
[2:54] When he reached
[2:56] way down
[2:58] for me,
[3:03] I was lost
[3:05] and undone
[3:08] without God
[3:10] or his son.
[3:12] when he reached way down
[3:17] for me.
[3:22] How my heart doth rejoice
[3:26] since I made
[3:29] him my choice.
[3:31] From the tempest
[3:34] to him,
[3:35] now I cling.
[3:40] Now I lean
[3:42] on his arms.
[3:44] I'm secure
[3:47] from a heart. Since I reach down his
[3:52] hand for me.
[3:58] Since he reach down his hand for me.
[4:07] Hy reach
[4:10] way down for me.
[4:16] I was lost and undone
[4:21] without God
[4:23] or his son
[4:25] when he reached
[4:28] down his hand for me.
[4:34] Since my Lord
[4:37] gave me peace,
[4:39] heavenly joy
[4:41] never cease.
[4:44] Lord, I give
[4:46] all my life
[4:48] unto thee.
[4:52] You guide my feet,
[4:55] hold my hand.
[4:57] Grant with thee may I stand.
[5:01] Oh, he reached down his hand for me.
[5:07] When he reached
[5:10] When he reached down his hand for me,
[5:19] when he reached way down for me,
[5:28] I was lost
[5:30] and undone
[5:33] without God
[5:35] or his son when he reached down his hand
[5:42] for me.
[5:45] Amen. Welcome. God bless.

[9:19] We went for a hike yesterday with the
[9:21] family and we went down through like a
[9:23] river valley and and My youngest
[9:26] daughter was just right beside me and if
[9:28] I walked like 10 feet in front of her,
[9:30] she was like, "Wait, wait, wait, wait,
[9:31] wait, wait." And any we're crossing
[9:34] stones and the river and rocks and and
[9:36] she always needed to take my hand and
[9:38] just reminded me of the Lord. I don't
[9:40] know where I'd be if I couldn't grab the
[9:42] hand of my father and have him lead me
[9:44] and and pick me up if I fall or steady
[9:48] me if I'm slipping and Yeah.
[9:56] He paid a debt.
[10:05] He paid a debt he did not owe. I owed a
[10:13] debt I could not pay. I needed
[10:19] someone
[10:22] to wash my sins away.
[10:29] And now I sing a brand new song.
[10:35] Amazing
[10:37] grace
[10:38] all day long. Christ Jesus paid a debt
[10:45] that I could never pay.
[10:52] He paid a debt on Calary.
[10:58] He cleansed my soul and he set me free.
[11:04] I'm glad that Jesus
[11:08] did all my sins erased.
[11:15] I now can sing a brand new song.
[11:21] Amazing grace
[11:24] all day long. Christ Jesus paid a debt
[11:31] that I could never pay. One day,
[11:38] one day he's coming back for me to live
[11:45] with him
[11:47] eternally.
[11:49] Don't it be glory
[11:54] to see him on that day.
[12:01] I then will sing a brand new song.
[12:07] Amazing grace
[12:10] all day long. Christ Jesus paid a debt
[12:16] that I could never pay. He paid a debt.
[12:23] He paid a debt at Calary.
[12:29] He cleansed my soul and he set me free.

[13:22] traveling in a little while home.

[36:15] That's what we desire. Old time
[36:18] religion. Amen.
[36:20] I I I would you please stand up and just
[36:25] read the word of God and go to the word
[36:26] of God. Thank you, brother Andrew,
[36:29] brother Caleb and Sister Wendy. God
[36:32] bless you richly.
[36:45] What will we do without a song service
[36:50] to help us to wake up to prepare our
[36:54] ground for the word of God to come? So
[36:57] we thank God for the song service. I
[37:00] invite you to go to Ephesians chapter 4
[37:06] has been mentioned brother of Peter
[37:07] still traveling and and different ones
[37:10] and
[37:12] thank you for those who have uh
[37:16] told me that they won't make it for this
[37:18] Sunday morning
[37:20] bit busy on different things or maybe
[37:22] work something else but appreciate that
[37:25] God bless you richly wherever they are
[37:27] just pray for them as well God bless
[37:30] and um those couldn't make it. Amen.
[37:34] Ephesians 4 11
[37:38] says God
[37:41] he gave some apostles and some prophets
[37:44] and some evangelists and some pastors
[37:47] and teachers
[37:50] for what purpose? For the perfecting of
[37:52] the saints.
[37:54] So the ministry has one purpose is the
[37:57] perfecting of the saints for those who
[38:00] have been sanctified but they need to
[38:02] come to perfection and continues for the
[38:05] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[38:08] the body of Christ till we all come in
[38:12] the unity of the faith and of the
[38:14] knowledge of the son of God unto a
[38:18] perfect man unto the measure of the
[38:21] stature of the fullness of Christ
[38:26] that we henceforth be no more children
[38:29] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[38:32] every wind of doctrine but the slight of
[38:36] man of man and cunning craftiness
[38:39] whereby they lie in weight to deceive
[38:43] but speaking the truth in love may grow
[38:46] up into him in all things which is the
[38:50] head even Christ we just bow our head
[38:53] once Once again, Father Lord, we thank
[38:54] you for making us able to read the word,
[38:58] the letters of this book. Father Lord,
[39:01] as we thank you for the message of the
[39:03] hour doesn't come, Father, he came to
[39:07] give us, Father, the revelation behind
[39:10] the scripture. Father, we pray that this
[39:12] morning that the same Holy Spirit will
[39:14] come, the one who wrote the word of God
[39:17] will come to give us the context behind
[39:20] the letters that have been written.
[39:22] prepare our heart father to receive what
[39:24] you have in store as father going in
[39:28] this in this path maybe for a longer
[39:31] longer teaching but father we pray that
[39:34] that holy spirit will lead us in every
[39:35] step father we commit oursel to you in
[39:38] Jesus Christ name bless your people and
[39:41] once again lord we trust in you for our
[39:43] needs in Jesus Christ's name amen can
[39:47] have your seat
[39:48] amen
[39:59] I give him
[40:02] give it a thought this morning um as a
[40:04] starting I would like to I'm thinking to
[40:07] go in a path maybe go as a as a teaching
[40:12] for
[40:13] for I don't know for how long it will
[40:15] take but
[40:17] um go every step maybe to go I'll show
[40:21] I'll show what the desire was the
[40:22] prophet and I just went in that same
[40:25] vein and when I read the prophet and I
[40:27] just thought that it was also good to go
[40:28] in that vein so um
[40:32] the the pro or the desire of God or the
[40:35] desire of God is as writing to the
[40:37] Ephesians day we don't he doesn't want
[40:39] us to remain children he wants us to be
[40:42] grown up I think brother um Gilbert has
[40:46] in leading us a little bit in that path
[40:48] in the adoption and u and we thank God
[40:52] and we'll be preaching next Sunday as
[40:54] well and might add more on that but I
[40:57] would likely be to go and as the pro as
[41:00] the Bible says and the prophet will say
[41:01] it again Bible says till we all come in
[41:04] the unity of the faith and the knowledge
[41:06] of the son of God unto a perfect man
[41:10] perfect man does not mean a man without
[41:12] mistakes or sinless person or spotless
[41:16] person. It's a person doesn't doesn't
[41:20] stumble here and there. But perfect man
[41:23] means a complete man means a man who's
[41:26] mature. Man who knows where he's
[41:28] standing. A man who's a who's stable. A
[41:31] man who's established man or woman
[41:34] established know position know where
[41:36] he's standing. Amen. Now unto the
[41:38] measure of the statue of the fullness of
[41:41] Christ. The statue of the fullness of
[41:44] Christ. And that what the prophet will
[41:45] preach a message the statue of the
[41:47] perfect man. And that's what I would
[41:50] like to go a little bit deeper on that
[41:52] and says we ask forth no more children
[41:56] tossed to and fro. You know we can be a
[41:59] child of God. We can be born again. We
[42:02] can even be in the message. But um we
[42:05] are not we are not we are not spared
[42:08] from different doctrines that can come
[42:10] here and different things, different
[42:12] ideas. sometimes our own ideas and other
[42:15] people's ideas and we be shaken if we
[42:18] are not completely stable. So it would
[42:21] be good to go a little bit on on some of
[42:23] the simple things that we know but we
[42:26] just reestablish them and just reaffirm
[42:30] them again. Amen. How many were blessed
[42:32] when brother Toby was here and then he
[42:35] spoke to us about the prophet and
[42:38] something we all believe but just to go
[42:40] back to the the we can call it the
[42:42] element of the basis or the foundation
[42:45] but just stir your heart a little bit
[42:46] more oh actually that's where I started
[42:49] and it's still alive today and as the
[42:52] church as many people at different
[42:54] stages different places the mature one
[42:57] can be more um can be more tolerant to
[43:01] accept to go to the basics to help all
[43:03] the church go. We don't want just few.
[43:05] We don't want just the the senior pastor
[43:08] to go in the rapture or or the deacon to
[43:11] go in the rapture or the pastor to go in
[43:12] the rapture and the rest to stay. No,
[43:14] that's not what we want. We want all of
[43:16] us to go in the rapture. So the little
[43:18] ones and those who are in middle age and
[43:21] those who are grown up, all of us we
[43:23] desire to go in the rapture. So that so
[43:26] just bear with me. I will be going a
[43:28] little bit in some element things but I
[43:31] think it's important to go back to that
[43:33] as well. Amen. So that's why took a
[43:35] little bit of time to put that
[43:36] introduction. So second Peter's one
[43:39] where the prophet took that thought.
[43:42] Second Peter 1 as you are sitting says
[43:44] according as his divine power has given
[43:47] unto us all things that pertain unto
[43:50] life and godliness
[43:52] through the knowledge of him that had
[43:53] called us to glory and virtue. last time
[43:56] we talk about the glory of God. So
[43:58] that's where we have been called to to
[44:00] come to glory and virtue whereby are
[44:03] given unto us exceeding great and
[44:05] precious promises that by these you
[44:08] might be partakers of the divine nature.
[44:12] So God has given us promises in his word
[44:14] so that we can become partakers of his
[44:17] divine nature. Born in this flesh, born
[44:20] from our mothers and fathers, we have
[44:23] this fleshly nature. we have we can they
[44:25] can put you in a spot they can put you
[44:27] in a in an isolated island and you grow
[44:30] and from there there's no contact with
[44:32] another person but I can guarantee you
[44:35] as you come at you come at the age of
[44:37] mature you you you automatically you
[44:39] will learn how to lie you automatically
[44:41] you will learn different things
[44:42] automatically you will know how how to
[44:44] be mean to others and no one will teach
[44:46] you that it will come from the inside
[44:48] because this flesh has been born in sin
[44:51] shaped iniquities it's bound to death
[44:54] No, it needs a change. Needs it needs a
[44:57] transformation. But God has given us
[44:59] promises so that we can become partakers
[45:02] of his divine nature. The same nature of
[45:05] God, it can be transmitted to a human
[45:07] being. And we all have the same nature
[45:10] as God himself. Think about it. And
[45:12] having, and the Bible continues, having
[45:14] escaped the corruption that is in the
[45:16] world through lust, beside this, giving
[45:18] all diligence. Giving all diligence. So
[45:21] there is one part of the there's one
[45:24] part you can see the word of God as two
[45:26] component place. There is a place where
[45:28] God is doing the work and it is still
[45:30] God doing the work. We didn't choose
[45:32] ourself. God who chose us. Amen. We
[45:34] didn't um we didn't we can't perfect
[45:36] yourself. God has to perfect you. But it
[45:38] needs sometimes a collaboration with
[45:40] God. Sometimes God requires also a
[45:43] feedback. Amen. He wants to see a
[45:45] feedback from his child. He wants his
[45:47] feedback from his son or his daughter so
[45:49] that you can mature and become and and
[45:51] come actually to your position. Adoption
[45:54] is actually you are a son. I mean God
[45:56] doesn't deny that you are a daughter.
[45:58] God does not deny that. But to come to
[46:00] the adoption is when the son recognizes
[46:03] that I'm a son of God. I'm a daughter of
[46:05] God. But also want to act diligently in
[46:08] everything that God has given me and
[46:11] become responsible and become
[46:13] accountable for what God has given me.
[46:15] So you share the same responsibility as
[46:17] God of what the the same the same burden
[46:20] as God has. Amen. The burden God has for
[46:23] his kingdom. The burden that God has for
[46:25] his for his children. A son or daughter
[46:27] of God who shares the same burden who
[46:29] take that burdens upon him. God put him
[46:32] in that position of adoption. God will
[46:34] adopt him. Amen. Otherwise he's just as
[46:37] a servant. He's doing things but his
[46:38] heart is not there. He doesn't really
[46:41] care. He's just doing his job to be
[46:43] paid. But there a real son of God is the
[46:45] one who cares with the has the same
[46:47] burden whether I get a earthly reward or
[46:50] not but I still do it from the love of
[46:52] my father because I have that burden in
[46:55] my heart. Amen. It says so add with all
[46:58] diligence giving alligence add your
[47:00] faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and
[47:03] to knowledge temperance and to
[47:05] temperance patience and to patience
[47:07] godliness. So that's where all those
[47:09] virtues come from. says, "And to
[47:11] godliness, brotherly kindness, and to
[47:13] brotherly kindness, charity, and if
[47:15] these things be in you, not only be in
[47:18] you, but if these things abound in you,
[47:21] they make you that you shall neither be
[47:24] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[47:26] of our Lord Jesus Christ." So our desire
[47:29] is God, make those virtue abound in our
[47:32] life. Make them real. Make them become
[47:35] more pre predominant in our lives. We
[47:38] don't just want a portion of the just a
[47:40] portion of faith and then we touch a bit
[47:42] of faith on Wednesday. We don't just a
[47:44] small portion of faith or limit myself
[47:47] to the place where I say you know I'm a
[47:48] Christian is that all I I gave my life
[47:50] to Christ and that's all I I limit
[47:52] myself there no you need more faith God
[47:55] give me more faith give me more
[47:57] revelation give me more of yourself more
[47:59] God give me more virtue give me more of
[48:02] your power Lord is there anything
[48:03] hindering the power of God to work in my
[48:06] life Lord take it away I desire more of
[48:08] you Lord I want to I want to stay in the
[48:10] word of God I want to know you more I
[48:12] want No, no. I I I want to to increase
[48:15] my knowledge of the word of God. So a
[48:17] Christian has have to have that desire.
[48:19] A mature Christian has to have that
[48:22] burden in his heart. Amen. So they they
[48:24] make that sh but he that lack ofth these
[48:27] things is blind. They cannot see a far
[48:29] off and have forgotten that he was
[48:31] purged from his old sins. Wherefore the
[48:35] rather
[48:36] brethren give diligence to make your
[48:38] calling and election sure. Your calling
[48:41] is not yourself calling is not is not
[48:43] yourself who can elect yourself but it's
[48:46] God who has to call you is God who has
[48:48] elected you but you have to make that
[48:50] calling an election sure. Amen. You have
[48:53] also a part where you have to do God
[48:55] help me to do my part. And if you do
[48:58] these things you shall never fall. Amen.
[49:01] Are you with me this evening and this
[49:03] morning? Amen.
[49:07] Amen.
[49:09] So that statue of a perfect man is
[49:11] actually a building is actually a house
[49:14] and God desire to have a house and God
[49:17] has a desire his desire is to have a
[49:19] tabernacle his desire to have a place
[49:22] where he can live in. So if you become a
[49:25] Christian is not just to become a
[49:28] Christian is not just to be different
[49:30] from other religion. A Christian is a
[49:33] one who has to receive the Holy Ghost so
[49:35] that Christ can come and dwell inside of
[49:38] him and have the full preminence inside
[49:41] of him. Amen. The prophet says in the
[49:44] statue of the perfect man, this is the
[49:46] house that God God dwells in. Not a
[49:49] building with a big bell on top of it or
[49:52] a high stipple. See, but a body has thou
[49:55] prepared me. A body that God can dwell
[49:58] in, God can walk in, God can see in, God
[50:03] can talk in, God can work in. You have
[50:06] the Holy Spirit is because you you have
[50:10] God want to work through you. Amen. He
[50:12] want to see through you. He want to talk
[50:14] through you. He want you want he want to
[50:16] be that vessel that he can use to
[50:18] express himself. Living instrumentality
[50:22] of God. God walking in two feet in you.
[50:25] Prophet says, "Glory, the footstep of
[50:27] the righteous is ordered of God. God
[50:30] walking in you. For you are written
[50:32] epistles, read of all men. And if the
[50:35] life that's in Christ is be in you, you
[50:38] will bear the life that Christ bore."
[50:40] Amen. So it's not putting on things, but
[50:43] it's expressing the life of Jesus
[50:45] Christ. The Holy Spirit is there to put
[50:47] you in service. The Holy Spirit is not
[50:50] there only only for for you to be saved
[50:53] which is as a part of it but more than
[50:55] that is for you to be used for the
[50:58] kingdom glor for the glory of God and
[51:00] for his kingdom. 1 Peter 2 says
[51:05] 1 Peter 2:4 says to whom coming as unto
[51:08] a living stone that is allowed indeed of
[51:11] man but chosen of God and precious ye
[51:14] also as living stones are built up a
[51:17] spiritual house and holy priesthood to
[51:20] offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
[51:23] to God by Jesus Christ. Wherefore also
[51:26] it is contained the scripture, behold I
[51:29] lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, elect
[51:32] precious, and he that believeth on him
[51:36] shall not be confounded. So my subject
[51:38] this morning as a subject of them this
[51:41] morning is your chief cornerstone in the
[51:44] foundation of the house of God. Amen.
[51:47] The chief cornerstone in the foundation
[51:49] of the house of God. Amen. Says I lay in
[51:53] Zion and Seion Zion is actually the
[51:57] bride say I lay in Zion a chief
[51:59] cornerstone that cornerstone is elect
[52:02] and it's precious and he that believe on
[52:05] him shall not be confounded. So that
[52:07] stone is a person. So we have to believe
[52:09] in that stone. Says unto you therefore
[52:12] which believe is precious. But unto them
[52:15] which be disobedient, the stone which
[52:18] the builders disallowed, the same is
[52:20] made the head of the corner and a stone
[52:23] of stumbling and a rock of offense, even
[52:26] to them which stumble at the word being
[52:28] disobedient. where unto also they were
[52:31] appointed. But you are a chosen
[52:33] generation, a royal priesthood and holy
[52:36] nation, a peculiar people. Think about
[52:39] it. In God's mind, you are a chosen
[52:41] generation. You are a royal priesthood.
[52:44] You are a holy nation. You are a
[52:46] peculiar people. Amen. You know that God
[52:49] has created you for a purpose for you to
[52:52] be a son and daughter of God. You didn't
[52:54] become a son of God today. They didn't
[52:56] become even a son of God on day you gave
[52:58] your heart to the law. You are a son of
[53:00] God before the foundation of the world.
[53:03] He already thought of you. You were the
[53:04] thinking of you and he want you to
[53:07] recognize how he were thinking of you.
[53:09] Amen. That's what is the son of God.
[53:11] That's what the message comes us to tell
[53:13] us. The message comes to tell us who we
[53:15] were so that we can live as God wants us
[53:18] to live. Amen. The message is not coming
[53:21] to transform us from a pig to become a
[53:23] lamb or to become a sheep. But is coming
[53:26] to express that you are a sheep, you are
[53:28] a lamb. You are not a chicken, you are
[53:30] an eagle. Amen. You have to live like an
[53:33] eagle. You are the son and daughter of
[53:35] the king. Amen. So you have to behave
[53:37] like a son and daughter of a king.
[53:39] That's what God is saying. You are a
[53:41] chosen generation. You are a holy
[53:43] priesthood. You are a holy nation.
[53:45] Peculiar people. I have chosen you and I
[53:48] want you to come where I want you to
[53:49] come. But you have to have a solid
[53:52] foundation. You have to have what I have
[53:55] in store for you. Amen. But you should
[53:57] show for off the praises of him. But you
[53:59] show for off the praises of him which
[54:02] had called you out of darkness into this
[54:04] marvelous light which in time past was
[54:07] were not a people but but but in time
[54:10] past were not a people but are now the
[54:12] people of God. which had not obtained
[54:15] mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
[54:18] Dearly beloved, I beseech you as
[54:20] strangers and pilgrim, abstain from
[54:22] fleshly lust, which war against the
[54:25] soul. Because the real you is the soul.
[54:28] Amen. The real you is not the flesh. The
[54:31] real you is not even sometimes our mind.
[54:34] The real you is the flesh. Amen. The
[54:37] real you is inside of you, the inner
[54:39] man, the soul. Amen. That the portion of
[54:42] God. And that soul has the same nature
[54:44] as God is. The nature of the soul for a
[54:47] believer is God himself. Amen. It's not
[54:50] something different. Amen. Praise be to
[54:52] God. So exactly God has a desire to have
[54:55] a dwelling place, a place where he want
[54:57] to live. And he desire you to become you
[55:00] and I to become his vessels. He have
[55:02] created us so that we can become the
[55:05] sons and daughters of God. That's why
[55:07] God condescending to the creation. And
[55:09] he came to to to our level to pick us
[55:12] from our level to bring us to his level.
[55:14] Amen. Now that he wants to be woripped,
[55:17] the word of God means object of worship.
[55:20] The prophet says in the statue of a
[55:21] perfect man, it's God trying to
[55:24] condition his people so he can get from
[55:27] he can get from them what he created
[55:29] them for. Amen. So that's why you
[55:32] receive the word of God. That's why you
[55:34] receive the message of the hour. It's
[55:36] God trying to condition you so that you
[55:39] can so that he can get from you and me
[55:42] what he created us for. And it says he
[55:45] never made you to be something else
[55:48] beside a son and daughter of God. Amen.
[55:52] He never made you to become something
[55:54] else than the son and daughter of God.
[55:58] I love that. Amen. He never made created
[56:01] He never created me to become something
[56:03] else. I have been created to become a
[56:06] son and daughter of God. Statue of a
[56:07] perfect man. If you have missed that of
[56:10] being a son and daughter of God, you
[56:12] have missed the mark.
[56:14] So sin for a believer, for a son and a
[56:17] daughter of God to have been forain
[56:19] before the foundation of the world. Sin
[56:22] for you is when you miss to express that
[56:25] you're a son and daughter of God. Sin is
[56:28] not only what we do like cheating and
[56:30] all the different things or lying on
[56:32] different things or lust or different
[56:34] things. Those are just attribute of
[56:36] sins. Those are the things that are
[56:38] being expressed because of unbelief
[56:40] sometimes. But I would say even for the
[56:43] unbelievers those the the unbelievers is
[56:47] the one who doesn't believe the word of
[56:48] God. So he's is a he's an unbeliever to
[56:50] begin with. He's a sinner to begin with.
[56:53] But for a son and daughter of God is
[56:55] different. for a son of God of God. God
[56:57] say you know you have sinned because you
[56:59] have missed the target. You have missed
[57:01] to express that you are a son of God.
[57:03] You have missed to express that you're a
[57:04] daughter of God. You have missed to
[57:06] express what I wanted you to be. Amen.
[57:08] If God ask if you look into the word of
[57:10] God you actually is not the word is not
[57:12] there to condemn you. The word is there
[57:14] to realize oh God I've been missing this
[57:17] all the time. Now I realize oh actually
[57:20] I need to come to church. Amen. When you
[57:22] come to church, how I realize, oh, now I
[57:25] need to respect my I need to I need to
[57:27] love my wife. Oh, now I need to love my
[57:29] wife. You should love her. Actually,
[57:33] now I need to respect my husband. Oh,
[57:35] the word of God say I need to respect my
[57:37] husband. Oh. Oh, now I do it. Amen. It's
[57:40] it's not it's not a law. It's not is No,
[57:42] you realize Oh, that that's what I'm
[57:44] called to be. I'm a son and daughter of
[57:46] a girl. He's not he's not pushing me.
[57:48] He's realizing what I am. Amen. Are you
[57:51] with me? this evening. So if you miss
[57:53] that then you miss the target and say oh
[57:55] God you have sinned. Look God forgive
[57:57] me. Forgive me for my mistakes because I
[57:59] miss to to I miss to express who you
[58:01] are. I mean miss to express that I'm a
[58:03] temple of God. I mean to express that I
[58:05] want to be a vessel that God want to use
[58:07] me for. Amen. So God put here to be a
[58:10] Christians. If you're off one side come
[58:13] back and get tuned up. And there is only
[58:16] one thing that can tune you up. That's
[58:18] the scripture. The Holy Spirit in the
[58:20] scripture tunes you, brings you directly
[58:23] into the target again. We thank God for
[58:25] the message of the hour. We thank God
[58:27] for the Bible. We thank God that we can
[58:30] we can be tuned back again. If you miss
[58:32] the target, let me ask let me encourage
[58:34] you this morning. The word of God is
[58:35] here to to to help you to target again
[58:39] to to tune again so that you can you
[58:41] can't miss the target again. It brings
[58:42] you to the correction. You come to the
[58:44] house of God to be corrected. God help
[58:46] me to become a better Christians. Help
[58:49] me to help me to serve you faithfully.
[58:51] Help me to love you more. The word of
[58:53] God corrects you. Amen. The prayer
[58:55] sometimes you are in prayer and you're
[58:57] in prayer and you you go and sometimes
[58:59] you do it you go in prayer but as you go
[59:02] into prayer you realize God is speaking
[59:04] back to you. Amen. He's helping you to
[59:06] be tuned back to God. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[59:10] Amen.
[59:16] says now how that the God in his church
[59:19] the church is not supposed to be taking
[59:22] or the church is now supposed to be
[59:24] taking the place of Christ carrying on
[59:27] his ministry. He that believe on me the
[59:30] works that I do shall he do also yet a
[59:33] little while and the world see me no
[59:34] more yet you shall see me for I will be
[59:36] with you even you to the hand of the
[59:39] world there it is carrying on his work.
[59:42] So that what the church has to do is the
[59:44] church is supposed to take the place of
[59:46] Christ carrying his ministry. If Christ
[59:49] healed the sick, the church is healing
[59:51] the sick. Amen. If Christ was casting
[59:53] out demons, the church is casting out
[59:55] demons. If Christ was living a
[59:57] sanctified life, a a church is living a
[59:59] sanctified life. If Christ was raptured,
[1:00:02] the church will be raptured. Amen. Why?
[1:00:04] We are carrying on his work. Christ is
[1:00:08] using now vessels to express himself. It
[1:00:11] was God in the father, God in the son,
[1:00:13] but now God is in the church. Amen. And
[1:00:16] the church has to recognize that I need
[1:00:18] to yield myself to him. So God can use
[1:00:21] me. God has no other eyes that your
[1:00:24] eyes. God has no other mouth than your
[1:00:26] mouth. God has no other body but your
[1:00:29] body. Amen. And my body. Amen.
[1:00:33] In order to do that, he has to sanctify
[1:00:35] the vessel. He has to cleanse the
[1:00:38] vessel. Christians like
[1:00:42] these are my notes and say so Christians
[1:00:44] we all do like justification I do as
[1:00:46] well but one important part of the grace
[1:00:50] of the work of the grace of God is also
[1:00:52] sanctification the Lord sanctified me by
[1:00:55] the blood of the lord by the blood of
[1:00:57] the lamb but also sanctified me with the
[1:01:00] holy ghost so as you see as we see in
[1:01:03] this pyramid script uh structure here
[1:01:08] the proph Prophet as we look go into
[1:01:10] that says you have to go from the bottom
[1:01:12] to the top. You have to start from
[1:01:15] faith. Says you have to start from
[1:01:17] faith. You have to start from the
[1:01:20] foundation.
[1:01:22] Sometimes we want to start from the top
[1:01:25] right. We want to start from here. We
[1:01:27] want speaking tongues. We want the gift
[1:01:30] of the Holy Spirit. We want the
[1:01:31] different things. Says no, you have to
[1:01:34] start from here. You need to have a
[1:01:36] solid foundation. Amen. Make sure that
[1:01:39] your foundation is very solid. Amen. God
[1:01:43] help me that my foundation becomes very
[1:01:45] solid. Sometimes we rushed up too much
[1:01:49] to the top there. Oh, I want I I I want
[1:01:52] the money. I want to do this. I want the
[1:01:54] ministry or I want the gift of this. I
[1:01:55] want this. Those things are very good.
[1:01:58] But God, make my foundation becomes so
[1:02:01] solid.
[1:02:02] Make my my foundation becomes so
[1:02:04] established that nothing can move me,
[1:02:07] nothing can move you.
[1:02:17] And the start of the foundation,
[1:02:20] I will say it start even in Acts 2
[1:02:23] 38.
[1:02:25] When they heard this,
[1:02:29] you know the scripture very well, but
[1:02:30] I'll read it. Therefore, let all the
[1:02:32] house of Israel know assuredly that God
[1:02:35] had made the same Jesus whom he had
[1:02:36] crucified both Lord and Christ.
[1:02:40] That's why we baptize in the name of the
[1:02:42] Lord Jesus Christ because Jesus has been
[1:02:44] made Lord and Christ. Amen. So now when
[1:02:47] they heard this, they were prickled in
[1:02:48] their heart and said unto Peter and to
[1:02:51] the rest of the apostles, "Men and
[1:02:52] brethren, what shall we do?" Then Peter
[1:02:56] said unto them, "Repent."
[1:02:59] Many times we don't want to repent.
[1:03:02] We don't want to change. That's right.
[1:03:04] Repentance is a change. Repentance is a
[1:03:08] change of directions. It's a change of
[1:03:10] recognize I was wrong. And sometimes
[1:03:13] when are wrong is just to say Lord the
[1:03:16] way I have been thinking about the word
[1:03:18] of God was wrong. The way I was a
[1:03:21] conception of the duty of God was wrong.
[1:03:24] The way I had the conception of the
[1:03:27] original sin was wrong. The way I had
[1:03:30] the conception of what is a what is a
[1:03:32] church I was wrong. The way I had the
[1:03:34] conception of the new birth was wrong.
[1:03:37] Sometimes it goes even beyond saying I'm
[1:03:39] doing the wrong things and then now and
[1:03:41] I'm doing the I'm doing the good things.
[1:03:43] We have many children who are born in
[1:03:45] good houses. They have they didn't go in
[1:03:47] the world. They didn't go and but do bad
[1:03:49] things but they just be there and then
[1:03:51] doing their own work and different
[1:03:52] things. But at some point they need to
[1:03:55] have that change of mind. So God says
[1:03:58] word is is real. You know the message or
[1:04:01] the word of God is actually a reality.
[1:04:03] Christ is not a Christ of history. I can
[1:04:06] have a personal walk with God. I can
[1:04:09] talk to God. I can pray. I can dedicate
[1:04:11] my life. Lord, the change that this this
[1:04:14] is not the religion of the father only.
[1:04:16] Is not the religion of the mother only.
[1:04:18] It's actually a reality. God, I can have
[1:04:21] a personal walk with you. I can have a
[1:04:24] walk, a closer walk with you. I can love
[1:04:27] you more. I can be actually more in I
[1:04:30] can dedicate myself more. Something has
[1:04:32] to change. We need a work of repentance.
[1:04:35] Amen.
[1:04:37] Maybe we have made so many mistakes.
[1:04:39] Sometimes we have baptized people
[1:04:40] because they just say, "I'm baptized."
[1:04:42] Been born in a message and say, "Okay,
[1:04:44] baptize. I'll baptize you. I baptize."
[1:04:46] But did you go through the process of
[1:04:49] repentance? Did you go to the process?
[1:04:50] God, I recognize now that actually you
[1:04:54] want a closer walk with me. Did I go
[1:04:56] through the process, Lord, now I am
[1:04:58] determined to follow you. I am
[1:05:00] determined to serve you. I am determined
[1:05:03] whether is my father doesn't follow it
[1:05:05] anymore whether my my my my mother
[1:05:08] doesn't follow I am determined I make
[1:05:11] myself a decision to follow you
[1:05:14] sometimes we have followed our husband
[1:05:16] we have followed our wives or no no then
[1:05:18] we follow him just come then then oh one
[1:05:21] time I want to be baptized then we get
[1:05:22] baptized yeah but did you really repent
[1:05:25] Lord I I I recognize this and I I want
[1:05:29] is I I want to become what the word of
[1:05:31] God says, "I don't want just to become a
[1:05:34] a a stamp of a Christian. I want the
[1:05:36] reality of a Christian. I want I want to
[1:05:38] dedicate my life. I want to follow you.
[1:05:40] Lord, I repent for my way of thinking.
[1:05:44] Now I accept your way of thinking. Show
[1:05:47] me more as I it's not it's not an easy
[1:05:49] walk, but I want to walk with you every
[1:05:51] step. Show me the way. Let me walk with
[1:05:54] you, Lord. I want my foundation to be
[1:05:57] solid, Lord. I want to repent." Amen.
[1:06:00] The zeal that God wants is actually a
[1:06:02] zeal of repentance. It's not even the
[1:06:04] zeal of of other things, but is a zeal
[1:06:07] of repentance. Make me ready to repent.
[1:06:10] When I'm wrong, change me. When I'm
[1:06:12] wrong, correct me, Lord. I don't want to
[1:06:14] be right on my own eyes, but you, Lord,
[1:06:16] speak to me. And I want this in this
[1:06:18] work to be obedient to your word. Make
[1:06:21] me humble, Lord. Amen. Lord, you start
[1:06:24] with the real good things. Amen. I'll
[1:06:26] guarantee you God will bless you. God
[1:06:28] will bless you. God will continue adding
[1:06:31] more and more, more and more, more and
[1:06:33] more.
[1:06:34] Amen. Amen.
[1:06:36] Repentance is very very important.
[1:06:40] I would say actually repentance is not a
[1:06:42] one step. It's not the one. You continue
[1:06:44] repenting all the time. The word of God
[1:06:46] is unveiling you repent. As the word of
[1:06:49] God is unveiling, oh God, I was wrong. I
[1:06:51] repent. Lord, oh I used to think that
[1:06:54] you know know sometimes we have that
[1:06:56] idea sometimes you you look in the news
[1:06:58] or oh this person killed the other
[1:06:59] person killed the other person and the
[1:07:01] first one oh he's going to be charged
[1:07:03] and he's going to be killed we're going
[1:07:05] to put in the court and how do you say
[1:07:07] criminal how do you say the final
[1:07:09] punishment or the the judgment and the
[1:07:13] the capital punishment the capital
[1:07:15] punishment and then you feel like in
[1:07:17] your heart oh he deserves it no he
[1:07:20] doesn't deserve capital punishment Amen.
[1:07:22] The word of God comes to cleanse our
[1:07:24] minds. Oh, I used to think that he
[1:07:26] deserves it. No, he does not deserve no
[1:07:28] matter what he has done. You know, we
[1:07:29] can still give him a grace of know. Oh,
[1:07:32] no one can take someone's life. What can
[1:07:35] change that mind? Is the word of God the
[1:07:38] change? Oh my god, change me. Change me.
[1:07:41] If I'm just taking those example, but
[1:07:42] that so many things in the word of God,
[1:07:44] if we have the right attitude will be
[1:07:47] coming, Lord, I want to be changed. I
[1:07:49] want to be corrected. I want to be Lord.
[1:07:52] Amen.
[1:08:00] Say repent and be baptized every one of
[1:08:02] you in the name of Jesus Christ. In the
[1:08:05] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:08:07] of sins. It's not baptized in the name
[1:08:10] of the father, sons and holy ghost. We
[1:08:12] all know the things but in the name of
[1:08:14] the Lord Jesus Christ. Because there is
[1:08:17] only think about if we do any other
[1:08:19] things we say but we have to do any
[1:08:21] other things in the name of Jesus
[1:08:23] Christ. You pray in the name of Jesus
[1:08:24] Christ and you pray faithful in the name
[1:08:26] of Jesus Christ and you bless the other
[1:08:28] children in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:08:30] They bless your marriage in the name of
[1:08:31] Jesus Christ. Why would you refuse that
[1:08:34] the baptized not to be in the name of
[1:08:36] the Lord Jesus Christ? The baptism there
[1:08:40] is only one real baptism. It's in the
[1:08:42] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. any other
[1:08:45] baptism is not a correct baptism. Amen.
[1:08:47] Paul had to correct people who were
[1:08:49] baptized under under the ministry of
[1:08:52] John the Baptist, the same one who
[1:08:55] baptized the Lord Jesus Christ. But when
[1:08:57] Paul came says, "No, that was that was a
[1:09:00] baptism unto repentance. But now this is
[1:09:02] the real baptism. If you want to receive
[1:09:05] the gift of the Holy Ghost, you need to
[1:09:07] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:09:09] Jesus Christ." Amen. Amen.
[1:09:18] And then from that you start building.
[1:09:22] Like any building you need a solid
[1:09:24] foundation.
[1:09:26] The higher you want to go actually the
[1:09:28] deeper you want to deep.
[1:09:31] Lord I want a I want a higher I want to
[1:09:34] go in a great mountains. I want
[1:09:36] manifestations. I want the third pool. I
[1:09:39] want I want all things. I want I want to
[1:09:41] be able to create the squirrels. I want
[1:09:43] all the different things, Lord.
[1:09:46] But God is saying, but what is your
[1:09:48] foundation there?
[1:09:50] Why you struggling still on the ABCs?
[1:09:53] That's right. Why you still have this?
[1:09:56] Why still struggle struggling with the
[1:09:57] television? We are still struggling with
[1:10:00] women cutting their hair. We are still
[1:10:01] struggling with you to dress. You're
[1:10:03] still struggling with makeup. You're
[1:10:05] still struggling with gossiping. We are
[1:10:07] still struggling with, "Oh, no. Oh yeah,
[1:10:09] I don't feel like going to church.
[1:10:13] It's snowing. It's so hot.
[1:10:16] Oh, my kids. Oh, I'm I'm busy. I'm a
[1:10:18] work. Oh, but I want the third pool when
[1:10:21] the time will come when the mystery will
[1:10:23] be revealed. I will be able to speak the
[1:10:25] word. But where is your foundation?
[1:10:28] Lord, help me a foundation to be so
[1:10:30] strong. Lord, where am I Lord? my faith
[1:10:33] and those little things that the ABCs I
[1:10:36] can't even write any question of algebra
[1:10:39] if I don't know the alphabet God bring
[1:10:42] me to always believe the word always
[1:10:44] believe Christ help me to go to the
[1:10:47] basics and make sure that I know my
[1:10:48] alphabet I know I I know the basic
[1:10:51] things that so that I founded Lord I
[1:10:54] don't even want to be struggling with
[1:10:56] them I want them to become automatic I
[1:10:58] want I want them to be there someone
[1:11:01] says something wrong I just say I
[1:11:02] forgive you Lord. Help me my my my
[1:11:05] foundation to be real Lord. Help my
[1:11:07] revelation to be strong. That's why you
[1:11:10] are building the church. The church has
[1:11:12] to grow but I let my foundation to be
[1:11:14] great.
[1:11:16] Amen.
[1:11:19] Matthew 7 Jesus says therefore whosoever
[1:11:22] heareth these sayings of mine and doeth
[1:11:25] not only hear them but who does not do
[1:11:28] it. I will liken him unto a wise man
[1:11:31] which built his house upon a rock. The
[1:11:34] rain descended, and the flood came, and
[1:11:36] the winds blew, and beat up that house,
[1:11:38] and it fell not, for it was founded upon
[1:11:41] a rock. And everyone that hear these
[1:11:44] sayings of mine, and doeth them not,
[1:11:47] shall be likened unto a foolish man,
[1:11:49] which build his house upon the sand. And
[1:11:51] the rain descended and the flood came
[1:11:53] and the wind blew and beat upon the
[1:11:55] house and it fell and grew and great was
[1:11:58] the fall of it. The height for both
[1:12:02] builders, it's a simple parable that we
[1:12:04] all know. The height of their house that
[1:12:06] they built, maybe the one who built on
[1:12:08] the sand was even higher than the one
[1:12:12] that built on ponder rock. And people
[1:12:14] are looking. Oh wow.
[1:12:19] What a beautiful house.
[1:12:22] My my my
[1:12:24] Oh wow.
[1:12:26] Okay. And the other one is struggling
[1:12:28] with his tiny house there.
[1:12:32] But the problem was not the hide.
[1:12:36] When the wind will come is not even the
[1:12:38] problem is not the height. Both of them
[1:12:40] will go through the same experiences.
[1:12:42] Both of them will go through the same
[1:12:43] pains. The rain will come on both
[1:12:45] houses. The same thing. Sometimes both
[1:12:48] people lose their job. Sometimes both
[1:12:50] people some of them get sick. Sometimes
[1:12:53] the different things happen. Sometime
[1:12:55] they criticize some one mom in the
[1:12:56] church criticize both of them. All the
[1:12:59] the same scenarios, the same things. But
[1:13:02] the one that everybody looking ah one
[1:13:05] was saying so great amen in the church.
[1:13:08] They say oh what happened to that
[1:13:10] person? And to the other one who
[1:13:13] sometimes quiet in the church does not
[1:13:16] say anything but oh Lord I hear what the
[1:13:19] preacher said forgive me Lord help me or
[1:13:22] help me Lord I be desire to become a
[1:13:24] Christian and the other one was oh yeah
[1:13:27] glory to God hallelujah amen the Holy
[1:13:30] Spirit come amen oh third good amen
[1:13:34] few days ago they don't see that person
[1:13:37] anymore he's here oh changing churches
[1:13:40] yeah Hey, what's going on?
[1:13:43] Foundation.
[1:13:46] Foundation was not right.
[1:13:50] Is that correct? Those have been the
[1:13:53] message. They have seen that many times.
[1:13:55] Papa, we have seen that many times. Many
[1:13:58] many times.
[1:14:01] Sometimes stays there for 10 years and
[1:14:04] been 12 years been there. Oh, I've seen
[1:14:08] that. good people
[1:14:12] value them. I cherish them everything
[1:14:15] when a problem comes. Oh,
[1:14:19] I was back on home in Congo. I saw that.
[1:14:21] Oh, I saw I saw my deacon almost
[1:14:23] fighting. Oh, my deacon.
[1:14:28] So Lord, help me Lord. And I had to make
[1:14:30] a decision myself.
[1:14:33] So one church going this one all the the
[1:14:35] the the older pastor and associate
[1:14:38] pastor one go this way while the other
[1:14:40] one one was for the deacon one the
[1:14:41] deacon was for the older pastor hey and
[1:14:45] I'm there young person Lord what's going
[1:14:48] on
[1:14:50] Lord speak to me I realized the message
[1:14:54] was true people I make mistakes but the
[1:14:56] word of God was the truth
[1:14:59] said I will never leave the message
[1:15:01] because this This is a personal
[1:15:03] revelation to me.
[1:15:06] Amen. Amen. Personal revelation to you.
[1:15:19] The prophet says changing a little bit
[1:15:22] the gear a little bit here
[1:15:27] says and the way of expecting the statue
[1:15:29] of perfect man. Paragraph 3:40 said the
[1:15:33] way God is expecting us an individual to
[1:15:36] grow is the way the way he has brought
[1:15:39] his church in to grow. Every church age
[1:15:43] becomes one big church.
[1:15:46] So if he oh God how did how can I grow
[1:15:50] come to the perfect love of God. The
[1:15:53] capstone there says you see how God was
[1:15:56] building his church
[1:15:58] you know Ephesus Mina Pamus Sadis
[1:16:02] Philadelphia
[1:16:04] that's the same way God is building
[1:16:06] individuals
[1:16:08] so if you see and that's what our desire
[1:16:12] when I got this quote just go thank you
[1:16:14] God for confirming what I had in my
[1:16:15] heart because we want to study what the
[1:16:18] God how how how God was building his
[1:16:21] church then we'll understand how God can
[1:16:23] build us. And if we understand how God
[1:16:26] build us, we understand how God builds
[1:16:28] the church because both are related. You
[1:16:31] can't separate them. You'll see the
[1:16:33] fight that the church was going through,
[1:16:35] the fight, the opposition that went
[1:16:37] through, the spirit that was fighting in
[1:16:39] the church, all the different. It's not
[1:16:40] only history is that what we go through,
[1:16:43] the same struggles we go through, the
[1:16:46] same battles we go through, the same
[1:16:48] fight we go through. But God, I don't
[1:16:50] want to stand only at Ephesus. I want to
[1:16:52] go all the way. Amen. To learn this
[1:16:55] year, even to the bright age, Lord. I
[1:16:57] want to grow. I don't want to stop only
[1:16:59] at the at the foundation. I want my
[1:17:01] foundation to be solid, but I want to
[1:17:03] grow all the way to come to the
[1:17:04] capstone, Lord. Amen.
[1:17:08] Amen.
[1:17:11] So, we came out of denominations
[1:17:14] as individuals as it will go in the dark
[1:17:16] ages.
[1:17:18] But let me tell you, denominations did
[1:17:19] not come from our mind. Sometimes
[1:17:22] sometimes denomination stays in our
[1:17:23] mind. Sometimes stays in there still
[1:17:25] have the same tradition from
[1:17:27] denominations. Oh, I came up from the
[1:17:29] the denomination but I'm still have the
[1:17:31] same traditional denominations. I still
[1:17:33] have options of denominations. I still
[1:17:35] have concept of denominations but Lord
[1:17:38] help me to move all the things of
[1:17:40] denominations. I have to move all the
[1:17:42] you know I was a Catholic when I was a
[1:17:44] young person. So the damn emphasis you
[1:17:46] know you have to do and so you are your
[1:17:48] works creates your salvation.
[1:17:51] And sometimes I struggle that with too
[1:17:53] even though being in the message and I
[1:17:54] remember what my mother was there. I
[1:17:56] remember what my father oh oh Lord help
[1:17:58] me Lord help me to get out to understand
[1:18:00] that no I'm a son of God. I can make
[1:18:03] mistakes but Lord I want to go higher
[1:18:05] Lord. You know the desire of my heart.
[1:18:07] You know why I want to stand Lord
[1:18:09] because it is spirit. Amen. Get me out
[1:18:12] of those things. The statue of perfume
[1:18:14] at 3:45 says what I mean see how these
[1:18:16] virtues these building materials type in
[1:18:19] with the church messengers with the
[1:18:21] church edges now one of these days we
[1:18:24] are going to take each one of these
[1:18:26] words and study them out and show that
[1:18:30] it proves it
[1:18:33] I want to study each word of them and
[1:18:35] each messenger and each message and to
[1:18:38] study it and to find out what it is
[1:18:41] because God want to build his church. He
[1:18:43] want to build you as he's building his
[1:18:46] church. How did God build his church?
[1:18:49] How God build his church? No, no, my
[1:18:51] subject is chief cornerstone in the
[1:18:52] foundation. How did God build his
[1:18:54] church? God built his church upon faith,
[1:18:57] upon revelation. Amen. As he told Peter
[1:19:00] in Matthew 16, Jesus answered and said
[1:19:03] unto Peter, "Blessed art thou Simon by
[1:19:06] Joonah,
[1:19:08] for flesh and blood had not revealed
[1:19:10] unto thee, but my father which is in
[1:19:12] heaven, for I have also I I say also
[1:19:16] unto thee, thou art Peter, but upon this
[1:19:19] rock I will build my church." God will
[1:19:22] build his church upon the revelation.
[1:19:24] God will build his church upon faith.
[1:19:27] Amen. We outside of faith, God cannot
[1:19:30] build the church. So God had to build
[1:19:32] the church upon revelation of who Jesus
[1:19:35] Christ is. And you if you want to grow
[1:19:38] up in God, if you want to start a
[1:19:40] relationship with God, if you want to be
[1:19:42] a building of God, you have to start by
[1:19:44] a personal revelation to you of who
[1:19:47] Jesus Christ is, who the word of God is.
[1:19:51] Amen. What importance, how important is
[1:19:54] the word of God to you? Amen. How
[1:19:57] important is how in which scale on which
[1:19:59] scale can you put the word of God? Where
[1:20:02] you put the word of God that's where you
[1:20:04] are going to stop. You can never go
[1:20:06] beyond the value of what you put the
[1:20:08] word of God in your life.
[1:20:13] If you cherish that's where you'll go.
[1:20:15] Amen. Amen.
[1:20:19] Sorry for sometime to take to stir you a
[1:20:21] little bit this evening but I want that
[1:20:22] to become a reality Lord. Amen. Amen.
[1:20:27] Because upon this rock I will build my
[1:20:29] church and the gates of hell shall not
[1:20:30] prevail against it. The enemy will fight
[1:20:34] against your revelation. The enemy will
[1:20:36] be always against that revelation. But
[1:20:38] God has given a promise that if you have
[1:20:41] that revelation, the gates of hell can
[1:20:44] never prevail against that revelation.
[1:20:47] Amen. Amen. Even said to Peter, I will
[1:20:49] give you that unto thee the keys of the
[1:20:52] kingdom, and whatsoever shall bind on
[1:20:54] earth shall be bound in heaven, and
[1:20:57] whatsoever that shall loose on earth
[1:20:58] shall be loosed in heaven. The same
[1:21:00] authority is given to the believer
[1:21:02] today. Amen. But it has to start by
[1:21:05] revelation. We touch you on Wednesday.
[1:21:07] You can never overemphasize the
[1:21:09] importance of revelation to a believer.
[1:21:12] Amen. To the unbeliever, there is not
[1:21:15] even a place to start. to the believer,
[1:21:17] the one who believes, continue to
[1:21:19] express to him that your revelation is
[1:21:21] your victory. Your faith is your
[1:21:23] victory. That what will give you
[1:21:24] authority over the devil. It's your
[1:21:26] revelation is your faith. You keep
[1:21:28] testifying, God, you have saved me. God,
[1:21:31] you will you will clean me. God, you
[1:21:33] will walk with me. God, you will bring
[1:21:35] me to a higher position. Keep believing
[1:21:38] in the word of God. How you study as
[1:21:40] revelation, that's what will be that how
[1:21:42] you can grow in with God. Amen. Paul
[1:21:45] said in 1 Corinthians 3 10:11,
[1:21:48] "According to the grace of God, which is
[1:21:50] given unto me as a wise master builder,
[1:21:52] I have laid the foundation another build
[1:21:55] of their own. But let every man take
[1:21:57] heed how he builds there upon. For other
[1:22:01] foundation can no man lay than that is
[1:22:03] laid, which is Jesus Christ." Amen. The
[1:22:07] only foundation is Jesus Christ. He laid
[1:22:10] the foundation. Paul laid the
[1:22:11] foundation. He says now whoever comes
[1:22:14] and build upon that foundation he has to
[1:22:16] make sure how he's building upon that
[1:22:18] foundation. Don't remove the foundation.
[1:22:20] Don't take away the foundation because
[1:22:22] Paul himself could not deny the
[1:22:24] foundation he has built. He said if even
[1:22:26] me or any other person even an angel
[1:22:29] comes from from heaven and comes and try
[1:22:32] to deny what I've put as foundation let
[1:22:35] him be a cursed let him be an attempt
[1:22:36] let me be let him be cursed because I
[1:22:39] cannot change what God has given me by
[1:22:41] revelation no one can change what God
[1:22:44] has given the church by revelation no
[1:22:46] one should come and change and say Paul
[1:22:49] saying or Paul's scriptures was only a
[1:22:51] mind of a man or is he a counselor that
[1:22:54] was for his time home. Uh it was
[1:22:56] revelation of God. Amen. No one can
[1:22:58] change it. Amen. That's right. Aren't
[1:23:01] you thankful that the William Brham came
[1:23:03] and brought us back to what Paul had
[1:23:05] preached. Amen. Because say I've
[1:23:07] preached exactly as Paul has preached
[1:23:10] and the saints over there says, "Oh,
[1:23:12] that's where we are relying on because
[1:23:15] you preach like Paul preached and if a
[1:23:17] Christian is time of Paul made it, we
[1:23:19] will make it as well because we didn't
[1:23:22] come away from the word of God. We take
[1:23:24] the whole word of God. Paul preached the
[1:23:26] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ. We
[1:23:28] believe in the baptism in the name of
[1:23:30] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[1:23:38] Paul and and Peter preached again the
[1:23:40] woman women preachers. We preach against
[1:23:43] the woman preachers. A man is not being
[1:23:45] against woman. It's just the word of
[1:23:47] God. How? Oh, but she's so gifted. Oh,
[1:23:51] and what?
[1:23:55] Amen. Paul preached against women
[1:23:57] cutting the hair. We preached against
[1:23:59] it. Paul preached for men to love their
[1:24:01] wives. We love our wives. We have to
[1:24:04] preach it to love our wife, to cherish
[1:24:07] them, to to make them feel to enable
[1:24:11] them to become like Esther.
[1:24:14] You know Esther, we talk too much about
[1:24:15] Esther, but the king had to enable her.
[1:24:18] So, I have to enable you. to the poor my
[1:24:21] position. Amen. Husband sometimes we
[1:24:24] don't enable our wives to come to the
[1:24:27] position. We just want to be the one
[1:24:29] having authority or have no know you are
[1:24:31] there. You are you are second class and
[1:24:34] different things. That's not the
[1:24:35] message. You come to bring her to come
[1:24:38] to her position. She will make decisions
[1:24:42] and she consult you. But you respect
[1:24:44] her. You love her. Amen. Families value
[1:24:47] masterpiece families. That's what the
[1:24:49] message comes to bring us and that's
[1:24:50] what I cherish you know as you know me I
[1:24:54] cherish oh lord help me to make me a
[1:24:57] good husband
[1:25:00] you know make me a good husband
[1:25:03] that you know what my wife can look and
[1:25:06] say you know what God you gave me a good
[1:25:09] husband
[1:25:12] that's my desire you know she's like
[1:25:14] like herself look out
[1:25:18] Sometimes he's stubborn and different,
[1:25:20] but he's a good man. That that's my
[1:25:23] desire. I'm honest with you. Lord, help
[1:25:26] me. I have mistakes and help me to
[1:25:28] become that that good husband. She can
[1:25:31] say, "Lord, thank you for that good
[1:25:33] husband, but I need to enable her."
[1:25:37] Paul preached against
[1:25:39] women authority of of husbands.
[1:25:43] So there are two balances. Respect your
[1:25:45] husband. We preach the same thing. Amen.
[1:25:52] Is it okay?
[1:25:55] He preached the resurrection. He
[1:25:57] preached the rapture. That's why we
[1:25:59] preach. He didn't obtain to it, but he
[1:26:02] preached it hoping that he will get to
[1:26:04] there. But now it's our time to preach
[1:26:06] it. Maybe to emphasize more on it
[1:26:09] because right we are right there. We are
[1:26:11] right at the door of the rapture. We are
[1:26:12] right at the door of the resurrection.
[1:26:14] It's our time. It's our promise. So we
[1:26:16] emphasiz on it. But Paul preached it
[1:26:18] already there. They without us, they
[1:26:21] without us cannot come to that
[1:26:23] perfection cannot come to that rapture.
[1:26:25] But he still mentioned it. Still
[1:26:26] preached it. Amen. That's why we can
[1:26:28] return to it. Oh, I preached like Paul
[1:26:30] preached. Amen. But I have a great
[1:26:32] revelation. Even Paul didn't even know.
[1:26:35] And others they didn't know that were
[1:26:37] they were part the messenger of the
[1:26:38] Ephesus.
[1:26:41] Arenas didn't know that he was the
[1:26:42] messenger of Simeina. That's right. and
[1:26:44] the other one they didn't know that a
[1:26:45] messenger of that time only one knew
[1:26:48] that he was a messenger of his own age
[1:26:50] and he's telling the bride I'm the me he
[1:26:52] didn't maybe express it over I don't see
[1:26:55] in French but openly I'm the messenger
[1:26:57] of Leodia but as he's giving the type as
[1:27:00] he's giving the scriptures the bride
[1:27:02] identifies as oh that's the messenger
[1:27:04] that's my messenger God has given me a
[1:27:06] messenger and as you receive a prophet
[1:27:08] and the quality of a prophet you will
[1:27:10] have the benefit and the reward of a
[1:27:12] prophet Amen.
[1:27:16] Now in that foundation of faith as we
[1:27:19] have talked a bit in the foundation of
[1:27:20] faith
[1:27:22] you must find the corn the chief
[1:27:24] cornerstone
[1:27:26] Christ.
[1:27:28] Ephesians 2:19 says, "Now therefore, you
[1:27:31] are no more strangers and foreigners,
[1:27:33] but fellow citizens with the saints and
[1:27:36] of the household of God, and are built
[1:27:38] upon the foundation of the apostles and
[1:27:41] prophet, Jesus Christ himself being the
[1:27:44] chief cornerstone." So we have been
[1:27:47] founded on the foundation of apostles
[1:27:49] and prophet. That's why we preach.
[1:27:51] That's why we love the mercy. We love
[1:27:53] the word of God. We preach upon that
[1:27:55] foundation. We can't get away from that
[1:27:57] foundation. In whom all the building
[1:28:00] fitly framed together groweth unto a
[1:28:02] holy temple in the Lord. In whom he also
[1:28:05] build it together for inhabitation of
[1:28:07] God through the spirit. Amen.
[1:28:10] We need to find in that foundation here
[1:28:13] faith. We need to put a cornerstone. I
[1:28:17] will give it maybe here this
[1:28:19] cornerstone.
[1:28:21] We need need make sure that you have
[1:28:23] that cornerstone
[1:28:26] because you can have the whole faith.
[1:28:28] You can have the whole faith even moving
[1:28:31] mountains even making me having great
[1:28:33] faith to to operate miracles which will
[1:28:36] get great things but without that chief
[1:28:40] cornerstone you have missed the point.
[1:28:49] Search of the perfect man 139. But so
[1:28:51] many of us try to do the works of Christ
[1:28:54] before the reflection of Christ is in
[1:28:56] us. Now that there is the trouble. We
[1:29:00] find those things happening. You know it
[1:29:02] and I know it. We see these stumbles
[1:29:05] along the road. We find this this crap
[1:29:08] heap of ministers of Christians piled
[1:29:12] along the road is because they didn't go
[1:29:15] into it right. That's right. They didn't
[1:29:18] go it the right way. Maybe they studied
[1:29:21] well. Maybe they were very zealous.
[1:29:23] Maybe they did different things. But
[1:29:25] they didn't put the chief cornerstone.
[1:29:28] Amen. They rejected that cornerstone.
[1:29:30] Oh, no. No. That is for the old time a
[1:29:32] little bit like in the time of Solomon.
[1:29:34] So no, we are building this, we are
[1:29:36] building this house, but we don't want
[1:29:38] to take the cornerstone. We don't want
[1:29:40] to take the chief cornerstone. Maybe
[1:29:41] I'll be closing that. It's a small
[1:29:43] thought this morning, but just want you
[1:29:45] to think about it. Lord, help me that my
[1:29:47] foundation is solid.
[1:29:50] Help me that I have the real revelation.
[1:29:53] But also on top of that, Lord, I want to
[1:29:56] make sure that the cornerstone is there.
[1:30:00] Be reading me long reading here. Bear
[1:30:03] with me. Now notice in the dedication in
[1:30:06] the building down there, the next
[1:30:08] chapter that in this building there was
[1:30:09] one stone that was actually too old to
[1:30:12] look to fool with. So the builders
[1:30:14] rejected it. They just pitched it over
[1:30:17] into the corner and say that stone is
[1:30:19] actually too old to be used. There's no
[1:30:22] such a place. Remember it was the
[1:30:24] builders who should have known
[1:30:26] different. Jesus spoke of it. But come
[1:30:28] to find out they had built a building so
[1:30:31] high but they missed that stone and they
[1:30:34] didn't know where that stone was. They
[1:30:36] might have searched all the ship. They
[1:30:38] might have run through every oxcart.
[1:30:40] They might have sent messenger up into
[1:30:42] Jopa and down and says there's another
[1:30:44] lord coming. Did you lose one of the
[1:30:46] road? There's something wrong. We just
[1:30:47] can't find that stone for this place.
[1:30:50] And and when they could not find it
[1:30:52] nowhere else come to find out it was
[1:30:55] right on the ground. It was the chief
[1:30:58] cornerstone that the builder rejected.
[1:31:02] Jesus spoke of it and said, "Have not
[1:31:04] read of the stone that the builders
[1:31:06] rejected was the chief cornerstone, the
[1:31:08] head of it all where the rest of the
[1:31:10] building rested upon it. And I think in
[1:31:12] the building today of the spiritual
[1:31:15] house that God worships in, and he's
[1:31:17] talking now to you and me says, I think
[1:31:19] that's been a great big failure today
[1:31:22] among the builders. We have come with
[1:31:24] our denominations. We have led them in
[1:31:27] sincerity. We have sent our boys to
[1:31:29] school, educate them to speak well
[1:31:31] before a congregation, learned them
[1:31:34] psychology and Bible history. And we
[1:31:36] have did everything and build fine pews
[1:31:38] and made high towering stables and
[1:31:41] beautiful music and so forth. Have we
[1:31:44] built but we find out there is something
[1:31:46] wrong. We have tried to build out our
[1:31:50] man-made material. What education could
[1:31:52] produce? What seminaries could bring out
[1:31:55] of them? What scholarship we try to
[1:31:57] build that upon education, upon
[1:31:59] scholarship, upon denomination, but all
[1:32:02] these things will not work as long as we
[1:32:04] have not accepted this old stone, this
[1:32:07] peculiar stone.
[1:32:10] So what is that stone? They built all
[1:32:13] the way then but they can't they can't
[1:32:15] realize what that stone is. They come
[1:32:17] here to the cap here. But where is that
[1:32:19] stone? We have built everything. They've
[1:32:22] built everything. They come here, they
[1:32:24] can't get that. because they're stuck
[1:32:26] here.
[1:32:28] This one cannot come unless this the
[1:32:31] whole thing is complete. But I'm missing
[1:32:33] this one.
[1:32:35] But before this all this one comes, this
[1:32:38] one has to be completed because this one
[1:32:41] in a real triangle, this one is the same
[1:32:44] size as this one. This one is actually
[1:32:47] the same as this one. If you miss this
[1:32:50] one, you'll miss that one, too. Because
[1:32:52] the same thing. It's the same size. is
[1:32:54] the same everything.
[1:33:03] But as the building begin to
[1:33:04] materialize, they realize that the hole
[1:33:06] that was left, that old stone fit in to
[1:33:09] the dot,
[1:33:11] that's where the the spiritual builders
[1:33:13] today.
[1:33:15] That's why the bride building of Christ
[1:33:17] is not ready for the bridegroom.
[1:33:20] is because that the builders have
[1:33:22] rejected the chief cornerstone that was
[1:33:25] laid on the day of Pentecost which is
[1:33:27] the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[1:33:31] That chief cornerstone was the baptism
[1:33:33] of the Holy Spirit. That chief
[1:33:35] cornerstone is a new birth. Amen. That
[1:33:38] people have put aside.
[1:33:41] Oh, I just want to be a religious. Oh, I
[1:33:43] come to church, you know, I just put a
[1:33:45] long shirt and I become a message
[1:33:47] believer and that's enough for me. I
[1:33:50] don't read the Bible. I don't pray at
[1:33:52] home. I don't do all these things and
[1:33:54] I'm just in the pew and I don't I'm just
[1:33:56] a message believer. No,
[1:34:00] the Holy Spirit feeds upon the word of
[1:34:02] God.
[1:34:04] Lord, make me have that cornerstone that
[1:34:07] feeds upon the word of God. The new
[1:34:09] birth, the reality of the Holy Spirit
[1:34:12] for me, for my children, Lord, for my
[1:34:14] family. I want each one to have the
[1:34:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost. myself. Lord,
[1:34:19] fill me with more of you. Fill me with
[1:34:21] the Holy Spirit, more of you. One
[1:34:23] baptism, but many refilling. Amen.
[1:34:32] Is that correct? This man, it's too old.
[1:34:35] People have act funny. They don't come
[1:34:38] in the order of of psychology, of
[1:34:40] education, our learning, our creeds. It
[1:34:42] don't fit in there. and they kicked it
[1:34:43] off because it was too old, too
[1:34:45] peculiar, too disagreeable with the
[1:34:47] plans that we as a man had ideas of what
[1:34:49] the church ought to be. We have become
[1:34:52] polished scholars. It ought to be a
[1:34:54] group of fine dressed people. It ought
[1:34:56] to be a group of we have tried to make
[1:34:58] it an educational program, something
[1:35:00] that will please our five senses,
[1:35:02] something that you could see and taste
[1:35:04] and feel or something. Most of it has
[1:35:06] been through the site. I mean, look at
[1:35:08] our fine people. Look at our best crowd
[1:35:10] in the city. The mayor comes to our
[1:35:12] place. Oh, look at this. The chief
[1:35:14] executive of the chief of police come to
[1:35:16] our church and we find out when
[1:35:20] the building did not go on. They
[1:35:21] rejected away the stone that God has so
[1:35:24] prepared for it. And sometimes the
[1:35:26] message sometimes we make that mistakes.
[1:35:28] Oh, I want those big things and things.
[1:35:30] But Lord, I don't want to miss if if
[1:35:33] there is anything that can I look I I
[1:35:35] want the church to come to is to be
[1:35:37] filled with the Holy Ghost. Lord, fill
[1:35:39] us with the Holy Ghost. the real Holy
[1:35:41] Ghost and not only Holy Ghost in the
[1:35:43] mind, not Holy Ghost in the flesh, not
[1:35:45] Holy Ghost in in the spirit, but the
[1:35:48] Holy Ghost in the soul, the reality, the
[1:35:51] the personal revelation of God. Faith is
[1:35:54] important that we need faith, but we
[1:35:56] need faith to come to maturity where it
[1:35:59] can come and produce the real faith of
[1:36:02] God, the the real baptism of the Holy
[1:36:04] Spirit. Amen.
[1:36:14] the same line
[1:36:22] there
[1:36:24] that the old times now is going through
[1:36:27] the so the prophet says now I want to
[1:36:30] say this that there are some people who
[1:36:32] have a portion of this virtue portion of
[1:36:35] knowledge wisdom and patience Christians
[1:36:37] and so forth. They don't even profess to
[1:36:39] be Christians. And we are teaching
[1:36:42] Sunday school. There is some people have
[1:36:44] a portion of these and don't even
[1:36:46] pretend to be Christians. Some people
[1:36:48] can have all these virtues. They are not
[1:36:50] even Christians. Oh, this is a good
[1:36:52] person. This is God. He's very kind. He
[1:36:54] was very patient. Oh, all the different
[1:36:56] things. Oh, oh, that's the trade of
[1:36:58] their family. They're always very good
[1:37:00] people. And you can be mistaken. You
[1:37:02] think that you have the Holy Ghost. No,
[1:37:04] it's just your nature. It's just the way
[1:37:06] you are and everything. But let me tell
[1:37:08] you, maybe it sounds weird, but just
[1:37:11] natural thread of being nice person will
[1:37:13] don't help you to go to heaven. It's not
[1:37:16] enough. You need a new birth. Even if
[1:37:19] it's natural, it still need to be
[1:37:21] changed. It needs to be transformed. It
[1:37:23] needs to be equipped by the Holy Ghost.
[1:37:25] Amen. You can't produce anything on your
[1:37:27] own. It will be just manufacturing. So
[1:37:29] he goes, say that won't do it. That
[1:37:32] don't even pretend to be it. That won't
[1:37:34] do it. It's like a black bird trying to
[1:37:36] put peacock feathers on his wings to
[1:37:39] make him a peacock. He only disgraces
[1:37:41] himself. Better be better to stay a
[1:37:44] black bird. When he tried to exercise
[1:37:47] these things without being a Christian
[1:37:49] is simply all out of place. Amen. It's
[1:37:52] like a sycamore tree trying to
[1:37:54] manufacture apples. It couldn't do it.
[1:37:56] Or although it's a tree, but it can't
[1:37:58] manufacture apples. It's like a mule
[1:38:00] trying to manufacture wool.
[1:38:04] Wool. I always get confused there. Wool.
[1:38:08] My wife always say wool. Okay. Wool.
[1:38:13] I'm a French speaker. So, excuse me. So,
[1:38:17] manufacture wool. Trying to be a sheep
[1:38:20] when he's a mule. He can't manufacture
[1:38:22] wool. He don't do it. He can't do it.
[1:38:25] Wool is a gift to a sheep, not a mule.
[1:38:28] He might try to act like a sheep, but
[1:38:30] he's still a mule. Say say, "Well, I
[1:38:33] can't eat. I can eat like a sheep. I can
[1:38:35] do this like a sheep." No matter what
[1:38:37] you can do, you've got to be a sheep in
[1:38:39] order to have war.
[1:38:42] For those who have natural things, it's
[1:38:44] good, but still need to be changed.
[1:38:46] There needs to be need to be
[1:38:47] transformed. Needs to be attached from
[1:38:49] God. Amen. There needs to be something
[1:38:51] real that has to become. For those who
[1:38:53] don't have them, don't try to
[1:38:55] manufacture them. Don't try to say it
[1:38:58] seems by the Moses preach upon virtue I
[1:39:01] want to be so virtuous now from now on I
[1:39:04] have virtue knowledge or temperance no
[1:39:06] now I will try to be as temperant as I
[1:39:09] can that won't work what you need to say
[1:39:12] Lord fill me with the Holy Ghost that
[1:39:15] will produce that temperance that will
[1:39:17] produce the patience that produce the
[1:39:19] godliness fill me with yourself that the
[1:39:21] life becomes so real in my life that I
[1:39:24] don't have to force anything that
[1:39:26] becomes natural in me, Lord. Amen. So
[1:39:29] become so desperate for more of God.
[1:39:31] Lord, I desire your life. I desire the
[1:39:34] power of God. As we go through all of
[1:39:36] them, Lord, I desire the virtue of God.
[1:39:39] I desire the Holy Spirit to come and
[1:39:41] produce the virtue in my life. Why am I
[1:39:44] still stumbling here, stumbling here?
[1:39:46] Lord, I desire the life of Jesus Christ.
[1:39:48] Give me that thirst and hungry for God.
[1:39:51] Lord, make me more on fire for you,
[1:39:54] Lord. Oh yeah. Let me grow, Lord. Give
[1:39:57] me the Holy Spirit. Father,
[1:40:00] the more you ask for it, the more God
[1:40:02] gives you. The more you believe that God
[1:40:04] will give you, God will give you. You
[1:40:07] cannot you can grow as as as far as your
[1:40:10] faith goes. Amen. Prophet says one quot
[1:40:13] you can go as far as your faith goes.
[1:40:15] God, I ask it. I believe it. Now I give
[1:40:18] it to me, Lord. And God will give it to
[1:40:20] you. Amen.
[1:40:22] A sheep doesn't manufacture wool. He has
[1:40:24] wool because he's a sheep. I like that
[1:40:26] expression. He has wool because he's a
[1:40:28] sheep.
[1:40:30] A lot of people trying to say, well,
[1:40:32] I'll try to get good. I'll try to do
[1:40:34] this. Don't manufacture nothing. Oh, no.
[1:40:38] You can't do it. A sheep doesn't isn't
[1:40:40] ask isn't expected to manufacture wool.
[1:40:42] He bears wool and he does it because
[1:40:45] he's a sheep. Amen. God let me die to my
[1:40:48] old nature and come to life life of
[1:40:53] Jesus Christ. Then I will produce it.
[1:40:55] Lord, it will be manifested
[1:40:57] automatically. Lord, help me to die.
[1:41:00] Help me to die. Sometimes I hang to my
[1:41:02] old life. I don't want to die to my old
[1:41:04] life. It was so precious. My pride is my
[1:41:07] different things. But Lord, help me to
[1:41:09] die to those old things that can produce
[1:41:11] the life of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:41:21] A vulture trying to put to eat with the
[1:41:23] dove. A vulture trying a vulture trying
[1:41:25] to be a dove. Could you imagine a bazard
[1:41:28] out there? 92. I'm you know I'm a dove.
[1:41:31] I'm I've put a few feathers in in in him
[1:41:34] say look it just be all out of shape.
[1:41:37] There's a man who professing to be
[1:41:39] something when he's not. See you can't
[1:41:41] do it. So no, I'm I'm message believer
[1:41:44] and everything. Young people are message
[1:41:47] believer. I sing specials and
[1:41:49] everything. But during the evening,
[1:41:52] during the night, you on the internet
[1:41:54] and checking things and dirty things and
[1:41:57] different things and the following day
[1:41:58] you come, oh messenger believer, message
[1:42:00] believer. That's not good.
[1:42:05] Amen. Lord, give me the new birth to
[1:42:08] take the desire of those things.
[1:42:12] If you're struggling or talk to someone
[1:42:14] who you trust, you pray about it and you
[1:42:17] know committed to God, you pray and amen
[1:42:20] because you're just killing yourself.
[1:42:27] Now you can't say now look I'm supposed
[1:42:29] to have virtue. I'll have virtue. I'm
[1:42:32] supposed to have godliness now have why
[1:42:34] you are only trying to place feathers
[1:42:36] though you are in your though they are
[1:42:39] in your reach. So they are available but
[1:42:41] you try trying to put the you can't put
[1:42:43] the feathers in the wrong bird. No he
[1:42:46] has it won't work. It only shows what a
[1:42:49] hypocrite that bird is. Could you
[1:42:51] imagine an old bazard trying to have
[1:42:53] couple of dove feathers? Look here I'm a
[1:42:56] dove. Well we all know it's a bazard.
[1:42:58] It's old but you can tell that is a
[1:43:00] bazard. In other words it say not say
[1:43:03] you you need to be born again because
[1:43:06] the old nature here is a bazard. This is
[1:43:08] a bazard. But you need to be born again
[1:43:11] to have the nature of a dove and grow as
[1:43:13] a dove and express as a dove. Amen. See
[1:43:16] now what way it is trying to manufacture
[1:43:18] Christianity. The first thing you've got
[1:43:20] to do is be born again. You have got to
[1:43:24] be changed. When you are changed, you
[1:43:26] become a new creation. You're getting
[1:43:28] rights now. See, if you don't have now,
[1:43:31] now you don't have to worry about the
[1:43:33] feathers. It will take care of itself
[1:43:36] when you are born again. Yes sir. So
[1:43:39] what you have to do when you are born
[1:43:41] again if you have a sheep it will
[1:43:43] produce wool. If if you have if you have
[1:43:45] a dove it will produce the right kind of
[1:43:47] feathers. It the oil will come from the
[1:43:49] inside and cleaning those feathers. What
[1:43:52] you need to do is to feed upon the word
[1:43:54] of God. If you don't if the sheep does
[1:43:56] if it doesn't feed upon what the the
[1:43:58] right the right food it won't produce
[1:44:01] the right kind quantity of wool and the
[1:44:03] right quality of wool. So need to feed
[1:44:05] upon the word of God. That's why we we
[1:44:08] come to church. Amen. That's why we come
[1:44:10] to church. That's why we listen to the
[1:44:12] tapes. That's why we read the Bible.
[1:44:14] That's why that's why you stay in prayer
[1:44:16] so that the nature of God can be
[1:44:18] expressed. If you don't have the new
[1:44:21] birth, pray God, fill me with the Holy
[1:44:23] Ghost. The new birth is the baptism of
[1:44:25] the Holy Ghost. And but if if you have
[1:44:27] it, let me tell let me encourage you,
[1:44:29] feed more upon the word of God. Stay
[1:44:31] more in the atmosphere so that it can be
[1:44:34] expressed. Amen. Amen.
[1:44:42] I think it's good we can stop there. We
[1:44:44] will upon faith next time. Amen. I think
[1:44:48] it's it's good enough. says, "You know,
[1:44:52] musicians can come." You say, "Well,
[1:44:55] brother Bam, I know this certain woman
[1:44:57] over there. Why she never did do
[1:44:59] anything wrong? She's a good woman. This
[1:45:01] such and such a man is a good man. He
[1:45:03] never does anything." You know, he
[1:45:06] doesn't harm anybody. That doesn't mean
[1:45:08] one thing. He might make a good
[1:45:11] neighbor, but he isn't a Christian until
[1:45:14] he's born again. Amen.
[1:45:18] You're not even converted yet until you
[1:45:21] are born again. Until you receive the
[1:45:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost. The new birth
[1:45:27] is not an option. The new birth is a
[1:45:31] reality. The new birth is a master. Is a
[1:45:34] master. You can't make it without the
[1:45:36] new birth. Is a master. Amen. But now,
[1:45:40] how do I know that I have the
[1:45:42] cornerstone?
[1:45:43] I don't want to leave you hanging. How
[1:45:46] do I know that I have that cornerstone?
[1:45:49] Is God revealed to you that you know
[1:45:51] that you know that you know God?
[1:45:54] I can never forsake you. No matter what
[1:45:57] my father does, no matter what my one
[1:46:00] one young preacher said,
[1:46:04] I like it. He was a young preacher. He
[1:46:06] got converted and then he became a
[1:46:09] preacher and he says, "You know what? I
[1:46:10] came to realize
[1:46:13] even if my father backslid
[1:46:16] that's one place I can disobey my father
[1:46:21] because it became so real to him says oh
[1:46:25] this I cannot go away from the message
[1:46:27] it's so real to me that even if my
[1:46:30] father forces me I can never deny it so
[1:46:35] that's the cornerstone
[1:46:38] it's a personal revelation to
[1:46:41] And how do I know that I have that that
[1:46:43] cornerstone?
[1:46:44] Look at your desires.
[1:46:46] If you still love the things of the past
[1:46:50] or maybe it's not there yet. Lord, take
[1:46:53] away those old desires and give me the
[1:46:56] desire of Christ.
[1:46:58] Does it mean that you are perfect? You
[1:47:00] don't make mistakes or you don't
[1:47:01] stumble. No. But you have one testimony
[1:47:04] when you can say, you know, I'm not what
[1:47:07] I ought to be. I'm not even what I want
[1:47:10] to be. But one thing, I'm not what I
[1:47:14] used to be. Something has changed in my
[1:47:17] life. Lord, bring us closer to you. Is
[1:47:20] that the desire of your heart this
[1:47:22] morning? God bless you.
[1:47:27] Let's stand together.
[1:47:33] [Music]
[1:47:45] More of you.
[1:47:52] All of you.
[1:47:58] I've had it all.
[1:48:02] All I need is more for you.
[1:48:11] Of things I've had my faith,
[1:48:18] but yet
[1:48:20] I hunger
[1:48:22] still.
