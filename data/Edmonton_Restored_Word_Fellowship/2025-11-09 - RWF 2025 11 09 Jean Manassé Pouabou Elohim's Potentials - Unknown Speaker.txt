Summary of the Sermon “Elohim’s Potentials”

In this sermon, Brother Jean-Manassé Pouabou begins by reading from Genesis 3:6–24, showing the tragic moment when Adam and Eve were driven from Eden because of disobedience. He reminds the congregation that this was one of the saddest scenes in Scripture, not because God desired to punish, but because it broke God’s heart to send His own children away. Yet even in judgment, God gave a promise—“I will put enmity…”—showing that He already had a plan to bring His children back (Gen. 3:15). The preacher emphasizes that this reveals God’s true nature: not distant or angry, but a loving Father whose motive has always been restoration. This theme is supported by David’s revelation that God’s presence follows His own everywhere (Ps. 139), a truth the sermon highlights to comfort believers who may feel far from God.

Brother Jean-Manassé then draws from Galatians 3:13–14 to show how Christ became a curse to reverse the curse of Eden and restore the blessing of Abraham to the Gentiles. He shows that redemption was not an afterthought; it was part of God’s eternal plan to express His own attributes. Here he brings in teachings from Brother Branham—especially from *Christ the Mystery of God Revealed*, *Who Is This Melchisedec*, and *Choosing of the Bride*. He explains that in the beginning, God was Elohim, full of attributes and potentials not yet expressed. According to Branham, God was “potentially God” until angels worshiped Him, which activated the attribute of Godship. Likewise, God expressed His attributes further through Adam and Eve, not only as Creator but also as Father.

The preacher also explains that just as God had dormant attributes, Adam also had potentials that could only be expressed through his bride. This becomes a parallel to Christ and His Bride in the last days: the Bride is the vessel through whom God now reveals His fullest attributes. Brother Jean stresses...

Why &gt;&gt; don't you lift up your hand as we go to him in prayer? Heavenly Father, Lord, with this confession upon our lips, we want to say more than words, Lord, more than a song. It's a reality in our souls. &gt;&gt; Lord, we believe. &gt;&gt; We believe your word, Lord. We believe every promise in this book is ours. We believe that when you say something, it will come to pass. We believe that even though it may take a week, a month, a year, or 10 years, it does not matter. It will happen. We believe your word for we are believers. Believers always believe no matter what. No matter what the opposition is, no matter what the circumstances are, we believe in your word. &gt;&gt; So we invite you this morning, Holy Spirit, as we sense your nearness already. We say, "Have your way this morning, Father. Your will be done. Speak to our hearts your word, Father. And Lord, may you be pleased, oh God. Because without faith, it's impossible to please God. But I pray, Father, that this morning, you will impart revelation to our hearts. That when we leave this place, Lord, we will know you in a better way, Lord. In a greater way, Father, and each one of us can say at the end of the service, I love him more &gt;&gt; than when I first came to church. &gt;&gt; We commit the reading of the word, the preaching of the word, the hearing of the word into your hands in the name of Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the church says, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. I'm brother Jean, not brother Risa, brother Jean. I am from Bible way as you know. Um, happy to be here. This is my first time in this church. I've been in Edmonton before, but this is my first time here. So, thank you, brother Moyes, for the invitation. Uh, Brother Zeke. I just pleased to be here. &gt;&gt; I trust something we'll be say this morning that will that will be a blessing to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; If I can preach as as good as brother Ray sang, &gt;&gt; then I know we're going to have church. &gt;&gt; So you help him. You help him sing. So help me preach. And &gt;&gt; if 10 minutes in the service, uh, I might call him back. So brother V, just come and sing. &gt;&gt; But you love the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can sing. But the word is the most important thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So we will turn into the Bible. We will go in the book of Genesis chapter 3. That's where I'm going to start. We will also read in Galatians 3 after that. But let's start with Genesis 3 verse 6-9. &gt;&gt; Are you there? Amen. &gt;&gt; And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and the tree to be desired to make one wise, she took the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat. And the eyes of them both were open, and they knew they were naked. If people were sincere, when they read the Bible, they'll understand that this is not a fruit, right? How do you eat a fruit and realize you're naked? I mean, it shouldn't even require revelation, but it does require revelation. &gt;&gt; And he said, "And they s fig leaves together and made themselves aprons. And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden of Eden in the cool of the day. And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, where art thou?" Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh let's also just jump to 23. Verse 23. Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken. So he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubams and the flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life. I'm so glad this is not all there is to the Bible &gt;&gt; because if this is where the Bible ended, you and I will be in trouble. But there's 65 books after where God now shows us the plan that he devised to reverse this picture we just read. &gt;&gt; So that where once man was driven out of Eden, now he's driven to Eden. &gt;&gt; All right, let's go now in book of Galatians chapter 3 verse 13 to 14. Galatians 3 13-4. Christ have redeemed us from the curse of the law being made curse for us. &gt;&gt; Strange, right? He has redeemed us from the curse. But the way he did that, he himself had to be made a curse. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it says cursed is everyone that hangeth from the tree that the blessing of Abraham might come unto the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith. So the only way the blessings of Abraham will come to the Gentiles was for Christ to become a curse. So out of a curse came a blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. All &gt;&gt; right. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we pray now, Lord, that you'll take your word, Father. The prophet has told us multiple times, any man who knows how to read can read this Bible. &gt;&gt; But it takes the Holy Spirit, Lord, to make it come alive. Lord, if God doesn't take the words that we just read and quickens it to our heart, this is in vain. This meaning will be in vain. All these words will be said in vain. But when he comes and he takes a word, sometimes not even an entire sentence, sometimes just one word from God is enough &gt;&gt; to change our lives. Lord, &gt;&gt; come by our way now this morning in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Man, you may be seated or you can stand the whole service if you want to. I'll be standing. Can I make myself comfortable? &gt;&gt; Can I Can I Can I feel at home? &gt;&gt; All right. If I don't come back, then you know what happened. &gt;&gt; I bring you greetings from our church. Clo the Bible way on the sensor wanted me to pass my greetings here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. We can enjoy ourselves this morning. &gt;&gt; I love what brother Moses says. We also have a right to have a good time. You know, church is not always just solemn. It's like we're not Catholics. We don't come here wearing robes and we're like so dignified. &gt;&gt; God is our father. &gt;&gt; This is his house. &gt;&gt; So, this is home. &gt;&gt; We are at home. We should be able to enjoy ourselves &gt;&gt; because we're living in the most glorious time that there is in the story of redemption. &gt;&gt; This is more glorious than the days of Paul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is more glorious than the days of Jesus Christ in the flesh. You're like, "Whoa, is it?" Yes, it is. Because Christ died on Calvary for you. &gt;&gt; So that in this last days, the title did that was lost in Eden, &gt;&gt; what Adam lost could be restored back to man. &gt;&gt; What we just read here in Genesis 3, Berlin describes this as one of the saddest scenes in the entire Bible. &gt;&gt; Where God is now kicking out of Eden his own family. &gt;&gt; Think about that. Think about being a father and because of something that your children did and you drive all of them out. &gt;&gt; That's what essentially God did. Says we can't leave no together. You have to leave Eden. &gt;&gt; And not only did he kick them out, he now blocked the way back. &gt;&gt; Like this is really picturing this is de portraying your a great uh separation now between God and man. You know, maybe Adam could sneak back in. God is like, "No, I'm making sure you're not coming back. I want you to understand the gravity of what you did. &gt;&gt; And God wasn't enjoying himself and smiling and happy when he did this. This was something that broke his heart &gt;&gt; to drive his family away. You know, I love how Brother Bam describes this scene. He says, as he was driving them away, he says, "All of a sudden, I see the Holy Spirit coming down in the funnel." And it says, "And he spelled those words L O V E, love." And then God said, "Wait, &gt;&gt; I will put enmity between your seed &gt;&gt; and the serpent seed." Just as he was driving them out, wait. Here's a promise. &gt;&gt; I will make a way for you to come back. &gt;&gt; And that's the heart of God. The heart of God is no matter what you do in your life, no matter what your sins are, you might feel the distance between you and him says, "Wait, I have a plan to bring you back." &gt;&gt; And God is always going to go after his own. Yes. &gt;&gt; If you're a seed of God, you can never hide away from God. &gt;&gt; You can run, but everywhere you go, God is. &gt;&gt; David called this revelation once and said, "Even if I lay my bed in hell, behold, he's there. &gt;&gt; Where can I go? &gt;&gt; There's nowhere you can go where God is not there." &gt;&gt; You know why? BECAUSE GOD IS not around you. &gt;&gt; God is in you. &gt;&gt; Even in your sinful form, the predestinated seed is a part of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; SO NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO, YOU ALWAYS GO WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; So you cannot escape him. God doesn't have to RUN AND FIND YOU. HE'S always there. &gt;&gt; You can say, "I'm not coming to church anymore. I'm just going to go far in the world and do whatever I want." He's there. &gt;&gt; You cannot escape him. You're a part of him. &gt;&gt; You might as well just deal with it. &gt;&gt; So this is the saddest scene in the Bible year where Adam and Eve are kicked out of Eden. for rejecting the word. &gt;&gt; And then we see in Revelation chapter 3 where Christ is kicked out of the church, &gt;&gt; right? Because the church rejected the word. &gt;&gt; And these are also both of them are the most saddest scenes in the entire Bible. Bible says imagine that Christ is kicked out of his own church. &gt;&gt; So if in Eden God made a way, he started making a way to bring men back. Amen. &gt;&gt; So surely Leodysia, he will make a way to bring the word back in the church &gt;&gt; because the word the church rejected the word and kicked him out. But God was going to devise a plan and he was going to open up the word to call out the elect of God and make his way back in the church. &gt;&gt; He's in his bride &gt;&gt; because this bride did not reject the word. This bride has been called out &gt;&gt; by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let me just lay a foundation as we're going through our thoughts. The prophet of God tells us that in the beginning, before the beginning, God was Elohim. &gt;&gt; He says, "Ela, Elohim, the self-existing one." And he could not make himself known unto us in this form. The prophecy, it was too mysterious. We could not comprehend this God who fills all space and time, who does not have a beginning, who does not have an end, who's a self-existing one. Nobody could really comprehend that. But in God, brother say the way to think about this is the purest fountain of love. I love that because too many times our relationship with God or at least the way we view God is so misconstrued &gt;&gt; and we think of God as this God of judgment and righteousness and justice who punishes sin and who's this like YOU TOLD THE LIE. This is my word. you follow I oh it's a curse sometimes that's how we think about God but the prophet is set in the record straight here the way to think about God is that he was the purest fountain of love &gt;&gt; so God is love &gt;&gt; his entire relationship with us is based on love &gt;&gt; it's not based on laws it's not based on dos and don'ts based on love &gt;&gt; and love is not a feeling &gt;&gt; right agapu is not a feelingo is a feeling. &gt;&gt; The love that I have for my brother, my sister, for my of my children, that's felio. And my feelings can get hurt. &gt;&gt; But love agapo is a being. &gt;&gt; It's a person. &gt;&gt; God is love. &gt;&gt; It's not that God has love. &gt;&gt; It's that God is love. &gt;&gt; God is not a being who happens to have feelings of love for us. God is the very essence of love. He is a fountain of love. &gt;&gt; How many believe that? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So then in this fountain of love were many attributes. The prophet says in him was the attribute of a savior. &gt;&gt; In him was an attribute of God. &gt;&gt; In him was an attribute of a healer. In him wants to be a keeper, to be a protector, to be a deliverer, to be a savior, to be a provider, to be your peace. &gt;&gt; In him were all these attributes. &gt;&gt; But this attributes lay dormant. Now the word dormant means temporarily inactive, &gt;&gt; right? Temporarily. Something is dormant, it can be awakened. &gt;&gt; And you'll find that even in genetics, there might be a dormant gene and that gets passed around from generation to generation. And at some point it gets activated. &gt;&gt; You're like, "Oh, where did this come from?" It was always there &gt;&gt; laying dormant. &gt;&gt; And it took circumstances to activate the gene that was dormant. &gt;&gt; So the genes and attributes of God were laying dormant. &gt;&gt; I'm going somewhere. &gt;&gt; And these genes were laying dormant in God. But it was going to take something &gt;&gt; to activate what was dormant to implement those genes and put them to action. What good would it be for God to be a savior when there was nobody to save? &gt;&gt; What good would it do for him to be a healer if there was nobody to heal? &gt;&gt; What's the point of buying a car if nobody's going to drive it? &gt;&gt; You're just going to leave it in the garage and just park it. So, some of these attributes would have been parked &gt;&gt; in Elohim &gt;&gt; and it just left there &gt;&gt; and they were just there without purpose because there's no way to make use of them. So Elohim dwelt by himself with himself with all his attributes in himself in the thick darkness for thousand and millions and billions and trillions of years because he has no beginning and those attributes did nothing &gt;&gt; but he was there. So then he devises a plan and it will express what's in me. And then the first thing that God does say that he created angels, right? So let me just read a quote here. He says, watch carefully now and see this. Before there was ever a speck of stardust, before God was God, God is an object of adoration and no one was there to worship him. So at that time only he was potentially God. So when Elohim existed by himself, he wasn't really God. &gt;&gt; He was potentially God. &gt;&gt; My title this morning is Elohim's potentials. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was potentially God. And he was known only as a eternal spirit. And the bride was already in his mind. Yes, she was. She was existing in his thoughts. And what about those thoughts of God? They are eternal. So we see that God was only potentially God. He was Elohim. And I can take this quote and run with it and say he was only potentially a savior. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was potentially a healer. &gt;&gt; He was potentially a deliverer. All of these were potentials &gt;&gt; in him. But he wasn't quite those things. &gt;&gt; Elohim wasn't quite God yet. He was potentially God. So then to realize his potential, what would he do? Now the word potential here means latent qualities or abilities that will have to be developed in the future for usefulness. &gt;&gt; Unless they are developed, they are not useful. &gt;&gt; And another definition here is the possibility of something of someone being able to do something. So he had the ability the latent quality to do something. Now the prophet says now all we are today here is a display of his attributes. First he was not even God. We will call him the eternal one. He wasn't God because the word God means object of worship and there was nothing to worship him. So he was just the eternal one. The main fountain of all intelligence. And in this fountain of all intelligence, there was not even an atom or a molecule or nothing light nowhere, no star, no moon, nothing else. God, what we know as God, the great spirit that was eternal that never did begin and never will end. He was there and in him was attributes, attributes to be God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then his attributes to be a father, to be a son, to be a savior, to be a healer, all of these attributes was in him. And these things that was unfolded since then are just his attributes being made manifest. Now the entire plan of redemption, the unfolding of God is his attributes being made manifest. &gt;&gt; What I mean by attributes, I mean thoughts. And a word is a thought expressed. And then that was in his thinking. And then he said, "Let there be and there was." And now remember you Christians were his thoughts before there was a world. &gt;&gt; And you are the manifestation of his thinking. &gt;&gt; My think about that. That's powerful. You were his thoughts before the beginning. &gt;&gt; And those thoughts were tangible. They were real. And then you came into time as the manifestation of what God was thinking. &gt;&gt; So if you want to know God's thoughts, you look at the bride. &gt;&gt; When I see you, I see what he was actually thinking &gt;&gt; before he created because you were his thoughts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now he says &gt;&gt; before there even was the world, you were in Christ and God in the beginning. That makes you his subjects and the whole thing is God himself materializing himself tangible. So he could be handled. Oh my. God that was invisible. God that existed by himself. God that no man could see devis a plan to condescend into time so he could be handled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And touched so he could be seen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now he says now God's secret mystery out of Christ the mystery of God revealed that he had before the word began. Now back in the back part of God's mind. I remember as brother Moses mentioned this uh during uh what we call like the SFA revival when I was in university. I was sharing this with somebody one of the students university. I said God in the back part of his mind what God wanted to do and she paused me. She said wait how do you know what God was thinking? Then I realized Maya like perhaps you don't really appreciate what the message is like for her this blew her mind. that I had the courage to tell her what God was thinking. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They don't know these things but by the opening of the word &gt;&gt; because you have received a message in these last days. You know the thoughts of God. &gt;&gt; Don't sleep on this. Don't take this as casually. You got to appreciate what the message is. &gt;&gt; It's the opening or the revelation of the thoughts of God. &gt;&gt; When we say that the seals are open, what are we meaning? &gt;&gt; It's not just symbolism. white horse rider, pale horse rider. NO, THE OPENING OF THE word is a revelation of God's thinking. &gt;&gt; We did not really understand what God thought about us &gt;&gt; until the sins were open and now we understood his thinking. &gt;&gt; That's what the book is all about is God making known unto us his thoughts. &gt;&gt; And then the prophet can stand and say, I will tell you what was in the back part of his mind. Oh my. Only the bride knows these things. &gt;&gt; But now he's about to tell us. Do you want to know what was in the backbone of his mind? &gt;&gt; He had a motive in doing this in order to let himself be expressed. &gt;&gt; There wasn't even a moon, a star, and an atom and a molecule. He was God, but he wasn't exactly God because God is an object of worship and there was nothing to worship him. And in his great mind, he wanted these attributes to be expressed. And in him was love, was father, was son, was to be a savior. In him was to be a healer. And all these great attributes that we see expressed today, they were once in God. Now he says, "So my opinion, the first thing that he made was angels." Now listen to this. This is very important here. And it says, "And then they angels worshiped him and that made him God." &gt;&gt; Amen. And then he started from there. Okay, let's pause here. I personally when I read the prophet, I like to really understand what he's saying. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes you listen to a tape and brother Brandham, there's nobody who could preach like brother in one paragraph he will say three or four sentences there that you can preach for five years and then he moves on to something else like he just didn't drop a bomb. [snorts] Like h how do you just say that the angels worship him and that if you want to underline that that &gt;&gt; made him God? &gt;&gt; What is he saying here? That Elohim was only potentially God. &gt;&gt; And then that potential was realized when there was somebody to worship him. &gt;&gt; Once he created angels, the attribute of God that was dormant was awakened. And now he realized that potential. He was no longer potentially God. HE BECAME GOD. &gt;&gt; HE [screaming] ACTUALLY BECAME GOD. &gt;&gt; Now when you talk about potentials, you can talk about a young man and say, "I see a lot of potentials in you &gt;&gt; and and you would hate to see those potentials go to waste." &gt;&gt; So then you want that that young man to apply himself so he can actually become all that he's able to become. Amen. &gt;&gt; He has a potential to become, but he needs to do something so he becomes. &gt;&gt; Every male has a potential to be a father. &gt;&gt; Every female here has a potential to be a mother. BUT WHEN IT ACTUALLY happens when you have a baby, that baby makes you dad. &gt;&gt; That baby makes you mom. &gt;&gt; I'm going somewhere. &gt;&gt; So these attributes, angels made him God. Amen. &gt;&gt; He could not be God unless someone was going to worship him. &gt;&gt; And when they worship him, they realized that attribute. It came alive. &gt;&gt; And brother says he started from there. &gt;&gt; That's where he started. He's like, "Okay, now one of them is alive. One of them got activated. &gt;&gt; I have made him to activate it." &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. &gt;&gt; So God's motive and objective in creation was to express his attributes to express his full potential and that made him go when the angels worship him. And then the next thing God does now is create man. He makes Adam and then he says it is not good for man to be alone. So I'm going to make him a helpmate. And now God for the first time on the earth has a family. He has a son and his daughter. He wanted to be a father. Now he did it. &gt;&gt; Now Adam and Eve made him father &gt;&gt; the same way angels made him God. &gt;&gt; And now God and father this attributes are now quickened. And now God has a family on earth. All the thrill. Oh what joy that was. Imagine the joy of God in his soul. HE SAYS, "I HAVE A family now." &gt;&gt; You know, it's such a joy when you actually accomplish the purpose that you had in your heart. &gt;&gt; And when you think about it, you say, "Okay, one day I'm going to build this house. It's going to be like this. It's going to be this. It's going to this many rooms." And you ponder on this. And you plan and you devise it and then you see it. &gt;&gt; It's such a joy to see your thinking made manifest. &gt;&gt; These were the things that I was thinking about. I WANTED TO HAVE A FAMILY. I wanted to be a father. Now I have children. &gt;&gt; Says, but you know, it began to get evening time and the sun was setting and Adam said, "Sweetheart, we must go up to the cathedral. We've got to go worship." It wasn't a denomination. It was in a great big forest. They went up and knelt down at the sun. As the sun was going down and father came down, &gt;&gt; the lightnings flashed, the thunders rolled and a beautiful majestic light sailed over the bushes and it come down. I can hear the loving voice of the father say, "Children, have you enjoyed yourself today?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Papa has come to kiss you good night and lay you down for the night and the kiss upon the cheek of Adam and the kiss upon the cheek of Eve. Now think about this now. The relationship that Adam and Eve have with God is greater than the one angels have with God. &gt;&gt; Because Adam and Eve now know God in a greater way than the angels. &gt;&gt; Because to the angels, he was only an object of worship. &gt;&gt; That's all they knew. They were created to worship him. To the angels, God was the one you worship. To Adam and Eve, he was that and more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To Adam and Eve, he was an object of worship, but he was also papa, &gt;&gt; daddy, &gt;&gt; father. &gt;&gt; Right? So, for the first time here, there was a creature on earth that called God to God. For the angels, he was God. Holy, holy is the Lord God. God is holy. God is no like God, God, God, God. to Adam and Eve. He was dad. &gt;&gt; That's a different relationship. He's not just my God. He's my father. &gt;&gt; And that relationship that Adam and Eve had with God, the angels did not have. &gt;&gt; So to Adam and Eve, God expressed more attributes &gt;&gt; than he did to the angels. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? &gt;&gt; All right. So when he created man in Adam were also attributes in Adam was attribute to be a husband was an attribute to be a father was all these attributes but they also laid dormant just like God's attributes laid dormant in God Adam's attributes lay dormant in him &gt;&gt; but God wanted Adam to also express his attributes And the only way for Adam to express express all his attributes was for God to give him a helpmate because he could not be a father unless he had a wife. He couldn't be a wife unless there was a female that God created to give it to him. Right? So then God gave Adam a vessel, a helpmate, a bride, a wife, so that through her he can actualize all his potentials. So that through Eve, Adam can actually be all that he can be. &gt;&gt; You following me so far? &gt;&gt; All right. So the only way for Adam to express all of this was for Adam to have a helpmate. And God laid a law in Eden, the law of the seed here. As you know this, when he put the seed in the earth, the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it to transform it from a seed to a plant or whatever it was. He's transforming power. Now, God put the seed in there with potentials that it would be what he said it would be. &gt;&gt; You can rest assure that that every single seed will be what God said &gt;&gt; it will be. &gt;&gt; Every seed that has the potentials in it will be quickened to bring forth what God said it will be. If you're a seed of God, in you lays the power to be all that God has called you to be. &gt;&gt; The power TO BE A SON OF GOD DOESN'T come from elsewhere. &gt;&gt; The power to be a son comes from within. &gt;&gt; Cuz God cannot take eternal life and take it out and bring it in you. There's already eternal life in you potentially in seed form. And when it gets quickened, that's where the new birth is. Amen. &gt;&gt; The new birth doesn't make you son of God. &gt;&gt; Brother says, "When did you become a son? The night you got saved?" No, &gt;&gt; you don't become a son of God because you gave your heart to the Lord. &gt;&gt; No, you give your heart to the Lord because you always were a son of God, &gt;&gt; right? Because only the elect can be reborn. &gt;&gt; You You don't become seed when you get THE HOLY GHOST. BECAUSE YOU ARE SEED, you get the HOLY GHOST. THAT'S WHY YOU GET THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; Rest in peace. That's what people sometimes they strive like I need to get the Holy Ghost and I. It's not by your might or by your power. The Holy Ghost is a consequence &gt;&gt; of being seed. &gt;&gt; If you are seed in these last days, you will have the HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; YOU WILL GET IT. &gt;&gt; I was reading brother Brandham, I think it was in the church book and you was talking about how can I overcome? And it says that she is a word bride. It says and she conquers all things. I think that's how he says it. And as I was reading it, it strike me because the Bible says, "To him that will overcome. To him that will overcome. To him that will overcome." &gt;&gt; And then sometimes overcoming can become the goal. &gt;&gt; Okay? I have to overcome. That's the goal. &gt;&gt; Then I realized overcoming is not the goal, it's a consequence. &gt;&gt; The goal is for the bride to be the word. &gt;&gt; Cuz if the bride is the word, as a consequence, she overcomes. So sometimes we focus on the wrong thing. I need to overcome. No, feed on the word. &gt;&gt; Become the word. And if the word lives in you, that word will overcome. And overcoming will become a result of the word that's in you. &gt;&gt; There it is. &gt;&gt; So now every seed has to bring forth after his kind. So Adam also all the potentials that lay in the seed that was in him had to bring himself to manifestation. So that God only had to give him a vessel or Eve so that he could be all that he is. Now in doing so, God introduced in Eden a weaker vessel. Think about this. Everything that God created was strong and fortified. And Eve is the only one that brethren calls the weaker vessel. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it says it's an old battle that started way back beyond time and Satan and his angels were kicked out and they come to the earth and the battle set in again because Eve broke down the barrier from where she was isolated behind the word of God and from that very hour Satan won the battle over God's word because one of his subjects the weaker one let down the bars. So now because of weakness, Eve, &gt;&gt; because of weakness introduced in Eden, humanity is now in chaos. &gt;&gt; And now Adam is going to portray something that Adam himself did not know was in him. &gt;&gt; Eve is going to sin as we read. And now Adam, who is God on the earth, who is supposed to be the legislator, the lawkeeper, the righteous judge, he looks at the situation and he's supposed to pronounce the judgment. What will happen here? But instead, we see Adam take his wife unto himself and he expresses mercy and grace. &gt;&gt; And now mercy and grace are two different things. Mercy is if the is when the one who is in the position of power withholds the penalty, &gt;&gt; right? If I have power over you and your faith is in my hands and I withhold the penalty, that's mercy. I showed you mercy. Grace is unmmerited favor. It's when I express to you something that you did not deserve. And then we see Adam portraying those two things, right? Because he does not pronounce judgment on Eve, mercy. And then he gives himself for Eve grace. &gt;&gt; And now these attributes were in Adam &gt;&gt; and Adam did not know they were in him. &gt;&gt; It took weakness introduced in Eden &gt;&gt; so that Adam could now express those attributes. And I love that Adam expressed them before God ever expressed them &gt;&gt; because Adam was a reflector of God. HE'S ONLY DOING WHAT GOD WILL DO. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; So then Adam parttook of Eve sin because he was going to have his wife no matter what. &gt;&gt; Adam looked Eden and perfection. Sin and sickness. Eden and perfection without Eve. Sin with Eve. What do I do? And Adam, remember this decision was made when Adam was in theophony form, right? When he was in glorified form, he did not make this decision as he seen. He had not sinned yet. He saw what happened. &gt;&gt; He made the decision when he was in his right form. So that decision was only a reflection of what God would do in hisstead. &gt;&gt; It says perfection without Eve is not worth having. Think about that. Now, God had a chance to have the world with no sin, but without you. And then God had to choose. Do I keep perfection or do I step in time &gt;&gt; to go get my bride back? &gt;&gt; AND TO GOD, YOU were worth everything. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Now because of this chaos introduced by Eve, God comes down and says, "Adam, where are you?" And the way I think about this is now for the first time since God has made man, there was now an opportunity for other attributes of God to be quickened. So now God comes down and then he sees that his family has fallen into sin. And as a father, that broke his heart. OH NO, MY FAMILY. But wait a minute, as a savior, he got quickened. &gt;&gt; Where the heart of the father was broken, the heart of the savior WAS QUICKENED. BECAUSE NOW THERE ARE SINNERS ON EARTH THAT A SAVIOR can now save. &gt;&gt; Now because of what happened in Eden, THERE WILL BE SICKNESS INTRODUCED. AND NOW A HEALER CANNOT BE EXPRESSED. Not because OF SIN THERE'S NOT FEAR BUT now the one who speaks cannot be expressed. And now this father in Eden was the catalyst for Elohim to not display all that he is. Amen. &gt;&gt; So it was okay for God to allow sin temporarily &gt;&gt; to step out of eternity and step into time and allow sin in time so that he can come and get you &gt;&gt; and express himself to you and make himself known unto you. &gt;&gt; And now I want you to think about this. Because of what happened in Eden, there's going to be a first time where God would hear a man call him my provider. &gt;&gt; I want you to think about this. God had never heard those words before. &gt;&gt; Nobody had ever called God provider before. &gt;&gt; And now for the first time, a son of God will pray and say, "Lord, you are my provider. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; FOR THE FIRST TIME, SOMEBODY WILL CALL HIM my savior, &gt;&gt; MY HEALER. &gt;&gt; AND ALL THOSE ATTRIBUTES WERE ALWAYS IN HIM. AND FOR THOUSAND AND MILLIONS OF YEARS, NOBODY KNEW GOD AS THAT. BUT NOW, BECAUSE OF SIN IN EDEN, THERE'S GOING TO BE A PEOPLE NOW. AND I CAN CALL HIM WHAT HE IS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, the one who knows him as God can only worship him because they know him as God. &gt;&gt; The one who knows him as a savior worships him because he's a savior. &gt;&gt; That's why the worship of angels is so limited. &gt;&gt; They only know him as God. And God enjoyed it. It was like, it's not quite what I want because you ONLY SEE ONE SIDE OF ME. &gt;&gt; I'M MORE THAN JUST AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP. I need to have people that are going TO WORSHIP ME FOR EVERYTHING THAT I AM. &gt;&gt; DON'T WITHHOLD YOUR WORSHIP FROM GOD BECAUSE THE ANGELS WORSHIP WERE NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR HIM THAT HE ALLOWED THE FALSE THAT WHEN YOU WORSHIP HIM, &gt;&gt; HE'S VERY SATISFIED BECAUSE ONLY YOU KNOW HIM THE WAY YOU know him. &gt;&gt; And when I mean when I say you, I don't mean the church. I mean you &gt;&gt; as an individual &gt;&gt; only you can worship God that way &gt;&gt; because what GOD HAS BEEN TO YOU I DON'T KNOW &gt;&gt; BUT I CAN TELL YOU WHAT HE HAS BEEN TO ME. &gt;&gt; So when I GO TO HIM AND PRAY AND WORSHIP IT SAYS OH GOD YOU'RE MY FATHER &gt;&gt; CUZ I HAVE A FATHER SON RELATIONSHIP. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE HIM AS A FATHER. I CAN SAY YOU'RE MY HEALER BECAUSE I'VE SEEN HIM HEAL ME TIMES AND TIMES AGAIN. I CAN GO TO HIM AND SAY, "YOU'RE MY PROVIDER, LORD." BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN HE STEPPED IN MY LIFE AND PROVIDED. AND I CAN SAY, "YOU'RE A WAY MAKER, OH GOD, BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN I WAS LOST AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, HE CAME AND MADE A WAY FOR ME. &gt;&gt; I CAN SAY YOU'RE MY RESCUER BECAUSE HE CAME TO ME WHEN I COULDN'T GO TO HIM AND HE RESCUED ME." &gt;&gt; THAT'S HOW I WORSHIP HIM. &gt;&gt; HOW DO [screaming] YOU WORSHIP HIM? &gt;&gt; You know him the way YOU KNOW HIM. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY KNOW HIM AS A SAVIOR? &gt;&gt; HOW MANY know him as a healer? How many know him as a deliverer? YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE BEING CHAINED. AND GOD COMES BY THE POWER OF HIS WORD AND SETS YOU FREE. AND WHEN YOU WORSHIP HIM, [screaming] YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGE HE BROUGHT IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHERE YOU WERE. I DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW HOW FAR YOU WERE AND HOW FAR HIS LOVE WENT TO PULL YOU OUT. WHEN YOU WORSHIP HIM, ANGELS CAN WORSHIP THE WAY YOU DO. TAKE THE SHACKLES OF MY FEET SO I CAN DANCE. BREAK THE CHAIN SO I CAN LIFT MY HEAD. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO REJOICE BEFORE GOD BECAUSE I KNOW [screaming] &gt;&gt; I KNOW HIM. &gt;&gt; NO WONDER WHEN THE ARK CAME BACK, DAVID STARTED REJOICING CUZ DAVID KNOW WHAT THE ARK REPRESENTED TO HIM. &gt;&gt; HE WAS A SHEPHERD BOY SOMEWHERE. NOBODY KNEW DAVID. WHEN GOD CAME AND TOOK HIM OUT OF BETHLEHEM AND JESSE'S HOUSE AND MADE HIM KING &gt;&gt; WHEN HE SAW THE WORD RETURN, HE DID SOMETHING FOR DAVID. &gt;&gt; CUZ ONLY DAVID KNEW WHAT GOD DID FOR HIM. &gt;&gt; What does it mean to you? &gt;&gt; Don't come to church and say, "Okay, I got to compare my worship to that brother's worship." &gt;&gt; Oh, he's quiet, so I had to be quiet, too. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. He doesn't know what you've been through. &gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T KNOW. YOU HAD TO WORSHIP GOD to reflect WHAT YOU KNOW HIM TO BE. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Not just because OF WHO HE IS, BUT WHO HE HAS been to you. &gt;&gt; WHAT ATTRIBUTE YOU'VE EXPERIENCE IN YOUR LIFE? &gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW HIM AS A SAVIOR? &gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW HIM AS A KEEPER? DO YOU KNOW HIM AS [screaming] A FATHER? &gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW HIM AS A HUSBAND? [laughter] &gt;&gt; Do you KNOW HIM AS A PROMISEKEEPER? HAVE YOU EVER HELD ON TO A PROMISE IN SPITE OF CIRCUMSTANCES YEAR AFTER YEAR AND SEE IT COME TO PASS &gt;&gt; AND YOU CAN SAY I KNOW [screaming] HIM &gt;&gt; THAT HE KEEPS HIS PROMISE. &gt;&gt; HE KEEPS HIS WORD. &gt;&gt; I KNOW HIM. &gt;&gt; NOT THEORY. I KNOW [screaming] &gt;&gt; IN WHOM I BELIEVE AND I'M PERSUADED. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO KNOW AND THEN YOU HAVE TO BE PERSUADED. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO KNOW HE'S GOD. YOU MUST BE PERSUADED THAT HE IS GOD. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT enough to be convinced. You must be concerned &gt;&gt; to know and to be persuaded &gt;&gt; that he is God. &gt;&gt; AND IT TOOK SIN FOR GOD TO make himself known unto you &gt;&gt; in a way that you can have a relationship with him that only you can. &gt;&gt; And now God gets you in joy. I will worship. And each one of you has a different smelling flavor to God. It's different for all of us. &gt;&gt; The one who's experienced healing, when it comes to God, he knows he's a healer. &gt;&gt; The one who has never experienced healing cannot relate. &gt;&gt; We can sing the same songs. &gt;&gt; The song leader can come and say, "Let's stand and we all raise our hands. Jehovah." We all sing my proider. &gt;&gt; To some, it's words. to somebody else's is experience. &gt;&gt; Two different things. And then you wonder why somebody can get so ENTHUSED AND SAYS JEHOVAH GYRA MY PROVIDER. [screaming] YOU'RE LIKE, "OH, THIS BROTHER IS A FANATIC." NO, YOU DON'T KNOW. HE'S BEEN IN CONTACT WITH A PROVIDER. &gt;&gt; AN ATTRIBUTE THAT WAS DORMANT. THIS BROTHER OR SISTER HAS BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THAT ATTRIBUTE. THAT'S WHY THEY SING THE WAY THEY SING. Like this brother is a little bit too LOUD IN CHURCH. YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS. YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THE LOVE OF GOD FOUND HIM. &gt;&gt; I WAS THERE WHEN IT HAPPENED TO ME. SO I OUGHT TO [screaming] KNOW. &gt;&gt; I was THERE WHEN JESUS FOUND ME. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Don't come and tell me WHAT TO DO. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I KNOW. &gt;&gt; Let's just leave it at that. I KNOW WHERE I WAS. &gt;&gt; I KNOW WHAT I USED TO BE. I KNOW WHAT I USED TO DO. I KNOW WHAT I WHERE I USED TO GO. AND THAT [screaming] MAN IS DEAD. &gt;&gt; AND I'M A DIFFERENT MAN TODAY. AND THE ONE WHO DID IT IS ELOHIM. AND HE CAME IN THE FLESH AS A SAVIOR. AND HE CAME IN MY LIFE AS A DELIVERER. I KNOW [screaming] HIM BETTER. &gt;&gt; And now angels are watching God do this. God comes and kicks them out. But he devised a plan to redeem them. And angels say, "Oh my, he is a redeemer." &gt;&gt; News flash, ANGELS ARE MORE THAN JUST AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; NOW, angels begin to see a side of God they've never quite seen before. &gt;&gt; And now, thanks to the fall. You heard me right. &gt;&gt; I didn't say because of the fall. I say thanks to the fall. &gt;&gt; Thanks to the fall, these attributes of God are what we get to experience. You know, God could have created us all perfect without sin. We will be no different than angels. &gt;&gt; He will have a good family on earth like he did Adam and Eve, but we only know him as a father and as a God. We will not know what it's like to be so alone, &gt;&gt; so abandoned by everyone &gt;&gt; and you cannot even express to anybody how you feel. But he comes to you in the privacy of your prayer room and then he ministers to you. &gt;&gt; You will never know what that's like. &gt;&gt; You will never know what it's like to have peace that surpasses all understanding. When nothing makes sense in your life, but still there is peace. &gt;&gt; Some of you when YOU BELIEVE THE MESSAGE, EVERYBODY FORSOOK YOU. YOUR FRIENDS, YOUR PARENTS, YOUR FAMILY, EVERYBODY, AND YOU ARE ALL ALONE. AND GOD COME AND SAY, "WALK WITH ME. &gt;&gt; It's just it's just you and me." YOU WILL NEVER KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE. &gt;&gt; So now we know that a tree is recognized by its fruits. &gt;&gt; A tree doesn't need to tell us what it is. &gt;&gt; What it is. &gt;&gt; You're walking by a tree, you see some apples. Oh, that's an apple tree. Right? You tell the tree what it is by the fruits it bears. A tree doesn't say, "Hey, by pastor, I am an apple tree." No, the fruits it bears tells you what it is. And God is identified by his characteristics. &gt;&gt; In other words, many began to tell God what he is. Why? By the fruits he was bearing. &gt;&gt; God didn't have to come AND TELL US, "I'M A SAVIOR." NO, HE saved and then the fruits OF SALVATION AND I TOLD HIM [screaming] YOU ARE MY SAVIOR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD DIDN'T COME AND SAY I'M A HEALER. NO, HE SAYS MOSES RAISED THE BRASS SERPENT AND LET THE PEOPLE LOOKED AND LIVE. And when the people looked and THEY WERE HEALED, THEY SAY HE [screaming] IS A HEALER. &gt;&gt; THEY BEGAN TO TELL HIM WHAT FRUITS HE WAS BEARING. THEY BEGIN TO RECOGNIZE WHAT ATTRIBUTES HE WAS MANIFESTING. &gt;&gt; We begin to tell him what he is. &gt;&gt; And that's why we can pray. He says, "You are so lovely. &gt;&gt; You are all lovely." Why? Because of the fruits he bears in my life. I tell him, "You are lovely." &gt;&gt; You know, brother Moses says, "Brother Ray is a song leader." Brother Ray didn't come and say, "I'm a song leader." &gt;&gt; He just bore fruits &gt;&gt; by the fruits he bears. We tell him what it is. Amen. &gt;&gt; I was told that I was a preacher long before I started preaching. &gt;&gt; I never said, "Oh, I want to be a preacher. I'm a preacher." No, I just bore fruits. &gt;&gt; And then people looked at me and I looked at the fruit and says, "You're a preacher. You're going to be a preacher. You're going to preacher." THAT'S THE SAME THING. GOD JUST DISPLAYED his attributes. &gt;&gt; And then WE BEGAN TO TELL HIM, "YOU'RE MY SAVIOR. YOU'RE MY HEALER. YOU'RE MY DELIVERER. YOU'RE MY PROVIDER." &gt;&gt; WORDS FAIL. THERE'S TOO MANY WORDS. YOU'RE MY WAY MAKER. WHO CAME UP WITH THAT? WAY MAKER. SOMEBODY WHO SAW GOD ME A WAY CALLED HIM WAY MAKER. &gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU CALL HIM AS? &gt;&gt; YOU'VE SEEN HIM DO WHAT HE DOES. &gt;&gt; TELL HIM WHAT HE has been to you. &gt;&gt; That's what true worship is. When he reflects back to God, this is what you have been to me. Good. &gt;&gt; And I can prove this to you by the scripture because in Genesis 22:14, it tells us, "And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said,"Abraham, Abraham." And he said, "Here I am." And he said, "Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him, for now I know, did thou fearest God, seeing that thou has not withheld thy son, thy only son, from me." And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him a ram was caught in the thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering &gt;&gt; in thestead of his son. And Abraham called the name of the place Jehovah Gyra. &gt;&gt; And it said to this day, in the month of the Lord, it shall BE SEEN. NOW GOD DIDN'T COME TO ABRAHAM SAYS ABRAHAM withhold your hand from YOUR SON BECAUSE I AM JEHOVAH GYRA. No he only provided a ram. And when Abraham SAW THAT HE SAYS I WILL CALL YOU JEHOVAH GYRA BECAUSE YOU HAVE SEEN ME AND YOU HAVE PROVIDED FOR ME. And now we can all sing Jehovah Gyra. You know who called that revelation first? Abraham. We sing songs today because a man called God Jehovah Gyra. A MAN CALLED GOD who he is. We can see it again in Exodus 17:15. He says, "And the Lord said unto Moses, write this for a memorial in the book and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua, for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalecch from under the heaven." And Moses built an altar and called the name of it Jehovah Nissi. For he said, because the Lord had sworn that the Lord will have war with Amalecch, Nissi is our banner. AND THEY SAW GOD STAND BEFORE THEM AND DEFEAT THE AMALACHITES. And they called him Jehovahi. &gt;&gt; And the Lord said unto Gideon, "Peace be unto thee. Fear not, thou shalt not die." Then Gideon built an altar there unto the Lord and called it Jehovah Shalom. &gt;&gt; Who told God it was Jehovah Shalom? Gideon. God just express his attributes and then we saw it for what it is and we say that's what you are. Matthew chapter 16. When Jesus came into the course of Philippi, Cesaria Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, "Whom do men say that I, the son of God, I, the son of man, am?" And they said, "Some say that you are John the Baptist. Some say you're Elias, others Jeremiah or one of the prophets." But he said unto them, "Who do you say &gt;&gt; I am?" &gt;&gt; That's the question he's asking you this morning. WHO DO YOU SAY I AM? OR SOME SAY YOU'RE A PROVIDER. SOME SAY YOU'RE A KEEPER. SOME SAY YOU'RE A HEALER. OKAY. BUT what do YOU SAY ABOUT ME? WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN IN YOUR LIFE? WHAT HAVE I DONE FOR YOU? WHO DO YOU SAY I AM? WHAT ATTRIBUTES HAVE YOU SEEN IN YOUR LIFE? &gt;&gt; And then Peter answers, "Thou art the Christ." &gt;&gt; PETER SAW SOMETHING. HE SAW THAT THIS MAN Jesus was AN ATTRIBUTE OF GOD THAT WAS IN ELOHIM. And that attribute came down in time and was made manifest in the flesh. And that was the Christ OF GOD. THAT'S WHAT PETER SAW. That's powerful. &gt;&gt; Peter didn't see just a prophet. He's like, "No, no, no. This is more than a prophet. What I'm seeing here is an attribute that was in Elohim. &gt;&gt; The son of God has come down into time and is made manifest in THE FLESH. YOU ARE THE CHRIST." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. the the dying thief of the cross say remember me when you will come in your kingdom. &gt;&gt; So this man in the dying minutes of his life &gt;&gt; recognizes this man is a king. &gt;&gt; HE SAW AN ATTRIBUTE IN HIM WAS THE ABILITY TO BE KING AND HERE AT THE CROSS IS A KING. &gt;&gt; What have you seen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What seeest thou? What do you see in THESE LAST DAYS? &gt;&gt; WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU IN THESE LAST DAYS? WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THIS MINISTRY? Could this be Malachi 4? Could this be Revelation 10? WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN? Elijah the prophet. &gt;&gt; You know what Elijah the prophet is? Program says that Elijah is Christ himself. &gt;&gt; I can read the quote if you want. Elijah is Jesus Christ himself. We used to think that Elijah was brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; Elijah is Jesus Christ himself that comes in the form of a prophet. He uses A PROPHET. THAT'S WHAT FULFILLS MALACHI 4 IS WHEN CHRIST HIMSELF COMES TO YOU BY THE WAY OF A PROPHET. THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE IN THIS LAST DAYS. &gt;&gt; Some saw a healing gift. &gt;&gt; You saw the word open up. Now we read that out of a curse will come the blessing of Abraham. Brother says God's holiness, God being God, he projects that himself wasn't a sinner. He would have never been a savior. And but he was a savior at the beginning, but there was nothing lost. And his own attributes as being a savior, now listen to this, projected a sinner. There had to be something to be saved. Before there could be anything saved, there had to be something lost. And in his righteousness and in his holiness, there would have never been a sick person. He would never been a healer. But from the beginning of the beginnings, he was even before the beginning, he was a healer. So there was nothing sick. So he projected a sick person that he might heal them to make him [snorts] a healer. It's powerful to me because I used to think that sin projected a sinner, projected sickness. But a prophet corrects me here. He says God, his attributes projected a sinner. Think about it. God was a healer. And to be a healer, somebody had to be sick. So he is the one who's actually at the origin of the plan of redemption by allowing Satan to come and deceive Eve. God is the one who orchestrates this. See the devil thinks that when he won in Eden that that was his doing. He's like I came and I destroy the plan of God. I come and I destroy his family and he went his way rejoicing. God is like thanks Satan. That was part of my plan. Thanks. Thanks for doing that. &gt;&gt; And then the devil rejoices AND HE IS HAPPY. HE THINKS THAT HE WON. GOD IS LIKE, "YEP, that's exactly what I had planned because now that attribute projected the sinner. Now I can go save." And then you think that the devil gets any credit. He doesn't get any credit &gt;&gt; for anything that happens in your life. He does not get any credit. Believers are too QUICK TO SAY THE DEVIL DID THIS, THE DEVIL DID THAT, HE DID NOTHING. &gt;&gt; God is at the origin of everything. &gt;&gt; How do I know this? The Bible tells us that before Satan came to Job, he went to God. &gt;&gt; The the devil DID NOT COME BY PER adventure and I'm just going to go ahead in Job's life and start destroying his life. No, no, no. HE WENT TO GOD &gt;&gt; AND GOD SAID, "HAVE you considered &gt;&gt; Job?" &gt;&gt; He's like, "Yeah, yeah, well, you know, you've blessed him and you've protected him. What do you expect?" He's like, "Well, go ahead. Do whatever you want, but here are the parameters. You can do this. You can do that, you can do this, but you can't do that. &gt;&gt; He's like, "Okay." And then the devil comes and ABRA IS LIKE, "THE DEVIL DID THIS TO ME. HE DID THIS TO ME." JOB IS LIKE, "THE DEVIL DID THIS." IT'S LIKE, "NO, it's not the devil." God is like, "I did this. I did this." So the devil gets zero credit. I don't want to give him credit for the bad things that happened in my life because it's going to make him feel like he does things. He's going to make you feel like he has some power over me. LIKE YOU HAVE NO POWER OVER ME. If I'm sick, GOD ALLOW ME TO BE SICK &gt;&gt; FOR A PURPOSE. &gt;&gt; EITHER TO HEAL ME OR FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE. BUT THE DEVIL GETS ZERO CREDIT. &gt;&gt; ZERO. HE THINKS HE'S SO USEFUL. HE IS USEFUL TO GOD. BUT IN HIMSELF, HE IS NOTHING. &gt;&gt; ZERO POWER. HE COULD NOT EVEN COME TO JOB, A MAN UNDER THE BLOOD OF BULLS AND GOATS WITHOUT PERMISSION. HOW ABOUT YOU? AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; YOU THINK HE CAN LAY HIS HANDS ON YOU WITHOUT PERMISSION? &gt;&gt; THINK TWICE. &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL DOESN'T have the license to just walk in your life AND START DOING WHATEVER HE WANTS. THOSE THINGS DO NOT HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; HE wants you to believe HE HAS THE POWER to do that. HE DOES NOT HAVE. &gt;&gt; BEFORE anything happens to your life, the devil has to go to God &gt;&gt; and then negotiate with God. &gt;&gt; Right? Right? Cuz he negotiated. The first time God said, "Go ahead, &gt;&gt; take all that he has." He did everything. And he came back. God says, "See," he's like, "Well, you didn't let me touch him." And he's negotiating. He's like, "Can can I can I touch his life, too?" Okay, fine. But don't take his life. So any power that the devil is given over us, &gt;&gt; is given by God &gt;&gt; with parameters. So the devil can only go as far as God would allow him to go. &gt;&gt; That's all. REST IN PEACE. THE DEVIL CAN ONLY GO AS FAR. THERE'S A CHAIN ON HIM LIKE A DOG HAS CHAIN. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN BARK AND CAN'T BARK BUT AND THEN YOU STOP AND THE CHAIN PULLS you back and you try and the chain pulls you back. When the devil COMES IN YOUR LIFE SAYS GO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT AND THEN HE TRIES TO GO FURTHER. COME BACK HERE. &gt;&gt; That's it. THOSE ARE THE PARAMETERS. GOD IS IN CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE. HE GETS ALL THE CREDIT, ALL THE PRAISE, [screaming] ALL THE GLORY IN THE GOOD TIMES, IN THE BAD TIMES, IN THE WORST TIMES. YOU MIGHT GO THROUGH THE WORST TIME AS A FAMILY, AS A CHURCH. GOD [screaming] GETS THE credit &gt;&gt; because he only allows weakness so that he can show his strength. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we wonder, Lord, why did you let these things happen to me? &gt;&gt; Why did you let me go through these things or why did you let these things happen to the church? For a reason. &gt;&gt; And the reason is that God wants to express himself to you more than what you know. Amen. &gt;&gt; Out of that same holy realm yonder that comes salvation comes a curse. Out of the same mother and father that projected Jacob, he projected Esau. &gt;&gt; Says there has to be something lost to be saved. Him being a savior, he made that the deep calls to the deep. &gt;&gt; So he could not even be a savior unless I was lost. The only reason why I was lost is because he was a savior in the first place. &gt;&gt; The only reason God let you get sick is because he's a healer. &gt;&gt; In other words, you can never find yourself in a situation or circumstance that God is not the answer to. &gt;&gt; Or else he will not allow it. &gt;&gt; The things he allows, he's the answer to. He allows sin because he's a savior. He allows sickness because he's a healer. HE ALLOWS US BECAUSE HE HAS THE ANSWER TO IT. SO YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE GOD IS NOT THE ANSWER. IF HE ALLOWS IT, HE IS THE ANSWER. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we get sick and then we get the wrong attitude because we think that maybe we did something wrong. Maybe God is mad at us. Maybe he's punishing us. But the way God looks at it, he says, "I just want to find my fulfillment in you." Because he is made perfect in our weakness. &gt;&gt; He's fulfilled in our weakness. Now, I want to come to a close with this thought here. I'll build up to this. We talked about God having all these attributes of healer, savior, deliverer. All those are attributes. But so were you. I want you to think about this. In God was an attribute to be a savior. But you were also an attribute in God. How many know that's true? You know that that's what the prophet say that you are attributes in him. Okay. Let me just read this for you. Now here we are coming to a conclusion. as the eternal logos was manifest in the son and Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that eternal one was the father manifest in the flesh and thereby gain the title of son I love how the the prophet says this because the title of son is given to the eternal father made manifest in the flesh that's what the son of god is is the father made manifest in the flesh but then he goes on to say even so We eternal in his thoughts in our turn just just like Jesus in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed manifest in the flesh and those eternal thoughts now manifest in the flesh of the sons of God even as we are so-called he's saying why are we called sons of God that title sons of God means that we were the eternal thoughts of God and now we're made manifest in the flesh. In other words, we were attributes that were in God and now we are expressed. Just like savior was an attribute that was expressed, you were an attribute that was expressed. Just like deliverer was dormant and then expressed, you were laying dormant in him and now you've been expressed. Therefore, you gain the title of sons of God. &gt;&gt; Okay? Now, I want you to think about it this way. God was potentially God. That attribute was dormant and then God did something so that that attribute can made can be made manifest and be quickened. Right? Now you were dormant in him and then God did something to allow you to be expressed so that you can be quickened and now he you can be expressed as a nature that was in him. So if in God an attribute means the ability to become right if God had the ability to be a savior or the potential to be a savior element's potential and then I was an attribute in him I'm also his potentials. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now I want to say to you this way that means that God had the potential to become me. I think about that &gt;&gt; he had the potential to be a savior, &gt;&gt; to be a healer, but I am also an attribute which means he had the potential to become me. &gt;&gt; That's Elohim's potential that IN HIM WERE ATTRIBUTES AND GOD HAD THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME FLESH IN HIS ATTRIBUTES. &gt;&gt; WHAT AM I THE WHAT AM I TRYING TO SAY? THE DESIRE OF GOD WAS TO BECOME FLESH. The Bible says he became me, RIGHT? HE BECAME ME THAT I MAY BECOME THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD. GOD WANTED TO DWELL IN HUMAN FLESH. &gt;&gt; GO READ who is this miser. That's what he says. He says he started condescending and making himself into the flesh. He started as a as a logos. He came as a theophony. Then that theophony came in the flesh to visit Abraham. And then that theophony was made flesh &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ. That's what he says. Amen. &gt;&gt; And now HE SAYS, "NOW WE ARE the many membered spoken word." In other words, God Elohim, HE'S NOW REALIZING HIS potentials by dwelling in your flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To me, that's powerful. THAT A SON OF GOD IS GOD EXPRESSED IN THE FLESH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE. YOU ARE AN ATTRIBUTE OF GOD. YOU COME FROM GOD. YOU GO BACK TO GOD. AND GOD HAS STEPPED INTO TIME &gt;&gt; IN YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO THAT HE can live HIS LIFE AND EXPRESS HIS LIFE THROUGH YOU. &gt;&gt; You want to see God, you look to your left and you look to your right. &gt;&gt; Where do you think God is? &gt;&gt; When God created, &gt;&gt; he created angels. He created the sun, the stars, the moon, and everything. And then he created men and then he rested. He didn't make anything after man. Right? You know why? Because brothers and sisters, the creation was the expression of his attributes. He was showing all that he is. &gt;&gt; But when he created man, he stopped there. Because man is the final expression of God. &gt;&gt; There's nothing up to man. When God made man, that was to express him. THE WAY TO SEE GOD IS TO LOOK AT MAN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHITE MEN, SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; HE HAD THE POTENTIAL TO BE YOU. AND BECAUSE OF SIN, HE STEPPED INTO TIME AND THROUGH REDEMPTION, HE BECAME YOU. &gt;&gt; WHAT AM I LOOKING AT HERE? SONS OF GOD, ELOHIM'S ATTRIBUTES, HIS POTENTIALS THAT ARE NOW REALIZED. HE WAS POTENTIALLY ME. NOW HE ACTUALLY BECAME ME BECAUSE NOW HE CAME INTO MY SOUL. AND THE HOLY GHOST IS GOD IN HUMAN FLESH MADE MANIFEST. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS AN ATTRIBUTE THAT ONCE WAS IN GOD. &gt;&gt; I wasn't in this form. I WAS IN ATTRIBUTE FORM, BUT I WAS IN THE LOGOS. &gt;&gt; YOU WERE IN THE LOGOS. THAT'S WHY SONS OF GOD WERE CALLED THE STARS OF THE MORNING. THEY WERE SHOUTING [screaming] FOR JOY &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY WERE IN THE LOGOS. BUT NOW THEY'VE STEPPED INTO FLESH. &gt;&gt; WHAT AM I LOOKING AT? SONS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHAT ARE SONS OF GOD? The eternal father made manifest in the flesh. &gt;&gt; That's what we read. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the son of God because HE WAS THE ETERNAL ONE MADE MANIFEST IN THE flesh and HE GAINED THE TITLE OF SON. &gt;&gt; IT SAYS EVEN SO WE ARE HIS ETERNAL THOUGHTS AND NOW WE'RE MADE MANIFEST AND WE ARE CALLED SONS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; WHAT'S THE SON of God? It's a thought. &gt;&gt; An eternal thought made manifest. Amen. &gt;&gt; Beloved, now are we &gt;&gt; the sons OF GOD. &gt;&gt; NOW [screaming] ARE WE THE SONS OF GOD, &gt;&gt; NOT TOMORROW. NOW ARE WE THE SONS OF GOD. YOU COME FROM GOD. YOU GO BACK TO GOD. AND IN THE EVENING TIME, YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO WHERE YOU CAME FROM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's why says we look at the shadows of the evening time, right? And what does the evening time tell us? It's homegoing time. Amen. &gt;&gt; We all get up in the morning. We all go to work. Some go to school. And when the day is over, where do you go? &gt;&gt; Home. &gt;&gt; You don't you don't need to be told &gt;&gt; go home. &gt;&gt; The evening time tells you it's time TO GO HOME. &gt;&gt; AND THEN YOU GO HOME. WHERE DO YOU GO? WHERE YOU LEFT IN THE MORNING? &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T LEAVE YOUR HOUSE AND THEN GO BACK TO SOMEBODY ELSE'S HOUSE. YOU GO BACK TO WHERE YOU CAME FROM BECAUSE YOUR ORIGIN IS YOUR DESTINATION. &gt;&gt; WHERE YOU CAME FROM IS WHERE YOU GO BACK TO. &gt;&gt; JESUS TOLD US, I COME FROM GOD. I GO BACK TO GOD. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, HE'S SAYING, I WAS [screaming] AN ATTRIBUTE IN THE LOGOS AND I'M RETURNING BACK IN LOGOS FORM. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE. YOU COME FROM GOD. YOU GO BACK TO GOD. NOW, YOU ARE THE SONS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; If the logos is your origin, The Lord Ghost is your destination. &gt;&gt; YOU CANNOT COME FROM GOD AND END UP SOMEWHERE [screaming] ELSE. IF YOU COME FROM GOD, AS SURE AS GOD IS GOD, THERE'S A RAPTURE FOR YOU CUZ YOU GOT TO GO BACK WHERE YOU COME FROM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And the devil thinks he can step in between &gt;&gt; and then change your destination. &gt;&gt; The only way to change where you're going is to change where you come from. Amen. &gt;&gt; The DNA test, &gt;&gt; the paternity test &gt;&gt; is to find the genes in the father &gt;&gt; that matches the gene in the son. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THERE'S A MATCH IN THOSE GENES, WE SAY WE'RE 99.9%. THIS MAN IS THE FATHER. &gt;&gt; AND JESUS SAID THE THE PHARISEES SAYS, "OUR FATHER ABRAHAM." AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. Let me give you a DNA test. Let me take a sample here. I want to do a DNA test." And Jesus took their sample and did a DNA test. AND IT SAYS, "YOU OF YOUR FATHER, THE DEVIL." &gt;&gt; Because if YOU KNEW ABRAHAM, YOU WOULD KNOW ME BECAUSE ABRAHAM SAW MY DAY. ABRAHAM WAS AN ATTRIBUTE in me and our jeans match. IF YOU ARE HIS GENE, YOU WILL MATCH WITH ME. &gt;&gt; BUT I see you come from the devil. He's your father and you're DOING HIS WORKS, BUT YOU DON'T COME FROM THE DEVIL BECAUSE YOUR DNA MATCHES GOD'S DNA. &gt;&gt; WHAT'S THE PATERNITY TEST? &gt;&gt; HOW DO you know who's your father? &gt;&gt; Receiving the word for your day. &gt;&gt; WHY DID GOD SEND A PROPHET? HE WANTED TO GATHER A BRIDE. AND THE BRIDE IS MADE of sons of God attributes. So to gather a bride, you have to find sons and daughters, right? Because they formed THE BRIDE. SO GOD GAVE BROTHER A MESSAGE. The opening of the seals is God's DNA test. &gt;&gt; And the prophet BECAME TO PREACH THE OPENING OF the word to you and administer to you a DNA test. AND WHEN YOU HEARD THE WORD, WHEN YOU HEARD THE WORD, IT TOOK A SAMPLE OF YOUR GENE. AND THEN YOU FIND YOURSELF IN THE WORLD AND THEN YOU SAW YOUR NAME. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU SAW YOUR NAME, YOU RECOGNIZE GOD IS MY FATHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY OF YOU BELIEVE the message? &gt;&gt; How many you believe the message? Not just say it. BELIEVE IT. &gt;&gt; IT'S BEEN REVEALED TO YOU TO BE THE TRUTH OF GOD THAT I CAN SAY ON THE AUTHORITY OF THE WORD, YOUR NAME IS IN THIS BOOK. THAT'S WHY YOU BELIEVE IT CUZ YOU HEARD [screaming] YOUR NAME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You know when you walk walked to the airport. This happened to me once. &gt;&gt; I was very late. I was flying somewhere and then I heard passenger Jean man. I say please report to the counter promptly for departure. Passenger. Passenger Jean. As soon as I heard my name, I started running. &gt;&gt; Everybody else was walking. I was running because there was a destination I was being called to. &gt;&gt; Because I heard my name being called. Those who did not hear the name did not run with me. &gt;&gt; I was the ONLY ONE WHO RAN there and ask ME, "ARE YOU JOHN?" "YES. WHERE'S YOUR IDENTIFICATION? HERE'S MY ID." OKAY, YOU ARE WHAT YOU HEARD. [screaming] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I PROVE THAT I AM WHAT I HEARD. I AM THE NAME THAT WAS CALLED AND I HAD AN IDENTIFICATION TO PROVE IT. THAT'S THE REASON WHY YOU BELIEVE AND OTHERS DON'T BELIEVE BECAUSE YOU HEARD YOUR NAME. &gt;&gt; IT WAS CALLING YOUR NAME. MARK, REBECCA, JOHN, [screaming] DANIEL, EMMANUEL, WHOEVER YOUR NAME IS, IT CALL YOUR NAME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that's the proof &gt;&gt; that you have been quickened. &gt;&gt; What's a new birth? seeing the word for your day. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT BORN AGAIN UNLESS YOU SEE IT. &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE OF THE ONCE YOU RECOGNIZE THE WORD OF YOUR DAY, YOU HAVE BEEN QUICKENED BY GOD HIMSELF AND GOD HAS CLAIMED YOU AS HIS SON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; So this also proves then your origin &gt;&gt; because if it proves who you are, it proves where you come from. &gt;&gt; And if it proves where you come from, it proves where you're going. Right? &gt;&gt; Because predestination says for knowledge, right? For knowledge looks back and because he knows he knows the end from the beginning. Therefore, he predestinates. &gt;&gt; So your predestination or your destination that's set before pre destination is to set your destination before. &gt;&gt; YOUR PREDESTINATION IS BASED ON FORNOWLEDGE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD KNEW &gt;&gt; from the beginning that when he comes in THE FLESH AND HE DIES FOR YOU, YOU will believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE SENDS A MESSAGE TO BRING YOU BACK TO WHAT ADAM LOST, YOU WILL BELIEVE IT. &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT IN HIS FORN KNOWLEDGE, HE TOOK YOUR NAME AND WROTE IT IN THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND HE MADE SURE THAT HE SET YOUR DESTINATION &gt;&gt; like a GPS. Where are you going? I'm going to the airport. &gt;&gt; Destination set. &gt;&gt; START. &gt;&gt; YES, I'M WALKING. Turn left. You go left. Turn right. You turn right. KEEP GOING FOR 2 KM. KEEP GOING. TURN RIGHT. YOUR DESTINATION WAS SET BEFORE THE TRIP BEGAN. &gt;&gt; Sons of God ARE LED BY THE spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Right. Where is THE SPIRIT LEADING YOU? TO THE DESTINATION THAT WAS SENT WHEN YOU WERE PREDESTINATED. &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD PUT YOUR NAME IN THE BOOK AND SAID YOUR DESTINATION is a NEW HEAVEN, THE HOLY SPIRIT CAME TO YOU TO MAKE SURE &gt;&gt; YOU WILL END UP. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. &gt;&gt; THE HOLY SPIRIT WAS SENT TO MAKE SURE &gt;&gt; YOU REACH THE DESTINATION. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE HOLY GHOST WAS SENT FOR. THE HOLY GHOST GOES BACK IN THE BOOK OF LIFE AND LOOKS AT THE NAMES AND THEN HE FINDS YOUR NAME AND COMES TO YOU AND SAY I'M RESPONSIBLE &gt;&gt; to take you to your destination. [cheering] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAY ONLY THOSE FILLED WITH THE HOLY Ghost will make it in the RAPTURE BECAUSE THE HOLY GHOST IS GOD'S GPS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT WAS COORDINATED BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE EARTH WITH ETERNITY AS YOUR DESTINATION. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND THIS GPS IS NOT LIKE MAN'S GPS. &gt;&gt; When you can go ahead and stop and change the destination. &gt;&gt; This GPS, IF YOU TRY THE DESTINATION, IT SAYS permission denied. You know, but I DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE AIRPORT ANYMORE. I WANT TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. PERMISSION DENIED. &gt;&gt; THIS CAR HAS BEEN LOCKED. THE DESTINATION HAS BEEN FIXED. YOU CAN ONLY GET OUT WHEN YOU GET THERE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, I FEEL SO GOOD THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; I REJOICE [screaming] THIS MORNING. I CAN SAY LIKE JESUS, FATHER, I THANK YOU &gt;&gt; FOR YOU'VE HIDDEN THESE THINGS TO THE WISE AND THE PRUDENT, BUT YOU'RE MAKING THEM KNOWN UNTO US. &gt;&gt; I THANK YOU, FATHER, FOR MY DESOLATION. HE SAID, &gt;&gt; "WINE GLAD MORNING. WHEN THIS LIFE IS OVER, I WILL FLY AWAY." [cheering] &gt;&gt; I like THAT WE'RE SAYING, "I CAN'T DIE." &gt;&gt; NOT I WON'T. I CAN'T. &gt;&gt; I CAN'T DIE. &gt;&gt; It's literally impossible. Father, &gt;&gt; I HAVE KEPT ALL that you've given me &gt;&gt; except Judas, &gt;&gt; the son of predition. &gt;&gt; Right? That's the ASSURANCE THAT JESUS WILL NOT LOSE ANY &gt;&gt; any &gt;&gt; all that the father has given me will &gt;&gt; come &gt;&gt; and no man can pluck them out of my And I was with a brother. We were witnessing to a group of people for several weeks and he was getting very frustrated that how we're spending all this time with them and they still don't believe. He's like he's like they're not sincere. [laughter] If they're sincere, they will see it by now. &gt;&gt; I told him, "Brother, calm down." I said, "If they're sons, [snorts] no man can want them more than God." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; No man. I said, "Don't think that you're so zealous to want to see them say that your zeal is greater than God's zeal." I said, "If God can be patient, so can we." &gt;&gt; We don't save. WE DON'T QUICKEN. GOD IS THE ONE WHO DOESN'T. &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES WE'RE LIKE, "OH, THEY'RE UNBELIEVERS. THE SERPENT SEED CAREFUL." &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE NOT BEEN CALLED TO QUICKEN SEEDS. &gt;&gt; ONLY GOD CAN QUICKEN SEEDS. AND AS MANY AS ARE CALLED, THEY ARE THE SONS OF GOD. AND THEY WILL BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT, NOT BECAUSE YOU DID IT BECAUSE GOD WILL NOT LOSE ONE. &gt;&gt; PARENTS WITH BACKSLIDED CHILDREN, GOD WILL NOT LOSE ONE. [screaming] &gt;&gt; THAT'S MY PEACE. THAT'S MY ASSURANCE. LORD, IF THEY'RE YOURS, YOU WILL NOT LOSE ANY. &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; I CAN REST assured &gt;&gt; because for me there are things I was saying this brother Ray once. There are things that God is supposed to worry about. Let me just put put it that way. &gt;&gt; Though he doesn't worry, but there are things he's supposed to worry about, not me. &gt;&gt; And there are things that I'm supposed to worry about. But too often we begin to worry about the things that fall under God's umbrella. &gt;&gt; We have a part to play. God has a part to play. &gt;&gt; When God gave me his word, right, he gave me a reason to expect something, right? Because the word is what sets expectation. If I tell you, which I believe brother Moses did, he announced brother John is coming. I believe he did, right? &gt;&gt; He told you he's coming to preach here, right? So then his word gave you a reason to expect me. &gt;&gt; Okay? You did not come up with an expectation of your own. You didn't just expect this sign that brother John is going to be here. No, that expectation was birthed by the word that you heard. &gt;&gt; So God is responsible for the things that I expect because of the word that he sent. &gt;&gt; So my responsibility is to believe what he says &gt;&gt; and that's where it ends. &gt;&gt; His responsibility is to ensure that his word does not fall to the ground &gt;&gt; because it will not return to him void. SO HE HAS TO make sure that the things he has caused me to believe. &gt;&gt; These are NOT THE THINGS THAT I PER ADVENTURE DECIDED I WANTED TO BELIEVE. NO, THESE ARE THINGS THAT HE CAUSED ME TO BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM EXPECTED TO BE A FATHER OF NATIONS BECAUSE GOD told him that. &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM WAS AN IDOL WORSHIPPER. HE DID NOT THINK ABOUT IT. GOD CALLED him to handle expectation. RIGHT? SO THAT GOD WAS RESPONSIBLE TO SEE TO IT THAT WHAT HE SAID TO ABRAHAM WILL COME TO PASS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE ASSURANCE WE HAVE IN THE WORD THAT it does not falter. &gt;&gt; If one thing fells to the ground, God has broken my trust. &gt;&gt; Because the next time he tells me something, &gt;&gt; how do I know for sure? &gt;&gt; This is why the word of God is not something that comes from God. The word of God is God himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Because he swears by himself. God when he gives you his word, he gives you himself. He's pledging that if my word fails, then I fail. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's what he's saying. So rest assured, the word of God will not fail. The things that God has said concerning you will not fail. &gt;&gt; The things that he has said concerning your family will not fail. AND IF YOUR CHILDREN ARE SEEDS, THEY'RE A SEED. IF YOUR MOM IS SEED, SHE is seed. IF YOUR DAD IS SEED, ALL SEEDS WILL be quickened. &gt;&gt; They can be the vilest of vilest, the filthiest, they will be quickened. &gt;&gt; Brother, I'm saying the message of grace, the sovereign grace can only be given by a sovereign one. &gt;&gt; And he says, what is sovereign grace? He says it's grace that does whatever it wants to. You can go read it in message of grace. Sovereign grace is what? grace that does whatever it wants to mean that you cannot say well God you can't do that says who I can do whatever I want as a matter of fact we we know the principles right that you you you have to be circumcised the Jews right and then you have to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and then you'll receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Acts 238 right that's what Peter preached and then people put that in the box they said this is how you get the Holy Ghost If you're not baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and if you're not a Jew, you're not going to get the Holy Ghost. Then God comes to Peter in a vision and he sees all these creeping creatures. He says, "Rise up, kill and eat." Peter says, "No, Lord, you know me. I'm a Jew. No unclean things can come in my mouth. I I can't do this." He says, "Do not call unclean &gt;&gt; while God has sanctified." &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, what what a vision your God is portraying to Peter. What he's thinking is Peter's thinking is that the Gentiles are unclean &gt;&gt; and then salvation belongs to the Jews. That's what he's thinking. And God is says, "Uh-uh, don't call those Gentiles unclean because I can sanctify them." As a MATTER OF FACT, RISE UP. &gt;&gt; FOLLOW THIS MAN. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU TO A MAN CALLED CORNELIUS. GO THERE. &gt;&gt; OKAY. &gt;&gt; PETER, IS PETER HERE? YEAH, HE'S HERE. PETER, COME. OKAY. WE WERE SENT. Let's go. They go, they get to Cornelius house and Cornelius says, I was praying and then angel came to me and said, Cornelius, God has heard your prayers, &gt;&gt; but now send a man to this house. You find a man called Simon Peter. Bring him to you and he'll tell you what to do. &gt;&gt; Imagine God sending an angel down with a message to Cornelius to go say, "Go get another man." &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, man is the expression of God, not angel. It's man. An angel could not come and give Cornelius the Holy Ghost. He couldn't do it. He could only come WITH A MESSAGE. SAYS, "CORNELIUS, I HAVE COME BECAUSE GOD HAS HEARD YOUR PRAYER, BUT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED ANOTHER MAN." [screaming] &gt;&gt; Peter comes and begins to preach a word. Right? And then THE BIBLE SAYS, "WHILE PETER YET SPAKE THOSE WORDS, &gt;&gt; FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE UPPER ROOM, THE HOLY GHOST IS NOW GOING TO FALL ON PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT EVEN BAPTIZED, &gt;&gt; that are not even circumcised. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOT EVEN A scripture for them." &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE SCRIPTURE that Peter GAVE WAS TO BE BAPTIZED FIRST, THEN YOU WILL GET THE HOLY GHOST. THESE ONES GET THE HOLY GHOST FIRST, THEN THEY GET BAPTIZED. &gt;&gt; WOW. &gt;&gt; What's that? Sovereign grace. &gt;&gt; It's grace THAT CAN DO WHATEVER IT WANTS TO. &gt;&gt; IF GOD WANTS TO FILL SOMEBODY WITH THE HOLY GHOST NOW, HE WILL FILL THEM WITH THE HOLY GHOST NOW. &gt;&gt; AND THEN YOU CAN SAY, "WHY? THEY DON'T EVEN COME TO CHURCH. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN CHURCH." HE CAN FILL THEM ANYWAYS &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE CAN DO WHATEVER HE WANTS TO. &gt;&gt; What happened in Hides home? Tell me &gt;&gt; those boys &gt;&gt; last I checked they were laughing &gt;&gt; they were scoffers they were mocking &gt;&gt; God came in that room sister had started crying while the other sister was crying the presence of God says power came in that room that that room almost fell apart &gt;&gt; and those boys are laughing &gt;&gt; at the presence of God &gt;&gt; and they're laughing and then Hadira says it's nothing but the truth Yeah. &gt;&gt; And God says, "Give her whatever she wants." &gt;&gt; Now, God didn't give any parameters to he says whatever she wants. He's true to his word. &gt;&gt; Everybody said, "I want the salvation of my two children." God came to two boys. They were mockers, scoffers, &gt;&gt; laughing at God without them repenting, &gt;&gt; without them apologizing, without them thinking about what they've done wrong, without them going to church, without them going to an altar call, without anybody LAYING HANDS ON THEM AND FILL THEM WITH THE HOLY GHOST THEN AND THEN. &gt;&gt; SOVEREIGN GRACE CAN DO WHATEVER IT WANTS TO. GOD CAN FEEL WHOEVER, WHENEVER, HOWEVER, WHEREVER. &gt;&gt; HE CAN FEEL YOU IN CHURCH. HE CAN FEEL YOU AT HOME. HE CAN FEEL YOU AT WORK. HE CAN FEEL YOU IN THE BAR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SOVEREIGN. &gt;&gt; But this tells me then had it right. Why should you really ask? I want the attributes that laid in God &gt;&gt; that were not made manifest &gt;&gt; to be quickened in my sons. That's what she really asked. WHAT DO YOU WANT, SISTER? I WANT TWO NAMES IN THE BOOK TO BE CALLED. &gt;&gt; AND GOD CALLED [screaming] THOSE NAMES AND THEY WERE QUICKENED. &gt;&gt; DO YOU WANT TO PRAY FOR SOMEBODY? THAT'S HOW YOU PRAY. LORD, I WANT THE NAME. IF THEIR NAMES ARE IN THE BOOK, I [screaming] WANT THE HOLY GHOST TO GO BY AND QUICKEN THOSE NAMES THAT ARE IN THE BOOK. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Because those names are the eternal one made manifest IN THE FLESH. GOD'S POTENTIALS. He had the potential to become you and I. &gt;&gt; And now he is you and I. &gt;&gt; And the saddest story of the Bible, Adam and Eve being kicked out. Now I've been restored. &gt;&gt; It started with Adam and Eve. It ends with Adam and Eve. &gt;&gt; Because the last chapter of the Bible is the spirit and the bride. Say &gt;&gt; come. &gt;&gt; That's it. And there's been an invitation said to come to the wedding supper of the lamb. COME. I'LL SHOW YOU THE BRIDE. THE WIFE'S LAMB. THE LAMB'S WIFE. WHO AM I PREACHING TO? THE BRIDE. THE LAMB'S WIFE. [cheering] &gt;&gt; THE PURPOSE THAT GOD HAD IN HIMSELF. BROTHER SAID THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF GOD IS TO GET A BREAD OF HIS OWN CHOOSING. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Can I take two minutes? &gt;&gt; Two minutes to expound. Let's start here. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE HEART PURPOSE OF God is not just to get a bride, &gt;&gt; but it's to get a bride of his own choosing. &gt;&gt; You can read that in the church book. I'm not making this up. If you want to put it on the screen somewhere, you can find it. Is to choose is to pick up a bride of his own choosing. &gt;&gt; You know what that means? That means to me that the bride that Christ ends up with You can Do you want Do you want the quote? I can find it for you if you want. Okay, I see the bird looking for you. Type on choosing and you'll find it. on choosing. Hey, let's just read it together. Two O's. Yeah. Search. No, you're searching the title. So, you want to search the quotes. There you go. On choosing. Okay. Do exact search exact phrase this. Yeah. Uh, keep scroll down. Try to find in the church's book and you'll find it somewhere there. It's in this minor churches book I think. Uh I think you passed it. I think I saw it somewhere. Okay, I'll let you search for it on choosing and you can actually add a bride if you want another keyword bride on choosing but then you have to remove the exact search and I want to find this code for you because I have it here. It'll be good to read it all together. &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay. Smina churches. I got it for you. It's uh Yeah. Sme churches. You can get it in there. &gt;&gt; Did you find it? &gt;&gt; Okay. It says this this choosing of the bride was purpose in himself. Ephesians 1 verse 9 and in Romans it says and in Romans 9:11 it says that the purpose of God according to election might stand. You can't read it any other way. &gt;&gt; You have it. There you go. You can't read it any other way. THE HEART PURPOSE, THE ETERNAL PURPOSE OF GOD WAS TO TAKE a bride of his capital O W N his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and being eternal was decreed before the foundational world. Okay. He says you cannot read it any other way. Which means that the bride that God has in this last days was not a bride that was given to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Was not a bride that he ended up with. &gt;&gt; WAS NOT A BRIDE THAT A RESULT OF SOMEBODY giving him THE BRIDE. THE BRIDE THAT HE ENDS UP WITH WAS NOT A A mistake or per chance or per adventure or THE FATHER SAYING, "HERE'S YOUR BRIDE. GO MARRY HER." NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. THE BRIDE THAT GOD HAS IN HIS LAST DAYS IS A BRIDE WHO IS THE result of a deliberate choice. &gt;&gt; You can't READ IT ANY OTHER WAY. WHICH MEANS IF YOU ARE THE BRIDE, YOU'RE NOT ACCIDENTALLY THE BRIDE. YOU DID NOT JUST ENDED UP IN THE BRIDE. YOU DO NOT HAPPEN TO BE THE BRIDE. SOMEBODY PUT YOU IN THE BREAD. &gt;&gt; And the person WHO PUT YOU THERE CHOSE YOU. &gt;&gt; Handpicked you. &gt;&gt; DELIBERATE CHOICE. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE THE BRIDE OF HIS OWN CHOOSING. IT WASN'T ME MINI ME ANYWAY. IT WASN'T like you you maybe not you, you maybe not you. No. God says I want you and you and you and you AND YOU AND HE PICKED YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE CHOSE YOU FOR HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE THE CHOICE OF GOD &gt;&gt; according to the purpose of election. &gt;&gt; I love the word the election of grace because election means that there was a vote. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; When there's an election, it means there there are candidates &gt;&gt; and then the people go and then they choose who won. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; One and one the people have spoken the person that was chosen is elected. Right? So the election of grace means that there is many people on the earth and God held an election and grace chose who he [snorts] wanted. &gt;&gt; Now unlike human elections where it's based on a campaign where you have to sell yourself so you win. &gt;&gt; This election is based on grace &gt;&gt; where you did not have to do anything. &gt;&gt; You did not convince God to choose you. YOU ARE NOT SO GOOD THAT GOD CHOSE YOU. NO, GRACE CAME AND HELD AN ELECTION and then grace chose you. &gt;&gt; You won &gt;&gt; and then you makes it you make IT IN THE BRIDE BECAUSE YOU ARE HIS OWN CHOOSING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil minimize who you are &gt;&gt; and don't let the devil tell you that you are less than what you are. &gt;&gt; Humility is not refusing what God is calling you to be because you you're too humble. Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; It's not, oh, I'm so humble. I don't want to say I'm perfect. Nobody's perfect. &gt;&gt; If God calls you perfect, &gt;&gt; you are. &gt;&gt; Humility is not like I'm not I'm not worthy. If God calls you worthy, you are. You know, brother says you're worthy. &gt;&gt; You know, he says that and it says that in the Hebrew worthy means a scale. It means that you put somebody on the balance and then God put Jesus on the balance and the balance went like that, right? And then he put you on the other side and you went like this and then you and Christ match. That's what worthy means. You are both worthy. You're equal. Means that you are what completes him. &gt;&gt; Without you, he could not be complete. And the one who was self-existing, who dwelt alone, is never going back to that form again. &gt;&gt; Ever. &gt;&gt; Once sin is over and we're back into eternity, there's going to be nobody sick that needs healing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's going to be nobody lost that needs salvation. &gt;&gt; All these attributes are going back to dormant again. because they're all being expressed for a purpose and that purpose is achieved. But you know what remains? Husband and wife &gt;&gt; in him. He wanted to be a husband &gt;&gt; and he wanted to have a wife. Those are the two things that remain. And when you reign with him is husband and wife. It's not redeemer and loss and healer and no those attributes HAVE DONE THE WORK. BUT GOD IS YOUR HUSBAND. THAT'S WHY he is love is based on love. The message of the hour is the expression of God's love to us. &gt;&gt; It's the fullness of love that's been restored back to the church. What is the capstone? &gt;&gt; Love, &gt;&gt; right? Okay. Then you mean to tell me that in all the other church ages, they did not have love. That's not what it means, right? &gt;&gt; They had love because love is the Holy Spirit, right? But what the capsule means is that in this last days, it's the fullness of God's love &gt;&gt; that's been expressed to us. And how did God express his love to us? By telling us his thoughts. There's no more secrets between you and I and him. He tells us all his secrets. And that's how he shows us that we are his bride. &gt;&gt; He whispers secrets that the churches know nothing about. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I hope something was said &gt;&gt; this morning that was a blessing to you. The song may come. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I am so thankful for the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the message came and told me who I am. &gt;&gt; Religion and churches lied to me. They portrayed God to be somebody that he was not. &gt;&gt; And God came and set the record straight. He says, "I want you to forget this way of thinking. What they told you about me is not true. I am not three. I am one. &gt;&gt; I am not all wrath. I am love. I'm not judgment. I am mercy. I am peace. I am grace. He told me how to really think about him. And then he tells me that this whole Bible really is about me. The story of redemption is about you &gt;&gt; and I. &gt;&gt; God's purpose was to dwell with men. &gt;&gt; That's why the book of Revelation says God's tabernacle is with men. God wanted to dwell in human flesh and the Holy Spirit paved the way for that to happen because now your soul has been washed and sanctified that the Holy Spirit himself can dwell in you [music] and then he can mature you to be a son of God. As many as received him to them [music] gave you power to become the sons of God which is why we are. So walk out of this place knowing who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Knowing that your life is in God's [music] hands, knowing that whatever the devil does in your life is not his own doing. is God allowed? And stop giving the devil any time to think about the things he's doing. It's not him. It's God. Your relationship and your dealings are only with God. You don't even worry about the devil. The devil is nothing. You are everything to God. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Are you wanting to close, brother? [applause] Whoever I works. Whoever wants to come and close. [music] Glorious glory [music and singing] throne. [music] My life is no longer mine. I'm a prisoner of love divine. And now I live to praise his name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Who am I, Lord? Who am I? &gt;&gt; I can [music and singing] see now who I am. A part of [music] my Savior, [singing] a part of his word. It's a revelation of who I am. On Calary, [singing] he died to redeem his lost bride. The King of Kings became my Savior. This is first mystery of love expressed to me that Christ and I might be made one. Who am I, Lord? Who I am. I can see [music and singing] now who I am. I am. I'm a part of my savior, [singing] a part of his word. It's a reation of who I am. &gt;&gt; My what a revelation we have received. &gt;&gt; Praise God for the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; How many believe it? Amen. &gt;&gt; And God is revealing and manifesting his attributes. &gt;&gt; Now we are the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Now we are. Oh, how we enjoyed it. &gt;&gt; Oh, how we revel in this revelation. &gt;&gt; Say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can you SAY PRAISE THE LORD? PRAISE THE LORD FOR THIS WORD THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED IN THIS END TIME. GOD IS REAL. HIS POWER IS REAL. THE HOLY GHOST IS HERE THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; Praise his wonderful name. He is wonderful.

Praise [singing] his [music] name. My heart sings today. Sings for joy in gladness. Jesus [music and singing] saves, satisfies, vanishes my sadness. Guilt is gone. Peace is mine. Peace to you like a river. Jesus is so wonderful and mighty [music and singing] to deliver. Wonderful, wonderful. [singing and music] Jesus is to be the counselor, the prince of peace, the mighty guide. [singing and music] saving me, keeping me from all sin and shame. Wonderful is my redeemer. Praise [singing] his neighbor's dream. Living there with my Lord in a holy union day by day all holy sweet commun. [singing] Oh, what strange grace has wrought in my lowly [music] station since my soul has received salvation. Wonderful wonderful Jesus is to me prince of peace. Mighty God is he. &gt;&gt; OH, HE'S A MIGHTY GOD. HE'S A MIGHTY GOD UNVEILED BEFORE US. HALLELUJAH. Wonderful is my redeemer. [singing and music] Praise his name. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, LET'S PRAISE THE LORD THIS MORNING. HALLELUJAH. Raise your hand and SAY, "THANK YOU, LORD, [screaming] THAT I'M PART OF YOU, LORD. I'M PART OF YOUR THOUGHTS. I'M PART OF YOUR WORD." PRAISE your name, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Lord, we thank you this morning. Oh, for the WORD OF GOD THAT WE HAVE HEARD, LORD. WE BELIEVE IT WITH ALL OF OUR HEARTS, LORD. Every part of it, Lord Jesus. Your thoughts were dormant one time, but Lord, here we are. Oh, God. We are manifesting you in the flesh. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Praise your wonderful name. Hallelujah. Praise God. He's so wonderful. my brother and your my sister. Amen. Let's bow our head just for one moment. I think this is a time. Amen. If you are a seed of God, you'll respond to the word of God this morning. If there's somebody here this morning that needs prayer and say, "Lord, I'm coming back to you. I've been I've gone wayward. Lord, I won't want to come back to you. Lord, would you raise your hand this morning? Is there somebody here that was touched this morning? You are seed AND YOU ARE COMING BACK to Jesus Christ this morning. This word was not spoken in vain. It was spoken for a purpose. It was spoken to the seed of God. If you have been touched this morning and you want to be filled with the Holy Spirit, you want the life of God to come into your life because without that life, you're not going. You need the life. You need the Holy Spirit in your life. And may the Lord just come and quicken that word in you. Is there somebody here this morning? Let's just all pray together. Father in heaven, we're so grateful this morning for your precious word. You're the great Elohim. Yes, you always were and you always will be the great Elohim. But Lord Jesus, you become Emmanuel, God with us. And God is with us here this morning in the form of the Holy Spirit. You are here. You Lord, you said you would come and you have fulfilled your promise even this morning. We feel you in our heart. It's not by feeling, BUT WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE WITHIN US, LORD. And we can know by the fruits that we bear by by believing the word of the hour, Lord. How precious this word is to us. Blessed be the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Glory to thy wonderful name. Glory to thy name, Lord. That you are our savior. You're our provider. You're Jehovah Gyra. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah to the name of Jesus. We worship you here this morning. Oh God, we want that relationship to be a closer relationship in our life. Lord, you want us to have that bride relationship, that husband and bride re wife relationship. We pray, oh God, in Jesus' name. Hallelujah. Amen. Isn't it too bad we've come to a close of the service? I could have heard some more. Amen. That's what I've been preaching about all these years, right? Amen. How many can say that? That happened here just in a different way. But we have believed it. Amen. This word is is wonderful. Praises your wonderful name, Jesus. Hallelujah. Amen. We want to give some time to our brother to give his testimony. I think that's [music] what brother Moses was saying. Is that is are you going to give your testimony yet? Yeah, that's what I'm hearing, too. [laughter] Amen. I was kind of surprised to be called up here this this morning, but what did you want to say? I think it was after service for the youth. &gt;&gt; So if anyone would like to stay in here that they they're welcome to. But it's &gt;&gt; Yeah. This was for the youth, but I want to be here. I want to be part of those the youth. How many want to hear that that testimony? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to hear this testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'M PART OF THE YOUTH. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. POTENTIALLY I'M PART OF THE YOUTH. &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE LIFE OF GOD IS IN ME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Praise God. So, we're going to close it. Amen. And then, brother, you could just come here and give your testimony. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Bless the people, Lord, and go with us. Those that want to go in the name of Jesus, Lord, may they go and be blessed. And may we word of God with us. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. And amen. You may be seated. Come, brother. Amen. be free to close the service. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to share this quickly for 15 minutes, I think. I'm going to ask brother Ray to sing one more song for me that I really want to hear. Is that okay? After. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So, I'll do you want to do this now or after? Oh, let's do after at the end so we can rejoice and go. Uh, well, first I'd like to say thank you again for having me here today. This is it's one of those days I'm not going to forget. uh you really had a good time here. You're a wonderful church. You love the word and you can always tell the quality of the church by how the Holy Spirit will use the gift. &gt;&gt; Uh a lot of things that were said today were were coming because you're pulling those things. So, &gt;&gt; we really thank God for that and trust this is not the last time I'm going to be here. &gt;&gt; Hope to see you again someday. &gt;&gt; Um I just gave my my testimony. I was born in well, we say the message, but I don't believe you're born in the message until you're born again. &gt;&gt; So, I would say I was born in the message church. They say that way. My my my parents were believers. Uh my dad was a Catholic. My mom was a Protestant and they both came into the message before I was born. Then I was born uh as the first child born in the message. I had three siblings before me. And then I was born in in the Congo. There's the Democratic Republic of Congo and then there is the Republic of Congo. Most people don't know the two different countries but but they are. So I come from the smaller one about uh four million people. That's where I was born and I grew up in the message church. Uh I believe it was around 11 11 years old that I got baptized. I get mad and got baptized. And then around 14 is when the message came by my way as really being more than what mom and dad believed. You know there there's I was I was in a service I remember that service for the rest of my life where the Holy Spirit was moving such a such an incredible way that the way it came to me was this message is the truth. And it wasn't mom and dad believe this. This was this is what I believe. And the joy that filled my heart. I can never explain what it was like because all I could do was cry. Just tears coming the entire service. At the end of the service when we're greeting one another outside, I was just just tears. They asked me why you're crying. I said I'm just so happy. There just something that just settled. It's like this is the truth and I found it. Right. And then uh you know as a teenager I went through my struggles as a teenager and then I went to university in South Africa when I was about 18 years old. Uh that's when I started going the wrong the wrong way. Uh I did not know there was churches there but it was my first time being away from home. And then you know sometimes you go to church and sometimes you don't go to church. And then the less you go to church the more the devil has a hole on you the less you feed on the word. And then I went astray and I ended up in Australia for university. And that's when uh the furthest I've ever been from God was in Australia. And it's not so much in the things that I was doing, but it is more about the the golf that was between me and God that that gap was so so big that the only way I can describe it is that I think I lost even the consciousness of God. Let me put it that way. I live my life as though there was no God. Like I wasn't even thinking what would God do? Is God about what gossip. I did not think about God when I woke up. I did not think about God when I went to bed. It's just there's just like no nothing there. But when you're seed, you're seed, &gt;&gt; right? God will not lose you. And then you can go years and years and years without praying. You don't even know how to pray anymore. That doesn't stop God. &gt;&gt; God will still find you because like I said, he's already in you potentially. So when I was going to school, I was going to school with God. When I came back home, he was there. He was always there even though I was no longer aware of it. Right? When you receive the Holy Ghost, now you become aware that you're a son of God. You always were. But now that awareness is the power that drives you, right? So I remember now I I my life was going very good in university. I was a straight A student. Uh there was a company that came on campus. Uh they wanted to recruit like uh new graduates and then I was one of the ones that were selected. It was going to be in my field and they say, "Okay, you have a couple years left. we want you to finish, but you have a job offer here waiting for you. We'll do all the paperwork for you and everything. I met with the CTO of the company. As far as I was, as far as I was concerned, my life was set. I was going to live in Australia for the rest of my life. That was my plan. Just I'm going to finish. I'm going to get a job in this company. I'm going to become a citizen. I'm just going to live here, live my life here. But that very semester, I just finished my exams. And then I I was heading back back from school, I believe, in the bus. It was a far about 45 minute pass, right? And I used to usually I sit by the window because I just like to look outside. And I sat by the window and I just looking outside and I just closed my eyes and I just fell asleep. And I heard this voice as clear as you hear mine. It said, "Go back home until I tell you what to do." That's what it said. "Return back home until I tell you what to do." And I was very aware that God had spoken to me. So for the first time in I don't know how long So I I found my mom and dad and I say, "I'm coming back home." I said, "Uh, no you're not." I said, "Yes, I am." They said, "That's not going to happen." Like we we worked so hard to send you to university there. We spent so much money. You are going to finish and you're going to stay there. I was like, "It's not going to happen. God told me to come back home." So eventually they let me come back home. And I went back home. At the time, my parents were living in. So that's why I went back. And then my dad said, "Well, you can't stay home. Like you need to finish school. Like what are you doing here? Where do you want to go?" I said, "I don't know." He says, "How about do you go to the UK? There's some good schools there." I said, "No, not the UK." He says, "What do you want to do?" I said, "Stay home until I tell you what to do." Those are my instructions, right? Go home until I tell you what to do. So, I wasn't going to make a plan until God told me what to do. So, I wasn't like serving God by any means or anything. I just obeyed. I obey the commandment. And this is key to my testimony is that I obey the commandment. And when I came back home and I prayed and I said to the Lord, I don't know what you're doing in my life. I don't know who you are and I know that I'm not where I'm supposed to be, but I know one thing. You've asked me to come back here until you tell me what to do and that's what I'm going to do. Then about five months in, my dad said, uh, what about this country or this country? I said no to all the different countries he was mentioning. Then one day he said, what do you think about Canada? And when he say that something just click in my soul says go. I said Canada is a place that's where I'm supposed to be. So we we made the paperwork and did everything. Supernaturally God allowed me to come in a way that it's very uh impossible to explain in the time that we have today. But I went through an agency that chose what city, what university, they chose everything. So I if it was my own choosing I probably would not come to Vancouver because what does Vancouver like I was probably looking at Montreal and Ottawa that's what I was looking at. So they chose uh Vancouver and then they chose Saf University which is key to what everything I'm about to share today because they were the one who chose that. It was not me. So I came to Vancouver. I did not even know there was a message church in Vancouver. Uh a brother picked me up from the airport and he let me stay with him for a couple days and says I'm going to church on Sunday. would like to come. Oh, there's a church here. Say, yeah, this church is brother Ed Bisco. Then I remember hearing my brother Ed Bisco when I was a kid. Like, oh, I would love to come. So then we went to church and brother Ed preached that service. And then it just felt like I was where I was supposed to be. It just felt like, you know, sometimes when God does something, you don't understand it, but you aware that some God is doing something. I mean, I know what I'm talking about. As Christians, you you have that sense like God is God is doing something. I'm not quite sure what. And that's what it was for me. I knew that God was doing something in me being there. And then I'll come to church and I'll disappear for a few months and I come to church and I disappear for a few weeks and I come to church. There's always a desire to, you know, then the desire started growing to serve God again. I was like, I'm not so sure. Like my fear was what if I come back to church and I started serving God again and then I backslide again. Like that was my fear. I was like, well, do I really want to do this? Like I've I've done alter calls. I've been to the altar. I've cried a little bit. Young people know what I'm talking about, right? You go to the altar, you cry, and you're like, "Okay, I'm changed now." You go home, everything is good for what? For one week, for a month, and then you're back square one again. Like, you get so discouraged. And then you try again. And then you try again, right? At that point, I was tired. I'm like, I'm not going to do this again. I'm I'm done. So, one day, Wednesday night, which I I never came to church Wednesdays, but that day I decided to just show up on a Wednesday night. Brother Tom Ray, as a pastor, was was speaking and he started was kept in his peace. And in his in his opening comments, he said, "Peace is not the absence of trouble." He says, "Peace is the presence of God." And those words really grip me. It's not the absence of trouble. It's the presence of God. In the midst of all troubles, you can see our peace. And it wasn't by any, it wasn't like a spectacular deep call it deep service where the church is going, "Hey, man. Glory to God." It was a very downto-earth service, but it ministered so much to me. And the the best way I can explain it is that God put before me the best peace salesman that there was on the face of the earth. Like if you're trying to buy peace, he was a guy to hear. He preached peace so powerfully that the only thing I want is that that's what I want. What you're talking about, yes, that's what I want. There's no doubt in my mind that is what I want. He did s the Holy Spirit through him just sold peace to me in a way that I could not reject it. like there was like no way. I was willing to pay whatever price it was to get that. So I met him at the end of the service and we're in his office. We were talking and and just told me like I just I just want God again. I just want God again in my life. And I was emotional and I was praying and he says, "Do you want to get baptized?" I said, "I was already baptized but I would like to get re baptized. I would like to start again." He says, "Do you want to get baptized this Sunday?" I said, "Yes, I would like to get baptized this Sunday." And then but I said but before I do it brother Tom I said how would I know that this time like something will sink in for good that I'm not going to backslide again I'm not going to go back to what I used to be this time I want something sure so give me an assurance because I don't want to do this just for doing it again. And he said he took his Bible and he said, "What better assurance do you need than the word?" And that was it for me. Like what how what do you what do you say to that? Right? What more assurance do you need than the word? Then I realized he he's right. There's nothing he can give me that's more sure than the word of God. &gt;&gt; And if if I cannot base my life on what the word says, there's nothing that can that can be an absolute to me. So I say, "All right, I I'll do it." He says, "Okay, Sunday morning, wake up a little bit earlier than usual. spend some time alone with God and then come to church. So that Sunday morning, I woke up around five o'clock. I spent some time alone with God in prayer. I opened my Bible and I was reading in Acts chapter 17 where Paul is talking to the king of Gri. He says, "Oh king, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision." Right? And I say these words to God in prayer. I say, "Lord, all I know is that you told me to leave Australia and I left and you led me to Canada and I came." Oh God, like Paul, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision. That's all I said. So, and I know that you're leading me in this as I go into those waters. I want you to fill me with the Holy Spirit. So, I went to church, brother Bisco, preach on the the vision of the commission. And he's opening the scripture. It's Acts 17. Oh, Paul, oh king, I live forever. I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision. Now, God has my attention because I know what I was praying about and I know what God is doing. Now I said something is happening and then I get into the water. Brother Tom comes and baptize me and he says the scripture that God has placed on my heart was the same scripture. Acts 17 I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision. If God has led you all your life he's led you to the waters. He will fill with the Holy Spirit. So now I heard that scripture twice that day. So he he uh prayed for me and he he baptized me and I in his prayer he says Lord I always remember those words. He says, "Lord, like Jeremiah, let there be a fire in his bones." And he says, "Lord, that fire is so real to me, but let it be real to him." And so I appreciate those words, you know, somebody who knows what he's talking about. And then by the grace of God, I went I went back on campus and my life just changed. It was just it was just day and night. I was just a new creatur. I was a different man. Anybody who knew me asked me what happened to you like you're so different. What's going on? People say, "I want to go to your church." It's not because I was talking to them about anything because my life was speaking for itself. And they saw that I wasn't a Christian like the other Christians. I was different. And what it was, I don't know. It's just God. God bearing witness that there's something different. And that's what the world seeing you. They might be Christians. They might go to church, but they know that there's something different about the bride. She is different. &gt;&gt; And then one by one, they started coming on campus and coming to church with me. And my my burden My burden was for the for the entire all my friends to hear this message and it became such a growing burden like brother Moses and I were talking yesterday these are things that you cannot you cannot reproduce right like no matter how much I try today I can never replicate those things it was for a season God did it sovereignly I cannot explain the type of burden he placed on me it was not my doing it wasn't that I was so diligent in consecration it wasn't It was just that God had placed such a burden on me that he weighed on me so much. I remember every day I'll come I'll come from from class I'll go into the dorms I remember I'll throw my bag on the floor and get on my knees and start weeping and praying. My burn was so great to see the word in these people, to see them get the word and believe the message. And then I started witnessing, witnessing, witnessing, witnessing. And then the first person that believed and got baptized was the catalyst because I know if one can believe, two can believe, three can believe. And then that set me on fire. And then we started holding meetings on campus. And some young people from the church started coming to those meetings on campus. And God started saving those in the church have a backseat and on campus. &gt;&gt; Now you talk about sovereign grace doing whatever he wants to do not in church but in university. He took churchgoing people, brought them to a university and saved them there and brought them back to church and then that's how the what we know as SFA revival be began to spread and one by one newcomers got saved back came back to God and just prayer meetings broke forth in the church and there were just special times in house till 2 or 3:00 people were worshiping and in praying and go back to work the next day. You cannot reproduce those things anymore. There there was just such a a anction in atmosphere around that time that we could be in prayer for hours and hours. We did not want to separate from one another. We just want to be together and pray and worship. Whenever we got together, we broke into prayer and worship. And God moved supernaturally every single day. Like you you felt like you were walking in the Bible. Now I remember one of my friends from from SAU uh is Stephen, brother Steven Kiri who is now a minister. Think about that. We went to university together. He came to the message. I witnessed to him. He got baptized. He went back in Nigeria. I became a minister. Started a church. And then here I am in Toronto a few months ago. And I meet this man. His name is brother Mike. He says, "Brother John, uh, you don't know me, but I know you." He says, "I was brought to the message by brother Stephen." I said, "Oh my goodness, how amazing this is." You never know what God would do, right? Somebody gets it and it starts to spread. And then so one day him and I were walking. I remember we're walking to the bus stop together to catch the bus and we were singing one of them which which I'm going to ask you to sing brother. We're singing together one of them. I'm so glad that I can say just two of us in the street people walking past us and we're just singing one of them. It felt at that moment it felt like there was just a bubble around us. It was just you. It was just him and me and God. And we were we were in this vortex of the presence of God and CATCHING THIS REVELATION. OH, I'M SO GLAD. I'M ONE OF THEM. I'M ONE OF THE FEW THAT GETS TO SEE THIS. IT WAS SUCH A JOY. And we were just rejoicing and saying, "Oh my goodness, what a joy to see this message." And his his life was changed. He was he wanted God. And all the things he was praying about, he found in the message. You know, his joy was like, "This is what MY SOUL WAS CRYING FOR." AND AND I'M ONE OF THEM. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. You know, one of the the greatest throw in my heart and I've said this multiple times is that I love to hear people tell me their testimony and how they came in contact with the message because every single time I hear somebody, it doesn't matter how the testimony is, but I hear the same thing from everyone. What I hear is that they heard what I heard &gt;&gt; and it all it so blesses me that there are people on the earth that have heard what I've heard and we had that in common. We were going about life, living our own life, doing whatever we wanted. But somehow we heard the same thing. &gt;&gt; If you're here together this morning, it's because you all heard the same thing. &gt;&gt; And only you have the ability to hear those things. Those who have not heard them don't have the ability to hear them, BUT YOU HEARD IT. SOMEHOW IT SPOKE TO YOU AND IT SPOKE TO ME. AND WE HAPPEN TO BE HERE TOGETHER because we heard the same thing. And it always thrills me to say, "Oh, God, you're so wonderful." Like, you can go to this one, that way, to this one, that way. But all of us here still, we all heard the call of God. &gt;&gt; We heard our mama eagle coming and screaming and calling us out and we say, "That's me." &gt;&gt; Right? So then uh that's when the Holy Spirit really began to move in the church. And like I said, many people got saved there. And then God started a deal with me. And brother Tom says, "I think God is calling you to preach. Uh I think you should preach. This is 2015." I said, "Nope, definitely not." In 2016, he says, "I think you should preach." I said, "Nope, that's definitely not me." 2017, "I think God's calling you to preach." Nope. That's not my calling. 2018, Brother Jean. I was like, "Uh, no." So, for about seven years, I I kept saying that's I don't think that's what God has called me to do. That's that's just not who I am. That's just I I can't I can't I can't do it. I can't. And like I said, by by your fruits, right? That's why people recognize by your fruits. You don't have to tell people what you are. They tell you who you are but the first you bear. So one day I was listening to a service from brother Donnie Donnie Rian u I encourage you to listen to it if you want to. It's called the danger of an unsurrendered heart. And then he took Samson as Samson Samson gave his gift and his talent and his strength to God, but he gave his heart to a woman, right? And his heart was never fully surrendered. And I was listening to that service. It so convicted me like in in a in such a deep way that I can only explain. And it left me so confused because as far as I knew, I had given my heart to God. As far as I know, I had surrendered my heart to God. I said, "Why am I being convicted by this?" I I know I know what conviction is. I know the Holy Spirit is putting his finger on my heart and say this is you. But why is he saying that? Because I've given my heart to the Lord. I've been baptized. I'm feeling the spirit. I'm serving God. Like why am I feeling this? And then I was just I was just so disturbed by that. But then you know over time that feeling went away. And then I heard another service and then that same feeling came back and then it went away. And then one time, this is back in 2021, brother Murphy was speaking and on a Sunday morning, the Friday night before that, I was pondering on this. I said, Lord, I don't know why I keep feeling this. But clearly, if you're push putting your finger on that, it means that somehow I'm not as surrendered as I think. And I said, but you're going to have to show me what that looks like because I don't know what else to do. I don't know what prayer to pray. I've already prayed. Lord, I give you my heart. I give you everything. You know, I don't know what to do. I really don't know what to do. So that morning, brother Murphy preached and then he's talking about a full surrender. And then he makes his altar call and says, I just been I've been resisting to make this alter call. I wanted to do it last Sunday. I didn't. And God rebuked me for it. So I'm going to do it today. Those who know that you not fully surrender your heart to God. You should come to the front. And I'm standing there in my pew just wrestling with this. Says, I know that God is speaking to me, but I don't know why. like I don't know if I go to the front sure like what is that going to do, right? What am I going to say that's going to be different than what I've already done in the past? I don't really know what God wants for me, but this is really bothering me. And so I'm like, I'm not going to go. So I just stayed and I opened my eyes and it was packed. The altar was packed really, really packed. So I was just I'm just going to stay here and just pray. And then my wife, she managed me. She says, "I would like to come to the front. Would you like to come with me?" I was like, "Uh, okay. Let's go." So We went I went with her and I was just I was in a hallway because it was really packed. So I was probably somewhere there and I I started praying like Lord I don't know why I'm standing here. I don't know why I'm here but I know you're in this. I really don't know what you're calling me to here but you keep telling me I'm not fully surrendered. As far as I know I am. I've done all that I know to do. I've surren what part of me do do you not have? You can have all of it. Everything you want me to be whatever you have for me I surrender all to you. Right. And then I just prayed that prayer and then something just said like go see brother Tom. So I opened my eyes and he just finished praying with somebody and he was getting up. So I just tapped on my shoulder and I said, "Brother Tom, I want you to pray with me." And he turned around and says, "What is it?" And I said, "Brother Tom, I don't know what this is, but every single time I hear this type of a sermon, I really get convicted." Then I I just broke down. I says, I said, "I don't know what it is, but it's just one leave me alone. There's something something that I'm not done yet." He says, Oh, brother Je. Oh, brother Je said, "Let's pray." And then he says, "Lord, there was once a man called Isaiah who heard the voice of God and he said, Lord, here I am sending me." I was like, "Oh, no. This is what it is." No. And it says, "You have been calling brother Jean. Now may he say, here I am. Send me." Oh my goodness. That's when I understood what it was. And that's why I surrendered everything to God. And I say, "Lord, if this is what you want me to do, I will do it. I'm terrified. I might fail. I might be I might ruin my life because says you will ruin your life. If God didn't call you to do it, you will." And I'm like, "But if my life is going to be ruined for trying to trust you, so be it. I'm just going to trust you in this." So we finished praying. I went back to my seat. The church is dismissed. And I'm sitting there and something tells me, "You're preaching Wednesday." And this is Sunday morning, right? Says, "You're preaching Wednesday." said, "No, I mean, I just surrendered to God." And I'm like, "No, this cannot be happening." I grabbed my Bible and I left the church so fast. I walked so fast. As I was going out, a brother tapped me on the back. He says, "Brother Tom wants to see you." I was like, "Yeah, just that's it." I knew exactly what I was going to be. Step in his office and he said, "This is the time God is calling you. You're gonna have to preach on Wednesday." So, we went ahead and preached first sermon 2021 and Since then, God has been faithful to us and we continue to try to do something for the bride. And do do we make mistakes? Yes. Do we regret this? Not a chance. Cannot cannot regret. It's a privilege to be a part of what God doing is doing in these last days. And I have such a great love and respect for the bride that whenever I step here, I says, "Lord, these are your purchase." I don't believe in beating down the bride and making her feel worthless and useless and that she's not good enough. No, I believe I have to tell you how God sees you. No matter how you see yourself, that's irrelevant. What I want you to understand is what God sees you. And I always try by the grace of God to uplift you with every time I speak that you might go home loving God more. And I hope that the word did that this morning. So in a nutshell, that's that's my my my testimony. I hope that was a blessing to you as well. Brother Ray, why don't we stand? And I just really wanted to sing this song.
