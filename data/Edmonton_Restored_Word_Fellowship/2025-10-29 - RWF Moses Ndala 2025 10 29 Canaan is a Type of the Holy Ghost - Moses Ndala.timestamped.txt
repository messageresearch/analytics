[14:33] know how brother Henry, brother Moses
[14:35] and brother Zig how they do it or they
[14:38] did it but sometimes it's so difficult
[14:40] during the week you got all these things
[14:42] to go through and then you still have to
[14:44] come to church and not just come to
[14:47] church we all come to church [music] but
[14:49] you have responsibilities like brother
[14:52] Andrew has to eat songs brother Moses
[14:54] has to preach like what brother Zig used
[14:56] to do you know sometimes you just got to
[14:58] thank them for doing what they do we
[15:00] thank God for them, having them in our
[15:02] lives. Let's go to the Lord in prayer if
[15:05] you don't mind.

[16:47] makes you happy more than
[16:49] &gt;&gt; people who take time out of their lives
[16:53] to do your work.
[16:56] &gt;&gt; May you may they find favor in you,
[16:59] Lord. May you give them strength, Lord.
[17:02] May they find that one last seed that
[17:07] may make the whole mission complete,

[22:30] &gt;&gt; When brother Zigg told us that he was
[22:32] looking for someone to take over, I had
[22:35] a a fear
[22:37] [music] that who is going to come and
[22:40] take over this church?
[22:42] Are we going to be safe? And I just it's
[22:47] it's overwhelming to see what God is
[22:49] doing right now. how brother Moses is
[22:53] just yielding to everywhere God is
[22:56] taking him. He's he's been all over and
[22:58] just putting everything together. And I
[23:01] I I am I am mesmerized. I don't know
[23:04] what to say. I [music] just want to
[23:06] thank God that everything that we've
[23:08] been praying for, that we've been
[23:10] waiting for,
[23:11] &gt;&gt; he's bringing it into shape. a little
[23:15] church [music] that didn't no longer had
[23:17] people and just God has been bringing
[23:20] people from all over and we [music]
[23:22] can't be more grateful that he had has
[23:26] had given us a pastor that had pastored
[23:28] this church for many years and he had he
[23:31] had he listened to the leadership of the
[23:34] Lord because he would have been like any
[23:36] other man just continue being the p the
[23:40] pastor of this church but he had to
[23:42] listen and We don't know what God where
[23:45] don't know where God is taking us, but
[23:48] we're just believing.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; What we've waited for
[23:57] has come [singing]
[23:58] to [music] pass.

[27:38] for you.
[27:50] Amen.
[27:51] Amen. Makes me think I was talking with
[27:54] one one of my one of my friends. He was
[27:56] confiding in me and he was just having
[27:58] just
[28:00] like a stressful time. Like they they
[28:02] just had another baby and life is very
[28:04] expensive and I I've known him since
[28:06] like first grade. best friends and and
[28:10] he was telling me was just kind of just
[28:13] unloading on me and I'm I'm there for
[28:15] him and I'm his friend and and I told
[28:17] him like I got your back and that's like
[28:18] all I needed to say and like I was like
[28:21] no matter what happens it's like I'm if
[28:23] I can help you financially I'm going to
[28:24] help you financially if I'm going to you
[28:25] know if if something breaks because he's
[28:27] worried about like if something breaks
[28:28] I'm like I'm like we'll fix it or like
[28:31] we'll figure it out. And like it just
[28:34] makes me think is like when we we read
[28:37] the word it's it's all affirmation to us
[28:40] &gt;&gt; because we're we're God's children where
[28:42] his bride and everywhere you see in the
[28:44] Bible like
[28:47] any bride any child was taken care of by
[28:49] their father. Everything that happened
[28:51] in the Bible was to was to fulfill the
[28:54] purpose of God to provide for you.
[28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:58] &gt;&gt; And it's Yeah. And and I told him in the
[29:00] end, I was like, I've been where you've
[29:03] been. And it just that's what's awesome
[29:06] about the Lord is we get so caught up
[29:08] and so uh like shut in and and caught up
[29:13] with the things and then God is still
[29:15] the same God he always was. like I've
[29:18] been my till you just turned eight and
[29:22] I don't know how I made it this far but
[29:24] you know as an as an adult and and like
[29:27] I don't I don't feel like an adult but
[29:28] the Lord's led me this whole way and
[29:31] &gt;&gt; he's provided even no matter how like
[29:34] shaken I've been or or how like lost
[29:38] I've felt in this world. It's just God's
[29:40] still the same and I'm still waking up
[29:42] every day in my house and I'm still
[29:44] going to work and the the Lord just has
[29:46] provided everything and you just forget
[29:49] what how stressed you were and and all
[29:52] the things that the Lord's provided for
[29:54] you. So I just yeah
[29:56] &gt;&gt; I just thank him that he yeah
[29:58] &gt;&gt; there's and even what Sister Estard said
[30:00] is you know like you you worry and and I
[30:03] just I always kind of had a burden on my
[30:06] heart for this church because it's just
[30:08] we're a small group and I don't want a
[30:10] small group to get lost in a big group
[30:11] and I'm not saying I'm not saying it's
[30:13] bad to to go to other churches and be
[30:15] part of them and like I enjoy I go to
[30:17] brother Edson Sunday but it's just yeah
[30:19] I want the Lord to have his way here and
[30:22] there as well. So
[30:24] &gt;&gt; amen. Um let's as brother Moses come,
[30:27] let's sing uh Oh happy day.

[32:40] &gt;&gt; on his face
[32:43] center to [singing] rest
[32:46] nor ever from
[32:49] my Lord [music] depart
[32:52] with him of every
[32:55] good possession.
[32:57] &gt;&gt; Happy day.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; Oh happy day. [singing]
[33:01] Oh happy day.
[33:03] When Jesus wash
[33:06] [music and singing] my sins away.
[33:09] He taught me how
[33:12] to watch and pray [singing]
[33:15] and live rejoiceing
[33:19] every day.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; Oh [singing] happy day.
[33:21] &gt;&gt; Oh happy day.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; Oh happy day.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; Happy day [music]
[33:27] when Jesus washed
[33:30] my sins away.
[33:34] Glory to his name.
[33:36] Glory to his name. [applause]
[33:39] There's no [music] better thing than to
[33:41] realize that I'm forgiven.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; Not only forgiven, I'm justified
[33:47] &gt;&gt; as if I've never done it to begin with.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; What a happy day. [laughter]
[33:52] Can you imagine your bank account is
[33:54] minus minus minus and then one day you
[33:56] find, oh, I'm plus 100 [laughter]
[34:01] million.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; 1 MILLION. OH, PRAISE BE TO GOD.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; NO ANYMORE. [laughter]
[34:07] Now I think about spiritually I'm
[34:09] speaking now.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; That's what we are in God's economy.
[34:12] Praise be to God.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. I greet you in the name of the
[34:17] Lord Jesus Christ evening. Good to be in
[34:19] the house of the Lord for a night of
[34:22] prayer [music] and fellowship with the
[34:24] Lord. Amen.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; And we had wonderful services on Sunday.
[34:29] Just been thinking about it and
[34:30] meditating upon it. Just been a
[34:32] blessing. Amen. We thank God for brother
[34:34] Boris coming and being a blessing for us
[34:37] and just praising the Lord. Amen.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; And then way of announcement we have a
[34:42] youth meeting on Friday
[34:45] uh with at 6:30 quiet time and seven
[34:49] songs start. Just keep that in prayer.
[34:52] Amen.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; Just go to the Lord and pray this
[34:54] evening. Father, we thank you once again
[34:56] to be in the house of the Lord. How
[34:58] thankful we should be Lord to know you
[35:00] and
[35:02] &gt;&gt; just to serve you father Lord and to
[35:04] know that we are your children both with
[35:07] a price of your own life that was shed
[35:11] for the the own blood that was shed and
[35:14] the life of God that he came out Father
[35:16] Lord so that today we can be beneficiary
[35:19] of that blessing in our life father we
[35:21] thank you for that. What a wonderful day
[35:24] Lord we have to be living in
[35:26] &gt;&gt; when the word of God has been opened
[35:29] father the Bible has become a new book
[35:31] for us
[35:32] &gt;&gt; father that you have restored Lord Jesus
[35:34] Christ what has been lost and the garden
[35:37] of Eden for being restored father to us
[35:39] to recognize that we are now bought back
[35:42] to the fellowship with our father Lord
[35:44] we can come to you Lord without any
[35:47] intermediary may another person another
[35:50] man between us and you but we can come
[35:52] directly
[35:53] have access to the throne of grace to
[35:56] the mercy seat. Have access, Father
[35:58] Lord, to the inner chamber with you with
[36:01] the king and have fellowship with you,
[36:03] Father, Lord Jesus Christ. The blood has
[36:06] restored us back, Lord, to the status of
[36:08] a son and daughter of God once again,
[36:10] Lord, even to the point where nature can
[36:13] obey to us, Father. Lord, we thank you,
[36:15] Father, that the sword of the word of
[36:17] God has been restored to the to man once
[36:20] again. Lord, the book that was lost has
[36:22] been res restored back to a man. Father,

[36:27] our heart. Father, Lord Jesus Christ, we
[36:30] thank you. We praise you, Lord Jesus

[36:44] that has been created. Thank you for
[36:45] each one that brought liquor fire for
[36:47] this service, Lord, and the visitors. We
[36:50] bless them and welcome them father as we
[36:52] commit all the service to you in Jesus
[36:54] Christ's name. Amen.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:00] Good to have you and
[37:03] good to see you matey. I was wondering
[37:05] on Sunday mat is never miss service
[37:09] where is she? [laughter]
[37:11] And I asked the children mommy traveled
[37:13] to Calgary. of of
[37:17] I don't want to lose mama mati. I will
[37:19] follow you wherever you are.
[37:23] She she's the faithful
[37:26] sheep. Never miss a service. Never never
[37:30] for whatever reason never miss a
[37:32] service. I was a little bit worried and
[37:35] pastor Boris apparently knows her
[37:36] because um her older sister is one of
[37:39] the few who started the s the church
[37:42] there and um
[37:45] how can I forget the name
[37:50] she's one of the few started the service
[37:52] when there was still a small group so on
[37:55] dedication she had to give a testimony
[37:57] how the struggle this small group
[37:59] they're moving from one place one but
[38:01] she has always been faithful. So now it
[38:04] seems like that that runs in the family.
[38:08] Mat has always been faithful. So he
[38:12] asked me how Mat said, "No, she's never
[38:14] missed a service." The only time I saw
[38:17] Mr. Service was when she had the
[38:19] dedication uh graduation for her
[38:22] daughter and she warned me that I won't
[38:24] be there. That's the only time I ever
[38:26] seen it. And on Sunday she was not
[38:28] there. I was like, "Huh? What's going?"
[38:30] [laughter]
[38:31] and requires no she traveled so she's
[38:34] excused justified that she's never done
[38:36] it.
[38:38] We appreciate you ma God bless you
[38:43] and um
[38:45] and we have James and Ruth have been
[38:47] already welcome I guess.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; So good to have you here and the
[38:51] children Mia and and Bon
[38:56] Bon God bless you richly feel welcome.
[39:00] Genesis 12,
[39:23] Genesis 12
[39:34] Now the Lord had said unto Abraham, "Get
[39:36] thee out of thy country, and from thy
[39:38] kindred, and from thy father's house,
[39:41] into a land that I will show thee." I've
[39:44] been on the subject of the possessing
[39:46] the the land for for a few Wednesdays
[39:48] now. And I will make of thee a great
[39:51] nation. I will bless thee, and make thy
[39:53] name great, and thou shalt be a
[39:55] blessing. and I will bless them that
[39:58] bless thee, and curse him that curse
[40:00] thee, and in thee shall all families of
[40:03] the earth be blessed.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; So Abraham departed, and the Lord has
[40:07] spoken unto him, and Lot went with him.
[40:10] And Abraham was 70 and five years old
[40:14] when he departed out of Aaron, Heron.
[40:17] And Abraham took Sarai, his wife, and
[40:20] Lot, his brother's son, and all the
[40:23] substance that they had gathered, and
[40:25] the souls that they had gotten in Heron,
[40:28] and they went forth to go into the land
[40:30] of Canaan, and to the land of Canaan.
[40:33] They came and Abraham passed through the
[40:36] land into the place of Sish, unto the
[40:39] plain of Morab. And the Canaanite was
[40:41] then in the land. And the Lord appeared
[40:44] unto Abraham, and said, Unto thy seed
[40:48] will I give this land, and there
[40:51] buildeth an altar unto the Lord who
[40:53] appearth unto him. May God bless his
[40:56] word, and have seizing,
[41:01] unto thy seed will I give this land
[41:06] is the land of the Canaanite.
[41:15] and to thy seed will I give this land.
[41:19] I will talk about um canon
[41:22] the type of the Holy Ghost.
[41:25] Canon the type of the Holy Ghost
[41:28] for a few minutes before going to prayer
[41:30] here just want to put few comments here.
[41:33] In the book of Hebrews it also say that
[41:36] it was given to them as a promise.
[41:39] Hebrews chapter 4 says, "Let us
[41:41] therefore fear lest a promise being left
[41:44] us of entering into his rest any of you
[41:47] should seem to come short of it. For
[41:50] unto us was the gospel preached as well
[41:52] as unto them." But the word preached did
[41:55] not profit them, not being mixed with
[41:57] faith in them that heard it. It's
[41:59] talking about Israel coming out of Egypt
[42:01] and going into the promised land. It was
[42:04] those seed that that sea that should
[42:05] possess the land. But there there the
[42:08] the gospel or the word that was spoken
[42:10] to them was not mixed with faith. That's
[42:13] why they could not enter into the rest.
[42:15] And and then and then in verse 8 just to
[42:18] save time, Paul says, "For if Jo Jesus,
[42:22] which is Joshua here, if Joshua had
[42:25] given them rest, then would he not
[42:28] afterward have spoken of another day,
[42:31] there remainth therefore a rest to the
[42:33] people of God. For he that is entered
[42:35] into his rest, he also has ceased from
[42:38] his own works as God did from his, let
[42:42] us labor. Therefore, to enter into that
[42:44] rest, lest any man fall after the same
[42:47] example of unbelief. So in order to go
[42:50] into that rest, you need to have faith.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; You need to believe the word of God.
[42:54] Seems like a little bit contradictory
[42:56] where I will be going, but it was just
[42:58] good to put is a principle. The word of
[43:01] God has to be mixed with faith. You have
[43:04] to believe the word of God. Otherwise,
[43:05] the word of God is profitth nothing to
[43:08] reason. Doesn't do anything unless you
[43:10] believe what is been told to you. Yeah.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; So the thought that I'll take here is a
[43:15] simple thought the prophet spoken about
[43:17] many times in many places just caught my
[43:20] attention recently again as I listening
[43:22] to the tape says how many read back in
[43:24] Deuteronomy chapter one there where the
[43:27] spies went right in there and tested of
[43:30] the things from Canaan which Canaan is
[43:33] not the type of the millennium. So
[43:36] Canaan is not the type of the
[43:37] millennium. How many knows that you mean
[43:41] just one hand Junius? So the only
[43:43] &gt;&gt; brother Junior
[43:46] replied and said that's right. Says
[43:48] Kenan is not a type of the millennium.
[43:51] So it's not a type of millennium. We
[43:52] know as a believer there will be a
[43:54] millennium.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; We believe in the real millennium that
[43:57] will happen to us. A millennium is a
[43:59] place where the our bodies will be
[44:01] changed. As we heard on on Sunday, our
[44:03] bodies will be changed. We won't be
[44:05] having this body of of flesh that is
[44:08] still suffering that is full of full of
[44:10] diseases. It is a past house but we have
[44:13] a new body where there will not be
[44:15] sickness. There will be no tiredness.
[44:17] There will be no not even evil thought.
[44:19] Everything will be just be perfect.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; That's why our future is brighter. We're
[44:24] looking forward to that time. Amen.
[44:26] Where we won't have to die anymore. No
[44:29] more dying. Amen. No more crying even.
[44:32] It will be all joy forever in the
[44:35] presence of almighty God. Praise be to
[44:37] God.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; And we'll be on that millennium and
[44:41] won't have anything. But the prophet
[44:42] says here canon is not a type of that
[44:45] millennium. But because it give the
[44:48] reason because they had wars and
[44:51] fightings and killings and everything
[44:54] else in Canaan.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; It's type to the holy and then stop
[44:58] there. Canaan is a type of the Holy
[45:01] Ghost. So Canaan is a type of the Holy
[45:04] Ghost. Egypt is the world that they came
[45:07] out. They came out of the wilderness is
[45:10] where they were they were sanctified
[45:13] called out church. Canaan is where they
[45:16] settled down with the Holy Spirit
[45:19] because they still had wars. If you
[45:22] don't believe you have wars, just get
[45:24] the Holy Spirit once.
[45:27] Praise be to God. I like what pastor
[45:30] Boris said it on on the Sunday no on the
[45:32] weekend. So no it's it's not it's not
[45:34] it's not an easy road sometimes you know
[45:37] Jacob had had the blessings from the
[45:39] time he had the blessings then problem
[45:42] start
[45:43] &gt;&gt; the same thing as well the moment you
[45:45] have the Holy Ghost that's where real
[45:47] wars start. Amen. That's where it
[45:50] becomes like that that that that chief
[45:52] that that that chief Indian was asked
[45:55] what how is it now? How is it now? Now
[45:57] that you have the Holy Ghost, how is it?
[45:59] So, oh no, now it's even worse, man.
[46:02] Because now I have two dogs fighting
[46:04] inside of me. There is a black one and
[46:06] there is a white one. And the chief, can
[46:09] you tell me which one is winning? Oh, I
[46:11] I can I can give you which one is
[46:13] winning. The one I feed the most is the
[46:15] one winning.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; I'm born again, but the one I feed the
[46:18] most is one that's winning. If I'm
[46:20] feeding on the negative things and
[46:22] things like that, oh, then I'm down,
[46:24] down, down, down, down. But if I feed my
[46:26] soul, if I feed the Holy Ghost with the
[46:29] word of God, then he's winning, then
[46:31] he's overcoming. Amen.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is to save is to to save
[46:35] you and also to make you a servant of
[46:38] God. So that you serve others with the
[46:40] Holy Ghost that you have inside of you.
[46:42] The Holy Ghost is do those things. But
[46:44] there's something else. In order to have
[46:46] an overcoming life, you need to feed
[46:48] that Holy Ghost with the word of God.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is there to help you to
[46:53] fight. Amen.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost is not there
[46:56] as we sometimes we have the impressions,
[46:58] oh the Holy Ghost is a millennium. It's
[47:01] not a millennium in this flesh. The Holy
[47:03] Ghost, the cannon is not a millennium.
[47:06] The Holy Ghost is a place where there
[47:08] are still some fighting, something you
[47:10] have to overcome, something you have to
[47:12] struggle with. Oh, but I have the Holy
[47:15] Ghost. Yes, you have the Holy Ghost, but
[47:16] you still fight. You still press on. You
[47:19] still move on. AMEN. IT'S STILL A
[47:21] BATTLE. IS STILL something you have to
[47:23] continue working and God is giving you
[47:27] rest in the soul. Amen.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; But in the outside you STILL NEED TO
[47:31] PRESS ON. AMEN.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; PUT this body under subjection of the
[47:34] word of God. The body SAYS NO DON'T DO
[47:37] IT. YOU SAY NO I HAVE TO DO IT. AMEN. SO
[47:39] I FEEL LIKE PRAISING THE LORD AND THE
[47:41] HOLY SPIRIT SAID YOU have to praise the
[47:43] Lord. I DON'T FEEL LIKE RAISING MY HAND.
[47:45] YOU RAISE YOUR HAND. AMEN.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; I DON'T FEEL LIKE GOING TO CHURCH. YOU
[47:49] HAVE TO GO TO CHURCH. DRAG THIS BODY TO
[47:52] CHURCH.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE IN [screaming] THE WAR. AMEN.
[47:54] KEEP GOING. AMEN.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; I don't feel like singing.
[47:59] Sing. [laughter]
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU ARE IN THE WAR. [screaming]
[48:05] IF YOU HAVE THE HOLY GHOST, if you don't
[48:07] have the Holy Ghost, the body says, "I
[48:09] feel like doing it. I don't feel like
[48:11] doing it." Or then you just obey because
[48:12] there is nothing to press on. You just
[48:14] obey what the body says. If you, "Oh, I
[48:17] feel like doing this." And you just do
[48:18] what? because you are subject to
[48:20] something. There's no fight. There's no
[48:22] fight. Your conscience is just being so
[48:24] dimmed down that you just follow
[48:26] whatever the thought comes, whatever the
[48:28] body comes. But when you have the Holy
[48:30] Ghost, THERE IS A FIGHT.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; THERE IS A STRUGGLE. AMEN.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Says if you don't believe you have wars,
[48:38] just get the Holy Spirit once.
[48:43] So what are you doing?
[48:45] What do you do in Canaan? They were
[48:48] possessing the rights. They were
[48:51] possessing the rights. Another place
[48:54] they had the rights to have that land.
[48:57] It was given to them. But now outside of
[49:00] the land, you can't possess anything.
[49:02] You just in theory. So when I will be
[49:04] there, when I will be there. But once
[49:06] you are in the land, then you start
[49:08] possessing. I have to possess the joy of
[49:11] salvation. I have to possess it. Amen.
[49:14] Before that, if you possess it, it will
[49:16] just be an emotion here and then, here
[49:19] and there, here and there. But when you
[49:20] have the Holy Ghost, it becomes your
[49:22] right. YOU CAN CLAIM IT. AMEN.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; But many times you will say, you know,
[49:27] you know, oh, healing can be given to
[49:29] everybody. You can be healed whether
[49:32] you're a son of God or not the son of
[49:33] God, you can be healed. But to maintain
[49:36] that healing, you have to believe.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; You maintain that healing, you have to
[49:40] believe. Amen. the [clears throat] same
[49:41] thing. Oh no, you know you you can feel
[49:43] so emotional, you're happy and
[49:45] everything and then it stays there. But
[49:47] in order to maintain there, you have to
[49:49] continue believe believing. You have to
[49:52] continue saying, "God, I take you at
[49:54] your word. I'm not following what my
[49:56] thought is saying. I'm not following
[49:58] what my body is saying. I'm I'm OBEYING
[50:00] WHAT YOUR WORD SAYS." AMEN.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; YOU POSSESS your right. You claim your
[50:05] right.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Say, "Glory." They were possessing the
[50:08] right. They could not possess the right
[50:10] till they got into Canaan. They didn't
[50:13] own nothing. They didn't own nothing in
[50:17] the wilderness. Then when they come into
[50:19] Canaan, then they had rights. We've got
[50:22] right.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; When you receive the Holy Ghost, you are
[50:26] in Canaan. You you you have to fight for
[50:30] it. Every inch of ground, you have to
[50:33] fight for it.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; The promise is given to you, but you
[50:36] have to fight for it. You have to fight
[50:39] for it. Yes sir. That's the reason
[50:41] people say you pray for me today. All
[50:44] right. We'll see. It says then it says
[50:46] get over in Canon once brother. And you
[50:49] realize where you belong. Watch prayer
[50:51] start being turned around. Yes sir. You
[50:54] say look here Satan. This is mine. I'm a
[50:58] possessor of this. GOD SAID SO. MOVE
[51:00] OUT. So that's right. That's right. Move
[51:03] off my ground. See your ground. Satan
[51:07] says, Satan says your ground and he says
[51:10] I have an abstract DEED TO EAT. MOVE
[51:13] OUT.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; ABSTRACT means you have a proof. Move
[51:16] out because now this land doesn't belong
[51:19] to you anymore. It used to pertain to
[51:22] Canonites, but now it's not yours
[51:24] anymore because I have the abstract
[51:26] deal.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; I belong to God. Amen.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Move out. You don't. I'll serve notice
[51:32] on you by the Holy Spirit guidance. He
[51:35] moves out. Sure. He has to. Amen.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. As I'm going on this
[51:40] side, Abraham was in Canaan, but it was
[51:42] not as he Abraham was in Canaan. I've
[51:46] expressing this thought for a couple of
[51:47] services now, but I feel like I can go
[51:49] back into it. Abraham when he was in
[51:52] Canaan, he did not possess everything.
[51:54] He did not possess all things at once.
[51:56] He didn't he didn't possess the whole
[51:58] canon at once. He he he had it
[52:01] potentially. It belong. He was the owner
[52:03] of it, but didn't he didn't possess
[52:04] everything all at once. He just bought
[52:07] one small land and it was a bearing
[52:09] place. Just a bearing place. Think about
[52:11] it. He's the owner of everything, but he
[52:13] just buy a a sweet humble bearing place.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Just a symbol that this is a token for
[52:21] the land that God has given me. And not
[52:23] only to me, but to my seed as well.
[52:25] That's the place where they will be
[52:27] buried. Amen. PRAISE BE TO GOD. THANK
[52:30] God for having Abraham.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Thank God for someone saying, you know,
[52:34] this is my land and I'm already putting
[52:36] there, you know, it's it's like
[52:38] Americans or other nations when they go
[52:40] to the moon. They used to do that in
[52:42] Africa and other places when the the
[52:44] first person who arrived there just have
[52:46] to put a flag. Once you put a flag, it
[52:48] belongs to you. It's a small sign, but
[52:51] it shows there already that no one can
[52:52] take that because it belongs to you.
[52:55] Thank God for Abraham putting a flag.
[52:57] They say I PUT THIS BY FAITH. BY FAITH,
[53:00] &gt;&gt; I've been find righteous by righteous by
[53:02] God. THEREFORE, WHOEVER WILL BELIEVE IN
[53:05] GOD WILL BE JUSTIFIED BY FAITH.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR ABRAHAM putting that flag
[53:09] there.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Today, we can COME BASED ON THAT.
[53:13] BECAUSE I BELIEVE, THY FAITH has saved
[53:15] thee. As the brother say, thy faith HAS
[53:17] SAVED THEE. BECAUSE I BELIEVE in the
[53:19] word of God, you are justified.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Abraham only had a small person. Isaac
[53:25] didn't have didn't have any like it was
[53:28] like a pilgrim in the land walking here
[53:30] and there walking here and there and
[53:32] then all he had to do is just to dig
[53:34] dwell wells to dig wells. So this is my
[53:38] place. This is the place of Abraham. But
[53:40] Isaac does do you know that it belongs
[53:42] to you? Yes, I know it belongs to me but
[53:44] I don't possess it yet.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you following me?
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when Jacob came, he found that
[53:52] land that Abraham bought. But and you
[53:55] know there was some dispute here and
[53:56] there. It belongs to you. It doesn't
[53:57] belong to even I had to pay it once
[53:59] again. He pay again for me. No, I have
[54:01] to pay it and buy it because I believe
[54:04] that this belongs to us. Praise be to
[54:06] God. I believe that this belong to us.
[54:09] My thought here is to say that
[54:12] God has a season for every situation.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Abraham had a promise but it was
[54:20] not the season for him to possess the
[54:22] whole land.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; It was not the season for him to possess
[54:26] the whole God knew that you will come at
[54:28] some point.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; God knew that he will send he will send
[54:31] Moses at some point and he will send
[54:34] Joshua at some point to divide the land
[54:37] for that season.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; God has as the prophet we call it five
[54:41] must.
[54:43] You can have a promise but that promise
[54:45] has to have a certain season for it to
[54:47] be fulfilled.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Like Luther could never preach the
[54:50] message that we have because it was not
[54:53] a season for him to have the message
[54:55] that we have.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Even though he have read the Bible, have
[54:59] written the Bible, he went through this,
[55:01] he have translated in German and all
[55:03] that, but he couldn't have the
[55:05] revelation of the word of God that we
[55:07] have received because it was not the
[55:10] season. It was not THE SEASON YET. IT
[55:13] HAD to come at the end time that God
[55:15] will send a prophet to open the word OF
[55:18] GOD FOR US.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; NOW WE CAN GO INTO THE LAND of the Holy
[55:22] Ghost and POSSESS ALL THE LAND.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; THAT'S MY THOUGHT.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; WE ARE IN THE season of possessing all
[55:31] the land.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; We are in the season of claiming all our
[55:37] rights in the land. It's not a season
[55:40] where we can start thinking you know
[55:42] what maybe maybe I can postpone it on
[55:44] the other time and you know the devil is
[55:47] a so is so smart is is a subtle enemy
[55:50] you know when it's not your season
[55:53] he will try to make you think it's that
[55:55] season
[55:58] amen and make you frustrated know why
[56:00] you don't get this and this and no it's
[56:04] just not your season just be patient it
[56:07] will come maybe One of my subject I like
[56:10] that subject actually very a lot because
[56:12] it's something I struggle with myself a
[56:14] lot. Patience.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Patience is something that is lacking in
[56:19] this last generation that we are living.
[56:21] We want everything to be instantaneous.
[56:23] You know, just instantaneous. Oh, then
[56:25] oh yeah, then then I believe. Oh,
[56:27] sometimes you know no, the one you know
[56:29] if you have faith to have a miracle then
[56:32] you have faith.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Says actually sometimes the opposite is
[56:37] the one who doesn't get it
[56:38] instantaneously
[56:39] and he still trust in God. He has
[56:42] sometimes more faith than the one we get
[56:45] instantaneously
[56:47] &gt;&gt; because patience is a hard thing to
[56:50] have. We want everything
[56:52] instantaneously. That's one side. The
[56:55] other side is you know it's your season
[56:59] to claim it but you will put it for
[57:01] another for you. No, it's not for you.
[57:03] It's for another time. for another time.
[57:06] In the millennium, you know, in the
[57:08] millennium, then you can sing as the way
[57:10] you want to sing. In the millennium,
[57:12] then you can rejoice when you see that
[57:14] you are really saved. No, you can start
[57:16] today rejoicing
[57:18] &gt;&gt; because THAT'S YOUR SEASON for rejoicing
[57:21] today. Amen.
[57:23] You can't put says people believe that
[57:26] only they will have divine healing only
[57:28] in the millennium. SO THERE IS NO NEED
[57:30] FOR DIVINE HEALING IN THE MILLENNIUM.
[57:32] DIVINE HEALING IS NOW. THAT'S YOUR
[57:35] SEASON. [screaming] NOW YOU HAVE THE
[57:37] EARNEST OF THE RESURRECTION. NOW IT'S
[57:40] YOUR SEASON. AMEN. PRAISE BE TO GOD.
[57:42] CLAIM IT. IT PART OF YOUR POSSESSION.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; WHO WILL BE SICK?
[57:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHY you want to put in the
[57:50] millennium? Exactly. Who will be sick in
[57:52] the MIDDLE OF WE HAVE PERFECT BODIES.
[57:54] WHY WOULD WE require
[57:57] divine healing on the other side?
[57:58] [laughter]
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Amen.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; And we are in the season for it.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; The prophet says in the exposition of
[58:10] the church age, he says those in the
[58:12] bride do only his will. No one can make
[58:14] them do otherwise. They have that save
[58:16] the law or or they keep still. They know
[58:19] that it has to be God's in them doing
[58:21] the works, fulfilling his own word. He
[58:24] did not complete all his work while in
[58:27] this earthly ministry. So now he works
[58:30] in you and through the bride. She knows
[58:33] that he works in and through the bride.
[58:36] She knows that for it was not yet time
[58:38] for him to do certain things that he
[58:41] must now do.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; But he will now fulfill through the
[58:45] bride that work which he left for this
[58:48] specific time.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; EVEN THE LORD JESUS Christ didn't
[58:52] couldn't do anything
[58:54] that some part he has to put for the
[58:57] bride.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:59] I will give you one example in Isaiah
[59:02] 51. As he's reading the scroll, it stops
[59:05] at the place to set the captive free but
[59:08] leave the day of vengeance another time.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Because it was our time.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Vengeance doesn't mean all necessary
[59:14] judgment. Vengeance means God is giving
[59:17] put everything at the right place. So
[59:20] this is my son. This belongs to them.
[59:22] This is not my son. No, this is a
[59:25] [laughter]
[59:26] how to say it but no these are not part
[59:28] of of the covenant. Let's put that way.
[59:30] These are not part of the covenant.
[59:32] These are part of the covenant. Amen. So
[59:34] God is putting everything at this right
[59:36] place. He's telling the enemy, you know,
[59:38] these are my children. Never touch them.
[59:40] Never touch them. These, you know, don't
[59:43] even get close to them. That's God
[59:45] putting everything at the right place.
[59:46] Amen. The good thing about God's promise
[59:49] is the word of God can never return
[59:53] without being accomplished, without
[59:55] fulfilling the purpose for which it was
[59:57] sent for.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; No matter what, the unbelief only stops
[1:00:01] the unbeliever. God's word has to come
[1:00:04] to pass.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Once God's words comes out, it can never
[1:00:08] it can never just disappear and never
[1:00:10] get fulfilled. Once it is pronounced, it
[1:00:13] has TO COME TO PASS. IS JUST LOOKING FOR
[1:00:16] THE TIME. He's looking for the person
[1:00:19] who can grab that word of God. AMEN.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; AND NOW actually as I was thinking about
[1:00:25] it, you know, it's God's grace to know
[1:00:27] the season for a certain word to be
[1:00:30] fulfilled.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; The evidence of the Holy Ghost is based
[1:00:35] upon recognizing the word of your time,
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; recognizing the word of your season,
[1:00:42] recognizing the word of your day. Amen.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; If you don't recognize the word for your
[1:00:47] day, you are missing the point.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Everybody believe the the message of
[1:00:53] Moses in the time of Jesus.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; We believe Moses. We believe Moses. We
[1:00:59] believe Moses. But it was another
[1:01:01] season.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; COMPLETELY ANOTHER SEASON. NOW WE ARE IN
[1:01:05] THE SEASON OF THE MESSIAH. AMEN.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; YOU MIGHT BELIEVE MOSES, but if you
[1:01:10] don't believe what Moses spoke about the
[1:01:12] day of the Messiah, you are missing the
[1:01:14] point.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Everybody believes No, no, everybody
[1:01:20] believes in Jesus of Nazareth over 2,000
[1:01:23] years ago.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; That's good. And we believe that, TOO.
[1:01:27] PRAISE BE TO GOD. HE WAS BORN AND HE WAS
[1:01:30] BORN IN A mansion and and he grew up and
[1:01:32] then he died on on the cross. That's
[1:01:34] wonderful. BUT THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST
[1:01:37] NOW HAS [screaming] TO COME IN OUR HEART
[1:01:40] TODAY.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; THE SAME THING THAT HE DID THERE HE HAS
[1:01:43] TO DO in the in your body IN YOUR HEART
[1:01:46] TODAY.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE of the the message the word
[1:01:49] of God has to become a REALITY TO YOU
[1:01:51] TODAY. AMEN.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; ONCE YOU GET THE PROMISE FOR YOUR
[1:01:55] SEASON, that's the evidence of the Holy
[1:01:58] Ghost.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:02] So it's God's grace when you can see THE
[1:02:04] PROMISE FOR YOUR SEASON
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; and once you get the promise of your
[1:02:08] season you can claim it according to
[1:02:10] your season. NOW ABRAHAM COULD NOT BE
[1:02:14] there and claiming you know God why I
[1:02:16] don't possess all the land says no your
[1:02:19] portion I've given to you you just
[1:02:21] believe what I've given to you that
[1:02:23] portion here but there will come a time
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; where your seed will possess the whole
[1:02:29] land
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; you know that Abraham didn't have
[1:02:32] Jerusalem
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; he met the king of Salem [clears throat]
[1:02:36] but didn't have Jerusalem
[1:02:39] [laughter]
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; think about it.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; There was a time where Israel
[1:02:45] my 30 minutes are almost over already.
[1:02:48] There was a time where Joshua came and
[1:02:50] he possessed the land,
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; the whole the land they possess the
[1:02:54] land. But God told him, you know,
[1:02:56] Joshua, I want to remove all the enemy
[1:02:59] at once. All of that's all of them in
[1:03:01] one instant. No, it will be one by one,
[1:03:05] little by little, little by little until
[1:03:08] you possess the whole land. Because if I
[1:03:10] remove them all at once, the beast will
[1:03:13] take over.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; And will overtake you.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; You know what the beast are? Beast is
[1:03:21] the character of is a man without
[1:03:23] character. But I'm the same says you see
[1:03:25] a man is full of muscles and everything
[1:03:28] is just a beast. That's just a beast
[1:03:30] part. Any man can have good muscle. You
[1:03:32] go leave the gym, it will pop up, right?
[1:03:35] That's nothing,
[1:03:37] right?
[1:03:38] But the character,
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; going on your knees, that's what shows
[1:03:43] the character.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; So the Holy Ghost is not the end of the
[1:03:47] result. The Holy Ghost is only the
[1:03:49] beginning. It's only the beginning. Once
[1:03:51] you have the Holy Ghost, then God start
[1:03:53] building upon the character. Removing
[1:03:56] all the beast part, all the beast part,
[1:03:58] all the beast part, little by little,
[1:04:00] little valley, little valley, little
[1:04:02] valley. Sometimes you can might be you
[1:04:03] might have the Holy Ghost, you're still
[1:04:04] struggling with temper. That's why we
[1:04:07] temperance. [snorts]
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; You have the new birth, but you are
[1:04:10] growing.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; You're still struggling with temper. And
[1:04:13] then, oh God, help me. Help me. Help me.
[1:04:15] Then God removes that little by little.
[1:04:17] Oh, remove that little by little, little
[1:04:20] by little. But the good thing is you
[1:04:22] have to recognize that it's your
[1:04:24] promise.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; You have to RECOGNIZE IT'S YOUR SEASON.
[1:04:28] DON'T PUT THAT FOR ANOTHER SEASON. IT IS
[1:04:30] YOUR RIGHT. YOU CAN CLAIM IT. AMEN.
[1:04:33] THAT'S WHY WE COME TO THE PRAYER
[1:04:35] MEETING. LORD, I I I have these things.
[1:04:38] I'm struggling with this this or I see
[1:04:39] this thing. God, I'm not putting that
[1:04:41] for ANOTHER SEASON. IT'S MY SEASON. IT'S
[1:04:44] MY TIME. MY LORD, I'M CLAIMING IT.
[1:04:46] [screaming] I'M FIGHTING FOR IT.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; IT'S MY LAND. IT'S MY PORTION. AMEN.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; OH, NO. Get away from from from
[1:04:56] Jerusalem.
[1:04:58] Now, Jerusalem was inhabited my name.
[1:05:01] Jerusalem was inhabited by Jebusite.
[1:05:05] The Jebusites were living properly there
[1:05:07] and even Joshua didn't didn't conquer
[1:05:11] Jerusalem.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; He killed the king of Jerusalem but
[1:05:15] didn't possess Jerusalem.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; It was not the season yet.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; But there come one day
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; David with the anointing OF GOD WITH THE
[1:05:26] ROYAL ANOINTING UPON DAVID. HE SAID NO.
[1:05:28] WHY SHOULD WE WAIT THAT WE SHOULD TAKE
[1:05:31] that that city? That city NEED TO BE
[1:05:34] RECONQUERED ONCE AGAIN. JERUSALEM HAS TO
[1:05:37] BE RECONQUERED. AND HE CONQUERED
[1:05:39] JERUSALEM AND MADE IT THE CAPITAL OF
[1:05:41] ISRAEL FROM DIE. AND IT WAS THE SEASON
[1:05:45] TO CONQUER THAT. WHY? BECAUSE HE HAD THE
[1:05:48] ANOINTING. NOTHING COULD STOP DAVID FROM
[1:05:52] HAVING JERUSALEM BECAUSE HE HAD THE
[1:05:53] ANOINTING. GOLIATH COULDN'T STOP HIM.
[1:05:56] THE BEAR COULD NOT STOP HIM. AMEN. YOU
[1:05:58] KNOW, THE LION COULD NOT STOP HIM. LET
[1:06:00] ME TELL YOU THE SAME THING FOR THE BRIDE
[1:06:02] IN THIS LIFE. BECAUSE IT IS HER SEASON,
[1:06:05] SHE WILL HAVE THE BODY CHANGE. NOTHING
[1:06:07] CAN STOP HER BECAUSE IT IS HER SEASON.
[1:06:11] IT'S THE SEASON OF THE RAPTURE. IT'S THE
[1:06:13] SEASON OF THE RESURRECTION. IT'S THE
[1:06:15] SEASON OF THE BODY CHANGE. IT'S THE
[1:06:18] SEASON ALSO TO CLAIM ALL OUR
[1:06:20] INHERITANCE. AMEN. WHATEVER YOU HAVE
[1:06:22] NEED OF, IT'S RE IT'S RIGHT IN THE HOLY
[1:06:25] GHOST.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; IT'S OUR LAND.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:06:30] AMEN.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; DON'T LET THE ENEMY TELL YOU no no no no
[1:06:32] you can have only this portion this
[1:06:35] portion you can leave it. Oh yeah maybe
[1:06:37] it was in the time of Luther. Luther was
[1:06:40] still developed it last time long time
[1:06:43] ago. Luther was a was was a Christian
[1:06:47] but Luther could get drunk.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine Luther reformation but
[1:06:53] he could get drunk
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; a portion a big portion he left
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; untouched.
[1:06:59] [laughter]
[1:07:00] BUT IN OUR DAYS, OH, WE CAN walk in that
[1:07:03] land. OH, IT'S MY POSSESSION. IT'S MY
[1:07:06] INHERITANCE. IT'S MY SEASON TO GET INTO.
[1:07:09] AMEN.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; WESLEY HAD THE SANCTIFICATION,
[1:07:13] GODLINESS, SANCTIFICATION,
[1:07:16] but he didn't have the BAPTISM OF THE
[1:07:17] HOLY GHOST.
[1:07:19] Just seems to struggle. You know,
[1:07:23] if I was not a Christian, I would have
[1:07:25] done it. But
[1:07:31] But when the Holy Ghost comes, it's our
[1:07:33] land.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, I can go into that. I have no desire
[1:07:37] for it.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; It's there, BUT I HAVE NO DESIRE FOR IT.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; At the beginning, I'm saying, Lord, I
[1:07:43] don't want it. I'm I don't want it. I'm

[1:08:06] happening in my because God HAS REMOVED
[1:08:08] THE DESIRE. PRAISE BE TO GOD. NOW IT

[1:08:21] some fight but there is a time where the
[1:08:24] real millennium will come and we are
[1:08:26] just at the we are just close to it now
[1:08:30] because we at the end of the end time

[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Why we have become possessor of the
[1:09:09] land. Praise be to God. Let me read a
[1:09:12] quote. Yeah.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; The message of faith prophet says
[1:09:20] there was a land looking like God will
[1:09:22] just go down there and send
[1:09:25] a plague and kill all the people out and
[1:09:28] said now the houses are laying there
[1:09:30] just go in and bury the dead or send a
[1:09:34] storm through and scare them all out or
[1:09:36] something. But instead of that he said
[1:09:39] now I've just given you the land. Now
[1:09:42] you've got something to do. Now the
[1:09:44] promise is yours. The land is yours.
[1:09:47] I've already given it to you. Now you go
[1:09:49] over and possess it. Now I'm not going
[1:09:52] to give it to you all in one year. If I
[1:09:56] give it to you all in one year, then the
[1:09:58] wild beast said will come in and
[1:10:00] multiply against you. But just as you
[1:10:02] push out and we are able to take the
[1:10:04] land, I'll give it to you. And just as
[1:10:07] you are able to take the land. What a
[1:10:09] beautiful thing tonight for divine
[1:10:11] healing. The promise is given to you. By
[1:10:14] stripes you are healed. It's yours by
[1:10:16] promise. Now we have to go in and take
[1:10:18] it. Maybe you can't take it all at one
[1:10:21] time. Maybe you can't you can just
[1:10:25] accept it tonight. Like I said this
[1:10:27] morning, if you wanted the oak tree in
[1:10:30] your front yard, somebody gives you an a
[1:10:33] knock on. You've already got oak tree.
[1:10:36] You've got it in seed form. The only
[1:10:38] thing you have to do is plant that seed.
[1:10:41] It will produce the tree. So as soon as
[1:10:44] you get the seed, you've got the tree in
[1:10:47] seed form. Just as soon faith comes by
[1:10:50] hearing, hearing of the word of God.
[1:10:52] Amen.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; So that's what so if it if the Bible
[1:10:56] says you know if you have a if you if
[1:10:58] you have a if you have a faith like that
[1:11:00] master seed just a little master seed
[1:11:02] you can move a mountain
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; but the mountain might not move all of a
[1:11:06] sudden at once maybe just a little grain
[1:11:09] of of sand moves from that MOUNTAIN
[1:11:12] START ALREADY REJOICING. AMEN.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Because that mountain already started
[1:11:16] moving. Maybe doesn't move all OF A
[1:11:18] SUDDEN BUT ALREADY start Thank God.
[1:11:21] THANK GOD. THANK GOD FOR THE HEALING.
[1:11:23] THANK GOD FOR THE PROMISE. THANK GOD FOR
[1:11:26] GIVING ME THE ability to recognize that
[1:11:28] this is the season for my healing. EVEN
[1:11:31] THOUGH IT DOESN'T HAPPEN all of a SUDDEN
[1:11:33] ON ONE MOMENT, BUT THANK GOD FOR THE
[1:11:35] patience that I can wait for it to be
[1:11:38] fulfilled. But today I'm going to praise
[1:11:40] you. Today I'm going to claim it. Today
[1:11:43] I'm going to say that God, your word is
[1:11:45] still the truth. Amen.

[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; We upon the mountain
[1:36:53] talk comes easy.
[1:36:58] When is the valley,
[1:37:02] but in [music] the valley
[1:37:07] of trials and temptation
[1:37:12] that when faith
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; That's so true, isn't it?
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; That's [music] so true. That's so true.
[1:37:21] by the [singing] God on the mountain.
