[8:40] [Music]
[8:45] Sing at 988 M land.
[8:48] [Music]
[8:53] kind of homestead
[8:59] for a country
[9:05] to which I've never
[9:08] [Music]
[9:12] been before.
[9:16] [Music]
[9:17] No sad goodbye
[9:23] will there be spoken
[9:29] and time won't matter
[9:32] [Music]
[9:35] anymore
[9:41] the land
[9:46] I'm lost longing for you.
[9:52] And someday
[9:57] on thee I'll stand
[10:03] where my home
[10:08] shall be eternal.
[10:14] Bu
[10:19] sweet
[10:21] land.
[10:22] [Music]
[10:25] I'm looking now
[10:30] across the river
[10:36] to where my faith
[10:39] [Music]
[10:41] will end in.
[10:46] There's just a few
[10:51] more days to labor
[10:57] than I would
[11:02] my heavenly father.
[11:13] I'm longing for you.
[11:18] And someday
[11:21] [Music]
[11:23] on thee I'll stand
[11:29] where my hope
[11:33] shall be eternal.
[11:39] you lamb,
[11:44] sweet
[11:46] lamb.
[11:50] [Music]
[11:53] the time that we're in the world, it
[11:54] feels like we're
[11:57] we're at the Jordan and we're facing
[11:59] like we're going to cross
[12:01] prophecies that are happening that
[12:05] that were spoken and we're just sitting
[12:08] at the edge of the river waiting for the
[12:10] waters to be parted. So, let's sing that
[12:13] one more time at verse two.
[12:16] I'm looking now
[12:21] across the river
[12:26] to where my faith
[12:31] will end inside.
[12:36] There's just a few
[12:42] more days to labor.
[12:47] And then I'll take
[12:52] my heavenly fly.
[13:01] I'm longing for you.
[13:07] And someday
[13:12] on thee I'll stand
[13:14] [Music]
[13:17] where my hope
[13:21] shall be eternal.
[13:27] Bullet
[13:31] sweet
[13:33] lamb.
[13:37] Maybe if you'll stand up, let's sing
[13:39] 1285, Child of the King.

[16:09] There's I guess a couple prayer
[16:11] requests. We're still praying for
[16:12] brother Moses as he's away and brother
[16:15] Victor I think is traveling
[16:18] and for a brother-in-law
[16:23] Ken Walker he's

[16:28] now over a month and the doctors don't
[16:30] know what's wrong and he's uh he's
[16:33] looking very frail and very sick and
[16:35] they just he's he's at home sick and
[16:37] he's been
[16:39] there and we just don't know what's
[16:40] what's wrong.
[16:42] If you can ask brother Z if you could
[16:43] come bring those before the Lord.
[16:47] [Music]
[16:50] Praise the Lord. It's good to be in the
[16:52] house of the Lord. You say amen. Amen.
[16:54] Let's just all pray together. Praise
[16:56] God. Lord Jesus, you've heard the prayer
[16:59] requests. Lord, they're serious.
[17:02] Oh, this Ken Walker, Lord, he needs
[17:04] salvation.
[17:06] Lord, we pray for him, not only for his
[17:09] health, but we pray that you would speak
[17:11] to his heart, to his heart, and his
[17:14] wife's heart. Lord Jesus,
[17:18] our sister Rochelle, Lord Jesus, that
[17:20] was a believer one time. We pray that
[17:23] you'd bring her back,
[17:25] Lord Jesus. Everything is possible in
[17:27] your presence. And so we bring them to
[17:30] you in the name of Jesus Christ. Lord,
[17:33] there's different ones missing here this
[17:35] morning, but Lord Jesus, we're happy to
[17:38] be here. Thank you, Lord God, for
[17:41] protecting us and watching over us. And
[17:43] may those that are not here, may they,
[17:45] Lord, also feel the presence of the
[17:48] Lord. And may they, Lord Jesus, feel in
[17:50] their heart that the day of your coming
[17:53] is approaching so quickly that we can't
[17:56] miss one single meeting. Lord, help us,
[17:59] oh God, to be on fire for you. Help me
[18:03] to be on fire for you, Lord. Full of
[18:06] spirit, full of vi vibrancy, Lord Jesus,
[18:10] full of the Holy Spirit. We're expecting
[18:12] great things here this morning. And we
[18:15] thank you, Lord Jesus, for everyone that
[18:17] is here. And we praise your name this
[18:20] morning. Thank you, Lord, for being so
[18:22] good to us. all the those other needs,
[18:25] different ones, brother Dan,
[18:28] Lord, and and brother and sister Sophia,
[18:32] Lord, different ones, Lord, that are
[18:34] usually here, Lord. I pray that
[18:36] everything is well with them. And I pray
[18:39] the Holy Spirit would just speak to
[18:41] their hearts. We thank you in Jesus'
[18:44] name. Amen. Amen. It's good. You know,
[18:47] we were gone for a few days, but Amen.
[18:51] But it's good to be back again. Amen.
[18:53] You know, we were in a church of
[18:55] something like 600 people.
[18:58] Amen. That's a big church, isn't it?
[19:00] Amen. And but you know, on Wednesday,
[19:02] there were only half half the church was
[19:04] full, but we heard a tape for about an
[19:07] hour and a half.
[19:09] It's good to listen to a tape sometimes.
[19:12] Can you say amen? Amen. And that's
[19:14] probably what we'll do on next
[19:16] Wednesday. So, come for a tape service.
[19:20] Amen. It's good to hear the voice of the
[19:22] prophet. Can you say amen? We've
[19:24] forgotten that. Amen. May our hearts be
[19:27] burning this morning. And I believe it's
[19:29] a special day. It's Sunday. It's the
[19:32] Lord's day. Amen. And not only that,
[19:35] it's Mother's Day. So, I'm going to take
[19:37] the opportunity to welcome and to greet
[19:40] our mothers and bless our mothers. May
[19:42] the Lord give you a rich blessing.
[19:46] Brother Brandham, do you know what
[19:47] brother Brandham said about mothers? Can
[19:49] I say that I have this opportunity to
[19:51] speak a little bit? You know, brother
[19:53] Brandham said the a godly mother is the
[19:57] fifth gospel. How many have heard that?
[20:00] I'm sure you've heard preachers say
[20:02] that. Maybe our brother will say that
[20:04] even this morning. But you know, she is
[20:06] the one the the that in her in the
[20:08] earliest of our life. She's a godly
[20:11] mother. At least I know my wife did it.
[20:14] But she taught our children the ways of
[20:16] the Lord.
[20:19] Yes. Every morning they had devotions.
[20:22] She told them the stories of Jesus and
[20:24] his love. These were not just stories.
[20:27] These were true events. And they were
[20:30] real in our family. That's why every one
[20:33] of our children is serving the Lord.
[20:35] Hallelujah. They saw Jesus in our
[20:38] family. And may the Lord Jesus grant us
[20:41] mercy that each mother would show their
[20:44] children that Jesus is real. Amen. You
[20:48] know, we're living in perilous times.
[20:50] You've heard the news.
[20:53] Brother Brandon predicted, I think it
[20:55] was 1962, wasn't it? Or 54. 54, I think
[20:58] it was. He Yeah. He predicted there
[21:01] would come a pope
[21:04] out of America.
[21:07] Now, he has been ministering. He's been
[21:10] a bishop there, a cardinal in in Peru, I
[21:13] believe, South America. But he is from
[21:16] America. I believe pro prophecy is being
[21:19] fulfilled. He's coming soon. We can't be
[21:21] laxening in this time that we're living
[21:23] in. There seems to be a laxity amongst
[21:27] believers in general.
[21:30] It's not only here, but wherever you go,
[21:32] there is a laxity. We have time for
[21:35] games. We have times for all sorts of
[21:38] things. And I know that it's it's
[21:40] happening in my family. But may the Lord
[21:43] just put something in our hearts that we
[21:47] might be serious about the Lord's
[21:49] business. Can you say amen? Hallelujah.
[21:51] So, Brother Andrew, continue worshiping
[21:54] the Lord. Amen.
[22:00] You can greet one another as you're
[22:01] seated.

[25:50] do not fear.
[25:53] My God will guide you.
[25:56] He will keep you safe and sound.
[26:02] He has promised
[26:05] he'd never leave you
[26:09] or forsake you.
[26:12] And his word is true. God is good

[26:26] mine. God is good

[26:38] still shines. God is good.
[26:42] God is good

[26:49] We were sinners,
[26:52] so unworthy.
[26:55] Yet for us, he chose to die.
[27:01] Filled us with
[27:03] his holy spirit
[27:07] so we can stand and testify
[27:13] that his love
[27:16] is everlasting
[27:19] and his mercy.

[27:56] time. Oh yes. Hallelujah. How many can
[27:59] say God is good? Amen. Let's welcome the
[28:02] Lord here this morning. Say welcome this
[28:05] morning. Lord Jesus. He's good all the
[28:08] time.
[28:10] Amen. When he says yes to our requests,
[28:14] he is good. When he says no, he's good.
[28:17] He's good all the time. Amen. May his
[28:21] will be done here this morning. I'm so
[28:24] happy to be here this morning to serve a
[28:27] risen Christ. We're not serving some
[28:30] dead religion.
[28:33] We're serving a living Christ.
[28:36] Hallelujah.
[28:38] Amen. It's on. Power is on, but it's not
[28:41] working. Amen. Praise the Lord. Can you
[28:43] hear me? Anyway, my voice is loud
[28:45] enough, right? Praise the Lord. I'm so
[28:47] happy to be here this morning. Amen.
[28:49] We're missing brother Moses, aren't we?
[28:52] Amen. But you know something? The Lord
[28:55] Jesus is here.
[28:57] We brought him with us. Can you say
[28:59] amen? So, we want to praise him this
[29:02] morning. Hallelujah. Can we raise our
[29:04] hand and say thank you, Lord? How many
[29:06] have something to thank the Lord for?
[29:09] Amen. We're alive, right? We've got
[29:12] clothes on our backs. Some of us are
[29:14] dressed very well.
[29:16] Amen. And we're happy in the Lord.
[29:19] Hallelujah. So let's praise the Lord.
[29:21] Lord, we give you praise here this
[29:23] morning. We want to Lord open our mouth
[29:26] and praise you Lord. The dust we can't
[29:29] praise you. Lord, we're here to praise
[29:32] your name. Lord, forgive us where we've
[29:34] wronged Lord. We're Lord, we're so we're
[29:37] just earthly beings. We fail you so
[29:40] often. Forgive us, Lord Jesus. Our our
[29:44] trespasses.
[29:46] But Lord, help us. We want to serve you
[29:48] and we want to make it all that day.
[29:51] Every one of us, we want to make it all
[29:53] that day, Lord Jesus, to be in the
[29:56] rapture, Lord. We can see, Lord, the
[29:59] clouds forming in the skies, Lord. Oh,
[30:02] the storm is coming, Lord. We've got to
[30:05] endure. And I know that when you're in
[30:07] the boat, when you're in our soul, we
[30:10] will be able to make it to overcome
[30:13] every part of the world. And we thank
[30:16] you for that in the name of Jesus.
[30:18] Hallelujah. Amen. Praise God.
[30:21] Hallelujah. This morning, we're
[30:24] privileged,
[30:26] aren't we? Privileged. Amen. You've been
[30:28] fed really well. In the spiritual,
[30:32] you're fattening up.
[30:34] Amen. Throughout the, you know, the last
[30:38] few years, we had a five-fold ministry
[30:41] from different places
[30:43] and they brought us the word of God.
[30:46] The word of God for this end time. End
[30:49] time evangelism
[30:51] is the message of the hour. Did you can
[30:54] you say amen? Amen. The message of
[30:57] Revelations 10 1-7
[31:01] is the seventh seal given to us to know
[31:04] what all the mysteries are. Without the
[31:08] Revelations 10:7, we wouldn't know the
[31:10] mystery of the baptism of the Holy
[31:13] Ghost. We would think it is some kind of
[31:15] an emotion. It's far beyond an emotion,
[31:19] brother, sister. It's far beyond running
[31:22] the aisles. Oh yes, it is. sensational.
[31:26] It does make us run the aisles and jump
[31:29] around and praise the Lord, but it's far
[31:32] beyond that. It's God, the living God on
[31:36] the inside of us. Praise by the power of
[31:39] his word. How can we get eternal life?
[31:42] By our emotions or by our formalism or
[31:46] by our education? Is that how we get
[31:49] eternal life? No. It's by the word of
[31:52] God that lives forever. That's the only
[31:55] way that we can have eternal life. And
[31:58] praise God for these mysteries that have
[32:00] been unfolded
[32:03] in our day. Thank you, Lord, for
[32:06] Revelations 10:1-7.
[32:09] Yes, there came a mighty angel from
[32:11] heaven bringing us the message. It came
[32:14] through the mouth of a prophet, but it
[32:15] was that mighty angel
[32:18] that gave us this message. Amen. And
[32:20] that mighty angel is none other but
[32:22] Jesus Christ himself. Can you say thank
[32:25] you Jesus?
[32:27] Praise God. Hallelujah. It'll be good to
[32:29] preach here tonight. Uh this morning
[32:31] brother Maxwell. Where are you? Are you
[32:34] there somewhere? Well, he's a David. He
[32:37] can we can hardly see him there. Stand
[32:39] up brother on the chair maybe.
[32:42] Amen. Hallelujah. So we welcome you here
[32:44] this morning. We welcome Jesus Christ.
[32:47] First of all, let's welcome Jesus first.
[32:50] We always want to put Jesus first. Can
[32:52] you say amen? Hallelujah. But we want to
[32:54] welcome our brother which brought Jesus
[32:56] with him and we brought Jesus with us.
[33:00] So, we're going to have a good time.
[33:02] Amen. A good time hearing the word of
[33:05] God and then going out and living that
[33:07] word of God. Amen. Brother has put up a
[33:11] song. It's setting me free. And then
[33:13] we'll invite our brother to come. Come,
[33:15] brother. Maxwell. Amen. We invite you to
[33:18] preach the word of God to us. Now, if
[33:21] you're outside of the word, I still will
[33:23] have the liberty to tell you you're off.
[33:26] Amen. But I know you're going to be
[33:28] right on. Praise the Lord. It's setting
[33:30] me free. Can we get me? It's setting me
[33:34] free.
[33:37] This Holy Ghost,
[33:41] it's setting me free.
[33:44] This hour,
[33:48] it's down in my soul.
[33:52] It's making me whole.
[33:56] It's setting me free. Free. Free. This
[34:00] Holy Ghost power.
[34:04] It's setting me free.
[34:07] This Holy Ghost power,
[34:11] it's setting me free.
[34:15] This fair,
[34:19] it's down in my soul,
[34:23] making me whole.
[34:27] It's setting me free. Free praise, Holy
[34:31] Ghost power.
[34:35] Amen. Praise God. Brother Maxwell, you
[34:39] take your liberty and preach the word of
[34:42] God to us. Whether it's admonition,
[34:45] whether it's correction, how many would
[34:48] receive correction this morning? Amen.
[34:51] And evangelists can bring us correction.
[34:54] Amen. Brother Brandon, when he preached
[34:56] the message, many of it was evangelism.
[35:00] And did he ever cut us, didn't he? But
[35:04] the world has to be cut off us. And
[35:06] might hurt us, but we've got to accept
[35:09] it. We want to be ready. We've got to
[35:11] make it. Hallelujah. Praise God. It's
[35:15] setting me free.
[35:19] This Holy Ghost,
[35:22] it's setting me free.
[35:27] This very hour,
[35:30] it's down my soul.
[35:34] It's making me
[35:38] is setting me free. Free.
[35:42] This Holy Ghost fire.
[35:45] Amen. Amen. Let's go to the Lord in
[35:48] prayer. Amen. One more time.
[35:51] Father, we just want to say thank you

[37:12] God, that it won't be something that we
[37:13] just receive, but Lord, it may be lived
[37:15] on the inside of us, oh God. Lord, we
[37:17] just pray, oh God, may you brew over us
[37:19] once again, Lord God. You've already
[37:21] planted the seed in our souls, oh God.

[38:53] Wendy. Amen. Amen. Good to see everyone

[38:59] appreciate the invitation to be able to

[39:05] appreciate the invitation and and uh
[39:08] it's always good to be able to come and
[39:11] as to just share the ministry with one
[39:13] another. Amen. It's it's not about us.
[39:15] It's about God. Amen. It's about Jesus.
[39:17] And and he's the one that we want to see
[39:19] this morning. Amen. We have a little bit
[39:22] of a length read and so we'll go to the
[39:23] scriptures in Luke chapter 1. Amen. And
[39:26] Luke chapter 1 verse one. Amen. Luke
[39:29] chapter 1, sorry, verse 26. Luke chap
[39:32] Luke 1 26. And we'll read all the way to
[39:35] verse 28. Luke 1 26- 28. And then we'll
[39:40] go to Matthew. Matthew chapter 17 verse
[39:43] 20 as well. Amen.
[39:46] Amen. Luke chapter 1 26- 28.
[39:51] And it said, "And in the sixth month,
[39:53] the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto
[39:56] a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a
[39:59] virgin as paced to a man whose name was
[40:02] Joseph. And the house of Joseph of the
[40:05] house of David, and the virgin's name
[40:07] was Mary." And the angel came in unto
[40:10] her, and said, "Hail, thou art highly
[40:13] favored, and the Lord is with thee.
[40:15] Blessed art thou among women." And when
[40:18] she saw him, she was troubled at his
[40:21] saying, and cast in her mind what manner
[40:24] of salutation this should be. And the
[40:26] angel said unto her, "Fear not, Mary,
[40:29] for thy has found favor with God. And
[40:32] behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb,
[40:34] and bring forth a son, and shall call
[40:36] his name Jesus. He shall be great, and
[40:40] shall be called the son of the highest.
[40:42] And the Lord God shall shall give unto
[40:45] him the throne of his father David. and
[40:47] he shall reign over the haste of Jacob
[40:49] forever, and of his kingdom there shall
[40:52] be no end. Amen. Then said Mary unto the
[40:55] angel, shall this be, saying, I know not
[40:58] a man. And the angel answered and said
[41:01] unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon
[41:03] thee, and the power of the highest shall
[41:06] overshadow thee. Therefore also that hol
[41:09] which shall be born of thee shall be
[41:12] called the son of God. And behold, thy
[41:15] thy co thy cousin Elizabeth, she had
[41:19] also conceived a son in her old age, and
[41:22] this is the sixth month of her with her
[41:25] who was called barren. For with God
[41:28] nothing shall be impossible.
[41:31] And Mary said, "Behold, the handmade of
[41:33] the Lord, be it unto me according to thy
[41:36] word." And the angel departed from her.
[41:40] Amen. Let's go to Matthew. Matthew
[41:42] chapter 17 verse 20. Amen. It's just
[41:45] wonderful to read the word of the Lord.
[41:47] Amen. Matthew 17 verse 20. Amen.
[41:57] Amen. And Jesus said unto them, "Because
[42:00] of your unbelief, for verily, I say unto
[42:02] you, if ye shall have faith as a grain
[42:05] of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this
[42:08] mountain, remove hands to yonder place,
[42:11] and it shall remove and nothing shall be
[42:15] impossible unto you." Amen. May the Lord
[42:18] add his blessing to the reading of the
[42:20] word. Amen. It may have seats. Amen.
[42:24] I want to speak this morning. Amen. on
[42:27] on the people of the impossible.
[42:30] The people of the impossible. Amen. The
[42:34] people of the impossible. Amen. I I
[42:37] believe that's who we are. Amen. We are
[42:40] born for the impossible. Amen. That's
[42:42] what we've been created for and born for
[42:44] because we believe a God that that don't
[42:46] make all things that impossible
[42:47] possible. Amen. He said with you nothing
[42:50] shall be impossible. He didn't say just
[42:53] with the preacher. Amen. He didn't say
[42:54] with the prophet. He didn't put any name
[42:56] there but he said with you amen which
[42:59] means that you can put your name there
[43:00] and say that with me amen nothing shall
[43:03] be impossible. Amen. Now when we think
[43:06] about the word impossible amen is the
[43:08] impossible is something that the human
[43:11] mind cannot find a solution to. Amen.
[43:14] It's something that looks impossible. We
[43:15] can't find a solution to it. It's
[43:17] something that seems that it's out of
[43:19] rich. Amen. It seem to be out of the
[43:21] rich of man of of of mankind. And it's
[43:23] something that, amen, we realize that we
[43:25] cannot accomplish in our own self. Amen.
[43:28] That's what the impossible is. And and
[43:29] and we know that we live in a three-part
[43:31] being. Amen. And the body and the
[43:33] spirit. Amen. And the soul. Amen. And
[43:35] and we know that the the the body is
[43:37] God's senses. And the spirit is God's
[43:39] senses. And and the soul as well as God
[43:41] sense. Amen. And and we and the the
[43:43] senses that we have in our bodies, Amen.
[43:46] And the senses we have in our spirit.
[43:48] They will always declare, amen, that the
[43:50] impossible cannot be made possible.
[43:53] Amen. So far as we look at things
[43:55] through our natural eyes, amen, or or we
[43:57] reason or or we we bring them down into
[44:00] the into the part of our spiritual realm
[44:02] to always tell us, amen, that the
[44:04] impossible cannot be made possible.
[44:06] Amen. But there is another sense, amen,
[44:09] in the human being. Amen. There is
[44:11] another sense in the soul realm, amen,
[44:13] which is the sense of faith. Amen. And
[44:16] this sense of faith, amen, has got the
[44:18] ability to stand in the face of the
[44:20] impossible and say that it will be
[44:23] possible. Amen. Why? Because this sense
[44:25] of faith is not a sense of a man. Amen.
[44:28] It's not really a sense that comes with
[44:30] it, but it's a sense that is part of the
[44:33] attribute of God. Amen. It's part of the
[44:36] attribute of the God who is the God of
[44:38] the impossible. Amen. And that is the
[44:40] sense of faith and is dwelling in the
[44:42] soul of man. Amen.
[44:45] And to every man, amen, has been given a
[44:47] measure of descent of faith. Amen.
[44:50] Romans chapter 12:3 will tell us, amen.
[44:54] For I say though, for I say through the
[44:56] grace that has been given to me, through
[44:58] the grace given unto me, to every man
[45:01] that is among you, not to think of
[45:03] himself more highly than he ought to
[45:05] think, but to think soberly. And the
[45:07] scripture says, according as God has
[45:10] dealt to every man the measure of faith,
[45:13] Amen. To every man God has given a
[45:16] measure of faith. Amen. Some has the
[45:18] faith to move mountains. Some have the
[45:20] faith for different things. But everyone
[45:22] has a measure of faith. None of us here
[45:25] can say that we don't have faith. Amen.
[45:27] Why? Because we woke up this morning, we
[45:29] got out of bed. Amen. Nobody told us
[45:31] that we could do it. But it was a sense
[45:33] of faith that brought us to do that.
[45:35] Amen. So each and every one of us here
[45:37] this morning has a measure of the sense
[45:40] of faith. Amen. Every born again
[45:42] believer has a measure of the sense of
[45:45] faith. Amen. And this sense of faith
[45:48] that we have in a measure, it has the
[45:50] ability, it has the power, amen, to take
[45:53] the impossible and make it possible.
[45:56] Amen. It doesn't matter how small the
[45:59] sense of faith is. Because remember the
[46:01] scripture we read in Matthew said that
[46:04] even this faith if it's just as small as
[46:06] the seed of the grain of a mustard seed,
[46:09] Amen. It's got a capability. Amen. Amen.
[46:11] To move mountain. He's got a capability
[46:14] to say to a tree to be plucked out of
[46:16] his roots. Amen. And to be planted
[46:19] elsewhere and it will have to happen.
[46:21] Amen. Why? Because this faith is not a
[46:24] fate of man. Amen. It is a supernatural
[46:26] faith that has been given of God. Amen.
[46:29] This is an attribute of God that is
[46:31] dwelling in mankind. Amen. Amen. That's
[46:34] what the faith is. So everyone has a
[46:37] measure of this faith to do the
[46:39] impossible. Amen. But you see, as we
[46:42] said, this faith is constantly being
[46:44] challenged. Amen. By the senses that we
[46:47] have in our body. It's constantly being
[46:49] challenged. Amen. By the senses that we
[46:51] have in our spirit realm. And brother
[46:53] Brandon was saying in believing God is
[46:55] that you've got to throw aside your
[46:57] senses. Amen. He said God never gave you
[47:00] those senses to trust him with. Is that
[47:03] God gave you his spirit to trust. Amen.
[47:06] And he said your senses is only to
[47:09] contact. He says see, taste, feel,
[47:11] smell, and hear. He said, but you
[47:13] yourself is the spirit that lives in
[47:16] you. Amen. He said, and when that's
[47:19] being regenerated and the old man died
[47:22] and the new man born again, he said that
[47:25] is a part of God. He said, then you
[47:28] become a son of God. And he said an
[47:31] offspring of the creator. Amen. And I
[47:34] said, "And then you can believe the
[47:36] impossible 10." He said, "Because you've
[47:38] been made up of the miracle working in
[47:41] God, you are a part of him." Amen. So
[47:46] when you receive a bornagain experience,
[47:49] amen. When the old man is dead and the
[47:52] spirit of God come on the inside of you,
[47:54] brother Brandham is saying, Amen. that
[47:57] you become a part of the miracle working
[48:00] God. In other words, you become an
[48:02] offspring of the creator. Amen. Why?
[48:05] Because the spirit of the creator has
[48:07] moved on the inside of you by the
[48:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. So you
[48:13] become a part of the creator. You become
[48:15] a part of him. Amen.
[48:20] So the impossible being made possible,
[48:22] Amen. is not only with God who was
[48:25] veiled in the flesh of a prophet. Amen.
[48:28] The impossible is not only in the veil a
[48:31] man of a prophet or not only in the veil
[48:34] of the man that was called Jesus. But
[48:37] now the scripture is saying that by the
[48:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost there is a
[48:41] group of people that can also do the
[48:44] impossible. Amen. Not by our strength,
[48:47] not by our mind, but by what? The Holy
[48:50] Spirit on the inside of the believer. By
[48:53] the power of God, Amen. that has been
[48:56] given and poured upon the believer in
[48:58] this last days. Amen. Because today, do
[49:01] you know who we are? We are the subject.
[49:03] Amen. We are the subject. Amen. That the
[49:06] God of the impossible is dwelling in to
[49:10] continue to do the impossible.
[49:13] Amen. That's who you are. You are the
[49:16] subject that God has taken up. You are a
[49:19] portion, amen, of his own attribute. You
[49:22] were a part of him. You were a thought
[49:24] of them. He knew that you would be made
[49:26] manifest in le of the sea. Amen. And he
[49:29] made sure that when you were manifested
[49:32] some way, somehow you will come in
[49:34] contact with the word of the hour. Amen.
[49:37] Because listen, you cannot get the Holy
[49:39] Ghost anywhere else but in this message.
[49:42] Brother Brandham said it's only this
[49:44] message that will give you the Holy
[49:46] Ghost. The Holy Ghost is only found in
[49:48] this message. Why? Because here is where
[49:51] God has placed his name. This message is
[49:54] where God has placed his name. Here is
[49:56] where he is dwelling. Amen. And here is
[49:59] the only place that you can receive
[50:01] them.
[50:03] Amen. The genuine baptism of the Holy
[50:06] Ghost. Amen. So we had a subject that
[50:09] the impossible God is dwelling in to
[50:12] continue to do the impossible. Brother
[50:14] Brandon will continue on the same
[50:17] say sir we will see Jesus said now there
[50:20] is something in the Bible that God wants
[50:23] us to challenge
[50:25] is that God is an all powerful God and
[50:28] he gives his servants a commission to do
[50:31] great things is that and we mustn't be
[50:34] afraid to ask God to do great things
[50:38] because he's asked us to do the
[50:40] impossible without him now he's saying
[50:43] without him as him in flesh with us.
[50:46] Amen. He's saying without him as he's
[50:48] not with us in flesh as he was in the
[50:50] Bible. Amen. So he's asking us to do the
[50:53] impossible without him in flesh now in
[50:56] the body of Jesus. Amen. Is that so if
[50:59] he's ask us to do the impossible? He
[51:02] want you he want to ha he wants to have
[51:05] the we want to have the omnipotent god
[51:09] to do the impossible. He said, "Go into
[51:12] all the world, preach the gospel to
[51:13] every creature." And he said, "These
[51:15] signs shall follow them that believe."
[51:17] He said, "The impossible is with man."
[51:21] Amen. I said, "And we mustn't be afraid
[51:24] to ask God to keep his word."
[51:29] Amen. We mustn't be afraid to ask God to
[51:32] keep his word. Why? Because he's asked
[51:34] us to do the impossible without him now
[51:37] in flesh. But it is now what we want to
[51:41] have the omipotent God to do the
[51:44] impossible. And how do we have that
[51:46] omipotent God today? By the Holy Ghost
[51:49] on the inside of us. Amen. Because it is
[51:52] the Holy Ghost that will do the
[51:54] impossible. And I said we must not be
[51:56] afraid. Amen. To ask God to do great
[51:59] things. Amen.
[52:02] Because fear, amen, is an enemy to
[52:05] faith. Amen. Fear is an enemy to faith.
[52:09] Amen. Now the scripture tells us amen
[52:11] that that Amen. the perfect law of cast
[52:14] out all fear. Amen. Perfect love cast
[52:17] out all fear. Now brother Brandon will
[52:19] tell us amen on the message I believe
[52:21] perfect faith on the message
[52:22] desperation. I believe brother Brandon
[52:24] will say amen that Amen. that that the
[52:27] love is the incentive to f. Amen. Love
[52:31] is the incentive to f. Amen. Why?
[52:34] Because the love of God will drive us to
[52:37] the word. Amen. When you love the Lord,
[52:40] you want to be in the word. When you
[52:42] love the Lord, you want to be in
[52:44] fellowship with him. You want to be in
[52:46] prayer. Amen. The love of God will drive
[52:48] us to the word. The love of God will
[52:51] drive us to the house of the Lord to
[52:53] hear the word of God. Amen. And what is
[52:56] faith? Faith is what? Faith is is the
[52:58] word. Amen. The scripture will tell us
[53:00] the faith comes by hearing the word of
[53:04] God. Amen. So the love of God will drive
[53:07] you to the word and by hearing the word
[53:09] of God, it will bring you to that faith.
[53:12] Amen. That what makes love the incentive
[53:15] for faith. Amen. Because the love will
[53:18] drive you to the word. Amen. And when it
[53:20] drives you to the word. Amen. When you
[53:22] hear the word, your faith begin to rise.
[53:25] Amen. Your faith begin to rise. Why?
[53:28] Because there is a Holy Spirit on the
[53:29] inside of you that is going to take the
[53:32] word. Amen. And bring you the revelation
[53:35] of that word. Because faith is also a
[53:38] revelation. When you have a revelation
[53:41] of something, nothing can move you away
[53:43] from it. When you have a revelation that
[53:46] this is your daddy, there is no man on
[53:48] the face of the earth that can tell you
[53:50] this is not your daddy. You have a
[53:53] revelation. You know you were born in
[53:56] that home. You know this is daddy. You
[53:58] know this is mommy. By the way, happy
[54:00] mother's there to everyone. We love you.
[54:03] Amen. What do we do without our moms,
[54:06] man? Tell you they're so special.
[54:09] There's just something about them. Their
[54:10] touch and their ways of doing is just
[54:12] incredible. Amen. I still need to call
[54:15] my mom later, but we'll do that. Amen.
[54:19] But you see, when you have a revelation,
[54:21] Amen. nothing can take you away from it.
[54:24] Amen. And so Lord will bring us to the
[54:26] word and the word amen will hear will
[54:28] bring us fed amen and the Holy Ghost in
[54:31] us amen will bring a revelation of that
[54:33] word to be able to put that word into
[54:35] action. Amen. That's what faith will do.
[54:38] Amen. It is a revelation. Amen. Now
[54:40] brother Brandham and the message if you
[54:41] keep listening look in the church age
[54:43] this morning at church age and we'll get
[54:44] into it here. Brother Brandon will begin
[54:46] to talk about a supreme faith.
[54:49] Amen. He begin to talk about a supreme
[54:52] faith. Now the word supreme means a
[54:55] higher authority. Amen. Supreme means a
[54:58] higher authority. Now we may hear the
[55:00] word supreme faith and you know
[55:02] sometimes we may think this must be a
[55:04] greater fate of a bigger faith and we'll
[55:06] get into the quote but amen. The supreme
[55:08] faith brother Brandon begin to say it is
[55:10] nothing but the same faith that you have
[55:12] to go about your daily work and do your
[55:15] daily things. Amen. is that it's not any
[55:18] different from the faith you had in
[55:20] jumping in your car and starting your
[55:21] car. Amen. Is that supreme faith is not
[55:25] anything big or special. Amen. It is the
[55:28] same faith that you have. But brother
[55:29] Ben say it is supreme. Why? Because this
[55:32] faith amen is of a higher authority.
[55:36] Amen. In other words, this faith, amen,
[55:38] operates in a spiritual realm. Amen.
[55:42] This faith operates in a spiritual realm
[55:44] where Amen. the word of God and you
[55:47] become so one. Amen. You become so
[55:50] united with the word of God. Amen. Where
[55:53] it becomes just a daily walk in your
[55:55] life. Amen. Amen. Amen. Just as it is a
[55:59] daily walk to wake up and do whatever
[56:01] you have to do and you know you'll be
[56:03] able to do it. Now it is moving in the
[56:05] supreme faith. Where is in the spiritual
[56:08] realm? Amen. where you've been so much
[56:10] in the word that your whole being has
[56:13] become the word because of a
[56:15] relationship of love that you have with
[56:18] God. Amen. It has brought you where you
[56:21] and the word has become one. Amen. Your
[56:24] thought has become the word. Amen. Your
[56:26] walk and your attitude, everything has
[56:28] become just like the word. And so when
[56:30] you're faced with situation, when you're
[56:32] faced with a circumstance, supreme faith
[56:35] just steps on the scene and just takes
[56:37] the word and says this is what the word
[56:39] says. This is what I believe. So the
[56:42] situation will have to change. Amen.
[56:44] When you are faced with the impossible
[56:46] because you've been work walking in the
[56:48] word because you and the word has become
[56:50] one. Now you supreme faith will just
[56:53] take that word and look at the
[56:55] impossible and say it will be possible.
[56:57] Why? because the word says so. Amen. Are
[57:00] you with me this morning? And so brother
[57:02] Bren begin to talk about the supreme
[57:04] faith. Amen. That that is what the
[57:06] believer has been predestinated to.
[57:10] Amen. To a supreme faith to a daily walk
[57:13] with God. Amen. To a communion with the
[57:16] word to where the word and the man
[57:18] becomes one. Amen. Because the word was
[57:22] not meant to stay on the pages of the
[57:24] Bible. The message was not meant to stay
[57:26] on the pages of the Bible, but it was
[57:28] meant to live. It was meant to live in
[57:30] the heart of man. It was meant to put on
[57:33] flesh. It was meant to walk. Amen.
[57:36] Listen, all the prophecies in the Bible
[57:38] that were concerning Jesus, they were
[57:40] there because one day there was a man
[57:43] that was going to come and make those
[57:45] prophecies live in a human being and
[57:48] become a reality. Amen. And it's the
[57:51] same thing with the bride. Amen. She was
[57:54] prophesied to be in this age and she has
[57:56] received a message. Amen. And the
[57:59] message has come. Amen. That she will
[58:01] become delivered reality of that word.
[58:06] That's why brother Brandon will say what
[58:07] is she? She is Mrs. Jesus. Brother
[58:10] Brandon say she is him. Why? Because she
[58:13] has become the word. Because she can't
[58:16] be anything else but the word. Because
[58:18] she came from God. Amen. She was a part
[58:21] of the word. Amen. She has just put on a
[58:24] different flesh. She has put on a
[58:26] different nationality, but she is still
[58:28] the word. Amen. She is still the word.
[58:33] And she can't do anything else but bring
[58:35] forth the word. Amen. That is what the
[58:39] supreme faith is. When you and the word
[58:42] becomes a one that becomes a daily
[58:44] routine. Amen. For example, Amen. You
[58:47] you're driving your car and you begin to
[58:49] see your fuel gauge going down. Now, you
[58:51] know that if you keep going, amen, with
[58:54] that situation, you're going to run into
[58:55] some problems.
[58:57] You're going to run into some some
[58:59] situations, amen, that might not be
[59:00] pleasing. But, but you see, when you see
[59:03] the gates going down, you don't get
[59:05] nervous. You don't get worried. You're
[59:09] not thinking, "Oh my goodness, this is
[59:10] the end of me." No. Why? Because you
[59:13] have faith in a fuel station. Are you
[59:17] with me? You have faith in the fuel
[59:19] station. If I can get my car, you know,
[59:22] without any shadow of doubt, if I can
[59:25] get my car in the fuel station, I don't
[59:28] know how. I don't know where the fuel
[59:30] is, but I know somehow they've got the
[59:33] fuel that I need to fill my car. I don't
[59:37] know who put the fuel there. I don't
[59:39] know when they put the fuel there, but I
[59:41] know fuel is there to fill my car. That
[59:45] is just your natural faith. Amen. You
[59:47] You don't have You don't get worried
[59:49] when your fuel gauge is going down
[59:51] because you know if you run and drive
[59:53] into a gas station, you you got it.
[59:55] Amen. You got it. Amen. Listen, church.
[59:58] We have a fuel station and it is the
[1:00:00] word of God. Amen. Listen, we cannot
[1:00:03] prove how the word was put together and
[1:00:05] and who put it together and all that was
[1:00:07] written, but we know that the word is
[1:00:09] true. We have a fuel station. Amen.
[1:00:12] Listen. And this fuel station has proved
[1:00:14] time and time, generation after
[1:00:17] generation, amen, that if you can drive
[1:00:19] in there, no matter what impossible
[1:00:21] situation you face, no matter what
[1:00:23] impossible circumstance you face, if you
[1:00:26] can drive into the word of God, if you
[1:00:30] can drive into the word of God, there is
[1:00:32] resources for you. Amen. To turn the
[1:00:36] impossible to become possible again.
[1:00:42] It has been proven over and over again
[1:00:45] that is the kind of faith that the bride
[1:00:48] is called to come to. That is the
[1:00:50] supreme faith. Amen. Where you have
[1:00:54] confidence in the word of God.
[1:00:57] Amen. That when you're running low, you
[1:01:00] know if I can get in the word of God,
[1:01:02] I'll rise up again. When you were down,
[1:01:05] depressed, you know, if I can get in the
[1:01:07] word of God, I'll rise up again. When
[1:01:09] you're facing anxiety, when you're
[1:01:11] facing trouble in the home, you know a
[1:01:13] fuel station. You know a place that you
[1:01:16] can go and be filled up again. Amen.
[1:01:21] Oh hallelujah. That is the supreme
[1:01:24] faith. Amen. That God has called the
[1:01:26] bride. Now let me get to this quote.
[1:01:28] Brother Brandham said, "Often times we
[1:01:31] think it was almost impossible to be a
[1:01:33] martyr."
[1:01:34] Amen. We think it was almost impossible
[1:01:37] to be a martyr. Brother Brandham said,
[1:01:39] "But dare to recall that the faith we
[1:01:42] have daily, the faith that we use daily
[1:01:45] to triumph in Christ Jesus is the same
[1:01:48] faith that that upholds the polycarbs
[1:01:51] and all the martyrs." Brother Brennham
[1:01:54] said, "The supreme faith will give
[1:01:57] supreme grace for the supreme hour."
[1:02:04] The supreme faith, the daily walk with
[1:02:08] Christ, the daily walk in the word of
[1:02:11] God, the daily communion with God. Amen.
[1:02:14] He said, what will it do? It will give
[1:02:16] supreme grace. Amen. That is nothing but
[1:02:20] our own merit. Amen. But the grace of
[1:02:22] God. Amen. It will give supreme grace
[1:02:25] for what? The supreme hour. Amen.
[1:02:28] Remember the supreme means a higher
[1:02:30] authority.
[1:02:32] Amen. Supreme means a higher authority.
[1:02:35] Amen. And the supreme hour is an hour
[1:02:38] where an a higher authority has come to
[1:02:41] take flesh has come to dwell in you and
[1:02:44] me. Amen. To do what? To bring the
[1:02:47] supreme faith to face the condition of
[1:02:50] the supreme hour.
[1:02:53] I hope you're catching it this morning.
[1:02:56] It is the supreme hour because the
[1:02:59] higher authority is here. Who is that
[1:03:02] higher authority? It is Christ. In 1963,
[1:03:06] that higher authority appeared in a form
[1:03:09] of a cloud. Amen. He appeared in a form
[1:03:12] of a cloud. That is the higher authority
[1:03:15] that is here in this hour. The
[1:03:18] headstone, the capstone is here. The
[1:03:21] higher authority is here. Amen. And I
[1:03:25] said it's going to take supreme faith.
[1:03:28] Amen. In this supreme hour
[1:03:33] and the supreme faith comes from the one
[1:03:36] the supreme one who is Christ in you.
[1:03:41] Listen church this morning is not about
[1:03:44] what you can do. It is what about that
[1:03:47] supreme thing God the Holy Ghost in you
[1:03:50] has purpose to do. Amen.
[1:03:53] Amen.
[1:03:55] It is not about what you can do and no
[1:03:58] it's about him. It is about him and you.
[1:04:02] He has created the supreme hour and he
[1:04:06] has given you the supreme faith with
[1:04:09] supreme grace. Why? Because we have lots
[1:04:12] of failures. We make lots of mistake.
[1:04:14] But there is supreme grace. Amen. That
[1:04:17] is not looking at our faults and and
[1:04:19] looking at our mistake. There is supreme
[1:04:21] grace for the supreme hour to bring a
[1:04:24] supreme faith.
[1:04:28] Amen.
[1:04:32] Brother Brown will go on to say Balman
[1:04:34] Gillot
[1:04:35] is that the one thing that we we we have
[1:04:37] to move up to now is a supreme faith
[1:04:42] to what we have had. He said you cannot
[1:04:46] have the that faith until you know
[1:04:49] perfectly what you are doing.
[1:04:53] Amen. He said when you understand like
[1:04:56] brother said you just say well I'm going
[1:04:59] home. He said I'm going to start my car.
[1:05:03] He said that's all act of faith. You say
[1:05:06] tomorrow I'll meet you to a at a certain
[1:05:08] place. He said that's all a act of faith
[1:05:12] because you've just done it so much
[1:05:14] because it's a regular routine with you.
[1:05:18] Now brother Brandham said well that's
[1:05:21] the way the tents of God are. He said
[1:05:25] after you have trusted them and watch
[1:05:28] him do so many things till it becomes
[1:05:31] just a regular just like a regular
[1:05:34] routine.
[1:05:36] He said, "And that's the condition I
[1:05:38] think the church will be in just before
[1:05:42] the coming of the Lord."
[1:05:46] He said, "So the rapture,
[1:05:49] so the rapture will just go right on
[1:05:52] that way." It said it will just be a
[1:05:55] regular routine of following the
[1:05:57] scriptures and the plan of God.
[1:06:05] There's nothing we have to do in this
[1:06:07] but just stay in the word.
[1:06:11] That is what will bring the supreme
[1:06:13] faith.
[1:06:14] Amen. Is that all we going to have to do
[1:06:17] is just be a regular routine of
[1:06:19] following the scriptures.
[1:06:21] A regular routine of following the
[1:06:24] scriptures. Is that that is what he
[1:06:26] believes that we have to move up to now.
[1:06:30] that supreme faith a regular just a
[1:06:33] regular routine of following the
[1:06:35] scriptures. Amen. Listen church it may
[1:06:38] sound impossible for us to walk that
[1:06:41] way. But let me say we have been
[1:06:43] predestinated to walk that way.
[1:06:46] We have been predestinated to walk that
[1:06:48] way. Listen we may say listen I've got
[1:06:50] so much fa fear and doubt. Listen,
[1:06:54] the predestination supersedes your
[1:06:58] doubts and your fears.
[1:07:01] If God predestined that he's going to do
[1:07:03] something, he's going to do it. Amen. If
[1:07:07] God said he's going to do it, he's going
[1:07:08] to do it. Amen. If that is what is going
[1:07:11] to need for a rapture, we will have it
[1:07:13] before the rapture. How? I don't know
[1:07:16] when, I don't know. But I know one thing
[1:07:18] that God said it and he will do it.
[1:07:21] Amen.
[1:07:23] He said that is what we need before the
[1:07:25] rapture and I believe that he will bring
[1:07:26] the bride to that place before the
[1:07:29] rapture and nothing will be able to stop
[1:07:31] it. Amen.
[1:07:34] Because that is what will bring the
[1:07:35] bride to the place where she can look at
[1:07:38] the impossible and just take the word
[1:07:42] and say it is going to be possible.
[1:07:45] Amen. We are the people of the
[1:07:48] impossible. That's who we are. We are
[1:07:51] not the people that were living by
[1:07:52] sight, living by the voice. We are
[1:07:55] living by faith. Amen. We are living by
[1:07:58] the faith and the living God. Amen. And
[1:08:01] that is where we are coming to. Amen.
[1:08:04] That we can stand in the face of the
[1:08:05] impossible and say it will be possible.
[1:08:07] Listen, that's where Mary had come to.
[1:08:10] Mary has supreme faith. Mary was
[1:08:14] believing for something that had never
[1:08:16] happened before. Are you with me this
[1:08:18] morning? believing for something that
[1:08:21] had never happened before. Something
[1:08:23] that was prophesied about 400 years ago
[1:08:26] by a prophet that is dead and gone.
[1:08:33] But she was believing for it. She had
[1:08:36] supreme faith. You know why she was
[1:08:38] believing for it? Because Mary had a
[1:08:41] daily routine where she believed every
[1:08:44] word that the prophet said. Amen. Mary's
[1:08:47] daily routine was just to believe that
[1:08:50] whatever the prophet said will have to
[1:08:52] come to pass. Amen. She just walked in
[1:08:55] it. Amen. Every day she just walked in
[1:08:57] and it believing that the prophet said
[1:08:59] him, it will have to come to pass. Why?
[1:09:01] Because she had witnessed. Amen. That
[1:09:03] whatever every prophet said happened
[1:09:06] exactly the way it is said. Amen. Why?
[1:09:08] Because it wasn't them speaking, but it
[1:09:11] was a voice behind the voice. Amen. Like
[1:09:14] we heard brother Zig saying, it was that
[1:09:16] Amen. It was that angel. Amen. That
[1:09:19] stood amen with his foot on the sea and
[1:09:21] a foot on the land. He is the one that
[1:09:24] was behind the seven angel.
[1:09:27] Amen. Listen church. When we were called
[1:09:30] to go and take the book, we weren't told
[1:09:33] to go and take the book from the hands
[1:09:35] of the seventh angel. But you were told
[1:09:38] to go and take the book from the hands
[1:09:41] of the mighty angel.
[1:09:43] Amen. Take the book out of the hands of
[1:09:46] the mighty angel.
[1:09:48] So Mary, Amen. She believed the words of
[1:09:51] the prophet because she recognized that
[1:09:54] it wasn't just the prophet, but there
[1:09:56] was something behind the prophet. And
[1:09:58] that something behind the prophet was
[1:10:00] God.
[1:10:03] And he knew that God's word will never
[1:10:05] fail. Amen. And so Mary was believing
[1:10:09] for the impossible.
[1:10:11] Amen. She was believing for the
[1:10:13] impossible.
[1:10:15] And you know the day before she met the
[1:10:18] angel, brother Brandon begin to
[1:10:20] dramatize. Amen. And brother would say
[1:10:24] that that day before, amen, they had
[1:10:25] been the church on the Sabbath day.
[1:10:28] Amen. They've been to church on a
[1:10:29] Sabbath day. And he said, Amen. that the
[1:10:31] priest got up to preach and and he said
[1:10:33] the pri the priest preached a mighty
[1:10:35] sermon. But then at a certain point the
[1:10:38] preach be the priest begin to talk about
[1:10:40] miracles in different ts and the ts that
[1:10:42] God had done in the past like opening
[1:10:44] the red sea and and amen and the
[1:10:46] different miracles that had been in the
[1:10:48] Bible and the priest said you know those
[1:10:50] were great t but those days are passed.
[1:10:55] Amen.
[1:10:57] And you know as they were sitting there
[1:10:59] Mary and Joseph just having their
[1:11:00] devotion that evening. Amen. Joseph
[1:11:03] began to say to Mary, you know, Mary,
[1:11:05] you know, the priest preached a mighty
[1:11:07] sermon today, but but there was
[1:11:09] something that he said that my heart
[1:11:11] just couldn't go with it. He said, when
[1:11:13] the priest said that the days of
[1:11:14] miracles are passed, Amen. I I just
[1:11:16] couldn't believe it. Amen. Something in
[1:11:19] me said that, you know, if God ever did
[1:11:21] it, then he going to have to do it
[1:11:23] again. Something in Joseph was saying,
[1:11:26] you know, he he can't be a god of the
[1:11:28] past. Amen. him. If he's a god of the
[1:11:30] past, he must be the god of the present.
[1:11:33] He must be the god of the future. Amen.
[1:11:35] He must always be the same god. And so
[1:11:38] they begin to meditate upon these things
[1:11:40] that evening. And you know, brother
[1:11:42] Brand must say that the hour came that
[1:11:44] they had to read the scripture. And so
[1:11:46] and so brother said that Joseph said to
[1:11:48] Mary, "Listen, Mary, why why don't you
[1:11:50] go over in the room there and and get
[1:11:52] one of the scrolls?" You know, back then
[1:11:54] they didn't have the Bible like we do.
[1:11:56] And so he said, "Why don't you go pick
[1:11:58] up a scroll and we'll just read a little
[1:11:59] bit of it and and then we we'll make a
[1:12:01] way." Amen. You go to your home and
[1:12:04] let's go to my home and cuz they weren't
[1:12:06] married yet. Amen. And and so Mary just
[1:12:08] goes over and pulls one of the scrolls
[1:12:10] and come over and and said, "Well, I
[1:12:12] guess Joseph today we're going to read
[1:12:14] from the book of Isaiah."
[1:12:16] Amen. And and Joseph said, "Sure, let's
[1:12:19] read from the book of Isaiah." And they
[1:12:20] begin to read. And and it just happened
[1:12:22] that they were in Isaiah chapter 7.
[1:12:24] Amen. And they just begin to read verse
[1:12:27] one and verse two and verse three and
[1:12:29] and they're just going on to read and
[1:12:32] well when they hit verse 14. Amen. The
[1:12:35] scripture begin to talk about a virgin
[1:12:37] shall conceive.
[1:12:39] Amen. And as Mary begin to hear Joseph
[1:12:42] read this portion of the scripture.
[1:12:43] Amen. Something begin to swell up in the
[1:12:46] heart of Mary. Amen. Something begin to
[1:12:49] swell up in her heart and she couldn't
[1:12:50] explain what it was. Amen. Every portion
[1:12:53] of the scripture was good. But when it
[1:12:55] came to that verse 14, something on the
[1:12:58] inside of her begin to bubble up. Amen.
[1:13:01] It all was almost like the scripture was
[1:13:04] talking about her. She was able, she was
[1:13:07] realizing that she was identifying
[1:13:09] herself with that scripture. Amen. She
[1:13:12] was seeing herself in the scripture.
[1:13:16] Amen. It was becoming a reality to her.
[1:13:18] Now I could imagine married anointed.
[1:13:20] Amen. will go to bed and and maybe lying
[1:13:23] in bed. She's just meditating about this
[1:13:25] portion in the scripture of a virgin
[1:13:28] shall conceive.
[1:13:31] A virgin shall conceive. I wonder who
[1:13:35] this woman, this girl will be. I wonder
[1:13:37] how it will happen.
[1:13:40] This sounds so impossible. How can a
[1:13:43] virgin conceive?
[1:13:46] And of course, Mary wakes up in the
[1:13:48] morning and well, you know, it's is
[1:13:52] another morning and they have to go and
[1:13:53] and get water from the well and and take
[1:13:56] care of the daily duties and and so
[1:13:59] marriage wakes up and pick picks up her
[1:14:02] bucket and start to make a way to the
[1:14:04] well. Amen. But on a mind is the
[1:14:07] scripture, a virgin shall conceive.
[1:14:11] This is impossible. but a virgin shall
[1:14:14] conceive.
[1:14:16] And she's walking meditating upon the
[1:14:18] scriptures. And and remember as she's
[1:14:21] walking, amen, and something flickered,
[1:14:23] amen, before her.
[1:14:26] And once something flickered, amen, she
[1:14:28] paid attention to it, but she thought,
[1:14:30] well, maybe, you know, that's just maybe
[1:14:32] the spear, a piece of of a spear of one
[1:14:34] of the Roman soldiers. And maybe the sun
[1:14:37] just shone upon it and it just, you
[1:14:39] know, flickered. And and she just kept
[1:14:41] on walking and meditating. the virgin
[1:14:43] shall conceive.
[1:14:45] My, what a scripture.
[1:14:48] And she's just meditating upon it. And
[1:14:50] as she's walking, all of a sudden, she
[1:14:52] hears a voice that says, "Hail Mary.
[1:14:57] Hail Mary."
[1:14:59] The voice knew her name.
[1:15:04] The voice knew her name.
[1:15:08] Amen. And the voice didn't sound like
[1:15:10] the voice of Joseph.
[1:15:13] The voice didn't sound like the voice of
[1:15:15] her dad. It didn't sound like the voice
[1:15:17] of her mom. It was a different voice.
[1:15:20] But the voice knew her name. Oh, listen
[1:15:24] church.
[1:15:26] You have had your name. Amen. You have
[1:15:29] had your name. The voice said, "Hail
[1:15:32] Mary." He said, "Mary, you are highly
[1:15:35] favored.
[1:15:38] You are highly favored and the Lord is
[1:15:41] with you.
[1:15:43] And he said, you are blessed among all
[1:15:46] women.
[1:15:48] Amen. You are blessed among all women.
[1:15:52] And Mary turned to see. Oh, glory be to
[1:15:55] God. Mary turned the sea. You remember
[1:15:59] one time in the book of revelation there
[1:16:01] was a man by the name of John and he was
[1:16:04] on the island of Patadmos and the the
[1:16:07] scripture said that he had a voice
[1:16:09] behind him. You see normally you will
[1:16:12] turn to hear a voice but the scripture
[1:16:16] said that John turned to see the voice.
[1:16:22] Amen. He turned to see the voice because
[1:16:26] he recognized this wasn't just a voice
[1:16:29] to hear, but it was the voice of a
[1:16:31] person. It was a person that was asking
[1:16:34] and was calling for John's attention.
[1:16:37] And we know that John is a type of the
[1:16:40] bride. Amen. And there is a voice that
[1:16:43] we have had that we have turned not to
[1:16:46] just hear but to see the voice. Who is
[1:16:50] this voice? Who is this Melkchisedc? It
[1:16:53] is Jesus.
[1:16:55] We have turned to see the voice and the
[1:16:58] voice is saying you are highly favored.
[1:17:04] You are highly favored and the Lord is
[1:17:07] with you and you are blessed among all
[1:17:12] churches. You are blessed among all
[1:17:15] denominations.
[1:17:16] Why? Because the angel has chosen to
[1:17:19] visit you
[1:17:22] in a generation, amen, that is dark, in
[1:17:26] a generation that is seem impossible for
[1:17:29] someone to live the life of Christ,
[1:17:32] there is an angel that has visited a
[1:17:34] people and is saying what you have been
[1:17:37] reading that seem impossible.
[1:17:43] The quotes that you have been reading
[1:17:45] that seem impossible. The scriptures
[1:17:48] that you have been reading that seem
[1:17:50] impossible. The angel has come to call
[1:17:53] your name and say that you are highly
[1:17:56] favored.
[1:17:59] You are highly favored because your
[1:18:02] season has come to watch what you
[1:18:04] thought was impossible become possible.
[1:18:11] You are highly favored.
[1:18:16] Blessed are you among all churches,
[1:18:20] among all denomination.
[1:18:23] You are highly favored.
[1:18:27] Why? Because you have stayed with the
[1:18:29] word. You have stayed with the message.
[1:18:33] You've been walking daily with the
[1:18:34] message. And the voice is saying you are
[1:18:37] highly favored. You are moving into a
[1:18:40] season. Amen. What you thought is
[1:18:42] impossible is going to turn to be
[1:18:45] possible. The broken home is going to
[1:18:48] come back together again. The broken
[1:18:51] family is going to come back together
[1:18:53] again. Amen. Whether it be on this side,
[1:18:56] whether it be on the other side, it's
[1:18:58] going to come back together. Why?
[1:19:00] Because he said he won't lose one.
[1:19:05] He said he won't lose one. You may be
[1:19:08] looking at it and saying it is
[1:19:09] impossible. Uh but listen, you were born
[1:19:12] for the impossible. Uh you were born to
[1:19:15] take the impossible and turn it around
[1:19:18] and make it possible. Uh hallelujah.
[1:19:21] That is what you'll be predestinated to
[1:19:24] do.
[1:19:30] And you are highly favored for
[1:19:33] because you're walking with him.
[1:19:36] because you're moving into a supreme
[1:19:37] phase where the word is becoming a
[1:19:41] reality. You're walking, you feeding on
[1:19:43] it. Amen.
[1:19:48] Well, you know, Mary had a question.
[1:19:52] Mary had a question. Mary said, "How
[1:19:57] can distance be?"
[1:20:00] And sometimes we may have a question and
[1:20:03] say, "How can these things be?
[1:20:07] I don't feel like I'm living the way
[1:20:09] that I'm supposed to be living as a
[1:20:11] Christian.
[1:20:13] I don't feel like a man. I am I am
[1:20:15] walking the walk I'm supposed to be
[1:20:17] walking as a Christian.
[1:20:19] I find myself failing. I find myself
[1:20:21] sometime drifting. I find myself
[1:20:23] sometimes cold.
[1:20:25] I find myself a man sometimes a man
[1:20:27] almost backsliding.
[1:20:30] How
[1:20:32] can this be?
[1:20:35] How can I ever get to this place?
[1:20:41] The angel said to Mary,
[1:20:43] "Listen, Mary,
[1:20:46] this is going to have nothing to do with
[1:20:48] you.
[1:20:52] This is not going to have anything to do
[1:20:54] with your failures. It's not going to
[1:20:56] have nothing to do with your with your
[1:20:57] backsliding condition. This is not going
[1:21:00] to have anything to do with you.
[1:21:01] Remember, it is supreme grace.
[1:21:06] It is not just grace, but supreme grace
[1:21:09] in the hour. In the supreme hour,
[1:21:13] he said it's not going to have anything
[1:21:15] to do with you, but it's going to be the
[1:21:17] Holy Ghost.
[1:21:20] Oh glory. It is going to be the Holy
[1:21:22] Ghost that will come upon you.
[1:21:26] Oh hallelujah. The Holy Ghost that will
[1:21:30] come upon you and the power of the
[1:21:33] highest will overshadow you.
[1:21:37] That is what will bring the impossible
[1:21:40] to be made possible.
[1:21:47] It won't be about you, Mary,
[1:21:50] but the Holy Ghost will do it
[1:21:53] if you can just stay in the word and
[1:21:55] allow the supreme faith to begin to grow
[1:21:58] in your life. The Holy Ghost will do it.
[1:22:01] Amen. The power of the highest. What is
[1:22:05] the power of the highest? It is the
[1:22:07] supreme faith. It is the supreme God in
[1:22:11] a people again. Oh, hallelujah. It is
[1:22:15] him and you.
[1:22:21] It won't be you doing, but the Holy
[1:22:24] Ghost shall overshadow you. It'll be the
[1:22:27] Holy Ghost that will do it. The Holy
[1:22:30] Ghost that will turn it around. Brother
[1:22:32] Brandham says, "And as soon as Mary got
[1:22:34] a hold of Sen, the angel got a hold of
[1:22:37] her." Right. He said, "And she sent him
[1:22:41] and know it was God because it was
[1:22:43] scriptural." She took his word and went
[1:22:47] around testifying of something that
[1:22:50] didn't even show one evidence of ever
[1:22:53] being.
[1:22:54] Is that another thing? She She testified
[1:22:58] of something that had never happened
[1:23:00] before. He said, "Oh, praise be to the
[1:23:02] Lord." She testified of something that
[1:23:05] had never happened. never had a v virgin
[1:23:08] conceived. It said, but she had the
[1:23:11] angel's word and the angel was
[1:23:15] scriptural. So, she knowed it was
[1:23:18] promised and the angel had the word of
[1:23:21] the Lord and promised it. And it said,
[1:23:24] "And because she thought herself humble
[1:23:27] and lowly, yet God chose him." It says,
[1:23:30] "So, she was just as happy about it." It
[1:23:33] said, "And she went forth with her
[1:23:35] message, telling everybody she was going
[1:23:38] to have a baby before she even had the
[1:23:41] first sign of a baby." It says she
[1:23:44] didn't wait and say, "Now wait, let me
[1:23:47] feel and see if I feel any better or
[1:23:50] not." He said, "No, no, oh God, give us
[1:23:53] more Marys.
[1:23:56] Give us more Marys."
[1:23:59] Marys. Amen. That would just look at the
[1:24:01] scripture. Look at what the angel said
[1:24:04] and say, "If the angel said him and we
[1:24:06] know the angel is scriptural, we know
[1:24:09] the angel is vindicated by the pillar of
[1:24:12] fire, and all that I have to do is begin
[1:24:15] to praise God for what the angel said
[1:24:18] because what the angel said will come to
[1:24:21] pass. The word of the angel cannot
[1:24:24] fail."
[1:24:29] Amen.
[1:24:31] Oh, we don't have to wait to feel some
[1:24:33] sensation. We don't have to wait. We can
[1:24:35] begin to to praise God and testify to
[1:24:39] say, "Listen, I am going in a rapture.
[1:24:41] It doesn't matter how I feel. I am
[1:24:44] living this place. It doesn't matter how
[1:24:46] my children are. We are all living this
[1:24:48] place. Like Moses said, we will not
[1:24:51] leave a hoop behind. We are all going
[1:24:59] because we've received supreme grace in
[1:25:03] a supreme hour.
[1:25:08] Not because we deserve it,
[1:25:10] but because he chose,
[1:25:13] because he predestinated,
[1:25:15] because he elected. Oh, listen church.
[1:25:19] Stop looking down on yourself. Stop
[1:25:22] being discouraged. Listen, Mary wasn't
[1:25:25] discouraged. Mary wasn't ashamed. You
[1:25:28] know, in those days, it was shameful to
[1:25:31] say you were going to have a baby, not
[1:25:33] being married.
[1:25:36] Amen. But Mary didn't care of what
[1:25:40] people thought because Mary had the
[1:25:42] angel's message. Listen, it's time to
[1:25:45] say, "I don't care what people think.
[1:25:48] Listen, I am doing my best to live a
[1:25:51] Christian life. Am I going to make a
[1:25:53] mistake? Yes, I will. Will I stumble?
[1:25:56] Yes, I will. But it doesn't change the
[1:25:59] fact that I'm a daughter of God. It
[1:26:01] doesn't take the fact that I'm a son of
[1:26:03] God.
[1:26:10] And if God has predestinated me
[1:26:13] to be a living reality of the word, I
[1:26:16] would become the living reality of the
[1:26:18] word.
[1:26:22] Oh, you can take that Satan.
[1:26:26] Amen. Amen. Brother Brenham says no
[1:26:30] matter whether it whether it was
[1:26:33] impossible is that God can alter
[1:26:36] circumstances.
[1:26:42] God can alter circumstances.
[1:26:46] What is your circumstance this morning?
[1:26:48] God can alter circumstances. Listen this
[1:26:51] morning you have been going by your
[1:26:53] daily routine. Amen. And like Mary was
[1:26:56] going to obey the daily routine that
[1:26:57] Monday morning go to the well to get
[1:27:00] some water. You woke up this morning and
[1:27:02] you went obey your daily routine. Took a
[1:27:04] shower, put on your clothes, jump in
[1:27:06] your car, drove to church. It's a Sunday
[1:27:09] morning and I'm going to be my daily
[1:27:11] routine. Oh, but let me say to you this
[1:27:13] morning, there is an angel here this
[1:27:15] morning that is saying to you, you are
[1:27:18] highly favored. He can alter your
[1:27:21] circumstances.
[1:27:26] He can alter your circumstances.
[1:27:29] Brother Brandham says he can make the
[1:27:33] impossible become approbable.
[1:27:38] Oh boy. Oh tell church
[1:27:42] how can we lose? He said he can make the
[1:27:45] impossible become a probable. He said
[1:27:48] and not only probable but can make it a
[1:27:52] reality.
[1:27:53] He said when man take God at his word
[1:27:56] and accept his provided way that God
[1:27:59] provided for the man
[1:28:04] he can take the impossible make it a
[1:28:06] probable not only a probable but make it
[1:28:09] a reality.
[1:28:14] You might be looking at your
[1:28:16] circumstance saying this is impossible.
[1:28:18] This is what the prophet said. This is
[1:28:20] what the angel is saying to you this
[1:28:22] morning. You can imagine yourself like
[1:28:24] Mary this morning standing before the
[1:28:26] same angel. And that angel is telling
[1:28:29] you and the angel is saying to you,
[1:28:31] listen, what you think is impossible, I
[1:28:34] can make it probable. And not only am I
[1:28:36] going to make it probable, but I'm going
[1:28:38] to make it a reality.
[1:28:45] Hallelujah.
[1:28:48] I going to make it a reality
[1:28:51] because you have accepted God's provided
[1:28:54] way. Hallelujah. And God's provided way
[1:28:57] for today is Malachi chapter 4. That is
[1:29:00] God's provided way. And you have
[1:29:03] accepted the message of Malachi 4. And
[1:29:06] because you've accepted the message that
[1:29:08] that the angel has come to you to say
[1:29:11] you are highly favored.
[1:29:14] You are blessed. The Lord is with you.
[1:29:16] Don't be afraid. Don't be worried
[1:29:21] because you were born for the
[1:29:22] impossible.
[1:29:25] You are living in the season of the
[1:29:28] impossible.
[1:29:29] Because you know one thing we ought to
[1:29:31] realize church. Amen.
[1:29:33] is that we are the seed.
[1:29:40] We are the seed. Now you remember the
[1:29:43] brand will talk about the the the stalk
[1:29:45] and is it a stalk? Yeah. The stalk and
[1:29:47] the tassel and the shook and then he
[1:29:50] talk about the seed. You know if you
[1:29:52] listen to the message the seed is not
[1:29:54] here with the sh but the burn was saying
[1:29:56] we talk about how Hagar was the was the
[1:29:58] stolen and how how Sarah was was the
[1:30:00] tassel. Amen. When Ember Bern would go
[1:30:03] on and say that Mary
[1:30:05] was the shock,
[1:30:08] are you with me? Mary was the shook. He
[1:30:12] said Mary was not the seed. Amen. But
[1:30:15] Mary was the shock. Amen. Listen. Mary
[1:30:20] had to believe the word in order to
[1:30:23] bring forth the seed. And brother
[1:30:25] Brennham said that she was the shark out
[1:30:28] of which the seed came out from. Are you
[1:30:31] with me? Amen. And the void, Amen, is
[1:30:36] not the shock because brother Brandon
[1:30:38] would say that the shock was the
[1:30:40] Pentecostal age of the Pentecostal
[1:30:43] season, but out of it, Amen, was a seed
[1:30:46] pulled out. Out of it was a bride pulled
[1:30:50] out. Amen.
[1:30:58] We are the original seed.
[1:31:06] Now remember the seed had to be buried.
[1:31:10] And when it was buried and it was
[1:31:13] watered then it came out as a stalk.
[1:31:16] Then from the stalk came the tassel and
[1:31:19] from the tassel came the shock. But then
[1:31:21] the seed that went down became the seed
[1:31:24] that was manifested at the end. Amen.
[1:31:28] Now we are Oh, glory be to God. I hope
[1:31:30] you catch it this morning. We are the
[1:31:33] manifestation of the original seed that
[1:31:37] went in the ground on the day of
[1:31:39] Calvary. Amen. that seed that was put in
[1:31:43] a tomb and made his way to hell and took
[1:31:46] the keys of hell, death and the grave
[1:31:49] and ascended to heaven and open the
[1:31:51] doors of the captive that were in
[1:31:53] paradise. That same one has come down in
[1:31:58] the bride.
[1:32:00] It is the original seed again.
[1:32:07] But the seed needs the shook.
[1:32:11] I want you to follow me. The seed needs
[1:32:14] the shook. Now listen. Mary had to
[1:32:17] believe. Amen. Mary had to take the
[1:32:21] angel's word. Mary had to stand on that
[1:32:25] word firmly and believe it. And when she
[1:32:28] stood and never dated that word, then
[1:32:31] the word that she believed became the
[1:32:34] manifestation, the reality that stepped
[1:32:37] out in flesh. Amen. So you see the
[1:32:42] believer today needs to be both the sh
[1:32:46] but also mostly to become the seed. In
[1:32:49] other words, the believer has to
[1:32:50] believe.
[1:32:52] Amen. We have to believe the word. We
[1:32:56] have to take the prophet's word. We have
[1:32:58] to take the word in the Bible and
[1:33:00] believe it. And when we believe that
[1:33:03] word and our faith is not moved from
[1:33:06] that word, then that word will become a
[1:33:10] living manifestation.
[1:33:16] It will become the same one that spoke
[1:33:20] it.
[1:33:24] The same God that spoke it and you
[1:33:28] believed it is going to live that word
[1:33:31] in you where you become the
[1:33:33] manifestation of the word of the one
[1:33:36] that spoken.
[1:33:38] So you become the original seed that at
[1:33:42] the beginning said let there be and
[1:33:45] there was.
[1:33:49] Listen when he said let there be you
[1:33:51] were there.
[1:33:53] You were there. Did you realize that
[1:33:56] this morning? Amen. The Lord is just
[1:33:59] trying to to to pull away the curtain
[1:34:02] for you to realize who you are. You were
[1:34:05] there when he said, "Let there be."
[1:34:08] Amen. And there's been ages gone, boy,
[1:34:11] years gone, boy. But now what you were
[1:34:15] there, you become now.
[1:34:22] You become now, but you've been covered
[1:34:24] with this flesh that has bypassed your
[1:34:26] theophony. But on the inside of you is
[1:34:30] what was the original.
[1:34:37] The original seed
[1:34:40] has been made manifest in this age.
[1:34:44] That's why brother Brennan will say that
[1:34:46] there is a thirdpool ministry that the
[1:34:49] bride has been a ushered into. Amen. The
[1:34:54] opening of the word has also the bride
[1:34:56] into a thirdpool ministry. A ministry
[1:34:59] where as at the beginning she said let
[1:35:02] there be and there was today she again
[1:35:06] can speak the word and the word will be
[1:35:08] made manifest. Why? Because what she was
[1:35:11] then she is now.
[1:35:18] Listen church is saying impossible. But
[1:35:20] remember you are the people of the
[1:35:22] impossible.
[1:35:26] We are the seed to manifest the seed in
[1:35:29] this last age. Amen. The manifest the
[1:35:33] seed in this last age. And he has showed
[1:35:36] us what we can do. Listen. One day the
[1:35:39] prophet Amen listen he had supreme faith
[1:35:43] and he was just walking and amen there
[1:35:46] was a scripture that has been on his
[1:35:47] mind just had been on the mind of Mary
[1:35:50] and it was Mark chapter 11 amen that he
[1:35:53] was say to this mountain and this
[1:35:55] mountain shall move and he was just
[1:35:57] meditating upon him just like Mary he
[1:36:00] was going about his daily routine he was
[1:36:03] going about hunting squirrels and he
[1:36:06] couldn't get any squirrels but he was
[1:36:08] meditating ing upon that scripture. How
[1:36:10] can this be? Oh, glory. Isn't it the
[1:36:14] same question that Mary asked? How can
[1:36:18] this be? How can a man speak to a
[1:36:22] mountain and let the mountain move?
[1:36:27] And as the prophet is meditating upon
[1:36:29] him, Amen. What happens? Who draws near?
[1:36:33] The angel of the Lord who drew nigh to
[1:36:36] Mary when she was meditating. The angel
[1:36:39] of the Lord.
[1:36:44] And the angel began to ask him
[1:36:46] questions.
[1:36:48] He said, "Who do you think
[1:36:51] was on the platform every evening when
[1:36:54] you begin to discern the people?
[1:36:57] Who do you think it was?" Amen. that
[1:37:01] gives you all those visions.
[1:37:04] He said, "Who do you think it been?" Let
[1:37:07] me ask you this morning, who do you
[1:37:09] think that pulled you out of the world?
[1:37:13] Who do you think it was that made that
[1:37:14] you were born in a believer's home?
[1:37:18] You said, "Who has been doing all this?
[1:37:21] You didn't plan it. Your parents didn't
[1:37:23] plan it.
[1:37:25] Is it who has been doing all this?
[1:37:29] Who caused you to believe this message?
[1:37:32] Why is it that all users are not
[1:37:34] believing it but you are believing it?
[1:37:38] He begin to ask the prophet who has been
[1:37:40] doing all this.
[1:37:42] And the prophet begin to realize it is
[1:37:44] you. It is you Lord. You have been doing
[1:37:48] all this. And he said, "If I have been
[1:37:51] doing all this, can I not be the same
[1:37:54] one that can tell you, speak, and I will
[1:37:58] bring it to pass?"
[1:38:02] He's saying, "If I brought you to this
[1:38:03] message, and in this message is a third
[1:38:06] pull, if I brought you this far, will I
[1:38:10] not take you all the way?
[1:38:16] Will I not take you all the way?
[1:38:20] And he said to the prophet, I'm going to
[1:38:22] prove it to you.
[1:38:24] What are you doing?
[1:38:26] What do you have need of
[1:38:29] said? Well, I'm hunting here and I don't
[1:38:32] have any game.
[1:38:34] I don't have any squirrels. There are no
[1:38:37] squirrels around here. Brother said even
[1:38:38] the best hunters that he was arraigned
[1:38:40] was couldn't get even in one to say I
[1:38:42] won't go one maybe. But he said, "Well,
[1:38:47] speak it.
[1:38:49] Speak it.
[1:38:51] Speak. You want squirrels, say it."
[1:38:57] The prophet said, "Okay, well, I don't
[1:38:59] know. Well, I guess I'm going to pray."
[1:39:01] And the prophet begins to pray and he
[1:39:03] remembers. But that's not what the angel
[1:39:05] said. The angel didn't say pray. The
[1:39:08] angel says speak.
[1:39:11] And the angel brother Brandham said,
[1:39:13] "Okay." And he made a radical. And he
[1:39:16] said, "Let one appear there." And it
[1:39:18] was. Let another one appear there. And
[1:39:21] it was. And he said, "Let another one
[1:39:23] appear there."
[1:39:26] And it wasn't coming.
[1:39:36] The test of faith.
[1:39:39] let it come over there. And it wasn't.
[1:39:41] And brother Brian began to raise him to
[1:39:43] say, "Well, you know what? Two was good.
[1:39:44] And you know, it's all right. And I'll
[1:39:47] just I'll just be satisfied with two."
[1:39:49] Then the angel came back and said, "But
[1:39:50] wait, did you not say, let there be
[1:39:54] another one over there?" And the angel
[1:39:56] asked him, "Are you doubting?
[1:40:03] Are we doubting?
[1:40:05] Are you doubting?
[1:40:10] And he said no
[1:40:12] it will be there and it appeared.
[1:40:18] Now that was the wave chief.
[1:40:22] That was showing us what we are going to
[1:40:26] do. Now we are coming to something here
[1:40:29] this even this morning that was showing
[1:40:31] us what we are going to do. Amen. in
[1:40:35] this last age. Amen. But now I want you
[1:40:39] to realize something because it's
[1:40:40] important to realize this
[1:40:43] because this is not something that we
[1:40:45] work ourselves into because remember as
[1:40:48] we said it is not anything that you are
[1:40:50] going to do but it is the Holy Ghost
[1:40:53] that shall come over you. It's the power
[1:40:56] of the highest that shall overshadow
[1:40:58] you. So, brother Brandham, amen, in
[1:41:01] question of answers in 1964, someone
[1:41:03] asked him a question about the the
[1:41:05] spoken word and brother Brennham begins
[1:41:08] to answer the question. Amen. I'm not
[1:41:10] going to read the full question because
[1:41:11] the length to quote, but I'm just going
[1:41:13] to take the portion where brother
[1:41:14] Brennham begin to to kind of rearrange
[1:41:16] the question and then answer the
[1:41:18] question. And so brother Brennham says
[1:41:21] not to polish up what you said talking
[1:41:23] about the question but I believe I can
[1:41:26] make it a little clearer to the people.
[1:41:29] He says see it said you are believing
[1:41:32] because of the spoken word and things
[1:41:34] like that that he said about and he said
[1:41:38] and all of you here witnessed the
[1:41:40] squirrels and and all these other things
[1:41:42] that has been done.
[1:41:45] But I want you to notice what brother
[1:41:46] Brennham here says. He said, "But did
[1:41:48] you notice
[1:41:50] that was sovereignly given?"
[1:41:55] Brother Brandham said, "I never asked
[1:41:58] him." He said, "Lord, let me do it.
[1:42:03] Speak these things in like that. Do
[1:42:07] these things there." He said, "I never
[1:42:09] asked him that. He by his divine will
[1:42:14] came to me and said you go do this.
[1:42:20] He said see I wasn't asking one thing
[1:42:23] about it. He said Moses never asked to
[1:42:27] go down in Egypt but God that sent him
[1:42:30] down to Egypt. See
[1:42:35] so it is not something that we are going
[1:42:37] to work ourself into. Amen. But it is
[1:42:41] the supreme faith in this supreme hour
[1:42:45] by supreme grace that when we come to
[1:42:48] the time of need because we have been in
[1:42:52] the word because we are in fellowship
[1:42:54] with him that that supreme grace can
[1:42:58] come on the scene and say to you say
[1:43:02] what you want.
[1:43:06] Amen.
[1:43:07] But remember the condition that brought
[1:43:09] it to pass. The prophet was meditating
[1:43:13] upon that word.
[1:43:16] Remember Mary was meditating upon that
[1:43:20] word.
[1:43:22] That is what brought it to pass.
[1:43:26] Amen.
[1:43:29] So it is sovereignly given. It is not
[1:43:32] something that we work ourself into but
[1:43:35] it is sovereignly given.
[1:43:38] Amen.
[1:43:41] So no matter how impossible it may make
[1:43:43] look if we can stay with that word he
[1:43:48] will bring it to pass.
[1:43:51] Now I'm going to get into one quote that
[1:43:53] we've all read this week.
[1:43:56] I pay the pope.
[1:44:00] Oh boy,
[1:44:03] man. I tell you, in in one minute, my
[1:44:06] phone just was, oh boy. And it was the
[1:44:10] same code. I was like, don't you realize
[1:44:12] that someone might have sent to me
[1:44:13] already.
[1:44:16] My my phone was just going nuts. I'm at
[1:44:18] work and this phone is just buzzing. I
[1:44:20] didn't know that the PO had been elected
[1:44:22] yet. I'm just working away and like
[1:44:24] what's going on? Who died?
[1:44:29] But I know it's exciting to see prophecy
[1:44:31] becoming a reality.
[1:44:34] Amen. But but I you know sometimes we
[1:44:36] can lose the focus of the prophecy.
[1:44:39] Amen. And I want to look into that a
[1:44:41] little bit as we close this evening this
[1:44:43] morning.
[1:44:44] Brother Brandon must say acts of the
[1:44:46] Holy Ghost 1954. And we know this call.
[1:44:48] We can almost rehearse it. But he said,
[1:44:50] "I believe one of these glorious days
[1:44:52] when this united confederation of
[1:44:55] churches goes together and the new pop
[1:44:57] is brought out of the United States and
[1:45:00] put over there according to prophecy,
[1:45:03] then they will form an image like unto
[1:45:06] the beast."
[1:45:09] Now every quote I re received this part
[1:45:11] was very highlighted
[1:45:13] and it is true. It is being manifested.
[1:45:16] But I want you to notice that God
[1:45:18] whenever something happens in that way,
[1:45:22] God is going to do something in the
[1:45:25] other way. Amen. Whenever Satan makes a
[1:45:29] move, God makes a move. Amen. Listen,
[1:45:33] remember, Satan will always try to make
[1:45:35] an early move. Amen. He will always try
[1:45:38] to step ahead. Amen. He was the one that
[1:45:41] is was going on being, "Hey, listen.
[1:45:43] Hey, listen. Look at Job." He said,
[1:45:45] "Look at Job." and said, "Yeah, let me
[1:45:46] make a move. Give me the chance to make
[1:45:49] a move first." Amen. Before God made his
[1:45:53] move and brought Job out of the
[1:45:55] situation. Amen. Listen, Satan always
[1:45:59] try to go ahead. What did he do with
[1:46:01] Jesus? He said, "Listen, bow down to me.
[1:46:03] I'll give you all the kingdoms." Trying
[1:46:05] to make the move first. You know, you
[1:46:08] better worship me. Do this and I'll give
[1:46:10] it everything to you. Satan and all of
[1:46:12] us should try to make them move first,
[1:46:14] but God will always stand firm with the
[1:46:16] word and say, "But it's also written."
[1:46:20] Amen. It is also written. Amen. And
[1:46:23] indeed, Amen. We can see this happening
[1:46:25] that that this portion of the code has
[1:46:26] been Amen. It's been made manifested. We
[1:46:29] can see it happening. And and of course,
[1:46:31] we know as it has begun, the
[1:46:33] confederation of churches will also
[1:46:35] begin to come together. But the court
[1:46:37] doesn't stop there.
[1:46:39] The court goes on to say, "And I tell
[1:46:42] you
[1:46:44] the true church." Now, I believe here is
[1:46:47] where our emphasis ought to be.
[1:46:51] Listen, we it's okay that pope can be
[1:46:53] there. We seeing the prophecy being
[1:46:56] fulfilled on that end, but what is my
[1:46:58] prophecy? What am I supposed to be
[1:47:01] doing? What is supposed to be happening
[1:47:04] in the midst of the bride?
[1:47:10] And I said, "And I tell you, the true
[1:47:13] church of God will be drove together."
[1:47:20] Amen. The true church of God will be
[1:47:24] drove together. Why? Because there is
[1:47:27] power in unity.
[1:47:30] Satan has made his move, but let's watch
[1:47:32] out for God's move in the church of the
[1:47:36] living God.
[1:47:41] He said they will be drawn together.
[1:47:44] Brother Brandham goes on to say the real
[1:47:46] true believer is that Adam of the Method
[1:47:48] the Baptist prayer pentecost and
[1:47:50] Nazarene program holiness whatever they
[1:47:53] will be will go together and be cemented
[1:47:56] by the love of God that will make the
[1:47:59] body of the Lord Jesus Christ. all the
[1:48:01] believers is that an agnostic and all
[1:48:04] and and shadow minded will be cast on
[1:48:07] one side. They will go right on into the
[1:48:09] confederation of churches. Now you know
[1:48:11] we may say okay we we've come out of the
[1:48:14] Baptist we've come out of the
[1:48:15] Pentecostal and we've come out of all
[1:48:17] these things but let me say this to you
[1:48:19] church in this message there are many
[1:48:21] isms
[1:48:23] in this message there are many camps in
[1:48:26] this message there are many divisions
[1:48:29] but the court is saying that when that
[1:48:31] confederation of churches begin to get
[1:48:33] together something is going to happen in
[1:48:36] the midst of the bride that the isms
[1:48:39] will begin to become war Muslims, they
[1:48:41] will begin to break down. The barriers
[1:48:44] will begin to tear down. Why? Because
[1:48:46] the church of the living God will be
[1:48:49] drove together.
[1:48:57] That is what we ought to be expecting.
[1:49:00] Amen.
[1:49:02] There will be a unity. Amen. Why?
[1:49:05] Because in this season, Amen. what the
[1:49:08] first unity is going to begin between
[1:49:10] you and God.
[1:49:12] Amen. We are going to be united to him.
[1:49:15] Brother says when the bride get to know
[1:49:17] who she is, then the rapture will take
[1:49:20] place. But the only way she can know who
[1:49:22] she is is to become united with her
[1:49:26] maker. Amen. And when she becomes united
[1:49:30] with the maker, she will become united
[1:49:33] with one another. Because Christ cannot
[1:49:36] be divided with Christ. Amen. If Christ
[1:49:39] is in you and Christ is in your brother
[1:49:41] over on the other side, Christ will come
[1:49:44] together in one another in unity.
[1:49:50] And Satan sees the power of unity. And
[1:49:53] so he's been trying to break it and
[1:49:56] devoid it in the midst of the message,
[1:49:58] in the midst of the congregation, in the
[1:50:00] midst of the church.
[1:50:02] But we are in a season where there is a
[1:50:05] supreme faith. It's a supreme hour that
[1:50:09] is going to bring the church together
[1:50:11] into a unity. Amen. Listen. Remember
[1:50:14] church in the first Exodus they all
[1:50:17] united under the token which was the
[1:50:21] Holy Ghost. Are you with me? In the
[1:50:23] second exodus they all united. Remember
[1:50:26] in that open upper room, brother
[1:50:28] Brandham said there were Pharisees,
[1:50:30] there were scribes. Listen, those people
[1:50:33] did not agree with each other. But when
[1:50:35] the season came for that second exodus,
[1:50:39] the Holy Ghost, oh, glory be to God, the
[1:50:41] Holy Ghost anointed them all together.
[1:50:48] And in this third exodus, that same Holy
[1:50:52] Ghost, no matter the divisions, no
[1:50:55] matter the separation, that same Holy
[1:50:58] Ghost will unite the bra together under
[1:51:01] the power of the Holy Ghost.
[1:51:12] Then you watch the impossible
[1:51:15] become possible.
[1:51:20] Then you watch the impossible become
[1:51:23] possible. When that squeeze begin to
[1:51:25] happen. Amen. Listen. When you take a
[1:51:28] fruit and you begin to squeeze them, you
[1:51:31] begin to get out what is really in the
[1:51:34] fruit. Listen, Satan is trying to
[1:51:36] squeeze this bride. But what Satan is
[1:51:39] going to get is what is really on the
[1:51:41] inside of this bride. Satan is going to
[1:51:43] realize as he was at Calvary when he's
[1:51:47] put his finger into Jesus Christ and a
[1:51:50] 100,000 ft blow him off of him. He's
[1:51:53] going to realize the same thing with the
[1:51:56] bride.
[1:51:59] Oh hallelujah. It is this bride is going
[1:52:03] to blow off the works of Satan. It's
[1:52:06] going to blow off the lukewarm of less.
[1:52:10] It's going to bro blow off the
[1:52:12] depression, the anxiety, the family
[1:52:15] troubles, the divisions in the church.
[1:52:23] Listen to this quote.
[1:52:27] Brother Renham said, "So now I am going
[1:52:29] to say something to you." is that now
[1:52:32] that I haven't said all along and that
[1:52:35] is the thing that we have looked forward
[1:52:38] forward to for so long for at least many
[1:52:40] years four or five years or maybe longer
[1:52:43] the third pull has now been vindicated
[1:52:46] and I'm sure you all know what it is
[1:52:50] said now remember there will there will
[1:52:53] never be an impersonation of that cuz it
[1:52:56] can't be see it cannot be now it's in
[1:52:59] existence
[1:53:00] is that and I I I am I am warned of
[1:53:03] this. He said right at this time now
[1:53:07] it's just happened. So it so it could
[1:53:10] identify its presence among you. See
[1:53:12] he's talking about the thirdpool. He
[1:53:14] said right at this at this time now it's
[1:53:16] just happened. So it could identify its
[1:53:18] presence among you. See he said but I
[1:53:21] will he said but it will not be used in
[1:53:24] a greater way until the council begins
[1:53:28] to tighten up.
[1:53:31] Amen. Do you realize the quote is not
[1:53:33] just about a pope going into an American
[1:53:36] pope in in in the Vatican? That is not
[1:53:39] all about the pope about the prophecy.
[1:53:42] It's not about him bringing the council
[1:53:44] of churches to get him. But this is what
[1:53:47] really matters to the bride. Amen. He
[1:53:50] said, "But it will not be used in a
[1:53:52] greater way until this council begins to
[1:53:55] tighten up." And he said, "And when it
[1:53:57] does, when that does, the Pentecostals
[1:54:00] and so forth can almost impersonate
[1:54:02] everything that can be done." But he
[1:54:04] said, "But when that time comes, when
[1:54:06] the squeeze comes down, he said, then
[1:54:08] you will see what you've seen
[1:54:10] temporarily be manifested in the
[1:54:14] fullness of its power." Amen. Brother
[1:54:17] Brham said, "Now I must continue in
[1:54:20] evangelism just as I I was commissioned
[1:54:23] first. I must continue on. Therefore,
[1:54:26] you've had the word and you know what to
[1:54:28] look for, how to stand." He said, "I
[1:54:31] must continue in evangelism." And he
[1:54:34] said, "And friends of mine, keep still
[1:54:36] and just keep moving on for the hour is
[1:54:40] approaching swiftly." See that when
[1:54:42] something is going to be done,
[1:54:50] that is what is concerning us.
[1:54:56] Indeed, we can see the prophecy of the
[1:54:58] pope. But listen, church, the impossible
[1:55:03] is about to move in in a greater way
[1:55:05] than ever before. Amen. Amen. And
[1:55:09] brother Brandon will say there is going
[1:55:10] to come a time where you're going to see
[1:55:12] limbs begin to grow. Listen, that is the
[1:55:15] season that we are moving in. Amen. We
[1:55:18] are moving in a time where you are going
[1:55:21] to be the manifested, the original seed
[1:55:24] that was at the beginning. Amen.
[1:55:26] Manifested in his full power again in
[1:55:29] this last age. Amen.
[1:55:34] No matter what Satan does,
[1:55:37] the squeeze is just going to bring out
[1:55:39] Jesus. Amen. That third pull, Amen.
[1:55:44] Amen. is coming in a greater way than
[1:55:47] we've ever seen it before. Amen. That is
[1:55:50] what we ought to be looking for. That is
[1:55:52] what we ought to be expecting because we
[1:55:55] are the people of the impossible. Oh,
[1:55:58] hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. Listen, I'm
[1:56:02] going to close with a story. You know,
[1:56:04] one time there was a story, amen, of of
[1:56:06] a painting.
[1:56:08] Amen. There was a story of a painting. A
[1:56:10] painting that was made and and the
[1:56:12] painting, Amen, was was was put in the
[1:56:15] art gallery of France. And the painting
[1:56:18] was showing, Amen. was showing two
[1:56:21] people playing chess. Amen. And and and
[1:56:24] these two people, one was Satan and one
[1:56:26] was a Christian. And Amen. And they were
[1:56:29] playing this chess and playing this
[1:56:30] chess and and now it had got to a place
[1:56:34] where a man at the bottom of the of the
[1:56:36] painting they had written checkmate.
[1:56:41] Checkmate meaning that Satan Amen had
[1:56:44] had a checkmate over the Christian.
[1:56:48] Amen.
[1:56:49] That Satan had won the game of chess.
[1:56:53] Amen. And and so this painting has been
[1:56:55] hanging there and and it's written
[1:56:56] checkmate and and so one day there was
[1:56:59] one one man and he he he is he is the
[1:57:02] chief of of of of the game of chess.
[1:57:05] Amen. He he is a champion in it. And so
[1:57:08] he went to this art gallery and he's
[1:57:10] just looking at all the pictures and and
[1:57:12] he came across this chess, you know,
[1:57:14] picture of painting and and he begin to
[1:57:16] look at it and and he read at the bottom
[1:57:19] check made for Satan. Amen. And as he
[1:57:22] begin to read, you read that and he
[1:57:24] begin to read the board. Now remember
[1:57:27] this man, he he's a professional. This
[1:57:31] man knows the game, amen, better than
[1:57:33] anyone else. Amen. He's won many many
[1:57:36] many championships. Amen. And he's
[1:57:39] looking at the chess board and as he
[1:57:42] looks at the chess board, Amen. he looks
[1:57:44] carefully and he says something is
[1:57:47] wrong.
[1:57:49] He says something is wrong.
[1:57:51] The statement at the bottom of the
[1:57:53] chessboard is wrong
[1:57:56] because he said Satan has not won the
[1:58:00] game because he looked at it and he said
[1:58:04] the Christian has one more move.
[1:58:11] The Christian has one more move that he
[1:58:15] hasn't made. And when the Christian
[1:58:18] makes that move, that will beat the
[1:58:22] enemy. Amen. Listen, church,
[1:58:27] it may look like you're losing. It may
[1:58:30] look like you're losing. It may look
[1:58:33] like Satan is winning. But a champion
[1:58:37] has come this morning. He's looking at
[1:58:40] your chessboard and he's saying, "You've
[1:58:43] got one more move.
[1:58:46] Oh, glory. You've got one more move.
[1:58:50] You've got one more move.
[1:58:54] Satan hasn't warned. We are going to win
[1:58:59] because we are on the winning side. God
[1:59:02] bless you this morning. Let's stand on
[1:59:04] our feet. Oh, hallelujah. Oh, glory be
[1:59:08] to God. Oh, glory be to God. You have
[1:59:12] one more move. You are the final voice.
[1:59:16] Your voice is going to bring the
[1:59:19] resurrection.
[1:59:20] Oh, glory be to God. It is not over yet
[1:59:24] until God says it's over. Hallelujah.
[1:59:29] God has not said it's over. So I am
[1:59:32] going to believe like Mary for the
[1:59:34] impossible to become possible.
[1:59:38] Oh hallelujah.
[1:59:42] Oh hallelujah.
[1:59:44] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:59:47] Oh, glory be to God. Oh, give him praise
[1:59:50] this morning. Give him praise this
[1:59:52] morning. Go ahead and worship him like
[1:59:56] Mary did. She begin to praise God. She
[2:00:00] couldn't see a sign of the baby. You may
[2:00:02] not see a sign of your children. May not
[2:00:05] see a sign of your family coming
[2:00:06] together. But begin to praise God
[2:00:10] because you are the people of the
[2:00:11] impossible.
[2:00:12] [Music]
[2:00:15] You still have the last move.
[2:00:18] You have the last move. Oh, glory be to
[2:00:21] God. Do we know that song? Can't you see
[2:00:25] why I'm so happy? I have
[2:00:29] the voice.
[2:00:31] No. Can't you see I'm so happy?

[2:00:43] of the Lord.

[2:00:50] word
[2:00:51] that was spoken
[2:00:56] by the prophet
[2:00:59] of Malachi.
[2:01:03] Oh,
[2:01:05] can't you see
[2:01:08] why
[2:01:10] I'm so happy?
[2:01:14] Oh, I've accepted
[2:01:17] the word
[2:01:19] of the Lord.
[2:01:24] the revealed
[2:01:26] [Music]
[2:01:27] word
[2:01:29] that was spoken
[2:01:34] by the prophet
[2:01:37] of Malachi.
[2:01:40] Oh, let's sing it one more time to him.
[2:01:43] Oh, can't you see
[2:01:47] why
[2:01:49] I'm so happy?
[2:01:51] Oh, yes, Lord. For I've accepted
[2:01:56] the word
[2:01:58] of the Lord.
[2:02:02] Oh, the revealed
[2:02:06] word
[2:02:08] that was spoken
[2:02:12] by the prophet
[2:02:15] of man. Oh, let's sing it one more time
[2:02:18] to him. Oh, are you happy this morning?
[2:02:21] Oh, can't you see
[2:02:25] why I'm so happy?
[2:02:29] Oh, we've accepted that word. I've
[2:02:31] accepted
[2:02:34] a word
[2:02:36] of the Lord.
[2:02:40] for the reveal
[2:02:43] word
[2:02:45] that was spoken
[2:02:47] [Music]
[2:02:49] by the prophet
[2:02:52] of Malachi
[2:02:55] 4.
[2:02:58] Oh hallelujah.
[2:03:00] Oh we have accepted the word
[2:03:03] like Mary said let it be unto me
[2:03:07] according to your word. Let it be unto
[2:03:10] us according to his word. Amen. That we
[2:03:15] are moving higher. Amen. We are just
[2:03:17] going to stay in the word. That's what
[2:03:19] he said we should do. You just keep
[2:03:21] walking in the word of the Lord. That
[2:03:25] supreme faith. Amen. Will just bring you
[2:03:28] amen to to that spoken word to that
[2:03:31] third pole because it is a supreme hour
[2:03:34] where the supreme God has made himself
[2:03:37] manifested to us. Oh, hallelujah. Oh,
[2:03:40] let's sing that song. You ask me why I'm
[2:03:43] happy. I just want to tell you what.
[2:03:46] Yes.
[2:03:49] And we ask pro to call my man this
[2:03:50] morning.
[2:03:52] Ask me why I'm happy. So I'll just tell
[2:03:57] you
[2:03:58] because
[2:04:00] my sins are gone.
[2:04:04] And when I meet the scoffers who ask me
[2:04:08] where they are, I say
[2:04:12] my sins are gone.
[2:04:15] They're underneath the blood of the
[2:04:19] cross of Calvary.
[2:04:21] As far removed as darkness is from God
[2:04:27] in the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[2:04:30] That's good enough for me. Praise God.
[2:04:35] My sins are gone.
[2:04:38] Was at the old time altar where God came
[2:04:42] in my heart. And now
[2:04:46] my sins are gone. Praise the Lord.
[2:04:50] The Lord took full possession. The devil
[2:04:54] did depart. I'm glad
[2:04:58] my sins are gone.
[2:05:01] There underneath the blood of the cross
[2:05:05] of Calvary.
[2:05:07] As far removed as darkness is from God
[2:05:12] in the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[2:05:15] That's good enough for me. Praise God.
[2:05:20] My sins are gone.
[2:05:23] When Satan comes to tempt me and tries
[2:05:27] to make me, I say
[2:05:31] my sins are gone.
[2:05:35] You got me into trouble, but Jesus got
[2:05:39] me up. I'm glad
[2:05:42] my sins are gone.
[2:05:46] There underneath the blood of the cross
[2:05:49] of Calvary.
[2:05:52] As far removed as darkness is from dark
[2:05:57] in the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[2:06:00] That's good enough for me. Praise God.
[2:06:05] My sins are
[2:06:09] living now for Jesus. I'm happy night
[2:06:13] and day because
[2:06:16] my sins are gone.
[2:06:19] My soul is filled with music. With all
[2:06:23] my heart I sing. I know
[2:06:27] my sins are gone.
[2:06:31] There underneath the blood of the cross
[2:06:34] of Calvary.
[2:06:37] as far removed as darkness is from God.
[2:06:42] In the sea of God's forgetfulness,
[2:06:45] that's good enough for me. Praise God.
[2:06:49] Praise God. My sins are gone.
[2:06:53] Praise God.
[2:06:56] My sins are gone.
[2:06:59] Praise God.

[2:07:12] Hallelujah.
[2:07:14] Amen. Do you believe it? Amen. The blood
[2:07:18] removed every spot, every wrinkle.

[2:07:26] blessing?

[2:07:32] Hallelujah. There's one more move. We're
[2:07:35] on the move. Hallelujah. We're going to
[2:07:38] get out of here. The squeeze will just
[2:07:41] get us out of here. Praise God. But
[2:07:43] we've got to live for Jesus.
[2:07:46] Remember, we've got to be in the word.
[2:07:51] Without the word, we're not going
[2:07:52] anywhere.
[2:07:54] We've got to become the word. Amen.
[2:07:58] Because we were the word. Hallelujah.
[2:08:00] Amen. The move is on. Do you believe it?
[2:08:03] Amen. right here in the restored word
[2:08:06] fellowship. The move is us. We're moving

[2:10:04] Amen. The anointing is not the same.
[2:10:07] I've been blessed over services on the
[2:10:10] internet. I must confess I have been
[2:10:13] blessed. But you know, it's not the
