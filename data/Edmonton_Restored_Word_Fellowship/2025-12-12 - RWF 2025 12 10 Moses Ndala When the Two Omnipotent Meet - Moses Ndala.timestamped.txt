[18:14] and make me pure. You can take your
[18:17] seats.
[18:20] Go ahead.
[18:35] I've had this song in my heart to sing
[18:37] for a while, but I don't know the verses
[18:39] very well.
[18:44] Searching my life
[18:57] with Jesus
[19:00] Christ.
[19:03] on my knees
[19:06] and pouring out my heart
[19:14] to
[19:18] die.
[19:21] So here I stand
[19:24] with thisireordless
[19:48] and I want the keys to
[19:52] access
[20:01] of Christ.
[20:03] All these promises were made for me. But
[20:07] first I need to die.
[20:12] Now I'm
[20:15] fight.
[20:30] You set the narrow ways
[20:36] to eternal life.
[20:39] through prayer and supplication.
[20:43] Lord, I know the victory.
[20:48] Lord, I want
[20:52] to die. Take away.
[20:59] All your blessings are
[21:07] access. I want to do the
[21:11] works and live in the
[21:16] Christ.
[21:18] All these promises were made for me, but
[21:22] first I need to die.
[21:27] So I'm laying my all on the
[21:33] sacrifice
[21:38] from all sin.
[21:46] I'm dedicating my life
[21:49] tearing down the veil of
[21:54] Lord. I know it's all access to my total
[21:59] deliverance.
[22:09] Take away this old nature inside.
[22:14] All your blessings are available.
[22:18] And I want the
[22:21] access. I want to do the works and live
[22:28] in the
[22:31] Christ.
[22:33] All these promises were made for me. But
[22:36] first I need to die.

[22:56] and I want the keys to access. I want to
[23:02] do the
[23:04] works and liveless.
[23:20] All these promises were made for me. But
[23:24] first I need to die.
[24:26] your heart to others
[24:30] and heartache.
[24:43] You're afraid to
[24:46] care.
[24:48] I just think
[24:57] on
[25:02] a shame
[25:05] to care for you and me.
[25:12] It takes courage
[25:16] to care.
[25:18] It takes strength to sourageity.
[25:31] Yes, it takes a
[25:34] cry
[25:40] before us.
[25:47] He had the courage
[25:52] to care for you and me.
[26:10] You may
[26:13] sh
[26:31] for you.
[26:40] But the price
[26:43] is high.
[26:57] takes courage
[27:00] to care.
[27:02] It takes strength.
[27:08] It takes courage to show
[27:14] it
[27:16] manage
[27:34] to care for you and
[27:45] to care for you and

[32:06] Oh, through it all.
[32:12] I plan to depend upon his.
[32:19] Can we just say thank you Lord for your
[32:21] grace in our lives.
[32:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you father Lord Jesus Christ.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; You have chosen sometimes to grow us
[32:28] grow us through to bring us through the
[32:31] mountains sometimes through the valleys
[32:33] sometimes to some squeeze and but all
[32:36] that is just so that we can learn to
[32:40] depend upon him.
[32:42] been through this school and that
[32:43] school. We are still in that school and
[32:46] he's still training us but we rely only
[32:49] on him and him alone. And for the
[32:52] believers or sometimes
[32:54] sometimes things don't get easy.
[32:58] You don't get everything just like that.
[33:01] Sometimes you at least from experience I
[33:04] don't get things easy unless I go
[33:07] through to my knees then I get the
[33:10] result. So he's teaching me that you
[33:12] can't do things on your own. You have to
[33:14] depend on me. Have to depend on me. And
[33:17] we thank God for that. Thank God. I
[33:19] greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[33:21] Christ. Good to be in the house of the
[33:22] Lord. Thank you, brother Joseph and
[33:26] Melody and for the creating the
[33:29] atmosphere to thank the Lord and thank
[33:31] you for each and everyone coming this
[33:33] evening. Greet you in the name of the
[33:35] Lord Jesus Christ.
[33:37] Good to be in the house alone. As I send
[33:40] that quote that I was just looking at it
[33:41] and oh that's that's so good. Sometimes
[33:44] you know the enemy might come and say
[33:46] you know that service was not for me and
[33:48] that church. Why did I go to church in
[33:50] this cold and everything? You know, it
[33:52] was not even a service that was maybe
[33:54] for someone else, not for me. But it was
[33:56] good that you came to church at least to
[33:58] show the devil and which side you are
[34:00] &gt;&gt; just to give him a punch a little bit.
[34:02] And I said, you know, I'm on the side of
[34:03] the believers and whatever it is in
[34:06] store, God is helping me. Amen. Let's go
[34:10] to the word of God in Genesis

[35:13] chose You chose a way and it was the
[35:15] narrow way, not the popular way, but you
[35:18] made that choice and God was happy with
[35:21] his choice. That was also my choice.
[35:24] That was my way and that will bring

[37:16] Genesis 32:24
[37:19] 30 Jacob experience.
[37:25] Bible says Jacob was left alone
[37:30] and there wrestled a man with him until
[37:33] the breaking of the day.
[37:38] It says when he saw that he prevailed
[37:40] not against him and the angel did not
[37:43] prevail against Jacob, he touched the
[37:46] hallow of his thigh and the hallow of
[37:48] Jacob's thie was out of joint and he
[37:52] rest as he wrestled with him and he said
[37:55] let me go for the break the day breakth
[37:58] and he said I will not let thee go
[38:01] except thou bless me and he said unto
[38:05] him what is thy name and he said Jacob
[38:09] and he said thy name shall be called no
[38:12] more Jacob but Israel for as a prince
[38:16] has thou power with God and with man and
[38:20] hast prevailed
[38:24] man and Jacob asked him and said tell me
[38:26] I pray thee by name and he said where
[38:29] wherefore is it that was asked after my
[38:33] name and he blessed him there and Jacob
[38:36] called the name of the place
[38:40] for I have seen God face to face and my
[38:44] life is preserved may God bless reading
[38:48] of the word
[38:51] Just
[39:07] wonderful.
[39:09] Just want to maybe the thoughts those
[39:12] who heard me on Sunday
[39:14] there. I just want to be the
[39:16] continuation that he touched. I don't
[39:19] know. But I just want to share that with
[39:21] this evening. Come back to it maybe
[39:23] another time on another angle.
[39:27] I always marvel at the life of Jacob.
[39:30] Always marvel at life of Jacob. Jacob
[39:33] was is in the in the in the masterpiece
[39:38] masterpiece message prophet called him.
[39:40] He was the is the is the grace of God.
[39:43] The grace of God is the type of the
[39:46] grace of God. was always marvel at the
[39:48] life of Jacob because he's someone who
[39:51] was actually blessed. He's someone who
[39:54] was blessed before he was even born.
[39:57] Someone was blessed because God said to
[39:59] God told God told
[40:03] Rebecca
[40:04] Rebecca,
[40:15] "You'll have two children.
[40:17] It's not rich.
[40:22] Sometimes I can be right.
[40:27] So he told Rebecca said, "No, no, no,
[40:29] Rebecca, you know, you have you have two
[40:30] children. You have two nations inside of
[40:32] you and those two nations, the younger
[40:35] one shall serve the the older ones." So
[40:37] he already predestinated already
[40:40] predestinated to be blessed. He already
[40:42] knew that you'll be blessed and I'm sure
[40:44] the mother probably already told him you
[40:46] know what I know this is the promise
[40:48] that belongs to you everything you'll be
[40:51] you'll be an overcomer you'll be blessed
[40:53] and she was already a little bit of
[40:55] favor favoritism towards him and because
[40:57] she already had the promise so in God's
[41:00] plan he was already blessed he was
[41:02] already blessed and he and indeed it was
[41:05] manifest in his life that he was blessed
[41:08] but I also always like his attitude I
[41:10] was always like his attitudes. Attitude
[41:13] is not attitude say okay I'm I'll be
[41:16] blessed when I stay like that. No
[41:18] attitude was Lord I want more of God. I
[41:22] want more of God blessings. He was
[41:25] blessed before he was born. The mother
[41:27] probably told him that he was blessed.
[41:29] He was blessed by his father. He was
[41:31] blessed by his father. He had the
[41:32] birthight. But that that if you look in
[41:36] his the Bible, he was even blessed by
[41:38] Laban is is is a is his father-in-law.
[41:42] Father-in-law realized I've been blessed
[41:44] because of you. So you must have been
[41:47] someone with prosperity. If I keep you
[41:50] with me, I'm blessed. And he realized
[41:51] that he was blessed was blessed. And
[41:54] when when he left and he ran away was
[41:56] about to come and be really angry with
[41:58] him and whatever he was planning to do
[42:00] to him really to hurt him God had to
[42:02] come and warn him that don't touch Jacob
[42:05] don't touch Jacob because he is
[42:07] according to my plan. So Jake Laban
[42:10] realized that that Jacob was blessed but
[42:12] even in that time and after that he made
[42:15] alliance with him this is no you can't
[42:17] be against me you have to take care of
[42:19] my daughters and then the Bible says he
[42:21] blessed Jacob Laban blessed Jacob so
[42:24] Jacob knew that he was blessed but even
[42:27] but even there he was still he was still
[42:30] wanting more of God more of God I think
[42:33] it's the right attitude of a believer
[42:36] right attitude of a Christians
[42:38] Lord, I'm coming to a prayer because I
[42:41] want more of you. I want more of the
[42:43] Holy Ghost. I want I have been baptized
[42:46] with the Holy Ghost, but I want more of
[42:47] the Holy Ghost, Lord. I want more of
[42:50] your love. I want more of your nature. I
[42:52] want more of dying to myself. As we as
[42:55] we special songs, Lord, I'm more of
[42:57] dying to myself. Help me to have the
[42:59] love of Christ more and more and more
[43:03] and more. Never come to a place where
[43:05] say, "Oh, now I'm full and I'm satisfied
[43:07] and that it and that." No. Lord, give me
[43:09] more of yourself. Give me more of your
[43:12] blessings. Father, I desire that you
[43:14] fill me with your love. Fill me with
[43:17] more of your love. So that's the
[43:18] constant desire of Jacob and what he and
[43:21] then when he came and he met the angel
[43:24] and he was wrestling with the angel,
[43:27] fighting with the angel and fighting the
[43:29] prophet says at one place says a man can
[43:32] actually prevail against against God. So
[43:35] that's what the Bible says. It's kind of
[43:37] hard statement to say, but the prophet
[43:39] said it, so I can say and the Bible
[43:40] actually said in verse 28 says, "So the
[43:43] prince has thou power with God and with
[43:45] man and has prevailed." That's why he
[43:48] was named Israel. So he prevailed. He
[43:51] prevailed against the angels. He has to
[43:53] rest with the angel. You have to bless
[43:55] me. I can't let you go unless you bless
[43:58] me. You have to bless me. And he rest
[44:00] with him. And I give the title,
[44:04] when the two omnipotent meet. When the
[44:07] two omnipotent meet, a result has to
[44:09] come. When the two omnipotent meet, a
[44:12] blessing has to come. God was the
[44:14] omnipotent God. He already gave a
[44:16] promise. He already blessed Jacob. But
[44:19] Jacob in return had also to fight for
[44:23] that blessing. Lord, I want you to bless
[44:25] me. Lord, bless me. Lord, this is your
[44:28] promise. This is what you gave me. I
[44:30] can't let it go until you bless me. Once
[44:33] the two omnipotent meet, the result has
[44:37] to come. The blessing has to be
[44:39] manifested. The blessing has to come. If
[44:41] you see a little bit earlier even verse
[44:43] 10 from verse 10 as as as Jacob is is
[44:47] crying because Jacob is in desperation.
[44:50] He's his brother is waiting for him. So
[44:52] he knows I'm I'm in trouble here. If God
[44:55] doesn't intervene, I'm in trouble. He
[44:58] knew that the Lord He came to him and
[45:00] told him that you have to go back in
[45:02] your land but there is someone on the
[45:04] way. Someone who has to meet. I will say
[45:06] we have the same enemy. Esau was there
[45:09] to persecute but he persecuted Israel to
[45:11] persecute Jacob. Esau is our flesh. Our
[45:15] flesh is still there to persecute us and
[45:18] to to put pressure upon us. You the
[45:21] flesh want to kill us. But we need to
[45:23] have an overcoming attitude. Lord I want
[45:27] Lord I pray God that you help me. You
[45:29] gave me the promise of of it might be
[45:31] healing. It might be the Holy Ghost. It
[45:33] might be fighting temper. Whatever it
[45:36] might be, Lord, you gave me the promise
[45:38] and I'm standing upon your promise.
[45:41] Bless me, Lord. Deliver me. Give me
[45:43] deliverance. Give me victory. Amen.
[45:45] Amen.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; If you read a little, it says as Jacob
[45:50] said, verse 9, Jacob said, "Oh God of my
[45:52] father Abraham, and God of my father
[45:55] Isaac, the Lord which saith unto me,
[45:57] return unto thy country and unto thy
[46:00] kindred, and I will deal with dwell with
[46:02] thee." The same thing we have done.
[46:04] There is no blessing outside of the
[46:05] message, outside of the word of God. I'm
[46:08] not worthy of the list of all the of the
[46:10] mercies and of all the truth which I has
[46:12] showed unto thy servant. For weave my
[46:16] staff I passed over this Jordan and now
[46:18] I am become too bent. Deliver me I pray
[46:21] thee from the hand of my brother from
[46:24] the hand of Esau for I fear him lest he
[46:27] will come and smite me and the mother of
[46:30] the children. What a desperation and the
[46:32] prophet preached me desperation. We need
[46:35] we need a Christian need to have that
[46:36] desperation. If you have a need of
[46:38] something God let me let me fall into
[46:41] that desperation. Lord give me Lord help
[46:44] me to have I desire it with all heart.
[46:47] Don't just don't know Lord I whenever
[46:50] whenever no Lord give me I I desire
[46:54] make your word become real to me and
[46:56] that I say I will surely do th good and
[46:59] make thy seed as a descend of the of the
[47:02] sea which cannot be numbered for
[47:04] multitude. So he's quoting the promise
[47:06] that God gave to Abraham's taking that
[47:09] promise and he's applying to himself. So
[47:11] Lord this is the promise we gave our
[47:13] fathers. This is the promise you give in
[47:14] the if we can put it in our time. The
[47:17] promise you gave us in the word of God.
[47:19] Lord, may you come and fulfill your
[47:21] word. It might be for my children. Lord,
[47:24] I'm claiming my children because you
[47:26] said IN YOUR WORD YOU BELIEVE and you
[47:29] and your family shall be saved. That's
[47:31] your promise. Lord, I'm coming. I can't
[47:33] let you go unless you bless me, Lord.
[47:36] Bless me through your word. It's your
[47:38] promise. Your promise is omnipotent. Now
[47:41] I'm bringing my faith to your promise so
[47:44] that the two omnipotent can meet and the
[47:47] blessing will come forth. Amen. That's
[47:49] God principles
[47:52] says and and as we see the Jacob here he
[47:55] wanted he wanted a name changed. I want
[47:58] my my name to be changed. I want I want
[48:01] my name to be changed. I want my nature
[48:03] to be changed. I want a different work
[48:06] of I want a different might be within
[48:08] the same need for us. Lord, I I I I I
[48:10] desire a closer walk with you. I want to
[48:12] change my life. It changed my name. The
[48:15] name from from Jacob. I've been I've
[48:17] been living for like from a plant. I've
[48:20] been I've been I've been living from
[48:22] from lying to lying or this or this. No.
[48:24] But now I want a completely change in my
[48:27] life. I want something more more. I I
[48:30] can't meet I can't meet with the same
[48:33] nature I had before. No, I can't
[48:35] overcome. No, there is I need something
[48:37] greater than the flesh. I need something
[48:39] greater than my temper. I need something
[48:41] greater than than my jealousy. I need
[48:43] something greater than my pride. I need
[48:45] something that is have more power than
[48:47] the the things of the flesh. Amen. Lord,
[48:50] give me a change from the inside
[48:52] outside. I don't want to let you go
[48:55] unless you bless me. Lord, my desire, my
[48:58] determination is Lord for more of you.
[49:00] Lord, change my heart. Whatever it might
[49:03] be you are fighting with. It might be in
[49:05] the flesh. Might be your sick the
[49:06] sickness. Lord, I I can't meet it on my
[49:09] own. Lord, I need a change from the
[49:11] inside. I need just something to grasp
[49:14] you, Lord. Grasp by faith. At that time,
[49:17] he had not met Esau yet, but he knew
[49:19] from that time that I've met God face to
[49:22] face. I come this evening to meet God
[49:24] face to face.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:28] I just read what the prophet says here.
[49:31] It says
[49:33] says somebody beside he's asking a
[49:35] question what was name before says
[49:38] someone can answer be besides the
[49:40] preacher because there was a preacher
[49:41] was to raise his hand say no not then
[49:43] someone says yeah says Jacob yeah that's
[49:46] right Jacob before his name was changed
[49:49] what caused him to receive his spiritual
[49:50] name somebody says something brother
[49:52] says prevail with the angel prevail with
[49:54] the angel and rise with him and said
[49:57] I'll not let you go until you bless me
[50:00] You want a spiritual name tonight? Just
[50:03] get a hold of the Holy Spirit and say,
[50:05] "Lord, I'm not going to leave this
[50:08] tabernacle till you bless me. Things
[50:11] will look different when you leave."
[50:14] Says, "You be just as determined as
[50:17] Jacob was, you will be you will get a
[50:20] blessing." Oh God, help us to be more
[50:22] determined. Lord,
[50:25] watch. He touched his his thigh and
[50:27] Jacob walked different. Amen. I hope
[50:29] that goes way down home. When you
[50:31] wrestle with God, you will walk
[50:34] different after that. Watch. See on the
[50:38] other side of the brookie, the little
[50:39] river, he was a strong great man,
[50:42] backsliden though, away from God,
[50:44] running from his brother, running from
[50:45] God, and stout and sturdy. On the other
[50:49] side of the brook, a limping prince. The
[50:52] heart a prince before God. For you have
[50:54] power with God as a prince. A limping
[50:57] prince. And he limped all of his life.
[51:00] Oh, how God does things. Isn't that
[51:03] marvelous? Isn't he marvelous? On the
[51:05] other side, he was a great man, but
[51:07] inside empty, but on the other side, he
[51:09] looked like he was weak on the flesh,
[51:11] but great from the inside because he met
[51:14] the angel. We want a conference with
[51:17] God. Every time we come to a prayer
[51:19] meeting, it's a conference with God.
[51:22] It's the same at the same level as Jacob
[51:25] was meeting the angel there. That the
[51:27] same attitude we are coming with to the
[51:29] prayer meeting. Lord, I want to meet
[51:32] you, Lord. And I I I'm expecting a
[51:35] blessing from you, Lord. I might not see
[51:37] it right away, but I know that you'll
[51:39] bless me. I'm coming with expectation.
[51:42] And I'm coming, Father, with that hunger
[51:44] in my heart, Lord, for more of you.
[51:46] Lord, I can't let you go unless you
[51:48] bless me, Lord. Bless me. Glory to God.
[51:53] We need that desper that determination.
[51:56] We need that desperation. We need that
[51:58] determination. I like that the story of
[52:01] of a of the determination of the
[52:03] Shunomite woman with Elisha. She came to
[52:06] Elisha and said, "No, Elisha, I know you
[52:09] gave. First of all, I didn't even ask
[52:11] for this boy. I didn't ask for the
[52:13] child. But I she she had she saw a need
[52:16] for the prophet. She responded to the
[52:17] need. Amen. Sometimes brothers in India,
[52:22] God has needs as well. God has needs.
[52:25] Times only my needs. But God also has
[52:28] needs. And most the secret sometimes to
[52:31] our the to get the result to our needs
[52:33] is to supply to God's need. When you
[52:36] supply to God's need, your answer will
[52:38] be found in God's need without knowing.
[52:41] Sometimes you just do do it selfishly.
[52:44] Selfishness. I don't put it in English
[52:46] word. Self selfless. Selfish.
[52:52] You understand what I mean? Selfishly.
[52:57] Okay. You understand what I mean? So as
[52:59] you do it, God inside of it, God will
[53:02] answer to your need. As you supply to
[53:05] God need, God will answer to your need.
[53:07] Actually, it's one of the good service
[53:09] there and I was a little bit more
[53:11] emotion on that. But one but it was very
[53:14] good. So as she she as she as she gave
[53:18] that to the prophet I just want that
[53:20] room and then the prophet asked
[53:24] Elisha what is her need now? It's not
[53:26] her need. She has no children and
[53:29] prophet says that it will be given to
[53:31] her without even her asking. But because
[53:34] she supplied to the need of God and God
[53:36] supplied to her need and then she had
[53:38] that child. Amen. After many years and
[53:40] then another that child died then she
[53:43] had to come again back to the prophet
[53:45] came back to the prophet and prophet and
[53:48] she prophet will dramatize it and she it
[53:50] was not like everything was quiet and at
[53:52] home there was a tum husband crying and
[53:55] people coming to check and everything
[53:57] but she decided to go and meet the
[53:59] prophet. In other words, she goes to
[54:00] have a conference with God. type of
[54:03] having a conference with God. I'm going
[54:05] to go find a conference with God.
[54:08] Sometimes the problem where we have is
[54:09] when we have problem at home and
[54:11] everything, we stay at home with the
[54:12] problems. No, you need to go and find
[54:15] God, have conference with God. And when
[54:18] she came and have conference with God,
[54:21] she was determined to meet the prophet.
[54:23] The type meet God. And as she met God,
[54:26] the prophet asked them, "What is
[54:28] everything all right?" She says, "All is
[54:31] well. All is well. Even though through
[54:34] the trials, even though through
[54:36] difficult things, but all is well. How
[54:38] can you say all is well? Positive
[54:40] confession as we heard on Sunday.
[54:42] Positive confession because I'm in the
[54:45] presence of God. All is well. He knows
[54:48] the situation. He knows what I'm going
[54:50] through. And she came and asked the
[54:52] prophet, "This is what has happened.
[54:53] This is what happened in my family. This
[54:54] is what happened. I want you to come
[54:56] with me." And the prophet says, "No, you
[54:58] can go with my staff. You can go with my
[55:00] servant." said, "No, I can't rely on the
[55:02] staff. I can't rely on the ser. I want
[55:04] to you. I won't let you go unless you
[55:07] come with me." The same thing, the same
[55:09] attitude. We're coming to God. We are
[55:10] coming to you. You gave us the promise
[55:12] in the word of God. We are coming to
[55:14] you, Lord. We will not let you go unless
[55:17] you go with us. Lord,
[55:19] &gt;&gt; we are not leaving you in church. YOU
[55:21] ARE GOING WITH US, BROTHER. In our home,
[55:23] in our situation, IN OUR PROBLEMS THERE,
[55:26] GOD, YOU'LL GO WITH US. We are not
[55:28] leaving you in church but we go all the
[55:30] way with you.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Determination when that omnipotent met
[55:35] the other omnipotent the blessings was
[55:37] there.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Prophet says in
[55:44] he says I do think that there were
[55:47] talking about her that said the woman's
[55:49] faith wasn't in the staff it was in the
[55:51] prophet and I like her determination.
[55:54] She said, "As the Lord lives and your
[55:57] soul never dies, I'll not leave you."
[56:01] That was attitude. Then prophet, if we
[56:03] tonight could hold on God's
[56:06] representative like that, if we could
[56:08] tell the Holy Spirit tonight, as sure as
[56:11] you are, the immortal spirit of God, you
[56:14] give me a promise in the Bible of my
[56:17] healing, I'm going to hold on till I see
[56:21] something happen.
[56:23] So there will be miracles taking place.
[56:25] The prophet says the lame will be
[56:27] jumping and running. The doctors of Los
[56:29] Angeles will be surprised tomorrow to
[56:32] see the patient healed. And well, if we
[56:34] could just take a hold of God's agent.
[56:38] God's agent then was Elisha. God's agent
[56:41] today is the Holy Spirit. Hold on to it.
[56:45] When you have a come in contact and you
[56:47] feel the Holy Spirit on you, then hold
[56:49] on to it. I'll not leave you. stay with
[56:52] it like Jacob did when he wrestled with
[56:54] the angel. I'm not going I'm going to
[56:57] hold on till you bless me. Give me the
[57:00] thing that I'm desiring. See, would it
[57:02] be a wonderful would would it be a
[57:06] wonderful revival break out in Los
[57:08] Angeles temple and all up and down the
[57:10] coast here if the people that right here
[57:13] tonight and those that are listening on
[57:16] in the air will take that attitude
[57:18] towards the Holy Spirit tonight.
[57:22] I'm going to stay with you until I find
[57:24] out the things that I want to know. And
[57:26] Elisha seen that he had her on her
[57:29] hands. There was nothing else to go to
[57:32] do but to go with her. If you'll just
[57:35] stay with the Holy Spirit, stay on his
[57:37] hands. He He loved you. Listen to this.
[57:41] So, if you'll just stay with the Holy
[57:43] Spirit, stay on his hands. He loved you
[57:46] well enough to come to you and bless you
[57:48] and save you. Then stay on his hands.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Don't let him go. Stay on his hands.
[57:55] Don't you remember Jesus teaching about
[57:56] the unjust judge? How he said, "I fear
[57:59] neither man nor man, but the woman
[58:01] torment me day and night crying after
[58:03] me." How much more will God give them
[58:06] the Holy Spirit to cry after him day and
[58:08] night? So stay on his hands. So we got
[58:12] faith to believe that God can do it and
[58:14] will do it. He let take a hold of it and
[58:17] hold on. Just don't let it go and stay
[58:21] right with it. Just don't let it let it
[58:23] go. Stay right with it. If it doesn't
[58:26] come now, it will come 10 minutes later,
[58:28] hour later, two weeks later, one month
[58:31] later, no matter when it comes, it's got
[58:34] a hold and I'm going to stay with it.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; That's what we are going to do in this
[58:39] prayer. Lord, we are staying with your
[58:41] promise. We are staying with your word.
[58:42] We are determined. God is determined to
[58:45] bless us. Remember Jacob, he already
[58:48] blessed before he was even born. So God
[58:49] is determined to bless us. Now it's our
[58:52] side now to be determined to receive the
[58:55] blessing of God. We are so determined.
[58:57] We are not giving up. We keep moving on.
[58:59] Amen. Oh God, I don't see today, but I
[59:02] stay with you, Lord. I will come and
[59:04] praising you. I'll come and testify
[59:06] about you. I will be SAYING ALL IS WELL
[59:09] BY GOD'S GRACE. I'm healed. I'm saved.
[59:12] I'm filled with the Holy Ghost. I HAVE A
[59:14] VICTORY VICTORIOUS LIFE. MY CHILDREN ARE
[59:16] SAVED. I'm healed. Oh God, whatever have
[59:19] need of I have need of a job. GOD WILL
[59:21] PROVIDE A JOB. WHATEVER IT IS NEED,
[59:24] WHATEVER IT IS, GOD IS IN CONTROL OF
[59:26] EVERY SITUATION. He's determined. Now
[59:29] let us be determined.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Martha was in a situation a very
[59:34] very that's why I will read that quote
[59:37] of the tomb important she was in a very
[59:40] difficult situation she has been calling
[59:43] upon the Lord Jesus Christ your friend
[59:45] Lazarus he is very sick he's very sick
[59:48] and she's calling upon him she's calling
[59:50] upon him but the the more he heard about
[59:54] the calling the more he looked like he
[59:56] was going further and further and
[59:58] further she humanly speaking she could
[1:00:01] have been discouraged But this is the
[1:00:02] man we have been supporting. This is the
[1:00:04] one. But how come we all the reproach we
[1:00:09] we bore because of him. But how come in
[1:00:12] this time of distress is not coming to
[1:00:14] us. Why? Why? Humanly speaking many
[1:00:17] thoughts and and people criticizing our
[1:00:20] people and this is the church you go
[1:00:22] through. Look now your pastor is gone.
[1:00:24] He doesn't care. What what kind of man
[1:00:28] is that? Not even a little bit of
[1:00:30] compassion, many criticism. Just come
[1:00:33] back to our organization. We took care
[1:00:35] we have social thing
[1:00:38] many oppression upon her. But then
[1:00:41] finally on the other side, God was
[1:00:44] working something. Jesus already had the
[1:00:46] answer. He already knew that and he said
[1:00:49] this death is not going to bring to this
[1:00:52] this sickness is not going to bring unto
[1:00:53] death. means he already knew he already
[1:00:55] he already there was already one
[1:00:57] omnipotence on the one side is already
[1:01:00] there it was already the result God
[1:01:02] speaking way in the way of God it was
[1:01:04] already have a a positive result but on
[1:01:07] the other side God was working now with
[1:01:10] ma was making ma making m on the other
[1:01:14] side now she had to reach also the level
[1:01:16] of faith that she could meet the result
[1:01:18] that was already in God's hand now on
[1:01:21] the other side and then then
[1:01:24] the place where we can say now it's over
[1:01:27] because he died there's a lie now it's
[1:01:29] over and everything now now now it's
[1:01:31] just let try to handle situation humanly
[1:01:34] speaking and then he come the Lord Jesus
[1:01:36] Christ come he come in the darkest hours
[1:01:39] always comes in the darkest hours
[1:01:42] sometimes where we have lost every hope
[1:01:44] then he comes we thank God when he comes
[1:01:47] at his own appointed time but he will
[1:01:50] come every time you call him he will
[1:01:53] Amen. And he came and he came and now
[1:01:55] she comes to him. Oh master, if you had
[1:01:58] been here, our brother would have not
[1:02:00] died. If he had been here, he would have
[1:02:02] not died. But says the Lord, but he will
[1:02:05] be raised. He will be raised. And she
[1:02:07] thought it would be on the other time at
[1:02:09] the end of the days and the end of time.
[1:02:12] I know you are at the end of time. He
[1:02:14] say, I'm the life and the resurrection.
[1:02:16] Today I am the great I am. Is still the
[1:02:19] great I AM TODAY. IS THE PRESENT TIMES.
[1:02:22] Praise God. He's still here. He's still
[1:02:25] a high priest who can be touched by the
[1:02:27] feeling of our infirmities. He's real.
[1:02:29] He's not the God of the past. He's not
[1:02:31] always God of the future. He's the God
[1:02:32] of the present time.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER HOW DARK THE situation is,
[1:02:36] he's still God.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Present times
[1:02:40] read and you know the end result. Now
[1:02:43] the prophet is that's what he's reading.
[1:02:45] He says have been here my brother would
[1:02:47] have not died. and said even now
[1:02:49] whatever you ask God God will give it to
[1:02:52] you.
[1:02:55] That's the attitude. Even now
[1:02:58] uncertain about that. See that's when
[1:03:01] two positives meet. See that's when two
[1:03:04] omnipotent meet. When one omnipotent she
[1:03:08] had she had perfect omnipotent faith in
[1:03:11] Christ and Christ was omnipotent. See,
[1:03:15] she had perfect infinite faith in Christ
[1:03:18] that he was the Lord and knowing
[1:03:21] whatever he asked God, God will give it
[1:03:23] to him. In other words, she said if you
[1:03:26] just speak the word, that's all I have
[1:03:27] to do. Whatever you ask God, God will
[1:03:30] give it to you. Amen. Says that
[1:03:32] omnipotent all powerful because he just
[1:03:35] said so. Says all right, it was all
[1:03:37] powerful. says now when the TWO POWERS
[1:03:40] THE TWO OMNIPOTENT powers meet together
[1:03:43] it's a contact then amen something has
[1:03:46] to happen God has promised now ask let
[1:03:49] us come with that omnipotent faith just
[1:03:52] believing what God says and and and
[1:03:55] praying upon what God said amen says
[1:04:00] the contact then when a line here has
[1:04:02] got 150 volt this one got 150 volt When
[1:04:08] they come together, you got 150 volt
[1:04:11] both ways. Says, see, when you got
[1:04:14] supreme power, when Jesus said, "Lay
[1:04:17] hands on the sick, they shall recover."
[1:04:19] And you got supreme faith in that being
[1:04:21] the truth, you need a supreme God that
[1:04:25] make a supreme promise and a supreme
[1:04:28] result will come. I believe supreme
[1:04:31] result will come when our faith meets
[1:04:34] the supreme word of God. When we have
[1:04:36] supreme faith and we have THE SUPREME
[1:04:38] WORD OF GOD, IT WILL BRING supreme
[1:04:41] result. Despite the circumstances,
[1:04:43] despite the situations, despite how dark
[1:04:46] it is, it's still real. Amen. Now the
[1:04:49] message says when what happens when two
[1:04:52] omnipotent meet, when God and man comes
[1:04:54] together to omnipotent, something that
[1:04:56] got to shake whatever you'd said with
[1:04:59] that creative power of omnipotence of
[1:05:02] God knowing that he has promised it. If
[1:05:05] God has promised and you come and
[1:05:07] pronounce it, amen says that creative
[1:05:09] power of omnipotence. God said he said
[1:05:12] it in his word, it creates a power that
[1:05:14] goes out yonder and brings things to
[1:05:17] pass things that is not. It makes them
[1:05:20] as though they are because two
[1:05:22] omnipotent has met.
[1:05:25] Remember that Sir Phoenician woman as
[1:05:29] she was there and she came and she had a
[1:05:30] lot of struggles, a lot of hindrances, a
[1:05:33] lot of obstacles, but she was trying to
[1:05:35] meet the omnipotent one. She had the
[1:05:38] omnipotent faith, she had to meet the
[1:05:40] omnipotent God. Amen. And then when she
[1:05:42] met the omnipotent God, despite the
[1:05:44] struggle, despite the despite the the
[1:05:47] hindrances, despite the obstacles, the
[1:05:50] omnipotent God says, "Let it be done to
[1:05:52] you according to thy faith." because of
[1:05:55] thy saying, because of thy confession,
[1:05:58] because of saying the creative power of
[1:06:00] God. God, I even want even the crumbs, I
[1:06:04] just want that. If you the crumbs you
[1:06:06] have for me, I will go for the crumbs,
[1:06:08] Lord. Even you call me call me dog. Oh
[1:06:11] Lord, I accept THAT. WHATEVER THE WORD
[1:06:13] OF GOD SAYS, I accept it. But I just
[1:06:15] accept your word and I'm coming because
[1:06:18] I want to meet the omnipotent. And the
[1:06:20] omnipotent gave her the desire of her
[1:06:22] heart. How many want to meet the
[1:06:24] important this night? Lord, I want more.
[1:06:26] I want more. I want more. I want more.
[1:06:29] Elisha that he had the same attitude.
[1:06:31] Elisha, Lord, God, I desire the I desire
[1:06:35] the double portion.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; The prophet says it's actually a hard
[1:06:38] things to ask. It's a very hard things
[1:06:41] to ask. Then prophet put comments on.
[1:06:44] Don't be scared of asking God hard
[1:06:47] things. He actually likes to be asked
[1:06:50] the hard things. It means you trust in
[1:06:52] his omnipotence power that he can do the
[1:06:56] hard things humanly speaking. When it
[1:06:58] look like impossible, ask those hard
[1:07:01] things. God is more than able to perform
[1:07:04] that and give you the desire of your
[1:07:06] heart. Amen. Praise be to God. Do you
[1:07:09] love the Lord?
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Thank God for your grace and mercy.
[1:07:18] That's the attitude we are going to
[1:07:19] have. Lord,
[1:07:21] Sister Wendy's coming. Prophet says in
[1:07:24] prayer, if there is those here tonight
[1:07:26] who are not saved, may they hold on
[1:07:29] until the saving grace of God has
[1:07:32] received them. If they are here without
[1:07:34] the baptism of the Holy Spirit, may they
[1:07:36] be like that little woman, let not time
[1:07:39] or anything else that stand in the way.
[1:07:42] They will hold. They will hold and be
[1:07:44] perseverant until the spirit fills their
[1:07:47] life with the grace of God. If they are
[1:07:49] sick, may they not let loose. May they
[1:07:52] hold like Jacob, how perseverant he was.
[1:07:55] He held on and said, "I'll not let you
[1:07:58] go until you bless me." That blessing
[1:08:01] meant life to him. So does it mean to us
[1:08:04] tonight. Healing means healing means
[1:08:07] life to us, Lord. We pray that your
[1:08:09] presence will come and will be able to
[1:08:11] get a hold of you and get a hold of us
[1:08:15] like you did for Jacob. that rest.
[1:08:18] I will not let you go until you bless
[1:08:21] me. Amen.
[1:08:27] All is well. All is well. The message
[1:08:32] needs raise your hand
[1:08:35] to address the need.
[1:08:42] All is well.
[1:08:48] All
[1:08:50] is well.
[1:08:55] For we have heard the message shalom.
[1:09:03] All is well.
[1:09:08] Oh, there is a place of perfect
[1:09:14] rest behind
[1:09:17] the
[1:09:19] end.
[1:09:23] rest
[1:09:24] of
[1:09:27] all
[1:09:29] is well.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; One more time. All is well. All
[1:09:35] is well.
[1:09:38] All is well.
[1:09:40] All is well.
[1:09:46] Oh, we
[1:09:51] shalom
[1:09:54] is
[1:09:56] shalom to the bride.
[1:09:58] Shalom to the elect.
[1:10:00] There is a place
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; behind
[1:10:08] the
[1:10:13] rest.
[1:10:25] Is there any that you like to express it
[1:10:27] publicly?
[1:16:57] Certainly a need
[1:17:01] stress
[1:17:03] nervous stress.
[1:19:03] Praise God.

[1:22:49] is still

[1:23:01] when we go home just remember the sister
[1:23:04] remember the brother family and we
[1:23:07] continue that because we are not going

[1:35:06] Jesus Christ. Amen.

[1:35:11] pray for us this evening just to close
[1:35:14] service. Bring all the needs

[1:35:35] about the blood. We need the blood.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1:35:42] We need the life of the blood. The Holy
[1:35:44] Spirit in our life to guide us and to
[1:35:46] lead us into all truth.
[1:35:50] Lord Jesus, we thank you tonight that
[1:35:52] we're able to gather together
[1:35:55] as a family of God worshiping you, the
[1:35:58] great God of the universe,
[1:36:00] our great savior, our greatest Lord,
[1:36:03] provider.
[1:36:05] Lord, you heard all the different
[1:36:07] requests, Lord.
[1:36:09] Lord, you heard
[1:36:11] brother's
[1:36:14] son.
[1:36:16] Lord,
[1:36:17] Lord, he's sick. Lord, I pray that you
[1:36:19] would touch him and heal him.
[1:36:22] You heard about his grandson. Lord,
[1:36:26] Lord, touch him his life. Lord, we have
[1:36:28] family and we are concerned about them.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we thank you that you care
[1:36:35] for everyone.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; You care, Lord God, for Brianna, our
[1:36:39] sister Wendy's daughter. Lord,
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; her family, Lord. I'm sure they're on
[1:36:45] her heart.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; I I pray that you would answer every
[1:36:49] prayer request.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; And sister Claudia, Lord Jesus,
[1:36:55] you've heard her request.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; There's so many needs, Lord. We thank
[1:37:00] you that you make provisions for them.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Father,
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; as they labor and look for work, you
[1:37:06] bless them with work now.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; But I pray, Lord, they need help in the
[1:37:12] spirit. They need to be born again.
[1:37:15] They need the Holy Spirit in their life.
[1:37:17] We pray for them. Save their soul. Lord,
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; may none of them be missing on that day.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; They've been here faithfully coming to
[1:37:25] the service. Lord, you know, in the
[1:37:28] past, but Lord Jesus, they have gone
[1:37:30] astray.
[1:37:32] We go after them with that little thing
[1:37:34] that we
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; may enemies
[1:37:51] at different times,
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; different things, Lord that came up and
[1:37:55] you helped so wonderfully. Yes.
[1:37:58] We thank you for sister shar
[1:38:01] Lord Jesus we believe that your hand was
[1:38:03] on on that washer I believe it was
[1:38:09] Lord we've had different experiences
[1:38:11] like that sister Kathy as well
[1:38:16] and brother Andrew with this anxiety I
[1:38:18] know what anxiety is all about Lord
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; but you are the one that gives peace
[1:38:23] Lord
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; you're a peace giver Yes.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; And I pray that you would give Brother
[1:38:28] Andrew peace.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; Oh God, all things will work out.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Oh God, we're so grateful for everyone
[1:38:37] that's here tonight.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; We need a blessing, Lord. We need a
[1:38:41] touch from Yes.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Lord, all is well, but we need that Holy
[1:38:46] Spirit to come.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; That we could just touch, Lord. Like we
[1:38:51] like that boy was able to feel that tug
[1:38:54] on that balloon.
[1:38:56] We need that little tug ever so often
[1:38:58] that we know that you're there.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you, Lord Jesus, for
[1:39:02] brother Godfrey that is with us.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; how we thank you for his life.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, you're leading him and
[1:39:11] guiding him.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; You're prospering him, Lord.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; We pray for more blessings upon his
[1:39:18] life.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; And his whole family.
[1:39:21] May we seek the kingdom of God first.
[1:39:25] and all other things will be added unto
[1:39:27] us.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we just want things, but Lord,
[1:39:31] we ask what we have need of.
[1:39:34] We all have some needs, physical needs,
[1:39:37] spiritual needs,
[1:39:39] material needs. Lord, whatever they are,
[1:39:41] you are a provider.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; You're our God, our savior.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; You've been so good to us. We don't want
[1:39:49] to ever forget your goodness.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Thank you for the
[1:39:52] blood again of God. When you when we
[1:39:56] think about the creator of heavens and
[1:39:58] earth came down to be spat upon
[1:40:02] his spirit torn from him.
[1:40:05] That was our creator, our Lord, our God
[1:40:10] that came down to carry our burdens, our
[1:40:13] sins far away, so that each one of us
[1:40:16] may have life eternal. We thank you
[1:40:19] tonight.
[1:40:21] We thank you for the word of God that we
[1:40:23] heard today.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; We need just need to apply it, Lord.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; We have lots of word to hear, but we
[1:40:30] need to apply it.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Oh God, help us to
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; walk the walk like like we heard today
[1:40:37] that Jacob was no longer the Jacob. He
[1:40:42] was a limping prince.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; He was Israel from there on. And so Lord
[1:40:48] God, we're the bride from here on.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; We're no longer called the church called
[1:40:54] out,
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; but we're the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:40:57] that's called in.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; To be with you, to have that fellowship
[1:41:02] with you.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; We thank you tonight.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't know whether I forgot some
[1:41:07] of the prayer requests, but Lord, you
[1:41:10] know every heart.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; You know every desire. I pray that you
[1:41:15] would put a greater desire in our heart
[1:41:18] and may the Holy Ghost just sweep over
[1:41:20] this place
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; because nothing else satisfies us.
[1:41:26] We can Lord hear about lots of preaching
[1:41:29] and good preaching like we heard on
[1:41:31] Sunday
[1:41:34] like we hear on many many Wednesdays.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; But Lord Jesus, we want your Holy Spirit
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; to quicken our lives, our very we need
[1:41:46] an outpouring of the Holy Ghost upon
[1:41:48] this little church.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; This letter is not enough.
[1:41:54] We've had some good speakers but Lord we
[1:41:57] are not happy just with speaking.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; You said Lord this gospel would be
[1:42:02] demonstrated.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; It would be manifested through your
[1:42:06] peers in your people.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; And you would answer prayer. Lord, you
[1:42:11] know the different needs and prayer
[1:42:13] requests.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; there's still different people that are
[1:42:16] sick, Lord, of this diabetes.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Oh God, we've been asking you, but Lord,
[1:42:22] there is there is Lord Jesus bomb in
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; there's Lord in the Lord.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; There's life in your word and you made
[1:42:33] these promises.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; and we claim them here tonight in the
[1:42:37] name of Jesus.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every devil has to flee, Lord.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Lord, sickness is of the devil. And you
[1:42:45] said, Lord, through the prophet that we
[1:42:47] need to rebuke that life of of that
[1:42:50] sickness.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; So, we rebuke that life of that every
[1:42:53] sickness that so besets us in the name
[1:42:56] of Jesus Christ.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Satan, you are defeated.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; And we claim the promise and the victory
[1:43:03] in Jesus.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; We thank you tonight for your mercy. We
[1:43:07] thank you Lord for for brother France
[1:43:11] that he made a decision for you to to be
[1:43:14] baptized Lord in water
[1:43:17] but Lord we ask not only to be baptized
[1:43:20] with water. There's one greater here
[1:43:23] that can baptize with the Holy Ghost.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; It's not automatically that we get the
[1:43:29] Holy Ghost. We need to be baptized
[1:43:33] and then we have the promise of the Holy
[1:43:35] Ghost. May you give our brother, little
[1:43:39] brother, Lord, who's growing up so
[1:43:41] quickly.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Fill them with the Holy Spirit. I pray
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; bless the whole family, the children.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; We thank you in Jesus name.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; We want to tell you, Lord, that we love
[1:43:52] you.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; We love you with all our heart.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Help us to obey. Help us. Give us
[1:43:58] strength in this hour.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; This hour of distractions.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Everywhere we look, there's
[1:44:04] distractions.
[1:44:06] Whether it's the cold weather or whether
[1:44:08] it's the the radio or the YouTube or
[1:44:12] what whatever it may be,
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; but Lord, you're greater than all these.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; put that desire in the heart, in my
[1:44:20] heart.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; I'm not just talking about the people in
[1:44:25] front of me.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; I pray that you would put my greater
[1:44:29] desire in my heart
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; because Lord, I want to make it.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. I want to make it in the
[1:44:35] rapture.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Lord God, I want to do everything
[1:44:39] possible. Run this race with fervor.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Oh God, not make it by the skin of my
[1:44:45] teeth.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; But make it, Lord Jesus, by the grace of
[1:44:49] God.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; We thank you tonight. We want to worship
[1:44:52] you.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; We want to adore you.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; We want to magnify thy wonderful name,
[1:44:57] the name of Jesus that we love and love
[1:45:00] to hear and speak about. We thank you in
[1:45:04] Jesus name. Amen. Can you say amen?
