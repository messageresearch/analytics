[15:47] the same way.
[15:48] &gt;&gt; And I've been preaching a series and I'm
[15:50] not going to preach on that, but this is
[15:53] a little Wednesday night thought after I
[15:55] preached three uh services on emotions.
[16:00] getting your mind, your thoughts,
[16:05] and your emotions under the control of
[16:08] God.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; See, we as believers shouldn't be high
[16:13] on the mountain
[16:15] &gt;&gt; and down in the valley the next day and
[16:17] up and down, up and down. That just
[16:20] shows that you that you don't know the
[16:22] Lord. That's just shows that when you're
[16:24] down in the valley, you don't trust the
[16:26] Lord.
[16:28] And when you're high on the mountain,
[16:30] you think it's you,
[16:32] you know, and it's not. It's not me on
[16:34] the mountain. It's not me in the valley.
[16:35] It's God
[16:37] &gt;&gt; teaching me. It's God shaping me
[16:41] &gt;&gt; to help his
[16:43] bride. And every one of us is a worker.
[16:46] Like just because a pastor, he's not
[16:49] he's not the kingpin. He's just the one
[16:52] pointing you to
[16:55] &gt;&gt; the word. He's pointing you to the the
[16:59] word of God and where to find your
[17:01] answers, where to find the strength that
[17:04] you need to carry on.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; So tonight, I want to talk about a
[17:09] little thought that the Lord placed on
[17:11] my heart and it's right attitude. The
[17:14] right attitude,
[17:16] you know, and I'm taking it from uh
[17:19] Joshua 14 6-14.
[17:23] And you know, when you think about it,
[17:25] two million people left Egypt.
[17:29] Thank you very much for playing Peter,
[17:31] brother Peter, brother Gan. I just met
[17:34] them tonight and I'm I was talking to
[17:36] them and I feel like I've known them for
[17:38] a long time already.
[17:41] &gt;&gt; But you know, they two million people
[17:44] left Egypt.
[17:46] They all walked.
[17:49] They all seen the pillar of fire. They
[17:51] ate the mana. Every day they had the
[17:54] cloud over them. God God give them a
[17:56] little shade during the day and the
[17:59] pillar of fire at night as protection,
[18:01] as a sign that he was there for them and
[18:05] with them.
[18:07] And here they were. And you'd think that
[18:10] with that kind of presence,
[18:13] with that kind of presence of the Lord
[18:17] there during the night, during the day,
[18:20] and the mana they received, that you
[18:22] would think there would be no doubt
[18:25] about it that they would cross that
[18:27] Jordan and take the promised land. There
[18:28] would be no fear about anything.
[18:32] &gt;&gt; And yet only two of them had the faith.
[18:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's true. And you know, I'm I'm
[18:38] I'm looking at us as message people
[18:42] and I don't know, I think 69 is probably
[18:46] the year that a lot of that Canada kind
[18:48] of turned to the message.
[18:51] That was the year I mean my dad was uh
[18:54] in brother Bram's meetings here in
[18:56] Edmonton and Grand Prairie, Dozen Creek
[18:58] and in Regina and and uh and he he was
[19:02] following the prophet. But I know we
[19:04] were listening to tapes in our little
[19:05] place in Valiview, Alberta here. And so
[19:08] I'm an Alberta boy. So,
[19:11] but you know 69 is when when a kind of a
[19:15] move through Canada came
[19:18] and they had the first camp meeting at
[19:20] Moose Lake.
[19:24] And we should be so much further ahead
[19:27] &gt;&gt; in my opinion. You know, we should be
[19:31] going over That's right.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; But you know, God is is is uh
[19:37] he wants us to have the right attitude.
[19:39] There's a few that have that have come
[19:41] back and and shown us what
[19:44] you know and I would say there the 12
[19:46] spies or there was 12 preachers that
[19:48] went over to the and and got the thing
[19:51] and there was two of them that came back
[19:52] that had the fruit that that had and
[19:55] said, "Yes, we can. We are more than
[19:57] able."
[19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:00] &gt;&gt; We are more than able.
[20:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:03] So, where are we tonight?
[20:05] &gt;&gt; Let's stand. Let's open the word.
[20:10] &gt;&gt; Let's pray before we open this word and
[20:12] just ask him to come.
[20:14] Lord, I just thank you tonight.
[20:18] Lord, brother Moses, brother Zeg here,
[20:21] encourage me, Lord, to take this
[20:23] service. And Lord, I just want to say,
[20:25] Lord, you are the one. It's your word
[20:28] that we're dividing. Lord, it's not
[20:31] mine.
[20:33] Lord, I'm nothing. I'm just a little and
[20:35] like to remind myself every day I'm a
[20:38] little bit of dust. That you had Lord
[20:41] Jesus the mercy, the grace. We sang
[20:44] about amazing grace. the grace that came
[20:47] and Lord you entered into this little
[20:49] bit of dust and you Lord delivered this
[20:52] piece of dust from all the sins and
[20:55] things of the world and and brought me
[20:57] into thy presence Lord and showed me
[21:00] Lord Jesus
[21:02] thy truth
[21:04] and Lord you gave me Lord the confidence
[21:08] to take thy word and hold to thy word no
[21:11] matter what the circumstances and Lord I
[21:14] say tonight come into our little
[21:16] fellowship here tonight, Lord. Impart
[21:19] the word to everyone, Lord. Every one of
[21:21] us, Lord. Maybe somebody here tonight
[21:23] needs a little chicken or a little beef,
[21:26] Lord, or needs a little gravy or or
[21:28] Lord, whatever it is they need, Lord.
[21:30] Give it to them,
[21:32] &gt;&gt; Lord, through thy word, through the gift
[21:34] that you have placed in thy body, Lord,
[21:37] that they might be strengthened,
[21:39] encouraged, Lord Jesus, corrected,
[21:41] whatever it is they need, Lord, to come
[21:44] into your presence and to have the right
[21:46] attitude to take the body change. Lord,
[21:50] we know we're coming to that place. We
[21:52] know, Lord, that it could happen at any
[21:54] time, Lord. And I will say, Lord, I need
[21:57] it already. I would like to have a body
[21:59] change, Lord. I feel, Lord, I'm getting
[22:01] older every day, Lord. A little weaker,
[22:04] a little more feeble, but Lord, I know
[22:06] that you are still with me.
[22:08] &gt;&gt; And Lord, I want to be a Joshua. I want
[22:10] to be a Caleb, Lord. Oh Lord, that their
[22:13] strength was not abaded, Lord. It was
[22:15] there still. And Lord, they took that
[22:18] land and they took that mountain. And
[22:20] Lord, I thank you for your loving
[22:22] kindness. Touch us tonight by thy
[22:24] spirit. hear our cry in Jesus name we
[22:28] pray. Amen.
[22:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. In Joshua 14:6, it says, "Then the
[22:34] children of Judah
[22:37] came unto Joshua in Gilgal, and Caleb
[22:40] the son of Jeffunath the Kenzite, and
[22:43] said unto him, Thou knowest the thing
[22:46] that the Lord said unto Moses, the man
[22:48] of God, concerning me, and thee in
[22:51] Kadesh Barnea." 40 years old was I when
[22:55] Moses, the servant of the Lord, sent me
[22:58] from Kadesh Barnea to Espy out the land,
[23:01] and I brought him word again as it was
[23:04] in mine heart. Nevertheless, my brethren
[23:08] that went up with me made the heart of
[23:12] the people melt. Look at
[23:17] &gt;&gt; some can make your heart melt actually
[23:20] take faith from you
[23:22] &gt;&gt; and some can give you faith. Oh my. And
[23:25] he said, "But I wholly followed the Lord
[23:27] my God."
[23:29] &gt;&gt; And Moses swore on that day, saying,
[23:31] "Surely the land whereon thy feet have
[23:33] trotten shall be thine inheritance,
[23:36] and thy childrens forever, because thou
[23:39] hast wholly followed the Lord thy God."
[23:41] Holy. Holy is what he needs us to follow
[23:45] him
[23:46] &gt;&gt; not partially
[23:48] &gt;&gt; but with a whole heart.
[23:51] And now behold the Lord hath kept me
[23:53] alive as he said these 40 and five
[23:55] years. Ever since the Lord spake this
[23:58] word unto Moses while the children of
[23:59] Israel wandered in the wilderness. Now
[24:01] lo, I am this day four score and five
[24:04] years old. And as yet I am as strong
[24:08] this day as I was in the day that Moses
[24:11] sent me. As my strength was then, even
[24:14] so is my strength now for war, both to
[24:17] go out and to come in. Now therefore,
[24:21] give me this mountain whereof the Lord
[24:24] spake in that day. For thou heardest in
[24:26] that day, how the Anakims were there,
[24:28] and the cities were great and fenced. If
[24:31] so be, the Lord will be with me, then I
[24:34] shall be able to drive them out as the
[24:37] Lord said. If the Lord is with you,
[24:41] &gt;&gt; there's nothing can stand before you if
[24:44] the Lord is with you. Amen.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; And Joshua blessed him and gave unto
[24:50] Caleb the son of Jeffunith Hebron for an
[24:54] inheritance. He therefore became the
[24:57] inheritance of Caleb the son of Jeffuna
[25:00] the Kenzite unto this day because that
[25:02] he wholly followed the Lord God of
[25:06] Israel.
[25:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And may God in his blessing to his
[25:09] word. You may be seated.
[25:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:14] &gt;&gt; So we know that what attitude is.
[25:18] Attitude is a feeling or a way of
[25:20] thinking that affects a person's
[25:24] behavior.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; And you know when we read this here, we
[25:30] see that Joshua and Caleb had the right
[25:33] attitude.
[25:35] and God because of their right attitude,
[25:39] their strength didn't go down. Even
[25:42] though they were from 40 to 85, they
[25:45] were still as strong as they were when
[25:47] they were 45.
[25:49] &gt;&gt; So, Caleb had the right way of thinking.
[25:52] &gt;&gt; He believed that what Moses said was
[25:54] true because he believed it was the word
[25:57] of God.
[25:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; You see, and we've been given a word of
[26:00] God for this day. And if we believe it's
[26:02] true,
[26:04] then you know what? Then we have the
[26:07] same power behind that word that he had.
[26:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:10] &gt;&gt; The same power is there because the word
[26:13] is as strong as it was in 63 as it is in
[26:18] 2025.
[26:20] It's the same word, the same power, the
[26:22] same Lord, the same Jesus, and the same,
[26:28] should I say, we have we have a um a
[26:33] predestination.
[26:35] We h we are the seed of God that was in
[26:38] the presence of the Lord before the
[26:40] foundation of the world. So it is the
[26:43] same word in us that can take this body
[26:48] change.
[26:49] &gt;&gt; That is why Joshua and Caleb kept their
[26:51] strength and possessed the promised
[26:53] land. Caleb possessed Hebron because he
[26:56] wholly followed the Lord God of Israel.
[26:59] They believed what the angel of the Lord
[27:01] told Moses.
[27:04] And I got this thought
[27:07] from watching a YouTube
[27:11] about a man in Israel that has he's an
[27:16] Israelite who's went into the West Bank
[27:20] area and he's claimed Hebrron.
[27:24] He has claimed he's a single man. He has
[27:27] claimed Hebrron and he is throwing the
[27:30] Palestinians
[27:31] out of their homes and out of their land
[27:34] and he's taking possession of it because
[27:36] he said this is our land.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:41] &gt;&gt; You know what? And and you know uh uh
[27:46] you can listen to the narrative from
[27:51] the Palestinian side and you can listen
[27:54] to the narrative from the Jew side
[27:57] and if we take the Lord's side whose
[28:00] side are we on?
[28:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; Whose side are we on? So, you know what?
[28:06] I tell you, you know, I tell you, war is
[28:08] war, and war is not I I mean, I know I
[28:11] came from uh parents that went through
[28:13] the Second World War, so I know what war
[28:15] is
[28:18] &gt;&gt; and I know it's it's not good to
[28:20] anybody. It's not good for the victor.
[28:22] It's it's it's it's look at the PS the P
[28:26] PTSD and all that that's in in the
[28:29] victors and even in the losers. It it's
[28:31] just war is is is not what God made us
[28:35] for.
[28:38] &gt;&gt; But he equips his and and you know we as
[28:42] believers we don't fight with with flesh
[28:44] and blood.
[28:47] &gt;&gt; And I think sometimes we have the
[28:50] thought that we have to do it flesh and
[28:52] blood.
[28:54] So we get into politics to try to change
[29:00] the church,
[29:03] &gt;&gt; you know, instead of getting on our
[29:04] knees and getting the presence of the
[29:06] Lord behind us
[29:08] &gt;&gt; and holding to God's word and saying,
[29:10] "God, change that pastor."
[29:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[29:14] &gt;&gt; I tell my my my church all the time,
[29:16] pray for this pastor. This piece of
[29:18] flesh here needs the presence of the
[29:21] Lord to mold his heart, right? to bring
[29:23] the right thoughts from him, to bring
[29:25] the right attitude to him
[29:27] &gt;&gt; because you know what where you have
[29:29] your thoughts dwelling is how you're
[29:32] going to react.
[29:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[29:34] &gt;&gt; So I always uh you know my wife has said
[29:36] to me some how can you how can you talk
[29:39] to those people like that after what
[29:41] they said to about you or to you? And I
[29:44] say, "Honey,
[29:46] when somebody has been
[29:49] critical
[29:51] &gt;&gt; and negative, it's because he's been
[29:53] feeding on that negative critical
[29:57] accuser of the brethren. He's been
[29:59] feeding from that trough."
[30:02] &gt;&gt; True. But when you feed from the sweet
[30:06] precious anointing that flowed through
[30:08] Aaron's
[30:10] from his head to his toe and in the
[30:13] holies of holies, I'll tell you what,
[30:14] it's a completely different attitude.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; You know, it's victory. It's it's
[30:19] victory even when it looks like defeat.
[30:22] It's victory to you.
[30:24] &gt;&gt; And so I just want to say, you know,
[30:26] let's let's get the right attitude.
[30:30] Brother Brandham says, "And speak to the
[30:32] rock and it shall give forth his water."
[30:34] He says in 1960, he says, "Joshua fought
[30:37] every inch of ground from one end of the
[30:39] country to the other one." But he had a
[30:42] promise. God said, "I'll give it to
[30:45] you."
[30:46] &gt;&gt; And what did God say in to us in this
[30:48] day? I will give it to you if you will
[30:51] only believe.
[30:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; Only believe. All things are possible.
[30:56] That is something we heard every
[30:57] service.
[31:00] Every tape you put on,
[31:02] &gt;&gt; you hear it.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whether there's giants, whether
[31:06] there's atheists, whether there's
[31:07] infidels, whether there's cold formal
[31:09] churches, what difference does it make?
[31:13] God gave the promise. Let's take it.
[31:15] It's ours. It belongs to us. It's our
[31:17] possession. Let's go get it.
[31:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what I want to do. I want
[31:21] to get it. I want to take my body, new
[31:25] body. I want to get it. I don't want to
[31:27] look left or right. I don't want to know
[31:30] what they're doing in Siri. I don't know
[31:32] what they're doing in Edmonton. But I
[31:34] want to know in Colona that God is
[31:36] there.
[31:37] &gt;&gt; And I know that he's here, too. If
[31:39] you're looking to him, he's here, too.
[31:41] And he wants to lead you. He wants to
[31:44] guide you. He wants to be inside you. He
[31:46] wants to give you the victory.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; But you got to what? Keep your heart and
[31:52] mind stayed on him.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:56] Look at what it says in Exodus 23 to uh
[32:00] 23-2 and and and 23. It says, "For mine
[32:04] angels shall go before thee
[32:07] and bring thee in unto the Amorites and
[32:09] the Hittites and the paris parizzites
[32:13] par
[32:15] and the Canaanites and the Hivites and
[32:17] the Jebusites, and I will cut them off.
[32:20] Thou shalt not bow down to their gods,
[32:22] nor serve them, nor do after their
[32:25] works, but thou shalt utterly overthrow
[32:27] them, and quite break down their images,
[32:32] and ye shall serve the Lord your God,
[32:34] and he shall bless thy bread and thy
[32:35] water, and I will take sickness away
[32:37] from the midst of thee.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; Now, I just want to show you what that
[32:43] means to us.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; It means don't follow the dominational
[32:47] system.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:49] That means don't even go after their
[32:53] seminars, their thinking, but stay in
[32:58] the word. Stay in his channel. Don't
[33:02] look and see, oh, it worked over there.
[33:05] Oh, this is working. You know what? Stay
[33:07] in your channel because God has a
[33:10] different gift.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; For every one of us. He's He's got a
[33:13] Moses here. He had a Zigg here before.
[33:15] Now he's got a Moses here. And Moses has
[33:18] got a little different channel. He's got
[33:20] to go his way that God has shown him.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; You know, and you've got to get behind
[33:26] him or go change your church. It's up to
[33:28] you.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; But you've got to get behind him and
[33:31] say, "Lord, I believe if brother Moses
[33:33] is put here for you put him here, then
[33:35] help me support him. Help me back him
[33:38] and everything in me go
[33:41] &gt;&gt; and do the thing." And I'll tell you
[33:42] what God will work. Because you know
[33:44] what really going to church is all
[33:46] about? Submission.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; True.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; It's submission. And God didn't say make
[33:54] Mo Brother Moses your head.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; No, he said make the word your head.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; This is our head.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; This is what we've been restored back
[34:03] to,
[34:04] &gt;&gt; the word of God. So if the word is our
[34:06] head, all what brother Moses is doing is
[34:10] bringing you to the word to show you
[34:12] &gt;&gt; this is what God has laid out. This is
[34:14] what he wants you to follow. This is how
[34:16] he wants you to do it. And let's just
[34:18] walk.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; You know what? Like brother Brown talks
[34:21] about the sheep when he was in the east.
[34:23] He said, you know, it was a it was a a a
[34:26] a great big uh garden bizaar or
[34:29] whatever, you know, a market, he said,
[34:32] and the sheep just followed the shepherd
[34:33] right through. They didn't nibble. They
[34:35] didn't go here. They didn't go there.
[34:37] They just went right through. They
[34:38] listened to the shepherd.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; And you know what is it? It is It is
[34:43] submitting to God to the one that he's
[34:47] put you under.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; You know, I've had people say, "Oh, I'd
[34:51] like to move to Colona." And you know, I
[34:53] would love to say move. But I always
[34:56] tell them, listen, you better make sure
[34:57] it's God's will.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; Because if you get there and it's not
[35:02] God's will, it's never going to work for
[35:03] you. That's right.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; First of all, you're going to be mad at
[35:06] the preacher all the time because he's
[35:08] going to be he's going to be correcting
[35:09] you.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; You know, he's like, and I've said like
[35:18] I've had some of my congregation tell me
[35:20] the last couple years, you're very rude,
[35:22] brother John.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; I says, it's only rude if you can't take
[35:26] correction.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; Then it's rude. But if you receive the
[35:30] correction that God gives, you take it
[35:32] and you say, "Lord, help me." And just
[35:34] walk on with the Lord. But it's rude if
[35:37] you don't want correction.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; It's rude if you can't take it. But you
[35:41] know what God said to me when when I,
[35:44] you know, after I was eight years a
[35:46] pastor, my dad couldn't do it anymore.
[35:48] And he was three years with a stroke and
[35:49] he couldn't read, he couldn't couldn't
[35:52] speak. And so
[35:55] and then God told me preach not like a
[35:58] salesman
[36:00] because I was a salesman all my life. I
[36:02] I'm a salesman and I was a good
[36:04] salesman.
[36:06] I love to sell. I love people and I love
[36:10] I still love people but I love to give
[36:12] them the gospel now. And it's you know
[36:14] what it's the the the hardest
[36:18] cell I've ever had is the gospel.
[36:21] But it's the only thing that I've ever
[36:23] sold that's free.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; It's absolutely free. And it's and it's
[36:30] lasts longer than a car and a suit.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; I can tell you last way longer
[36:37] &gt;&gt; and it's eternal. And it'll change your
[36:39] life. It'll give you victory. It'll heal
[36:41] your body when you're sick.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; It'll deliver you.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know it's the hardest cell
[36:48] because you have to submit to God. You
[36:52] have to say, "Lord, I need you now."
[36:54] That's one of my favorite songs right
[36:55] now. Do you guys sing it here?
[36:57] &gt;&gt; I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord,
[36:59] right now.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; How many can say that?
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham goes on to say, Joshua
[37:07] and Caleb
[37:09] knowed what God had said, so they
[37:11] believed it. See, they knew what God had
[37:13] said, and they believed it. Now notice
[37:16] in the 29th verse, he said, "I will
[37:19] drive them all out in one year, unless
[37:21] the beasts of the field multiply against
[37:24] you and come against you, but little by
[37:25] little will I drive them out. Just as
[37:28] you're able to possess the land, I'll
[37:31] drive them out." There you are. The
[37:32] angel of the covenant, 1954.
[37:37] So what is it? It's the right attitude.
[37:39] The two and a half million could have
[37:41] had the same attitude that Joshua and
[37:43] Caleb had. They all saw the same things,
[37:45] ate the same mana, watched God drive the
[37:47] inhabitants from the land. They were all
[37:50] baptized in the Red Sea.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; What it says in Hebrews,
[37:57] &gt;&gt; they had a or or Corinthians, I should
[37:59] say, they had the same witness, the same
[38:03] miracles, the same signs, but they just
[38:06] didn't get it.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; Right?
[38:08] &gt;&gt; What is it?
[38:10] You know, I to me I just can't believe
[38:12] that people could have been listening to
[38:15] the message for 40 years
[38:18] and then forsake the message and say the
[38:21] prophet's wrong when the miracles and
[38:24] signs and wonders and everything that
[38:27] has been done and and were there and all
[38:30] that and all of a sudden just to say no
[38:32] is wrong and he's not the prophet of
[38:33] this day. You know what it just shows
[38:35] you that just like the children of
[38:37] Israel they followed Moses. They
[38:40] followed him for 40 years. They followed
[38:42] the prophet for 40 years and they
[38:45] couldn't
[38:47] take it.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; Why is it
[38:51] the Bible says and Paul says because of
[38:54] unbelief
[38:56] &gt;&gt; and not one of them will make it.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; They are in utter darkness
[39:02] because of the witness they had.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'll tell you what, today I
[39:07] we've gone too far to turn back.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; We've gone way too far to turn back. So,
[39:13] how do we get the right attitude?
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Don't get distracted.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Don't get your eyes off of Jesus. You
[39:21] know, Colossians chapter 3, verses 1-4,
[39:24] my favorite passage of scripture.
[39:29] Keep your attention on Jesus
[39:32] &gt;&gt; because when he appears, you'll appear
[39:34] with him.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; You see, so it's who you look to
[39:38] &gt;&gt; and don't get angry. Don't get mad at
[39:41] your brother. Don't get disappointed in
[39:44] your brother.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; Why? Because we're in the flesh.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; You know what? And and and sometimes,
[39:50] look at I I I I've been I've been
[39:52] preaching about Joseph.
[39:56] Look at how he had to be persecuted by
[39:59] his own brothers in order to get him to
[40:01] Egypt.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; And God sometimes persecutes us by
[40:06] message people
[40:08] &gt;&gt; to get us to the right place so he can
[40:10] save the people that were persecuting
[40:14] you.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; So, you know what? We've got to be
[40:18] careful. Yeah.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; You know, I I always say this and and
[40:22] and and brother um uh Peter there was
[40:25] tell talking to me about a brother that
[40:27] we used to come to my church and and I
[40:30] remember talking about him with my dad
[40:32] and and he was a a brother that uh that
[40:35] he was, you know, he was um up and down
[40:38] up and down. And so my dad said
[40:41] something once and he said, you know, he
[40:43] said, "I don't know about that, brother.
[40:45] I think there's something wrong with him
[40:46] or whatever."
[40:48] And you know, uh, he said he went to
[40:50] prayer and God said, "Why are you
[40:52] talking like that about?"
[40:56] One of my,
[40:58] &gt;&gt; you know what that just shows you?
[41:01] Somebody might not be living right.
[41:04] Somebody might not have the victory yet,
[41:07] but he's God's.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; You know, so I I I I'll tell you what,
[41:12] it's really checked me
[41:14] to make sure that I don't
[41:18] say something about one of God's
[41:20] children because I don't I I can't see
[41:23] into anybody's heart.
[41:26] And how many times have we loved
[41:28] somebody
[41:30] and really loved them and then found out
[41:32] what a disappointment they were because
[41:34] they've they've they've turned out that
[41:36] they fell away and and completely
[41:38] rejected the message and gone.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; And you realize that you know what? You
[41:42] you thought this guy was in you thought
[41:44] this guy was something special, right?
[41:47] But you know what? God only sees the
[41:48] heart. God knows what's right inside.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; But faith is a gift from God. See, faith
[41:57] is a gift from God. The seed of God in
[42:00] you is Godplaced. It's not you didn't
[42:03] place it. God swed it and it fell in
[42:07] good ground.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; And that is why you know we we it's a
[42:12] gift.
[42:14] And when you see God do something, if
[42:16] you don't praise him for it and worship
[42:18] him for it, you can't build or grow your
[42:20] faith.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; And that's what I find so u why people
[42:24] are so up and down.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; If you look at that message that
[42:27] brothers, why are people, you know, why
[42:30] are they tossed about? Why? because
[42:33] because they don't thank God for the
[42:36] things that he's given and the things
[42:37] that he's done for them and and they
[42:40] they just can't seem to
[42:44] worship him enough. And I say, you know
[42:46] what? If you really want to get into the
[42:47] presence of God, don't cry out for your
[42:50] need. Worship him.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Worship him. That's what brings the
[42:55] power of God down. I can remember
[42:59] 1972
[43:01] [Music]
[43:04] in South Edmonton here. Ziggclaw, Anita
[43:07] Clar, my parents, we were kneeling in
[43:10] their living room praying
[43:14] and the presence of the Lord came down,
[43:17] you know, tongues and interpretation and
[43:20] it was just the the moving of the
[43:22] spirit.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; Well, it wasn't it wasn't crying out for
[43:26] need. was just worshiping God.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; And I find that, you know, there's a
[43:31] song that says whatever, worship.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; Whatever worship.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what, if we would just
[43:38] come, you know what worship means?
[43:42] Look up the meaning.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; It means excessive,
[43:47] not ordinary
[43:49] praise.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Excessive. So I'm just wondering did you
[43:53] come here tonight and were you excessive
[43:56] in your worship?
[43:58] &gt;&gt; That's what worship means. It means it
[44:00] means not ordinary, not regular, but
[44:04] excessive.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; And I think that's that's what God wants
[44:09] from us.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; That's what God wants from us. The more
[44:12] you reason things out, the less likely
[44:14] you're going to attribute that to God.
[44:17] For the devil will steal the word and
[44:19] his humility from you.
[44:22] That's what the devil does. He's He's so
[44:25] good at coming in when when you've had
[44:28] God's done something, coming in and
[44:30] stealing the victory and making you
[44:32] think negatively.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; That's his job. And I'll tell you, he's
[44:37] good at it.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; And if you allow your flesh, see, that's
[44:40] to come. We have to become superhuman.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; That's to come. We've got to not dwell
[44:45] in our feelings, but dwell on the word.
[44:47] And when you dwell on the word, you see
[44:49] the victory. You see the healing. You
[44:50] see the deliverance. You see what God
[44:52] has promised and you go for it. Like
[44:54] Joshua and Caleb, they didn't look at
[44:56] the giants. They didn't look at the
[44:57] walls. They didn't look at at at their
[44:59] their un inability to fight a war like
[45:02] the rest of them. They looked at God's
[45:04] promise. They believed God. They seen
[45:06] that God carried them. And away they
[45:08] went and took the land.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; Look at it says proving his word 1964
[45:17] uh paragraph 112. And the general went
[45:20] out and picked him out a man out of each
[45:21] tribe and they took off. He took Caleb,
[45:24] his side buddy, because he knowed Caleb
[45:26] believed.
[45:28] See, that's what God does. He picks a
[45:30] believers. And they went over into the
[45:33] promised land and came back with a bunch
[45:34] of grapes that even two men took that
[45:37] taken two men to pack. Say, he said,
[45:39] "Now, so that Israel will have the
[45:41] evidence before they even get into the
[45:43] promised sea. They'll have the evidence
[45:44] that God said it's a good land." See,
[45:47] God gives us the evidence
[45:51] &gt;&gt; that we're going to have a body change.
[45:52] You know, you know what the evidence is?
[45:54] I'll tell you what, 34 years,
[45:57] 7 months, he gave me the evidence.
[46:01] From death unto life,
[46:03] &gt;&gt; from a death sentence
[46:06] and he healed me. I was dying and he
[46:10] changed it and brought me back to life.
[46:13] That was evidence that he can do the
[46:15] body change. That was the evidence to me
[46:17] that he is there. He's able.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; And he's doing it.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; And all that I said and and you know, if
[46:25] you ever want to the God who answers
[46:27] prayer, if you ever want to go on on on
[46:29] on.org,
[46:31] the God who answers prayer, my testimony
[46:34] is on there.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; And I went to the with brother Steve and
[46:38] and brother John Andy's. And I was in at
[46:41] the fair in Lyndon. And I'll tell you
[46:43] what, what a what a a a moving of the
[46:47] Lord.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; I love, you know, I I I'm off track
[46:51] here, but I I just have to bring this
[46:53] in. I love the attitude. It wasn't here,
[46:55] you got to accept the prophet for the
[46:57] day. It was we believe in a God who
[46:58] still answers prayer.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; You know, you want a living God. Well,
[47:02] then come. We'll we'll introduce you to
[47:04] him. We'll show you what his what faith
[47:07] in God is according to the fathers of
[47:09] our faith. You see, that's what how we
[47:11] got to bring the gospel to the people.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Say, we're going to bring it to the
[47:15] faith of our fathers because it's been
[47:18] restored to us because God has answered
[47:20] our prayer. God has met us in the hour
[47:23] of our need.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; And look what he says here. And it's a
[47:26] good land. See, they'll have the
[47:27] evidence. It's a good It's filled with
[47:28] milk and honey. It's a grand land. It's
[47:31] a good land. Now, all this old garlic
[47:34] gleak and whatever you got here in
[47:35] Egypt, now we're taking you to a land
[47:37] with milk and honey. You'll probably
[47:39] never tasted either one, milk or honey
[47:42] down there in Egypt all these years.
[47:44] They just give you the slaves rationing.
[47:48] But now you're going to this land. So
[47:49] just at the time they got in about one
[47:52] day's journey where Kadesh Banira, the
[47:56] great judgment seat of the world was
[47:58] they stopped under these great palms out
[48:00] there, the springs encamped. He said now
[48:02] to let the people know, watch what a
[48:04] perfect, what a real perfect evidence it
[48:07] is how God does that just as he does
[48:09] today. God said the land is great. Now
[48:12] before you go over, I want you to see
[48:14] the land is great. So go bring me back
[48:16] some evidence of the land and show it to
[48:18] the people. And you know I believe God
[48:20] is giving us evidence every service,
[48:23] every Wednesday service, every Sunday
[48:25] service that God is going to bring a
[48:28] body change.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; He is going to bring it. He's going to
[48:31] bring cuz the the word is the same. You
[48:34] got to believe it and you can receive
[48:36] it.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; See, you can be in a group of 300 people
[48:39] or a group of 15 or 20 as as many as we
[48:42] got here. And you know, if you are a
[48:44] believer, you receive something tonight.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; If you are a believer, you'll take his
[48:48] word and you'll say, "God, you've
[48:50] revealed it. I believe it." And thank
[48:52] you for your encouragement.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; That's all. That's all it takes.
[48:57] Look at there was two in amongst two
[48:59] million.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; You they could have been disappointed.
[49:06] They could have given up and said,
[49:07] "Well, I guess we can't do it then if
[49:08] there only two of us." No, no, no, no,
[49:10] no. They said, "If we got to go
[49:12] ourselves,
[49:13] &gt;&gt; if we got to go ourselves."
[49:16] &gt;&gt; And look at look at what God did in
[49:18] Jericho.
[49:20] Look at Rahab. She says, "We're quaking
[49:23] behind these big walls, behind our
[49:26] chariots, behind our trained soldiers.
[49:30] We're shaking." Why? Because God wiped
[49:33] out Egypt on the way there.
[49:37] God God took care of all those kings on
[49:40] the way there. Well, well, see,
[49:44] we don't know. The devil wants us to
[49:46] think negatively.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; He wants us to think scared. And the
[49:51] devil, his people are scared.
[49:54] These people have power and the devil
[49:57] wants you to think scared. So, you know,
[49:59] we've got the victory.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Let's with let's get the right attitude
[50:04] and take the victory.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; Look, our prophet in this day heard from
[50:09] the Lord and he had and he had he's been
[50:12] he was rejected as a prophet
[50:15] &gt;&gt; of God because he condemned every
[50:18] denomination. See, that's he was a
[50:20] friend to every denomination until he
[50:23] started to tell them, "You're deceiving
[50:26] the people.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; You are not preaching the word.
[50:32] You're preaching traditions. You're
[50:34] preaching creeds. You're preaching
[50:37] everything but the word of God." See,
[50:39] that's when they didn't want nothing to
[50:41] do with him. That's when they rejected
[50:44] him. That's when they said, "You know
[50:45] what? I heard I heard Copelan say just
[50:48] just
[50:49] uh he had a they had a big conference
[50:51] and they were talking about all these
[50:53] great generals of God and and he says,
[50:55] "Yeah, you know, Brother Brandham
[50:56] visions and oh, I was in his meetings."
[50:58] He said, "But they wanted to be
[51:00] teachers." He should have stuck with the
[51:02] prophetic.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; And I love what brother Brandham says.
[51:05] How can I teach them the prophetic gifts
[51:09] if they don't know the ABCs? If they
[51:11] don't obey God, how are you going to get
[51:12] anything?
[51:14] &gt;&gt; That's what God did. He He look at what
[51:16] Israel's back in their land today and
[51:18] they were sent all over the world
[51:20] because they failed to obey God.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Because they had the power. Look at
[51:26] Solomon, the greatest kingdom ever.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; And the Palestines don't take that
[51:33] evidence of Solomon. Oh, they don't want
[51:35] to hear it. That's why they don't want
[51:36] any archaeology there. They don't want
[51:38] you to dig up anything because you're
[51:40] going to find out that it was the
[51:42] children of Israel's land. Amen.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; See, he he preached against every
[51:50] denomination.
[51:51] They had forsaken God's word to follow
[51:53] their own ways contrary to the word of
[51:54] God by claiming they are doing it for
[51:56] Jesus Christ's sake. Anything done for
[51:59] his sake has to be word on word. And
[52:01] even today, I see the message. I I see
[52:04] little things coming. I see that we want
[52:07] to get back to the manifestations of
[52:09] flesh.
[52:15] You know what? I love spirited singing.
[52:19] I love moving. But that's not a sign of
[52:24] evidence of the Holy Ghost.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Speaking in tonesues, you know, the
[52:28] devil can speak in tonesues.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; And and it and it's correct. I mean,
[52:33] brother Bram said he went to Mishawaka.
[52:35] He said one man was just a just he was
[52:38] just a there was ever a a man, you know,
[52:41] he was he was an adulterer
[52:45] &gt;&gt; and and and interpreting and speaking in
[52:47] tongues and and the other one was a real
[52:49] saint and and a real seed of God.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah. See, when the anointing like and I
[52:56] I I use this all the time and I'm I'm at
[52:58] a new church, so I can do this,
[53:01] you know, I can take this water and I
[53:03] can just
[53:05] you can you say you were anointed,
[53:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[53:11] &gt;&gt; You can say I was anointed.
[53:34] The faith anchored.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; The faith anchored.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; The faith took hold.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; So we have to examine our ways right
[53:45] now. Are we coming to the final days of
[53:47] our journey here on earth where the
[53:48] coming of the Lord is very night at
[53:50] hand? Even if the whole world repented
[53:53] tonight, right now, we lose this earth
[53:56] beyond redemption unless it is cleansed
[54:00] by holy fire.
[54:03] We if every person repented and sought
[54:07] the Lord, it's we're we're too far gone.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; We need the holy fire of God. It's like
[54:13] brother Ram says that earth isn't going
[54:15] to be annihilated. It's just going to be
[54:18] cleansed by God's fire.
[54:24] See, it's going to have to be brought
[54:26] back to its original state.
[54:31] And when you look at it today,
[54:35] it seems the earth is without form and
[54:37] void
[54:38] &gt;&gt; spiritually.
[54:40] And darkness is upon the whole face of
[54:43] the deep. And darkness is upon the whole
[54:45] earth. There's darkness. Wherever you
[54:47] look, there's darkness. Why?
[54:51] Because they refused the light.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; And the spirit of God moved upon the
[54:57] face of the waters and it divided this
[55:00] the light and the darkness. And God came
[55:03] in this day to bring light to us. And
[55:05] the ones that receive light will have
[55:07] light. The rest of them are still in
[55:08] darkness. They're under the the
[55:11] darkness, pitch darkness, and they can't
[55:15] and they don't have any form
[55:18] and they've losing their minds.
[55:23] God spoke, formed everything, and when
[55:25] he comes and speaks judgment, he's going
[55:27] to cleanse everything. Now, we need to
[55:29] bring ourselves to his presence and be
[55:31] cleansed and take every possession we
[55:33] are entitled to take. And as Caleb took
[55:36] Hebron, as he desired it to be his, he
[55:39] took it and was successful because he
[55:42] received the word of the angel that
[55:43] promised it for him. Wherever your feet
[55:45] are, you shall possess the land. And
[55:49] I'll say today, we can possess the
[55:52] complete fullness of God tonight. If we
[55:56] will say, Lord, it's mine.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Lord, it's mine. I don't know how you're
[56:00] going to do it, Lord, but I'm I am
[56:03] submitting. See, we got to bring
[56:05] ourselves into submission to the word of
[56:08] God and God will take control of it.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; See, if we can submit ourselves, it
[56:12] means humble ourselves, that means that
[56:14] we can we can take
[56:18] and allow God to lead us.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; And he might use brother Moses. He might
[56:24] use Brother Zeg. He might use I should
[56:26] know that brother over there. I forget
[56:28] his first name.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Dan
[56:32] Stewart.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Stewart.
[56:35] Peter, go Moses,
[56:40] Philip. He can use anyone
[56:44] &gt;&gt; by the spirit
[56:47] to bring you
[56:49] correction.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[56:51] &gt;&gt; bring you into the word,
[56:54] lead you further.
[56:56] But we have to be able to take that and
[56:59] and you know, you say, "Well, I I just
[57:01] don't want to listen to anybody, brother
[57:02] Jonah. I I I just don't want to be
[57:04] deceived. I had somebody say to me,
[57:05] "Well, that's why I only listen to tapes
[57:08] because then I then I'm not going to be
[57:09] deceived." Well, you know what? I'll
[57:11] tell you what. If you've taken if you
[57:13] only listen to tapes, then you're not
[57:14] doing what the tape said.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; And unfortunately,
[57:22] who hears the voice of the prophet is
[57:24] the one who obeys the prophet.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; That's who hears. Amen.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Not the one who just hears.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; The the the doers of the word are
[57:34] blessed,
[57:35] &gt;&gt; not the hearers,
[57:38] &gt;&gt; but it takes the hearing of the word to
[57:40] receive faith in order to become a doer
[57:43] of the word. That's
[57:43] &gt;&gt; right.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; But we've got to, you know, and I don't
[57:47] discount them.
[57:49] I I'll tell you, I don't discount those
[57:51] people because I just believe that God's
[57:53] got to give them life to show that you
[57:56] know what, you need a pastor
[57:59] because there are things that happen in
[58:01] the world. There's things that are that
[58:03] are taken place since the prophet has
[58:05] left that we need a pastor. Who you
[58:08] going to who's going to baptize you? You
[58:10] need a pastor.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; I mean, there's people getting married
[58:14] by the prophet with, you know, and
[58:16] they're doing that. I mean, it's just it
[58:17] it seems to me like idol worship.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; It seems to me like idol worship.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Cuz we're looking at a man
[58:29] and and he's our like if if Brother
[58:31] Bram's your pastor, you're an idol
[58:33] worshipper
[58:35] &gt;&gt; because God needs live pastor.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; He needs a live pastor. That That's my
[58:41] my opinion
[58:43] &gt;&gt; and I believe it's according to the
[58:45] word. Amen.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; So, let me just end with this because
[58:49] usually I'm a half hour preacher,
[58:51] brother. And that's that's all I do on
[58:53] Wednesday.
[58:54] Look, we are at the Jordan River, the
[58:57] same as Israel was. They had journeyed
[59:00] for 40 years circling till all the
[59:02] original ones leaving Egypt had died
[59:04] except for Joshua and Caleb. The rest
[59:06] didn't trust that God had spoken to
[59:08] Moses, you see, and couldn't go over.
[59:11] They perished never to ever enter into
[59:12] God's rest. And you might say, "Well,
[59:14] they followed him for 40 years. They
[59:16] must have believed him." No, they didn't
[59:17] believe him because they didn't cross
[59:19] over.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; And that's the same thing today. If you
[59:21] aren't obeying the message of the hour,
[59:23] but you're just hearing it
[59:26] &gt;&gt; and you're not obeying it, that means
[59:28] you don't have faith.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; You don't have rapturing faith. You'll
[59:31] never get rapturing faith by just
[59:33] hearing. You've got to do what he said.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; That's a sign. You know when you tell
[59:38] your kids, how can you tell a good kid
[59:40] you got good kids?
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Is when they do what you tell them,
[59:46] &gt;&gt; right, Liam?
[59:50] How can you tell you got good grandkids
[59:52] when you tell them don't go and they
[59:53] stop?
[59:57] &gt;&gt; He's a good grandkid. He's too smart for
[59:59] his own.
[1:00:02] See, we've had a great falling away.
[1:00:04] People now say after following the
[1:00:06] message for 34 years, he wasn't the
[1:00:08] prophet sent even with great vindication
[1:00:10] because somebody on the internet has
[1:00:12] said so.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Either you are a believer or not. You
[1:00:16] know what I always like to tell those
[1:00:18] people this
[1:00:20] 500 people seen
[1:00:23] Jesus after he was resurrected. 500
[1:00:27] people. How many people made it to the
[1:00:30] upper room?
[1:00:34] 120.
[1:00:37] I always say Jesus the greatest preacher
[1:00:39] on earth.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; The greatest preacher on earth and one
[1:00:45] was the devil.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; You know Jesus taught us not to pull
[1:00:51] that tear
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; before it's time.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Because if he would have pulled that
[1:00:56] tear before its time, he might have
[1:00:57] pulled Peter out. He might have pulled
[1:01:00] James out and John out.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; And so, you know what? We've got to
[1:01:04] follow the leading of the Lord.
[1:01:07] And we've got to stick to the word and
[1:01:10] stick to his his his what he has said.
[1:01:14] You know, they said Jesus Christ was
[1:01:16] stolen away.
[1:01:19] They said he never resurrected. His
[1:01:21] disciples ate his body.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; They stole his body.
[1:01:26] And they're still saying those things
[1:01:28] today.
[1:01:30] You know what?
[1:01:33] But we have a word.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; And I know that I know that Jesus is the
[1:01:39] same. I know that I believe the truth. I
[1:01:41] know it.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; How do you know you're saved? You can't
[1:01:48] show it to somebody.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you what, you know it when
[1:01:51] when you're saved. You know Jesus has
[1:01:54] taken possession. I can tell when
[1:01:56] somebody has taken possession of Jesus.
[1:01:59] You know how I can tell? They talk about
[1:02:02] Jesus.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; They witness about Jesus.
[1:02:06] And that's what the greatest thing that
[1:02:08] I've been doing for two years, I've been
[1:02:10] telling my congregation, if you're not
[1:02:12] witnessing,
[1:02:14] that means you haven't had a real
[1:02:15] experience.
[1:02:19] And witnessing
[1:02:22] is
[1:02:24] a burden for the lost.
[1:02:28] And we have to have it.
[1:02:31] The gospel can only be believed by
[1:02:33] faith. And you can only receive the Holy
[1:02:35] Ghost by obeying the word of God, which
[1:02:37] takes faith. So saints, let's take faith
[1:02:40] and believe to the end that he's coming.
[1:02:42] And let's take our mountain. Let's take
[1:02:44] faith in God's word.
[1:02:46] We need to stand and believe that he
[1:02:48] hears us and that his word cannot change
[1:02:51] and it will not change.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; I'll read you with this scripture and
[1:02:56] then I'll close.
[1:02:58] Philippians 48.
[1:03:03] It says, "Finally, brethren, whatsoever
[1:03:06] things are true, whatsoever things are
[1:03:09] honest, whatsoever things are just,
[1:03:12] whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever
[1:03:15] things are lovely, whatsoever things are
[1:03:18] of good report, if there be any virtue,
[1:03:20] if there be any praise, think on these
[1:03:26] things." And if you think as a man
[1:03:29] thinks, it says in Proverbs, so is he.
[1:03:36] I pray that the Lord would bless you
[1:03:39] here
[1:03:41] at this fellowship at Restored Word.
[1:03:44] That he would just come down with his
[1:03:47] power, with his might.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; And that he would just musicians come
[1:03:52] and that he would just send a little
[1:03:55] revival.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; You know, I I don't believe the world's
[1:03:58] going to see a revival, but I believe
[1:03:59] the bride will have a little revival.
[1:04:01] Amen.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; And I believe that revival is going to
[1:04:04] start
[1:04:06] in individual hearts.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; And I believe that the Lord wants to
[1:04:11] revive us.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; So let's just stand and let's pray and
[1:04:15] then we'll sing that song. I need you,
[1:04:16] Lord. Can Can we sing that?
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord.
[1:04:20] Right now.
[1:04:22] Lord, I thank you tonight that we could
[1:04:24] come together.
[1:04:26] Lord, I thank you that you have given us
[1:04:29] thy word,
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; faith in thy word. You've given us, Lord
[1:04:33] Jesus, the power of salvation. You've
[1:04:37] given us light over the things of thy
[1:04:41] word that we might walk in truth, Lord,
[1:04:43] and that we might do the things that you
[1:04:46] want us to do, that we might be ready
[1:04:48] for thy coming, Lord. Lord, touch every
[1:04:50] heart. Touch Brother Moses. Touch
[1:04:52] Brother Zigg. touch every brother here
[1:04:54] tonight, Lord Jesus, that has need of
[1:04:56] you. Amen.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Lord, that you would lead them, that you
[1:05:00] would guide them, that you would just,
[1:05:03] Lord, take hold of them. And Lord, give
[1:05:05] them the power to stand, Lord Jesus, in
[1:05:09] this dark and adulterous generation.
[1:05:12] Lord, we need the power to stand. The
[1:05:14] power to stand and Lord, be a light for
[1:05:17] you. Lord, touch every heart here
[1:05:19] tonight. Touch those that are streaming
[1:05:21] in tonight, Lord, that would desire,
[1:05:23] Lord, just to be touched by thy
[1:05:25] presence, to come closer to you and just
[1:05:28] have an attitude change. Lord, you can
[1:05:30] do it because you promised it.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; I need you, Lord.
[1:05:41] I need you, Lord,
[1:05:44] right now.
[1:05:47] [Music]
[1:05:50] I need you, Lord.
[1:05:54] I need you, Lord,
[1:05:57] right now.
[1:06:01] [Music]
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; I lift my hands
[1:06:08] and bow my knees
[1:06:12] and worship
[1:06:14] at your throne.
[1:06:18] [Music]
[1:06:20] I need you, Lord.
[1:06:24] I need you, Lord,
[1:06:27] right now.
[1:06:32] I need you, Lord.
[1:06:36] I need you, Lord.
[1:06:39] right now.
[1:06:42] [Music]
[1:06:45] I need you, Lord.
[1:06:49] I need you, Lord,
[1:06:53] right now.
[1:07:00] I lift my hands
[1:07:04] and bow my knees
[1:07:08] and worship
[1:07:11] at your throne.
[1:07:15] I need you Lord.
[1:07:20] I need you Lord
[1:07:23] right now.
[1:07:28] Wasn't that wonderful?
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Was that marvelous?
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Let's give a hand to the Lord this
[1:07:34] evening.
[1:07:40] [Applause]
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Jonah, I really enjoyed it. I
[1:07:44] really enjoyed it. God bless you,
[1:07:46] Richley. I really enjoyed very good good
[1:07:50] good stuff I learned this evening.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Thank God for that.
[1:07:56] If brother Jonah can be rude, oh uh God
[1:08:00] have mercy on us.
[1:08:03] If they consider him to be rude the way
[1:08:05] he's preaching and that softness then oh
[1:08:09] what about the others? Oh God have mercy
[1:08:11] on us.
[1:08:14] Oh brother Jonah we we love you. I
[1:08:16] almost say that that I almost say that
[1:08:18] at the beginning. Just listen how he's
[1:08:21] going to preach. is going to be it's
[1:08:23] going to be this that humility and and
[1:08:25] softness but good things will come out
[1:08:27] just just watch just watch and and and
[1:08:31] just you just saw how it is right little
[1:08:34] then he's poking at you he's telling you
[1:08:36] the truth right but he's just so soft
[1:08:39] and oh realize oh actually I've been
[1:08:41] just it's been unveiled there but oh and
[1:08:45] oh we appreciate you brother John I
[1:08:48] seriously
[1:08:50] and we thank God for that and that that
[1:08:52] attitude that that that's what we should
[1:08:54] be
[1:08:56] God we need you more and more ledia does
[1:08:59] not think that they don't need God the
[1:09:02] more you think that you don't need God
[1:09:04] then you're on the way in the way way
[1:09:06] way down but when you realize Lord no
[1:09:10] matter how many years I've been in the
[1:09:11] message no matter I was I grew up in the
[1:09:14] message or no matter Lord constantly I
[1:09:17] need you actually the more you serve God
[1:09:20] the more realize that oh I need him more
[1:09:23] and more. I depend on him on every step
[1:09:26] because it's it it it's getting it's
[1:09:30] getting tighter if I can put this by
[1:09:32] lack of words getting tighter at the
[1:09:35] junction of time. We are living in the
[1:09:37] junction of time
[1:09:39] and right there it's a if you don't have
[1:09:42] the right attitude and you just go
[1:09:44] without knowing it and you think that
[1:09:46] you know it all and everything and it's
[1:09:48] just the wrong attitude and you go but
[1:09:51] God give us that right attitude right
[1:09:54] approach constantly all the time Lord
[1:09:57] help us to have the right attitude
[1:09:59] because the right attitude will make
[1:10:02] every promise of God come to pass. Amen.
[1:10:06] If you look at the Caleb and and Joshua,
[1:10:10] they saw the same things. They saw the
[1:10:12] same challenge, some same challenges,
[1:10:15] the same giants, the same obstacles.
[1:10:18] They went in the desert 40 years. They
[1:10:21] saw the same thing over and the good
[1:10:24] things, but also the negative things. I
[1:10:26] like what he said. Two out of
[1:10:30] two millions. Think about it. Two out of
[1:10:33] two millions. If you have a church of
[1:10:36] two millions and only two are faithful,
[1:10:40] think about it. Oh wow. Will be
[1:10:42] discouraged. I mean, seems like I'm the
[1:10:45] only one saying amen in church. I'm only
[1:10:48] because two million don't show up.
[1:10:49] They're just doing their own stuff.
[1:10:54] Oh my.
[1:10:57] Oh, God help us.
[1:11:00] two millions two millions criticizing
[1:11:03] each other and talking about the other
[1:11:04] things and we see what Moses did and no
[1:11:07] it's not anointed and let's move back
[1:11:09] and complain murmuring and everything
[1:11:13] and you are in that church member of
[1:11:14] that church but you don't look at that
[1:11:17] you focus on Christ
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; focus on Christ Lord keep my mind stayed
[1:11:21] on you keep my mind stayed on the
[1:11:24] promise Abon belongs to me belongs to me
[1:11:28] no matter the the giant no matter
[1:11:30] obstacles. Abon belongs to me. Amen. My
[1:11:33] husband doesn't believe it. That is the
[1:11:35] problem. My AB belongs to me. My wife
[1:11:37] doesn't believe it. That's the problem.
[1:11:39] Abs belongs to me.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Oh God, help us Lord to have that right
[1:11:43] attitude.
[1:11:44] Help us Lord. Help us to have that right
[1:11:47] attitude.
[1:11:51] Really enjoyed it. Let's give Lord a
[1:11:54] little bit of 10 minutes of prayer to
[1:11:55] the Lord just from what we have heard.
[1:11:57] If you can Lord, keep your mind stayed
[1:11:59] on me. You know that song? I'll try it.

[1:14:42] prayer individually. Speak to the Lord
[1:14:45] this evening that we have heard such a
[1:14:48] wonderful message this evening as the
[1:14:51] music is playing softly for us.
[1:14:55] Father, we thank you.
[1:14:58] Thank you for your presence, Lord, this
[1:15:00] evening.
[1:15:02] Thank you, Father, for the word of God
[1:15:04] that came
[1:15:06] spoke to our heart, Father, to remind us
[1:15:09] to have the right attitude.
[1:15:12] Lord we pray God that you change our
[1:15:15] mind. You change the way of thinking
[1:15:18] father
[1:15:20] we think on you constantly father on the
[1:15:23] promise of God not to feed our mind with
[1:15:26] different things or different voices
[1:15:29] but just to feed upon
[1:15:32] the voice of God so that we can have the
[1:15:35] mind of God. We desire to be changed
[1:15:39] transformed. I desire to be changed,
[1:15:41] transformed by the renewing of my mind,
[1:15:44] Father, through the Holy Spirit to have
[1:15:47] the right attitude of Christ.
[1:15:50] Father Lord, as we are now crossing into
[1:15:52] the land of the Holy Ghost, the promised
[1:15:55] land, Father, Lord Jesus Christ, help
[1:15:58] us, Lord, to keep the right, the right
[1:16:02] mind, the right attitude, the right
[1:16:04] approach
[1:16:06] as Joshua, as Caleb, Father Lord, to
[1:16:09] claim the promise of God despite the
[1:16:12] circumstances, despite the obstacles,
[1:16:15] despite, Father Lord, the challenges,
[1:16:18] but the Lord is
[1:16:20] but not to rely on our emotions but our
[1:16:23] emotions can be up and down but help us
[1:16:26] our emotion to be constant control under
[1:16:30] the leadership of the Holy Ghost. Help
[1:16:33] us father Lord Jesus Christ. We thank
[1:16:35] you for your word. We accept it. We say
[1:16:37] amen.
[1:16:39] Change father Lord our attitude. Change
[1:16:42] our way of thinking father. As we feed
[1:16:45] more on the word of God, our thinking
[1:16:47] will be changed. our mind will be
[1:16:49] changed and like the Holy Spirit father
[1:16:51] as we welcome your word this evening.
[1:16:53] You said father if we receive the word
[1:16:55] we'll become the word father we receive
[1:16:58] the word speak into heart correcting us
[1:17:03] molding us father lord shaping us lord
[1:17:06] Jesus Christ because you desire us you
[1:17:08] want us lord to come to the full stature
[1:17:11] of perfect man the full stature of
[1:17:13] Christ father Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:17:16] greatest battle ever thought is in the
[1:17:19] mind is in the way of the attitude
[1:17:22] father god about the difference between
[1:17:25] a believer and unbeliever is about
[1:17:27] attitude. The prophet speaks about that
[1:17:30] Syrian Syrian woman. Father Lord,
[1:17:34] despite the challenge, despite the
[1:17:35] rejection, but Lord, she kept the right
[1:17:38] attitude, the right approach, says Lord
[1:17:41] Jesus Christ, give me even the cramps,
[1:17:44] the cramps, Father, even the dogs can
[1:17:46] feed from the cramps, Lord. Father Lord
[1:17:49] Jesus Christ, this this evening we pray
[1:17:51] give us even the cramps. Father Lord, as
[1:17:54] we keep the right attitude towards your
[1:17:56] word, your word will never fail. Your
[1:17:59] word will never be defeated by the word
[1:18:02] of God will defeat Satan any time, any
[1:18:05] place, under any circumstances.

[1:18:09] that has been reminded to us this
[1:18:11] evening. Gross darkness upon the world,
[1:18:15] but there is light for the bride. Father
[1:18:17] Lord help us to look at the right at the
[1:18:19] light to look at the word to stay
[1:18:22] positive. Father remove away the
[1:18:25] critical spirit. Father the spirit of
[1:18:27] judgment spirit father Lord of complexes
[1:18:31] but give us the heart that is humble
[1:18:34] simple humble simple staying on the word
[1:18:38] of God. Not compromising but be under
[1:18:40] the subjection of the word. As we heard

[1:18:46] be subject to the word of God. Hearing
[1:18:48] your word is not only hearing by the by
