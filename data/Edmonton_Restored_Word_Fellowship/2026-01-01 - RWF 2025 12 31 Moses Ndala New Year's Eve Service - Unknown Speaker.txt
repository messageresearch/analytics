A a child a child uh a child who has been given instruction by his and if he doesn't respect the the same way that his parent has taught him that child will be punished by his parents because a child who is loved by his parents is instructed head or taught by his parents and if he doesn't respect the instruction and the father can punish him. Chastisement is doesn't mean that the parent doesn't love the child. No, but a parent who love his child will uh punish him. If it disobey to any of of the instructions, you'll be punished by the word. [Music] And the parent cannot be I can not feel bad when he punishes his child.

I respect the people who comes here to preach us. I pray Lord for them because you know brothers and sisters this place is not the place of everyone because there the way I see you here. You've seen the little angels that just came to sing for us here.

What they offer to the Lord is the best of those children. They don't have a lot of confusion. Dad brings them here. Mom brings them and mom says, "Come, we will worship the Lord. And when they come here, enter here. Dad said in that place is a holy place. It's a holy place. You can speak. You can do any anything that you like. You cannot play there. It's a holy place where there we are going to to hear the creature the creator to to hear from the Lord who created us in his own image. The gospel of the children start from their homes by the one who showed him how to taught him how to walk. The first step uh the first teaching comes from the fifth gospel.

We taught them how to pray to glorify the Lord and seek the Lord's face. We have a song book called uh the songs of worship songs for salvation. I could sing those songs with my wife before praying till today. It's Rama who's teaching us those songs. Rama, she's the one teaching us those things. I don't know where which university she went to. She's the one teaching us. She was born in Kenya. It's a little It was just a testimony. You are you just got married. You have children. Keep keep doing altar or family prayers at home. It helps a lot. The children there. I can give a testimony. When we came here, divine grace and they were babies like uh children of uh brother Andrew. They are now young ladies. [Music] If we had a lot of young men, we could say, "Oh, we we have sisters here." uh the then they're they're ready. It doesn't take long. Can you imagine how mama Mary she she brought the these children to church today. She's amongst the vessels of the church. She's doing when you are hearing sound system it's sister Shakina was doing that work she has a position in the mystery body of Jesus Christ uh sister Grace sings for us and sister divine plays piano the uh divine gift is it's here to save us all. Brother Frana, those little children, those little kids, those Sunday school kids, don't worry. [Music] What we are giving them here that is what will make the great church of small [Music] [Music] is what will make that the gospel of the lord Jesus Christ be preached in the uh uh routes of uh mountain. Hallelujah. Amen. We are teaching them to respect the servants of God. We are teaching them to respect the prophets of God. We are teaching them to respect the message of the hour. We are teaching them that they have to respect the word of God. We need to be strict teaching them that don't play with the words. If we are living today, it's because of this word. All the governments of the world. If they're still living, it's because of your prayers. It's because of the prayers of the bride of Jesus Christ. Do not be uh All the organization of the world and economic uh ecclesic churches they are not we are still on our knees we are still talking to the to our God. Hallelujah. Amen. Brothers and sisters We have a lot of good things that we can share together. [Music] It's the Lord God who sent him to us in the 20th century. The Lord, the Lord God, he loves us so much. And we can say, I always tell my children, can you imagine in this world? We have a secret that other people do not know, do not have. When Esther had six years a primary school, she came to say, "Dad, I've seen other little children uh girls wearing pants. If she was uh going in a Catholic church, I I told those little girls that no, it's not good." But they did not understand. [Music] Can you give me a scripture that says that I I went and searched and gave that little uh secret I gave it to Esther this chapter this verse you can explain to them they will understand. Do you think they are listening and taking are listening very well to the word of God when they come to church? I did psychology psychology says that a a mother who is pregnant, you are able to speak to that child. If you sing to that child, you sing and she will listen. She's in the womb. If you pray, you pray for her, she will listen. Uh do you understand? Yes. It's not for nothing that the the prophet says that you are fifth gospel. The Bible says there gospel of John, Mark, Matthew and Luke. [Music] Those are the four gospel that we learn in denominations. We went to children of Catholic. Brother Brham was not here when he came. He preached the a message of the hour. And in the message of the I said a a woman a sister filled with the Holy Ghost she's a fifth gospel. I believed to that because I know that he's the messenger of the young just like Moses was the messenger of Israel [Music] uh the the one who could not accept the message of Moses to the un to the people they they they all died pagans they will never go to heaven. Hallelujah. Amen. The people who did not believe the message of Noah, they were uh they were destroyed by waters. Yes. It's it's it's correct. We have to understand that in every age God sends his children. God sends a messenger with a message. And when you receive the message and the message, the reward that God will give to the messenger, you will have accepted the messenger and the message. You will receive the same rewards. Amen. You will receive the same reward. Hallelujah. Amen. Brothers and sisters, we have something to do. And what we have to do, you know, Peter, Andrew, Nathaniel, and all those people during their time, they were waiting for a Messiah. And their parents were speaking about Messiah. When their parents were talking about Messiah, One day it happened that uh the father of brother Peter especially the brother [Music] uh the the the father of brother Peter is the one who taught him how to fish every time he could speak to him about the becoming Messiah. Andrew was receiving the same teaching. Nathaniel was receiving the same teaching because uh during that time every universe was under Roman Empire and the Romans were taking everyone as their slaves. [Music] there all the people of God were under the Romans yoke. They they were saying we cannot keep we cannot continue continue being uh stepped on. Our parents taught us that there will be a coming Messiah to deliver to set us free. And when God sent the Lord Jesus Christ and when the Lord met Peter uh on the sea he was fishing for the whole night and he didn't even catch any little fish. the the Lord was so merful to him and Peter explained the whole situation to him that I've been fishing but I didn't catch anything just take your nest and cast it in the sea on the sea and he replied that master Since my my my my birth, I've been fishing. It's morning. I can't catch anything. But at thy word, I'll do it. And cast he casted the the nets and caught a lot of fish. And Peter said to himself, "Who is this person?" things like this. Maybe he's a messenger, a prophet. Maybe he's the one who we've been waiting. Why? Why? By his word, he can create these things. I I I see that he's a special person. But uh days went by. They they they went and told Nathan that that person is talking about our life. Nathan went and then and you he had doubt in his heart. He was doubting [Music] when he came forth before Jesus said look at this Israelite who doesn't have any problem he doesn't have any sins in in himself he's correct said he told him his name and Everything said a person who can descend the thoughts of a man is not is he not a messiah. Brothers and sisters, brother Brham came. The spirit of God was upon him. He was descending the spirit of men. second pool and the third pool and he did those experience there and we discovered that God was with us just like that's just like he lived in the 20th century God in his fullness he lived in the prophets. Hallelujah. Amen. We we are duty bound to teach our children the respect of the word of God and the respect of the servants of God. We don't have enough time I'm not even one of what I'm trying because there are some who are going to push towards you need to be even the respect of the respect the respect of circumstances. We need to stop. We have to stop. We have Mariam, the sister of Moses. Oh my god. Her and Aaron the sacrif based on evil about Moses the prophet and God strike them with leprosy. God said [Music] when Mariam was strike by leprosy because Aaron had a limit of God. [Music] When you see a pastor, the pastor there, don't speak evil about him. When you are with your kids, don't don't even try to speak evil of the children of God. Maybe you can go and confess to him and God will forgive you. How can your children listen to you speaking of your servants and the child starts speaking of the servant of God? The child doesn't have that descentment to say I must go and ask for forgiveness. Do you not see that it's a criminal act? You've spoken evil about uh evil of the servant of God and the your children are commenting as well. Evil about the servant of God. It means that you've killed your own child. You are killing your child spiritually. It would have been better to give uh good testimonies. If you don't have any good things to say on behalf of your brother, of your brother, just stay quiet. Don't don't say anything at all. It's good to stay quiet shut because you might you may kill your own child spiritually speaking. [Music] Miam. She's the one who who helped. She's the one who who placed the basket of on the sea and they led that basket towards the sister of the daughter of Pharaoh. And the Moses grew up in the royal kingdom of Pharaoh. He was kept very well. He went to school. He went to universities. He was uh fed the stop there that daughter of Pharaoh [Music] and gave scholarship gave to the mother of Moses to he was uh how do you say like paying a fee to feed Moses his child. God is wonderful. When he calls someone, he equips him, keeps him and takes care of him. That's why every servants of God. [Music] They are extraordinary people. [Music] The word of God says, "Don't touch my anointed ones. Don't touch my hand of a servant of God. Uh he can be of the message. Don't don't speak evil. Don't look at those small those who are speaking of brother speaking evil. Don't don't read those stuff. May the Lord God bless you all. I've uh reached at the end of my 30 minutes that was I would have given you a lot of examples able disobeyed He was not respectful to uh uh Elisha the prophet. Elijah was his prophet and pastor of that time. Jezebel didn't respect her respect him and dogs uh drank his his blood. What? Yes. respect because she didn't respect the servant servants of God and didn't respect the instruction of God is to you up to you to me to take these advices. We are we are duty bound to respect all the servants of God, the word of God, the message of our time and let teach our children to respect the word of God and respect and everything that God has given to him. May the Lord God bless you. Amen. May God bless you. We'll continue. I'll just sing couple of songs. Um we just continue program but um just want to to back up what Papa Matendo said here. It's just it was just very good. Did you like it? I I I kind I I really like it. Uh I just I just like it. May God bless you richly. um not necessarily because um because the preacher I respect the preacher but not necessarily because of that but although it's part of the word of God and um but I just want to say it's one of the messages every time I listen to it I say Lord forgive me every single time because it's very easy to make a comment very easy to make a comment. You just see something that doesn't agree with you and then quick you share that with someone. As long as stays with you, you don't feel happy. You you you feel good when you share it with someone else. Then you feel good and and and very often and then sometimes I share with my wife too like something is frustrating me and then and I share with her Then after that I feel content. She doesn't even have to do anything about it to be honest. She has no authority. She just hear it and and it bothers her. That gives her more trouble. But but why do I do that? Oh Lord, forgive me. Forgive me. But um it's good that a deacon can remind us about that good principle. Stephen was was was was a deacon, but he left one great testimony. Even Paul was still remembering what the deacon said. So we should not neglect what the deacons have told us this evening. Lord, help me. Help me to be more respectful. If there is a tomorrow, if there is a next year, Lord, help me to be more respectful. help me to respect my parents, respect my mother, respect my father, to respect just to be respectful. Amen. Can I just take a little moment and then we just just bow our head and just pray and I'm going to say that in terms of myself but also in term of the church it's got to be merciful for anything we have said that was not this place at the right at the right place but the Lord Jesus Christ we humbly we just want to say Lord thank you first of all for the word of God that we have heard for reminding us father Lord Jesus the instructions and what you say as the prophet says in that message many times God demands respect God demands respect doesn't doesn't matter on how the person looks how the person talks sometimes even how they make how they make their mistakes it's not up to us to criticize it's not up to us to neglect it for us Father forgive me. Forgive me. How many times Father Lord I failed. The Holy Spirit has rebuked me many times upon that. Father Lord on behalf of the church on behalf of father all of us Lord we come before you recognizing that we have failed many times that principle but help us father lord help us to stand up lord to keep that no mind that we have to be respectful especially it has been brought to our attention this evening lord for our children for the church of tomorrow help us Lord to be respectful to the word of god to give them the right instruction instructions from early age, Father, to be respectful in the church, to respect the church order, Father, to love the message, Father, not to be respectful to one another, Lord.

I was thinking that I'll be preaching and my theme for this evening was Psalm 105 from 1 to 5. Oh, give thanks unto the Lord. Call upon his name. Make known his deeds among the people. Don't keep it for yourself. Make it known unto the people that our God is good. Sing unto him. Sing psalm unto him. Talk ye of all his wondrous works because he has done so wonderful works in our lives. Glory in his holy name. Let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord. Seek the Lord and his strength. Seek his face ever more. remember his one marvelous works that he had done his wonders and the judgment of his mouth. That's what we are here for to remember the wonderful works of God in our lives and we praise him. Amen. Want to appreciate brother Andrew. Brother Andrew is it okay if I call you for a few words be fine. Appreciate brother Andrew is a I call him my right hand. Um, when he's not in church, I I I'm sorry to say I I I'm nervous. I'm nervous. I I know we don't depend on men, but I I feel a little bit nervous. So, I I just want to give him an opportunity to say a few words. He's a man of few words. So, whatever he just say, I just want to give him a little bit of honor and and appreciate him, my appreciation for him to say a few words. I don't know how few words these are going to be, but we'll we'll see. There's a scripture I did want to read. Philippians 2 1-5. And it says, "If there if there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the spirit, if any bowels and mercies, fulfill ye my joy, that ye be like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind, let nothing be done through strife or vain glory, but in lon of mind. Let each esteem other better than themselves. Look not every man on on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. Let this mind be in you which is also in Christ Jesus. You have your seats. I'm not going to speak on behalf of the pastor, but Uh I only want to talk about what what I I can observe. I guess uh and it says I see see the intent of his heart in his actions and his willingness and his devotion. He wants this church to thrive to grow to increase but not in vain glory in true love and faithfulness in adoration to the Lord strengthened in in one another. He wants this church ruled by the spirit and that's also my desire. This is maybe kind of a little admonishment but I'm not here I'm not a preacher or a pastor. This is just something that's been on my heart having observed and experienced the derision and Satan that Satan tries to put seed amongst brethren. Um I've seen and heard how how churches have split, how people have left claiming faith but missed devotion and brotherly love where the Lord has not had his way. If if you have questions, concerns, doubts in one another, the pastor, bring it before the Lord first. Pray, seek. Don't be hasty. If we cannot resolve problems prayerfully, biblically in our own church. How are we fit to rule, govern with authority, in subjection to Christ on his throne? Is this okay? These are I'm not preaching to anyone. These are my thoughts in my heart for me. And if that's I guess that's just me bearing my heart, but pay your tithe. Tithe tithes give authority in trust. I'm going to say that again. Tithe gives authority and trust. You're giving authority to trust somebody. Tithing tithing states that you are vested in the local church, not just a global church. You can your money anywhere over the world, but you're not vested in somewhere. You're not allowing someone to have authority over you. Come to communion. Communion is affirmation of salvation. Acceptance that the blood applied is enough. When we apply the blood to the doorpost, where we apply blood to the doorpost, we worry when brothers and sisters don't Not because we're worried that they're they're secret sinners. We're worried that they're they don't have the blood applied that they're we want them to be to be saved. We want them to have fellowship with us. I want to see you here. I want to see you worshiping the Lord, not having condemnation, not having self-doubt. We we want you here. And it's this isn't a condemnation. This is an invitation. It's a It's a symbol of Passover, expressing that the blood on the doorpost is enough. And that's something that I realized like a couple years ago, maybe I just never thought about it, but the whole communion is is Passover. And that's how we apply the blood to the doorpost. If I was the one coming out of Egypt and I knew I had to have blood on that doorpost, I'd be out there every day up until the hour the death angel came hosing that doorpost in blood. And and that's what communion is. And you're coming not just for yourself, but for for your brethren. The last couple years, this church has been a little bit in a survival mode. We're wondering, praying, trusting. And the Lord heard the cry of our hearts. He heard our thoughts. what we were wondering. The church is growing. I believe the Lord is moving and don't let the devil get in here. Bind together. If if you have need, bring it before your brothers and sisters. If you have praise, bring it before the church. Aren't we co-airs with Christ? That makes us coairs with one another. We inherit the same thing. We're part of the same blood, part of the same everything. I'm inheriting heaven with you. And that that doesn't is an island on her own. I'm not making it without you. If I've spoken out of place for you, I and I trust if anything was misspoken will correct me. I just just want to take this time maybe to pray for brother Moses and his family and just come to the front and lay hands on just commit him to the Lord before the new year or as part of the new year the whole church You come up here. Lord, heavenly father, we come before you, Lord. We thank you, Lord, for Lord, for hearing our hearts, Lord, for Lord, for knowing our distress, Lord, for Lord, ministering to, Lord, our hearts, Lord. Lord for Lord for knowing the end from the beginning. Lord for Lord for pursuing us Lord more than we deserve. Lord for being an anchor Lord to weary hearts Lord to being a savior Lord for Lord the lost Lord. Lord Lord we're here to give you glory Lord. Lord and we're not asking for anything beyond what you've already provided for us Lord. We're asking, Lord, that you lead us, Lord, that you lead, Lord, our church, not just this church, but globally, Lord, your children, Lord, that we would abide in your word, Lord. Lord, that in all things, Lord, we would we'd be filled with your glory, Lord, filled with your presence, Lord, filled with your discernment, Lord, your grace, Lord, your mercy, Lord. Father, I bring brother Moses and his family, Lord, before you, Lord. We just we ask Lord that you lead them Lord that you comfort them Lord that you give them strength that you lead lead him Lord as a pastor lead his family Lord as Lord and just Lord just guide us Lord we need you Lord to be our shepherd Lord our savior Lord our redeemer Lord Lord and we look to you Lord and we look Lord we just look to your grace Lord Lord lead us Lord Lord, you've given us a shepherd, Lord. Would you give him strength, Lord, to lead us, Lord? Compassion, Lord, and and grace, Lord, and mercy, Lord, and Lord, in us also, Lord. We need compassion and grace, Lord. Lord, for Lord, for for the days to come, Lord. Prepare us, Lord, for your coming, Lord. Prepare us, Lord, for Lord, your kingdom, Lord, the kingdom that we get to be thrown with you, Lord. [Music] That's right. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Thank you for and I just also just want to take this time to to just thank you uh to the brothers and sisters that stepped up recently and and gave your time and your talent. Brother, brother Joseph, brother Peter, sister Wendy, Sister Kina, brother Z, just everyone who's uh like the sisters I help rely reverently you you've relieved some of my stress and my responsibilities. Sometimes I come to church and I'm I'm really stressed out. There's just just through virtue of normal life and and just all just all the things that I have to think about just makes it easier to come to church. And I just want to read that scripture one more time. If there be if there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the spirit, if any bowels and mercies, fulfill ye my joy, that you may be like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind. Let nothing be done through strife or vain glory, but in loneliness of mind. Let each esteem other better than themselves.

Sit for a moment. Did we manage to put the the words in English? We didn't. No. Okay, I will read it for you then. Um, I read quickly the translation of it in English if I can find it. Um so in English says so the chorus says the victory is sure let us know how to rely on Jesus. He who made the promise will not fail to fulfill it. And the verse says, "Let us put on our armor and live as victors or conquerors, for the victory is sure. Let us fight the fight of faith and lay hold of eternal life to which we are called." Says, "Even we have to suffer, let us suffer as victors. Let us guard our hearts from complaint and murmuring. Let us believe in the power of his message as an invincible weapon. Then the crown lies at the hand. Let us work as victors or conquerors. Let us sow in confidence for one day we shall reap. Let each one place at the service of others the gift from God that he has received. Let us re rekindle rekindle rekind rekindle. Let us rekindle our zeal. Let us leave this message that unites our heart in love. Let us be united and strong and may sincere charity guide all our effort. That's a song and just give me a few minutes.
