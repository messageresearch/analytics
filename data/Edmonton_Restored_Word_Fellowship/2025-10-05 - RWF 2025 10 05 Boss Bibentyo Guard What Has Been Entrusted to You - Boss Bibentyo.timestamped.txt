[33:34] have healed me and still be alive."
[33:41] But you're four days late
[33:47] and our hope is gone.
[33:53] Lord, we don't
[33:57] understand why you've waited so long.
[34:04] But his ways, God's ways,
[34:09] not yours are mine.

[36:27] not yours, mine.
[36:32] And his great
[36:36] part is late. He's still tired.
[36:44] Isn't it great when he's 40 days late?

[40:18] you,
[40:20] Lord.
[40:22] I
[40:24] love
[40:26] you. Oh, singing
[40:29] singing. I
[40:32] love you, Lord.
[40:36] Singing.
[40:38] I
[40:40] love you, Lord.
[40:45] Singing. I
[40:48] love
[40:50] you,
[40:52] Lord.
[40:54] I
[40:56] love
[40:58] you.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Bless you.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[41:08] It's a privilege to be here in Edmonton
[41:11] with you.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; I haven't been to this lovely city in a
[41:15] while. I think the last time I was here
[41:17] was probably eight or nine years ago.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you very much. And you all
[41:22] seem like lovely people.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; I'm not here by myself. I'm here with my
[41:28] wife. Her name is Deine as well. She's
[41:30] over there.
[41:35] And uh I came with my two little girls,
[41:39] Allora and Eloise. And I also came with
[41:42] my in-laws of my brother-in-law Sam, my
[41:45] sister-in-law Leia and Sarah. We all
[41:48] came together.
[41:50] [Applause]
[41:53] Uh if you had asked me at the beginning
[41:55] of the week whether I will be in
[41:57] Edmonton. Sure. I didn't know I would be
[41:59] here. But it uh it so happens that my
[42:02] father-in-law who lives in Calgary was
[42:04] sick. So I decided to come and see him.
[42:08] And uh seeing that I was only a few
[42:10] hours away, I said why not? I'll just
[42:13] come and see brother Moses.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; So here we are this morning. I drove
[42:19] from Calgary.
[42:20] I used to think Winnipeg was cold, but I
[42:23] realized that mountain is really cold.
[42:26] So I was showing me on my car there,
[42:28] it's minus 3 and I said, "Lord, I
[42:30] thought Winnipeg was cold, but this one
[42:31] is worse." But uh I just hope that that
[42:36] cold is only outside. Inside we are
[42:38] still warm. All right.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; All right. Uh so uh as the brother said,
[42:44] I'm soft spoke and I don't really
[42:46] scream. And you'll probably notice that
[42:49] my style of preaching is slightly
[42:51] different,
[42:52] &gt;&gt; but the message is the same.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; So, if I say something you don't agree
[42:56] with, find the nearest trash can and
[42:59] throw it there, but don't throw me
[43:01] there. All right? I'm still your
[43:03] brother.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; I still love you.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; And uh we don't I personally don't have
[43:09] a message.
[43:11] uh when God was addressing to the seven
[43:13] church ages,
[43:15] &gt;&gt; he was addressing himself to the angel.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; And every age has an angel
[43:21] &gt;&gt; and the message is to the angel
[43:24] &gt;&gt; and we all are just faithful to receive
[43:27] from the angel
[43:29] &gt;&gt; and to present it to the people of God.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; That is God's way of working.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; So uh I I will not take much time.
[43:38] That's also another thing about me. I
[43:40] don't preach for long. So, uh we will uh
[43:43] we'll probably have a short service.
[43:46] Uh so, if you will stand, we'll go to
[43:48] the reading of the scriptures.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; We'll read in two places and then uh
[43:54] we will add uh our little comments on
[43:57] that and we'll see how the Lord will
[43:59] lead us.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; That's mine. So, first place where we
[44:04] will read from this morning is in
[44:05] Matthew chapter 4.
[44:08] We'll read the first four verses from
[44:10] there and then we'll go to the book of
[44:12] uh Timothy and read from there. So
[44:15] Matthew chapter 4 verse 1 to4. I'm
[44:18] reading the New King James version.
[44:22] The Bible says, are you there?
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Then Jesus was led up by the spirit into
[44:28] the wilderness to be tempted by the
[44:31] devil.
[44:32] And when he had fasted 40 days and 40
[44:35] nights, afterward he was hungry.
[44:39] Now when the tempter came to him, he
[44:41] said, "If you are the son of God,
[44:45] command that these stones become bread."
[44:49] But he answered and said, "It is
[44:52] written." And that is the part I want
[44:55] you to remember. It is written.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Not I heard.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not my pastor said it,
[45:04] &gt;&gt; but God said.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Man shall not live by bread alone,
[45:10] &gt;&gt; but by every word that proceeds from the
[45:13] mouth of God.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; Now we'll go in the second place.
[45:18] It's first Timothy chapter 6. We'll read
[45:21] verse 20 and 21.
[45:25] The Bible says in 1 Timothy chapter 6
[45:28] verse 20 and 21,
[45:31] oh Timothy, this is Paul who's
[45:32] addressing Timothy. He considered him
[45:35] like his own son. So he's addressing to
[45:38] him the way a father would speak to his
[45:40] child. He says, "Oh Timothy,
[45:44] guard what was committed to your trust.
[45:49] Avoid the profane and idol babblings and
[45:54] contradiction of what is falsely called
[45:58] knowledge.
[46:00] By professing it, some have strayed
[46:03] concerning the faith.
[46:06] Grace be with you. Amen.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Let us pray.
[46:14] Gracious Father,
[46:16] we thank you this morning for the
[46:18] opportunity to come into your house.
[46:21] We know as we have read, "Man shall not
[46:24] live by bread alone, but by every word
[46:27] that proceeds out of your mouth.
[46:30] You have given us your word. We have
[46:32] read it. I am a man, Lord. My words will
[46:36] carry death, but your words, they carry
[46:39] spirit and life.
[46:42] May your spirit follow your words, dear
[46:44] God, to quicken them into our hearts
[46:47] &gt;&gt; so that they will be like the seed that
[46:49] fell on good ground,
[46:51] &gt;&gt; yielding forth a hundfold.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Bless your word in the hearts of your
[46:56] children. Myself as a man, I commit my
[47:01] mind, my thoughts, my entire being into
[47:03] your hands.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; I pray that you will use me as a vessel
[47:07] of honor to bless your children.
[47:10] And Lord, I also pray that you'll set me
[47:12] out of their way and just speak through
[47:14] me.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Bless your children as they sit and they
[47:18] listen.
[47:20] Oh Lord, may your word penetrate deep
[47:23] inside their hearts that they will go
[47:25] from here saying like the disciples who
[47:29] heard you speak to them on their way to
[47:30] Emmas. Truly our hearts burnt within us
[47:34] as he spoke to us.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; I pray that you'll forgive our sins,
[47:38] dear God. Amen.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; Wash us and sanctify us in your blood
[47:42] &gt;&gt; so that nothing will hinder your
[47:44] presence from freely moving among us.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Remember the needs in the hearts of your
[47:50] children. Father,
[47:52] &gt;&gt; I am a man. It is pointless for them to
[47:54] tell me their needs. But you are the God
[47:57] who searches the innermost part of a
[47:59] man. And you know our needs because you
[48:02] are a faithful father.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Even before we ask, you're ready to
[48:06] provide. Lord, I pray that you'll grant
[48:09] to each person in here according to
[48:11] their faith in you.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, if there be any sick people
[48:15] among us,
[48:17] &gt;&gt; we have a blessed assurance in the
[48:19] scriptures that says, "I am the God who
[48:21] heals all your diseases." Father,
[48:23] &gt;&gt; with you, there is no disease that is
[48:25] out of the question. Father,
[48:27] &gt;&gt; you are the God who heals it all. And
[48:30] it's by your stripes that we are healed.
[48:32] And by the Holy Spirit, we still have
[48:34] access to those stripes today. and I
[48:36] pray that you'll provide healing
[48:38] whatever trouble your children may have.
[48:40] Lord, you're more than a match for their
[48:42] problems. Father, we bless your name and
[48:45] we invite you in the name of Jesus
[48:47] Christ, we have prayed. Amen.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[48:55] So for a topic this morning,
[48:58] I want to draw from the subject guard.
[49:01] What has been entrusted to you?
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:07] As uh brother said, I come from Winnipeg
[49:12] and in Winnipeg we try to guard what has
[49:15] been entrusted to us.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; And I come to Edmonton. I find you
[49:19] gathered. I know that you're also
[49:21] guarding what has been entrusted to you.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; God bless you, Sister Dein. I remember
[49:26] you're from Winnipeg.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; You know, God has his children
[49:31] everywhere.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the criteria for being a child
[49:34] of God is different.
[49:37] We are not children of God because we
[49:39] come to church.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; The devil also goes to church.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; All right.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; We are not children of God because we
[49:48] believe.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; The Bible says even the devil believes
[49:52] &gt;&gt; and he trembles.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; So what makes you then a child of God?
[49:56] &gt;&gt; You're born by his spirit.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; All right.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; The devil is not born of the spirit of
[50:01] God. You and I are born of the spirit of
[50:04] God.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; And when we are born of the spirit of
[50:06] God, we become partakers of the divine
[50:09] promises that God has given us.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; And through these promises, we have a
[50:15] right to an an inheritance. And that
[50:18] inheritance is the kingdom to come.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; We want to be a part of that kingdom to
[50:23] come. The one that shall never pass
[50:25] away.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Everything that we see here on earth has
[50:29] a beginning. Amen.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Considered something has a beginning. As
[50:33] long as it has a beginning, it has an
[50:34] end.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; But we know that there is a God who has
[50:37] no beginning.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; We know that there is a God who has no
[50:41] end.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; And for you to live eternally, eternity
[50:45] must first come in you.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; And it will transform you from a
[50:49] creature of of time
[50:52] &gt;&gt; to a creature of eternity.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; And we come to church under expectation.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; To receive from him who can only give
[51:01] eternity.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; We can preach the word, you can hear the
[51:06] word, but it will require personal
[51:08] connection with God.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; And uh we just create the right
[51:13] atmosphere for people
[51:14] &gt;&gt; to get into that connection with God and
[51:18] we let God do the rest. Amen.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; So like uh Moses told uh the Lord in
[51:24] Exodus 23, I believe, you know, if
[51:28] you'll not go with us, there is no point
[51:30] sending us.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; You know, you are the God we are coming
[51:34] here to look for.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; You are the God who answers all our
[51:39] needs.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; You are the God who has taken us from
[51:42] Egypt. Now God is faithful. He doesn't
[51:46] take you from Egypt to leave you in the
[51:47] wilderness. Whenever you see someone
[51:50] stop their journey in the wilderness,
[51:52] &gt;&gt; you have to know something. It's not God
[51:54] who left them.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; They left God.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; God never begins something to leave it
[52:01] halfway.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Whatever he begins, he will finish.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; That's what he said about the work of
[52:06] Zerubbabel.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; You can stand against it, but he will
[52:10] finish his work.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; You can doubt it, but he will finish his
[52:14] work. Amen.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; You can say all you want about it, but
[52:17] in the end, God's word will be true, and
[52:20] every man's word will be a lie.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; That means your opinion of what God is
[52:25] is a lie if it doesn't align with the
[52:27] word of God.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Let God be true and
[52:31] every man be a liar."
[52:33] &gt;&gt; So that means your last medical report
[52:35] that said you have cancer is a lie.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Because God didn't say you have cancer.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; That's the doctor who said that.
[52:44] God said
[52:46] by my stripes
[52:48] &gt;&gt; you are healed.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; That also means you may fail in school
[52:56] &gt;&gt; but God didn't call you a failure.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; The teacher can say you failed.
[53:02] The bank may say you're broke. We are
[53:04] going to repossess your your house. We
[53:06] are going to repossess your car. The
[53:08] immigration can say get out of this
[53:10] country.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; But God didn't say that. Amen.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; God says, "I know the plans that I have
[53:16] for you."
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; So now what we need to do
[53:22] &gt;&gt; is to go up to the mountain, go up to
[53:25] God
[53:26] &gt;&gt; and find the plan that he has for us.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Then by faith we pull that plan down to
[53:32] our dimension.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; All right. That's the difference between
[53:36] receiving and possessing.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; All right. We have the promises of God,
[53:40] but we need to possess them. Amen.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; So we possess them by going up and
[53:45] bringing them into our dimension. They
[53:47] become our reality.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; So he says, "I have good plans for you.
[53:50] They are plans of prosperity. They are
[53:52] not plans of sorrow because it is the
[53:55] blessing of the Lord that makes rich."
[53:58] &gt;&gt; And he adds no sorrow to it.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Every blessing that comes with sorrow,
[54:05] then you know where it came from.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; It didn't come from God. No,
[54:09] &gt;&gt; sometimes we want things that God says
[54:11] that's not for you.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we want things God says if you
[54:16] only knew how many tears you'll cry
[54:18] after you got that,
[54:19] &gt;&gt; you wouldn't be crying for that.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; But you see, God being a father,
[54:25] &gt;&gt; sometimes he says the best way to teach
[54:27] you a lesson is to let you shed a few
[54:29] tears.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:33] Because if I keep saying no, no, no, no,
[54:36] no. You will say this man doesn't love
[54:37] me.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; So he says, I'll let you have your way
[54:40] from time to time.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; He won't stop you.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; You know why God will not stop you? God
[54:48] created you in his image.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; And in the in the image of God, you have
[54:55] attributes of God.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; God is sovereign. Amen.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; So what God also does, he also gives you
[55:02] your own sovereignty.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; He gives you free will.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; So there are things God will say, I've
[55:08] given you my word. It's up to you to
[55:11] choose to do it.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; That's why you're in the image of God.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; If you choose to do it, blessed are you.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; If you choose not to do it, you will pay
[55:20] the price.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; All right. Amen.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; So, I'm trying to
[55:27] I'm trying to figure out where we are at
[55:29] here.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't want to go I don't want
[55:33] to go ahead of people. I don't want to
[55:34] go behind you, you know. I want to I'm
[55:37] trying to to discover the depth of the
[55:39] waters that we are swimming in.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Brother.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; All right.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; So, uh and I hope that I don't lose you.
[55:46] You know, my aim has never been to
[55:49] preach mysterious things. Amen.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; My aim is to always take the things and
[55:53] make them simple
[55:55] &gt;&gt; because Christ is revealed in simplicity
[55:59] &gt;&gt; it pleased God to use a servant greater
[56:02] to preach to us the message.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Yet sometimes you try to make the
[56:05] message as if you need a PhD to
[56:07] understand it.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; That is wrong.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; If God wanted us to have all PhDs to
[56:13] know the message, he would have created
[56:17] universities in the Garden of Eden.
[56:21] The only institution that God put in the
[56:23] Garden of Eden was marriage.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; He never put schools.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; He never put prisons.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; He never put, you know, governments.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; You know why God didn't do that? Because
[56:34] you don't need them.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; The only thing that man needs is to
[56:38] figure out where God wants him to be.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; And in there, keep his fellowship with
[56:42] God.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; So Adam, when God created him, God puts
[56:46] him in the Garden of Eden. As long as
[56:48] you are in the Garden of Eden, you keep
[56:51] your fellowship with God, all your needs
[56:53] are taken care of.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; You will not need no government, no
[56:57] hospitals. The minute you fall sick, God
[56:59] is there to heal you.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; How can you be sick when you're feeding
[57:02] on heavenly mana?
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; It's impossible.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; But the minute we walk out of God's
[57:10] plan,
[57:12] then there is where the problem comes
[57:14] in. Death comes in. And you know when
[57:17] death comes in, with death comes
[57:20] sickness,
[57:22] &gt;&gt; old age,
[57:23] &gt;&gt; with death comes you know heart
[57:25] problems,
[57:27] disobedient children. All of that is
[57:29] death calling you.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Death pulling you closer and closer and
[57:33] closer.
[57:37] Before man sinned,
[57:39] he never had to toil to eat.
[57:43] God simply told uh Adam to take care of
[57:46] the garden, but he never told him, "You
[57:49] shall eat at the sweat of your
[57:50] forehead." No, his food was part of
[57:55] God's economy for him.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; But when man sinned, then God said,
[58:00] "Well, go fend for yourself.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Go figure it out."
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Much like teenagers today,
[58:08] you know, you're only 14, you're only
[58:10] 15. You begin to tell your parents, "I
[58:12] cannot wait to go and live on my own."
[58:15] Well, they may laugh at you and say,
[58:17] "You know, child, you don't know what
[58:18] you're talking about.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of your rules in this house."
[58:22] They only look at you and they say, "If
[58:24] you only knew."
[58:26] &gt;&gt; There was something my mother used to do
[58:28] to me when I was a kid. I was in a
[58:30] system where we finished school at
[58:32] around 1:00 p.m. So, I'll go back home
[58:33] and my mom will tell me, "Go take a
[58:35] nap." Say, "Mom, I don't like naps."
[58:38] Says, "Go take a nap. One day you'll
[58:39] appreciate these naps.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; That's true. Amen.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, how I wish someone could take tell
[58:45] me to take a nap today.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Right. You begin to see that they are
[58:52] protecting you.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; But what they call protection,
[58:57] disobedience calls it rules.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; It's disobedience.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; An obedient heart looks at the promises
[59:04] of God and they say, "They are not a
[59:06] burden to me. Yeah,
[59:08] &gt;&gt; they are easy to do.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; So when man sins against God, God kicks
[59:14] him out of the garden, then he has to go
[59:16] and work and toil to get a basic needs.
[59:20] And we we have never had enough. By the
[59:22] way,
[59:23] &gt;&gt; no matter how much you work, you still
[59:26] don't have enough.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; There is no man who can tell you my bank
[59:30] account enough.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Every day has its own needs.
[59:37] But we have a God who shows us the
[59:41] difference. So in Genesis 3, he tells
[59:44] man, you shall eat at the sweat of your
[59:45] forehead.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Now when you go to Matthew 6, what does
[59:50] he tell us? He says, seek first the
[59:53] kingdom of God and its righteousness.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; And then what will happen? Everything
[59:58] else will be added.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Then he tells you, don't worry about
[1:00:03] what you will eat. Don't worry about
[1:00:06] what you will wear. Why? God knows that
[1:00:09] you need those things before you even
[1:00:11] ask for them.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; So when we find people who are stressing
[1:00:15] and worried about these things, that's a
[1:00:18] sign that those people don't know what
[1:00:21] God needs of them.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; I often tell people that there are
[1:00:26] prayers we make to God that we shouldn't
[1:00:28] be making.
[1:00:30] Imagine
[1:00:33] you're praying to God to give you food.
[1:00:37] God says, "I led Israel in the
[1:00:40] wilderness for 40 years.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; I fed them morning and evening."
[1:00:48] And God says, "I am God and I changed
[1:00:52] not."
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; All right, let's go into my topic. I see
[1:00:59] we are together.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; So Paul is speaking to Timothy and he
[1:01:03] tells Timothy guard what was committed
[1:01:06] to your trust.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; This implies that there is something
[1:01:13] that Timothy received that is of great
[1:01:16] value and Paul is giving him advice
[1:01:22] to protect and cherish the thing that he
[1:01:25] was given.
[1:01:26] There is a trust
[1:01:29] that God puts in you.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Because God and his word are one.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; You cannot separate God from his word
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; to make him any other thing but his
[1:01:42] word.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in the beginning was the
[1:01:46] word.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word. Now when
[1:01:51] you go to Revelation, I believe it's in
[1:01:53] Revelation 19 and you see the white
[1:01:56] horse rider who's coming with a sword
[1:01:59] and you see the word that is written on
[1:02:01] him for his name. It is the word of God.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; So in the beginning there is the word in
[1:02:06] the end shall be the word.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; All right. So you and I we have to
[1:02:12] always remember that God cannot be
[1:02:15] detached from his word and remain God.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:20] That's possible.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; You and I are also God's word.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Because God spoke us into existence.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; In Genesis 1, God said, "Let us make man
[1:02:33] in our image."
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; God spoke man. He created man out of
[1:02:41] nothing in his image.
[1:02:43] That man that God created in Genesis 1,
[1:02:47] the Bible says he was a spirit.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Because in Genesis chapter 2,
[1:02:53] the Bible tells us there was no man on
[1:02:56] earth to teal the ground.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Yet God had already created.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; So when God goes into Genesis chapter 2,
[1:03:05] he doesn't create again.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; God goes and he forms man from the dust
[1:03:10] of the earth. Now remember to form is to
[1:03:14] make something out of something else. So
[1:03:17] the Bible says he forms man from the
[1:03:19] dust of the earth. So the dust was there
[1:03:22] he forms you. And brother Brandham says
[1:03:24] in his days the dust that made each one
[1:03:27] of us was a few cents. I believe 80
[1:03:29] cents.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; But the spirit
[1:03:36] you can't put a price on it.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when the Bible says that God so
[1:03:43] loved the world, you look at yourself
[1:03:46] and you say, "God loved me."
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Then the question is this, what about me
[1:03:51] did God love?
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; What about me did God love so much that
[1:03:58] he gave his only begotten son?
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Now we are beginning to step into our
[1:04:04] topic.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. He gave his only begotten son for
[1:04:10] something that he loved.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Now you don't have to worry about that
[1:04:14] thing is it is you.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Now forgive the word thing but I want
[1:04:18] you to picture yourself as an object for
[1:04:20] a second.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Okay? God so loved you that he gave his
[1:04:25] only begotten son for you.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then he says, "If you will believe
[1:04:34] on his son,
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; you will not perish."
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; You will have eternal life.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; If you will believe in his son, now this
[1:04:48] son, the Bible says he is the word made
[1:04:52] flesh.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; That is who the son of God is.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the son of God is God in bodily
[1:04:59] form.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; We called him Jesus Christ.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; After his death and his resurrection,
[1:05:08] he went back to being God.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; But now we have the grace of knowing
[1:05:14] that if we ever look for a name for that
[1:05:17] man, we shall call him Jesus Christ.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; That's right. Because when Paul was
[1:05:23] walking on his way to Damascus, he met
[1:05:25] the great pillar.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; The same great pillar that led Israel,
[1:05:30] Paul now meets it along the way. Paul
[1:05:33] asks that pillar, "Who are you?"
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; He doesn't say, "I'm Elohim."
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Why? Revelation has gone a step further.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; In the beginning, Elohim was there, the
[1:05:46] self-existing one, but no one had known
[1:05:49] him yet as Christ.
[1:05:52] He became God when he had objects to
[1:05:55] worship him.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; But now he has become a man
[1:06:00] like you and I.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; He has walked on this earth. He knows
[1:06:05] the burden of working 8 hours a day.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; He knows the burden of going a few days
[1:06:11] without food.
[1:06:13] He knows the burden of being so tired
[1:06:15] that you sleep in the midst of a storm.
[1:06:18] He knows all of those things.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; So there is no situation that you have
[1:06:22] gone through that you can say God you
[1:06:25] don't know what I'm talking about.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; So that means you are without excuse.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; If he overcame and you truly believe
[1:06:33] that he is living in you.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; You must also overcome.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; So now we know what has been committed
[1:06:40] to us. That which has been committed to
[1:06:44] us is Christ not in human form anymore,
[1:06:48] but it is Christ in spirit form coming
[1:06:52] to dwell in us.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; We call that the Holy Spirit.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Now that Holy Spirit, Paul is telling
[1:06:59] us, guard what has been committed to
[1:07:03] you.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Picture this.
[1:07:08] You know, when you have a few gold bars
[1:07:10] in this world, they're worth a few
[1:07:14] thousand dollars maybe. You feel so
[1:07:17] insecure about walking with them in your
[1:07:19] pocket.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; You go to a bank and you open a deposit,
[1:07:22] a safe
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; and you say, "Guard this for me.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Protect it." We sign a contract that you
[1:07:28] cannot lose it.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; And if you lose it, you will repay me
[1:07:31] the value of that gold.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Now, God's son is worth more than the
[1:07:35] gold. Amen.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Yet we don't take as much time to
[1:07:40] protect him.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; We have to guard the son of God in us.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; We have to guard and protect the Holy
[1:07:50] Spirit in us.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Because the Holy Spirit is more valuable
[1:07:56] than anything.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; That we can receive in this world.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:02] So guard what has been committed to you.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Are we still together?
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Well, you can say, "Well, brother Boss,
[1:08:10] I don't have the Holy Spirit yet." If
[1:08:12] that's your condition, I would say, "God
[1:08:14] bless you." It takes sincerity to
[1:08:16] realize you don't have what you need.
[1:08:19] Because pride will make you believe you
[1:08:21] have what you don't need.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Pride will make you believe you have the
[1:08:27] Holy Ghost when indeed you're still a
[1:08:29] sinner.
[1:08:30] Because brother Brham says the devil is
[1:08:32] good at confusing people.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; He will go to those that have it and try
[1:08:36] to make them believe they don't have it.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; And then he will go to those who don't
[1:08:40] have it and make them believe that they
[1:08:42] have it. You see how the devil works?
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; All right. He goes to Eve and he tells
[1:08:47] Eve, God knew if you eat from this tree,
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; you will be like God.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; You see the lie?
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; You will be like God. But you're already
[1:09:00] in the image of God.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; You will be like God. He is good at
[1:09:10] twisting the word. Twisting the word.
[1:09:13] Twisting the word with one purpose to
[1:09:16] get you out of God's program.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; And then when you get out of one go out
[1:09:21] of God's program, he says, "I got you."
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; He's very subtle.
[1:09:29] So guard what was committed to you.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; So uh if you're projecting the verse
[1:09:36] Paul tells Timothy verse 20 verse 20 he
[1:09:39] says avoid the profane and idol
[1:09:43] bubblings.
[1:09:45] In other words avoid useless talk.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; I want to take a minute just to to
[1:09:54] emphasize on that.
[1:09:57] You know, not not every talk is useful.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; There are some conversations that are
[1:10:06] nothing but a waste of time.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; That is true.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Do you think
[1:10:14] when Pilate was asking Jesus Christ all
[1:10:16] those questions,
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; when the scribes and the chief priests
[1:10:21] were asking Jesus the questions and he
[1:10:23] remained silent, was because he didn't
[1:10:24] have anything to say?
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:10:28] at the cross.
[1:10:31] Do you think he only said a few words
[1:10:33] because he had nothing to say?
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; So you have to watch what you say.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Because the devil
[1:10:44] the devil knows
[1:10:47] that if he can get you
[1:10:50] to grieve the Holy Spirit,
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; he got you.
[1:10:55] And the easiest way to grieve the Holy
[1:10:58] Spirit is to speak words
[1:11:01] because words are powerful.
[1:11:06] He will bring you a situation.
[1:11:09] Look at Peter. There is no doubt that
[1:11:12] Peter loved Jesus.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Now love
[1:11:17] doesn't mean overcoming.
[1:11:20] I want you to remember that.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. There are some men who cheats on
[1:11:24] their wife and they say, "Honey, I still
[1:11:25] love you."
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; There are some people who go to the
[1:11:30] divorce court and they say, "It's just
[1:11:33] irreconcilable differences, but we still
[1:11:34] love each other."
[1:11:38] Love doesn't mean overcoming.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; There is a part that you have to do on
[1:11:44] top of loving.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; You have to obey.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:49] So Peter in his zeal, in his love for
[1:11:54] Jesus, he tells Jesus, "Master, if I
[1:11:57] have to die with you,
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; I will die with you."
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, he was so confident.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; It's like brothers and sisters today, me
[1:12:06] and this message, we shall die together.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; So serious when they're saying it.
[1:12:15] so serious when they're telling you,
[1:12:17] "Brother, if the prophet said it, I
[1:12:19] believe it."
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; And we say, "Amen."
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "Don't stay home when
[1:12:27] the doors are open."
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; You did not see that coming, right?
[1:12:42] Oh my.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; There are things out of zeal and love we
[1:12:52] claim.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; But when it comes to facing the
[1:12:56] situation, as we say, walking the walk.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my. You see, God knows our
[1:13:04] weaknesses.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Then we begin to justify
[1:13:10] Then we begin to show as if God has some
[1:13:13] people he favors over others.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; It's not the case.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; So that's why we began by reading, "Man
[1:13:22] shall live by every word that proceeds
[1:13:24] out of the mouth of God."
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; There is no word of God that is of any
[1:13:30] less value than another.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; When we begin to ascribe value to one,
[1:13:36] we are greater than God.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:39] What God said, you believe it.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Take God at his word.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says full obedience to the
[1:13:49] word of God entitles you to the talcan.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Okay? Full, complete, total obedience to
[1:13:58] the word of God.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; So in other words, there is none of that
[1:14:01] word that you put aside.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; You know what full obedience means?
[1:14:08] Recognizing when you're wrong.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Now, this is where sisters, I need you
[1:14:15] to pray for me.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Because sisters easily accept when they
[1:14:20] are wrong.
[1:14:21] But the man,
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; you see, they are the only ones who are
[1:14:25] saying amen.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; I need you to pray for me. I'm here
[1:14:32] alone.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; The man
[1:14:42] Ah, yes. I will I will
[1:14:46] [Laughter]
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; It's not a surprise. It's not a surprise
[1:14:58] that when you read Mark 16, you see that
[1:15:00] the people who were worried about the
[1:15:02] resurrection of Jesus Christ were women.
[1:15:05] Yes.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; It's not a surprise that the church of
[1:15:08] Christ is compared to a woman.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; It's not a surprise that she was also
[1:15:14] the first to be deceived.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; She wants to believe something.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; She wants to believe that the Messiah,
[1:15:25] even if he's still dead, I still have
[1:15:28] access to his body.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; She wants to believe something.
[1:15:33] But the men are called to be the people
[1:15:36] who will be the shepherds of their
[1:15:38] homes.
[1:15:41] So that means the man must stand on his
[1:15:44] post of duty.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; To protect her,
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; to make sure she doesn't go astray. To
[1:15:53] make sure she's walking in line with the
[1:15:55] message of the hour.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Now, the surprising thing is this.
[1:16:00] In many houses, the women are the ones
[1:16:03] who are taking the leadership.
[1:16:09] Sometimes for good reasons, sometimes
[1:16:11] for bad reasons.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; The man is so busy.
[1:16:17] He's so busy.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; He's so busy with work. He's so busy
[1:16:22] with projects.
[1:16:24] Now the sisters remember
[1:16:27] my firstborn is going to die if we don't
[1:16:29] put the blood on the doorpost.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; So she tries, she says, "I will go get
[1:16:37] this lamb." And God is looking at it and
[1:16:40] he says, "You're trying to do a good
[1:16:42] thing, but it is out of order."
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; So men, stand on your post of duty.
[1:16:52] Hallelujah.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; It is an irresponsible thing to have a
[1:16:58] child if you're not going to put the
[1:17:00] blood on the doorpost.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; God will hold you accountable.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; And the blood of Jesus Christ is not
[1:17:10] literal anymore. The blood of Jesus
[1:17:13] Christ is the revealed word.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Stay under the revealed word. Make sure
[1:17:21] your children are receiving the re
[1:17:24] revealed word. Dwell there. They shall
[1:17:27] live.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; There is a guarantee. There is an
[1:17:30] assurance.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; The angel of death will pass.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; It is not if.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; It's a question of when.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; He will pass.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; You don't want your children to be found
[1:17:42] outside.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; You don't want your children to be found
[1:17:45] in a house where there is no blood on
[1:17:47] the doorpost. You want them to be found
[1:17:50] in a place under the blood.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; To get the blood,
[1:17:59] you have to make some sacrifices.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; I'm here to remind you, you have to make
[1:18:06] some sacrifices.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; That means you may have to forsake that
[1:18:11] Wednesday night job
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; because you love your child.
[1:18:18] That means you'll have to refuse that
[1:18:19] Sunday morning shift
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; because you love your children.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; You can say, "Well, me, I'm good. I
[1:18:27] already know what I believe." Yes. They
[1:18:29] don't.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Everything that you're working for shall
[1:18:39] remain here.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; God on the day of judgment, you will
[1:18:43] never say, "You see, brother, you had
[1:18:44] one job, so I understand." No. He will
[1:18:48] ask, "What did you do of my word?"
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; So, we can go into idol talk. We can go
[1:18:55] into arguments.
[1:18:57] We show you one scripture, you show
[1:18:58] another one.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, a good debate does
[1:19:05] not bring conviction.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; It takes Christ manifested
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; to bring conviction.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:15] We can debate.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; But debates do not glorify God.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; We glorify God by submitting ourselves
[1:19:26] to the word that he has given us.
[1:19:29] Or we try to look for things in the
[1:19:31] message that don't align.
[1:19:34] Anytime you begin to look for mistakes
[1:19:36] in the plan of God, you think to know
[1:19:39] better than God.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; But brother boss, they're here. I can
[1:19:44] prove them. Sure, you can prove them. So
[1:19:48] what?
[1:19:50] After you've proved them, so what?
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Ask yourself that question.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; After you've proved that this quote is
[1:20:00] not right, what will happen?
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; What about the other quote that is
[1:20:06] right?
[1:20:13] We cannot take one thing and say because
[1:20:15] I found something that I don't agree
[1:20:17] with everything else is wrong.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; No. Let me remind you my brothers and
[1:20:23] sisters this message that we have
[1:20:26] received many people don't know what it
[1:20:28] is.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; This message that we have received many
[1:20:34] people do not know what it is. There are
[1:20:36] some people who think the message is
[1:20:38] William
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Brano
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; and so that when the minute they find a
[1:20:42] mistake in the life of a man they negate
[1:20:45] the message.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; The message is not William brother.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; God is bigger than a man. He cannot make
[1:20:54] a a man his message.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; But the man must believe the message to
[1:21:00] become one with the message to bring
[1:21:02] people to believe him so that not even
[1:21:03] cancer can stand in his way. Amen.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; So you say well
[1:21:11] there is a message in the message.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; I will tell you. How will you know what
[1:21:19] is the message then and what is not the
[1:21:21] message?
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; If you say there is a message in the
[1:21:27] message, then you will need someone to
[1:21:29] help you filter out what is the message
[1:21:31] in the message.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:21:34] You see the problem with that?
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; You will have to know more than the
[1:21:38] prophet.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Are we ready to read some quotes?
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Sorry, that's just how I preach. I
[1:21:50] preach as if I'm talking to one person,
[1:21:52] right?
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; So bear with me, right?
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:56] Uh so I want to read a few quotes here
[1:22:00] and then uh we'll circle back to my idea
[1:22:05] because we have to understand what has
[1:22:08] been committed to us what God has given
[1:22:11] us so we can understand how to protect
[1:22:13] it and how to cherish it.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; You know if someone doesn't understand
[1:22:19] their responsibility they will never
[1:22:21] know how they will be judged.
[1:22:24] It's the end of the year. Many of us are
[1:22:26] approaching year end evaluation
[1:22:28] performance reviews at work. Imagine
[1:22:31] you've spent all these years
[1:22:36] you've been working but you don't know
[1:22:37] what you're supposed to be doing.
[1:22:42] So the prophet
[1:22:44] God told him if you can get people to
[1:22:48] believe in you
[1:22:50] not even cancer will stand in your way.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Because in his days cancer was as high
[1:22:58] as they come in forms of sickness.
[1:23:01] Now today we give every sickness the
[1:23:04] name of cancer.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Some people are even dying of cancers
[1:23:08] that they don't have.
[1:23:12] But here's what brother Brham says in
[1:23:14] the sermon gifts and calling are without
[1:23:16] repentance from 1950.
[1:23:19] I think it says 030 0.
[1:23:23] Brother Brham says
[1:23:26] I don't know if you're projecting them
[1:23:27] but it's in paragraph 21
[1:23:30] says he told me
[1:23:33] if I get the people to believe me.
[1:23:37] Okay. And then brother Brham says that
[1:23:40] seems strange for me to say this. You
[1:23:43] believe me?
[1:23:47] Aren't you supposed to believe God?
[1:23:50] You must believe that.
[1:23:54] Is someone projecting them? Cuz I don't
[1:23:56] want after I leave here people say that
[1:23:58] brother came and he read some quotes
[1:23:59] that we cannot find. All right. So no, I
[1:24:02] don't want that. It's a 50-03000.
[1:24:06] And then it's in paragraph 21.
[1:24:10] You must believe that you must believe
[1:24:13] God and believe Christ. And then he
[1:24:16] says, you must believe the Holy Ghost.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 21.
[1:24:23] Okay. Then after believing all of them,
[1:24:27] God wants you to believe me.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. That one right there. Paragraph 21.
[1:24:33] Right there where you are. I see that.
[1:24:38] All right.
[1:24:43] If I can if I can get people to believe
[1:24:45] me. He says, "That seems strange for me
[1:24:48] to have to say this. You believe in me."
[1:24:50] Brother Brown is speaking. Aren't you
[1:24:53] supposed to believe in God? You must
[1:24:56] believe that. You must believe God and
[1:24:59] believe Christ and believe the Holy
[1:25:02] Ghost. Then let's read this part
[1:25:04] together. Then after believing all of
[1:25:07] them, God wants you to believe me.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; God wants you to believe his prophet.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:22] That means even if you think the prophet
[1:25:25] did something wrong, leave it up to God.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Don't give yourself a responsibility
[1:25:32] that God did not give you to correct a
[1:25:35] man that God sent.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Just accept it.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Go on the day of judgment and say, "God,
[1:25:44] I believed your servant. I believe the
[1:25:46] one you sent to us." and leave it at
[1:25:50] that.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Are we still together?
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Now you can believe a man
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; and still the gift won't work for you.
[1:26:05] The reason today people believe in God,
[1:26:07] it's still Jesus, right? So he's
[1:26:10] developing a thought in here to explain
[1:26:13] to us that we don't just stop us saying
[1:26:16] I believe the Bible
[1:26:20] this book we believe it he is not
[1:26:22] denying that but he is saying after you
[1:26:26] have believed this Bible you need to
[1:26:28] believe the voice of God in your day.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:36] You need to believe the voice of God in
[1:26:39] your day so that you can receive God's
[1:26:41] blessing for your day.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; If you go with me to the book of Mark,
[1:26:48] Mark chapter 10,
[1:26:55] it's the story of the young rich ruler.
[1:27:03] Jesus said to him, "Why do you verse 18,
[1:27:07] why do you call me good? No one is good
[1:27:11] but one that is God." So he said, "You
[1:27:15] know the commandments.
[1:27:17] Do not commit adultery. Do not murder.
[1:27:20] Do not steal. Do not bear false witness.
[1:27:24] Do not defraud. Honor your father and
[1:27:26] your mother. All of those things are
[1:27:30] good.
[1:27:32] It's the law of Moses.
[1:27:35] They are equivalent today of our Bible.
[1:27:39] Verse 20. And he answered and said to
[1:27:42] him, "Teacher,
[1:27:44] all these things I have kept from my
[1:27:47] youth."
[1:27:49] Then Jesus looking at him, Jesus loved
[1:27:52] him.
[1:27:55] There was a an attribute about this
[1:27:57] young man that Jesus loved. He obeyed
[1:28:00] what he knew.
[1:28:02] But Jesus said to him, "You lack one
[1:28:05] thing,
[1:28:07] not many things." Many of us are not
[1:28:09] missing heaven because of many things.
[1:28:11] We are missing heaven because of one
[1:28:13] thing.
[1:28:15] Go your way.
[1:28:18] Sell whatever you have.
[1:28:24] the law of Moses,
[1:28:26] you go sell that. I will explain that in
[1:28:29] a minute. Okay? And give it to the poor.
[1:28:35] The physical material, the things that
[1:28:38] you have, you love so much, go give them
[1:28:42] to the poor. As if those poor people
[1:28:44] don't need God. They also need God. And
[1:28:47] then he says, "You will have a treasure
[1:28:49] in heaven and
[1:28:52] come take up the cross and follow me."
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; So Christ did not come to abolish the
[1:29:01] law of Moses.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; He says, "I came to fulfill the law."
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; So there is no contradiction between who
[1:29:10] Christ is and what the law is.
[1:29:13] But the thing is this, the law was never
[1:29:16] meant to be doctrine.
[1:29:19] The law was only a shepherd, a guardian
[1:29:21] to point us to Christ.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't meant to be doctrine.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; When we begin to make thou must, thou
[1:29:29] must not the doctrine of the church, we
[1:29:31] kick people of God out of the church.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; I hope you can see that.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we begin to rule people with
[1:29:39] an iron fist,
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; we will send God's children out
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; because we will tell you if your skirt
[1:29:46] doesn't reach the floor, you're not a
[1:29:48] bride.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Did God give us a measurement?
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; So why are we putting rules on God's
[1:29:58] children that God did not put?
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; You read the Bible, it tells you, "Let
[1:30:04] the strong bear with the weak.
[1:30:07] You take the weak, you kick them out
[1:30:08] because they don't look like you.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Where is the bearing with one another
[1:30:13] partner?
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; That brother is still struggling with uh
[1:30:18] alcohol. You say, "We don't want you in
[1:30:20] our church."
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; The best place for a sinner to be is in
[1:30:24] the house of God.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; We come here for transformation.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; And you hope that someday the word will
[1:30:32] hit the person and they will say, "Wow,
[1:30:35] amazing. grace. I was blind today. I
[1:30:38] see.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; But we say no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[1:30:42] no, no. If it doesn't look like us, it
[1:30:45] doesn't talk like us. It doesn't listen
[1:30:46] like us. We are kicking it out.
[1:30:51] And Jesus Christ says, for this reason,
[1:30:53] I came in the world.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; I came to bear record of the truth.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; I came to bear record of the truth. That
[1:31:03] means I came so you can have a standard
[1:31:06] of what is truth.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Because he told us up until he came,
[1:31:11] every man had a right to their own
[1:31:12] opinion of who God was. For some people,
[1:31:15] God was Moses. For some people, God was
[1:31:18] Elijah. But he says, none of those was
[1:31:21] God. I am God.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; I came to bear a record of the truth. I
[1:31:26] am the way. I am the truth. And I am the
[1:31:30] life.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So in other words, from now on, if
[1:31:34] you want to know what God looks like,
[1:31:37] look at me.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; If you want to know how God acts, look
[1:31:41] at me. I am God. I gave the law. If a
[1:31:44] woman is caught in adultery, she shall
[1:31:46] be stoned to death. That is the law of
[1:31:48] Moses. They catch a woman in adultery.
[1:31:50] They bring him to the lawgiver. They
[1:31:53] say, "What does the law say?" He looks
[1:31:55] at them and he says, "Whoever is without
[1:31:58] a sin,
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; let him be the first one to cast a
[1:32:01] stone,
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; did the word break the word?
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Why are we trying to make the word break
[1:32:09] the word?" Then
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy on us.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; We must wake up and realize that God has
[1:32:18] called us to believe his word.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; God did not call us to kick his other
[1:32:22] children out. Our attitude in the house
[1:32:26] of God says a lot about us.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Let me give you a story. The prodigal
[1:32:33] son.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; The prodigal son one day he gets enough
[1:32:38] of his father's house.
[1:32:42] Now I will ask you a question. I want
[1:32:43] you to be sincere. Have you ever been a
[1:32:45] prodigal son at any point in your life?
[1:32:48] I'll say yes many times. All right. You
[1:32:51] just get fed up of the things in the
[1:32:53] house of your father. You say, "God,
[1:32:55] just fill me with the power of William
[1:32:57] Brham and then I'll go out there and
[1:32:58] live my life the way I want to live it.
[1:33:02] God, just fill me with the revelation of
[1:33:04] the word. I'll go out there and I'll do
[1:33:05] whatever I want to do."
[1:33:08] Don't think like that.
[1:33:10] William Brham had the revelation. He had
[1:33:13] the power, but he did not amuse himself
[1:33:15] any way he wanted.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; We are constrained by the love of God.
[1:33:22] Amen.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Just because I love God and I know the
[1:33:26] word of God does not mean I can do
[1:33:28] anything I want.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; May I remind you that God does not give
[1:33:34] any man authority without limit.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Husband, love your wives. Wives be
[1:33:42] submissive to your husband.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Husbands will sit there and say, "Now
[1:33:46] I'm a king. You must treat me like a
[1:33:48] king." Mhm.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; No sir. No sir. Watch out. That's right.
[1:33:53] Because God didn't say she will be
[1:33:55] submissive to you unto death. No sir.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; She said you love her as Christ loved
[1:34:01] his bride.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; So if there is anyone who must die for
[1:34:04] the other in that relationship, it's you
[1:34:06] the man.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Cuz Christ died for his bride. And at no
[1:34:11] point did Christ ask the bride to die
[1:34:12] for her. For him.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; No. He laid down his life so she can
[1:34:17] have life.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; So God doesn't give any man authority to
[1:34:21] become a dictator.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; He gives you enough authority to become
[1:34:28] a humble servant.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Recognizing that without this authority
[1:34:33] of Christ, I am nothing.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; I'm here for Christ and I serve Christ
[1:34:37] only. So the prodigal son said, "Father,
[1:34:40] give me my authority. Give me my
[1:34:41] inheritance. I'll go live my life
[1:34:43] however I want." Father says, "Sure, one
[1:34:48] day it will be yours. Prove your
[1:34:50] quality. Show that you are mature
[1:34:52] enough. You will have it. Go to the
[1:34:55] upper room and wait for it." Try in
[1:34:58] Jerusalem until you're filled with
[1:35:00] power. You say, "Lord, that's too much
[1:35:02] for me. I don't want that.
[1:35:06] I'll go live my life however I want it
[1:35:08] to be."
[1:35:09] So the father says, "I cannot bind you.
[1:35:12] I won't keep you a prisoner in my own
[1:35:14] house because I'm a god of love and I'm
[1:35:17] also a god who sets people free.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; I will set you free. The prodigal son
[1:35:22] goes out there with his wealth. But who
[1:35:25] does he live in the house? His older
[1:35:27] brother. And many of us rejoice and say
[1:35:30] at least the father had one son left in
[1:35:32] the house.
[1:35:36] If the prodigal son had never come back,
[1:35:40] we wouldn't have known that the father
[1:35:41] stayed with a sinner in the house.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; It's not until the son comes back that
[1:35:51] we hear him saying,
[1:35:54] "Why are you doing this for that
[1:35:55] unworthy son of yours?"
[1:35:59] Very good.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; We look at the sinner out there.
[1:36:05] We say, "God, why do you bless those
[1:36:08] sinners out there? You don't bless me."
[1:36:13] Now, the good thing is this. The
[1:36:16] prodigal son did not come to his older
[1:36:18] brother's house.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; He came back to the house of his father.
[1:36:22] Yes.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; So you go on your knees and you cry,
[1:36:25] "Our Father, who art in heaven," but you
[1:36:28] believe you're the only child.
[1:36:34] At what point do you stop and look at
[1:36:36] other children of God and say, "We need
[1:36:38] to go after the lost souls."
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; And the best way to go after the lost
[1:36:44] souls is to live a life that will be
[1:36:46] salty enough for them to draw them back
[1:36:49] to Christ.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:53] Amen.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, the older brother says, "No, no, no,
[1:36:57] no. I've been with you all my life here.
[1:37:00] Not even a goat have you given me to
[1:37:02] slaughter with my friends. But this one
[1:37:04] who went and he wasted his life. He
[1:37:07] comes back. Look at the fist you're
[1:37:09] throwing for him." So, you're just happy
[1:37:11] to be in the house of God,
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; but you live there with hatred.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; I still show up to service. The pastor
[1:37:17] can't tell me anything wrong.
[1:37:22] You're in church, you're dying with
[1:37:23] pride. The pastor doesn't mind. I just
[1:37:26] show up in church. I pay my tithe. Do
[1:37:28] you really think God died for your
[1:37:30] tithe?
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; God died for your soul.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; So Ezekiel comes and he tells us, "The
[1:37:39] soul that sins
[1:37:42] is the soul that shall die."
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:47] So if your soul is not yet born again,
[1:37:51] we can rest assured of one destination.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Death leads to hell.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Ecclesiastes tells us that the way in
[1:38:00] which a tree leans is the way it falls.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; That means death does not change your
[1:38:06] eternal destiny.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; It simply takes you there.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; That's right. your decision and your
[1:38:12] choices while you're still alive, they
[1:38:14] are the ones that determine your eternal
[1:38:16] destiny.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; So don't be the prodigal son. Don't just
[1:38:22] rejoice to show up in church. Don't just
[1:38:24] rejoice to say, "I am still in my
[1:38:26] father's house." But you live in your
[1:38:28] heart with every bad habit.
[1:38:32] That will not help you.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; That will not help you. So Jesus looked
[1:38:37] at his disciples and he says the first
[1:38:39] shall be last.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; But this young rich ruler where we were
[1:38:47] in Mark, Jesus tells him, "Go sell
[1:38:51] everything that you have
[1:38:54] and give it to the poor and then you
[1:38:58] take up your cross and follow me."
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Now what is Jesus asking him to follow?
[1:39:05] Jesus was the revealed word of their
[1:39:08] day.
[1:39:09] Jesus is telling him the law and
[1:39:12] everything that you have done was good
[1:39:14] for a time but that will not open the
[1:39:17] way to heaven. Now you have to believe
[1:39:20] the revealed word of your day which is
[1:39:23] Jesus Christ. Take up your cross and
[1:39:26] follow the revealed word of your day.
[1:39:30] Today we can say take up your cross and
[1:39:33] follow this message of the hour.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Okay. So it's not just oh they also
[1:39:40] preach the Bible. I can go there.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; That's not the revealed word of your
[1:39:46] day.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; The Catholic preach the Bible.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Pentecostals preach the Bible.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; The Baptists preach the Bible. We say
[1:39:56] thank you God for that. But here's the
[1:39:58] thing. The bride is more than that.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; The bride realizes that there is a
[1:40:06] portion of the word that God leaves for
[1:40:09] each generation.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; You understand that?
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; The Bible is complete.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Let me help someone see this. This is
[1:40:21] the will of God for every human being.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:26] This
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; is the will of God for every human
[1:40:30] being.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; But in this will of God,
[1:40:34] there is a will of God for every
[1:40:37] dispensation,
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; for every age. So whenever you look
[1:40:42] there,
[1:40:43] you have to know it's not just steps. We
[1:40:46] are climbing higher and higher and
[1:40:48] higher and higher. Times are changing,
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; seasons are changing,
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; but we know the master of it all.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; He is the master of times and seasons.
[1:40:57] And in every time, in every season, he
[1:41:00] reveals himself differently.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; I am God. I change not. We say amen. But
[1:41:05] my revelation
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; My revelation does not remain the same.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; A revelation changes.
[1:41:19] And as revelation changes, the bride is
[1:41:23] the group that identifies that which is
[1:41:26] revealed in their day.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; They identify with it. They believe it.
[1:41:31] They become it.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; So if you want to know whether you are
[1:41:37] the bride, it's not church attendance.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; The bride doesn't come to church.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Listen to this carefully. The bride
[1:41:48] doesn't go to church. The bride is the
[1:41:50] church.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; We're still together.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; I can stop here or we still have energy
[1:42:02] for a few
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; All right. Let us read a few quotes here
[1:42:10] in the United under one head. I believe
[1:42:12] it was actually the sermon that the
[1:42:14] brother was playing here this morning.
[1:42:17] Brother Brandham says in paragraph 75
[1:42:20] we notice uh that's 58-0326
[1:42:24] united under one head. Now we notice
[1:42:27] then God takes the heart he takes
[1:42:30] control
[1:42:32] right God takes control of your heart.
[1:42:37] So that's why God asks you to love him
[1:42:39] with your entire heart.
[1:42:43] Not just to love him with your lips.
[1:42:46] You come to church, you sing hallelujah,
[1:42:48] praise the Lord. Amen. But the heart is
[1:42:50] far from him. So he tells us in the
[1:42:52] Bible, in the Old Testament, these
[1:42:54] people approach me only with their lips,
[1:42:55] but their hearts are far from me.
[1:42:58] So the Bible says as a man thinks in his
[1:43:02] heart, so is he.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, not so he will
[1:43:07] become.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; So is he right now? What you think of
[1:43:12] the word of God in your heart is what
[1:43:14] you are.
[1:43:19] So God takes the heart. Paragraph 75. He
[1:43:23] takes control. God wants to be in
[1:43:26] control of your heart. Now when sin came
[1:43:29] in and upset your heart and the devil
[1:43:32] come in and it blocked it all off,
[1:43:37] what? The connection with God was
[1:43:39] severed because of sin.
[1:43:42] But then God sent his own son made in
[1:43:45] the likeness of sinful flesh to cleanse
[1:43:48] the heart so that he could come in.
[1:43:54] So God sent his own son to do what the
[1:43:58] blood of animals could not do.
[1:44:01] The blood of animals could not pave the
[1:44:03] way for God to come and dwell in your
[1:44:05] heart. Because the blood of animals
[1:44:08] could not take your sins away. It could
[1:44:11] only cover it. That is why in the Old
[1:44:14] Testament,
[1:44:17] if you read carefully, the requirement
[1:44:19] for a lamp was a one-year-old lamp.
[1:44:23] The age of the animal determined the
[1:44:26] longevity of the purification
[1:44:29] of the atonement. All right? It was one
[1:44:32] year old. So every year they had to go
[1:44:34] back. They had to go back. But Christ
[1:44:39] who is without age, eternal when he died
[1:44:44] and offered his blood in the holiest of
[1:44:46] holies, because it has no age, the
[1:44:48] question of sacrifice is ended.
[1:44:51] Amen. Amen.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Now you know.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:44:57] Christ is without age.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; When he died here on earth, when he was
[1:45:03] crucified at the cross of Calvary, there
[1:45:08] are three things that took place and I
[1:45:10] want you to remember them for the rest
[1:45:12] of your life. They are very important.
[1:45:15] On earth, the curtain of the temple was
[1:45:18] torn. Amen.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; All of these are written in the Bible.
[1:45:22] Okay. The curtain of the temple was
[1:45:25] torn.
[1:45:27] People can now see the holiest of
[1:45:29] holies. When they look in there, no more
[1:45:32] glory.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Why? The glory is right there.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; In hell, his soul went to hell.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; That's what Peter tells us. And brother
[1:45:47] Brandham says he went in there to take
[1:45:49] the keys,
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; that which was binding the children of
[1:45:54] God.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; That power, keys are power.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; That power that Satan thought he had
[1:46:00] over us when Christ died when we call
[1:46:04] upon the name of Jesus Christ, every
[1:46:08] demon in hell on that day
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; recognized that a greater power than us
[1:46:13] is here.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; They gave him the keys. Amen.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; And then the third thing that happened,
[1:46:24] he went to heaven,
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; to the innermost place in the very
[1:46:29] presence of God. He went there as a high
[1:46:32] priest,
[1:46:34] not with the blood of animals,
[1:46:37] brothers. He went there with his own
[1:46:39] blood.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; And that pleased God.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; There was no sin in that. Yes.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; From that day on, he says, "When you sin
[1:46:50] against me, I will not require your
[1:46:52] blood anymore.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; I will look at that of my son."
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; So, don't let Satan hold you captive by
[1:47:00] the sins you did yesterday.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Don't let Satan remind you of what you
[1:47:04] did 10 10,000 years ago.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, God saves your soul. He
[1:47:09] doesn't wipe your memory.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:14] God saves your soul. He doesn't wipe
[1:47:17] your memory. It's your own
[1:47:18] responsibility to tell your memory
[1:47:21] yesterday is gone.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Another day has come.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Do something new in my life.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Today is a new day.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Let God do something new.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; You know that also means something else.
[1:47:37] The Bible tells us the mercies of God
[1:47:39] are renewed every day. Amen.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; You can't outrun the mercies of God.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Just stay with God.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; So, brother Brham is trying to show us
[1:47:51] that God took control
[1:47:54] by those three events that happened.
[1:47:56] Every realm, every dimension, God went
[1:47:58] there and he conquered.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; So, what he tells his children is to
[1:48:02] believe on him.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; Believe on him. Accept the word of God.
[1:48:09] Believe the word of God.
[1:48:12] Don't let Satan hold you captive by what
[1:48:15] happened yesterday.
[1:48:17] The sins of yesterday are forgiven.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Your brothers and your sisters, they may
[1:48:24] not forget what you did yesterday.
[1:48:26] Because there are some human beings who
[1:48:28] don't go fishing.
[1:48:30] The only time they go fishing, it's in
[1:48:33] God's sea of forgetfulness.
[1:48:35] They go over there to start looking for
[1:48:37] what you did yesterday.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; But you remember last year you did this.
[1:48:42] God says, "I don't remember that.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Love God.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; Obey his word.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; Apply the blood on your soul.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Your sins are forgiven.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Men may condemn you. Men may remember
[1:48:59] what you did. But God will look at you
[1:49:01] and say, "That's my beloved son. I'm
[1:49:05] pleased in him. I'm pleased in my
[1:49:07] daughter. So let not the condemnation of
[1:49:10] men and their judgments be the reason
[1:49:12] why you backslide.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Are we still together?
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; I thought I didn't have enough to preach
[1:49:23] this morning.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; We'll read one more quote and then we'll
[1:49:28] stop there.
[1:49:32] in the sermon trying to do God a service
[1:49:35] without being his the will of God. So
[1:49:37] 650718
[1:49:42] 18 yeah trying to do God that one
[1:49:45] paragraph 177
[1:49:48] brother Brham says
[1:49:50] the word
[1:49:52] the evening message
[1:49:55] must carry evening results.
[1:49:59] The evening message must carry evening
[1:50:02] results.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Not first church age results.
[1:50:10] No, they had faith. Yes, we want faith.
[1:50:15] But God has added to that faith.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Right? Don't get stuck on faith and say,
[1:50:21] "I believe."
[1:50:23] No. By the authority of the word, we
[1:50:25] know that even Satan believes.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; Yes. So go beyond that.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; You know the Bible says all things are
[1:50:32] possible to them that believe,
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; right? But he never said in what you
[1:50:36] believe.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; In all all things are possible to them
[1:50:41] that believe. You can have faith in a
[1:50:44] wrong thing.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; You can have faith in the wrong thing.
[1:50:52] Faith is not what determines
[1:50:54] righteousness.
[1:50:56] God is the one who determines
[1:50:57] righteousness.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; Your faith can be in the wrong thing.
[1:51:02] But here's the surprising thing. It can
[1:51:05] still produce results.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; You want me to tell you something that
[1:51:15] will shock you?
[1:51:18] You can believe in the Father, Son, and
[1:51:19] Holy Ghost
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; and you'll still be saved because all
[1:51:24] you have to do is to believe on the Lord
[1:51:26] Jesus Christ for salvation.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; The names are not Jesus Christ.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; They are titles.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; You can believe on that and still be
[1:51:35] saved.
[1:51:37] That's salvation.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; That's not the baptism of the Holy
[1:51:40] Spirit. All right. Now, brother Brham
[1:51:44] goes on and he says, he goes even
[1:51:45] further in discerning of spirit.
[1:51:49] He says you can have the baptism of the
[1:51:51] Holy Spirit under that belief.
[1:51:56] Church is quiet, so we have to read it
[1:51:58] so you don't say, "I'm so
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Church is very quiet, so I have to read
[1:52:05] you the quote so you don't say, "Brother
[1:52:08] Boss, you brought a lie in church." So
[1:52:11] let's read it together.
[1:52:22] All right. In demonology
[1:52:29] in demonology. So that's 530609A.
[1:52:35] Uh that's the religious realm. You're in
[1:52:37] you're in the physical realm. All right.
[1:52:39] So let's begin from paragraph 45
[1:52:43] somewhere around there.
[1:52:46] See I told you I don't have a message to
[1:52:47] preach to you. I only take what the
[1:52:49] prophet gave and I give it to you.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; God is responsible for his word. I'm not
[1:52:53] responsible.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; If you haven't picked it up by now, I
[1:52:57] believe everything the prophet said.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; No exception. I don't try to make it
[1:53:01] work. All right. So now scroll down a
[1:53:05] little bit.
[1:53:06] Yes. I was right up here in Indiana at a
[1:53:09] certain group, certain place called
[1:53:11] Mishawaka. The first group of
[1:53:13] Pentecostal people I ever seen. They
[1:53:17] were called the Pentecostal Assemblies
[1:53:19] of Jesus Christ, I believe, or something
[1:53:22] like that. Wonderful bunch of people.
[1:53:25] Now they have organized together and
[1:53:29] called them United Pentecostal.
[1:53:32] They break up from the rest of them
[1:53:34] because of an issue of water baptism.
[1:53:38] That doesn't make them any hypocrite.
[1:53:41] So I hope first of all you can see the
[1:53:43] thought of the prophet. Don't ever call
[1:53:46] a brother a hypocrite because he
[1:53:47] believes something you don't agree with.
[1:53:49] Okay? Says there there is many a genuine
[1:53:55] real genuine Holy Ghostborn again
[1:53:57] Christians in their ranks. read the next
[1:54:01] part.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Okay. And then
[1:54:20] Am I the one who say that?
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:54:24] Why God give them the Holy Ghost who
[1:54:29] obeys him.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; You can have the right doctrine and
[1:54:36] disobey God.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; That is the reason brother Branam says
[1:54:42] doctrine does not save.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; I'll repeat it.
[1:54:49] Doctrine does not save.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; It's obedience
[1:54:56] to what you know that saves you. If we
[1:55:00] are talking of doctrine, Judas had a
[1:55:02] good one.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Judas,
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; he believed on Jesus Christ,
[1:55:11] but he did not obey Jesus Christ.
[1:55:14] Because when it came to fulfilling the
[1:55:16] righteousness of God, he chose money.
[1:55:21] Now if you just forget and them that
[1:55:24] wants to be one way, let them be. You go
[1:55:27] ahead and be brothers.
[1:55:30] Don't break fellowship over things of
[1:55:32] doctrine.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Don't break fellowship over the issue of
[1:55:41] doctrine.
[1:55:43] But we have over,200 sermons,
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; Did brother Brandham preach preach all
[1:55:48] those sermons in the in the churches
[1:55:50] that had his doctrine?
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; Why do message believers then accept the
[1:55:55] message but don't accept the conduct of
[1:55:57] the messenger?
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; And I want you to know I am not trying
[1:56:04] to emphasize or tell you go to the
[1:56:06] denominations.
[1:56:08] Far from that. Get out of there. come
[1:56:11] out from among them.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; But this is what I want you to know. If
[1:56:15] you believe you have the truth, you
[1:56:17] should have no problem going in the
[1:56:19] house of Simon.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; But if you're afraid to go in the house
[1:56:26] of Simon, it's because you're not sure
[1:56:28] of what you believe in.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; Jesus was sure of what he believed in. I
[1:56:33] Paul says, "I know in whom I have
[1:56:35] believed."
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; Be sure of the one you believe in. Amen.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; When you are sure of the one you believe
[1:56:41] in, you will have no problem going there
[1:56:44] even if you know he will not entertain
[1:56:46] you. But you're not going there for
[1:56:47] Simon. You're going there for that
[1:56:49] prostitute.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; So let us go back to the meat of our
[1:56:57] sermon.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; I promise you this time I'm finishing.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; So the evening message must carry
[1:57:04] evening results. Amen.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; The evening message must sow evening
[1:57:08] seeds, not morning seeds. Evening seeds.
[1:57:11] But the evening time message will show
[1:57:13] will show evening time light. It will
[1:57:17] show evening time results. The evening
[1:57:20] time message.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; So in the same sermon, he continues,
[1:57:24] we're still in trying to do God a
[1:57:26] service without being the will of God.
[1:57:27] He says, how will he take his bride? By
[1:57:30] the word. Not by a new cart. Not by some
[1:57:33] theologian's idea, but according to his
[1:57:35] word, he will identify her. Don't put
[1:57:39] one thing to eat or take one thing from
[1:57:41] it. Now, leave it the way it is. That's
[1:57:44] how we accept the word of God. So, as I
[1:57:47] finish, I want to tell you this.
[1:57:50] God has given us his word.
[1:57:53] When we accept the word and we show God
[1:57:55] that we believe, he comes and he seals
[1:57:57] it with a seal, the baptism of the Holy
[1:57:59] Spirit. Brothers and sisters, don't let
[1:58:02] anything make you fall short of the
[1:58:04] glory of God.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; Sometimes troubles come in your life.
[1:58:08] Remember something. Trouble comes from
[1:58:10] Satan. God is not a troublemaker.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; God will allow you to to go through
[1:58:15] trials. He's trying to prove your
[1:58:17] character. After those trials, there is
[1:58:19] a reward.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. Accept
[1:58:24] the trials. Don't look at the trials and
[1:58:26] say, "This is too hard for me." No,
[1:58:30] simply say, "Lord, you allowed for this
[1:58:33] to come because you know by the faith
[1:58:35] that you have put in me through your
[1:58:38] word, I will overcome."
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; Because no temptation will overtake you
[1:58:42] that exceeds your faith.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; So Jesus Christ by the authority of the
[1:58:47] word, he has told us resist the devil.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; And he will flee from you. Hallelujah.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; That's how you guard what has been
[1:58:55] entrusted to you
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; by the help of the Holy Ghost.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; So let us read this last scripture here
[1:59:00] as I finish. Lego. Go with me in the
[1:59:02] book of Timothy. 2 Timothy chapter 1
[1:59:06] verse 13 and 14.
[1:59:12] The Bible says hold fast the pattern of
[1:59:14] sound words which you have heard from
[1:59:17] me. The messenger of the age is
[1:59:19] speaking. That is Paul speaking to his
[1:59:22] age. I want you to just remember there
[1:59:25] it applies to us as well. 2 Timothy
[1:59:27] chapter 1 verse3. Hold first the pattern
[1:59:30] of sound words which you have heard from
[1:59:32] me in faith and love which are in Christ
[1:59:38] Jesus. That good thing which was
[1:59:41] committed to you keep by the Holy Spirit
[1:59:44] who dwells in us.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you want to overcome, receive
[1:59:49] the Holy Spirit. He will help you
[1:59:52] overcome.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; God bless you,
[1:59:56] [Applause]
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; brother Moses.
[2:00:14] Thank you. Beautiful.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful.
[2:00:21] Beautiful.
[2:00:24] I enjoy that. Beautiful.
[2:00:27] I warned you it will be soft but nice.
[2:00:32] Very well cooked.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; And we enjoy it. Let's give a hand to
[2:00:38] the Lord once again. Thank you, Lord,
[2:00:40] for that.
[2:00:42] Thank you, Lord. Thank you.
[2:00:46] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you,
[2:00:48] brother. God bless you, Rich Larry.
[2:00:51] There's so many things uh so many good
[2:00:53] nuggets and just some proper food. But
[2:00:58] may God help us just to to good and to
[2:01:01] keep what has been committed to us. We
[2:01:05] have the perfect word, the perfect
[2:01:09] interpretation
[2:01:12] with perfect vindication,
[2:01:14] [Music]
[2:01:16] perfect love
[2:01:18] may just help us to keep us to keep it
[2:01:20] and to value it the more and more as we
[2:01:24] see the day passing. Amen. Did you enjoy
[2:01:26] the word of God?
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Let's let's let's sing
[2:01:30] that song. Every promise in the book is
[2:01:33] mine. Every
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; every promise in the book is mine.
[2:01:44] Every chapter, every verse, every line.
[2:01:50] I am trusting in his love divine.
[2:01:55] Every promise in the book is mine.
[2:02:01] Every promise for the bride is mine.
[2:02:06] Every message, every goal, every line.
[2:02:11] I am trusting in his love divine.
[2:02:16] Every promise for the bride is mine.
[2:02:21] Oh mine, mine, mine.
[2:02:25] Jesus is mine. Oh mine. When I'm weary,
[2:02:30] my man,
[2:02:32] [Music]
[2:02:34] my mind. Jesus is mine. Jesus is mine
[2:02:40] all the time.
[2:02:43] And I love him better every
[2:02:51] day.
[2:02:54] Close by his side. I will.
[2:02:59] I love you better every day.
[2:03:04] Oh, that's enough to make me sing.
[2:03:10] That's enough to make me sing.
[2:03:14] My sins are all forgiven and I'm on my
[2:03:18] way to heaven.
[2:03:20] That's enough to make me
[2:03:24] Make me
[2:03:28] sing.
[2:03:29] Oh, give me all in my l keep me
[2:03:34] burning. Give me all in my l I
[2:03:39] pray. Give me all in my keep me burning.
[2:03:45] Oh give me burning till the break of
[2:03:49] day.
[2:03:50] [Music]
[2:03:51] Sing hosana.
[2:03:54] Sing hosana.
[2:03:56] Sing hosana to the king of kings. Sing
[2:04:03] hosana.
[2:04:04] Sing hosana.
[2:04:07] Sing hosana to the king. One more time.
[2:04:12] Sing hosana.
[2:04:15] Sing hosana.
[2:04:18] Sing hosana to the king of kings. Oh,
[2:04:23] sing hosana.
[2:04:26] Sing hosana.
[2:04:28] Sing sing hosana to the king.
[2:04:35] Amen. Do you know that song ageless one?
[2:04:38] So yeah, let let's see them. I like that
[2:04:42] thought. You know each lamb has one year
[2:04:45] but this one has no age no no no year.
[2:04:49] So when he come and he dies for you it's
[2:04:52] eternal salvation.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; You are not saved today and next year
[2:04:56] you have to come God save me one more
[2:04:58] time. No. If you are saved and filled
[2:05:00] with the Holy Ghost is until
[2:05:02] destination. If he has washed your sins
[2:05:05] they are put in the sea of forgetfulness
[2:05:07] not to remember them anymore.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; That's why it's a good report. Amen.
[2:05:12] What the doctor is saying is not the
[2:05:14] final report. What God says is the final
[2:05:16] report. Amen. Whatever you are going
[2:05:19] through, trial, whatever you are going
[2:05:21] through, God, you have the last word.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; Because you are the ageless one. You
[2:05:25] have the final word, Lord. And I want to
[2:05:28] love you. Not only love you, but I want
[2:05:30] to obey you. Oh, thank you, brother. I
[2:05:33] want to go to the next step. I want to
[2:05:35] obey you. I want to follow your word.
[2:05:38] Not only doctrines but I want the life
[2:05:40] of Jesus Christ.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; Oh ageless one
[2:05:46] faithful
[2:05:47] and so unchanging
[2:05:55] one. You're my rock
[2:05:59] of peace.
[2:06:02] Lord
[2:06:03] of host, I depend on you.
[2:06:10] I call out to you to you
[2:06:15] again and again.
[2:06:18] I call out to you.
[2:06:23] Again and again,
[2:06:25] [Music]
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; you are the rock. Oh, in times
[2:06:32] of trouble,
[2:06:35] you lift me up. Sister, you have to help
[2:06:38] me
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; for the
[2:06:44] all through the storm.
[2:06:47] Your love
[2:06:50] is
[2:06:52] the anchor.
[2:06:56] My hope is in you.
[2:07:01] Let's try to reduce a little bit. I
[2:07:02] think I'm struggling there.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; Faithful
[2:07:06] one, so unchanging,
[2:07:12] ageless
[2:07:14] one. You're my rock
[2:07:18] of peace,
[2:07:21] Lord
[2:07:22] of all. I depend on you. Let's stand
[2:07:27] together.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; I call to you
[2:07:34] again and again.
[2:07:38] I call to you.
[2:07:40] [Music]
[2:07:42] Again.
[2:07:44] [Applause]
[2:07:46] You are my
[2:07:49] in times
[2:07:51] of trouble.
[2:07:54] You lift me up
[2:07:58] when I
[2:08:00] fall down
[2:08:03] all through the storm.
[2:08:06] Your love
[2:08:09] is
[2:08:11] the anchor.
[2:08:15] My hope is in you. Oh Lord, you are my
[2:08:20] rock. One more time. You are my rock
[2:08:25] in times
[2:08:27] of trouble.
[2:08:30] You lift me up
[2:08:34] when I
[2:08:36] fall down
[2:08:39] all through the storm.
[2:08:42] Your love
[2:08:44] is
[2:08:46] the anchor.
[2:08:50] My hope is in you alone.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; Let just all of us go to the Lord in
[2:08:59] prayer. The music is just playing
[2:09:01] softly.
[2:09:03] Tell him Lord I want to keep by your
[2:09:06] grace what you have committed unto me.
[2:09:09] You have given me Lord the message of
[2:09:12] the hour. You have given me the Holy
[2:09:15] Ghost. You have given me father message
[2:09:18] that's changing my heart.
[2:09:20] that has to change my heart to be a
[2:09:23] heart like yours. Father Lord, help me
[2:09:26] by your grace to be more obedient to
[2:09:29] you, to love you more and to express my
[2:09:32] love towards you by living what you have
[2:09:35] given me to do. Just let the good Lord
[2:09:39] in prayer each individual.
[2:09:41] [Music]
[2:09:48] Father, we thank you Lord Jesus Christ
[2:09:51] this morning as the word came
[2:09:55] spoke to our heart. Father Lord
[2:09:58] we thank you father for the servant that
[2:10:00] we have used.
[2:10:02] Thank you father for the vessel that you
[2:10:04] have sanctified and put aside but you
[2:10:07] also put him into service to speak to
[2:10:10] our heart this morning. Father Lord we
[2:10:13] came Lord expecting we are returning our
[2:10:17] homes changed. We are returning the home
[2:10:20] father filled as we have been feisting
[2:10:23] upon the word of truth. Father, thank
[2:10:26] you for the warning. But sometimes,
[2:10:28] Lord, we think that we might be the
[2:10:30] filtering of your word and to know like
[2:10:34] this prophet says this, but I believe
[2:10:36] this part and I leave the other part.
[2:10:38] But, Father Lord, we desire to God what
[2:10:41] you have given us to keep it the way it
[2:10:43] has been given to us without
[2:10:45] compromising it. Father Lord without
[2:10:47] hybridating it father if we hybrid what
[2:10:51] we have we receive it won't be pure
[2:10:54] anymore and won't produce the result
[2:10:56] anymore as the court said father Lord
[2:10:59] the evening message comes to produce the
[2:11:01] evening result the word that we have
[2:11:04] received father shall meet the challenge
[2:11:06] of the age but as long as we keep it
[2:11:08] pure as long as we accept it Lord you
[2:11:11] have given us a recommendation to accept
[2:11:14] the word to receive the book and to eat
[2:11:17] it up, Father. Not to take a part of it,
[2:11:19] but to eat it up the all of it in our
[2:11:21] heart and to receive it, Father, at what
[2:11:24] we desire to do, Lord, to accept your
[2:11:26] word, to accept you, to take you at your
[2:11:28] word, to believe it. Lord, help the men
[2:11:31] of home, the heads of home, Lord, to
[2:11:33] take the position as we have been Lord
[2:11:36] recommended this morning. Help us to
[2:11:39] apply the token with love to apply the
[2:11:42] token father Lord with commitment like
[2:11:45] to show our life by example Lord that
[2:11:48] our life might match what the word of
[2:11:49] God says align yourself with you Lord we
[2:11:53] realize that we cannot do it on our own
[2:11:55] it's only by your grace father give us
[2:11:58] Lord that give us more of the Holy
[2:12:00] Spirit Lord that we can come to the
[2:12:03] place where it's not you not us living
[2:12:05] but it's you living your own life
[2:12:07] through
[2:12:08] But Lord, we desire our heart to be
[2:12:10] willing. What we desire is to surrender
[2:12:12] ourself to you. Lord, this evening, this
[2:12:15] morning, we open our heart to say, Lord,
[2:12:18] we surrender all to you. We surrender
[2:12:20] all everything to you for you to have
[2:12:22] the preeminence as the secret is being
[2:12:25] unfolded. The three-fold secret of God,
[2:12:28] purpose of God, Lord, you have been
[2:12:30] manifested in Christ. As has been
[2:12:33] preached this morning, Christ was Lord,
[2:12:35] the transition from the Lord to the
[2:12:37] grace. But now, Father Lord, the bride
[2:12:40] is the manifestation of Christ. Lord,
[2:12:43] you want to have the full preeminence in
[2:12:45] the bride. Lord, we surrender ourself to
[2:12:47] you, Lord. So that you can have the
[2:12:50] primance in our heart. Lord, we
[2:12:52] surrender our whole to you, Lord. So
[2:12:54] that you reign and rule in our heart, in
[2:12:56] our house, Lord, the husband, the wives,
[2:12:59] the children, Lord, that you reign and
[2:13:02] lord. Father, thank you Lord for the
[2:13:04] word. Thank you for the message of the
[2:13:06] hour. Thank you for your servant. Thank
[2:13:08] father for the revelation you have
[2:13:11] unfolded once again this morning. You
[2:13:13] don't change but the revelation of God
[2:13:16] increases Lord. Thought the revelation
[2:13:19] of the word that we have today is
[2:13:20] greater than revelation in time of
[2:13:22] Luther is greater than revelation in
[2:13:25] time of Wesley greater the revelation in
[2:13:27] time of the Pentecostal. Father we have
[2:13:30] received a greater revelation of the
[2:13:32] same God who does not change. Father
[2:13:34] help us to get into that revelation that
[2:13:37] becomes a reality to us. Lord we love
[2:13:39] you. We appreciate you. Thank you for
[2:13:42] the brother. Thank you for the sister
[2:13:43] that came this morning. the leak of fire
[2:13:45] Lord that we could Lord benefit from one
[2:13:48] another Lord encourage one another we
[2:13:50] love you and appreciate you Lord it's
[2:13:52] good to be in your house to be good good
[2:13:55] to be in the body of Christ father we
[2:13:57] came sometimes weak but when we see our
[2:14:00] sister praising the Lord we see our
[2:14:02] brother praising the Lord oh God we feel
[2:14:05] encouraged we see Christ working as you
[2:14:08] have reminded us this morning Lord the
[2:14:11] bride is not only Lord the coming to
[2:14:13] church but the bride is the church. We
[2:14:16] are the church. Father, when we see one
[2:14:18] another, oh God, we see you working
[2:14:21] through my brother, do you working to my
[2:14:22] sister, oh God, we feel encouraged.

[2:14:58] pray. Uh let's pray for our
[2:15:01] father-in-law. Amen. Father-in-law that
[2:15:03] he came to visit. We need also to pray
[2:15:05] for him and for full recovery. Is it
[2:15:08] okay if you give me one moment just to
[2:15:10] pray for that knee? just comes to my
[2:15:12] mind for a moment just to unite our
[2:15:14] faith and for that let's bow our heads
[2:15:15] once again for the Lord Jesus Christ the
[2:15:18] prophet says we can never pray enough
[2:15:21] Lord we just comes to my mind right now
[2:15:23] once again Lord for the need Lord for
[2:15:26] the father-in-law Lord that I had a
[2:15:29] health issue father Lord but Lord as we
[2:15:32] heard this morning you are the one who
[2:15:34] has the last word you are the one who
[2:15:37] have the final say father Lord and your
[2:15:40] report is always good. By your stripes,
[2:15:42] we are already healed, Lord. So Lord, we
[2:15:45] send the word to our father where he is
[2:15:48] Lord in Calgary or on the area of
[2:15:50] Calgary. May you touch him, Father. May
[2:15:53] you restore him, Lord Jesus Christ. May
[2:15:56] the strength, Lord, come back and and
[2:15:58] increase greater and greater and
[2:16:00] greater, Lord. Father, we commit him to
[2:16:02] you, Lord. Father, maybe you have you
[2:16:05] have you have you have allowed this to
[2:16:07] happen here so that maybe maybe maybe so
[2:16:10] that someone today could be blessed
[2:16:13] through the ministry. But Father, now as
[2:16:15] we have been blessed, would you please
[2:16:17] Father restore him completely? Father,
[2:16:20] Lord Jesus Christ, you are in control of
[2:16:23] every situation. God, you are never
[2:16:26] late. As we heard in the song say, you
[2:16:28] are never late. Father, we just want to
[2:16:30] trust you. Have that right attitude. Say
[2:16:33] father let father let your name be
[2:16:35] praised and glorified even in the midst
[2:16:37] of this trial. Lord you will get the
[2:16:39] glory and the honor. Father we thank you
[2:16:42] and appreciate you. Father we pray that
[2:16:44] you visit the family and restore them in
[2:16:46] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[2:16:52] Amen. Amen.

[2:17:04] if I been think to sing then sings my
[2:17:06] soul. How great the heart has been in my
[2:17:08] heart and then he sang it this morning
[2:17:10] and I was like oh we're in the same

[2:21:39] you, brother. Thank you, brother. I
[2:21:41] enjoyed it." It's like a sister when she

[2:21:48] human part there. So, please tell him we
