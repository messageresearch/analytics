[3:37] Just change. What a day that will be.
[3:54] There is coming
[3:58] a day
[3:59] when no heartaches
[4:02] shall come.
[4:05] No more clouds
[4:07] in the sky.
[4:10] No more tears to dim the eye.
[4:15] All is peace forever more
[4:20] on that happy
[4:22] golden shore.
[4:25] What a day,
[4:27] glorious day
[4:29] that will be.
[4:34] What a day
[4:37] that will be
[4:39] when my Jesus
[4:42] I shall see.
[4:44] When I look upon his face, the one who
[4:50] saved me by his grace.
[4:55] And he leads me by the hand
[5:00] and leads me to the promised land.
[5:05] What a day,
[5:07] glorious day
[5:10] that will be.
[5:15] There'll be no
[5:17] sorrow there.
[5:20] No more burdens
[5:23] to bear.
[5:25] No more sickness,
[5:28] no pain,
[5:30] no more parting
[5:32] over there.
[5:35] And forever
[5:37] I will be

[6:16] And he takes me by the hand
[6:20] and leads me through the promised land.
[6:26] What a day,
[6:28] glorious day
[6:31] that will be.
[6:42] Sometimes when you're when you're a kid
[6:43] and you get in trouble or you're you're
[6:47] out somewhere and I was just maybe I've
[6:49] told this story, but when I was a kid,
[6:50] my brother and I were out in a field and
[6:53] we're just on a farm and we were we're
[6:56] playing and I think we're flying kites
[6:57] and we just got hopelessly stuck out
[7:00] there and
[7:03] it's something different when someone
[7:05] else comes and rescues you, just ends
[7:08] all the trouble, ends all the all the
[7:11] being stuck and all the all the bad
[7:13] moods and just someone comes there and
[7:14] picks you up and takes you away. And
[7:17] it's kind of where we're at now. What a
[7:20] day that'll be when our father comes and
[7:23] takes us home, brings us out of the me
[7:26] and takes us out of the the mud. And
[7:30] we won't have reason to have a bad
[7:32] attitude.
[7:35] Maybe she'll stand.
[7:47] Stay right under the
[8:01] I'm going to
[8:07] I'm stay
[8:13] right under the blood.
[8:17] Wo! The world can do me no harm.
[8:23] No harm. No harm. No harm.

[8:32] I'm going to stay right under the blood.
[8:38] So this world can do me no harm.

[8:48] I'm going to treat my neighbors.
[8:52] I'm going to treat my neighbors rock
[8:58] so this world can do me no harm.
[9:03] No harm. No harm. No harm.
[9:08] No harm. No harm. No harm.
[9:12] I'm going to stay right under the blood
[9:17] so this world can do me no harm.
[9:22] I'm going to stay right under the blood.
[9:27] I'm going to stay right under the blood.
[9:32] I'm going to stay right under the blood
[9:37] so this world can do me no harm, no
[9:41] harm. No harm, no harm, no harm.
[9:47] No harm, no harm, no harm.
[9:51] I'm going to stay right under the blood
[9:56] so this world can do me no harm.
[10:05] While we're singing, we'll just go to
[10:07] the Lord prayer. There's a prayer
[10:09] request for sister Sharifa. She's not
[10:11] feeling well. And then also prayer for

[10:24] the Lord for a natural delivery for the
[10:27] baby

[12:51] My boat of life sails on the troubled.
[12:56] It sees
[12:58] whenever there's a wind in my sand.

[13:54] highs.
[13:55] Among the peaks my soul can be found.

[14:07] the heights.
[14:09] May bring me low. It'll never bring me
[14:13] down.

[16:14] Love lifted me.
[16:29] I was sinking deep in sin, far from the
[16:35] peaceful shore.
[16:39] very deeply stained within,
[16:44] sinking to rise no more.
[16:50] But the master of the sea
[16:55] heard my despairing
[16:57] cry
[17:00] from the waters lifted me from save.

[19:35] 288. Thank God I'm free.
[19:52] Thank God I am free. Free. Free from
[19:57] this world of sin.
[20:02] Been washed in the blood of Jesus. Been
[20:07] born again.
[20:11] Hallelujah. I'm saved. Saved. Saved by
[20:16] his wonderful grace.
[20:21] I'm so glad that I found out he could
[20:24] bring me out and show me the way.
[20:31] For a long time I've traveled
[20:35] down a long lonely road.
[20:41] My heart was so heavy in sin. And I sang
[20:45] low
[20:48] that I heard about Jesus. Heard about
[20:52] Jesus. Oh, what a wonderful hour.
[20:59] I'm so glad that I found out he could
[21:02] bring me out through his saving power.
[21:07] Thank God I'm free. Thank God I am free.
[21:11] I am free. free from this world of sin.
[21:17] This world of sin. Been washed in the
[21:20] blood of Jesus. Been born again.
[21:28] Hallelujah. I'm saved. Saved. Saved by
[21:33] his wonderful grace.
[21:38] So glad that I found out he could bring
[21:42] me out. Show me the way. Yes, he show me
[21:46] the way. Like
[21:49] prison
[21:57] like a blind man that God gave back his
[22:02] son.
[22:05] Like a poor wretched beggar
[22:10] that's found fortune and faith.
[22:13] I am so glad. I'm so glad I found out he
[22:18] could bring me out through his holy
[22:22] name.

[23:06] Glory, glory, glory to his name. Glory,
[23:10] glory to his name. We are saved by God's
[23:13] grace. Sovereign grace. No one cannot
[23:17] bargain about God's grace. God himself
[23:19] decides to save you and no one can take
[23:21] you out from God's economy. You are part
[23:24] of God's economy and God can never lose
[23:27] you. Thank God for his grace. Amen.
[23:30] Amen. We can never thank God enough for
[23:33] his grace. Every day I'm still amazed
[23:36] that he loves me. Say, "Oh, you know,
[23:39] there's one preacher said that Spurgeon
[23:41] said, you know, when I look at myself, I
[23:44] don't see how I can be saved, how I can
[23:46] make it when I look at myself." But when
[23:49] I look at God's love and grace, I don't
[23:52] see how I can miss it. Because he
[23:54] already when he loves you, he loves you
[23:56] forever. There's no way he can lose you.
[23:59] Thank God for his grace. Amen.
[24:03] God bless you richly this this evening.
[24:05] It's good to be in the house of the
[24:06] Lord. Amen. Thank God for his grace in
[24:09] our life and God knows every situation
[24:12] and we just want to thank him for
[24:14] everything that he's doing. Amen. Um
[24:17] thank God for the good report for
[24:18] brother Peter and his family. Be
[24:21] worried. It's actually I I call it a
[24:23] miracle because the the doctors it's
[24:26] contradicted what the doctors expected
[24:28] to be. And the baby came out normal with
[24:31] normal delivery. So we thank God for his
[24:34] grace for God answers to prayers. Amen.
[24:37] And brother Peter himself is not here
[24:39] but thank God that sister Wendy stepped
[24:42] in and it's a blessing. God bless you
[24:44] richly. Sister Wendy I I believe there
[24:47] was some communication collaboration
[24:49] between them and will continue to to be
[24:52] that way and I thank God for that that
[24:55] she's stepping in. She when she sees the
[24:57] need. God bless her richly. She has
[25:00] served all her life for giving her life
[25:03] for others. May God bless her, bless her
[25:06] children, our grandchildren
[25:08] and even our great great the Lord
[25:10] Terries.
[25:12] Amen. God bless you. We appreciate her a
[25:14] lot and may God bless you and continue
[25:16] strengthen her. Amen.
[25:19] There is just one request here and just
[25:22] want to give the liberty to the saints.
[25:24] So I would like to give a request to
[25:27] give a testimony. So brother can just
[25:30] step up and give the testimony for what
[25:33] God has done in my life.
[25:35] Brother Matendo
[25:37] don't have a microphone
[25:40] can just have a seat for a moment as
[25:41] he's giving his testimony.
[25:46] God bless you saints. Amen. I am happy
[25:51] to stand in the midst of uh the bride of
[25:55] Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. For what God
[25:58] is doing for me and for my family.

[32:47] going to be the family in prayer. God
[32:48] knows everything. Um especially for the
[32:52] sister as well. Um just lost the mother
[32:56] lost a baby must be very hard as a
[32:59] daughter. It's hard and um but
[33:04] all the glory to God. Amen. He knows the
[33:06] right time and just thank him. I send
[33:09] the testimony. I said last time I sent a
[33:11] testimony to her and she she she just
[33:15] acknowledged and yesterday actually I
[33:17] talked with her quite longer than I
[33:20] would have expected. She could have
[33:21] answered the phone knowing that um
[33:25] breath was was it was difficult for her
[33:28] to breathe but she she kind of talked
[33:31] nice and appreciated testimony that I
[33:34] sent to her. It was a marvelous
[33:36] testimony what she wrote. It was a great
[33:39] testimony. So I believe that she always
[33:43] been positive that God will be merciful
[33:45] to her and the family as well. Just keep
[33:49] the rest of the family in prayer. Amen.
[33:53] Amen.
[33:56] And my sister Sharif is not feeling
[33:58] well. Just keep her in prayer as well.
[34:00] She was thinking that she Sorry.
[34:04] Absolutely. Absolutely.
[34:08] I think your voice is clear enough you
[34:09] can hear
[34:17] and um he finished preaching on the way
[34:19] home. We had that that accident and we
[34:22] rode up the car.
[34:24] Um
[34:27] I just figured maybe the enemy wasn't
[34:29] too happy with the service and that was
[34:31] his way of getting back at us. But um
[34:35] prior to that, the first time he
[34:37] preached also, it wasn't long before um
[34:40] the kids actually had an accident and
[34:43] rode off a vehicle as well. And theirs
[34:46] was a head-on. Um they were not wrong,
[34:49] but um as a result, the kids have they
[34:54] suffered concussions and going to the
[34:56] hospital, they didn't look after them.
[34:59] They just recommended Tyl.
[35:02] So for um the children that were in the
[35:04] car, it wasn't just the concussion
[35:06] pains, but the headaches, the back pains
[35:09] um
[35:11] affecting them, you know, with their
[35:13] school and the things that they they did
[35:15] on a regular basis. And even Gabriel,
[35:20] which is the last last boy, but he's
[35:22] just um he was involved in a real
[35:25] traumatic accident back in Ontario that
[35:28] lethargic and somehow God brought him
[35:31] back. But now he's suffering with we
[35:34] don't know what it is. The doctors can't
[35:35] tell what it is where he just gets like
[35:38] burning in different parts of his body.
[35:41] Um he would just break out in
[35:44] red
[35:46] like hives, bruises, rashes and we we've
[35:51] not been able to put a hand on it. You
[35:53] know, the doctor recommended that maybe
[35:56] his vitamin D was deficient and he got a
[35:58] lot of vitamin D shots, vitamin B12. Um,
[36:03] but it didn't make things better. It
[36:05] made worse. It affected his sleep now.
[36:08] So, he doesn't sleep very much in the
[36:10] night and he's tired just any hour of
[36:14] the day and it's affecting his studies,
[36:16] his everything.
[36:18] And it's very difficult with brother
[36:20] Victor to sort of age because sometimes
[36:26] it feels like I'm on survival mode but
[36:29] I'm just trusting the Lord and I just I
[36:32] just pray that everybody can have faith
[36:35] to mine
[36:36] so that I could see victory because God
[36:40] never told us that we would lose the
[36:42] battle all the time. He said, "You know,
[36:43] you may lose a battle now and then, but
[36:46] the war is won." And you know, just like
[36:49] Sister Kathy was saying a while ago, I
[36:51] keep telling myself like John and I, um,
[36:54] it's over. Correct. It's over. And you
[36:57] know, sometimes you testify to yourself,
[36:59] it's over. And you see the symptoms, it
[37:02] just exacerbates. But sometimes I just
[37:06] feel like, you know, I need somebody
[37:08] else's liqufier with mine. So it becomes
[37:11] a bonfire. Correct. Correct. Correct.
[37:14] That's all I That's my request. Correct.
[37:18] Thank you, Sister De. Thank you for
[37:20] putting that request. We committed to
[37:23] the Lord and as you said, we we Lord
[37:27] look at the sentone just we're going to
[37:29] join our faith with yours and claim the
[37:31] blood of Jesus Christ and what he has
[37:35] already done. The prophet says it's a
[37:37] finished work, man. Just need our faith
[37:39] to increase. So we join our faith with
[37:41] yours and put it that in a request
[37:45] prayer request and
[37:49] God likes to hear our prayers but he
[37:52] also likes to answer our prayers. So we
[37:55] thank God for that. Amen.
[38:00] Amen.
[38:03] Are you happy to be in the house of the
[38:04] Lord this evening? Invite you to go to
[38:07] the word of God. First kings.
[38:10] Just a few few minutes.
[38:31] First Kings chapter 7 17.
[38:46] First Kings comes after 2 Samuel 1 Kings
[38:49] chapter 17
[38:51] verse 7.
[38:55] Quite a familiar scripture.
[39:00] And it came to pass after a while that
[39:02] the brook dried up because there had
[39:05] been no rain in the land. And the word
[39:08] of the Lord came the the word of the
[39:10] Lord came unto him saying, "Arise, get
[39:14] thee to Zarath Zarifath which belongth
[39:18] to Zidon, and dwell there. Behold, I
[39:21] have commanded the widow woman there to
[39:24] sustain thee."
[39:26] And he arose and went to Zarifath. And
[39:30] when he came to the gate of the city,
[39:32] behold, the widow woman was there
[39:34] gathering of sticks.
[39:36] And he called to her and said, "Fetch
[39:38] me, I pray thee, a little water in the
[39:40] vessel that I may drink. And as she was
[39:44] going to fetch it, he called her and
[39:46] said, "Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel
[39:50] of bread in thine hand." And she said,
[39:53] "As the Lord thy God liveth, I have not
[39:56] a cake, but a handful of meal in a
[39:59] barrel and a little oil in the cruise.
[40:02] And behold, I am gathering two sticks."
[40:05] Remember, notice he says, "Two sticks
[40:08] that I may go in and dress it for me and
[40:11] my son that you may eat it and die." And
[40:15] Elijah said unto her, "Fear not. Go and
[40:19] do as thou hast said, and make me
[40:21] therefore a little cake first, and bring
[40:24] it unto me, and after and after for
[40:27] thee, and for thy son. For thou say the
[40:30] Lord God of Israel, the barrel of meal
[40:33] shall not waste, neither shall the
[40:35] cruise of oil fail until the day that
[40:38] the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth.
[40:41] Amen. And she went and did according to
[40:44] the saying of Elijah. And she and he and
[40:48] her house did eat many days. And the
[40:51] barrel of meal wasted not, neither did
[40:54] the cruise of oil fail according to the
[40:57] word of the Lord which is spark by
[40:59] Elijah the prophet. Amen. Let's just bow
[41:02] our head. Amen. Father, we thank you for
[41:04] your grace, your mercy, Lord, to be
[41:06] gathered in the house of the Lord Jesus
[41:09] Christ with the saints of like precious
[41:12] faith. Father, Lord, each one bringing
[41:15] the leak of fire, Lord, as one body.
[41:18] Father, we thank you for the word that
[41:20] has been open and now we can read the
[41:23] book. can read the Bible not as a closed
[41:26] book but as a open book father where we
[41:29] can see that not only a book of history
[41:32] but a book of reality the same God that
[41:35] was with Elijah is the same God who's
[41:37] with us is not the God of history only
[41:39] but the God of the present tense you are
[41:42] the great I am father make the word of
[41:44] God real to us this evening as we come
[41:47] this prayer meeting father to talk to
[41:49] you father may you stir our heart father
[41:51] with one word from you that will help us
[41:54] Lord to grasp your thoughts to gr your
[41:56] word and father to go and claim what we
[42:00] have need of according to your word.
[42:02] Father we surrender oursel to you. Bless
[42:04] your people. Bless each and every one of
[42:06] us this evening as we commit oursel to
[42:08] you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray.
[42:11] Amen. Amen.
[42:13] Can I have your seat?
[42:19] I would like to talk a little bit for a
[42:21] moment here. Just give me a 15 minute
[42:23] maybe or so just talk a little bit on
[42:25] the thought here. I would like to see
[42:27] just speak on her moving from from hope
[42:30] to faith. Moving from hope to faith.
[42:33] Hope is a very good thing. You know the
[42:35] Bible says Paul said that three things
[42:39] that I have to abide three things that
[42:41] have to remain. Charity, faith, hope,
[42:45] hope, faith and charity. Those three
[42:47] remainings those three things are very
[42:49] important. very very important as a
[42:51] Christian should have them. And it's
[42:53] good to have hope. It's good to it's
[42:56] good to hope. It's hope to have positive
[42:58] thinking, positive expectations. It's
[43:01] good for a Christian to have that
[43:02] positive expectation. It's very hard to
[43:05] leave around people are always negative.
[43:07] People are always looking at the wrong
[43:09] side. You know, all the the weather, you
[43:12] can look at the weather and just point
[43:14] at at the time it's going to rain. But
[43:16] not all day is going to rain. It might
[43:18] rain just for one hour. Don't point Ol
[43:20] that one hour it's going to rain the
[43:22] other day the other time is is is sunny.
[43:24] Amen. God wants us to be positive to be
[43:28] positive not to be negative. So to have
[43:30] some hope and to look for the hope and
[43:33] say oh I I I have hope. I believe I oh I
[43:35] hope it will be I'm I'm I'm expecting
[43:38] that. I I believe it's going to be that
[43:40] and and it's good to have that. And the
[43:43] Bible says and says in 1 Corinthians 9
[43:46] and it says just with the story say for
[43:48] our sakes no doubt there is written that
[43:51] he that pl should plow in hope. You
[43:54] don't see a farmer who who's planting
[43:57] and then says and he's thinking you know
[43:59] this this this year is going to be a you
[44:01] know very bad year as he's planting say
[44:04] this is year is going to be a very bad
[44:06] year. Nothing happened but just already
[44:08] looking at the negative side. Oh, a a
[44:10] farmer when he's planting is hoping that
[44:12] you will have good result. He's hoping
[44:15] that the the what he's putting is going
[44:16] to have a good harvest. He has he has a
[44:19] hope and what we are working whatever we
[44:21] are doing we we have hope. We we trust
[44:23] that we have hope and things will turn
[44:25] out right. Amen. We should have that
[44:27] expectation should have that
[44:29] expectations. But I want to say as well
[44:32] we need to move sometimes from hope to
[44:35] faith. Amen. We need to move from hope
[44:38] to faith and have that reality. And I
[44:41] was just thinking about it. Oh Lord,
[44:43] help me sometimes to move from hope to
[44:46] faith. Sometimes I can be thinking that
[44:49] I have faith, but I just actually only
[44:51] have hope. I'm just hoping that things
[44:54] will turn out right. But that's not
[44:56] really what the message has called us to
[44:58] be. That's not what the Bible has called
[45:01] us to be. That's not what a real
[45:02] Christian has to be. just hoping that
[45:05] things will turn all right or you know I
[45:08] hope I hope that I can make it. No, I
[45:12] believe I will make it. I'm sure I'm
[45:14] going. I'm certain it's going to be
[45:17] fine. I'm positive it's going to be
[45:19] fine. How do you know? Because the Bible
[45:22] says so. Amen. Amen. Don't be ashamed if
[45:26] you turn out here differently. God is in
[45:28] control of every situation. But as a
[45:31] believer, you are expecting it to be the
[45:34] way the Bible says that's going to be.
[45:36] Amen. Because God, as the s testify, God
[45:39] cannot fail his own word. He will
[45:41] bankrupt the whole heaven to you know in
[45:43] in order
[45:45] in order to fail his own word. He cannot
[45:47] never fail his own word. His own word
[45:50] has to come to realize a Christian lives
[45:53] by faith. A Christian lives by faith.
[45:57] Means you cannot be a Christian unless
[45:59] you believe everything that the word of
[46:02] God says. A Christian does not believe
[46:05] by how we think things might turn out.
[46:07] No, a Christian walk knowing that God
[46:11] will back up his own word. He doesn't
[46:14] know how it's going to happen and he
[46:16] doesn't try to figure out things but he
[46:18] believes and keeps working forward.
[46:20] Amen.
[46:23] Faith is a revelation. Faith is is a is
[46:26] a substance. It's a substance of things
[46:29] hoped for. So you hope for certain
[46:32] things but it go to another level where
[46:34] you know I have now a substance. I have
[46:37] a reality is that is is it tangible as
[46:40] with a hand with our mind? No. But it's
[46:43] tangible with a super sense that knows
[46:46] that it's going to be fine. Amen. Amen.
[46:49] And you walk positive. You walk
[46:51] straight. Sometimes we don't rejoice
[46:53] enough because we don't have that
[46:55] substance. Amen. I'm I'm I'm stirring up
[46:59] a little bit. I'm stirring myself a
[47:00] little bit. Sometimes because I know I
[47:02] can't rejoice now because you know what?
[47:05] Because it might turn out differently.
[47:07] Oh, so that's why you don't rejoice.
[47:09] That's why you don't you don't thank God
[47:11] today. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm waiting to
[47:13] see the result first and then I'll thank
[47:15] God. No, that's not how a Christian
[47:17] works. You thank God already today. God,
[47:20] thank you for healing me. Thank you for
[47:22] providing. Thank you for answering to my
[47:25] prayers before I see the result.
[47:28] I need to move from hope to faith. And
[47:31] God, you have already answered my
[47:33] prayers. You have already given me, you
[47:36] have already given me the substance
[47:37] substance of the reality of it. Now my
[47:40] sense has to go and catch up with the
[47:43] reality that the super sense has already
[47:45] caught. Amen. Faith is a revelation.
[47:49] Someone the neighbor next to the
[47:50] neighbor to the neighbor to you might
[47:53] not see it but you see it. You know it.
[47:56] You know that it's going to be here. Oh,
[47:58] can you prove that to me? I can't prove
[48:00] to you but it revealed to me. Anything
[48:03] that God has revealed to your soul that
[48:05] is yours, believe that is yours. Amen.
[48:09] Perfect faith. Anything that God has
[48:11] revealed to your soul that is yours,
[48:14] claim it that it's yours. Amen. Amen.
[48:17] That's why the prophet says we can never
[48:20] overemphasize the importance of
[48:22] revelation. The importance of
[48:25] revelation, the importance of faith. But
[48:27] I've already heard it many times
[48:29] actually in preparation. I'm thinking to
[48:31] bring a little bit of Syria. I'll talk a
[48:34] bit more on many sermons on on faith and
[48:37] and and the statue of of the perfect
[48:39] man. But you start by that. So so maybe
[48:43] on preparation on that what I'm going to
[48:46] What I would go to uh faith we can never
[48:50] overemphasize the importance of faith to
[48:54] a believer not to an unbeliever to a
[48:56] believer means I believe already but God
[48:59] wants again to over to come and
[49:01] emphasize on it and repeat upon it you
[49:03] are a believer you are a believer keep
[49:06] your your faith is your victory if you
[49:09] lose your faith you have lost everything
[49:11] because your faith is your victory your
[49:14] faith is your revelation. Your faith is
[49:17] what is going to give you authority over
[49:19] the enemy. God, give us more faith. Give
[49:22] us more revelation. We should pray for
[49:24] more revelation. We should pray for more
[49:27] faith. God, make the word of God a
[49:29] reality to me. I've read it many times.
[49:32] I've read it many times. But now I want
[49:34] it to become my possession. I want it to
[49:36] become a reality to me for the situation
[49:39] I'm going through. Yesterday it was a
[49:41] different situation. Today I have a
[49:42] different situation. by the word of God
[49:44] still applies to every situation. Faith
[49:48] is the master of circumstances.
[49:50] Not only one circumstance, for all
[49:52] circumstances. No matter happened to our
[49:55] lives, our faith is our victory. Our
[49:58] faith is the master of the
[50:00] circumstances. Amen. Amen.
[50:03] We should not be we should not be
[50:05] discouraged. The enemy is the master of
[50:07] discouragement. You know of the believer
[50:10] what comes even one of the great
[50:12] prophets one of the greatest prophet or
[50:14] the greatest prophet from the old
[50:16] testament
[50:17] the new testament john the baptist he
[50:19] had faith but at some point his his his
[50:22] eye got blurred because of
[50:25] discouragement
[50:26] but but thank God the lord Jesus Christ
[50:28] is so merciful he came and he gave to
[50:31] him and he came those his disciple came
[50:33] and asked him are you the one who has to
[50:35] come or are we should we expect another
[50:39] Well, thank the Lord Jesus Christ. The
[50:41] way he answered to that, isn't it? He
[50:43] didn't say, "No, no, he didn't he didn't
[50:45] he didn't he didn't focus on what and on
[50:47] how his faith became a little bit
[50:49] blurred, but focus on who he is. What
[50:52] did you go and see there's there's a
[50:55] greater is the greater of all the
[50:57] woman's is the one was born. He's the is
[50:59] more than a prophet." But he focus on on
[51:02] on how he became a little bit dim in his
[51:04] faith. Why? Because he was discouraged.
[51:07] The enemy likes to put discouragement on
[51:09] the believers, but God, thank God for
[51:11] his word to bring us back to recognize
[51:13] who we are in God's word.
[51:21] Amen. Excuse me.
[51:25] I want to go
[51:31] my voice becoming a little bit dry
[51:33] there.
[51:39] So pray for more revelation. Amen. Pray
[51:43] for in this story that we just read
[51:44] here. It was a difficult time. It's a
[51:46] time of hab difficult time. Time of
[51:49] famine, time of bad economy, times of
[51:52] different things. But that widow was
[51:55] part of a different economy. We have
[51:57] been affected for the world and
[51:59] different situation as mentioned it.
[52:03] different situation can be at the job,
[52:05] it can be it can be the economy. It can
[52:07] be the it can be what the trade we can
[52:10] be the tariff and different things
[52:11] affecting us. It affecting us. We are
[52:14] part of that. We are part of that and it
[52:16] affect our job. It affect here. It
[52:18] affect our economy. We we're being paid
[52:20] the same salary but we go to the stores
[52:22] and doesn't seems like it's not fitting
[52:25] anymore and we get stressed and all
[52:27] different things. That that's real life.
[52:31] Whether you're a Christian or not the
[52:32] Christian, you stay affected by it. But
[52:34] let me remind you also part of God's
[52:37] economy. That widow was part of God's
[52:40] economy. God was still watching over
[52:42] her. Amen. She was still watching over
[52:45] her and he couldn't leave her. The good
[52:48] thing the prophet says she she she God
[52:51] commanded the prophet to commanded a
[52:54] woman to sustain a prophet. Herself
[52:58] didn't even know that she was commanded
[52:59] by God. She was unaware of what was
[53:02] happening. Sometimes we are unaware of
[53:04] what we have been happening. But God
[53:06] commanded you and I to sustain his word
[53:09] for this age. God has selected you. God
[53:12] has elected you to be part of God's
[53:15] economy. Amen. While the world is going
[53:17] down in great famine, the famine in the
[53:20] natural famine, but also
[53:23] especially in the spiritual famine, God
[53:25] has elected you to receive the word of
[53:28] the age. We should be more thankful for
[53:31] God's grace in our life. Amen. We are
[53:34] part of God's economy. Listen to what
[53:36] the prophet says. How this little woman
[53:38] must have been of the caliber of Elijah.
[53:42] Because usually
[53:44] your action shows what you are. And
[53:46] again, she had been chosen to entertain
[53:48] God's prophet. Remember, she was a
[53:50] Gentile, not a Jew.
[53:53] A type of you and I. Gentiles. And the
[53:56] land was burning up. And no doubt that
[53:58] the little woman being of that caliber,
[54:00] being of that believer type, for we see
[54:02] that God would not have called to her if
[54:05] she hadn't been a worthy one to
[54:07] entertain God's prophet. If he would
[54:09] have never sent his prophet to a house
[54:12] that was unworthy. It was not his
[54:15] choosing or Elijah's choosing. It was
[54:17] God's choosing. It wasn't her beating
[54:21] him. It was God's bidding him to go to
[54:25] her. He has been placed by a brook. He
[54:27] has been placed by a brook. The ravens
[54:29] were feeding him. As as as brother
[54:32] Victor said, you know, God can put you
[54:34] in the care of Satan can be taking care
[54:36] of you. Reverends here were taking care
[54:39] of the prophet. Amen. Re sometimes are
[54:43] symbols of of bad things. But but here
[54:45] they were taking care of the prophet.
[54:47] But it was God's command for something
[54:49] to take place. God surely went to a
[54:51] believer of the same nature of Elijah. I
[54:54] always like this statement. If the word
[54:56] of God came to us, if the prophet came
[54:58] to us, the word of God came to us, it
[55:01] means we are believers of the same
[55:03] nature of the prophet that we have
[55:06] received. We can claim the same promises
[55:09] that God gave to the prophet and claim
[55:11] them to us as well because we are of the
[55:14] same nature. We are of the same caliber.
[55:16] Amen. He was only the wave shift showing
[55:19] that there will be another people that
[55:20] will come after him that will come to
[55:23] the same maturity that he was that that
[55:25] he was. If he had the faith of God, we
[55:28] should have the faith of God. Amen. If
[55:30] he was so certain of God's word, we
[55:33] should be certain of God's word. Amen.
[55:35] Not only hoping.
[55:38] I hope I hope we understand what I'm
[55:40] doing. We should not only hope. We
[55:42] should be certain of the word of God.
[55:44] I'm certain I will make it in the
[55:47] rapture. Amen. Not I'm hoping I I No,
[55:51] I'm hoping I will be part of the
[55:52] rapture. I hope if God finds me, you
[55:56] know. No, no, no, no, no.
[55:58] I'm sure I'm certain by God's grace I'll
[56:03] be part of the rapture.
[56:06] Actually, if there is only one person in
[56:08] the city, I should be the one in the
[56:10] rapture heaven. Hallelujah. We should
[56:13] have the same testimony.
[56:15] Even though if the mistakes and
[56:17] everything, you confess everything to
[56:20] God. So you are pure before God. If
[56:22] there is one person saved in the city of
[56:25] Edmonton, it's me. You can you can you
[56:29] can you can even you can even challenge
[56:30] your pastor. You know, pastor, you know
[56:32] what? If there is one in the city, it's
[56:34] me. You better be careful.
[56:37] I would be Oh, that's good. that he he's
[56:40] sure of what he knows. Amen.
[56:43] We repeat that on the We repeat that on
[56:45] on it was wonderful wonderful communion
[56:48] service. Amen. Communion. I I God has
[56:51] forgiven me. I do it by faith. Amen. Not
[56:54] on myself. It's righteousness of God. If
[56:57] you look at ourself, we are bound to
[56:59] fail. But if you look at God's grace, we
[57:02] can never fail it. Amen. Amen. That's
[57:05] why we come in prayer with faith. God,
[57:07] I'm praying. Not no not. Oh Lord, I'm
[57:11] Lord, would you please by your grace, I
[57:13] hope you can understand me. And no,
[57:16] Lord, I confess my sins. Lord, you know
[57:19] my mistake. Forgive me. I'm nothing. I'm
[57:22] a failure to begin with according to
[57:24] this flesh. But because of what you put
[57:26] inside of me, Lord, I thank you for your
[57:28] grace. I'm coming claiming your promise,
[57:31] claiming your word. Your word is the
[57:34] truth. Lord, I have symptoms. I have
[57:36] problems. I can't understand. The
[57:38] doctors have given up on me. The
[57:39] situation is getting bad for my family.
[57:42] But I still trust in you, Lord. I thank
[57:44] you. You have answered to my prayer.
[57:47] Oh God, actually God is testing his own
[57:50] faith that he put inside of us. Amen. A
[57:53] believer, our life on earth is only
[57:57] action and reaction. Do you know that?
[57:59] God gives you the word and he's taking
[58:01] he's checking on the reaction. Oh, you
[58:04] say amen. Oh, I thank Lord my son. I
[58:06] recognize it. If you don't recognize it,
[58:08] then he waits a little bit. Sometimes he
[58:10] chastise you a little bit. Then he gives
[58:11] you again action and your reaction.
[58:14] Amen. And sometimes he give you he gives
[58:16] you his own faith. Now he's testing his
[58:19] own faith inside of you. I give you my
[58:22] faith. Now I'm testing you. Hey, what do
[58:23] you do with my Oh, do you say amen to
[58:26] God? Yes, Lord. When a problem comes,
[58:28] oh, how are you going to react? He
[58:30] called Moses, but he didn't put him in a
[58:33] in a straight path to go to Egypt, to go
[58:36] to to the Canaan. He took him through
[58:38] the rough path. They took him to the Red
[58:40] Sea to put in front of the Red Sea. Now
[58:43] he's checking the reaction of Moses to
[58:45] the to the Red Sea. Moses came, but God,
[58:48] you called me, but this is a different
[58:50] situation. I don't know how to react on
[58:52] it. Look, the Egyptian are behind me,
[58:54] and I can't go to the right. I can't go
[58:56] to the left.
[58:58] Yeah, I can't go in front. The only the
[59:00] only way is you, Lord. But why? Why,
[59:02] Lord? Why? Why, Lord? God, look. Oh,
[59:05] look. Look at the reaction. That's not
[59:06] the reaction I was expecting. Why are
[59:08] you crying, Moses? I called you. You
[59:12] have a purpose. Now, your bride, I
[59:14] called you. You, I gave you the word of
[59:16] God. And gave you the assurance. Speak
[59:20] the word of God. And Moses recognizes,
[59:23] oh yeah, I should speak the word of God.
[59:26] This Egyptian that you see, you shall
[59:28] see them no more. Amen. The problem that
[59:30] you have, you shall see no more. How
[59:33] it's going to happen? I don't know. But
[59:35] God gave me the word of promise. And I
[59:37] claim that and I thank God. I keep
[59:39] moving forward. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[59:43] Lord, help me to move from hope
[59:46] to faith.
[59:49] Because hope can be my my worst enemy
[59:52] sometimes because I just, you know, I'm
[59:54] hoping it's going to be fine, you know.
[59:56] Oh, and it looks like he's positive.
[1:00:00] I'm just hoping
[1:00:02] Abraham, you're going to have a son.
[1:00:11] The Bible says he believed
[1:00:13] in the New Testament by grace. He
[1:00:16] believed. But in the real life, it look
[1:00:18] like how he went through. He took all he
[1:00:21] took his father. It took Lot and he took
[1:00:24] Sarah
[1:00:26] and Abraham in the natural life is going
[1:00:29] there. He's struggling a little bit if
[1:00:31] you love me. You I believe maybe a
[1:00:33] little bit of hope. I'm still strong.
[1:00:35] Sarah is still strong. We might still
[1:00:38] God gave us the promise and she's she's
[1:00:40] terrible. She's barren. But I hope it's
[1:00:42] going to be fine. I believe it's going
[1:00:43] to be fine. But as age is going up as
[1:00:46] Gab is going. Oh. Oh. What's going on
[1:00:48] here? What's going on here? Oh, now I'm
[1:00:50] los Now Sarah. No, Sarah disqualified.
[1:00:53] No, now maybe let let me take a Heggar.
[1:00:56] Maybe I hope it is the promise is true.
[1:00:58] Hear I hope because I'm still strong. I
[1:01:02] can then God take No, it's not Hagga.
[1:01:05] It's you me 75 and 90. No strength
[1:01:10] anymore. Hope gone. Now he has to
[1:01:13] believe against any hope. The Bible
[1:01:15] says,
[1:01:17] excuse me, he has to hope and believe
[1:01:20] against any hope because there is no
[1:01:22] hope. And when there's no hope, then
[1:01:24] faith has to step in. Oh, God promised
[1:01:28] and God is going to fulfill his word. I
[1:01:32] have to believe. When there is no hope
[1:01:34] at all, when we can't understand, when
[1:01:37] there is no plan B, God, you are the
[1:01:40] only plan I can trust. You are the only
[1:01:43] plan I can put my hope on. Amen. Lord, I
[1:01:46] want to trust you. Not only hope you
[1:01:49] want now to trust and have faith in the
[1:01:51] word of God when I cannot understand
[1:01:54] because faith is the substance for
[1:01:56] things we hope for
[1:01:59] when there is no hope anymore. Amen.
[1:02:03] Are you with me this evening? Amen.
[1:02:12] Prophet says, you know,
[1:02:15] we believed in God. It's strange, most
[1:02:18] strange that sometimes God has does
[1:02:20] these things that way. You know, when we
[1:02:22] have confessed our sins and met every
[1:02:24] requirement that God requires. We
[1:02:27] believed on God. There is a s
[1:02:29] circumstances that has to be met and
[1:02:32] it's according to his will. We have
[1:02:34] confessed our sins and made all the
[1:02:36] wrongs that we have did and right done
[1:02:40] everything that we know how to do every
[1:02:43] requirement that God has made and ask
[1:02:44] and we met that requirement. Yet God
[1:02:48] lays silent.
[1:02:51] He just doesn't answer us. Oh then you
[1:02:54] check this one. You check this one. You
[1:02:55] check this one. You remove every stone.
[1:02:57] You check. Still God stays quiet.
[1:03:01] And sometimes say oh no you know it must
[1:03:04] be it must what I've done this you conf
[1:03:07] you confess it and you come back you
[1:03:08] confess second time third time because
[1:03:10] you are struggling.
[1:03:13] Amen. The devil is coming is keep
[1:03:15] condemning you on then said no
[1:03:20] don't lose hope don't lose faith
[1:03:23] says I'm sure that I'm speaking to
[1:03:25] people this morning who has come to that
[1:03:27] place. I've been there many times myself
[1:03:29] when I've went back and traced my life
[1:03:31] and turned over every stone and I find
[1:03:34] that I've did something wrong and I've
[1:03:36] done I'd go and confess it and say Lord
[1:03:38] God I'll make it right and do and go do
[1:03:41] so then come back and again say now Lord
[1:03:44] Lord God you'll answer me surely I've
[1:03:47] met every request that you required me
[1:03:49] to do and every requirement I've made it
[1:03:51] and still he won't move it seems to be
[1:03:54] silent that's when you've God to be sure
[1:03:58] that he is God.
[1:04:01] Don't be discouraged.
[1:04:03] The only thing is that in your heart to
[1:04:07] be certain of God. Amen. Say be certain
[1:04:10] first before you do anything. Be certain
[1:04:13] in your heart that it's God. When you
[1:04:16] have met everything that he said, then
[1:04:18] you would be sure that is God. That when
[1:04:21] faith goes to work right there, faith
[1:04:24] stands steady. has it know for it knows
[1:04:28] what he is that he is. Amen. You met
[1:04:30] every requirement. You believe that he
[1:04:32] is and faith holds steady. Blessed be
[1:04:35] the name. Blessed be the name of the
[1:04:37] Lord. Faith won't move for it's sure
[1:04:39] that God is and reward of those who
[1:04:41] diligently seek him. Amen. Man you have
[1:04:45] done all the requirement. You have
[1:04:46] answered to you done all that. You have
[1:04:48] confessed your sins. Now let your faith
[1:04:52] stay steady. Lord, I don't know how, but
[1:04:55] I just believe your word. And now I can
[1:04:57] start praising you because I know you
[1:05:00] have already answered because your word
[1:05:03] can never fail. Amen.
[1:05:06] I might be closing your save time.
[1:05:09] Faith comes by prophecy. Faith is burly.
[1:05:12] Now my how I like to think of faith.
[1:05:15] Hope, faith and charity. Those three
[1:05:17] things and hope. What a beautiful thing.
[1:05:20] Hope thing hope is little timid hope
[1:05:24] lively sweet as she is yet yet she's the
[1:05:29] greatest enemy faith has
[1:05:33] right the greatest enemy faith is God is
[1:05:36] hope because a person becomes so hopeful
[1:05:40] till they leave away from faith
[1:05:44] become so hopeful oh lord I I hope it
[1:05:47] turn out because the things I might
[1:05:49] doing I hope it just turn
[1:05:50] But then they don't exercise their faith
[1:05:54] then faith becomes dormant becomes then
[1:05:57] hope becomes the enemy of of faith
[1:06:03] says hope will agree with the Bible.
[1:06:06] Hope will say it's true. Hope will say I
[1:06:08] believe every bit of it. I believe
[1:06:10] that's the word of God. I believe that
[1:06:12] God will keep his promise. Hope believes
[1:06:14] all that. Hope then says now I believe
[1:06:17] that God will heal. But look at my
[1:06:20] condition.
[1:06:22] But now faith don't look at that. Faith
[1:06:24] comes around. I don't care nothing about
[1:06:27] conditions.
[1:06:29] God said so and it's mine. You see faith
[1:06:32] it's b faith it's burly. As I once said
[1:06:36] faith has hair on the chest when it
[1:06:38] stand up and pull it big muscles out and
[1:06:41] everything else vanishes away. Just take
[1:06:44] flies away. When faith really takes a
[1:06:46] hold nothing else stands. I'm telling
[1:06:48] you faith. You've got to have hope and
[1:06:50] charity. If you've got really burly
[1:06:52] faith, no love with it, you'll ruin your
[1:06:55] influence before the people if you
[1:06:58] haven't love God mixed with it. You see,
[1:07:00] see people a really burly. But what
[1:07:02] you'll say, excuse expression, a bulldog
[1:07:05] faith to grab a hold, but it's so rough
[1:07:07] with it. Then you see when you do that,
[1:07:10] it doesn't got the kindness here to move
[1:07:12] with it. So what we need is hope, faith
[1:07:16] and charity. Isn't that right? Hope,
[1:07:19] faith and charity together. God help our
[1:07:22] church to have it like that. The people
[1:07:25] to have that combination. That's our
[1:07:28] prayer. God help me to have hope but
[1:07:30] help me to move to faith. And perfect
[1:07:34] faith requires love of God.
[1:07:37] Give me your love, Lord. And then
[1:07:39] prophet says just
[1:07:41] paragraph 929. But if you just rely on
[1:07:45] hope, you hinder faith. Hope looks for
[1:07:49] something way off, but faith claims it
[1:07:52] right now. Faith says God said so and
[1:07:55] it's mine that settles it. Hope look for
[1:08:00] a future expectation. Oh, it might work,
[1:08:02] but faith says it's working now. God is
[1:08:06] already working now. That's why I'm
[1:08:08] praising God today because God is
[1:08:10] already working now. I don't see it, but
[1:08:13] I'm already thanking him, Lord. Thank
[1:08:15] you. Thank you, Lord, for help. Thank
[1:08:17] you for healing me. Thank you for saving
[1:08:19] my family. Thank you for keeping me.
[1:08:22] Thank you for blessing our church. Thank
[1:08:25] you for saving this the lost one.
[1:08:30] Amen. Amen.
[1:08:35] says, "What about our family?" Jehovah
[1:08:37] Jarus says, "Just believe on the Lord
[1:08:40] Jesus Christ and thou and the house
[1:08:41] shall be saved." If you can't believe
[1:08:44] for yourself, you can believe for your
[1:08:46] household. If you can believe for
[1:08:47] yourself, you can believe for your house
[1:08:50] also. Have enough faith in God to
[1:08:52] believe for yourself. Then believe for
[1:08:55] your children also. The same faith will
[1:08:59] save your children that saved you. Amen.
[1:09:02] That same faith will save your children
[1:09:04] that saved you. If you just keep
[1:09:06] praying, God will answer prayer. Don't
[1:09:10] worry. Amen. So, I'm not only hoping,
[1:09:14] I'm believing. I'm trusting in God. I'm
[1:09:17] say God you are saving my children. You
[1:09:20] are working on my on my family. Oh, I
[1:09:23] don't see the result. I develop symptoms
[1:09:26] and conditions. Lord, I'm thanking you
[1:09:28] already today because your my faith
[1:09:31] doesn't look at the condition. It says
[1:09:33] today God is working. Amen. Amen. May
[1:09:36] God bless you. Let's give a hand to the
[1:09:38] Lord this evening.
[1:09:44] No matter the situations like this
[1:09:46] woman, she was hoping she was hoping
[1:09:48] hoping a different maybe my cousin might
[1:09:51] help me. Maybe the situation might help
[1:09:52] me. Maybe. But then that saved the Lord
[1:09:56] came into that save the Lord. The bride
[1:09:59] has received that saved the Lord. We
[1:10:02] have received that save the Lord from
[1:10:03] God. And we know that everything he said
[1:10:07] is going to accomplish. And when she
[1:10:09] went, did the meal diminish?
[1:10:13] No. Did the oil finish? No. Because that
[1:10:17] said the Lord said it will be there
[1:10:18] every day. A miracle will be there every
[1:10:21] day. That God of the Old Testament is
[1:10:24] the same God for you and me. Amen. We
[1:10:27] can claim on God's promises for our
[1:10:29] lives, for healing, for a job, for a
[1:10:32] situation. If you read be certain of God
[1:10:34] like this thought, the prophet is going
[1:10:36] actually to normal situations we go
[1:10:38] through. Maybe you don't have the bills
[1:10:40] to pay for your house. Maybe you don't
[1:10:42] know how to pay for the food for your
[1:10:44] children. Maybe you don't you have
[1:10:46] situation for sickness. Real normal
[1:10:49] things we all of us go through. And he's
[1:10:51] praying for that. He's saying the same
[1:10:53] God be just be certain of God. The same
[1:10:56] God of the Old Testament is the same God
[1:10:59] amidst. Amen. May God bless you. Amen.

[1:11:18] him.

[1:13:04] I've
[1:13:06] many tears and sorrows.
[1:13:10] I've had questions for tomorrow.
[1:13:15] There have been times I didn't know
[1:13:18] right from wrong.
[1:13:23] But in every situation,
[1:13:27] God gives blessed consolation
[1:13:32] that my trials will only come to make me
[1:13:37] strong.
[1:13:39] Through it all, through it all.
[1:13:46] Oh, through it all,
[1:13:51] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[1:13:55] I've learned to trust in God.
[1:14:00] Through it all,

[1:14:22] and I thank him for the valleys.

[1:14:31] me through.

[1:14:42] I wouldn't know that he could solve.

[1:16:15] with faith knowing that God is going to
[1:16:17] answer to our need. Let's go in prayer.
