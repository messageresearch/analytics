Father, may the Holy Spirit come and give us the context of your word and help us, Lord, to have a closer walk with you. We give you the glory and the honor. We thank you for the weekend. Thank you for your presence and Lord that we desire just to go further with you every step of the way. &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name, we humble ourselves. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You to go to the word of God in Luke 17:30 just a portion of that and then we jump to Luke 18 scripture Luke 17:30 then jump to Luke 18:30 says Even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed. So it gives out the symptoms and the things that happening in time of Noah, things that happened in the time of Lot or which was also the time of Abraham and then he compared that to the time we are living in when the son of man is being revealed. Then he gives a parable in 18 just after that gives a parable of 18. He says as he spoke a parable unto them to this to this end that man ought always to pray and not to faint. So it's a prayer meeting today. It says saying there was in a city a judge which feared not God neither regarded man. And there was a widow in that city. She came unto him, saying, "Avenge me of mine adversary." And he would not for a while. But afterward he said within himself, "Though I fear not God, nor regard men, yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she wear me." And the Lord said, "Hear what the unjust judge saith. And shall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him, though he bear he bear long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth. Amen. May God bless his word and have a seat. We should never be wary of of praying. Should never say no, I've already prayed enough. Already mentioned that to God. So that I will not repeat that again. But God likes to hear our prayers. Amen. God likes to enjoy our prayers. And then whenever we say that, never give up. Continue to knock. Continue to knock on the door. Lord, you know I need. Lord, you know my situation. I keep knocking on the door. And the prophet says, Not a simple knock is a continual knock. Continue knocking. And the one who knocks it will be open to him. And if the unjust will just the unjust was was answering to the prayer of that widow even though he was not fearing God, how much more God will answer to the prayer of his own elect. The Bible says his own elect means himself has elected those. Himself has made a choice. How can't he put some time to answer to this to the prayer of those who cry unto him? Is the same God today who knows our needs, who knows, he knows our situation, who knows our condition, and he's there to answer to our prayer. Amen. &gt;&gt; So never give up on praying Lord. Never give up on praying on your family. Never give up on praying on your situation. Never never give up on God. God is not tired. Amen. God is actually happy and he will answer even though God is has a certain principles and know sometimes he knows the needs but he just want to hear from you that you can express that need to you know sometimes God you know after the resurrection when he came to the disciples he looked like he was about to go a certain way even though himself desired to reveal to his disciples but he did like he was going to go away then the disciple had to stop master why can't you spend a moment with us. Then he he solded that desire and then he respond to that desire and he revealed himself in a greater way. So God likes to be stopped. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many want to stop God? &gt;&gt; God I want to stop you. Amen. &gt;&gt; As a as a batimus the blind Batimir God. Oh son of David here son son of them have mercy upon me. The same voice of of of the same faith of in Batimirus stopped the son of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prophet will take that in that message says you know he was he was thinking about what his mother told him about Joshua. Joshua had to stop the son the natural son. Now him had to stop the the the son of God. Amen. The s o n of God. Praise be to God. I would like to go a little bit on a thought and we had said that we had a wonderful message and brother um brother brother Daily preached a message and I had to accompany me to to to manifested word and sprove there to preach on the evening and he preached another good message and I was thinking oh I'll be good some some of the messages I that maybe he preached he will preach maybe one of the messages that he preached here and I will hear it again and sometimes you hear a message and few things still passes you over and I was going there I will hear it again and he went there and he preached a different message completely different message and it was as good as the messages that he preach here amen and some of the thoughts were kind of parallel of what I was thinking to talk about so I didn't want you to miss that as well so I might go to some of the thought that he shared over there and just to put it together and what uh I also wanted to see to share with you uh in few minutes. Amen. I have 20 minutes. I'll try to speed up on that. Amen. Are you with me this evening? &gt;&gt; I'll try to condense something of one hour into 20 minutes. So I would like to talk a little bit on the rapturing condition. Rapturing condition. Amen. Rapturing condition as the question has been asked. Nevertheless, when the son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth? When the son of man comes, he's not interested to see other so many other things. He's interested to see one important thing. His own faith. Can he find the faith of God on the earth? He's not asking to the cosmos. Not asking to the other unbelievers. He's asking to the true believers. Because even this parable that he gave there, he's talking to his own elect. So according to his own elect, he's asking them a question. When I shall be revealed, when I shall come, can I find? Can you guarantee me that I will find my faith inside of you? Amen. That's the most important thing. The prophet will talk about this condition corruption conditions only in one message. Perfect faith. And I'll just read that sentence quickly so that he gives you the picture. He says, "So when a man lives by faith and walks by faith, I mean substance faith is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you have the substance faith, you are isolated from the world. You don't think like the world you think differently. You have a super sense as we saw last time. You people of the world cannot understand. You cannot understand some of the decisions that you are making because the decisions are not based on the five senses of the flesh, five senses of the mind that based upon the word of God. You see things that they cannot see. Amen. because you have the substance faith a reality of a faith of God and when you have that you are isolated from the world and you become a new creature in Christ he says now then you are getting into bride material in other words means you cannot part you cannot say you are part of the bride if you don't start by the first step of the new creation in Christ you cannot go anywhere without starting by the new birth then he says see you are getting into rapturing ing conditions. So the rapture is not just one event like this. No, the rapture is actually you have to be in that conditions. You have to be you have to be in that in in that in that environment in that atmosphere and then the rapture will happen. Amen. Actually the process as we heard it on the weekend the process of the rapture has already started. Amen. We are already in the cycle of his coming. Amen. We are not waiting for we we are not we are not waiting for for the cycle to start. We are waiting for the departure. Amen. Which will be the climax of his coming. But we are already in the cycle of his coming. If you miss the cycle of the coming there is little hope to be part of that climax of the clim of the coming of the Lord. So we need to get into the rapturing conditions. The world is already in the conditions of being destroyed. Amen. You have to be in the spirit of the end time in order for the destruction of the end time to come. You have to be in the spirit of the rapture in order for the rapture to happen. Amen. Remember, John had to be in the Lord's in the Lord's day. Amen. He had to be in the spirit. He had to get into the spirit in order to see the things that will happen the Lord's day. Amen. The Lord's day is the day of the coming of the Lord. Amen. So, you have to be in the rapturing condition. that he says we are getting into rapturing conditions now. That means for each one of us, not just the pastor, not just the deacons, not just the trustees, that means for the lady, every individuals walks in a world with God alone. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are you have to walk with God alone. It has to become a personal revelation. It have to become a personal walk with God. You cannot rely on the church group. You cannot rely even the the the stamp of the message believers. No, it has to become a personal revelation with God. And we are we are believers here. We all that we know. But it's good to remind that. Amen. He says we are baptized into his kingdom and there is nobody in there but you and God. He gives the orders and you pack them out. Whatever he says there is no there's not a shout of doubt. nowhere. He walks right on. If the Lord says this, there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it. You go right on. That's the same. Now you are getting into perfect faith. Perfect perfection that cannot fail. Amen. That faith never fails. Yes, he was a mystic to them with his perfect faith. And so is it now for those who have perfect faith a mystic to others. Why that mystic to others? because they cannot understand you. Jesus Christ was a mystic to others because he was in the world but he was also in another world. Amen. &gt;&gt; We as a two two beings two two two worlds in one being. One being in two worlds. Let me say one one person in two worlds. Amen. We also here we are in this world but we are not part of this world. Amen. The bride is in the leodia age but is not in Leodia. The bride in last year age, but he's also in the bride age. Amen. In order to be part of the rapture, you have to be in the bride age. Amen. You have to rise up. Come up, John. John, you are the bride. Come up. Amen. You have to get out of the denominations. That's why when the seven sins come, you are not part of the denomination ages is over. Because you cannot think as denominations anymore. You think as God things. Amen. You don't have your own thought anymore. You have God's thoughts now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God, may you give us the mind of Christ to think like Christ to to to behave like Christ, to speak like Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let it be our desire. &gt;&gt; The more this flesh dies, the more he's taking the preeminence and we want him to have the primance. So the prophet says Jesus lived in a world that nobody else could touch. The disciples couldn't understand him. When he spoke to them they say this they say this and then they said why why you talk in riddles we don't understand how can this say that was not they was not in the world that he lived in he lived in a different world they could not understand him nobody could understand him then the prophet say we are told resist the devil and you will flee from thee to resist is to to to just simply turn him down Just resist him. Just walk away from him. God said a certain thing. No matter what he's trying to tell you, you don't even listen to him. Don't mind the devil. How can you know that he's the devil when he's trying to tell you something that is not confessing the word of God? &gt;&gt; If you are sick and he come say you know you will not you you you will die of it. Who told you you will die like that? I'm already healed. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If he tells you, "No, you are not going to make it. Oh, you are too late. I'm already pregnantated by the word of God. I will make it." Amen. &gt;&gt; You cannot feel it. But I know that something happened in my heart. Of course, I'm not what I ought to be. I'm not what even what I should be, but I know from where I come from. And I know that something has happened in my heart. Why? It is a personal revelation to you. Amen. You can say to the enemy, "Boo devil." Amen. If you want, the devil will never say something to encourage you. Never. Never. He will never quote the word of God in order to encourage you. He always quot the word of God in order to put that inside of you. If you are really a son of God, if you are really a daughter of God, you should do this. You should do this. This Oh, I am a daughter of God. I am a son of God. Why? Because my desires have changed. This flesh can put me down but my desire would always point to God. I want to be like God. I want to behave like God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You walk by your desire towards God. Amen. That's why you are here. So it says yes. So you receive the devil. Don't even listen to him. You your ears are deaf to anything else. What? By what the spirit says. To he that has an ear, that listens, see what the spirit said unto the churches. The one that's got the listening post that catches what the spirit says to the churches. Amen. In other words, you know, you don't listen to the devil because the devil in a certain world, you are in a in a different you are soundproof to what the devil is trying to tell you. Completely cut off of what the devil is telling you. That's actually, you know, the the pastor mentioned it on during the weekend. You have your own millennium. You have your own millennium because the devil is he cannot he cannot catch you anymore. The devil is bound. How can the devil be bound? He's bound by the chain of circumstances. He has no place where he can go through. Amen. He still has the flesh but in the soul he cannot. Amen. Even in your mind you start recognizing no this is not this is only the devil. This is only the enemy. The more you grow, the more you become a Christian, you know sometime even a negative thought can come towards your brother, towards your sister. Oh no, why she doesn't? I think and then you realize, oh no, it's only the devil. &gt;&gt; It's not my sister. It's not my brother. It's only the devil. And there he becomes defeated. Amen. &gt;&gt; Very quickly you recognize, oh, I was about to say that. No, no, it's only the devil. It's not my sister. It's not my brother. Oh, we will keep pressing on. Amen. &gt;&gt; I know they love the Lord. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That then the devil has no place where he can work in. That's what will happen in the millennium. But it has already started here. &gt;&gt; We are binding him. We have the power to bind the mamba. &gt;&gt; The the Christian has the power to bind him and to loose him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we are getting into rapturing conditions and rapturing condition. You cannot go into raptured conditions without faith and perfect faith. Amen. Substance faith. We need that substance faith. That's what the son of man in this age when he's being revealed, he want to see that perfect faith. That substance faith. And that's our prayer this morning. And that substance faith will bring you know where where the substance faith is based. The prophet says the faith is based on forgiveness. Oh, I want to be in that in a rapturing conditions. Is there anything in my heart? Lord, take it away. Is any malice, any grudge, any anger, any bitterness, anything negative, Lord, take it away. put me into that rapturing conditions where there is perfect forgiveness where I understand even my brother and my sister when he's weak when she's weak I can understand her in that condition and help her no rise up let's keep pressing on amen don't stay don't if you fall don't stay don't stay in that stages just rise up and let's continue pressing on &gt;&gt; that's where I desire to be in that rapturing condition amen based on forgiveness. &gt;&gt; As I said, prophet, as I said this morning, the church in the place where we could easily or really see apostolic times moving among us. That's what we all hunger to see apostolic times. It's not the miracles and the wonders and God working mighty. The faith of the people being increased and abounding is not only in the old time of books of acts. It was not actually the book of act of the individuals. It was the book of act of the holy ghost in the individuals. It was not the wonders of brother vanam. It was the holy spirit using brother vanam. But if we can heal our vessels the same way as brother vanam heal his vessels. The same god is going to operate among us. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have the same power to stop again that that bull that wild bull the love of god being expressed. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I said it one time in my my sermons. If the love of God can stop an animal that that have doesn't have a soul, you know, that only have working by instant, how much more the love of God can stop someone who has a soul for anything you could do. If I can express to him the love of God, &gt;&gt; if you love someone, he cannot hurt you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you really love them sincerely and and they know that you love them, they can never hurt you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Love, you can never hurt someone and they cannot hurt you if you really love them. &gt;&gt; Brother demonstrated with that person who came, you know, that maniac who came and almost and there was one preacher I said I always like to tell my wife was he was so he was he was making it so funny. He he made it that image that it stays right here says you know I you know you can do to me anything you want you can slap me you can do anything you know I'm a human being you can do to me anything you want but when you get you really take your saliva and you threw it at me no that's too much for me and bra could stand up someone really cry spitting on him wow No. So that always stayed with me because he really did it himself. Know really? So and then to your face. No. Now think about it. If someone does that to you, but the he say I loved him. Even though he did that, I loved him &gt;&gt; and my love was projected on him and he fell on his feet because of the love of God. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise be to God. Amen. So rapturing conditions, God has to prepare us in that rapturing conditions. That's why the brother took it a bit in that angle and I found it so good says God God does not need to prepare anything &gt;&gt; in the sense that is omnipotent. God is omnipotent. He can create he can create anything in one stand. can like we saw the squirrel being created. God can create anything. God can create us in instant and having perfect love and anything. He has no need to prepare us. But God in John 14, he went to prepare a place. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? God omnipotent goes to prepare a place. Why? Because God like to respect the principle of preparation. That's how he put it. God likes to prepare a pre to have a principle of preparation. And us as well as Christians, if we are sons and daughters of God, we need to value preparation because God lacks preparation. Before you come to church, prepare yourself for the church. Stay in that condition. Stay in that atmosphere because God himself who can do things instantly lacks preparation. Amen. &gt;&gt; For anything, God lacks preparation. And he had to send Malachi 4 and Malachi 3 to prepare the way for him. It could have been instant thing but God had to prepare a way. Amen. The same thing for some nature as well. We we can we can be married in instantly you get married. No, God likes the principle of preparation for marriage. You have to go through the cycles and courtship and go to the engagement and then you get married. Amen. The same thing for us. Amen. Even to go into the rapture, he puts us into a cycle of preparation. He has sent us Malachi 4 to prepare us. Amen. He has sent us all of the shout to prepare us for that rapture day. Amen. But it takes a moment and a time and a principle of preparation. And we come to church. Why do we come to church? Because we are preparing ourself for that rapture. Amen. God prepares himself could do things instantly but he goes to prepare a place that place is there for prepared people. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why it's a prepared place for prepared people. Amen. That's why we come to church to prepare oursel. That's why we receive the message to prepare oursel. Amen. That's why we value to pray because we prepare oursel. &gt;&gt; Lord continue to prepare me. Help me to prepare myself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; We can take the same lessons from David and Saul. You know, Saul was a instant instant king. &gt;&gt; He was an instant king. You know, there was a need. The people rejected the prophet. They rejected God. We want a king. We want a king. God says, "It's okay. I will give you one." Amen. And he gave them a king. That king did not go through preparation. He was instant king. Oh, because he looked big. He looked nice and all people. Oh, King Saul. But when trials come, it shows his character because he was not prepared. Character is not a gift. God doesn't give you a good character instantly. God gives you a character that he has to prepare. He has to go through some trials, some training, some suffering, and some some patience in order to build that character. Amen. Then from that character, then you can reign. Amen. That was the difference with David. David, he was anointed. Even though he was a small boy, God already chose him to be a king. He anointed him to be a king. But didn't come the next day. Amen. God had to go through through the school of training, through the school of preparation as he's preparing him. Amen. He meets the bear. He He meets the lion. Amen. He meets the mockery of his brothers. He makes even Goliath. All that to prepare him to become the king so that in times in in difficult times he knows how to humble himself. He knows how to take care of the of his sheep. Amen. Even God through running away from the same anointing. The same anointing God gave him. It was the anointing that created more problem for him. Can you think about it? the anointing of becoming king that created more problems for him. That's why the brother mentioned even on Sunday say no sometimes God you don't it's not don't think like when you become a Christian then all the problem are solved instances no intent in instantaneously no sometimes they can even become harder they become when you become Christians why because God is preparing you for that city amen &gt;&gt; so that we don't walk by our senses on the other side we cannot to rely on our senses. We have to rely on one sense, the faith of God. The faith in his in his word. The faith in his God's word will not change. Amen. Even on the other side, we'll be see Oh, God said so. So that nothing can break God's word. Amen. He promised me you have perfect faith. We know everything. Oh, praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I think I lost my thought there, but I will. So David David knew David had to go to the training and when God trained him then God made him a king. &gt;&gt; Amen. And even when he made mistakes he knew how to humble himself before the word of the prophet because he went through a certain training through a certain preparation. Amen. Through a I will call it through a certain conditioning. God was conditioning him. He was he was working on him. He was putting him to a certain form to a certain statute to a certain to certain way where he wants him to be. Oh God, we don't want just to go in heaven without going through the conditioning of God. God, we want to go through your conditioning, rapturing conditioning, through your word preparation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You took in the Bible in looking on the Bible. Esther didn't just go and present herself to the king. Oh, here I'm a king. I'm I'm a virgin. And there so many virgins in that time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But there is one who was special. Amen. And it was Esther. &gt;&gt; Why? She had a desire to accept to be conditioned. She had a desire to be prepared. And she find favor with Hega. Whatever Hega was saying, Esther will say, "Oh, I love that. I accept that. I believe what you say because you know the king better than I know." &gt;&gt; Thank God for Malachi 4. He knows the king better than we know. Amen. He was talking to God face to face. Amen. He was talking with the angels face to face. We were not there. He knows what the angels knows. Amen. He knows even the song that the angels like. &gt;&gt; Who can say this song? Who who can you go in any denomination say you know this song the angel told me that this is song that he likes &gt;&gt; who can say that who has that authority to say that &gt;&gt; but we have the privilege to know &gt;&gt; oh this song the angel likes it. Amen. He feels welcome when you see oh Lord oh I believe Lord I believe. He loves when you tell him that you believe the word of God. Oh, praise be to God. Thank you for the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; So Esther knew that he knows what the kings want. And then the he was preparing her. No, this is what you have to do. This is the anointing. This is the perfume he likes. This is what the kind of dress he likes. So before you present yourself to him, this is how you have to be dressed. And she prepared herself. And because she prepared, she condition herself and then the king accepted find favor in her as well. Oh, this one, this one, how come she smells the way I like? How come? Look how she's come. Oh, the kind of dress I like. Oh, no. No different things. No different to make yourself blue, green. No, no, no, no, no, no. Even though you're a virgin, a Christ, call yourself Christian. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no high heels and no no no no no short skirts there. No, no, no. My guy must be talking. Tell her what I like. Amen. &gt;&gt; She doesn't take it as an orders that oh no this is I used to be I used to do that when I you used to be in Ireland. I used to do that when I was in Italy. I used to do that when I was in Africa. So why is you here? I used to change. No here you're in presence of the king. It's not about countries. It's not about No, this is the preparation to meet the king. &gt;&gt; This is the preparation for the rapture. Amen. Amen. So you condition yourself to fit the rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then why God accepted her? &gt;&gt; Why God didn't do that miraculous you know you know Rebecca comes, Rebecca comes and you just go and meet the king and that's all you are done. No, she had to go through preparation to the messenger. Amen. To Elazar. I had to prepare her. I had to condition her. I had to tell her what Isa Isaac likes. This is what he likes. This is how you have to present yourself. This is how do you know? Do you know from all the man who was walking around in that field and she has met I don't know how many days, three days, whatever there was, you know, behind the camera. She has met so many men. So many men. But the Bible doesn't mention none of those men. But once she sees Isaac &gt;&gt; says, "Oh, who is that man? Who who is that man? &gt;&gt; Is he is corresponding to the description you have given me of the man I have to meet? And I have prepared myself to meet that man." That's why she could say, "Who is that man from all the other mens?" That's why the bride is not surprised to know Jesus Christ our bridegroom because Malachi 4 has described to us who is our bridegroom and we can see and recognize oh who is this? It can only be the son of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the conditioning we have been under. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. rapturing conditions. Brother took that to as well. And but look at look at look at Mary. Look at Mary. The first coming of the Lord, the virgin shall conceive. The mother Mary answered to her, the virgin shall conceive. I'll be closing. The mer the virgin shall conceive. That scriptures they have been preached for 800 years almost. The virgin shall conceive. The v all the virgin were keeping themselves and oh maybe it might be maybe it might be maybe it might be and maybe it might. Even the prophet says Mary was thinking about that scripture because the preacher spoke about it in the morning and then you thinking oh what did the preacher the virgin shall conceive. Oh wow. as she was thinking about the word of God. That's why we need to continue thinking about the word of God. There's so many distractions, so many things putting putting our thought away from the word of God. But as you stay on the word of God, as you meditate upon the word of God, he comes. He comes. Amen. Oh, God help us to meditate, to think more about Jesus Christ, to talk more about Jesus Christ. Let leave, let leave Trump alone. Let leave Carney and and and Palevo and what let them leave them a little bit alone. Amen. Let's think about God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And she was thinking about that scripture. And then the angel of the Lord came and said, "Oh, Mary, you are beloved. You have found favor with God. You have been chosen. You know you shall you shall give you shall give birth to the son of God &gt;&gt; me. How is it possible? How is it possible? Even though she has been even though she has been preached that word of God has been preached that the word of God has been preached to her. A virgin shall conceive but where it has been addressed to her she still didn't understand. &gt;&gt; She still didn't comprehend how it will happen. So the people of the word of the message or not the people of the message the people in the Christian world they believing in the rapture but the way they are believing in the rapture is not the same way we are believing in the rapture. Amen. Even though we are quoting the same scripture of 1 Thessalonians 4, they can quote it. We are waiting upon the Lord. They're waiting upon the Lord. Like in the first coming, we are waiting upon the Messiah to come through a virgin. But when it happened, they didn't have the revelation of what how it happened. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Mary said, "How can it happen?" I like the way the brother put it says I think maybe in our understanding she was thinking you know the preacher always mentions the virgin shall come and they can't explain that the only way they could explain that is maybe a man will take a virgin may have a son and that son god will make him a messiah because that I couldn't understand how it happened because even Mary had to had to ask the angel How was it possible to happen? Now the the supernatural happens. The angel explained to her the Holy Ghost will come and cover you, overshadow you. Then you shall have a son. &gt;&gt; That revelation, no other churches could have that revelation. No other virgin could have that revelation. That's the same thing for the rapture. Even though they quotes the rapture, even the quotes what first Thessalonians says, but no one has the interpretation of when the Lord is descending, they have a shout, they have the voice, they have a trump, no one can say the shout is the message. Amen. But thank God we have received the revelation of God in order to prepare us to put us in that condition. The angel has told us, you know, the shout is the message. The shout has come to prepare you for the rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; I thank God for that. Praise be to God for the revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost shall come and overshadow you. But you know that even that statement doesn't actually explain too many things. &gt;&gt; It was just a statement to oh something will happen. But then she made a clear statement that should be that should be our prayer. Let it be done to me according to your word. I still don't understand how the overshadowing will the overshadow overshadowing will produce a son. But because you have said it, praise be to God. Let it be done to me according to your word. What will change us? It is the message of the hour. How is it going to happen? I don't understand the mechanic of that, but thank God. Let it be done to me according to your word. I believe your word. Condition me to your word, Lord. Let the word of God wash me. Let the word of God clears me. Let the word of God give me perfect faith. Let the word of God create in me perfect love. Whatever I need to go on the other side. Let the word of God create in me according to your word, Lord. &gt;&gt; Not even my understanding, but according to your word. That's the conditioning that we are under. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you richly. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. So many we could go through but we just uh leave that. Praise be to God. Musicians can come. If you have any special need, you can mention it as a musician is coming. Otherwise, we go to prayer. I'd like to do a little bit of prayer different this evening. Just sing a song, allow someone to pray, sing a song, allow someone to pray, sing a song, allow someone to pray. Brother, sister can feel free to pray and then we'll be backing up your prayer. Amen. My My faith looks up. My faith looks up to the of Calary. Oh savior divine now hear me while I pray take all my guilt away. Oh, let me from this day beholder.

Father, let it be done in our heart, Father, Lord, from the inside out. That's why we desire that to remove any malice to remove anything that is not of yours, any grudge, any bitterness, anything that does not correspond to your word that we father reflect nothing else but Jesus Christ. Let the seed grow, the seed grow, Father, to come to the full maturity of Jesus Christ himself. Lord Lord, I pray for the church. I pray for each family. I pray for the head of homes oh God to be examples to be oh God the representation of Christ to be the priest in their homes father to reflect Christ father wherever we are Lord our desire is to see you more our desire is to be God the the representation of Jesus Christ yourself that you can be manifest in our heart Lord we love you we thank you we believe your word we accept your word we want you to have the preminent star heart. Oh God, thank you for the word. Thank you for the revelation of the word. Let the revelation gives us humility. Let the revelation gives us uh love. Let the revelation give us, Father, Lord, the love we can have for one another, the love for your word, the passion for the things of God. That's what revelation should create, Lord. Not not arrogance, not pride, not lord knowledge only but let become life. Let the revelation brings life in our heart that we can be humble people loving living for one another. Living for others not for ourselves not for our own interest but living for others. Lord bring us that maturity where we can even die for others as Christ died for us. Help us Lord to have that the love of God. Nothing can go on the other side but perfect love, perfect faith, perfect Lord, redemption Lord. Redemption in the soul, redemption in the mind, redemption in the spirit, redemption in the body. Lord, we are waiting for the redemption of the body. But now let the the soul come to the full maturity of itself as it has received the perfect word. We thank you Lord for the conditioning. We thank you father for bringing us little by little as we look into the glass into the mirror of the word of God. We are being transformed from glory to glory to the image of the son of God. We thank you father. We accept your word. Let it be done to us according to your word that the transformation will start from the inside outside. Help us Lord. Give us Lord the revival in our heart.

Someone pray for those who are sick among us, those who are weak. Just pray to the Lord. Precious heavenly father, Lord, we thank you once again. Lord, you promised in your word that healing is the bread for the children. Father Lord, in your word, you said if a child asks you for bread, would you give him would you give him a a serpent, would you give him a stone? How much more our father is gracious and full of love? Will he give the Holy Ghost to those who ask him? Will he give him bread to those who ask him for bread? Father Lord probably some people among us Lord are sick and afflicted in the flesh. Lord Jesus Christ we are coming to you and praying that what you said in your word by your stripes we are already healed. It's a finished work in the work of Calvary. Father this evening Lord we are coming and uniting our faith and pray oh God whoever is sick among us Lord may the person go out from this place completely healed Lord claiming the blood of Jesus Christ father Lord you said in your word these are the signs that shall follow those who believe we are believers in your word father we have the super sense looking not at the symptoms looking not at what the flesh of the mind is saying but father Lord we are praying for our brother for our sister who sick this evening Lord that you will touch them father by the healing power of the Holy Ghost Lord that you restore them in the flesh in the name of Jesus Christ father you like to see us be being healed in the body so that we can praise you we can glorify you we can serve you faithfully father whoever is weak Lord this evening father in the name of Jesus Christ we are declaring them healed we are declaring them restored father Lord Where Father we those who are weak may they be strong in the Lord Jesus Christ. Father Lord you promise in your word oh God Jesus Christ that you are the God who health who heal us for all our diseases all our sicknesses not only some of them but all of them. Father no matter what the name the medicine has given to it. No matter what the complicated name the pharmacies has given to it. But in the name of Jesus Christ father Lord we rebuke any spirit. We cast it in the name of Jesus Christ. And we place the blood of Jesus Christ between the believer and that enemy between father lord our sister and an enemy between the brother and that enemy and remove that curse in the name of Jesus Christ because you took upon you the curse. Every curse has been taken by our Lord Jesus Christ and it has been nailed on the cross of Calvary so that we can be free and we have been declared free. Freedom is here. The healing is here because you promised and because you have already paid the price. So we pray like this, Father, that you increase the faith for each believer to claim what you have already purchased for them and may you heal them and restore them in the name of Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just a close walk with you. [Music] Just closer walk with thee. &gt;&gt; Jesus is my plea. &gt;&gt; Daily walking close to thee. Let it be, dear Lord.

[Music] Dear Lord, it's always a privilege and an honor, Father God, just to &gt;&gt; Yes, Father, &gt;&gt; come before your throne of grace, sons and daughters of God, that you predestinated us, Lord Jesus, before the foundation of the world to just be part of your end time plan, &gt;&gt; to let our light shine, Lord, for the glory of God, to be a a shining light and a witness, Lord. Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; To one lost soul. Father God, we just want to express our love to you tonight, Lord. Lord, we love you, Lord. We thank you for your presence tonight, oh Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord, for using Brother Moses tonight, Lord Jesus. For the song leading, for the musicians, Father, for the brothers and sisters that have gathered here tonight, Lord, in your name, Father God. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Like the song writer said, "Bind us together, oh Lord, in love." &gt;&gt; Lord, that we could love one another unconditionally, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Not to look at the situation, not to look at the circumstances, but Lord, just to look at you and claim that promise, oh, Father God, Lord, for the many prayer requests this evening, Lord Jesus. Lord, you know each name. You know every hair and every head. You know the beginning from the end, oh Father God, and you're more than able, Lord, to reach out to the different prayer requests, Father, for the different families, for our loved ones, Lord, that are &gt;&gt; maybe gone astray, Lord Jesus, stepped back from the word of God.

It &gt;&gt; could have been so much worse, Father God. But &gt;&gt; thank you. &gt;&gt; Here he is at home, Lord. He's &gt;&gt; on the mend and I'm reaching out to you in the name of Jesus Christ that you just &gt;&gt; heal every broken bone in his body. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; His body, Lord Jesus. Give him healing, Lord, where his healing is needed. &gt;&gt; Wrap your arms of love around the entire family, Lord Jesus. Raise their faith, oh Father God, to go through this time. And Father, it's a long road to recovery. &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to commit the rest of the evening to you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We want to say, Lord, we just love you and worship you, Lord. &gt;&gt; May you just be with us the remainder of this week. Prepare the hearts for the coming service on the on the weekend, Lord Jesus. Grant each one travel and mercies back to their homes, oh Father God.
