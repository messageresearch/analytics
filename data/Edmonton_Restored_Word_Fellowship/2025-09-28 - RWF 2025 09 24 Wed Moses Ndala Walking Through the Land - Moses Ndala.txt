And even though unfortunately sometimes we have to take the lives of animals that we can live, it's just it it doesn't matter to them. They're they're there existing as God made them to exist.

Thank you, brother. Thank you for the atmosphere has been created. I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ this evening. How many are happy to be in the house of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Glory to his name. Good to have you this evening in a prayer meeting. We certainly enjoyed the services on Sunday. I personally enjoy them so so much. Amen. The just uh the I I think it it a mini revival for myself. Just so real to me. Those who couldn't attend for those services, I will encourage you to listen to them. For those who are married to listen to them and a couple again and it's just just wonderful, just good good services. I really enjoyed them tremendously and uh if you just have that right attitude I think it it it gives us a different perspective not just on the I'm taking it a little bit at a high level maybe not just yeah the couple families but also church but also uh also you know when when we were in Africa when we were growing up they used to say you You know a child in a village is not raised only by one family. A child in a village is raised by the whole village. So the same thing you know just not it's start of your family but put it and extend it to to others to the to just make it all family man. You know the younger mothers not the young mother the older mothers encourage the young one. the older brothers, encourage the the younger one. Just make it a big family. Amen. A church is a big family. I think that those principles we can apply it to each and every one of us. Just wonderful. Amen. &gt;&gt; Genesis 13. Then we go to the word of God. So turn to Genesis 13. Keep praying for sister Agnes like brother Andrew mentioned it. Um I didn't get any updates on that rather Shadrach communicated. Um but we keep them in prayer prayed with them on the phone as she was at the hospital there but and just continue praying for them. the trial the family is going through not only the family brother Shadrach but it's affecting the um sister Est sister Mameister Mameister u the older brother older sister of brother Shadrach so um and as the so the older nephew and all the others are just being affected so it's affecting the whole family just keep them prayer And naturally it affecting our church as well. So just keep them in prayer. Before we go to Genesis 13, let's just go bow our heads. Word of prayer. Father, we thank you to be again in the house the Lord this evening. Father in the evening time as it was in Genesis, Lord, as you could come in the evening time, have fellowship with Adam and Eve. Lord, we believe that as the word of God has been restored and that fellowship has been restored between the bride and you, Lord, we can have that fellowship in the evening time. Lord Jesus Christ, we invite you as has already been invited, but Father, we we welcome you. We won't tell you we love you. We appreciate you, Lord. We express our thanksgivings towards you for what you have done in our lives, what you continue to do, Lord. Father as we like to dedicate this moment a few moments Lord in your presence maybe one hour again remaining for the service father we just want to commit this one hour in your hands that you have the full preminence to hear the word but also father to speak to our heart but also when we speak that you will speak through our lips that you'll pray father through our heart that you will bear one another's burden Lord we can stand in big gap for others Lord for those who are here but also for those who could not make it for the great need Lord of Sister Agnes Lord as she's going through this trial Lord from almost nowhere nothing and now it's been declared the tumor Lord Lord may you intervene a special way God you heal by different ways but Lord you are the only healer &gt;&gt; may your father Lord touch her in a supernatural way as I thinking about it. Thought father lord of this third pool when the prophet could say before a doctor touch let it be removed father I believe that you are still the same god but whichever way you choose father that the same power of god will be working lord we love you and appreciate you we thank you for brother Andrew who's back among us lord thank you for keeping him safe thank you father for watching over him lord we missed him we thank you that we thank you that You brought him back among us safely, Lord. And you gave him, Father, Lord, something that he can, Lord, take as a game for for for the hunting trip that he went, Father. We thank you for that. Remember, Brother Victor, sister Davy, bless them, Father, as well, Lord, as we commit oursel to you. We love you and appreciate you. Remember brother remember brother Steve as we we say that we'll pray for him, Father. We pray for him. Pray for his ministry. We pray for his church. Pray for the upcoming trip that we go, Father, to Congo. Pray that you'll make it prosper. Father, we love you and appreciate you, Lord, in Jesus Christ name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have a problem with my songs. Brother Andre, is everything fine or did I all is good now or good? Um, I can hear myself. Can you hear me? Good. That's good. So, Genesis 13:14 17. That was not me. Can wake you up a little bit. Now there's Yeah, it's good. Yep. towards the end of my of the sermon. Do it again to wake people up. So, Genesis 13:14. Um, so the Bible says, "And the Lord said unto Abraham, after that Lot had was separated from him, lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou heart, northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward, For all the land which thy seest to thee will I give it, and to thy seed forever. And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered. Arise, walk through the land, in the length of it, and in the breadth of it, and I will give it unto thee." Then Abraham removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of memory which is in Abram and built there an altar unto the Lord. May God bless his word and inspiration give us the context of it. You can have a seat. Amen. The Bible as the Bible said unto Abraham after that Lot was separated from him. So this promise was given to Abraham only after there was a separation. I would like to talk a little bit for a few moment here before we go in prayer. I would like to talk about walking through the land. Ask Abraham arise and walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it for I will give it unto thee. Walk into the promised land. Amen. Walk into promised land. Abraham was given a a physical land. Abraham was given a physical land. And that physical land, people are still fighting about it. And around it, Israel is still fighting for it until now. Although it has been a promise to God, promise to Abraham from God that I will give you this land to you and to thy seed. Amen. Even though he gave him that land, they are still fighting for that land. Amen. But it's a promise that it belongs to them. The true Jew, a true Jew knows that that land belongs to him. It's not something to compromise about it. So something where we cannot maybe sometimes make people understand you know I feel sometimes sorry and I I I sometime sometime feel sorry for the people you know the United Nations because because they can't comprehend it from them they're looking international laws. So how can you just declare from out of the blue that a god wrote somewhere to you and this land belongs to you. Yeah. You can't make it understand it according to the international laws. You can't make them reason. You can make them have argument to base on it because the what applies to Israel, what applies to that land is not something you can argue about it intellectually. It's just God has given to them and you have to accept it and belongs to them and it's their property. You can't argue about it. &gt;&gt; Can't say but if you do this and then it double you do this but what about Russia? What about Russia can take that land and declare that Ukraine belongs to them? No, it's not the same role. Israel belongs. That land belongs to Israel because God said so. Amen. And God is the absolute. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And notice here that they say you have they have they he has a land. It was given to Abraham. But that blessing prophet say God blessed Abraham only after he was separated from Lot. Only after he was separated from his father when the father died. He he left the land where he was living and then but he took with him he took his father he took with him lot but they were not part of the promise but when they he was separated from them then God blessed him so in order for us to be blessed we have to be separated from unbelief we have to be separated from the domination of thought we have to be separated from the things of the past in order to be beneficiaries of God blessings amen that's just the role that's that part of the princip principle of the principles. Abraham received a physical land, we have a spiritual land. Amen. The same promise is given to us that we have a spiritual land and God has given us a spiritual land. The prophet will say in the invisible union of the bride of of Christ, it says Abraham was a pilgrim. The same for us, we are pilgrim. This world is not our world. We are going to a land. We're going to to to the final land. But before we go there, there is a land that God has promised us a spiritual land. God has separated us from all the dead religions. I'm speaking across the prophet says I'm speaking across the nation now all the dead creeds and to what he has separated us and open to us a new land a new message for this day and they will be thinking of that they say oh thank God you will be thank God this is thanksgiving message because we have a new land a new land the message that we have received is a new land the Holy Ghost is the promised land. Amen. That we have received. But remember that the one the promise given to Abraham, the promise was given to Abraham and Abraham Abraham made some some steps to get into the land. He had to leave the place. As I said at the beginning, he has to leave the place where he was and then he came into the land. But once he arrived in the land, it was just not it was not saying oh no. Now God did not tell him you know you're in the land and know just everything just uh just put your hands and now you know this land is yours. No. No. God told him, "No, Abraham, you have to walk in the land. You have to explore the land. You have to make sure you that you check every corner of the land. Oh, this one belongs to me. This one belongs to me." You have to go in the land and explore it. Amen. The same thing that we have received the message. We have to explore the message. We have to walk in the message. We have to explore the Holy Ghost. We have to walk in the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. unconditional covenant that the the prophet says I like that come out and look he's going to put a comment upon what we have read about Abraham says come out and look it look it over walk from the east to the west it's all yours you took your way with the Lord's despised few now you are heir to all of it he says amen all belongs to you now Abraham I give it to you unconditionally &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; I don't you don't deserve it But I give it to you anyhow. And the prophet says, "Amen." Oh, I don't deserve this, but he give it to me anyhow. &gt;&gt; You don't deserve it. I don't deserve it. But God by his grace has given that to us anyhow. Amen. &gt;&gt; He has given us the word of God anyhow, unconditionally because he predestinated us before the foundation of the world because he loved us. What is God's love? God love is elective love because he thought of us and he has given us his promise. Now we need to walk in his promise. Amen. &gt;&gt; Says I don't deserve it but I give it to me anyhow. So I'm going to walk east. I'm going to walk north. I'm going to walk west. I'm going to walk south and see what I own in the kingdom of God. All things are mine. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's get up and walk around. See how it looks. My it feels good. Take God by faith. That's why we are here in a prayer. We want to walk in God's promise. Amen. Not limit ourself to one just one portion. No, we want to walk in the whole land. You need healing, walk on it. Amen. You need salvation, walk on it. You need redemption, walk on it. You you you need joy of salvation, walk on it. Amen. You need peace, walk on it. You need salvation for your children, walk on it. You need work or job, walk on it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever you have need of your financial need, walk on it. &gt;&gt; How many times the prophet in the message will say, "Oh, you have maybe there is a financial need." Sometime we put financial need like on the side. Maybe you have financial need, walk in it. Amen. It's part of the promise. Amen. &gt;&gt; Doctor said I can't he can't get well. But God said I could. So I just taking that way and that's the way I believe it. Yes, sir. Well, no. Well, no. I I'm still sick as I was tonight. As I was tonight, it doesn't make any difference. Just makes me stronger. Believe be more of a miracle tomorrow night for me to get it. Prophet says, "Amen." &gt;&gt; That Abraham seed don't stagger at the promise of God. The doctor did all he could. That's all he could do. But God hasn't done all he can do. Any job that too big for God, I can't I can't I can't tackle it. So I just commit it to him and I go on. &gt;&gt; We desire to walk in God's land. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As we heard on Sunday, the promise of God and only only we should not only put them in the mythical and put it in the abstract world. No, we had to bring them down to the level where we are. Lord, I want the promise of God to be to be applied in my life. I want that's God desire connections. God desire fellowship with the bride. We also need connections with God. Amen. And also connection with one another. We need fellowship with one another. God make that real. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's walk on those promises as well. &gt;&gt; Connection. I like that word the way he was explaining. We need connection. &gt;&gt; My wife start looking at me in my eyes now from now on. It is good. I'm teasing her. Are you okay? Okay. Now I lost my arrows because &gt;&gt; need a connection. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I need a connection. So it says the prophet says in faith that what the matter with Christians that what the matter with people you don't know what you own you know if somebody gives you the Bible this blessed Bible here is your possession everything that God promising here is yours it belongs to you but maybe you say well the Lord saved me praise the Lord I'm glad for that I don't know about this divine didn't finish the sentiment but divine healing I don't know about these things Why could you buy a house without looking through it? If I own anything, I want to look around. Says, you know, the Holy Ghost is like a great big arcade. It's like a great big storehouse. Don't just limit to one corner. Go in that storehouse. If they say everything belongs to you, oh, go in that storehouse, you go, "Oh, I look, oh, this is nice. Oh, I need it. I take it." Amen. Oh, this is nice. I take it. Oh, I need this. Oh, this is nice. I take it. Amen. Don't limit God. Amen. Go in that big stock arcade and take everything you have need of. That's why we are coming to the primary. &gt;&gt; We're not coming here to beg. We are coming here to take what God has already given us. Every redemptive blessing of God is already purchased. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even the resurrection is already purchased. Even the rapture is already purchased. Amen. Nothing is impossible. Everything is a it's a past tense. Amen. We have to live in it now. We have to walk in it. Walk in it by faith. Like Abraham walked by faith. Abraham, do you want to tell me that as you are living that small tent there, this whole land belongs to you? Yes. How come? Because God said so. &gt;&gt; But you are still sick. You still don't have a child. But I know this land belongs to me. Not only to me, but to my seed too. Even the seed that I don't know, that I don't have yet, but this land belongs to them. &gt;&gt; Wow. The faith of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Prophet says, you know what an arcade is and you you are baptized into it. If if I own the arcade, I want to go on the shelf and see what I own. Look around, look at this. If something seems to be a little high or get me a ladder, climb up to it, look around and what belongs to me. What that ladder is Jacob's ladder. The prophet will clarify it and and qualify it at some another point. Say that ladder of Jacob is prayer. You think that something is very high. I I I can't reach that. I know it belongs to me, but I can't reach that. Then use Jacob's ladder. Because the the the lower you go, the higher you are going. The more you humble yourself, the more you higher you get to that place. Amen. The more you pray, the more you get that place where you think that very high. I can't access it. I I don't have enough faith to get there. Oh, stay in the word of God. Walk in the promises of God. Walk in the land. Amen. It's already yours. Walk in it. Amen. And go in prayer. And then you'll reach what is behind them. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Says that's the way he ought to do as a Christian. Look through the Bible. See what the promise is. Every one of them is to the believer. Amen. Remember when we used to sing the songs before we back every promise in the book is mine. Every chapter, every verse, every line I'm trusting in his love divine. Every promise in the book is mine. That's right. Yes. It's yours. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to other God. So that's what we are here. We have to walk into the land, &gt;&gt; the promised land. Amen. The message says, "Then when we did, Abraham took the poor and barren land. And when God appeared to him, he said, Abraham, stand up. Look at the east. Look at the west. look north and south said every bit of it I'll give it to you. Now Abraham I want you to walk through it. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know Abraham what was given to him it was a poor and barren land. Israel was the one of the poorest and barest if the word exist most barren land a desert completely a desert that's why that's why Lot when he looked he looked Sodom and Gomorrah and look what Abraham is said no no you know what I'm going to go in the valley there cuz said Abraham has nothing here it's just a barren land there's nothing here I'm going to go over there. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Maybe in your situation where you are in you look God says just walk in the land walk the land of of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It might look like barren. There is nothing nothing productive. Nothing is working. But that way God ask you to walk in. I don't see I don't I don't see how I can be prosperous in the place where I am. You know I'm there. Yeah man, let's put it in our level maybe know small church and I think and sometimes struggling to have a a a pianist sometime here. Can we put our level a little bit you know here and then all the negative things &gt;&gt; just walk in that. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm put a bit personal know sometimes you have we have sometimes the impression that I'm hesitating to say that okay since I'm meditating let me just put it aside but don't belittle yourself &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; you know don't look at the negative things don't look at the how small we are you know no we are the great nation of God amen we are like Israel small in number but great with God amen Praise be to God. Glory to God that &gt;&gt; glory to God. You know sometimes big churches can have the imp you know big church can have that impression. You know just come to our church you know there's nothing to youh just close it and come to our church. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. Why? Okay. Because you're a small number. Huh? Okay. So your reasoning is because we are small number we can just close the church and then just come and move any church. &gt;&gt; This is a sovereign local church.

Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a misconception people. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I hesitate a bit to say that but it's kind of bothered me a little bit just because talking to people no just just close your church &gt;&gt; you know this is complete sovereign church &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; you know that one time I made the mistake I clos not I made the mistake but it was in my heart I made the mistake I still say I made a mistake but I closed the church on a Sunday morning and I had a friend that I given a an appointment to come to the church he missed with this the Sunday before and the Sunday where I closed the church Sunday that's the Sunday came &gt;&gt; oh my &gt;&gt; came my door there's no one and he texted me &gt;&gt; I was like oh no one soul is more than 10 worlds &gt;&gt; should have been a church &gt;&gt; that's why a lot were thinking ah no I will go there Israel, land of Israel was widely desan if this is but God gave them a promise. Ezekiel 36 said the desolate land shall be tilled whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by. Everybody that passed by is all just a desolate land. The the the British no this is there's nothing. Why are we even fighting in this Palestine? There's nothing here. Let's move on. There's nothing here. Why? Why? Why? We were getting killed. No, let's leave it. But the Jew, the real Jew knew that this promise is going to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; So they shall say this land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; It's a promise. Ezekiel 36:34. But today is a reality. &gt;&gt; It's one of the most pro prosperous land Israel. They they call it a miracle. How can this desert now blossoming becomes the more effective and most most economically very rich country? They can't understand it. And technically they says he has more startup per capita than any almost any other country. It's a agricultural miracle from a desert from the place where they have they've increased in in a drip irrigation the salination agre techchnique they have water independence from a desert &gt;&gt; despite a dry climate they have water independence strong economy greening land &gt;&gt; wow &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; why because God's promise &gt;&gt; it's a land of prosperity for the natural Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the natural Israel cannot be blessed outside of that land. Amen. &gt;&gt; If God can bless Israel, the natural, how much more the spiritual Israel, the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; if you stay in the land of the Holy Ghost, if you stay in the land of the message of the hour, God will bless you. Amen. God will provide you all your need from that wilderness you are walking in, God will make it to bloom. Amen. It's God's promise. Amen. Walk in that land. Amen. Even though you don't see it yet, God will make it blossom. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You will put a little bit of work here, a little encourage you as we heard on Sunday, there is a little bit of practical things that you might do a little bit. Amen. That Israel in the natural, they do some practical things and God multiply it. Amen. They put a little bit of water irrigation here. Let's try this here. And then God multiplies, flourishes. The same thing in the spiritual. God has you know spend time with children, have altar, have a connection, have a lot a family altar. Small things you do, God multiplied. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Moses sent the spies. Moses sent the spies to do the same thing. He says, "Search the land." Says, "The Lord spoke unto Moses." Numbers 13, and saying, "Send thou men that they may search the land of Canaan, which I given unto the church, the children of Israel. For every tribe of their fathers shall send a man, everyone a ruler among them." The search actually didn't give up into the eyes of word and get up in the mountain. See the land what it is. And the people he didn't ask them to see if they will be able to possess it or not. He asked them to search the land to explore the land to look how extended it is what the promises. I told I told him they were see how it is. And indeed when they went there oh it is indeed a country a land where it flourishes where the milk is flowing and everything honey is all the promises of God. Amen. But then it says, you know, we saw also the giant. We didn't ask you to go and describe the giant. Yeah, you can describe the giant. But the promise don't let the the way you're describing it to reduce the faith of the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no. Yeah. God gives you a promise in the land of in the land of the Holy Ghost. You know that in the land of the Holy Ghost is not the millennium. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; That's right. the hand of the Holy Ghost or the promised land for us is not the millennium because in the promised land they still had to fight. They still had to fight. There were wars and different things. Brother Bam says in that land there were even frustration. &gt;&gt; You can be born again. You still have some frustration. Don't be discouraged. Don't say oh no I have giant in this land. Keep walking in it. &gt;&gt; Keep claiming God's promises. Keep walking in it. It's still mine. It's still mine despite the giant. It's still mine despite the frustration. It's still mine despite the fighting. It's still mine. Actually, I will fight for every inch of this land. I will fight for it. I will claim each and every one of it. Amen. Because it's my promise. In Joshua, he says, "Now Joshua, now after the death of Moses, servant of the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord spoke unto Joshua the son of Nun. Moses minister, saying, Moses, my servant is dead. Now therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, thou and all thy people, unto the land which I I do give to them, and even to the children of Israel. Every place that the soul of your foot shall dread upon, that have I given unto you." And I say on as I said unto Moses. So the first thing first thing now you have to arise and go over Jordan. So there is an action you have to do. Arise and go onto Jordan. &gt;&gt; Faith is action. Amen. Faith is not only abstract. Faith had to produce action. &gt;&gt; You believe and then you act. You believe then you speak. Amen. That what faith has to do. The second thing says every place that the soul of your foot shall tread. &gt;&gt; So you are in the land here. If you look at there the soul of your foot in go there that it belongs to you but it's not yours yet. &gt;&gt; You have to make an effort to go there and put the soul of your foot &gt;&gt; and then foot footprint it becomes your possession. &gt;&gt; Footstep is your possession. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we are going to do. So you have to walk in the land. You walk in every promise of God. You say, "God, this promise belongs to me because I'm putting the soul of my foot there. I want my healing. The healing belongs to me. I want the salvation of my children. It belongs to me." Amen. &gt;&gt; I want a life of of dedication of prayer. It belongs to me. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be destroyed for so many things. I become destroyed by the news and the different things to take my time. Oh Lord, I'm struggling with time to give to you. But now I come to claim that it belongs to me. Lord, I want to serve you in a greater way. Father, &gt;&gt; put your foot upon that promise. Claim it and confess to God and Lord, I'm struggling with this, but I'm putting my foot upon it and I'm claiming it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because it belongs to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. We can call the musicians. That's the end of the service. Amen. I have my 30 minute that's all prophet says now I put you on the basis of Luther on the same basis of Luther because you see sin was not known then like it is now but when we got more knowledge when we got more knowledge now than we Then when the enemy comes in like a flood, the spirit of God raises a standard against it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now today we have got more knowledge, more understanding. So the rivers of unbelief is flowing in heart but God raises a standard against it. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the enemy will come, oh there will be some wars in that land. But God will raise the standard &gt;&gt; against it. Praise be to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just a closer walk with thee.
