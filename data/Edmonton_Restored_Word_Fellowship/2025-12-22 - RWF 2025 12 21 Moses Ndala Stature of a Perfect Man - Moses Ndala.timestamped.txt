[24:54] to say. Wasn't that love? Oh, wasn't that love?
[25:06] As he laid there in the tomb, he did what he came to do. Wasn't that love?
[25:20] Wasn't that love?
[25:26] But he rose up from the dead so that we could live today. Wasn't that love? Oh,
[25:40] wasn't that love? Oh, wasn't that love?
[25:51] as he left his home about to die on Calary

[35:23] turn already to second Peter no 1 Timothy 3:16. Turn in your Bible. Just want a few comments here.
[35:38] Looks like it has been a long time since the Wednesday service was cancelled because of the
[35:42] weather and just apologize for those who didn't have the announcement on time. Um
[35:50] there is a there is a WhatsApp group for the church there where we put announcement. So if
[35:55] you are not in that WhatsApp group, please express it to one of us and then we add it
[36:03] to you so that it's easier to communicate there. We can especially in winter and things like that

[36:26] but there is a main one where I put announcement. be good to be part at least one group then you
[36:32] can get the announcement and then just want to thank God for what God has done brother Wesley

[36:48] accident but God spared their lives thank God for that give him the glory and the honor and
[36:55] he put the good testimony said God was there God was stronger than than the death angel was
[37:02] trying to take the light there. We thank God for what he has done. The glory in the keep
[37:08] praying for many families to be traveling during this time. Brother Philip and his
[37:14] family will go to Portugal and brother Z will be senator will be going to BC and family there.
[37:23] Peter is already gone and brother Godfrey will be going as well this week. People are leaving me
[37:35] but uh just want to pray for them and keep them watch over them. So God bless you. It's
[37:40] good to see and family it's good to see you back. richly traveled as well and my dear wife is not
[37:52] feeling well today. Let's keep her in prayer. So I took this Sunday school this morning something
[38:05] was good. So um it's called first there
[38:24] verse 16.
[38:31] Very familiar scripture and
[38:40] says let's start from verse 15 but if I t long that thou mayest know how thou ordest to behave
[38:47] thyself in the house of God which is the church of the living God the pillar and ground of the
[38:54] truth you see how the continuity and 16 says and and is a conjunction mean what he's talking about
[39:03] he's putting emphas Behave thyself in the house of God which is the church of the living God,
[39:10] the pillar and ground of the truth and without controversy. Great is the mystery of godliness.
[39:17] It's what I'll be talking about today. Great is the mystery of godliness. God was manifest
[39:24] in the flesh flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles,
[39:32] believed on in the world, and received up into glory. May God bless his word and have it. Amen.
[39:49] Certainly blessed last Sunday service brother Victor took morning and service in the evening
[39:55] communion. Thank God for his presence and continuity of the Holy Spirit. I would like
[40:03] to continue today on the statue of a perfect man book but I would like to take it a little bit
[40:09] in conjunction with Christmas although we don't celebrate Christmas like the world celebrate it
[40:17] so in that I would like to read in second Peter chapter 1 verse 3-7 I'll be talking about the
[40:25] mystery of godliness according as his divine power is given unto us all things that pertain unto life
[40:35] and godliness through the knowledge of him. So everything that he has given us pertain to life
[40:43] and godliness through the knowledge of him that they had called us to glory and virtue whereby
[40:49] I given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers
[40:56] of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this
[41:04] giving all diligence at your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance
[41:09] temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly
[41:16] kindness and to brotherly kindness charity. Amen. So godliness is a part of it's part of the virtue
[41:26] a part of the attributes of what needs to have in order to have the statue of a perfect man. Amen.
[41:35] I would say godliness is not only a virtue but the Bible says there is a mystery about godliness. So
[41:43] it's not only a simple virtue or simple quality or we can say I think it's more than that more than
[41:49] that I think it's godliness is a is a character is a is a is a nature of god himself. Amen. The
[41:58] unveiling of the mystery of godliness is god being manifested in the flesh. This was done in the
[42:03] ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ when he came the first time. It was the expression of expression of
[42:10] God himself. Jesus Christ is not another person of the deity as we know that Jesus Christ is God
[42:16] himself. Is the person of the deity of God himself is not a person is not just a portion of second
[42:24] part but it is God himself the only and true God. As we know Jesus was not born in December. Just
[42:31] repeating that to children and they all know it. I was just surprised and they all know Jesus was not
[42:36] born in December. He was born was he's a sheep. He can't be born in December. Oh, you're very well
[42:43] instructed. That's very good. So, but why do we celebrate in December? No, we don't. It's just a
[42:48] day that was put Roman Catholics try to remember that. But uh so we don't celebrate as the world
[42:55] celebrate. But still we we we we we acknowledge that the best gift that God has given us is God
[43:03] himself that he came as a son. So we acknowledge that and we just want to take that opportunity as
[43:09] well to express our thanksgivings to him. The prophet says the angel was at his birth how
[43:15] the angels might have looked down and rejoiced when they looked down on the manger and seen God
[43:20] incarnate. Amen. It won't it won't no wonder they begin in scream today in the city of David is born
[43:27] Christ the savior. Angels rejoiced and they swung their big wings together and over the hills of
[43:34] Judea they sang glory to God in the highest. Peace on earth and God and good will to man.
[43:40] They seen God's word and they watched over it to see it manifested. There it was. And Satan didn't
[43:47] believe that you know even though he saw the angel announcing him the angel believing and proclaiming
[43:53] that he was God but Satan did not believe that the angel said he is that's the difference if thou do
[43:59] so or let us see you do it but the angel said he's there no Satan was still doubting that he
[44:05] was the Messiah but the angel already announced it and if the believer could hear the word the
[44:10] shepherd heard the announcement they believed it that he was really Christ the Messiah. Amen. Satan
[44:16] is always there doubting the word of God and he will continue to be doubting the word of God even
[44:21] today. But as a Christian is to take what God says and believe what God says. The prophet says and it
[44:28] says and it was God manifest in the flesh one God. That one God was manifest in the flesh that ought
[44:34] to settle. God came in human form that didn't make him another God. He was God the same God. It was
[44:41] the same Elohim who was made flesh and dwell among us. So Jesus Christ is the is God. Amen.
[44:48] Jesus Christ in the flesh in the spirit in the in in in the soul. He was completely God. Amen. He
[44:55] was a God and a man at the same time. It was God taking the form of a man. The difference a great
[45:02] difference. You can't even compare the Lord Jesus Christ with brother Banam. It's impossible times.
[45:07] You can't compare the two that Jesus Christ is the God. He's He was God. He was born out of sin. He
[45:13] is God. Amen. Even it was God taking a form of a flesh. You can't put like brother Branam. He
[45:21] was born in sin and signal and he was saved. Amen. And God used his vessel. So that's completely two
[45:28] different things you can if you and incomparable. Brother Banam is not our savior. The Lord Jesus
[45:33] Christ is our savior. He's our redeemer. He's our healer. He's the first and the last. He's the God
[45:40] of gods. He's the prophet of the prophet. He's the alpha and the omega. He's the prince of peace.
[45:46] He's our all. He's our whole portion. The Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. But we thank God for giving
[45:53] us a prophet and we respect the prophet. But way beyond that, our love is towards the Lord Jesus
[45:59] Christ. Amen. Just to make it so clear, giving God. The prophet says, "What a most lovely story.
[46:07] I don't see how people could ever stay a sinner and know that how that God became one of us."
[46:13] It's so beautifully illustrated here. I would like to preach on it. Says in Ruth and Naomi,
[46:18] he was become the kinsman redeemer. He had to be a redeemer. He had to be king. How God in his spirit
[46:26] couldn't be king to us. And he became king to us when God made God God made man in his own image.
[46:34] He was a spirit man and there was no man to kill the soul. It's like like like in the garden of
[46:39] Eden there was he created the man after his own image with a spirit and then he created a body
[46:44] for Adam. But now God has to come in the body to be a kinsman redeemer to understand us to
[46:50] know what we are going through to feel our pain to feel when you have sickness to bear and to
[46:55] carry our burdens to carry our sins. He became us so that we can become him. He became sin became
[47:03] sin so that we can become the very righteousness of God himself. It was a great exchange and God
[47:09] comes to us so that we can become him. Amen. That was the great purpose of God. That's why he came.
[47:16] We can worship him during Christmas season by realizing the what he has done for us. How we
[47:23] saved our how he came to our place and took our status and our place. Amen. Amen. So great is
[47:29] the mystery of godness because he was manifest in such simplicity. God was God left glory. He came
[47:37] to our level. It was a such simplicity in the way that people didn't see any beauty in him. He was
[47:43] just a simple man. Even even even from this birth imagine the king of king was was born in a manger.
[47:50] He was born in a mansion, a place that is dirty, the place that you know is stinking and but that
[47:56] was the king of king born in that simplicity. Great is the mystery of your godness but in the
[48:02] such simplicity that God came in. Oh thank God for his grace in our life. Sometimes the way to
[48:10] find God is in the simple things in the humble things in the way he's expressing. You want to
[48:16] know Christ? Find him in humility. Find him in simplicity. God is the high. He's so big the He's
[48:23] so big that he can become so simple. Praise be to God. And you want to see God expressed, look at
[48:31] the life of Jesus Christ. You want to see God, you want to see how God will behave as a human being,
[48:37] look at the life of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the mystery of godliness unveiled. As the Bible
[48:44] says, he was he was the the the full Godhead was in one flesh in the Lord Jesus Christ. He
[48:49] was manifested in the flesh. God was manifested in the flesh. Justified in the spirit. Justified
[48:57] here doesn't mean that he sinned and then he was forgiven and justified. Justified mean he was he
[49:02] was he is declared is the righteous one. He's the one who has no sin. He's already declared
[49:08] he has no sin and no spot in no spot in him. is the very righteousness of God. So is the mystery
[49:15] of God unveiled? For the sake of time, I just want to draw a few characteristics of the life
[49:20] of Jesus Christ here. Jesus Christ had a Jesus Christ lived a life like a human being. You know,
[49:28] he he as a child, he grew up as a child. He was obedient to the parent and and followed
[49:35] the instruction of the parent. He drove even their parents to the word of God. He corrected
[49:40] them according to the word of God. The word of God always correct always brings back correction
[49:46] to the truth. Amen. So he was he but he was a obedient child. He lived the simple life and and
[49:53] then then he was a obedient parent, a carpenter. People were looking at him even when he came back
[49:58] to them people were astonished. How could you teach this such great things? He was just he's
[50:03] one of us. We know where he's born. We know he's we know his brothers. How how can he declare that
[50:09] he's the Messiah? Because he was just living a simple life like any other human being. Amen.
[50:15] Simple life of Jesus Christ. It was God manifested God being expressed the life of Jesus Christ. And
[50:23] then he was and and and as he was living there and and and when the time came for his manifestation,
[50:29] he just follow the word of God. It was simple. going to the temple every day and praying and
[50:35] declaring and preaching and healing the sick. The life of Jesus Christ, it was God living the life
[50:42] among us. Amen. Expressing himself, the godliness in simplicity. The Bible says the the Jesus Christ
[50:51] was is is is accustomed to to pray was accustomed to withdraw himself in the wilderness and prayed.
[50:58] Luke's 5:16. So Jesus Christ said that the life of prayer is a life that expressed expressed how is
[51:07] a representation of how we have to express God as well. Do you agree with me? If you look at
[51:13] the life of Jesus Christ, it is a representation of how we have to be. So godliness is to be like
[51:20] Jesus Christ. Godliness is to follow the example of Jesus Christ. Even in the time of Christmas,
[51:27] people have celebrate Christmas without Christ. Put Christ outside of side. But if you celebrate
[51:33] Christmas, but Christmas is about Jesus Christ. Is your life reflecting the life of Jesus Christ?
[51:40] That the question we should be asking ourselves. I think it's a time to to to to ponder a little
[51:46] bit on that as well. Amen. That God, am I really like Jesus Christ? Question mark. Amen.
[51:54] to be like Jesus. Am I really like Jesus Christ godliness? Am I really if the people see me can
[52:00] they say oh I see Jesus Christ walking in that brother in that sister and but that's what I
[52:05] desire to be to be more like Jesus Christ. Prophet says just previous chapter we find one place where
[52:12] the son of god spends so much time in prayer. If Jesus had to spend much time in prayer to stay in
[52:18] fellowship with the spirit that was in him, how much more do you and I have to spend in prayer?
[52:25] Much time in prayer. If you only knew what time in prayer meant. Sometimes when you are in prayer,
[52:31] God changes the complete destination of different things that going to happen. Prayer changes
[52:38] things. God in his own power, God is presenting the flesh in his own power. He had to depend on
[52:44] the power of prayer. Amen. Because he knew that prayer changes things. Sometimes we forget that
[52:52] we rap, we reason, we men things and we try things on our own effort. But do you how much
[52:57] do you spend time in prayer to express to to change the situations because God is waiting
[53:04] on you. God is waiting on me. They will ask the prophet but why why pray? God already know what
[53:09] is going to happen. Why does he need me to pray? Yes, God want to have participation with you. He
[53:16] want to take the glory by sharing that by sharing that participation with you. He knows that God God
[53:24] needs workers. He know that the field needs God workers there. But he says you pray for
[53:29] them. Amen. Pray that the escape doesn't come in winter. But God, can't you just do that so
[53:36] that it doesn't come in winter? But he asking you and I to pray or he asking the disciple
[53:40] that time pray so that it doesn't come in winter. God wants you and I to be in fellowship with him.
[53:51] Jesus Christ lived that life of godliness in meekness and he says I'm weak and lowly
[53:57] in heart. The prophet says in the statue of the perfect man that godliness when he was smitten on
[54:03] one side of the face he turned the other. when he was spoken raft to he didn't speak he didn't ride
[54:10] back that godliness godliness is Jesus Christ was meek and lonely I would say this if you have any
[54:17] other revelation we have any other attitude that does not produce the humility you need to check
[54:23] it again anything should produce a humility and a simplicity a life of a Christian is a simple life
[54:31] is a humble life is not a life of boasting It's not life of pride. It's not a life of arrogance.
[54:38] It's a life of humility. As Jesus Christ was a humble man, he was meek and lowly in heart. He
[54:45] he he was not walking to boast himself. He was not trying to present himself even to witness
[54:50] about himself. Said the the father bear witness of what I'm doing. I can't do anything unless I see
[54:57] the father do first. He was giving all the glory to the father. Whatever you can do as a Christian
[55:03] life is not about you. is about God. Let God take all the glory. Amen. We have nothing to do about
[55:10] it. It's about God and God himself. If he chooses you, if he chooses me to do something, just be
[55:16] willing to do it. But all the glory goes to God. Amen. That's Jesus Christ expressed him in his
[55:22] own life. The Bible says, "Walk worthy with all loneliness and meekness. God resisted the pride
[55:28] and and and give grace unto the humble." Jesus Christ is life as his life was the life about
[55:35] not is not about his own will but the father's will as you will say not my will by dying be
[55:42] done as you talk to God and this is one the key I think this is one the key of godliness if you want
[55:48] to remember something that you can remember to be like Jesus but this is just one key I think of the
[55:53] prophet has put it here in the statue of perfect man says godly always looking for one thing
[55:59] I always do what I Always do that which pleases the father. Amen. See? Yes sir. That's godliness.
[56:08] Godliness as one key is that was the end of the quote there. But I'm saying godliness is one as
[56:14] one key is looking for one thing. Is it pleasing the father because Jesus was always doing what's
[56:22] pleasing the father? is my life is what I'm doing is the decision I'm taking is it anything I'm
[56:29] doing is it pleasing the father oh god if you can always have that attitude that will change many
[56:36] things what I'm doing or the decision I'm making is it pleasing the word of god is it pleasing
[56:42] the father not pleasing me not pleasing someone else not pleasing my neighbor not pleasing to my
[56:48] parents not pleasing my wife not pleasing my my my husband but is it first pleasing God Amen. Is
[56:54] what I'm doing pleasing the father? That what the attitude of Jesus Christ. Jesus said in John 8:29,
[57:01] "And he that sent me is with me. The father has not left me alone. For I do always those
[57:07] things that please him." Jesus life was entirely oriented towards pleasing the father. His motive,
[57:15] his words, his action flowed through that single focus. Am I pleasing the father? This I think this
[57:22] scripture describe the perfect godness in Christ Jesus because he was sinless. He could say truly
[57:28] I always do what pleases the father. Yes. As a human being sometimes we make mistakes sometimes
[57:34] and things like this and the things that we do don't necessarily please god sometimes. Do
[57:39] you agree with me? Do things and and we are sorry about it and we repent about it. But the deepest
[57:46] desire in our heart as the brother sang I just it was for me it was just a keynote as I think oh
[57:52] looks my message looks like it's negative but when I got that keynote as I thank God I think I'm in
[57:58] the right channel now my but your greatest desire has to be God I want to please you it has to be I
[58:07] want to I want to satisfy you I want to please you in my flesh I will make mistakes and we all make
[58:12] mistakes we die daily and all different But the inner side, the inner motive, the inner thing has
[58:18] to be Lord I want to please you. Brother Bana made a lot of mistakes. Abraham made a lot of mistakes.
[58:24] But the deepest desire that was inside of him was I want to please you. I want to I I want to
[58:31] do what your word says. Lord, I I want to find out what you want me to do. I I want to read the word
[58:38] of God. Not not not not just to learn myself or to learn but I want to learn what pleasing you.
[58:47] I want to satisfy you. I want to obey your word. I I want to align myself with the word of God.
[58:53] Amen. That's the desire of a Christians. That's the characteristics of godliness. Always looking
[59:01] for one thing. I always do that which pleases the father. says, "So it's a directions. You know that
[59:08] you can't please God without faith." So you pray, "Lord, give me more of your revelation. Give me
[59:15] more of faith, Lord." Is that your desire this morning? God, give me more faith. Give me more
[59:20] revelation. Help me to see you the things the way you see it, not the way I see it, because I desire
[59:26] to please you. You are, you are going in a certain way. You want to grow. Your desire is to grow.
[59:32] The way to grow is to read the Bible and to pray every day. So that's your desire. Lord,
[59:37] I want to grow. I want to become mature. I want to be a strong Christians. I don't want to be a
[59:43] stagnant Christians. I want to be just rely on my past. And oh no, no. I was save I was
[59:47] saved 20 years ago, 30 years ago. And you know, I used to be a Christian back then. But no, Lord,
[59:52] I want every day I want a closer walk with you. Every day I want to grow. Every day I want to
[59:57] I want to be pleasing to you. pleasing to you in everything that I do, in my thought, in my the way
[1:00:03] I speak. I want to reflect you, Lord. I want to be like Jesus. Amen. In my relationship with my wife,
[1:00:11] my relationship with my husband, my relationship with my children, my relationship at work,
[1:00:15] my every everywhere I am, I want to be pleasing to God, to be like Jesus Christ. Right. Paul will say
[1:00:23] in Colossians Colossians 1:10 that you might walk worthy of the law then unto all pleasing
[1:00:30] being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God. 1 Thessalonians 4:1 says,
[1:00:36] "Furthermore, that we beseech you, brethren, and exalt you by the Lord Jesus Christ that as
[1:00:40] you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you will abound more and more."
[1:00:50] That was the desire of Paul that people desire to walk and please God. And that's what I want
[1:00:57] for the church as well. I want for myself, Lord. I want to please you. Pleasing, pleasing. Everything
[1:01:03] I do, everything I say, I desire to be pleasing to you, Lord. That's my desire. Present your body as
[1:01:10] a living sacrifice in order to please God. And the Bible says, "If you love me, keep my commandment."
[1:01:17] Your desire is to keep God's commandment. Lord, I want I I want to keep your commandment. I want to
[1:01:23] love you. I want to obey you in everything that your prophet says. Not to dilute it, not to put
[1:01:28] it and know this was only for his time or it was a cultural background or different. No father,
[1:01:34] I want to take all the word of God and to accept it and to live it by it. That should be the desire
[1:01:40] for Christians. Young people, your desires to be Lord. I want to serve you. Oh. The way I want to
[1:01:48] approach marriage, I want to approach it in a way that is pleasing to you. The way I want to Oh,
[1:01:59] make me give me that desire to please you in everything. Not to dilute thing,
[1:02:04] not to diminish things, not to find the cuts. People are looking for shortcut in everything. All
[1:02:09] right. But you know this is I can find a shortcut. No, that's not the right attitude. But Lord,
[1:02:15] let me help me to accept the whole word of God and to believe it and to live by it. Sometimes
[1:02:22] we take them I don't want to be negative but are you with me this man I don't want to lose but I
[1:02:29] want just to put that desire know it has to be to pleasing God some say no there is always a
[1:02:34] justification for everything this but you know brotherham says alo the other things and you
[1:02:39] want to justify everything. No, I don't want to be a justifier of everything, but Lord, let me
[1:02:46] to be obedient to your word. The way it say my heart, make me sensitive to things of God. Amen.
[1:02:57] Godliness means choosing God's will above self as Jesus did. You have the Bible. What does the Bible
[1:03:04] say? Now, now that we have the prophet, what does the prophet say about this? Godliness is
[1:03:10] looking to please God. I read somewhere it was said, godliness is living with the certain of
[1:03:17] pre certain aim of pre of pleasing the father as Jesus did perfectly as believers pursue sometimes
[1:03:24] imperfectly but sincerely through Christ. So then in godliness consider Christ as the standard. So
[1:03:32] Christ is the standard. is a typos is the absolute is the reference is one you have to look up to
[1:03:38] everybody has to look to Christ and Christ is the word of God and you have to find a way to
[1:03:45] get there is by grace it's not not necessarily by own by own efforts it's not by your it's not
[1:03:50] by your works but it's by grace but it remains the standard Lord give me the grace to come to
[1:03:56] that standard give me the grace to reflect that standard grace is not no this is a standard I
[1:04:03] can leave whatever I can want to do here and the standard is far away from me here and I'm okay
[1:04:08] god is look at me and god accept the way I is no no no and no grace is lord help me father to get
[1:04:17] to that standard I'm failing but I want to get to that standard I want to reflect Christ in the
[1:04:23] youth in the old in the marriage in the adults in the elders and everyone from the pastor to
[1:04:30] the last one Christ is the standard Amen. And then you desire Lord I want to grow. Let me be
[1:04:39] expecting to grow and I desire to grow. Never stay a standard. Amen. Jesus holiness was shown by what
[1:04:46] he says. Which of you can convince me of sin. We know that sin is unbelief. Stealing is not
[1:04:55] sin. Telling lies is not sin. Swearing and all the other things are not sin. Sin is unbelief.
[1:05:02] If you believe, really believe, the Holy Spirit will accept you and you'll be sealed with the
[1:05:07] Holy Ghost. So the question is, have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed? Because sin is
[1:05:14] unbelief. Sin is unbelief. But if you believe, you have to come to the new birth of the baptism
[1:05:21] of the Holy Ghost. The Bible also say be holy for I am holy. Now the scripture says you're holy. But
[1:05:28] there are always two aspect to the scriptures. Are you with me? this in this this morning there are
[1:05:33] two aspect of the scriptures the prophet will say he says regarding to the scripture says
[1:05:38] be holy for I am holy now you cannot be holy I'm not depending on my own holiness I have none I'm
[1:05:46] depending on his holiness it is his holiness that I'm looking at you can't create holiness
[1:05:53] in yourself holiness is god who gives us holiness can't be holy by yourself it's god who's holy that
[1:06:00] is even go further I can't say it's a holy church. No, it's the holy God in that church. Can't say a
[1:06:05] holy mountain is a god because the holy god was on that mountain. Can't say anything that the
[1:06:11] holy the holy Christian. No, it's because Christ is leaving that person and becomes holy. Amen. So
[1:06:17] the holiness was about your work. The holiness is about God's God's being inside of you. So that is
[1:06:24] holiness that I'm looking at. Not that well but not that what I was but what what he is that it
[1:06:31] go back in the beginning there is Jesus Christ the same yesterday and then finish the sentence.
[1:06:37] So holiness is about not depending on my holiness but is depending upon his holiness but he remains
[1:06:43] the standard Lord keep me to that bring me to that standard bring me to that reference I desire to
[1:06:50] be like that reference Lord then prophet we going sometimes take the other side says you know he has
[1:06:57] a be holy and he says now you have to be you have to quit living in sin they would go say no so he's
[1:07:04] a reference so quit what you are doing. If there's something you can quit, quit it so that you you
[1:07:09] can get closer to God. The grace of God will bring you closer to God. And I did a little bit I want
[1:07:15] to put just a parentheses here. This is the major sin. The prophet says, "How can I overcome?" This
[1:07:20] is the major sin in our days. If you read the statue of perfect man is also elaborating a
[1:07:26] little bit of that. This is the major sin of our days. It's a major sin among our people.
[1:07:31] It is worldliness. as the Bible says Leodyian age was. She's worldly, rich, have need of nothing.
[1:07:39] Don't know that she's naked, miserable, wretched, and blind. That the sin of our day. When you hear
[1:07:46] the word of God call out against it, then you take the other route, you are unpopular with the world.
[1:07:52] For sure in our days, if you it even becomes hard to express our own opinions. Sometimes at work,
[1:07:58] you can because they will see like, oh, I mean, which which century are we living in? This is
[1:08:03] 21st century. Are you still in 19? They the thing that evolving. But the word of God doesn't change.
[1:08:10] God doesn't change. He absolutely stays the same. Amen. If it was back then it was wrong. It's still
[1:08:15] wrong today. The word of God does not change. We ask to change and come to the word of God one more
[1:08:21] time. Amen. Says that's the sin of our day. When you hear the word of God call then you take the
[1:08:27] other side. You unpopular with the world. You are tempting to go back. I know you keep saying to me,
[1:08:32] I know you are saying all the time. I know you get tired of me hopping on these things. I get
[1:08:38] tired seeing you doing it too. So, no, you always repeat the same thing. You always look like you
[1:08:45] are harsh on the woman and I but why I know you are tired of hearing me saying those things. I'm
[1:08:50] tired to see those things again happening. Yeah, sometimes it can also go back into the church
[1:08:56] these things coming back into the church. But it is the role of the of the preachers to come. No,
[1:09:01] don't stay in line. Stay in line. You are being called to stay in line with the word of God. You
[1:09:07] are being called to stay in the standard of the word of God. Amen. So, and we have to say amen.
[1:09:12] Amen. Amen. Because we don't want worldliness to come in our lives. We don't want worldliness to
[1:09:19] come in our families. No, no, no. We stand there and say we don't want worldliness in here. He's a
[1:09:24] holy house. He's a holy temple of God. We want the pure holiness of God here. We don't want to stand
[1:09:31] for the worldliness of the world. No. The father has to be strict. No. I don't want these things in
[1:09:36] my family. I don't want these things in my house. No, no, no, no, no. Has to be strong husband,
[1:09:42] strong fathers. No, no, no. I don't want these things in my Amen. No, no, no. Become quiet. No.
[1:09:49] This is a new world. Just be just be polite. Just be tolerant. You you have to be weak and humble.
[1:09:56] Yes. But that's not against the word of God. Stay with the word of God, but in humility. Amen. Amen.
[1:10:08] I'm getting tired of you do it, too. That's right. That sin that I'm trying to tell you about. What
[1:10:14] are you harping on it for? Stop doing it then. I'm trying to save your life by the word. I get tired
[1:10:20] also. Just straighten up. That sin shouldn't do be done. the prophet speaking. Thank God for the
[1:10:27] prophet. Thank God for the man of God who didn't compromise on the word of God. We would have been
[1:10:32] like Sodom and Gomorrah if he had compromised on the word of God. We would have been like
[1:10:37] denominations that have no standard. If we had compromised upon the word of God, would have
[1:10:42] been like that other people that trying to please everybody, pleasing everybody. No, just please
[1:10:49] we are all together. Just think no, no, no, no, no, no, no. God calls for total separation from
[1:10:55] unbelief. Total separation from the world. You have to be stuck to God to the word of God. Amen.
[1:11:08] Titus 2:12 says, "Denying ungodliness and worldly lust." God godliness reflect moral purity.
[1:11:18] Yes, it's not perfection by human strength, but at the same time, it has to reflect moral
[1:11:23] purity and powered by God himself. If you preach against worldliness, people call you legalist.
[1:11:34] So, no, you are too you're on the law. That's not you know the message not about the law. It's
[1:11:39] grace. Grace. No. Yes. But grace doesn't mean you have everything. just crapping in and and
[1:11:46] then things and people start cutting their hairs. Women start cutting their hairs, coloring their
[1:11:52] hairs green. And sister, why do you can't you think really the Holy Spirit will put green hair?
[1:11:57] Really? Right. Jesus Christ. Really? The spirit that was in the Lord Jesus Christ would have green
[1:12:06] hair? No. No. Look, look, look, look, look how you are behaving. Look, look. We are the way dressing.
[1:12:14] Look at the things you are watching. Is that the spirit of Jesus Christ? No, no, no, no. So,
[1:12:20] straighten up. We are tired of those things. I'm tired of those things. We should be tired of
[1:12:26] those things. Lord, I want to please you, Lord. My desire is to please you, to walk with you, Lord.
[1:12:32] I want to accept the whole word of God. I hope it's not too hard. Amen. Just the word of God.
[1:12:45] But the prophet many places says you know I want to be Calvinist where the Calvinist
[1:12:52] is staying with the Bible. I want to be Armenian or Armenianism when staying with
[1:12:57] the Bible. So all together amen born again but you grow until the stature
[1:13:03] of perfect man. We desire to grow. Amen. We can't stay babies. We desire to grow.
[1:13:10] Praise be to God. We desire to be pleasing to God. Let me say this. Continual sanctification is part
[1:13:17] of godliness. Remember the key note. Lord, what is pleasing to you? They always ask you a question.
[1:13:24] Do you think that the spirit of Christ will put on the things that you are putting on? So stay with
[1:13:30] the word of God. The proverb say of the perfect man. No. What he what if we got down to Bible
[1:13:37] doctrine of wearing shorts and and bobbing hair and stuff like that. You see where to godliness
[1:13:43] women professing godliness and holiness in the parties and everything else. Tattlers blabbers
[1:13:50] not having been able to hold their own tongue tongue talking and tattling and going around. And
[1:13:59] what about the men? They have parties and gold golf games and they're half-dressed little old
[1:14:07] dirty looking clothes on with them women hanging out there. No wonder prophet speak and it's true
[1:14:18] some sisters church Sunday long dress
[1:14:25] but go see them at home pants.
[1:14:33] Watch out now.
[1:14:37] So Lord, am I pleasing you or am I pleasing the people? I want to
[1:14:42] please you, Lord. My desire is to please you.
[1:14:55] But we are separate people. Prophet says God's church and his people have always been a separate
[1:15:01] people, a called out people, a peculiar people, a holy nation, a royal priesthood, offering
[1:15:07] spiritual sacrifices to God, the fruits of their lips, giving praise to his name. God called his
[1:15:13] church and separated from the world for that very purpose and give it a law and he must be holy. He
[1:15:19] said, "I'm holy and you must be holy and without holiness no man can no man shall see the Lord."
[1:15:26] God said that himself and he had called his people to be his type of his people and they forgotten
[1:15:31] about it. They forgotten his laws. They had forgotten their morals. Talking about the Israel,
[1:15:36] they forgotten the moral. Israel woman out there each one expecting to be conceived by the Holy
[1:15:41] Spirit to bring forth the Messiah and then acting like that. The characters was terrible. I want to
[1:15:46] stop here a minute to say it's the same thing among our people today that call themselves
[1:15:51] Christians. the character if I would if they would only realize the first coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:15:57] Christ. They forgot the morals. They have to be each one should be expecting to receive the son,
[1:16:03] the Messiah by the Holy Ghost. But they lost their morals. The second coming now is the Lord be born
[1:16:09] in the manger of my heart. In this Christmas, I want Christ to be born in the manger of my
[1:16:14] heart. If he's not there yet, but if he's there, Lord, let Christ grow. I want you to grow further.
[1:16:19] I want to become m I want to become mature Christians. I don't want to stay baby. Lord,
[1:16:24] help me to identify what is pleasing you and that's what I want desire to do. Amen. Attribute
[1:16:31] of of maturity. Sometimes as he's talking about character, I want to put a comment. Character
[1:16:37] means growing. Character is is is something that will bring you into adoption. The birth does not
[1:16:43] bring you into adoption. It's your character that brings you into adoption. You are born a
[1:16:49] son of God. You are born a daughter of God. But it doesn't bring you automatically to adoption.
[1:16:54] It needs a character. And character is a victory. Character means you have a collaboration with God.
[1:17:02] For Christ to come and be and and be adopted. It has to reflect the character of Christ. Is
[1:17:08] character of God. He spoke like God. He has the mind of God. The same thing for us. the decisions
[1:17:14] you make, you the the the things the way you speak, it has to be reflecting Christ. Then he can
[1:17:21] adopt you and then he can say this is my son who came to maturity. Amen. It doesn't remove you from
[1:17:27] being a son, but you in order for him to adopt you, you have to express Christ character. Lord,
[1:17:33] help me to express your character. Lord, shape me, mold me, do whatever it takes. If it's by the word
[1:17:40] of God, shape me. If by certain trials, Lord, if it's the perfect will, I want to do your perfect
[1:17:45] will, Father because I want to reflect you in all things. Attribute of maturity is also forgiveness.
[1:17:57] Jesus said, "Father, forgive them."
[1:18:01] The Bible says, "Forgiving one another in Ephesians 4:32, forgiving one another even as
[1:18:07] God for Christ's sake has forgiven you. Godliness is forgiving love even when you have been wronged.
[1:18:16] But I believe we still don't have the real the real grasp of that scripture forgiving one another
[1:18:24] even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you. Amen. I I sometimes I ponder about it and I say,
[1:18:32] "Lord, am I really having the revelation of what it means here? The way Christ forgave me, the way
[1:18:40] he has forgiven me, can I forgive my brother the same way." Amen. Sometimes we we want quickly I
[1:18:50] want God forgive me. You know, I knew better, but I still made a mistake. But can I have the
[1:18:55] same grace towards my f my my brother as my sister having the same attitude of forgiveness? Oh Lord,
[1:19:03] if I'm not there yet, help me to get to that level where I can have that type of forgiveness that
[1:19:09] comes from the heart. Even the prophet didn't have the true revelation at some point of this
[1:19:15] scripture. He was quick to condemn that woman when he came in that restaurant or something. They came
[1:19:20] there and he found her with the policeman and and then she was immoral and things like that
[1:19:25] and he start condemning her. How is it possible? And and he said shut just wipe them away and that
[1:19:31] attitude. Then God had to show him now say see now but when you do make a mistake you see how
[1:19:38] I forgive you. You see and you see how you hurt me. And he saw that the blood was like a bumper
[1:19:44] for everything and that was coming and hit him. And the Lord Jesus Christ was taking it upon him
[1:19:50] and he was bleeding. The blood of Jesus Christ was saying pardon, forgive him. Justice of God would
[1:19:55] have killed him. But the blood of Jesus Christ was the bumper protecting him. And the prophet says,
[1:20:01] "Oh Lord, forgive me. Forgive me." And then when he came out, then Lord said, "You see,
[1:20:06] you asking for forgiveness for yourself. What about the other one? Can't you extend a little
[1:20:12] bit of grace towards her?" And the prophet went to her says he didn't come now condemning her. Now
[1:20:18] he took the other approach said Lord my sister you know I've been condemning you but see what
[1:20:23] the Lord expressed to me and everything and and God and and there there she gave her heart to the
[1:20:28] Lord Jesus Christ. Sometimes it's the attitude that we have behind corrections that's what is
[1:20:35] the problem. Amen. It's true. I'm trying to be balanced here. So some some it's a wrong thing
[1:20:41] but but what the approach you take sometimes makes a big difference in the approach you
[1:20:46] take you want that person to be saved you want that person to be redeemed so I don't I don't
[1:20:52] want to condemn I'm not judging you but I'm just I I want you to be saved what you're doing is it
[1:20:58] really representing Christ and then you you give you give a lifeline to someone else to rescue him
[1:21:14] Prophet says living, dying, burying, rising, coming. Come Lord Jesus Christ. Yes Lord come
[1:21:19] now. That's the hour if so please. So that the way to feel about it loving me, dying for me,
[1:21:25] buried for me, rising, justified me. He justified freely forever. Now I'm looking for you to come.
[1:21:31] Lord, I want to have the same kind of spirit in me that you had in you. I want that kind of a spirit
[1:21:37] that my enemy's speech could be hanging from my face and with all my heart I could still say I
[1:21:44] forgive you for it and I could forgive others as God for Christ's sake forgive us. Are we there
[1:21:52] yet? Oh Lord help me to get there. Father even the spit still on my face be able to say Lord
[1:22:00] forgive them. They talk bad about me. They talk bad about my children. They talk about one but
[1:22:05] Lord still forgive them. Lord I will pray for my worst enemies. I'll still I I'll still love
[1:22:10] him. I'll still keep the right attitude towards him. Lord help me to get there to be like Jesus.
[1:22:16] I have to be there. Lord help me to be there. Father. Oh Lord Jesus Christ. Even the prophet
[1:22:22] himself God put him to a test one time. God put him to the test. That test was not you know the
[1:22:27] prophet you know how hard it is upon upon upon immorality and is very hard. But God gave him a
[1:22:34] test in the church, not in other place. In the church. And I look at that sometimes. I say,
[1:22:40] "Oh Lord, help me. Lord, I'll put you into the test." Immorality in the church. He tried to
[1:22:46] correct them. They don't want they want to correct them. I wonder where was the deacon.
[1:22:50] Sometimes try to correct them. They don't want then says and something tells him if you say deaf,
[1:22:59] they'll be there. You say blind, there will be blind right there.
[1:23:02] It shows you can't play in church. So it's a serious place. He could have tell death and
[1:23:07] they will be dead. But something came upon him. He says I forgive you. I forgive you. And it was
[1:23:15] the one of the greatest test because he had to put his own mind aside and extend forgiveness to them.
[1:23:28] Godliness is expressed through service. And I like this one personally. Godess endure weakness
[1:23:37] in others with grace. The song that we see in the statue of perfectness says to be like Jesus. To
[1:23:43] be like Jesus on earth I long to be like him. All through life journey from earth to glory. I only
[1:23:49] ask to be like Jesus. Another place you will say the first song I have loved in the hymns is one
[1:23:55] of the greatest was to be like Jesus. If serving for others what's pleasing God the most. Lord help
[1:24:02] me to make me servant for others. That's what the life of Jesus Christ. He was a servant for others.
[1:24:09] Is this the Bible say the son of man came not to be ministered onto but to minister to others.
[1:24:15] So that's what the Bible is saying. Love love should serve one another in loneliness of mind.
[1:24:20] Let each esteem other better than themselves. Oh Lord help me to be a servant for others.
[1:24:26] Lord help me to reflect the life of Jesus Christ. The Bible makes clear that godliness is not
[1:24:32] imitation alone. It's Christ life within. It has to be Christ life from the inside. That's what I
[1:24:40] want to put my focus here. Godliness is not only trying to confirm or even though it has a part
[1:24:46] in the natural in the outside and everything but more than that godliness comes from the inside.
[1:24:53] Let the life of Jesus Christ brings that godliness of God. Lord, I I desire the life of Jesus Christ
[1:25:00] to remove the desire of the things of the world to remove the desire that keeps me captive of slaves.
[1:25:06] Lord, remove that desire. Don't I don't have that does not have to become my struggle in the flesh,
[1:25:12] but has to become the Holy Spirit doing the work from the inside. That was pure godliness
[1:25:18] God is desiring. As the prophet says in the Israel says as we started off Ephesus ending
[1:25:23] up this year the lukewarm church age where we are now having a form of godliness by denying
[1:25:29] the power thereof. We don't want the form of godliness. We don't want just to be on
[1:25:35] the outside and look godly from the outside when the inside is still dirty. No, no, no, no. Lord,
[1:25:41] I want the power of the Holy Ghost. I want the power to change me from the inside outside. Lord,
[1:25:47] I want you to move, Lord, in my heart. I want the Holy Ghost. I want the new birth. I want Christ
[1:25:53] to be a mature Christian in me. Lord, that's my desire. I don't want just a form of godliness.
[1:26:02] I want the power of the godliness. The prophet says going to church and having people come in
[1:26:08] and say I accept Christ and putting their name on the book, but they're denying the
[1:26:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the power and the miracles and the signs and the wonders,
[1:26:18] making fun of it in our churches. We dispute from God's mouth and the elect taken up. Oh,
[1:26:24] hallelujah. Something gets into my soul when I think of it, friends, the world in its condition
[1:26:30] today. But we want the power of the Holy Ghost in the church. Amen. We on the powerful miracles,
[1:26:36] the powerful changing life, the powerful holy life, and the fire life through the
[1:26:41] power of the Holy Ghost. Amen. And signs and wonders. That's what we desire. Amen.
[1:26:51] Now remember the black bird with pickup feathers. Don't forget him. Don't try to add it till you
[1:26:58] are actually born again because it won't work. You can't make it work. It will come to this
[1:27:04] or this here and it will crumble somewhere. But when you get down here, genuine born again dove,
[1:27:12] then you don't add nothing. It adds to you. I like that. You don't add anything and force anything
[1:27:19] then it adds up to you and comes all right. Coming out into perfection. Christ in you is the hope
[1:27:27] of glory. The hope of glory is the life of Jesus Christ in you. And now we have the restored word
[1:27:35] of God that has brought the literal life of Jesus Christ. We have the ability to be like Christ.
[1:27:44] Now brother when you look at him people don't know they they will confuse him to Jesus Christ.
[1:27:50] You say you are not too far from me too. Amen. Because the life of Jesus Christ is inside of me.
[1:27:57] But it was not only for the prophet only. It also for each believer because we have received
[1:28:03] the pure word of God that should bring a godly life to the point where people see Christ in us.
[1:28:10] Amen. Walking again. What we desire is not is not is not too much noise. What we desire is a
[1:28:17] godly life in Jeffersonville. Godly sanctified life in Edmonton, too. That's the thunder that
[1:28:24] shakes the enemy when he see sanctified, dedicated life of Jesus Christ through the power of the Holy
[1:28:31] Ghost moving the people. Amen. That's what we desire. I hope I'm putting a little bit
[1:28:37] of desire in your heart. Lord, I want more. I want more. I want more. I can't stay in
[1:28:43] the statical. I can't just stay, you know, that I've reached there. No, Lord, I want more. Amen.
[1:28:55] I live yet not I but Christ liveth me as the Bible we have read at the beginning according
[1:29:00] as divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life of godliness. We have
[1:29:06] received the word of God reveal all things that should bring us to the whole godliness
[1:29:15] representation of Jesus Christ. One more time and say the Bible says according as his divine
[1:29:21] power has given us unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness. That's my prayer. Lord,
[1:29:28] give me that power. Amen. Give me that power. Amen. So if I'm still
[1:29:34] struggling with worldly ideas of marriage today young people or those married the
[1:29:41] place of a woman or the position of a man Lord take those worldly ideas away
[1:29:50] today can you say wife be submit respect your husband it becomes hard today
[1:30:01] what are you thinking you're thinking that we inferior. Okay. No,
[1:30:05] no. It's okay. It's okay. I don't want problem. Peace in my head. No.
[1:30:11] You rule the house. I'm okay. No. No. No. No. No. No. God. Take those worldly ideas away.
[1:30:18] Wash me. Cleanse me. Give me the mind of Jesus Christ. Lord, if you you desire submission,
[1:30:25] I will submit myself. Lord, as long as it is your word, I will humble myself to the word of God.
[1:30:31] Amen. Praise be to God. But the message sometimes is hard, but the bride has the ability by God's
[1:30:41] grace. Just say, "Let it be done to me according to your word, Lord. I love you." Amen. How a
[1:30:48] blessing. Oh, can husband put a little bit of like brother B and wash the dishes? Oh, no,
[1:30:54] no, no, no, no, no. Mimi, you know, I'm a I'm a husband. Wash the dishes. No, no, no, no, no.
[1:31:01] That's That's woman's work. Hey, come on, brother. Go wash the dishes. Almost said it in French, but
[1:31:14] it's in a message. Brother Bam did it. You You have to do it. Help your wife. And that that that
[1:31:22] what shows a real man. It's not like a man just don't want to go there, but it was not bad. Amen.
[1:31:30] A man is also humble. He he humble himself. He does the work and he help the wife. You love her
[1:31:38] like Christ loved you. Don't say sometime we don't have the representation of what Jesus Christ did
[1:31:43] for us. We just want the part that benefit us. But the other part where we have to be servant,
[1:31:48] we leave it aside. We just know God Jesus could do that but not me. No,
[1:31:53] be like Jesus Christ. Die for your wife. Be there. Be the one standing for your wife. Be the one. You
[1:32:00] see she's weak. You stand there. You protect her. You be there. That's the real man. Amen.
[1:32:12] Too much of uh boasting boasting sometimes it's cultural things but the word of God
[1:32:20] come to take those cultures. You come to take all those background of your families,
[1:32:26] German families and no you know Irish families, congalles families, Zimbabwean
[1:32:33] families all those things background. Let the wash the word of God wash us and cleanse us,
[1:32:40] bring us the godliness of God. I want to be like Christ. Amen. Papa Matenda was saying one time
[1:32:48] testimony when he got baptized, he received the message of the hour. He was carrying his
[1:32:54] baby first born and the sister was walking and he was in the village. The only man who
[1:33:01] could carry a baby and people were making fun of him. What kind of man was carrying a baby? She a
[1:33:07] woman's job. But the wife couldn't for reason. I don't remember what he was saying, but he was he
[1:33:15] was willing to help stepping for her. That's what the real man you steing for your wife.
[1:33:31] Statue of perfect man. Godliness means to be like God. Oh my. After you got faith, virtue,
[1:33:37] knowledge, temperance, patience, then be like God. Few you say I can't do that brother Bana he says
[1:33:44] yes you can yes you can say no I can't do no yes you can why because you have received the word of
[1:33:51] God and you are a son of God you can by the Holy Spirit through the power of the Holy Ghost you
[1:33:57] can don't say you can't you can God has given you everything so that you can this eve cannot fail
[1:34:05] you will succeed you will have victory you can I'm here to encourage you that you can by God the Holy
[1:34:12] Spirit because that's the promise of God. You can. You think that I can't dress like a Christian. You
[1:34:20] can. I can't pray like Jesus prayed. You can. I can't forgive like Jesus forgive. You can. I
[1:34:26] can't talk like Jesus talked. You can. Oh, I can't I live a holy life. You can. You can. You can. You
[1:34:33] can. Because that's what the word of God says. And you have to believe and you will do it. Amen.
[1:34:40] says, "Let me just read a few scriptures here for a minute." The prophet says in the statue
[1:34:45] of prophet man, Matthew 5:48, we'll take this one says Jesus said, it says, see, if you're supposed
[1:34:52] to be like God, you know, the Bible says you are God's. I like that. So, he's not saying to be like
[1:34:58] God just to confirm to be like Jesus. No, you can be like God because you are you are amateur gods.
[1:35:10] So God is not asking you something that you are not. He's asking you what you are. You just need
[1:35:17] to recognize that I am. What the word of God says that who I am. I want just to reflect
[1:35:22] who I am. Sometimes we have been like chicken. We didn't know that we could fly. We are low
[1:35:28] and following the stage of the world. We are just in in the chicken yard and doing things
[1:35:33] like the word. Then the word of God comes and reveal to us, you are not a chicken. You are
[1:35:38] a [ __ ] You can fly higher. You can live a holy life. You can be godly. You are God. So be godly
[1:35:48] because that's your nature. You are not trying to imitate something else. You are God. Be like God.
[1:35:55] Amen. Amen. Thank God for the message of the hour to reveal to us who we are. I'm not a chicken. I
[1:36:02] am an eagle. I can fly higher. Amen. Praise be to God. I will not confirm Julio this year. I'll be
[1:36:10] transformed on the inside because I am an eagle. Praise be to God. So that was and the devil came
[1:36:19] to Eve trying to tell you know if you eat from this tree of of knowledge of good and evil,
[1:36:24] you will be like God. And Eve wanted to be like God. She didn't know that she was already God.
[1:36:31] She was an amateur God. If the word of God was revealed to her, he get the revelation of who
[1:36:37] she was. She would have not failed. But thank God this Eve won't fail. Why? Because she knows who
[1:36:44] she is. I'm not going to be like God. I am already God. I am an amateur God. That's why I believe.
[1:36:52] That's why I live the way I live because I am what the word of God says. The Bible says you,
[1:36:57] it was the word of God. You are part of the word of God. Why do you believe the word of
[1:37:01] God? because I am the word of God. I like what brother Victor says last Sunday. You know,
[1:37:07] you are the word of you ask even your prayer. You are claiming what you are because you are the word
[1:37:12] of God. So even when you pray, you pray the word of God because you are the word of God. Glory to
[1:37:19] God. Amen. So he say be perfect. Be imperfect. And Jesus I didn't finish the call of the prophet says
[1:37:26] Jesus said so why all the virtue and he says all the things that in God is now in you is in you
[1:37:34] Matthew 5:48 Jesus speaking to the batitude says be therefore perfect what's that perfect even as
[1:37:43] your father in heaven is perfect so God by saying perfect there doesn't mean that you don't have no
[1:37:49] mistakes no you have a mistakes but you are a mature Christian perfect there is mean mature.
[1:37:55] You are mature son and daughter of God. You think like him. You make decisions like him. You have
[1:38:00] the character of Christ in you. Hallelujah. So godliness is a requirement. It's not an option.
[1:38:07] Just just give me time here. I'm closing. Give me a few few minutes again here. I'll be going
[1:38:12] maybe to the statue of perfect man just to read what prophet statue of perfect man. If you read
[1:38:17] read says uh another message says uh you got you you got way up here before you asked to do
[1:38:25] that all these things had to be added first and when you get up is asking you now to be perfect
[1:38:31] godliness sons and daughters of God that's right how many things I could say along that path but
[1:38:36] how can you get to that perfection how do you get to that maturity he will give two answers
[1:38:41] to that another message says God himself came down into a blood cell and wiped the blood around him,
[1:38:47] the blood cell, the germ of life of God himself, riped in his blood cell that drew forth the son
[1:38:52] Christ Jesus. What is that? To make you perfect and to bring you back into fellowship. He brings
[1:38:59] you through that blood cell into himself. Thank God for the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:39:05] Do you want to serve God? Take the blood of Jesus Christ. He brings you back into
[1:39:10] fellowship with God. You get it? says through the blood cell of the Lord Jesus that inve
[1:39:24] how he's bring us to perfection. That's what God sees. God when he looks at you, it doesn't look
[1:39:30] you see sin sin or sinful person. No, no, that not the way God looks at you. He looks you through the
[1:39:35] blood. You are perfect. There's nothing. There's no blemish. That's the bride. That God looking
[1:39:41] at her. You are perfect. Even this morning, you are still perfect. That's how God looks at you.
[1:39:48] Praise be to God. Sometimes we look at ourselves, I'm not worthy and but God looks at you say you
[1:39:54] are perfect. Praise be to God. You can come to him just oh Lord forgive me and the blood
[1:39:59] of which is going to wash you. Perfect in God's sight. Thank God for that. But then he's going
[1:40:05] the other side says the next step is how now man sees you. It has to work on both sides. Then it
[1:40:12] says chapter Ephesians statue of perfect Ephesians the 4th chapter begin with the 12 verse Ephesians
[1:40:18] 4 and begin with the 12 verse. All right let's begin up here in the in the 11th verse. He gave
[1:40:24] some apostles and some prophet remember last night don't try to take the other man's office. He sent
[1:40:32] some apostles sent some prophet. We don't want to take the place of the prophet the major prophet.
[1:40:38] No, the prophet is a prophet. You I don't have I don't have the ability to come here and correct
[1:40:45] the prophet. No, that's not my position. That's not my office. No, no, no, no. Even if I say no,
[1:40:52] he made he made instead of calling Elijah, he called Elisha, not it's not me. He say no,
[1:40:57] he made a mistake. Look at the mist. No, no, that's not my office. That's the business
[1:41:02] of God himself. Amen. Even if you believe I believe even if you believe that it was Elijah,
[1:41:07] Elisha and that mistake and you give your heart to the Lord with that mistake, God will honor that
[1:41:12] because that's the office of the prophet. Amen. The office of the pastor is helping the people.
[1:41:18] Amen. To align with the word of God. Amen. So we don't take someone else's office. Don't take the
[1:41:24] office of an evangelist. People now you see evangelist everybody want to become a pastor.
[1:41:29] I I'm an evangelist. Mighty evangelist. People appreciate for being an evangelist but one day
[1:41:35] no I want to my have my own church no stay evangelist you have blessing when you're an
[1:41:40] evangelist why do you want to become a pastor stay evangelist that's your position now everybody want

[1:41:52] church a pastor stays with his church don't be all the time and every month you are somewhere
[1:41:59] no what kind of pastor to stay in your office. Amen. Sometimes you can travel here sometime
[1:42:08] you help here because you're gifted but not all every month you're somewhere. No, no, no, no. I
[1:42:12] question where kind of person is. What? That's not the office of pastor. You become missionary. Ch is
[1:42:20] it okay? That's right. Don't try to take others man's office. Some evangelists and some pastors
[1:42:28] and some teachers for the perfecting prophet say for the perfecting of God. So it doesn't
[1:42:34] read like that. Congre congregation says no the perfecting of what? Saints. Who are the saints?
[1:42:42] The sanctified ones. Amen. The ones started from down here perfecting the saints for the working of
[1:42:48] the ministry. And it says the ministry of Jesus Christ for the edifying of the body of Christ.
[1:42:54] for the edifying, building up, edifying until till we all come into the unity of the faith,
[1:43:00] the knowledge of the son of God, the perfect man unto the assurance, the measure of the
[1:43:06] statue of the fullness of Christ. Perfect takes godliness. Amen. For me, that's a wonderful quote.
[1:43:15] Amen. Because you want to get to perfection, you want to get to to the statue of a perfect man,
[1:43:23] you need the five-fold ministry. You need all the five. Don't just be in one relying on one. That
[1:43:30] won't that won't bring you to the full stature of a perfect man. No, you'll be skipping godliness.
[1:43:37] No, you can't be. And you allow me just to say few notes here, a few few of my thoughts here.
[1:43:43] If you allow me to say that, you you need both. You need both. Let me tell you, if you only have
[1:43:50] the Bible at home and you are reading the Bible every day at home by yourself, let me tell you,
[1:43:57] you won't become you can't reach the stature of a perfect man just with the Bible. Shocking because
[1:44:08] you you can't it's the word of God. You need a five-fold ministry. You you can't because all
[1:44:17] the denomination they have the Bible. They have the same Bible. They for 2,000 years they have the
[1:44:22] same. It's the whole word of God is the perfect will of God. It is all the word of God is in the
[1:44:28] Bible. But with just that alone you can't come to the statue of the perfect man of today. No.
[1:44:34] You might become maybe in Lutheran age and under the man anointing but under the eagle anointing
[1:44:40] you can't come to the statue of the perfect man. It's impossible. Amen. Amen. You can be at home
[1:44:49] just listening to the tapes of brother Vanam. You will not reach the stature of a perfect man. Any
[1:44:55] church that is only relying on the tape of brother vanam is not a mature church. I'm sorry to say
[1:45:00] that but that's the word of God. And you see that you see burdeness, you believe with criticism,
[1:45:05] arrogance. It's important. It's breaking the word of God. You need a five-fold ministry. Amen. So
[1:45:14] you have to respect the whole word of God. Don't just and take the part that convenient to me. No,
[1:45:19] but I was betrayed by that pastor. He hurt me on money problem. Yeah,
[1:45:25] that's that's their problem. But you obey the word of God. Godliness is about pleasing God,
[1:45:31] not pleasing man. Not trying to show to another man. No, you stay faithful the word of God. That's
[1:45:37] your call. Lord, I want to be pleasing to you. Amen. Amen. And let me tell you now, just having
[1:45:50] I want to put it just having the five-fold ministry without the prophet,
[1:45:55] you can't come to the statue of a perfect man. That's right. Some people get shocked
[1:46:00] and you put a tape in the church. A tape? No. Hey, don't don't stumble.
[1:46:08] Yeah, it's part there's a tape ministry can put a tape and you enjoy it. Oh, thank God. You are
[1:46:14] balanced. You have become you have become a statue of the perfect man. It's all together. Amen. Amen.
[1:46:22] Amen. That's right. To the perfecting to come to the knowledge of Christ to come to all those good
[1:46:29] promises here you need everything. You need the Bible. You need the prophet. You need a five-fold
[1:46:36] ministry. You need your brother. You need your sister. You need a deacon. You need You need a
[1:46:43] parent. You You need a the sister, the heavenly sister. You need a headerly brothers. We need
[1:46:48] everyone to come to the statue of a perfect man. Otherwise, we are missing something.
[1:47:01] Now, just bear with me. I'll read some of the quote to back up what they've said.
[1:47:08] position. The prophet says, the fellow said, "I can be a Christian and stay home just as
[1:47:13] well." The prophet says, "No, you can't. It's impossible. But I'm a Christian.
[1:47:19] I'm born again. I believe the message of the error. I can just stay home."
[1:47:27] I had a friend, thank God for that friend. He used to call, "Anybody stays home is a
[1:47:32] backsliding Christian. He was just straight. Said, "Are you going to church?" "No, no,
[1:47:37] I'm I'm listening to the backs leader." He just stayed with me saying I was a You can't
[1:47:44] be a mature Christian staying home. Impossible. Impossible. You are just faking yourself. You're
[1:47:50] just lying to yourself. You won't grow. You won't grow. You will stay the tape. You know some of the
[1:47:55] quotes and everything, but you are not getting mature. Impossible. Otherwise, the the word of
[1:48:00] God, let's close the Bible and go home, then which breaks the word of God. It's impossible.
[1:48:07] Says, "No, you've got to meet together with the rest of the body. He has blessed us together
[1:48:12] in heavenly place in Christ Jesus." Luke 4:16 says, "He came to Nazareth where he
[1:48:18] had been brought up. And as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the
[1:48:24] Sabbath day and stood up to read." That was Jesus. And I want to be like Jesus. Then it
[1:48:32] has to be my customs to go to church to listen to the tape to pray to fellowship
[1:48:39] with others. If Jesus did I can do it. Are you more spiritual than Jesus? Break the scriptures.
[1:48:49] We feel that every person is duty bound. Another message what visions are. Every person is duty
[1:48:54] bound to attend some church and belong to some church as a Christians. Many people say, "Oh,
[1:48:59] I stay home and read my Bible. I'm just as well off. I read the whole word of God." The Bible
[1:49:07] prophet says, "No." The Bible says, "You shouldn't forsake the assemble ourselves together. We've got
[1:49:14] to do that. You've got to stand together and all the churches." So where do you
[1:49:19] get that idea that you can be flourishing as a Christian at home? It's impossible.
[1:49:28] When the Holy Spirit teaches an adulterate holiness before the Lord,
[1:49:32] how do you think the Holy Spirit feels to bring the word before the father that we are selfish,
[1:49:38] that we are unconcerned? We stay home on prayer meeting nights to watch old religious program.
[1:49:45] But I'm not staying home to watch Lucy. I love Lucy. I'm staying home to stream. It's a old
[1:49:53] It's a religious program. I'm in a Donny Rian's church. No, no, no, no, no, no. It's religious
[1:50:04] program. Says no, no, no. We are selfish. We are unconcerned. It's just about you. That's why
[1:50:14] staying home, taking a coffee and watching. Oh, that brother sings very well. That sister sing.
[1:50:23] And then and then you become a mature Christian. No, no. Let's stop faking ourselves. No. No.
[1:50:36] He says they stayed home and looked at televisions like the rest of them does and stay away from
[1:50:41] prayer meeting. Just a nominal Christian like too much of our America is today that Methodist,
[1:50:47] Baptist, Pentecostal all too. It's true that exactly right. We stay home to watch this
[1:50:52] and do that and take a little ride. It's too hot to go to church or something like that. I
[1:50:57] don't feel just good. You are going to feel worse than that some of these days when you
[1:51:04] are condemned at the judgment bar. Oh yeah. We don't preach too much about judgment bar,
[1:51:10] but you I'll say you'll go to hell. That's right. You don't come to you'll go to hell.
[1:51:15] You are candidate to go to hell. No matter what you believe, you are candidate to go to hell.
[1:51:19] You might go to judgment bar. Amen. That's serious. So, so take the whole word. Lord,
[1:51:26] I want to be pleasing to you. Not pleasing a man. Pleasing to you. You are denominations by being
[1:51:33] in the message. That's a denomination. That's your own idea. Be within the message. But Lord,
[1:51:40] take me out of those denominations idea. Let me take the whole word of God. I hope it's not
[1:51:46] hard. Amen. Just saying with love. I'm just taking what the prophet says to bring us into
[1:51:51] perfection. How can you get to perfection? You need Ephesians 4. You need to assemble
[1:51:57] together. Ephesians is the adoptions. Don't leave the assembled together. Amen.
[1:52:06] Prayer meetings comes you stay home watch their television instead of going out at the prayer
[1:52:11] meeting. Isn't that right? Sure it is. Everything time to read the papers. People have time to do
[1:52:16] this. time to have your society gathering and things but no time for God. No, let me give you
[1:52:22] the joke a little bit here. You know, on Wednesday we cancel the service, right? Then I drove and you
[1:52:27] know actually not bad when around 700 p.m. Okay, then I So the following day I went to work. I mean
[1:52:36] I think I was in conference with one colleague. So there was a girl say, "You know what? We had
[1:52:41] a party planned for Wednesday night." And then we got that warning. You know what? Some of us
[1:52:48] just say, "No, let's go to the party no matter what." And we enjoyed our party. It was so good.
[1:52:54] And I was just there. The world, they went to the party and enjoyed the party. And me, a Christian,
[1:53:02] a pastor, sending a message that cancelled the church. Shame on me. I felt so bad a little bit.
[1:53:12] But God knows everything. Amen. But I felt a little bad. I don't know why
[1:53:16] why it has happened that she had to put bring that up and put a little bit of
[1:53:20] comparisons. If they party, they have to honor that. What about church? You know,
[1:53:24] kind of kind of put me a little bit of stigma. God forgive me. Um
[1:53:34] then how can you say you can stay home and that a prophet very good quote how can you
[1:53:41] say you stay home and be just as good as Christian as you will be at church
[1:53:49] I'm repeating it how can you say you can stay home and be just as good a Christian as you would
[1:53:56] be at church prophet say you Can't do that. Read the word of God. You can't do that. Amen. Amen.
[1:54:08] That was not my emphasis. But it's good that we remind the people so that we align oursel
[1:54:12] with the word of God. I want perfection. Lord, help me to prove my ideas and help me to align
[1:54:18] myself with the word of God. So my theme really my focus is what I say. The mystery of godliness
[1:54:25] was Christ. God manifested in the flesh in Jesus Christ. But that was not the whole plan of God.
[1:54:32] The mystery of godliness is Christ now pouring himself into the church today. It's the same God
[1:54:40] who wants to live inside of a human being. Inside of those who are sanctified, born again. God want
[1:54:47] to live his own life through us. Amen. That's the mystery of godness that's still unfolding.
[1:54:53] You are actually the expression of Jesus Christ today. As Jesus Christ was expression of God,
[1:54:58] we are the expression of Jesus Christ. In all things, we desire to honor God. And I'll read
[1:55:04] the prophet to to back up what I've just said. says in the position of seven churches he says
[1:55:09] if this is true then it must also be true that the bride church will mature and her
[1:55:14] ripeness shall be in identification with her lord by means of the word and her head who
[1:55:21] will come to her is the mystery of godliness which indeed is Christ. So when you receive
[1:55:28] Christ inside of her and you receive the head, you receive Christ inside of you. That's still
[1:55:34] the mystery of godliness because God has restore the word of God. With the restoration of the word
[1:55:40] will come the restoration of the power. He is now in you. You are his attribute. You've got
[1:55:46] eternal life. Your life always was. You was God thinking the color of hair. Whatever you are,
[1:55:51] you was God thinking. You are just materialized. And that's what God was when he was materialized
[1:55:56] in Christ. God displayed manifest in flesh in Christ it became material that God could
[1:56:02] we could touch. Amen. Let me just say again if we can fellowship was through the riches of his
[1:56:08] word which you are a part of. You are part of the word because it was the word at the beginning. You
[1:56:13] are the word now. I'm preaching tonight on Sunday one of the day when I get about what the word is.
[1:56:18] Now you are part of the word. Amen. If it was the word of God you are now part of the word of God.
[1:56:25] And God isn't a man. is identifying himself today in his church. In the born again Christian, God
[1:56:31] identifies himself that he remains God. Outside the world will only know God as they see God in
[1:56:38] you and I. That the only way that they'll know God is when we are written epistles, epistle of the
[1:56:44] scripture. We are read of old man. That life that we live reflect what God inside of us. A man is
[1:56:50] identified by the works that he does. So our works should be good. See always good because we are
[1:56:56] representing our Lord Jesus Christ. I want to be like God because I am God already. I'm a mature
[1:57:03] God. That's why I want to be like God to reflect Jesus Christ. People will know Christ only through
[1:57:10] us. Written epistle of Jesus Christ. Musicians can come. God over you. God with us. Now God in us.
[1:57:22] All that God was, he poured into Christ that Christmas. A real Christmas. What God was,
[1:57:28] he poured into Christ. All that Christ was, he poured into the church. At that day,
[1:57:34] you will know that I am in the father, the father in me, I in you, and you in me. It's been God all
[1:57:39] day. You see, is is the same works. The church is ordained to carry on on his work with the
[1:57:44] same spirit. You couldn't carry on the same work without the same spirit. That's right.
[1:57:49] The same spirit carries on the work. Amen. The other part I bring maybe another time a portion
[1:57:58] that I didn't touch but touch another time. Thank God. Flow through me. Holy Spirit flow through me.
[1:58:14] Flow through me. Holy Spirit flow through me as I lift my hands to a shify
[1:58:38] flow through me. Holy Spirit flow through. Can we stand together and sing? Help our brothers
[1:58:51] here. There's no You're learning that song, right? Holy Spirit flow through me.
[1:59:05] All through me. Holy Spirit flow through me
[1:59:18] as I dig my head to worshipy
[1:59:30] thy name. flow through me. Holy Spirit, flow through me. Is that the desire of your heart,
[1:59:43] Lord? That Holy Spirit flow through me. All I desire is the power of the Holy Ghost to
[1:59:47] move my life, to change me, to change my way of thinking so I can reflect Christ. One more time.
[1:59:58] Oh, flow through me. Holy Spirit, flow through me
[2:00:11] as I lift my hands to worship and to my right. flow through me. Holy Spirit,
[2:00:31] flow through me. To be like Jesus. Let's sing that song. To be like Jesus.
[2:00:45] to be like Jesus.
[2:00:53] On earth I long to be like you.
[2:01:04] All through life's journey
[2:01:11] from faith to glory.
[2:01:17] I only ask to be like him. One more time. To be like Jesus.
[2:01:35] to be like like Jesus.
[2:01:42] On earth I hope
[2:01:48] to be like him.
[2:01:55] God's rule journey
[2:02:01] from death to glory.
[2:02:08] I only ask to be like him. Is that the desire of your heart? As our heads are bow down just
[2:02:24] take a little moment just to meditate upon the word of God is not to speak about any person and
[2:02:31] particular to try to put condemnation anything as the prophet says our holiness is not about our own
[2:02:40] holiness it's about God's holiness but father let my desire be to be pleasing to you Father,
[2:02:49] Lord, thank you. If there is something that need to change, help me to change because my desire
[2:02:56] is to please you, Lord. Whatever you have in store for me, I desire just to please you. Jesus
[2:03:01] Christ lived as he loved, Lord, to serve you, to serve others, to forgive. Father, help me to be
[2:03:12] that kind of person. To be like Jesus, not to be selfish, not to look at the only my status, only
[2:03:20] do things when it pleases me. But the father even sometimes when it does not please me. But Lord,
[2:03:26] I want to be a servant for others. I desire the power not only the form of godliness or
[2:03:33] a religious spirit or a message title but when the life is not reflecting the life of Christ
[2:03:42] and there is something wrong but help me Lord to be sincere with myself and sincere with others
[2:03:48] sincere with you Lord I desire to please you can we just bring that in prayer and then each
[2:03:54] one is praying Lord our desire is to be like You father desire father lord is to be changed from
[2:04:03] the inside out father that's still worldliness worldliness is not only father lord the immorality
[2:04:09] worldliness is the the way of leodyia thinking that's worldliness father lord the conception
[2:04:19] the easy life or lukewarm spirit lukewarm religion father lord people where we lose the passion for
[2:04:27] the word of god zeal for the word of God or become just too selfish. Lord, take that away from me,
[2:04:33] God. I give me the life of Jesus Christ, the literal life of Jesus Christ. Help me,
[2:04:39] Father, to live like knowing that I'm a son of God, son of the king. Oh God, for the sister,
[2:04:47] I'm a daughter of the king. I'm I'm a I'm a queen. I'm a princess, father Lord, and to live like a
[2:04:53] nigle to go beyond the conception of Leodysia. But father to climb higher to be like Christ. The word
[2:05:00] of God expresses to us what Christ was. Help us Lord to match what the word of God says. Father

[2:05:12] said you can't open the door. You want them to be saved. You want people to be saved. You want
[2:05:16] people to be mature. But you can't open the door. You are a gentle man until the persons open the
[2:05:21] door. until the person is willing to say Lord I I forsake myself I forsake my ideas but I want
[2:05:28] to take your word then father you can bring him to another level that's the way you work father

[2:06:11] but all for your glory, Lord. It's not a man, but it's you about you. Yes. May yourself, Father,
