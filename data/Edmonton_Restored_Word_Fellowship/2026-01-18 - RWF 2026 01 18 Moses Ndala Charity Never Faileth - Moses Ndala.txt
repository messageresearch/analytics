Summary of the Sermon: “Charity Never Faileth” 

Brother Moses opens by explaining that the phrase “charity never faileth” (1 Corinthians 13:8) does not refer merely to good deeds or humanitarian charity, but to agape—the very love of God placed within the believer’s heart. This love is not natural affection, brotherly kindness, or emotion, but God’s own self-giving, unconditional love. Brother Moses stresses that this love cannot be manufactured by human effort; it grows as believers remain in the Word, prayer, and fellowship with God. Drawing parallels with marriage, he shows how continued communion deepens love, leading to spiritual victory. Without this perfect love, he teaches, believers cannot fully overcome in this last age (John 4:16; 1 John 4:8).

He then establishes that God is love, and knowing God is inseparable from knowing His love. Intellectual knowledge of Scripture alone is insufficient; true knowledge of God comes through experiencing His love by the Holy Ghost (1 John 4:10, 19). Brother Moses emphasizes that redemption is not reactive—God did not begin loving humanity after the fall—but eternal and sovereign, rooted before the foundation of the world (Ephesians 1:4–6; Romans 5:8). Here he aligns closely with Brother Branham’s teaching that salvation rests on God’s elective love and grace, not human merit. This revelation removes fear and instability, replacing them with assurance and faith.

Drawing on Brother Branham’s sermons such as Exposition of the Seven Church Ages, Adoption, and The Stature of a Perfect Man, Brother Moses explains that love precedes grace, and grace precedes election. He references Brother Branham’s illustration of the mother opossum, showing that when love is projected, divine grace takes over—how much more so for a believer projecting God’s love. Circumstances, whether favorable or difficult, are not measures of God...

And uh the testimony says, "I'd like to praise the Lord Jesus for for healing my back. Uh brother Moses prayed for me and the Jesus Jesus touched me." Glory to the Lord. That's from Sister Murray. So, we just we thank the Lord for for healing and for grace. And then there's a a prayer request that says, "Can you please remember uh my father-in-law, Sister Trina's dad. We uh just received news that he's not feeling well." So, that's from Brother Joseph. So, we can just we can go to the Lord and we'll bring those needs before. Just bow our heads with me. Lord, Father in heaven, Lord, Lord, we're in your house, Lord. And Lord, we we come to this building, Lord, not to gain heaven, Lord, but to gain you, Lord. We all these things we do, Lord, we we don't do, Lord, that we could set foot in heaven, Lord. But that we can have a a relationship with you, Lord. That we can see you face to face, Lord, and and Lord, and experience fellowship beyond measure, Lord, with you, Lord. Lord, there's no amount of anything, Lord, that would convince me, Lord, to get to heaven just to see streets made of gold or to see a great pyramid that that shine in the sun, Lord. But I want to see you face to face, Lord. Those things are attributes of who you are, Lord. And I want to see you, Lord, face to face, Lord. And we and Lord, just as we don't want to see, Lord, a man speaking, Lord, we want to see you speaking, Lord. We want to hear you, Lord. Lord, speak to our hearts, Lord. And Lord, and and give us what we have in in due season, Lord. And just as the Israelites, Lord, they went through the desert, Lord. They they had manifold from heaven, Lord. Would you speak to us, Lord? Would you, Lord, give us, Lord, what we need to hear, Lord, what we need to feed on, Lord, and Father, we uh bring Sister Trina, Lord, uh, Father, Lord, before you. And we just ask, Lord, that you'd go to his wayside, Lord, that you'd you'd comfort him, Lord, that you'd strengthen him, Lord. That Lord, he could see you, Lord, as a healer. that he could rejoice in you, Lord, as a healer, Lord. Lord, we give healing, Lord, and in Jesus Christ's name, according to your favor, Lord, according to your will, Lord, according to the Lord, the authority, Lord, you give to your to your children, Lord. And Lord, we just thank you, Lord, for healing, Lord, and Lord, for Lord, Sister Marie, and and just Lord, if there's any need here, Lord, we can Lord, we bring it to you, Lord.

And and Lord, and minister to them wherever they are. And Lord, we just ask, Lord, that you'd have your way this morning. And we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. You can have your seats if you like. Make me more like thee, Jes. Jesus, make me more like thee. Give me a heart that's filled with love. and make me more like thee. Oh, make me more like thee, Jesus. Make me more like thee. Give me a heart that's filled with love and make me more like thee. I want to live the way that he wants me to live. I want to give until there's just no more to give. I want to love love till there's just no more love. For I could never ever out love the Lord. I want to live the way that he wants me to live. I want to give until there's just no more to give. I want to love love till there's just no more love. For I could never ever love the Lord. You found me when I was so lonely. You found me when I was so blue. You love me when no one could love me. when no one knew just what to do. I want to live the way that you want me to live. I want to give until there's just no more to give. I want to love love till there's just no more love. For I could never ever love the Lord. For I could never ever love the Lord. Amen. Thank you. Sing. I pledge allegiance to the Lord. I have heard how Christians long ago were brought before a tyrant's throne. They were told that he would spare their life if they would renounce the name of Christ. But one by one they chose to die. The son of God they would not deny. Like a great angelic choir sings, I can almost hear their voicees ring. Oh, I pledge alance to the land. With all my strength, with all I am, I will seek to honor his command. I pledge alence to the lamb. Now the years have come and the years have gone and the cause of Jesus still goes on. Now our time has come to count the cost to reject this world to embrace the cross. And one by one, let us live our lives for for the one who died to give us life till the trumpet sounds on that final day. Let us proudly stand and boldly say, "Oh, I pledge alance to the lamb. With all my strength, with all I am, I will seek to honor his command. Oh, I pledge alce to the lamb. Let's stand. I pledge allegiance. Oh, I pledge alce to the lamb. With all my strength, with all I am, I will seek. Honor his command. I pledge alce to the land. The solid rock. there. But my hope is built in nothing less. My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus blood and righteousness. I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but holy mean on Jesus name. On Christ the solid rock I stand. Oh all other ground is sinking sand. All other ground is sinking sand. When darkness seems to hide his face, I rest on his unchanging grace. In every high and stormy gale, my anchor holds within the veil. On on Christ the solid rock I stand. Oh, all other ground is sinking sand. All other ground is sinking sand. His oath is co and his blood. Support me in the whelming blood. And all around my soul gives way. He then is all my hope and stay on solid rock I stand. Oh all other ground is sinking sand. Oh all other ground is sinking sand. when he shall come with trumpet sound. Oh, may I then in him be found dressed in his rightousness alone, fallless to stand before the throne. Rock the solid rock I stand. Oh, all other ground is sinking sand. Oh, other ground is sinking sand. &gt;&gt; And let's sing a Jesus took my burdens says brother Moses. Jesus took my burdens and rolled them in the sea. He rolled them in the sea. He rolled them in the sea. Now I have a victory that he has given me. All my sins and disgrace. He's rolled them in the sea. Took my unbelief. Jesus took my unbelief and rolled them in the sea. He rolled them in the sea. Yes, &gt;&gt; he rolled them in the sea. &gt;&gt; Now I have a victory that he has given me. All my sins and disgrace. He's rolled him in the sea. Jesus took my unbelief and rolled him in the sea. He rolled him in the sea. He rolled him in the sea. Now I have a victory that he has given me. All my sins and disgrace he's rolled them in the sea. Aren't you glad and thankful, grateful that God has taken your sins and rolled them in the sea &gt;&gt; that he does not remember them anymore. &gt;&gt; Not anymore. Anymore. Thank God. There's power. Power in the blood of the lamb. Let's sing it. Mom, &gt;&gt; there is power, &gt;&gt; power working power &gt;&gt; in the blood of the lamb.

There is power in the blood of the lamb this morning. &gt;&gt; If there is any sickness, any need, just just raise your hand to the Lord as we close our eyes and just express our love to our Lord. Precious heavenly father, we thank you your grace and your mercy. Lord, we thank you father because you are always faithful. As you said in your word, whatever two or three are gathered in my name, not in the name of another person, but we are here gather in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Because of your promise, Father, we know that you are here. We thank you, Father, for the atmosphere that you have already created, Lord, through the song service, through the gift, Father. Lord, oh God, we love you and appreciate you, Lord. We desire that the same presence continue to remain with us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, we have raised our hands before you. We are needy people. There's so many needs, Father. It might be the need for a closer walk with you. That's the greatest need that we have in our desire to have a closer walk with you, pleasing walk with you, Father. A relationship with you that is closer, intimate as never before, Father, where we see the power of the Lord Jesus Christ manifest in our lives. where we see our lives reflecting you, where we see our lives mirroring the word of God, Father. Oh God, there might be also a desire, Father Lord, maybe for financial needs, maybe Father Lord, for healing in the body, restoration of families, harmony, Lord, in families. It might be, Father Lord, the healing Lord for our loved ones. Whatever the need is, Lord, you are here. You said in your word, the one that is in you is greater than the one that is in the world. We are more than conqueror through Jesus Christ this morning. Father, we love you and appreciate you. Thank you for the blood of the lamb. Thank you for the blood that has cleansed us, washed us that set us free. Father, we give you the glory and the honor. Lord, help us, Lord, as we go through the part of the service where you speak through the word of God. Father, help to put the speaker aside, put the hearer aside, Father, let the Holy Spirit hear through us, Father, as we commit oursel to you, Lord. We break any chain of the enemy, Father. Any spirit of destruction, we break it in the name of Jesus Christ. We desire you to have the liberty and the preminence, Father, as we commit oursel to you. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen and amen. The church says, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ this morning. &gt;&gt; Good to be in the house of the Lord. There's no better place to be than to be in the house of the Lord this morning. Amen. I uh welcome you and I greet you each and every one of you individually. Amen. Now I just stood at the door there greeting most of the most of you just just good to see you. Good to see you. Good to see you. God bless you. So baby, God bless you. Good to see you. Brother Victor is on the way. He's there. Perfect. God bless you, man. And uh yeah guys there just uh go to the word of God and u thank you brother Andrew. Thank you musician sister Wendy and and brother Gallup. Um, sister Katy, I would like that song at the end if possible as go through the word of God. You just see that it's in line of what I've prepared for this morning. Can just sing for us one more time. 1 Corinthians 13 1 to 1 to 13. It's good to have the full house. If you start competing for the place for the place and seats, that will be good. So come early and I want to keep my spot there and then that should be good. No, no leaving bags. So it has to be my wife likes to leave a bag there for a placement. You have to come early. So first Corinthians chapter 13 and then verse one. Last time we we went through the 12 which was the gift and brotherly love. Now we go to 13. But before go to 13 if you have your just go to just go to 12 12 31st and then we go 13 because just continuation says but covered earnestly the best gift and yet show I unto you a more excellent way and the more excellent way that was going next time the next chapter said though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels angels and have not charity, I am become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol. And though I have the gift of prophecy and I understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all faith so that I could remove mountains and I have not charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and and though I give my body to be burned burned and I have not charity, it profitth me nothing. You realize that all those things are not bad things very good thing and actually very challenging things but even though you come to do them but if you don't have charity to profit us you nothing. And I say, "Charity suffereth long and is kind. Charity envieth not. Charity wantth not itself. Is not puffed up. Does not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not our own, is not easily provoked, thinkketh no evil, rejoice not in iniquity, but rejoice in the truth." The charity beareth all things, believers all things. It hope all things, endureth all things. The charity never fails. And whether there be prophecies, they shall fail. Whether there be tongues, they shall cease. Whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. When I was a child, I spoke as a child. I understood as a child. I thought as a child, but when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now, we see through a glass darkly. But when but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then shall I know even as I am, as also I am known. And now by the faith, hope, charity, these three, but the greatest of these three is charity. &gt;&gt; Amen. May God bless his word and you can have your seat. That's a wonderful chapter and don't we don't want to have time to go through all of this and but just a wonderful chapter to meditate and to see God this maturity come to that maturity that has those characteristics that's what we desire. Amen. First good news for the church and congratulations to P Marcel and and and my master. They have now a new girl in the family. So let's give them a hand. Fistio congratulations. Now the brother goian is married. &gt;&gt; He's not a single anymore. He's married. So we we we thank God for that. We have potentially a new member in the church through the work of brother Gosian. So that's good. Just pray for them and the the the application goes fast for her to come and all the different things that it's it's painful. Now that you are married one day counts like one year. So it takes long for you. For for those who are not married, they say oh no it's just six months but when you are married those six months it's like sisters I can tell right sisters we went through that as well to reply my wife to come it was forever that six months eight months was just like a little eternity but we thank God for that we are happy looks relaxed and good and that's good and sister naturally she's happy there and God bless so richly. So we we are so happy for them &gt;&gt; and we want him to come back as soon as possible as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. Um I'd like to speak this morning about the about love naturally and obviously the capstone love and there's a title I gave it um love never fails and the old English it says charity never failth. So love never fails and this love that you are talking about is not um is not charity in the sense that the world charity has become these days charity like doing good works and things although it's part of it although it's included in it but it's a agapa love it the love of God himself it self-giving it unconditional love sacrificial love it's a love that God that man cannot just reproduce produced by himself. It's the love of God that God has put in the heart of a of a human being. And that what we have described that is described there. It's the love and the love of God. Amen. It's more than the filio love. It's more than the brotherly love. It's more than than than just affections. It's it's way beyond that. As the Bible says, I give you I give you a better way, excellent way, which is the love of God himself in the heart of men. Amen. And that's what we desire. It's a topic that almost everybody knows but I don't think that we have arrived there yet. And that's what important to have. And no one can create it in another person's heart. It's just yourself. As you stay in the channel, as you stay in the word of God, as you stay in prayer, as you hear the word of God, that loves is being increased automatically. And it goes and it goes. It's the same way as is it just a relationship. The same way that in the natural sometimes is a type the natural is a shadow of the of the spiritual in the natural as as you go into marriage relationship the more you talk the more you fellowship the more you communicate and that love just increase increasing and increasing it's a little bit of type of the spiritual as well is the more you stay in that relationship the more the more you communicate the more you in that channel God is just going to feed and fill your heart with more of his love and more of his love. The more you have the love of God, the more victorious you become. You can't become in this last age. You cannot become victorious without the perfect love of God in your heart. And it's important to have the perfect love of God. Give me more of your love. Give me more of your love beyond you men understanding comprehension. I just want the love of God in my heart more than anything else. Amen. The Bible says in John 4:16, it says, "We have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love, and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth dwelleth in God and God in him." So I would say that God is love. The identity of God is love himself. You want to know God, you have to know love. The more you know love, you know God. Amen. It's something that is abstract, something that you can't touch, something but it is manifest. It's real. The love of God is real. The Holy Ghost brings more of more the love of God inside of you because the Holy Ghost is God and the Holy Ghost expresses himself through the love the love. Amen. The love of God. You can't pretend to know God if there is no love in your heart. Amen. As John 4:8 says, "He that loveth not, not not knoweth not, he that loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is love." So I'll say this morning, my prayer is that Lord, give me more of your love. Because if I have more of your love, then I know you more. Amen. You might know the scriptures about God, but if you don't have the love of God, you don't know God yet. Amen. In order to know God, you need to know his love. I love that song. You don't you know nothing until you know the love of God. You know nothing. You might think that you know but it's just intellectual knowledge. But until the perfect love of God comes into your heart then you start really walk with God then something really has touch your heart. When you have that love of God in your heart amen. And that love of God I'll say it's not a theory. It's just it's a reality. It's God himself. And that's what we desire in our heart. I'll say the whole plan of redemption is based upon love. The whole plan of redemption is based upon love. Because God's love is not the redemption story is not is not a story of of pity. It's not even a story of mercy. It's not just me story like because mercy is something that you you you you find out yourself into it and then you say okay I have to express mercy and I forgive you because something has happened. the God the redemption love is not is not the redemption of of I say not even of mercy it's a redemption of of grace or love I'll explain that a little more because grace grace started way beyond the foundation of the world the love of God did not start during time is not a re the love of God is not a reactive love it's not because you fell and then God start loving you in order to save you no it's not because you have start doing something then God say oh because you are doing this now. I love you. No. God's love started way before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; He loved you way before the foundation of the world. And he chose you way before the foundation of the world. Amen. So God's love is not a reactive love. God's love is the love is God that is unconditional. Is the love of God is supreme. Is is is sovereign. The love of God. So God loves you from before the foundation of the world. Nothing can take you out of the love of God. No circumstances, no situations and nothing can separate you from the love of God because if God loved you, he loved you way before the foundation of the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; So this love is not reactive and and the prophet has as is trying to establish the church, the mature church. So no, salvation is not you are saved today and you are lost tomorrow. Salvation is not I do better things then God start loving me and then God start expressing more his love towards me. No, you can't do nothing better in order for you God to love you more. No, he already loved you way before the foundation of the world. Now you have just to channel yourself into that love of God. And the more you understand the love of God, less fear you will have. Amen. Why we have a lot of fear? Why we have a lot of uncertainty? because we have not understood very well the love of God. And I believe maybe we might not understand it in the fullness in this in this in this part of the world. Maybe not. But the more we understand it, the more realize it, the more it become real to us, I believe more faith we have, more mo more certainty we have. Amen. The more it become a reality. The prophet would say when love is projected. When love is projected, divine sovereign grace of God takes a hold. See when love is projected, divine grace take its place and helps it. When love fileth in that color girl's heart, it's talking about and the love of the opposome you know that story. The love of that opposum to her babies, divine grace to an animal sent to the place for a prayer of delivery. If divine grace will act that way upon an animal, what will it be to a human being who will consecrate themselves to divine love of the love of the Lord Jesus Christ and has recognized him? Amen. So the love the principle I want to make is just as as as a reminder as a repetition of what I already said one time said when the love of God is project then divine grace takes over. Amen. So there is first love of God and then there is divine grace and then divine grace there is election. Amen. So you are elected because of the grace of God and you have the grace of God because you have the love of God. So first they start with the love of God. So that's why I'm saying the love of God is not reactive. The love of God is active. Amen. God loved you first and that's why and when he projected his love then grace came into place took over and then when grace took over then election took over. Amen. You are elected by the love or by the grace of God through the love of God. And under that experience if the aposum expressed projected that love and it was healing for the little baby the prophet says how much more should be for a Christian when a Christian project the love of God that the grace of God will take over. Amen. &gt;&gt; So what we have as a Christian or as a believer it's to express and to project more of the love of God. I thank God that the capstone did not come. The capstone did not come and say work, work, work, work. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful that the capstone came and say grace, grace, grace, grace to the bride. &gt;&gt; Thank God for the grace in my life. Thank God for the love of God in my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. It gives me certainty. It gives me stability. No, it's I'm not depending on myself. I depend on the grace of God. I depend on THE LOVE OF GOD. AMEN. BUT DEEP INSIDE of my heart, I WILL DO MY BEST. AMEN. BUT I'M I'M NOT depending on my works. I'm depending on the grace of God. Praise be to God. Election is God's grace. God's grace the projection of God's love. So it started God's love. Love lifted me. As the song says, love lifted me. No one could lift me up. No one could take me in the position where I am. But thank God the plan God was not taken by surprise. He knew before the foundation of the world all the shortcuts will make all the stumblers all the falls and but all through that still God's love will be there to lift you up. AMEN. &gt;&gt; TO TAKE YOU OVER THAT TO MAKE YOU CROSS OVER because God can't lose you. That's why he put that unconditional love, unconditional grace, unconditional covenant. AMEN. GOD, GIVE US MORE REVELATION to understand your love towards us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To mature Christians, the meaning of God's life is way beyond the natural things. As the prophet says in the exposition 7 church age, he says, "The cloudy skies and the storms of life are no signs of God's approval. Neither are bright skies and still waters signs of his love and approval. His approval of any of us is only in the beloved. So the approval is not based on the circumstances of why this is happening. Why this happening? Maybe God does not love me. No, it's not based on that. That's that a denominational conception. That a catholic conception. That's wrong. I mean, you might go up, you might go down, you might go up, you might go down. Things might go bad, things might go good, but that does not depend on the love. That's not the sign of the love of of God or disapproval of God. Your approval, my approval is in the beloved. Amen. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY GOD HELP US TO GO IN THE inner behind the inner because there we don't depend on circumstances. We are we are we are sound we are sound how do you say soundproof &gt;&gt; soundproof from the things of the noise of the outside you are inner there in relationship with God I want to know you more I want the love of God to be EXPRESSED TO ME MORE LORD I DON'T WANT TO DEPEND on the circumstances on the weather and things of the smoke of even in in the holy center I for the smoke depending on ON THE NATURAL LIGHT NO LORD I WANT THE SHINE IN A GLORY TO SHINE UPON ME. THE LOVE OF GOD, &gt;&gt; MAKE ME GO INTO THE CAPSTONE LOVE. LORD, LET ME HAVE A REVELATION OF THE CAPSTONE LOVE. LORD, because you loved me before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; It says his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world. Does he love us? He says, "Ah, yes." But how shall we know? We shall know because he said so. Amen. And he manifested that he did love us for because because for he brought us to himself and he gave us of his spirit. That's the proof that God loved us. He brought us to himself. &gt;&gt; You didn't bring yourself to God. God brought you to himself. He brought you to himself and he gave you the Holy Spirit. As I SAID MANY TIMES, NO ONE can give you the Holy Spirit. No preacher can give you THIS HOLY SPIRIT. NO PARENT CAN GIVE YOU THE HOLY SPIRIT. No matter how much they LOVE YOU. ONLY GOD CAN GIVE YOU THE HOLY SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; AREN'T YOU THANKFUL WHEN THAT GOD gives you the Holy Spirit, not because you couldn't give it yourself the Holy Spirit, but by God's grace, God gives you the Holy Spirit. You have a desire for him. You have a desire to serve him. You have desire to BE FAITHFUL TO HIM. NO ONE COULD GIVE YOU THAT. ONLY GOD COULD GIVE YOU THAT. THANK GOD FOR THAT THIRST IN MY HEART. THANK GOD FOR THAT THIRST IN YOUR heart for more of God. And he didn't stop there. Says what is what did he manifest his love? Says he brought us to himself and he gave us of his spirit and he placed us as sons. He brings us to adoption. Amen. In this age is not only to stop on the justification. Not only stop on the sanctification. can't even stop on the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the flesh or on the mind even the baptism EVEN THE NEW BIRTH. But then now the for the age we have TO GO ALL THE WAY TO ADOPTION. &gt;&gt; GOD BRINGS YOU TO ADOPTION. THANK GOD. HE HAS PREDESTINATED YOU. He has predestined me to into adoption. AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH LORD, THANK GOD FOR YOUR GRACE. &gt;&gt; How shall I prove my love to him? The question, how shall I prove my love to him? By believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass. Sometimes he allows trials, but my attitude towards the love of God that expressed to me is just to live with joy, conduct myself with joy among those trials. Brothers and sisters, this capstone love goes beyond being a millionaire or billionaire. &gt;&gt; It goes beyond that. AMEN. LOOK WHY THE PROPHET IS TAKING inspiration to tell her that with the approval of any of us is in the beloved. He's taking that inspiration from the Bible in Ephesians 1 3:6. If you listen what Ephesians 1, the book of adoption is telling us, blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who blessed us with all spiritual blessings. &gt;&gt; He blessed us not with some spiritual blessings. No, but brother Gilbert said it one time so well. It says he blessed us way beyond the blessings only of becoming rich. &gt;&gt; Although we want all to become rich. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Only few people accept to be rich. Wow. Okay. I want to be rich though. Pastor, you say that this year blessings. &gt;&gt; My wife want me to become rich. So, &gt;&gt; I think she needs to go to Sunday school. She distract me a lot when I'm preaching. Why don't you realize that I've mentioned her a lot? That's not good. Now I lost where I was. &gt;&gt; Yes. For he has blessed us with all spiritual blessings. ALL SPIRITUAL BLESSINGS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE EMPHASIS. GOD, THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME ALL the spiritual blessings. &gt;&gt; YOU NEED HEALING IS PART OF THE SPIRITUAL BLESSINGS. YOU NEED RESTORATION IS PART OF THE SPIRITUAL BLESSING. YOU NEED THE JOY OF SALVATION. IT'S PART OF THE SPIRITUAL BLESSINGS. IT'S NOT A PARTIAL BLESSINGS BUT ALL SPIRITUAL BLESSINGS. WE ARE APPROVED IN THE BELOVED. AMEN. IT SAYS HE has bless spiritual in heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation OF THE WORLD. WHERE WERE YOU CHOSEN? IN CHRIST. WHEN BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. NOT WHEN YOU TOOK YOUR BAPTISM, NOT WHEN YOU REPENTED, not when you you even got the baptism OF THE HOLY GHOST. NO, YOU WERE CHOSEN IN HIM WAY BEFORE the foundation of the world. SO, YOUR WALK SHOULD NOT BE A WALK OF FEAR. Like I said on Wednesday, it's not a walk of a servant. It's not a walk of begging. NO, IT'S A WALK OF A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD. YOU REALIZE WHO YOU ARE. YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE A SON OF AND A DAUGHTER OF THE KING. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR YOUR GRACE IN MY LIFE. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THAT LOVE, I DID NOT LOVE YOU. YOU LOVED me first. &gt;&gt; Oh my. It says, "And a heavenly place in Christ according chosen before from that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of the children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he had made us accepted in the beloved." WHY? BECAUSE WHY DID HE GET ACCEPTED IN THE BELOVED? for the praise of the glory of his grace. God like to praise his own grace is his sovereign grace. It means he give that grace to who he wants. And from all the millions of the people that on the earth, God chose you and me. &gt;&gt; Amazing grace. How rich is that amazing grace? Amen. I was blind but now I can see. I was A WRETCHED BUT NOW HE FOUND ME. HE SHOWS ME. AMEN. LIKE DAVID, HE TOOK ME FROM THE PLACE I WAS AND HE MADE ME A KING. AMEN. IN HIS KINGDOM. THANK GOD FOR YOUR GRACE. WHAT LOVE. WHAT A MARVELOUS LOVE. WE CAN NEVER DESCRIBE the love of God with our human mind, with our human lips, with our human language. The love of God is way beyond than we can understand. &gt;&gt; Why can I what can I say here? The capstone love is not only to make you have a good life. maybe sometimes but the capstone is not only to make you a former nominal Christians although it is good. The capstone is not only to make you justified or good or sanctified although it is good but it also go way beyond to be born again to be filled with the Holy Ghost and to have all the virtue and then to place you as sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; The capstone comes for the adoption. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you read the message, the statue of the perfect man, it might look like the prophet is calling it as the Holy Spirit. It's actually the Holy Spirit. Thank God for the Holy Spirit. But the Holy Spirit in our time places us into adoption. The Holy Spirit in our time doesn't stop at the faith level. The Holy Spirit in our time doesn't stop at the virtue level. The Holy Spirit doesn't even stop at the brotherly kindness level. IT COMES ALL THE WAY TO THE ADOPTION. AMEN. You have THE HOLY GHOST THEN YOU ARE PREDESTINATED TO ADOPTION in this age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what if God want to establish with Israel but Israel did not understand the grace of God. He told Israel in Deuteronomy 7 says the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people restored word fellowship. He did not choose you because you are the greatest of all the churches in number and everything. No. Even though small as you are, God's love is upon you. &gt;&gt; God put his love upon you. Amen. He's watching over you. HE TAKES CARE OF YOU. HE'S A GREAT SHEPHERD OVER YOU. AMEN. BECAUSE HIS LOVE IS UPON YOU. If his love IS UPON YOU, NO ONE CAN SEPARATE you from the love OF GOD. WHEN PAUL REALIZED THAT SAYS, "OH, I REALIZE THAT NOTHING CAN separate me from the love of God." Whether it is tribulation, persecution, NAKEDNESS, WHATEVER THIS MEAN, POVERTY OR OR WE WELFARE, WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE, NOTHING CAN SEPARATE ME FROM THE LOVE OF GOD. IT'S NOT A REACTIVE LOVE. IT IS ELECTIVE LOVE WAY BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. IF HE LOVED ME THERE, HE CAN'T CHANGE HIS LOVE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD DOES NOT HAVE ANOTHER OPTION. HE DOES NOT HAVE A PLAN B FOR YOU. HE ONLY HAVE A PLAN A. AND THAT'S THAT'S THE ONLY PLAN. &gt;&gt; He will do everything. HE WILL SHAKE HEAVEN AND EARTH FOR YOU NOT TO BE LOST. AMEN. &gt;&gt; If he loved you. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; JACOB MAYBE DID NOT UNDERSTAND. HE'S GOING THROUGH ALL those trials and doesn't UNDERSTAND WHY WHY WHY. I WAS JUST LISTENING TO JACOB and then God CAME AND SAID, "JACOB, I HAVE LOVED YOU. I HAVE ELECTED YOU. YOUR SEED SHALL POSSESS THIS LAND, JACOB. &gt;&gt; OH, EVEN IN THE MIDST OF LABAN WHO'S PERSECUTED ME." YES, JACOB, I STILL LOVE YOU. MY BLESSING IS UPON YOU. I CAN'T CHANGE MY BLESSING. &gt;&gt; I CAN'T CHANGE MY MIND. I CAN'T CHANGE MY IDEA UPON YOU. &gt;&gt; I LOVED YOU BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. AMEN. SOMETIMES YOU LOOK AT YOURSELF FOR SITUATIONS. Does really God loves me? Oh, look at Esau. He is many. HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S PROSPEROUS. OH, JACOB, YOU ARE LOVED. &gt;&gt; RESTORED WORD FELLOWSHIP. YOU ARE LOVED, MY GOD. &gt;&gt; I PUT MY LOVE UPON YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; For you are the fewest of all people. But because the Lord loved you and because you will keep the oath which he had swn unto your fathers. Thank God for his love. God's love is not is the cause of our salvation. &gt;&gt; He's the cause of our redemption. &gt;&gt; God's love is not is not the the result of what we have done. &gt;&gt; It's not the result of what Israel did. No, it's not the result of what Abraham did. No, God's love was the cause, was the origin, WAS THE ALPHA, AND IT IS THE OMEGA. NOW, &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY IT STARTED WITH GOD'S LOVE, IS ENDING WITH GOD'S LOVE. &gt;&gt; IT START WITH GOD'S GRACE IS ENDING WITH GOD'S GRACE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; All is about God's grace. God is the one who draws you first. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then you respond to his drawing. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not YOU COMING. LORD GOD, I've been looking for you. I've been searching for you. No, NO, NO, NO. GOD HAS BEEN SEARCHING FOR YOU ALL THE TIME. &gt;&gt; HE PUT THAT DESIRE. HE PUT THAT HOOK INSIDE OF YOU. NO MATTER WHERE YOU WERE, HE WAS JUST DRAWING YOU. He was drawing you. He was drawing you. If God has already elected you, there is no way you can escape. NO MATTER WHAT IS YOUR PAST, NO MATTER WHERE YOU WENT THROUGH, no matter HOW THE FLESH, THE MIND HAS BEEN CORRUPTED. THANK GOD FOR THE SEED OF GOD INSIDE OF YOU. IT CAN NEVER BE CORRUPTED. GOD WILL DRAW YOU BACK TO HIM. AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, NOW THE BRIDE KNOWS WHERE WHO SHE IS. SHE'S STANDING NOW ON THE ON ON ON THE FOUNDATION OF GRACE. AMEN. SHE'S NOT BEEN STUMBLING. SHE'S NOT BEEN GOING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. OH, I MADE A MISTAKE NOW. NOW I'M LOST. NO. AMEN. YOU YOU MAKE A MISTAKE. YOU STAND UP. &gt;&gt; THANK GOD I MADE A MISTAKE, BUT YOU GAVE ME A DESIRE TO STAND UP. I STILL WANT TO GO BACK TO CHURCH. I STILL WANT TO READ THE WORD OF GOD. I STILL WANT TO PRAY, LORD. I DON'T FEEL LIKE DOING IT, BUT STILL SOMETHING INSIDE OF ME IS PUSHING ME, LORD. I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT SERVING THE LORD. &gt;&gt; WHO DID THAT? GOD DID THAT. PUT INSIDE OF YOU. &gt;&gt; Others are indifferent. They don't feel it. THEY DON'T FEEL THAT TAG ANYMORE. BUT YOU STILL FEEL IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHY ARE WE STRUGGLING? BECAUSE WE ARE PART OF GOD. THERE'S SOMETHING INSIDE IS FIGHTING THE FLESH. THE FLESH IS TELLING YOU YOU ARE NOT WORTHY. BUT INSIDE SOMETHING SAYS YOU ARE WORTHY. &gt;&gt; But other PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THEY DON'T FEEL THAT CONFLICT ANYMORE. THEY DON'T FEEL THAT CONFLICT. AMEN. REMEMBER THE THE white dog and the black dog. &gt;&gt; Amen. Some people only HAVE THE BLACK DOG. &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT THERE IS A WHITE DOG &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT WHITE DOG IS SO DEAD. &gt;&gt; BUT THANK GOD THAT I STILL HAVE THAT WHITE DOG. I FIGHT WITH THE BLACK DOG, BUT I FEED THE WHITE DOG. THE WHITE DOG TAKES OVER. LORD, THE INNER MAN IS GETTING IS GROWING. THANK GOD FOR THAT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Let's put the DEVIL A LITTLE BIT DOWN. &gt;&gt; DEVIL, YOU ARE DEFEATED. I'M A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD. &gt;&gt; I'VE BEEN FOR THEN PREDESTINATED TO LIFE. SEE, God love God loved Israel from the very beginning. &gt;&gt; And he says with all Israel, he says, "The Lord has appeared of old unto me and said, "Yeah, I have loved thee with an everlasting love. Therefore, with loving kindness have I drawn thee." God's love is everlasting. IS ETERNAL. AMEN. BEFORE YOU EVEN RESPONDED, &gt;&gt; he already loved you. &gt;&gt; God draws you. As I said, he he loved you be HE LOVED YOU BEFORE YOU RESPONDED. GOD LOVED even when his people when when sometimes you rebelled against him. He still LOVED YOU. GOD'S LOVE PRECEDED YOUR OBEDIENCE TO THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Sometimes you say, "No, I I did not obey, so God doesn't love me." NO, GOD STILL LOVES YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE MIGHT GET TO THAT PART. Maybe you NEED TO OBEY MORE. BUT GOD STILL LOVED YOU. EVEN IN YOUR DISOBEDIENCE, GOD STILL LOVED YOU. HE DID NOT LOVE YOU WHEN YOU BECAME A VERY good Christian. NO, NOW YOU REALIZE IT. OH, all this time I've been mistreating him. Oh God, forgive me, Lord. That's why we repent because that love struck you. Oh, how come I've been mistreating the one who loved me more than anything else? Sometimes I put priority or the love of my friends and different things of I I I I I gave them priority before God. But now you realize, oh the love of God has always been there. He was there waiting for you. &gt;&gt; Like that father waiting for the prodigal son. &gt;&gt; He's waiting for you every time. Every time. The love for the father did no change. &gt;&gt; He's still waiting for him. I know he's going to COME BACK. &gt;&gt; NOW OUR SPIRITUAL FATHER. AMEN. WHERE WE COME FROM. WE THE LOWEST PLACE like I was listening to one brother says the lowest place you can go as a son of God the lowest place you can go the lowest place you can go you CAN GO NO MATTER HOW GO YOU WANT TO GO you can never become a pig even if you eat with the pig even if YOU YOU STAY THERE AND SLEEP WITH THE PIG YOU CAN NEVER BECOME A PIG NO MATTER WHAT YOU ARE STILL A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD EVEN IN THAT DIRTY LIFE YOU ARE STILL A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD. ONE TIME THE LOVE OF GOD WILL COME AND PICK YOU UP FROM THERE. YOU COME BACK TO YOURSELF SAY WHAT AM I DOING HERE? MY FATHER OWNS SO MANY THINGS. WHY AM I STAYING HERE IN THE PIG HERE? LET ME GO BACK TO MY FATHER. IF THE LOVE OF GOD BRING YOU BACK TO HIM, GLORY TO HIS NAME. &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR HIS LOVE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That's the grace of God in our lives. &gt;&gt; GOD'S LOVE PRECEDE YOUR OBEDIENCE. GOD LOVE loves you before maturity, before faithfulness, before even understanding. That's why he says charity never fails. &gt;&gt; GOD'S LOVE NEVER FAILS. WHY HE CAN'T FAIL? BECAUSE HE'S THE ONE WHO STARTED IT. &gt;&gt; HE'S THE ONE WHO INITIATED IT. IT'S NOT ME who initiated. IT'S NOT YOU INITIATE IT. IF YOU INITIATE IT, YOU WILL FALL. IF I INITIATE IT, I WILL FALL. BUT THANK GOD, WHEN IT'S HIM WHO INITIATED, &gt;&gt; WHEN IT'S HIM WHO START SOMETHING, OH GOD, HE STARTED THE WALK WITH ABRAHAM. &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM, I start the walk with you. &gt;&gt; I have blessed you, ABRAHAM. &gt;&gt; WHAT HAVE I DONE? NOTHING. BUT I STILL LOVE you and I've chosen you and I've blessed you and I'm starting a WALK WITH YOU. AMEN. NOW THAT I'VE STARTED WITH YOU, YOU CAN NEVER BE LOST. ABRAHAM, YOU WILL GO HERE. SOMETIMES YOU GO BACK AND YOU GO DIFFERENT PLACES, BUT AS A GPS, YOU WILL GO TO THE FINAL DESTINATION. ABRAHAM, &gt;&gt; YOU WILL NOT BE LOST. ABRAHAM, &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHAT THE ENEMY WILL COME, NO MATTER SODOM AND GOMORRAH, YOU WILL NEVER BE DEFEATED. ABRAHAM, &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM, YOU WILL FIGHT AGAINST THOSE KINGS OF SOD OF THOSE WHO TOOK of those WHO TOOK LOT. YOU ARE NOT A SOLDIER, BUT BECAUSE I CHOSEN YOU, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE DEFEATED. LOVE WILL NEVER FAIL. AMEN. LOVE WILL ALWAYS HAVE THE VICTORY. AND HE BROUGHT HIM BACK. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND YOU ARE THE ROYAL SEED OF ABRAHAM. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE PART OF THAT PROMISE. YOU ARE PART OF THAT VICTORY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN NEVER BE LOST AS GOD CAN NEVER BE LOST. &gt;&gt; Glory to his name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans 5:8 says, "But God commanded his love towards us in that while we were yet sinners, CHRIST DIED FOR US." BEFORE YOU WERE BORN, HE DIED FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; The solution was there before the problem. &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES WE THINK THIS, OH, THIS IS A NEW PROBLEM. NO, THE SOLUTION WAS ALREADY THERE BEFORE THE PROBLEM ARISES. SO, WHO IS STRONGER? IS IT THE PROBLEM OR THE SOLUTION? THE SOLUTION IS STRONGER BECAUSE IT WAS THERE BEFORE THE PROBLEM CAME. AMEN. &gt;&gt; The problem comes only to manifest that the solution was there. &gt;&gt; If there was no problem, YOU WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE GOD IN THOSE ATTRIBUTES. BUT NOW BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEM, YOU RECOGNIZE HIM. SO, OH THANK GOD YOU ARE THE HEALER. &gt;&gt; THANK GOD YOU RESTORED MY FAMILY. THANK GOD YOU SAVED ME. THANK GOD YOU GAVE ME THE HEALING POWER. THANK GOD YOU GAVE ME THE HOLY SPIRIT TO LIVE IN THE TIME OF LARIA. AMEN. YOU CANNOT DO BY YOURSELF, BUT GOD GAVE YOU THE VICTORY. &gt;&gt; I WOULD SAY THANK GOD FOR THE CONDITIONS OF LARIA. IT'S SHOWING WHAT GOD HAS PUT INSIDE OF US. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT THIS BRIDE CAN NEVER FAIL. WHY SHE CAN'T FAIL? SHE HAS RECEIVED GOD HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; SHE HAS RECEIVED THE LOVE OF GOD. CHARITY CAN NEVER FAIL. AMEN. OH my &gt;&gt; first John 4:10 SAYS F WHEREIN IS LOVE not that we loved God but that he loved us and he sent his son to be the propitiation of our sins. &gt;&gt; So this redemption salvation is grounded is rooted in God's action not in our action. Redemption is rooted IN GOD'S WHAT GOD HAS DONE FOR US not what we have done for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the spirit as I went the prophet prophet said exposition seven churches as in verse 11 the spirit boldly calls out for the children not being born neither having done any good of evil that the purpose of God according to the election might stand not of works but of him that calleth. His love is elective. It is his love for his elect and his love for them is apart from human merit. For it says that the purpose of God stands in election which is exactly opposite works on anything man has in himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because before the children were born he had already said Jacob have I loved and Esau have I HATED. BEFORE THEY'VE DONE anything grace was already there. &gt;&gt; Election was already there. So that the the purpose of God shall stand. God called you. I share that quote. God called you for a purpose. God called you for a reason. YOU MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND IT. YOU MIGHT NOT NOT EAT IN FULLNESS. But there is a reason &gt;&gt; BECAUSE DESPITE ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE, HE HAS chosen you. Why me? Why me, Lord? Usually we use that in the wrong way. This has happened to me. Why me? Why me? But I'll put it in in a good way. From all these things, why me, Lord? Why? Why only me? Since some of us only one person in that family, the whole family is still struggling. You we still praying for them. We and by God's grace be but for the longest time maybe in life you you have been there yourself only you why they can't see it. Why they CAN'T SEE IT? WHY THEY CAN'T SEE IT? WHY ME LORD? WHY? I'm not the intellectual one. I'm not I'm not the the the sharp one, the sharpest one. I have no quality on my own. BUT WHY ME? WHY ME? GOD'S GRACE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; First John 4:19 says, "I love him because he first love us." &gt;&gt; Now it goes the other part. Now I love him &gt;&gt; because he first loved me. &gt;&gt; If you have the revelation of the love of God, it has to produce a love back. How what how can't you love someone who died for you &gt;&gt; in the natural? How can't you love someone who paid your debt? &gt;&gt; You're struggling. You're struggling. Struggling sometimes. I think it happened to me one time. I went to, you know, Walmart can just stop you for one cent. No, you're not letting me sense. I think I came from Europe but I mean you sense really no I can't let you pass oh mama I paid 100 now sense is missing you can't let me no and someone just comes you know it's okay I'll pay for that oh thank you thank you thank you thank you if for one sense I'm thanking you thank you thank you how much more for all my sins for all MY PAST AND FOR ALL MY GOD HAS PUT THAT IN THE SEA OF FORGETFULNESS AND NOT TO REMEMBER THEM ANYMORE. HOW THANKFUL SHOULD I BE LORD? THANK GOD FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IN MY LIFE. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; I love you because you first loved me. &gt;&gt; That's why I say how shall I prove my love to him? by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass. Sometimes he might allow some trials but for a purpose to show his glory to show his power is not to bring frustration. It's not the order of frustration but even in those trials just show the right attitude. Thank God for THE VICTORY. THANK GOD FOR YOUR LOVE. THANK YOU GOD FOR THE DELIVERANCE. KEEP CONFESSING POSITIVE. IN THE CHRISTIANITY, THERE IS NO NEGATIVITY. DON'T SAY, "OH, NO, I'm here. Why this? Oh, no. CURSE ME THE DAY OF MY BIRTH." AND NO, NO. THANK GOD FOR YOUR GRACE. THANK GOD FOR THE MESSAGE. THANK GOD FOR SALVATION. THANK GOD FOR ETERNITY THAT IS WAITING FOR ME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And now you start expressing your love towards him. You start serving him. You did not love Yeah. I did not love you because that God says I did not love you because of your works. I did not love you because of your works. Now you have that revelation. Now you say God now God want to say because you realize that love inside of me. Now I want you also to love me unconditionally. Now you start loving God unconditionally too. Say no Lord I'm not loving you only when you give me a job. &gt;&gt; Whether job or not job but God I still love you Lord. Now it's you manifesting the love to God unconditionally. Lord, am I have this? I might not have this. I still love you, Lord. &gt;&gt; People might love me, but they might not love me. I still love you, Lord. &gt;&gt; This might happen, this might not happen. I still love you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It's my time to express my unconditional love towards you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, make your love more real inside of me because agapa love is unconditional. Now we want that agapa love to be inside of us to love him unconditionally. &gt;&gt; Sometimes even to love our brother and our sister unconditionally. It's not because they did this to me now I have to love it. They didn't do that. No, you don't re it's not a reactive love. That was a brotherly love. It is STILL IMPORTANT BROTHER BUT UNCONDITIONAL LOVE. I GOT POWER LOVE IS UNCONDITIONAL. I will still love you no matter what. I want your salvation. That will be my purpose. I want your salvation. You have to be your purpose. You want my salvation. Amen. Amen. And the prophet will simplify it in very well. I like the way he simplified. And I'll just read the way he simplified where it knocks the prophets out of the legal list. Say yes sir. In adoption tree says but brother let me tell you it's not by works but by grace are we saved that by faith. Yes sir. I won't condemn legalist brethren. They are my brothers and they'll be there just the same as any of the rest of them will be there because God has for Danny's church to be there. But just the thing you keep the people so to up they don't know what today maybe well maybe I uh you know because you you you shake their ground you am I saved really don't leave them there. &gt;&gt; Thank God for the message of the hour. He didn't leave us there. So no sometimes it can be hard. It can be mom says you know let's sing more songs. I know the message was sharp because he doesn't want to leave the bride there. So no you you I I told you so hard things because I love you. I don't want I don't I don't want you to lose your privilege living as a Christian but I'm not preaching this for you to feel like you are condemned that you can't make it. No I I just want you to live as a Christian as a son and daughter of God. BUT STAND UP. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; So just let them know as long as they got the hang of the world, they're not they are not there to begin with. But I don't leave now it says the power of life. I don't live true to my wife because I think she will divorce me. I live true to my wife because I love her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a legal position that we have taken that we love one another. Amen. First before it could be there I had to be a love. I love her. Although I believe if I done something wrong, she will forgive me. Still, I wouldn't do it anyhow. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you love your wife. You are not living under under fear. If I do this, she will divorce me. If I if I do this or she will go away. If you are in that state, it's a you need grace. You need come and see the pastor &gt;&gt; because that's not good. Living under fear. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. You you are relaxed. Sometimes we become too relaxed. Where is he going to go in here? That's not the attitude. I'm probably put a balance. Is it okay? Love is boiling. You you you know you know you know I'll just put my own examples. I don't put you know when when I was in courtship I did so many things. I bought so many skirts. Oh my goodness. So many things and things and her because I wanted to impress her, impress her, impress her, impress her. And then when she got hooked, that's it. I kind of reduced a little bit. Someone says not good, right? That's where I was going. Yeah, that's that's not good. But I kind of reduced a little bit. But let me tell you that works that I started it took her. All right, I have to express my love towards her. But let me tell you once I got married, I have worked more &gt;&gt; than when I was in courtship. &gt;&gt; I've worked more for her, I've done greater things that if there was no love, if the things I'm doing after being married, if I did that in courtship, I would have given up because no, right? Maybe I was too selfish, right? You know, boy, you are too proud of yourself and but marriage kinds of makes you a little bit humble and understanding and everything. Now the love has become mature. But I've done more being married than when I was in courtship because I love her more. That's the same thing for the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. So when you are married, when the love of God is expressed in your heart, you love him more. You even do things way more than if it was under the law. You have to do this. You have to do this. You have to do this. You have to do this. You have to do this. Oh, no. God, I don't want to be in that stage where I feel like it's a burden. When it's a duty, when they're forcing me, WE ARE PUSHING ME. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. I WANT IT TO BE LOVE. FATHER, I'M EXPRESSING MY LOVE TO YOU. I'M DOING THINGS BECAUSE I LOVE YOU, LORD. THE PROPHET SAYS, "WHETHER I PREACH OR PREACH, I DON'T PREACH, I'LL STILL BE SAVED." &gt;&gt; AMEN. I WILL STILL BE SAVED AND I KNOW I'LL BE SAVED. BUT BECAUSE I LOVE GOD, I PREACH BECAUSE I LOVE GOD AND I WANT THE PEOPLE OF GOD TO BE SAVED. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES THE ATTITUDE WE HAVE AS A BELIEVERS, YOU KNOW, I will do things for God only if I have a title. If I have do things, OH, BAD BAD BAD START TO BEGIN WITH. NO, LORD, I WILL SERVE YOU NO MATTER WHAT. I'LL BE FAITHFUL NO MATTER WHAT. I WILL GIVE MY ALL NO MATTER WHAT BECAUSE I HAVE A REALIZATION OF THE LOVE OF GOD TOWARDS ME. ONCE YOU HAVE THAT LOVE OF GOD, LET ME TELL YOU, God will put you under adoption. Says now he's thinking like me. Now he has unconditional love. He doesn't do things for pride, for for for for popularity, FOR MONEY, FOR NOW HE'S ENTITLED to become an adopted son, &gt;&gt; an adopted daughter of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was reading Jacob again, listening to Job, Jacob Bible. Jacob loved Rachel. Seven years was like nothing. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Because for the love he had for Rachel. Like nothing. Just if there was no love seven years for Jacob, oh no. Why this? Why is mistreating me like he got Leia? And then they gave him Why did you Why did you deceive me? No, you need another seven years. Oh, no problem. I BECAUSE HE LOVED SO MUCH, RICHARD. NOW, PUT IT IN THE SPIRITUAL. AMEN. GOD, I I I PRAYED FOR THIS AND IT didn't happen this year. Oh, thank God. I WILL STILL LOVE YOU. I'LL STILL SERVE YOU. I'LL STILL BE FAITHFUL IN SMALL THINGS AND IN BIG THINGS. FATHER, EXPRESS MY LOVE TOWARDS YOU BECAUSE FOR ME IT'S NOT A DUTY. IT'S NOT A CHARGE. IT'S NOT FORCING. IT'S NOT IT'S not a It's not IT'S NOT YOU HAVE TO COME TO CHURCH. YOU HAVE NO, NO, LORD. I'M EXPRESSING MY LOVE TOWARDS YOU, LORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Is prayer. Oh God, help us not to be alar. &gt;&gt; Shall I just pray because I have to eat my religious duty? &gt;&gt; Let me just pray a little bit. I feel good like I I'm a Christian. No, no, no, no, no. Prayer is a desire. Father, I just want to say I love you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you for your grace in my life. &gt;&gt; It's good to repeat even things. Amen. &gt;&gt; But as long as it come sincerely from your heart, Lord, I told you yesterday I love you for your grace, your mercy. Today I say again, I love you for your grace and your mercy. Because you loved me first. I LOVE YOU BECAUSE YOU LOVED ME FIRST. &gt;&gt; Thank God for your grace. &gt;&gt; I in the same court. Although I believe I've done something wrong, she'll still forgive me. Still I still I wouldn't do anything anyhow. That's the way it is with Christ. I'm 50. If I leave to be 90 or 100, I have 50 years to preach and never preach a time and go down and sit on the river. I'm saved anyhow. God saved me by his grace unmmerited of anything I ever could do, did do or anything else. I preach because I love him and I love his people. And that's the reason I know I've passed from death onto life because that I love them and I go after them. No matter what kind of condition they are in, I go after them anyhow. Go get them anyhow. Pull them anyhow. If ministers disagree and others disagree, denomination denomination disagree, that don't stop me. That's nothing. I didn't stop him. He didn't stop him. He came right in the midst of unbelief and didn't stop him. He moved right on anyhow. That's what we do. That's what we do. Go out and get them and catch them anyhow. Or the brother doesn't believe anymore and anything or we disagreed and we just lift him. No, you leave him. No, no, no. That's a wrong attitude. Go still after him. Still look for occasion and coffee and anything because you want salvation. You want him to be saved. Don't leave him. Amen. No matter. No matter rich grab. Hold on with all your might. You don't know who they are. Save them. That because that's because of love. Not because that I have to, but because I love because you love. Oh, I ought to make that right with that woman. He says this attitude sometimes we have. I ought to make that right with that woman. But I tell you right now, I guess because I go to church, I ought to make it right because I go to church. Yeah. Like brother Ed used to say, oh, I think took it from Pastor Herald. You know, I I have to go to church on time because I'm the pastor. I'm not on time, it's not good. Yeah. Yeah. So when you're not a pastor, you'll be late. Okay. So I know I have to show that I'm because I'm a preacher. I have to be there. No, it's not the title that makes you think do things wrong attitude. No. Father, help me to be faithful before any title, before anything before. Amen. That's where adoption comes. Even in natural at work, you you it it it's easy to give a job title to someone who's already doing it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Says, "Okay, he's doing this all the time. It's just a title to the title doesn't make him do it. He's already doing it." &gt;&gt; Yeah. You become a manager &gt;&gt; because you're already showing it. &gt;&gt; It's not you you make you a manager then you start. How do you manage people? Hey, &gt;&gt; no, no, no, no, no. Wrong attitude. God says, "I'm going to bring you the adoption. What you need, just love me." &gt;&gt; Brother will simplify the whole message into love God. &gt;&gt; Just love God. &gt;&gt; And that's always my prayer. God, give me more of your love. &gt;&gt; If I really love you, I will do things. I know what I've done because I've loved &gt;&gt; in the natural. I've done great things and things I couldn't think I could do. But when I loved, I just did them easily. The same thing will apply spiritually. If I God gives me just his love, the real love of God, I will do way beyond anything they can do. Say do this, do this, do this, do this, this &gt;&gt; if I just love him. &gt;&gt; So our prayer is to be God, give me more of your love. says you are the one ought says I guess because I go to church I ought to go make it right. No, you are the one ought to get right first. If you haven't got the love of God in your heart, something another makes you know that you are wrong. Something another makes you know that you are wrong. Then you go then you go make it right with God. Then you will make it right with your neighbor. Amen. Jesus said the same thing. If you come to an altar, remember there's an oath against the neighbor or the brother. Go make it right first. Amen. Let me say this. So I'll say you do more under grace and love than under the law. If you don't yield yourself more to God under grace or love, then there is something wrong. That's why Paul could could take that in Romans 6. It says for sin shall not have dominion over you for you are not under the law &gt;&gt; but under grace. &gt;&gt; Oh my. But I thought the law if they says do do then then I will be then sin won't have any dominion over say no that's a wrong Israel failed already. Don't restart what Israel already failed on. No you are under grace now. Because you are under grace sin should not have dominion over you. What shall YOU DO THAT? JUST YIELD TO GOD. GOD, I YIELD MYSELF TO YOU. &gt;&gt; LIKE THE BROTHER sang at the beginning, LORD, I SURRENDER ALL. LORD, I SURRENDER ALL. THE MORE you yield, THE MORE YOU SURRENDER, THE MORE YOU PRAY, THE MORE YOU LOVE HIM, SIN WILL NOT have dominion over you. &gt;&gt; We are living in THE AGE OF PERFECT LOVE. &gt;&gt; This is the bright age. THIS IS OUR AGE. AMEN. FOR YOU AND US to be manifest your sons and daughters of God. What then shall we sin because we are not under the law, but under grace, God forbid? Know ye not that to whom you yield yourself, servants obey, his servant ye are to whom you obey, whether of sin unto death or or obedience unto righteousness. But God be thanked. We say this morning, God be thank ye were servant of sin, but you have obeyed from the heart. That form of doctrine which was delivered unto you. Yes, obedience is still there. You know, you can be obedient under the law. So, you have to do this. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I do that to my kids. I give them they make me reason. They make I'm stuck. So, I say no. Okay. You just have to do this. I don't have any reason. They're still young. I can do that. You just have to do it because I'm stuck as a parent. Now I'm confessing to them. But I just make them do and they do obediently. They do because I have fingers punishment blah blah blah and they just slowly they do. They're obedient. But can I really trust them for adoption with that attitude? No. But one day they will start doing it from their heart. &gt;&gt; It becomes a revelation to them. They have the mind of of their daddy. They know what our daddy thinks. Whether that explain it well or not well, they still catches it. Now they start doing it themsel. It becomes obedience. Still obedience. The same result. Still doing the same thing. But I rather to see them doing it when it's the love of God. When it's a revelation, when it's something real to them, that's where God wants us to come to the place where it becomes real to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Love of God real to us. If we are not there yet, it's still the law. And the law does not bring perfection. What brings perfection is the love of God inside of our heart. God, give me more of your love, Lord, that I'll do things. I'LL STILL BE OBEDIENT, BUT THE obedience through the love of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That the relationship God wanted as Israel same earlier, but that the relationship God had with Abraham, grace was there before the law. God loved Abraham. God loved David under grace. Amen. David made a mistake. Yes. But grace was still upon him. &gt;&gt; Election was still upon him. &gt;&gt; Love of God was still upon him. David, my beloved, love of God was still upon him. This age, we want the love of God to remain upon us. &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus Christ did not rebuke I'm moving on a little bit. The Lord Jesus Christ did not rebuke the Ephesian age for the lack of faith in Ephesus. He rebuked them because they rejected the first love. I'll read some of the quotes here. Prophet says Ephesus means the very name Ephesus means let go, relax, backsliden, called by God, the backsliden church. God God acknowledged first their works, their labor and their patience. God rebuked their living leaving living the first love for backslading for no longer bearing light. Ephesus was not a deceived church. It was not a deceived church. It failed itself by not continuing in perfect love. &gt;&gt; Says summary of fruits without love led to apostasy. The pro the promises paradise promised to the overcomer of the saints of Ephes in the church age given to the tree of life. Excuse me. Again brother I heard him saying that one time. says, "If they had continued in that perfect love, the rapture would have happened." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If the Ephesus church had continued in that perfect love, the rapture would have happened because they had the perfect faith. They had they had the word of God. They had Paul had the word of God. The messenger of that age, Paul went into the third heaven. The second Corinthians 12:24 says he went to the third he was caught up in the third heaven. Brother Bam went to the first heaven. Can you imagine Paul went to the third heaven and he went there says I knew such a man whether the body out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth but he's talking about himself. says how he was caught up in that paradise and heard unspeakable words probably heard this is me now probably heard the thunders over there but he can't speak it got the revelation but he can't speak it says I heard unspeakable words which is not lawful for a man to utter it was not the time yet as John saw that revelation he heard the thunders he heard the seals but he could not he he could not he was no you cannot Don't do it now. There will come a time where you have to manifest it. Amen. &gt;&gt; So they were there. They were in that perfect love but they went away from that perfect love. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now God is bringing us back to that perfect love. Says now this church has to come back to the perfect love of God. Amen. They say rejecting king. Rejecting king. Listen what the prophet says. The prophets had also the same experience as Paul. No, first let me read Abraham. Yeah, but I say it was a little translation. I went to the first heaven. If they it's that way in the first heaven, what did Paul see when he went to the third to the third? My no wonder he said I have not seen and ear have not heard. If that's that glorious in this in this heaven here, when you go into the third heaven, what must that brother have seen? The prophet say what they must have seen when he went to the third heaven. When he went to the third heaven and he came down he recommended perfect love. &gt;&gt; He did not recommend all we've so many other things. First Corinthians all good things all great good things. I can if I speak with tongues of men of angels and if if if I if I have the gift of prophecy if the if I know the mysteries if I know all the knowledge all the he once he went there and he calmed down said no there is something different all the mysteries that we have all the word of God that we have it has to be summarized into one thing when brother went to heaven and came down he did not say you have to understand and explain Then why everything mathematically everything I NO, HE JUST FOCUSED ON ONE THING. ZERO IN ON ONE THING. &gt;&gt; You must have perfect love. &gt;&gt; YOU MUST HAVE PERFECT LOVE. I'm more than convinced. And himself he say he says this is what you preach was the Holy Ghost. IT IS PERFECT LOVE. Nothing can enter here without that perfect love. I am more determined than ever in my life that it takes perfect love to enter there. &gt;&gt; SO WHY AM I COMING TO CHURCH LORD FOR PERFECT LOVE? &gt;&gt; WHY AM I LISTENING TO THE TAPES GOD FOR PERFECT LOVE? &gt;&gt; WHY WHY AM I PRAYING FOR FOR PERFECT LOVE? &gt;&gt; ALL OUR FOCUS IS UPON PERFECT LOVE. &gt;&gt; LORD GIVE ME THAT PERFECT LOVE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Have I exalted the perfect love for more a little bit this morning to the point gives you ask the desire Lord give me that perfect love not a theory only &gt;&gt; not only something that is a myth not something no god I WANT THE REALITY OF THE PERFECT LOVE IN MY HEART BECAUSE IF PERFECT LOVE IS IN MY HEART NOTHING CAN hurt me and I can't hurt anybody &gt;&gt; IF PERFECT LOVE IS HERE IN MY HEART IF THAT OPPOSOME BECAUSE OF THE LOVE THAT OPPOSOME HAD THERE WAS HEALING for the children. LET ME TELL YOU IF YOU HAVE THAT LOVE IN YOUR HEART, IT WILL BRING HEALING FOR YOUR FAMILY. IT WILL BRING HEALING IN YOUR BODY. IT WILL BE HEALING IN A CHURCH. IT WILL BRING it will GIVE THE SOLUTION TO YOUR PROBLEM. IMPERFECT LOVE IS INCLUDED EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE NEED OF. WHY? BECAUSE PERFECT LOVE IS GOD HIMSELF. I WOULD RATHER HAVE A CHURCH THAT IS FILLED WITH PERFECT LOVE THAN ANY OTHER GIFT BECAUSE PERFECT LOVE IS THE GIVER. IF YOU HAVE PERFECT LOVE, REAL GIFT WILL COME IN THE RIGHT WAY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WITHOUT WITHOUT WITHOUT COMPARISON, WITHOUT ANYTHING, WITHOUT PROVING THAT YOU ARE MORE THAN ANYTHING. NO, JUST THE LOVE OF GOD. LET'S GIVE A HAND TO THE LORD. &gt;&gt; Let me just read a little bit what is doing. I looked around and I thought, what is this? I looked really good. I can't understand it. But hope seemed to be like a guest of honor. She was no different but just like a guest of honor. And I heard a voice that that spoke to me that was in the room and said, "This is what you preached was the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; This is perfect love." &gt;&gt; In the age we are living, the Holy Ghost is perfect love. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost doesn't stop Although although I just put clarity brother preached the statue of perfect man before the seals were revealed. So if you read in this you don't be confused. Sometimes he's putting says uh uh uh before faith there says the new birth as you are growing and it says the holy ghost comes and it looks like he's differentiating it might look like it's differentiating the new birth and the holy ghost but the same thing. So your new birth is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; But as you are growing, you are growing, you are growing, you are growing. Now the capstone comes, you know the capstone is a pyramid by itself. &gt;&gt; So it has all the virtue in that capstone already. &gt;&gt; Brother said that that capstone is actually the one that gives strength to all the other virtues. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is the the super virtue. &gt;&gt; THANK GOD IN THE BRIGHT AGE we have the super virtue. It's God himself. It himself coming down coming to cup the church. AMEN. WITH THE WORD OF GOD, IT COMES TO COME. HE SAYS IS THE Holy Spirit. But what is that Holy Spirit is the love of God. It means the same new birth as you are growing. You come to the level where he comes himself and caps you with the adoption of the perfect love upon you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They all work together. But how is it possible? Only in this age. &gt;&gt; Let me read it again. And not nothing can enter here without it. I am more determined than ever in my life. It takes perfect love to enter there. God is not the God of just hazard and everything. The first vision that he had of the translation, he related it in the rejecting king which is in the same series of adoption. But brother Bam, you're talking about adoption. Why are you talking about love? Yes. Because adoption is love. God can't adopt someone who doesn't have perfect love &gt;&gt; because you do things by by yourself. You just it just go wrong. I explained it earlier. You just go wrong because you do things but but when you do things because you just love God, then God adopts you. So I say it takes perfect love in adoption. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm just reading it again. Says there was no jealousy. There was no tiredness. There was no death. Sickness could never never in there. Mortality could never make you old. They could not cry. It was just one joy. Oh my precious brother. They took they took me up and set me up on a big high place and I thought I'm not dreaming. I'm looking back and my body lay down on there in the bed. So heaven is not too far. It's just few meters. It's just another dimensions in denomination. You think heaven you have to go and you know the astronaut went to the other side said we didn't see God. Oh you went too far. He's right here. He's even here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Heaven is now in the heart of the believer &gt;&gt; now because the capstone has come down. God himself has come down. &gt;&gt; That's the time you are living in. Praise be to God. I like that one of my favorite quote. What was the Holy Ghost given for? What is the Holy Ghost God in you? What is it for? to continue his work among his people, to bring his church together, to bring the church to a place in this day. Now listen, to bring the the same Holy Spirit, but in this day, it goes far beyond the Lutarian. &gt;&gt; Amen. The justification we believe is way beyond the justification of Luther. Actually, brother Bam is giving better explanation than Luther because the capstone is one that gives strength to the other virtues. He come and shows of what the justification is not only you are forgiven. It's more than that as if you have never done it to begin with. &gt;&gt; So the Holy Ghost goes FAR BEYOND THE LUTHERAN, FAR BEYOND the Methodist. Far beyond the Methodist sanctification you can try on your own. And we thank God you need to try. You need to do. You need to separate. But there is a time where it comes from the inside. It's cleaning YOU. IT WASHING YOU. THE BLEEDING WORD IS WASHING YOU. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S THE SANCTIFICATION I WANT. LORD JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; WHAT CAN DO THAT? THE CAPSTONE AGAIN. THE LOVE OF GOD. IT WILL WASH YOU. IT WILL CLEANSE YOU. I'M ENCOURAGING YOU BRIDE OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. Stay in the channel. &gt;&gt; STAY WITH THE WORD OF GOD. STAY WITH THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. YOU MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND BUT PERFECT LOVE WILL CLEANSE YOU WILL WASH YOU WILL SEPARATE YOU FROM THE THINGS OF THE WORLD WILL GIVING YOU A LIFE OF PRAYER WILL GIVE YOU THE LOVE FOR GOD AMEN YOU CAN'T CREATE THAT LOVE YOURSELF BUT THE MORE YOU STAY IN THE CHANNEL GOD WILL POUR THAT LOVE amen &gt;&gt; because you already started here he will walk with you along the way &gt;&gt; and this is the age where is pouring it the fullness of himself &gt;&gt; far beyond the Lorian, the Methodist, the Pentecostal. The Pentecostal are the real gift of the Holy Ghost. They speak in tong. But thank God for the capstone. He put things in order. You do this at this time, not when the preacher is preaching. BUT THAT COME DIRECTLY FROM GOD. He can speak anytime. So no, no, no, no, no, no. The Holy Spirit is on the pulpit there. Is not the altar of disorder. &gt;&gt; Who can say that? Only the capstone comes to put things in order. It gives strength to every oh every of them because with in this age &gt;&gt; the good things they don't have any value anymore if you don't have the capstone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pentecostals we're far beyond the Pentecost into a place to adoption and rapturing grace. The Holy Spirit comes to prepare us for the rapture. &gt;&gt; This is the bride for the rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are the church that God fordained for the rapture. &gt;&gt; Can I just a little bit? Give me a few minutes here more to say about. So the first age they had perfect faith which is sister to perfect love. The perfect love. Perfect faith. Bam says they work together. So God rebuked them in Revelation 2:45 said, "Nevertheless, I have some heart against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. Remember therefore from whence the heart fallen and repent and do the first works, else I will come unto thee quickly, and remove the candlestick of this place, except I repent." Prophet says the first love, the fervent desire to please God, the passion to know his word, the cry for reaching out in the spirit all begins to fade and instead of that church being on fire if the fire of God has cooled off and become a bit formal. I don't want that &gt;&gt; and I know you don't want that. This is what was happening back there in the E in the Ephesians. Like I said, they were not deceived. They just cooled off. They're still Christians that still but they just cooled off. Just be a little bit lukewarm a little bit. You know what? You know, God understands a little bit. Just a little bit. God, I don't want to be there, &gt;&gt; but let me boil with love. like gosh now is in love. &gt;&gt; Everything is blue. Everything is is rose roses. Lord, help me to become that place. I'm just so in love with you. Don't let me become lukewarm. Become like I'm just a Christian. I just, you know what? No. Lord, help me to be in love. Help me to be in love with you. to to love you with all my heart, Lord. &gt;&gt; Stir my love a little bit, Lord. That's my prayer. Stir my love a little bit. When when I've become cold, stir me a little bit, Lord, to love you more. &gt;&gt; To love you more, Father. So, they became a bit former. That is what was happening back there in Ephes. They became they they were getting a bit formal. The abandonment to God was dying out. And the people weren't too careful about what God thought of them as they began to be careful about what the world thought of them. The second generation coming on was just like Israel. They demand the king as it goes on says um it isn't long until you see them stop doing things they used to do and start doing things they couldn't they wouldn't do initially. They change their manner of dress, their attitude and their behavior. They get laxed. This is what Ephesus means. relaxed drifting that's the danger they had everything everything like in our age but they start become former they start they start looking at the world not deceive but looking at the world a few moments ago I mentioned that John understood what it was to love God that great apostle of love will certainly see it when the church began to lose that first love of God in 1 John 5:3 said for this is the love of God that we keep his commandment, his word. One little deviation from that word was a step away from God. People say they love God. They go to church. They even shout and rejoice and sing and have a great emotional time. When when it's all over, watch and see if they are in the in that word, walking in that word or living in that word. If they go through all the others and and then don't walk in that word, they can say they love God, but their lives will tell story. &gt;&gt; I wonder if John didn't see a lot of that before he died. People saying they loved God, but not obeying his word. &gt;&gt; But thank God for the bride of the air. &gt;&gt; When sometimes you become lukewarm, thank God he sent someone behind the purpose says, "Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. You are the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ. Don't be distracted. AMEN. YOU ARE THE BELOVED ONE. WAKE UP. LOVE HIM MORE. EXPRESS YOUR LOVELY. &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES HE COMES AND he preaches it. Sometimes if there's a song or there atmosphere, it just makes you a LITTLE BIT. OH, THANK GOD FOR THAT. THANK YOU FOR REVIVING THAT LOVE A LITTLE BIT, LORD. &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD. LIKE IN THE NATURAL, you know, sometimes it's good to revive a little bit the married couple. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. a little bit surprises and oh hey sweet don't make it monotones and formal and traditional sisters also sometimes little bit the brother comes from work you sharp very well clean don't just be like is it better again make the same thing spiritually as well. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank God. One day, look, thank God for and he does that very often. Sometimes he send the visitors here and the visitor preaches so well WITH HIS SO THANK GOD. THANK GOD OR HE GIVES A FRESH REVELATION to to my to to my brother or to me or to whoever will and oh thank God &gt;&gt; because he doesn't want us to stay lukewarm. Thank God for his grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now I will finish with this. the church choosing law for grace. And if if you can do one thing to save yourself, then there is no one spec of it. Grace, law is what you do in regard to the grace that God has shown you by by saving you. As I've often said, I don't run around with other women because I'm afraid my wife will divorce me. I don't run around with the other women because I don't run around with with the other women because I love my wife. That's it. I don't believe that you should run around, but a law isn't what keeps it my marriage vow. It's my love. It's the reason I love God. Not because I'm afraid he send me to hell. I don't believe he'll do that. But because I love him so much, I don't want to do it. There's nothing in me to make me do it. I love him so much. I love him too much. And I want that expression we have to be my expression to be your expression. I love God too much. You want me to do this? No, I can't do I I just love him so much. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Love him. That that's why he put the first commandment. Love the God I the Lord thy God. Because he knew that if you love him, all the other commandments are not even commandments anymore. THEY'RE JUST PART THEY'RE SWALLOWED UP INTO THAT first commandment BECAUSE YOU LOVE GOD. YOU CAN'T HURT YOUR BROTHER. YOU CAN'T HURT YOUR SISTER. EVERYTHING IS INCLUDED IN THAT LOVE OF GOD. AMEN. GOD, I love you. Anybody saying I love my brother and MY SISTER WITH AGAPA LOVE unconditional what you do to me I still whatever you do to me you know today is that you invite me at your house then I will invite you. No. Whether you invite me, you don't invite me, I still love you. &gt;&gt; I'll still invite you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the level of unconditional. &gt;&gt; I just do things because I love God. Not because of this, not because I'm waiting for this. Not Lord, remove that from me. &gt;&gt; Let me just read the whole quot the whole I wouldn't hurt him for nothing. Certainly, I love him. When men and women get to a place, well, I really ought to to stay at home and see this good play tonight, but I tell you, they'll think I'm back. If I don't go on down at church, says you sat there and sleep anyhow. You might as well have stayed home and looked at something you would enjoy more. I didn't know that it was there, but it's good. When your joy becomes the Lord and the Lord is your joy, &gt;&gt; you can't stay away from church, &gt;&gt; then you are getting somewhere. &gt;&gt; The church was in a better shape 40 years ago for the coming of the Lord than it is tonight. Way better. They were closer to God. They were more they were they had more God among them. They more they had more spirit among them than they got tonight. I say, "Oh, what a rebuke." I'll say, "That's a rebuke." But we don't want to be there. We want we want to be more in love with God because he has given us a a promise. Amen. That the promise of per of perfection. He said Jeremiah 31:33 said, "Behold, the days come, say the Lord, that I will put my new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, which my covenant they break, although I was an husband unto them, say the Lord, husband unto Israel." He loved them, but they didn't love him back. But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel, spiritual Israel. After those days, means in our days, &gt;&gt; say the Lord. I will put my law in the inward part &gt;&gt; and I will write it in their heart &gt;&gt; and I will be their God and they shall be MY PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR PUTTING THE WORD OF GOD IN OUR HEART. THANK GOD FOR MALACHI 4 CHANGING OUR HEART TO BE able to RECEIVE THE WORD OF GOD. NOW IT'S NOT SOMEONE PUSHING YOU. SOMEONE SAY YOU HAVE to do this, YOU HAVE TO. PAUL WILL TAKE THAT ANOTHER PLACE SAYS that scripture said no one can teach another person. It's not SOMEONE TO COME YOU HAVE TO DO THIS. YOU YOU HAVE TO DO THIS. NO. NO. IT IS NOT it's me to DO IT. THANK GOD FOR THIS. YOU you teach me and I'll do it. That actually the message what it is. &gt;&gt; You teach me, I do it. &gt;&gt; If I don't do it, it's because I don't know it. But once I know it, I DO IT BECAUSE I LOVE HIM SO MUCH. You put that into my heart. You wrote your word of God into my heart. I want it to leave the tapes. I want it to leave the Bible. The letter killers, BUT THE SPIRIT GIVES LIFE. I WANT YOU TO COME FROM those place to come now into my heart. Lord Lord give me your your love. That's my desire. Is that your desire? &gt;&gt; Amen. Church of God, is that your desire? &gt;&gt; Is we are more than determined that it requires perfect love to get anything. And this church has and will have perfect love. &gt;&gt; Let's give the hand to the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you Lord. We thank you, Father. Musicians can come. In a moment like this, like I sing out a song. &gt;&gt; I sing out a love song love song to Jesus. In moments like these, &gt;&gt; I lift up my hands. &gt;&gt; I lift up my hands to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Sing. &gt;&gt; Let's stand together and tell him that we love you. Singing I love you, Lord. Singing I love you, Lord. I love you. One more time. In a moment like this. &gt;&gt; In moment like this, &gt;&gt; I sing out a song. &gt;&gt; I sing out a love song to Jesus. In moments like these, &gt;&gt; I lift up my hands. &gt;&gt; I lift up my hands to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's sing it together. Singing. &gt;&gt; Sing I love you, Lord. Singing I love you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Singing I love you, &gt;&gt; Lord. I love you. &gt;&gt; Let's just pray together. Just speak to him. Father, Lord, we thank you for your grace. We love you, Father. Lord, we glorify your name. We praise you, Lord Jesus Christ. We thank you for projecting your love one more time, Father, on that this morning, God. And our desire, God, is just to express our love towards you, Father, to love you more. That's why we pray, Lord, give us that divine love inside of our heart. that the Holy Spirit that comes to the full maturity of Christ. Father, Lord, help me to love you more, more than ever before, Father, that I can express that the prophet like the prophet said, "I love you so much, too much that Father, I can't do anything to hurt you, to displease you. That's my desire, Father. Lord, make it a reality for every believer that Father, you just unveil your love one more time. Don't let us father get away from the first love.
