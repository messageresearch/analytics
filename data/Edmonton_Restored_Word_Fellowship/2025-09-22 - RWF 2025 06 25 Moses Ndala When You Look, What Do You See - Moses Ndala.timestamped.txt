[38:19] thank God for that. God bless you.
[38:24] Brother Zeke's traveling as has been
[38:26] mentioned. Sister Anita, we'll miss you.
[38:31] I miss I will miss my I'm glad I'm not
[38:34] the one preaching on Mon on on Sunday.
[38:38] I will miss my left Amen corner here.
[38:42] That's I enjoy. like
[38:46] um so 2 Kings chapter 6
[39:21] 2 Kings chapter 6 from 15 to 17
[39:26] mentioned that many times but
[39:30] the scripture I also like
[39:33] Elisha at Dortan
[39:37] for 15 And
[39:40] and when the servant of the man of God
[39:42] was risen early, and gone forth, behold,
[39:45] and host compassed the city, both with
[39:48] horses and chariots. And his servant
[39:51] said unto him, Alas, my master, how
[39:55] shall we do? And he answered, Fear not.
[40:01] For they that be with us are more than
[40:04] they that be with them. Amen. And Elisha
[40:07] prayed and said, "Lord, I prayed you
[40:09] open his eyes that he may see." Amen.
[40:12] And the Lord opened the eyes of the
[40:14] young man, and he saw, and behold, the
[40:17] mountain was full of horses and chariots
[40:20] of fire round about Elisha. Amen. May
[40:23] God bless his word. Can have a seat.
[40:25] Amen.
[40:38] I invite you again to go to the Exodus
[40:41] 14. similar scripture, similar context
[40:46] and
[41:00] Exodus 14, 13,6
[41:07] Bible says,
[41:10] "And Moses said unto the people, people
[41:12] fear not.
[41:16] If you start even from 12,
[41:19] is not this the word that we did tell
[41:22] thee in Egypt, saying, "Let us alone
[41:25] that we may serve the Egyptians, for it
[41:28] had been better for us to serve the
[41:30] Egyptians
[41:31] than that we should die in the
[41:33] wilderness."
[41:35] And Moses said unto the people, "Fear ye
[41:37] not. Stand still and see the salvation
[41:41] of the Lord, which he will show to you
[41:44] today. For the Egyptian whom you have
[41:47] seen today, you shall see them again no
[41:51] more forever.
[41:53] And the Lord shall fight for you, and he
[41:55] shall hold, and he shall hold your
[41:57] peace. And the Lord said unto Moses,
[42:00] Wherefore Christ thou unto me? Speak
[42:03] unto the children of Israel that they go
[42:06] forward, but lift thou up thy rod, and
[42:10] stretch out thine hand over the sea, and
[42:12] divide it, and the children of Israel
[42:15] shall go on dry ground through the midst
[42:19] of the sea. May God bless his word.
[42:21] Amen.
[42:27] like to
[42:29] just to use those two examples a little
[42:31] bit to stress on the importance of faith
[42:34] once again as we are on this subject of
[42:36] faith. I think faith is a very important
[42:39] thing. Amen. I think once we once you
[42:42] really have faith and the real real
[42:45] revelation of faith Christian life will
[42:48] become much simpler much simpler if you
[42:51] have faith. Amen. And that's what I just
[42:54] want to emphasize here. For me, these
[42:56] two situations are very similar and it
[43:00] show how God expects us, what God
[43:02] expects from us because they're very
[43:04] similar. It looks like like an
[43:07] experience of Moses. It showed that
[43:09] sometimes he go through situations.
[43:12] Moses was called. He had a commission.
[43:15] Prophet will use that in why cry and
[43:17] speak. He had a commission. He has been
[43:19] called. It says Moses had that saved the
[43:22] Lord. He had comes and everything was
[43:24] thus saved the Lord. Thou save the Lord.
[43:26] Thou save the Lord. But Moses was a
[43:29] confirmed prophet. He was vindicated
[43:31] prophet. He knew his place. He knew that
[43:33] God called him when he went on his own.
[43:36] He failed. He killed only one Egyptians.
[43:39] Only one Egyptian. And he had to run
[43:41] away from from that from that from that.
[43:43] And he knew that he was called for that.
[43:45] Knew that was something special about
[43:47] him. He knew his mothers told him. But
[43:49] he did not have a personal experience
[43:51] with God. But this time he went back one
[43:54] man in invasion the prophet will call
[43:56] it. He knew he knew that God was
[43:59] standing with him. He knew that God will
[44:01] fight for him. He knew that God will
[44:02] vindicate his word. The same thing for
[44:05] us, the same thing for you, the same
[44:06] thing for me. We know that when you have
[44:09] an experience with God, it's not your
[44:12] battle anymore. Is the Lord's battle.
[44:14] Amen. So we should not fear anything.
[44:16] Amen. We should not fear anything. We
[44:18] should not be we should not be tossed
[44:20] about. We should not be in turmoil. We
[44:23] should not be worrying, you know. We
[44:24] should just be moving forward checking
[44:26] if the word of God is the will of God
[44:29] and keep moving forward. Moses knew that
[44:32] he was in God's will. You know that
[44:34] God's God's perfect will because it was
[44:37] not the way Moses himself thought to go.
[44:40] There was many shortcuts but God told
[44:43] him to go that way over the sea. God put
[44:45] him in that way. He knew what will
[44:47] happen and God was in control of every
[44:50] situation. For your life, for my life,
[44:52] God is in control of every situation.
[44:55] You might not know why am I going this,
[44:57] why is this? Why there is an easier way?
[44:59] Why it happened this? But God is in
[45:01] control of every situation. But when he
[45:04] came here, he realized, oh, but but but
[45:07] there is no way. There's no way. Look to
[45:09] the left. Look to the right. Look behind
[45:12] the the left to right mountains behind
[45:15] the Egyptians forward there is the sea
[45:17] where the only way is looking into God.
[45:20] Amen. We come to those kind of
[45:22] situations we have to come to we go
[45:25] through all those kind of situation and
[45:27] thank God we go through those kind of
[45:29] situations because we can to look up to
[45:32] God. Amen. He knows it. Amen. And Moses
[45:35] came to that situation. Moses prophet
[45:37] say Moses started being worried and I
[45:40] like the way because it comes to I
[45:42] always like that because it comes to my
[45:44] I'm struggling with that if it's not
[45:46] your battle sometimes I struggle with
[45:48] that everything is fine but when
[45:50] something is out of order
[45:56] amen then this comes to my mind why are
[46:00] you worried why do you worry so much I
[46:04] have everything under control. Amen.
[46:09] Amen. Now Moses get in trouble and God
[46:11] say now I have got them started on their
[46:13] journey. They have all done called out
[46:15] the church is together. So have them
[46:18] I've got them all on their journey. Why?
[46:20] Cry speak. Moses take them over. I've
[46:24] told you to do. I'm going to sit down
[46:26] and rest a while. Let God speaking.
[46:28] Moses said oh Lord look coming here
[46:30] comes Pharaoh. The people are all what
[46:32] must I do? What must I do? See there
[46:35] isn't that the prophet isn't that just
[46:38] human beings we are all human beings
[46:41] isn't that just human beings yes sir
[46:43] begin to cry what must I do here we see
[46:47] Moses expressingly fully human nature
[46:50] always wants God to get behind always
[46:53] want God to get behind you and push you
[46:55] into something that's today you want God
[46:59] after we have seen all we have seen yet
[47:02] you want God to push you to do
[47:04] something. See, Moses had just laxed
[47:07] around and said, "God, I'll go ask you
[47:10] and see what you say." Yeah. Yeah, you
[47:12] say it. Well, all right. I'll say it.
[47:15] I'll say it too.
[47:18] But here, God had ordained him for the
[47:20] job. Prove that he was with him. Here he
[47:23] is. The circumstances come up. Difficult
[47:27] circumstances, different circumstance
[47:29] than what he thought. He thought that
[47:31] when Pharaoh had said, you know, you go
[47:33] and make sure you don't come back
[47:35] anymore and he put them away. Moses
[47:38] probably thought that no, that's it with
[47:40] Pharaoh. I'm have nothing to do with
[47:41] Pharaoh anymore.
[47:43] But here the circumstances has changed.
[47:46] Then he begins to cry, what can I do,
[47:48] Lord? What can I do? Now you remember he
[47:51] had already prophesied here. For he
[47:53] said, these Egyptians that you see
[47:55] today, you'll see them no more. Then
[47:58] immediately begin to cry God what can I
[48:00] we do and and he had done a pretty good
[48:03] job in prophesying that the prophet says
[48:05] but he told them what happened if the
[48:06] word of God was with him I was in him it
[48:09] was in him but when I was telling that
[48:11] it actually come to pass what know then
[48:14] the prophet goes on and says he had
[48:15] already proved what what you say will
[48:18] happen I am with you and here a
[48:21] circumstance rose in a moment what must
[48:25] I do Oh, what must I do, Lord? Yeah,
[48:29] Lord. Here. Where are you at? Yeah. Do
[48:33] Do you hear me, Lord?
[48:36] Do you hear me? Sometimes you pray feel
[48:38] like your prayers don't go in. Do you
[48:40] hear me? What must I do? He had already
[48:44] ordained him and vindicated him, proved
[48:47] and worked everything through him. And
[48:49] here God, oh my, fully expressing man
[48:53] wants to rest and let God do the
[48:55] pushing.
[48:57] So no, here you have to do this, here
[48:59] you have to do this, here you have to do
[49:00] this and everything. God gives you a
[49:02] commission and God stands behind you and
[49:06] you go with that commission. The prophet
[49:08] will take and put a balance about this
[49:10] message and he will say you know when
[49:12] he's talking about Paul prisoner of
[49:14] Christ and he preach one Sunday and
[49:17] another Sunday he preach another message
[49:18] and I forgot which one goes first I
[49:21] think the one goes first and say no
[49:23] remember my message I preach about it
[49:25] and he says and put a balance you know
[49:29] sometimes we go without having any
[49:31] commission we go and we do our own say
[49:33] no you need to be a prisoner of Christ
[49:36] you need to know what the Word of God
[49:38] say you are prisoner to what the word of
[49:40] God says. So you wait until you see what
[49:43] the word of God says before you do
[49:45] anything. But once you see what the word
[49:47] of God says, don't back off. Don't back.
[49:50] Keep continuing with the word of God
[49:53] because it is the word of God. I trust
[49:55] the word of God. I have faith in the
[49:57] word of God. I cannot deny the word of
[49:59] God. Paul had God told Paul and said,
[50:02] "Paul, go to Rome. I will be with you.
[50:04] You will stand there. I will be with
[50:06] you." But you know that from the point
[50:08] where God sent him to the point where he
[50:10] went wrong, he went through many trials.
[50:13] He went through many ups and downs,
[50:15] there was a a point where he had to
[50:17] stand be before I grippy, you know. He
[50:20] had to stand before before what the the
[50:23] Jews wanted to kill him all the trials.
[50:25] But he knew that God told me that I will
[50:27] be there. God will stand with me. Amen.
[50:30] Do you know that he went through a
[50:32] storm? Do you know that he want a
[50:33] shipwreck? Amen. But he didn't he didn't
[50:36] lose faith in the word of God. God told
[50:38] me that I will be there no matter what.
[50:41] I will be there. Do you know that there
[50:43] was a snake on the way that beat him?
[50:45] But he didn't didn't change his faith in
[50:48] the word of God. God told me I'll be
[50:50] there. I will be there. Amen. Did you
[50:52] know that the Roman soldier wanted to
[50:54] kill him? But that didn't change
[50:55] anything. The angel of the Lord told me
[50:57] that I will be there. I will be there.
[51:00] God told you. God told me that he will
[51:03] never leave you. He will never forsake
[51:05] you. We should just rest in God's
[51:07] promises. God, you are with me. You are
[51:09] walking with me. You are answering my
[51:11] prayers. Praise be to your name. It's
[51:14] not my battle. It is your battle, Lord.
[51:17] I will trust in you no matter what. I
[51:20] don't understand. I don't see it. But
[51:21] you are with me. Amen. Hallelujah. Thank
[51:24] you. Oh my. Amen. It's the same God. God
[51:28] is with you. That's what Elisha was.
[51:31] Elisha was the same circumstances as
[51:33] Moses. The same circumstances,
[51:36] but he didn't have to doubt. He didn't
[51:39] have to be worried. Did not have to
[51:41] tremble. I like that quote of the
[51:42] prophet. I tried to look for it, but
[51:44] didn't find it. He didn't even have
[51:46] Prophet. No, he he I don't think he had
[51:49] he saw them, but he he knew that they
[51:51] were there. You don't have to see the
[51:53] angels that are there, but you know that
[51:55] they are there. Amen. Praise be to God.
[51:57] Whether you see it, you don't see, they
[51:59] are there. Amen.
[52:02] Because God is telling the angel of the
[52:04] Lord shall camp around those who fear
[52:06] the Lord. Amen. I will never leave you.
[52:08] I will never forsake you. The world
[52:10] might not see me, but you will see me.
[52:13] What kind of eyes do you have to see
[52:15] God? Amen. Amen. That's my title today.
[52:19] When you look, what do you see? When you
[52:22] look, what do you see? Circumstances.
[52:25] Same circumstances, same problems. But
[52:28] when you look at those problems, what do
[52:30] you see? Do you focus on the problems?
[52:32] You focus on the difficulty? Do you
[52:34] focus on the challenges? Or do you see
[52:37] God inside that trial? Amen.
[52:40] Elisha looked at the same situation, the
[52:43] same Syrians, the same army. They're
[52:45] coming. They're coming to look for
[52:47] Elisha. They're not even coming to look
[52:49] for Gazi. But the Gazi is trembling. Is
[52:52] is is Oh, what am I going to do? What am
[52:54] I Look at the soldier. Look at the
[52:56] Syrians. He lashes. Oh, don't worry.
[52:59] Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry.
[53:02] The one who is with us, those who are
[53:04] with us are greater than those that you
[53:07] see. The invisible army around us. Amen.
[53:12] Oh, I like that.
[53:15] Oh, praise be to God.
[53:18] The prophet says, "Resting in Christ
[53:21] perfectly. No matter what comes or goes,
[53:23] nothing can touch us without it comes
[53:26] over the shepherd first. He has to
[53:28] permit it. The Bible says all things
[53:30] work together for good to them that love
[53:33] the Lord has to come over shepherd
[53:36] first. Said I am the door. No man can
[53:38] come in without me accepting it. If he
[53:41] is the shepherd, if there of the
[53:44] sheepfold is standing there, no danger,
[53:47] no problem can go to us before it goes
[53:50] through him first. So he has to agree.
[53:52] He has to allow knowing that you can
[53:54] stand a trial knowing that you can stand
[53:56] a difficult time knowing that you he can
[53:59] he cannot give you anything that is
[54:01] beyond what you can stand. So just trust
[54:04] in him trust in his word. Amen. Amen.
[54:07] Amen.
[54:10] Prophet says in faith he says as you see
[54:11] the great army looking for Elijah said
[54:13] oh my father the whole armies they have
[54:15] gathered and surrounded here. They're
[54:17] looking for you. He didn't shake that
[54:19] old prophet one bit. It might have been
[54:23] cancer. It might have been tuberculosis.
[54:25] It might have been a stroke, but he
[54:28] didn't shake that prophet. He looked at
[54:30] him and said, "Son, there is more with
[54:32] us than there is with them." No matter
[54:35] what, the enemy can try to be there
[54:37] looking for you, but he cannot find you.
[54:40] Do you know that when they arrive to the
[54:41] prophet,
[54:44] we are looking for Elisha the prophet?
[54:46] Oh, you're looking for Elisha the
[54:48] prophet. Oh, come come come. I will lead
[54:51] you to Elisha the prophet.
[54:54] He will lead him. But he's there with
[54:56] them. Completely blinded. They can't see
[54:59] what happening. They are bl they are
[55:01] looking but they can't see. What do you
[55:03] see? You they don't see the prophet.
[55:05] Why? Because they were completely
[55:07] blinded.
[55:13] Amen.
[55:15] the situation
[55:17] sometimes we go through
[55:21] it's not us we should try to try to
[55:24] solve everything on our own mind let God
[55:27] take into control over that situation
[55:31] one person said one time says I was
[55:34] talking to two people
[55:36] one was blind and the other one was was
[55:40] normal person and he was talking to them
[55:43] and he's explaining something in a
[55:44] situation and the blind person says,
[55:47] "Oh, I see it. I see it." And the normal
[55:51] person says, "I don't see it."
[55:54] Now you ask, "Who is blind?"
[55:57] I thought that you will see it when the
[55:59] blind won't want it. But the blind
[56:01] caught it right before the other one. So
[56:03] seeing is not always with our eyes.
[56:05] There is another seeing that we have to
[56:07] see with and that's what God want us to
[56:10] see with. Faith is a super sense. Faith
[56:14] is a sense that goes beyond the natural
[56:17] sense. Faith is something that you
[56:19] cannot always understand with our
[56:21] natural senses. We get to that.
[56:23] Hopefully I have a little bit of time. I
[56:24] don't want to stay too long. Give time
[56:26] for prayer. But I just want to put that
[56:28] in our faith. The prophet says our faith
[56:31] cannot rest upon nothing. A Christian
[56:34] has to have or his faith has to have a
[56:37] solid resting place. You know that the
[56:40] only resting place that a Christian, a
[56:43] true bornagain Christian can rest his
[56:45] faith or hers is upon the unmovable word
[56:49] of God. Amen. It isn't built upon the
[56:51] shifting sands of man's theology or
[56:54] doctrines or upon some church
[56:56] affiliation. But the true believer is
[56:58] faith its rest solidly on shifting as he
[57:02] approaches the word of God. Amen. Now he
[57:05] says, "I say the Christian faith is
[57:08] based solidly upon rest." That's right.
[57:11] A Christian is not tossed about. A
[57:14] Christian doesn't run from place to
[57:16] place. A Christian doesn't fast and fume
[57:19] and worry about things. A Christian
[57:21] rests. It's all over. It's all finished
[57:25] for the believer at Calvary. That's
[57:26] right. Or sickness may come and
[57:29] disappointment.
[57:31] Disappointment may come. How many
[57:33] believe that disappointment can come?
[57:35] What is a disappointing? It may seem you
[57:37] expecting it to be this way and then it
[57:39] turned out to be the other way and you
[57:40] get disappointed and no disappointment
[57:43] can come and they will come. Says but
[57:45] disappointment come but the Christian is
[57:47] at rest. Knowing this knowing that God
[57:51] is able to keep that which he has
[57:54] performed.
[57:55] Knowing that no matter what the things
[57:58] is or how it looks, there is neither
[58:00] sickness or sorrow or death. There is
[58:03] neither starvation or anything that can
[58:05] separate us from the love of God that is
[58:08] in Jesus Christ. We are at rest. So let
[58:13] the old sheep toss and toss any way she
[58:16] wants to. The anchor holds. Amen. A
[58:21] Christian is not you holding God. It's
[58:23] God holding you. Amen. So we should just
[58:26] rest knowing that God has everything
[58:28] under control. The anchor holds and the
[58:31] anchor master hold. And he tell about
[58:33] the story. I saw one time I was in a
[58:35] harbor. I saw a ship that was so tossed
[58:37] about one way or the other. He was
[58:39] wondering oh that ship is going to turn
[58:41] over. Oh wonder how can it stand? And
[58:43] the person was next to him. Oh don't
[58:45] worry. The anchor is holding. The anchor
[58:48] is so then as he saw that he realized
[58:51] himself. Oh, thank God. No matter what
[58:53] can happen one in the natural, in my
[58:56] senses, in my feelings, in the mind, by
[58:58] the anchor hold. Let the anchor hold.
[59:02] Let the faith hold. Let the super sense
[59:06] hold. Faith is the substance of things
[59:09] hoped for. Is the evidence of things
[59:12] that we don't see. How can you have an
[59:15] evidence if you can't if you can't
[59:17] demonstrate it? If you can't declare it,
[59:20] it means there must be a sense that has
[59:22] that evidence. Amen. So faith or the
[59:25] Holy Ghost is that is that sense that
[59:28] can have that evidence. Others cannot
[59:30] see but you by faith you see it. Amen.
[59:35] May God give us that that faith more and
[59:37] more.
[59:39] Prophet says my faith doesn't anchor in
[59:41] what the coming meetings will be. My
[59:43] faith doesn't rest in only in any
[59:46] ability that I would have or upon what
[59:48] church I will join or what people I
[59:51] should associate with. My faith anchors
[59:54] and rest entirely upon the finished work
[59:57] of the Lord Jesus Christ already been
[1:00:00] received. Every redemptive blessings,
[1:00:04] every redemptive blessings, healing,
[1:00:06] salvation, the Holy Ghost is is already
[1:00:09] being paid for at Calvary. Amen. What we
[1:00:12] need of is to have faith to hold to that
[1:00:15] promise of God and say it's mine. Amen.
[1:00:20] Amen.
[1:00:26] Super sense. The prophet says
[1:00:36] he said the super sense is the Holy
[1:00:38] Ghost.
[1:00:40] It says God gave those senses, the five
[1:00:42] senses. He says, but they are given to
[1:00:44] you as a gift. It depends on how you
[1:00:47] what you yield these senses to will be
[1:00:50] the way that your life is controlled.
[1:00:52] The way you yield those five senses. The
[1:00:55] way you let them control you, the way
[1:00:57] you let them lead you, the way you yield
[1:00:59] to one sense or the other, they control
[1:01:01] your life. They control our lives. Then
[1:01:04] he says, "But we are grateful to God
[1:01:05] that we have the five senses, but by no
[1:01:09] means was those was these five senses
[1:01:12] given to you to guide you. Our five
[1:01:15] senses of the flesh were not given to us
[1:01:17] to guide us." Amen. That's right. They
[1:01:20] were given to you for earthly contact
[1:01:23] but it was given to you but there was
[1:01:25] given to you the six sense and the sixth
[1:01:28] sense is belongs only to the Christians.
[1:01:32] You cannot have the six sense until you
[1:01:34] become a Christian. Amen. It is the only
[1:01:37] way that you can ever can ever have any
[1:01:40] more than the five natural senses for
[1:01:42] the natural person. The six sense is
[1:01:45] better known to the Christian as faith.
[1:01:48] It's the one that governs and guides you
[1:01:50] and is superior to all the other senses.
[1:01:54] It's superior to all of the senses, the
[1:01:57] other five senses. Now I would not say
[1:02:01] that because that you have the six sense
[1:02:03] that the five senses are no good no
[1:02:05] more. Yes they are. Those five senses
[1:02:08] were given to you by God and they are to
[1:02:11] be used. But when the five senses act
[1:02:14] contrary to the word of God then they
[1:02:17] are lying. Amen. Because there is one
[1:02:20] sense that is superior than the other
[1:02:21] one. We have the five senses and if you
[1:02:24] are touching let me mean then say you
[1:02:26] have the five senses. You're touching
[1:02:27] something and it looks like something
[1:02:29] different. You know, you don't look at
[1:02:31] it and it's oh sometimes you put your
[1:02:33] phone and you look like you touch. Oh,
[1:02:36] it's like the same shape as the but to
[1:02:39] determine that it oh no it's not this
[1:02:40] not this was not the phone it was the
[1:02:42] table you can look at it and the eye
[1:02:46] as predominance to what you are feeling.
[1:02:48] Amen. It was feeling something close to
[1:02:51] it but when you look through your eyes
[1:02:52] you say oh no that's it. Sometimes you
[1:02:54] can look at someone and you hear like
[1:02:56] okay it sounds like oh me and the boys
[1:02:59] in my family people say we sound the
[1:03:01] same so I can be talking there then oh
[1:03:03] brother Moses there oh it's brother
[1:03:05] Moses but one you see oh no that's not
[1:03:07] brother Moses I thought it was brother
[1:03:09] Moses my hear I thought it was brother
[1:03:10] Moses you are very close amen but one
[1:03:13] sense predomin the other one the same
[1:03:15] thing for the five senses oh I feel I
[1:03:17] feel like I'm still sick see like I see
[1:03:20] the symptoms the same way I see but one
[1:03:22] the other senses of faith takes over.
[1:03:25] What I see is doesn't have doesn't
[1:03:27] matter anymore. It's what the word of
[1:03:29] God says that has predominance to what I
[1:03:33] see to what I hear to what I feel. Amen.
[1:03:36] The super sense have to guide that's
[1:03:38] been given us to guide us to control us.
[1:03:41] Amen. Amen.
[1:03:43] Amen.
[1:03:46] They say the super sense is the Holy
[1:03:47] Spirit, the faith that of God that
[1:03:50] dwells in you. And if you let the five
[1:03:52] senses be healed to the six sense, it
[1:03:54] will guide you and bring all the other
[1:03:56] five senses under control of that super
[1:03:59] sense. It's so far above the natural
[1:04:02] senses as the spiritual man is above the
[1:04:06] natural man. It makes you believe things
[1:04:08] that you cannot see. It makes you act
[1:04:11] where you do not think the five senses
[1:04:13] will ever think about it. The devil can
[1:04:16] get into these five senses and lie to
[1:04:19] you. But he cannot touch the super
[1:04:22] sense. The other five senses can be
[1:04:25] deceived. But the super sense cannot be
[1:04:28] deceived. The devil cannot touch the
[1:04:30] super sense. Oh God, let the super sense
[1:04:33] have control over our lives.
[1:04:37] Even in our church, hallelujah. When you
[1:04:40] look at your brother, don't look at the
[1:04:41] five senses anymore. You have a super
[1:04:43] sense. You know there is something in
[1:04:46] the seed of God in that brother, the
[1:04:48] seed of God in that sister. No matter
[1:04:50] her mistakes, no matter what she got, if
[1:04:52] she's a God's daughter, I have to
[1:04:54] respect her. I have to love her. I have
[1:04:56] to pray for her. Let the circumstance
[1:04:58] control our lives.
[1:05:03] So that's far beyond the reach that come
[1:05:05] from God. It's called faith. Faith is
[1:05:08] that great things. Amen. Oh, praise be
[1:05:12] to God. Then he goes in this in the same
[1:05:14] super super sense says it's given this
[1:05:16] illustration of the senses of the
[1:05:18] natural man is born with these senses.
[1:05:20] So they are natural given senses that's
[1:05:23] really one thing that will ever known
[1:05:25] about it in his intellectual thinking.
[1:05:27] He can only think as a man
[1:05:31] you know you determine what a man is
[1:05:34] by how those five senses work. Five
[1:05:37] senses of the flesh, five senses of the
[1:05:39] mind. You see, oh that person is this
[1:05:41] way, that person is this way, or that
[1:05:43] person I was tall, that you characterize
[1:05:45] everything based upon those five senses.
[1:05:49] Amen. If you see the 10 senses, the
[1:05:52] spirit and oh that's a person. Oh, then
[1:05:54] you curify it. You see an animal, how do
[1:05:57] you know this animal different from the
[1:05:59] other animal? You see how they see and
[1:06:02] oh the eagle can see far and at that
[1:06:04] distance the other animal can swim. The
[1:06:07] smell, their five senses different. The
[1:06:10] five senses determine the
[1:06:12] characteristics of an animal and it's
[1:06:15] good. Amen. But a Christian is
[1:06:18] determined by a super sense that is way
[1:06:22] beyond the other five senses. So the
[1:06:25] natural man would walk like the natural
[1:06:27] man. They do things like the natural
[1:06:28] man. But we should not depend on the
[1:06:31] natural things only. God, help me to see
[1:06:34] what you see. Help me to hear what you
[1:06:38] hear. Help me to have the discernment of
[1:06:41] your discernment. Amen. That's our
[1:06:44] prayer. Lord, help me to see what you
[1:06:46] see because faith sees what God sees.
[1:06:49] Amen. When you look, what do you see?
[1:06:53] In any problem that will come in our
[1:06:55] life, a problem comes. Oh yeah. The
[1:06:57] natural man will look at the problem.
[1:06:59] Oh, according to the five senses that we
[1:07:01] have given to handle that things. But
[1:07:04] that way he can stop. That's where he
[1:07:05] has been built to. But the Christian is
[1:07:08] built differently. The same problem. But
[1:07:10] God, I want to see you beyond that
[1:07:13] problem. Amen.
[1:07:19] The prophet says that's where faith,
[1:07:21] genuine Christian faith rest. Resting
[1:07:24] place is the word. And for it know that
[1:07:26] God will ever prove himself superior
[1:07:29] over everyone of his enemies. No matter
[1:07:32] how bad it looks, how the enemy has come
[1:07:35] in or look like you are defeated, faith
[1:07:38] still knows. Amen. In reality, you might
[1:07:41] be surrounded. In reality, things might
[1:07:44] go wrong, but faith will take it out.
[1:07:47] Faith will never be defeated. Amen.
[1:07:51] In 1 Corinthians 2:11 says, "What man
[1:07:53] knoweth the things of a man, save the
[1:07:55] spirit of man which is in him. Even so
[1:07:58] the things of God knoweth no man by the
[1:08:01] spirit of God. Only the spirit of God
[1:08:04] can understand God. Only the spirit of
[1:08:06] God can see what God sees. Amen. That's
[1:08:09] why the new birth is important because
[1:08:12] without the new birth, you cannot see.
[1:08:13] You cannot understand the kingdom of
[1:08:15] God. That's why it's important to have
[1:08:17] the new birth. We come back on it. Amen.
[1:08:20] Amen. Amen.
[1:08:22] Prophet says in faith, just come to him
[1:08:25] and rest.
[1:08:27] If it's Jehovah Jara, rest on it.
[1:08:31] If it's Jehovah Rafa, rest on it.
[1:08:35] If it's the Lord that saves us by grace,
[1:08:38] rest on it. If it's the Lord who heals
[1:08:41] us by grace, rest on it. If it's the God
[1:08:44] that is coming from heaven with 10,000s
[1:08:47] of his saints, rest on it. If the dead
[1:08:50] in Christ shall rise first, rest on it.
[1:08:54] Everything is about rest. Amen. Oh my, I
[1:08:57] feel pretty religious right now. I'm I'm
[1:09:00] feeling too resting, not jumping about
[1:09:03] from pillow to post and carried about
[1:09:05] every kind of of wind of doctrine, but
[1:09:08] resting on what God said. Every promise
[1:09:11] in the book is yours. Every amen and yay
[1:09:15] is yours. What you got to be wor what
[1:09:18] you got to be worried about. Even old
[1:09:21] age, it shouldn't have anything to do
[1:09:23] with it. Sickness has nothing to do with
[1:09:26] it. God promised and God has to keep his
[1:09:29] promise. So see what we are trying to do
[1:09:33] is get the scare away from you. Amen.
[1:09:36] Because the enemy like to put fear in
[1:09:39] those two scriptures what we read they
[1:09:41] say fear not because once you start
[1:09:44] fearing it paralyzes your faith. Fear
[1:09:48] paralyzes your faith. But God want us to
[1:09:51] see a long vision of faith. I'm not
[1:09:54] looking at the present. I look at at at
[1:09:56] God's promise. Amen. Because the fear is
[1:10:00] to make us look at the present
[1:10:02] circumstances. That's right. How you
[1:10:04] feel, how you see how things are turning
[1:10:06] wrong. Oh no, I feel I'm overwhelmed and
[1:10:09] oh Lord, I I don't know what the
[1:10:11] tomorrow is going to be. Tomorrow God
[1:10:13] will make a way. Amen. He's the way
[1:10:16] maker.
[1:10:17] Yes, sir. Amen. Amen.
[1:10:21] Why Christ speak prophet says faith sees
[1:10:23] what God wants you to see. Hallelujah.
[1:10:26] Faith sees what God sees. Amen. And
[1:10:29] reasoning and senses see what the world
[1:10:33] wants you to see and see. Notice
[1:10:35] reasoning. Why? It's only human sense
[1:10:38] only reason this and this is it that
[1:10:41] this is just good and and and so on.
[1:10:44] That's just exactly when you use those
[1:10:46] senses which is contrary to the word.
[1:10:48] That's what the world want you to see.
[1:10:51] But faith don't look at that. Faith
[1:10:53] looks what God said. See, you know, you
[1:10:56] cast down reasons.
[1:11:00] The 12 spies that went into the promised
[1:11:04] land. They had the same five senses of
[1:11:07] the flesh, the same five senses of the
[1:11:09] mind. They saw the same circumstances,
[1:11:12] the same giant, the same problems, the
[1:11:15] same walls, the same training the others
[1:11:17] had. And and they look the same
[1:11:20] situations.
[1:11:21] But two of them, they had a different
[1:11:23] discernment. I see the same thing, but I
[1:11:26] don't look at the same thing. All the
[1:11:28] same thing that I see, they're just
[1:11:30] going to glorify the promise of God in
[1:11:32] my life. We are more than overcomers. We
[1:11:36] are more than conquerors by Jesus
[1:11:38] Christ. Amen. These giants no matter who
[1:11:40] they are, they are going to be defeated
[1:11:42] because it is our land. Amen. It is our
[1:11:45] possession. It is our inheritance for
[1:11:48] our family, for our situations, whatever
[1:11:51] we are going through. It is our
[1:11:52] inheritance. Praise be to God. The word
[1:11:55] of God says so. And I keep moving on.
[1:11:58] How it going to happen? I don't know.
[1:12:00] But God says it is my inheritance.
[1:12:04] I'll just walk around that that giant
[1:12:06] until God says move on. and I move on.
[1:12:09] Amen.
[1:12:10] Amen.
[1:12:16] Abraham and Lot the same thing. They
[1:12:18] looked the same situation, the same
[1:12:20] thing, the same wilderness. Oh, but one
[1:12:24] was called, the other one was just
[1:12:25] following.
[1:12:27] And look, no, it has been too hard. It
[1:12:29] too hard for me. He looked behind and he
[1:12:32] saw, oh, Sodom and Gomorrah. Oh, that's
[1:12:35] a better place. Oh, I I I I can make Oh,
[1:12:39] yeah. That's a
[1:12:42] Abraham said, "Oh, you can go. If you go
[1:12:44] that way, I will go the other way."
[1:12:46] Amen. I will stay. Brother, you need
[1:12:49] you're listening to is commenting
[1:12:51] between the two wives. The wife of of
[1:12:53] Abraham and the wife of of Lot.
[1:12:56] Sarah is probably complaining. Look at
[1:12:58] the wife of Lot. She doesn't she doesn't
[1:13:00] have to go through these things. Maybe
[1:13:02] she has lady and and maids that the
[1:13:05] cleaning or things and all and mine I'm
[1:13:07] just in the wilderness here nothing to
[1:13:09] do
[1:13:10] and he says he has been called by God
[1:13:12] really in this message I don't see
[1:13:14] anything why this happening my friend
[1:13:16] why look complain and complaining
[1:13:20] don't look at that don't you are looking
[1:13:22] too much with your eyes you need to look
[1:13:25] at God's promise this is our land this
[1:13:28] is it's rich it's written milk and honey
[1:13:32] this land this wilderness rich in milk
[1:13:34] and honey this land praise be to God
[1:13:37] today that that Israel still defending
[1:13:39] the same land today God's promise they
[1:13:42] will never fail
[1:13:45] amen
[1:13:48] hopefully I don't lose you there
[1:13:51] prophet says here's the thing I want you
[1:13:54] I want to ask you tonight for the next
[1:13:56] few minutes but when you look the
[1:13:59] question is what do you see when you
[1:14:01] look. What do you see when you do look?
[1:14:05] That only depends on what you are
[1:14:07] looking for. Now he said, "Look unto me
[1:14:11] all the ends of the earth." Moses lifted
[1:14:14] up the serpent and ever who looked got
[1:14:16] healed. Now it depends on what you are
[1:14:19] looking for. If you come you are looking
[1:14:23] for says another place says if you will
[1:14:27] focus your mind to God's words the tree
[1:14:30] will be one says when you have a
[1:14:32] binocular you're looking sometimes you
[1:14:34] see things distorted says you know the
[1:14:37] problem is not that thing it's still one
[1:14:39] God still promise the promise of God
[1:14:41] it's still the Lord Jesus Christ but you
[1:14:44] need to refocus so that you look
[1:14:46] properly and it will see that everything
[1:14:48] has to be about Jesus Christ amen Amen.
[1:14:51] Sometimes you think you look at the
[1:14:53] situation or the Oh, it looks like it's
[1:14:54] you handling the situation. No, it's not
[1:14:57] you. Refocus a little bit. You'll see
[1:14:59] that it's Jesus Christ in control of
[1:15:02] every situation. Amen. So, it depends on
[1:15:05] what you are looking at. What do you see
[1:15:07] when you look when you do look?
[1:15:09] Remember, you can only see him as you
[1:15:12] look at him through the word. You can't
[1:15:14] look at him through a textbook. What do
[1:15:17] you see him when you look? Do you see
[1:15:20] that? Do you see that? He was wounded
[1:15:22] for our transgressions. With his
[1:15:24] stripes, we were healed. Look, what do
[1:15:27] you see? Do you see deliverance? Do you
[1:15:30] see what he is? Look through the word
[1:15:32] and see what he was. Then you look
[1:15:34] through the same word and see and see he
[1:15:38] is the same today as he was then. He is
[1:15:41] the antitype of the brass serpent in the
[1:15:43] wilderness for the same cause sin and
[1:15:46] sickness. Amen. So that what I'm saying
[1:15:49] this Lord help me to look properly and
[1:15:54] to see what the word of God says not
[1:15:58] what my feeling says not what I'm think
[1:16:00] not my thinking but looking to your word
[1:16:03] you know at some point Elijah coming
[1:16:06] back to Elijah not Elijah but Elijah
[1:16:08] some point when he promised that there
[1:16:10] will be there will be a drought in the
[1:16:12] land for three years there no rain and
[1:16:15] everything but some point when the three
[1:16:17] years passed
[1:16:18] And Elijah was looking for the rain. He
[1:16:21] was waiting for the rain. He asked his
[1:16:23] servant, "Go look if you see anything."
[1:16:26] The servant went and looked. He said, "I
[1:16:28] don't see anything. I I don't see." So,
[1:16:30] go look again. You must see something
[1:16:33] because it's God's promise. It has to be
[1:16:35] fulfilled. And he went and he looked. I
[1:16:37] don't see anything. Seven times, seven
[1:16:40] churches, he didn't see anything. He
[1:16:43] didn't see anything. And then he saw a
[1:16:45] little bit of I see a little cloud like
[1:16:47] a hand. And then then I see a little a
[1:16:50] little sign over there. Sometimes God
[1:16:53] can give you just a little sign, a
[1:16:55] little thing inside of the heart. A
[1:16:56] little thing, not too much. But let me
[1:16:59] tell you, that's already the blessings
[1:17:00] of God coming. Just that little sign God
[1:17:03] gave you. Hold upon it. And Elijah says,
[1:17:06] "Go tell the king to start rejoicing
[1:17:09] because there are many rains of blessing
[1:17:12] that's going to form. starts already
[1:17:14] rejoicing by seeing that little hand
[1:17:16] just that little cloud in your life.
[1:17:19] Amen. In my life. Amen.
[1:17:24] Finishing with this three quotes
[1:17:30] invisible unif says
[1:17:33] it was put there by predestination. You
[1:17:35] were for then to a son of God to be a
[1:17:37] son of God. You were God before the
[1:17:40] foundation world. You are only
[1:17:42] manifested this day for his honor and
[1:17:44] glory. How can you do it without
[1:17:46] honoring his word and stand with every
[1:17:49] word of God? Yes sir. Which you are a
[1:17:52] part of that word by predestinations
[1:17:56] because look the God is the word. That's
[1:17:59] what I want to tell you the bride this
[1:18:00] morning. You are part of God by
[1:18:03] predestination. mean nothing can change
[1:18:06] God's program in your life because you
[1:18:08] are part of that word of God says we are
[1:18:12] coming perfect faith we are coming now
[1:18:14] to perfection because the people has to
[1:18:16] come to this in order for the rapture
[1:18:19] that's what is holding it away right now
[1:18:21] he's waiting for that church to come
[1:18:23] into that perfect raptured faith looking
[1:18:26] for it means a lot of shaving down from
[1:18:29] me it means a lot for you but together
[1:18:33] we'll make it by the grace of God. Lord,
[1:18:36] I need that perfect faith in my life. I
[1:18:40] need a perfect faith in the church. I
[1:18:41] need that perfect faith in my family.
[1:18:43] But let me let me be willing to be
[1:18:46] shaved to go through the shaving. But if
[1:18:48] it takes a lot of shaving, let it be
[1:18:50] done in my life as long as I can be able
[1:18:52] to see you the way you want me to see
[1:18:55] you. Amen. Remember that Elisha as he
[1:18:59] was talking about that servant next to
[1:19:00] him says, "Oh Lord, help him. open his
[1:19:04] eyes so that he can see because he
[1:19:07] doesn't see it. Lord, open his eyes. you
[1:19:10] know that Gaz at some point he had to
[1:19:11] have a a scene of a leprosy sickness
[1:19:14] later on
[1:19:17] and then but I don't want to go that but
[1:19:20] God answered to his prayer to the
[1:19:21] prophet says no open his eyes and his
[1:19:24] eyes was open and he looked and saw many
[1:19:27] angels the love that the prophet had for
[1:19:30] his servant to be able to open their
[1:19:32] eyes and to see let it be our prayer
[1:19:35] this evening praying for one another
[1:19:38] that God can open the eyes of one
[1:19:41] another. Amen. Amen. Pray for one
[1:19:44] another. The prophet says when one
[1:19:47] member will will talk against the other
[1:19:49] member, you know that's wrong. You are
[1:19:51] commanded to pray for one another, not
[1:19:54] to talk against one another, but to love
[1:19:57] one another. If someone is down, let's
[1:20:00] pick him up, help him. Now, that makes
[1:20:03] us a unified group of believers. When we
[1:20:07] don't obey that then we don't obey God
[1:20:09] and we displease God. Therefore our
[1:20:11] church our people cannot prosper. The
[1:20:14] church cannot go on is because we are
[1:20:17] disunified together. As Jesus said a
[1:20:20] little leaven lampens a little leaven
[1:20:24] leavenvens the lamp and in the message
[1:20:26] of the time super sense the prophet goes
[1:20:28] in that much detail. And this just
[1:20:30] touched my heart. Says if someone says
[1:20:33] sister so and brother so and so don't
[1:20:36] you believe one word of it you just
[1:20:38] leave it go because remember it's the
[1:20:41] devil trying to tear you to pieces.
[1:20:44] Now just look to him to go in because
[1:20:47] he'll do it. Now you let the good man
[1:20:50] you let the good man of the house faith
[1:20:52] stand right there and don't you receive
[1:20:55] one thing. These people have been set in
[1:20:58] heavenly places with you. fellowship
[1:21:00] together around the blessings of God.
[1:21:02] Taking the communion on the table and
[1:21:04] the Holy Spirit has witnessed that they
[1:21:06] are the children of God. So just let's
[1:21:09] just be real sweet, kindhearted,
[1:21:12] forgiving, loving. If the other person
[1:21:15] talks evil against you, you talk sweet
[1:21:18] against them. Watch how sweet comes to
[1:21:21] you then. See, that's right. Just always
[1:21:24] return good for evil, love for hate.
[1:21:28] Pray one for another. That's what we're
[1:21:31] going to do this evening. Musicians can
[1:21:34] come. Let's pray for one another.
[1:21:37] Look around you. Look your brother, your
[1:21:39] sister. Those who are here, those who
[1:21:41] might not be here. Think of someone in
[1:21:44] your heart, in the church, the family.
[1:21:46] Lord, I want to pray for my brother. I
[1:21:48] want to pray for my sister. I don't want
[1:21:51] to look. I don't want to see the flesh.
[1:21:52] I want to the five senses. Help me to
[1:21:55] see beyond the flesh. to see them the
[1:21:57] way you see them. You know, Balam made a
[1:22:00] mistake of Israel by looking at Israel
[1:22:02] in the natural, their own mistakes and
[1:22:04] they had a lot of mistakes and he failed
[1:22:06] to see the blessings of God. How God
[1:22:08] were looking at Israel. Amen. May God
[1:22:11] help us to see and look what God says.
[1:22:14] Amen.
[1:22:16] [Music]
[1:22:21] Said that to be small, but I just went
[1:22:24] over again.
[1:22:31] The more the more I surrender, the more
[1:22:33] I surrender myself,
[1:22:36] [Music]
[1:22:39] the the more I
[1:22:42] surrender.
[1:22:46] The lighter
[1:22:48] my love,
[1:22:51] the more that I release my feet, the
[1:22:56] more he takes control.
[1:23:01] The more that I can humble myself,
[1:23:07] the more he lifts me up.
[1:23:11] every day.
[1:23:15] Lord, I love you more.
[1:23:20] All that I surrender
[1:23:24] [Music]
[1:23:27] to my Lord,
[1:23:30] the more that I release my fear, the
[1:23:36] more
[1:23:41] the more that I can humble myself,
[1:23:46] the more he lifts me
[1:23:50] Every day I
[1:23:54] Lord I love you more.
