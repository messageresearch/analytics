In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Thank you for the specials and everyone. Just God bless you richly and I just want just greet one another. Just greet one another for a moment. Have a big smile on your face and uh just be could be in the house the Lord and say good to see you and I'm happy to see you. Just good. We already greeted. God bless you. God bless you. Very good. God bless you. God bless you. Wonderful. Brother, I won't miss you this time. Bless you. You miss you. Bless you. Wonderful. Just good to be in the house of the Lord and and thank you musicians and thank you brother Andrew songs and we draw from the same source. Some some of the songs he picked from me so for the closing but it's good. Amen. It means we are in the same channel. Amen. I invite you to take your Bibles in second Peter's second Peter chapter 1. I had a rough night on from Friday to Saturday to the point I was wondering. And so now when I wake up, I think the Lord allows me to to sleep a little bit. I've just called I don't think I'll be able to prepare for Sunday and call brother Max and an evangelist is usually always on time. Evangelist does not need a lot of preparation, you know. So he's a I just you call spare tire there in Edmonton. So I would just call him and then as the day was going and I was feeling better and better. So God I'll just just speak on the on the virtue of temperance today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Second Peter 1 5 and 6 small verse. And besides this, giving all diligence add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godliness, and to godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness charity. For if these things be in you and abound, they make you that you shall neither be barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But he that lackth these things is blind and cannot see a far off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. Wherefore the rather brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure. For if you do these things, you shall never fall. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. May God bless his word. You can have a seat. We had a wonderful service on Friday with the young people. Just wonderful. And uh God bless them richly and just bless those meetings. So we try to do them regularly. We talk about um accountability and how God likes to see reliable people, reliable Christians. &gt;&gt; And uh in the professional work, it's the same thing. You can't have you. Oh, I'm an employee, but I come whenever I want. No, you're not going to be you're not going to last there for a long time. So I'll do whenever it pleases me then I'll do it and then then then you you can't build anything &gt;&gt; if you're not reliable. God wants people are reliable. &gt;&gt; And I think as a Christian as a church and even a family you have to be reliable. &gt;&gt; Imagine you have a husband today is husband tomorrow is not husband. I come whenever I come to I come whenever I want. &gt;&gt; I will take care of you whenever I want you know but &gt;&gt; no you have to be reliable. It's &gt;&gt; just and they responded that may God bless them richly. They just responded to that in a very nice way and I'm committed and just want to build on that and more and more. Amen. God bless you. And uh Sunday on on this coming weekend we have brother Boris who's coming special meetings uh Saturday at 5:30 and the song service start at 5:30. So half an hour before you can come but the song start at 5:30 and uh it's a very good minister brother Boris so you you'll be blessed &gt;&gt; come expecting invite visitors whoever and then just come it will be to be a blessing weekend uh so we start a little bit early so we can finish early because um uh so Sunday we can start a little bit early as well so um be a bit change so the song will start at 9:30 on Sunday just to allow him because he has a flight in the evening at 8 and he's taking a service at in Spruce Grove. So just him to have a little bit to finish a bit early if he finishes around between 11:30 and 12 then we can have a early lunch for him and then just to accommodate him and then then he can preach there and take his flight. So I just want to make his day comfortable. So thank you for taking that s that sacrifice &gt;&gt; for Sunday as well. Amen. So today I just want to speak on the on the fourth virtue there. Temperance after faith after virtue after knowledge. Now we have temperance. Temperance is a prophet doesn't talk too much about it. It's just one if you have this book it's just one page or one two pages. So one leaf but two pages but just wonderful things that he's saying there. So we're just going to comment on some of them in this morning as a study. I hope it's fine. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just go. And says paragraph 221 he says temperance does not mean stop drinking alcohol here either. Says not it's not it's not it's not necessary stop drinking alcohol here neither. No, no, temperance doesn't mean alcohol, alcoholic cure. Not in this case. This is Bible temperance. This is Holy Spirit temperance. So the title of my message that why I took it, it's a holy spirit temperance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As is saying that it does not mean to stop drinking alcohol doesn't mean that you have you can continue to drink alcohol. just say you know in this case it doesn't apply to that because it's it's going to be something way further than that but not in another case by other alcohols it's already be something you should already the holy spirit would have already dealt there before when you're at the level of the new birth because before you get new birth you need you need you need justification you need sanctification you need the holy ghost and then during sanctification as the holy spirit is cleansing you then we take rid of the alcohol, take rid of the wine and all things. I like what what the minister preached the other time brother Steve he says you know uh all the spirit most of the time are just are just um are just comforters spirits are comforters they they just want to comfort you they are substitute mean you are lacking something you maybe you are burden on something I just want to I just want to release myself then you will get on something it might be might be spirit of games and you just video games and something that that's where you feel relaxed and things like that or different things and then if it takes over then it becomes a spirit right and then then the same thing with maybe smoke maybe been battling with smoke and it it at the beginning it started as as a relief something that is helping you to to to feel comfortable those who are going drugs it just start with something you know feel a bit relaxed and I feel I feel high as they call it I feel you know out of worry is out the thing then I feel a little bit better but it's a spirit but but don't let it take it over don't take it on when it take over then it becomes it becomes it's not good so the the best the best thing is don't even start there don't even go there amen that's why the prophet was told the prophet never never never ne never use alcohol never never smoke never alcohol never never defile your body if the woman are things are spirit man once you start on that it will take you over and then even when sometimes you become a Christians that the things that they leave scars on you and you feel like they're still there you are battling upon that then don't even go there don't even start there don't you know you are you are a Nazerite you know a Nazerite a Nazerite is is is one who's dedicated to God if you're dedicated to God you don't even want to touch none of these things don't even get closer to them amen don't even have friends who who like those things because it becomes becomes it becomes a temptation. It becomes something you have to struggle with. Shine any appearance of evil. Leave those things aside. Separate yourself from those things. They have no part in you. God want to use your body for his glory. But don't don't let that the enemy comes upon it and use it for him. But you let your body be used by God through sanctification. Amen. So you separate yourself from those things. It can it can can it can be anything. Can be it can be alcohol, it can be smoked, it can be wine, it can be oh no, I just want to take a little bit. Oh, brother said watch out because once you start there, it'll go over. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But there's a sign of a Nazerite. You know Nazarite is Samson was a Nazarite. John the Baptist will say abstain from from those things. Take away from those things. You know when you go to work why they don't put on work why do on work they put you know don't don't bring alcohol to work don't smoke at work all those things they put that if they can do that to work why why you want to do that in church &gt;&gt; no one I think was sharing with someone say I was surprised someone was telling me I forgot to was so I was surprised I saw the priest drunk so you are surprised Well, we we used to have a priest on our family back home. He was a priest. But when there is a party, you forgot that he's a priest. He's completely drunk. Can you imagine a priest drunk? Someone who's supposed to help you. Someone who be supposed to be an example. Then he's drunk. Lost his mind and he's doing anything. Alcohol breaks families. Alcohol breaks marriages. Alcohol destroys families. All that things. So don't the Christians should not be it's not my subject but I just want to put as a comment the prophet saying there no don't go there don't start there don't let it don't be a slave of those things amen &gt;&gt; because it's a mocker wine is a mocker strong drink is a raging whatever it is deceived there that what the Bible says in proverbs 21 is a deceiver but the proverbs 31 says it is not for kings or lameu it is not for kings to drink wine not for princes strong drink Let lest they drink and forget the law and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted. What is it? It means means it means if you are a king or queen, you should not even be there. And you are queen king and queens. Amen. King or queen because they lose your judgment. You lose your your your your mental judgment. Your your mental capacity puts you in a certain status. It makes you hit your wife. It makes you uh hit your children. It makes you lose money. Just negative things, negative for a moment where you think like you lost, you'll be the happy but it brings you more more problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say that's not my subject but just want to put a comment. It says it's not about drinking that doesn't mean permission you can go on that not to drinking. You know Jesus all those things are just habit and most of the things are just habit. Temperance in normal way in a normal way if you're not talking about temperance temperament means abstain from doing certain things and that's what's the the usual temperance that we call you know restrain yourself. It's self-control restrain yourself from certain things but you know certain things usually they are just habit but you know habit start by smolding. &gt;&gt; Sure. Usually you just you know have you seen a baby we I had my niece she used to to lick her finger suck a thumb. Thank you. That's the right expression. I always like to be the front because she call she's my dictionary English dictionary. So stack of a thumb it started as small thing but then it take over and over and then and then when she grew up it was hard to get rid of it. We put we put we we tried to put things we put bit things and then she put a moment she put and then she just put it put it back again. Oh wow. Then we tried different things and then when she grew up when she then she had a little bit of ah a little bit of something and then when she got when she wanted to get married then she condemned the parent. Why did you leave me with you should have done all the things why now look how I look if you know how we struggle in order to change you but it started as a small things it's just a habit that how habit start just prophet preached from that time on &gt;&gt; you know sometimes oh I the first time that you do something that is wrong it hurts the conscience I shouldn't have not done it and the second time you do it again It hurts you. The third time becomes usual and then and then before you find it, you already gone in certain habit. &gt;&gt; But you know how how to change habit. It's just a habit &gt;&gt; and then the spirit goes in that habit. &gt;&gt; But you know there is also another way to change a habit. Change a different habit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Start with a small steps and so this is what has been leading me but now I'm taking the opposite. Prophet says you know sometimes the solution to something take the opposite of it &gt;&gt; or usually I'm you know I'm prone to be late or start a little bit early &gt;&gt; 5 minutes a little bit early then become 10 early then becomes 20 early don't just becomes oh that's my habit that's how I'm made no that's not how you made you studied one day and you end up being this way amen so oh this is my this is my way this is my way of being this is my just my way no that's not your way you are not born that way. You made yourself that way. But now take a step. Amen. Take a habit. Jesus had good habit. Good habit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had good habit. The Bible says he was that it was his habit to go and pray. &gt;&gt; That's a good habit. It start maybe for you for us it will start slow. Maybe it's just five minute. But then it becomes a habit. It becomes a habit. I know it's not the Holy Ghost yet, but I I rather have good habit without the Holy Ghost than bad habit without the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we train our children in a good way. That's why the Bible says chain train your child from youth. &gt;&gt; What even means put good habit on the child. &gt;&gt; Then when he's older, it becomes harder for him to get away from it. Even if he doesn't have the Holy Ghost yet, but when you start with the good habit, the good thing, the good training, then he will be leaning that way. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the devil even if he comes with different temptation himself, he has not been trained that way. It will be hard for him to move the other way. &gt;&gt; Ask example to those who have been married late in life. It's hard marriages when you are married late because you have been stubborn all the way and now to correct the other way. No, this is the way my mother and the I'm your wife is not your mother. &gt;&gt; That was your mother. This is your wife. You have to change different things now. &gt;&gt; But when you're married late, then it becomes harder. I was married late. I was stubborn. She suffered a lot. I'm taking example for myself because it's hard when you're married. I that all my life has been and you thought that it was right but now we have to correct it becomes hard but now when you come from the church we need to change some habit amen have good habit let now let the holy spirit comes upon those habit and becomes automatic you know sometimes you don't have to think about it and it becomes the holy ghost the prophet will go a bit further than that says not only on the natural but it has to go on a certain high level than that amen In the natural, the Bible says Paul uses in the 1 Corinthians 9:25 says, "Every man that striveth for the mastery is temporate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we incorruptible an incorruptible crown." Just like athletes they discipline their bodies to win a race, believers must also exercise self-control in certain areas where you have yourself to be tempered into certain areas. You don't you make you make you become a discipline of certain things. You become disciplined not in the natural you become disciplined. A Christian is a disciplined person. &gt;&gt; A Christian should be the best worker. You know, you know when when the message came, sorry to have I can only relate to what I I've lived. When the message came in our country, people many companies wanted to hire only message believers. That's true. &gt;&gt; Because they were examples. Oh, if you if you if you hire a message believer, oh, you you will be he will be on time. You'll be in he will be sincere. He'll be he won't be in corruption. It it was it was the it was it was the testimony everywhere. Amen. &gt;&gt; Papa Matendo has the same testimony for his work. They have to hire him because think because he was a message believer. If you if you if you hire a message believer, oh for sure it's going to stay very very very full of integrity. Amen. But but over time then sometimes you see that become different things but we don't want to go that way. When a person realizes that he's an inferior complex, the prophet says, or some sort of complex, how may he overcome this, should it be, should it be if he was the only child caused this in his early youth? The prophet says to answer that question, if he finds he have an inferior complex or some sort of complex, how may he overcome this? Prophet says take exactly the opposite. If you are always wanting your way and that one little brat that you want to always have everything your way, turn right back around and give everything you got to the other way. If you are selfish and you want to hold everything, then start giving away what you got. Not only your attention upon yourself, now start giving away. That means you have been having a certain habit where everything has to be upon you. Now you start in the opposite way. You start giving. Start little. Amen. Just go the vice versa that the way to overcome anything is an antidote. My old southern mother used to say hair off the dog back is good for the bite. That applies this way too. Amen. So if you find yourself doing something wrong, just take the opposite. Amen. That's why as I say that's why it's important to start with the children in the right way because it will be hard for them to depart from it when they become older. That's why the Bible says, "These words that I command thee, turn unto me." Say, "These word that I command thee this day shall be in thine heart, and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and they shall talk and shall talk of them when thou sitest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thy lies down, and when thy when thy rises up." It's very important to instruct the children diligently, not occasionally, not sometimes, but you stay persistent. You stay if if it's if an instructions you have to stay if you have you have to stay consistent and persistent in that instruction. Don't waver here then wherever here. Oh, I'm just trying to be nice. Today you are here. Today you are here is not going to work. &gt;&gt; You have to be persistent on a certain instructions and stay firm in that instructions. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what the Bible says. But what we want is the Holy Ghost. We want the Holy Ghost to fill our heart. We want the Holy Ghost to have the full preeminence. We want the Holy Ghost to be the one who's in control of every situation. Even in natural what you do the mechanic in order, but you want the Holy Ghost to come and take over. Amen. We want the Holy Ghost to control in every situation. The Bible says be not drunk with wine wherein is a sexist. This is just an example. But be filled with the spirit. You know in many things what we desire is the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit will make a a difference. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we don't emphasize very often on the Holy Spirit, but let me tell you, the Holy Spirit is the only thing that can give life because the Holy Spirit is God himself. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit changes. The Holy Spirit delivers. The Holy Spirit is the spirit that raised Christ from the dead. If it could raise Christ from the dead, the Holy Spirit has power to break every chain, to break every bondage, to break every feather. The Holy Spirit can deliver you. Amen. The Holy Spirit is here. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe the Holy Spirit, there's nothing that can can resist the Holy Spirit. If you believe the word of God and yield yourself to the word of God, if you humble yourself, the Holy Spirit can deliver you. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that is more powerful than the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Don't say, "No, I can't. I tried it one time, it didn't work." And then, but let me tell you, just yield your yield yourself to the God. God will deliver you. Amen. You know sometimes when people say you know I'm still on the first paragraph there first line. You see people tell Christians once you become a Christians you're not going to be free anymore. So I'm free now. I'm free. I'm a I'm not a Christian so am I free. I can do anything I want. You know a Christian does everything he wants. &gt;&gt; A Christian does everything he wants. A real Christian does everything he wants. Actually, the one who's a slave is the one who's not a Christian. I will show you why. Because the one who's a the one who's the one who a Christian, if you're a Christian, a born again Christian, you do everything you want, but you do the things that you want from your heart. &gt;&gt; A crow and a dove, they do everything they want. But a dove cannot take the things that the crow does because they're different nature. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit can only feed upon the word of God. &gt;&gt; And the crow can eat anything and he's satisfied. The crow can tell to the dove, you are not free. You know, be like me. I can eat anything I want. So yeah, but the dove can say I'm free too &gt;&gt; and I eat only what I want. &gt;&gt; Why you want to push me to eat the things that you take? Because we are not of the same nature. Once I have the Holy Ghost, my desires change. My inner being change and I'm feeding only upon what the Holy Spirit want. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I cannot follow what the world the world want because I'm not of the same nature. Once I have the Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost has changed me, has transformed me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the the the real bornagain Christian is free. &gt;&gt; Why is free? Because he has been set free by the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; They're being set free by the son of God. &gt;&gt; Who the one the son of God set free is free indeed. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said if you hear the truth, the truth shall set you free. &gt;&gt; The word of God will set you free. Amen. And God is here to set you free. &gt;&gt; And you will do whatever the Holy Spirit wants you to do. Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't follow what the world wants. There is always there is always a battle between the flesh and and the soul and the spirit. I I'm aware of that. But don't succumb to the flesh constantly. If you fall, stand up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you find yourself captive, stand up. Amen. Because you are a king. You are a queen. You are you are the the the chosen generation. You are the royal seed of Abraham. You are the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You are the one who is elected for the rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are here to make it. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not here to be bound by the earth. You are here to go into the rapture. &gt;&gt; You are a son and a daughter of God. Amen. I'm here to proclaim that Satan has no has no authority over you. If you're a son and daughter of God, you are born to be free and you are free. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't be bound by anything of the enemy. You know the the crow and the prophet the prophet talk about that story that that the crow he was already free but he was thinking that he was still bound because he for a long time all his life he has lived with that thing and and then Johnny Johnny thought that oh no I'm still bound by that thing no if after this service how am I going to get out of this you know I'm so used to just to go in my relaxed time just to go on YouTube and watch whatever I want and everything what am I going to don't think about what you are going to do. Just accept the word of God. I'm free &gt;&gt; and God will do the work. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet says now if you go away well I can do that. I always do what I want to do. But if you're a Christians you don't want to do the things that's wrong because the very life in you the very foundation if you want to do wrong it shows the wrong thing is in here. How can bitter and sweet water come from the same fountain? So you've been all mixed up on some kind of emotion, fabulous something and other sensation. Forget it. Go back to the altar and say, "God, take my old sinful life away and put me in such a condition that my whole desire, he that is born of God does not commit sin." That's right. He has no desire to do so. Amen. Some say that Christian is not free. Look at him. He might actually be the one who is addicted himself. Addiction is a form of bondage. When someone is mastered by mastered by by by a sinful habit or desire, they become a servant or slave to it. Says, "Oh, if I can't take a cigarette, you know, I feel shaky." But you tell to the Christian, you know, you are not free. You are the one who are not free. You are you are slave to that secret &gt;&gt; because if you don't get it then you become shaky if I don't have it sometimes if I don't have this this oh what kind of life are you &gt;&gt; if I'm don't if I don't do this I'm if I don't if if and now in a new generation that becomes now you see not only children even grown up people. So it's not after church, you know what I time is to spend just to be there playing games and everything. If I don't if I don't do it, I feel like what's going on, something is missing. &gt;&gt; I would like to be bondage to Christ. &gt;&gt; I'll be slave to Christ, prisoner to Christ. &gt;&gt; If I don't go to church, I feel like I'm dying. I would like to have that desire. &gt;&gt; If if I don't pray, I feel like something is is is missing. I would like to have that desire then to go on the other side and you know what if I don't have that I want to be a prison of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to be free and prison of Christ. &gt;&gt; The prophet says the Bible says all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient. All things are lawful for me but I will not be brought under the power of any. A believer is not born under the power of anything &gt;&gt; except the power of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Except the control of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Addiction is something like substance, habit or desire that controls of a person. &gt;&gt; And a Christian should not be bound by any addiction. If anything is bounding, you feel like you can't you can't get rid of it and it have a hold upon you, be careful. &gt;&gt; It's an addiction. &gt;&gt; Amen. Doesn't mean that you are lower. Doesn't mean that you are lost. But because as still as you have life in you, I just want to remind you, you are a son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you feel like you are bound by anything, today is your day of deliverance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has the power to deliver you. As your sister sang, the more I surrender. If you just yield to God, God has the power to deliver you &gt;&gt; if you just surrender yourself to him. Because you must not be under the power of anything except to be under the power of the Holy Ghost. To be a prisoner of Christ. You have been put on earth to be a son and daughter of God. A prisoner to Christ. Not to be prisoner of any other thing. So come to the court of the prophet says here in the statue of perfect man. Temperance doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol either here either. No no temperance doesn't mean al alcoholic. Not in this case. This is Bible temperance. Holy Spirit temperance. Not just one of the last of the flesh. But we are talking about the Holy Spirit temperance. That means how to control your tongue, not to be a tattler, how to control your temper, not to fly off every time anybody speaks cross to you. Oh my. The temperance we are talking about goes beyond addiction cure. As I said, addiction cure one of the steps to be free by the Holy Ghost. So, it goes beyond that. The temperance that the talking here is the temperance of the character. The Holy Ghost temperance is a virtue produced in the life of a believer who walks with God by the Holy Ghost. It is spirit empowered self-control. You can't just say from from that day on I will have temperance. It will fail. Says no. From that on I will from after the service I will be so much with temperance now. it won't work. But if you realize that you lacking that godliness temperance, the Holy Spirit temperance is just to surrender. Lord, help me in that area. Help me in that area that I will have the Holy Spirit temperance. Paul says in Galatians 5:22, "But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance. Against such there is no law." So temperance is a fruit of the Holy Spirit. It's not something you can build up yourself. It has to come from God once you recognize that I need it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It controls your tongue not to be a tattler. You know I like what James says is James as a spirit he as a minister of a pastor he was someone who's on down on earth as among the epistles is one who really put the emphasis about the power of tongue &gt;&gt; in James 3 that's right &gt;&gt; as a pastor he realize what happens in the churches and things know it's usually the problem is the tongue we talk too much we try to express too much that's where the problem is so he addresses that In James 3, let's read it together. James 3 says, "My brethren, be not many masters." That's sometimes where the problem is. Become too many masters. Everybody has, we thank God for, we thank God for the table. We thank God for all the messages. Sometimes when we have all the messages, everyone becomes a master. So I know it. I know it. I know it. I know it. And then it says, "No, be not many masters. know that we shall receive the greater condemnation, but in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to brittle the whole body. Behold, we put beats in the horse's mouth, that they may obey us, and we turn about the whole body. Behold also the the the ships the the the ships which though they be so great and driven or fierce wings yet are they turned about with a very small helm with sosoever the governor listeth. Even so the tongue is a little member and boast of great things. Behold how great a matter a little fire can live. The tongue usually is the problem in the whole body. The tongue can the one be boasting the most and great things and saying things just a small thing. A small member but a very dangerous member. The tongue is a fire a world of iniquity. So is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and set on fire the cause of nature and is set on fire on fire of hell. It's not what Jesus Christ says. It's not what defiles is not what comes in. It's what comes out. Comes out the tongue. Problem of the tongue. Says for every kind of beast and of birds, of serpent, of things in the sea is tamed and have been tamed of mankind. But the tongue can no maintain. It is unruly evil full of deadly poison. &gt;&gt; In the church, the daily poison sometimes is a tongue. Therewith bless we God, even the Father. There we There we bless we God, even the Father. There we've cursed we man, which are made after the similitude similitude of God. Out of the same mouth proceedth blessing and cursing, my brethren, these things ought not so to be ought not so to be. The prophet says in the message says the temperance that we are talking is to control your tongue not to be a tattler. A tattler is a person who reports another's wrongdoing. &gt;&gt; There's so many may God be merciful upon us so that we don't become tattlers. &gt;&gt; Those who report other people's wrongdoing. &gt;&gt; The prophet says I think brother shared that quote the other day. You know the real Christian way is to hide everything you can from a brother. Don't tell his bad things. Just tell his good things. Just tell what you know about him that is good. &gt;&gt; If you can take that as a principle will have less problem in the church. &gt;&gt; Only tell the things that are good about someone else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If anything is bad, let it alone. Poor fellow has got enough against him anyhow. Don't try to take a pole and shove a man further into the ditch. The Christian attitude is to pick him up and take him out of the ditch. He's already down. If he hear that you talk about his negative things to someone else, you just putting him down further. But you have to come and raise him up. A Christian is to take someone who's down and raise him up again. So you see, don't never try to shove him down. He's down already. Try to help him up. But too many of us today, too many people today, I might say, try to do that. If they could just get something another then they could say that was really bad. You know what the principle of the Bible says? It's right settle in the Bible how to do handle with problems in the church. Amen. Are you with me this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Talking about spiritual temperance. The principle is set properly in Matthew 18:14. He says, "Even so, it is not the will of your father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish." That's the first statement. God, you don't want that person to perish. God doesn't want that person to perish. Your desire has to be I don't want that person to perish. I want I want to help that person. I I you can't wish hell to even to the worst of the enemy. So don't that have to be the first attitude. I don't want that person to I I'm burdened for that person. And then you go further says moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him his fault between thee and the pastor. No. Go tell him and the deacon. No. &gt;&gt; Go tell him and put it on Facebook. M &gt;&gt; go tell him and spread that in Instagram. &gt;&gt; No, go tell him between thee and him alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you have that burden in your heart. You wish him good. Go say, you know, my brother, my sister, I I've been burdened. I prayed. I prayed about it and I I feel like it's something that is putting a bit down. Do you mind if I just spend a little time we talk together then we talk and I see like this was happening what do you think about it and sometimes I'm guilty of not doing that I agree but if we have to take that other approach we'll have less problem in the church less problem in the families sometimes then if shall he or thee and thou gain witness thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses, every word may be established. Now listen, if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church. But if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man or a publican. Verily, I say unto you, whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. And whatsoever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Again I say unto thee that if do or if if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. &gt;&gt; Those are wonderful promises of God. Wonderful promises of that. And we we I pray about that. We pray about it. God, we are here in the midst of that because two or three are gathered in your name. We are here more than two gather in your name. But do you know the premises of that that that promise here is if you have a burden for one another, if you can talk to one another freely, if you can confess your sins to one another freely, otherwise it will be just we think that we are agreeing but actually we are not agreeing because I have something against you but I can't tell you because for this reason or this reason and then we just pretend just to be together. No wonder sometimes God doesn't work because we don't agree together first and the prophet will say it himself taking side with Jesus. Are you with me this evening? &gt;&gt; I know it's a little bit of a pastoral things but I think it's important. I can't just skip it. I think it's important to mention it. Now for instance if one of you brethren will make a mistake and do something that is wrong which you are subject to it and I am too every one of us as I was sharing the young people so you know I was reading the prophet says one place says God will make your pastor to fail just to show that he's a man so that you don't put your trust on a man &gt;&gt; you should expect I will make mistakes and someone will make me your brother will make mistakes &gt;&gt; just to show to you that he's a man But now it's on your your attitude. What is your attitude? When you see your brother fall, when you see your pastor fall, your deacon fall and someone fall. What is your attitude? That where the problem is. We are all bound to fail and we will fail. Just to show that we are man and God we have to rely on God. We have to depend on God. &gt;&gt; Your wife, the wife will see the husband fall and fall sometimes very bad just to show that he's a man. &gt;&gt; But what is your attitude towards him? That's where the question is. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Says we are brothers but as long but as we go along let's remember we are brothers. We are brothers and if we got any fighting let's fight with one another. Bring it together. Bring it before our brethren and settle it. Now they used to in the braom the Branham family if one of the little ones done something they was going to tell Bill about it because I was the biggest and I have to stand there and see what is right and wrong. Well, my decision was that which one was right and wrong. And if they still don't believe it, then they get around behind my back and for it out again. They were still brothers. You see, they would fight in the backyard with one another and fight in the front yard for one another. How how come the standards become so low with now things I don't want to put on negative, but things being on the public and things where where where are we going? We are those brands who can fight in the behind behind the court there behind but in the front are fighting for one another. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that the way it was see well we are still brothers. We got to do this. If you got something against somebody you brother don't tell somebody else about it. &gt;&gt; If it's wrong go to him and tell him &gt;&gt; then if he's going to argue with you then take somebody else with you. Then bring it up the way the Bible says. But Jesus, they try to find every little shadow that they could find. Try to belittle him in the sight of the people. That's what the devil wants. They want they want to hurt your influence before the people. That's the way you want to watch careful what you do. Sometimes you don't know what you're doing. You are doing it. You are under spirit which is trying to hurt the influence of the person before the people. Don't do that. Walk like real man of God. Talk like real man of God. Act like real men of God. Live like men of God because the devil your adversary is going about like a roaring lion trying to devour what he can. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know what we are not doing anymore? People have be why why sometimes we don't want to correct people. So brother I have something to tell you and so yeah I feel like this can we pray together? I think that we can. Sometimes we don't do that anymore. You know why? Because people have become so sensitive. We have become so sensitive. Who are you to tell me? What what do you think you are? &gt;&gt; You think that you know better than me? Yeah. And and because of that people I don't want I don't want to tell you I don't want problems. Sometimes I feel like telling that person I just leave it alone. you know just go to church pray and go that's not your problem sometimes we have taken attitude I've taken sometime that attitude I don't want problem but actually it's not right &gt;&gt; you should come to the level where feel confident of brother I have that the burden I just want to help maybe I don't understand what is going here you know oh no brother maybe you don't see how it can be the other way oh the other way oh brother I didn't see that way thank god thank you for correct me. Thank you. Let's move on together. &gt;&gt; But we want big things, but we are we are forgetting that small basic things. &gt;&gt; Church. Oh, you hurt my feelings. My wife is taking some courses for for daycare, home care or something like that. And that teaching her telling me teaching don't rebuke children because you don't want to hurt their feelings. So, oh now I understand why my some of my kids don't always daddy you hurt my feelings. &gt;&gt; You have to apologize. You hurt my feelings. So, okay. I'm sorry. And I imagine start from early age. Don't don't hurt people's feelings. If you hurt my feelings, you know what? I leave the church. I go, you know, then you see what you're going to do to me. I leave the church. We become so sensitive. so sensitive. Oh, may God help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; The attitude has become if you correct me then you know it says the prophet says little door we want to keep that door private and that says sometimes the problem is the pride because we I know it's a bad feeling to be corrected. It's a bad feeling. We have to be honest, right? You know, some brother, you've been doing this and it's kind you feel embarrassed. It's it's bad. I know that, you know, you want to be right. I know. I understand. We are human beings. It's hard. But you know, sometimes what the problem is, it's just pride because we we don't want we don't want to feel we don't want to be corrected. We don't want to be rebuked. It's hard. And but the problem sometimes just pride that door we want to keep it private. Don't touch there. No ministers, don't touch there. Pastor, don't touch deacon. Don't touch my brother. Don't touch my own life. Mind your business. This is my my life. It's my my business. I you I being a bit natural here, but I just want to put emphasis on the temperance. Mind your business. This is my me. If prophet says maybe it's that private door of pride. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. The prophet says, "The next door is pride." I tell you, Lord, don't don't you tell me what I'm I'm up to put on on what I'm I'm to take off. You stay out of that room. You mind your business. I'll mind mine. Now, I wouldn't say that, but your action proves you that you do that. You say that. Like my old southern mommy tells me the actions speak louder than words. Your actions are so strong you can't hear a testimony. When you take people that act indifferent, don't tell me preacher what I have to do. I don't care what the Bible says. I know what I think in my own head. That's right. You are not thinking on your in your heart any longer. Prophet says, I know. Then you say, I know what to do. I don't need your advice. I don't want you to read me anything or these things. I don't need your advice. Who are you? &gt;&gt; God help us, Lord. But the bride will have the character of Christ. &gt;&gt; She'll be willing to be corrected. &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to learn more. I want to hear more. I come to the house of the Lord to be corrected. Lord, change my mind. Remove the pride. Remove the arrogance. Lord, I desire to be corrected. I desire to be to to be to be humble and I want to be humble. The prophet says in the statue of perfect man says a lot of us going to fall off before we even get started on temperance. He says, "Then we wonder why God is not in his church doing miracles and things that they used to do." You wonder why we don't have those things. Maybe it's because we lack temperance. We don't want to be corrected. But the church is the house of correction. The church is the correction. We love the people. The prophet says, "I love the people, but sometimes I have to hurt them. I have to hurt their feelings because I have to tell the truth." Amen. As you come to church, you you you you come to the church to be corrected. Amen. Sometimes every service different that service where we have to lift up and we we like to be encouraged. But there are some services you come, oh Lord. Oh, I wish I wish I just trimmed this service because it looks like he was just pointing at me. But we won the house of correction. And let me tell you sometimes all correction don't come from the pulpit but it's a house of correction. We have sometimes to say for we have sometimes to rub each other. Someone has to tell you know the sisters you know I think that that's not correct the way you dressed. someone from the church, not the pastor, not the deacon, someone from the I think that what it will be transparent. It's showing the underwrites. Not I don't think I don't think it's correct, &gt;&gt; you know. &gt;&gt; Don't be frustrated and say who she does. She think she is the mind her business. I come to church. Is there a church? That's not correct. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a house of correction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you can stay in your home and you're independent and everybody. You come to church to be corrected. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And not not every correction come from the church. That is important because he says the B otherwise Jesus Christ would have not said if you see your brother transparency you have to go and talk to him. &gt;&gt; Why the why Jesus didn't say only the pastor has to talk to him. Means someone from the church can talk to that person. Amen. &gt;&gt; I share that this with the brothers the meeting there. Prophet says disagreement is not a reason to separate. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; You don't want to get like Oswald. If I can't disagree with you and things and then shake his hand, still have the same feelings towards him, then there is something wrong with you. If I can't disagree with a man bitterly, the prophet says bitterly means his opinion is different from your opinion. So he comes and say, "No, this is I think what you're doing is wrong." No, no, what I'm doing is right. And someone has his opinion, his opinion and you disagree completely completely disagree and you know this what this this this way is this what the way is we can be in the same church and different opinions and it's fine &gt;&gt; sometime we want to see want everybody to see that the way I see it the way I see that the way it has to be the way let's take an example the way song leading is being done that's the way has to be because I as I was grown up that that has to be someone says no it has not to be I will grow up this way different opinions but you still come the same church &gt;&gt; and if he li this way it's this way he li this way this way oh no the preacher that like like that preacher a preacher has to be here oh I like a preacher who's just quiet he's just reading his note and everything it's okay to have different opinions it's okay That's a mature church. Amen. That the church God wants. It's not a mold up just everything think different. No, we can have different opinions agree bitterally but still have the same feeling. I still love you. Still stand for you. I still work for you. Amen. That's what we desire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he's still my brother. I'm still I'm trying to help him. But I'll never help him. Oh no, I skipped something. Still think as much of him as Christ would. Then there is something with my spirit if I haven't the spirit of Christ. All right, brother. Let's come together to reason you and I. We'll take it to ourself. We'll go over it in this room to ourself. We'll reason it out. And he just cuts me to pieces and I have to say things back to him. If in my heart I can't feel the same about it that he's still my brother and I'm trying to help him, then I will never help him. There's no way for me to help him. If I don't love him, what's the use of going over there anyhow? Tell him the first place. The first place first, brother. I don't love you. Let me get that out of my heart right here before we go in there because I can't help you until I love you. &gt;&gt; I like what the prophet said. Because sometimes we want to correct but we don't love the person. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You just want to show that you are right. &gt;&gt; You want to show that you know &gt;&gt; that a bad motives. &gt;&gt; That's right. you you know Jesus says you know he say the father doesn't want that person to perish to be lost so you have a burden you love that person that's why you carry you pray about you I want to go with the right attitude and say it the proper way &gt;&gt; I understand sometimes you don't feel comfortable talking to others it happen sometimes you'll feel like know I don't feel like I can talk to that person but I feel like that I think can be okay you know some um it's a mother you don't feel like you can correct correct the mother and I think can take maybe to talk to to to the other person and then a nice way the other person go and say you know we have heard like this is it correct and I think I understand that it can happen I think it can happen for instance um I think it can happen But we have the have the right attitude. 1 Timothy 5:12 says, "Rebuke not an elder, but in treat him as a father, the younger man as a brethren, the elder woman as mothers, the younger sisters with all purity. You can't just go because you know it's right. Just go go to an elder and then rebuke him the way you want." No, &gt;&gt; you can't rebuke an elder the way you want. There is a certain approach that elders in the church we have to respect them. We pray for them on Wednesday. You can't just go and take brother Daniel and just rebuke him any no you there is a certain approach you respect and if you don't feel comfortable and thank God example for us but Daniel example for we love you appreciate you brother Daniel brother Dan brother brother Zeke sister Anita Matendo and all the mothers you don't just go and approach them whatever you want it's an approach together respect respectfully Amen. And even to the younger one maybe we have made a mistakes we have just cons because younger one you can talk whatever you want to them. No there is a certain approach also a lot of respect. Consider them as your brothers certain respect that you have to approach them. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible is very strict on that. The way to approach in Galatians 6:1 says, "Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, he which are a spiritual restore such as one in the spirit of meekness, consider thyself, lest thy also be that lest thy also be tempted." So in other words, you don't go and crush him and shame him. The goal of correction is healing and restoration. It's not judgment. You go in a spirit of meekness and then gently humbly aware of your own weaknesses. Maybe you don't have the same weakness as the other one has a weakness. So you consider thou yourself that yourself being a weak also. So you go and correct him in a gentle way, in a nice way. Amen. Second Timothy 2:24 says, "The servant of God must not strive but be gentle unto all men and have to teach patient in meekness in in meekness in striking those that oppose themselves. If God venture will give them repentance to the acknowledgment of the truth. Ephesians 4:2 says, "With all loneliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another." So all this you rebuke with humility, with with simplicity, not a show off, but you you are very humble, simple, and put in a nice way. Maybe we have failed on that. Maybe we we we we put the people away because we have it too harsh and it is the word of God but we approaching in a very harsh way and people get hurt and oh but that's not the right approach and then we then we lose everything. &gt;&gt; So but I I was quoting the word of God to him and yeah it's the word of God but which approach did you take? Was it with loneliness with meekness with gentleness? Was it was it to help him? He's already down. Why you going to crush him again? Help him to stand up a little bit. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm still on the same paragraph, but that's good. Is it good? &gt;&gt; Prophet says question answers number. Brother Banam, some some gets on me or steps on my toes. This might be a good one. Prophet says steps on my toes as the old saying is my temper rises. How can I overcome this thing? I know the Lord will have to do it but what can I do in my heart? I don't want this thing. Prophet says sweeten your temper with prayer. &gt;&gt; Then make up your mind struggling with temper. You know when someone goes when I feel that in me I can't control it. The Holy Spirit has to control your emotions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit has to control your whole being. It has to be the Holy Spirit. It's not even the way brother will say that later on. He's not you know you know when I was not a Christian that person the way he approached me I would have shown him what kind of person I am the prophet himself will say no it has to be sweetness Lord I don't want that in me anymore but I forgive you amen and make up your mind make up your mind means yourself you don't want it anymore because sometimes we worship ship our own spirit. You cherish it because you think it helps you in certain cases because when there is an argument when you shout and everything then you think you have solved the problem because you raise your voice and things and oh it it helped me escape that. So you are cherishing it. It's just on the corner there. When everything is fine you behave very good. When something's wrong then you go and pick it up and helps you. No you are worshiping that spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Put it aside. Put it aside. You have to make up your mind. I don't want it anymore. I don't want it anymore. God help me in prayer. God help me. And God is going to help you. &gt;&gt; It's a long quote here. Let me read it. But just put it. I don't guess there is too many people in this building ever had any more temper than I did to begin with. I had a mouth mashed all the time. I've taken lot of my meals out of a straw. My mother as you know was a half Indian. My my my father was an Irish man. A Kentucky Irish Irish man. &gt;&gt; Irish &gt;&gt; Irish man. A Kentucky Irish adat. So both of them had enough temper to fight a baso. It means according to his nature. Brother Banam was was was inclined to be someone who has a high temper and he did had high temper. Anything small things and he will fight. He was able he was he was thinking to kill people because he was just full full of anger and I'm going to kill them. But listen to the story how it goes on. The Holy Spirit came and change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit came and change &gt;&gt; your old nature. The Holy Spirit can change that old nature and make it a new nature. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't just take excuses and worship that that that old nature. This is my nature. This is my parent. This is how I used to be. this hour was raised. The Holy Spirit has the power to change your nature if you heal yourself to the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Says, "I thought I can never be a Christian, but when the Holy Spirit came into my life, it's done. I had a woman one time I went to have a cut to cut the lights off." No, it was an electrician working that day. I had I had hair on top of my head. And she said, "You little kinkyheaded idiotic." I told her, I said, "The woman, you ought not to curse like that. Don't you fear God?" She said, "You little kinkyheaded idiotic. If I wanted somebody to talk to me about things like that, I wouldn't get a half wheat like you." So, whoa. Then she called me a blanket a blankety a blankety name. Oh my. If that being a he or father, I'll always say a man that to strike a woman wasn't enough. Wasn't man enough to strike a man. But I might have broken that that time calling my mother a bad name like that. But you know what? It never even phased me. &gt;&gt; I said I will pray for you. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise be to God. That's the character of Christ. That the temperance of Christ it even never faced him just oh just a small thing. Why? Because he was filled with the Holy Ghost. He was drunk with the Holy Ghost. Amen. Amen. Says my mother a bad name like you know I said I will pray for you. Never bothered knowing that knowing right then something had happened to me. Yes sir. Oh my. That's the same thing. You know the maniac when he came to the prophet the prophet didn't hate him. He feel so very sorry for him. Why? Because he was full of love. If you have love inside of you, no one can hurt you and you can't hurt no one. If you let the Holy Spirit be in the control tower. The Holy Spirit has to be in the control tower. The problem we don't have the spirit controlling us. We want the Holy Spirit to control our emotions, our temper, our tongue, our everything. We have to yield it to the God so that he can control us. Amen. And he want to control us. Amen. The prophet says you want him as a savior but you what about being your lord that will control you. Control your emotions, control your thinking, control your every fiber of you that you could say like the man years ago who let who let him in. For me I lead to live is Christ and to die is again. Let him is let him in the way to be ruler and lord over you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, a person without temperance is vulnerable. A person with temperance is stable, disciplined, spiritually strong. &gt;&gt; God can't build on someone who is a can't have self-control. He can't put on top of that because you are not you are vulnerable. You are not constant. You are not reliable. Once again, statue of a perfect man. When they say, "If thou be the son of God, turn these stones into bread. If he could have done it and show it, he was God." But he had temperance. When they called him Bezobel, be said, "I'll forgive you for it." That's right. They pulled handful of beard out of his face and spit in his face, he said, "Come down." They said, "Come down of the cross." He said, "Father, forgive them. They don't even know what they are doing." Oh, praise be to God. where the prophet had failed, where the saint of old testament had failed, but Jesus Christ succeeded. Jesus Christ prevailed because he was God in the flesh. Amen. Is God in the flesh, but the same spirit that was in Jesus Christ, the same spirit is now in the body of Christ. We should have we should pray to have give God to give us the godly temperance, the Holy Spirit temperance. Amen. So when you got that right kind of temperance like he had, it vulcanize. If you haven't just made halfway sus sed up belief of temperance or I ought to slap him down but maybe I better not because they might put my name in the paper about it. That's what I saying. So there is something that is preventing you. I would have slapped you but I'm a message believer so I leave you. You know I would have I could have said something bad but you know I hold it off. Next time you try it again, you'll see it's still still not there yet. Amen. Something is preventing you. But you know, you know the the the Muslims and everything what they doing they're putting the law from the outside preventing things from the outside. You know, we use one more time we use a we experience from the church where I was was a teacher. There was a sister who came and she was just havoc and everything. She was behave misbehaving. We tried to calm her down. No sister don't do that and no she was just misbehaving and everything and she was saying things and saying to pastor and everything we tried and we tried to help and we see that the evil spirit we tried them and everything but she was just misbehaving. Then the pastor's wife says, "You know what? Since you have done what we have done now, let's call the police. Let's call the police." Brother, you can't believe it. The sister became nice. So you feel more the police than the advices they giving you to the church because you know the consequences, right, of the police. Sometimes we be we we are very nice at work. We are very nice with people from the outside but we are not nice with the people from the inside the church because there is no external rule. There's no punishment from the outside. You feel like you can do anything. You can be like you can be respectful because there's no external pressure from the outside but there's no love of God from the inside. And &gt;&gt; amen. says, "But maybe I better because they might put my name in the paper about it." That isn't the kind of temperance he's talking about. Don't try to add that. It won't work. But when you can really with the sweetness from your heart, forgive every man. Hold your peace. Let it be gone. See, then it will vulcanize. Valkcanize the word to say then it will be together. me like it would be together to be like a a rubber when you valkconize under the heat then becomes together you can't separate them again that the Holy Spirit when it's the Holy Spirit producing that then then it's a natural from the inside supernatural from the inside then you can add that to your faith amen the Holy Spirit temperance then is not me say that two kinds of temperances the two kinds of temperance one thing is a prohibition mean something from the law from the outside that that not the kind of temperance you know I'm that God is talking about that's ungodly uncontrollable temper you got the things at your side and sus and fast those things because of prohibition that prevent you from doing those things but when there is no constraint from the outside let it come from the inside &gt;&gt; that you can't do it anymore amen &gt;&gt; be nice to your husband be nice to your wife be nice to your children be nice to one another is your wife worthy of the gospel the prophet says when this takes place they think you'll will do. You'll find that the spirit has come in from the new birth. You will believe and do everything that God says in his word is for you to do. Everything that the Bible quotes for you to do, you'll punctuate it with an amen. You'll not stop day or night until you receive it. That's right. That's right. In all time, you'll certainly you'll certainly above everything bear the fruit of the spirit. You say, "Will I speak with tongues?" You might do that. You might not. Will I shout? You might do that. You might not. But there is one thing sure you will do. You will bear the fruit of the spirit. The fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, faith, longsuffering, meekness, gentleness, patience. Your temper will not be, oh, just remember when you got that that poison the Holy Spirit away from you. When you get to a place that you want to fast with everybody you come along to, there is something wrong. When we get to a place where a minister will read from the Bible that's wrong to do certain things and just remember there's no and then you and you'll and then finish that sentence then just remember there's no Christianity there at all that now by their fruit you shall know them that what Jesus said if it's the word God said so that spirit in you will cope with that word and every time because genuine holy spirit will cope with the word of God because the word is life and spirit. Jesus said, "My words are life." I'll be closing soon. If you've got eternal life and is the word, how can the word deny the word? What kind of a person would you make God? There's one thing to know if you're a Christian when you can fully agree upon every word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You find yourself in love with your enemies. Somebody say, "Well, is is nothing but the holy roller?" Means something bad. It's just something who's pretending. You start you start to get, oh, be careful. Be careful. When you really find yourself that you love him, regardless of what they do, you still love them. When you when you begin to find your patience get from about that long till you just don't have no hand. Anybody just keep saying things about you, well, I don't care what you say. Don't get stirred up. If you get stirred up, you better go pray first before you talk to them again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you get stirred up, don't try to react on when you are on when you are stirred up. No, no, it's going to bring bad result. Is is is worse is is actually worse than than than when you are drunk because you you actually lost your mind. Amen. So, no, don't do that. Don't get fast. Don't like to get in fast. If you like to see somebody raised in church, you know what I'll tell you. So, so did and so so say brother, shame on you. If you say, "Oh, that's so listen to that scandal. Watch out. The Holy Spirit is not a sessful." No, no. The heart is occupied by the Holy Spirit is full of holiness, purity, think no evil, doeth no evil, believe all things endureth all all things longsuffering. Don't fast &gt;&gt; when the family get in a fast. Don't fast with them. It's the prophet speaking. Your mother said, "I you didn't have God up here and that old church anymore." Well, you think about now you letting your hair grow out. You look like some old grandma. Don't fast with her. Say, "Okay, mother. It's all right. I love you just the same. I'll be praying for you as long as I live." &gt;&gt; Don't fast. Temper breeds temper. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; First thing you know, you grieve the Holy Spirit away from you. You'll be fasting back. Then the Holy Spirit take its flight. Temper breeds temper. &gt;&gt; Love breeds love. &gt;&gt; That's what I want you to keep in your life. Love breeds love. &gt;&gt; If you love one day, it will produce love again. &gt;&gt; Be full of love. Jesus said this will all men know if you're my disciple my disciples when you love one another that the fruit of the holy spirit did you know that you are a little creator yourself you know that certainly you seen people that you love to be around you know you know why the just loving type of person have you seen that just as kind you like be around they create that atmosphere by the the life that they live they the the way they talk their conversation you are seeing that those every time you shan them all time they want to talk about some something evil, talk about somebody. Oh my, there they come. They're going to criticize somebody there. Here's here now. He's going to talk about this man. All they're going to do is tell dirty jokes or something about women, something like that. You just hate to get around them. They create seemingly pretty nice people, but they create the atmosphere. The prophet talks about the the three monkeys. is a brother or sister ready to put that. So the three monkeys the first one to the left there doesn't want to see bad things. Says that how we should be sometimes we don't want to see bad things negative things and we don't want even to look at bad things because it create an atmosphere. Whatever you look, whatever you like to enjoy that the bad things, it create an atmosphere about you. &gt;&gt; The things that you watch, the thing that you in life, if there are evil things, it create a wrong atmosphere around them. &gt;&gt; Close your eyes to the bad things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The second one is the hearing. Whatever you are hearing, you know the same principle. Faith comes by hearing and hearing of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know that that unbelief and evil things comes also by hearing. What you are hearing is if the bad things it create an atmosphere about you. The third one is speaking talking what you talk what you speak if you speak evil things and bad things negative things it create an atmosphere around you and the prophet says and continue the message says the things that you think on the things that you do the action the things that you talk about create an atmosphere I went into a man's office here in the city and the man is a trusty or deacon in the fine church and I went in to see that man about some business there is a radio over there and with that rock and roll and twist and every and ever what it was just as hard it could be I guess there was 40 pinups in his office of of nude women and and now you can't tell me how much deacon how much more you let me see what you look at or what you read and the kind of music you listen to the crowds you associate with I'll tell you what kind of spirit is in you &gt;&gt; the things that you watch the things that you hear listen to the things that you talk about it create an atmosphere around you it brings evil spirit around you see you hear a guy say me do so and so and so bunch just remember don't care what he says his words speaks louder his actions speak louder than anything you could say he could testify he's a Christian sure but maybe do anything but just what kind of life he lives tells what he is &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; but we should learn from that those Every monkey is here. I hope it stays with us. &gt;&gt; I don't want to see bad things. I don't want to hear any bad things. I don't want to speak bad things. I want to dedicate my whole being to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ was the example of temperance. When he had the gift, he knowed all things. For him was the fullness of the godhead bodily, the statue of a perfect man. They had seen him perform miracles and telling people that was wrong with them and so forth like that. They put a rag around his head like that around his eyes and hit him on the head with a stick and said, "Prophesy. Tell us we hit you. We believe you." He had temperance. Now if you get like if you got it like that, add it to your faith. If you still blow up and sass and fast and stew and carry on, oh, you doesn't have it. You can't have that because it won't add up. It won't vanize. I mean, it will fall somewhere. Jesus Christ had all the power but didn't use all his power. He accepted for a moment to forfeit for forfeit his right. Sometimes we the problem we're struggling is because we want to be right. Come back to temperance for a moment. We want to be right. You don't want to feel feel wrong. You want to be right and then you fight yourself. You fight your own battles and then your anger take over and you are still a Christian sometimes but say no then then you you don't have the real temperance. You know what sometimes is you you accept to be wrong. You accept to be wrong. So just not accept I'm wrong. Forgive me. Maybe another time you bring it up in a nice way. Then when you react under emotions, you fail. Elisha the prophet was he has a he was a prophet. He saw those kids and insulting him. Oh bold bald-headed man. Why you didn't go with Elijah? And he rushed on under hunger and he cursed those kids and a bear came and destroyed them. The prophet said, "Was it the spirit of Christ?" No, it was not a spirit of Christ. But Jesus Christ when they were pulling his beard just, "Oh God, forgive them." They don't know what they do. That's what we desire to be as Christ. &gt;&gt; And Christ, the character of Christ is going to be in the bride because you are predestinated to be the bride of the end time. will have the character of Christ because we have received the ministry of Christ. We have received the fullness of the Holy Ghost now in the church. The Holy Ghost was in the Jesus. God is the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost was in Jesus Christ. Now the Holy Ghost is in the church to produce the same character. Be like Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many can say God I desire to have &gt;&gt; that Holy Spirit temperance. Help me Lord. Help me Lord to have that. Musicians can come. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Tomorrow I surrender. Just sing the chorus for that. I surrender. I to my Lord. More that I release my faith. The more you take control. The more that I can humble myself, the more you lift me up every day. Lord, I love you more. One more time, the chorus. Oh, the more that I surrender, the light of my Lord, the more that I release my king. Oh, the more you take control, the more that I can humble myself. The more Lift me up every day I am Lord. I love you more. The worst enemy is myself. &gt;&gt; I want to die. There is a lot of Moes in me. A lot of Moes that want to show up. That's where the problem is. But I want to die so that Christ can live. I want to die to my pride, to my arrogance, to my to my be right all the time so that Christ can live inside of me. The more I surrender, help me to surrender, Lord. The more I surrender once again. Oh. Oh. The more that I surrender, the light of my Lord, the more that I release my car. Oh, the more you take control, the more that I can humble myself. Oh, lift me up every day. Lord, I love you more. Change my heart, Lord. Oh, change my heart, oh God. Let's stand together.
