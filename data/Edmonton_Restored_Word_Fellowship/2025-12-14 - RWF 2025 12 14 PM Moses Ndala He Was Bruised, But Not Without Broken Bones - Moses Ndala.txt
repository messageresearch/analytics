Summary of "He Was Bruised, But Without Broken Bones" — Sermon by Brother Moses Ndala, Senior Pastor at Restored Word Fellowship in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

Brother Moses centers this sermon on the suffering of Jesus Christ at Calvary, drawing deeply from Isaiah 53:3–11 to show both the cost and the purpose of redemption.

He emphasizes that Christ was “bruised” for our iniquities, explaining that the Hebrew meaning points to being crushed or oppressed, not merely wounded. God did not take pleasure in suffering itself, but in what that suffering would produce: Salvation, reconciliation, and healing for His people. Linking this to Hebrews 12:2, Brother Moses reminds the congregation that Jesus endured the cross for the joy set before Him, fully aware that His suffering would bring many sons and daughters back to God. Salvation, he stresses, is entirely the work of God’s grace, not human merit.

Moving to the crucifixion narrative in John 19:28–37, Brother Moses highlights a seeming paradox: Christ was severely bruised, yet none of His bones were broken.

This fulfilled Old Testament prophecy concerning the Passover lamb, where no bone was to be broken (Exodus 12:46; Numbers 9:12). He draws on Brother Branham’s teaching from the Hebrews series, explaining how the unbroken bones identified Jesus as the perfect Lamb of God, while His bruising showed the full weight of judgment and suffering laid upon Him. God Himself intervened so Scripture would stand true, demonstrating that nothing can fail or overturn the Word of God.

Brother Moses then describes the depth of Christ’s suffering, not only physically but in spirit and soul. Referencing Luke 22:44, he explains the extreme agony Jesus endured, even to the point of sweating as great drops of blood.

Citing Brother Branham, he explains that Jesus did not ...

Let's just go to the Lord in prayer one more time. Father, we thank you for gathering of the saints of saints of the same precious faith. That's what has united us. Father, thank for the Holy Ghost as we heard this morning that there's you have filled us with your Holy Ghost making us part of one body, one family. Father, we thank you for the grace you have done in our lives to be part of you Lord from the different backgrounds, different places where we were Lord. Some of us even deep Lord in the world but Lord your voice called us and brought us together can be part Lord of the sheephold of Jesus Christ himself. You are great shepherd. Father, this evening we want to put our attention upon you Lord. The service just look of what you have done. The price of Calvary, the price of the blood of Jesus Christ and the benefit that we have of it. Lord, Lord, in this moment as the prayer was done earlier, Lord, we want to humble oursel before you Lord. No one is worthy to come and take this cup and take this breath based on his own merits or the works. Father Lord, we die daily. We make mistakes every day. Father Lord, sometimes Lord God, we we do even do even commit iniquities and the things that we know that we should not do and we still do them, Father. Father, Lord, we pray that you forgive us, Lord, that you be merciful unto us. May you look through us, Father, through the blood of your own son, blood of Jesus Christ. Father, we recognize that we are unworthy, but only the blood of Jesus Christ has made us worthy. Lord, you know the desire in our heart is to please you, to honor you. Our desire, Father, Lord, is just, Lord, to see you being manifested and glorified through our lives. May you bless father this service as we can already feel your presence and the solemnity of it father. We just want to humble oursel before you and give you the glory and the honor. Bless your people father. Let it be a service of blessing. From this place father those who are sick will be healed. Those who are weak will be strong.

We give you the glory and the honor. Bless your people. One more time in Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. Amen. Invite you to go to the word of God. Isaiah 53. Thank you, brother Gian. Thank you, brother. Brother Caleb, brother go at the end. If you can prepare, you know how I like the way you do things just a song after song a little bit. That would be great for 10 minutes, 15 minutes or so. It would be great. Yeah. Isaiah 53. No matter how many times you read this scripture, this scripture is still breaking our heart and as especially when you read it really with revelation what it took and the cost of it. Isaiah 53 verse three. Read it in verse 3 to verse 11. The Bible says, "The Lord Jesus Christ, he is despised and rejected of man, was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, and we hid as it were our faces from him. He was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he had borne our griefs and carried our sorrows. Yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for iniquities. And I'll be talking about being bruised. He was bruised for iniquities. Chastisement of our peace was upon him. And with his stripes, we we are healed. That's our promise and still valid today. So all we like sheep have gone astray. We have turned we have turned everyone to his own way. And the Lord had laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed and he was afflicted. Yet he opened not his mouth. He's brought as a lamb to the slaughter. As a sheep before a sheer is dumb. So he openeth not his mouth. He was taken from prison and from judgment. Who shall declare his generation? For he was cut off out of the hand of the living. For the transgression of my people was he stricken. And he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death. Because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him. One more time. Pleased the Lord to bruise him. And he had put him into grief. When thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, you shall see shall make his soul an offering for sin. He shall see his seed. He shall prolong his days. And the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand. shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied. By his knowledge shall my righteous servants justify many for he shall bear their iniquities. Amen. God bless his word. Can I have a seat? The Bible plainly says that he was bruised. was bruised. And the Hebrew word for bruised means he was the Hebrew word for means was he was crushed. The Bible says the Lord it pleased the Lord to bruise him. Pleased the Lord to bruise him. In other words, it's not that God was happy that he was bruised. He was satisfied and or was taking pleasure in what he was and how he was bruised. But no, but God chose him to be bruised. As we heard the song, Sister Stella this morning, he had a purpose. He was looking into the result of what will come out of it. And that the purpose for it was salvation for you and for me. So the Lord pleased the Lord to bruise him. They had a purpose and what God was doing. God did not delight in suffering itself, but he was delighting in what the suffering of Jesus will produce. Amen. As in Hebrew 12, the Bible says, "Who for the joy that was set before him, he endured the cross." Think he endured the cross because of the joy of the victory that comes with the cross. He was thinking of you, you were thinking of me. That's why we are here commemorating what God has done for us. We could not do ourself. We could not save ourself. We cannot rescue ourel. We could not even ourself being reconciled to God on our own merit. It depending completely on what God has done. The salvation is completely God and God himself. And that's why we are so thankful for what he has done for us. Amen. Thanks to Calvary, we have the removal of our sins. As I said, even our iniquities, he has taken them away. Because of Calvary, we have the reconciliation to our God. We have the fulfillment of the justice and righteousness of God. Not our own righteousness, but he took upon him our iniquities and he made us the very righteousness of God himself. The price is that the price is paid so that we can be free. He paid the price so that we can be free. He became sin so that we might become the very righteousness of God himself. John 19 as we go into the scripture in John 19 it says because this is a time of crucifixion and what happening the Bible says John 19 verse 28 says after this Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled he said I thirst Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar and they filled the sponge with vinegar and put it upon his and put it to his mouth. And when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and now the scripture he knew that the scripture was going to be fulfilled. Says now he bowed his head and he gave up the ghost. gave up the ghost and himself he had to lay down his own life. No one took it from him. Himself had to lay down for you and for me. He gave up his ghost. And the Jews therefore because it was a preparation that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the Sabbath day. For that Sabbath day was an high day besought Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away. Then came the soldiers and break the legs of the first and of the other which was crucified with him. But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was dead already, they break not his legs. But one of the soldiers with his spear pierced his side, and forth came there, and and and fourth weave came there out blood and water. And he that saw it bear record and his record is true. And he knoweth that he said and what he and he knoweth that he s true that he might believe. Is Paul John himself saying that wrote it. I saw it. It was their witness. Said for these things were done that the scripture should be fulfilled. A bone of him shall not be broken. And again another scripture said they shall look on him whom they pier. Amen. I'd like to talk just a little for a moment here. He was bruised but without broken bones. Say was bruised but they didn't break any of his bones. Amen. It looks like a contradiction here. Looks like a contradiction. How would he bruised? How was he crushed? But at the same time, none of his bone were broken. Why this? Why that? The answer is in the scripture. Amen. And the prophet himself says in Hebrews chapter chapter 2 in the series of Hebrews and chapter two he says now there happens to be a Jews there are somebody that understand the old testament prove let me show you I haven't got the old testament with me it says this is the new testament but in the offering of the shoe bread that was laying on the kosha plate in the Jewish sacrifice at the cleansing of the tabernacles ask any Jew on these three pieces of bread the middle piece was broken that was Christ the middle piece was broken. Christ the in between showed that there had to be a breaking somewhere for redemption. And that piece was considered redemption on the kosher bread. And here it is. And tonight when we take the communion, we break the kosher bread for it is the body of Christ. Break show out the suffering. And he was broken at Calvary to be a propitiation for our sins. That through his righteousness we might become through his righteousness we might become his righteousness because became our sins that we might become his righteousness. Brother that's purely grace. Aren't you thankful for God's grace in our life? Said absolutely said there is no way any other way you could justify. How could the Roman just putting my my thought here? How could a Roman soldier pierce him on the side without breaking any bones? The Lord Jesus Christ, he he couldn't break any bones because he had to become he had to be he was already the perfect lamb of God, but he had to fulfill the scripture as being the perfect lamb of God. as a lamp. They were bringing the lamp to to the the bringing the lamp for sacrifice. Exodus 12:14 says, "Neither shall he break a bone of that lamb shall not break the the bone of that lamb." In Numbers 9:12 says, "They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it." So that is a representation of the perfect lamb of God. They could not break any bone of it. Amen. prophecies the atonement. It says the atonement says notice they were they were ready to break the legs of our Lord Jesus Christ. If that harm would have struck that leg and broke it, God would have been found false. But there wasn't enough devils in all dark torment to let that harm strike that precious body. says, "For David 800 years before then said, there will not be one bone broken in his body." God's word had to stand true. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and what did they do then? Then they took a spear and rammed it into his side and blood and water came out to fulfill what the Bible said. They pierced my hand and my side. The word was to be fulfilled. Isn't that wonderful? Amen. That even even though that was just about to break the the legs of our precious of our precious Lord Jesus Christ. God had to intervene. God had to intervene so that the scripture might be fulfilled. Nothing can break the scriptures of God. But at the same time, he was bruised. The fact that none of the bones were broken doesn't reduce the fact that he was bruised. He was crushed. Amen. The Bible used the word crushed. And that crashed in Hebrews means he was oppressed, shattered, oppressed, broken in his spirit and in body, severally afflicted. Amen. Isaiah 53. As we rise, surely he had borne our griefs and carried our sorrows. &gt;&gt; You think that you have sorrows. You think that you have griefs and sad moment. He took that all of them upon himself to understand what we are going through, what you are going, what I'm going through. He bore all our griefs and all our sorrows upon himself, crushed and bruised of all our sorrows and all our griefs. So that when we are going through them, we understand that our savior understands what we are going through and we don't have to worry. B all our griefs and our souls. Look at being a physicians. He describes the agony of our Lord Jesus Christ. In Luke 22 verse 44 it says being in an agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was was as if it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground. A rare in medical terms it says it a rare condition in extreme stress where the capillaries burst and blood mixes with sweat mean it was in a so much deep stress so much deep I'll say trauma just that that that grieves and the sorrow and I came to my own and they rejected me and I'm bearing all this this burden upon me because I want to pay the price. The price for the deliverance of my my bride and all that was upon him crushed bruised for my sorrow for your sorrow. But one will go even deeper and says he died. He died paraphrasing a greater death and he gets money than at the cross because he had to make that decision and and then when he made that decision or not my will but your will Lord &gt;&gt; and there he was already determined because he saw the joy he wants the price is paid so that you and I can be free. Proverbs 18:14 says, "The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmities." If you have infirmities in the body, if your spirit is strong, you can sustain those infirmities. But a wounded spirit who can bear when the spirit is broken, it's hard. Spirit is wounded, it's hard. Amen. But Lord Jesus Christ even though none just trying to put out that that scripture is sorry even though one bone was not broken but he this spirit was bruised crushed even the body was actually crushed the flesh and the muscles and everything. Amen. No human being could suffer like he suffered. No human can have such trauma as he had. He was the creator being humiliated by his own creation. He was mocked before Kas the high priest. He was slapped on the face by telling the truth that you shall see the son of man sitting on the right hand of God. They spat on his face. They pulled off his beard of my Lord Jesus Christ for you and me. And this by his own creation so that you and me can be saved. He was indeed bruised. A man. The Bible says in John 19:13 says, "Pilate therefore took Jesus and scorched him. The soldiers platted platted a crown of stones and put it on his head and they put it on him a purple robe and said, "Hey, king of the Jews and they smought him with their hands." You know, if you the passion of Christ gives a little bit of a glimpse of what will happen, what happened or they discoued him and whipped him. The brother described in terms of the very hard the nails on on those that weeping him crushing his flesh, removing his flesh, the of my Lord Jesus Christ and just weeping him and whipping him and the blood flashing out from all directions for you and me, being bruised, being crushed to bear my pain, to bear my sorrows, to bear my sicknesses. is my afflictions to understand when I'm in prayer. He understand. Amen. And on top of that he was stripped to increase the humiliation as the Roman capital punishment Roman crucifixion of involve the public nakedness to shame the condemned by Lord Jesus Christ completely scripted people mocking him laughing at him so if if you saved others why can't you save yourself oh you say you are King of the Jews, why can't you save yourself? But from that deep sorrow still say, father forgive them. They don't know what they do. What they are doing, they don't know what they are doing. But forgive them. He was thinking of you were thinking of me. Prophet says, I'll skip that one to save time. And it comes to where the soldier comes to pierce his side. The Roman exe executioners were expert executioners. They knew how to make the condemned suffer a lot while dying slowly. They knew how to that's why they put them in the cross and they put the nails on the feet so that you as you are suffering you're like being asphicated because you have to push yourself up to have a little bit of breath and then down and you are forcing yourself but you're dying slowly slowly slowly slowly and that's what my lord was going through and I was saying they knew how to make the condemned suffer a lot while dying but they also knew how to speed it up that's why when he came they realized that the other ones were not dying quick and then they cut their the feet to allow the condemned to feel to not be able to fill up his lungs with hair because they cut the feet. You can't push up yourself anymore. They want to make sure that you don't fake the death. And then they pierced took a spear and then thrust into the side of the Lord Jesus Christ. And out of that heart came out blood and water. It's not prophet says he didn't die because of that of that of of of of the suffering of of how they afflicted him in the flesh. He didn't die because of that but he died out of the grief and and that spear actually re revealed how much suffering he has been going through because it showed after his death the scriptures after he died that the blood and the water was separated. The only condition is of showing that someone went through extreme extreme extreme extreme trauma, extreme stress, extreme crashing in the spirit, in the mind, in the in the body. That's the blood and the water can be separated to show how much suffering our lord went through. Prophet says in so by himself says he died a sinner nailed to cross. Every physical thing showed that he was dead. They beat him. They hung him up there. Well, he bled enough to kill him and he was dead. The heavens declared he was dead. The earth say that he was dead. Everything say that he was there. The Roman soldier rammed the spear threw his heart and there let his blood out. Blood and water which is was separated showed of grief and and he said he was dead. Look if the man was hanging there and blood and water poured out showed that the blood and the water had separated. Prophet says allelujah he was dead and he never died from the sword. He never died from the pierce. He died because of grief. There is nothing in the world will separate blood from water. Ask any science you want to and any doctor tell you only through hard grief and sometimes that people suffer so hard that you know in the grief like head like heart heartaches and and things like that and sometimes cause a heart attack and kills them when the blood and water separate. That what killed the Lord Jesus. He died under the hands of Jehovah. That's right. the full penalty. Justice for God. For God required justice. There is no man could take his life. He said, "I laid it down. No man can take it. I laid it down and I raise it up again." Are you thankful for what it took the Lord Jesus Christ to die on our behalf? But as as as as as that spear separated the blood or show the separation of the blood and the water in the water separation, it says that word of separation separates you from sin. If you are weary, apply the word of the word. If you are sick, apply the word of the word. For it separate us from sickness. It separate us from sin. Separate us from weary. Separate us from every attribute that sin produced. Oh, I love it. For he was washed. For you he has washed us and cleansed us from the washing of the water by the word and separate us unto himself a believing people set aside from the world to believe to the Holy Spirit operating through the inside of the blood cell. I hope you see it. The blood cell bursted at Calvary. That's my thought. The blood cell bursted at Calvary. Life was inside the cell and then it broke the cell. Christ did first. Christ did first bringing himself into the womb of virgin and creating around him a cell, a blood cell that multiplied in many cells and brought forth the son of Christ Jesus. And at Calvary, this blood cell was broken by a sinful Roman spear as it pierced him in the heart. And I'll say before that spear pierced that heart, that heart was already full of grief. Of the grief and bearing our grief and our sorrows, it was already pierced. But now look, let's look at the benefit of of what it brought to us today. What he done for us, what it means for us. Calvary means for us. Says right in the middle of the heart is a little place in human being that isn't an animal. A little place in there. And I think it's a soul of a man. There's not a blood cell touches it or anything. And in there is the human soul. And Christ was speared through there. That's the blood cell was pierced like that. Throw loose the blood cell and set the Holy Spirit at liberty for God to call through there and bring believers through the blood cell back into fellowship with himself again. If you see the purposes of how how we get back to fellowship with God, we have to go to the blood. We have to go to the water. We have to go to the blood. And then we have to have the Holy Spirit. As I was thinking about it, this is just my own thought that the way I know there there's there there's a proper we there is an order have to go you have to water we have to go the blood you have to go to the the life but but look how the Bible does describe it. He gave up his spirit and then 1934 if I'm not mistaken then it says then came out of it the blood and then the water. So for for the sinner, the sinner was down there. God is going the other way around. So he gave up his spirit. He's gave up then the blood and then then the water so that you on the other side you can take take those steps of the water and then the blood and then come to the life. So he had to do the reverse work in order to bring you back to where he is to restore that fellowship. Amen. So through the washing of the water over the word, faith comes by hearing, hearing by the word of God. And we accept the word and believe the word that he was wounded for transgression. What was that separation to do? What did he separate them from? As soon as they received the separation, they were free. What was Christ separated from? What did he separate us from? The Bible said he was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace upon him. And with his stripes we were separated from our diseases. The blood in him and the water was separated. Even the Holy Spirit was separated. Amen. So that us can be separated from our diseases. &gt;&gt; Thank God. &gt;&gt; We can be separated from our diseases. We can be separated from our sins. The prophet says, "Separated from our weary, separated from our iniquity, separated from our sins by the word which was Christ that was made flesh and dwelt among us." Amen. And another part as I'm finishing with this says out of his side mark of the beast as God opened up the side of Adam in the garden and took out the part to make a bride. God opened up the side of Jesus at Calvary and took out the bride out of his side. He suffered so that he can take the bride out of it. you and me today and we are beneficiary of the high price of Calvary and we can rejoice in it. So I want to show you when God gave Adam his bride from his side he said she's flesh of my flesh bone of my bone is that right? When God gave Christ his bride, the spirit gave the flesh, the bride, he was punched, pierced on the side under his heart and water and blood and the spirit came forth that became flesh of his flesh. Born of his bone and we are the flesh and the bones, the bride will be the flesh and bones of Christ. Exactly. That is his bride. That verse uh say that verse of John 19:34 is one of the most theological dense verses in the gospel of John because only John having the anointing of the eagle pointed out to that. No other gospel mentioned it. Only John only the bride can recognize where she comes from. So this is one of the most theologically dense scripture of the gospels because it is linking the history one part of the history where there is the type of the of the lamb that the bones were not broken out of it. Amen. But it also bringing together the prophecy that what the what pro what prophesies in the prophecy that none of these bones should be broken. It has been fulfilled. But out of it also comes the bride. Out of it comes also salvation which is the blood and also the water of separation. One of the precious scriptures that of his heart came out life. Amen. I'll finish with this musician can come. Even the moisture from his body left and the blood run down this the spear and off his feet and trinkled onto the ground. He was so dead. Prophet he was so dead until the moon and the stars said he was dead. The earth said he was dead. He had a nervous frustration. The rocks shook out of the earth and everything everything said he was dead. Even God hid his face because he was dead. But his body was transformed because God said, "I will not leave his soul in hell. Neither will I suffer my holy one to see corruption." One day there was a resurrection as a type of us as well. There will be a resurrection because of what Calvary has done for us. Amen. in the cross. In the cross singing them before I read the scripture, the cross in the cross be my glory forever. Oh Jesus, keep me in the cross. Precious fountain free to healing stream flows from &gt;&gt; in the cross. See the cross. &gt;&gt; In the cross. &gt;&gt; Be my glory. &gt;&gt; Glory. Till my wra so shall find beyond the river in the cross and twing soul love and merciful I think of what he has done for us. &gt;&gt; The cross is the place of our refuge &gt;&gt; and it be around. &gt;&gt; In the cross. &gt;&gt; In the cross. &gt;&gt; In the cross. &gt;&gt; In the cross. Be my glory. &gt;&gt; Glory. In my rapuous soul shall find as we are the &gt;&gt; in the cross. Lamb of God, bring it sing before me. Help me walk from day to day. Oh sh. &gt;&gt; Oh father, do not let me forget the cross. In the cross. &gt;&gt; In the cross. &gt;&gt; In the cross. &gt;&gt; In the cross. &gt;&gt; In my glory. &gt;&gt; Ever. Till &gt;&gt; till my rapur soul shall find. Rest beyond the river near the cross I watch and hope ever till I reach the golden strength. Just beyond the river. &gt;&gt; In the cross. &gt;&gt; In the cross. &gt;&gt; In the cross. &gt;&gt; In the cross. &gt;&gt; In my glory. Glory and ever &gt;&gt; till my rock soul shall fall. Rest me on the river. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus Christ. Father present your to you your bride. Father that you look through the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Father Lord present to you your church &gt;&gt; the one you died for. Father on that day you bore the griefs and the sorrows.

Amen. Want to invite the elders and pastor Z. As I breaking the bread, just want to invite you to read 1 Corinthians 11:23. For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed and took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and take and say take eat that this is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup when he had sapped, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. This do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat the bread and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death till he come." Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body of the body and the blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkketh unworthily eatth and drinkketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chestnuts of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world. Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, tar one for another. Matthew 26:26:30 says, "As they were eating, Jesus took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to the disciples and said, "Take, eat. This is my body." Pastor, would you please pray for the bread? Father, we look to you tonight Jesus. We description Lord of the Lord. But we want to thank you from all of our hearts. We want to thank you Lord God for paying the price for being Lord. You were bruised for you were the Yes. &gt;&gt; Just like it was dirt. We thank you, Lord Jesus, for doing it for us. For my iniquities, for my wrongdoings where I knew how to do better and I didn't do it. Lord, forgive me, oh God. Help us, your people, to be thankful. Help me to be thankful, Lord, to appreciate what you've done for us. for me personally. Lord, I want to thank you, Lord. I was nothing and you picked me up out of the dirt and Lord, you raised me up, Lord Jesus, to shine for your glory. How thankful we are today that we can have that approach to our God, the spirit of God through Jesus Christ our Lord, and be reconciled to you, Lord. What a great work it was, Lord. Like we heard this morning, Lord, we recognize we heard many different words, but Lord, we know the Holy Spirit is God himself &gt;&gt; because you are spirit &gt;&gt; and we must worship you in spirit and in truth. So Lord, help us to get into the spirit. Help us all, Lord. We're so fleshly often times. But Lord Jesus, we want to remember tonight, not only tonight, but every day. We want to thank you, Lord, for helping us where where we where we were weak. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Where we were undone, but Lord, you helped us, Lord, like we've broken this bread. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We raise it, Lord, up to heaven. We pray that you would bless it as we eat this bread. May we remember Yes. &gt;&gt; How you suffered, how you were broken beyond &gt;&gt; measure. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh God, I've seen some pictures. It's beyond measure. Lord, it's unescribable. Our hearts are breaking, Lord. Our emotions are high. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; Lord. What you have done for us, Lord. We thank you. We thank you. We thank you.
