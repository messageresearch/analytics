Summary of "The Faith of Mary" — Sermon by Brother Moses Ndala, senior pastor at RWF in Edmonton, Alberta.

In this sermon, Brother Moses begins by drawing the congregation into a moment of worship and reflection, reminding them of God’s mercy, His daily help, and His faithful love in every trial. He encourages believers to recognize themselves as the beloved Bride of Jesus Christ, chosen and protected by God before the foundation of the world (Ephesians 1:4). Turning to John 16:20–28, he explains that though believers may experience seasons of sorrow, Jesus promises that their sorrow will be turned into joy, just as a mother forgets her pain once her child is born. This theme of spiritual birth leads directly into the example of Mary in Luke 1:28–38, where she receives God’s promise with humble faith.

Brother Moses highlights how Brother Branham often used Mary as a type of the true end-time Bride—one who receives the Word and carries it to fulfillment. He cites Branham’s teaching that the Bride is addressed in the Seven Church Ages as a “love letter” written specially for her, not for denominations but for those who can receive the revealed Word (Church Age Book; “Pergamean Church Age”).

 He emphasizes that the Bride, like Mary, is highly favored, watched over, and predestinated to fulfill God’s promise in her season. Just as the angel overshadowed Mary, the Holy Ghost overshadows believers when they gather under the Word, causing spiritual life to move within them.

Throughout the message, Brother Moses stresses the importance of accepting the Word without reasoning, exactly as Mary did. Mary could not explain how the virgin birth would happen, yet she believed, saying, “Be it unto me according to Thy Word” (Luke 1:38). Brother Branham taught that this simple faith is what God honors: “Give us more Marys who can take Go...

Heavenly Father, we come before your presence. We are empty-handed, Lord. Our hearts are yearning for you. We're looking for a blessing from you, a word spoken, an encouragement given, something to lift us up, Lord, into those beautiful heavenlies. Lord, we've had a week which has challenged us, Lord, many of us. And we've had victory also, Lord. And you've provided all of our needs. We give you thanks and praise. Thank you for bringing us all together here that we could worship you in spirit and in truth. We ask Lord that you speak to each individual heart this morning. May the song service Lord bring you nearer and may we draw near. May we be lifted up into you. May we be found in Christ today Lord. May the preaching of the word and the accepting and embracing of your lovely lively presence and your your holiness, Lord, may it cover us, Lord. We're reminded that your blood your blood has paid the price, Lord. That all our sins are cast into sea of your forgetfulness.

Uh so recently I was uh subbing in the schools and um they said, "Hey, you you can stay. They somebody's going on medical leave and so we need somebody to fill in." So I thought about it and I said, "Siz it up. Can I do this?" Yes, I know the kids from last year. This is a grade nine class and They are the ones who are slipping through the cracks. Those who not so well but the system pushes them through. So we're dealing with literacy issues and by teaching them math which is a core subject and English which is also a core subject and they're working at a certain level various as they always spread across this continuum. But uh I took on the challenge. I said yes because I I asked the Lord. He said do it. I'm with you. Fear not. I won't leave you. And so, he hasn't left me. He's been very faithful to me as I as I've now worked in a bit over a week with these students. And I've I've got about 80 students alto together and teaching them life skills and careers as well as I'm also a foods teacher. So, I get to cook which is kind of cool. But the math and and uh and the English it's coming along really nicely. Got great response. It's the Lord doing it every step of the way. Huge challenge with uh when we've got a whole class full of students who are not really at the level they should be. But the Lord is faithful. He he will not leave us destitute. He will always provide a way where there is no way. And so this job will continue at least till Christmas. And it's not sure. It may be longer. It may even be to the end of the year. But uh I don't know. It's Thank you, Sister Wendy, for taking Wednesdays. Gives me a chance to have something marked for Thursday so I can be in in to do my job properly. But God bless you.

Few announcement the wonderful youth meeting on Friday and father gosh gave an exhortation prayer prayer prayer and then we had a small session of the young people and praying for the needs and personal needs. So just just a good atmosphere and how we can carry one another's burden just praying for another. It was it was just good that the simplicity of the children and just praying and it was just nice atmosphere and I pray that we continue having the the youth meeting and then and if you need transportation just let us know. We are willing to to transport and move you from one place to the other just to attend those meetings. Um, we have communion on the 14th of December. Just keep that in prayer 14th of December. We try to do that every three months. So, we can keep that on for the for the December the 14th. And next weekend, next weekend, we'll have a special visitor from brother Toby referred him to him to me coming from Kenya. I think be a blessing and also want to say thank you for the ministers were there when uh when I was not there and just replaced and help brother thank you also brother Victor [snorts] is in is in brother Victor and just thank you for for taking the Wednesdays and the other ministers ministers and thank you for the officers of the church and the presence of each and everyone Without you there's no church. So appreciate the presence. Brother Bham says you support the church by your presence as well and offering ties but the presence is important because without you there is no there's no church. Um so we appreciate that you're coming. Um I I failed to put um to start by by by the report a little bit but just greetings from the brothers and ministers and over there greeting the church and pastor Zeke for sure and sister Anita and um they've done a great work over there through all these years. Something telling I've learned a lot over there but one of the things that I've learned is appreciate Pastor Z more and Steve Moore for the work that has been done that was not visible the simplicity but a lot has been done over there and I I tease brother Steve like the CL family looks like eighth messenger in India [laughter] doesn't like that when I say that he doesn't like it but tease him a bit hard but we became friends so I could could almost say that but don't use that on him you might he might not smile at you. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; But because he said, "Brother, if you continue, I'll come out of the ministry." [laughter] So he was threatening me. But I was I was allowed after those two weeks of friendship to Cortis. It's just a tremendous work and respect them a lot. Respect him pastor pastor Zeke a lot and the work has been done, the patience through these years. And uh it's people coming from from denominations and you you bury them and help them and they found one key brother there. Maybe at the end I might give that more report. Um what do you think? Can I say can I can I just move on? I'm feeling a little bit sorry for pastor pastor for brother Bla who has to leave for work. I wanted to go in the work and the word of God. I'm feeling so that you don't come just to church for for song service and then you go back. I'm feeling for you. So that's why I want to go to the word of God. right away so that you get something before you go to work. Um but so but but we had a good time so I'll put that at the end so that we allow him to have to to have a little word of God. Um I lost my mind of thought. So brother Vam a precious man and we'll see that at the end is the one working printing the word of God and just tremendous man of God and and God has been using him the actually God's grace that Pastor Zeke found him because at the place where he can print at low price $2 for [snorts] for printing and almost delivering or including two two Canadian dollars so it's just just a miracle you can find that place like that and he has two boys all of them are two ministers and they're helping me almost fulltime for that so it's just just amazing and 400 churches benefiting from that work 400 churches Think about it and just been a blessing or that and your your your participation is helping someone is helping churches there. Most of them don't speak English and even ministers don't speak English. Few people speak English. So the translation is really really needed. And we see on testimony one of them because they don't have food. [snorts] I have no food. They have to go in Christian libraries and read one book there, get a little bit of thought and then they can preach to the people of thought because they don't have the message. So what we are doing is really helping them. So God bless you richly and then let's go to the word of God and we'll put the testimony at the end. Keep your mind stayed on me as we go to the word of God. Stay on me. Stay on me. Faithfully. And I win perfect peace sweet release if you just keep your mind stay on me. One more time. In your [music] mind, stay on me. Stay on me. Faithfully. And I view your perfect peace, sweet, if you just keep your mind stay [music] on me as we go to the word of God. Just keep your mind on him for a moment. for what the Lord is [music] to you. How what he has done in your life, has been faithful, how he has helped you, how he has saved you, how he has healed you, has provided your needs and has been on your side. When you are weak, he's strong. Just think about the marvelous grace of God in your life and his mercy, forgiveness of our sins. Oh father, Lord, we thank you. We thank you, Father. We love you.

He's known in India [laughter] because he was there said don't forget to greet brother Andrew and I would like you to be over there again. So I'd like to go to John 16 2028. John 16:208. Verily of verily I say unto you that you shall weep and lament and but the world shall rejoice and shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. A woman when she is in travail as sorrow because her horror is come but as soon as she's delivered of the child she rememberth no more the anguish for joy that the man is born in the to the world. And ye now therefore have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you. &gt;&gt; And in that day we shall ask me, you shall ask me nothing. Verily I say, I say unto you, whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name, he will give it to you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Either though have you asked nothing in my name, ask and you shall [snorts] receive &gt;&gt; that your joy may be full. &gt;&gt; These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs, but the time cometh when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall show you plainly of the Father. that day you shall ask in my name. And I say unto you, I say not unto you that I will pray the father for you. For the father himself loveth you because he have loved me and have believed that I came out from God. I come for from the father and I come into the world again. I leave the world and go to the father. May God bless his word and have a seat. Brother Banam used this scripture I believe and to preach on birth pains. Amen. And then go again Luke 128:34 38. And the angel came into her. I thought that I shared in India there like as well to share it here few moment. And the angel came unto her. Luke 1 verse 28. And the angel came in unto her and said, "Hail, thou art highly favored. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women." And verse 34, "Then said Mary unto the angel, how shall this be, seeing I know not a man?" And the angel answered and said unto her, the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee. Therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God. And behold, thy cousin Elizabeth, she had also conceived a son in her own age, an old age, and this is the sixth month with her, and was called barren. For with God nothing shall be impossible. And Mary said, "Behold the handmade of the Lord. Be it unto me according to thy word." &gt;&gt; And the angel departed from her. Amen. &gt;&gt; I share the thought there over there and I just want to speak about Mary's faith and brother Balam. will take the scripture of oh talking about Mary will go in different ways and we know that he will talk sometimes about Mary being just the incubator and and then the seed there is the real one so then put on the type with the the nominations and we are we are the seed proper seed sometimes as you speak the message of Mary's faith the faith of Mary and then and now he's talking to Mary as as a believer man as a true believer And and I want to take that that thought the faith of Mary and then go to that as the word was in Mary so the word is also in us. But when I'm speaking in a message uh peramum church age he took they take that that that is talking about what god gave him pick up the pen and write pick up the pen and write. Pick up the pen was an inspiration that the angel told the prophet or they had inspiration the prophet had an inspiration to write down. It's coming directly from God. For me, I consider it as a as a love letter. &gt;&gt; Excuse me, my voice. My voice is still not completely recovered, but I hope it's fine. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, um, let me just drink a little bit here. Pick up a pan. You say that that letter for the for the bride. So, it's a love letter for the bride. It's like God speaking to you directly. God speaking to me. So he's writing that specially for the bride. Amen. It's not a letter that is being addressed to the to churches to denominations. It's a letter completely for the bride as he's speaking to you. It should be it should be something precious to you. For me, you know, remember when we in courtship before in courtship and all lots of time those were in the times where they didn't have they didn't have to to write in WhatsApp and Facebook and things they have to send the letter they send you a letter and then the letter takes one month and comes to you and then you and you really love when you receive that letter you keep that letter you cherish that letter right papa mat your time you take that letter you read it and you look at it you check it and you go ahead and some what does she mean by that and oh what does he mean by that and you really cherish that time amen it's not you might read one time but you go again you read it again you go again you read it again because you are in love the prophet says the Bible is a is is a love letter if you read the Bible you need to be in love with the author of the word of God says you read the Bible it's a love letter it's not a punishment it's not a dos and don't it's a love an expression of God to you. It's God telling YOU THAT HE LOVES YOU. Like he Jesus Christ is saying the father loves you. You have to be sure of that love towards you. Amen. Otherwise you you might take it as a law. No, it's not a law. It's a love letter. Amen. How many believe that it's a love letter? &gt;&gt; So God is speaking to you and and the Bible is God speaking to you and the prophet takes it and is talking to the bride. say from a little group of the true seed of the word, God will present Christ with a beloved bride. So the prophet said that you are the BELOVED BRIDE. GOD LOVES YOU. GOD TAKES CARE of you. God is watching over you. God is thinking of you. If there is nothing else that is more important than YOU IN GOD'S EYES, GOD LOVES YOU. AMEN. Whatever the enemy is trying to put, no matter what you are going through, no matter the trials, there is love that is predominating over your life. WHY DOES HE LOVE YOU? BECAUSE HE CHOSE YOU BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. THE WHOLE WORLD MIGHT DIE, BUT YOU CAN NEVER DIE. BECAUSE HE'S WATCHING OVER YOU. YOU ARE SO PRECIOUS IN GOD'S EYES. YOU ARE PART OF GOD. AMEN. YOU ARE THE BELOVED BRIDE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; MY WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT FOR ME THAT is just amazing to KNOW THAT GOD LOVES ME. I CAN NEVER DIE AS GOD CAN NEVER DIE. AMEN. I'M PART OF GOD. I'M SO CHERISHED BY GOD. &gt;&gt; IN ALL DESPITE BUT DESPITE WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH, GOD IS LOVE. GOD'S LOVE IS CONSTANTLY UPON YOU. HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT GOD LOVES YOU? BECAUSE HE CHOSE ME BEFORE THE foundation of the world. Because he put my name in THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE. IT CAN NEVER BE ERASED. LIKE WE HEARD THE OTHER TIME FROM ETERNITY TO GO BACK TO ETERNITY. WE ARE IN THE TIME THE TIME HERE. NO MATTER WHAT CAN HAPPEN, NO MATTER YOUR MISTAKES, NO MATTER YOUR DOWN, THERE IS AN UNCONDITIONAL COVENANT HERE BECAUSE GOD LOVES YOU. &gt;&gt; HE CALLED YOU BELOVED BRIDE. &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; go in India there. So they have their gods and then different gods. Oh, God is just do this, punishment, do this, do this. BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A GOD WHO CALLS YOU BELOVED &gt;&gt; MEAN HE LOVES YOU. HE WANT RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU. HE WANT A CONNECTION WITH YOU. HE DIED FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU ACTUALLY THE PROPHET ONLY PROPHET CAN SAY THAT YOU ARE ACTUALLY MORE VALUABLE IN GOD'S EYES THAN HIS OWN BLOOD. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY HE COULD GIVE HIS OWN HIS OWN BLOOD. YOU LOOK AT OWN LIFE, OWN BLOOD. SO KNOW I I CAN GIVE THAT FOR HER BECAUSE I LOVE HER SO MUCH. &gt;&gt; Beloved bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Say she's a virgin of his word. She's virgin of his word. She's a virgin because she knows no man made creeds or dogmas. Oh, you might have known, you might have gone through delination and everything. BUT ONCE YOU RECEIVE THE WORD OF GOD, THE WORD OF GOD IS CLEANSING YOU, IS WASHING YOU, IS MAKING YOU PURE. AMEN. IS REMOVING ANYTHING OF THE WORLD AND MAKES YOU VIRGIN IN GOD'S EYES. AND HE DECLARES YOU JUSTIFIED AS IF YOU HAVE NEVER DONE IT TO BEGIN WITH BECAUSE HE LOVES YOU. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE CARES FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; OTHERWISE, EXPLAIN THAT. YOU KNOW, UH, excuse me for saying that, but you have to understand WHAT I'M SAYING. GOD LOVES YOU MORE THAN HE LOVED THE PROPHET. GOD CARES MORE FOR YOU THAN HE CARED FOR THE PROPHET. THAT'S WHY HE PUNISHED THE PROPHET BECAUSE YOU ARE SO PRECIOUS. The prophet's part of the bride, too. So, I'm saying you be careful what I'm saying. The prophet IS PART OF THE BRIDE. BUT TO KNOW IN THAT OFFICE, HE HAS TO BE FAITHFUL BECAUSE GOD WAS WATCHING OVER YOU. He wanted you TO BE SAVED. SHE CANNOT BE SAVED. IF SHE CANNOT RECEIVE THE CREEDS AND DOGMA OF DENOMINATIONS. SO YOU AS A PROPHET AS I'M SENDING TO YOU, YOU MAKE SURE THAT YOU STAY FAITHFUL BECAUSE I CARE FOR HER. I LOVE HER AND I WANT HER TO BE SAVED AND SHE MUST BE SAVED. MY WORD CAN NEVER BE COMPROMISED, CAN NEVER BE DEFEATED. MY PURPOSE IS THAT BRIDE &gt;&gt; MY FROM ALL ETERNITY [screaming] GOD IS WANTING JUST TO BE EXPRESSED THROUGH YOU THROUGH ME. ALL THE ALL REDEMPTION STORIES IS ABOUT HIM AND YOU PERSONALLY YOU. AMEN. NOT SOMEONE ELSE. YOU [screaming] REALLY YOU. YES. YOU &gt;&gt; BELOVED BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; MARY WAS THERE. She was not thinking that she was important in GOD'S EYES. BUT GOD was watching over her. AS SHE WAS A LITTLE BABY, GOD was watching over her. I WOULD SAY EVEN BEFORE SHE WAS BORN, THROUGH ALL THE GENERATIONS, THROUGH ALL THE THINGS SHE WENT THROUGH HER LIFE OR THROUGH HER PARENTS, GRANDPARENTS AND EVERYTHING, GOD WAS WATCHING OVER THAT SEED, &gt;&gt; OVER THAT SEED, OVER THAT SEED. UNTIL HE GET TO MARY. MARY HAD TO BE THE FULFILLMENT OF THE WORD OF GOD FOR THAT SEASON. &gt;&gt; NO OTHER SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE, BUT GOD WATCH OVER MARY. SO MANY GOOD PEOPLE IN IN EDMONTON. SO MANY GOOD PEOPLE IN CANADA. GOD IS WATCHING OVER YOU. [screaming] &gt;&gt; WANTS YOU TO BE SAVED AND YOU WILL BE SAVED. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T ESCAPE IT BECAUSE HIS LOVE IS CONSTANTLY UPON YOU. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Mary was probably wondering that's why she you are favored Mary you are favored. &gt;&gt; Really? Me? What have I done? &gt;&gt; NO, YOU ARE FAVORED. GOD'S EYES IS UPON YOU. I'VE CHOSEN YOU. I HAVE SELECTED YOU. I WANT YOU TO BE THE ANSWER FOR THAT PROMISE OF GOD. THAT PROMISE OF GOD THAT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR 800 YEARS. FOR ISAIAH FOUND A WOMB IN MARY. &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE OF YAHWEH FOUND A WOMB INSIDE OF YOU. &gt;&gt; THE PEOPLE REJECTED, BUT YOU HAVE ACCEPTED IT. &gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU ACCEPTED IT? BECAUSE GOD HAS PUT SOMETHING INSIDE OF YOU THAT HAS THE ABIL ABILITY TO GRASP THAT WORD OF GOD [screaming] BECAUSE GOD LOVES YOU. &gt;&gt; NEVER LET THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE world try to to to diminish that love of God. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THE life of Mary having the baby. She suffered more &gt;&gt; because she has to go that trip. She has probably she think wh why why? But that was inside of her was the blessing. &gt;&gt; THE GREATEST BLESSING FOR HUMANITY. &gt;&gt; THE GREATEST BLESSING FOR YOU IS WHAT GOD PUT INSIDE OF YOU. &gt;&gt; IT WILL MAKE YOU SUFFER, BUT IT'S YOUR BLESSING. &gt;&gt; IT MIGHT MAKE YOU SUFFER, BUT IT'S YOUR BLESSING. &gt;&gt; ONE DAY, ONE DAY AS A WOMAN, SHE GOES THROUGH MANY, BUT ONE DAY YOU WILL BE REJOICING. &gt;&gt; IT'S WORTH IT ALL. [screaming] THANK GOD FOR THAT YOU PUT INSIDE OF ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH, I feel like in India now. Oh [snorts] my my my. It says by and through the members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be made manifest in the virgin. really by you and through you God will fulfill the word of God that has to be manifested because you are the virgin bride of Jesus Christ in this time God could not do everything in time of Jesus Christ. God could not do even everything in TIME OF BROTHER BANNAM. GOD WANT YOU AND ME TO STEP IN TO DO THE REST OF THE WORK TO BE DEDICATED TO WORK FOR GOD TO BE CONSECRATED. AMEN. AND THEN GOD WILL TAKE YOU AND USE YOU. YOU'LL MOVE YOUR FAMILY. YOU'LL MOVE AT YOUR WORK. YOU'LL MOVE THE PLACE WHERE YOU ARE IN SIMPLICITY. AMEN. BUT YOU ARE THE [screaming] GLORY OF GOD. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE WHERE GOD WANT TO MANIFEST HIS GLORY. &gt;&gt; YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; The word of promise came to the Virgin Mary. But that word of promise was he himself to be made manifest. God was made manifest. He himself acted at that time and fulfilled his own word of promise in the virgin. You what you need to have is just to take the word of God. Let it be done to me according to thy word. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT MARY HAD TO DO JUST TO ACCEPT THE WORD FOR HER SEASON. &gt;&gt; Let be done TO ME ACCORDING TO THY WORD. &gt;&gt; MARY WAS FAVORED. SHE WAS CHOSEN. YOU ARE FAVORED. YOU ARE CHOSEN. MARY RECEIVED THE ANGEL. YOU HAVE RECEIVED THE ANGEL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE PROPHET says the angel Gabriel CAME FOR THE FIRST VISITATION OF JESUS CHRIST. HE WILL COME FOR THE second visitation OF JESUS CHRIST. THE SAME WORD THAT WAS IN MARY, THE SAME WORD THAT IS IN YOU TOO. AMEN. SO YOU ARE FAVORED. AMEN. YOU HAVE RECEIVED THE ANGEL OF GOD. GOD HAS VISITED YOU. AMEN. BECAUSE YOU ARE THE BELIEVER OF THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. GOD HAS VISITED YOU. AS Eleza could not understand or maybe Rebecca could not understand that she was actually an answer to a prayer. &gt;&gt; She was just there doing the usual things and she come she taking water but there was a prophet was praying for her. &gt;&gt; Oh God may you give me that one who will give me water and we give also to the camels the water. &gt;&gt; The prophet says actually the angel was there 30 minutes before before Alza came. YOU MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND YOUR LIFE. BUT GOD WAS IN YOUR LIFE. BEFORE ANYTHING BEFORE SOMEONE SHARED THE WORD OF GOD WITH YOU, GOD WAS THERE.

BECAUSE THEIR TESTIMONY IS actually God sometimes make them to go through that so that can be an encouragement for many others. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So but the angel's message was the word of God that have you have received. This is the word of God. The message of the hour is the word of God. It's not the thought of a man. It's not the thought of a sixth or seventh grade person. IT'S THE WORD OF GOD DIRECTLY FROM THE THRONE OF GOD TO SPEAK TO US. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THROUGH WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; As Mary receive the word of God. This is the word of God. For unto us a child.

Amen. That's a promise. But it came fulfilled to that little young girl 16 years old or so. Little young girl. But she just had the faith in the word of God. Prophet one thing says God give us more Marys. We want more Marys. Lord make me a Mary. &gt;&gt; MAKE ME A MARY. JUST ACCEPT YOUR WORD. LORD STAY IN THE ATMOSPHERE [screaming] OF YOUR WORD. FATHER KEEP MY MIND UPON THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; PROVERBS SAY her her secret, one of her secret was keeping the word of God in her mind. Thinking about the word of God, thinking about that scripture, think about what the preacher spoke there this morning. And she was thinking about meditating upon that. Prophet says the same thing for us. The more we meditate upon the word of God, the more the angel will visit us, THE ANGEL SHOULD VISIT US. WE are message believer. Angel visiting us should not be something very extraordinary. Man, it should be a common thing for believers. Sometimes you don't like the bloom and everything, but you think about the word of God, you see that the atmosphere change. YOU DON'T SEE IT, BUT THE ANGEL IS THERE. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE MY DAUGHTER. You are my son. The word of God is your strength. Just keep moving on. Make a little whisper of prayer. Thank God for your grace. Thank you, your grace, for your grace. Thank you for saving me, Lord. Thank you, Father, for watching over me. Thank you for healing ME, LORD. I DON'T UNDERSTAND BUT I KEEP TRUSTING IN YOU. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE WORD THE TRUTH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Say fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because she accepted his word to her. She just accepted. Lord accept your word. The members of the virgin bride we love him. and they will have his potential for he is their head and all power belongs to him. Oh, I love this one. It's not my might. It's not my my strength. IT'S GOD'S POTENTIAL. &gt;&gt; SHE WILL HAVE GOD'S POTENTIAL. &gt;&gt; YOU WILL HAVE GOD POTENTIALS. HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN? IT WILL BE THE POWER OF GOD USING YOU BECAUSE GOD IS THE WORD OF GOD. We could not produce the bride revival in the time of Luther. No matter how much I think I mentioned it earlier, no matter how much he has read the Bible from from Genesis to Revelation, they've they were scribes. They were writing it out. They memorized it. They knew everything. But they could not bring the bride revival like in our time. &gt;&gt; THAT WORD OF GOD HAD TO BE REVEALED. IT HAD TO BE OPEN. IT HAD TO BE CLEAR SO THAT WE CAN HAVE FAITH IN THE WORD OF GOD. NOW AS WE HAVE FAITH IN THE WORD OF GOD, IT GIVES US THE POTENTIAL OF GOD TO CREATE [screaming] NOW A BODY CHANGE. WE ARE MESSAGE BELIEVER FOR THE RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; OUR FOCUS IS THE RAPTURE. OUR FOCUS IS THE BODY [screaming] CHANGE. AMEN. OUR FOCUS IS NOT THIS WORLD. OUR FOCUS IS THE BODY CHANGE. AND EVERYTHING IS INCLUDED IN THAT BODY CHANGE. WE ARE IN THE SEASON TO GO. AMEN. THE SEASON FOR A THIRD EXODUS. AMEN. THE SEASON FOR GOING HOME. THE SAINTS OF OLD [screaming] ARE WAITING ON YOU. ARE WAITING ON ME. AMEN. THEY WITHOUT ASK CANNOT BE MADE PERFECT. &gt;&gt; IS IT MY STRENGTH? IS IT MY NO. [screaming] IS THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THE MORE YOU EAT THE WORD OF GOD, THE MORE YOU BECOME THE WORD OF GOD, THE MORE IT WILL DO THE WORK. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I give you a challenge. Make a Friday evening for your family. If there's no youth meeting, put a tape for 15 minutes. Just oh family, let's gather. Put a tape of it. You'll see the revival in this church. Just put a tape, gather around, listen to it for 15 minutes, then pray. Is that too hard? No. Just put that for you'll see a revival in this church because it's not our potentials. It's God's potential. [snorts] &gt;&gt; HE WILL DO THE WAY. WE GET DISTRACTED so many times and we forget the power of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So they are subject to him as the members of our bodies are subject to our heads. Notice the harmony of the father and the son. Jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father. John 5:19 says this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride. We look at Jesus Christ. We see the harmony between the father and Jesus Christ. As I said at the beginning, Jesus Christ was the firstborn. Jesus Christ was the wave shift, the first fruit. But God was thinking about you and me. is showing us an example so that the same thing will happen between JESUS CHRIST AND US TO HAVE THE SAME HARMONY TO HAVE THE MIND OF CHRIST TO WALK THE WAY HE WALKED. AMEN. IS IT BY ME? NO. BY THE POWER OF THE WORD OF GOD, BY THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, BY THE POWER OF THE DYNAMICS. AMEN. UNVEILING OF GOD, UNVEILING OF THE MIGHTY GOD AMONG US IS GOING TO do the same thing. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Now it says he shows her his word of life. She receives it once again. She accepted it. Now she receives it. This is part of me. This is my word. It's not only for the parents. This is mine. &gt;&gt; It's not only for the husband. This is mine. It's not only for my wife. This is mine. I receive it. She never doubts it. Now he says, "Therefore, nothing can harm her." &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, nothing can harm you. &gt;&gt; THE GATES OF OF HELL CAN COME TOWARDS YOU, BUT THEY WILL NOT harm you. &gt;&gt; They will not harm your real you. They will NOT HARM YOUR SOUL. AMEN. THEY MUST A LITTLE BIT MIGHT DISTURB YOUR MIND. THEY MIGHT DISTURB IT THIS BODY. BUT YOUR REAL YOU, THEY CAN NEVER TOUCH IT. THEY CAN NEVER HARM IT. THEY CAN NEVER DECEIVE IT. THEY CAN NEVER TAKE YOU FROM GOD BECAUSE YOU ARE PART OF GOD. YOU ARE THE BELOVED BRIDE. AMEN. NOTHING CAN HARM YOU. YOU WILL MAKE IT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; EVEN AGAINST YOUR OWN WILL, I'M TELLING YOU, YOU WILL MAKE IT. &gt;&gt; IF YOU ARE THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST PREDESTINATED, YOU WILL MAKE IT. If he has ALREADY TAKEN YOU UPON THAT HOOK. AMEN. YOU might go and then try. Oh, as a brother, one brother preached the other. It's like it's like it's like a GPS. GPS. The destination is already there. You might go it recalculation recalculation. RECALCULATION. BUT THE DESTINATION IS ALREADY SET. YOU HAVE TO GO [screaming] TO THAT DESTINATION. YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN. YOU WILL GO THERE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, thank God for this love letter. &gt;&gt; I will cherish it, Lord. I love this letter, Lord. &gt;&gt; For telling me who I am. &gt;&gt; I did not know who I was. I thought that I was just a little Mary walking around here and drawing water and but now you are telling me that I've been part of the PROPHECY ALL THESE YEARS. Thank you for opening my mind to see that Lord that I'm PART OF THE PLAN OF REDEMPTION. I AM PART OF YOU. I WILL BE BEARING JESUS CHRIST IN THIS LAST AGE IN THE TIME OF LEODYSIA. MARY born from a city from a PLACE WHERE THERE WAS BAD REPUTATION. CAN ANYTHING COME OF THAT PLACE? NO ONE COULD BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING PURE CAN COME FROM THAT PLACE. IN THIS TIME OF LOVE THIS YEAR, NO ONE COULD BELIEVE THAT WE COULD HAVE A BRIDE. BUT IT IS IN THIS TIME THAT GOD IS TAKING OUT THE MARY ONCE AGAIN TO SHOW HIS GLORY, [screaming] TO SHOW HIS POWER THAT SHE WILL MAKE IT. SHE WON'T FAIL. NOTHING WILL HARM HER. THANK GOD. [screaming] THANK GOD. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank God. &gt;&gt; That's why I love him. because I was so unlovable in this TOWN IN THIS CITY. BUT HE came and he chose me from the PLACE WHERE I WAS. The angel visited me. He told me I'm favorite of my father to fulfill the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Glory to his name. &gt;&gt; Therefore, nothing can harm not even death. For if the seed be planted, the water will raise it up again. Here is the secret of this. Now, here is the secret that the emphasis. Here is the secret. The word is in the bride as it was in Mary. Sisters, you're going to forgive me moment. A secret was inside. She's not like other people walking around and they don't see her like like a regular but the secret was inside. &gt;&gt; The word was in Mary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your secret, your strength is the word of God &gt;&gt; inside of you. That's your secret. &gt;&gt; Not outside. Not Isaiah just in the in the in in the letter for no Isaiah but inside of you now it becomes your strength she's working there the secret people didn't know but she knew what she was Bible say she was pondering on the things that she heard pondering because that's my strength I might go through trials but that's still my strength &gt;&gt; amen sister sometimes you go when you go to the doctor being pregnantated by the word of God. That's your secret. Because once you are pregnantated by the word of God, nothing of the world can come. Because you already pregnantated by the word of God. PEOPLE CAN COME AND criticize the message, CRITICIZE YOUR CHURCH, CRITICIZE PEOPLE. YOU ARE TOO LATE. I'M ALREADY BEING PREGNANT BY THE WORD OF GOD. I'M STILL I'M [screaming] INSIDE. AMEN. NOTHING CAN COME. IT WAS HAPPEN IN THE TIME BEFORE BEFORE ADAM COULD COME TO TO EVE, she was pregnant. Now God is doing the other way around. NOW FOR MARY, BEFORE JOSEPH CAME TO MARY, &gt;&gt; NOW MARY WAS PREGNANT BY THE WORD OF GOD. THANK GOD I RECEIVED THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR BEFORE AI, BEFORE ANY OTHER THING, BEFORE. THANK GOD I'VE BEEN PREGNANT BY THE WORD OF GOD. NOTHING CAN CHANGE MY MIND. NOTHING CAN REVERSE ME. I'M DESTINED TO GO ALL THE WAY [screaming] BECAUSE I'VE BEEN PREGNANT BY THE word of God. People will come, why are you doing those things? WHY YOU DON'T SMOKE? WHY YOU DON'T DRINK? Why you dressing that way? The secret, I'm protecting the pregnancy. &gt;&gt; It's not the law, is it? &gt;&gt; I'm protecting my baby. &gt;&gt; I'm protecting what I've received. It's part of me. If I do those things, I WILL DIE. SO, I'M PROTECTING WHAT I HAVE RECEIVED. AMEN. IT'S PART OF ME. IT'S MY STRENGTH. IT'S MY SECRET. I CHERISH IT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And in other way, now you go further on and is it progressing? Is it progressing? Is it progressing? The more you eat the word of God, the more that word, that seed, small thing. Maybe you just accepted the Lord Jesus Christ. The true baptism has to be in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Maybe that's the only thing you receive at the beginning. Not many things. But I've been baptized in the name of the father, the son, or the holy ghost. No, that's not a true baptism. You have to redo it again in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Maybe that was that small seed that you received inside of you. But as you ponder it and it becomes more and more real, more and more real. It's growing. It's growing. It's growing. It's growing. It's growing. It's growing. Before people realize, oh yeah, you put on weight. What's going on? Oh, IT'S WHAT I'M FEEDING ON. WHAT I'M FEELING ON IS CHANGING MY LIFE. IT'S CHANGING MY WALK. IT'S CHANGING MY THINKING. AMEN. When I when I got the first first first child, you know, the the the fever of the first child, my wife really spoiled me. She was spoiled on that one cuz I I want to eat this. I buy it for her. I want this. Bye for sweetheart. Where are you getting those strange desires all of a sudden? is changing inside. Forgive me, sister. Right. Something is changing inside because of what I have received inside. Is changing my desires. I used to love the things of the world. Now I don't love them anymore. What happened? Something inside of me has changed. I've been pregnantated with the life of Jesus Christ. It's changing my life. IT'S CHANGING MY DESIRES. IT'S making me A NEW PERSON. AMEN. IT'S CHANGING EVEN MY WALK. AMEN. HE'S CHANGING MY DRESS. A pregnant woman doesn't dress tight things. No, you you you are protecting your femininity and you don't wear things that you you don't even know how to walk. I'll touch that on godliness one time. It's kind of pregnant woman doesn't respect yourself. But when the real woman, even a motherhood shows up, she becomes sweet. say she becomes soft and sweet. No wonder the bride of Jesus Christ the last day she's becoming sweet and lovely because she has been pregnantated by the word of God life of Jesus Christ. Can you imagine Jehovah God as a seed in a woman? [snorts] &gt;&gt; The same thing JEHOVAH GOD taking the seed in that woman. The same thing in the last age. There's the word of God is coming seed in the womb of a virgin now. You and me. You and me. That's what God is doing in our time. And it's changing our lives. He's changing our our affections. He's changing the way we we walk. Amen. But on the other hand, you know what? People is making fun of her. S look at that one. She say no husband but regard she was hiding it now make fun of her. She go to trials and different things. Why? Because she's the promise of God being fulfilled. You might be persecuted. You might be going through trials. You might make fun of you. the things that give the blessings but the things that will brought more trials, more difficult things. The same for what we are going through. BUT AT THE END OF ALL IT ALL, THANK GOD ONE DAY I WILL GIVE BIRTH AND I WILL FORGET ALL MY TRIALS. I'LL FORGET ALL MY PAINS, ALL MY BIRTH PAINS. THANK GOD I'LL BE I'LL BE A NEW CREATURE. THANK GOD THIS BODY WILL BE CHANGED. [screaming] NO SUFFERING, NOTHING ELSE. IT'S WORTH IT ALL. THANK GOD. [groaning] &gt;&gt; So she says the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word. She has the mind of how can you have the mind of Christ? Only through the word of God. The more you eat the word of God, the more you're having the mind of Christ. as we go to India there. I told them, "Oh, it's strange. I've not met you. The moment I meet a real believer, we just think the same way. &gt;&gt; We we we fellowship this on the same topics and the things like we met before. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SAME MIND. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE ARE TAKING FROM THE SAME SOURCE. THE MORE YOU FEED UPON THE MORE YOU BECOME ONE with it AND BECOMES THE SAME MIND OF CHRIST THE EVERYWHERE EVERYWHERE THE MESSAGE GOES IT PRODUCE THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST IT'S NOT A MAN MANMADE SYSTEM GOD [screaming] WORD DOING THE WORK IN THIS LAST age you have the mind of Christ you think like Christ your opinion is like the opinion of God himself why because you have been feeding upon the word of God &gt;&gt; important to feed upon the word of God. Brothers and sisters, it's our secret. That's why the secret is inside of you. Take the word of inside of you. That's the secret to overcome in this last age. The secret is the word inside of you. Revelation 10 8 to 11. TAKE THE WORD OF GOD, PUT INSIDE OF YOU, EAT IT UP. [screaming] AMEN. IT MIGHT BE SWEET IN THE CHURCH. SWEET AND WHEN IT BECOMES BITTER, BUT AT LEAST IT'S THERE. PUSH IT UP. STAY THERE. &gt;&gt; STAY THERE. YOU FEEL LIKE VOMITING. IT'S PART OF IT. IT'S PART OF BIRTH PAIN. THE PART OF IT. STAY WITH IT. KEEP WALKING WITH IT. AMEN. BECOMES HARD. KEEP WALKING WITH IT. IT will give you a body change one time. &gt;&gt; Says she performs the command of the word in his name. For she has saved the Lord. She has not saved the Lord. We have that save the Lord. It's not a man's idea. It's that save the Lord. We did not have that save the Lord. If Eve had if he if Eve had used that save the Lord, she would have overcome. But now God has given us that save the Lord. Amen. Says now the word is quickened by the spirit and comes to pass. Like a seed that is planted and watered, it comes to full harvest serving its purpose. Those in the bride do only his will. No one can make them do otherwise. Thank God. NO ONE CAN MAKE THEM DO OTHERWISE. No matter how they pushed, no, they can't do otherwise because they have that save the Lord or they keep still. They know that it has to be God in them doing the works. Fulfilling his own word. It's not you. IT'S GOD DOING THE WORK INSIDE OF YOU. HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT? BECAUSE BY MYSELF I COULDN'T DO IT. BUT GOD IS COMING AND DOING THE WORK. &gt;&gt; WHAT I'VE DONE, I JUST ACCEPTED IT. ONCE I ACCEPTED IT, IT COMES AND MATERIALIZE INSIDE OF ME. THE SECRET OF ANY PROMISE OF GOD IS TO ACCEPT IT. You accepted it, then the word of God will materialize about what YOU HAVE ACCEPTED. YOU WANT HEALING, ACCEPT THE WORD OF GOD. HEALING WILL MATERIALIZE AROUND THAT WORD OF GOD. AMEN. YOU WANT SALVATION, ACCEPT IT. IT WILL MATERIALIZE AROUND THE WORD OF GOD. THE KEY IS TO ACCEPT THE WORD OF GOD. BELIEVE IT. GOD WILL DO THE REST FOR YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Say he did not complete. This is tremendous. This is God speaking to the wife, the bride that he loves you and me. Says God did not complete or Jesus did not complete all his work while in his first ministry, earthly ministry. So now he works in and through the bride. Through the bride, school through the bride. Jesus was not maybe a mechanic but today we have Jesus as a mechanic. Jesus was not a doctor but today we have Jesus as a doctor. Jesus was not an accountant but today we have Jesus as an accountant because he's doing the work through you &gt;&gt; the glory of God. It says so now he works in and through the bride. He she he know she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do. But he will now fulfill through the bride the work which he left for this specific time. &gt;&gt; This is our time. The prophecy were not for the other age but this is our time. The more we stay in the word of God, God will fulfill that because it is the season for this specific time of the word of GOD TO BE FULFILLED. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Let me go quickly read some quote and then I will close give many things I could have thought of but it's it's good. Prophet just Mary's Mary's belief. Prophet says the Bible if there be any praise, if there be any virtue, think on these things. I think the reason we don't see no more of it than we do, we got our minds on too many other things. I think the angels will still appear to us if we only kept our minds upon them. But we are thinking about something else. That's where we are going. A certain program we've got to look at or certain shopping we have to do. But our scriptures tells us first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these other things will be added unto you. Unto you. Amen. Says another message. Jehovah of miracles says it's too bad that the church doesn't today walk in the spirit like that more than we do. For it's kind of a time where God comes to you says the trouble says trouble with the world. Today we are thinking about everything else but him. Then we wonder why we don't get blessings. Begin to think that you are one of his children. It says for that he saved you, that he's good to you, that you love him and he loves you. Don't just wait till you go to church or some convenient hour. Just keep him on your mind all the time. Think that he loves you, that you love him. Amen. Just keep thinking about that all the time. Praise be to God. says about when I set up some then he says he say begin to think it was there for the first time he came and declared the new ministry to me this is giving an example brother banham seen the life of brother banam great miracle or great thing that happened the third pull through him create a square speak the word of go he was thinking about the scripture of the word of god then the holy spirit came and oh you're thinking about that you know about mark 11 what about if you do you need something say yeah I need some scripture yeah speak the word of god that secret thinking about God's thing. Amen. God's word. Amen. Think about God's word. Great things will happen. You know, think of the translation, the ministry translation. You will think upon, oh, I'm getting old. I need to work for God now. I need to then the voice came. Do you want do would it would it do good to you if you see on the other side what it is? Says, yes, Lord, that would be good. Starting by thinking upon God. So now we have so many distractions. Now this year I'm busy busy busy busy busy busy but it's good sometime to stop moment. Oh God thank you for your love in my life. Thank you for the word. Lord I love you. That moment you continue doing what you are doing but still keep your mind upon God. It says were thinking on the scripture. That was the scripture that was confirmed to her. If you are sick, think on that scripture. If you are lost, think on that scripture. If you want the Holy Spirit, think on that scripture. No. And the Holy Spirit will confirm it to you. Amen. So think about any any issue, any situation you're going, take the word of God, think about it, re accept it, receive it. The word of God will materialize upon the scripture. Amen. Just keeping safe time here says um but that little girl didn't have nothing. She never questioned anymore. His word was enough for her. If the church could just get like that the word set the word settles it. If God said so that's all we need to know. How is it going to be? I can't tell you. But if God get said so, that's going to be that way. Amen. Mary had to believe something that never happened. We've got thousands of examples of divine healing. Look at the people's been healed with cancer, blindness, dumbness, deafness, all kinds of sicknesses and diseases. We've got plenty of that to look at as examples. But this little girl didn't have nothing but just his word. And that was sufficient. His word was good enough for her. The word of God is good enough for us. We don't want need anything. We just need the word of God. Then he says in Jehovah of Jer, give us more Marys Lord around here that can take God at his word and praise him whether you feel it or any whether you feel anything or not. Take him at his word. God is trying to find somebody will take his word. Mary didn't have anything she could put. Elizabeth, I'm feeling something. No, she just testify about the word of God. She prophesy about the word of God. Then it will came to pass. Amen. Says by taking his word changed Mary's belief. Changed his whole natural course of life for her. It will do the same thing for you. &gt;&gt; If he did for her, it will do the same thing for you. Mary had to believe the impossibles. God takes the impossibles and makes them real when he's taken at his word. The doctor might have said you'll never get rid of that cancer. The doctor might have said you'll never be able to walk again. Well, it's impossible for you to do it. But impossible fades out when God's taken at his word. No matter what the doctor says, he's go is doing the best HE CAN. BUT GOD IS GOD. AMEN. AND his word is just like he is. If you take his word, that settles it forever. If you can't believe, you can't believe. Say to this mountain, "Be moved." And don't doubt in your heart. you will believe what you have said will come to pass and you can have what you said. Amen. &gt;&gt; I just want to read what the prophet says here about the mystery of translation and then be closing. Um it's it's one of my favorite go but I always get missed somewhere but give me. Yes. So the question and answers are 64. I think I need to put it in a different color so I know. Um, so it says they asked the prophet what explain to us the mean the mean the the the the secret of the explain to us the secret of the translation. Explain the mystery of the translation of the bride. It says Abraham he was looking for a promised son that was promised. Romans 4. Is that right? And the church is looking for a promised son. The bride is is that right? The bride is looking for the promised son. And it says we cannot receive the promised son that is promised us today in this body that we live in. These bodies are sin. Romans 7:18. For I know in that in my flesh dwelleth no good for for to will is present with me and how to perform which is good I find not. The first conscience control this body with taste with see, taste, feel, smell and hear. It's just as God all screwed up. We reason and everything else. But the new body that comes from this born again, not this first conscience will pass out. It's that inside something that lives. It's not the outside here. Taste, feel, smell, and here it is in it's subject to death and life. But the inside part of you down in here inside is the person that cannot die. &gt;&gt; The new birth is the word of God revealed to you personally. is the word of God born with the seed uncorruptible seed of the word of God inside of you. It says but the inside it's subject to death. The inside some the it's that inside something that lives. It says it's not the outside the it's the outside subject to death and will die. But the inside part of you down in your inside that is the person that cannot die. See that's the person that the new life starts from from this new birth. And it builds another person in the image of this person that you are around that life. You get it? So potentially it's here what it is. The word promise before the foundation of the world and around there the only reflect the negative that reflect the positive the word and the translation of the bride will be the same thing. The word that in in you the body will materialize around that word. It could not materialize around in other ages. But now the full word of God has come. And when you receive it, the translation will start by materializing around that word of God that you have received. &gt;&gt; That's the secret. Just take the word of God inside. Take the word of God inside. Take the word of God inside. It will give if it will give us the body change how much more for the natural thing that we are going through the secret. Take the word of God make it real inside of you. Do you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Let's give a hand to the Lord. [applause] For behold, I show you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkle of an eye, at the last trump. &gt;&gt; That scripture is our scripture. &gt;&gt; And it's being fulfilled every day as you receive the word of God. It's becoming more and more real. And one day it will be a quick change. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise be to God. Let the words be born. It's good. We thank God for the message we have received. It's a tremendous word of God that can never be changed. Amen. Brother, we can prepare this slide as well as we sing that song. can sing. Maybe I feel the pool. I hear the word. Do you know that song? You know it. Okay. If you know it, then we sing it. Let the world be born in the manger of God. And the word be born in a manger of my oh let your word in the manger of let it live. &gt;&gt; Let's stand together. &gt;&gt; Let's just give us a prayer the Lord. inside this house of pain and it let your word. &gt;&gt; Do you know the verse? You know the verse is Now think about you and me. &gt;&gt; Just a simple man, just a simple lady. &gt;&gt; That's the scripture being fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Lord, this my desire.

Father, because this is a specific time for the word to be made flesh, the word to be fulfilled, the word to be made real. Lord, I open my heart to your word and I accept you, Father. Remember your bride in this little congregation, Father. God, Lord, I put the word in front of the people, Father. Lord, it has challenged to accept the word. Father, you'll do the rest, Father. It's not my word. It's not a man a word of a man. It's not even a word of a father of a prophet. But is the word of God himself. We have thus say the Lord. Not even that save the prophet, but that save the Lord. Thank you Lord for that save the Lord. We accept it. We believe it. We receive it. Father, you know the needs among us. Need of healing, Father. need for a touch, need for our Lord for our walk, a closer walk with you. But we accept your word, Lord. Despite our weaknesses, we look to your word and believe it and accept it and want to live. Bless your people, Father. Give them the desire of the heart. Pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. people &gt;&gt; in the manger of our heart. &gt;&gt; Let me [music] let it live inside this house of &gt;&gt; and mold [music] it every day.
