[43:16] made.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. This is the day. Can we
[43:21] sing it a little bit better? Amen. Let's
[43:23] sing it one more time. But let's really
[43:25] sing it. If we really mean it.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; This is the day.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; This is the day [music and singing] that

[44:06] This is the day [music] that the Lord
[44:10] has made.
[44:14] Praise the Lord. Amen. Just like our
[44:16] brother Joseph said, we're waiting for
[44:19] his coming. This is the day of his
[44:22] coming.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; Now, we know he's already come,
[44:26] &gt;&gt; but we're waiting for his physical
[44:28] coming.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Is it wonderful that he's come?
[44:33] &gt;&gt; That we know that he will come
[44:34] physically.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. All his promises are true. Amen.
[44:39] This morning, we want to give all the
[44:41] time to our brother Steven. Amen. Amen.
[44:45] We've we How many have heard brother

[44:50] How long ago? Maybe two years.
[44:53] Longer. Longer. Amen. We I guess we've
[44:57] forgotten you, brother. [laughter]
[45:00] Amen. But I know that in the beginning,
[45:02] you know, maybe a few years ago, we've
[45:05] had you here in the service and we're so
[45:07] very happy to have you this morning.
[45:10] Praiseful, the name of Jesus. Amen. So,
[45:14] we're going to welcome our brother
[45:17] to preach to us and he will bring to us
[45:20] the message of the hour. Amen. He comes
[45:23] from goodto.
[45:28] Amen. Brother
[45:30] his father is a is a wonderful preacher.
[45:33] He's a teacher. Amen. I'm sure the boys
[45:37] have learned a lot from him. But you
[45:39] know, they got their own personal
[45:40] revelation.
[45:42] Can you say amen, brother Stephen? So,
[45:44] we welcome brother Steven. Why don't you
[45:45] come, brother Stephen? Why don't we
[45:46] welcome them all? Amen. Welcome, brother
[45:49] Steven. Come and take your liberty
[45:52] and preach the word of God to us. Amen.
[45:55] This the congregation is very
[45:57] responsive.
[45:58] They want to hear the word. And when
[46:00] they hear the word, don't be
[46:02] interrupted. We will say amen.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Can we say amen?
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Can we say hallelujah?
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Can we SAY PRAISE THE LORD?
[46:12] I FEEL LIKE I'M IN INDIA.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN. But you know, I don't regret those
[46:16] brothers being in India. It's a it's a
[46:19] tough time. It's not easy. I'll tell you
[46:22] what. I don't like the food for once.
[46:26] And I don't like the accommodations
[46:28] sometimes and the outhouses. Amen. So, I
[46:31] don't enjoy those things. I'm here glad
[46:33] that I'm here this morning. Amen. So,
[46:36] you could be happy this morning.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be yourself and praise the
[46:40] Lord. Come, brother Steven, and enjoy
[46:43] yourself and have liberty to preach the
[46:45] word of God to us.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come, brother.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; I think so.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; All right. It sounds like it's on.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Certainly is wonderful to be here with
[47:02] you once again. And uh it was quite a
[47:05] few years ago when I was here last time.
[47:08] So, most of you probably weren't here,
[47:10] but uh I remember Sister Kathy was here
[47:14] and I don't remember. Were you married
[47:16] when I was here last?
[47:19] I don't remember if Were you here,
[47:21] brother? You were here. All right. So,
[47:24] you you were here. And All right.
[47:28] It's good to be here.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; It's good to be a Christian. Amen.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; It's good to be living in this day.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:36] Why don't we stand together? And [music]
[47:38] I think that's all the singing that
[47:40] we'll do, sister. Thank you for the song
[47:41] service this morning. Sure appreciated
[47:43] it. Enjoyed the specials. Amen.
[47:48] Let's turn in our Bibles. We're going to
[47:50] turn to chapter 3.
[47:57] Brother Sig was doing such a good job up
[47:59] here. I was hoping he was just going to
[48:01] carry right on and
[48:12] very familiar scripture to us. I think
[48:16] by this time in our walk with the Lord,
[48:20] there's not too many scriptures that
[48:22] aren't become familiar to us. Amen.
[48:26] But the more we hear them, the more we
[48:28] fall in love with the word of God.
[48:31] Amen. Just before we read, why don't we
[48:33] just bow our heads together in prayer.
[48:36] Heavenly Father,
[48:38] Lord, you have given us this opportunity
[48:41] to be together. Lord, gathered with
[48:44] saints of like precious faith. Amen.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Lord, our desire this morning is not to
[48:49] come and be seen of one another, but
[48:51] Lord, that we might come into your
[48:53] presence, oh God. That we might be seen
[48:56] of you, Lord. And that you might look
[48:58] down upon us. And because Lord, you know
[49:02] our needs, oh God. And you know our
[49:05] trials that we are facing. And Lord, you
[49:08] know the the struggles. You know the way
[49:09] we are made, Lord, because you have
[49:11] formed us, oh God. And Lord, you molded
[49:14] us in this way that we would be the
[49:16] person that we are today. But Lord, we
[49:18] know that we have not yet arrived, Lord,
[49:21] where we want to be. We have not yet
[49:24] arrived, Lord, where you are bringing us
[49:27] to. For Lord, if we were at that place,
[49:29] we wouldn't be here in this body of
[49:32] mortal flesh this morning. But we would
[49:34] be on the other side rejoicing with the
[49:36] saints. But Lord, we believe that you
[49:39] have gathered us here this morning
[49:41] because you have something more for us,
[49:43] oh God. Because you want to take us
[49:46] deeper into your word. And Lord, as the
[49:48] Apostle Paul said, Lord, his desire was
[49:51] that we would know the depths of the
[49:54] love of God, the breadth of it, the
[49:56] height of it. And Lord, it is our desire
[50:00] to know you in that way, Father.
[50:03] Lord, you have opened your word to us in
[50:05] this day, Lord, as we have received the
[50:07] message of the hour. And Lord, we are
[50:10] just wanting to know you in the way that
[50:13] you desire to re to us. And Lord, we
[50:16] know the only thing that hinders us from
[50:18] going deeper with you is ourselves, oh
[50:21] God. And we just want to get ourselves
[50:23] out of the way, Lord. And Lord, we are
[50:26] our own enemy, Lord. And we just want to
[50:29] lay down this flesh. We want to lay down
[50:31] our carnal ideas. We want to lay down
[50:33] our own mind and we want to put on the
[50:35] mind of Christ. And Father, we just
[50:38] desire tonight that you would this
[50:40] morning that you would come and that you
[50:42] would just take the reading of the word
[50:43] and that you would anoint it. Father,
[50:45] bless the reading of it and bless the
[50:47] hearing of it. Lord, bless each one that
[50:50] has come this morning, Lord. And may you
[50:51] just take us into your presence this
[50:54] morning and of life. We pray in the
[50:57] precious name of Jesus Christ. A
[51:01] &gt;&gt; amen. Let's read from verse eight of
[51:04] Philippians chapter 3.
[51:07] It says, "Yay, doubtless I count all
[51:10] things but loss, for the excellency of
[51:14] the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord,
[51:17] for whom I have suffered the loss of all
[51:19] things, and do count them but dung, that
[51:22] I may win Christ, and be found in him,
[51:27] not having my own righteousness, which
[51:29] is of the law, but that which is through
[51:32] the faith of Christ, the righteousness
[51:35] which is of God, by faith that I may
[51:39] know him and the power of his
[51:41] resurrection
[51:43] &gt;&gt; and the fellowship of his sufferings
[51:45] being made conformable unto his death.
[51:48] If by any means I might attain unto the
[51:51] resurrection of the dead, not as though
[51:53] I had already attained, either were
[51:56] already perfect, but I follow after, if
[52:00] that I may apprehend that for which also
[52:03] I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.
[52:07] Brethren, I count not myself to have
[52:09] apprehended, but this one thing I do,
[52:14] forgetting those things which are
[52:16] behind, and reaching forth unto those
[52:19] things which are before, I press towards
[52:23] the mark for the prize of the high
[52:26] calling in Christ Jesus.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Let us therefore, as many as be perfect,
[52:32] be thus minded.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And may the Lord add his blessing
[52:36] to the word. You could have your seats.
[52:40] I want to speak this morning. If we were
[52:43] going to title the the service this
[52:45] morning, we would call it to be found in
[52:48] him.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; So Paul Paul is saying here,
[52:56] you know, we look to Paul as the example
[52:59] and brother Brandham looked to Paul as
[53:01] the example. And when he went on the
[53:03] other side and and he was caught up onto
[53:05] the other side and he seen the saints
[53:07] there and and he said they they he was
[53:11] gathered they said you're gathered with
[53:13] your people and and you'll have to give
[53:15] an answer for what you have said and and
[53:18] he said well will Paul have to give an
[53:20] answer and they said yes Paul will have
[53:22] to give an answer also. And and he said
[53:25] well I preached just what Paul preached
[53:29] &gt;&gt; and they said we're resting on that.
[53:31] We're resting on that. So, so, Brother
[53:33] Brandham looked to Paul as an as his
[53:36] example. He looked to the word and and
[53:38] the way that first church age messenger
[53:41] went out and and went with the with the
[53:44] the truth of the word, not compromising,
[53:47] not straying from the gospel, not uh
[53:50] turning right or left, but just staying
[53:52] with the word of God. And and that was
[53:55] his desire. And now Paul even being that
[53:58] example, even as he says in one place,
[54:00] being caught up to the third heaven and
[54:03] seeing things that he that it was not
[54:05] lawful for him to speak of and and all
[54:08] of these things that he saw yet he says
[54:11] it's it's my desire. I I don't run as
[54:14] though I have already attained. He saw
[54:17] things that we did not see. He was
[54:20] caught up into places that we have not
[54:22] been caught up into.
[54:23] So if anybody could say I've arrived,
[54:26] Paul could say I arrived. But he says I
[54:29] count not myself to have arrived. I
[54:32] count not myself to to have got to the
[54:34] place where where God is bringing me to.
[54:37] I but I I don't. He says not as though I
[54:41] already attained either were already
[54:44] perfect, but I follow after if that I
[54:48] may apprehend that for which I am
[54:50] apprehended of Christ. So he's saying
[54:53] Christ called me for a purpose
[54:56] &gt;&gt; and it is my desire to fulfill that
[54:59] purpose to fulfill all that I am called
[55:02] to be and and and to be all that God has
[55:07] made me to be. And he says that's my
[55:09] desire. I don't count myself to have
[55:11] apprehended but this one thing I do
[55:13] forgetting those things which are behind
[55:16] and reaching forth unto those things
[55:19] which are before. You know 10 years ago
[55:22] maybe you came to a place where you
[55:24] thought my I have never seen the word of
[55:26] God like I see it today. I have never
[55:28] felt so close to God as I feel today.
[55:32] But now today you can look back 10 years
[55:35] ago and say my I I didn't hardly know
[55:39] God back then. Yet back 10 years ago you
[55:42] felt like my I really know him. I feel
[55:44] so close to him. What is it? The Holy
[55:47] Spirit is always moving forward.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's always bringing us deeper
[55:51] into Christ and bringing us deeper into
[55:54] the truth of what God has for us, of who
[55:57] he is and of who we are.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; And and so Paul is saying, I'm I'm not
[56:03] looking back there. I'm not saying,
[56:05] well, I I'm not holding my anchor back
[56:08] on something else, but but I want to
[56:10] know Christ today.
[56:14] As Jesus when he taught us to pray, he
[56:16] said we ought to pray give us this day
[56:19] our daily bread.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Not Lord keep the bread from yesterday
[56:24] good for today but Lord give me today
[56:27] what I need today.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Every one of us needs to take a step
[56:31] forward today.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Maybe you took a step forward yesterday
[56:35] but today is a new day.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Today is another day. And and the Lord
[56:39] wants to bring you further today than
[56:42] you were yesterday. So he's saying,
[56:44] "Walk with me. Come further with me.
[56:47] Take another step with me." And if and
[56:49] if our hearts are open and and our minds
[56:52] are open to receive the word of God, he
[56:54] will take us step by step all the way
[56:57] into a rapture,
[56:59] &gt;&gt; all the way into a body change.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; We know that rapturing grace lies in the
[57:05] message of the hour.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; We know it's all lying there. But having
[57:09] those books on the shelf doesn't give us
[57:12] rapturing faith.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Reading those books, well, I read I read
[57:16] every message book, therefore I must
[57:19] have rapturing. No, but God is taking
[57:22] your faith to a place where your your
[57:25] faith will be rapturing faith.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; But we can't in our human minds, we
[57:31] can't comprehend it all at one time.
[57:35] So God, it reveals just as much as we
[57:38] can handle to take us the next step.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; So as long as we refuse to take the step
[57:45] that God has given us to take, then we
[57:47] can't go no further.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Then we're stuck there. Well, well, we
[57:52] I'll just wait for the I'll just wait
[57:54] for the next word that God's then then
[57:56] maybe I'll take that one. But Lord, I
[57:58] don't want this one. This one's too
[58:00] hard. This one's too difficult. I I
[58:03] don't want to have to go through this. I
[58:05] don't want to have to deal with this,
[58:06] Lord. It's It's too hard. As long as we
[58:09] refuse to follow the leadership of the
[58:11] Holy Spirit, we can't go no further.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; So, we've got to take the word that God
[58:17] has given us and apply it in our lives.
[58:22] And and as you feed on the message of
[58:24] the hour, you you those of you that have
[58:26] been in the message for a long time, you
[58:28] know this that that you read the same
[58:31] message that you read last week, the
[58:34] same message you read last year, and it
[58:36] seems like you're reading a whole new
[58:38] message.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Why? Because God is is opening your eyes
[58:42] to something that you need today.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Last week, last year, you needed
[58:47] something different. But today, God has
[58:50] something for you for what you have need
[58:53] of today.
[59:02] [snorts]
[59:03] &gt;&gt; So Paul says, I count all things but
[59:07] loss for the excellency of the knowledge
[59:10] of Christ.
[59:12] Nothing else matters in life. Nothing
[59:15] else matters but to know him. That's
[59:18] right.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; We've got to recognize where our
[59:20] blessings come from in life.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Seek ye first the
[59:25] kingdom of God
[59:26] &gt;&gt; and his righteousness and all these
[59:29] things shall be added unto you."
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Says, "Having food and raignment, be
[59:34] content." Says, "The heavenly father
[59:36] knows that you have need of all these
[59:39] other things."
[59:41] So, you know, we we get a new car, we
[59:43] get a new job, we get we get married, we
[59:46] have children, we get a home, and we
[59:49] begin to worry about those things. We
[59:52] begin to worry, well, well, how do I
[59:54] keep if if I don't keep this job, how am
[59:56] I going to keep this car? If if I don't
[59:58] keep if I don't get this promotion, how
[1:00:00] am I going to afford my mortgage
[1:00:02] payment?
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; But the that's not what the Lord told
[1:00:08] us. He said, "Seek first the kingdom of
[1:00:10] God
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; and all these things shall be." So if
[1:00:13] you were seeking the kingdom of God
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; and you found yourself with a good job,
[1:00:20] it was a blessing from the Lord.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; If you were seeking the kingdom of God
[1:00:24] and he provided you with the vehicle, it
[1:00:27] was a blessing from the Lord. If you
[1:00:29] were seeking the kingdom of God and and
[1:00:31] he provided you with the home, it was a
[1:00:33] blessing from the Lord. So why should we
[1:00:36] worry about our homes? Why should we
[1:00:38] worry about our cars? Why should we
[1:00:40] worry about our jobs?
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; He knows what we have need of and and he
[1:00:45] will give us a blessing according to our
[1:00:48] needs.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; So but what he's called us to do is he's
[1:00:51] called us to seek after the kingdom of
[1:00:54] God and his righteousness.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; So let us not get distracted in this
[1:01:00] leodyian age about all of these things
[1:01:03] that are around us. All of these things
[1:01:05] that we can have, all of these things
[1:01:06] that we can add to our life, allow God
[1:01:09] to do the adding.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; And if he has done the adding, then no
[1:01:14] man can take it away.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; That's right. But if it's us that did
[1:01:20] the adding, if it's us that that that
[1:01:23] that got the debt, and it's us that that
[1:01:26] struggled, and it's us that pushed, and
[1:01:28] it's us that had to have the new car,
[1:01:30] and it's us that had to have the nice
[1:01:32] house, and it's us that that had to have
[1:01:34] the the beautiful clothes, and and and
[1:01:36] the expensive things all adding. It's us
[1:01:40] that, well, I just have to have it. I
[1:01:41] just ha I gotta look like sister so and
[1:01:44] so. I gotta drive like brother so and
[1:01:46] so. And we got to have then then no
[1:01:48] matter how much we struggle, we're not
[1:01:50] going to be able to hold on to those
[1:01:52] things.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; So we've got to let go and we've got to
[1:01:56] let God have his way. Amen.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Paul says, "I counted all but loss for
[1:02:05] the excellency of the knowledge of
[1:02:06] Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I've
[1:02:09] suffered the loss of all things, and to
[1:02:11] count them but dung that I may win
[1:02:13] Christ and be found in him.
[1:02:17] Where do you want to be found?"
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; When your name is called, when your time
[1:02:22] comes, where do you want to be found?
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you want to be found caught up
[1:02:26] in your own ideas? Do you want to be
[1:02:29] found caught up in your own dreams,
[1:02:30] caught up in your own ambitions? Or when
[1:02:33] the Lord calls your name, do you want to
[1:02:35] be found in him?
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to be found in Christ.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; I want to be found when someone looks
[1:02:44] for me. Where where can I find brother
[1:02:46] Stephen? You can find him in Christ.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Put your name in there.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Let us be found. That was Paul's desire.
[1:02:55] Oh, that I might be found in him, not
[1:02:59] having my own righteousness.
[1:03:02] You know, we we we sometimes struggle
[1:03:04] with that when we've been in the message
[1:03:06] for a while and and and God has molded
[1:03:08] our lives and and God has washed the
[1:03:11] world out of our lives and and God
[1:03:13] changed our desires and God changed who
[1:03:16] we were and transformed our lives into
[1:03:19] what we are today. The devil likes to
[1:03:22] come on sit on on our shoulder and say,
[1:03:24] "Oh my, you've got it figured out. My
[1:03:27] look at brother so and so. It's too bad
[1:03:29] he doesn't have it figured out. Look at
[1:03:31] sister so if only they could live like
[1:03:34] you.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't you that got that way. It
[1:03:38] was Christ that came into your life.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; It was Christ that changed you. It was
[1:03:43] Christ that blessed you. It was Christ
[1:03:46] that molded you and brought you to the
[1:03:48] place that you are today. It wasn't
[1:03:50] anything to do with you, but it was all
[1:03:52] him working on your life.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; So, let us be like Paul and let that be
[1:04:01] our desire that we might be found in him
[1:04:04] not having our own righteousness,
[1:04:08] not coming to a place where we think,
[1:04:10] "Ah, I've now I'm a believer. If
[1:04:13] anybody's a believer, they can just look
[1:04:15] at me. I'm a real example." like the
[1:04:18] Pharisee in the temple that Jesus saw
[1:04:20] praying and oh I thank thee Lord that
[1:04:23] I'm not like this publican
[1:04:26] and then there was the publican smiting
[1:04:29] his breast saying oh Lord forgive me I'm
[1:04:31] a sinner Jesus said that man went home
[1:04:34] justified let us not be like the
[1:04:36] Pharisee but let us be like the publican
[1:04:39] recognizing and never forgetting where
[1:04:41] we came from and who made us into the
[1:04:44] person that we are today that it's not
[1:04:46] our own righteous iousness, but it's his
[1:04:49] righteousness.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Not having my own righteousness, which
[1:04:53] is of the law, but that which is through
[1:04:56] the faith of Christ,
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; the righteousness which is of God by
[1:05:01] faith.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Let us be found in him. The message
[1:05:06] perfect faith, brother Brandham says. So
[1:05:08] when a man lives by faith and walks by
[1:05:12] faith, I mean substance faith, he is
[1:05:15] isolated from the entire world and
[1:05:18] becomes a new creature in Christ.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; My we think when we get perfect faith,
[1:05:26] when we get sub, then the world is going
[1:05:29] to see who we are.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Then we're really going to stand out.
[1:05:33] then we're going to show everybody the
[1:05:35] power of God.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; But no, Brother Brandham says when
[1:05:38] you're walking by faith, you're isolated
[1:05:41] from the entire world.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; This is not about everybody else. This
[1:05:47] is about you and God alone.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; This is about a personal relationship.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; He's isolated from the entire world and
[1:05:56] becomes a new creature in Christ. there.
[1:06:00] Now you're getting into bride material.
[1:06:03] See? Amen. Isn't that the day that we're
[1:06:05] living in?
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; This is what we're looking towards. This
[1:06:08] is what we're hungering for. This is
[1:06:11] where we want to get to. This is where
[1:06:14] the word is bringing us to.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; The bride age, the uniting time.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; When the word and the bride become one.
[1:06:23] Amen.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; It says when you're walking by substance
[1:06:28] faith now you're getting into bride
[1:06:30] material. See you're getting into
[1:06:32] rapturing condition. Now
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; that means for each one of us so we
[1:06:37] don't put it off to anybody else.
[1:06:39] Brother Brham says that means for each
[1:06:41] one of us
[1:06:43] not just the pastor deacons trustees.
[1:06:47] The pastor is not going to bring us into
[1:06:49] a rapture. The pastor is not going to
[1:06:52] change our mortal bodies.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; But no, it's it's our relationship with
[1:06:57] God. It's that personal walk. It's you
[1:07:00] getting What was the third poll? It was
[1:07:02] that little room
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; where each individual went in by
[1:07:07] themselves. A personal meeting with that
[1:07:10] pillar of fire in that room coming out
[1:07:12] the other side. What happened in there?
[1:07:14] I don't know what happened, but I'm not
[1:07:17] the same person that I was when I went
[1:07:20] in there.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; That's the third pole is a personal
[1:07:24] relationship between you and God alone.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Shut away, isolated from the entire
[1:07:30] world. Brother Brandham says
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; so it's it's not just the pastor,
[1:07:36] deacons, trustees. That means for the
[1:07:39] leoty.
[1:07:40] This is the message that you believe.
[1:07:43] Every individual walks in a world with
[1:07:47] God alone.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Are you ready to accept that?
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Are you ready to be alone with God?
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Bible says it's a fearful thing to fall
[1:08:02] into the hands of the Lord.
[1:08:04] Are you ready to fall into the hands of
[1:08:06] God? Are you ready to place your trust
[1:08:09] completely in him?
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Where it's not you and mom and dad and
[1:08:14] God.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; It's not you and your wife and God.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; It's you and God alone.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; There's nobody to hold your hand. But
[1:08:22] God
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; wants to be known to you.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; He wants to hold your hand.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; He wants to be your guide.
[1:08:31] Bible says in Psalms 23, "The Lord is my
[1:08:34] shepherd.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; I shall not want."
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; You're baptized into this kingdom and
[1:08:43] there's nobody in there but you and God.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; My what a place.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; He gives the orders and you pack them
[1:08:57] out.
[1:08:58] Whatever he says, there's not a shadow
[1:09:01] of doubt nowhere.
[1:09:04] You walk right on. If the Lord says
[1:09:07] this, there's nobody in the world can
[1:09:10] talk you out of it.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; You go right on just the same.
[1:09:16] Now, you're coming into perfect faith.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Perfect perfection that cannot fail.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; That faith never fails.
[1:09:28] Yes, he was a mystic to them with his
[1:09:30] perfect faith. And so it is now with
[1:09:33] those who have perfect faith are a
[1:09:36] mystic to others.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; In him,
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; let us be found in him.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 1 and verse 5 says this. It
[1:09:48] says, "Having predestinated us unto the
[1:09:52] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:09:55] himself
[1:09:58] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:10:00] will."
[1:10:02] This was the good pleasure of his will.
[1:10:04] It wasn't something that somebody forced
[1:10:06] him to do. It wasn't something that that
[1:10:09] well, all right, they've they've
[1:10:11] worshiped hard enough. They've they've
[1:10:13] pressed in. They've sacrificed enough.
[1:10:15] They've they they've done it. No, but it
[1:10:18] was the good pleasure of his will.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; You were in the thoughts of God before
[1:10:23] the foundation of the world.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; And it was the good pleasure of his will
[1:10:30] to bring you into Jesus Christ
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; to predestinate you unto the adoption of
[1:10:37] children.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Predestinated. When he was thinking
[1:10:40] about you before the foundation of the
[1:10:42] world, what did he think about you? He
[1:10:45] thought, "They're going to come to the
[1:10:46] adoption. They're going to come to the
[1:10:48] maturity. I'm going to have children,
[1:10:51] and they're not going to just be babies,
[1:10:53] but they're going to grow up and and
[1:10:55] they're going to become mature
[1:10:57] believers. They're going to reach
[1:10:59] maturity. They're going to reach a place
[1:11:01] where they have absolute confidence in
[1:11:03] my word. They're going to reach a place
[1:11:05] where nothing can shake them. They're
[1:11:07] going to be reach a place where they're
[1:11:09] just like me. As a matter of fact, I'm
[1:11:12] going to put my spirit within them." and
[1:11:14] and and their my spirit is going to bear
[1:11:17] record with their spirit that they are
[1:11:18] the sons of God.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; And there's going to be a cry within
[1:11:22] them that cries out, "Aba, Father."
[1:11:24] They're going to have a desire to be
[1:11:26] just like me because they're my
[1:11:28] children. They're my sons and my
[1:11:30] daughters.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; They're going to grow up and they're
[1:11:32] going to be just like me.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; They don't have a choice
[1:11:38] because they are mine. They are my seed.
[1:11:42] And when that seed begins to manifest,
[1:11:45] it's going to manifest me.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; You know, our our children, they don't
[1:11:52] have a choice.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; When they're born, they're our children.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; When they're babies, we see a little bit
[1:12:02] of mom in there. We see a little bit of
[1:12:04] dad in there. and and and you know,
[1:12:07] somebody sees a little bit of grandpa or
[1:12:09] a little bit of grandma or whatever, but
[1:12:12] you know, they're just a baby. They're
[1:12:14] just a little little baby. They can't
[1:12:16] all they can do is cry and scream and
[1:12:19] and and and and uh laugh and make happy
[1:12:24] noises.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; They can't really communicate,
[1:12:28] but they're are our child
[1:12:30] and we love them. There's there's an
[1:12:32] attachment. They are an expression of
[1:12:35] us.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; But they have not yet manifested their
[1:12:40] potentials.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; They've not yet reached the maturity. We
[1:12:43] can't We don't take that baby and and
[1:12:46] set them set them in the workplace and
[1:12:48] say, "All right, now you go build those
[1:12:51] houses like I build those houses.
[1:12:54] You go fix those IT problems like I fix
[1:12:57] those IT problems." Come on. What's your
[1:12:59] problem? It's just a baby. It just needs
[1:13:01] to be fed. But the so one day they're
[1:13:04] going to be just like their father.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; The only thing that can keep them from
[1:13:10] being like their father is if they don't
[1:13:13] eat.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; If they don't eat, they're going to
[1:13:16] perish. If they don't eat, they're going
[1:13:18] to die.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; But as long as they eat, that which is
[1:13:22] inside of them will be manifested on the
[1:13:24] outside. They will continue to grow.
[1:13:27] They will continue to learn until one
[1:13:29] day they're just like their father.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; And so is it with sons and daughters of
[1:13:35] God. When you've been born again by the
[1:13:38] word of God, the seed of God has been
[1:13:40] quickened in your heart.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; You're just a baby. You don't understand
[1:13:45] exactly who you are. You don't ex
[1:13:47] understand exactly where you're going,
[1:13:50] exactly what your place is in Christ.
[1:13:52] You don't understand what the adoption
[1:13:54] means. You don't understand the placing
[1:13:57] of sons, but you know that that's your
[1:13:59] father and you're his child. There's
[1:14:03] something within you that cries out,
[1:14:04] "Aba, Father." No matter how big of
[1:14:07] mistakes you make, no matter how many
[1:14:09] times you backslid, there's something in
[1:14:11] your heart that brings you back to God,
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; saying, "Lord, there's something crying
[1:14:17] out within me."
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; What is it? It's a sieging of God that's
[1:14:21] been quickened by the spirit of God.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; And now, as long as you feed upon the
[1:14:29] word of God, you will become just like
[1:14:32] him.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; But if you refuse to eat, you will die.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; So that's why it's so important that we
[1:14:41] feed, that we read our Bibles, that we
[1:14:44] pray every day, that we feed upon the
[1:14:46] message of the hour, which is Christ
[1:14:49] revealed in your day.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:53] It's
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; because without that you cannot become
[1:14:58] who you were meant to be.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; You cannot manifest that which is inside
[1:15:03] of you.
[1:15:11] He has predestinated us unto the
[1:15:14] adoption of children
[1:15:16] by Jesus Christ to himself according to
[1:15:20] the good pleasure of his will to the
[1:15:23] praise of the glory of his grace
[1:15:29] wherein he has made us accepted
[1:15:33] in the beloved.
[1:15:38] in the beloved.
[1:15:40] Not accepted because of the beloved,
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; but you are accepted in the beloved.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; You are accepted through Jesus Christ.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; You are accepted when you come into him.
[1:15:53] As long as you stay out living by your
[1:15:55] own works, by your own ideas, by your
[1:15:58] own righteousness,
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; our righteousness is as filthy rags
[1:16:03] before him. It's unacceptable. We are
[1:16:06] unable to achieve a place. We are born
[1:16:09] in sin. We are shaped in iniquity. We
[1:16:11] come in the world speaking lies. We are
[1:16:14] unable right from our birth. We we we
[1:16:17] are born in sin and and unable therefore
[1:16:19] to come into his presence.
[1:16:22] There is only one way to come into his
[1:16:24] presence and that is through the blood
[1:16:27] of Jesus Christ.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; But now when you come into Christ, you
[1:16:31] receive him and you're born again by the
[1:16:34] spirit of God. You've come into Christ
[1:16:36] and now you are accepted because you are
[1:16:40] in the beloved
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; in whom we have redemption through his
[1:16:49] blood.
[1:16:51] in whom.
[1:16:53] Not just because you you believed, oh, I
[1:16:57] believe the message is true.
[1:16:59] Oh, I I believe that's right. I believe
[1:17:02] what those people say is is is right and
[1:17:05] and true. I believe that's the Bible. I
[1:17:08] believe that's we're living in the end
[1:17:10] time. I believe that there's going to be
[1:17:12] a rapture. I believe there's going to be
[1:17:15] But have you received him? That's right.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; You can believe the message. The Bible
[1:17:21] says the the devils believe and tremble.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; So you can believe that the message is
[1:17:28] true. But have you received the message?
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Because it's as many as received him.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; To them gave he power to become the sons
[1:17:37] of God.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Even as many who who as who believe on
[1:17:42] his name.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; So yes, you must believe. But now that
[1:17:47] you have believed, have you received?
[1:17:49] What did Paul say? Have you received the
[1:17:51] Holy Ghost since you believed?
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Have you received him?
[1:17:57] Oh, have you come into him?
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Because only in him are you accepted.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; In him was life. John 1 vers4 in him was
[1:18:18] life and the life was the light of men.
[1:18:22] Not being near him,
[1:18:24] not listening to the word, but in him
[1:18:27] was life.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Let us get in there.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Let us get where there's life. Not just
[1:18:35] around the message. That's not where
[1:18:38] where life is. That's not where the new
[1:18:40] birth is. Not just going to the right
[1:18:42] church. Not just dressing the right way.
[1:18:44] Not just saying the right things, but
[1:18:46] when you come into him, that's where
[1:18:49] there's life.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; That's where there's quickening power.
[1:18:57] John 14:20, Jesus says, "At that day,
[1:19:00] you shall know that I am in my father
[1:19:05] and you are in me."
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; And I am in you. Amen.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; At that day, at in this day, the day
[1:19:13] when he was revealing himself, the day
[1:19:15] when when when he's quickening who he
[1:19:18] is, when he's unveiling, then you won't
[1:19:20] just know who I am, but you'll know who
[1:19:23] you are.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; At that day, you'll know that that I'm
[1:19:26] in the Father and that you are in me.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Revelations 19
[1:19:44] verse 7 says, "Let us be glad and
[1:19:47] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[1:19:50] marriage of the lamb is come." bride
[1:19:54] time.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham spoke about perfect
[1:19:58] faith. When you're walking with
[1:19:59] substance faith, that's bride material.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; The marriage of the lamb has come and
[1:20:07] his wife has made herself ready.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; How did she make herself ready?
[1:20:15] Did Did she Was it her own
[1:20:17] righteousness? Was it her own robes? Was
[1:20:19] it her own her own ability to to to put
[1:20:23] together something? No. It says to her
[1:20:27] was granted
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; that she should be arrayed in fine
[1:20:32] linen,
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; clean and white.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; For the fine linen is the righteousness
[1:20:38] of the saints.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; This righteousness didn't come by her
[1:20:42] own self, but it was given to her.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; To her was granted to her was given
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; to to put on this righteousness, to put
[1:20:52] on this pure linen, clean and white.
[1:20:54] Amen.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; To her was granted.
[1:20:58] The Bible says, "He hath made him to be
[1:21:02] sin for us who knew no sin, that we
[1:21:06] might be made the righteousness of God
[1:21:11] in him."
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Everything is in him.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; That's what we were singing about in the
[1:21:17] song service. It's all in Christ.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; He is everything.
[1:21:24] you know, we want to we want to leave
[1:21:26] behind a legacy. You know, I've been
[1:21:29] I've been working in an old folks home
[1:21:30] the last few weeks and and and it kind
[1:21:34] of gives you a different perspective on
[1:21:36] life
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; and and you see all these elders that
[1:21:41] are that are in their last few years
[1:21:45] living out their final days on earth
[1:21:49] and they all have their names on the on
[1:21:52] their doors.
[1:21:54] But who are these people? Yeah.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; No doubt in their youth, no doubt when
[1:21:59] they were young, they they they had
[1:22:01] jobs. They had families.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; They were part of something. They they
[1:22:06] they were important in their circle.
[1:22:09] They they were they were crucial to to
[1:22:12] the role that that they played to the
[1:22:14] organization or the family they were
[1:22:16] part of. They were they were critical to
[1:22:18] that. But now here they are tucked away
[1:22:21] in this home where you wonder who were
[1:22:25] these people.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; What did they do?
[1:22:29] We may never know.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; We may never hear their names again.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; They maybe they've already been
[1:22:34] forgotten at work.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Some of them already forgotten by their
[1:22:38] own families.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Nobody visits them. Just there all
[1:22:43] alone.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; What do you want to leave behind you?
[1:22:49] You're here today. The Bible says our
[1:22:51] life is but a vapor.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Here today and gone tomorrow.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; We might we we become so important in
[1:23:00] our own eyes.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; We think nobody can do without me. My
[1:23:04] family can't make it without me.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; One day they'll have to make it without
[1:23:09] you.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; My workplace can't make it without me.
[1:23:14] One day they're going to have to make it
[1:23:16] without you.
[1:23:17] That's right.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; One day your family's going to forget
[1:23:20] about you.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Maybe not your children, but maybe your
[1:23:24] children's children, maybe their
[1:23:26] children. They won't even know their
[1:23:28] great grandparents name. They won't even
[1:23:30] they won't even the the workplace, you
[1:23:32] know, as as as employees change over and
[1:23:35] management changes soon, you know,
[1:23:37] somebody will come, hey, did you know so
[1:23:39] and so? No, never never heard of them.
[1:23:42] That was before my time.
[1:23:46] So what do we leave behind us?
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; We have no matter how important we can
[1:23:51] become. You know, even think about
[1:23:53] presidents of the United States. How
[1:23:56] many here can name all of the presidents
[1:23:59] of the United States? I know I certainly
[1:24:02] can't.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; You know, you can remember George
[1:24:04] Washington. You can remember Abraham
[1:24:06] Lincoln. Why? Because they're written
[1:24:07] all over pages of history. But many of
[1:24:10] them were either had short terms or or
[1:24:13] you know they just didn't do nothing
[1:24:16] drastic happened during their during
[1:24:18] their uh um time their term. Thank you.
[1:24:22] And and so so you forget about them.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; And somebody asks you, "Do you know who
[1:24:28] this is?" No, never heard that name. Oh,
[1:24:31] they were a president of the United
[1:24:33] States. So it doesn't matter how
[1:24:35] important we think we are. One day we
[1:24:39] become forgotten.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; You know, we can probably name more
[1:24:43] presidents of the United States than we
[1:24:44] can prime ministers of Canada.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; You know, we are so easily forgotten no
[1:24:50] matter what position we hold, no matter
[1:24:52] what place we hold. So what do we want
[1:24:55] to leave behind us?
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; What is it that we want to share to
[1:25:00] others? What good is it if we try to
[1:25:02] share oursel with somebody? It's here
[1:25:05] today and gone tomorrow. But if we can
[1:25:09] share Jesus Christ with somebody,
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; that is something that is eternal.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; That is something that will never be
[1:25:17] lost to time.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; That is something that will never be
[1:25:20] forgotten. Amen.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Here we are thousands of years later,
[1:25:26] 2,000 years after the death of Christ,
[1:25:30] and we still know him.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he is the same
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; yesterday, today, and forever. He will
[1:25:39] not be forgotten upon the pages of a
[1:25:41] history book.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; He will not be forgotten somewhere down
[1:25:44] on a family tree. But he is the same
[1:25:47] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:25:50] So if you want to leave something
[1:25:51] lasting, excuse me, something lasting in
[1:25:54] your family, leave Jesus Christ in your
[1:25:57] family.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; You want to leave something lasting on
[1:26:01] your job, leave Jesus Christ on your
[1:26:04] job.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; You want to leave something lasting in
[1:26:07] your school, take Jesus Christ into your
[1:26:10] school with you.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; He's the one that will not be forgotten.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:19] He hath made him to be sin for us who
[1:26:21] knew no sin that we might be made the
[1:26:24] righteousness of God in him.
[1:26:30] Brother Brandham says
[1:26:32] in the present stage of my ministry he
[1:26:34] says I hope he will crown my ministry of
[1:26:37] this
[1:26:39] of letting me take the close of the
[1:26:41] word.
[1:26:43] Now here we see Revelations 19 coming
[1:26:46] into manifestation.
[1:26:49] Let that he would let me take the
[1:26:51] clothes of the word and dress his bride
[1:26:54] in the clo in the cloth of the word and
[1:26:58] for his righteousness.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; That was brother Brandham's desire when
[1:27:03] when when he cried out to the Lord,
[1:27:05] Lord, what what do you want me to do? as
[1:27:07] he was having those dreams that he was
[1:27:09] he was sherking his job at at the the
[1:27:11] the hydro company. It wasn't hydro but
[1:27:14] at the power company and he was sherking
[1:27:16] his job at at this other place and he
[1:27:18] said, "Lord, what what am I doing?" And
[1:27:20] he tried to make that right. Is there
[1:27:22] anything that I that I that I did wrong
[1:27:24] and go to his bosses and try to find out
[1:27:27] if there was something wrong? And then
[1:27:30] then it came to him, well, maybe I've
[1:27:33] been sherking on the Lord's job. and he
[1:27:36] picked up his Bible and opened the
[1:27:38] scripture and and and he found his
[1:27:40] place. The scriptures open and there he
[1:27:43] began to read about Eleazar going to get
[1:27:46] a bride for Isaac.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; And he recognized that that's his place.
[1:27:52] That's what God had called him to do was
[1:27:54] to go and hunt a bride for Christ.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; And so he began to lay in the word. He
[1:28:00] began to to preach those messages that
[1:28:03] he'd been hesitant to preach in other
[1:28:05] places and began to to to lay out this
[1:28:08] word that would call the bride. But not
[1:28:11] just call the bride, but that would
[1:28:13] clothe the bride.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; For we are not clothed in our own
[1:28:19] righteousness, but we are clothed in his
[1:28:22] righteousness.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; I want to go back to that quote that we
[1:28:27] read from perfect faith.
[1:28:31] and read it to you once again
[1:28:34] now that we've come to this place in our
[1:28:36] minds.
[1:28:38] When a man lives by faith and walks by
[1:28:41] faith, I mean substance faith, he is
[1:28:45] isolated from the entire world and
[1:28:47] becomes a new creature in Christ.
[1:28:50] There now you're getting into bride
[1:28:53] material.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; What's your faith in? Your faith is in
[1:29:00] the word of God.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; You can't have perfect faith in a man's
[1:29:05] idea because man's ideas will fail.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; You can't have perfect faith in a system
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; because heavens and earth will pass away
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; but my word shall never fail.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; So when you begin to walk by substance
[1:29:21] faith, you're you're not walking by
[1:29:23] faith in an idea in a concept. You're
[1:29:25] walking by faith in the word of God.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; And we're feeding upon the unfailing
[1:29:31] body word of the son of man. That's
[1:29:33] familiar familiar quote to us all.
[1:29:36] Feeding upon the unfailing body word of
[1:29:38] the son of man. So so as we feed upon
[1:29:41] the word of God, that's what's building
[1:29:43] our faith. Faith comes by hearing.
[1:29:46] Hearing by the word of God.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so as as now the word as we
[1:29:53] become united with the word, as the word
[1:29:58] begins to fill our hearts, as the word
[1:30:00] begins to fill every fiber of our being,
[1:30:04] that's what's bringing us to a place of
[1:30:07] substance faith. That's what's bringing
[1:30:09] us to a place of perfect faith is when
[1:30:11] we become one with the word.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; That's what brings us into bride
[1:30:16] material.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; That's a relationship. bride and
[1:30:20] bridegroom is a relationship,
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; a re an intimate relationship of union.
[1:30:26] When you come into a union with the
[1:30:28] word,
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; an inseparable union, the Bible says,
[1:30:33] "What God hath joined together, let no
[1:30:36] man put us under."
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; You come to this place of union.
[1:30:40] Husbands, love your wives even as Christ
[1:30:42] loved the church and gave himself for
[1:30:45] her.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; That's right. So when you come to this
[1:30:50] place of union with the word, a place
[1:30:53] where you in the word are in such a
[1:30:55] relationship that you have an absolute
[1:30:58] confidence in the word
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; that he will not fail.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Before you come into relationship, you
[1:31:09] can you you we many times just think of
[1:31:11] the word as well the word we're just
[1:31:14] speaking of the Bible. We're just
[1:31:16] speaking of of what you read on the on
[1:31:18] of the scriptures of these pages. But
[1:31:21] when you come into relationship with the
[1:31:23] word, you recognize that the word is is
[1:31:26] not just writings upon a page, but the
[1:31:28] word is a person.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; The word is an individual. In the
[1:31:34] beginning was the word, not this Bible,
[1:31:37] but in the beginning was the word and
[1:31:39] the word was with God and the word was
[1:31:41] God. And that word became flesh.
[1:31:47] All that was written and prophesied of
[1:31:50] in here became flesh
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; and dwelt among us.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; So when you come into a place of union,
[1:32:01] a place of relationship with the word so
[1:32:04] intimate that you now become inseparable
[1:32:08] because you have become wed together.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Now that's bride material. That's
[1:32:14] substance faith
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; is when you become inseparable from the
[1:32:20] word.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in one place he
[1:32:25] says it was I and my father are one back
[1:32:27] there and it's I and my father are one
[1:32:30] here.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; You've got to become one with the word.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; You it's got to come off of the these
[1:32:39] pages and into your heart.
[1:32:42] Hallelujah.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; You're in rapturing condition. Each one
[1:32:50] of us, the leoty, every individual
[1:32:54] walking in a world with God alone
[1:32:57] baptized into this kingdom. Nobody in
[1:32:59] there but you and God. He gives the
[1:33:01] orders and you pack them out.
[1:33:05] Whatever he says, [snorts] this is now
[1:33:08] your husband because your bride material
[1:33:10] when you come to this place. Whatever he
[1:33:13] says, whatever your Lord says,
[1:33:17] there's nothing. He says, whatever he
[1:33:20] says, there's not a shadow of doubt
[1:33:23] anywhere.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Why? because you know who said it
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; more than just it was written on the
[1:33:32] pages of this book this book but I know
[1:33:35] the one who wrote it on the pages of
[1:33:38] this book I know the one that spoken in
[1:33:41] this day I know the one that is speaking
[1:33:44] to me today
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; if the Lord says this there's Nobody in
[1:33:56] the world can talk you out of it.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's a husband and wife
[1:34:02] relationship.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; They don't care what the wife doesn't
[1:34:06] care what other people's husbands have
[1:34:09] to say about her.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; She only cares what her husband has to
[1:34:13] say. [cheering]
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; The bride doesn't care what other
[1:34:17] husbands have to say. She doesn't care
[1:34:20] what the devil says about her. She
[1:34:23] doesn't care what the doctors say about
[1:34:25] her. She doesn't care what what the
[1:34:28] banker says about her. She doesn't care
[1:34:30] what what anybody says about She only
[1:34:33] cares what her Lord says about her.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; And her Lord says she is a spotless
[1:34:41] virtuous bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; The the question is, have we recognized
[1:34:50] who we are?
[1:34:52] When you recognize that you are the
[1:34:54] bride of Jesus Christ, then you will
[1:34:57] stop taking what these others tried to
[1:35:00] plant in your mind.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Others that knew you before you were
[1:35:05] saved. Oh no, I know you. I know the way
[1:35:08] you used to drink. I know the way you
[1:35:09] used to run around. I know the way you
[1:35:12] used to live. But that's not me anymore.
[1:35:15] you you no longer care what they have to
[1:35:18] say about you because now you are
[1:35:20] married to the word
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; and he is the only one that is
[1:35:24] important. His is the only opinion that
[1:35:29] you care
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; and when you go to that's when you come
[1:35:33] to a place where circumstances
[1:35:36] become irrelevant.
[1:35:40] Hallelujah.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; That's when you go to a place where no
[1:35:43] matter what the doctor says, the word
[1:35:46] says, "By his stripes, I'm healed."
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; It might not look like it. It might not
[1:35:52] feel like it.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; You might not know when it's going to
[1:35:56] happen, but the word says, "By his
[1:35:58] stripes, I am healed."
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; The word says he's my deliverer.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; I might not know when this this issue is
[1:36:08] going to get out of my life. I might not
[1:36:10] know when I'm going to overcome this
[1:36:12] problem. I might not know when I'm going
[1:36:14] to overcome this desire. But he is my
[1:36:17] deliverer.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Therefore, deliverance has to come
[1:36:21] because the word said so.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, you'll always have this problem. It
[1:36:27] runs in your family. It doesn't matter
[1:36:29] if it runs in the family. The word says
[1:36:32] I am free. [cheering]
[1:36:35] [applause]
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Now you're coming to perfect faith.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Perfect perfection that can't fail.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; What is it? It's not you getting to a
[1:36:50] place of strength. It's you getting to a
[1:36:52] place of weakness
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; where
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; you have no confidence in this flesh.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; But all of your confidence now rests in
[1:37:03] Jesus Christ.
[1:37:06] That's a place of perfection.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Paul says,
[1:37:11] "Not as though I had already attained,
[1:37:14] either were already perfect, but I
[1:37:17] follow after if that I may apprehend
[1:37:20] that for which I which also I am
[1:37:22] apprehended of Christ."
[1:37:26] Brethren, I count on myself to have
[1:37:27] apprehended. But this one thing I do,
[1:37:29] forgetting those things which are
[1:37:30] behind, and reaching forth unto those
[1:37:33] things which are before, I press towards
[1:37:36] the mark for the prize of the high
[1:37:38] calling of God in Christ Jesus. [snorts]
[1:37:42] Let us therefore as many as be perfect
[1:37:46] be thus minded.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Perfect means completeness.
[1:37:57] or maturity.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; That's what the word perfect means.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Can look it up in the Bible, reference
[1:38:05] it to Strong's concordance,
[1:38:08] completeness, maturity.
[1:38:13] More confidence in the word, less
[1:38:16] confidence in the flesh.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; I love this scripture. Paul says in
[1:38:21] Philippians 3:3, he says, "For we are,"
[1:38:25] this is the same chapter. a little
[1:38:27] further back. We are the circumcision.
[1:38:33] So those He's not talking about natural
[1:38:35] circumcision. He's talking about the new
[1:38:37] birth.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; We are the circumcision which worship
[1:38:43] God in the spirit and rejoice in Christ
[1:38:48] Jesus
[1:38:49] and have no confidence in the flesh.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; But you would think that, well, once I
[1:38:57] was born again and once I've been
[1:38:59] walking this way for a long time, now
[1:39:02] I've gotten to a place where I can do
[1:39:04] it.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; But no, we know that that the the new
[1:39:09] birth is the personal revelation of
[1:39:12] Jesus Christ to you.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; And so now Paul is saying we are the new
[1:39:17] birth who are rejoicing in Christ Jesus.
[1:39:20] Amen.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; We've received a personal revelation of
[1:39:25] Jesus Christ to us. We're rejoicing in
[1:39:27] him. We recognize who he is. We
[1:39:30] recognize what he's done for us. And
[1:39:32] what does it do? It causes us to worship
[1:39:35] God in the spirit.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Not just in the flesh realm, not just
[1:39:40] because it feels good, but but because
[1:39:44] we have recognized who he is.
[1:39:47] But another
[1:39:50] evidence Paul is saying
[1:39:52] that you've that you've been quickened.
[1:39:55] Another evidence Paul is saying is that
[1:39:58] you have no confidence in the flesh.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; My We don't like to think about that.
[1:40:08] We like to think, well, when I really
[1:40:09] got it, I won't make mistakes anymore.
[1:40:12] But Paul's saying, when you really got
[1:40:14] it, you won't have no more confidence in
[1:40:16] this flesh.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; When you really got it, you'll recognize
[1:40:20] where this flesh come from. You'll
[1:40:22] recognize that you were born in sin,
[1:40:24] shaped in iniquity, come in the world,
[1:40:26] speaking lies. You'll recognize that
[1:40:28] it's by grace that you're saved, not of
[1:40:31] works, lest any man should boast. You'll
[1:40:33] recognize that he won't share his glory
[1:40:36] with any man, but he wants to express
[1:40:39] his glory through your life. Amen.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; The glory of Jesus Christ.
[1:40:47] So as we come to this place of maturity,
[1:40:50] we come to a place where we have more
[1:40:52] confidence in the word, less confidence
[1:40:55] in oursel.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham in perfect faith. He's
[1:41:00] he's reading from the scripture. He says
[1:41:05] he says, "Therefore," and this is where
[1:41:06] I want to get to this morning. He says,
[1:41:08] "Therefore I say unto you,
[1:41:12] what things soever you desire when you
[1:41:15] pray, believe that you receive them
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; and you shall have them." Oh, this is
[1:41:20] the place we want to get to where we
[1:41:23] just we can just ask and we know it's
[1:41:25] going to happen.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; We love those scriptures and we we love
[1:41:30] to claim those promises. Lord, you said
[1:41:31] if I ask anything, you said wherever two
[1:41:34] or three would agree on anything. Lord,
[1:41:36] you you said this. Lord, you said that.
[1:41:38] And Lord, I'm asking.
[1:41:41] We love those promises. Whatsoever you
[1:41:43] desire when you pray, believe that you
[1:41:45] receive them and you shall have them.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; A place of faith, place of perfect
[1:41:51] faith. And when you stand praying,
[1:41:56] forgive. Amen.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; This is a place of maturity.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; Forgiveness is not for children.
[1:42:06] Forgiveness is for a place of maturity.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; When you stand praying, forgive if you
[1:42:14] have ought against any, that your father
[1:42:18] also which is in heaven may forgive you
[1:42:22] of your trespasses.
[1:42:26] When you get to a place where you have
[1:42:29] the kind of faith that you can ask what
[1:42:32] you would and it'll be done unto you
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; in that place, in that maturity, in that
[1:42:38] time. Now, when you come and ask, be
[1:42:42] sure to forgive.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; You're the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:42:51] Now, forgive.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:54] You know who you are and you know how to
[1:42:56] ask for what you need. Now forgive.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; This place of maturity
[1:43:03] where we still have transgressions. We
[1:43:07] still make mistakes.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't say when you get to this
[1:43:11] place now you're at a place where you're
[1:43:14] beyond transgression. Now you're at a
[1:43:16] place where you're you're beyond sin.
[1:43:19] You're beyond mistakes. You're beyond
[1:43:21] faults. No. The Bible says if we confess
[1:43:23] our sins, he is faithful and just to
[1:43:25] forgive us
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; of our sins.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; But when you come to this place now,
[1:43:32] he says when you stand praying, forgive
[1:43:37] if you have ought against any
[1:43:41] that your father also. He doesn't say if
[1:43:44] if somebody has something against you,
[1:43:48] Lord, this one's got something against
[1:43:50] me, Lord, make them come. No, you
[1:43:53] forgive.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; This isn't about them. Remember, this is
[1:43:57] a place of perfect faith where it's you
[1:43:59] and God alone. There's nobody else in
[1:44:02] this room. This is not about them. This
[1:44:04] is about you. He says, "Now when you
[1:44:07] stand praying, when you're shut in with
[1:44:09] God in that secret place and it's just
[1:44:12] you and him alone in this place, now
[1:44:14] when you stand and you begin to commune
[1:44:17] with that one, with your with your
[1:44:19] bridegroom, you begin to commune with
[1:44:21] him. Now forgive.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; If you have ought against any, that your
[1:44:28] father also which is in heaven may
[1:44:30] forgive you of your transgress
[1:44:33] trespasses.
[1:44:36] But if you do not forgive, well, I I
[1:44:39] I'll forgive. I can't forgive right now.
[1:44:40] It was it was too bad. It was it was it
[1:44:43] was too negative. It was too harsh. It
[1:44:45] was too critical. I just I can't I can't
[1:44:48] forgive them right now.
[1:44:52] If you do not forgive, neither will your
[1:44:55] father which is in heaven forgive your
[1:44:59] trans trespasses.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Then he makes this statement. This is a
[1:45:07] quote. Now brother Brandham was reading
[1:45:08] the scriptures and then now he makes
[1:45:10] this statement. Now faith is based on
[1:45:14] forgiveness. That
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; my you come to a place of perfect faith.
[1:45:20] You come to a place where you know who
[1:45:22] you are. You come to a place where you
[1:45:24] are united with the word. That faith is
[1:45:28] based on forgiveness.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; What kind of a people should we be?
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Not a proud people.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Not a not a people that says, "Oh, they
[1:45:38] should listen to me. I'm the bride. I
[1:45:41] got the answers. I know what's
[1:45:42] happening. I I know where we're going. I
[1:45:45] know what's been done. I I know what the
[1:45:47] problem is. No, we should be a humble
[1:45:50] people.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; We should be a people that forgives.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Faith is based on forgiveness. Then
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; one day there was a man walking in
[1:46:04] perfect faith of who he was.
[1:46:08] The man Christ Jesus our Lord.
[1:46:12] He was perfect
[1:46:14] and he had perfect faith. He had perfect
[1:46:17] confidence in what the word says about
[1:46:19] him. He knew who he was. He knew what he
[1:46:22] came for. He knew what he had to do. He
[1:46:25] knew his position. And there as he stood
[1:46:28] on the on the mountain one day and and
[1:46:30] and and the Lord came down and and he
[1:46:33] was arrayed in in white and and Peter
[1:46:36] said, "Oh, here's Moses and Elijah and
[1:46:38] Jesus. Let us make three altars." and
[1:46:41] and and a voice comes down from heaven
[1:46:44] and and cries out, "This is my beloved
[1:46:47] son. Hear ye him.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Here's this one that was perfect. Here's
[1:46:51] this one that was the beloved son.
[1:46:55] This one that walked by substance faith.
[1:46:58] This one that walked knowing who he was
[1:47:00] without a shadow of a doubt.
[1:47:05] And as he hung there upon the cross,
[1:47:11] he said, "Know ye not that I could call
[1:47:13] for 10,000 angels, 10 legions of angels,
[1:47:17] and my father would send them right now?
[1:47:20] Put up your sword.
[1:47:22] This one that held the keys to the power
[1:47:26] of God. This one who was the son of God.
[1:47:31] This one who was the the image of the
[1:47:34] invisible God.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; This one who was God walking in flesh.
[1:47:39] The word became flesh and dwelt among
[1:47:42] us. And as he's walking
[1:47:45] yet so humble
[1:47:47] yet so humble that Satan came down,
[1:47:52] he knew the prophecies. He knew the
[1:47:55] coming son. He knew all of these things
[1:47:58] that were written. But when he came down
[1:48:00] and he saw the one that was fulfilling
[1:48:03] the prophecies, he said, "Can this be
[1:48:05] the one? There's no way that this could
[1:48:08] be the one to fulfill those. There's no
[1:48:10] way that this could be." So he come to
[1:48:12] Jesus and he says, "If thou be the son
[1:48:15] of God."
[1:48:17] What was it? He didn't believe.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; He knew what the word said.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; He knew what had to come. But now as it
[1:48:25] was being fulfilled, he says, "What?
[1:48:28] This is the one.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; This is the almighty God dwelling in
[1:48:33] flesh. This is the one upon whom the
[1:48:36] spirit comes down and remains upon. This
[1:48:39] is the one in whom the fullness of the
[1:48:42] God does dwell.
[1:48:44] If you're really the son of God,
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; turn these stones into bread. If you're
[1:48:49] really the son of God, cast yourself
[1:48:51] down off the temple. If you're really
[1:48:53] the son of God, bow down and worship me
[1:48:55] and I'll give you all the kingdoms of
[1:48:57] the world. Let's make this happen. Let's
[1:49:00] get this ball rolling. Let's see some
[1:49:02] power.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; But the spirit of God doesn't clown for
[1:49:09] the devil. That's right.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; And as the bride begins to be manifest,
[1:49:16] as you begin to be manifest in your day,
[1:49:20] all of creation groaning, crying out in
[1:49:23] expectation for the manifestation of the
[1:49:26] sons of God. And as those sons of God
[1:49:29] begin to be manifested,
[1:49:33] begin to walk out upon the face of the
[1:49:35] earth, begin to get up in the morning
[1:49:38] and stretch and and eat their breakfast
[1:49:41] and go to work, and the devil looks down
[1:49:43] upon your lives and says, "This
[1:49:48] is the one." And he begins to come and
[1:49:51] sit on your shoulder and say, "Well, if
[1:49:53] you're if you're really a son of God,
[1:49:57] Let's see some manifestations. Let's see
[1:50:00] some power.
[1:50:02] Let's see you put some money in that
[1:50:05] empty bank account. If you're really a
[1:50:07] son of God, let's see you overcome that
[1:50:10] sickness. If you're really a son of God,
[1:50:13] let's see you do this. Let's see. And
[1:50:15] and it's a temptation.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; We think, well, and we begin to think
[1:50:21] about those things. Where do those
[1:50:23] thoughts come from? Brother Brandham
[1:50:25] says those your thoughts either come
[1:50:27] from God or they come from the devil.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; So now as there begins to be thoughts
[1:50:32] going through your mind saying, "Well,
[1:50:34] if I'm really a son of God,
[1:50:37] why why do I struggle with this? If I
[1:50:40] was a son of God, surely I would just
[1:50:42] ask and and I would speak it and I would
[1:50:44] walk into perfect health and and and I
[1:50:47] would walk in perfect strength. I would
[1:50:48] have that promotion that I want. I would
[1:50:51] I would have this.
[1:50:52] Where are those thoughts coming from?
[1:50:56] The same one that said to Jesus, "If
[1:50:58] thou be, why don't you do this? Why
[1:51:00] don't you do that? Why don't you show
[1:51:02] me?" But the power of God did not come
[1:51:05] for himself. It came for others.
[1:51:09] That's right.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; So, as he hung there upon the cross,
[1:51:17] fulfilling
[1:51:19] every prophecy that was written about
[1:51:22] him,
[1:51:23] he cried out. What did he cry out? What
[1:51:26] did he cry? Lord, it's done. You can now
[1:51:28] judge the earth.
[1:51:31] Lord, it's done. Destroy. Let fire fall
[1:51:35] from heaven. destroy the temple, destroy
[1:51:38] those priests, destroy those. So no, as
[1:51:40] he hung there upon the cross,
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; at the finishing of his work, at the
[1:51:46] maturity, at the his placing, at his
[1:51:49] coronation day, as as he fulfilled the
[1:51:52] word that was written about him, he
[1:51:55] cried out, "Father,
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; forgive them.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; They don't know what they're doing.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; How should we be any different?" the
[1:52:03] bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:52:07] How could we be any different than our
[1:52:09] bridegroom when we come into
[1:52:12] manifestation? When we begin to
[1:52:14] recognize who we are, when we begin to
[1:52:16] recognize that it's the spirit of God
[1:52:18] working through us and doing these
[1:52:20] mighty works and and and expressing his
[1:52:24] life through out through these unworthy
[1:52:27] vessels,
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; how could we be any different than to
[1:52:30] cry, "Father,
[1:52:33] forgive them."
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; They don't know what they're doing.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:44] wherein he has made us accepted
[1:52:49] in the beloved.
[1:52:53] He was the beloved son and we have been
[1:52:56] accepted in him. We were in him there as
[1:53:00] he hung upon the cross. Amen.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; And now that word that was in him there,
[1:53:06] that attribute as that Holy Ghost now
[1:53:09] broke out upon the upon the the church
[1:53:12] in the upper room and and and and fell
[1:53:15] upon the 120 in the upper room and and
[1:53:18] begin to fall upon upon the others as on
[1:53:20] the day of Pentecost and and as the
[1:53:23] spirit went out and and and Peter said,
[1:53:25] "Repent and be baptized, every one of
[1:53:27] you. You shall receive the gift of the
[1:53:29] Holy Ghost. This promise is to you." And
[1:53:32] it's to your children and to them that
[1:53:33] are far off, even as many as the Lord
[1:53:36] our God shall call.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; You were in him there. And now here you
[1:53:42] are expressed in your day, manifested in
[1:53:45] your day.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Not relying on yourself, not becoming a
[1:53:50] different expression of of something
[1:53:52] different, but the expression of the
[1:53:55] beloved.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; You're in the beloved now. expressing
[1:53:59] him out through your life.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "And it is the
[1:54:11] rising of the sun." It says, "As he
[1:54:13] being the groom, the bride has to come
[1:54:16] forth because it's part of him.
[1:54:20] And it can only be the manifestation
[1:54:25] of the fulfilling of all the revelations
[1:54:30] any others has spoken of the bride.
[1:54:34] What are you going to express? You're
[1:54:36] not going to express your own hopes,
[1:54:38] your own dreams, your own ambitions, but
[1:54:42] you're going to be a manifestation, an
[1:54:45] express, an expression of what the word
[1:54:48] says about you. Amen.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; All that the word says about the bride,
[1:54:53] you are going to express
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; out from your life.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; It's you and him alone.
[1:55:08] So musicians come. Maybe we could sing
[1:55:10] that little song. Shut in with God in a
[1:55:13] secret place.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; It's you and him shut in to this secret
[1:55:18] place. Nothing
[1:55:20] can come between you and him.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; Nothing can separate you from his love.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "What can separate us from
[1:55:36] the love of God?
[1:55:38] Shall tribulations, shall persecutions,
[1:55:42] shall death,
[1:55:45] sickness, sorrows,
[1:55:48] nothing can separate. Why? Because you
[1:55:51] have become inseparable
[1:55:54] from the word of God. You are united
[1:55:57] with him as you feed on this word, as
[1:56:00] you as as you labor to enter in. The
[1:56:03] Bible says the law and the prophets were
[1:56:05] until John. But from that time, every
[1:56:08] man presses into the kingdom of God. And
[1:56:12] as you [music] now press into the word
[1:56:14] of God, you're pressing into a
[1:56:17] relationship,
[1:56:19] you're pressing into a union that you
[1:56:22] and the word might become one.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; This isn't about your family. This isn't
[1:56:28] about trying to be what mom and dad want
[1:56:30] you to be. This isn't about trying to
[1:56:32] impress your brother, your sister, but
[1:56:35] this is about you and God alone.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what they think. It
[1:56:42] matters what God thinks.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean that God's not going
[1:56:48] to speak through them because God uses
[1:56:50] moms and dads and and and and the the
[1:56:53] Bible tells us children obey your
[1:56:55] parents. Tells us to honor our father
[1:56:58] and mother. If you got godly parents,
[1:57:00] what are they doing? They're trying to
[1:57:02] push you to meet Jesus Christ
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; because it's not good enough. It's not
[1:57:08] good enough to know that mom and dad
[1:57:09] know Jesus Christ. That won't bring you
[1:57:11] to heaven. But you have to know Jesus
[1:57:14] Christ. It's not good enough that your
[1:57:16] pastor knows Jesus Christ. It's not good
[1:57:18] enough brother Moses knows Jesus Christ
[1:57:20] or Brother Zigg knows Jesus Christ. It's
[1:57:22] not good enough that the musicians know
[1:57:24] him or the song leader knows him.
[1:57:27] [music]
[1:57:27] But you must know Jesus Christ and you
[1:57:31] must press into him as he begins to
[1:57:34] knock upon your heart. You must press
[1:57:37] in. You must press begin to push
[1:57:39] yourself out of the way.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; Begin to open the doors of your heart.
[1:57:44] Those doors that you won't let anybody
[1:57:47] else inside. Those doors that you won't
[1:57:50] let your brother inside. You won't let
[1:57:51] your sister inside. You won't let your
[1:57:54] wife, your husband inside. You won't let
[1:57:56] anybody know about these things that
[1:57:58] you've been through, but let Jesus
[1:58:00] Christ inside
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; that you can become shut in with him
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; in a secret place.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; He's not going to go telling everybody
[1:58:11] what you told him. But no, he's a
[1:58:14] personal God.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; He cares about you. He'll send ministers
[1:58:19] by your way that will minister directly
[1:58:22] to your heart, directly to that need
[1:58:25] that you have shared with him and him
[1:58:27] alone that nobody else could possibly
[1:58:29] know about.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; In brother Brandham's day, under that
[1:58:32] gift of of discernment, as people would
[1:58:35] come up and he would tell them things
[1:58:37] that nobody else could possibly know
[1:58:39] about,
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; that brother Brandham could not have
[1:58:42] possibly known. But what was it? It was
[1:58:44] Christ expressing to them that I know
[1:58:48] you,
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; that I know your troubles. And and we
[1:58:51] don't have that gift here this morning,
[1:58:53] but we have the same Lord Jesus Christ
[1:58:56] here this morning that knows your
[1:58:58] troubles. And maybe he was speaking to
[1:59:01] you this morning. Maybe he was speaking
[1:59:03] to your heart. Maybe he was speaking to
[1:59:05] your address about your situation, about
[1:59:07] your trouble.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; It's because he cares about you. Amen.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; It's because he wants to increase your
[1:59:16] faith.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; It's because he wants to draw you into
[1:59:19] his presence.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; It's because he wants to meet your need.
[1:59:24] And he doesn't want you to rely upon the
[1:59:26] things of this world that you've been
[1:59:29] relying upon. But he wants you to lay
[1:59:32] those things aside and come into his
[1:59:34] presence [music] and rely upon him and
[1:59:37] him alone that you might come to a place
[1:59:40] of perfect faith,
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; a place of rapturing faith.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; That you might come into bride material
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; that you might be ready
[1:59:51] to step over into a new body
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; to step over into that place. It's it's
[1:59:57] not it's not about the new body.
[2:00:01] It's not about the perfect health.
[2:00:04] It's about being with him forever.
[2:00:10] That shikina glory, that supernatural
[2:00:13] presence that you come in from time to
[2:00:15] time and you say, "Lord,
[2:00:18] don't ever let me leave this place.
[2:00:21] Don't ever let me leave this presence."
[2:00:23] when you come into that place.
[2:00:26] But we have obligations.
[2:00:29] We have things we have to do. We have to
[2:00:31] look after our families.
[2:00:34] We have to we have to go to work. We
[2:00:36] have to and and we go into places and
[2:00:38] the spirit of God that that that
[2:00:40] anointing leaves us and and and we just
[2:00:43] long for that time when we can once
[2:00:45] again get into the presence of God.
[2:00:48] But this is about
[2:00:51] this is about where he can finally take
[2:00:53] us
[2:00:54] to a place where we will never have to
[2:00:57] leave that presence again.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; Where we will never have to leave that
[2:01:01] chakina glory again.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; Where we can ever be with the Lord.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; The Bible says
[2:01:12] comfort one another with these words.
[2:01:15] When Paul talked about
[2:01:18] when he talked about the body change and
[2:01:20] he talked about about the Lord himself
[2:01:23] shall come with a shout and he talked
[2:01:24] about the dead in Christ rising.
[2:01:28] He didn't say
[2:01:30] get excited about these words although
[2:01:32] they do excite us.
[2:01:36] He didn't say rejoice about these words,
[2:01:39] although we do rejoice in them, but he
[2:01:42] said these words will bring comfort,
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; knowing that there's coming a day
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; when we will no longer have to ever
[2:01:54] leave that presence,
[2:01:58] that holy presence, that all knowing
[2:02:00] presence,
[2:02:02] that supernatural presence
[2:02:05] where prayers are met,
[2:02:09] where needs are met, where questions are
[2:02:12] answered forever. When we get on that
[2:02:14] side, we will forever live in that
[2:02:18] presence where every question can be
[2:02:20] answered.
[2:02:22] Where every need will be met. He said
[2:02:24] before they even pray, I will answer
[2:02:28] them.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; That's the place we're coming to. Amen.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; The the sufferings the sufferings of
[2:02:36] this present time are not worthy to be
[2:02:40] compared with the glory that shall be
[2:02:42] revealed in us.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Christ in you the hope of glory. Let's
[2:02:47] stand together.
[2:02:49] Shut in
[2:02:52] with God
[2:02:55] in a secret
[2:02:58] [singing] place.
[2:03:01] There
[2:03:03] in the spirit
[2:03:06] beholding [singing]
[2:03:09] his face, [music]
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; gaining
[2:03:15] no power
[2:03:17] to run
[2:03:19] in the race.
[2:03:22] Oh, I long
[2:03:25] to be shot in with God. Or do you have a
[2:03:31] need this morning? Just reach out to
[2:03:33] him. [singing]
[2:03:36] with God
[2:03:39] in that secret
[2:03:43] place. All he knows
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; there
[2:03:47] in the spirit.
[2:03:51] Behold in his [singing] face,
[2:03:56] gaining
[2:03:58] more power
[2:04:01] to run [music and singing] in the race.
[2:04:06] Oh, I long [singing]
[2:04:09] to be [music] shot in
[2:04:12] with God. Oh, sing it one more time. Oh,
[2:04:17] shining [singing]
[2:04:19] the way [music] of God
[2:04:23] in a secret [singing]
[2:04:26] place.
[2:04:29] There
[2:04:30] in the [singing] spirit,
[2:04:34] behold in his face
[2:04:40] any [singing]
[2:04:42] more power
[2:04:45] to ride [singing and music] in the race.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, I long
[2:04:52] to be [music]
[2:04:53] shouting
[2:04:56] with God.
[2:04:59] Oh, let's sing that song. He is all I
[2:05:01] need. He is all I need. Jesus is all I
[2:05:05] need.
[2:05:08] He is all
[2:05:11] I need.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, is he all you need this [music]
[2:05:14] morning? He's all
[2:05:17] I need.
[2:05:21] Jesus [singing]
[2:05:24] is all
[2:05:26] I
[2:05:28] need.
[2:05:32] Oh, he is all
[2:05:35] I need.
[2:05:38] He is all
[2:05:42] I need.
[2:05:45] Jesus
[2:05:48] is all
[2:05:50] I need.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's sing it to him. You are all I
[2:05:54] need. Oh, you are all
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, can we lift our hands? Oh, you
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; you are all
[2:06:05] I need. [music and singing]
[2:06:08] Yes, Jesus.
[2:06:12] You're all [singing]
[2:06:14] I need. [music]
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; You are all
[2:06:23] I need.
[2:06:25] You
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; You [singing] are all
[2:06:29] I need.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; Jesus, [music and singing]
[2:06:35] you're all
[2:06:37] I need. Oh, I will worship [music] him.
[2:06:42] Yes, I [singing] will worship
[2:06:46] him.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; I will worship
[2:06:53] him.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, his spirit
[2:06:59] and
[2:07:01] truth.
[2:07:05] Oh, I will [singing] worship
[2:07:09] him.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; I will [singing] worship
[2:07:15] him
[2:07:18] in spirit [singing and music]
[2:07:22] and in truth.
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be his name. As we bow our
[2:07:30] heads together, let's just softly sing
[2:07:33] that little chorus. He carth for you. He
[2:07:37] [music] carth for you. With our eyes
[2:07:40] closed and our heads bowed,
[2:07:42] he
[2:07:45] carth
[2:07:46] for [singing] you.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; It's personal this morning.
[2:07:53] He
[2:07:56] car
[2:07:58] for you
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; through
[2:08:06] [music] sunshine [singing]
[2:08:09] or shadows.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; He
[2:08:17] car
[2:08:19] for you. Can you sing? He carth for me.
[2:08:24] Oh, he [music and singing]
[2:08:28] carth for me.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; He knows what you're going through.
[2:08:35] Yes, he [singing]
[2:08:38] car for me [music]
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; through
[2:08:49] sunshine
[2:08:51] or shadows.
[2:08:59] care
[2:09:01] for me.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[2:09:08] Lord, we believe that this morning,
[2:09:11] Lord, that you care for us
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; for you are our bridegroom, Lord. And
[2:09:17] your word says, [music]
[2:09:19] Lord, that husbands should love their
[2:09:21] wives even as you loved the church. Even
[2:09:26] as you loved us and gave yourself for
[2:09:30] us,
[2:09:32] Lord, your word says that you so loved
[2:09:35] the world that you gave your only
[2:09:37] begotten son that whosoever believeth on
[2:09:40] him shall not perish but have
[2:09:43] everlasting life.
[2:09:46] Lord, we believe you this morning. We
[2:09:49] believe your word, Father.
[2:09:52] We believe that you care. We believe
[2:09:53] that you know what we are going through
[2:09:56] this morning. You know the needs that we
[2:09:59] have. Lord, you know if there is any
[2:10:02] sickness in here this morning that
[2:10:04] someone is suffering. You know their
[2:10:06] suffering. You know their pain. Lord,
[2:10:09] maybe there's someone suffering pain in
[2:10:12] their heart this morning. heartaches,
[2:10:14] brokenheartedness, oh God. Lord,
[2:10:17] heartaches that come from the suffering
[2:10:19] and the sorrow that we endure in this
[2:10:22] life. But Lord, you said you said those
[2:10:25] sufferings that we're going through,
[2:10:27] Lord, they're not worthy to be compared
[2:10:29] with the glory that shall be revealed.
[2:10:32] Lord, you said this suffering is but for
[2:10:33] a season.
[2:10:36] a season that it might mold us, that it
[2:10:39] might bring us to perfection, that it
[2:10:42] might bring us to a perfect rest, that
[2:10:45] it might bring us to a comfort in you,
[2:10:47] that it might bring us to a place where
[2:10:49] we have an absolute confidence in you.
[2:10:53] Where Lord, we're no longer relying upon
[2:10:56] oursel. We're no longer rely upon our
[2:10:59] education. we no longer rely upon upon
[2:11:03] our our ideas, upon our bank accounts,
[2:11:06] but that Lord, our confidence rests just
[2:11:09] in you.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; Lord, you're bringing us to a place of
[2:11:13] perfect faith. And Lord, may we just
[2:11:15] rest in that this morning, Lord, knowing
[2:11:18] that Lord, you know the situations.
[2:11:21] Lord, Father, as you stood in the
[2:11:24] church, Lord, in Revelations 2 and you
[2:11:27] you stood and you said, "I know.
[2:11:30] I know your tribulations.
[2:11:33] I know your heartaches. I know your
[2:11:36] suffering.
[2:11:39] Lord Jesus,
[2:11:41] we love you, Lord.
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; And we know that, Lord, though sometimes
[2:11:45] life is hard, we know you said that all
[2:11:48] things will work together for good to
[2:11:50] them who love you, who are called
[2:11:53] according to your purpose. And we pray
[2:11:55] that you would just take every situation
[2:11:58] here this morning under your control,
[2:12:00] Lord. And Father, may we just place it
[2:12:03] in your hands this morning, knowing,
[2:12:06] Lord, that you will look after it, oh
[2:12:08] God. And may we just walk as Abraham
[2:12:10] walked, Lord. May we walk with that kind
[2:12:13] of a faith that Lord, no matter what
[2:12:16] circumstances look like, no matter how
[2:12:19] impossible it looks, you are the God of
[2:12:22] the impossible.
[2:12:25] because nothing is impossible to you,
[2:12:28] Lord. We rest in your promises this
[2:12:31] morning. And we just commit each one to
[2:12:33] your hands. Lord, you see every hand
[2:12:35] that is lifted. You see every need
[2:12:37] that's represented here this morning.
[2:12:39] Maybe some not even asking for
[2:12:41] themselves, but maybe for others that
[2:12:42] are at home or abroad, Lord. Father, you
[2:12:46] know every need, Father. And you are a
[2:12:48] present help in a time of trouble. Lord,
[2:12:51] we just rest in you this morning. And we
[2:12:53] pray that that these few words that were
[2:12:56] spoken here would just lift up our
[2:12:58] confidence and increase our faith
[2:13:01] that you will perform. You will complete
[2:13:05] that which you have started in our
[2:13:07] lives, Lord.
[2:13:10] Blessed be your name. Go with us,
[2:13:12] Father, and be with us. We pray. We just
[2:13:15] [music] rest in you, Lord. In Jesus name
[2:13:17] we pray. Amen.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:21] Amen. I want to turn the service over to
[2:13:24] brother Zigg this morning. Maybe we
[2:13:26] could sing that song. Do you know that
[2:13:28] song? On Christ the solid rock. Of
[2:13:30] course you know that song. On Christ the
[2:13:31] solid rock I stand all other grounds. My
[2:13:35] hope is built on nothing less.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; My hope is built on nothing [singing]
[2:13:43] less than Jesus blood and righteousness.
[2:13:49] I dare not trust the [music] sweetest
[2:13:52] friend [singing]
[2:13:53] but a holy
[2:13:56] on Jesus name.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; On Christ the solid [singing and music]
[2:14:01] rock I stand. All other ground is
[2:14:06] sinking [music] sand.
[2:14:09] All around is sinking sand.
[2:14:14] And darkness seems [music] to hide his
[2:14:18] face. I rest on his unchanging grace.
[2:14:23] [music]
[2:14:24] In every high and stormy he
[2:14:29] anchor [singing] hold within the veil
[2:14:34] on Christ the solid [singing]
[2:14:36] rock I stand. [music] All other ground
[2:14:41] is sinking sand. All other ground is
[2:14:46] sinking [singing] sand.
[2:14:49] His oath is [music] covered in [singing]
[2:14:52] his blood. Support me in the whelming
[2:14:57] flood. And all around my soul gives
[2:15:02] [music and singing] way. Even is all my
[2:15:06] hope is [music and singing]
[2:15:09] the solid
[2:15:11] rock I stand. All other ground is
[2:15:16] sinking [music and singing] sand. All
[2:15:18] other ground is sinking sand.
[2:15:23] When he shall come with trumpet sound,
[2:15:28] oh may I then in [music] him be found
[2:15:34] in his rightousness [singing]
[2:15:36] alone, fought lest to stand before the
[2:15:41] throne.
[2:15:43] On Christ [music] the solid rock I
[2:15:46] stand. All [singing] other ground is
[2:15:50] sinking sand. All other ground is
[2:15:54] [music] sinking sand.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Thank you,
[2:16:01] brother Stephen. Wasn't a good message.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. We got to be in Christ
[2:16:08] in the Holy Spirit. Hallelujah. That's
[2:16:11] our desire. Praise God. That's what the
[2:16:14] message is all about. Christ in you, the
[2:16:16] hope of glory.
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Thank you,
[2:16:20] brother Steve. Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[2:16:23] Amen. Let's say that. Amen. In closing,
[2:16:28] uh, victory is mine, but
[2:16:32] we put the announcements on there just
[2:16:34] real fast.
[2:16:36] Next Sunday, we have brother Gideon. How
[2:16:38] many know brother Gideon?
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's a wonderful minister as well.
[2:16:43] Amen. So, expecting
[2:16:46] great things from the Lord. Amen. I
[2:16:49] believe the Lord has spoken to us this
[2:16:51] morning.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Each one of us individually,
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; we got to be sh with God more and more.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; We got to get back to the basics of the
[2:17:02] message. Find out what the prophet said.
[2:17:05] Amen. And it's renewed every time we
[2:17:08] listen to the message.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Victory is my
[2:17:13] name.
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; Victory is mine.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; Victory is mine.
[2:17:23] Victory today [singing]
[2:17:25] is mine.
[2:17:29] I told Satan [music and singing] to get
[2:17:33] behind.
[2:17:35] Victory today [singing] is mine.
[2:17:40] [music]
[2:17:41] Love is mine.
[2:17:44] Love [singing]
[2:17:45] is mine.
[2:17:47] Love today is [music and singing] mine.
[2:17:53] I told Satan to [music] get behind.
[2:17:59] Love today is mine.
[2:18:05] You are mine.
[2:18:08] Joy is mine.
[2:18:11] Joy [singing]
[2:18:12] today is mine.
[2:18:17] I [singing] told Satan to get [music]
[2:18:20] me
[2:18:22] joy to
[2:18:28] [music and singing]
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; When I woke this morning,
[2:18:31] I didn't have no doubt.
[2:18:34] I knew that the Lord would bring me out.
[2:18:37] [singing]
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; So I got down on my knees. I said,
[2:18:43] [music and singing] "Lord, help me
[2:18:44] please." I got up singing and shouting,
[2:18:48] "Victory,
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; Victory [music] is [singing] mine.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; Victory is mine.
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; Victory [music] today [singing] is mine.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; I told Satan to get behind.
[2:19:08] [singing and music]
[2:19:10] Victory today is mine.
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's victory here this
[2:19:17] morning because of Jesus. Not because of
[2:19:22] our own self, because of the word of God
[2:19:25] that has brought us deliverance. Can you
[2:19:27] say amen?
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Peace is mine.
[2:19:33] Peace is [singing] mine.
[2:19:36] Peace [music] today is mine.
[2:19:42] I told Satan [music and singing]
[2:19:45] to get behind.
[2:19:48] Peace today [singing] is mine. [music]
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Elisha, would you come?
[2:19:59] Amen. I was trying to eye you. Amen. You
[2:20:01] were looking the other way. God bless
[2:20:04] you. Pray in English, will you?
[2:20:09] [laughter]
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; Let us pray.
[2:20:16] Mercy.
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord God of grace and of
[2:20:21] mercy.
[2:20:25] We are thankful for this grace that
[2:20:27] you've given us this morning.
[2:20:30] It's not easy, Father God.
[2:20:34] But by your grace, oh Lord Jesus,
[2:20:37] you've spoken us, Lord,
[2:20:43] showing that you we supposed to be
[2:20:45] there,
[2:20:48] that place that has been prepared for
[2:20:50] us.
[2:20:54] It's a place that I should just be you
[2:20:56] and I. We thank you, Lord Jesus, for
[2:20:58] that.
[2:21:02] We invite your holy name so that he can
[2:21:04] assist us this morning. Lord,
[2:21:09] let this prophetic word that came forth
[2:21:11] this morning, Lord.
[2:21:15] May he be with us wherever we be
[2:21:19] so that he may transform our lives,
[2:21:26] so that we may continue thirsting after
[2:21:28] you, Lord.
[2:21:30] Do not hide your face from us.
[2:21:35] Accept that we may continue to be in
[2:21:37] your presence, Lord. So that
[2:21:42] in your presence there's peace, Lord.
[2:21:47] In your presence, we will have rest.
[2:21:50] Rest from all our iniquities,
[2:21:55] rest from all our weaknesses.
[2:21:58] We can only find peace in you, Lord
[2:22:01] Jesus.
[2:22:04] Come and bless the preacher that you've
[2:22:06] used this morning.
[2:22:09] Remember his family.
[2:22:18] May you grant to him more revelation so
[2:22:20] that he may come forth another time and
[2:22:22] speak to us.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; Bless this assembly, Lord.
[2:22:27] Bless our pastor.
[2:22:32] Bless those who have gone for mission
[2:22:34] work. Pastor Moses
[2:22:36] and Pastor, may you be with them, Lord.
[2:22:41] Deploy your heavenly hammer so that you
[2:22:43] can there can be insecurity.
[2:22:51] Create a spiritual atmosphere wherever
[2:22:53] they'll be, Lord.
[2:22:56] And as we've heard this morning this
[2:22:58] morning,
[2:23:04] let us desire more of this word that
[2:23:06] have been preached this morning
[2:23:13] because in your presence that's where we
[2:23:15] find answers to our questions.
[2:23:18] Manifest yourself Lord Jesus. Bless
[2:23:21] every one of us
[2:23:23] as we are going back home. Lord,
[2:23:28] you know that some came with questions.
[2:23:31] Lord,
[2:23:34] be the answer to all their questions.
[2:23:36] Manifest yourself.
[2:23:39] Uh be with us in our homes.
[2:23:42] We are driving things that are made by
[2:23:44] men.
[2:23:47] Uh protect all the vehicles, Lord.
[2:23:51] In your mighty name Jesus Christ,
[2:23:56] if you grant us another opportunity to
[2:23:58] be in this place, we we thank you Lord.
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; In the name of the Jesus Christ, we
[2:24:04] pray. Amen.
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; Can we say amen?
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; Can we all say one word in French?
[2:24:12] Hallelujah.
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:24:21] with you this afternoon. Amen. God bless
[2:24:24] you. Praise God.
