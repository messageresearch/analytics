[33:13] of who I am.
[33:17] Calvary, he died to redeem his lost
[33:22] bride. The king of kings
[33:26] became my savior.
[33:30] This God's mystery
[33:33] of love expressed to me of Christ and I
[33:40] might be.
[33:44] Who am I?
[33:46] &gt;&gt; Lord, it's who I am.

[34:07] of who I am.
[34:12] Amen. Amen. Revelation of who we are.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Because of the word of
[34:18] God, now we know who we are.
[34:21] &gt;&gt; We are not suffering of spiritual
[34:22] amnesia anymore. Realize who we are.
[34:25] that we come from God. We are going back
[34:27] to God. We are part of God. We can never
[34:30] die as God can never die.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cine of God himself. Glory to his
[34:36] name. Amen. I was struggling there. My
[34:39] throat is not very faithful reliable
[34:41] this morning. So I was claiming but it's
[34:46] good to be in church this morning. Amen.
[34:48] And uh I welcome you all of you and the
[34:51] visitors and among us. God bless you
[34:54] richly. I cannot name all of you but if
[34:57] I miss anyone but God bless you richly.
[35:00] It's good to have um brother Philip's
[35:02] family and all others and from uh from
[35:06] end time message and slic
[35:10] bless you richly and um and brother
[35:13] Brent and brother Brent is you and his
[35:15] family and his wife and his two
[35:17] daughters and God bless you richly.
[35:19] We're welcoming you there to travel.
[35:22] Saskatchewan is not here, right? You
[35:23] have it's a long way. You need to love
[35:27] someone to travel from Saskatchewan to
[35:29] here.
[35:30] Only those who are in love can see that
[35:32] long. It's a short distance. So So if he
[35:36] has traveled that he really loves us. So
[35:38] we we appreciate that and God bless him
[35:41] richly and his family. So we are in
[35:44] great expectation this morning and just
[35:47] looking to the Lord and may you welcome
[35:49] the word of God as you'll be preaching.
[35:51] Say amen to the word of God. May I may
[35:54] may we realize the sacrifice he has made
[35:58] and we just appreciate that by welcoming
[36:01] him and make him feel at home this
[36:03] morning. Amen.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; As a brother I appreciate a lot and as a
[36:07] young minister as I used to be a young
[36:09] minister and now I'm becoming part of
[36:11] the old one.
[36:14] So uh
[36:16] but uh but so I always appreciate him a
[36:20] lot and time messages preaching and he
[36:22] has a gift of singing and preaching at
[36:24] the same time. Few preachers have that.
[36:26] So we want to benefit of that if he can
[36:29] as well. So may God bless him richly.
[36:32] Amen. But Banam says in at that day on
[36:35] Calvary he said now it is hard but the
[36:38] truth you've got to come to the fact to
[36:41] realize what Calvary did for you. Amen.
[36:44] We look at it and say, "Oh, that's
[36:46] fine." He says, "That isn't it?" That if
[36:48] that son had to go to Calvary for
[36:51] crucifixion, every son that comes must
[36:54] go to Calvary.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; He must also have a Calvary, you must
[36:59] have that day of Calvary. I've got to
[37:02] have that day of Calvary that settles
[37:06] the sin question. So, we believe that
[37:08] this morning each person will have that
[37:10] day of Calvary. I want to have that day
[37:12] of Calvary as we heard on on on
[37:15] Wednesday. Just may God give us more
[37:17] revelation of what Calvary means for us.
[37:20] As we look at it, we can never stay the
[37:22] same. But what I'm saying, we cannot go
[37:24] to Calvary and leave that place and
[37:26] remain the same. There must be a change.
[37:29] May God provide that change this
[37:30] morning. Amen. As we invite the word of
[37:33] God just to sing one small song. Um,
[37:39] what did I put there? Such love, such
[37:42] wonderful love because Calvary
[37:44] expression of love. Amen.
[37:50] that God should love
[37:55] such as I should to change my sorrow

[40:57] love a sinner such as I. How wonderful
[41:03] is love like this. Such love. Such love.
[41:10] Such wonderous love. Such love.
[41:16] Such wonderous love that God should love
[41:22] a sinner such as I. How wonderful is
[41:27] love like this.
[41:30] Amen. Can you say amen to that?
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[41:59] whose hearts are full of flame with the
[42:02] fire that fell at Pentecost
[42:06] and made them clean. It is burning now
[42:09] within my heart. All glory to his name.

[43:23] these people may not learn nor bother
[43:30] receive their baptiz in Jesus name we
[43:34] aren't telling now
[43:37] his power is yet the same. And I'm so
[43:40] glad that I can say I'm one of them. One
[43:44] of them one of them.

[44:14] Holy Ghost and powerful service for
[44:17] them. when he
[44:20] is going to do for us today.

[44:25] them.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; One of them.
[44:30] I'm one of them.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them.

[44:45] that you can say I'm one of

[44:55] start the joy bells ringing in the soul
[44:59] of it is burning now within my heart.

[45:30] Let's give the Lord a hand clap.
[45:33] Amen.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful
[45:39] &gt;&gt; that he not only started the joy bells
[45:41] ringing, but he keeps the joy bells
[45:43] ringing. Amen. Amen. Oh, thank you, Lord
[45:47] Jesus. Amen. Well, God bless you richly.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; My goodness. It's good to be here
[45:52] already.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So thankful for the privilege to
[45:56] gather here today. Amen.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; My my this Good Friday.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; It was a good Friday, wasn't it? And
[46:02] it's still a good Friday. Amen. Amen.
[46:05] I'm so glad we received the full benefit
[46:08] of that Good Friday.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Well, I want to thank
[46:12] brother Mo. Can I call you Mo? I just
[46:14] seems like I want to call you Mo.
[46:16] Brother Mo.
[46:18] Thank Mo for being me here and brother
[46:20] Zigg. Thanks for the opportunity to come
[46:23] here today and be with you all. You
[46:24] know, I don't uh I can say I guess I
[46:27] don't know a lot of you real well, but I
[46:28] can say this. I do know your father very
[46:30] well.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. And you know my father
[46:33] in fact we have the same father. Amen.
[46:36] Amen. That makes us brothers and sisters
[46:38] in the body of Christ. Amen. So it's so
[46:41] wonderful to be here today and you know
[46:43] sharing the same goal, the same focus.
[46:46] You know it's be to be a representative
[46:48] of him on earth. Amen. That's what
[46:49] Calvary did to show to the world at the
[46:52] character of Jesus Christ to a dying
[46:55] world. That's really what we're supposed
[46:56] to show here. Because when Christ comes
[46:58] into your life, your goal, your focus
[47:00] now becomes to reflect Christ to that
[47:03] dying generation out there so they can
[47:05] see Jesus Christ. He didn't die just die
[47:08] in a tomb, but he actually raised and
[47:10] now he's living in your heart and
[47:12] working through your flesh. Amen. Amen.
[47:16] My You know what? May not be big in
[47:17] quantity here, but you know, God's
[47:18] looking for quantity. He's looking for
[47:19] quality. Amen.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; It don't take many people to have the
[47:22] Lord Jesus to come where two or three
[47:24] are gathered. And we're so thankful. I
[47:25] count a lot more than that here this
[47:26] morning. Amen.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; So, we're so thankful he's in our
[47:28] presence. And Amen. We know that God is
[47:30] good to us and he's faithful and always
[47:32] comes where he's invited. So, did you
[47:33] invite him here this morning?
[47:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. I trust you bought your little
[47:36] lick of fire. Brother says, "And we all
[47:38] bring our licks of fire that brings the
[47:40] pillar of fire." Amen. Amen. Well, God
[47:43] bless you all. I have a subject on my
[47:45] heart. I was going to I brought it here
[47:47] last last summer back home, but I'd like
[47:50] to turn to the scripture here. We'll get
[47:51] right into the word here to kind of save
[47:54] a little bit of my time here and I don't
[47:55] want to preach too long to you though.
[47:57] But um
[47:59] we'll see if we can get through this
[48:00] here in reasonably good time. Amen. Good
[48:03] to see you, brother Blaine. Good to see
[48:04] you. The other ones here. So listen, God
[48:07] bless you. A few of the other ones. God
[48:08] richly bless you. I've seen some of you
[48:10] around. Don't really know your name that
[48:11] well, but you know what? So thank to be
[48:13] part of the kingdom of God. Amen. Amen.
[48:16] Let's turn to Job chapter 19.
[48:19] And it's along the lines
[48:21] of what uh of the Good Friday. Of
[48:24] course, we want to make that kind of our
[48:25] theme, but want to take a a bit of an
[48:28] angle here that maybe I'm sure you
[48:29] probably heard, but maybe on a slight
[48:31] different angle. You know, the word of
[48:32] God is so just you you can't preach it.
[48:34] There's so many there's so many
[48:36] different avenues you can go with with
[48:37] the word and the scripture. It's just
[48:39] never ending, you know. Amen. Job
[48:41] chapter 19 25 and 26. And we all know
[48:44] this scripture very well.
[48:47] Read your Bible. heard it preached,
[48:49] heard it on tapes. We know that it's a
[48:51] very familiar scripture, but we want to
[48:53] kind of look at Job. Just look at what
[48:55] he's talking about here this morning.
[48:57] And you know, thousands of years before
[48:58] Christ came, here's what he's talking
[49:01] about. Amen. Let's read verse 25. And we
[49:04] all know the scripture says, "For I know
[49:06] I know that my redeemer liveth
[49:10] &gt;&gt; and that he shall stand at this l at the
[49:13] latter day upon the earth. And though
[49:16] the skinworms after my skin worms
[49:18] destroy this body, yet in my flesh I
[49:21] shall see God.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; Now we can see that and say, "Oh yeah,
[49:25] of course we can see we we're going to
[49:26] see it come to pass over." But Job live
[49:28] thousands of years before this happened.
[49:30] That's quite a revelation for a man to
[49:31] have. Amen.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Let's go just a couple of chapters down
[49:34] to Job 23:es
[49:39] 3-6.
[49:42] And and now now let's let's think how
[49:44] Job's thinking here now because he
[49:45] wanted to see God. He wanted to see him.
[49:47] He wanted to know him in a more personal
[49:49] way. And that's what he was trying to
[49:50] that's what he was kind of expressing to
[49:52] himself here as we as he goes along
[49:54] here. And he said this in verse three.
[49:56] Oh that I oh that I know knew where I
[50:00] might find him. Think of that. that I
[50:03] might come even to his seat. For I would
[50:06] order my cause before him and fill my
[50:09] mouth with arguments that pleadings and
[50:11] so forth. For I would know I would know
[50:15] the words which he would answer me and
[50:17] understand what he would say unto me.
[50:20] Will he plead against with me with his
[50:21] great power? No. But he would put
[50:25] strength in me.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh, isn't that wonderful? Joel
[50:29] was just You could just enter into that,
[50:31] can't you? You just see a suffering.
[50:33] Amen. Go to finish off with Romans
[50:35] chapter 5 verse 10.
[50:38] Romans chapter 5 verse 10.
[50:45] Chapter 5 verse 10.
[50:50] Very good. Amen.
[50:53] And it reads like this. For if when we
[50:56] were enemies, think of this now.
[50:59] enemies,
[51:01] not friends, enemies. We were reconciled
[51:04] to God by the death of his son. Much
[51:07] more being reconciled, we shall be saved
[51:10] by his life.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You have your seats.
[51:17] So,
[51:19] as we're looking at this at the
[51:21] scripture here and so forth, and as we
[51:23] look at Job and his and his suffering
[51:24] and and so forth, we we we can enter
[51:27] into Job's suffering to some degree,
[51:29] can't we? You know, we look at his at
[51:31] his suffering and so forth. But, you
[51:33] know, many of us haven't faced the
[51:34] things that Job faced, but you know, we
[51:36] we enter into it because we we realize
[51:38] there's something in his heart that's
[51:40] just really wanting to come out and to
[51:42] see a manifestation of the word of God.
[51:44] Amen. So he, you know, and he and Job
[51:46] lived a holy life and he obeyed the
[51:48] commandments and so forth and he did
[51:51] everything that he had a revelation of.
[51:53] Now think of that now. Job had a certain
[51:55] revelation and everything that he did,
[51:57] he had a re he had a revelation of that
[51:59] he he did and so forth in his children.
[52:00] He said, "Well, per adventure that they
[52:03] might sin and so forth, I'll offer a
[52:05] sacrifice for my children." And that's
[52:06] all that was available is blood of bulls
[52:08] and goats and so forth. But he offered a
[52:10] sacrifice because Job was a righteous
[52:12] person and he wanted to see his family
[52:14] saved. Amen. And that still should be
[52:16] true today. Amen. We still see all the
[52:19] sin and the rampage and so forth and we
[52:20] should be able to make sacrifices of of
[52:23] worship and praise and and sacrifices of
[52:25] prayer for our children. Amen.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when so we look at Job and and
[52:30] you know and he you know God looked at
[52:32] on him as well and and God you know
[52:35] bragged to Satan on to about Job. Amen.
[52:38] You know, and he and that's quite
[52:39] something for God to do that when you
[52:41] think of it. Now, wouldn't you want God
[52:42] to brag on you a little bit to Satan?
[52:43] Say, "Look at my son. You know, look at
[52:46] my daughter at Edmonton. You know, if
[52:47] sin's all rampant, and there's this
[52:50] sickness and sin and disease and all
[52:52] these things around and so forth, but my
[52:55] son and my daughter are right in the
[52:57] midst of Edmonton, worshiping me, living
[52:59] a good, clean life. And I'm proud of
[53:01] them. Look at them. I can put my
[53:03] confidence in some of those people."
[53:05] Amen. Oh my. Why would that be nice to
[53:07] hear that God say that of us? And I
[53:09] believe he does. Amen.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; You see, so so yet, you know, uh, you
[53:13] know, Job didn't have a complete
[53:15] revelation of God. We know that it was
[53:17] limited and so forth. Yet we we look at
[53:20] his ways and so and and you know the
[53:22] thing about it is is when Job was
[53:24] fearing and brother B talks about that
[53:26] and and Job was c fearing certain things
[53:28] and you know many times let me just say
[53:30] this right now many things that you
[53:33] don't understand in your life many
[53:35] things that you don't have answers for
[53:36] in your life right there Satan is right
[53:39] there to create a fear in your life
[53:42] that's exactly what happened to Job said
[53:44] exactly what Job feared came upon him
[53:48] &gt;&gt; you So, Satan's going to be right there
[53:49] when there's the unknown and you don't
[53:51] know what to do about a situation. I
[53:53] don't know how this is going to turn out
[53:54] and I can't see down the road very far.
[53:56] Just remember, don't let fear slip in
[53:59] because fear and doubt is what Satan
[54:02] uses in this day to keep you back from
[54:05] God.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; And if we've ever fought fear and doubt
[54:08] and we've ever had that, it's in this
[54:10] lady age. Amen.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; You see, there might not be a whole lot
[54:13] of fear, but it's the it's the state of
[54:15] being fearful. Amen.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you think of it, what have
[54:18] you got to fear?
[54:20] &gt;&gt; What have you got to fear?
[54:24] &gt;&gt; That's it's a good question, isn't it?
[54:26] &gt;&gt; You're you're here and you're healthy
[54:27] and so you might not be healthy, but
[54:29] regardless, God's got a promise and so
[54:31] forth, and God provided all your needs
[54:33] and all these things, but yet we
[54:34] struggle with that, don't we? Some more
[54:36] than others. But we won't get into that
[54:38] too much here today. But but look at
[54:40] this now. Right. Right. It's that that's
[54:42] where fear is sitting. Right at that
[54:44] door is when you don't know what to do
[54:47] about a situation or how it's all going
[54:49] to turn out. Now look what brother says
[54:51] here in the book of Job. It says here
[54:52] Job feared and what he feared it
[54:54] actually happened. What brought it? His
[54:57] fear did.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; See that's what made it happen. His
[54:59] faith would have kept him. Oh. Oh. Oh.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Oh. His faith would have kept him from
[55:05] it. Oh, I see. So, so when you have
[55:08] faith, you can't have fear. So, why why
[55:10] do you think Satan tries to get you to
[55:11] fear so much? is because you can't have
[55:13] faith and what God wants to see. He
[55:15] says, "Will I find faith when I come
[55:18] back?" Amen.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; You see, we got to know the tactics of
[55:22] the enemy
[55:23] &gt;&gt; because soon as that fear slips in,
[55:24] faith cannot have a good foundation to
[55:28] believe God and believe for his
[55:29] promises, believe for his blessings, and
[55:31] believe for everything that you have
[55:32] need of. Right?
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Let me finish it though. He said it
[55:36] brought it to him. He was scared it was
[55:37] going to happen. It did happen. Now, I
[55:38] would be knowing it wouldn't have
[55:40] happened. It wouldn't have happened. But
[55:42] see, see what I mean? If you're afraid
[55:43] when you come by the prayer line, well,
[55:45] maybe I just haven't got this face
[55:47] sufficient.
[55:49] Oh, okay. It'll never happen. Don't
[55:52] worry. See, but if you know what's going
[55:53] to happen, it'll happen. It's actually a
[55:56] substance of something. You see, so it
[55:59] actually has to be in you. And you can't
[56:01] doubt. You actually has to have a
[56:03] substance. Something saying, "I believe
[56:05] God's promises. I got faith. I see it in
[56:08] the scripture. And I'm applying it to my
[56:10] life. I'm just going to keep it nice and
[56:11] simple and say, "God, if you said it and
[56:13] you promised it, I believe it." And that
[56:15] settles it.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; It's just simple, friends. We over we
[56:19] overdo it so much. We think so
[56:21] complicated about faith. It's just like
[56:23] just like it just it's so common. Just
[56:25] like just like faith when Moses when he
[56:27] when he struck it just simple common
[56:28] weed. That's all it is. You have faith
[56:31] to leave here, right? You have faith
[56:32] right now that your car's in the parking
[56:34] lot, don't you? Yeah,
[56:35] &gt;&gt; even though it's a bad city,
[56:38] &gt;&gt; you locked your car and you have faith.
[56:40] You're not even thinking about it now.
[56:41] Maybe you are now cuz I mentioned it,
[56:42] but in general, you're just going to
[56:44] walk out there and you're going to take
[56:46] out your keys and your car is going to
[56:48] be right around the corner.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; That's just simple faith.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; That's all it is.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Just simple. Just think exactly the same
[56:54] way with the word of God. It just says
[56:57] it. So, I believe it and I'm resting on
[57:00] it. And there nothing more needs to be
[57:02] said. My life's in his hands. I believe
[57:04] his words. Because just remember,
[57:06] friends, we can't lose this thing. When
[57:08] we if we get sick and say, "Well, what
[57:10] if God would take my life?" Well, what
[57:12] if God would take your life? You're
[57:13] going through a far better place.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; So, what have you got to lose in this
[57:17] thing?
[57:20] You're not my subject here, but let's
[57:22] let's keep going. Maybe somebody needed
[57:23] that. Think of this now. You can't
[57:25] figure things out. See
[57:27] See, God's faith in you comes to the
[57:30] rescue. You realize that? See, God's got
[57:33] a place of faith inside of you. You see,
[57:36] when you come to Christ, and you know,
[57:37] how many believes the message of the
[57:39] hour?
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many are Christians? Amen. So,
[57:42] when you come there and you come, the
[57:44] only way you could come is that God
[57:47] supernaturally had to place that seed of
[57:50] faith in your life in order for you to
[57:53] even believe what you're believing.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; You can't even believe unless there's a
[57:58] seed of God, there's a faith inside of
[58:00] you to believe it. Amen.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you wouldn't be here. You
[58:02] wouldn't believe it. You say, "It's just
[58:04] nothing but this and that, whatever. I
[58:05] don't care. I'm not believing. I'm just
[58:06] going forth." Yeah. You don't got the
[58:07] faith.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; When his faith is placed inside of you,
[58:11] &gt;&gt; whole different story. Amen.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; All right. But you can see now how it
[58:16] consumed Job and his thinking and and
[58:19] and you and he looked at nature and he
[58:21] and he saw a pattern. Amen. And and he
[58:23] looked at every tree, how it lives and
[58:25] how it dies and then how it lives again.
[58:28] He looked at every every every blade of
[58:31] grass, how it is living and and I see it
[58:33] dying and and then all of a sudden comes
[58:34] forth again. Wh why why is that? And you
[58:37] know every flower and all of nature is
[58:40] acquainted with resurrection. You see,
[58:42] so Job didn't have the answer. And he
[58:44] says, "And everything lives and
[58:46] everything dies and and everything lives
[58:48] again." He says, "But what about
[58:49] mankind? What about us? What happens to
[58:51] us? What is our end result? Why don't we
[58:54] live again? I see people going into the
[58:56] grave, but what's the final answer?
[58:58] What's going on here is God? There's got
[59:00] to be something else.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; I'm not seeing here.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Now, that's the foundation of a good
[59:09] Friday.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; That's where Good Friday had to come.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Think of this now. Everything has this,
[59:17] but man has no resurrection. What what
[59:20] what what happens here? And and you see
[59:23] that did cause a fear in Job. You see,
[59:25] any man that's got, you know, any man
[59:27] that's got any sense of God about him in
[59:29] this day would realize and and would
[59:31] start looking ahead at his future after
[59:34] death,
[59:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[59:36] &gt;&gt; And say, "Okay, okay, I live till 30,
[59:38] 40, okay, I'm going to keep myself in
[59:40] shape. I'm going to run. I'm going to
[59:41] jog. I'm going to, you know, lift
[59:42] weights. I'm going to keep myself really
[59:43] buff. And I'm going to eat all this all
[59:45] this stuff and organic and healthy and
[59:47] all those things." That's good. That's
[59:48] fine. You might live another 10 years,
[59:50] 20 years. You might live till 80, 90,
[59:52] 95, but what about after that?
[59:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, well, well, something will be
[59:57] figured out. No, you're going to get
[59:58] old. I don't care. Your bones are
[59:59] getting old. You're getting old. Your
[1:00:01] skin's getting wrinkly. Your heart's
[1:00:03] getting weaker. And all those things are
[1:00:05] coming upon you. You have a day that you
[1:00:07] have to prepare for. Right.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; That's right. So wouldn't it behoove all
[1:00:11] of us and we I trust all of us have here
[1:00:13] but any common sense thinking person
[1:00:15] would think yeah there's uh I I got to
[1:00:19] be looking at my life here past this
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; right
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; now think of this now
[1:00:26] you're preparing to make ready for the
[1:00:28] next life now
[1:00:30] you're not looking to live in this
[1:00:31] carnal flesh and you realize that this
[1:00:33] carnal flesh has a certain amount of
[1:00:35] days and certain amount of years and
[1:00:36] it's all over no matter how healthy you
[1:00:38] are or what you do and how you live.
[1:00:40] You've got to face that someday and
[1:00:42] you've got an appointment with God.
[1:00:43] Amen. So, you're not looking under this
[1:00:45] world system and and but rather what you
[1:00:46] are is you're looking for a home. You're
[1:00:48] really looking for a land beyond the
[1:00:50] river. You're looking for the saints
[1:00:52] that have gone before. You're looking
[1:00:53] for something crying out in your heart.
[1:00:56] There's got to be something more than
[1:00:58] this. I I've never seen it with my eyes.
[1:01:00] And my five senses don't declare, but my
[1:01:03] six sense faith declares that there's
[1:01:06] something beyond this other realm that I
[1:01:08] can't see, I can't feel, I can't smell
[1:01:11] or taste, but I know it is there. That's
[1:01:14] your six sense. That's faith speaking
[1:01:16] right now.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; Something.
[1:01:21] See, that's what brings your healing.
[1:01:23] See, if you know that you know that you
[1:01:24] know that just beyond this last breath
[1:01:27] there is life, can't you take that same
[1:01:31] faith and ask God to deliver you, to
[1:01:34] heal you?
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Can't you do that if you know that you
[1:01:38] know that you know you see we even gave
[1:01:40] him an extra special blessing in in this
[1:01:42] in this generation that we lived in. God
[1:01:44] knew how sinful it was going to be and
[1:01:45] so forth. And God had a man by the name
[1:01:47] of William Brandham. And God allowed him
[1:01:50] by grace to go over and see just beyond
[1:01:53] this last breath. Now, if that ought to
[1:01:55] give you an encouragement, friends, I
[1:01:57] don't know what will because God allowed
[1:01:59] him to see just beyond the last breath.
[1:02:02] And not only for him, but for you and
[1:02:05] for you and for the bride in this last
[1:02:07] age. We've got something to look forward
[1:02:10] to. Amen.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Just beyond
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; this last breath,
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; there's something something inside of
[1:02:18] me.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; That I can't explain that my five senses
[1:02:22] don't declare, but I know that I know
[1:02:23] that I know. And I believe that vision
[1:02:27] that the prophet had. And you know what?
[1:02:30] I'm going to be a partaker of that
[1:02:31] vision.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be one of those ones and
[1:02:33] say, you know what? We are resting on
[1:02:36] that.
[1:02:37] We are resting on the message that you
[1:02:39] sent through your prophet. We are
[1:02:41] resting on the restoration that what you
[1:02:43] said and those messages are the truth
[1:02:46] and it's backed up by the Bible. We
[1:02:48] don't need any more proof. We've got all
[1:02:50] the proof we need. We know what is true
[1:02:52] and we're standing on it.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Think of this now. See, so something
[1:03:04] inside of Job's heart was beating just
[1:03:06] like what you had. You can't prove
[1:03:08] anything with a natural eye, but he just
[1:03:09] knew that he knew that he knew. And he
[1:03:11] just saw a matter of there, but he see
[1:03:14] the saw the huge chasm between God and
[1:03:18] man and what the difference was of sin
[1:03:21] that separated them two.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; He saw man over here so sinful and
[1:03:25] remember the days of Noah had, you know,
[1:03:27] and so forth had already passed and, you
[1:03:29] know, here is Job on the other side of
[1:03:30] it and so forth. You see how sinful man
[1:03:32] God got God and God to destroy it. And
[1:03:34] here he sees over here and a holy God
[1:03:36] and a righteous God. So perfect, so
[1:03:38] holy. A million sons, brother M says,
[1:03:40] will be black in his sight. Oh my. Wow.
[1:03:45] What a holy God.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; What a sinful man.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; What a huge chasm that is.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; That's huge.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Absolutely astronomical. I can't even
[1:03:56] think. Then he had a revelation of that
[1:03:58] and he saw that huge chasm. And so
[1:04:00] that's why you go out.
[1:04:02] If I could if I could only speak to you
[1:04:04] somehow. If I could just if I could just
[1:04:06] go to you, go to your door and knock and
[1:04:10] just look at you eye to eye like a human
[1:04:12] to human and just just just have a
[1:04:14] little talk over with you. Said, "No,
[1:04:16] no, no, no. He wouldn't he wouldn't he
[1:04:18] wouldn't build he wouldn't tear me down
[1:04:19] and he wouldn't kick me in the dirt."
[1:04:21] No, but he would put strength in me.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; You have that much of a revelation of
[1:04:25] God.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. But look at Job. All these
[1:04:28] things that happened to him. Look at the
[1:04:30] revelation Job had. This is coming right
[1:04:31] now. He said how he faced all the
[1:04:34] suffering, all the suffering, all the
[1:04:35] suffering. How could he say he'd put
[1:04:36] strength in him? Why? Cuz there was
[1:04:38] something holding Job through all those
[1:04:41] trials, all those temptations, all those
[1:04:43] tests. And he said, "No, if I would talk
[1:04:45] to him face to face, he would put
[1:04:47] strength in me."
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; He's a strength giver
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; through all those trials.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; He's the one that gives strength.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Oh my What a God.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; That's what he's thinking. There's got
[1:05:04] to be someone.
[1:05:06] There's got to be something someone
[1:05:09] somewhere somehow
[1:05:12] that could bridge that gap.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Someone somewhere. Job said, you know, I
[1:05:18] I want to do right, you know, and you
[1:05:20] see, I want to act right. I I want to
[1:05:22] live right and talk right. And you see
[1:05:24] people in this world and they're all
[1:05:25] confused and they see the churches over
[1:05:27] down the road over here in these certain
[1:05:29] denominations. Think, well, yeah, that's
[1:05:31] that's fine. I want to live holy. So,
[1:05:33] but I don't see them living holy. I
[1:05:35] don't see them talking holy. They live
[1:05:36] like the world. They act like the world.
[1:05:38] They talk like the world. They dress
[1:05:39] like the world. There's nothing in it
[1:05:40] but a bunch of hypocrites. I can
[1:05:42] understand that, right? You see, but
[1:05:45] there's something inside wanted to do
[1:05:47] all those things. Let me just say to you
[1:05:48] today, that's God's faith in you. If you
[1:05:51] can take it and God will reveal the
[1:05:53] truth to you, you'll see a truth and God
[1:05:55] will open himself right up to you.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; But just see that in this day. I have a
[1:06:01] sword for some of those people and you
[1:06:03] and you try to talk to them and so
[1:06:04] forth. But you know, you know, but Job
[1:06:06] was saying, you know, I have that I live
[1:06:09] right, act right, you want to talk
[1:06:10] right, and do all those things, but I
[1:06:12] need more than what I got right now.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; How many can say that? I love the Lord.
[1:06:16] I got the message. I I I trust I got the
[1:06:18] Holy Ghost, but I I need more. I need
[1:06:21] more of God in my life. There's certain
[1:06:22] things hanging on me that shouldn't be
[1:06:24] hanging on me. There's certain things I
[1:06:25] got to go through and certain things I
[1:06:27] faced from my family members over the
[1:06:30] years and it's come right through and I
[1:06:31] can see I face the same temptations and
[1:06:33] I struggle and I got weights. Let me
[1:06:35] just tell you there and you don't have
[1:06:36] to live that way. God's got a
[1:06:39] deliverance for you.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Think of this now.
[1:06:45] I got a desire to do right. Who can
[1:06:47] change my sinful nature? Who can take
[1:06:50] the desire?
[1:06:52] There it is right there.
[1:06:54] Who can take the desire
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; of sin away?
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Where I just want to sin all the time.
[1:07:03] You know, that's a really good example
[1:07:05] of where you're at with the Lord. If you
[1:07:07] really got some, am I born again,
[1:07:09] Brother Brand? I don't know. But I tell
[1:07:10] you one thing. Check your desires. If
[1:07:13] you still have the desires of the world
[1:07:15] and still feeding on those things and
[1:07:16] you enjoy it and you love it and you
[1:07:18] just that's your element. Just remember
[1:07:20] the spirit of God can't be in there.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; You see that's simple. That's nuts and
[1:07:27] bolts preaching, but that's absolutely
[1:07:28] the truth.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; You've got to check your life. I got to
[1:07:32] check my life.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Is God there? What am I feel? What do I
[1:07:35] want to feel? What is my desire? Do I
[1:07:37] get it? Do I get pleasure in being in
[1:07:39] the presence of the Lord or is it just
[1:07:40] like a constant constant ah I got to get
[1:07:43] out of here. I got to get out of here.
[1:07:45] Why? Because you feel conviction. That's
[1:07:47] why so many sinners they don't want to
[1:07:48] be in church. They want to be able to
[1:07:49] sing. So when the Holy Spirit comes down
[1:07:50] and they don't want that in their life
[1:07:52] and they don't they're resisting
[1:07:53] resisting resisting it's very
[1:07:54] uncomfortable to be in church,
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Right. It is.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Think of this now. But now Job was
[1:08:01] saying when he caught the vision, he
[1:08:02] says, "I I I I couldn't tell you the
[1:08:04] name." He says, "You didn't know the
[1:08:06] name. All he knew is I knew him by a
[1:08:08] title. And his title is the re my
[1:08:10] redeemer. He says I know my redeemer
[1:08:12] liveth. But now we can boldly say
[1:08:14] thousands of years later we know of a
[1:08:17] man. Amen. We know of a man. I say I
[1:08:19] can't heal myself. I can't save myself.
[1:08:22] I can't do anything of myself. But one
[1:08:24] thing I do know, I know of a man that
[1:08:27] can do it. Amen. And he is the one that
[1:08:30] can bridge the overwhelming gap between
[1:08:33] God and man. And his name is Jesus
[1:08:37] Christ.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; You see, we got a revelation of that
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; and we are the recipients of that.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:48] So, we're going f 2,000 years past Job
[1:08:51] and seeing and 4,000 years actually now,
[1:08:53] but we're seeing more closely to the end
[1:08:56] of the book because we're in the end of
[1:08:57] the book right now. Amen. We're seeing
[1:08:59] all these things come to pass.
[1:09:02] Think of this now, Brother Ram said
[1:09:04] here, see what what was what was he
[1:09:06] doing? See, he was bridging that huge
[1:09:08] gap that seemed so impossible to gap.
[1:09:12] And I can't, you know, we I can never
[1:09:14] build a a far enough uh side here or
[1:09:17] here to make it far enough for you to
[1:09:19] realize how far of a gap that was.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; But now think of this. Look at brother
[1:09:24] says he's right in the midst of his
[1:09:25] distress. Job right while the very
[1:09:28] darkest of hour was just in that g great
[1:09:30] crucial moment. Then came down the
[1:09:32] little lieuh and began to speak to him
[1:09:35] telling him that the flower had not
[1:09:36] sinned but he but he was the one that
[1:09:38] sinned and that there was there would be
[1:09:40] a resurrection. someday there would be a
[1:09:42] just one who would come make conformable
[1:09:44] to this world and in the form of God's
[1:09:46] image. Now think of this now. He's
[1:09:49] telling him now that there's going to be
[1:09:50] someone that you eventually can go knock
[1:09:53] on his door and say hello mister. Hello
[1:09:56] God. Can I just sit down and talk with
[1:09:58] you for a little while?
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; What a man would take upon him the form
[1:10:04] of sinful flesh otherwise and would
[1:10:06] stand in the breach. Look at this now.
[1:10:08] between an angry holy God and a sinful
[1:10:12] man and would put his hands on both of
[1:10:14] them.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Oh my
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; and bridge the way.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; If you could just get a grasp on that,
[1:10:26] just truly get a revelation of that,
[1:10:30] things would be different for in your
[1:10:31] life.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you realize the love that
[1:10:35] flowed out from God himself to you to
[1:10:38] you to you.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; You put your name in there.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at this.
[1:10:45] My redeemer liveth. See, Job have a See,
[1:10:49] look at this. How Job's incredible
[1:10:50] revelation was in the back of that day.
[1:10:51] See, Job had a revelation of where to be
[1:10:54] buried. You know that he said, "Don't
[1:10:56] bury me anywhere here. here. Bear me in
[1:10:58] this area because that area is going to
[1:11:00] be called Palestine and I'm actually
[1:11:02] going to be buried there. But you know
[1:11:04] what? The others down through the ages
[1:11:06] said, "Don't bury me here. Don't bury me
[1:11:08] in Egypt." And Joseph had that same
[1:11:09] revelation. Says, "When you come out of
[1:11:11] this land, which you are, because God
[1:11:12] promised it through his prophet." He
[1:11:14] says, "When you come out, don't bury my
[1:11:16] bones here, take my bones with me
[1:11:18] because I want to be buried in
[1:11:20] Palestine." Isaac, Jacob, all the
[1:11:22] patriarchs, they got buried there
[1:11:23] because that is where they want to bury.
[1:11:25] And that's the same revelation that we
[1:11:27] have in this day. Don't bury me in sin.
[1:11:30] Don't bury me in this denomination. But
[1:11:31] bury me in Christ. That's all I want to
[1:11:34] be buried in. Just let me die with
[1:11:37] Christ so I can live again.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Just let me be buried with Christ.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Because we're buried with Christ. We
[1:11:48] raised with Christ.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; You see, Christ is already raised. So
[1:11:51] that's why we're not we're not living.
[1:11:53] We're not seeing a a tomb full of bones
[1:11:56] in Jerusalem. And we're seeing an empty
[1:11:58] tomb and an empty grave showing what
[1:12:00] that there will be an empty grave. There
[1:12:02] will be an empty tomb of our loved ones
[1:12:04] that have gone before cuz there will be
[1:12:06] a resurrection in this day. And God will
[1:12:09] take all that flesh that had died under
[1:12:11] all those years and make them come right
[1:12:13] out of the grave again.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; My goodness.
[1:12:20] That's what your God's capable of. Not
[1:12:23] only capable, he say he's going to do
[1:12:24] it.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Bury me in Christ.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; I don't care what you do. I don't care
[1:12:37] where else you go. See that revelation
[1:12:38] they all had?
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; And you fast forward it to this day. I
[1:12:42] don't care what happens. I don't care
[1:12:44] what goes on. That's why we same thing.
[1:12:46] You know, friends, that's why we got to
[1:12:47] teach our kids that the same thing is I
[1:12:49] don't care what you do. Just remember
[1:12:50] one thing. Serving the Lord is the most
[1:12:53] important thing important decision
[1:12:55] you'll ever make in life. Yeah, you'll
[1:12:56] buy a home, you'll buy a car. You make
[1:12:58] those think those are important in the
[1:12:59] natural. Yes, they are important. We
[1:13:01] need to have them in this day and day.
[1:13:02] But just remember one thing. There's
[1:13:04] nothing more important in your life than
[1:13:06] surrendering your heart to Jesus Christ
[1:13:09] and give it to him and letting him use
[1:13:11] your flesh in this day. That's what you
[1:13:14] were created for.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Oh my
[1:13:21] It's more important than anything.
[1:13:22] Brother says it's the most important
[1:13:23] decision you'll make in your life.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Anybody know the second most?
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Marriage.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; That's really important, too.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Look at this now. So, Brother Bam talks
[1:13:38] about a bridge, God bridging the way for
[1:13:40] mankind.
[1:13:42] I want to take a natural type just so
[1:13:43] you can kind of go through the types and
[1:13:44] so forth. Bman talks about about a
[1:13:46] famous bridge and he talks about the
[1:13:49] Sydney Harbor Bridge in Sydney,
[1:13:51] Australia. How many have ever gone
[1:13:52] across a Sydney Harbor Bridge? Nobody.
[1:13:55] All right, that's pretty far. It's
[1:13:57] pretty far. It's in Sydney, Australia.
[1:13:59] You see, and and he says it connects the
[1:14:01] central business district to the north
[1:14:03] Sydney. So, it's a connection between
[1:14:05] the between the between the the water
[1:14:07] and so forth. So the Sydney Harden
[1:14:09] Bridge say I find it interesting that
[1:14:11] the bridge he uses from the natural to
[1:14:13] the spiritual type was actually built in
[1:14:16] an area full of previous convicts and
[1:14:19] criminals.
[1:14:21] You know that's what Australia was,
[1:14:22] right? They sent all the criminals
[1:14:24] there. All the convicts. And I tell you
[1:14:26] what, that's in the natural. But I tell
[1:14:27] you what, if there's ever a place ever a
[1:14:29] way that needed to be bridged for
[1:14:31] convicts and criminals say, "Well,
[1:14:32] brother Ben Brand, I never stole. I
[1:14:34] never did this. I never been charged on
[1:14:35] life. You might have a clean record
[1:14:36] according to the police report and so
[1:14:38] forth in the natural. But I tell you
[1:14:39] what, we were enemies with God one time.
[1:14:42] And we were convicts and criminals in
[1:14:44] his eyes. But God took that very same
[1:14:46] bridge and he put it right in the heart
[1:14:48] of all the convicts, all the criminals,
[1:14:51] all the worst of the worst. And said,
[1:14:53] "That's where I'm going to build my
[1:14:55] bridge." Cuz those are the people that
[1:14:58] need me, that want me, that desire me.
[1:15:06] Not the people that think they have
[1:15:09] everything and they don't need God. Boy,
[1:15:11] do we ever see that in this day.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; I don't need God.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't need God. Okay. Well, just
[1:15:16] wait till you go on your deathbed here.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; You'll see how much you need God.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; You see that? You see, you can see the
[1:15:21] worst sinner. Many of times they'll say
[1:15:22] God in some form or fashion. They'll
[1:15:24] reach out to some higher power than
[1:15:25] them.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, God says, "Be careful. Don't do it
[1:15:29] all. Don't mock me all your life because
[1:15:30] at your death, but I'll just laugh.
[1:15:34] Find me when I can be found.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Brother, do you believe in a death, bur
[1:15:37] resurrection? Absolutely I do. The thief
[1:15:39] on the cross had one.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; I tell you, I don't want to wait till
[1:15:41] that time.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; I don't want to just barely squeak in,
[1:15:46] barely last minute. I want God to take
[1:15:48] my life. And when I'm a young boy and I
[1:15:50] can serve him when I'm a young boy, I
[1:15:52] don't care if you're 5 years old, 10
[1:15:54] years old, 15 years old. You can do
[1:15:56] something for the kingdom of God. But I
[1:15:58] don't want it to stop there. I'm to take
[1:15:59] him right through my teenage years and
[1:16:01] my adult years in my marriage and in my
[1:16:03] grandchildren. I want to see a life
[1:16:05] fulfilled where I can serve the Lord and
[1:16:08] be a help and edify the body of Christ.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Not just barely get in.
[1:16:16] Amen. Not just barely get in. Think of
[1:16:20] this now.
[1:16:24] See, these are the ones, the people that
[1:16:28] aren't the big somebodyies, the people
[1:16:30] that think they got everything. And many
[1:16:32] times, and I'm not saying you can't be
[1:16:33] rich in this day, but God doesn't always
[1:16:35] take the popular and the rich and all
[1:16:36] the famous people of the world because
[1:16:38] he cannot use them. There's nothing in
[1:16:40] them that he can use. See, you're placed
[1:16:42] in those in those people. Look at all
[1:16:44] the generations all throughout time.
[1:16:46] It's many of the simple people that
[1:16:48] could might not have much of the world's
[1:16:50] good, but they could receive a God. They
[1:16:52] could receive it and say, "I'm nothing.
[1:16:54] I always will be nothing." And you know
[1:16:55] what? God, you're so holy, and I'm just
[1:16:58] a sinner, but God, you you said you have
[1:17:00] a way for me. And that opens up that
[1:17:02] bridge. Amen.
[1:17:05] Look at this. Now, brother says this.
[1:17:07] Now, in this word, in this way, we like
[1:17:09] to like in the word of God. God is a
[1:17:11] great architect. He's a great builder as
[1:17:13] God puts in his building nothing but the
[1:17:16] very best. And I would liken him this to
[1:17:18] the story I read of the great Sydney
[1:17:20] Bridge in Sydney, Australia. Many years
[1:17:21] ago, they decide to build a bridge
[1:17:23] across the great straight of water there
[1:17:25] that connected north and south Sydney.
[1:17:27] Many come to bid, but up into England
[1:17:30] coming a renowned contractor who had a
[1:17:32] reputation behind him that he wanted to
[1:17:34] build this bridge. Now, though his
[1:17:36] prices was high, the people Sydney
[1:17:38] didn't mind that they wanted the bill
[1:17:40] the bridge built right.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; All right. So it took them 55 years to
[1:17:47] build that bridge.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; 55 years to build that bridge.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; That's crazy in our terms nowadays. We
[1:17:53] think 1 2 3 4 5 years maybe with the
[1:17:56] advanced technology. We have 55 years to
[1:17:58] build that bridge. The price was high.
[1:18:01] Very high.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, I'm always thinking
[1:18:03] spiritually now. This gospel came with a
[1:18:07] great price.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; This gospel came with a very high price
[1:18:11] tag on it. But God said, "I'm not going
[1:18:13] to cheap out. I'm not going to get some
[1:18:15] cheap garbage and so forth to build it
[1:18:17] with. I want the best of the best of the
[1:18:20] best to be built in that bridge because
[1:18:22] there's going to be many depend on that
[1:18:24] bridge one day and it's got to be built
[1:18:26] right for my children.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; The price was very high.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Very very high without money without
[1:18:32] price.
[1:18:34] But there takes a sacrifice.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; It remains the tallest steel arch bridge
[1:18:39] in the world today.
[1:18:41] This tallest steel arch bridge. Brother
[1:18:44] says, "I think every Christian ought to
[1:18:46] take the same attitude." That's right.
[1:18:48] We want to know where we're standing. We
[1:18:50] don't want our eternal destination built
[1:18:52] upon the shifting sands of some church
[1:18:53] theology, right? Built on but on the
[1:18:56] eternal word of the living God. Because
[1:18:58] remember, every one of you sitting here
[1:19:00] tonight, stormy times is going to hit
[1:19:02] that building you're sitting in tonight.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; What's your building? Your flesh.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Stormy times are going to hit your
[1:19:08] building.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; And you're going to come up through some
[1:19:10] hard times.
[1:19:13] death's going to strike and you better
[1:19:15] know what kind of sand it's built on or
[1:19:17] what kind of a foundation that it has.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; This man's name was John Bradfield,
[1:19:25] chief architect from England.
[1:19:28] He started planning. The planning
[1:19:30] started in 1914.
[1:19:33] Could that Oh, thanks, buddy. Forgot
[1:19:35] one.
[1:19:37] Why do I need one? Well, I get excited
[1:19:38] about the word of God. If there's
[1:19:40] anything we need to get excited about is
[1:19:41] the word of God. Amen.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; We may get excited about sports and
[1:19:44] about a certain food and we get all
[1:19:46] excited about those things, but man, we
[1:19:48] should never get more excited than the
[1:19:49] word of God. Amen.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; All right. So, the planning started in
[1:19:54] 1914 and the construction started in
[1:19:57] 1923.
[1:19:59] Now, think of this now.
[1:20:03] Sorry. When I took them and said took
[1:20:04] them 55 years, I'm in 55 years to pay
[1:20:06] off. I'm sorry. I made a mistake there.
[1:20:08] took him 55 years because the price was
[1:20:10] high. So it took him 55 years to pay
[1:20:12] this bridge off but the construction
[1:20:14] took six years to build 1923 to 1929. So
[1:20:18] it took numerous years to build but the
[1:20:20] price was very high. The debt was very
[1:20:22] high for for for Australia but they
[1:20:23] wanted it built done built right. It
[1:20:26] took them 55 years to pay that off. So
[1:20:28] uh when you think of this now the
[1:20:30] planning started when it when it did
[1:20:32] 1920 or construction 1923. See, it took
[1:20:35] a lot more planning than it did actually
[1:20:38] building.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Now, think of this. Now, God before the
[1:20:41] foundation of the world knew that there
[1:20:43] had to be something.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; God had planned it way, way before you
[1:20:49] were born, way before Job was born, way
[1:20:51] before the world was constructed, way
[1:20:54] before all he was was an eternal
[1:20:56] presence. Not even God yet. But in his
[1:20:59] mind and his planning, he said, "There
[1:21:01] will be a man on this earth that I can
[1:21:05] call a savior that I'm going to come and
[1:21:07] I'm going to redeem mankind." That
[1:21:10] planning took thousands, millions,
[1:21:12] trillions of years.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; But planning for that one day,
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; one day,
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; one day,
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; today,
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Good Friday,
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; all that
[1:21:28] took so long to plant.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; But look what he did. Christ was only on
[1:21:33] the earth for 33 years and yet thousands
[1:21:36] of years. All the prophets, all the
[1:21:37] sages, all the ones prophesied, he's
[1:21:39] coming. He's coming. He's coming. Job
[1:21:42] says, "I want to see him." Ezekiel said
[1:21:43] he's the me wheel in the middle of the
[1:21:45] wheel. And here comes Elisha and Moses.
[1:21:47] There'll be a prophet like unto me. All
[1:21:49] of them prophesying, prophesying,
[1:21:50] prophesying, prophesying. And here he
[1:21:52] comes on this earth. There he is. I am
[1:21:56] standing on this earth right now and I'm
[1:21:59] here to do my job that was commissioned
[1:22:02] to me before the foundation of the
[1:22:03] world.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:22:08] Think of this now.
[1:22:10] Everyone prophesying is going to come.
[1:22:12] See, many architects came from all
[1:22:14] around the world.
[1:22:16] All around the world.
[1:22:18] You see what happened was is they dug up
[1:22:20] the soil and they dug it all up and they
[1:22:22] dug it up and they took samples of
[1:22:23] sovere like any good architect would and
[1:22:26] they took it up and they said to said
[1:22:27] they said to Sydney they said that
[1:22:29] bridge cannot be built. There's way too
[1:22:32] much quicksand there and he said it just
[1:22:35] cannot be built. It's absolutely
[1:22:36] impossible. He said but brother said it
[1:22:39] took a man a vision.
[1:22:42] Oh. Oh. Someone just then the ordinary
[1:22:45] common area common guy actually had to
[1:22:47] have someone with a vision and seeing
[1:22:49] and not only looking what's present
[1:22:51] right in front of him but actually
[1:22:52] looking into the future and seeing
[1:22:55] something that was actually possible
[1:22:57] although considered impossible
[1:22:59] are you men of
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; are you men of vision are you women of
[1:23:03] vision
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; do you see the vision of your life oh my
[1:23:06] friends it's so nice to see prophecy and
[1:23:08] we read in this book all the prophecies
[1:23:11] of what's coming to pass and the lady
[1:23:12] Osia And we see all these promises to
[1:23:14] the believer. But let me ask you a
[1:23:16] question, friends. It's good when it's
[1:23:18] in here, but can you place yourself
[1:23:21] inside of this book? Can you place
[1:23:23] yourself inside of these prophecies and
[1:23:26] realize I am not only just looking at
[1:23:28] the prophecies and reading in the
[1:23:30] prophecies? I am come part of the
[1:23:34] prophecy. Amen.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; I am fulfilling prophecy.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Everyone's fulfilling prophecy in this
[1:23:45] day. You know that.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Whether good or bad, they're all
[1:23:48] fulfilling prophecy. Look at Pharaoh. He
[1:23:51] was fulfilling prophecy.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Look at Moses. He was fulfilling
[1:23:54] prophecy. Two people fulfilling one for
[1:23:56] the good, one for the bad.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; There's only one question to ask
[1:24:00] yourself.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; What side of this prophecy are you
[1:24:02] fulfilling?
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:05] Amen.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; So, they all said it just cannot be
[1:24:10] done. No, just can't be done. Too much
[1:24:13] quick sand. Forget it. You bunch of
[1:24:15] convicts and criminals.
[1:24:18] It ain't never going to get this bridge
[1:24:20] done. There's no way. There's no
[1:24:21] possible way. So, forget it. We're not
[1:24:23] doing it. And it just will have to be
[1:24:24] this way. You have to take the boat,
[1:24:26] whatever would be. It's just it's just
[1:24:28] inconvenient. I know. But, you know,
[1:24:29] this bridge cannot be built. So John
[1:24:31] Bradfield had a little bit different
[1:24:32] vision though. He think he saw everyone
[1:24:34] thought it was impossible to build but
[1:24:36] he looked at it from a different
[1:24:37] perspective. You see you think of this
[1:24:39] now brother said but this man was a man
[1:24:42] of vision and he knew that what he was
[1:24:45] talking about for something down in him
[1:24:48] told him he could do it. Look what
[1:24:50] brother says. God give us men in the
[1:24:53] church like that.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Give us people in this church here this
[1:24:57] morning. Give us people in other
[1:24:58] churches here this morning that can look
[1:25:00] at the promises, look at the blessings,
[1:25:03] look at this word and saying, "I know it
[1:25:04] was written and I know it's on the
[1:25:06] pages. I can read it, but I want to
[1:25:09] become part of it. And I realize that if
[1:25:12] my faith can actually contact these
[1:25:14] promises if I believe,
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; I want to make this book real
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; because it is real. It's just how you're
[1:25:22] looking at it, friends.
[1:25:24] If you can receive it by faith.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:30] My oh my. Men, someone there, they're
[1:25:33] fighting something that they're fighting
[1:25:34] for. What are you fighting for? Figure
[1:25:37] that out. Why are you here this morning?
[1:25:40] You're fighting the devil. You You're
[1:25:43] showing God what side you're on.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Number one, right? Just like that blind
[1:25:47] was blind and a blind lady and so forth
[1:25:49] or deaf, I think, whatever it was. Or
[1:25:51] she's really severely disabled. They
[1:25:53] say, "What? What do you go to church
[1:25:54] for? He said, "Well, you know, nothing
[1:25:55] else, I always want to show the devil
[1:25:57] what side I'm on." Amen.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; I might not get a lot out of it, bear,
[1:26:01] but I'm just letting you know. That's
[1:26:02] why I'm coming. I'm showing God. I'm
[1:26:05] showing to the devil what side I'm on.
[1:26:07] And this is the side I'm on. I'm on the
[1:26:09] right side of prophecy. I'm on the right
[1:26:11] side of the book. And I believe it. I
[1:26:13] can say amen to it.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Look at this. Now,
[1:26:21] pick up that sword. You see, you're
[1:26:23] commanded, you have a sword. You're
[1:26:24] commanded to not only take it out of the
[1:26:26] sheath, but you actually commanded to
[1:26:28] use that sword. And God's given you that
[1:26:30] sword for a specific time and for a
[1:26:32] specific reason for your life. Amen.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Each one of us has it. Jesus used it
[1:26:37] against the devil, right?
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; And it was absolutely perfect. So if
[1:26:40] he's still God used the sword and it
[1:26:42] worked for him in his day, and if he's
[1:26:44] given you that sword, what do you think
[1:26:46] it'll do for your life?
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Think of this now.
[1:26:53] Brother Bam talked many times
[1:26:56] about that story.
[1:26:58] He said the Jefferson fire uh
[1:27:00] Jeffersonville Fire Department would
[1:27:01] come and he says there's a big fire one
[1:27:02] day and he says they come out and they
[1:27:03] How many knows that story?
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Jefferson fire. All right. He said he
[1:27:07] comes out and he says, you know, he says
[1:27:08] they come out and all the men are there
[1:27:09] and the captain comes out and he says,
[1:27:11] you know, squirt a little water over
[1:27:12] here, boys. Squirt a little water over
[1:27:13] here. And he looks over squirt a little
[1:27:15] water over here. He says there a bunch
[1:27:17] of a bunch of amateurs. He said, "Here
[1:27:18] comes a Louisville fire department up
[1:27:21] banging down, clanging down." And he
[1:27:23] comes out and here comes He says, "Who
[1:27:24] else but the chief captain himself." He
[1:27:27] comes and he steps on the ladder. He
[1:27:29] takes an axe. He throws it through the
[1:27:31] window and he says, "Come on, boys." He
[1:27:34] didn't say, "Go on, boys." He led by
[1:27:38] example. That's what Christ came to do.
[1:27:40] He came to pave the way for us so we can
[1:27:43] access all those promises in God's word.
[1:27:47] He didn't say go on boys. He said come
[1:27:49] and follow me.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Come on boys.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Come on girls.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Are you going to follow me?
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, it may be tough. It may be little.
[1:28:01] You may have some un unanswered
[1:28:02] questions over here and over here. You
[1:28:04] may not see what's around the corner,
[1:28:05] but I've already made the way. Just
[1:28:07] follow my way and I will guarantee you.
[1:28:10] I will promise to you eternal life.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Just follow my path.
[1:28:17] Come on, boys.
[1:28:19] Think of this now.
[1:28:23] Look what brother says. I like a man of
[1:28:25] vision. I like I like a people that's
[1:28:28] got something they're fighting for.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Not just lay around. Well, whatever
[1:28:34] comes along, that'll be all right. Oh,
[1:28:35] be up and at it. And Lincoln never again
[1:28:38] let his education stand in the way. You
[1:28:40] may say, I got 10 degrees. I got one
[1:28:42] degree. I may not even finish high
[1:28:43] school. Fine. I didn't either. Yeah, I'd
[1:28:45] be considered just like a low life in in
[1:28:47] today's world. But that really doesn't
[1:28:48] matter in so many aspects of our life.
[1:28:50] It's your your relationship with Christ.
[1:28:52] Get that right first and God will lead
[1:28:55] you what you need to do. Amen. If it's
[1:28:56] education, no, whatever it is, just
[1:28:59] commit your ways to God.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:03] Some I think every Christian ought to be
[1:29:05] that way. Find your purpose and go do
[1:29:07] it.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Wow. Every member of this chapter, not
[1:29:11] just, well, we have a breakfast once a
[1:29:12] month. That isn't it. or once every
[1:29:14] Saturday. Have a purpose in life,
[1:29:16] something you're going to do. God has
[1:29:18] placed you here. Let's do something
[1:29:21] about it.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Every member, oh, here it is. Every
[1:29:25] member of every church.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; That includes all of us.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; All in Edmonton, all in Calvary, all in
[1:29:33] Saskatchewan, includes every member of
[1:29:35] every body. If God took the time to save
[1:29:37] you, God's going to take the time to
[1:29:40] keep you. And God had a purpose for you.
[1:29:42] That's why he saved you. Not for you to
[1:29:44] sit around and do nothing. But God's got
[1:29:46] a plan for you. He says, "I want you to
[1:29:48] build up my body. You're part of the
[1:29:50] body. You've got a purpose. So go find
[1:29:52] your purpose and go do your purpose."
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:58] God just don't waste time saving people.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Think of it. What kind of a God would
[1:30:02] that be?
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; He just saves them. Okay, whatever.
[1:30:05] Yeah, okay. Go, go sit down. You have to
[1:30:06] wait for the rapture.
[1:30:08] Come on. I'm not saying this in an
[1:30:10] illegalistic way. We got to work. That
[1:30:12] has nothing to do with it. But you know,
[1:30:13] friends, that's the difference. So when
[1:30:14] you become a Christian, you don't look
[1:30:16] at it in a legalist way. Well, I better
[1:30:18] come to church because you know what?
[1:30:19] What will so and so think? Well, you
[1:30:21] know what? Well, it's just the right
[1:30:22] thing to do, so I I better do it. You
[1:30:24] know, you know, I should give to this
[1:30:26] person because it's the right thing to
[1:30:28] do cuz I'm a Christian. You see, a
[1:30:30] legalistic way, you know, brother said
[1:30:32] justice comes naturally from your heart.
[1:30:35] You do that and when you see what the
[1:30:38] bridge created for you to bring you back
[1:30:40] into fellowship, someone just emanates
[1:30:42] from you. I just do this cuz I want to
[1:30:45] show my appreciation to God for what he
[1:30:48] did for me. And I'm just doing this from
[1:30:49] my heart.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; There's the difference.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; There's the difference. See, I don't
[1:30:54] want to live a legalistic life. I don't
[1:30:57] have to do nothing for my salvation. God
[1:30:58] says it's a free gift.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; I have to work for it. I have to keep
[1:31:02] working for it to keep it. Once you're
[1:31:04] saved, you're saved.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; See, brother also talks I'm getting off
[1:31:09] track here, but I hope this is okay. He
[1:31:11] he talks about he talks about
[1:31:12] inheritance, though.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; You know that.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; You see, you see, depending on on what
[1:31:18] kind of life you live, if you're saved
[1:31:20] and God truly saved here, you're going,
[1:31:22] you have eternal life. Once you're
[1:31:23] saved, it's a complete work. It's done.
[1:31:25] You received it. You're on your way. But
[1:31:28] between here and here lies your
[1:31:31] inheritance.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. What kind of inheritance do you
[1:31:34] want up there?
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Well, you know, Brother Bren, I don't
[1:31:37] need a gold house and all these things.
[1:31:39] Oh, but but what about your family?
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; You realize that's part of your
[1:31:43] inheritance?
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, so that makes it a lot more
[1:31:48] important now. My Oh, yeah. You mean
[1:31:50] through my right decisions and my good
[1:31:52] living and helping out and and doing
[1:31:54] what I can and so forth and living on
[1:31:56] example Christ, you mean I can actually
[1:31:58] have inheritance and and get an
[1:32:00] inheritance in my family? Oh yeah, you
[1:32:02] can. You go look that up. I wish we had
[1:32:04] time. We'd go into it. But think of this
[1:32:06] now. Let's keep going. I I got off track
[1:32:08] here. But so here here he goes here now.
[1:32:10] So the John Bradfield, what he did is he
[1:32:12] came he he couldn't say yes or no to the
[1:32:14] bridge. He said, "I got to go test them
[1:32:15] myself." That's a very good thing for
[1:32:17] you to do. You see many critics in this
[1:32:18] day. Wow. This person over here, this
[1:32:20] group over here, this denomination over
[1:32:21] here, all these things, all these people
[1:32:23] that did a bunch of hypocrites, so
[1:32:24] forth. Why don't you go find out for
[1:32:25] yourself?
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother says, "Go do that." That's
[1:32:28] the best thing he said Nathaniel did.
[1:32:30] says he went and saw for himself if it
[1:32:32] was the truth or not. So he came and
[1:32:34] tested the soil and he said he looked at
[1:32:36] it and he came to the conclusion. He
[1:32:38] says I will build that bridge.
[1:32:42] He says I'll build that bridge.
[1:32:45] Christ oh keep your thing spiritual
[1:32:48] thinking caps on here.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Christ looked at you and he looked at
[1:32:52] you right down through time and he
[1:32:54] looked at your very being, your very
[1:32:56] soul, your very heart. He looked at all
[1:32:58] mankind
[1:33:00] and he says, "Is it worth to suffer so
[1:33:03] much for them? Is it worth it?" He had
[1:33:07] to ask that. He had to answer that
[1:33:08] question. You know that.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Is this worth it? What I got to suffer
[1:33:13] for them? Is it worth it?
[1:33:16] Oh my. He said, "I see the great gulf,
[1:33:19] the great chasm, and I see how sinful
[1:33:22] they are." and he counted up the cost
[1:33:25] and he realized how how incredibly hard
[1:33:29] this was going to be. And the most
[1:33:30] sweetest the most important words, the
[1:33:33] greatest words you'll ever hear in your
[1:33:35] life came out of his mouth.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; He says, "I will build that bridge."
[1:33:44] Amen.
[1:33:45] I will build that bridge. I will be the
[1:33:48] goto. I will be the go-between between
[1:33:51] man and God.
[1:33:53] Amen. I will restore fellowship. I'll
[1:33:56] restore that relationship. I will be
[1:33:59] that chasm between law and grace.
[1:34:05] Now, we're talking about that bridge.
[1:34:06] Just remember John Bradfield's
[1:34:08] reputation was at stake.
[1:34:11] Christ's reputation was at stake. Amen.
[1:34:14] every there said there therefore every
[1:34:16] bolt and every piece was tested before
[1:34:19] went into building that bridge. He said
[1:34:22] but the most critical every a magnet get
[1:34:24] this he had to have he put a magnet on
[1:34:26] every single bolt that went in to make
[1:34:28] sure it was a steel bolt. Every bolt
[1:34:33] think of that now how many thousands of
[1:34:34] bolts he tested every single one of
[1:34:36] them. He didn't do a halfways job
[1:34:38] friends. Christ when he came didn't do a
[1:34:40] halfways job. He didn't go
[1:34:42] half-heartedly. He looked at you and he
[1:34:45] looked at me and with his full heart and
[1:34:46] with full confidence looked and realized
[1:34:48] he said, "I will die for mankind because
[1:34:51] I love them before they first loved me."
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, I got to quit here right aways. I
[1:34:59] don't like to be one of those
[1:34:59] long-winded preachers. You know, I get I
[1:35:02] keep people for about 45 minutes to an
[1:35:03] hour. You know, that's just maybe it's a
[1:35:05] psychological thing, but you know,
[1:35:06] unless you really got on people
[1:35:08] something they're very interested in,
[1:35:09] but you know, in general, we're human
[1:35:11] beings, right? We get tired. But I'm
[1:35:14] almost done here. Now think of this. Now
[1:35:15] he say he so he dug and he dug and he
[1:35:18] dug until he found that foundation. And
[1:35:21] that's why when he looked at the at the
[1:35:23] soil he realized that way beyond that
[1:35:26] quickening sand there laid a foundation
[1:35:28] there. And if he just dug far enough and
[1:35:31] long enough he's going to come to a
[1:35:33] solid foundation. and friends and you
[1:35:35] may be in this life. You might be
[1:35:37] digging and digging and digging and it
[1:35:40] doesn't seem like you're getting
[1:35:41] anywhere. You're digging through all the
[1:35:42] quicksand in your life and the quick
[1:35:44] sand in your life. But one day that
[1:35:46] quickening sand, if you keep digging,
[1:35:47] will turn into a quickening power and
[1:35:50] you'll come and you'll reach that
[1:35:52] foundation, Christ Jesus. And you can
[1:35:54] come to that and you can build your life
[1:35:57] upon that foundation.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Think of this now.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Wow. How God did that? Brother says,
[1:36:05] "When between the old New Testament, he
[1:36:06] spanned his plan of salvation and
[1:36:08] hoisted up an endgth hill. It was
[1:36:11] timeested."
[1:36:13] Oh yeah. And that bridge is still there
[1:36:14] today.
[1:36:17] Years, hundred years later, that bridge
[1:36:19] is still good. People are still using
[1:36:21] that bridge. It still is working.
[1:36:23] Everything that he went to putting into
[1:36:25] that bridge is still today. Let me tell
[1:36:27] you something, friends. 2,000 years ago
[1:36:29] when Christ died, that was great. But
[1:36:31] it's still in effect today.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:36:36] Look at this now.
[1:36:38] Just a little more. Did you notice
[1:36:42] he couldn't die on earth and he couldn't
[1:36:44] die in heaven. Oh, so what was So he was
[1:36:48] the bridge between. See, that's why he
[1:36:50] died between the heavens and the earth.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a beautiful type.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; That's why he went to the cross.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; That's why he wasn't on earth and he
[1:37:00] wasn't in heaven. Who's the gap
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; between man on earth and a god in
[1:37:05] heaven?
[1:37:07] Oh my
[1:37:09] think of this now.
[1:37:12] We become
[1:37:14] part of you as we come become part of
[1:37:16] that bridge. Do you realize that?
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Every bolt
[1:37:22] of your bridge will be tested as well.
[1:37:25] You see, because you're going to be a
[1:37:26] time tested true Christian. You see,
[1:37:29] because you're we're coming down to some
[1:37:30] harder times. I don't mean to scare you
[1:37:32] and this is just the reality of it.
[1:37:34] You're going to be coming through some
[1:37:35] harder times and you and all these
[1:37:37] things. Yeah. Just like a soldier when
[1:37:38] he's going through training. Brother M
[1:37:40] talks about that man and the sixcond
[1:37:41] smith whatever his trainer and he said
[1:37:43] just just hammer me out and he knocked
[1:37:46] him out of the ring. Says K like you
[1:37:48] know when he was a noticeably heavier
[1:37:49] him says why have you been so tough on
[1:37:51] me? Just being so tough on me. He's like
[1:37:53] you don't have to like kill me early. He
[1:37:54] says he says you may not appreciate it
[1:37:56] now. He says, "But you wait till you get
[1:37:58] into that ring." And he says, "Your body
[1:38:00] can take a lick and you'll keep the
[1:38:01] blood keep flowing." And he says, "I
[1:38:03] found out he was very right when I got
[1:38:05] into the ring." And that's what Christ
[1:38:07] is doing. Christ is molding your life
[1:38:09] and putting you through trials. Why?
[1:38:10] Because you have to be able to be tested
[1:38:12] to go into the great rapture.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; I don't want to live a soft, easy life
[1:38:17] and never get trials, never get test.
[1:38:19] What kind of character we would have,
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Oh my. But just as God gives them. I
[1:38:27] don't love trials. That's why I hate
[1:38:29] trials. Hate them.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; Never want them. God, give me more
[1:38:32] trials. Please. I guarantee those never
[1:38:34] come out of your mouth. God, just please
[1:38:37] give me suffering. No. No. I don't want
[1:38:41] it. But I realize inside something says,
[1:38:44] "But even so, whatever it is, Lord, you
[1:38:46] need to me to get ready for the rapture.
[1:38:50] Please
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; allow me to go through it so I'm ready
[1:38:54] for that day.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Think of this. We'll finish up here.
[1:39:03] It's your fault I'm preaching so long by
[1:39:05] the way.
[1:39:08] I feel good. He said, you see, was a see
[1:39:12] you see the bridge was there to bridge
[1:39:14] mankind. But do you realize that bridge
[1:39:16] between? See, God needed a bridge to be
[1:39:19] able to bless his children with certain
[1:39:21] things. And he needed some chasm. He
[1:39:24] needed a chasm built in between. He
[1:39:26] needed something going in between. So
[1:39:27] now, brother Ram says is that when God
[1:39:30] br Jesus Christ came and and created
[1:39:32] that chasm or created that bridge
[1:39:34] between the two, he says now he says God
[1:39:36] could flow all his blessings, all his
[1:39:39] goodness, all the gifts and he went and
[1:39:42] sent down gifts to man. Do you realize
[1:39:46] all the gifts that we have in the body
[1:39:47] of Christ, it was because of Christ?
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Brother says he's just rolled them down
[1:39:52] the bridge right to mankind. Rolled them
[1:39:53] down the bridge. It's all through Jesus
[1:39:56] Christ.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh yeah.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; And that's who gets the glory. It's not
[1:39:59] mankind gets the glory. No one else
[1:40:01] does. It's Jesus Christ that gets the
[1:40:04] glory in every one of our lives. It's
[1:40:07] not about us, friends. Never has been.
[1:40:09] It's not about me. I don't preach to
[1:40:13] show that I'm saved. And I don't preach
[1:40:15] because God I preach because I'm called.
[1:40:18] Yes, I feel that way. But you know, if I
[1:40:20] wouldn't preach, brother says, I never
[1:40:21] preach another sermon in my life. I'd
[1:40:23] still be saved.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Really? Oh.
[1:40:26] See, because you're saved, you're saved.
[1:40:27] You're saved when you're there. When
[1:40:28] you've come, God's provided way. He
[1:40:31] says, "But I do it because I love him."
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; And that's what it is. It becomes a love
[1:40:36] relationship between you and Christ. I
[1:40:39] do it because I want to do something for
[1:40:41] the kingdom of God and I want to glorify
[1:40:43] him. And if God so choose me for this,
[1:40:45] great. What does he choose you to do to
[1:40:47] glorify him? He is looking at your life
[1:40:50] in particular. He's calling out your
[1:40:52] name and saying, "Son, daughter, I want
[1:40:54] to use you to glorify my name."
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; What a privilege.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; What an honor
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; that you are sitting here this morning
[1:41:03] and can see through the eyes of
[1:41:04] Revelation that God wants to use you for
[1:41:07] something in this last day.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; That That's humbling, isn't it?
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; How could we ever turn that down?
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Think of that. How could we ever get so
[1:41:21] carnal in our mind and or or so
[1:41:23] discouraged in our mind to think, "Oh,
[1:41:24] God's got no purpose for me and I'm just
[1:41:26] so and so and I don't got any talents. I
[1:41:28] don't got anything." All God wants is
[1:41:30] your heart. It's all he wants. When you
[1:41:33] think you can do something, you just
[1:41:35] better back right up.
[1:41:37] I don't think I can preach. I can't
[1:41:39] preach. I can't. But one thing I can do
[1:41:41] is say, "God, you can do it. If I just
[1:41:43] get myself out of the way and you speak
[1:41:45] to your children, that's fine. And if
[1:41:47] you want to use me for that, but I got
[1:41:48] no talents. I got no gifts to offer you.
[1:41:51] All I can offer you is a surrender
[1:41:53] being. Say, "God, you take over. You do
[1:41:55] it. And you get the glory." No man gets
[1:41:58] glory.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; As soon as you do, just remember one
[1:42:01] thing. You're going downhill.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:42:07] And ask the musicians to come up. Come
[1:42:09] on. We're going to be done here.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Remember, we're still on a holiday, you
[1:42:13] know.
[1:42:16] We're in holiday mode, right?
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Think of this. Now, I want to something
[1:42:24] I just got last night. I want to insert
[1:42:26] this because a lot of times people when
[1:42:28] they look at Calvary and they look what
[1:42:29] it did, but here's a here's really the
[1:42:31] essential reality of what Calvary did.
[1:42:35] You see the atonement, what the
[1:42:36] atonement did for you. You see, there's
[1:42:38] three parts here and they're all so
[1:42:40] beautiful.
[1:42:43] Where do you want to play? You're Peter,
[1:42:44] aren't you? Peter. God bless you. Nice
[1:42:48] to see you. I like I know him. I know
[1:42:50] him. He's like, "Yeah, brother Peter
[1:42:51] Dirkson. God richly bless you. So nice
[1:42:54] to see you again." Amen.
[1:42:56] Yeah. Just play whatever you feel in
[1:42:57] your heart, brother. Think of this now.
[1:42:59] There's three beautiful parts to it. The
[1:43:02] first one is expeation. You see, when
[1:43:05] God died at Cal Christ died at Calvary,
[1:43:08] he said there's a first part. He said,
[1:43:10] "Was it the experation part?" You think
[1:43:11] experation? What was that? What is that?
[1:43:14] Expeation means to pay for the wrong
[1:43:17] that has been done. You see, and that's
[1:43:20] what Christ came to do was to pay for
[1:43:22] all the wrong that you had done. All the
[1:43:24] wrong that all of mankind had done and
[1:43:27] to absolutely pay pay the debt
[1:43:29] unconditionally and completely wipe it.
[1:43:33] That was the experation part. And Christ
[1:43:35] came to do that for you.
[1:43:39] That's what a good Freddy Friday
[1:43:40] represented and paid for your sins
[1:43:44] individually,
[1:43:46] took them upon himself and went to
[1:43:48] Calvary. That's why the That's why you
[1:43:49] can say that debt is paid and and you we
[1:43:51] sing all those songs and the debt's been
[1:43:53] paid and that that great debt to mankind
[1:43:56] and all those things and and my and me
[1:43:58] personally all the sins that I remember
[1:44:00] I did back in here and and over here and
[1:44:03] over here and over here and every debt
[1:44:06] every sin that I ever committed and all
[1:44:08] the iniquity I committed. It's all
[1:44:10] forgiven me. If you've come, he's
[1:44:12] provided way and repented of it. It's
[1:44:16] all forgiven. And you think, "Wonderful,
[1:44:18] brother Brent. Wonderful." And you know
[1:44:20] what? It feels so good to be justified,
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; doesn't it?
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; And there's so many people, I'll just go
[1:44:27] one step further. There's so many people
[1:44:28] in this world that have experienced that
[1:44:30] justification. And it feels really good
[1:44:32] to get that,000bs off your shoulders.
[1:44:35] But I tell you what, it goes a little
[1:44:37] bit further than that, though, too.
[1:44:40] It's not justification, although
[1:44:42] wonderful as it as it as it feels.
[1:44:45] Here's the next part.
[1:44:51] I want to give an example actually.
[1:44:55] Let's say brother Moses
[1:44:58] say brother Moses forward my car.
[1:45:03] Moses, brother Brent, I need a car for a
[1:45:05] for a for a couple days or whatever. All
[1:45:06] right, no problem. Here's the keys,
[1:45:08] brother Mo. All right, takes it away.
[1:45:11] don't hear from him for a while. And
[1:45:14] after a week or two, whatever, or two
[1:45:16] weeks later, he comes back and said,
[1:45:17] "Here's your car back." Okay. I look at
[1:45:19] it. He, "Oh, by the way, um, I got into
[1:45:23] an accident."
[1:45:25] But, um, but I tell you what, I'll tell
[1:45:27] you what. I went to the body shop and I
[1:45:28] got all the parts, all the right parts,
[1:45:30] everything. Everything's all fine. You
[1:45:31] look Look at it. It's all It's all good.
[1:45:33] It's all good. Okay, that's good. See,
[1:45:35] that's what experation did. It actually
[1:45:38] took something and it actually took away
[1:45:40] all the wrong and replace that and say
[1:45:42] all the sin's gone, all it's gone and so
[1:45:45] forth and now you have your own carpet.
[1:45:46] But you know what? There had to be
[1:45:47] another step with Christ. God paid the
[1:45:50] whole debt. But just because brother Mo
[1:45:53] made the car back and paid that debt and
[1:45:55] made everything back, that doesn't
[1:45:57] necessarily mean I've got a proper
[1:45:58] relationship back. You see, I really
[1:46:01] appreciated brother Mo when he when he
[1:46:03] took my car. We had a good relationship.
[1:46:05] when he comes back, my relationship
[1:46:07] might not be the same, would it? Well,
[1:46:09] yeah, but I forgive you, but our
[1:46:12] relationships may be a little different.
[1:46:14] Like, but emoji, you never told me like,
[1:46:16] you know, I'm sorry, but like it's, you
[1:46:19] know, it's going to take a little bit
[1:46:20] here to restore the relationship.
[1:46:24] You see where I'm going with this? You
[1:46:25] see when Christ in order for Christ to
[1:46:28] come back to the relig original
[1:46:30] relationship with Adam in the Garden of
[1:46:32] Eden, he actually had the had to have
[1:46:34] the ability to forget every sin that you
[1:46:39] ever have create committed or ever will
[1:46:41] commit. God had to actually completely
[1:46:44] forget that he ever committed a sin. And
[1:46:47] if I never remember, brother Mo did
[1:46:49] that, my relationship is just the way
[1:46:50] it's always been. I'm no big deal. I
[1:46:52] don't remember anything. I don't
[1:46:54] remember an axle that you got in my car
[1:46:55] because but we have the ability to
[1:46:57] remember but Christ at Calvary took upon
[1:47:00] himself the ability to forget every sin
[1:47:04] that you ever have committed or brother
[1:47:06] says ever will commit.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; Oh
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; what do you mean ever will commit?
[1:47:14] That's what Calvary did. Not just the
[1:47:16] past but it covers your future too.
[1:47:20] every sin that you will commit.
[1:47:24] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Yeah, it's
[1:47:27] already forgiven.
[1:47:29] So, what do I have to do? You just have
[1:47:30] to repent when it comes up. When you
[1:47:32] sin, say, "God, I forgive you." He says,
[1:47:34] "It's already paid for. I knew you were
[1:47:36] going to do it. I knew you're going to
[1:47:38] ask for repentance. It's already
[1:47:39] forgiven and right to your final
[1:47:42] destination."
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; See how powerful it is to be able to
[1:47:46] forget something when you did somebody
[1:47:48] wrong. Don't you wish you you you have
[1:47:50] regrets in your life? I wish I would
[1:47:52] have said that to so and so. I wish I
[1:47:54] would have done this terrible thing in
[1:47:55] my life. Now imagine if that individual
[1:47:58] completely forgot about it. Would it
[1:48:00] make you feel good?
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; And they treat you like nothing ever
[1:48:04] happened. Oh, wouldn't that feel good?
[1:48:06] That's the same thing Christ did with
[1:48:07] you. That's the same way Christ looks at
[1:48:09] you today. Like you never sinned, you
[1:48:12] never committed a sin. You never will
[1:48:14] commit a sin. You're perfect, justified
[1:48:17] under the perfect blood of Calvary in
[1:48:19] his sight.
[1:48:21] Amen. Oh my. And what's the last part?
[1:48:25] Just what we read. Reconciliation.
[1:48:28] That's putting expeation
[1:48:30] and putting propitiation together to
[1:48:33] form a full reconciliation, a full
[1:48:37] relationship restored.
[1:48:42] You see what that bridge did?
[1:48:44] did so much.
[1:48:47] All you ever did, h how could you turn
[1:48:49] them down? How could people turn them
[1:48:51] down in this day when they realize the
[1:48:54] price that was paid and all the things
[1:48:56] that happened in my life and they're all
[1:48:59] completely forgotten and forgiven and
[1:49:02] the sea of God forget God's
[1:49:03] forgetfulness. And if Satan ever tries
[1:49:05] to bring that up and tries to bring up
[1:49:07] your old sin, just put a sign on that in
[1:49:09] the sea and say, "No fishing allowed.
[1:49:12] You may have I may have done this but
[1:49:14] God can't remember it. So if you
[1:49:16] remember it that's fine but my God
[1:49:18] that's perfect can't remember it. I'm
[1:49:19] not trying to remember it. It's from the
[1:49:21] sea of his forgetfulness.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all stand. Let's all stand.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:49:39] Think of this now.
[1:49:41] Let's be a bridge builder.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Do you realize God predestinated you to
[1:49:46] be a bridge builder, too?
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; How do you build bridges in your day?
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; What's your name again, sir? God bless
[1:49:54] you, brother Andrew. I don't know you,
[1:49:55] but God bless you. I sure love you. I
[1:49:56] appreciate you, buddy. You just serve
[1:49:58] the Lord with all your heart. You do
[1:50:00] what God's promised and wanted you to do
[1:50:02] in this last day. Amen. God bless you.
[1:50:05] You go to the other churches, too. Say,
[1:50:08] "God bless you, brother."
[1:50:10] You build those bridges and you keep
[1:50:13] those bridges built.
[1:50:15] Just remember the body doesn't have any
[1:50:17] shism in it.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; So if you truly believe someone's in the
[1:50:20] body of Christ,
[1:50:22] you be the bridge builder as well. So we
[1:50:25] love you guys who are praying for you
[1:50:27] and you see a need in another church
[1:50:28] might not be in your own church. Let's
[1:50:29] go a little bit further friends and need
[1:50:31] another church. Say, "Oh, you know
[1:50:33] what?" Or send a text or you might do
[1:50:35] something, say, "I heard you going
[1:50:36] through such and such." Just to let you
[1:50:37] know our church, we're praying for you
[1:50:39] guys.
[1:50:40] Wow. I mean, you can be a bridge
[1:50:42] builder. Sure you can.
[1:50:46] Let's be that.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Let's be the bridge builder that Christ
[1:50:50] wants us to be.
[1:50:53] Let's sing a couple songs. All right.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; You sing a couple songs.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; You know that song,
[1:51:02] Won't We Have a Time.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; You know that song, Key of A. You know
[1:51:05] key of A is the Canadian key, right?
[1:51:08] Amen.
[1:51:10] Won't we have a time? Oh, we'll have a
[1:51:13] time. All because of that bridge. Oh,
[1:51:15] won't we have a time? When we get over
[1:51:19] yonder, won't we have a time? Oh, when
[1:51:22] we get over yonder, won't we have a

[1:51:55] more dying there. There. When we get
[1:51:58] over yonder, there'll be no dying there.
[1:52:02] When we get over yonder, there'll be no
[1:52:06] dying there. When we get over yonder
[1:52:12] see our loved ones there.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, and we'll see our loved ones there.
[1:52:17] Oh, when we get over yonder, we'll see
[1:52:21] our loved ones there. When we get over
[1:52:24] yonder, we'll see our loved ones there.
[1:52:28] When we get over yonder. Oh, won't we
[1:52:32] have a time?
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Won't we have a time? Yes. Won't we have
[1:52:37] a time? Oh, when we get over yonder,
[1:52:41] won't we have a time?
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; When we get over yonder, won't we have a
[1:52:47] time? Oh, when we get over yonder.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's that Holy Ghost and fire. Oh,

[1:52:58] it's keeping me alive. It's keeping me

[1:53:33] it's all over me and it's all over me
[1:53:37] and it's keeping me alive. Amen. It's
[1:53:42] keeping us alive. Me alive. Oh, it's all

[1:56:49] God bless. Go all the glory to God.
[1:56:52] Amen.
[1:56:53] May God bless his servant. We really
[1:56:55] enjoyed it. It was It was good. It was
[1:56:57] marvelous. We thank God for the bridge.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; If he didn't come, if he didn't come, if
[1:57:03] we didn't have that bridge, where will
[1:57:05] we be?
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Yes. He represented that cross. We were
[1:57:10] right here at the bottom
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; and he's right here on the top. If we
[1:57:15] didn't have that bridge,
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; where would we be
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; still here? Nothing. No way to go up.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; But he had to come down to our level
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; to bring us up to his level.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; That's God's grace in our life.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Why would you reject that? Why would you
[1:57:35] reject that grace? It doesn't condemn
[1:57:38] you. Sometimes we condemn oursel because
[1:57:40] we reject to hang on that bridge to
[1:57:43] cross over. But this morning it has been
[1:57:47] so well preached that God I want to
[1:57:50] cross that bridge. I want to walk with
[1:57:52] you on that bridge. Keep me near the
[1:57:55] cross. Keep me near you, Lord. Keep near
[1:57:58] me. Let's sing that. Near the cross.
[1:58:07] Jesus,
[1:58:09] keep me near the cross.
[1:58:15] There a preious
[1:58:19] fountain
[1:58:22] free to all. A healing
[1:58:27] stream
[1:58:29] flows from Calary's
[1:58:33] mountain.
[1:58:36] In the cross,
[1:58:40] in the cross
[1:58:43] be my glory
[1:58:47] ever
[1:58:50] till my rapture
[1:58:54] soul shall shall find
[1:58:57] the rest beyond
[1:59:00] the river.
[1:59:05] Here the cross such trembling
[1:59:10] soul
[1:59:12] love and mercy
[1:59:15] found
[1:59:17] me.
[1:59:19] There the bright
[1:59:22] and morning
[1:59:24] star
[1:59:26] shed it beams around
[1:59:31] me.
[1:59:33] In the cross
[1:59:37] in the cross
[1:59:40] be my glory
[1:59:44] ever
[1:59:47] till my raptured
[1:59:51] soul soul shall find
[1:59:54] rest beyond
[1:59:57] the Heaven
[2:00:02] near the cross. Oh lamb of God,
[2:00:09] bring it seen before
[2:00:14] me. Is that your prayer? Help me walk
[2:00:18] from day to day
[2:00:23] with it shadows
[2:00:26] over
[2:00:27] me.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Give me Lord
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; in the cross.
[2:00:33] In the cross
[2:00:36] be my glory
[2:00:40] ever.
[2:00:43] In my rapur
[2:00:47] soul shall find the rest beyond
[2:00:53] the river
[2:00:57] near the cross our watch and wait.
[2:01:04] Oh, bring trusting
[2:01:08] ever
[2:01:11] till I reach the golden golden strength.
[2:01:18] Just beyond
[2:01:20] the
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you for the bridge. Thank you for
[2:01:23] the bridge in the cross.

[2:01:41] soul shall shall find the rest beyond

[2:01:58] be my glory
[2:02:02] ever.
[2:02:05] Take my rapture soul.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; Soul shall find
[2:02:12] the rest beyond
[2:02:15] the river.
[2:02:18] As the music is playing softly, let's
[2:02:21] just pray to him and thank him for the
[2:02:23] bridge for what he has done for us. Lord
[2:02:26] Lord, just to stay at the cross. That's
[2:02:29] where I want Lord to find my rest. Oh
[2:02:32] father, we thank you Lord this morning
[2:02:34] Jesus Christ for that bridge. We thank
[2:02:36] you father Lord where Lord there was no
[2:02:39] hope. No one could could take my place.
[2:02:42] No one could save. Oh father I could
[2:02:44] bridge that. I could bring that bridge
[2:02:46] between the chasm. But you accept it.
[2:02:49] You planned it for it. Lord, before the
[2:02:51] foundation of the world, Father, you
[2:02:53] plan it, planned it for eternity to
[2:02:56] eternity. And you put my name in the
[2:02:58] lamb's book of life, the lambs was laid
[2:03:01] before the foundation of the world
[2:03:03] already in your plan, in your mind.
[2:03:05] Father, you knew that it will come that
[2:03:08] you'll bring that bridge, Lord. You'll
[2:03:10] you'll make Lord, that reparation
[2:03:12] between the two chasm, Lord, between the
[2:03:14] two sides. Oh father, we thank you,
[2:03:17] Lord. We thank you for that bridge. We
[2:03:19] thank you for making that plan for us to
[2:03:21] make us part of the plan of redemption.
[2:03:24] Lord, that you died on our behalf, Lord
[2:03:26] Jesus Christ. I know my redeemer lives.
[2:03:29] I know. I know that I shall see him.
[2:03:32] Even though the scheme worms destroy
[2:03:34] this body. I know my redeemer shall
[2:03:37] raise me up. Oh, that job could have
[2:03:39] that revelation. But now you have made
[2:03:42] it so real to us, Father. Lord, we
[2:03:44] desire to be having our own Calvary this
[2:03:47] morning. This father Father, we thank
[2:03:49] you for the word that came. We desire to
[2:03:51] be identified to that as well, Father.
[2:03:54] As the brother put it so nicely, we
[2:03:56] desire to be as well bridge repairers,
[2:03:59] Lord. Father, in our families, in our
[2:04:01] friendship, Lord, may you take the
[2:04:03] malice. May you take, Father, Lord, the
[2:04:05] unforgiving spirit or anything, Father,
[2:04:07] that is not of yours. As we remember
[2:04:10] Calvary, Lord, we desire, Lord, to die
[2:04:12] ourself, to die to ourselves more and
[2:04:15] more, to become more humble, Lord, to
[2:04:17] have that humble spirit, Lord. Oh,
[2:04:20] Father, that we can live for others as
[2:04:22] well. Give us that love of Jesus Christ.
[2:04:25] the same love that you display towards
[2:04:27] us, Lord. Although we can't pay our own
[2:04:30] debt, we can't pay other people's debt.
[2:04:32] But Father, Lord, we desire to express
[2:04:35] our love back to you as because you
[2:04:37] loved us first. We desire to love you in
[2:04:40] return. Thank you once again, Father.
[2:04:42] Bless your people this morning. Thank
[2:04:44] you, Father, for your word. As we go as
[2:04:47] separate ways, Father, Lord, we desire
[2:04:48] to remember what we have heard. Remember
[2:04:51] also the needs among us, Father. Brother
[2:04:53] Luke Semin Lord thank you for restoring
[2:04:56] continue to restore him father continue
[2:04:59] to heal him completely. Remember brother
[2:05:01] Dan Father Lord as Lord the the price
[2:05:04] was already paid on Calvary. It's a
[2:05:06] finished work. Father, Lord Jesus
[2:05:08] Christ, we cannot put the blame on age.
[2:05:11] Father, we remember brother Dao in this
[2:05:13] age. Father, in the time of brother, he
[2:05:15] lived, Lord, beyond 90s and was still
[2:05:18] strong in the flesh. Father, you are
[2:05:20] still the same God today, Lord. We
[2:05:22] commit that request to you as well.
[2:05:24] Lord, remember brother remember brother
[2:05:29] Johnny. Oh Lord, as he's going through
[2:05:31] this this fight, Lord, Father, we we
[2:05:33] Lord, it's not his fight. It's your
[2:05:35] fight. Father, you have already
[2:05:36] conquered death. You already conquered
[2:05:38] sickness. You have already conquered
[2:05:40] cancer. Father, Lord, you are more than
[2:05:42] able to save him and touch him even this
[2:05:45] morning. Father, as we send our prayer
[2:05:47] to him, sending your word to his place,
[2:05:49] Father, where he is, Lord, we are here
[2:05:52] interceding for our loved ones. For
[2:05:54] those who don't know you yet, for those
[2:05:55] who are backsliding, for those who,
[2:05:57] Father, Lord, who who don't recognize
[2:06:00] the place where we are, Father, our
[2:06:01] children, our grandchildren, or Father,
[2:06:04] our husband, our wives, for those who
[2:06:06] have become lukewarm, Lord, we look at
[2:06:09] Calvary, Lord, where you pay the price,
[2:06:11] the bridge where you build that bridge
[2:06:13] for them as well, Father. Lord, remember
[2:06:15] them, Lord, as we are here this morning,
[2:06:18] Father, you are a merciful God. We love
[2:06:20] you. We appreciate you. Thank you once
