Sermon: “The Power of Transformation" on Wednesday, December 3rd, 2025 by Brother Moses Ndala
Summary
========
In this sermon, Brother Moses Ndala speaks on the power of transformation using Romans 12:1–2 as the foundation. Paul’s instructions—to present our bodies as a living sacrifice and to be transformed by the renewing of our minds—are emphasized as the basic and reasonable act of every believer. Brother Moses explains that Christians do not belong to themselves but to God, and that true worship involves surrendering our bodies, desires, and decisions so that God can have full pre-eminence. This transformation is not merely outward behavior or trying to “fit” into the Christian life, but an inner spiritual change that reshapes our desires and thinking into the mind of Christ (Philippians 2:5).

He continues by highlighting the teachings of Brother William Branham, particularly from Spiritual Food in Due Season and The Power of Transformation. Brother Branham taught that the age we live in requires rapturing faith, and that such faith only comes from receiving the revealed Word of God. Bro. Moses repeats the prophet's warning that believers must accumulate every testimony, every miracle, every experience with God, and hold them as present-day realities to build that rapturing faith. It is not enough to be merely saved or to have received the Holy Spirit; the believer must keep growing until the very mind and character of Christ are formed within.

To illustrate spiritual growth, Brother Moses uses Brother Branham’s examples of the tadpole becoming a frog and the worm becoming a butterfly—pictures taken from The Power of Transformation (W. Branham, 1965). Transformation happens from the inside, not by pressure from the outside. As the believer continues feeding on the Word, old habits, tempers, and weaknesses “drop off,” much like the tadpole...

If pressure made in the oceans were ink, it's it's not enough to fill God's love. And I was just thinking about that and and it's this life we live isn't enough. He has to take us out of a temporal world to put us into an eternity where his love will never end. And then it's still it's still not going to be fully expressed. So like we just have a finite understanding of what what God's love is. You are my [music] strength when I [singing] am weak. You are [music] the treure that [singing] I seek.

Jesus, [music] lamb of [singing] God, [music] worthy is your [singing and music] name. Sing one more song as the most he paid a debt. He [singing] paid a [music] debt. He did not. I owe a debt. I could not [singing] pay. I needed [music] someone to wash my sins away. And now I sing a brand new [music] song. Amazing grace. All [music and singing] day long. Christ Jesus made a debt that I [singing] could [music] never pay. &gt;&gt; He paid a [music] debt at Calary. [singing] He cleansed my soul [music] and he set me free.

Glory to his name. That's why we can come with joy and praising him and glorifying his name. Wonderful. Amen. I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ this evening. Good to be in the house of the Lord once again and uh good to see brother Lan again. God bless you and and he's always his fellow Jerry God bless you. [laughter] Good to have you. Wonderful.

Yes, [singing and music] I know he's coming back. I know [music] he's coming back [singing] for me and you. &gt;&gt; One day when I [singing] was lost, [music] he died upon the cross.

Thank God for the blood of Jesus Christ, the blood of the perfect lamb of God just for me. Amen. He died for me. Wonderful. Thank you musicians. Thank you Sister Wendy and Caleb. God bless you Richie and musicians and all of you. Good to be in the house of the Lord. I invite you to go to the word of God and Romans 12. I just speak for few minutes. I hope very few minutes. I just want to give you priority to prayer today. But um I hope I will not be carried away. I just I didn't prepare too many notes just to restrict myself a few minutes. But you will see. So I want to talk a little bit on the power of transformation. Uh Romans 12 verse one and two. The Bible says I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service. and be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Father, we thank you for your grace. We thank you, Father, for another opportunity, Lord, to be in your house, Father. the closest place we can get to heaven to be in the house of the Lord, Father, and have fellowship with you around the revealed worthy of the hour. Center of all would have loved to be in the time we are living in. Father, oh God, thank you for helping us to recognize the time and the message of our day. Father, Lord, we are getting closer for that moment of body change, Lord, and a rapture, Lord, but they're looking forward now, Lord. We take every step preciously Lord that as we walk with you have desire to have a closer walk with you father may you visit us once again this evening we thank you for your presence with special presence with a song service prayer father everything that was said and done to prepare us for this time a few words around the word of god and then go in prayer father be with us for the remainder of the service you know our needs father even before we present them to you already nailed Father, we just pray that you give us the right attitude as we approach to you, Father, Lord, and change our mind so that we can have your mind. We give you the glory and the honor. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. God bless you and have a seat. As I said, I just want to speak a little bit on the small thought of the power transformation, a little bit on the line of what we heard on Sunday, but just for a few minutes. As we go in prayer here, uh the Bible says, I'll repeat it again, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service as a basic service just to give our body to him. Lord, I give you my heart, I give you my body, I give you my mind as a reasonable service. The minimal thing as a Christian, God, I give you my whole being to you as a sacrifice. We don't belong to ourself. We belong to him. And we want him to have the full preminence on our lives. We don't want to have our own ideas, our own mind, our own directions, but we want his ideas, his directions, his will in our lives. So we want just Lord I want to sanctify the the part that we can do. We want to do our part. We want to sanctify oursel. We want to separate from unbelief. Want separate from anything that is not holy so that we can be accepted to him. Amen. as a as as a reasonable service just a minimal service that can be reasonable. That's what we want to give. Sanctify ourself, give ourselves to him so that he can have full control of our lives. The prophet says in spiritual food induces, he says faith is going to take more faith than ever was in any age for this has to be rapturing faith in the in the age that we are living in. We need rapturing faith. with the age where we must have rapturing faith for the rapturing grace for the rapture and also rapturing faith and rapturing faith requires faith comes by hearing and hearing of the word of God and see if we have to have rapturing faith means we need to have rapturing word amen and we have by God's grace received the revelation of the word of God with perfect vindication to give us rapturing faith amen so we need just to listen more to the word of God to get that rapturing faith says if you want we so we want to believe tonight in all that we have seen all that we have heard the word that we have heard preached the signs and wonders that we have seen done we want to you to accumulate all that together in your heart and consider it whether it is be God or not whatever we have heard whatever we have listened whatever we have seen the miracles and everything we should not put it just something of the past but we to accumulate all that and take it as from God in order to have rapturing faith. No because God has given us example in the word of God has given us example even in our life even experienced life that we have ourself all that we have to accumulate in order to have rapturing faith can't just put things in the past but we have to take everything as a reality in our lives the prophet says in the power of transformation and that what I just want to read quickly here and it says I thought that this was a beautiful thing for this group this morning what we done did he says and remember from verse one to verse two it says now and and is a conjunction as I understand be not confirmed confirmed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is the good what is that good and acceptable and perfect and will of God so he's not in other words he's saying the verse one and verse two are connected if you want to give God a reasonable service then you also need to be transformed Not only confirmed to the world, not confirmed to the world. We should not be confirmed to the world. It's elementary. We should not be confirmed to the world. We should not follow the world what the world is doing. But we should be transformed. But I would even say go a little bit further here. We should not even only get ourself limited to be confirmed to the word of God. I will explain myself. Just say no. I I'll just try to confirm myself or try to try try to to force myself in something. It is it it is good. It has one part. It is it is good to do that and we have to confirm but it should go more than that. Should be more than that. We should be transformed from the inside out. Our desire should be transformed. Amen. Our desire should be transformed. Our mind should be transformed. So it start with confirming but it goes more than confirming. It has to become a transformation. It is transformation from the inside out. And that what is trying to emphasize it that what we all want to do be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of our mind to do the perfect and acceptable will of God. So in order to do the perfect and acceptable will of God. We need to be transformed in our mind. We can't rely on our natural mind. We can't rely on our human mind. It has to be the mind of Christ. So God as God as my prayers God I want to be transformed in my mind. I want to be renewed in my mind more. I want I want to die more to myself so that I can have the mind of Christ. I can't rely on my own mind. I have the word has to wash me. The word has to to cleanse me. The words the word has to transform me. The Holy Spirit has to transform me from the inside. I WANT CHRIST to grow deeper to grow to have the preeminence in my life. I I don't I I don't want a baby Christ. I want a grownup Christ. I want to come TO THE FULL STATURE OF THE PERFECT MAN. AMEN. I want to be transformed really from the inside out completely in changing all my mind. &gt;&gt; So now we have seen we have says we have been saved as we are and that we have been filled with the Holy Spirit as we have. So those are good step. We have been saved. That one good step. We have been filled with the Holy Spirit. That one that a good step says but now we want the mind that was in Christ to be in us. The same mind that was in Christ, we need to have it in us to think like him, to love like him, to forgive like him, to be humble LIKE HIM, TO REACT LIKE HIM. OH, THAT TAKES MORE THAN JUST BEING SAVED. That takes more than just be religious. THAT TAKES EVEN MORE THAN JUST TO BE, OKAY, I I I have an experience of the Holy Ghost. It takes more than that. You need to grow to come to the point where I have the mind OF JESUS CHRIST. WHAT will Jesus Christ do in these situations? What would Jesus Christ think in THESE SITUATIONS? THAT'S WHERE I WANT TO GET TO. LORD, even know my prayer. Lord, how would Jesus Christ pray in these situations? That's how I want to get Lord. I don't want to be just a a a a a a I would say a limited Christian. I want to grow. I want I want to increase. I want to come to the fullness of who he is. Because we ARE LIVING IN THE TIME OF THE fullness of the full seed. The same seed that was in the ground. That same seed has to come to the full maturity. THE FULL MATURITY TAKES THE MIND AS WE HAVE TO CHANGE OUR MIND. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; So that we might be transformed the the natural things of life and be brought into do the perfect will of God by transformation of God's spirit by his word. Now he says now my subject is the is the power of transformation. And he's going that he says oh I' I've I've I've gone through many battles in my life. Oh I've gone through many time. I'm old and I've been through many hard battles. See, but going through those hard battles brings you where you are this morning. Says, I'm sure you understand that God has put me through it through it that my life might open up a way to say this is it. See that you all run over that road before me there was someone open up the way for me to go through. Maybe you don't understand what you are going through. Maybe see that I'm going through this trials. I'm going through this battle. But the God give me your mind. Give me give me your thinking. Let me think the way you think. Let me see even this trial the way you will see a little maybe you are just opening up. Bring me to a certain maturity you want me to have. Lord help me to analyze it in a way not as human will a human being will but the way Christ will see it. Amen. Then he said transforming. We are used to work in a public service company where we are transformers and to transform. Now the word the word means in itself something to transform means something that been changed something that is changed from one thing to another. As I want to speak the next just they say to be transformed is to be changed and made something different. That what that was my that that what caught my attention again here is a tadpole. It's transformed from a tadpole to a frog. See, once he looked like a catfish, he swims around. He's got a head and his tail and everything looks like he's a catfish. Then after a while, he begins to lose. He loses the tail. Is transformed from one species to another. Oh yes, I'm It's still the same thing. It's still the same person or if you can call it the person, but still the same animal, but it's changing stages. is changing stages as is growing is losing certain things as our Christian walk and then you you you have a Christian. Oh, I am I'm I'm a Christian. I'm walking with God. Yes. But maybe you are still at the stage of a tadpole. [laughter] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You will get there one day. But but God in the stage of tadpole, yeah, you do your best and everything. But what is the secret? Just stay in the channel. Amen. and feed upon the word of God. &gt;&gt; The more you are feeding, the more the transformation is happening is happening from the inside. The more you ARE STAYING IN THAT CHANNEL, the more you are feeding upon the word of God and the tadpole one day, oh, you lose your tail. Oh, the tail is gone. I USED TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF MALICE, A LITTLE BIT OF A HANGER, a little bit, BUT IT'S GONE. HOW COME IT'S GONE? WHO REMOVED IT? NOT SOMEONE WHO CAME AND FORMED you to remove it or or trying to make you conform to it. NO, IT TRANSFORMED FROM THE INSIDE FROM WHAT YOU ARE EATING and from the STAYING IN THE CHANNEL OF GOD TO STAYING IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD. AMEN. THEN THE TRANSFORMATION IS happening from the inside and ONE DAY YOU BECOME A FROG. [laughter] That's a bad example. But [laughter] then one DAY IT'S A FROG AND THEN OH YEAH. OH YEAH. BUT IT'S still the same thing that change, right? Okay, let's take a better example. You are a worm. You are a worm, but one DAY YOU'LL BE A BUTTERFLY, RIGHT? THAT'S A BIT better example. [laughter] A worm and you're just there and you're just earthly and then nothing is happening and you're still crawling and things things happening, things bothering you and things like that. BUT AS YOU FEED MORE AND WE HAVE RECEIVED the spiritual food in due season. It's the it's the food is the eagle food. The more you eat it, the more you eat it, the more you eat it, the more it's changing your inside. It's changing your inside that you can't explain. You can't you can't you you can't scientifically PROVE IT. BUT IT'S CHANGING YOU. AND THEN ONE DAY YOU START FLYING [clears throat] ABOVE THE CIRCUMSTANCES, above the situations. The same trial that used to bother you a few years ago, the same trials comes, but you are FLYING ABOVE THE TRIAL. SAYS, "OH, PRAISE BE TO GOD. LORD, I KNOW YOU ARE IN CONTROL OF EVERY SITUATION. I KNOW YOU WILL GIVE ME DELIVERANCE BECAUSE IF YOU DELIVERED ME THERE, YOU CAN DELIVER ME TODAY. YOU made me go through certain trials, BUT I KNOW YOU WILL GIVE ME THE VICTORY. YOU ARE MY HEALER. YOU ARE MY SAVIOR. YOU ARE MY PROVIDER. YOU ARE MY HOLY LORD. YOU ARE MY REDEEMER. YOU ARE CHANGING ME. YOU HAVE GIVEN ME THE PROMISE FOR THE RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; ALL THE THING WORKS TOGETHER FOR THOSE WHO LOVE YOU. Lord &gt;&gt; transformation. Lord change my mind. Father change my mind. See once he looked in I see I read that says being transformed by the renew. Let's see. Let me get that right. Be not confirmed. You know what's confirmed is renewing of your mind. The things that you once thought upon to be precious. You lay that aside and be transformed to something else that was one times to what you are now by the renewing of your mind that you might prove that good, acceptable, perfect will of God. That's what we want to know how to do it. Says here we love here we are here. We love him. He saved us. Now we want to know what to do. We are trying to take a little step this morning to raise up a little bit higher. Sometimes we have to hit these things and hold on and we see that it comes out. Then you take an example say look at in Genesis what happened in Genesis was complete darkness, complete chaos and how how it used to be complete chaos. And God says let the light be just the word of God. And that word of God came and it changed from that chaos from that darkness that came something real. They came the earth came the all the the all the planets came something real. Then we used to be in sin. We used to be in different things completely darkness and all this. Then we heard the light the word of God. LET THE LIGHT BE IN OUR SOUL. AND THEN WE GRASP at the word of God. We believed it and we HAVE BEEN CHANGED. SOMETHING has happened in our life. Amen. BUT IT'S NOT THE END OF IT. GOD CONTINUED THE CREATION AND AT ONE TIME AND THEN he [clears throat] had to create and he create a garden of Eden said it transform into a garden of Eden. And that's how we are transformed by the God's words. When God said let there be light and that mass of creation out there comes over and around the sun and begin to revolve around the sun and became a garden of Eden because it obeyed the word of God. The the the world had to obey the word of God. That's what became THE GARDEN OF EDEN. THE SAME PROCESS THAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH. IF WE COME TO BECOME THE GARDEN OF EDEN IN OUR SOUL, WE HAVE TO OBEY THE WORD OF GOD. Believe the word of God. AMEN. THAT'S WHERE RESIDE IN THE POWER of transformation. Then he says, you know, sometimes we are in a hurry, but God is not in a hurry. Sometimes we are in a hurry, but God is not in a hurry. We just need to have faith in him and trust in him. Amen. Then we get to the level I'm trying to save time. Then we get to the level it says then we come to the level where he said let seed each seed produce of it same of it same kind. Then you see the seed that will produce of the same kind. If you have an orange orange seed it will produce an orange and in that seed there is everything that needs to produce an orange tree. in that seed. So it has all the potential to produce the orange tree and then the seed that the orange that will come later on in that small seed. That's the same thing we as God has put in our heart in our soul. The seed of God inside our soul. Amen. What we need that seed to be quickened by the word of God. It to be quickened by the son of God. Amen. Once it has been quickened THEN NEEDS TO GROW. BUT IT CONTAINS inside of it all the potentials. We shall need to let we shall let that potential to be manifested. Amen. We have to let it TO BE MANIFESTED. THEN THE KEY to it is all the power transformation of that seed to be changed from that seed and to become a plant and then to produce fruit. All the power is contained in that seed. Everything is contained in that. is not taking something from the outside to make that seed to be changed from a se from a lemon to become a orange. No, if it is an orange, it will STAY A ORANGE. IT HAS THE POTENTIAL OF AN ORANGE INSIDE THAT SEED. AMEN. We have the potential to become the full mature CHRISTIANS IN OUR AGE. AMEN. [gasps] BUT WHAT WE need is to receive the word that will bring us to that maturity and is to receive the the THE SUN THE SUN SU N THAT WILL BRING US TO THAT MATURITY. AMEN. THE SON OF THE MORNING IS still the same son. Amen. IT'S STILL THE SAME BIBLE. BUT NOW WE HAVE THE revelation of the word of God upon the Bible to bring us THE LIGHT, THE LIFE OF IT SO THAT WE CAN MANIFEST WHAT IS INSIDE OF US. NOW IT IS THE HARVEST SON OF GOD. AMEN. THE LIGHT THAT SHINE UPON US HAS TO PRODUCE THE LIFE of the maturity. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD CHANGED ME TO PRODUCE THE LIFE OF THE MATURITY. NOT A BABY LIFE BUT A LIFE OF MATURITY. LORD, LIFE OF PRAYER, LIFE of trust, life of confidence in you. LORD, I WANT TO GET THERE. FATHER, is that YOUR DESIRE IN MY HEART? IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS BURNING INSIDE OF ME. LORD, I WANT TO GET THERE. I WANT TO MANIFEST CHRIST, THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST, the humility of Christ says, hopefully I can finish with this one. Says everything under control to bring forth of its kind. Now remember to bring when he puts the seed on the earth the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it to transform it from a seed to a plant or whatever it was his transforming power. Now God put the seed in there with potentials that it will be what he said it will be. And as long as it stayed in right category, it will be just exactly what say what God said it will be. It had to be that way because he had made it that way. made a channel that anything that stays in his channel, in his line of word, it will have to produce forth exactly like his word said it will do. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, your word says that that there will be a a a a mature bride in this last age. Yes. If I stay in that channel, if I stay in that category, I stay in line with the word of God, it will produce what the word of God says. I believe it with all my heart. It cannot move from there. It's channeled right just exactly right. So with everything in the trust in his own s then it will be that way. Then God said it's all good. So it will just rest. And each one of those seeds has power in itself to transform itself into the specy that I desire it to be. That what m that what it must be because I have given every seed transforming power. It's not something from the outside nor it within the seed.
