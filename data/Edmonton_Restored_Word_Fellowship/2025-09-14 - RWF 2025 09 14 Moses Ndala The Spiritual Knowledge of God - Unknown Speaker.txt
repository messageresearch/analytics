I was just listening to one tape and then not a tape but recording an old recording of a brother and that and he was the song leader was was singing that song that the sister sang there and just made a comment. Can you just realize that he sought you and he bought you &gt;&gt; he sought you didn't seek for him. You look not looking for him but he was seeking for you looking for you and he found you and he bought you to himself. You belong to him before but he still bought you again just to say okay this is mine again. &gt;&gt; Wonderful comment that he made and that stuck with me for the week and just today again God has reminded me that he's the one in the business of salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you richly and bless your sister and thank you for for the Matendos sisters. They're not mandos anymore. We still call them matendos, but I was communicating with with my dear sister Aman. And I look at the last name. I was like, okay, I need to memorize this new last name. I just liked it. And God bless you. We appreciate you. Appreciate the gift and your life. You have been serving the Lord. God bless you richly. We appreciate you richly. Thank you for the special that you sang there. It's a city where we are going. Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh there won't be any cry. There won't be any sorrow in that city. We are looking for it. That's why we are here for that. He's desiring to have fellowship with us and we desire to have fellowship with him. Amen. Thank you. First second Peter's one on five as we go to our studies. Thank you musicians. God bless you all. Second Peter chapter 1 5 be reading these scriptures for couple of days again ahead in front of us. I just want to to put your to bring your attention something here. Simon Peter, the Bible says, Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that they have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God. Can you say with me, through the righteousness of God? Amen. through the righteousness of God and our savior Jesus Christ. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you once again through the righteousness of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God and of Jesus our Lord and according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him. Let's say together, through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue. Thank you. Whereby I given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. and beside this giving all diligence at your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge. Amen. May God bless his word and we can have a seat. Amen. I would like to speak this morning about the spiritual knowledge of God as a as a third attribute on our on our construction our building block to get to the statue of a perfect man. So the third attribute there of the knowledge and knowledge the spiritual knowledge of God. I would like to read again in 2 Corinthians 10:36. For though we know, for though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but they are mighty through God through the pulling down of strongholds, casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exaltth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ, and having a readiness, a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled. So the war that we have is war against imaginations against thought against against what you are thinking or your unbelief anything that is exalting itself against that knowledge of God. So that's where the war is actually. So it's a very important part. Sometimes we might neglect it or sometimes we look over it and we think okay that's just that's a good name or something like that. But actually very important in our warfare against the enemy. It's a knowledge of the of knowledge of God and we know that the knowledge of God is knowledge of Christ and Christ is the word. Amen. So that's what we like just to look for a moment here just to to to challenge oursel a little bit and also just for the word of God to prickle our heart and also to recognize what God has done in our life by opening the word of God that today we have the full interpretation. We have the perfect interpretation of the word of God with perfect vindication. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. for those who have a book and follow that. I will I think my my comment will be from from paragraph 160 to paragraph to paragraph 218. So that portion there. So that's where most of the thought comes and the comment of the prophet. So the prophet says in the statue of the perfect man, he says that's supreme knowledge. That's supreme knowledge. You don't have to h you don't have to have four degrees in some college or something like that to have it because all these virtues are given to you by God &gt;&gt; to place upon the foundation of your faith that you might come to the full stature of a real living man of God. &gt;&gt; As we talk about knowledge, it might look like it's something that ourself we have to acquire. without something that ourel we can pile it on it let me let me try to know him let me try to let let me try to know him let me to have more knowledge it sounds like that and and I would say I I have to be sincere with me there is a part of it and yeah there's a part of it but it's not everything about that only there is a part where God has to extend or to give us that virtue of knowledge of himself amen that's why it's important so just having a carnal knowledge is not is not enough or is not sufficient. Amen. We need a portion where God himself has to intervene because these virtues all of them have to be given by God. Amen. We don't pluck them upon ourself and say okay this is my doing this is my myself. Yeah, there is a portion of where we have ourself to make diligence as the Bible gives us um gives us recommend us or earn us to to do. But it's not everything. There is a part where God himself has to do the supernatural work. Amen. But the foundation of all this has to be revelation. The foundation of all this has to be faith. I repeat it again. The foundation of all this has to be faith because that's what the prophet says. When you say I'll take God now you don't say that just to say well I take it or just from your heart but it's something in you it actually your faith that is pushes him out your faith pushed out there there you are your faith says I know he's the same amen is witness in him the same there's nothing can take it away from me I know is real prophet says amen then add that your faith let it down let sit down on the foundation. Come up now. Come up right on towards the kingdom of God. Got to a spot now. So there is a faith as as you are growing up. It's your revelation. It's like a seed. Like a plant that many times but that illustration stays with us. It's like a plant, a little plant, the seed. Inside of that seed, there is everything. Inside of the new birth that you had as a foundation, there is everything. But it has to grow. It's from that same seed, from the same life that was in that seed. It has to go. It's pushing out. It's pushing out. It will push out faith. It will push out virtue, knowledge, and all the other virtues until it come to the to the stature of of the fullness of Christ himself. So always keep that in mind. It has to be God doing the supernatural work. Amen. Because if you just go then just going to to school and learn things or I'll say or if you just rely on that you're going to fall around somewhere. So it has to be God doing the supernatural work. And says the thirdly you add knowledge knowledge. Now that don't mean wordly knowledge because that fullness foolishness to God. Worldly knowledge is foolishness to God. But knowledge to judge say judge what? Right from wrong. How to judge it. Then you've got Christian knowledge with your virtue and faith. You judge whether the world is right or wrong. If you can lay aside all your creeds and all your unbelief and everything that you claim you have, then you have knowledge to believe God cannot lie. Let every man's word be a lie, but mine be true. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a wonderful paragraph there. So we can just try to try to to unveil a bit more of it. So that doesn't mean worldly knowledge because it is foolishness to God. So why usually the prophet repeats that many and the Bible repeats that many times. Why why why is emphasizing so much on the fact that the worldly knowledge is a foolishness to God. We cannot rely on worldly knowledge. actually worldly knowledge if you're not very careful it might lead you away from God &gt;&gt; then bring you closer to God. In 1 Corinthians 3:18 the Bible says let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemth to be wise in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise. &gt;&gt; That's quite the paradox. That's quite that something goes around. Let him become a fool so that might be wise. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. &gt;&gt; For it is written, he taketh the wise in their in in their own craft craft craftiness. And again the Lord knoweth the thought of the wise that they are vain. I'm not against education. Prophet is not against education. God is not against education. If I have just to put a little bit as a comment here, just put a paragraph here. Don't put that on emphasis on that. I like education. I love education. I encourage my children to do education myself. I have a I'll say education. Let's put that way. I have education. Education. I have four degrees at university. They made me study and I and I love study. I love studying. It's like it's like my hobby when I'm there. I can I can spend weeks and weeks just reading and everything that that I and close from the world I can do that that that so I'm a little bit scholar scholar how do you scholarly person right just like to study that's how I made I made uh so I like education everything is but I just want to put here a little emphasis to know that education has actually is is something if you're not very careful as I said earlier Here it's something if you are not very careful it makes you to reason. It makes you to think. It makes you to analyze things. It makes you things has to be logical before you accept it. &gt;&gt; But God is not something that you can take by logical by logic and okay this is this this and okay then it has to be this and that it and I figure it out. I figure out God how he works and that's it and then I put him in the box. You can't put God in a box. God is unlimited. God is great. God is is infinite. So science can never comprehend God. Education can never comprehend God. Can never understand God. So the more educated you become, let me tell you, the more prudent you should be to realize, oh God, now I'm becoming more and more um prone to be deceived &gt;&gt; because the devil likes to work on reasoning. But how we came to Eve? He came by reasoning. Came by think you know it doesn't make sense that this this can do this. Amen. So you have to come and the more educated you are becoming and especially in Leodia in the time we are living you can listen to the radio. You can listen to the Christian to the Christian radio and things. Most of the preachers have to be PhD doctor in this doctor in this doctor in this doctor in this right because they put that credit on them like we have to study God and make that yes there's a certain value but if you put emphasis like on that then you are putting God aside &gt;&gt; God is simple God is so simple if you try to make God so complicated to people then people lose it &gt;&gt; and Paul was Paul was like Paul was very educative, very scholarly God. But he had to remove everything that he had of the scholar and everything that the degree that he had to realize that he was nothing. Then God was ready to use him. &gt;&gt; The same thing for Moses. He was very well educated and he knew everything about science and everything. He had 40 years of training in Egyptian. God had to take 40 years to remove all that so that God can start using him. Amen. So when we realize that as a Christian especially in this Laia I'm talking maybe just a small portion of people in that in that area every time you go in big studies you have to realize oh I need to depend on God more &gt;&gt; because when I go higher I become start thinking that I know you don't know anything &gt;&gt; actually when you know more you actually becoming more an in you might become Can you prone to be an instrument of the dava? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same thing for beauty. The David works in beauty. Oh. Oh. When everybody looks at, oh, wow, what a beautiful girl. Oh, what a handsome boy. As a Christian, it's a danger. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's not wrong by itself. Actually, it's a blessing for whoever you're married to. Like my wife is blessed by marrying me. I'm just saying that as a to relax you a little bit but it's actually a problem because you become a target. &gt;&gt; The devil can use you to put many people in hell than any other thing. &gt;&gt; So when you recognize that then you say okay let me protect it's my weakness. Let me try to protect myself. If it's a girl let me dress up properly. Let me let me be decent because I'm be I'm I'm becoming more of a target that the enemy can use &gt;&gt; to to bring his children down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same thing for we we we know as a message believer, as a Christian, we know how the devil works now, right? &gt;&gt; The same thing for for for popularity. But I'm saying use his popularity. When you're just simple Christians, oh, everything is fine. But when you become start became popular, oh that's a very wonderful preacher. Have you heard about this? This is the only one for convention. These are &gt;&gt; as yourself when you hear that. So God help me to humble myself because I'm becoming more and more as a target. Can be a song leader. It can be whoever it can be the one who prays. Every time that you start getting higher, remember you are becoming a target for the enemy. So you need to oh Lord, I'm this is my weakness. Let me protect it. Let me be humble. Let me dedicate myself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same thing for money. Oh, when you're just a simple citizen and everything, everything is okay. But once you have a promotion, anything like this, anything, then you start going to Lamborghini. Let me take that example. &gt;&gt; Lamborghini. &gt;&gt; Lamborghini or L. Oh, wherever it's going. Oh. CRV CRV CRV so far. Oh, I wish I was rich. Then remember target. &gt;&gt; So God, help me to be humble. &gt;&gt; Help me to be humble. So going back to to to knowledge here because it there is there's a very connection between knowledge in the world and knowledge and we might might be a little bit confusion let's put it this way between knowledge in the world and knowledge of God himself. The knowledge of the world actually studied and civilization studied with the line of Cain not with the line of Abel. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says in Genesis 4:17, "Kain knew his wife and she conceived and bare Enoch and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch." So Kane was the one who built the first recorded city. It's actually the beginning of of civilization. &gt;&gt; So civilization is not necessarily something you say, "Oh, now these are more civilized people. Oh, we are, you know, the more civilized you become, the more worldliness come into it. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; There's always been like that. &gt;&gt; Always been like that. The more civilized you become, the more worldliness will will will come into that city. You see, it's very easy to convert an educated even &gt;&gt; someone without know anything. &gt;&gt; But it's very hard to to convince even an elect. Very hard. You have to work a little bit harder because he has been educated and different things. Let's try to analyze that the prophet himself saying it's very hard to to be convinced a educated heathen because it's very hard. Why civilization is always against God. You see in many village maybe in Africa where where many people have gone evangel evangelized you go there in a town where there's no television. Oh people are decent people. But the moment where television goes there or internet goes there, civilization goes there, worldliness follows. &gt;&gt; Amen. Civilization because it has been from the beginning the work of the line of Cain. And Cain is a of the serpent seed. &gt;&gt; He's from the line of Satan. Amen. He didn't he was not a son of God. Was the son of the serpent. Amen. Genesis 4:20 says, "And Jebel, this is the genealogy of of Cain. If you go the genealogy of of Abel of Jesus going there, you'll go it go back all all the way to to to Adam, the son of God. But but you go if you go from from Cain doesn't go to that he was the son of Adam. So he was the son of someone else. And Adam B Jabel and he was the father of such as dwelt in the tent of such as have cattle and his brother's name was Jabel and he was the father of all such a handle the hop and organ and zil she also bear tubal and an instructor of every artificer and brass and iron and the sister of tubalen was nama. So there was the father of herders, the animals, the father of music, the musical instrument and the first known methologist of the one who was working with brass and iron all were from the line of gain. But if you look from the line of Abel, just simple people, just a simple simple population, just simple herder and shepherd &gt;&gt; and and that's how God wanted it to be. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me ding? &gt;&gt; Why? Because God hides and reveals himself in simplicity. &gt;&gt; Even Jesus Christ himself thanked the father for revealing the spiritual truth only to the babes. Amen. In Matthew 11:25 says, "At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, oh father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou has hed these things from the wise and prudent, and you have revealed them unto babes." And the prophet will say unto babes such as are willing to learn. Amen. Babes are willing to learn. Amen. So we have to be willing to learn. We are living in a year where people know everything. They know it. They're not it all. You want to tell them something. Oh, I know it. If you know even we talking fellowship with the with the with the brother yesterday. Brother Elisha came to our place and we fellowship. We know how our children educate them from the very young age. I know. You ask him, can you this? I know. Even though they don't know, but it's the first thing. I know. Can you I know. Why? I know. Because it's knowledge. Knowledge. Knowledge. &gt;&gt; But you don't know. You have to be willing to learn. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that spirit gets into sometimes into the church too. &gt;&gt; So no, I I know. Oh, I know. I have access all to the tapes. I don't need to come to church. Why minister? I know. &gt;&gt; That's true. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Yeah. And sometimes they know more than the preacher. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Sometimes and then they correct you and you know but I'm saying oh yeah you know. Yeah for sure. But can we have that spirit Lord I desire to learn more. I desire to be humble. I desire father Lord to follow your order. I desire to be obedient. Touch my heart. Make me like that sheep is the first song we help me if if possible to lose some of my rights, human rights. Amen. So that to be under the order of God. &gt;&gt; Oh, keep us that heart that is humble and simple. That what we desire to be should never lose that become the simplicity of the go. The gospel is simple. Amen. The life of it. The gospel is just a life. Amen. It's not even a carnal knowledge. It's just a life. Amen. That's what we desire. &gt;&gt; Paul said in Philippians 3, he says, "But what things were gained to me those I counted loss for Christ. Yeah, doubtless and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered a loss of all things and to count them but done that I may win Christ. He was very educated but he saw this is that I can't win Christ with all this I put that aside and let me humble myself and learn from Christ himself. He go he goes further in 1 Corinthians 1 just a teaching this morning. Amen. 1 Corinthians 1:17:31 says, "For Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel, not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect. &gt;&gt; If the preaching of Christ was based on how eloquent you are and how educated you are, you will make the cross of Christ of non effect. It will be depending on people's ability. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the himself Paul says, "But for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but unto us which are saved, it is the power of God." Amen. In that simplicity, it's still the power of God. &gt;&gt; It has the power to change. It has the power to transform. It has the power to heal. Is the power to give a sane mind in that simplicity of the gospel. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. For it is return, it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Have not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? For after that in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God? It pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. the foolishness of preaching. I was listening to the prophet. He says, you know, why people are making why the business the business you know he was how do you call the business go you know the business people he was talking to &gt;&gt; business &gt;&gt; businessman go through the gospel business. So they took over over the preacher said no we will take over because we are more rich more educated those simple preachers here they have no education everything so we take over them. The prophet says, "No, that's not the order. You have not been called. Don't try to make don't try to correct God. That's the order of God. Calling a preacher is a call from inside whether he's educated or not educated, whether he makes his sentence correct or not." Amen. But as long as standing upon the word of God, you stand behind him. &gt;&gt; Because what is saving what Paul is that what Paul is saying it please God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. &gt;&gt; Think about John the Baptist. I usually make my wife like that. John the Baptist he was not taking a shower. He was not you know he was not dressed properly. You come to his congregation even my brother gosh could smell he's here but he could smell so you in the congregation but that was the gospel for the time without him the way could not be prepared for the Messiah God uses simple things very simple things to show his power because he want to take on the glory the glory should not be upon a man it has to go back to God himself &gt;&gt; that the order has made and no one should change him. He's the infinite God, but he chose you to do it. So, amen. &gt;&gt; So don't think whenever you think I'm a very educated, why should I go and sit on an uneducated person? &gt;&gt; Bad road you already going. That's the Satan road. Amen. &gt;&gt; Actually, the more I'm educated, I should sit more &gt;&gt; because I'm being a people from the world are bombarding me with different things. Now God needs also to fill him me with it's it's a law. There is only one container right everybody want to fill in that same container. The world want to fill something inside of you. You also need to feed yourself with the word of God so that you remove all the other things. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm on a knowledge. So are you with me? &gt;&gt; Just part of me. It's not target to anybody. There no one. If there is one, it's I'm the first first. I have four degrees. Useless degrees. They help me for the job. I have a good job by God's grace. But some people did just a certificate and I'm working with them &gt;&gt; and they are earning the same money I'm earning. But I spent 12 years, 14 years university. Too much knowledge. But then when I look at the word of God, that's still the absolute no matter what. &gt;&gt; For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seeks after wisdom. For we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling block. Why aren't the Jews a stumbling block? Because they were expecting a great Messiah. The great messiah will come the chariot is the king is like David is the everybody should respect but now Paul is preaching to them Christ not even Christ healing or Christ when when is like Christ in the power Christ crucified &gt;&gt; that that's my king &gt;&gt; crucified naked that's why you are preaching to me as a Jew no no no no stumbling block no we don't want that we want a famous king like like soul all then we know our &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; stumbling block. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And to the Greek foolishness because the Greek at that time they like to reason. Oh how does it make sense here? Let's go. If you say this sentence after that you know we learn philosophy you say this and then you can't contradict what you say before and but how can you teach to me something about Jesus Christ? Oh the Bible says you know don't speak to the foolish and the next verse speak to the foolish. How can you explain to me that I I can't explain to you. I just say &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometime you can't explain. We just believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But unto them which are called both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. Because the foolishness of God is wiser than man, and the weakness of God is stronger than man. For you see your calling, brethren, now that not many wise men, not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called, but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise. And God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty. &gt;&gt; I thank God for the weak things. &gt;&gt; I thank God. God, we are we are those despised one. those weak things that God has chosen to confound the world. How come you are not bound to the pressure of Leicia? Oh, God chose the weak things just to show how great he is. I am nothing but God chose me. He sought me. He the one who bought me. He's the one who has chosen me. I didn't choose him. He chose me by his grace. I'm nothing but he chose me. Amen. He selected me by his grace. God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and best things of the world and things which are despised. Has God chosen yes things which are not to bring to not things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence because he wants all the glory to him and we want all the glory to go to him. But of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God is made up is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption. And according as it is written, he that glorify the Lord. Amen. And that's what we desire. God delights in using the humble, the simple, the overlooked to accomplish his purpose, to show his power. He took David. David was nothing. Those was just a a a a shepherd and back there even his father think about even his father neglecting him. &gt;&gt; But he said he called all the giant all the one the mighty one all the soldiers Samuel you are going to anoint them. Even the prophet himself look oh I saw this one. Oh no this has to be the king. He want to go and anoint him. God says on oh stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop no stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop you are just look from the what the outside I don't look at the outside I don't look how beautiful how great it is from the outside I look the inside &gt;&gt; I look for the seed I leave for that place that's where I'm looking at &gt;&gt; and one after the other one after all the seven say that's all you have as a as children say so oh I have one I have one Then they call the little David there completely neglect by his own father &gt;&gt; is the one that God chose. He's the man after my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because a simple man, just a simple man. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; He took, as I mentioned, he took John the Baptist to confound the kings. Just a simple man. From the outside I don't let me tell you from the outside if John the Baptist was in Laia even us will be struggling. I'm telling you we will be struggling with John the Baptist the way he is. Thank God brother Banam didn't go in the wood &gt;&gt; because even his wife would have left him. &gt;&gt; God said no no no you are higher order. Maybe God were thinking of us. You know, no, no, you have to stay, put a dress, put a tie, people see you because if you go like John the Baptist or Elisha, no, they'll be struggling. &gt;&gt; That's true. It took William Branham, a a man just of seventh grade, to confound the mighty with a ministry to call out the bride from all denominations. I will say, "Praise be to God." Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 8:12 the Bible says, "Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we have we we we all have knowledge. Knowledge puff puff puffs up, but charity edifileth. If any man think that he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know." Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe this is a powerful reminder of humility especially in matters of knowledge especially spiritual understanding. It teaches us that our knowledge is still limited compared to God's wisdom and we must remain teachable and humble. &gt;&gt; Never lose that teachable attitude. &gt;&gt; I come to learn. Amen. Sometime you feel like you don't learn anything. say something you don't you feel like you don't learn anything but there will come a situation where what you just heard you think you know it was just in your mind oh I need that I need that quick word I need that because God God is infinite you can't limit God amen &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 11:3 but I fear less by any means as the serpent begal Eve through his subtility that your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ and this is a danger then we think that the because the opening of the word is the word is open then things has to be complicated and say oh wow that's was really wonderful what did you what did you learn uh you need to ask the preacher it was just wonderful it was so good no things have to be simple &gt;&gt; simple because the sheep are simple &gt;&gt; Amen Man, I like the ministry in our church. Our our brother uh uh brother Victor and brother Gilbert take things they make it so simple. Oh, you found in him. Who's him? Oh, that thing. Yeah, I always remember brother G. But that thing, what's that thing? Taking out the scriptures. Oh, I never saw that. Oh, that's so simple. Oh, just so simple. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank God for that. I don't want to lose you but let's be like children when it comes to faith otherwise the more we understand things the more we are prone to reason but let be at simple Paul want the believers not to be led away from the simple pure uncomplicated truth of the gospel not relying on human wisdom or additions or distortion but it has to be simple faith is simple Abraham It was told to him, Abraham, you shall have a son. You shall have a son. Abram could not explain it. Could not understand it physically or scientifically. Could not explain to a doctor how it's going to be. Abraham only had to believe what God said. Amen. And the same for us. We just have to believe. No matter the circumstances, no matter the situation, no matter the symptoms, no matter even our own life, our weaknesses, we just need to believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's faith. Believers believes. Amen. We just need to believe. Prophet continues the statue of the perfect man. He says, "Knowledge not wordly. It reasons." The kind of worldly knowledge reasons, but faith has no reasoning. God reveals to you a certain thing and a certain thing is going to happen. Every scientist in the world could tell you it's contrary. It could not happen. You still believe it anyhow. Yes, sir. It doesn't reason. The Bible said we cast down reasons. Now the scripture read cast down all reasons. You don't reason with faith. Faith has no reasoning. Faith knows where it's at. Faith acts. Faith holds on. It can't move. Nothing can move it. I don't care. Whatever says this, that or the other. It doesn't move a bit. It stays right there. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't make any different. Faith stays right there. Amen. &gt;&gt; I thank God. We need to have more faith. Amen. God give us more revelation and revelation with simplicity of heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let every let God be true and every man be a liar for God cannot lie according to the word of God can God can never lie. &gt;&gt; It sounds simple but it is it very hard in life because many times when things get hard we go against the word of God. In other words, it's like we are implying to God, no God, what you are saying is not true. It's what I'm thinking to do is is true. That's quite a big statement. And by the way, we live sometimes. Amen. Because it has to be this way. It has this is the order of God. No, I think my way is the the best way. No. Then you are implying that God is wrong. But God can never lie. Amen. He can never lie to keep his word as well when it comes to promises. Amen. He can never lie. Amen. It might take time but God will fulfill his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Time is feeling upon me. The supreme knowledge is the knowledge that discerns right from wrong. from this one I think is one of the most important quality of the believer is to have spiritual discernment to to understand or the believer has to be able to judge what the right from wrong according to God's words not according to traditions or opinions but he has to be able to have a discernment one of the thing we should ask more God give me discernment &gt;&gt; because discernment is very important for the believer &gt;&gt; to know when it's the right time to know when it's the right thing to do. Amen. Sometimes to make the right decision it we need discernment. Amen. The prophet continues the statue of a perfect man still on the on the knowledge says to judge right to judge right. Judge whether it's right or wrong to believe God's word. Judge whether it's right or wrong. Whether I should serve a creed or serve God. Judge whether it's right or wrong I should be born again or join a church. Then you are beginning. Judge right. When the preacher says the days of miracle is passed, but the Bible says Jesus is Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Now, which one are you going to believe? &gt;&gt; I'm going to believe the Bible. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to believe the word of God. &gt;&gt; A mature believer discerns not just by appearance, but he judges and discerns by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Spiritual knowledge teaches us to recognize what aligns with God's will. Amen. As in Hebrews 5:14 says, "But strong meat belongth to them that are full of age," means mature people. Amen. "And even those who by reason of use have their senses exercise to discern both good and evil." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have revelation. You have a faith. You believe in God. But as you are becoming mature, you have to be able to exercise that super sense to be able to discern both good and evil. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you have to be able to discern the spirit behind things. &gt;&gt; Someone can do something very good but you have to discern the spirit behind it. &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet can you imagine the prophet in the congre I I won't have that courage but the prophet in the congregation someone want to speak in tongue and first meeting prophet let it go second meeting let it go after that no no no no it's only when I'm about to call the the altar then the person start speaking tong &gt;&gt; it's a good thing it's a discernment it's a unveiling of the will of God I guess but says no now I discern that the wrong spirit good thing but wrong spirit &gt;&gt; then you rebuked it &gt;&gt; that takes discernment &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; and we can have someone who's doing something I would say wrong maybe making mistakes but he has a good spirit &gt;&gt; he does know better &gt;&gt; he's just trying &gt;&gt; and then if you are mature you should encourage him &gt;&gt; even though he's making mistake you still encourage him &gt;&gt; as we do to our children sometimes make mistake but you still encourage because you you you know the intention behind it. It's not that the simple error a simple mistake this is serve the Lord you'll go to hell. No you you see the spirit behind it and you encourage it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at that scripture. Beautiful scripture. Psalm 911. For he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways. That's a wonderful scripture. They shall bear the angels shall bear thee up in their hands lest I dash thy foot against a stone. Oh, if every morning someone could read to me that scripture said, "Oh, that wonderful scripture. The devil used it against Jesus Christ." Amen. &gt;&gt; Says, "If thy be the son of God, cast thyself down. For it is written, it shall be, he shall give the angel charge concerning thee, and their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time that should dash thy foot against the stone." Matthew 4:6. He's quoting exactly the scripture. But Jesus Christ having the knowledge of God, the right discernment says, "Oh yeah, it is also written. It is also written, thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. &gt;&gt; That's a mature Christian &gt;&gt; to know if sometimes when something is being quoted, but if it's not caught it with the right spirit, &gt;&gt; you discern the spirit behind it says no. Oh, hold on. It is also written. I'll say there are many things in the word of God. It is about written. It is also written. &gt;&gt; Is written is also written. Written is also written. written is also many things many situations many situation in brother Bham they ask him a question he answer to this one the next time he comes answer question he answer a little bit different from that &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; now as a mature Christian yourself not even others yourself lord what is the spirit leading me &gt;&gt; because sometimes you can cling just one script one but because you want to justify your own life oh no it is also written. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The knowledge of God is to have the balance in everything. &gt;&gt; God give us balance in every situation. Every give us the the right motive, the right objective and the right balance, the right spirit, the right attitude. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then we'll always end up right. &gt;&gt; Prophet says early spiritual experiences. Another message it says Isaiah said there will be a highway and a way is a conjunction a way it won't be called the highway of holiness. How many remember brother Gideon's message on the balance he used this one of these quotes says right in the middle of the road on the side of there is some people when they get born again they set right in the middle of the road eyes on Christ that's where we should be finally they get over here if you go on the other side so much knowledge and wisdom till they know it all prophet says you don't know nothing if you don't do that you run off the other side to a bunch of wildfire and fanatism. So one side here it has to be does that it has to be only if you want if you are preaching to me you have to read only brother or brother only the tape play because that word has to be extractly if you are preaching read me only what the prophet says okay yeah that's extremely and the other one here doesn't check whether it's a prophet whether someone just take from Luther and everything they're preaching to them and they're just happy and everything. No, take in the middle. You know the prophet the prophet Paul was being corrected by people were checking in the new test in the Old Testament what Paul is preaching. So preaching the Christian at beria they're preaching what what Paul is but they're comparing to what the Bible says. What did the Bible says what the Old Testament says? But if you read all the letters of Paul was it completely repeating word by word what the what the Old Testament says? No, it was a revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the preaching it's not one sent each sentence has come but it's a revelation clarification making things simple. Breaking the bread for the people as Jesus Christ give the bread to the disciples. The disciples break it down to the level where people can take it. Amen. A prophet is still a prophet. He has a language that is prophetic. We can say one sentence but people have to break it down so that we understand better. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. But right in the middle of the way goes a true sound and adulterated gospel and power of God. That's right. Right down through there there where you can take it to kings and monarchs where anybody can stand and search and they can see that it's the power of the almighty God. Not a fanaticism, not a formality, not a fin, not a formality, but it's the power of God. That's what we desire. The power of God. So that no glory will go to any man. It's God himself being in control of every situations. Very important to have balance in the scripture. If you're not careful, we will stay on one side. If you're not careful, we will go on the other side. Like I said earlier, remember in many cases there is always a it is also written for the situations. Children obey your parents. You can go on that. But it is also written fathers do not provoke your children. Wives submit to your husband. It is a head. Yes. But it's also written husband love your wives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So always take those two then you have a middle. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible say judge not that you be not judged. But it's also written judge not according to their appearance. Amen. There's a portion where you have to put things clear. So this is wrong things. Don't do that. If you continue that way it will bring you to hell. Amen. &gt;&gt; So people you're judging me. Why you judging? No. The Bible says you have to correct. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Says, "Oh, I'm saved by grace and every form thing is by grace through faith." Yes. The Bible also says that shall show thy faith by works. Amen. Always a balance in every situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now when you have two things I will be closing soon. I've not even started but give me 15 minute 20 minute. The teaching teaching you should not go too long but give me 15 minutes 20 minutes. Is it okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prophet says you say wait I don't know now whether the scripture is just right. Now in Acts 2:38 where Peter said then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Remember it says be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins. And I don't know how to go about it when in Matthew 20 19 Jesus himself said go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father of the son and of the holy ghost. You say I don't. All right I don't I don't I don't understand says then don't add that to nothing because you don't get it. What are you going to do? Because you haven't got knowledge enough to know of God yet that the Bible doesn't contradict itself. Leave it alone. Don't say no more about it. Just leave it alone. I think it's a good advice. Sometimes you you are not called to understand everything at once. Sometimes you can read something and you don't understand. You don't oh say don't don't try to say something negative. Just leave it alone &gt;&gt; and continue. God help me to understand this. But the key to that don't never say the Bible contradict itself. &gt;&gt; You don't understand. But the Bible doesn't contradict itself. Amen. But when you can see himself but when you can see that the scripture is not contradictory then you can say that that that you can say that and can see that by revelation of God the whole world is written in mysteries and only the knowledge of God can reveal it. Then when you get it and say punctuate every word of God with an amen then add that to your favor. We don't understand everything at once. Brother Wam didn't understand everything at once. Sometimes one he was wondering himself about Mark 11:28 says how can a man say to a mountain move. He was wondering I didn't preach that for a long time himself. I didn't preach that for because I couldn't understand how a man not God but a man could pronounce and a mountain could move until one day God revealed that to him. So now I get it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometime we have to be gracious to oursel no or if I don't understand then maybe I'm a foolish virgin. No just pray. He will give himself an advice. You don't understand, leave it alone. But you know that it's the truth. You don't understand, leave it alone. Why brother bam speaks like this here and doesn't that place? I don't understand. Leave it alone. &gt;&gt; Continue your walk with God in simplicity because if we had to understand everything at once, then we will be putting that on ourselves. He not understand himself. How can this man be one is right? He can he can speaks in tongue the other one interpret but one is right the other one is a is a hypocrite how could I he couldn't understand he could not explain it himself a prophet but it took some time and god one time revealed to him the rain can fall on the just and the unjust. &gt;&gt; So it can be anointing on the flesh on someone who's clean and someone who's a hypocrite in the church. So that can happen and God revealed that to him. Oh, now I see him. But the Bible doesn't contradict itself. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What's the secret? Now I believe in genuine Holy Ghost knowledge. Holy Ghost knowledge will always punctuate the word with a amen. &gt;&gt; When you get these things that seem to contradict themselves in the Bible, you sit down and you study it prayerfully like that. And I think that's the key. You have to sit down and study it and prayer in prayer. Maybe sometimes we don't pray enough. &gt;&gt; That's maybe a correction, maybe a rebuke here, but bear with me. Sometimes maybe we don't pray enough. We want to argue enough &gt;&gt; but we don't pray enough. &gt;&gt; We want to find things. Maybe what do you want to say? What do you want to say? But God reveal that to me personally. &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to study. I want to check here. I want to check. We we the word of God is full of of treasure inside of it. But do we study it properly? Do we or we just put it on our ears and a background noise? Oh God help us. Sometimes we have to take time to study the word of God. I'm on the knowledge. You cannot become mature mature without studying the word of God. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying listening the word of God. studying the word of God. &gt;&gt; I remember our early believers, our parents, Caleb's parent and they were taking the word of God. And I still like that because I learned from them. They read it, they analyze it. They're not preachers, but they analyze it. They will ask questions. They will go and search. That those are early believers, strong believers. But now it is shame on us maybe younger one we have oh just background noise or the preacher will handle that and maybe we are not as solid as they were &gt;&gt; listen brother many sermons you will say I'm not trying to put that on dump just something to think about to meditate upon you will be preaching and preaching Those who have not I'm repeating this verse. So for those who write it down, right? But how maybe we don't write down anymore, right? It's just recording. Yeah. But do we listen to it really? I'm just putting questions here. &gt;&gt; Maybe you are skipping that step of knowledge there &gt;&gt; just to rely on other things. But if we become solid, I think we need to know our Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to study our Bible. &gt;&gt; Some people don't even read the Bible. They only read the messages. &gt;&gt; But you can't become a strong believer if you don't read the Bible. &gt;&gt; You have to read the Bible. You know what the message comes from and gives you an anchor. So I know that's the truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You will see you make yourself I give you make yourself a challenge. You take every a time to read the Bible to read the message reading really concentrate. You give yourself 20 minutes you can start 10 minutes 15 minutes whatever time you have but you do that regularly you'll see how your spiritual life will increase will grow. would be a preacher just preaching something here, but what you studied just un unveils itself in a greater way. Oh, I read that. Oh, yeah. It becomes a higher dimension &gt;&gt; than just what the preacher says. One word from the preacher, but because of your studying, that word just multiplies itself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we challenge ourselves a little bit that God let me give you a little bit just a little more time to meditate upon the word of God? Because if you meditate, if you meditate upon the word of God, you will see that there is no other baptism in the Bible outside of the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. So what you are struggling with is why Jesus said here and Peter seems to say something else here. Actually the Bible confirm there is no disciple who ever got baptized in other name but in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. So Peter had to give the revelation of what Jesus Christ says. He said the name of the father of the son of the holy ghost is the name of the lord Jesus Christ. That's the name that represent the name of the father. So the father is the lord Jesus Christ. The son is the lord jesus Christ. The holy spirit is is in his nature but the name of the holy spirit is the lord jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; True. If you meditate prayerfully, you will see that Adam and Eve did not eat an apple as the original seed. But the Eve committed an act that produced Cain from whom the Bible says he was the evil one. &gt;&gt; If you meditate prayerfully, you see that the holiness for believers is required. And I shared that with the young people one time. Even people who are not from the message if they dedicate if they pray and dedicate themselves multiple times and you see that in simplicity they will start dressing decently and modestly &gt;&gt; without hearing brother &gt;&gt; just themselves dedicating themselves you will see that they will start dressing properly &gt;&gt; it's just a fact &gt;&gt; how much more those who can hear what the prophet says &gt;&gt; and you still don't do it may God help us Amen. &gt;&gt; If you want angel to visit you, think on God. Each time you meditate on the word of God, the angel of God are coming there to visit you. The prophet said, "If you want angel to appear to you, keep your mind on God." Jehovah, Jehovah of miracles and of the things of the world. Keep your mind off the things of the world. Go about your business. Go to your church, go to your washing of dishes, wherever you are, keep but keep your mind on him all day and all night long. Then God will do something. You are drawing close to God. Mary had a visitation and she was thinking of God. Amen. Angels being associated together. I hope the prophet I hope you get that and just dropping right now. If you've got the Holy Spirit in you, then you are candidate for association with the unseen world and the supernatural. The angels of God visits you, speaks with them and they are messengers sent from God to reveal and to bring messages from God to the individual. So if you want to have visitation of God, meditate upon the word of God. You want visitation in your house, meditate upon the word of God. I believe before I say that let me say prophet read a prophet quote to me the prophecy he's talking to someone says you know brother banham you are just say what do you do to what did you do to to hypnotize the people and something like that in that angle it says quote to me 1911 act 1911 which says god brought special miracles by the hands of Paul knowledge say he trapped his self right into it actually he was saying you know why do you send those handkerchie chief, what do you do on them? What do you put is it is not scripture. So a prophet is asking quote me Acts 19:11 he says then quote me John 5:14 which says afterward Jesus findeth in him in the temple and said unto him behold thou made whole sin no more unless a worse thing come unto thee couldn't do it and then it says then then James 5:14 if any seek among you let him go for the elers of the church and let them pray over him anoint him anoint him with the oil in the name of the Lord he couldn't do it he couldn't call that then I said, "Do you know John 3:16? For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believe on him should not perish but have everlasting life." They say, "See, smart knowledge, smart world." So let me put down that my command. The prophet was expecting him to know those scriptures. The prophet was expecting him to know those scriptures. We have to know our Bible. Brother Andrew, put me put me there. Put another if you don't mind. We have to know our Bible. I someone sent me long time ago, long time this this video and it kind of I think I took it to encourage my children with that. &gt;&gt; But it's someone. &gt;&gt; Are you a Christian? Is ask are you a Christian? &gt;&gt; Christian. &gt;&gt; Christian. &gt;&gt; Christian. &gt;&gt; Christian. &gt;&gt; Sorry. They're going to be an image that is not proper for the church. Forgive that. What? I'm neither. &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't know, bro. &gt;&gt; So, he's asking, "Can you just give me two scriptures of the Bible?" &gt;&gt; You don't know. &gt;&gt; Are you? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I don't remember. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. No. Two verses. &gt;&gt; Oh, no. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Hard question. &gt;&gt; Um Are you Christian or Muslim? &gt;&gt; I'm Muslim. &gt;&gt; Muslim. &gt;&gt; Muslim. &gt;&gt; Two verses from the Quran. Wow. That is shame for believers. That's shame for Christians. Christians just by name, but you don't know nothing from the Bible. Not even two verses. For me, that hurts me. Like, no. We we are we are doing a poor job. &gt;&gt; We are doing a poor job. We need to we need to start working on our children. We need that's why that's why in in in the Sunday school they have to memorize some verses. &gt;&gt; It's important for them to memorize some verses. When you come to church bring your Bible when you read it stays with you. this screen sometimes it keeps &gt;&gt; okay it's like when we use didn't have those screens we used to know the songs by heart &gt;&gt; when the sister sing the song I'm not done to put myself ahead of that sorry for that I just put the example the French songs I usually know them by heart because we didn't have any presenter everything was just by heart but the English words oh I don't know none of them I have to strike because this p for me I'm not survive because that that screen just takes everything and okay &gt;&gt; cuz I rely on it. But we have to have knowledge of things. Oh God, are we skipping that too much and go to my God help us to help us to know and memorize because the Holy Spirit comes to remind us about the scriptures. Amen. &gt;&gt; But we have to read it so that reminds you. &gt;&gt; If you don't read it, you don't know it. What can it remind you about? Because you don't read it. You don't know it. But when you read it by the God's grace then it reminds you. So you know for that situation this is what you read the other day. This is what the situation you're going through. Oh thank god for that. Oh praise be to God. That's the knowledge. So it's a knowledge that you had to do a part human part but there is a spirit part that comes and take control. Amen. That that that the knowledge of God himself has to do that make that life inside of you. But there's a part where you can do as well a part. Amen. Does it make clear? Many times we go along with a saying that is not part of the word of God many times and I've been victim of that through the years. I just heard that preacher say and becomes a saying and it goes and sometimes becomes like a doctrine. That's right. And then one day you come to let's look at brother B. What did brother Bham said it we never found it. It's like oh how come all these years I've been repeating that it's not brother Bam maybe in the French we have been victim of that more and more. I've been listening to a a very good preacher and I still rely I still love him but through years and when I read it in the English version said wow it doesn't mean that how come we have been all our lives I've been I've been through that it has become just a saying &gt;&gt; but it's not the word of God &gt;&gt; that's true &gt;&gt; but let help us to check on each other a little bit you know you say that where is it where did brab say that where do you think then we will see that we'll become a little more serious than amen. Amen. That was the same thing that happened in time of John the revelator Jesus Christ some of you might not die and what if I say that what if he should not die it became a saying oh John will not die John will not die John will not die John will not die and then when he died oh I'm sure Sam also left the message &gt;&gt; so no &gt;&gt; how can how how can how can how can Billy Brandham die how can he but butam says but why did he Hey, then we look, we look. No, he never said that. Oh, all this year was a saying. Oh, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Help us to have that knowledge that we check things with the word of God and have a foundation that is solid. &gt;&gt; That what we need. Los Angeles. Oh, now it was just a rumor, but that's all that. But we need to know the word of God. Then we'll be able to stand with the word of God. This is one of the this is my quote and and I want to I don't want to leave you that without it. Bam says in exposition of the seven church ages no true believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and alive than his knowledge of and adurance to the pure word of God &gt;&gt; as seen by multitude of examples in the old testament. So the knowledge of God is part of what makes a believer stronger. Without the knowledge of the word of God, you can't be stronger. Without adherence to the pure word of God, you can't be stronger. So the knowledge of God has to bring you to fulfill the word of God. You can't defend your right if you don't know your right. &gt;&gt; You don't if you you can't you can't claim you can't put the enemy out. You can't put Satan out if you don't know your right. You need to know the word of God. So you can stand upon the word of God because Jesus Christ said this in the word of God. Now I put you out because you know you're right. You know your position. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's like when you take a flight, I'll put you an example. Take a flight. You're going to Toronto. You take a an example for you to understand. Take a flight. you go to Toronto and then it's delayed in the middle and then they gave you gave you a free meal but you went to your email they didn't check and you're struggling during the day struggling the day you don't have money right then in the night you come you arrive to Toronto you open your email you find a free ticket there see how angry you'll be so I wasted I suffered all because I didn't know my right same with the word of God. If you don't read it, you don't know it. &gt;&gt; You don't know that you are free. Why the word of God has been open in this age? So that we know our right. We know where we are standing. We know our position. We know where we are staying. Amen. The word of God came to give us the intelligence, give us to give us the perfect knowledge of the word of God on where we standing. The Bible says, "My people are destroyed by lack of knowledge because they have rejected knowledge, I will also reject them." He's talking to the Israel. So knowledge is a very important part of the statue of a perfect man. But once you have knowledge, once you know who you are, you know your Bible, you know where you are standing, I can say you can claim your right. Like the Indian mother, if you open your Bibles, you will find great treasures to supply to all your needs. But you have to open your Bible. If you don't open it, you won't find that there are treasures belonging to your need. You have to open your Bible. But before closing, just to go on the other side, the knowledge is not a knowledge only to know about him. But you have to know him. &gt;&gt; To know him is life. Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's not to know only to know about Christ which is important. But the other step is to know the person of Christ. We need to come to know the person of Christ in the power of the resurrection. Without knowing Christ in the power of the resurrection, there won't be resurrection for you. The resurrection for any person who doesn't come to know Christ in the power of the resurrection to be born again to accept the word of God to obey the word of God then you'll be part of the resurrection. Musicians can come. Amen. Thank you for your patience and for your understanding for the service this morning. little bit teaching but I think it was important for God to prick our heart a little bit. God help us to give you time so that we learn more about you. Thank you. Verse eight song head in a book that I want to see.
