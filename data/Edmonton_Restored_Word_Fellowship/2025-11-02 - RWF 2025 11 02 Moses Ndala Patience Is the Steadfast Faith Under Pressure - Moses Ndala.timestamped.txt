[11:40] our peace. Shalom. God shalom. The king
[11:44] of Melkisedc.
[11:47] A time ago I as a request uh for you
[11:51] saints to pray for me because I had a
[11:54] surgery order of surgery is about my
[11:58] bladder and couple weeks ago I spoke
[12:02] with the urologist.
[12:05] Uh first of all I going to stop here. Uh
[12:08] so this process had been for years
[12:13] and there is a first step that God
[12:18] touched me even when I have not seen my
[12:23] physical healing. It was like four three
[12:28] years ago when I went a special meeting
[12:30] and end time. So I want to mention this
[12:33] because it's a a miracles way that God
[12:37] start to show me what he going to do.
[12:40] Uh, I was h I was in a special meeting
[12:44] and I think brother Roger Spencer was
[12:47] preaching and I was in the upper room
[12:51] and h there was a a sister with a small
[12:56] H gear beside me and I start to praise
[13:01] the Lord. And
[13:04] when when brother Spencer uh was in a
[13:09] very special moment and the Holy Spirit
[13:11] was moving so I feel h something touched
[13:16] me this part of my body like a hand and
[13:20] I I didn't open my h my eyes and I
[13:24] thought that was the the gear that was
[13:27] beside me that was touching me. Then
[13:31] after that I feel like something came to
[13:34] me like a small lime and hit me like
[13:38] lime and with burn. Then well I said
[13:43] something is is happening. But when I
[13:45] open my eyes I realized that the gear
[13:48] was not there anymore was a
[13:53] another another place. So I said it she
[13:57] cannot touch me was something that will
[13:59] happen and even when I I I feel and I
[14:02] had give that testimony to other
[14:05] brothers that was praying and know my
[14:08] situation then
[14:11] years h came everything happened but no
[14:17] realize that that my my healing is is
[14:22] coming right so I keep struggling and
[14:25] struggling. Then I went to to the
[14:27] doctors during co COVID time was worse
[14:30] worse worse. The worst time was there
[14:33] when I went to the hospital and and well
[14:36] I keep doing because it had many areas
[14:41] of my life my my job and has been
[14:45] struggling with that. So I keep going
[14:47] keep going. But when h sometimes here
[14:51] brother Moses sometimes said if somebody
[14:55] sick here raise your hand and I keep
[14:58] claiming claiming receiving
[15:00] &gt;&gt; h now a couple weeks ago to get shorter
[15:04] this testimony I spoke with theologist
[15:07] and she said there is a high probability
[15:11] that you won't going to go to the
[15:12] surgery
[15:14] &gt;&gt; so I expecting h to do another exam of
[15:18] their test h she going to send me to the
[15:21] hospital and that test going to give the
[15:25] final result if I going to go to the
[15:27] surgery and I claiming to go please
[15:29] don't let me go to that surgery because
[15:32] it's six weeks six weeks and I not
[15:35] preparing for that in any way so Lord
[15:38] please touch me and I just confess my
[15:41] healing and said to my body I forcing to
[15:45] my body said accept I accept my healing
[15:50] h forced my body to obey. Uh and then I
[15:54] said to the urologist a couple weeks
[15:57] ago, a couple days ago, I had to go to
[15:59] the body shop to to change my tires h
[16:03] the car and I have to leave the tires by
[16:07] myself and when I leave is when I get
[16:10] worse. So I leave all the all the tires
[16:14] to the car and nothing happened. So I
[16:17] said thank you Lord. I report to the
[16:19] orologist and I waiting for for the
[16:22] complete healing. Thank you Lord.

[32:58] but Jetro Jro is a is a is a
[33:01] father-in-law to Moses and
[33:04] And the pastor is Moses. So I'm happy
[33:06] that
[33:10] you're connected somewhere.
[33:13] Thank God. But he gave good advice to
[33:16] Moses. He told him, you know, it's not
[33:18] good that you everything is upon you.
[33:20] You need to divide the work
[33:23] and then God can use and God came and
[33:25] backed up that that advice. and you he
[33:28] kept Moses wife and he preserved him and
[33:32] then and the children and when they came
[33:34] out of Egypt he went and brought them
[33:36] back to Moses. So very good very good
[33:40] testament for him and the pregnancy u
[33:44] apparently was not was know the sister
[33:47] half not not apparently but the sister
[33:49] half was up and down up and down but in
[33:52] the midst of all that God kept her and
[33:55] kept the child. So we have a miracle
[33:57] child that we have here.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; God's grace manifesting in his life. So
[34:01] we want to commit him his life. Welcome
[34:04] Jetro. And uh we want to commit him to
[34:07] God and pray to him. Just want to read a
[34:09] scripture from the Bible. Mark 10:13
[34:13] 16.
[34:16] We appreciate brother Gabriel and sister
[34:18] Sharon. And uh we love them and thank
[34:22] God for for their life and the
[34:23] testimony. appreciate them and the is
[34:28] the last boy of is joining other three
[34:31] already there but I was telling them
[34:33] it's good they have two two two boys two
[34:36] girls what's a good split the next one
[34:39] that will come it will be a they have to
[34:42] be twins
[34:46] one girl one boy
[34:51] I told them you know it's good we have
[34:54] one church member without me testifying
[34:56] to him. He just just added to the
[34:59] church.
[35:01] That's good.
[35:03] So Mark 10:13
[35:06] just read it from the Bible. I written
[35:08] my note there. Just leave it for the
[35:09] Bible. So we don't baptize children.
[35:13] uh denominations and churches they
[35:16] baptize children but it's not according
[35:18] to scripture because before being
[35:20] baptized you have to repent and
[35:23] recognize your sins but the children as
[35:27] he come there is innocent has no sin of
[35:30] his own to repent of so we just want
[35:33] could commit to the lord Jesus Christ as
[35:35] the bible has declared so 10316 16
[35:47] bear with me for a few moment as we
[35:49] think it also important as God Jesus
[35:52] Christ took time to bless a child. They
[35:55] take a few times for that as well. So
[35:57] Mark 10:13 says and they brought young
[36:00] children to him that he should touch
[36:03] them and his disciple rebuked those who
[36:05] brought them. But when Jesus saw it, he
[36:08] was much displeased and said unto them,
[36:11] "Suffer the little children to come unto
[36:13] me and forbid them not for of such is
[36:17] the kingdom of God." So we should be
[36:20] like children, little children. Amen. If
[36:23] we are like children, they just have
[36:25] genuine faith. They believe everything
[36:28] that God that that that the parents say
[36:31] just take it the way the parents says
[36:34] that how we should also have attitude
[36:35] towards God just believe everything as
[36:38] he's there is the father is holding him
[36:41] is completely depending on the father
[36:44] &gt;&gt; that how we should be depending
[36:46] completely on god and god's word amen
[36:49] verily I say unto you whosoever shall
[36:51] not receive the kingdom of god as a
[36:53] little child he shall not enter therein
[36:56] in and he took them up in his arms and
[36:59] put his hands upon them and he blessed
[37:03] them. So he didn't baptize them, he
[37:05] blessed them. The enemy is not happy but
[37:08] we are going to surround him with the
[37:10] angel of the Lord who was waiting when
[37:12] the mother gave birth. We want that same
[37:14] angel of the Lord to keep watching over
[37:16] him all his life. Amen. going to invite
[37:19] elders
[37:21] and uh and pastor Z
[37:29] is a crying one or
[37:43] &gt;&gt; Let's pray together.

[41:50] on the statue of a perfect man.
[42:09] Second Peter chapter 1.
[42:12] 2 Peter chapter 1 verse 4. and
[42:17] whereby I given unto us exceeding great
[42:19] and precious promises, for by these you
[42:22] might be partakers of the divine nature,
[42:27] having escaped the corruption that is in
[42:29] the world through lust. And beside this,
[42:32] giving all diligence, add to your faith
[42:35] virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to
[42:38] knowledge temperance, and to temperance
[42:40] patience, and to patience godliness, and
[42:44] to godliness, brotherly kindness, and to
[42:47] brotherly kindness charity. And if these
[42:49] things be in you and abound, so they
[42:52] have, they are there, but they have to
[42:54] abound. Let them abound. They make you
[42:57] that you shall neither be barren or nor
[43:01] untruthful in the knowledge of our Lord
[43:03] Jesus Christ. But he that lackth these
[43:06] things is blind and cannot see a far off
[43:09] and have forgotten that he was purged
[43:12] from his old sins. Therefore rather,
[43:16] brethren, give diligence to make your
[43:18] calling and election sure. For if you do
[43:21] these things, you shall never
[43:24] fall. Amen. May God bless you. Let us
[43:27] have a word of prayer for God to open to
[43:30] us. Father Lord, we have read your word.

[44:58] you for your hospitality and how you
[45:02] welcomed him and just a blessing for
[45:04] him. Uh once again I always say this is

[45:31] of God. God bless you for that. And um
[45:34] also uh in 10 days on the 12th, God
[45:38] willing, I'll be traveling to to India
[45:41] missionary work to see the work that
[45:44] dear and precious pastor Zeke and the
[45:46] church and his inspiration and the
[45:48] vision that he had and the work that has
[45:51] been doing over there. So it be good to
[45:53] go and and see and and uh and also grasp
[45:57] the reality of it so that we can uh can
[46:00] can see how we can continue to support
[46:02] them. So we want to salute pastor for
[46:04] for the work and the vision that he had.
[46:07] God bless him richly and uh so want to

[46:20] your to your your gift to your offerings
[46:22] and tithes that we could buy the ticket
[46:25] and afford to go there. So God bless you
[46:28] richly and bless your work and and all
[46:30] that you are doing. Uh the Bible says in
[46:33] heaven you'll have a great reward if you
[46:37] can't go there but you can send someone
[46:39] to go somewhere and you will be sharing
[46:42] the same reward. So God bless you for
[46:44] that. just want to acknowledge what you
[46:46] are doing and thank you. Uh you know
[46:48] sometimes $1 here might not mean
[46:51] anything but $1 somewhere else can do a
[46:55] lot right so um it's good that pastor
[46:59] Zeke identified where the little effort
[47:01] that you can make can have a bigger
[47:03] impact so we want just to salute that
[47:06] and continue to work on that God
[47:08] leadership and God guidance. Amen. And
[47:12] um so God bless you for that. When I
[47:15] come I'll have maybe videos and things
[47:17] to share what you have been doing and
[47:19] how it has been helping. And God bless
[47:22] you for that. Amen. I'll go uh the next
[47:26] uh virtue. Uh I was hoping to finish all
[47:30] this uh
[47:32] before I go to to India but uh it's
[47:35] impossible. So I will come and finish
[47:38] that all that and we have visitors and
[47:40] things like and so it was just just let
[47:42] the god leads. I will touch a little bit
[47:44] today on patience and uh god willing on
[47:48] a comeback and godliness brotherly
[47:50] kindness looking forward to the capstone
[47:54] but uh just go one step at a time. Amen.
[47:58] Those things has to abound in us. Amen.
[48:01] So I would like to take as a title
[48:03] today, patience is the steadfast faith
[48:07] under pressure. Patience is the
[48:10] steadfast faith under pressure. Um long
[48:14] title but it try to make it simple. I'll
[48:18] try to make it simple. I won't be long.
[48:20] Try to make it simple. Patience is a
[48:22] steadfast faith under pressure.
[48:25] Steadfast is a not a words maybe you
[48:27] used to very often said. Oh I don't use
[48:29] very often. It means um is defined as
[48:34] is as dutifully, firm, unwavering, is
[48:38] loyal, faithful, committed, devoted,
[48:41] dedicated, dependable, reliable,
[48:45] steady, true, constant, staunch, trusty,
[48:48] firm, determined, resolute. You want me
[48:51] to keep going on?
[48:56] Impleable, single-minded and changing
[48:59] and wavering and hesitating and
[49:01] faltering and unswerving and yielding
[49:04] and fleeching and flexible and
[49:06] compromising and on and on and on. So
[49:10] that a very good word to be. I think
[49:13] it's very good to have patience and the
[49:16] way it is patience is you know we we we
[49:19] can have as I put the we can have we can
[49:22] have something all of a sudden you can
[49:24] have a little bit of a joy moment you
[49:26] have a little bit of a joy but keep that
[49:29] joy going that's where the problem is
[49:31] right you can have you can have you can
[49:33] have a lot of things you can have a
[49:36] little bit of peace oh everything is
[49:38] fine you as the sister s when everything
[49:40] is going fine oh yeah I have peace this
[49:42] and everything is fine. I feel like I
[49:44] have faith everything is fine. But when
[49:47] keep that keeping is the hardest things
[49:50] you know in the sport there there was
[49:52] just comes to my mind now I think um I
[49:55] think one of the good good players in
[49:57] the past our generation were younger I
[50:00] think it was Michael Jordan whatever it
[50:02] was younger that was how looking so he
[50:05] was saying one one of them said I don't
[50:06] remember who said but he said you know
[50:08] um being the first or the best player of
[50:11] the year is good it's good to be a best
[50:14] player it's wonderful everybody clean
[50:16] but keeping that for the next year next
[50:20] year next year
[50:21] &gt;&gt; that's the hardest thing
[50:23] &gt;&gt; reaching is always okay everybody likes
[50:25] but keeping it that's where it's hard
[50:28] &gt;&gt; and that's the same thing I think in a
[50:30] Christian life
[50:31] &gt;&gt; oh
[50:32] it's good but are you patient enough to
[50:35] keep it that's the problem
[50:38] &gt;&gt; praise be to God so from that that what
[50:40] we have read here it says from what we
[50:43] read in the in the Bible in second
[50:44] Peter's And that word comes from the
[50:47] Greek word. It says
[50:49] it says it says it patience, enduring,
[50:52] patience, continuence, patience. It say
[50:54] steadfastness, consistency,
[50:56] endurance.
[50:58] In the Old Testament, it say the
[51:00] characteristic of a man who is not
[51:01] served from his deliberate purpose and
[51:04] his loyalty to faith and pe and piety by
[51:07] even the greatest trials and suffering.
[51:10] Patiently and steadfastly. patient,
[51:13] steadfast waiting, patient enduring,
[51:16] sustaining perseverance. So this morning
[51:19] I want to show the example of the Bible
[51:20] that patience is the external
[51:22] manifestation of faith. Amen. People can
[51:26] have faith but if it's not accompanied
[51:28] by patience, I believe it's still
[51:30] immature faith because that faith needs
[51:32] to grow to get to the level of stature
[51:34] of a perfect man. And if you don't have
[51:37] patience, then that faith is not mature
[51:40] enough. Amen. The Bible says or the
[51:42] prophet says in the statue of a perfect
[51:44] man said. Then after that fourthly you
[51:47] want to add patience to your faith. If
[51:49] you got faith it workketh of patience.
[51:52] The Bible said and see. So so this is
[51:55] patience and that is the next thing is
[51:57] going to build this teacher. You know
[51:59] God has got real material in this
[52:02] building.
[52:06] God has real material in this building.
[52:09] And one of them is patience. Praise be
[52:13] to God.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; And it says how short we are brothers
[52:17] and sisters. See why? Where are where we
[52:19] at? Yes sir. We have glory. We have
[52:22] shouts and things because we got faith.
[52:25] But when come down to those things here,
[52:27] God can't build us onto that stature.
[52:30] See, he can't. He can't make us up to
[52:32] that kind of a place. We got all these
[52:35] other things. We fall and slide off with
[52:37] it. See, he can't build his church. In
[52:40] other words, he can't build his church
[52:42] without patience. Patience with what?
[52:44] What kind of patience? First thing is
[52:47] had patience is had patience with God.
[52:51] If you've got real genuine faith, you've
[52:53] you'll already have genuine patience
[52:56] because faith workketh patience. When
[52:59] God says anything, you believe it.
[53:01] That's it. You got patience. Well, I
[53:03] asked him last night to heal me and I'm
[53:05] just as sick this morning. Oh my, what
[53:08] patience
[53:10] himself say? God told Abraham 25 years
[53:13] later there wasn't even one sign. He was
[53:16] still believing. He was patient with
[53:19] God.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; So put him always before you. Let him be
[53:24] the next let him be the let him be the
[53:27] next crossing things. You can't cross
[53:29] him. Just keep him before you. He said
[53:33] so and it's going to happen. Keep him
[53:35] before you. That right.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; And then it goes on. It takes Noah had
[53:40] patience. Noah had really real godly
[53:43] patience. God said, "I'm going to
[53:44] destroy this world with rain." And Noah
[53:47] preached 120 years yet plenty of
[53:50] patience. Not even Jew fell from heaven.
[53:53] Wasn't nothing. just as dusty as it ever
[53:56] was for 120 years. But he was patience.
[54:01] He was patient. Then God tries your
[54:04] patience. The prophet says God tries
[54:06] your patience. That's right. God tries
[54:09] them. Praise be to God.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; I believe that patience deals with the
[54:15] actual element that God put us in
[54:18] because patience comes to our level.
[54:20] Amen. You know it patience come to I
[54:23] like what brother actually brother Boris
[54:25] preached already this message I would
[54:27] say on Saturday when he preached here it
[54:29] was actually this message of patience so
[54:32] I'll just repeat some of the things but
[54:35] God put us patience touches the element
[54:37] of where we are in
[54:39] &gt;&gt; it is time patience time touch the
[54:42] element of time
[54:44] &gt;&gt; as long as there is no time things will
[54:47] be so easy because you'll get it
[54:49] instantaneously you all the anything or
[54:51] you see developing anything anything you
[54:53] see the developing and you get it right
[54:55] away that's that but when the time
[54:58] element comes in that's where the
[55:01] problem comes but God as brother brother
[55:04] Boris put it so well God himself
[55:07] that was God intention to put the
[55:09] element of time we come from eternity we
[55:12] go into the element of time and then we
[55:14] go back to eternity everything is fine
[55:17] when it was eternity
[55:19] &gt;&gt; no one complains all shouting and
[55:21] everything of joy that way of
[55:23] everything's fine. After time everything
[55:26] will be fine. No complaining. It will be
[55:29] eternal joy. There is no tomorrow.
[55:31] Everything is now. Everything is now.
[55:34] Everything is perfect between those two
[55:36] things. But in the middle there that
[55:39] were time and that were problem. But it
[55:42] was God INTENTION TO PUT TIME. Time so
[55:46] that why put time there? So that we can
[55:48] be tested. We bypassed our theophony in
[55:51] order to be tested. God put us in time
[55:55] for that. But we have to recognize the
[55:58] same God of eternity is the same God
[56:01] during the time. It will be the same God
[56:03] after time. That's why he put IS THE
[56:06] ALPHA AND THE OMEGA.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; GOD IS NOT BOUND BY TIME. AMEN. WE ARE
[56:10] LIMITED BY THE TIME and that's where the
[56:13] problem is. The prophet will say even
[56:15] further. says you know there is where
[56:18] sight and time is God worst's enemy in
[56:21] divine healing you know the worst enemy
[56:23] in our Christian walk is ourself
[56:25] &gt;&gt; but I believe in and God promises one of
[56:28] the greatest enemy is time
[56:31] &gt;&gt; because we want to put time on things on
[56:34] I want it to be happening so quick I
[56:36] want it to be happening now I want it
[56:38] happening tomorrow if if it's not
[56:40] tomorrow AND THEN YOU PUT DEADLINE TO
[56:42] GOD WHEN YOU PUT DEADLINE TO GOD that's
[56:45] where There is a problem
[56:48] &gt;&gt; and the enemy want to come upon TIME TO
[56:50] USE TO WHEN HE'S THROWING US IS COMING
[56:52] UPON time you know you know God promised
[56:54] you this why why is it not happening why
[56:56] you don't see a change why you don't see
[56:58] that so he's REMINDING YOU ABOUT THE
[57:00] TIME BECAUSE THAT the only time he has
[57:02] to work on AFTER THIS TIME HE CAN'T WORK
[57:05] ON BUT may God give us patience
[57:08] &gt;&gt; just wait upon the Lord just wait upon
[57:11] God's promises those who wait upon the
[57:13] Lord shall renew their strength.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Just wait upon the Lord. HE KNOWS THE
[57:18] RIGHT TIME. HE KNOWS WHEN HE'S GOING TO
[57:20] FULFILL HIS WORD. GOD IS IN CONTROL OF
[57:23] EVERY SITUATION. He's the God of the
[57:25] mountain. He's the God of the valley.
[57:27] He's the God OF ETERNITY. HE KNOWS
[57:29] EVERYTHING.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; AND JUST TO recognize that and I want to
[57:33] put that emphasis so much this morning
[57:35] to this morning, I want you to recognize
[57:38] today if you are standing, you are an
[57:40] overcomer. As brother Maurice put so
[57:42] well. Let me put the reminder to you.
[57:44] Today if you are standing you ARE AN
[57:46] OVERCOMER.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; THE FACT THAT YOU ARE STILL GETTING
[57:49] HOLDING ON GOD PROMISE EVEN THOUGH YOU
[57:51] DON'T SEE IT HAPPENING YET YOU ARE AN
[57:53] OVERCOMER.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; So you HAVE TO SAY BOO TO THE DEVIL.
[57:56] DEVIL I DON'T SEE IT YET BUT I'M STILL
[57:58] STANDING ON GOD promise
[58:00] &gt;&gt; because I'm waiting PATIENTLY ON GOD'S
[58:03] promise
[58:04] &gt;&gt; to be fulfilled.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; The message the trial message is
[58:08] wonderful message. The prophet has
[58:10] preached many times. In the trial
[58:12] message
[58:13] there is a case again against God. Satan
[58:16] is not using
[58:19] is not using bad bad people like worldly
[58:23] people to present in the case. You know
[58:25] there is a he put it a case. So there is
[58:27] a a prosecutor attorney you call it is
[58:31] the one who bring the charge is the
[58:32] Satan and then Satan is bringing his
[58:35] witnesses and then God has to come and
[58:38] also bring his witnesses on the other
[58:40] side. So the witnesses that Satan is
[58:42] bringing to the case that God's word is
[58:44] not true. Look at those three types of
[58:47] witnesses that he's taking.
[58:50] The prophet says you understand it's a
[58:52] case against God that he will bring
[58:55] three people. Mr. Unbelief
[58:59] and Mr. Skeptic.
[59:02] Those are easy to identify
[59:05] &gt;&gt; because as a Christian is easy to
[59:07] identify. Oh, he's just Mr. Unbelief. He
[59:10] doesn't even believe God. So what
[59:12] whatever God says and I say no I don't
[59:14] believe God and I don't believe in that.
[59:16] No no no why are you taking you argue
[59:19] and you just classify him. So this is an
[59:20] unbeliever. There's no let just wait
[59:22] until God touch his heart otherwise you
[59:25] can't try to convince him because it has
[59:27] to go there. Amen. You take another
[59:29] skeptic. The other one is a skeptic is
[59:31] one who believes partially. is kind of
[59:35] sometimes I'm skeptical but I can give
[59:37] it a try and let's see how it can work.
[59:40] Yeah. Are you with me? Just just let me
[59:42] take those examples. An unbeliever. The
[59:44] prophet says they call first one of the
[59:46] witness says Mr. unbeliever. He
[59:48] complains this all of God's promises
[59:50] word is not true. So he's rejecting
[59:52] everything. Now he's going to be tried
[59:54] for this. Listen. says he claims
[59:58] Mark 16 was ministering to me in
[1:00:00] so-called Holy Ghost meeting where
[1:00:01] others claimed to be getting healed and
[1:00:04] that was ministering to me two years ago
[1:00:06] and there is no difference in me yet
[1:00:08] this science does not follow the
[1:00:09] believer he said he made this claim
[1:00:11] against him said I I just there I don't
[1:00:14] believe it because this was to me and
[1:00:17] that's it I reject it the skeptic he
[1:00:19] takes the scripture of God's words of
[1:00:21] James 5:16 he says it was in place where
[1:00:24] they claimed that held were called and
[1:00:26] he was anointed with oil and prayed over
[1:00:28] that was over a month and there's been
[1:00:30] no change in in him yet. So he knows
[1:00:32] that that's wrong. He's calling God and
[1:00:34] indicting God for it. Now the third one
[1:00:38] is Mr. Impatient
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; and the prophet says he's the cruel one
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; because Mr. Impatient can be for a
[1:00:46] moment a believer.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; For a moment Mr. Impatient is a
[1:00:51] believer. He says God says this or I
[1:00:53] believe what God says. He can even say
[1:00:56] hallelujah. Praise be to God.
[1:00:59] Hallelujah. PRAISE BE I ACCEPT IT. I
[1:01:01] BELIEVE IT. In the in the prayer meeting
[1:01:04] we have brother say you can have a
[1:01:05] prostitute comes and she has faith. She
[1:01:07] has a burst of faith and she believes
[1:01:09] and she's healed constantly and she goes
[1:01:12] back. She's healed more than the
[1:01:14] sometimes the believer is there because
[1:01:16] the believer knows the word of God say
[1:01:18] oh that I made a mistake there. I made a
[1:01:19] mistake there. I don't qualify for
[1:01:21] healing. And he's, you know, he's
[1:01:23] putting himself down and he's rejecting
[1:01:25] God's promise because he's condemning
[1:01:27] himself, not believing in what the word
[1:01:29] of God is saying, if you repent, all
[1:01:31] your sins are forgiven.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; But the other one who comes and he just
[1:01:34] believe that God is the healer. Accept
[1:01:36] and he's healed. And I say, "Oh, but how
[1:01:39] come I didn't get it?" And because you
[1:01:41] didn't grasp the promise for you, you
[1:01:42] need to grab the promise. But the one
[1:01:44] who got healed and go back
[1:01:48] doesn't stay Christian. There's a you
[1:01:52] can believe but you have to stay a
[1:01:53] believer. That's where the problem is.
[1:01:55] Are you with me?
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; So in Mark 11:12 the prophet says so he
[1:01:59] says in the trial message the next
[1:02:01] witness is Mr. Impatient. He's a noful
[1:02:04] guy. All right. Mr. Impatient. He claims
[1:02:06] that he read out God's word in Mark
[1:02:09] 11:12 and 13. that when if you prayed,
[1:02:12] if you believe that what you have
[1:02:13] prayed, you receive, you shall have what
[1:02:15] you asked for. And he say that he asked
[1:02:17] to lay down his crutches after he read
[1:02:20] the word and asked God to heal them and
[1:02:22] he asked to lay down its crutches and
[1:02:25] that that's been five years ago. He's
[1:02:28] never been able to lay them down since.
[1:02:31] So they claim God is not justified in
[1:02:33] putting such rash promises in his word.
[1:02:36] Now do you understand the case now
[1:02:38] against God prophecy? is not justified
[1:02:40] in doing that placing such scriptures
[1:02:42] Mark 113
[1:02:45] 2223 Mark 16 James 5:14 and such
[1:02:48] promises that they're inducting God
[1:02:51] because of a breach of promise he has
[1:02:54] broken his promise he's not able to
[1:02:55] stand by they're inducting him for
[1:02:58] putting such in his word then the
[1:03:00] prophet says as a message say God will
[1:03:02] take also another the one who's going to
[1:03:04] defend himself he's going to take the
[1:03:06] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is going to
[1:03:08] come and he's going going to defend
[1:03:09] himself. The Holy Ghost is going to call
[1:03:12] upon his own witnesses.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says God fortify his
[1:03:18] children behind his word. And the very
[1:03:20] first thing you step from behind it, you
[1:03:23] are target to the devil. He can't get
[1:03:26] you as long as you are fortified by the
[1:03:28] word. The promise I want you your
[1:03:31] attention. Now, this is the defense
[1:03:33] witness, the Holy Ghost. The promise is
[1:03:35] only to believers, not make believers,
[1:03:39] not skeptics, not unbelievers.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; So the promise of God only applies to
[1:03:44] those who believe.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; If you don't believe, YOU CAN'T HAVE THE
[1:03:48] BENEFIT OF THE WORD OF GOD. BUT IF YOU
[1:03:50] STAND BEHIND THE WORD OF GOD, YOU ARE
[1:03:52] FORTIFIED BY THE WORD OF GOD. SO STAND
[1:03:55] ALL THE TIME BEHIND THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:03:58] THAT'S YOUR STRENGTH. AMEN. THE PROMISE
[1:04:00] IS ONLY TO THE BELIEVERS, NOT TO OTHERS.
[1:04:02] Now this is the defense witness. The
[1:04:04] defense witness should know because he
[1:04:07] is the one that quickens it to them and
[1:04:09] he knows whether it is true or not. Says
[1:04:12] if you want he also want to call the
[1:04:14] attention here being the quickener of
[1:04:16] the word he also calls the attention the
[1:04:18] word is a seed. The word is a seed.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; The word when the when you receive the
[1:04:25] word of God I like that interpretation.
[1:04:28] The word is the seed.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; The word is the seed. It's wonderful
[1:04:37] because
[1:04:43] okay, I wanted to put this comment
[1:04:44] before I go there, but I will go there.
[1:04:47] The prophet says the word never said
[1:04:49] when he said he would. Yeah.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "I will give you a child to to
[1:04:55] Abraham's son by Sarah next month." Not
[1:04:58] next month. He never said next month. He
[1:05:00] said he would. Not when. The prayer they
[1:05:03] shall lay hands on the sick. They shall
[1:05:05] recover. That's the idea. The prayer of
[1:05:07] faith shall save the sick and God shall
[1:05:10] raise him up. Terry in the city of
[1:05:13] Jerusalem until you endured with power
[1:05:15] on high. Not for one day, not two hours,
[1:05:18] not 10 days, not 10, not 10 years. says
[1:05:21] a real defense witness. This fellow I
[1:05:24] never said would have the baby would
[1:05:26] would have the baby. Abraham said he
[1:05:28] would have it all the time. The odds was
[1:05:30] bleeding against him. He stayed there
[1:05:32] because he didn't stagger an unbelief of
[1:05:35] God. He held on. What I want to put the
[1:05:38] emphasis here. It's when the prophet
[1:05:40] says the problem is when we put a when
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; God I want this promise or I'm relying
[1:05:46] on the promise promise until
[1:05:49] next year. If I'm not next year, then
[1:05:52] that's it. I leave.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; You You don't see those who have been
[1:05:57] the message for a long time, they knows
[1:05:59] it, right?
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; You see a sister there that have been
[1:06:01] there been waiting for marriage. I've
[1:06:02] been waiting for marriage and waiting
[1:06:04] for marriage. One year, two years in her
[1:06:07] mind, she already put three years. If
[1:06:08] there's no three years, I go back to the
[1:06:10] world.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; After three years, she go back to the
[1:06:13] world
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; because God didn't answer that in three
[1:06:16] years.
[1:06:18] Oh my dear sister.
[1:06:21] No, stay. Wait patiently.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; God knows.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Don't break the word of God because of
[1:06:27] time.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; It was not my note but just
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; the problem comes when we put time.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Just rely on God knows the right time.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; The enemy will work on time. We know he
[1:06:43] works on the flesh. Oh, and the other
[1:06:46] next enemy is the time.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; He will work on time space. If you don't
[1:06:50] get this job next month, you know, quit.
[1:06:53] You know that that thing God is not
[1:06:54] answering. He's not hearing. No, just
[1:06:56] stay there. Just commit him to the Lord
[1:06:59] and stay believing in God.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; And then you go to the seed. The word of
[1:07:03] God is a seed.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Is a seed has to follow into the ground.
[1:07:07] When it follows into the ground, what
[1:07:09] you have to do is to water that ground
[1:07:11] all the time. God, I thank you for your
[1:07:14] promise. I thank you for your grace. I
[1:07:16] thank you for you healing me. I thank
[1:07:18] you FOR YOU GUIDING ME. I DON'T PUT ANY
[1:07:20] TIME AT GOD IN HIS OWN TIME THAT SEED IS
[1:07:23] GOING TO COME OUT AND PRODUCE THE FRUIT.
[1:07:26] AMEN. YOU DON'T DETERMINE THE SEED. YOU
[1:07:28] SEE IF YOU DON'T COME TOMORROW I'm going
[1:07:30] to take you out. You're not a seed.
[1:07:31] You're not a REAL SEED. NO, YOU ARE
[1:07:34] FAILING. AMEN.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; ANOTHER MESSAGE THE PROPHET says if you
[1:07:37] put a seed don't go each morning and AND
[1:07:40] TAKE IT OUT from the the soil AND LOOK
[1:07:42] IT. ARE YOU WORKING OR NOT WORKING? AND
[1:07:44] THEN PUT IT BACK AGAIN and tomorrow COME
[1:07:47] YOU TAKE IT OUT. ARE YOU I PUT IT YOU
[1:07:48] ARE YOU WORKING OR NOT WORKING? NO, YOU
[1:07:51] ARE YOU ARE WORKING AGAINST NATURE.
[1:07:53] YOU'RE WORKING AGAINST GOD'S WORD. PUT
[1:07:56] IT UNDER THE SOUL AND WATER WE GOD
[1:07:59] PROMISES. GOD I THANK YOU. GOD I PRAISE
[1:08:02] YOU. GOD I CONFESS YOUR WORD IS THE
[1:08:05] TRUTH. AS A SISTER CONFESS THIS BODY
[1:08:08] WILL BE OBEDIENT TO THE CONFESSION OF MY
[1:08:10] MOUTH BECAUSE THE WORD OF GOD IS TRUE
[1:08:13] WHEN TOMORROW I DON'T KNOW AFTER

[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; AND NEXT YEAR IT DOESN'T HAPPEN PRAISE

[1:08:34] BE A GREATER MIRACLE
[1:08:36] 25 YEARS PASSED. ABRAHAM, YOU SAID YOU
[1:08:39] ARE THE FATHER OF MANY NATIONS. WHERE IS
[1:08:41] THE SON?
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD. I WILL HAVE ONE.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; HOW COME? BECAUSE GOD SAID SO.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; I'M PATIENTLY WAITING. AMEN.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; WAITING UPON THE LORD OF GOD.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; PUTTING THE SEED. AMEN.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; But Mr. impatient
[1:08:59] says, God, I believed you, but the time
[1:09:01] is too long.
[1:09:05] One year is too much. Lord, I can't wait
[1:09:07] for one year.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; But God is not bound by time.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Actually, time is testing us.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; That's why he put timeested memorials.
[1:09:24] Our Christian life is just time.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Time is testing us.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; If you are good, oh, time will show up
[1:09:32] over here.
[1:09:34] like
[1:09:37] [Laughter]
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:54] So the word is a seed. So let's let's
[1:09:56] let's go let's go to to Matthew 23.
[1:10:00] Matthew 13. Thank you, sir.
[1:10:35] This is the parable of of the of of the
[1:10:38] ser. It says
[1:10:41] verse 18 says, "Hear he therefore the
[1:10:44] parable of the of the swer. When anyone
[1:10:47] heareth the word of the kingdom and
[1:10:49] understandeth not, then cometh the
[1:10:51] wicked one and catches away that which
[1:10:53] was sown in his heart. This is he which
[1:10:56] received the seed by the wayside. So pro
[1:10:59] Jesus Christ put there
[1:11:03] I think I can just put the
[1:11:04] interpretation of it. So you put by the
[1:11:06] so the different kind of different kind
[1:11:09] different different kind of soil
[1:11:10] different kind of ground different
[1:11:11] ground the seed is sowed into those
[1:11:14] ground by first one is by the wayside.
[1:11:16] So Jesus Christ himself is giving
[1:11:18] interpretation to the disciples.
[1:11:21] Everybody heard through parables but
[1:11:24] thank God he had a group of disciples
[1:11:26] who came and asked the Jesus Christ, can
[1:11:28] you give us the interpretation of those
[1:11:30] parables? And Jesus Christ says, you are
[1:11:33] special people. Verse 12, you are
[1:11:35] special people. Many prophets and
[1:11:36] righteous men have desired to hear those
[1:11:38] things and to see those things, but
[1:11:40] they've not seen them. And to hear those
[1:11:43] things which you hear have not heard
[1:11:44] them. But you, God has given you a
[1:11:47] special grace. The same thing for the
[1:11:50] message of the hour. Many people have
[1:11:52] heard, many people read the Bible, but
[1:11:54] they can't see, they can't see the
[1:11:56] revelation that you and I have because
[1:11:58] it is special people. Amen. Quality God
[1:12:01] can give you the revelation of the word
[1:12:02] of God. Now he says those who fell from
[1:12:05] the wayside, it's those those they
[1:12:07] receive, they heard the word of God in
[1:12:09] the kingdom and but they understood it
[1:12:11] not. Then the wicked one comes and takes
[1:12:14] it away. And he likes to do that. You
[1:12:17] know, you hear the word of God, you
[1:12:19] don't understand, you questioning the
[1:12:20] word of God, he comes, he take that the
[1:12:22] word of God away from you. And then the
[1:12:24] second one say, he that receive the seed
[1:12:26] in stony place is the same is the same
[1:12:28] that hears the word of God and and a non
[1:12:31] with joy receive it. He received the
[1:12:33] word of God, but he has no root in
[1:12:36] himself but endures for a while. Listen
[1:12:39] to this. For when tribulation and
[1:12:41] persecution ariseth because of the word
[1:12:45] of God, by and by he is offended. Says,
[1:12:49] "Oh, but I receive the word of God. I
[1:12:52] got baptized or I go to that church or I
[1:12:54] listen to the prophet, but when why why
[1:12:57] tribulation? Why persecution? Why these
[1:12:59] things are arising? Why I'm being
[1:13:00] persecuted at school? Why I'm being
[1:13:02] persecuted at home? Why things are
[1:13:03] happen becoming difficult?" And then you
[1:13:06] start putting the word of God and that
[1:13:08] word of God maybe doesn't apply to me.
[1:13:10] It still applies to you. It's the seed
[1:13:12] of God but it needs to find root in in
[1:13:14] yourself. Amen. It says he also that
[1:13:17] receive the seed among the thorns is he
[1:13:19] that heareth the word and the care of
[1:13:22] this world and the deceitful of riches
[1:13:25] choke the word and he becometh
[1:13:27] unfruitful.
[1:13:29] So he has received the word of God but
[1:13:31] because of the things and deceitful of
[1:13:33] the world and the care of this world it
[1:13:36] choke the word of God. Is it the fault
[1:13:38] of the word of God? No.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; The problem is the ground and how we are
[1:13:42] taking care of the ground
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; and how we are letting the influence of
[1:13:46] the outside influence that seed and it
[1:13:49] choke the word of God and it BECOMES
[1:13:51] UNFRUITFUL. HERE'S THE WORD of God but
[1:13:53] not unfruitful. But he that receiveth
[1:13:56] seed into the good ground is he that
[1:13:58] heareth the word and understand it which
[1:14:01] also beareth fruit and bring forth some
[1:14:04] and 100folds some 60 some 30. I believe
[1:14:08] in this church are those who have
[1:14:10] received the word of God in the right
[1:14:11] ground
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; IN THE RIGHT SOIL. AMEN. YOU MIGHT NOT
[1:14:14] PRODUCE 100 BUT YOU AS YOU ARE PRODUCING
[1:14:17] 30 GOD IS PRAISING YOU AND THANKING YOU.
[1:14:20] THANK YOU FOR STANDING ON THE WORD OF
[1:14:22] GOD. THANK YOU FOR BEING PATIENT ALL
[1:14:24] THESE YEARS THROUGH UPS AND DOWNS. THE
[1:14:26] FACT THAT YOU ARE HERE, YOU ARE AN
[1:14:28] OVERCOMER. AMEN.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; THE FACT THAT YOU ARE HERE, THE SEED
[1:14:32] WENT IN THE RIGHT GROUND. AMEN.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER THE DIFFICULTY, NO MATTER THE
[1:14:36] DECEPTION OF THE WORLD, YOU KEEP
[1:14:37] standing on the word OF GOD.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; STAYING PATIENT WITH GOD. AMEN.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Because you are not a being of time
[1:14:46] only.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; People fail because they only focus on
[1:14:49] the time. They think okay my time on
[1:14:51] earth just live and be happy because
[1:14:54] that the only time I have. NO THE TIME
[1:14:57] IS YOU ARE NOT PART OF THE TIME. YOU ARE
[1:14:59] PART OF ETERNITY.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; LET YOUR DECISION BE MADE BECAUSE BASED
[1:15:04] ON THE ETERNITY NOT ON THE TIME.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; IF YOU MAKE YOUR DECISION BASED ON THE
[1:15:09] TIME YOU ARE BOUND TO FAIL BUT THANK GOD
[1:15:12] YOU ARE MAKING YOUR DECISIONS BASED ON
[1:15:14] ETERNITY FROM WHERE YOU COME FROM AND
[1:15:17] FROM WHERE YOU ARE GOING. AMEN.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU STAY PATIENT. AMEN.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Now, that's the thought of the seed. And
[1:15:27] if the seed falls in the right, the
[1:15:30] prophet continued the trial. Fertile
[1:15:32] ground, it will produce exactly what God
[1:15:34] said it will do. But it fell in the
[1:15:37] right kind of ground. So there is not
[1:15:40] soil enough, faith enough to make the
[1:15:42] seed grow. I think as the one who
[1:15:44] quickened the seed, he ought to know.
[1:15:46] Don't you think so? How many believes
[1:15:47] that?
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Congregation says, "Amen."
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; It should be the one who knows it. He's
[1:15:52] the real defense witness. Amen. Praise
[1:15:56] be to God.
[1:15:58] Although I had that fellow said the Holy
[1:16:00] Ghost will call Noah. I had that fellow
[1:16:03] on the witness stand here a while ago.
[1:16:06] Mr. Unbeliever is called me all the
[1:16:09] time. This Noah testifying. He made fun
[1:16:12] of me. I've seen Mr. Ceptic. He come
[1:16:14] around and he laughed at me. I've seen
[1:16:17] Mr. Impatient, all of them, they laughed
[1:16:19] at me for believing in such a miracle.
[1:16:21] But I waited. When I finished the ark,
[1:16:24] the rain never came. I waited for 120
[1:16:27] years before it came. But it came. Amen.
[1:16:30] But finally, it came.
[1:16:32] Do you know what message Noah had?
[1:16:36] It's going to rain.

[1:20:13] impatient
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; and you are going to be on the other
[1:20:16] side. I believed it, but I took a little

[1:20:51] potatoes, but also you are you are also
[1:20:54] working as knowing that he can come
[1:20:56] tomorrow.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Don't only plant your potatoes and you
[1:20:59] forgot about God. Amen. Some also don't
[1:21:02] that just be there and they forget the
[1:21:04] potatoes. You also need to plant the
[1:21:06] potatoes both ways. Amen. BUT MAKE SURE
[1:21:09] THAT AS YOU ARE PLANTING YOUR POTATO,
[1:21:11] YOU HAVE YOUR WEAPON WITH YOU. YOU ARE
[1:21:13] READY FOR ANY TIME.

[1:21:17] DON'T POSTPONE IT TO ANOTHER TIME.
[1:21:19] REPENT TODAY. AMEN. THIS IS YOUR DAY.
[1:21:22] AMEN.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Second Peter 3,
[1:21:29] Peter is saying it so well here.
[1:21:30] Beloved, be not ignorant this one thing
[1:21:33] that one day is with the Lord as a
[1:21:35] thousand years and a thousand years as
[1:21:37] one day. The Lord is not stuck. The Lord
[1:21:41] is not slack concerning his promise as
[1:21:44] some man count slackness, but is
[1:21:46] long-suffering to ask word, not willing
[1:21:49] that any should perish, but that all
[1:21:51] should come to repentance.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; But the day of the Lord will come as a
[1:21:56] thief in the night, in the which the he
[1:21:58] the heavens shall pass away with a great
[1:22:01] noise, and the element shall melt with
[1:22:03] fervent heat. the earth also and the
[1:22:06] works that are therein shall be burned
[1:22:08] up. Seeing that all these things shall
[1:22:12] be dissolved, what manner of persons
[1:22:15] ought ye to be in all holy conversation
[1:22:18] and godliness?
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Looking for and hasting in unto the
[1:22:23] coming of the day of God, wherein the
[1:22:25] heavens being on fire shall be
[1:22:27] dissolved, and the elements shall melt
[1:22:29] with fervent heat. Nevertheless, we
[1:22:32] according to his promise look for new
[1:22:35] heavens and new earth dwelling wherein
[1:22:37] dwelleth righteousness. That's where we
[1:22:40] are looking. There will be a new heaven
[1:22:41] and new earth. That's where our promise
[1:22:44] is. We are looking for a new place. This
[1:22:46] is not our home. Amen. This is not our
[1:22:49] dwelling place. Our dwelling place is to
[1:22:51] be WITH THE LORD FOREVER. THAT WAS HIS
[1:22:53] DESIRE AND HE PUT THAT DESIRE INSIDE OF
[1:22:56] US. SO WE HAVE THE SAME DESIRE. AMEN.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; DON'T POSTPONE THINGS. Don't put on
[1:23:01] things for the for the future and leave
[1:23:02] your life. Your life has to BE FOR GOD.
[1:23:05] THAT TIME THAT GOD CREATED is for him.
[1:23:07] Amen.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Not for yourself. FOR HIM
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; TO SERVE him in this portion of time.
[1:23:13] I like that portion that that I say
[1:23:15] there. I lost it. But I like that
[1:23:17] portion. It says, you know, he will come
[1:23:18] as a thief. God will come as a thief to
[1:23:21] people who are not expecting it.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; That's how a thief comes. A thief come
[1:23:27] when you're not expecting it. You are
[1:23:29] well sleeping and sleeping and then the
[1:23:32] morning. Hey, what happened?
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Too late.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:23:38] I couldn't hear anything. They bewitched
[1:23:41] me.
[1:23:42] No, he used to say, "Oh, that thief be
[1:23:45] No, otherwise I could have heard it. He
[1:23:47] bewitched me. I couldn't see it. I
[1:23:48] couldn't hear anything." No, you were
[1:23:50] just sleeping.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; You're not expecting him to come.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; That's right. But if he warns you that
[1:23:57] I'm coming, no, no matter what what kind
[1:24:00] of bewitching he's got, you are waiting
[1:24:01] for him because he promised that I'm
[1:24:03] coming.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; So he's going to come to a thief to
[1:24:06] those who are not waiting for him.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; But thank God for he has given us a
[1:24:10] warning.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; We are living in the end time, the end
[1:24:14] of the end time.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; He has given us signs to see and watch.
[1:24:17] And when you see those signs being
[1:24:19] fulfilled, know ye that the end is
[1:24:21] there. THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS NEAR. AMEN.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE RECEIVED THE LAST MESSENGER.
[1:24:27] THAT'S THE SIGN FOR THE CHURCH. THAT THE
[1:24:29] SIGN TO THE BRIDE.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE RECEIVED OUR WARNING. SO GET
[1:24:33] READY TODAY. LET YOUR LAMP BE TRIMMED
[1:24:36] TODAY. BE WATCHFUL. AMEN. BECAUSE HE'S
[1:24:39] COMING. AMEN. IT'S ACTUALLY let me say
[1:24:42] the cycle of his coming is already here.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; THE WORD OF GOD HAS BEEN UNVEILED. OUR
[1:24:47] BRIDEGROOM. THE WORD OF GOD IS ALREADY
[1:24:49] HERE. SO WE ARE WALKING IN THAT TIME OF
[1:24:52] THE COMING OF THE LORD. IT'S NOT FOR A
[1:24:54] LONG TIME ANYMORE. EVEN IF IT IS 20
[1:24:56] YEARS AGO, 20 YEARS IN THE FUTURE, IT'S
[1:24:58] STILL NOT LONG. 20 YEARS IS JUST NOTHING
[1:25:01] FOR GOD. AMEN. YOU STAY FAITHFUL. AMEN.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; IT MIGHT BE YOUR DAY, MIGHT BE TODAY. WE
[1:25:06] DON'T KNOW WHAT can happen when you come
[1:25:07] out of this. It might be your hand.
[1:25:09] AMEN. WE DON'T KNOW.
[1:25:11] SO YOU BE READY. AMEN.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; DON'T LEAVE THE impatient life. No. Be
[1:25:16] live as a patient. Patient waiting
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; constantly.
[1:25:24] So wherefore, beloved, seeing that you
[1:25:26] look for such thing, be diligent that
[1:25:28] you may be found in him in peace without
[1:25:30] spot and blameless and account that the
[1:25:34] longsuffering of our Lord is salvation,
[1:25:36] even as our beloved brother Paul also
[1:25:39] according to the wisdom given unto him
[1:25:41] had written unto you. as also in all his
[1:25:45] epistles speaking in them of these
[1:25:47] things in which are some things hard to
[1:25:50] be understood which they that are
[1:25:53] unlearned and unstable rest as they do
[1:25:56] also the other scriptures unto their own
[1:25:59] destruction this is a good scripture if
[1:26:02] people come why why you are following a
[1:26:04] man and everything no we are not
[1:26:05] following a man we're following the Lord
[1:26:06] Jesus Christ
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; but Lord Jesus Christ has given us thank
[1:26:10] God has given us a seer Amen.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Someone who can warn us ahead
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; like Peter by God's grace he walked with
[1:26:18] Jesus Christ in the flesh
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; but he recognized no God has sent a
[1:26:23] minister send a prophet a seer thankful
[1:26:26] thank God for Paul because Paul is
[1:26:29] warning us what's coming. So he's
[1:26:31] recognizing in the age that the God has
[1:26:33] sent a prophet to warn us about the
[1:26:36] coming of the Lord and he puts at the
[1:26:38] right place.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; God bless brother Peter for that. Amen.
[1:26:42] So that a good scripture someone doesn't
[1:26:44] understand why you believe in a prophet.
[1:26:48] So also in all his I read that part ye
[1:26:51] therefore beloved seeing you know these
[1:26:53] things before be aware lest ye also
[1:26:56] being led away with the errors of the
[1:26:58] wicked fall from your own steadfast
[1:27:01] fastness. Once again the word
[1:27:03] steadfastness
[1:27:05] but grow in grace and in the knowledge
[1:27:07] of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To
[1:27:10] him be glory both now and forever. Amen.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; God called Abraham. He said, "I heard
[1:27:18] the word of God when I was 75 years old
[1:27:21] told me something that was absolutely
[1:27:23] against all reasons. I would have it
[1:27:27] would have been a super times, super
[1:27:29] miracles, but I was going to have a wife
[1:27:32] 65 years old to produce a son to me when
[1:27:35] she was 65 years old." When went down,
[1:27:37] let's go on. So there was Mr.
[1:27:39] Unbeliever, Mr. Scoffer, Mr. Skeptic,
[1:27:42] all them standing around. They scoffed
[1:27:44] and laughed at me, called me father of
[1:27:46] nations. When I had no children, I kept
[1:27:49] believing every moment, every month, it
[1:27:52] will happen. She got older and older all
[1:27:55] the time. But in 25 years later, God
[1:27:57] kept his word true. It happened.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; It happened. Amen.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:06] Sometimes we have forced the
[1:28:07] interpretation of the word of God and
[1:28:10] that's where we made our mistakes.
[1:28:13] God interpret his own word by making it
[1:28:17] to fulfill.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; We have put our time. How many remembers
[1:28:21] Hillary Clinton?
[1:28:24] We put our time. We put we put there so
[1:28:27] that this is the time. This is it. This
[1:28:29] is the one. This is this. We put that,
[1:28:31] we interpreted our own word and then we
[1:28:33] put it and then
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; we made a mistake.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; We put a time.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Just relax.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Praise God. It's going to happen
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; at his own time.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Don't interpret the word of God by
[1:28:47] yourself. The word of God will interpret
[1:28:50] itself by making itself to be
[1:28:52] manifested.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; You are struggling with something, don't
[1:28:57] try to interpret it. Just leave it to
[1:28:59] God. God will make it to come to pass in
[1:29:01] his own time.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; But in the meantime, keep praising him.
[1:29:05] Keep testifying about him. Keep
[1:29:07] witnessing. Keep saying, "God has healed
[1:29:09] me." Do you see it? I don't see it. But
[1:29:11] God has healed me. CONFESS IT. BE
[1:29:13] POSITIVE. AMEN. THAT HOW YOU ARE YOU ARE
[1:29:16] WATERING THE PROMISE OF THE SEED OF GOD.
[1:29:18] IT WILL COME TO PASS in his own time.
[1:29:22] Any
[1:29:24] person can have a burst of faith but
[1:29:27] then after that they go back to the
[1:29:28] things they were doing because they did
[1:29:31] not get the result right away.
[1:29:35] Only thing you have to do when you you
[1:29:37] see something in the Bible the prophecy
[1:29:39] deity of Jesus Christ that just a little
[1:29:43] or even Jehovah Jar says God is in no
[1:29:47] hurry.
[1:29:48] We are the one gets in a hurry. Just
[1:29:52] give God just a little bit of time and
[1:29:54] you will see the old prophetic wheels
[1:29:57] cogs run right into the picture.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; It will develop just like the bringing
[1:30:02] up of a picture.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Say just give God time.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Just give him time.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Do you realize that? Do you recognize
[1:30:12] that time is our enemy?
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; When we put time, that's where the
[1:30:16] problem starts.
[1:30:21] Say Jo he that endureth to the end Jesus
[1:30:24] said the same shall be saved he that
[1:30:27] endure to the end so it's not the one
[1:30:29] who start the one start good start is
[1:30:31] already good
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; but if you stop along the way you you
[1:30:34] are not you are not fulfilled you are
[1:30:36] not fulfilling you know in the race
[1:30:39] those who are running oh all start good
[1:30:42] already all hoping everything but as
[1:30:45] they start running start running start
[1:30:47] Oh, one fall one fall along the way. No,
[1:30:51] no, no, no. That's too long. That's too
[1:30:53] long. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.
[1:30:55] Stop. Stop. At the end. Is those who
[1:30:58] stayed in the race that they're going to
[1:31:01] win. It's those not those who studied.
[1:31:03] It's those who came all the way to the
[1:31:05] end. Those who endure to the very end,
[1:31:07] that's the one who going to be saved. So
[1:31:09] he says just keep looking on. Keep
[1:31:11] moving slowly.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; GOD KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING. WE ARE THE
[1:31:16] ONLY one gets in a hurry, not him.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; He let the Hebrew children walk right in
[1:31:21] the fiery furnace before he even turned
[1:31:24] the page over to write a new article.
[1:31:27] Should God is not in a hurry? The angels
[1:31:29] were IN A HURRY. GOD, DON'T YOU SEE YOUR
[1:31:31] CHILDREN? THEY'RE GOING TO BE THEY WILL
[1:31:33] BE THEY'LL BE DEAD IN THE FURRY FURNACE.
[1:31:36] CAN'T YOU MOVE? God just Oh, I'm just
[1:31:40] TAKING MY TIME. DON'T YOU SEE THAT I'M
[1:31:42] DYING? DON'T H GOD is just taking his
[1:31:45] time. If I'm putting God is taking time
[1:31:47] but God has no time. God is just
[1:31:50] watching. BUT EVEN THE ANGELS THEY
[1:31:52] BECAME IMPATIENT. DON'T DON'T use
[1:31:56] maybe the Hebrew children they thought
[1:31:58] you know Shadrach you know I think once
[1:32:01] we get near the door we just see you
[1:32:03] know God will send the flood and it'll
[1:32:05] be good. But as they're moving on
[1:32:07] nothing is changing. Oh
[1:32:10] sh Meshach are you sure? Are are you
[1:32:12] still standing? If you read the statue
[1:32:14] of prophet man prophet is commenting.
[1:32:16] Are you sure? You hold. Oh, I'm sure
[1:32:19] whether I die or not God I I will not
[1:32:22] deny God's word.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; I will stay patient. I will stay
[1:32:25] perseverant. I'll keep continue.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; I beg the go. Are you sure? Oh yes, I'm
[1:32:30] sure. I continue walking whether I die
[1:32:33] or not. I keep pressing on. Praise be to
[1:32:35] God.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; It's 12:30.
[1:32:40] Oh, we are one hour.
[1:32:46] So all this time we have been eating one
[1:32:48] hour ahead of the normal time. So it's
[1:32:51] 11:30. Oh, thank God.
[1:32:55] So So are you sure Shadrach, Meshach,
[1:32:57] Abbeo? Oh yes, I'm sure. I'm sure. I
[1:33:00] keep pressing her. And then but all the
[1:33:02] other one were impatient. Angel were
[1:33:04] impatient. But God was knew at what time
[1:33:07] he's going to intervene. Praise be to
[1:33:09] God. AND HE DID INTERVENE AND RESCUE
[1:33:12] THEM. AS LONG AS THEY STAND WITH THE
[1:33:14] WORD OF GOD, GOD WAS IN CONTROL. AMEN.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; The Hebrew children stepped right into a
[1:33:19] fiery furnace. But there was one there
[1:33:21] like the the son of man. God is no
[1:33:23] hurry. You are the one gets in a hurry,
[1:33:25] not God. God's right on time. Oh,
[1:33:28] brother. He's right on time. Let the
[1:33:31] rockets fly, the atomic bombs, the
[1:33:33] hydrogen. God's right on time. The
[1:33:36] church is going home one of these days
[1:33:39] right on time.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; We are going in the RAPTURE RIGHT ON
[1:33:43] TIME. AMEN.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO THERE'S NO we are late and WE
[1:33:47] ARE THINGS. NO, GOD IS ON TIME ALL THE
[1:33:50] TIME. AMEN.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE to God.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Now listen to this exposition of seven
[1:33:55] churches. Revelation 3:10.
[1:33:58] Because I has kept the word of my
[1:34:00] patience. the word of my patience. I
[1:34:03] also will keep thee from the hour of
[1:34:05] temptation which shall come upon all the
[1:34:07] world to try them that dwelt upon the
[1:34:10] earth. What does he mean the word of my
[1:34:13] patience? Hebrews 6:13:15
[1:34:16] for whom God made promise to Abraham
[1:34:19] because he could swear by no greater he
[1:34:21] swear by himself saying surely blessing
[1:34:24] I will bless thee multiplying I will
[1:34:26] multiply thee. So after he had patiently
[1:34:29] endured, he obtained the promise. You
[1:34:32] see, the spirit is speaking about the
[1:34:34] word of God which is given to us to wait
[1:34:37] for the fulfillment of what God required
[1:34:40] patience even as it did in the case of
[1:34:43] Abraham. He endured as seeing him who is
[1:34:47] invisible. He was patient and then the
[1:34:50] word finally was fulfilled.
[1:34:53] This is the way God teaches his people
[1:34:56] patience.
[1:34:57] Why? If he fulfills his word in physical
[1:35:02] manifestation,
[1:35:03] now listen this. If he fulfills his word
[1:35:06] in physical manifestation, the very
[1:35:08] instant you prayed, you will never learn
[1:35:12] patience
[1:35:14] and you will become even more impatient
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; with life.
[1:35:22] So God does that on purpose.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; It's not a lack of your fa. No, you have
[1:35:27] faith, you believe, you accept. But God
[1:35:31] doesn't give it to right away because if
[1:35:33] he continue to give everything right
[1:35:35] away, you'll become even more impatient
[1:35:39] with life
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; because you will be expecting everything
[1:35:42] to happen right there right there, right
[1:35:45] there. And you can't grow because you
[1:35:47] become very impatient.
[1:35:51] Have you ever traveled with kids from
[1:35:52] here to Calgary and you promise them
[1:35:55] good things?
[1:35:58] Are we there yet?
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are
[1:36:02] we there yet? They don't learn now to
[1:36:04] become patient.
[1:36:06] So God trains you,
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; trains me
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; to learn to be patient.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; They that wait upon the Lord,
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; shall receive.
[1:36:20] Let me show you this truth even more
[1:36:23] fully set forth in Hebrews 11:17 prophet
[1:36:26] continues by faith Abraham when he was
[1:36:28] tried offered Isaac and he that
[1:36:31] receiveth the promises the word of God
[1:36:33] offered up his only begotten son that is
[1:36:35] Abraham was tried after he received the
[1:36:38] word of promise
[1:36:41] and that's the key
[1:36:46] God gives you a promise When God gives
[1:36:48] you a promise,
[1:36:50] that's when the trial of your faith
[1:36:53] starts.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; If you don't give, that's why I put the
[1:36:56] example of a child. If you don't give a
[1:36:59] child a promise,
[1:37:02] he's not expecting anything.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; He's going he's not going to bother you
[1:37:05] anything.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; But the moment you promise them, says,
[1:37:09] "Okay, I will give you, you know, I made
[1:37:12] a mistake one time. I'll give you a I
[1:37:15] will give you a phone when you're 12
[1:37:16] years old, not before.
[1:37:19] Oh la,
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't stop hearing it.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Daddy, when is my phone?
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Because I gave the promise, right?
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; But I even gave the time, but they don't
[1:37:30] look at the time.
[1:37:33] Sometimes as even we grow, it's the same
[1:37:35] thing for us.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Actually, we are struggling because God
[1:37:38] has given us a promise. Abraham the test
[1:37:42] started when God gave him a promise
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; said I will give you a child then where
[1:37:48] this problem started if Abraham was okay
[1:37:50] maybe that's my destiny I won't be a
[1:37:52] child and everything Abraham will be
[1:37:54] living a normal life and everything but
[1:37:56] once he HAS A PROMISE
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; THEN THE TRIAL of your patience start
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; now when you look into the bible of the
[1:38:04] god's b the bible and you see a promise
[1:38:07] THERE AND YOU GRAB that promise
[1:38:10] You also have to remember as you read
[1:38:12] that Bible, as you have that promise,
[1:38:15] the test of your patience are there
[1:38:17] because it's a promise. But don't put
[1:38:19] time to that promise. Don't say it has
[1:38:21] to happen now. No, just leave it.
[1:38:24] Believe and leave it to God.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Because that's where the test of the
[1:38:28] prophet is putting a concept here. So
[1:38:31] after he received the word of promise,
[1:38:33] Abraham was tried after he received the
[1:38:35] word of promise. Most think that as soon
[1:38:38] as we prayed in Jesus' name over the
[1:38:40] good promises of God that there could be
[1:38:43] no not a trial. They could there could
[1:38:45] not be a trial. But here it says that
[1:38:48] Abraham was tried after he received the
[1:38:51] promise. That is exactly correct
[1:38:53] according to the psalmist referring to
[1:38:55] Joseph in Psalm 105:19.
[1:38:59] Until the time that his word came, the
[1:39:03] word of the Lord tried him. Look at the
[1:39:06] life of Joseph. He was a simple simple
[1:39:09] little boy. His father loved him and
[1:39:11] everything. But when God gave him a
[1:39:14] promise to the dream that he had one day
[1:39:17] you'll see your siblings, you'll see the
[1:39:20] the
[1:39:22] Swed
[1:39:24] say the in English
[1:39:28] those will be bowing.
[1:39:30] So the wheat the wheats they'll be
[1:39:33] bowing they'll be bow they will be
[1:39:34] bowing to him as in the dream as he saw
[1:39:36] the stars. Amen. Just that word escaped
[1:39:38] me from my mind. But you see the stars
[1:39:40] they will be bowing to be bowing to the
[1:39:42] to another star. THEY RECOGNIZE EVEN
[1:39:45] EVEN WITHOUT interpretation the brothers
[1:39:47] recognized. H so we will be he think
[1:39:50] that we'll be subject to him.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; The father himself. So Joseph do you
[1:39:55] mean this?
[1:40:00] Do you mean I'll be subject to you? But
[1:40:03] he kept that. He didn't question being a
[1:40:05] prophet. He didn't question that. You
[1:40:07] just leave it NOT KNOW. BUT SINCE he was
[1:40:09] given that promise,
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; then the problem started.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; As brother explained so well for Jacob.
[1:40:17] After Jacob had received the blessings,
[1:40:19] after he received the promise, then the
[1:40:22] problem started.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; After God has given that promise to
[1:40:25] Joseph, then the problem started. Joseph
[1:40:28] was the type of perfection. Perfection.
[1:40:32] But the problem started when he started
[1:40:33] a problem. And then the brothers started
[1:40:35] hating him even more.
[1:40:38] They started hating him even more. They
[1:40:39] put him in the pit. They sold him. I'm
[1:40:42] sure as a human being, Joseph was
[1:40:44] thinking, "God, how is your promise
[1:40:46] going be to
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; I'm here in the pit. How how can they
[1:40:51] bow to me being in the pit here? How is
[1:40:53] your promise going to be fulfilled?"
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; The word of God is trying him now. The
[1:40:59] promise is trying you. Amen.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Yet our trials was not when we were in
[1:41:04] the world. We were living like everybody
[1:41:06] and everything and everything all this
[1:41:08] is the expression life happens. Oh, life
[1:41:11] happens. Huh? But once you become a
[1:41:13] Christian, YOU HAVE PROMISES OF GOD and
[1:41:16] no if you are a believer, you will be
[1:41:18] saved and your children will be saved
[1:41:20] AND THEN YOU YOU ARE HOLDING ON THAT
[1:41:22] PROMISE AND YOU DON'T SEE IT. YOU WHAT
[1:41:24] YOU WHAT YOU HAVE A PROMISE BUT YOU
[1:41:26] DON'T SEE IT HAPPENING. THEN THAT THAT
[1:41:28] STRUGGLE IS GOING OH LORD WHEN IS GOING
[1:41:30] TO HAPPEN IS IT TOMORROW AND TOMORROW
[1:41:32] YOU SEE SOMETIME THINGS get worse again
[1:41:35] and you TRY TO PUT TIME I WANT IT TO BE
[1:41:37] THIS THIS YEAR HE HAS TO BE THE here if
[1:41:39] it's not this year
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; and the devil comes on you see didn't
[1:41:43] happen this year you see then you oh god
[1:41:47] help me just to relax
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; let off the pressure just waiting upon
[1:41:52] you Lord LET ME STAND THE FACT THAT YOU
[1:41:55] ARE STANDING YOU ARE AN A CAMERA.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; LET ME STAND. CONTINUE TO STAND LORD
[1:42:00] UPON THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; Joseph when he saw a little bit of
[1:42:04] Portifa and being promoted maybe
[1:42:06] thought, "Oh, maybe with Portifa things
[1:42:09] will going to be go fine and everything
[1:42:11] is going to be well." Oh, praise be to
[1:42:13] God. And then the wife of Portify
[1:42:16] started with them and with him and he
[1:42:17] had to run and then they put him in in
[1:42:20] the jail again.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, really? Really, God?
[1:42:25] I thought that I thought I thought this
[1:42:27] was the moment that why Lord why maybe
[1:42:31] I'm just trying to amplify it why why
[1:42:37] but the way of God to perfection
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; he was working on his character
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; to get to somewhere
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; God is working on our characters
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; the new birth is the easiest place
[1:42:50] actually as a Christian life the new
[1:42:53] birth is wonderful Don't reject the new
[1:42:55] birth. And sometimes you are afraid of
[1:42:57] the new birth. Now I going to separate
[1:42:59] from my friends. I'm going no God I
[1:43:03] accept you. I accept the Lord Jesus
[1:43:05] Christ to follow. That's the easiest
[1:43:07] place. Amen.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; But maybe when it comes to the character
[1:43:10] building, that's where the problem
[1:43:12] because you have the promise and you
[1:43:14] don't see happening right now.
[1:43:23] And the prophet says
[1:43:27] God gives us exceeding great and
[1:43:28] precious promises. He has promises to
[1:43:31] fulfill them. He will. But from the time
[1:43:35] from the time from the time from the
[1:43:37] time we pray until the time we get the
[1:43:40] answer, we must learn to receive
[1:43:42] patience into our souls. For only in
[1:43:46] patience do we possess life.
[1:43:49] May God help us to learn this lesson
[1:43:51] even as we know the people of this age.
[1:43:54] He's talking the Philadelphiaian age.
[1:43:55] Learned patience. We read the story of
[1:43:58] the lives of those great Christians.
[1:44:00] What a contrast we see between their
[1:44:02] lives and ours. For they were so patient
[1:44:05] and quiet. And today we all we are all
[1:44:09] but overcome in over impatience and
[1:44:12] haste.
[1:44:15] Amen.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Because we want things quick.
[1:44:20] I'm going to touch something here. I
[1:44:22] already touched it, but just emphasize
[1:44:24] it. James 1
[1:44:26] 2:4 says, "My brethren, count it all joy
[1:44:29] when you fall into diverse temptations,
[1:44:32] knowing that from the trying of your
[1:44:34] faith workketh patience." That's right.
[1:44:37] But let patience have a work, a perfect
[1:44:41] work, that you may be perfect and
[1:44:44] entire, wanting nothing.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Let patience have a perfect work that
[1:44:51] you may be perfect and entire wanting
[1:44:55] nothing.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; To get to perfection, to get to the
[1:44:59] capstone, we need patience.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. But sometimes to get that
[1:45:03] patience, God has to make us pass
[1:45:06] through some trials
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; to learn to wait.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; So every time that you are praying for
[1:45:12] patience,
[1:45:14] you know what you are praying for.
[1:45:20] So God make me more patient. It's
[1:45:22] actually God give me something that will
[1:45:25] teach me to be more patient.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; But we still need to pray for that.
[1:45:29] Amen.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Job was declared the perfect by God
[1:45:33] himself. God declared Job as being
[1:45:35] perfect.
[1:45:39] God declared Job being perfect. Where
[1:45:42] did Satan try him the hardest? Yes. It
[1:45:45] was hard to lose everything in one day.
[1:45:48] If it was happening to us to me, oh it
[1:45:51] would be very hard. Very hard. I agree.
[1:45:54] It's very hard. Very very very hard. He
[1:45:57] he lost his his wealth, his whole lot,
[1:45:59] his children. He lost everything in one
[1:46:02] day. In one day, everything he was
[1:46:04] definitely down. Thank God for a man of
[1:46:07] of man OF GOD. THANK GOD FOR THE SEED OF
[1:46:09] GOD INSIDE of him. Like we still God God
[1:46:12] give us God take us. PRAISE BE TO GOD. I
[1:46:14] STILL WORSHIP THE LORD. MAY GOD GIVE US
[1:46:17] THAT ATTITUDE CONSTANTLY ALL THE TIME
[1:46:20] DESPITE THE SITUATIONS. PRAISE BE TO
[1:46:22] GOD.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. But I think you know one of the
[1:46:26] after chapter one chapter two but you
[1:46:28] know after Satan has done all that he
[1:46:31] came back to God but said do you see my
[1:46:34] servant Job you even I I even allowed
[1:46:37] you to do things I didn't want to do but
[1:46:40] because you just want to test it I
[1:46:41] allowed you to do that actually God
[1:46:43] provoked Satan
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; and then it happened and I say you see
[1:46:46] what I've done to Job but you know when
[1:46:48] Job came back and when Satan came back
[1:46:52] says oh no because you give him his good
[1:46:54] health.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; Let me put in perspective what we are
[1:46:59] studying. Oh, I I think I made a mistake
[1:47:03] there. I made things happen all of a
[1:47:06] sudden.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Now I will give him something that will
[1:47:10] kill him slowly
[1:47:12] slowly.
[1:47:14] I will work on the time element
[1:47:17] because that way then you'll see if he's
[1:47:20] going he's not going to to curse you
[1:47:25] then he starts he changes strategy now
[1:47:28] it went on his health it didn't kill him
[1:47:30] he didn't it didn't make him in
[1:47:31] conscience no made him conscience be
[1:47:34] aware to hear the critics of the friends
[1:47:37] to hear the things and see and how being
[1:47:40] rejected he's working on the time
[1:47:41] element
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; are you with He's working on the time
[1:47:44] element. That's why the Bible says, "Did
[1:47:47] you learn or have you seen the patience
[1:47:49] of Job?" Patience of Job
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; because it's working on the time. And as
[1:47:55] a perfect man, Satan knew where where he
[1:47:58] could try to do something that would
[1:48:00] make him will make him fall. IT'S THE
[1:48:02] TIME ELEMENT. TIME ELEMENT.
[1:48:06] And he came the friend distracting him,
[1:48:08] the friend talking against him and did a
[1:48:10] different things. Even the wife what
[1:48:13] what the device gave him to the wife
[1:48:14] gave Job why can't you just curse God
[1:48:18] and die
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; it means you make it quicker
[1:48:23] as you stay there longer it's it's
[1:48:25] painful
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; time element is killing me it's killing
[1:48:29] you make it FASTER MAKE YOU DIE QUICKLY
[1:48:33] AND THEN THEN THAT'S it
[1:48:36] says oh my dear wife you speak like a
[1:48:39] foolish man Amen.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; Fish woman because those are the one we
[1:48:45] fall into time element and we trying
[1:48:47] things to be quick but I will hold on to
[1:48:51] on God.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; God is more than faithful.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; God is constant. Amen.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Is that not the attitude that we should
[1:48:58] be having?
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; James 5.
[1:49:06] Take my brethren the prophet who have
[1:49:08] spoken in the name of the Lord for an
[1:49:09] example of suffering affliction of
[1:49:11] patience. Behold, we count them happy
[1:49:14] which endure. You have heard of the
[1:49:16] patience of Job and have seen the hand
[1:49:19] of the Lord and the Lord is peaceful and
[1:49:21] of tender mercy.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; The same God of Job is our God.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; You keep standing.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; God who was faithful to Job is faithful
[1:49:31] to us. Amen.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; James 5 the same 7 verse 7. Be patient,
[1:49:36] therefore, brethren, unto the coming of
[1:49:38] the Lord. Behold, the husband man waited
[1:49:40] for the precious fruit of the fruit, and
[1:49:42] have long patience for it, until he
[1:49:44] received the early and latter rain. Be
[1:49:47] also patient. Establish your heart, for
[1:49:50] the coming of the Lord drawth draweth
[1:49:53] nigh. Grudge not one against another,
[1:49:56] brethren, lest you be condemned. Behold,
[1:49:58] the judge standeth before the door. For
[1:50:01] I'm telling to you this morning, stand.
[1:50:04] Be patient.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Establish your heart. Don't be wavering
[1:50:07] from here and there. Just stay with the
[1:50:10] word of God.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; Listen to prophet saying. I'll be
[1:50:13] closing in 10 minutes. Says, I know your
[1:50:16] faith. Exposition of seven churches.
[1:50:19] Now, he does not say here that he did to
[1:50:21] the church of Ingamos, you hold my
[1:50:24] faith. He's not talking about his faith
[1:50:27] now, but he commended them for their
[1:50:29] faithfulness. As he does, he also
[1:50:31] mentions their patience. Now
[1:50:34] faithfulness and patience go together.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; In fact, patience is the outcome of
[1:50:40] faithfulness. For it says in James 1:3,
[1:50:43] "The trying of your faith workketh
[1:50:46] patience." There is absolute absolutely
[1:50:49] no other way in which to gain patience.
[1:50:52] It has to come by the trial of our
[1:50:55] faith.
[1:50:57] Wow, that's a strong statement.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; That's right. There's absolutely no
[1:51:00] other way in which to gain patience. It
[1:51:03] has to come by the trial of your faith.
[1:51:09] You know, sometimes I hate to wait,
[1:51:11] right? But God will give you someone who
[1:51:13] makes you wait
[1:51:18] just to train to to train you on your
[1:51:21] patience.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:24] So Romans 5:3, tribulation work of
[1:51:26] patience. How highly God regard this
[1:51:29] outworking of our patience is seen in
[1:51:31] James 1:4. But let patience have perfect
[1:51:34] work that you may be perfect and entire
[1:51:37] lacking nothing. God's will for us is
[1:51:40] perfection. And that perfection is
[1:51:42] patience. Waiting on God, waiting for
[1:51:45] God. This is the process of character
[1:51:48] development. The prophet speaking. This
[1:51:50] is the process of character development.
[1:51:53] How highly God has commanded the saints
[1:51:56] of the dark ages. Patient as lambs lay
[1:51:59] to the slaughter. Laughling, faithfully
[1:52:01] they served God. This is all they wanted
[1:52:03] out of life. Just serve the Lord. How
[1:52:06] great was their reward. Amen. Romans 5:3
[1:52:09] that we read says, "Not only so, but we
[1:52:11] glory in tribulation also knowing that
[1:52:14] tribulation work of patience and
[1:52:16] patience experience and experience
[1:52:18] hope." Amen. So every time the Lord give
[1:52:21] me more patience in other words God give
[1:52:24] me a little bit of something that will
[1:52:25] help me
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; to shape my patience and we should be
[1:52:31] time is you know that I'll take too much
[1:52:33] time but time has slipped on me um uh
[1:52:38] just want to read what the prophet says
[1:52:39] here says um we we we should have
[1:52:43] patience the second part we should have
[1:52:45] patience with one another too one time
[1:52:49] we get too much impatient with one
[1:52:51] another. We get so much impatient with
[1:52:54] one anothers. Sometimes we have even
[1:52:56] impatient with unbelievers. But when it
[1:52:59] comes to the believers ourselves are
[1:53:01] very impatient. We want things done. We
[1:53:04] want things now. So we think we got to
[1:53:06] be like Moses. We think we got to be
[1:53:08] like Moses. Moses had patience with the
[1:53:11] people. Look that what caused them not
[1:53:14] to go over. They're trying to do I've
[1:53:16] tried to get this message over to the
[1:53:18] tabernacle to see that each member of
[1:53:20] the tabernacle becomes this. It's hard
[1:53:22] to do. I've tried to have patience. This
[1:53:25] 33 years prophet speaking. Have
[1:53:27] patience. Women still bob the hair still
[1:53:29] just the same. But just but just have
[1:53:32] patience. Just have patience. Wait. Have
[1:53:35] to. If you ain't got it, don't try to
[1:53:37] build on this down here. Have patience.
[1:53:40] Someone need to remind me this if with
[1:53:43] the Lord ter because I'm sure I will
[1:53:45] forget this
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; because you preached and you don't see
[1:53:48] any change.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; It's like I want it to happen tomorrow.
[1:53:52] I after my message I thought no one will
[1:53:55] do that but I'm sure you will do it
[1:53:58] again and then I'll be
[1:54:03] May someone remind me about this. God
[1:54:06] give me patience.
[1:54:10] But one time when the rebellion the
[1:54:12] rebellion bunch of people had such
[1:54:14] impatience they caused Moses to do
[1:54:16] something was wrong. But yet when it
[1:54:18] come to the showdown God got sick of
[1:54:21] their action. He said separate yourself
[1:54:23] Moses. I'll kill the whole bunch of them
[1:54:25] and start a new. He throwed himself in
[1:54:27] the bridge and said God don't do it.
[1:54:30] What patience with the people that was
[1:54:34] rebelling against him. Oh, may God give
[1:54:37] us that patience.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; Parents, may God give us patience.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you see that my kid, I've told
[1:54:44] you, I told them, but you see like still
[1:54:46] they're not, oh God, maybe you're
[1:54:49] working on my patience. Help me to be
[1:54:52] patient. It's God doing at our own time.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Those who wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:54:58] their strength.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Waiting doesn't mean that you just you
[1:55:02] you're not doing anything. Waiting means
[1:55:04] it's an active action. God, I thank you,
[1:55:08] Lord. I praise you. I believe you. I'm
[1:55:10] waiting upon you. Waiting, not waiting
[1:55:13] with a sad face. No, you're waiting,
[1:55:15] rejoicing as if it has already been
[1:55:18] fulfilled that how you're waiting upon
[1:55:20] the Lord. Thank God. I praise you. I
[1:55:22] worship you. I keep the joy of
[1:55:24] salvation. I know it will happen, Lord.
[1:55:27] I don't see it. I don't I I don't see
[1:55:30] it. I don't see happening, but I keep
[1:55:32] praising you. I keep thanking you. I
[1:55:34] stay faithful to the word of God. I
[1:55:37] praise you. I glorify your name, Lord
[1:55:39] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; Once more, one last thought. The prophet
[1:55:43] says, "We have received the son of man.
[1:55:46] We have received the message. We have
[1:55:48] received the son of God. Now we have
[1:55:51] received the light. Let us learn to to
[1:55:55] lay down in the light
[1:55:58] until we ripen."
[1:56:00] Very often we are not patient enough to
[1:56:03] stay under the atmosphere of the word of
[1:56:05] God until we ripe. But may God help us
[1:56:08] to lay under the presence of the word of
[1:56:11] God to be patient to stay there. Stay
[1:56:14] there until God works in our life. Then
[1:56:17] we will see the result of God. Praise be
[1:56:19] to God. Musicians can come. Amen.
[1:56:33] Teach me Lord. Do it.
[1:56:37] [Music]
[1:56:51] Teach me Lord
[1:56:54] to wait
[1:56:58] down on
[1:57:00] my knees.
[1:57:04] You go
[1:57:06] down.
[1:57:08] You answer
[1:57:11] my please.
[1:57:14] Teach me not
[1:57:16] to rely
[1:57:19] on what
[1:57:21] I do.
[1:57:24] But to wait
[1:57:27] in prayer
[1:57:29] for an answer
[1:57:31] from you.
[1:57:34] They that wait
[1:57:36] upon the Lord
[1:57:39] shall renew
[1:57:42] their strength.
[1:57:44] Oh, they shall mount
[1:57:47] with me
[1:57:50] as he goes.
[1:57:54] Oh, they shall run and not be weary. Oh,
[1:57:59] they shall walk and not faint.
[1:58:04] Teach me Lord.
[1:58:07] Teach me Lord
[1:58:09] to win.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; Oh teach me Lord
[1:58:16] to win.
[1:58:19] My hearts
[1:58:21] are a flame.
[1:58:24] Let me humble
[1:58:26] my pride and then call on your name and
[1:58:33] keep my faith
[1:58:36] in you.
[1:58:38] My eyes
[1:58:41] on me and let me be on this earth.
[1:58:48] you want me to be. All they that wait
[1:58:55] upon the Lord, oh shall renew
[1:59:00] their strength. All they shall mountain
[1:59:05] with
[1:59:08] Lord.
[1:59:12] They shall run and not be weary.
[1:59:17] They shall walk and not faint. Oh, teach
[1:59:22] me Lord.
[1:59:24] Teach me Lord
[1:59:26] to wait.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; I like verse two. Teach me Lord to wait
[1:59:33] while hearts are a flame. Let me humble
[1:59:36] my pride. Let me call on your name. Keep
[1:59:39] my faith renewed. That's our prayer.
[1:59:42] Keep my faith renewed, Lord. My eyes on
[1:59:45] thee. Let my eyes stays on thee. The
[1:59:48] problem sometimes we we are not like I
[1:59:50] say we are not beings of time. When we
[1:59:53] look at the time that's where we fail.
[1:59:56] Let's keep our eyes stayed on the Lord
[1:59:58] Jesus Christ.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; God gave the promise to Peter. Peter
[2:00:01] walk on those water. Walk on those
[2:00:03] trials. Walk on those difficult things.
[2:00:05] God can't give you something more than
[2:00:07] what you can stand. He knows what you
[2:00:09] are standing. He knows you are a gold.
[2:00:11] He knows that you are a diamonds.
[2:00:13] Sometime pressure from the outside makes
[2:00:15] you just better better diamond better
[2:00:17] gold. But don't look to the external
[2:00:20] things.
[2:00:22] Peter start failing when he start
[2:00:23] looking to those waves. He was already
[2:00:26] walking. But when he start looking to
[2:00:28] the waves, look at the circumstances on
[2:00:30] the outside. Then he lost hope. He start
[2:00:33] putting timeline. Oh God, I'm I'm going
[2:00:35] to fail. I'm going to fail. So Peter,
[2:00:37] Peter, why do you look at that things?
[2:00:39] You are already walking on the water.
[2:00:40] The fact that you today are here, you're
[2:00:42] already standing. You're still an
[2:00:44] overcomer. Don't look to the outside.
[2:00:47] Keep focused on the word of God and keep
[2:00:49] walking.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; Then I wait upon the Lord
[2:00:56] shall renew
[2:00:58] their strength.
[2:01:01] There shall mount
[2:01:04] with wings.
[2:01:10] They shall run and not be weary.
[2:01:15] They shall walk and not faint.
[2:01:20] Teach me Lord.
[2:01:22] Teach me Lord
[2:01:25] to.
[2:01:27] Do you know that song in this time?
[2:01:34] [Music]
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; In his time.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; In his time.
[2:01:50] He makes all things beautiful
[2:01:57] in his son.
[2:02:01] [Music]
[2:02:03] Lord, please show me every day
[2:02:09] as you teach me your way
[2:02:15] that you do just what you say, but in
[2:02:22] your one more time, let's stand together
[2:02:25] and let's tell him, Lord,
[2:02:28] It is time.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, it is time.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; It is time.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; In God's time,
[2:02:39] he makes all things beautiful
[2:02:45] in his time.
[2:02:50] Lord, please show me every day
[2:02:56] as you teaching me your way
[2:03:02] that you do just what you say
[2:03:08] in your
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; Let's try verse two. Oh, in your time.
[2:03:17] Oh,
[2:03:19] in your time.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; In your time.
[2:03:25] You make all things beautiful.
[2:03:30] In your time,
[2:03:34] [Music]
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; Lord. My life to you. I bring
[2:03:42] each song I have to sing.
[2:03:47] give to you a lovely thing. But in your
[2:03:54] time,
[2:03:57] let each one just pray to the Lord and
[2:03:59] say, "Lord, Father, give me a heart that
[2:04:01] is patient, just looking to you,
[2:04:06] my eyes focusing on you. Father Lord
[2:04:09] forgive me where I've been impatient
[2:04:11] where I have put deadline timeline
[2:04:16] where maybe father I felt discouraged
[2:04:19] because it didn't happen on that time
[2:04:22] and felt like Lord I didn't trust you
[2:04:24] enough but you are in control of the
[2:04:26] situation but father now give me a heart
[2:04:30] that is patient patient with you patient
[2:04:34] with my brother patient with my sister
[2:04:38] father As you have been faith, you have
[2:04:39] been patient with me, Lord. God, I was
[2:04:43] in the world. I did not know you.
[2:04:46] But you were patient with me. You took
[2:04:48] your time, Father. Until one day you
[2:04:51] called me. Even in my Christian walk
[2:04:53] with you, you have been patient with me.
[2:04:56] I failed. I fell down. But Father, you
[2:05:00] have been patient just raising me up,
[2:05:03] making me stand again and continue to
[2:05:05] move on. Father Lord, help me to have
[2:05:08] the same attitude towards my brother,
[2:05:10] towards my sister, just to be patient
[2:05:13] with them, Lord. But help me to stay in
[2:05:16] the bridge to pray for them with a heart
[2:05:18] full of love. Help me to pray for my
[2:05:21] children, full of love, Father Lord,
[2:05:24] that knowing that Lord, you are in
[2:05:25] control of every situation. Help me to
[2:05:28] be oh God patient with my my my wife. Oh
[2:05:32] God just knowing that you are working
[2:05:34] the patient way in your time will see
[2:05:37] result Lord Jesus Christ. Father Lord
[2:05:39] for the sister I should be praying for
[2:05:41] her husband. God help me to be patient
[2:05:44] with my husband knowing that you are
[2:05:47] working in your time. Father Lord help
[2:05:49] me to pray. Help me to sustain. Help me
[2:05:52] to support to be longsuffering to have
[2:05:55] that longsuffering to have the love of
[2:05:57] God. Father, the faith of God that
[2:05:59] produced the patience. Lord, I cannot
[2:06:02] come perfect the way you want me to be
[2:06:04] perfect unless Lord I have that
[2:06:06] patience. Oh God, I have I've been
[2:06:09] influenced maybe by loud this year where
[2:06:12] we we want things to be happen so quick
[2:06:15] right now. The attitude of fast food
[2:06:18] just now now right now. But Lord, but
[2:06:21] sometimes to build a character, to
[2:06:24] develop our character. You are teaching
[2:06:25] us to be patient, to learn, to wait
[2:06:28] patiently. Father, oh God, give us that
[2:06:32] attitude just to wait upon you, to rely
[2:06:34] upon your grace in your own time that
[2:06:37] you are in control. Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:06:39] as we see the rapture with the time, the
[2:06:42] end coming, God, we don't want to
[2:06:43] postpone it for the future. But Lord,
[2:06:45] today we want to accept your word and to
[2:06:48] to leave a life of a of a patient, Lord,
[2:06:52] knowing that it can happen any time. We
[2:06:54] don't want to have that attitude of
[2:06:56] impatient man because the rapture didn't
[2:06:59] happen in 1977 or in 2000 or in 22 or
[2:07:04] 525.
[2:07:05] But Lord Jesus Christ, but we keep
[2:07:07] pressing on, being servant, being
[2:07:09] faithful in the small things and the big
[2:07:12] things. Father, at at our work, a place
[2:07:14] of duty, Lord, fulfilling your word,
[2:07:17] praising you, worshiping you,
[2:07:19] witnessing. Father, maybe Lord, we have
[2:07:21] been prayed for our sickness. Father, we
[2:07:23] see yesterday we are not healed and
[2:07:25] today we still feel the symptoms. But
[2:07:28] want to give, we don't want to give up.
[2:07:29] We keep pressing on. By your stripes,
[2:07:32] I'm already healed. I keep confessing
[2:07:34] the word of God. God is my healer. He
[2:07:36] health me all my diseases. Father, I
[2:07:39] don't want consider the time. Time is
[2:07:41] the worst enemy when it comes to divine
[2:07:43] healing. But I'll keep praising the
[2:07:45] Lord, confessing God words. God has
[2:07:48] already healed me. He's He's my healer.
[2:07:51] He's my comfort. He is my salvation.
[2:07:53] He's the rock of my salvation. The same
[2:07:56] way that he gave victory to Job, he'll
[2:07:58] give me victory. The end will be a
[2:08:00] victory, Father. No matter what the time
[2:08:02] it takes, I know you did it for Joseph.
[2:08:04] you will do for me. You will work with
[2:08:06] me because you are the same God. The
[2:08:08] same God. And Father, you never change.
[2:08:10] If I have this right attitude, positive
[2:08:12] attitude, Father, Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:08:15] watering the promise of God with my
[2:08:17] praise, with my thanksgivings, with my
[2:08:20] positive attitude. Oh God, you will make
[2:08:22] it to come to pass. We love you and
[2:08:25] appreciate you, Lord. In Jesus Christ we
[2:08:27] pray. Amen.

[2:18:04] Praise be to God.
[2:18:06] So, um, next week, did we put the
[2:18:09] announcement, brother, brother Andrew?
[2:18:11] So, next week we have brother Jean
[2:18:14] Manassi from Cloverdale. Um, he's going
[2:18:18] to be ministering for us and he came
[2:18:21] with brother. Last time he came but
[2:18:23] didn't come here, he went to end time.
[2:18:24] He he um but he's going to minister at a
[2:18:28] young it's a young minister but I
[2:18:30] appreciate him a lot and he u he he he
[2:18:35] expressed the desire to well to to to to
[2:18:40] show his support. Amen.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; So we thank God for that. So after that,
[2:18:44] so it'll be the last Sunday for me and
[2:18:47] um I'll try to be there um to be there
[2:18:50] on the service cuz it's my annual on
[2:18:52] call day, but I'll be there and um it'll
[2:18:55] be uh just another thing is so he has a
[2:18:58] friend there who was who's a good friend
[2:19:02] of me but he's a friend to brother Jean.
[2:19:05] He's a he's a song leader.
[2:19:08] So he requested not a song but he
[2:19:11] requested the song service.
[2:19:15] So he wanted to help with the songs the
[2:19:17] whole song service as an expression of
[2:19:20] uh of love and support to the church. I
[2:19:24] was a little bit surprised by that
[2:19:26] request and oh that first time I hear it
[2:19:30] and uh so I asked my wife and the wife
[2:19:32] said no actually they do that in South
[2:19:34] Africa and Zimbabwe.
[2:19:36] seems like a common thing for where they
[2:19:38] come from. The song leader can express
[2:19:41] the support to the church and and just
[2:19:43] take the whole service and as a as a
[2:19:46] minister take the ministry and then the
[2:19:47] song service can be taken by someone who
[2:19:50] has can lead the songs. Okay. It will be
[2:19:53] a first experience. I hope it's okay
[2:19:55] with you.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; And I I I asked permission to the song
[2:19:59] leaders first and they they didn't
[2:20:02] object. So I I I allow that and So it
[2:20:06] will be a new experience with someone
[2:20:07] else. But uh uh I hope it will be a
[2:20:10] blessing. Amen. And this evening I'll be
[2:20:13] at end time just to support um since
[2:20:15] brother Ed announced that I've never
[2:20:18] been to that church. So I'll be there
[2:20:20] again this evening there and just
[2:20:24] um until he announced that he was sick
[2:20:26] or something. So I've not been there to
[2:20:29] support them with my presence. So I'll
[2:20:31] be supporting the church there. not
[2:20:33] preaching but just to be there to show
[2:20:36] my support as well to church. Um
[2:20:39] [Music]
[2:20:45] let's sing two verses. I'm rejoicing
[2:20:48] every day despite what is happening.
