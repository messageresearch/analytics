[32:23] So
[32:26] to have the new birth you need faith.
[32:28] You have to believe. You have to start
[32:30] somewhere. You have to believe what the
[32:32] word of God. That's why you have to
[32:34] repent. That have you have to repent.
[32:36] Repentance is based upon the word of
[32:38] God. what the word of God says, then you
[32:40] repent, then you accept the word of God,
[32:43] then you give your heart to the Lord
[32:45] Jesus Christ, then you are being
[32:46] baptized in water because of the faith
[32:49] and confession of your faith upon the
[32:51] word of God. Amen. That's the first
[32:54] start. And you have to start with the
[32:55] word of God. You can't repent upon
[32:58] creed, upon theology, upon reasoning of
[33:00] a man. You have to start with the word
[33:03] of God. Amen. Faith comes by hearing and
[33:06] hearing of the word of God. Someone has
[33:08] to testify to you. Someone has to give
[33:10] you the book. That's why we keep
[33:12] printing the books in India. And because
[33:15] we believe in the power of the word of
[33:17] God, the word of God has to be prayed.
[33:19] The word of God has to be spread. The
[33:20] word of God has to be preached. The word
[33:22] of God has to be translated because that
[33:25] the way the means by which the word the
[33:28] faith can increase is only by the word
[33:30] of God. Amen. And then someone has to
[33:33] preach to you. Someone have preachers
[33:34] and I say how can they hear without
[33:36] preachers? Sometimes people remove the
[33:38] preacher. Amen. The preacher is
[33:40] important because that the way the
[33:42] channel can God can use to to to convey
[33:45] the word of God. Amen. Faith comes by
[33:48] hearing and hearing of the word of God.
[33:50] And the prophet says faith comes by
[33:52] hearing. Faith once delivered to the
[33:54] saints. Now you hear so many people say
[33:56] today, oh divine healing is against my
[33:58] faith. The baptism of the holy spirit is
[34:01] against my faith. Says there is only one
[34:03] faith. Amen. And that faith doesn't come
[34:06] by joining church. That faith comes by
[34:09] hearing and that of the word of God. And
[34:12] if we are too if if we are and and and
[34:15] if we are bid to earnestly contend for
[34:18] the faith that was once delivered unto
[34:20] the saints, that faith should not come
[34:22] out of a of a of a creed book, but
[34:24] should come out of God's Bible. For
[34:27] faith cannot rest upon the shifting
[34:30] sands of man theology. Amen. You know
[34:33] the you know sometimes we we we we we
[34:37] can read good books we can read
[34:39] philosophy books we can read we can read
[34:42] how do you say um u mind development
[34:45] books and they have very good advices I
[34:47] read them sometimes very good advices
[34:50] but at some point they stop there oh I
[34:52] can apply that and I apply sometimes
[34:54] works and sometimes doesn't work but it
[34:56] doesn't have it's not it's not it's not
[34:59] the the the solid ground because it's it
[35:02] has not been vindicated. But the word of
[35:04] God has been vindicated. The word of God
[35:07] is God himself. So it cannot change. It
[35:10] is the absolute what the word of God
[35:12] says. We cannot reason about it. Amen.
[35:15] Says that's not the faith cannot rest
[35:18] upon the shifting sands of man theology.
[35:21] But it can only rest upon the eternal
[35:23] rock of God's unchangeable word. That's
[35:27] the only place that faith can
[35:30] sufficiently rest. So your faith can
[35:32] only stand and and rest upon the word of
[35:36] God. And the word of That's why it's
[35:38] important to hear the word of God. That
[35:39] it's important to listen to the word of
[35:41] God. It's important to come to church.
[35:43] Amen. It's important to put the tapes.
[35:46] It's important because our faith has to
[35:48] grow. Our faith, the faith that started
[35:52] for repentance, that brought you to the
[35:54] new birth and then when you are born
[35:57] again, it's not the same. It it's the
[36:00] same faith but that faith has to
[36:02] increase. Amen. Do you know that brother
[36:05] Brandham even brother Banam's revelation
[36:08] was progressive
[36:11] the same revelation he had in 50 or 49
[36:14] it was the same base he understood the
[36:16] patterns in the name of Lord Jesus
[36:18] Christ but he had to increase upon that
[36:20] he has to develop upon that he has to
[36:22] grow upon that. And when he goes to the
[36:24] third pool, he now that faith was much
[36:27] bigger, much greater than how he
[36:30] started. Amen. But he not deny the
[36:33] beginning of the the beginning of where
[36:35] he got as a as the initial revelation.
[36:37] He did not deny it. But he had to feed
[36:40] and he had to grow. His revelation had
[36:42] to grow. The same thing for us. Amen.
[36:44] Don't stop at one. I've been born again
[36:47] and that's it. You know, I'm I stay
[36:49] home. I will never be lost and that's
[36:51] it. No. Amen. And you have been born
[36:53] again, but you need to feed that faith
[36:56] with more of the word of God. God, feed
[36:58] my soul with the word of God. Amen.
[37:02] Amen. And sometimes you can go through a
[37:05] crisis and sometimes you can wander. You
[37:07] can go through a crisis, you know, the
[37:10] crisis you go through that itre is
[37:13] helping you to to to to shape your
[37:16] faith. Amen. To exercise your faith, to
[37:19] help your faith to increase. Amen. You
[37:21] know sometimes you pray God give me give
[37:23] me more faith. God has different ways
[37:26] sometimes he has to increase our faith
[37:30] through the word of God but sometimes he
[37:31] comes and check if if that faith is
[37:34] solidly anchored because it has to be
[37:37] tested. God test only his own faith that
[37:40] he put inside of the believer.
[37:43] If you have a need, you feed the word of
[37:45] God to supply that need. Whatever need
[37:48] you have, we can be going through a
[37:50] crisis. Sometimes you go through a
[37:51] crisis. Sometimes you go through a
[37:52] through a through a trial, you know, to
[37:54] go through a trial. Sometimes in order
[37:57] to fight that trial, to be strong in
[37:59] that trial, you take the word of God
[38:01] that they have promises
[38:04] regarding the situation you are going
[38:06] through and I will tell you it will help
[38:08] you. It helps me a lot of times. You're
[38:10] going through a trials. Maybe you are
[38:12] sick. Let's put an example for for just
[38:14] for simplicity of example. put in a
[38:17] sickness and you take some some of the
[38:19] the the the the first pool the first
[38:22] pool of the message where brother Bam is
[38:24] talking about faith is talking about
[38:26] healing and it's increasing your faith
[38:29] in that area and you you realize oh I
[38:32] needed that I need to increase my faith
[38:34] on that area I need my faith to be
[38:36] increased in that area because it's like
[38:39] in the natural in your natural body our
[38:41] body is fighting many things sometimes
[38:44] we are we are not aware of it. But what
[38:47] what is it? How is it possible to defend
[38:49] itself because of the food that is
[38:51] eating? If you have a a a a balanced and
[38:54] and balanced food, the body is fighting
[38:57] for you. Amen. Without you realizing it,
[38:59] brother say at some point, you know,
[39:01] faith that you have faith, you are even
[39:04] unconscious that you have faith.
[39:07] He said faith is unconscious sometimes.
[39:09] You know it's not because you have a
[39:11] certain crisis then you start you start
[39:14] manufacturing a certain kind of faith.
[39:16] You can't manufacture faith. Amen. You
[39:19] have to feed upon the word of God and
[39:21] when the situation rises and then
[39:24] sometimes you are unaware and you say
[39:26] one word and where that word comes from.
[39:29] It's the same word you have been feeding
[39:31] on. Now it comes in that situation. It's
[39:34] giving you victory in that situation
[39:36] because you have been feeding upon the
[39:38] word of God. Amen.
[39:41] Amen. And sometimes you are where did
[39:44] that come from? Oh, it was inside of
[39:46] you, you were not aware of it. But
[39:48] because you have been feeding upon the
[39:50] word of God, now that faith becomes
[39:52] manifested. Amen. Amen.
[39:55] Amen.
[39:57] Amen.
[40:01] He says you God in his soul by himself
[40:04] he says
[40:06] listen I'm going to say something faith
[40:08] is unconscious you believe it I've
[40:10] learned that in the years of travel
[40:12] around the world and meeting the peoples
[40:13] of all different back walks faith is
[40:16] unconscious you got faith and don't even
[40:18] know it right Jesus Christ no matter if
[40:21] he was in a storm and a gale is knocking
[40:24] the boat from one side to the other and
[40:26] he or he was standing in a face a mess
[40:28] of demons
[40:30] If he was hanging anywhere, he never
[40:32] moved him. In the message you saw by
[40:35] himself says he walked right on just as
[40:37] calm and quiet as he could be. Why? He
[40:40] was simply unconscious of fear of
[40:44] anything around him. Says that right?
[40:46] Whatever it was going to happen orever
[40:48] it was not going to happen, he know it
[40:51] was going to happen because God said so.
[40:54] He didn't say, "Oh, I have pray. Have I
[40:56] prayed through? Wonder if I fasted long
[40:59] enough. Wonder if I did this. He just
[41:02] walked right on unconscious.
[41:04] That's right. He believed what God has
[41:07] said was true. The words must be
[41:09] fulfilled. And he know that what his
[41:11] life was to fulfill them. What? Right.
[41:14] That's right. Amen. And you are here to
[41:17] fulfill it too. Just walk on conscience
[41:20] of fear. You and I, we are here to
[41:23] fulfill God's words too. So just walk
[41:26] unconscious of fear. Sometimes we take
[41:29] care and consider fear but we should not
[41:32] consider fear. We should not consider
[41:34] the the worst situation. We should just
[41:36] walk unconscious of all bad things and
[41:39] just believe what God says and what you
[41:41] believe that God has promised you. Amen.
[41:44] Says walk unconscious of criticism. Walk
[41:47] unconscience unto the world. Walk as you
[41:50] walk in Christ. Walk with him. Not
[41:52] paying any attention the right or the
[41:54] left hand. Just keep moving on. If
[41:57] something comes up in the church, walk
[41:59] with God. He says, hallelujah. If
[42:02] sickness strikes you, walk with God. If
[42:06] the neighbor don't don't like you, walk
[42:08] with God. Just keep on walking with God.
[42:13] And the walk of a believer is a walk by
[42:16] faith. Amen. Not walk by feelings, not
[42:19] walk by emotions. He didn't say did you
[42:22] how do you feel it? Did you understand
[42:24] it? But do you believe it? Amen. Walk by
[42:27] faith. Believe what God has told you.
[42:30] Amen. Amen. And then at one place
[42:32] another message says faith comes by
[42:35] experience. Amen. That's right.
[42:40] For me it kind of blew my mind because
[42:42] because sometimes you look at the
[42:43] experience we say oh but you know
[42:45] experience is not is not is not uh you
[42:48] know we should not base our doctrines
[42:50] upon experiences you know
[42:53] doctrine has to be based upon the word
[42:55] of God. Yeah that's true doctrine is
[42:57] based upon why would a prophet says
[42:59] faith faith comes by experience. I was
[43:02] just wondering upon that. I hope I'm I'm
[43:04] I'm I'm prickling you a little bit here
[43:06] to think about it. How come faith comes
[43:09] by experience?
[43:11] But the prophet says, "Yeah, it comes by
[43:13] experience." Because you because if you
[43:17] look in the Bible, sometimes faith comes
[43:19] by experience. It's those who had those
[43:23] who had an experience with God that they
[43:25] can face greater challenges. That's
[43:28] right. Believing in God's word, no
[43:30] matter what the challenge was. Amen. If
[43:32] you don't have any challenge,
[43:37] if you don't have any challenge, you
[43:38] might have you might not have enough
[43:40] strong faith. It might sound a little
[43:43] like negative, but it's not negative.
[43:45] God is making us go through challenges
[43:48] in order to increase our faith. Because
[43:51] you go through a small challenge. He
[43:53] cannot give you a trial way bigger than
[43:56] what your faith can stand. What bigger
[43:58] than what your what what your experience
[44:00] cannot stand. No, he cannot give that.
[44:02] He's giving you the trial. He's giving
[44:04] me a trial in order to help me to go to
[44:07] the next step. In order to go to the
[44:09] next step. So the more I experience that
[44:12] and I have to exercise it, the more I
[44:14] exercise it in my life and the more I
[44:16] exercise the faith in my life, God will
[44:19] help me to go to the next stage. Amen.
[44:21] Amen. So faith is not a one-time
[44:23] experience. Faith is something that has
[44:26] to be increased every time in our walk.
[44:29] God increase my faith. increase my faith
[44:32] to the point where I come to that faith
[44:34] that is mixed to the love of God. Amen.
[44:37] Amen. Perfect faith. We come to that one
[44:39] maybe another time
[44:41] to see what is perfect faith God wants
[44:44] in our life. Amen. Praise God. Prophet
[44:47] says you can have an intellectual faith
[44:50] by hearing the word and perceive it and
[44:53] perceiving it in your mind and accept it
[44:55] upon those basis which is intellectual
[44:58] faith in the second coming. So by the
[45:00] faith that Jesus was speaking of on in
[45:03] St. John 5:24, he that heareth my word
[45:06] and believeth him that sent me has
[45:08] everlasting everlasting life. That does
[45:11] not come from intellectual faith. That
[45:13] comes from born again experience. Amen.
[45:18] As a man thinkketh in his heart is born
[45:20] again. Is born again and from there
[45:23] comes forth his thought, his soul. So
[45:26] not from his mind but from his soul. He
[45:28] says then down there he says not what
[45:30] the mind says what the doctor says what
[45:32] your pastor says you know it anyhow it's
[45:35] in your soul when that soul is truly
[45:39] born again you have Zoe God's life
[45:42] himself in the man that's the gospel to
[45:45] my thinking so the born again experience
[45:50] gives the real faith and that faith is
[45:53] not intellectual faith is not even just
[45:56] your minds oh it makes sense No, the
[45:58] bornag again experienced faith is the
[46:01] one that is the real faith that God says
[46:04] that faith that I gave to the saints
[46:07] that was once delivered that's the same
[46:09] experience I want each believer to have
[46:12] and to have that faith that comes from
[46:15] the new birth. Amen. Amen. Do you see
[46:18] it? Amen. So you need the faith to have
[46:21] the new birth. But the real new birth
[46:24] has to give the real faith. Amen. Amen.
[46:28] Oh, the message is so good.
[46:31] Amen. Why? Because you were born to be a
[46:34] god. A man was made to be a god. We know
[46:38] that. Genesis 1:26. And now when he
[46:41] receives God, he becomes a son of God.
[46:44] Again, it says he was made in the image
[46:47] of God. God has hands, God has feet, and
[46:50] so therefore a man was born was made
[46:52] like him. So he is an amateur god. And
[46:55] sin has blinded every fiber in his body,
[46:58] in his mind and in his heart. So sin is
[47:02] unbelief. It has blinded every fiber in
[47:05] the in the body, in the mind and in his
[47:07] heart. But when you are born again and
[47:10] then you receive the faith of God. The
[47:12] faith of God comes to unlock those
[47:16] channels that have been blinded so that
[47:18] you can see like God. You can think like
[47:21] God. You can see like God sees. Amen.
[47:24] You can see the invisible that people
[47:26] can't see. Like that experience that I
[47:28] like about that that the brother that
[47:30] that father who's the prophet came and
[47:32] prayed for the son who was dying and the
[47:34] the the the the the nurse was there
[47:37] looking at that machine but that your
[47:38] son is dying. How can you be rejoicing
[47:40] when your son is dying? The father says
[47:43] you are looking at that machine there.
[47:45] It's visible to you that what you have
[47:47] been trained to look at but I'm looking
[47:49] at a different thing. I'm looking at
[47:52] God's promise and I know that my son
[47:54] will be raised because the prophet
[47:56] prayed for him and he laid his hands
[47:58] upon him. According to the Bible, it
[48:00] says if you lay hands upon the sick,
[48:02] they shall recover. The father was
[48:05] looking at the different things because
[48:07] that channel that was blinded now has
[48:09] been open. By faith, he could see what
[48:12] God sees. Amen.
[48:15] Oh, we need faith to see what God sees.
[48:18] Amen.
[48:21] The prophet says you know God by simple
[48:24] childlike faith so to accept his word.
[48:27] You say it's the truth and you believe
[48:29] it. That how you know God is by faith
[48:32] not by reason. Your reason power within
[48:35] yourself. By faith comes from God. Faith
[48:38] is something that's born in you.
[48:40] Something that God gives you. It's the
[48:43] substance of things hoped for and the
[48:46] evidence of things not risen. You cannot
[48:50] manufacture faith.
[48:52] God gives you faith. Amen.
[48:56] The same God who gives you the new birth
[48:59] because the new birth is a personal
[49:01] revelation of God. A a personal
[49:03] revelation personally to you. Amen. It's
[49:06] the faith God has given you. You cannot
[49:09] be born again by yourself. Only God can
[49:13] give you the new birth because you're a
[49:14] son, a daughter of God. Amen. Are you
[49:17] with me this evening? So if you are born
[49:19] again, that's what I want to put in. If
[49:21] you are born again this evening, if you
[49:23] are born again, let me tell you, you
[49:26] have faith inside of you. You might not
[49:28] be a conscience about it, but
[49:32] you have faith upon. You have faith
[49:34] inside of you already,
[49:37] you know.
[49:38] And that that's what I was thinking
[49:40] about is sometimes when you preach about
[49:42] faith and we feel like oh I have to
[49:45] measure myself upon no and you start
[49:49] like trying to fabricate faith upon
[49:52] situations. No it's not that don't don't
[49:55] struggle to create that faith. No the
[49:59] fact that you are born again you have
[50:01] that faith inside of you. It's there.
[50:04] God has you cannot create that faith
[50:06] yourself. God has given you that faith
[50:08] already. But that faith has to increase
[50:12] as you are feeding upon the word of God.
[50:16] Amen. So our desire is Lord I want just
[50:18] to yield myself to you so that you
[50:20] increase that faith more more inside of
[50:23] me. Let me let let me feed upon the word
[50:26] of God that let the word go through my
[50:30] mind and go inside of my soul to feed
[50:33] that faith that you have already given
[50:35] me. Amen. Amen.
[50:37] Amen.
[50:39] I'm going to give you one or one quote
[50:41] that little bit seems like it is
[50:43] contradict everything but just shows
[50:49] it says fundamental foundation of faith
[50:51] says I've said faith does not come by
[50:53] fasting
[50:57] faith does not come by praying
[51:00] faith does not come by reading a book
[51:03] say any book all that's good fasting
[51:06] praying reading a book. But faith comes
[51:09] by a settle settled something that in
[51:13] the human heart that tells you just as
[51:16] sure as you come to this church tonight.
[51:19] When you come home, you told your wife,
[51:22] I'll be home after the service was over.
[51:24] You do that unconsciously.
[51:27] You just go out and get in your car and
[51:30] go on home. Now, you could not do it
[51:33] unless you have faith you could do it.
[51:36] So faith comes by hearing and hearing by
[51:40] the word of God.
[51:43] That hearing by the word of God is
[51:45] sometimes is more than just the natural
[51:47] hearing. Because everybody can hear the
[51:50] word of God, but they don't have the
[51:53] faith that you have. Amen. But when you
[51:55] hear with a natural ear and then you
[51:58] hear by the word of God, there is
[52:00] something that God put inside of you
[52:03] that can say amen to the word of God. So
[52:06] the word of God that God put inside of
[52:08] the seed of God put inside of you, that
[52:11] seed of God inside of you is saying amen
[52:14] to the word of God. So the more that
[52:16] seed says amen to the word of God, it's
[52:19] feeding from itself to grow. Amen. So
[52:24] Lord, help me that I don't hinder that
[52:27] that that word of God, that part of the
[52:29] word of God inside of me to say amen to
[52:32] your word. Whether the five senses of
[52:34] the flesh understand it, the five senses
[52:36] of the mind understand, whether it
[52:38] understand or not, let the inner part of
[52:41] your word says amen to your own word. I
[52:44] hope I'm not complicating it at all. I
[52:46] hope I'm not complicating it because my
[52:49] desire is to is to tell to the born
[52:51] again Christians, you have faith. May
[52:54] God help us to exercise that faith.
[52:57] Amen.
[53:03] Look at Peter. Peter had the revelation
[53:06] of the of who Jesus Christ was.
[53:09] That faith helped him in many situation.
[53:12] He failed. He made many mistakes before
[53:14] he was even born again. But he had a
[53:16] little of faith. He had a revelation
[53:18] that was keeping him all the way knowing
[53:21] that I know he's a son of man. I know
[53:24] he's a son of God. Where else could we
[53:26] go? Amen. As I believe the message
[53:29] sometimes you we do not understand
[53:30] everything but let me tell you there is
[53:33] no place we could go. You hear it and
[53:36] you might have problems in the church
[53:37] and different things but where else
[53:39] could we go? The only place we can have
[53:42] if we stay with the word of God. We can
[53:45] only stay with the word of God because
[53:47] we had a personal experience with God.
[53:50] That experience, no one can take that
[53:52] from you. No one can remove that from
[53:55] you. Even the devil cannot take that
[53:57] from you. Even yourself cannot take that
[54:00] from you. Even if you want to go away
[54:02] from the word of God, something will
[54:04] pull you back against the word of God.
[54:06] Like Peter, he had that inside of him.
[54:09] And God says because of that revelation,
[54:12] no flesh, no no flesh, no blood gave you
[54:15] that revelation. The father in heaven
[54:18] gave you that revelation. And every
[54:20] church that will have that same
[54:22] experience, I'm going to build my church
[54:25] upon that. I'm going to build my
[54:27] tabernacle upon that revelation. Amen.
[54:31] Amen. Amen. Amen. Now faith that you
[54:34] have
[54:36] the real faith of the Holy Ghost that
[54:39] God gave you. Prophet we call it it's
[54:41] the purchasing power that God gave you.
[54:45] God gave you that faith. It's a
[54:47] purchasing power of everything you have
[54:50] need of. As an example, if you need
[54:52] bread, God give you the money for that
[54:55] bread. If the prophet says, you should
[54:56] be rejoicing already with the purchasing
[54:59] power that God gave you. Even though you
[55:02] don't see the bread yet, you might go
[55:04] through trials. You might go through
[55:06] mountains. You might go through valleys
[55:08] in order to get to that bread. But as
[55:10] long as you have that purchasing power
[55:12] in your hand, you should be rejoicing
[55:14] already. Oh, I have the bread with me. I
[55:17] have the bread with me. God has given me
[55:20] healing. God has given me my children.
[55:22] God has given me whatever I've need of.
[55:24] God has given me a life of
[55:25] sanctification. How come can you say
[55:27] that? Because I have the purchasing
[55:29] power.
[55:36] Amen. Amen.
[55:39] Faith by experience. The prophet says,
[55:41] usually people who have faith is someone
[55:43] who has experienced faith.
[55:46] Now, when you accept Jesus as your
[55:48] personal savior, there's not a way in
[55:51] the world for you to ever be saved only
[55:54] by your faith. You had to accept it. You
[55:57] had to believe it. Notice you could get
[55:59] down to the altar and could cry all
[56:01] night long and you could beat upon the
[56:04] altar and scream until you could scream
[56:06] no more. Still you are not saved. You
[56:09] could feel real good and run all over
[56:11] the building and shouting and still not
[56:14] be saved. The devil can beat you around
[56:16] the stump on your feelings. If I had to
[56:20] go by my feelings, there will be many
[56:22] times I will be all out of condition.
[56:25] That's the prophet.
[56:27] If the prophet could go through those,
[56:29] how much more sometimes you go through?
[56:31] He was speaking with the angels. Amen.
[56:33] But I don't rest on my feelings. I rest
[56:36] upon the unconditional word of the
[56:39] living God who made the covenant with
[56:42] me. If I would believe it. Amen. It's
[56:44] not what I feel. It's what I believe.
[56:47] Jesus never said, "Did you feel it?" He
[56:49] said, "Did you believe it?" Faith
[56:52] happens. It's far beyond feeling. You
[56:54] could feel tonight leave you like you
[56:57] are saved and and run around and
[56:59] praising God and the next morning you
[57:01] wouldn't have any feeling about it at
[57:03] all. Then you say I'm lost again. But
[57:06] when faith takes a hold that Jesus
[57:09] Christ God's son died on yourstead and
[57:11] become you in your sin then in your sins
[57:15] and then in your sins might become him
[57:17] in his righteousness and accept him as
[57:20] your only propitiation for your sins.
[57:23] Then faith takes a hold and all devil
[57:26] out of hell can't move it. Faith
[57:29] endures. Faith locks something. It seals
[57:32] something. When you have the best
[57:35] experience of the new birth, let me tell
[57:37] you, your faith can lock there. God, you
[57:40] are the one who saved me there. You are
[57:43] the God who can give me victory over any
[57:45] other situation that will come.
[57:48] As David was in front of Goliath there,
[57:52] he knew the same God, the same God who
[57:56] delivered him him from the lion. The
[57:58] same God who delivered him from the bear
[58:00] is the same God who's going to deliver
[58:02] him from these unsecumised Philistines.
[58:05] How do you know David? Because I had
[58:08] already an experience with God. Amen.
[58:11] Saul was the tallest in the army, but he
[58:14] had no experience with God. He could not
[58:17] face the challenge of the hour because
[58:18] he had no experience with God before. He
[58:21] was thinking that everything was upon
[58:23] himself of his strength or because he
[58:25] was the highest statue. But David knew
[58:27] that he was not the one who delivered
[58:29] himself. It was God who delivered him.
[58:31] If God delivered you yesterday from the
[58:34] things of the world like like brother
[58:35] Andrew said, he delivered you from the
[58:37] things of the world. From where he took
[58:39] us from today, we can come with
[58:41] confidence. It was not me who saved
[58:43] myself there. But that experience that I
[58:46] had over there, I can use that
[58:48] experience today to face the challenges
[58:50] I'm going through because it's the same
[58:52] God of yesterday is the same God of
[58:55] today. Let my faith increase because of
[58:58] the experience that God already gave me.
[59:01] Amen. And build upon that. Amen. Amen.
[59:06] It's like someone who's who's living
[59:08] then they have to tell him, you know,
[59:10] you are still living.
[59:13] But you are breathing. You are alive.
[59:17] Let me tell you, you are alive this
[59:19] evening. You are son and daughter of a
[59:21] girl. Don't let the challenge of the
[59:23] world come to you and say, "Oh, try to
[59:25] make you think that are you really a
[59:26] Christian? Do you really have faith?"
[59:28] You have faith. But we need more faith.
[59:31] Amen.
[59:40] Amen. Amen.
[59:43] So the prophet says he was talking to a
[59:46] man that was full of fighting theology,
[59:48] Saul, but he never had put God to the
[59:50] test. That's the way it is today. It
[59:53] doesn't take education, doesn't take a
[59:55] lot of thinking. It takes a humble heart
[59:58] who's being dedicated to the power of
[1:00:00] the resurrection of Christ and filled
[1:00:03] with the Holy Ghost that knows what they
[1:00:06] are talking about. He said your servant
[1:00:08] will go and fight him and God will
[1:00:10] prophet didn't finish that God will
[1:00:11] deliver him. You need faith and
[1:00:14] experience in a resurrected Jesus Christ
[1:00:17] to set your soul a fire to call those
[1:00:20] things which are not as though they are.
[1:00:22] That's what the world needs tonight and
[1:00:24] that's what the church needs tonight.
[1:00:26] Not the world the church needs. I you
[1:00:28] can't blame the world prophet. You can't
[1:00:30] you you can come to the church that you
[1:00:32] but you can come you can you can you can
[1:00:35] the church that already had an
[1:00:37] experience of passing from death onto
[1:00:39] life. Saul find out that his
[1:00:41] ecclesiastical vest didn't fit a man of
[1:00:44] God. It just don't work. You don't need
[1:00:46] to work theology to know theology. You
[1:00:49] need a little neology to know God.
[1:00:53] That's what we are doing in prayer
[1:00:54] meeting. Lord, I need a little bit of
[1:00:56] neology to know you more. That's why I'm
[1:00:59] here to know that the same slingshot
[1:01:02] that delivered me yesterday, the same
[1:01:04] slingshot can deliver me today. What I
[1:01:07] need is the five the five stones. F A I
[1:01:12] T H. F. What I need is Jesus. Amen. G E
[1:01:16] S U S. in order to overcome in this
[1:01:19] challenge that is coming in front of me.
[1:01:21] Amen. Because I know the same slingshot
[1:01:24] that delivered me yesterday, it can
[1:01:26] deliver me today.
[1:01:29] That's my sermon of destiny. Faith comes
[1:01:32] also by experience. Lord, I want to go
[1:01:36] through that experience all I'm willing
[1:01:38] to go through experiences with you. Help
[1:01:41] me to exercise my faith through
[1:01:43] experiences because that how that faith
[1:01:46] is built up. Amen. You know, otherwise
[1:01:49] it will be repetition. Oh, no. I I want
[1:01:52] favor. You know the seven sons of SA
[1:01:55] they try to do that one time. We will
[1:01:57] come and deliver. We will come and
[1:01:59] deliver this person because we we see
[1:02:02] Paul doing that. We saw brother Vanam
[1:02:04] doing that. Now, now come out in the
[1:02:06] name of Jesus Christ that brother Vanam
[1:02:08] preached. The devil look at them.
[1:02:12] I know Jesus.
[1:02:14] I know Paul. In our case, I know brother
[1:02:17] Ban, but you you don't have any
[1:02:20] experience at all.
[1:02:23] And then the devil run after them. They
[1:02:25] the one run of but thank God we have an
[1:02:28] experience with God. So you can come and
[1:02:30] present the token to God. God, I'm
[1:02:32] coming because I have an experience with
[1:02:35] God. You can present the same token to
[1:02:37] the enemy. The enemy, I'm coming with
[1:02:39] the authority of the word of God. I have
[1:02:42] an experience with God and I cast you
[1:02:44] out. Amen. Amen. The prophet will use
[1:02:46] the example of Shamgar. That that is
[1:02:48] Shangar. He didn't know he was not a
[1:02:50] fighter. He was not a soldier. But he
[1:02:52] had an experience with God. He knew that
[1:02:55] he was an Israelite. He knew that he was
[1:02:57] circumcised. He knew that he had an
[1:02:59] experience of a circumcision that he
[1:03:01] could not revert back. And you and I, if
[1:03:04] you're spiritually circumcised, we can
[1:03:06] cast out the Philistines in our land.
[1:03:08] Amen. Whether we feel it or not. But I
[1:03:11] coming in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:03:14] because I have that faith inside of me.
[1:03:17] God help my faith. Amen.
[1:03:24] Amen. Hallelujah. Prophet says, you know
[1:03:27] what I what what I did? I got some
[1:03:30] sticks and little people per says I made
[1:03:33] he was talking about this the story of
[1:03:35] of that turtle. You know that turtle.
[1:03:38] That turtle was wondering.
[1:03:41] The prophet came and touched that
[1:03:43] turtle. He wanted that turtle to walk.
[1:03:45] That turtle didn't want to walk. When he
[1:03:48] touch it, then just goes in the hull.
[1:03:51] Huh? Goes back. Prophet says says, "Oh,
[1:03:55] that looks like some of the people want
[1:03:57] to touch some areas in the word of God.
[1:03:59] They just go. They don't want they want
[1:04:01] anything. They want to hear anything.
[1:04:03] No, he's talking about my private life.
[1:04:05] Just go there." So, what did I do? And I
[1:04:08] took a stick and I beat him. I beat him.
[1:04:10] Even went even further like that.
[1:04:13] Sometimes I you need to have faith. You
[1:04:15] need to have you need to have faith.
[1:04:17] There's God. Oh, no. No. Prophet says
[1:04:20] what? I I took him. I put in the water.
[1:04:24] Just saw some bubbles.
[1:04:27] I baptize you in the name of Jesus. You
[1:04:29] now a Christian. No. Prophet said it was
[1:04:32] just dry before. Now he's right after
[1:04:34] that.
[1:04:36] We don't want that. We don't want that.
[1:04:39] But the prophet says, "What did I do to
[1:04:42] make him work?" Then I took some sticks.
[1:04:45] I put a little bit of fire and I put him
[1:04:47] in the in the in in the behind there.
[1:04:50] Then he start
[1:04:52] what we need in our church. We need a
[1:04:55] baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost. Then
[1:04:58] people will start moving. Lord, I need
[1:05:00] that baptism move fire to burn anything
[1:05:03] that is not of yours. Then I will start
[1:05:05] moving. Then the church will start
[1:05:07] moving. Then our family will start move.
[1:05:10] Then our kids will start moving. Give us
[1:05:12] that fire that what we have need on that
[1:05:15] lady pray Lord give me that baptism of
[1:05:17] fire so I can walk with you and have a
[1:05:20] personal experience with you. Moses had
[1:05:24] that experience of fire. That's why he
[1:05:26] could go back in Egypt and conquer
[1:05:28] again. God, we need that baptism of fire
[1:05:31] in our lives. Grant it, Lord. Amen. May
[1:05:35] God bless you and that is our God.
[1:05:39] Musicians can come.
[1:05:42] So we go in prayer.
[1:06:04] [Music]
[1:06:10] If you have any requests that you would
[1:06:12] like to make public, just

[1:06:53] pill of fire.
[1:07:08] Just forgetting that pillow fire. That's
[1:07:10] right.
[1:07:18] What we need is the piller
[1:07:23] of fire
[1:07:27] burning
[1:07:29] in the heart of man.

[1:08:10] leading us back to God again.
[1:08:16] What we have is the beard of fire
[1:08:24] burning within the parts of
[1:08:31] leading us back to the Bible.
[1:08:38] Leading the church away from sin.
[1:08:45] Showing the resurrected
[1:08:48] savior.
[1:08:51] Showing
[1:08:53] self alive again.
[1:08:58] What we have is the
[1:09:02] fire
[1:09:05] leading us back to God again.
[1:09:11] [Music]
[1:09:13] Do you believe in the presence of the
[1:09:14] pillar of fire? The prophet is gone, but
[1:09:17] the pillar of fire is still here and is
[1:09:19] leading us all the way to the rapture,
[1:09:22] all the way to the millennium. He's
[1:09:24] still here and we just need that baptism
[1:09:26] of fire, that dynamic. Amen. That how
[1:09:29] many desire more of God this evening? We
[1:09:32] just go in prayer each person and just
[1:09:34] ask God for few minutes. Lord, I desire
[1:09:37] that baptism of fire and the refilling
[1:09:39] of the Holy Spirit, Lord. Amen.

[1:20:51] started, he will bring it to completion.
[1:20:54] that just grow and become more and more
[1:20:57] reality. Amen.
[1:21:00] When we all get to heaven, what a day
[1:21:04] that will be. And we'll be closing
[1:21:09] when we all
[1:21:16] get to heaven.

[1:21:25] When we all
[1:21:28] see Jesus,
[1:21:31] we'll sing and shout the victory.
[1:21:37] Oh, sing the wonderous love of Jesus.
[1:21:43] See his mercy
[1:21:46] and his grace
[1:21:49] in the manions bright and blessing.
[1:21:55] He prepare for us a place
[1:22:00] when we all
[1:22:03] get to heaven.
[1:22:06] What a day of rejoicing that will be
[1:22:12] when we all
[1:22:15] see Jesus.
[1:22:18] We'll sing and shout the victory.

[1:22:31] house will over spread the sky.

[1:27:09] done for him. Says, "This son, I'm going
[1:27:12] to I'm going to sacrifice." God is able
[1:27:14] to raise him up. Why? Because he gave me
[1:27:17] almost from from death. I was not able.
