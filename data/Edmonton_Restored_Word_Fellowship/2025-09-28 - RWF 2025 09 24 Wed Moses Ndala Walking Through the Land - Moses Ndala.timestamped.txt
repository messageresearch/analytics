[25:51] in the house of the Lord?
[25:53] &gt;&gt; Glory to his name. Good to have you this
[25:55] evening in a prayer meeting. We
[25:59] certainly enjoyed the services on
[26:01] Sunday.
[26:02] I personally enjoy them so so much.
[26:05] Amen. The just uh the I I think it it a
[26:11] mini revival for myself.
[26:14] Just so real to me. Those who couldn't
[26:17] attend for those services, I will
[26:19] encourage you to listen to them. For
[26:22] those who are married to listen to them
[26:24] and a couple again and it's just just
[26:26] wonderful, just good good services. I
[26:30] really enjoyed them tremendously and uh
[26:34] if you just have that right attitude I
[26:36] think it
[26:38] it it gives us a different perspective
[26:41] not just on the
[26:43] I'm taking it a little bit at a high
[26:45] level maybe not just yeah the couple
[26:48] families
[26:50] but also church but also uh also you
[26:53] know when when we were in Africa when we
[26:56] were growing up they used to say you You
[26:58] know a child in a village is not raised
[27:00] only by one family. A child in a village
[27:03] is raised by the whole village. So the
[27:06] same thing you know just not it's start
[27:09] of your family but put it and extend it
[27:11] to to others to the to just make it all
[27:16] family man. You know the younger mothers
[27:20] not the young mother the older mothers
[27:22] encourage the young one. the older
[27:25] brothers, encourage the the younger one.
[27:28] Just make it a big family. Amen. A
[27:30] church is a big family. I think that
[27:32] those principles we can apply it to each
[27:35] and every one of us. Just wonderful.
[27:37] Amen.
[27:39] &gt;&gt; Genesis 13. Then we go to the word of
[27:42] God.
[27:44] So turn to Genesis 13.
[27:48] Keep praying for sister Agnes like
[27:51] brother Andrew mentioned it. Um I didn't
[27:54] get any updates on that rather Shadrach
[27:57] communicated.
[27:58] Um
[28:03] but we keep them in prayer prayed with
[28:05] them on the phone
[28:07] as she was at the hospital there but
[28:11] and just continue praying for them. the
[28:14] trial the family is going through not
[28:17] only the family brother Shadrach but
[28:19] it's affecting the
[28:21] um sister Est sister
[28:25] Mameister Mameister
[28:28] u the older brother older sister of
[28:31] brother Shadrach
[28:33] so um and as the so the older nephew and
[28:38] all the others are just being affected
[28:40] so it's affecting the whole family just
[28:42] keep them prayer
[28:43] And naturally it affecting our church as
[28:46] well. So just keep them in prayer.
[28:49] Before we go to Genesis 13, let's just
[28:51] go bow our heads. Word of prayer.
[28:54] Father, we thank you to be again in the
[28:56] house the Lord this evening. Father in
[28:59] the evening time
[29:02] as it was in Genesis, Lord, as you could
[29:04] come in the evening time, have
[29:06] fellowship with Adam and Eve. Lord, we
[29:09] believe that as the word of God has been
[29:12] restored and that fellowship has been
[29:14] restored between the bride and you,
[29:17] Lord, we can have that fellowship in the
[29:20] evening time. Lord Jesus Christ, we

[29:29] Lord. We express our thanksgivings
[29:32] towards you for what you have done in
[29:34] our lives, what you continue to do,
[29:37] Lord. Father as we like to dedicate this
[29:41] moment a few moments Lord in your
[29:43] presence maybe one hour again remaining
[29:46] for the service father we just want to
[29:48] commit this one hour in your hands that
[29:52] you have the full preminence to hear the
[29:54] word but also father to speak to our
[29:57] heart but also when we speak that you
[29:59] will speak through our lips that you'll
[30:02] pray father through our heart that you

[30:07] can stand in big gap for others Lord for
[30:10] those who are here but also for those
[30:12] who could not make it for the great need
[30:15] Lord of Sister Agnes Lord as she's going
[30:17] through this trial Lord from almost
[30:20] nowhere nothing and now it's been
[30:23] declared the tumor Lord Lord may you
[30:26] intervene a special way God you heal by
[30:29] different ways but Lord you are the only
[30:32] healer
[30:33] &gt;&gt; may your father Lord touch her in a
[30:35] supernatural way as I thinking about it.
[30:38] Thought father lord of this third pool
[30:40] when the prophet could say before a
[30:42] doctor touch let it be removed father I
[30:45] believe that you are still the same god
[30:47] but whichever way you choose father that
[30:50] the same power of god will be working

[31:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; I have a problem with my songs. Brother
[31:56] Andre, is everything fine or did I
[31:59] all is good now or good?
[32:06] Um, I can hear myself. Can you hear me?
[32:09] Good. That's good. So, Genesis 13:14
[32:14] 17.
[32:20] That was not me.
[32:28] Can wake you up a little bit.
[32:33] Now there's
[32:50] Yeah, it's good. Yep.
[32:59] towards the end of my of the sermon. Do
[33:02] it again to wake people up.
[33:09] So, Genesis 13:14.
[33:12] Um,
[33:23] so the Bible says,
[33:26] "And the Lord said unto Abraham, after
[33:28] that Lot had was separated from him,
[33:32] lift up now thine eyes, and look from
[33:35] the place where thou heart, northward,
[33:38] and southward, and eastward, and
[33:40] westward, For all the land which thy
[33:44] seest to thee will I give it, and to thy
[33:48] seed forever. And I will make thy seed
[33:51] as the dust of the earth, so that if a
[33:53] man can number the dust of the earth,
[33:55] then shall thy seed also be numbered.
[33:58] Arise, walk through the land, in the
[34:00] length of it, and in the breadth of it,
[34:03] and I will give it unto thee." Then
[34:06] Abraham removed his tent and came and
[34:09] dwelt in the plain of memory which is in
[34:12] Abram and built there an altar unto the
[34:15] Lord. May God bless his word and
[34:18] inspiration give us the context of it.
[34:20] You can have a seat. Amen.
[34:26] The Bible as the Bible said unto Abraham
[34:29] after that Lot was separated from him.
[34:31] So this promise was given to Abraham
[34:34] only after there was a separation. I
[34:35] would like to talk a little bit for a
[34:37] few moment here before we go in prayer.
[34:39] I would like to talk about walking
[34:41] through the land. Ask Abraham arise and
[34:44] walk through the land in the length of
[34:46] it and in the breadth of it for I will
[34:49] give it unto thee. Walk into the
[34:52] promised land. Amen. Walk into promised
[34:55] land. Abraham was given a a physical
[34:57] land. Abraham was given a physical land.
[35:00] And that physical land, people are still
[35:02] fighting about it. And around it, Israel
[35:04] is still fighting for it until now.
[35:07] Although it has been a promise to God,
[35:09] promise to Abraham from God that I will
[35:12] give you this land to you and to thy
[35:14] seed. Amen. Even though he gave him that
[35:17] land, they are still fighting for that
[35:19] land. Amen. But it's a promise that it
[35:21] belongs to them. The true Jew, a true
[35:23] Jew knows that that land belongs to him.
[35:26] It's not something to compromise about
[35:28] it. So something where we cannot maybe
[35:31] sometimes make people understand you
[35:34] know I feel sometimes sorry and I I I
[35:36] sometime sometime feel sorry for the
[35:38] people you know the United Nations
[35:40] because because they can't comprehend it
[35:43] from them they're looking international
[35:44] laws. So how can you just declare from
[35:47] out of the blue that a god wrote
[35:50] somewhere to you and this land belongs
[35:51] to you. Yeah. You can't make it
[35:54] understand it according to the
[35:55] international laws. You can't make them
[35:57] reason. You can make them have argument
[35:59] to base on it because the what applies
[36:02] to Israel, what applies to that land is
[36:04] not something you can argue about it
[36:07] intellectually. It's just God has given
[36:10] to them and you have to accept it and
[36:12] belongs to them and it's their property.
[36:15] You can't argue about it.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; Can't say but if you do this and then it
[36:19] double you do this but what about
[36:22] Russia? What about Russia can take that
[36:24] land and declare that Ukraine belongs to
[36:26] them? No, it's not the same role. Israel
[36:29] belongs. That land belongs to Israel
[36:32] because God said so. Amen. And God is
[36:35] the absolute. Amen.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; And notice here that they say you have
[36:40] they have they he has a land. It was
[36:42] given to Abraham. But that blessing
[36:44] prophet say God blessed Abraham only
[36:47] after he was separated from Lot. Only
[36:50] after he was separated from his father
[36:52] when the father died. He he left the
[36:55] land where he was living and then but he
[36:57] took with him he took his father he took
[36:59] with him lot but they were not part of
[37:01] the promise but when they he was
[37:03] separated from them then God blessed him
[37:06] so in order for us to be blessed we have
[37:08] to be separated from unbelief we have to
[37:11] be separated from the domination of
[37:13] thought we have to be separated from the
[37:15] things of the past in order to be
[37:18] beneficiaries of God blessings amen
[37:21] that's just the role that's that part of
[37:23] the princip principle of the principles.
[37:25] Abraham received a physical land, we
[37:28] have a spiritual land. Amen. The same
[37:30] promise is given to us that we have a
[37:33] spiritual land and God has given us a
[37:35] spiritual land. The prophet will say in
[37:36] the invisible union of the bride of of
[37:39] Christ, it says Abraham was a pilgrim.
[37:41] The same for us, we are pilgrim. This
[37:43] world is not our world. We are going to
[37:45] a land. We're going to to to the final
[37:47] land. But before we go there, there is a
[37:49] land that God has promised us a
[37:51] spiritual land. God has separated us
[37:53] from all the dead religions. I'm
[37:55] speaking across the prophet says I'm
[37:57] speaking across the nation now all the
[37:59] dead creeds and to what he has separated
[38:01] us and open to us a new land a new
[38:06] message for this day and they will be
[38:08] thinking of that they say oh thank God
[38:10] you will be thank God this is
[38:12] thanksgiving message because we have a
[38:14] new land a new land the message that we
[38:16] have received is a new land the Holy
[38:19] Ghost is the promised land. Amen. That
[38:22] we have received. But remember that the
[38:24] one the promise given to Abraham, the
[38:26] promise was given to Abraham and Abraham
[38:29] Abraham made some some steps to get into
[38:31] the land. He had to leave the place. As
[38:32] I said at the beginning, he has to leave
[38:34] the place where he was and then he came
[38:36] into the land. But once he arrived in
[38:38] the land, it was just not it was not
[38:40] saying oh no. Now God did not tell him
[38:43] you know you're in the land and know
[38:44] just everything just uh just put your
[38:48] hands and now you know this land is
[38:49] yours. No. No. God told him, "No,
[38:51] Abraham, you have to walk in the land.
[38:54] You have to explore the land. You have
[38:56] to make sure you that you check every
[38:59] corner of the land. Oh, this one belongs
[39:01] to me. This one belongs to me." You have
[39:02] to go in the land and explore it. Amen.
[39:06] The same thing that we have received the
[39:07] message. We have to explore the message.
[39:11] We have to walk in the message. We have
[39:14] to explore the Holy Ghost. We have to
[39:17] walk in the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. unconditional covenant that the
[39:21] the prophet says I like that come out
[39:23] and look he's going to put a comment
[39:25] upon what we have read about Abraham
[39:27] says come out and look it look it over
[39:30] walk from the east to the west it's all
[39:33] yours you took your way with the Lord's
[39:36] despised few now you are heir to all of
[39:38] it he says amen all belongs to you now
[39:42] Abraham I give it to you unconditionally
[39:46] &gt;&gt; amen
[39:47] &gt;&gt; I don't you don't deserve it But I give
[39:49] it to you anyhow. And the prophet says,
[39:52] "Amen." Oh, I don't deserve this, but he
[39:56] give it to me anyhow.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; You don't deserve it. I don't deserve
[40:00] it. But God by his grace has given that
[40:03] to us anyhow. Amen.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; He has given us the word of God anyhow,
[40:08] unconditionally because he predestinated
[40:11] us before the foundation of the world
[40:13] because he loved us. What is God's love?
[40:16] God love is elective love because he
[40:19] thought of us and he has given us his
[40:21] promise. Now we need to walk in his
[40:24] promise. Amen.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; Says I don't deserve it but I give it to
[40:27] me anyhow. So I'm going to walk east.
[40:30] I'm going to walk north. I'm going to
[40:32] walk west. I'm going to walk south and
[40:35] see what I own in the kingdom of God.
[40:38] All things are mine. Amen.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Let's get up and walk around. See how it
[40:43] looks. My it feels good. Take God by
[40:46] faith. That's why we are here in a
[40:48] prayer. We want to walk in God's
[40:50] promise. Amen. Not limit ourself to one
[40:52] just one portion. No, we want to walk in
[40:55] the whole land. You need healing, walk
[40:57] on it. Amen. You need salvation, walk on
[41:00] it. You need redemption, walk on it. You
[41:03] you you need joy of salvation, walk on
[41:06] it. Amen. You need peace, walk on it.
[41:08] You need salvation for your children,
[41:10] walk on it. You need work or job, walk
[41:13] on it. Amen.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; Whatever you have need of your financial
[41:16] need, walk on it.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; How many times the prophet in the
[41:19] message will say, "Oh, you have maybe
[41:22] there is a financial need." Sometime we
[41:24] put financial need like on the side.
[41:25] Maybe you have financial need, walk in
[41:27] it. Amen. It's part of the promise.
[41:29] Amen.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; Doctor said I can't he can't get well.
[41:34] But God said I could. So I just taking
[41:37] that way and that's the way I believe
[41:39] it. Yes, sir. Well, no. Well, no. I I'm
[41:43] still sick as I was tonight. As I was
[41:45] tonight,
[41:47] it doesn't make any difference. Just
[41:50] makes me stronger. Believe be more of a
[41:53] miracle tomorrow night for me to get it.
[41:56] Prophet says, "Amen."
[41:58] &gt;&gt; That Abraham seed don't stagger at the
[42:01] promise of God. The doctor did all he
[42:04] could. That's all he could do. But God
[42:07] hasn't done all he can do. Any job that
[42:10] too big for God, I can't I can't I can't
[42:14] tackle it. So I just commit it to him
[42:16] and I go on.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; We desire to walk in God's land. Amen.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; As we heard on Sunday, the promise of
[42:25] God and only only we should not only put
[42:28] them in the mythical and put it in the
[42:30] abstract world. No, we had to bring them
[42:33] down to the level where we are. Lord, I
[42:35] want the promise of God to be to be
[42:37] applied in my life. I want that's God
[42:40] desire connections. God desire
[42:42] fellowship with the bride. We also need
[42:45] connections with God. Amen. And also
[42:48] connection with one another. We need
[42:50] fellowship with one another. God make
[42:53] that real. Amen.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; Let's walk on those promises as well.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Connection. I like that word the way he
[42:59] was explaining. We need connection.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; My wife start looking at me in my eyes
[43:05] now from now on. It is good.
[43:09] I'm teasing her.
[43:14] Are you okay?
[43:22] Okay.
[43:26] Now I lost my arrows because
[43:30] &gt;&gt; need a connection.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I need a connection.
[43:34] So it says the prophet says in faith
[43:36] that what the matter with Christians
[43:39] that what the matter with people you
[43:41] don't know what you own you know if
[43:44] somebody gives you the Bible this
[43:46] blessed Bible here is your possession
[43:48] everything that God promising here is
[43:50] yours it belongs to you but maybe you
[43:53] say well the Lord saved me praise the
[43:55] Lord I'm glad for that I don't know
[43:57] about this divine didn't finish the
[43:59] sentiment but divine healing I don't
[44:01] know about these things Why could you
[44:04] buy a house without looking through it?
[44:07] If I own anything, I want to look
[44:09] around. Says, you know, the Holy Ghost
[44:11] is like a great big arcade. It's like a
[44:15] great big storehouse. Don't just limit
[44:18] to one corner. Go in that storehouse. If
[44:20] they say everything belongs to you, oh,
[44:23] go in that storehouse, you go, "Oh, I
[44:25] look, oh, this is nice. Oh, I need it. I
[44:28] take it." Amen. Oh, this is nice. I take
[44:30] it. Oh, I need this. Oh, this is nice. I
[44:33] take it. Amen. Don't limit God. Amen. Go
[44:36] in that big stock arcade and take
[44:39] everything you have need of. That's why
[44:41] we are coming to the primary.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; We're not coming here to beg. We are
[44:46] coming here to take what God has already
[44:48] given us. Every redemptive blessing of
[44:51] God is already purchased. Amen.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; Even the resurrection is already
[44:56] purchased. Even the rapture is already
[44:58] purchased. Amen. Nothing is impossible.
[45:01] Everything is a it's a past tense. Amen.
[45:03] We have to live in it now. We have to
[45:06] walk in it. Walk in it by faith. Like
[45:09] Abraham walked by faith. Abraham, do you
[45:12] want to tell me that as you are living
[45:14] that small tent there, this whole land
[45:16] belongs to you? Yes. How come? Because
[45:19] God said so.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; But you are still sick. You still don't
[45:22] have a child. But I know this land
[45:25] belongs to me. Not only to me, but to my
[45:28] seed too. Even the seed that I don't
[45:30] know, that I don't have yet, but this
[45:33] land belongs to them.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Wow. The faith of Abraham.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; Prophet says, you know what an arcade is
[45:44] and you you are baptized into it. If if
[45:48] I own the arcade, I want to go on the
[45:51] shelf and see what I own. Look around,
[45:54] look at this. If something seems to be a
[45:57] little high or get me a ladder, climb up
[46:00] to it, look around and what belongs to
[46:03] me. What that ladder is Jacob's ladder.
[46:07] The prophet will clarify it and and
[46:09] qualify it at some another point. Say
[46:11] that ladder of Jacob is prayer. You
[46:14] think that something is very high. I I I
[46:17] can't reach that. I know it belongs to
[46:18] me, but I can't reach that. Then use
[46:21] Jacob's ladder. Because the the the
[46:25] lower you go, the higher you are going.
[46:27] The more you humble yourself, the more
[46:29] you higher you get to that place. Amen.
[46:32] The more you pray, the more you get that
[46:34] place where you think that very high. I
[46:36] can't access it. I I don't have enough
[46:38] faith to get there. Oh, stay in the word
[46:41] of God. Walk in the promises of God.
[46:44] Walk in the land. Amen. It's already
[46:46] yours. Walk in it. Amen. And go in
[46:48] prayer. And then you'll reach what is
[46:50] behind them. Praise be to God.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Says that's the way he ought to do as a
[46:59] Christian. Look through the Bible. See
[47:01] what the promise is. Every one of them
[47:03] is to the believer. Amen. Remember when
[47:06] we used to sing the songs before we back
[47:09] every promise in the book is mine. Every
[47:12] chapter, every verse, every line I'm
[47:15] trusting in his love divine. Every
[47:17] promise in the book is mine. That's
[47:19] right. Yes. It's yours. Amen.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Praise be to other God. So that's what
[47:25] we are here. We have to walk into the
[47:27] land,
[47:28] &gt;&gt; the promised land. Amen.
[47:37] The message says,
[47:40] "Then when we did, Abraham took the poor
[47:42] and barren land. And when God appeared
[47:44] to him, he said, Abraham, stand up. Look
[47:47] at the east. Look at the west. look
[47:49] north and south said every bit of it
[47:51] I'll give it to you. Now Abraham I want
[47:54] you to walk through it. Amen.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; You know Abraham what was given to him
[47:59] it was a poor and barren land.
[48:04] Israel was the one of the poorest and
[48:08] barest if the word exist most barren
[48:12] land a desert completely a desert that's
[48:16] why that's why Lot when he looked he
[48:18] looked Sodom and Gomorrah and look what
[48:21] Abraham is said no no you know what I'm
[48:24] going to go in the valley there cuz said
[48:27] Abraham has nothing here it's just a
[48:29] barren land there's nothing here I'm
[48:32] going to go over there.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Maybe in your situation where you are in
[48:38] you look God says just walk in the land
[48:41] walk the land of of the Holy Ghost.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; It might look like barren. There is
[48:46] nothing nothing productive. Nothing is
[48:48] working. But that way God ask you to
[48:50] walk in. I don't see I don't I don't see
[48:53] how I can be prosperous in the place
[48:55] where I am. You know I'm there. Yeah
[48:57] man, let's put it in our level maybe
[48:59] know small church and I think and
[49:02] sometimes struggling to have a a a
[49:05] pianist sometime here. Can we put our
[49:08] level a little bit you know here and
[49:10] then all the negative things
[49:14] &gt;&gt; just walk in that.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:18] I'm put a bit personal know sometimes
[49:19] you have we have sometimes the
[49:21] impression that
[49:25] I'm hesitating to say that
[49:28] okay since I'm meditating let me just
[49:30] put it aside but don't belittle yourself
[49:34] &gt;&gt; amen
[49:34] &gt;&gt; you know don't look at the negative
[49:36] things don't look at the how small we
[49:38] are
[49:39] you know no we are the great nation of
[49:42] God amen we are like Israel small in
[49:45] number but great with God amen
[49:48] Praise be to God. Glory to God that
[49:50] &gt;&gt; glory to God. You know sometimes big
[49:52] churches can have the imp
[49:56] you know big church can have that
[49:58] impression. You know just come to our
[50:00] church you know there's nothing to youh
[50:04] just close it and come to our church.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. Why?
[50:10] Okay. Because you're a small number.
[50:11] Huh? Okay.
[50:15] So your reasoning is because we are
[50:17] small number we can just close the
[50:18] church and then just come and move any
[50:20] church.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; This is a sovereign local church. Amen.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; If you are two or three God is here.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; So it is sovereign church. Sovereign
[50:32] church. He has a pastor. He has a
[50:34] deacon. He a song leader. It's a
[50:36] sovereign complete church. Amen.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; It's not a mini church. It's not a small
[50:41] church. No like nothing church. No, it's
[50:45] not a secondary church in the eyes of
[50:48] God. No, no, no. It's a full complete
[50:51] church. Amen.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; We need to have that in. This is a full
[50:58] complete church.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Sunday service is our Sunday service.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Cuz you know, close your Sunday service
[51:05] and just come. No, it is our Sunday
[51:08] service. Amen.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; That's a misconception people.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:14] I hesitate a bit to say that but it's
[51:16] kind of bothered me a little bit just
[51:18] because talking to people no just just
[51:20] close your church
[51:22] &gt;&gt; you know this is complete sovereign
[51:24] church
[51:28] &gt;&gt; that's right
[51:29] &gt;&gt; you know that one time I made the
[51:30] mistake I clos not I made the mistake
[51:32] but it was in my heart I made the
[51:33] mistake I still say I made a mistake but
[51:35] I closed the church on a Sunday morning
[51:37] and I had a friend that I given a an
[51:40] appointment to come to the church he
[51:42] missed with this the Sunday before and
[51:44] the Sunday where I closed the church
[51:46] Sunday that's the Sunday came
[51:48] &gt;&gt; oh my
[51:48] &gt;&gt; came my door there's no one and he
[51:50] texted me
[51:52] &gt;&gt; I was like oh no
[51:55] one soul is more than 10 worlds
[51:58] &gt;&gt; should have been a church
[52:00] &gt;&gt; that's
[52:04] why a lot were thinking ah no I will go
[52:07] there
[52:14] Israel, land of Israel was widely desan
[52:17] if this is but God gave them a promise.
[52:21] Ezekiel 36 said the desolate land shall
[52:24] be tilled whereas it lay desolate in the
[52:27] sight of all that passed by. Everybody
[52:30] that passed by is all just a desolate
[52:32] land. The the the British no this is
[52:35] there's nothing. Why are we even
[52:36] fighting in this Palestine? There's
[52:38] nothing here. Let's move on. There's
[52:40] nothing here. Why? Why? Why? We were
[52:42] getting killed. No, let's leave it. But
[52:45] the Jew, the real Jew knew that this
[52:47] promise is going to be fulfilled.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; So they shall say this land that was
[52:51] desolate is become like the garden of
[52:53] Eden.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; It's a promise. Ezekiel 36:34.
[52:58] But today is a reality.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; It's one of the most pro prosperous land
[53:04] Israel. They they call it a miracle. How
[53:07] can this desert now blossoming becomes
[53:10] the more effective and most most
[53:12] economically very rich country? They
[53:16] can't understand it. And technically
[53:19] they says he has more startup per capita
[53:21] than any almost any other country. It's
[53:25] a agricultural miracle from a desert
[53:28] from the place where they have they've
[53:30] increased in in a drip irrigation the
[53:33] salination agre techchnique they have
[53:36] water independence from a desert
[53:39] &gt;&gt; despite a dry climate they have water
[53:42] independence strong economy greening
[53:45] land
[53:47] &gt;&gt; wow
[53:48] &gt;&gt; amen
[53:49] &gt;&gt; why because God's promise
[53:52] &gt;&gt; it's a land of prosperity for the
[53:54] natural Israel.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; And the natural Israel cannot be blessed
[53:59] outside of that land. Amen.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; If God can bless Israel, the natural,
[54:05] how much more the spiritual Israel, the
[54:09] bride of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[54:11] &gt;&gt; if you stay in the land of the Holy
[54:14] Ghost, if you stay in the land of the
[54:16] message of the hour, God will bless you.
[54:19] Amen. God will provide you all your need
[54:22] from that wilderness you are walking in,
[54:24] God will make it to bloom. Amen. It's
[54:27] God's promise. Amen. Walk in that land.
[54:30] Amen. Even though you don't see it yet,
[54:33] God will make it blossom. Amen.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; You will put a little bit of work here,
[54:37] a little encourage you as we heard on
[54:40] Sunday, there is a little bit of
[54:41] practical things that you might do a
[54:43] little bit. Amen. That Israel in the
[54:45] natural, they do some practical things
[54:47] and God multiply it. Amen. They put a
[54:49] little bit of water irrigation here.
[54:51] Let's try this here. And then God
[54:53] multiplies, flourishes. The same thing
[54:55] in the spiritual. God has you know spend
[54:57] time with children, have altar, have a
[55:01] connection, have a lot a family altar.
[55:04] Small things you do, God multiplied.
[55:07] Amen.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Moses sent the spies.
[55:18] Moses sent the spies to do the same
[55:19] thing. He says, "Search the land." Says,
[55:22] "The Lord spoke unto Moses." Numbers 13,
[55:25] and saying, "Send thou men that they may
[55:27] search the land of Canaan, which I given
[55:30] unto the church, the children of Israel.
[55:32] For every tribe of their fathers shall
[55:34] send a man, everyone a ruler among
[55:36] them." The search actually didn't give
[55:41] up into the eyes of word and get up in
[55:43] the mountain. See the land what it is.
[55:45] And the people he didn't ask them to see
[55:47] if they will be able to possess it or
[55:50] not. He asked them to search the land to
[55:53] explore the land to look how extended it
[55:55] is what the promises. I told I told him
[55:58] they were see how it is. And indeed when
[56:00] they went there oh it is indeed a
[56:02] country a land where it flourishes where
[56:05] the milk is flowing and everything honey
[56:07] is all the promises of God. Amen. But
[56:10] then it says, you know, we saw also the
[56:12] giant. We didn't ask you to go and
[56:15] describe the giant. Yeah, you can
[56:17] describe the giant. But the promise
[56:19] don't let the the way you're describing
[56:21] it to reduce the faith of the people.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no. Yeah. God gives you
[56:26] a promise in the land of in the land of
[56:28] the Holy Ghost. You know that in the
[56:29] land of the Holy Ghost is not the
[56:30] millennium.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; No.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. the hand of the Holy Ghost
[56:34] or the promised land for us is not the
[56:36] millennium because in the promised land
[56:38] they still had to fight. They still had
[56:40] to fight. There were wars and different
[56:42] things. Brother Bam says in that land
[56:45] there were even frustration.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; You can be born again. You still have
[56:48] some frustration. Don't be discouraged.
[56:51] Don't say oh no I have giant in this
[56:52] land.
[56:54] Keep walking in it.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Keep claiming God's promises. Keep
[56:58] walking in it. It's still mine. It's
[57:00] still mine despite the giant. It's still
[57:03] mine despite the frustration. It's still
[57:06] mine despite the fighting. It's still
[57:08] mine. Actually, I will fight for every
[57:10] inch of this land. I will fight for it.
[57:13] I will claim each and every one of it.
[57:15] Amen. Because it's my promise.
[57:19] In Joshua, he says, "Now Joshua, now
[57:22] after the death of Moses, servant of the
[57:24] Lord, it came to pass that the Lord
[57:26] spoke unto Joshua the son of Nun. Moses
[57:29] minister, saying, Moses, my servant is
[57:31] dead. Now therefore, arise, go over this
[57:34] Jordan, thou and all thy people, unto
[57:36] the land which I I do give to them, and
[57:39] even to the children of Israel. Every
[57:41] place that the soul of your foot shall
[57:43] dread upon, that have I given unto you."
[57:47] And I say on as I said unto Moses. So
[57:51] the first thing first thing now you have
[57:54] to arise and go over Jordan. So there is
[57:57] an action you have to do. Arise and go
[57:59] onto Jordan.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Faith is action. Amen. Faith is not only
[58:04] abstract. Faith had to produce action.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; You believe and then you act. You
[58:09] believe then you speak. Amen. That what
[58:11] faith has to do. The second thing says
[58:14] every place that the soul of your foot
[58:16] shall tread.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; So you are in the land here. If you look
[58:20] at there the soul of your foot in go
[58:22] there that it belongs to you but it's
[58:25] not yours yet.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; You have to make an effort to go there
[58:29] and put the soul of your foot
[58:31] &gt;&gt; and then foot footprint it becomes your
[58:34] possession.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Footstep is your possession. Amen.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; That's what we are going to do. So you
[58:40] have to walk in the land. You walk in
[58:42] every promise of God. You say, "God,
[58:44] this promise belongs to me because I'm
[58:46] putting the soul of my foot there. I
[58:49] want my healing. The healing belongs to
[58:51] me. I want the salvation of my children.
[58:53] It belongs to me." Amen.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; I want a life of of dedication of
[58:57] prayer. It belongs to me.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be destroyed for so many
[59:01] things. I become destroyed by the news
[59:03] and the different things to take my
[59:05] time. Oh Lord, I'm struggling with time
[59:07] to give to you. But now I come to claim
[59:10] that it belongs to me. Lord, I want to
[59:12] serve you in a greater way. Father,
[59:17] &gt;&gt; put your foot upon that promise. Claim
[59:20] it and confess to God and Lord, I'm
[59:23] struggling with this, but I'm putting my
[59:25] foot upon it and I'm claiming it in the
[59:27] name of the Lord Jesus Christ because it
[59:29] belongs to me. Amen.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord?
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can call the musicians. That's
[59:36] the end of the service. Amen. I have my
[59:37] 30 minute that's all
[59:52] prophet says now I put you on the basis
[59:55] of Luther on the same basis of Luther
[59:58] because you see sin was not known then
[1:00:00] like it is now but when we got more
[1:00:03] knowledge when we got more knowledge now
[1:00:06] than we Then when the enemy comes in
[1:00:09] like a flood, the spirit of God raises a
[1:00:12] standard against it. Amen.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Now today we have got more knowledge,
[1:00:18] more understanding. So the rivers of
[1:00:20] unbelief is flowing in heart but God
[1:00:23] raises a standard against it. Amen.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; When the enemy will come, oh there will
[1:00:30] be some wars in that land.
[1:00:34] But God will raise the standard
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; against it. Praise be to God. Amen.

[1:21:06] upon
[1:21:25] here tonight
[1:21:27] to give glory to your wonderful name,
[1:21:31] the lovely name of Jesus.
[1:21:35] We praise you Lord for being so gracious
[1:21:37] to us
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; that you have given us this land freely
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Lord on the day of Pentecost it was
[1:21:45] poured out Lord and we can walk the
[1:21:48] breadth the length
[1:21:51] east, west, north, south
[1:21:54] and Lord search the scriptures for all
[1:21:56] the promises that are ours tonight. We
[1:21:59] want to thank you, Lord,
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; for every promise that you've given us
[1:22:04] in the book that is ours.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Lord, we can place our feet on the
[1:22:10] promise of God and we can claim it and
[1:22:13] we can possess it. Not only claim it,
[1:22:16] possess it
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; by faith. We receive it, Lord. Father,
[1:22:21] we receive it on behalf of our sister
[1:22:24] Agnes.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. I don't know how severe this
[1:22:28] surgery is, but Lord, it sounds so so
[1:22:32] serious, Lord, but there's nothing too
[1:22:35] big for you
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; and nothing too small for you, our
[1:22:39] sister with the cold. Our sister
[1:22:41] Christina with her cold, nothing too
[1:22:44] little. We come with everything, Lord
[1:22:47] God, and ask you for deliverance,
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; oh God. We all have weakness in in our
[1:22:52] bodies. You see my weaknesses.
[1:22:57] Lord, you see everything about every one
[1:22:59] of us.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; We all have needs like our brother said,
[1:23:03] whether it's financial needs or
[1:23:05] whatever. Lord,
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; we thank you for those that Lord Jesus,
[1:23:09] you have supplied wonderfully
[1:23:10] financially,
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; but those that aren't, Lord, I pray for
[1:23:15] the blessing of God to be upon every
[1:23:18] life. And may there be abundance, Lord
[1:23:21] Jesus, in their life. We thank you for
[1:23:24] the message tonight.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; It was wonderful. Lord,
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; we need Lord Jesus the word of God. We
[1:23:33] believe in the natural.
[1:23:35] We need to know how to behave ourself.
[1:23:38] And it's good teaching Lord to
[1:23:40] understand what we need to do in the
[1:23:43] natural.
[1:23:44] But Lord, you have been given us a new
[1:23:47] nature,
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; a new desire, Lord, that we don't desire
[1:23:51] the things of the world, but we desire
[1:23:54] the things of God. And so tonight, we
[1:23:57] ask you to increase our desire.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Increase in us, Lord, that desire to
[1:24:04] come to church, Lord. And we thank you
[1:24:07] for everyone that has come.
[1:24:10] Bless them, each one of them. and those
[1:24:12] that aren't here. May you bless them and
[1:24:15] may you put everyone and every one of us
[1:24:18] such a passion to please you, Lord.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Oh God, have mercy on us. Give our
[1:24:26] brother Moses encouragement.
[1:24:30] Lord, I believe that you have left this
[1:24:33] church open for a purpose
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; and you supplied a need for us and
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; you supplied a pastor for us
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; and we thank you for him.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; May he not be discouraged.
[1:24:47] I believe Lord there is a purpose for
[1:24:49] it. And Lord God I believe one of the
[1:24:52] purposes is Lord Jesus the word of God
[1:24:55] is going out all over the world.
[1:24:59] the great country of India. Oh God, with
[1:25:02] 1.2 or three billion people, Lord, being
[1:25:06] supplied with a message, we have
[1:25:08] reached, Father, over a million messages
[1:25:11] that are going around to different homes
[1:25:14] and people. There's a reason for us to
[1:25:17] be here, Lord. Amen. It's not joining
[1:25:20] another church. It's just, Lord, doing
[1:25:23] our work and putting our shoulder to the
[1:25:25] wheel right here where we are, Lord. We
[1:25:29] thank you tonight. May we just grow in
[1:25:31] the spirit,
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; not only in the natural, Lord Jesus, how
[1:25:35] to treat our wives. We should by now
[1:25:37] know how to do it. You've been so
[1:25:40] gracious to us. We were just going over
[1:25:42] it with my wife, Lord. And you've been
[1:25:46] so gracious to us, Lord.

[1:26:14] that we need to be
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; live a life that they look at us and
[1:26:19] say, "Yes, it's real. It's real."
[1:26:24] Oh God, have mercy on every one of us,
[1:26:27] young and old. Give us grace, Lord. Give
