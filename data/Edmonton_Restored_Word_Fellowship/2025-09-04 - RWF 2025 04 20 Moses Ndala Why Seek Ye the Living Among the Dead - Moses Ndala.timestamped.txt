[35:25] My rest
[35:27] is go
[35:29] while I sit
[35:31] at your feet,
[35:34] sweet spir.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; Let's sing it as a prayer this morning
[35:42] to him.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; Sweep over
[35:45] my soul, Lord.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; Sweep over. over my soul.
[35:52] Sweet spirit,
[35:55] sweep over my soul.
[36:01] My rest is complete.
[36:06] Why
[36:08] at your feet?
[36:11] Sweet spit,
[36:13] sweep over my soul.
[36:19] Amen. That's what we desire that the
[36:21] Holy Spirit will just sweep over our
[36:23] soul this morning as we read the word of
[36:26] God. May God anoint his word. Amen.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; To our heart. I invite you to go in Luke
[36:32] 24:E5.
[36:34] Thank you musicians,
[36:36] song leaders, and God bless you richly
[36:39] and for each one for creating the
[36:40] atmosphere this morning.
[36:43] Luke 24:E5. That's where I will take my
[36:46] thought. But I'll read other other
[36:48] scriptures as we will be sitting down.
[36:52] Luke 24 verse 5
[37:01] can start four and five maybe six
[37:06] to give the context.
[37:11] is the sis or the sisters the woman went
[37:13] at the resurrection. The Bible says
[37:16] verse four and it came to pass as they
[37:18] were much perplexed thereabout.
[37:22] Behold two men stood by them in shining
[37:24] garment. And as they were afraid and
[37:28] bowed down their faces to the earth,
[37:31] they said unto them,
[37:33] why seek ye the living among the dead?
[37:37] telling the woman, "Why seeking he the
[37:39] living among the dead?
[37:42] &gt;&gt; He's not here, but he's risen."
[37:45] &gt;&gt; Remember how we spoke unto you when he
[37:48] was yet in Galilee. Let me just go to a
[37:52] word of word of prayer. Father, we thank
[37:54] you for the word of God. This word has
[37:56] not lost its power, Lord.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; As you spoke to the woman, Lord, that
[38:00] why you seeking me among the dead? I'm
[38:04] alive. I'm risen. I'm still the same
[38:07] yesterday, today, and forever. Father,
[38:10] may you change our attitude this morning
[38:12] to seek you among the living, not among
[38:14] the dead because you are still alive.
[38:16] Father,
[38:18] &gt;&gt; Father, bless this word to our heart and
[38:20] help us to accept it this morning with
[38:22] humility and love for you from you in
[38:26] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Can I have a seat? Amen.
[38:41] This is where I'm taking I said I'm
[38:43] taking my thought. Um
[38:45] um first of all thank the Lord for the
[38:48] good Friday service. I think it was a
[38:50] good service and uh
[38:53] &gt;&gt; brother Brent um it was good that he
[38:55] accepted the invitation and
[38:57] &gt;&gt; it's been a blessing. Amen.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And for those could stream or
[39:01] attend the meetings there as well. It
[39:04] was also good service. Uh my voice is a
[39:07] little bit not faithful this morning and
[39:11] been think I'm fighting something but
[39:14] the devil is trying to put something on
[39:16] me. I'm putting back I'm rejecting that.
[39:19] So it is not manifested yet. But uh uh
[39:23] just a little bit struggling sometimes.
[39:26] So um the angel told the woman, "Yeah,
[39:29] you come and you come here and you are
[39:31] so perplexed. You are so confused. You
[39:34] look so confused. You still think that
[39:37] he's dead. That's your attitude." Say,
[39:40] "But why are you you you're looking
[39:42] you're looking at the wrong place. This
[39:44] is an empty tomb. This is not here
[39:46] anymore.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; Why are you having that? Why are you
[39:49] thinking that he's still here?" Remember
[39:51] what he told you? He told you that on
[39:53] the third day I will be risen. But why
[39:56] are you coming and checking it? Why are
[39:57] you looking at the wrong place? This is
[39:59] the wrong place to look for him. Look at
[40:01] the place where he gave you the promise.
[40:03] Because he's risen. Because he's he's
[40:06] alive. He's living. You should not be
[40:08] sad. You should not be think looking at
[40:10] the problem. You should not looking at
[40:12] the worries. You should not That's not
[40:14] the attitude. No, you should be happy
[40:16] because he's risen. The Lord is risen.
[40:19] Amen.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; He's have everything under control.
[40:22] Amen. Glory to his name.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; So I'll read Matthew 27. Some of the
[40:28] scripture that the prophet read as I go
[40:31] to the scripture with you this morning
[40:33] just to give some comment. Matthew 27
[40:37] with that thought in in the mind. I
[40:38] think Luke is the one who who brought
[40:40] that that idea or that that that
[40:43] expression. You know all the four gospel
[40:45] if you want to read the resurrection not
[40:47] all of them are taking all the details.
[40:49] So you have to read all the four gospels
[40:52] to really get that picture of what is
[40:55] going on and to see because each one is
[40:57] focusing on one thing or the the other
[41:00] depending on the inspiration that God
[41:02] gave them and also the anointing that
[41:04] was on each and everyone. Amen.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I go in Matthew 27
[41:21] 62 start from 2762
[41:25] just before the resurrection.
[41:27] Now the next day that followed the day
[41:29] of preparation the chief priests and the
[41:32] Pharisees came together unto Pilate.
[41:35] They're saying sir we remember that that
[41:39] deceiver said while he was yet alive
[41:43] after three days I will rise again.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Think about it. The unbelievers were
[41:50] remembering what the Lord Jesus Christ
[41:52] said
[41:53] &gt;&gt; but the real believer could not remember
[41:56] what he told them. So the unbelievers
[41:59] out of fear that oh you we because they
[42:02] knew he was the true messiah. They they
[42:04] knew it. Nicodemus knew it. But they
[42:06] were just because of jealousy, because
[42:08] of the system they were in. They knew
[42:10] that whatever he said, he will he will
[42:13] accomplish what he said. But they were
[42:15] so scared for it being true. But they
[42:18] still remember it. But the true
[42:19] believers who were supposed to take to
[42:23] take action or to remember what he told
[42:25] them and on that third day to be
[42:27] expecting him to be raised. They were
[42:30] perplexed. They were confused. They
[42:31] didn't bless the scriptures. But these
[42:35] unbelievers,
[42:36] they come to try to stop the fulfillment
[42:39] of the scripture of God. But whatever
[42:42] they try to do can never stop the
[42:45] resurrection. You could never stop the
[42:47] resurrection. It had to happen because
[42:50] prophecy had to be fulfilled. Amen.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; They say after three days I will rise
[42:56] again. Say, command therefore that the
[42:59] sepico be made sure until the third day.
[43:04] Until the third day, so that even more
[43:06] precise on what the what he had talked
[43:09] that in three days I will rebuild this
[43:11] temple again.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Oh my, lest his disciple come by night
[43:16] and steal him away and say unto the
[43:19] people is risen from the dead. So the
[43:21] last error shall be worse than the
[43:24] first. Oh, actually it's not an arrow.
[43:27] It's the truth.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; The last truth shall be better than the
[43:32] first truth.
[43:34] So Pilate said unto them, you have a
[43:36] watch. Go your way. Make it as sure as
[43:39] you can. So there it's not it was not it
[43:42] was not the tomb where the you could
[43:45] just if it was risen it could just open
[43:47] the door nicely and come out. They made
[43:50] sure that he was completely sealed that
[43:53] that stone was really blocking him
[43:55] inside there. Amen. Think about it 2,000
[43:58] years ago. And so they went and made a
[44:01] separate shoe sealing the stone and
[44:05] setting a watch. So they put a stone
[44:07] there. I was checking what kind what
[44:09] kind of the seal was that the Roman was
[44:12] putting there and and the internet is
[44:14] saying that actually it was very hard to
[44:17] break that seal. It was very it's not it
[44:19] was not that I described in the many
[44:21] detail. I didn't take all the detail but
[44:22] they were saying that it was actually
[44:24] not one person could break that seal.
[44:26] You have to have a lot a big group of
[44:29] people to try to break one seal that the
[44:31] Roman seal were putting if they want to
[44:33] seal a house want to seal a prison. It
[44:35] was not just a easy
[44:38] you know like like the ceiling of our
[44:40] doors that you can just push and then we
[44:41] break. No, they make sure that you
[44:43] really completely seal that cannot come
[44:45] of it. Let me tell you, whatever the
[44:48] enemy is trying to block on your life,
[44:50] it can never stop the promise of God to
[44:52] be fulfilled. Amen. So they seal it
[44:56] properly so that you make sure that you
[44:58] cannot come of it. But the Bible says in
[45:00] the end of the Sabbath as it began to
[45:02] dawn towards the first day of the week
[45:06] came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary
[45:08] to see the supper and behold there was a
[45:11] great earthquake for the angel of the
[45:13] Lord descended from heaven and came and
[45:17] rolled back the stone from the door and
[45:19] he sat upon that storm. The same thing
[45:23] that was trying to block him, he rolled
[45:25] it with just his finger with the tip of
[45:28] his finger to remove it to show the
[45:30] power of God and himself went down and
[45:32] set upon that storm.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Whatever is trying to disturb you, let
[45:36] me the mighty angel is here to step on
[45:39] that stone and tell you that you can
[45:41] rise from that problem that you are
[45:43] going through.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; The Bible says his countenance was like
[45:48] lightning and his remnant white as snow.
[45:51] for fear him the keepers did shake those
[45:54] who were standing there for watch to
[45:56] prevent him from coming out. They were
[45:58] there and shaking and he became as dead
[46:00] man. And the angel answered and said
[46:03] unto the woman, fear he not for I know
[46:06] that you seek Jesus which was crucified.
[46:09] So that the scripture that that Luke is
[46:11] putting there that the angel talking to
[46:12] them I know fear not for I know that you
[46:15] seek Jesus which was crucified is not
[46:18] here for risen as he said come and see
[46:22] the place where the Lord lays and go
[46:25] quickly and tell his disciples that he's
[46:27] risen from the dead and behold he goeth
[46:30] before you into Galilee there shall ye
[46:33] see him lo I have told you. Amen. Oh,
[46:38] praise be to God. We thank God for the
[46:40] resurrection.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, I like to preach about resurrection.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Revelation 11:17, prophet use a
[46:50] scripture as well. And Easter Seal and
[46:54] the rising of the the sun, I believe.
[46:59] Just want to read as well. This is John
[47:03] as you saw in the aisle of Patmos.
[47:08] John 11:17 says
[47:13] when I saw him a Revelation 11:17,
[47:16] sorry, Revelation 117, sorry. And when I
[47:20] saw him, I fell at his feet as dead, and
[47:23] he laid his right hand upon me, saying
[47:25] unto me, Fear not. I am the first and
[47:28] the last. I am he that liveth and was
[47:31] dead, and behold, I am alive forever
[47:34] more. Amen. And I have the keys of hell
[47:38] and of death. Amen. Now you possess
[47:40] everything under his control. I have the
[47:43] keys of hell and death. It's not under
[47:46] the hands of the enemy anymore. Even
[47:48] Satan doesn't have the key of his own
[47:50] house. He doesn't have the key of hell
[47:52] that has been prepared for him. But God
[47:55] has everything under his hand.
[47:56] Everything under his control. That's why
[47:59] if I leave, you shall live as well.
[48:01] Because he live, we can face our
[48:03] tomorrows. Because he live, we should
[48:06] not have any fear. Because he live, we
[48:08] know that he knows our tomorrow. Amen.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; He's the God eternal one. Romans 8:11.
[48:14] And I'll be coming back to that as well
[48:16] at some point. Just put the introduction
[48:19] this morning.
[48:26] Just bring the word of God to
[48:28] remembrance uh to stir your
[48:32] mind and your spirit through the
[48:33] remembrance of the word of God. Romans
[48:35] 8:11.
[48:39] But if the spirit of him that raised up
[48:41] Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he
[48:43] that raised up Christ from the dead
[48:45] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[48:49] his spirit that dwelleth in you. Amen.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the resurrection is by the
[48:54] spirit that is dwelling in you. Amen.
[49:02] As we went through this week as a
[49:05] prophet will say it's a wonderful week.
[49:07] If there was
[49:09] anything any week we could remember in
[49:12] our Christian ministry and walk is is
[49:16] this week that we went we are going
[49:18] through or we are finishing now. Amen.
[49:20] The Easter week says, "Remember Jesus
[49:23] was a sheep. He was a lamb. But in this
[49:25] case, he became a goat. He was righteous
[49:28] because he was God. He was God the
[49:30] sheep. He come a goat sin. But he might
[49:34] be the sin offering for me and for you
[49:36] from a sheep to a goat." Jesus was
[49:40] represented in both animals, both goat.
[49:42] One he died. He died for the atonement.
[49:44] just put it as a statement to show his
[49:47] death and then his burring his rising
[49:50] and what he has done for our life. Amen.
[49:53] I said the second the sins from the
[49:55] atonement was put on the scapegoat and
[49:58] the scapegoat took the sins of the
[50:00] people went far into the wilderness to
[50:02] bear the sins of the people. What was
[50:05] it? It was the death and the burial of
[50:07] our Lord Jesus Christ. Says living the
[50:11] Lord loved me. Dying he saved me.
[50:13] buried. He carried my sins far away. He
[50:17] took the sins of the people upon himself
[50:19] and carried them plumbed down into the
[50:21] lowest of Hades. He was the sin
[50:24] offering. He had the sins of the people.
[50:27] He died for them. Do you believe that he
[50:29] died for you?
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. He died for you. And and also the
[50:34] sins was placed upon him. He took our
[50:36] sins far away so far that God could
[50:39] never remember, could never see them no
[50:42] more. Think of it. The church could
[50:44] scream hallelujah for such a savior.
[50:47] Amen. For such a savior who can take
[50:50] your sins and carry them far away to
[50:53] never remember them anymore. You take
[50:55] your sins, your pastor sins. As a
[50:57] brother Brent said, the pastor sins but
[50:59] also your future sins because we are
[51:02] human beings. We make mistakes. We die
[51:04] daily. Even our future sins are already
[51:07] taken far away to God. For a Christian,
[51:10] a Christian who's born again of God can
[51:12] never sin because sin is unbelief. You
[51:16] don't disbelieve consciously. Amen. You
[51:19] are not disbelieving but you make
[51:20] mistakes. Amen. Sometimes you make
[51:22] iniquities. Amen. Or you commit
[51:24] iniquities because you know the truth
[51:26] but you steal by your flesh because
[51:28] under pressure and you fall. Amen. But
[51:30] all those sins, all those iniquities, he
[51:34] has already bore upon himself. He took
[51:36] them far away to never remember them
[51:39] anymore. That's the power of our Lord
[51:42] Jesus Christ. So as he was into the
[51:44] grave, he didn't just die for the sake
[51:47] of dying. Amen. He died with a purpose.
[51:49] He had a purpose in mind because he was
[51:52] thinking of you. He was thinking of me.
[51:54] Amen. As he died, he took those sins of
[51:56] far. He became actually sin. He be he
[51:59] not only bore the sins but he became
[52:01] sin. Amen. He became even the the the
[52:04] our self even more than ourselves. He
[52:06] went to the very bottom where we should
[52:08] have been gone. It should have been our
[52:10] place. But he took our place. He went
[52:12] into hell to for our place because the
[52:16] judgment has to be paid. Amen.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Said not only is our sins forgiven, but
[52:23] they are buried in the sea of
[52:24] forgetfulness to be remembered no more.
[52:27] Buried, he carried my sins far away. No
[52:30] more can they be remembered for they are
[52:33] gone. They are out of the eyes of God.
[52:36] The righteous God cannot stand sin.
[52:39] They're taken out of the eyes of God.
[52:42] They are paralyzed. Amen. The sins are
[52:45] paralyzed. They are divorced. They're
[52:47] taken away. They put away. God doesn't
[52:50] remember them no more. The church ought
[52:53] to rejoice this morning to know that our
[52:57] sins will no more be remembered. Amen.
[53:00] They are put in the sea of forgetfulness
[53:02] into the grave of beyond any
[53:05] resurrection. They are put into the lake
[53:08] where there is no fishing anymore. But
[53:10] but you can't bring them back again. You
[53:13] sometimes it ask even reminding God
[53:16] about our sins. God remember I did this
[53:18] 10 years ago. God look it looks like I'm
[53:20] going back again. But the God doesn't
[53:22] remember them. And what are you talking
[53:24] about? God who is the infinite God has
[53:27] the ability to be infinite in
[53:29] forgetting. Amen.
[53:32] Oh, praise be to God.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; God who knows everything doesn't know
[53:37] our sin. Oh, he knows everything but he
[53:40] doesn't know our sin. He allows himself
[53:43] not to know our sins. Amen.
[53:46] Oh. Oh, we can say I said it this week.
[53:49] I've been repeating that many times, but
[53:51] every time I say it just blows my mind.
[53:53] Every time I said, "Oh god, I can't I
[53:55] can't imagine. I can't comprehend it. I
[53:57] can't understand it with my with my with
[54:00] my with my aunt or maybe my my insect
[54:03] insect memory."
[54:06] But God, infinite God cannot remember
[54:09] our sins. Cannot remember. He says they
[54:11] are dead. They are put
[54:14] to remember no more. Says, say they are
[54:17] put in the sea of forgiveness into the
[54:19] into the grave of beyond any
[54:21] resurrection. And they are dead forever
[54:23] and and they're forever and forgotten
[54:25] about. They are as if they had never
[54:28] happened. As if they have never
[54:30] happened. So he brought her to full
[54:33] reconciliation with him. Said dying he
[54:35] saved me but buried he carried my sins
[54:38] far away. He carried them so far till
[54:41] they went into the sea of forgetfulness.
[54:43] Oh we know that those things are most
[54:46] surely believed among us. But they are
[54:48] most surely the truth. They are God's
[54:50] truth. Amen. All those great things were
[54:53] beyond human expression. Even though we
[54:56] rejoice, but we can never express it the
[54:59] real way the way it should. We could
[55:01] never express our gratitude for such
[55:04] things as this. Amen. Oh, glory be to to
[55:07] his name. But not only were they buried,
[55:10] many people not only Jesus was buried,
[55:13] many people were buried. Many people
[55:15] have been buried. But this burial was to
[55:18] take our sins far away from the presence
[55:21] of God. That's different from the burial
[55:23] of any other person. As his death was
[55:26] different from any other person, no one
[55:28] could die as Jesus died because it was
[55:31] God in the human flesh in taking the
[55:34] human flesh to die on our place. Amen.
[55:37] No one could die as us. The prophet say
[55:39] no one lived as him. No one could die as
[55:41] him. Amen. We were not made in a point
[55:44] of coming to the point where we can die
[55:47] where the blood and and the water can
[55:49] get separated from our bodies. Only him
[55:52] could come to that point because he
[55:54] didn't die because of the of the spears.
[55:56] He didn't die because of the nails or
[55:58] didn't die because of the bleeding. He
[56:00] died because of the grief. Amen. He came
[56:02] to his own and his own did not receive
[56:04] him. That's why he could come to the
[56:06] point of dying like that. Amen. And now
[56:08] also as he was buried, he was buried as
[56:11] different as other people could have be
[56:13] buried because his burial was to take
[56:15] our sins far away from the presence of
[56:17] God. But also as he not only buried but
[56:21] he also risen from the dead. Amen.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Because many people died. Many prophet
[56:26] even did many great things. But he is
[56:28] the only one who could die and also come
[56:30] back. Amen.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Many people could raise the dead. You
[56:33] know that many prophet raised the dead.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Elisha raised the dead and then
[56:39] raised the dead. Many people raised the
[56:41] dead. Many prophet raised the Jesus
[56:42] Christ raised the dead. So Lazarus died
[56:45] and Jesus rose him back. Amen. Many
[56:48] people die. So dying and coming back.
[56:50] Yeah, that's a miracles. But the fact
[56:53] that he came back the resurrection by
[56:55] itself is not is not only a miracle.
[56:57] It's not as a big miracle as should. But
[56:59] the difference is
[57:01] he gave his life and he took back it
[57:04] back himself. No one was able to give
[57:08] his life and take it back himself. That
[57:12] was the greatest miracle. He could die
[57:14] and take it back himself. Amen. The same
[57:17] Holy Spirit that was him, that's the
[57:19] same spirit that raised him from the
[57:21] dead. Amen. That same spirit that raised
[57:24] him from the dead as we spoke like that
[57:25] day is the same spirit God has sent into
[57:28] us. Amen. That's what makes the
[57:30] resurrection special. Amen. Because it's
[57:33] God himself giving himself life back to
[57:37] himself. Amen.
[57:39] Oh, wonderful. Listen to other
[57:41] prophecies. What was that raising up? It
[57:44] was God's receipt that the bill has been
[57:47] paid. Rising is justified freely
[57:50] forever. What a savior rising. What God
[57:54] has done. A man can suffer. A man can
[57:56] die. A man can be buried. But Easter was
[58:00] the greatest of them all. For it was
[58:02] God's endorsement.
[58:05] My laws has been met. My requirement has
[58:07] been met that him. He rose him up from
[58:10] the dead. He rose him up from the dead.
[58:12] Rising is justified freely forever.
[58:15] Blessed be his holy name. No wonder it
[58:18] brings emotions. Amen. No wonder the
[58:21] human heart can never contain it. With
[58:23] our conquering faith, we can stand
[58:25] yonder and say we are justified freely
[58:28] forever because he died and he was
[58:31] buried and was and God raised him up
[58:34] again on Easter morning. Then God showed
[58:36] that it was accepted. All the things
[58:39] that he did was accepted. Amen. He could
[58:42] he died. He he paid for our price. He
[58:44] was buried. He took our sins far away.
[58:47] But all that had to be accepted. The way
[58:50] to show that he has been accepted was
[58:52] God to raise him up again. He had to
[58:55] raise him up to show that I have
[58:56] accepted what he have done. If all these
[58:58] things were done and there was no
[59:00] resurrection, it would have been been a
[59:02] missed target. Amen. But thank God he
[59:05] raised him up from the dead to say I
[59:07] have accepted everything that you have
[59:10] done. My people can declare now they are
[59:12] free. Amen. Justified forever. Amen. as
[59:16] if as if you have never done it to begin
[59:18] with.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; So then God show that he raised him up
[59:23] again on this. God showed that he
[59:25] accepted all the things that he did.
[59:26] Everything is freely paid. You can go
[59:29] free now. Rising is justified freely
[59:32] forever. No one can never know can never
[59:35] think of that great day when he rose up.
[59:38] And the angels saw it in the heavens of
[59:40] heaven. The angels sang the praises of
[59:43] God and rejoiced. While the Old
[59:45] Testament saints in paradise shouted,
[59:47] "Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Is risen."
[59:50] Amen.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; That's why we call it the Easter Seal.
[59:56] The boy call it's a Easter Seal. It
[59:58] sealed the word of God forever for the
[1:00:01] true believer. The Easter Seal prove
[1:00:03] that what he talked, what he said, what
[1:00:06] he promised has been the truth. Amen.
[1:00:09] what he said. He could also confirm by
[1:00:11] the resurrection that what everything
[1:00:13] I've been saying has been the truth
[1:00:15] because I gave my life and I can take it
[1:00:18] back myself. Amen. The Holy Spirit rose
[1:00:20] him up from the from the grave. All
[1:00:23] gloom, all doubt are shattered at that
[1:00:26] blessful morning. Oh, man had been shut
[1:00:30] up. It was in a prison house even to
[1:00:32] religious people before this day because
[1:00:34] because they seen great religions move
[1:00:37] moving of the Holy Spirit and so forth.
[1:00:39] But when a man died, it seemed to
[1:00:42] settled. When this one came, he said, "I
[1:00:45] have power to lay my life down. I have
[1:00:48] power to take it up again." Moses was a
[1:00:51] great man. Elijah was a great man.
[1:00:53] Isaiah was a great man. Jeremiah was a
[1:00:55] great man. All the prophet was a great
[1:00:56] man. John the Baptist was a great man.
[1:00:58] But no one could die and come back by
[1:01:00] himself. Amen. But this man when he
[1:01:03] comes, he could lay down his life and
[1:01:05] and bring it back again. Because he
[1:01:07] lives, you shall live as well. Amen. He
[1:01:10] prove that his word is true. So you can
[1:01:12] rely upon his own word. Amen.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, we should never take lightly the
[1:01:17] great resurrection of God. My prayer is
[1:01:20] that each one of us know God in the
[1:01:22] power of the resurrection
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; to know him to realize that I have
[1:01:26] myself also a Easter with God. I was
[1:01:29] raised with Jesus Christ as well. God
[1:01:31] make that a reality in my heart Lord
[1:01:33] that I have I know you in the power of
[1:01:35] the resurrection.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; So I have power to take it up again.
[1:01:41] Then God prove what is said to me that
[1:01:44] that's the seal of it. When something is
[1:01:46] said and then is turned around and
[1:01:48] proven, it is the ultimate proof because
[1:01:51] it show the only thing that no one else
[1:01:54] could defeat.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; No matter how great you are, no matter
[1:01:57] how rich you are, no matter how many
[1:02:00] miracles you have performed, even if you
[1:02:02] have raised the dead, you can't raise
[1:02:04] yourself up. No matter what you can do,
[1:02:07] you can't raise yourself up.
[1:02:10] Glory to God. Only one person could give
[1:02:13] his life and take it back is our Lord
[1:02:16] Jesus Christ. Now one man has conquered
[1:02:18] death. That's why we call it the seal of
[1:02:21] God. The Easter Seal. It's sealed the
[1:02:23] word of God. He confirmed that he was
[1:02:25] God. Amen.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise be to God. I want to praise.
[1:02:30] I want to glorify him. I want to raise
[1:02:32] him up because he's the only one who
[1:02:33] deserve to be glorified. Is the one to
[1:02:36] be worshiped. Is one to say, "God, you
[1:02:38] are worthy of everything." Amen. I don't
[1:02:41] want to look to you to search for you
[1:02:44] among the dead. We mean I don't want to
[1:02:46] look to you only a god of history.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; I want the God of today. Yes. You are
[1:02:51] the same God because it's you who did
[1:02:53] that. It's you who sent the prophet.
[1:02:56] It's you who confirmed your word. You
[1:02:58] can confirm your word in my life today.
[1:03:00] Amen. You are the same yesterday, today
[1:03:03] and forever. Resurrection yesterday, but
[1:03:06] resurrection today as well.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. It says, "When he proved by his
[1:03:12] promise the great conquering power that
[1:03:14] he had on Easter, he proved that he
[1:03:16] could conquer death, hell, and the
[1:03:18] grave. I am he that was dead and is
[1:03:21] alive again and alive forever more. And
[1:03:24] I have the keys to death and hell and
[1:03:26] the grave." What a statement for anyone
[1:03:29] to make. Not only did he make it, but he
[1:03:32] had already proved it. He had what he
[1:03:34] claimed to have. Amen. The only one who
[1:03:37] could claim what he had to have. That's
[1:03:39] why our Christian religion is the only
[1:03:41] one that has an empty tomb. No other
[1:03:45] religion has an empty tomb. Only a
[1:03:47] Christian religion has an empty tomb.
[1:03:50] You can search him everywhere. You can't
[1:03:52] find his bones because he's risen from
[1:03:54] the dead. Amen. That proves to me that
[1:03:57] he is the God of the dead, the God of
[1:03:59] the living. He could raise the dead and
[1:04:01] back to life again. The quickening
[1:04:03] power, the quickening spirit of his has
[1:04:05] proved through the years that he is the
[1:04:07] one who can quicken the dead back to
[1:04:09] life again. Amen. He showed that he
[1:04:12] defeated Satan. He defeated Satan
[1:04:15] completely. Satan certainly didn't know
[1:04:17] who he was. But after the resurrection,
[1:04:20] oh certainly he knows who he is because
[1:04:23] he met him beyond there. You know when
[1:04:25] he went when he was buried there, he met
[1:04:27] him over there. Satan was waiting for
[1:04:29] him. I Oh, I got him. I think he's just
[1:04:31] like the other prophet. Let me wait for
[1:04:33] him here as he's coming over there. Let
[1:04:35] me see how I'm going to put him again in
[1:04:37] this in this place here that they called
[1:04:39] the paradise. I'm going to put him like
[1:04:41] the other prophet. As he's coming there,
[1:04:44] Satan was is he like the other prophet
[1:04:46] or what's going
[1:04:48] as he come there you see declared to him
[1:04:51] Satan you see my blood there is not the
[1:04:52] blood of a prophet. It's not the blood
[1:04:54] of Mary. It's not the blood of any other
[1:04:56] human. It's the blood of God himself. It
[1:04:58] was the creative cell of God. It was the
[1:05:01] blood of God himself. I'm not saved by
[1:05:03] the blood of the Jew. I'm not saved by
[1:05:05] the blood of Gentile. I'm saved by the
[1:05:07] blood of God himself. That's my blood is
[1:05:09] still fresh there. So give me those key
[1:05:12] Satan. Amen.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; African preacher say kick Satan.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Have a preacher
[1:05:25] use even an African native language.
[1:05:27] Kick him properly. Give me those key.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; So he was going out. He said there is
[1:05:36] nobody else that believed him. Way over
[1:05:38] yond in paradise there is a group of
[1:05:40] believer couldn't enter into the
[1:05:41] presence of the father because they went
[1:05:44] under the burnt offering. Sheep goats
[1:05:47] sprinkling of ashes. They could not go
[1:05:50] in the presence of the father because
[1:05:52] animal blood would not could not atone
[1:05:55] for sin. That's why they were put in
[1:05:57] that temporary place called paradise
[1:06:00] because they couldn't go in in a place.
[1:06:02] They couldn't go in the presence of God.
[1:06:04] They had to wait there. No matter how
[1:06:06] saint they were, no matter Oh, they've
[1:06:08] done great things. By faith, Abel did
[1:06:11] it. By faith, Abraham did this. By
[1:06:13] faith, Enoch did this. By faith, all
[1:06:16] these, you know, Enoch was in the
[1:06:18] presence of God. But by by faith, all
[1:06:19] the others, they couldn't come in the
[1:06:21] presence of God because they were under
[1:06:23] that blood. It says it was just a
[1:06:26] substitute. There was the place called
[1:06:28] paradise. It's getting towards break of
[1:06:30] day. So the morning of the break of day,
[1:06:33] I can see him as he comes up to that
[1:06:35] door. Brother Bam, the Bible, the the
[1:06:38] translator says, "Brother Bam knocks
[1:06:39] four times." Sarah said, "Abraham, go
[1:06:42] open the door. See who that is." That
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Abraham walks out and opens the door and
[1:06:47] said, "Come here, honey. Come and see.
[1:06:50] Look and see." Oh, who's standing there?
[1:06:52] that the same one that come and eat with
[1:06:55] us that day under the or is the same
[1:06:57] one. I know he's the Messiah. He's the
[1:07:00] one who came in type but he's there.
[1:07:03] Amen. Says, "Oh, about that time I can
[1:07:05] see Daniel saying, what did you say?"
[1:07:07] Oh, he said, "Oh, there is that the
[1:07:11] stone I saw who of the mountain. There
[1:07:14] he is." is the Messiah is there.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to them. Ezekiel said, "What
[1:07:19] did you say, Daniel?" Yeah. So there he
[1:07:20] is is the will in the middle of the
[1:07:23] wheel. That's what I prophesied about.
[1:07:25] This is now the fulfillment. Amen. The
[1:07:27] scent of all could see that and rejoice.
[1:07:30] Now we are here on the other side. We
[1:07:33] could look back and say that's the same.
[1:07:35] Amen. But not only there, but he's also
[1:07:37] here.
[1:07:41] [Music]
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; He said, and Job jumped and said, what
[1:07:46] did you say? He said, that one I saw. I
[1:07:49] said, "I know my redeemer liveth. At the
[1:07:52] last day he will stand upon the earth.
[1:07:54] Though the skin worms destroyed his
[1:07:56] body, yet in my flesh I shall see God."
[1:07:59] Say there he is that him. I recognize
[1:08:02] him. The prophet and said looked upon
[1:08:04] and recognized him. They were waiting
[1:08:06] for him. Say children get ready. We are
[1:08:09] going out there. Blessed be the name of
[1:08:11] the Lord. I'm so glad that my book my
[1:08:15] name or my book is on or my app in
[1:08:17] heaven. The prophecy, my name is on the
[1:08:19] register. I'm so glad that my sins are
[1:08:22] under the blood signed pardoned.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; It says by his own precious blood. I'm
[1:08:27] so glad that I know him. The prophet
[1:08:29] says, I'm sure that every Christian can
[1:08:32] say amen to God.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Are you happy for the resurrection this
[1:08:36] morning?
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; So, I'm glad that one of these mornings
[1:08:40] he will come for us. I can hear Abraham
[1:08:42] say, "What did you say, Lord?" He said
[1:08:44] I'm always it's almost daylight on it's
[1:08:47] not Sunday morning that early morning.
[1:08:50] So it's almost daylight on earth. You
[1:08:52] remember on the third day I had to rise.
[1:08:55] So they had a a little bit of fellowship
[1:08:57] behind there. It's almost morning
[1:08:59] according to the scriptures. I have to
[1:09:01] rise.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Says well that's right. I hear Abraham
[1:09:04] say listen God. Can we make a little
[1:09:07] whistle stop? Sarah and I have been
[1:09:10] wanting to look around the old land for
[1:09:13] a long time. Can we make just a little
[1:09:15] whistle stop and said, "Oh, I'm going to
[1:09:17] walk to talk to my disciple for 30 days,
[1:09:20] for 40 days. You can have plenty of time
[1:09:23] on Easter morning when the sun was about
[1:09:26] ready to shine. The morning star come
[1:09:28] from the skies and rolled back the stop
[1:09:30] sun, the the storm storm." And the Bible
[1:09:32] said many of those saints that slept in
[1:09:35] the dust of the earth rose and come up
[1:09:37] in the city and appeared to many. Amen.
[1:09:40] So in that morning as they come out from
[1:09:43] that place, oh many saints came up with
[1:09:46] him as well. People could now notice
[1:09:48] them. Oh, oh, oh, this is a stranger
[1:09:51] here. What what's going on here? I never
[1:09:53] I never seen this one. Oh, that lovely
[1:09:56] couple Abraham and and Sarah young and
[1:09:59] walking
[1:10:01] resurrection power. Amen. The first
[1:10:03] resurrection. Now remember the second
[1:10:05] resurrection. Our first resurrection for
[1:10:07] the bride. Now what will happen? There
[1:10:09] will be also a 40 days for us as a type
[1:10:12] where we will see our loved ones coming.
[1:10:14] Oh, I see my mother there. I see my
[1:10:15] father there. I see my older brother
[1:10:17] there. I see the saints there. I use I
[1:10:19] see that brother there. Oh, what a day
[1:10:21] that looking forward for us. Amen.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:25] Matthew 27:42 just to confirm what the
[1:10:27] Bible says. And the graves was open,
[1:10:30] many bodies of the saints which slept
[1:10:32] arose and came out of the graves after
[1:10:35] his resurrection and went into the holy
[1:10:38] city and appeared unto many.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; So as say the old animal lamp was a type
[1:10:44] and his blood could never could never
[1:10:46] take away sins. He just covered sins.
[1:10:49] Amen. Yeah.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; So, Satan still had control over the
[1:10:52] keys over there. But the reason there
[1:10:54] was a place called paradise and the
[1:10:56] gathering of the fathers where the old
[1:10:58] tent went where they died. But when
[1:11:00] Jesus died, sin wasn't covered. It was
[1:11:03] divorced and done away with. But when
[1:11:06] Jesus died, sin wasn't only covered, but
[1:11:09] was divorced and done away with it. Then
[1:11:12] he emptied paradise and led captive
[1:11:15] captive and give gift unto man. The Old
[1:11:17] Testament saints went with him after his
[1:11:19] resurrection and appeared in the city
[1:11:21] appeared before many people that in the
[1:11:23] city. Matthew 27. Amen.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Now then we go we go into
[1:11:28] the presence of the father waiting the
[1:11:30] second coming of the Lord." It says,
[1:11:32] "Now after Jesus resurrection, the old
[1:11:34] saint of the Old Testament come out of
[1:11:36] the graves and went into glory with the
[1:11:38] Lord Jesus Christ according to Matthew
[1:11:40] 27." That's right. Now when we go we go
[1:11:43] into the presence of the father waiting
[1:11:45] the second coming of the lord now there
[1:11:48] is no guess work on it all finished work
[1:11:53] that's why we don't feel there amen
[1:11:55] because the the price has already been
[1:11:57] paid the gap is only a door to go to
[1:12:00] another dimension actually it's just
[1:12:03] heaven is not very far it's just another
[1:12:06] dimension there just another few me few
[1:12:09] meters amen We're going the other side.
[1:12:12] So I just saw my body over there. He had
[1:12:15] the proof that that land is real. Pastor
[1:12:18] preached one time, heaven is real. Amen.
[1:12:20] It's a real place. It's not a myth. It's
[1:12:22] not an imagination. It's a real place.
[1:12:24] Amen.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Because the price has already been paid.
[1:12:28] Amen.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Coming back to the idea, the Pharisees
[1:12:37] and Satan had tried by all means to try
[1:12:40] to keep him from the grave. They put the
[1:12:42] best gods they could find. They put a
[1:12:45] big stone. They put a Roman seal to make
[1:12:47] sure that no one could open it. The
[1:12:50] Bible says they made the separ.
[1:12:53] Let's keep him inside. Let's make sure
[1:12:55] that that the resurrection doesn't
[1:12:56] happen.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's keep the son of God
[1:13:00] there. Let's make sure that nothing
[1:13:02] happens to him. Let's put the Roman seal
[1:13:04] to keep the germ of life from coming
[1:13:06] forth. No stone could keep him from
[1:13:08] coming forth. Unfortunately, amen. The
[1:13:11] scripture says it had to be fulfilled.
[1:13:13] He broke the seal. Amen. May God break
[1:13:17] the seal of our life. anything that is
[1:13:19] hindering us, anything that is blocking
[1:13:21] us, anything that is keeping you down,
[1:13:23] may God break the seal in our life on
[1:13:25] this Easter Seal and break that. Let the
[1:13:27] life of God come forth. Amen. Amen.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; No matter what the enemy has tried to
[1:13:32] put on you to prevent you from believing
[1:13:34] this message, one day when the light
[1:13:37] strike that seed in your soul, a seed in
[1:13:41] your heart, no matter what the devil has
[1:13:44] tried in your life, maybe put you down,
[1:13:45] maybe you go in a path in in a very dark
[1:13:48] path in your youth, maybe went to a
[1:13:49] different place, maybe the devil has
[1:13:51] tried to do many things in your life,
[1:13:53] but when that light strike your the seed
[1:13:57] in your heart, Nothing could stop you
[1:14:00] from responding to the word of God. I am
[1:14:02] a son of God. I am a daughter of God.
[1:14:05] Who did that? It's the power of the
[1:14:07] resurrection in your heart. You already
[1:14:10] had the resurrection.
[1:14:12] Amen.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:20] The prophet says,
[1:14:22] I'm going to inject a little thought
[1:14:24] here and think that it's a Baptist and
[1:14:26] you'll think it's a Baptist, but it's
[1:14:28] not. The Bible, there was those
[1:14:30] welltrained scholar looked upon that
[1:14:32] sign that he had and called him a devil.
[1:14:35] But here is a prostitute, but in her lay
[1:14:38] that predestinated seed of God.
[1:14:42] Amen.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; She never seen nothing like that. As
[1:14:46] soon as that light struck that seed,
[1:14:48] life sprung up. It had life in it to
[1:14:52] begin with. It says the same like you in
[1:14:55] in the natural it fall of the year. The
[1:14:57] seeds die and go down into the dirt. But
[1:15:00] let that sound just strike it. If the
[1:15:03] germ of life, the germ of life is there,
[1:15:05] it will spring to life. This woman had a
[1:15:08] horrible she was predestinated. Her name
[1:15:11] was put on the lamb's book of life
[1:15:13] before the foundation of the world. And
[1:15:15] when she see that light of God spring,
[1:15:18] nothing could hold her. It sprang to
[1:15:21] life. The Pharisees, they look white
[1:15:23] from the outside, but they were dark
[1:15:25] inside. She was dark from the outside,
[1:15:28] but inside there was that seed journey
[1:15:30] of God. Amen. When the lights come and
[1:15:32] she saw that, she responded to that
[1:15:34] light. No matter what the enemy is
[1:15:36] trying to put down, to put in darkness,
[1:15:38] to put the seal, to put the seal upon
[1:15:41] our life, to put a definition upon our
[1:15:44] life. You are a prostitute. You can't
[1:15:45] mix with the others and every other
[1:15:47] thing. But God had a different plan for
[1:15:50] her. God had different vision for her.
[1:15:53] He knew her before the foundation of the
[1:15:55] world. God knew you before the
[1:15:57] foundation of the world. Nothing can
[1:15:59] change his love for you because he
[1:16:01] already loved you. You already accepted
[1:16:04] in him. Amen. So when he died, you died
[1:16:06] with him. When he rose from the grave,
[1:16:08] you rose with him. Amen. That's why you
[1:16:11] are part of him. Amen.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise be to God. When we see that,
[1:16:15] oh, it just makes you to rejoice.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Thank God. Thank God for your grace in
[1:16:19] my life. Thank you for choosing me. Not
[1:16:22] today, choosing me before the foundation
[1:16:24] of the world.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Glory to your name. Amen.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; When educated priests they said well the
[1:16:31] the the that holy father so and so I
[1:16:34] don't care what it was Jesus said you
[1:16:36] are with your father the devil and his
[1:16:38] works you do that prostitute said you
[1:16:40] must be the messiah
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; says when he told her he was she was
[1:16:45] convinced what that predestinated seed
[1:16:48] when the light first shine she
[1:16:51] recognized it. Amen.
[1:16:56] And the same thing happened to you and
[1:16:57] me. Says you believe that we shall rise
[1:17:01] in him. We become part of him. The
[1:17:04] Easter, the revealed secret of God like
[1:17:06] it was then of life after death. We are
[1:17:08] now alive who were once dead in sin and
[1:17:11] trespasses. The true seal seal, the true
[1:17:15] Easter seal has broken death from around
[1:17:18] me and I'm alive. The Easter seal at the
[1:17:21] beginning broke all the seal of the
[1:17:22] Roman seal. The Easter seal that was
[1:17:25] that that he was sealed up and man they
[1:17:28] died and and was gone. But he broke that
[1:17:30] seal and reveal your secret. Now God by
[1:17:33] his holy spirit has broken the seal from
[1:17:36] around our lives and Christ is revealed
[1:17:39] as he lives in us. Amen. So let that
[1:17:42] seal be broken. Amen. So that Christ can
[1:17:44] be revealed in us. Now we are quickened
[1:17:47] with him. Oh, amen.
[1:17:49] Amen.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Glory to his name.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Glory to his name.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; As we read in the Bible, and behold,
[1:18:01] there was a great earthquake and the
[1:18:02] angel of the Lord descended from heaven
[1:18:04] came and sat and came and rolled up the
[1:18:08] stone from the door and sat upon it. It
[1:18:10] means he controls. You think that the
[1:18:12] situations and situ and situation and
[1:18:15] circumstances are controlling you? No.
[1:18:17] The angel will roll back the stone and
[1:18:20] will control. That's what said fear not.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Fear not.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Fear is the biggest curse can be put
[1:18:28] upon on the believer because it
[1:18:30] paralyzes your faith. Fear or what if
[1:18:33] this happen? What if this happen? Oh,
[1:18:36] sometimes you know how many remember
[1:18:39] during COVID you hear so much negative
[1:18:41] things and you start feeling like you
[1:18:43] have it.
[1:18:46] So you know what? Oh, if you're in a
[1:18:49] shower, you feel like you don't you
[1:18:50] don't breathe properly in shower. The
[1:18:52] symptom of a co that is not manifested
[1:18:54] here. So every as I'm taking a shower,
[1:18:58] I feel like
[1:19:01] no you don't just feel.
[1:19:04] Oh my.
[1:19:07] Oh, that's the trouble with people
[1:19:09] tonight. The prophet said, you are
[1:19:11] scared. The biggest curse that there is
[1:19:13] on the full gospel people or any other
[1:19:15] people is because you are afraid. God
[1:19:18] has made a provision but you are afraid
[1:19:20] to take the word for it. We should not
[1:19:23] take what the devil is giving. We take
[1:19:24] what the word of God is giving. We
[1:19:27] should put our trust in the word of God.
[1:19:30] If Jesus Christ was the manifested word,
[1:19:32] the anointed word and he had to believe
[1:19:35] the word of God. Jesus Christ went into
[1:19:37] the grave believing one scriptures.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. I shall not leave my anointed one
[1:19:42] unto the grave. He shall not see
[1:19:44] corruption upon one scriptures. But he
[1:19:47] knew that God cannot break his own word.
[1:19:50] On the third day I shall come up again.
[1:19:53] If God if God Jesus Christ could go into
[1:19:56] the grave with one scriptures how many
[1:19:58] how much more us as a believer we can
[1:20:01] face Laia with God's promises in our
[1:20:04] time. Amen. I will have a bride and God
[1:20:07] has a bride. Amen. No matter what Leesia
[1:20:10] is putting upon you, you shall be an
[1:20:12] overcomer because he lives. You shall
[1:20:14] live as well. Amen.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Since that one of the scriptures that
[1:20:22] more neglected,
[1:20:24] there's going to one part where it's
[1:20:26] been accepted, but I think I I'll skip
[1:20:28] that part where
[1:20:31] just to show has been accepted.
[1:20:38] But when you see him in the evening,
[1:20:39] Jesus Jesus Christ, it means the
[1:20:42] sacrifice has been accepted. Because the
[1:20:44] Bible says in Hebrews 9, but but Christ
[1:20:47] being come and a high priest of good
[1:20:49] things to come by his own blood, he
[1:20:52] entered in once into the holy place,
[1:20:54] having obtained eternal redemption for
[1:20:57] us. It's not a partial redemption, is
[1:21:00] eternal redemption because we already
[1:21:03] been part of him. Now he's bringing us
[1:21:05] back to our position. Amen.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Because we were him. We were with him.
[1:21:10] We got lost. Amen. We put a we put a
[1:21:13] pawn shop and then now he comes and he's
[1:21:15] looking for us. Like that that like that
[1:21:17] eagle. Mother eagle is looking for I
[1:21:19] know that I have my son. I know I have I
[1:21:21] had another egg. I know but someone took
[1:21:24] it from him. But I will go and search
[1:21:25] for him. It's not someone was looking
[1:21:28] for you. It was God was looking for you.
[1:21:30] It was the eagle was looking for you.
[1:21:32] It's the Holy Ghost was going and find
[1:21:35] you. Amen. It's God who called you, not
[1:21:37] man called you. If someone called you,
[1:21:39] oh, you need to reject that calling
[1:21:41] again. It has to be God calling you.
[1:21:43] Amen. If God calls you, reveals to you
[1:21:46] the word of God. You should be thankful
[1:21:48] because God called you. If God call you,
[1:21:51] no one can take you out. No one can can
[1:21:54] remove you from the church. No one can
[1:21:56] remove you from the message. The message
[1:21:58] and you you are one. Amen. You are part
[1:22:00] of the message. I'm the message. I'm the
[1:22:02] revival. I'm the proof of the
[1:22:05] resurrection. Can you tell me that Jesus
[1:22:07] Christ is raised from the dead? I'm the
[1:22:09] proof of the resurrection. Look, I was
[1:22:11] dead, but now I'm alive. The same spirit
[1:22:14] that was in God in Jesus Christ, the
[1:22:16] same spirit is in me.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; I'm the proof of his resurrection.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Eternal redemption.
[1:22:34] So he says
[1:22:36] I like that story of of the of the
[1:22:38] saints going into the the city. Says I'm
[1:22:42] going up for 40 days a night with my
[1:22:43] disciple and go to them for some
[1:22:46] lecturers before they go. So we are
[1:22:49] going to make a little whistle stop and
[1:22:52] stop that place. And about that time the
[1:22:53] angel of God rolled away the stone. Then
[1:22:56] the Bible continues. and says
[1:22:59] and I rose out of the grave in mortal
[1:23:00] bodies like the old said when what I can
[1:23:04] see kaifas standing say what is all that
[1:23:07] noise this morning you priests the
[1:23:09] priests say I don't know the only thing
[1:23:11] there are people appearing everywhere
[1:23:13] around the cities here some of them
[1:23:15] claim they are all saints they are
[1:23:17] resurrected
[1:23:19] well kifa says I don't know say say
[1:23:23] what is that young couple coming there
[1:23:25] says it's Sarah and Abra I'm walking
[1:23:27] along and say look here honey you
[1:23:30] remember that old place where we come
[1:23:31] down that hill yonder yeah I remember
[1:23:34] that oh we are we are being watched oh
[1:23:36] we are being watched I was just vanished
[1:23:39] just like the kind of the body had right
[1:23:41] into the building through the walls they
[1:23:44] didn't even know oh his glorious body
[1:23:47] they were walking here on earth and
[1:23:49] appearing to people hallelujah yes they
[1:23:51] are 40 days so they have a body they
[1:23:54] just coming and disappearing coming and
[1:23:55] disappear coming and disappear When I
[1:23:57] look at that to say, "Oh God, thank you.
[1:23:58] Thank you. We are going our future is
[1:24:00] better. Our future is brighter." Amen.
[1:24:03] We will have a body like his glorious
[1:24:05] body. If in the type if even in the
[1:24:07] first resurrection that he did there and
[1:24:09] the first coming of the Lord, he did
[1:24:10] like this. What about our second coming
[1:24:13] when he shall come, we shall have
[1:24:15] glorious body like his own body. Thank
[1:24:19] God for the resurrection. Amen. Amen.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Says and here goes up. I can see Sarah.
[1:24:28] So, here they go passing the moon and
[1:24:30] the stars. Jesus at a head. The Old
[1:24:32] Testament behind him walking saying,
[1:24:35] "Hallelujah." They come in sight of the
[1:24:38] big great city yonder that built four
[1:24:40] squares polygaras. I can hear all the
[1:24:43] Old Testament said with the great victor
[1:24:46] walking into the front of them, great
[1:24:48] conqueror. He is a mighty conqueror
[1:24:50] since he ran to the veil in two. Here he
[1:24:53] is with the Old Testament saying I can
[1:24:55] hear them. Hold up. Lift up he
[1:24:58] everlasting gates and be lifted up. Let
[1:25:01] the king of glory come in. I hear the
[1:25:04] angels say what was that? They say lift
[1:25:07] up he everlasting gates and be lifted
[1:25:09] up. Let the king of glory come in. I can
[1:25:13] hear the angels hold. Who is the king of
[1:25:16] glory? And they answer the Lord of hosts
[1:25:19] mighty in battle is the king of glory.
[1:25:23] Hallelujah.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; The old saint they just had a
[1:25:27] resurrection. They experienced that and
[1:25:30] they know that what how real it was and
[1:25:32] this is what what they going through.
[1:25:34] But let me remind you and remind you
[1:25:36] this is what we are going to go through
[1:25:38] as well. Amen. We there will be a body
[1:25:41] change one time. There will be a
[1:25:43] resurrection one time. But to be part of
[1:25:46] that body chain, to be part of that
[1:25:48] resurrection, you need to have a
[1:25:49] resurrection of the soul now. Amen. You
[1:25:52] need to have a quickening of the Holy
[1:25:54] Spirit now. Amen.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; That's why I want to make that
[1:26:05] transitions.
[1:26:07] We need the quickening of the Holy
[1:26:09] Spirit. Now see Jesus Christ blood just
[1:26:13] as sufficient it is. yesterday,
[1:26:16] today, and forever. To every age, to
[1:26:19] save every sinner, heal every sick
[1:26:21] person, bring every miracle, every sign
[1:26:23] to pass, seven times way back beyond in
[1:26:26] the Old Testament, 1490 years before
[1:26:28] Christ. Think of it. It says in the high
[1:26:31] priest with Jesus Christ, that is more
[1:26:33] sufficient for every day of our work.
[1:26:35] But in 1 Corinthians 15:17 says, "If
[1:26:38] Christ be not raised, our faith is
[1:26:40] vain." That's right. you are yet in your
[1:26:44] sins. Then they also which are fallen
[1:26:47] asleep in Christ are perished. If in
[1:26:50] this life only we have hope in Christ,
[1:26:52] we are of all men most miserable. But
[1:26:56] now is Christ risen from the dead and
[1:26:58] become the first fruits of them that
[1:27:00] slept. So if Christ died, it was not
[1:27:03] just for him is to show an example that
[1:27:06] there will be others who will come after
[1:27:08] me who can who will be raised from the
[1:27:10] dead as well. So it was the first fruit
[1:27:12] of them that slept. For since by man
[1:27:15] came death, by man came also the
[1:27:17] resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam
[1:27:20] all died, even so in Christ shall all be
[1:27:23] made alive. But every man in own in his
[1:27:27] own order, Christ the first fruit,
[1:27:29] afterward they that are Christ at his
[1:27:32] coming. Let me say though this I'm
[1:27:35] changing a bit the angle here. Most
[1:27:37] people believe in the resurrection of
[1:27:39] the Lord Jesus Christ. Many churches
[1:27:41] celebrate the resurrection of Jesus
[1:27:43] Christ. They put it but the only thing
[1:27:45] they put it in historical event
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; which is true which is rejoice about.
[1:27:51] Amen. But they feel disconnected from
[1:27:54] that historical event because that's
[1:27:57] what happened there. We rejoice today.
[1:27:59] But it's not only a historical event. It
[1:28:02] is a historical event but have
[1:28:05] consequences today.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. and also similarities on what God
[1:28:09] is doing today. And that's the part they
[1:28:12] are missing. Amen. No, they're not good
[1:28:14] people. They're very good people. We
[1:28:15] thank all them. But we thank God for
[1:28:18] bring that connection of what he has
[1:28:19] done and what he's doing now. And we
[1:28:22] thank God for what he's also doing now.
[1:28:25] Because what a resurrection it was then,
[1:28:26] but what a resurrection this is is as
[1:28:29] well to bring us to the same body
[1:28:32] change, to the same victory, to the same
[1:28:35] resurrection. Amen.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Now you are not and should not be
[1:28:39] disconnected from from the first
[1:28:41] resurrection or the the resurrection of
[1:28:43] Jesus Christ because he did he did so so
[1:28:46] that he can become the first fruit. The
[1:28:48] prophet says this wonderful Easter
[1:28:50] morning Jesus was alive and among the
[1:28:53] people. What a type it is today. What a
[1:28:56] type it is today that being on the
[1:28:58] Easter again Jesus is risen from the
[1:29:00] dead. And as he went about, many of his
[1:29:03] dear people, people who loved him,
[1:29:05] people who believed in him, they didn't
[1:29:07] know that he was alive. And so is he
[1:29:10] today. There's many good, honestarted
[1:29:14] Christian people who doesn't realize
[1:29:16] that Jesus Christ is alive and among us
[1:29:19] today. They fail to recognize that. They
[1:29:21] believe, oh, he died for my sins. They
[1:29:24] accept that he rose again and he's up in
[1:29:27] heaven somewhere, but he isn't. The
[1:29:29] prophet says in the resurrection of
[1:29:31] Jesus, but isn't is right here on earth
[1:29:34] in the form of the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; I will be with you to the end of the
[1:29:38] world. Not I'll be up in heaven looking
[1:29:41] down at you. I will be with you. Amen.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Prophet says one place said I will be in
[1:29:47] you to the end of the world.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; He will be he I he will be with us even
[1:29:53] in us to the end of the world. He says I
[1:29:56] not someone else. I I will be to the end
[1:29:59] of the world. I is a personal pronoun
[1:30:02] and I will be with you to the end of the
[1:30:04] world. Amen. So we need to have that
[1:30:07] experience of God is with me but not
[1:30:10] only with me, God is in me. Amen.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:17] As Jesus says in 14 John 14:19, "Yet a
[1:30:20] little while and the world see me no
[1:30:22] more, but ye see me because I live, you
[1:30:25] shall live also." That's why we sing
[1:30:27] that song. Because he lives, I can face
[1:30:30] tomorrow because he lives with me. Jesus
[1:30:33] Christ was a wave shift. Amen. Showing
[1:30:36] that there are more in the field that
[1:30:37] must come to the same maturity. If the
[1:30:40] same spirit that raised Christ from the
[1:30:42] dead dwells in you, it shall quicken
[1:30:44] also your mortal bodies. the spirit that
[1:30:46] dwells in you. Colosians likes to put
[1:30:49] emphasis on that. Colossians 1:18 says,
[1:30:51] "He is the head of the body, the church
[1:30:54] who is the beginning, the first born
[1:30:56] from the dead, that in all things you
[1:30:58] might have the preeminence."
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Paul here is pointing the first rise
[1:31:03] from the dead in a glorified eternal
[1:31:05] body, leading the way of who will be
[1:31:07] resurrected through him. Revelations 15
[1:31:10] from Jesus Christ who is faithful
[1:31:12] witness the first begotten of the dead
[1:31:15] the prince of the of the earth as we
[1:31:17] read at the beginning. Amen.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Amen with me. So here that we are living
[1:31:22] the time we are living. I believe we
[1:31:25] have the same evidence that Paul had.
[1:31:29] Yeah,
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Paul Paul did not was not in the time of
[1:31:33] Jesus Christ when when he was on earth,
[1:31:35] but he had the proof of his
[1:31:37] resurrection.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; He had the affirmation and the evidence
[1:31:41] of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[1:31:43] First of all, he saw the pillar of fire
[1:31:45] and the pill of fire talked to him says,
[1:31:47] "I'm Jesus Christ that you are
[1:31:49] persecuting." Paul recognized that that
[1:31:51] pill of fire can only be God. He knew it
[1:31:54] can only be God and it was the Lord
[1:31:56] Jesus Christ. So through that Paul
[1:31:58] recognized and saw that the same God of
[1:32:01] the Old Testament is Jesus Christ in the
[1:32:03] New Testament. Jehovah the Old Testament
[1:32:05] is Jesus Christ in the New Testament.
[1:32:07] But also he had the proof that Jesus who
[1:32:10] died is Jesus who rose from the dead
[1:32:13] because he could speak to me. He's
[1:32:15] alive. He's real. Amen. He had that
[1:32:18] evidence. No one could tell him out. No
[1:32:20] one could take him out of that evidence
[1:32:22] that Jesus Christ is alive because he
[1:32:24] saw the pillow fire.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Do you remember the story when someone
[1:32:29] challenged an evangelist somewhere I
[1:32:31] think in India or somewhere maybe maybe
[1:32:33] state I need to read the story again
[1:32:35] just to refresh my memory but he
[1:32:37] challenged that evangelist or that
[1:32:39] preacher say you know how what can
[1:32:42] difference can you make between Mad Mo
[1:32:46] and and Jesus? You believe in Jesus
[1:32:48] Christ,
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; what difference can you me give you give
[1:32:52] me?
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; I usually give that challenge to my wife
[1:32:54] sometimes.
[1:32:56] What proof do you have that Jesus Christ
[1:32:58] is alive?
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; If I'm if I if I if I if I'm Mohamad,
[1:33:02] what what can you give me as a proof? I
[1:33:04] say, okay, no, he's risen from the dead,
[1:33:06] you know, and he gave that he's risen
[1:33:08] from the dead and and and he's alive. I
[1:33:12] Muhammad can say, no, Muhammad is alive,
[1:33:14] too. And what what what can you say then
[1:33:18] you know uh then he went there another
[1:33:20] proof say no you know what but um but he
[1:33:23] he's in my soul so oh Mohammed is in my
[1:33:26] soul too so what proof what's the
[1:33:29] difference and then he says but but he
[1:33:32] one part he means to say he says the
[1:33:34] life that Jesus had is the same life
[1:33:37] that we have here because he did not
[1:33:39] believe that the same thing that Jesus
[1:33:41] did he can do it and he didn't want to
[1:33:44] refer him to to the prophet to say you
[1:33:46] know what maybe I don't have the faith
[1:33:49] to do everything that Jesus Christ did
[1:33:52] but I know one who performed the same
[1:33:54] miracles that Jesus Christ did to prove
[1:33:57] that Jesus Christ is here and the
[1:34:00] prophet said that's where he missed amen
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; so it's not that you have to prove
[1:34:05] everything but you can refer and say you
[1:34:07] know what Jesus Christ is alive because
[1:34:11] first he has changed my life I used to
[1:34:14] do certain things the Life of Jesus
[1:34:15] Christ changed my life. You guys do
[1:34:18] things by law. You must not do them and
[1:34:20] not this. But when the priest is not
[1:34:22] there and then you do certain things. I
[1:34:24] had friends who were Muslim Muslims. Oh,
[1:34:26] they do worse things when it's not the
[1:34:28] time of Ramadan.
[1:34:31] You wonder, oh wow.
[1:34:34] So it's by law, but for me it's not by
[1:34:36] law. It's it comes from the inside. Is
[1:34:39] the life of Jesus Christ inside of me.
[1:34:42] but also is performing the same thing
[1:34:45] that he performed there. He's still
[1:34:46] healing the sick today. He's still
[1:34:48] changing the heart today. The se the
[1:34:51] signs that shall follow those who
[1:34:53] believe. So it's still the same
[1:34:54] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; And in addition to that, God has given
[1:35:00] me the pillar of fire.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; I have seen the pit of fire. God Jesus
[1:35:05] Christ is raised from the dead. The same
[1:35:06] pit of fire that Paul saw. The same pit
[1:35:09] of fire we have seen. We have the
[1:35:11] evidence. We have the picture. The
[1:35:14] camera cannot take imaginations. Is the
[1:35:17] proof that he's risen from the dead. So
[1:35:19] God has privileged us to give us a
[1:35:22] better proof that he's risen from the
[1:35:24] dead. On top of that, brothers and
[1:35:27] sisters, he has given us the cloud that
[1:35:30] we can see his face there. Can you see
[1:35:33] his eyes? Can you see his nose? Can you
[1:35:35] see his beard? He's alive. Amen. So why
[1:35:39] are you looking for him in history only?
[1:35:42] He's here. Amen.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Don't look him only among the dead.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; But you put in our context. Sometimes we
[1:35:50] put things only for the time of Paul.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; It's good in time of Paul for the time
[1:35:57] of of the disciples or the apostles.
[1:35:59] It's good in time of the apostles. But
[1:36:01] it's not only the living for the past is
[1:36:05] the living today. Amen.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Glory to be the father. We put things
[1:36:09] only on brother Bham. Oh, we thank God.
[1:36:11] He was the wave shift to showing that
[1:36:13] he's the first one where the word of God
[1:36:16] has come to the maturity. But now each
[1:36:18] and every one of us, we should come to
[1:36:21] the same maturity. We should not look
[1:36:23] for God among the dead and we thank God
[1:36:26] for their lives but God what about me
[1:36:28] now?
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Become a reality to me now.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Change my heart. move me. Let me have a
[1:36:37] Easter view.
[1:36:39] As we're coming to a close, there's
[1:36:41] still more to say, but I think I put my
[1:36:42] thought. Amen.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Listen to this comment. Why seek ye the
[1:36:50] living among the dead? These questions
[1:36:53] also serve as a powerful and far, this
[1:36:55] is a comment, farreaching invitation for
[1:36:58] all believers to examine the foundation
[1:37:00] of their faith and the source of their
[1:37:02] hope. It urges them not to settle for
[1:37:05] lifeless traditions,
[1:37:08] superficial religious practices or
[1:37:10] beliefs that may sound spiritual but
[1:37:13] ultimately they are empty and
[1:37:15] disconnected from the living reality of
[1:37:17] Christ. Instead, it should challenge the
[1:37:21] believers to seek true life vibrant,
[1:37:24] transformative, eternal in the person of
[1:37:27] Jesus Christ. Lord, give me that
[1:37:30] reality, the power of the resurrection
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; that you are real today. It's a call to
[1:37:37] turn away from the allure of worldly
[1:37:39] distractions and fleeting pleasures and
[1:37:42] to anchor the heart in the risen savior.
[1:37:45] In doing so, believers are encouraged to
[1:37:47] live in the fullness of his presence,
[1:37:50] daily walking with him, drawing strength
[1:37:52] from his resurrection and holding fast
[1:37:55] the unshakable promise of eternal life
[1:37:58] that comes through genuine faith and the
[1:38:00] Holy Spirit that God has given us.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:05] Many people today don't realize that the
[1:38:08] brother banham says now only those who
[1:38:11] have their names written on the lamb's
[1:38:12] book of life and those who have been
[1:38:14] born again by the holy spirit is a
[1:38:16] witness of the resurrection.
[1:38:19] How can you be a witness? Means you you
[1:38:21] have a reality. You have seen or you
[1:38:24] have heard or you have experienced it
[1:38:26] then you can become a witness. Otherwise
[1:38:29] you just heard from someone and no you
[1:38:31] can't you can't you can't be a true
[1:38:34] witness in for for a judgment or for
[1:38:36] something to give really a proof if you
[1:38:38] haven't if you just heard it from oh I
[1:38:40] heard someone say that the prophet
[1:38:42] picked on that and says the Bible says
[1:38:44] no man can say Jesus is the Christ only
[1:38:47] by the Holy Ghost. You might know it by
[1:38:49] the way of word. You might know it by
[1:38:52] the way of the pastor or by your mother,
[1:38:55] by some testimony, but you don't know it
[1:38:59] yourself until personally he has
[1:39:01] witnessed to you that he's raised from
[1:39:04] the dead and lives in your heart.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:39:13] That's why
[1:39:15] as Christian who believe this Bible can
[1:39:18] prove that what we are talking about
[1:39:19] Christian who believe this Bible can
[1:39:21] prove what they are talking about that
[1:39:23] what makes as I said a while ago the
[1:39:26] salt of the earth that's right the world
[1:39:28] is looking for that salt when we can
[1:39:31] prove by our lives and by the bible that
[1:39:34] our lives are vindicated that the word
[1:39:37] to be believing today that's the day We
[1:39:40] are looking for how many desire that God
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; I want your life to be manifested in my
[1:39:47] life. I want that resurrection power to
[1:39:51] come into my life. The brother prayed at
[1:39:52] the beginning. I want the reality of
[1:39:54] Christ to become in my life. I want what
[1:39:58] the message is talking about to become
[1:40:00] in my life. Amen. The same thing as of
[1:40:03] the message. The message the message
[1:40:05] that sometimes we we may might look the
[1:40:06] message in the wrong way say no the
[1:40:08] message you know how you look like you
[1:40:10] you you're different from other churches
[1:40:13] and how the different we don't want to
[1:40:15] be different from other churches we just
[1:40:17] want the power of the resurrection to
[1:40:19] become a reality we want the the the
[1:40:22] same seed that went into into the ground
[1:40:24] the same thing that come to the maturity
[1:40:27] become manifest in our life we want to
[1:40:30] believe the whole word of God we want to
[1:40:31] believe the whole Bible the friends with
[1:40:33] other churches. We believe the whole
[1:40:35] Bible. Amen. We have only one book is
[1:40:37] the Bible. We only one law is the love
[1:40:40] of God. Amen. And we want the life of
[1:40:42] Jesus Christ to become a reality in our
[1:40:45] heart. Amen.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Because God has promised us that the
[1:40:49] same Holy Ghost that is in you is the
[1:40:52] same Holy Ghost that was in the time of
[1:40:54] the Lutans, the same Holy Ghost that was
[1:40:56] in the time of the Pentecostals, the
[1:40:58] same Holy Ghost that was in the time of
[1:40:59] the Pentecostals. But now he comes to
[1:41:02] continue his work beyond that. The Holy
[1:41:05] Ghost comes to go far beyond the
[1:41:08] Lutheran, the Methodist and the
[1:41:09] Pentecostal. The Holy Ghost comes to
[1:41:12] place us into adoption and into a
[1:41:15] position of the rapture to put us in the
[1:41:18] rapturing conditions. Amen. That's where
[1:41:20] we desire to be God. I want I want the
[1:41:23] Holy Spirit to bring me into the
[1:41:25] rapturing condition to give me perfect
[1:41:27] faith in your word. We have received the
[1:41:29] perfect word to bring perfect faith.
[1:41:32] Amen. And the the word of luther could
[1:41:35] not bring to perfect faith because it
[1:41:37] was not the perfect word. It was good
[1:41:39] but was not at the perfection. Methodist
[1:41:42] was good but was not at the perfection.
[1:41:44] Pentecostal it was good but it was not
[1:41:45] at the perfection. But God has restored
[1:41:48] the whole word. Restore word for
[1:41:51] fellowship. Restore the whole world to
[1:41:53] bring us to perfection. Amen. Only
[1:41:56] perfect word can bring perfect bride.
[1:41:59] Amen.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; The prophet says in why the holy ghost
[1:42:05] is given says the same holy ghost that
[1:42:08] saved the luttoran that sanctify the
[1:42:09] pentist that bapt baptize the
[1:42:12] pentecostals is now setting in order the
[1:42:15] coming of the lord Jesus Christ. It will
[1:42:18] be so powerful that body will come into
[1:42:22] this group, a church that will draw the
[1:42:24] rest of them from the grave. It will be
[1:42:27] a resurrection. That's what the Holy
[1:42:29] Ghost is for. What is the Holy Ghost
[1:42:31] for? Without us, they cannot be made
[1:42:33] perfect. They lived one day under that.
[1:42:36] We live in another day. When the enemy
[1:42:38] comes like a flood, the spirit of God
[1:42:41] would raise a standard against it. And
[1:42:43] we are in that day. Amen. We are in a
[1:42:45] day now. Amen.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord?
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; We thank God for his death. We thank God
[1:42:50] for his resurrection.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; We have now the benefit of his death. We
[1:42:55] have the benefit of his burial. We have
[1:42:57] also the benefit of his resurrection.
[1:42:59] Amen. The benefit all the benefit we
[1:43:01] have now when we are born again. When
[1:43:04] you have the Holy Spirit inside of you,
[1:43:06] you are born again. You have a personal
[1:43:08] re revelation. You have a personal
[1:43:11] resurrection. You were once dead. We
[1:43:13] were once dead. But now we are raised
[1:43:15] from the dead. As Ephesians 2:1 says as
[1:43:18] I'm closing, who who hath he quickened
[1:43:21] who were dead in trespasses and sins?
[1:43:24] wherein in time past you walked
[1:43:26] according to the course of the world,
[1:43:28] according to the prince of the power of
[1:43:29] the air, the spirit that now workketh in
[1:43:31] the children of disobedience, among whom
[1:43:34] also we all had our conversation in time
[1:43:38] past in the last of our flesh,
[1:43:41] fulfilling the desire of the flesh and
[1:43:43] of the mind. Oh, don't be at that stage.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Where you're still fighting because you
[1:43:49] are not born for that.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; You are not ordained for that. You are
[1:43:52] suffering actually more in being that
[1:43:54] state. Amen. Oh may God. But we were
[1:43:56] part in the lust of the flesh and
[1:43:58] fulfilling the desire of the flesh and
[1:44:00] of the mind and where by nature the
[1:44:02] children of the wrath even as adults.
[1:44:06] But even when we were dead in sins, God
[1:44:09] has quickened us together with Christ.
[1:44:11] By grace you are saved and he has raised
[1:44:14] us up together and made us sit together
[1:44:16] in heavenly places in Jesus Christ. that
[1:44:20] in the ages to come you might show the
[1:44:22] exceeding riches of his grace in his
[1:44:24] kindness towards us through Christ
[1:44:26] Jesus. For by grace are you saved
[1:44:29] through faith, not of ourselves. It is
[1:44:32] the gift of God.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Not of works lest any man should boast.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; So it's not us, oh I'm I'm better than
[1:44:40] others. No, it's God's grace my life for
[1:44:43] opening my eyes.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; For raising me from the dead
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; and giving the life of Christ. musicians
[1:44:49] can come.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; We thank God for his word. Amen.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; I wanted to sing a special in case you
[1:45:08] don't know it. But
[1:45:11] sometimes I think I know it and then I
[1:45:12] lose it. But
[1:45:14] [Music]
[1:45:16] Joseph, you know it, right? You think
[1:45:18] like I know it and then when you start
[1:45:20] singing it then oh I lost it. Uh but I
[1:45:24] would like to
[1:45:29] shall rise. Hallelujah. We shall rise.
[1:45:34] Do you know it? I will try to sing it.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Is anybody who knows it can help me. In
[1:45:45] the resurrection morning, with the
[1:45:49] trumpet of love, we shall rise.
[1:45:54] We shall rise
[1:45:57] and the saints will come rejoicing.
[1:46:01] No tears will ever be found. We shall
[1:46:04] rise. Hallelujah. We shall ride. We
[1:46:09] shall rise. We shall ride. Hallelujah.
[1:46:15] Amen. We shall rise. Hallelujah. In the
[1:46:20] resurrection morning when they
[1:46:25] thou broken, we shall rise. Hallelujah.
[1:46:29] We shall rise. I remember first time
[1:46:32] when I sung it and I had problems
[1:46:35] because I I'll try to sing it and see if
[1:46:38] it will work. And then um um
[1:46:44] in in the resurrection morning when a
[1:46:48] meeting it will be we shall rise.
[1:46:53] Hallelujah. We shall rise
[1:46:57] when our fathers and our mothers and our
[1:47:01] loved one we shall see. We shall rise.
[1:47:06] Hallelujah. We shall rise. We shall
[1:47:09] rise. We shall rise. Hallelujah. We
[1:47:14] shall rise. Amen. We shall rise.
[1:47:18] Hallelujah. In the resurrection
[1:47:22] morning when the prison bars are broken,
[1:47:26] we shall rise. Hallelujah. We shall rise
[1:47:33] in the resurrection

[1:59:24] tree.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; We just bow our head as the music is
[1:59:29] playing softly. You know this thought of
[1:59:33] [Music]
[1:59:34] sometime thinking like Jesus Christ is
[1:59:38] is still among the dead.
[1:59:41] John the Baptist, John the Revelator
[1:59:44] rather, the book of Revelation,
[1:59:47] Revelation 5,
[1:59:49] he was weeping
[1:59:51] because he see no one was found worthy.
[1:59:55] He didn't have the proper revelation
[1:59:58] of what the lamb of God was, what he has
[2:00:01] done. But thank God there was that elder
[2:00:05] who cried, "John, weep not, weep not."
[2:00:09] There's the lion of the tribe of Judah.
[2:00:12] The lamb of God has already prevailed
[2:00:15] and he had the revelation now. Oh, he
[2:00:17] already paid the price. So, he's worthy
[2:00:20] to take the book to break the seals
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; and to reveal the content within. No
[2:00:26] matter the situation where you might be
[2:00:28] maybe I've been weeping been, oh God,
[2:00:32] where are you in my situation? Where are
[2:00:33] you in my situation? My family, where
[2:00:36] are you in my situation for the
[2:00:38] sickness? Where are you in my situation
[2:00:40] for the financial needs? Where are you,
[2:00:42] Lord? Where are you, Father? Where are
[2:00:45] you? But I just want to remember to
[2:00:48] remind you this morning, he's not dead.
[2:00:51] He's risen from the dead.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; If he could save you by paying the price
[2:00:56] of him of himself, he's more than able
[2:00:59] to deliver you from the situation where
[2:01:01] you are in. Maybe it might be even a
[2:01:04] spiritual condition. Oh God, I I can't
[2:01:07] overcome this thing. I I feel bound.
[2:01:10] This thing seems to have a seal upon me.
[2:01:13] I feeling darkness. Oh God, where are
[2:01:16] you? Where are you? I feel perplexed,
[2:01:19] Lord. But I'm here to remind you, Jesus
[2:01:23] Christ is not among the dead.
[2:01:26] He's risen. He can deliver you from that
[2:01:29] situation you're in. He can break the
[2:01:32] seal for that situation and give you
[2:01:34] victory. And you might you will have a V
[2:01:38] day a V day for your day today.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; And that's what we desire to have. So
[2:01:43] let's just raise your hand to him and
[2:01:45] say Lord I love you and I want to have a
[2:01:48] Easter in my condition as well.
[2:01:52] Father Lord we thank you Lord this
[2:01:54] morning father as we look into what you
[2:01:58] have done for us 2,000 years ago. Father
[2:02:01] that you broke the seal of the Roman.
[2:02:04] Father Lord tried to put you in that
[2:02:06] condition so that the promise will not
[2:02:08] be fulfilled. But Father Lord the
[2:02:10] prophecy had to be fulfilled. You went
[2:02:13] to the grave and you said before you
[2:02:15] knew that before corruption set in you
[2:02:18] raised from the dead because your word
[2:02:21] can never fail. Father, the same spirit
[2:02:24] that raised you from the dead to confirm
[2:02:27] the word of God to fulfill the promise
[2:02:29] of God, that same Holy Spirit, Father,
[2:02:32] we welcome it this morning. We invite it
[2:02:34] in our lives, Father, for those who
[2:02:37] don't have a personal relationship with
[2:02:39] you, a closer walk with you, Father.
[2:02:41] Lord, the Holy Spirit come and break,
[2:02:43] Father, the chains of the enemy, breaks
[2:02:46] the feather, breaks the darkness, breaks
[2:02:48] the seal that's trying to bind them,
[2:02:50] Father, into darkness. Let the
[2:02:52] resurrection happen this morning father.
[2:02:55] Oh God that all of us Lord we can come
[2:02:58] to know you in a greater way to know you
[2:03:01] in the power of the resurrection Lord.
[2:03:03] Father we thank you for the resurrection
[2:03:05] that is happening in our lives. We thank
[2:03:07] you father to have changed our
[2:03:08] conditions. Lord you have changed and
[2:03:11] removed the darkness. You have removed
[2:03:13] father all the chains of laudicia.
[2:03:15] Father we were like that woman. Lord, we
[2:03:18] were dark in the world, but Father, you
[2:03:20] took us from our condition, from our
[2:03:22] thinking, and you have shown us, Father,
[2:03:24] the resurrection by the word of God, by
[2:03:27] the Holy Spirit, by the quickening
[2:03:28] power, Father. We thank you, Father, the
[2:03:30] resurrection that is happening in our
[2:03:32] days. Thank you, Lord. And we are
[2:03:34] looking forward for that great day or
[2:03:37] that morning, Father, when the last
[2:03:38] trump shall sound, Lord, when the dead
[2:03:41] will be risen
[2:03:43] and we shall see our loved ones, Lord.
[2:03:46] Father, you are the same yesterday,
[2:03:48] today, and forever. As we continue this
[2:03:51] journey in this earth, Father, help us
[2:03:53] to labor for you, to express our love
[2:03:55] towards you, to love you more. Father,
[2:03:58] God, change our weeping into joy, to
[2:04:01] rejoice in the promise of God. It's
[2:04:03] already done. It's a finished work.
[2:04:06] Father, no matter the circumstances, I
[2:04:08] just look out to Christ. He's risen. He
[2:04:11] will give me. He has already paid the
[2:04:14] price for my healing. Pray the price for
[2:04:16] the salvation. Pay the price for my
[2:04:18] family. Pay the price for my situations.
[2:04:21] Pay the price for my financial needs.
[2:04:23] Pay the price for my sickness. He's
[2:04:26] already paid. Father, pay the price even

[2:04:30] resurrection. Thank you, Father. Lord
