Summary of the Sermon:
Brother Moses Ndala’s sermon, “Patience Is the Steadfast Faith Under Pressure,” draws its foundation from 2 Peter 1:4–10, where believers are urged to “add to faith virtue… and to virtue knowledge… and to knowledge temperance… and to temperance patience.” He emphasizes that patience is not passive waiting, but a **steadfast, unwavering faith** that endures the pressures of time, trials, and delay. Brother Moses introduces patience as “the external manifestation of faith,” explaining that faith without patience remains immature. Drawing from the teachings of Brother Branham’s *“Stature of a Perfect Man,”* he reminds the congregation that God builds His church using the “real material” of patience—without which He cannot bring believers to full maturity.

Throughout the message, Brother Moses compares biblical examples of endurance—**Abraham**, **Noah**, and **Job**—to the believer’s walk today. Abraham waited twenty-five years for the promise of Isaac, yet “staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief.” Noah preached for 120 years without seeing rain, while Job suffered extreme loss yet remained faithful. The preacher ties these examples to the trials of modern believers, who often lose heart when answers do not come quickly. Referencing Brother Branham’s sermon *“The Trial,”* he illustrates how Satan uses *time* as a weapon to weaken faith, turning impatience into unbelief. But true patience, he says, keeps one fortified behind the Word—trusting that God’s promises will manifest in His perfect time.

Brother Moses teaches that God uses **time** intentionally to shape character. Just as a seed must remain buried before it sprouts, believers must remain steadfast under testing, watering their faith through praise and confession. He reminds that “the word is a seed,” and uprooting it by doubt only delays its fruitfulness. Echoing Branham, he notes that if God answered prayers instantly, ...

Uh first of all I going to stop here. Uh so this process had been for years and there is a first step that God touched me even when I have not seen my physical healing. It was like four three years ago when I went a special meeting and end time. So I want to mention this because it's a a miracles way that God start to show me what he going to do. Uh, I was h I was in a special meeting and I think brother Roger Spencer was preaching and I was in the upper room and h there was a a sister with a small H gear beside me and I start to praise the Lord. And when when brother Spencer uh was in a very special moment and the Holy Spirit was moving so I feel h something touched me this part of my body like a hand and I I didn't open my h my eyes and I thought that was the the gear that was beside me that was touching me. Then after that I feel like something came to me like a small lime and hit me like lime and with burn. Then well I said something is is happening. But when I open my eyes I realized that the gear was not there anymore was a another another place. So I said it she cannot touch me was something that will happen and even when I I I feel and I had give that testimony to other brothers that was praying and know my situation then years h came everything happened but no realize that that my my healing is is coming right so I keep struggling and struggling. Then I went to to the doctors during co COVID time was worse worse worse. The worst time was there when I went to the hospital and and well I keep doing because it had many areas of my life my my job and has been struggling with that. So I keep going keep going. But when h sometimes here brother Moses sometimes said if somebody sick here raise your hand and I keep claiming claiming receiving &gt;&gt; h now a couple weeks ago to get shorter this testimony I spoke with theologist and she said there is a high probability that you won't going to go to the surgery &gt;&gt; so I expecting h to do another exam of their test h she going to send me to the hospital and that test going to give the final result if I going to go to the surgery and I claiming to go please don't let me go to that surgery because it's six weeks six weeks and I not preparing for that in any way so Lord please touch me and I just confess my healing and said to my body I forcing to my body said accept I accept my healing h forced my body to obey. Uh and then I said to the urologist a couple weeks ago, a couple days ago, I had to go to the body shop to to change my tires h the car and I have to leave the tires by myself and when I leave is when I get worse. So I leave all the all the tires to the car and nothing happened. So I said thank you Lord. I report to the orologist and I waiting for for the complete healing.

When you see your face and Oh, that's good to see you. Amen. Brother Shai, God bless you and your family. God bless you. Amen. and uh met your brother Yahweh is always faithful. God bless you old friend from business and uh he said I I took this church as my church. So Oh, thank God. &gt;&gt; I'm glad I did that business. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I got a I got a colleague along the way. &gt;&gt; Thank God. Praise be to God. And we have a dedication this morning. I'll invite you to sit for a moment as just have a baby dedication to you know that song bring them in. [Music] &gt;&gt; Bring them in. &gt;&gt; Bring them in from the views of sea. Oh, bring them in. Bring them in. Bring the new ones to Jesus. &gt;&gt; So, we're going to dedicate this morning our baby boy, Jetro Lumumba. He's um he's uh he has good names there for those who don't know Lumumba and I think he's part of the family right lumumba is a the family been ask questions and but it's a good name in Congo Lumumba is related to a hero so but Jetro Jro is a is a is a father-in-law to Moses and And the pastor is Moses. So I'm happy that you're connected somewhere. Thank God. But he gave good advice to Moses. He told him, you know, it's not good that you everything is upon you. You need to divide the work and then God can use and God came and backed up that that advice. and you he kept Moses wife and he preserved him and then and the children and when they came out of Egypt he went and brought them back to Moses. So very good very good testament for him and the pregnancy u apparently was not was know the sister half not not apparently but the sister half was up and down up and down but in the midst of all that God kept her and kept the child. So we have a miracle child that we have here. &gt;&gt; God's grace manifesting in his life. So we want to commit him his life. Welcome Jetro. And uh we want to commit him to God and pray to him. Just want to read a scripture from the Bible. Mark 10:13 16. We appreciate brother Gabriel and sister Sharon. And uh we love them and thank God for for their life and the testimony. appreciate them and the is the last boy of is joining other three already there but I was telling them it's good they have two two two boys two girls what's a good split the next one that will come it will be a they have to be twins one girl one boy I told them you know it's good we have one church member without me testifying to him. He just just added to the church. That's good. So Mark 10:13 just read it from the Bible. I written my note there. Just leave it for the Bible. So we don't baptize children. uh denominations and churches they baptize children but it's not according to scripture because before being baptized you have to repent and recognize your sins but the children as he come there is innocent has no sin of his own to repent of so we just want could commit to the lord Jesus Christ as the bible has declared so 10316 16 bear with me for a few moment as we think it also important as God Jesus Christ took time to bless a child. They take a few times for that as well. So Mark 10:13 says and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciple rebuked those who brought them. But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased and said unto them, "Suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of God." So we should be like children, little children. Amen. If we are like children, they just have genuine faith. They believe everything that God that that that the parents say just take it the way the parents says that how we should also have attitude towards God just believe everything as he's there is the father is holding him is completely depending on the father &gt;&gt; that how we should be depending completely on god and god's word amen verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child he shall not enter therein in and he took them up in his arms and put his hands upon them and he blessed them. So he didn't baptize them, he blessed them. The enemy is not happy but we are going to surround him with the angel of the Lord who was waiting when the mother gave birth. We want that same angel of the Lord to keep watching over him all his life. Amen. going to invite elders and uh and pastor Z is a crying one or &gt;&gt; Let's pray together. Father Lord Jesus Christ, we thank you for your grace and your mercy. Father Lord Jesus &gt;&gt; for what you have done Lord in this family as you have blessed them. &gt;&gt; First you have kept a sister Lord during this time of pregnancy. &gt;&gt; It was not an easy one father. She was getting sick and different things father but you watched over them. &gt;&gt; The same God who watched over them father we want to say thank you. We praise your name.

Father, bless the family, oh God, as you have provided. Continue to lead them, provide them financially, spiritually, create the atmosphere, Father, Lord, so that this child can be raised in admonition and fear of the Lord, Father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord, we commit him to you from my hands to your hands, Father. That you, Father, be the one, Lord, sustaining him and watching over him and blessing him as we pray like this in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; I'm happy to hold a child. I feel like holding one &gt;&gt; more. &gt;&gt; Took over my job. &gt;&gt; You can still hold him.

God is really life. And Thank God for that. And amen. Let's go to the word of God and be um thank you for your patience and let you go to Second Peter chapter one as we continue on our study on the statue of a perfect man. Second Peter chapter 1. 2 Peter chapter 1 verse 4. and whereby I given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, for by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godliness, and to godliness, brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness charity. And if these things be in you and abound, so they have, they are there, but they have to abound. Let them abound. They make you that you shall neither be barren or nor untruthful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But he that lackth these things is blind and cannot see a far off and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. Therefore rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure. For if you do these things, you shall never fall. Amen. May God bless you. Let us have a word of prayer for God to open to us. Father Lord, we have read your word. Father Lord, we are going to the solemn part of the service. Lord, we pray God as our heart has been prepared. Thank you for the worship, Lord. Thank you for the gift, the body of Christ. Thank you, Father, Lord, for the dedication of the of Jetro. Father, we thank you, Father, for for the healing among us, for the touch. Lord, we want just to surrender ourself once more, Father, to hear few words, Lord. But the word of God is life. &gt;&gt; That's where there is life, Father. And we are just want to grasp it in our heart. Open our hearts, Father, to receive it, Lord, as a child, as we heard, just to receive everything what you have in store for us and to keep walking with you. We love you, Lord. We appreciate you. Put the man aside, either the speaker, both the speaker and the hearers. Put all of us aside. May the Holy Spirit speak and let the Holy Spirit hear within us. Father in Jesus Christ name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can have your seat just brother Boris was greeted you yesterday or yesterday today the second. Yeah. Yesterday was his birthday. So I wished him birthday as he himself announced the last time as we're talking. So November the 1st. So I kind of kept that and my wife reminded me yesterday I sent him a message and he said greet the church again and thank you for your hospitality and how you welcomed him and just a blessing for him. Uh once again I always say this is a very easy church to preach. Always welcoming ministers. So God bless you for that. And friend who say minister thank you. God bless you for that &gt;&gt; for being your church uh the minister preaches just welcome the word of God. You have been you have that testimony. Every ministers come here testify that this church is very very welcoming word of God. God bless you for that. And um also uh in 10 days on the 12th, God willing, I'll be traveling to to India missionary work to see the work that dear and precious pastor Zeke and the church and his inspiration and the vision that he had and the work that has been doing over there. So it be good to go and and see and and uh and also grasp the reality of it so that we can uh can can see how we can continue to support them. So we want to salute pastor for for the work and the vision that he had. God bless him richly and uh so want to thank you for for your support in prayers but also support financially. So thank you for it's a thanks to your to your to your your gift to your offerings and tithes that we could buy the ticket and afford to go there. So God bless you richly and bless your work and and all that you are doing. Uh the Bible says in heaven you'll have a great reward if you can't go there but you can send someone to go somewhere and you will be sharing the same reward. So God bless you for that. just want to acknowledge what you are doing and thank you. Uh you know sometimes $1 here might not mean anything but $1 somewhere else can do a lot right so um it's good that pastor Zeke identified where the little effort that you can make can have a bigger impact so we want just to salute that and continue to work on that God leadership and God guidance. Amen. And um so God bless you for that. When I come I'll have maybe videos and things to share what you have been doing and how it has been helping. And God bless you for that. Amen. I'll go uh the next uh virtue. Uh I was hoping to finish all this uh before I go to to India but uh it's impossible. So I will come and finish that all that and we have visitors and things like and so it was just just let the god leads. I will touch a little bit today on patience and uh god willing on a comeback and godliness brotherly kindness looking forward to the capstone but uh just go one step at a time. Amen. Those things has to abound in us. Amen. So I would like to take as a title today, patience is the steadfast faith under pressure. Patience is the steadfast faith under pressure. Um long title but it try to make it simple. I'll try to make it simple. I won't be long. Try to make it simple. Patience is a steadfast faith under pressure. Steadfast is a not a words maybe you used to very often said. Oh I don't use very often. It means um is defined as is as dutifully, firm, unwavering, is loyal, faithful, committed, devoted, dedicated, dependable, reliable, steady, true, constant, staunch, trusty, firm, determined, resolute. You want me to keep going on? Impleable, single-minded and changing and wavering and hesitating and faltering and unswerving and yielding and fleeching and flexible and compromising and on and on and on. So that a very good word to be. I think it's very good to have patience and the way it is patience is you know we we we can have as I put the we can have we can have something all of a sudden you can have a little bit of a joy moment you have a little bit of a joy but keep that joy going that's where the problem is right you can have you can have you can have a lot of things you can have a little bit of peace oh everything is fine you as the sister s when everything is going fine oh yeah I have peace this and everything is fine. I feel like I have faith everything is fine. But when keep that keeping is the hardest things you know in the sport there there was just comes to my mind now I think um I think one of the good good players in the past our generation were younger I think it was Michael Jordan whatever it was younger that was how looking so he was saying one one of them said I don't remember who said but he said you know um being the first or the best player of the year is good it's good to be a best player it's wonderful everybody clean but keeping that for the next year next year next year &gt;&gt; that's the hardest thing &gt;&gt; reaching is always okay everybody likes but keeping it that's where it's hard &gt;&gt; and that's the same thing I think in a Christian life &gt;&gt; oh it's good but are you patient enough to keep it that's the problem &gt;&gt; praise be to God so from that that what we have read here it says from what we read in the in the Bible in second Peter's And that word comes from the Greek word. It says it says it says it patience, enduring, patience, continuence, patience. It say steadfastness, consistency, endurance. In the Old Testament, it say the characteristic of a man who is not served from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to faith and pe and piety by even the greatest trials and suffering. Patiently and steadfastly. patient, steadfast waiting, patient enduring, sustaining perseverance. So this morning I want to show the example of the Bible that patience is the external manifestation of faith. Amen. People can have faith but if it's not accompanied by patience, I believe it's still immature faith because that faith needs to grow to get to the level of stature of a perfect man. And if you don't have patience, then that faith is not mature enough. Amen. The Bible says or the prophet says in the statue of a perfect man said. Then after that fourthly you want to add patience to your faith. If you got faith it workketh of patience. The Bible said and see. So so this is patience and that is the next thing is going to build this teacher. You know God has got real material in this building. God has real material in this building. And one of them is patience. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; And it says how short we are brothers and sisters. See why? Where are where we at? Yes sir. We have glory. We have shouts and things because we got faith. But when come down to those things here, God can't build us onto that stature. See, he can't. He can't make us up to that kind of a place. We got all these other things. We fall and slide off with it. See, he can't build his church. In other words, he can't build his church without patience. Patience with what? What kind of patience? First thing is had patience is had patience with God. If you've got real genuine faith, you've you'll already have genuine patience because faith workketh patience. When God says anything, you believe it. That's it. You got patience. Well, I asked him last night to heal me and I'm just as sick this morning. Oh my, what patience himself say? God told Abraham 25 years later there wasn't even one sign. He was still believing. He was patient with God. &gt;&gt; So put him always before you. Let him be the next let him be the let him be the next crossing things. You can't cross him. Just keep him before you. He said so and it's going to happen. Keep him before you. That right. &gt;&gt; And then it goes on. It takes Noah had patience. Noah had really real godly patience. God said, "I'm going to destroy this world with rain." And Noah preached 120 years yet plenty of patience. Not even Jew fell from heaven. Wasn't nothing. just as dusty as it ever was for 120 years. But he was patience. He was patient. Then God tries your patience. The prophet says God tries your patience. That's right. God tries them. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe that patience deals with the actual element that God put us in because patience comes to our level. Amen. You know it patience come to I like what brother actually brother Boris preached already this message I would say on Saturday when he preached here it was actually this message of patience so I'll just repeat some of the things but God put us patience touches the element of where we are in &gt;&gt; it is time patience time touch the element of time &gt;&gt; as long as there is no time things will be so easy because you'll get it instantaneously you all the anything or you see developing anything anything you see the developing and you get it right away that's that but when the time element comes in that's where the problem comes but God as brother brother Boris put it so well God himself that was God intention to put the element of time we come from eternity we go into the element of time and then we go back to eternity everything is fine when it was eternity &gt;&gt; no one complains all shouting and everything of joy that way of everything's fine. After time everything will be fine. No complaining. It will be eternal joy. There is no tomorrow. Everything is now. Everything is now. Everything is perfect between those two things. But in the middle there that were time and that were problem. But it was God INTENTION TO PUT TIME. Time so that why put time there? So that we can be tested. We bypassed our theophony in order to be tested. God put us in time for that. But we have to recognize the same God of eternity is the same God during the time. It will be the same God after time. That's why he put IS THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGA. &gt;&gt; GOD IS NOT BOUND BY TIME. AMEN. WE ARE LIMITED BY THE TIME and that's where the problem is. The prophet will say even further. says you know there is where sight and time is God worst's enemy in divine healing you know the worst enemy in our Christian walk is ourself &gt;&gt; but I believe in and God promises one of the greatest enemy is time &gt;&gt; because we want to put time on things on I want it to be happening so quick I want it to be happening now I want it happening tomorrow if if it's not tomorrow AND THEN YOU PUT DEADLINE TO GOD WHEN YOU PUT DEADLINE TO GOD that's where There is a problem &gt;&gt; and the enemy want to come upon TIME TO USE TO WHEN HE'S THROWING US IS COMING UPON time you know you know God promised you this why why is it not happening why you don't see a change why you don't see that so he's REMINDING YOU ABOUT THE TIME BECAUSE THAT the only time he has to work on AFTER THIS TIME HE CAN'T WORK ON BUT may God give us patience &gt;&gt; just wait upon the Lord just wait upon God's promises those who wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. &gt;&gt; Just wait upon the Lord. HE KNOWS THE RIGHT TIME. HE KNOWS WHEN HE'S GOING TO FULFILL HIS WORD. GOD IS IN CONTROL OF EVERY SITUATION. He's the God of the mountain. He's the God of the valley. He's the God OF ETERNITY. HE KNOWS EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; AND JUST TO recognize that and I want to put that emphasis so much this morning to this morning, I want you to recognize today if you are standing, you are an overcomer. As brother Maurice put so well. Let me put the reminder to you. Today if you are standing you ARE AN OVERCOMER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE FACT THAT YOU ARE STILL GETTING HOLDING ON GOD PROMISE EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T SEE IT HAPPENING YET YOU ARE AN OVERCOMER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; So you HAVE TO SAY BOO TO THE DEVIL. DEVIL I DON'T SEE IT YET BUT I'M STILL STANDING ON GOD promise &gt;&gt; because I'm waiting PATIENTLY ON GOD'S promise &gt;&gt; to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; The message the trial message is wonderful message. The prophet has preached many times. In the trial message there is a case again against God. Satan is not using is not using bad bad people like worldly people to present in the case. You know there is a he put it a case. So there is a a prosecutor attorney you call it is the one who bring the charge is the Satan and then Satan is bringing his witnesses and then God has to come and also bring his witnesses on the other side. So the witnesses that Satan is bringing to the case that God's word is not true. Look at those three types of witnesses that he's taking. The prophet says you understand it's a case against God that he will bring three people. Mr. Unbelief and Mr. Skeptic. Those are easy to identify &gt;&gt; because as a Christian is easy to identify. Oh, he's just Mr. Unbelief. He doesn't even believe God. So what whatever God says and I say no I don't believe God and I don't believe in that. No no no why are you taking you argue and you just classify him. So this is an unbeliever. There's no let just wait until God touch his heart otherwise you can't try to convince him because it has to go there. Amen. You take another skeptic. The other one is a skeptic is one who believes partially. is kind of sometimes I'm skeptical but I can give it a try and let's see how it can work. Yeah. Are you with me? Just just let me take those examples. An unbeliever. The prophet says they call first one of the witness says Mr. unbeliever. He complains this all of God's promises word is not true. So he's rejecting everything. Now he's going to be tried for this. Listen. says he claims Mark 16 was ministering to me in so-called Holy Ghost meeting where others claimed to be getting healed and that was ministering to me two years ago and there is no difference in me yet this science does not follow the believer he said he made this claim against him said I I just there I don't believe it because this was to me and that's it I reject it the skeptic he takes the scripture of God's words of James 5:16 he says it was in place where they claimed that held were called and he was anointed with oil and prayed over that was over a month and there's been no change in in him yet. So he knows that that's wrong. He's calling God and indicting God for it. Now the third one is Mr. Impatient &gt;&gt; and the prophet says he's the cruel one &gt;&gt; because Mr. Impatient can be for a moment a believer. &gt;&gt; For a moment Mr. Impatient is a believer. He says God says this or I believe what God says. He can even say hallelujah. Praise be to God. Hallelujah. PRAISE BE I ACCEPT IT. I BELIEVE IT. In the in the prayer meeting we have brother say you can have a prostitute comes and she has faith. She has a burst of faith and she believes and she's healed constantly and she goes back. She's healed more than the sometimes the believer is there because the believer knows the word of God say oh that I made a mistake there. I made a mistake there. I don't qualify for healing. And he's, you know, he's putting himself down and he's rejecting God's promise because he's condemning himself, not believing in what the word of God is saying, if you repent, all your sins are forgiven. &gt;&gt; But the other one who comes and he just believe that God is the healer. Accept and he's healed. And I say, "Oh, but how come I didn't get it?" And because you didn't grasp the promise for you, you need to grab the promise. But the one who got healed and go back doesn't stay Christian. There's a you can believe but you have to stay a believer. That's where the problem is. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in Mark 11:12 the prophet says so he says in the trial message the next witness is Mr. Impatient. He's a noful guy. All right. Mr. Impatient. He claims that he read out God's word in Mark 11:12 and 13. that when if you prayed, if you believe that what you have prayed, you receive, you shall have what you asked for. And he say that he asked to lay down his crutches after he read the word and asked God to heal them and he asked to lay down its crutches and that that's been five years ago. He's never been able to lay them down since. So they claim God is not justified in putting such rash promises in his word. Now do you understand the case now against God prophecy? is not justified in doing that placing such scriptures Mark 113 2223 Mark 16 James 5:14 and such promises that they're inducting God because of a breach of promise he has broken his promise he's not able to stand by they're inducting him for putting such in his word then the prophet says as a message say God will take also another the one who's going to defend himself he's going to take the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is going to come and he's going going to defend himself. The Holy Ghost is going to call upon his own witnesses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says God fortify his children behind his word. And the very first thing you step from behind it, you are target to the devil. He can't get you as long as you are fortified by the word. The promise I want you your attention. Now, this is the defense witness, the Holy Ghost. The promise is only to believers, not make believers, not skeptics, not unbelievers. &gt;&gt; So the promise of God only applies to those who believe. &gt;&gt; If you don't believe, YOU CAN'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THE WORD OF GOD. BUT IF YOU STAND BEHIND THE WORD OF GOD, YOU ARE FORTIFIED BY THE WORD OF GOD. SO STAND ALL THE TIME BEHIND THE WORD OF GOD. THAT'S YOUR STRENGTH. AMEN. THE PROMISE IS ONLY TO THE BELIEVERS, NOT TO OTHERS. Now this is the defense witness. The defense witness should know because he is the one that quickens it to them and he knows whether it is true or not. Says if you want he also want to call the attention here being the quickener of the word he also calls the attention the word is a seed. The word is a seed. &gt;&gt; The word when the when you receive the word of God I like that interpretation. The word is the seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word is the seed. It's wonderful because okay, I wanted to put this comment before I go there, but I will go there. The prophet says the word never said when he said he would. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "I will give you a child to to Abraham's son by Sarah next month." Not next month. He never said next month. He said he would. Not when. The prayer they shall lay hands on the sick. They shall recover. That's the idea. The prayer of faith shall save the sick and God shall raise him up. Terry in the city of Jerusalem until you endured with power on high. Not for one day, not two hours, not 10 days, not 10, not 10 years. says a real defense witness. This fellow I never said would have the baby would would have the baby. Abraham said he would have it all the time. The odds was bleeding against him. He stayed there because he didn't stagger an unbelief of God. He held on. What I want to put the emphasis here. It's when the prophet says the problem is when we put a when &gt;&gt; God I want this promise or I'm relying on the promise promise until next year. If I'm not next year, then that's it. I leave. &gt;&gt; You You don't see those who have been the message for a long time, they knows it, right? &gt;&gt; You see a sister there that have been there been waiting for marriage. I've been waiting for marriage and waiting for marriage. One year, two years in her mind, she already put three years. If there's no three years, I go back to the world. &gt;&gt; After three years, she go back to the world &gt;&gt; because God didn't answer that in three years. Oh my dear sister. No, stay. Wait patiently. &gt;&gt; God knows. &gt;&gt; Don't break the word of God because of time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was not my note but just &gt;&gt; the problem comes when we put time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Just rely on God knows the right time. &gt;&gt; The enemy will work on time. We know he works on the flesh. Oh, and the other next enemy is the time. &gt;&gt; He will work on time space. If you don't get this job next month, you know, quit. You know that that thing God is not answering. He's not hearing. No, just stay there. Just commit him to the Lord and stay believing in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then you go to the seed. The word of God is a seed. &gt;&gt; Is a seed has to follow into the ground. When it follows into the ground, what you have to do is to water that ground all the time. God, I thank you for your promise. I thank you for your grace. I thank you for you healing me. I thank you FOR YOU GUIDING ME. I DON'T PUT ANY TIME AT GOD IN HIS OWN TIME THAT SEED IS GOING TO COME OUT AND PRODUCE THE FRUIT. AMEN. YOU DON'T DETERMINE THE SEED. YOU SEE IF YOU DON'T COME TOMORROW I'm going to take you out. You're not a seed. You're not a REAL SEED. NO, YOU ARE FAILING. AMEN. &gt;&gt; ANOTHER MESSAGE THE PROPHET says if you put a seed don't go each morning and AND TAKE IT OUT from the the soil AND LOOK IT. ARE YOU WORKING OR NOT WORKING? AND THEN PUT IT BACK AGAIN and tomorrow COME YOU TAKE IT OUT. ARE YOU I PUT IT YOU ARE YOU WORKING OR NOT WORKING? NO, YOU ARE YOU ARE WORKING AGAINST NATURE. YOU'RE WORKING AGAINST GOD'S WORD. PUT IT UNDER THE SOUL AND WATER WE GOD PROMISES. GOD I THANK YOU. GOD I PRAISE YOU. GOD I CONFESS YOUR WORD IS THE TRUTH. AS A SISTER CONFESS THIS BODY WILL BE OBEDIENT TO THE CONFESSION OF MY MOUTH BECAUSE THE WORD OF GOD IS TRUE WHEN TOMORROW I DON'T KNOW AFTER TOMORROW I DON'T KNOW LIKE ABRAHAM I KEEP BELIEVING GOD I KEEP PRAISING GOD I KEEP WORSHIPING GOD &gt;&gt; SARAH DO YOU FEEL ANYTHING I DON'T FEEL ANYTHING OH PRAISE BE TO GOD TOMORROW IT WILL BE A GREATER MIRACLE &gt;&gt; AND NEXT YEAR IT DOESN'T HAPPEN PRAISE BE TO GOD I KEEP BELIEVING GOD IT WILL BE A GREATER MIRACLE 25 YEARS PASSED. ABRAHAM, YOU SAID YOU ARE THE FATHER OF MANY NATIONS. WHERE IS THE SON? &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD. I WILL HAVE ONE. &gt;&gt; HOW COME? BECAUSE GOD SAID SO. &gt;&gt; I'M PATIENTLY WAITING. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WAITING UPON THE LORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; PUTTING THE SEED. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; But Mr. impatient says, God, I believed you, but the time is too long. One year is too much. Lord, I can't wait for one year. &gt;&gt; But God is not bound by time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Actually, time is testing us. &gt;&gt; That's why he put timeested memorials. Our Christian life is just time. &gt;&gt; Time is testing us. &gt;&gt; If you are good, oh, time will show up over here. like [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the word is a seed. So let's let's let's go let's go to to Matthew 23. Matthew 13. Thank you, sir. This is the parable of of the of of the ser. It says verse 18 says, "Hear he therefore the parable of the of the swer. When anyone heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth not, then cometh the wicked one and catches away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received the seed by the wayside. So pro Jesus Christ put there I think I can just put the interpretation of it. So you put by the so the different kind of different kind different different kind of soil different kind of ground different ground the seed is sowed into those ground by first one is by the wayside. So Jesus Christ himself is giving interpretation to the disciples. Everybody heard through parables but thank God he had a group of disciples who came and asked the Jesus Christ, can you give us the interpretation of those parables? And Jesus Christ says, you are special people. Verse 12, you are special people. Many prophets and righteous men have desired to hear those things and to see those things, but they've not seen them. And to hear those things which you hear have not heard them. But you, God has given you a special grace. The same thing for the message of the hour. Many people have heard, many people read the Bible, but they can't see, they can't see the revelation that you and I have because it is special people. Amen. Quality God can give you the revelation of the word of God. Now he says those who fell from the wayside, it's those those they receive, they heard the word of God in the kingdom and but they understood it not. Then the wicked one comes and takes it away. And he likes to do that. You know, you hear the word of God, you don't understand, you questioning the word of God, he comes, he take that the word of God away from you. And then the second one say, he that receive the seed in stony place is the same is the same that hears the word of God and and a non with joy receive it. He received the word of God, but he has no root in himself but endures for a while. Listen to this. For when tribulation and persecution ariseth because of the word of God, by and by he is offended. Says, "Oh, but I receive the word of God. I got baptized or I go to that church or I listen to the prophet, but when why why tribulation? Why persecution? Why these things are arising? Why I'm being persecuted at school? Why I'm being persecuted at home? Why things are happen becoming difficult?" And then you start putting the word of God and that word of God maybe doesn't apply to me. It still applies to you. It's the seed of God but it needs to find root in in yourself. Amen. It says he also that receive the seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word and the care of this world and the deceitful of riches choke the word and he becometh unfruitful. So he has received the word of God but because of the things and deceitful of the world and the care of this world it choke the word of God. Is it the fault of the word of God? No. &gt;&gt; The problem is the ground and how we are taking care of the ground &gt;&gt; and how we are letting the influence of the outside influence that seed and it choke the word of God and it BECOMES UNFRUITFUL. HERE'S THE WORD of God but not unfruitful. But he that receiveth seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word and understand it which also beareth fruit and bring forth some and 100folds some 60 some 30. I believe in this church are those who have received the word of God in the right ground &gt;&gt; IN THE RIGHT SOIL. AMEN. YOU MIGHT NOT PRODUCE 100 BUT YOU AS YOU ARE PRODUCING 30 GOD IS PRAISING YOU AND THANKING YOU. THANK YOU FOR STANDING ON THE WORD OF GOD. THANK YOU FOR BEING PATIENT ALL THESE YEARS THROUGH UPS AND DOWNS. THE FACT THAT YOU ARE HERE, YOU ARE AN OVERCOMER. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE FACT THAT YOU ARE HERE, THE SEED WENT IN THE RIGHT GROUND. AMEN. &gt;&gt; NO MATTER THE DIFFICULTY, NO MATTER THE DECEPTION OF THE WORLD, YOU KEEP standing on the word OF GOD. &gt;&gt; STAYING PATIENT WITH GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Because you are not a being of time only. &gt;&gt; People fail because they only focus on the time. They think okay my time on earth just live and be happy because that the only time I have. NO THE TIME IS YOU ARE NOT PART OF THE TIME. YOU ARE PART OF ETERNITY. &gt;&gt; LET YOUR DECISION BE MADE BECAUSE BASED ON THE ETERNITY NOT ON THE TIME. &gt;&gt; IF YOU MAKE YOUR DECISION BASED ON THE TIME YOU ARE BOUND TO FAIL BUT THANK GOD YOU ARE MAKING YOUR DECISIONS BASED ON ETERNITY FROM WHERE YOU COME FROM AND FROM WHERE YOU ARE GOING. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU STAY PATIENT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, that's the thought of the seed. And if the seed falls in the right, the prophet continued the trial. Fertile ground, it will produce exactly what God said it will do. But it fell in the right kind of ground. So there is not soil enough, faith enough to make the seed grow. I think as the one who quickened the seed, he ought to know. Don't you think so? How many believes that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Congregation says, "Amen." &gt;&gt; It should be the one who knows it. He's the real defense witness. Amen. Praise be to God. Although I had that fellow said the Holy Ghost will call Noah. I had that fellow on the witness stand here a while ago. Mr. Unbeliever is called me all the time. This Noah testifying. He made fun of me. I've seen Mr. Ceptic. He come around and he laughed at me. I've seen Mr. Impatient, all of them, they laughed at me for believing in such a miracle. But I waited. When I finished the ark, the rain never came. I waited for 120 years before it came. But it came. Amen. But finally, it came. Do you know what message Noah had? It's going to rain. &gt;&gt; It's going to rain &gt;&gt; every morning. IT'S GOING TO RAIN. &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD. IT'S GOING TO RAIN. &gt;&gt; THE FIRST WEEK they pay attention. So, huh? We have never heard this message. That's a difficult That's different message. Where rain? Where the rain is going to come?

After that, we have to switch on to something great, greater, bigger, and nicer. [Laughter] Oh, why did I make that mistake long [Laughter] but the rapture is coming is definitely coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People People get discouraged. They hear about the rapture and then they say, "No, it's not happening." thing they put aside and we have heard it and then they relax down and they cool down and they go back in the world and things are there people get married in the world people do the things they leave work they focus on on profession and everything and then oh let me become rich first and after that I will come oh go and build my career and everything when I'm full and everything I will come and there will be one generation they will go I will never come it will be the last one and the rapture will Oh, don't be the kind of that person who says, "No, I put it aside for some time. I will come back when things are all." You are playing the role of a Mr. impatient &gt;&gt; and you are going to be on the other side. I believed it, but I took a little bit long. I THOUGHT IT WILL BE HAPPENING the next week. We thought that will happen 2000. I believe that he was going to have 20,000. I EVEN TOLD MY FRIEND AT SCHOOL, you know, it's happening in 2000 year. If 2000 doesn't happen, you have to come and tell me that I'm a false prophet. I was a false prophet back then. I PUT THE TIME. DON'T PUT THE TIME. AMEN. JUST BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND KEEP MOVING ON. AMEN. &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I know we have to have a balance. Plant your potato. You But you plant your potatoes, but also you are you are also working as knowing that he can come tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Don't only plant your potatoes and you forgot about God. Amen. Some also don't that just be there and they forget the potatoes. You also need to plant the potatoes both ways. Amen. BUT MAKE SURE THAT AS YOU ARE PLANTING YOUR POTATO, YOU HAVE YOUR WEAPON WITH YOU. YOU ARE READY FOR ANY TIME. &gt;&gt; YOU LEAVE AS IS HAPPENING TODAY. AMEN. DON'T POSTPONE IT TO ANOTHER TIME. REPENT TODAY. AMEN. THIS IS YOUR DAY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Second Peter 3, Peter is saying it so well here. Beloved, be not ignorant this one thing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not stuck. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some man count slackness, but is long-suffering to ask word, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. &gt;&gt; But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in the which the he the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the element shall melt with fervent heat. the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up. Seeing that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Looking for and hasting in unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat. Nevertheless, we according to his promise look for new heavens and new earth dwelling wherein dwelleth righteousness. That's where we are looking. There will be a new heaven and new earth. That's where our promise is. We are looking for a new place. This is not our home. Amen. This is not our dwelling place. Our dwelling place is to be WITH THE LORD FOREVER. THAT WAS HIS DESIRE AND HE PUT THAT DESIRE INSIDE OF US. SO WE HAVE THE SAME DESIRE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; DON'T POSTPONE THINGS. Don't put on things for the for the future and leave your life. Your life has to BE FOR GOD. THAT TIME THAT GOD CREATED is for him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not for yourself. FOR HIM &gt;&gt; TO SERVE him in this portion of time. I like that portion that that I say there. I lost it. But I like that portion. It says, you know, he will come as a thief. God will come as a thief to people who are not expecting it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's how a thief comes. A thief come when you're not expecting it. You are well sleeping and sleeping and then the morning. Hey, what happened? &gt;&gt; Too late. &gt;&gt; Oh, I couldn't hear anything. They bewitched me. No, he used to say, "Oh, that thief be No, otherwise I could have heard it. He bewitched me. I couldn't see it. I couldn't hear anything." No, you were just sleeping. &gt;&gt; You're not expecting him to come. &gt;&gt; That's right. But if he warns you that I'm coming, no, no matter what what kind of bewitching he's got, you are waiting for him because he promised that I'm coming. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So he's going to come to a thief to those who are not waiting for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But thank God for he has given us a warning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are living in the end time, the end of the end time. &gt;&gt; He has given us signs to see and watch. And when you see those signs being fulfilled, know ye that the end is there. THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS NEAR. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE RECEIVED THE LAST MESSENGER. THAT'S THE SIGN FOR THE CHURCH. THAT THE SIGN TO THE BRIDE. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE RECEIVED OUR WARNING. SO GET READY TODAY. LET YOUR LAMP BE TRIMMED TODAY. BE WATCHFUL. AMEN. BECAUSE HE'S COMING. AMEN. IT'S ACTUALLY let me say the cycle of his coming is already here. &gt;&gt; THE WORD OF GOD HAS BEEN UNVEILED. OUR BRIDEGROOM. THE WORD OF GOD IS ALREADY HERE. SO WE ARE WALKING IN THAT TIME OF THE COMING OF THE LORD. IT'S NOT FOR A LONG TIME ANYMORE. EVEN IF IT IS 20 YEARS AGO, 20 YEARS IN THE FUTURE, IT'S STILL NOT LONG. 20 YEARS IS JUST NOTHING FOR GOD. AMEN. YOU STAY FAITHFUL. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT MIGHT BE YOUR DAY, MIGHT BE TODAY. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT can happen when you come out of this. It might be your hand. AMEN. WE DON'T KNOW. SO YOU BE READY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; DON'T LEAVE THE impatient life. No. Be live as a patient. Patient waiting &gt;&gt; constantly. So wherefore, beloved, seeing that you look for such thing, be diligent that you may be found in him in peace without spot and blameless and account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation, even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him had written unto you. as also in all his epistles speaking in them of these things in which are some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable rest as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction this is a good scripture if people come why why you are following a man and everything no we are not following a man we're following the Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; but Lord Jesus Christ has given us thank God has given us a seer Amen. &gt;&gt; Someone who can warn us ahead &gt;&gt; like Peter by God's grace he walked with Jesus Christ in the flesh &gt;&gt; but he recognized no God has sent a minister send a prophet a seer thankful thank God for Paul because Paul is warning us what's coming. So he's recognizing in the age that the God has sent a prophet to warn us about the coming of the Lord and he puts at the right place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless brother Peter for that. Amen. So that a good scripture someone doesn't understand why you believe in a prophet. So also in all his I read that part ye therefore beloved seeing you know these things before be aware lest ye also being led away with the errors of the wicked fall from your own steadfast fastness. Once again the word steadfastness but grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God called Abraham. He said, "I heard the word of God when I was 75 years old told me something that was absolutely against all reasons. I would have it would have been a super times, super miracles, but I was going to have a wife 65 years old to produce a son to me when she was 65 years old." When went down, let's go on. So there was Mr. Unbeliever, Mr. Scoffer, Mr. Skeptic, all them standing around. They scoffed and laughed at me, called me father of nations. When I had no children, I kept believing every moment, every month, it will happen. She got older and older all the time. But in 25 years later, God kept his word true. It happened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It happened. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes we have forced the interpretation of the word of God and that's where we made our mistakes. God interpret his own word by making it to fulfill. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have put our time. How many remembers Hillary Clinton? We put our time. We put we put there so that this is the time. This is it. This is the one. This is this. We put that, we interpreted our own word and then we put it and then &gt;&gt; we made a mistake. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We put a time. &gt;&gt; Just relax. &gt;&gt; Praise God. It's going to happen &gt;&gt; at his own time. &gt;&gt; Don't interpret the word of God by yourself. The word of God will interpret itself by making itself to be manifested. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are struggling with something, don't try to interpret it. Just leave it to God. God will make it to come to pass in his own time. &gt;&gt; But in the meantime, keep praising him. Keep testifying about him. Keep witnessing. Keep saying, "God has healed me." Do you see it? I don't see it. But God has healed me. CONFESS IT. BE POSITIVE. AMEN. THAT HOW YOU ARE YOU ARE WATERING THE PROMISE OF THE SEED OF GOD. IT WILL COME TO PASS in his own time. Any person can have a burst of faith but then after that they go back to the things they were doing because they did not get the result right away. Only thing you have to do when you you see something in the Bible the prophecy deity of Jesus Christ that just a little or even Jehovah Jar says God is in no hurry. We are the one gets in a hurry. Just give God just a little bit of time and you will see the old prophetic wheels cogs run right into the picture. &gt;&gt; It will develop just like the bringing up of a picture. &gt;&gt; Say just give God time. &gt;&gt; Just give him time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you realize that? Do you recognize that time is our enemy? &gt;&gt; When we put time, that's where the problem starts. Say Jo he that endureth to the end Jesus said the same shall be saved he that endure to the end so it's not the one who start the one start good start is already good &gt;&gt; but if you stop along the way you you are not you are not fulfilled you are not fulfilling you know in the race those who are running oh all start good already all hoping everything but as they start running start running start Oh, one fall one fall along the way. No, no, no, no. That's too long. That's too long. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. At the end. Is those who stayed in the race that they're going to win. It's those not those who studied. It's those who came all the way to the end. Those who endure to the very end, that's the one who going to be saved. So he says just keep looking on. Keep moving slowly. &gt;&gt; GOD KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING. WE ARE THE ONLY one gets in a hurry, not him. &gt;&gt; He let the Hebrew children walk right in the fiery furnace before he even turned the page over to write a new article. Should God is not in a hurry? The angels were IN A HURRY. GOD, DON'T YOU SEE YOUR CHILDREN? THEY'RE GOING TO BE THEY WILL BE THEY'LL BE DEAD IN THE FURRY FURNACE. CAN'T YOU MOVE? God just Oh, I'm just TAKING MY TIME. DON'T YOU SEE THAT I'M DYING? DON'T H GOD is just taking his time. If I'm putting God is taking time but God has no time. God is just watching. BUT EVEN THE ANGELS THEY BECAME IMPATIENT. DON'T DON'T use maybe the Hebrew children they thought you know Shadrach you know I think once we get near the door we just see you know God will send the flood and it'll be good. But as they're moving on nothing is changing. Oh sh Meshach are you sure? Are are you still standing? If you read the statue of prophet man prophet is commenting. Are you sure? You hold. Oh, I'm sure whether I die or not God I I will not deny God's word. &gt;&gt; I will stay patient. I will stay perseverant. I'll keep continue. &gt;&gt; I beg the go. Are you sure? Oh yes, I'm sure. I continue walking whether I die or not. I keep pressing on. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; It's 12:30. Oh, we are one hour. So all this time we have been eating one hour ahead of the normal time. So it's 11:30. Oh, thank God. So So are you sure Shadrach, Meshach, Abbeo? Oh yes, I'm sure. I'm sure. I keep pressing her. And then but all the other one were impatient. Angel were impatient. But God was knew at what time he's going to intervene. Praise be to God. AND HE DID INTERVENE AND RESCUE THEM. AS LONG AS THEY STAND WITH THE WORD OF GOD, GOD WAS IN CONTROL. AMEN. &gt;&gt; The Hebrew children stepped right into a fiery furnace. But there was one there like the the son of man. God is no hurry. You are the one gets in a hurry, not God. God's right on time. Oh, brother. He's right on time. Let the rockets fly, the atomic bombs, the hydrogen. God's right on time. The church is going home one of these days right on time. &gt;&gt; We are going in the RAPTURE RIGHT ON TIME. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO THERE'S NO we are late and WE ARE THINGS. NO, GOD IS ON TIME ALL THE TIME. AMEN. &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE to God. &gt;&gt; Now listen to this exposition of seven churches. Revelation 3:10. Because I has kept the word of my patience. the word of my patience. I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwelt upon the earth. What does he mean the word of my patience? Hebrews 6:13:15 for whom God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I will bless thee multiplying I will multiply thee. So after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. You see, the spirit is speaking about the word of God which is given to us to wait for the fulfillment of what God required patience even as it did in the case of Abraham. He endured as seeing him who is invisible. He was patient and then the word finally was fulfilled. This is the way God teaches his people patience. Why? If he fulfills his word in physical manifestation, now listen this. If he fulfills his word in physical manifestation, the very instant you prayed, you will never learn patience and you will become even more impatient &gt;&gt; with life. So God does that on purpose. &gt;&gt; It's not a lack of your fa. No, you have faith, you believe, you accept. But God doesn't give it to right away because if he continue to give everything right away, you'll become even more impatient with life &gt;&gt; because you will be expecting everything to happen right there right there, right there. And you can't grow because you become very impatient. Have you ever traveled with kids from here to Calgary and you promise them good things? Are we there yet? &gt;&gt; Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet? They don't learn now to become patient. So God trains you, &gt;&gt; trains me &gt;&gt; to learn to be patient. &gt;&gt; They that wait upon the Lord, &gt;&gt; shall receive. Let me show you this truth even more fully set forth in Hebrews 11:17 prophet continues by faith Abraham when he was tried offered Isaac and he that receiveth the promises the word of God offered up his only begotten son that is Abraham was tried after he received the word of promise and that's the key God gives you a promise When God gives you a promise, that's when the trial of your faith starts. &gt;&gt; If you don't give, that's why I put the example of a child. If you don't give a child a promise, he's not expecting anything. &gt;&gt; He's going he's not going to bother you anything. &gt;&gt; But the moment you promise them, says, "Okay, I will give you, you know, I made a mistake one time. I'll give you a I will give you a phone when you're 12 years old, not before. Oh la, &gt;&gt; I don't I don't stop hearing it. &gt;&gt; Daddy, when is my phone? &gt;&gt; Because I gave the promise, right? &gt;&gt; But I even gave the time, but they don't look at the time. Sometimes as even we grow, it's the same thing for us. &gt;&gt; Actually, we are struggling because God has given us a promise. Abraham the test started when God gave him a promise &gt;&gt; said I will give you a child then where this problem started if Abraham was okay maybe that's my destiny I won't be a child and everything Abraham will be living a normal life and everything but once he HAS A PROMISE &gt;&gt; THEN THE TRIAL of your patience start &gt;&gt; now when you look into the bible of the god's b the bible and you see a promise THERE AND YOU GRAB that promise You also have to remember as you read that Bible, as you have that promise, the test of your patience are there because it's a promise. But don't put time to that promise. Don't say it has to happen now. No, just leave it. Believe and leave it to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that's where the test of the prophet is putting a concept here. So after he received the word of promise, Abraham was tried after he received the word of promise. Most think that as soon as we prayed in Jesus' name over the good promises of God that there could be no not a trial. They could there could not be a trial. But here it says that Abraham was tried after he received the promise. That is exactly correct according to the psalmist referring to Joseph in Psalm 105:19. Until the time that his word came, the word of the Lord tried him. Look at the life of Joseph. He was a simple simple little boy. His father loved him and everything. But when God gave him a promise to the dream that he had one day you'll see your siblings, you'll see the the Swed say the in English those will be bowing. So the wheat the wheats they'll be bowing they'll be bow they will be bowing to him as in the dream as he saw the stars. Amen. Just that word escaped me from my mind. But you see the stars they will be bowing to be bowing to the to another star. THEY RECOGNIZE EVEN EVEN WITHOUT interpretation the brothers recognized. H so we will be he think that we'll be subject to him. &gt;&gt; The father himself. So Joseph do you mean this? Do you mean I'll be subject to you? But he kept that. He didn't question being a prophet. He didn't question that. You just leave it NOT KNOW. BUT SINCE he was given that promise, &gt;&gt; then the problem started. &gt;&gt; As brother explained so well for Jacob. After Jacob had received the blessings, after he received the promise, then the problem started. &gt;&gt; After God has given that promise to Joseph, then the problem started. Joseph was the type of perfection. Perfection. But the problem started when he started a problem. And then the brothers started hating him even more. They started hating him even more. They put him in the pit. They sold him. I'm sure as a human being, Joseph was thinking, "God, how is your promise going be to &gt;&gt; I'm here in the pit. How how can they bow to me being in the pit here? How is your promise going to be fulfilled?" &gt;&gt; The word of God is trying him now. The promise is trying you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yet our trials was not when we were in the world. We were living like everybody and everything and everything all this is the expression life happens. Oh, life happens. Huh? But once you become a Christian, YOU HAVE PROMISES OF GOD and no if you are a believer, you will be saved and your children will be saved AND THEN YOU YOU ARE HOLDING ON THAT PROMISE AND YOU DON'T SEE IT. YOU WHAT YOU WHAT YOU HAVE A PROMISE BUT YOU DON'T SEE IT HAPPENING. THEN THAT THAT STRUGGLE IS GOING OH LORD WHEN IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS IT TOMORROW AND TOMORROW YOU SEE SOMETIME THINGS get worse again and you TRY TO PUT TIME I WANT IT TO BE THIS THIS YEAR HE HAS TO BE THE here if it's not this year &gt;&gt; and the devil comes on you see didn't happen this year you see then you oh god help me just to relax &gt;&gt; let off the pressure just waiting upon you Lord LET ME STAND THE FACT THAT YOU ARE STANDING YOU ARE AN A CAMERA. &gt;&gt; LET ME STAND. CONTINUE TO STAND LORD UPON THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Joseph when he saw a little bit of Portifa and being promoted maybe thought, "Oh, maybe with Portifa things will going to be go fine and everything is going to be well." Oh, praise be to God. And then the wife of Portify started with them and with him and he had to run and then they put him in in the jail again. &gt;&gt; Oh, really? Really, God? I thought that I thought I thought this was the moment that why Lord why maybe I'm just trying to amplify it why why but the way of God to perfection &gt;&gt; he was working on his character &gt;&gt; to get to somewhere &gt;&gt; God is working on our characters &gt;&gt; the new birth is the easiest place actually as a Christian life the new birth is wonderful Don't reject the new birth. And sometimes you are afraid of the new birth. Now I going to separate from my friends. I'm going no God I accept you. I accept the Lord Jesus Christ to follow. That's the easiest place. Amen. &gt;&gt; But maybe when it comes to the character building, that's where the problem because you have the promise and you don't see happening right now. And the prophet says God gives us exceeding great and precious promises. He has promises to fulfill them. He will. But from the time from the time from the time from the time we pray until the time we get the answer, we must learn to receive patience into our souls. For only in patience do we possess life. May God help us to learn this lesson even as we know the people of this age. He's talking the Philadelphiaian age. Learned patience. We read the story of the lives of those great Christians. What a contrast we see between their lives and ours. For they were so patient and quiet. And today we all we are all but overcome in over impatience and haste. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we want things quick. I'm going to touch something here. I already touched it, but just emphasize it. James 1 2:4 says, "My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into diverse temptations, knowing that from the trying of your faith workketh patience." That's right. But let patience have a work, a perfect work, that you may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing. &gt;&gt; Let patience have a perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To get to perfection, to get to the capstone, we need patience. &gt;&gt; Amen. But sometimes to get that patience, God has to make us pass through some trials &gt;&gt; to learn to wait. &gt;&gt; So every time that you are praying for patience, you know what you are praying for. So God make me more patient. It's actually God give me something that will teach me to be more patient. &gt;&gt; But we still need to pray for that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Job was declared the perfect by God himself. God declared Job as being perfect. God declared Job being perfect. Where did Satan try him the hardest? Yes. It was hard to lose everything in one day. If it was happening to us to me, oh it would be very hard. Very hard. I agree. It's very hard. Very very very hard. He he lost his his wealth, his whole lot, his children. He lost everything in one day. In one day, everything he was definitely down. Thank God for a man of of man OF GOD. THANK GOD FOR THE SEED OF GOD INSIDE of him. Like we still God God give us God take us. PRAISE BE TO GOD. I STILL WORSHIP THE LORD. MAY GOD GIVE US THAT ATTITUDE CONSTANTLY ALL THE TIME DESPITE THE SITUATIONS. PRAISE BE TO GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. But I think you know one of the after chapter one chapter two but you know after Satan has done all that he came back to God but said do you see my servant Job you even I I even allowed you to do things I didn't want to do but because you just want to test it I allowed you to do that actually God provoked Satan &gt;&gt; and then it happened and I say you see what I've done to Job but you know when Job came back and when Satan came back says oh no because you give him his good health. &gt;&gt; Let me put in perspective what we are studying. Oh, I I think I made a mistake there. I made things happen all of a sudden. &gt;&gt; Now I will give him something that will kill him slowly slowly. I will work on the time element because that way then you'll see if he's going he's not going to to curse you then he starts he changes strategy now it went on his health it didn't kill him he didn't it didn't make him in conscience no made him conscience be aware to hear the critics of the friends to hear the things and see and how being rejected he's working on the time element &gt;&gt; are you with He's working on the time element. That's why the Bible says, "Did you learn or have you seen the patience of Job?" Patience of Job &gt;&gt; because it's working on the time. And as a perfect man, Satan knew where where he could try to do something that would make him will make him fall. IT'S THE TIME ELEMENT. TIME ELEMENT. And he came the friend distracting him, the friend talking against him and did a different things. Even the wife what what the device gave him to the wife gave Job why can't you just curse God and die &gt;&gt; it means you make it quicker as you stay there longer it's it's painful &gt;&gt; time element is killing me it's killing you make it FASTER MAKE YOU DIE QUICKLY AND THEN THEN THAT'S it says oh my dear wife you speak like a foolish man Amen. &gt;&gt; Fish woman because those are the one we fall into time element and we trying things to be quick but I will hold on to on God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is more than faithful. &gt;&gt; God is constant. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that not the attitude that we should be having? &gt;&gt; James 5. Take my brethren the prophet who have spoken in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering affliction of patience. Behold, we count them happy which endure. You have heard of the patience of Job and have seen the hand of the Lord and the Lord is peaceful and of tender mercy. &gt;&gt; The same God of Job is our God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You keep standing. &gt;&gt; God who was faithful to Job is faithful to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; James 5 the same 7 verse 7. Be patient, therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husband man waited for the precious fruit of the fruit, and have long patience for it, until he received the early and latter rain. Be also patient. Establish your heart, for the coming of the Lord drawth draweth nigh. Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest you be condemned. Behold, the judge standeth before the door. For I'm telling to you this morning, stand. Be patient. &gt;&gt; Establish your heart. Don't be wavering from here and there. Just stay with the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to prophet saying. I'll be closing in 10 minutes. Says, I know your faith. Exposition of seven churches. Now, he does not say here that he did to the church of Ingamos, you hold my faith. He's not talking about his faith now, but he commended them for their faithfulness. As he does, he also mentions their patience. Now faithfulness and patience go together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In fact, patience is the outcome of faithfulness. For it says in James 1:3, "The trying of your faith workketh patience." There is absolute absolutely no other way in which to gain patience. It has to come by the trial of our faith. Wow, that's a strong statement. &gt;&gt; That's right. There's absolutely no other way in which to gain patience. It has to come by the trial of your faith. You know, sometimes I hate to wait, right? But God will give you someone who makes you wait just to train to to train you on your patience. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Romans 5:3, tribulation work of patience. How highly God regard this outworking of our patience is seen in James 1:4. But let patience have perfect work that you may be perfect and entire lacking nothing. God's will for us is perfection. And that perfection is patience. Waiting on God, waiting for God. This is the process of character development. The prophet speaking. This is the process of character development. How highly God has commanded the saints of the dark ages. Patient as lambs lay to the slaughter. Laughling, faithfully they served God. This is all they wanted out of life. Just serve the Lord. How great was their reward. Amen. Romans 5:3 that we read says, "Not only so, but we glory in tribulation also knowing that tribulation work of patience and patience experience and experience hope." Amen. So every time the Lord give me more patience in other words God give me a little bit of something that will help me &gt;&gt; to shape my patience and we should be time is you know that I'll take too much time but time has slipped on me um uh just want to read what the prophet says here says um we we we should have patience the second part we should have patience with one another too one time we get too much impatient with one another. We get so much impatient with one anothers. Sometimes we have even impatient with unbelievers. But when it comes to the believers ourselves are very impatient. We want things done. We want things now. So we think we got to be like Moses. We think we got to be like Moses. Moses had patience with the people. Look that what caused them not to go over. They're trying to do I've tried to get this message over to the tabernacle to see that each member of the tabernacle becomes this. It's hard to do. I've tried to have patience. This 33 years prophet speaking. Have patience. Women still bob the hair still just the same. But just but just have patience. Just have patience. Wait. Have to. If you ain't got it, don't try to build on this down here. Have patience. Someone need to remind me this if with the Lord ter because I'm sure I will forget this &gt;&gt; because you preached and you don't see any change. &gt;&gt; It's like I want it to happen tomorrow. I after my message I thought no one will do that but I'm sure you will do it again and then I'll be May someone remind me about this. God give me patience. But one time when the rebellion the rebellion bunch of people had such impatience they caused Moses to do something was wrong. But yet when it come to the showdown God got sick of their action. He said separate yourself Moses. I'll kill the whole bunch of them and start a new. He throwed himself in the bridge and said God don't do it. What patience with the people that was rebelling against him. Oh, may God give us that patience. &gt;&gt; Parents, may God give us patience. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you see that my kid, I've told you, I told them, but you see like still they're not, oh God, maybe you're working on my patience. Help me to be patient. It's God doing at our own time. &gt;&gt; Those who wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. &gt;&gt; Waiting doesn't mean that you just you you're not doing anything. Waiting means it's an active action. God, I thank you, Lord. I praise you. I believe you. I'm waiting upon you. Waiting, not waiting with a sad face. No, you're waiting, rejoicing as if it has already been fulfilled that how you're waiting upon the Lord. Thank God. I praise you. I worship you. I keep the joy of salvation. I know it will happen, Lord. I don't see it. I don't I I don't see it. I don't see happening, but I keep praising you. I keep thanking you. I stay faithful to the word of God. I praise you. I glorify your name, Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Once more, one last thought. The prophet says, "We have received the son of man. We have received the message. We have received the son of God. Now we have received the light. Let us learn to to lay down in the light until we ripen." Very often we are not patient enough to stay under the atmosphere of the word of God until we ripe. But may God help us to lay under the presence of the word of God to be patient to stay there. Stay there until God works in our life. Then we will see the result of God. Praise be to God. Musicians can come. Amen. Teach me Lord. Do it. [Music] Teach me Lord to wait down on my knees. You go down. You answer my please. Teach me not to rely on what I do. But to wait in prayer for an answer from you. They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. Oh, they shall mount with me as he goes. Oh, they shall run and not be weary. Oh, they shall walk and not faint. Teach me Lord. Teach me Lord to win. &gt;&gt; Oh teach me Lord to win. My hearts are a flame. Let me humble my pride and then call on your name and keep my faith in you. My eyes on me and let me be on this earth. you want me to be. All they that wait upon the Lord, oh shall renew their strength. All they shall mountain with Lord. They shall run and not be weary. They shall walk and not faint. Oh, teach me Lord. Teach me Lord to wait. &gt;&gt; I like verse two. Teach me Lord to wait while hearts are a flame. Let me humble my pride. Let me call on your name. Keep my faith renewed. That's our prayer. Keep my faith renewed, Lord. My eyes on thee. Let my eyes stays on thee. The problem sometimes we we are not like I say we are not beings of time. When we look at the time that's where we fail. Let's keep our eyes stayed on the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; God gave the promise to Peter. Peter walk on those water. Walk on those trials. Walk on those difficult things. God can't give you something more than what you can stand. He knows what you are standing. He knows you are a gold. He knows that you are a diamonds. Sometime pressure from the outside makes you just better better diamond better gold. But don't look to the external things. Peter start failing when he start looking to those waves. He was already walking. But when he start looking to the waves, look at the circumstances on the outside. Then he lost hope. He start putting timeline. Oh God, I'm I'm going to fail. I'm going to fail. So Peter, Peter, why do you look at that things? You are already walking on the water. The fact that you today are here, you're already standing. You're still an overcomer. Don't look to the outside. Keep focused on the word of God and keep walking. &gt;&gt; Then I wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. There shall mount with wings. They shall run and not be weary. They shall walk and not faint. Teach me Lord. Teach me Lord to. Do you know that song in this time? [Music] &gt;&gt; In his time. &gt;&gt; In his time. He makes all things beautiful in his son. [Music] Lord, please show me every day as you teach me your way that you do just what you say, but in your one more time, let's stand together and let's tell him, Lord, It is time. &gt;&gt; Oh, it is time. &gt;&gt; It is time. &gt;&gt; In God's time, he makes all things beautiful in his time. Lord, please show me every day as you teaching me your way that you do just what you say in your &gt;&gt; Let's try verse two. Oh, in your time. Oh, in your time. &gt;&gt; In your time. You make all things beautiful. In your time, [Music] &gt;&gt; Lord. My life to you. I bring each song I have to sing. give to you a lovely thing. But in your time, let each one just pray to the Lord and say, "Lord, Father, give me a heart that is patient, just looking to you, my eyes focusing on you. Father Lord forgive me where I've been impatient where I have put deadline timeline where maybe father I felt discouraged because it didn't happen on that time and felt like Lord I didn't trust you enough but you are in control of the situation but father now give me a heart that is patient patient with you patient with my brother patient with my sister father As you have been faith, you have been patient with me, Lord. God, I was in the world. I did not know you. But you were patient with me. You took your time, Father. Until one day you called me. Even in my Christian walk with you, you have been patient with me. I failed. I fell down. But Father, you have been patient just raising me up, making me stand again and continue to move on. Father Lord, help me to have the same attitude towards my brother, towards my sister, just to be patient with them, Lord. But help me to stay in the bridge to pray for them with a heart full of love. Help me to pray for my children, full of love, Father Lord, that knowing that Lord, you are in control of every situation. Help me to be oh God patient with my my my wife. Oh God just knowing that you are working the patient way in your time will see result Lord Jesus Christ. Father Lord for the sister I should be praying for her husband.

All the attributes of God being manifested through our life. We thank you Lord for brother Moses for the work that he's done. We so enjoy the word of God this morning Lord. It has done our heart good, Lord Jesus, to to know that we're still standing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That makes us an overcomer. And we're so grateful for that, Lord. I pray that you'd bless him and his family. Bless him as he prepares to go to India. Lord Jesus, it's a great work, Lord. It's a great field and there's lots of work to be done. And I pray that you would prepare him for those days of preaching that he's going to be doing there in India, working for the Lord Jesus. May we, oh God, be faithful and support him in prayer and with our finances, which we are already doing, Lord. And we thank you for that, Lord. Blessed be thy name.

Last time he came but didn't come here, he went to end time. He he um but he's going to minister at a young it's a young minister but I appreciate him a lot and he u he he he expressed the desire to well to to to to show his support. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we thank God for that. So after that, so it'll be the last Sunday for me and um I'll try to be there um to be there on the service cuz it's my annual on call day, but I'll be there and um it'll be uh just another thing is so he has a friend there who was who's a good friend of me but he's a friend to brother Jean. He's a he's a song leader. So he requested not a song but he requested the song service. So he wanted to help with the songs the whole song service as an expression of uh of love and support to the church. I was a little bit surprised by that request and oh that first time I hear it and uh so I asked my wife and the wife said no actually they do that in South Africa and Zimbabwe. seems like a common thing for where they come from. The song leader can express the support to the church and and just take the whole service and as a as a minister take the ministry and then the song service can be taken by someone who has can lead the songs. Okay. It will be a first experience. I hope it's okay with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I I I asked permission to the song leaders first and they they didn't object.

So I'll be there again this evening there and just um until he announced that he was sick or something. So I've not been there to support them with my presence.
