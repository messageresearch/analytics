[26:44] If pressure made in the oceans were ink,
[26:47] it's it's not enough to fill God's love.
[26:51] And I was just thinking about that and
[26:52] and it's this life we live isn't enough.
[26:56] He has to take us out of a temporal
[26:58] world to put us into an eternity where
[27:01] his love will never end. And then it's
[27:03] still it's still not going to be fully
[27:04] expressed. So like we just have a finite
[27:07] understanding of what what God's love
[27:09] is.
[27:25] You are my [music] strength when I
[27:29] [singing] am weak.
[27:31] You are [music] the treure that
[27:34] [singing] I seek.
[27:37] You are my [music]
[27:38] ally.
[27:41] Oh,
[27:47] &gt;&gt; seeking you as a [music] preious.
[27:53] &gt;&gt; I want the [singing]
[27:54] Holy Ghost to rule.

[30:23] He [singing] paid a [music] debt. He did
[30:27] not.
[30:28] I owe a debt. I could not [singing] pay.
[30:34] I needed [music] someone
[30:37] to wash my sins away.
[30:44] And now I sing a brand new [music] song.
[30:50] Amazing grace.
[30:53] All [music and singing] day long. Christ
[30:55] Jesus made a debt that I [singing] could

[32:31] &gt;&gt; How many can say thank you Lord for
[32:33] paying all my debt.
[32:36] I'm debt free now.
[32:38] &gt;&gt; Jesus set me free. Praise be to God.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; Now I don't have any debt to pay
[32:45] &gt;&gt; because the blood of Jesus Christ paid
[32:47] it all. Not in part but paid it all
[32:49] completely. that I don't owe anything.

[35:40] you Sister Wendy and Caleb. God bless
[35:43] you Richie and musicians and all of you.
[35:46] Good to be in the house of the Lord. I
[35:48] invite you to go to the word of God and
[35:50] Romans 12.
[36:06] I just speak for few minutes. I hope
[36:08] very few minutes. I just want to give
[36:10] you priority to prayer today.
[36:13] But um
[36:16] I hope I will not be carried away. I
[36:18] just I didn't prepare too many notes
[36:20] just to restrict myself a few minutes.
[36:23] But you will see.
[36:26] So I want to talk a little bit on the
[36:28] power of transformation.
[36:30] Uh Romans 12 verse one and two.
[36:36] The Bible says I beseech you therefore
[36:39] brethren by the mercies of God that you
[36:42] present your bodies a living sacrifice
[36:46] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[36:50] reasonable service. and be not conformed
[36:53] to this world, but be transformed by the
[36:57] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[37:00] what is that good and acceptable and
[37:04] perfect will of God. Let's go to the
[37:07] Lord in prayer. Father, we thank you for
[37:09] your grace. We thank you, Father, for
[37:10] another opportunity,
[37:12] Lord, to be in your house, Father. the
[37:15] closest place we can get to heaven to be
[37:17] in the house of the Lord, Father, and
[37:20] have fellowship with you around the
[37:22] revealed worthy of the hour. Center of
[37:24] all would have loved to be in the time
[37:26] we are living in. Father, oh God, thank
[37:28] you for helping us to recognize the time
[37:31] and the message of our day. Father,
[37:34] Lord, we are getting closer for that
[37:36] moment of body change, Lord, and a
[37:38] rapture, Lord, but they're looking
[37:40] forward now, Lord. We take every step
[37:43] preciously Lord that as we walk with you
[37:45] have desire to have a closer walk with
[37:47] you father may you visit us once again
[37:51] this evening we thank you for your
[37:52] presence with special presence with a
[37:56] song service prayer father everything
[37:58] that was said and done to prepare us for
[38:00] this time a few words around the word of
[38:03] god and then go in prayer father be with
[38:05] us for the remainder of the service you
[38:07] know our needs father even before we
[38:09] present them to you already nailed
[38:12] Father, we just pray that you give us
[38:13] the right attitude as we approach to
[38:15] you, Father, Lord, and change our mind
[38:18] so that we can have your mind. We give
[38:20] you the glory and the honor. In Jesus
[38:22] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[38:25] God bless you and have a seat.
[38:32] As I said, I just want to speak a little
[38:34] bit on the small thought of the power
[38:36] transformation, a little bit on the line
[38:38] of what we heard on Sunday, but just for
[38:40] a few minutes. As we go in prayer here,
[38:43] uh the Bible says, I'll repeat it again,
[38:47] that you present your bodies a living
[38:49] sacrifice,
[38:51] holy, acceptable unto God, which is your
[38:54] reasonable service as a basic service
[38:56] just to give our body to him. Lord, I
[38:59] give you my heart, I give you my body, I
[39:01] give you my mind as a reasonable
[39:04] service. The minimal thing as a
[39:05] Christian, God, I give you my whole
[39:07] being to you as a sacrifice. We don't
[39:10] belong to ourself. We belong to him. And
[39:13] we want him to have the full preminence
[39:15] on our lives. We don't want to have our
[39:17] own ideas, our own mind, our own
[39:19] directions, but we want his ideas, his
[39:22] directions, his will in our lives. So we
[39:25] want just Lord I want to sanctify the
[39:27] the part that we can do. We want to do
[39:29] our part. We want to sanctify oursel. We
[39:32] want to separate from unbelief. Want
[39:34] separate from anything that is not holy
[39:36] so that we can be accepted to him. Amen.
[39:38] as a as as a reasonable service just a
[39:41] minimal service that can be reasonable.
[39:44] That's what we want to give. Sanctify
[39:45] ourself, give ourselves to him so that
[39:48] he can have full control of our lives.
[39:50] The prophet says in spiritual food
[39:52] induces, he says faith is going to take
[39:55] more faith than ever was in any age for
[39:57] this has to be rapturing faith in the in
[40:00] the age that we are living in. We need
[40:02] rapturing faith. with the age where we
[40:05] must have rapturing faith for the
[40:07] rapturing grace for the rapture and also
[40:10] rapturing faith and rapturing faith
[40:12] requires faith comes by hearing and
[40:15] hearing of the word of God and see if we
[40:17] have to have rapturing faith means we
[40:19] need to have rapturing word amen and we
[40:22] have by God's grace received the
[40:24] revelation of the word of God with
[40:26] perfect vindication to give us rapturing
[40:29] faith amen so we need just to listen
[40:32] more to the word of God to get that
[40:34] rapturing faith says if you want we so
[40:36] we want to believe tonight in all that
[40:39] we have seen all that we have heard the
[40:42] word that we have heard preached the
[40:44] signs and wonders that we have seen done
[40:47] we want to you to accumulate all that
[40:50] together in your heart and consider it
[40:53] whether it is be God or not whatever we
[40:56] have heard whatever we have listened
[40:58] whatever we have seen the miracles and
[40:59] everything we should not put it just
[41:01] something of the past but we to
[41:03] accumulate all that and take it as from
[41:06] God in order to have rapturing faith. No
[41:10] because God has given us example in the
[41:12] word of God has given us example even in
[41:14] our life even experienced life that we
[41:16] have ourself all that we have to
[41:18] accumulate in order to have rapturing
[41:20] faith can't just put things in the past
[41:23] but we have to take everything as a
[41:25] reality in our lives the prophet says in
[41:28] the power of transformation and that
[41:30] what I just want to read quickly here
[41:32] and it says I thought that this was a
[41:34] beautiful thing for this group this
[41:36] morning what we done did he says and
[41:38] remember from verse one to verse two it
[41:41] says
[41:42] now and and is a conjunction as I
[41:45] understand be not confirmed confirmed to
[41:48] this world but be transformed by the
[41:51] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[41:53] what is the good what is that good and
[41:56] acceptable and perfect and will of God
[41:58] so he's not in other words he's saying
[42:00] the verse one and verse two are
[42:02] connected if you want to give God a
[42:05] reasonable service then you also need to
[42:07] be transformed Not only confirmed to the
[42:10] world, not confirmed to the world. We
[42:12] should not be confirmed to the world.
[42:13] It's elementary. We should not be
[42:15] confirmed to the world. We should not
[42:16] follow the world what the world is
[42:17] doing. But we should be transformed. But
[42:19] I would even say go a little bit further
[42:21] here. We should not even
[42:24] only get ourself limited to be confirmed
[42:27] to the word of God. I will explain
[42:29] myself. Just say no. I I'll just try to
[42:32] confirm myself or try to try try to to
[42:36] force myself in something. It is it it
[42:39] is good. It has one part. It is it is
[42:42] good to do that and we have to confirm
[42:44] but it should go more than that. Should
[42:47] be more than that. We should be
[42:48] transformed from the inside out. Our
[42:51] desire should be transformed. Amen. Our
[42:54] desire should be transformed. Our mind
[42:56] should be transformed. So it start with
[42:58] confirming but it goes more than
[43:00] confirming. It has to become a
[43:02] transformation. It is transformation
[43:05] from the inside out. And that what is
[43:07] trying to emphasize it that what we all
[43:09] want to do be not conformed to this
[43:11] world but be transformed by the renewing
[43:13] of our mind to do the perfect and
[43:16] acceptable will of God. So in order to
[43:19] do the perfect and acceptable will of
[43:21] God. We need to be transformed in our
[43:23] mind. We can't rely on our natural mind.
[43:26] We can't rely on our human mind. It has
[43:29] to be the mind of Christ. So God as God
[43:32] as my prayers God I want to be
[43:34] transformed in my mind. I want to be
[43:36] renewed in my mind more. I want I want
[43:39] to die more to myself so that I can have
[43:41] the mind of Christ. I can't rely on my
[43:45] own mind. I have the word has to wash
[43:47] me. The word has to to cleanse me. The
[43:49] words the word has to transform me. The
[43:52] Holy Spirit has to transform me from the
[43:54] inside. I WANT CHRIST to grow deeper to
[43:57] grow to have the preeminence in my life.
[44:00] I I don't I I don't want a baby Christ.
[44:03] I want a grownup Christ. I want to come
[44:05] TO THE FULL STATURE OF THE PERFECT MAN.
[44:07] AMEN. I want to be transformed really
[44:10] from the inside out completely in
[44:12] changing all my mind.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; So now we have seen we have says we have
[44:17] been saved as we are and that we have
[44:20] been filled with the Holy Spirit as we
[44:22] have. So those are good step. We have
[44:24] been saved. That one good step. We have
[44:26] been filled with the Holy Spirit. That
[44:28] one that a good step says but now we
[44:30] want the mind that was in Christ to be
[44:33] in us. The same mind that was in Christ,
[44:36] we need to have it in us to think like
[44:39] him, to love like him, to forgive like
[44:42] him, to be humble LIKE HIM, TO REACT
[44:46] LIKE HIM. OH, THAT TAKES MORE THAN JUST
[44:48] BEING SAVED. That takes more than just
[44:50] be religious. THAT TAKES EVEN MORE THAN
[44:53] JUST TO BE, OKAY, I I I have an
[44:55] experience of the Holy Ghost. It takes
[44:57] more than that. You need to grow to come
[44:59] to the point where I have the mind OF
[45:02] JESUS CHRIST. WHAT will Jesus Christ do
[45:05] in these situations? What would Jesus
[45:07] Christ think in THESE SITUATIONS? THAT'S
[45:10] WHERE I WANT TO GET TO. LORD,
[45:13] even know my prayer. Lord, how would
[45:15] Jesus Christ pray in these situations?
[45:17] That's how I want to get Lord. I don't
[45:20] want to be just a a a a a a I would say
[45:23] a limited Christian. I want to grow. I
[45:26] want I want to increase. I want to come
[45:29] to the fullness of who he is. Because we
[45:32] ARE LIVING IN THE TIME OF THE fullness
[45:33] of the full seed. The same seed that was
[45:36] in the ground. That same seed has to
[45:38] come to the full maturity. THE FULL
[45:41] MATURITY TAKES THE MIND AS WE HAVE TO
[45:43] CHANGE OUR MIND.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; So that we might be transformed the the
[45:51] natural things of life and be brought
[45:54] into do the perfect will of God by
[45:57] transformation of God's spirit by his
[46:01] word. Now he says now my subject is the
[46:04] is the power of transformation. And he's
[46:06] going that he says oh I' I've I've I've
[46:08] gone through many battles in my life. Oh
[46:11] I've gone through many time. I'm old and
[46:13] I've been through many hard battles.
[46:15] See, but going through those hard
[46:17] battles brings you where you are this
[46:19] morning. Says, I'm sure you understand
[46:21] that God has put me through it through
[46:24] it that my life might open up a way to
[46:27] say this is it. See that you all run
[46:30] over that road before me there was
[46:33] someone open up the way for me to go
[46:35] through. Maybe you don't understand what
[46:37] you are going through. Maybe see that
[46:38] I'm going through this trials. I'm going
[46:40] through this battle. But the God give me
[46:42] your mind. Give me give me your
[46:45] thinking. Let me think the way you
[46:46] think. Let me see even this trial the
[46:48] way you will see a little maybe you are
[46:50] just opening up. Bring me to a certain
[46:53] maturity you want me to have. Lord help
[46:55] me to analyze it in a way not as human
[46:58] will a human being will but the way
[47:00] Christ will see it. Amen.
[47:07] Then he said transforming. We are used
[47:09] to work in a public service company
[47:11] where we are transformers and to
[47:13] transform. Now the word the word means
[47:15] in itself something to transform means
[47:17] something that been changed something
[47:19] that is changed from one thing to
[47:21] another. As I want to speak the next
[47:24] just they say to be transformed is to be
[47:27] changed and made something different.
[47:29] That what that was my that that what
[47:31] caught my attention again here is a
[47:33] tadpole. It's transformed from a tadpole
[47:36] to a frog. See, once he looked like a
[47:39] catfish, he swims around. He's got a
[47:41] head and his tail and everything looks
[47:43] like he's a catfish. Then after a while,
[47:45] he begins to lose. He loses the tail. Is
[47:48] transformed from one species to another.
[47:51] Oh yes, I'm It's still the same thing.
[47:55] It's still the same person or if you can
[47:57] call it the person, but still the same
[47:58] animal, but it's changing stages. is
[48:02] changing stages as is growing is losing
[48:05] certain things as our Christian walk and
[48:08] then you you you have a Christian. Oh, I
[48:10] am I'm I'm a Christian. I'm walking with
[48:12] God. Yes. But maybe you are still at the
[48:14] stage of a tadpole. [laughter]
[48:18] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You will get there one
[48:20] day. But but God in the stage of
[48:22] tadpole, yeah, you do your best and
[48:24] everything. But what is the secret? Just
[48:27] stay in the channel. Amen. and feed upon
[48:31] the word of God.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; The more you are feeding, the more the
[48:34] transformation is happening is happening
[48:36] from the inside. The more you ARE
[48:38] STAYING IN THAT CHANNEL, the more you
[48:39] are feeding upon the word of God and the
[48:42] tadpole one day, oh, you lose your tail.
[48:44] Oh, the tail is gone. I USED TO HAVE A
[48:46] LITTLE BIT OF MALICE, A LITTLE BIT OF A
[48:48] HANGER, a little bit, BUT IT'S GONE. HOW
[48:51] COME IT'S GONE? WHO REMOVED IT? NOT
[48:53] SOMEONE WHO CAME AND FORMED you to
[48:54] remove it or or trying to make you
[48:56] conform to it. NO, IT TRANSFORMED FROM
[48:59] THE INSIDE FROM WHAT YOU ARE EATING and
[49:02] from the STAYING IN THE CHANNEL OF GOD
[49:04] TO STAYING IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD. AMEN.
[49:07] THEN THE TRANSFORMATION IS happening
[49:08] from the inside and ONE DAY YOU BECOME A
[49:11] FROG.
[49:13] [laughter]
[49:14] That's a bad example. But
[49:19] [laughter]
[49:20] then one DAY IT'S A FROG AND THEN OH
[49:22] YEAH. OH YEAH. BUT IT'S still the same
[49:26] thing that change, right? Okay, let's
[49:29] take a better example.
[49:31] You are a worm.
[49:34] You are a worm, but one DAY YOU'LL BE A
[49:36] BUTTERFLY, RIGHT? THAT'S A BIT better
[49:38] example. [laughter]
[49:42] A worm and you're just there and you're
[49:44] just earthly and then nothing is
[49:47] happening and you're still crawling and
[49:50] things things happening, things
[49:52] bothering you and things like that. BUT
[49:54] AS YOU FEED MORE AND WE HAVE RECEIVED
[49:57] the spiritual food in due season. It's
[50:00] the it's the food is the eagle food. The
[50:03] more you eat it, the more you eat it,
[50:05] the more you eat it, the more it's
[50:07] changing your inside. It's changing your
[50:10] inside that you can't explain. You can't
[50:12] you can't you you can't scientifically
[50:15] PROVE IT. BUT IT'S CHANGING YOU. AND
[50:17] THEN ONE DAY YOU START FLYING
[50:20] [clears throat] ABOVE THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
[50:21] above the situations. The same trial
[50:24] that used to bother you a few years ago,
[50:26] the same trials comes, but you are
[50:28] FLYING ABOVE THE TRIAL. SAYS, "OH,
[50:30] PRAISE BE TO GOD. LORD, I KNOW YOU ARE
[50:33] IN CONTROL OF EVERY SITUATION. I KNOW
[50:35] YOU WILL GIVE ME DELIVERANCE BECAUSE IF
[50:37] YOU DELIVERED ME THERE, YOU CAN DELIVER
[50:39] ME TODAY. YOU made me go through certain
[50:41] trials, BUT I KNOW YOU WILL GIVE ME THE
[50:44] VICTORY. YOU ARE MY HEALER. YOU ARE MY
[50:46] SAVIOR. YOU ARE MY PROVIDER. YOU ARE MY
[50:49] HOLY LORD. YOU ARE MY REDEEMER. YOU ARE
[50:52] CHANGING ME. YOU HAVE GIVEN ME THE
[50:54] PROMISE FOR THE RAPTURE.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; ALL THE THING WORKS TOGETHER FOR THOSE
[50:58] WHO LOVE YOU. Lord
[51:01] &gt;&gt; transformation. Lord change my mind.
[51:04] Father change my mind.
[51:09] See once he looked in I see I read that
[51:11] says being transformed by the renew.
[51:14] Let's see. Let me get that right. Be not
[51:16] confirmed. You know what's confirmed is
[51:18] renewing of your mind. The things that
[51:20] you once thought upon to be precious.
[51:23] You lay that aside and be transformed to
[51:26] something else that was one times to
[51:28] what you are now by the renewing of your
[51:30] mind that you might prove that good,
[51:32] acceptable, perfect will of God. That's
[51:34] what we want to know how to do it. Says
[51:37] here we love here we are here. We love
[51:40] him. He saved us. Now we want to know
[51:43] what to do. We are trying to take a
[51:46] little step this morning to raise up a
[51:47] little bit higher. Sometimes we have to
[51:50] hit these things and hold on and we see
[51:53] that it comes out. Then you take an
[51:54] example say look at in Genesis what
[51:56] happened in Genesis was complete
[51:58] darkness, complete chaos and how how it
[52:01] used to be complete chaos. And God says
[52:03] let the light be just the word of God.
[52:06] And that word of God came and it changed
[52:08] from that chaos from that darkness that
[52:10] came something real. They came the earth
[52:13] came the all the the all the planets
[52:15] came something real. Then we used to be
[52:17] in sin. We used to be in different
[52:19] things completely darkness and all this.
[52:21] Then we heard the light the word of God.
[52:23] LET THE LIGHT BE IN OUR SOUL. AND THEN
[52:25] WE GRASP at the word of God. We believed
[52:27] it and we HAVE BEEN CHANGED. SOMETHING
[52:30] has happened in our life. Amen. BUT IT'S
[52:32] NOT THE END OF IT. GOD CONTINUED THE
[52:34] CREATION AND AT ONE TIME AND THEN he
[52:36] [clears throat] had to create and he
[52:37] create a garden of Eden said it
[52:39] transform into a garden of Eden. And
[52:41] that's how we are transformed by the
[52:42] God's words. When God said let there be
[52:44] light and that mass of creation out
[52:46] there comes over and around the sun and
[52:49] begin to revolve around the sun and
[52:50] became a garden of Eden because it
[52:53] obeyed the word of God. The the the
[52:56] world had to obey the word of God.
[52:59] That's what became THE GARDEN OF EDEN.
[53:01] THE SAME PROCESS THAT WE'RE GOING
[53:03] THROUGH. IF WE COME TO BECOME THE GARDEN
[53:05] OF EDEN IN OUR SOUL, WE HAVE TO OBEY THE
[53:07] WORD OF GOD. Believe the word of God.
[53:10] AMEN. THAT'S WHERE RESIDE IN THE POWER
[53:12] of transformation. Then he says, you
[53:15] know, sometimes we are in a hurry, but
[53:17] God is not in a hurry.
[53:19] Sometimes we are in a hurry, but God is
[53:21] not in a hurry. We just need to have
[53:24] faith in him and trust in him. Amen.
[53:27] Then we get to the level I'm trying to
[53:28] save time. Then we get to the level it
[53:30] says then we come to the level where he
[53:33] said let seed each seed produce of it
[53:36] same of it same kind. Then you see the
[53:39] seed that will produce of the same kind.
[53:41] If you have an orange orange seed it
[53:43] will produce an orange and in that seed
[53:47] there is everything that needs to
[53:49] produce an orange tree. in that seed.
[53:52] So it has all the potential to produce
[53:55] the orange tree and then the seed that
[53:58] the orange that will come later on in
[54:00] that small seed. That's the same thing
[54:03] we as God has put in our heart in our
[54:05] soul. The seed of God inside our soul.
[54:08] Amen. What we need that seed to be
[54:11] quickened by the word of God. It to be
[54:13] quickened by the son of God. Amen. Once
[54:15] it has been quickened THEN NEEDS TO
[54:17] GROW. BUT IT CONTAINS inside of it all
[54:20] the potentials. We shall need to let we
[54:23] shall let that potential to be
[54:25] manifested. Amen. We have to let it TO
[54:27] BE MANIFESTED. THEN THE KEY to it is all
[54:31] the power transformation of that seed to
[54:34] be changed from that seed and to become
[54:36] a plant and then to produce fruit. All
[54:38] the power is contained in that seed.
[54:42] Everything is contained in that. is not
[54:44] taking something from the outside to
[54:46] make that seed to be changed from a se
[54:48] from a lemon to become a orange. No, if
[54:51] it is an orange, it will STAY A ORANGE.
[54:53] IT HAS THE POTENTIAL OF AN ORANGE INSIDE
[54:56] THAT SEED. AMEN. We have the potential
[54:58] to become the full mature CHRISTIANS IN
[55:01] OUR AGE. AMEN. [gasps] BUT WHAT WE need
[55:03] is to receive the word that will bring
[55:06] us to that maturity and is to receive
[55:08] the the THE SUN THE SUN SU N THAT WILL
[55:12] BRING US TO THAT MATURITY. AMEN. THE SON
[55:15] OF THE MORNING IS still the same son.
[55:17] Amen. IT'S STILL THE SAME BIBLE. BUT NOW
[55:20] WE HAVE THE revelation of the word of
[55:22] God upon the Bible to bring us THE
[55:25] LIGHT, THE LIFE OF IT SO THAT WE CAN
[55:27] MANIFEST WHAT IS INSIDE OF US. NOW IT IS
[55:30] THE HARVEST SON OF GOD. AMEN. THE LIGHT
[55:33] THAT SHINE UPON US HAS TO PRODUCE THE
[55:36] LIFE of the maturity.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; GOD CHANGED ME TO PRODUCE THE LIFE OF
[55:42] THE MATURITY. NOT A BABY LIFE BUT A LIFE
[55:45] OF MATURITY. LORD, LIFE OF PRAYER, LIFE
[55:48] of trust, life of confidence in you.
[55:50] LORD, I WANT TO GET THERE. FATHER,
[55:53] is that YOUR DESIRE IN MY HEART? IT'S
[55:55] SOMETHING THAT IS BURNING INSIDE OF ME.
[55:57] LORD, I WANT TO GET THERE. I WANT TO
[55:59] MANIFEST CHRIST, THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST,
[56:03] the humility of Christ
[56:08] says,
[56:11] hopefully I can finish with this one.
[56:13] Says everything under control to bring
[56:15] forth of its kind. Now remember to bring
[56:17] when he puts the seed on the earth the
[56:19] seed can only come forth with the power
[56:22] of life within it to transform it from a
[56:26] seed to a plant or whatever it was his
[56:30] transforming power. Now God put the seed
[56:34] in there with potentials that it will be
[56:36] what he said it will be. And as long as
[56:39] it stayed in right category, it will be
[56:43] just exactly what say what God said it
[56:46] will be. It had to be that way because
[56:50] he had made it that way. made a channel
[56:53] that anything that stays in his channel,
[56:56] in his line of word, it will have to
[56:59] produce forth exactly like his word said
[57:03] it will do.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, your word says that that
[57:09] there will be a a a a mature bride in
[57:13] this last age. Yes. If I stay in that
[57:16] channel, if I stay in that category, I
[57:18] stay in line with the word of God, it
[57:21] will produce what the word of God says.
[57:24] I believe it with all my heart.
[57:27] It cannot move from there. It's
[57:29] channeled right just exactly right. So
[57:32] with everything in the trust in his own
[57:35] s
[57:37] then it will be that way. Then God said
[57:39] it's all good. So it will just rest. And
[57:42] each one of those seeds has power in
[57:45] itself to transform itself into the
[57:49] specy that I desire it to be. That what
[57:53] m that what it must be because I have
[57:56] given every seed transforming power.
[58:02] It's not something from the outside nor
[58:04] it within the seed. He has given every
[58:07] seed that transforming power to make out
[58:11] of itself in its potentials now to make
[58:14] out of itself exactly what I want it to
[58:18] be
[58:22] my my
[58:24] so may God help us to change our
[58:26] thinking
[58:27] &gt;&gt; help us to change our thinking that it
[58:29] is there it is in there we are in the
[58:32] season now help me to stay in that
[58:34] channel Lord Lord, fill me with more of
[58:37] the Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost, fill me with
[58:40] more of your of the manifest the power
[58:42] that is inside of us by the Holy Ghost.
[58:45] Amen. God, help me maybe to pray more.
[58:48] Help me maybe to read more. Maybe help
[58:50] me to dedicate myself more. Help me
[58:52] maybe to to just to stay more in that
[58:55] channel, Lord, so that it can be
[58:57] manifested. Oh God, maybe in other place
[59:00] you say the power of healing is inside
[59:02] of you. If you need healing is inside of
[59:05] you. The power of deliverance is inside
[59:07] of you. Lord, help me to stay in that
[59:09] channel. Don't let me move. Don't let me
[59:11] look at different things. Don't let me
[59:12] be disturbed. Don't let me be
[59:15] distracted. Help me to STAY IN THAT
[59:17] CHANNEL. LORD, THAT'S WHERE THE LIFE IS.
[59:19] THAT'S WHERE the manifestation of your
[59:21] life is. Lord, help me to stay stable in
[59:24] humility in that channel. Father, that's
[59:27] what I desire.
[59:30] Maybe the quote, last quote here maybe
[59:31] to challenge us a little. He says, "I
[59:34] might sing too much. I might preach too
[59:36] much." We can sometimes preach too much.
