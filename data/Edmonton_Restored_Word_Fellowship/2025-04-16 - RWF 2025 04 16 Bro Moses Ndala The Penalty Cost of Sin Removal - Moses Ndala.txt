And God bless you richly and &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I will invite you to go to the word of God. It's a prayer meeting. I made myself decision not to prepare a lot where I'm not carried away. So if my cup is empty, I quit. So um so just go to the word of God in Isaiah chapter 3 and the prayer was just in line for what I wanted to share. I I I had a thought to continue on what I preach on Sunday, but I was just listening to brother Banam this to prepare for Easter and just turn my my thought to go to this one and just to to share the few thought on this prayer meeting. Isaiah 53 familiar scripture prophet used it. Um I'll read to verse six five and I'll let you sit and I'll continue. Isaiah 53 verse one. who had believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground yet no form nor comeliness but when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him. It's talking about the Lord Jesus Christ is despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. and we hid as it were our faces from him. He was despised and we esteemed him not. Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows. Yet we did esteem him, stricken, smitten of God and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed. Amen. May God bless his word. Can have a seat. As relied in verse four here say, "Surely he has borne our griefs, carried our sorrows, yet we did esteem him stricken and smitten, not smitten of man, but smitten of God. God has to smite him in order to afflict him, in order to carry our griefs and our sorrows and our wounds and and all that we can have. He carried them upon himself and he was wounded for our transgressions. As we are reading this, you can put your name there. He was wounded for my transgressions. He was bruised for my iniquities. Oh yes, do we have iniquities? Yes, we have iniquities. It's even more pertinent to us sometimes because we know sometimes the truth. We know what we should do but we don't do it. We should know what we should not do but we still do it. And then God say he was bruised for our iniquities. And the chastisement of our peace or for my peace was upon him. And we've his stripes we are healed. I am healed. Amen. &gt;&gt; And all we like sheep have gone astray. We have turned everyone to his own way. And the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all. Not only of some of us, but for us all. He took all our iniquities. He was oppressed and he was afflicted. Yet he opened not his mouth. He's brought as a lamb to the slaughter as a sheep before his sheerers is dumb. So he opened not his mouth. He was taken from prison and from judgment. Oh, and who shall declare his generation? For he was cut off out of the of the land of the living. For the transgression of my people was he stricken. He was he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence. Neither was any deceit in his mouth. So he was completely innocent. &gt;&gt; He was a perfect lamb of God. Nothing that could put upon him. Even Pilate say he's innocent. Even Judas who betrayed himself had to declare I I betrayed an innocent man. So even even even even the climax of the devil on earth, Judas himself says, "No, this one is innocent." Oh, what a precious lamb of God we had. &gt;&gt; But it pleased the Lord to bruise him. It pleased God to bruise him, yet put him to grief. when that shall make his soul an o an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, and he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand. And he shall see he shall see of the travail of his soul, and he shall be satisfied. By his knowledge shall my righteous servants justify many, for he shall bear their iniquities. We know what justification is. Is if you have never done it, that's what he has done for us. That's what our Lord has done for us. Taken all our iniquities, all our sins and washed it by the blood of the lamb to point that where God look at us, he see the very righteousness of himself doesn't see our sins iniquities anymore. Oh, the color of the blood is red and my sins were red. When look red through see red through red becomes white. Oh, glory to his name. said, "Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong, because he had poured out his soul unto death, and he was numbered with the transgressors, and he bear his sin, the sin of many, and made in intercession for the transgressors." &gt;&gt; Amen. What a wonderful scripture. What a wonderful scripture. So this week is the week of u of the Easter and I was just checking in the in the prophet was say there and says in the quote of the prophet is the only week he call it the holy week &gt;&gt; is the the holy week so it's it's a week where we have to go with with a little bit more consecration I think it's a it's a week where we can little bit just stop and think about what he has done in our lives and just we realize where we come from. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes we can think that, okay, we we it's because of my works, because of what I've done is the numbers of years, the message or all that. Thank God for all those things. But it was so good just to come back a little bit and say, "Oh, God, I you took me from the marlay. You took me from from that pit. You took me from that place where I did not deserve anything, but you took me from that place and you washed me. You cleansed me as the prayer was made. You died for me. No one could pay the price for me. No one could pay the debt. No one could take my place. But you came at my place and took my place. You died for me. Oh Lord Jesus Christ, I want to serve you. I want to live for you. I realize where I come from. Father, thank you for your grace in my life. It's only your grace. Only your grace, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, without you, I will be lost. The grace of God took me from that place. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. Thank you. Thank you for the lamb of God. Thank you for Calvary. Oh, Lord, thank you. Jesus took me place. &gt;&gt; Sorry. Salvation is free &gt;&gt; for us, but he had to die for us. &gt;&gt; It's free for us, but he had to die for us. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Prophet says, "But did you ever stop to think?" Sorry. Did you ever stop to think what it cost to have it? &gt;&gt; Did you ever realize just the price that behind it? &gt;&gt; What judgment was? What a penalty of sin was. How cruel sin was just to save me Lord. Oh, thank you Lord. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I didn't have anything to present to you, but you died on my house. Thank you, Lord. You say, "How how cruel must sin be when it caused the son of God to go to Calvary and God will strike him and turn his face from him and smite him and he will be afflicted? He smited so hard that God couldn't look at him. Oh, heaven could look at him. Oh God, why would you do such thing? God, why would you go so dumb? Lord, why would you go so down? But he was thinking of you thinking of him. Oh God, thank you for Calvary. Thank you, Lord, for Calvary. He said, I was thinking of you. I know one day you'll be sick. That's why I'm going through this. Oh Lord, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh Lord. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Oh, they pull his beer. The beer they spit on him, crashed on him. Oh, he didn't say one word. He thought of you. I thought of me with my mistakes, with my iniquities, my wrongdoings. Oh Lord, that lamb of God, perfect, perfect, perfect without blemish. But he thought he, oh, I will give my life for him. I'll give my life for my children because I cannot be complete without them. They are my children. I can I cannot enjoy heaven without my children. Those were the despised one. Oh God, but he took my place. He took your place, brothers and sisters. That's the God we serve. It's not by law. It's not by anything. But when we look into that, when we we zoom in the love of God. Oh, thank you, Father, for your love. That's why we are here, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, but &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; As you look in the in the type. Oh, you look in the type as as God. We look into garden of Eden as you saw Adam and his his wife as a sin and went away from the grace of God. God himself has to come down. He didn't have to to send an angel. He didn't have to send anyone else. Himself has to come down as a type. I cannot let my children be lost. I will come down. &gt;&gt; And himself came down. &gt;&gt; He came down. Can you imagine the eternal God? &gt;&gt; The eternal God crying, "Adam, Adam, where are you? Adam, where are you? Adam, looking for you. Where are you, my son? Where are you?" He certainly knew where he was, but he still crying. Where are you, Adam? &gt;&gt; Oh Lord. &gt;&gt; And he came down. The eternal God himself, the eternal life, he had to kill. The eternal God had to perform death for the first time of all humanity because of the children. Oh God himself, I have to kill. I have to kill a lamb, animal lamb. I'm eternal life, but I have to cause death. I have to cause death because of my son. It's not Satan who killed the first animal. God himself had to kill that lamb &gt;&gt; to cover his own son. &gt;&gt; Oh to show great redemption of God, great love of God. The great love of God. Oh, praise be to God. Praise be to God. If we look at Calvary with the right hand, right eyes and oh God, give us revelation of Calvary. Give us more revelation of what Calvary means for us. as you came down and took that lamb and he killed him and he cover his son is cover his daughter thinking of the perfect lamb that will be his slain. Oh, many years later that was slain before the foundation of the world but that will be made in reality. Many years later he was thinking of that. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise be to his name. &gt;&gt; Praise be to our God. Thank you Jesus for your grace. Thank you for Calvary. Jesus had to die of his own will. &gt;&gt; No one pushed him. &gt;&gt; No one pushed him. &gt;&gt; He had to die of his own will. The Bible says when he cried with loud voice, he yielded up with the ghost. &gt;&gt; The the Greek word that is mentioned there says he had to give up himself. &gt;&gt; He had he had he had to surrender. He had he had to die. No one had to take his life. It's not the Romans who killed him. is not the spear who killed that killed him. He's not the sword. It's not the nails. It's not even the blood that came out of it that he had to die that way. It was himself he decided he s he died of sorrow. He said because he came to his own and they rejected him and he had himself as a lamb. I have to pay the price for them. &gt;&gt; I have to pay the price for my children because if I don't do it, no one else could do it. But I have to do it &gt;&gt; as a type of Abel. Oh, Kane came with his with his fruit with with the works and the different things he has done. Oh Lord, can you see what I've done? Can you see what I've done? That was Kane attitude. I've done this. I've done this. I've done this. I'm being in the beauty. But Abel is just a lamb, a small lamb, a tiny lamb that is bringing to God. Abel, why are you bringing that innocent animal? Why you bring that that innocent animal? Why can't you give a sacrifice that is so clean like mine? Kenob could ask, "Why can't you?" He he caught into the revelation of God. The mind of God &gt;&gt; I will have. God has to give the lamb, the perfect lamb of God, the innocent one, the innocent one that could take the place of Abel. &gt;&gt; And as Abel was was slaughtering and and cutting the throat of that animal, do you realize they didn't have knife? They didn't didn't have gun. They didn't have that could kill him directly. He he had he had to smite him. He had to smite all the time. I had to smite many times. many times many times on the throat and that that that little was shivering shivering shivering the same thing for my lord as a type of my lord &gt;&gt; why didn't I have to die just suddenly no but they have to smite him they have to they have to afflict him they have to smite him so he could die could die shaking like that my lord &gt;&gt; make it on the cross for me for you. &gt;&gt; Thank you for your love. &gt;&gt; Thank you for your love. &gt;&gt; That my message this this evening just to remember what the Lord has done for us. &gt;&gt; There are many things we can say but there's nothing that can compare for what God has done for us. &gt;&gt; The Bible says wherefore seeing we also are compassed with so great a cloud of witnesses. Let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us. &gt;&gt; Let us run with patience the race that is set before us. &gt;&gt; Looking unto Jesus the author and finish our faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame as he was there put to shame mocked him and everything but he was looking to the joy set before him. Amen. That's why he could endure the cross. He was seeing when we will be together in the millennium. He could see when we will be together in eternity. He could see that I I can go through this suffering a little bit like Joseph. When Joseph realized, oh, I went through all this suffering because I God wanted to save my brothers and sisters. Jesus Christ realized the same thing. Oh, I'm willing to give my life. I'm willing to suffer because of my brothers and sisters, because of my cherished bride. Amen. He was thinking of you. He was thinking of me. Amen. We thank God for his grace. Aren't you thankful for God's grace in our life? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Prophet says God doesn't care about the lily on the altar. He wants you on the altar. &gt;&gt; It isn't the lily. It is your sacrifice. It isn't your sacrifice. You are the guy to be on the altar. That the difference putting what God requires on the altar is you. I'd rather worship a little in a little old room somewhere in a back alley and have God in it than a cathedral with God. not in need. That's right. Sure. &gt;&gt; He was a poor man. Notice that when he brought his offering candid and laid it upon them, they notice he came from the line of Satan because he expected God to receive it because it was beautiful fruits. Something that he done himself. But look at Abel. Not now when Abel came to make his offering. Well, it was quite a difference when Abel came. Here you come. He didn't work. didn't try to find the biggest church in town to go to. He didn't try to find the nicest bunch of people to associate with. Amen. He just took something that he had on and come on. That's all. He was a sheep herder. So he just reached over and got a lamp and tied. I suppose they didn't have any in that name. So he must have got a grave a grave a grape vine and just wrapped it around his neck. But what what did he speak of? They led him to Calvary. He was the lamb. when he was, why was he born in a barn? Lambs are not born in houses. They are born in barns. They led him, they led him to the slaughter like a lamp, and they led him away, leading him up to Calvary. He was God's lamp. Amen. From the foundation of the world. When I think of it, there came Abel's little lamp. They come God's lamp. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. the cruelty of sin and the penalty that it costs to read sin from our from from our lives. When I think of it, my heart just turns over and over. When I think me a poor, unworthy, ungodly sinner dying without God, with Christ in the world without hope and in due season, Christ died on mystead, the beautiful one, and became despised and rejected that I might be accepted in his sight. In mystead, oh my, I just can't get over it. I just can't imagine how he could do that for me. Who was I? Then you say, "Did he do it for you?" Says, "Yes." The Holy Spirit come and hunted me up one day and said, "God did it for you. Jesus did it for you." And I believed him. I believed him with all my heart. Oh, the lamb of God that he not die quickly. He had to suffer to take all that. Oh, I say now how he was wounded for our transgression, bruised for iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed. How could you reject suchless love? How could you reject that love of God for you? I trust tonight my brother, sister, that you will come. God was as a provided way. That's the way for you. That the only one who can have anything to do with you. That's the only one that took your place. that the one who stands tonight, the resurrected redeemer, standing at the right hand of the father tonight, see you begging and pleading for every sinner that in this building to come to him. I trust you will. I trust you won't let this Easter pass. That's my prayer. I trust that this Easter will just not be like any other Easter, but we can go with the right attitude. Lord, &gt;&gt; make me make me realize the value of Calvary. Make me realize what you have done for me. Say, dear friends, we are the end of the road. I believe we are. We've all we are down to the end of the road. May the Lord Jesus Christ bless you. May you make you a new creature in him tonight is my prayer. May he lead you one time. &gt;&gt; One time in. Amen. Is that the desire of your heart? May God lead us. May you God continue to continue with us. Amen. See, are you willing like it was for Abel? Are you willing tonight to die upon yourself? Are you willing to die out all your thought of yourself as Abel had to die with the sacrifice there as he was seeing the shivering of that dying lamb and himself later on he died on that same altar. He died with that lamb. The same thing for us. We desire to be identified in death of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. desire to die to my pride, to die to my arrogance, to die to my or to to die for anything that that that is not of God. I want to die to all those things. And I want the life of Jesus Christ to come upon me. The lamb of of Abel could not the life of the lamb of Abel could not come upon Abel, but the life of the perfect lamb of God can come upon us. Amen. That's what we desire. Prophet says, just lay on the rock with your lamp there and die out. Oh God have mercy. When I think of men of women who think who think of pride, young men and women who will give their lives over to the things. Oh, men of age too thinking of their job and their prestige and of their neighborhood or something like that. Oh, you might say it's a funeral. Well, brother, if there ever was a time we needed a funeral is right now when men will die to their self and pride. Oh God, we desire to die to ourselves. &gt;&gt; We can have life in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, when the skies begin to get dark, lightning begin to flash, God was hiding his face, he couldn't stand it no more. Oh God, how cruel sin must be. How cruel, how cruel that caused that precious one to do that. Even such a price he paid till God himself hid his face. The angel veiled their faces and to weeping with him. The moon and the stars could not go any further. They could not shine no more. The very God that created them was dying on the cross. He bowed his head. Before he did that, he looked down there to them people grumbling for his garment fulfilled what the prophet said and he said, "Father, forgive them. They don't know what they are doing." All in love, Adam's lamb, God provided lamb, slain from the foundation of the world. There he died friend, friendless, friendless, even forsaken by God himself. Oh, his own father forsaken bleeding. He died on the cross and the blood can cleanse us today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that your desire? God may continue to clean me. Clean me. Oh, what did cost God never cost us nothing. But cost God his son. It cost God the greatest price. It cost Christ his life. He was the rose of Sharon. But to get the perfume out of a rose, you have to crush it up. Oh, his beautiful life was crushed. He was crushed. Completely crushed. to take that rose of of Sharon and that can be applied upon us who are stinking in in sin and trespasses and iniquities so that that perfume can be applied upon us and we can come in the presence of God and now with confidence oh God you don't look at my sins but you look at your own blood I can come in prayer and say Lord you know my petitions because it's not me anymore it's the blood of Jesus Christ oh praise be to God say by the which we shall all sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all amen we don't have to do many sacrifices one sacrifice was more than enough to cleanse us all to cleanse you to clean you to cleanse me that the blood of Jesus Christ brothers and sisters we don't have come always with condemnation now we can come because we don't look at ourself look at the at the lamb of God as we go to the high priest system. He doesn't look at this. The worshipper looks at the perfect lamb. If the lamb is perfect, then the worshipper is perfect. Amen. So that's why we can come with confidence with God this evening. &gt;&gt; And claim may the redemptive blessings of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I thank you for what you have done for me. I consecrate myself and you at this crucifixion night memorial to you. Take me Lord, forgive me all my mistakes and troubles. Make me strong and powerful Lord in the spirit of God that I might win souls to you. &gt;&gt; Bless this congregation for we ask it in Jesus name. Forgive every sinner. Reclaim every backslider that they desire our heart. We have families sometimes split and people backsliding. Oh God remember us this evening. Remember our cry, remember our prayer. Lord, may you go and touch in each and every one of them. Father, &gt;&gt; as we remember of Calvary, remember what Calvary has done for us. And brother Bam says, what can we do if we understand what Calvary means for us? The first thing I want to say, Jesus never lived for himself. His life was spent for others. That's perfectly eternal life. When you say you go to church and do good things, that's fine. But when you leave your life to yourself, you haven't eternal life. Eternal life is living for others. Living for it. proved it when he came the lamb of God. He lived and had eternal life because he did not leave for himself. He lived for others. &gt;&gt; As we are, we are going to go in prayer in few minutes. Remember also those those who couldn't make it, those who don't even realize that they need God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can pray for them this evening once we have that revelation of what cross has done for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 5:15. and he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again that's why we don't own ourself we have been bought with a prize we pertain to him belong to him first John 3:16 hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren remember the brethrens in prayer prayer this evening as we go in prayers.
