[43:37] Isn't it good to be in the church?
[43:40] &gt;&gt; Isn't good to be a Christian?
[43:43] &gt;&gt; We can also have good times.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; It's not only for the world. We can also
[43:47] have the real good time in the presence
[43:49] of the Lord
[43:51] &gt;&gt; because we have a sure and certain
[43:53] promise. and we should rejoice in it.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Thank God for that.
[43:59] Thank you, brother. God bless you
[44:00] richly. And uh we it start by becoming
[44:05] your second church, home church and then

[44:18] that. God bless you. Thank God for the

[44:30] to invite the word of God now as we
[44:33] invite brother John Manassi
[44:37] Manassi come. They both very good
[44:39] friends. It's good to have a minister
[44:41] who's who's going around with his song
[44:44] leader. Isn't that wonderful?
[44:47] I should go with brother Andrews
[44:49] wherever I'm going. So this time God
[44:51] will really I'm going to India by myself

[44:54] leader
[44:56] then it will be wonderful [laughter]
[44:59] just wonderful like God bless you
[45:01] richly. So invite brother Jean Manassi
[45:04] and he's a wonderful minister and uh he
[45:08] classifies himself on the young side and
[45:11] but is just the word is not young. The
[45:14] word is fresh and
[45:16] &gt;&gt; as good as comes from elders pastor Zeke
[45:20] can come al from the younger one but
[45:22] still the word of God. Amen pastor Zeke.
[45:25] Right. [laughter]
[45:26] And uh so we appreciate just pull on the
[45:29] word of God and uh you know we have
[45:32] heard about the revival in Gloverdale.
[45:34] Have you ever heard about the revival in
[45:36] Crodale and the young people and so and
[45:40] one that God used it was brother Jean.
[45:44] So God used tremendously for that
[45:46] revival in Cro at some point. So and God
[45:50] continued to use him and we appreciate
[45:52] the gift. So that's why I asked the
[45:54] young people if he could stay for I
[45:55] didn't warn him but I'm warning him now.
[45:58] So I will be preaching. He might think
[45:59] what he might tell the young people
[46:01] after the service just for 15 minutes.
[46:04] He just give his testimony of how God
[46:07] used him for that revival and then we
[46:10] can stay with that and then we can we
[46:12] can we can share. So that's why I called
[46:14] the urgent emergency youth meeting after
[46:17] the service just for 15 minutes just to
[46:19] hear his testimony that might help us as
[46:22] we as we stay behind and so we welcome
[46:26] him and and the word of God is going to
[46:29] use him as a way of com of announcement
[46:32] just don't want to break the service but
[46:34] the anointing but father Victor is

[50:35] &gt;&gt; I believe [music]
[50:39] all things [singing]
[50:42] are possible, [music]
[50:45] &gt;&gt; Lord. I [singing]
[50:48] believe.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Do you believe tonight this morning?
[50:53] Amen. Why
[50:54] &gt;&gt; don't you lift up your hand as we go to
[50:55] him in prayer?
[50:58] Heavenly Father, Lord, with this
[51:00] confession upon our lips, we want to say
[51:03] more than words, Lord, more than a song.
[51:05] It's a reality in our souls.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Lord, we believe.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; We believe your word, Lord. We believe
[51:12] every promise in this book is ours. We
[51:16] believe that when you say something, it
[51:17] will come to pass. We believe that even
[51:20] though it may take a week, a month, a
[51:22] year, or 10 years, it does not matter.
[51:24] It will happen. We believe your word for
[51:26] we are believers. Believers always
[51:30] believe no matter what. No matter what
[51:32] the opposition is, no matter what the
[51:33] circumstances are, we believe in your
[51:36] word.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; So we invite you this morning, Holy
[51:39] Spirit, as we sense your nearness
[51:40] already. We say, "Have your way this
[51:42] morning, Father. Your will be done.
[51:45] Speak to our hearts your word, Father.
[51:47] And Lord, may you be pleased, oh God.
[51:49] Because without faith, it's impossible
[51:51] to please God. But I pray, Father, that
[51:54] this morning, you will impart revelation
[51:56] to our hearts. That when we leave this
[51:58] place, Lord, we will know you in a
[52:00] better way, Lord. In a greater way,
[52:02] Father, and each one of us can say at
[52:04] the end of the service, I love him more
[52:06] &gt;&gt; than when I first came to church.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; We commit the reading of the word, the
[52:10] preaching of the word, the hearing of
[52:11] the word into your hands in the name of
[52:14] Jesus. Amen.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; And the church says,
[52:18] &gt;&gt; amen.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. I'm brother Jean,
[52:22] not brother Risa, brother Jean.
[52:26] I am from Bible way as you know. Um,
[52:28] happy to be here. This is my first time
[52:30] in this church. I've been in Edmonton
[52:31] before, but this is my first time here.
[52:32] So, thank you, brother Moyes, for the
[52:34] invitation. Uh, Brother Zeke. I just
[52:38] pleased to be here.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; I trust something we'll be say this
[52:41] morning that will that will be a
[52:43] blessing to you. Amen.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; If I can preach as as good as brother
[52:47] Ray sang,
[52:49] &gt;&gt; then I know we're going to have church.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; So you help him. You help him sing. So
[52:54] help me preach. And
[52:55] &gt;&gt; if 10 minutes in the service, uh, I
[52:58] might call him back. So brother V, just
[53:00] come and sing.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; But you love the word.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can sing. But the word is the
[53:05] most important thing.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; Right.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; So we will turn into the Bible. We will
[53:11] go in the book of Genesis chapter 3.
[53:13] That's where I'm going to start. We will
[53:16] also read in Galatians 3 after that. But
[53:18] let's start with Genesis 3 verse 6-9.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Are you there? Amen.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; And when the woman saw that the tree was
[53:37] good for food, and that it was pleasant
[53:39] to the eyes, and the tree to be desired
[53:41] to make one wise, she took the fruit
[53:43] thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto
[53:46] her husband with her, and he did eat.
[53:48] And the eyes of them both were open, and
[53:51] they knew they were naked. If people
[53:54] were sincere, when they read the Bible,
[53:55] they'll understand that this is not a
[53:57] fruit, right? How do you eat a fruit and
[53:59] realize you're naked? I mean, it
[54:02] shouldn't even require revelation, but
[54:03] it does require revelation.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; And he said, "And they s fig leaves
[54:08] together and made themselves aprons. And
[54:10] they heard the voice of the Lord God
[54:12] walking in the garden of Eden in the
[54:13] cool of the day. And Adam and his wife
[54:16] hid themselves from the presence of the
[54:18] Lord God amongst the trees of the
[54:20] garden. And the Lord God called unto
[54:22] Adam, and said unto him, where art
[54:25] thou?" Amen.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Uh let's also just jump to 23.
[54:31] Verse 23. Therefore the Lord God sent
[54:33] him forth from the garden of Eden to
[54:35] till the ground from whence he was
[54:37] taken. So he drove out the man and he
[54:40] placed at the east of the garden of Eden
[54:42] cherubams and the flaming sword which
[54:44] turned every way to keep the way of the
[54:47] tree of life. I'm so glad this is not
[54:49] all there is to the Bible
[54:51] &gt;&gt; because if this is where the Bible
[54:52] ended, you and I will be in trouble. But
[54:55] there's 65 books after where God now
[54:58] shows us the plan that he devised to
[55:00] reverse this picture we just read.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; So that where once man was driven out of
[55:04] Eden, now he's driven to Eden.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; All right, let's go now in book of
[55:10] Galatians chapter 3
[55:14] verse 13 to 14. Galatians 3 13-4. Christ
[55:20] have redeemed us from the curse of the
[55:22] law being made curse for us.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Strange, right? He has redeemed us from
[55:29] the curse. But the way he did that, he
[55:32] himself had to be made a curse.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; And it says cursed is everyone that
[55:38] hangeth from the tree that the blessing
[55:40] of Abraham might come unto the Gentiles
[55:43] through Jesus Christ that we might
[55:44] receive the promise of the spirit
[55:46] through faith. So the only way the
[55:49] blessings of Abraham will come to the
[55:51] Gentiles was for Christ to become a
[55:53] curse. So out of a curse came a
[55:57] blessing.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. All
[55:58] &gt;&gt; right. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we
[56:01] pray now, Lord, that you'll take your
[56:02] word, Father. The prophet has told us
[56:05] multiple times, any man who knows how to
[56:07] read can read this Bible.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; But it takes the Holy Spirit, Lord, to
[56:11] make it come alive. Lord, if God doesn't
[56:14] take the words that we just read and
[56:16] quickens it to our heart, this is in
[56:18] vain. This meaning will be in vain. All
[56:20] these words will be said in vain. But
[56:21] when he comes and he takes a word,
[56:24] sometimes not even an entire sentence,
[56:26] sometimes just one word from God is
[56:28] enough
[56:29] &gt;&gt; to change our lives. Lord,
[56:31] &gt;&gt; come by our way now this morning in
[56:33] Jesus name. Amen.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Man, you may be seated or you can stand
[56:37] the whole service if you want to. I'll
[56:40] be standing.
[56:43] Can I make myself comfortable?
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Can I Can I Can I feel at home?
[56:47] &gt;&gt; All right. If I don't come back, then
[56:50] you know what happened.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; I bring you greetings from our church.
[56:56] Clo the Bible way on the sensor wanted
[56:58] me to pass my greetings here.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; All right. We can enjoy ourselves this
[57:03] morning.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; I love what brother Moses says. We also
[57:06] have a right to have a good time. You
[57:09] know, church is not always just solemn.
[57:11] It's like we're not Catholics. We don't
[57:13] come here wearing robes and we're like
[57:15] so dignified.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; God is our father.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; This is his house.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; So, this is home.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; We are at home. We should be able to
[57:23] enjoy ourselves
[57:24] &gt;&gt; because we're living in the most
[57:26] glorious time that there is in the story
[57:28] of redemption.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; This is more glorious than the days of
[57:31] Paul.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; This is more glorious than the days of
[57:35] Jesus Christ in the flesh. You're like,
[57:38] "Whoa, is it?" Yes, it is. Because
[57:40] Christ died on Calvary for you.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; So that in this last days, the title did
[57:46] that was lost in Eden,
[57:48] &gt;&gt; what Adam lost could be restored back to
[57:50] man.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; What we just read here in Genesis 3,
[57:53] Berlin describes this as one of the
[57:55] saddest scenes in the entire Bible.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Where God is now kicking out of Eden his
[58:01] own family.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Think about that. Think about being a
[58:06] father and because of something that
[58:07] your children did and you drive all of
[58:09] them out.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; That's what essentially God did. Says we
[58:13] can't leave no together. You have to
[58:14] leave Eden.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; And not only did he kick them out, he
[58:18] now blocked the way back.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Like this is really picturing this is de
[58:23] portraying your a great uh separation
[58:25] now between God and man. You know, maybe
[58:27] Adam could sneak back in. God is like,
[58:29] "No, I'm making sure you're not coming
[58:31] back. I want you to understand the
[58:33] gravity of what you did.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; And God wasn't enjoying himself and
[58:37] smiling and happy when he did this. This
[58:38] was something that broke his heart
[58:40] &gt;&gt; to drive his family away. You know, I
[58:43] love how Brother Bam describes this
[58:44] scene. He says, as he was driving them
[58:47] away, he says, "All of a sudden, I see
[58:50] the Holy Spirit coming down in the
[58:51] funnel." And it says, "And he spelled
[58:53] those words L O V E, love." And then God
[58:57] said, "Wait,
[58:59] &gt;&gt; I will put enmity between your seed
[59:01] &gt;&gt; and the serpent seed." Just as he was
[59:03] driving them out, wait. Here's a
[59:05] promise.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; I will make a way for you to come back.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; And that's the heart of God. The heart
[59:10] of God is no matter what you do in your
[59:12] life, no matter what your sins are, you
[59:14] might feel the distance between you and
[59:16] him says, "Wait, I have a plan to bring
[59:19] you back."
[59:20] &gt;&gt; And God is always going to go after his
[59:22] own. Yes.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; If you're a seed of God, you can never
[59:25] hide away from God.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; You can run, but everywhere you go, God
[59:29] is.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; David called this revelation once and
[59:32] said, "Even if I lay my bed in hell,
[59:34] behold, he's there.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Where can I go?
[59:38] &gt;&gt; There's nowhere you can go where God is
[59:40] not there."
[59:41] &gt;&gt; You know why? BECAUSE GOD IS not around
[59:43] you.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; God is in you.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Even in your sinful form, the
[59:50] predestinated seed is a part of God.
[59:52] Amen.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; SO NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO, YOU ALWAYS GO
[59:55] WITH GOD.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; So you cannot escape him. God doesn't
[59:59] have to RUN AND FIND YOU. HE'S always
[1:00:00] there.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; You can say, "I'm not coming to church
[1:00:03] anymore. I'm just going to go far in the
[1:00:05] world and do whatever I want." He's
[1:00:06] there.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; You cannot escape him. You're a part of
[1:00:11] him.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; You might as well just deal with it.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; So this is the saddest scene in the
[1:00:18] Bible year where Adam and Eve are kicked
[1:00:20] out of Eden. for rejecting the word.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; And then we see in Revelation chapter 3
[1:00:26] where Christ is kicked out of the
[1:00:28] church,
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; right? Because the church rejected the
[1:00:32] word.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; And these are also both of them are the
[1:00:35] most saddest scenes in the entire Bible.
[1:00:37] Bible says imagine that Christ is kicked
[1:00:39] out of his own church.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; So if in Eden God made a way, he started
[1:00:46] making a way to bring men back. Amen.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; So surely Leodysia, he will make a way
[1:00:52] to bring the word back in the church
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; because the word the church rejected the
[1:00:57] word and kicked him out. But God was
[1:00:59] going to devise a plan and he was going
[1:01:01] to open up the word to call out the
[1:01:04] elect of God and make his way back in
[1:01:07] the church.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; He's in his bride
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; because this bride did not reject the
[1:01:13] word. This bride has been called out
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; by the word.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Now, let me just lay a foundation as
[1:01:21] we're going through our thoughts. The
[1:01:23] prophet of God tells us that in the
[1:01:25] beginning, before the beginning, God was
[1:01:28] Elohim.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; He says, "Ela, Elohim, the self-existing
[1:01:32] one." And he could not make himself
[1:01:34] known unto us in this form. The
[1:01:36] prophecy, it was too mysterious. We
[1:01:39] could not comprehend this God who fills
[1:01:41] all space and time, who does not have a
[1:01:43] beginning, who does not have an end,
[1:01:45] who's a self-existing one. Nobody could
[1:01:47] really comprehend that. But in God,
[1:01:50] brother say the way to think about this
[1:01:52] is the purest fountain of love.
[1:01:56] I love that because too many times our
[1:02:00] relationship with God or at least the
[1:02:02] way we view God is so misconstrued
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; and we think of God as this God of
[1:02:08] judgment and righteousness and justice
[1:02:10] who punishes sin and who's this like YOU
[1:02:13] TOLD THE LIE. This is my word. you
[1:02:15] follow I oh it's a curse sometimes
[1:02:17] that's how we think about God but the
[1:02:19] prophet is set in the record straight
[1:02:20] here the way to think about God is that
[1:02:22] he was the purest fountain of love
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; so God is love
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; his entire relationship with us is based
[1:02:30] on love
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; it's not based on laws it's not based on
[1:02:35] dos and don'ts based on love
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; and love is not a feeling
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; right agapu is not a feelingo
[1:02:44] is a feeling.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; The love that I have for my brother, my
[1:02:47] sister, for my of my children, that's
[1:02:48] felio. And my feelings can get hurt.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; But love agapo is a being.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; It's a person.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; God is love.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; It's not that God has love.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; It's that God is love.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; God is not a being who happens to have
[1:03:09] feelings of love for us. God is the very
[1:03:12] essence of love. He is a fountain of
[1:03:16] love.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; How many believe that?
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; So then in this fountain of love were
[1:03:23] many attributes. The prophet says in him
[1:03:26] was the attribute of a savior.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; In him was an attribute of God.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; In him was an attribute of a healer. In
[1:03:35] him wants to be a keeper, to be a
[1:03:37] protector, to be a deliverer, to be a
[1:03:38] savior, to be a provider, to be your
[1:03:41] peace.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; In him were all these attributes.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; But this attributes lay dormant. Now the
[1:03:48] word dormant means temporarily inactive,
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; right? Temporarily. Something is
[1:03:54] dormant, it can be awakened.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; And you'll find that even in genetics,
[1:03:58] there might be a dormant gene and that
[1:04:01] gets passed around from generation to
[1:04:02] generation. And at some point it gets
[1:04:04] activated.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; You're like, "Oh, where did this come
[1:04:06] from?" It was always there
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; laying dormant.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; And it took circumstances to activate
[1:04:11] the gene that was dormant.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; So the genes and attributes of God were
[1:04:16] laying dormant.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; I'm going somewhere.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; And these genes were laying dormant in
[1:04:21] God. But it was going to take something
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; to activate what was dormant to
[1:04:28] implement those genes and put them to
[1:04:30] action. What good would it be for God to
[1:04:32] be a savior when there was nobody to
[1:04:34] save?
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; What good would it do for him to be a
[1:04:38] healer if there was nobody to heal?
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; What's the point of buying a car if
[1:04:42] nobody's going to drive it?
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; You're just going to leave it in the
[1:04:44] garage and just park it. So, some of
[1:04:46] these attributes would have been parked
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; in Elohim
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; and it just left there
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; and they were just there without purpose
[1:04:55] because there's no way to make use of
[1:04:57] them. So Elohim dwelt by himself with
[1:05:00] himself with all his attributes in
[1:05:02] himself in the thick darkness for
[1:05:05] thousand and millions and billions and
[1:05:07] trillions of years because he has no
[1:05:09] beginning and those attributes did
[1:05:12] nothing
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; but he was there. So then he devises a
[1:05:16] plan and it will express what's in me.
[1:05:20] And then the first thing that God does
[1:05:22] say that he created angels,
[1:05:25] right? So let me just read a quote here.
[1:05:27] He says, watch carefully now and see
[1:05:30] this. Before there was ever a speck of
[1:05:33] stardust, before God was God, God is an
[1:05:37] object of adoration and no one was there
[1:05:39] to worship him. So at that time only he
[1:05:43] was potentially
[1:05:45] God.
[1:05:47] So when Elohim existed by himself, he
[1:05:50] wasn't really God.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; He was potentially God.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; My title this morning is Elohim's
[1:05:57] potentials.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; He was potentially
[1:06:01] God. And he was known only as a eternal
[1:06:04] spirit. And the bride was already in his
[1:06:07] mind. Yes, she was. She was existing in
[1:06:09] his thoughts. And what about those
[1:06:10] thoughts of God? They are eternal. So we
[1:06:13] see that God was only potentially God.
[1:06:16] He was Elohim. And I can take this quote
[1:06:18] and run with it and say he was only
[1:06:19] potentially a savior.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; He was potentially a healer.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; He was potentially a deliverer. All of
[1:06:28] these were potentials
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; in him. But he wasn't quite those
[1:06:33] things.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Elohim wasn't quite God yet. He was
[1:06:38] potentially God. So then to realize his
[1:06:41] potential, what would he do? Now the
[1:06:44] word potential here means latent
[1:06:46] qualities or abilities that will have to
[1:06:50] be developed in the future for
[1:06:52] usefulness.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Unless they are developed, they are not
[1:06:56] useful.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; And another definition here is the
[1:07:00] possibility of something of someone
[1:07:03] being able to do something. So he had
[1:07:05] the ability the latent quality to do
[1:07:09] something. Now the prophet says now all
[1:07:12] we are today here is a display of his
[1:07:14] attributes. First he was not even God.
[1:07:17] We will call him the eternal one. He
[1:07:19] wasn't God because the word God means
[1:07:22] object of worship and there was nothing
[1:07:25] to worship him. So he was just the
[1:07:27] eternal one. The main fountain of all
[1:07:29] intelligence. And in this fountain of
[1:07:32] all intelligence, there was not even an
[1:07:34] atom or a molecule or nothing light
[1:07:36] nowhere, no star, no moon, nothing else.
[1:07:39] God, what we know as God, the great
[1:07:42] spirit that was eternal that never did
[1:07:44] begin and never will end. He was there
[1:07:47] and in him was attributes, attributes to
[1:07:50] be God.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:52] Then his attributes to be a father, to
[1:07:55] be a son, to be a savior, to be a
[1:07:57] healer, all of these attributes was in
[1:08:00] him. And these things that was unfolded
[1:08:03] since then are just his attributes being
[1:08:06] made manifest. Now the entire plan of
[1:08:09] redemption, the unfolding of God is his
[1:08:11] attributes being made manifest.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; What I mean by attributes, I mean
[1:08:16] thoughts. And a word is a thought
[1:08:19] expressed. And then that was in his
[1:08:22] thinking. And then he said, "Let there
[1:08:24] be and there was." And now remember you
[1:08:27] Christians were his thoughts before
[1:08:30] there was a world.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; And you are the manifestation
[1:08:36] of his thinking.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; My think about that. That's powerful.
[1:08:40] You were his thoughts before the
[1:08:42] beginning.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; And those thoughts were tangible. They
[1:08:44] were real. And then you came into time
[1:08:46] as the manifestation of what God was
[1:08:49] thinking.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; So if you want to know God's thoughts,
[1:08:52] you look at the bride.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; When I see you, I see what he was
[1:08:57] actually thinking
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; before he created because you were his
[1:09:01] thoughts.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Now he says
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; before there even was the world, you
[1:09:05] were in Christ and God in the beginning.
[1:09:07] That makes you his subjects and the
[1:09:09] whole thing is God himself materializing
[1:09:11] himself tangible. So he could be
[1:09:15] handled. Oh my. God that was invisible.
[1:09:19] God that existed by himself. God that no
[1:09:22] man could see devis a plan to condescend
[1:09:24] into time so he could be handled.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; And touched so he could be seen.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Now he says now God's secret mystery out
[1:09:35] of Christ the mystery of God revealed
[1:09:37] that he had before the word began. Now
[1:09:38] back in the back part of God's mind. I
[1:09:42] remember as brother Moses mentioned this
[1:09:44] uh during uh what we call like the SFA
[1:09:46] revival when I was in university. I was
[1:09:49] sharing this with somebody one of the
[1:09:50] students university. I said God in the
[1:09:53] back part of his mind what God wanted to
[1:09:55] do and she paused me. She said wait how
[1:09:57] do you know what God was thinking?
[1:10:00] Then I realized Maya like perhaps you
[1:10:03] don't really appreciate what the message
[1:10:04] is like for her this blew her mind. that
[1:10:08] I had the courage to tell her what God
[1:10:10] was thinking.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; They don't know these things but by the
[1:10:13] opening of the word
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; because you have received a message in
[1:10:17] these last days. You know the thoughts
[1:10:19] of God.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Don't sleep on this. Don't take this as
[1:10:23] casually. You got to appreciate what the
[1:10:25] message is.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; It's the opening or the revelation of
[1:10:29] the thoughts of God.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; When we say that the seals are open,
[1:10:33] what are we meaning?
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; It's not just symbolism. white horse
[1:10:37] rider, pale horse rider. NO, THE OPENING
[1:10:39] OF THE word is a revelation of God's
[1:10:42] thinking.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; We did not really understand what God
[1:10:46] thought about us
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; until the sins were open and now we
[1:10:50] understood his thinking.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; That's what the book is all about is God
[1:10:54] making known unto us his thoughts.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; And then the prophet can stand and say,
[1:10:58] I will tell you what was in the back
[1:11:00] part of his mind.
[1:11:05] Oh my. Only the bride knows these
[1:11:07] things.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; But now he's about to tell us. Do you
[1:11:09] want to know what was in the backbone of
[1:11:11] his mind?
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; He had a motive in doing this in order
[1:11:15] to let himself be expressed.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; There wasn't even a moon, a star, and an
[1:11:20] atom and a molecule. He was God, but he
[1:11:22] wasn't exactly God because God is an
[1:11:24] object of worship and there was nothing
[1:11:25] to worship him. And in his great mind,
[1:11:29] he wanted these attributes to be
[1:11:31] expressed.
[1:11:33] And in him was love, was father, was
[1:11:36] son, was to be a savior. In him was to
[1:11:38] be a healer. And all these great
[1:11:39] attributes that we see expressed today,
[1:11:42] they were once in God. Now he says, "So
[1:11:44] my opinion, the first thing that he made
[1:11:47] was angels." Now listen to this. This is
[1:11:50] very important here. And it says, "And
[1:11:53] then they angels worshiped him and that
[1:11:58] made him God."
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:02] And then he started from there. Okay,
[1:12:04] let's pause here. I personally when I
[1:12:07] read the prophet, I like to really
[1:12:10] understand what he's saying.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes you listen to a tape
[1:12:14] and brother Brandham, there's nobody who
[1:12:15] could preach like brother in one
[1:12:17] paragraph he will say three or four
[1:12:19] sentences there that you can preach for
[1:12:22] five years and then he moves on to
[1:12:24] something else like he just didn't drop
[1:12:25] a bomb. [snorts] Like h how do you just
[1:12:28] say that the angels worship him and that
[1:12:32] if you want to underline that that
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; made him God?
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; What is he saying here? That Elohim was
[1:12:40] only potentially God.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; And then that potential was realized
[1:12:46] when there was somebody to worship him.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Once he created angels, the attribute of
[1:12:53] God that was dormant was awakened. And
[1:12:56] now he realized that potential. He was
[1:12:59] no longer potentially God. HE BECAME
[1:13:02] GOD.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; HE [screaming] ACTUALLY BECAME GOD.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Now when you talk about potentials, you
[1:13:10] can talk about a young man and say, "I
[1:13:12] see a lot of potentials in you
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; and and you would hate to see those
[1:13:15] potentials go to waste."
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; So then you want that that young man to
[1:13:18] apply himself so he can actually become
[1:13:21] all that he's able to become. Amen.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; He has a potential to become, but he
[1:13:27] needs to do something so he becomes.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Every male has a potential to be a
[1:13:31] father.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Every female here has a potential to be
[1:13:34] a mother. BUT WHEN IT ACTUALLY happens
[1:13:36] when you have a baby, that baby makes
[1:13:40] you dad.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; That baby makes you mom.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going somewhere.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; So these attributes, angels made him
[1:13:49] God. Amen.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; He could not be God unless someone was
[1:13:54] going to worship him.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; And when they worship him, they realized
[1:13:59] that attribute. It came alive.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; And brother says he started from there.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; That's where he started. He's like,
[1:14:06] "Okay, now one of them is alive. One of
[1:14:08] them got activated.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; I have made him to activate it."
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; So God's motive and objective in
[1:14:17] creation was to express his attributes
[1:14:19] to express his full potential
[1:14:22] and that made him go when the angels
[1:14:25] worship him. And then the next thing God
[1:14:28] does now is create man.
[1:14:32] He makes Adam and then he says it is not
[1:14:36] good for man to be alone.
[1:14:39] So I'm going to make him a helpmate. And
[1:14:41] now God for the first time on the earth
[1:14:44] has a family.
[1:14:46] He has a son and his daughter. He wanted
[1:14:49] to be a father. Now he did it.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Now Adam and Eve made him father
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; the same way angels made him God.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; And now God and father this attributes
[1:15:03] are now quickened. And now God has a
[1:15:06] family on earth. All the thrill. Oh what
[1:15:09] joy that was. Imagine the joy of God in
[1:15:12] his soul. HE SAYS, "I HAVE A family
[1:15:15] now."
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; You know, it's such a joy when you
[1:15:19] actually accomplish the purpose that you
[1:15:21] had in your heart.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; And when you think about it, you say,
[1:15:24] "Okay, one day I'm going to build this
[1:15:26] house. It's going to be like this. It's
[1:15:27] going to be this. It's going to this
[1:15:28] many rooms." And you ponder on this. And
[1:15:29] you plan and you devise it and then you
[1:15:31] see it.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; It's such a joy to see your thinking
[1:15:35] made manifest.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; These were the things that I was
[1:15:38] thinking about. I WANTED TO HAVE A
[1:15:40] FAMILY. I wanted to be a father. Now I
[1:15:43] have children.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Says, but you know, it began to get
[1:15:47] evening time and the sun was setting and
[1:15:50] Adam said, "Sweetheart, we must go up to
[1:15:52] the cathedral. We've got to go worship."
[1:15:54] It wasn't a denomination. It was in a
[1:15:57] great big forest. They went up and knelt
[1:15:59] down at the sun. As the sun was going
[1:16:01] down and father came down,
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; the lightnings flashed, the thunders
[1:16:07] rolled and a beautiful majestic light
[1:16:09] sailed over the bushes and it come down.
[1:16:12] I can hear the loving voice of the
[1:16:14] father say, "Children, have you enjoyed
[1:16:16] yourself today?"
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Papa has come to kiss you good night and
[1:16:20] lay you down for the night and the kiss
[1:16:22] upon the cheek of Adam and the kiss upon
[1:16:23] the cheek of Eve. Now think about this
[1:16:26] now. The relationship that Adam and Eve
[1:16:29] have with God is greater than the one
[1:16:32] angels have with God.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Because Adam and Eve now know God in a
[1:16:39] greater way than the angels.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Because to the angels, he was only an
[1:16:45] object of worship.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; That's all they knew. They were created
[1:16:48] to worship him. To the angels, God was
[1:16:51] the one you worship. To Adam and Eve, he
[1:16:54] was that and more.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; To Adam and Eve, he was an object of
[1:16:59] worship, but he was also papa,
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; daddy,
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; father.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Right? So, for the first time here,
[1:17:08] there was a creature on earth that
[1:17:10] called God
[1:17:14] to God. For the angels, he was God.
[1:17:18] Holy, holy is the Lord God. God is holy.
[1:17:20] God is no like God, God, God, God. to
[1:17:22] Adam and Eve. He was dad.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; That's a different relationship. He's
[1:17:27] not just my God. He's my father.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; And that relationship that Adam and Eve
[1:17:33] had with God, the angels did not have.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; So to Adam and Eve, God expressed more
[1:17:39] attributes
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; than he did to the angels.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:17:46] So when he created man in Adam were also
[1:17:49] attributes
[1:17:51] in Adam was attribute to be a husband
[1:17:56] was an attribute to be a father was all
[1:17:59] these attributes but they also laid
[1:18:02] dormant just like God's attributes laid
[1:18:05] dormant in God Adam's attributes lay
[1:18:07] dormant in him
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; but God wanted Adam to also express his
[1:18:14] attributes
[1:18:15] And the only way for Adam to express
[1:18:18] express all his attributes was for God
[1:18:21] to give him a helpmate
[1:18:23] because he could not be a father unless
[1:18:26] he had a wife. He couldn't be a wife
[1:18:28] unless there was a female that God
[1:18:30] created to give it to him. Right? So
[1:18:31] then God gave Adam a vessel, a helpmate,
[1:18:36] a bride, a wife, so that through her he
[1:18:41] can actualize all his potentials. So
[1:18:44] that through Eve, Adam can actually be
[1:18:46] all that he can be.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; You following me so far?
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; All right. So the only way for Adam to
[1:18:53] express all of this was for Adam to have
[1:18:56] a helpmate. And God laid a law in Eden,
[1:18:59] the law of the seed here. As you know
[1:19:01] this, when he put the seed in the earth,
[1:19:03] the seed can only come forth with the
[1:19:05] power of life within it to transform it
[1:19:07] from a seed to a plant or whatever it
[1:19:09] was. He's transforming power. Now, God
[1:19:11] put the seed in there with potentials
[1:19:14] that it would be what he said it would
[1:19:17] be.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; You can rest assure that that every
[1:19:21] single seed will be what God said
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; it will be.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Every seed that has the potentials in it
[1:19:29] will be quickened to bring forth what
[1:19:31] God said it will be. If you're a seed of
[1:19:34] God, in you lays the power to be all
[1:19:38] that God has called you to be.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; The power TO BE A SON OF GOD DOESN'T
[1:19:43] come from elsewhere.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; The power to be a son comes from within.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Cuz God cannot take eternal life and
[1:19:52] take it out and bring it in you. There's
[1:19:54] already eternal life in you potentially
[1:19:56] in seed form. And when it gets
[1:19:59] quickened, that's where the new birth
[1:20:00] is. Amen.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; The new birth doesn't make you son of
[1:20:03] God.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Brother says, "When did you become a
[1:20:06] son? The night you got saved?" No,
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; you don't become a son of God because
[1:20:10] you gave your heart to the Lord.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; No, you give your heart to the Lord
[1:20:14] because you always were a son of God,
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; right? Because only the elect can be
[1:20:20] reborn.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; You You don't become seed when you get
[1:20:24] THE HOLY GHOST. BECAUSE YOU ARE SEED,
[1:20:27] you get the HOLY GHOST. THAT'S WHY YOU
[1:20:30] GET THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Rest in peace. That's what people
[1:20:34] sometimes they strive like I need to get
[1:20:35] the Holy Ghost and I. It's not by your
[1:20:37] might or by your power. The Holy Ghost
[1:20:40] is a consequence
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; of being seed.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; If you are seed in these last days, you
[1:20:45] will have the HOLY GHOST.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; YOU WILL GET IT.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; I was reading brother Brandham, I think
[1:20:50] it was in the church book and you was
[1:20:52] talking about how can I overcome? And it
[1:20:53] says that she is a word bride. It says
[1:20:56] and she conquers all things. I think
[1:20:58] that's how he says it. And as I was
[1:21:00] reading it, it strike me because the
[1:21:02] Bible says, "To him that will overcome.
[1:21:04] To him that will overcome. To him that
[1:21:06] will overcome."
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; And then sometimes overcoming can become
[1:21:09] the goal.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Okay? I have to overcome. That's the
[1:21:12] goal.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Then I realized overcoming is not the
[1:21:14] goal, it's a consequence.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; The goal is for the bride to be the
[1:21:19] word.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Cuz if the bride is the word, as a
[1:21:23] consequence, she overcomes.
[1:21:26] So sometimes we focus on the wrong
[1:21:28] thing. I need to overcome. No, feed on
[1:21:30] the word.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Become the word. And if the word lives
[1:21:33] in you, that word will overcome. And
[1:21:36] overcoming will become a result of the
[1:21:39] word that's in you.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; There it is.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; So now every seed has to bring forth
[1:21:47] after his kind. So Adam also all the
[1:21:50] potentials that lay in the seed that was
[1:21:51] in him had to bring himself to
[1:21:53] manifestation. So that God only had to
[1:21:55] give him a vessel or Eve so that he
[1:21:59] could be all that he is. Now in doing
[1:22:01] so, God introduced in Eden a weaker
[1:22:06] vessel.
[1:22:08] Think about this. Everything that God
[1:22:10] created was strong and fortified. And
[1:22:12] Eve is the only one that brethren calls
[1:22:15] the weaker vessel. Yeah,
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; it says it's an old battle that started
[1:22:20] way back beyond time and Satan and his
[1:22:22] angels were kicked out and they come to
[1:22:25] the earth and the battle set in again
[1:22:27] because Eve broke down the barrier from
[1:22:30] where she was isolated behind the word
[1:22:32] of God and from that very hour Satan won
[1:22:35] the battle over God's word because one
[1:22:37] of his subjects the weaker one let down
[1:22:39] the bars.
[1:22:41] So now because of weakness, Eve,
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; because of weakness introduced in Eden,
[1:22:48] humanity is now in chaos.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; And now Adam is going to portray
[1:22:53] something that Adam himself did not know
[1:22:56] was in him.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Eve is going to sin as we read. And now
[1:23:02] Adam, who is God on the earth, who is
[1:23:05] supposed to be the legislator, the
[1:23:07] lawkeeper, the righteous judge, he looks
[1:23:09] at the situation and he's supposed to
[1:23:11] pronounce the judgment. What will happen
[1:23:13] here?
[1:23:14] But instead, we see Adam take his wife
[1:23:16] unto himself and he expresses mercy and
[1:23:21] grace.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; And now mercy and grace are two
[1:23:24] different things. Mercy is if the is
[1:23:27] when the one who is in the position of
[1:23:29] power withholds the penalty,
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; right? If I have power over you and your
[1:23:34] faith is in my hands and I withhold the
[1:23:36] penalty, that's mercy. I showed you
[1:23:39] mercy. Grace is unmmerited favor. It's
[1:23:42] when I express to you something that you
[1:23:43] did not deserve. And then we see Adam
[1:23:46] portraying those two things, right?
[1:23:47] Because he does not pronounce judgment
[1:23:49] on Eve, mercy. And then he gives himself
[1:23:53] for Eve grace.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; And now these attributes were in Adam
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; and Adam did not know they were in him.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; It took weakness introduced in Eden
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; so that Adam could now express those
[1:24:10] attributes. And I love that Adam
[1:24:13] expressed them before God ever expressed
[1:24:15] them
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; because Adam was a reflector of God.
[1:24:18] HE'S ONLY DOING WHAT GOD WILL DO.
[1:24:21] HALLELUJAH.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; So then Adam parttook of Eve sin because
[1:24:26] he was going to have his wife no matter
[1:24:28] what.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Adam looked Eden and perfection.
[1:24:34] Sin and sickness.
[1:24:37] Eden and perfection without Eve. Sin
[1:24:41] with Eve.
[1:24:44] What do I do?
[1:24:45] And Adam, remember this decision was
[1:24:49] made when Adam was in theophony form,
[1:24:50] right? When he was in glorified form, he
[1:24:53] did not make this decision as he seen.
[1:24:54] He had not sinned yet. He saw what
[1:24:56] happened.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; He made the decision when he was in his
[1:25:00] right form. So that decision was only a
[1:25:03] reflection of what God would do in
[1:25:05] hisstead.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; It says perfection without Eve is not
[1:25:11] worth having. Think about that. Now, God
[1:25:14] had a chance to have the world with no
[1:25:17] sin, but without you. And then God had
[1:25:20] to choose. Do I keep perfection or do I
[1:25:23] step in time
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; to go get my bride back?
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; AND TO GOD, YOU were worth everything.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Now because of this
[1:25:37] chaos introduced by Eve,
[1:25:40] God comes down and says, "Adam,
[1:25:43] where are you?" And the way I think
[1:25:46] about this is now for the first time
[1:25:48] since God has made man, there was now an
[1:25:52] opportunity for other attributes of God
[1:25:56] to be quickened.
[1:25:58] So now God comes down and then he sees
[1:26:01] that his family has fallen into sin. And
[1:26:04] as a father, that broke his heart. OH
[1:26:07] NO, MY FAMILY. But wait a minute, as a
[1:26:10] savior, he got quickened.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Where the heart of the father was
[1:26:15] broken, the heart of the savior WAS
[1:26:17] QUICKENED. BECAUSE NOW THERE ARE SINNERS
[1:26:20] ON EARTH THAT A SAVIOR can now save.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Now because of what happened in Eden,
[1:26:26] THERE WILL BE SICKNESS INTRODUCED. AND
[1:26:29] NOW A HEALER CANNOT BE EXPRESSED.
[1:26:33] Not because OF SIN THERE'S NOT FEAR BUT
[1:26:36] now the one who speaks cannot be
[1:26:38] expressed. And now this father in Eden
[1:26:42] was the catalyst for Elohim to not
[1:26:45] display all that he is. Amen.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; So it was okay for God to allow sin
[1:26:53] temporarily
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; to step out of eternity and step into
[1:26:58] time and allow sin in time so that he
[1:27:01] can come and get you
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; and express himself to you and make
[1:27:05] himself known unto you.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; And now I want you to think about this.
[1:27:10] Because of what happened in Eden,
[1:27:12] there's going to be a first time
[1:27:15] where God would hear a man call him my
[1:27:18] provider.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; I want you to think about this.
[1:27:23] God had never heard those words before.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Nobody had ever called God provider
[1:27:31] before.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; And now for the first time, a son of God
[1:27:35] will pray and say, "Lord, you are my
[1:27:38] provider.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; FOR THE FIRST TIME, SOMEBODY WILL CALL
[1:27:43] HIM my savior,
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; MY HEALER.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; AND ALL THOSE ATTRIBUTES WERE ALWAYS IN
[1:27:51] HIM. AND FOR THOUSAND AND MILLIONS OF
[1:27:54] YEARS, NOBODY KNEW GOD AS THAT. BUT NOW,
[1:27:57] BECAUSE OF SIN IN EDEN, THERE'S GOING TO
[1:27:59] BE A PEOPLE NOW. AND I CAN CALL HIM WHAT
[1:28:02] HE IS.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; SEE, the one who knows him as God can
[1:28:12] only worship him because they know him
[1:28:14] as God.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; The one who knows him as a savior
[1:28:18] worships him because he's a savior.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; That's why the worship of angels is so
[1:28:23] limited.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; They only know him as God. And God
[1:28:27] enjoyed it. It was like, it's not quite
[1:28:30] what I want because you ONLY SEE ONE
[1:28:32] SIDE OF ME.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; I'M MORE THAN JUST AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP.
[1:28:36] I need to have people that are going TO
[1:28:38] WORSHIP ME FOR EVERYTHING THAT I AM.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; DON'T WITHHOLD YOUR WORSHIP FROM GOD
[1:28:46] BECAUSE THE ANGELS WORSHIP WERE NOT GOOD
[1:28:48] ENOUGH FOR HIM THAT HE ALLOWED THE FALSE
[1:28:50] THAT WHEN YOU WORSHIP HIM,
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; HE'S VERY SATISFIED BECAUSE ONLY YOU
[1:28:56] KNOW HIM THE WAY YOU know him.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; And when I mean when I say you, I don't
[1:29:01] mean the church. I mean you
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; as an individual
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; only you can worship God that way
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; because what GOD HAS BEEN TO YOU I DON'T
[1:29:11] KNOW
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; BUT I CAN TELL YOU WHAT HE HAS BEEN TO
[1:29:14] ME.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; So when I GO TO HIM AND PRAY AND WORSHIP
[1:29:18] IT SAYS OH GOD YOU'RE MY FATHER
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; CUZ I HAVE A FATHER SON RELATIONSHIP. I
[1:29:23] KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE HIM AS A
[1:29:25] FATHER. I CAN SAY YOU'RE MY HEALER
[1:29:27] BECAUSE I'VE SEEN HIM HEAL ME TIMES AND
[1:29:29] TIMES AGAIN. I CAN GO TO HIM AND SAY,
[1:29:31] "YOU'RE MY PROVIDER, LORD." BECAUSE I
[1:29:33] KNOW WHEN HE STEPPED IN MY LIFE AND
[1:29:35] PROVIDED. AND I CAN SAY, "YOU'RE A WAY
[1:29:37] MAKER, OH GOD, BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN I WAS
[1:29:39] LOST AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, HE
[1:29:41] CAME AND MADE A WAY FOR ME.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; I CAN SAY YOU'RE MY RESCUER BECAUSE HE
[1:29:45] CAME TO ME WHEN I COULDN'T GO TO HIM AND
[1:29:48] HE RESCUED ME."
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; THAT'S HOW I WORSHIP HIM.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; HOW DO [screaming] YOU WORSHIP HIM?
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; You know him the way YOU KNOW HIM.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY KNOW HIM AS A SAVIOR?
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY know him as a healer? How many
[1:29:59] know him as a deliverer? YOU KNOW WHAT
[1:30:01] IT'S LIKE TO BE BEING CHAINED. AND GOD
[1:30:04] COMES BY THE POWER OF HIS WORD AND SETS
[1:30:06] YOU FREE. AND WHEN YOU WORSHIP HIM,
[1:30:08] [screaming] YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING
[1:30:10] ABOUT.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGE HE BROUGHT IN YOUR
[1:30:13] LIFE.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHERE YOU WERE. I DON'T KNOW.
[1:30:16] YOU KNOW HOW FAR YOU WERE AND HOW FAR
[1:30:19] HIS LOVE WENT TO PULL YOU OUT. WHEN YOU
[1:30:22] WORSHIP HIM, ANGELS CAN WORSHIP THE WAY
[1:30:24] YOU DO.
[1:30:27] TAKE THE SHACKLES OF MY FEET SO I CAN
[1:30:29] DANCE. BREAK THE CHAIN SO I CAN LIFT MY
[1:30:32] HEAD.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO REJOICE BEFORE GOD BECAUSE I
[1:30:35] KNOW [screaming]
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; I KNOW HIM.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; NO WONDER WHEN THE ARK CAME BACK, DAVID
[1:30:42] STARTED REJOICING CUZ DAVID KNOW WHAT
[1:30:45] THE ARK REPRESENTED TO HIM.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; HE WAS A SHEPHERD BOY SOMEWHERE. NOBODY
[1:30:50] KNEW DAVID. WHEN GOD CAME AND TOOK HIM
[1:30:52] OUT OF BETHLEHEM AND JESSE'S HOUSE AND
[1:30:55] MADE HIM KING
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE SAW THE WORD RETURN, HE DID
[1:30:59] SOMETHING FOR DAVID.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; CUZ ONLY DAVID KNEW WHAT GOD DID FOR
[1:31:02] HIM.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; What does it mean to you?
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Don't come to church and say, "Okay, I
[1:31:08] got to compare my worship to that
[1:31:10] brother's worship."
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's quiet, so I had to be quiet,
[1:31:13] too.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. He doesn't know what
[1:31:15] you've been through.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T KNOW. YOU HAD TO WORSHIP GOD
[1:31:20] to reflect WHAT YOU KNOW HIM TO BE.
[1:31:24] [cheering]
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Not just because OF WHO HE IS, BUT WHO
[1:31:27] HE HAS been to you.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; WHAT ATTRIBUTE YOU'VE EXPERIENCE IN YOUR
[1:31:31] LIFE?
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW HIM AS A SAVIOR?
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW HIM AS A KEEPER? DO YOU KNOW
[1:31:36] HIM AS [screaming] A FATHER?
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW HIM AS A HUSBAND? [laughter]
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Do you KNOW HIM AS A PROMISEKEEPER? HAVE
[1:31:44] YOU EVER HELD ON TO A PROMISE IN SPITE
[1:31:47] OF CIRCUMSTANCES YEAR AFTER YEAR AND SEE
[1:31:51] IT COME TO PASS
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; AND YOU CAN SAY I KNOW [screaming] HIM
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; THAT HE KEEPS HIS PROMISE.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; HE KEEPS HIS WORD.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; I KNOW HIM.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; NOT THEORY. I KNOW [screaming]
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; IN WHOM I BELIEVE AND I'M PERSUADED.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO KNOW AND THEN YOU HAVE TO BE
[1:32:10] PERSUADED.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO KNOW HE'S GOD. YOU
[1:32:13] MUST BE PERSUADED THAT HE IS GOD.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT enough to be convinced. You
[1:32:19] must be concerned
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; to know and to be persuaded
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; that he is God.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; AND IT TOOK SIN FOR GOD TO make himself
[1:32:29] known unto you
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; in a way that you can have a
[1:32:32] relationship with him that only you can.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; And now God gets you in joy. I will
[1:32:38] worship. And each one of you has a
[1:32:41] different smelling flavor to God. It's
[1:32:44] different for all of us.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; The one who's experienced healing, when
[1:32:47] it comes to God, he knows he's a healer.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; The one who has never experienced
[1:32:51] healing cannot relate.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; We can sing the same songs.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; The song leader can come and say, "Let's
[1:32:57] stand and we all raise our hands.
[1:32:59] Jehovah."
[1:33:01] We all sing my proider.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; To some, it's words. to somebody else's
[1:33:09] is experience.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Two different things. And then you
[1:33:13] wonder why somebody can get so ENTHUSED
[1:33:15] AND SAYS JEHOVAH GYRA MY PROVIDER.
[1:33:18] [screaming]
[1:33:19] YOU'RE LIKE, "OH, THIS BROTHER IS A
[1:33:20] FANATIC." NO, YOU DON'T KNOW. HE'S BEEN
[1:33:22] IN CONTACT WITH A PROVIDER.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; AN ATTRIBUTE THAT WAS DORMANT. THIS
[1:33:28] BROTHER OR SISTER HAS BEEN IN CONTACT
[1:33:30] WITH THAT ATTRIBUTE. THAT'S WHY THEY
[1:33:32] SING THE WAY THEY SING.
[1:33:36] Like this brother is a little bit too
[1:33:37] LOUD IN CHURCH. YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE HE
[1:33:38] WAS. YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THE LOVE OF
[1:33:41] GOD FOUND HIM.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; I WAS THERE WHEN IT HAPPENED TO ME. SO I
[1:33:46] OUGHT TO [screaming] KNOW.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; I was THERE WHEN JESUS FOUND ME.
[1:33:50] [laughter]
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Don't come and tell me WHAT TO DO. YOU
[1:33:53] DON'T KNOW WHAT I KNOW.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Let's just leave it at that. I KNOW
[1:33:57] WHERE I WAS.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; I KNOW WHAT I USED TO BE. I KNOW WHAT I
[1:34:01] USED TO DO. I KNOW WHAT I WHERE I USED
[1:34:03] TO GO. AND THAT [screaming] MAN IS DEAD.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; AND I'M A DIFFERENT MAN TODAY. AND THE
[1:34:08] ONE WHO DID IT IS ELOHIM. AND HE CAME IN
[1:34:11] THE FLESH AS A SAVIOR. AND HE CAME IN MY
[1:34:13] LIFE AS A DELIVERER. I KNOW [screaming]
[1:34:15] HIM BETTER.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; And now angels are watching God do this.
[1:34:26] God comes and kicks them out. But he
[1:34:28] devised a plan to redeem them. And
[1:34:31] angels say, "Oh my, he is a redeemer."
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; News flash, ANGELS ARE MORE THAN JUST AN
[1:34:38] OBJECT OF WORSHIP.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; NOW, angels begin to see a side of God
[1:34:42] they've never quite seen before.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; And now, thanks to the fall. You heard
[1:34:47] me right.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; I didn't say because of the fall. I say
[1:34:50] thanks to the fall.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Thanks to the fall, these attributes of
[1:34:54] God are what we get to experience.
[1:34:57] You know, God could have created us all
[1:34:58] perfect without sin. We will be no
[1:35:01] different than angels.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; He will have a good family on earth like
[1:35:06] he did Adam and Eve, but we only know
[1:35:08] him as a father and as a God. We will
[1:35:11] not know what it's like to be so alone,
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; so abandoned by everyone
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; and you cannot even express to anybody
[1:35:20] how you feel. But he comes to you in the
[1:35:23] privacy of your prayer room and then he
[1:35:26] ministers to you.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; You will never know what that's like.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; You will never know what it's like to
[1:35:31] have peace that surpasses all
[1:35:34] understanding. When nothing makes sense
[1:35:37] in your life, but still there is peace.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Some of you when YOU BELIEVE THE
[1:35:42] MESSAGE, EVERYBODY FORSOOK YOU. YOUR
[1:35:44] FRIENDS, YOUR PARENTS, YOUR FAMILY,
[1:35:45] EVERYBODY, AND YOU ARE ALL ALONE. AND
[1:35:47] GOD COME AND SAY, "WALK WITH ME.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; It's just it's just you and me." YOU
[1:35:51] WILL NEVER KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; So now
[1:36:02] we know that a tree is recognized by its
[1:36:04] fruits.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; A tree doesn't need to tell us what it
[1:36:09] is.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; What it is.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; You're walking by a tree, you see some
[1:36:17] apples. Oh, that's an apple tree. Right?
[1:36:20] You tell the tree what it is by the
[1:36:24] fruits it bears. A tree doesn't say,
[1:36:26] "Hey, by pastor, I am an apple tree."
[1:36:28] No, the fruits it bears tells you what
[1:36:31] it is. And God is identified by his
[1:36:35] characteristics.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; In other words, many began to tell God
[1:36:40] what he is. Why? By the fruits he was
[1:36:44] bearing.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; God didn't have to come AND TELL US,
[1:36:47] "I'M A SAVIOR." NO, HE saved and then
[1:36:50] the fruits OF SALVATION AND I TOLD HIM
[1:36:53] [screaming]
[1:36:54] YOU ARE MY SAVIOR.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; GOD DIDN'T COME AND SAY I'M A HEALER.
[1:36:59] NO, HE SAYS MOSES RAISED THE BRASS
[1:37:02] SERPENT AND LET THE PEOPLE LOOKED AND
[1:37:04] LIVE. And when the people looked and
[1:37:06] THEY WERE HEALED, THEY SAY HE
[1:37:08] [screaming] IS A HEALER.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; THEY BEGAN TO TELL HIM WHAT FRUITS HE
[1:37:13] WAS BEARING. THEY BEGIN TO RECOGNIZE
[1:37:16] WHAT ATTRIBUTES HE WAS MANIFESTING.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; We begin to tell him what he is.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; And that's why we can pray. He says,
[1:37:24] "You are so lovely.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; You are all lovely." Why? Because of the
[1:37:28] fruits he bears in my life. I tell him,
[1:37:30] "You are lovely."
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; You know, brother Moses says, "Brother
[1:37:34] Ray is a song leader." Brother Ray
[1:37:36] didn't come and say, "I'm a song
[1:37:37] leader."
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; He just bore fruits
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; by the fruits he bears. We tell him what
[1:37:43] it is. Amen.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; I was told that I was a preacher long
[1:37:46] before I started preaching.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; I never said, "Oh, I want to be a
[1:37:49] preacher. I'm a preacher." No, I just
[1:37:51] bore fruits.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; And then people looked at me and I
[1:37:54] looked at the fruit and says, "You're a
[1:37:55] preacher. You're going to be a preacher.
[1:37:57] You're going to preacher." THAT'S THE
[1:37:58] SAME THING. GOD JUST DISPLAYED his
[1:38:00] attributes.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; And then WE BEGAN TO TELL HIM, "YOU'RE
[1:38:03] MY SAVIOR. YOU'RE MY HEALER. YOU'RE MY
[1:38:06] DELIVERER. YOU'RE MY PROVIDER."
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; WORDS FAIL. THERE'S TOO MANY WORDS.
[1:38:11] YOU'RE MY WAY MAKER. WHO CAME UP WITH
[1:38:13] THAT? WAY MAKER. SOMEBODY WHO SAW GOD ME
[1:38:16] A WAY CALLED HIM WAY MAKER.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU CALL HIM AS?
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE SEEN HIM DO WHAT HE DOES.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; TELL HIM WHAT HE has been to you.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; That's what true worship is. When he
[1:38:28] reflects back to God, this is what you
[1:38:30] have been to me. Good.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; And I can prove this to you by the
[1:38:35] scripture because in Genesis 22:14,
[1:38:38] it tells us, "And the angel of the Lord
[1:38:40] called unto him out of heaven and
[1:38:41] said,"Abraham, Abraham." And he said,
[1:38:43] "Here I am." And he said, "Lay not thy
[1:38:46] hand upon the lad, neither do thou
[1:38:49] anything unto him, for now I know, did
[1:38:52] thou fearest God, seeing that thou has
[1:38:54] not withheld thy son, thy only son, from
[1:38:57] me." And Abraham lifted up his eyes and
[1:39:00] looked, and behold, behind him a ram was
[1:39:04] caught in the thicket by his horns. And
[1:39:06] Abraham went and took the ram and
[1:39:08] offered him up for a burnt offering
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; in thestead of his son. And Abraham
[1:39:13] called the name of the place Jehovah
[1:39:17] Gyra.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; And it said to this day, in the month of
[1:39:21] the Lord, it shall BE SEEN. NOW GOD
[1:39:23] DIDN'T COME TO ABRAHAM SAYS ABRAHAM
[1:39:25] withhold your hand from YOUR SON BECAUSE
[1:39:27] I AM JEHOVAH GYRA. No
[1:39:31] he only provided a ram. And when Abraham
[1:39:34] SAW THAT HE SAYS I WILL CALL YOU JEHOVAH
[1:39:37] GYRA BECAUSE YOU HAVE SEEN ME AND YOU
[1:39:40] HAVE PROVIDED FOR ME. And now we can all
[1:39:43] sing Jehovah Gyra. You know who called
[1:39:46] that revelation first? Abraham.
[1:39:48] We sing songs today because a man called
[1:39:52] God Jehovah Gyra. A MAN CALLED GOD who
[1:39:57] he is.
[1:40:00] We can see it again in Exodus 17:15.
[1:40:04] He says, "And the Lord said unto Moses,
[1:40:07] write this for a memorial in the book
[1:40:08] and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua,
[1:40:10] for I will utterly put out the
[1:40:12] remembrance of Amalecch from under the
[1:40:14] heaven." And Moses built an altar and
[1:40:17] called the name of it Jehovah Nissi.
[1:40:21] For he said, because the Lord had sworn
[1:40:23] that the Lord will have war with
[1:40:25] Amalecch, Nissi is our banner. AND THEY
[1:40:27] SAW GOD STAND BEFORE THEM AND DEFEAT THE
[1:40:30] AMALACHITES. And they called him
[1:40:33] Jehovahi.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; And the Lord said unto Gideon, "Peace be
[1:40:38] unto thee. Fear not, thou shalt not
[1:40:41] die." Then Gideon built an altar there
[1:40:43] unto the Lord and called it Jehovah
[1:40:46] Shalom.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Who told God it was Jehovah Shalom?
[1:40:50] Gideon. God just express his attributes
[1:40:53] and then we saw it for what it is and we
[1:40:55] say that's what you are.
[1:41:02] Matthew chapter 16. When Jesus came into
[1:41:04] the course of Philippi, Cesaria
[1:41:06] Philippi, he asked his disciples,
[1:41:07] saying, "Whom do men say that I, the son
[1:41:10] of God, I, the son of man, am?" And they
[1:41:12] said, "Some say that you are John the
[1:41:15] Baptist. Some say you're Elias, others
[1:41:17] Jeremiah or one of the prophets." But he
[1:41:19] said unto them, "Who do you say
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; I am?"
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; That's the question he's asking you this
[1:41:26] morning. WHO DO YOU SAY I AM? OR SOME
[1:41:27] SAY YOU'RE A PROVIDER. SOME SAY YOU'RE A
[1:41:29] KEEPER. SOME SAY YOU'RE A HEALER. OKAY.
[1:41:31] BUT what do YOU SAY ABOUT ME? WHAT HAVE
[1:41:35] YOU SEEN IN YOUR LIFE? WHAT HAVE I DONE
[1:41:37] FOR YOU? WHO DO YOU SAY I AM? WHAT
[1:41:39] ATTRIBUTES HAVE YOU SEEN IN YOUR LIFE?
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; And then Peter answers, "Thou art the
[1:41:45] Christ."
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; PETER SAW SOMETHING. HE SAW THAT THIS
[1:41:48] MAN Jesus was AN ATTRIBUTE OF GOD THAT
[1:41:51] WAS IN ELOHIM. And that attribute came
[1:41:54] down in time and was made manifest in
[1:41:56] the flesh. And that was the Christ OF
[1:41:59] GOD. THAT'S WHAT PETER SAW. That's
[1:42:01] powerful.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Peter didn't see just a prophet. He's
[1:42:05] like, "No, no, no. This is more than a
[1:42:06] prophet. What I'm seeing here is an
[1:42:08] attribute that was in Elohim.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; The son of God has come down into time
[1:42:12] and is made manifest in THE FLESH. YOU
[1:42:15] ARE THE CHRIST."
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:20] the the dying thief of the cross say
[1:42:22] remember me when you will come in your
[1:42:26] kingdom.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; So this man in the dying minutes of his
[1:42:30] life
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; recognizes this man is a king.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; HE SAW AN ATTRIBUTE IN HIM WAS THE
[1:42:38] ABILITY TO BE KING AND HERE AT THE CROSS
[1:42:40] IS A KING.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; What have you seen?
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; What seeest thou? What do you see in
[1:42:48] THESE LAST DAYS?
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU IN THESE LAST
[1:42:51] DAYS? WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THIS
[1:42:53] MINISTRY? Could this be Malachi 4? Could
[1:42:56] this be Revelation 10? WHAT HAVE YOU
[1:42:58] SEEN? Elijah the prophet.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; You know what Elijah the prophet is?
[1:43:04] Program says that Elijah is Christ
[1:43:08] himself.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; I can read the quote if you want. Elijah
[1:43:12] is Jesus Christ himself.
[1:43:15] We used to think that Elijah was brother
[1:43:17] Brandham.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Elijah is Jesus Christ himself that
[1:43:22] comes in the form of a prophet. He uses
[1:43:27] A PROPHET. THAT'S WHAT FULFILLS MALACHI
[1:43:29] 4 IS WHEN CHRIST HIMSELF COMES TO YOU BY
[1:43:32] THE WAY OF A PROPHET. THAT'S WHAT YOU
[1:43:35] SEE IN THIS LAST DAYS.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; Some saw a healing gift.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; You saw the word open up.
[1:43:44] Now we read
[1:43:46] that out of a curse will come the
[1:43:48] blessing of Abraham.
[1:43:51] Brother says God's holiness, God being
[1:43:53] God, he projects that himself
[1:43:56] wasn't a sinner.
[1:43:58] He would have never been a savior.
[1:44:02] And but he was a savior at the
[1:44:04] beginning, but there was nothing lost.
[1:44:07] And his own attributes
[1:44:11] as being a savior, now listen to this,
[1:44:14] projected a sinner.
[1:44:19] There had to be something to be saved.
[1:44:21] Before there could be anything saved,
[1:44:23] there had to be something lost. And in
[1:44:25] his righteousness and in his holiness,
[1:44:28] there would have never been a sick
[1:44:29] person. He would never been a healer.
[1:44:30] But from the beginning of the
[1:44:32] beginnings, he was even before the
[1:44:33] beginning, he was a healer. So there was
[1:44:35] nothing sick. So he projected a sick
[1:44:38] person that he might heal them to make
[1:44:42] him [snorts]
[1:44:42] a healer.
[1:44:45] It's powerful to me because I used to
[1:44:47] think that sin projected a sinner,
[1:44:51] projected sickness. But a prophet
[1:44:54] corrects me here. He says God, his
[1:44:57] attributes projected a sinner. Think
[1:45:01] about it.
[1:45:02] God was a healer. And to be a healer,
[1:45:07] somebody had to be sick. So he is the
[1:45:11] one who's actually at the origin
[1:45:15] of the plan of redemption by allowing
[1:45:17] Satan to come and deceive Eve. God is
[1:45:19] the one who orchestrates this. See the
[1:45:21] devil thinks that when he won in Eden
[1:45:23] that that was his doing. He's like I
[1:45:26] came and I destroy the plan of God. I
[1:45:28] come and I destroy his family and he
[1:45:29] went his way rejoicing. God is like
[1:45:31] thanks Satan. That was part of my plan.
[1:45:34] Thanks. Thanks for doing that.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; And then the devil rejoices AND HE IS
[1:45:38] HAPPY. HE THINKS THAT HE WON. GOD IS
[1:45:40] LIKE, "YEP, that's exactly what I had
[1:45:42] planned because now that attribute
[1:45:44] projected the sinner. Now I can go
[1:45:45] save." And then you think that the devil
[1:45:47] gets any credit. He doesn't get any
[1:45:50] credit
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; for anything that happens in your life.
[1:45:54] He does not get any credit. Believers
[1:45:56] are too QUICK TO SAY THE DEVIL DID THIS,
[1:45:58] THE DEVIL DID THAT, HE DID NOTHING.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; God is at the origin of everything.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; How do I know this? The Bible tells us
[1:46:06] that before Satan came to Job, he went
[1:46:08] to God.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; The the devil DID NOT COME BY PER
[1:46:12] adventure and I'm just going to go ahead
[1:46:14] in Job's life and start destroying his
[1:46:16] life. No, no, no. HE WENT TO GOD
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; AND GOD SAID, "HAVE you considered
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Job?"
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; He's like, "Yeah, yeah, well, you know,
[1:46:25] you've blessed him and you've protected
[1:46:26] him. What do you expect?" He's like,
[1:46:28] "Well, go ahead. Do whatever you want,
[1:46:30] but here are the parameters. You can do
[1:46:33] this. You can do that, you can do this,
[1:46:35] but you can't do that.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; He's like, "Okay." And then the devil
[1:46:38] comes and ABRA IS LIKE, "THE DEVIL DID
[1:46:40] THIS TO ME. HE DID THIS TO ME." JOB IS
[1:46:42] LIKE, "THE DEVIL DID THIS." IT'S LIKE,
[1:46:43] "NO, it's not the devil." God is like,
[1:46:46] "I did this. I did this." So the devil
[1:46:48] gets zero credit. I don't want to give
[1:46:51] him credit for the bad things that
[1:46:52] happened in my life because it's going
[1:46:54] to make him feel like he does things.
[1:46:56] He's going to make you feel like he has
[1:46:57] some power over me. LIKE YOU HAVE NO
[1:46:59] POWER OVER ME. If I'm sick, GOD ALLOW ME
[1:47:03] TO BE SICK
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; FOR A PURPOSE.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; EITHER TO HEAL ME OR FOR ANOTHER
[1:47:08] PURPOSE. BUT THE DEVIL GETS ZERO CREDIT.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; ZERO. HE THINKS HE'S SO USEFUL. HE IS
[1:47:16] USEFUL TO GOD. BUT IN HIMSELF, HE IS
[1:47:19] NOTHING.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; ZERO POWER. HE COULD NOT EVEN COME TO
[1:47:22] JOB, A MAN UNDER THE BLOOD OF BULLS AND
[1:47:25] GOATS WITHOUT PERMISSION. HOW ABOUT YOU?
[1:47:28] AMEN.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; YOU THINK HE CAN LAY HIS HANDS ON YOU
[1:47:34] WITHOUT PERMISSION?
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; THINK TWICE.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL DOESN'T have the license to
[1:47:39] just walk in your life AND START DOING
[1:47:41] WHATEVER HE WANTS. THOSE THINGS DO NOT
[1:47:43] HAPPEN.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; HE wants you to believe HE HAS THE POWER
[1:47:46] to do that. HE DOES NOT HAVE.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; BEFORE anything happens to your life,
[1:47:52] the devil has to go to God
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; and then negotiate with God.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Right? Right? Cuz he negotiated. The
[1:47:57] first time God said, "Go ahead,
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; take all that he has." He did
[1:48:01] everything. And he came back. God says,
[1:48:02] "See," he's like, "Well, you didn't let
[1:48:04] me touch him." And he's negotiating.
[1:48:05] He's like, "Can can I can I touch his
[1:48:07] life, too?" Okay, fine. But don't take
[1:48:09] his life. So any power that the devil is
[1:48:12] given over us,
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; is given by God
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; with parameters.
[1:48:17] So the devil can only go as far as God
[1:48:20] would allow him to go.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; That's all. REST IN PEACE. THE DEVIL CAN
[1:48:25] ONLY GO AS FAR. THERE'S A CHAIN ON HIM
[1:48:28] LIKE A DOG HAS CHAIN.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN BARK AND CAN'T BARK BUT AND THEN
[1:48:31] YOU STOP AND THE CHAIN PULLS you back
[1:48:33] and you try and the chain pulls you
[1:48:35] back. When the devil COMES IN YOUR LIFE
[1:48:36] SAYS GO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT AND THEN HE
[1:48:38] TRIES TO GO FURTHER. COME BACK HERE.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; That's it. THOSE ARE THE PARAMETERS. GOD
[1:48:44] IS IN CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE. HE GETS ALL
[1:48:47] THE CREDIT, ALL THE PRAISE, [screaming]
[1:48:49] ALL THE GLORY IN THE GOOD TIMES, IN THE
[1:48:51] BAD TIMES, IN THE WORST TIMES. YOU MIGHT
[1:48:54] GO THROUGH THE WORST TIME AS A FAMILY,
[1:48:56] AS A CHURCH. GOD [screaming] GETS THE
[1:48:58] credit
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; because he only allows weakness so that
[1:49:03] he can show his strength.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we wonder, Lord, why did you
[1:49:06] let these things happen to me?
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Why did you let me go through these
[1:49:09] things or why did you let these things
[1:49:10] happen to the church? For a reason.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; And the reason is that God wants to
[1:49:15] express himself to you more than what
[1:49:17] you know. Amen.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Out of that same holy realm yonder that
[1:49:24] comes salvation comes a curse. Out of
[1:49:27] the same mother and father that
[1:49:28] projected Jacob, he projected Esau.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Says there has to be something lost to
[1:49:33] be saved. Him being a savior, he made
[1:49:36] that the deep calls to the deep.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; So he could not even be a savior unless
[1:49:44] I was lost.
[1:49:47] The only reason why I was lost is
[1:49:50] because he was a savior in the first
[1:49:52] place.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; The only reason God let you get sick is
[1:49:56] because he's a healer.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; In other words, you can never find
[1:50:00] yourself in a situation or circumstance
[1:50:02] that God is not the answer to.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Or else he will not allow it.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; The things he allows, he's the answer
[1:50:10] to. He allows sin because he's a savior.
[1:50:12] He allows sickness because he's a
[1:50:14] healer. HE ALLOWS US BECAUSE HE HAS THE
[1:50:16] ANSWER TO IT. SO YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO
[1:50:18] BE IN A SITUATION WHERE GOD IS NOT THE
[1:50:20] ANSWER. IF HE ALLOWS IT, HE IS THE
[1:50:23] ANSWER.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we get sick and then we get
[1:50:33] the wrong attitude because we think that
[1:50:34] maybe we did something wrong. Maybe God
[1:50:37] is mad at us. Maybe he's punishing us.
[1:50:39] But the way God looks at it, he says, "I
[1:50:42] just want to find my fulfillment in
[1:50:45] you." Because he is made perfect in our
[1:50:48] weakness.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; He's fulfilled in our weakness.
[1:50:55] Now, I want to come to a close with this
[1:50:57] thought here. I'll build up to this. We
[1:51:01] talked about God having all these
[1:51:03] attributes of healer, savior, deliverer.
[1:51:06] All those are attributes.
[1:51:08] But so were you. I want you to think
[1:51:12] about this. In God was an attribute to
[1:51:15] be a savior. But you were also an
[1:51:19] attribute in God. How many know that's
[1:51:21] true? You know that that's what the
[1:51:22] prophet say that you are attributes in
[1:51:24] him. Okay. Let me just read this for
[1:51:26] you. Now here we are coming to a
[1:51:29] conclusion. as the eternal logos was
[1:51:33] manifest in the son and Jesus dwelt all
[1:51:36] the fullness of the godhead bodily and
[1:51:38] that eternal one was the father manifest
[1:51:40] in the flesh and thereby gain the title
[1:51:43] of son I love how the the prophet says
[1:51:46] this because the title of son is given
[1:51:49] to the eternal father made manifest in
[1:51:51] the flesh that's what the son of god is
[1:51:54] is the father made manifest in the flesh
[1:51:58] but then he goes on to say even so We
[1:52:01] eternal in his thoughts in our turn just
[1:52:06] just like Jesus in our turn became the
[1:52:09] many membered spoken word seed manifest
[1:52:12] in the flesh and those eternal thoughts
[1:52:15] now manifest in the flesh of the sons of
[1:52:17] God even as we are so-called he's saying
[1:52:22] why are we called sons of God that title
[1:52:26] sons of God means that we were the
[1:52:29] eternal thoughts of God and now we're
[1:52:31] made manifest in the flesh. In other
[1:52:34] words, we were attributes that were in
[1:52:36] God and now we are expressed. Just like
[1:52:39] savior was an attribute that was
[1:52:41] expressed, you were an attribute that
[1:52:44] was expressed. Just like deliverer was
[1:52:47] dormant and then expressed, you were
[1:52:50] laying dormant in him and now you've
[1:52:52] been expressed. Therefore, you gain the
[1:52:54] title of sons of God.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; Okay? Now, I want you to think about it
[1:52:58] this way.
[1:53:01] God was potentially God.
[1:53:05] That attribute was dormant and then God
[1:53:08] did something
[1:53:10] so that that attribute can made can be
[1:53:12] made manifest and be quickened. Right?
[1:53:15] Now you were dormant in him
[1:53:19] and then God did something to allow you
[1:53:21] to be expressed so that you can be
[1:53:22] quickened and now he you can be
[1:53:24] expressed as a nature that was in him.
[1:53:26] So if in God an attribute means the
[1:53:29] ability to become right if God had the
[1:53:33] ability to be a savior or the potential
[1:53:35] to be a savior element's potential and
[1:53:38] then I was an attribute in him I'm also
[1:53:42] his potentials.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Now I want to say to you this way that
[1:53:47] means that God had the potential to
[1:53:50] become me.
[1:53:53] I think about that
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; he had the potential to be a savior,
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; to be a healer, but I am also an
[1:54:00] attribute which means he had the
[1:54:02] potential to become me.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; That's Elohim's potential that IN HIM
[1:54:08] WERE ATTRIBUTES AND GOD HAD THE
[1:54:10] POTENTIAL TO BECOME FLESH IN HIS
[1:54:13] ATTRIBUTES.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; WHAT AM I THE WHAT AM I TRYING TO SAY?
[1:54:17] THE DESIRE OF GOD WAS TO BECOME FLESH.
[1:54:22] The Bible says he became me, RIGHT? HE
[1:54:25] BECAME ME THAT I MAY BECOME THE
[1:54:27] RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD. GOD WANTED TO
[1:54:29] DWELL IN HUMAN FLESH.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; GO READ who is this miser. That's what
[1:54:33] he says. He says he started
[1:54:35] condescending and making himself into
[1:54:37] the flesh. He started as a as a logos.
[1:54:40] He came as a theophony. Then that
[1:54:42] theophony came in the flesh to visit
[1:54:43] Abraham. And then that theophony was
[1:54:45] made flesh
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ. That's what he says.
[1:54:48] Amen.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; And now HE SAYS, "NOW WE ARE the many
[1:54:50] membered spoken word." In other words,
[1:54:53] God Elohim, HE'S NOW REALIZING HIS
[1:54:56] potentials by dwelling in your flesh.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; To me, that's powerful. THAT A SON OF
[1:55:05] GOD IS GOD EXPRESSED IN THE FLESH.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE. YOU ARE AN
[1:55:11] ATTRIBUTE OF GOD. YOU COME FROM GOD. YOU
[1:55:13] GO BACK TO GOD. AND GOD HAS STEPPED INTO
[1:55:16] TIME
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; IN YOU.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; SO THAT HE can live HIS LIFE AND EXPRESS
[1:55:21] HIS LIFE THROUGH YOU.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; You want to see God, you look to your
[1:55:28] left and you look to your right.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Where do you think God is?
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; When God created,
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; he created angels. He created the sun,
[1:55:41] the stars, the moon, and everything.
[1:55:45] And then he created men and then he
[1:55:48] rested. He didn't make anything after
[1:55:51] man. Right? You know why? Because
[1:55:53] brothers and sisters, the creation was
[1:55:54] the expression of his attributes. He was
[1:55:56] showing all that he is.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; But when he created man, he stopped
[1:55:59] there. Because man is the final
[1:56:03] expression of God.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; There's nothing up to man. When God made
[1:56:07] man, that was to express him. THE WAY TO
[1:56:10] SEE GOD IS TO LOOK AT MAN. AMEN.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; WHITE MEN, SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; HE HAD THE POTENTIAL TO BE YOU. AND
[1:56:19] BECAUSE OF SIN, HE STEPPED INTO TIME AND
[1:56:22] THROUGH REDEMPTION, HE BECAME YOU.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; WHAT AM I LOOKING AT HERE? SONS OF GOD,
[1:56:28] ELOHIM'S ATTRIBUTES, HIS POTENTIALS THAT
[1:56:31] ARE NOW REALIZED. HE WAS POTENTIALLY ME.
[1:56:35] NOW HE ACTUALLY BECAME ME BECAUSE NOW HE
[1:56:37] CAME INTO MY SOUL. AND THE HOLY GHOST IS
[1:56:40] GOD IN HUMAN FLESH MADE MANIFEST.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS AN
[1:56:45] ATTRIBUTE THAT ONCE WAS IN GOD.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; I wasn't in this form. I WAS IN
[1:56:52] ATTRIBUTE FORM, BUT I WAS IN THE LOGOS.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; YOU WERE IN THE LOGOS. THAT'S WHY SONS
[1:56:57] OF GOD WERE CALLED THE STARS OF THE
[1:56:59] MORNING. THEY WERE SHOUTING [screaming]
[1:57:00] FOR JOY
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY WERE IN THE LOGOS. BUT NOW
[1:57:04] THEY'VE STEPPED INTO FLESH.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; WHAT AM I LOOKING AT? SONS OF GOD.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHAT ARE SONS OF GOD? The eternal
[1:57:10] father made manifest in the flesh.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; That's what we read. [clears throat]
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the son of God because HE WAS
[1:57:15] THE ETERNAL ONE MADE MANIFEST IN THE
[1:57:17] flesh and HE GAINED THE TITLE OF SON.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; IT SAYS EVEN SO WE ARE HIS ETERNAL
[1:57:22] THOUGHTS AND NOW WE'RE MADE MANIFEST AND
[1:57:25] WE ARE CALLED SONS OF GOD.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S THE SON of God? It's a thought.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; An eternal thought made manifest.
[1:57:35] Amen.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; Beloved,
[1:57:38] now are we
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; the sons OF GOD.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; NOW [screaming] ARE WE THE SONS OF GOD,
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; NOT TOMORROW. NOW ARE WE THE SONS OF
[1:57:47] GOD. YOU COME FROM GOD. YOU GO BACK TO
[1:57:50] GOD. AND IN THE EVENING TIME, YOU HAVE
[1:57:53] TO GO BACK TO WHERE YOU CAME FROM.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; That's why says we look at the shadows
[1:57:59] of the evening time, right? And what
[1:58:01] does the evening time tell us? It's
[1:58:02] homegoing time. Amen.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; We all get up in the morning. We all go
[1:58:06] to work. Some go to school. And when the
[1:58:09] day is over, where do you go?
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; Home.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; You don't you don't need to be told
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; go home.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; The evening time tells you it's time TO
[1:58:19] GO HOME.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; AND THEN YOU GO HOME. WHERE DO YOU GO?
[1:58:23] WHERE YOU LEFT IN THE MORNING?
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T LEAVE YOUR HOUSE AND THEN GO
[1:58:27] BACK TO SOMEBODY ELSE'S HOUSE. YOU GO
[1:58:29] BACK TO WHERE YOU CAME FROM BECAUSE YOUR
[1:58:31] ORIGIN IS YOUR DESTINATION.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; WHERE YOU CAME FROM IS WHERE YOU GO BACK
[1:58:37] TO.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; JESUS TOLD US, I COME FROM GOD. I GO
[1:58:41] BACK TO GOD.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, HE'S SAYING, I WAS
[1:58:45] [screaming] AN ATTRIBUTE IN THE LOGOS
[1:58:46] AND I'M RETURNING BACK IN LOGOS FORM.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE. YOU COME FROM GOD.
[1:58:52] YOU GO BACK TO GOD. NOW, YOU ARE THE
[1:58:53] SONS OF GOD.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; If the logos is your origin, The Lord
[1:58:59] Ghost is your destination.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; YOU CANNOT COME FROM GOD AND END UP
[1:59:02] SOMEWHERE [screaming] ELSE. IF YOU COME
[1:59:04] FROM GOD, AS SURE AS GOD IS GOD, THERE'S
[1:59:06] A RAPTURE FOR YOU CUZ YOU GOT TO GO BACK
[1:59:09] WHERE YOU COME FROM.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; And the devil thinks he can step in
[1:59:14] between
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; and then change your destination.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; The only way to change where you're
[1:59:19] going is to change where you come from.
[1:59:21] Amen.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; The DNA test,
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; the paternity test
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; is to find the genes in the father
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; that matches the gene in the son.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THERE'S A MATCH IN THOSE GENES,
[1:59:39] WE SAY WE'RE 99.9%.
[1:59:42] THIS MAN IS THE FATHER.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; AND JESUS SAID THE THE PHARISEES SAYS,
[1:59:47] "OUR FATHER ABRAHAM." AMEN.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
[1:59:51] Let me give you a DNA test. Let me take
[1:59:54] a sample here. I want to do a DNA test."
[1:59:56] And Jesus took their sample and did a
[1:59:58] DNA test. AND IT SAYS, "YOU OF YOUR
[2:00:01] FATHER, THE DEVIL."
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; Because if YOU KNEW ABRAHAM,
[2:00:05] YOU WOULD KNOW ME BECAUSE ABRAHAM SAW MY
[2:00:08] DAY. ABRAHAM WAS AN ATTRIBUTE in me and
[2:00:11] our jeans match. IF YOU ARE HIS GENE,
[2:00:14] YOU WILL MATCH WITH ME.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; BUT I see you come from the devil. He's
[2:00:18] your father and you're DOING HIS WORKS,
[2:00:20] BUT YOU DON'T COME FROM THE DEVIL
[2:00:22] BECAUSE YOUR DNA MATCHES GOD'S DNA.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S THE PATERNITY TEST?
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; HOW DO you know who's your father?
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Receiving the word for your day.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; WHY DID GOD SEND A PROPHET? HE WANTED TO
[2:00:39] GATHER A BRIDE. AND THE BRIDE IS MADE of
[2:00:43] sons of God attributes. So to gather a
[2:00:46] bride, you have to find sons and
[2:00:48] daughters, right? Because they formed
[2:00:50] THE BRIDE. SO GOD GAVE BROTHER A
[2:00:52] MESSAGE.
[2:00:54] The opening of the seals is God's DNA
[2:00:58] test.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; And the prophet BECAME TO PREACH THE
[2:01:02] OPENING OF the word to you and
[2:01:04] administer to you a DNA test. AND WHEN
[2:01:07] YOU HEARD THE WORD,
[2:01:10] WHEN YOU HEARD THE WORD, IT TOOK A
[2:01:12] SAMPLE OF YOUR GENE. AND THEN YOU FIND
[2:01:14] YOURSELF IN THE WORLD AND THEN YOU SAW
[2:01:17] YOUR NAME.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU SAW YOUR NAME, YOU RECOGNIZE
[2:01:23] GOD IS MY FATHER.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY OF YOU BELIEVE the message?
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; How many you believe the message? Not
[2:01:30] just say it. BELIEVE IT.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; IT'S BEEN REVEALED TO YOU TO BE THE
[2:01:33] TRUTH OF GOD THAT I CAN SAY ON THE
[2:01:35] AUTHORITY OF THE WORD, YOUR NAME IS IN
[2:01:37] THIS BOOK.
[2:01:40] THAT'S WHY YOU BELIEVE IT CUZ YOU HEARD
[2:01:43] [screaming] YOUR NAME.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; You know when you walk walked to the
[2:01:50] airport. This happened to me once.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; I was very late. I was flying somewhere
[2:01:54] and then I heard passenger Jean man. I
[2:01:56] say please report to the counter
[2:01:58] promptly for departure. Passenger.
[2:02:00] Passenger Jean. As soon as I heard my
[2:02:02] name, I started running.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Everybody else was walking. I was
[2:02:07] running because there was a destination
[2:02:10] I was being called to.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; Because I heard my name being called.
[2:02:15] Those who did not hear the name did not
[2:02:17] run with me.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; I was the ONLY ONE WHO RAN there and ask
[2:02:21] ME, "ARE YOU JOHN?" "YES. WHERE'S YOUR
[2:02:23] IDENTIFICATION? HERE'S MY ID." OKAY, YOU
[2:02:26] ARE WHAT YOU HEARD.
[2:02:31] [screaming]
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; I PROVE THAT I AM WHAT I HEARD. I AM THE
[2:02:36] NAME THAT WAS CALLED AND I HAD AN
[2:02:38] IDENTIFICATION TO PROVE IT. THAT'S THE
[2:02:41] REASON WHY YOU BELIEVE AND OTHERS DON'T
[2:02:43] BELIEVE BECAUSE YOU HEARD YOUR NAME.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; IT WAS CALLING YOUR NAME. MARK, REBECCA,
[2:02:49] JOHN, [screaming] DANIEL, EMMANUEL,
[2:02:51] WHOEVER YOUR NAME IS, IT CALL YOUR NAME.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; And that's the proof
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; that you have been quickened.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; What's a new birth? seeing the word for
[2:03:04] your day.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT BORN AGAIN UNLESS YOU SEE IT.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE OF THE ONCE YOU RECOGNIZE
[2:03:10] THE WORD OF YOUR DAY, YOU HAVE BEEN
[2:03:12] QUICKENED BY GOD HIMSELF AND GOD HAS
[2:03:15] CLAIMED YOU AS HIS SON.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; So this also proves then your origin
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; because if it proves who you are, it
[2:03:27] proves where you come from.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; And if it proves where you come from, it
[2:03:31] proves where you're going.
[2:03:33] Right?
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; Because predestination says for
[2:03:36] knowledge, right? For knowledge looks
[2:03:37] back and because he knows he knows the
[2:03:40] end from the beginning. Therefore, he
[2:03:42] predestinates.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; So your predestination or your
[2:03:46] destination that's set before pre
[2:03:48] destination is to set your destination
[2:03:51] before.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; YOUR PREDESTINATION IS BASED ON
[2:03:54] FORNOWLEDGE. AMEN.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD KNEW
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; from the beginning that when he comes in
[2:04:01] THE FLESH AND HE DIES FOR YOU, YOU will
[2:04:03] believe it.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE SENDS A MESSAGE TO BRING YOU
[2:04:07] BACK TO WHAT ADAM LOST, YOU WILL BELIEVE
[2:04:09] IT.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT IN HIS FORN
[2:04:12] KNOWLEDGE, HE TOOK YOUR NAME AND WROTE
[2:04:15] IT IN THE BOOK.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; AND HE MADE SURE THAT HE SET YOUR
[2:04:20] DESTINATION
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; like a GPS.
[2:04:24] Where are you going? I'm going to the
[2:04:26] airport.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; Destination set.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; START.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; YES, I'M WALKING. Turn left. You go
[2:04:32] left. Turn right. You turn right. KEEP
[2:04:35] GOING FOR 2 KM. KEEP GOING. TURN RIGHT.
[2:04:37] YOUR DESTINATION WAS SET BEFORE THE TRIP
[2:04:40] BEGAN.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; Sons of God ARE LED BY THE spirit of
[2:04:47] God.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; Right. Where is THE SPIRIT LEADING YOU?
[2:04:50] TO THE DESTINATION THAT WAS SENT WHEN
[2:04:53] YOU WERE PREDESTINATED.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD PUT YOUR NAME IN THE BOOK AND
[2:04:57] SAID YOUR DESTINATION is a NEW HEAVEN,
[2:05:00] THE HOLY SPIRIT CAME TO YOU TO MAKE SURE
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; YOU WILL END UP.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; THE HOLY SPIRIT WAS SENT TO MAKE SURE
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; YOU REACH THE DESTINATION.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE HOLY GHOST WAS SENT FOR.
[2:05:19] THE HOLY GHOST GOES BACK IN THE BOOK OF
[2:05:21] LIFE AND LOOKS AT THE NAMES AND THEN HE
[2:05:24] FINDS YOUR NAME AND COMES TO YOU AND SAY
[2:05:27] I'M RESPONSIBLE
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; to take you to your destination.
[2:05:34] [cheering]
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAY ONLY THOSE
[2:05:36] FILLED WITH THE HOLY Ghost will make it
[2:05:39] in the RAPTURE BECAUSE THE HOLY GHOST IS
[2:05:41] GOD'S GPS. AMEN.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; IT WAS COORDINATED BEFORE THE FOUNDATION
[2:05:45] OF THE EARTH WITH ETERNITY AS YOUR
[2:05:49] DESTINATION.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; AND THIS GPS IS NOT LIKE MAN'S GPS.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; When you can go ahead and stop and
[2:06:00] change the destination.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; This GPS, IF YOU TRY THE DESTINATION, IT
[2:06:04] SAYS permission denied.
[2:06:07] You know, but I DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE
[2:06:09] AIRPORT ANYMORE. I WANT TO GO SOMEWHERE
[2:06:11] ELSE. PERMISSION DENIED.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; THIS CAR HAS BEEN LOCKED. THE
[2:06:14] DESTINATION HAS BEEN FIXED. YOU CAN ONLY
[2:06:17] GET OUT WHEN YOU GET THERE.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; OH, I FEEL SO GOOD THIS MORNING.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; I REJOICE [screaming] THIS MORNING. I
[2:06:27] CAN SAY LIKE JESUS, FATHER, I THANK YOU
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; FOR YOU'VE HIDDEN THESE THINGS TO THE
[2:06:31] WISE AND THE PRUDENT, BUT YOU'RE MAKING
[2:06:33] THEM KNOWN UNTO US.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; I THANK YOU, FATHER, FOR MY DESOLATION.
[2:06:37] HE SAID,
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; "WINE GLAD MORNING. WHEN THIS LIFE IS
[2:06:41] OVER, I WILL FLY AWAY." [cheering]
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; I like THAT WE'RE SAYING, "I CAN'T DIE."
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; NOT I WON'T. I CAN'T.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; I CAN'T DIE.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; It's literally impossible.
[2:07:00] Father,
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; I HAVE KEPT ALL that you've given me
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; except Judas,
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; the son of predition.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; Right? That's the ASSURANCE THAT JESUS
[2:07:11] WILL NOT LOSE ANY
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; any
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; all that the father has given me will
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; come
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; and no man can pluck them out of my
[2:07:28] And I was with a brother. We were
[2:07:30] witnessing to a group of people for
[2:07:32] several weeks and he was getting very
[2:07:34] frustrated that how we're spending all
[2:07:36] this time with them and they still don't
[2:07:37] believe. He's like he's like they're not
[2:07:40] sincere. [laughter]
[2:07:42] If they're sincere, they will see it by
[2:07:44] now.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; I told him, "Brother, calm down." I
[2:07:47] said, "If they're sons, [snorts] no man
[2:07:51] can want them more than God."
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; No man. I said, "Don't think that you're
[2:07:55] so zealous to want to see them say that
[2:07:58] your zeal is greater than God's zeal." I
[2:08:01] said, "If God can be patient, so can
[2:08:03] we."
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; We don't save. WE DON'T QUICKEN. GOD IS
[2:08:08] THE ONE WHO DOESN'T.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES WE'RE LIKE, "OH, THEY'RE
[2:08:11] UNBELIEVERS. THE SERPENT SEED CAREFUL."
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE NOT BEEN CALLED TO QUICKEN
[2:08:16] SEEDS.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; ONLY GOD CAN QUICKEN SEEDS.
[2:08:21] AND AS MANY AS ARE CALLED, THEY ARE THE
[2:08:23] SONS OF GOD. AND THEY WILL BE FILLED
[2:08:26] WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT, NOT BECAUSE YOU
[2:08:28] DID IT BECAUSE GOD WILL NOT LOSE ONE.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; PARENTS WITH BACKSLIDED CHILDREN, GOD
[2:08:35] WILL NOT LOSE ONE. [screaming]
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; THAT'S MY PEACE. THAT'S MY ASSURANCE.
[2:08:40] LORD, IF THEY'RE YOURS, YOU WILL NOT
[2:08:42] LOSE ANY.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause]
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; I CAN REST assured
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; because for me there are things I was
[2:08:51] saying this brother Ray once. There are
[2:08:53] things that God is supposed to worry
[2:08:55] about. Let me just put put it that way.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; Though he doesn't worry, but there are
[2:08:59] things he's supposed to worry about, not
[2:09:01] me.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; And there are things that I'm supposed
[2:09:03] to worry about. But too often we begin
[2:09:06] to worry about the things that fall
[2:09:08] under God's umbrella.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; We have a part to play. God has a part
[2:09:13] to play.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; When God gave me his word, right, he
[2:09:18] gave me a reason to expect something,
[2:09:22] right? Because the word is what sets
[2:09:24] expectation. If I tell you, which I
[2:09:27] believe brother Moses did, he announced
[2:09:29] brother John is coming. I believe he
[2:09:30] did, right?
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; He told you he's coming to preach here,
[2:09:32] right? So then his word gave you a
[2:09:36] reason to expect me.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; Okay? You did not come up with an
[2:09:39] expectation of your own. You didn't just
[2:09:42] expect this sign that brother John is
[2:09:43] going to be here. No, that expectation
[2:09:44] was birthed by the word that you heard.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; So God is responsible for the things
[2:09:49] that I expect because of the word that
[2:09:51] he sent.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; So my responsibility is to believe what
[2:09:55] he says
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; and that's where it ends.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; His responsibility is to ensure that his
[2:10:01] word does not fall to the ground
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; because it will not return to him void.
[2:10:08] SO HE HAS TO make sure that the things
[2:10:11] he has caused me to believe.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; These are NOT THE THINGS THAT I PER
[2:10:17] ADVENTURE DECIDED I WANTED TO BELIEVE.
[2:10:19] NO, THESE ARE THINGS THAT HE CAUSED ME
[2:10:22] TO BELIEVE.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM EXPECTED TO BE A FATHER OF
[2:10:26] NATIONS BECAUSE GOD told him that.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM WAS AN IDOL WORSHIPPER. HE DID
[2:10:31] NOT THINK ABOUT IT. GOD CALLED him to
[2:10:34] handle expectation. RIGHT? SO THAT GOD
[2:10:36] WAS RESPONSIBLE TO SEE TO IT THAT WHAT
[2:10:39] HE SAID TO ABRAHAM WILL COME TO PASS.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE ASSURANCE WE HAVE IN THE WORD
[2:10:45] THAT it does not falter.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; If one thing fells to the ground, God
[2:10:50] has broken my trust.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; Because the next time he tells me
[2:10:53] something,
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; how do I know for sure?
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; This is why the word of God is not
[2:10:59] something that comes from God. The word
[2:11:01] of God is God himself. Amen.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; Because he swears by himself. God when
[2:11:09] he gives you his word, he gives you
[2:11:11] himself. He's pledging that if my word
[2:11:14] fails, then I fail.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; That's what he's saying. So rest
[2:11:18] assured, the word of God will not fail.
[2:11:20] The things that God has said concerning
[2:11:22] you will not fail.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; The things that he has said concerning
[2:11:25] your family will not fail. AND IF YOUR
[2:11:27] CHILDREN ARE SEEDS, THEY'RE A SEED. IF
[2:11:30] YOUR MOM IS SEED, SHE is seed. IF YOUR
[2:11:32] DAD IS SEED, ALL SEEDS WILL be
[2:11:34] quickened.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; They can be the vilest of vilest, the
[2:11:39] filthiest, they will be quickened.
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; Brother, I'm saying the message of
[2:11:44] grace, the sovereign grace can only be
[2:11:46] given by a sovereign one.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; And he says, what is sovereign grace? He
[2:11:50] says it's grace that does whatever it
[2:11:53] wants to. You can go read it in message
[2:11:56] of grace. Sovereign grace is what? grace
[2:11:59] that does whatever it wants to mean that
[2:12:03] you cannot say well God you can't do
[2:12:04] that says who I can do whatever I want
[2:12:08] as a matter of fact we we know the
[2:12:10] principles right that you you you have
[2:12:12] to be circumcised the Jews right and
[2:12:15] then you have to be baptized in the name
[2:12:16] of Jesus Christ and then you'll receive
[2:12:18] the gift of the Holy Ghost Acts 238
[2:12:20] right that's what Peter preached and
[2:12:23] then people put that in the box they
[2:12:26] said this is how you get the Holy Ghost
[2:12:28] If you're not baptized in the name of
[2:12:29] Jesus Christ and if you're not a Jew,
[2:12:31] you're not going to get the Holy Ghost.
[2:12:35] Then God comes to Peter in a vision and
[2:12:39] he sees all these creeping creatures. He
[2:12:41] says, "Rise up, kill and eat." Peter
[2:12:44] says, "No, Lord, you know me. I'm a Jew.
[2:12:47] No unclean things can come in my mouth.
[2:12:49] I I can't do this." He says, "Do not
[2:12:51] call unclean
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; while God has sanctified."
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, what what a vision
[2:12:57] your God is portraying to Peter. What
[2:12:59] he's thinking is Peter's thinking is
[2:13:01] that the Gentiles are unclean
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; and then salvation belongs to the Jews.
[2:13:05] That's what he's thinking. And God is
[2:13:06] says, "Uh-uh, don't call those Gentiles
[2:13:08] unclean because I can sanctify them." As
[2:13:10] a MATTER OF FACT, RISE UP.
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; FOLLOW THIS MAN.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU TO A MAN
[2:13:16] CALLED CORNELIUS. GO THERE.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; OKAY.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; PETER, IS PETER HERE? YEAH, HE'S HERE.
[2:13:21] PETER, COME. OKAY. WE WERE SENT. Let's
[2:13:24] go. They go, they get to Cornelius house
[2:13:27] and Cornelius says, I was praying and
[2:13:29] then angel came to me and said,
[2:13:31] Cornelius, God has heard your prayers,
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; but now send a man to this house. You
[2:13:36] find a man called Simon Peter. Bring him
[2:13:38] to you and he'll tell you what to do.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; Imagine God sending an angel down with a
[2:13:42] message to Cornelius to go say, "Go get
[2:13:45] another man."
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, man is the expression
[2:13:49] of God, not angel. It's man. An angel
[2:13:51] could not come and give Cornelius the
[2:13:53] Holy Ghost. He couldn't do it. He could
[2:13:55] only come WITH A MESSAGE. SAYS,
[2:13:56] "CORNELIUS, I HAVE COME BECAUSE GOD HAS
[2:13:58] HEARD YOUR PRAYER, BUT YOU'RE GOING TO
[2:14:00] NEED ANOTHER MAN." [screaming]
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; Peter comes and begins to preach a word.
[2:14:05] Right? And then THE BIBLE SAYS, "WHILE
[2:14:08] PETER YET SPAKE THOSE WORDS,
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE UPPER ROOM,
[2:14:15] THE HOLY GHOST IS NOW GOING TO FALL ON
[2:14:17] PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT EVEN BAPTIZED,
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; that are not even circumcised.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOT EVEN A scripture for them."
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE SCRIPTURE that Peter GAVE
[2:14:29] WAS TO BE BAPTIZED FIRST, THEN YOU WILL
[2:14:32] GET THE HOLY GHOST. THESE ONES GET THE
[2:14:34] HOLY GHOST FIRST, THEN THEY GET
[2:14:36] BAPTIZED.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; WOW.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; What's that? Sovereign grace.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; It's grace THAT CAN DO WHATEVER IT WANTS
[2:14:43] TO.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; IF GOD WANTS TO FILL SOMEBODY WITH THE
[2:14:45] HOLY GHOST NOW, HE WILL FILL THEM WITH
[2:14:47] THE HOLY GHOST NOW.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; AND THEN YOU CAN SAY, "WHY? THEY DON'T
[2:14:51] EVEN COME TO CHURCH. THIS IS THE FIRST
[2:14:52] TIME IN CHURCH." HE CAN FILL THEM
[2:14:53] ANYWAYS
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE CAN DO WHATEVER HE WANTS TO.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; What happened in Hides home?
[2:15:02] Tell me
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; those boys
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; last I checked they were laughing
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; they were scoffers they were mocking
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; God came in that room sister had started
[2:15:13] crying while the other sister was crying
[2:15:14] the presence of God says power came in
[2:15:17] that room that that room almost fell
[2:15:19] apart
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; and those boys are laughing
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; at the presence of God
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; and they're laughing
[2:15:27] and then Hadira says it's nothing but
[2:15:29] the truth Yeah.
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; And God says, "Give her whatever she
[2:15:33] wants."
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; Now, God didn't give any parameters to
[2:15:38] he says whatever she wants. He's true to
[2:15:42] his word.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; Everybody said, "I want the salvation of
[2:15:46] my two children." God came to two boys.
[2:15:50] They were mockers, scoffers,
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; laughing at God without them repenting,
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; without them apologizing, without them
[2:15:59] thinking about what they've done wrong,
[2:16:00] without them going to church, without
[2:16:02] them going to an altar call, without
[2:16:04] anybody LAYING HANDS ON THEM AND FILL
[2:16:06] THEM WITH THE HOLY GHOST THEN AND THEN.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; SOVEREIGN GRACE CAN DO WHATEVER IT WANTS
[2:16:14] TO. GOD CAN FEEL WHOEVER, WHENEVER,
[2:16:17] HOWEVER, WHEREVER.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; HE CAN FEEL YOU IN CHURCH. HE CAN FEEL
[2:16:21] YOU AT HOME. HE CAN FEEL YOU AT WORK. HE
[2:16:24] CAN FEEL YOU IN THE BAR.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; SOVEREIGN.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; But this tells me then had it right. Why
[2:16:33] should you really ask? I want the
[2:16:36] attributes
[2:16:38] that laid in God
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; that were not made manifest
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; to be quickened in my sons.
[2:16:44] That's what she really asked. WHAT DO
[2:16:46] YOU WANT, SISTER? I WANT TWO NAMES IN
[2:16:48] THE BOOK TO BE CALLED.
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; AND GOD CALLED [screaming] THOSE NAMES
[2:16:52] AND THEY WERE QUICKENED.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; DO YOU WANT TO PRAY FOR SOMEBODY? THAT'S
[2:16:55] HOW YOU PRAY. LORD, I WANT THE NAME. IF
[2:16:59] THEIR NAMES ARE IN THE BOOK, I
[2:17:01] [screaming] WANT THE HOLY GHOST TO GO BY
[2:17:02] AND QUICKEN THOSE NAMES THAT ARE IN THE
[2:17:05] BOOK. [cheering and applause]
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; Because those names are the eternal one
[2:17:10] made manifest IN THE FLESH. GOD'S
[2:17:13] POTENTIALS. He had the potential to
[2:17:15] become you and I.
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; And now he is you and I.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; And the saddest story of the Bible, Adam
[2:17:22] and Eve being kicked out. Now I've been
[2:17:24] restored.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; It started with Adam and Eve. It ends
[2:17:28] with Adam and Eve.
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; Because the last chapter of the Bible is
[2:17:32] the spirit and the bride. Say
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; come.
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; That's it. And there's been an
[2:17:37] invitation said to come to the wedding
[2:17:39] supper of the lamb. COME. I'LL SHOW YOU
[2:17:42] THE BRIDE. THE WIFE'S LAMB. THE LAMB'S
[2:17:45] WIFE. WHO AM I PREACHING TO? THE BRIDE.
[2:17:49] THE LAMB'S WIFE. [cheering]
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; THE PURPOSE THAT GOD HAD IN HIMSELF.
[2:17:54] BROTHER SAID THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF GOD IS
[2:17:57] TO GET A BREAD OF HIS OWN CHOOSING.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Can I take two minutes?
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; Two minutes to expound. Let's start
[2:18:04] here. AMEN.
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; THE HEART PURPOSE OF God is not just to
[2:18:09] get a bride,
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; but it's to get a bride of his own
[2:18:12] choosing.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; You can read that in the church book.
[2:18:14] I'm not making this up. If you want to
[2:18:16] put it on the screen somewhere, you can
[2:18:17] find it. Is to choose is to pick up a
[2:18:19] bride of his own choosing.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; You know what that means? That means to
[2:18:23] me that the bride that Christ ends up
[2:18:26] with You can Do you want Do you want the
[2:18:28] quote? I can find it for you if you
[2:18:29] want. Okay, I see the bird looking for
[2:18:30] you. Type on choosing and you'll find
[2:18:32] it. on choosing.
[2:18:36] Hey, let's just read it together. Two
[2:18:39] O's.
[2:18:43] Yeah.
[2:18:45] Search. No, you're searching the title.
[2:18:48] So, you want to search the quotes. There
[2:18:49] you go. On choosing.
[2:18:53] Okay. Do exact search exact phrase this.
[2:18:57] Yeah. Uh, keep scroll down. Try to find
[2:19:00] in the church's book and you'll find it
[2:19:01] somewhere there. It's in this minor
[2:19:03] churches book I think.
[2:19:08] Uh I think you passed it. I think I saw
[2:19:09] it somewhere.
[2:19:11] Okay, I'll let you search for it on
[2:19:13] choosing and you can actually add a
[2:19:14] bride if you want another keyword bride
[2:19:16] on choosing but then you have to remove
[2:19:17] the exact search and I want to find this
[2:19:20] code for you because
[2:19:22] I have it here.
[2:19:25] It'll be good to read it all together.
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:42] Okay. Smina churches. I got it for you.
[2:19:45] It's uh Yeah. Sme churches. You can get
[2:19:48] it in there.
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; Did you find it?
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; Okay. It says this this choosing of the
[2:20:00] bride was purpose in himself. Ephesians
[2:20:02] 1 verse 9 and in Romans it says and in
[2:20:06] Romans 9:11 it says that the purpose of
[2:20:09] God according to election might stand.
[2:20:11] You can't read it any other way.
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; You have it. There you go. You can't
[2:20:16] read it any other way. THE HEART
[2:20:18] PURPOSE, THE ETERNAL PURPOSE OF GOD WAS
[2:20:22] TO TAKE a bride of his
[2:20:27] capital O W N his own choosing and that
[2:20:30] purpose was in himself and being eternal
[2:20:32] was decreed before the foundational
[2:20:33] world. Okay. He says you cannot read it
[2:20:35] any other way. Which means that the
[2:20:37] bride that God has in this last days was
[2:20:40] not a bride that was given to him.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; Was not a bride that he ended up with.
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; WAS NOT A BRIDE THAT A RESULT OF
[2:20:50] SOMEBODY giving him THE BRIDE. THE BRIDE
[2:20:52] THAT HE ENDS UP WITH WAS NOT A A mistake
[2:20:55] or per chance or per adventure or THE
[2:20:58] FATHER SAYING, "HERE'S YOUR BRIDE. GO
[2:21:00] MARRY HER." NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. THE
[2:21:02] BRIDE THAT GOD HAS IN HIS LAST DAYS IS A
[2:21:04] BRIDE WHO IS THE result of a deliberate
[2:21:09] choice.
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; You can't READ IT ANY OTHER WAY. WHICH
[2:21:14] MEANS IF YOU ARE THE BRIDE, YOU'RE NOT
[2:21:16] ACCIDENTALLY THE BRIDE. YOU DID NOT JUST
[2:21:19] ENDED UP IN THE BRIDE. YOU DO NOT HAPPEN
[2:21:22] TO BE THE BRIDE. SOMEBODY PUT YOU IN THE
[2:21:24] BREAD.
[2:21:25] &gt;&gt; And the person WHO PUT YOU THERE CHOSE
[2:21:28] YOU.
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; Handpicked you.
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; DELIBERATE CHOICE.
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE THE BRIDE OF HIS OWN CHOOSING.
[2:21:38] IT WASN'T ME MINI ME ANYWAY. IT WASN'T
[2:21:39] like you you maybe not you, you maybe
[2:21:41] not you. No. God says I want you and you
[2:21:45] and you and you AND YOU AND HE PICKED
[2:21:49] YOU.
[2:21:50] AMEN.
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; HE CHOSE YOU FOR HIMSELF.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE THE CHOICE OF GOD
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; according to the purpose of election.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; I love the word the election of grace
[2:22:02] because election means that there was a
[2:22:04] vote.
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; When there's an election, it means there
[2:22:08] there are candidates
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; and then the people go and then they
[2:22:11] choose who won.
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; One and one the people have spoken the
[2:22:16] person that was chosen is elected.
[2:22:18] Right? So the election of grace means
[2:22:20] that there is many people on the earth
[2:22:23] and God held an election and grace chose
[2:22:28] who he [snorts] wanted.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; Now unlike human elections where it's
[2:22:33] based on a campaign where you have to
[2:22:35] sell yourself so you win.
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; This election is based on grace
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; where you did not have to do anything.
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; You did not convince God to choose you.
[2:22:44] YOU ARE NOT SO GOOD THAT GOD CHOSE YOU.
[2:22:46] NO, GRACE CAME AND HELD AN ELECTION and
[2:22:48] then grace chose you.
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; You won
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; and then you makes it you make IT IN THE
[2:22:56] BRIDE BECAUSE YOU ARE HIS OWN CHOOSING.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil minimize who you are
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; and don't let the devil tell you that
[2:23:07] you are less than what you are.
[2:23:09] &gt;&gt; Humility is not refusing what God is
[2:23:12] calling you to be because you you're too
[2:23:14] humble. Uhhuh.
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; It's not, oh, I'm so humble. I don't
[2:23:18] want to say I'm perfect. Nobody's
[2:23:19] perfect.
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; If God calls you perfect,
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; you are.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; Humility is not like I'm not I'm not
[2:23:26] worthy. If God calls you worthy, you
[2:23:28] are. You know, brother says you're
[2:23:29] worthy.
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; You know, he says that and it says that
[2:23:31] in the Hebrew worthy means a scale. It
[2:23:34] means that you put somebody on the
[2:23:35] balance and then God put Jesus on the
[2:23:37] balance and the balance went like that,
[2:23:38] right? And then he put you on the other
[2:23:40] side and you went like this and then you
[2:23:43] and Christ match. That's what worthy
[2:23:45] means. You are both worthy. You're
[2:23:47] equal. Means that you are what completes
[2:23:49] him.
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; Without you, he could not be complete.
[2:23:52] And the one who was self-existing, who
[2:23:54] dwelt alone, is never going back to that
[2:23:57] form again.
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; Ever.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; Once sin is over and we're back into
[2:24:02] eternity, there's going to be nobody
[2:24:04] sick that needs healing.
[2:24:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:06] &gt;&gt; There's going to be nobody lost that
[2:24:08] needs salvation.
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; All these attributes are going back to
[2:24:12] dormant again. because they're all being
[2:24:15] expressed for a purpose and that purpose
[2:24:17] is achieved. But you know what remains?
[2:24:19] Husband and wife
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; in him. He wanted to be a husband
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; and he wanted to have a wife. Those are
[2:24:27] the two things that remain. And when you
[2:24:29] reign with him is husband and wife. It's
[2:24:32] not redeemer and loss and healer and no
[2:24:34] those attributes HAVE DONE THE WORK. BUT
[2:24:36] GOD IS YOUR HUSBAND. THAT'S WHY he is
[2:24:39] love is based on love.
[2:24:43] The message of the hour is the
[2:24:45] expression of God's love to us.
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; It's the fullness of love that's been
[2:24:50] restored back to the church. What is the
[2:24:51] capstone?
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; Love,
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; right? Okay. Then you mean to tell me
[2:24:55] that in all the other church ages, they
[2:24:57] did not have love. That's not what it
[2:24:59] means, right?
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; They had love because love is the Holy
[2:25:02] Spirit, right? But what the capsule
[2:25:04] means is that in this last days, it's
[2:25:06] the fullness of God's love
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; that's been expressed to us. And how did
[2:25:12] God express his love to us? By telling
[2:25:14] us his thoughts. There's no more secrets
[2:25:16] between you and I and him. He tells us
[2:25:18] all his secrets. And that's how he shows
[2:25:20] us that we are his bride.
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; He whispers secrets that the churches
[2:25:24] know nothing about.
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[2:25:31] [applause]
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; I hope something was said
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; this morning that was a blessing to you.
[2:25:37] The song may come.
[2:25:40] Hallelujah.
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; I am so thankful for the message.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; Because the message came and told me who
[2:25:47] I am.
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; Religion and churches lied to me. They
[2:25:54] portrayed God to be somebody that he was
[2:25:56] not.
[2:25:57] &gt;&gt; And God came and set the record
[2:25:58] straight. He says, "I want you to forget
[2:26:00] this way of thinking. What they told you
[2:26:02] about me is not true. I am not three. I
[2:26:06] am one.
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; I am not all wrath. I am love. I'm not
[2:26:10] judgment. I am mercy. I am peace. I am
[2:26:13] grace. He told me how to really think
[2:26:15] about him. And then he tells me that
[2:26:17] this whole Bible really is about me.
[2:26:21] The story of redemption is about you
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; and I.
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; God's purpose was to dwell with men.
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; That's why the book of Revelation says
[2:26:31] God's tabernacle is with men. God wanted
[2:26:34] to dwell in human flesh and the Holy
[2:26:38] Spirit paved the way for that to happen
[2:26:40] because now your soul has been washed
[2:26:41] and sanctified that the Holy Spirit
[2:26:42] himself can dwell in you [music] and
[2:26:44] then he can mature you to be a son of
[2:26:46] God. As many as received him to them
[2:26:49] [music] gave you power to become the
[2:26:51] sons of God which is why we are. So walk
[2:26:54] out of this place knowing who you are.
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; Knowing that your life is in God's
[2:26:58] [music] hands, knowing that whatever the
[2:27:00] devil does in your life is not his own
[2:27:02] doing. is God allowed? And stop giving
[2:27:05] the devil any time to think about the
[2:27:07] things he's doing. It's not him. It's
[2:27:09] God. Your relationship and your dealings
[2:27:11] are only with God. You don't even worry
[2:27:13] about the devil. The devil is nothing.
[2:27:16] You are everything to God.
[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; Are you wanting to close, brother?
[2:27:25] [applause]
[2:27:26] Whoever I works. Whoever wants to come
[2:27:28] and close. [music]
[2:27:30] Glorious
[2:27:35] glory
[2:27:39] [music and singing]
[2:27:47] throne. [music]
[2:27:49] My life is no longer mine. I'm a
[2:27:53] prisoner of love divine.
[2:27:56] And now I live
[2:28:00] to praise his name.
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:04] &gt;&gt; Who am I, Lord?
[2:28:07] Who am I?
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; I can [music and singing] see now
[2:28:14] who I am.
[2:28:17] A part of [music] my Savior, [singing]
[2:28:21] a part of his word.
[2:28:24] It's a revelation
[2:28:28] of who I am.
[2:28:31] On Calary, [singing]
[2:28:33] he died to redeem his lost bride. The
[2:28:38] King of Kings
[2:28:42] became my Savior.
[2:28:45] This is first mystery
[2:28:48] of love expressed to me that Christ and
[2:28:53] I
[2:28:55] might be made one.
[2:28:59] Who am I, Lord?
[2:29:02] Who I am.
[2:29:06] I can see [music and singing] now
[2:29:09] who I am.
[2:29:11] I am. I'm a part of my savior, [singing]
[2:29:16] a part of his word.
[2:29:19] It's a reation
[2:29:22] of who I am.
[2:29:27] &gt;&gt; My what a revelation we have received.
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; Praise God for the message of the hour.
[2:29:35] &gt;&gt; How many believe it? Amen.
[2:29:37] &gt;&gt; And God is revealing and manifesting his
[2:29:41] attributes.
[2:29:43] &gt;&gt; Now we are the sons of God.
[2:29:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:47] &gt;&gt; Not tomorrow.
[2:29:48] &gt;&gt; Now we are. Oh, how we enjoyed it.
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, how we revel in this revelation.
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; Say hallelujah.
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; Can you SAY PRAISE THE LORD?
[2:30:01] PRAISE THE LORD FOR THIS WORD THAT WE
[2:30:03] HAVE RECEIVED IN THIS END TIME. GOD IS
[2:30:06] REAL. HIS POWER IS REAL. THE HOLY GHOST
[2:30:09] IS HERE THIS MORNING.
[2:30:12] &gt;&gt; Praise his wonderful name. He is
[2:30:15] wonderful. Let's sing that chorus. He is
[2:30:17] wonder, wonderful, wonderful.
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; Jesus is to me. Amen.
[2:30:23] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[2:30:24] Wonderful. [music and singing] Jesus is
[2:30:27] to me.

[2:30:32] mighty God is he. Oh, saving me, keeping
[2:30:37] me [music]
[2:30:38] from all sin [singing] and shame.

[2:31:09] [singing] his [music] name.
[2:31:12] My heart sings today. Sings for joy in
[2:31:16] gladness.
[2:31:17] Jesus [music and singing] saves,
[2:31:19] satisfies,
[2:31:20] vanishes my sadness. Guilt is gone.
[2:31:25] Peace is mine. Peace to you like a
[2:31:28] river.
[2:31:29] Jesus is so wonderful and mighty
[2:31:32] [music and singing]
[2:31:33] to deliver.
[2:31:35] Wonderful, wonderful.
[2:31:38] [singing and music] Jesus is to be the

[2:32:11] Oh, what strange grace has wrought in my
[2:32:15] lowly [music]
[2:32:16] station since my soul has received

[2:32:37] UNVEILED BEFORE US. HALLELUJAH.

[2:32:49] &gt;&gt; OH, LET'S PRAISE THE LORD THIS MORNING.
[2:32:52] HALLELUJAH. Raise your hand and SAY,
[2:32:54] "THANK YOU, LORD, [screaming] THAT I'M
[2:32:55] PART OF YOU, LORD. I'M PART OF YOUR
[2:32:58] THOUGHTS. I'M PART OF YOUR WORD." PRAISE
[2:33:01] your name, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Lord,
[2:33:04] we thank you this morning. Oh, for the
[2:33:07] WORD OF GOD THAT WE HAVE HEARD, LORD. WE
[2:33:09] BELIEVE IT WITH ALL OF OUR HEARTS, LORD.
[2:33:13] Every part of it, Lord Jesus.
[2:33:16] Your thoughts were dormant one time, but
[2:33:19] Lord, here we are. Oh, God. We are
[2:33:22] manifesting you in the flesh. Thank you,
[2:33:26] Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah.
[2:33:30] Praise your wonderful name. Hallelujah.
[2:33:33] Praise God. He's so wonderful. my
[2:33:37] brother and your my sister.
[2:33:40] Amen. Let's bow our head just for one
[2:33:42] moment. I think this is a time. Amen. If
[2:33:45] you are a seed of God,
[2:33:49] you'll respond to the word of God this
[2:33:51] morning. If there's somebody here this
[2:33:54] morning that needs prayer and say,
[2:33:56] "Lord, I'm coming back to you. I've been
[2:34:00] I've gone wayward. Lord, I won't want to
[2:34:03] come back to you. Lord, would you raise
[2:34:06] your hand this morning? Is there
[2:34:08] somebody here that was touched this
[2:34:10] morning? You are seed AND YOU ARE COMING
[2:34:13] BACK to Jesus Christ this morning. This
[2:34:16] word was not spoken in vain. It was
[2:34:19] spoken for a purpose. It was spoken to
[2:34:22] the seed of God.
[2:34:24] If you have been touched this morning
[2:34:28] and you want to be filled with the Holy
[2:34:30] Spirit, you want the life of God to come
[2:34:33] into your life because without that
[2:34:35] life, you're not going.
[2:34:38] You need the life. You need the Holy
[2:34:40] Spirit in your life. And may the Lord
[2:34:43] just come and quicken that word in you.
[2:34:46] Is there somebody here this morning?
[2:34:51] Let's just all pray together.
[2:34:53] Father in heaven, we're so grateful this
[2:34:57] morning
[2:34:59] for your precious word.
[2:35:02] You're the great Elohim. Yes, you always
[2:35:05] were and you always will be the great
[2:35:07] Elohim.
[2:35:09] But Lord Jesus,
[2:35:11] you become Emmanuel,
[2:35:14] God with us. And God is with us here
[2:35:18] this morning in the form of the Holy
[2:35:20] Spirit. You are here. You Lord, you said
[2:35:23] you would come and you have fulfilled
[2:35:26] your promise even this morning. We feel
[2:35:29] you in our heart. It's not by feeling,
[2:35:31] BUT WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE WITHIN US, LORD.
[2:35:35] And we can know by the fruits that we
[2:35:38] bear
[2:35:39] by by believing the word of the hour,
[2:35:42] Lord. How precious this word is to us.
[2:35:46] Blessed be the name of our Lord Jesus
[2:35:49] Christ. Glory to thy wonderful name.
[2:35:53] Glory to thy name, Lord. That you are
[2:35:57] our savior. You're our provider. You're
[2:36:00] Jehovah Gyra.
[2:36:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah to the name of Jesus.
[2:36:07] We worship you here this morning. Oh
[2:36:10] God, we want that relationship to be a
[2:36:12] closer relationship in our life. Lord,
[2:36:16] you want us to have that bride
[2:36:18] relationship, that husband and bride re
[2:36:21] wife relationship.
[2:36:23] We pray, oh God, in Jesus' name.
[2:36:26] Hallelujah.
[2:36:28] Amen. Isn't it too bad we've come to a
[2:36:31] close of the service? I could have heard
[2:36:33] some more.
[2:36:36] Amen. That's what I've been preaching
[2:36:37] about all these years, right? Amen. How
[2:36:40] many can say that? That happened here
[2:36:42] just in a different way.
[2:36:45] But we have believed it. Amen. This word
[2:36:47] is is wonderful. Praises your wonderful
[2:36:50] name, Jesus. Hallelujah. Amen. We want
[2:36:54] to give some time to our brother to give
[2:36:56] his testimony. I think that's [music]
[2:36:58] what brother Moses was saying. Is that
[2:37:00] is are you going to give your testimony
[2:37:01] yet?
[2:37:04] Yeah, that's what I'm hearing, too.
[2:37:05] [laughter]
[2:37:06] Amen. I was kind of surprised to be
[2:37:08] called up here this this morning, but
[2:37:11] what did you want to say?
[2:37:18] I think it was after service for the
[2:37:19] youth.
[2:37:20] &gt;&gt; So if anyone would like to stay in here
[2:37:21] that they they're welcome to. But it's
[2:37:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah. This was for the youth, but I want
[2:37:26] to be here. I want to be part of those
[2:37:28] the youth. How many want to hear that
[2:37:30] that testimony?
[2:37:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:37:32] &gt;&gt; I want to hear this testimony.
[2:37:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'M PART OF THE YOUTH. AMEN.
[2:37:37] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. POTENTIALLY I'M PART
[2:37:40] OF THE YOUTH.
[2:37:41] &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. HALLELUJAH.
[2:37:44] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE LIFE OF GOD IS IN ME.
[2:37:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Praise God. So, we're going
[2:37:49] to close it. Amen. And then, brother,
[2:37:52] you could just come here and give your
[2:37:53] testimony.
[2:37:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Bless the people, Lord,
[2:37:56] and go with us. Those that want to go in
[2:37:59] the name of Jesus, Lord, may they go and
[2:38:01] be blessed. And may we word of God with
[2:38:04] us. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. And
[2:38:08] amen. You may be seated. Come, brother.
[2:38:11] Amen. be free to close the service.
[2:38:14] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:38:18] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to share this quickly for
[2:38:20] 15 minutes, I think. I'm going to ask
[2:38:22] brother Ray to sing one more song for me
[2:38:23] that I really want to hear. Is that
[2:38:24] okay? After.
[2:38:25] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:38:27] &gt;&gt; So, I'll
[2:38:30] do you want to do this now or after? Oh,
[2:38:32] let's do after at the end so we can
[2:38:33] rejoice and go. Uh, well, first I'd like
[2:38:36] to say thank you again for having me
[2:38:37] here today. This is it's one of those
[2:38:39] days I'm not going to forget. uh you
[2:38:40] really had a good time here. You're a
[2:38:42] wonderful church. You love the word and
[2:38:44] you can always tell the quality of the
[2:38:46] church by how the Holy Spirit will use
[2:38:48] the gift.
[2:38:49] &gt;&gt; Uh a lot of things that were said today
[2:38:50] were were coming because you're pulling
[2:38:52] those things. So,
[2:38:53] &gt;&gt; we really thank God for that and trust
[2:38:54] this is not the last time I'm going to
[2:38:56] be here.
[2:38:56] &gt;&gt; Hope to see you again someday.
[2:38:59] &gt;&gt; Um I just gave my my testimony. I was
[2:39:02] born in well, we say the message, but I
[2:39:04] don't believe you're born in the message
[2:39:05] until you're born again.
[2:39:06] &gt;&gt; So, I would say I was born in the
[2:39:08] message church. They say that way. My my
[2:39:10] my parents were believers. Uh my dad was
[2:39:12] a Catholic. My mom was a Protestant and
[2:39:14] they both came into the message before I
[2:39:16] was born. Then I was born uh as the
[2:39:19] first child born in the message. I had
[2:39:21] three siblings before me. And then I was
[2:39:23] born in in the Congo. There's the
[2:39:26] Democratic Republic of Congo and then
[2:39:28] there is the Republic of Congo. Most
[2:39:30] people don't know the two different
[2:39:31] countries but but they are. So I come
[2:39:32] from the smaller one about uh four
[2:39:34] million people. That's where I was born
[2:39:36] and I grew up in the message church. Uh
[2:39:39] I believe it was around 11 11 years old
[2:39:42] that I got baptized. I get mad and got
[2:39:44] baptized. And then around 14 is when the
[2:39:48] message came by my way as really being
[2:39:51] more than what mom and dad believed. You
[2:39:53] know there there's I was I was in a
[2:39:55] service I remember that service for the
[2:39:56] rest of my life where the Holy Spirit
[2:39:58] was moving such a such an incredible way
[2:40:00] that the way it came to me was this
[2:40:03] message is the truth. And it wasn't mom
[2:40:06] and dad believe this. This was this is
[2:40:09] what I believe. And the joy that filled
[2:40:12] my heart. I can never explain what it
[2:40:14] was like because all I could do was cry.
[2:40:17] Just tears coming the entire service. At
[2:40:19] the end of the service when we're
[2:40:21] greeting one another outside, I was just
[2:40:22] just tears. They asked me why you're
[2:40:24] crying. I said I'm just so happy. There
[2:40:26] just something that just settled. It's
[2:40:27] like this is the truth and I found it.
[2:40:30] Right. And then uh you know as a
[2:40:33] teenager I went through my struggles as
[2:40:34] a teenager and then I went to university
[2:40:37] in South Africa when I was about 18
[2:40:39] years old. Uh that's when I started
[2:40:41] going the wrong the wrong way. Uh I did
[2:40:44] not know there was churches there but it
[2:40:46] was my first time being away from home.
[2:40:48] And then you know sometimes you go to
[2:40:50] church and sometimes you don't go to
[2:40:51] church. And then the less you go to
[2:40:52] church the more the devil has a hole on
[2:40:53] you the less you feed on the word. And
[2:40:56] then I went astray and I ended up in
[2:40:58] Australia for university. And that's
[2:41:00] when uh the furthest I've ever been from
[2:41:02] God was in Australia. And it's not so
[2:41:05] much in the things that I was doing, but
[2:41:06] it is more about the the golf that was
[2:41:09] between me and God that that gap was so
[2:41:12] so big that the only way I can describe
[2:41:14] it is that I think I lost even the
[2:41:17] consciousness of God. Let me put it that
[2:41:19] way. I live my life as though there was
[2:41:21] no God. Like I wasn't even thinking what
[2:41:23] would God do? Is God about what gossip.
[2:41:25] I did not think about God when I woke
[2:41:27] up. I did not think about God when I
[2:41:28] went to bed. It's just there's just like
[2:41:29] no nothing there. But when you're seed,
[2:41:32] you're seed,
[2:41:33] &gt;&gt; right? God will not lose you. And then
[2:41:37] you can go years and years and years
[2:41:38] without praying. You don't even know how
[2:41:40] to pray anymore. That doesn't stop God.
[2:41:43] &gt;&gt; God will still find you because like I
[2:41:44] said, he's already in you potentially.
[2:41:47] So when I was going to school, I was
[2:41:49] going to school with God. When I came
[2:41:50] back home, he was there. He was always
[2:41:52] there even though I was no longer aware
[2:41:54] of it. Right? When you receive the Holy
[2:41:56] Ghost, now you become aware that you're
[2:41:57] a son of God. You always were. But now
[2:42:00] that awareness is the power that drives
[2:42:02] you, right? So I remember now I I my
[2:42:06] life was going very good in university.
[2:42:08] I was a straight A student. Uh there was
[2:42:10] a company that came on campus. Uh they
[2:42:13] wanted to recruit like uh new graduates
[2:42:15] and then I was one of the ones that were
[2:42:17] selected. It was going to be in my field
[2:42:19] and they say, "Okay, you have a couple
[2:42:20] years left. we want you to finish, but
[2:42:22] you have a job offer here waiting for
[2:42:23] you. We'll do all the paperwork for you
[2:42:25] and everything. I met with the CTO of
[2:42:27] the company. As far as I was, as far as
[2:42:29] I was concerned, my life was set. I was
[2:42:31] going to live in Australia for the rest
[2:42:32] of my life. That was my plan. Just I'm
[2:42:34] going to finish. I'm going to get a job
[2:42:35] in this company. I'm going to become a
[2:42:36] citizen. I'm just going to live here,
[2:42:37] live my life here. But that very
[2:42:40] semester, I just finished my exams. And
[2:42:43] then I I was heading back back from
[2:42:47] school, I believe, in the bus. It was a
[2:42:49] far about 45 minute pass, right? And I
[2:42:51] used to usually I sit by the window
[2:42:53] because I just like to look outside. And
[2:42:54] I sat by the window and I just looking
[2:42:56] outside and I just closed my eyes and I
[2:42:57] just fell asleep.
[2:42:59] And I heard this voice as clear as you
[2:43:02] hear mine. It said, "Go back home until
[2:43:05] I tell you what to do." That's what it
[2:43:07] said. "Return back home until I tell you
[2:43:10] what to do." And I was very aware that
[2:43:12] God had spoken to me. So for the first
[2:43:16] time in I don't know how long So I I
[2:43:18] found my mom and dad and I say, "I'm
[2:43:20] coming back home." I said, "Uh, no
[2:43:23] you're not." I said, "Yes, I am." They
[2:43:26] said, "That's not going to happen." Like
[2:43:28] we we worked so hard to send you to
[2:43:31] university there. We spent so much
[2:43:33] money. You are going to finish and
[2:43:35] you're going to stay there. I was like,
[2:43:37] "It's not going to happen. God told me
[2:43:39] to come back home." So eventually they
[2:43:41] let me come back home. And I went back
[2:43:43] home. At the time, my parents were
[2:43:44] living in. So that's why I went back.
[2:43:48] And then my dad said, "Well, you can't
[2:43:49] stay home. Like you need to finish
[2:43:50] school. Like what are you doing here?
[2:43:52] Where do you want to go?" I said, "I
[2:43:54] don't know." He says, "How about do you
[2:43:57] go to the UK? There's some good schools
[2:43:59] there." I said, "No, not the UK." He
[2:44:01] says, "What do you want to do?" I said,
[2:44:03] "Stay home until I tell you what to do."
[2:44:05] Those are my instructions, right? Go
[2:44:07] home until I tell you what to do. So, I
[2:44:08] wasn't going to make a plan until God
[2:44:10] told me what to do. So, I wasn't like
[2:44:13] serving God by any means or anything. I
[2:44:14] just obeyed. I obey the commandment. And
[2:44:17] this is key to my testimony is that I
[2:44:18] obey the commandment. And when I came
[2:44:20] back home and I prayed and I said to the
[2:44:22] Lord, I don't know what you're doing in
[2:44:24] my life. I don't know who you are and I
[2:44:26] know that I'm not where I'm supposed to
[2:44:27] be, but I know one thing. You've asked
[2:44:28] me to come back here until you tell me
[2:44:31] what to do and that's what I'm going to
[2:44:32] do. Then about five months in, my dad
[2:44:36] said, uh, what about this country or
[2:44:38] this country? I said no to all the
[2:44:39] different countries he was mentioning.
[2:44:40] Then one day he said, what do you think
[2:44:42] about Canada? And when he say that
[2:44:44] something just click in my soul says go.
[2:44:47] I said Canada is a place that's where
[2:44:49] I'm supposed to be. So we we made the
[2:44:51] paperwork and did everything.
[2:44:52] Supernaturally God allowed me to come in
[2:44:55] a way that it's very uh impossible to
[2:44:57] explain in the time that we have today.
[2:45:00] But I went through an agency that chose
[2:45:04] what city, what university, they chose
[2:45:07] everything. So I if it was my own
[2:45:10] choosing I probably would not come to
[2:45:11] Vancouver because what does Vancouver
[2:45:13] like I was probably looking at Montreal
[2:45:15] and Ottawa that's what I was looking at.
[2:45:16] So they chose uh Vancouver and then they
[2:45:20] chose Saf University which is key to
[2:45:23] what everything I'm about to share today
[2:45:24] because they were the one who chose
[2:45:26] that. It was not me. So I came to
[2:45:29] Vancouver. I did not even know there was
[2:45:30] a message church in Vancouver. Uh a
[2:45:33] brother picked me up from the airport
[2:45:34] and he let me stay with him for a couple
[2:45:36] days and says I'm going to church on
[2:45:37] Sunday. would like to come. Oh, there's
[2:45:38] a church here. Say, yeah, this church is
[2:45:39] brother Ed Bisco. Then I remember
[2:45:41] hearing my brother Ed Bisco when I was a
[2:45:43] kid. Like, oh, I would love to come. So
[2:45:46] then we went to church and brother Ed
[2:45:48] preached that service. And then it just
[2:45:50] felt like I was where I was supposed to
[2:45:52] be. It just felt like, you know,
[2:45:54] sometimes when God does something, you
[2:45:55] don't understand it, but you aware that
[2:45:58] some God is doing something. I mean, I
[2:45:59] know what I'm talking about. As
[2:46:00] Christians, you you have that sense like
[2:46:02] God is God is doing something. I'm not
[2:46:04] quite sure what. And that's what it was
[2:46:06] for me. I knew that God was doing
[2:46:07] something in me being there. And then
[2:46:10] I'll come to church and I'll disappear
[2:46:12] for a few months and I come to church
[2:46:13] and I disappear for a few weeks and I
[2:46:14] come to church. There's always a desire
[2:46:17] to, you know, then the desire started
[2:46:19] growing to serve God again. I was like,
[2:46:20] I'm not so sure. Like my fear was what
[2:46:23] if I come back to church and I started
[2:46:25] serving God again and then I backslide
[2:46:27] again. Like that was my fear. I was
[2:46:29] like, well, do I really want to do this?
[2:46:30] Like I've I've done alter calls. I've
[2:46:33] been to the altar. I've cried a little
[2:46:34] bit. Young people know what I'm talking
[2:46:35] about, right? You go to the altar, you
[2:46:37] cry, and you're like, "Okay, I'm changed
[2:46:39] now." You go home, everything is good
[2:46:40] for what? For one week, for a month, and
[2:46:42] then you're back square one again. Like,
[2:46:45] you get so discouraged. And then you try
[2:46:46] again. And then you try again, right? At
[2:46:48] that point, I was tired. I'm like, I'm
[2:46:49] not going to do this again. I'm I'm
[2:46:50] done. So, one day, Wednesday night,
[2:46:54] which I I never came to church
[2:46:55] Wednesdays, but that day I decided to
[2:46:56] just show up on a Wednesday night.
[2:46:58] Brother Tom Ray, as a pastor, was was
[2:47:00] speaking and he started was kept in his
[2:47:02] peace. And in his in his opening
[2:47:04] comments, he said, "Peace is not the
[2:47:06] absence of trouble." He says, "Peace is
[2:47:09] the presence of God." And those words
[2:47:11] really grip me. It's not the absence of
[2:47:12] trouble. It's the presence of God. In
[2:47:14] the midst of all troubles, you can see
[2:47:16] our peace. And it wasn't by any, it
[2:47:20] wasn't like a spectacular deep call it
[2:47:23] deep service where the church is going,
[2:47:24] "Hey, man. Glory to God." It was a very
[2:47:26] downto-earth service, but it ministered
[2:47:29] so much to me. And the the best way I
[2:47:32] can explain it is that God put before me
[2:47:35] the best peace salesman that there was
[2:47:38] on the face of the earth. Like if you're
[2:47:40] trying to buy peace, he was a guy to
[2:47:41] hear. He preached peace so powerfully
[2:47:44] that the only thing I want is that
[2:47:47] that's what I want. What you're talking
[2:47:49] about, yes, that's what I want. There's
[2:47:51] no doubt in my mind that is what I want.
[2:47:53] He did s the Holy Spirit through him
[2:47:55] just sold peace to me in a way that I
[2:47:58] could not reject it. like there was like
[2:47:59] no way. I was willing to pay whatever
[2:48:01] price it was to get that. So I met him
[2:48:04] at the end of the service and we're in
[2:48:05] his office. We were talking and and just
[2:48:07] told me like I just I just want God
[2:48:08] again. I just want God again in my life.
[2:48:10] And I was emotional and I was praying
[2:48:12] and he says, "Do you want to get
[2:48:14] baptized?" I said, "I was already
[2:48:15] baptized but I would like to get re
[2:48:16] baptized. I would like to start again."
[2:48:18] He says, "Do you want to get baptized
[2:48:19] this Sunday?" I said, "Yes, I would like
[2:48:20] to get baptized this Sunday." And then
[2:48:23] but I said but before I do it brother
[2:48:24] Tom I said how would I know that this
[2:48:27] time like something will sink in for
[2:48:30] good that I'm not going to backslide
[2:48:32] again I'm not going to go back to what I
[2:48:34] used to be this time I want something
[2:48:36] sure so give me an assurance because I
[2:48:38] don't want to do this just for doing it
[2:48:40] again. And he said he took his Bible and
[2:48:44] he said, "What better assurance do you
[2:48:45] need than the word?" And that was it for
[2:48:48] me. Like what how what do you what do
[2:48:50] you say to that? Right? What more
[2:48:52] assurance do you need than the word?
[2:48:54] Then I realized he he's right. There's
[2:48:56] nothing he can give me that's more sure
[2:48:59] than the word of God.
[2:49:00] &gt;&gt; And if if I cannot base my life on what
[2:49:02] the word says, there's nothing that can
[2:49:04] that can be an absolute to me. So I say,
[2:49:06] "All right, I I'll do it." He says,
[2:49:08] "Okay, Sunday morning, wake up a little
[2:49:09] bit earlier than usual. spend some time
[2:49:11] alone with God and then come to church.
[2:49:14] So that Sunday morning, I woke up around
[2:49:16] five o'clock. I spent some time alone
[2:49:18] with God in prayer. I opened my Bible
[2:49:20] and I was reading in Acts chapter 17
[2:49:22] where Paul is talking to the king of
[2:49:23] Gri. He says, "Oh king, I was not
[2:49:25] disobedient to the heavenly vision."
[2:49:27] Right? And I say these words to God in
[2:49:30] prayer. I say, "Lord, all I know is that
[2:49:32] you told me to leave Australia and I
[2:49:34] left and you led me to Canada and I
[2:49:36] came." Oh God, like Paul, I was not
[2:49:40] disobedient to the heavenly vision.
[2:49:42] That's all I said. So, and I know that
[2:49:44] you're leading me in this as I go into
[2:49:45] those waters. I want you to fill me with
[2:49:47] the Holy Spirit. So, I went to church,
[2:49:50] brother Bisco, preach on the the vision
[2:49:52] of the commission. And he's opening the
[2:49:54] scripture. It's Acts 17.
[2:49:58] Oh, Paul, oh king, I live forever. I was
[2:50:00] not disobedient to the heavenly vision.
[2:50:01] Now, God has my attention because I know
[2:50:03] what I was praying about and I know what
[2:50:05] God is doing. Now I said something is
[2:50:07] happening and then I get into the water.
[2:50:10] Brother Tom comes and baptize me and he
[2:50:11] says the scripture that God has placed
[2:50:13] on my heart was the same scripture. Acts
[2:50:15] 17 I was not disobedient to the heavenly
[2:50:17] vision. If God has led you all your life
[2:50:19] he's led you to the waters. He will fill
[2:50:20] with the Holy Spirit. So now I heard
[2:50:22] that scripture twice that day. So he he
[2:50:26] uh prayed for me and he he baptized me
[2:50:29] and I in his prayer he says Lord I
[2:50:31] always remember those words. He says,
[2:50:32] "Lord, like Jeremiah, let there be a
[2:50:35] fire in his bones." And he says, "Lord,
[2:50:37] that fire is so real to me, but let it
[2:50:40] be real to him." And so I appreciate
[2:50:42] those words, you know, somebody who
[2:50:43] knows what he's talking about.
[2:50:46] And then by the grace of God, I went I
[2:50:48] went back on campus and my life just
[2:50:50] changed. It was just it was just day and
[2:50:54] night. I was just a new creatur. I was a
[2:50:56] different man. Anybody who knew me asked
[2:50:58] me what happened to you like you're so
[2:51:00] different. What's going on? People say,
[2:51:02] "I want to go to your church." It's not
[2:51:04] because I was talking to them about
[2:51:06] anything because my life was speaking
[2:51:07] for itself. And they saw that I wasn't a
[2:51:10] Christian like the other Christians. I
[2:51:11] was different. And what it was, I don't
[2:51:14] know. It's just God. God bearing witness
[2:51:16] that there's something different. And
[2:51:18] that's what the world seeing you. They
[2:51:19] might be Christians. They might go to
[2:51:20] church, but they know that there's
[2:51:21] something different about the bride. She
[2:51:23] is different.
[2:51:25] &gt;&gt; And then one by one, they started coming
[2:51:27] on campus and coming to church with me.
[2:51:29] And my my burden My burden was for the
[2:51:33] for the entire all my friends to hear
[2:51:36] this message and it became such a
[2:51:40] growing burden like brother Moses and I
[2:51:42] were talking yesterday these are things
[2:51:43] that you cannot you cannot reproduce
[2:51:45] right like no matter how much I try
[2:51:47] today I can never replicate those things
[2:51:49] it was for a season God did it
[2:51:52] sovereignly I cannot explain the type of
[2:51:55] burden he placed on me it was not my
[2:51:56] doing it wasn't that I was so diligent
[2:51:59] in consecration it wasn't It was just
[2:52:01] that God had placed such a burden on me
[2:52:03] that he weighed on me so much. I
[2:52:06] remember every day I'll come I'll come
[2:52:07] from from class I'll go into the dorms I
[2:52:09] remember I'll throw my bag on the floor
[2:52:11] and get on my knees and start weeping
[2:52:12] and praying. My burn was so great to see
[2:52:16] the word in these people, to see them
[2:52:18] get the word and believe the message.
[2:52:20] And then I started witnessing,
[2:52:21] witnessing, witnessing, witnessing. And
[2:52:23] then the first person that believed and
[2:52:25] got baptized was the catalyst because I
[2:52:27] know if one can believe, two can
[2:52:29] believe, three can believe. And then
[2:52:31] that set me on fire. And then we started
[2:52:33] holding meetings on campus. And some
[2:52:36] young people from the church started
[2:52:37] coming to those meetings on campus. And
[2:52:40] God started saving those in the church
[2:52:42] have a backseat and on campus.
[2:52:44] &gt;&gt; Now you talk about sovereign grace doing
[2:52:46] whatever he wants to do not in church
[2:52:49] but in university. He took churchgoing
[2:52:51] people, brought them to a university and
[2:52:53] saved them there and brought them back
[2:52:55] to church and then that's how the what
[2:52:57] we know as SFA revival be began to
[2:52:59] spread and one by one newcomers got
[2:53:02] saved back came back to God and just
[2:53:04] prayer meetings broke forth in the
[2:53:05] church and there were just special times
[2:53:08] in house till 2 or 3:00 people were
[2:53:10] worshiping and in praying and go back to
[2:53:11] work the next day. You cannot reproduce
[2:53:14] those things anymore. There there was
[2:53:15] just such a a anction in atmosphere
[2:53:18] around that time that we could be in
[2:53:19] prayer for hours and hours. We did not
[2:53:22] want to separate from one another. We
[2:53:23] just want to be together and pray and
[2:53:25] worship. Whenever we got together, we
[2:53:26] broke into prayer and worship. And God
[2:53:29] moved supernaturally every single day.
[2:53:32] Like you you felt like you were walking
[2:53:34] in the Bible. Now I remember one of my
[2:53:37] friends from from SAU uh is Stephen,
[2:53:40] brother Steven Kiri who is now a
[2:53:41] minister. Think about that. We went to
[2:53:43] university together. He came to the
[2:53:45] message. I witnessed to him. He got
[2:53:46] baptized. He went back in Nigeria. I
[2:53:48] became a minister. Started a church. And
[2:53:50] then here I am in Toronto a few months
[2:53:52] ago. And I meet this man. His name is
[2:53:54] brother Mike. He says, "Brother John,
[2:53:56] uh, you don't know me, but I know you."
[2:53:58] He says, "I was brought to the message
[2:53:59] by brother Stephen." I said, "Oh my
[2:54:01] goodness, how amazing this is." You
[2:54:04] never know what God would do, right?
[2:54:06] Somebody gets it and it starts to
[2:54:07] spread. And then so one day him and I
[2:54:10] were walking. I remember we're walking
[2:54:12] to the bus stop together to catch the
[2:54:13] bus and we were singing one of them
[2:54:17] which which I'm going to ask you to sing
[2:54:18] brother. We're singing together one of
[2:54:20] them. I'm so glad that I can say just
[2:54:22] two of us in the street people walking
[2:54:24] past us and we're just singing one of
[2:54:26] them. It felt at that moment it felt
[2:54:29] like there was just a bubble around us.
[2:54:31] It was just you. It was just him and me
[2:54:33] and God. And we were we were in this
[2:54:36] vortex of the presence of God and
[2:54:38] CATCHING THIS REVELATION. OH, I'M SO
[2:54:40] GLAD. I'M ONE OF THEM. I'M ONE OF THE
[2:54:43] FEW THAT GETS TO SEE THIS. IT WAS SUCH A
[2:54:46] JOY. And we were just rejoicing and
[2:54:47] saying, "Oh my goodness, what a joy to
[2:54:50] see this message." And his his life was
[2:54:52] changed. He was he wanted God. And all
[2:54:54] the things he was praying about, he
[2:54:55] found in the message. You know, his joy
[2:54:57] was like, "This is what MY SOUL WAS
[2:54:59] CRYING FOR." AND AND I'M ONE OF THEM.
[2:55:02] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. You know, one of the the
[2:55:04] greatest throw in my heart and I've said
[2:55:06] this multiple times is that I love to
[2:55:08] hear people tell me their testimony and
[2:55:10] how they came in contact with the
[2:55:12] message because every single time I hear
[2:55:14] somebody, it doesn't matter how the
[2:55:15] testimony is, but I hear the same thing
[2:55:17] from everyone. What I hear is that they
[2:55:20] heard what I heard
[2:55:23] &gt;&gt; and it all it so blesses me that there
[2:55:26] are people on the earth that have heard
[2:55:29] what I've heard and we had that in
[2:55:30] common. We were going about life, living
[2:55:32] our own life, doing whatever we wanted.
[2:55:34] But somehow we heard the same thing.
[2:55:37] &gt;&gt; If you're here together this morning,
[2:55:38] it's because you all heard the same
[2:55:41] thing.
[2:55:42] &gt;&gt; And only you have the ability to hear
[2:55:46] those things. Those who have not heard
[2:55:48] them don't have the ability to hear
[2:55:49] them, BUT YOU HEARD IT. SOMEHOW IT SPOKE
[2:55:51] TO YOU AND IT SPOKE TO ME. AND WE HAPPEN
[2:55:54] TO BE HERE TOGETHER because we heard the
[2:55:56] same thing.
[2:55:57] And it always thrills me to say, "Oh,
[2:55:59] God, you're so wonderful." Like, you can
[2:56:01] go to this one, that way, to this one,
[2:56:03] that way. But all of us here still, we
[2:56:04] all heard the call of God.
[2:56:06] &gt;&gt; We heard our mama eagle coming and
[2:56:08] screaming and calling us out and we say,
[2:56:10] "That's me."
[2:56:11] &gt;&gt; Right? So then uh that's when the Holy
[2:56:15] Spirit really began to move in the
[2:56:17] church. And like I said, many people got
[2:56:18] saved there. And then God started a deal
[2:56:21] with me. And brother Tom says, "I think
[2:56:22] God is calling you to preach. Uh I think
[2:56:24] you should preach. This is 2015." I
[2:56:26] said, "Nope, definitely not." In 2016,
[2:56:28] he says, "I think you should preach." I
[2:56:30] said, "Nope, that's definitely not me."
[2:56:32] 2017, "I think God's calling you to
[2:56:33] preach." Nope. That's not my calling.
[2:56:36] 2018, Brother Jean. I was like, "Uh,
[2:56:39] no." So, for about seven years, I I kept
[2:56:42] saying that's I don't think that's what
[2:56:44] God has called me to do. That's that's
[2:56:45] just not who I am. That's just I I can't
[2:56:47] I can't I can't do it. I can't. And like
[2:56:50] I said, by by your fruits, right? That's
[2:56:52] why people recognize by your fruits. You
[2:56:53] don't have to tell people what you are.
[2:56:55] They tell you who you are but the first
[2:56:57] you bear. So one day I was listening to
[2:56:59] a service from brother Donnie Donnie
[2:57:02] Rian u I encourage you to listen to it
[2:57:04] if you want to. It's called the danger
[2:57:06] of an unsurrendered heart. And then he
[2:57:09] took Samson as Samson Samson gave his
[2:57:11] gift and his talent and his strength to
[2:57:12] God, but he gave his heart to a woman,
[2:57:14] right? And his heart was never fully
[2:57:16] surrendered. And I was listening to that
[2:57:18] service. It so convicted me like in in a
[2:57:21] in such a deep way that I can only
[2:57:23] explain. And it left me so confused
[2:57:26] because as far as I knew, I had given my
[2:57:28] heart to God. As far as I know, I had
[2:57:31] surrendered my heart to God. I said,
[2:57:32] "Why am I being convicted by this?" I I
[2:57:35] know I know what conviction is. I know
[2:57:36] the Holy Spirit is putting his finger on
[2:57:38] my heart and say this is you. But why is
[2:57:40] he saying that? Because I've given my
[2:57:42] heart to the Lord. I've been baptized.
[2:57:43] I'm feeling the spirit. I'm serving God.
[2:57:44] Like why am I feeling this? And then I
[2:57:48] was just I was just so disturbed by
[2:57:50] that. But then you know over time that
[2:57:51] feeling went away. And then I heard
[2:57:53] another service and then that same
[2:57:54] feeling came back and then it went away.
[2:57:56] And then one time, this is back in 2021,
[2:57:59] brother Murphy was speaking and on a
[2:58:02] Sunday morning, the Friday night before
[2:58:04] that, I was pondering on this. I said,
[2:58:06] Lord, I don't know why I keep feeling
[2:58:07] this. But clearly, if you're push
[2:58:10] putting your finger on that, it means
[2:58:12] that somehow I'm not as surrendered as I
[2:58:14] think. And I said, but you're going to
[2:58:16] have to show me what that looks like
[2:58:18] because I don't know what else to do. I
[2:58:19] don't know what prayer to pray. I've
[2:58:21] already prayed. Lord, I give you my
[2:58:22] heart. I give you everything. You know,
[2:58:24] I don't know what to do. I really don't
[2:58:26] know what to do. So that morning,
[2:58:28] brother Murphy preached and then he's
[2:58:30] talking about a full surrender. And then
[2:58:32] he makes his altar call and says, I just
[2:58:35] been I've been resisting to make this
[2:58:36] alter call. I wanted to do it last
[2:58:38] Sunday. I didn't. And God rebuked me for
[2:58:39] it. So I'm going to do it today. Those
[2:58:41] who know that you not fully surrender
[2:58:42] your heart to God. You should come to
[2:58:43] the front. And I'm standing there in my
[2:58:45] pew just wrestling with this. Says, I
[2:58:50] know that God is speaking to me, but I
[2:58:52] don't know why. like I don't know if I
[2:58:55] go to the front sure like what is that
[2:58:57] going to do, right? What am I going to
[2:58:59] say that's going to be different than
[2:59:00] what I've already done in the past? I
[2:59:02] don't really know what God wants for me,
[2:59:03] but this is really bothering me. And so
[2:59:06] I'm like, I'm not going to go. So I just
[2:59:08] stayed and I opened my eyes and it was
[2:59:10] packed. The altar was packed really,
[2:59:12] really packed. So I was just I'm just
[2:59:14] going to stay here and just pray. And
[2:59:15] then my wife, she managed me. She says,
[2:59:17] "I would like to come to the front.
[2:59:18] Would you like to come with me?" I was
[2:59:20] like, "Uh, okay. Let's go." So We went I
[2:59:24] went with her and I was just I was in a
[2:59:25] hallway because it was really packed. So
[2:59:27] I was probably somewhere there and I I
[2:59:29] started praying like Lord I don't know
[2:59:32] why I'm standing here. I don't know why
[2:59:33] I'm here but I know you're in this. I
[2:59:35] really don't know what you're calling me
[2:59:37] to here but you keep telling me I'm not
[2:59:39] fully surrendered. As far as I know I
[2:59:40] am. I've done all that I know to do.
[2:59:43] I've surren what part of me do do you
[2:59:45] not have? You can have all of it.
[2:59:47] Everything you want me to be whatever
[2:59:48] you have for me I surrender all to you.
[2:59:51] Right. And then I just prayed that
[2:59:53] prayer and then something just said like
[2:59:55] go see brother Tom. So I opened my eyes
[2:59:58] and he just finished praying with
[3:00:00] somebody and he was getting up. So I
[3:00:01] just tapped on my shoulder and I said,
[3:00:03] "Brother Tom, I want you to pray with
[3:00:04] me." And he turned around and says,
[3:00:05] "What is it?" And I said, "Brother Tom,
[3:00:07] I don't know what this is, but every
[3:00:09] single time I hear this type of a
[3:00:10] sermon, I really get convicted." Then I
[3:00:13] I just broke down. I says, I said, "I
[3:00:15] don't know what it is, but it's just one
[3:00:17] leave me alone. There's something
[3:00:18] something that I'm not done yet." He
[3:00:20] says, Oh, brother Je. Oh, brother Je
[3:00:23] said, "Let's pray." And then he says,
[3:00:25] "Lord, there was once a man called
[3:00:27] Isaiah who heard the voice of God and he
[3:00:30] said, Lord, here I am sending me." I was
[3:00:32] like, "Oh, no. This is what it is." No.
[3:00:37] And it says, "You have been calling
[3:00:39] brother Jean. Now may he say, here I am.
[3:00:42] Send me." Oh my goodness. That's when I
[3:00:46] understood what it was. And that's why I
[3:00:48] surrendered everything to God. And I
[3:00:49] say, "Lord, if this is what you want me
[3:00:50] to do, I will do it. I'm terrified. I
[3:00:53] might fail. I might be I might ruin my
[3:00:56] life because says you will ruin your
[3:00:57] life. If God didn't call you to do it,
[3:00:59] you will." And I'm like, "But if my life
[3:01:02] is going to be ruined for trying to
[3:01:03] trust you, so be it. I'm just going to
[3:01:05] trust you in this." So we finished
[3:01:07] praying. I went back to my seat. The
[3:01:10] church is dismissed. And I'm sitting
[3:01:11] there and something tells me, "You're
[3:01:13] preaching Wednesday." And this is Sunday
[3:01:15] morning, right? Says, "You're preaching
[3:01:16] Wednesday." said, "No, I mean, I just
[3:01:20] surrendered to God." And I'm like, "No,
[3:01:23] this cannot be happening." I grabbed my
[3:01:24] Bible and I left the church so fast. I
[3:01:27] walked so fast. As I was going out, a
[3:01:29] brother tapped me on the back. He says,
[3:01:30] "Brother Tom wants to see you." I was
[3:01:32] like, "Yeah, just that's it." I knew
[3:01:35] exactly what I was going to be. Step in
[3:01:37] his office and he said, "This is the
[3:01:39] time God is calling you. You're gonna
[3:01:41] have to preach on Wednesday." So, we
[3:01:43] went ahead and preached first sermon
[3:01:46] 2021 and Since then, God has been
[3:01:48] faithful to us and we continue to try to
[3:01:51] do something for the bride. And do do we
[3:01:54] make mistakes? Yes. Do we regret this?
[3:01:56] Not a chance. Cannot cannot regret. It's
[3:01:59] a privilege to be a part of what God
[3:02:01] doing is doing in these last days. And I
[3:02:04] have such a great love and respect for
[3:02:05] the bride that whenever I step here, I
[3:02:07] says, "Lord, these are your purchase." I
[3:02:10] don't believe in beating down the bride
[3:02:11] and making her feel worthless and
[3:02:13] useless and that she's not good enough.
[3:02:15] No, I believe I have to tell you how God
[3:02:18] sees you. No matter how you see
[3:02:20] yourself, that's irrelevant. What I want
[3:02:22] you to understand is what God sees you.
[3:02:24] And I always try by the grace of God to
[3:02:26] uplift you with every time I speak that
[3:02:28] you might go home loving God more. And I
[3:02:30] hope that the word did that this
[3:02:31] morning. So in a nutshell, that's that's
[3:02:34] my my my testimony. I hope that was a
[3:02:36] blessing to you as well. Brother Ray,
[3:02:38] why don't we stand? And I just really
[3:02:40] wanted to sing this song. There are
[3:02:42] people almost everywhere whose hearts
