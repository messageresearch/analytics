[33:51] are living according to the spirit. Only
[33:54] God can give the new birth. No one can
[33:57] give the new birth to another person. So
[33:59] you should be thankful when you are born
[34:01] again.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. because God has done that for you
[34:04] and give and he has received your faith
[34:07] and it shows that you are part of him.
[34:09] Praise be to God. Thank you. Let's go to
[34:12] the Lord in prayer this morning. Just
[34:14] want to share need that as a request. So
[34:16] sister
[34:19] just take that need sister
[34:22] Claudia put a prayer request for brother
[34:25] Nicholas Terzaki
[34:29] said
[34:30] the brother he heard the testimony about
[34:33] the sister and uh now he's suffering
[34:36] with a cancer and he want us to pray for
[34:39] him. Just want to remember him in
[34:42] prayer. Now a serious need but there is
[34:44] nothing cancer is nothing in God's God's
[34:48] eyes. There's been this week I think
[34:51] this [music] week or last week I was
[34:52] just thinking of another sister and went
[34:55] to India. We prayed for her. She was a
[34:58] she she was suffering and cancer almost
[35:02] a desperate situation but just came to
[35:05] my mind again to think about her. Lord,
[35:08] [music] would you just just remember and
[35:10] touch her? I don't have a new report. I
[35:13] don't know how it's going, but just to
[35:15] remember. I just went through my mind
[35:18] [music] again. I thought of her. Lord,
[35:19] may just your presence be. And remember,
[35:23] remember brother Dale was like as well.
[35:27] Just God is moving brother Ed and all
[35:31] the situations. [music]

[35:35] situations that

[36:25] Lord as we have sung. You are the king.
[36:28] You are the lord of lord, the king of
[36:30] [music] kings, the prince of peace. You
[36:33] are the healer. You are the redeemer.
[36:34] You are the great shepherd. You are all
[36:37] our [music] life. You are our portion,
[36:40] our satisfying portion. Father, Lord,
[36:43] you are the lamb of God or slain for the
[36:45] sinner's sins. Father, Lord Jesus
[36:48] Christ. And this morning we want to
[36:50] praise your name to glorify your name.
[36:52] Father, Lord Jesus Christ. We want to
[36:55] lift you up. Father, you said when
[36:57] you'll be lifted up, you'll draw men
[36:59] unto you, Father. And Lord, we give you
[37:01] the praise and we put you at the right
[37:03] position and we have the right mental
[37:05] attitude towards any promise of God.
[37:07] You'll make it come to fulfill to be
[37:10] fulfilled. Father, Lord, we are gathered
[37:12] here together, uniting our faith, Lord,
[37:15] for this the needs that has been brought
[37:17] us before before you Lord Jesus Christ.
[37:20] Lord remember our brother here Lord we
[37:23] have to send the request recognizing
[37:25] that there is a living God the God who
[37:28] can heal the God who can change the God
[37:31] who can save you are still the same
[37:33] yesterday today and forever father Lord
[37:36] you said in your word as [music] you
[37:38] told your prophet you have a sincere
[37:40] even cancer cannot resist before you
[37:43] said not fear cancer is only a demon is
[37:46] only a devil but but greater is he that
[37:50] is in you than he that is in the world.
[37:52] Greater is he that is in you than he
[37:54] that than the cancer, Father Lord. So we
[37:56] are calling upon your name this morning,
[37:59] Father, and sending your word to our
[38:01] brother, Lord. Brother Nicholas, may you
[38:03] touch him, Father. May you restore him.
[38:06] May you, Father, Lord Jesus Christ,
[38:07] bring him closer to you. Father, you
[38:10] said you shall pray and the prayer of
[38:11] faith shall save the sick and the Lord
[38:14] shall restore them. If they have
[38:16] committed any sin, Father, shall be
[38:18] forgiven unto them, Father. Be merciful
[38:21] unto him, Lord Jesus Christ, as [music]
[38:23] we commit him to you, Father, and we
[38:25] send your word to him. And we draw,
[38:27] Father, strength from Calvary. May you,
[38:30] Father, come closer to you and draw his
[38:32] strength, Father, from El Shadai as we
[38:34] [music] commit him to you, Lord.
[38:36] Remember the sister, Lord, in India once
[38:38] again. Father, may you touch her. May
[38:40] you restore her, Father. Lord, distance
[38:42] is nothing [music] to you, Father. Lord
[38:45] Jesus Christ, Lord, you are the healer,
[38:48] you are the comforter, you are the
[38:50] restorer of strength. Father, we lift
[38:52] your name high. We thank you this
[38:54] morning because Father, Lord, we are
[38:56] trusting in your word. Your word, heaven
[38:58] and earth will pass away, but your word
[39:00] shall never pass away. Remember, brother
[39:02] Dale Washer, Father, oh God, a man of
[39:05] faith, man who's trusting you, never
[39:08] complains. Father, Lord Jesus Christ,
[39:10] may you touch him. May you restore him.
[39:12] May you father [music] fill him father
[39:14] with your strength over El Shadai. Oh
[39:17] God, you are still Jehovah Rafa, the God
[39:19] we left for all our sicknesses and all
[39:21] our diseases. Lord, if you heal
[39:23] yesterday, you can heal again today.
[39:25] Lord Jesus Christ, we commit ourselves
[39:27] to you. Remember brother Ed, Lord, may
[39:30] you touch him. May we restore him,
[39:32] Father. Oh God, you are still the same
[39:34] God. One more time, Lord. Lord, we
[39:37] commit him to you. We commit brother Ron
[39:39] Spencer to you, Father. Lord, you break
[39:41] the chains of the enemy. Satan is only a
[39:44] blast. Father, the victory has been
[39:46] already won on Calvary. By your stripes,
[39:48] we are already healed. You said healing,
[39:51] Father, is the bread of the children. We
[39:53] are your children this morning. And we
[39:55] are claiming the promise of Golgota.
[39:58] Thank you once again, Father. Remember
[40:00] brother Ray and his family, the Adrian
[40:02] family, Lord. God, for this sad news
[40:05] that father came, but Lord Jesus, you
[40:08] had a comforter. Nothing, Lord, is hard
[40:10] to you. And you know why it happened,
[40:12] Lord. You allowed it to happen. No
[40:15] father. May you rub your arms of love
[40:18] towards the family and comfort them Lord
[40:20] in this time. Lord we love you and
[40:22] appreciate [music] you. Remember us this
[40:24] morning. Remember the churches that that
[40:26] are gathered around the country, around
[40:28] the continent, Father, in this on today.
[40:31] Remember them, Father. We love you and
[40:34] appreciate you. In Jesus Christ's name
[40:35] we pray. Amen. Amen.
[40:40] Amen.
[40:44] Amen.
[40:47] Continue to pray for one another. We're
[40:49] living in a
[40:51] tremendous time. Just want to encourage
[40:55] us to pray for one another. Amen.
[40:59] Let's go to the Lord and to the reading
[41:02] of the word of God. Thank you musicians.
[41:06] As has been announced,
[41:09] many are traveling
[41:11] and um
[41:14] just want to keep praying for them.
[41:21] But the victor sent me a message this
[41:22] morning. He had some mechanical problem
[41:25] with his car and don't know if they
[41:28] managed to come but
[41:30] just want to
[41:33] pray for them as well whether they're
[41:35] streaming or maybe they're on the roads
[41:37] but just want to remember them as well.
[41:46] I hope you had a little bit of time with
[41:48] friends and family during the this week
[41:51] and uh continue again this week. that we
[41:54] have a gathering on the Wednesday,
[41:57] December
[41:59] the 31st at 6
[42:03] and 6 sharp and 6:30 we start eating for
[42:08] those not heating eating
[42:11] start eating at 6:30 shop for the for
[42:15] the supper and then we have a quite a
[42:17] long night program for that night but
[42:21] 6:30 and then maybe 8:30 or 9:00 we
[42:25] might finish over there but we start
[42:27] around 9 and then those who can leave
[42:30] early we can leave a little bit early
[42:32] but those who want to stay and pray over
[42:35] over until good new year be welcome
[42:38] there'll be there'll be quite um
[42:42] planning some some some some time in the
[42:45] presence of the Lord just um singing and
[42:49] praising and praying and giving
[42:51] testimony with a word of exhortation but
[42:55] it won't be too much preaching but just
[42:57] encouragement for one another until the
[43:00] new year and uh so 6:30 if possible to
[43:04] be there to be not African time not not
[43:08] Indian time not South American time
[43:11] German time
[43:14] 6:30 German time so be there um I think
[43:19] that's all the I've had also
[43:21] announcement so We suggested to the to
[43:24] the church helpers to to to remember
[43:27] brother Phillip. Um brother Philillip is
[43:29] traveling to Portugal and suggesting to
[43:32] him if he can help us with with the
[43:36] office of a of a deacon and working
[43:38] together with Papa Matendo and um I
[43:42] reached out to him and he he mentioned
[43:44] that um God's grace I think he will take
[43:48] that and just keep him in prayer. So um
[43:51] I told him that I announce to the church
[43:53] and his absence. Um
[43:56] even if he was here I will announce it
[43:58] too but it turns out that he's absent.
[44:00] So just ask him permission to announce
[44:03] it even during his absence. So just keep
[44:06] that in prayer. So as the prophet has
[44:08] recommended us we will be doing that for
[44:11] for one year and how himself feels
[44:14] comfortable in that then we'll pray the
[44:18] other year if the lord terries for
[44:21] confirmation for that office. So just
[44:24] keep that in prayer and if anything just
[44:27] bring it up to our attention then we
[44:30] just pray about it. Amen.
[44:33] But uh he's a is a solid brother and a
[44:36] sister, his wife, solid sister and I've
[44:40] known them for for a couple of years now
[44:42] and
[44:43] a time of fellowship and everything. I
[44:45] know his attitude is always loving the
[44:49] message and encouraging people and all
[44:52] that and I believe that is going to be a
[44:54] blessing for this church and still
[44:57] looking for for a trustee and then also
[44:59] for a treasurer and a couple of brothers
[45:03] in mind just to reach out to them again
[45:06] during this week. Maybe we have
[45:08] confirmation on next next week, God
[45:11] willing. Um, beside that, we thank God
[45:14] for each and everyone.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; May God bless you all and we appreciate
[45:18] you all and I just thank you again for
[45:21] your your faithfulness and just loving
[45:23] the Lord and serving him. Amen. James
[45:27] chapter
[45:29] 4 and uh verse 8.
[45:32] This is the last service of the No, not
[45:36] the last service of the year but
[45:39] last Sunday of the year.
[45:42] Yes. So last Sunday of the year. So it's
[45:46] my honor and privilege to speak to you.
[45:49] But I felt drawn as last Sunday. A
[45:52] little bit of a little bit of a bridge
[45:55] was open last last Sunday. And I feel
[45:58] like I can continue the same line a
[46:00] little bit on there. And I just felt
[46:02] like I could speak on that and should
[46:06] just bear with me on this thought for a
[46:08] moment. But the Lord is in control.
[46:11] Amen. John James 4 verse
[46:16] 8.
[46:18] We can even start from verse 7 and then
[46:29] start from verse six.
[46:32] But he give us more grace. Wherefore he
[46:35] said, God resisteth the proud, but
[46:38] giveth grace unto the humble. Submit
[46:42] yourselves therefore to God. Resist the
[46:45] devil and he will flee from you.
[46:48] Draw nigh to God and he will draw nigh
[46:51] to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners
[46:55] and purify your hearts, ye doubleminded.
[47:00] May God bless his word. You can have a
[47:02] seat. And uh
[47:10] just want to bow our heads one more time
[47:13] as we just approach this word of God.
[47:16] Father we thank you once again. Father
[47:18] we just open the word of God as we have
[47:21] mentioned maybe for the last Sunday of
[47:24] the year. God we thank you for your
[47:27] grace in our life for the whole year.
[47:30] how you kept us, how you watched over
[47:32] us, Father. Lord, how you have blessed
[47:34] us with tremendous spiritual food in due
[47:37] season through many ministers. Father,
[47:40] many visitors who visited us, Lord, who
[47:44] spoke the word of truth and encouraged
[47:46] us and helped us, edified our our soul
[47:49] and helped our faith, Father. We thank
[47:52] you, Father, for that. We thank you for
[47:54] the local ministers. Thank for pastor
[47:57] Zigg Lord for the word of encouragement,
[48:00] little of exhortation. Thank you for
[48:02] pastor for for brother Victor Lord for
[48:05] the word and the preaching and the
[48:07] encouragement, the inspiration that you
[48:09] gave him. Father, we thank you for that
[48:11] Lord. We love you and appreciate you
[48:13] Lord. Sometimes in the special special
[48:17] meetings for the special needs and the
[48:19] prayer papender will take a thought and
[48:23] we share it father lord and encourage us
[48:25] father we thank you for that. Thank you
[48:27] father for brother God for brother goian
[48:30] for the youth meeting and as you you
[48:34] will inspire him father will speak and
[48:36] encourage us in our walk father we want
[48:40] want to say thank you father for all the
[48:41] gift and for all you are putting in the
[48:44] church in the body of Christ and we
[48:46] thank you thank you for the tape
[48:48] sometimes God the brother that brother
[48:51] Andrew would put at the beginning of the
[48:53] service and create the atmosphere and
[48:55] help us father lord We thank you,
[48:57] Father, for all that. And thank you for
[48:59] one another, for the body of Christ. We
[49:02] love you and appreciate you, Lord Jesus
[49:04] Christ. We just want to say thank you
[49:06] for this year. Thank you for how God,
[49:09] you have healed us from sicknesses and
[49:11] diseases. You have helped us, Lord, to
[49:14] stand. We failed many times, but you
[49:16] helped us, Lord, to stand and to keep
[49:18] moving. It's your grace, Father. You
[49:21] have given us grace, and we want to say
[49:23] thank you. Help us, Father, to continue
[49:25] forward. Blessed the bride this morning,
[49:28] Father, the heads of home, the mothers
[49:30] and the sisters and the brothers and the
[49:33] young one, Father. May you bless each
[49:35] and everyone. We love you, Lord. Give
[49:37] you the glory and the honor as we commit
[49:40] ourselves to you in Jesus Christ. And we
[49:41] pray. Amen.
[49:48] I would like to talk to take a thought
[49:50] from uh
[49:53] verse 8 as I mentioned draw nigh to God
[49:56] and he will draw nigh unto you.
[50:00] It's um it's a it's a principle that I
[50:03] just want to build a little bit on that
[50:05] just to show um I want not hoping not to
[50:09] be too long but um just want to put that
[50:13] as a final thought maybe a thought that
[50:15] you can also carry in the new year
[50:19] there's a thing God God as a principle
[50:21] is if you draw nigh to him he will draw
[50:24] nigh unto you and he has blessed us many
[50:27] times and as I mentioned this year. But
[50:31] the new year, God wants to bless us
[50:33] more. And the key to that is if you draw
[50:36] nigh to him, he will draw nigh to you
[50:38] will bless you more. And as you draw
[50:40] nigh to him, God always draw God blesses
[50:44] the one who seeks him, the one who looks
[50:47] for him, God is going to bless him.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I don't feel like I should go
[50:53] back and but I still I still spend time
[50:56] a little bit on that. It's always
[50:57] sometimes hard to go and talk a little
[51:00] bit on the on the way of the things that
[51:02] we have to do because it looks like we
[51:05] are going back again to the the works.
[51:08] We want to promote works um above above
[51:12] the faith or above our relationship or
[51:14] above love and no thanks. It doesn't
[51:16] look like that. But sometimes in our
[51:19] mind on our attitude we again what can I
[51:23] do? I kind of can never satisfy God by
[51:25] what I'm doing. and and we also feel um
[51:30] feel low, feel feel empty, we feel
[51:32] unsufficient and myself included, amen,
[51:36] all of us and we we can never satisfy
[51:38] God with our works and so it's always a
[51:40] little bit hard to go on that and I
[51:42] believe especially for the mature
[51:44] Christians but still the word of God and
[51:47] we have we have touched in many times
[51:49] and see oh grace and grace and works and
[51:53] faith and works and all that And
[51:56] especially we go back and then sometimes
[51:59] looks like contradictory and we go back
[52:01] and forth and and uh and it's it's still
[52:05] it's still a fight for the every
[52:06] minister sometimes to go back and forth
[52:08] and explain that. So this morning I just
[52:11] want want to say that um it's not maybe
[52:13] my focus this morning but still I'll
[52:16] touch on it just to put as a as a as a
[52:19] foundation. The fact that you are here
[52:21] is because God drew nigh unto you first.
[52:25] You were not looking for God. I was not
[52:28] looking for God. Is God was looking for
[52:30] you. It's God who called you. God who
[52:34] touched your heart. The prophet says it
[52:37] Adam was not looking for God. It's God
[52:39] was looking for Adam. It's always that
[52:42] way because man was running away from
[52:44] God. And our attitude is running away
[52:47] from God. And you feel feel guilty, you
[52:49] run away from God. It's always the natur
[52:52] natural attitude of a human being. But
[52:55] you know, but God if God put something
[52:57] inside of you, God has a way to draw you
[53:00] back to you, back to himself. He has a
[53:03] way, you know, it can be different way.
[53:05] It can be for advice. It can be through
[53:07] dreams. It can be through the word the
[53:09] word of God in the church. Can be
[53:10] through a paper, different way. But God
[53:12] has a way to draw you back. And he will
[53:15] because he can't lose you. If he's part
[53:17] of God, he can never never never lose
[53:19] you. Amen. So this God who's calling we
[53:22] we not call ourselves. So our calling is
[53:24] justification is what God has done.
[53:27] Amen. But remember as well as we go to
[53:31] our calling and justification is not the
[53:33] end of his purpose. God didn't just call
[53:36] you and justify you from all the sins
[53:38] and of past and say okay that's done. My
[53:40] work is done for you. No, God calls us
[53:43] because he has something he want to
[53:45] express through us. God called you. God
[53:48] called me because he want to express
[53:50] himself through you and through me. The
[53:53] purpose of God, he want to work through
[53:55] man. He want to work through human
[53:57] beings. He was not happy when he was
[53:59] just under on the dispensation of a
[54:02] father. That was not in good enough for
[54:05] him. It was good but that was not good
[54:07] enough. It was not even good enough as
[54:09] he went in the dispensation of a son
[54:11] sunship that was wonderful through him
[54:14] we have salvation but that was not good
[54:17] enough for God. God wants the third per
[54:20] the purpose of God a part of thought the
[54:23] third dispensation is God want to work
[54:26] through man. He want to work through me.
[54:28] He want to work through you. That's the
[54:30] goal of God. That's the last
[54:32] dispensation until we go in the rapture.
[54:35] God want to use you through the Holy
[54:37] Spirit. That's why I thank God what the
[54:40] God gave as as brother brother Victor.
[54:42] The inspiration is the the new birth is
[54:45] a must. The new birth is a must. That's
[54:46] what we study about the foundation is
[54:48] the new birth. Foundation is the new you
[54:51] must be born again. You must be filled
[54:54] with the Holy Spirit. But as you are
[54:56] filled with the Holy Spirit is the
[54:57] literal life of Jesus Christ. And God
[55:00] wants that life to be expressed
[55:03] people. And that life has to be
[55:04] expressed and we call it the literal
[55:06] life of Jesus Christ. Sometimes we call
[55:08] it the works of the Holy Spirit.
[55:10] Sometimes we call it perfection as well.
[55:13] Now perfection as you have received the
[55:15] Holy Ghost you have to grow until you
[55:18] come to the full maturity or you come to
[55:20] the full perfection. The prophet says in
[55:23] the token it says but in this glorious
[55:24] place under this covenant there is a
[55:27] difference between the blood and the
[55:29] life. The token for the believer today
[55:31] is the Holy Ghost. Not a blood, not a
[55:33] chemistry, but it is the Holy Spirit of
[55:36] God. It is the token that God requires
[55:39] of the church today. God must see the
[55:42] token. He must see it in every one of
[55:45] us. God is requiring a token. Without
[55:48] the token, you can't [snorts] have
[55:50] eternal life. Without the token, it's
[55:52] only judgment. So God is requiring the
[55:54] token. Is requiring the new birth.
[55:56] That's what he call the token. So
[55:58] therefore, the evening shadows as
[56:00] appearances, the wrath is ready to be
[56:03] poured out from on high upon the ungodly
[56:05] nations, upon the ungodly unbelievers,
[56:08] upon the professors without a
[56:10] possession, upon these things I've tried
[56:13] to unfold myself and leave right right
[56:16] among it to see where it was unsettling.
[56:18] Then he goes a little bit down there and
[56:20] just keeps on part. He says the animal
[56:22] life could not return back. Therefore, a
[56:25] blood had to be placed on the door, upon
[56:27] the lintils and upon the post of the
[56:29] door that every by pastor, the whole
[56:32] public, everybody coming by the house
[56:35] knew that there was a sign on that door,
[56:37] a blood that a life had died on that
[56:40] door. So as in the natural the light
[56:42] life of the animal when was that the
[56:45] animal was killed the blood was was
[56:47] spilled the blood was shed and that
[56:50] blood was a sign that was there was a
[56:52] life that is replacing the life of the
[56:54] unbelief of the believers right it is
[56:57] replacing the life of the believers and
[56:59] that life and that blood has to be put
[57:01] on the lentil it has to be public it has
[57:04] to be displayed it has to be visible
[57:07] amen so if we put in in a spiritual
[57:10] realm now no on our side as well. The
[57:12] life of Jesus Christ has to be visible.
[57:15] The life of Jesus Christ has to be
[57:17] public. People have to see that life as
[57:20] oh really that's the life of Jesus
[57:22] Christ. You can't live a hidden
[57:25] Christian life. It's impossible. That a
[57:28] hidden Christian life is not is not the
[57:30] fullness of the purpose of God. It has
[57:32] to be displayed. You can't be honest.
[57:34] I'm a believer in the heart. God just
[57:36] sees my heart. God looks on the heart.
[57:39] No. No. No. Yes, it looks on the heart
[57:42] but that what is the heart has to be
[57:44] manifest in the visible. Amen. Do you
[57:45] agree? It has to be manifest. If if it's
[57:48] not manifest in the visible then it's
[57:52] not to prove to any man but it's just
[57:53] yourself not God. What the life is
[57:55] inside has to become manifested
[57:57] otherwise something is wrong otherwise
[57:59] the token is not displayed. It has to be
[58:02] public and the prophet says that's the
[58:04] way it has to be with every believer
[58:06] today filled with the Holy Ghost. a
[58:08] token that shed the blood of the lamb.
[58:10] The that life that was in the lamb has
[58:12] returned back and is publicly sealed in
[58:14] there. That everybody passing by talking
[58:17] to you has an associate with you. Seeing
[58:20] that the blood has been applied that the
[58:22] token of life that was in that blood is
[58:24] upon you. You are safe from wrath that
[58:27] alone not membership. No sir. Amen. So
[58:30] the token has to be public. And then
[58:33] James here takes in chapter 29 says says
[58:36] and go further. I like I like James
[58:38] because is is one who has the anointing
[58:42] to be back on earth. Right? He didn't
[58:44] have only a legal anointing but also a
[58:48] a cow anointing or ox anointing. He was
[58:51] down on earth right looking and what the
[58:54] needs the the natural needs and looking
[58:57] at the natural say. know you can't just
[58:58] say you can't just say you can't say
[59:00] just say oh I have faith but it doesn't
[59:02] manifest in the works it has to be
[59:04] manifest in the works and James 2:19
[59:06] says thou believeth that there is one
[59:08] God that thouast well the devil also
[59:11] believe and tremble so [snorts] they
[59:13] make putting a point you can't just say
[59:15] no I believe that's oh no you know God
[59:17] just look at my heart I believe I may
[59:19] believe all the message and then say oh
[59:21] yeah oh yeah believe all the word I
[59:24] believe all the Bible I believe all the
[59:25] message yes but if I deliver the
[59:27] message, it has to be displayed. And
[59:30] because the devil also believes, you
[59:32] know, the devil is a great believer of
[59:34] the message.
[59:36] He's a great believer of the message. He
[59:39] knows who Jesus Christ is. He identify
[59:42] Jesus Christ. The Pharisees could not
[59:44] identify Jesus Christ. The devil could
[59:46] identify Jesus Christ. SO, WHO ARE YOU
[59:49] son of one son, SON OF GOD? WHY ARE YOU
[59:51] coming to torment me? He he knew. He
[59:53] believed. He knew. He identified him.
[59:56] But the difference between that is what
[59:58] he believed. He could not apply it. The
[1:00:01] only thing that could apply was the Holy
[1:00:03] Spirit applying his own word in the life
[1:00:05] of the believer. And the devil knows
[1:00:07] brother Banam. He knew brother Banam.
[1:00:09] You listen to the tapes. Every time that
[1:00:11] brother Banham says upon the commission
[1:00:13] that you have given me upon the
[1:00:15] commission of the angel, I rebuke this
[1:00:17] enemy. He has to come out. And every
[1:00:20] child who has crossed eyes always get
[1:00:23] healed
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; because he recognized he recognized the
[1:00:28] commission that was given to the
[1:00:29] prophet. It always came come to pass.
[1:00:32] How come? The devil knew it. He
[1:00:34] identified it. The devil knows you. The
[1:00:37] heavenly identifies you. He knows that
[1:00:39] you're a son of daughter of God. He
[1:00:41] knows it. Amen. So the devil can believe
[1:00:44] but he trumbles. The only difference is
[1:00:46] when it is the life that can be
[1:00:48] manifested, he can't manifest that. So
[1:00:50] James is constructed me or simple
[1:00:53] intellectual belief with living faith.
[1:00:56] The life, the faith, the true faith, the
[1:00:59] genuine faith has to grow and be
[1:01:01] manifested. The genuine faith, the
[1:01:03] genuine new baptism has to become
[1:01:06] manifested through action, true works.
[1:01:08] So is he arguing that the true faith
[1:01:10] produces works, not just the theology?
[1:01:14] We know what the prophet has talked
[1:01:15] about Romans 4 and James 4. Then he
[1:01:17] says, "No, no, God sees at the God sees
[1:01:20] in the heart when there is
[1:01:22] justification." But James was looking at
[1:01:25] what men look at. Amen. But in terms of
[1:01:27] adoption, I'll say this in terms of
[1:01:30] adoption,
[1:01:32] in terms of the adoption, in order to be
[1:01:34] adopted, the capstone I call it the
[1:01:36] adoption. In order to be adopted, God
[1:01:40] and man are looking at the same thing.
[1:01:43] God is looking at you are born again at
[1:01:45] the foundation of faith because faith
[1:01:47] real a new birth is a personal
[1:01:48] revelation to you is a faith to you but
[1:01:51] in order to come to the capstone God is
[1:01:53] looking at works he's looking at what
[1:01:55] the faith has to produce in the life of
[1:01:58] a being so all of that come together so
[1:02:01] man look at what you are living and God
[1:02:03] looking also at what you are living God
[1:02:05] cannot give you the key of his human is
[1:02:08] speaking he cannot give you the key of
[1:02:11] the of the or to you if he if he can't
[1:02:15] trust you, if your behavior is not
[1:02:18] correct, if you're not driving properly
[1:02:20] that oh I'm just a son of God, I can't
[1:02:22] take the key. No, no, no, no, no. Before
[1:02:24] he gives you the key, he has to trust
[1:02:27] you. Your behavior has to concord or to
[1:02:30] associate with what the word of God
[1:02:32] says. Amen. Do you agree with me?
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:36] So in order for the adoption both God
[1:02:40] and man are looking at the same thing.
[1:02:42] Your son is praising you. The prophet
[1:02:45] we're talking if you look at the series
[1:02:46] of adoption says the Holy Spirit give a
[1:02:49] report to the father. Look at the how
[1:02:51] your son is behaving like you. He's
[1:02:53] praising like you. He's taking care of
[1:02:55] your business like you will do yourself.
[1:02:58] So he's look at the way he's dedicating.
[1:03:00] So you look at the place or look at the
[1:03:02] different things to show that it has an
[1:03:05] importance. James 2:22 as James continu
[1:03:07] say see that your faith wrought with his
[1:03:10] works and by works and by works was
[1:03:13] faith made perfect. I want us to to to
[1:03:16] to stay a little bit on the word perfect
[1:03:19] here. And then it says the scripture was
[1:03:21] fulfilled which said Abraham believed
[1:03:22] God and it was imputed unto him for
[1:03:24] righteousness and he was called the
[1:03:26] friend of God. You see then how that by
[1:03:28] works a man is justified, not by faith
[1:03:31] only. Likewise also not Herab the
[1:03:33] hallowed justified by works as she had
[1:03:36] received the messenger and had sent them
[1:03:38] out another way. For as the as the body
[1:03:41] without the spirit is dead, so faith
[1:03:43] without works is dead. Also when John
[1:03:46] when when James is mentioning that faith
[1:03:49] faith here wrote of his works, he's not
[1:03:52] saying that faith is useless. I don't
[1:03:54] think that what he's saying. I not
[1:03:56] saying that faith is useless and say
[1:03:58] faith is important faith is good faith
[1:04:01] that the starting point but that faith
[1:04:03] has to ro has to wrote with his works
[1:04:07] the word wrote in in Greeks is saying is
[1:04:11] actually saying is something that has to
[1:04:14] be that has to work together
[1:04:18] that that word that word wrought it
[1:04:20] means in English that has been
[1:04:21] translated in king James says is to work
[1:04:24] together is to help weave with or works
[1:04:26] together to work together to help in
[1:04:28] work to be partner in labor to put forth
[1:04:31] power together weave and thereby to
[1:04:34] assist. So faith and works has to work
[1:04:36] together. You can't just have faith
[1:04:38] without works. They have to work
[1:04:40] together. That faith has to work
[1:04:42] together with the works. Then it's
[1:04:44] coming to the completion. That works is
[1:04:47] made works was faith made perfect. In
[1:04:50] other words, faith is the starting point
[1:04:53] but it has to come to perfection. THAT
[1:04:56] FAITH TO come to perfect doesn't mean
[1:04:58] that that perfection word in the in the
[1:05:00] Greek word there it means it had to come
[1:05:02] to the fullness. You have to come to the
[1:05:04] maturity. The faith that is coming to
[1:05:07] the maturity is the faith that is
[1:05:10] obedient. Is the faith that has works is
[1:05:12] the faith that is obeying the word of
[1:05:14] God and putting the WORD OF GOD INTO
[1:05:17] ACTION. [clears throat] I believe I
[1:05:19] accept THE WORD OF GOD. [screaming] NOW
[1:05:21] I APPLY THE WORD OF GOD. YOU CAN'T JUST
[1:05:24] BELIEVE AND DON'T APPLY. YES. Then you
[1:05:27] you you believe which is VERY GOOD.
[1:05:30] THAT'S THE STARTING POINT. But you HAVE
[1:05:32] TO COME TO APPLY the word of God. AS YOU
[1:05:34] APPLY the word of God and God trust you
[1:05:37] and says, "Oh, now this is look how my
[1:05:39] son is doing. Look how my son is taking
[1:05:41] me at my word. He's putting my WORD IN
[1:05:43] ACTION." THEN YOU ARE BECOMING MATURE.
[1:05:46] AMEN. YOUR FAITH is becoming mature.
[1:05:48] Your f your faith IS BECOMING PERFECT.
[1:05:52] THINK about Drea. Reab was a believer.
[1:05:54] She believed the word of God. She's
[1:05:56] giving testimonies. We believe that God
[1:05:59] delivered you from Egypt. We believe
[1:06:01] that God was working with you. NOW EVEN
[1:06:03] GOD is going to give you THIS CITY
[1:06:05] JERICHO. GOD is going to give you
[1:06:08] EVERYBODY IS FEARING. GOD IS going to
[1:06:10] give you. SHE'S BELIEVER. SHE'S a
[1:06:12] believer. AND IN THE TIME of needs when
[1:06:15] the spies need to be hidden, then she
[1:06:17] went into action. IF SHE STAYED only by
[1:06:20] her testimony, IT WAS GOOD. But it WAS
[1:06:22] NOT GOOD ENOUGH. IT HAD TO COME INTO
[1:06:25] ACTION when she's hiding the spies.
[1:06:27] She's defending the spies. And then she
[1:06:30] can ask her ask them give me a true
[1:06:33] token. Give me an evidence because I
[1:06:36] have applied the word of God. I have
[1:06:38] believed and look at what I've done.
[1:06:40] I've put my faith into action to the
[1:06:42] point of RISKING MY OWN LIFE BECAUSE I
[1:06:46] BELIEVE SO MUCH THAT GOD IS WITH YOU.
[1:06:48] NOW THE SAME GOD IS WITH YOU. THAT SAME
[1:06:51] GOD can deliver me if you give me the
[1:06:53] true token. Amen.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:57] So I'm not trying to be legalistic. I'm
[1:06:59] just trying to put that point here
[1:07:01] together. Amen. And it's because it can
[1:07:04] be always sometimes a battle. Maybe it's
[1:07:06] not a battle for you, but sometimes a
[1:07:07] battle for the preacher.
[1:07:09] Amen. So perfect does not mean brought
[1:07:12] perfect does not mean that flawless, but
[1:07:14] perfect means brought to maturity or
[1:07:17] fullness like a seed growing into a
[1:07:19] tree. So perfect when the faith comes to
[1:07:22] perfection. In other words, God sees the
[1:07:25] faith comes to be expressed in works.
[1:07:27] Then God says, "My faith has brought to
[1:07:30] the end what I intended to do." When
[1:07:33] Abraham had the faith and James raised
[1:07:36] up, Abraham had the faith, but God had
[1:07:38] to ask him, Abraham, take your son, thy
[1:07:41] only son, and go and sacrificed him. And
[1:07:43] Abraham believed God that God could
[1:07:45] raise him up. And Abraham took the SON
[1:07:48] WITHOUT ANY DOUBT AND BROUGHT THE SON.
[1:07:50] THEN GOD SAID, "NOW ABRAHAM, I know that
[1:07:55] you believe."
[1:07:58] BUT GOD IS THE GOD WHO GAVE HIM THE
[1:08:00] FAITH. HE COULDN'T KNOW THAT he already
[1:08:02] believed. He knew that he believe. He
[1:08:04] knew that he had that faith. But now
[1:08:06] when it was put into action, THEN GOD
[1:08:08] HIMSELF TESTIFIES about it. Abraham, now
[1:08:12] I know that you believe and you love me
[1:08:15] beyond your own son. because of that I'm
[1:08:18] going to bless not only you but I will
[1:08:20] also bless your seed. Praise be to God.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; So the prophet says in the same in the
[1:08:26] same message of the token says now watch
[1:08:29] full now now full now watch full now now
[1:08:33] fully obedience. I'm going just repeat
[1:08:35] what the prophet says. Now watch fully
[1:08:38] now fully obedience to the whole word of
[1:08:40] God entitles us to the token. Lord I
[1:08:44] desire the Holy Ghost. I desire the Holy
[1:08:46] Ghost. God gives US A KEY. THANK GOD FOR
[1:08:48] THAT KEY. Many people don't have that
[1:08:50] key. WE THANK GOD FOR HAVING THAT KEY.
[1:08:53] Full obedience to the word of God
[1:08:55] entitles you to the token. If you're
[1:08:58] obedient to the WORD OF GOD, [screaming]
[1:09:00] GOD IS OBLIGED TO give you the token.
[1:09:03] Amen. [clears throat] Because that IS
[1:09:05] OWN WORD. SO THAT IS JUST A GOD. I just
[1:09:07] want to obey your word. I want to
[1:09:09] fulfill your word. You will fill me with
[1:09:11] the Holy Ghost. So then when we pray
[1:09:13] when we pray and then when we pray we
[1:09:16] must have the token to present with our
[1:09:18] prayer. If you say I pray Lord but
[1:09:20] really I haven't well you don't just
[1:09:22] much as a well stop say go go go first
[1:09:26] and get the token. See because the token
[1:09:28] is what he will recognize. Yes sir. When
[1:09:32] we pray then we must present the token.
[1:09:35] Lord I have obeyed you fully. [snorts]
[1:09:38] Amen. Amen.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Lord, I have obeyed you fully. You can't
[1:09:43] THEN THEN THEN GOD when we are
[1:09:45] presenting the token, you can't just say
[1:09:46] God, I present to you the token, but my
[1:09:49] my my I'm I'm not obeying your word. I'm
[1:09:52] leaving your word aside, but I'm
[1:09:53] presenting to you the token. No, it
[1:09:55] doesn't work that way. Says, "No, Lord,
[1:09:58] I'm presenting you the token. I have
[1:10:00] obeyed your word fully."
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Then God is obliged to his own word.
[1:10:09] I have repented of my sins. I feel that
[1:10:12] you have forgiven me. I I have been
[1:10:14] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:10:17] The Holy Spirit is upon me now. I have
[1:10:20] need of certain things for your glory.
[1:10:22] Lord, I ask for it. It's mine now. Then
[1:10:24] there is something anchors back there
[1:10:26] few and says it is yours. It's over.
[1:10:29] Then it's all over. It's all over. It's
[1:10:31] settled. I ask for the ask for it. I
[1:10:33] must have it. Oh, the strong language of
[1:10:37] the prophet using. I must have it. See,
[1:10:39] I want it for your glory. And see that
[1:10:42] it when he just give it to you now, you
[1:10:44] know it's yours. That's the way it is,
[1:10:46] children. So forth, we apply the blood,
[1:10:49] believe it. And what does it do that
[1:10:51] when you have can present the token with
[1:10:53] your prayer shows that you have fully
[1:10:55] come to the obedience to the whole word
[1:10:57] of God. When you've got the token, it
[1:10:59] shows that you have obeyed every word.
[1:11:02] Amen. Then you and the word are one.
[1:11:05] You're only asking for the thing that
[1:11:06] you are because you are asking for the
[1:11:10] thing that you are because you have
[1:11:11] obeyed the word of God. It says NOW ONE
[1:11:13] YOU KNOW IF I SAY UNTO you hand you obey
[1:11:16] me reach out for that hand coach if it
[1:11:18] does it. See the hand obeyed me. Why?
[1:11:21] It's part of me. When you you and the
[1:11:23] word becomes one every promise glory to
[1:11:26] God every promise is yours. It obeys
[1:11:28] you. Amen. Because you are part of the
[1:11:31] word of God. Then you want I think
[1:11:33] brother brother Victor touched it and
[1:11:34] then he put it so well. Then it obeys
[1:11:37] you then you want to watch what you want
[1:11:40] to do. You wouldn't put your hand in a
[1:11:42] fire just to say see me do it. No no no
[1:11:44] no no. Then there is something in that
[1:11:47] fire. I got to reach it. It will obey
[1:11:49] me. Amen. That's right. You want to
[1:11:51] watch what you are doing. That's the
[1:11:53] season the Holy Spirit sparingly give
[1:11:56] out and things and you know what I mean
[1:11:58] because you don't want to a real servant
[1:12:00] of God don't show off with it. You see
[1:12:03] the that's making a show when we pray we
[1:12:05] present the token. It shows we have
[1:12:08] fully obeyed the word of God.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; And that's my my that's my burden. It's
[1:12:13] my burden for myself. And actually I'm
[1:12:15] I'm kind of preaching to myself this
[1:12:17] morning. Lord, for this new year, I just
[1:12:20] want to draw nigh to you more than it
[1:12:23] has been last year. I just want to obey
[1:12:25] you more than I have done last year. I
[1:12:28] just want to give myself more than I
[1:12:30] have done last year. I don't want to
[1:12:32] stop. I don't I don't I I don't want to
[1:12:34] to to put a corner and say this is my
[1:12:36] this my area. I'm not moving. I'm not
[1:12:38] making anything. No Lord help. I want to
[1:12:40] go more because there's still more I can
[1:12:42] take from you. There's still more I can
[1:12:44] give to you also.
[1:12:48] So the prophet says don't just come thus
[1:12:50] far and say it's the same message
[1:12:52] talking. Don't just come thus far and
[1:12:54] say I believe the message. No, you obey
[1:12:57] the messenger. COME INTO CHRIST. You
[1:12:59] say, "Well, I believe every word said,
[1:13:01] brother Bam, they said that's good. But
[1:13:03] that just just being able to read, take
[1:13:06] the message, TAKE IT INTO YOUR HEART
[1:13:09] THAT YOU MUST HAVE THE TOKEN. The very
[1:13:11] life that was in Christ is new. When I
[1:13:13] see that, I'll pass over you. So don't
[1:13:16] just stay with a we don't I don't want
[1:13:18] to stay I don't want to stay just with a
[1:13:21] stamp that I'm a I'm a I'm a message
[1:13:23] believer, you know. I can argue. I can
[1:13:27] put quotes together. I can do. No, that
[1:13:28] that's that's good. THAT'S VERY GOOD.
[1:13:31] BUT THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH. I want the
[1:13:33] life THAT IS THE MESSAGE. I WANT TO
[1:13:36] APPLY THE MESSAGE. I WANT TO LIVE the
[1:13:39] message. I want the MESSAGE TO BE
[1:13:41] SPEAKING WITHOUT ME SPEAKING. I WANT MY
[1:13:44] LIFE TO BE MANIFEST IN CHRIST. AMEN. IN
[1:13:46] THE WAY I TALK, IN THE WAY I THINK, IN
[1:13:48] THE WAY I SPEAK, IN MY DECISIONS, IN ALL
[1:13:51] THINGS. LORD, I WANT TO DRAW NIGH UNTO
[1:13:53] YOU, LORD. I WANT YOU TO BE MANIFEST IN
[1:13:56] MY LIFE. THAT'S MY BURDEN. THAT'S MY
[1:13:58] DESIRE. LORD, I WANT TO MOVE FURTHER
[1:14:00] THAN I HAVE DONE BEFORE.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Because that the principle of growing.
[1:14:07] Growing is to draw is have that desire
[1:14:10] to draw n to go to God. You might say,
[1:14:12] "How can I draw n to God? How can I draw
[1:14:15] unto God?" Just start by obedience.
[1:14:18] Obedience entitles you to the token.
[1:14:21] Start by obedience. Amen. It's amazing
[1:14:23] how
[1:14:26] it's amazing how sometimes we spend so
[1:14:28] much time to build at that foundation,
[1:14:30] but it's a good foundation. But Hebrews
[1:14:33] 6:1 says, "Therefore, leaving the
[1:14:34] principle of the doctrine of Christ, let
[1:14:37] us go on to perfection, not laying again
[1:14:40] the foundation of repentance from dead
[1:14:42] works and our faith towards God."
[1:14:47] Very good. Right? Because sometimes we
[1:14:49] can just stay on the faith level, right?
[1:14:51] say our faith level and heaven
[1:14:53] justification level and everything.
[1:14:56] Amen. Praise be to God. I like that. I
[1:14:59] like preaching on grace. I like it's my
[1:15:02] favorite messages. I'm there because I
[1:15:05] feel so incapable on my own. I just rely
[1:15:08] on God's grace. But it it's not going to
[1:15:10] do me good if I'm always staying there.
[1:15:13] If I only No. Oh, God forgives me. God
[1:15:17] doesn't look at my mistakes. If I always
[1:15:19] stay there, I'll become a lazy
[1:15:21] Christians. I become sometime someone
[1:15:24] who start excusing everything. I'll just
[1:15:26] make it. My name is really written in
[1:15:28] the book. No, no, no, no. It's good. But
[1:15:30] don't stay there too long. You need a a
[1:15:33] message of where he kicks you a little
[1:15:36] bit. Say, "No, shake up. You are lazy.
[1:15:39] You are NOT STAND UP. WORK for me. Be in
[1:15:42] the business OF GOD. BE A SERVANT for
[1:15:45] God." THEN HE SHAKES YOU a little bit.
[1:15:47] And I I like that. But says we don't
[1:15:49] want a social gospel all the time. A
[1:15:53] social gospel to entertain that and to
[1:15:55] pat that on the on the back and say you
[1:15:57] are good. Whatever you do it's fine. No
[1:16:00] then you probably then oh yeah IT'S GOOD
[1:16:04] BUT NO LORD in this new year I want to
[1:16:07] go further. I want to be a ragged
[1:16:09] Christian. I WANT TO BE A SOLID
[1:16:11] CHRISTIAN. [clears throat] I WANT TO BE
[1:16:12] FERVENT. I WANT I WANT TO BE WORKING
[1:16:16] WORK WORK.
[1:16:17] WE'LL TOUCH THAT. YOU WORK as if
[1:16:20] salvation depending on works.
[1:16:23] YOU WORK [screaming] HARD. [laughter]
[1:16:26] YOU WORK HARD AS IF SALVATION DEPENDING
[1:16:29] ON WORKS.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Because we don't work hard enough
[1:16:36] because oh no, it's not on works. It's
[1:16:38] on grace. Just it's okay. Just make a
[1:16:42] little prayer and oh God, it has been a
[1:16:46] a busy day.
[1:16:48] Amen. And [clears throat] you sleep. I'm
[1:16:51] going the rapture. Hallelujah. In the
[1:16:53] church. Well, let's read the Bible. AND
[1:16:56] YOU A FAMILY ALONE. And
[1:16:59] just one God. Hallelujah. Praise be.
[1:17:01] Let's close our Bible. Let God lazy lazy
[1:17:05] lazy. And we want to revive in the
[1:17:08] church. No.
[1:17:11] TOO MUCH [screaming] ON GRACE. GRACE,
[1:17:12] GRACE. NO.
[1:17:16] WORK AS IF SALVATION DEPENDED ON IT.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; LORD, I WANT TO PRAY.
[1:17:22] Talking about fasting in the message.
[1:17:24] Oh, no. No. THAT'S THE OLD TIME. WHY
[1:17:26] shall I fast now? We have the
[1:17:28] bridegroom. We have the husband. The No,
[1:17:32] I fast. THE LAST TIME I FASTED 20 YEARS
[1:17:35] AGO WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR A JOB. THEN
[1:17:37] that's when I fasted. When I was looking
[1:17:39] for my wife. than when I FASTED ONE TIME
[1:17:42] ONLY HALF day
[1:17:44] lazy Christians. No,
[1:17:47] but but Lord, oh God, I I want I want to
[1:17:52] work for you. I want to be after my
[1:17:54] father's business. I I I want I want I
[1:17:57] want that travail of the soul
[1:17:59] constantly. Lord, brother Bam was
[1:18:02] praying. Brother Bam was fasting. But
[1:18:05] when I WAS SPENDING TIME in reading the
[1:18:07] word OF STUDYING THE WORD AND PRAYING.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN. But why? THE FINAL VOICE TO THE
[1:18:14] FINAL CHURCH. [screaming] AMEN. BUT lazy
[1:18:17] in prayer, lazy in reading the Bible.
[1:18:19] Laz in listening the message. Oh. Oh
[1:18:23] Lord, help me to draw nigh unto you,
[1:18:25] Lord. For this new year, I desire to
[1:18:27] draw nigh unto you, Lord. Desire to
[1:18:29] serve you more than ever before.
[1:18:41] Amen.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Then it says,
[1:18:48] they say, "Let us go on to perfection,
[1:18:51] not laying again the foundation of
[1:18:52] repentance from dead works and of faith
[1:18:54] towards God, of the doctrine of baptism,
[1:18:56] and of laying on of hands, of
[1:18:58] resurrection of the dead, and of eternal
[1:19:00] judgment. And this will do if God
[1:19:02] permits. If you have time, we will
[1:19:04] always come back to it. We like that
[1:19:05] myself personally like one of my my
[1:19:08] favorite sermons is preach on that.
[1:19:11] But Paul is talking in the same chapters
[1:19:13] and says talk about those who started
[1:19:15] well with faith but along the way that
[1:19:18] faith did not produce the works of
[1:19:19] faith. They say they fell down the
[1:19:22] Hebrews 16 and then become the
[1:19:25] borderline Christians because their
[1:19:27] faith didn't produce the works. then
[1:19:29] become borderline Christians. Then at
[1:19:31] the same chapter it says but for God is
[1:19:33] not unrighteous to forget your work and
[1:19:36] labor of love which you have showed
[1:19:38] towards his name and that you have
[1:19:40] ministered to the saints and to
[1:19:41] ministers and we desire that every one
[1:19:44] of you do show the same diligence to the
[1:19:46] full assurance of hope onto the hand
[1:19:49] that ye be not slothful but followers of
[1:19:52] them who through faith and patience
[1:19:54] inherit the promises. Do not become
[1:19:57] slothful. Do not become lazy.
[1:20:01] Amen.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; I hope I'm not punching on you. I'm
[1:20:05] preaching to myself. I am just preaching
[1:20:07] to my If it's not for you, it's for me.
[1:20:10] I don't want to become a lazy preacher.
[1:20:12] I don't want to become a lazy who just p
[1:20:15] compiles quotes and then bring a
[1:20:17] message. No, that I don't want that. I
[1:20:20] want to spend time in prayers. I want to
[1:20:22] spend time in studying the word of God.
[1:20:24] I want to spend time in consecration.
[1:20:26] AND [laughter] THAT'S MY DESIRE. AMEN. I
[1:20:29] DON'T WANT THE EASY way and just pass by
[1:20:32] and it will be just okay. But no, no,
[1:20:34] no, Lord. Let me let me dedicate myself.
[1:20:37] LET ME SPEND TIME WITH YOU, LORD. LET ME
[1:20:40] BE THERE. I WANT TO BE THERE. I WANT TO
[1:20:42] DRAW NIGH TO YOU MORE THAN ever before.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; That sister is not the Oh, she's here. I
[1:20:49] can't say that testimony, but but she
[1:20:51] she struck my heart one time. I want to
[1:20:53] mention name. Just struck my heart. that
[1:20:56] little girl and just say, you know,
[1:20:58] pastor, today I'm fasting. I'm praying
[1:21:02] that that thought never get left me. Oh
[1:21:05] God, thank you for that little girl.
[1:21:07] Thank that little girl. She's just
[1:21:08] praying for the church, for her life.
[1:21:12] It's been hard long time. I heard that
[1:21:14] little girl say, "God, I'm I fast. I'm
[1:21:17] praying fasting today."
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; We need more of that. Amen.
[1:21:32] prophet says you can't. No, I'm just
[1:21:35] putting a balance here, but I will get
[1:21:36] out of it
[1:21:39] because I'm aware of what the prophet
[1:21:41] says, but [snorts] I'm I'm I'm just in
[1:21:43] that limb of works. So, no matter what
[1:21:46] you do, you quit drinking, quit smoking,
[1:21:48] quit telling lies, go to church and try
[1:21:50] to this and try to do that, you still
[1:21:53] corner. That's just the law. The law
[1:21:55] makes nothing perfect. What makes
[1:21:57] perfect is Christ. Glory. I might quit
[1:22:00] lying, quit stealing, quit committing
[1:22:02] adultery, quit chewing, quit all the
[1:22:05] things, and I'm still carnal. God
[1:22:07] doesn't receive it because I have
[1:22:09] nothing to offer him in propitiation.
[1:22:12] But the minute that I lay my hands upon
[1:22:14] the blessed head of the Lord Jesus and
[1:22:16] say, "Lord, I'm no good. Will you take
[1:22:19] me as your servant?" God kisses away my
[1:22:22] sin. I stand perfect in the sight of
[1:22:24] God. That's right. Why? I'm not standing
[1:22:27] on my own merit. I'm standing on his. He
[1:22:30] has perfected us through his suffering
[1:22:32] and his blood. And see, it's time to
[1:22:35] It's time to close. I want to finish
[1:22:37] reading. And then he continues says,
[1:22:39] "For the law made nothing perfect by the
[1:22:41] bringing in of a perfect hope did by the
[1:22:43] which we draw nigh unto God through all
[1:22:47] our goodness and all our goodness and
[1:22:49] all our goodness and all of our
[1:22:52] goodness." So the prophet himself
[1:22:53] repeating we are still corner but once
[1:22:56] in the presence of God recognizing that
[1:22:58] we could never stand there only through
[1:23:00] the merit of Jesus Christ then we draw
[1:23:03] nigh unto God through the merit of his
[1:23:06] son. So we have to be very specific.
[1:23:09] Salvation doesn't it doesn't dep that is
[1:23:12] not based on your works. Your works
[1:23:15] cannot save you. Amen. The works can
[1:23:18] never save you. You can't say God
[1:23:19] because I've done this I've done this I
[1:23:21] haven't done that so now I deserve to be
[1:23:23] saved. No it it will fail. You have
[1:23:26] nothing you can present to God for your
[1:23:28] salvation. So I'm not preaching
[1:23:30] salvation through works. That's not
[1:23:32] correct. Amen. salvation. It's only
[1:23:35] through the blood of Jesus Christ,
[1:23:37] through the righteousness of Jesus
[1:23:39] Christ. Even no matter what you can do,
[1:23:41] you cannot claim it as a basic for your
[1:23:44] salvation. That's wrong. That's wrong.
[1:23:46] That's wrong. Amen. But if you are
[1:23:48] saved, you have to do the right works.
[1:23:51] Amen. If you are saved, you have to do
[1:23:53] the right. If you're not doing the right
[1:23:55] things and you claim you are being you
[1:23:57] are saved, that's wrong. Amen. Because
[1:23:59] you are not there yet. If you ARE SAVED,
[1:24:02] YOU HAVE TO bring those right. Amen. Can
[1:24:05] you see a child say I'm alive but I'm
[1:24:07] not breathing but I'm alive. No, you are
[1:24:10] not alive. You are if you're not dead,
[1:24:12] you are actually going to die. Amen.
[1:24:15] That's what he see. SO YOU HAVE TO BE
[1:24:17] THERE. IT HAVE TO BE MANIFESTED. LORD, I
[1:24:20] don't want to stay lazy. I will die if I
[1:24:22] stay lazy.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Something has to QUICKEN ME. I HAVE to
[1:24:26] be IN REVIVAL. BUT BUT MANY times you
[1:24:28] will come say, "Lord, I NEED A REVIVAL.
[1:24:30] OTHERWISE, I'LL DIE. I NEED A REVIVAL.
[1:24:34] LORD, SHAKE ME. SHAKE, MOVE ME. HELP ME
[1:24:37] TO GO ON MY KNEES. HELP ME TO PRAY. HELP
[1:24:39] ME TO BE IN THE ATMOSPHERE. OH, GOD. I
[1:24:42] desire that. I don't WANT THAT TO DIE. I
[1:24:44] DON'T WANT I DON'T WANT THE ZEAL TO DIE.
[1:24:47] I DON'T WANT TO BE, you know, as I
[1:24:51] usually say in many places where I
[1:24:53] preach, I don't I don't want to be a
[1:24:54] Christian of emergency. Only in
[1:24:57] emergency, I wake up. only when THERE IS
[1:24:59] A SITUATION IS HARD I WAKE UP WHEN
[1:25:01] THERE'S SICKNESS THEN I WAKE UP WHEN
[1:25:03] WHEN THERE IS A FINANCIAL TROUBLE THEN I
[1:25:05] WAKE UP I DON'T WANT THAT KIND OF LIFE
[1:25:07] WHETHER THERE IS SICKNESS WHETHER I'M IN
[1:25:10] HEALTH WHETHER IS A JOB WHERE I DON'T
[1:25:11] HAVE A JOB I WANT TO REMAIN A CHRISTIAN
[1:25:14] WHO LOVE THE [screaming] LORD ALL THE
[1:25:15] TIME NOT EMERGENCY CASE CHRISTIANS NO I
[1:25:19] DON'T LIKE THAT ANY MAN ANY religious
[1:25:22] person can do that amen I want more LORD
[1:25:26] I WANT PROSPERITY HER AND THEN YOU COME.
[1:25:29] OH, they
[1:25:30] they they left me. Oh, they they
[1:25:33] [clears throat] put they FIRED ME FROM
[1:25:34] MY JOB. THEN YOU COME TO CHURCH. NO,
[1:25:36] [screaming] NO, NO, NO. ALL THE TIME.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; EPHESIANS, Ephesians 1 is the book of
[1:25:51] Ephesians is the book of adoption. The
[1:25:53] prophet says, "Blessed be the God and
[1:25:55] father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has
[1:25:57] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[1:25:59] in heavenly places in Christ."
[1:26:02] That's what we are. He has blessed us
[1:26:05] already in all spiritual blessings in
[1:26:07] heavenly places in Christ. According
[1:26:09] chosen us in him before the foundation
[1:26:11] of the world that we should be holy and
[1:26:14] without blame before him in love. That's
[1:26:17] that that that that's what the prophet
[1:26:19] likes to put and says and he will say
[1:26:22] you know God doesn't want a Christians
[1:26:24] you can't be a solid Christians if you
[1:26:26] believe that today you are saved and
[1:26:28] tomorrow you are lost and today I'm
[1:26:30] saved you are basing that on your
[1:26:32] emotions no you can't be a solid
[1:26:34] Christian thank God for the message of
[1:26:36] the hour to put a solid foundation to
[1:26:38] put a solid foundation of faith you it's
[1:26:41] by revelation God has given YOU THAT BY
[1:26:44] FAITH THANK GOD FOR THE FAITH I I KNOW
[1:26:47] THAT I'm saved. No matter what, I know
[1:26:49] that I'm saved. I CAN MIGHT STUMBLE, BUT
[1:26:52] I'M STILL SAVED. AMEN. PRAISE BE TO GOD.
[1:26:54] BECAUSE HE HE CHOSE ME BEFORE THE
[1:26:57] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. BEFORE I'VE
[1:26:58] DONE ANYTHING, BEFORE I DONE ANYTHING,
[1:27:01] HE CHOSE ME. HE LOVED ME. WHEN I WAS IN
[1:27:03] THE WORST PERSON, before even believing
[1:27:06] the message of the hour, HE STILL LOVED
[1:27:08] ME. HE STILL CHOSE ME. AMEN. AMEN. SO
[1:27:11] THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN TURN HIM AWAY
[1:27:13] NO MATTER WHAT. BUT NOW MY OWN ATTITUDE
[1:27:16] TOWARDS HIM BECAUSE of the love that is
[1:27:18] EXPRESSED TO ME. LORD, I want to serve
[1:27:21] YOU WITH ALL MY HEART. I WANT TO GIVE
[1:27:23] YOU EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE WITH ALL MY
[1:27:26] HEART. I WANT TO DRAW NIGH TO YOU, LORD,
[1:27:28] BECAUSE YOU WILL DRAW NIGH TO ME. YOU
[1:27:30] WILL MANIFEST IT MORE TO ME. AMEN.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; The God has chosen us in him before the
[1:27:38] foundation that he should be holy and
[1:27:40] without blame. said having predestinated
[1:27:42] us unto the adoption of the children by
[1:27:45] Jesus Christ himself according to the
[1:27:47] good pleasure of his will. So the
[1:27:49] adoption is only predestinated before
[1:27:52] the foundation of the world. Amen. As I
[1:27:55] preached one time the new birth is the
[1:27:56] earnest of the redemption until the day
[1:27:59] of the redemption. I touched that and
[1:28:01] many brothers has spoke on that spoken
[1:28:03] on that. Brother Gilbert touched on that
[1:28:04] wonderfully. Chapter one, chapter two.
[1:28:07] The prophet says the book of Ephesians
[1:28:09] pulls things together. He takes the
[1:28:11] Armenian, the Calvinist, he put them
[1:28:13] together. I ask not to think of he says
[1:28:16] grace is what God did for me. Works is
[1:28:18] what I do for him. If you climb on
[1:28:21] either one of the limbs, you will be
[1:28:23] sure find yourself on the end on the
[1:28:25] limb and then can't get back. The book
[1:28:27] of Ephesians pulls it together. I think
[1:28:30] I would say that many places the book of
[1:28:32] Ephesians take that together. But you
[1:28:34] know the book of Ephesians talks about
[1:28:37] the faith and it talks about the
[1:28:39] predestination even the adoption is
[1:28:42] giving the good foundation of that only
[1:28:45] in the very few chapters of it. Chapter
[1:28:48] one, chapter 2 maybe chapter three a
[1:28:50] little bit the first part of chapter 3
[1:28:52] is give us a good foundation of faith
[1:28:56] but after that it only works.
[1:29:00] Then he start talking but we we stop
[1:29:02] sometimes only on we NOW IT'S EPHESIANS
[1:29:05] DON'T DON'T DON'T talk about works only
[1:29:08] Ephesians yeah but Ephesians talks about
[1:29:10] works
[1:29:11] we look on chapter three it talks about
[1:29:13] tribulations so no you have to go to
[1:29:16] tribulations don't don't don't be don't
[1:29:18] don't don't be don't don't stumble when
[1:29:20] you have tribulations chapter three the
[1:29:22] last part of tribulation then we go to
[1:29:24] chapter four we mentioned that last
[1:29:25] Sunday talk about the five-fold ministry
[1:29:28] talk about the the body of Christ. Every
[1:29:30] part of the body supplies together. Oh,
[1:29:33] that's part of adoption. YES, THAT'S
[1:29:35] PART OF ADOPTIONS. GOD NEEDS YOU. GOD
[1:29:37] NEEDS ME. IT'S PART OF IT. AMEN. WE HAVE
[1:29:40] TO WORK TOGETHER IN PARTNERSHIP. IT'S
[1:29:42] PART OF IT. CHAPTER FIVE IS TALKING
[1:29:45] ABOUT FAMILIES. TALKING ABOUT THE
[1:29:46] FATHER, THE MOTHER, THE BROTHER, AND THE
[1:29:49] SISTERS. AMEN. THE SERVANTS, THE
[1:29:52] MASTERS, THE THINGS WE HAVE TO DO WORKS
[1:29:56] ON TOP OF IT MEANS WE HAVE A SOLID
[1:29:58] FOUNDATION NOW ON TOP OF IT FOR THE
[1:30:01] GODLINESS AND ALL THINGS YOU HAVE TO
[1:30:02] WORK. DON'T DO THIS, DO THIS, DON'T DO
[1:30:05] THIS, DO THIS, DON'T DO THIS, DON'T DO
[1:30:07] THIS. BUT I THANK GOD FOR PROPHET
[1:30:10] PUTTING THAT TOGETHER. It's not what you
[1:30:12] are doing is saving you. No, WHAT IS
[1:30:15] SAVING YOU IS GOD CHOSE YOU BEFORE THE
[1:30:17] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. BUT AS HE CHOSE
[1:30:19] YOU BEFORE THE FOUNDATION AS YOU ARE
[1:30:21] WALKING YOUR LIFE IS EXPRESSING
[1:30:23] [screaming] IT TO GET TO THE ADOPTION.
[1:30:26] THAT FAITH HAS TO COME TO THE
[1:30:27] PERFECTION. AMEN. [snorts] THE
[1:30:29] PERFECTION IS NOT ONLY THE FAITH. NO THE
[1:30:32] PERFECTION IS THAT FAITH COME INTO LIFE.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Lord I want my life to match what I'm
[1:30:41] confessing.

[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:52] And it says Ephesians 6:10
[1:30:55] 18. Finally, my brethren, be strong in
[1:30:58] the Lord. Be strong in the Lord. In the
[1:31:02] power of his might. Put on the whole
[1:31:04] armor of God. In Ephesians, put on the
[1:31:08] whole armor of God. You do that. Put on
[1:31:10] the whole armor of God that you may be
[1:31:12] able to stand against the viles of the
[1:31:14] devil. For we wrestle not against the
[1:31:17] flesh and the blood, but against
[1:31:18] principalities, against powers, against
[1:31:21] the rulers of the darkness of this
[1:31:22] world, against spiritual wickedness in
[1:31:24] high places. Wherefore take upon unto
[1:31:27] you the whole arm of God, that you may
[1:31:30] be able to withstand in the evil day,
[1:31:32] and having done all TO STAND. STAND
[1:31:35] THEREFORE, having your loins girth about
[1:31:38] with truth, having on the press the
[1:31:40] breastplate of righteousness, and your
[1:31:43] feet short with the preparation of the
[1:31:45] gospel of peace. Above all, taking the
[1:31:48] shield of faith, wherewith you shall be
[1:31:50] able to quench all the fiery doubts of
[1:31:52] the wicked, and take the helmet of
[1:31:55] salvation, and the sword of the spirit,
[1:31:57] which is the word of God. Take the WORD
[1:31:59] OF GOD. AMEN. PRAYING ALWAYS with all
[1:32:02] prayer and supplication the spirit and
[1:32:05] watching there onto with all
[1:32:06] perseverance and supplication for all
[1:32:09] saints.
[1:32:10] But but but Paul I thought only let me
[1:32:13] talk about predestinations that that my
[1:32:16] adoptions. No yes that the foundation
[1:32:18] for adoptions but you have to put all
[1:32:21] those things together. Make sure that
[1:32:24] you take make sure that you pray. Make
[1:32:26] sure that YOU TAKE THE WORD of God. MAKE
[1:32:28] SURE THAT you that YOU TAKE THE SWORD OF
[1:32:30] THE WORD OF GOD IN ORDER TO STAND.
[1:32:32] OTHERWISE, YOU WILL FALL. YOU HAVE TO
[1:32:34] STAND. YOU'RE NOT GOING WE ARE NOT GOING
[1:32:37] THE RAPTURE JUST BARELY MAKING IT. NO,
[1:32:41] WE ARE GOING THE RAPTURE STANDING ON
[1:32:43] GOD'S PROMISES. I'M A [screaming] I'M A
[1:32:45] SOLDIER OF THE CROSS. I'M THE SOLDIER OF
[1:32:48] THE MESSAGE. I OWN THE MESSAGE OF THE
[1:32:50] HOUR. IT'S MY MESSAGE. AMEN. I'M
[1:32:52] STANDING UPON IT. AMEN. I'M DEFENDING
[1:32:55] THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. AMEN.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE IN THE LAND OF CANAAN, YOU ARE
[1:33:01] DEFENDING THE LAND OF CANAAN. BEING IN
[1:33:03] THE LAND OF CANAAN, IN THE LAND OF THE
[1:33:06] HOLY GHOST, YOU ARE IN THE LAND OF THE
[1:33:07] PROMISE, YOU ARE DEFENDING YOUR BORDERS.
[1:33:09] AMEN. YOU ARE DEFENDING YOUR YOUR YOUR
[1:33:12] FRONTIERS. YOU ARE YOU ARE PUTTING THE
[1:33:14] THINGS ASIDE THAT CANNOT COME THROUGH
[1:33:15] YOUR LANDS. YOU ARE DEFENDING YOUR
[1:33:17] LANDS. EVERY INCH OF YOUR LAND, YOU ARE
[1:33:19] STANDING UPON IT. AMEN.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD.
[1:33:24] Let's draw nigh unto God. God will bless
[1:33:27] us tremendously
[1:33:28] if we draw nigh unto God.
[1:33:35] How can I draw n unto him? Brother
[1:33:37] Moses, put on the whole armor of God.
[1:33:41] If you pray, God will draw nigh unto
[1:33:44] you. Amen.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; If you meditate upon the word of God
[1:33:48] each morning, every night, God will draw
[1:33:51] nigh unto you
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; in a much greater way
[1:33:56] than before.
[1:34:02] The same principle goes in Deuteronomy
[1:34:04] 28
[1:34:06] in the Old Testament says, "It shall
[1:34:07] come to pass if you shall hearken
[1:34:10] diligently unto the voice of the Lord
[1:34:12] thy God to observe and to do all his
[1:34:13] commandments which I command thee this
[1:34:15] day, that the Lord thy God will set thee
[1:34:18] on high above all nations of the earth.
[1:34:21] And all these blessings shall come on
[1:34:23] thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt
[1:34:25] hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy
[1:34:27] God." It's a promise. In the desert, you
[1:34:31] have the mana. You have things that
[1:34:33] they're giving to you freely and all the
[1:34:35] different things and they didn't have to
[1:34:37] work and everything just given. But once
[1:34:39] you go into the land of the Holy Ghost,
[1:34:42] you have to fight for everything. You
[1:34:45] have to fight for your joy. Amen. You
[1:34:48] have to fight for you you fight as if it
[1:34:50] depended the salvation depended on your
[1:34:52] works. That's the key. You fight as if
[1:34:55] the salvation depended on your works.
[1:35:00] If you don't have that in mind, you I
[1:35:02] will get it. Prophet himself say myself.
[1:35:05] I'm I'm working hard. I'm working out my
[1:35:08] own salvation. The prophet will say many
[1:35:10] time because because as we believe that
[1:35:14] your name is written in the lamb's book
[1:35:16] of life, it's only faith.
[1:35:19] You never saw your name as written white
[1:35:22] and white. Say, "Okay, this is your
[1:35:23] name. You can never be lost. Whatever
[1:35:27] you do, that's a wrong understanding. I
[1:35:30] can do whatever I do because my name,
[1:35:32] show me where your name is." No, it's
[1:35:34] only faith. You just believe it as
[1:35:37] myself. I'm believing it.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; But there is no material proof to show
[1:35:41] it.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; But I'm working out because I believe my
[1:35:45] name is there. So I'm working out my own
[1:35:48] salvation believing my name is there. I
[1:35:51] don't want at the end of the works no
[1:35:53] look you were living and who told you
[1:35:55] that your name was there.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; So we sometime we switch it the wrong
[1:36:01] wrong way. No no no you
[1:36:04] I don't want to get on my note but but
[1:36:06] you get my idea right.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; You live as if your salvation depended
[1:36:11] on your works.
[1:36:14] In all the churches today till I last
[1:36:17] the last last it's the last sermon of
[1:36:19] the week. You will be blessed next year.
[1:36:21] You will be millionaires. You will have
[1:36:23] this. Amen. Hallelujah. GOD IS AMEN.
[1:36:27] HALLELUJAH.
[1:36:29] I'm not against that. The pro part of
[1:36:31] the promise of God. Amen. Claim every
[1:36:33] promise of God. But the secret I'm
[1:36:35] giving you for your prosperity of next
[1:36:37] year. Draw nigh unto God. Amen.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; If we all draw nigh unto God, he will
[1:36:45] bless us beyond our expectations.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; He knows our natural needs. He knows the
[1:36:51] things we're going even in this in the
[1:36:52] sickness in the body. He knows all these
[1:36:54] things. Seek first the kingdom of God.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Draw nigh unto God. God will give you
[1:37:00] more than even what you ask.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; That's the secret of blessings.
[1:37:11] One brother shared with us
[1:37:13] this go this go thing that was in
[1:37:15] WhatsApp group says proverb 24:16
[1:37:18] for a just man fallth seven times and
[1:37:20] riseth up again but the wicked shall
[1:37:23] fall into mischief like the way he kind
[1:37:26] of put it it says you know as you draw n
[1:37:29] to god as you draw n to god you might
[1:37:32] make mistakes you might fall but you
[1:37:35] have a scripture to back you up a last
[1:37:37] man fallth seven times and riseth up
[1:37:41] again but the wicked shall fall into
[1:37:43] mischief. If you look at the scripture
[1:37:45] here who falls many times is not the is
[1:37:49] not the wicked one is the righteous one.
[1:37:52] The righteous one falls seven times. The
[1:37:55] wicked falls only one time. But the
[1:37:58] secret is upon rising up. The righteous
[1:38:02] falls is righteous but he falls but he
[1:38:06] stand up. God raise him up. God make HIM
[1:38:09] TO STAND UP ONCE AGAIN. BUT THE ONE
[1:38:11] WHO'S not righteous, he he falls once he
[1:38:13] falls, HE FALLS FOREVER. HE GONE. AMEN.
[1:38:16] BUT YOU MIGHT FALL. BUT PRAISE BE TO
[1:38:19] GOD. I'M STANDING UP AGAIN BECAUSE
[1:38:21] EPHESIANS told me I HAVE TO STAND UP
[1:38:23] AGAIN. I FALL, I STAND UP. I FALL, I
[1:38:26] STAND UP. I FALL, I STAND UP. BUT YOU
[1:38:28] KEEP PRESSING ON. YOU KEEP MOVING ON.
[1:38:30] LORD, I WANT I DESIRE TO DONATE TO YOU.
[1:38:32] I KNOW THAT I failed yesterday, but
[1:38:34] that's not the end of the goal. I'M
[1:38:36] STILL PRESSING ON WITH YOU, LORD. I'LL
[1:38:38] STILL COME TO CHURCH. I'LL STILL READ
[1:38:39] THE WORD OF GOD. I'LL STILL PRAY, LORD
[1:38:41] JESUS. I'M DETERMINED TO PRAY EVERY DAY.
[1:38:44] YESTERDAY, I MISSED IT, LORD. BUT,
[1:38:46] FATHER, THAT'S NOT THE END OF TODAY. I
[1:38:47] WILL START AGAIN. I'LL KEEP MOVING ON,
[1:38:50] FATHER. I'LL KEEP PRAISING YOU, LORD.
[1:38:51] I'LL KEEP PRAYING, [screaming] PRAYING,
[1:38:53] PRAYING. AMEN.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; I've had a dedication
[1:39:00] myself in my life. I've dedicated Friday
[1:39:03] night for prayer since I was a young
[1:39:05] boy. My wife can testify it. Fridays is
[1:39:09] for God. I I gave it to God since I was
[1:39:12] young boy. Lord, Friday, I will stay
[1:39:15] faithful to Friday to it's your night no
[1:39:18] matter what.
[1:39:20] Kept it since I was a young boy. But
[1:39:23] there's a Friday sometimes I miss to
[1:39:25] pray. But I dedicated. I didn't do
[1:39:27] anything on that Friday. It was for God.
[1:39:29] But sometimes I miss I miss still pray
[1:39:31] but in the morning or during that week
[1:39:33] said God I'm back to my promise to you
[1:39:35] Lord I still want to pray father give
[1:39:38] this my time let let you replace that
[1:39:40] Friday that I missed because I was busy
[1:39:41] for this but father keep praying I keep
[1:39:44] praying
[1:39:45] draw nigh unto God he shall draw unto
[1:39:48] you
[1:39:57] Chronicles 7:4 if My people which are
[1:40:00] called by my name shall humble
[1:40:01] themselves and pray and seek my face and
[1:40:04] turn from their wicked ways then I will
[1:40:08] hear from heaven and I will forgive
[1:40:10] their sins and will heal their land if
[1:40:14] they humble themsel how can I draw nigh
[1:40:17] to God how can I draw oh God give me
[1:40:20] that spirit of h humility I humble
[1:40:22] myself before you Lord I'm nothing your
[1:40:25] word is right I'm nothing but your word
[1:40:28] is right Father, but I want to draw nigh
[1:40:30] to you, Lord. I want to humble myself. I
[1:40:32] don't I I don't want to take any pride
[1:40:34] on myself. I don't want to say no, this
[1:40:36] doesn't pertain to me, Lord. Father, I
[1:40:37] humble myself to the word of God. And
[1:40:39] you promise that you will heal me. You
[1:40:41] will hear my prayers. You will answer to
[1:40:44] my prayer. You will heal this land. You
[1:40:45] will heal even this land, Lord, if I
[1:40:48] humble myself. That's the principle of
[1:40:50] God. Lord, IF I DRAW NIGH to you, you
[1:40:52] shall draw nigh unto me. YOU WILL BLESS
[1:40:54] ME, FATHER. That's your promise. Amen.
[1:40:58] God God honors humility to the point
[1:41:00] that I like to say it many times to the
[1:41:04] point that God even heard the prayer of
[1:41:06] Hab
[1:41:08] in First Kings 21:27 says if I came to
[1:41:11] pass it came to pass Hab heard those
[1:41:13] words when Hab heard those words that he
[1:41:15] rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon
[1:41:17] his flesh and fasted and lay in
[1:41:19] sackcloth and went softly and the word
[1:41:22] of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite
[1:41:24] saying thou how Hab humble himself said
[1:41:28] before me because he humbled himself
[1:41:30] before me. I will not bring the evil in
[1:41:32] his day but in his son's day will I
[1:41:35] bring the evil upon his house. Humility
[1:41:38] changed the judgment of God because e
[1:41:41] even for Hab who is the most wicked of
[1:41:44] all the KINGS BUT BECAUSE HE had the
[1:41:47] right attitude of humbling himself God
[1:41:50] changed that judgment in his days and
[1:41:52] put ANOTHER DAY. IF GOD could hear the
[1:41:54] prayer of a wicked man AS A HAB, HOW
[1:41:57] MUCH MORE FOR A SON AND A DAUGHTER OF
[1:42:00] GOD WHO FOLLOWS THE APPROACH OF GOD?
[1:42:02] GOD, I'M HUMBLING MYSELF. OH LORD, THIS
[1:42:05] YEAR I JUST WANT TO BE HUMBLE AND OBEY
[1:42:07] YOUR WORD NO MATTER WHAT. LORD, I
[1:42:10] BELIEVE YOU'RE GOING TO BLESS ME,
[1:42:12] FATHER. I DON'T KNOW HOW, BUT YOU WILL
[1:42:14] BLESS. THAT'S YOUR WORD. GOD IS ENTITLED
[1:42:17] TO OBEY HIS TO FOLLOW HIS OWN WORD. HE
[1:42:20] CAN BANKRUPT [screaming] ALL HEAVEN BUT
[1:42:22] HIS WORD CAN NEVER BE BROKEN. AMEN. HIS
[1:42:25] PROMISE CAN NEVER BE BROKEN.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; So this is not only the principle of the
[1:42:33] law under the bulls of God is still
[1:42:36] valid today.
[1:42:38] In Zechariah 1:3 says, "Therefore say
[1:42:40] thou unto them, thou say the Lord of
[1:42:42] hosts, turn ye unto me, say the Lord of
[1:42:45] hosts, and I will turn unto you, say the
[1:42:47] Lord of hosts." Amen.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Zechariah is is the prophet is one of
[1:42:51] the prophet of restoration. You want
[1:42:53] restoration in your family. You want
[1:42:55] restoration in your Christian life.
[1:42:57] Follow this principle. Lord, I will turn
[1:42:59] back to you. Lord, you s you you you you
[1:43:03] the one who saved me. I didn't save
[1:43:04] myself. You took me in the PLACE WHERE I
[1:43:07] WAS SO DOWN. YOU TOOK ME THERE. BUT
[1:43:09] ALONG THE WAY FOR ME GROWING, FATHER,
[1:43:11] NOW IT'S MY turn to turn back to you, to
[1:43:14] seek your face, to looking FOR YOU, TO
[1:43:17] DRAW NIGH TO YOU, LORD. YOU DREW NIGH TO
[1:43:19] ME WHEN I WAS NOTHING, BUT NOW IT'S MY
[1:43:22] TURN TO DRAW NIGH TO YOU, TO TURN BACK
[1:43:24] TO YOU, LORD. I WANT I WANT TO BE CLOSE
[1:43:26] TO YOU AS NEVER BEFORE. NOT [screaming]
[1:43:28] FAR, AS BROTHER ZEKE PRAYED LAST TIME, I
[1:43:31] DON'T WANT TO BE FAR FROM GOD AND SAY,
[1:43:32] "NO, I I'M I'M OKAY. I can do whatever I
[1:43:35] DO BEING FAR FROM GOD." NO, LET ME GET
[1:43:37] CLOSER TO THE WORD OF GOD. LET ME
[1:43:39] APPROACH THE WORD OF GOD. LET ME LIVE
[1:43:42] FAITHFULLY AS MUCH AS I CAN TO THE WORD
[1:43:44] OF GOD. AS OBEDIENT AS I CAN TO THE WORD
[1:43:48] OF GOD.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Not shortcuts.
[1:43:52] Amen.
[1:44:02] Prophet says
[1:44:05] those scriptures might be fulfilled if
[1:44:07] you would only search. If you notice,
[1:44:09] God only reveal himself to those who
[1:44:11] search and long to see him.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, but I thought his is sovereign
[1:44:18] grace. Yes. to pick you up.
[1:44:21] But in your daily walk with God
[1:44:25] now, it's about you how you approach
[1:44:27] him. If you approach him, he reveals
[1:44:30] more to you than you go.
[1:44:34] Even for the preacher,
[1:44:37] he can be so much gifted, but he has to
[1:44:40] be in study. If he does, if he's not
[1:44:43] study,
[1:44:45] very few words will come out of his
[1:44:47] mouth.
[1:44:48] He has to go and search. Brother Banam
[1:44:51] as a prophet is on was he was studying
[1:44:54] the word of God
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; spending time in prayer and study. The
[1:44:58] prophet of the age born a prophet from
[1:45:02] the womb. He was a prophet
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; but he had to study. Amen.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Because God revealed himself more to the
[1:45:11] one who's seeking for him.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Principle of the Bible. Why? Not the law
[1:45:15] and the grace. the same thing
[1:45:21] says draw nigh unto me and I will draw
[1:45:23] nigh unto you say the Lord the prophet
[1:45:25] continues and sometimes God lets things
[1:45:28] happen so that we will draw nigh unto
[1:45:30] him
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; times he allow certain things and then
[1:45:33] you start coming back to him now you
[1:45:35] because you want to attend now you draw
[1:45:37] back to him and then God will bless you
[1:45:39] more bless you more will bless you more
[1:45:42] for God has surely ordained that certain
[1:45:44] things must take place and they will
[1:45:46] unfold All just as as his great time
[1:45:49] clock ticks it off. It's time for God.
[1:45:53] Believe. End of quote there. But I think
[1:45:54] it's time of God that these promises
[1:45:57] will be fulfilled. Are you with me this
[1:45:58] evening this morning? I'm speaking from
[1:46:00] the burden of my heart. Lord, I want to
[1:46:03] draw nigh to you this year. That's
[1:46:04] that's my desire. I desire to draw nigh
[1:46:07] unto you. No matter what the others do,
[1:46:10] but my decision, I want to draw nigh to
[1:46:13] you
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; as never before.
[1:46:17] reaction to an action said I think it
[1:46:19] will be good for prayer meetings to go
[1:46:21] on all the day long long around here
[1:46:24] just everywhere for you cannot get
[1:46:26] anything from God until you get close to
[1:46:29] God you know it's written the scripture
[1:46:32] draw nigh unto me and I will draw nigh
[1:46:33] unto you and if we were here for now for
[1:46:37] one sole purpose that is draw nigh unto
[1:46:39] God amen brother as I say brother Bham
[1:46:43] was 4 fulfill Malachi 4:4 for for the
[1:46:46] first pool, for the second pool, for the
[1:46:47] third pool. He was called for that
[1:46:49] mission. He was called for that work.
[1:46:52] But every time he has to move from the
[1:46:54] even move to the first pool, even move
[1:46:56] to the second pool,
[1:46:59] more emphasizing, moving to the second
[1:47:01] pool, more emphasizing moving to the
[1:47:02] third pool. God has to tell him, you
[1:47:05] have to be more sincere. You have to be
[1:47:07] more sincere. You have to draw nigh to
[1:47:10] me more than how you did on the first
[1:47:12] pull. For the second pool, you ordained
[1:47:14] for it, but you have to be more sincere.
[1:47:17] For the third pool, you ordain for it,
[1:47:19] but you have to be more sincere. Amen.
[1:47:21] In all churches today, we that God will
[1:47:24] give us many blessings to the people if
[1:47:26] this year we become more drawn nearer to
[1:47:30] him than it was before
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; because he's the high priest is still
[1:47:34] pronouncing the blessings upon upon us.
[1:47:36] But we need to get draw near to him than
[1:47:39] it was last before. Amen. Let the
[1:47:42] preacher pray more and dedicate himself
[1:47:44] more to the Lord. Not just the role of a
[1:47:47] preacher, that's not good enough. He has
[1:47:49] to dedicate himself more and pray more
[1:47:52] to God for this new year. Amen. Let the
[1:47:55] song leader pray and dedicate more to
[1:47:57] God. So just no, I just put I know how
[1:48:00] to sing and then I'll just be I'll bring
[1:48:02] emotion in the church. Uh no no that's
[1:48:04] good but that's not good enough. We need
[1:48:07] want him to be dedicated. He want to be
[1:48:09] to be praying. He must BE DEDICATING HIS
[1:48:11] LIFE. THE PREACHER, THE SONG LEADER, ALL
[1:48:14] OF US. AMEN. [screaming]
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE WANT MORE OF GOD.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT.
[1:48:22] We are a full church dedicated for God.
[1:48:24] Amen.
[1:48:26] Let the musician dedicated himself more
[1:48:29] to God. Not casual musicians. No, I just
[1:48:33] No, no. Dedicate myself to God. Come to
[1:48:37] church early, pray, stay in the
[1:48:39] atmosphere. WE WANT MORE OF THE
[1:48:41] BLESSINGS. NOT CASUAL MUSICIANS. NO, NO,
[1:48:44] NO, NO. Don't let light. No, no, no.

[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Is it okay?
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Let the family altar be restored in our
[1:48:55] house.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; Not no occasionally. No, no. Let let be
[1:49:00] serious this year, Lord. I I want to
[1:49:02] draw nigh to you, Lord. Amen.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Because the blessings of the family
[1:49:05] altar will be spilled upon the church.
[1:49:07] It will come into the church. As our
[1:49:09] families are strong, the church will be
[1:49:11] stronger. If we draw nigh to clo to God
[1:49:15] in our families, our church will be
[1:49:17] blessed. Amen.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Let the DEACONS COME ON TIME TO CHURCH.
[1:49:23] Let the deacons, we have two deacons
[1:49:25] now. Let's pray for them for the work.

[1:49:30] can come to church. AMEN.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD, WE DESIRE EVERYTHING TO BE IN
[1:49:34] ORDER. HELP US, LORD JESUS CHRIST.
[1:49:36] THAT'S OUR DESIRE. THAT'S OUR
[1:49:37] [screaming] CRY. WE PRAY WE our deacon.

[1:49:43] us, Lord.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; He's sharing the same burden as our
[1:49:52] brother Philip is sharing the same
[1:49:54] burden. He put a request last time as we
[1:49:57] expressed that desire to him. We say,
[1:49:58] "Lord, pastor, can we can you ask the
[1:50:00] church to pray for me so that they can
[1:50:02] give me a little bit of work on a
[1:50:03] Sunday? I don't want just to be a deacon
[1:50:05] of a title. No, I want to be there,
[1:50:07] Lord. I want to be on my post duty.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; Thank God. Help us."
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the deacon. [snorts]
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; And they have that burden. The Sunday
[1:50:17] school teacher, let the her be
[1:50:19] dedicated, not just the casual filling
[1:50:22] time. No, no, no, no. [clears throat] Be
[1:50:24] dedicated. I want to get time. I want to
[1:50:27] be there. Right, sweetheart?
[1:50:32] I can point her because she's she's
[1:50:34] she's mine.
[1:50:39] Now listen this. This church must not be
[1:50:42] operated like a church in a survival
[1:50:45] mode.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; It's not a church in a survival mode.
[1:50:52] So let's just do it to fill in time of
[1:50:55] surviving and then no
[1:50:58] Lord in my post of duty that I am let me
[1:51:02] be as faithful as possible as if it was
[1:51:06] a big church.
[1:51:08] Let me be faithful as it was.
[1:51:12] Even if just three people come to the
[1:51:14] church, you are faithful in those three
[1:51:16] people. Each person be faithful to his
[1:51:19] own to his post duty. Let move that
[1:51:23] mentality of they know it it a small
[1:51:25] church only the big church will try to
[1:51:28] be your time so that I will I no one
[1:51:30] will take my spot
[1:51:33] come to church to be to keep your spot
[1:51:36] in the big church that's why you are
[1:51:38] early on time no but here whether
[1:51:41] someone takes my place doesn't take my
[1:51:43] place I have a dedicated place I will
[1:51:46] still come on time and pray and dedicate
[1:51:50] myself Lord I desire to draw nigh unto
[1:51:52] you, Lord. It's not it's it's not a it's
[1:51:55] not a secondass church. No,
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; this is a it's it's it's our church.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; We we we are going to the same rapture
[1:52:05] as any other church.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Why Why are we belittling ourselves
[1:52:12] down?
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:16] If you mention about the second service
[1:52:17] on Sunday,
[1:52:20] three people will show up. That's for
[1:52:22] the big church. Our small church, no one
[1:52:24] will show up. But why are we belittling
[1:52:27] ourselves a secondass church? I'm not
[1:52:30] the pastor of a second class church. A
[1:52:33] survival mode. No,
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be a pastor of a second
[1:52:37] church. A secondass church. Just take
[1:52:40] anyone. Anyone can preach. Anyone can
[1:52:42] anyone can do this. No, ju just to
[1:52:44] survive, just to make things work. No,
[1:52:49] what am I going to tell God? No, I want
[1:52:52] just to keep member. I can't mention
[1:52:53] those things because
[1:52:55] if if if that family leave the church is
[1:52:58] is empty. No, Lord, let me preach
[1:53:01] faithfully
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; to one person to two person, let me
[1:53:05] preach the word of God fully. The word
[1:53:08] of God without compromise. IT'S NOT A
[1:53:11] SECONDASS CHURCH. is the bride of THE
[1:53:14] LORD JESUS CHRIST. PREACH ON GRACE.
[1:53:17] PREACH ON THE WORKS. PREACH ON
[1:53:19] EVERYTHING. GIVE EVERYTHING BECAUSE THIS
[1:53:22] BRIDE WILL BE PART OF THE RAPTURE.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT THE CHURCH OF THE FOOLISH
[1:53:27] VIRGIN. THIS IS THE CHURCH OF THE
[1:53:29] [screaming] WISE VIRGIN. BROTHERS AND
[1:53:31] SISTERS,
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING THE RAPTURE.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; ALL OF US.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:53:41] Every revival always comes by the return
[1:53:43] to the word of God.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; My desire is through this time, maybe
[1:53:50] your time as well, go to the church
[1:53:53] order,
[1:53:56] listen to it, see. Oh,
[1:54:00] this is where brother says what put
[1:54:03] these tapes if you can in every church
[1:54:05] to see what the church order is.
[1:54:10] To have a revival things has to be in
[1:54:12] order. The word has to be bought
[1:54:14] restored.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; So, brother many times let's go back to
[1:54:18] the word of God. Let's go back to the
[1:54:20] word of God. Thank God for the message
[1:54:22] of the hour. We are going back to the
[1:54:24] word of God. Not to off truth but the
[1:54:27] whole truth. Amen. Because we want the
[1:54:29] whole revival TO BE WORKING UPON US.
[1:54:32] AMEN. Praise be to God. So you want a
[1:54:35] revival. Go back to the word of God. In
[1:54:38] the book of Jo in in in the Old
[1:54:39] Testament, you see Josiah. Josiah was
[1:54:41] one of of of of a king that God loved
[1:54:44] him. He was after he was like he was
[1:54:46] like his father David. The Bible says I
[1:54:49] think I think the Bible described him as
[1:54:50] one of the most dedicated something like
[1:54:52] that in that line. I forgot that says in
[1:54:54] English. But when he heard when he read
[1:54:57] the the book the the book of the law was
[1:55:00] read to him in 2 Kings 22 his heart was
[1:55:02] broken and said WHY CAN'T WE APPLY THE
[1:55:04] WORD of God why CAN'T WE APPLY THE WORD
[1:55:07] OF GOD IN in in ISRAEL WHY WHY LET'S PUT
[1:55:11] THINGS IN ORDER LET'S PUT THINGS in
[1:55:12] order let's put and when things were put
[1:55:14] in order God removed the judgment on on
[1:55:17] on Israel for his time when he was
[1:55:19] leaving to put another time so it can't
[1:55:21] be fulfilled this time because Josiah to
[1:55:24] return completely ly to God. WE HOLD HIS
[1:55:27] HEART TO THE WORD OF GOD. THEN GOD DREW
[1:55:30] NIGH TO ISRAEL. ONE MORE TIME. THE SAME
[1:55:32] PRINCIPLE IS HEART. WE HAVE THE COVENANT
[1:55:35] OF ISRAEL. AMEN. WE HAVE THE
[1:55:37] UNCONDITIONAL COVENANT. GOD CANNOT DENY
[1:55:39] ISRAEL. He still stay with that Israel.
[1:55:42] But for the blessings, FOR THE BLESSING,
[1:55:44] ISRAEL HAS TO TURN BACK TO GOD. AMEN.
[1:55:46] THE SAME FOR US. IF WE TURN BACK TO GOD
[1:55:49] WITH ALL OUR HEART REALLY SERVING HIM
[1:55:51] WITH ALL OUR HEART, GOD WILL BLESS US
[1:55:53] TREMENDOUSLY. TREMENDOUSLY. AMEN. PRAISE
[1:55:56] BE TO GOD. IT'S OUR PROMISE.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; NOW, let me read it. We need a back to
[1:56:08] the word of God. Back to not back back
[1:56:12] to not some emotion, some talk of back
[1:56:14] to the word, not some talk of a back to
[1:56:17] the word, but I mean the heart and soul
[1:56:20] in the individual, back to the word of
[1:56:23] God.
[1:56:24] Certainly what did you why did you why
[1:56:27] why they afraid to say it you get to
[1:56:29] speaking about it your organization will
[1:56:31] o you out say some people are so if you
[1:56:34] abide in me and my words about you then
[1:56:36] ask what you will that either the truth
[1:56:39] or it is in the truth if it is the truth
[1:56:41] it will work now if you want to know
[1:56:44] where the secret lies the power visions
[1:56:46] and things is back to the word it's the
[1:56:49] word of God any revival we need a
[1:56:52] revival in our church what we need is
[1:56:54] the back to the word of God. But by the
[1:56:56] way, not only to the purpose, but back
[1:56:58] to the WORD OF GOD ALSO IN OBEDIENCE.
[1:57:00] LORD, I DESIRE TO OBEY THE WHOLE WORD OF
[1:57:03] GOD. LET ME GET BACK TO THE WHOLE WORD
[1:57:05] OF GOD. YEAH, MAYBE I WAS not faithful
[1:57:07] there, Lord. Thank God that your grace
[1:57:09] was still upon me today. I'm still
[1:57:11] standing, Father. But Lord, I my desire
[1:57:13] is to serve you greater way in a greater
[1:57:16] greater way. Father
[1:57:19] in one the prophet says if you get if
[1:57:22] you got to get with the word get
[1:57:23] yourself killed out. I'm persuaded that
[1:57:25] many of us friends we have received the
[1:57:28] Holy Ghost but we just receive enough
[1:57:30] Holy Ghost in us to make us to place
[1:57:32] where we don't want to lie or we don't
[1:57:35] want to steal. We don't want to do
[1:57:36] anything. But God wants to feel every
[1:57:39] fiber of his church. He want to feel
[1:57:42] your thinking. He want to feel your
[1:57:44] mind. You want to feel every bit of you
[1:57:47] just make you completely totally dead
[1:57:49] yourself to all your thinking just to
[1:57:52] surrender. So surrendering God till his
[1:57:55] word is just living right through you.
[1:57:58] You don't know nothing else but God's
[1:58:00] word just stay right with his word. It
[1:58:03] is life.
[1:58:05] Not only to be I believe the message
[1:58:07] because I stopped I stopped cheating. Oh
[1:58:09] that that that's the every Christian
[1:58:11] should do that. But father I want to go
[1:58:13] deeper father. I want to wash my
[1:58:16] thinking to think like you to have the
[1:58:18] love of God to forgive. OH GOD BRING ME
[1:58:22] A HIGHER LEVEL LORD JESUS CHRIST AND
[1:58:24] DEDICATION FOR PRAYER for commitment
[1:58:28] living for others. Amen.
[1:58:31] Amen.
[1:58:39] Now let me just running out of time.
[1:58:43] Thought I won't have enough to to
[1:58:46] develop on but thank God for pulling.
[1:58:48] Thank you for pulling.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Help me to.
[1:58:52] Philippians chapter 22:16.
[1:58:55] Wherefore, my beloved, as [snorts] you
[1:58:57] have always obeyed,
[1:58:59] as you have always obeyed,
[1:59:03] and that's our testimony. Not as in my
[1:59:05] presence only, not only the presence of
[1:59:08] the deacon, not only presence of the
[1:59:09] past, not only present, but you have
[1:59:11] obeyed yourself personally, but now much
[1:59:14] more in my absence. Work out your own
[1:59:17] salvation with fear and trembling.
[1:59:20] For it is God which workketh in you both
[1:59:23] to will and to do of his [snorts] good
[1:59:25] pleasure. Do all things without memory
[1:59:28] and disputing. Do all things without
[1:59:31] murmuring disputing that you may be
[1:59:33] blameless and harmless. The sons of God
[1:59:35] without rebuke in the midst of a crooked
[1:59:38] and perversed nation among whom you
[1:59:40] shine as light in the world. You can't
[1:59:43] shine as a light in the world if you are
[1:59:45] living like the world. If you are
[1:59:47] thinking like the world. No, you are not
[1:59:49] shining. YOU ARE LIKE THE WORLD. YOU YOU
[1:59:51] you're living in darkness. But if you
[1:59:53] live according to the WORD OF GOD
[1:59:55] DESPITE THE PERSECUTION, DESPITE YOUR
[1:59:57] SUFFERING, THEN YOU ARE SHINING. Then he
[2:00:00] says, "Holding forth the word of life
[2:00:02] that I may rejoice in the day of Christ
[2:00:04] that I may that I have not run in vain,
[2:00:07] neither labored in vain."
[2:00:10] You trust the Lord in knowing that your
[2:00:12] might not. You trusted the Lord knowing
[2:00:14] that your salvation is already purchased
[2:00:16] by the love by the Lord Jesus Christ and
[2:00:18] nothing can take you away for you. But
[2:00:20] you live as your salvation depended on
[2:00:22] your work. Your work work out your own
[2:00:25] salvation with fear and trembling. The
[2:00:28] prophet says in straight is the gate. He
[2:00:30] says there is sure going to be some
[2:00:31] great disappointment at the judgment. I
[2:00:34] don't want [snorts] it sounds negative
[2:00:35] and it might sound fearful but but let's
[2:00:38] just just allow me to to say it in the
[2:00:41] light of what I've preached this evening
[2:00:42] this morning. Amen. So the bootle but
[2:00:45] the b the bootleger he knows where he's
[2:00:47] going to be at the judgment. So does the
[2:00:49] the beer hound know where he's going to
[2:00:52] be. So does the prostitute know where
[2:00:55] she'll stand. So does the gambler know
[2:00:57] where they'll stand. So does the drunker
[2:00:59] know where they'll stand. He's not he's
[2:01:01] not going to be disappointed. But where
[2:01:03] the disappoint is going to be is those
[2:01:05] who thought they were right. That that's
[2:01:07] where the disappointment. When they go
[2:01:10] up there, they say, "Sh, we cast out
[2:01:12] devils in your name. We are preachers.
[2:01:14] We belong to certain certain certain
[2:01:16] churches. We done great miracles and we
[2:01:19] preached talking to preachers. Oh, we
[2:01:21] preached. I had a gift of preaching and
[2:01:23] all everything is fine. I've been a
[2:01:25] steward in the church. I've been a
[2:01:27] bishop and things. I've been this.
[2:01:29] Depart from me." Prophet says, "Depart
[2:01:31] from me. You workers of iniquity. I
[2:01:33] never even knew. There you are. That's
[2:01:35] the disappointment. He said the children
[2:01:37] of the your children will come in and
[2:01:39] say down at the kingdom say we've got it
[2:01:42] to be here. They will be cast out in out
[2:01:45] of darkness where there will be weeping
[2:01:47] and wailing and nashing of teeth.
[2:01:49] Straight is the gate. Narrow is the way
[2:01:52] that leadth to life. Few there will be
[2:01:54] that find it.
[2:01:57] Let me tell you
[2:02:00] the hardest part of the message that we
[2:02:02] have received
[2:02:05] is not the grace part.
[2:02:10] Who will refuse the grace part?
[2:02:13] The grace part is not the hard is not
[2:02:15] what makes the message the narrow path.
[2:02:18] What makes the message the narrow path
[2:02:21] is the work path of the Holy Spirit in
[2:02:24] the people.
[2:02:26] That's where things get narrowed. Says
[2:02:29] no that that that wasn't a time of
[2:02:32] brother. Not in our time. That's a time
[2:02:35] where they have they didn't have two
[2:02:37] three jobs. That's not not but in our
[2:02:39] time is hard. No.
[2:02:42] But how can you shine if you are doing
[2:02:45] like the world? Your only way to shine
[2:02:49] is to prove that no matter how the world
[2:02:51] is going, you stand with the word of God
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; and apply the word of God. Lord, I
[2:02:57] desire to draw nigh to you. You will
[2:02:59] take care of the rest.
[2:03:02] I say to you, my dear people, this
[2:03:04] morning, listen to this. I've never made
[2:03:06] this up. I'm responsible for telling it.
[2:03:08] That's all I'm responsible for. If I've
[2:03:11] never preached another sermon in my
[2:03:12] life, this is the truth. There is just
[2:03:15] going to be a few people saved.
[2:03:18] Just remember that. Just a very few.
[2:03:21] You'll be one of them. This is not a
[2:03:22] very good message for for a preacher to
[2:03:25] preach or to say like that to to the
[2:03:27] bride of Jesus Christ. But I know you
[2:03:30] understand what I mean, right? I'm not
[2:03:32] trying to put fear on it, but I'm just
[2:03:34] trying to shake us a little bit. Say,
[2:03:36] Lord, I want to be part of those few. I
[2:03:40] know I'm part of those few but let my
[2:03:42] works show that I'm part of those few.
[2:03:45] So who are they? Brother Branam say I
[2:03:47] don't know. Nobody else knows. We work
[2:03:50] out our own salvation with fear and
[2:03:52] trembling.
[2:03:54] Brother Bam doesn't know. I don't know.
[2:03:56] Even yourself you don't know except your
[2:03:59] own faith.
[2:04:01] But says but you work out our own
[2:04:03] salvation with fear and trembling. But
[2:04:05] you be lined up with God. If your heart
[2:04:07] don't beat just with the Bible, then
[2:04:10] there is something wrong. There is
[2:04:11] something wrong. No matter what your
[2:04:13] church says, you can't go in by that.
[2:04:16] You go, you got to go in by what God
[2:04:19] said. This is the book. You'll be judged
[2:04:21] from the Bible. Stay with it. If you
[2:04:24] say, "Well, I've been baptized in the
[2:04:25] name of the Lord Jesus Christ." That's
[2:04:26] correct. That's the Bible. But if that
[2:04:28] life doesn't follow it, it doesn't do
[2:04:31] much good to be baptized.
[2:04:34] You say, "Well, I've received the Holy
[2:04:36] Ghost." That's good. But what you should
[2:04:39] have done, but if the life isn't there,
[2:04:42] then you'll continue. In other words,
[2:04:46] life is the one that distinguishes.
[2:04:50] And the life we make all mistakes all
[2:04:52] the time, but my life, Lord, is my
[2:04:55] desire, Lord. My desire is to draw nigh
[2:04:57] to you. My desire is to get closer to
[2:05:00] the word of God. Draw me near to the
[2:05:02] word of God. I will do my part. I will
[2:05:04] be determined as the first song was. I
[2:05:07] am determined to draw nigh to you, Lord.
[2:05:10] In this new year, I am determined to
[2:05:12] draw nigh to you, Lord.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; The same message says straight is again.
[2:05:22] Now remember, the weeds receive the same
[2:05:23] power that falls on the wheat to make it
[2:05:25] grow. Makes the wheat shout. The little
[2:05:28] old weed stand out and just as happy as
[2:05:30] the wheat is. That's right. lives by the
[2:05:32] same life and a sinner can stay in the
[2:05:35] presence of God shout the victory live
[2:05:37] like a Christian but if there isn't
[2:05:39] something different in the heart you
[2:05:41] could have the same power to cast out
[2:05:42] evil spirit Jesus said so he can preach
[2:05:45] the gospel just as good as any other
[2:05:47] preacher can do that exactly what Jesus
[2:05:49] said so the Bible teaches it yes sir
[2:05:51] though I speak with tongues with man and
[2:05:53] of angel though I give my body to be
[2:05:55] burned as a sacrifice I give all my
[2:05:57] goods to fill the poor I have faith to
[2:05:59] move mountains I do all these things I
[2:06:01] preach in his name. I cast out devils in
[2:06:03] the name. He said I'm nothing. [snorts]
[2:06:05] But this message is not only for the
[2:06:07] it's also for the preacher. It's also
[2:06:08] for me. Amen.
[2:06:11] With I have not more mountains do not. I
[2:06:13] preach in his name. I cast devils. He
[2:06:14] said I'm nothing. If I could do it and
[2:06:17] nothing. Get the idea. The thing to do
[2:06:19] is from your heart be a Christian. Now
[2:06:21] enter in that straight gate. Broad is
[2:06:23] the way that leads to destruction.
[2:06:25] million times, millions of this
[2:06:26] generation of believers will go in their
[2:06:29] because straight the gate narrow is the
[2:06:31] way just you and Christ alone.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you don't want any trouble
[2:06:39] at the river.
[2:06:41] You don't want to come to the river say
[2:06:43] no but yeah I believed it but I didn't
[2:06:45] do it. So why that's what's called
[2:06:49] iniquity. No, you knew better. Then you
[2:06:52] should do because you knew better. Some
[2:06:55] people don't know, but you knew better.
[2:06:58] Lord, I don't want any trouble at the
[2:07:00] river.
[2:07:05] Abraham and his seed. He says, [snorts]
[2:07:07] "So God doesn't run his business. If he
[2:07:10] saved us here and know that he was going
[2:07:12] to lose us after a while, poor
[2:07:14] businessman. So therefore all that he
[2:07:17] forneew he he was he has called. All
[2:07:19] that he has called he has justified. All
[2:07:21] that he has justified he has already
[2:07:23] glorified. Now there is going to be a
[2:07:25] church meet him there without spot and
[2:07:27] wrinkle. Brother Banam you in it? Are
[2:07:30] you in it? Says I hope so. Says yeah I
[2:07:33] hope so. But we work out our own
[2:07:35] salvation with fear and trembling. That
[2:07:38] fear is doesn't mean that you are scared
[2:07:40] and everything. No [snorts] it's not.
[2:07:43] It's just respectful. I'm I'm
[2:07:45] respectful. I'm I'm sincere as it was
[2:07:48] called to prophet be sincere. Be more
[2:07:50] sincere. Says when because we don't want
[2:07:53] to do things by traditions you know I
[2:07:55] just come to church and I know there'll
[2:07:56] be two trees of songs with and then that
[2:07:59] this and that. This is you can memorize
[2:08:01] become just traditions. Ah no but I
[2:08:03] don't I don't want to be more sincere
[2:08:05] lord. As I come I want to meet you. I
[2:08:07] want to have a fellowship with you.
[2:08:09] Speak to my heart lord. Correct me.
[2:08:12] Change me father. If there's anything I
[2:08:13] need to improve, help me to improve.
[2:08:15] Father, you speak even be way beyond the
[2:08:18] words of the preacher because the Holy
[2:08:20] Spirit can convince me of something.
[2:08:21] Father, I want to be I want to be the
[2:08:24] masterpiece. I want to be corrected.
[2:08:26] Shape me, mold me, Father. I don't want
[2:08:29] I I don't want me to fit I I I don't I
[2:08:32] don't want the garment to fit my
[2:08:33] conditions, but I want me to fit your
[2:08:36] garment, Lord. So, shape me. Take
[2:08:38] anything that is not of yours, Lord. I
[2:08:40] want to be REFLECTING YOU, LORD. HELP
[2:08:42] ME, FATHER. Help me to be more sincere,
[2:08:44] Lord.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; Brother, are you in it? No. I hope so.
[2:08:52] But we work out our own salvation, fear,
[2:08:54] and tremblies. When you see your life
[2:08:55] not coping up with God's word, and no
[2:08:57] matter what church you belong, you know
[2:09:00] you're out of order. If you do your
[2:09:02] religion because you know it's something
[2:09:05] that you are supposed to do, you're just
[2:09:07] playing the part of hypocrite. It
[2:09:09] [snorts] isn't from your heart that you
[2:09:11] love God that then you are wrong to
[2:09:14] start with. You love it's love that
[2:09:16] controls the whole thing. Love of God.
[2:09:20] [snorts]
[2:09:21] As the prophet will many places I love
[2:09:23] my wife so well but I don't want to do
[2:09:25] anything that will hurt her. If if if
[2:09:28] feel love can bring me to live that way.
[2:09:31] How much more agapa love? It's not like
[2:09:33] I'm going to be lost but I just love him
[2:09:36] so much. It's not by fear. prophet will
[2:09:38] go even deeper. So even if he sends me
[2:09:41] to hell, I will still love him. I will
[2:09:43] not regret serving God. I will not
[2:09:46] regret coming to church. I will not
[2:09:47] regret him praying. I'll still love him
[2:09:50] even in that conditions. If there is
[2:09:52] something called love over there, I'LL
[2:09:54] STILL LOVE HIM. THAT'S WHERE THE
[2:09:56] CHRISTIAN LIFE HAS TO BE. LORD, I LOVE
[2:09:58] YOU SO MUCH. NOT TO PLEASE SOMEONE, not
[2:10:01] to please the pastor, NOT TO PLEASE. NO,
[2:10:02] I WANT TO SERVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART.
[2:10:05] THIS YEAR I WANT TO DRAW NIGHT TO YOU
[2:10:07] LORD. WE LOVING YOU MORE THAN ANYTHING.
[2:10:10] NOT A LIP SERVICE BUT FROM OUR HEART
[2:10:12] LORD. AND AND IT SHOWS. IT'S PUBLIC.
[2:10:14] IT'S KNOWN. I'M NOT I'M I'M NOT ASHAMED
[2:10:17] TO SHOW IT. I LOVE YOU LORD.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; Another message trying to do God without
[2:10:32] it being God's will. After the seals
[2:10:36] says when I use predestinated I don't
[2:10:38] think that the the only word I know to
[2:10:41] make it's God's fornowledge. See if he
[2:10:44] know he can't he died that all might be
[2:10:46] saved. He did but for by his for
[2:10:49] knowledge he know who would and would
[2:10:51] not that what he knows I don't know it
[2:10:54] you don't know it
[2:10:58] changes
[2:10:59] so yeah but you don't know it you you
[2:11:02] just say it a confession yes but you
[2:11:05] don't know it for certainty
[2:11:08] so I don't know it you don't know it so
[2:11:11] we work out our own salvation with fear
[2:11:13] and trembling now but God has his word
[2:11:17] set and he said it in the old ages is
[2:11:20] for knowledge has caused him to set in
[2:11:22] the church in the people certain things
[2:11:24] that he did from the beginning then the
[2:11:26] gospel that's being preached to that age
[2:11:28] is only revealed to that certain people
[2:11:31] the rest of them don't see it that
[2:11:33] certain people is you and me others
[2:11:36] don't receive it have the ability to
[2:11:38] receive it but you and me by God's grace
[2:11:40] we have received it thank God for
[2:11:43] putting that ability in our heart to
[2:11:45] receive the word of God.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; But now I will live
[2:11:51] as if my salvation depended on my works
[2:11:54] knowing that it doesn't save me. But the
[2:11:57] way I live, I live as if it's depending
[2:12:01] on my works.
[2:12:03] little preach to justification I think
[2:12:05] is the one who said if it's not him the
[2:12:07] other the other the other pastor in
[2:12:10] England says when I look at myself I
[2:12:13] don't see how I can be saved but when I
[2:12:15] look at Christ
[2:12:17] I don't see how I can be lost
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; because it's all about Christ
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; amen
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; when you look at Christ I don't see how
[2:12:27] I can be lost
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; because he paid it all for me
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; thank God for his grace Yes.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; Is it okay? Give me a few minutes. I'll
[2:12:40] be closing here. I just want to put a a
[2:12:43] paragraph, a parallel to Caleb here.
[2:12:49] Caleb said the type of the true believer
[2:12:51] Joshua to the Joshua is the type of the
[2:12:53] Holy Ghost. Despite this giant giant, we
[2:12:56] are more than a conqueror to possess the
[2:12:58] land. We are not retracting. We will
[2:13:00] keep moving forward. His attitude of
[2:13:04] Caleb did not change.
[2:13:07] The attitude of Kalb was the same before
[2:13:09] crossing Jordan. It was the same after
[2:13:11] crossing Jordan. If we can't put it in
[2:13:14] time today is not only is not you you
[2:13:17] are not you are not working you are not
[2:13:19] you are not you are not serving God only
[2:13:21] until you get the Holy Ghost and then
[2:13:23] you rest and says no I'm in the canon
[2:13:25] and everything is no Caleb before we
[2:13:29] crossing Jordan. So no this giant they
[2:13:32] cannot stop me they CANNOT STOP US
[2:13:34] ACCORDING TO GOD'S WORD BY GOD'S GRACE
[2:13:36] WE ARE MORE THAN OVERCOMER WE CAN
[2:13:38] OVERCOME THIS LAND WE ARE GOING TO
[2:13:40] OVERCOME THIS LAND IT'S OUR POSSESSION
[2:13:43] IT'S OUR LAND THAT GOD LOOK AT THAT
[2:13:45] ATTITUDE SAYS I LOVE THE spirit of Caleb
[2:13:48] it's a different spirit than other
[2:13:51] spirit of the other one they're
[2:13:52] complaining murmuring they can't think
[2:13:54] that they can't DO IT BUT CALEB SAYS I
[2:13:56] KNOW BY GOD'S GRACE IT'S GOD'S PROMISE
[2:13:58] WE WILL DO IT AMEN THAT THE ATTITUDE OF
[2:14:01] THE BRIDE IN THIS AGE BY GOD'S GRACE BY
[2:14:03] GOD'S GRACE BY GOD'S GRACE BY THE
[2:14:06] ANOINTING OF THE EAGLE WE HAVE RECEIVED
[2:14:08] WE ARE MORE THAN OVERCOMERS OF LEODYSIA
[2:14:11] NO MATTER THE CONDITION OF THE ODYSIA
[2:14:13] THIS WORD OF GOD WILL MEET EVERY
[2:14:15] CIRCUMSTANCE EVERY SITUATIONS it is IS
[2:14:18] THE WORD OF GOD THAT MEET THE END TIME
[2:14:20] CONDITIONS AMEN THANK [screaming] GOD
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE WAS BAPTIZED in the type of
[2:14:25] the holy ghost coming into the land of
[2:14:27] the holy ghost in THE PROMISED LAND OF
[2:14:29] THE HOLY BECAUSE HIS ATTITUDE STAY THE
[2:14:31] SAME. AMEN. WHEN HE WAS CLAIMING FOR HIS
[2:14:33] MOUNTAIN SAYS, "NO, I'M STILL STRONG AS
[2:14:35] I WAS BACK THEN. IT'S NOT MY AGE THAT
[2:14:39] HAS CHANGED ANYTHING. I'M STILL
[2:14:40] CONFESSING THE WORD OF GOD. GIVE ME MY
[2:14:43] MOUNTAIN. I'M STANDING FOR MY MOUNTAIN.
[2:14:45] I WILL FIGHT FOR MY ANOINTING. I WILL
[2:14:47] FIGHT FOR MY FAMILY. I WILL FIGHT FOR MY
[2:14:49] INHERITANCE. I WILL FIGHT FOR THE WORD
[2:14:51] OF GOD. I WILL DRAW NIGH TO GOD." AMEN.
[2:14:54] THAT'S THE ATTITUDE OF THE BRIDE. AMEN.
[2:14:56] ARE YOU WITH ME THIS MORNING? LORD,
[2:14:58] [screaming] I WANT TO PRESS ON WITH YOU.
[2:15:00] LORD, I WANT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH YOU
[2:15:02] BECAUSE IT'S MY PROMISE.
[2:15:05] Praise be to God.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; Prophet will take that and
[2:15:13] and take that and as an inspiration for
[2:15:15] desperation. He says desperation when
[2:15:18] you seeketh me with all thy heart then
[2:15:20] I'll hear you. The kingdom the law the
[2:15:23] prophets were until John. Since then,
[2:15:25] the kingdom of heaven has been preached
[2:15:27] and men pressed into it. You don't just
[2:15:30] stand around and say, "Pick me up by the
[2:15:32] call of Lord, Lord, and push me in." No,
[2:15:36] you press into it. You get DESPERATE
[2:15:38] BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH. That's another
[2:15:42] time for another story. I thinking right
[2:15:44] talking about that that woman took he
[2:15:48] was praying for her and she was praying
[2:15:49] after she got so desperate and says, "Oh
[2:15:52] God, save me." says the alcoholic and
[2:15:54] animals also cure her. NOTHING COULD
[2:15:56] HAVE DONE IT. BUT THEM BIG BLACK EYES
[2:15:59] looked upon me and she dropping of the
[2:16:01] shi she shy the chips and she says
[2:16:03] something happened. Oh yes sir something
[2:16:05] happened. She got desperate. It says let
[2:16:08] desperate about between life. If you
[2:16:11] don't get desperate we don't go through
[2:16:13] here. But if you're desperate come here
[2:16:15] and watch you'll GET JUST GET HERE. says
[2:16:20] desperation watch the kingdom of God it
[2:16:23] will become the kingdom of God presence
[2:16:26] you have forces I like the first you
[2:16:29] have to have taken by force you have to
[2:16:32] be like you like depend on you depending
[2:16:37] on you oh
[2:16:40] you
[2:16:42] fighting for it as depending on your own
[2:16:47] I pray. [snorts]
[2:16:50] I'm tired, but I haven't pray.
[2:16:55] I'm tired, but I have to go to church.
[2:16:58] I'm glad
[2:17:00] we go to church. Amen.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; Does it give you salvation? No. You
[2:17:05] continue living
[2:17:08] because you love us so much. No, I'm
[2:17:10] tired. It's not
[2:17:14] I was suffering. No, no, no, no.
[2:17:21] I'm talking to myself. I hate myself
[2:17:23] when I think that way. I'm like, what
[2:17:26] are what kind of believers are you just
[2:17:28] going to go into rapture and I just be
[2:17:30] lazy and
[2:17:32] I don't want to be that kind of
[2:17:33] preacher? No, no, no. I don't want to be
[2:17:35] that. No, I don't want to be that. I
[2:17:37] hate when I think that way.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; I hate when I think that way. No, no,
[2:17:43] no. But
[2:17:46] finding excuse. I can find excuse for
[2:17:48] everything.
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; If you go with excuse, you could find
[2:17:51] excuses for everything.
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; But no,
[2:17:56] sometimes I have to pull myself to go to
[2:17:58] work. The roads are bad, but I still go
[2:18:00] to work. No, this is my if I don't, hey,
[2:18:02] who's going to pay this mortgage?
[2:18:04] Let's pull myself in.
[2:18:07] But when it come to church, you know
[2:18:09] that brother Andrew is there know he'll
[2:18:11] take care of that.
[2:18:16] And you go the same rapture as brother
[2:18:17] Andrew
[2:18:19] and then
[2:18:22] God help us. Amen.
[2:18:33] Is it okay? I think I can close there. I
[2:18:37] hope it's fine. This new Lord, I just I
[2:18:39] just want to be to draw n to you.
[2:18:41] Musicians can come. I put I put the
[2:18:45] nails where I have to put. But Lord,
[2:18:47] help me to draw nigh unto you, Lord.
[2:18:50] That's my desire.
[2:18:52] As I draw nigh unto you, you'll draw
[2:18:53] nigh unto me. That's your promise.
[2:19:07] But we have do doing do those things all
[2:19:09] through our life. We have been faithful.
[2:19:10] We have been loving the Lord. We have
[2:19:12] been doing our best. That's true. We
[2:19:14] have been doing our best, brothers and
[2:19:16] sisters. It's not to condemn any person.
[2:19:19] But I think there's still room to do
[2:19:21] better. There's still room to improve.
[2:19:24] Otherwise, if there was no room to
[2:19:26] improve, we would not be alive today.
[2:19:30] The fact that we are still alive, God's
[2:19:32] shows that we still have [music] a role
[2:19:35] to play, something to do, or maybe
[2:19:38] something to improve on. Lord, help me
[2:19:40] to grow with you until I reach
[2:19:43] perfection,
[2:19:45] maturity as you want. Father,
[2:19:47] Philippians 4 says, "Rejoice in the Lord
[2:19:49] always, and again I say, rejoice. Let
[2:19:51] your moderation be known unto all men.
[2:19:54] The Lord is at hand. Be careful for for
[2:19:57] [music] nothing, but in everything by
[2:19:59] prayer and supplications with
[2:20:01] thanksgiving, let your request be known
[2:20:03] unto God. And the peace of God which
[2:20:06] passes all understanding [music] shall
[2:20:08] keep your heart and mind through Jesus
[2:20:10] Christ. Finally, finally, brethren,
[2:20:13] whatsoever things are true, whatsoever
[2:20:15] things are honest, whatsoever things are
[2:20:17] just, whatsoever things are pure,
[2:20:18] whatever things are lovely, whatever
[2:20:20] things are of a good report, if there be
[2:20:23] any virtue, if there be any praise,
[2:20:25] think on these things, these things
[2:20:28] which you have both learned and received
[2:20:30] and heard and seen in me, do [music] and
[2:20:33] the God of peace shall be with you. And
[2:20:36] then verse 13, I can do all things
[2:20:38] through Christ which strengthened me.
[2:20:40] That's the attitude [music]
[2:20:41] Lord prophet in other places say how can
[2:20:44] you draw nigh to God think upon him
[2:20:47] think upon the good things how he saved

[2:27:05] that love that girl or that girl love
[2:27:07] that boy but once they're married
[2:27:10] doesn't love doesn't diminish [music] or

[2:27:15] should get stronger the same way with
[2:27:17] our lord Jesus Christ desire our love
[2:27:20] for him to get stronger stronger [music]
[2:27:22] and to be manifested and how we express
[2:27:24] our love towards him the prophet says as
[2:27:27] we have our our heads Bow says, "I pray
[2:27:31] as God who could only I pray as a man
[2:27:34] could only pray, Lord, these people will
[2:27:37] do anything for me as far as to [music]
[2:27:39] help me. If I was hungry, they would
[2:27:41] feed me. If I need a suit, they'll buy
[2:27:44] it. They'd go together and buy me a car
[2:27:46] to preach the gospel. They do anything
[2:27:48] in that way. Oh, Father, search their
[2:27:51] soul this morning. Please do. Let them
[2:27:54] search it out before you. I don't know.
[2:27:57] I trust that every one of [music] them
[2:27:59] is in that elect and put me there too.
[2:28:02] Lord, if there be any reason in me that
[2:28:04] I wouldn't be there, Lord, you just
[2:28:06] reveal it to me. I'll make it right
[2:28:09] right now. I want to be sure, Lord, that
[2:28:12] on that morning there will be no trouble
[2:28:14] at the river. I want to go in that
[2:28:16] [music] day and I don't know when that
[2:28:20] will be. It may be yet today. So help me
[2:28:23] to know, help these people to know. But
[2:28:25] when we see our heart unconcerned and we
[2:28:29] enjoy good message to listen to the
[2:28:31] radio, go to the church. We appreciate a
[2:28:33] good message. We don't mind speaking of
[2:28:35] Jesus Christ somewhere. But Lord is sin
[2:28:38] so burdens to us and it brings tears to
[2:28:41] our eyes psyching and crying and
[2:28:44] standing against it. Everything the
[2:28:45] abomination that did in the city. Lord
[2:28:48] [clears throat and snorts] let the angel

[2:53:34] sometimes we feel condemned by the word
[2:53:36] of God.
[2:53:41] Father, we desire that yourself may you
