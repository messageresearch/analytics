[13:49] Oh, once my soul
[13:52] was astray
[13:54] from the heavenly
[13:58] way
[13:59] and was wretched
[14:02] and vile
[14:04] as could be.
[14:09] But my Savior
[14:12] above
[14:14] gave me peace, joy, and love when he
[14:19] reached down his hand for me.
[14:27] When he reached down his hand for me.
[14:36] When he reached way down
[14:40] for me,
[14:45] I was lost
[14:47] and undone
[14:49] without God
[14:51] or his son.
[14:54] When he reached down his hand for me,
[15:02] I was fearing
[15:05] despair
[15:06] when he came to me there and he showed
[15:12] me that I could be free.

[16:01] down his hand for me.
[16:07] How my heart does rejoice
[16:11] since I made him my choice. From the
[16:16] tempest
[16:18] to him, now I flee.
[16:23] Now I lean on his arms. I'm secure from
[16:30] a heart since I reach out his hand for
[16:36] me.
[16:39] When he reached down his hand for me.
[16:47] When he reached way down for me.
[16:55] I was lost and undone

[17:05] down his hand for me.
[17:11] Since I'm in gave me peace, heavenly joy
[17:17] never cease. Lord, I give all my life
[17:23] unto thee.
[17:26] Guide my feet, hold my hand. Grant with
[17:31] thee may I stand. For he reached down
[17:37] his hand for me.
[17:42] When he reached down his hand for me.
[17:50] When he reached down his hand for me.
[17:55] [Music]

[18:01] without God or his son.
[18:05] Don't reach down his hand for me.

[34:36] The end is here.
[34:41] It's now at hand.
[34:46] The bride is gathering.
[34:51] The world is failing.
[34:57] Israel's
[34:59] awakening.
[35:02] Nations are breaking.
[35:07] The prophets come and we believe
[35:13] the end is here.
[35:17] Have you considered
[35:23] the end time
[35:26] message?
[35:28] Have you considered
[35:33] Malachi 4,
[35:38] Revelations 10 and 7
[35:43] and Matthew 24
[35:48] proclaims this message loud and clear
[35:54] forever more.
[35:58] The end is here.
[36:03] It's now at hand.
[36:08] The bride is gathering.
[36:13] The world is failing.
[36:19] Israel's awakening.

[36:29] The prophets gone and we believe

[37:00] Luke 17. Amen.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Wonderful. God bless you
[37:04] richly, Sister Wendy. It's good to be in
[37:07] the atmosphere of the Lord this morning.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; And it's special. God bless you richly.
[37:12] God bless you, brother Goshan.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you
[37:15] for blessing us this morning. So good to
[37:18] be in the house of the Lord. Amen.
[37:20] Amen. Just want to give some few
[37:23] announcement here and then sorry for
[37:25] breaking the atmosphere a bit and then
[37:28] uh
[37:30] then we go to the word of god. So I
[37:33] think brother Andre has announced this
[37:35] Wednesday we're thinking to cancel the
[37:37] service it's Wednesday since we'll have
[37:39] a service on on uh on Sunday
[37:44] on Saturday and Sunday. Thank you
[37:47] Saturday and Sunday. so that it can
[37:49] cover that and then probably I'll have
[37:52] another meeting with the young people on
[37:53] Friday just to accelerate a little bit
[37:56] of that to prepare for some special for
[37:58] the Saturday. So um and then on Thursday
[38:01] there is another program um there. So
[38:05] probably have to cancel the Wednesday.
[38:09] So um like to have a little bit of a
[38:11] meeting of young people after the
[38:12] service right after the service here.
[38:15] just a quick uh meeting there and some
[38:18] young people have left the brother go
[38:20] and sing by himself
[38:22] supposed to sing with him but I think
[38:24] it's okay he handled it very well how
[38:27] many were blessed by the song
[38:30] Amen and sister Wendy also uh so we
[38:34] finished one one message of brother
[38:36] Banham the the the paradox there so now
[38:40] um so now we are listening to the
[38:41] message the seed of discrepancy so if we
[38:44] can catch up on that. We're listening on
[38:46] that at the beginning of the service the
[38:49] seed of discrepancy and preached in 19
[38:53] 65. Amen. And uh I've been in contact
[38:57] brother Victor and then planning to come
[38:59] anytime soon and also brother Maui told
[39:03] me that they couldn't make it for today
[39:05] but they are doing fine. So
[39:08] &gt;&gt; just God bless them richly. Amen. And
[39:10] welcome to Pastor William has been
[39:12] welcomed but he's here with his family.
[39:16] Amen.
[39:18] Pastor William from from William from
[39:20] from Spain. He came all the way from
[39:23] Spain, Madrid and the pastor over there
[39:26] the church and uh uh he wanted to spend
[39:30] some time in his vacation as a family in
[39:33] Alberta. I was telling him that's
[39:35] surprising.
[39:37] That's surprising. Many people jump on
[39:40] on on on Vancouver and Montreal and
[39:43] Toronto. Usually they don't come here
[39:45] and and he chose to come here. So we are
[39:48] honored by that. God bless you richly.
[39:50] He came with his wife and the family.
[39:52] God bless them richly. Amen. Amen.
[39:56] We let him say a few words at the end of
[39:58] the service and close us in the service
[40:01] in prayer at the end of the service.
[40:03] Amen.
[40:05] Wonderful. Um let's sing one song and
[40:07] then he abides. He abides and then go to
[40:11] the word of God.

[40:19] &gt;&gt; He abides.
[40:22] He abides.
[40:25] Hallelujah. He abides with me.
[40:31] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[40:35] the narrow way. For the comforter abides
[40:40] with me.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; I'm rejoicing.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; I'm rejoicing night and day. As I walk
[40:48] the pilgrim way for the hand of God in
[40:52] all my life I see.
[40:56] And the reason of my plans
[41:00] all
[41:02] that the comforter abides with me abides

[41:11] &gt;&gt; He abides abides. Hallelujah. He abides
[41:17] with me.
[41:20] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk in
[41:24] narrow way. For the comforter abides
[41:29] with me was my heart. Once my heart was
[41:33] full of sin. Once I had no peace within
[41:38] till I heard how Jesus died upon a tree.
[41:44] And I fell down at his feet and there
[41:47] came a peace so sweet. Now the comforter
[41:52] abides with me. Oh,

[42:20] He is with me everywhere and he knows my
[42:25] every.
[42:26] I'm as happy as a bird and just as free.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; For the spirit has control. Jesus
[42:36] satisfies my soul since the comforter
[42:40] abides with me.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; He abides.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; He abides.
[42:47] He abides.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He abides with me.
[42:56] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[43:00] the narrow way. For the comforter
[43:04] abides, he abides. He abides.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; He abides.
[43:11] He abides.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He abides with me.
[43:20] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[43:24] the narrow way. For the comforter abides
[43:29] with me.
[43:34] Glory to his name. Glory to your name,
[43:37] Lord Jesus Christ. Thank you, Father.
[43:41] Father, we thank you, Lord, this morning
[43:42] to be in your presence, rejoicing,
[43:45] Father, night and day. Father, because
[43:48] the Holy Spirit, the comforter, the
[43:51] enforcer of the word of God abides with
[43:53] us, Lord. Father, we thank you that Lord
[43:56] Jesus Christ, you gave us that promise
[43:58] that you will never leave us. You will
[44:00] never forsake us, but you'll always be
[44:02] with us. The world won't see you, but we
[44:05] will see you because you won't only be
[44:07] with us, but you'll also be inside of
[44:09] us. Father, we thank you for your
[44:12] promise and your faithfulness, Lord
[44:13] Jesus Christ. Now, it's not only the
[44:16] baptism of the Holy Spirit, but in the
[44:18] person of the Holy Ghost himself
[44:20] visiting the bride. We thank you,
[44:22] Father, for that, Lord Jesus Christ,
[44:24] preparing us for the rapture. We thank
[44:26] you Lord Jesus Christ that we are coming
[44:29] no Lord Jesus Christ not in a time of
[44:31] dispensation of the father not of the
[44:33] son but of the holy ghost now within us
[44:35] Lord for the bride to continue the work
[44:38] as we heard last Sunday Lord we love you
[44:41] and appreciate you may you help me
[44:43] father to deliver the word this morning
[44:45] may you bless each individual each each
[44:47] person that came this morning may give
[44:50] them a portion of yourself father that
[44:52] will go back father from the from this
[44:54] place testifying saying it was good to
[44:57] be in the house of the Lord. He spoke to
[44:59] my heart. He met my need. He gave me
[45:02] more faith. Father, that's what we
[45:04] desire. Bless your people, Lord. Bless
[45:06] the visitor among us, Lord, as we commit
[45:09] all the whole service in your hand.
[45:10] Thank you for the specials. Thank you
[45:12] for each leak of of fire this morning,
[45:14] Father, for your glory and your honor.
[45:16] We give you the glory and the honor in
[45:18] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[45:23] Amen.
[45:24] Amen.
[45:26] Amen. We can turn to the word of God.
[45:30] Thank you musicians. Brother Calb and
[45:33] brother Andrew Peter. God bless you
[45:35] richly. Amen.
[45:46] I would like to read in first
[45:48] Thessalonians
[45:49] 3
[45:51] 10.
[46:05] I'll let you sit and I'll read more
[46:06] other scriptures. 1 Thessalonians 3:10.
[46:12] [Music]
[46:16] So Paul speaking said night and day 1
[46:20] Thessalonians 3:10 and day praying
[46:23] exceedingly
[46:24] that we might see your face and might
[46:27] perfect that which is lacking in your
[46:30] faith. May God bless his word. Amen.
[46:34] That's his desire that he might perfect
[46:37] that which is lacking in your faith.
[46:40] Amen. God bless his word. And you can
[46:43] have your seat. Amen.
[46:53] As we continue our study regarding the
[46:55] statue of the perfect man, give it a
[46:58] title, the statue of
[47:01] of the fullness of Christ. And this
[47:03] morning I would like just to touch a
[47:04] little bit on the the just introduction
[47:09] maybe the perfect faith or the faith of
[47:12] the change of the body. Amen. Faith of
[47:16] the change of the body. Amen. Ephesians
[47:19] 4:11 says, "And he gave some apostles
[47:22] and some prophets and some evangelists
[47:25] and some pastors and teachers for the
[47:28] perfecting of the saints for the work of
[47:31] the ministry for the edifying of the
[47:34] body of Christ. So all the five-fold
[47:37] ministry including the prophet messenger
[47:39] have only one purpose is to edify the
[47:43] body of Christ and to perfect them to
[47:46] perfect the saints to come to the full
[47:48] maturity. Perfecting of the saints. I
[47:51] like that word because you're already
[47:53] sanctified but doesn't mean once you are
[47:55] sanctified doesn't mean you have come to
[47:56] the full maturity. Can be sanctified.
[47:59] You can be a saint but you still come
[48:01] you need to come still to the full
[48:03] maturity of the statue of a perfect man.
[48:06] Amen. Is that your desire this morning?
[48:08] Amen. To come to the statue of the
[48:10] perfect man. And coming to the statue of
[48:12] a perfect man does not mean that you
[48:14] don't don't make mistakes. We said many
[48:16] times means you can make mistakes but
[48:19] you have come to the full maturity. You
[48:21] are grown up Christians. You are ragged
[48:23] Christians. You know where you are. The
[48:25] circumstances don't disturb you. You're
[48:28] not tossed to to and fro. You're not
[48:30] tossed about. You know where you are
[48:32] standing. Amen. You continue your walk.
[48:34] You continue you know your position. You
[48:36] know your place. You continue praising
[48:38] the Lord no matter the circumstances.
[48:41] You are don't have the mentality of a of
[48:43] a of a victim of circumstances and
[48:46] complaining and murmuring. No, you know
[48:48] that God is in control of every
[48:50] situation. And what I would like to
[48:52] emphasize a little bit this morning is
[48:53] to become have a faith, you have to
[48:55] become the master of circumstances.
[48:57] Amen.
[48:59] Till we all come, the Bible continues,
[49:01] till we all come in the unity of the
[49:03] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[49:05] God, unto a perfect man unto the measure
[49:09] of the statue of the fullness of Christ,
[49:12] that we henceforth be no more children,
[49:16] tossed to and fro, and carried about
[49:18] with every wind of doctrine. Every time
[49:20] you hear everything that comes, well,
[49:22] it's in you, then you run rush to it and
[49:24] and then you forget the best and all the
[49:26] things. That's not that's not a mature
[49:28] Christians. Sometimes you run here and
[49:31] there run here and there. You want to
[49:32] learn and to find out new things. That's
[49:35] not necessarily a sign of a mature
[49:37] Christians. Amen. You have received the
[49:40] word of God. You have received the
[49:42] message of the hour. You have received
[49:44] the absolute. You just stay with the
[49:46] absolute. There's nothing that can be
[49:48] added on top of what we have already
[49:50] received. Is the last message for the
[49:53] gentile age. Amen. There is no other
[49:56] message that can be added on top of what
[49:58] we have received. It is the perfection
[50:01] of what wanting the bride to receive for
[50:04] the body change. The message of the hour
[50:06] is the only place you can have the
[50:09] vitamins to change this body to receive
[50:12] the incorruptible body of of of a
[50:14] glorified body. Amen. That's the only
[50:16] message that has the ingredients to
[50:19] change our body. Amen.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. says you are not a child and
[50:24] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[50:26] every wind of doctrine but it's light of
[50:29] man or slit of man or cunning craftness
[50:32] whereby they lie in way to deceive but
[50:35] speaking the truth in love
[50:39] speaking the truth in love. Amen. can
[50:41] have the truth, but you have to speak it
[50:43] in love, may grow up into him in all
[50:46] things, which is the head, even Christ,
[50:49] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[50:52] together, and and and and compacted by
[50:55] that which every joint supplieth
[50:57] according to the effectual working uh in
[51:00] the measure of every part, maketh
[51:03] increase of the body, unto the edifying
[51:06] of itself in love. So many things can be
[51:09] said there but just mean to me means
[51:11] that a mature Christians knows that he
[51:15] has a role in the body of Christ.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; A mature Christian whether he feels it
[51:19] whether people appreciate him or not he
[51:22] knows that he has a place in the body of
[51:25] Christ. He continues serving the Lord
[51:27] because if he's not at his place the
[51:30] body cannot increase the body cannot be
[51:33] edified. So he continue to serve the
[51:35] Lord. He continue to praise the Lord. He
[51:37] continued to be obedient to the word of
[51:39] God. He continued to be faithful in the
[51:42] small things or the big things or the
[51:44] big things or a position that people can
[51:46] see or people like position people can't
[51:48] see. He continue to serve the Lord
[51:50] because he knows that is a joint and if
[51:53] he's not there, it won't supply to
[51:55] another person. That's what a mature
[51:57] Christian is. Amen. God, make me more
[51:59] mature, Lord. Make me more mature just
[52:02] to be faithful serving you knowing that
[52:04] I am at my place of position. Amen.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Place of adoption. Amen.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; So um that that's what we went through
[52:13] that and I just come to uncover that a
[52:15] little bit more. And I would like to
[52:17] read as well in Romans 4:13. What shall
[52:20] we say then that Abraham our fathers
[52:22] pertaining to the flesh had found? For
[52:25] if Abraham was justified by works, he
[52:28] had wherefore to glory, but not
[52:31] wherefore be but not before God. For
[52:34] what save the scripture the scripture?
[52:36] Abraham believed God and it was counted
[52:39] unto him for righteousness. Therefore it
[52:42] is of faith that might be by grace to
[52:45] the end the promise might be sure to all
[52:48] the seed not to that only which is of
[52:51] the law but to that also which is of the
[52:54] faith of Abraham who is the father of us
[52:57] all. Amen. The faith of Abraham. The
[53:00] faith of Abra was not actually the faith
[53:02] of Abraham. Recognize the faith of
[53:04] Abraham but it was the faith of God in
[53:07] Abraham. Amen.
[53:09] That is the part I would like to
[53:10] emphasize a little bit more this morning
[53:12] and then to take that as well with James
[53:15] 2
[53:16] 14:26 and a little bit of a scripture
[53:19] that I'm reading here at the beginning
[53:20] just to put a a foundation from where we
[53:23] be going. The Bible says, "What does it
[53:25] profit my brethren? Though a man say he
[53:28] had faith and had not has not works, can
[53:32] faith save him? Says, and James being he
[53:36] has the anointing of a pastor, the
[53:37] anointing of a of of a of of a nox is
[53:41] the is the care burden the care the care
[53:44] the the the burden carer. Then he says,
[53:47] "If a brother or sister be naked and
[53:49] destitute of daily food, and one of you
[53:52] say unto him, depart in peace and be he
[53:54] warmed and and filled notwithstanding he
[53:58] give them not those things which are
[54:00] needful to the body, what does he
[54:02] profit?" In other words, you know, see
[54:04] someone in needs and you just say, "No,
[54:06] God bless you. God take care of you."
[54:09] When you have something that can help
[54:11] him and he says, "What what is what is
[54:13] that really useful?" And we know that
[54:15] God blesses everybody. But if why not
[54:18] you help him in the in the physical need
[54:21] that needs there and we just bless him
[54:23] in general and sometimes we hide behind
[54:26] that blessing. But you need God help us
[54:28] to see the needs. Help us to see what
[54:30] what I can do for my brother, what I can
[54:32] do for my sister. Amen.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Says of a brother being that's what I
[54:39] read. He says um even so faith if he had
[54:43] no works is dead being alone. Yeah. Man
[54:47] may say that has faith and I have and I
[54:49] have works. Show me thy faith without
[54:52] thy works and I will show thee my faith
[54:54] by my works. Say thou believest that
[54:56] there is one God that doest well. The
[54:59] devil also believe. The devil is
[55:02] actually believe. He has a portion of he
[55:04] has a portion of faith. The devil has a
[55:07] portion of faith. He knows that God
[55:08] exists. He knows that no if God says
[55:10] something, God is going to fulfill it.
[55:12] So he tried to break it. So he has a a
[55:15] little level of faith. That's what the
[55:17] Bible says. The devil also believe.
[55:19] Amen.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; But when he believes, he trembles
[55:22] because he knows that the word is always
[55:24] against him. Amen. He cannot have
[55:26] confidence in the word of God. He
[55:28] trembles. Is not for his benefit. The
[55:30] word is for the bride. The word is for
[55:32] the Christians. when we have to believe
[55:35] and not tremble, believe and have faith
[55:38] in God. But willil thou know, oh vain
[55:40] man, that faith without works is dead?
[55:43] Was not Abraham our father, justified by
[55:46] works, when he had offered Isaac his son
[55:49] upon the altar? See that how faith
[55:51] wrought with with his works? By works
[55:55] was faith made perfect. And it's
[55:58] wonderful how he says by works was faith
[56:00] made perfect. So we have faith but if
[56:03] there is no works that faith cannot be
[56:06] perfect. That faith cannot come to the
[56:08] completion. That faith cannot become
[56:10] mature. For it to become mature. It has
[56:12] to be followed by the works. Amen. What
[56:15] you believe you have to act upon what we
[56:18] believe. You accept the word of God. You
[56:20] believe the word of God. Then you have
[56:22] to act upon the word of God. Are you
[56:24] with me this morning?
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; I don't want to lose you. I have not yet
[56:27] studied. So I don't want to lose you at
[56:28] the beginning. The scripture was
[56:30] fulfilled which said Abraham believed
[56:33] God and was imputed unto him for
[56:35] righteousness and he was called the
[56:37] friend of God. You see then how that by
[56:40] works a man is justified and not by
[56:43] faith only by faith only. Likewise also
[56:47] was not Rahab the hall justified by
[56:49] works when she had received the
[56:52] messenger and has sent them on out
[56:54] another way. For as the body without the
[56:58] spirit is dead, so faith without works
[57:01] is dead also.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Oh God, may you give us faith with
[57:05] works. May you help us to live what the
[57:08] word of God says. Amen. So looking at
[57:11] this and the faith of the body of the
[57:13] body change. Just want to look at the
[57:15] life of Abraham for a little bit for a
[57:17] moment as a base as as a foundation.
[57:20] Abraham was just a simple man. Abraham
[57:23] was just a normal person. And were not a
[57:25] super super super super man. He was just
[57:28] a simple man. He was actually he was
[57:31] actually in a worse situation than some
[57:33] of us. He was an idoltor. It was someone
[57:35] was not worshiping the true God. He was
[57:37] an idoltor. The prophet will say it was
[57:39] just really someone simple but there was
[57:42] something specially about him that God
[57:44] had chosen him. God had called him.
[57:47] Amen. The same way that God calls you.
[57:50] The same way that God called me. That
[57:52] how he called Abraham. And Abraham was
[57:54] not nothing special than what you and I
[57:57] we are. But Abraham is something special
[58:00] in before God because he had the seed of
[58:02] God inside of him. Abraham had the faith
[58:06] of God. God put his faith into Abraham.
[58:09] Amen. And that faith of Abraham had to
[58:12] come to the full maturity. Amen. If
[58:14] brother Bame has one character has
[58:16] spoken about a lot in the Bible in his
[58:18] messages is about Abraham. Abraham is
[58:21] the father of faith. that Abraham was a
[58:23] type for brother Bam himself for his
[58:25] ministry. But I believe it also spoke
[58:28] about it because Abraham is also a type.
[58:31] We can identify ourself to the life of
[58:34] Abraham. We can see ourself in the life
[58:37] of Abraham. Abraham makes mistake made
[58:39] mistakes. We also make mistakes. But
[58:42] inside of him, he continued to believe
[58:44] the word of God. Amen. He continued to
[58:47] trust in God. And God, you see in the
[58:49] life of Abraham, many of the situation,
[58:52] Abraham himself put himself in a
[58:53] situation where he couldn't get out of
[58:55] it. Amen. God had to intervene to get
[58:58] him out of that situation. How many
[59:00] times we are in a situation, we don't
[59:02] know how to get out of it. God had to
[59:04] intervene to get out of it. Amen.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Imagine that your wife is with the king
[59:09] and and and and yet the king has to
[59:11] marry your wife. Imagine. Imagine. And
[59:14] in that that night I I can imagine
[59:16] Abraham was probably not sleeping
[59:18] tossing here and there. What have I
[59:21] done? What mistake have I done? What?
[59:23] But God had to intervene and talk to to
[59:26] the king. You know you you are more than
[59:28] dead. You are just a dead man because
[59:30] you have the wife of my prophet.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; But he was I'm a man of integrity. I
[59:35] know you're a man of integrity. I know
[59:37] that my prophet lied to you. But still
[59:39] you have to return his wife because if
[59:42] you don't return wife you are dead and
[59:45] not my prophet. Go to him and he's the
[59:48] one who's going to pray for you.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? God's grace. Amen.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Where would we be without God's grace in
[59:55] our life? You are in backsliden
[59:58] condition and God take you from that and
[1:00:00] amen and put you in higher position.
[1:00:02] Amen. Thank God for his grace in our
[1:00:04] life.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:00:09] Certainly Abraham was affected by
[1:00:11] external by external circumstances.
[1:00:14] He was faced with circumstances. He
[1:00:17] could either consider himself as victim
[1:00:20] or himself consider as master of those
[1:00:22] circumstances. But Abraham I believe in
[1:00:25] all situation he was considering what
[1:00:27] the word of God was saying. When Paul
[1:00:30] had to give a rec record of what or what
[1:00:32] what the life of Abraham was, he looked
[1:00:35] at the faith that was inside of him. It
[1:00:38] was by faith that he was justified
[1:00:40] because God looked at the faith and man
[1:00:43] look at what he did. Amen. When we look
[1:00:45] at what Abra Abra Abraham did, we can
[1:00:48] see so many mistakes like I've mentioned
[1:00:50] because we are man. Amen. But God was
[1:00:52] not looking at those mistakes. God was
[1:00:54] looking at the faith inside of Abraham.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:58] I just wanted to put a little bit here.
[1:01:02] We have very familiar with that that
[1:01:04] that but it's just good to sometimes to
[1:01:07] put it and then we see where we are
[1:01:09] standing and become more visual.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; I try to put this way if I can.
[1:01:19] It's not very stable this thing.
[1:01:22] Hopefully it doesn't fall on me.
[1:01:25] So brother Bam will say a human beings
[1:01:30] is made of
[1:01:32] three part. Amen.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; We have the soul,
[1:01:38] we have the spirit
[1:01:42] and we have the body.
[1:01:46] Every human being has those things.
[1:01:48] Every human being you see have those
[1:01:50] three part. And we have the soul and we
[1:01:53] have the spirit and we have the body.
[1:01:54] And what we see each other here we see
[1:01:56] the body that's what we know that oh
[1:01:58] that's brother Moses that's sister
[1:02:00] Sharifa that's mama Mati and brother Zik
[1:02:03] and all different why because we look at
[1:02:05] the body that's what you see that the
[1:02:07] person but that's actually not the real
[1:02:08] you that's just the coat that you are
[1:02:11] wearing that's just said the envelope
[1:02:14] that the real you is actually inside
[1:02:16] here the soul is the real you amen
[1:02:20] that's where God want to focus is the
[1:02:22] soul inside here amen
[1:02:24] And the the the place of battle is
[1:02:27] actually here in the spirit
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; here.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; That's the mind. That's where we have so
[1:02:32] many battles. Many things that we go
[1:02:35] through the battles happen here. That's
[1:02:38] where he is. So if we manage to conquer
[1:02:41] this place, I can guarantee you if we
[1:02:43] manage to conquer this place, you will
[1:02:45] become a person who will become a master
[1:02:48] of circumstances. But if you are still
[1:02:50] here struggling here, you are will
[1:02:53] consider many things as victims. Amen.
[1:02:55] Because you'll see my body is aching and
[1:02:57] it comes here and the the word of God
[1:03:00] might be from the soul here telling you
[1:03:01] know what you are healed. But here
[1:03:03] you'll see the the body failing and you
[1:03:05] come here say no I'm not healed. You you
[1:03:07] you are seeing you you the mind is the
[1:03:10] battle. The mind is constantly a battle.
[1:03:12] You are thinking negative things. you
[1:03:14] all the different things comes in the
[1:03:16] mind here. And unfortunately the mind is
[1:03:19] the gates to the soul as well.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Things that we see, things that we
[1:03:24] read, the things that we hear, things
[1:03:26] sometimes we smell and touch and
[1:03:27] everything they affect the mind. And if
[1:03:29] we allow it to go to the soul, it
[1:03:31] produces either faith or it produces
[1:03:34] doubt. Amen.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; The only one sense here is faith or
[1:03:38] doubt. But let's talk about the believer
[1:03:40] a little bit. The believer here in the
[1:03:43] soul there is a place where God put the
[1:03:46] seed.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; There is a place where God put a seed.
[1:03:50] This this body can be so doing so many
[1:03:54] things. So negative things as you walk
[1:03:56] in your life as you grow up so many
[1:03:59] things. Your mind has been corrupted by
[1:04:01] so many things. But as long as you have
[1:04:04] the seed of God inside of you here, you
[1:04:07] can never be lost. God can never lose
[1:04:10] you because that small sea that God put
[1:04:13] inside of there is actually God himself
[1:04:16] and God can never perish and you can
[1:04:19] never perish as God can never perish
[1:04:22] because that's the most important part
[1:04:24] inside of you is actually that part.
[1:04:27] Amen. And that's the part that gets
[1:04:29] quickened by the word of God.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; You know you can be you you you hear it.
[1:04:34] You might be in a situation you might be
[1:04:36] in church. You might be in the car. You
[1:04:38] might whatever you might be, you hear
[1:04:39] the word of God and go through your
[1:04:41] mind. But if it comes to the soul and
[1:04:43] quickens that seed, you recognize who
[1:04:46] you are. Oh, I'm not a chicken anymore.
[1:04:49] I have always been an eagle. Amen. I've
[1:04:52] always been a son or a daughter of God.
[1:04:54] Because there was a representation of
[1:04:56] God himself inside there. Amen. That's
[1:04:59] what Abraham was. He was in different
[1:05:01] places and he didn't know who he was.
[1:05:03] But God had put a seed in a
[1:05:05] representation of himself in Abraham.
[1:05:08] That's what Abraham recognized. When God
[1:05:11] spoke to him, he just left that place.
[1:05:13] Amen.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Because of that small thing there.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the representation in our
[1:05:19] life.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; So the proverb say it was not faith in
[1:05:26] God but it was his own faith that he had
[1:05:30] given to the believers. As Romans 12:3
[1:05:33] says, according as God has died to every
[1:05:35] man, according to the verse, the man our
[1:05:38] brethren says the measure of faith.
[1:05:40] Ephesians 2:8, by grace are ye saved
[1:05:42] through faith and by faith, not of
[1:05:45] yourself. It is the gift of God. It is
[1:05:48] also says in James 2, my brethren,
[1:05:51] notice the prophet says, he's talking
[1:05:52] about the brethren. and says have not
[1:05:54] faith
[1:05:56] not faith in our Lord Jesus Christ but
[1:05:59] the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ. So
[1:06:02] the faith that we are talking about that
[1:06:04] have to become perfect faith. It has to
[1:06:06] become the faith of Jesus Christ.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; More than just believe in God because
[1:06:14] Satan also believe God. But you more
[1:06:18] than that no I I I sympathize with the
[1:06:21] message. I accept the message to certain
[1:06:23] point. Yeah. It's good but it's not good
[1:06:25] enough. We need to come to the point
[1:06:27] where you have the faith of God inside
[1:06:31] of your soul. God, give me the faith of
[1:06:34] the son of God. Amen. More than just
[1:06:37] believing. Amen. Are you with me?
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "Human faith wasn't
[1:06:42] enough then it is not enough. Now, it
[1:06:45] takes the very faith of the son of God
[1:06:48] to drop into a man's heart so that he
[1:06:52] can receive the Lord of glory into the
[1:06:54] temple not made with hands. Paul did not
[1:06:58] say he believed, he lived by the faith
[1:07:00] in the son of God. But it was the faith
[1:07:04] of the son of God that had given him
[1:07:06] life and kept him living in Christian
[1:07:09] victory. Do you want to have Christian
[1:07:12] victory? God, give me the faith of God.
[1:07:15] Amen. Your own faith, the faith of God,
[1:07:18] the faith of Abraham, the faith of the
[1:07:20] son of man. Amen. Then to weaken that
[1:07:24] seed of God himself.
[1:07:28] Hebrews 11 as Paul is summarized the
[1:07:31] life of Abraham said by faith when he
[1:07:33] had was called to go out into a place
[1:07:35] which he should not which he should
[1:07:37] after receive for inheritance which he
[1:07:39] should after receive for inheritance.
[1:07:42] Abraham obeyed God. So Abraham did not
[1:07:45] only believe and stay at the same place,
[1:07:48] you know. So I believe God, but I stay
[1:07:50] same place. No, when you believe, you
[1:07:52] obey. Amen.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; When you believe, you go to action. I
[1:07:57] believe and obey because work is the
[1:07:59] expression of the faith. Amen. You want
[1:08:02] faith. But that faith has to be
[1:08:04] expressed through the works. Amen.
[1:08:07] Through the mind, through the body has
[1:08:08] been has become visible. has become
[1:08:11] visible. Amen. Can't just uh keep it in
[1:08:14] your in your in in your heart and say
[1:08:16] that I believe but let me express it
[1:08:18] through my works. Amen. Are you with me?
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Then you know the story of Abraham and
[1:08:23] Sarah's body as they were changed they
[1:08:25] became young and in order to produce the
[1:08:28] son of the promise. I want to focus on
[1:08:30] the faith of the body change. Prophet
[1:08:33] says God changed her body and turned
[1:08:35] them back. It's a mystery that has to be
[1:08:39] revealed now in this day by the son of
[1:08:41] man. The evening message say turn back
[1:08:44] and that was the last sign they seen
[1:08:47] what the discernment before the change
[1:08:49] of the body of the body before the
[1:08:52] change of the body come. So this mystery
[1:08:55] of of the translation this mystery of
[1:08:58] the body change has to be revealed in
[1:09:01] this day by the son of man. The evening
[1:09:03] message, the evening message is the only
[1:09:06] message that can give the revelation of
[1:09:10] the translation, the revelation of the
[1:09:13] change of the body. Amen. You cannot
[1:09:15] find the revelation of the change of the
[1:09:18] body outside of the message of the hour.
[1:09:20] They might poke here, they might try
[1:09:22] here, they might represent here, but the
[1:09:24] message of the hour unveils what it is.
[1:09:27] The Bible we couldn't read that the body
[1:09:30] of Abraham was actually changed until
[1:09:32] the messenger came and he told us you
[1:09:34] know the Bible is written in such a way
[1:09:37] that only those who have the revelation
[1:09:39] can read between the lines. How could a
[1:09:42] king try to marry a old woman? No, it's
[1:09:45] not possible. He cannot marry an old
[1:09:48] woman. A king who has plenty of many
[1:09:50] girls he could find just to go and find
[1:09:53] that old woman. Oh, there is something
[1:09:55] that is working really bad in that in
[1:09:57] that king if it was the case. So, she
[1:10:00] had to be changed and become young again
[1:10:03] and then he could love or last. Oh, I
[1:10:06] will have a beautiful queen. Amen.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Only the prophet could pick that in the
[1:10:11] Bible and reveal that to us. Amen. And
[1:10:14] thank God for that. But how did that
[1:10:16] happen? How was it possible? How was it
[1:10:19] just a miracle in one day? Was how did
[1:10:21] it happen? Amen.
[1:10:23] The prophet says
[1:10:26] the first thing the same thing that he's
[1:10:28] going to do next and after that remember
[1:10:31] after the sign was manifested fully to
[1:10:33] Abraham and his group then the next
[1:10:35] thing come was that change and see that
[1:10:38] when we we done seen everything through
[1:10:41] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:10:43] of the Holy Ghost blessing of the son
[1:10:45] and the signs and wonders of him being
[1:10:48] in his presence and discern the thoughts
[1:10:50] of the heart and so forth as He says,
[1:10:52] "As it was in the days of Sodom, so
[1:10:55] shall it be in the coming of the son of
[1:10:57] man." We see that taking place right
[1:11:00] now. What was the next thing? The change
[1:11:03] of the body. So show that this we are
[1:11:06] looking for an expected son. Glory.
[1:11:09] Amen. Is that right? We cannot meet him
[1:11:12] in these bodies. You cannot expect to
[1:11:15] meet the Lord Jesus Christ in these
[1:11:17] bodies. Another place you will say these
[1:11:19] bodies are too heavy. There's so many
[1:11:21] things they need to be lightened by
[1:11:23] something else. Amen.
[1:11:26] If we are changed back to young men and
[1:11:28] women, still we can't see because we
[1:11:31] have to meet him in the air. Think about
[1:11:33] it. If you're just changed to be a young
[1:11:36] person, if you're just changed to be a
[1:11:37] young a young boy, young girl, does it
[1:11:40] qualify you to see the Lord Jesus
[1:11:42] Christ? No. Because we were young once.
[1:11:45] Amen. For those who are old, some of us
[1:11:47] are still young. Do you see the Lord
[1:11:48] Jesus Christ in the flesh? No. So
[1:11:50] something has has to be changed. Adam,
[1:11:54] Abraham and Sarah was not just changed
[1:11:56] to become young and then solve the
[1:11:58] problem of having a child. No, something
[1:12:01] had to be changed from the inside so
[1:12:03] that they could produce the son as well.
[1:12:06] It's not just changing to become young
[1:12:08] that solve the problem. Amen. Something
[1:12:10] has to happen from the inside. That what
[1:12:13] is giving the mystery of translation.
[1:12:16] Amen.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says
[1:12:20] there has to be something done besides
[1:12:22] change us back to young men and women.
[1:12:25] We've got to be changed and caught up in
[1:12:27] the air to meet him. And the next thing
[1:12:29] coming is the rapture of the church and
[1:12:31] the change of the body of the sleeping
[1:12:33] of the sleeping saints to meet the Lord
[1:12:35] Jesus in the air. As the Bible says,
[1:12:38] Hebrews 11 talking about Sarah and
[1:12:40] Abraham says, "These all died in faith,
[1:12:43] not having the promise, but having seen
[1:12:45] them were persuaded of them and embraced
[1:12:49] them." They embraced the promise of they
[1:12:52] embraced the promise of the body change.
[1:12:54] They embraced that. They they saw it for
[1:12:56] they saw it become in type in their
[1:12:59] life. But I believe they also saw a
[1:13:01] little bit of what God is going to do in
[1:13:04] reality in our lives because they were
[1:13:06] just a type. We are now the antitype of
[1:13:09] what they lived. Amen. Amen. They just
[1:13:12] received the type and we have the
[1:13:13] antitype of what they lived and said
[1:13:15] they embraced them. And we need to
[1:13:17] embrace the message. I like that. We
[1:13:19] need to embrace the message. We need to
[1:13:21] cherish the message. We need to love the
[1:13:23] message. You need to become part of the
[1:13:25] message. It has to become your your
[1:13:28] favorite things. Amen. The best thing
[1:13:30] you like has to be the message of the
[1:13:32] hour. We can give our life for the
[1:13:34] message of the hour. It's all our life.
[1:13:37] They embraced them and they confessed
[1:13:39] that they were strangers and pilgrims on
[1:13:41] the earth. But now they desire a better
[1:13:44] country that he is a heavenly. Wherefore
[1:13:47] God is not ashamed to be called their
[1:13:49] God, for he had prepared for them a
[1:13:51] city.
[1:13:53] But I'm not going to be
[1:13:56] but you and I we're going to be part of
[1:13:57] the body change and go into that city
[1:14:00] that they're looking for without going
[1:14:02] through the way of death. They they to
[1:14:04] go into that city they had to go through
[1:14:06] the way of death. They experienced the
[1:14:09] body change but after that they had to
[1:14:11] go to the way of death. I was just
[1:14:12] thinking about it. I'm not it was on my
[1:14:14] note but I was just thinking about it.
[1:14:16] You know even though they went to the
[1:14:17] body changed they became young but still
[1:14:20] the Bible count their days from the
[1:14:22] place when they started thinking about
[1:14:24] it but but think about it they went
[1:14:26] through the way of death but you and I
[1:14:29] we are not going to go to the way of
[1:14:30] death by God's grace if the rapture
[1:14:32] happens. Amen. Because we we are not in
[1:14:34] the antitype we are in the reality of
[1:14:37] what they they went through. Amen. The
[1:14:39] prophet says they ask him a question
[1:14:41] explain the mystery of the translation
[1:14:43] of the bride.
[1:14:45] Then he says it's not this outside. See,
[1:14:49] taste, feel, smell, and hear. It isn't.
[1:14:52] In other words, says it's not it's not
[1:14:55] don't focus too much on this outside
[1:14:57] here.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; As he's describing, don't desri don't
[1:15:01] focus too much on the outside. Say it's
[1:15:03] subject to death and will die. But
[1:15:06] inside part of you down in here inside
[1:15:11] that is the person that can never die.
[1:15:14] Say the focus is here. That's the person
[1:15:17] that can never die.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; So if you want to understand the
[1:15:20] translation, look at where that person
[1:15:22] that cannot die. So that's the person
[1:15:24] that the new life starts from from this
[1:15:27] new birth and it builds another person
[1:15:29] in the image of this person you are
[1:15:32] around that life. You get it? So
[1:15:35] potential it's there. So potential the
[1:15:38] body the body change is right here.
[1:15:41] Potential it's already there.
[1:15:43] potentially it's already there that
[1:15:44] small seed there but the life it has to
[1:15:48] build it has to grow it has to grow it
[1:15:50] has to grow
[1:15:52] are you with me
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; so potentially it's there and what is it
[1:15:55] the word promised before the foundation
[1:15:58] of the world and around there this only
[1:16:00] reflect the negative this only reflect
[1:16:03] the negative
[1:16:05] but this here is the positive it says
[1:16:08] that will reflect that will reflect the
[1:16:10] positive the word so the same thing here
[1:16:13] the translation of the bride will be the
[1:16:15] same thing the words that in you the
[1:16:18] body will materialize around that word
[1:16:21] that seed that God put there is the word
[1:16:23] of God so that word of God when it meets
[1:16:26] the word of God that comes from the
[1:16:28] outside it's quicken Amen the more it
[1:16:32] eats the word of God from the outside
[1:16:34] the more it's growing the more it's
[1:16:37] taking full control of the whole body
[1:16:39] amen
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; that's why from the inside you can have
[1:16:42] control upon the body. The prophet say
[1:16:44] the proof of the proof that you have
[1:16:46] been born again is when this body is
[1:16:48] subject to the inside.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; That's the control tower that one has to
[1:16:54] be controlling you. Amen.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; You can do many things here from the
[1:16:58] outside are good things but if there is
[1:17:00] no life inside there it's useless. Amen.
[1:17:03] So it has to come from the inside going
[1:17:06] outside. but by listening for the word
[1:17:09] of God that comes from the outside.
[1:17:11] That's why we can never overemphasize
[1:17:14] the importance of listening to the word
[1:17:17] of God
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; because you are the word of God.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; In order to grow, you need the word of
[1:17:22] God.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; You cannot add a seed in the natural as
[1:17:26] a seed is growing the womb of the
[1:17:27] mother. You cannot have one cell that of
[1:17:30] a nature of a pig and one cell of the
[1:17:32] nature of a of of a chameleon. One oh
[1:17:35] what you become a monster. Amen. It has
[1:17:37] to be the cell of a human being that
[1:17:39] continue to grow, that continue to grow,
[1:17:41] that continue to grow. The same thing if
[1:17:43] you are the word of God, a small portion
[1:17:46] of the word of God here, you have to
[1:17:48] receive the word of God in order to grow
[1:17:51] and become the full maturity of the word
[1:17:53] of God. Amen.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; And it has to be the word of God for
[1:18:00] your age.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; It has to be the word of God for our
[1:18:03] age. The word of God of Luther could
[1:18:06] never produce the rapturing faith. The
[1:18:08] word of God of of Wesley could never
[1:18:11] produce the rapturing faith. It has to
[1:18:13] become the word for the season. The word
[1:18:16] for the rapturing faith that will
[1:18:18] produce the faith for the rapture.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; So we are not just an organization or a
[1:18:26] group. We are the very bride of Jesus
[1:18:30] Christ predestinated for the rapture in
[1:18:33] this age.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; He says that body will materialize
[1:18:38] around the world and the same thing did
[1:18:40] by Sarah. When that old body that she
[1:18:42] had the first body, it had to be changed
[1:18:45] in order to produce a son. You get it?
[1:18:48] That body could not do it. This body
[1:18:50] cannot do it. It have to be changed the
[1:18:53] same way to receive the sun. It has to
[1:18:55] be changed from the inside to the
[1:18:57] outside.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; The prophet says or the Bible says
[1:19:08] Hebrews 11
[1:19:10] this old having obtained a good report
[1:19:12] through faith received not the promise
[1:19:15] have God having provided some better
[1:19:17] thing for us that they without us should
[1:19:20] not be made perfect. So it's not because
[1:19:23] we are better than Luther. Not because
[1:19:25] we are better than Wesley or you know in
[1:19:27] the natural way. No they had to receive
[1:19:30] the word for their age. The revelation
[1:19:32] that was released for their age. The
[1:19:34] measure of the faith that was released
[1:19:36] for their age and it produced
[1:19:38] justifications. They had to release the
[1:19:41] the word for age produced
[1:19:42] sanctification. Now the word that has
[1:19:45] been released for age has to produce the
[1:19:47] body change. Amen.
[1:19:50] The prophet says, "I want you to get
[1:19:52] built upon now, built up now on this
[1:19:55] this holy oracle of God in the faith,
[1:19:58] the faith of this hour. The faith, it's
[1:20:01] going to take more faith than ever was
[1:20:03] in any age for this has to be rapturing
[1:20:07] faith to be taken up. So if you want you
[1:20:11] to believe tonight in all that we have
[1:20:13] seen heard the word that we have heard
[1:20:15] preached the signs and the wonders that
[1:20:17] we have done seen you you you we want
[1:20:21] you to accumulate all that together in
[1:20:23] your heart and consider it whether it be
[1:20:26] God or not.
[1:20:29] Amen.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Abraham was not in Sodom. He was already
[1:20:34] called out. There was one stayed and
[1:20:36] talked to him. The one stayed and talked
[1:20:39] with him showed him a sign. With his
[1:20:42] back turned, he said, he he said Sarah
[1:20:44] was going to have the baby that he had
[1:20:46] waited for. Amen. With his back turned,
[1:20:49] he called it God Elohim. That brings you
[1:20:52] that brings to pass today because we
[1:20:54] have faith. I know this is of God is
[1:20:57] because this and other scripture point
[1:21:00] to this hour. Revelation 10 says in the
[1:21:03] hour of the seventh angel message when
[1:21:05] he begins to sound forth his message not
[1:21:09] a healing service but the message that
[1:21:12] follows the healing service.
[1:21:15] There is no other let me say this there
[1:21:16] is no other thing that can produce
[1:21:20] the body change except you receive the
[1:21:23] ministry of the son of man.
[1:21:34] Pentecostals calls it, you know, the
[1:21:37] word of wisdom. Oh, brother Bam had only
[1:21:39] the word of wisdom. Now, you know, it
[1:21:42] was good ministry. It was a prophet. It
[1:21:44] was a servant of God. They put him in a
[1:21:46] a minor prophet. They say, "Oh, it was
[1:21:48] just the word of wisdom." No, it's more
[1:21:50] than the word of wisdom. It was the
[1:21:52] ministry of the son of man. Because in
[1:21:55] order to produce the body change, you
[1:21:58] need to receive the ministry of the son
[1:22:00] of man. The same way as Abraham had to
[1:22:03] receive the ministry of the son of man.
[1:22:05] That's what the prophet said. He called
[1:22:07] him God Elohim.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; We went through that on Wednesday. You
[1:22:11] know the message is not about brother
[1:22:12] Vanam. Brother Vanam was just a man. But
[1:22:15] the God inside of brother Vanam was the
[1:22:18] God Elohim. Amen. As brother Bam was be
[1:22:21] speaking and discerning the thought, he
[1:22:22] will say, you know, I have to listen to
[1:22:24] the tapes to hear what he said.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Because it's not me saying, it was him
[1:22:29] saying sometimes he will turn the the
[1:22:32] the is the back, I don't know you, I
[1:22:34] don't know him, I can't even see you.
[1:22:36] But he would describe the person in the
[1:22:38] room to showing that is the same
[1:22:40] ministry as Abraham received in order to
[1:22:43] produce the son of God. In order to
[1:22:46] produce the promised son, you need to
[1:22:48] receive the ministry of the son of man.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; The church has to be the word and he is
[1:22:56] the word and the two unites together.
[1:22:58] And to do that, the prophet says it will
[1:23:01] take the manifestation of the revealing
[1:23:04] of the son of man.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are not in the age where the
[1:23:09] faith is the prevalent ver virtue. But
[1:23:11] we are in the age of of of of the
[1:23:13] capstone or the age of brotherly
[1:23:15] kindness by the capstone coming down.
[1:23:17] But let me tell you the capstone as he
[1:23:19] comes down the the person of the Holy
[1:23:22] Ghost when he comes down he has to give
[1:23:24] us perfect faith.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; The faith that we have to receive is
[1:23:28] more faith than any other age because
[1:23:31] now we have to receive the faith for the
[1:23:34] rapture. Amen. Amen.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; The first age could have received that
[1:23:38] faith for the rapture. But they went
[1:23:41] away for the first love. They backslid
[1:23:43] before they could receive that. Thank
[1:23:45] God in our age this Eve can never be
[1:23:48] deceived.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; She has received the perfect word to
[1:23:52] produce the perfect love, the perfect
[1:23:54] faith of God.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. We should more should be more
[1:23:58] thankful for what God has done in our
[1:24:00] life. Amen.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet says Jesus went
[1:24:04] forth and preached. He said he healed
[1:24:06] the sick and everything. And that young
[1:24:09] rabbi or the prophet, he's a great
[1:24:11] fellow. We want him in our church. But
[1:24:14] one day he stood up and said, "I and my
[1:24:16] father are one." So in other words,
[1:24:20] Jesus Christ had also
[1:24:24] the first pool, the second pool, and the
[1:24:26] third pool. the first pool
[1:24:33] and many young people. These are good to
[1:24:35] to re review all those things. The voice
[1:24:39] pool was when you could sense you know
[1:24:42] the sickness in the flesh and it's
[1:24:44] manifesting on the flesh and if it
[1:24:46] disappears it will declare you you are
[1:24:48] healed. It was affecting the body the
[1:24:51] flesh. That's why the first pool was
[1:24:53] affecting. Amen. The second pool was in
[1:24:57] the mind. The reading of the thought
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; affect the mind
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; and you could read the thought what you
[1:25:07] are thinking and oh and everything. Oh
[1:25:09] and it could discern that the thought
[1:25:11] and of the mind or what you what you are
[1:25:14] thinking about. But the third pull
[1:25:19] it goes to the soul
[1:25:26] to the heart to the soul. It goes deeper
[1:25:29] deeper inside. Amen. That's why the
[1:25:31] prophet say you can be anointed with the
[1:25:33] Holy Ghost in the body as much as you
[1:25:36] can. You can speak in tongues. You can
[1:25:38] feel sensation all the thing and there
[1:25:40] are genuine Holy Ghost upon the body.
[1:25:43] Sometimes you can feel it in the mind.
[1:25:45] You feel like oh I'm feel so good. I
[1:25:47] feel like today I'm saved. Oh and I'm
[1:25:49] going forward. I'm a Christian. You feel
[1:25:51] that in the mind. Say you all that is
[1:25:53] good but you can you are still lost. In
[1:25:56] this age you are still lost.
[1:25:58] Only when it goes deep into the soul
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; and that's what the message of the hour
[1:26:04] come. The message of the hour come to
[1:26:06] speak to the soul to discern the intent
[1:26:09] of the soul of the heart of the soul.
[1:26:12] The message comes to give us faith in
[1:26:14] the soul. Amen.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Different for denominations, different
[1:26:18] from any other systems. It comes to
[1:26:20] speak to change the heart. That's why
[1:26:22] the ministry of Malachi 4 is to change
[1:26:25] the heart, to change the soul. Amen.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; The prophet says,
[1:26:35] hope I'm not shouting, amen.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Hope it's okay. But one day he stood up
[1:26:40] and said I and my father are one. Oh my.
[1:26:43] They didn't want him no more. Then I
[1:26:45] believe the bride has to come to the
[1:26:47] place you know now the father Jesus
[1:26:50] Christ and I we are one.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Your unity of the bride. The harmony
[1:26:54] that was between the father and Jesus
[1:26:56] Christ. Now the same harmony has to
[1:26:58] happen between Jesus Christ and the
[1:27:00] bride. I and my father we are one. Or
[1:27:03] they didn't want him no more. Oh, except
[1:27:05] you eat the flesh of the son of man and
[1:27:08] drink his blood. He didn't explain it.
[1:27:11] He said, "Except you eat the flesh of
[1:27:13] the son of man and drink his blood, you
[1:27:15] have no life in you." Why? I imagine
[1:27:17] some doctors and nurses say this fellow
[1:27:19] is a vampire trying to get us to drink
[1:27:21] his blood. See, they didn't understand
[1:27:23] it. They know it. But this disciple,
[1:27:25] they did not have to be able to explain,
[1:27:27] but they sat there and believed it
[1:27:29] anyhow for it was revealed to them. It
[1:27:31] was revealed to them. They know it. The
[1:27:33] scripture had declared it. Amen. They
[1:27:35] had to they in that time they had to eat
[1:27:38] the flesh and the blood of the son of
[1:27:40] man. But actually the same thing applies
[1:27:42] to us as well. You and I, we have to eat
[1:27:45] this the flesh and drink the blood of
[1:27:48] the son of man once again. Because we
[1:27:50] are not feeding upon a man. We're not
[1:27:52] feeding upon a theory of brother Bannam.
[1:27:54] We are feeding upon the body word and
[1:27:56] unfailing body word of the son of man.
[1:27:59] We have to feed upon the ministry of the
[1:28:02] son of man in order to have the body
[1:28:05] change. Amen.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; That's why it's important to to to come
[1:28:09] to church. It's important to listen to
[1:28:11] the tapes. It's very extremely
[1:28:14] important. We can never overemphasize
[1:28:16] that you want to have victory in the
[1:28:18] time of laudicia and to meet the
[1:28:21] challenge of the age, you have to feed
[1:28:23] upon the word of God.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; There's no other solution. The provided
[1:28:28] way is the word of God.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; There's one thing I can give you an
[1:28:33] advice. Stay with the word of God.
[1:28:35] There's so many distraction going on. So
[1:28:38] many Facebook and chat Snapchat and all
[1:28:42] the different things. Oh, just to
[1:28:44] distract us because they're distracting
[1:28:46] us from feeding upon the son of man.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Let put sometimes all those things
[1:28:53] aside. I want to feed upon the son of
[1:28:55] man. Amen.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; And sometimes even the song I would
[1:28:59] encourage you to to to listen to the
[1:29:01] songs where that where they're
[1:29:02] mentioning the the word of God over age
[1:29:05] more if I could encourage you. Why?
[1:29:08] Because that it should produce life.
[1:29:10] Amen. That's what we are called for. We
[1:29:12] are we are predestinated for
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; God is waiting on us. Amen.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; The prophet says you're not feeding on a
[1:29:22] man. A man his word will fail but you
[1:29:25] are feeding on the unfailing body word
[1:29:27] of the son of man. If you haven't fed
[1:29:30] fully fully on every word to give glory
[1:29:33] to to give yourself to give yourself
[1:29:36] strength to fly above all these
[1:29:38] denomination and things of the world.
[1:29:40] Will you at this time do it? Because
[1:29:43] there is only way to fly above the
[1:29:46] denomination. the things of the world is
[1:29:48] to feed upon the body word unfailing
[1:29:51] body word of the son of man. Amen.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; So do you know what happens if you
[1:30:00] reject the third pool? Last time we
[1:30:02] showed how to become if you reject the
[1:30:04] message of the eye you become a
[1:30:06] candidate to be to receive the mark of
[1:30:08] the beast. But now again if you reject
[1:30:11] the third pool you risk to be part of
[1:30:16] what first Corinthians 13 says.
[1:30:19] Though I speak with tongues of man and
[1:30:21] angels have not charity. I have become a
[1:30:24] sounding brass of tinkling symbol. And
[1:30:27] though I have the gift of prophecy and
[1:30:29] understand all mysteries and all
[1:30:31] knowledge, and though I have all faith
[1:30:34] so that I could remove mountains and
[1:30:36] have no charity, I am nothing.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Although I bestow all my goods to feed
[1:30:42] the poor and though I give my body to be
[1:30:44] burned to be burned and have no charity,
[1:30:47] it profitth me nothing. This is the time
[1:30:50] of the maturity of the Christians. Those
[1:30:54] things that I'm not saying they're not
[1:30:55] useful. They're useful. They're
[1:30:57] important. But it goes deeper than that.
[1:31:00] It has to become the love of God. The
[1:31:03] prophet says take all the gift that you
[1:31:04] have in the scripture. The devil can
[1:31:07] impersonate anything. He can impersonate
[1:31:09] anything. Any gift, any work. He can
[1:31:13] imperson many things here. Even some
[1:31:15] people, some are even trying to
[1:31:17] impersonate some discernment. You know
[1:31:19] today trying to impersonate sometime
[1:31:21] they fail but trying to impersonate that
[1:31:23] because the devil can impersonate many
[1:31:25] things in the spirit in the body but the
[1:31:27] only thing he cannot impersonate it is
[1:31:30] the soul that se that inside of you
[1:31:33] there he can never impersonate that
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; you know in the natural your DNA is what
[1:31:38] you are nobody can impersonate that the
[1:31:41] same thing when you have the seed of God
[1:31:43] is the DNA of God himself there nothing
[1:31:46] can impersonate that. Amen. The only
[1:31:49] thing that can give life to that seed is
[1:31:51] the word of God.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; The word of the ministry of the son of
[1:31:54] man. The third pool we have received.
[1:31:57] Amen.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; It will produce the love of God.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; And the real love of God. Amen. The love
[1:32:03] of God that will come from the inside
[1:32:06] going to the outside. Amen. Sometime we
[1:32:08] can have the little of love of God here.
[1:32:10] You know I will be with my brother. I
[1:32:12] will be with the people who love me.
[1:32:13] Those who hate me, you know, I put them.
[1:32:15] I can't stand them.
[1:32:17] I just tell you the clothes that you
[1:32:19] look like a lovely person it's maybe on
[1:32:21] this side over here but when it come
[1:32:23] from the inside here the real agap love
[1:32:27] proverb say you'll be even able to love
[1:32:29] your worst enemy but you still love him
[1:32:32] you still pray for him you still want
[1:32:34] the best of for him oh god help us to
[1:32:36] come to that level where we can have the
[1:32:39] real love of god inside there oh lord I
[1:32:42] can love anybody
[1:32:48] says we prophet said the devil can
[1:32:50] impersonate every one of them
[1:32:52] but he can't impersonate love because
[1:32:55] love is genuine. The devil can't love.
[1:32:59] That's one thing he can't do.
[1:33:02] The enemy, the devil doesn't love you.
[1:33:08] It might look like he's giving you good
[1:33:10] things, but he doesn't love you. He has
[1:33:12] no ability to love. The devil can't love
[1:33:16] any person. He doesn't love. He always
[1:33:18] takes you and will bring you further
[1:33:20] than you thought you will go. He doesn't
[1:33:22] love you. Amen. Let's put that now to to
[1:33:24] our level as well. If you don't love
[1:33:27] your brother or your sister, no, if come
[1:33:29] to the point say I can't stand that
[1:33:30] brother, I can't stand that sister.
[1:33:32] Maybe you are in a very dangerous place
[1:33:35] where you are doing the job of the enemy
[1:33:38] because God loves an unconditional love.
[1:33:41] Unconditional love. No matter what they
[1:33:44] have done to you, no matter what they
[1:33:45] they they will do to me, but I still I
[1:33:48] still want them to be saved.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; I read sometimes the story of brother
[1:33:52] brother, the one one who killed who
[1:33:54] killed his his dog Fritz. So now I have
[1:33:57] to kill that policeman. I have to kill
[1:33:58] him. But then when he got saved, oh, I
[1:34:01] prayed for him. He got saved. Can you
[1:34:05] imagine he's a believer of the one who
[1:34:06] killed the dog and will be in heaven
[1:34:08] with the dog he killed.
[1:34:11] Why? Because oh perfect love takes over
[1:34:14] all these things. Amen. Oh, that brother
[1:34:17] did to me that thing. I can't forgive
[1:34:19] him. I can't know because I Oh, oh, God
[1:34:22] help us to move ahead of that.
[1:34:27] Even the Bible says if a man says I love
[1:34:29] God and hateth his brother, the Bible
[1:34:31] says he's a liar. For he that loveth not
[1:34:34] his brother whom he had seen, how can he
[1:34:37] love God whom he has not seen.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; So I love God, I love God, but you hate
[1:34:41] your brother, you hate your sister, or
[1:34:43] you can't help your sister. You can't
[1:34:45] help your brother. Uh h God God doubts
[1:34:49] that kind of love.
[1:34:52] Prophecy says prophet love won't your
[1:34:55] love reach right back to him. There is a
[1:34:58] love affair. No matter what the
[1:35:01] situation is its circumstances is
[1:35:04] governed by this love that create faith
[1:35:07] that God loves you and you love God and
[1:35:10] you love one another. That brings that
[1:35:13] faith. All right. Then it can't keep
[1:35:16] from bringing you out just exactly what
[1:35:19] God promised he will do. So what will
[1:35:22] bring that faith? When you when God
[1:35:24] loves you and you in return, you love
[1:35:28] God and then you love one another.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want perfect faith. I want
[1:35:34] rapturing faith. The key is there. God
[1:35:38] loves you first unconditionally.
[1:35:41] Thank you. Realize, oh, God loved me.
[1:35:43] Now I love God. Thank you, God. Thank
[1:35:45] you for loving me. But that could still
[1:35:48] stay superficial. Now go deeper. Love
[1:35:51] one another. That will produce perfect
[1:35:54] faith.
[1:35:58] Perfect faith is pure. As pure as love
[1:36:00] is. So when you love somebody, you love
[1:36:03] your husband or your you love your wife.
[1:36:06] There's no need of anybody telling you
[1:36:08] you don't do it because you do do it and
[1:36:12] you know you do it. That's why in the
[1:36:14] adoption series, brother Banam will
[1:36:16] preach and before he preaching those
[1:36:19] adoption series, God will give him that
[1:36:21] experience of a translation of going to
[1:36:23] the other side. And as he went to other
[1:36:25] side, the voice told him nothing can
[1:36:28] enter here but perfect love. Nothing can
[1:36:31] go on the other side but perfect love.
[1:36:34] But I thought it was only perfect faith.
[1:36:36] No, perfect faith and perfect love when
[1:36:39] they come to the perfection is the same
[1:36:40] thing. Because in order to have perfect
[1:36:43] faith, you need to have perfect love.
[1:36:46] The prophet the voice will tell him this
[1:36:48] is the Holy Ghost. What is the Holy
[1:36:50] Ghost is perfect love. Amen. What is
[1:36:52] what is perfect faith? What is the Holy
[1:36:54] Ghost is perfect faith. In order to come
[1:36:56] to perfection, you need the perfect
[1:36:58] love. And what can produce the perfect
[1:37:00] love? Only if you feed upon the word of
[1:37:03] God.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; You cannot fabricate perfect love.
[1:37:07] Perfect love has to come from the word
[1:37:08] of God. Perfect love has come from the
[1:37:11] Holy Spirit. Amen. As you feed upon the
[1:37:14] word of God, you see things going around
[1:37:16] going away. Things that are not part of
[1:37:18] the perfect love will go away. Amen.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; But I'm more determined than heaven in
[1:37:26] my life that it takes perfect love to
[1:37:29] enter there.
[1:37:33] Looks like I'm jumping already to
[1:37:35] capstone already. But just want to say
[1:37:37] when you come to perfection,
[1:37:40] the headstone is love. And that love is
[1:37:42] what has to produce the perfect faith.
[1:37:46] The prophet says in the message statue
[1:37:47] of the perfect man that they're waiting
[1:37:50] for the headstone which is love for God
[1:37:52] is love and he controls. So that love
[1:37:55] controls and is the strength of everyone
[1:37:58] of these others.
[1:38:01] As a prophet, if you see prophet
[1:38:02] preaches about justification,
[1:38:05] Luther had a message of justification.
[1:38:08] Luther had a message of justification.
[1:38:10] He could have preached the message of
[1:38:12] just he preached the message of
[1:38:13] sanctification. Wesley had the message
[1:38:15] of of san of justification. Wesley had
[1:38:18] the message of sanctification. He
[1:38:20] preached the message of sanctification.
[1:38:22] Amen.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Godliness. He preached it so
[1:38:25] powerfully preached and he had great
[1:38:27] miracles. But let me tell you they still
[1:38:30] left some loose hands. Only when the
[1:38:33] opening of the word comes and reveals to
[1:38:36] us what is really justification.
[1:38:39] Justification is not only being
[1:38:41] forgiven. Justification is as if we have
[1:38:44] never never seen to begin with. So the
[1:38:47] prophet comes at the opening of the word
[1:38:49] at the third pool which is the opening
[1:38:51] of the word. He gives us even more
[1:38:53] clarification of what justification is.
[1:38:56] Amen. It gives us more strength of what
[1:38:59] sanctification is. You can be sanctified
[1:39:02] by just being oh no I want I want and
[1:39:04] you have to make decisions. You have to
[1:39:05] get separate from this. You have to make
[1:39:07] those decision and they are important.
[1:39:09] You have you have to make a decision to
[1:39:11] get away from the television. You have
[1:39:13] to get away from the the phone that
[1:39:15] keeps you so you have to make that
[1:39:17] decision.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; But more than that, amen. When the Holy
[1:39:21] Ghost comes, it gives you power to
[1:39:23] overcome those things. Amen. that was
[1:39:26] saying so we you need faith the same
[1:39:28] thing in the similarity you need the
[1:39:30] faith and you need to have the faith and
[1:39:32] Paul preached the faith but when the
[1:39:34] capstone comes he gives you perfect
[1:39:37] faith give you the strength to have that
[1:39:39] perfect faith amen
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; aren't you thankful for receiving the
[1:39:43] message of the hour
[1:39:50] so Galatians 5:6 says in Jesus Christ
[1:39:53] neither circumcision ath anything knows
[1:39:56] because it's about but faith which
[1:39:57] workketh by love.
[1:40:01] Prophet says love and faith has to go
[1:40:03] together. The kings folk they love. The
[1:40:07] love produces faith.
[1:40:10] Faith and love is relation. Because you
[1:40:12] can't have faith unless you got love.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Because your faith is in a God who is
[1:40:18] the very essence of love. Amen.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Faith and love work together just like a
[1:40:24] young couple. You take a young couple,
[1:40:26] young woman, and they love each other.
[1:40:28] They fall in love with one another. Oh,
[1:40:30] they go along and begin to know one
[1:40:32] another. Their hearts just begin to be
[1:40:34] beat as one. They are not husband and
[1:40:36] wife, but the love binds them together.
[1:40:39] They have confidence in one another. Oh,
[1:40:41] if they really love one another, really
[1:40:43] love, you know that that girl loves you
[1:40:46] and she knows that you love her. You got
[1:40:49] confidence, faith in one another. You
[1:40:51] got faith in one another. If you didn't,
[1:40:53] you better not marry her. Oh, good
[1:40:56] advice. If you don't have faith in her,
[1:40:58] I doubt him. You know, I will see if in
[1:41:01] marriage I will can arrange that. You
[1:41:02] know, don't go there. You can't fix
[1:41:05] things in marriage if you don't have
[1:41:07] faith before getting married.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Make sure that he loves you. Make sure
[1:41:11] that you love that person. Amen.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; That That's free advertisement. Amen.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Free.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Make sure that you laugh. Look, sister
[1:41:21] Esther has her husband is way but her
[1:41:25] heart is beating. She's even want me to
[1:41:28] close a little bit earlier because she
[1:41:30] want to go and talk to her husband.
[1:41:34] She's in love. Amen. She's you can come
[1:41:37] and tell her whatever you want to tell
[1:41:39] her about husband. She knows her husband
[1:41:41] than anyone else here. She trusts her
[1:41:44] husband so much than anything any report
[1:41:47] you can bring. She has faith in her
[1:41:50] husband and her husband has faith in
[1:41:52] her. The same thing spiritually
[1:41:53] attending. When you love the Lord Jesus
[1:41:56] Christ, the secret is he loves you. Now
[1:41:59] you love him back. If you love him back,
[1:42:01] you have perfect faith because you know
[1:42:04] that he cannot do anything that will go
[1:42:07] in order to hurt you. Amen. Because you
[1:42:09] love him and he loves you back. Amen.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:16] I want to read everything but just want
[1:42:18] to read that part. He says he had been a
[1:42:20] Christian a couple. They take that
[1:42:21] example. I like that example. They got
[1:42:23] married. They love and had confidence in
[1:42:25] one another and they got married. So the
[1:42:27] woman said to the man who was not
[1:42:29] strong. He said, "Habby, it must be hard
[1:42:32] on you. You're just a young Christian.
[1:42:34] You had so much to go through. Drinking
[1:42:37] is what it was said. You had so much to
[1:42:39] go through." He said, "I know you are
[1:42:41] bound to be tempted awfully hard." And
[1:42:44] he said, "I want you to know one thing
[1:42:46] that if you happen to fall, if you
[1:42:48] happen into temptation is overcome,
[1:42:51] don't stay away from home. You come, you
[1:42:55] come on back. You're right. Ah, you come
[1:42:57] right here because I'm going to be right
[1:43:00] here waiting for you and I'm going to
[1:43:02] help you pray through again until you
[1:43:05] get victory."
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; That's a wonderful wife.
[1:43:10] See a husband is weak in that area. It
[1:43:12] can be the other way around. You see
[1:43:14] your wife is weak in that area. Say no.
[1:43:16] Give him that unconditional love. You
[1:43:19] see your ch children that weak in this
[1:43:22] area. Give them that unconditional love
[1:43:24] because that's what God has done for us.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Says you you can you you make a mistake.
[1:43:28] You make a decision to follow me. You'll
[1:43:30] make mistakes. But remember wherever you
[1:43:34] are, if you make a mistakes, come still.
[1:43:36] Come still to me. I'm still there
[1:43:39] waiting for you because I'm going to
[1:43:41] help you get through. Amen.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; If you could put that, you know,
[1:43:45] sometimes we take the other way around.
[1:43:46] Oh, I I Oh, no. I I done something
[1:43:48] wrong. No, I I can't go to church. I
[1:43:50] feel like I'm No, I No, don't go away.
[1:43:55] Come because he's still waiting for you
[1:43:57] here.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; If you go away, you you'll go down
[1:44:01] deeper. That's what the enemy wants you
[1:44:03] to go. But stay stay in the word of God.
[1:44:06] You go more in the word of God because
[1:44:08] he's there waiting for you. His love is
[1:44:11] unconditional. Amen. And in our natural
[1:44:14] life where the same thing, brother, my
[1:44:16] sister, brother, I love you
[1:44:18] unconditionally. No matter what, I still
[1:44:20] love you. My son, my daughter, I still
[1:44:22] love you no matter what. I still love
[1:44:24] you. My love is unconditional.
[1:44:28] No man can come to me except the father
[1:44:30] draws him first. And God drawn in that
[1:44:32] mark where you were and sought you and
[1:44:34] brought you out. that ought to create a
[1:44:36] perfect love. Look what he was and look
[1:44:39] what you are. What did that somebody
[1:44:41] loves you? Can't you have faith in what
[1:44:44] he has promised you? Then real genuine
[1:44:47] love will create confidence in his word.
[1:44:50] He caught me when I was nothing. I'm
[1:44:52] still nothing but I'm in his hand. He
[1:44:55] caught me and I and he loved me when I
[1:44:58] was unlovable. He loved you when you
[1:45:00] were unlovable but he changed you just
[1:45:03] like the carrot sister say that in time
[1:45:06] is her testimony. I'm not what I ought
[1:45:08] to be. I'm not what I want to be but I'm
[1:45:10] not what I used to be. She know that she
[1:45:13] come from somewhere something happened.
[1:45:15] That's the way it is. If God when I was
[1:45:17] an alien from him so loved me till he
[1:45:20] stooped down to get me and pick me up
[1:45:23] that gives me confidence that he wants
[1:45:25] to use me. He's got a purpose in doing
[1:45:28] it. Amen. He's seen something in me.
[1:45:30] Amen. He seen something in you. He had a
[1:45:33] reason to save you. Look at the people
[1:45:35] that are saved today. Look at the
[1:45:37] million that he could not save, but he
[1:45:39] saved you.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; I love that. Look at the people that
[1:45:43] they didn't he didn't save them, but he
[1:45:44] loved you. Amen. So, how do I get
[1:45:47] perfect love? We're talking about
[1:45:48] perfection. We're not talking about just
[1:45:51] without perfection. Perfection.
[1:45:53] going to erase some of the things you
[1:45:54] feel.
[1:45:59] He can wait.
[1:46:04] Perfection,
[1:46:07] perfect love.
[1:46:10] Create
[1:46:15] sovereign grace.
[1:46:17] Create
[1:46:19] perfect faith.
[1:46:24] That's the typical.
[1:46:27] So as God looks at things, God loved us
[1:46:31] unconditionally.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Divine love. As his love was projected,
[1:46:37] sovereign grace or perfect grace took
[1:46:39] over.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; As the perfect grace took over, God give
[1:46:43] us faith. Amen.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; God give us faith. It's a gift of God.
[1:46:48] God is the perfect. You can't you can't
[1:46:51] force yourself to have faith. You can't
[1:46:54] force yourself to have faith. Amen. God
[1:46:56] gives you that seed
[1:47:00] and he allows you to read to listen the
[1:47:02] word of God to come to perfect faith.
[1:47:04] But in his mind, he loved you
[1:47:06] unconditionally. As the prophet says,
[1:47:09] you didn't he he has revealed it to you
[1:47:11] by his grace. It's nothing you did. You
[1:47:13] didn't work yourself into faith. You
[1:47:16] ever have faith? If you ever have faith,
[1:47:18] it's given to you by the grace of God
[1:47:22] because God project his love and then
[1:47:25] the love sovereign grace take over and
[1:47:28] then that sovereign grace God gives you
[1:47:31] perfect faith. That's why Paul could say
[1:47:33] who can separate us from the love of
[1:47:35] God. Once you have the true revelation
[1:47:38] of the love of God, once we understand
[1:47:41] the true revelation of the love of God,
[1:47:43] I would tell you we won't have be under
[1:47:45] under fear anymore. Because there is no
[1:47:48] fear in perfect love. There is no fear
[1:47:50] in perfect grace. There's no fear in
[1:47:52] perfect in perfect faith. Why? Because
[1:47:55] if you have the true revelation that God
[1:47:57] loves you unconditionally, he can't lose
[1:47:59] you. You should not be afraid of
[1:48:01] anything. You should be walking where I
[1:48:03] we we with confidence in God in
[1:48:06] confidence in the word of God. God loved
[1:48:08] me. God loves me. No matter the
[1:48:10] circumstances, whether they are low,
[1:48:12] they are deep, they are bad, God loves
[1:48:14] me. Amen. When you have the revelation
[1:48:17] of those things, I would say you become
[1:48:19] when you have the revelation of those
[1:48:21] things, you become master of
[1:48:23] circumstances.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:32] You just read my cryptic word there. But
[1:48:35] you become a master of circumstance
[1:48:37] because why? It's not what you It's not
[1:48:40] what you feel anymore. It's not what you
[1:48:42] think even anymore. But it's deep inside
[1:48:46] that. It's it's the tower of control
[1:48:48] there. It's the control tower that say
[1:48:50] no God loves me. God loves me. I have
[1:48:53] the revelation of God loves me. That's
[1:48:55] why the prophet says you you know the
[1:48:57] stormy skies or the blue skies is not a
[1:49:00] type or or the clean skies paraphrasing
[1:49:03] is not is not a sign of God's approval.
[1:49:06] The approval of God is God's love. God
[1:49:09] has elected me before the foundation of
[1:49:12] the world whether it's going good or
[1:49:14] it's going bad I know that God loves me.
[1:49:18] How do you know that God loves you? He
[1:49:20] gave you the word of God. Only you have
[1:49:23] that capability to hear the word of God
[1:49:26] and say, "Oh, that's nothing else but
[1:49:28] the truth."
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? Haty right was there
[1:49:32] and said that's nothing but the truth.
[1:49:34] The deacon was there. He could not say
[1:49:36] that's nothing but the truth. But he had
[1:49:38] that capacity to say that's that's the
[1:49:41] truth. There
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; God has given you the same capacity to
[1:49:44] recognize the word of God for you.
[1:49:47] That's the sign. That's the proof, the
[1:49:49] ultimate proof that God loves you.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; So the cloudy skies and storms of pray
[1:50:01] or storms of life are no sign of God's
[1:50:04] approval. Neither are bright skies or
[1:50:06] still waters. Signs of his love or
[1:50:08] approval. His approvals of any of us is
[1:50:12] only in the beloved. His love is
[1:50:14] elective which he had for us before the
[1:50:17] foundation of the world. Does he love
[1:50:19] us? The prophet says yes. How shall we
[1:50:22] know? We shall know because he said so
[1:50:25] and manifested. Manifest that he did
[1:50:28] love us. For he brought us to himself
[1:50:31] and gave us of his spirit placing us as
[1:50:33] sons. How shall I prove my love to God
[1:50:36] now? by believing what he said and by
[1:50:39] conducting myself with joy amidst the
[1:50:42] trials that he in his wisdom allows to
[1:50:45] pass. In other words, the trials that in
[1:50:48] his grace or election or fornowledge or
[1:50:52] predestination is allows to pass in
[1:50:55] order to try my faith. But I still trust
[1:50:57] him
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; because he loved me and his love is
[1:51:01] unconditional. Lord, make us master of
[1:51:04] circumstances.
[1:51:05] Why are we tossed to and fro? Why we are
[1:51:08] worried so much? Why? Because sometimes
[1:51:11] we allow the outside here to influence
[1:51:14] our inside but should be the inside
[1:51:17] influencing the outside.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Help us Lord.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; When Satan tempt us, we are to resist
[1:51:29] him with a perfect faith in a perfect
[1:51:32] love.
[1:51:33] Prophet says perfect faith is the master
[1:51:36] of all circumstances.
[1:51:38] Perfect faith masters all circumstances.
[1:51:40] No matter what it is, it masters it.
[1:51:43] Just watch when you believe anything, do
[1:51:45] anything or you got faith in what you
[1:51:47] are doing. No matter what the
[1:51:49] circumstance is, you don't have one
[1:51:51] thing to do with it. It masters that
[1:51:53] circumstance. If it's a room of sickness
[1:51:56] and the Lord revealed that this certain
[1:51:59] thing is going to happen, you just speak
[1:52:01] it and go on. Don't ask questions, it's
[1:52:05] already over. Just keep going. It
[1:52:07] masters all circumstances. Amen. Amen.
[1:52:11] Well, if you do this or that, it's going
[1:52:13] this and no, just it all got mastered.
[1:52:16] Amen. Faith believes what God that God
[1:52:20] will work it out. I don't know how it's
[1:52:23] going to do it, but you'll do it anyhow.
[1:52:25] It masters all circumstances.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Don't try to figure it out. Lord, I just
[1:52:31] trust you. I trust your word and I
[1:52:33] believe your word and I keep moving on.
[1:52:36] You know, in the millennium, Satan is
[1:52:38] going to be bound by the chain of
[1:52:40] circumstances because he won't have any
[1:52:43] place where he can work through. Now,
[1:52:46] the body is not redeemed yet. So he
[1:52:48] still has a channel here coming here and
[1:52:50] sometimes affect even our spiritual life
[1:52:53] and when you become weak because he
[1:52:55] still he still have circumstances that
[1:52:56] comes to affect us. But let me tell you
[1:52:59] in millennium he won't have that channel
[1:53:01] anymore. It will be bound here.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you when you have
[1:53:06] perfect faith this place he has no
[1:53:08] access. If those circumstances don't
[1:53:11] affect the inside anymore, you already
[1:53:14] living in a spiritual millennium in the
[1:53:16] soul because Satan has no access to the
[1:53:19] soul once we have perfect faith. You are
[1:53:22] the master of circumstances. I am sick
[1:53:25] but all is well.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, my children are not serving the
[1:53:28] Lord, but all is well. They will come
[1:53:30] back. My wife is not serving the Lord.
[1:53:32] Oh, they they will come back. My
[1:53:34] husband, oh no, don't worry. they will
[1:53:37] come back because the faith of God will
[1:53:39] believe all the word of God and I won't
[1:53:42] depend on the circumstances. I'll
[1:53:44] believe the word of God and keep
[1:53:46] confessing and keep moving on. Amen.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; That's where we are called up to you.
[1:53:50] Amen.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; And it's still the same yesterday,
[1:53:54] today, and forever.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Abraham had to wait for 25 years. But as
[1:54:00] he received the ministry of the son of
[1:54:02] man, he accepted it. I would tell you it
[1:54:04] happened. Amen. He had the son. Amen.
[1:54:07] The same thing for your circumstances.
[1:54:09] It will happen no matter what the enemy
[1:54:11] is trying to put there.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; Now think about the word of God. The
[1:54:18] what we have received our age. I'll be
[1:54:20] closing. Give me 10 minutes. The word
[1:54:22] operating in human flesh by physical
[1:54:25] signs, by material signs, by scriptural
[1:54:27] signs perfectly to bring to you a
[1:54:30] perfect faith for a perfect rapture. Why
[1:54:33] can't we look at it? Not a mystic. The
[1:54:35] prophet says the devil has put
[1:54:38] everything in the world before you to
[1:54:39] keep you keep you from believing it.
[1:54:43] He'll bring in a meeting and tried to
[1:54:45] throw everything he can in front of you.
[1:54:47] Shake it away from you. The Bible says
[1:54:50] rise and shake yourself.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; Pinch yourself. His spirit is here. He
[1:54:55] knows you.
[1:54:57] You've got one thing to do and that's to
[1:54:59] believe it, to accept it. He knows. You
[1:55:03] believe that? He knows what in you. He
[1:55:06] knows what you are. He knows what your d
[1:55:09] desire is. He knows what you have need
[1:55:12] of. Amen.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; God knows what the situation is. He
[1:55:16] knows what you're going on, what you're
[1:55:18] doing in your life. He says, is it
[1:55:20] wonderful to know that we don't have to
[1:55:21] take some human philosophy? We got a
[1:55:24] Bible here that speaks of it. Here is he
[1:55:27] is here he is to identify his church to
[1:55:31] give it rapturing faith to be taken
[1:55:33] away. How could a person ste sit still?
[1:55:37] We have everything to identify his
[1:55:40] church to give it rapturing faith to be
[1:55:42] taken away. Personally that's my
[1:55:45] personal now I'm putting my thought
[1:55:47] that's my person brother will talk about
[1:55:49] two category of people two category of
[1:55:52] believers. Some believers they don't
[1:55:55] have anything in the bank account but
[1:55:57] they will still want to buy things and
[1:56:00] oh no I think I have my bank is full and
[1:56:03] they will still buy try to buy things
[1:56:05] I'll say they're just borrowing they're
[1:56:07] just using a credit card but nothing
[1:56:09] behind that that the bank account is
[1:56:11] empty
[1:56:13] yeah and and and I I'll say the
[1:56:16] Pentecostal how in that group probably
[1:56:18] because they have also some great things
[1:56:20] and happening oh how come we don't have
[1:56:22] in the message. How come? Oh, they're
[1:56:24] just using the credit card. Nothing
[1:56:26] behind. They're moving on. But there
[1:56:28] also another category. They have
[1:56:30] everything. The bank account is full,
[1:56:33] but they don't know how to use the
[1:56:34] credit card. They don't have the PIN
[1:56:37] number
[1:56:39] or or they don't they think that there's
[1:56:41] nothing there. Maybe they still think
[1:56:43] that there's they don't they are not
[1:56:44] benefiting from what they have. And I
[1:56:47] think many Christians the message fall
[1:56:49] in that category where we think that we
[1:56:52] we we are nothing there is nothing but
[1:56:54] all heaven is behind us. The whole
[1:56:57] message came to confirm the whole heaven
[1:57:00] came to confirm that this message is the
[1:57:03] absolute is the truth. God himself Jesus
[1:57:07] Christ himself came down in the form
[1:57:10] that could be photographed to testify
[1:57:12] and confirm that this message is the
[1:57:15] truth. Let me tell you your bank account
[1:57:17] is full. Amen.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; Once you have the Holy Spirit, your bank
[1:57:21] account is full.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; You can just apply the pin. The pin
[1:57:25] number is the faith
[1:57:27] and faith is the key to open everything
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. I receive
[1:57:34] what I have need of because I'm a son of
[1:57:36] God. I have the seed of God. It's not me
[1:57:40] who called myself. God called me.
[1:57:42] Because I'm a son or daughter of God, I
[1:57:44] can use whatever I have need of.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; Don't belittle yourself. You are you
[1:57:51] have received the most precious and
[1:57:54] glorious message that could ever stack
[1:57:57] that could have struck the earth is the
[1:57:59] message of the hour.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; That's why the proverb say
[1:58:05] the same yesterday, today and forever.
[1:58:08] The manifestation of his spirit is
[1:58:10] catching away the bride. Let that faith
[1:58:13] revelation fall into the heart that this
[1:58:16] is the hour. We have received the
[1:58:19] message of the hour because it is the
[1:58:23] hour where we have to receive perfect
[1:58:25] faith. It's not another age. There won't
[1:58:28] be another age. This is the age. This is
[1:58:30] the season where we have to receive the
[1:58:33] perfect faith, rapturing faith.
[1:58:36] Prophet says to the Pentecostal church
[1:58:38] of this day, the restoration of the
[1:58:39] gift. May the Lord, those men, maybe
[1:58:42] some of them present here, some of them
[1:58:44] hearing the tape around the world, may
[1:58:46] they realize that this is the calling
[1:58:49] out of the bride. The message is the
[1:58:51] calling out of the bride, not a
[1:58:53] Pentecostal message. The Pentecostal
[1:58:55] message was to restore the gift back in
[1:58:57] the church to restore the gift and the
[1:59:00] worked on on these two spheres. But this
[1:59:03] is now the calling out of the bride, the
[1:59:05] soul. Amen. Says, but this is the
[1:59:08] calling for for the bride. another
[1:59:09] message that was to come just before
[1:59:12] Sodom was to be burned. Let them
[1:59:14] understand, dear God. He's praying that
[1:59:16] and that also my prayer. Lord, help us
[1:59:18] to understand
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; that this is the calling out of the
[1:59:21] bride. Not another church, but the
[1:59:23] calling out of the bride.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; Let the faith that has been released
[1:59:27] through the message drop into my heart
[1:59:29] now. This is the astronaut age. Amen.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; It's not it's not it's not a horse age.
[1:59:35] It's not the car. It's not even it's not
[1:59:37] even the airplane. It's the astronaut
[1:59:39] age. Let me go into those spheres of
[1:59:42] faith, Lord. Let me go deeper in my
[1:59:44] relationship with you, Lord. That's
[1:59:46] where I want to be, Lord. I want to be
[1:59:48] in that perfect faith and perfect love
[1:59:50] with you, Lord.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; That's where I desire to be.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Prophet says, remember the countdown
[1:59:57] says, remember they are powers. All were
[2:00:00] horrorowers. All of it is host power.
[2:00:03] The church is just moving up. The Holy
[2:00:05] Ghost power is the Holy Ghost that the
[2:00:07] justified is the same Holy Ghost but
[2:00:09] justified in the other ages is
[2:00:11] justified. The other ages is sanctified.
[2:00:13] The other ages gave the gift of the Holy
[2:00:15] Spirit. But it says in this age the Holy
[2:00:17] Ghost gives us rapturing faith as we
[2:00:21] move up. We are in the age for rapturing
[2:00:24] faith.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:26] It says, "I'm looking for a time for a
[2:00:28] breakthrough of the spirit of God in
[2:00:30] these last days that we are now living
[2:00:32] in for another surge of the Holy Spirit
[2:00:35] into the church for a rapturing faith."
[2:00:38] Lord, give us that surge of the Holy
[2:00:40] Spirit.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; We desire that surge of the Holy Spirit
[2:00:43] to give us rapturing faith.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; While we don't want to stay behind,
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; we don't want to be want to be the
[2:00:51] foolish virgin. No, we are called to be
[2:00:54] the the wise virgin to be those who
[2:00:57] receive the perfect faith, the rapturing
[2:00:59] faith because it here the third pool is
[2:01:01] here. The third pool has been identified
[2:01:04] says we are now at a time that the world
[2:01:07] should the word of God should have
[2:01:09] preeminence. That's why I have the
[2:01:12] preminence in my life. As I live, as I'm
[2:01:15] husband, as a father, as a as a mother,
[2:01:18] as a teenager, let the word of God have
[2:01:21] preminence your life.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Don't let the other things have
[2:01:24] preminence your life, controlling you,
[2:01:26] you know, leading you, become slaves of
[2:01:29] circumstances. Oh, I can't get out of
[2:01:31] this. Oh, this is too much on you. This
[2:01:33] is has power over you. Let me tell you,
[2:01:36] there is a solution. The Holy Spirit is
[2:01:38] here to give you power over anything
[2:01:40] that keeps to bind you, try to bind you
[2:01:42] in your mind, in your flesh. The Holy
[2:01:45] Spirit is here to give you free liberty.
[2:01:47] The Holy Spirit is here to give you
[2:01:49] freedom. The Holy Spirit to release you.
[2:01:51] Amen. It's here, the perfect love, the
[2:01:54] perfect faith. Amen. The Holy Spirit,
[2:01:57] the person of the Holy Spirit is here to
[2:01:59] give you that. Amen.
[2:02:03] I'll close with this.
[2:02:08] Sounds negative, but
[2:02:11] Matthew 7:21 says, "Not everyone saith
[2:02:14] unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into
[2:02:16] the kingdom of heaven, but he that said
[2:02:18] that doth the will of my father which is
[2:02:21] in heaven." Many will say to me on that
[2:02:23] day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied
[2:02:26] in thy name? Prophesied the sphere of
[2:02:30] the spirit. They have prophesied in thy
[2:02:33] name. In thy name have not cast out
[2:02:34] devils. They have a little bit of faith.
[2:02:36] In thy name have done many wonderful
[2:02:38] works. And then I will profess unto
[2:02:41] them, I never knew you. Depart from me.
[2:02:44] He that work iniquity. God will say
[2:02:46] without the Holy Sp without the third
[2:02:49] pool. Rejecting the third pool you are
[2:02:51] rejecting that relationship with God. I
[2:02:55] know you. I have a relationship with
[2:02:57] you. The Holy Ghost. The third pull
[2:03:00] comes to bring that relationship with
[2:03:03] God. That's what the message comes. The
[2:03:05] the me brother says the my my theme my
[2:03:08] my goal is to bring that relationship
[2:03:10] between each individual with God to
[2:03:14] restore that relationship. Oh Lord I
[2:03:17] don't want to miss that relationship
[2:03:18] with you. I don't want to be toward the
[2:03:20] bondage or consider the message as a law
[2:03:23] as a constraint or something to push me.
[2:03:25] No, I want that relationship. He's my
[2:03:27] husband. is my all in all. He has
[2:03:30] preeminence in my life. I want that
[2:03:32] relationship to be maintained. I want it
[2:03:35] to come from the inside to the outside.
[2:03:37] I will cast out devils. I will prophesy
[2:03:41] but I will do the will of God. What is
[2:03:43] the will of God? The will of God is to
[2:03:45] do to do the me to follow the message of
[2:03:49] the hour of your age. Amen.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; Let me put in a parenthesis we're
[2:03:53] talking about Abraham. Imagine Abraham
[2:03:55] had to follow the instructions of Noah
[2:03:57] when God said you know follow me and
[2:04:00] he's following the instruction of Noah
[2:04:02] that won't be the obedience that won't
[2:04:04] be the will of God for his age. Abraham
[2:04:06] had to follow the word of God for his
[2:04:09] age and show obedience to word of God
[2:04:12] for his age. The same thing for us. We
[2:04:15] is not just to be a Christians but Lord
[2:04:18] I want to be a Christians who is in the
[2:04:20] center of your will for my age. The
[2:04:23] message of the hour that has come Lord
[2:04:25] let me receive it from deep inside my
[2:04:27] soul.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; The prophet say the spirit can come out
[2:04:34] here and you to do certain things and
[2:04:36] you do it but it don't mean you are
[2:04:38] saved. Down there it says it's that
[2:04:40] inside soul that never dies. It's God
[2:04:42] eternal life. It's always eternal life.
[2:04:45] It come from God. It goes to God. That's
[2:04:48] the soul. So, but when it's directed
[2:04:51] from the inside, it draws all the rest
[2:04:54] of it together. That's the guidepost.
[2:04:56] That the control tower, the inside of
[2:04:58] the inside. The soul controls the
[2:05:00] spirit, the spirit controls the body.
[2:05:02] So, an outside what wash won't make any
[2:05:06] don't make any difference. them
[2:05:08] religious back there. So Paul called
[2:05:11] white world and so forth. He continued
[2:05:12] the reason I say people can jump and
[2:05:14] down and speak in tongues and people can
[2:05:16] shout and lay hands and heal the sick
[2:05:18] and by faith all these things by the
[2:05:20] spirit still be lost. That was why
[2:05:22] anointed ones. But let me tell you but
[2:05:24] when you have it from the inside to the
[2:05:26] outside you become like Abraham. Abraham
[2:05:30] by faith the Bible says Abraham by faith
[2:05:33] he looked at the things in a different
[2:05:35] way. As it is written, I made thee a
[2:05:38] father of many nations before him who
[2:05:40] you believed even God who quickened the
[2:05:42] dead and called those things which he be
[2:05:44] lost as though they were. Who against
[2:05:47] hope believed in hope that he might
[2:05:49] become the father of many nations
[2:05:51] according to that which was spoken shall
[2:05:54] he shall thy seed be. Are you with me?
[2:05:57] Don't I want to give me a few minutes.
[2:05:59] Being not weak in faith, he considered
[2:06:01] not his own body, now dead when he was
[2:06:05] about 100 years old, neither yet the
[2:06:08] deadness of Sarah's womb. He staggered
[2:06:11] not at the promise of God through
[2:06:13] unbelief, but was strong in faith,
[2:06:15] giving glory to God, being fully
[2:06:18] persuaded that what he has promised, is
[2:06:21] able also to perform. The prophet will
[2:06:25] take that that that scripture and says
[2:06:27] it wasn't even considered when it was
[2:06:30] revealed to him. That bed is not
[2:06:33] considered. You are paralytic. Whatever
[2:06:35] you are, it is not considered. The
[2:06:37] wheelchair is not cons is not under
[2:06:40] consideration for that little boy. Maybe
[2:06:43] paralyzed. Whatever it is, I don't know.
[2:06:45] It's not under consideration. Don't even
[2:06:48] consider it. The doctor said you'll
[2:06:51] never get out of here. The doctor said
[2:06:53] she'll never come out. That's not even
[2:06:56] considered. Well, look, it's an old
[2:06:58] person in a middle age. That's not even
[2:07:01] considered. Abraham seed coming forth in
[2:07:04] the last days to shine like the stars.
[2:07:07] Let me tell you, you should not have you
[2:07:09] have received the third pool. Don't
[2:07:11] consider what the other thing says. You
[2:07:14] take what the word of God says. As it
[2:07:17] was for Abraham, he did not consider how
[2:07:19] dry was the womb of of Sarah, how dead
[2:07:23] his body was, he did not take that under
[2:07:25] consideration for the situation you
[2:07:28] might be going on. No matter how dry it
[2:07:30] is, no matter how the family is dry, no
[2:07:33] matter how your husband looks dead, no
[2:07:35] matter how your children looks dead,
[2:07:38] look dead. No matter how your wife look,
[2:07:41] don't put that under consideration. You
[2:07:44] have to consider the word of God. You
[2:07:47] have to consider the promise of God. You
[2:07:49] have to pro consider what God has done
[2:07:52] for you and the promise that God has
[2:07:54] given you, you will have the victory.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; Don't even consider your mistakes. Oh,
[2:08:00] can I make the rapture? Oh, no. If you
[2:08:03] are born again and you believe the
[2:08:05] message of the hour, don't consider your
[2:08:07] mistakes. Look at the word of God.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; I keep pressing on. I'll be part of the
[2:08:13] rapture. Amen.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Amen.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; Brother of Jesus Christ, let's give the
[2:08:17] Lord a hand this morning.
[2:08:20] [Applause]
[2:08:24] Amen.
[2:08:26] Amen.
[2:08:30] Amen.
[2:08:31] When the world the roll is going up,
[2:08:34] I'll be there.
[2:08:50] When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound
[2:08:54] and time shall be no. And the morning
[2:08:58] breaks eternal bright and fair.
[2:09:02] When the saved on earth shall gather
[2:09:05] over on the other shore and the roll is
[2:09:10] called up yonder, I'll be there.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; When the roll
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; When the roll
[2:09:17] is called up yonder.
[2:09:21] When the roll
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; is called up yonder.
[2:09:27] When the roll
[2:09:30] is called up yonder.
[2:09:34] Oh,
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; when the roll is called up yonder, I'll
[2:09:38] be there
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; on that bright and cloudless morning.
[2:09:44] When the dead in Christ shall rise, and
[2:09:48] the glory of his resurrection share,
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; when his chosen one shall gather to
[2:09:57] their homes beyond the sky, and the roll
[2:10:01] is called up yonder, I'll be there.
[2:10:06] When the road
[2:10:08] is called up yonder.
[2:10:12] When the road
[2:10:14] is called up yonder.
[2:10:18] When the roll
[2:10:21] is called up yonder
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; when the roll is called up yonder. I'll
[2:10:29] be there.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; Let us labor.
[2:10:32] Let us labor for the master from the
[2:10:36] dawn till setting sun. Let us talk of
[2:10:40] all his wondous love and care.
[2:10:44] Then when all of life is over and our

[2:20:43] And the scripture says, "Go all all over
[2:20:46] the world,
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; preach the the good news.
[2:20:52] I go to all five continents,
[2:20:56] to preach the word of God.
[2:20:59] I went through Spain.

[2:21:51] if you have you have been a son of God
[2:21:53] since you come on earth
[2:21:57] even you be even if you become
[2:22:02] even if you have a bad life like that
[2:22:04] woman Samaritan
[2:22:07] when she met
[2:22:09] she became back to what she was
[2:22:13] in heaven anywhere
[2:22:15] and you come on earth,
[2:22:18] you take a a holiness that has been
[2:22:21] manufactured.
[2:22:23] [Music]
[2:22:25] You do the what's against
[2:22:28] you don't have the true love
[2:22:30] [Music]
[2:22:32] as the prophet says
[2:22:35] to forgive your enemy.
[2:22:37] That's love.
[2:22:40] able
[2:22:42] to forgive the one who tried against
[2:22:45] you.
[2:22:47] That's why Paulist
[2:22:50] insist

[2:22:52] it says Jesus
[2:22:55] the mediator of the new covenant
[2:22:59] and the precious blood
[2:23:02] that speak that speaking better
[2:23:05] than the blood of Abel.
[2:23:10] Abel was still pointing to the evil
[2:23:14] that he killed me.
[2:23:18] He will point to his brother.
[2:23:25] He's speaking
[2:23:33] father.
[2:23:46] May God bless brother Moses.
