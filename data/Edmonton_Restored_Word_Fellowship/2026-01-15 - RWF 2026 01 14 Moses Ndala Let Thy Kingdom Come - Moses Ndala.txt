Summary of the Sermon: “Let Thy Kingdom Come”
Introduction
In this sermon entitled “Let Thy Kingdom Come,” Brother Moses expounds on the prayer taught by Jesus Christ in Matthew 6:9–10, drawing attention to its deep spiritual meaning rather than treating it as a memorized ritual. He emphasizes that this prayer reveals a believer’s relationship with God, not as a distant deity to be feared, but as a loving Father who desires intimacy with His children. From the opening moments, the sermon establishes that prayer is rooted in revelation—knowing who God is and knowing who we are in Him. Brother Moses reminds the congregation that believers are needy by design, so that God’s attributes may be manifested in their lives, and that recognizing our need is not weakness but spiritual honesty (cf. Matthew 6:11; Hebrews 4:16).

Brother Moses focuses strongly on the phrase “Our Father,” explaining that calling God Father requires a revelation of sonship. Drawing from Romans 8:15 and Galatians 4:6, he teaches that believers have not received a spirit of fear or bondage, but the Spirit of adoption, whereby they cry, “Abba, Father.” This adoption is not merely positional but experiential—coming to maturity in Christ. Referencing Brother William Branham’s teachings, he highlights that believers possess the “Gene of God,” meaning they share God’s divine nature as sons and daughters, expressing His attributes in their lives. As Brother Branham taught in Christ Is the Mystery of God Revealed, the sons of God are not trying to become something; they are manifesting what they already are by predestination. Thus, prayer becomes an expression of confidence and relationship, not fear, guilt, or uncertainty.

The sermon then turns to the nature of the Kingdom of God, connecting Jesus’ words in Luke 17:21—“The kingdom of God is within you”—with the believer’s daily walk. Brother Moses ...

You can give a testimony right now, brother, because then we can praise the Lord together, right? And thank him for his goodness. He left me this alone. So that's why I'm doing it today. Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord is faithful. Very, very faithful. &gt;&gt; So, on my way early for church today, &gt;&gt; so I thought and I was driving down white mud and suddenly the wheel caught some snow on the side. I just didn't see it. There was lights ahead. So, I got pulled onto the boulevard on top of the snow &gt;&gt; and I'm trying to get over to get because there's another it's a exit and then there's the white mud &gt;&gt; and I'm trying to get and I'm stuck. I'm hung up. I'm on top of the world, the snow world, and not happy because I couldn't move. Like the tires made ice and I couldn't go forward. Forward. So I said, "Well, what will I do?" I tried hacking. I had a little scraper and I worked on that till it broke. I said, "Okay, now what?" I started talking to the Lord. I say, "This is something. What are you doing here?" Right? And so I said, "Well, I could call my roadside assistants." And uh I did and they said, "Well, we'll come in five hours." &gt;&gt; I said, "You don't understand." She's this woman in in Ontario. She says, "Um, yeah, I'm sorry. That's the best we can do. They're all stuck in the alleys helping people out of the the weather there." I said, "It's 10 degrees above." Well, I don't know, but we just can't five hours. I said, "Brother Andrew, Brother Joseph." So I I gave them a text each and they got in touch and they come down. They're going to come. I had toll ropes. I couldn't budge and so uh I was stuck there waiting and it was just about4 to 6 when it started and they came finally around whenever I called after I tried my exhausted my own efforts and in the meanwhile I was talking to the Lord said you know Lord it'd be pretty easy for you to just send somebody with a truck. I thought brother Joseph had one but he doesn't anymore. So, um, I continued to wait and lo and behold, all of a sudden, a young man named Abby and Indian descent truck, tires on the truck, half ton, he's got to ropes. Yeah, we can do this. We hooked it up and out we came. &gt;&gt; So, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And what an answer to prayer because uh the Lord is able to do these little things for us. And it was more than a little because I couldn't be late for church. I'm here today. So, and I told this guy, his name is Abby. I said, and u very fine, like the Lord sent him. &gt;&gt; It's amazing. I said he helped us out over there. Joseph, brother Andrew didn't have to, you know, so he had the the other goods. The Lord owns everything anyway. So, praise God. Thank you. Be joyful with me. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Isn't the Lord wonderful? Praise the Lord. Let's just open up in prayer and thank him this this evening hour. Father in heaven, we're so grateful for the testimony of brother brother Peter's Lord Jesus. How you helped him out. It may seem so little, but Lord, you were you care care for the sparrows, Lord. As I'm watching out the window, Lord, you care for every sparrow, Lord, that's hungry and they're just coming around our feeder, Lord. And you feed them through our hands and you feed them otherwise in different ways. And Lord Jesus, we're more than sparrows. And brother is more than a sparrow, Lord. And you had your mind upon him to to show him that you're still real, that you're still Jehovah, the provider, the Jehovah Gyra, the Lord that provides all our needs, Lord. And I thank you, Lord Jesus, for our brother Peter, Lord Jesus, that you have sent to us to to play the piano for us. And Lord, I thank you for everyone.

I'm just remembering Brother Victor over there in in in Ontario. Lord Jesus, oh God, his mother was sick. I heard I read that on the internet. She was sick. She wasn't able to speak. But Lord, you caused her to speak again, Lord. And you're restoring her, Lord. And I pray that you'd bless that family, Lord. and use them mightily. Lord, I pray for brother Luke Freeman. Lord Jesus, I pray that you would save his soul and make him Lord God what he ought to be. Lord, a son of God. And may you heal his body as well. In the name of Jesus, Lord, you came Lord. You paid the price for our salvation and for our healing. And Lord Jesus, Matthew, Lord God, sister Claudia's son, Lord, oh God in heaven, you see him as he is, Lord Jesus, he needs a touch from heaven. Lord Jesus, I I pray that you would not let him rest. Lord, I until he seeks you and finds you, Lord Jesus. It's We don't want him to be anxious, but Lord, we want him to be so restless until he finds that peace, that peace that passes all human understanding. So, I pray, oh God, that you would speak. Doesn't matter how you do it, Lord, just bring him in again, oh Lord, the whole family, Lord. Daniel and and what's the other ones? Juan. Yeah, John. We call him Juan. Lord, I pray that you would be with that whole family. Brother will too, Lord. You see the different needs, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. We bring them all before you in Jesus' name. I pray, Brother Terren, Lord, he hasn't shown his face for maybe for weeks and weeks, Lord. I pray that you would speak to his heart, to his children, his boys. Oh God, I don't know what has happened, but Lord Jesus, may you come on the scene and touch his life. Lord, you you brought him in here, Lord Jesus, for a purpose. May that purpose not be wasted. But may, oh God, you speak to his heart. And we'll give all the praise and all the honor, Lord. Those that couldn't be here tonight, may you bless them, Lord. Bless them and put it in the heart that they may come and be with us, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah to thy wonderful name, the name of Jesus.

Father, one more time, we bow our head be our heads before you Lord as the prophet say many times our nose turning bowing towards the earth this flesh come from father but our heart are turning towards heaven Lord towards you because we are connected to you father Lord we love you and appreciate you. Thank you for another opportunity Lord to be in the house of Lord together with believers each one bringing the le of fire but also father to have fellowship with you lord we appreciate you thank you for the testimonies thank you father lord for restoring the health of pastor Zigg sister Anita different ones father lord we thank you for your grace and your mercy lord you are the only healer lord we love you and appreciate you the healing virtue is still working on &gt;&gt; let your name be praised Lord Remember those who are sick, those who are still weak in the flesh. Father, we also send the word of God towards their place where they are. Father, may they be restored, may they be touched, Father. &gt;&gt; Lord, as you are touching us this evening, may also touch them over there, Lord. We pray, &gt;&gt; Lord, we are expecting great time in your presence, through the the the worship. So through father prayer, through the word of God, help us, Father, as we desire a closer walk with you. We give you the glory and the honor, Lord. Bless your word in our heart. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give a Wednesday time of prayer. So just go to the word of God. Thank you, brothers and brother Joseph. just invite you to go to Matthew 6 9:10. We don't necessarily need to read it, but we have to read it because my opening scripture, but Matthew chapter 6 9:10 says after this moment. So after this manner therefore pray ye our father which which art in heaven. Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless his word. They just have a sit on a day of a time of prayer as a we have different needs. How many are needs are need have a need in their heart? Lord, I have a need. Myself, I have a need. All have needs and we are needy people. But we have a God who answers to prayers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was fellowshipping with someone said, "Why do you have so many needs?" Say, "Yeah, that that's what that's good." If you have so many needs because God did not come for those who didn't have any need. He comes for those who have a need. that where his attribute has been will be manifested to show who is God. So we it's good sometimes to have needs so that it shows and and to recognize that we have needs. Some have needs but they don't recognize that they have needs. But as we are not we don't have that spirit of leicia that say I don't I don't need you. I don't need God. But we need God constantly all the time &gt;&gt; and we desire just him to be manifest in our lives. I would like to call this a little bit subject. Let thy kingdom come. Let thy kingdom come. A little bit of just parenthesis of what we touched on on on Sunday. Let thy king let that let thy kingdom come. Here Jesus Christ is teaching his disciples how to pray. You know they're wondering how to pray and John the Baptist has taught his disciples how to pray. How come we you don't teach us how to pray? I said no. Then he told them this is the way you have to pray. This is the manner. Not necessarily exactly the same words but it has to follow a bit the same structure and you see the importance is putting and if you have really go through it and each one I remember when I was a student I was in Ontario and I went to one brother there in his church and he took he took a series just on this prayers. He went on each word and each sentence. So just wonderful how we how we can grasp out of that prayer see many things that related to to what God has unveiled. But one just thought here Jesus says you start by saying our father you call God our father it's not just by calling God as our father just by the expression as our father Jesus Christ actually himself said don't call anybody father because there is only one father one true father and is is our lord Jesus Christ is god himself but as you call god our father you need to have also revelation of what is really being our father if he's our father and you come as a father. You go to God's prayer says I'm coming to God as my father. &gt;&gt; You don't come to God as as as as a as a master of slaves. No, you come to God we have a relationship between father and son, father and daughter. You don't come to God with fear. You don't come God trembling. You don't want God wondering whether he loves you or not. No. A real parent loves his children. And the children as they come they know that as they're coming to ask for a prayer ask for this request my father loves me he's going to give me the best he's going to give me the best so Jesus emphasizing you call him our father Amen if he's our father there is a relationship amen it's not just saying that I say just to say by by saying but because if you call him the father means he has begotten you he has given you life he's the one who has given you life so you have recognize that the the the nature of the father is also your nature. Amen. &gt;&gt; If God is our father is of the same nature. If you see in the animal kingdom, even human kingdom, you see animal kingdom, a lion gives it to a little lion. If you see the fish and you give a fish, we don't change the spaces species, right? If God gives give birth to a son, that that son is also a small god. &gt;&gt; He's alo the same nature as God. He has all the attribute of God in that little in that in maybe in a small the small amount but he has the same nature as God. As we recognize that we become more and more and more and more and more uh more and more acquainted with it and we have more revelation of it. It has to become life in our lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; You say if he's a father it means that you have the same characteristic. You have the seed genes of your father. Prophet said in things that are to be said, that's where we are. We have become from mortal beings from time beings to eternal beings. When the word of God lit our souls and we become sons and daughters of God with the attribute, the gene of God in us to be sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; The genes is manifesting a certain attribute. The gene is the gene manifest a certain attribute. Every cell has different genes. They have different genes and different different characteristic different attribute. Each one of us is expressing a certain attribute of God. &gt;&gt; Each one of us is expressing certain characteristic of God. So if you come in prayer, you come with revelation, you realize that you are expressing God's nature. You are expressing what God is. If God is forgiving, you are forgiving. If God is full of love, you are full of love. If God is is not worried, you don't you will not get worried. Amen. God has peace. You have peace. God is shalom. You have shalom. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because what God is, you are too. YOU EXPRESSING GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD is our father. &gt;&gt; It's hard to we take it for granted. But that's the the the religious people the old religions have they're fearing God know like in India they have their god even to have a relationship with their god no how can he be my father no he's he's way above god certainly they their god are not even true god they're just idols &gt;&gt; but that respect that have they can't just re be related to their god their god is way here there they are way here but our god Indeed, he was way here. But his his purpose is to get close to us &gt;&gt; as a true sons and daughter of God. Actually to the same God who put his nature, the divine nature into you. &gt;&gt; So that the worshipper and God himself have the same nature. &gt;&gt; The soul that is inside of you has the nature of God himself. &gt;&gt; It's not something else. Amen. You don't want to make yourself a son of God. You are son of God because of the gene of God inside of you before the foundation of the world. It says to be sons and daughters of God. God in heaven crying aba father my god and my god in my father's house. So you come from god you have the same you have the same nature of god. You are called unto adoption. You are not you are not you don't believe the message of the hour just to be just to be a nominal Christians. You are called unto adoption. You have a function you have to do. You have a purpose you have to do. You have to be after the father father's business. That's what the revelation of calling co of calling god your father. Calling god our father. Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans 8:15 says I will read a little of scriptures here. I don't I don't intend to take too long but just a few scriptures. Romans 8:15 says, "For we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but we have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, aba, father." &gt;&gt; We don't cry unto God by fear. So no Lord, I'm so afraid. I'm so scared. If this happen, if this happen, this happen. No, God, let thy will be done &gt;&gt; as it is in heaven. Let it be done on the same thing on earth. Your perfect will is always the best, Lord. I'm trusting in you. I'm relying on your grace. I'm trusting in your the word of God. It might take time, but father, I know that your will is always the perfect will. Is always the perfect thing for me. Amen. I don't want permissive will. I want your perfect will. Let your kingdom come. Let you yourself have the preminence. Lord, may you the one be dominating in my life. I want you to have the dominion upon my life. You have not received a spirit of fear, a spirit of trembling, a spirit of of of of being all the time afraid. No, God is saying you the fear no longer defines our standing with God. You don't serve God by fear of hell. You don't serve God by fear of punishment. No, you have to go a little bit further than that. It has to be the perfect love of God. It has to be the reality of God IN OUR HEART. AMEN. LET THAT BE OUR PRAYER. LORD, I want to serve you because I love you so much. &gt;&gt; Increase the love inside of my heart. Amen. Maybe we don't know Sunday. The love of God. The love is the most powerful most powerful virtue. I call it virtue that God can give you human because God is love himself. &gt;&gt; With love you can you can do anything if you love someone. You can do anything. If if just if brotherly kindness, brotherly love could bring a mother to go into fire to bring the baby. How much more our God with agapa love has expressed his love. HE CAME DOWN TO OUR PLACE. HE TOOK US FROM THE PLACE WHERE we were. He even BECAME SIN. NOT JUST BORE our sins, but he became sin IN ORDER TO TAKE us from that place. Amen. &gt;&gt; The love of God. Amen. If you have the love of God, let me tell you, you can conquer. Brother says, "How how do I cast those enemies? How do I cast the devils? Is it because of of strong words?" And no, it's because of the love of God inside of my heart. &gt;&gt; How can I conquer animals? Because I have the love of God inside of my heart. With love of God, you can you no one can hurt you and you can't hurt anybody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we have not received a spirit of bondage again to fear but we have received a spirit of adoption whereby we cry aba father because we are not under slavery anymore. We are we are not prisoners anymore but we are sons and not only sons not only baby sons but sons of god called onto adoption become mature they know who they are they have that stability they are established in the truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; A sons of God who is adopted knows who he is. He knows that what belong to my father belongs to me as well. He takes care of the father's business. We and the father business that we have is the is the word of God for our time. YOU YOU YOU APPLY THE WORD OF GOD. YOU CARE ABOUT THE WORD OF GOD. LORD, I WANT THAT SPIRIT of adoption to be working IN MY LIFE. I DON'T WANT THE SPIRIT OF FEAR. I don't want the fear of spirit of bondage, but I want the spirit of the love of God in my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we approach God as father, not as a judge. We don't approach God as a judge. Though God is a judge, but he's a judge, but he's also our attorney. He's also our advocate. He's our mediator. Amen. The prophet will say then the case is settled. &gt;&gt; The case is SETTLED BECAUSE THE JUDGE AND THE ATTORNEY IS THE SAME PERSON. &gt;&gt; He comes as the word of God and says that because of what you have done by the the word of God, you are being condemned by the same God. Because you have said, "Lord, forgive me. The blood of Jesus Christ has wiped away your sins and you are declared sinless in the PRESENCE OF GOD. NOW HE'S DEFENDING YOU. SAY THAT my son, that my daughter. &gt;&gt; I like that expression. You cannot perish as God cannot perish. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you have the same spirit at work in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; First 2 Timothy 1:7 says, "For God has not given us the spirit of fear, but the spirit of power, the spirit of love, the spirit of a sound mind." We have received the spirit of power, the power of the Holy Ghost is still working in the church. God, give me more of your power. Give me more of the love of God. And let me have a sound mind. Not fear, but a sound mind. making the right decision with serenity, with peace, knowing that God is in control. Amen. Not going in a rush, not making a huh decisions in a in a in in harsh, but just believing in God word and taking it as his word. In other words, fear says, "I hope God accepts me or God God will receive me one day. I hope this. I hope this." No. The spirit of God INSIDE OF YOU BEAR witness to what the word of God says. The spirit inside of us bears witness that we are sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; How? Because the same spirit that was in Jesus Christ, the same spirit inside of us. &gt;&gt; Our Lord Jesus, how do you come? Our father which are in heaven. Heaven is just a dimension and heaven is now in our heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; How do you remove fear? You remove fear by the capstone, the perfect love. 1 John 4:18 says, "There is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth all out fear because fear had torment. He that fear is not made perfect in love." So we thank God for the perfect love of God. Love cast out the fear. &gt;&gt; But I'm you know Job Job was fearing many things. Don't fear that this happen if this happen this happen. So fear is the worst enemy. It's the worst curse that can be upon the church is that fear &gt;&gt; that worries. So what is this? What about this? What about this? What about this? And you create your own negativity too much. But there is no negativity in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Don't worry too much. Amen. That God I just put I I cast all my burden at your feet and I trust you. Leave it there and trust him. Amen. Just trust him because you are son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Instead of fear, believers receive the adoption, the spirit of adoption. Adoption in the Bible as the prophet would say is when you come to the full maturity is a place where you know that you are a son not of God. That what belongs to the father also belongs to you. Amen. It you have you have always been a son but there's a time where you realize that I am a son. Amen. &gt;&gt; That I am a daughter of God. You have always been there, but you have to come to the place where you realize who you are really are. When the bride recognize who she is, then the rapture will go. It's a matter of God. GIVE ME MORE revelation to know who I am, what I'm standing in the vision IN A BIG PLAN OF redemption and take all the fear away. Lord, give me more of your love &gt;&gt; rather than fear. That's why we cry with intimacy, aba father. Aba father. The prophet says as the eagles to up their nees, nothing will move you. On this I will build my church, says Jesus. And the gates of hell can't prevail against it. Nothing will never move it. It the unmovable rock of God's eternal word. Right in the hours of death, even when all hope is gone, a born child of God can take his stand on God's eternal word and look yonder beyond these tears and say to look to him and said, "I am the resurrection and life." Even death is itself will never shake them. They are eagles. They're heavenborn birds. Their nature in them is designed to believe that and to trust it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Galatians 4:6 says, "And because you are sons, God has sent forth the spirit of his son onto your hearts crying, aba father." As we cry, we as we come and pray, this crying doesn't mean that you are crying and crying, but it means you you are yearning and coming to the Lord, you are my father, I trust in you. You are my father. There is a relationship between you and me. I'm not just a religious person. And if I am Lord change me from the the churchity to have a relationship of love with you Lord that I recognize my position the family of God. I am your son. I am your daughter. Take away the fear of punishment. Take away the fear of rejection. Take away the fear of condemnation. I even if you have repented of your sins that fear of condemnation should not be there anymore. You should come and take part in the promise of God. Why sometimes we don't get the benefit? Why we don't get the benefit of redempt of what the redemption have have brought to us on Calvary? Because we are constantly under the spirit of fear, under the spirit of condemnation, under the fear of guilt. Even though sometimes we have confessed our sin, but the enemy comes and reminds us and then we we we tend to agree with what the enemy is saying. SATAN IS ALWAYS A LIAR. AMEN. BUT YOU STAND UPON THE WORD OF GOD. I have already confessed. Amen. And and I'm standing AND I'M MOVING ON. PROPHET SAYS WE DIE DAILY. AMEN. WE DIE DAILY. We vaccinate daily. But there is something keeps holding you. SOMETHING KEEP PUSHING YOU. WHAT'S THAT? THE SPIRIT OF GOD. SPIRIT OF POWER. SPIRIT OF LOVE. &gt;&gt; AND A SOUND MIND. THANK GOD. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Now Luke 17:21. Neither shall they say lo here lo there lo behold the kingdom of god is within you. So it looks like a little bit how do you say how do you say oh god let the kingdom come and then god says the kingdom of god is within you. I believe as I said on Sunday, I believe what you have received that little stone of revelation that you have received in your heart, it has to grow. It has to become it has to become the one that is dominating our heart, our lives. Not not walking by sight, not walking by our feelings, but walking with faith. Amen. That faith has to increase. That reality, the Holy Spirit even inside of us has to increase, has to grow. It has to grow and we has to come down. We have to die more and let the Holy Spirit take full dominion, full control over our lives. Lord, Father, give me more of the Holy Spirit. Give me more of the revelation. Make me more sincere. Help me to die to myself that Christ have the full dominion upon my life. &gt;&gt; And if there is any need, if there is any need, and we have a lot of needs. We are coming to God with full confidence. Lord, I'm not coming with a with a slavery mentality, with a beggar mentality. No, like prophet says, like that little fish in the middle of the ocean. I I can't ask too much because I don't know if he's able to provide to this. I'm I'm scared. BUT NO, GOD IS MORE THAN ABLE TO PROVIDE TO ALL OUR NEED. THERE'S NOTHING IMPOSSIBLE to whoever believes. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU JUST ACCEPT THE WORD OF GOD. GOD, I TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD. OTHERS MIGHT NOT HAVE THE SAME REVELATION BUT YOU KEEP PRESSING ON LIKE THAT WOMAN WITH THE BLOOD ISSUE NEVER DONE IN THE PAST BUT SAYS IF I TOUCH THAT THE HEM OF HIS GARMENT I KNOW I'M GOING TO BE HEALED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SHE HAD A PERSONAL REVELATION AND SHE COMES AND SHE TOUCH AND SOMETHING HAPPENED. &gt;&gt; GOD THANK YOU LORD BECAUSE YOU ARE STILL THE SAME GOD TODAY. THE SAME HIGH PRIEST WHO CAN BE TOUCHED BY THE FEELING OF OUR INFIRMITIES. HE IS OUR FATHER. HE IS OUR FATHER. IF THE NATURAL FATHER DOESN'T WANT HIS CHILDREN to be hurting, if he has the means to provide to the TO THEIR NEEDS, HOW MUCH MORE OUR HEAVENLY father &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Proverb says, look away to Jesus. The Messiah is the word. The word. And the Bible says in Hebrews 4th chapter say the word of God is quicker more powerful than a two-edged sword getting even a sound the born of a discern of the thought that in the heart and when she know that Messiah was he was was to be that word made manifest and could tell her what was wrong with her that woman at the well she know that was Messiah. If she knew that there was Messiah today we know that the word we have received is also the Messiah. If he's a messiah, it means he has a kingdom and we are part of that kingdom. Amen. In type, Israel possess the kingdom, the kingdom of the the land by conquering a small by small steps. But God was with them. Amen. The same as with today. We want to claim our inheritance. We got to claim what we we if if if God drops in your heart a revelation for healing, a revelation for your children, a revelation for for for job, a revelation for for for a deeper, a closer walk with God. Whatever is in the need, God drops a revelation your heart. Let me tell you, continue claiming that. Continue fighting for it. Lord, this is my inheritance. I am a son AND DAUGHTER OF GOD. THIS MY INHERITANCE. I'M NOT GOING to let the devil take it away from me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prophet says Christ the mystery of God. First to express the three-fold purpose. First to express himself completely God in Christ. Second to have the preeminences by this in his church which is his body the bride till till he could have the preeminence to express himself through them. It's the time we are living in. And thirdly, to restore the kingdom to its rightfully position. Rightly position that fell by sin by the first Adam back to where he walke off in the cool of the evening with his people, talked with them and fellowshipped with them. And we are looking forward s we're looking forward to that time where the the kingdom of God will fully be restored in the physical and the spiritual fully restored. But today that kingdom is being restored in our soul. Amen. and say the kingdom is already in your heart and we want that kingdom to be fully restored completely in our heart where we have a personal and direct fellowship with God direct connection with our father seed gene of God only the prophet could tell that we are we are the seed gene of God MEANS WE ARE PART OF GOD HIMSELF WE ARE NOT different from from God if we're not separated from God we are &gt;&gt; THE SE GENE OF GOD AMEN AMEN. &gt;&gt; AS WE WERE IN HIM, WE WERE THE THOUGHT OF GOD NOW BEING EXPRESSED. THE GENE THAT WAS IN GOD NOW being expressed. &gt;&gt; Now we come to God with that faith, with that revelation. Lord, I'm bringing my family to you because you are my father, &gt;&gt; my heavenly father. &gt;&gt; Lord, I have this problem in this body, BUT YOU ARE MY FATHER. YOU ARE the one who loves me more than anything else. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are living in a time of full inheritance. The full manifestation of sons and daughters of God, not partial manifestation, full manifestations. So that what we are the age we are living in. Why? We we are living in a king. The kingdom is being restored. And we have as as Abraham met the king, you know, Abraham met mec &gt;&gt; the king of Salem. He met me, king of Salam. The prophet said now he has been looking for that kingdom, for that city where the maker and the builder is God himself because he met me. He knows that that city exists. Can't have a king of a city without without having. So he's looking for that king. But now the prophet come says and preaching who is this mech? No. Who was that meedc? Who he is this Melkisedc? So now we can meet THE SAME MELKISEDC TOO. AND WE HAVE met the Melkisedc. And that's why WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT CITY TOO. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND GOD gave him in his inheritance. He gave him a portion of that kingdom. But now today the mercy THAT THEY COME BACK SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THE FULL KINGDOM OF GOD BEING RESTORED. NOW &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR LIVING IN THIS LAST AGE. &gt;&gt; MOSES WOULD HAVE LOVED TO BE LIVE IN THIS EARTH. ABRAHAM WOULD HAVE LOVED TO BE LIVING IN THIS AGE. JOHN THE BAPTIST WOULD HAVE LOVED TO BE LIVING IN THIS AGE. BUT YOU AND I, WE ARE LIVING IN THE MOST GLORIOUS AGES OF all the ages. Amen. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHERE GOD NOW NOT IN THE DISPENSATION OF THE FATHER, not in the dispensation of the son, but God in the dispensation of the HOLY GHOST USING YOUR BODY, USING YOUR MIND, USING YOUR PECULARITY, MY PECULARITY TO EXPRESS HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD IS OUR FATHER. AMEN. &gt;&gt; LORD, let your kingdom come &gt;&gt; in our soul, in our mind, in our being, &gt;&gt; just living as citizen of that kingdom, having control what was done. Moses saw the plan of God in heaven. &gt;&gt; And God agreed with what he was doing because what he saw in heaven has been duplicated on earth. AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD LOVED THE offering of Abel because it was representing the lamb of God was slain before the foundation of the world. What was done in heaven now has been duplicated on earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; We God approved the temple of Solomon because it was a part according to a pattern OF HEAVEN. NOW GOD WANTS EVERYTHING THAT HAVE BEEN NOW OUR PRAYER IS THE SAME THING. GOD WE DON'T WANT OUR own pattern. We don't want our own will. We want WHAT IS DONE IN HEAVEN. WHAT HAS BEEN FOR AND PREDESTINATED BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. WE WANT THAT TO BE FULFILLED IN OUR LIVES. AMEN. NOT A PERMISSIVE WILL BUT YOUR PERFECT WILL LORD FOR YOUR GLORY LORD MAKE ME JUST AVAILABLE TO FULFILL YOUR WORD LORD KEEP ME IN THE CHANNEL OF THE WORD OF GOD KEEP ME IN THE CHANNEL OF THE PLAN OF REDEMPTION. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Proverb says we have he received you know the story he received. I'm almost there. He received the sword of of of of the king. He says it fit my hand so perfectly. That sword of the king says no. Uh it's not it's not it's not a sword of a king. It's the sword of the king. &gt;&gt; The king of kings, the lord of lords. &gt;&gt; And that sword he gave it to the prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, it did not stop only with the prophet. The prophet got that and he gave that to us. Amen. We can use the same sword of the king of kings to cut the unbelief, to cut sickness, to remove negativity. WE WE HAVE THE SAME SWORD OF THE WORD OF GOD TO CUT ANYTHING. AMEN. THE BIBLE SAID USE THAT SWORD TO CUT THE PROMISE OF GOD BELONGS TO YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR THE SWORD OF THE WORD OF GOD. NOT A CERTAIN KING BUT THE KING OF KING HAS GIVEN US THE SWORD FOR OUR DEFENSE FOR OUR DEFENSE IN THIS AGE OF &gt;&gt; LAIA. &gt;&gt; MOTHERS YOU CAN USE THE SWORD. AMEN. FATHERS YOU CAN USE THE SWORD. YOUNG CHILDREN YOU CAN USE THE SWORD OF THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; IT IS WRITTEN. It is written. It is written. YOU CAN DEFEAT SATAN ANYTIME, ANY PLACE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BY THE WORD OF GOD. SPEAK THE WORD OF GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND MOVE ON. &gt;&gt; Glory to his name. &gt;&gt; Says in the message Christ the mystery of God says our headship is the kingdom. The kingdom of God is within you. Say the Bible Jesus the kingdom. We are not a denomination. We belong to a kingdom. And the kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in our own life, bringing to pass every promise in this day as it did in that day when the word and God was one. And the word and God is one in his church today, making it the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message in the last day and be taken up from the dead in the resurrection to go back and restore again as Adam and Eve in the beginning in the garden of Eden the three-fold mystery of God, his body and the prophecies. Oh my. Oh, let me just put a comment here. The healing might be just you read in the in the word of God says, "Oh, by your stripes I'm healed." And it is written here. But now we want what is written here to become a revelation in the heart. Say, "Lord, I now want the word of God, as you say, the kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in his own life." Yeah, it is the word of God. But I want this word of God to become life inside of me. To become reality inside of me. Let the word of God made the spirit and life inside of me. Let thy kingdom come. Now, Lord, let the word of God become reality inside of me. Father, spiritually speaking says, now if this my comment, if you are still bound to sin, the word says you are free. As long as it stays in letter form, it is not yet your kingdom. But God wants it to become your kingdom. He wants it to become your property. He want to become your place of your domain. Becomes part of you. The promise of salvation of our kids is part of the kingdom. The promise to be free from depression, from anxiety, to live a clean sanctified life. Is part of the promise of inheritance. It is our kingdom. Satan Satan Satan cannot be in our kingdom. The kingdom of God is peace, joy, victory, glory to God. As the Bible says 1 Corinthians 4:20, for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power. Amen. How many wants the power of God in our life? &gt;&gt; Lord, I want more of your power in my life. &gt;&gt; That's what I desire. Father, &gt;&gt; grant it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Musicians in Father Peter took a steal 10 minutes out of my time, but sweep over my soul. Sweep over my soul. Sweep over my soul. Sweet spirit. Sweep over my soul. My wrath is complete. My seat at your feet spirit sweep over my soul. Sweep over my soul. Sweep over my soul. Sweet spirit sweep over my soul. My rest is complete. I see that you sweet spirit sweep over my soul. Let's try chorus and rule over my soul. Rule over my soul. The prophet says not only savior but we want him to be savior and lord. We want him to rule upon our lives. Rule over my soul. My heart when I drink from your cup. Sweet spit rule over my soul. Any request that anyone would like to express publicly? I'm sure if I just praying asking for the younger brother and the older brother to be touched by the Lord. older brother was know the message but became a bit lukewarm just need God to touch him again just God has not given up on anybody might go a long way long way but once you already took that hook &gt;&gt; you will just come back no matter what amen I have a request for thanksgiving anything please express Sister Mike, &gt;&gt; I just want to thank the Lord for um helping me find my key, my car key.

Amen. &gt;&gt; I just just want to thank God for his love, mercy, and grace in my life, for my wife and children uh for watching over this past year of 2025. It's been a very challenging year, especially for my wife. She's had to go through some serious health issues and but through it all, God's been there. I've been trying to encourage her that, you know, that the doctors can do what they can do and you know, they can use the medicine, but it takes a great physician to come on the scene and to touch her body. And I believe God has already done that. Um, and she's doing well. Um, and for my children also, of course, everybody knows my situation all too well. and I'm seeing a change in our uh our Candace and uh I think God is working behind the scenes and uh you know and it's the little things that you know you pick up on. It's it's not the big things so much. it's, you know, you know, the makeup's gone, you know, and she's hasn't cut her hair for a long time. And I think that to me that's a sign that God's working on her &gt;&gt; and she's uh I see she's starting to wear, you know, the skirts again a little bit once in a while and she's got but you know it's all part of the process and it's all because you know sisters out there loving her you know inviting her out and people that are praying this it's so important &gt;&gt; correct &gt;&gt; that we as a body of Christ &gt;&gt; absolutely &gt;&gt; can love one another with no strings attached and just say God bless you. God bless you. We're praying for you. They know that. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; That's what's going to win them back. That's what wins anybody back is prayer, love. Correct. &gt;&gt; And I just pray that we could all pull together tonight in prayer for our loved ones, for our friends, for our maybe for it's for a worker or whatever it is. Somebody that out there that needs Christ, but doesn't know how to reach out. Somebody reached out to me 35 years ago. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; And they prayed for me.
