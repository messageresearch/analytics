[10:28] We're going to kind of have a
[10:30] kind of a mixed up uh beginning here,
[10:33] but that's that'll be all right.
[10:36] If I can ask
[10:39] brother Victor if he could come and open
[10:40] a word of prayer. There's a serious
[10:42] prayer request here. for brother David
[10:45] Huckal and he's been been admin
[10:48] administered to the hospital admitted to
[10:50] the hospital with severe abdomen issues
[10:53] and I think they found cancer in his
[10:55] abdomen and so he needs a touch from the
[10:59] Lord
[11:01] can we can take our burdens of the Lord
[11:02] and that's why we come to church because
[11:04] we're needy people
[11:14] This time it's not just going to be only
[11:16] me. I would appreciate if you all could
[11:19] join.
[11:21] If we don't rise up, saints, cancer will
[11:24] run through the camp. Amen.
[11:31] Most gracious loving father
[11:38] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ as
[11:40] a body we approach your throne of grace
[11:42] this morning.
[11:44] We thank you father the father for the
[11:46] perfect atonement.
[11:48] We thank you Lord for the precious name
[11:50] of our Lord Jesus Christ that you gave
[11:54] to your family to approach you. You've
[11:57] pre preserved us this morning. Lord,
[12:00] you've brought us into your house. We
[12:03] are under great expectation, Lord. That
[12:06] we will hear from heaven. Lord, we will
[12:09] hear from home. Dear God, we believe
[12:12] Lord you will use your servant this
[12:14] morning, Father, like an oracle, Father,
[12:17] and and speak to your children, Lord,
[12:19] the word of deliverance to whether it's
[12:22] rebuke, whatever it is, Father, we have
[12:24] come, Lord God, to to hear from you,
[12:27] Lord, and to to to wait before you,
[12:29] Father. But Lord, we've just heard,
[12:31] Lord, the just a few moments ago, one of
[12:35] our brethren is afflicted, Lord.
[12:38] You told us if two on earth shall agree
[12:41] touching anything it shall be done.
[12:46] Is there not a cross among us Lord
[12:48] Jesus?
[12:50] Brother Doug Lord has been sent to the
[12:52] hospice. He's been given just a few
[12:55] months to live. Father, what more would
[12:58] it take for your body to rise? Lord,
[13:04] father,
[13:06] sister charity is asking that the body
[13:09] would remember her husband.
[13:12] But Lord, it's not just a husband. It's
[13:14] our brother.
[13:18] And you said what we bind on earth shall
[13:20] be bound in heaven. If that is not the
[13:24] case, why are we following this truth,
[13:26] Lord?
[13:28] Therefore, we call on heaven to to
[13:30] confirm the word.
[13:33] We speak against that spirit in the name
[13:35] of Jesus.
[13:37] That brother Hakala could be let loose
[13:39] and be free.
[13:41] You evil spirit of cancer.
[13:45] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[13:47] the body of Christ binds you. We set him
[13:50] free. We set brother Doc free. Amen. And
[13:54] anyone among us where cancerous cells
[13:57] are beginning to form,
[13:59] we condemn the works of darkness this
[14:01] morning.
[14:03] Lord by the authority of the word of God
[14:06] given to them that believe. Lord, we
[14:09] wait for you to speak through your
[14:11] servant. Lord, anoint him like never
[14:13] before. Oh God, may the presence of God
[14:16] be felt among us. take full control and
[14:20] set at liberty them that are bound this
[14:23] morning. We thank you Lord. We bless
[14:26] your name in Jesus name. Amen.

[20:29] just want to say
[20:31] thank you, Lord,

[21:44] were bound,
[21:46] you set us free.
[21:49] We can't forget, Lord, all of the things
[21:54] that you have done.
[21:58] For Lord, we travel
[22:02] by land
[22:04] and we travel
[22:07] by air.
[22:09] We know you kept us, Lord. You kept us
[22:13] from hurt, harm, and danger.
[22:20] Oh, maybe
[22:22] tomorrow
[22:24] I have trles.
[22:27] I'll have sorrows
[22:29] and a thousand
[22:32] tears.
[22:35] They may fall, oh Lord Jesus.
[22:39] But until I face tomorrow's test, I'll
[22:45] have no
[22:47] special favors to ask, nor but I just
[22:52] want to say
[22:54] thank you, Lord.
[22:59] Oh, you've been so good
[23:04] and you've been so kind.
[23:09] Be careful and Lord all of the things

[24:26] Oh, I
[24:29] just want to say
[24:33] thank you, Lord.
[24:37] [Music]
[24:57] [Applause]
[25:02] You think about the the woman in the
[25:04] Bible. She said, "Uh, Lord, Even uh even
[25:06] dogs eat from the master's table. And
[25:08] that was that was that was our lot. We
[25:10] weren't part of the original seed. We
[25:12] weren't we're part of the plan, but we
[25:14] weren't born in. He he adopted us and he
[25:17] gave us his life. And now we get to sit
[25:19] with him on his throne. And yeah. Amen.
[25:22] Let's sing.
[25:26] I'm going through
[25:35] Start with the chorus.
[25:38] I'm going through.
[25:41] I'm going through.
[25:44] I'll pay the price. Whatever others do.
[25:51] I'll take the way with the Lord's
[25:55] despised view. I've started with Jesus
[26:00] and I'm going through.
[26:03] Lord, I have started to walk in the
[26:08] light that shines on my pathway so
[26:12] clear, so bright.
[26:16] I've paid the world and it's fall a do.
[26:22] And now with my savior,
[26:25] I'm to go through.
[26:28] I'm going through.
[26:31] I'm going through. I I'll pay the price.
[26:37] Whatever others do.
[26:40] I'll take the way with the Lord's
[26:44] despised view. I've started with Jesus
[26:49] and I'm going through
[26:53] men
[26:55] to run in this race. But with our
[27:00] redeemer
[27:01] that could not keep pace,
[27:05] others accepted because it was new. But
[27:11] not very many seem bound to go through.
[27:17] I'm going through.
[27:20] I'm going through.
[27:23] I'll pay the price whatever others do.
[27:29] I'll take the way with the Lord's
[27:32] despised view. I've started with Jesus
[27:37] and I'm going through.
[27:42] Praise the Lord. Is that how you feel
[27:44] this morning? I'm going through no
[27:46] matter who goes with me.
[27:49] Amen. We're running this race fervently.
[27:52] And we've got to make it. Can you say
[27:54] amen? Hallelujah. Amen. You may be
[27:56] seated for a moment. Amen.
[27:59] It'll take a few minutes now, but I've
[28:02] got an important announcement to make.
[28:05] Now, I think some of you already know or
[28:08] as suspected, but like the songwriter
[28:12] appropriately declares, is my God. Amen.
[28:16] The time is filled with swift
[28:19] transition. How many can say amen?
[28:22] So hold to God's unchanging hand. We've
[28:26] got to keep holding on to God's
[28:29] unchanging hand. Amen. Now the time has
[28:32] come for me. Amen. To make a transition
[28:35] in my life.
[28:37] Amen. I'm 81 years old.
[28:41] That will affect all of us to some
[28:44] degree.
[28:45] Everyone a little bit different.
[28:49] But we have to trust the Lord that he
[28:53] will guide us. We have a guide. We've
[28:56] got a Holy Spirit that will guide us
[28:59] safely through time of great changes in
[29:02] the world. You You can read the papers
[29:04] or listen to the news. There's changes
[29:07] coming.
[29:08] Changes in the world and in the church
[29:10] world. We've got to be awake and very
[29:13] open-minded. Can you say amen? Say,
[29:15] "Lord, reveal unto me what your will
[29:18] is." Amen. We are following Jesus one
[29:22] step at a time. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[29:26] Therefore, the time has come for me to
[29:28] pass on the torch. There's young
[29:31] brothers out there, much more energetic
[29:34] than I. I thought I was energetic at one
[29:36] time, and I was. I thought I would I
[29:39] would not quit anytime. I would go on
[29:42] forever and ever and ever because I felt
[29:44] like a 50y old guy. Anybody believe that
[29:46] an old man like me
[29:48] But it's time to pass the torch to a new
[29:50] generation that the Lord has raised up.
[29:53] Not man, but the Lord has raised up
[29:56] young men to lead the church. Now, it's
[29:59] not the men that will lead the church.
[30:00] It's the Holy Spirit through these men.
[30:03] And we need Holy Ghost men to lead the
[30:05] church. Can you say amen? So that these
[30:08] cancers will be cast out because the
[30:11] gospel is demonstrated.
[30:13] In other words, not just talking, not
[30:15] just speaking, but demonstrated by the
[30:18] power of the living God. Hallelujah.
[30:20] That's what I believed and that's I
[30:21] still believe it to lead the church to
[30:24] higher grounds. I believe there's higher
[30:27] grounds for us and deeper depths in the
[30:31] word.
[30:33] The Lord has taken us already very deep,
[30:35] but we need to get deeper into the word
[30:38] into the demonstrating part. That's
[30:40] where we somewhat fail is the
[30:42] demonstrating part. Amen.
[30:44] So over the last few months,
[30:48] I have been blessed with or we have been
[30:50] blessed with many great ministries
[30:52] coming through here. How many know that?
[30:54] I've invited these brothers. Amen. And
[30:57] we will continue to invite them as the
[31:00] Lord leads. Can you say amen? It's just
[31:03] not one ministry. It's many a many
[31:06] membered body. It's a fivefold ministry.
[31:10] Each one having a different ministry.
[31:12] And the Lord will lead us because we
[31:15] have enjoyed the rich word of the Lord.
[31:17] Amen. Provided for this day, not
[31:20] yesterday, but for this day. That's what
[31:22] we're expecting the word of God for this
[31:24] day to be preached. Amen. So, you can
[31:27] expect great times in the presence of
[31:30] the Lord.
[31:32] Not less, but more. Amen.
[31:35] As we are facing in the great gifts sent
[31:39] to the body of Jesus Christ.
[31:42] I believe there's gifts sent to the body
[31:45] of Jesus Christ. Amen. Hallelujah. And
[31:48] brother Moses is one of them.
[31:50] Hallelujah. Can you say amen? Amen.
[31:53] Amen. So we are grateful to the Lord
[31:56] that he has sent us brother Moses filled
[31:59] with Holy Ghost believing the same
[32:01] message we believe the same power that
[32:05] we believe in that every anything is
[32:07] possible to the Lord. My what a blessing
[32:10] God has sent us. And we can all say amen
[32:14] again. Amen. And amen. Amen. Now, I have
[32:18] been your pastor
[32:21] in this church. Now, we have a great
[32:23] chief pastor, which is the Lord,
[32:26] but I have been your your earthly pastor
[32:28] in this church since 2002.
[32:32] Amen.
[32:33] 23 years of service in this church.
[32:38] And I can say the Lord has been
[32:41] faithful. Yes. Faithful. Faithful. And
[32:45] blessed us. Right. Sister Marie blessed
[32:48] us so richly over the years alongside my
[32:52] son Steve. How many remember brother
[32:54] Steven? For 20 years. Brother Steven was
[32:57] with us and we enjoyed his ministry.
[33:00] Amen. And I can testify that we had some
[33:03] wonderful times in the Lord when the
[33:05] presence of the Lord was so near.
[33:09] So powerful. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[33:14] And we have shared the burdens and the
[33:19] joys,
[33:21] one another's burdens. When you were
[33:23] sick, we felt sick. We prayed for.
[33:26] Hallelujah. Praise God. What a great
[33:29] privilege the Lord has given me to serve
[33:32] the bride of Christ for 23 some years.
[33:37] Isn't that amazing grace?
[33:39] My and brother.
[33:43] [Applause]
[33:46] My my my my what a blessing that is. You
[33:50] know, words cannot describe how blessed
[33:52] I am.
[33:55] I said, Lord, I want to just serve you.
[33:57] I just want to be used. I didn't want to
[33:58] be the pastor. Lord, I just want to be
[34:01] used of you somehow so that when I stand
[34:03] before you that you could say, "Well
[34:05] done, my
[34:07] I didn't want a great position. It never
[34:09] was my desire. And brother Victor
[34:12] expressed it in the office or in the
[34:14] Sunday school as well. That's what he
[34:16] wants. He wants to be a servant of the
[34:18] Lord. Hallelujah. Is that what you said,
[34:20] brother? I think that Amen. So I want to
[34:23] read can I read you I'm not going to
[34:24] preach this morning but can I just read
[34:26] you a quotation that describes the bride
[34:28] of Christ that describes you
[34:32] that that you are the ones that I was to
[34:36] serve. Hallelujah. I'm a little bit
[34:37] emotional. You can understand that. I've
[34:40] always emotional. Amen. It says the
[34:43] invisible union of the bride. You are
[34:46] the virtuous bride of Christ. Amen.
[34:50] Not just because of your flesh, not
[34:52] because of your goodness, it's because
[34:55] of his grace. Amen. And the blood of
[34:58] Jesus that washed us clean like we heard
[35:01] on Wednesday. Amen. We've got to be
[35:04] washed clean by the blood of Jesus. And
[35:07] then we can claim all these wonderful
[35:09] promises of God. Amen. Washed in the
[35:12] blood of of Christ. Precious.
[35:16] You're precious.
[35:18] Virtuous
[35:20] my virtuous that means you have power
[35:23] dunamis power inside of you. Amen. When
[35:26] you pray something happens. Hallelujah.
[35:30] Virtuous. Sinless. Can you imagine
[35:32] sinless son of God standing with a pure
[35:36] unadulterated bride word that he washed
[35:39] by the water of his own blood and his
[35:42] own word that become flesh and
[35:45] manifested that he might take you
[35:48] which were predestinated in the bosom of
[35:51] the father before the beginning the same
[35:54] as he was. Hallelujah. We we are not
[35:57] from our earthly father and mother like
[35:59] we heard on Wednesday. That's not my
[36:02] heritage. My father is God and I am a
[36:05] son of God and offspring of the living
[36:08] God. Hallelujah. Amen. Now like I said I
[36:12] never dreamed to be pastor but the Lord
[36:14] opened up the way
[36:16] and that is how the Lord is opening up
[36:18] the way right now in brother Moses's
[36:21] life. Amen. I believe so. Now, I believe
[36:25] that like I said, it's not only brother
[36:27] Moses ministry, but other ministries.
[36:29] Amen. In the body of Christ, and the
[36:31] Lord will use us. Praise God. Amen.
[36:35] Hallelujah. So, I never dreamed to be
[36:38] the pastor, but the Lord made a way.
[36:40] Amen. And I truly believe we will all be
[36:44] together one day in that great
[36:46] resurrection, a great resurrection
[36:48] morning when the dead in Christ shall
[36:50] rise
[36:52] and it will be in order of the
[36:54] resurrection. I don't have a quote with
[36:56] me, but brother Brandham says we'll be
[36:57] with our loved ones, the ones that we
[36:59] know. It'll be the order of the
[37:03] resurrection. In other words, a
[37:04] battalion, a fighting force that are
[37:08] moving upward into the skies.
[37:09] Hallelujah. To meet our loved ones.
[37:12] We'll be together. Amen. The pastor will
[37:14] be with his sheep. Amen. We'll all be
[37:17] together, one flock, and we'll be
[37:19] together with the Lord forever. Now,
[37:22] I've been praying for the past year.
[37:24] I've been praying, Lord, have your way.
[37:29] Right, Sister Sophia? Have your way,
[37:32] Lord, with this little church.
[37:35] as I'm getting on in years and weaker as
[37:38] a result. You know, I appreciate brother
[37:40] Victor's words on Wednesday. He says,
[37:42] you know, I brought brother Z 80 years
[37:45] old, but he's like like Caleb and Joshua
[37:49] 80 years old and moving on. Listen, I I
[37:52] regained my energy, but you know, I want
[37:54] to pass on the torch so that you get the
[37:57] benefits. Amen.
[37:59] As you know, the Lord has answered our
[38:01] prayers many times before
[38:04] when we needed a piano player. I We got
[38:07] to recall all these things. The mercies
[38:09] of God has been ours. We've been so
[38:12] privileged. Amen. We The Lord answered
[38:15] our prayer and he sent he sent us a
[38:18] piano player that has been faithful on
[38:20] the job every service. Amen, brother
[38:22] Peter. Hallelujah. It was the Lord,
[38:25] Brother Peter. I believe so. We're
[38:28] following the Lord Jesus one step at a
[38:30] time. We prayed and the Lord answered
[38:33] our prayer and he sent us Brother Peter.
[38:35] What a blessing he's been. And what a
[38:38] blessing we have had with brother Andrew
[38:41] leading us in songs. And Sister Kathy,
[38:46] Amen. singing specials on many
[38:48] occasions, blessing our souls. Amen.
[38:51] Deep from her heart. Amen.
[38:55] I want you to know I love every one of
[38:58] you with all of my heart.
[39:01] I don't want to get too emotional right
[39:03] now because I know it's not saying
[39:06] goodbye. We're going to be with you
[39:07] here. I'm going to repeat this. I'm
[39:09] going to be with you here. Maybe I'm not
[39:12] in the same position. I mean, we'll be
[39:14] facing it in. You understand? We'll be
[39:16] facing it in. We'll help brother Moses.
[39:19] Amen. To get himself comfortable in the
[39:22] position to your needs to visit you.
[39:25] Amen. To counsel you, whatever it will
[39:28] be.
[39:30] But I have come to realize that time
[39:32] stops for nobody. Not even for me. I
[39:34] thought it would stop for me. Amen.
[39:37] Because Lord, I said I'm getting on in
[39:40] age on it has to happen one of these
[39:43] days. One of these years,
[39:45] right? I mean, I can keep on one more
[39:47] year.
[39:49] Moses said to me first, you know, maybe
[39:51] a couple of years. I says, what? A
[39:54] couple of years,
[39:56] a couple of years. I don't have so many.
[39:59] Amen. Well, while my son says, I have
[40:02] more 20 more years. Hallelujah. Now, I
[40:06] have to come to realize time stops for
[40:08] nobody until we get that immortal body
[40:11] that we're all waiting for. Then we'll
[40:14] we can make our boat in the sun and
[40:16] still exist. Hallelujah. Therefore, I
[40:19] felt in my heart to seek the Lord for a
[40:22] faithful,
[40:24] humble man. God still use this man. It's
[40:28] not just push play. Is God using men
[40:32] that are filled with the Holy Spirit.
[40:35] Amen. Amen. I was looking for a
[40:37] faithful, humble man. And brother Moses
[40:39] is a humble man. I've discovered that.
[40:43] Amen. To be our new pastor.
[40:47] who would have a burden and love for the
[40:50] people. That's important. It's more
[40:54] important maybe than maybe being able to
[40:56] speak eloquently. Can you say amen? It's
[40:59] not eloquent speech is what we're
[41:01] looking for. We're looking for the power
[41:02] of God. We're looking for the Holy
[41:04] Spirit in some brother's life.
[41:07] And you know, I was looking for a man
[41:09] that had a burden for missions
[41:12] because our burden is for missions. He
[41:14] said, "I have wanting to be not a
[41:16] pastor. I wanted to do mission work,
[41:18] brother." I said, "You can do mission
[41:20] work right here through this church. We
[41:23] have done more work than many big
[41:25] churches." And I can prove it to you in
[41:27] a moment here. But the prophet said,
[41:30] prophet of God said, "We can never go
[41:32] wrong doing missionary work." Never.
[41:35] Never. Now, not to boast, but our little
[41:39] church here goes here. Our our little
[41:41] church has printed more books in India
[41:45] than all the big churches combined.
[41:48] I tell you we have we spent thousands of
[41:53] dollars. We have printed over a million
[41:56] now last year was a million. It we have
[41:58] printed over a million message books
[42:00] today. Isn't that a good achievement?
[42:03] And it was amen declared throughout
[42:07] different regions in India. Many souls
[42:10] were saved and baptized with the Holy
[42:13] Ghost uh through these messages. Praise
[42:15] God. Amen. Amen. Our Lord did say gave
[42:19] us the last commission. He said, "Preach
[42:21] the word and demonstrate the gospel with
[42:24] signs falling." Amen. Mark 16. Amen.
[42:28] That's what we Christians do. That is
[42:30] the the evidence of the Holy Spirit that
[42:33] we do what Christians do. I read the
[42:36] quote on on last Sunday. Amen. That's
[42:38] what Christians do. Birds fly. Amen.
[42:42] Fish, they swim. And the Christians do
[42:45] godly things. Can you say amen? That's
[42:46] what the prophet said. For it is our
[42:49] duty.
[42:50] Let me say it. It's not the pastor's
[42:52] duty or the preacher's duty. It's our
[42:55] duty, all of our duty to find that last
[42:57] seat. That's why we are all
[42:59] missionaries. We're all out there to to
[43:02] testify that God has sent a message in
[43:05] our day.
[43:08] And it's still necessary to tell them
[43:10] God sent a prophet. Amen. We've had a
[43:13] signpost. That's why we're moving that
[43:15] direction. Hallelujah. Therefore, by
[43:17] faith, I have reached out to different
[43:19] brothers over lunch because when you eat
[43:23] lunch, everything softens up a little
[43:25] bit. Amen. Amen. Asking them if they
[43:28] would consider becoming a pastor one
[43:30] day. I was just feeling it out. And then
[43:33] I said, "Well, maybe maybe this church."
[43:35] Amen. and and you know but each one of
[43:38] them said one said I'm not called for
[43:40] the job because I feel like my job is
[43:43] being an apostle opening up churches and
[43:47] you know who I'm talking about opening
[43:49] up churches and bridge medicine that was
[43:52] his ministry and we don't want to rob
[43:55] him from that ministry hallelujah praise
[43:57] God so hallelujah so praise God so I'm
[44:02] I'm going right right into into shorten
[44:04] it a little bit But finally, I
[44:08] approached brother Moses,
[44:11] and I'm going to go into detail, a
[44:12] little bit more detail than necessary,
[44:14] but detail is sometimes necessary. Amen.
[44:17] I've approached brother Moh Moses, who
[44:20] initially gave me a very similar answer
[44:22] as all the other brothers,
[44:24] but he left the door open. Brother
[44:26] Moses, I you remember, I think it was,
[44:29] right?
[44:30] Amen.
[44:32] We were joined in chicken. He left I I
[44:35] think it was I'm not sure. Amen.
[44:39] Amen. He left the door open for
[44:42] consideration. And he said, you know
[44:44] what he said? And that's the right
[44:45] answer. He said, I'll pray about it.
[44:50] Isn't that a good answer? He didn't say
[44:52] no, no, no, it's not for me. No, he said
[44:55] I'll pray about it. And I believe that
[44:57] he's prayed about it. And thank God that
[45:00] gave me hope. Amen. Because I know God
[45:04] answers prayer. He's answered many of my
[45:06] prayer.
[45:08] I believe the Lord has answered all our
[45:11] prayers. And over the years, you know,
[45:13] when I was getting down, when I
[45:15] collapsed here in the church, you always
[45:17] say what's going to happen, right? I
[45:19] mean, different ones, right? But the
[45:21] Lord answers our prayers and our needs.
[45:24] Amen. It was not until some weeks later
[45:29] I had to wait for Moses and we wait for
[45:31] God. And you know, I just put it out
[45:34] there and he was praying probably
[45:36] earnestly and I said Lord but I had
[45:38] already given up.
[45:41] Amen. But you know brother Moses let me
[45:43] know by phone call and he said I'm still
[45:46] praying brother. Amen.
[45:49] Are you still praying? Yes. He says and
[45:52] he said something is beginning to happen
[45:55] in my soul. Maybe not those exact words
[45:58] but he says it's beginning to burn
[46:00] inside of me. My Wasn't that how it was
[46:04] when the disciples walked to the mids?
[46:08] Their souls were burning inside of them.
[46:11] And you know, it was still not it didn't
[46:13] clench it at that moment. But a short
[46:16] time later, I received another phone
[46:18] call from brother Moses. Amen. Maybe I
[46:21] should have followed up, but Moses Moses
[46:23] is a better communicator than maybe he's
[46:26] younger. That's why. I I need some
[46:29] excuse. And immediately I addressed the
[46:31] situ right away. I said, "Brother Moses,
[46:33] does it still burn? Does it still burn
[46:35] in your soul?" Because I wanted an
[46:37] answer. Amen.
[46:39] And to my surprise, and I shouldn't have
[46:41] been surprised. I He said, "My heart is
[46:44] burning now more than ever."
[46:47] Am I correct on it, brother Moses? Yeah.
[46:50] Okay. So, I'm going now and then one
[46:55] Sunday, I'm skipping a little bit here.
[46:57] And one Sunday morning service,
[47:00] I called brother Moses into the Sunday
[47:02] school room, ask him if it was still
[47:05] burning in his heart. And there he said
[47:08] something very significant that made a
[47:10] lot of difference in my my judgment. He
[47:13] says now it's not only
[47:17] but it was turning into an unexplainable
[47:20] burden. Now a burden you can't explain
[47:22] it. Why is it now becoming a burden on
[47:25] my soul?
[47:27] Amen. Indicating he was willing to
[47:29] accept what the Lord had for him here at
[47:33] the church. It's not what I had. It's
[47:36] not what I designed
[47:39] because, you know, years ago, I sort of
[47:41] had my son in mind, you know, we all
[47:44] cling to our children, right? And we can
[47:47] trust our children. But this was the
[47:48] Lord moving on the brother. Amen. Amen.
[47:53] But he made one thing clear to me.
[47:57] want to know what it was.
[47:59] He doesn't want to push himself onto
[48:03] you know what that means. He doesn't
[48:05] want to force himself.
[48:07] But that's a humble man. That's not an
[48:10] ambitious man. Amen. I don't want to
[48:13] push myself into the position. But he
[48:16] was willing to accept it if
[48:20] the people would embrace him and love
[48:23] him. Amen. Can we say amen to that? And
[48:28] can we give a brother Moses an applause
[48:30] for this? Hallelujah. And receive him. I
[48:34] don't know what you think, but I believe
[48:36] it was the Lord working on both ends. We
[48:38] had a need. The Lord supplied it.
[48:41] Hallelujah. What a joy that is. Amen.
[48:43] The Lord
[48:46] The Lord is so mindful of a little bitty
[48:50] group of people. And we are bit a little
[48:53] bitty on Wednesday really on Wednesdays.
[48:56] Sometimes 9, sometimes 10. But the Lord
[49:00] is mindful of this little group in
[49:02] restored
[49:03] restored workship.
[49:06] He cares for the sparrow.
[49:09] He cares for me. Hallelujah. Amen. He
[49:11] cares for you. Now,
[49:15] I'm I'm sure you understand and you
[49:17] should know that it was not easy for me
[49:20] to transition after so long a time has
[49:24] passed. It's not easy.
[49:27] I thought that I wanted to just keep on
[49:30] being a dictator. I don't think I was a
[49:33] dictator but you know I you know wanted
[49:35] to be something I wanted the Lord to
[49:38] have his way. Amen. And because I
[49:42] was very hard to make that that decision
[49:46] because we have grown together. Right.
[49:48] Brother Daniel, brother Daniel, well,
[49:52] you not so long, but well, we I know
[49:54] from time for a long time, but you know,
[49:56] brother Dan, we grown together, right?
[49:57] Grown together and loved one another,
[50:00] visited with one another. Hallelujah.
[50:04] But I thought I would go on forever,
[50:07] but the Lord has
[50:10] he speaks. How could he get me out of
[50:11] the job if he wouldn't have knocked me
[50:13] down?
[50:16] Sometimes the Lord has to take some
[50:17] action, right? He has to take something
[50:19] away from you so that you realize who
[50:21] you are. You know how what we are. Take
[50:24] a bucket of water, brother says, and
[50:27] stick your finger,
[50:29] pull it out. Then you know what we are.
[50:31] You know, it's only by his grace that
[50:34] we're saved. Hallelujah. His grace is
[50:37] all sufficient to me and all of us. So
[50:40] we can say, "Thank you, Lord." Can you
[50:43] say, "Thank you, Lord." Thank you, Lord.
[50:44] Amen. thing I can say with confidence
[50:47] now this this morning and with joy in my
[50:49] heart I have not shunn to declare to you
[50:53] the whole message of the hour
[50:58] I declared all of it to you I laid it
[51:02] out to you I laid out 70 weeks of Daniel
[51:04] I laid out the godhead I laid out
[51:07] predestination I've laid it all over 23
[51:09] years brother Victor you can imagine how
[51:12] much I
[51:14] preached holiness
[51:15] that we need to be holy unto the Lord.
[51:18] Amen.
[51:19] And I've not compromised on the word of
[51:22] God for anything.
[51:25] For nobody, for nobody. I may have not
[51:28] been popular, but you know something? I
[51:31] did not compromise the word for
[51:32] anything. And I I am amen determined in
[51:37] my life not to compromise now.
[51:39] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. I have
[51:42] gladly borne the reproach of the
[51:44] Pentecostal blessing which I fully
[51:47] embrace. I'm not talking about the
[51:49] denomination now. I'm talking about the
[51:52] Pentecostal blessing of yester year
[51:55] 2,000 years ago. We need it. Hallelujah.
[52:00] Now it's up to us to run this race. You
[52:05] got to run with ferveny. Leo is all
[52:08] around us. We got to run with ferveny.
[52:10] Sorry, brother Moses. I'm taking so much
[52:11] time. I I'll close you here in a moment.
[52:14] But we have read the signpost. We've
[52:16] read the prophet's message. That's the
[52:18] signpost. Let's move on to our
[52:21] destination.
[52:23] Hallelujah. Let's move on. Amen. To
[52:26] perfection with our heavenly husband in
[52:29] divine love, obeying every word of God.
[52:33] Check it out where you are. Are you
[52:35] obeying the word of God? Amen. as the
[52:38] prophet would scream out, "Stay in
[52:40] line." Amen. I want to stay in line and
[52:43] I trust you will also. Amen. Now, I'm
[52:46] not resigning from my ministry.
[52:49] I'm just transitioning
[52:52] into another phase of
[52:55] understand what I'm saying.
[52:57] There is need to visit people also make
[53:01] visitation in hospitals.
[53:04] Amen. Everyone is needed in the body of
[53:07] Christ. We need all need encouragement
[53:10] to move on with God. Hallelujah.
[53:13] And Anita and I will be here in this
[53:16] church.
[53:17] Hallelujah.
[53:19] Assisting brother Moses.
[53:21] We'll be sitting right there. Amen.
[53:24] Every service, not just oh maybe one
[53:26] service here, one service there. This is
[53:28] where we feel. We need to be here in our
[53:31] post of duty.
[53:33] Amen. I will Anita and I will be here in
[53:36] this church assisting brother Moses in
[53:38] any way that we can especially now in
[53:41] the transition time. You know he'll take
[53:44] on different duties and he'll uh we'll
[53:46] have different ministers coming in
[53:48] helping him and helping me. So we will
[53:50] be working together with brother Victor.
[53:53] We're all in the ministry together.
[53:55] Let's work together. Let's not say well
[53:57] I want to hear my favorite preacher.
[53:59] Don't do that. That hurts all of us. Can
[54:02] you say amen? You've got to be here in
[54:04] your position. Amen. And I support that
[54:07] you'll support this ministry with all of
[54:10] your body, soul, and spirit.
[54:12] Amen. And now I would ask brother Moses
[54:15] to come and stand here. Could you sorry
[54:18] I should have warned you?
[54:20] I warned you on the phone.
[54:23] Amen. You know what we're going to do is
[54:25] we're going to take a confidence. I I I
[54:28] have so much confidence in this humble
[54:30] man of God. Amen. And I hope that you
[54:34] will be stand with me on this and
[54:38] support him in this ministry that he is
[54:40] now giving. He needs your love. He needs
[54:43] your support. And like he said, he then
[54:45] he's willing to serve. Now, if you don't
[54:47] show the support, how can he serve us?
[54:50] Amen. So I I'm going to ask brother
[54:52] brother.
[54:56] Okay. How many are in favor
[54:59] of giving brotherh Moses the confidence
[55:02] vote of confidence? Now we have one
[55:04] every two years we have a vote of
[55:06] confidence to the for the deacons and
[55:08] trustees. So that is done regularly but
[55:11] this is the initiation of brother Moses
[55:13] into service here and we'll another time
[55:16] we'll have maybe ministry maybe an
[55:18] apostle be here praying for him and
[55:20] anointing him and blessing him in the
[55:22] service. We'll have maybe brother

[55:26] and all together
[55:29] praying for him big brother Victor
[55:30] everybody praying for him standing with
[55:33] him amen so how many would agree that
[55:36] that that brother Moses is a good choice
[55:40] you know something I think everybody's
[55:42] raising their hand
[55:44] I would like you to see but I better not
[55:46] show you anybody against anybody against
[55:49] put anybody against nobody's against so
[55:53] praise the Lord amen
[55:56] Hallelujah. Let's welcome brother Moses

[56:08] you the congregation now to keep working
[56:11] with the ministry
[56:14] that includes brother Moses our pastor.
[56:18] I'll call him my pastor now.

[56:23] in this church. Can I say that?
[56:26] Amen. Now, he's traveling to Africa
[56:28] different times, but but brother Victor
[56:30] is one of our ministers that we have
[56:32] blessed by, you know, I've really been
[56:34] blessed by his ministry of teaching and
[56:36] going deeper into the word of God. Amen.
[56:39] What is necessary?
[56:41] We got to point it out. Amen.
[56:43] Amen. That includes brother Moses,
[56:46] brother Victor, and myself and the many
[56:49] visiting ministries we are planning to
[56:52] have. We're not shutting down. That's
[56:54] why we need your offerings and your
[56:56] tithes. You see, nothing is without
[56:58] expenses. Can you say amen? And I thank
[57:01] each one of you for the support that you
[57:03] have given. But I would like you to come
[57:06] support us with your attendance. That's
[57:09] where we are weak. We say, "Oh, I've got
[57:11] work to do." Listen, there's nothing
[57:13] more important than the work of the
[57:15] Lord. Amen. Support with your
[57:18] attendance, your tithes and offerings,
[57:20] and most of all, your prayers. Amen. So
[57:23] brothers and sisters, I'm not saying
[57:24] goodbye. Amen.
[57:27] But we want to be in his presence and we
[57:31] want the Lord to bind us together until
[57:33] he returns because we all want to be
[57:36] there. Can you say amen? Hallelujah.
[57:38] Praise the Lord.
[57:41] I hope I did okay, brother.
[57:45] Amen. Because I was very nervous. I was
[57:48] I was very nervous. Amen.
[57:52] So let's sing that song. Can we put that
[57:54] one? Bind us together, Lord. Bind us
[57:57] together in Christian mouth. You can go
[57:59] on
[58:01] bind us.
[58:03] [Music]
[58:17] B us together, Lord. B us together,
[58:24] Lord. B us together.
[58:31] Amen. We already did it, but let's turn
[58:34] around and love one another and embrace
[58:37] one another. Say, "God bless you." Let's
[58:39] all work together. Brother Moses, you
[58:41] can come.
[58:43] [Music]
[58:46] And brother Moses, now you can come and
[58:49] take your time, brother Moses, to preach
[58:50] the word. Don't I took too much. We
[58:53] typed it in 10 minutes, but I took half
[58:55] hours. So I'm sorry. Come, brother
[58:56] Moses. And also,
[59:00] Brother Moses, could you at this time
[59:01] also close the service as well? Like
[59:04] after preaching, you
[59:06] close the service. We're a small group
[59:08] of people. We can
[59:11] Just feel comfortable. Praise God.
[59:28] Praise the Lord. Can you say amen?
[59:30] Hallelujah. Amen. We can rejoice. Amen.
[59:33] In the Lord. Amen.
[59:50] [Music]
[59:55] I hope it's fine.
[1:00:00] What can I say?
[1:00:03] What can I say? Um,
[1:00:06] thank you pastor. Thank you pastor. God
[1:00:09] bless you richly. We love you. Love you
[1:00:11] a lot. And
[1:00:13] I just feel um so humbled and so little
[1:00:18] and pastor said is emotional but um I'm
[1:00:23] even more emotional.
[1:00:29] even more emotional and I um I easily
[1:00:33] cry unfortunately but
[1:00:36] and that my nature but I hope it's fine
[1:00:40] man
[1:00:41] and
[1:00:43] I had a little bit of a small speech
[1:00:45] that I wanted to speak as well but um
[1:00:48] you know what I forgot that speech
[1:00:53] so I just want to say it from the bottom
[1:00:55] of my heart maybe just few words and Um,
[1:00:59] you know, I I'm just a man. I'm just a
[1:01:03] man. And brother Bam will repeat it many
[1:01:05] times, a pastor is just a man, right?
[1:01:07] Oh, yeah. So, we are just human beings.
[1:01:10] Um,
[1:01:12] when pastor told me as he said it, I I I
[1:01:16] could never I never represented my head
[1:01:18] that or be a pastor or never thought
[1:01:21] about because I lived with with pastors
[1:01:24] and the house where pastor was visiting.
[1:01:28] I know a lot of burdens they go through
[1:01:30] or the struggles they go through and
[1:01:34] I didn't want that.
[1:01:36] My nature is not sometimes a pastor has
[1:01:38] to be harsh and has to cut he has to be
[1:01:41] you know those that's not part of my I
[1:01:44] thought it was not part of my nature you
[1:01:46] know I don't want to hurt people too
[1:01:49] much and be personal and so I know I
[1:01:53] don't know pastor oh
[1:01:57] but um
[1:02:00] but as as I was praying as pastor said
[1:02:02] this so well and I was praying and
[1:02:04] shared that with pastor Ed as Well, been
[1:02:07] praying about it and so Lord and and
[1:02:10] then
[1:02:12] one of the message that really changed
[1:02:15] the way I look at it is taking side with
[1:02:18] Jesus. If you listen to it and then and
[1:02:22] brother Balam says
[1:02:24] I'm paraphrasing but a burden of a
[1:02:27] church it's also your burden. Amen. So
[1:02:30] it's not because I'm was in need I'm in
[1:02:32] the church there and and another church
[1:02:36] needs help. I can just know it's their
[1:02:39] problem. So it came upon me and I
[1:02:43] couldn't just let it and I know I I
[1:02:45] can't live without
[1:02:48] without Lord if it's your will let me
[1:02:51] let me be a servant. Amen. So um
[1:02:56] that's all.
[1:03:01] [Applause]
[1:03:05] I just want to be a servant. So
[1:03:08] um I ask pastor to so that you know me
[1:03:12] so that I know you and um so we'll um
[1:03:18] we'll work together. Amen. We have one
[1:03:21] purpose is the rapture.
[1:03:23] um the raptures, we have families, we
[1:03:26] have children, we have we we want all of
[1:03:29] them to be saved
[1:03:31] and to make it for the rapture. So,
[1:03:33] let's work together. We have our
[1:03:35] mistakes. We have our ups and downs, but
[1:03:38] let's help each other and then move on.
[1:03:41] Amen. If there is anything you want me
[1:03:43] to change or to correct, I will be
[1:03:45] willing to accept your your advice. Um
[1:03:50] but I will never never
[1:03:52] put down the advice of pastor never and
[1:03:56] um never whatever you tell me I will
[1:04:00] always take that with my heart
[1:04:03] because it's not it's not it's not an
[1:04:05] easy thing to leave your church to
[1:04:08] someone else and um so I will always
[1:04:12] take the advice of pastor no matter what
[1:04:14] thank you and um and he said this so
[1:04:18] well he's not stepping down he's always
[1:04:21] going to be there. I'm going to talk
[1:04:23] this morning about we are in a war.
[1:04:26] Yeah. And I thought about it. You know
[1:04:27] what? When you're in the army,
[1:04:31] if a general,
[1:04:33] he has a position of a general, says,
[1:04:35] "No, I'm retiring."
[1:04:38] When once he's retiring, he doesn't
[1:04:40] become a a lower class than the general.
[1:04:44] He stays a general.
[1:04:46] He remains a general no matter what.
[1:04:49] That's right. And will continue to be a
[1:04:50] general. So our pastor will stay pastor
[1:04:53] and I will always call him pastor no
[1:04:56] matter what in this army.
[1:04:59] So um but um
[1:05:03] let's just work together. Amen. God
[1:05:06] bless you richly. Amen. Thank you
[1:05:08] brother Peter and thank you for the
[1:05:09] trust and the confidence and um I love
[1:05:13] you and
[1:05:15] and we just work together. Amen.
[1:05:19] Can you have a word of prayer maybe and
[1:05:21] then read the word of God? Father, we
[1:05:23] thank you Lord this morning for
[1:05:28] for the for the worship. Hallelujah.
[1:05:31] Father for the song and for the special
[1:05:34] that was sung. How we express our
[1:05:37] thanksgiving towards you Lord. We want

[1:05:43] and the worship father all that you has

[1:05:48] that was made father we we believe we
[1:05:51] are walking here believing father and
[1:05:54] uniting our faith for our brother Lord
[1:05:56] and if one maybe might feel the symptoms
[1:06:00] but Lord we are standing behind him and
[1:06:02] holding him in prayer in the name of the
[1:06:05] lord Jesus Christ.

[1:06:10] Lord, and
[1:06:12] as you say this so well, Father, we we

[1:06:19] been announced publicly to the church,
[1:06:21] Father. Lord, we just want to bless our
[1:06:24] pastor, Lord, and bless him richly and

[1:06:30] him more years with us, Lord. And if the
[1:06:32] Lord carries and Lord, we love the
[1:06:34] spirit. We love the work. We love Lord
[1:06:38] just the way you you use him to to be a
[1:06:42] blessing for the bride. Not only this
[1:06:44] church, but all over the world, Father,
[1:06:47] for the work of God, Father, as a
[1:06:50] church, we just want to humble oursel
[1:06:51] before you and ask, Father, for your
[1:06:54] help, for your leadership, for your
[1:06:55] guidance. Lord, it may be an emotional
[1:06:58] moment now. Father, we Lord, we realize
[1:07:01] that we are nothing without you, Lord.
[1:07:03] Amen. May your grace be upon us, Father.
[1:07:06] May you give us wisdom. May you give us
[1:07:09] leadership. May you help us, Father,
[1:07:11] Lord, to always be obedient to your word
[1:07:15] as as the pastor said this so well. He
[1:07:17] has never never shun to declare the
[1:07:20] whole word of God, the whole council of
[1:07:22] God. Father, we desire to be a solid
[1:07:25] church as father has he has led us so
[1:07:29] far. You have led us through him, Lord,
[1:07:31] to come to a point of a solid
[1:07:33] wellestablished church. Father, don't
[1:07:36] let anything, Father, hinder the move of
[1:07:38] God, Lord, for this church.
[1:07:40] Father, we want you to have the
[1:07:42] preeminence and want you, Lord, to be
[1:07:45] the chief shepherd, Father, Lord, and
[1:07:47] and guide us and have Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:07:50] the power of the Holy Ghost still moving
[1:07:52] among us with liberty, Lord. And we want
[1:07:55] you, Father, Lord, to reign and rule. Be
[1:07:57] the Lord among us, Father. Lord, we
[1:07:59] commit ourselves to you, Lord. We need
[1:08:01] you, Lord. Thank you father for your
[1:08:04] promise that you said you shall never
[1:08:05] leave us shall never forsake us but
[1:08:08] you'll be always with us father Lord if
[1:08:11] you can take care of the little sparrows
[1:08:13] you will take care of us father the
[1:08:14] bride of Jesus Christ born father of the
[1:08:17] holy spirit father those who purchase of
[1:08:19] your own blood father you died for the
[1:08:22] people you died for us father lord we
[1:08:25] are the price of Jesus the blood of
[1:08:27] Jesus Christ how precious we are in your
[1:08:30] eyes father lord lord We just want to
[1:08:33] rely on your grace, your mercy, Father.
[1:08:35] Bless your people, Lord, as we surrender
[1:08:37] oursel to you, Lord. And I prepare
[1:08:39] something, Father, to share with your
[1:08:41] people this morning, Lord. May you
[1:08:43] anoint the word. May the Holy Spirit
[1:08:44] come, Father, and speak to our heart,
[1:08:47] Father, listen moment, Father, in Jesus
[1:08:49] Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen.

[1:08:56] And thank you, brother Victor, as well
[1:08:59] for support. Amen. God bless you richly.
[1:09:02] And I need you. We need one another. And
[1:09:06] uh and the whole church, we need one
[1:09:08] another. Amen. Amen. Amen. And the
[1:09:11] faithful mothers and sisters. And you
[1:09:14] know, it's not there's no one class
[1:09:16] higher, one class lower. We are all
[1:09:18] equal. Amen. Amen.
[1:09:29] I thought my iPad was also the battery
[1:09:32] died would be a speech without the note.
[1:09:37] I will invite you to go to Ephesians 6.
[1:09:44] Ephesians 6 1013.
[1:10:08] Am I doing something wrong? Is it okay?
[1:10:11] It's fine. Let me try. Maybe.
[1:10:17] So, Ephesians 6 10:18
[1:10:20] you're there but I'm not there myself.
[1:10:27] I shared that recently and I thought
[1:10:29] that's to share that again. And the
[1:10:32] Bible says in verse verse 10 says
[1:10:35] finally my brethren be strong in the
[1:10:37] Lord and in the power of his might.
[1:10:40] Amen. Put on the whole armor of God that
[1:10:44] you may be able to stand against the ws
[1:10:48] of the devil. For we wrestle not against
[1:10:51] flesh and blood, but against
[1:10:54] principalities, against powers, against
[1:10:56] the rulers of the darkness of this
[1:10:58] world, against spiritual wickedness in
[1:11:02] high places. Wherefore take unto you the
[1:11:05] whole armor of God that you may be able
[1:11:08] to withstand in the evil day and having
[1:11:11] done all to stand. Stand therefore,
[1:11:15] having your loins girth about with
[1:11:17] truth, and having on the breastplate of
[1:11:20] righteousness, and your feet showed with
[1:11:23] the preparation of the gospel of peace,
[1:11:26] and above all, taking the shield of
[1:11:28] faith, where you shall be able to quench
[1:11:31] all the fiery darts of the wicked, and
[1:11:34] take the helmet of salvation, and the
[1:11:37] sword of the spirit, which is the word
[1:11:39] of God. Amen. praying always with all
[1:11:42] prayer and supplication in the spirit
[1:11:45] and watching the unto with all
[1:11:47] perseverance and supplication of all
[1:11:50] saints. May God bless his word. You can
[1:11:52] have a seat.
[1:12:02] I'd like to speak this morning about
[1:12:04] taking the whole armor of God to resist
[1:12:08] the devil. Amen. Take the whole armor of
[1:12:11] God to resist the devil.
[1:12:13] As the Bible tells us, put on the whole
[1:12:16] armor of God. Not just the partial, not
[1:12:19] just take a portion here and leave some
[1:12:21] part there, but we need to take the
[1:12:23] whole armor of God in order to fight
[1:12:26] properly this fight we are in against
[1:12:29] the devil. Amen. Because we have been
[1:12:31] called to resist the enemy. Amen. James
[1:12:35] 4:7 says, "Submit yourself therefore to
[1:12:38] God. Resist the devil and he will flee
[1:12:41] from you. Amen. Resist the devil. We
[1:12:44] have been called to resist the devil.
[1:12:47] And as I was sharing the other time and
[1:12:49] I thought I will share it again here if
[1:12:51] it's possible by God's grace. Um we have
[1:12:55] been called to resist the devil. I think
[1:12:57] brother Andrew will hear twice but we
[1:12:58] have been called to resist the devil.
[1:13:00] Amen.
[1:13:02] When we resist the devil there are two
[1:13:03] ways to resist the devil. You can he or
[1:13:06] you stand and fight against the devil.
[1:13:08] But I'm going to shock you with another
[1:13:09] way here. Let's a little bit as before I
[1:13:12] go to the main thought here. Sometimes
[1:13:14] you have to resist the devil by running
[1:13:17] away from the devil. Sometimes you have
[1:13:20] to resist the devil by running. But it
[1:13:22] sounds like contrary. How can I resist
[1:13:24] by running away? But sometimes the your
[1:13:27] defense and your best defense will be to
[1:13:29] run away from the devil. 1 Thessalonians
[1:13:32] 5:22 says, "Abstain from all appearance
[1:13:36] of evil." Amen. And the very God of
[1:13:38] peace sanctify you holy. And I pray God
[1:13:41] your holy spirit and soul and body be
[1:13:43] preserved blameless unto the coming of
[1:13:46] our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is he
[1:13:49] that called you who also will do. So
[1:13:51] sometimes you have to abstain and not
[1:13:54] even sometimes some you have to we have
[1:13:56] to abstain from all appearance of evil.
[1:13:59] Amen. We have to run away from all
[1:14:01] appearance of evil. Amen. If you have
[1:14:04] you having bad influences you prophecy
[1:14:06] around the place. If you're having bad
[1:14:07] influences, you're among bad influences,
[1:14:10] you are in the wrong place to be. You
[1:14:12] have to run away from bad influences,
[1:14:15] from bad friends, and from bad
[1:14:16] environments. Don't go in the devil's
[1:14:19] ground and say, "No, I'm here to defeat
[1:14:21] you, the devil, but in the devil's
[1:14:23] ground." No, you have to run away from
[1:14:25] the devil's ground. You have to run away
[1:14:27] from bad influences. You have to run
[1:14:30] away from bad friends. You have to run
[1:14:32] away from anyone else who's anything
[1:14:34] else that is pulling you down. You have
[1:14:36] to run away from it. Don't take yourself
[1:14:39] that I'm too spiritual. I can stand it.
[1:14:41] I can stay in this environment. Run away
[1:14:43] from those kinds of environment because
[1:14:45] they're going to put you down. Amen. If
[1:14:48] you go to a wrong website, you have to
[1:14:50] run away from that wrong website. If
[1:14:52] you're in the wrong environment with
[1:14:53] friends, you have to run away from that
[1:14:55] wrong environmental friends. Amen.
[1:14:57] Because that's a way to resist the
[1:14:59] devil. Amen. The prophet says, I'm going
[1:15:02] to back it up with what prophet says,
[1:15:04] and I like to read a prophet says,
[1:15:06] prodical says, I don't care who the boy
[1:15:08] is, who the girl is, if they are not
[1:15:10] saved, keep away from them. That's
[1:15:12] exactly right. And men, men, you too,
[1:15:15] somebody said, well, I can go into the
[1:15:17] bow with a guy. I can drink a coke while
[1:15:20] he drinks beer and whiskey and come back
[1:15:22] and be the same person. The prophet
[1:15:24] says, I doubt it. Says, oh no, I'm too
[1:15:26] spiritual. I can go in the barroom. It's
[1:15:28] okay with me. I can stay there and no,
[1:15:31] you have to run away from those things
[1:15:34] because that's the way God has given you
[1:15:36] as a way of running of of defense of
[1:15:39] resisting the devil. Amen. Run away like
[1:15:42] a coward sometimes.
[1:15:45] You know, run away as a coward and it
[1:15:47] comes in those things. You know, Joseph
[1:15:49] when he was struggling with that woman's
[1:15:52] the Portiva's wife, he didn't want he
[1:15:54] didn't stay there and says, you know
[1:15:55] what, I'm too spiritual here. I'm going
[1:15:57] to convince her. I'm going to make her
[1:16:00] become a message believer. No, no, no,
[1:16:02] no, no, no, no. The way to resist was to
[1:16:05] run. He run for his life. Amen. You see
[1:16:08] a danger, run for your life. Amen. You
[1:16:10] see that you're weak in certain areas.
[1:16:12] Don't expose yourself to that weakness.
[1:16:15] Don't stay there. You need to cover that
[1:16:17] weak spot. Amen. Because the devil will
[1:16:20] come to the weak spot all the time. We
[1:16:21] come to the weak. Maybe it might be
[1:16:23] lust. Maybe it might be temper. Maybe it
[1:16:25] might be gossiping. Maybe. So run away
[1:16:27] from all the different things where you
[1:16:28] know a weak spot. You run away from
[1:16:30] that. You cover that spot. You take the
[1:16:32] word of God. You take the blood of Jesus
[1:16:34] Christ. Amen. To cover yourself.
[1:16:36] Exactly. Amen. Amen. So we are not
[1:16:39] called to be on the borderline to see
[1:16:41] how close we get to see. Don't don't
[1:16:44] stay how close you can get to see
[1:16:46] without seeing. The prophet says see how
[1:16:48] far you can stay away from it. That's
[1:16:51] the thing to do. Don't never see how
[1:16:53] close you can go you can go to sin. and
[1:16:56] see how far you can stay away. Oh, I'm a
[1:16:59] believer. For me, it's fine with me. I
[1:17:01] can do this. No, don't don't don't
[1:17:03] belittle don't don't don't belittle what
[1:17:06] the devil can do. Or don't don't
[1:17:09] compromise with the word of God thinking
[1:17:11] that you are more spiritual than what
[1:17:13] the word of God allows you to do. Amen.
[1:17:16] You see a car coming, you see a car, let
[1:17:20] me put a contrast here. Sometimes you
[1:17:22] don't need to pray, you need to run
[1:17:24] away.
[1:17:27] So now I'm going to pray. No, you you
[1:17:29] don't need to pray. You need to run
[1:17:30] away. You see a car coming in full
[1:17:33] speed. You're in the middle of the road.
[1:17:35] Don't stay in the middle of road and you
[1:17:37] start making a long prayer of faith. No,
[1:17:40] your your way is to run away from the
[1:17:42] road and maybe you pray on the side of
[1:17:44] the road. Amen. That's the same thing.
[1:17:48] We take that example to show exactly
[1:17:49] where you are. Sometimes in our walk, if
[1:17:52] you don't stay there and say, "No, I'm
[1:17:54] in the middle of this and I'm going stay
[1:17:55] there and I'm going pray." No, you run
[1:17:57] away from the things. Amen. That's
[1:17:58] right. Amen.
[1:18:04] Amen. Amen. John 10 says, "When he put
[1:18:08] forth his own sheep, he goth before them
[1:18:11] and the sheep follow him for they know
[1:18:13] his voice and a stranger will they not
[1:18:15] follow but will flee from the stranger.
[1:18:20] We'll flee from the danger." He don't
[1:18:21] say no the sheep you we are sheep. Amen.
[1:18:24] says no the sheep know you see you hear
[1:18:26] not certain voice you know sometimes the
[1:18:28] message now within the message and when
[1:18:30] message goes through many cycles and
[1:18:32] some we see people coming and resisting
[1:18:34] the message now there some people who
[1:18:37] have faithful and now if you if you see
[1:18:39] that he start getting away from the
[1:18:41] message and criticizing the message the
[1:18:43] prophet says here but you know what I
[1:18:45] have a different opinion that a
[1:18:47] dangerous zone already know that's my
[1:18:49] opinion that you know what that the
[1:18:51] prophet that was the it was during his
[1:18:54] time and now things have evolved. It's
[1:18:56] not the same way as in this time. Be
[1:18:58] careful. Amen. The word of God has no
[1:19:00] age. The word of God is eternal. The
[1:19:02] word of God is God himself. Amen. So if
[1:19:05] you see that, you know, don't stay down
[1:19:07] and start reasoning. Run away from it.
[1:19:09] Flee because you are a sheep. A sheep
[1:19:12] defense is sometimes is to run away from
[1:19:14] the danger. And John 10 says 10, John
[1:19:18] 10:10, the thief cometh not but to steal
[1:19:21] and to kill and to destroy. That's what
[1:19:23] the enemy there. He's there to look
[1:19:25] after to look after you or to go after
[1:19:27] you to steal and to kill and to destroy.
[1:19:30] His aim is to destroy the faith. The aim
[1:19:32] is to to to bring discouragement. His
[1:19:35] aim is to to bring fear. That way he's
[1:19:37] there. He's there just to bring
[1:19:39] sometimes discord. He's there to bring
[1:19:42] division. That what the enemy is there.
[1:19:44] He doesn't want unity. He want division.
[1:19:46] He's there to steal, to kill. You have a
[1:19:49] experience with God. You are walking
[1:19:50] with God. He's not happy. You want you
[1:19:52] want to put doubt. You want to put fear.
[1:19:55] You want to stop you in your walk.
[1:19:56] That's what the enemy is there. We are
[1:19:58] in a fight. We are not in a picnic. We
[1:20:00] are in a fight. We in a war. Then the
[1:20:03] enemy knows that since we are born and
[1:20:05] he's studying you. He sees how you
[1:20:07] behave. He is watching over. He's
[1:20:09] watching over you. He's looking. He's
[1:20:12] looking for a for a place where he can
[1:20:14] get him. That's the enemy of the enemy.
[1:20:16] But I'm not here to bring fear. I'm
[1:20:17] going to show that the enemy wants
[1:20:20] something. He want to destroy us. But
[1:20:21] God is with us. Amen. We just need to
[1:20:24] stay and use the whole armor of God
[1:20:27] because it's always able to defeat the
[1:20:29] enemy. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:20:32] Says, I'm come that they might have life
[1:20:34] and that they might have it more
[1:20:36] abundantly. What a promise. I am the
[1:20:38] good shepherd and the good shepherd
[1:20:40] giveth his life for the sheep. Amen.
[1:20:44] Amen. We know the story and the story of
[1:20:46] Nelly Sanders. Nelly Sanders was a girl
[1:20:49] who used to be a musician or something
[1:20:51] like that if I'm not if I'm recalling
[1:20:53] properly. And one time she made a
[1:20:55] mistake to just go into a place where
[1:20:58] they were playing some music.
[1:21:01] Says, "You know what? Listen what she
[1:21:03] says. Greatest battle I ever thought."
[1:21:05] That's my thought of this message. Maybe
[1:21:07] if I walk up on the step up there and
[1:21:09] said, "Maybe I'll be able to testify to
[1:21:12] some of them. Oh my, I'm a Christian
[1:21:15] now. let me go in that room and the
[1:21:16] place and I will testify to all those
[1:21:19] drunkers and every oh because I about
[1:21:21] Christ it sounds like a good intention
[1:21:24] but you see you are right on the devil's
[1:21:27] ground the prophet says stay out of it
[1:21:30] shun the very appearance of evil and she
[1:21:33] walked out in the top of the step and
[1:21:34] stood out a few minutes and the first
[1:21:36] thing you know she was in somebody's arm
[1:21:39] out on the floor oh and then she come to
[1:21:42] herself and she was standing there
[1:21:44] crying and going on said, "Oh, I'm lost
[1:21:46] now for good. I'm lost." And then, you
[1:21:48] know, an evil spirit came into her. A
[1:21:51] spirit like an evil bat came into her
[1:21:54] and then she had to run away and go come
[1:21:55] to the prophet. I'm lost. I'm lost. And
[1:21:57] the prophet was and I had to pray for
[1:21:59] her and the prophet like to pray that he
[1:22:01] prayed for her God. I know that she made
[1:22:03] a mistake. The mistake is she waited.
[1:22:06] She stopped for a minute. Sometime don't
[1:22:09] stop for a minute for the devil. It does
[1:22:12] not deserve any of our any minute. Amen.
[1:22:15] Anything of the devil, just run away
[1:22:17] from it. Don't stop for any minute for
[1:22:19] the devil. She made a mistake there.
[1:22:21] That's where she made the mistake. The
[1:22:23] devil or the bride should not stop for
[1:22:26] the devil. Should not make give any
[1:22:28] minute to the devil. I'm talking to the
[1:22:30] young people. I'm to the grownup people.
[1:22:32] Don't give the devil any minute. Amen.
[1:22:35] Amen. Give your soul, give your mind,
[1:22:37] give your body to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:22:40] He's the one who died for us. Amen. He's
[1:22:42] the one who deserve our whole being.
[1:22:44] Amen. We are here to serve him. Amen.
[1:22:47] And then she made that mistake. The
[1:22:49] prophet rebuked the enemy. The enemy, I
[1:22:50] know she made a mistake, but now I'm
[1:22:52] coming as a servant of God. I'm praying
[1:22:54] for her. Let it be delivered. Amen. And
[1:22:57] that bat flew away. Amen. The prophet
[1:23:00] says sometimes we don't believe in
[1:23:01] demons. Demons are there. Oh yeah. So
[1:23:04] sometime they come invisible then oh
[1:23:07] ugly things but they are there. Demons
[1:23:08] are there. What makes you sleep in
[1:23:11] church? It's a demon.
[1:23:13] Sometimes you work over time and but
[1:23:16] sometimes a demon just there. Oh, but
[1:23:19] when you are doing enjoying your life,
[1:23:21] everything is fine. The minute you leave
[1:23:23] the church, everything is fine. But when
[1:23:25] you in here, oh, just a little bit 10
[1:23:27] minutes and you start,
[1:23:30] oh, the devil is there.
[1:23:33] Amen.
[1:23:36] That's true.
[1:23:41] So I got Nelly and took her home and
[1:23:43] says she stopped for a moment and that's
[1:23:46] all. Don't stop at all. When God sings
[1:23:49] his word in your heart, just take that
[1:23:51] sword and start chopping and cutting.
[1:23:54] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:24:00] But sometimes
[1:24:05] you don't go in the ground of the enemy.
[1:24:08] You don't go in the ground of enemy but
[1:24:10] the enemy comes to you. And the enemy
[1:24:13] will come to you. The enemy is always
[1:24:14] coming to us. As I'm here speaking,
[1:24:17] sometimes the enemy is coming in your
[1:24:18] mind. Sometimes the enemy is coming in
[1:24:20] my mind. You are thinking and all and
[1:24:22] you're being distracted. And the
[1:24:24] preacher is also sometime thinking this
[1:24:25] right there. Look at the people. Oh,
[1:24:27] maybe they're not listening to what I'm
[1:24:28] saying. Oh, no. Different things going
[1:24:30] in our mind. Is that correct? And we
[1:24:32] know the enemy, the enemy is allowed to
[1:24:34] put any thought. But we should not let
[1:24:36] him let that thought remain in us. He's
[1:24:40] allowed to put the thought, but we have
[1:24:41] to reject that thought. We have to
[1:24:43] resist that that thought. Trying to put
[1:24:46] the thought of negativity, you have to
[1:24:47] reject it. You want to put the thought
[1:24:49] of hatred, you have to reject it. You
[1:24:51] want to put the thought of complex of
[1:24:53] complex, you have to reject it. Our job
[1:24:56] is to reject the thought of the enemy.
[1:24:58] Our job is to reject what the enemy is
[1:25:00] trying to inject. Amen. That the work we
[1:25:03] are in, we have to resist the enemy. We
[1:25:06] have to resist the devil. And the
[1:25:08] promise is he will flee away. Not run
[1:25:10] away. Not not even walking away. He will
[1:25:13] flee away. He will run away. Amen. So we
[1:25:16] are in the winning side. Amen. Amen.
[1:25:20] The prophet says you will get to the
[1:25:23] place you say well brother Bill I have
[1:25:26] so many temptations
[1:25:28] tell me one Christian that doesn't have
[1:25:30] temptation
[1:25:31] we never come to a picnic we've come to
[1:25:33] a battleground we are here to fight the
[1:25:37] enemy why sure why sure we don't put on
[1:25:41] our whole ar we don't put on our armor
[1:25:44] just to be looked at
[1:25:46] if you become a Christian you be if you
[1:25:49] become a Christian just to be looked at.
[1:25:52] Then I'm afraid you've got in the wrong
[1:25:55] place.
[1:25:56] Now I'm a message believer. Now I let me
[1:25:59] rest and everything is fine. Now I'm in
[1:26:01] a picnic. I'm at peace and everything.
[1:26:04] And shalom in the soul, but in the mind
[1:26:07] there's still a fight. Amen. It will
[1:26:09] come. The enemy is already there coming
[1:26:11] and fight. Might be in the mind, might
[1:26:13] be in the flesh. The the soul is
[1:26:15] redeemed, but the flesh is not redeemed.
[1:26:17] The mind is not redeemed. So the enemy
[1:26:19] will come down all the time. He will
[1:26:21] come to temptation and he will come
[1:26:23] there. And if he comes there, we have to
[1:26:25] take the weapon of the word of God. Be
[1:26:28] strong in the Lord. We have to be strong
[1:26:31] in the Lord. Amen. Be strong in the
[1:26:34] Lord. We should not take and and adopt a
[1:26:36] fatalistic attitude. You know, I'm a
[1:26:38] predestinated seed and everything. I'm
[1:26:41] just rest there and and become passive
[1:26:43] and and let it everything go. Let let
[1:26:46] others fight. I'll just come and do my
[1:26:48] regular religious
[1:26:50] no routines and everything. No, we are
[1:26:53] in active combat. We are fighting a real
[1:26:56] enemy and that enemy is trying to
[1:26:59] destroy, to steal, to destroy our
[1:27:01] families, to destroy our marriages, to
[1:27:03] destroy our church, to destroy our life,
[1:27:06] to destroy our bodies. That the enemy is
[1:27:09] after all those things. But we are more
[1:27:11] than conqueror in Jesus Christ. Because
[1:27:15] he has already prevailed. Amen. That's
[1:27:17] what we are here to tell the enemy. We
[1:27:19] are going to stand on the word of God.
[1:27:22] Because the word of God will defeat the
[1:27:24] enemy anytime, any place, under any
[1:27:27] circumstances. The word of God is God
[1:27:30] himself. Amen. God doesn't have to
[1:27:32] upgrade his weapon. Amen. You know in
[1:27:35] the world they have to upgrade the
[1:27:36] weapon. The weapon for the first world
[1:27:38] war is not efficient in the was not
[1:27:40] efficient in the second world war. It's
[1:27:42] not efficient today. Amen. You might not
[1:27:44] maybe I put this somewhere but you know
[1:27:46] now that I was looking the in the news
[1:27:48] and things like that. You know Ukraine
[1:27:50] is used in the war in Ukraine and the
[1:27:52] war in Gaza they've seen that the
[1:27:54] weapons have really upgraded to a level
[1:27:56] where if you fight with the weapons of
[1:27:59] 10 years ago oh you will be well
[1:28:01] defeated. Now you need drones
[1:28:03] sophisticated drones. You need to see
[1:28:04] the enemy before he comes. You need to
[1:28:06] see their plan before he come because if
[1:28:08] the enemy is already in your land, it
[1:28:10] might be hard to take him without. So
[1:28:12] you they have to upgrade those weapons.
[1:28:14] But God does not have to upgrade any
[1:28:16] weapon because he has already given us
[1:28:19] the word of God. Amen. Take the word for
[1:28:22] every situation and apply the word of
[1:28:24] God, you are bound to be an overcomer.
[1:28:27] Amen. Amen.
[1:28:30] Amen. Amen.
[1:28:33] So the issue is not even to resist the
[1:28:35] enemy. The issue is what do you
[1:28:38] use to resist the enemy?
[1:28:42] Ephesians 6 says Paul is talking to the
[1:28:45] born again Christians. He says put on
[1:28:47] the whole armor of God.
[1:28:50] Repeat again not only a part of it but
[1:28:53] if because if you take a part of it you
[1:28:55] won't be able to resist properly. 1
[1:28:58] Peter 5
[1:29:00] 7:11 says, "Casting all your care upon
[1:29:03] him." That's right. Let's take our Bible
[1:29:05] and read First Peter 5.
[1:29:20] the small church, you know, I grew up in
[1:29:23] a small church and sometimes the
[1:29:25] preacher will be preaching say, "No, I'm
[1:29:26] not preaching myself." So, someone reads
[1:29:28] the Bible there and someone reads the
[1:29:31] Bible and make everybody participate. I
[1:29:33] won't make everybody part. Take your
[1:29:35] Bible and read.
[1:29:36] And we were careful to bring the Bible.
[1:29:38] Now,
[1:29:40] first Peter 5 says, "Casting all your
[1:29:43] care upon him, for he carth for you."
[1:29:46] Isn't that beautiful?
[1:29:48] Be sober. Be vigilant because your
[1:29:51] adversary, the devil, as a roaring lion.
[1:29:55] He's not a real lion, but he's acting
[1:29:57] like a roaring lion. He's behaving like
[1:30:00] a roaring lion. So, it's a fake lion.
[1:30:02] He's a fake lion. He's there. He is
[1:30:04] trying. What is he's doing? He's walking
[1:30:06] about. He's seeking whom he may devour,
[1:30:10] but whom you have to resist steadfast in
[1:30:14] the faith,
[1:30:16] knowing that the same afflictions are
[1:30:18] accomplished in your brethren that are
[1:30:20] in the world. How can you resist the
[1:30:22] devil? You have to resist the devil in
[1:30:25] the faith. You have to steadfast in the
[1:30:28] faith of God. Amen. What is the fa How
[1:30:30] can you have faith? By reading the word
[1:30:32] of God. Amen. Faith comes by hearing and
[1:30:35] hearing of the word of God. You cannot
[1:30:38] have faith faith by reading something
[1:30:40] else because the Holy Spirit feeds only
[1:30:43] upon the word of God. So in order to
[1:30:46] resist the enemy, we need to resist any
[1:30:48] enemy in the faith and the faith comes
[1:30:51] by hearing of the word of God. And God
[1:30:53] has given us the word of God in order to
[1:30:56] increase our faith. Amen. Amen. Amen. So
[1:30:59] it's a resistance. It's a fight. It's a
[1:31:02] resistance, a fight. And it's not only a
[1:31:04] fight, not only a resistance the flesh,
[1:31:06] but it's a fight in the mind. And the
[1:31:08] greatest battle ever fought is a
[1:31:10] spiritual warfare. That's right.
[1:31:13] Do you know that Ephesians 1:3 when it
[1:31:16] says
[1:31:18] or Ephesians 6 says we wrestle not
[1:31:22] against the flesh and the blood but
[1:31:23] against principalities against powers
[1:31:26] against the rulers of the darkness of
[1:31:28] this world against spiritual wickedness
[1:31:30] in high places. those high places is the
[1:31:33] same word that has been used in
[1:31:35] Ephesians 1:3 that we are blessed God
[1:31:38] and father our lord Jesus Christ who has
[1:31:40] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[1:31:42] in heavenly places in Christ the devil
[1:31:46] you come to church been blessed by the
[1:31:49] word of God you have a wonderful Sunday
[1:31:51] service wonderful Wednesday service and
[1:31:53] what the next things are coming the next
[1:31:55] morning sometimes not even next day
[1:31:57] sometimes just after church the devil
[1:31:59] will try to distract to take that
[1:32:01] blessing that God gave you. Why? Because
[1:32:04] he doesn't want you to be staying and
[1:32:06] enjoying the blessings of God in in in
[1:32:08] heavenly places. That's the way he's
[1:32:11] coming. He's trying to to destroy. He
[1:32:12] want to take the joy of salvation. He's
[1:32:15] trying to to take the faith for your
[1:32:17] forgiveness of your sins. He doesn't
[1:32:18] want you to enjoy the blessings of God,
[1:32:20] the promise of God. I'm healed. I'm
[1:32:23] sick, but I'm healed. The devil doesn't
[1:32:25] want you to grasp the blessing of God.
[1:32:28] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:32:31] Amen. But listen what the word of God
[1:32:33] says.
[1:32:35] 2 Corinthians 10:3 says, "For though we
[1:32:38] walk in the flesh, we do not war after
[1:32:40] the flesh. For the weapons of our
[1:32:42] warfare are not carnal, but mighty
[1:32:44] through God to the pulling down of
[1:32:46] strongholds, casting down imaginations."
[1:32:50] It means reasoning. Casting down
[1:32:52] reasoning because the devil's weapon is
[1:32:55] reasoning. You want to give reasoning.
[1:32:57] You want the prophet to say in one place
[1:33:00] that what the devil came to Eve was not
[1:33:03] necessary to deny the whole word. He
[1:33:06] just wanted to give her a reason to say
[1:33:09] it makes sense what you are saying.
[1:33:12] Sometimes that's what the enemy wants
[1:33:13] just to bring you bring you bring me to
[1:33:16] the place where I can say or you can say
[1:33:18] it makes sense what you are saying. But
[1:33:20] if anything makes sense that is outside
[1:33:23] of the word of God don't take it. Amen.
[1:33:26] We have to take the whole word of God.
[1:33:29] Making sense is not how the believer
[1:33:32] lives. The believer lives by faith in
[1:33:34] the word of God. That's our defense.
[1:33:38] That's our place of refuge is the whole
[1:33:41] word of God. What does the prophet says
[1:33:44] about these situations? What does the
[1:33:46] Bible says about these situations? If we
[1:33:49] have that ability to judge everything,
[1:33:51] to filter everything through the word of
[1:33:54] God, we will always turn out to be safe.
[1:33:56] Amen. We cannot rely on our own
[1:33:59] reasoning. How many intelligent people
[1:34:02] are there? Then they have the different
[1:34:04] opinions.
[1:34:06] We can't rely on our own opinions. But
[1:34:08] why? We need to have the mind of Christ.
[1:34:11] And the headship came down to give us
[1:34:14] the mind of Christ.
[1:34:17] That's right.
[1:34:18] Amen. So, casting down imaginations,
[1:34:21] every high thing that exaltth itself
[1:34:24] against the knowledge of God and
[1:34:26] bringing into captivity every thought to
[1:34:29] the obedience of Christ. That's where we
[1:34:32] have to that's how we have to resist the
[1:34:34] enemy. He gives you a thought, you know,
[1:34:36] you you you're sick. You you you know,
[1:34:38] you you'll never be healed or
[1:34:41] you bring a fear of cancer, you know, or
[1:34:44] all those things.
[1:34:46] But what is cancer before God?
[1:34:50] What is whatever name that they give
[1:34:52] before God is the omnipotent God. Take
[1:34:55] that thought and put it captive to the
[1:34:57] word of God. Amen. Make it subject to
[1:35:00] the word of God. Satan, you have to obey
[1:35:02] the word of God. I'm not powerful, but
[1:35:05] the word of God is more than powerful.
[1:35:07] Amen. You're not fighting against me.
[1:35:09] You are fighting against my Lord,
[1:35:11] against the word of God. Is your
[1:35:13] overcomer. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. So
[1:35:17] that way we have to do we have to cast
[1:35:19] down bring into captivity every thought
[1:35:22] to the obedience of Christ. Amen. That's
[1:35:25] how we can resist it fast in the faith.
[1:35:28] The prophet says
[1:35:31] the contrast says and God when he gave
[1:35:33] his people the best thing that he could
[1:35:34] do to combat Satan with was his word.
[1:35:38] Now because the word is God and what's
[1:35:40] strongest what's stronger than God? The
[1:35:43] word is God and the word becomes our
[1:35:45] strength. God in the church becomes his
[1:35:48] strength to pull Satan to his own fires
[1:35:50] that he has made. And the tag goes on.
[1:35:53] Now Jesus said in Mark 16, in my name
[1:35:57] they shall cast out devils. Amen.
[1:36:02] When I read that, it just makes me happy
[1:36:06] because God is stronger than anything.
[1:36:09] It's not my battle. It's the Lord's
[1:36:11] battle. Amen. Oh, for my children, it's
[1:36:13] not my fight. It's the Lord's fight. For
[1:36:16] my health, it's not my fight. It's the
[1:36:18] Lord's fight. Whatever I'm struggling in
[1:36:20] my work, God knows my desires. It's not
[1:36:22] my fight. It's the Lord's fight. I'm
[1:36:25] just going to stay behind the word of
[1:36:27] God. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:36:31] Save time.
[1:36:35] Through the ages, we know the prophet
[1:36:37] will take that in the in the fifth seal
[1:36:39] and and say it so so long. So well
[1:36:41] through the ages we saw that this enemy
[1:36:44] came through different beasts of
[1:36:46] different horse riders and horse means
[1:36:49] power different anointing that came to
[1:36:52] fight in to fight against the church and
[1:36:55] different different horse rider that
[1:36:57] come. It was the white the white one. It
[1:37:00] was the black one the red one the black
[1:37:02] one and the pale one that now we in the
[1:37:04] age we are living in. So different
[1:37:06] spirit came and to fight against the
[1:37:08] church to bring it down to destroy it.
[1:37:11] But God was not left alone. God didn't
[1:37:14] leave the church defenseless. The bride
[1:37:16] is not defenseless. Amen. God had to
[1:37:18] send an anointing to fight that spirit.
[1:37:21] And God was always faithful and ahead of
[1:37:24] the curve to fight that anoint that bad
[1:37:27] anointing that was coming up against the
[1:37:29] bride. God doesn't leave his bride faith
[1:37:32] def defenseless. The bride has the
[1:37:34] anointing by which she can overcome. And
[1:37:37] now we are under the flying eagle
[1:37:39] anointing to fight the enemy. Amen. Now
[1:37:43] the anointing that we have received is
[1:37:46] not only you know in in the previous one
[1:37:48] the lion anointing though as strong and
[1:37:50] powerful as it was or the ox anointing
[1:37:53] or the man anointing as as hard as
[1:37:55] strong and powerful as it was but they
[1:37:58] had to fight the enemy when the enemy
[1:37:59] comes already in the camp. When the
[1:38:02] enemy is already in the camp then they
[1:38:03] have to fight when then they realize oh
[1:38:05] it's here and we have false teaching and
[1:38:07] then they fight and then that teaching
[1:38:09] ministry of the lion has to fight that
[1:38:11] the anointing but the eagle anointing is
[1:38:14] the anointing where to fly above and to
[1:38:17] see the danger before it comes. That's
[1:38:20] why we have so privileged to have a
[1:38:22] prophet who has warned us about things
[1:38:25] way before. I think I said that last
[1:38:27] time and I'll keep repeating it. He has
[1:38:28] warned us about things way before
[1:38:30] because he has a legal anointing. He
[1:38:33] flies above and warns us before it
[1:38:35] arrives. Amen. So we are living and
[1:38:38] accepting and feeding on a prophetic
[1:38:40] word of God that it can never fail.
[1:38:43] Amen. Because before it comes, God has
[1:38:46] already provided a way to fight against
[1:38:48] it. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:38:53] In order to have the right discernment
[1:38:55] of the things that happening now in the
[1:38:58] world, in order to be saved, in order to
[1:39:01] be to write to have even the best
[1:39:02] decisions,
[1:39:04] you cannot rely on what you hear on the
[1:39:06] news or the opinions of people. We thank
[1:39:09] God that we have to take the eagle
[1:39:10] anointing that have seen the danger
[1:39:13] before it arrives, even small as might
[1:39:15] be, even as innocent as it might be to
[1:39:18] warn us against it and to fight against
[1:39:21] it. Amen. You might see, but why is the
[1:39:23] pastor so hard upon those small things?
[1:39:25] Just small things. It's an eagle
[1:39:27] anointing. You see the dangers when it's
[1:39:29] still small because he doesn't want you
[1:39:31] to come to the camp. Why is the deacon
[1:39:34] so hard on people and he he has the
[1:39:36] eagle anointing. Amen. He can see the
[1:39:39] danger before it even arrives. Amen. We
[1:39:42] should rely on God's grace. Amen.
[1:39:46] Why Christ speak?
[1:39:48] Prophet says faith sees what God wants
[1:39:51] done and I hope this go this goes in.
[1:39:55] Faith doesn't look at the present time.
[1:39:58] Faith doesn't see this here. Faith looks
[1:40:00] to see what God wants and it works
[1:40:03] accordingly. That's what faith does. It
[1:40:06] sees what God wants and what God wants
[1:40:09] done. Faith operates through that. Faith
[1:40:13] is a long range vision. It doesn't lower
[1:40:16] its sight. It holds that target. Amen.
[1:40:19] Any good shooter knows that that's a
[1:40:21] long range. It's a telescope. It's a
[1:40:23] binocular that you don't look around
[1:40:25] here. You don't use binocular to see
[1:40:28] what time it is. You don't use that for
[1:40:30] that. But you use binocular to look a
[1:40:33] way off. Amen. Are you with me this
[1:40:35] morning? Faith does that. Faith picks up
[1:40:38] God's binocular, both of them, and both
[1:40:41] sides, the new and old testament, and
[1:40:43] sees every promise that he made. Amen.
[1:40:46] Faith sees it out young and faith
[1:40:48] chooses that regardless of what the
[1:40:51] present tense says here. It can apply to
[1:40:54] our spiritual work. It is apply to our
[1:40:56] family. It can apply to to whatever
[1:40:58] situation you're going through. Don't
[1:41:00] look at the present tense. Don't look at
[1:41:03] the symptoms. Don't look at the
[1:41:06] negativity.
[1:41:07] Take the binocular to God's word and see
[1:41:10] what God's promises has given you. Amen.
[1:41:14] That's where you have to look at. Amen.
[1:41:16] The devil will come and point out the
[1:41:19] things around you. See you are sick. You
[1:41:21] see you can't make it. You see you made
[1:41:23] a promise to God there yesterday but
[1:41:25] today you fails again and you fail
[1:41:27] again. And you look at the things here.
[1:41:30] But if you're a Christian, you hold on
[1:41:32] God's promise. I'm not going to look at
[1:41:34] the present tense here. I'm going to
[1:41:36] look at God's promise. Amen. I'm healed
[1:41:39] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. I'm saved
[1:41:42] in Jesus Christ's name. I will have a
[1:41:44] clean heart life by Jesus Christ name.
[1:41:46] My children are saved by Jesus Christ
[1:41:49] name. Amen.
[1:41:53] Says he looks at the end. He doesn't
[1:41:55] drop his side down to look at this way.
[1:41:57] He looks out yonder. He keeps the
[1:41:58] crosshair dead center on the word.
[1:42:03] That's what faith does. Amen. That's the
[1:42:05] faith that's in a man that does those
[1:42:07] things. Amen.
[1:42:10] Amen.
[1:42:12] You see
[1:42:15] wisdom versus faith. The prophet says
[1:42:16] there are only two source that we can
[1:42:18] draw our life from. One of them is
[1:42:21] wisdom and the other is faith. We think
[1:42:24] that wisdom produces and what faith
[1:42:27] produces.
[1:42:29] Satan today two sources still introduced
[1:42:31] in the human race. We find out that God
[1:42:33] was the order of faith and to believe
[1:42:35] and for the people to believe and to
[1:42:37] trust his word. Satan is the order of
[1:42:40] wisdom trying to get the people to
[1:42:41] accept his wisdom and to pull them away
[1:42:44] from the faith that's in God's word. So
[1:42:46] we see two sources.
[1:42:49] One source will be the wisdom to make
[1:42:51] you think, to make you reason, to make
[1:42:55] you rely on the five senses of the
[1:42:58] flesh, on the five senses of the spirit.
[1:43:02] That's where the enemy will try to work
[1:43:04] on it. The greatest battle ever thought
[1:43:06] is in the mind. Amen. Coming to your
[1:43:09] mind, discouragement and coming pointing
[1:43:12] deception and things to make you reason
[1:43:14] and look at things negative things, you
[1:43:16] know, or someone says something wrong.
[1:43:18] Sometimes they didn't even say it. But
[1:43:20] you so if you believe that someone says
[1:43:22] something wrong and doesn't like you,
[1:43:25] the devil will point you to many things
[1:43:27] that looks like he doesn't like you. You
[1:43:30] see, oh, he doesn't do that. You see, he
[1:43:31] doesn't like you. He confirms what I was
[1:43:32] thinking. Is that you see what you see?
[1:43:35] And you will go on that line and you
[1:43:37] feel like it's really okay and
[1:43:38] everything is going together. But it's
[1:43:41] just a lie of the devil. Don't say
[1:43:44] anything negative against your brother.
[1:43:46] Don't think anything negative against
[1:43:48] your sister. Why? Because the devil
[1:43:50] thought you have to put it under
[1:43:52] obedience of the word of God. If you
[1:43:54] feel like there is something ought, go
[1:43:56] and talk and let it aside. Amen. I was I
[1:43:59] was bothering you. I was I had something
[1:44:01] in my heart of about my brother. So I
[1:44:04] think I have something against my
[1:44:05] brother. I couldn't sleep that night. I
[1:44:07] woke up and I prayed to God I I hope
[1:44:10] there's nothing that you know
[1:44:14] I have to get rid of this thought. So I
[1:44:16] went to talk to the brother. Brother I
[1:44:17] think I'm sorry for I say something the
[1:44:20] other day I say this. Did you get it?
[1:44:21] The brother. Oh no I it didn't even
[1:44:23] cross my mind. Amen.
[1:44:26] It's good I took it out, but I look
[1:44:28] behind a Satan.
[1:44:32] I could have slept.
[1:44:38] Sometimes it's like that. It points you
[1:44:40] to different things, but it's not there.
[1:44:41] Just the mind. Two sources of life. Take
[1:44:44] faith. Don't take wisdom or reasoning.
[1:44:47] That's where the enemy is going. What if
[1:44:49] Abraham had to take reasoning? God tells
[1:44:52] you know Abraham you are going to have a
[1:44:54] son but you are old. The devil was
[1:44:57] certainly pointing to the negative
[1:44:58] things. You see you are old and not only
[1:45:01] you are old but Sarah is also old and
[1:45:03] she can't bear a son. She can't bear a
[1:45:06] child. All the different things had to
[1:45:08] come in his mind working upon his mind.
[1:45:10] But what did what did Abraham did? No I
[1:45:13] reject I reject anything of the devil. I
[1:45:15] reject any thought of the devil. I will
[1:45:18] take the word of God. I will take the
[1:45:19] promise of God. I will hope against any
[1:45:22] hope. I will have faith against any
[1:45:23] doubt. I will doubt my own doubt. Amen.
[1:45:26] And I will have faith in the word of
[1:45:28] God. Amen. I will confess what the word
[1:45:30] of God says rather than what my
[1:45:33] reasoning is bringing me to say. Amen.
[1:45:35] Because the word of God will always be
[1:45:37] true. Amen.
[1:45:41] Amen. Romans 4:17. As it is written, I
[1:45:44] have made thee a father of many nations
[1:45:46] before him whom he believed even God who
[1:45:49] quickenth the dead and calleth those
[1:45:51] things which be not as though they were.
[1:45:54] He does not see them. But Abraham was
[1:45:56] already confessing as if they were.
[1:45:59] Amen. And who against hope believed in
[1:46:02] hope that he might become the father of
[1:46:04] many nations according to that which was
[1:46:07] spoken. So shall thy seed be. And being
[1:46:10] not weak in faith, he considered not his
[1:46:12] own body, now dead when he was about a
[1:46:15] hundred years old, neither yet the
[1:46:17] deadness of S Sarah's womb. Is staggered
[1:46:20] not I like this verse. Is tiger not at
[1:46:22] the promise of God through unbelief.
[1:46:27] He might be feel weak. He might the
[1:46:28] devil might put any thought, but deep
[1:46:31] inside his soul, he believe what the
[1:46:33] word of God says that it will come to
[1:46:36] pass. Amen. And we are the royal seed of
[1:46:39] Abraham. We are taking the word of God.
[1:46:42] No matter what the circumstances are, we
[1:46:45] believe the word of God. Amen.
[1:46:50] That's right. You don't have a believing
[1:46:51] husband. You don't have a believing
[1:46:53] wife. You don't have a believing child.
[1:46:55] Take the word of God and keep pressing
[1:46:58] your Amen. Amen. But was strong in
[1:47:02] faith, giving glory to God. I like that.
[1:47:05] He was giving glory to God. Before
[1:47:07] seeing the result, he's already praising
[1:47:10] God. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[1:47:12] Thank you, Lord. I praise you, Lord.
[1:47:17] That's what the enemy doesn't understand
[1:47:18] about us. We go through trials and
[1:47:20] different things like people from the
[1:47:22] world, they complain and different
[1:47:23] things, but the son of God, oh, thank
[1:47:25] you, Lord. Like we heard that song this,
[1:47:27] thank you, Lord, because you know
[1:47:29] everything right. You will work
[1:47:31] everything at the right season. You are
[1:47:34] God in control. Thank you Lord.
[1:47:37] Giving glory to God. That's how you
[1:47:39] resist the enemy. He will try to put
[1:47:42] discouragement, disappointment,
[1:47:43] negativity. Keep glorifying God and
[1:47:46] confessing that this word is true. Amen.
[1:47:51] And being fully persuaded that what he
[1:47:53] had promised he was able to perform.
[1:47:56] Amen. Amen.
[1:48:00] That's why the proverb says
[1:48:06] position seven church ages. The
[1:48:07] importance of revelation by the spirit
[1:48:09] to a true believer can never be
[1:48:12] overemphasized.
[1:48:14] Revelation means more to you than
[1:48:16] perhaps you realize. Revelation is
[1:48:19] faith. Our faith is our victory.
[1:48:23] Revelation means more to you than
[1:48:24] perhaps you realize. Amen. It is the
[1:48:27] revelation of God that will give you
[1:48:29] authority over the devil. Your faith in
[1:48:32] the word of God will give you authority
[1:48:34] upon over the devil. Amen. You might not
[1:48:37] have power like that policeman. You know
[1:48:40] you can see a car coming physically
[1:48:42] doesn't have power to stop that car but
[1:48:44] he knows the authority behind him. He
[1:48:47] knows what stand behind him. You might
[1:48:49] not have the power physically to fight
[1:48:51] the enemy. But if you stand on God's
[1:48:53] word, it's not you. It's authority of
[1:48:56] whole heaven standing behind you. Amen.
[1:48:59] Because you stand behind the word of
[1:49:00] God. The word of God will stand behind
[1:49:02] you. Amen. You can say to the devil,
[1:49:04] "Stop. Enough is enough. I'm not going
[1:49:07] to hear what you are saying." You ignore
[1:49:08] him completely.
[1:49:12] We need to learn to ignore the devil.
[1:49:14] It's one of the other way to resist the
[1:49:16] Oh, do you resist the devil? Ignore him.
[1:49:18] Don't pay attention to him. He just blah
[1:49:20] blah blah chatter chatter chatter. Oh,
[1:49:22] oh, that's the devil again. Oh, it's you
[1:49:24] again. Oh no no no I don't want to pay
[1:49:25] attention there. I want to stay upon the
[1:49:28] word of God. What does the word of God
[1:49:29] say? I'm healed. Oh thank you Lord. I'm
[1:49:31] healed. The doctor report comes and you
[1:49:33] know you know you can never be healed.
[1:49:35] You know you have to go through this and
[1:49:36] this this. Oh oh oh thank you doctor but
[1:49:39] I'll try to follow the advice as much as
[1:49:41] I can but there is a greater a greater
[1:49:44] doctor than you and that's what I'm
[1:49:46] going to take as the greatest report.
[1:49:47] Amen.
[1:49:50] Amen. Glory to God. Amen.
[1:49:54] the revelation of God that will give you
[1:49:56] authority over the devil. There is
[1:49:58] nothing of such prevailing power as the
[1:50:02] revelation of the word.
[1:50:05] The anchor holds despite the waves,
[1:50:09] despite the troubles, despite all the
[1:50:11] different things,
[1:50:14] we need to cherish that anchor.
[1:50:17] It's stronger than ourself. Yes. As a
[1:50:20] real believer, sometimes you can think,
[1:50:22] "Oh, no. I can get rid of I can just
[1:50:24] leave the message." You cannot leave the
[1:50:25] message. If that anchor is there, it
[1:50:28] will pull you back again. You cannot you
[1:50:31] you cannot be satisfied without that
[1:50:33] that anchor holes. And that's why we
[1:50:36] it's important to feed upon the word of
[1:50:38] God to make that anchor stand even
[1:50:40] further deeper. Like pastor said, let's
[1:50:42] go deeper deeper in the word of God. Let
[1:50:45] that anchor hold. And it's holding.
[1:50:48] Thank God. Amen.
[1:50:53] So don't let the devil make you reason
[1:50:55] that you cannot resist that lust or that
[1:50:57] you cannot overcome that temper or that
[1:51:00] you cannot be healed that can the
[1:51:02] children cannot be saved. Let me tell
[1:51:04] you, you are more than a conqueror to
[1:51:06] Christ who strengthens you. Amen. Amen.
[1:51:20] going to go ahead here. I want to get
[1:51:22] some think here that the best sign in
[1:51:24] the world says
[1:51:27] it says when you take your stand for
[1:51:29] Jesus Christ stay there and die by it.
[1:51:32] God testifying of his gift. God says it
[1:51:34] the truth don't you fear Satan has got
[1:51:38] anything to do about it. Don't argue
[1:51:40] with him. Don't fast with him. Just
[1:51:43] ignore him and walk away. If you fast
[1:51:46] with him, he will keep you fasting day
[1:51:48] and night. See? Well, he will say, you
[1:51:52] know, you are not healed. You'll say,
[1:51:54] well, no. Look, Satan, I want to tell
[1:51:56] you something. Don't say it. Just say,
[1:51:59] get away. Amen. I don't want to hear
[1:52:02] nothing about you.
[1:52:04] And walk on and say, "Thank you, Lord."
[1:52:06] Go on. Don't pay any attention to it.
[1:52:11] Submit yourself therefore to God and
[1:52:13] resist the devil and he will flee from
[1:52:15] you. We need to resist the devil. Amen.
[1:52:19] He will flee from us. Let me change
[1:52:22] closing here.
[1:52:24] Give me a few minutes.
[1:52:27] Hold your belly.
[1:52:33] The devil will flee if you say no. I
[1:52:36] don't want that. He will come and he
[1:52:39] will run away. But he's not going to run
[1:52:42] away forever. He will come back again.
[1:52:45] He will try another way. The devil
[1:52:48] sometimes he he will he will try to use
[1:52:51] our kids against us.
[1:52:53] You know the prophet could identify no
[1:52:56] that my baby is crying all all the time.
[1:52:58] Now it's the devil Rebecca. Now that's
[1:53:00] the devil. You recognize it. You have to
[1:53:02] rebuke it. Times can be the parents
[1:53:05] against the children. times can be your
[1:53:07] wife against the husband or the vice
[1:53:09] versa. So you try different ways right
[1:53:12] the wrong time and oh you you overreact
[1:53:15] and I uses that. So we we need to know
[1:53:18] how we knew to identify as a believer.
[1:53:21] You need to discern all that. That's the
[1:53:23] enemy. I don't want to I don't want to
[1:53:25] give into that. You you create the
[1:53:27] atmosphere. You you have to work on that
[1:53:29] to resist him. It's a fight. But you
[1:53:30] have to resist. You have to create the
[1:53:32] right atmosphere. Is the right
[1:53:34] comparison I could think of is to the
[1:53:36] devil is a mosquito. A devil is like a
[1:53:39] mosquito.
[1:53:41] We're going to go in summer now.
[1:53:42] Mosquito going to come.
[1:53:45] you you reject him, he will go but he
[1:53:48] comes again
[1:53:50] like he he's so stubborn. He does. He's
[1:53:52] just want some of them at the end you
[1:53:54] you kill him, right? That the devil, you
[1:53:57] will go and come back again. You go and
[1:53:58] come back. It's time to be completely
[1:54:00] destroyed is coming. But as is there,
[1:54:03] you need to cast him away. He comes this
[1:54:06] way, you cast him away. You come away,
[1:54:07] you cast him away. You come this way,
[1:54:08] cast him away. You know in Africa where
[1:54:11] mosquito they have malaria. Here they
[1:54:14] here they don't have malaria. Thank God.
[1:54:17] But I grew up in Africa part of my life.
[1:54:20] Mosquito malaria. Oh, and they bite you.
[1:54:22] Oh, when you get malaria, it gets
[1:54:25] you so sick. It's it's it's like a cold
[1:54:27] and flu and everything mixed. So very
[1:54:31] bad thing. But you know how what we used
[1:54:34] to do sometime outside and then you
[1:54:36] there so a lot many of them mosquito and
[1:54:38] you try to fight them. You fight them.
[1:54:40] What do you have to do? You have to run
[1:54:41] in the house. Amen. You have to be
[1:54:44] sealed in the house. Then they are
[1:54:46] outside. They can't fight you. You're
[1:54:48] outside. You need to be sealed. The same
[1:54:50] thing as a Christian as I started at the
[1:54:52] beginning. Sometimes you have to run
[1:54:54] from them and be sealed in Christ. You
[1:54:58] have to be sealed in Christ. You cannot
[1:55:00] overcome without the Holy Ghost. You
[1:55:03] have to be sealed in Christ because if
[1:55:06] you go outside of Christ, that's where
[1:55:08] you have troubles. Amen. Be behind
[1:55:11] Christ. Be behind the token. Amen. If
[1:55:14] the devil comes, you have to show him
[1:55:16] the token. when he comes to fight
[1:55:18] against you, show him the token. Show
[1:55:21] him that you are a son of God. I'm
[1:55:23] standing on God's promises. I reject
[1:55:26] what the enemy is trying to put upon me.
[1:55:28] Amen.
[1:55:30] But sometimes as a example of a
[1:55:32] mosquito,
[1:55:34] sometimes they stepped in in the mind,
[1:55:36] right? They come and they in the house
[1:55:39] and oh,
[1:55:42] one step and it still catches you. But
[1:55:44] not all mosquitoes bite will make you
[1:55:47] sick. No, not all of them will make you
[1:55:49] sick. You can reason and makes you sick.
[1:55:52] There is something that is greater. And
[1:55:54] I want to leave you with that thought.
[1:55:56] As the prophet says,
[1:55:58] another thing that we take food for is
[1:56:01] to build up our body to resist diseases.
[1:56:05] If you don't take food and let your body
[1:56:07] get weak, then it's subject to diseases.
[1:56:11] diseases will break right into the
[1:56:13] bloodstream and here you're gone. And if
[1:56:15] your blood isn't rich and pure well then
[1:56:18] it will dis it will disease will go
[1:56:21] right into your bloodstream. So you've
[1:56:23] got to eat good nourishing food to keep
[1:56:27] your bloodstream right. If you don't
[1:56:30] you're allergic to diseases. That's what
[1:56:32] the matter with a lot of Christians.
[1:56:36] That's the problem with a lot of
[1:56:38] Christians. He's been there. is a
[1:56:40] Christian. He gave his life to Christ.
[1:56:42] But all the time he's sick. All the time
[1:56:44] he's sick. All the time he's sick. But
[1:56:46] you are born again. Oh, even sometimes
[1:56:48] born again Christians, but all time sick
[1:56:51] spiritually. All time seeks. Why?
[1:56:53] Because they don't feed upon the word of
[1:56:56] God.
[1:56:58] Amen.
[1:56:59] The Holy Spirit feeds upon the word of
[1:57:02] God. We have to feed upon the word of
[1:57:04] God. You can't just rely sometimes on
[1:57:07] one service on a Sunday. You become weak
[1:57:11] and full of diseases. You'll end up
[1:57:14] being you see something catches on you.
[1:57:16] You you are very quick to temper. You
[1:57:18] are very quick to gossiping. You are
[1:57:19] very quick to different things. Very
[1:57:21] quick to last. Why? Because you are
[1:57:24] weak. The blood stream is weak. Even
[1:57:26] though you are Christian, but you are
[1:57:27] weak. But God has given up a seven fe a
[1:57:31] seven seven course menu meal. Amen. the
[1:57:35] word of God, the spiritual food in due
[1:57:38] season, feed upon it daily. Amen. A
[1:57:42] Christian feeds on the word of God
[1:57:45] daily. Amen.
[1:57:47] Quick example to put if I if you eat
[1:57:50] now, now the belly is already starting,
[1:57:53] right?
[1:57:54] Natural
[1:57:56] natural need. Something is telling you,
[1:57:58] okay, you need to eat God. Thank God for
[1:58:01] that because if you don't have it,
[1:58:02] you'll starve.
[1:58:04] I don't feel I don't feel hunger. Oh, I
[1:58:06] don't feel hunger. You'll die. Even
[1:58:08] though you don't feel that hunger,
[1:58:10] you'll die. But when you have that
[1:58:11] hunger, it's God's signal that you put
[1:58:15] inside of your body say no, you have to
[1:58:17] feed otherwise you'll die. The same
[1:58:19] thing for spiritually say no, you can
[1:58:21] think, oh, I don't feel like the needs
[1:58:22] to eat. I'm okay. No, you're not okay.
[1:58:25] You need to come back to the word of
[1:58:27] God. Let let that let that that that
[1:58:30] thirst or hunger be there. If you don't
[1:58:33] have there, so God, give me that hunger
[1:58:35] to feed upon the word of God. If I don't
[1:58:37] have it, I'm becoming weak without
[1:58:39] knowing that I'm weak. And that's why
[1:58:40] I'm bound to diseases. I'm bound to
[1:58:42] this. I'm bound to criticism. I bound to
[1:58:44] all sometimes you can even quot the word
[1:58:46] of God. But you have a critical spirit.
[1:58:49] Why all those things? Because you are
[1:58:51] not feeding upon the word. I don't want
[1:58:52] to end up in this negative tone, but I
[1:58:55] just put it and don't listen to
[1:58:56] encouragement to each each and every one
[1:58:58] of us. Lord, I want to feed upon the
[1:59:01] word of God because that's what will
[1:59:03] give me power to resist the devil. So
[1:59:07] God from here the diseases and different
[1:59:09] things, spiritual diseases, the word of
[1:59:11] God has the vitamins to fight against
[1:59:14] it. God has given us the appropriate
[1:59:16] word of God to be able to fight those
[1:59:19] diseases.
[1:59:21] End time message meet end time
[1:59:23] conditions. In this end time conditions
[1:59:25] we are living in that many evil spirit
[1:59:27] but God has provided the word of God to
[1:59:31] fight those diseases. Amen. We are an
[1:59:33] overcomer. Amen. There's no perfect love
[1:59:36] in the world. You can never find perfect
[1:59:38] love in the world. Even in the religious
[1:59:41] world, perfect love can only be found in
[1:59:43] a message. What is producing that? The
[1:59:46] food we are feeding on. The Holy Spirit
[1:59:49] that is feeding upon the word of God
[1:59:51] will produce perfect love. Amen. Amen.
[1:59:54] Cannot go on the other side without that
[1:59:56] perfect love. How is it going to come?
[1:59:58] Feed upon the word of God. The Holy
[2:00:00] Spirit will produce that. Amen.
[2:00:06] Prophet says we are not feeding on a
[2:00:08] man. A man his word will fail. But you
[2:00:10] are feeding on the unfailing body word
[2:00:13] of the son of man. If you haven't fed
[2:00:15] fully on every word to give yourself
[2:00:18] strength to fly above all these
[2:00:20] denominations and things of the world,
[2:00:23] you're struggling to fight the things of
[2:00:24] the world. You know, come and feed upon
[2:00:27] the word of God. Create the atmosphere.
[2:00:30] Amen. The mosquito don't like the spray.
[2:00:34] Why? Because it create an atmosphere
[2:00:36] that they can't resist
[2:00:39] or they can't stand. The same thing for
[2:00:41] a Christian. Stay in prayer. It will
[2:00:43] create that atmosphere. It will sweeten
[2:00:46] your temper. Amen. What is making that?
[2:00:48] You create atmosphere to prayer to the
[2:00:51] things you read. Amen. It will fight the
[2:00:53] enemy. The body will fight for you.
[2:00:56] Sometimes you you don't even to come and
[2:00:58] fight yourself and fight yourself as as
[2:01:01] Peter wanted you to fight. You know, he
[2:01:02] wanted you to fight as they came to to
[2:01:04] take Jesus Christ. So, I'm going to show
[2:01:06] them how I can fight with my sword.
[2:01:10] Jesus says, "No, leave that sword. If
[2:01:12] you kill with a sword, you'll die with
[2:01:14] that sword. It's not that sword I'm
[2:01:15] talking about. You need to take the
[2:01:17] sword of the word of God. And told
[2:01:19] Peter, when I ask you to pray, because
[2:01:23] temptation was coming. This is what I
[2:01:25] was talking about in the time of
[2:01:27] temptation. Before it comes, you need to
[2:01:30] pray. Why people are falling when
[2:01:32] temptation comes? Because sometimes
[2:01:34] maybe they don't pray enough. May God
[2:01:36] give us the desire to pray because we
[2:01:39] are resisting against the enemy. How can
[2:01:41] I be a strong believer? Pray and read
[2:01:45] the Bible every day. Simple quote.
[2:01:48] Simple quote. But we are fighting in the
[2:01:51] flesh. But God may God give us grace.
[2:01:53] Amen.
[2:01:58] I'll finish with this quote of this. We
[2:02:02] are we are fighting against the enemy
[2:02:05] and we are in the business of chopping
[2:02:08] the enemy and fighting against the
[2:02:10] enemy. what is give upon you, you reject
[2:02:12] what the enemy is giving. The prophet
[2:02:15] says, could you imagine the United
[2:02:16] States Army training a man to sit around
[2:02:19] and eat cookies and so forth? Why? He
[2:02:23] gives him a uniform and his gun and
[2:02:25] trains him to get out there and fight
[2:02:27] and defend the nation. That's what we've
[2:02:29] got to do. We've got to defend our
[2:02:31] Godgiven
[2:02:33] right. What God says, it's ours. Let's
[2:02:36] stand right toeto toe with Satan. Amen.
[2:02:40] Everything that is God is defeated. The
[2:02:43] only thing is a scarecrow that all he
[2:02:45] cannot bother you. A man that's born of
[2:02:48] the spirit of God. There is nothing at
[2:02:50] all can harm him. Now Satan can push
[2:02:52] things all over you and just keep
[2:02:55] shoving out shoving you out and shoving
[2:02:57] you out. Amen. Says if you went to my
[2:03:00] house tomorrow night and looked out and
[2:03:01] they moved into my house, it was a big
[2:03:04] bunch of people and they were drunk and
[2:03:06] prostitute and carry on. output them and
[2:03:08] how how are you going to do? You'll say
[2:03:10] I'm a human. This house is made for
[2:03:12] human. I can live here too. This belongs
[2:03:15] to me. Amen. Are you following me? This
[2:03:17] is my legal possession. I've got an
[2:03:20] abstract deed here at a courthouse that
[2:03:23] shows this belongs to me and you cannot
[2:03:26] stay here any longer.
[2:03:29] Observe notice on them and they'll have
[2:03:31] to move. If they didn't, there is a law
[2:03:33] down there that will make them move. The
[2:03:36] Holy Ghost is here to enforce the word
[2:03:38] of God and make that move. Satan, this
[2:03:41] is not your legal possession. Get out.
[2:03:45] I'll call my son. Is he sleeping?
[2:03:49] Paul, come.
[2:03:52] Brother Victor, come if you don't mind.
[2:04:03] I'm going to call the Victor.
[2:04:05] Satan. I hope it's okay. That's okay. I
[2:04:09] hope it's okay. My son
[2:04:13] is a son of God. Sometimes in our mind
[2:04:16] that how things present. We are so small
[2:04:19] but the devil is so big or he pretend to
[2:04:22] be big. It's actually a dream that
[2:04:24] someone had. Brother Bam talks about
[2:04:27] that dream. Says there was someone was
[2:04:29] there. The devil was coming to come to
[2:04:31] that little that that that brother and
[2:04:33] every time he will say woo woo and the
[2:04:36] brother will come will feel so small and
[2:04:39] the devil will look so big so big so big
[2:04:41] every time you say woo so big so big and
[2:04:44] if he if he doesn't quote the word of
[2:04:46] God he become so small so small but the
[2:04:49] prophet says as the brother was having
[2:04:51] that dreams he didn't have any weapon
[2:04:53] and he look around he found the Bible of
[2:04:55] God the Bible that the only thing he
[2:04:57] will take so every time the devil says
[2:05:00] boo, he takes the word of God, he says,
[2:05:04] say boo back to him. Boo. Say boo. He
[2:05:08] say back. Say boo. Boo. Say I'm healed.
[2:05:11] I'm healed. I'm saved. I'm saved. Jesus
[2:05:13] Christ is my redeemer. Jesus Christ is
[2:05:15] my redeemer. My family is saved. My
[2:05:18] family is As he's quoting the word of
[2:05:20] God is becoming bigger and the devil is
[2:05:22] becoming smaller.
[2:05:25] Thank you, brother. Bless.
[2:05:27] [Applause]
[2:05:32] That's how we have to be. We have to
[2:05:33] stand toe-to-toe with the devil. And
[2:05:35] even though it might be a big symptom,
[2:05:38] something abnormal, you call the word of
[2:05:40] God, you say, "Boo devil. I'm standing
[2:05:43] on the word of God. And I'm going to be
[2:05:46] a normal an overcomer more than an
[2:05:49] overcomer because Jesus Christ already
[2:05:51] paid the price for me." Amen. May God
[2:05:53] bless you. Amen.
[2:05:56] Amen.
[2:06:06] Brother Andrew, I'll need you.
[2:06:14] In the name of Jesus, we have the
[2:06:15] victory.

[2:06:31] Jesus. We have the victory victory.

[2:06:55] me who can stand before us. In the
[2:07:01] precious name of Jesus, we have the
[2:07:06] victory.

[2:07:35] of Jesus, tell me who can stand before
[2:07:42] us in the precious
[2:07:46] name of Jesus. We have the victory. When
[2:07:51] we come in the name of Jesus,
[2:07:54] when we come in the name of Jesus, tell
[2:08:00] me who can stand before us in the
[2:08:06] precious
[2:08:08] name of Jesus. We have the victory.
[2:08:14] How many believe that?
[2:08:17] Glory to God. Glory to God. The name of
[2:08:20] Jesus is above any other name. Amen.
[2:08:24] There is power, power, power in the name
[2:08:26] of Jesus.
[2:08:28] [Music]
[2:08:36] Oo. Be free from your burden of sin. Oh,

[2:09:03] power in the blood
[2:09:07] of the lamb.
