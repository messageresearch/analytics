[51:22] before the capstone
[51:26] is the brotherly love and brotherly
[51:28] kindness.
[51:30] Just want to read that on first Peter
[51:32] chap 2 second Peter chapter 1
[51:42] second Peter chapter 1 verse 7 to save
[51:46] time and to godliness second Peter
[51:49] chapter
[51:52] it's towards the end
[51:55] as I hear your Bible turning it's a good
[51:57] sign
[51:59] I like I I I like the real Bible. The
[52:01] physical Bible not always sometime we
[52:04] have on the phone sometime helps but
[52:06] also like the the physical Bible and uh
[52:09] one time one brother said you know what
[52:11] if you are in the train or the public
[52:13] bus or anything if you're just reading
[52:16] your Bible on the on the phone no one
[52:18] knows what you are doing but when you
[52:20] take the real Bible
[52:21] &gt;&gt; then people say oh that's that's the
[52:23] real thing.
[52:25] One time I was going to just came to my
[52:27] mind. I was I was going to London and I
[52:30] I missed my plane because I wanted to
[52:32] see my wife, you know, when you're in
[52:34] love just so I forgot about the plane.
[52:37] So, no, I can miss it. And then and I
[52:40] missed it and I went back to get another
[52:42] one. Say, "Okay, sir, you missed it." I
[52:44] said, "I know I missed it." And so,
[52:46] okay. So, what
[52:49] how much I pay? I was willing to pay
[52:50] anything, you know, in love.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[52:54] &gt;&gt; paid anything. I can pay anything
[52:56] whatever price it is. And I said,
[52:57] "Okay." And the person was I had my
[52:59] Bible in my hand like this. And the
[53:02] person was so sir um what do you I see
[53:05] you're holding a a holy book. Say yes
[53:08] sir. So because because you are holding
[53:12] that holy book, not going to pay
[53:14] anything. Just promise me that you are
[53:16] going to read it. Said yes, I'll read
[53:19] it.
[53:21] And I took my flight back.
[53:24] Thank God. Amen.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Second Peter chapter one. Chapter one.
[53:28] Yeah. Verse 7. And to godliness,
[53:31] brotherly kindness, and to brotherly
[53:33] kindness, charity.
[53:36] And if these things be in you, not only
[53:39] be in you, but if they also abound, they
[53:42] make you that you shall neither be
[53:44] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[53:47] of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; But he that lackth these things is blind
[53:52] and cannot see a far off and have
[53:55] forgotten that he was purged from his
[53:57] old sins. Wherefore the rather brethren
[54:01] give diligence, give diligence to make
[54:05] your calling and election sure. So give
[54:08] diligence, make an effort that that you
[54:12] make your calling and election sure,
[54:15] real. Because if you do these things,
[54:18] not only if you believe these things,
[54:19] but if you do these things,
[54:22] then you shall never fall.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. May God bless his word and the
[54:29] reading of it and give us the context of
[54:32] the word this morning.
[54:37] Personally,
[54:42] it has been a long trip for
[54:45] for for this study and thank you for
[54:47] bearing with me and on this long study
[54:51] as Pastor Zigg told one time you you
[54:54] have plenty of time. You don't have to
[54:56] rush. Just take your time and thank you
[54:59] for just we just took our time almost
[55:01] almost one year on this topic.
[55:05] I believe it has been a blessing to you.
[55:07] Personally, it has been a blessing to me
[55:10] just to revisit those things and to have
[55:13] a balance in the things and just
[55:16] strengthen my faith and my walk with God
[55:19] and my desire for that to become
[55:21] reality. Not just to be in the book, not
[55:24] just to be in the message, not just to
[55:26] be put there. No, but I I want it to be
[55:30] reflected in my life. I want that to be
[55:32] a reality in my life. The prophet said
[55:36] one one place he says the
[55:38] Philadelphiaian church age was the
[55:39] Methodist church age the church age of
[55:42] brotherly life the reformation says when
[55:44] rank Calvinist has sprang up in the
[55:47] Anglican church in England where they
[55:50] didn't have a revival no more went
[55:53] planned off into haste god God raised
[55:57] John Wesley as a legalist to take the
[56:00] Armenian doctrine
[56:02] sometimes it's good to have the balance
[56:04] on the sometimes we just things but I
[56:07] want I like when it becomes practical
[56:10] that's what brings sometimes a revival
[56:12] amen
[56:17] so we are going to talk about brotherly
[56:19] kindness for a few months prophet
[56:21] himself didn't take too much time as in
[56:23] the message of the statue of a perfect
[56:25] man and myself I was wondering why uh uh
[56:30] it's why why talk about brotherly
[56:32] kindness why speak about Bradley Khan.
[56:34] It seems like a tiny thing and but but
[56:37] strange enough it it is the virtue for
[56:40] our age is the virtue for the Laudisian
[56:43] age and brother Banam is the messenger
[56:45] of Laudian age. Amen. And says but
[56:48] strange enough that that that's where we
[56:50] should be that where we should that what
[56:53] should be uh that was the emphasis and I
[56:55] was I was personally I was thinking
[56:57] about it why is it so important? Why
[57:00] brotherly kindness so important in our
[57:02] age? I see why why the prophet had to
[57:06] emphasize in in other messages what is
[57:09] in relation to it. I I I'll confess
[57:11] maybe with you that maybe tomorrow it
[57:13] became more real to me and oh I see why
[57:16] I see why I see why it's important.
[57:19] Amen. So we just want to go lead into
[57:22] that this morning. And so why do we need
[57:25] filio? The question that I'm just trying
[57:27] to answer myself is why do we need fil
[57:30] love when we are just about to get agapa
[57:34] love? Why do we need your love when
[57:37] agapa love is the most important one?
[57:40] Why do we still need fil love? The
[57:43] prophet says from for that but let me
[57:46] tell you a little secret. The most
[57:47] powerful force in the world isn't
[57:49] speaking in with tongues or interpreting
[57:52] tongues or being honored by God to be a
[57:54] minister or to be an evangelist or to be
[57:57] a prophet. The most powerful weapon that
[58:00] I've ever found in my life is love.
[58:03] Amen.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; It says the says that's the most
[58:06] powerful weapon is love. Amen. that says
[58:10] the fio love the fo love which the Greek
[58:12] word comes from friendship like you have
[58:16] for your wife there is a difference it
[58:18] will make a mother for that for that
[58:20] baby run through a blazing fly fire fire
[58:23] or life means nothing that fill your
[58:26] love but what will aapo do says the
[58:29] godly love we must love divinely love
[58:33] one another then you don't see your
[58:34] brother brother's mistake anymore says
[58:38] if he does make a mistake take you never
[58:40] you look over the top of it you love him
[58:42] anyhow say that is love those who that
[58:46] love you that doesn't then does not does
[58:50] not the sinner it says love those that
[58:53] love you then does not the sinner do the
[58:56] same thing but love those who doesn't
[58:59] love you that's what shows the spirit of
[59:01] God is new amen because he loved you
[59:05] when you were his enemy and he loved you
[59:08] and if That spirit is in you, it will
[59:10] make you love your enemy as you do your
[59:13] friend. So divine love makes you makes
[59:16] you for forgive your brother and see
[59:19] behind his m beyond his mistakes. It
[59:22] makes even you pray for your enemies. It
[59:24] makes you love them. Makes you uh focus
[59:28] on the eternal life. Amen. So that's the
[59:30] most important thing. I don't want to to
[59:32] to to belittle that. That the most
[59:35] important thing is a power love. Amen.
[59:37] And that's what we desire to go and
[59:39] that's what we desire to go and that
[59:41] what we desire in our life. And another
[59:42] place you will say many times the church
[59:46] gets that mixed up and they're trying to
[59:48] apply feel love which means friendship
[59:51] to be like agapa love but there is a
[59:53] difference. If you love your wife as you
[59:55] should and some men would insult your
[59:57] wife you would kill him because you
[59:59] would be jealous of her. That's what fio
[1:00:02] love would lead to. But agapa love will
[1:00:05] make you pray for his lost soul. That's
[1:00:08] the difference. So the attitude of
[1:00:10] expression is different. The feel of
[1:00:12] love will maybe just go and because of
[1:00:14] jealousy because of because you and and
[1:00:18] and actually you should be jealous. I
[1:00:20] mean it's not like you you just whatever
[1:00:23] it does to your wife and you just ignore
[1:00:25] it. No, you you should be you should be
[1:00:27] jealous. Something should happen in your
[1:00:28] heart. You should not become
[1:00:30] indifferent. Uh I remember one time I
[1:00:32] preached and says um brother Bham says
[1:00:34] that but don't don't don't try to insult
[1:00:37] my wife. [laughter]
[1:00:38] You will be in trouble. You might see
[1:00:40] the other face of myself. So that's
[1:00:43] still true and but the reaction how you
[1:00:46] react and I pray that my reaction
[1:00:49] doesn't just not become connal becomes
[1:00:51] is measured and it comes with love. You
[1:00:54] look at the consequences you help the
[1:00:56] other person to understand. Amen. So the
[1:00:59] the so it's there but and it should be
[1:01:02] there brother I'm say you should love
[1:01:03] your life you should have the feel of
[1:01:05] love but should have the feel of love
[1:01:07] but the reaction it need to be under the
[1:01:10] power of the agapa love amen
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; so let's first of all let's give them
[1:01:17] let's give the definition of that
[1:01:18] brother has already defined it but the
[1:01:21] Greek word for the brotherly love says
[1:01:24] is Philadelphia is brotherly kindness
[1:01:28] which literally love for for brothers,
[1:01:30] love for for sisters. The brother love
[1:01:33] comes naturally when there is a
[1:01:35] connection often easier to show to
[1:01:38] people you like or you know it involves
[1:01:41] feelings of closeness and mutual care.
[1:01:44] That's so so so real and so important. I
[1:01:47] mean I I love you all. I love all the
[1:01:50] sisters and and brother says all the
[1:01:52] wonderful sisters I have here and the
[1:01:54] beautiful and good character and
[1:01:56] everything and and I love you all and I
[1:01:59] want everybody to be saved and
[1:02:01] everything but there's still only one
[1:02:04] that's called my wife. So there is still
[1:02:07] one that called my wife. She goes with
[1:02:08] me and there is a is a portion of love
[1:02:12] that is there that is different from the
[1:02:14] other sisters that and that that's the
[1:02:16] filio love and it has to be there. Amen.
[1:02:19] Praise be to God. It has to be there.
[1:02:21] And if you see that, so there is a
[1:02:23] character of a spiritual love, but there
[1:02:25] is also a a natural love. It looks like
[1:02:28] a natural life, which is a filio love
[1:02:31] that also needs to be there in the
[1:02:34] believers among the believers. So the
[1:02:37] love for your brothers, the love for
[1:02:38] your sister has to be there. Every man,
[1:02:41] if you go outside here, let me tell you,
[1:02:43] if you go outside here, you love any
[1:02:45] sinners that pass. You should love any
[1:02:47] sinner because you have a gap love. You
[1:02:49] should love it. But let me tell you
[1:02:51] there is also a different love from
[1:02:54] those who are here in the church.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; You should it should be the the what
[1:02:58] makes you love those in the church more
[1:03:00] because there is a closeness. There is a
[1:03:03] connection. There is a relationship.
[1:03:06] There is there is a mutual contact.
[1:03:08] There is there is something that MAKES
[1:03:10] YOU CLOSER THAN OTHERS. AMEN.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; THERE IT HAS to be there. You can't just
[1:03:15] say no I love you with a gapa love. Yes
[1:03:18] we should love everybody with a gapa
[1:03:20] love but there is something that should
[1:03:22] be put people a little bit closer when
[1:03:25] and you need that affection. You need
[1:03:28] that brotherly kindness. And brother
[1:03:30] Vanam was so
[1:03:32] we might go to brother Vanam was so so
[1:03:35] so against denominations.
[1:03:38] Even though everybody was Christians,
[1:03:40] they didn't have that closeness. They
[1:03:42] couldn't fellowship with one another.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Even though they were just saying, "No,
[1:03:46] we love one another." But they couldn't
[1:03:47] fellowship one another. And Ban says,
[1:03:49] "No, I hate denominations because it
[1:03:52] bringing barriers. It brings
[1:03:54] separations. It doesn't bring people
[1:03:56] closer." Amen. I want PEOPLE TO BE
[1:03:58] CLOSE. I want people to have
[1:04:00] connections. I WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE
[1:04:02] INTERACTIONS. IT'S PART OF THE STATURE
[1:04:05] OF A PERFECT MAN. YOU CAN'T JUST IGNORE
[1:04:07] IT. YOU CAN'T JUST SAY, "NO, I HAVE
[1:04:08] AGAPA LOVE." YES. BUT YOU NEED THAT
[1:04:11] closeness as well too.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Now agapa love comes now from the agape
[1:04:20] and it's translated in the King James
[1:04:22] version is a charity. It's
[1:04:24] self-sacrificing. It's unconditional.
[1:04:27] So you can say it's like a power. It's
[1:04:29] unconditional. Whether you are sinner,
[1:04:30] whether you are brothers, whether you
[1:04:32] have to love them. God has put that you
[1:04:35] have to love them. But let me tell you
[1:04:39] the example of the brothers. If someone
[1:04:42] hurt your wife or hurt your children and
[1:04:45] you forgive them with a power love, but
[1:04:48] let me next time you will be a little
[1:04:50] bit more careful to leave your children
[1:04:52] next to that person.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:55] If you don't, there is a problem.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; That's my opinion. There is a problem.
[1:05:02] You'll be a little bit more careful.
[1:05:03] Okay, I love you. I want to be saved and
[1:05:06] everything, but you know, let me be
[1:05:08] careful. Let me watch your attitude. Let
[1:05:09] me see how you change. Let me see your
[1:05:11] character. Let me see how things are.
[1:05:13] And it has to be there.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; The same thing as well for the church.
[1:05:17] So, so there there is there is a portion
[1:05:20] of a life that has to be manifested that
[1:05:24] above that that that that unconditional
[1:05:26] love there is something that you have to
[1:05:29] entertain to make sure that the affilio
[1:05:32] love is maintained as well and that part
[1:05:36] is is is it comes I believe it comes by
[1:05:39] interaction by closeness by
[1:05:42] communication by connection that's
[1:05:44] that's what the the definition of a
[1:05:46] brotherly love for your brothers and
[1:05:48] sisters. Like in your family, WE YOU ALL
[1:05:50] LOVE EVERYBODY, but the love for YOUR
[1:05:53] BROTHER IN MY family is still a little
[1:05:55] bit different. I'm sorry to confess
[1:05:58] that, but it's still different. And I'm
[1:05:59] sure it's the same for you. He's a
[1:06:01] believer. Especially when he's a
[1:06:03] believer and he's in the family, there's
[1:06:05] just something he can call me at any
[1:06:07] time and then why they just he's my
[1:06:10] brother.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; But if is so disconnected and no
[1:06:18] connection then it becomes like okay
[1:06:21] then uh okay [clears throat]
[1:06:25] amen.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; So in simple terms brother love is I
[1:06:30] love you because you are my brother and
[1:06:32] my sister and agap love I love you
[1:06:36] because God loves you. Because God
[1:06:39] doesn't love the sin but he loves the
[1:06:41] sinner. So you love unconditionally. So
[1:06:45] important agapa love is a greater love
[1:06:47] and is a more mature love. But we still
[1:06:50] need to make sure that we have the feel
[1:06:53] your love. Amen. Why in the stretch of a
[1:06:55] perfect is to have one than the other
[1:06:58] after the other. You can look it for
[1:06:59] yourself. And as I said for that said in
[1:07:02] first John 4:20 says if a man says I
[1:07:05] love God and hateth of his brother is a
[1:07:08] liar. For he that loveth not his brother
[1:07:10] from whom he had seen, how can he love
[1:07:12] God whom he had not seen?
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; So you need to love your brother. You
[1:07:17] need to love your sister. And that of
[1:07:19] the way you are loving your brother, the
[1:07:21] way you are loving your sister shows
[1:07:23] that you are loving God.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY CAN SAY I LOVE GOD. But if you
[1:07:27] don't love your brother, don't love your
[1:07:28] sister. WE START DOUBTING YOUR LOVE.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; WE START QUESTIONING YOUR LOVE. ACTUALLY
[1:07:33] YOURSELF SHOULD BE QUESTIONING. Not even
[1:07:35] others. Yourself should be questioning
[1:07:36] that love. Am I really loving God the
[1:07:39] way I say I love God? If I don't love my
[1:07:41] brother, if I don't love my sister, GOD,
[1:07:43] HELP ME. CHANGE YOUR CHANGE all those
[1:07:46] feelings. Remove the bitterness. Maybe
[1:07:48] there is a spirit of unforgiveness that
[1:07:50] is there. Lord, remove it. Help me to
[1:07:52] love my brother. Help me to love my
[1:07:54] sister.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Prophet will now I'll just go to what
[1:07:57] the prophet said. The prophet says in
[1:07:58] the in in the message here, I just read
[1:08:01] this. It
[1:08:05] says let's add the Bible says just a few
[1:08:08] few quotes from from brotherly love.
[1:08:09] Adding brotherly love. Brotherly
[1:08:11] kindness. Now that's a good one right
[1:08:13] here. The six seven. All right. Adding
[1:08:15] brotherly kindness. When we get to that
[1:08:18] brotherly kindness, it put yourself put
[1:08:21] yourself in his place on the matter. So
[1:08:24] if you have a brother, if you have your
[1:08:25] sister, you put yourself in the place on
[1:08:28] any matter that the brother who the
[1:08:30] sister is going through.
[1:08:32] My brother sinned against me, said
[1:08:34] Peter. Shall I forgive him? He said
[1:08:36] seven times a day. He said 70 times
[1:08:40] seven. See brotherly kindness. Now you
[1:08:43] see if a brother is all out of tune,
[1:08:47] don't be impatient with him. No, no, no.
[1:08:49] Be kind to him. Go hang out. says
[1:08:53] somebody said not letting go said how
[1:08:55] can you believe these things the way you
[1:08:57] do and still go to the assemblies of God
[1:08:59] and to oneness and all rest of them you
[1:09:01] see putsy brotherly kindness hoping
[1:09:04] someday see patient within see temperant
[1:09:07] enduring with him knowledge to
[1:09:09] understand what he believes remember it
[1:09:12] it is in his heart that what is virtue
[1:09:14] in yourself is to let it go out with
[1:09:17] kindness and meekness to him having
[1:09:20] faith that someday God will bring him
[1:09:23] in. So for me the definition of body
[1:09:26] love is when you can put yourself in the
[1:09:29] place of the other. You can have
[1:09:31] compassion for the other for the other
[1:09:33] one. You feel affection for the other
[1:09:35] one. You feel compassion for the other
[1:09:37] one. You can stand in the step of the
[1:09:39] other person. Amen. Amen.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; And I believe for me
[1:09:46] brotherly kindness or brotherly love is
[1:09:48] the same and a gap love is the same
[1:09:50] relationship as faith and works. If agap
[1:09:54] love is present towards God, it must
[1:09:57] show itself in how you treat others.
[1:10:00] Amen.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; If you really love, you have the agapo
[1:10:03] love, it has to be expressed on how you
[1:10:06] treat others. You can't say you have a
[1:10:08] gap love and if you don't still express
[1:10:12] the love in the affection way there is a
[1:10:15] problem. You can't say I love God if you
[1:10:17] don't love your brother first. Imagine
[1:10:20] if you say to your wife that just to
[1:10:22] those are married. If if that my wife I
[1:10:26] love you, I love you with a gap love
[1:10:30] but no expression of love.
[1:10:33] No sweetness,
[1:10:35] no taking care.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; No buying some some something. Woman
[1:10:40] needs some buying.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; No buying something.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; I would say she start doubting your gap.
[1:10:47] Even though I'm sure you are lover with
[1:10:50] a gap love because you want her to be
[1:10:52] saved but if you don't express it in
[1:10:54] certain ways there is a certain problem
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; prophet says you need to express your
[1:10:59] love towards your wife
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; towards your children you need to
[1:11:04] express it. Amen. Amen.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; So how can you have faith in your wife
[1:11:08] if you don't love her that in filio the
[1:11:11] prophet says how about in a gapo to God
[1:11:14] how can it be if you don't love God if
[1:11:17] you said you love your wife and never
[1:11:19] tell her about it
[1:11:22] brothers
[1:11:24] it's important to tell your wife you
[1:11:26] love her
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; don't just remind her you know that 10
[1:11:30] years ago when we were married I
[1:11:31] promised you that I loved you no that's
[1:11:34] not
[1:11:36] It's good to repeat to your wife, I love
[1:11:39] you, honey.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; You are so beautiful.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; I still love you. The older I'm getting,
[1:11:45] I don't see things, BUT THANK GOD I
[1:11:48] DON'T SEE THAT. I STILL [screaming] LOVE
[1:11:51] YOU.
[1:11:54] You need to make the love refreshed
[1:11:57] and and and and good and nice. DON'T
[1:12:01] LEAVE THE HONEYMOON only for 10 and 20
[1:12:04] years and 40 years. Make it fresh every
[1:12:07] year. Renew it. Make her make her your
[1:12:10] queen. Oh my
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; your wife is the best gift that God has
[1:12:24] given you
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; after salvation. So you take care of
[1:12:28] her. She's she's God's God's daughter.
[1:12:32] She she's a she's a princess in God's
[1:12:34] eyes. So you take care of her. You you
[1:12:36] you make sure that she she's she's
[1:12:39] brother.
[1:12:41] She's she's flourishing. Where's brother
[1:12:43] go? She
[1:12:47] she she she she's enjoying her marriage.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Just put in natural. You take you take
[1:12:53] someone's daughter to make her
[1:12:56] miserable. Oh,
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; it just doesn't make sense. Yeah,
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; someone who grew up with her father and
[1:13:03] siblings and she was happy and you one
[1:13:06] day you present yourself there and you
[1:13:08] know on the first few days you are very
[1:13:10] nice and everything and then once she
[1:13:12] comes your house you start mistreating
[1:13:14] her and that that just human not even a
[1:13:17] Christian that not even a Christian just
[1:13:20] a naturally it doesn't make sense
[1:13:23] you you need to love her she she she's a
[1:13:26] human being she's not an object she's
[1:13:29] She's not just for you as an object. No,
[1:13:32] she's a person, a full person like you.
[1:13:35] So you treat her, you take care of her,
[1:13:37] you make sure that she she's happy where
[1:13:39] she is.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; If our wives are happy at home, we will
[1:13:50] have some in the church.
[1:13:55] SOMETIME WE DON'T HAVE IT BECAUSE THE
[1:13:57] HUSBAND IS always a military man AT HOME
[1:14:01] AND YOU WANT HIM TO REJOICE IN CHURCH
[1:14:03] DOESN'T WORK
[1:14:05] BROTHER. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO
[1:14:07] WORK.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; MAY GOD HELP US. AMEN.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; She's a weak vessel. She has a
[1:14:13] temperament and emotional or all that.
[1:14:16] It's well known.
[1:14:20] I don't like TV shows and everything but
[1:14:23] I think
[1:14:25] I was at my sister whatever I don't have
[1:14:27] a television at home so but they were
[1:14:30] doing some some some jokes at some point
[1:14:32] you know switch wives
[1:14:36] you know just take for one day and see
[1:14:38] how they doing so you think that your
[1:14:40] wife is the worst you just want the
[1:14:41] other wife
[1:14:43] okay just one day just for during the
[1:14:46] day how she's cooking and then they
[1:14:48] switch the wives then just the other one
[1:14:51] is cooking then realize this one is also
[1:14:55] actually worse than my wife [laughter]
[1:14:58] she's leaving things dirty she NO NO NO
[1:15:01] GIVE BACK MY wife [laughter]
[1:15:06] Satan is sometimes playing on us right
[1:15:09] do you think that you just see THAT
[1:15:10] SISTER AT CHURCH [screaming] THAT ONE
[1:15:12] should be a beautiful sister good WIFE
[1:15:15] OH NO SHE HAS THE SAME PROBLEMS AS YOUR
[1:15:19] JUST LOVE HER, EXPRESS HER, make her
[1:15:21] feel comfortable. I always say if Christ
[1:15:25] made us and gave us the authority where
[1:15:28] we are today, we are the bride of Jesus
[1:15:30] Christ.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; And we claim that we are the final voice
[1:15:33] to the final age and all the authority
[1:15:36] has been given to us and all that we
[1:15:38] claim in the message of the hour.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; But it's Christ taking us in our
[1:15:42] weakness in the WAY WE ARE
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; UNWORTHY AND WE are preacher. If we
[1:15:47] really believe is for Christ then we
[1:15:49] should do that the SAME THING FOR OUR
[1:15:51] WIVES.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; LOVER AFFECTION LOVE BROTHER LOVE
[1:15:56] WITHOUT FILL YOUR LOVE.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T BUILD MARRIAGE ONLY WITH AGAPA
[1:16:01] LOVE.

[1:17:04] called maybe. [laughter]
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; So, it's part of it. Feel your love.
[1:17:16] It's important. Amen.
[1:17:21] If you never tell her about it and never
[1:17:23] sit down and [clears throat] and make
[1:17:25] love to her, express it to her, kiss
[1:17:28] her, hug her,
[1:17:33] hug her in during the day.
[1:17:38] Can I believe it? My my children know
[1:17:40] me. We run in the house with my wife.
[1:17:44] She doesn't like me to hug her, but I'm
[1:17:46] running. KIDS, YOU SEE, MOMMY DOESN'T
[1:17:48] LIKE TO HUG AND THEN MOMMY, HOW YOU
[1:17:50] [screaming] DON'T LIKE YOU? DADDY to hug
[1:17:53] you. Then then when I catch her, I hug
[1:17:56] her. Give her a kiss.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Women are like that. They always run.
[1:18:04] But you just run after her. It's okay.
[1:18:07] It's okay.
[1:18:09] It's okay.
[1:18:11] It's okay. Makes them appreciate. It's
[1:18:14] okay. It's fine.
[1:18:19] As a Christian, the prophet touch on
[1:18:21] those element.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; And it's important.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Can't just focus on agapa love. It's
[1:18:27] good and it's mature. One day prophet
[1:18:30] says on the other side there was no
[1:18:32] filio love anymore because there was no
[1:18:35] there's no glands anymore it was just
[1:18:37] aapar love and that's where we
[1:18:40] uncondition love and that's where we are
[1:18:42] aiming and it's important but don't
[1:18:46] neglect also
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; brotherly kindness feel your love it's
[1:18:51] part of it
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; and if you never tell her that she's the
[1:18:57] best cook in the country.
[1:19:01] Hey,
[1:19:04] when you get invited somewhere else,
[1:19:07] that's nice, sister. Hey,
[1:19:10] but in your house, never say,
[1:19:12] "Sweetheart,
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; come on now.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; What you are cooking is so nice.
[1:19:16] I enjoyed it.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you. Thank you very much."
[1:19:22] But no, just just other places. And the
[1:19:25] wife becomes jealous. She become
[1:19:27] frustrated.
[1:19:29] Then you call pastor
[1:19:31] or the deacon, paratender and it goes.
[1:19:34] No, no, no. But maybe start for the few
[1:19:37] small things there.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; So sweetheart, I love what you cook
[1:19:40] today.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, beautiful.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; I'll say sometimes even you you you make
[1:19:46] it you exaggerate it a little bit. It's
[1:19:48] okay to exaggerate.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; It's too salty. Don't say it's too
[1:19:51] salty. It's beautiful city. It's okay.
[1:19:57] It's okay.
[1:20:00] Is it okay?
[1:20:04] Oh, no. I Let's just go restaurant.
[1:20:07] Sometimes it's good to bring her to the
[1:20:08] restaurant, too. Once in a while. Not
[1:20:12] too much though. But once in a while,
[1:20:14] bring her to the restaurant. Make her
[1:20:16] the rest. Let her have a little bit. You
[1:20:18] have a sweetheart and give her a little
[1:20:20] bit of a restaurant. She enjoys that
[1:20:22] time. And so
[1:20:25] she feel loved. If you love a wife, she
[1:20:29] will produce that love more than what
[1:20:32] you expected.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; A woman is a womb.
[1:20:38] Whatever you give her, she multiplies
[1:20:40] it.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; If you give her a little bit of love,
[1:20:43] she will multiply that love more than
[1:20:46] you can expect. So it's important to
[1:20:48] love our wives
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; and our mothers.
[1:20:52] So all the things that you know and how
[1:20:53] pretty she is, how pretty she is,
[1:20:57] it's good to emphasize to your wife.
[1:20:59] Sometimes to our daughters, those that
[1:21:01] made the the girls to be loved and be
[1:21:03] appreciated. The prophet says it's
[1:21:06] important to tell, "Oh, you look pretty,
[1:21:08] you're beautiful. This is a nice dress."
[1:21:10] If a sister dresses long dress and nice
[1:21:14] decent dress, you never say it's pretty.
[1:21:17] The next time she dresses a little bit
[1:21:19] and she goes on the street, oh hey
[1:21:21] people look at her and then draw
[1:21:23] attention then you're so wondering why
[1:21:25] why you according to the word of God you
[1:21:28] should dress properly. Yes, but it also
[1:21:32] need to be expressed. Oh, you look
[1:21:34] beautiful today. That's so nice. Oh, I
[1:21:36] love it. Oh, thank you. Did I buy that?
[1:21:40] Oh, no. I just bought it myself. Okay.
[1:21:51] I'm preaching but I need to leave that
[1:21:53] as well. May God help me. Amen.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; How much you love her. If you don't do
[1:21:58] that, she'll never know it. That's the
[1:22:01] way. If you do love her, you express it.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; That's the way we do to God. When we
[1:22:06] love him, we tell him about it. We sit
[1:22:08] down and we adore him. We worship him.
[1:22:11] See, love drives us to that. And what if
[1:22:13] something has got to be done for your
[1:22:15] wife? Well, it will throw you into
[1:22:18] desperation to get it done. What if
[1:22:20] somebody says your wife is got cancer?
[1:22:22] If somebody says your wife got TB, she's
[1:22:25] fixing to die. Yet you will do anything.
[1:22:28] See, it will throw you into desperation.
[1:22:31] The same thing as well has to happen to
[1:22:32] our brothers and sisters. If if
[1:22:35] [snorts and clears throat] there is a
[1:22:35] problem or there's a need, we need to
[1:22:37] express that through the love. It need
[1:22:39] to be expressed. brothers you know I
[1:22:41] miss you the church I don't see I didn't
[1:22:43] see you I miss you where are you and
[1:22:45] that connection needs to be there
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; if there is not that connection no I can
[1:22:50] say you can't just say I have agapa I
[1:22:52] want them to be saved no it need to be
[1:22:54] expressed it need to be shown it need to
[1:22:56] be manifested it need to be it need to
[1:22:58] be need it need to become real as if it
[1:23:01] was expressed with feelior love even God
[1:23:04] himself loves us loves us with agapa
[1:23:07] love but God loves us also with filio
[1:23:10] He's express it in in a way that is
[1:23:12] tangible. Amen. Romans 12:10 says, "Be
[1:23:15] kindly affectionate one to another with
[1:23:18] brotherly love in order preferring one
[1:23:22] another." So brotherly love is not
[1:23:24] something to ignore is important of part
[1:23:27] of the statue of a perfect man. Is
[1:23:30] actually the platform for which the
[1:23:33] agapa love will come upon. Without
[1:23:35] brotherly love, the agapa love cannot
[1:23:38] come upon it. So it is important to have
[1:23:41] both of them. The prophet says in the
[1:23:42] super sign I think that the most and the
[1:23:45] granded word is the grandest word is
[1:23:47] love. It's broken down in two different
[1:23:49] words. The love that's called filio love
[1:23:52] that the love that we have one for
[1:23:53] another the natural one. And then there
[1:23:55] is a gap love which comes from God that
[1:23:58] the godly respect and love. I'm so glad
[1:24:01] to be here in this fellowship this
[1:24:03] afternoon where both phases of love is
[1:24:06] operating fellowship one with another
[1:24:09] and the love of God shared abroad in our
[1:24:11] hearts by the Holy Ghost. So the love of
[1:24:14] God is the most important thing the love
[1:24:16] of God but you see there are two phases.
[1:24:18] So the fellow love is one phase of the
[1:24:21] love of God.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; It's fellowship one with another. The
[1:24:25] prophet says it's important that we have
[1:24:28] fellowship with one another. We can't
[1:24:31] just rely on the love of God shed in our
[1:24:34] heart by the Holy Ghost. In it need we
[1:24:36] need also one phase which IS FELLOWSHIP
[1:24:39] WITH ONE ANOTHER. AMEN. WE NEED
[1:24:42] FELLOWSHIP WITH one another. It's
[1:24:43] important to have communion. It's
[1:24:45] important to have fellowship. It
[1:24:47] important to have interaction. Amen. A
[1:24:50] church that doesn't have interaction I
[1:24:52] would say it's just a political a
[1:24:54] political group we I I'm part of many I
[1:24:58] grew up part of many groups you know
[1:25:00] many groups we are part of it we just
[1:25:02] inter you there you listen a little bit
[1:25:04] of here and after that after the meeting
[1:25:06] is over and I close it and I go back my
[1:25:08] home I have no interaction people I just
[1:25:10] want to hear that BUT THAT'S NOT HOW IT
[1:25:13] SHOULD BE WITH CHURCH NEED INTERACTIONS
[1:25:15] YOU NEED TO SHAKE HANDS YOU NEED TO FIND
[1:25:18] OUT ABOUT YOU HOW YOU DOING AND
[1:25:20] EVERYTHING FINE? I CAN I HELP YOU? YOU
[1:25:22] NEED TO HAVE THAT INTERACTION OTHERWISE
[1:25:24] IT'S NOT A CHURCH.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; It becomes we we we can make we we we
[1:25:29] can make this we CAN WE HAVE A CHOICE
[1:25:31] EITHER TO MAKE THIS A CHURCH where
[1:25:33] believers are having fellowship real
[1:25:36] fellowship or it becomes just a clan
[1:25:38] where we meet sometimes here and there.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Amen.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Like you go to the university class, you
[1:25:47] just in that class you listen to a
[1:25:49] teacher. He teaches he teaches you and
[1:25:51] that you have not. Then you go to your
[1:25:52] own on your own room and then you
[1:25:54] continue your life. But that's not
[1:25:57] that's not church. No, there's no
[1:25:59] there's no fil love there. Do you have a
[1:26:02] gapola when you go when you go to that
[1:26:04] classroom? Yes. You want all of them to
[1:26:07] be saved. You still love them. You don't
[1:26:09] you don't you don't hate them but you
[1:26:11] don't have fellow love with them
[1:26:13] necessary. No, there's no connection.
[1:26:15] You just listen to a teacher and you go
[1:26:17] home. But that's not the same thing for
[1:26:19] church. We are brothers and sisters. WE
[1:26:23] ARE PART OF THE [screaming] FAMILY. WE
[1:26:25] ARE PART OF THE ONE BODY. WE SHOULD HAVE
[1:26:28] INTERACTIONS.
[1:26:29] YOUR STRENGTH IS MY STRENGTH. YOUR
[1:26:31] WEAKNESS IS MY WEAKNESS. IF YOU ARE
[1:26:34] WEAK, I'M ALSO WEAK BECAUSE I'M
[1:26:36] DEPENDING ON YOU. YOU ARE PART OF THE
[1:26:38] SAME BODY. AMEN. YOU CAN'T SAY READING
[1:26:41] THE word of God, YOU CAN'T SAY THIS ARM
[1:26:43] IS NOT PART OF THE EYE. WE ARE PART OF
[1:26:45] THE SAME BODY. WE ARE PART OF THE SAME
[1:26:46] CHURCH. YOUR WELLBEING IS MY WELLBEING.
[1:26:49] YOUR I WANT YOU TO BE GOOD. AMEN. I WANT
[1:26:52] YOU TO PROSPER BECAUSE
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; IF YOU DON'T PROSPER, I'M NOT PROSPERING
[1:26:57] THERE. AMEN. WE ARE PART OF THE SAME
[1:26:59] CHURCH. AMEN.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Feel your love, affection alone. Feel
[1:27:06] your love is a phase of love. They say
[1:27:09] feel your love alone fades when people
[1:27:11] disappoint us. It avoids sacrifice. It
[1:27:14] depends on mutual feeling. That's true.
[1:27:17] Agapa loves carry when feel love runs
[1:27:20] out. Without the expression love
[1:27:23] everybody can hide behind the agapa love
[1:27:26] claiming that they have the agapa love.
[1:27:29] Without the filio manifestation I would
[1:27:31] say the agapa love could look
[1:27:33] impersonal. The Bible say Jesus loved
[1:27:36] Lazarus and his sister personally. John
[1:27:39] 11 I look it up. John 11:36 that said
[1:27:42] the Jews said behold he loved him. He
[1:27:45] loved Lazarus. That love that was a
[1:27:48] filio love.
[1:27:51] But Jesus is divine.
[1:27:53] But he had a filio love. He had
[1:27:55] interaction with Lazarus. When Lazarus
[1:27:58] died in the tomb he cried. It's
[1:28:01] expression.
[1:28:03] It has to be expressed. You have to he
[1:28:06] he he put himself in in in in their
[1:28:08] shoes in their situation
[1:28:11] like a human being. IT HAS TO BE PART OF
[1:28:14] IT. OTHERWISE, WE'LL BE HIDING JUST
[1:28:16] BEHIND AGAPA AND AND WE DON'T EVEN HAVE
[1:28:19] it sometimes but we just say WE HAVE IT.
[1:28:21] NO, IT HAS TO BE EXPRESSED. HAS TO BE
[1:28:25] SHOWN. AMEN.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; SOMEONE who's in need you you it has to
[1:28:28] be shown. YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE. SISTER,
[1:28:31] IS IT OKAY WITH YOUR FAMILY? MY BROTHER,
[1:28:33] IS IT OKAY? Is it fine with your job? IS
[1:28:35] IT?
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; IT HAS TO BE PART OF IT. [screaming]
[1:28:38] AMEN.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; The Bible says John 5:20 say the father
[1:28:45] loveth the son and showed him all things
[1:28:47] that himself do. Look it up in the
[1:28:49] Bible. FILO LOVE. GOD HAVING filio love.
[1:28:53] Think about it. It kind of blew my mind
[1:28:55] a little bit because I thought God is
[1:28:57] only agap love. Yeah, he expressed it
[1:28:59] with filio love, too.
[1:29:04] It emphasized the fellowship in
[1:29:06] affections. John 16:27, for the father
[1:29:09] himself loves you because you have loved
[1:29:12] me and have believed. We have believed
[1:29:15] that I came out from God. That one was
[1:29:17] also feel love. It was a relationship
[1:29:20] closeness is a friendship. Jesus
[1:29:23] affection shows that the father loved
[1:29:26] him. It has an expression towards him.
[1:29:28] Not just a duty or not just a
[1:29:30] commandment, not just a a something that
[1:29:32] is that is not being manifested. It has
[1:29:35] to be manifested. So brotherly kindness
[1:29:38] is is part of a Christian virtue. One
[1:29:41] more time, it's growing out of godly
[1:29:43] character leading towards agapa. Like I
[1:29:47] said earlier, it's a platform for the
[1:29:49] capstone to lay on. It was the virtue of
[1:29:53] the Laudisian age. We are in the bright
[1:29:55] age but it was the virtue of the loudian
[1:29:58] age. Without heat it the capstone could
[1:30:00] not find a platform where it could lay
[1:30:02] on. So it's just so important. Amen.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; And from here we can go different places
[1:30:13] but
[1:30:19] we have made it a habit just calling
[1:30:21] brothers and sisters.
[1:30:23] And I just want to say here when you say
[1:30:25] brotherly love is a brother is a is a
[1:30:27] love for your brother is a love for your
[1:30:29] sister and sometimes we have make it
[1:30:31] just calling brother and sisters as a
[1:30:34] habit and we lose the meaning of it
[1:30:37] but if you really take a moment to think
[1:30:40] about it is my brother is my sister we
[1:30:44] have a little bit of connection to
[1:30:45] natural it's like in the when in the in
[1:30:48] in the family body when is your brother
[1:30:50] when is my sister as my brother was here
[1:30:52] I will tell tell you when this was at my
[1:30:55] place I felt so good that my brother in
[1:30:58] the flesh was there I felt happy I felt
[1:31:02] good if the same thing can be also for
[1:31:05] the brothers in the church as really my
[1:31:08] brother my real family I think we'll
[1:31:11] come to a certain level that is a little
[1:31:12] bit higher
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; we will become less indifferent to one
[1:31:17] another
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; because sometimes we become too
[1:31:20] indifferent right oh that's just his
[1:31:22] problem that's just know that we we we
[1:31:24] lose that connection between oursel
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; sometimes
[1:31:31] sharing brother I'm a shy person it
[1:31:33] doesn't look like it but I'm a shy
[1:31:34] person I'm a very shy person or maybe I
[1:31:38] used to be shy and
[1:31:42] I feel embarrassed I'm not necessarily a
[1:31:44] contact person but I'm making an effort
[1:31:47] making an effort to greet you and ask
[1:31:50] you and a little bit of time and maybe I
[1:31:51] I lack words and I'm not a communicator
[1:31:54] as a per se, but I'm making that effort
[1:31:57] because it it's part of it. I realize
[1:31:59] it's part of it. You have to connect
[1:32:01] with people. You can't just say, "No,
[1:32:03] I'm too spiritual and stay on my
[1:32:05] corner." No, you have to connect with
[1:32:07] people. It's part of it in order to put
[1:32:11] sometimes sometimes there people who
[1:32:13] some people who calls me more than
[1:32:15] others in this church.
[1:32:18] I would tell you I feel so connected to
[1:32:21] them
[1:32:22] than others. It's just normal. Not I
[1:32:25] don't love you but they just oh I'm
[1:32:28] there with them. One pastor brother
[1:32:31] Boris said
[1:32:33] the sheep that cries the most. I don't
[1:32:36] know if they say that the sheep you take
[1:32:38] care of the most.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; It's just natural. And thank God it's
[1:32:43] part of the statue of perfect man. If
[1:32:45] there is no connection, you just you you
[1:32:47] just become okay. Okay. But when there
[1:32:50] is that connection, it brings bonds. It
[1:32:53] it it's it firm. I'm encouraging the
[1:32:55] church to create that connections.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Thank God for what we had on the 31st.
[1:32:59] It was good to have that connection. It
[1:33:02] brings us closer. It bring us as a
[1:33:04] family. We know each other a little BIT
[1:33:06] BETTER. IT'S PART OF THE CHURCH.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; A CHURCH CAN'T BE STRONG WITHOUT THAT
[1:33:11] CONNECTION. You can't be just alone by
[1:33:13] yourself. I'm just a single. I come here
[1:33:15] and I and I disappear. Just wonder is
[1:33:18] message f
[1:33:21] don't know your name. We don't know
[1:33:22] anything.
[1:33:24] But but when we'll be in eternity we
[1:33:26] spend eternity together.
[1:33:32] [laughter]
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; we are missing something.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Thank God for bringing the balance on
[1:33:41] Lord. Brother Baram, brother Baram liked
[1:33:44] connection. You remember brother Bam
[1:33:46] says you know for his wife talking
[1:33:49] walking with the wife and the other one
[1:33:52] say hello sister Ma sister
[1:33:56] she pass says she greeted you. Yeah I
[1:34:00] responded I just I just smiled said
[1:34:05] what's that?
[1:34:07] That's that's not real. She she greeted
[1:34:10] you and greet back.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; HELLO, HOW ARE [screaming] YOU?
[1:34:14] EVERYTHING IS GOOD. Praise be to God.
[1:34:17] No, just and then you
[1:34:19] say and easy. Oh, she need a silly
[1:34:22] green. He call it a silly green. That's
[1:34:24] you need a real handshake AND SAY YEAH.
[1:34:28] HOW ARE YOU DOING? GOD BLESS YOU. PRAISE
[1:34:31] BE TO GOD.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Take it up in the message. Many times he
[1:34:36] says, you know, oh brotherly love, we
[1:34:39] used to have it back then, but we don't
[1:34:41] have it anymore in our churches. We
[1:34:44] don't have it anymore. We found out that
[1:34:46] the other the the neighbor died. We find
[1:34:48] out in the newspaper.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; We don't know what our neighbor is going
[1:34:53] through.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; That's in a nutshell. But also in our
[1:34:56] church sometimes WE DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU
[1:34:58] ARE going through.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; But then we will find out one day you
[1:35:02] know I was going through this. I was
[1:35:05] going through this, you know, no, no one
[1:35:06] cared for me. Huh? No connection. YOU
[1:35:10] ISOLATING YOURSELF AND
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; BRING TOGETHER.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; BRING TOGETHER.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; I HAVE I'M GOING through this. I'm going
[1:35:17] through this problem.
[1:35:20] Can you pray for me? We pray for you. It
[1:35:22] brings connection. We feel part of one
[1:35:25] another. We move together. YOUR
[1:35:27] SUFFERING IS OUR SUFFERING. IF WE ARE
[1:35:29] NOT MATURE YET, HELP US TO GET MATURE SO
[1:35:32] THAT WE FEEL THAT. WE NEED THAT AS WELL.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; WE CAN'T JUST BE LIKE A CHURCH. THERE IS
[1:35:37] NO PROBLEM. WE HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS,
[1:35:39] BUT WE ARE HIDING IT OURSELVES. NO, I
[1:35:41] DON'T KNOW.
[1:35:43] But you're not helping yours to move
[1:35:45] around.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Maybe your PROBLEM IS TO HELP ME TO FEEL
[1:35:50] COMPASSIONATE.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; If I don't feel compassionate, GOD MAY
[1:35:53] GOD CORRECT ME.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; We will find out two years, five years
[1:36:00] after that.
[1:36:02] That's not I think we are missing
[1:36:05] something.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; That's my point of view. I think we are
[1:36:08] missing something.
[1:36:18] So it's more than just a group. I'm
[1:36:19] sorry. Said sometimes in the church you
[1:36:22] can have a church within a church.
[1:36:26] There's a church as a body and people
[1:36:28] can join. That's true. But there's also
[1:36:30] a church where there is also a little
[1:36:32] bit of connection and people feel
[1:36:35] together part of the family and I want
[1:36:38] that to be part of the family.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; As we so this is my family we will spend
[1:36:45] eternity together
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; as as brother Andrew said one time if we
[1:36:49] can't if we can't spend a little bit of
[1:36:53] eternity here
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; where what eternity are we going to
[1:36:57] spend together?
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; So true.
[1:37:04] Brother will talk the order of
[1:37:05] resurrection. says I I know the people I
[1:37:09] know and I'll be the final voice to the
[1:37:11] final age when I'm being my my
[1:37:15] resurrection will bring the resurrection
[1:37:16] of the other one the resurrection of the
[1:37:18] other one that the other resurrection
[1:37:20] it's going backwards right from what the
[1:37:22] people you know you know you know you
[1:37:24] know so if there is no connection
[1:37:27] there's no knowing
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; what resurrection are you going to be
[1:37:30] just your own resurrection but there's
[1:37:33] no backwards resurrection
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; wow
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; no connection
[1:37:43] the believer's position in Christ. The
[1:37:45] same spirit that was in Christ is in you
[1:37:47] and in me and you are fellow citizens.
[1:37:50] Oh my, that's the word I want to be
[1:37:52] playing around in Africa to get fellow
[1:37:55] citizens of the spiritual kingdom.
[1:37:58] Citizenships, aren't you happy to get
[1:38:01] into in tonight? We are citizenship. We
[1:38:05] are citizens of the same kingdom.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; We are part of the same kingdom. Amen.
[1:38:11] Whether nationality sometimes in the
[1:38:13] natural you are born here, you are born
[1:38:14] here, you are born here. That's not the
[1:38:16] most important thing. The most important
[1:38:18] thing we are part of the same family in
[1:38:20] Christ.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I don't even like that express
[1:38:24] you know and and and it's getting around
[1:38:26] now. Sometimes I hear from this no
[1:38:29] restored word fellowship is the church
[1:38:31] of the congalles of the church of the
[1:38:33] Africans. No, that's not the church of
[1:38:35] the Africans. That the church of
[1:38:37] believers.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; That the church of Christians. We are
[1:38:40] all citizens OF THE SAME KINGDOM.
[1:38:44] THERE'S no Congali. There's no
[1:38:45] Zimbabwean. There's no Ghanaian. There's
[1:38:47] no Nigerian. There's no Canadian.
[1:38:49] There's no German. WE ARE ALL CITIZEN OF
[1:38:52] THE SAME KINGDOM.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; AND WE ARE PART OF THE SAME BODY OF
[1:38:56] JESUS CHRIST. AMEN.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; MY SISTERS FROM COLOMBIA, WE ARE ALL
[1:39:00] PART OF THE SAME OF THE SAME KINGDOM OF
[1:39:03] GOD.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S WHY sometime you know I I
[1:39:07] sang on sang the song in French last I I
[1:39:10] had it in my heart for a long time. I
[1:39:12] mean yeah but some I
[1:39:16] I want the whole church to benefit.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we we want everybody to
[1:39:20] benefit. It's not only French. It it
[1:39:23] lingual. YOU CAN SING IN THE but make
[1:39:26] sure that when you are singing, you make
[1:39:28] EVERYBODY ELSE BE PART OF IT BECAUSE IT
[1:39:31] THE SAME CHURCH FOR EVERYBODY. WE WANT
[1:39:33] EVERYBODY TO BE EDIFIED.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ONLY ONE PART, NOT EVERYBODY.
[1:39:38] THE CHURCH OF ALL THE NATIONS. AMEN.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Is it okay?
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; We don't want division in the church. We
[1:39:48] don't want clans in the church. We don't
[1:39:50] want a group of only this. This is a
[1:39:53] group only of Filipinos. This is a group
[1:39:55] only of of of Congalles. This only
[1:39:57] Zimbabwean of Ghanaians. No, we don't
[1:40:00] want that. No. No. It's the WHOLE CHURCH
[1:40:03] FOR JESUS CHRIST.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; It says
[1:40:17] I belong to the Baptist church and in
[1:40:19] that spirit was going the banana was so
[1:40:21] against it. We are all working for one
[1:40:23] place. I belong to the Baptist church
[1:40:25] the assemblies to the oneness to the the
[1:40:27] threeness or the fiveness or whatever it
[1:40:29] was. We want to be working for one
[1:40:32] principle. That's for our heavenly
[1:40:34] father to get bornag again Christians
[1:40:37] into that kingdom up there. It's not
[1:40:40] about group. It's not about ethnicity.
[1:40:43] It's not even by your preference. You
[1:40:45] know that in this church we have many we
[1:40:47] have many Catholics.
[1:40:50] We have many Baptist. We have many
[1:40:52] Pentecostals. We have we have different
[1:40:54] groups in this church here. But they are
[1:40:56] born again.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; They have been changed. means by that I
[1:41:00] mean you you are sometimes inclined to
[1:41:03] certain things. I call myself a baptist
[1:41:06] born again because I like fundamentals.
[1:41:09] I like teaching. I like that that's my
[1:41:11] way. I'm made up and I am but there are
[1:41:14] some people that are Pentecostals.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Born again. They like the shouting. They
[1:41:18] like hallelujah. They like oh yeah when
[1:41:21] it's their time I'm also joining them.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Amen.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; There are some people just metalist
[1:41:30] [laughter]
[1:41:32] that moment for them too. Sometimes a
[1:41:34] song of and sometimes you see me
[1:41:37] sometimes I cry. I I I become medist at
[1:41:39] that time too. THANK GOD WE ARE ALL
[1:41:43] [screaming] OF THE SAME GROUP.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Don't form any spirit of clan or any
[1:41:47] spirit OF DIVISION HERE. NO BROTHERLY
[1:41:51] KINDNESS [screaming]
[1:41:51] AMONG US
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; TO MAKE A PLATFORM FOR THE CAPSTONE.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; But says a true minister
[1:42:07] to call the church one big body. A true
[1:42:09] minister will never draw lines. Just
[1:42:11] because you don't believe with me,
[1:42:13] you're not in it. No. We all recognize
[1:42:16] one another as brothers because Jesus
[1:42:19] died for all of us.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Jesus died for all of us. So we don't
[1:42:23] want any division. Amen. Amen. Sometimes
[1:42:26] we defer on our gifts. We defer on our
[1:42:28] functions. We defer on a on a way of
[1:42:31] expressing one another. And it's okay.
[1:42:34] Jesus Christ did not pray. This is my
[1:42:36] note. Jesus Christ did not pray for for
[1:42:38] for for uniformity that everybody to be
[1:42:41] the same way to speak the same way to
[1:42:44] have the same tonality you know that's
[1:42:46] not how he called us to be and we can
[1:42:48] never be the same Andrew and Peter were
[1:42:52] different Peter was just the one who is
[1:42:54] exuberant and andrew was a little bit
[1:42:56] was calm and everything but both of them
[1:42:58] were part of the kingdom of God your
[1:43:01] nature you can be a little bit quiet the
[1:43:02] other one is more EXPER AND THANK GOD
[1:43:05] AMEN
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; SO NO, NO, NO. I DON'T WANT THAT. GO
[1:43:08] THAT CHURCH, AFRICAN CHURCH. A LOT OF
[1:43:10] NOISE.
[1:43:12] You are missing something. AMEN.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE JUST EXPRESSING THE WAY THEY
[1:43:15] ARE.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD. HALLELUJAH. LET THEM
[1:43:18] EXPRESS THE WAY THEY ARE. [screaming]
[1:43:19] AND SOMETIMES THEY'RE ALSO AFRICANS WHO
[1:43:21] ARE QUIET.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Me and brother Abel. We are VERY QUIET.
[1:43:24] WHERE'S BROTHER ABEL?
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; WE ARE VERY QUIET BROTHERS. AND THAT'S
[1:43:28] HOW WE ARE.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; But he called us to be one. to be one.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; Not to have uniformity, but to be one.
[1:43:39] Amen.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; John 17:11 says, "Now I am no I am no
[1:43:44] more in the world, but these are in the
[1:43:45] world that I come into thee. Holy
[1:43:47] Father, keep through thine own name
[1:43:50] those whom you have given me that they
[1:43:52] may be one as we [clears throat] are."
[1:43:54] We want to be one. The love of God will
[1:43:57] bring us to be one. Amen.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; That they may all be one. Thou Father
[1:44:01] art in me and I in them. That they also
[1:44:04] may be one in us. that the world may
[1:44:05] believe that thou has sent me. The glory
[1:44:08] that which thest me, I have given them
[1:44:10] that they may be one even as we are one
[1:44:13] in them and thou in me and they be made
[1:44:15] perfect in one that the world may know
[1:44:18] that they have sent me and I loved me
[1:44:20] and I love thou has loved me. How will
[1:44:23] the world know that we are Christians
[1:44:25] when we have love for one another?
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; It's not how when we teach one another.
[1:44:32] It's not how we know more than than
[1:44:35] others. No, the world will know when we
[1:44:37] have love for one another.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO EXERCISE THAT LOVE FOR ONE
[1:44:42] ANOTHER. IT'S IMPORTANT to exercise that
[1:44:45] love for one another.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Brother love allows us to appreciate
[1:44:49] different callings without jealousy.
[1:44:52] Recognize sincere believers beyond
[1:44:54] denominational doctrinal lines. To walk
[1:44:56] together in humility while still growing
[1:44:58] in truth. Amen. So 1 Corinthians 12, he
[1:45:02] put it very well. 1 Corinthians 12 comes
[1:45:04] before 1 Corinthians 13, which is the
[1:45:08] charity, the agap love. But he's
[1:45:10] stressing in 1 Corinthians 12 about the
[1:45:13] gift about the the love. Listen to what
[1:45:15] he's saying as you bear with me. If you
[1:45:17] can go that I just go through this this
[1:45:19] this the scripture I think is the one
[1:45:20] that that summarize everything so well.
[1:45:23] So there are diversities of gift but the
[1:45:26] same spirit. 1 Corinthians 12:4. There
[1:45:29] are diversities of gift but the same
[1:45:31] spirit. There are differences of
[1:45:33] administrations by the same Lord. There
[1:45:35] are diversities of operations but it is
[1:45:37] the same God which workketh all in all.
[1:45:42] So it's God in the song service. I
[1:45:45] believe it's God in the deacons.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; It's God in the Sunday school
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; teachers. It's God in the ministry here.
[1:45:54] Different gift but the same God. AMEN.
[1:45:57] THERE'S NO ONE THAT IS GREATER THAN the
[1:45:59] other. WE ALL NEED ALL OF THEM FOR THE
[1:46:01] CHURCH TO OPERATE. There is we need you
[1:46:04] your special when there people singing
[1:46:07] specials here. THE MUSICIANS WE NEED ONE
[1:46:09] ANOTHER DIFFERENT GIFT BUT THE SAME GOD
[1:46:12] AND WE RESPECT AND AND CHERISH EACH GIFT
[1:46:15] IN THE IN THE BODY OF CHRIST.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; And he says but the manifestation of the
[1:46:20] spirit is given to every man to profit
[1:46:22] without. So those manifestations are for
[1:46:25] us to profit. For to one is given by the
[1:46:27] spirit the word of wisdom, to another
[1:46:29] the word of knowledge by the same
[1:46:31] spirit, to another faith by the same
[1:46:33] spirit, to another the gift of healing
[1:46:35] by the same spirit, to another the
[1:46:37] working of miracles, to another
[1:46:38] prophecy, to another discerning of
[1:46:40] spirit, to another diverse kinds of
[1:46:42] tongues, to another the interpretation
[1:46:44] of tongues. But all these work of that
[1:46:46] one and the same all these work of that
[1:46:50] one and the same spirit dividing to
[1:46:52] every man severally as he will. You know
[1:46:55] sometimes we have made mistakes in the
[1:46:57] past where we have overemphasized only
[1:47:00] one gift.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; You know the message went through two
[1:47:05] phases right at some point in during the
[1:47:08] during the day it was only one gift. If
[1:47:11] you don't preach like my pastor
[1:47:13] preaches, I don't feel the anointing.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; And we made that gift that oh that that
[1:47:19] that's the gift.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, oh,
[1:47:23] everybody has oh miracles. IF THERE IS
[1:47:27] NO MIRACLES, NO, THEN THEN THEN
[1:47:30] WE EMPHASIZE ONLY ON THAT AND WE MAKE it
[1:47:33] I would say we make it a a a a
[1:47:35] denominations
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; because it becomes just the focus of
[1:47:39] everything. It's important and I want IT
[1:47:42] AND WE DESIRE IT and our church we have
[1:47:45] it
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; BUT WE NEED TO HAVE ALL OF THEM.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; SOME OF THEM just they have wisdom. Some
[1:47:51] people just have the gift of wisdom.
[1:47:53] Some ministry can be built just on the
[1:47:55] wisdom and and he's just advising and
[1:47:57] giving a small that's the way it built
[1:48:00] and if that the way it is PRAISE BE TO
[1:48:02] GOD
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; ALL OF THEM WE NEED THEM. IT'S NOT ONLY
[1:48:06] ONE GIFT THAT THAT HAS TO TO BE THE TOP
[1:48:08] OF ALL THE OTHER GIFT. NO, WE NEED ONE
[1:48:11] ANOTHER.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; THE PASTOR is he is IN GOD'S EYES. THE
[1:48:18] ONE brother say the one place the one
[1:48:20] who got saved yesterday
[1:48:22] is important in God's eyes
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; as the ministers.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Just got saved yesterday.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Is as important the ministers have been
[1:48:32] for 40 years
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; in God's eye. But you know why sometimes
[1:48:36] we try to make one bigger than the other
[1:48:38] one? No, we just need one another.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; The prophet says discernment of the
[1:48:48] spirit. There is so much in the day that
[1:48:49] we live in pertaining to gift. So many
[1:48:52] people judge people by gift that they
[1:48:55] have.
[1:48:58] And I always say sometimes it it gift
[1:49:01] can be deceiving.
[1:49:05] You can have a gift but you don't have a
[1:49:07] relationship with God.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; And you just rely on your gift and you
[1:49:12] think you are saved because of that
[1:49:14] gift. No,
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; salvation is not based on your merit.
[1:49:19] It's not based on that free gift of
[1:49:21] natural gift you have. No, you still
[1:49:24] need the blood of Jesus Christ. You
[1:49:26] still need to be born again. Even with
[1:49:29] that gift, even if you have a good
[1:49:31] preacher, I'm I'm just talking to
[1:49:33] myself. If you're not a good preachers
[1:49:35] that people don't see, I'm pointing to
[1:49:37] them. You have a good preachers and
[1:49:39] anything, but you still need the blood
[1:49:42] of Jesus Christ.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Some people have just the gift of
[1:49:50] healing.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; And I' I've seen that in my life. Just
[1:49:56] just pray for a simple prayer and you're
[1:49:58] healed.
[1:50:00] Oh, how many people flock that and
[1:50:04] and then sometimes they distort the word
[1:50:06] of God
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; but people don't see it because they see
[1:50:08] just the gift.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, but you are being this there is
[1:50:13] there is a there is there is there's
[1:50:14] probability to be deceived there. No,
[1:50:17] the gift doesn't confirm.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; it's the word of God that confirms the
[1:50:22] gift,
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; not the other way around. So don't be
[1:50:25] deceived by gift. Even those who have
[1:50:28] gifts, don't be deceived by the same
[1:50:29] gift you have only. You you need to work
[1:50:32] on that gift. You need still to have
[1:50:34] brother say every gift is a ministry.
[1:50:36] You need to pray. You need to dedicate
[1:50:38] yourself. YOU NEED TO SANCTIFY YOURSELF.
[1:50:40] THAT WORD IS CONFIRMING THAT GIFT. DON'T
[1:50:43] neglect the gift that INSIDE OF YOU. HOW
[1:50:45] CAN YOU NEGLECT that gift? IF YOU DON'T
[1:50:47] PRAY, if you don't read the Bible, if
[1:50:49] you don't consecrate yourself, you are
[1:50:51] neglecting that gift.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:55] So many people judge people. So many
[1:50:57] people judge people by the gift they
[1:50:59] have. Well, I believe that these things
[1:51:01] are gift. I believe that we see take
[1:51:03] place is gift and they are Godgiven
[1:51:06] gift. But if we if we do not use them in
[1:51:10] the right way that God intending them to
[1:51:13] be used, then we can do more harm with
[1:51:16] the gift than we could if we did not
[1:51:19] have the gift.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:23] Oh God, help us.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; Help us so that we use those gift for
[1:51:28] your glory and for your honor.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; Not to exalt ourself, not to not to
[1:51:34] prove ourself, not for our own
[1:51:36] popularity, not not to be loved, not no
[1:51:39] that's not how God give the gift those
[1:51:43] gift is to glorify God and God only.
[1:51:47] Amen.
[1:51:48] Good thing that he says in that message
[1:51:50] the discernment of the spirit says if I
[1:51:53] had discernment of spirit enough to know
[1:51:54] that's wrong no matter how great a
[1:51:56] teacher is how powerful is how
[1:51:58] intellectually is or how his gifts
[1:52:00] operate if it isn't trying to achieve
[1:52:02] something for the benefit of the body of
[1:52:05] Christ your own spiritual discernment
[1:52:07] will tell you that that's wrong no
[1:52:09] matter how accurate how perfect how it
[1:52:12] is it's wrong if it isn't used for the
[1:52:15] body of Jesus Christ
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; to achieve something. Maybe it's God a
[1:52:19] great gift that he could draw people
[1:52:21] together with a great intellectual or a
[1:52:24] spiritual power that he could draw
[1:52:25] people together. Maybe he's trying to
[1:52:27] take that gift and make himself famous
[1:52:30] so that you will have a big name so that
[1:52:32] other brethren will look up to him as
[1:52:34] some big person said that's wrong. Maybe
[1:52:38] he's trying to edify a certain thing
[1:52:41] here that he wants everybody has to get
[1:52:43] out of the picture and let him and his
[1:52:45] group be the picture. That's still
[1:52:47] wrong.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; But if he has a gift of God and he's
[1:52:51] trying to edify to edify the body of
[1:52:54] Christ, I don't care what he belongs to.
[1:52:57] We are not discerning the man. We are
[1:52:59] discerning the spirit, the life that's
[1:53:01] in the man.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; That's what God has told us to do. Not
[1:53:06] at one time was he ever commissioned to
[1:53:07] discern the man group, but he was
[1:53:10] constrained and commanded by God to
[1:53:12] discern the spirit in the man. What he's
[1:53:14] trying to do, what the spirit in his
[1:53:16] life is trying to lead him to. And when
[1:53:19] if we can find out that he's trying to
[1:53:20] lead the people, not to break them up,
[1:53:22] but to bring them together, to bring the
[1:53:24] church of the living God to not all to
[1:53:28] one denomination, but to an
[1:53:29] understanding, a fellowship, a unity
[1:53:32] with Christ. That was my prayer, Lord. I
[1:53:35] don't want to bring people to me. I
[1:53:38] don't want people to love me because of
[1:53:40] my natural character or anything. No, I
[1:53:43] want to bring people to you, Christ.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; I'm a unique. I have no seed. I have no
[1:53:48] life on myself.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; I want them to receive your life, your
[1:53:52] Holy Spirit. Father, I want to prepare
[1:53:54] them for the rapture. I don't have power
[1:53:57] to rapture any person. YOU, LORD, HAVE
[1:53:59] THE power to rapture THEM. IT'S YOUR
[1:54:01] BRIDE. IT'S NOT MY PEOPLE. LORD, LEAD
[1:54:04] YOUR PEOPLE. FATHER, GIVE THEM THE HOLY
[1:54:06] SPIRIT. HELP ME JUST TO BE THERE AS A
[1:54:09] HELPER TO EDIFY THEM. BUT IT'S YOUR
[1:54:11] PEOPLE, LORD.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; BLESS YOUR PEOPLE, LORD.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; And if I'm staying a little bit away,
[1:54:20] help me to bring me back in the right
[1:54:22] balance.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; I'm a good listener. I will listen.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; Because I want people to be part of the
[1:54:31] fellowship with God. Amen.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; Says the spirit that's in him, no matter
[1:54:41] what move it belongs to, the spirit in
[1:54:43] him is trying to point the people to
[1:54:45] Calvary away from himself and away from
[1:54:47] anything else. But his only achievement,
[1:54:50] he has to point them to Calvary. He
[1:54:52] doesn't care whether he's even n or not.
[1:54:55] Doesn't care whether even his own
[1:54:56] movement, which is fine. It's good if
[1:54:59] he's a Methodist, a Presbyterian, a
[1:55:00] Roman Catholic, whatever he wants to be
[1:55:02] by denomination. But what he's trying to
[1:55:04] do, the purpose of his heart that he's
[1:55:06] trying to get, then you can see what's
[1:55:08] in the man's life. Whether he his
[1:55:10] motives for his denomination or whether
[1:55:13] it is for himself, whether it is for the
[1:55:14] worldly fame, whether it's for big names
[1:55:17] to say I predict that come just exactly
[1:55:19] to pass. So someone can say I predict
[1:55:21] that and it just came to pass. So I'm
[1:55:22] the one you see that's a wrong right
[1:55:25] there to begin with. But if he's trying
[1:55:27] to use what God has given him as a
[1:55:29] teacher, as a prophet, as a seer and etc
[1:55:32] to edify the people and bring them to
[1:55:34] Christ, that's the most important thing.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; At the same time, the victory day says,
[1:55:44] "Brother love, we should have for one
[1:55:46] another and understand one another and
[1:55:48] to love one another and to worship with
[1:55:51] one another." They sometimes people they
[1:55:54] degrade a man because of his clothes. he
[1:55:56] wears the education he has the color of
[1:55:59] his skin or something like that.
[1:56:01] Therefore, it separates the people and
[1:56:03] makes them off take them off of that. It
[1:56:05] never gives the unward man a chance to
[1:56:07] operate. We are in tune in soul, body
[1:56:10] and spirit.
[1:56:12] Jesus came to the Samaritan woman. She
[1:56:15] almost missed it. Says, "Why are you
[1:56:18] talking to me? You are a Jew. We are
[1:56:20] Samaritans.
[1:56:21] We have no relationship with you." It's
[1:56:24] as if you knew the gift was this is just
[1:56:27] talking to you.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Go beyond the nationalities. Go beyond
[1:56:31] the things. Go beyond the culture. Go
[1:56:33] beyond the color of skin. Go beyond all
[1:56:35] those different things. Go beyond all
[1:56:38] that brothers and sisters.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; Then you can see the Christ in the
[1:56:43] brother, the Christ in the sister. Amen.
[1:56:46] Beyond all that.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; And you have you have you have the
[1:56:50] spirit flowing through you. Amen.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we look at the natural things
[1:56:56] and oh
[1:56:58] may God help us. Amen. Brother love,
[1:57:02] closeness, connection.
[1:57:08] If you take those gift that we have now,
[1:57:10] we say in a good way and use them
[1:57:12] correctly and orderly in the church,
[1:57:14] this little church will grow like
[1:57:16] everything.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; And we want this church to grow like
[1:57:20] everything. But let the gift of God
[1:57:22] operate correctly in the body of Christ.
[1:57:26] We brotherly love with divine love. All
[1:57:30] that together. Praise be to God.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 12. But as the body is one
[1:57:41] have many members and all members of of
[1:57:43] one body being many are one body also is
[1:57:46] Christ. For by one spirit are we all
[1:57:49] baptized into one body. Whether we be
[1:57:51] Jews or Gentiles, see his workers.
[1:57:54] Whether we be born or free, have be all
[1:57:57] made to drink into one spirit. For the
[1:57:59] body is not one member, but many. If the
[1:58:02] foot shall say, "Because I'm not the
[1:58:04] hand, I'm not of the I'm not of the
[1:58:06] body." Is it therefore not of the body?
[1:58:09] If the ear shall say, "Because I'm not
[1:58:11] the eye, I'm not of the body." If Is it
[1:58:14] therefore not of the body? If the whole
[1:58:16] body was an eye, where where were the
[1:58:20] hearing?
[1:58:21] Just imagine if your whole body was just
[1:58:24] an eye.
[1:58:28] If the whole were hearing, where this
[1:58:31] where were the smelling? But now, as God
[1:58:34] said to the members, every one of them
[1:58:36] in the body as he has pleased him. If
[1:58:39] they were all one member, where were the
[1:58:42] body? But how are they many members? yet
[1:58:45] by one body. If the eye cannot say unto
[1:58:48] the hand, I have no need of thee.
[1:58:51] Nor again the head to the feet, I have
[1:58:54] no need of you. Name much more those
[1:58:57] members of the body which seem to be
[1:58:59] more feeble and necessary. And those
[1:59:02] member of the body which we think to be
[1:59:04] less honorable upon these we bestow more
[1:59:06] abundant honor and our undily part have
[1:59:09] more abundant candiness. Sometimes
[1:59:12] that's what we think. I'm I'm I'm not
[1:59:14] I'm not useful to the to the church when
[1:59:16] I'm there. When I'm not there, there's
[1:59:18] no difference, you know.
[1:59:21] [snorts] Nobody cares about I'm just
[1:59:23] nothing. Oh yeah. Thank you for that
[1:59:25] humility.
[1:59:27] Sometimes don't put that humility too
[1:59:29] far.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; The church needs you.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; The church needs you. Like the part of
[1:59:36] the body you don't Have you ever hidden
[1:59:40] sometimes one of the fingers? You don't
[1:59:41] care about it. But the day you hit now,
[1:59:44] now you realize that every time you move
[1:59:46] anything, it connect with that one. Oh.
[1:59:49] Oh. Oh. So it's that important though. I
[1:59:52] didn't know that I was holding this
[1:59:53] until Oh, that's so that's God when
[1:59:57] looks at us, he needs each one of you in
[2:00:00] the church. WHY DO YOU FEEL LIKE
[2:00:02] IMPORTANT not important? There is a
[2:00:04] PLACE FOR YOU. AMEN.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE A BLESSING FOR SOMEONE ELSE.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; This is something that is boiling in my
[2:00:10] heart. Maybe I might preach this is the
[2:00:12] message influence.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; You are always influencing someone.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; Always whether you don't sometimes you
[2:00:20] are not aware of it but you are still
[2:00:22] influencing someone. Now think sometimes
[2:00:24] we take some actions in our lives here.
[2:00:26] We think that I just myself I did it and
[2:00:29] then it's okay. No it is repercussions
[2:00:33] because someone was watching you and you
[2:00:36] have been influencing her. What if what
[2:00:39] you are doing everybody has to do what
[2:00:41] you're doing? What will be the church?
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; I always ask my wife and sometimes I
[2:00:47] just think about what you're doing. If
[2:00:49] everybody in the church was doing what
[2:00:51] you're doing,
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; what will be the church? If what I'm
[2:00:55] doing everybody was doing what I'm
[2:00:56] doing, what will be the church?
[2:01:02] Influence one another. Part of the
[2:01:05] message. My life influences you. Your
[2:01:07] life is influencing me or is influencing
[2:01:11] my kids? Is he influencing a teenager?
[2:01:14] So this always that
[2:01:17] may God help us.
[2:01:27] For our family part have no need. But
[2:01:29] God has tempered the body together,
[2:01:32] having given more abundant honor to that
[2:01:34] part which lackth. that there should be
[2:01:36] no schism in the body, but he that
[2:01:39] members should have the same care one
[2:01:42] for another in brotherly love to care
[2:01:46] for one for another.
[2:01:49] Amen.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; May God help us.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; May God help us.
[2:01:56] Give me a few more minutes. We're
[2:01:58] closing soon and get there for some part
[2:02:01] I won't touch but
[2:02:05] says God oh God if we have to take every
[2:02:08] miracle
[2:02:11] now read again the scripture verse 26
[2:02:14] where the one member suffer all the
[2:02:15] members suffer with it one member be
[2:02:18] honored all the members rejoice with it
[2:02:21] now we are the body of Christ and
[2:02:22] members in particular and God has said
[2:02:25] some in the church first apostles
[2:02:27] Secondly, prophet. Thirdly, teachers.
[2:02:29] After that, miracles. Then gift of
[2:02:30] healings helps government diversity of
[2:02:34] tongues. The prophet says, "Oh God, if
[2:02:37] we have to take every miracles out of
[2:02:39] the church, if we have to take all the
[2:02:41] pipe organs out and the flash pews and
[2:02:44] give us back to and give us back to that
[2:02:48] godly love, brotherly love among the
[2:02:51] people and fellowship. If we have to do
[2:02:53] all that, take it back to that again.
[2:02:56] life life once again said that's not
[2:02:58] life some people is brought to a place
[2:03:00] to get him drunk and then it goes on
[2:03:02] then it says another place says divine
[2:03:04] love says we have faced a day when it
[2:03:06] prophesied that the brotherly love will
[2:03:08] be a strange thing among people
[2:03:12] now this crying
[2:03:15] it becomes selfish life
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; becomes your own life your own own
[2:03:20] myself my my my myh I don't care becomes
[2:03:24] a separate isolated and everything loud
[2:03:28] life. No brotherly love anymore.
[2:03:32] My brother, my sister, no only in words,
[2:03:35] not in action.
[2:03:41] Says, "Prophesy that the brotherly love
[2:03:43] will become a strange thing among
[2:03:44] people. It's to my humble belief that
[2:03:46] there is the greatest of all the gift
[2:03:48] that there is in God's Bible. If the
[2:03:50] Lord Jesus should stand on the platform
[2:03:52] tonight and look me in the face and say,
[2:03:54] "I'm going to give you your choice. You
[2:03:57] be a great person, a great minister,
[2:03:59] I'll give you a gift of preaching the
[2:04:01] gospel. I'll give you the gift of
[2:04:02] teaching the word. I'll give you the
[2:04:04] gift of divine healing. I'll give you
[2:04:06] the gift of prophecy. I'll give I'll
[2:04:08] make you a prophet. And any of the fine
[2:04:10] gift of faith, any of the gift that's in
[2:04:12] the Bible, I'll give them everyone to
[2:04:15] you then. But then I will withhold love
[2:04:19] from you or either I'll give you love
[2:04:21] and withhold the gift from you. I would
[2:04:24] say Lord take all the gift and let me
[2:04:27] have the love.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; See for no matter how many gift we got,
[2:04:32] they will never do us any good except
[2:04:34] the love of God. The motive behind the
[2:04:37] gift we must have love. But then as I
[2:04:40] see this great day appearing that we are
[2:04:43] now living in where listen now where the
[2:04:45] selfishness and indifference among
[2:04:48] people, human beings, tribes of the
[2:04:51] earth, it grieves my heart. It grieves
[2:04:54] God heart when we have that indifference
[2:04:58] to one another. Sometimes ourself
[2:05:02] we we may God help us. Amen.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; And bring that divisions and talking to
[2:05:07] Corinthians. at the church that were
[2:05:09] saying you know we are from we are from
[2:05:10] Paul we are from from Cifas we are from
[2:05:13] this and we are this and those are great
[2:05:15] men good men and one of them said I mean
[2:05:18] some of them say we are for Christ we
[2:05:21] are only for for the tapes
[2:05:23] just looking for them trying to find
[2:05:25] divisions
[2:05:27] Bible says it's only for denominations
[2:05:29] no it's also in the church in message
[2:05:31] churches it's sometimes there too we try
[2:05:35] to make it the prophet says the devil
[2:05:37] doesn't want you to be united. You want
[2:05:39] to make cleans out of it. Clenish the
[2:05:41] spirit. But if you see that come no now
[2:05:44] come bind yourself together. Pray for
[2:05:46] that brother. Pray for that sister. MAKE
[2:05:49] YOURSELF ONE. AMEN. PRAY FOR ONE
[2:05:51] ANOTHER. BE UNITED. GOD MAKE US ONE in
[2:05:54] Jesus Christ.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; This is where the selfishness and
[2:06:00] indifference amongst people, human
[2:06:01] beings, tribes of the earth, it grieves
[2:06:04] my heart.
[2:06:06] Amen.
[2:06:08] I'll finish with this thought. The
[2:06:10] restoration of the bride tree as said
[2:06:13] the first thing that the Pentecost
[2:06:14] produced was brother love. Brother love
[2:06:18] Jesus said
[2:06:21] musicians can come already. I'm pray
[2:06:24] softly as I'm reading this. Says
[2:06:28] it down the middle war of partitions and
[2:06:30] made a brotherhood to such a way that
[2:06:32] they had everything in common. I mean
[2:06:34] the Bible says a brotherhood. Paul spoke
[2:06:36] of this brotherhood and he gave all the
[2:06:39] gift of the Pentecostal church. Then
[2:06:40] said in 1 Corinthians 13, "Though I
[2:06:42] speak with tongues as man and angel, I
[2:06:44] have not this love which brings the
[2:06:46] brotherhood. I'm nothing. And though I
[2:06:48] have the knowledge to understand all the
[2:06:50] mysteries of God, I'm still nothing
[2:06:51] without the love, the love of the
[2:06:53] brethren." Jesus said, "This will all
[2:06:56] men know that you are my disciples when
[2:06:58] you have love one for the other."
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. They will not know that you are my
[2:07:03] disciples when you have the message
[2:07:05] book.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; That says, "Oh, this is a message
[2:07:08] Buddhist must be a Christian." No,
[2:07:10] that's not that way. They say they will
[2:07:12] know that you are message believers when
[2:07:14] when when when you speak a certain
[2:07:16] language or speaking. No, that's not
[2:07:19] that. It's when we have the love for one
[2:07:22] another and not only love in words but
[2:07:26] love in expression, love that is being
[2:07:29] manifested, loving that is being shown.
[2:07:32] Amen. Praise be to God. As as as a
[2:07:35] brother Andrew said, it just be a token,
[2:07:37] a public thing that is shown, that is
[2:07:39] visible, that is is real. We we are we
[2:07:42] are tired of words.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; I I don't want words only that doesn't
[2:07:48] have a life. I want a real life
[2:07:50] expressed. That's what is the most
[2:07:53] important thing. God, make the love of
[2:07:55] God real in my heart, manifesting for
[2:07:58] another. Remove remove that
[2:08:01] indifference. Remove that indifference.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Make me be the one caring for the
[2:08:06] others, caring for one another.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:15] says in the same message the restoration
[2:08:18] of the bride tree. So Jesus spoke this
[2:08:20] and said Paul this said rather let
[2:08:22] brotherly love continue.
[2:08:31] Can I just consume a little bit here?
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; So Pentecost is it's a long quote but
[2:08:34] let me just read it. Pentecost had I'm
[2:08:37] speaking Pentecost meaning the first
[2:08:38] group of apostles and disciples they had
[2:08:41] a brother that wasn't greedy. They sold
[2:08:44] everything they had for the furthering
[2:08:46] of the church. They were so together
[2:08:48] till even one heard the other one died
[2:08:51] they says let us go and die with him.
[2:08:54] Such a feeling. Now Jesus spoke to this
[2:08:56] and says all this says rather says let
[2:08:59] brotherly love continue brotherly love
[2:09:02] continue that was in the first church
[2:09:04] but something taken place and there was
[2:09:06] a fellow come in by the name in the
[2:09:08] former world and when he began to eat
[2:09:10] that vine of brother-in-law
[2:09:18] that was no he says no that that that
[2:09:21] that insect came the first thing that he
[2:09:24] had to take in the church was that
[2:09:26] brotherly love, that connection, that
[2:09:29] feeling to one another. Once you remove
[2:09:32] in the church, it becomes only a
[2:09:34] political group.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; You can say a few words and everything,
[2:09:38] it becomes a political group. But we
[2:09:41] need that love and connection for one
[2:09:43] another, brothers and sisters. THAT'S
[2:09:45] WHAT MAKES US A CHURCH.
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:09:51] So when begin to eat that vine of the
[2:09:53] brother love he cut the very sap line of
[2:09:55] it because it doesn't make any
[2:09:57] difference how smart we are how much we
[2:10:01] think we know how much we want to be
[2:10:03] different from somebody else and as long
[2:10:06] as that brotherly feeling isn't among us
[2:10:09] we are fighting a losing battle that's
[2:10:13] right we can't win there is no way for
[2:10:16] us to win if there is not THAT BROTHER
[2:10:20] BUT THANK GOD, GOD HAD A PROMISE. I WILL
[2:10:24] RESTORE.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; THAT CAME TO RESTORE THAT BROTHERLY

[2:10:37] GOD. ONE BROTHER CAME HERE AND I ALWAYS
[2:10:39] I always remember what he said. He told
[2:10:41] us, "OH BROTHERS, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
[2:10:43] YOU HAVE IN THAT LITTLE CHURCH. THAT
[2:10:46] LITTLE CHURCH IS SO UNITED. THAT
[2:10:48] RESTORED WORD FELLOWSHIP IS SO UNITED.

[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; Many times, Father, we go about this
[2:24:01] walk seeking all kinds of mysteries,
[2:24:04] Lord. But there's no mystery far greater
[2:24:07] than the very life of Christ.
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; Father, we pray, oh God, every brother
[2:24:12] and every sister here, Lord, would will
[2:24:14] be taken far deeper, Lord Jesus, that
[2:24:17] our walk with you will go deep, Lord.
[2:24:19] &gt;&gt; We can allow our being, Lord Jesus, to
[2:24:22] be vessels out of which you will
[2:24:24] minister to the body. Lord,
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; Father, that we can really feel for one
[2:24:27] another, Lord.
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; For Lord, you told us, Lord, where the
[2:24:31] spirit of the Lord is. M
[2:24:33] &gt;&gt; these are the kinds of fruits that it
[2:24:35] will bear.
[2:24:36] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we profess we have the Holy
[2:24:37] Ghost.
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; So we are asking you, oh God, take these
[2:24:40] vessels, Lord.

[2:24:52] TOLD us
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; we should lay aside all these things,
[2:24:55] Father.
